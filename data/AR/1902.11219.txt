ABSTRACT

We present the analysis of infrared (IR) observations of the planetary nebula NGC 40
together with spectral analysis of its [WC]-type central star HD 826. Spitzer IRS observations
were used to produce spectral maps centred at polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) bands
and ionic transitions to compare their spatial distribution. The ionic lines show a clumpy
distribution of material around the main cavity of NGC 40, with the emission from [Ar ii]
being the most extended, whilst the PAHs show a rather smooth spatial distribution. Analysis
of ratio maps shows the presence of a toroidal structure mainly seen in PAH emission, but
also detected in a Herschel PACS 70 µm image. We argue that the toroidal structure absorbs
the UV ﬂux from HD 826, preventing the nebula to exhibit lines of high-excitation levels as
suggested by previous authors. We discuss the origin of this structure and the results from the
spectral analysis of HD 826 under the scenario of a late thermal pulse.

1 INTRODUCTION

Planetary nebulae (PNe) are formed as a result of the last gasps in the
life of low- and intermediate-mass stars (Mi .8 M
). Previously,
these stars have evolved to become asymptotic giant branch stars
(AGB) that eject large amounts of mass into their circumstellar
medium through dense and slow winds to ﬁnally reach the post-
AGB phase where they develop fast stellar winds and strong ionising
photon ﬂux. The wind-wind interaction creates an inner cavity while
the UV ﬂux from the central star photoionises the material, creating
a PN (e.g., Balick 1987).

⊙

The PN NGC 40 around the hydrogen deﬁcient star HD 826
presents a variety of morphological features that uncover the dif-
ferent stages of mass ejection in the formation of PNe. As shown
in the colour-composite picture presented in Figure 1, the nebula
has a barrel-like main cavity whose northern and southern caps
open into a set of lobes or blisters, sometimes associated with jets,
although there is not kinematical evidence of fast outﬂows (see,
e.g., Meaburn et al. 1996). A set of optical and IR concentric rings
surround the main cavity (Corradi et al. 2004; Ramos-Larios et al.
2011), disclosing the last gasps in the AGB of HD 826, the central
star of NGC 40. The main nebula is surrounded by an extended ﬁla-
mentary structure, probably associated with heavy mass-loss events

during the AGB, whose morphology seems to suggest that the neb-
ula is interacting with the interstellar medium (ISM) due to its
relatively high velocity (Martin et al. 2002).

The nebula exhibits a large C/O ratio, as derived from abun-
dance determinations based on collisionally excited lines (e.g.,
Pottasch et al. 2003). This is in line with the carbon-rich [WC8]-type
of its central star (Crowther et al. 1998). Furthermore, the ISO IR
21 and 30 µm broad emission fea-
nebular spectrum also shows the
∼
tures detected in many C-rich AGB and PNe (see Forrest et al. 1981;
Sloan et al. 2014; Mishra et al. 2015; Sloan 2017, and references
therein), which can be associated with a carbon-rich chemistry,
including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) clusters, hydro-
genated amorphous carbon grains, hydrogenated fullerens, nanodia-
monds and unidentiﬁed carbonaceous material (Ramos-Larios et al.
2011). Detailed modelling of the PAH species in NGC 40 has been
recently presented by Boersma et al. (2018).

Spectral ﬁts to optical and UV spectroscopic observations
of HD 826 based on NLTE models agree that its eﬀective tem-
perature should be Teﬀ ≈
90 kK (Bianchi & Grewing 1987;
Leuenhagen et al. 1996; Marcolino et al. 2007). However, the neb-
ula presents low excitation, with the [O ii] λ 3727 doublet being
the strongest feature in the optical spectrum (e.g., Pottasch et al.
2003). Rough estimates based on the Zanstra and Stoy methods or
even highly sophisticated estimates using photo-ionisation models
point to an eﬀective temperature Teﬀ . 40 kK (Köppen & Tarafdar

posed the existence of a carbon-rich curtain around HD 826. These
authors argue that the absorption features seen in the resonance
transition of the C ii λλ1334.5,1335.7 doublet detected in IUE ob-
servations imply a dense, carbon-rich circumstellar envelope around
HD 826 expanding at a velocity lower than its terminal wind velocity

In this paper we use Spitzer IRS observations obtained in map
mode, Herschel PACS 70 µm, and Canada-France-Hawaii Tele-
scope (CFHT) images to assess the spatial distribution of ionic
species, PAHs, H2, and dust in the central region of NGC 40. The
comparison of their distributions indeed unveils the presence of
structures inside the main cavity of NGC 40 close to the central
star that may partially block its UV ﬂux. The paper is organized
as follows. We describe the observations used here in Section 2
and present our main results on the spatial distribution of diﬀerent
components in Section 3. We discuss these results and present a

possible origin for these structures in Section 4. Finally, a summary
of our ﬁndings and conclusions is given in Section 5.

2 OBSERVATIONS

We use here Spitzer Space Observatory observations of NGC 40
(program ID 50834, AORKey 29685248; PI: D. Weedman) obtained
on 2009 March 8. These correspond to Infrared Spectrograph (IRS)
observations performed in map mode using the short-low (SL) slits
covering the spectral range from 5.2 to 14.5 µm. Up to 160 slit
positions were placed on the main nebular cavity of NGC 40 (see
Figure 2), with another 160 slit positions for background subtraction.
The combination of the 160 slits onto NGC 40 cover an angular area
of

60′′. The pixel scale of the SL detector is 1.′′81.
64′′ ×
The IRS data were processed using the CUbe Builder for IRS

Spectra Maps (cubism; Smith et al. 2007). cubism was used to vi-
sualize spectral maps and to obtain spectra from diﬀerent regions
within NGC 40, as well as an integrated spectrum. Standard charac-
terization of noise, background subtraction, and bad bixel removal
procedures were followed.
To supplement

the Spitzer spectral maps of NGC 40, we
also analysed Spitzer IRAC and Herschel PACS observations. The
Spitzer IRAC observations correspond to the program ID 40115
(AORKey 21976576; PI: G. Fazzio) obtained on 2007 October
17, whereas the Herschel PACS data correspond to the observa-
tion ID 1342223905 (PI: T. Ueta) obtained on 2011 July 10. All
observations were downloaded from the NASA/IPAC Infrared Sci-
ence Archive2. We have also used near-IR CFHT observations of
NGC 40 obtained with the Wide-ﬁeld InfraRed Camera (WIRCam)
through the K broadband (λc=2.146 µm, ∆λ=0.325 µm) and H2 1-0
narrowband (λc =2.122 µm, ∆λ=0.032 µm) ﬁlters on 2008 July 18
(PI: P. Martin).

We also obtained UV and optical observations of HD 826 to
model its spectrum and estimate its stellar properties (see Discus-
sion section). HD 826 was observed by the Far Ultraviolet Spectro-
scopic Explorer (FUSE) and the International Ultraviolet Explorer
(IUE) satellites. Data from these observations have been retrieved
from MAST, the Multimission Archive at the Space Telescope
Science Institute3. We used the FUSE observations with Obs. ID
A08501010000 and A08501020000 (PI: H. Dinerstein) obtained on
2000 December 16 in the spectral range 916-1190 Å with total
exposure times of 15 and 26 ks.

For the IUE spectral range of 1230-1980 Å and 1900-3220 Å
only low dispersion spectra were availabe. We used the IUE datasets
with Obs. ID SWP03074 and LWR02656, both taken with the large

we obtained high-resolution FIbre-fed Echelle Spectrograph (FIES)
observations at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT). The observa-
tions were obtained on 2015 December 11 on service mode using
the high-resolution ﬁbre, which gives a resolution of R = 67000 for
the 3640–9110 Å wavelength range. The total FIES exposure time
was 900 s.

3 RESULTS

Figure 3 presents the integrated background-subtracted Spitzer IRS
spectrum of NGC 40. The spectrum was build adding all the emis-
sion coming from the nebular regions covered by the IRS slits as
shown in Fig. 2. The spectrum exhibits the clear presence of PAHs at
6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3 µm, as well as a small contribution of the 12.0
µm feature (see also ﬁgure 2 in Boersma et al. 2018). The spectrum
shows notable emission features from low ionisation species such
as [Ar ii] at 6.98 µm, [Ar iii] at 8.99 µm, and [Ne ii] at 12.81 µm.
A few weak H i emission lines are also present. In agreement with
Ramos-Larios et al. (2011), no H2 emission lines are detected in
the 5–14 µm spectral range.

The Spitzer IRS observations presented here provide us the
opportunity to study the spatial distribution of the emission from
the diﬀerent PAHs and low-ionisation emission lines detected in the
integrated spectrum of NGC 40. To perform this study, we used cu-
bism to create spectral maps centred at the lines of the low-ionisation
species and broad emission features of PAHs (see Figure 3). For all
maps, we subtracted the local continuum following the procedure
described in Smith et al. (2007). We do not show the spectral map
of the 7.7 µm PAH feature because it lays at the edge between the
two nodes of the SL orders. For completeness, we also extracted
a continuum image for the wavelength range between 13–14 µm,

spectral range. All panels have the same ﬁeld of view and orientation.

with no contribution from any line or PAH feature. For simplicity,
we labelled this spectral image as “continuum”. All spectral maps
are shown in Figure 4.

The spectral maps of the ionic species resemble the optical
images presented in Figure 1: a clumpy barrel-like main cavity with
two blobs aligned N-S just outside this cavity, which are spatially
coincident with the optical blobs or blisters. The [Ar ii], [Ar iii], and
[Ne ii] spectral maps present a limb-brightened morphology along
the minor axis of NGC 40, with emission peaking towards the west.
In contrast, the continuum image presents an elliptical shape with a
limb-brightened morphology with no apparent contribution to any
other morphological feature.

The spatial distribution of the emission in the PAH spectral
maps shares some of the properties of that of the emission lines
from ionised species, although some diﬀerences are noticeable.
The PAH emission also shows a limb-brightned morphology, with
brighter emission as well in the western region for the 6.3 and 11.3
µm features, but not for the 8.6 and 12 µm ones. Note, however, that
the emission from the PAHs seems more uniform within the main
cavity than that from the ionised emission lines, particularly for the
PAHs at 6.3, 8.6, and 11.3 µm (see Fig. 4 bottom panels). Otherwise,
the northen and southern blobs in the PAH spectral maps are located
closer to the inner cavity than those in the ionic species, but those
in the 11.3 µm PAH feature, which are spatially coincident.

To illustrate the distribution of the ionic species, the contin-
uum and the PAHs features, we present colour-composite images
combining diﬀerent spectral maps in the top panels of Fig. 5. The
top-left panel shows the comparison of the three ionic spectral maps.
This image clearly reveals the clumpy morphology of the emission
in the [Ar ii] and [Ne ii] lines, as well as the extent of the blowouts
north and south of the barrel-like main nebula. The top-middle panel
compares the distribution of the PAHs. Although the emission in the
6.3, 8.6, and 11.3 µm seems distributed rather uniformingly inside
the main cavity, the northern and southern edges of the barrel-like
structure show noticeable diﬀerences. The top-right panel compares

the continuum emission with those of the [Ar ii] emission line and
PAH feature at 11.3 µm. The dust continuum dominates the emis-
sion towards the northern and southern blowouts of the main cavity
in NGC 40.

The bottom row panels in Figure 5 present normalised inten-
sity spatial proﬁles extracted from the spectral maps shown in Fig. 4
along the E-W direction (i.e., PA=90◦) for those same spectral fea-
tures included in the colour-composite pictures of the top row. The
bottom-left panel conﬁrms that the [Ar ii] emission is more extended
towards the east than that of the [Ar iii] and [Ne ii] emission lines.
The variations of the [Ar ii] emission in the inner cavity reﬂects the
clumpy structure unveiled by its spectral map as shown in Fig. 4.
The comparison of the PAH proﬁles in the middle-bottom panel
show that the PAH at 11.3 µm is more extended towards the west
and is very similar in shape to that of the 6.3 µm PAH feature. These
proﬁles generally have a higher valley to peak ratio than those of
the ionised emission lines in the bottom-left panel. The peaks of
the 8.6 µm PAH lays just inside the other two proﬁles. Finally, the
bottom-right panel implies the continuum proﬁle has the highest
valley to peak ratio, the peaks are the broadest, and they peak inside
those of the PAH and emission lines from ionised species. The emis-
sion from the 11.3 µm PAH feature is very similar in shape to that
of the [Ar iii] emission, which is likely to be the position of the pho-
todissociated region in NGC 40. Moreover, we note that the [Ar ii]
ionic emission emcompasses that from the PAHs at 11.30 µm.

Figure 5 hints at the presence of structural components inside
the main cavity of NGC 40. In order to highlight this spatial feature,
we investigated diﬀerent ratio maps using the PAHs, continuum
and ionic species maps. Interestingly, the PAH ratios unveil a wide
structure inside the main cavity in NGC 40 extending from east to
west with a width
30′′. A similar structure can also be appreciated
when comparing the PAHs with the continuum map. We show in
Figure 6 the PAH 11.3/continuum and PAH 11.3/6.3 ratio images.
A dark lane seems to decrease the ratio maps at the middle plane

from east to west4. This structure is detected in emission in the
Herschel 70 µm image presented in Fig. 6 right panel. We note that

this structure is also easily spotted in the PAH ratio maps presented
by Boersma et al. (2018). In addition to brighter emission at the
equatorial region, this image unveils the presence of two blobs.

4 Similar ratio maps have been created using the continuum-subtracted ionic
line ([Ar ii], [Ar iii] and [Ne ii]) maps in order to search for diﬀerences in
ionisation structure but these images are dominated by clumpy emission and
the ration maps are not conclusive.

A wide-ﬁeld image of the Herschel PACS 70 µm is presented
in Figure 7 in comparison with other colour-composite IR images
of NGC 40. It is interesting to note that the CFHT near-IR images
(Fig. 7 right panel) show that H2 is not present in the main cavity,

but its emission can be traced as rays protrunding from it and along
the equatorial (East-West) plane.

A detailed analysis of the IR spectral energy distribution (SED)
of the diﬀerent morphological features of NGC 40 would be desir-
able, but the available data in the Herschel PACS Spectroscopy
Catalogue (Ramos-Medina et al. 2018)5 cannot spatially resolve
NGC 40. The spatial location of continuum emission and the dom-
inant emission line in the PACS 70 µm range, the [O i] 63.2 Å
emission line at cannot be determined. Future SOFIA observa-
tions will be used to spatially resolve the toroidal structure around
HD 826, to construct detailed SED at longer wavelengths, and to
further constrain the properties of these structures in NGC 40.

4 DISCUSSION

Boersma et al. (2018) reported the clear presence of PAH emission
around HD 826, the central star of NGC 40, although they reckon
there is no obvious substructure in their PAH charge maps. The
detailed comparison of Spitzer and Herschel mid-IR images and
ratio maps of NGC 40 shown in Fig. 6 shows it might be inter-
preted as a toroidal structure inside its ionised shell. Whereas its
detection in Herschel PACS 70 µm images is indicative of a dust
component, the Spitzer ratio maps reveal an important content of
PAHs, i.e., carbonaceous molecules. It is worthwhile to emphasize
that the spatial location of PAHs in NGC 40 does not follow the
typical stratiﬁed distribution of material seen in photo-dissociation
regions, where it is associated with dense knots and the presence of
other molecules such as H2 (see the case of NGC 6720 presented
by Cox et al. 2016). Neither it compares with the toroidal struc-
tures reported in PNe with dual-dust or mixed chemistry, i.e., PNe
with carbon- and oxygen-rich dust (see, e.g., Guzmán-Ramírez et al.
2014). In those cases, the tori have notable ionisation gradients, with
ionised species in the innermost regions and PAHs in their outer
edges, as the result of the formation of PAHs by photodissociation
of CO (Guzmán-Ramírez et al. 2011).

There is additional evidence of the presence of large amounts

of dust and carbon-rich material between HD 826 and the ionised
material of NGC 40. First, the morphology of this IR feature in
NGC 40 is similar to the emission map of the C iv λλ1548,1551 Å
UV emission lines in the image through the UVIT Sapphire ﬁlter
presented by Kameswara Rao et al. (2018). Then, the low ionisation
degree of the PAHs in NGC 40 points to a high internal attenuation,
up to AV & 20 mag (Boersma et al. 2018). This is in sharp contrast
with the extinction derived from the Balmer decrement derived from
nebular emission lines or the dip at λ2200 Å seen in UV spectra of
the central star, which imply AV ≈
1.2 (see Pottasch et al. 2003, for a
through discussion on this issue). Finally, we note the diﬀerent mid-
IR spectra of the toroidal structure and the barrell-shaped nebular
rim of NGC 40 (Figure 8). The spectrum of the latter ﬂattens at
longer wavelengths, whilst that of the toroidal structure, closer in
shape to the total nebular spectrum, rises up, indicating a larger
content of dust and molecules. This interpretation conﬁrms the
diﬀerential spectral results presented by Boersma et al. (2018).

4.1 NLTE analysis of HD 826

Such dusty, carbon-rich toroidal structure would absorb the hard
UV ﬂux from the central star of NGC 40, i.e., it would be the
carbon curtain proposed by Bianchi & Grewing (1987) to explain
the discrepancy between the high eﬀective temperature of HD 826
and the anomalously low excitation of the nebula around it. This
discrepancy has been questionned by studies modelling the neb-
ular emission, suggesting that the true temperature of HD 826
is lower, down to 38,000 K (Pottasch et al. 2003) or 50,000 K
(Monteiro & Falceta-Gonçalves 2011). To conﬁrm the discrepancy
between the eﬀective temperature of HD 826 and the nebular ex-
citation of NGC 40, we have analysed public UV (FUSE and
IUE) and optical FIES NOT spectra of HD 826 using the up-
dated version of the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)6 NLTE code
to produce a detailed atmospheric model (Gräfener et al. 2002;
Hamann & Gräfener 2004). Additional details on the computing
methods can be found in Todt et al. (2015) and references therein.

temperature and chemical composition, the equivalent width of any
emission line is largely determined by the ratio between the volume
emission measure of the wind and the area of the stellar surface,
which can be expressed in terms of the transformed radius Rt

is the micro-clumping parameter which is deﬁned as the density
contrast between wind clumps and a smooth wind of the same
mass-loss rate.

Our best-ﬁt model is compared to the optical and UV spectra
in Fig. 9, while the SED of HD 826 is shown in Fig. 10. The resul-
tant eﬀective temperature of our best-ﬁt, Teﬀ =70.8 kK (as also de-
rived by Marcolino et al. 2007), conﬁrms the hot status of HD 826
and our estimate for the Zanstra temperature is 45 kK. Although
Crowther et al. (2003) determined a higher temperature of 90 kK,
we ﬁnd that such temperature results in C iii emission lines much
weak than those observed. Moreover, the Leuenhagen et al. (1996)
models result in a too strong iron-forest between 1600
2000 Å and
too strong C iii emission lines.

Leuenhagen et al. (1996) and Marcolino et al. (2007) reported
a carbon mass-fraction of 50% in the atmosphere of HD 826,
whereas Crowther et al. (2003) found it to be lower,
40%. We
tested diﬀerent carbon mass-fractions and found them to range
between 30% and 50% are consistent with the observations, as
most lines are not very sensitive to the carbon mass-fraction rel-

He ii 5411 / C iv 5471 implies a C:He abundance ratio of 30:67, but
the strength of the C iii 5696 emission line suggests a higher carbon

lines of hydrogen are blended with He ii lines, thus the upper limit
of 2% of hydrogen by mass estimated by Leuenhagen et al. (1996)
cannot be conﬁrmed. As the spectral lines of neon are all blended
with other lines, only an upper limit for the neon abundance can
be provided, which is also not very strict, given the poor quality of
the IUE observations. We notice the absence of a strong F vi 1140
line, which is compatible with a solar ﬂuorine abundance. Similarly,
phosphorus, sulfur, and silicon solar abundances provide a good ﬁt
to the P, S, and Si UV and Si optical spectral lines.

4.2 On the origin of the carbon-rich curtain

The origin of the inner PAH toroidal structure in NGC 40 is in-
triguing. Whereas the large nebular C/O ratio (Pottasch et al. 2003)
suggests that the central star underwent the third dredge-up, bring-
ing the resultant 12C to the stellar surface and turning it into a
carbon-rich [WC] star (Herwig 2005), an eruptive process ejecting
carbon-rich material inside the ionised nebular shell seems more
likely. Herwig (2001) discussed several scenarios for the formation
of [WC]-type central stars of PNe through the late thermal pulse
(LTP) event. During this event, hydrogen-deﬁcient, carbon-rich ma-
terial is ejected from the central star inside the old hydrogen-rich
PN. This material coagulates rapidly into carbon-rich dust due to the
reduction of the eﬀective temperature of the central star. Interest-
ingly, the spatial distribution of the hydrogen-poor ejecta detected
in born-again PNe is generally described as disrupted disks and
bipolar ejections (e.g., Borkowski et al. 1994; Evans et al. 2006).

It is thus possible that the central star of NGC 40 experienced
a LTP, which ejected carbon-rich material preferentially along an

equatorial plane. As HD 826 came back to the post-AGB track and
developed a new fast stellar wind, this material formed dust grains
which are now just pushed away into a toroidal structure reach-
ing the edge of the barrel-like main cavity. Thus, the X-ray emis-
sion from NGC 40 detected by Chandra (see Montez et al. 2005)
might have an identical origin as that of the born-again PNe A 30
and A 78. In such cases, the carbon-rich material interacts with
the adiabatically-shocked bubble created by the current fast wind,
lowering its temperature to produce diﬀuse soft X-ray emission
(Guerrero et al. 2012; Fang et al. 2014; Toalá et al. 2015). Further-
more, the carbon curtain blocks a signiﬁcant fraction of the UV ﬂux
from HD 826, resulting in the anomalously low ionisation degree
of the nebular shell. Similar situation has been recently reported in
HuBi 1, a PN whose central star has experienced a very late thermal
pulse (VLTP) and the carbon-rich dusty ejecta has obscured the
star to a degree such that the outer hydrogen-rich nebular shell has
cooled down and started recombining (Guerrero et al. 2018). The
atmosphere of HD 826 consists mostly of He and C, with solar ni-
trogen and neon abundances and a likely presence of residual hydro-
gen. These chemical abundances, as expected from stellar evolution
models (e.g. Althaus et al. 2005), favor a LTP event rather than a
VLTP one (Todt & Hamann 2015).

Finally, we would like to mention the presence of several pairs
of jet-like ejections in NGC 40, including those unveiled by the Her-
schel PACS 70 µm image (see Figures 6 - right panel and Fig. 7). The
most extended are those reported by Meaburn et al. (1996, labelled
as Jet 1 in Fig. 1) and the bipolar structure just outside the barrel-like
main cavity in NGC 40 (Jet 2 in Fig. 1). Fast collimated ejections are

a typical signature of born-again PNe (see, e.g., Fang et al. 2014,
and references therein). The pair of blobs inside the main cavity
of NGC 40 (marked in Fig. 7 with dashed-line circular apertures)
could also be interpreted as collimated outﬂows. Their identiﬁca-
tion in optical or near-IR images has been hampered so far due to
the dominant clumpy structure of this PN.

5 SUMMARY

We presented an IR study of NGC 40 around the [WC]-type star
HD 826. The Spitzer IRS low-resolution spectrum of NGC 40 be-
tween 5 and 14 µm conﬁrms its low level of ionisation, as no
emission lines from high ionisation species are detected in this
spectrum. The main IR spectral features are emission lines from
low-ionisation species, such as [Ar ii], [Ar iii], and [Ne ii], and PAH
clusters at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.0 µm. No H2 emission lines
are detected in this spectrum, but the CFHT WIRCam H2 image
unveils the presence of molecular hydrogen just outside the main
cavity.

The analysis of IR observations of NGC 40 uncovered struc-
tures inside the inner cavity of NGC 40. The detection of these
structures in Spitzer IRS PAH ratio maps and a Herschel PACS 70
µm image seems to imply a high content of dust and carbon-rich
material. Notably, the structures can be traced in UV C iv images.
The morphology of this emissions suggests that a toroidal structure
surrounds HD 826.

The current available IR observations suggest that a dusty
carbon-rich toroidal structure is embedded inside the optical nebu-
lar shell of NGC 40. This toroidal structure around HD 826 would
absorb its UV ﬂux, as originally suggested by Bianchi & Grewing
(1987), causing the nebula to have low excitation. We propose that
this structure might have been originated by a late thermal pulse
event experienced by HD 826, which also turned it into a [WC]-
type star. This would make NGC 40 a member of the unpopulated
group of born-again PNe.

Future high-resolution mid- and far-IR images and spectra will
be pursuit and will be used to produce a complete modelling of
NGC 40. This will help characterise these structures and shed light
into their origin.
