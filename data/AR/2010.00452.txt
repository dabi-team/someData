Abstract 

Given the infrequency of extreme geomagnetic storms, it is significant to note the concentration of 

three extreme geomagnetic storms in 1941, whose intensities ranked fourth, twelfth, and fifth within 

the aa index between 1868 – 2010. Among them, the geomagnetic storm on 1 March 1941 was so 

intense  that  three  of  the  four  Dst  station  magnetograms  went  off  scale.  Herein,  we  reconstruct  its 

time series and measure the storm intensity with an alternative Dst estimate (Dst*). The source solar 

eruption at 09:29 – 09:38 GMT on 28 February was located at RGO AR 13814 and its significant 

intensity is confirmed by large magnetic crochets of 35 nT measured at Abinger. This solar eruption 

most  likely  released  a  fast  interplanetary  coronal  mass  ejection  with  estimated  speed  2260  km/s. 

After  its  impact  at  03:57  –  03:59  GMT  on  1  March,  an  extreme  magnetic  storm  was  recorded 

worldwide. Comparative analyses on the contemporary magnetograms show the storm peak intensity 

of  minimum  Dst*  ≤  −464  nT  at  16  GMT,  comparable  to  the  most  and  the  second  most  extreme

magnetic  storms  within  the  standard  Dst  index  since  1957.  This  storm  triggered  significant  low-

latitude aurorae in the East Asian sector and their equatorward boundary has been reconstructed as 

38.5° in invariant latitude. This result agrees with British magnetograms which indicate auroral oval 

moving above Abinger at 53.0° in magnetic latitude. The storm amplitude was even more enhanced 

in equatorial stations and consequently casts caveats on their usage for measurements of the storm 

intensity in Dst estimates. 

1. Introduction 

Solar eruptions occasionally direct interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) towards the Earth. 

When  they  have  sufficient  speed,  mass,  and  southward  interplanetary  magnetic  field  (IMF),  such 

geo-effective  ICMEs  cause  serious  geomagnetic  storms  and  variations  in  the  terrestrial  magnetic  field 

(Gonzalez et al., 1994; Daglis et al., 1999). Intensities of the subsequent geomagnetic storms have 

been  usually  measured  with  the  negative  peak  in  the  disturbance  storm  time  (Dst)  index  since  the 

International Geophysical Year (IGY: 1957 – 1958) as a representative of the ring current intensity. 

The  Dst  index  is  based  on  the  average  of  the  four  mid-latitude  magnetic  disturbances  at  four 

reference stations (e.g., Sugiura, 1964; Sugiura and Kamei, 1999; WDC for Geomagnetism at Kyoto 

et  al.,  2015).  Partially  due  to  their  geo-effectiveness,  such  solar  eruptions  have  been  subjected  to 

astronomical  interests  from  the  early  phase  of  the  modern  astrophysical  studies  (e.g.,  Carrington, 

1859; Hale, 1931; Cliver, 2006; Gopalswamy, 2016; Tsurutani et al., 2020). 

Within  this  chronological  coverage,  it  was  the  March  1989  storm  that  recorded  the  most  extreme 

intensity  (minimum  Dst  =  −589  nT;  WDC  for  geomagnetism  at  Kyoto  et  al.,  2015).  This  storm 

dramatically  extended  the  auroral  oval  equatorward  and  had  serious  economic  impacts  on  modern 

society  with  its  space  weather  hazards  (e.g.,  Allen  et  al.,  1989;  Cid  et  al.,  2014;  Pulkkinen  et  al., 

2017; Riley et al., 2018; Boteler, 2019). This case shows that such extreme geomagnetic storms are 

not only of academic interest, but also of societal interest due to our increasing reliance on modern 

technological  infrastructure  (e.g.,  Pulkkinen  et  al.,  2017;  Riley  et  al.,  2018).  Such  extreme  storms 

have been studied in terms of their chronological distributions (Kilpua  et al., 2015; Lefevre et al., 

2016) and revealed apparent correlations between the storm intensity and equatorward boundary of 

the auroral oval (Yokoyama et al., 1998). 

Statistical analyses of such extreme storms are challenging as they are rare (Yerasimov et al., 2013) 

and  only  five  storms  went  below  the  threshold  of  Dst  =  −400  nT  within  the  coverage  of  the  Dst

index routinely derived by WDC Kyoto,  (Riley et al., 2018; Meng et al., 2019). Among them, only 

the March 1989 storm developed beyond the threshold of Dst = −500 nT and has been considered as 

a  superstorm  (e.g.,  Boteler,  2019).  Furthermore,  reconstructions  of  historical  superstorms  have 

shown  that  geomagnetic  superstorms  such  as  the  events  occurring  in  September  1859,  February 

1872, and May 1921 set further benchmarks both in terms of storm intensities (minimum Dst ≤ −800 

nT)  and  equatorward  boundaries  of  the  auroral  oval  (e.g.,  Tsurutani  et  al.,  2003;  Silverman  and 

Cliver, 2001; Green and Boardsen, 2006; Cliver and Dietrich, 2013; Lakhina and Tsurutani, 2018; 

Hayakawa et al., 2018a, 2018b, 2019a, 2020c; Love et al., 2019b; Blake et al., 2020). Their impacts 

on  modern  technological  infrastructure  on  the  ground  and  in  space  are  estimated  to  be  even  more 

catastrophic  than  their  historical  impacts  (Daglis,  2001;  Baker  et  al.,  2008;  Cannon  et  al.,  2013; 

Hapgood, 2017; Riley et al., 2018; Oliveira et al., 2020).  

Despite existing efforts on the extension of the Dst index (e.g., Karinen and Mursula, 2005; Mursula 

et  al.,  2008),  it  is  challenging  to  quantitatively  measure  the  intensity  of  geomagnetic  superstorms 

before the IGY, as their significant intensity frequently makes contemporary magnetograms run off 

scale (Riley, 2017, p. 118) and geographical coverage of historical magnetograms was much scarcer 

in  the  past.  As  such,  Dst  estimates  (Dst*)  for  several  superstorms  have  been  reconstructed  with 

alternative  magnetograms  in  mid-latitude,  with  reasonable  longitudinal  separation,  and  quasi-

completeness in the hourly resolution. These case studies have been conducted on four geomagnetic 

superstorms  in  October/November  1903  (minimum  Dst*  ≈  −513  nT;  Hayakawa  et  al.,  2020a), 

September 1909 (minimum Dst* ≈ −595 nT; Hayakawa et al., 2019b; Love et al., 2019a), May 1921 

(minimum Dst* ≈ −907 ± 132 nT; Love et al., 2019b), and March 1946 (minimum Dst* ≤ −512 nT; 

Hayakawa et al., 2020b). 

However,  historical  magnetograms  show  that  these  storms  are  only  a  small  sample  of  extreme 

geomagnetic  storms  in  history.  Among  them,  the  geomagnetic  conditions  in  1941  were  especially 

notable,  hosting  at  least  three  geomagnetic  storms  in  March,  July,  and  September,  which  ranked 

fourth,  twelfth,  and  fifth  within  the  aa  index  in  1868  –  2010,  respectively  (Lefèvre  et  al.,  2016). 

Colourful auroral episodes for the September 1941 storm have been introduced in Love and Coïsson 

(2016),  whereas  little  is  known  for  the  other  two.  On  the  other  hand,  the  March  1941  storm  had 

equally or even more extreme episodes, with magnetograms at three of four Dst stations going off-

scale.  In  fact,  this  storm  had  the  third  largest  ΔH  deviation  measured  at  the  Greenwich-Abinger 

observatories (1650 nT to 1710 nT) within the 112 great storms during 1874 – 1954 (Jones, 1955, p.

79; see also Newton, 1941) and was ranked the fourth most intense within the aa index during 1868 

– 2010 (Lefèvre et al., 2016). Shifting down to the mid-latitudes, this storm ranked in the seventh 

largest (> 560 nT) within the storms recorded at Kakioka ΔH between 1924 and 20201, despite its 

incomplete measurement. Therefore, in this manuscript, we analyse the time series of this extreme 

space/geomagnetic storm on 1 March 1941 with its source flare on 28 February 1941 from its source 

solar  eruption  to  its  terrestrial  impact.  In  addition,  we  measure  its  intensity  in  Dst*  based  on 

alternative magnetograms and examine the equatorial boundary of the auroral oval. 

2. Solar Eruption 

In  the  declining  phase  of  Solar  Cycle  17  after  its  maximum  in  April  1937  (Table  1  of  Hathaway, 

2015; Figure 2 of Clette and Lefèvre, 2016), the solar surface in late February to early March 1941 

was moderately eruptive but not as much as in April – September. Of the 27 solar flares recorded in 

the Hα observations, 7 flares were observed in RGO AR 13814 (D’Azambuja, 1942). Those flares 

were mostly categorised as 1 (Hα flare area = 100 – 250 msh) to 2 (Hα flare area = 250 – 600 msh) 

in their Hα flare area, whereas one on 3 March achieved importance of 3 (Hα flare area = 600 – 1200 

msh) (D’Azambuja, 1942; see also Švestka, 1976, p. 14).

the  sky.  The  MWO  AR  7132  corresponds  to  RGO  AR  13814  (courtesy  of  the  Mt.  Wilson 

Observatory; see also Pevtsov et al., 2019). 

Upon contemporary observations, Newton (1941, p. 84) apparently associated our great storm with 

“a fairly large sunspot not far from the central meridian”. As shown in Figure 1, Newton (1941) most 

likely  indicated  RGO  AR  13814  with  this  description.  Rather  than  the  chromospheric  eruptions, 

Newton (1941) listed three notable ionospheric disturbances with “wireless fade-outs” as footprints 

of solar flares at 15:45 – 16:10 GMT on 27 February, and 09:30 – 10:30 GMT and 15:27 – 15:40 

GMT on 28 February. Among them, Newton (1941, p. 84) considered the second wireless fade-out 

as the source eruption and clarified the sky over Greenwich overcast. The third fade-out coincides 

chronologically  with  “a  very  small  sudden  commencement  disturbance”  at  15:26  on  28  February 

reported at Hermanus (Ogg, 1941, p. 372). This sunspot developed to 650 millionth solar hemisphere 

immediately after its central meridian passage on 27.3 February 1941 (Newton, 1941, p. 85).  

Contemporary magnetograms confirm his discussions with magnetic crochets (see McIntosh, 1951), 

as footprints of intense X-ray radiation of solar flares (see Curto et al., 2016; Curto, 2020). Figure 2 

shows  digitised  magnetograms  at  Abinger,  Eskdalemuir,  and  Lerwick  on  28  February  –  1  March 

1941.  We  have  digitised  their  scans  hosted  by  BGS2 based  on  the  scale  units  shown  in  Hartnell 

(1922, p. 2) and the min-max scale values given in the observatory yearbooks (AMMO, 1958, p. 21, 

109; Jones, 1954, p. D21). Our digitisations have located magnetic crochets around 09:29  – 09:38 

GMT on 28 February with notable amplitudes: ≈ 13 nT at Lerwick, ≈ 20 nT, at Eskdalemuir, and ≈ 

35 nT at Abinger, respectively (c.f., McIntosh, 1951; Jones, 1955, p. 81).  

Interestingly, significant polar cap absorption was reported at Tikhaya Bay (N80°19′, E52°47′) for 4 

days  since  somewhere  between  22  GMT  on  26  February  and  6  GMT  on  27  February  and  caused 

blackouts for 99 hours (Besprozvannaya, 1962, p. 147; see also Cliver et al., 1990, p. 17109). Such 

polar cap absorptions indicate presence of solar proton events (e.g., Shea and Smart, 2012), as shown 

from  their  known  pairs  with  the  intense  solar  proton  events  (Besprozvannaya,  1962;  McCracken, 

2007; Usoskin et al., 2020). While only one minor flare was reported in this onset interval (0:36 UT 

on  27  February  at  Mt.  Wilson;  D’Azambuja,  1942,  p.  80),  this  implies  some  of  the  flares  in  this 

sequence from RGO AR 13814 probably caused notable solar proton events. This implies that the

source flare around 09:29 – 09:38 GMT on 28 February also possibly caused a solar proton event.  

Figure 2: Magnetic disturbances at Lerwick, Eskdalemuir, and Abinger spanning from 28 February 

to 1 March 1941 digitised from their original magnetograms at BGS and trace copy of Ogg (1941). 

The  dashed  orange  lines  show  the  recorded  hourly  values  at  Eskdalemuir  (AMMO,  1958).  These 

magnetograms show magnetic crochets at 09:29 – 09:38 GMT and the SSCs at 03:57 – 03:59 GMT.  

3. Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection 

These crochets were followed by storm sudden commencements at ≈ 03:57 – 03:59 on 1 March, as 

summarised  in  Table  1.  Among  them,  Hermanus  reported  two  SSCs  at  03:58  (ΔH  =  42  nT)  and

05:19 (ΔH = 48 nT) which probably indicates arrivals of at least two consecutive ICMEs. The time 

lag between the magnetic crochet and the SSCs shows the transit time of the ICME as 18.4 hours 

and imply the average speed of this ICME as 2260 km/s.  

Siscoe et al. (1968) and Burton et al. (1975) provide the following empirical formula for dynamic 

pressure computations as a function of geomagnetic field variations: 

∆𝑃![nPa] = 4.0´10"#𝐷𝑠𝑡$ .   (1) 

At the instance of maximum compression, Dst* shows the SSC amplitude 𝛥B ~ 35 nT, and equation 

(1)  yields  DPd  ~  4.9  nPa.  This  ram  pressure  is  almost  8  times  larger  than  the  ram  pressure  during 

quiet  solar  wind  conditions,  namely  ~0.75  nPa  for  solar  wind  speed  of  300  km/s  and  solar  wind 

density  of  5  cm-3.  In  addition,  by  assuming  equilibrium  conditions  during  the  interactions  of  the 

magnetosphere  with  the  solar  wind,  the  resulting  inward  magnetopause  position  is  given  by

where B0 is the contemporary dipole magnetic field at the Earth’s surface at L=1, 𝜇. is the vacuum 

permeability,  and  K  is  an  arbitrary  factor.  According  to  the  IGRF  model  for  the  epoch  of  1940 

(Thébault et al., 2015), the spherical harmonic coefficients g1

0, g1

1, and h1

1 are -30654 nT, -2292 

nT, and 5821 nT, respectively, which yield B0 of 32286 nT. Assuming that K = 2 and that Pd = 5.65 

nPa  (=0.75+4.9  nPa),  Xmp  ~  7.2  RE.  By  comparing  this  result  with  the  magnetopause  standoff 

position during nominal solar wind conditions (~10.1RE for Pd = 0.75 nPa), one concludes that the 

magnetopause  moved  ~3RE  inwards.  However,  the  magnetopause  did  not  surpass  the  threshold  of 

geosynchronous orbit (~6.6 RE), which could expose satellites to the hostile solar wind environment 

(e.g.,  Baker  et  al.,  2017).  The  most  inward  observed  magnetopause  motion,  ~5.24  RE  from  the 

Earth’s  center  (Hoffman  et  al.,  1975)  occurred  as  a  result  of  the  impact  of  the  fastest  CME  to  hit 

Earth  ever  recorded,  with  speed  2850  km/s  (Vaisberg  and  Zastenker,  1976;  Cliver  et  al.,  1990). 

Therefore,  these  results  show  that  the  impact  of  the  likely  CME  in  March  1941  had  moderate 

compression  of   the Earth’s magnetosphere.

Table  1:  Recorded  amplitudes  of  SSC  and  geomagnetic  storms  (ΔH)  at  each  observatory.  Their 

magnetic  latitude  is  computed  with  IGRF-12  model  (Thébault  et  al.,  2015).  The  stations  with 

asterisk  (*)  are  the  reference  stations  in  our  estimate.  The  observational  data  at  Apia  are  acquired 

only  with  its  hourly  value  from  the  WDC  Kyoto  (WDC  for  geomagnetism  at  Kyoto)  and  do  not 

show the SSC amplitude and the H-variation in the spot value.  

4. Magnetic Disturbance 

After  the  ICME  arrival  at  03:57  GMT,  the  intense  magnetic  storm  developed  so  rapidly  that  a 

number of the ground-based magnetograms went off the scale  at that time. This makes the estimate 

of  the  intensity  for  this  storm  rather  challenging.  While  the  Dst  index  has  been  used  to  evaluate 

storm  intensity  as  a  quantitative  measurement  for  the  ring  current  development,  the  March  1941 

storm  occurred  far  before  its  introduction.  The  standard  Dst  index  has  been  measured  with  an 

average of the four  stations (Kakioka, Honolulu, San Juan, and Hermanus) with weighting of their 

magnetic  latitude  (Sugiura,  1964;  WDC  for  Geomagnetism  at  Kyoto  et  al.,  2015).  However,  the 

March 1941 storm was only incompletely recorded at three of these standard stations, during 14 – 16 

and 18 GMT at Kakioka, 16 – 17 GMT at Honolulu, and 14 – 22 GMT at San Juan3. These data gaps 

affect any attempts to extend the Dst index upon this storm with the use of existing Dst reference 

stations (see Riley, 2018; c.f., Karinen and Mursula, 2005, 2006).  

As such, we need to substitute these three stations with three mid-to low-latitude magnetograms in 

similar magnetic longitudes without significant data gaps to estimate Dst equivalent measure of the 

storm intensity. Three magnetograms at Watheroo (WAT), Apia (API), and Tucson (TUC) satisfy this 

requirement  and  are  used  to  replace  the  incomplete  data  from  Kakioka,  Honolulu,  and  San  Juan,

respectively.  We  have  derived  their  hourly  data  from  the  WDC  for  geomagnetism  at  Kyoto. 

Following  the  procedure  of  the  standard  Dst  calculations,  we  have  first  derived  the  hourly 

disturbance at each station (Di (t)), subtracting the baseline (Bi) and solar quiet field variations (Sqi 

(t)). We then averaged the hourly disturbance at each station with weighting of their contemporary 

magnetic  latitude  (λi)  (Sugiura,  1964;  WDC  for  geomagnetism  at  Kyoto  et  al.,  2015).  These 

calculations are summarised by the following two equations. 

(3) 

(4) 

In our analyses, the baseline (Bi) has been approximated with the observatory annual means for each 

station, provided in the WDC for geomagnetism at Edinburgh4. The solar quiet field variation (Sqi 

(t)) has been approximated with the five quietest days in the previous month of this storm (27, 12, 

19, 18, and 1 February 1941), which have been selected on the basis of the revised daily aa index 

provided in Lockwood et al. (2018a, 2018b). The magnetic latitude of each station in 1941 has been 

computed with the angular distance of these stations and position of the magnetic pole in 1941 using 

the archaeo-magnetic field model IGRF-12 (Thébault et al., 2015). 

Its  validity  has  been  checked  in  comparison  with  the  standard  Dst  index  provided  in  WDC  for 

Geomagnetism at Kyoto et al. (2015). As the hourly data of Watheroo Observatory is available only 

until  1958  (WDC  for  Geomagnetism  at  Kyoto,  2020),  we  have  only  a  two-year  overlap  with  the 

standard Dst index. Here, we have examined the extreme geomagnetic storm in 1957 September, the 

largest storm in this interval, and the third-largest in the coverage of the standard Dst index (WDC 

for  geomagnetism  at  Kyoto  et  al.,  2015).  With  our  procedure  and  the  same  selections  of  the 

reference stations (WAT, HER, TUC, and API),, we have computed its minimum Dst* estimate ≈ −

399 nT, in contrast with that of = −427 nT in the official Dst index. This shows a difference of 28 nT 

and a relative difference of 7.6%, which is almost consistent with the variation of Dst estimate and 

standard Dst index derived in Love  et al. (2019). Note that both of the test cases in our study and 

Love et al. (2019) show the Dst estimate as more conservative than the standard Dst value. As such,

been summarised in Figure 4. Our reconstruction shows its intensity in the minimum Dst* estimate 

of ≈ −464 nT. The reconstructed time series shows a positive excursion peaked at 79 nT at 05 GMT 

after the ICME arrival at 03:57 GMT, probably because of the combination with the second SSC at 

05:09  GMT  reported  at  Hermanus  (Ogg,  1941).  Afterward,  this  storm  shows  an  initial  negative 

excursion down to −180 nT at 09 GMT with temporal recovery to −64 nT at 12 GMT. The magnetic 

field  was  exposed  to  a  steep  decrease  at  15  GMT  and  then  peaked  to  −464  nT  at  16  GMT  on  1 

March and a gradual recovery phase up to early 3 March. This “two-step” time series is consistent 

with  the  frequent  geomagnetic  behaviour  in  major  geomagnetic  storms  (Kamide  et  al.,  1998), 

resulted  from  variable  IMF,  a  combination  of  shock-sheath  and  following  magnetic  cloud,  or  a 

combination  of  multiple  ICMEs  (Daglis  et  al.,  2003;  Richardson  and  Zhang,  2008;  Lugaz  et  al., 

2016). Near the first negative dip, the D0/cos λ  value decreased steeper at API than at HER. This can 

be  attributed  to  the  asymmetric  development  of  the  storm-time  ring  current  (Cummings,  1966),  in 

which the intensity of the storm-time ring current is highest in the dusk-midnight sector, whereas it is 

lowest in dawn-noon sector. The in-situ observation shows that the asymmetry is prominent during 

the  storm  main  phase  because  fresh  ions  are  transported  from  the  nightside  plasma  sheet  to  the 

duskside  by  the  enhanced  magnetospheric  convection  (Ebihara  et  al.,  2002).  During  the  recovery 

phase,  the  asymmetry  is  relaxed  because  of  the  dominance  of  the  westward  grad-B  and  curvature 

drift motion of the ions (Ebihara et al., 2002). Note that the API magnetogram has a data gap on 2 

March in UT, whereas this data gap falls in the gradual recovery phase and hence does not affect our 

intensity reconstruction. In fact, our Dst* estimate curve (continuous black curve) and one without 

API data (broken black curve) are shown in Figure 4. Closer inspection shows that, at Tucson, “At 

about 16 h the H-reserve spot went off scale negative for a range in excess of 550 gammas” (White, 

1941,  p.  257),  whereas  its  hourly  data  are  without  break.  Therefore,  it  is  probable  that  Tucson 

magnetogram went off scale for a short time and made the hourly value slightly more conservative 

than the reality. Therefore, we consider our intensity estimate as a conservative estimate and describe 

its intensity as minimum Dst* ≤ −464 nT.

5. Low-Latitude Aurorae 

Around its peak recorded at 16 GMT on 1 March, the East Asian sector was favourably situated in 

the midnight sector for the auroral visibility. Indeed, the aurorae have been reported in Manchuria 

and northern Japan at that time. In Manchuria, aurorae were reported at Hǎilāĕr (N49°13′, E119°46′; 

37.8° MLAT) during 23:05 (1 March) – 00:18 (2 March) in LT and 01:40 – 02:20 (2 March) in LT, 

namely 15:05 – 16:18 and 17:40 – 18:20 (1 March) in GMT. The aurorae were reported as reddish 

glows moving from NW to E in the first part and then as reddish glows with stripes moving from NE 

to NW in the second part (Shèngjīng Shíbào, 1941-03-08, p. 4). This implies that the aurora moved 

eastward in the premidnight, and westward in the postmidnight. Its motion is, in part, consistent with 

low-latitude aurorae, in which the eastward motion and the westward motion were observed in the 

dusk-side (Shiokawa et al., 1994).

In  northern  Japan,  aurorae  were  reported  on  both  sides  of  Soya  Strait.  At  Otomari  (N46°38′, 

E142°46′; 36.5° MLAT), the aurorae were reported during 23:00 (1 March) – 03:55 (2 March) in LT 

(14:00  –  18:55  on  1  March  in  GMT),  as  reddish  glow  with  various  intensities.  At  Wakkanai 

(N45°25′,  E141°40′;  35.2°  MLAT),  diffuse  reddish  aurorae  were  visible  during  22:56  (1  March)  – 

04:30  (2  March)  in  LT  (13:56  –  19:30  on  1  March  in  GMT).  At  its  maximum,  the  aurora  altitude 

reached  almost  up  to  the  zenith.  At  Oshitomari  (N45°14′,  E141°13′;  35.0°  MLAT),  red-yellowish 

glow with stripes in bluish white was visible during 01:05 – 03:30 (2 March) in LT (16:05 – 18:30 

on 1 March in GMT) and its altitude reached up to 60 – 70° at its maximum (Kisho Yoran, 1941, pp. 

267 – 269; see Figure 5). 

Figure  5:  Japanese  auroral  sketches  at  Oshitomari  reproduced  from  Kisho  Yoran  (1941,  p.  268)  in 

red-yellowish background with bluish-white stripes at its maximum (left) and after its decay (right). 

The  bluish-white  stripes  are  shown  in  continuous  lines  and  broken  lines.  The  red-yellowish  glows 

are  shown  in  the  background  sky.  The  island  depicted  below  is  Rebun  Island  northward  from 

Oshitomari.  

The  auroral  visibility  in  the  East  Asian  sector  lasted  ≈  14  –  18.5  GMT  and  is  chronologically 

consistent with the main phase of this geomagnetic storm. In addition, a short telegraph disturbance 

was  reported  at  Oshitomari  during  01:55  –  02:05  on  2  March  in  LT  (16:55  –  17:05  GMT  on  1 

March) and this is chronologically located immediately after the peak of this storm at 16 GMT on 1 

March (Kisho Yoran, 1941, pp. 267 – 269). 

Among these records, those at Wakkanai at 35.2° MLAT and Oshidomari at 35.0° MLAT provide the 

elevation angle of the auroral visibility almost up to the zenith and up to 60 – 70°, respectively. On 

their  basis,  the  equatorward  boundary  of  the  auroral  oval  (EBAO)  is  estimated  37.6°  and  38.5°  in

invariant  latitude  (ILAT)  in  terms  of  footprints  of  the  magnetic  field  lines,  assuming  the  auroral 

altitude as ≈ 400 km (Roach et al., 1960; Ebihara et al., 2017). These values almost coincide with 

one another. The slight equatorward extension in the former may be tentatively associated with the 

different  extension  of  the  SAR  (stable  auroral  red)  arcs  and  reddish  aurorae.  This  is  because  SAR 

arcs are typically without visible structure (Kozyra et  al., 1997) and consistent with the Wakkanai 

report with diffuse reddish glow. On the other hand, what was described in the Oshitomari report is 

certainly  an  auroral  display,  being  described  as  a  reddish  glow  with  stripes  respectively  (Kisho 

Yoran, 1941, pp. 267 – 269).  

6. Conclusion and Discussion 

In this contribution, we have analysed the time series of the extreme space weather event in February 

–  March  1941.  Despite  the  lack  of  optical  evidence  of  the  source  solar  flare,  contemporary 

magnetograms have shown significant magnetic crochets (ΔH ≈ 35 nT at Abinger) at 09:29 – 09:38 

GMT on 28 March. This is synchronised with a significant polar cap absorption lasting for 4 days 

since 26/27 February and probably associated with a notable solar proton event.  

The driving ICME impact was recorded with SSCs at 03:57 – 03:59 on 1 March (Table 1). On their 

basis, the ICME speed has been computed as 2260 km/s. By applying well-known empirical models 

for  the  solar  wind  dynamic  pressure  and  the  magnetopause  stand-off  position  at  the  instance  of 

maximum compression, it was found that they are 4.9 nPa and 7.2 RE, respectively. This calculated 

average ICME speed ranks the ICME as being the fourth fastest on record following those in August 

1972,  September  1859,  and  February  1946  (Cliver  et  al.,  1990;  Cliver  and  Svalgaard,  2004; 

Gopalswamy et al., 2005; Knipp et al., 2018; Chertok, 2020). This subsequent geomagnetic activity 

may have been caused by the CME sheath and/or magnetic cloud (Lugaz et al., 2016; Kilpua et al., 

2019). 

We  have  reconstructed  its  time  series  and  intensity  (minimum  Dst*  ≤  −464  nT  at  16  GMT  on  1 

March  1941)  based  on  the  hourly  magnetic  measurements  at  Hermanus,  Watheroo,  Apia,  and 

Tucson.  Our  intensity  estimate  has  placed  this  storm  in  an  extreme  category,  as  only  five 

geomagnetic storms exceeded the threshold of Dst = −400 nT during the space age, for the last 63 

years (e.g., Meng et al., 2019). Indeed, this intensity is more extreme than the second most intense 

storm in July 1959 (minimum Dst = −429 nT) but considerably less than the most intense storm in 

March  1989  (minimum  Dst  =  −589  nT),  within  the  standard  Dst  index  since  the  IGY  (WDC  for

geomagnetism  at  Kyoto  et  al.,  2015).  While  this  storm  is  slightly  more  moderate  than  historical 

superstorms  in  September  1859,  February  1872,  October/November  1903,  September  1909,  May 

1921,  and  March  1946  (Cliver  and  Dietrich,  2013;  Hayakawa  et  al.,  2018a,  2019a,  2019b,  2020a, 

2020b, 2020c; Love et al., 2019a, 2019b), its intensity is significantly notable and in modern times 

its consequences would be quite serious. 

With  its  peak  around  16  GMT,  the  East  Asian  sector  was  favourably  situated  for  the  auroral 

observations. Indeed, the East Asian auroral records imply the EBAO as 38.5° ILAT. The temporal 

and spatial evolution of the auroral oval compares well with the magnetic disturbances in the high- 

resolution  British  magnetograms  (Figure  2).  From  the  first  SSC  at  03:58,  the  vertical  components 

(Bz) at each of the British operated observatories appear to be broadly coherent. From 13:30 − 14:30, 

Lerwick witnessed a sharp decrease in Bz with a simultaneous increase in the horizontal component 

(BH), while Abinger and Eskdalemuir witnessed a large increase Bz, and a staggered increase in BH. 

This most likely indicates that an eastward Hall current flew broadly in the ionosphere over Lerwick 

(62.6° MLAT) and Eskdalemuir (58.6° MLAT) (Rostocker, 1973). After 14:30, the broadly coherent 

variations  between  the  Eskdalemuir  and  Lerwick  Bz  suggests  that  the  eastward  Hall  current  had 

moved  southward  of  Eskdalemuir.  The  minimum  reported  Bz  for  Abinger  in  Jones  (1954)  may 

indicate  that  the  eastward  ionospheric  current  went  southward  beyond  Abinger  (53.0°  MLAT)  by 

16:30.  Around  this  time,  Abinger  saw  large  positive  BH  variations,  indicating  the  proximity  of 

auroral  currents.  From  17:10  onwards,  the  Bz  at  Abinger  is  anti-correlated  with  Lerwick  and 

Eskdalemuir,  again  indicating  an  eastward  ionospheric  current  between  Eskdalemuir  and  Abinger, 

until around 20:30, when the geomagnetic activity begins to gradually subside at all sites.  

On  the  other  hand,  Hermanus  shows  characteristics  of  the  ring  current  instead  of  ionospheric 

currents. This indicates that Lerwick was at one point probably near the poleward boundary of the 

auroral  oval,  Eskdalemuir  and  Abinger  were  almost  under  the  auroral  oval  except  for  the  storm 

maximum,  and  the  auroral  oval  probably  extended  more  equatorward  than  Abinger  around  the 

maximum.  The  auroral  oval  likely  did  not  reach  latitudes  low  enough  to  affect  measurements  at 

Hermanus in the Southern Hemisphere. Assuming that the evolution of the auroral ovals in the both 

hemispheres were similar with one another, this time series agrees with the maximum of the auroral 

activity  around  16  GMT  and  its  spatial  evolution  of  |38.5|°  ILAT,  situated  between  MLATs  of 

Abinger (|53.0|° MLAT) and Hermanus (|33.2|° MLAT).

This  temporal  evolution  compares  the  auroral  expansion  with  those  during  the  October/November 

1903 storm (minimum Dst* ≈ −531 nT vs. EBAO ≈ 44.1° ILAT; Hayakawa et al., 2020a), the March 

1946 storm (minimum Dst* ≤ −512 nT vs. EBAO ≤ 41.8° ILAT; Hayakawa et al., 2020b), and the 

March 1989 storm (minimum Dst = −589 nT vs. EBAO = 35 – 40.1° ILAT; Rich and Denig, 1992; 

Boteler,  2019).  As  such,  this  auroral  expansion  is  certainly  not  as  extreme  as  those  during  the 

superstorms in 1859 and 1921 (minimum Dst* ≈ −900 nT; Cliver and Dietrich, 2013; Love et al., 

2019; Hayakawa et al., 2019a) but still are comparable with those around the minimum Dst* ≈ −500 

nT. 

Interestingly, as shown in Table 1, the reported amplitudes of geomagnetic disturbance in spot value 

are more significant at the equatorial stations (1180 nT at Huancayo and > 785 nT at Alibag) than at 

mid-latitude stations (> 550 nT at Tucson and 614 nT at Hermanus), while the lost value with the 

magnetogram  saturations  still  reserve  possibility  of  local  extreme  disturbances  at  mid-latitude 

stations.  This  is  comparable  with  the  trend  seen  in  the  March  1946  storm,  where  the  equatorial 

magnetograms  showed  more  significant  disturbances  than  the  mid-latitude  magnetograms  (Table  1 

of Hayakawa et al., 2020b). The contrast of the minimum Dst* ≤ −464 nT with Huancayo spot value 

= 1180 nT casts serious caveats on existing discussions of the 1859 geomagnetic superstorms with 

spot value at the single equatorial station (e.g., Tsurutani et al., 2003), and requires investigations of 

further mid-latitude magnetograms to improve its intensity estimate.
