Absorbing UV radiation, ozone protects life on Earth and plays a fundamental role in Earth’s
temperature balance. The formation of ozone occurs through the ternary recombination reaction:
O2 + O + M →O3 + M, where M can be N2, O2 or Ar. Here, we developed a theoretical approach
capable of modeling the formation of ozone molecules in ternary collisions, and applied it to the
reaction with M=Ar because of extensive experimental data available. The rate coeﬃcients for
the direct formation of O3 in ternary collisions O+O2+Ar were computed for the ﬁrst time as
a function of collision energy, and thermally-averaged coeﬃcients were derived for temperatures
5-900 K leading to a good agreement with available experimental data for temperatures 100-900 K.
The present study shows that the formation of ozone in ternary collisions O+O2+Ar at temperatures
below 200 K proceeds through a formation of a temporary complex ArO2, while at temperatures
above 1000 K, the reaction proceeds mainly through a formation of long-lived vibrational resonances
of O∗
3. At intermediate temperatures 200 K-1000 K, the process cannot be viewed as a two-step
mechanism. In addition, it is found that the majority of O3 molecules formed initially are weakly
bound.

INTRODUCTION

Being the major absorber of the UV light in the upper
atmosphere [1], the ozone molecule is crucial for the well-
being of humanity. However, the tropospheric ozone, the
concentration of which near the Earth’s surface was dou-
bled or tripled in the troposphere during XX century [2]
is harmful to the human respiratory system and, there-
fore, is considered as an air pollutant. Therefore, from an
ecological point of view, ozone should be protected from
destruction in the upper atmosphere, but its production
in living or workspaces must be minimized. Furthermore,
the O3/O2 photochemical cycle has a signiﬁcant impact
on the chemistry in the Earth’s atmosphere and climate
change [3].

In Earth’s ionosphere,

formation of ozone occurs
through the reaction of ternary recombination: O2 + O
+ M →O3 + M, where M is typically N2, O2. Knowledge
of the “nascent population” of ozone is essential for reli-
able modeling of the satellite measurements in nonlocal
thermodynamic conditions of the upper atmosphere [4–
6]. In many laboratory experiments [7–10] it was shown
that the ternary rate coeﬃcient k3 for M=N2 have a very
similar behavior as those of M=Ar. A complete database
is available [9] for the argon colliding partner, which is
thus often used to study ozone formation.

In the existing literature, two simpliﬁed mechanisms
were proposed to analyze the process. Both mechanisms
proceed in two steps forming an intermediate complex:
stabilization and Chaperon mechanisms. In the stabiliza-
tion mechanism (also known as energy transfer mecha-
nism), the complex is a long-lived rovibrational resonance

O∗
3 of ozone, whereas, in the Chaperon mechanism, the
complex is a resonance of O2M∗. The relative importance
of the two mechanisms in ozone formation at particular
conditions is determined by (a) lifetimes and densities of
resonances in the energy interval corresponding to col-
lision energies and (b) partial pressures of O, O2, and
M. It is important to stress that the rate coeﬃcient for
the ternary recombination, properly determined theoret-
ically or, in an ideal world, experimentally, accounts for
both (and any other) two-step mechanisms. Therefore,
the ternary recombination rate coeﬃcient can be used
to analyze the importance of one of the two-step mecha-
nisms at given densities.

All previous theoretical studies of ternary recombina-
tion of ozone have implied one or two two-step mecha-
nisms for ozone formation. The novelty of the present
work is that it aims at obtaining the rate coeﬃcient con-
sidering the ternary collision O2 + O + M without split-
ting the process into two steps. The present theoretical
approach combines an ab initio potential energy surfaces
(PES) of the ArO3 system, obtained in this study, and
the classical-trajectory method in hyperspherical coordi-
nates developed previously by two of us et al. [11–13].

RESULTS

ArO3 potential. The potential energy surface (PES)
used in this study is constructed as the sum V = VO−O2 +
VAr−O2 + VAr−O. VO−O2 is the intramolecular ab ini-
tio potential energy surface (PES) of ozone [14]. The
high accuracy of the PES was conﬁrmed by the study of

the angle between the plane of O+O2 and the direction
to Ar, so to simplify the numerical part of the approach,
the angle is ﬁxed to 0. Finally, the angle α between O2
and Ar is considered a parameter of the problem; Calcu-
lations are made for several values of α and the result is
averaged over that parameter (see the Methods for de-
tails).

The application of this method to the formation of
ozone via ternary recombination reaction O2 + O + Ar →
O3 + Ar is based on the assumption that the inter-
nal degrees of freedom of the oxygen molecule do not
play an essential role since the excitation of the O2 vi-
brational mode requires high collision energy, i.e., over
1000 cm−1(≈ 1439 K). The assumption can be veriﬁed
calculating rate coeﬃcients for diﬀerent bond angles of
the ArO2 molecule, α. As a result, we are able to esti-
mate the uncertainty of the present calculations due to
the approximation of the frozen internal degrees of free-
dom of the oxygen molecule (see the Methods for details).
Finally, the thermal average of the three-body recom-
bination rate coeﬃcient is obtained by integrating the
energy-dependent three-body recombination rate coeﬃ-
cient, k3(Ec), over the appropriate three-body Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution of collision energies, Ec, yielding

Dynamics. Rigorous full quantum scattering calcula-
tions for the system are considered as practically unfea-
sible [20, 21]. Various classical calculations [22, 23], –
statistical [24] or ad hoc simpliﬁed quantum models and
essentially focused on one of the two-step mechanisms,–
have been reported [25–28], but a qualitative agreement
is still lacking, as reviewed in Refs. [20, 21].

The present approach is based on a classical trajec-
tory (CT) method in hyperspherical coordinates, which
has shown eﬃciency for reactive collisions of three neu-
tral atoms [11–13, 29] as well as for ion-neutral-neutral
ternary recombination processes [30–32]. The method
is adapted to the present problem representing the O2
molecule as a super-atom. Thus, reducing the degrees of
freedom of the O+O2+Ar system. In calculations, it re-
sults in a ﬁxed angle between O2 and the direction to O,
corresponding to the bond angle in O3 (117◦). The in-
teraction of Ar with O3 does not depend signiﬁcantly on

ergy obtained for diﬀerent values of angle α between
O2 and the direction to Ar. Comparing the upper set
of data (indicated by circles), which is associated with
the ozone molecules of all binding energies, and the
lower set (squares), i.e., the formation rates of “deeply-
bound” levels of O3 with binding energies larger than
200 cm−1 (≈ 288 K), one can conclude that the majority
of molecules formed through ternary recombination are
highly-excited. Such molecules can be destroyed or sta-
bilized in collisions with other species present in the gas.
The cross sections for the two processes are comparable.
The radiative stabilization is negligible because of the
very long radiative lifetimes of these states. Therefore,
comparing with an experiment at 300 K, in which only
deeply-bound or stabilized O3 molecules are accounted
for, one should consider the lower set of data.

Figure 3 gives thermally-averaged rate coeﬃcients
k3(T ) for molecules with all binding energies and for
those with binding energies larger than 50 cm−1 (≈ 72 K)
and 200 cm−1 (≈ 288 K) and compares them with avail-
able experimental data. Clearly, the theoretical co-
eﬃcients have diﬀerent T -dependence due to the fact
that in an experiment at a given temperature T , only
the molecules with binding energies larger than T are
collisionally stabilized and accounted for.
Indeed, the
theoretical data for molecules with binding energies
>50 cm−1 and >200 cm−1 agree with the experimental
data at 72 K and 288 K within about 50%.

DISCUSSION

To compare the obtained theoretical results with the
experimental data more accurately, one would have to ac-
count for processes taking place in the experiment once
the ternary recombination forms an initial distribution
over vibrational levels of O3, the nascent population. The
leading process is the vibrational de-excitation of highly-
excited O3 molecules in collisions with other species (vi-
brational quenching). A detailed study of vibrational
quenching is underway but beyond the scope of this work.
Here, we will account for the process using a statistical
factor ∆E/T , suggested [9, 44] for the stabilization pro-
cess, which is the same as the vibrational quenching of
highly-excited O3. The averaged value ∆E of energy
transfer during the stabilization is of the order of the en-
ergy of Ar-O3 interaction averaged over involved vibra-
tional states of O3, which is about 50 K (see the Ar-O and
Ar-O2 curves in Fig. 1). Therefore, we use ∆E = 50 K.
The resulting rate coeﬃcient, accounting for the vibra-
tional quenching, is shown in Fig. 4. As one can see, the
agreement with the experimental data is remarkable for
temperatures above 70 K. The good agreement indicates
that despite several approximations made in the model,
the main physics of the process is accounted for correctly.

nisms. The present results allow us to analyze which of
the two-step models (stabilization or Chaperon) is domi-
nant. Figure 5 gives the rate coeﬃcients for the formation
of all three possible products of the reaction, O3, ArO2,
and ArO. The ﬁgure demonstrates two distinct charac-
teristics: First, at low collision energies (Ec (cid:46) 130 K)
[13, 29], ArO2 is formed more quickly than ArO, which
is formed more quickly than O3 (assuming equal densities
of Ar, O, and O2). The result is explained by the fact
that the attractive potential of the Ar-O2 system decays
slower than that of Ar-O, so that it has a larger density of
available vibrational states to be formed (a larger phase-
space volume in the classical formulation of the problem).
The same argument applies to the comparison between
the O-O2 and Ar-O potentials.

The second distinct feature in Fig. 5 is the change in
the power-law behavior of recombination rates at 200-
300 K. The ﬁrst sudden drop appears in k3 of ArO around
its dissociation energy: At collision energies larger than
the dissociation energy, fewer ArO molecules are formed
due to higher initial velocities. The rates of formation
of ozone and ArO2 are also aﬀected in a similar way,
although in these cases, slopes of the coeﬃcients vary
much less than that for ArO. There is another drop in
the recombination rates of all products when the colli-
sion energy surpasses the dissociation energy of ArO2.
Interestingly, there is another smoother change in the
slope of the rate coeﬃcient for O3 formation that may
be due to the shoulder structure on O3 [14, 45], visible
in Fig. 1. The overall eﬀect is that for collision energies
(cid:38) 150 K, the probability of forming bound levels of ArO
decreases signiﬁcantly (compared with other products),
and the probability of ozone formation overcomes it.

The more signiﬁcant rate coeﬃcients for the formation
of ArO2 and ArO compared to O3 at low collision energies
mean that the Chaperon mechanism is more important
than the stabilization at temperatures (cid:46) 100 K. At higher
temperatures, the probability of forming weakly bound
ozone molecules is more prominent than for ArO, and
hence the stabilization mechanism starts to play a role.
Similarly, at temperatures above 1000 K, typical colli-
sion energies are larger than binding energies of ArO2
and ArO, so that formation of the corresponding bound
molecules is less likely, and the stabilization mechanism
becomes dominant.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We would like to stress the following ﬁndings of the

present study.

1. The rate coeﬃcients for the formation of O3
in ternary collisions O+O2+Ar, without using
any two-steps approximation, were computed for

the ﬁrst time as a function of collision energies.
Thermally-averaged coeﬃcients were derived for
temperatures 5-900 K.

2. Due to a relatively long observation time in exper-
iments that were performed so far, a direct mea-
surement of the ternary rate coeﬃcient was not
possible since the majority of O3 molecules formed
initially, the nascent population, are weakly-bound
and, therefore, destroyed or stabilized in collisions
with other species present in the gas (Ar, O2, etc.)
that aﬀected the observation results.

3. Accounting for the process of vibrational quench-
ing of the nascent population using the statistical
formula by Troe [44], an excellent agreement with
available experimental data for temperatures 100-
900 K is obtained. At temperatures 50-100 K the-
ory gives smaller rate coeﬃcients. It is likely that
the classical-trajectory approach is not applicable
for these temperatures because at the correspond-
ing collision energies, details of the resonant struc-
ture of O3 and, possibly, ArO2 metastable rovibra-
tional states could be important, which cannot be
treated accurately using classical-trajectory meth-
ods.

4. The rate coeﬃcients obtained in an explicitly three-
body approach, without assuming any two-step
mechanism, allowed us to conclude that the Chap-
eron mechanism in ozone formalism is dominant
at temperatures below 100 K, while the energy-
transfer stabilization mechanism appears to be
dominant above 1000 K.

ArO3 PES. The Ar-O2 and Ar-O intermolecular PESs
were constructed using the unrestricted version of the
explicitly-correlated single- and double-excitation cou-
pled cluster method with a perturbative treatment of
triple excitations [UCCSD(T)-F12a] with the augmented
correlation-consistent triple-zeta aug-cc-pVTZ basis set.
The ﬁnal root mean square error of the ﬁt of the ab ini-
tio data was within 1 cm−1 at all energies in the PES
potential wells.

Dynamics. Reduced to three-body problem, the sys-
tem is described by six-dimensional (6D) hyperspherical
coordinates. The initial angular dependence, which de-
pends on both direction and magnitude of impact param-
eter (cid:126)b and initial momentum (cid:126)P0 vectors, has been aver-
aged out by means of the Monte Carlo method. The ini-
tial hyperangles determining the orientation of these vec-
tors in the 6D space are sampled randomly from probabil-
ity distribution functions associated with the appropriate
angular elements in hyperspherical coordinates (see, e.g.,
Refs. [11, 46]). For the results reported in this work,
1.3 × 109 random initial conﬁgurations of ((cid:126)b, (cid:126)P0) pairs
has been sampled.

To solve the Hamilton’s equations we made use of the
variable-step, variable-order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton
method of order 1 to 13, which is based on a multi-step
predictor–corrector algorithm [47–49]. The acceptable
error for each time-step has been determined by abso-
lute and relative tolerances equal to 10−15 and 10−11,
respectively. The total energy is conserved during colli-
sions to, at least, three signiﬁcant digits and the mag-
nitude of total angular momentum vector is conserved
to at least six signiﬁcant digits. The initial magnitude
of hyper-radius is generated randomly from the interval
[R0 − 20a0, R0 + 20a0] centered around R0 = 200 a0.
This value fulﬁlls the condition for three particles to be
initially in an uniform rectilinear state of motion.

Evaluation of the conﬁdence interval. To calculate the
conﬁdence interval we considered both the statistical er-
ror, owing the inherent stochastic nature of the Monte
Carlo technique, and the error due to diﬀerent α angles.
The latter one has been implemented as the standard de-
viation of the results obtained by using α = π/2, from
the weighted average over diﬀerent angles, i.e.,
