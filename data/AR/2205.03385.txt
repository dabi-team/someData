ABSTRACT

In recent decades our understanding of solar active regions (ARs) has improved substantially
due to observations made with better angular resolution and wider spectral coverage. While prior
AR observations have shown that these structures were always brighter than the quiet Sun at
centimeter wavelengths, recent observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths have
shown ARs with well deﬁned dark umbrae. Given this new information, it is now necessary
to update our understanding and models of the solar atmosphere in active regions. In this
work, we present a data-constrained model of the AR solar atmosphere,
in which we use
brightness temperature measurements of NOAA 12470 at three radio frequencies: 17, 100
and 230 GHz. The observations at 17 GHz were made by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph
(NoRH), while the observations at 100 and 230 GHz were obtained by the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Based on our model, which assumes that the radio

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
Oliveira e Silva et al.

emission originates from thermal free-free and gyroresonance processes, we calculate radio
brightness temperature maps that can be compared with the observations. The magnetic ﬁeld
at distinct atmospheric heights was determined in our modelling process by force-free ﬁeld
extrapolation using photospheric magnetograms taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). In order to determine the best plasma
temperature and density height proﬁles necessary to match the observations, the model uses
a genetic algorithm that modiﬁes a standard quiet Sun atmospheric model. Our results show
that the height of the transition region (TR) of the modelled atmosphere varies with the type of
region being modelled: for umbrae the TR is located at 1080 ± 20 km above the solar surface;
for penumbrae, the TR is located at 1800 ± 50 km; and for bright regions outside sunspots, the
TR is located at 2000 ± 100 km. With these results, we ﬁnd good agreement with the observed
AR brightness temperature maps. Our modelled AR can be used to estimate the emission at
frequencies without observational coverage.

1 INTRODUCTION

Numerous semi-empirical models of the solar atmosphere are intended to reproduce solar active region
(AR) observations with success in a speciﬁc wavelength range. Most of these efforts have been based
on optical and UV line observations (e.g.: Vernazza et al., 1981; Fontenla et al., 1993, 1999, 2009) and
have had success modelling the observations at these wavelengths. Nevertheless, these models are less
successful in reproducing radio observations of ARs, perhaps due to the presence of distinct emission
mechanisms at radio wavelengths and the lack of comparable spatial resolution.

In the last decades our knowledge of solar active regions has improved substantially due to observations
made with better angular resolution. Recent observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths
have shown ARs with well deﬁned dark umbrae (Loukitcheva et al., 2014; Iwai and Shimojo, 2015;
Shimojo et al., 2017). Moreover, Iwai et al. (2016) suggested that even at radio frequencies as low as
34 GHz the observed brightness temperature ( Tb) of the umbral region is almost the same as that of the
quiet region, which indicates that the height (and therefore temperature) in the atmosphere at which its
emission becomes optically thick should be lower than that predicted by the models.

Great advances in the understanding of AR behavior have been acquired with the daily NoRH
(Nakajima et al., 1994) observations at 17 GHz since 1992, and also 34 GHz after 1996. Vourlidas et al.
(2006) studied 529 ARs observed by the NoRH at 17 GHz (1992–1994), and concluded that the ARs with
polarization greater than 30% contain a gyroresonance core that increases their brightness temperatures to
Tb & 105 K, well above the quiet Sun brightness temperature ( Tb,QS) of 10000 K at 17 GHz. Moreover,
they also argued that these high Tb values were due to opacity at the gyroresonance 3rd harmonic,
requiring 2000 G of magnetic ﬁeld intensity (| ~B|) in the corona, and therefore at least | ~B| = 2200 G
at the photospheric level.

At submillimeter wavelenghts, Silva et al. (2005) analyzed a total of 23 ARs observed during 2002 at
212 and 405 GHz from the Submillimeter Solar Telescope (SST, Kaufmann et al., 2008) and combined
with maps at 17 and 34 GHz from NoRH. The ﬂux density spectra at these frequencies was found to
increase with frequency with a slope of 2, indicating that the emission from these active regions is
predominantly due to thermal bremsstrahlung. Moreover, Valle Silva et al. (2021) made a similar analyses
with the inclusion of the ALMA single-dish data reaching the same conclusions.

Further advances in the study of ARs became possible in 2016, with the start of ALMA observations
at millimeter/submillimeter wavelengths (Wedemeyer et al., 2016). During the Science Veriﬁcation
period, 2015 December 16–20, AR 12470, including a sunspot umbra, was observed by the ALMA
interferometric array at Band 3 (84–116 GHz) and Band 6 (211–275 GHz). Whereas the sunspot umbra
exhibited a continuous dark region at Band 6 (Shimojo et al., 2017), at Band 3 the center of the umbra
showed a bright structure with Tb 800 K above the dark region around it (Iwai et al., 2017). This Band 3
brightness enhancement may be an intrinsic feature of the sunspot umbra at chromospheric heights, such
as a manifestation of umbral ﬂashes, or it could be related to a coronal plume.

Selhorst et al. (2008) were able to reproduce the brightness temperatures and the spatial structure of AR
NOAA 10008 seen in NoRH observations at 17 and 34 GHz. That work used photospheric magnetic ﬁeld
extrapolation to derive ~B in the atmosphere1 and suggested that the AR chromospheric temperature and
density gradients were steeper than those proposed for the quiet Sun. Also, the temperature and density
in the corona needed to be greater than expected in the quiet Sun, as expected. With these assumptions,
the model was able to reproduce the high Tb observed in the 17 GHz gyroresonance core, and also the
free-free emission observed in non-polarized areas at both 17 and 34 GHz.

Brajˇsa et al. (2009) studied active regions observed at 37 GHz with the 14-m antenna of the Mets¨ahovi
Radio Observatory and compared the measured intensities with radiation models. They concluded that
thermal bremsstrahlung can explain the observed radiation of ARs, while thermal gyromagnetic emission
can, with high probability, be excluded as a possible radiation mechanism at the frequency considered (37
GHz). Further, Brajˇsa et al. (2018) compared intensities measured in full-disc solar ALMA maps taken
at 248 GHz with model-based prediction of the brightness temperatures. Again, they concluded that the
thermal bremsstrahlung is the main radiation mechanism responsible for the AR emission, also at this
observing frequency (248 GHz).

As an improvement of the AR modelling presented in Selhorst et al. (2008, 2009), in this work we
apply a genetic algorithm (GA; Charbonneau, 1995) to modify a standard quiet Sun atmospheric model
in order to determine the best plasma temperature and density height proﬁles necessary to match the
observations of NOAA 12470 obtained by ALMA (single-dish maps at 100 and 230 GHz) and NoRH
(17 GHz interferometric map).

Finally, we note that Brajˇsa et al. (2020) performed a preliminary analysis of the magnetic structure
above the same AR 12470 using LOS photospheric magnetograms and a potential-ﬁeld source surface
(PFSS) model to extrapolate magnetic ﬁelds into the solar chromosphere and corona. Results of the model
were compared with the ALMA single-dish (248 GHz) and interferometric (100 GHz) measurements of
the same AR. The general extrapolated magnetic structure is consistent with the ALMA observations, but
a detailed analysis and comparison with ALMA small-scale features was not possible with the model used
and requires a more detailed magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation model, what is performed in the present work.

2 ATMOSPHERIC MODELLING VIA GENETIC ALGORITHM

The purpose of this study is to estimate the temperature and electron density as a function of height in the
solar atmosphere, as constrained by brightness temperature Tb maps of radio observations. The different
frequencies provide access to different layers of the atmosphere due to the frequency dependence of
opacity. An initial 1D atmospheric model is used as a seed for the GA: at each step, Tb is obtained

via the calculation of radiative transfer incorporating opacity from both the thermal bremsstrahlung and
gyroresonance emission mechanisms. For these calculation, the 3D magnetic ﬁeld structure above the
AR is derived from linear force-free extrapolations (LFF) from photospheric magnetograms. The GA
iteratively updates the atmospheric plasma trapped by magnetic ﬁeld lines until a best model is found via
χ2 minimization of the calculated and observed Tb values. This process is run independently for each
pixel of the observed radio maps, resulting in an atmospheric model (T and n versus height) for each line
of sight. Together, the results for all pixels provide the 3D atmospheric model for the active region.

2.1 Genetic Algorithm Features

In order to determine the best plasma temperature and density height proﬁles necessary to match the

observations, we employ the genetic algorithm Pikaia (Charbonneau, 1995).

The atmospheric model developed by Selhorst et al. (2005b, hereafter SSC) is used as the seed in the
genetic algorithm, that changes the seed model to ﬁnd the best ﬁt for the observational measurements.
Five free parameters are supplied to the GA representing the atmospheric model. These parameters are
based on the ideas presented in Selhorst et al. (2008), as follows:

• ∇T – changes the AR temperature gradient in the chromosphere;
• ∇ne – changes the AR electron density gradient in the chromosphere;
• NT – changes the AR coronal temperature by a constant value, in which NT = TAR
TqS
• Nne – changes the AR coronal electron density by a constant value, in which Nne =

;

neAR
neqS

;

• ∆h – changes the TR position.

These ﬁve free parameters combined build new electron density and temperature proﬁles, which are
used, along with the magnetic ﬁeld values for the line-of-sight column, to calculate the bremsstrahlung
and gyroresonance absorption coefﬁcients. The radiative transfer is then performed and the resulting Tb
values are compared with the observations. Nevertheless, the GA used here is a mathematical solution and
it does not verify if the atmospheric plasma is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or not.

A generation of child atmospheric models is created by the algorithm based on the parent models with
the lowest χ2 values, using the genetic algorithm described in Charbonneau (1995). The GA starts with the
choice of minimum and maximum values for each one of the ﬁve free parameters. The method used here
was full-generation replacement using ten generations with one hundred children each. The crossover
probability was 0.85 and the mutation mode was variable. The initial mutation rate, that is, the initial
probability that any gene locus will mutate in any generation, was 0.005. Finally, the mutation rate range
was between 0.0005 and 0.25. In our runs the χ2 measure typically stabilizes to a minimum value by about
the seventh generation.

2.2 Magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation

Photospheric magnetograms are used as the boundary condition for an extrapolation of the ﬁeld above
the photosphere using the linear force-free ﬁeld approximation. The fundamental equation that describes
a force-free ﬁeld (assuming that the current density is parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld at any point in space)
is

Oliveira e Silva et al.

~∇ × ~B = α ~B

(1)

where α is a proportionality function and represents the current density distribution, called a force-free
function.

The extrapolation routine is based on the works of Nakagawa and Raadu (1972) and Seehafer (1978)
and was previously implemented in IDL by J. E. R. Costa and T. S. N. Pinto (used in Selhorst et al.,
2005a, 2008; Nita et al., 2018). The calculation starts from the line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld component at
the photosphere and determines the magnetic ﬁeld above it for both the potential ﬁeld (α = 0) and the
force-free ﬁeld (α 6= 0). The result is three cubes of intensities, one for each component of the magnetic
ﬁeld vector (Bx, By, and Bz) and another data cube for the positions of the magnetic ﬁeld lines. The
positions of the magnetic ﬁeld lines determine where the atmospheric plasma is changed with respect to
the quiet Sun. Moreover, the x and y dimensions of the cubes have the same dimensions as the selected
active region area. In this work, the extrapolated ﬁeld lines were calculated only above positions with
| ~B|min = 200 G at the photosphere. A different minimum value could be chosen by the user, but we
found that the inclusion of magnetic ﬁelds below this limit resulted in the simulated ARs appearing much
larger than the observed ARs. This approach in effect determines one parameter, i.e., the lower limit of
the ﬁeld strength needed to best reproduce the observations.

2.3 Emission mechanisms

The brightness temperature Tb is obtained by computing the radiative transfer along the line of sight
for each column of the AR. At radio frequencies, in the quiescent solar atmosphere, the main emission
mechanisms are bremsstrahlung and gyroresonance (Dulk, 1985). The thermal bremsstrahlung absorption
coefﬁcient (κb) is calculated by

(2)

where ν is the observed frequency (Hz), T is the plasma temperature and ne is the electron density. Only
the contributions of collisions with protons was considered, since its density is much larger than that of
other ion species (ni).

Following Zirin (1988), it was assumed Z = 1.178, if a fully hydrogen atmosphere was considered, i.e.

Z = 1, the resulting Tb should be only ∼ 3% smaller for all frequencies simulated here.

The Gaunt factor (g(T,ν)) used is as follow:

g(T, ν) =

18.2 + ln T 3/2 − ln ν
24.5 + ln T − ln ν

(T < 2 × 105 K)

Since the contribution of higher harmonics to the radio emission is very small (Shibasaki et al., 1994),

the gyroresonance emission was only calculated for harmonics smaller than 5 (s ≤ 5).

Following Zirin (1988), radiative transfer yields the brightness temperature as a function of wavelength

3 OBSERVATIONS

In this work, we selected the active region AR NOAA 12470 to test our algorithm. This region was
selected due to the availability of radio observations at three frequencies: 17 GHz, from the Nobeyama
Radio Heliograph (NoRH), 100 and 230 GHz from the Atacama Large Millimetric and submillimetric
Array (ALMA) (Shimojo et al., 2017; Valle Silva et al., 2021).

Here, the LFF extrapolations algorithm used the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetogram obtained by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Schou et al., 2012) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO,
Pesnell et al., 2012), nevertheless, the LFF extrapolations could also be applied to vector magnetograms.
HMI operates at wavelengths around 6173 ˚A(Fe I) and provides LOS magnetograms of 4096×4096 pixels
with ∼ 0.5 arcsec spatial resolution.

3.1 Magnetogram

Figure 1 (left panel) shows the HMI line of sight (LOS) magnetogram obtained on December 17, 2015
at 14:51 UT. This full Sun image has an apparent radius of 975” and magnetic ﬁeld intensities (| ~B|) up
to 2300 G. The active region is shown in detail in Figure 1, right panel, centered in the point of greatest
magnetic ﬁeld intensity (| ~B|max). The selected area included the whole AR NOAA 12470, and also part
of the AR NOAA 12469 located to the northwest of the central umbra.

Figure 1. The left image shows the SDO/HMI LOS magnetogram obtained on 2015 Dec 17 at 14:51 UT.
The blue rectangle indicates the selected area of active region AR12470, shown in expanded form in the
right panel. The region shown is 516.4′′ × 516.4′′, centered at 17.40◦N,17.68◦E.

The line-of-sight magnetogram will underestimate ﬁeld strengths in AR 12470 due to projection effects,
since the region is signiﬁcantly offset from disk center. To correct for this, the AR has been rotated to
solar disk center, solar spherical curvature has been removed, and the magnetic ﬁeld intensities have been
corrected for projection. This increases the maximum ﬁeld strength from 2300 G to ∼ 2500 G.

3.2 Radio maps

The ALMA maps used here were obtained during the Science Veriﬁcation period, 2015 December 16–20
2. The maps were obtained by the fast-scan single-dish method described in White et al. (2017), at Band
3 (84–116 GHz) and Band 6 (211–275 GHz). Following Selhorst et al. (2019), we took 100 and 230 GHz
as the reference frequencies for Bands 3 and 6, respectively. The maps were made from observations of
a 12m diameter antenna, resulting in nominal spatial resolutions of 25” and 58” at 230 and 100 GHz,
respectively.

Since the radio maps were not obtained at the same time as the magnetogram, it was necessary to take
into account solar rotation when aligning the radio data with the magnetogram. The nominal time of the
230 GHz map is 14:52 UT, i.e., only 1 minute difference from the nominal time of the HMI observation,
requiring just −0.01◦ of longitudinal rotation. The nominal time of the 100 GHz map was 19:35 UT,
requiring a longitudinal rotation of −2.85◦. Moreover, the ALMA maps come in distinct sizes, 800 × 800
pixels2 (3” pixel) at 230 GHz and 400 × 400 pixels2 (6” pixel) at 100 GHz. Thus for a better comparison
with the model results they were resized to match the HMI magnetogram (4096 × 4096 pixels2).

While the quiet Sun brightness temperature ( Tb,QS) at 230 GHz is 6210 ± 110 K (Selhorst et al., 2019),
the AR 12470 brightness temperature (Tb) varies from 5800 to 6600 K across locations with magnetic ﬁeld
intensities greater than 1500 G, i.e., the minimum intensity to form a sunspot (Livingston et al., 2012). At
100 GHz, TqS = 7110 ± 90 K (Selhorst et al., 2019) and AR 12470 showed Tb varying from 7200 to
7650 K where | ~B| > 1500 G.

17 GHz. The blue rectangle in each panel indicates the selected area of the active region AR12470, taking
into account solar rotation given timing differences relative to the HMI magnetogram.

We also used 17 GHz radio maps obtained routinely by NoRH with resolution of 10-18 arcsec in
intensity and circular polarization (Nakajima et al., 1994) and intensity maps at 34 GHz with 5-10” spatial
resolution (Takano et al., 1997). We used a 17 GHz map observed at 02:44 UT and available in 512 × 512
pixels2 format (4.91” resolution), rotated longitudinally by 7.31◦ with respect to the HMI magnetogram.
At 17 GHz, TqS = 10050 ± 120 K, and AR 12470 has brightness temperatures varying from 5.3 × 104
to 6.8 × 104 K in the areas with | ~B| > 1500 G. Figure 2 shows the ALMA single dish maps obtained at
230 GHz and 100 GHz, plus the NoRH map at 17 GHz. In contrast to the small levels of variability in
the ALMA maps, at 17 GHz the active region Tb reached values almost 7 times the level of the quiet Sun.
The bright compact source in the active region has a high polarization degree (∼ 100%) indicating the
presence of a gyroresonance core (Vourlidas et al., 2006; Selhorst et al., 2008) which is coincident with
the sunspot umbra.

4 RESULTS

A low value for the α parameter in (1) does not signiﬁcantly affect the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld
conﬁguration at low heights in the atmosphere: here α = −0.005 was chosen for the LFF extrapolation
since it generated a greater number of closed magnetic ﬁeld lines in the selected region than did the
potential-ﬁeld extrapolation (α = 0). Figure 3 shows some of the magnetic ﬁeld lines obtained in the
extrapolation with α = −0.005 and | ~B|min = 200 G.

To speed up the computational process, the datacubes and images were resized from 1024×1024 pixels2
to 256 × 256 pixels2, corresponding to a spatial resolution ∼ 2′′ per pixel. However, the radiative transfer
calculations require better resolution in the height of the voxels (hz) due to the relatively narrow width of
the chromosphere, and they were re-scaled via interpolation from the resolution of the magnetogram to
50 km, similar to the resolution of the SSC model.

The GA optimizes the electron density and temperature proﬁles for each vertical column in the model
cube by comparing the brightness temperatures obtained from the model with the observed maps, pixel by
pixel. This procedure initially generated ∼28 thousand different atmosphere proﬁles. These proﬁles were
reﬁned, in order to reduce the χ2 between observed Tb values and those obtained from the model. The
ﬁnal model is obtained when the χ2 from the GA process ceases to reduce further.

This is a provisional ﬁle, not the ﬁnal typeset article

Figure 3. Magnetic ﬁeld lines obtained in a linear force-free extrapolation of the AR 12470 magnetogram,
for | ~B|min = 200 G and α = −0.005.

The resulting atmospheric proﬁles were grouped into four different classes corresponding to different
atmospheric features: umbrae, penumbrae, plage and quiet Sun. To speed up the GA process, distinct
initial seeds were used for each class. Each pixel in the magnetogram was classiﬁed as umbra, penumbra,
or plage according to its intensity (| ~B|), as follows: umbra, | ~B| ≥ 1500 G (∼ 200 pixels); penumbra,
1000 ≤ | ~B0| < 1500 G (∼230 pixels); plages, 200 ≤ | ~B0| < 1000 G (∼27200 pixels). All pixels with
| ~B| ≤ 200 G were classiﬁed as quiet Sun (∼38000 pixels) and were assumed to have TB = TqS. We
then obtained the average electron density and temperature proﬁles for each of the three AR classes by
calculating the average of the proﬁles with the lowest χ2 values in the Tb calculation, in relation to the
observed values at the three distinct observing frequencies. These resulting models are shown in Figure 4
along with the the SSC quiet sun, for comparison.

The | ~B| limits used to classify each pixel are based on studies by Livingston et al. (2012), who derived
a minimum necessary value of 1500 G for sunspot formation. Moreover, the umbra is a compact source
with a diameter ∼ 25′′ in its largest part. In Nita et al. (2018), the authors proposed a similar separation,
however, in that work the separation was based on solar white light images instead of a magnetogram,
which is not useful for faint or spotless ARs.

In the Table 1 we present the average height of the transition region (TR), which is one of the ﬁve free
parameters ﬁtted in the GA process, for each atmospheric class: thus, 1080±20 km above the solar surface
for umbrae, 1800±50 km for penumbrae, and 2000±100 km for plages.

4.1 Free-free contribution

The GA is able to derive appropriate ﬁts for the assumed basic structure of the solar atmosphere, i.e.,
ﬁtting for the 5 free parameters yields satisfactory models. Although, the SSC model considers the plasma
fully ionized above 1000 km, i.e. ne = ni, to simplify the GA the densities were grouped in a single
variable, that is (ne × ni)1/2. This variable was assumed as the density in Table 2 and Figure 4. Table 2
shows the variation of temperature and density as function of height for the distinct AR areas, moreover,

Comparison with the quiet-Sun model indicates that the umbrae, penumbrae and plages have a narrower
temperature-minimum region and a thinner chromosphere than the quiet Sun, as can be seen in Table 2
and Figure 4. Moreover, the compression of the temperature minimum and the chromosphere are most
pronounced in umbral pixels, i.e. the region with more intense magnetic ﬁelds (Figure 4). The mean
umbral model placed the transition region close to 1000 km above the solar surface, in agreement with
previous work (e.g., Fontenla et al., 1999, 2009; Selhorst et al., 2008; Nita et al., 2018, see also Zlotnik
et al., 1996). Furthermore, the umbral region is the only one that presents a signiﬁcant increase in the
coronal temperature, which is necessary to reach the high Tb values observed in the gyroresonance source
at 17 GHz (Selhorst et al., 2008, 2009).

In Figure 5 we show, for each atmospheric class, the optical depth (τ , top row) and the contribution
function (CF, bottom row), that represents the emission variation with the atmosphere height. The CF is
deﬁned as

CF(h) = jνe

−τν

(6)

where jν = κνBν(T ) is the emission coefﬁcient, and Bν(T ) is the Planck function. Following
Tapia-V´azquez and De la Luz (2020), each CF shown in Figure 4 was normalized by its maximum, for a
better comparison of the formation height of the emission at each frequency.

Figure 5. Top: the panels show the optical depth (τ ) variation with the height above the solar surface
for the following areas: quiet Sun, plage, penumbra and umbra. The horizontal dotted line represents the
τ = 1 height. Bottom: the variation of the contribution function (CF) with the height above the solar
surface. Each CF was normalized by its maximum for a better comparison of the formation height of the
emission at each frequency.

As previously reported by Selhorst et al. (2019),

the quiet Sun free-free emission at 230 GHz is
formed mainly in two different layers: near the temperature-minimum region (h ∼ 400 km), and in the
chromosphere, with a peak around 900 km. Moreover, the contraction of the atmosphere does not change
the CF double-peak structure, rather it just changes the heights of the two peaks and their contribution
percentages (see red curves in Figure 5). On the other hand, the quiet Sun free-free emission at 100 and
17 GHz are completely formed in the chromosphere, with CF peaks, respectively, at 1650 and 2900 Km.
These heights of the maximum of the CF are close to the atmosphere height at which τ = 1, as expected.
Moreover, the atmospheric reduction of the AR active areas only moves the CF peaks closer to the solar
surface. However, the 17 GHz τ results (orange curves) in the umbral region showed a huge change in
the TR structure that cannot be attributed to free-free opacity and will be discussed in detail in the next
section (4.2). The chromospheric free-free contribution is still present at 17 GHz, but its CF peak is only
5% of the TR peak (see the small orange peak close to 800 km).

4.2 Gyroresonance contribution

Several studies (e.g. Shibasaki et al., 1994; White and Kundu, 1997; Kundu et al., 2001; Vourlidas et al.,
2006) have established that the gyroresonance radio emission is produced by opacity in harmonics 2,
3 and 4 of the electron cyclotron frequency, necessarily at TR or coronal heights in order to produce
the brightness temperatures in excess of 105 K observed at 17 GHz. Moreover, Vourlidas et al. (2006)
suggested that ARs with high polarization (& 30%) at 17 GHz have gyroresonance cores, and that | ~B| =
2200 G is the minimum intensity to generate such a core. AR 12470 presented a component with high
polarization degree (up to 94%) and | ~B| ∼ 2500 G that is likely to be due to a gyroresonance source.

To investigate the gyroresonance contribution, κg was calculated for harmonics s ≤ 5, allowing for
an uncertainty of 10% in the | ~B| values. That is, the 3rd harmonic was calculated where the magnetic
ﬁeld model showed intensities of | ~B| ≃ 2000 ± 200 G, the 4th harmonic was calculated where | ~B| ≃

1500 ± 150 G, and the 5th harmonic where | ~B| ≃ 1200 ± 120 G. Due to the heliographic position of AR
12740 (17.40◦N, 17.68◦E), it is estimated that | ~B| is 7.5% greater than the observed Bz.

Figure 6a shows the variation in the absorption coefﬁcient κν with height along the line-of-sight to the
location of maximum brightness temperature in AR 12470. The blue curve represents the magnetic ﬁeld
variation with height. The continuous black curve shows the absorption coefﬁcient for bremsstrahlung
(κb), and the dashed curve, in red, represents the contribution of gyroresonance (κν = κb + κg) and each
of its respective harmonics (s). The 3rd harmonic occurs between 1150 and 1900 km in altitude, while the
4th harmonic occurs between 2550 and 4050 km. As for the 5th harmonic, it occurs between 4250 and
5950 km.

Figure 6b shows the τ variation with the height, where the 3rd and 4th harmonics effectively contribute
to τ . The 3rd harmonic provides an optical depth of τ ∼ 10−1 (Figure 6b red curve) that is three orders
of magnitude greater than the free-free optical depth (Figure 6b black curve). The contribution from the
4th harmonic is an order of magnitude larger than the free-free τ . These results are in agreement with

the studies of Shibasaki et al. (1994), who found that the 3rd harmonic contribution is approximately
three orders of magnitude greater than the 4th harmonic. Despite being optically thin, the gyroresonance
contribution of τ ∼ 10−1 is able to increase the 17 GHz Tb from 10 × 103 K to almost 70 × 103 K thanks
to the high temperature in the gyroresonance layers. To illustrate the contribution of each mechanism at
17 GHz, Figure 6c shows the free-free CF in black and the total CF in red (free-free plus gyroresonance).
While the free-free CF shows a single peak at around 800 km (black curve), when the gyroresonance is
included an intense peak appears at TR/coronal heights (red curve) that is ∼ 20 times greater than the
free-free contribution.

4.3 Comparison of the synthetic and observed radio images

The GA model images were generated with 2” spatial resolution, which is much ﬁner than the resolution
of the radio observations. To compare the simulations with the observations, the model results were
convolved with a 2D Gaussian beam that matches the resolution of the ALMA single-dish observations,
i.e., 25” and 58” at 230 and 100 GHz, respectively. In Figure 7 the 2D structure of AR 12470 observed
with ALMA at 230 and 100 GHz (left panels) is compared with the model results (right panels). The upper
row shows the 100 GHz comparison, while the lower row shows the 230 GHz comparison.

Due to better spatial resolution, the 230 GHz map shows more detail than that observed at 100 GHz, in
both observation and model. The bright features observed at both frequencies are in good agreement with
the simulations. Moreover, due to the small size of the sunspot umbra (25” diameter at its widest), the dark
umbral structure is readily seen at 230 GHz (see the center of panels 7c and 7d), but completely masked
in the 100 GHz simulations due to the convolution with the bright structures around it (see Figure 7a,b).

Even though dark when compared with the surrounding areas, the umbral Tb is only smaller than the
Tb,QS in the 230 GHz observation, and in the model result without the beam convolution, as shown in
Table 3. When convolved to the observational resolution of 25”, the modelled umbral Tb at 230 GHz is at
the same level as Tb,QS. Furthermore, as shown in Table 3, the other AR areas (penumbra and plages) are
brighter than the quiet Sun and showed a greater Tb variation than the umbra. All the simulated areas are
consistent with the observations to within the uncertainties.

The resulting low contrast of the dark umbra with respect to the quiet Sun in the model is due to the
low resolution of the ALMA single-dish observations. Since the umbral size is almost equal to the ALMA
230 GHz beam, the umbral Tb is smoothed with the bright surrounding areas. At the much better resolution
of the ALMA interferometric array, the AR 12470 umbra presented brightness temperature as low as
∼ 0.90 × TqS (see Shimojo et al., 2017). Additionally, the 100 GHz ALMA interferometric observations
obtained on December 16, 2015 showed a mysterious bright structure inside the umbra (Iwai et al., 2017;

the modeled value.

Figure 8 compares the observation obtained at 17 GHz by NoRH (8a) with the model results. Due to
the high Tb in the polarized region (∼ 7.0 × TqS), to visualize the other regions the image display range
was saturated at 3.0 × TqS, allowing us to see bright free-free structures at positions consistent with those
in the ALMA maps. Away from the polarized region, the maximum Tb was close to 2.8 × TqS, and the
average value was 1.58 ± 0.32 × TqS (see Table 4).

At 17 GHz the non-polarized regions appear in the model at positions matching the observed ones.
However, the modeled atmospheric proﬁles that achieved good agreement with the Tb observations at 230
and 100 GHz were not able to reach the high Tb values observed at 17 GHz. While these regions showed
observational values as high as 2.8 × TqS, the model was only able to reach a maximum Tb of 1.2 × TqS
(Figure 8b). Moreover, since each modeled pixel used the same form of atmospheric proﬁle to model
the 3 frequencies (230, 100, and 17 GHz), we might expect the model to show good agreement with the
bright and dark regions. The free-free regions bright at 17 GHz in the model (Figure 8b) have good spatial
agreement with those ones modeled at 230 and 100 GHz (Figure 7b,d).

If only free-free emission is considered, at 17 GHz the umbra appears darker in the model than
the surrounding area, with a brightness temperature of 1.06 ± 0.02 × TqS at 10” resolution. When
gyroresonance is included, the modeled Tb increased to values above 10 × TqS. As summarized in Table 4,
when gyroresonance is taken into account the Tb values obtained for the highly polarized region are in
agreement with those observed. Nevertheless, as can be observed in Figure 3, the shape of the modelled
polarized region is smaller and rounder, while the observed source appears elliptical.

5 CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this work, we present a data-constrained model of the solar atmosphere, in which we used the brightness
temperatures of AR NOAA 12470 observed at three radio frequencies: 17 GHz from NoRH, and 100 and
230 GHz from ALMA single-dish data. Under the assumption that the radio emission originates from
the combination of thermal free-free and gyroresonance processes, our model allows for calculating radio
brightness temperature maps that can be compared with the observations. The magnetic ﬁeld at distinct
atmospheric heights was determined by a force-free ﬁeld extrapolation using HMI/SDO photospheric
magnetograms. In order to determine the best plasma temperature and density height proﬁles necessary
to match the observations, the Pikaia genetic algorithm (Charbonneau, 1995) is used to modify the
standard quiet Sun atmospheric model characterized by 5 free parameters: the chromospheric gradients
of temperature and electron density, the coronal temperature and density, and the TR height. The SSC
(Selhorst et al., 2005b) was used as the basic quiet Sun model, however, other models could be chosen

as the basic model. The GA modiﬁed the SSC model to ﬁt three distinct classes of active region features,
deﬁned by their magnetic ﬁeld intensities: umbrae, penumbrae, and plages.

As seen in Figure 7 and Table 3, at the ALMA wavelengths the model was in general agreement with the
observations. The umbral region looks dark at 230 GHz and the brighter regions match the positions seen
in the observations at both frequencies (230 and 100 GHz). However, due to the small size of the umbra
(diameter . 25′′), it is not apparent in the 100 GHz data or model. Moreover, as shown by the ALMA
interferometric observations at 230 GHz (Shimojo et al., 2017), the umbral region is darker (∼ 0.90×TqS)
than the single dish maps show (0.99 ± 0.04 × TqS), implying that the umbra will be darker at 100 and
17 GHz. Nevertheless, there are no observational data to conﬁrm that. While at 17 GHz the umbral free-
free emission is masked by the bright source due to gyroresonance opacity, at 100 GHz, the interferometric
image showed the presence of a bright structure inside the umbral region (Iwai et al., 2017), that may be
produced higher in the atmosphere than the region where the umbral emission is formed.

Since the umbra is the region with the greatest magnetic ﬁeld intensity (| ~B|), it is also the location
where the 17 GHz gyroresonance emission arises. As reported in previous works (Shibasaki et al., 1994;
Vourlidas et al., 2006; Selhorst et al., 2008), gyroresonance emission at 17 GHz is typically formed at
the 3rd harmonic (| ~B| = 2000 G), and needs to be well above the TR where the free-free emission is
optically thin. However, the free-free contribution function is much smaller than that of the gyroresonance
(Figure 6c). Moreover, if only thermal free-free emission was contributing opacity at 17 GHz, the AR
umbra should look darker than the surrounding region (see Figure 8b) and probably darker than the quiet
Sun as the high resolution ALMA interferometric data suggest.
