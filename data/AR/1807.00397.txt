prediction is model-dependent, we argue that the ﬁt is aﬀected by an extra choice, namely a
model for atomic clocks, which, in principle, produces observable eﬀects. To the best of our
knowledge, these eﬀects have not being considered in the literature before.

We now have signiﬁcant evidence that standard GR cannot account for observations if we
restrict the sources of the gravitational ﬁeld to the matter we are most familiar with. This
is true now at cosmological scale (see [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]), for almost a century at the scale
galaxy cluster dynamics (see [6], [7]), and, more recently, at the scale of galaxies (see [8], [9],
[10] and [11]).

At more or less all scales, maybe with the exception of the Earth and the solar system,
one can call for new sources we are not able to see directly yet (which are collectively named
dark sources) or, alternatively, for a modiﬁcation of the dynamics of the gravitational ﬁeld
(i.e. the prescription of how ordinary visible matter generates a gravitational ﬁeld). It is clear
that a priori the two approaches are equally possible (and somehow equivalent) until we have
a direct evidence of dark sources other than gravitational ones, that, currently, we do not
have.

In terms of modiﬁcations of dynamics, we have a (too) rich list of proposals: conformal
gravity, MOND, metric, Palatini, and metric-aﬃne f (R)-theories, torsion, Lovelock, just to
quote a few. Each one has proven well in some speciﬁc situation, but none have yet proven
to be a solution in general. Hence, one needs a generic and robust framework to test models
with a solid control on observational protocols, which often are not uniquely determined by
the action principle, but they are extra choices one does to connect to observations.

has no spatial curvature k = 0.

(cid:39)

The ΛCDM-model is considered the best description of current observations, a kind of
standard which any other proposed model must reproduce. One also often believes that the

dark matter added from cosmological evidence is the same dark matter one needs in galaxy
and cluster dynamics, an identiﬁcation for which, however, a detailed quantitative parallel
is missing and it is currently theoretically out of reach. To state the obvious, extrapolating
matter equations of state (EoS), which are already an approximation, from a cosmological
scale down to a galactic scale is brave, not even mentioning the lack of knowledge behind the
fact we do not know an elementary counterpart for dark matter.

Of course, the same bravery is needed in trying to extend the same dynamics from human
scale up to cosmology, not to mention down to the quantum world. Furthermore, often most
observations rely on a gravitational model for interpretation and that such an interpretation is
often quite fragile with respect to modiﬁcation of assumptions about geometry of spacetime.
We have to admit that, beside raw data, we do not know much for sure and currently any
study needs extra care.

Among modiﬁcations of gravitational dynamics, we shall here consider a particular class,
namely the extended theories of gravitation (see [12], [13], [14]). In extended theories of grav-
itation, one has a Weyl geometry on spacetime, i.e. (M, g, ˜Γ), instead of the usual Lorentzian
metric structure. The (torsionless) connection ˜Γ is a priori independent of the metric g.
While the connection describes the free fall of test particles (and light rays) in the gravita-
tional ﬁeld, the metric g is chosen to simplify the gravity-matter coupling and (consequently)
to account for atomic clocks and, in turn, our protocols for measuring distances.

The dynamics are chosen so that the metric and the connection, a priori independent,
turn out to be a posteriori, i.e. as a consequence of ﬁeld equations, EPS-compatible (see [15]),
which means there exists a 1-form A = A(cid:15)dx(cid:15) such that

This framework is theoretically inspired and motivated by a work on foundations of
gravitational physics by Ehlers-Pirani-Schild (EPS); see [15]. The application to extended
theories is described in [16], [13], [14], [17].

In an extended gravitational theory, one has modiﬁcations of dynamics which can equiv-
alently be seen as eﬀective sources. Extended theories also contain standard GR, with or
without a cosmological constant, as a special (quite degenerate) case.

R

A class of dynamics which are automatically extended theories of gravitation are Palatini
)-theories (see below and [18]), in which, ﬁeld equations not only imply EPS-compatibility,
f (
but they also imply that A is closed or, equivalently, that ˜Γ is metric, i.e. ˜Γ =
for a metric
˜g which is conformal to g. Being g and ˜g conformal, they deﬁne the same pointwise causal
structure, the same light cones, the same light-like geodesics. However, they deﬁne diﬀerent
timelike geodesics so that it is important to declare that ˜g, rather than g, deﬁnes the free fall
of test particles. Also, being conformal, the g-length of a ˜Γ-parallelly transported vector is
not preserved, though at least it depends on the point only, not on the curve along which is
parallelly transported.

For example, once we know the ﬁeld ˜g, then the conformal factor ϕ as well as the metric g

without exciting the others. The dynamics of ϕ and g (or ˜g) are uniquely determined once
the dynamics of ˜g (or g) is given, as it usually happens to Lagrangian multipliers. The metric
g shares with Lagrangian multipliers the fact that it enters the gravitational Lagrangian with
no derivatives (so, in a sense, its ﬁeld equations are algebraic).

Consequently, ﬁnding a solution in a Palatini f (

)-theory actually means determining
all ˜g, the conformal factor ϕ, as well as the original metric g. Of course, one could recast the
action functional in terms of purely g or ˜g, though at the price of making the matter–gravity
coupling more complicated and messing up with the interpretation of the theory about which
we made a clear choice: times and distances are measured with g, free fall with ˜g.

R

Traditionally, doing all with the metric g is referred as the Jordan frame, while using ˜g is
called the Einstein frame. In the model we study in this paper, we do not use either the Jordan
or the Einstein frame. We argue instead that one should not expect either of the metrics to be
used for everything, as it happens in standard GR, and that is the essence of Weyl geometries.
It is clear, for example by EPS kinematic analysis, that free fall and the causal structure are
structures coming from diﬀerent physical phenomena (free fall is associated to test particles,
causality to light rays) and one has no reason to assume a priori a constraint between them.
The choice of ˜g for geodesics and g for causal and metric structures is precisely what makes
this model diﬀerent from the other analyses in which one frame is chosen to describe both
structures. We shall eventually argue that this feature turns out to be in principle observable
and important when one is going to compare the model with the solar system classical tests.

R

The main aim of this paper is to discuss the application of a speciﬁc model of a Palatini
)-theory to cosmology. We discuss how the interpretation of the gravitational physics is
f (
extended from a Lorentzian metric geometry, to the more general Weyl conformal geometry,
Furthermore, we investigate how the observations are interpreted in this more general setting
(see [19]), which contains the standard GR case as a special case, as we said. If one does
not like the model on a physical stance, one can regard this paper as a proposal for setting
a rigorous standard for interpretation of observations in cosmology as well as an example of
how a model should be discarded from an observational stance. As a matter of fact, Palatini
)-theories are naturally candidates to be at least a setting for understanding tests of
f (
GR in a wider context, something which was originally done with Brans-Dicke theories for
historical reasons (see [20]) while we are suggesting it should be done in extended gravity.

The choice of function (2.2) has been not very thoughtful. If one sets γ = 0 the master
equation becomes too easy to be inverted, but one has no late acceleration. Moreover, here
we want to set up a framework able to deal with more generic f (
), rather then choosing
one for which we can easily do the computations. Under this viewpoint, the function (2.2)
shows a number of pathologies which are good to learn to cope with, at least in a classical
regime. On the other hand, we do not want to add too many terms, keeping the degeneracy
minimal. The more parameters one adds the easier the ﬁtting becomes, the more experiments
one should use to actually remove degeneracy and to really constrain the parameters.

R

If we had chosen γ = 0, we would obtain a sort of Starobinsky model (see [21]), though
in Palatini formalism. That is simpler to analyse (the master equation is globally and ana-
lytically invertible). However, in this simpliﬁed model, one will have no negative pressure in
eﬀective EoS, no late time acceleration, the conformal factor will be asymptotically constant.
Still, also in this model, one has a bouncing rather than an initial singularity (in the Jordan
frame).

Similar models have been considered in the purely metric formulation, see [22] [23], [24],
[25].
It has been argued that these models are not viable as physical models, mainly for
stability issues and classical tests; see [27], [28], [29], [30]. On this basis, further models have
been proposed in the metric formalism to address these shortcomings; see [31], [32], [33]. Even
if, in view of the non-equivalence between the metric and the Palatini formulation, the same
critiques do not apply directly to our model, we believe it is useful to brieﬂy review them in
a purely metric context to pinpoint what they exactly disprove.

Most of the models proposed deal with cosmology only, where they used Jordan frame.
All the critiques deal with stability and solar system tests (or, equivalently, Newtonian limit)
in the Jordan frame as well. They show in many cases the Jordan frame is not viable in the
solar system. However, in cosmology, one uses only light and comoving test particles which,
as a consequence of cosmological principle, are shared by the Jordan and Einstein frames.
As a consequence, in cosmology (at least until perturbations are considered) one never really
uses the metric ˜g. If it is certainly true that solar system tests do not allow g-geodesics to
describe test particles, however, it is also true that assuming that test particles are described
by ˜g does not change anything in the cosmological model and it gives a diﬀerent solar system
model (which, by the way, can pass the tests quite easily, in view of the universality theorem;
see [34]).

Accordingly, we completely agree that (metric) f (R)-theories in the Jordan frame (at
least the ones considered in the references above) are not compatible with solar system tests.
We just need to mention that when doing cosmology, one is not really compelled to declare the
frame and there are mixed models, in which both g and ˜g are used to do diﬀerent things, which
have not been discussed explicitly. It is our opinion they should be discussed and possibly
disproven as well. Let us stress that, in f (
)-theory there is no dynamical equivalence
R
between purely metric and Palatini formalisms, even at the level of a simple counting of
physical degrees of freedom. Accordingly, disproving metric models leaves Palatini models
unchallenged.

Of course, one could argue that, because of the form of the action functional, this model
is certainly non-renormalisable and that the Minkowski metric is not even a solution. Of
It may be that the
course, this is true also for standard GR with a cosmological term.
model is not well suited for quantum gravity. However, on one hand, we do not know what
quantum gravity will eventually be precisely or whether it will require renormalisable theories
or it will rather be non-perturbative in nature. On the other hand, we are here discussing a

– 4 –

classical model, which unfortunately has nothing to do (observationally speaking) with the
quantum regime. And there are many ways a classical model with a singular Lagrangian
can well behave, especially if the standard for well-behaviour is what happens in standard
GR, in which singularities are already bound to appear generically. Kepler motion in a plane
is another example of a singular Lagrangian which is accepted to describe a well-behaving
(mechanical) system, in which the conservation of angular momentum prevents, most of the
times, the system to get to the singularity.

As far as the fact that Minkowski is not even a solution, the identiﬁcation of Minkowski,
and only Minkowski spacetime, as the vacuum state of gravitational ﬁeld is already quite
dubious at a fundamental level. A theory involving a metric ﬁeld has no canonical vacuum
just because metrics (or vielbein) do not carry a linear (or aﬃne) structure. Metric theories
are diﬀerent from all other fundamental ﬁeld theories. Already standard GR is a peculiar ﬁeld
theory in which one should learn to live without many of the structures used in ﬁeld theories
in Special Relativity (SR). For example, in GR one has no linear structure for conﬁgurations,
generically no Killing vectors, no ﬁxed background.

In what follows, we shall assume that the connection ˜Γ is responsible for free fall. Par-
ticles will follow geodesic trajectories of ˜Γ. The metric g is related to distances on spacetime
and its causal structures, e.g. the light cones. For example, a freely falling atomic clock will
follow a timelike geodesics worldline with respect to ˜g, though the parameterisation is chosen
to be proper with respect to g. Of course, the diﬀerence is expected to be tiny, though we

have to keep in mind that we wish then to discuss objects going around for 3
plenty of time to grow the tiny diﬀerence until it may become appreciated. Extrapolation at
scales by many order of magnitudes requires good deﬁnitions and possibly no mathematical
approximations.

·

If experience still eventually points in favour of standard GR dynamics, we shall have
obtained it without relying on unnecessary theoretical assumptions, but based on experience
and a better understanding of which assumptions we rely on.

In the literature, there are not many studies for Palatini f (R)-theories; see [35], [36]
and references quoted therein. See also [37], [38], [39] for polynomial models. This is often
argued to be due to a number of problems that Palatini f (R)-theories are supposed to have
which have been however refuted; see [40], [41]. We shall not discuss here these issues since
they are discussed in [42], [43], [44], [13], [45].

The third equation Ei = 0 is obtained as a variation of the action with respect to the

cosmology, one does not give a precise Lagrangian description of the matter dynamics, which
is described (under additional assumptions) by EoS, thanks to which Friedmann equations
become well-posed. Accordingly, we shall neglect the speciﬁc form for it.

In both cases, the energy–momentum stress tensors ( ˜Tµν or ˆTµν) need to be modiﬁed by

This is where eﬀective dark sources come from in Palatini f (

matter is, it is described by Tµν, then ˜Tµν directly gets extra contributions from the modiﬁed
) which, hopefully, by choosing it accordingly, can be used
dynamics, i.e. from the function f (
to model dark matter and energy as eﬀective sources. This is not the only eﬀect in extended
theories. Also the odd deﬁnition of atomic clocks (which are free falling with respect to ˜g
but proper with respect to g) produces extra accelerations in particles. These accelerations
are universal, i.e. they are easily confused with an extra gravitational ﬁeld acting on all test
particles equally which, when reviewed in a standard GR setting, calls for other sources.
Hereafter, we shall investigate the combination of these two types of eﬀects in cosmology.

R

R

It is precisely because we chose ˜g to describe test particles that we are not working in
the Jordan frame, and because we chose g to describe clocks that we are not working in the
Einstein frame, either. That is true, even though, when we restrict to cosmology, one could
argue that we are working in the Jordan frame since the comoving structure is shared by
those two frames. However, the Einstein frame pops out again if we go to discuss gravity in
the solar system, where choosing the frame to describe test particles leads to diﬀerent models.

3 Extended cosmologies

Let us consider a four dimensional spacetimes with a Weyl geometry (M, g,
). If we want
to build a cosmological model based on the extended theories described above, we need to
impose the cosmological principle. Of course, with two metrics, one should at least stop and
think which metric should obey the cosmological principle. The good news is that (since the
master equation holds) it does not matter: g is spatially homogeneous and isotropic iﬀ ˜g is.
The only diﬀerence is that, if g is in FLRW form in coordinate (t, r, θ, φ), with a scale factor
a, then ˜g is in FLRW form in coordinate (˜t, r, θ, φ), with a scale factor ˜a = √ϕ a. If the
conformal factor is a function only of time, the new time is deﬁned by d˜t = √ϕdt.

Thus one has a Friedmann equation both for a and ˜a

˙a2 = Φ(a)

˙˜a2 = ˜Φ(˜a)

(3.1)

– 6 –

which are, of course, deﬁned to be equivalent. The speciﬁc form of the function Φ(a) and
˜Φ(˜a) are obtained by expanding the Einstein equations (2.5), which are, in fact, equivalent.
As a consequence of the cosmological principle, the energy-momentum tensor Tµν is in

the form of a perfect ﬂuid energy-momentum tensor, namely

Tµν = c−1 (cid:0)(ρc2 + p)uµuν + pgµν

(cid:1)

(3.2)

for some time-like, future directed, g-unit, comoving vector uµ. Also ˆTµν can be recast in the
same form (for diﬀerent ˆρ and ˆp), as well as ˜Tµν is a perfect ﬂuid energy-momentum tensor
using ˜g and a suitable ˜g-unit vector ˜u as well as diﬀerent eﬀective pressure and density ˜p and
˜ρ.

To establish an equivalence between Einstein equations and Friedmann equation, we
need conservation of the relevant energy-momentum tensors. Luckily enough, once again, if

Finally, we need to state the EoS for matter. This is where the game becomes odd:
imposing the EoS for visible matter, i.e. for p and ρ appearing in Tµν, the EoS for ˜ρ and ˜p in
˜Tµν are uniquely determined (as well as the EoS for ˆρ and ˆp in ˆTµν). However, “simplicity” is
not preserved. Even if we assume visible matter to be simply dust (i.e. we select p = 0 as EoS)
then the EoS for eﬀective matter is determined, though the eﬀective EoS is very exotic and
non-linear. Even if we regard it as a mixture of simple polytropic ﬂuids, the decomposition is
not canonical and, in any event, it contains diﬀerent polytropic ﬂuids. Again, since we wish to
discuss a model at cosmological scale, it is necessary to avoid mathematical approximations
in EoS and learn to live with what we have, even when it is complicated to compute.

As the usual in cosmology, one normalises the scale factor to be unit today, i.e. a(t0) = 1.
Since the conformal factor is deﬁned up to a constant factor which does not aﬀect Christoﬀel
symbols
, one can also normalise the conformal factor to be (positive and) ϕ(t0) = 1, so
that the conformal transformation preserves the (positivity and) normalisation of the scale
factor and one has also ˜a(˜t0) = 1.

˜g

{

Regardless which equation of (3.1) we decide to solve, once we have t(a), then the know
the conformal factor as a function of a from the master equation, so we also have ˜a(a). Then
we also know ϕ(a) and hence ˜t(a), ρ(a), p(a), ˜ρ(a), ˜p(a) and so on. We get everything as a
function of a so all quantities are known in parametric form as function of every other (and
no need to invert functions, other than the master equation).

ρc2)
For an energy-momentum tensor in the form of a perfect ﬂuid, we have T = c−1(3p
and, for simplicity, we set the EoS for visible dust p = 0. That, in view of energy-momentum
tensor conservation, is equivalent to set ρ(a) := ρ0a−3.

For any given value of the spatial curvature k one can compute the corresponding value
of the density which produces it. As usual the critical density is the density which produces
a spatially ﬂat spacetime k = 0. Thus we have a 3-parameter family of extended models, all

4 Distances in extended theories

To ﬁt data from supernovae (SNIa), we need a precise deﬁnition of the luminosity distance
dL, the proper distance δ, and the red-shift z of a source within our model. In particular,
we need to extend the standard discussion which is based on a Lorentzian geometry to an
(integrable) Weyl geometry (M, g,

).

In cosmology, one deﬁnes spatial distances as the geometric distance on the surface
t = t0, without relying on synchronisation of clocks, which, of course, would be impractical in

astrophysics since easily it would take millions (if not billions) of years for a signal to bounce
back and forth from another galaxy. Any comoving observer, at its time t = t0, deﬁnes a
surface t = t0 and chooses a geodesics on the surface (with respect to the metric induced
on the surface by g). The proper distance δ(t0) is then the g-length of such a (space-like)
geodesics.

Let us remark that the geodesic on the surface is in general not a geodesic on spacetime,

as a geodesic on a sphere S2 in R3 is not a straight line.

The surface t = t0, which is here deﬁned using the time coordinate, can also be deﬁned
in terms of the Killing algebra of isometries prescribed by the cosmological principle in an
intrinsic fashion.

The proper distance is a geometric well-deﬁned distance, though it is diﬃcult to deﬁne
a protocol to measure it directly. We use it as a benchmark to refer the luminosity distance
dL and the red-shift z of a source.

In our model, light rays move along geodesics of ˜g which are light-like with respect to
g. However, since g and ˜g are conformal, they share the same light-like geodesics. So we can
consider light-like geodesics using only the metric g. Accordingly, the red-shift is given by

z(a) =

ao

a

−
a

(4.1)

where ae = a is the scale factor of g at emission, ao at observation. If we make observations
today, of course we have ao = 1. The scale factor ˜a of the metric ˜g does not play a role in
observations until we assume that atomic clocks are proper for g and not for ˜g, though they
free fall along ˜g-geodesics.

This can also be shown in detail, directly by repeating the standard argument in a Weyl

geometry; see [46].

Similarly, the area of the sphere S2 for t = t0 and r = r∗, measured by the metric g is
∗. Accordingly, the luminosity distance of a comoving source at r = r∗

exactly A = 4πa2(t0)r2
observed at t = t0 is

dL = (1 + z)aor∗

(4.2)

which, if k = 0, is exactly dL = (1 + z)δ(to, r∗). If one wishes not to assume k = 0, depending
on the sign of k, r∗ is anyway a known function of the proper distance.

There is no mathematical approximation we made here, in particular, we are not re-

stricting ourselves to near sources by using a linear approximation of the Hubble law.

Now we know z(a) as a function of the emission scale factor. If we observe today sources
at diﬀerent distances, we have their proper distance δ(to, r∗) as a function of the emission

5 Fitting the Ia type supernovae

Since we know that the relationship between the magnitude of a far standard electromagnetic
source (e.g. Ia type supernovae) and the observed redshift is determined by the dynamics of
the scale factor a(t), it is possible to use statistical inference methods to evaluate the agree-
ment between the theoretical prediction within our model and the experimental observations.
The complexity of the modelling of both the theory and observations requires correspond-
ingly reﬁned statistical and data analysis skills. In fact, the measurements of the magnitude
and the redshift of the SNIa must account for a strong uncertainty signal in the background
(see [47]), usually described by two nuisance unknown parameters a and b. For this rea-
son, a Bayesian inference approach is often used in this case (but more generally in all the
cosmological measurements).

We have decided to perform two diﬀerent sets of ﬁt for our model using the data con-
cerning the measurement of the Ia type supernovae magnitude as a function of the observed
redshift. We considered the Supernovae Legacy Survey (SNLS) project catalogue composed
by 115 SNIa (see [47]) and the whole Union2.1 catalogue (see [48]) composed by 580 SNIa.
We have a clear and unambiguous relation between these physical observables and the math-
ematical objects in the theory, which makes these datasets particularly well suited for model-
theoretic parameters ﬁt. The SNLS is a smaller dataset than Union2.1 though its data are
more homogeneous, so we use it as a check for consistency.

The theoretical value of the magnitude m of a source as a function of its redshift z has
been calculated considering the ﬂow of power carried by the momentum-energy tensor asso-
ciated to a high frequency electromagnetic wave propagating in a homogeneous and isotropic
spacetime. One can notice that the explicit form of m(z) is strongly related to the dynamics
of the universe so it depends on the initial conditions (e.g. the baryonic and radiation energy
density today, the Hubble parameter today) as well as the vacuum Lagrangian parameters
that determine the evolution of metric tensor g.

To ﬁt the SNIa data, we relied on the software MULTINEST (see [49], [50], [51]), an
eﬃcient and robust Bayesian inference tool developed to calculate the evidence and obtain-
ing posterior samples from distributions with (an unknown number of) multiple modes and
pronounced (curving) degeneracies between parameters.

The power of the software lies in the algorithm that naturally identiﬁes the individual
modes of a distribution, allowing for the evaluation of the local evidence and parameter

constraints associated with each mode separately. The ﬁt was performed asking MULTINEST
to ﬁnd the free parameters of the theory (α, β, γ, ρ0; a, b) that minimizes the χ2 deﬁned as
following:

- m(z(cid:63)

- σ(mB)2 = σ(m)2 + σ(s)2 + σ(c)2 is the error of the observations. In particular, we
have that σ(m)2 is the error related to the magnitude, σ(s)2 and σ(c)2 are respectively
the errors of the stretch factor and color factor;

int = 0.13104 the error related to the intrinsic dispersion of the real SNIa from the

ideal standard candle.

- N is the number of observed supernovae belonging to the dataset, 115 for the SNLS
dataset, 580 for the Union2.1 dataset.

MULTINEST is also able to provide us with the value of the χ2 evaluated on the best
ﬁt parameters, the posteriors samples and the live points produced by the algorithm. This
is very useful both for checking the right convergence to the minimum and to estimate the
posterior probability distribution of our parameters. The posteriors analysis as well as the
conﬁdence region has been performed using the software GetDist; see [52].

Furthermore, considering the minimum value of the χ2, we can compare diﬀerent theo-

retical models and determine the accuracy of the theoretical predictions.

Diﬀerent cases have been studied: at ﬁrst, we have considered the case in which all the
parameters (α, β, γ, ρ0, a, b) are ﬁtted against the Union2.1 dataset. That ﬁt shows that the
model is strongly degenerate, that the β parameter does not inﬂuence the scale factor at the
scales sampled by the dataset as well as that α is very poorly localized.

Then we analysed cases in which some parameters are set to a value determined by
diﬀerent considered scenarios. That shows that if we have some value for parameters from
tests other than SNIa, the model is still able to ﬁt supernovae, for example to determine the
γ parameter (as well as a and b). This shows how SNIa are unable to ﬁx all parameters of
the model, as one can reasonably expect. The same behaviour in some sense is noticed in
standard GR, where the parameters (α, ρ0) are ﬁxed at diﬀerent scales, α being ﬁxed by the
solar system tests, and ρ0 by supernovae.

Here we expect something similar, only with more parameters. We expect diﬀerent tests
at diﬀerent scales (solar system, light elements formation, . . . ) to remove the degeneracy and
ﬁx best ﬁt value for the parameters. Then, and only then, the model can be tested to predict
new phenomena (e.g. BAO, lensing, . . . ).

The goodness of the ﬁt is not particularly relevant here, since the best ﬁt parameters
conﬁdence intervals indicate that, as one could expect, the system is quite degenerate and
some of the parameters, α, β, γ in the ﬁrst place, are quite poorly constrained. This ﬁt is also
compatible with negative densities of radiation which are of course unphysical. Let us notice
that, ﬁrst of all, one can interpret it as saying that SNIa are not able to constrain radiation,
i.e. that, as far as only SNIa are concerned, the radiation density could be zero. As for
removing degeneracy, one will need further tests to ﬁx radiation contribution. Secondly, we
are interested here in showing that the extended model we are discussing will be potentially
able to ﬁt data with the same visible sources and no dark sources at a fundamental level.
This is a long process, it will take into consideration many diﬀerent tests as explained in
Conclusions. In the following ﬁts concerning SNIa, we shall ﬁx a radiation density similar

This time we see that the ﬁt is better convincing. The only issue with respect to ΛCDM

We see that in this fourth ﬁt the obtain more or less the same dust density as in ΛCDM,
thus conﬁrming that one can change α and ρd
0 accordingly, so that the ﬁt adjusts the value
of γ but still it is a good ﬁt. That explicitly highlights the degeneracy we originally guessed.
We also checked what happens in the third and fourth ﬁts by restricting to the SNLS
dataset. The SNLS is smaller, so we expect higher errors, though it is more homogeneous, so
we might prevent systematic errors in calibration. For this reason, it is interesting to check
that one obtains about the same results as with Union2.1 dataset.

We obtained best ﬁt values which are completely compatible with the ones of the Union

2.1 catalogue, both with reduced chi-squared values of χ2

R = 1.390.

The last ﬁts are reasonably good (maybe they show a overestimation of the errors). They
show us the way to test the model. One needs more tests, for example solar system tests
and light elements formation, to ﬁx α and β. Then, with that extra information, supernovae
seem to be able to determine the parameter γ (as well as the matter content ρd
0, the Hubble
parameter H0, and the nuisances a and b).

6 Conclusions and perspectives

We can conclude that we have many degrees of freedom and degeneracy in the parameters,
too many and too much to determine all parameters just by ﬁtting the SNIa. However, if we
impose some theoretical constraints, for example by tests at diﬀerent scales, we are always
able to determine at least the value of γ, as well as H0, a and b, in diﬀerent scenarios. More
tests are needed. Tests are model dependent and each new test must be done within a model
framework. It is dangerous and reckless to guess the results on the basis of an intuition which
has been developed in standard GR.

Only after one has enough tests to remove the degeneracy and ﬁx the model, then new
phenomena will allow us to discuss the predictivity of the theory. Currently, we believe that
solar system test can ﬁx α, while light elements production could ﬁx β. Only at that point
could one really discuss the physical content of the theory, for example by discussing BAO,
CMB, structures formation, gravitational lensing, galaxies and clusters dynamics (see [53]),
for each of which one still needs to develop a complete treatment within the framework of
f (

)-Palatini theories.
The speciﬁc model we consider here produces late time acceleration, it is compatible with
SNIa observations (as many other models are, including ΛCDM), it predicts a cosmological

This approach is also interesting because it poses a new standard for tests, with respect
to the traditional comparison with Brans-Dicke models, which is now much better founded
on ﬁrst principles, e.g. in view of EPS. Let us remark that if standard GR, in order to ﬁt
observations, needs to account for dark sources (at all scales) at a fundamental level, then
alternative, modiﬁed or extended theories of gravitation need to account (thoroughly and
in full detail) for how observations arise in their framework. One cannot simply say that a
model ﬁts observations without dark sources, and not explaining in details where the extra
accelerations (which are usually interpreted as the eﬀect of the gravitational ﬁeld produced
by dark matter) come from.

Here we considered a speciﬁc Palatini f (

)-theory, we assumed an interpretation for
the ﬁelds g, ˜g, and matter ﬁelds, which supports EPS framework and provides us with a solid
bridge between the model and observational protocols. These assumptions are not proven,
they are part of the model speciﬁcation and can be falsiﬁed or corroborated by experiments.
That is the correct way of proceeding.

R

From our analysis, it seems that either α is much smaller than expected or dust density is
much higher than usually supposed. Within this model,if a smaller value of α is not supported
by observations, then either one has more dust around or the model is contradicted by current
cosmological data. One could also argue that one needs the dark matter contribution to the
dynamics (Ωb+Ωc
0.30) for non-cosmological reasons (galaxies and cluster dynamics) which
are quite well established. However, one should say that to discuss galaxy models in a Palatini
)-theories, one should also consider the eﬀect of conformal factor, that in these models
f (
is expected to depend on r, not (only) on cosmological t. Is that enough to ﬁt observations
without adding dark matter?

R

(cid:39)

We are also planning to devote future investigations to describe, the evolution of the
Hubble parameter H(z) as a function of distance (being the distance parameterised by z, a,
or t) within this model. That will provide a test when the new data for Hubble drift will
be available and, at least, it provides new evidence that Palatini f (
)-theories can be, in
principle, falsiﬁed by the observations.

R

We are currently working to split the eﬀects in extended theories, into the component
due to eﬀective sources from the eﬀects due to the atomic clocks being proper with respect
to a metric which is not the one describing free fall of test particles. Our interpretation is
well based in EPS framework, though being able to split the eﬀects, will enable us to test this
assumption by experiments.

Also a full analysis of the dynamical system describing the cosmological sector of this
theory would be interesting, as done in [39] for polynomial models. Here, we rather analysed
the system around a speciﬁc set of parameters, while a full analysis would highlight whether
one can have ﬁnite time singularities for other values of the parameters. For now, we know
no ﬁnite time singularity arises for our best ﬁt parameters.

Of course, one would need also perturbation theories, structure formation, lensing, in-

– 16 –

teractions with particle models (e.g. baryogenesis), the evolutions of perturbations of CMB
and many other aspects. The point is that proceeding in that direction is the only way to
falsify models on a certain basis.

And that is the only thing we can do, until we are able to discuss model properties

without ﬁxing the function f (

), something which currently is completely out of reach.

Appendix A: Qualitative graphs

The model is solved as soon as we get t(a), see (3.13). All other quantities can be computed
as functions of a so that they all can be plotted with respect to all the others in parametric
form. For realistic parameters, graphs are diﬃcult to be analyzed since the interesting features
occur at many order of magnitude away one from the others. So here we collect the graphs
for the parameters values

α = 1

as a function of the scale factor a. The function f (

In view of the master equation and EoS for visible matter, equation (3.6) expresses the
) is given as a function of
curvature
a as f (+
1)2) in Figure 6.a. That corresponds, near
today, to approximately standard GR with a positive cosmological constant. Going back in
time the action climbs the dune and falls down again unlike in ΛCDM. Also the limit for
a−3. For this reason, we call this
a
model dune cosmology.

The Weierstrass function Φ(a), which determines the Friedmann equation for the scale
factor a, for these parameters is shown in Figure 6.b. One can see that there is a bounded
allowed region (0, a1] (corresponding to a universe which readily recollapses) as well as an
unbounded one [a2, +
) in which we are now. The scale factor a = a2 acts as a reﬂection
point (i.e. a bouncing point). The second derivative of the Weierstrass function acts as a
driving force. Accordingly, a positive second derivative indicates an accelerating expansion
while around the maximum we have a deceleration phase.

The conformal factor ϕ(a) is presented in Figure 6.c, ˜a(a) =
ﬁnally ˜t(a) in Figure 7.b, which is obtained by integrating the equation

(cid:112)

ϕ(a) a in Figure 7.a, and

(6.2)

Then we integrate t(a) (in Figure 7.c) which in fact exhibits an initial slowing down

phase, followed by an accelerated expansion.

At that point one can graph all quantities as a function of all the others, for example
the EoS for eﬀective matter ˜p(˜ρ) (see Figure 8.a) and the evolution of the scale factor of ˜g as
a function of ˜t, i.e. ˜a(˜t) (see Figure 8.b).

As long as the old question of which frame is physical, if g or ˜g, the issue is simply ignored
since the quantities are all physical in a sense, just some physical structures are associated to
g, some to ˜g. The issue is also meaningless since the two metrics after all are one a function
of the other, so that they both equally are physical or unphysical in a sense.
