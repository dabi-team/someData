Draft version December 13, 2019

ABSTRACT
Penumbral transient brightening events have been attributed to magnetic reconnection episodes oc-
curring in the low corona. We investigated the trigger mechanism of these events in active region
NOAA 12546 by using multi-wavelength observations obtained with the Interferometric Bidimen-
sional Spectrometer (IBIS), by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Hinode satellites. We focused on the evolution of an area of the penum-
bra adjacent to two small-scale emerging ﬂux regions (EFRs), which manifested three brightening
events detected from the chromosphere to the corona. Two of these events correspond to B-class
ﬂares. The same region showed short-lived moving magnetic features (MMFs) that streamed out from
the penumbra. In the photosphere, the EFRs led to small-scale penumbral changes associated with a
counter-Evershed ﬂow and to a reconﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁelds in the moat. The brightening
events had one of the footpoints embedded in the penumbra and seemed to result from the distinc-
tive interplay between the pre-existing penumbral ﬁelds, MMFs, and the EFRs. The IRIS spectra
measured therein reveal enhanced temperature and asymmetries in spectral lines, suggestive of event
triggering at diﬀerent height in the atmosphere. Speciﬁcally, the blue asymmetry noted in C II and
Mg II h&k lines suggests the occurrence of chromospheric evaporation at the footpoint located in the
penumbra as a consequence of magnetic reconnection process at higher atmospheric heigths.

1. INTRODUCTION
Present-day high resolution observations reveal the dy-
namic ﬁne scale structure of sunspots created by mag-
netoconvective interactions (Borrero & Ichimoto 2011;
Rempel & Schlichenmaier 2011). Small-scale features in
sunspot (umbral and penumbra) vary in space and time
due to a number of diﬀerent processes. These include
oscillations, waves, jets of plasma, and magnetic recon-
nection. That is believed to lead to ﬂaring events. These
latter phenomena, involve plasma heating, particle accel-
eration, and the release of electromagnetic energy from
X-rays to radio wavelengths (Shibata & Magara 2011;
Benz 2017).

Smaller-scale energy release phenomena detected over
and near sunspots penumbrae have been related to
new magnetic elements in emerging ﬂux regions (EFRs,
e.g. Guglielmino 2012; Cheung & Isobe 2014) and to
magnetic features moving away from the sunspot to-
ward the boundary of the moat region (MMFs, see,
e.g. Criscuoli et al. 2012; Li et al. 2019, and references
therein), which can cancel with pre-existing magnetic
ﬁelds.

In this regard, Kano et al. (2010) analyzed microﬂares
around a well-developed sunspot, by using Hinode
(Kosugi et al. 2007) satellite data from the X-ray Tele-
scope (XRT, Golub et al. 2007) and the Narrowband
Filter Imager mounted on the Solar Optical Telescope
(Tsuneta et al. 2008). They found that half of the ob-
served microﬂares were caused by magnetic ﬂux cancella-

tion (encounters of opposite polarities in their paper) and
when the latter is the main responsible, the microﬂare
has one of the X-ray loop connecting the penumbra to
the opposite-polarity patch of an EFR or a MMF em-
bedded in the moat.

Recently, Bai et al. (2016) reported on a penumbral
transient brightening observed with state-of-the-art in-
struments installed in the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS, De Pontieu et al. 2014) satellite and
1.6 m New Solar Telescope (Cao et al. 2010; Goode et al.
2010) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory. This penum-
bral brightening, whose estimated thermal energy was
in the range of nanoﬂares (1022 − 1025 erg), that dis-
played signatures from the chromosphere to the corona.
The same authors found that a MMF had appeared close
to the penumbral boundary and at the same location of
one of the footpoints associated with the observed bright-
ening. Bai et al. (2016) attributed the triggering mech-
anism of the analyzed event to magnetic reconnection
occurring in the low corona and explained the brighten-
ing seen in transition region (TR) and chromosphere as
due to the local plasma heated up by downward prop-
agating accelerating particles and thermal conduction.
However, due to very weak signals of the observations
analyzed, those authors could not ﬁnd any evidence of
the chromospheric evaporation that is expected to follow
the heating of the chromospheric plasma from reconnec-
tion processes in the low corona. This evaporation has
been reported from analysis of larger ﬂares (Tian et al.
2014; Graham, & Cauzzi 2015), as well as in micro-
(Chen, & Ding 2010) and nano-ﬂares (Testa et al. 2014)
observed outside penumbrae. Since the trigger mecha-
nism of the studied brightening could not be clearly iden-
tiﬁed by their analysis, Bai et al. (2016) solicited more
research on the formation process of brightening events
observed in penumbral regions.

Indeed,

it is well-known that the magnetic recon-

Murabito et al.

nection can occur on any spatial or temporal scale
in the solar atmosphere (Priest & Forbes 2000). Both
the current high-resolution observations and magneto-
hydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations indicate
that interactions of EFRs with pre-existing ambient
magnetic ﬁelds (Cheung & Isobe 2014; Archontis 2012;
Schmieder et al. 2014) play a prominent role in models
of large- (e.g., Louis et al. 2015, and references therein)
and small-scale eruptive events (e.g., Guglielmino et al.
2010, 2018, 2019, and references therein).
In particu-
lar, it is expected that the magnetic reconnection can
occur at diﬀerent atmospheric heights depending on the
overlying and/or background magnetic ﬁelds and on the
strength and size of the EFR (Archontis et al. 2004;
MacTaggart et al. 2015). Furthermore Galsgaard et al.
(2005, 2007) demonstrated that the magnetic reconnec-
tion strongly depends on the relative orientation between
the magnetic ﬁeld components of the emerging ﬂux and
the pre-existing magnetic ﬁeld. In fact, only when the
two ﬂux systems have almost antiparallel orientation the
magnetic reconnection is eﬃcient.

In this study, we analyzed multi-wavelength observa-
tions of the active region (AR) NOAA 12546 obtained
with state-of-the-art instruments to further investigate
the trigger mechanism of penumbral brightening events.
In particular, we studied the evolution of the penumbral
area adjacent to two small-scale EFRs emerged in the
AR on 2016 May 20. The analyzed region showed three
brightening events detected from the chromosphere to
the corona.

The paper is organized as follows: in the next Section
we describe the observations and the data processing ap-
plied. In Section 3 we feature our analysis and results,
which are summarized and discussed in Section 4. Sec-
tion 5 presents our conclusions.

2. DATA AND METHODS
2.1. Observations
We analyzed high spatial, spectral, and temporal
resolution data acquired by the Interferometric Bidi-
mensional Spectrometer (IBIS, Cavallini 2006) at the
Dunn Solar Telescope of the National Solar Obser-
vatory, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI,
Scherrer et al. 2012) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) instruments on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012) satel-
lite, and the IRIS and Hinode/XRT space-borne tele-
scopes.

IBIS observations were carried out on 2016 May 20,
when the AR was characterized by a β magnetic conﬁgu-
ration. The dataset consists of full-Stokes measurements
taken along the Fe I 617.30 nm and Ca II 854.20 nm lines,
each line sampled at 21 spectral positions over a Field-of-
View (FoV) of about 40′′ × 90′′. The data were acquired
with a spectral sampling of 20 m˚A and 60 m˚A, and a
spatial resolution of 0.′′16 and 0.′′23 for the Fe I and Ca II
measurements, respectively, with a cadence of 48 s under
excellent seeing conditions that lasted about 180 minutes
(318 line scans). The data were processed with the meth-
ods described by, e.g., Ermolli et al. (2017). The same
dataset was also analyzed by Stangalini et al. (2018) and
Murabito et al. (2019), which we refer to the reader for
further details.

SDO data comprise the Space-weather HMI Active Re-
gion Patches (SHARPs, Bobra et al. 2014) continuum ﬁl-
tergrams, magnetograms and Dopplergrams derived from
the HMI measurements at the Fe I 617.3 nm line, per-
formed with a resolution of 1′′ and a cadence of 12
minutes from 2016 May 19 at 08:00 UT to May 21 at
08:00 UT. Furthermore, we considered AIA ﬁltergrams
taken at the 1600, 304, 171, 335, and 131 ˚A bands (here-
after referred to as A1600, A304, A171, A335, A131, re-
spectively), with a pixel scale of about 0.′′6 and a cadence
of 12 s and 24 s for the EUV and UV channels, respec-
tively.

The IRIS dataset was acquired at the time of the
IBIS measurements on 2016 May 20 from 13:17 UT
to 16:30 UT.
It consists of a sit-and-stare scan
(OBS362011063) taken with a cadence of 20 s at the
C II 1334.53 ˚A, Si IV 1402.77 ˚A, and Mg II h&k 2796.35
and 2803.53 ˚A lines. Simultaneous slit-jaw ﬁltergrams
(SJIs) were acquired in the passbands of the Si IV 1400 ˚A
line and Mg II k line wing (hereafter referred to as
I1400 and I2832), with a cadence of 20 s and 97 s, re-
spectively, covering a FoV of 120′′ × 119′′. The I1400
and I2832 data sample plasma at T = 65, 000 K and
T = 6, 000 − 10, 000 K, respectively.

Finally, we analyzed Hinode/XRT images

taken
through the Al polyimide and the Be thin ﬁlters, whose
temperature response ranges 6 < log T < 7.5 for the
former, and has a peak at ∼ log T = 7 for the lat-
ter (Golub et al. 2007). The two sets of images were
acquired with a cadence of 60 s and varying exposure
time. These data provide measurements over a FoV of
384′′×384′′, with a pixel size of 1.′′03. Note that XRT ob-
servations were taken simultaneously to IRIS data with
some gaps.

2.2. Data processing
We co-aligned IBIS, SDO /HMI and SDO /AIA obser-
vations by applying cross-correlation techniques on co-
spatial FoVs that were extracted from the three datasets.
In particular, we used the ﬁrst IBIS spectral
image
taken at the Fe I 617.3 nm line continuum on 2016
May 20 at 13:53 UT as a reference and the corresponding,
neighboring-in-time SDO /HMI continuum image and
SDO /AIA A1600 ﬁltergram. We employed IDL Solar-
Soft mapping routines to account for the diﬀerent pixel
size of the data. Since the SDO /AIA data are aligned
between them we employed the SDO /AIA A1600 image
aligned to the IBIS data as a reference for the remaining
SDO /AIA channels. Then, we aligned the IRIS data to
the other measurements, by using the IRIS SJIs I2832 ﬁl-
tergrams and the closest in time SDO /HMI continuum
images. Finally, we aligned the XRT images using the
SDO /AIA A131 ﬁltergrams as an anchor channel. The
precision of our data alignement is comparable to the
pixel size of the SDO observations, about 0.′′6, which is
accurate enough for the analysis presented in the follow-
ing.

To get quantitative estimates of the physical param-
eters in the analyzed region, we inverted the IBIS
data by using the non-LTE inversion code NICOLE
(Socas-Navarro et al. 2015).
In brief, we assumed ﬁve
equidistant nodes for temperature, three nodes for each
component of the vector magnetic ﬁeld (Bx, By, and Bz),

12 minutes.

In addition, we got pixelwise estimates of the LOS
velocity of the photospheric plasma by computing the
Doppler shift of the line core of the IBIS Fe I data with
respect to the average position of the line core in a quiet
Sun region. We computed the line core position by ﬁtting
the Stokes I Fe I measurements with a linear background
and a Gaussian function.

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
From 2016 May 15 to May 25, ground-based and space-
borne solar telescopes detected the on-disk passage of
AR NOAA 12546 (AR hereafter), which emerged in the
southern solar hemisphere close to the equator. This AR
consisted of a leading, large and almost circular sunspot
and a trailing, extended plage region. The sunspot,
which was one among the largest such structures ob-
served over the solar cycle 24, kept its regular shape
nearly unchanged during the disk passage, while the
plage region evolved signiﬁcantly. The studied sunspot
also displayed a large number of MMFs, mostly of type
II, i.e., unipolar features with the same polarity of spot
(e.g., Zuccarello et al. 2009, and references therein), seen
to move almost radially away from the sunspot structure
toward the boundary of the moat region.

Both the SDO /HMI and IBIS photospheric observa-
tions show that the penumbra of AR was formed by
bright ﬁlaments and dark spines nearly radially aligned
over most of the sunspot structure (Murabito et al.
2019), except for an area close to the EFRs observed
on 2016 May 20.

3.1. Magnetic environment in the photosphere
Figure 1 shows the region analyzed in our study as de-
duced from SDO /HMI continuum observation performed
on 2016 May 19 at 13:34 UT and the region of interest
(ROI) discussed in the following and shown in Figures 3,
6, and 7. The bottom panel of Figure 1 displays the LOS
magnetogram with over-plotted horizontal velocity.

Starting from 2016 May 19 12:00 UT the ROI showed
in about 24 hours an increase of the LOS magnetic ﬂux
of about 2 − 4 × 1020 Mx for the positive and negative
polarity, and a ﬂux decrease afterwards. This ﬂux vari-
ation, which is reported in Figure 2, followed the evolu-
tion of the region summarized in the panels of Figure 3,
which show maps from SDO/HMI observations at 9 rep-

Values of the LOS component of the magnetic ﬁeld are saturated
at ±500 G. The black and blue boxes indicate the FoV of the IBIS
and IRIS observations analysed in our study, respectively, while
the red box shows the ROI where the studied brightening events

FLCT is overplotted on the LOS magnetogram. The white refer-

two nodes for the line-of sight (LOS) velocity, and one
node for both the microturbulence and macroturbulence.
We performed the inversions in two cycles, by assuming
as the starting guess model a modiﬁed FALC atmosphere
(Fontenla et al. 1993) with a constant value of 1.5 kG for
Bz. We refer the reader to the paper by Murabito et al.
(2019) for further details.

In order to study the horizontal proper motions and
estimate the velocity of the photospheric plasma, we
applied the Fourier Local Correlation Tracking tech-
nique (FLCT, Fisher & Welsch 2008) to the available
SDO /HMI LOS magnetograms. We set the FWHM of
the Gaussian tracking window to 15 pixels, in order to
follow the collective motions of the magnetic structures,
and made a temporal integration over a time interval of

resentative times from 2016 May 19 08:00 UT to May 21
00:00 UT.

On 2016 May 19 08:00 UT the ROI only included the
southern sector of the penumbra and moat area nearby
(Figure 3, ﬁrst row). A few hours later, at 16:00 UT,
negative polarity patches (labelled N in Figure 3, panel
b2) from new ﬂux of an EFR emerged at X = [20′′, 50′′],
Y = [15′′, 40′′], had already merged with pre-existing
network ﬁeld forming a small pore and a few fainter
structures (labelled N1 and N2 in Figure 3, panel b3).
These structures also received the negative polarity ﬂux
from a second EFR appeared on 2016 May 20 01:00 UT.
Thereafter, positive polarity patches streaming out from
the penumbra and from the second EFR merged to form
small scale structures in the south-east section of the ROI
(at X = [5′′, 30′′], Y = [10′′, 25′′]) that later on, e.g., at
13:48 UT, were only merely discernible.

During the emergence of the second EFR, a bright lane
(marked with red arrows in Figure 3, panels a4-a5) and
a few dark patches (marked with the orange arrow in
Figure 3, panel a6) appeared in the penumbra near the
EFR, by creating a gap in the structure (see green arrows
in Figure 3, panels a4 -a6) that separated ﬁlaments with
diﬀerent orientation.

Later, the ﬁlaments closer to N2 (black oval in Figure 3,
panels b7-b8) broke away from the penumbra (black oval
in Figure 3, panel b8) when the small-scale negative ﬂux
patches from the two EFRs and pre-existing ﬁelds coa-
lesced and got more aggregated (N3 in Figure 3, panel
b7-b9).

The animated version in Figure 3 (panels a and b),
available in the online material clearly shows the entire
evolution described above and the diverse MMFs dis-
cussed below.

The penumbra had a rather homogeneous structure
with ﬁeld inclination of about 60◦ − 90◦ (Figure 3, third
column), except for a few elongated patches with ﬁeld in-
clination in the range 40◦ − 60◦ (marked with the white
oval in Figure 3, panels c3-c7) in the area that broke
away. These features were clearly linked to the positive
polarity patches of the EFR. The region also displayed
two systematic ﬂow patterns, which are shown in Fig-
ure 3 (fourth column). The former, directed towards the
ﬁrst EFR, led to the formation of N3 by the merging of
N1 and N2, while the second southern-ward pattern con-
tributed to the evolution of the small-scale positive po-
larity features. Note that the emergence of both EFRs
was characterized by strong shear motions with values of
−1.

The IBIS data provide a close-up view of the evolution
of the ROI and of the physical properties therein.
In
particular, we show in Figure 4 the analyzed area from
the IBIS observations taken on 2016 May 20 at 14:00 UT
(left panels) and 17:00 UT (right panels), along with re-
sults from their inversion. The IBIS data at 14:00 UT
indicate that the bright gap in the penumbra (yellow
oval) already noticed in the SDO/HMI observations sep-
arates ﬁlaments with diﬀerent orientation in the irregu-
larly shaped penumbral sector. The dark structures (red
arrow), whose length was of about 10′′, decreased in size
over time until they were no longer detected, e.g., on 2016
May 20 at 18:00 UT. Noticeably, the plasma LOS veloc-
ity in small-scale patches of these structures was opposite

about 0.9 kG and ﬁeld inclination ranging from 60◦ to
100◦, except for some small-scale patches in the inhomo-
geneous area with ﬁeld inclination lower than 40◦.

The transients observed in IBIS Ca II data were also
manifested in the evolution of the average intensity mea-
sured over the ROI in the IRIS I1400, SDO /AIA, and
Hinode/XRT observations. Figure 5 compares the light
curves derived from the above data for the time inter-
val of simultaneous IBIS and IRIS data, along with the
variation of the X-ray ﬂux measured by the GOES-15
satellite (Bornmann et al. 1996).

All the light curves shown in Figure 5 display a couple
of remarkable intensity increases standing out with re-
spect to long-term and smooth variations. In particular,
we considered the three abrupt intensity changes marked
with vertical dashed lines in Figure 5 and referred in the
following to as E1, E2, and E3. Two of these peaks,
speciﬁcally E2 and E3, had clear counterparts in the
variation of the X-ray ﬂux measured by GOES -15 (red
curve in Figure 5) and correspond to B-class ﬂares. The
above intensity increases, which lasted a few minutes for
all the considered data, had diﬀerent amplitudes depend-
ing on the event and wavelenght, see, e.g., the peak value
for the E2 and E3 events.

In an attempt to localize the source regions and to in-
vestigate the possible trigger mechanisms of the above
events, Figure 6 displays SDO /HMI, SDO /AIA and
IRIS data taken over the time interval considered in
Figure 5. The various panels in Figure 6 show bright-
ening events whose footpoints and emission contours are
over-plotted on the I2832 observations for ease of com-
parison. We clearly noticed two homologous small-scale
ﬂaring events developed over a sigmoidal region (panels
in ﬁrst and third rows of Figure 6). These events cor-
respond to E1 occurred at 13:27 UT and E3 recorded
by GOES -15 as a B-class ﬂares at 14:32 UT, about one
hour later than E1. The eastern footpoint of the ﬂaring
region was lying in the penumbra, while the other was
close to the patch of negative polarity ﬂux N1. It is worth
noting that the latter footpoint can be easily identiﬁed
in most of the SDO /AIA coronal observations that also
show an intensity enhancement in the central part of the
sigmoidal ﬂaring area during E3. The latter area is only
faintly detected in co-temporal chromophere and TR, see
e.g., I1400 and A304 maps.

Between the above homologous ﬂaring events, we ob-
served the occurrence of E2, a small-scale brightening
appeared at about 14:08 UT in the left side of the ROI
(panels in the second row of Figure 6) in the form of three
elongated small-scale features seen in the A304 and A131
data, and only partly detected in I1400 observations.
These bright patches were clearly aligned to penumbral
ﬁlaments and co-spatial to the small-scale positive ﬂux
features described in Section 3.1.

We further investigated the diﬀerences among E1, E2,
and E3 by using I1400 observations, some examples of
which are shown in Figure 7. The evolution of E1 was
fast (Figure 7, top panels) and with simultaneous signa-
tures seen in the light curves and observations of I1400,
A131, and A304. The E2 event lasted about 7 minutes
and reached its maximum extension 3 minutes after its
start (Figure 7, middle panels) in the form of a bright
knot appeared in the penumbra. Three minutes after the
ﬁrst appearance of the bright knot, a thin bright lane con-

measured by GOES -15 in the 1 − 8 ˚A channel. Note the oﬀsets of

The vertical dotted line indicates the starting time of IBIS obser-

Sections 3.2 and 3.3 and shown in Figures 6, 7, and 9. Bottom

than regular Evershed ﬂows nearby (Figure 4 panel c).

Figure 4 (panels d-e) also display ﬁlaments at the at-
mospheric height log τ = −1.0 with average values of the
ﬁeld strength and inclination of about 1.4 kG and about
45◦, respectively, in the area that broke away from the
penumbra, compared to the values for the same quan-
tities of 0.9 kG and 80◦ for the homogeneous ﬁlaments
nearby. Later, e.g., at 17:00 UT, the ﬁeld pattern in the
region was unchanged but for the slightly larger exten-
sion of the in-homogeneous patches.

3.2. Signatures from the chromosphere to the corona
At the chromospheric heights sampled by the IBIS
Ca II 854.2 nm measurements, the ROI showed a bun-
dle of ﬁlaments with intense and repeated brightening
at various locations, especially in the area of the two
EFRs. These small-scale enhancements were observed in
the form of either circular or elongated features (see the
on line animation of the Ca II line core images in Fig-
ure 4). Moreover, at log τ = −4.6 (Figure 4, panels f-g)

nected it to a small bright patch outside the penumbra.
This bright lane became brighter with time and reached
its maximum extension 4 minutes after its ﬁrst appear-
ance. E2 produced the strongest signature in the GOES -
15 X-ray ﬂux record, but only relatively small changes in
the intensity emerging from the low chromosphere to the
upper TR compared to the same atmospheric layers dur-
ing E3. The latter transient produced intensity enhance-
ments whose amplitude increased with the atmospheric
height. E3 started at 14:20 UT, lasted about 13 minutes,
and reached maximum extension (40′′) 11 minutes after
its beginning. The maximum of intensity in the I1400
data occurred 2 minutes later than recorded for all the
SDO /AIA EUV channels.

In Figure 8 we show the Hinode/XRT X-ray intensity
maps acquired during the maximum brightening of E1,
E2 and E3 events (second column), as well as one minute
before (ﬁrst column) and after (third column) the three
events. These images display the same plasma behaviour
as reported in A131 and the strongest coronal brighten-
ing observed during E3 too. In particular, the shape of
the E2 brightening (panels b) indicates the possible con-
nection between opposite polarity parches of the diﬀuse
ﬁeld and MMF.

3.3. IRIS spectra
The IRIS slit sampled the region at X=[41′′]. We show
in Figure 9 examples of the line proﬁles measured during
E1 and E3 at the positions marked by the symbols in

Figure 7 in both the inhomogenous and regular penum-
bra. From a comparison with Figure 6, we can note
that the positions marked with triangles correspond to
the eastern footpoints of the ﬂaring loop during both E1
and E3. The red curves represent the spectra measured
at the time of maximum brightening of each event. Un-
fortunately, there are no similar data available for E2.

During the transients, the C II and Si IV line pro-
ﬁles, which are formed in the TR, were enhanced by a
factor of about 10 with respect to the line proﬁles mea-
sured in the quiet penumbral region (black curves), taken
as a reference. At the time of maximum brightening
red curves, the double-peaked C II proﬁles showed blue
lobes stronger than the red ones.
In addition, the red
wings of the C II intensity proﬁles were broader than the
blue wings. The C II proﬁles showed asymmetric peaks
varying in time, speciﬁcally the red lobe stronger than
the blue one during the initial stages (blue curve) of the
brightening, and opposite peak ranking at the time of
maximum brightening (red curve). However, during E3
the C II intensity proﬁle (Figure 9, bottom-left panel)
was less asymmetric than reported for E1. The Si IV
line proﬁles during the two events were broadened by a
factor of about 3 with respect to that measured in the ref-
erence regular penumbra, redshifted, indicating plasma
velocities up to about 10km s

−1.

Chromospheric Mg II h&k lines measurements showed
a behaviour similar to C II spectra, since the double-
peaked proﬁles exhibited blue lobes stronger than the

red ones at the peak of the brightening events. More-
over, the emission intensity proﬁles displayed no signif-
icant Doppler shift in all the available data. During
the transients, the emission of the Mg II h&k lines was
enhanced by a factor 2 with respect to that measured
in the regular penumbra. During E1 the proﬁles were
rather symmetric, except for the data taken at maxi-
mum brightening (red curve). Conversely, before the E3
transient the proﬁles displayed red lobes stronger than
the blue ones, contrarily to data during the maximum
brightening (see blue and red curves in the bottom-right
panel of Figure 9).

Noticeably, the Mg II intensity proﬁles measured dur-
ing both E1 and E3 showed emission in the Mg II
2798.8 ˚A triplet (marked by the red arrows in Figure 9).

4. DISCUSSION
We presented our analysis of brightening events ob-
served in the penumbra of AR NOAA 12546. This re-
gion included one among the largest sunspots of the so-
lar cycle 24. The data analyzed in our study consist
of multi-wavelength and multi-instrument measurements
obtained with state-of-the-art facilities, speciﬁcally with
the IBIS, SDO /HMI, SDO /AIA, IRIS and Hinode/XRT
instruments. The bright ﬁlaments and dark spines form-
ing the penumbra were nearly radially aligned over most
of the sunspot structure and during its entire disk pas-
sage, except for a small area at a given time. We analyzed
the phenomena occurring in this small area at represen-
tative times. We found that:

1. A ﬁrst EFR emerged close to the penumbral ﬁeld,

with a ﬂux content of about 3 × 1020 Mx.

2. The newly emerged ﬂux coalesced to pre-existing
network ﬁeld and formed a small pore of opposite
polarity ﬂux with respect to the one in the umbra.

3. Another small EFR occurred in the sunspot moat
with a ﬂux content of about 5 × 1019 Mx. The
negative ﬂux patches from this EFR merged with
the pore formed from the previous EFR.

4. During the emergence of the second EFR, a bright
gap and some dark patches appeared inside the
penumbra, in which the positive polarity of the sec-
ond EFR was embedded. The bright gap separated
ﬁlaments with diﬀerent orientation than the one of
the ﬁlaments nearby.

5. The above photospheric features were preceded by
the formation of elongated patches in the penum-
bra with magnetic ﬁeld inclination ranging from
40◦ to 60◦, diﬀerent with respect to the inclination
of the ﬁeld in the ﬁlaments nearby, of about 60◦-
90◦. These elongated patches also showed plasma
LOS velocity opposite with respect to the regular
Evershed ﬂows nearby.

6. The horizontal plasma ﬂow exhibited two system-
atic velocity patterns directed from the penumbra
towards the ﬁrst EFR and to the southern side of
the ROI. Strong diverging motions with values of
−1
the horizontal plasma velocity of about 1km s
characterized the area of the two EFRs.

11

7. Three brightening events occurred during the
above evolution of the photospheric magnetic en-
vironment, with clear signatures detected from the
chromosphere to the corona. All the events had a
footpoint located in the penumbra.

8. Two of these events were recorded by GOES as B-
class ﬂares. One of these (E3 ) can be also classiﬁed
as an homologous ﬂare (e.g., Romano et al. 2015),
since it showed the same conﬁguration as a previ-
ous ﬂaring event (E1 ). The ﬁrst homologous ﬂaring
event lasted less than the second one. It left simul-
taneous signatures at all the chromospheric, TR,
and coronal analyzed data. The second homolo-
gous event lasted about 13 minutes. The ﬂaring
region of E3 was about 40′′ wide (29 Mm). It is
worth mentioning that another homologous ﬂaring
event was seen in the SDO /AIA ﬁltergrams after
the end of the IRIS observations, at 16:39 UT.

9. IRIS spectra relevant to the penumbral footpoints
during the two homologous ﬂares reveal enhanced
emission and asymmetries in both the C II and
Mg II h&k line proﬁles, and weak emission at the
Mg II 2798.8 ˚A triplet. In particular, at the time
of maximum brightening, the blue lobe proﬁles are
stronger than the red ones.

Observations of AR NOAA 12546 show a large num-
ber of short-living MMFs ﬂowing away from the sunspot,
some of them occurring in the ROI.

Figure 10 displays the evolution of a few MMFs rele-
vant to the transient brightening events described above.
To ease comparison, we overplotted the intensity con-
tours of the studied events on all of the maps in Fig-
ure 10. Close to each footpoint of E1, we note type I
MMFs (zoomed in the inserts in the left and right cor-
ners in Figure 10, panels a, b, c, and d).

The MMF at the eastern side streamed out from the
penumbra. Eventually, at 13:24 UT, i.e. at the time the
E1 occurred, a unipolar feature remained. The MMF at
the western footpoint likely underwent a partial magnetic
cancellation of the positive ﬂux (see panel d in Figure 10),
slightly before E1. After E1, we note two couples of
type I MMFs (see insert in the left corner of Figure 10,
panel e) that disappeared at the time of E3. At the
western footpoint, the negative ﬂux patch from previous
MMF merging was approached by a positive ﬂux feature
leading to a partial magnetic ﬂux cancellation event.

The photospheric structures appeared in the penum-
bra facing the second EFR had vertical magnetic ﬁelds.
In the same region we found a bright gap and diverging
ﬁlaments. We consider these features as the counter-
part of the positive polarity of the EFR, which broke
up the uncombed penumbra. This is likely due to the
interaction of rising magnetic ﬂux elements with the in-
clined magnetic ﬁeld of the penumbra (Ichimoto et al.
2007; Su et al. 2010).

The same regions also exhibited LOS velocity op-
posite to the Evershed ﬂow observed in the penum-
bral ﬁlaments nearby. We consider that these op-
posite ﬂows are a further consequence of the above
Counter Evershed
change in the ﬁeld inclination.

2014; Murabito et al. 2016, 2018), and over stable
penumbrae (Louis et al. 2014; Siu-Tapia et al. 2017).

Lim et al.

(2011) presented observations of

two
granular-like features (GLFs), about 1′′ wide, at the tip
of penumbral ﬁlaments and associated with MMFs. Both
the observed GLFs were preceded by elongated darken-
ing and one of these showed ﬁne structure consisting of
thin, dark and bright threads. The two GLFs revealed
signiﬁcant chromospheric transients, speciﬁcally bright-
ening in Hα and SDO /AIA 1600 ˚A images and jets. The
relatively long-lasting, dark patches we observed in the
penumbra were 5 times wider than reported by the above
authors and showed no threads. Besides, the GLFs found
by Lim et al. (2011) had opposite polarity than the ﬁeld
in the sunspot umbra, whereas the dark structure ob-
served in our region had same polarity of the umbral
ﬁeld.

The brightening observed by Bai et al. (2016), about
10′′ wide, crossed a penumbra. It started at the border
of the penumbra and then elongated towards the umbra,
by leaving signatures detected from the chromosphere to
the corona. The transient events analyzed in this work
diﬀer from the one reported by Bai et al. (2016) mostly
for their larger extension and activation over an area that
included both the penumbra and moat, as well as for
their longer lifetime. Moreover, they do not show any
expansion motion.

IRIS spectroscopic information are relevant to the
eastern footpoints of the events E1 and E3, embedded
in the penumbra. According to Rathore et al. (2015),
IRIS C II intensity proﬁles are a powerful discriminant of
upper chromospheric structures, and their asymmetries
and line shifts are a robust velocity diagnostic. They
showed that the C II spectral proﬁles can have a single
peak or two or more peaks, depending on how the source
function varies with the atmospheric height. They at-
tributed the asymmetry of intensity proﬁles to velocity
gradients between the formation height of the intensity
peaks and of the line core.
In particular, by compar-
ing the intensity proﬁles measured in active and quiet
Sun regions, Rathore et al. (2015) reported line proﬁles
with the blue peak stronger/weaker than the red one
and attributed this proﬁle feature to plasma with down-
ﬂow/upﬂow above the peak formation height.
In our
data, we found: i) the intensity proﬁles measured during
the initial stages of both events with red peaks stronger
than the blue ones, thus revealing plasma upﬂow at the
time of those measurements; ii) at maximum brighten-
ing, intensity proﬁles with blue peaks stronger than red
ones, thus hinting at plasma downﬂow; iii) E1 showed
a stronger asymmetry of the C II intensity proﬁles than
derived from E3 ; iv) the intensity proﬁles measured after
E3 display blue peaks stronger than red ones, whereas
the ones measured after E1 do not clearly show the same
feature.

The C II spectra of the brightening event reported
by Bai et al. (2016) are asymmetric with the red peak
stronger than the blue one, in contrast with the observa-
tions analyzed in our study.

The intensity proﬁles of the chromospheric Mg II h&k
lines measured during E1 and E3 are also double-peaked

but rather symmetric except for the data taken at max-
imum brightening which have blue peaks stronger than
red ones as for plasma downﬂow at the formation height
of the intensity peaks (Leenaarts et al. 2013). Finally,
the width of the intensity proﬁles of the Mg II h&k lines
does not change signiﬁcantly during the studied events as
for a temperature increase associated to the brightening
not occurring in the lower chromosphere (Pereira et al.
2015). It is worth noting that the Mg II 2796.35 ˚A inten-
sity proﬁle presented by Bai et al. (2016) is symmetric
as expected from quiet plasma at the formation height
of the analyzed intensity peak in contrast to our data.

Indeed, we notice that the blue peaks are stronger than
the red ones for both the C II and Mg II h&k lines
data, especially during event E3, which is the stronger
brightening. This asymmetry suggests the occurrence of
chromospheric evaporation at the penumbral footpoints
following a magnetic reconnection process occurring at
higher atmospheric heights, as hypothised by Bai et al.
(2016).

Furthermore, the Mg II intensity proﬁles we measured
during both E1 and E3 show a weak emission of Mg II
2798.8 ˚A triplet. Pereira et al. (2015) attributed this rare
emission to steep temperature increase in the lower chro-
mosphere. The Mg II 2798.8 ˚A emission can involve ei-
ther the far wings or core of the line, depending on the
range of interested column masses.
In particular, the
emission seen in the wings of intensity proﬁle points to
plasma heating occurring deeper down the chromosphere
while that recorded at the line core, which is suggestive of
pure chromospheric heating (Hansteen et al. 2017). Our
data show Mg II 2798.8 ˚A emission in the line core, thus
revealing that E1 and E3 produced a steep temperature
increase at chromospheric heights.

We also considered the results presented above with
respect to the ﬁndings of MHD numerical simulations
of coronal and chromospheric micro-ﬂares performed by
Jiang et al. (2012). In these numerical models the micro-
ﬂares leave diﬀerent atmospheric signatures and have dif-
ferent size depending on the atmospheric height of the
magnetic reconnection episode responsible for the ﬂaring.
In particular, in the case of the simulated coronal micro-
ﬂares, the size of the brightening region ranges from 15′′
to 22′′. The upper atmosphere response to the event sim-
ulated by Jiang et al. (2012) includes both hot plasma
jets (≈ 1.8 × 106 K) observed in the EUV/X-ray bands
and cold jets (≈ 104 K) revealed as Hα/Ca brightening
events. Moreover, the numerical studies indicate a time
delay between the signatures of the reconnection process
seen in the upper and lower atmosphere.
In particu-
lar, the enhanced EUV/X-ray emission was found to ap-
pear before the Hα/Ca brightening. Jiang et al. (2012)
roughly derived an estimate for this time delay. By tak-
ing into account the temperature response at 1500 km
(the height formation of Hα, Vernazza et al. 1981) those
authors reported a time delay of about 3-5 minutes. The
spatial scale of the studied brightening events in their
signatures in the various layers of atmosphere agree with
those reported by the simulation results of Jiang et al.
(2012) for coronal micro-ﬂares.

We have seen that the magnetic conﬁguration analyzed
in Figure 10 for the three penumbral brightening suggest
a clear link between the EFR, MMFs and the pre-existing

penumbral ﬁeld. In regard to the trigger mechanism of
the observed transient events, E1 and E3 seem due to the
interaction between the penumbral ﬁelds and the EFR.
In particular, the outer negative footpoint of the EFR in-
teracts with the MMFs departing from the penumbra, as
suggested in the model proposed by Kano et al. (2010)
(ﬂux emergence case). Moreover, the positive footpoint
of the EFR inside the penumbra also comes into contact
with negative polarities around the penumbra originated
by either MMFs or ﬂux return patches. This interaction
may activate magnetic reconnection events. On the other
hand, E2 seems due to the interplay between MMFs and
the pre-existing diﬀuse ﬁeld to the south of the sunspot,
as suggested by the crossing enhanced connections vis-
ible in the Hinode/XRT images. This is reminiscent of
the model introduced by Kano et al. (2010) (MMFs in-
teraction case). Therefore, for the three studied events
there is a tight distinctive interplay among EFR, MMFs
and pre-existing magnetic ﬂux systems.

5. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we analyzed multi-wavelength observa-
tions of the AR NOAA 12546 obtained with state-of-the-
art instruments to further investigate the trigger mecha-
nism of penumbral brightening events. In particular, we
studied the evolution of the AR penumbral area adja-
cent to two small-scale EFRs emerged in the AR on 2016
May 20. The analyzed region showed three brightening
events detected from the chromosphere to the corona.
From analysis of IBIS, SDO /HMI, SDO /AIA, IRIS, and
Hinode observations we found that two of the studied
events likely derived from reconnection processes oc-
curred at diﬀerent atmospheric heights that were acti-
vated by the interaction of the pre-existing ﬁelds with
either the EFRs or MMFs.

Penumbral transient brightening events have been at-
tributed to magnetic reconnection processes occurring in
the low corona (Bai et al. 2016). The spatial scale of
the events analysed in our study in their signatures in
the atmosphere agree with those reported by the sim-
ulation results of Jiang et al. (2012) for coronal micro-
ﬂares. Moreover, our observations conﬁrm the model
for nano-ﬂare events sketched in Figure 12 of the pa-
per by Kano et al. (2010), both for the ﬂux emergence
and MMFs interaction cases. They also complement the
results presented by Bai et al. (2016) showing the sig-
natures of the chromospheric evaporation following the
ﬂaring events not found by those authors.

We plan to further analyse penumbral brightening
events to understand the role of the less-energetic oc-
currences in the heating of the chromosphere and upper
atmosphere. Spectropolarimetric observations to accu-
rately infer the vector magnetic ﬁeld at diﬀerent heights
in the solar atmosphere, and simultaneous images and
spectra from the photosphere outward, as the ones ex-
pected by the upcoming new generation solar obser-
vatories (DKIST, Tritschler et al. 2015; Solar Orbiter,
M¨uller et al. 2013) are essential to perform these stud-
ies.
