ABSTRACT
A comprehensive study of the physical parameters of active region fan loops is presented using the
observations recorded with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS), the EUV Imaging Spec-
trometer (EIS) on-board Hinode and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The fan loops emerg-
ing from non-ﬂaring AR 11899 (near the disk-center) on 19th November, 2013 are clearly discernible
in AIA 171 ˚A images and those obtained in Fe VIII and Si VII images using EIS. Our measurements
of electron densities reveal that the footpoints of these loops are approximately at constant pressure
with electron densities of log Ne = 10.1 cm−3 at log [T /K] = 5.15 (O IV), and log Ne = 8.9 cm−3
at log [T /K] = 6.15 (Si X). The electron temperature diagnosed across the fan loops by means of
EM-Loci suggest that at the footpoints, there are two temperature components at log [T /K] = 4.95
and 5.95, which are picked-up by IRIS lines and EIS lines respectively. At higher heights, the loops
are nearly isothermal at log [T /K] = 5.95, that remained constant along the loop. The measurement
of Doppler shift using IRIS lines suggests that the plasma at the footpoints of these loops is predomi-
nantly redshifted by 2–3 km s−1 in C II, 10-15 km s−1 in Si IV and 15–20 km s−1 in O IV, reﬂecting
the increase in the speed of downﬂows with increasing temperature from log [T /K] = 4.40 to 5.15.
These observations can be explained by low frequency nanoﬂares or impulsive heating, and provide
further important constraints on the modeling of the dynamics of fan loops.

1. INTRODUCTION
The observations from modern high resolution instru-
ments reveal that active regions comprise a variety of
loop structures. These loops are considered to be the
building blocks of the solar corona. Therefore, a com-
prehensive understanding of the physics of all kinds of
loops is key to the problem of solar coronal heating (see
Klimchuk 2006; Reale 2014; De Moortel & Browning
2015; Klimchuk 2015, for reviews).

Active region loops are broadly classiﬁed into three
categories – namely, hot core loops (3–5 MK), warm
loops (1–2 MK) and fan loops (0.6–1 MK). In addition,
there is a signiﬁcant amount of diﬀuse plasma spread
over a large area at coronal temperatures without any
well-deﬁned visible structures, possibly due to the ab-
sence of instruments with suﬃciently high spatial resolu-
tion (Del Zanna & Mason 2003; Viall & Klimchuk 2011;
Subramanian et al. 2014).

The hot loops are rooted in moss regions (Berger et al.
1999; Antiochos et al. 2003; Tripathi et al. 2010, 2012)
and have electron densities log Ne = 9.58 cm−3 and
9.26 cm−3 for Fe XIV (log [T /K] = 6.30) and Fe XIII
(log [T /K] = 6.25) respectively (Brosius et al. 1997;
Tripathi et al. 2010; Del Zanna 2013). The observations
of hot loops reveals that a range of frequencies of heat-
ing events may be present in the core of active regions
(Warren et al. 2011a; Tripathi et al. 2011; Warren et al.

Electronic address: avyarthana@iucaa.in

2012; Del Zanna et al. 2015). Warm loops are believed
to be multi-stranded structures with electron densities
ranging between log Ne = 8.5 to 9.0 cm−3. Their proper-
ties can be explained by low frequency impulsive heating
(see e.g., Del Zanna & Mason 2003; Warren et al. 2003;
Klimchuk 2006; Tripathi et al. 2009; Ugarte-Urra et al.
2009; Gupta et al. 2015).

The fan loops are possibly the most complex and
longest living loop structures,
formed at the periph-
ery of active regions and were ﬁrst studied in detail by
Schrijver et al. (1999) using the observations recorded by
the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE;
Handy et al. 1999). These are thought to be rooted in
in close proximity to ac-
the penumbrae of sunspots,
in
tive regions with relatively strong magnetic ﬁelds,
enhanced network zones or even in unipolar quiet net-
work regions. Such structures connect regions of large
ﬂux concentration over distances as large as 105 km or
more (Schrijver et al. 1999). While their lifetimes typi-
cally range from several hours to days, the evolution time
scale is a fraction of an hour (Schrijver et al. 1999).

One of the earliest spectroscopic studies of fan loops
was performed by Winebarger et al. (2002) using obser-
vations made with the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements
of Emitted Radiation (SUMER; Wilhelm et al. 1995) on-
board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO).
These fan loops were observed in the emission line of
Ne VIII 770 ˚A (log [T /K] = 5.80) and the plasma in
these loops showed persistent downﬂows (redshifts) of 15-

40 km s−1. We, however, note that the reference wave-
length used to derive the Doppler shift was 770.409 ˚A and
that was revised to 770.428±0.007 ˚A by Peter & Judge
(1999) and to 770.428±0.003 ˚A by Dammasch et al.
(1999) using SUMER observations. The use of the re-
vised wavelength will therefore reduce the Doppler shift
in fan loops computed by Winebarger et al. (2002) by
∼5-10 km s−1. Based on hydrodynamic modelling, the
observed ﬂows were attributed to non-uniform asym-
metric heating of the loops. Later on, Marsch et al.
(2004) studied fan loops observed over three active re-
gions and found Doppler velocities of ∼ ±5 km s−1 for
H I Lyβ 1025 ˚A (log [T /K] = 4.00) and ∼ ±2 km s−1 for
Si II 1533 ˚A (log [T /K] = 4.20). At higher temperatures,
the redshifts increased to ∼ 5 km s−1 in C IV 1548 ˚A
(log [T /K] = 5.05), and ∼ 15 − 20 km s−1 in the spec-
tral lines of both N V 1548 ˚A and O VI 1031 ˚A formed
at log [T /K] = 5.30 and 5.45 respectively. However, the
redshift decreased to ∼ 10 km s−1 in the spectral line of
Ne VIII 770 ˚A. However, Doschek (2006) reported that
the plasma ﬂowing along the ﬁeld lines in these fan loops
was blueshifted by 5-10 km s−1 in Ne VIII 770 ˚A and
S V 786 ˚A (log [T /K] = 5.20) lines.

With the launch of the EUV Imaging Spectrome-
ter (EIS; Culhane et al. 2007) on-board Hinode, the
measurements of physical parameters such as electron
densities, temperatures and Doppler shifts in various
structures within a temperature span from the upper
transition region to the corona have been routinely
performed (see e.g., Mariska et al. 2008; Del Zanna
2008; Doschek et al. 2008; Tripathi et al. 2009, 2012;
Dadashi et al. 2012; Winebarger et al. 2013). Doppler
shifts of the plasma conﬁned in fan loops were mea-
sured using EIS observations by Warren et al. (2011b)
and Young et al. (2012). Warren et al. (2011b) showed
that the plasma at the footpoints of fan loops was red-
shifted by ∼ 30 km s−1 in Si VII (log [T /K] = 5.80) line
and also suggested, based on magnetic ﬁeld extrapola-
tion, that fan loops are closed loop structures, though
the other footpoints may not be visible in coronal im-
ages. Young et al. (2012) reported that plasma in the fan
loops was redshifted (∼ 15 − 20 km s−1) in Fe VIII line
at log [T /K] = 5.80, but were blueshifted (∼ 25 km s−1)
in the emission lines of Fe XII (above log [T /K] = 6.20)
at their footpoints. At intermediate temperatures (Fe X
line, log [T /K] = 6.00), they observed mixed signatures
of downﬂows and upﬂows.

The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS;
De Pontieu et al. 2014), which was launched in 2013,
when combined with the EIS, provides a remarkable
opportunity to study the various physical plasma pa-
rameters in the solar atmosphere all the way from

2. OBSERVATIONS
The analysed active region (AR 11899) appeared on
the east limb of the Sun on November 12, 2013 and was
observed at heliographic coordinates of 284W, 31N on
the 19th of November, 2013. On that date, this active re-
gion was observed nearly simultaneously by Hinode/EIS,
IRIS, SDO/AIA & HMI. Figure 1 (A) displays the full-
disk AIA image taken with the 171 ˚A channel. The over-
plotted black box is the EIS raster ﬁeld-of-view (FOV)
for CCD B, the blue box is the IRIS Slit-Jaw Image (SJI)
FOV and the green box is the IRIS raster FOV. The
red box in ﬁgure 1(A) is the region highlighted in ﬁgure
1(B) showing the fan loops in detail. The EIS raster im-
ages of the active region using two emission lines (Si VII
275.35 ˚A at log [T /K] = 5.80 and Fe XII 195.12 ˚A at
log [T /K] = 6.20) are plotted in ﬁgures 1 (C) & (D).
The maps in ﬁgures 1 (B), (C) & (D) are plotted using
a negative intensity scale. The gaps in Figures 1 (C)
& (D) between x= [228′′,292′′] are caused by missing
data in the EIS raster. Henceforth, this region has been
neglected in our analysis. The blue and green boxes on
these EIS intensity maps show the FOV of IRIS SJI and
raster respectively. However, in all the later ﬁgures, the
IRIS raster FOV have been reduced so as to focus on the
footpoint region only.

To determine the plasma densities and temperatures
in the fan loops, spectroscopic data from IRIS and EIS
have been utilised. For Doppler velocities, however, only
IRIS observations are used. For this particular obser-
vation, EIS used the 2′′ slit to raster over 150 positions
(i.e. time-steps) between 10:40:20 UT and 11:59:00 UT
with an exposure of ∼30 seconds so that the EIS FOV is
[300′′,300′′]. IRIS rastered a FOV of [20′′,182′′] six times
over a period of ∼ 32 minutes (between 10:31:15 UT
and 11:03:31 UT). Each raster is 5 minutes and 17 sec-
onds long. The spectral lines, from IRIS as well as EIS,
used for this study are listed in Table 1, along with their
laboratory wavelengths taken from Sandlin et al. (1986)
for IRIS lines & from Brown et al. (2008) for EIS lines.
Note that the reference wavelength for Si VII mentioned
in Brown et al. (2008) should be corrected to 275.368 ˚A
(see Warren et al. 2011b). The peak formation tempera-
tures have been taken from CHIANTI (Dere et al. 1996;
Landi et al. 2013).

In this study we have used level-2 data from IRIS and
level-0 data from EIS. The IRIS data are corrected for
all instrumental eﬀects such as ﬂat-ﬁelding, dark currents
and oﬀsets, so as to make them suitable for all scientiﬁc
purposes1 including the thermal orbit variations. Also,
during the length of each raster of 5 minutes 17 seconds
long, the orbital error should be negligible. However,
we estimated the residual orbital variations for a single
raster as well as over the entire duration of the six rasters
and concluded that it is negligible. The IRIS data are
analysed using Gaussian ﬁtting routines provided in so-
larsoft2. EIS level-0 data have been pre-processed with

moved using a double Gaussian ﬁt. The Fe XII line at
195.12 ˚A has a self-blend at 195.18 ˚A, but its contribu-
tion is negligible (<10%) in regions with densities lower
than log Ne = 9.5 cm−3 at log [T /K] = 6.20. Therefore,
ﬁtting a single Gaussian suﬃces.

In this study we have data in two IRIS spectral win-
dows, namely C II and Si IV. Within the C II win-
dow there are two C II lines at 1334.5 ˚A & 1335.71 ˚A
(log [T /K] = 4.40), but the signal strength is poor for
both of them. Hence, a 4 × 4 pixel binning is performed.
The Si IV window harbours two lines at 1394.78 ˚A and
1402.77 ˚A (log [T /K] = 4.90). The Si IV window cen-
tered at 1402.77 ˚A also has two O IV lines observed
at 1399.77 ˚A and 1401.16 ˚A (log [T /K] = 5.15). For
the O IV lines, due to poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
a 4 × 4 pixel binning is required. These two lines of
O IV are density sensitive and are used for the mea-
surement of electron densities under the assumption of a
Maxwellian distribution of electron velocities (see how-
ever, Dud´ık et al. 2011).

For the EIS spectral analysis (see Table 1), we use lines
from Fe VIII (log [T /K] = 5.65) to Fe XIV (log [T /K] =
6.30). The Fe VIII 194.66 ˚A line has a blend in its
red wing, at 194.80 ˚A (Young et al. 2007), which is re-

One important aspect of measuring the Doppler shifts
is to determine a reference wavelength. Generally, neu-
tral or singly ionized photospheric or chromospheric lines
serve the purpose of determining the in-ﬂight absolute
wavelength drift (Hassler et al. 1991) when there are no
calibration lamps on-board5. IRIS has a S I line with a
rest wavelength of 1401.5136 ˚A (De Pontieu et al. 2014).
The observed wavelength of the same S I line is 1401.52 ˚A
(averaged over the entire raster) which translates to a ve-
locity diﬀerence of ∼1.0 km s−1. This line is used for the
absolute wavelength calibration of all IRIS lines. For the
EIS instrument, however, there are no neutral spectral
lines or on-board calibration lamp. A method to obtain
absolute velocities from EIS was derived by Young et al.
(2012) that used quiet Sun region in Fe VIII line to ob-
tain the reference wavelength. Unfortunately, in our ob-
servations, no such region could be identiﬁed. Hence, we
have not attempted to derive Doppler velocities using

Our aim is to study the various physical parameters
of the plasma within the fan loops using IRIS and EIS.
Therefore, we need to co-align the EIS and IRIS images.
Since AIA gives full-disk images at diﬀerent tempera-
tures, these can be used as references to co-align the IRIS
and EIS observations. For this purpose, ﬁrstly the IRIS
raster obtained in Si IV 1402.77 ˚A (plotted in contours
in ﬁgure 2(A)) is over-plotted on an IRIS Slit Jaw Im-
age (SJI) taken in Si IV 1400 ˚A (the reference image in
(Figure 2(A))) to check for any misalignment. The Si IV
SJI is then co-aligned with 1600 ˚A images taken by AIA
(Figure 2(B)). This is followed by co-aligned images of
AIA 171 ˚A channel on IRIS Si IV 1400 ˚A SJI (Figure
2(C))) in background. Furthermore, AIA 171 ˚A chan-
nel image has been co-aligned with AIA 1600 ˚A image.
The raster image obtained in EIS Fe VIII was co-aligned
with AIA images taken at 171 ˚A. Figure 2 displays the
co-aligned IRIS, EIS and AIA images.

3. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
In Figure 3, the 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A images corre-
spond to near-continuum, which show the sunspot umbra
fringed by the penumbra and scattered bright plage. The
304 ˚A channel primarily corresponds to the emission in
the He II line that shows the sunspot (which does not
appear dark in this channel) and the active region in
the hottest part of the chromosphere (log [T /K] = 4.70).
The images in the second and third rows of the Figure 3
(D-H) display the morphology of the fan loops emanating
from the sunspot at diﬀerent characteristic temperatures.
Figure 3(I) shows the line of sight (LOS) magnetogram.
The magnetogram clearly indicates a bright region, cor-
responding to apparent opposite polarity ﬁeld within the
sunspot umbra, although this may well be a location of
anomalous polarisation rather than true opposite polar-
ity.

As can be seen in Figure 3, the fan loops are seen in
almost all the channels of AIA. This is essentially due
to the fact that all the channels have some contribu-
tion from low temperature lines forming below a million
degrees (see e.g., O’Dwyer et al. 2010, for more detail).
The fan loops are most prominent in the image taken
in the AIA 171 ˚A channel at log [T /K] = 5.80. As the

temperature rises further, the loops become less and less
perceptible. A similar eﬀect was observationally seen for
the warm loops by Tripathi et al. (2009) and modelled
by Guarrasi et al. (2010). However, the 131 ˚A channel
of AIA has a signiﬁcant contribution from the Fe VIII line
formed at log [T /K] = 5.60. This Fe VIII line emission
actually exhibits itself as the very bright loops emanating
from the footpoint region even in the 131 ˚A channel. The
94 ˚A channel has contributions from several transitions of
Fe X and Fe XIV formed over a wide temperature range
(Del Zanna et al. 2012). The intermediate temperature
channels, 193 and 211 ˚A show gradual fading of the loops
in the background whereas the cores are still visible. Ex-
amining the intensity maps obtained using EIS lines over
a range of temperatures (log [T /K] = 5.65 to 6.30) show
that the loops are clearly discernible in the lower temper-
ature lines and gradually fade at higher temperatures.

In order to have a clear understanding of the location
of footpoints of fan loops with respect to the sunspot, in
the left panel of Figure 4 we show the HMI continuum im-
age over-plotted with blue contours of fan loops obtained
from AIA 171 ˚A. The yellow (level = 22000) and black
(levels=55000) contours demarcate the boundary of um-
bra and penumbra of the sunspot respectively. The mid-
dle panel shows IRIS 1400 ˚A slit-jaw image over-plotted
with same contours as in left panel. The overlying cyan
box indicates the IRIS raster FOV (reduced along y-
direction). The right panel image shows AIA 171˚A im-
age over-plotted with B-ﬁeld contours of level -1200 G,
demarcating the big sunspot as well as the anomalous
polarity region inside the umbra. As can be inferred
from the images, the fan loops are rooted well inside
the umbra, exactly at the location where sunspot shows
anomalous behaviour. Additionally, the footpoints ap-
pear brighter in the IRIS Si IV 1400 ˚A slit-jaw image. We
have checked for the HMI magnetogram data and found
that the region with anomalous magnetic ﬁeld persisted
over few days. So did the fan loops.

Since we are interested in quiescent AR fan loops, it
is important to demonstrate that the structures do not
show any signiﬁcant change during the time of the ob-
servations. Therefore, we look at the light curves along
the fan loops and check for their stability over time. The

fan loops emerging from the sunspot region in the AIA
171 ˚A channel and the corresponding variation of inten-
sity along a loop over the entire duration of all six rasters
of IRIS (∼32 minutes between 10:31:15 UT and 11:03:07
UT) shows that the maximum ﬂuctuation over the entire
period is < 4%, near the apex. However, the ﬂuctua-
tions closer to the footpoints are smaller. Note that the
ﬂuctuations are computed as the diﬀerence of maximum
and minimum intensities over the mean intensity over all
the six rasters.
It is emphasized that no treatment of
background/foreground intensities was performed. Ac-
cording to L´opez Fuentes & Klimchuk (2015), any small
intensity ﬂuctuation in loops could be attributed to the
background/foreground contribution. From the tempo-
ral evolution plot as well as visual inspection of the IRIS
and AIA movies, we are conﬁdent that there has been
no major eruptive event within this duration that could
produce such foreground/background changes.

3.1. Measurement of Electron Density
Using the density sensitive line pairs of O IV (IRIS)
(1399.77 ˚A and 1401.16 ˚A formed at log [T /K] = 5.15)
and Si X (EIS) (258.37 ˚A and 261.04 ˚A formed at
log [T /K] = 6.15), we have determined the electron den-
sities at the footpoints and in the fan loops.

The aim is to compute the average electron density
at the footpoint of fan loops, denoted by box E (5.6′′x

17.84′′) in all three panels of Figure 5. Figure 5 provides
the two intensity maps obtained for O IV lines (left and
middle panel) and the derived density map (right panel).
Note that the FOV in the y-direction has been reduced
so as to zoom into the footpoints in all the IRIS maps
shown in the paper. O IV lines, being weak have ﬁtting
problems at pixels with poor counts. In order to improve
the SNR, we binned the data by 4 × 4 pixels.

In order to scrutinise the goodness of the ﬁts, we ran-
domly pick six small regions (e.g., A-D (at the footpoints)
and F & G (away from footpoints), each being 0.66′′×
0.83′′shown in Figure 5) scattered over the IRIS raster
FOV. The ﬁtting has worked very well in the footpoint
regions (i.e., in regions A-D) but not in the other regions
(i.e.
in F and G). In addition, we have worked out the
average density in fan loops by considering a bigger box

Images of AR 11899 on 19-Nov-2013 in the 8 AIA/SDO channels in order of increasing temperature and a HMI LOS magne-

(A-D) and the big box (E) are given in Table 2. Including
the three factors that incorporate errors in the density
estimation - photon count error, ﬁtting error and atomic
data errors, we reckon that the total uncertainty in the
measurement should not exceed 20% of the estimated
values. On an average, the density at the footpoints of
the fan loops within box E is estimated to be log Ne ∼
10.1 cm−3. For the boxes A to E, shown in Figure 5,
we have also estimated the electron densities using the
Si X line pair observed by EIS. Note that the data for the
Si X lines have been binned by 4 pixels in the y-direction
in order to increase the SNR. The densities obtained are
also listed in Table 2.

The values of electron densities given in Table 2 reveal
that the densities measured using Si X at log [T /K] =
6.15 is lower than those measured using O IV at
log [T /K] = 5.15. This is suggestive of constant pressure
at the footpoints of fan loops. In addition, it also sug-
gests that there are probably a number of coronal strands
within the volume where these densities are measured.
The plasma in some of these strands is at log [T /K] =
5.15 and for some others is at log [T /K] = 6.15. This
could be better conﬁrmed by estimating the spectro-
scopic ﬁlling factor (Cargill & Klimchuk 1997) that re-
quires the structures to be resolved,
for example as
in Tripathi et al. (2009); Gupta et al. (2015). Unfortu-
nately, the structures at the footpoints in the present
study are not very well resolved, which prohibited us

from doing such estimates. We further note that due to
poor counts, the estimate of Si X densities likely suﬀers
from a large uncertainty and may be considered as an
upper limit.

3.2. Temperature structure of fan loops

Since we have

fan loop observations across a
range of temperatures, we have produced EM-Loci
(Jordan & Wilson 1971; Del Zanna et al. 2002) plots for
four loop structures (loops I, II, III and IV as indicated
in Figure 6) in order to follow the temperature structure
along the loop length. Several small boxes (A-V, each
3′′x 4′′) have been identiﬁed on these loops. The number-
ing with capital letters identify the regions on the loops
whereas the numbering with small letters indicates the
respective background/foreground. A radiometric cali-
bration has been performed on the IRIS spectral data
using the IRIS software6. For the calculation of the con-
tribution function, photospheric abundances7 and ion-
ization equilibrium8 given by CHIANTI (v7.1.3) spectral
synthesis package are used (Dere et al. 1996; Landi et al.
2013).

We have obtained the EM-Loci curves for all the four
loops (Figure 6) but shown in Figure 7 the EM-Loci plot

for loop II only. We emphasise here that the other loops
provide very similar results. They are not shown here for
brevity. The boxes far away from the footpoints have no
signatures of the low temperature lines (Si IV and O IV)
observed by IRIS. The IRIS lines are available only at
the ﬁrst three locations (ﬁrst three panels, upper row).
Each panel corresponds to a pair of locations (indicated
at the top of each panel). The intensity within the region
denoted by the capital letter represent the loop whereas
the region denoted by the corresponding small letter is
considered as the background/foreground. The lines to
which the plotted curves correspond to are labelled in
the second panel of the bottom row. From Figure 7, we
note that closer to the footpoints, the EM-Loci curves for
the IRIS lines intersect at one point (log [T /K] ∼ 4.95)
and those for the EIS spectral lines intersect at another
point (log [T /K] ∼ 5.95). This diﬀerence between IRIS
and EIS could be due to EIS and IRIS cross-calibration.
However, the diﬀerence is rather too large to be explained
just by considering cross calibration. Another possibility
could be that the plasma in the fan loops has two tem-
perature components – a cooler component (seen by IRIS
lines) and another, warmer component (observed by EIS
lines) – at the footpoints. Considering the fact that we
have obtained two diﬀerent values of electron densities at
two temperatures in the previous section, the existence
of two plasma components seems more likely.

At the bottom of each panel, the histograms are shown
which indicate the number of crossings in each temper-
ature bin of width log [T /M K] = 0.1. We have de-
ﬁned that the formation temperature of the fan loops

is the middle point of the temperature bin where at least
four such crossings are present. Going by that conven-
tion, it is noted that the maximum number of lines cross
within the bin log [T /K] = 5.90 to 6.00 at all the six
locations of loop II i.e. the temperature of fan loops is
log [T /K] = 5.95, which is similar to the values obtained
by Brooks et al. (2011). The errors are estimated to be
one bin on either side of the bin with maximum number
of crossings. The plots also reveal that the temperature
remains almost constant at log [T /K] ∼ 5.90 to 6.0 along
the lengths of the loops. From the AIA and EIS intensity
maps (Figure 3), it is seen that the loops are most promi-
nent in the AIA 171 ˚A channel and in the Fe VIII and
Si VII spectral lines (all of these have a peak formation
temperature around log [T /K] = 5.80). This supports
the deduced temperatures.

3.3. Measurement of Doppler Shift
The IRIS spectral data provides us with an oppor-
tunity to study the plasma ﬂows at the footpoints of
fan loops at transition region temperatures (log [T /K] =
4.40 to 5.15). Here, we have obtained the intensity and
velocity maps in the C II (log [T /K] = 4.40), Si IV
(log [T /K] = 4.90) and O IV (log [T /K] = 5.15) lines ob-
served by an IRIS raster commencing at 10:31:15 UT. It
is known that C II lines may show double peaked proﬁles
at certain locations (Rathore et al. 2015). Our analysis
of the line proﬁles of C II lines at the footpoint of fan
loops suggest that they could be well represented by a
single Gaussian. We note here that there are two lines
for C II, two for Si IV and two for O IV as mentioned

Intensities in the two O IV lines of IRIS formed at log [T /K] = 5.15 (left and middle panel) and density (right panel) map

similar.

The intensity and corresponding Doppler maps for the
IRIS lines are shown in Figure 8. Note that the intensity
maps are shown in negative. Since the C II and O IV
lines are weak, these have been binned over 4 × 4 pix-
els. The footpoints of the fan loops are clearly visible in
Si IV as well as in O IV lines and are predominantly red-
shifted. The redshift is weakest in C II (∼2–3 km s−1)
with a peak formation temperature at log [T /K] = 4.40.
With increasing temperature it increases to about 10-
15 km s−1 in Si IV (log [T /K] = 4.90) and further in-
creases to 15–20 km s−1 in O IV (log [T /K] = 5.15).
Note that the average errors in these measurements are
about 3 km s−1.

The footpoint region has been rastered by IRIS six
times over a period of ∼32 minutes. This provided us
with an opportunity to study the variation of Doppler
shifts in IRIS lines as a function of time. We have chosen
a region, which covered the entire footpoint to study the
variation of the average Doppler shift. It is seen that the
velocities are relatively stable with a tendency towards a
decreasing strength of downﬂows.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have studied the plasma parame-
ters of fan loops (at the footpoints as well as along the
loops) using observations recorded by IRIS, EIS and AIA.
The spectroscopic observations were used to measure the
parameters (electron density, temperature and Doppler
shifts), whereas the high cadence imaging observations

provided by AIA were used to make sure that the loops
were not evolving drastically during the course of the
IRIS and EIS raster observation. In addition, AIA data
were used to coalign the observations from IRIS and EIS.
The fan loops are observed at near-simultaneous times
by AIA, EIS and IRIS. The footpoints of fan loops are
seen at both chromospheric and transition region temper-
atures covering log [T /K] = 4.90 to 5.15. At upper tran-
sition region temperatures (log [T /K] = 5.65 and 5.80),
the main body of the loops are distinctly visible. They
emanate from the footpoints rooted inside the umbra of a
sunspot and end at an unknown location far away (Fig-
ure 3). They become somewhat less discernible (more
diﬀuse) as temperature increases, similar to warm loops
(Tripathi et al. 2009; Guarrasi et al. 2010). We empha-
sise here that the footpoint, which is rooted inside the
umbra of the sunspot, shows anomalous behaviour in
magnetic ﬁeld measurements.

Below we have summarised the main results obtained

in this study:

1. Electron densities in various regions at the foot-
points of the fan loops are measured using the den-
sity sensitive line pairs of O IV (log [T /K] = 5.15)
and Si X (log [T /K] = 6.15) observed with IRIS
and EIS respectively. The average electron density
at the footpoints of fan loops is log Ne = 10.1 cm−3
for O IV and log Ne = 8.9 cm−3 for Si X.

2. The temperature structure in the loops (cross-ﬁeld
as well as along the loops) was studied using the

5.15) lines observed with IRIS. The images have been arranged in
order of increasing temperature. The C II and O IV lines have
been 4x4 pixel binned to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

EM-Loci of the spectral lines observed both with
IRIS and EIS. For this purpose, various locations
along four diﬀerent loops were selected. The loca-
tions adjacent to the loops were considered as the
background (see Figure 6). The IRIS lines are only
visible close to the footpoints of the loops. Based
on these measurements, we ﬁnd that there are two
components of the plasma (at the footpoints the av-
erage temperature from IRIS lines is log [T /K] ∼
4.95 and from EIS lines it is log [T /K] ∼ 5.95) and
remains constant thereafter. In the upper part of
the loops, the EM loci curves from EIS suggest
that all four loops studied are mildly multi-thermal
across the line-of-sight around log [T /K] = 5.95.

3. The Doppler velocities of the plasma at the foot-
points of fan loops are studied using spectral data
from IRIS in C II (log [T /K] = 4.40), Si
IV
(log [T /K] = 4.90) and O IV (log [T /K] = 5.15). In
all these lines the plasma inside the fan loops is pre-
dominantly redshifted (downﬂow) by 2–3 km s−1,
10–15 km s−1 and 15–20 km s−1 respectively
and that it increases with increasing temperature,
within the observed temperature range. We further
note that the observed redshifts at the footpoints
persist for a span of more than 30 minutes.

Our measurements of electron densities being higher at
lower temperatures and vice-versa suggest that the fan
loops are at constant pressure. It further suggests that
the loops are comprised of several loop strands within
the volume being studied. This is further veriﬁed by the
temperature structure obtained using EM-loci analysis
that shows that there are two component plasmas at the
footpoints, one being detected in cooler lines observed by
IRIS and other by EIS lines. The Doppler measurement
also show that there is plasma at the temperature which
is detected by the temperature analysis. Unfortunately,
we did not have good enough wavelength calibration to
derive velocities at higher temperatures using EIS lines.
A comprehensive understanding of the physical param-
eters provides important constraints on the modelling of
active region loops. In addition, the observed patterns
of density, temperature and ﬂows can be compared with

are two mechanisms put forward to explain the heat-
ing of active region loops - i.e. high frequency nanoﬂares
(steady heating where thermal conduction ﬂux is eventu-
ally balanced by the radiative output) and low frequency
nanoﬂares (impulsive heating) where the enthalpy ﬂux
(see e.g., Bradshaw & Cargill 2010) from the corona is
maintained by the radiative cooling. The high and low
frequency scenarios are deﬁned as how frequently the
heating occurs as compared to the time taken for the
cooling of the loops, once a heating event has taken
place. If this interval between two consecutive heating
events is small as compared to the cooling time then
it is deﬁned as high-frequency heating, thereby allow-
ing a minimum loss of energy between those two events
(for further explanation see e.g.,Tripathi et al. (2011)).
The observational signatures for high frequency heat-
ing are: narrow EM distributions (i.e. isothermal cross-
ﬁeld structures) and no Doppler motion unless the loops
are asymmetric (Boris & Mariska 1982; Mariska & Boris

1983; Marsch et al. 2004). For low frequency heating, the
signatures are instead multi-thermal structures across
the loops coupled with Doppler motions. However, the
width of the EM curve can vary depending on the na-
ture of nanoﬂare storms for impulsive heating (Klimchuk
2006; Cargill 2014).

At the footpoint of fan loops our observations show
that the plasma is at least a two component thermal
structure. At greater heights the temperature across
the loops becomes mildly multi-thermal. At the fan
loop footpoints, the plasma is predominantly redshifted,
that increases with increasing temperature within the
observed temperature range (log [T /K] = 4.40 to 5.15).
The observed temperature structures and Doppler pat-
terns are in agreement with the prediction from low fre-
quency nanoﬂares and point towards the interpretation
that the fan loops are heated via impulsive heating mech-
anism. However, this is entirely valid only if the loops are
symmetric. In the case of asymmetric loops, there tend
to be Doppler motions in the plasma due to diﬀerences in
pressure as was shown by Mariska & Boris (1983). How-
ever, the Doppler shifts introduced due such asymmetries
are way smaller (∼ 4–5 km s−1) than those observed in
the current study (15–20 km s−1). Therefore, it is plau-
sible to rule out that the ﬂows that are being observed
here is entirely due to the geometrical asymmetries.

One of the most important inferences of impulsive
heating mechanism is that the plasma goes through suf-
ﬁcient cooling and draining before getting re-heated, im-
plying that all the plasma that leaves the corona must
pass through a range of transition region temperatures
(see Cargill 1994). For a loop having constant pressure
with time and that goes through cooling, Cargill (1994)
showed that the speed of the plasma ﬂow in the transi-
tion region can be approximated as VT ∼ TT
L
τr , where
Tc
TT and Tc are the transition region and coronal temper-
atures respectively, L is the loop half length and τr is the
radiative cooling time. For a projected loop half length
of ∼100 Mm (as estimated in the current study), and
a typical radiative cooling time of 500–2000 s, we ﬁnd
that for a coronal temperature of log [T /K] = 5.95 (as
deduced from EM-Loci analysis), the Doppler shifts in
the spectral lines of C II, Si IV and O IV should be in the
range 1.5–5.5 (observed values are 2-3) km s−1, 4.5–18
(observed values are 10-15) km s−1 and 8–31 (observed
values are 15-20) km s−1 respectively. These values are
within the observed limits in the current study. More
such observations and further modelling are required to
reach a ﬁrm conclusion. The results obtained here pro-
vides further constraints and inputs for modelling of ac-
tive region fan loops.
