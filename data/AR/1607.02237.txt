Solid hulls of weighted Banach spaces of entire
functions.

Jos´e Bonet and Jari Taskinen

Abstract

Given a continuous, radial, rapidly decreasing weight v on the complex
v (C) of all the
plane, we study the solid hull of its associated weighted space H ∞
entire functions f such that v|f | is bounded. The solid hull is found for a large
class of weights satisfying the condition (B) of Lusky. Precise formulations are
obtained for weights of the form v(r) = exp(−arp), a > 0, p > 0. Applications
to spaces of multipliers are included.

Introduction and ﬁrst results.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the solid hull of weighted Banach spaces
v (C) of all entire functions f such that kf kv := supz∈C v(z)|f (z)| is ﬁnite.

its Taylor coeﬃcients (an)∞
in Theorem 3.1 that the solid hull consists precisely of complex sequences (bm)∞
such that

We are also able to characterize in Theorem 2.5, the solid hulls for a quite general
class of weights in terms of numerical sequences deﬁned by Lusky, [18], in his in-
v (C). This class of weights
vestigations of the isomorphic classes of the spaces H ∞
includes those satisfying condition (B) of [18], see Remark 2.7 and Corollary 2.8.
The calculation of the numerical sequences for some important weights v is one of
the results of our paper, see Proposition 3.2. In addition to techniques of [18], our
approach uses the methods of Bennet, Stegenga and Timoney in their paper [2],
v (D) were deter-

our results in Section 2 can be used to determine space of multipliers from H ∞
into ℓp, 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.

The solid hull and multipliers on spaces of analytic functions on the disc has been
investigated by many authors. In addition to [2], we mention here a non exhaustive
sample: [1], [5], [11], [12], [13], [21] and the list of references in [7]. Moreover, the
papers [6], [16] and [20] investigate the behavior of the Taylor coeﬃcients of entire
functions belonging to weighted spaces similar to those considered in this paper.
v (D) appear in the study of growth conditions of
Spaces of type H ∞
analytic functions and have been investigated in various articles since the work of
Shields and Williams, see e.g. [3],[4], [10], [17], [18], [19] and the references therein.
A weight v is a continuous function v : [0, ∞[→]0, ∞[, which is non-increasing
on [0, ∞[ and it is rapidly decreasing, i.e. it satisﬁes limr→∞ rmv(r) = 0 for each
m ∈ N. We extend v to C by v(z) := v(|z|). For such a weight, the weighted Banach
space of entire functions is deﬁned by

v (C) and H ∞

H ∞

v (C) := {f ∈ H(C) : kf kv := supz∈C v(|z|)|f (z)| < ∞},

and it is endowed with the weighted sup norm k·kv. Spaces of this type are also called
sometimes weighted Fock spaces of inﬁnite order. For an entire function f ∈ H(C),
we denote M(f, r) := max{|f (z)| | |z| = r}. Using the notation O and o of Landau,
v (C) if and only if M(f, r) = O(1/v(r)), r → ∞. The symbol N stands for
f ∈ H ∞
the natural numbers n = 1, 2, 3, ....

As we already mentioned, an entire function f (z) =

∞
n=0 anzn is identiﬁed with
the sequence of its Taylor coeﬃcients (an)∞
n=0, that will be also denoted sometimes
by (an)n. As is well-known, it is often impossible to characterize standard Banach
spaces of entire functions in terms of the Taylor coeﬃcients; this is for example true
v (C). The next best thing is to ﬁnd the strongest growth
for the function spaces H ∞
condition that the coeﬃcients have to satisfy. This motivates the concept of a solid
hull, and we now recall the related deﬁnitions and facts from [1].

P

Let A and B be vector spaces of complex sequences containing the space of
all the sequences with ﬁnitely many non-zero coordinates. The space A is solid if
a = (an) ∈ A and |bn| ≤ |an| for each n implies b = (bn) ∈ A. The solid hull of A is

S(A) := {(cn) : ∃(an) ∈ A such that |cn| ≤ |an| ∀n ∈ N}.

The solid core of A is

s(A) := {(cn) : (cnan) ∈ A ∀(an) ∈ ℓ∞}.

The set of multipliers form A into B is

(A, B) := {c = (cn) : (cnan) ∈ B ∀(an) ∈ A}.

Facts: 1. A is solid if and only if ℓ∞ ⊂ (A, A).
2. A ⊂ (B, C) if and only if B ⊂ (A, C).
3. The solid core s(A) of A is the largest solid space contained in A. Moreover
s(A) = (ℓ∞, A).
4. The solid hull S(A) of A is the smallest solid space containing A.
5. If X is solid, (A, X) = (S(A), X) and (X, A) = (X, s(A)).

We conclude this section with our ﬁrst results.

2 The solid hull of H ∞

v (C).
We ﬁx for this section a weight v : C →]0, ∞[ satisfying the general hypothesis made
v (C) for weights
in Section 1. Our next aim is to characterize the solid hull of H ∞
satisfying the additional condition (2.2), below. Let us start by introducing some
notation used in [18].

We denote by [x] be the largest integer less or equal x for a given real number
x ∈ R. Given m > 0, we denote by rm the global maximum point of rmv(r). Then
rm → ∞ as m → ∞. For example, if v(r) = exp(−αrp), then rm = (m/αp)1/p, m >
∞
k=0 akzk, and 0 < m < n (not necessarily
0. Given an entire function f (z) =
integers) we deﬁne the following operators of de la Vall´ee-Poussin type:

Vp,0f :=

[n] − k
[n] − [m]

akzk,

akzk ;

Xm<k≤n
[p] − k

X0≤k≤p

here and later, the summation is performed over integers belonging to the given
intervals, although the endpoints of the intervals need not be integers. We also
denote, for 0 < m < n,

A(m, n) :=

m v(rm)
v(rn)

rm
rn (cid:19)

(cid:18)

and B(m, n) :=

n v(rn)
v(rm)

rn
rm (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

(2.1)

Several results of Lusky, [18], will be needed below. We start with the following

lemma.

Lemma 2.1 ([18], Corollary 3.2 (b)) Let 0 < m < n and let Q(z) =
be a polynomial. Then

m<k≤n akzk

kQkv ≤ 2A(m, n) sup
|z|=rn

|Q(z)|v(z),

kQkv ≤ 2B(m, n) sup
|z|=rm

|Q(z)|v(z).

Given a strictly increasing sequence (mn)∞

n=1 with limn→∞ mn = ∞, we deﬁne
m0 = 0 and Vn := Vmn+1,mn − Vmn,mn−1, n ∈ N. For each n ∈ N, n ≥ 2, Vnf is a
polynomial with all terms of degree at least mn−1 + 1 and at most mn+1, for all
f ∈ H(C). In fact, for each f (z) =

n=0 fnzn ∈ H(C), we have

and

γm =

[mn] − [mn−1]

, mn−1 < m ≤ mn.

The sum in V1f is understood to go from m = 0 to m = m1.

Lemma 2.2 ([18], Prop. 3.4 (b)) If the sequence (mn)n with limn→∞ mn = ∞
satisﬁes

min(A(mn, mn+1), B(mn, mn+1)) ≥ b
for some b > 2, then there is D > 0 such that kVnk ≤ D for each n ∈ N, where k.k

Lemma 2.3 ([18], Lemma 5.1) Fix b > 1. For each weight v : [0, ∞[→]0, ∞[ there
is a sequence of numbers 0 < m1 < m2 < ... with limn→∞ mn = ∞, such that

and

A(mn, mn+1) ≥ b

and B(mn, mn+1) ≥ b

min(A(mn, mn+1), B(mn, mn+1)) < ∞.

sup
n∈N

In fact, Lusky proves in [18, Lemma 5.1] that (mn)n can be selected to sat-
isfy min(A(mn, mn+1), B(mn, mn+1)) = b for each n ∈ N. Our next lemma is
contained in Proposition 5.2 of [18], and its proof in [18] only uses the fact that
min(A(mn, mn+1), B(mn, mn+1)) ≥ b, not that min(A(mn, mn+1), B(mn, mn+1)) = b
for each n ∈ N. (In Remark 3.6 we will be able to clarify, which of these quantities
A or B is larger in the case of the weights exp(−arp).) Accordingly, the following
result holds true, and it contains an important expression for a norm equivalent to
that of H ∞

v (C).

Lemma 2.4 ([18], Proposition 5.2) Let the numbers (mn)∞

where fn := Vnf .

The main result of this section reads as follows.

Theorem 2.5 Let v : C →]0, ∞[ be a weight (which is continuous, radial, non-
increasing on [0, ∞[, and rapidly decreasing). In addition, assume that there exists
a sequence 0 < m1 < m2 < ... with limn→∞ mn = ∞ such that for some b > 2 and
some K ≥ b we have

b ≤ min(A(mn, mn+1), B(mn, mn+1)) ≤ max(A(mn, mn+1), B(mn, mn+1)) ≤ K,

for each n ∈ N. Then, the solid hull of H ∞

Remark 2.6 Notice that if a weight v, as in Theorem 2.5, satisﬁes (2.2), then the
conclusion of Lemma 2.4 also holds. In fact, many important weights do satisfy (2.2),
see Corollary 2.8 and Remark 2.7. Moreover, examples with explicit calculations of
the sequence (mn)n will be presented in Section 3.

Of course, there is no need to extend the condition (2.3) to the ﬁnitely many

coeﬃcients bm, 0 ≤ m ≤ m1.

In the characterization (2.3) we could as well replace rmn by rmn+1. This follows
from the proof below, or as well from the the right hand side inequality in the
assumption (2.2) together with the deﬁnition (2.1). Namely, the condition (2.2)
implies

This means that rm

We estimate ﬁrst the sum from mn to (mn + mn+1)/2. To do this, observe that

Remark 2.7 (1) Lusky introduces the following condition (B) on the weight v in
[18]:

v(rn)

∀b1 > 0 ∃b2 > 1 ∃c > 0 ∀m, n :

≤ b1 and |m − n| ≥ c ⇒

n v(rn)
v(rm)

≤ b2.

(cid:18)

(cid:18)
v (C) is isomorphic to ℓ∞, and
By [18], Theorem 1.1, if v has condition (B), then H ∞
if v does not satisfy condition (B), then H ∞

v (C) is isomorphic to H ∞.

We show that if the weight v satisﬁes condition (B), then for each b > 2 one can
ﬁnd a sequence (mn)n satisfying the assumption (2.2) in Theorem 2.5. Indeed, let
v be a weight satisfying condition (B). Given b > 2 we apply Lemma 2.3 to ﬁnd
a sequence 0 < m1 < m2 < ... with limn→∞ mn = ∞, such that A(mn, mn+1) ≥
b, B(mn, mn+1) ≥ b and M := supn min(A(mn, mn+1), B(mn, mn+1)) < ∞. An in-
spection of the proof of Lemma 5.1 in Lusky shows that we can take in our Lemma 2.3
the sequence (mn)n such that limn→∞(mn+1−mn) = ∞. Set b1 := M, and select b2 >
1 and c > 0 according to condition (B). There is n(0) ∈ N such that mn+1 − mn ≥ c
if n ≥ n(0). Condition (B) now implies that max(A(mn, mn+1), B(mn, mn+1)) ≤
max(M, b2) for each n ≥ n(0). The proof is complete if we take (mn)n≥n(0).

(2) Lusky constructs in [18], Example 2.6, a weight v on C not satisfying condi-
tion (B) such that for a certain sequence (mn) with mn+1−mn = n+1, A(mn, mn+1) =
(n + 1)n+1 and B(mn, mn+1) = 1 for each n ∈ N.

This remark and Examples 2.1–2.2 in [18] imply the following result.

Corollary 2.8 Condition (2.2) is satisﬁed by the following weights:
v(r) = exp(−rp) with p > 0, v(r) = exp(− exp r), and v(r) = exp
where p ≥ 2 and log+ r = max(log r, 0).

Theorem 3.1 is an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.5 and the following
proposition, where we choose b = e. The proposition gives the Lusky numbers
(mn)n for a class of important weights.

Proposition 3.2 Let v(r) = exp(−arp), a > 0, p > 0 and let b > 2. The sequence
mn := p(log b)n2, n ∈ N, satisﬁes, for each n ∈ N, n ≥ 4,

b ≤ A(mn, mn+1) =

Proposition 3.2 implies that the numbers mn can chosen to be n2 for the weight
v(r) = exp(−r) and 2n2 for the weight v(r) = exp(−r2). We give the proof of this
proposition in several steps.

Proof. If 0 < x < 1/2, then

x2/2 ≤ − log(1 − x) − x ≤ x2

(3.2)

This is so since

− log(1 − x) − x = x2/2 + x3/3 + ... ≥ x2/2

and on the other hand,

x2 + log(1 − x) + x = x2/2 − x3/3 − ... ≥ 0.

We now set x := (M − m)/M. Clearly 0 < x < 1/2, 1 − x = m/M and m − M =
−Mx. Hence

M(− log(1 − x) − x) = −M log(m/M) + m − M

and (3.2) implies Mx2/2 ≤ −M log(1 − x) − Mx ≤ Mx2, or,

Proof. We have for 0 < x < 3/4

log(1 + x) − x = −x2/2 + x3/3 − x4/4 + ... ≥ −x2/2.

and

−x2/4 − log(1 + x) + x = x2/4 − x3/3 + x4/4 + ... ≥ x2(1/4 − x/3) > 0.

Hence, for these x,

Fix 0 < m < M < 7m/4. Set x := M/m − 1 so that 0 < x < 3/4. We have

− x2/2 ≤ log(1 + x) − x ≤ −x2/4.

−m(log(1 + x) − x) = m log(m/M) + M − m,

Proof. Set, for n ≥ 4, m := αn2 and M := α(n + 1)2. Then M − m = α(2n + 1)
and M < 7m/4 < 2m. It is now easy to see that

4α ≤

The conclusion follows from Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4.

✷

Proof. of Proposition 3.2.
rm = (m/ap)1/p, and v(rm) = exp(−m/p) for each m ∈ N. Therefore

In this case the maximum point rm of rmv(r) is

A(mn, mn+1)p =

exp(mn+1 − mn),

and

B(mn, mn+1)p =

exp(mn − mn+1).

We apply Lemma 3.5 for α := p(log b) to conclude

bp = exp(α) ≤ A(mn, mn+1)p ≤ exp(9α/4) = b9p/4,

and

bp = exp(α) ≤ B(mn, mn+1)p ≤ exp(4α) = b4p.

This implies the inequalities in the statement.

Remark 3.6 In view of Lemmas 2.1–2.3 it is of interest to compare the expressions
A(m, n) and B(m, n). Let us show here that

A(mn, mn+1) ≤ B(mn, mn+1) (∗)

for v(r) = exp(−arp) and mn = αn2, α > 0. It is enough to do the calculation for
mn = n2. In this case we have

The logarithm of the expression in the last large parenthesis is of the form

where x > 1 and 0 < r < 1. This expression is positive, since log is a concave
function on [0, ∞[. Hence, (3.5) is larger than 1.

4 The space of multipliers (H ∞

v (C), ℓp).

In this ﬁnal section we show that the above results can be applied to determine some
multiplier spaces. Recall that if A and B are vector spaces of complex sequences
containing the space of all the sequences with ﬁnitely many non-zero coordinates,
then the set of multipliers from A into B is

(A, B) := {c = (cn) : (cnan) ∈ B ∀(an) ∈ A}.

Given a strictly increasing, unbounded sequence J = (mn)∞

n=0 ⊂ N and 1 ≤

p, q ≤ ∞ we denote as in [8], Deﬁnition 2,

ℓJ (p, q) :=

m=0 :

,

(4.1)

(cid:16)
with the obvious changes when p or q is ∞. The space ℓJ (p, q) is a Banach space
when endowed with the canonically deﬁned norm. Observe that ℓJ (p, p) = ℓp.
