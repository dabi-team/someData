ABSTRACT

Magnetohydrodynamics of the solar corona is simulated numerically. The
simulation is initialized with an extrapolated non-force-free magnetic ﬁeld us-
ing the vector magnetogram of the active region (AR) NOAA 12192 obtained
on the solar photosphere. Particularly, we focus on the magnetic reconnections
occurring close to a magnetic null-point that resulted in appearance of circular
chromospheric ﬂare ribbons on October 24, 2014 around 21:21 UT, after peak
of an X3.1 ﬂare. The extrapolated ﬁeld lines show the presence of the three-
dimensional (3D) null near one of the polarity inversion lines—where the ﬂare
was observed. In the subsequent numerical simulation, we ﬁnd magnetic recon-
nections occurring near the null point, where the magnetic ﬁeld lines from the
fan-plane of the 3D null form a X-type conﬁguration with underlying arcade ﬁeld
lines. The footpoints of the dome-shaped ﬁeld lines, inherent to the 3D null, show
high gradients of the squashing factor. We ﬁnd slipping reconnections at these
quasi-separatrix layers, which are co-located with the post-ﬂare circular bright-
ening observed at the chromospheric heights. This demonstrates the viability of

initial ﬁeld and its simulated evolution is found to be devoid of any ﬂux rope,
which is in congruence with the conﬁned nature of the ﬂare.

Introduction

The solar corona can be treated as a magnetized plasma having large electrical con-
ductivity with evolution being determined by the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations
(Priest 2014). The magnetic Reynolds number RM (vL/η, in usual notations) for the corona
is of the order of 1010 (Aschwanden 2004), which makes the Alfv´en’s theorem of ﬂux freezing
valid and ensures plasma-parcels to remain tied with magnetic ﬁeld lines (MFLs) during
evolution (Alfv´en 1942). The eruptive events (ﬂares, coronal mass ejections) occurring at
the corona are thought to be signatures of magnetic reconnection (MR): a process involving
the topological rearrangement of MFLs with conversion of magnetic energy into heat and
kinetic energy of mass motion (Shibata & Magara 2011). Notably, the requirement to onset
MRs is small RM which corresponds to small L, the length over which the magnetic ﬁeld
varies. The smallness of L can either be pre-existing in a magnetic topology—manifested as
magnetic nulls and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs)—or can develop autonomously during the
evolution of the magnetoﬂuid. Such autonomous developments (owing to discontinuities in
magnetic ﬁeld) are expected from the Parker’s magnetostatic theorem (Parker 1972, 1988,
1994) which states that for a perfect electrically conducting plasma, the conditions of ﬂux-
freezing and the equilibrium cannot be satisﬁed simultaneously by a magnetic ﬁeld which is
continuous everywhere. The reduction of L and the consequent spontaneous magnetic recon-
nections during a quasi-static evolution of the plasma under a near-precise maintenance of
the ﬂux-freezing has been identiﬁed in contemporary MHD simulations (Kumar et al. 2015a;
Kumar & Bhattacharyya 2016; Kumar et al. 2016). However, these studies were performed
using idealized scenarios of initial bipolar magnetic ﬁelds that lacked the complexities often
observed in solar active regions.

Presently, the coronal ﬁeld needs to be extrapolated from the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld because of a lack of direct measurements. For extrapolation, the usage of the nonlinear-
force-free-ﬁelds(NLFFFs), a subset of force-free-ﬁelds (Wiegelmann 2008; Wiegelmann &
Sakurai 2012) is customary. The NLFFF can be solved analytically (in spherical polar
coordinates) under the assumption of axisymmetry (Low & Lou 1990; Prasad et al. 2014)
but the analytical solution fails to eﬀectively capture the complexity of an active region

– 3 –

magnetogram, which is often non-axisymmetric. Such complexities are well replicated in
NLFFF extrapolations (Duan et al. 2017). Recent MHD simulations based on NLFFF
extrapolations were successful in simulating the coronal dynamics leading to eruptions (Jiang
et al. 2013; Kliem et al. 2013; Amari et al. 2014; Inoue et al. 2014, 2015; Savcheva et al. 2015,
2016; Inoue 2016). Importantly, only the region sandwiched between the photosphere and
the upper corona is relatively force-free whereas at the photosphere—where magnetograms
are obtained—the Lorentz force is non-zero (Gary 2001). Generally, to mitigate this problem
within the framework of NLFFF, a technique called ‘preprocessing’ is often performed on
the photospheric data which minimizes the Lorentz force in the vector magnetograms and
provides a boundary condition suitable for NLFFF extrapolations (Wiegelmann et al. 2006;
Jiang & Feng 2014).

An alternative is the extrapolation using non-force-free-ﬁelds (NFFFs) described by
the double-curl Beltrami equation for the magnetic ﬁeld B (Hu & Dasgupta 2008). The
equation has been analytically solved for an idealized corona (Bhattacharyya et al. 2007;
Kumar & Bhattacharyya 2011) to obtain MFLs resembling coronal loops. Recently, a semi-
analytical construction based on maximizing correlations of non-axisymmetric NFFFs with
photospheric vector magnetograms of NOAA AR11283 successfully mimicked an event of
ﬁlament bifurcation by tracking MHD evolution of a pre-existing ﬂux -rope (Prasad & Bhat-
tacharyya 2016; Prasad et al. 2017) However, missing from the simulation were the small scale
magnetic features and their inﬂuence on the MFL dynamics—which cannot be captured by
analytical/semi-analytical models. To include these magnetic features and determine their
role in overall magnetoﬂuid evolution, here we numerically simulate evolution of AR 12192
initiated with the NFFF extrapolation model developed by Hu & Dasgupta (2008); Hu et al.
(2008); Gary (2009). The focus is to assess the viability of the NFFF extrapolation in gen-
erating MFLs, the evolution of which can reliably imitate the observed dynamics. For the
purpose, we follow the evolution of AR 12192, starting at 20:46 UT on 24th October 2014
and study the X3.1 conﬁned ﬂare occurring at 21:10 UT. Importantly, a non-zero Lorentz
force, instead of prescribed ﬂows (Amari et al. 2003; Aulanier et al. 2010), is envisaged here
to initiate dynamics.

In the rest of the paper, Section 2 discusses the ﬂare-event and the observations required
for the NFFF extrapolation. In Section 3, we present the details of the initial extrapolated
ﬁeld. The MHD model is discussed in Section 4. The results of the simulation are presented
in Section 5 and the Section 6 summarizes important results.

2. Discussions on the X3.1 ﬂare event

The AR12192 was the largest of all active regions appearing in the solar cycle 24 which
produced a series of X-class ﬂares (Chen et al. 2015). The X3.1 ﬂare on October 24, 2014
around 21:15 UT was the strongest in a series which did not lead to any coronal mass
ejection (CME) (Sun et al. 2015; Sarkar & Srivastava 2018). Since there is a very strong
correlation between ﬂare intensity and occurrence of CMEs (Yashiro et al. 2005), this event
has been extensively studied. An absence of ﬂux rope was suggested in Jiang et al. (2016) for
explaining the conﬁned nature whereas the onset of the ﬂare was attributed to tether-cutting
(TC) MRs (Moore et al. 2001) between sheared arcades. Further studies of successive strong
X-class ﬂares triggered by TC reconnections, in the same AR, were also reported in Chen
et al. (2015). Contrarily, using NLFFF extrapolation, Inoue et al. (2016) found a multiple-
ﬂux-tube system located near a Polarity Inversion Line (PIL) to be favorable for the TC
reconnections. They attributed the stability of the ﬂux-tube-system to the overlying strong
tethering MFLs. Similar results were also documented in Chen et al. (2015), where the
mean decay index of the horizontal background ﬁeld was found to be less than the typical
threshold required for the torus instability (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006) to set in. An alternative
explanation was provided by Zhang et al. (2017) who attributed the conﬁned nature to the
complexity of the involved magnetic ﬁeld structures.

The conﬁned X3.1 ﬂare was of long duration, lasting for 6 to 7 hours as shown in
Figure 1(a). The ﬁgure shows the GOES 15 X-ray ﬂux observed during this event in the
1-8 ˚A and 0.5-4 ˚A channels. It should be noted that no appreciable change in the vertical
magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux was recorded during this period at the photospheric boundary. This
is shown in Figure 1(b) which depicts the evolution of negative (dashed line in red) and
positive magnetic ﬂuxes (continuous line in blue), calculated by using the photospheric vector
magnetograms from the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager (HMI)(Schou et al. 2012) on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)(Pesnell et al. 2012). The magnetograms are taken
from the ‘hmi.sharp cea 720s data series’ that provides full-disk vector magnetograms of the
Sun with a temporal cadence of 12 minutes and a spatial resolution of 0(cid:48)(cid:48).5.
In order to
obtain the magnetic ﬁeld on a Cartesian grid, the magnetogram is initially remapped on to a
Lambert cylindrical equal-area (CEA) projection and then transformed into the heliographic
coordinates (Gary & Hagyard 1990). The dotted vertical lines mark the beginning and peak
phase of the ﬂare. Hence, to a good approximation, the vertical magnetic ﬁeld Bz at the
bottom boundary remains constant during the interval. Accordingly, the photosphere can
be approximated to be line tied — a boundary condition used in the simulations discussed
later in the paper.

Importantly, a circular brightening was observed in the chromospheric ﬂare ribbons at

extreme-ultra-violet (EUV) channel 131 ˚A of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
on board SDO(Lemen et al. 2012)). The brightenings occur in the interval 21:20 to 21:35
UT in the 1600 ˚A channel (Figure 2 (a)) and is co-located with the brightening in the 131
˚A channel as seen around 20:58 UT, which is just before the X-class ﬂare. The circular ﬂare
ribbons are known to map MFLs constituting the fan plane of a 3D null on the photosphere
(Masson et al. 2009). To our knowledge, the generation of the circular ribbon was not
reported in the earlier works and is the main focus of the paper.

To simulate evolution of such MFLs, we select the vector magnetogram at 20:46 UT,
roughly 30 minutes prior to the ﬂare. The Figure 3(a) shows the magnetogram of the active
region where the positive and the negative polarities of the longitudinal component of the
magnetic ﬁeld are depicted in white and black, and the gray represents the background.
The transverse components of the positive and negative ﬁelds are shown by blue and red
arrows respectively. The PIL is represented in the ﬁgure by green lines. The AR is visibly
complex, with two main polarities and multiple small-scale features. The MFL topology can
be inferred using the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) channel data as observed in the 171 ˚A ,
shown in Figure 3(b), which plotted on the same CEA spatial grid as in Figure 3(a). The
EUV coronal loops near the PIL are markedly sheared and twisted, indicating a high degree
of complexity in the initial magnetic ﬁeld topology.

3. Non-force-free extrapolation of magnetic ﬁeld

3.1. Description of the numerical extrapolation algorithm

The coronal magnetic ﬁeld of the AR 12192 is obtained by using the numerical non-force
free extrapolation code developed by Hu & Dasgupta (2008); Hu et al. (2008, 2010) where
B is constructed as

B = B1 + B2 + B3; ∇ × Bi = αiBi

(1)

with αi as constant and i = 1, 2, 3; rendering each sub-ﬁeld Bi to be LFFF and α1 (cid:54)= α2 (cid:54)= α3.
Further, without loss of generality, α2 = 0 is selected to make B2 potential. Subsequently,
an optimal pair α = {α1, α3} is obtained by an iterative trial-and-error method which ﬁnds
the pair that minimizes the average deviation between the observed (Bt) and the calculated

3.2.

Initial extrapolated NFFF for AR 12192

We consider the magnetogram on October 24, 20:46 UT obtained from SDO/HMI. The
vector ﬁeld shown in Figure 3(a) corresponds to an original cutout of dimension 1024 × 512
pixels. To reduce the computation cost, the ﬁeld is rescaled and extrapolated over a compu-
tational domain having 256 × 128 × 128 grids in the x, y and z directions. The corresponding
physical extents are 360 Mm in the x direction and 180 Mm in the y and z direction. The
best-ﬁt values obtained for the α parameters in this case are α = {0.1145, −0.0016} which
corresponds to an En = 0.31 (c.f. Equation (2)).

The contour plots for the transverse components of the observed and extrapolated ﬁelds
at the photospheric boundary are shown in Figure 4. The ﬁgure indicates most of the large
scale magnetic features to be well-captured by the extrapolated ﬁeld. The scatter plot of the
observed and the extrapolated ﬁelds is shown in Figure 5. With the perfect correlation—
exact agreement of the extrapolated ﬁeld with the observed one—being marked by the red
line, the plot documents the agreement to be better in the higher ﬁeld side. The Pearson-r
correlation between the two ﬁelds is 0.933, which is acceptable.

The top and side views of MFLs over the full vector magnetogram are shown in Figure
6 with the ﬁeld lines being printed in red. A smaller set of MFLs in the vicinity of the ﬂaring
region (around 21:15 UT) are shown in white. The white MFLs resemble the topology of a 3D
magnetic null (Lau & Finn 1990) and are shown in greater detail in Figure 7. The similarity
of MFL morphology of the extrapolated ﬁeld (panel (b) of Figure 6) with the observed EUV
structure (panel (b) of Figure 3) advocates eﬀectiveness of the extrapolation. The MFL
geometry is characterized by the presence of high and low-lying loops. Notably the low-
lying MFLs, depicted in white, connecting the weak positive polarity with the surrounding
negative polarity regions generate the 3D null. Figure 7(a) corroborates the 3D null to
be complete with a dome shaped fan and an elongated spine. The panel (b) of Figure 7
depicts MFLs on a stack of planes which are approximately tangential to the spine. The
MFLs are overlaid with an isosurface (in red) of |B| having an iso-value which is 2.5% of its

maximum (magniﬁed in the inset). The isosurface locates the 3D null. The height of the
null point is roughly 3 Mm from the photospheric plane. Notably, the MFLs constituting
the dome intersect the bottom boundary to generate footpoints that are distributed in a
circular pattern. The MFLs below the null point form an elongated arcade, as seen in the
inset of Figure 7.

The direct volume renderings of volume current density |J| and Lorentz force |L| are
depicted in Figure 8. Noticeably, the regions of large Lorentz force and high current overlap
with those of high values of |Bz|, which can be realized by a direct comparison with Figure 6
(b). The values for |J| and |L| are mentioned in arbitrary units as we are mostly interested
in their variation with height. The ﬁgure reveals a sharp decay of the Lorentz force with
height (by a factor of 1/5000) while the current shows a decay by only a factor of 1/100.
The current thus becomes more and more ﬁeld-aligned with increasing height, ultimately
making the magnetic ﬁeld force-free in the asymptotic limit.

4. Numerical model

The evolution is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes MHD equations under
the assumption of thermal homogeneity and perfect electrical conductivity (Bhattacharyya

The kinematic viscosity is denoted by ν. The ratio τa/τν represents an eﬀective viscosity of
the system which, along with the other forces, inﬂuences the dynamics.

√

To solve the MHD Equations (3a)-(3d), we utilize the well established magnetohydro-
dynamic numerical model EULAG-MHD (Smolarkiewicz & Charbonneau 2013), which is
an extension of the hydrodynamic model EULAG predominantly used in atmospheric and
climate research (Prusa et al. 2008). The pressure perturbation, denoted by p, about a ther-
modynamically uniform ambient state satisﬁes an elliptic boundary value problem, which
is generated by imposing the discretized incompressibility constraint (Equation 3b) on the
discrete integral form of the momentum equation (Equation 3a); cf.(Bhattacharyya et al.
2010) and the references therein. An identical procedure involving the gradient of an aux-
iliary potential in the induction equation (Equation 3c) is employed to keep B solenoidal,
see Ghizaru et al. (2010) and Smolarkiewicz & Charbonneau (2013) for details. For the
completeness, here we mention only important features of the EULAG-MHD and refer the
readers to Smolarkiewicz & Charbonneau (2013) and references therein for detailed discus-
sions. The model is based on the spatio-temporally second-order accurate non-oscillatory
forward-in-time multidimensional positive deﬁnite advection transport algorithm, MPDATA
(Smolarkiewicz 2006). Important is the proven dissipative property of the MPDATA which,
intermittently and adaptively, regularizes the under-resolved scales by simulating MRs and
mimicking the action of explicit subgrid-scale turbulence models (Margolin et al. 2006) in

– 16 –

the spirit of Implicit Large Eddy Simulations (ILES) (Grinstein et al. 2007). Such ILESs
performed with the model have already been successfully utilized to simulate magnetic recon-
nections (MRs) to understand their role in the development of various magnetic structures in
the solar corona (Kumar et al. 2015a, 2016; Prasad et al. 2017). The simulations presented
continue to rely on the eﬀectiveness of ILES in regularizing the onset of MRs.

5. Simulation results and discussions

The simulations are initialized from a motionless state with the initial magnetic ﬁeld
given by the NFFF extrapolation and the magnetoﬂuid idealized to be thermally homoge-
neous and having perfect electrical conductivity. The ﬂow is generated as the initial Lorentz
force pushes the plasma. To ensure the net magnetic ﬂux to be zero in the computational
domain, all components of volume B except for Bz, are continued to the boundaries for a
given time step (Kumar et al. 2015a). At the bottom boundary, Bz is kept constant (line-tied
boundary) since the change of magnetic ﬂux at the boundary is minimal (see Figure 1(b)).
For the simulation, we set the dimensionless constant τa/τν ≈ 7 × 10−3, which is roughly
two orders of magnitude larger than its coronal value. The higher value of τa/τν speeds
up the relaxation because of a more eﬃcient viscous dissipation without aﬀecting magnetic
topologies. The density is set to ρ0 = 1 and kinematic viscosity to ν = 0.002, in scaled units.
The spatial unit step ∆x = 0.0078, while the time step is taken as ∆t = 5 × 10−3 to satisfy
the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability condition (Courant et al. 1967). The results
presented here pertain to a run for 1000 ∆t which roughly corresponds to an observation
time of one and half hour. Due to the constant mass density, the ﬂow generated in the
computation is incompressible—an assumption also used in earlier works (Dahlburg et al.
1991; Aulanier et al. 2005). Although the compressibility of the ﬂuid is important for the
thermodynamics of coronal loops (Ruderman & Roberts 2002), our focus for the present
is on their magnetic topology only. Notably, the RM throughout the simulation is inﬁnity
expect during MRs facilitated by the MPDATA driven dissipation.

Figures 9 and 10 depict MFL evolution in the neighborhood of the 3D null at two
diﬀerent viewing angles. The Bz contours are plotted on the bottom boundary. Four sets
of MFLs are highlighted. The fan and the spine of the null are made by the yellow MFLs
whereas the red MFLs are overlying the null. The blue MFLs are located inside the dome
whereas the arcade below the null is formed by the green MFLs. With evolution, the null
and the constituent yellow MFLs do not sustain an appreciable ascent whereas the red MFLs
expand signiﬁcantly to a threshold height (≈ 78Mm), after which they contract. To explore
the underlying physics, we note the arcade MFLs (in green) and the dome (yellow) constitute

an X-type geometry cf. panel (b) of Figure 7. As reconnection occurs at the X-type null,
blue MFLs come out of the dome and overlays it. The consequent increase in local magnetic
pressure pushes the red MFLs upward, resulting in their overall rise. Furthermore, the red
MFLs get stretched as they rise and at a threshold generate enough magnetic tension to stop
additional upward motion. The threshold corresponds to a critical value of ≈ 1.5 for the

decay index, where the decay index is deﬁned as n = −

∂(log |B|)
∂(log z)

(Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006).

Figure 10 conﬁrms, in their maximal rise, the MFLs can only attain n (cid:39) 1.3 − 1.4 which is
in conformity with the conﬁned nature of the X3.1 ﬂare. Moreover, like (Jiang et al. 2016),
we also fail to identify a ﬂux rope, which further agrees with the conﬁned nature of the ﬂare.

The simulated 3D null appears to rotate with evolution (Figure 11). For aiding visu-
alization, the MFLs have been color-coded based on their distance along the y axis. We
have also shown the volume wherein the seed points of MFLs are located. When viewed
from the top, an anti-clockwise rotation of the MFLs is quite prominent which matched very
well with the similar dynamics seen in the AIA 131 ˚A channel. This correspondence with
observations gives more credibility to the simulation. The Figure 12 is also overlaid with
streamlines (green) and |J|/|B|. Noticeable is the initial high value of |J|/|B| near the null.
The value increases with time, becoming maximum at t = 400, decaying subsequently. The
peaking of |J|/|B| is indicative of magnetic reconnections occurring near the null. The resul-
tant outﬂow is shown by the red streamlines. For further investigation, Figure 13 plots the
Q-map where the squashing factor Q is calculated by following Demoulin et al. (1996); Liu
et al. (2016) and ascertains the dome to have high gradient of magnetic connectivity which
results in slipping reconnections (Aulanier et al. 2007). The subsequent change in magnetic
connectivity manifests as the seeming MFL rotation. For validation, we note the co-located
ﬂow (in green) is not along the rotation and hence, cannot cause it.

In panels (a) and (b) of Figure 14, we overlay intensity structures in wavelengths 1600
˚A at 21:25 UT and 131 ˚A at 20:50 UT with corresponding MFLs. Importantly, the almost
exact match of the footpoints for both wavelengths with brightenings not only establishes
the importance of the 3D null in the circular ﬂare ribbon but also being in agreement with
the contemporary understanding, validates the eﬀectiveness of the NFFF extrapolation in
constructing a valid coronal ﬁeld model.

and incompressible. The simulations are initialized with magnetic ﬁeld lines extrapolated
from SDO/HMI vector magnetograms using a new technique which employs a model where
the corona is not strictly force-free and has some Lorentz force. Nevertheless, the Lorentz
force decreases rapidly with height making the corona to be force-free in an asymptotic
limit—agreeing with the standard scenario of the coronal ﬁeld. Advantageously, this non-
force-free-ﬁeld extrapolation model self-consistently initialize the coronal dynamics without
requiring prescribed plasma ﬂows which are somewhat custom-made.

The extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld is found to have a 3D null located approximately at
a height of 3 Mm from the photosphere and has clearly distinguishable spine and a dome
shaped fan. Importantly, a magnetic arcade is found to be located within the dome and
making an X-type null with it. A Q-map of the initial ﬁeld identiﬁes the dome with a region
where the gradient of the ﬁeld line connectivity is large.

The simulation focuses on a circular brightening recorded in 1600 ˚A channel at around
21:21 UT. The absence of any ﬂux emergence in the window of 19:00 UT-24:00 UT allows
the vertical ﬁeld at the bottom boundary to be assumed as line-tied. To optimize the
computation cost, the simulation is performed on 256 × 128 × 128 grids along the x, y and,
z respectively, resolving a physical domain of 360 × 180 × 180 Mm3. It is initiated not by
a prescribed ﬂow, but by the initial Lorentz force which onset the evolution autonomously.
Subsequently, the favorable forces bring non-parallel ﬁeld lines in close proximity of the
3D null, which ultimately leads to unresolved scales. In the spirit of ILES, the MPDATA
then generates locally adaptive residual dissipation to regularize the underresolved scales
with simulated MRs. Further, the MRs are found to be consistent with the idea of slipping
reconnection, standard at a 3D null, and imparts a sense of rotation to the footpoints of the
dome. Such a rotation is also observed in the channel ˚A, corroborating the observed circular
brightening to be caused by MRs at the 3D null.

Magnetic reconnections also occur at the X-type null formed by the MFLs belonging
to the arcade and the spine.
Interestingly, reconnections enable MFLs contained within
the dome to come out of it and overlay the spine. The consequent increase in magnetic
pressure raises the overlying MFLs further up and in principle, can cause the X3.1 ﬂare
observed at 21:15 UT. The ﬂare was conﬁned in nature and resulted in no CMEs. In the
simulation, the MFLs are found to never reach a height where the decay index becomes more
the critical value required for the torus instability to set in, conﬁrming further the eﬃcacy
of the simulation in replicating the observation.
