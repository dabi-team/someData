Highlights from the NA61/SHINE strong-interactions
programme

Abstract. NA61/SHINE is a multipurpose ﬁxed-target facility at the CERN
SPS. The main goals of the NA61/SHINE strong-interactions programme are to
discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter as well as to study the
properties of the onset of deconﬁnement. In order to reach these goals, a study
of hadron production properties is performed in nucleus-nucleus, proton-proton
and proton-nucleus interactions as a function of collision energy and size of the
colliding nuclei. In this contribution, the NA61/SHINE results from a strong
interaction measurement programme are presented. In particular, the latest re-
sults from diﬀerent reactions p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, and Pb+Pb on hadron spec-
tra, as well as intermittency, higher-order moments of multiplicity ﬂuctuations
and spectator induced electromagnetic eﬀects are discussed.

1 NA61/SHINE experiment

NA61/SHINE detection system is a large acceptance hadron spectrometer based on a set of
eight Time Projection Chambers complemented by Time-of-Flight detectors. This setup al-
lows for precise momentum reconstruction and identiﬁcation of charged particles. The high-
resolution forward calorimeter, the Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD), measures energy
ﬂow around the beam direction, so-called Forward Energy (EF), which in nucleus-nucleus
can be related to the collision centrality [1].

NA61/SHINE performed a two-dimensional scan in collision energy (13A-150A GeV/c
and system size (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb) to study the phase diagram of
strongly interacting matter. Currently, NA61/SHINE pursues the physics programme focused
on the open charm production measurements in order to determine the mechanism of open
charm production, the impact of the onset of deconﬁnement on open charm production and
investigate the impact of the QGP formation on J/Ψ production.

2 Study of the onset of deconﬁnement and onset of ﬁreball

2.1 Particle production properties

The main motivation of the NA61/SHINE physics programme are the predictions of the Sta-
tistical Model of the Early Stage (SMES) [2]. The theory predicts a 1st order phase transition
from the QGP to a hadron matter phase between top AGS and top SPS energies.
In the
transition region, constant temperature and pressure in the mixed-phase and an increase of

the number of internal degrees of freedom is expected. SMES proposes several observables,
which indicates the phase transition.

Fig. 1 presents the system-size dependence of K+/π+ ratio at mid-rapidity obtained by
NA61/SHINE: p+p [5], Be+Be [6] and Ar+Sc (preliminary); and NA49: Pb+Pb [7]; at
150A/158A GeV/c beam momenta. The K+/π+ ratio was predicted within SMES as one

of the signatures of the onset of deconﬁnement. The results were compared with few dynam-
ical models. Those without phase transition (EPOS [12], UrQMD [14] and SMASH [13])
agree with the results from small systems (p+p and Be+Be), while fail to describe the re-
sults from heavier systems (Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb). In contrast to the one with phase transition
(PHSD [15, 16]), which follows the trend determined by the heaviest system (Pb+Pb) and
overestimates the ratio for smaller systems. Similarly, testes statistical models: with (renor-
malised SMES [4]) and without (HRG [14]) the phase transition tends to overestimate the
K+/π+ ratio especially in the small-mass region of colliding nuclei.

energy measure, F =
sNN. NA61/SHINE results: p+p [8], Be+Be [9]
and Ar+Sc [10] were compared with NA49 results from Pb+Pb [3] and others. (cid:104)π(cid:105)/(cid:104)W(cid:105) for
Ar+Sc reactions equals that for N+N1 reactions at low SPS energies whereas it is consistent
with that for central Pb+Pb reactions at high SPS energies. The behaviour of Ar+Sc stands
in contradiction to Be+Be measurements, which are close to the Pb+Pb results except for
the top SPS beam energy. The steepening of the slope of the (cid:104)π(cid:105)/(cid:104)W(cid:105), which is considered
a signal of the onset of deconﬁnement within the SMES [2] is observed neither in central
Ar+Sc nor in central Be+Be measurements.

The energy dependence of the sound velocities extracted from the data [8–10] are pre-
sented in ﬁg. 2 (right). Results from central Pb+Pb and Au+Au collisions exhibit a clear
√
sNN ≈ 10 GeV consistent with the reported
minimum (usually called the softest point) at
onset of deconﬁnement [3, 7]. The energy range for results from Ar+Sc, Be+Be central col-
lisions and inelastic p + p interactions is too limited to allow a signiﬁcant conclusion about a
possible minimum.

2.2 Flow

NA61/SHINE experiment reports results on anisotropic ﬂow, measured in centrality selected
Pb+Pb collisions at 13A and 30A GeV/c beam momentum. The experimental setup allows
tracking and particle identiﬁcation over a wide rapidity range. Flow coeﬃcients were mea-
sured relative to the spectator plane estimated with PSD, which is unique for NA61/SHINE.
Preliminary results on the directed ﬂow of negatively charged pion are presented in the left
panel of ﬁg. 3. In mid-central collisions the ﬂow of negatively charged pions has minimum at

fers from the ones measured at 30A/40A GeV/c. Dependence of v1(pT ) for protons produces

In contrast, the slope of proton v1 changes sign for centrality of about

are presented in the right panel of ﬁg. 3. The pT dependence of v2 coeﬃcient of negatively
charged pions diﬀers from the one measured for protons, but it does not show any energy
dependence.

3 Search for critical point

One of the main goals of the NA61/SHINE experiment is to locate the critical point (CP) of
strongly interacting matter. The expected signal of a CP is a non-monotonic dependence of
various ﬂuctuations (e.g. multiplicity, transverse momentum, baryon density ﬂuctuations).

To study the ﬂuctuations in systems of diﬀerent sizes one should use quantities insensi-
tive to system volume (so-called intensive quantities), for example constructed by division
of cumulants κi of the measured distribution (up to fourth order), where i is the order of
the cumulant. For second, third and fourth order cumulants intensive quantities are deﬁned
as: κ2/κ1, κ3/κ2 and κ4/κ2. Fig. 4 shows energy dependence of second (left), third (middle)
and fourth (right) order cumulant ratio of negatively charged hadrons measured in p+p in-
teractions as well as Be+Be and Ar+Sc central collisions. The second-order cumulant ratio

reveals an increasing diﬀerence between κ2/κ1 values from small systems (p+p and Be+Be)
and a heavier system (Ar+Sc) with collision energy. The p+p results on third-order cumulant
ratio tend to be higher than the ones from Be+Be at higher collision energies. Whereas, the
fourth-order cumulant ratio indicates consistent values for all measured systems at given col-
lision energy. More detailed studies are still needed, however, no structure indicating CP was
observed so far.

Possible tool for search of CP is a proton intermittency. The proximity of CP is expected
to manifest itself in local power-law ﬂuctuations of the baryon density which can be searched
for by studying the scaling behaviour of second factorial moments, F2(δ) = (cid:104) 1

with the cell size or, equivalently, with the number of cells in (px , py) space of protons at
mid-rapidity [18–20]. NA61/SHINE measures F2(M) using using statistically independent
points and cumulative variables. Preliminary results on F2(M) of mid-rapidity protons mea-
sured in 0-20% most central Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c and 0-10% most central Pb+Pb
collisions are presented in ﬁg. 5 in left and right panels, respectively. The intermittency index
φ2 for a system freezing out at the QCD critical endpoint is expected to be φ2 = 5/6 assuming

that the latter belongs to the 3-D Ising universality class. F2(M) of protons for Ar+Sc at 150A
GeV/c and Pb+Pb at 30A GeV/c show no indication for power-law increase with a bin size.

4 Strangeness production in p+p interactions

+

NA61/SHINE provides unique high precision results on strange hyperons production in p+p
, Ξ0(1530) and Ξ0
interactions at 158 GeV/c: Ξ−, Ξ
(1530). The rapidity spectra were re-
ported and compared to transport model predictions. Among tested models, EPOS describes
the spectra of mentioned hyperons reasonably well. UrQMD agrees with Ξ− spectra measured
by NA61/SHINE. Additionally, the mean multiplicities of Ξ− and Ξ
produced in inelastic
p+p interactions at 158 GeV/c was used to quantify the strangeness enhancement in A+A
collisions at the same centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair. More details can be found
in [21, 22].

5 Spectator-induced electromagnetic effects

Charged spectators of the nuclear collision generate electromagnetic ﬁelds, which modify
the trajectories of π+ and π−, which can result in charge splitting of directed ﬂow.
It is
expected that the ﬁnal state spectra π+ and π− are modiﬁed by those ﬁelds. For convenience
the double diﬀerential π+/π− spectra ratios are studied [23, 24]. NA61/SHINE reports new
data on spectator-induced electromagnetic eﬀects in Ar+Sc collisions at 40A GeV/c beam
momentum. The results are presented in ﬁg. 6 for PSD selected event centrality classes:
central (left), semi-central (middle) and semi-peripheral (right). The magnitude of the π+/π−
spectra ratio modiﬁcation increases with the peripherality of the collision. The eﬀect is the
strongest for pions moving at spectator velocity (xF ≈ 0.15), close to spectator trajectory
(pT ≈ 25 MeV/c).

6 Summary

Presented experimental results on particle production properties reveal unexpected system-
size dependence of K+/π+ ratio in mid-rapidity, which is not reproduced by any tested the-
oretical models. The velocity of sound extracted from the width of rapidity distribution of π

mesons produced in N+N interactions and central Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions is consistent
with results for central Pb+Pb and Au+Au collisions. Measurements in a broader energy
range are needed to conclude on a possible minimum of the sound velocity in small nuclei
collisions. The results on the mean pion multiplicity to the number of wounded nucleons ratio
and its collision energy dependence suggests an increase of the eﬀective number of degrees
of freedom already in central Ar+Sc collisions at the top SPS energies. Moreover, presented
results show no indications of the CP in Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c. The measured
directed ﬂow of pions shows energy dependence, with the slope of negatively charged pi-
ons changing sign at diﬀerent collision centralities in Pb+Pb collisions. Unique results on
multi-strange baryons production in p+p interactions at 158 GeV/c beam momentum were
discussed. Finally, the ﬁrst observation of the electromagnetic eﬀects in Ar+Sc at 40A GeV/c
beam momentum was presented.
