Abstract

It is well known that residual electrostatic forces create signiﬁcant diﬃculties to precise measure-

ments of the Casimir force and to wide use of Casimir-operated microdevices. We experimentally

demonstrate that with the help of Ar-ion cleaning of the surfaces it is possible to make electrostatic

eﬀects negligibly small as compared to the Casimir interaction. Our experimental setup consists of

the dynamic atomic force microscope supplemented with an Ar-ion gun and argon reservoir. The

residual potential diﬀerence between the Au-coated surfaces of a sphere and a plate was measured

both before and after the in situ Ar-ion cleaning. It is shown that this cleaning decreases the mag-

nitude of the residual potential by up to an order of magnitude and makes it almost independent

on separation. The gradient of the Casimir force was measured using ordinary samples subjected

to the Ar-ion cleaning. The obtained results are shown to be in good agreement with both previous

precision measurements using the specially selected samples and with theoretical predictions of the

Lifshitz theory. The conclusion is made that the suggested method of in situ Ar-ion cleaning is

eﬀective in reducing the electrostatic eﬀects and therefore is a great resource for experiments on

measuring the Casimir interaction and for Casimir-operated microdevices.

INTRODUCTION

During the last few years a great progress has been made in precision measurements of

the Casimir interaction caused by the zero-point and thermal ﬂuctuations of the electromag-

netic ﬁeld (see the most precision experiments with conductor test bodies [1–10] and reviews

[11, 12]). This has raised a question on the possibility of using the Casimir force in various

micro- and nanoelectromechanical devices which ﬁnd expanding applications in fundamental

science, engineering and industry. As was understood decades ago [13, 14], with shrinking

dimensions of microdevices to hundreds and tens nanometers the ﬂuctuation-induced van

der Waals [15] and Casimir [16] forces should make a pronounced eﬀect on their function-

ality. However, ﬁfteen years have passed after publication of Refs. [13, 14] before the ﬁrst

microdevices driven by the Casimir force were demonstrated [17, 18]. This gave impetus to

research devoted to the role of stiction [19, 20], electrostatic eﬀects [21], surface roughness

[22–24], geometry and dielectric properties of materials [25, 26], and phase transformations

[27] in nanotechnological systems exploiting the Casimir force for their functionality. Var-

ious possibilities to create the Casimir switch have also been discussed [28, 29]. Finally,

Casimir forces acting on a micromechanical chip and between silicon nanostructures were

experimentally demonstrated [30, 31]. Hence, the engineering and industrial applications of

the Casimir microdevices are within sight.

There is, however, a fundamental problem that plagued both the investigation of the

Casimir forces and their application in nanodevices. It is connected with the existence of

the residual electrostatic forces acting between two grounded metallic bodies in vacuum.

They originate from the surface patches due to the polycrystal structure of a metal, im-

purities, dust, surface contaminants and resulting work-function inhomogeneities, and may

signiﬁcantly distort the magnitude of the Casimir force. In fact the electric forces caused

by the distribution of patch potentials depend critically on the surface preparation and may

at times be negligibly small and at other times relatively large, as compared to the mea-

sured force (see Refs. [32, 33] and literature therein). They should be taken into account

in any measurement of small forces between the closely spaced metallic surfaces, e.g., the

gravitational force [34].

In measurements of the Casimir interaction the electrostatic force due to surface patches

manifests itself as a dependence of the residual potential diﬀerence on the separation between

2

the surfaces. In the most precise experiments on measuring the gradient of the Casimir force

between a sphere and a plate (or the eﬀective Casimir pressure between two parallel plates)

made of Au [1–3, 6] or Au and Ni [7–9] the residual potential diﬀerence was demonstrated

to be independent of separation. This was achieved through the rejection of all samples

possessing the separation-dependent residual potentials. Note that in the diﬀerence mea-

surement of the Casimir force [10] (experiments of this kind have been proposed in Refs.

[35–37]) the role of surface patches was largely eliminated. In fact a rejection of many of

the prepared samples is a plausible strategy when speaking about some unique fundamental

experiment. Such an approach is, however, not acceptable in the day-to-day fabrication and

operation of microdevices driven by the Casimir force. Thus, the problem of surface patches

in Casimir physics calls for further investigation.

In this paper, we demonstrate the method allowing nearly full elimination of the elec-

trostatic eﬀects in the Casimir-operated microdevices. We use the experimental setup on

measuring the gradient of the Casimir force between two Au-coated surfaces of a sphere and

a plate by means of dynamic atomic force microscope described in Refs.

[6–9]. The main

modiﬁcation we made in this setup is that the vacuum chamber was equipped for doing the

cleaning of sphere and plate surfaces by means of argon ion beam. It has been known that

an interaction with a controlled ionized Ar beam can be used for an improvement of the

surface quality including the removal of impurities and contaminants [38]. The ion beam

cleaning is commonly used in the manufactoring of electronic devices. According to our

results, the multistep Ar-ion cleaning of the ordinary (contaminated) plate and sphere sur-

faces leads to up to an order of magnitude decrease of the residual potential and signiﬁcantly

weakens its dependence on separation. As a consequence, the electrostatic force becomes

negligibly small comparing to the Casimir force and not detrimental for the functionality

of a microdevice. We also perform measurements of the gradient of the Casimir force and

the eﬀective Casimir pressure between two parallel plates using the cleaned samples and

demonstrate good agreement with both experimental and theoretical results of Refs. [1–

3, 6–9] obtained with specially selected samples. Thus, the suggested method opens up

novel avenues in measuring the Casimir interaction and for application of the Casimir force

in nanotechnology.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II we present the brief description of the

experimental setup. Section III contains the experimental results and their comparison with

3

theory. In Sec. IV the reader will ﬁnd our conclusions and discussion.

II. THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The general scheme of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. It includes (1) the

Ar-ion gun (RBD Model 04-165), (2) the reservoir of Ar gas, and (3) the cantilever of an

atomic force microscope with attached Au-coated sphere of R = 60.8µm radius. The chip

4 holding the cantilever is mounted on two piezoelectric actuators 5 and 6 using a clip.

In the dynamic regime employed in this experiment they are used to drive oscillations of

the cantilever at its resonant frequency with a constant amplitude. The Au-coated plate is

mounted on top of a tube piezoelectric actuator 7 capable of travelling a distance of 2.3 µm.

The ﬁrst ﬁber optic interferometer 8 monitores the displacements of the Au plate mounted

on the piezoelectric actuator 7. The second ﬁber interferometer 9 records the cantilever

oscillations. The experiments were done in a high-vacuum chamber with pressure down to
10−9 Torr. For the frequency demodulation the phase locked loop has been used. All details

of the experimental setup and its calibration are described in Ref. [6]. Because of this, below

we concentrate only on the novel elements represented by the Ar-ion cleaning system.

As mentioned in Sec. I, the Ar-ion cleaning has long been used for improvement of the

quality of surfaces particularly in surface science.

It was applied by many authors for

diﬀerent purposes as a method which does not change an alignment and does not modify

the structures in the experiments [38, 40, 45–51]. In our setup (see Fig. 1) the Ar ion gun

is mounted horizontally to the left of the sphere and plate with a 2.75 inch CF ﬂange. The

distance of the sphere to the output of the Ar-ion gun nose cone is about 15 cm. There is a

clear line of sight from the Ar-ion gun to both a sphere and a plate. The horizontal mounting

of the Ar-ion gun leads to the grazing incidence of Ar ions on the plate surface. This reduces

the sputtering of Au [46]. To reduce its outgassing rate, the ion gun was wrapped with a
heat tape and baked to over 100 ◦C for 24 hours. The source of the Ar ions is from an Ar gas

reservoir ﬁlled to 2 atm of Ar which is mounted below the gun using a 1.3 inch CF ﬂange.

To operate the Ar-ion gun, the main vacuum chamber was backﬁlled with Ar gas to a
static pressure of 2.5 × 10−5 Torr using the Ar gas reservoir. The Ar atoms were ionized

by electron impact within the ion source’s dual ﬁlament ionization chamber. In the Ar-ion

gun assembly, the dual tungsten ﬁlaments were arranged oﬀ-axis to minimize the impurity

4

content of the Ar-ion beam. The ionized Ar ions were then extracted from the ionization

chamber, accelerated through the focus lens, and directed to the sphere and the plate. To

reduce the negative impact of Ar ions, both the kinetic energy, as well as the ion ﬂux, were

controlled. High ion kinetic energies lead to Au atoms sputtering oﬀ the sphere and plate

surfaces as well as to burial of Ar ions due to their deep penetration [40]. The burial of

Ar ions in the Au can be monitored as a change of the residual potential when the ion gun

is turned oﬀ. Various ion kinetic energies from 2000 to 500 eV were tried. The higher ion

kinetic energy leads to rapidly time varying residual potential immediately after the Ar-ion

cleaning due to the aforementioned buried Ar ions in the Au. As a result, the Ar-ion kinetic

energy of 500 eV and ﬂux of 10 µA have been used. The diﬀerent Ar-ion cleaning times have

been probed under these conditions.

The extent of contamination of Au surfaces as a function of the Ar-ion cleaning time was

monitored through the change in the residual potential diﬀerence. This is essentially equiv-

alent to the commonly used surface science probes such as the Auger electron spectroscopy

and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

III. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND COMPARISON WITH THEORY

The ﬁrst measurements have been made with an ordinary (uncleaned) sphere and plate

exposed during some time to an ambient environment. These data were taken using the

procedure described in detail in Ref. [6]. Speciﬁcally, the absolute separations were deter-

mined as a = a0 + zpiezo, where zpiezo is the distance traveled by the plate due to the voltage

applied to the piezoelectric actuator situated under the plate, and a0 is the closest separation

between the Au sphere and Au plate. Then 11 diﬀerent voltages Vi have been applied to

the plate and the corresponding frequency shift ∆ωi have been measured. Any drift of the

frequency shift signal due to the mechanical drift of the piezo actuator was subtracted using

the procedure described in Ref. [6].

The obtained frequency shift ∆ω has a parabolic dependence on the applied voltage [6]

∆ω = −β(V − V0)2 − C

where FC is the Casimir force, C = ω0/(2k) is expressed via the natural frequency of the

.

Here, ǫ0 is the permittivity of a free space, cosh α ≡ 1 + a/R, and R is the sphere radius.

(cid:9)

Equation (2) is obtained by diﬀerentiation with respect to separation of the exact expression

for the electrostatic force in the sphere-plate geometry [6, 16, 41].

The residual potential diﬀerence V0, corresponding to the position of the parabola maxi-
mum, was found from Eq. (1) using χ2 ﬁtting procedure over the entire measurement range

from a0 to 700 nm.

In a similar way the data for the curvature of the parabola β were

obtained. The quantities a0 and C were found by ﬁtting the data for β as function of the

separation distance to the theoretical expression (2).

In Fig. 2 the resulting values of the residual potential diﬀerence are shown as dots at

each absolute separation from 235 to 700 nm with a step of 1 nm. As is seen in Fig. 2, for

an uncleaned sample V0 takes rather high values exceeding 32 mV. In Fig. 2 we also show

the best ﬁt of the obtained values of V0 to the straight line leaving its slope and an initial

point as free parametrs. This line is described by the equation

V0 = (2.60 × 10−3a + 31.95) mV,

(3)

where a is measured in nm. From Fig. 2 one can conclude that V0 substantially depends on

separation. The change of V0 between ﬁnal and initial points of the straight line is equal to

approximately 1.3 mV.

Next we performed several measurements of V0 at the closest separation in order to

demonstrate the eﬀect of Ar-ion cleaning qualitatively. To simplify the procedure, in these

measurements the small corrections due to mechanical drift of the piezo actuator have been

disregarded. The initial measurement performed before starting the cleaning resulted in

V0 = 31.8 mV. Then we did the Ar-ion cleaning of the sphere and plate surfaces during 5 min

and again determined the value of the residual potential diﬀerence at the closest separation

V0 = 20.5 mV. After that we have performed three more Ar-ion cleaning procedures, with

the durations 10, 20, and 63 min, and after each of them determined the value of V0. Thus,

6

after the total pariod of 98 min of Ar-ion cleaning the value of V0 = 2.4 mV was obtained.

In Fig. 3 the residual potential diﬀrence is plotted as a function of the cleaning time. As

is seen in this ﬁgure, for smaller V0 its value decreases more slowly with the cleaning time.

After 98 min of the Ar-ion cleaning we observe a decrease of V0 by the factor of 13.

For a full quantitative investigation of the eﬀect of Ar-ion cleaning on V0 we have done

additional Ar-ion cleaning of the surface for 100 min. Thereafter the accurate measurements

of V0 for cleaned surfaces as a function of separation have been performed with a step of

1 nm taking into account the drift of the piezo actuator. The obtained results are shown as

dots in Fig. 4(a). As is seen in this ﬁgure, an additional Ar-ion cleaning resulted in further

decrease of V0 (up to a factor of 30 at the shortest separation as compared with the case of

an uncleaned sample in Fig. 2). The best ﬁt of the data for V0 to the straight line, which is

also shown in Fig. 4(a), results in

V0 = (1.07 × 10−3a + 0.928) mV.

(4)

From the comparison of this equation with Eq. (3) one ﬁnds that the slope of the straight line

decreased by a factor of 2.43. The respective drop of V0 between ﬁnal and initial separation

distances is equal to 0.50 mV, i.e., became smaller by a factor of 2.60.

After ﬁnishing of this measurement, we have performed one more Ar-ion cleaning of the

surface with a duration of 60 min. Then the residual potential diﬀerence was measured again

as a function of separation. The measurement results are shown as dots in Fig. 4(b) as well

as the best ﬁt to the straight line

V0 = (0.917 × 10−3a − 5.80) mV.

(5)

As a result of one more Ar-ion cleaning, the slope of this line has decreased further [by a

factor of 2.84 in comparison with an uncleaned sample in Eq. (3) and by a factor of 1.17

compared to Eq. (4)]. Note also that the dispersion of dots in Fig. 4(b) is much smaller than

in Fig. 4(a).

Finally, we have determined the experimental values of the gradient of the Casimir force

for the measurement set of Fig. 4(b) obtained after the longest Ar-ion cleaning. This was

done using Eq. (1) where the applied voltage V was put equal to the mean residual voltage

hV0i = −5.37 mV as is in Eq. (5) and Fig. 4(b). At each separation the voltage V = hV0i

was applied 11 times and the mean value of the gradient of the Casimir force was obtained.

7

Then it was recalculated into the eﬀective Casimir pressure between two parallel Au plates

using the proximity force approximation [16]

PC(a) = −

2πR

∂FC(a)

,

(6)

which is suﬃciently precise for our purposes. As was shown recently [42–44], the relative

correction to the proximity force approximation is approximately equal to 0.5a/R, i.e., varies

from 0.19% to 0.33% when the separation increases from 235 to 400 nm.

In Fig. 5 the

obtained values of the Casimir pressure are indicated as crosses over the separation regions

(a) from 235 to 350 nm with a step of 1 nm and (b) from 350 to 700 nm with a step of 3 nm for

better visualization. The arms of the crosses show the total experimental errors determined

at a 67% conﬁdence level. The absolute error in the measurements of separation is equal to

0.5 nm. The relative error in the Casimir pressures at a = 235 nm is equal to approximately

2% and increases with increasing separation. Thus, it is an order of magnitude larger than

that introduced from using the proximity force approximation. Note that in Ref. [6], where

all measurements have been performed using selected samples which have V0 independent of

separation, the error in the Casimir pressure at the shortest separation was equal to 0.75%.

We have also compared the measured values of the eﬀective Casimir pressures with the-

oretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory computed using the tabulated optical data for

the complex index of refraction of Au [39]. It has long been known that there is the out-

standing problem in the comparison of the Lifshitz theory with experiment connected with

an extrapolation of the available optical data to zero frequency by either the Drude or the

plasma model (see, e.g., Refs. [11, 12, 16]). The point is that all precise experiments on

measuring the Casimir interaction between metallic test bodies exclude the predictions of

the Lifshitz theory if this extrapolation is made by the Drude model taking into account

the relaxation properties of conduction electrons [1–3, 6–10]. The same experiments are in a

very good agreement with the theoretical predictions when the extrapolation is made by the

lossless plasma model. This result has been conclusively conﬁrmed by the diﬀerential force

measurement of Ref. [10], where the diﬀerence in theoretical predictions using two diﬀerent

extrapolations was up to a factor of 103.

We have computed the Casimir pressure between two parallel plates made of Au at

the laboratory temperature T = 300 K using the Drude and plasma extrapolations of the

optical data to zero frequency in the same way as in Ref. [6]. The obtained results are

8

shown in Fig. 5 by the upper and lower solid lines, respectively. As is seen in this ﬁgure,

the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the plasma model for an extrapolation of the

optical data (the lower line) are in a very good agreement with the measurement data over

the entire measurement range. The theoretical predictions using an extrapolation by means

of the Drude model (the upper line) are excluded by the data over the separation region

from 235 to 400 nm. Thus, the use of ordinary (not especially selected) a sphere and a plate,

which were subjected to the Ar-ion cleaning, leads to qualitatively the same conclusions

concerning a comparison between experiment and theory as the most precise experiments

performed previously. The drawback of using the Ar-ion cleaned ordinary samples lies in the

somewhat larger measurement errors, but this point is of more importance for fundamental

research rather than for the manufacture and functionality of microdevices.

Taking into account that in Fig. 5(b) some dependence of V0 on separation still persists,

it is interesting to compare the remaining noncompensated electric force with the Casimir

force. Calculations using Eq. (4) show that at separations a = 235, 300, 400, and 700 nm the

electric pressure constitutes only 0.9, 1.3, 2.1, and 5.2% of the Casimir pressure, respectively.

Thus, one can neglect the role of residual electric forces when considering the functionality

of microdevices using the Ar-ion cleaned samples. Quite to the contrary, before the Ar-ion

cleaning it was hV0i = 33.16 mV (see Fig. 2) and the noncompensated electric force was equal

to 30, 46, 77, and 222% of the Casimir pressure at the same respective separations. This

means that the use of regular samples with no cleaning for manufacturing the microdevices

driven by the Casimir force and for measuring the Casimir interaction is seriously hindered

by electric forces due to the surface patches, contaminants etc.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

In the foregoing, we have investigated the impact of Ar-ion cleaning on the electrostatic

eﬀects arising between two closely spaced metallic surfaces in measurements of the Casimir

interaction. For this purpose, the previously created experimental setup using the dynamic

atomic force microscope was supplemented with an Ar-ion gun and the Ar reservoir. Our

experimental results demonstrate that when using regular uncleaned surfaces of a sphere and

a plate the residual potential diﬀerence between these surfaces is rather large in magnitude

and depends considerably on the separation distance, as it was repeatedly reported in pre-

9

vious literature (see Ref. [33] and references therein). We have also shown that suﬃciently

long Ar-ion cleaning diminishes the residual potential diﬀerence by up to an order of mag-

nitude and makes it less dependent on separation. Thus, for uncleaned surfaces the residual

electric pressures were determined to vary from 30% to 222% of the Casimir pressure when

separation varies from 235 to 700 nm. This is a serious obstacle for a regular application

of microdevices driven by the Casimir force and for measuring the Casimir interaction. By

contrast, after the Ar-ion cleaning the residual electric pressures vary from only 0.9% to

5.2% of the Casimir pressure in the same range of separations which leaves the Casimir

pressure as the dominant driver.

We have also measured the gradients of the Casimir force between Au surfaces of a sphere

and a plate and determined the respective Casimir pressures between two parallel plates for

the Ar-ion cleaned samples. The obtained results have been compared with the previously

performed most precise measurements using specially selected clean samples and with the-

oretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory.

It was found that, although the measurement

data from the Ar-ion cleaned samples are characterized by somewhat larger experimental

errors than that of the most precise experiments, it is in agreement with the latter and with

the Lifshitz theory using the plasma model for extrapolation of the optical data to zero

frequency. The theoretical predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model for the

extrapolation of the optical data are excluded by our measurements with the Ar-ion cleaned

samples over a wide separation region from 235 to 400 nm.

One can conclude that the method of in situ Ar-ion cleaning of the interacting surfaces

is eﬀective in reducing the residual potential diﬀerence and related electrostatic eﬀects and

therefore is a great resource for measuring the Casimir interaction and the wide use of

microdevices operated by the Casimir force.
