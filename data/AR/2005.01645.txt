We present the results on the radius of the neutron distribution in 40Ar, on the low-energy
value of the weak mixing angle, and on the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos obtained from
the analysis of the coherent neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering data in argon recently published
by the COHERENT collaboration, taking into account proper radiative corrections. We present
also the results of the combined analysis of the COHERENT argon and cesium-iodide data for the
determination of the low-energy value of the weak mixing angle and the electromagnetic properties
of neutrinos. In particular, the COHERENT argon data allow us to improve signiﬁcantly the only
existing laboratory bounds on the electric charge qµµ of the muon neutrino and on the transition
electric charge qµτ .

I.

INTRODUCTION

The observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) in cesium-iodide performed in 2017 by
the COHERENT experiment [1, 2] unlocked an innovative and powerful tool to study many and diverse physical
phenomena [3–12]. Recently, the COHERENT collaboration observed CEνNS for the ﬁrst time also in argon [13],
using a single-phase 24 kg liquid-argon (LAr) scintillation detector, with two independent analyses that prefer CEνNS
over the background-only null hypothesis with greater than 3 σ signiﬁcance. The experimental challenge behind this
analysis is the need to observe nuclear recoils with a very small kinetic energy Tnr of a few keV, and thus the need
of a low nuclear-recoil-energy threshold, in presence of a larger background, when compared to the cesium-iodide
case. This requirement is necessary for the coherent recoil of the nucleus which occurs for |(cid:126)q|R (cid:28) 1 [14], where
|(cid:126)q| (cid:39)
2M Tnr is the three-momentum transfer, R is the nuclear radius of a few fm, and M is the nuclear mass, of
about 40 GeV for argon nuclei. The observation in argon, which is the lightest nucleus for which CEνNS process has
been measured, allows to demonstrate the CEνNS cross-section dependence on the square of the number of neutrons
N 2, but it can also provide valuable information on nuclear physics, neutrino properties, physics beyond the standard
model (SM), and electroweak (EW) interactions.

√

In this paper, we present the bounds on diﬀerent parameters of the EW interaction and neutrino electromagnetic
properties obtained analyzing the new COHERENT Ar data and those obtained with a combined analysis of the
COHERENT CsI and Ar data, using the results of the analysis of the CsI data in Ref. [15]. During the completion of
this work, another analysis of this type appeared on arXiv [16], but the results are not comparable with ours because
we ﬁt the COHERENT Ar data, whereas the analysis of Ref [16] is not a ﬁt of the COHERENT Ar data, but a ﬁt
of the number of CEνNS events obtained by the COHERENT collaboration from the ﬁt of the data [13]. Such an
indirect analysis underestimates the systematic uncertainties, especially those due to the background that are not
taken into account.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section II we describe brieﬂy the CEνNS formalism used in our calculation
as well as the inputs employed for simulating the signal spectra. In Sections III and IV we derive, respectively, the
results on the average rms radius of the neutron distributions in Ar and on the weak mixing angle. In Sections V, VI,
and VII we present, respectively, the constraints on the neutrino charge radii, neutrino electric charges and magnetic
moments. Finally, in Section VIII we summarize the results of the paper.

are, respectively, the ρ parameter of electroweak interactions, the value of sin2ϑW at the scale of the Z-boson mass,
the value of the electromagnetic ﬁne-structure constant at the scale of the Z-boson mass, and the value of the strong
constant at the scale of the W -boson mass. The value of ˆαs(mW ) in Eq. (9) is the only measured one that we found
in the literature. It is in agreement with the PDG summary in Figure 9.5 of Ref. [21]. In any case, a precise value of
ˆαs(mW ) is not needed, because its contribution is practically negligible.

The terms in Eqs. (3) and (4) proportional to ˆαZ/ˆs2

Z, which in turn is proportional to the square of the charged-
current weak coupling constant, are due to box diagrams with W -boson propagators. The last term in Eq. (3) depends
on the ﬂavor (cid:96) of the interacting neutrino ν(cid:96) through the corresponding charged lepton mass m(cid:96). This term can be
interpreted as the contribution of the neutrino charge radius and is consistent with the expression of the neutrino
charge radius calculated in Refs. [23–25], that we will discuss in Section V.

Numerically, neglecting the small uncertainties, we obtain

In Eq. (1) FZ(|(cid:126)q|2) and FN (|(cid:126)q|2) are, respectively, the form factors of the proton and neutron distributions in the
nucleus. They are given by the Fourier transform of the corresponding nucleon distribution in the nucleus and describe
the loss of coherence for |(cid:126)q|Rp (cid:38) 1 and |(cid:126)q|Rn (cid:38) 1, where Rp and Rn are, respectively, the rms radii of the proton and
neutron distributions. For the two form factors one can use diﬀerent parameterizations. The three most popular ones
are the symmetrized Fermi [26], Helm [27], and Klein-Nystrand [28] parameterizations that give practically identical
results, as we have veriﬁed (see Figure 2). Here, we brieﬂy describe only the Helm parameterization (descriptions of
the other parameterizations can be found in several papers, for example in Refs. [3, 26, 29, 30]), that is given by

For the parameter s, that quantiﬁes the so-called surface thickness, we consider the value s = 0.9 fm which was
determined for the proton form factor of similar nuclei [31].

We determined the value of the rms proton distribution radius Rp from the value of the 40Ar charge radius measured

precisely in electromagnetic experiments [32, 33]:

From the experimental value of Rc in Eq. (15), we obtain

Rp = 3.448 ± 0.003 fm .

(17)

(18)

This is the value of the rms radius Rp that we used in our calculations.

Let us now consider the neutron distribution radius Rn that determines the neutron form factor FN (|(cid:126)q|2) in the
cross section in Eq. (1). Experimentally, the value of Rn is not known and we can get information on it from the ﬁt
of the COHERENT data, as discussed in Section III. However, in our analysis it would be unphysical to consider Rn
as a completely free parameter, because it is very plausible that the neutron distribution radius is larger than the
proton distribution radius Rp in Eq. (18), since the 40Ar nucleus has 22 neutrons and only 18 protons. In order to

check if this hypothesis is supported by the nuclear theory, we have calculated the proton and neutron radii with two
publicly available numerical codes: the Sky3D code [47] of nonrelativistic nuclear mean-ﬁeld models based on Skyrme
forces, and the DIRHB code [48] of relativistic self-consistent mean-ﬁeld models. Table I presents the results of the
calculation of the point-proton radius Rpoint
for diﬀerent nuclear interactions (the
codes can calculate only the point-nucleon distributions, that do not take into account the ﬁnite size of the nucleons).
From Table I one can see that Rpoint
in all the nuclear models that we have considered and the excess is
between 0.08 and 0.11 fm. Since

Therefore, in our analyses of the COHERENT Argon data we consider two cases:

Rn (cid:39) Rp + 0.1 fm .

Rn = 3.55 fm.

3.45 < Rn < 4 fm.

The CEνNS event rate in the COHERENT experiment [13] depends on the neutrino ﬂux dNν/dE produced from

with the normalization factor η = rNPOT/4πL2, where r = (9±0.9)×10−2 is the number of neutrinos per ﬂavor that are
produced for each proton-on-target (POT), NPOT = 13.7 × 1022 is the number of proton on target corresponding to a
total integrated beam power of 6.12 GW·hr and L = 27.5 m is the distance between the source and the COHERENT
Ar detector, called CENNS-10 [1]. The pions decay at rest (π+ → µ+ + νµ) producing νµ’s which arrive at the
COHERENT detector as a prompt signal within about 1.5 µs after protons-on-targets. The decay at rest of µ+
(µ+ → e+ + νe + ¯νµ) produces a delayed component of ¯νµ’s and νe’s, since they arrive at the detector in a relatively
longer time interval of about 10 µs. In order to extract the physical parameter of interest, the ﬁrst step is to simulate
the CEνNS signal at CENNS-10 as a function of the nuclear recoil energy. The theoretical CEνNS event number

where A(Tnr) is the energy-dependent reconstruction eﬃciency given in Fig. 3 in Ref. [13], Emin = (cid:112)M Tnr/2 and
Emax = mµ/2 ∼ 52.8 MeV, mµ being the muon mass, N (Ar) is the number of Ar atoms in the detector, and dNν
dE is
the neutrino ﬂux integrated over the experiment lifetime. Concerning the former element, we digitalise the eﬃciency
as a function of the electron-equivalent recoil energy Tee [keVee], which is subsequently transformed as a function of
the nuclear recoil energy Tnr [keVnr] thanks to the relation

Tee = fQ(Tnr)Tnr .

(27)

5

Here, fQ is the quenching factor, which is the ratio between the scintillation light emitted in nuclear and electron
recoils and determines the relation between the number of detected photoelectrons and the nuclear recoil kinetic energy.
Following Ref. [13], the quenching factor is parameterized as fQ(Tnr) = (0.246 ± 0.006 keVnr) + ((7.8 ± 0.9) × 10−4)Tnr
up to 125 keVnr, and kept constant for larger values. The value of N (Ar) is given by NA Mdet/MAr, where NA is
the Avogadro number, Mdet is the detector active mass equal to 24 kg and MAr = 39.96 g/mol is the molar mass of
40Ar. Actually, one should consider that atmospheric argon is contaminated by a small percentage of 36Ar and 38Ar,
namely F (36Ar) = 0.334% and F (38Ar) = 0.063%. However, since the amount of 36Ar and 38Ar is very small and the
uncertainties are large, in practice one gets the same results considering F (40Ar) = 100% and F (36Ar) = F (38Ar) = 0.
In Ref. [13] two independent analyses, labeled A and B, are described, that diﬀer mainly for the selection and
the treatment of the background. In the following, we will use the data coming from the analysis A, whose range
of interest of the nuclear recoil energy is [0, 120] keVee (corresponding to roughly [0, 350] keVnr), with 12 energy
bins of size equal to 10 keVee. We have also performed the analyses of the data corresponding to analysis B of the
COHERENT collaboration [13] described in appendix A, where we considered only the determination of the radius
of the nuclear neutron distribution and of the weak mixing angle.

In our analysis corresponding to analysis A of the COHERENT collaboration [13], we considered the least-squares

In Eq. (29), ηCEνNS, ηPBRN and ηLBRN are nuisance parameters which quantify, respectively, the systematic uncer-

standard deviations σCEνNS, σPBRN and σLBRN.

The COHERENT spectral data are shown in Figure 1(a) together with the best-ﬁt histogram obtained with the
CEνNS cross section of Eq. (1) and the neutron form factor corresponding to the minimal neutron distribution radius
Rn = 3.45 fm, that gives the larger CEνNS cross section for Rn in the range in Eq. (22). We obtained (χ2
S)min = 8.8
with 11 degrees of freedom, corresponding to an excellent 64% goodness of ﬁt. We tested also the case of full coherence,
i.e. without the suppression of the neutron and proton form factors, as done in the case of the COHERENT CsI
In this case, illustrated in Figure 1(b), the larger CEνNS cross section ﬁts slightly better the low-
data [3, 15].
energy data and the medium- and high-energy data are ﬁtted slightly better with a smaller background within the
uncertainties. Indeed, the full coherence (χ2
S)min is 7.0, that is smaller than the 8.8 obtained with the minimal neutron
distribution radius. However, we will not consider the full coherence in the rest of the paper, because we are not
aware of any physical mechanism that can justify the absence of the form-factor suppression corresponding to the
physical nucleon distributions in the nucleus.

III. RADIUS OF THE NUCLEAR NEUTRON DISTRIBUTION

The observation of CEνNS scattering in argon can be used to probe the nuclear neutron distribution [3, 4, 19, 49].
We ﬁtted the COHERENT data in order to determine the neutron rms radius Rn of Ar, considering for Rn the lower
bound in Eq. (22), without an upper bound.

can only put the following upper bounds on the value of 40Ar neutron distribution radius:

Rn(40Ar) < 4.2 (1σ), 6.2 (2σ), 10.8 (3σ) fm.

(34)

These bounds are in agreement with the nuclear model predictions in Table I, but unfortunately they are too weak
to allow us a selection of the models.

IV. WEAK MIXING ANGLE

The weak mixing angle is a fundamental parameter in the theory of the EW interactions and its experimental
determination provides a direct probe of physics phenomena not included in the SM, usually referred to as new
physics. In particular, low-energy determinations of ϑW oﬀer a unique role, complementary to those at high-energy,
being highly sensitive to extra Z (Z (cid:48)) bosons predicted in grand uniﬁed theories, technicolor models, supersymmetry
and string theories [50]. This underscores the need for improved experimental determinations of ϑW in the low-energy
regime.
We ﬁtted the COHERENT CENNS-10 data in order to determine the value of sin2 ϑW in Ar, considering Rn either

we get:

sin2 ϑW(Ar) = 0.31 ± 0.06 (1σ),+0.11

−0.13 (2σ),+0.18

−0.23 (3σ),

(35)

which is about 1.2σ above the SM prediction, sin2 ϑSM
W = 0.23857(5) [21]. The reason of this small discrepancy is
that a larger weak mixing angle increases the CEνNS cross section and it allows a better ﬁt of the low-energy bins
of the Ar data. Given the independence of sin2 ϑW on the value of Rn, in the following we will consider only the
S)min as a function of sin2 ϑW using the Helm
case with Rn ﬁxed. Figure 3 shows the comparison of ∆χ2 = χ2
parameterization for the neutron form factor.

Following the approach used in Ref. [15], where we improved the bounds on several physical quantities from the
analysis of the COHERENT CsI data [1] considering the improved quenching factor in Ref. [51], we derive here the
result for the weak mixing angle also exploiting the COHERENT CsI dataset. Fixing Rn(Cs) and Rn(I) to 5.01 fm
and 4.94 fm [52], respectively, we get

Finally, we performed a combined ﬁt of the CsI and Ar data. The value found for the weak mixing angle is

sin2 ϑW(CsI + Ar) = 0.26+0.04

−0.03 (1σ), ±0.07 (2σ), ±0.11 (3σ),

which is slightly more precise than the CsI result alone and in agreement within 1σ with the SM prediction. Unfor-
tunately, as it is possible to see in Figure 4, the uncertainty obtained for the weak mixing angle from COHERENT is
still very large when compared to the other determinations at low-momentum transfer.

V. NEUTRINO CHARGE RADII

The neutrino charge radii are the only electromagnetic properties of neutrinos that are nonzero in the Standard

Model of electroweak interactions. They are induced by radiative corrections, with the predicted values [23–25]

As discussed in Section II the contribution of the Standard Model charge radius of ν(cid:96) is taken into account by the
last term in the expression (3) of gp
V (ν(cid:96)). Here, we want to study the eﬀects of the neutrino charge radii in the CEνNS
data of the COHERENT experiment independently of the origin of the charge radii, that can have contributions both
from the Standard Model and from physics beyond the Standard Model. Therefore we consider the diﬀerential cross

the form in Eq. (43), that is the correct one for low-energy interactions because it depends only on measured low-
energy quantities. Moreover, one can notice that the electromagnetic interaction due to the charge radius must be
proportional to the electromagnetic ﬁne-structure constant α and must be independent of the Fermi weak interaction
constant GF. Indeed, the GF in the denominator of Eq. (43) cancels the GF in the cross section (42).

The bounds in Table II obtained from the COHERENT Ar data are compatible, but less stringent than those
obtained from the CsI data, and the bounds of the combined ﬁt are similar to those obtained with the CsI data
only. This is illustrated by Figure 5, that depicts the allowed regions in diﬀerent planes of the parameter space of the

in the vicinity of the Standard Model values of the diagonal charge radii given in Eqs. (40) and (41) and shown by
the white cross near the origin in Figure 5(d). In the combined ﬁt, the point corresponding to the Standard Model
values of the diagonal charge radii lies at the edge of the 1σ allowed region. The best ﬁt of the COHERENT Ar
data is obtained for relatively large values of the charge radii shown by the blue crosses in Figure 5. As shown in
Figure 6, the resulting enhancement of the CEνNS cross section with respect to the SM allows a better ﬁt of the
low-energy data, while the medium- and high-energy data are ﬁtted better with a slightly lower background allowed
(cid:105) and (cid:104)r2

precision, but it is interesting to see that they tend to favor negative values of the charge radii.

We considered also the case of absence of the neutrino transition charge radii, that is motivated by the attempt
to probe the values of the neutrino charge radii in the Standard Model, where only the diagonal charge radii with
the values in Eqs. (40) and (41) exist.
It is also possible that the physics beyond the Standard Model generates
oﬀ-diagonal neutrino charge radii that are much smaller than the diagonal charge radii and can be neglected in a ﬁrst
approximation. Figure 7 shows the allowed regions in the ((cid:104)r2
(cid:105)) plane. One can see that the contribution of
νe
the Ar data leads to a restriction of the allowed regions. Although the combined ﬁt tends to favor the allowed island
at large negative values of (cid:104)r2
(cid:105), we cannot consider it as possible, because it lies well outside the black rectangle near
νµ
the origin that shows the 90% bounds of the TEXONO [65] and BNL-E734 [66] experiments. The allowed island of
the combined CsI and Ar analysis for values of (cid:104)r2

well as with the Standard Model values of the neutrino charge radii.

VI. NEUTRINO ELECTRIC CHARGES

As discussed in Ref. [10], the CEνNS process is sensitive not only to the neutrino charge radii, but also to the
neutrino electric charges. Usually neutrinos are considered as exactly neutral particles, but in theories beyond the SM
they can have small electric charges (often called millicharges). This possibility was considered in many experimental
and theoretical studies (see the review in Ref. [59]).

spectral Ar data of the COHERENT experiment [13] and those obtained with a combined ﬁt of the CsI and Ar data.
We also revise the CsI limits on the electric charges presented in Ref. [15] because they have been obtained through
an expression similar to that in Eq. (44) (see Eq. (30) of Ref. [15]), that overestimates their contribution by about
10%, as discussed in Section V for the charge radii.

There are ﬁve electric charges that can be determined with the COHERENT CEνNS data: the two diagonal electric

charges qνee and qνµµ, and the absolute values of the three transition electric charges qνeµ = q∗

, qνeτ , and qνµτ .

The results of our ﬁts for ﬁxed and free Rn are given in Table III. Since the bounds are similar in the two cases, in
Figure 8 we show only the allowed regions in diﬀerent planes of the neutrino electric charge parameter space obtained
with ﬁxed Rn.

From Table III and Figure 8 one can see that the COHERENT Ar data allow us to put slightly more stringent
limits on the neutrino electric charges than the CsI data, in spite of the larger uncertainties. The larger sensitivity
of the Ar data to the electric charges is in contrast with the smaller sensitivity to the charge radii discussed in
Section V. It follows from the enhancement of the neutrino electric charge eﬀect in CEνNS at low q2, because of the
denominator in Eq. (46). Since q2 = −2M Tnr, light nuclei are more sensitive than heavier ones at the neutrino electric
charges for similar nuclear recoil kinetic energies Tnr. The acceptance functions of both the CsI and Ar experiments
have a threshold of about 5 keVnr. Since M (40Ar) (cid:39) 37 GeV, M (133Cs) (cid:39) 123 GeV, and M (127I) (cid:39) 118 GeV, the
minimum value of |q2| can be about 3.2 times smaller in the Ar experiment than in the CsI experiment. However, this
enhancement of a factor as large as 3.2 of the neutrino electric charge eﬀect for nuclear recoil kinetic energies above
the experimental threshold is mitigated by the diﬀerent sizes of the energy bins: in the Ar experiment the ﬁrst bin
includes energies from the threshold to about 36 keVnr, whereas the CsI energy bins have a size of about 1.7 keVnr.
Therefore, the enhancement of the electric charge eﬀect occurs only in the ﬁrst energy bin of the Ar experiment.
Nevertheless, this enhancement is suﬃcient for achieving a slightly better performance of the Ar data in constraining
the neutrino electric charges in spite of the larger uncertainties, as can be seen in Table III and Figure 8.

The combined ﬁt of the COHERENT CsI and Ar data leads to a signiﬁcant restriction of the allowed values of the
neutrino electric charges, especially the diagonal ones, because of the incomplete overlap of the CsI and Ar allowed
regions that can be seen in Figure 8(d). Although the best-ﬁt values of qνee and qνµµ are visibly diﬀerent from zero, the
deviation is not signiﬁcant, because the 1σ allowed region includes well the point qνee = qνµµ = 0. From Figures 8(a),
8(b), and 8(c), one can see that the best-ﬁt values of the oﬀ-diagonal electric charges are close to zero and the values
of the oﬀ-diagonal electric charges are well constrained.

As already noted in Ref. [15], the bounds of the order of 10−7 e that we obtained are not competitive with the
bounds on the electron neutrino electric charges obtained in reactor neutrino experiments, that are at the level of
10−12 e [21, 59, 67, 68]. These limits are given in the literature for the diagonal electron neutrino charge qνee , because
the contribution of the oﬀ-diagonal charges was not considered. However, since the oﬀ-diagonal charges contribute
to the cross section in a quantitatively comparable way, we can consider them to be bounded at the same order of

On the other hand, they are the only existing laboratory bounds for qνµµ and qνµτ .

VII. NEUTRINO MAGNETIC MOMENTS

The neutrino magnetic moment is the electromagnetic neutrino property that is most studied and searched ex-
perimentally. The reason is that its existence is predicted by many models beyond the Standard Model, especially
those that include right-handed neutrinos. It is also phenomenologically important for astrophysics because neutrinos
with a magnetic moment can interact with astrophysical magnetic ﬁelds leading to several important eﬀects (see the
reviews in Refs. [59, 69]).

The CEνNS process is sensitive to neutrino magnetic moments [7, 15, 29, 30, 70, 71]. In this Section, we present
the bounds on the neutrino magnetic moments that we obtained from the analysis of the COHERENT Ar data and
those that we obtained from the combined ﬁt of the COHERENT CsI and Ar data.

For the analysis of the COHERENT data we used the least-squares function in Eq. (29), with the theoretical
calculated by adding to the Standard Model weak cross section in Eq. (1) the magnetic moment

where me is the electron neutrino mass, µν(cid:96) is the eﬀective magnetic moment of the ﬂavor neutrino ν(cid:96) in elastic
scattering (see Ref. [59]), and µB is the Bohr magneton.

The results of the ﬁts for ﬁxed and free Rn are given in Table IV. Again, one can see that the bounds are robust
with respect to our lack of knowledge of the value of Rn, because the bounds are similar for ﬁxed and free Rn. For
simplicity, in Figure 9(a) we show only the allowed regions in the (|µνe |, |µνµ|) plane obtained with ﬁxed Rn.

From Figure 9(a) one can see that the best ﬁt of the Ar data is obtained for relatively large values of the neutrino
magnetic moments. The reason is similar to that discussed in Section V for the neutrino charge radii: as illustrated

in Figure 9(b), the enhancement of the CEνNS cross section with a sizable neutrino magnetic moment contribution
ﬁts better the low-energy bins of the Ar data set than the SM cross section and the medium- and high-energy bins are
ﬁtted better with a slightly smaller background allowed by the uncertainties. In the combined CsI and Ar analysis we
ﬁnd the best ﬁt for |µνe | = 0, but a best-ﬁt value of |µνµ| that is relatively large. However, we cannot consider this
as a valid indication in favor of a non-zero |µνµ | because the best-ﬁt value is much larger than the bounds obtained
in accelerator experiments with νµ − e scattering (see Table IV of Ref. [59]). The most stringent of those bounds is
the LSND bound |µνµ| < 6.8 × 10−10 µB at 90% CL [72] shown in Figure 9(a). Nevertheless, the 1σ allowed region of
the combined ﬁt is compatible with this bound, as well as with the stringent bounds on |µνe | established in reactor
neutrino experiments (the currently best one, |µνe| < 2.9 × 10−11 µB [21, 59, 73], is not shown in Figure 9(a) because
it would not be distinguishable from the y axis).

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we discussed the information on nuclear physics, on the low-energy electroweak mixing angle and
on the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos that can be obtained from the analysis of the recent CEνNS data on
argon of the COHERENT experiment [13]. We also presented the results obtained by combining the analysis of the
COHERENT Ar data with the analysis of the COHERENT CsI data [1] performed in Ref. [15].

The information on nuclear physics provided by CEνNS measurements concerns the radius of the neutron distribu-
tion in the target nucleus. In Section III we calculated the bounds on the radius of the neutron distribution in 40Ar.
These bounds are in agreement with the nuclear model predictions in Table I, but are rather weak, because the data
have large uncertainties. Therefore, they do not allow us to discriminate the diﬀerent nuclear models.

For the low-energy weak mixing angle, from the analysis of the COHERENT Ar data we obtained a relatively
large value which, however, is compatible with that predicted by the Standard Model at about 1.7σ. Including in the
analysis the COHERENT CsI data, we found a value that is still larger than that predicted by the Standard Model,
but compatible at about 1σ.

The analysis of the COHERENT Ar data allows us to constrain the neutrino charge radii and magnetic moments,
but not as well as the analysis of the COHERENT CsI data. Therefore, the combined ﬁts are dominated by the CsI
data, with small changes due to the Ar data with respect to the results obtained in Ref. [15]. On the other hand, the
Ar data are more sensitive to the neutrino electric charges than the CsI data because of the lower nuclear mass, as
discussed in Section VI. Therefore, the Ar data allowed us to improve the constraints on the neutrino electric charges
that can be obtained with CEνNS. In particular, we improved the only existing laboratory bounds on the electric
charge qµµ of the muon neutrino and on the transition electric charge qµτ .

In conclusion, we would like to emphasize the importance of the results of the COHERENT experiment, that opened
the way for CEνNS measurements, ﬁrst with the CsI detector [1] and then with the LAr detector [13]. Even if the
ﬁrst CEνNS data on argon have large uncertainties, they give us useful physical information. We believe that future
experimental improvements will lead to far-reaching results.

Appendix A: Results obtained with the analysis B

In Sections III and IV, the radius of the nuclear neutron distribution and the electroweak mixing angle have been
studied using the so-called analysis A of CENNS-10 data [13], whose selection criteria allow to put more stringent
constraints on the parameters of interest. For completeness, here we present the results obtained using the same
ﬁtting procedure developed in Sections III and IV using the data of the CENNS-10 analysis B, in order to check
the compatibility and stability of the results. These two diﬀerent data sets are obtained from the same data-taking
campaign and share most of the selection procedure, leading to have most of the data in common. Thus, any attempt
to combine the results of analyses A and B in order to obtain a more precise measurement of the physics parameters
should be discarded, given the large overlap between the two.

In contrast to analysis A, the slightly diﬀerent selection in analysis B results into a modiﬁed eﬃciency that is below
the eﬃciency of analysis A except for a small region between 4 keVee and 5 keVee. In addition, the region of interest
of the analysis B is restricted to [4, 30] keVee, that corresponds roughly to the CEνNS signal energy region. The
results are presented using 13 bins of 2 keVee each. Another diﬀerence is that, in analysis B, the delayed component
of BRN is not included, thus the background has a single component, BBRN.

where these quantities have been introduced in Section III. We notice that the systematic uncertainties of analysis
B are smaller with respect to analysis A and the energy resolution is better. On the other hand, since the selection
performed in analysis B is tighter, the number of expected CEνNS events is smaller and the resulting uncertainty is
larger than analysis A. Fixing the value of the weak mixing angle to the SM one, sin2 ϑW = 0.23857 [21], and ﬁtting
the radius of the nuclear neutron distribution Rn, constraining it to be Rn > Rp, we ﬁnd

Rn(40Ar) < 7.4 (1σ), 10.55 (90% CL) fm.

Figure 10(a) shows the ∆χ2 as a function of the neutron rms radius Rn for analysis B. Even though a minimum is
found at Rn = 4.36 fm, the large uncertainty allows only to set limits on the neutron rms radius, which are much
weaker than those obtained with the analysis A.

Similarly, we determined the value of sin2 ϑW ﬁxing Rn. This choice does not impact signiﬁcantly the result, since
it has been veriﬁed that the extracted value of the weak mixing angle is largely uncorrelated with Rn. Under these
assumptions, we obtain

sin2 ϑW = 0.22+0.07

−0.09 (1σ)+0.11

−0.17 (90 CL).

(A7)

This value is consistent with the SM prediction and with the best ﬁt obtained using analysis A, but a much larger
uncertainty is obtained.2 Figure 10(b) shows the ∆χ2 as a function of the weak mixing angle for analysis B.

2 To better judge the consistency one should know the overlap, in terms of number of events, between the two analyses, but this information

is missing in Ref. [13].
