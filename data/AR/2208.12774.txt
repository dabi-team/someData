ABSTRACT

Forecasting solar energetic particles (SEPs), and identifying ﬂare/CMEs from active regions (ARs)
that will produce SEP events in advance is extremely challenging. We investigate the magnetic ﬁeld
environment of AR 12673, including the AR’s magnetic conﬁguration, the surrounding ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tion in the vicinity of the AR, the decay index proﬁle, and the footpoints of Earth-connected magnetic
ﬁeld, around the time of four eruptive events. Two of the eruptive events are SEP-productive (2017
September 4 at 20:00 UT and September 6 at 11:56 UT), while two are not (September 4 at 18:05 UT
and September 7 at 14:33 UT). We analysed a range of EUV and white-light coronagraph observations
along with potential ﬁeld extrapolations and ﬁnd that the CMEs associated with the SEP-productive
events either trigger null point reconnection that redirects ﬂare-accelerated particles from the ﬂare
site to the Earth-connected ﬁeld and/or have a signiﬁcant expansion (and shock formation) into the
open Earth-connected ﬁeld. The rate of change of the decay index with height indicates that the
region could produce a fast CME (v > 1500 km s−1), which it did during events two and three. The
AR’s magnetic ﬁeld environment, including locations of open magnetic ﬁeld and null points along with
the magnetic ﬁeld connectivity and propagation direction of the CMEs play an important role in the
escape and arrival of SEPs at Earth. Other SEP-productive ARs should be investigated to determine
whether their magnetic ﬁeld environment and CME propagation direction are signiﬁcant in the escape
and arrival of SEPs at Earth.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Sun sporadically accelerates particles (electrons,
protons and heavy ions) to near-relativistic speeds and
energies of 10 keV to GeV during activity events such as
solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These

particles are termed solar energetic particles (SEPs).
The acceleration processes are thought to be related to
the electric ﬁelds or plasma turbulence associated with
the magnetic reconnection involved in solar ﬂares that
energise the thermal plasma to suprathermal levels (see
Vlahos et al. 2019, for a review). For example, SEP
production is correlated with ﬂare thermal energy, with
all ﬂares with a GOES soft X-ray classiﬁcation greater
than X5, and located in the solar longitude range W15
to W75, being SEP productive (Belov et al. 2005).

The most energetic ﬂares have a high likelihood of
being accompanied by a CME (Yashiro et al. 2005) and
correlations have been found between certain CME char-
acteristics and SEP production. For example, CME ac-
celeration and spatial extent have been shown to inﬂu-
ence the production and spread of SEPs (Kahler et al.
1986) and CME energy is correlated to peak SEP in-
tensity (Kahler & Vourlidas 2013). The mechanism by
which CMEs are capable of producing SEPs is through
the shocks that are created by super-Alfv´enic CMEs
as they move through the lower corona and into the
solar wind (Reames 1999; Kahler 2001; Gopalswamy
et al. 2004; Papaioannou et al. 2016), injecting shock-
accelerated particles onto observer-connected ﬁeld lines.
Regardless of the SEP acceleration mechanism, accel-
erated particles escape the Sun by propagating along
open ﬁeld lines that guide the particles as they move
through the heliosphere. SEP studies utilising data from
spacecraft at diﬀerent solar longitudes have shown that
the largest SEP intensities are detected at those space-
craft that are well connected to the solar activity event
(Dresing et al. 2014; Lario et al. 2013). Therefore, Earth
impacting SEPs must either originate on, diﬀuse onto,
or have access to as a result of magnetic reconnection,
magnetic ﬁeld lines that connect from the Sun to the
Earth. Currently, the source of SEP seed populations,
the method by which particles escape from their accel-
eration region, and the SEP proﬁle variation from event
to event in relation to source region characteristics are
still not yet well understood (Desai & Giacalone 2016).
For example, the standard CSHKP model of solar ﬂares
(Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp
& Pneuman 1976) injects reconnection-accelerated par-
ticles downward to produce heating in the lower atmo-
spheric plasma and the ﬂare, but also injects particles
upward. However, these upward-accelerated particles
are injected onto the closed ﬁeld lines of the escaping
CME and therefore the escape routes for the SEPs are
not easily explained.

It is possible to investigate the escape of SEPs by ﬁrst
identifying their solar origin. A key technique for this
involves analysing the elemental composition of the SEP
plasma population as measured in situ and then seek-
ing plasma with the same composition in the ﬂare/CME
source region. Elemental composition is normally char-
acterised by considering elements with diﬀering ﬁrst ion-
isation potentials (FIP), comparing low-FIP to high-FIP
elements, such as Si and S, and comparing coronal abun-
dances to that of the photosphere. This has emerged as
a key diagnostic in the study of SEP plasma (Reames
2018). Recently, this approach has been used to trace
multiple SEP events detected near Earth during Jan-

uary 2014 back to their solar source (Brooks & Yardley
2021a). The results showed that plasma conﬁned by
strong magnetic ﬁelds in the active region (AR) devel-
oped the composition signature (high Si/S abundance
ratio) indicative of the SEP population. Smaller Si/S
abundance enhancements were also recorded close to up-
ﬂow regions at the AR boundary. The plasma detected
in situ during the SEP events was therefore determined
to be a combination of plasma that was accelerated and
released during the ﬂare/CME itself, that escaped di-
rectly along open magnetic ﬁeld lines, and also plasma
that escaped indirectly through interchange reconnec-
tion at the AR periphery (Brooks & Yardley 2021b;
Yardley et al. 2021).

It is clear that the conﬁguration of an AR’s magnetic
ﬁeld, and the conﬁguration of its surroundings, plays a
key role in both particle acceleration and escape. The
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration inﬂuences where ﬂare recon-
nection may occur, how much energy can be released,
and over what timescale. The magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tion also aﬀects CME acceleration, speed and propaga-
tion direction. Therefore, the magnetic conﬁguration of
an AR and its surrounding ﬁeld must be investigated
in SEP studies. Determining whether there are cer-
tain characteristics of an AR’s magnetic ﬁeld or of the
surrounding ﬁeld that are necessary for SEP-production
and escape would therefore mark a step towards being
able to forecast which regions might produce observer-
impacting SEP events.

For the speciﬁc case of CMEs that are initiated by
an unstable ﬂux rope (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006), the pre-
eruptive (and therefore stable) conﬁguration is obtained
when the upward Lorentz force of the rope is balanced
by the downward strapping force of the overlying arcade.
The ﬂux rope will become unstable if it reaches a height
at which the downward force of the overlying strapping
is insuﬃcient. This height is known as the critical height
and the gradient of the strapping ﬁeld is given by the
decay index (Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006). Once unstable, the
decay index proﬁle will inﬂuence the acceleration of the
CME, and its terminal velocity. A study by Kliem et al.
(2021) suggests there is a correlation between the steep-
ness of the decay index height proﬁle (above the critical
height) and the CME velocity for CMEs with speeds
(cid:62)1500 km s−1.

In this paper, we focus on the evolution of the well-
studied NOAA AR 12673 during its disk passage (Sun
& Norton 2017; Yang et al. 2017; Chertok et al. 2018;
Cohen & Mewaldt 2018; Luhmann et al. 2018; Romano
et al. 2018; Sharykin & Kosovichev 2018; Shen et al.
2018; Wang et al. 2018; Anﬁnogentov et al. 2019; Bruno
et al. 2019; Romano et al. 2019), which was the site of

several M and X-class ﬂares, and fast CMEs between
2017 September 4 until it passed out of view over the
west limb on 2017 September 10. Two SEP events and
a further SEP event that produced a ground-level en-
hancement were produced in association with this activ-
ity, as described in Bruno et al. (2019). Two SEP events
occurred while the AR was visible on disk from the Earth
perspective, and within 50W of central meridian. We
aim to determine the role of the magnetic ﬁeld environ-
ment of the AR and its surroundings in enabling these
two ﬂare/CME events to produce SEP events that were
detected at Earth, whereas other major ﬂares/CMEs
from the AR were not. We probe whether there are
certain characteristics of the AR magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgu-
ration, and its surrounding magnetic environment, that
inﬂuence the production and escape of SEPs in a subset
of the major ﬂare/CME events produced by the AR. In
contrast to previous studies, we analyse both the SEP
and non-SEP productive events.

2. EVOLUTION OF NOAA ACTIVE REGION 12673

NOAA active region (AR) 12673 appeared on the east
solar limb on 28 August 2017, consisting of a lone posi-
tive polarity sunspot with dispersed positive (negative)
polarity ﬁeld to the north-west (south-east). This pos-
itive polarity spot was present in previous rotations as
part of AR 12670 and AR 12665 (which also produced
two SEP events). Major ﬂux emergence began in the
region on 2017 September 2 and as a consequence, the
AR evolved rapidly, from an α to a βγδ Hale-class by
September 5 (Figure 1 a). The region was recorded to
have had one of the fastest rates of emerging ﬂux ever
observed (Sun & Norton 2017).

The AR ﬁrst started ﬂaring early on 2017 September
4 and produced its ﬁrst CME later that day, which was
observed to begin around 18:00 UT. In total, AR 12673
was the source of 27 GOES M- and four X-class ﬂares,
eleven CMEs and three SEP events during the time pe-
riod 2017 September 4–10. Figure 1 (b) shows the two
SEP events that occurred as detected by GOES when
the AR was less than 50W of central meridian.

In the next section, we focus on analysing the prop-
erties of a subset of eruptive ﬂares from this AR (be-
tween 2017 September 4 and 7), which are both SEP-
productive and non-SEP productive, in order to try to
distinguish these two types of eruptive events.

3. SEP AND NON-SEP FLARE/CME

PRODUCTIVE EVENTS

In this study, we focus on four eruptive events (ﬂares
and their associated CMEs) that occur between 2017
September 4 and 7, when the AR was no greater than

50W of central meridian. Details of the ﬂare and CME
properties are given in Table 1. The SEP productive
events (events two and three) are temporally associated
with an M5.5 GOES class ﬂare on 2017 September 4 and
a X9.3 GOES class ﬂare on 2017 September 6. GOES 13
and 15 data show that particles from September 4 SEP
event arrived at the spacecraft by 22:30 UT on the same
day and on September 6 the particles of the SEP event
were detected by 12:35 UT. Energy spectra of both SEP
events were relatively soft, with the data from the 2017
September 4 event suggestive of a post-eruption origin
(Chertok 2018; Chertok et al. 2018). In the following,
a brief description of each eruptive event is given, in-
cluding the location and development of ﬂare ribbons
(“active PILs”), CME propagation direction and radial
speed, and sites of magnetic reconnection as evidenced
by the ﬂaring and EUV observations. In total, four ac-
tive PILs are identiﬁed in the AR along which ﬂare rib-
bons are observed, three of which are aligned almost
north-south (PILs 1, 2, and 3 in Figure 2 b) and one
aligned east-west (PIL 4). The AR evolves so that on
September 7 only one active PIL is remaining (PIL 3).

3.1. Eruptive Event 1

Event one occurred on 2017 September 4 and com-
prises of an M1.0 GOES class ﬂare that occurred in asso-
ciation with a CME. No SEPs were detected in associa-
tion with this event. Flare ribbons are initially observed
along PIL 2, but an overlap with ribbons along this PIL
from a ﬂare just minutes before hinders the ability to
discriminate which ﬂare is responsible for these ribbons.
As seen in AIA 1600 ˚A, ﬂare ribbons are forming along
PILs 3 and 4 by 18:16 UT on 2017 September 4, which
is temporally coincident with the initial increase in the
GOES soft X-ray light curve for this ﬂare (see Figure 2
panels a and b). At the peak of the ﬂare, as determined
from the GOES soft X-ray emission (18:21 UT), the ﬂare
ribbons are mainly observed along PIL 4. The eruption
begins at around ∼18:05 UT as observed by the expan-
sion and propagation of coronal loops to the south-west,
visible in the SDO/AIA 171 ˚A and running diﬀerence
images (Figure 2 c). The CME (Figure 2 d) is ﬁrst seen
in LASCO/C2 data at 19:00 UT on September 4 and
has a radial speed of 973 km s−1 (calculated using the
STEREOCAT tool1). The CME propagation direction
in 3D is S06W28 (taken from the DONKI catalogue2),
which is to the west of the radial direction of the AR.

Figure 1. Panel (a) shows the radial photospheric magnetic ﬁeld of AR 12673 taken by the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager on
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012). The radial magnetic ﬁeld component is from the HMI
SHARP data series (Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch; Bobra et al. 2014) where positive (negative) ﬁeld is represented
by white (black), respectively, saturated at ±500 G. Panel (b) displays the GOES-13 proton ﬂux (10, 30, 60 MeV channels)
with two SEP events detected on 2017 September 4 and 6. The black dashed line represents the 10 MeV warning threshold
above which a proton event alert is issued by NOAA/SWPC. The purple dashed lines indicate the start times of the two SEP
events, which are 2017 September 4 at 22:30 UT and 2017 September 6 at 12:35 UT, respectively.

Event two also occurs on 2017 September 4 and com-
prises of an M5.5 GOES class ﬂare that occurred in
association with a CME and the production of SEPs.
Flare ribbons are ﬁrst observed (faintly) at ∼20:11 UT
on 2017 September 4 in the AIA 1600 ˚A waveband, ini-
tially appearing along PIL 1. The ribbons then spread
across PILs 4, 3 and then 2. At the peak of the ﬂare’s
soft X-ray emission (20:32 UT) the 1600 ˚A waveband
ﬂare ribbons are most intense across PIL 2 (see Fig-
ure 3 panels a and b). Reverse S-shaped coronal loops

are observed to erupt to the north-west from 20:00 UT
onwards, which drives reconnection at what looks like a
null point, as evidenced by the 171 ˚A and running diﬀer-
ence images, located north-east of the AR (Figure 3 c).
The associated CME is ﬁrst seen in LASCO/C2 (ap-
pearing to the south) on 2017 September 4 at 20:36 UT.
The eruption direction in 3D is S10W10 (from DONKI),
which is north of the radial direction of the AR, and is
super-imposed on the previous CME from the region
that occurred during event one (Figure 3 d). However,

(a)(b)(a)Magnetic environment of SEP-productive AR12673

the CME is also observed to have a component propagat-
ing to the east as seen in the coronagraph ﬁeld-of-view.
The CME’s radial speed is calculated to be 2153 km s−1
(from the STEREOCAT tool). A type II radio burst

was observed in association with this event (as recorded
by the WIND/WAVES catalogue3 Gopalswamy et al.
2019). The SEP event is ﬁrst detected in the GOES
data at 22:30 UT.

Note—The ﬁrst three columns give the event number (1–4), the latitude and longitude that the eruptive event originates from. Columns four and
ﬁve give the start and peak time of the solar ﬂares as derived from the GOES soft X-ray ﬂux. Columns six and seven give the time of the CME
onset as observed in the SDO/AIA 171 ˚A data, and the time the CME was ﬁrst observed in SoHO LASCO/C2. Columns eight and nine give
the half width and the radial velocity as determined by the STEREOCAT tool. The ensemble mode is used and the median of 5 diﬀerent speed
measurements, calculated using LASCO/C2 and STEREO-A/COR2, is taken. The propagation direction of the CME is given in column ten,
which is taken from the DONKI catalogue. Finally, column eleven states whether the event was associated with SEPs as detected by GOES.

3.3. Eruptive Event 3

Event three occurred on 2017 September 6 and com-
prises an X9.3 GOES class ﬂare that occurred in as-
sociation with a CME and an SEP event. Flare rib-
bons are ﬁrst observed ∼11:53 UT on September 6 in
AIA 1600 ˚A waveband data along PIL 3 and then PIL
4. By September 6 the AR has evolved to have two
main PILs (3 & 4, see Figure 4 b). Flare ribbons ap-
pear and are strongest around PIL 3 at the peak of the
ﬂare (12:01 UT) but also spread to PIL 4 (Figure 4 a).
The eruption associated with the ﬂare, as observed in
EUV imaging data of the lower corona, is quite com-
plex. Three diﬀerent structures are observed to prop-
agate outwards from the AR (black arrows shown in
Figure 4 c). The ﬁrst is a loop structure, aligned north
south with respect to the AR, located at the east of
the AR. The second and third loop structures originate
from the western side of the AR. These loop structures
(2 & 3), which erupt around the same time as the ﬁrst
loop structure, propagate to the south-west and north-
west, respectively (see Figure 4 c). As a result, a halo
CME was observed, with a radial speed of 2268 km s−1,
which was ﬁrst observed in LASCO/C2 at 12:24 UT
on September 6. The CME propagated in the direction
S15W23, which is to the east of the radial direction from

3 https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME list/radio/waves type2.html

the AR. A type II burst was observed in association with
this event. The SEP event is ﬁrst detected in the GOES
data at 12:35 UT.

3.4. Eruptive Event 4

Event four begins on September 7 at 14:31 UT and
is not associated with an SEP event. The AR is al-
most at 50W at this time with projection eﬀects start-
ing to become more evident. By this time, the AR has
evolved to have only one main PIL (3, Figure 5 b), which
has changed orientation mainly due to shearing motions.
The ﬂare ribbons are therefore observed along PIL 3 and
do not evolve into multiple ribbons (Figure 5 a). The
erupting loop structure is diﬃcult to identify directly
in this case but there are nearby loops that visibly os-
cillate due to the propagation of an erupting structure
(Figure 5 c). The eruption is indirectly observed to be-
gin around 14:33 UT. A narrow CME is ﬁrst observed
in LASCO/C2 at 15:24 UT with a radial speed of 481
km s−1. The CME propagation direction is S16W53,
which is to the south-west of the AR radial.

4. LOCAL MAGNETIC FIELD CONFIGURATION

In this section, aspects of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁg-
uration of NOAA active region (AR) 12673, the mag-
netic conﬁguration in the vicinity of the AR and the
footpoints of the Earth-connected ﬁeld during this time
period are discussed. The decay index in the region is
presented in relation to investigating CME velocity, but
no detailed magnetic ﬁeld analysis can be carried out
since only a potential ﬁeld model is used. The magnetic

ﬁeld conﬁguration local to the AR (i.e.
connectivity
to the immediate surroundings) is analysed in order to
investigate the escape of particles from the AR, which
are accelerated during ﬂare reconnection processes, and
the Earth-connected ﬁelds lines are analysed in order to
investigate the processes which may inject and acceler-
ate particles towards the Earth. Two diﬀerent poten-
tial ﬁeld models are used for the analysis of the decay
index proﬁle and to investigate the magnetic ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration in the vicinity of the AR. The extrapolation
methods are also described in this section.

4.1. Active region decay index height proﬁle

A study by Kliem et al. (2021) showed that the height
proﬁle of the decay index above the critical height (i.e.
the height at which the torus instability sets in for
eruptive ﬂux ropes) may correlate with CME velocity
in the cases of fast CMEs (with velocity greater than
1500 km s−1). A similar analysis is followed here. The
value of this approach is that if the correlation is found
to hold, it enables a pre-event investigation of which
CMEs may be of suﬃciently high speed that they drive
shocks as they propagate. Hence, these CMEs could
be SEP-productive. Potential ﬁeld models are suﬃcient
for the analysis of the height proﬁle of the decay in-
dex (whereas a full treatment of the AR, which contains
complexity and free magnetic energy, requires the con-
struction of a non-linear model).

Potential ﬁeld models of NOAA AR 12673 are cre-
ated by extrapolating linear ﬁelds using the method of
Alissandrakis (1981) with the force-free parameter set
to zero (i.e. current-free). The radial ﬁeld component
of photospheric magnetograms from the HMI (Scherrer
et al. 2012) SHARP data series (Spaceweather HMI Ac-
tive Region Patch; Bobra et al. 2014) taken around the
onset time of each event are used as the lower bound-
ary of each extrapolation. The magnetograms are spa-
tially downsized by a factor of 2, meaning that each
pixel in the extrapolation volume represents approxi-
mately 0.725 Mm in each spatial dimension. The height
of the extrapolation volume is chosen as 451 pixels, or
approximately 327 Mm (0.47 R(cid:12)).

Once the potential ﬁeld model has been created, the
decay index is computed. The poloidal component of
the magnetic ﬁeld is used in the decay index calculation
(Kliem & T¨or¨ok 2006; James et al. 2022), which is ap-
proximated in this study by using the ﬁeld component
that is transverse to the PIL along which the ﬂare rib-
bons are observed (Btr = (cid:112)(Bx2 + By2)). Pixels are
selected in the lower boundary of the extrapolation that
correspond to the “active” photospheric PILs associated
with each ﬂare. The mean value of the decay index along
this “active” PIL is then computed at each height layer
in the extrapolation.

The critical height, hcrit, is deﬁned as the height of
the lowest layer in the extrapolation in which the mean
decay index is greater than the critical decay index,
ncrit. However, any critical heights in the lowest 9 layers
(3.26 Mm) of the volume are discounted as these values
are generally a result of noise in the boundary magne-
togram. Bateman (1978) found a theoretical critical de-
cay index of 1.5, however observational and theoretical
studies have determined values of 1 < ncrit < 2 (T¨or¨ok
& Kliem 2007; Fan & Gibson 2007; D´emoulin & Aulanier
2010). Kliem et al. (2021) tested various values of the
critical decay index and compared observed CME speeds
to gradients of the decay index measured over diﬀerent
height ranges above the critical height. They found the
strongest correlation between CME speeds and gradi-
ents of the decay index when the critical decay index
was taken as ncrit = 1.7 and the gradients were calcu-
lated over a range of 1-1.6 times the critical height. In
this study, the values used by Kliem et al. (2021) are
adopted i.e., ncrit = 1.7 and decay index gradients com-
puted over the relative range of (1-1.6)hcrit.

The critical height hcrit and the gradient of the decay
index dn/dh were calculated (see Table 2) for the four
active PILs for which ﬂare ribbons were observed during
the four eruptive events (Figures 2–5). At PILs 3 and 4
it can be seen that hcrit increases and dn/dh decreases
with time. During events one and two, the minimum
hcrit and maximum dn/dh occur at PIL 3. During event
three hcrit is lower at PIL 3 than PIL 4.

The numbers highlighted in bold in Table 2 represent
hcrit and dn/dh calculated for the main PIL that was
”activated” at the peak of the ﬂare. The main PIL was
chosen as the PIL above which the strongest ﬂare rib-
bons were observed at the ﬂare peak. The results show
that for events one, two, three, and four (E1–E4 in Ta-
ble 2) the critical height above which a ﬂux rope would
become torus unstable, hcrit, is 39, 40, 42 and 48 Mm,
respectively. Above these heights, the decay index falls
with height as 0.020, 0.022, 0.017 and 0.16 Mm−1, re-
spectively. Following the ﬁndings of Kliem et al. (2021) a
correlation between CME velocity and the rate at which
the decay index falls has been indicated for CMEs with
speeds greater than 1500 km s−1, which in this study ap-
plies to the two SEP productive events only (events two
and three). Our results are consistent with the ﬁndings
in Kliem et al. (2021) however, our values indicate that
the region has the possibility of producing a fast CME
((cid:62)1500 km s−1) at the time of all four events. We only
observe fast CMEs during events two and three, which
are SEP-productive.

4.2. Magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in active region

vicinity

To investigate the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in the
vicinity of the AR, potential ﬁeld models are constructed
using the PFFS model available in SSWIDL. The mod-
els are made are constructed on 2017 September 4 at
18:04 UT, 2017 September 6 at 12:04 UT, and 2017
September 7 at 12:04 UT (Figure 6), close to the time of
the four events. The models reveal the presence of a null
point to the north east of the AR, between AR 12673 and
AR 12674, which is located in the northern hemisphere.
The null is present throughout the time period in which
the four events studied here take place. The potential
ﬁeld models also reveal a channel of open magnetic ﬁeld
along the east boundary of the negative polarity, which
is also present for the entire duration of the events and
corresponds to a small coronal hole in the AIA obser-
vations. As can be seen in Figure 6, the conﬁguration
of the null changes in the time period of the four events
between 2017 September 4 and 7. On September 4 the
null is not associated with open ﬁeld lines, while on 6
and 7 the west section of the null is associated with par-
tially and completely open ﬁeld, respectively. The null
is closed on the west side until September 6 due to the
decayed positive magnetic ﬂux that is close to the AR
boundary and also an AR beyond the west limb.

By comparing the EUV and coronagraph data of each
of the four eruptive events to the magnetic ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration given by the potential ﬁeld model the follow-
ing conclusions are drawn. Event one is directed to the
west of the radial and away from the null point and
open magnetic ﬁeld. The emission structures observed
in the AIA data indicate no signiﬁcant perturbation at
the null. Event two, which is directed approximately
radial from the AR, interacts with the null as the mag-

netic ﬁeld expansion of the CME occurs. In event 3 the
AIA EUV data shows that reconnection occurs at the
null point, likely due to the CME propagation direction,
which is east of the AR radial. This is also the location
of open magnetic ﬁeld. Finally, event four propagates
to the south-west of the radial direction away from the
null point and open magnetic ﬁeld.

5. MAGNETIC CONNECTIVITY TO EARTH

For energetic particles to escape and reach Earth they
ultimately need to be injected onto open magnetic ﬁeld
lines that are magnetically connected to Earth. To in-
vestigate the footpoints of open ﬁeld that is magnetically
connected to Earth during 2017 September 4–7 we use a
combination of the potential ﬁeld source surface model
(PFSS, Schatten et al. 1969) along with a ballistic prop-
agation model (Neugebauer et al. 1998).

We use a Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG)
synoptic photospheric magnetic ﬁeld map taken on 2017
September 9 at 23:14 UT to construct the PFSS model.
The GONG map is loaded into Python using SunPy
(SunPy Community et al. 2020) and pfsspy (Yeates
2018; Stansby 2019) was used to construct the potential
ﬁeld between 1 R(cid:12) and 2.5 R(cid:12). Then a Parker spiral
conﬁguration is assumed above 2.5 R(cid:12) using a solar wind
speed of 500 km s−1. This speed was the average solar
wind speed measured by ACE during our time period.
We then use HelioPy (Stansby et al. 2021), along with
SpiceyPy (Annex et al. 2021) and the SPICE toolkit
(Acton et al. 2018) to trace the ﬁeld lines connected to
Earth back to their source on the surface. We do this
for four diﬀerent times (2017 September 4 at 18:00 UT,
2017 September 4 at 20:00 UT, 2017 September 6 at
11:52 UT, and 2017 September 7 at 14:31 UT) at the
start of each eruptive event (see Section 3). We choose
these times so that we can determine the instantaneous
Earth connectivity and estimate the source location of
the energetic particles measured near-Earth.

The radial magnetic ﬁeld shows positive (negative) magnetic polarities that are saturated at ±300 G in white (black). The pink
lines represent magnetic ﬁeld that is open, and the blue lines represent magnetic ﬁeld that belongs to a magnetic null point
located between AR 12673 and AR 12674. On September 4 (panel a) the ﬁeld lines associated with the null are closed whereas,
on September 6 and 7 (panels b and c) the magnetic ﬁeld of the null are partially and completely open on the west side.

Figure 7 shows the magnetic connectivity of Earth at
the times of the four eruptive events. The top panel
shows the Earth’s back-projected trajectory (green line),
the traced ﬁeld lines (black lines), and the location of
the heliospheric current sheet (black line) overlaid on
the GONG synoptic magnetogram. The bottom panel
shows the same but overlaid on a SDO/AIA 193 ˚A syn-
optic map, constructed by joining 27 AIA images to-
gether, with the ﬁnal image taken on 2017 September
10.

The results show that for the ﬁrst two events (on 2017
September 4) the Earth-connected ﬁeld lines are rooted
to the south-east of AR 12673 in decayed negative polar-
ity ﬁeld. We recall that the ﬁrst event (2017 September
4 at 18:05 UT) was non-SEP productive, and the CME
propagated to the south-west. The second event (2017
September 4 at 20:00 UT), which was SEP productive,
propagated radially from AR 12673. However, it was a
wide CME, likely to expand into Earth-connected ﬁeld
lines to the south-east of the source AR.

For events three and four,

the connectivity has
changed, and Earth-connected ﬁeld lines are rooted in
NOAA AR 12674 (to the north-east of 12673). In par-
ticular, the ﬁeld lines are rooted in the main positive
polarity spot of AR 12674. The magnetic ﬁeld from this
part of the AR forms part of the null point that ex-
ists between ARs 12673 and 12674. As we have seen
in Section 3, the erupting loop structures in event three
propagate in many directions, including into the null,
and where AR 12674 is connected to Earth.
In event
four, the eruption propagates to the west away from the
region that is well-connected to Earth.

6. SUMMARY & DISCUSSION

The analysis presented here uses AR 12673 as a case
study to investigate whether and how the magnetic en-
vironment of an AR plays a role in ﬂare/CME events
being (or not being) SEP productive. Several aspects
of the magnetic ﬁeld are considered including how the
strength of the ﬁeld falls with height in the AR, and
whether that correlates with CME speed (important for
generating shocks), how the magnetic ﬁeld of the AR
interacts with its surrounding ﬁeld during the dynamic
phase of the ﬂare/CME, and how particles may get in-
jected onto observer-connected ﬁeld lines. Despite the
four events occurring close in time, there are some inter-
esting diﬀerences and important ﬁndings that are sum-
marised here and in Figure 8.

In event one, which was non-SEP productive, a ma-
jor ﬂare occurred (M1.0 GOES-class), and a relatively
fast CME that had a radial speed of 973 km s−1. At
this time, the Earth-connected ﬁeld lines were rooted in
a region of negative polarity ﬁeld to the south-east of
NOAA AR 12673 (see purple lines in Figure 8 a), not in
the core of the AR, where the ﬂare ribbons indicate mag-
netic connection to locations of particle acceleration due
to ﬂare processes. The CME occurring during this event
was fairly narrow and propagated to the west of AR
12673’s radial direction, i.e. away from earth-connected
ﬁeld lines (black arrow in Figure 8 a). Perhaps deﬂected
by the small coronal hole (CH) to the east of the AR. No
perturbation of the null was observed in EUV imaging
data, in line with the CME propagation direction (i.e.
away from the null), and no CME-driven shock was pro-
duced. The data indicate that ﬂare accelerated particles
were not able be re-directed via magnetic reconnection
onto Earth-connected ﬁeld lines, and no shock accelera-
tion of particles occurred due to the CME propagation.

Event two was SEP productive and involved a ﬂare
and CME that was initiated less than two hours af-
ter event one. Very little evolution of the AR corona
took place during this short interval, in terms of pho-
tospheric motions and ﬂux emergence, and the location
of the Earth-connected ﬁeld lines remained the same at
the Sun as it was for event one (purple lines Figure 8 b).
What was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent were the characteristics
of the CME, which expanded to have an angular width
of ∼200◦, and propagated into an environment already
modiﬁed by the previous CME (event one). This expan-
sion appears to have been suﬃcient to cause the CME
to interact with the Earth connected-ﬁeld lines. The
shock created by this CME likely accelerated particles
along the open ﬁeld lines, meaning the particles were
able to reach Earth. The expansion of the CME also
activated the null between ARs 12673 and 12674 (red
and dashed blue lines in Figure 8 b), leading to recon-
nection. However, this reconnection (and any trans-
fer of particles) did not involve any open ﬁeld lines
that were Earth-connected. Collectively, these obser-
vations are suggestive of particle acceleration occurring
along Earth-connected open ﬁeld to the south-east of
AR 12673, accelerated by the CME shock, consistent
with a post-eruption origin as found by Chertok (2018);
Chertok et al. (2018).

At the time of event three, the location of the Earth-
connnected ﬁeld lines had moved from its previous po-
sition to the south-east of AR 12673 and into the neg-
ative polarity (leading) spot of AR 12674 (purple lines
Figure 8 c). The CME that occurred as part of event
three, propagated to the north-east, radially from the
AR (black arrows in Figure 8 c), and therefore towards
the null. An activation of the null was evidenced in
EUV imaging data and reconnection at the null eﬀec-
tively opened ﬁeld lines in AR 12763 (as it transferred
the footpoints of the open Earth-connected ﬁeld from
AR 12674 to AR 12673), providing a magnetic chan-
nel for ﬂare accelerated particles to escape to Earth. In
addition, the detected type II burst indicates the occur-
rence of a CME-driven shock that also may have accel-
erated particles along Earth-connected ﬁeld lines. It is
interesting to note that the SEP energy spectrum, al-
though still soft, contained higher energy protons (of a
few hundred MeV, see Figure 1 b) than were detected
at Earth during event two (Bruno et al. 2019).

The CME of event four was narrow and was deﬂected
to the south-west, away from Earth connected ﬁeld lines
that remained in NOAA AR 12674 at this time, albeit
modiﬁed by the null-point reconnection of event three
(see Figure 8 d). Although the null point was well devel-
oped at this time, there appears to have been no activa-

tion of the null (i.e. reconnection). The relatively small
and slow CME, deﬂected away from Earth-connected
ﬁeld lines, with no reconnection to transfer particles,
seems to be at the heart of why event four was not SEP-
productive.

The previous work of Chertok et al. (2018) analysed
the CMEs of the two SEP-productive events (i.e. our
events two and three) including the propagation of the
CMEs through the high-speed solar wind stream ema-
nating from the coronal hole to the south-east of AR
12673. Their Figure 1 shows that dimmings associated
with the ﬁeld expansion of the CMEs in these two events
extends to AR 12674. This supports our observational
ﬁndings that reconnection at the null (activation of the
null) occurs in both SEP-productive events, transferring
the footpoints of some of the erupting magnetic ﬁeld
from AR 12673 to AR 12674. However, this reconnec-
tion, and the new magnetic pathways it creates, likely
only becomes signiﬁcant for the second SEP-productive
event (our event three), since only from this time on
are Earth-connected ﬁeld lines rooted in AR 12764. It
could be speculated that the scenarios of CME-shock
accelerated particles along Earth-connected ﬁeld (event
two) and ﬂare-processes, as well as shock accelerated
particles (in event three), could contribute to the dif-
ferent energy spectra observed in situ. In that respect,
protons arriving at Earth from event two are limited
to energies below 150 MeV whereas for event three the
protons reach energies of a few hundred MeV (Bruno
et al. 2019). Indeed, Bruno et al. (2019) ﬁnd that the
temporal evolution of the SEP events are complex but
conclude that both events show evidence of CME-shock
accelerated particles.

When modelling the magnetic ﬁeld of an AR, non-
linear force free ﬁeld models are usually more appro-
priate than potential ﬁeld models as ARs consist of
non-potential ﬁeld conﬁgurations with varying degrees
of shear and twist across the conﬁguration. However, in
this study we are interested in the large-scale magnetic
ﬁeld of the solar corona surrounding the AR where the
magnetic ﬁeld is known to be close-to a potential state
and the decay index proﬁle of the magnetic ﬁeld over-
lying the AR, which only requires knowledge of the po-
tential ﬁeld. To validate the PFSS model for the ﬁeld
surrounding the AR, we used EUV emission structures
observed by SDO/AIA. For example, the ﬁeld associ-
ated with the magnetic null, which is observed to the
north-east of AR 12673, and the small coronal hole to
the east where open magnetic ﬁeld is located.

Very strong magnetic ﬁelds have been recorded in this
AR (Wang et al. 2018) and therefore numerous artifacts
in the line-of-sight and vector magnetic ﬁeld exist (An-

16

Yardley et al.

ﬁnogentov et al. 2019). These artefacts are present along
one of the AR’s PILs and are most apparent in the tran-
verse ﬁeld component. Therefore, our approach of us-
ing the PFSS model, involving the radial magnetic ﬁeld
component as the boundary condition, our investigation
of the magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the AR, and the
gradient of the overlying magnetic ﬁeld with height in-
volve ﬁeld lines with footpoints away from the PILs in
the AR. Therefore, these artefacts do not aﬀect our anal-
ysis of the conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld provided
by the potential ﬁeld extrapolations.

Using a potential ﬁeld model allows the rate at which
the downward Lorentz force of the overlying ﬁeld varies
with height to be determined. Kliem et al. (2021) have
shown that the rate at which this force varies with
height is correlated with CME speed for CMEs with
speeds greater than 1500 km s−1. Both SEP-productive
events in this study have CMEs with speeds greater than
this value, whereas the non SEP-productive events are
slower. Using the same height range as Kliem et al.
(2021) we calculated the change of the decay index with
altitude dn/dh, above the critical height hcrit for all
four events. We obtained the change of the decay index
with altitude above the ﬂare/CME sites (as indicated
by the location of the ﬂare ribbons) in order to deter-
mine whether this metric indicates when an AR might
be capable of producing a fast CME and therefore creat-
ing shock-accelerated particles. Our results show little
variation in dn/dh at the times of the four events, even
though two of the CMEs have speeds below 1500 km s−1.
Event three shows a lower dn/dh than expected as the
region produces a CME that is >2000 km s−1. How-
ever, event three is our most complex event and the ﬂare

seemingly has two parts; conﬁned and eruptive. Flare
ribbons are seen to extend along PIL 3 and then 4 by
the peak of the ﬂare. The critical heights are quite dif-
ferent (42 vs 59 Mm above PILs 3 and 4), for this event
however, the values of dn/dh are very similar (0.017 and
0.016 Mm−1). The complexity of the events produced
by this region brings into question, which PILs should
be used for the calculation of hcrit and dn/dh. Never-
theless, this is a very preliminary study in a complex AR
with several PILs activating during each event and more
analysis is required in order to determine whether the
parameters hcrit and dn/dh could be interesting prox-
ies to consider alongside other characteristics of an AR’s
magnetic ﬁeld when assessing likelihood of SEP occur-
rence.
