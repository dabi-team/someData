ABSTRACT

The unique binary AR Scorpii consists of an asynchronously rotating, magnetized white dwarf (WD)
that interacts with its red-dwarf companion to produce a large-amplitude, highly coherent pulsation
every 1.97 minutes. Over the course of two years, we obtained thirty-nine hours of time-resolved,
optical photometry of AR Sco at a typical cadence of 5 seconds to study this pulsation. We ﬁnd that
it undergoes signiﬁcant changes across the binary orbital period and that its amplitude, phase, and
waveform all vary as a function of orbital phase. We show that these variations can be explained by
constructive and destructive interference between two periodic, double-peaked signals: the spin-orbit
beat pulse, and a weaker WD spin pulse. Modelling of the light curve indicates that in the optical,
the amplitude of the primary spin pulse is 50% of the primary beat amplitude, while the secondary
maxima of the beat and spin pulses have similar amplitudes. Finally, we use our timings of the beat
pulses to conﬁrm the presence of the disputed spin-down of the WD. We measure a beat-frequency
derivative of ˙ν = (−5.14 ± 0.32) × 10−17 Hz s−1 and show that this is attributable to the spin-down
of the WD. This value is approximately twice as large as the estimate from Marsh et al. (2016) but
is nevertheless consistent with the constraints established in Potter & Buckley (2018). Our precise
measurement of the spin-down rate conﬁrms that the decaying rotational energy of the magnetized
white dwarf is suﬃcient to power the excess electromagnetic radiation emitted by the binary.

1. INTRODUCTION

The cataclysmic variable AR Scorpii (AR Sco) shows
large-amplitude, highly periodic pulsations across the
electromagnetic spectrum every 1.97 minutes, superim-
posed upon a strong waveform at the system’s 3.56-h
orbital period (Marsh et al. 2016). The system’s low
X-ray luminosity rules out the presence of signiﬁcant
accretion by the white dwarf (WD) primary from its M-
dwarf companion, so neither of these signals is powered
by accretion (Marsh et al. 2016; Takata et al. 2018). In-
stead, AR Sco has been called a white-dwarf pulsar be-
cause its pulsations consist of synchrotron radiation and

are apparently powered by the spin-down of its highly
magnetized ((cid:46) 500 MG) WD, similar to neutron-star
pulsars (Marsh et al. 2016; Buckley et al. 2017).

The spin-down of the WD is a foundational conclu-
sion from Marsh et al. (2016), who calculated that the
spin-down rate they detected is large enough to power
AR Sco’s pulsations. However, Potter & Buckley (2018)
contested the signiﬁcance of this spin-down after ﬁnding
that the Marsh et al. (2016) spin-down ephemeris did
not accurately predict the frequencies of the spin and
orbital periods in their optical photometry. Although
Potter & Buckley (2018) concluded that a linear spin
ephemeris accurately described their data, they were
also careful to note that their result constrained—but
did not rule out—the WD spin-down. An unambiguous

detection of the slowing spin rate, they wrote, would
require additional observations.

AR Sco’s light curve contains a number of remarkable
features at diﬀerent timescales. The orbital waveform
is brightest at phase ∼0.4 and has a peak-to-peak am-
plitude of ∼1.5-2 mag in the optical, depending on the
bandpass. Katz (2017) proposes two alternative mod-
els to explain the orbital modulation and why it does
not peak at superior conjunction. To provide obser-
vational constraints for these models, Littleﬁeld et al.
(2017) analyzed archival, ground-based photometry as
well as 79 days of continuous photometry by the Kepler
K2 mission. They reported that while the system’s over-
all brightness has remained relatively stable since 2005,
the orbital waveform peaked at a diﬀerent phase and had
a slightly lower amplitude between 2005-2007. More-
over, the K2 photometry showed aperiodic brightness
ﬂuctuations at the level of a few percent on a timescale
of days (Littleﬁeld et al. 2017).

The 1.97-min pulsations are arguably AR Sco’s deﬁn-
ing observational characteristic and are remarkable for
their speed, amplitude (a factor of ∼ 4 in the opti-
cal), and phase coherence across a wide range of wave-
lengths, including radio, near-infrared, optical, ultravi-
olet (Marsh et al. 2016; Stanway et al. 2018) and even
soft X-rays (Takata et al. 2018). Their period corre-
sponds with the beat period (i.e., the orbital sideband)
between the binary orbital period and 1.95-min WD spin
period, and they are thought to originate on the inner
hemisphere of the M5-class companion star (Marsh et al.
2016; Takata et al. 2018). Geng et al. (2016) proposes
that the WD’s magnetic axis is inclined with respect
to its rotational axis and that the pulses are caused by
the interaction of the WD’s magnetosphere with the sec-
ondary’s wind.

The 1.95-min spin period of the white dwarf in AR Sco
is extremely short when compared with the system’s or-
bit. White dwarfs are not born spinning so rapidly, and
it is thought that a phase of high accretion powered
AR Sco’s rapid spin-up, followed by the current epoch
of little or no mass transfer (Marsh et al. 2016; Buckley
et al. 2017).

Here, we present high-cadence photometry with the
twin objectives of (1) searching for a spin-down and (2)
disentangling the spin and beat periods.

2. DATA

2.1. SLKT observations

We obtained 39 hours of high-time-resolution photom-
etry of AR Sco using the 80-cm Sarah L. Krizmanich
Telescope (SLKT) and an unﬁltered Santa Barbara In-
strument Group STL-1001 CCD camera at the Univer-

sity of Notre Dame in 2016, 2017, and 2018. As indi-
cated in Table 1, which lists details of each time series,
the exposure time was 2 s, and factoring in the overhead
between images, the typical cadence was 5-6 s, and each
time series usually spanned 1-3 h. Fig. 1 plots a rep-
resentative, 2.5-hour-long light curve and zooms in on
one segment during which the pulsations were especially
prominent.

The system’s optical pulsations are extremely fast and
well-deﬁned, so CCD data must be well-timed in order
to be useful. Consequently, we synchronized the clock
of the CCD control computer to an atomic clock prior
to the start of each time series. Additionally, we mea-
sured the shutter lag of the detector (the time oﬀset be-
tween the shutter actuation and the timestamp recorded
in the FITS header), found it to be stable from night-
to-night, and applied an appropriate correction to the
image timestamps. Finally, we applied a BJDT DB cor-
rection to all observations using routines in Astropy (As-
tropy Collaboration et al. 2013).

We used aperture photometry to extract AR Sco’s
light curve, but there were no optimal comparison stars
within the ﬁeld of view. According to APASS photom-
etry, each of the ﬁeld stars is quite red, probably be-
cause there is a dark nebula associated with the ρ Ophi-
uchi complex along the line of sight to AR Sco. Faced
with this paucity of choices, we selected UCAC4 336-
082341 (α2000 = 16h 22m 06.481s, δ2000 = −22◦ 53’
27.84”, g(cid:48) − r(cid:48) = 2.17) as our comparison star. Since the
spectral properties of such a reddened star are likely a
poor match for those of AR Sco, any attempt to infer
standard V magnitudes from the unﬁltered photome-
try would probably suﬀer from serious systematic er-
rors. Consequently, we do not place our photometry on
a standard magnitude scale.

2.2. AAVSO observations

As indicated in Table 2, coauthors FJH and GM
observed AR Sco and submitted their observations to
the AAVSO International Database1 under AAVSO ob-
server codes HMB and MGW, respectively. Their ob-
servations had cadences that ranged from 14-35 s.

3. ANALYSIS

Lomb-Scargle power spectra of the SLKT data, pre-
sented in Fig. 2, show that the measured spin and
beat frequencies agree with those reported in Potter
& Buckley (2018). However, the predicted spin and
beat frequencies from the Marsh et al. (2016) spin-down
ephemeris are in poor agreement with the peaks ob-

served in our data, conﬁrming the result in Potter &
Buckley (2018). We explore this issue in depth in Sec. 4.
After eliminating a small number of SLKT observa-
tions with a signal-to-noise ratio of less than 5, we dis-
play our photometry in Fig. 3. The data have been
phased to the orbital period based on the ephemeris in
Marsh et al. (2016). The zero point of the orbital phase
is deﬁned as the moment that the red secondary star is
at inferior conjunction. The overall light curve shape is
similar to the slower cadence data analyzed by Little-
ﬁeld et al. (2017). The light curve is asymmetric, with
a quick rise to maximum brightness at an orbital phase
of 0.4 and a second peak at an orbital phase of ∼0.75.
We assume that the observed light curve can be repre-
sented as the sum of a slowly varying orbital modulation
and the high-frequency, pulsed emission. To remove the
variations associated with the orbit, we divided the or-
bit into phase bins and identiﬁed the faintest 5% of the
points in each bin. Because contamination by the pulsed
emission inﬂates the amplitude of the orbital waveform
in a simple Lomb-Scargle power spectrum, the faintest
observations in these bins more accurately describe the
underlying orbital modulation, and we selected the ex-
act threshold from trial-and-error. We then represented
these points with a Fourier series so that we could pre-

dict the strength of the orbital modulation as a function
of orbital phase. As seen in Fig. 3, the orbital variation
is moderately asymmetric, with the peak brightness just
before phase 0.5 and the minimum at phase 0.0.

Subtracting the orbital-modulation function from the
phased orbital light curve yields the pulsed light curve
as a function of orbital phase (bottom panel in Fig. 3).
The pulse amplitude displays a strong orbital-phase
dependence, peaking at orbital phase ∼0.25, reaching
minimum amplitude near phase ∼0.6, and rebounding
around phase 0.75.

To more closely investigate the changes in the pulse
amplitude and morphology, we split the data into ten
equally-sized, non-overlapping orbital bins and phased
each bin to the beat period. The resulting plots (Fig. 4)
show that the beat pulse has two unequal maxima per
cycle, as has been noted by Marsh et al. (2016). Our
beat phaseplots show that the shape, amplitude, and
phase of both maxima vary as a function of orbital
phase. At orbital phase 0.0, the major pulse is broad
and symmetric, but between orbital phases 0.1-0.3, its
shape changes, with the rise to beat maximum becoming
longer than the decline. This is also the orbital phase
when the major pulse has the largest amplitude. Around
orbital phase 0.35, the major peak is again symmetric

et al. (2016).

but soon skews in the other direction. Eventually, the
major peak nearly disappears around phase 0.55. For
the second half of the orbit, the major pulse remains
symmetrical, but is weaker than in the ﬁrst half of the
orbit. The minor pulse reaches its largest amplitude be-
tween orbital phases 0.3 and 0.4, signiﬁcantly later than
phase 0.25 for the major pulse.

The beat pulse undergoes a signiﬁcant phase shift, de-
pending on the orbital phase. This is most easily seen in
a heatmap of the pulse brightness versus both the orbital
and beat phase (see Fig. 5). This ﬁgure clearly shows
that between orbital phases 0.1 and 0.5, the major peak
shifts by 10% in beat phase. The shift in the beat pulse

phase. After subtracting the orbital modulation, the light
curve was divided into ten orbital phase bins, and each bin
is phased on the beat period. Two beat cycles are shown
in each panel. Two unequal amplitude peaks are seen each
beat cycle suggesting that both poles of the WD magnetic
ﬁeld are interacting with the secondary star. The amplitude
and pulse shape are seen to vary with orbital phase. The
pulse shape is asymmetric during the ﬁrst half of an orbit,
resulting in its centroid shifting in phase by over 10 s over
an orbit.

over the second half of the orbit is smaller than the ﬁrst
half, but the pulse is generally seen to be broader and
fainter. Takata et al. (2018) reported similar ﬁndings
from their analysis of 39 ks of data obtained on 2016
September 19 with the XMM Newton satellite’s Opti-
cal/UV Monitor Telescope, and our results imply that
this behavior is stable on timescales of years.

The amplitude and phase shifts of the beat pulse are
consistent with the addition of second periodic signal
with a slightly diﬀerent frequency (e.g., as observed in
FO Aqr; Osborne & Mukai 1989). For example, if the
spin pulse were to be isolated and plotted in the heat
map in Fig. 5, it would run diagonally since the ﬁgure
phases the data to the beat period. To explore this pos-
sibility, we modeled the full light curve as the superposi-
tion of three periodic signals: the spin, beat, and orbital
periods (similar to the light curve model for FO Aqr in
its low state (Littleﬁeld et al. 2016)). We found the best-
ﬁt trigonometric function at each of those frequencies by
a simple least-squares ﬁt, with each term consisting of
three harmonics. We also attempted to ﬁt additional
frequencies detected in the power spectrum, but adding

al. (2016), and assume an orbital inclination of i = 60◦,
then the semi-amplitude of the light-travel delay would
be 0.6 s.

Although the eﬀect of light-travel delays is relatively
minor at our ∼5-s cadence, a higher time resolution
might potentially be able to discern light-travel delays
from emission from diﬀerent regions of the secondary
(i.e., across a range of values of d and φ0).

Although there might be a light-travel delay associ-
ated with the spin pulse, the region in which the optical
spin pulse is generated is unknown, making it impossible
to calculate its light-travel delay. Buckley et al. (2017)
provide evidence that it might originate in a “striped
wind” outside the light cylinder of the magnetosphere,
which is almost an order of magnitude larger than the
binary orbital separation.

4. SPIN-DOWN EPHEMERIS

4.1. Measuring the spin-down

Marsh et al. (2016) detected a signiﬁcant spin-
˙ν = −(2.86 ± 0.36) × 10−17
frequency derivative of
Hz s−1, implying a spin-down of suﬃcient magnitude to
power the optical pulsations. However, Potter & Buck-
ley (2018) found that the Marsh et al. (2016) spin-down
ephemeris did not accurately predict the frequencies
observed in their power spectra and concluded their
photometry was consistent with a constant spin period
of 0.008538220(3) Hz, where the number in parentheses
is the uncertainty on the ﬁnal digit. While Potter &
Buckley (2018) showed that the spin-down ephemeris
from Marsh et al. (2016) was inaccurate, they noted that
their results could still be reconciled with a nonzero ˙ν
and that a longer baseline of observations was necessary
to investigate this possibility.

Our results in Sec. 3 show that the beat pulse is more
readily measured than the lower-amplitude spin pulse,
so we use O−C measurements of the beat pulse to search
for a change in the spin period. Assuming that any
change in the orbital period is small over the baseline of
observations, the derivative in the beat frequency will be
a direct measure of the derivative of the spin frequency.
We measured 1,077 beat-pulse timings2 from our
dataset by ﬁtting a Gaussian to each well-observed beat
pulse. The timings, which span two years and three
observing seasons, have a suﬃciently long baseline to
search for ˙ν. We applied a correction to all pulse tim-
ings to compensate for the orbital-phase dependence of
their arrival times, using the empirical ﬁt from Fig. 6.

2 These timings are available as an online table, and in Table 3,
we provide a sample of them to illustrate the format of the data.

Figure 6. An O−C diagram of the beat pulses reveals an ob-
vious orbital-phase dependence. The increased scatter in the
residuals near orbital phase 0.5 corresponds with a dropoﬀ in
the amplitude of the beat pulse. Decreased SNR near orbital
phase 0.0 contributes to the noisy timings near that phase.

these terms did not signiﬁcantly improve the quality of
the ﬁt.

The results of this ﬁt (Fig. 7) reveal that the beat
and spin models are both double-peaked, with the beat
pulse having two unequal maxima. The maxima of the
spin pulse, by contrast, are roughly equal. Our model
predicts that the amplitude of the spin pulse is about
50% of the amplitude of the beat pulse, while the mi-
nor pulses are comparable in brightness. However, one
limitation of our model is that it underestimates the
amplitude of the highest-amplitude beat pulses. This
might be a consequence of the fact that the model does
not account for the changing visibility of the secondary’s
inner hemisphere across the orbital period.

As a test of this model, we computed the O−C for the
blended spin-beat pulse, and as shown in Fig. 6, it of-
fers a reasonably accurate prediction of the actual O−C.
The simulated O−C includes a correction for light-travel
delays caused by the secondary’s orbital motion. The
light-travel delay for pulsations originating from mate-
rial orbiting in the plane of the binary is given by

∆t = −

d
c

sin(i) cos(2π[φorb − φ0]),

(1)

where d is the distance of the emission from the binary
center of mass, i is the orbital inclination, c is the speed
of light, and φ0 is orbital phase of inferior conjunction
for the emitting material. Given the requirement that
the emission originate on the donor (Marsh et al. 2016),
the smallest-possible light-travel delay would occur for
emission arising at the ﬁrst Lagrangian point (L1). If we
adopt M1 = 0.8 M(cid:12) and M2 = 0.3 M(cid:12), as did Marsh et

Figure 7. Top: An example of our data covering nearly half a binary orbit (points connected by a gray line). The thick
line shows the light curve model combining a double peaked beat pulse with a double peaked spin pulse. Bottom: The three
components used to build the model are an orbital modulation, the beat pulse, and the spin pulse. The spin and beat components
each have two harmonic terms. The superposition of the spin and beat pulses causes the combined pulse proﬁle to vary across
the orbital period. This simple model accounts for the pulse amplitude and phase variations of over the orbit, but tends to
underestimate the heights of the peaks over the brightest portion of the light curve.

We then tested the Potter & Buckley (2018) linear
ephemeris by computing an O−C diagram, using the
beat period implied by their spin period. To improve
the signal-to-noise ratio, we averaged the O−C residuals
for each night and used the standard error of their mean
as the 1σ uncertainty for each night. The residuals in
this plot (Fig. 8) show a rising trend, suggesting that
the beat period inferred from Potter & Buckley (2018)
is not a good match to our data. Further, there appears
a signiﬁcant curvature in the O − C measurements con-
sistent with the presence of a period derivative.

We employed two independent ﬁtting procedures—
a bootstrap ﬁt and an aﬃne-invariant Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithm (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013)—
to generate linear and quadratic ephemerides for the
pulse maxima. We inspected the residuals from the
linear and quadratic ephemerides (Fig. 9) to determine
which best described the data. While the measurements
for each season systematically evade the linear ﬁt, this
trend vanished with the inclusion of a quadratic term,
and the χ2

4.2. Testing the spin-down with AAVSO photometry

Fig. 9 includes O−C values from beat pulses in
AAVSO photometry, but in order to provide an in-
dependent test of the spin-down ephemeris, these values
were not included in the calculation of Eq. 2. Because
the cadences of these time series were too slow for
O−C analysis of individual beat maxima, we took each
AAVSO light curve and phased it to the beat period
using our linear and quadratic ephemerides. The re-
sulting beat-phase plots, an example of which is shown
in Fig. 10, can be used to measure the average phase
of the beat-pulse maxima provided that enough beat
cycles were observed. We ﬁltered the AAVSO photom-
etry to exclude any time series with a cadence slower
than 35 s or a duration shorter than 1 hr, and we ap-
plied a correction for the orbital-phase dependence of
the pulse arrival times. We further excluded any time
series aﬄicted by aliasing between the beat period and
the observing cadence.

With the beneﬁt of the extended baseline of observa-
tions, it is immediately obvious in Fig. 9 that the linear
ephemeris leads to strong curvature in the residuals. By

Figure 9. A comparison of the residuals from the best-ﬁt
linear and quadratic ephemerides to beat-pulse timings from
the SLKT (red markers) and AAVSO data (blue markers).
Only the SLKT data were used to generate the ephemerides;
the AAVSO data are shown as an independent test of both
ﬁts. Each SLKT point gives the mean and standard error
of the residuals from one observing run. As described in the
text, a constant oﬀset of 0.7 sec was added to each AAVSO
measurement to compensate for uncorrected shutter lag.

contrast, the quadratic residuals do not show any sys-
tematic trend.

No shutter-lag correction was applied to the AAVSO
data, and the raw AAVSO quadratic residuals showed an
oﬀset of -0.7 s with respect to contemporaneous SLKT
residuals. An uncorrected shutter lag will cause times-
tamps to be earlier than the data that they describe,
imparting a small, negative O−C to the pulse timings.
We therefore attribute the constant, negative oﬀset of
the AAVSO residuals to uncorrected shutter lag, and
in Fig. 9, we add an oﬀset of 0.7 s to each AAVSO
residual to compensate for this eﬀect. Regardless of the
cause of this oﬀset, the lack of a systematic trend in the
AAVSO quadratic residuals supports our measurement
of the spin-down.

4.3. The nature of ˙νbeat

Because the beat frequency is deﬁned as νbeat =
νspin − νorb, its time derivative is ˙νbeat = ˙νspin − ˙νorb,
meaning that the observed ˙νbeat could be caused either
by a decrease of the spin frequency or an increase in

Figure 11. PDM analysis showing the eﬀect of an increase
in the orbital frequency across 13 years of CRTS and ASAS-
SN photometry (thick black line). For each value of ˙νorb, we
calculated a quadratic orbital ephemeris, computed the PDM
statistic of the resulting phase plot, and normalized it to the
PDM statistic of the linear-ephemeris phase plot. A value
greater than 1 (dotted horizontal line) indicates that adding
˙νorb increases the scatter in the phase plot, while values less
than 1 indicate that ˙νorb reduces the scatter. The colored
lines show the results of simulations in which an artiﬁcial
˙νorb was injected into a model of the orbital light curve. For
˙νorb ≥ 2 × 10−18 Hz s−1, our technique successfully recovers
the simulated ˙νorb at the global minimum of a given curve.
We therefore conclude that ˙νorb <∼ 2 × 10−18 Hz s−1 and is
too small to account for the observed ˙νbeat (dashed vertical
line).

For each quadratic phase plot, we computed the PDM
statistic and normalized it to the the PDM statistic for
the phase plot constructed with the linear ephemeris
from Marsh et al. (2016). The results of this analy-
sis are shown in Fig. 11. For ˙νorb > 2 × 10−18 Hz
s−1, the phase plots contain an obvious increased scatter
with respect to the linear ephemeris; below that value,
˙νorb becomes negligible, so we constrain
the eﬀect of
˙νorb <∼ 2 × 10−18 Hz s−1. To verify this constraint,
we created a simulated orbital light curve of AR Sco,
injected an artiﬁcial
˙νorb, and matched the sampling
of the simulated data to the actual observations. As
Fig. 11 shows, our algorithm successfully recovered val-

correctly—that the orbital period did not change appreciably in
the intervening 5 years since the CRTS epoch. Phase plots using
the CRTS epoch will have a uniform horizontal oﬀset with respect
to the Marsh et al. (2016) epoch, but this does not impact our
PDM analysis.

the orbital frequency. If the orbital period were chang-
ing so rapidly, there would be detectable consequences
in long-term photometry. To explore this possibility, we
used phase-dispersion minimization (PDM; Stellingwerf
1978) to determine whether an increasing orbital fre-
quency could reduce the scatter in orbital phase plots
using 13 years of survey photometry from the Catalina
Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS; Drake et al. 2009)
and All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-
SN; Shappee et al. 2014; Kochanek et al. 2017). For a
range of ˙νorb between 1× 10−19 Hz s−1 and 1 × 10−16 Hz
s−1, we phased the survey photometry using a quadratic
orbital ephemeris in which we assumed an initial or-
bital period of P0 = 0.14853528 d (Marsh et al. 2016) at
an epoch of JD = 2455000.5 (Potter & Buckley 2018).3

et al. (2016) to measure the orbital period.

beat-cycle count, overlaying the beat periods from both
Marsh et al. (2016) and Potter & Buckley (2018) at the
appropriate epochs.4 Even though our beat ephemeris
was calculated without regard to either of these two
measurements, the projected beat period is in excel-
lent agreement with both measurements. Furthermore,
the diﬀerence between the Potter & Buckley (2018) and
Marsh et al. (2016) spin frequencies, when divided by
the diﬀerence in epochs yields ˙ν = −(5.9 ± 1.5) × 10−17
Hz s−1, consistent with both our measurement ( ˙ν =
−5.14(32)×10−17 Hz s−1) and the constraints from Pot-
ter & Buckley (2018).

This suggests that the inability of the Marsh et al.
(2016) ephemeris to correctly predict the spin and beat
frequencies in Potter & Buckley (2018) is a consequence
of an underestimated ˙ν and can be remedied by using
our measurement of the spin-down. Despite the error
in their estimate of ˙ν, it is remarkable, given the sparse
sampling and comparatively low time resolution of the
survey photometry available to them, that they were
able to accurately measure νorb, νbeat, and νspin while
also estimating ˙ν to within a factor of 2.

4.5. Spin-down luminosity

Our precise measurement of the frequency decay rate
allows us to improve the estimate of the spin power
available for conversion into the observed electromag-
netic (EM) energy. The spin-down luminosity, is given
by L ˙ν = −4π2Iνspin ˙ν, where I is the WD’s moment of
inertia (Marsh et al. 2016). As did Marsh et al. (2016),
we assume a 0.8 M(cid:12) WD with a radius of 0.01 R(cid:12).
The mass-radius relation for non-relativistic WD stars
means that the moment of inertia changes as I ∝ M 1/3,
and is rather insensitive to variations in the assumed
mass. In the non-relativistic regime, WDs are predicted
to have a density structure like that of a polytrope with
an index of 1.5, and we calculate a moment of inertia of
I = 0.25M R2 = 2 × 1043 kg m2. However, the strong
magnetic ﬁelds and the rapid spin rate of the WD may
have an eﬀect on the precise value of the moment of
inertia (Franzon & Schramm 2017).

Thus, we ﬁnd the spin-down power is 3 × 1026 W.
The Gaia DR2 parallax (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016,
2018) to AR Sco (8.492 ± 0.041 mas) is equivalent to
a distance of 117.8 ± 0.6 pc, which is close enough to
the Marsh et al. (2016) value that it is unnecessary to
correct their measurement of the average EM power of
the pulsations. We ﬁnd the eﬃciency of converting the
spin energy to detected EM emission to be ∼4%.

4 Potter & Buckley (2018) reported only νspin, so we used νorb

from Marsh et al. (2016) to calculate the corresponding νbeat.

Figure 12. Projected beat period using Eq. 2. The two
markers indicate the beat periods reported by Marsh et al.
(2016) and Potter & Buckley (2018). Since Potter & Buckley
(2018) did not explicitly provide a beat period, we calculated
it from their spin period and the Marsh et al. (2016) orbital
period. As indicated in the legend, Marsh et al. (2016) re-
ported a 90% conﬁdence interval for their result, while Potter
& Buckley (2018) provided a 1σ interval. Even though these
two points were not considered in the ﬁtting procedure for
Eq. 2, the projected beat period is in excellent agreement
with both measurements, substantiating our measurement
of the WD’s spin-down.

that threshold, it could not discern the simulated ˙νorb,
bolstering our constraint.

The non-detection of ˙νorb is consistent with the mea-
surements of the orbital phase of maximum light from
Littleﬁeld et al. (2017). An increasing orbital frequency
˙Porb < 0) would induce concave-down curvature in
(i.e.,
their Fig. 4, but this is not seen. We conclude, therefore,
that any ˙νorb contributes negligibly to ˙νbeat, such that
˙νbeat = ˙νspin to within our measurement uncertainty.
Thus, the subscript notation becomes unnecessary for
˙ν.

Because we have established that ˙ν is the same for the
spin and beat frequencies, we can directly compare our
measurement of ˙ν with its counterpart from Marsh et
al. (2016). Our estimate is larger by a factor of ∼1.8,
but it still satisﬁes the constraint from Potter & Buckley
(2018) that ∼ −2 × 10−16 Hz s−1 < ˙ν <∼ 1 × 10−16 Hz
s−1.

4.4. Reconciling Marsh et al. (2016) with Potter &

Buckley (2018)

The disagreement between the Marsh et al. (2016)
spin-down ephemeris and the measured spin frequency
in Potter & Buckley (2018) provides a stringent test
of our spin-down ephemeris.
In Fig. 12, we plot the
extrapolated beat period from Eq. 2 as a function of

5. CONCLUSION

The complex morphological variations seen in the op-
tical light curve of AR Sco are explained as the super-
position of the spin and beat pulses, as well as a slower
orbital modulation. As noted in earlier studies, a beat
cycle consists of a major and minor pulse. Here, we show
the minor pulse has half the amplitude of the brighter
signal after removing contamination from the spin pulse.
We ﬁnd the spin cycle also consists of two distinct pulses,
but their amplitudes are comparable. The major spin
pulse is half the amplitude of the major beat pulse and
therefore, about the same amplitude as the minor beat
pulse.

Over an orbit, the major beat and spin pulses add con-
structively between phases 0.2 and 0.3, resulting in the
highest-amplitude optical variations observed in the sys-
tem. Half an orbit later, the major beat and minor spin
pulses add together along with the minor beat and major
spin pulses. This combination results in lower amplitude
peaks when compared with orbital phases around 0.25.
The smallest amplitudes are seen when the beat and
spin pulses are out of phase and destructively interfere
around orbital phases between 0.5 and 0.6. This model
provides a good overall ﬁt to the rapid variations seen
in AR Sco. We also show that this model explains the
O−C variations seen in the timings of the beat pulses.
Our simple model assumes constant beat and spin am-
plitudes over an orbit, and this does not fully match the
largest amplitudes ﬂuctuations observed around orbital
phases 0.2 to 0.4. A more complete model would take
into account the changing viewing angle of the secondary
star thought to be the origin of the beat emission.

The major beat and spin pulses coincide at orbital
phase 0.3, resulting in the highest amplitude peaks in
the AR Sco light curve. The beat pulse likely comes
from near the surface of the red secondary star (Marsh
et al. 2016), while the spin pulse is likely originating in
the magnetic ﬁeld of the WD. If we assume that beat
maxima occur when one of the WD magnetic poles is

pointing toward the secondary, then the geometry of the
system suggests that we see the peak spin pulse when
the WD magnetic pole is nearly perpendicular to our
line-of-sight.

Perhaps most importantly, our results establish that
the WD is indeed spinning down (as originally proposed
by Marsh et al. 2016), but the frequency derivative that
we measure is almost twice as large as their estimate.
Our updated spin-down ephemeris successfully passes
it accurately predicts the evolution of the
two tests:
beat period between the Marsh et al. (2016) and Pot-
ter & Buckley (2018) epochs, and it also accounts for
the pulse-arrival times in AAVSO photometry. Further-
more, it comports with the constraints on the spin-down
rate established in Potter & Buckley (2018). Our mea-
surement of the spin-down of the WD conﬁrms the con-
clusion by Marsh et al. (2016) that the pulsed EM emis-
sion from AR Sco can be powered by the rotational en-
ergy of the WD.

formation in our paper.

We are grateful to our anonymous referee for urging us
to measure the spin-down rate of the white dwarf using
the SLKT data.
