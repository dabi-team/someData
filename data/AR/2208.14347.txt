ABSTRACT

×

We studied an X1.6 solar ﬂare produced by AR 12602 on 2014 October 22. The entirety of this event
was covered by RHESSI, IRIS, and Hinode/EIS, allowing analysis of the chromospheric response to
a nonthermal electron driver. We derived the energy contained in nonthermal electrons via RHESSI
spectral ﬁtting, and linked the time-dependent parameters of this call to the response in Doppler
velocity, density, and nonthermal width across a broad temperature range. The total energy injected
1030 erg, and lasted 352 seconds. This energy drove explosive chromospheric evaporation,
was 4.8
with a delineation in both Doppler and nonthermal velocities at the ﬂow reversal temperature, between
1.35–1.82 MK. The time of peak electron injection (14:06 UT) corresponded to the time of highest
velocities. At this time, we found 200 km s−1 blueshifts in the core of Fe XXIV, which is typically
assumed to be at rest. Shortly before this time, the nonthermal electron population had the shallowest
spectral index (
6), corresponding to the peak nonthermal velocity in Si IV and Fe XXI. Nonthermal
velocities in Fe XIV, formed near the ﬂow reversal temperature were low, and not correlated with
density or Doppler velocity. Nonthermal velocities in ions with similar temperatures were observed to
increase and correlate with Doppler velocities, implying unresolved ﬂows surrounding the ﬂow reversal
point. This study provides a comprehensive, time-resolved set of chromospheric diagnostics for a large
X-class ﬂare, along with a time-resolved energy injection proﬁle, ideal for further modeling studies.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares are considered a consequence of magnetic
reconnection in the corona, resulting in the release of
1032 erg over the course of the event. Approximately
≤
20% of the released energy is partitioned into the accel-
eration of particles in the corona (Emslie et al. 2012). A
population of electrons is accelerated near the reconnec-
tion site to relativistic speeds, and stream down coronal
loops away from the acceleration region (Emslie et al.
2004, 2012; Aschwanden et al. 2014). The steep density
increase in the transition region down to the chromo-
sphere is generally responsible for the sudden decelera-
tion of these accelerated particles. Energy is dissipated
in the chromosphere primarily via Coulomb collisions,
with a smaller amount of energy being dissipated via
the bremsstrahlung process, which produces hard X-ray
(HXR) emission via interaction with the “thick-target”
chromosphere (Brown 1971; Lin & Hudson 1976). This

energy injection in the chromosphere is likely the driv-
ing mechanism behind chromospheric evaporation, the
process by which ﬂares produce high-temperature, high-
density plasma in the corona.

The duration and evolution of HXR radiation varies
dramatically from ﬂare to ﬂare. Warmuth & Mann
(2016) studied ﬂares of several GOES classiﬁcations,
and found that the time ranges of signiﬁcant nonther-
mal ﬂux ranged from 0.4 minutes to over 50 minutes
for longer events, but the analysis lacked information
regarding the temporal evolution of the driving electron
beam. Several studies attempted to resolve the time-
dependence of the electron beam (Kulinov´a et al. 2011;
Kennedy et al. 2015; Fletcher et al. 2013), and found the
observed durations of the electron injection events to be
on the order of several minutes. Holman et al. (2003)
analyzed data from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy
Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI ; Lin et al. 2002)
of the X3.6 ﬂare on 2002 July 23 and found nonthermal
HXR emission lasting

10 minutes.

that which can be shed as radiation or conductive

losses, the chromospheric plasma must heat and ex-
pand upward, into the lower-density corona. This pro-
cess ﬁlls overlying magnetic structures of lower density
with high-temperature plasma, which strongly emits ex-
treme ultra-violet (EUV) and soft X-ray (SXR) emis-
sion. This chromospheric evaporation (Neupert 1968;
Bornmann 1999; Fletcher et al. 2011) can occur explo-
sively, with high-temperature lines exhibiting blueshifts,
while cooler emission lines exhibit redshifts (Doschek
1983; Brosius & Phillips 2004; Milligan & Dennis 2009);
or gently, with blueshifted emission lines across a wide
temperature range (Fisher et al. 1985; Brosius & Phillips
2004; Allred et al. 2005; Milligan et al. 2006; Brosius &
Daw 2015). The mode of evaporation is dependant ﬁrst
on the mechanism of ﬂare energy transport. In the case
of energy transport by a nonthermal electron driver, the
mode of evaporation is further dependant on the energy
ﬂux, low energy cutoﬀ, and population distribution of
accelerated electrons reaching the chromospheric foot-
points.

≥

Canﬁeld & Gayley (1987) and Fisher et al. (1985) ﬁrst
deduced this eﬀect and placed a lower limit on the requi-
site energy ﬂux density required to drive explosive evap-
1010 erg cm−2 s−1. If the incoming
oration of Ee−
electron ﬂux is above this threshold, determined by bal-
ancing the heating rate and the hydrodynamic expan-
sion timescale, the over-pressure of the hot rising mate-
rial causes the denser layers below to recoil, resulting in
the cool, redshifted emission characteristic to explosive
evaporation.

×

Thermal conduction-driven chromospheric evapora-
tion, in contrast, does not appear to be subject to above
restrictions on ﬂux deposition. Longcope (2014) found
that even the smallest energy ﬂuxes studied produced
explosive chromospheric evaporation. This result was
also noted in earlier models from Fisher (1989).

In addition to the Doppler velocity signatures of chro-
mosperic evaporation, excess nonthermal width in opti-
cally thin spectral lines has been observed in ﬂare con-
ditions. One possible explanation is the superposition

of unresolved ﬂows. In this case, the nonthermal width
is a measure of the velocity distribution of the plasma
(Doschek et al. 2008). Newton et al. (1995) attempted
to generalize both excess line widths and blue wing en-
hancements by the computation of a Velocity Diﬀeren-
tial Emission Measure (VDEM), which treats the ob-
served line proﬁle as a continuum of Gaussian compo-
nents driven by variations in the line-of-sight velocity.
This treatment is supported by reported correlations
between Doppler velocities and nonthermal velocities
within solar active regions (Hara et al. 2008; Doschek
et al. 2008; Bryans et al. 2010; Peter 2010). Another
possible explanation for excess line widths is the inﬂu-
ence of pressure or opacity broadening in regions of en-
hanced electron density. Milligan (2011) showed a corre-
lation between electron density and nonthermal velocity
broadening, although neither pressure broadening nor
opacity eﬀects were able to account for any signiﬁcant
portion of the excess width.

The ﬂare-driven mass ﬂow rate into the solar corona
remains one of the more diﬃcult solar ﬂare metrics to
disentangle from observations, requiring both accurate
velocity information, and a measure of plasma mass. As
a proxy, the electron density of the active region can be
used (Milligan et al. 2005; Doschek et al. 2008). Density
enhancements have been observed to be cospatial with
the locations of ﬂare footpoints (Graham et al. 2011).
Densities, when combined with the emission measure

(Del Zanna et al. 2011), may also provide information
about the dynamics of the evaporating region. The pre-
viously mentioned VDEM (Newton et al. 1995) is de-
rived in part from the electron density, and provides
direct insight into plasma transport during a solar ﬂare.
The ﬂare chosen for the subject of this study, an X-
class ﬂare on 22 October, 2014, is a well studied event.
Bamba et al. (2017) studied the precursor conditions to
this event in order to determine triggering conditions
in the chromosphere and photospheric magnetic ﬁeld.
Veronig & Polanec (2015) attempted to quantify the
magnetic reconnection ﬂux and rate. Li et al. (2015)
utilized data from the Interface Region Imaging Spec-
trometer (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al. 2014) and RHESSI
instruments to study Doppler velocities in Fe XXI and
C I, and HXR intensities. Thalmann et al. (2015) fo-
cused on the rate of magnetic reconnection. Lee et al.
(2017) measured electron ﬂux at each HXR peak using
RHESSI, and linked the electron energy budget with ob-
served low chromospheric and photospheric energetic re-
sponse. These studies showed that energy was injected
via high-energy electrons, which was suﬃcient to pro-
duce white-light emission.

In this study, detailed, time-resolved RHESSI HXR
spectral ﬁt parameters are presented in order to quantify
the nonthermal electron energy injection proﬁle. The
proﬁle of electron energy injection is then connected to
multispectral observations of the chromospheric evapo-

ration response. Emission line intensities, electron den-
sities, and Doppler and nonthermal velocities from sev-
eral instrumental sources were combined in order to
study the response of the ﬂaring solar atmosphere across
time, space, and temperature. Due to the abundance of
data available for this ﬂare, this data set is ideally-suited
to constrain detailed hydrodynamic modeling of energy
transport during this event.

An overview of this event, the data, and analysis tech-
niques is presented in Section 2. The results of this treat-
ment and comparison to similar studies are discussed in
Section 3, and are summarized in Section 4.

2. DATA ANALYSIS

The X1.6 ﬂare selected for study occurred on 2014 Oc-
tober 22, beginning at 14:02:00 UT, and was one of the
largest ﬂares produced by ﬂare-productive NOAA AR
12192. In Figure 1 the active region is presented in the
1600˚A and 171˚A passbands of the Solar Dynamics Ob-
servatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA;
Lemen et al. 2012), with the ﬁelds of view of the EUV
Imaging Spectrometer (EIS ; Culhane et al. 2007) and
IRIS instruments overlaid, and with HXR contours from
RHESSI imaging overlaid to highlight the primary foot-
points of the ﬂare. Two HXR sources are well-deﬁned
and are cospatial with intensity enhancements in AIA
images. A third, compact HXR kernel appears to the
southwest of the primary ﬂare loop, corresponding to
a possible tertiary footpoint, or merely an extension of
the large western footpoint. Figure 2 shows the RHESSI
HXR lightcurves in three energy bands (25–50, 50–100,
and 100–300 keV) as well as SXR emission from the
GOES 1-8˚A band. Figure 2 provides additional context,
with the time intervals where EIS, IRIS and RHESSI
spectral ﬁts were performed.

The GOES ﬂux for this event plateaus through much
of the event, with a SXR peak found well after the peak
of HXR emission (14:28 UT, versus 14:06 UT). Here-
after, when the peak of the ﬂare is referred to, it is in
reference to the peak of HXR emission.

2.1. RHESSI Analysis

The full duration of this ﬂare was well-covered by
the RHESSI instrument. RHESSI entered its daylight
phase just prior to the onset of the ﬂare, and exited dur-
ing the gradual phase, after the RHESSI HXR peak and
the GOES SXR peak. As of August 2014, the RHESSI
spacecraft had undergone its fourth successful anneal,
allowing ﬁve of the original nine detectors to regain high
spectral resolution.

RHESSI spectra from 14:04:40 – 14:16:56 UT were
obtained with 16 second time bins for detectors 1, 3, 6,

16-second interval with the highest integrated count level

8, and 9, which had consistently high count rates during
the ﬂare, signifying that they retained suﬃcient sensitiv-
ity to be usable. From the peak counts, detector 6 was
determined to be the most sensitive, while detector 1
was the least, leading to diﬀerent ﬁt results and higher
values of χ2 for detector 1. Background characteriza-
tion and spectral ﬁtting were performed for each indi-
vidual detector using the OSPEX package in SolarSoft-
Ware (SSW). For each detector, the background proﬁle
was determined by using the smoothed emission proﬁle
of the 100–300 keV energy band in the same detector.
Save for one brief (< 32s) spike during the impulsive
phase of the ﬂare, emission in this energy range showed
only a slow variation throughout the RHESSI orbital
cycle. This time-varying proﬁle was used as a template
for the background in lower energy bands. The count

Call & Response

rate during RHESSI ’s night was used to determine the
relative scaling between energy bands, and served as an-
chor points for application of the template.

Spectra were ﬁt using a methodology similar to that
adopted by Milligan et al. (2014). The thermal portion
of the RHESSI spectrum was best ﬁt by a multither-
mal model, similar to studies by Aschwanden (2007),
Battaglia et al. (2015), and Choithani et al. (2018).
The multithermal model selected was characterized by
a power-law diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) be-
tween a ﬁxed minimum plasma temperature (0.5 keV)
and a variable maximum plasma temperature. The non-
thermal portion of the RHESSI spectrum was best ﬁt
by a thick-target electron beam model, with an elec-
tron distribution characterized by a single power-law.
Additional instrumental eﬀects were accounted for by
modifying the detector response matrix (drm_mod), ac-
counting for instrumental pileup (pileup_mod), albedo,
and incorporating an additional Gaussian component to
account for the 10 keV instrumental line (Phillips et al.
2006).

Sample spectra are shown in Figure 3 along with the
combined ﬁt functions used to characterize the HXR
proﬁle for a time interval with a signiﬁcant nonther-
mal component (top panel) and a time interval without
(bottom panel). Note that while spectra in Figure 3
are shown in units of photons s−1 cm−2 keV−1, spec-
tral ﬁtting was carried out in count space. The use of
the calculated photon spectrum exaggerates several no-
table features, such as the 10 keV instrumental line ﬁrst
characterized by Phillips et al. (2006). Summaries of
major parameters obtained via RHESSI spectral ﬁtting
are discussed in Section 3.1.

We also make use of the unique imaging capabilities
of RHESSI in order to identify the ﬂare footpoints. The
CLEAN algorithm was applied to detectors 1, 3, 6, 8, and
9 during the impulsive and peak phases of the ﬂare to
identify sources of HXR emission throughout the ﬂare
duration. Contours of these images are overlaid on the
center and right–hand columns of Figure 1 to provide
context for other observations and constrain the loca-
tions of HXR emission during the peak of the ﬂare.

2.2. EIS Analysis
Using the 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slit, the EIS instrument performed
rasters of NOAA AR 12192, capturing the pre-ﬂare, im-
pulsive, peak, and gradual phases of the solar ﬂare cen-
tered around the eastern ﬂare footpoint, as identiﬁed
by RHESSI HXR imaging. The rasters had a cadence
of 214 seconds, covering a ﬁeld of view (FOV) approxi-
mately 60(cid:48)(cid:48)
152(cid:48)(cid:48), as shown in Figure 1. The spatial
resolution of the EIS instrument is 3(cid:48)(cid:48) in the horizontal,

During this event, the footpoint was captured in several
emission lines in the raster FOV; the observed emission
lines are detailed in Table 1, which also includes in-
formation on emission lines from the IRIS instrument.
Gaussian ﬁts were performed for a set of twelve emis-
sion lines from nine diﬀerent ions. While most of the
ions studied required only single-component ﬁts, multi-
ple component ﬁts were performed in order to examine
the eﬀects of blended lines. The He II 256.35˚A, Fe XIV
272.20˚A, Fe XV 284.18˚A, and Ca XVII 192.83˚A lines
required two or more Gaussian proﬁles to account for
known line blends (Young et al. 2007). Even in these
spectral windows, the presence of strong blended lines
was not consistent over each raster, or at each time. Ad-
ditionally, the Fe XXIII 263.78˚A, Fe XXIV 255.13˚A, and
Fe XXIV 192.02˚A lines required multiple components to
account for both blends and a blue-wing enhancement
(Milligan & Dennis 2009).

The spectral ﬁts were used to determine Doppler ve-
locities, nonthermal velocities, electron densities, and
intensities as functions of both temperature and time.
Example ﬁts from a selection of emission lines are shown
in Figure 4. The proﬁles chosen showcase a wide temper-
ature range, from a location within the eastern footpoint
early in the ﬂare, and during the HXR peak.

windows containing He II 256.35˚A, Fe XII 195.12˚A, Fe XVI 262.98˚A, Fe XXIV 192.02˚A, and Fe XII 192.39˚A are shown left to
right. The faint blend with Fe XII 195.12˚A is not shown, as the major line dominates the window. For the IRIS instrument,
spectral windows containing the C II 1334.54˚A and 1335.71˚A doublet, the Si IV 1402.81˚A line, and the Fe XXI 1354.07˚A line are
shown left to right. In each panel, the vertical line(s) denotes the calculated rest wavelength, while the pink dashed proﬁle shows
the proﬁle of a line with the same peak and oﬀset, but only thermal and instrumental width, without nonthermal broadening
(Equation 1).

The rest wavelength for every emission line, save
Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV, was determined from the mean
central wavelength across the less-active raster regions.
In the case of Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV, no plasma can be
assumed to be at rest, and an alternate method was
required. For Fe XXIV 192.02˚A the Fe XII 192.39˚A
line was used to constrain the rest wavelength from the
theoretical separation of the two lines from the CHI-
ANTI database (Dere et al. 1997; Dere et al. 2019). For

Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV 255.13˚A lines, the mean central
wavelength from the 14:31:12 UT raster was used, as
this raster consists entirely of emission produced after
the nonthermal electron injection event.

For

ions with strong blue wing enhancements
(Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV), the Doppler velocities pre-
sented for the blue wing were calculated with the same
reference wavelength used for the line core.

the correlation between velocity parameters and elec-
tron density are discussed in Section 3.2.3.

2.3. IRIS Analysis

In this study, both the spectral and slit-jaw imaging
data from the IRIS instrument were used. For the entire
duration of this event, the IRIS instrument performed a
repeated fast raster scan (131.1 s cadence per complete
raster) of AR 12192, with a 45◦ roll angle. Each spec-
tral raster contained eight slit positions, with a spacing
of 2(cid:48)(cid:48) and 16.32 seconds between positions. The spatial
resolution for each raster was 0.33(cid:48)(cid:48) along the slit, with
a slit width of 0.33(cid:48)(cid:48). No onboard spatial summing was
carried out for these observations. The spectral resolu-
tion was 25.96 m˚A in the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectral
window.

The IRIS slit-jaw camera was used to determine the
area of each ﬂare footpoint. While this is not a di-
rect measurement of the HXR source size, RHESSI
CLEAN imaging tends to signiﬁcantly overestimate the
source size (Dennis & Pernak 2009; Milligan & Den-
nis 2009), and AIA chromospheric images for this event
were severely saturated during the period of interest.

Ribbon areas were determined from IRIS slit-jaw im-
ages using the 10% and 50% levels of each frame max-
imum. This time-dependant area measurement was in-
terpolated from a 32-second cadence to a 16-second ca-
dence, and rebinned to match the RHESSI spectral
time bins. The IRIS slit-jaw camera experienced min-
imal saturation in two exposures during the peak of
the ﬂare; these were omitted from the ﬁnal calculation
of the footpoint area. The time-dependant areas were
used to determine the injected electron energy ﬂux in
erg s−1 cm−2.

IRIS spectra were available for several ion species
during this ﬂare, from which the C II line doublets at
1334.54 and 1335.71˚A, the Si IV 1402.81˚A line, and the
hot Fe XXI line at 1354.07˚A were selected for study.
Using the standard method described by W¨ulser et al.
(2018), radiometric and instrumental calibrations were
performed. The calibrated spectra were ﬁt with multi-
ple component Gaussian proﬁles, accounting for blends
where applicable (Graham & Cauzzi 2015; Young et al.
2015), and allowing for additional blue- and red-wing
components to account for asymmetry in the complex
C II and Si IV emission lines.

Despite the increased emissivity of the faint Fe XXI
line during the ﬂare, it becomes more diﬃcult to ac-
curately ﬁt during the peak of nonthermal electron in-
jection. This is primarily due to the IRIS instrument
automatic exposure compensation, which scales expo-
sures in order to avoid saturation in the more emissive

eral other studies (Doschek et al. 2007; Harra et al. 2009;

ionization equilibrium.

The EIS dataset used in this work contains the
density-sensitive line pair of Fe XIV 264.81/274.23˚A.
The theoretical relationship between the intensity ratio
and electron density for this line pair is shown in Fig-
ure 5, from the CHIANTI v10.0 database (Dere et al.
1997; Dere et al. 2019). This line pair is sensitive to
densities between 108 < ne < 1012 cm−3. It is impor-
tant to note that the relationship between the Fe XIV
intensity ratio and electron density is formed under the
assumption of ionization equilibrium, which may not be
valid during large dynamic events such as solar ﬂares.

ion species. During the peak of the ﬂare, this has the
unfortunate side eﬀect of obscuring weak lines, such as
Fe XXI, within the noise of the continuum.
In an at-
tempt to maximize the signal from the Fe XXI 1354.07˚A
line, data from this spectral window were binned by a
factor of four along the slit.

Of the three species studied, only the Fe XXI emission
line is known to be optically thin. However, simulations
have shown that Doppler shifts of the optically-thick
C II lines are well-correlated with the plasma velocity
(Rathore & Carlsson 2015; Rathore et al. 2015; Rathore
et al. 2015). The Si IV line is sometimes optically thin
(Kerr et al. 2019; Cai et al. 2019; Peter et al. 2014), with
complex wavelength and structure-dependant behaviour
(Zhou et al. 2022). Unfortunately, the diagnostic line at
1393˚A was not observed, and the opacity of the line
could not be determined. Nevertheless, Doppler shifts
were present within the line core, as were widths in ex-
cess of the thermal proﬁle that could not be accounted
for by known blends or observed asymmetry. While the
calculation of nonthermal velocity given by Equation 2.2
is valid only for optically thin proﬁles, the same quantity
calculated for an optically thick proﬁle is a useful mea-
sure of line width. In the case of an optically thick line,
variations in the width of the line are linked to changes
in the optical depth of the line. As with the EIS mea-
surements, the quiescent regions in Si IV and C II rasters
were used to calculate reference rest wavelengths. For
the broad Fe XXI line, quiescent region emission of the
nearby O I line is used to infer the rest wavelength.

3. RESULTS

3.1. RHESSI Results

≈

RHESSI spectral ﬁts were used to derive a set of ther-
mal and nonthermal parameters for the X1.6-class ﬂare
on 2014 October 22. The thermal X-ray parameters,
derived from the multithermal model are presented in
Figure 6. The top panel shows that the reference DEM
(calculated at 2 keV,
23.2 MK) rose sharply soon after
the onset of electron injection, and remained at approx-
1049 cm−3 keV−1), well after
imately the same level (
the cessation of the injection event. The upper limit
on temperature, found in the second panel of the same
ﬁgure, reached a peak of 70 MK early in the ﬂare, and
continued to decline for the rest of the studied interval.
It is important, however, to note that this is the maxi-
mum temperature of the plasma, as characterized by a
power-law DEM, and is not characteristic of the mean
plasma temperature. The power-law index of the DEM
increased slowly throughout the ﬂare, as the bulk of the
plasma cooled.

≈

The nonthermal electron parameters are presented
in Figure 7. The nonthermal electron population is
best characterized by a single-power law distribution
of electrons, that lasted for 352 seconds, and deposited
1030 erg of energy. The nonthermal electron ﬂux
> 4.8
was ﬁrst observed during the 14:04:40–14:04:56 UT in-
terval, peaked during the interval 14:06:40–14:06:56 UT,
68 seconds after the ﬁrst interval where the presence of
nonthermal electrons was detected, and had ceased by
14:10:32 UT.

During the peak interval, the ﬂux in nonthermal

electrons was calculated to be between 5.99

1010 erg s−1 cm−2, for a larger estimate of the foot-
point area (corresponding to 10% of the frame max-
imum for IRIS slit-jaw imaging) and 3.07

point area (the 50% of the frame maximum).

Lee et al. (2017) ﬁt the RHESSI spectrum of this event
for two intervals during this ﬂare, and calculated an en-
1010 erg cm−2 s−1 during the time in-
ergy ﬂux of 7.7
terval 14:05:32–14:06:32 UT. This is similar to the value
obtained for the time interval 14:06:16–14:06:32 UT of
1010 erg cm−2 s−1 for the more conserva-
8.37
tive 50% intensity threshold used to determine the area
of the energy injection region. These results presented
here are not compared with results from the second in-
1010 erg cm−2 s−1
terval shown by Lee et al. (2017) (6.1
at 14:11 UT). The diﬀerences between the these two
studies are primarily due to diﬀerences in footpoint area
determination and the determination of the low-energy
electron cutoﬀ. This study used the time-varying 10%
and 50% contours of IRIS imaging for footpoint area
determination while Lee et al. (2017) take the 60% con-
tour of RHESSI HXR imaging. This study additionally
allows the low-energy electron cutoﬀ to vary in time.
This results in a cutoﬀ between 5 and 8 keV higher than
the 30 keV assumed by Lee et al. (2017). The treat-
ment presented here additionally ﬁts for albedo eﬀects
and instrumental pileup.

×

In general, the low-energy cutoﬀ presented in this
work was higher than found in other, similar, studies,
particularly Milligan et al. (2014), who studied a ﬂare
of a similar size (X2.2). The study by Warmuth & Mann
(2016) contained several ﬂares of similar magnitude, all
of which had low-energy cutoﬀs less than found here.
Most similar was the X1.3 ﬂare of 2005 January 19,
studied by Warmuth et al. (2009), who found a low-
energy cutoﬀ between 30-40 keV during parts of that
event. Due to the low-energy electron electron cutoﬀ
level, the particularly steep slope of nonthermal emis-
sion, and the choice of a multithermal plasma model,
the derived electron power was, on the whole, weaker

nomenon component, with both cases yielding a similar
χ2. CLEAN images formed during this interval showed
no signiﬁcant sources of emission above the 30 keV low-
energy electron cutoﬀ derived during the nonthermal
electron event.

3.2. EIS Results

3.2.1. Lines formed below 10 MK

Fit-derived parameters from ions with temperature
T < 10 MK are shown in Figure 8 for the four
rasters spanning 14:02:39–14:16:56 UT. Line intensi-
ties, Doppler velocities, and nonthermal velocities are
shown as rows in Figure 8 for each raster time inter-
val, with ion formation temperature increasing left to
right across each row. Columns in Figure 8 correspond
to one emission line each (labelled at the top of each
column). Each parameter was scaled to the same range
across each time interval and temperature, to allow di-
rect comparison between ion species, and the location
of the ﬂare footpoint (from RHESSI 25–50 keV CLEAN
images) is overlaid in cyan. All HXR sources are part
of the eastern ﬂare footpoint; the western footpoint lay
outside the EIS FOV. Alignment between EIS rasters
and RHESSI imaging was performed by ﬁrst deter-
mining the oﬀset between EIS rasters and AIA ﬁlter-
grams using the eis_aia_offsets procedure available
in SSW, then aligning AIA ﬁltergrams with RHESSI
CLEAN maps. The alignment between AIA and EIS is
5(cid:48)(cid:48)(Mariska 2016). The accuracy
accurate to within
of alignment between AIA and RHESSI is accurate to
2.26(cid:48)(cid:48), within the minimum spatial resolution element
of RHESSI imaging. The middle column of Figure 1
shows the EIS FOV in context of the ﬂaring region for
comparison to the structures shown in Figure 8.

≈

In the rasters beginning at 14:06:13, UT, 14:09:48 UT,
and 14:13:22 UT, the velocity distribution found in EIS
spectral lines was typical of explosive chromospheric
evaporation. Within the ﬂare footpoint, warmer ions
exhibited strong blueshifts, while cooler ions exhibited
only redshifts. Given adequate temperature sampling,
the Doppler velocities EIS spectral lines can be used
to derive a range for the temperature of ﬂow reversal.
The ﬂow reversal temperature (FRT) is the tempera-
ture at which the division between evaporative upﬂows
and condensation-driven downﬂows occurs during peri-
ods of explosive chromospheric evaporation. Analysis of
Doppler velocities at or near this temperature provide
insight into the processes that transport energy from
the corona to the chromosphere (Brannon & Longcope
2014; Fisher et al. 1985). With six diﬀerent ion species
between T=1 MK and T=6.3 MK, the EIS observations

presented in this study are adequate to place constraints
on this temperature.

Figure 8 shows a clear delineation in Doppler velocity
cospatial with HXR emission between 1.35–1.82 MK,
ﬁrst observed in the 14:06:13 UT raster. This raster
spanned the time interval with the largest nonthermal
electron ﬂux density (Figure 7). The distribution of non-
thermal electrons during this interval was characterized
by a steepening power-law index. In this, and the two
following rasters, the Fe XII line, formed at 1.35 MK,
exhibited mild downﬂows within the ﬂare footpoint, on
10–40 km s−1, while the Fe XIV line,
the order of
formed at 1.82 MK, was blueshifted between
20
60 km s−1. The FRT fell within this 0.5 MK
and
range during this raster, and remained in this range
for the remainder of the ﬂare. This range is consistent
with limits determined in previous studies (Kamio et al.
2005; Milligan & Dennis 2009). Above this temperature,
spectral lines were observed to have increasingly strong
blueshifts, peaking at nearly -100 km −1 for the Ca XVII
line, while the cooler ions exhibited relatively consistent
redshifted emission across the three cool species studied,
including the weak Fe X line.

Minor evolution in the Doppler velocity distribution
was found throughout the duration of the ﬂare. The ear-
liest raster studied, which began at 14:02:39 UT, showed
markedly diﬀerent behaviour compared to later observa-
tions. Nonthermal emission from RHESSI observations
were ﬁrst observed at 14:04:40 UT, thus, this raster ob-
served both the pre-ﬂare and early-ﬂare chromosphere.
As early as 14:03:00–14:03:11 UT, ions warmer than the
FRT were observed to have blueshifted velocity enhance-
ments, 90 s before the RHESSI instrument detected
nonthermal emission. The Fe XVI ion, in particular
4.6 km s−1 in the region
displayed a blueshift of -68.9
that subsequently became the ﬂare footpoint. This early
velocity behaviour is more consistent with gentle chro-
mospheric evaporation (Schmieder et al. 1987; Zarro &
Lemen 1988), possibly driven by a nonthermal electron
component with an energy below the RHESSI sensitiv-
ity threshold.

The compact kernels of blueshifted emission appar-
ent in warm (
1.82 MK) ions during the 14:02:39 UT
raster expanded to ﬁll both lobes of the ﬂare ribbon
during the 14:06:13 UT raster. At this time, additional
blueshifted material bridged the two HXR sources. By
the 14:13:22 UT raster, while signiﬁcant upﬂows re-
mained in these species, they were mostly contained
within the eastern structure, while the larger, western
structure had begun to return to rest as early as the
14:09:48 UT raster. The blueshifted material bridging

the two HXR sources persisted through the 14:09:48 UT
raster, but is largely absent by 14:13:22 UT.

During the 14:02:39 UT raster, ions cooler than the
FRT (He II, Fe X, and Fe XII) exhibited small Doppler
velocity enhancements within the region that would
later become the ﬂare footpoint. The downﬂows in these
species peak during the 14:06:13 UT raster (for He II,
5.5 km s−1 during
downﬂows peaked at vmax = 41.7
this raster), gradually returning to rest over the remain-
ing duration. The results presented here are broadly
consistent with the results of Lee et al. (2017), who pre-
sented selected ion species within a point in the western
lobe.

±

Nonthermal velocities (calculated from the line width)
are shown in every third tow of Figure 8. The highest
nonthermal velocities derived from EIS spectral ﬁts were
found at cooler temperatures, speciﬁcally, those below
the FRT, and are largest for Fe XII and He II. The ion
observed by EIS with the smallest nonthermal velocity
was Fe XIV, which is formed at a temperature just above
the FRT. Ions warmer than Fe XIV showed higher non-
thermal velocities with increasing temperature. There is
little evolution in nonthermal velocity after 14:06:13 UT.
During the 14:02:39 UT raster, the nonthermal velocity,
particularly in Fe XIV, Fe XV, and Fe XVI was mildly
enhanced across the region that would later become the
ﬂare footpoint. Overall, the nonthermal velocities ob-
served are markedly similar in magnitude to those ob-
served by Milligan (2011), though the ﬂare studied in
that work was signiﬁcantly smaller (C1.1).

3.2.2. Lines formed above 10 MK

Figure 9 shows Doppler velocity behaviour for the
hottest EIS ions: Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV, with tem-
peratures of 14.13 and 18.20 MK respectively. The EIS
instrument observed one line of Fe XXIII, and two of
Fe XXIV. Of the three, the reference wavelength con-
straints for Fe XXIV 192.02˚A were most reliable, and
this line serves as the focus of this discussion.
In ev-
ery raster where these lines were present, the core was
accompanied by strong enhancements to the blue wing.
Figure 9 presents the ﬁts to the core and the blue wing
enhancement, with time increasing top to bottom for
the same four raster time intervals presented in Figure 8.
The six columns correspond to: Fe XXIII core and blue
wing, the Fe XXIV 255.13˚A core and blue wing, and the
Fe XXIV 192.02˚A core and blue wing, while the rows al-
ternate between intensity and Doppler velocity for these
four components. For the blue wing, Doppler velocity
was measured relative to the same reference wavelength
as the line core. Where the detector saturated observing
Fe XXIV 192.02˚A, or where there was insuﬃcient signal

to ﬁt the emission line, as was often the case outside the
ﬂare ribbon, the ﬁts were replaced with a null value.

During the 14:02:39 UT raster, no emission was de-
tected from the Fe XXIII line or the Fe XXIV 255.13˚A
line. The Fe XXIV 192.02˚A line, while faint, was present
in locations that later became a part of the footpoint
during this time interval.

An example of this early,

low-intensity emission is
shown in the top panel of Figure 10. Where it is present
at 14:02:39 UT, the magnitude of Doppler velocity for
Fe XXIV is small for the core, and the separation of the
wing is approximately constant.

Signiﬁcant Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV 255.13˚A emission
ﬁrst appeared during the 14:06:13 UT raster, and grew
in intensity with each successive raster. All three lines
exhibited core blueshifts within the footpoint at this
time, with further blue-wing enhancement. The Doppler
velocity of the blue wing peaked during the 14:06:13 UT
raster, and decreased thereafter.

Generally, these hot ions are expected to display a sta-
tionary core, with an enhanced blue wing (Milligan &
Dennis 2009). During the raster covering the ﬂare peak
(14:06:13 UT), however, the entire line complex for both
the Fe XXIII line, and the Fe XXIV line pair was signiﬁ-
cantly blueshifted. Within non-saturated footpoint pix-
els, the core of the Fe XXIV 192.02˚Aline was found to
have blueshifts as high as -240 km s−1, while maintain-
ing a blue wing enhancement. For the same proﬁle, the
blue wing velocity was as high as -480 km s−1, relative
to the same reference wavelength. By the 19:09:48 UT
raster, while core blueshifts were still found within the
ﬂare ribbon, the magnitude and extent were far less than
found one raster prior, and by 14:13:22 UT the core
of these lines had mostly returned to rest. Signiﬁcant
Doppler velocities observed in the “rest” component of
this line complex is not expected. An example of this
atypical behaviour is shown in Figure 10, which shows
the Fe XXIV 192.02˚Acomplex across three rasters from
the same location.

impulsive/beginning of the gradual phase, and after the cessation of nonthermal electron injection. Each raster time occupies
two rows (intensity and Doppler velocity for each time interval), while each ion occupies two columns (line core and blue wing).
The colorbar scale is consistent between ion species and observation times. At the earliest times, only Fe XXIV 192.02˚A displays
emission above the background. RHESSI 25–50 keV CLEAN imaging contours are overlaid in cyan on all images, corresponding
to 5%, 30%, and 70% of the image maximum.

within the ribbon exceed the limits of the intensity ra-
tio, reaching electron densities greater than 1012 cm−3,
with the highest densities over the largest areas found
in the 14:06:13 UT raster. Lee et al. (2017) focused on
a particular kernel of density enhancement, the peak of
which coincided with the SXR emission peak, with only
a smaller enhancement found at 14:06:13 UT. However,

enhancement is greatest during the peak of the nonther-
mal electron event, with much of the ﬁeld exceeding the
limits of the density relation.

Potential mechanisms responsible for excess line
broadening within the ﬂare ribbon can be investigated
by correlations of density, nonthermal velocity, and
Doppler velocity. A strong correlation between Doppler
and nonthermal velocity within the ﬂare ribbon may be
indicative of a blend of unresolved plasma ﬂows. Con-
versely, a stronger correlation between electron density
and nonthermal velocity would indicate other eﬀects,
such as opacity, pressure, or potentially even turbulent
broadening, are dominant. Measured correlations be-

The behaviour of the Fe XIV line pair stands in con-
trast with Milligan (2011), who found a strong correla-
tion between nonthermal velocities and densities within
the this line pair. The low correlations are more consis-
tent with the ﬁndings of Doschek et al. (2007), who stud-
ied plasma in a quiescent active region and also found
no evidence of such a correlation.

These correlations,

taken from temperatures sur-
rounding the FRT are a signature of explosive chromo-
spheric evaporation, as observed in the vicinity of a ma-
jor energy deposition layer. At temperatures above and
below the FRT, the nonthermal widths are likely due to
a superposition of unresolved ﬂows. Near the FRT, both
nonthermal and Doppler velocities were small, implying
that the Doppler velocity structure was well resolved.

3.3. IRIS Results

Line intensities, Doppler velocities, and nonthermal
velocities from IRIS spectral ﬁtting are shown in Fig-
ure 12 for each of the three ions ﬁt for pixels lying within
the ﬂare ribbon. Points lying outside the ﬂare ribbon
were masked. The left column shows the integrated
line intensity for C II 1335.71˚A, Si IV 1402.81˚A, and
Fe XXI 1354.07˚A, while the middle shows the Doppler
velocity, and the right shows nonthermal velocities. For
the bright C II and Si IV lines, the running mean of
each parameter is overlaid in orange, with the 1σ error
in the running mean overlaid as ﬁlled contours in the
same color.

tween these quantities within the ﬂare ribbon are pre-
sented in Table 2 for Fe XII, Fe XIV, Fe XV, and Fe XVI,
which span a 1.15 MK range. No correlations are pre-
sented with density for Fe XII, Fe XV, or Fe XVI, as
there are no reliable density measurements in these lines.
For the entire duration studied, neither Fe XIV line
exhibited any correlation between electron density and
nonthermal velocity. There is a weak correlation be-
tween nonthermal velocity and the Doppler shift of
the line core, with a peak correlation of

Fe XIV 264.81˚A during the early ﬂare 14:02:39 UT
raster. The two hotter lines exhibited correlation be-
tween nonthermal velocity and Doppler velocity during
the 14:02:39 UT raster. By the 14:06:13 UT raster, this
correlation is found only in Fe XVI. The cooler Fe XII
195.12˚A line only exhibits correlation between nonther-
mal and Doppler velocities after the peak of energy in-
jection. During the 14:06:13 UT raster, coincident with

The cool Si IV and C II ions, exhibit small Doppler
shifts. Over the duration of the event, 81% of Si IV
proﬁles, and 96% of C II proﬁles were redshifted, with
9.6 km s−1 at 14:09:19 UT and
peak velocities of 47.9
5.6 km s−1 at 14:07:16 UT, respectively. This
59.6
cool choromospheric condensation provides context for
EIS observations of He II. For example, He II exhibited
5.5 km s−1 during the
a maximum redshift of 41.7
14:06:13 UT raster. At this time (14:06:42 UT), Si IV
redshifts peaked at 27.6

9.4 km s−1.

More notable is the behaviour of the calculated non-
thermal velocity for Si IV. The running mean of this
quantity peaks at 14:05:49 UT, with a mean nonthermal
1.0 km s−1. This is coincident with the
velocity of 31.9
time of the hardest electron distribution, with a power-
law index less than 6. As the nonthermal velocities in
Si IV level oﬀ later in the ﬂare, and ﬁnally ﬂattens at
14:10 UT, the power-law index increases, until the non-
thermal electron event ceases shortly before 14:11 UT.
In the case of Si IV, at least, the excess widths calcu-
lated from spectral ﬁtting may be linked to line opacity
changes, driven by the deposition of energy from a par-
ticularly hard distribution of nonthermal electrons.

For the hot,

comparatively few spectra with signiﬁcant observable
emission, particularly at earlier times. The earliest in-
stance of an Fe XXI proﬁle that could be reasonably ﬁt

high levels of noise in the continuum as a consequence
of shorter exposure times. At later times in the ﬂare,
Fe XXI was observed to have Doppler velocities mostly
between 0– -80 km s−1, with outliers observed in ex-

The Doppler shifts presented here are observed ear-
lier and have values in excess of those proﬁles ﬁt by
Lee et al. (2017), who found no Fe XXI Doppler veloc-
ities in excess of -60 km s−1, which they measured at
14:10 UT, for a particular kernel of emission. Li et al.

However, their measured Doppler velocities were, over-
all, smaller. Comparable Doppler velocities were found
by Li et al. (2015), who studied an X1.0 ﬂare that oc-
curred on 2014 March 29, and found Fe XXI Doppler

All parameters in Figure 12 exhibited a large amount
of scatter. As only pixels within the ﬂare ribbon were
selected, the remaining scatter must be due to diﬀer-
ences across the ﬁeld-of-view. The spatial context for
these measurements is shown in Figure 13, which shows
the line intensities, Doppler velocities, and nonthermal
velocities along each raster. For the C II and Si IV lines,
the raster beginning at 14:08:21 UT was selected for the
high spatial coverage and low levels of saturation. For
the weak Fe XXI line, the entire time span was stacked
to provide a coherent depiction of the region of interest.
Where multiple Fe XXI proﬁles were present, the pa-
rameter of greatest magnitude was selected for display.
When displayed in this manner, it is apparent that
enhancements in C II and Si IV intensity, Doppler ve-
locity, and nonthermal velocity track the structure of
the ﬂare ribbon. The Fe XXI intensities, Doppler veloc-
ities, and nonthermal velocities, however, do not appear
to track the ﬂare ribbon. Rather, enhancements in these
parameters appear to trace the edges of a loop structure

Figure 14 shows Doppler and nonthermal velocities as
a function of temperature and time for a region within
the primary ﬂare ribbon. The IRIS data are cospa-
tial with EIS data, and approximately co-temporal to
the extent that the diﬀering cadences could be matched.
For ions that exhibited a strong blue-wing enhancement
(Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV), the Doppler velocities of the
core and wing components are included, as well as the
nonthermal velocity of the core component only.

The FRT was clear between Fe XII and Fe XIV. IRIS
observations showed redshifts from chromospheric con-
densation, which continued to the coolest temperatures
studied. Within the blueshifted lines, the Fe XXI line
observed with IRIS appeared to more consistent with
the blueshifts observed in the cores of the Fe XXIII and
Fe XXIV lines, rather than the blue wing enhancements
(which were noticeable outliers in Doppler velocity).

Nonthermal velocities increased with temperature
from the cool IRIS lines through the Fe XII line ob-
served by EIS. There was a sudden drop in nonthermal
velocity at this temperature, observed to some extent
in all time bins studied. Within the blueshifted lines,
the nonthermal velocity again increased with increasing
temperature approximately linearly through Fe XXIV.
The Fe XXI IRIS line ﬁt well into this linear relation.
By the 14:13:22 UT raster, while the break in nonther-
mal velocities was still present, the relation has become
a great deal more shallow when compared to the peak
raster at 14:06:13 UT.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, a notably-complete set of observations
were used to relate the ﬂare-driven nonthermal en-
ergy release with the response of the chromosphere.
The results presented here place an emphasis on the
time-resolved proﬁle of nonthermal electron-driven emis-
sion in conjunction with the evolving chromosphere.
The nonthermal electron distribution was provided via
RHESSI spectral ﬁtting, while emission lines observed
with the EIS and IRIS instruments probed the response
of the event in intensity, Doppler velocity, nonthermal
velocity, and density. As the nonthermal electron event
began and proceeded, the chromosphere was observed to
transition from gentle to explosive chromospheric evap-
oration, with densities and high-temperature velocities
peaking during the interval identiﬁed as the peak of non-
thermal electron energy deposition.

Solar ﬂares are true multiwavelength events in every
sense of the word, with telltale signatures across spec-
tral bands from radio to HXR. Events covered with a
wide range of instrumentation across a wide spectral
range are exceedingly rare (Milligan & Ireland 2018). A

connecting the two ﬂare ribbons visible in slit-jaw imag-
ing. A similar structure appears in the hottest EIS ions
(Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV) during the 14:09:48 UT and
14:13:22 UT rasters. As this structure is not visible in
any other EIS emission lines, the minimum temperature
of this structure must be between 6.31 MK (Ca XVII)
and 11.48 MK (Fe XXI).

holistic understanding of the generation, transport, and
deposition of ﬂare energies may be composed by integra-
tion of the many spectral windows provided by numer-
ous instruments in the current state-of-the-art. These
connected observations of the response of the chromo-
sphere to the call of electron injection are critical to
initializing models and guiding the results of numerical
simulations.

×

The injection of nonthermal electrons lasted 352 sec-
1030 erg into the
onds and deposited more than 4.8
chromosphere. Prior to the onset of nonthermal emis-
sion, gentle chromospheric evaporation was observed in
EIS rasters, characterized by compact blueshifted re-
1.35 MK. After this
gions observed in ions with T
time, the chromosphere responded explosively, with up-
ﬂows in excess of -50 km s−1 in Fe XVI, -65 km s−1 in
242 km s−1 in the
Ca XVII, and a core blueshift of
Fe XXIV line.

−

≥

During the period of explosive chromospheric evapo-
ration, several unique behaviours were observed in EIS
rasters. Most notable was the monolithic shift of the
Fe XXIV complex. Typically, the Fe XXIV line can be
well characterized by a stationary core, with a strong
enhancement to the blue wing, characterized by a blend
of Gaussian proﬁles. While this behaviour is observed
at various times during the event, EIS raster covering
the peak of the ﬂare (14:06:13 UT) exhibited monolithic
shifts of the entire Fe XXIV line complex, with little to
no stationary emission. This behaviour is greatly dimin-
ished by the start of the next raster, and absent by the
following.

The presence of blue wing enhanced spectral lines
at hot temperatures was ﬁrst noted in observations of
Ca XIX using the Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS)
aboard Yokoh by Doschek & Warren (2005). Milligan &
Dennis (2009) found similar proﬁles in EIS observations
of Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV lines during a solar ﬂare. This
behaviour was theorized to be a consequence of the low
spatial resolutions of these instruments (BCS in partic-
ular was a disk-integrated instrument). The low resolu-
tion had the eﬀect of superimposing stationary looptop
emission with blueshifted footpoint emission. Conﬁrma-
tion seemingly came with observations of the Fe XXI line
utilizing the higher-resolution IRIS instrument. Gra-
ham & Cauzzi (2015); Polito et al. (2015, 2016) found
that this line exhibited no notable asymmetry. Doschek
et al. (2013) and Brosius (2013) both found instances of
symmetric, blueshifted Fe XXIII proﬁles in an M1.8 and
C1 ﬂare, respectively. The behaviour exhibited by the
Fe XXIV line here, where the core of the line was found
to be highly blueshifted while maintaining an enhanced
blue wing is not an expected behaviour.

≥

This behavior may be attributed to a superposition of
unresolved ﬂows. During the peak of this ﬂare, several
atmospheric strata with temperatures
14.1 MK could
have formed. However, the absence of a stationary pop-
ulation of 14.1 MK plasma until late in the ﬂare remains
unexplained. That it is present later in the event could
indicate either that the stationary plasma was heated
beyond the 18.2 MK Fe XXIV formation temperature,
or that the looptop heating lagged behind the heating
of the ﬂare footpoint. RHESSI spectral ﬁtting showed
the presence of plasma as hot as 70 MK during the peak
of the ﬂare, and as hot as 40 MK by the time a strong
stationary core was observed at 14:13:22 UT.

The temperature sampling provided by the EIS in-
strument allowed constraints on the FRT, which was
found to be in the range 1.35–1.82 MK. This is compa-
rable to the FRT presented in Milligan & Dennis (2009),
between 1.5–2.0 MK, despite the diﬀerences in ﬂare size
(GOES C1.1 versus X1.6). This is similar as well to val-
ues presented by several other studies, including Gra-
ham et al. (2011) (1.25–1.6 MK for a C6.6 ﬂare), Young
et al. (2013) (1.1–1.6 MK for an M1.1 ﬂare), and Watan-
abe & Imada (2020), who found two FRTs; T<1.3 MK in
one region, 1.3<T<1.8 MK in another during an X1.8
ﬂare. Brannon & Longcope (2014), however, modeled
ﬂow reversal properties in ﬂares driven by thermal con-
duction, and found FRTs ranging from 0.526–4.78 MK,
with some evolution in time. While the FRT range
found for this event is similar to the range found in
much smaller events, the area aﬀected by the energy
input is signiﬁcantly larger, with a second ﬂare ribbon
well outside the EIS ﬁeld for this event. It may be that
ﬂow reversal always, or nearly always occurs around this
temperature, which is independent of deposited energy.
Every emission line studied exhibited line broadening.
In EIS rasters, the smallest nonthermal velocities are
found just above the FRT in the Fe XIV emission line
pair. The nonthermal velocities of EIS emission lines
increase up to the FRT, with a sudden drop in non-
thermal velocity just above temperature, before increas-
ing again to the highest temperatures. Two particular
emission lines, Si IV and Fe XXI, both observed by the
IRIS instrument, are of note. The Fe XXI line exhibited
broad, symmetric proﬁles, that were often low-intensity.
While the magnitude of the nonthermal widths of these
proﬁles are not unprecedented (Young et al. 2015; Lee
et al. 2017; Kerr et al. 2020), they are among the broad-
est yet observed (Graham & Cauzzi 2015; Polito et al.
2015, 2016). Broad, highly-shifted proﬁles in this line
appeared early in the ﬂare, prior to the peak of elec-
tron injection, implying that even relatively weak elec-
tron precipitation is suﬃcient to generate proﬁles with

20

Sellers, Milligan, & McAteer

large nonthermal widths, lending further questions as
to their generation (Polito et al. 2019). The cool Si IV
line also exhibited enhanced nonthermal widths, albeit
at a much lower level. These enhancements are notable
due to their similarity with the evolution of the nonther-
mal electron spectral index, implying that the nonther-
mal velocity enhancement at cool temperatures may be
linked directly to the deposition of energy in the lower
atmosphere by nonthermal electrons.

The electron density within the ﬂare footpoint, as
measured by the Fe XIV 264.81/274.23 ˚A ratio increased
by nearly two orders of magnitude in the minutes follow-
ing the onset of the electron injection event. Enhance-
ments in nonthermal velocity in Fe XIV were found to
be small and not correlated with the density or Doppler
velocity, standing in contrast to the ﬁndings of Milligan
(2011). The Fe XVI emission line exhibited correlation
between Doppler and nonthermal velocity, in agreement
with the ﬁndings of Milligan (2011) and Doschek et al.
(2013) for this emission line. A signiﬁcant correlation
was also observed between the Doppler and nonthermal
Fe XII velocities, suggesting that nonthermal velocities
in lines formed above and below the FRT originated
from unresolved velocity ﬂow structures along the line
of sight, similar to the ﬁndings of Young et al. (2013).

This

study combined temporally,

spatially and
spectrally-resolved, observations for a large number of
distinct emission lines. This set of ﬂare parameters
combined a time-dependant electron injection proﬁle
with a time-dependant chromospheric response, includ-
ing Doppler and nonthermal velocities, electron densi-
ties, and emission line intensities, with multiple rasters
covering the nonthermal electron event. In addition to
providing a detailed proﬁle of this large solar ﬂare, the
derived parameters can be used to guide and interpret
modeling of the atmosphere, using state-of-the-art hy-
drodynamic ﬂare simulation codes, such as HYDRAD
(Bradshaw & Mason 2003; Bradshaw & Cargill 2013),
RADYN (Carlsson & Stein 1997; Allred et al. 2005,
2015), or FLARIX (Kaˇsparov´a et al. 2009; Varady et al.
2010). Time-dependant parameters of nonthermal elec-
tron energy injection from RHESSI would be used to
provide the electron beam input. The chromospheric
response across temperatures from 104–107 K provides
guidance for the correlation of simulation outputs. To-

gether, this allows for both a deeper understanding of
the dynamic response of the chromosphere to an impul-
sive injection of energy, as well as the ability to constrain
the numerical simulations to the underlying physics.

Several unanswered questions remain: the speciﬁcs of
energy and mass transport in the post-ﬂare atmosphere
as driven by relatively-weak nonthermal electron heat-
ing; the origin and nature of symmetrical nonthermal-
broadened emission line proﬁles, especially in the ex-
treme case of Fe XXI; the origin of the oft-observed
blue wing asymmetry observed in the hottest Fe XXIII
and Fe XXIV emission lines; the unexpected shift of the
typically-stationary Fe XXIV line core; and the transi-
tion from gentle to explosive chromospheric evaporation.
Such questions can be answered in part by detailed sim-
ulations of coupled datasets containing both the coronal
call and the chromospheric response. In the era of multi-
wavelength solar observations, coordinated observations
of large solar ﬂares have become not only a possibility
but a necessity. As activity increases during the rise
of Solar Cycle 25, a new suite of instrumentation will
enable similar studies to be conducted in unprecedented
detail. Joining the venerable IRIS and EIS instruments,
whose capabilities have not yet been exhausted, are the
new STIX (Krucker et al. 2020) and SPICE (Spice Con-
sortium et al. 2020) instruments, aboard Solar Orbiter
(M¨uller et al. 2013), which will enable a new era of ob-
servations, both in terms of their capabilities, but also
their unique heliocentric positioning, which will be vital
for studying the activity that will accompany the rise of
this new solar cycle.
