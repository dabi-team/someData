Conformational analysis of the experimentally recorded IR absorption spectra of propanol in 

gaseous state and in a low-temperature argon matrix at 20 K and at 35 K was carried out for different 

spectral ranges. It showed that the conformational composition of the samples in gas and in matrix 

isolation is different. In gaseous propanol Gt conformers predominate, while in matrix isolation the 

most energetically favorable form is Tg conformer, which prevails in percentage at both considered 

temperatures of an Ar matrix. 

Introduction 

Propanol is one of the most useable alcohols for different applications, so it is 

widely  studied  both  by  experimental  and  theoretical  methods.  It  is  known  that 

molecules  of  monohydric  alcohols  can  form  different  cluster  structures  due  to 

hydrogen bonding [1-3]. Moreover, each molecule of alcohol with more than one atom 

of  carbon  can  be  found in different  conformations,  which  are  formed  as  a  result  of 

rotation  of  atoms  around  chemical  bonds  [4-6].  In  the  case  of  propanol  (structural 

formula CH2-CH3-CH3-OH), the molecule of which has two structural dihedrals, nine 

stable  configurations  exist:  one  plane  structure  and  four  pairs  of  enantiomers  (or 

mirror-image pairs). Since enantiomers have similar energy and optical properties, the 

difference  between  them  is  usually  neglected.  As  a  rule,  propanol  conformers  are 

designated by a symbolic title using a generally accepted scheme of dihedral angles 

CCCO+CCOH via big+small letters for trans- (T, t), gauche- (G, g) and gauche'- (G', 

g') conformers [6, 7]. 

Conformational properties of propanol were studied in supersonic jets [6, 8] and 

cryogenic  matrices  [6,  9],  in  gas  and  liquid  phases  [7],  in  CCl4  solutions  at  low 

concentrations  [10].  The  aim  of  the  presented  work  is  to  analyze  experimentally 

registered IR absorption spectra of propanol in gaseous state and in matrix isolation, 

and to compare conformational composition of the samples studied. 

 
 
 
Experimental  

Liquid  propanol  with  purity  >  99.9  from  Fluka  was  used  for  experimental 

investigations. Atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen were removed from the alcohol by 

five  freeze-pump-thaw  cycles.  Gas  phase  samples  were  obtained  by  the  natural 

evaporation in vacuum process from the liquid surface.  

FTIR  spectra  of  propanol  in  gaseous state  were  measured  using  conventional 

single pass 10 cm gas cell equipped with KBr windows with the resolution 0.5 cm-1 

using deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector. The gas cell was filled with an 

alcohol using standard vacuum technique. Pressure of the alcohol in the cell was set 

close to its saturated pressure at 20o C: 2 mbar. 

Conformational analysis of gaseous propanol  

Spectral region of OH stretching vibrations  

Fig. 1 presents  the  spectral  band of  the  stretching vibrations of free  hydroxyl 

groups (3600 – 3750 cm-1) of gaseous propanol.  A complicated shape of this band is 

due to the vibrations of different conformers of propanol molecule as well as vibrations 

of non-bonded hydroxyl groups of dimers and bigger clusters [11-13].

vibrations of free OH groups

 In [14] the following assignment of the absorption bands to different propanol 

conformers  was  made:  3682  cm-1  –  Gt  conformer, 3679  cm-1  –  Tt  conformer, 3669     

cm-1  –    Gg',  3660  cm-1  –  Tg  and  3657  cm-1  –  Gg.  As  is  seen  from  Fig.1,  one  can 

distinguish an intense band at 3682 cm-1, which can be assigned to vibrations of  Gt 

conformer. In addition, there are bands at 3657 and 3669 cm-1, which can be assigned 

to  conformers  Gg  and  Gg'.  IR  absorption  bands  of  Tt  and  Tg  conformers  are  not 

observed in this part of the spectrum, or their intensity is too low.  Therefore, we can 

draw the conclusion that conformations with gauche- orientation of С – С bond – Gt, 

Gg and Gg' – dominate in the studied sample of gaseous propanol. 

Moreover, spectral bands of molecules, which are proton acceptors in dimers, 

with frequencies 3654, 3671 and 3675 cm-1 were found in [14]. All these three bands 

were  found  in  our  sample,  too.  In  fig. 1,  D  denotes the  dimer  bands.  Besides  these 

identified bands there are other ones (for example, 3647 cm-1), which can belong to 

vibrations of free OH groups in bigger clusters – trimers and so on.  

Spectral region 800 – 1300 cm-1 

In the spectral region from 800 to 1300 cm-1 the stretching vibrations of a carbon 

skeleton of the propanol molecule (i.e. С  –  С and  С  –  О  bonds)  are located.  Fig. 2 

presents FTIR spectrum of gaseous propanol in the corresponding range.

The stretching С – С vibrations of conformers with trans-configuration in respect 

to С – С bond (they are  denoted as Тх) have frequencies 881 and 885 cm-1 [14], and 

the corresponding vibrations of conformers of Gx group are located in the range 850 – 

860  cm-1.  In  the  experimentally  registered  spectrum  of  gaseous  propanol  there  are 

vibrations at these frequencies, but they are of low intensity. 

In the spectrum presented in Fig. 2 the most intense absorption is observed at 

1065 cm-1. This band corresponds to a more high-frequency part of a doublet appearing 

at interaction of the stretching С – С and С – О vibrations [14]. However, this band 

gives few information about dominating conformations, since calculated frequencies 

for all five conformers are located in the range 1050 – 1100 cm-1. The second, low-

frequency component of the doublet, is more informative: vibrations of Тх conformers 

are observed at 1014 and 1025 cm-1, while vibrations of  Gx conformers are located 

between  965  and  972  cm-1  [14].  Therefore,  the  observed  absorption  maximum  at 

1020 cm-1 can be assigned to Тх vibrations, and the band at 972 cm-1 – to Gx vibrations. 

The comparison of intensities of these two bands allows concluding that Gx conformers 

dominate in the investigated sample, which agree with the conclusions drawn from the 

analysis of the spectral region of the stretching ОН vibrations.  

In  addition  to  skeleton  vibrations,  in  this  region  there  are  also  bending  OH 

vibrations. According to [14], bending OH vibrations in Gt conformer manifest at 1222 

cm-1,  and  the  corresponding  vibrations  of  Tt  conformer  –  at  1235  cm-1.  In  the  IR 

spectrum in Fig. 2 one can notice both of these bands, and an intensity of Gt band is 

higher than that of Tt band, indicating domination of Gt form over Tt one.  

Spectral region of stretching С – Н vibrations 

Fig. 3 presents IR absorption spectrum of gaseous propanol in the spectral range 

of the stretching С – Н vibrations. According to [15], the absorption band near 2890 

cm-1  corresponds to  the symmetric  stretching  С-Н vibrations in  СН3 group, and the 

band at 2972 cm-1 – to antisymmetric stretching С-Н vibrations in СН3 group. Between 

them, the symmetric stretching С-Н vibrations of СβН2 group are located. According 

to the assignment from [16 - 18], the band at 2942 cm-1 belongs to the conformer Tg, 

the band at 2952 cm-1 – to the conformer Gg. It means that the most intense vibrations 

 
 
in this region correspond to conformers, which have  ОН group in gauche- position. 

Absorption frequencies of conformers with hydroxyl group in trans- position are lower 

by several tens of wavenumbers. However, in the registered spectrum absorption at 

these frequencies is low.

vibrations  

Conformational analysis of propanol in matrix isolation  

Matrix  isolation  in  low-temperature  matrices  of  inert  gases  allows  registering 

vibrational spectra of individual molecules or small clusters without their interaction 

with environment. Moreover, in contrast to the spectra of a substance in the gas phase, 

the  vibrational  bands  in  the  obtained  spectra  are  not  complicated  by  the  rotational 

structure. This fact allows making a detailed assignment of registered bands to different 

conformers or clusters of different sizes. In this section, IR spectra of propanol in low-

temperature argon matrix are considered. For samples preparation, propanol vapor was 

mixed with argon in ratio 1:1000 (one propanol molecule per 1000 argon atoms), then 

the obtained gas mixture was deposited at a cooled to 20K window. As a result, one 

can  register  IR  spectra  of  propanol  molecules  or  small  clusters  and  analyze 

conformational composition of propanol in matrix isolation.

Spectral region of stretching ОН vibrations 

Fig. 4 presents IR spectrum of propanol trapped in an Ar matrix at 20 K in the 

spectral region 3640 – 3680 cm-1. In this part of the spectrum, the stretching vibrations 

of  non-bonded  hydroxyl  group  are  manifested.  These  non-bonded  OH  groups  can 

belong to monomers and proton acceptors in dimers as well as bigger chain clusters.  

Fig. 4 – IR spectrum of propanol trapped in an Ar matrix at 20 K in the spectral region 

of stretching OH vibrations  

 As is seen, the spectral band in fig. 4 has a complex contour with a number of 

maxima.  The  maxima  at  3657,  3659,  3660,  3663,  and  3665  cm-1  are  assigned, 

respectively, to the vibrations of Gg, Tg, Gg', Tt and Gt conformers. This assignment 

was made according to the results of IR absorption of propanol conformers in an Ar 

matrix in this spectral region [19]. Analyzing relative intensities of the spectral bands 

corresponding to the stretching OH vibrations of five different propanol conformers 

one can say that conformers with gauche-configuration of ОН group (i.e. Gg, Tg and 

Gg') dominate in the investigated sample. The intensity of the bands corresponding to 

Tt  and  Gt  conformers  is  essentially  lower,  indicating  that  the  number  of  these 

conformers  (with  OH  group  in  trans-  position)  in  the  sample  is  much  less.    It  is 

interesting to note, that in the gas phase the domination of Gt conformer was observed 

in  this  spectral  region.  Apparently,  during  the  cooling  of  the  gas  mixture  and  the 

364036503660367036800,00,51,01,5Gg'Gg  GtDDabsorption, a.u.wavenumer, cm-1TgTtD 
 
deposition  of  the  matrix,  a  transition  from  one  form  to  another  occurred,  and  the 

conformational composition of the sample changed. This is confirmed by the results of 

our quantum-chemical calculations [20], according to which the lowest energy barrier 

(about 3.2 kJ/mol) is observed between Gt and Gg 'conformers, that is, the transition 

from Gt conformation to Gg' conformation is the most probable. 

In  addition  to  the  vibrations  of  propanol  monomers,  spectral  bands  of  OH 

stretching vibrations of free  (i.e., not involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds) 

hydroxyl groups of small propyl alcohol clusters are also observed in this frequency 

range. Such free hydroxyl groups are inherent in molecules that act as proton acceptors 

in the formation of larger dimers or open clusters. According to [14], IR absorption 

bands of propanol dimers appear at frequencies of 3654, 3671, and 3675 cm-1. In the 

spectrum  in  Fig.  4  all  three  of  these  bands  are  present  (denoted  by  the  letter  D), 

although they have a relatively low intensity. This fact indicates the presence of a small 

(compared to monomers) amount of dimers in the sample under study. Note that dimers 

were  also present in the gas phase of propanol, as evidenced by the analysis of the 

spectra of gaseous propanol in the same spectral range (see Fig.1).  

Registered  maxima  of  IR  bands  of  propanol  monomers  and  dimers  in  an  Ar 

matrix in the spectral region of the stretching vibrations of free hydroxyl groups as well 

as their assignments are listed in Table 1.

Moreover,  in  the  spectrum  in  Fig.  4  one  can  notice  other  low-intensity  IR 

absorption  bands,  for  example,  at  frequencies  of  3643,  3644,  3648  and  3650  cm-1, 

which most likely belong to clusters consisting of three or more molecules. Note that 

a band at 3647 cm-1 was also registered in gaseous propanol and was attributed to the 

vibrations  of  trimers.  Thus,  it  can  be  concluded  that  both  in  gaseous  propanol  and 

during its isolation in a low-temperature argon matrix, not only individual propanol 

molecules in different  conformations  exist  there,  but  also  hydrogen-bonded  clusters 

consisting of two, three and more molecules are formed.      

It is interesting to consider how the conformational composition of the sample 

under study changes with an increase in the temperature of the argon matrix. In fig. 5  

the IR absorption spectrum of propanol in an argon matrix at 35 K in the spectral region 

of stretching vibrations of the free hydroxyl group is presented.  

Fig. 5 – IR absorption spectrum of propanol isolated in an argon matrix at 35 K 

in the region of OH stretching vibrations 

As can be seen from Fig.  5, with an increase in the temperature of the argon 

matrix to 35 K, the contributions of all propanol conformers remain in the absorption 

band  of  the  free  OH  group,  but  the  intensity  of  the  Tt  conformer  absorption  band 

noticeably increases compared to the other bands. This fact indicates a redistribution 

of the number of different conformers in the sample during its heating: the percentage 

364036503660367036800,00,51,01,5GtDGg'absorption, a.u.wavenumber, cm-1TtDDGgTg 
 
 
 
of  conformers  with  gauche  orientation  of  the  hydroxyl  group  decreases  and  the 

proportion  of  Tt  conformers  increases.  This  redistribution  is  most  likely  due  to 

relaxation transitions from the Tg and Tg 'conformations to the Tt conformation, since 

the calculated height of the energy barrier between the Tt, Tg, and Tg' conformers is 

about 7 kJ/mol.  

Spectral region of stretching С – Н vibrations 

Fig. 6 presents IR absorption spectrum of propanol in an Ar matrix at 20 K in 

the spectral region of the stretching С – Н vibrations. In this region, symmetric and 

antisymmetric stretching vibrations in СН3 group at 2886 and 2973 cm-1 are the most 

intense, similarly to the picture observed for the gas phase (see Fig. 3). Between these 

two vibrations, there are symmetric stretching vibrations of CβH2 group. In contrast to 

the  corresponding  absorption  bands  in  the  gas  phase,  for  which  a  strong  overlap  is 

observed (Fig. 3), the matrix isolation method allows the bands of different conformers 

to be separated.  

Fig. 6 – IR spectrum of propanol trapped in an Ar matrix at 20 K in the spectral 

region of stretching С – Н vibrations  

In Fig. 6 one can distinguish five bands of СβН2 vibrations corresponding to five 

different propanol conformers [16, 18]: the band of Tt conformer at 2907 cm-1, the band 

of Gt conformer at 2918 cm-1, the band of Gg' conformer at 2930 cm-1, the one of Tg 

conformer at 2936 cm-1 and of Gg conformer at 2948 cm-1. From the distribution of the

relative intensities of these five bands, it can be concluded that conformers with gauche 

orientation of the hydroxyl group, i.e. conformers of the Xg/g' type, predominate in the 

sample  under  study.  This  conclusion  completely  coincides  with  the  results  of  the 

analysis of  the spectral  region of  OH vibrations  for  this sample,  which additionally 

confirms the correctness of the conclusions made above.   

Fig. 7 – IR spectrum of propanol trapped in an Ar matrix at 35 K in the spectral 

region of stretching С – Н vibrations  

As  the  temperature  of  the  matrix  rises  to  35  K,  no  noticeable  changes  in  the 

spectrum in the spectral region of stretching CH vibrations occur. This is illustrated in 

Fig. 7, which shows the corresponding part of the IR absorption spectrum of propanol 

isolated in an argon matrix at a temperature of 35 K. The maxima of all the observed 

absorption bands remain at the same positions as at a temperature of 20 K. Only a slight 

narrowing  of  the  bands  of  individual  conformers  can  be  noted,  which  leads  to  the 

formation of sharper maxima. 

Spectral region of skeletal vibrations  

Fig. 8 shows the IR absorption spectrum of propanol isolated in an argon matrix 

at a temperature of 20 K in the range of wavenumber from 800 to 1150 cm-1, where the 

skeletal vibrations of the alkyl chain, i.e. stretching vibrations of C - C and C - O bonds, 

are located. In this part of the spectrum, rather narrow bands are observed, making it 

possible to assign them with high accuracy to various conformers of propanol.

Fig. 8 – IR absorption spectrum of propanol trapped in an Ar matrix at 20 K in 

the spectral region 830 – 1120 cm-1 

At 859 cm-1 a band of Gt conformer is observed, and at 883 cm-1 - of a mixture 

of Tx conformers, similar to that in gaseous propanol (see Fig. 2).   

One  of  the  most  intense  absorption  bands  in  this  part  of  the  spectrum  at  a 

frequency of 968 cm-1 corresponds to the vibrations of the conformers of  Gx group. 

This assignment was made based on a comparison of the results of quantum-chemical 

simulation of the IR absorption spectra of various propanol conformers performed by 

the B3LYP/6-311+G(d), MP2/6-311+G(d) and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ methods with the 

experimentally recorded spectrum of propanol in an argon matrix [14]. Calculations 

showed the presence of this band in the spectra of the conformers Gt, Gg, and Gg ', and 

its absence in the spectra of the conformers Tt and Tg. Another band of approximately 

the same intensity was recorded at a frequency of 1055 cm-1. According to the same 

calculations, vibrations at this frequency are present in the spectra of the Tt, Tg, and 

Gt conformers.  

Using  the  results  of  quantum  chemical  calculations  and  experimental  studies 

from [14], we assign the bands at 1020 and 1024 cm-1 to the vibrations of Tg and Tt 

conformers,  respectively.  At  a  frequency  of  1066  cm-1,  the  absorption  band  of  Gg' 

conformer is observed, and at a frequency of 1102 cm-1 - of Gg conformer.  

After analyzing the ratio of the intensities of the IR absorption bands of various 

conformers in this part of the spectrum, it can be concluded that Gx-type conformers 

8509009501000105011000,00,51,01,52,0Gt, Tt, Tgabsorption, a.u.wavenumber, cm-1TgTtGxGg`GgGtTx 
 
prevail  in  number  over  Tx-type  conformers.  In  addition,  there  are  slightly  more  Tt 

conformers than Tg conformers, and the number of Gg structures is slightly less than 

Gg '. 

When  the  sample  was  heated  to  35  K,  no  significant  changes  in  the  spectral 

pattern were observed. Fig. 9 shows the same region of the IR absorption spectrum of 

propanol in an argon matrix, but at a temperature of 35 K. It can be seen that the only 

difference from the spectrum at 20 K is the practically equal intensities of the bands 

corresponding to the Tt and Tg conformers. In addition, an insignificant increase in 

absorption on the  right wing of the Gx  band and a splitting of the Gg' band can be 

observed,  which  may  be  associated  with  the  appearance  of  additional  bands  in  the 

spectrum as a result of the formation of larger propanol clusters with an increase of the 

sample temperature.

Spectral region of bending ОН vibrations 

Let us consider separately the spectral region 1100 - 1300 cm-1, where bending 

OH vibrations of propanol are manifested. The corresponding part of the recorded IR 

absorption spectra of propanol isolated in an argon matrix at temperatures of 20 K and 

35 K is shown in Fig. 10 and 11, respectively. As can be seen, vibrations of all five 

propanol conformers are recorded in this region, the assignment of which was carried

modeling presented in [14].

Quantum-chemical  simulation  of  IR  absorption  spectra  of  various  propanol 

conformers shows that bending OH vibrations of Tt conformer appear at a frequency 

of  1232  cm-1,  and  ones  of  Tg  conformer  –  at  a  frequency  of  1228  cm-1.  The 

corresponding  absorption  band  of  the  Gt  conformer  is  located  at  a  frequency  of 

1222 cm-1, and the vibrations of the Gg conformer manifest as a shoulder of this band

at 2019 cm-1. For Gg' conformer the calculated frequencies of bending OH vibrations 

are somewhat lower - about 1130 cm-1. 

All the bands listed above are observed at both temperatures, but with slightly 

different intensity distributions. In addition, the spectrum contains bands at frequencies 

of  1240,  1246,  and  1252  cm-1.  Since  the  intensity  of  these  bands  increases  with 

increasing temperature, it can be assumed that they belong to propanol clusters.   

Conclusions 

Conformational analysis of the experimentally recorded IR absorption spectra of 

propanol  in  gaseous  state  and  in  a  low-temperature  argon  matrix,  carried  out  for 

different spectral ranges, showed that the conformational composition of the samples 

in these two cases is different. 

Analyzing  the  region  of  OH  stretching  vibrations  in  gaseous  propanol,  the 

predominance of Gt structures, as well as the presence of the Gg and Gg' structures, 

was observed. This composition of the sample in the gas phase is also confirmed by 

the  results  of  the  analysis  of  the  spectral  region  of  bending  OH  vibrations,  which 

indicate the predominance of the Gt form over Tt, and the region of skeletal vibrations, 

according to which conformers of the Gx type prevail over those of Tx.  

When propanol is isolated in an argon matrix, a redistribution occurs between 

the  ratios  of  conformers  in  the  sample.  Analysis  of  the  range  of  OH  stretching 

vibrations shows the predominance of the Tg conformer, but the number of Gg and Gg' 

conformers is not much less. The slight predominance of structures of the Tx type over 

Gx is also evidenced by the distribution of the intensities of the recorded absorption 

bands in the spectral intervals of bending OH vibrations and skeletal vibrations of the 

alkyl chain. The spectral region of stretching СН vibrations turned out to be the least 

informative both in the case of a gaseous sample and in the case of matrix isolation. 

Thus, the results of our studies show that gaseous propanol contains the largest 

number  of  Gt  conformers,  which  are  the  most  stable  of  the  five  possible  propanol 

conformers according to a number of quantum mechanical calculations [8, 14, 21]. The 

propanol molecules isolated in a low-temperature argon matrix are influenced by the 

 
 
environment;  therefore,  in  this  case  the  most  energetically  favorable  form  is  Tg 

conformer, which prevails in percentage.
