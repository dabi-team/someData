ABSTRACT

More than two decades ago, the Galileo probe performed in situ measurements of the composition of
Jupiter’s atmosphere and found that the abundances of C, N, S, P, Ar, Kr and Xe were all enriched by
factors of 1.5–5.4 times their protosolar value. Juno’s measurements recently conﬁrmed the supersolar
N abundance and also found that the O abundance was enriched by a factor 1–5 compared to its
protosolar value. Here, we aim at determining the radial and temporal evolution of the composition
of gases and solids in the protosolar nebula (hereafter, PSN) to assess the possibility that Jupiter’s
current composition was acquired via the direct accretion of supersolar gases. To do so, we model the
evolution of a 1D α−viscous accretion disk that includes the radial transport of dust and ice particles
and their vapors, with their sublimation and condensation rates, to compute the composition of the
PSN. We ﬁnd that the composition of Jupiter’s envelope can be explained only from its accretion from
PSN gas (α ≤ 10−3), or from a mixture of vapors and solids (α > 10−3). The composition of the PSN
at 4 AU, namely between the locations of the H2O and CO2 icelines, reproduces the one measured
in Jupiter between 100 and 300 kyr of disk evolution. Our results are found compatible with both
the core accretion model, where Jupiter would acquire its metallicity by late accretion of volatile-rich
planetesimals, and the gravitational collapse scenario, where the composition of proto-Jupiter would
be similar to that of the PSN.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Galileo probe performed in situ measurements of
the composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere up to ∼22 bars
of pressure (Wong et al. 2004). These measurements in-
dicated C, N, S, P, Ar, Kr and Xe abundances that were
found 1.53 to 6.08 times higher than their protosolar val-
ues (Mousis et al. 2018), and subsolar abundances for Ne
(∼0.10 protosolar; Mahaﬀy et al. 2000) and O (∼0.46
protosolar; Wong et al. 2004). The subsolar abundance
of Ne in the upper troposphere has been explained by
the sinking of liquid Ne with He (Mahaﬀy et al. 2000). It
has also been proposed that the O subsolar abundance
measured by the Galileo probe is indicative of a tar– or

a carbon–rich planet (Lodders 2004; Mousis et al. 2012).
However, the Galileo O measurement has also been at-
tributed to the speciﬁcity of the probed region, which
appeared water depleted (Orton et al. 1998). This hy-
pothesis is supported by the recent H2O abundance mea-
surements by the microwave radiometer (MWR) aboard
the Juno orbiter, which were performed in the equato-
rial region of Jupiter up to 30 bars of pressure (Li et al.
2020). With this instrument, the H2O and NH3 abun-
dances were found to be 1–5.1 and 2.6–2.9 times higher
than the protosolar abundances of oxygen and nitrogen,
respectively, at a 1-σ level.

Two main models of giant planets formation currently
exist, namely the core accretion model and the gravita-
tional instability model. In the gravitational instability
model, planetary formation begins with the protosolar
nebula (PSN), breaking up due to its own self-gravity

into giant protoplanets of solar composition, which then
accrete planetesimals from the PSN (Cameron 1978;
Boss 1997; Helled et al. 2006). In this scenario, Jupiter
accretes its volatile content in 10-100 kyr. In the core
accretion model, a solid core of ∼10 M⊕ is ﬁrst formed
from planetesimals, which then accretes gas and even-
tualy leftover planetesimals from the PSN (Pollack et
al. 1996; Hueso & Guillot 2005). Here, the accretion of
planetesimals occurs over several Myr. Both scenarios
rely on the accretion of planetesimals, which diﬀers by
the time and rate at which this accretion occurs. The
amount and the nature of accreted material impact the
ﬁnal composition of the giant planet, and depend on
the local composition of the PSN at the time of planet
formation. Thus, measurements of the composition of
gas giants from both our own solar system and other
planetary systems, give constraints on the formation
mechanism of those planets. More recently, a variant
of the core accretion model has been proposed, in which
the solid core is agglomerated from pebbles via stream-
ing instability (Lambrechts & Johansen 2012; Booth et
al. 2017; Johansen & Lambrechts 2017). These studies
focus on the ﬁnal composition of giant planets formed
in the framework of the pebble accretion scenario, us-
ing multiple prescriptions for accretion rates and plane-
tary migration from 2D and 3D simulations (Johansen &
Lambrechts 2017; Booth et al. 2017; Schneider & Bitsch
2021a). In this kind of model, the evolution of volatiles
in the forms of vapors, dust or pebbles in the PSN is de-
termined by the locations of the various icelines. Models
of radial transport of dust, pebbles and gases in the PSN
show that the sublimation and condensation around ice-
lines change the local composition of solids and gases in
the PSN, the accretion of which, in turn, aﬀecting the
ﬁnal composition of the formed planets (Desch et al.
2017; Mousis et al. 2019; Aguichine et al. 2020; Mousis
et al. 2020). The ﬁnal composition of the gas giant then
depends on many factors: composition of the accreted
solids and gases, structure of the ices in solids (pure
condensate, amorphous ice or clathrate hydrate), disso-
lution of accreted planetesimals in the envelope, atmo-
spheric escape of lighter constituents, erosion of the core
and so on (Owen et al. 1999; Gautier et al. 2001; Mousis
et al. 2019, 2021).

The present study aims at determining the radial and
temporal evolution of the composition of gases and solids
in the PSN to assess the possibility that Jupiter’s cur-
rent metallicity was acquired via the direct accretion of
supersolar gases. To do so, we explore the evolution of
the PSN metallicity that allows it to reproduce that ob-
served in Jupiter. The PSN material considered includes
volatiles both in vapor and solid form. These solids are

more or less gas-coupled, and their sizes range from a
few microns to those of pebbles. All this material is
assumed to form Jupiter’s growing envelope, regardless
of any particular formation mechanism. Our study al-
lows us to investigate the relative contributions of the
diﬀerent volatile reservoirs –gases or solids– to Jupiter’s
current metallicity, assuming it did not evolve with time
after formation was completed. We assume that the icy
part of dust and pebbles corresponds to pure conden-
sates formed along the diﬀerent icelines. We compare
the most up-to-date measurements of the composition of
Jupiter’s atmosphere with the composition of the PSN
computed with our 1D α-viscous disk model (Aguichine
et al. 2020; Mousis et al. 2020). Our model provides us
with constraints on Jupiter’s formation time and loca-
tion in the PSN, and gives insights on the composition
and dynamics of the PSN.

2. OVERVIEW OF THE MODEL

The model used for this study is the one described in
Aguichine et al. (2020) and Mousis et al. (2020). Our
code mimics the evolution of a 1D α-viscous disk of
surface density Σg(r), which corresponds to the mass
density integrated over the azimuthal coordinate. The
disk is assumed to be both isothermal and in hydrostatic
equilibrium in the vertical direction. The disk’s surface
density is obtained by integrating the following equation
(Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974):

In this relation, the viscosity ν is computed in the frame-
work of the α-formalism:

ν = α

s

.

(2)

where α is the viscosity parameter, cs is the isothermal
sound speed and ΩK is the Keplerian frequency. The ra-
dial midplane temperature proﬁle T (r) includes the con-
tributions of viscous heating, constant background radi-
ation term, and, depending on the considered case (see
Section 4), direct irradiation from the Sun (Nakamoto
& Nakagawa 1994; Hueso & Guillot 2005).

At the beginning of the computation, the disk is
uniformly ﬁlled with the trace volatile species H2O,
CO, CO2, CH3OH, CH4, N2, NH3, PH3, and H2S
whose abundances are calculated as follows. All el-
emental abundances are set to their protosolar val-
ues (Lodders et al. 2009). Carbon is distributed as
CO:CO2:CH3OH:CH4 = 10:30:1.67:1, a ratio consistent

Gerasimenko (Le Roy et al. 2015; L¨auter et al. 2019),
and the leftover oxygen is used to make H2O. All phos-
phorus is in the form of PH3 while half of the sulfur is
in the form of H2S (Pasek et al. 2005). The remaining
sulfur is in refractory form and it is assumed that it sank
to the core of Jupiter during accretion. By doing so,
refractory sulfur presumably did not contribute to the
S abundance of the envelope. The possible dissolution
of these sulﬁdes in the envelope is discussed in Sec. 4.
Nitrogen is also distributed between N2 and NH3 in the
PSN, assuming N2:NH3 = 9:1, based on Spitzer obser-
vations of cloud cores and protostars ( ¨Oberg et al. 2011;
Pontoppidan & Blevins 2014). Refractory dust, which
does not sublimate or recondense, is also considered in
our trace species. The dust abundance ﬁlls the condi-
tion Ztot = Zice + Zdust = 0.0153 (Lodders et al. 2009),
where Ztot, Zice and Zdust are the total metallicity of the
protosun, the metallicity of the ices, and the metallicity
of dust, respectively. The corresponding abundances are
summarized in Table 1. At t = 0, the solid-to-gas ratio
is equal to Ztot beyond all icelines, and Zdust within the
H2O iceline, which is the innermost iceline.

fractions of the molecular cloud.

The surface densities of trace species are evolved with
an advection-diﬀusion equation (Birnstiel et al. 2012;

with species X being either in the form of solids ΣX,s(r)
or vapors ΣX,v(r). In vapor phase, the radial velocity
vX,v and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient DX,v are taken equal
to those of the H2/He gas vg and ν, respectively. The
dynamics of dust grains is based on the two-population
algorithm developed by Birnstiel et al. (2012). The ra-
dial velocity of dust grains resulting from gas drag and
radial drift is given by (Birnstiel et al. 2012; Aguichine
et al. 2020):

where St is the particle’s Stokes number (see Aguichine
et al. 2020, for details) and we assume DX,s = 1
1+St2 ν (cid:39)
ν. In the regimes considered here, the Stokes number fol-
lows the same trend as the particle’s representative size,
which only depends on the local solid-to-gas ratio (Birn-
stiel et al. 2012; Aguichine et al. 2020). Small particles
for which St (cid:28) 1 are dragged by the PSN gas (vX,s (cid:39) vg
in Eq. (4)), but grow fast. Larger grains (St ∼ 1) ex-
perience less gas drag, but are subject to strong inward
drift. At each time and location, one dust grain is as-
sumed to be a mixture of all solid species, weighted by
the surface density of each of them. Sublimation and
condensation rates ˙QX are computed as in Dra˙zkowska
& Alibert (2017).

We deﬁne the iceline of a given volatile species X as
the heliocentric distance corresponding to the condition
1. Figure 1 shows the time evolution of
ΣX,s = ΣX,v
the positions of the icelines in the PSN. During the disk
evolution, solid grains drift inward and sublimate, form-
ing an iceline for each volatile species. As the disk cools
down, the diﬀerent icelines move inward in time. Due to
the presence of a large number of small grains, the total
icy surface available for sublimation or condensation is
large and yields to signiﬁcant sublimation and conden-
sation rates. As a result, ices drifting within their ice-
lines are almost instantaneously vaporized. Conversely,
vapors diﬀusing beyond their icelines eﬃciently recon-
dense into their solid forms. Consequently, each trace
species is mostly in the solid phase beyond its iceline
(ΣX,s + ΣX,v (cid:39) ΣX,s), and is predominantly in vapor
phase within its iceline (ΣX,s + ΣX,v (cid:39) ΣX,v).

The disk evolution is ruled by its non-dimensional vis-
cosity parameter α, as its value impacts the disk size
and dynamics. A higher value of α generates a more

decreases the sensitivity of our results regarding the
choice of the initial composition.

In this study, we focus on the composition of the PSN
at 4 AU, chosen as the formation location of Jupiter.
This distance plausibly corresponds to a position in
the disk beyond the H2O iceline but inward of the ice-
lines of all other trace species.
In our model, this lo-
cation is speciﬁcally between the icelines of H2O and
CO2, which make up ∼52% by mass of all trace species
(volatiles + refractories) from Table 1. The dust-to-gas
ratio in the vicinity of these icelines can easily become
2–3 times larger than the one derived from a mixture
of protosolar composition (see Fig. 2), easing the for-
mation of proto-Jupiter’s core via streaming instability
(Yang et al. 2017). Also, the local increase of the total
gas surface density can generate hydrodynamic instabil-
ities (vortices) that lead to gravitational instabilities by
dust particles capture, forming giant protoplanets over
timescales (∼10 kyr) much shorter than the lifetime of
the PSN (Lovelace et al. 1999; Lovelace & Romanova
2014; Surville & Barge 2015; Barge et al. 2016). Choos-
ing a diﬀerent radius (e.g. 5.2 AU, the current orbit of
Jupiter) will not modify trends in our results as long as
the chosen distance is between the icelines of H2O and
CO2. This makes our model compatible with both the
Nice model and the Grand Tack hypothesis, in which
Jupiter is formed at 5.4 AU or 3.5 AU, respectively
(Brasser et al. 2009; Walsh et al. 2011).

3. RESULTS

Figure 2 represents the enrichment proﬁles of H2O
(fH2O,φ(r, t)) and CO (fCO,φ(r, t)), both in solid and
vapor phases, as a function of heliocentric distance at
several epochs of the PSN evolution. The inward drift
of solid grains leads to a signiﬁcant decrease of the sur-
face density of solids beyond the H2O and CO icelines,
and to an increase of the surface density of vapors near
the icelines themselves. The formed vapors diﬀuse out-
ward and recondense back in solid forms, creating an
abundance peak at the iceline of each species.
In our
model, the diﬀusivity of vapors is taken to be equal to
the diﬀusivity (viscosity) of the H2+He gas, leading to a
fast homogenization of the vapor concentrations in the
inner regions of the disk. This region of nearly con-
stant vapor to gas ratio is referred to as a enrichment
plateau. A larger α–value increases the eﬃciency of tur-
bulent mixing, and generates more uniform surface den-
sity proﬁles of vapors in the inner disk. The enrichment
plateau of H2O vapor reaches a maximum after 100–400
kyr of the PSN evolution, depending on the α–value.
This plateau then decreases as vapors get accreted by
the Sun. Similar trends can be observed for the CO

extended disk, and the growth in radial exchange of an-
gular momentum also increases the values of the diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcients of the gas and trace species. The value
of α does not directly impact the dynamics of solids.
However, α–values as low as those considered here im-
ply a slow diﬀusion of the PSN gas. Consequently, a
signiﬁcant inward drift of large grains will result in a
high dust–to–gas ratio in the innermost regions of the
PSN, and a low dust–to–gas ratio in the outermost re-
gions of the PSN. A larger viscosity also increases the
viscous heating, pushing the diﬀerent icelines slightly
further. The values of α explored with our model is in
the ∼10−4–10−2 range, based on models calibrated on
disk observations (Hartmann et al. 1998; Hueso & Guil-
lot 2005; Desch et al. 2017).

The supersolar metallicity of Jupiter’s envelope is as-
sumed to be acquired from the PSN as a mixture of H-He
gas mixed with trace species in vapor and/or dust forms.
To compare the PSN composition with that of Jupiter,
the surface density proﬁles of the diﬀerent species are
converted into enrichment proﬁles. The time and radial
evolution of the enrichment of a given species X in the
PSN is then deﬁned by:

fX,φ(r, t) ≡

X/H(r, t)
(X/H)(t=0)

=

ΣX,φ(r, t)/Σg(r, t)
(ΣX/Σg) (t = 0)

, (5)

where r, t, and φ, are the heliocentric distance, time, and
the phase of species X (solid, vapor, or their sum), re-
spectively. Species enrichments are then converted into
elemental enrichments, which are normalized to their
protosolar abundances. This normalization signiﬁcantly

enrichment proﬁle. However, as vapors form at larger
heliocentric distances, it takes more time for them to
diﬀuse inward and become uniform. The blue shaded
region shows Juno’s measurements of H2O to H abun-
dance, relative to the protosolar O/H abundance. This
indicates the time and location at which Jupiter and the
PSN have similar O content, if one considers that only
H2O or CO contributes to Jupiter’s O abundance.

Figure 3 shows the time evolution of the enrichments
(fX,φ(4AU, t)) of the diﬀerent trace species X listed in
Table 1 at the heliocentric distance of 4 AU. Top, mid-
dle and bottom panels correspond to the enrichments in
solid+vapor phases, vapor phase, and solid phase, re-
spectively. Here, the diﬀerent volatile species embedded
in drifting particles are released to the PSN gas phase
when they cross their corresponding icelines, due to sub-
limation. As formed vapors diﬀuse inward, their abun-
dances increase at 4 AU. Because the drift timescale of
pebbles is much smaller than the diﬀusion timescale of
the vapors, the vapor abundances (top panels of Figure
3) only start to increase close to the positions of the
various icelines (Fig. 1). With time, the disk becomes
depleted in the diﬀerent species, implying the decrease
of their abundances at 4 AU. If one of the icelines crosses
the 4 AU distance, the corresponding species condenses,
but the total abundance remains unchanged. Since the
H2O iceline is always located inside 4 AU, it is mostly
present in solid form.

Figure 4 represents the time evolution of the elemental
enrichments in solid+vapor phases (top panels), vapor
phase (middle panels), and solid (bottom panels) at 4
AU, respectively. These enrichments are compared with
the measured abundances of C, N, S, P and noble gases
that are found to be between ∼1.5 and 5.4 times pro-
tosolar (Mousis et al. 2018; Li et al. 2020). Due to its
large uncertainty, the O enrichment is discussed in Sec-
tion 4. Since C, N and O are distributed among several
molecules, their abundances present several enrichment
peaks that are caused by the presence of multiple ice-
lines.

In the solid+vapor phase, high α–values produce sim-
ilar elemental enrichments. When the α–value is 10−2,
all elemental enrichments in our model match the 1.5–
5.4 range at t ∼ 200 kyr. The only exception to that
rule is S, whose enrichment is too small, since half of
this element is assumed to stay in refractory species.
Because both C and O are enriched by the same fac-
tor, the C/O ratio remains protosolar (∼ 0.5). Similar
trends are found when α = 5 × 10−3, but enrichment
peaks are higher. Here, enrichments of P, N and no-
ble gases match the 1.5–5.4 range at two distinct epochs
located at the two sides of the peaks (t = 100 and 400

kyr). Because of the fast accretion of CO2 and H2S onto
the Sun, the PSN is depleted in C and S after 400 kyr
of PSN evolution, but matches Jupiter’s composition at
t = 100 kyr with supersolar O. When α is ≤ 10−3, the
eﬀect of icelines becomes more important, and enrich-
ment peaks are even higher. The C and O enrichment
peaks are ﬁrst caused by the enrichment peak of CO2 at
t = 150 kyr (see Fig. 3), and then caused by the enrich-
ment peak of CO at t ∼2 Myr. Peaks in N enrichment
are due to NH3 at t = 150 kyr and N2 at t ∼1 Myr.
Here, our results match the 1.5–5.4 enrichment range in
a very narrow time domain around t (cid:39) 300 kyr.

When the α–value is ≥ 5 × 10−3, C and O abundances
in the vapor phase exhibit two peaks at 100 and 200 kyr.
Because CO2 is the main C– and O–bearer, its dynam-
ics greatly impacts the C and O abundances. At times
earlier than 100 kyr, C and O abundances increase due
to the inward diﬀusion of CO2 vapor down to 4 AU. At
later times, the CO2 iceline moves below 4 AU, leading
to a decrease of C and O abundances in the vapor phase.
The second peak for C and O at 200 kyr is caused by
the enrichment in CO vapor (by a factor of 10, as seen
in Fig. 3). However, due to the depletion in H2O va-
por, which is in solid phase at 4 AU, the C enrichment
is twice higher than the O enrichment. This yields a
C/O ratio of ∼1 (twice the protosolar ratio). Similarly
to the behavior of CO2, H2S condenses at 150 kyr, and
decreases the S abundance in the vapor phase around
this location. When α is ≤ 10−3, volatiles in the PSN
are mostly in the form of vapor. The composition of the
vapor phase is thus almost identical to the aforemen-
tioned solid+vapor case, and our results reproduce the
elemental enrichments measured in Jupiter at 300 kyr
of the disk evolution at 4 AU.

Our calculations show that Jupiter’s metallicity can be
explained by the accretion of vapors only at t (cid:39) 300 kyr
when the α–value is lower or equal to 10−3. However,
the dual accretion of vapors and pebbles at t = 100 −
−300 kyr by the forming envelope is more likely when
larger α–values are considered.
In those cases, solids
may have contributed to the C and O enrichments in
the forms of H2O and CO2 ices.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this work, we ﬁnd that, depending on the choice
of the value of the viscosity parameter, the metallicity
of Jupiter’s envelope can be explained only from its ac-
cretion from PSN gas (α ≤ 10−3), or from a mixture of
vapors and solids (α > 10−3). The composition of the
PSN at 4 AU reproduces Jupiter’s metallicity at epochs
in the 100–300 kyr range, regardless the α–value. Spe-
ciﬁc times are summarized in Table 2, depending on the

compounds from the outermost regions of the PSN to
Jupiter’s formation location.

After 300 kyr of PSN evolution, elemental enrichments

and never ﬁt the 1.5–5.4 range together (α ≤ ×10−3).
In both cases, our results indicate that Jupiter’s for-

Myr is highly unlikely because after this epoch the PSN
becomes depleted in volatiles. This result is consistent
with the recent work of Schneider & Bitsch (2021b) who
proposed a formation model of Jupiter consistent with
its current composition. These authors ﬁnd that for-
mation by pebble and gas accretion requires (cid:39) 3 Myr,

resulting in planets with mostly subsolar abundances.
To reproduce the observed metallicity, the authors em-
ulated the accretion of ∼30 M⊕ of solids in an ad hoc
way to form the current planet, a mass in agreement
with the range found by Mousis et al. (2021), assuming
the solids were composed of several types of ices.

We outline that the concept of giant planet formation
from pebbles still poses some issues. Such models con-
sider Type I and Type II migration, which arise from the
exchange of angular momentum between the planet and
the viscous disk (Kley & Nelson 2012; Baruteau et al.
2014). This exchange of angular momentum creates a
torque acting on the planet’s orbit, resulting in a change
of orbital parameters, e.g. the orbital radius. Both Type
I and Type II migration share the same physical ori-
gin, but take place at diﬀerent planet mass regimes, and
mainly result in inward migration. Type I and Type II
migration are expected to be signiﬁcant with α–values
≥ 5 × 10−4. Numerical models show that a growing
planetary embryo injected at 4 AU can migrate inward
down to an orbit of ∼0.5 AU (Booth et al. 2017; Jo-
hansen & Lambrechts 2017; Schneider & Bitsch 2021a),
impeding the formation of an envelope with a superso-
lar metallicity. These models show that with such small
α-values, stabilizing a Jupiter-like planet at the helio-
centric distance of 5 AU requires that its core must have
formed beyond 10 AU. However, this distance is located
beyond the positions of all the icelines considered in our
model, suggesting that forming a supersolar envelope

from vapors or vapors + solids is incompatible with the
radial transport of volatiles in the form of pebbles and
vapors through multiple icelines. However, recent 2D
and 3D simulations that model planet-disk interactions
point out that Type I and II migration rates are several
times lower than those given by prescriptions available
in the literature (Chrenko & Nesvorn´y 2020; Lega et al.
2021; Chametla & Chrenko 2022). Those results indi-
cate that an in situ formation of Jupiter remains a viable
hypothesis, which is the hypothesis adopted here. This
highlights the current lack of understanding regarding
the trajectory of planets formed in circumstellar disks.
Alternative models, such as those requiring accretion
of pebbles and planetesimals with appropriate compo-
sitions at diﬀerent stages of the formation of Jupiter
(Alibert et al. 2018; Mousis et al. 2021), must be then
considered to remain compatible with the core accretion
model.

The local increase of the vapor surface densities of
CO2 and/or H2O at 4 AU and t = 150–300 kyr produces
an axisymmetric bump of the gas surface density, which
can trigger hydrodynamical instabilities leading to the
formation of a vortex (Lovelace et al. 1999; Lovelace &
Romanova 2014). Hydrodynamical simulations in pro-
toplanetary disks show that vortices are eﬃcient at con-
centrating pebbles in just a few hundreds of orbits (∼10
kyr) (Surville & Barge 2015; Barge et al. 2016). This in
turn could lead to a gravitational collapse that formed
the young Jupiter with a composition similar to that of
the PSN. Although our model is compatible with the
development of such instabilities, current simulations of
vortices are only eﬃcient in the formation of planetesi-
mals or planetary embryos. It is yet to be shown that
vortices can fully form gas giant protoplanets that eﬃ-
ciently accrete gas and vapors from the PSN. Our model
also does not include accretion of the envelope over time,
which can produce a gradient of metallicity in the planet

Figure 4. Same as Fig. 3, but for elemental enrichments. When an element is assumed to be present in only one species (e.g.
P in PH3, or noble gases), the enrichments are identical to those of Fig. 3. Since C, N and O are distributed among several
molecules, their enrichments exhibit several peaks. For example, when α ≤ 10−3, enrichment peaks of N in vapor+solid and
vapor phases (top and middle rows) are due to NH3 at 150 kyr, and N2 at ∼1 Myr. When α ≥ 5 × 10−3, the iceline of CO2
moves below 4 AU after 100 kyr of PSN evolution, which results in a decrease of the C and O abundances in the vapor phase
(middle row) and an increase in the C and O abundances in the solid phase (bottom row).

interior. This can give additional constraints on the ac-
cretion timescale required to reproduce Jupiter’s metal-
licity proﬁle (Debras & Chabrier 2019).

For α–values larger than 5×10−3, the recondensations
of CO2 and H2O at their respective icelines also produce
local bumps in the solid–to–gas ratio (see Fig. 2) that
may trigger streaming instabilities (Lambrechts & Jo-
hansen 2012; Johansen & Lambrechts 2017). At these
locations, Jupiter would be formed with a C– and O–
rich core and a C– and O–poor envelope, while keeping
supersolar overall C and O abundances. In this context,
core erosion could explain Jupiter’s supersolar metallic-
ity (Stevenson 1982, 1985; Guillot et al. 2004; Soubiran
et al. 2017). This could also produce a metallicity gradi-
ent in Jupiter’s interior. We also note that, in both cases
of streaming and hydrodynamic instabilities, refractory
species, including sulfur compounds, may be partially or
totally dissolved in the envelope. However, quantifying

this eﬀect requires modeling that is beyond the scope of
the study.

Our calculations have been made assuming that the
O determination in Jupiter (1 − 5.1 times protosolar O)
corresponds to the 1-σ level. At a 2-σ level, this value
becomes 0.1–7.5 times protosolar O (Li et al. 2020). This
implies the possibility that the O abundance in Jupiter’s
envelope could be subsolar as well. One way to obtain
a subsolar O abundance at 4 AU is to increase the H2O
abundance by decreasing that of CO2. This is the case
when one assumes that CO was the main C-bearer in the
outer PSN, as predicted by some thermochemical models
(Lewis & Prinn 1980). By doing so, more solid H2O and
less CO2 vapor are available at 4 AU. Because most of
the O is in form of H2O ice, formation by accretion of
gas and vapors only will result in a subsolar abundance
of O in Jupiter’s envelope.

In the broader context of the formation of Saturn,
Figures 1 and 2 show that the PSN also presents super-

solar abundances in volatile elements at ∼10 AU. This
is due to the presence of multiple icelines at this loca-
tion. The accumulation of volatiles at this heliocentric
distance due to the inward drift of icy particles could
also give a natural explanation of the observed composi-
tion of Saturn. In the meantime, the same process leads
to a rapid depletion in volatiles of the outermost regions
of the PSN, implying that our model cannot explain the
high metallicity of the ice giants. We attribute this lim-
itation of our model to the fact that gas and ice giants
are formed by diﬀerent formation processes.

We have shown that the metallicity of Jupiter’s enve-
lope can be achieved in the PSN, with volatiles being
in vapor phase only, or a mixture of solids and vapors.
Other processes (late accretion of planetesimals, core
erosion etc.) may explain Jupiter’s metallicity, but their
consideration is beyond the scope of this paper. Further

developments in the modeling of Jupiter’s deep interior
will provide a better knowledge of its interior structure
and composition, which will help discriminating between
various formation scenarios.
