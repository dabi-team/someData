The eﬀect of ionisation quenching for ions is critical for experiments relying on the measurement
of low energy recoils, such as direct Dark Matter searches. We present ionisation quenching factor
estimates over a range of energies for protons, α-particles, and heavier ions in H2, CH4, N2, Ar,
CO2, and C3H8 gases, estimated from the respective reference W-value measurements. The resulting
ionisation quenching factors are compared with predictions from SRIM.

INTRODUCTION

Direct searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles em-
ploy a range of detector technologies, including liquid
noble gases [1–4], crystals [5], and semiconductors [6].
Gaseous detectors are used to expand DM searches be-
low the Lee-Weinberg mass bound of about 2 GeV [7],
through the use of light-nuclei gases, and for directional
DM searches [8, 9].

The NEWS-G experiment, using a spherical pro-
portional counter ﬁlled with a neon-methane gas mix-
ture [10], set the most stringent exclusion limit at
the time in the DM-nucleon spin-independent interac-
tion cross section for a 500 MeV mass DM candidate.
The TREX-DM experiment [11], using a gaseous Time
Projection Chamber (TPC) with argon-isobutane and
neon-isobutane gas mixtures,
is projected to achieve
competitive sensitivities in the DM candidate mass
region below a few GeV. Directional DM searches
such as DRIFT [12], CYGNUS [13], MIMAC [8] and
NEWAGE [14] employ low-pressure (below a few hun-
dred millibar) TPCs with the ability to infer the ioni-
sation track direction. Additionally, many of these de-
tectors utilise gas mixtures containing odd-proton, e.g.
19F, or odd-neutron isotopes, e.g. 3He, to achieve world-
leading sensitivity to spin-dependent DM-nucleon inter-
actions.

Knowledge of the expected amount of ionisation and
scintillation induced by nuclear recoils is important for
these searches, which rely on the detection and mea-
surement of nuclear recoils with energy from a few eV
to hundreds of keV, induced by elastic scattering of DM
particles on nuclei. As a result, several investigations
of the corresponding ionisation quenching eﬀects have
been performed [15–21].

Low energy nuclear recoils dissipate energy in a
medium through inelastic Coulomb interactions with
atomic electrons, referred to as electronic energy losses,
and elastic scattering in the screened electric ﬁeld of the

nuclei, referred to as nuclear energy losses. Electronic
energy losses dominate for fast ions, while nuclear en-
ergy losses are increasingly important for decreasing ion
kinetic energy ER, and become dominant for ion veloc-
ities smaller than the electron orbital velocity [22]. The
produced secondary recoil atoms and electrons may also
undergo scattering, further transferring energy to other
particles.

The ionisation quenching factor, qf , concept was in-
troduced by Lindhard et al. [23], and remains a ﬁeld of
intense study [24]. The electronic and nuclear stopping
power are estimated assuming they are uncorrelated.
Integrating the electronic and nuclear energy losses un-
til the ion stops provides the energies v and η given to
atomic motion and electrons, respectively. The maxi-
mum available energy for ionisation and scintillation is
η. The Lindhard quenching factor is deﬁned as η/ER,
the ratio of energy given to electrons over the ion kinetic
energy.

SRIM [25] (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter)
is a computational tool primarily used for the estima-
tion of ion ranges in matter. TRIM (TRansport of Ions
in Matter), a module of SRIM, is often used to esti-
mate the ionisation quenching factor in materials as it
provides estimates for the fraction of ion kinetic en-
ergy dissipated in electronic and nuclear energy losses,
including contributions of secondary recoils. SRIM es-
timates of the ionisation quenching factor of heavy ions
in their own gas are presented in Fig. 1.

In the literature, multiple deﬁnitions of the ionisa-
tion quenching factor may be found depending on the
application:

1. the fraction of the ion kinetic energy that is
dissipated in a medium in the form of ionisa-
tion electrons and excitation of atomic and quasi-
molecular states;

2. the ratio of the “visible” energy in an ionisation

detector to the recoil kinetic energy; and

3. the conversion factor between the kinetic energy
of an electron and that of an ion that result to the
same “visible” energy in the ionisation detector.

tor on energy in liquid noble gas detectors [29], and
attempted to expand the work of Lindhard et al.
to
atomic gases and molecular gases, and their binary mix-
tures [30].

In this article, ionisation quenching factors are esti-
mated for a range of gaseous targets by exploiting avail-
able measurements of the mean ionisation energy W
for electrons and ion species. Measurements of W have
been the topic of intense investigations for over a cen-
tury [31, 32], with improved experimental methods and
increased precision over time.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

In the following, a brief description of the theoretical
investigations on W is provided and the connection to
the ionisation quenching factor is discussed.

Figure 1: Quenching factor for ions in their own gas
estimated using SRIM [25].

A. Description of the W-value

In the above, the ﬁrst deﬁnition coincides with that
of Lindhard et al. Moreover, the term “visible” refers to
energy dissipated in a detectable form for the speciﬁc
detection system, i.e. ionisation for detectors measuring
charge.

For the experimental determination of the ionisation
quenching factor in a material, the amount of ionisa-
tion induced by an ion species has to be measured as
a function of its kinetic energy and compared to the
corresponding ionisation by electrons of the same ini-
tial energy. In this case the ionisation quenching factor
takes the form,

qf = Ed/ER ,

(1)

where Ed is the amount of electronic energy losses “vis-
ible” to a detector [8, 9].

For these measurements, ions with precisely known
kinetic energy are required, along with the capability
to measure small energy deposits. As a result, although
the ionisation quenching factor is critical for the mod-
elling of the detector response to nuclear recoils — and,
thus, for the sensitivity to discover DM — relevant mea-
surements are scarce for low energy ions in gases. San-
tos et al. [26], investigated the quenching of He+ in
He/C4H10 gas mixtures using a table-top low energy
ion-electron accelerator [27]. The measurements were
performed with a Micromegas proportional counter [28].
The ionisation quenching factor was estimated as the
ratio of the energy measured in the detector for ions to
their initial total kinetic energy. Beyond measurements,
prompted by the requirements of the DM community,
Hitachi estimated the dependence of the quenching fac-

The average energy expended by ionising radiation to
produce an electron-ion pair inside gaseous and liquid
media, or an electron-hole pair in solids, is denoted by
W . When all of the kinetic energy E of the ionising
particle is deposited in a medium the W -value is:

W = E/Ni

(2)

where Ni
is the mean number of electron-ion (or
electron-hole) pairs created. It is assumed that any sec-
ondary particles produced during the energy loss pro-
cess, e.g. δ-electrons, bremsstrahlung photons, or elec-
tron and nuclear recoils, also dissipate their energy in
the medium and the produced electron-ion pairs are in-
cluded in Ni [31].

The W-value contains all the required information
for converting the kinetic energy dissipated by ionis-
ing radiation in a medium to electric charge, and vice
versa. The magnitude of the W-value is the outcome of
the competition between ionising and non-ionising pro-
cesses, such as excitation of atomic electrons and molec-
ular degrees of freedom, dissociation processes (neutral
fragmentation) in molecular gases, and production of
neutral atomic recoils. As a result the W-value also de-
pends on the interacting particle species and, in general,
tends to a constant value for increasing energy.

1. The W-value in pure gases

An intuitive explanation of the W-value magnitude
for the simplest case of fast electrons in pure gases was
provided by Platzman [33], based on energy balance
arguments. The kinetic energy is apportioned in three

0246810Energy [keV]0.00.20.40.60.81.0Quenching FactorSRIMHe+ in HeNe+ in NeAr+ in ArXe+ in XeH+ in HeH+ in NeH+ in ArH+ in Xeparts: a) production of electron-ion pairs; b) production
of discrete excited states or neutral dissociation frag-
ments; and c) production of sub-excitation electrons,
with kinetic energy below the lowest electronic excita-
tion energy of the medium.

This relation is written as:

E = Ni ¯Ei + Nex ¯Eex + Ni(cid:15)

(3)

where ¯Ei is the mean energy transfer per electron-ion
pair, Nex is the mean number of excited states pro-
duced, ¯Eex is the mean energy transfer per excited
state, and (cid:15) is the mean kinetic energy carried by sub-
excitation electrons. Dividing by Ni results in:

W = ¯Ei +

Nex
Ni

¯Eex + (cid:15)

(4)

The W-value is more naturally expressed relative to the
ﬁrst ionisation threshold I of the gas:

W

=

¯Ei

Nex

¯Eex

(cid:15)
I

(5)

Since every term on the right-hand side of Eq. 5 depends
on the energy of the ionising particle, the W-value also
exhibits an energy dependence, which becomes weaker
for E (cid:29) I. Platzman uses helium as an example to
demonstrate the completeness of the approach, where
the magnitude of each term for high energies is:

1.71 ≈ 1.06 + 0.85 · 0.40 + 0.31

(6)

Each term on the right-hand side of Eq. 6 has been de-
rived from methods other than the absolute measure-
ment of the W-value, which is shown on the left-hand
side. The magnitude of these terms provides a sense
of the apportionment of the ionising electron’s kinetic
energy. The value of 1.06 for the ratio ¯Ei/I is greater
than one because of the production of excited and mul-
tiply charged ions. This eﬀect is present in all noble
gases and is further enhanced in molecules thanks to
the larger number of available degrees of freedom. The
term ¯Eex/I is in general less than one but close to it
because the energy levels of most excited states lie be-
low or close to I. The ratio Nex/Ni depends strongly
on the atomic and molecular dynamics, taking values
of approximately 0.5, 1, and 2 for closed-shell atoms,
molecules, and free radicals, respectively [33]. Finally,
the ratio (cid:15)/I is smaller than unity because by deﬁnition
sub-excitation electrons have energy lower than I, and
this is the part dissipated as heat. The value of approx-
imately 0.3 applies to most noble gases but is less than
that for molecules because molecular ions retain more
energy than atomic ions [31]. Overall, high energy ion-
ising particles have a W/I ratio of 1.7–1.8 in noble gases
and 2.1–2.5 in molecular gases.

2. W-value dependence on particle species and energy

The W-value depends on the ionising particle species
and energy. For electrons with energy lower than a few
keV, the cross section for electronic excitation increases
with respect to that for ionisation as the electron energy
decreases [34]. The electron W-value as a function of
kinetic energy is, typically, described as:

W (E) =

Wa
1 − U/E

(7)

where Wa is the asymptotic W-value for E (cid:29) I and U is
a constant close to the average energy of sub-excitation
electrons [35]. This relation is in agreement with mea-
surements in a number of gases including nitrogen,
methane, and propane, down to low energies [36–38],
although some measurements suggest a stronger depen-
dence [39]. This is discussed in detail in Refs. [31, 32].
The energy dependence of the W-value for charged
hadrons, such as protons, α-particles, mesons, and
heavy ions is more complicated as it involves a larger
number of reactions compared to electrons. During the
energy loss process, in addition to secondary electron
generation, electron capture and loss cycles are tak-
ing place. Moreover, collisions of ions with atoms and
molecules result in energy transfers that may lead to fur-
ther ionisation when ion velocities become comparable
with electron orbital velocities. When ions carry elec-
trons, as expected for slow ions, collisions with atoms
and molecules give a number of products, including en-
ergetic ions and molecular fragments, that may result
in further ionisation. A theory description that reli-
ably predicts the W-value is not yet available and cross
sections for the individual process are under investiga-
tion [22].

The energy balance formulation of Platzman can be
extended for ions by adding the contribution of neutral
recoils created during the cascade [23]:

E = Ni ¯Ei + Nex ¯Eex + Ni(cid:15) + Nnr ¯Enr

(8)

Dividing by Ni gives:

Wion = ¯Ei +

Nex
Ni

¯Eex + (cid:15) +

Nnr
Ni

¯Enr

(9)

where Nnr is the number of neutral recoils produced
and Enr is their average kinetic energy. Other terms
keep their original meaning as in Eq. 3. The Ni ¯Ei and
Nex ¯Eex terms include ionisation and excitation, respec-
tively, induced by the secondary ions in addition to that
induced by the secondary electrons.

B. Relation of the W-value and the ionisation
quenching factor

Table I: W-values for electrons in various gases. The
asymptotic W-values are derived from the ﬁts shown
in Fig. 2.

4

The W-values for diﬀerent ionising radiations encap-
sulates all necessary information to estimate diﬀerences
in the amount of induced ionisation. The quenching
factor parametrises these diﬀerences. In Section I, three
deﬁnitions of the quenching factor were outlined. The
ﬁrst quenching factor deﬁnition is experimentally acces-
sible only in the case where a detector is able to mea-
sure the total amount of energy deposited by an ion
in electronic energy losses, ionisation and excitations,
as a fraction of its total kinetic energy. The two other
deﬁnitions can be measured with a detector relying on
ionisation.

For a particle of energy E depositing all of its en-
ergy in the detector, there will be Ni = E/W primary
electrons produced. The detector will record a signal S
proportional to Ni where the constant of proportional-
ity G includes the response of the read-out electronics
and any electron multiplication. The detector can be
calibrated with electrons of known kinetic energy in or-
der to relate the signal recorded with the corresponding
energy deposited in the detector, S → E. In the case
of electrons, the corresponding signal for a given energy
deposited will be Se = G · N e
i = G · E/We(E). For ions
of the same kinetic energy the corresponding signal will
be Si = G · N i
i = G · E/Wi, which, through the cali-
bration, would be interpreted as an electron equivalent
energy Eee = N i
i · We(E). Eee is the energy visible to
the detector, thus, from Eq. 1 the quenching factor can
be written as:

qf (E) =

Eee
E

=

N i

i · We(E)
E

=

We(E)
Wi(E)

(10)

When the kinetic energy is over a few keV, far away
from the energy region where the W-value for electrons
is energy dependent, the quenching factor can be de-
rived from the ratio of the asymptotic W-value for elec-
trons Wa over the W-value for ions Wi in the same
medium. This is the case in the second deﬁnition, and
is equivalent to Eq. 10 when We → Wa.

In the third deﬁnition of the quenching factor, the
energy dependence of We is retained, and thus accounts
for the eﬀective quenching of electrons at energies below
a few keV.

III. QUENCHING FACTOR ESTIMATION

veyed multiple studies of W-values. The gases stud-
ied are H2, CH4, N2, Ar, CO2, C3H8 and W-values for
electrons, protons, α-particles, and constituent ions are
included. These gases are frequently used as counting
gases and quenchers in proportional counters [42], and
as components of tissue-equivalent gases, used to em-
ulate energy deposition in the human body. Further-
more, these are of particular interest as targets for rare
event searches with gaseous detectors.

A. W-value measurements for electrons and ions
in various gases

The electron measurements by Combecher et al. [37],
Waibel and Grosswelt [36, 40, 41] are presented in
Fig. 2, and demonstrate the discussed energy depen-
dence of the W-value. CO2 data from Ref. [37] were
not used due to their discrepancy with other published
measurements and calculations [32]. The data for each
gas are ﬁtted with Eq. 7 using Wa and U as free param-
eters to estimate the asymptotic W-value for electrons
in each gas. Only measurements for electron kinetic
energies substantially larger than the ﬁrst ionisation
threshold are included in the ﬁt. The measurement un-
certainties are dominated by systematic eﬀects, which
are assumed to be fully correlated across the considered
energy range. These results are summarised in Table I.
The resulting asymptotic W-values appear higher than
those suggested by ICRU [31] for high energy electrons.
The recommended ICRU values are an arithmetic aver-
age of measurements published by a number of authors
before 1971, using diﬀerent energies and methodologies,
and the assigned uncertainties were chosen to embrace
most of the available results. The results presented here
are based on the latest measurements recommended by
the IAEA report [32]. The diﬀerence between the de-
rived asymptotic W-value and the corresponding ICRU
recommended value is assigned as a systematic uncer-
tainty in the quenching factor estimate.

for N2. Only the data from Ref. [41] was used for CO2. The curves are ﬁtted using Eq. 7 to estimate the
asymptotic W-value (Wa) for each gas.

The W-values for protons and heavier ions in the
aforementioned gases were taken from various sources.
Speciﬁcally, Chemtob et al. [43] and Phipps et al. [44]
were used for the W-values of protons, H+

and Ar+ in Ar gas; Huber et al. [45], Boring et al. [46],
Nguyen et al. [47], Waibel et al. [48] for protons, H+

et al. [47] and Waibel et al. [48] for protons, H+

and C+ in CH4 gas; Willems et al. [49], and Posny
et al. [50] for protons, He+ and C+ in C3H8 gas; Gross-
welt et al. [51] for protons in H2 gas. The W-value for
electrons and ions in the gases studied are shown in
Fig. 3. In the case of molecular ions the energy men-
tioned is per atom. In the case of proton and H2 curves,
it is observed that they, practically, coincide. This is ex-
plained by the molecules in the ion beam dissociating
in the initial collisions with the gas constituents [45].

B. Results

The quenching factor for each ion species in a gas was
estimated by dividing Wa in that gas by the W-value of
an ion species, as per Eq. 10. The results are displayed
in Fig. 5. The uncertainties were calculated using the
uncertainty in the estimation of the Wa for electrons
and the uncertainty for the W-values for ions provided
in the respective publications. Where possible, the data
were ﬁt with a functional form inspired by Lindhard
et al.:

qf (E) =

Eα
β + Eα ,

(11)

where α, β are free parameters. The data for diﬀerent
molecules of an atom are combined in the ﬁt. For ref-
erence, the estimated W-values for each ion species are
presented along with the W-value provided by SRIM.

In Fig. 4 the diﬀerence between the measured elec-
tron W-value to the corresponding asymptotic value,
normalised to the latter, is shown.

pends on the incoming particle species and kinetic en-

range, up to the formation of electronic bands at ele-
vated densities, for example at around 10 bar in the case
of Xe [52, 53]. This allows for W -values and quench-
ing factors for gases to be estimated with speciﬁcally
designed experiments, and then be applied to other ex-
perimental conﬁgurations in a wide range of densities.
The method presented is based on this principle, util-
ising dedicated W -value measurements to estimate the
quenching factor in pure gases.

A. Energy dependence of the quenching factor

The results display the expected energy dependence
of the quenching factor which is a consequence of the
energy dependence of the W -value for ions. For elec-
trons with high kinetic energy, typically above a few
keV, the W -value is approximately constant, approach-
ing the asymptotic value. However, for decreasing ki-
netic energy, the electron W -value exhibits a strong en-
ergy dependence, which introduces an eﬀective electron
ionisation quenching. This additional reduction in ion-
isation has to be taken into account when converting
between nuclear recoil energies and electron equivalent
energies. In order to accurately determine the electron
equivalent energy of the ion, the energy dependent elec-

tron W-value should be taken into account. The diﬀer-
ence between Wa and the measured W-value for elec-
trons in various gases is shown in Fig. 4. At an energy
of 500 eV there is approximately a 2 − 8% diﬀerence be-
tween the two, which increases with decreasing energy.

As an example the case of N+

tailed discussion can be found in Ref. [55]. The charge

tral H and a N+

B. Proton quenching factor greater than unity

The W-value for high energy protons, O(MeV) ki-
netic energy, in any gas is in general larger than or
equal to the one for electrons in the same gas [31]. How-
ever, in Fig. 5 the quenching factor for protons in H2,
Ar, N2, and CO2 is found to be greater than unity in
some energies. This counter intuitive eﬀect is a result
of the minimum in the proton W-value curve which is
observed in those gases, and can be seen in Fig. 3. This
is attributed to charge exchange reactions involving H
and the molecule (atom) of the gas [47, 54]. These re-
actions are dominant in the energy range around the
minimum. Although commonly referred to as the ioni-
sation quenching factor, a more appropriate term would
be ‘ionisation yield’, similar to the term ‘scintillation
yield’ used in scintillation detectors.

The H atom can go through the N2 excitation reaction

before ending the cycle by the ionisation reaction in
Eq. 15. This cycle converts an initially pure proton
beam into a mixture of H+ and H, where the latter
dominates for energies above approximately 10 keV. At
low energies, the channels of N2 ionisation and excita-
tion compete almost equally. The addition of secondary

the charge exchange channel shuts oﬀ and results in a
rise of the W-value, which is lowered again near the
MeV-scale due to an increase of proton induced ioni-
sation. The range at which this eﬀect is dominant is
observed to be gas dependent.

C. Comparison with predictions from SRIM

In Fig. 5 the estimated quenching factor curves are
compared with quenching factor from SRIM calcula-
tions. The level of agreement with SRIM varies and
depends on ion type, energy range and gas. SRIM pre-
dictions seem to be in reasonable agreement with results
for N+ in N2, C+ and O+ in CO2 over 10 keV. SRIM
predictions are also comparable to the results for He+
in N2, CO2, Ar, as well as Ar+ in Ar over 10 keV. Below
10 keV SRIM predictions are consistently higher than
the estimated quenching factors. This eﬀect may be at-
tributed to the overestimation of the electronic stopping
power in low energies by SRIM [56].

Two further points of disagreement between SRIM
and the experimental results involve protons in all gases,
except organic molecular gases, and all ion types in or-
ganic molecular gases. In the case of protons in H2, Ar,
N2, and CO2 the discrepancy originates from the charge
exchange cycle, discussed in section IV B, resulting in
additional ionisation with respect to the electronic stop-
ping power estimated by SRIM. In hydrocarbons, as
shown in Fig. 6, the order of quenching factors is in-
verted with respect to what would be anticipated by
molecular mass arguments. For example, as predicted
also by SRIM, ions in CO2 would be expected to have a
lower quenching factor than in CH4 or C3H8. This be-
haviour has been previously reported [30], but its source
remains unclear.

D. Extension to other gases and gas mixtures

The presented measurements were performed using
precision experiments in the context of medical physics
and dosimetry. As such, the gases studied in the liter-
ature are those with particular relevance to that ﬁeld.
However, the same measurement methods can be em-
ployed to study any gas of interest, particularly because
the W -value measurements generally employ ionisation
detectors. The method presented in this work can be
applied to W -value measurements in other gases as they
become available. Gases of particular importance are
noble gases and molecular gases, such as CF4, CH4 and
C4H10, as well as their mixtures. These are of inter-
est to DM search experiments such as those mentioned

in the introduction. Through dedicated measurements,
the W -value could be extended to lower kinetic energies
to better cover the region of interest for DM searches.

V. SUMMARY

Ionisation quenching is a crucial eﬀect on the mea-
surement of low energy ions in a number of applications,
including direct DM searches. Due to the scarcity of
measurements in relevant materials and energy ranges,
one often has to rely on simulations, theoretical mod-
els, or extrapolation of measurements, leading to large
uncertainties.

In this article, a distinction between the several def-
initions of the quenching factor found in literature is
made, the importance of the increased electron W-value
for low kinetic energies is highlighted, and estimates of
the ionisation quenching factor for protons, α-particles,
and heavier ions are presented using measurements of
their W-values and W-values of electrons in H2, CH4,
Ar, N2, CO2, and C3H8 gases. The obtained quench-
ing factor estimates are discussed in terms of ion species
and kinetic energy in a given gas, along with gas-speciﬁc
eﬀects, for example additional ionisation induced by
charge exchange reaction cycles. The data are ﬁt with a
functional form inspired by Lindhard et al., however, no
extrapolation to lower energies has been attempted. In
the future, dedicated measurements will provide better
coverage of the region of interest for DM searches, thus
reducing a major systematic uncertainty for these ex-

periments. Moreover, comparisons with simulations are
included, where such eﬀects are not currently included
for the calculation of the electronic stopping power.

then be compared to phenomenological and theoretical
models to provide a tool for estimating the quenching
factor.

The presented method uses data from dedicated high-
precision experiments and is directly applicable to any
other gas for which W-value measurements become
available. Since the quenching factor is an intrinsic
property of a given gas, obtained estimates may be ap-
plied to any measurement using said gas. In the future,
dedicated measurements can be performed using similar
experimental set-ups to explore the lowest energy ranges
and other pure gases and mixtures. These data could
