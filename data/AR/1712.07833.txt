Abstract An alternative parameter RJz is introduced as the ratio of one of two kinds
of opposite-sign current to the total current and investigate the relationship between the
quantity and the hemispheric sign rule of helicity (HSR) that is established by a series
of previous statistical studies. The classiﬁcation of current in each hemisphere is accord-
ing to the following rule: If the product of the current and the corresponding longitudi-
nal ﬁeld component contributes a consistent sign with reference to the HSR, it is called
“HSR-compliant” current, or else it is called “HSR-noncompliant” current. Firstly, the
consistence between the butterﬂy diagram of the RJz and the current helicity was ob-
tained in a statistical study. Active regions with RJz smaller than 0.5 tend to obey the
HSR whereas those with RJz greater than 0.5 tend to disobey the HSR. The “HSR-
compliant” current systems have 60% probability of realization compared to 40% of
“HSR-noncompliant” current systems. Overall, the HSR is violated for active regions
in which the “HSR-noncompliant” current is greater than the “HSR-compliant” current.
Secondly, the RJz parameter was subsequently used to study the evolution of current sys-
tems in the case analyses of ﬂare-productive active regions NOAA AR 11158 and 11283.
It is found that there were “RJz -quasi-stationary” phase that is relatively ﬂare quiescent
and “RJz -dynamic” phase that is covered by the occurrence of large ﬂares.

1 INTRODUCTION

The chirality of active region magnetic ﬁelds has been studied in terms of the current helicity or the
linear force-free ﬁeld α. In the northern (southern) solar hemisphere, there is statistically negative (pos-
itive) sign preference of helicity quantities; this trend is called the hemispheric helicity sign rule (HSR
hereafter in this paper; see Seehafer, 1990; Pevtsov et al., 1994, 1995; Abramenko, Wang & Yurchishin,
1996; Bao & Zhang, 1998; Hagino & Sakurai, 2004; Tiwari et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010, for results
based on the data before solar cycle 24). To be related closely, some case analyses showed that there
were opposite electric current systems in several active regions (Wang, Xu & Zhang, 1994; Leka et al.,
1996; Wang & Abramenko, 1999; Wheatland, 2000). This implies that both left and right handedness
of ﬁeld coexist in active regions, as have been also supported by the observation of Su et al. (2009), an
α map may contain mixed signs in sunspots. In addition, the statistical study of helicity sign was carried
out in the solar minimum (e.g., Hao & Zhang, 2012). Recently, the HSR has been further conﬁrmed
with the studies on helicity injection from emerging active regions (Yang et al., 2009; Zhang & Yang,
2013) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observation

by Liu et al. (2014). These studies have shown that the HSR has large dispersion; the ratio of preferred
helicity sign is about 60%.

On the other hand, some results showed that the HSR might not hold throughout the so-
lar cycle (Bao, Ai & Zhang, 2000; Hagino & Sakurai, 2005; Zhang et al., 2010). This observa-
tional characteristic was obviously important for the theoretical formulation of dynamo models
(Choudhuri, Chatterjee & Nandy, 2004; Pipin et al., 2013). It has been further conﬁrmed that there were
net current above both polarities of magnetic ﬁeld in several active regions (Gao, 2013).

The study has indicated that the HSR can also be investigated in term of electric current distributions
in active regions. Corresponding to the locus of sign reversal of helicity found in the helicity butterﬂy
diagram by Zhang et al. (2010), there is also reversal of sign of net electric currents in the butterﬂy
diagram (Gao, 2013). On the other hand, the contribution of opposite-sign helical ﬁelds to the ﬁlament
eruptions has been observed by (Liu & Kurokawa, 2004; Shen et al., 2015). Bi et al. (2016) found that
the reversal direction of a sunspots rotation during an X1.6 ﬂare. As a result, we speculate that the
currents which do not conform to the HSR have its own signiﬁcance and it is important to investigate
their properties in broader viewpoint of observation.

In this paper a new quantity RJz is introduced; in a given active region it quantiﬁes the ratio of the
currents that do not obey the HSR to the total currents. First, the solar-cycle evolution of RJz will be
studied and used to interpret the distribution of the helicity in the butterﬂy diagram in Section 2 from
the viewpoint of dynamic evolution of two kinds of electric current. In Section 3, using RJz , it was
further investigated of the evolution of current systems above opposite polarities in two active regions
that produced large ﬂares.

2 DATA OBSERVED AT HUAIROU SOLAR OBSERVING STATION

2.1 Deﬁnition of Parameters

Our starting point is the well-known deﬁnition of the electric current:

Jz = (1/µ0)(∂By/∂x − ∂Bx/∂y)
where µ0 = 4π × 10−3 G m A−1. We deﬁne the ratio of the currents:

R

±
Jz = −

Pi Jzi
Pj Jzj − Pi Jzi

(1)

(2)

where “i” (“j”) denote the pixels that have sign of the current helicity Hc = Bz · Jz that is inconsis-
tent (consistent) with the sign of the current helicity according to the HSR. If θ is the latitude of a region
under consideration, then “i” pixels are in regions with θBzJz > 0 where “j” pixels are θBzJz < 0.
According to the HSR, “i” represents the “HSR-noncompliant” current system and “j” represents the
“HSR-compliant” current system. The superscript ± means that RJz is computed in regions of positive
(+) or negative (−) magnetic polarity, respectively. In either positive or negative polarity regions, Jzi
and Jzj have opposite signs, and RJz is always positive and between 0 and 1. The parameter RJz repre-
sents the fraction of “HSR-noncompliant” currents normalized by the total currents. Likewise, 1 − RJz
represents the fraction of “HSR-compliant” currents and the difference between the two is 1−2RJz. The
latter quantity might be compared with the helicity imbalance parameter ρh introduced by Bao & Zhang
(1998) if we consider the current helicity instead of the current itself.

If RJz is deﬁned as a fraction of pixels with consistent sign of Hc, it will be equivalent to 1−RJz . In
my case of deﬁnition, the value of RJz in each HSR-compliant region tends to be less than 50%, and that
in each HSR-noncompliant region tends to be greater than 50%. The distribution of electric current with
the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld affects the ultimate determination of sign of hHci in an active region, as
shown in Figures 2 (b) and (c) later. This deﬁnition is concerned with the physical scenario of observed
opposite-sign current in the magnetogram. How to understand the current which does not conform to
the HSR is still an open question. In this paper, the signiﬁcance of the Hc-noncompliant current in the

A Quantity Characterising Magnetic Twist

observation is in agreement with the fact that the HSR rule has a dispersion presently restricted only
to 60% of ARs. That is to say, the variation of Hc-compliant and Hc-noncompliant current system is
probably more intrinsic property of evolution of twist in solar active regions.

To further declare the quantity of RJz and understand its relation with the current helicity, it was
used of the current helicity butterﬂy diagram with HSOS vector magnetograms over two solar magnetic
cycles (Zhang et al., 2010). However, when we study the evolution of RJz in individual active region,
the high-cadence vector magnetograms observed by the spatial instrument as SDO/HMI are necessary.

2.2 Connection of RJz to Previous Statistical Observation

The vector magnetograms used here have been obtained with the Solar Magnetic Field Telescope
(SMFT) of Huairou Solar Observing Station, National Astronomical Observatories of China. The basic
information of the instrument can be referred to Bao & Zhang (1998). Following Zhang et al. (2010), in
computations of the current helicity, the pixels with signal that exceeds the noise levels (|Bz| > 20 G
and Bt >100 G) were used.

Gao (2013) has shown that the net electric currents follow a butterﬂy-diagram-like evolution over
the solar cycle. The analysis of 6629 vector magnetograms observed at Huairou Solar Observing Station
from 1988 to 2005 has revealed that RJz also shows a butterﬂy diagram (see Figures 1 and 2). Detailed
information about the data used for the production of Figures 1 is given in Zhang et al. (2010). In Figure
1, the color background represents the values of R+
(Figure 1b). These values have
Jz
been averaged over the same intervals in time and latitude as the current helicity. The overplotted ﬁlled
or open circles are the averaged current helicity hHci from the same data sample. The sizes of open and
ﬁlled circles in Figure 1 are different from Zhang et al. (2010) because a different way of display was
adopted. The size of open or ﬁlled circles is scaled by using the ratio of the value in each bin to the
maximum of absolute value that can be seen from the label. Meanwhile, the square root value for each
bin was adopt so that the sizes of open and ﬁlled circles can be visually comparable. From the ﬁgure,
we can see:

is shown in Figure 3(a) with a linear correlation coefﬁcient of 0.52. This value is highly signiﬁcant
since the level of 99% signiﬁcance for the two-tailed test for 100 degrees of freedom is 0.254,
while the total number of the studied active regions is 983. Both average values of RJz on the two
polarities are around 0.48.

and R

2. The color of the background for RJz in Figure 1 tends to be green RJz < 0.5 in accordance with
the overplotted ﬁlled circles in the north hemisphere and open circles in the south hemisphere. On
the contrary, the color of the background tends to blue RJz > 0.5 in accordance with the sizes of
overplotted open circles in the north hemisphere and ﬁlled circles in the south hemisphere. That is
to say, regions with the RJz less (greater) than 0.5 tends to obey (disobey) the HSR.

3. The sign reversal of helicity tends to occur where the fraction of “HSR-noncompliant” current
systems is greater than 0.5, manifested in blue colors in Figure 1. The two boxes in black in Figure
1 show a typical example. For more quantitative analyses, we use the sign function of latitude, and
consider the quantity sign (θ) · hHci. If the helicity obeys/disobeys the HSR, sign (θ) · hHci will be
negative/positive. Thus we expect that the RJz is positively correlated with sign (θ) · hHci. Figures
2(b) and 2(c) show that this is really the case. The well correlation between the magnitude of the
RJz and hHci indicates the sign of hHci reﬂects the chirality of ﬁeld than the ﬁeld strength.

4. We computed the percentage of active region numbers in each quadrant of Figures 2(b) and 2(c),
and found that they are 30.6% (ﬁrst quadrant), 10.4% (second quadrant), 49.1% (third quadrant) and
9.8% (fourth quadrant), respectively, in Figure 2(b), The active regions in the second and third quad-
rants obey the HSR, which are in total 59.5%. Figure 2(c) shows similar number; the percentages of
active regions in four quadrants are 29.1%, 11.4%, 48.1% and 11.4%, respectively, and again 59.5%
of active regions follow the HSR. The ﬁrst quadrant shows that the RJz and hHci both disobey the
HSR, while the third quadrant shows that the RJz and hHci both obey the HSR. The percentages are

4

Y. Gao

around 30% for the ﬁrst quadrant and 50% for the third quadrant. Particularly, the second quadrant
shows that the RJz disobeys the HSR but the hHci obeys that the HSR, on the contrary, the fourth
quadrant shows that the RJz obeys the HSR but the hHci disobeys the HSR. The percentages in
the second and fourth quadrant are around 10%. These two parts imply the distribution of electric
current with the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld affects the ultimate determination of sign of hHci in an
active region.

5. Statistically, when RJz is less (greater) than 0.5, the active region obeys (disobeys) the HSR. As an
active region evolves the current systems evolve as well, and the “HSR-compliant” current systems
may become smaller than the “HSR-noncompliant” one so that the active region disobeys the HSR,
and vice versa. However, over the whole solar activity cycle, in 60% of the active regions the “HSR-
compliant” current system is greater than the “HSR-noncompliant” one, hence accounting for the
HSR. So from the viewpoint of two current system of opposite sign coexisting in the same magnetic
polarity, it can also account for the hemispheric sign rule of helicity.

3 CASE STUDY USING THE DATA FROM SDO/HMI

3.1 Detailed Analyses on Two Active Regions

The new generation vector magnetograph SDO/HMI provides more stable time-series than ground-based
ones and allow us to study whether there is the relative variation of current system of solar magnetic
ﬁeld with time. If the RJz reveals the variation of real chirality of magnetic ﬁeld, it is expected to see the
evolution of two kinds of current systems. To this end, we studied two ﬂare-productive active regions
using vector magnetograms obtained with SDO/HMI ﬁrstly.

HMI’s basic information can be referred to Schou et al. (2012). It contains a full disk (4096 × 4096)
ﬁltergraph with a pixel resolution of 0.5 arcsec.The working spectral line is Fe I 617.3 nm line through
a 76 m ˚A passband ﬁlter at six wavelength positions across the line. The processing of vector magnetic
ﬁeld by using the Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector algorithm based on the Milne-Eddington
atmospheric model can be referred in Hoeksema et al. (2014). The 180◦ ambiguity of horizontal ﬁeld
was resolved with the minimum energy method (Leka et al. 2009).

3.2 Electric Currents in NOAA 11158 and 11283

Figure 3(b) shows the total electric currents in NOAA 11158. This region was located in the south-
ern hemisphere. The net currents can be measured by the difference between the curves of the “HSR-
compliant” and “HSR-noncompliant” current in Figure 3(b). The total net current P(J +
zi ) above
the positive (negative) is positive (negative). Therefore, AR11158 obeyed the HSR.

zj + J +

Figure 4(b) shows the evolution of total electric currents in NOAA 11283. This region was located
in the northern hemisphere. If it obeys the HSR, it should have negative helicity. From Figure 4(b), we
can see that the net currents were positive in the negative polarity and negative in the positive polarity,
i.e. negative helicity, before September 5. The signs of the currents changed after September 5, leading
to positive helicity, against the HSR. This is consistent with the results obtained by Gao, Zhao & Zhang
(2012).

The opposite signs of net electric current above opposite magnetic polarity in Figure 3(c) and 4(c)
agree with the results obtained by (Gao, 2013). Furthermore, they indicate signiﬁcant changes in the
current systems during the evolution of the regions; the net currents above regions of opposite magnetic
polarities show variations in almost precisely the opposite sense, indicating a closure of current systems

ﬂowing between the two polarities. The unit of electric current density was used for ΣJz and hJzi, that
stand for the integrated and averaged magnitude of electric current density over all of selected pixels.
The main difference with the unit of electric current applied in some other analyses (e.g., Vemareddy,
Venkatakrishnan and Karthikreddy, 2015; Vemareddy, Cheng and Ravindra, 2016) is the factor of the
area of each pixel, 2.54 × 1011m2 for these two sets of HMI vector magnetograms with spatial resolution
of 0.504

per pixel.

3.3 RJz in NOAA 11158 and 11283

Figure 3(d) shows the evolution of RJz in NOAA AR 11158. The corresponding error is estimated with
the method of Monte Carlo simulation. By adding a random noise that is less than that recorded error
of each measured vector magnetic ﬁeld, then we repeat the computation many times and get the ﬁnal
average value and the corresponding standard deviation. During the time interval we studied, the value
of R+
(red) increased from a minimum of 0.431 at 09:24 UT on February 13 (some 8.06 h before the
Jz
ﬁrst M6.6 ﬂare) to a maximum of 0.490 at 18:00 UT on February 14 and then decreased to 0.449 at 15:36
UT on February 15 (some 14 h after the X2.2-class ﬂare). The evolution of R
(blue) shows similar
characteristics. The linear correlation coefﬁcient between R+
is 0.85. Such a high correlation

of this region.

Figure 4(d) shows the evolution of the RJz in NOAA AR 11283. During the time interval we

then decreased to reach 0.513 at 11:48 UT on September 08 again (about 12 h after the X1.8 ﬂare). The
subsequent evolution of RJz is not known because no vector magnetograms were available. The time
proﬁles of the R+
are similar; the linear correlation coefﬁcient between the two quantities is

The above results may indicate that the time variation in RJz can be used to identify an “RJz -
dynamic” phase. Therefore, we divide the studied periods into two intervals: “RJz -quasi-stationary” and
“RJz -dynamic” phases. The start of the “RJz -dynamic” phase is taken at the time when RJz begins to
rise to a global maximum. The end of the “RJz -dynamic” phase is taken as the time when RJz returned
to a local minimum. Hence the “RJz -quasi-stationary” phase is the time outside of the “RJz -dynamic”
phase. In particular, for AR11158 and AR11283 the “RJz -dynamic” phases are the intervals between
the vertical dashed lines in Figures 3(c) and 4(c), respectively: for AR11158 the “RJz -dynamic” phase
was from 09:24 UT on February 13 to 15:36 UT on February 15 and for AR11283 it was from 21:36 UT
on September 04 to 11:48 UT on September 8. Interestingly, the behavior of RJz in the “RJz -dynamic”
phase was similar in the two analyzed active regions.

In order to see where such variations in the electric currents take place, eight moments were chosen
and marked with arrows in Figures 3(d) and 4(d), and plotted the corresponding snapshots of the electric
currents. The “P” and “Q” regions in panels (a-h) of Figures 5 and 6 show the regions in which prominent
variation of HSR-noncompliant current occurred. Here the prominent variation of current are shown with
“P” and “Q” regions, but it does not mean the variation only occurs at these regions but must exist in
other places that are not clearly shown. At least in the region of opposite magnetic polarity, there is
corresponding well correlated variation of current. This can be inferred from the Figure 3 (d) and 4 (d).
Compared with the evolutional trends of other parameters for AR 11158 (e.g., Song et al. 2013),
such as electric current, current helicity, photospheric free energy, and angular shear etc., the curve RJz
has a similar rising trend in the former half of “RJz -dynamic” phase. However, there is an obviously dif-
ferent descending trend in the latter half of “RJz -dynamic” phase. After the “RJz -dynamic” phase, the
RJz returns to the level as that before the “RJz -dynamic” phase. The decreasing tendency of parameter
measuring the free magnetic energy would be expected after the ﬂare, as pointed out by (Wiegelmann,
Thalmann and Solanki, 2014). Although there are different trend in some particular situations, these
parameters are all important to show the storage and release of magnetic energy in different ways.

When the computation was performed, the pixels where |Bz| ≥ 50G are taken into the ﬁnal deter-
mination of the parameters so that the uncertainty of horizontal and vertical ﬁeld outside of the active
region would affect little these parameters. To the evolutional curves of AR 11158 and 11283, the error
propagation was estimated by Monte Carlo method. In particular, 30 sets of parameter were obtained
at each moment by adding the random errors to the inputted ﬁeld strength. Take Jz for example, ﬁrstly
the Jz with account of random error is computed as follows: Jz = (1/µ0){∂[By + 2 × (R0 − 0.5) ×
δBy]/∂x − ∂[Bx + 2 × (R1 − 0.5) × δBx]/∂y}, where R0 and R1 are random number units. δBx and
δBy are inversion errors of ﬁeld components provided by HMI. Then the standard deviation of these
30 sets of parameter (δJz ) is taken as the error estimation of this moment. The error at each moment is
shown with short bar of the corresponding quantity in (b), (c) and (d) of Figure 3 and 4.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Conclusions

From long-term observation obtained at the Huairou Solar Observing Station that covered more than 1.5
solar cycles, two current systems can be identiﬁed: they were named as “HSR-compliant” and “HSR-
noncompliant” current systems according to whether their signs conform to the HSR. It was found
that the active regions with RJz less than 0.5 tend to obey the HSR while active regions with RJz
greater than 0.5 tend to disobey the “HSR”. It was also found that the “HSR-compliant” current system
has about 60% probability of realization greater than the “HSR-noncompliant” current system. This
marginal superiority of the normal current system may explain the reversal of the helicity sign and big
scatter in the HSR. At present it was uncertain whether the above picture holds for any given time. From
the locus of sign reversal of helicity in Figures 1, it is inferred that the probability of “HSR-compliant”
vs. “HSR-noncompliant” current systems may be different for different active regions or in different
phases of the solar cycle.

Active regions studied here exhibited an “RJz -dynamic” phase in the time proﬁles of their RJz .
The “RJz -dynamic” phase is the interval characterized by the gradual increase and then decrease in
RJz on both polarities. In the studied active regions, large ﬂares occurred during this interval. Eight
moments were chosen that marked in Figure 3 and 4, then the corresponding snapshot of the electric
current was plotted. The green arrows in panels (a-h) of Figure 5 and 6 indicate the regions of prominent
variation and with the abnormal helicity. This shows a prominent increase and then decrease in one of
the current systems in the “RJz -dynamic” phase, violating the HSR for the two particular active regions
in this study. This conjecture still needs further conﬁrmation by a statistical work with a bigger sample.
However, RJz could be a sensitive indicator highlighting peculiar properties of active regions around
large ﬂares compared to their properties in relatively quiescent periods. It was noted that in the two active
regions, their long-term evolution of RJz that deﬁned their “RJz -dynamic” was similar. This might
indicate that RJz reﬂects the underlying physical process that occurs commonly in current systems of
different active regions around the time of large ﬂares.

The high correlation coefﬁcient between the time proﬁles of RJz that are associated with opposite
magnetic polarities was also found in AR11158 and AR11283. It implies that the current systems in the
opposite polarities evolve coherently, namely the currents connect the two polarities by ﬂowing basically
along the ﬁeld lines.

4.2 Discussion

The RJz parameter measures the difference in magnitudes of two opposite current systems which ac-
counts for whether the active region obeys HSR or not. Besides, it shows large-scale temporal trends
associated with the occurrence of large ﬂares for the two different active regions studied. This property
may be applied to further study ﬂares in different active regions, though it needs to be stressed again
that a statistical work with more examples is needed to conﬁrm the universality of the RJz -dynamic

phase covering the major ﬂare. Besides, how to quantitatively separate the RJz -quasi-stationary from
the RJz -dynamic phase needs further investigation.

It should be pointed out that the dynamic evolution of electric current in the solar active region
investigated in the current paper is based on the observation in space. The time-series of vector magne-
togram are obtained with high cadence and snapshots show the evolution of active region independent
with the atmosphere around the earth. Up to now, the SDO/HMI instrument provides the unique data for
this investigation. Even for this instrument, it was uncertain for how many observed active region we
can see the similar variation. This is to present an alternative quantity that possibly reﬂects the dynamic
evolution of two kinds of opposite magnetic twist in individual polarity longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld by
analyzing two well-observed active regions.

Fig. 1 (a) Butterﬂy diagrams of RJz (colors) associated with averaged current helicity hHci
(open and ﬁlled circles). The vertical axis gives the latitude and the horizontal axis gives the
time in years. The values of RJz are scaled according to the color square that appears to the
right of the panel. The sizes of open/ﬁlled circles correspond to the magnitude of the hHci
according to the scale that appears under the horizontal axis labels. (b) The same as panel (a)
but for RJz associated with negative magnetic ﬁelds. Butterﬂy diagrams of hHci was plotted
in agreement to that from Zhang et al. (2010) by keeping the same requirement of at least
30 data samples in each latitude-time bin. However, this requirement was released to if only
there are 2 data samples in each latitude-time bin for plotting butterﬂy diagrams of RJz so
that the reversal-sign features on the edges can be shown.
