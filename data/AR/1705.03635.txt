Abstract 

AlGaN plays a vital role in hetero-structure high electron mobility transistor by employing a two-dimensional electron 

gas and as electron blocking layer in the multi quantum well light emitting diodes. Nevertheless, the incorporation of 

Al in GaN for the formation of AlGaN alloy is limited by  the diffusion barrier formed by instant nitridation of Al 

adatoms by reactive atomic N. Incorporation of Al above the miscibility limit, however can be achieved by ion beam 

technique.  The well known ion beam  mixing (IBM) technique  was carried out  with the  help of  Ar+ irradiation  for 

different fluences. A novel approach was also adopted for the synthesis of AlGaN by the process of post irradiation 

diffusion  (PID)  as  a  comparative  study  with  the  IBM  technique.  The  optical  investigations  of  AlGaN  nanowires, 

synthesized via two different methods of ion beam processing are reported. The effect of irradiation fluence and post 

irradiation  annealing  temperature  on  the  random  alloy  formation  were  studied  by  the  vibrational  and 

photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic studies. Vibrational studies show one-mode phonon behavior corresponding 

to longitudinal optical (LO) mode of A1 symmetry (A1(LO)) for the wurtzite phase of AlGaN nanowires in the random 

alloy model. Maximum Al atomic percentage ~6.3-6.7% was calculated with the help of band bowing formalism from 

the Raman spectral analysis for samples synthesized in IBM and PID processes. PL studies show the extent of defects 

present in these samples.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Group  III  nitrides  and  its  ternary  alloys  with  direct  band  gap  find  tremendous  attention  in  the  scientific 

community as well as the optoelectronic industry for its applications of light emitting diodes (LED) and laser diodes.1 

Among them, AlGaN based LEDs serve as a tunable source in the region of ultra-violet (UV) to deep UV (3.4-6.2 eV) 

by varying the Al percentage.2 The deep UV LEDs find potential application in air and water purification, biomedical 

treatment, high resolution display and optical data storage.3-5 Generally, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the 

optoelectronic  devices  is  very  low  due  to  high  leakage  current  in  InGaN/GaN  based  blue  LEDs.  The  IQE  can  be 

increased to a significant extent by using AlGaN as an electron blocking layer in the multi quantum well (MQW) 

LEDs.6 Moreover, AlGaN plays a vital role in hetero-structure high electron mobility transistor by employing a two-

dimensional electron gas induced at the hetero-interface as a highly conducting channel.7  

The synthesis of AlGaN with the desired percentage of Al, however is difficult due to the following reasons. 

During the growth process, highly reactive atomic N reacts instantly with Al adatoms and limits the further diffusion 

of  the  adatoms  to  form  AlGaN  with  a  higher  atomic  percentage  of  Al.8  Furthermore,  incorporation  of  oxygen  is 

promoted due to the  high chemical affinity of  Al towards  oxygen and  hence  it suppresses the  growth of  AlGaN. 9 

Especially, in the commercially viable technique of chemical vapour deposition (CVD), it is very difficult to achieve 

high quality AlGaN with a higher percentage (>10%) of Al, because of the miscibility limit and the requirement of 

very high temperature (>1100 oC) for the formation of Ga and Al eutectic alloy in the catalyst assisted vapor-liquid-

solid (VLS) process.10 In this context we may like to mention that achieving Al content >3 at% in AlGaN nanostructure 

using  thermodynamic  processes  is  very  difficult  pertaining  to  the  high  value  of  defect  formation  energy  in 

nanostructures while incorporation of Al in the lattice of GaN nanostructures.11 The above mentioned difficulties can 

be tackled up to a certain extent by adopting the well known ion beam mixing (IBM) techniques, useful for alloy 

formation above the miscibility limit and can be employed to thermodynamically immiscible systems, as well.12 In 

comparison to the direct implantation, IBM results in a very uniform composition throughout the depth of penetration 

of the irradiation ion. Defect creation and simultaneous diffusion of elemental species are anticipated to form alloy 

with higher incorporation percentage than the conventional process.  Furthermore, IBM is a versatile technique for 

multi layer formation in metallic and semiconductor systems.13 

In  this  present  study,  we  used  the  IBM  technique  for  the  synthesis  of  AlGaN  nanowires  (NWs).  A  new 

approach  was  also  adopted  for  the  synthesis  of  AlGaN  by  the  process  of  post  irradiation  diffusion  (PID),  with  a 

motivation for the enhancement of the Al diffusion into GaN due to the production of native defects by the irradiation 

2 

 
of high energy ions. Raman spectroscopic study was performed to investigate the vibrational properties and to estimate 

the Al percentage in the alloy formation. Variation of Al percentage with the irradiation fluence and post irradiation 

annealing temperature was estimated in both the IBM and the PID processes. Defect creation and subsequent diffusion 

of  elemental  species  in  the  later  case,  may  help  in  forming  alloy  with  higher  incorporation  percentage  than  the 

conventional one. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopic study was carried out for understanding the defects present 

in AlGaN synthesized via the IBM and the PID processes.  

II. EXPERIMENTAL 

A. Synthesis 

AlGaN NWs were synthesized by two processes, namely IBM and PID techniques using GaN NWs grown 

by  atmospheric  pressure  CVD  (APCVD)  technique  in  the  catalyst  assisted  vapor-liquid-solid  (VLS)  process.  Au 

catalyst  was  deposited  on  the  crystalline  Si(100)  substrates  using  thermal  evaporation  technique  (12A4D, 

HINDHIVAC,  India).  The  Au  coated  substrates  were  annealed  at  a  temperature  of  900  oC  for  10  min  in  an  inert 

atmosphere for preparing the Au nanoparticles (NPs). Ga metal (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) as precursor, NH 3 (5 N pure) 

as reactant and N2 (5 N pure) as carrier gases were used for the growth process. The Si(100) substrate with Au NPs 

was kept upstream of a Ga droplet in a high pure alumina boat (99.95%), placed inside a quartz tube. The temperature 

of the quartz tube was raised to the optimized growth temperature of 900  oC with a ramp rate of 15 oC per min. The 

growth process was carried out by using NH3 (10 sccm) diluted with N2 (20 sccm) as carrier gas for a duration of 3 h. 

In IBM process, Ar+ ion was chosen because of its inert nature and to maximize the nuclear energy loss in Al layer. 

The required thickness of Al layer was calculated as ~25 nm with the help of  stopping and range of ions in matter 

(SRIM) analysis for the Ar+ irradiation with energy of 25 keV. The distribution of the Ar+ in Al/GaN is available in 

the supplementary material (Fig. S1). Al layer (~25 nm) was coated on as-grown GaN NWs using the same thermal 

evaporation technique. Al/GaN was irradiated with Ar+ (25 keV) at fluences of 1E16 and 5E16 ions·cm-2. The in-situ 

monitoring of fluence for the ion beam was carried out with the help of a Faraday cup. Two separate irradiated samples 

were selected for annealing process at 900 and 1000 oC in N2 (5N pure) atmosphere for 5 min. On the other hand, for 

the PID process, prior to the coating of Al (~25 nm thick), the GaN NWs were irradiated with Ar+ ion keeping the 

energy and fluences of the Ar+ same as in case of IBM process. Similarly, the samples were also annealed with the 

above mentioned conditions as a final step. 

3 

 
 
 
B. Characterizations 

Morphological analysis was carried out after each step using field emission scanning electron microscopy 

(FESEM; Zeiss SUPRA 55). The  vibrational properties were studied in the  backscattering geometry  using Raman 

spectroscopy (inVia, Renishaw, UK) with Ar+ laser excitation of 514.5 nm and 1800 groves·mm−1 grating used as a 

monochromatizer. Resonance Raman and photoluminescence spectra were recorded at room temperature using a UV 

laser of wavelength 325 nm in the same spectrometer. The spectra were collected with a 40× objective and dispersed 

through a grating of 2400 grooves·mm−1. The thermoelectrically cooled charged coupled device (CCD) based detector 

was used for all these studies. 

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

A. The morphological analysis 

The typical FESEM image of as-grown GaN NWs shows [Figs. 1(a(i)) and 1(b(i))] smooth and uniform NWs with an 

average diameter of ~100 nm and length varying from 1-4 µm. Lengths of the NWs were calculated from the plan-

view, and tilt-view FESEM images (not shown in figure) taken at different locations of the sample. A statistic was 

made out by measuring the length of several NWs. The maximum numbers of NWs were about 3 µm long. Al/GaN 

NWs,  synthesized  in  the  IBM  and  the  PID  processes  at  two  different  fluences  of  1E16  and  5E16  ions·cm-2,  after 

annealing  at  1000  oC  are  shown  in  Figure  1(a(ii)),  1(a(iii))  and  1(b(ii)),  1(b(iii))  respectively.  The  corresponding 

FESEM images of the samples annealed at 900 oC is available in the supplementary material (Fig. S2).

processes. Inserts showing the high magnification images of the respective samples.  

The NWs in the samples synthesized via IBM and PID techniques preserve its size, shape and topographic 

nature after the irradiation with high energy ions with a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-2 and subsequent annealing at 1000 

oC, as compared to those for as-grown GaN NWs [Fig. 1(a)]. Similar observations are also made in the case of samples 

irradiated at a higher fluence of 5E16 ions·cm-2 [Fig. 1(b)]. 

B. Vibrational analysis  

In the case of a wurtzite III-nitride, group theory predicts eight sets of phonon normal modes at the Γ-point, 

namely, 2A1 + 2E1 + 2B1 + 2E2. Among them, one set of A1 and E1 symmetry modes are acoustic, while the remaining 

six modes (A1 + E1 + 2B1 + 2E2) are optical in nature. Each one of the A1 and E1 optical modes split into longitudinal 

optical (LO) and transverse optical (TO) modes due to their polar nature of vibration.14-16 The typical Raman spectra 

of as-grown GaN NWs and spectra collected after different steps are shown in the Figure 2 for samples irradiated with 

a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-2 both in the IBM and the PID processes. In the vibrational spectrum of as-grown GaN 

NWs,  the  peaks  centered  ~567  and  ~725  cm-1  correspond  to  the  symmetry  allowed  E2(high)  and  A1(LO)  modes, 

respectively,  for  wurzite  GaN.14-16 Another peak centered  at ~420  cm-1  may correspond to zone  boundary phonon 

5 

 
 
 
modes  arising  due  to  the  finite  crystal  size  of  GaN  NWs.16,17 The  peak  centered  ~520  cm-1  is  originated  from  the 

crystalline Si substrate. In the case of IBM process, after the thin layer deposition of Al, all the Raman modes  are 

found to be quenched [Fig. 2(a)] due the screening of excitation laser by Al metal layer. As a first step in the PID 

process, however, all the modes are also found to disappear [Fig. 2(b)] after the irradiation with Ar+ because of the 

production of large number of point defects leading to the distortion of lattice structure. After the annealing at 900 oC 

in N2 atmosphere, the Raman modes are found to reappear [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)] due to possible partial removal of 

defects in the annealing process. In the case of 1000 oC annealed samples, the peaks could revive to their original line 

shape  with  significant  peak  intensity  [Figs.  2(a)  and  2(b)],  as  compared  to  those  of  the  900  oC  annealed  samples. 

However, it could not revive them completely as compared to that of the as–grown sample. The reason may be because 

of the fact that annealing temperature is not sufficient enough to remove all the point defects created at the time of 

irradiation. Generally, two third of the material melting point temperature (MPT) is required to remove almost all the 

point  defects  created  in  the  irradiation  process  which  is  ~1650  oC  for  GaN  (MPT  ~  2500  oC).18  Moreover,  high 

temperature annealing can also create surface defects, which is significant in nanostructures.18,19 Therefore, further 

annealing at higher temperatures were not carried out in order to avoid the creation of surface defects. In the case of 

post irradiation annealing (900 and 1000 oC) of the sample synthesized in the IBM process, the E2(high) mode exactly 

reappeared  at  the  same  position  (~567  cm-1),  as  compared  that  of  the  of  as-grown  sample  [Fig.  2(a)].  Similar 

observations were also found in the case of the sample prepared in the PID process [Fig. 2(b)]. The Raman spectral 

analysis of the samples synthesized via IBM and PID process with a fluence of 5E16 ions·cm-2 also showed the similar 

characteristics as shown in the supplementary material (Fig. S3).

with a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-2. Vertical dashed line is a guide to eye for the peak position of E2(high) mode. 

 Since, the random alloy formation is expected for the AlGaN;15 hence E2(high) mode corresponding to AlN 

is also likely be observed along with the E2(high) mode of GaN. The absence of E2(high) mode corresponding to AlN 

may be because of the nominal incorporation of Al percentage in GaN, which is not sufficient enough to be probed in 

the usual Raman spectroscopy, as change in the polarizibility is also very minimum in the AlN phase.14 Whereas, the 

A1(LO) mode could not retrieve back the sufficient peak intensity in the Raman spectra even after annealing at 1000 

oC. In order to understand the complete behavior of the  A1(LO)  mode, resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS)  was 

carried out with the help of 325 nm (3.815 eV) excitation laser sources with energy higher than the band gap of GaN 

(3.47 eV at room temperature) invoking Frölich interaction in the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling.20,21 

The typical RRS spectra of the samples irradiated with a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-2 in the IBM and the PID process 

are shown in Figure 3.

FIG.  3.  Typical  resonance  Raman  spectra  of  as-grown  GaN  and  Al/GaN  NWs  in  different  steps  of  the  (a)  IBM  and  (b)  PID 

processes irradiated with a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-2. Vertical dashed line is a guide to eye for the blue shift of A1(LO) mode. 

Along with the 1st order A1(LO) mode, the 2nd order 2A1(LO) mode was also observed in as-grown sample. 

After the irradiation process, all the A1(LO) modes are found to be diminished. In the IBM process, once the sample 

was annealed at 900 oC, the modes are found to reappear with a significant blue shift of A1(LO) mode ~5.9 cm-1 [Fig. 

3(a)]  as  compared  to  that  of  the  as-grown  GaN  NWs.  The  observed  blue  shift  can  be  attributed  to  the  one  mode 

behavior of A1(LO) mode in the random alloy model invoked because of the Al incorporation in the GaN.15 Since, the 

incorporation of a dopant or elements for alloy formation mainly depends on ion energy and irradiation fluence in the 

IBM process;19 the sample annealed at 1000 oC also show the similar blue shift [Fig. 3(a)]. Whereas, in the case of the 

PID process, the incorporation of Al in GaN depends on ion energy, irradiation fluence and annealing temperature, as 

well. In contrast to the IBM process, the driving force involved in the PID process for the migration and incorporation 

of Al in GaN originate from the thermal energy provided by the annealing process. Thus, there is a significant increase 

in blue shift (~2.3 cm-1) observed for A1(LO) mode in the case of 1000 oC annealed sample as compared to that for the 

900 oC annealed sample [Fig. 3(b)]. In the case of PID process, the A1(LO) mode shows a higher blue shift as compared 

to that of the IBM process, indicating possible higher percentage of Al incorporation in 1000  oC annealed sample. 

Similar analysis were also carried out for the samples synthesized with a fluence of 5E16 ions·cm-2 (Fig. S4).

excitation, Fig. 4(a)) and A1(LO) mode observed in RRS (325 nm excitation, Fig. 4(b)) for as-grown and 1000  oC 

annealed samples irradiated with a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-2 in the IBM and the PID process. 

FIG. 4. Lorentzian line shape fitted (a) E2(high) and (b) A1(LO) mode of as-grown and 1000 oC annealed samples irradiated with 

a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-2 in the IBM and the PID processes. Vertical dashed line is a guide to eye for the significant blue shift 

of A1(LO) mode. 

According  to  band  bowing  formalism  of  random  alloy  model  the  percentage  of  Al  incorporation  is  given  by  the 

following equation which is analogous to the Vegard’s law.15   

A1(LO)AlGaN=A1(LO)GaN+[A1(LO)AlN-A1(LO)GaN]x-bx(1-x) .………...…………(1) 

Where, ‘x’ is the Al atomic percentage in AlGaN and ‘b’ is the bowing parameter. For lower percentage of Al, the 

bowing parameter ‘b’ can be neglected. Thus, the atomic percentage of Al in the AlGaN random alloy was found to 

~3.7 % and ~4.6 % in case of the IBM and the PID processes, respectively for the samples irradiated with a fluence 

of 1E16 ions·cm-2. Similarly, the Al percentage was also estimated as ~6.7 and ~6.3 at% for the samples irradiated 

with a fluence of 5E16 ions·cm-2 in the IBM as well as the PID processes. The incorporation of Al percentage with 

different fluencies and processes are tabulated (Table I).

The Al incorporation percentage increases with ion fluence in both the processes. In the IBM process, the Al atomic 

percentage in AlGaN increases ~3 % with increasing the fluence from 1E16 to 5E16 ions·cm-2. Whereas, in the case 

of PID process, increase in atomic percentage of Al with the ion fluence is limited to ~1.7 %. Therefore, it  may be 

concluded that the IBM is more suitable for the random alloy formation as compared to that of with the PID process. 

C. Luminescence Properties 

In order to investigate the optical properties, PL spectra for samples irradiated with fluences 1E16 and 5E16 

ions·cm-2 in both the IBM  and the PID processes  were also recorded. The typical PL  spectra of as-grown and the 

sample at different conditions are shown in the Figure 5.  

FIG. 5. Typical PL spectra of  as-grown  GaN and Al/GaN NWs  for different Ar+  fluences of (a) 1E16 and (b) 5E16  ions·cm-2 

synthesized with different processes of (i) IBM (ii) PID. Vertical dashed line is a guide to eye for the red shift of DAP peak position. 

10 

 
 
 
 
 
The as-grown GaN NWs show a peak centered at ~3.28 eV, which is attributed to the recombination of the 

neutral donor-acceptor pair (DAP), originating due to a transition of electrons from the possible presence of a shallow 

donor state of nitrogen vacancy (VN) to a deep acceptor state of Ga vacancy (VGa).22,23 The quenching of PL emission 

in the  irradiated sample (Fig. 5) is attributed to the trapping of radiative charge  carriers  by  large  number of point 

defects produced by the high energy ion irradiation. The DAP emission peak is found to evolve with post irradiation 

annealing at 900 and 1000 oC in both IBM and PID processes. However, for sample irradiated with a fluence of 1E16 

ions·cm-2 in the case of the IBM process, the evolved DAP emission shows [Fig. 5a(i)] a red shift of ~30 and 50 meV 

for 900 and 1000 oC annealed samples, respectively. Similarly the DAP emission for sample irradiated with a fluence 

of 1E16 ions·cm-2 in case of the sample synthesized in PID process [Fig. 5a(ii)] also shows a red shift of ~30 and 60 

meV for 900 and 1000 oC annealing, respectively. The increase in defect density at the time of irradiation leads to the 

creation of a large number of VN with a possible generation of a band of defect related energy levels possessing a 

lower energy state than that of the as-grown GaN. Therefore, the red shift observed for the DAP emission may be 

attributed to the transition from deep defect levels instead of shallow donor levels.24 Similar observations were found 

in the PL studies performed on the as-grown sample and the sample irradiated with higher fluence of 5E16 ions·cm-2 

[Figs. 5b(i) and 5b((ii)]. Moreover,  both  the 900 and 1000  oC annealed sample show  higher red  shift  of the  DAP 

emission peak observed for the sample irradiated with a fluence of 5E16 ions·cm-2 as compared to that for the samples 

synthesized  at  a  fluence  of  1E16  ions·cm-2.  While  ion  irradiation  can  create  new  defects  in  some  materials,  it 

simultaneously anneal out pre-existing defects in some others  (dynamic annealing)  with respect to ion energy  and 

fluence.25 Therefore the further red shift of DAP emission in the samples irradiated with a higher fluence of 5E16 

ions·cm-2 can be attributed to the creation of deep defect states by annealing out the existed shallow defect states of 

GaN. Furthermore, the relative intensity of DAP emission of AlGaN synthesized in both IBM and PID processes with 

an irradiance fluence of 5E16 ions·cm-2 is greater than that of the samples synthesized with a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-

2. This can be attributed to the dynamic annealing of the defects at the higher fluence of 5E16 ions·cm-2.26

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

In  summary,  AlGaN  nanowires  (NWs)  were  synthesized  by  the  ion  beam  mixing  (IBM)  and  the  post 

irradiation  diffusion  (PID)  processes  using  GaN  NWs  grown  in  the  catalyst  assisted  chemical  vapor  deposition 

technique. Vibrational studies with the help of resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS) for the post irradiation annealed 

Al/GaN  sample  showed  the  one-mode  phonon  behavior  corresponding  to  A1(LO)  mode  of  the  random  alloy.  The 

amount of Al incorporation estimated from the RRS studies in the AlGaN sample increases with ion fluence in both 

the processes. Highest Al atomic percentage of ~6.3-6.7% is achieved in AlGaN at a fluence of 5E16 ions·cm-2 in the 

ion irradiation process. Moreover, gradual red shift of donor acceptor pair (DAP) emission with increasing irradiation 

fluence and post  irradiation annealing temperature  in  AlGaN shows the creation of  deep level defect states  in the 

Al/GaN matrix as compared to that of GaN.

FIG. 1. Typical FESEM images for the samples synthesized using IBM and the PID techniques for an Ar+ fluence of 

(a) 1E16 and (b) 5E16 ions·cm-2. (i) as-grown GaN NWs; Al/GaN with post irradiation annealing at 1000  oC in the 

(ii) IBM and (iii) PID processes. Inserts showing the high magnification images of the respective samples.  

FIG. 2. Typical Raman spectra of as-grown GaN and Al/GaN NWs in different steps of the (a) IBM and (b) PID 

processes irradiated with a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-2. Vertical dashed line is a guide to eye for the peak position of 

E2(high) mode. 

FIG. 3. Typical resonance Raman spectra of as-grown GaN and Al/GaN NWs in different steps of the (a) IBM and 

(b) PID processes irradiated with a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-2. Vertical dashed line is a guide to eye for the blue shift 

of A1(LO) mode. 

FIG. 4. Lorentzian line shape fitted (a ) E2(high) and (b) A1(LO) mode of as-grown and 1000  oC annealed samples 

irradiated with a fluence of 1E16 ions·cm-2 in the IBM and the PID processes. Vertical dashed line is a guide to eye 

for the significant blue shift of A1(LO) mode. 

FIG. 5. Typical PL spectra of as-grown GaN and Al/GaN NWs for different Ar+ fluences of (a) 1E16 and (b) 5E16 

ions·cm-2 synthesized with different processes of (i) IBM (ii) PID. Vertical dashed line is a guide to eye for the red 

shift of DAP peak position.
