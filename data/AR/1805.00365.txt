ABSTRACT

Since their discovery by SDO/AIA in EUV, rapid (phase speeds of ∼1000 km s−1),

quasi-periodic, fast-mode propagating wave trains (QFPs) have been observed accom-

panying many solar ﬂares. They typically propagate in funnel-like structures associated

with the expanding magnetic ﬁeld topology of the active regions (ARs). The waves pro-

vide information on the associated ﬂare pulsations and the magnetic structure through

coronal seismology. The reported waves usually originate from a single localized source

associated with the ﬂare. Here, we report the ﬁrst detection of counter-propagating

QFPs associated with two neighboring ﬂares on 2013 May 22, apparently connected

by large-scale, trans-equatorial coronal loops. We present the ﬁrst results of 3D MHD

model of counter-propagating QFPs an idealized bi-polar AR. We investigate the ex-

citation, propagation, nonlinearity, and interaction of the counter-propagating waves

for a range of key model parameters, such as the properties of the sources and the

background magnetic structure. In addition to QFPs, we also ﬁnd evidence of trapped

fast (kink) and slow mode waves associated with the event. We apply coronal seismol-

ogy to determine the magnetic ﬁeld strength in an oscillating loop during the event.

Our model results are in qualitative agreement with the AIA-observed counter prop-

agating waves and are used to identify the various MHD wave modes associated with

the observed event providing insights into their linear and nonlinear interactions. Our

observations provide the ﬁrst direct evidence of counter-propagating fast magnetosonic

waves that can potentially lead to turbulent cascade and carry signiﬁcant energy ﬂux

for coronal heating in low-corona magnetic structures.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) (Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics

Observatory (SDO) has provided unprecedented high-resolution, high-cadence, nearly continuous

view of the full-Sun corona in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) since its launch in 2010. This allows

routine detection of many types of coronal EUV waves (see, e.g., the review by Liu & Ofman 2014).

In particular, since their initial detection (Liu et al. 2010, 2011) and identiﬁcation with 3D MHD

modeling (Ofman et al. 2011), quasi-periodic fast propagating (QFP) magnetosonic wave trains are

now routinely observed to accompany ﬂares (e.g., Liu et al. 2012; Shen & Liu 2012; Shen et al. 2013,

2017, 2018; Yuan et al. 2013; Kumar & Manoharan 2013; Nistic`o et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015;

Goddard et al. 2016; Qu et al. 2017). The QFP waves can carry signiﬁcant energy ﬂuxes (on the

order of 105 erg cm−2 s−1) needed to heat the active-region (AR) corona. However, the contribution of

these events to coronal heating is probably small due to their infrequent occurrences, based on present

observations. Nevertheless, many such QFP wave trains have been observed and are now available

in a statistical study of the order of 100 events (Liu et al. 2016). Numerical modeling of QFPs was

ﬁrst performed using 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in a bipolar AR model (Ofman et al. 2011),

and was later studied using 2D MHD models as waves trapped in an MHD wave-guide (Pascoe et al.

2013, 2017) or generated by quasi-periodic perturbations resulting from magnetic reconnection (e.g.,

Yang et al. 2015; Takasao & Shibata 2016; Takahashi et al. 2017).

The propagation and phase speed of QFP waves provide information on the magnetic structure of

ARs, and it has been shown that the quasi-periodicity is directly related to ﬂare pulsations (e.g., Liu

et al. 2011) and to radio bursts (e.g., Yuan et al. 2013; Goddard et al. 2016; Kumar et al. 2017).

The importance of QFPs in coronal diagnostics is rooted in the direct connection that they provide

between the driving solar ﬂare or coronal mass ejection (CME) and the underlying AR magnetic

structure as inferred from their co-temporal evolution and co-spatial origin.

In particular, QFPs

can shed light on the long-standing puzzle of ﬂare pulsations seen in a wide range of wavelengths

from radio to hard X-rays. Moreover, these fast mode waves are propagating, thus, sampling the

coronal magnetic ﬁeld over a signiﬁcant spatial extent in an AR and beyond. The events that produce

QFPs often induce damped coronal loop oscillations of large amplitudes that can be used for coronal

seismology (CS) (e.g., see the reviews Nakariakov & Verwichte 2005; Liu & Ofman 2014; Wang 2016)

of the closed loop structures in the AR magnetic ﬁeld.

In the present paper we report the ﬁrst observation of counter-propagating QFP wave trains that

appear to interact and are associated with coronal loop oscillations. There are only few observations

of counter-propagating fast mode waves in the low corona with potential evidence in transequatorial

4

Ofman and Liu

loops (e.g., Tomczyk & McIntosh 2009; De Moortel et al. 2014). Related counter-propagating Alfv´en

waves, which could be associated with fast magnetosonic waves in inhomogeneous structures, are

often invoked for the nonlinear interaction and generation of turbulence in incompressible plasma

that leads to energy cascade towards small scales and eventually to plasma heating. Observational

evidence for such counter-propagating waves has been found in the solar wind (e.g., Tu et al. 1989;

Bruno et al. 1997; Bruno & Carbone 2005).

The observational analysis of counter-propagating QFPs and associated wave modes provide moti-

vation for the numerical 3D MHD modeling of counter-propagating QFP wave trains in an idealized,

but general bipolar AR model. The goal of the model is to identify and investigate the various wave

modes in the observation with coronal seismology applications (coronal wave heating is not modeled

explicitly here). The model provides insights on the MHD mode couplings due to linear and non-

linear eﬀects, for several scenarios of magnetic geometry and wave sources. The paper is organized

as follows: in Section 2 we present the SDO/AIA observations, analysis of the counter-propagating

QFP wave trains, and transverse loop oscillations; in Section 3 we describe the details of the MHD

model of the counter-propagating QFP wave trains; Section 4 is devoted to numerical results of the

model; and ﬁnally the conclusions and discussions are presented in Section 5.

2. SDO/AIA OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS

On 2013 May 22, an M5.0 class ﬂare occurred in NOAA AR 11745 (N13W75) at 12:35 UT and

peaked at 13:32 UT in GOES soft X-ray ﬂux (see Figure 3(a)). This ﬂare was associated with a

major eruption involving a ﬂux rope (Li & Zhang 2013; Cheng et al. 2014) and a fast CME at a

speed of ∼1400 km s−1 (Ding et al. 2014). This eruption also produced a global coronal EUV wave.

About 25 minutes after the onset of this ﬂare, another, secondary ﬂare occurred at 13:00 UT in

the neighboring AR 11746 (S20W75) across the equator. This secondary ﬂare could potentially be

a sympathetic event following the ﬁrst ﬂare, because of their close timing and spatial separation

(e.g., Pearce & Harrison 1990). Both ﬂares produced QFP waves, some of which appear to be

propagating in opposite directions along the large-scale, trans-equatorial loops that connect the two

ﬂares. The interaction between these counter-propagating fast-mode wave trains and the properties

of the propagating and trapped waves are the main focus of this study.

Figure 1 shows context images of this event from SDO/AIA. The trans-equatorial loops that connect

the two ﬂaring sites between opposite magnetic polarities1 can be seen in panel (a) at 12:00 UT, just

before the ﬂare onset. This is the observational basis for our adoption of a dipole geometry in our

simulation described in Section 3. In Figures 1(b) and (c), the two ﬂares at later times (13:59 and

13:30 UT) during the gradual phase are evident, with the arcade of bright loops fully developed and

hot emission above it best seen in the AIA 94 ˚A channel in red (panel (c)). Note that the trans-

equatorial loops are not obvious in panel (b), which is likely a result of EUV dimming due to the

CME eruption (e.g., Zarro et al. 1999). The evolution of this event can be best seen in the animations

available in the online article.

The QFP waves are most evident in AIA 171 ˚A running diﬀerence images, as shown in Figure 2.

Panel (a) shows an example of QFPs propagating outward from the primary ﬂare in AR 11745

early on at 13:02 UT. After the second ﬂare develops, QFP waves propagating in opposite directions

apparently along the marked trans-equatorial loops between the two ﬂares become more evident.

Panel (b) shows an example of two counter-propagating wave-fronts at 13:06 UT just before they

meet and apparently interact. Partly because of their high speeds and coherence over a large distance

range, the QFPs are best seen in the online animation accompanying Figure 2. They appear to

may not represent the true magnetic polarities. However, these trans-equatorial loops were also evident a few

days earlier when the two ARs were on the disk far from the limb with minimum LOS eﬀects (see, e.g.,

http://sdowww.lmsal.com/suntoday/index.html).

have similar wavelengths and amplitudes between the counter-propagating wave fronts. In addition

to QFPs, other changes in the surrounding corona, as well as signatures of trapped waves in the

adjacent loops are evident. In particular, transverse oscillations of active region loop bundles can

be seen in the animations accompanying Figure 1, marked with an arrow there (see below for their

detailed analysis). We also ﬁnd EUV brightenings traveling along the loop at times, which we

interpret as likely evidence of slow-mode waves coupled with kink oscillations that cause further

density, temperature, and thus EUV intensity variations. This interpretation is supported by the 3D

MHD modeling results, presented in Section 3 below.

While it is possible that the two QFP waves are independent of each other and their apparent

interaction is a result of LOS integration of optically-thin EUV emission, it is very likely that the

interactions are real as supported by (i) the presence of trans-equatorial loops and evidence of mag-

netic connectivity, (ii) the exactly opposite directions of propagation of these wave fronts with narrow

angular extents, (iii) the space – time analysis results (Section 2.1), and (iv) the 3D MHD modeling

(Section 3) results presented below.

2.1. Space-time analysis

We performed space – time analysis of the 2013 May 22 double ﬂare/QFP event using various spatial

cuts on SDO/AIA images (indicated on Figure 1(c)) and determined the propagation speeds of the

QFPs, as well as the oscillation properties of the adjacent loops.

Figures 3(a) and (b) show ﬂare light curves to provide a timeline context. Panel (a) shows the GOES

soft X-ray ﬂuxes in two channels, 1–8 ˚A(red) and 0.5–4 ˚A (blue), that include the contributions of

both ﬂares combined. Panel (b) shows the spatially resolved AIA 94 ˚A light curves of the two ﬂares

individually. The peak intensity of the secondary ﬂare (blue) is about 10% that of the main ﬂare

(red). If we assume that the AIA 94 ˚A intensity is proportional to the GOES X-ray ﬂux, this suggests

that the secondary ﬂare is on the order of GOES C5 class. Also note the 25 minute delay of the

secondary ﬂare from the onset of the primary ﬂare.

We selected four cuts for the space – time analysis, as shown in Figure 1(c): Cuts 0 and 1 are along

the open funnel structure rooted at the main and secondary ﬂare locations, respectively, which we

use to capture the signatures of the outward propagating QFPs; Cut 2 traces the trans-equatorial

loops connecting the two ﬂares and is used for catching trapped modes, and Cut 3 is across the loops,

with which we track both trapped modes and propagating QFPs. The resulting space–time plots are

shown in Figures 3(c)–(f). These are running ratio plots, i.e., each column of the space–time image

is divided by the previous column of an earlier time frame in order to highlight subtle, rapid changes.

This also helps minimize the eﬀects of diminishing (on average) coronal emission with height that

results primarily from gravitational stratiﬁcation of the density.

In general, evidence in emission variability due to QFPs is captured in all four cuts, especially in

Cuts 0–2, and appears as recurrent, steep, narrow stripes.

In the open-funnel Cuts 0 and 1 (see

Figures 3(c)–(d)), the stripes show mainly positive slopes, corresponding to outward propagating

waves. The waves from the main ﬂare (Cut 0) are particularly strong, traveling to more than 500(cid:48)(cid:48)

(370 Mm) from the ﬂare, and lasting for more than two hours. This is a long duration compared

to other features variability timescales, and in fact, the longest among all reported QFP events so

far. In comparison, the open-funnel QFPs from the secondary ﬂare travel only about a third of that

range and only appear sporadically in time, but overall they are equally long lasting.

More interesting are the waves captured in the closed loop Cut 2 (see Figure 3(e)), where waves

traveling in opposite directions are both present as evident from positive and negative slopes in

the space – time diagram, and of comparable amplitudes in intensity variations (about 2%–4%).

Although waves originating from each ﬂare site appear upon the onset of its source ﬂare, the counter-

propagating waves are most evident during the period of 13:00-14:00 UT, as can be also seen in

an enlarged view in Figure 8(b). These waves have a broad range of periodicities with typical

periods falling in the 2–3 minutes range. These counter-propagating QFPs seem to be independently

generated by their respective source ﬂares, because of their tight temporal correlations with their

ﬂare onsets, but we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of reﬂections of the same QFPs from the

opposing footpoints of the loops. Note that evidence for QFPs propagating in opposite directions

(Liu et al. 2011, see their Figure 3) and the reﬂection of a single fast-mode wave pulse (Kumar &

Innes 2015), both in closed loops associated with a single ﬂare within a single AR of diﬀerent events,

10

have previously been reported. However, the large amplitudes and spatial extents, and the long

duration of the clearly apparent counter-propagating QFPs between two ﬂares situated in two ARs

presented here for the ﬁrst time are truly remarkable.

As to the determination of the phase speeds of these waves, we applied parabolic ﬁts to selected

wave signatures in the space – time plots to provide examples for the speed ranges. We found initial

speeds ranging from about 1000 to 4000 km s−1. The highest speeds are found in the closed loops

at early times when the QFPs waves can be unambiguously identiﬁed close to the source ﬂares.

Comparably smaller initial speeds are seen later and at locations further away from the source ﬂare,

partly because the rapid growth of the ﬂare arcade and its EUV intensity (shown as the shallow-

sloped features near the top and/or bottom edges of the space–time plots in Figure 3) prevent us

from tracking individual QFP pulses close to the ﬂare locations. For each wave pulse we ﬁnd that

it generally decelerates as traveling away from the AR, which is consistent with the expectation of

Alfv´en and fast-mode speed decreasing with height from the 3D MHD model of the bipolar AR (see,

e.g., Figure 5(b)). Details of the wave kinematics can be seen in the enlarged space – time plots in

the left panels of Figure 8.

In addition to propagating QFPs, trapped modes are also evident, appearing as damped transverse

kink oscillations in the space – time plot of Figure 3(f) from the vertical Cut 3. To quantify the

damped oscillations, we identiﬁed the average positions2 of the oscillating loops from the sinusoidal

features shown here and removed the gradual trend of the non-periodic displacement by subtracting

a running smoothed version. The resulting positions were then ﬁtted with a damped sine function

2 Note that, unlike few simple cases (e.g., Liu et al. 2012; Liu & Ofman 2014), in general, multiple loop strands

participate in transverse oscillations, with various phase delays among them (see other examples, Aschwanden &

Schrijver (2011), their Figure 2), and and with each strand exhibiting temporally varying EUV intensities due to

density and/or temperature, and line of sight integration eﬀects. These eﬀects add to observational ambiguities for

tracking loop oscillations.

of time, as shown in Figure 8(c), which indicates a period of P = (21 ± 2) min, a damping timescale

τ = (6.2 ± 1.6)P , an initial amplitude of A0 = (16 ± 2) Mm, and an initial oscillation speed of

v0 = (79 ± 9) km s−1. This result will be used for coronal seismological analysis to infer the magnetic

ﬁeld strength, as detailed in Section 4.2 below.

These kink oscillations are mostly likely triggered by the combination of the initial CME eruption

and continuous QFPs launched from the ﬂares. The damping of the oscillations could result from

various processes, such as phase mixing, resonant absorption, and leakage of the waves (e.g., Ofman

& Aschwanden 2002; McLaughlin & Ofman 2008; Selwa & Ofman 2010; Selwa et al. 2011a), and we

believe that leakage is the best candidate for the damping in this case, since we do not ﬁnd strong

evidence of heating expected to accompany wave dissipation processes.

Following Liu et al. (2011), we estimate the energy ﬂux carried by the QFP waves with the kinetic

energy ﬂux of the perturbed plasma in the WKB approximation, E = ρ(δv)2vph/2 ≥ ρ(δI/I)2v3

ph/8,

where we assume that the observed intensity variation δI results from density modulation δρ and use

δv/vph ≥ δρ/ρ = δI/(2I) for magnetosonic waves since I ∝ ρ2 for EUV line emission intensity. This

can be written in a normalized form

Here we take typical values measured at the apex of the loop Cut 2, i.e., a phase speed of vph =

estimated with diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) inversion for the large-scale corona (see Sec-

tion 4.2). We then arrive at a lower limit of the energy ﬂux of E (cid:38) 1.8 × 105 ergs cm−2 s−1. Consider-

ing that the cross-section of the loops here has expanded substantially from the coronal base, where

the measured QFP speeds are also higher by about a factor of two, we estimate that the correspond-

ing energy ﬂux there (i.e., near the source ﬂare) would be at least one to two orders of magnitude

higher. Such energy ﬂuxes are more than suﬃcient for heating the local AR corona (Withbroe &

Noyes 1977), hence the importance of identifying and studying these waves in the solar corona.

3. MHD MODEL

While the high cadence, high resolution AIA EUV images in general provide valuable information

for the identiﬁcation of QFPs, it is well known that such data unavoidably suﬀer from observational

ambiguities, such as the line-of-sight projection eﬀect, the unknown magnetic ﬁeld strength, the true

3D geometry and the density structure. Use of observations alone may be insuﬃcient to uniquely

identify the MHD wave modes and their couplings. Such observational limitations thus necessitate

supporting 3D MHD modeling, presented below, providing the means to disentangle various physical

factors that contribute to the same observed feature and help identify the various MHD wave modes.

Moreover, by including several scenarios of wave sources and magnetic geometry in the model, we can

infer the importance and eﬀects of various parameters and make the numerical study more general

with potential applications to other observations. Note that we do not expect exact one-to-one

match between the observational and modeling results, because of the adoption of a simple bipolar

magnetic geometry with idealized boundary conditions, but this approach, without loss of generality,

does capture essential physics of MHD wave processes. Thus, the 3D MHD model provides realistic

mode coupling and includes nonlinearity, lacking in more simpliﬁed linear analysis.

For this purpose, we solve the nonlinear, resistive 3D MHD equations with the standard notation

for the variables given in a ﬂux-conservative form

of the heat conductivity term is small in the present case, where the dominant wave mode is a fast

wave, with shorts periods compared to the conductive dissipation time. Moreover, the present choice

of an empirical polytropic index diminishes the eﬀects of the source terms in the energy equation

since the plasma is nearly isothermal with empirical value of γ close to unity.

corona at the base of the active region. In the present study explicit viscosity is neglected. Other

the solutions are obtained as nonlinear perturbations with respect to an initial state subject to the

boundary conditions described below. The numerical code used in the present study is an extension

of the code NLRAT developed to study waves in coronal ARs and loops and tested in many previous

studies (e.g., Ofman & Thompson 2002; Terradas & Ofman 2004; Ofman 2007; McLaughlin & Ofman

2008; Ofman 2009; Selwa & Ofman 2009, 2010; Selwa et al. 2011a,b; Ofman et al. 2011, 2012; Wang

et al. 2013; Ofman et al. 2015; Provornikova et al. 2018).

3.1. Initial State and Boundary Conditions

The AR is modeled in a Cartesian geometry, initialized with a bipolar magnetic ﬁeld produced

by a dipole located below the ‘surface’ (e.g., Cuperman et al. 1989; Ofman & Thompson 2002).

The magnitude of the normalizing magnetic ﬁeld is constrained to produce a 2500 km s−1 fast

magnetosonic speed at the lower boundary of the propagating QFPs, which is in the range of observed

speeds for our observationally guided model. The parameters of the dipole, such as the separation

of the magnetic poles and the location of the dipole source, determine the details of the magnetic

geometry of the model AR (e.g., Ofman et al. 2015). In particular, we set the aspect ratio between

the height and the footpoint separation of the magnetic loops to 0.7 to approximately match the

oscillating loops in the dual M5.0 ﬂare event observed with AIA in 171 ˚A on 2013 May 22. This

is achieved by using the dipole separation d = 2.5 in Equations (5)-(10) of Ofman & Thompson

(2002) (see Figure 4). We vary the values of d and other model parameters in several runs described

in Section 4 below.

In the model we choose an identical periodicity of 3 minutes, and vary the

separation of the QFP wave sources, the magnetic topology, and amplitude in a limited parametric

study that elucidates the main eﬀects of these parameters. More detailed parametric studies are

subjects for future work.

where vx,1,2 are the amplitudes of the driving sources, w1,2 are the half-widths of the source regions

at the lower boundary, ω1,2 are the frequencies, and φ1,2 are the phases. In all cases we use yi = 0,

and values of d, ω, xi, and vx,i = V0 are given in Table 1. The choice of these wave parameters is

motivated by the observations described in Section 2 with possible relevant variations. Since the fast

magnetosonic speed, Vf , is nonuniform in the bipolar AR, the location of the sources at the base

determines the direction of propagation of the waves due to the refraction of the wavefronts governed

by the Vf gradients. Thus, placing the sources of the waves near the opposite poles results in counter

propagating wave trains. In general, the model parameters with subscript 1 and 2 are independent,

and we have studied several scenarios with diﬀerent locations of the two sources guided by the

observed event. The remaining boundary conditions at z = 1 are vy = vz = 0, with B components,

density ρ, and pressure are extrapolated from the interior points. The boundary conditions on the

top and sides of the computational domain are open, allowing the escape of the waves with negligible

reﬂection.

4. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Counter propagating fast magnetosonic wave trains

19

In Figures 6 – 7 we present the numerical results of several cases of QFPs excited at two locations

with the parameters summarized in Table 1.

In Figure 6 the snapshots of the relative density

perturbations, deﬁned as ∆ρ/ρ0 (where ∆ρ ≡ ρ − ρ0), the velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld lines are

shown for Cases 1 – 3 in the x − z plane at y = 0 of the model AR. The times are t = 119τA (Case 1),

t = 98.4τA (Case 2), and t = 98.3τA (Case 3). At these times the oscillations are in or nearly at

the steady state. From the animations and the space-time analysis (see below) it is evident that the

QFPs excited at opposite footpoints of magnetic loop produce propagating as well as trapped waves.

The propagating waves crossing the AR bipolar magnetic ﬁeld structure are evident in the density

and velocity perturbations, as expected for fast magnetosonic waves. These waves leave the domain

at the top and side boundaries. However, the two QFPs also excite trapped modes, as evident in

the velocity and density perturbations inside the loops of the AR magnetic domain. The density

structure is modiﬁed by the nonlinear eﬀect of magnetosonic wave pressure in these magnetic loops,

consistent with previous observations and modeling studies in a more simpliﬁed cylindrical coronal

loop geometry (e.g., Terradas & Ofman 2004) and in bipolar magnetic geometry (McLaughlin &

Ofman 2008; Selwa & Ofman 2009, 2010; Selwa et al. 2011a,b; Ofman et al. 2012). The trapping

eﬀect is strongest for the cases where waves are excited at exactly conjugate footpoints of the same

magnetic loop, where the height of the apex of the excited loops is directly related to the footprint

separation. When the locations of the QFP wave excitation is non-symmetric with respect to the

AR magnetic structure (Case 3), the location of the trapped waves is shifted towards the location

of the more distant wave source (see, Figures 6e-6f). Nevertheless, both, propagating and trapped

waves are evident in Case 3 as well.

In order to examine the eﬀects of the dipole ﬁeld topology, such as the aspect ratio between the pole

separation and the height of magnetic loops, in Case 4 we use the same parameters as in Case 1, but

with smaller separation of the magnetic poles, d = 2 (see Figure 7). The QFP waves were excited

at the same locations, i.e., x1,2 = ±2.0 with identical periods and amplitudes. We ﬁnd that the

main diﬀerence between Cases 1 and 4, is the increased height of the magnetic loops that carry the

trapped mode in Case 4 compared to Case 1, due to the diﬀerence in topology of the dipole magnetic

ﬁeld with d = 2.0 compared to d = 2.5. Speciﬁcally, the wave sources in Case 4 are located at the

footpoints of comparably taller magnetic loops than those in Case 1. This changes the relative spatial

distribution of the fast-mode speed Vf , whose spatial gradient governs the propagation direction of

fast-mode magnetonoic waves, and these waves propagate obliquely to the direction of the magnetic

ﬁeld lines. In addition there is a change in the wavelength and relative amplitude of the propagating

components due to the change of the fast magnetosonic speed dependence with hight, with more

rapid decrease of B with height, compared to the decrease of the density with height.

In the Appendix, we discuss the temporal evolution of various physical variables for the QFP-wave

driven perturbations at a ﬁxed location in the 3D model AR. Speciﬁcally, Figures 9–11 show the

details of the phase relations between these variables, which help the identiﬁcation of the dominant

22

Ofman and Liu

wave modes at this location.

4.1. Comparison to observations

Figure 8. Comparison of space–time plots from the observations (left) and simulations (right), showing the

deceleration of QFPs with distance (top panels), counter-propagating waves (middle panels), and trapped

kink oscillations (bottom panels). See text for details.

In Figure 8 we compare space – time plots of the observed EUV intensity from the 2013 May 22 QFP

event described in Section 2 and of the plasma density perturbations from the 3D MHD simulations of

the counter-propagating QFPs in the model AR, since the density is directly related to the emission

measure and thus the EUV intensity. To make direct comparison with observations, we applied the

same parabolic ﬁts to simulated wave trajectories. bf We show the results of Case 1 that emphasizes

Counter propagating fast magnetosonic wave trains

23

the symmetric interactions of the counter QFPs, and Case 3 to show the eﬀects of slightly non-

symmetric QFPs excitation. In the left panels of Figure 8 we show the AIA 171 ˚A intensity running

ratio plots from the loop Cut 2 connecting the two neighboring ﬂares during (a) the early phase

and (b) the late phase, and (c) from the vertical Cut 3 (i.e., enlarged subregions of Figures 3(e)

and (f)). In the right panels of Figure 8 we show the density perturbations space–time plots from

simulations: (d) from a vertical cut located at (x, y) = (−0.75, 0) in Case 1, (e) along a magnetic

ﬁeld line in the x–z plane passing through (x, z) = (0, 1.5) in Case 3, and (f) from a vertical cut

located at (x, y) = (−1, 0) in Case 1. The cuts in the model are indicated with dashed line styles

in Figure 6. Panels (d) and (e) are running ratios, while (f) is a running diﬀerence to highlight the

kink oscillations at low heights. The low-laying loop was chosen to show the counter-QFPs since it

is below the trapped mode wave region. The dimensionless distance has been converted to physical

distance in units of arcseconds. The white dotted lines in the top and middle panels are parabolic

ﬁts to selected wave trajectories, with the initial and average speeds indicated for the ﬁrst ﬁt of each

panel showing similar magnitudes. The cyan curve in (c) is a ﬁt to the transverse oscillations of the

trans-equatorial loops with a damped sine function, with the best-ﬁt parameters indicated at the

bottom of the panel. The cyan curve in (f) indicates transverse oscillations in the simulation.

We found remarkable agreement between the observed and simulated space–time plots. In particu-

lar, the dominant propagating waves from the main ﬂare during the early phase shown in Figure 8(a)

resemble those simulated upward propagating waves shown in Figure 8(d), both in the form of steep

stripes with the QFP periodicity and fast-mode wave speed, as well as considerable deceleration. The

counter-propagating waves between the two ﬂares during the late phase shown in Figure 8(b) are

also quite similar to those captured on a closed magnetic ﬁeld line of the dipole in Figure 8(e), where

the free parameters of the 3D MHD model are the magnitudes of the magnetic ﬁeld, density, and

temperature at the coronal base (see Section 3). Note that the shallow-sloped, recurrent features in

24

Ofman and Liu

Figure 8(e) with typical speeds of ∼140 km s−1 are due to slow mode waves launched from the QFP

source region.

The model results are in excellent agreement with the observations in terms of wave propagation

morphology phase speed range and couplings, and also exhibit transverse oscillations of qualitatively

similar periodicities and intensity variations. From our analysis of the modeling results, it is evident

that the oscillations are due to the trapped kink mode in the loop structure, while the intensity

variation is a result of a slow magnetosonic wave driven nonlinearly by the QFPs.

In summary, both the trapped oscillations and propagating QFPs are evident in the observations

and simulations, allowing the conﬁrmation of their physical nature due to the various MHD modes,

with additional evidence of the slow mode in the intensity variation of the observed oscillating loops.

4.2. Coronal Seismology

In order to infer the typical magnetic ﬁeld strength, we apply coronal seismology (e.g. Nakariakov

& Verwichte 2005) by using the observed properties of the oscillating loops (including their period

and density) in the 2013 May 22 event.

We identify the most evident oscillating loop (as marked by the arrow in Animation 2) that

corresponds to the transverse oscillations shown in Figure 8(c). This loop has a width of w =

(1.14 ± 0.11) × 109 cm and a length of L = (5.41 ± 0.54) × 1010 cm, inferred by ﬁtting the AIA 171 ˚A

loop in the plane of the sky with a curve ﬁt and assuming a 10◦ longitudinal span along the line-of-

sight (as indicated by the EUV images).

We estimate the plasma density of this loop using the DEM inversion technique of Cheung et

al. (2015). To do so, we constructed DEM maps of this region in multiple temperature bins in

the log T = 5.5 to 7.5 range. We then selected ﬁve loop segments of 20(cid:48)(cid:48) long near the loop apex

spaced by 20(cid:48)(cid:48) to 50(cid:48)(cid:48). We obtained the spatially averaged DEM of each segment, DEM0, and of its

Counter propagating fast magnetosonic wave trains

25

immediate neighborhood above it of a similar size, DEMbkg, which was used as a background to be

subtracted to obtain the DEM for the loop itself, DEMloop = DEM0 − DEMbkg. The loop density

is thus given as n =

(cid:113)

[(cid:82) DEMloopdT ]/w. We use the average of the densities of ﬁve segments as

the ﬁnal estimate for the loop density and their standard deviation plus a 10% systematic error as

the uncertainty, ni = (6.34 ± 0.80) × 108 cm−3. Likewise, the background density is estimated from

n =

(cid:113)

[(cid:82) DEMbkgdT ]/Rs at no = (9.01 ± 1.24) × 107 cm−3, by assuming a line-of-sight integration

length of Rs. This gives a loop density contrast of no/ni = 0.14 ± 0.04.

Using the oscillation period (P = 21 ± 2min = 1260 ± 120 s) from Figure 8 and the values of the

density and loop length inferred above, we obtain the kink speed Ck as

Ck = 2L/P = 2 × 5.41 × 1010/1260 cm s−1 = 8.59 × 107 cm s−1 = 859 km s−1,

(9)

using the fundamental mode of oscillation. Since the kink speed depends on the Alfv´en speed and

on the loop density contrast as (e.g., Nakariakov & Verwichte 2005)

Ck = VA

(cid:115)

2
1 + no/ni

,

(10)

we derive the value of the Alfv´en speed inside the loop VA = B/(2πρi)1/2 = 651 km s−1 and using

the loop density ni obtained above we ﬁnd the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld B = 5.3 G. The

fast magnetosonic speed inside the loop can be obtained from Vf,i = (V 2

A + C 2

s )1/2 = 670 km s−1 for

a perpendicular propagation angle. Outside the loop the fast magnetosonic speed becomes Vf,o =

[V 2

A(ni/no) + C 2

s ]1/2 = 1744 km s−1, consistent with the range of QFP propagation speeds that we

ﬁnd in the observations and in the 3D MHD model, as indicated in Figure 8. In the above analysis

the uncertainties are on the order of 10%.

The magnetic ﬁeld intensity of the dipole in the 3D MHD model decreases rapidly with height in

agreement with observed active region ﬁeld structure, and with the present model normalization, we

ﬁnd B ≈ 5 G near the center of the 3D model AR, in agreement with the above coronal seismology

26

Ofman and Liu

result. However, the average magnetic ﬁeld strength along the magnetic loop with its apex at the

center of the model AR is substantially higher due to the contribution of the stronger magnetic

ﬁeld near the footpoints (see also, Ofman et al. 2012, 2015). Moreover, the high density contrast

of the individual loop is not included in the simpliﬁed model. This is acceptable, because the main

properties of 3D MHD modeling are already in agreement with observations, and the present study

is not aimed at quantitative coronal seismology with the 3D MHD model.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We report and analyze the ﬁrst detection of counter-propagating QFP waves associated with two

neighboring ﬂares observed by SDO/AIA in EUV on 2013 May 22. We ﬁnd that the two ﬂaring

regions are connected with large-scale trans-equatorial coronal loops, and the waves propagate across

the magnetic structures in opposite directions at large speeds of the order >1000 km s−1. These

observations provide evidence of counter-propagating fast magnetosonic wave trains, as well as their

interaction and generation of trapped waves that are identiﬁed as damped kink modes in adjacent

coronal loops. Using space – time analysis, we measure the properties of the various wave modes,

such as the phase speeds in various directions, and study properties of the loop oscillations. We also

apply coronal seismology using loop oscillations during the event, and determine the magnitude of

the magnetic ﬁeld in these loops with the density obtained from DEM analysis. The corresponding

phase speed of the QFPs from coronal seismology analysis is in agreement with the observationally

determined range of values.

Using the observations as a guideline, we utilize our 3D MHD code to setup and model the bipolar

AR and study the counter-propagating QFPs from the two ﬂaring sites, simulated by the time-

depended periodic boundary conditions. We investigate the excitation, propagation, and interaction

of the counter-propagating waves for various combinations of diﬀerent excitation locations and bipolar

Counter propagating fast magnetosonic wave trains

27

magnetic geometries in a limited parametric study. We conﬁrm the identiﬁcation of fast-mode waves

as the dominant modes for the propagating component, as well as damped kink mode and nonlinearly

generated slow mode waves for the trapped component in the magnetic loops. We ﬁnd that the 3D

MHD model reproduces the main observed features of the counter-QFPs in the dual ﬂare event on

2013 May 22 seen by SDO/AIA providing insights on linear and nonlinear MHD mode excitation,

propagation and couplings. These results provide new evidence of the correlation of ﬂares, QFPs,

and the related trapped (kink mode) waves in AR coronal loops.

In particular, when the excitation locations of counter-QFPs are symmetric with respective to the

dipole, they lead to formation of both propagating fast-mode waves and standing kink mode waves

due to trapping of the waves in closed loops.

In addition, the magnetic wave pressure variation

produces a slow magnetosonic wave, that eventually leads to the formation of a standing slow mode

wave in the loop. However, the slow magnetosonic wave is energetically insigniﬁcant due to its small

amplitude and low phase speed and the correspondingly small energy ﬂux that is proportional to

the sound speed. With similar amplitudes of the velocity perturbations, the QFPs carry most of the

energy ﬂux supplied by the ﬂares due to their large fast magnetosonic phase speed in the low plasma

β corona. While the nonlinear eﬀects due to the magnetic wave pressure are signiﬁcant in producing

some steepening of the wave fronts, and compressional waves, they are weakly nonlinear in all cases

for the parameters relevant to the observed event.

We ﬁnd that the asymmetric excitation of the counter-QFPs in the model is in best agreement

with the observed event, where there is a 25 minute delay between the onset times of the two

ﬂares. Since Alfv´en and fast mode waves are coupled in inhomogeneous plasma the counter-QFPs

could facilitate the onset of turbulent cascade and MHD wave dissipation in the lower corona. It

is therefore important to note that our observations provide the ﬁrst direct evidence of counter-

propagating fast magnetosonic waves that can carry suﬃcient energy ﬂux for coronal heating in

28

Ofman and Liu

the reported observation, similar to the ﬂux needed in Alfv´en waves in low-β coronal plasma, thus,

supporting the scenario of counter-propagating waves leading to turbulence dissipation. While the

QFPs can couple to the Alfv´en mode, the signiﬁcant compressibility and the oblique propagation of

QFPs with weak trapping is very diﬀerent from the properties of pure Alfv´en waves in incompressible

plasma, and some of the QFP energy ﬂux can dissipate through other processes, such as compressive

damping.

We note that thus far, since the beginning of the SDO mission in 2010, only about a dozen QFP

events have been reported with detailed analysis and about 100 more events have been identiﬁed in

a statistical study (Liu & Ofman 2014; Liu et al. 2016). Almost all these events were associated with

ﬂares of various magnitudes.

If this relatively low detection rate represents their true occurrence

rate on the Sun, this would imply that QFPs, as seen by SDO/AIA in EUV, are possibly not the

primary contributor to heating the global solar corona. On the other hand, we speculate that if

the hypothesis of nanoﬂares being responsible for coronal heating holds (e.g., Parker 1988), and if

most nanoﬂares produce QFPs that carry a signiﬁcant fraction of their energy ﬂux, then one would

expect that dissipation of numerous small-scale QFPs can make signiﬁcant contribution to coronal

heating. However, same as for nanoﬂares, such QFPs are below the direct detection threshold of the

current instruments. Thus, the role of QFPs in coronal heating remains to be veriﬁed with future

instrumentation of improved capabilities.

APPENDIX

Here we show the temporal evolution of the QFP wave driven perturbations of various physical

variables at a ﬁxed point in the 3D model AR. The details of the phase relations between the variables,

helping the identiﬁcation of the dominant wave modes are evident in the temporal evolutions shown

in Figures 9–11. The evolution at x = 1.2, y = 0, z = 3.5 for Case 1, with QFPs excited at

x1,2 = ±2.0 is shown in Figure 9. The initial interval of ∼ 10τA without wave signal is the time for

the perturbations to reach the ‘observational point’ in the model AR. The velocity components Vx

(solid), and Vz (dots) oscillate in phase, while the Vy (dashes) shows a quarter wavelength phase shift.

While Vx and Vz belong to the fast magnetosonic wave component of the QFPs, the Vy component is

Alfv´enic, and is produced by the couplings in the non-uniform dipole ﬁeld. Note that the perturbed

magnetic ﬁeld (with respect to the initial dipole) component ∆Bx is in anti-phase with Vx, and there

is a quarter wavelength shift between ∆Bz and Vz. These phases are likely due to the interaction

between the two counter-QFPs, since a quarter wavelength shift is typical for a standing wave mode,

comparing to Figure 5 in Ofman et al. (2011) for a single-source QFP wave.

The temporal evolution of the perturbed density ∆ρ and temperature ∆T (where the perturbations

are with respect to the initial state) at x = 1.2, y = 0, z = 3.5 for Case 1 are shown in in Figure 9(c).

It is evident that the oscillations of ∆ρ and ∆T are nearly in phase, where the small phase shift is

due to the small eﬀect of thermal conduction, similar to the phase shift in slow magnetosonic waves

(see, e.g., Owen et al. 2009; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2015).

In addition to the

oscillations, there is a small gradual increase in the average background density and temperature due

30

Ofman and Liu

to the eﬀects of the wave pressure on the background.

In Figure 10 the temporal evolution of the variables at the same ﬁxed point (x, y, z) = (1.2, 0, 3.5) as

in Figure 9 but for Case 3 are shown. The main eﬀects of the non-symmetric double QFP excitations

is the change in phase relations between the z components of the velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld,

and the deviation from pure sinusoidal oscillations. Also, the initial transient state is evident up

to t ≈ 30τA in velocity and magnetic ﬁeld perturbations, and to somewhat longer time in density

and temperature perturbations. Following this initial transient, the variables reach nearly steady

oscillations. While the nonlinear eﬀects are present in all cases, they are of small magnitude due

to the low amplitude of the QFP velocity sources compared to the local fast magnetosonic speed

(see Table 1). In order to demonstrate the eﬀect of the amplitude on the nonlinearity, in Case 5 we

use V0 = 0.04, doubling the amplitude of Case 3. Figure 11 shows the evolution of Case 5, where the

stronger nonlinearity is most evident in the non-sinusoidal velocity ﬂuctuations due to the waves, as

well as in the magnetic ﬁeld, density, and temperature perturbations. The eﬀect of stronger wave

pressure results in larger perturbations in the density and temperature in this case, as evident by

comparing the scales of the perturbations in Figures 10(c) and 11(c).
