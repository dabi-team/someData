Abstract 

We  present  results  on  the  deposition  and  characterization  of  defected  graphene  by  the 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The source of carbon/carbon-containing radicals is 
thermally decomposed acetone (C2H6CO) in Ar main gas flow. The deposition takes place on 
(001)  Si  substrates  at  about  1150-11600C.  We  established  by  Raman  spectroscopy  the 
presence  of  single-  to  few-  layered  defected  graphene  deposited  on  two  types  of  interlayers 
that  possess  different  surface  morphology  and  consisted  of  mixed  sp2  and  sp3  hybridized 
carbon. The study of interlayers by XPS, XRD,  GIXRD and SEM identifies  different  phase 
composition:  i)  a  diamond-like  carbon  dominated  film  consisting  some  residual  SiC,  SiO2 
etc.; ii) a sp2- dominated film consisting small quantities of C60/C70 fullerenes and residual Si-
O-,  C=O  etc.  species.  The  polarized  Raman  studies  confirm  the  presence  of  many  single-
layered defected graphene areas that are larger than few microns in size on the predominantly 
amorphous carbon interlayers.  

1.Introduction  
Graphene  is  one-atom  thick  layered  material,  which  consists  of  completely  sp2-bonded 

carbon atoms, tightly-packed into a honeycomb lattice. It has a number of unique properties like 

low  optical  absorption,  high  electrical  conductivity,  high  mechanical  strength,  interesting 

membrane properties, etc. Several different paths for synthesizing graphene have been followed 

experimentally  during  the  last  decade.  However,  only  the  thermally-  and  plasma-assisted (PA) 

chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on metal substrates (copper, nickel, etc.) (Kim et al. [1], Reina 

et al. [2], etc.) and epitaxial growth on SiC substrates (Berger et al. [3,4]) have been developed 

 
 
 
industrially. The latter method is based on C (or Si) termination of the (0001)C (or (0001)Si) SiC 

surface and requires high temperature and expensive SiC substrates. The former method is based 

on PA thermal decomposition of a carbon-containing precursor on a catalytic metal surface. This 

method provides high reliability and relatively high quality of the graphene films and presently 

there are many suppliers of reactors for PACVD of graphene. The most preferred precursor for 

this method is methane (CH4) because the chemical bond in CH4 is relatively strong and prevents 
fast decomposition of the reagent at temperatures below 10000C (Muñoz and Gómez-Aleixandre 

[5]). The main challenge in the application of the PACVD method is that even if the synthesized 

graphene  was  perfect,  it  cannot  be  used  directly  in  microelectronics  and  has  to  be  transferred 

from metal to another surface, which usually generates a large number of defects. Therefore, the 

problem  with  the  deposition  of  graphene  on  silicon  or  surfaces  compatible  with  silicon 

technology is still unsolved. We investigated the possible application of acetone as a precursor in 

a thermally-assisted CVD and showed in a recently published work (Milenov et al. [6]) that few-

layered  defected  graphene/folded  graphene  can  be  deposited  on  commercially  available  metal 

foils like Ni, (Cu0.5Ni0.5),  μ-metal  and stainless  steel  SS 304. Here,  we are aim at  studying the 

possible  deposition  of  graphene/graphene  related  phases  (few-layered  defected  graphene, 

polygraphene etc.) on (001) Si substrates via thermal decomposition of acetone. 

2. Experimental 

2.1 CVD process 

We  used  2  inch  (001)  Si  substrates  and  a  horizontal-tube  quartz  CVD  reactor  with 

internal diameter of about 70 mm. The experimental setup also consists of a gas-supply system 

(inlet and outlet parts), a barboteur for evaporation of acetone which is situated in a thermostat, a 

quartz substrate support and a resistive heating furnace (Fig. 1). The CVD process  is  based on 

thermal decomposition of acetone in Ar main gas  flow. The temperature of the thermostat was 
kept  at  120C.  The  heating  of  the  reactor  from  room  temperature  to  working  temperature  takes 
place  at  a  rate  of  about  3000C/h  in  atmosphere  of  pure  Ar  flow  of  about  120-180  cm3/min.  In 

order  to  prevent  the  super-saturation  in  the  high-temperature  zone  of  the  reactor  we  used  a 

“pulsed” regime in some experiments by alternating the flow of the gas mixture of (Ar + C3H6O) 
for  3  min  on  top  of  the  main  flow  of  pure  Ar  of  about  150-180  cm3/min  for  1.5  min  for  each 

 
pulse. The parameters of the deposition processes are summarized in Table 1. The reactor with 
deposited samples was cooled after the deposition at a rate of about 150-2000C/h. 

2.2 Characterization 

We  characterized  the  carbon  layers  by  Raman  spectroscopy,  optical  and  scanning 

electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction 

(XRD) and by grazing incidence beam XRD (GIXRD).  

The Raman measurements were carried out using a micro-Raman spectrometer HORIBA 

Jobin Yvon Labram HR 800 Visible with a He-Ne (633 nm) laser. The laser beam with 0.5 mW 

power  was  focused  on  a  spot  of  about  1  μm  in  diameter  on  the  studied  surfaces,  the  spectral 
resolution being 0.5 cm-1 or better.  

We  used  LYRA  TESCAN  scanning  electron  microscope  at  30  kV  accelerating  voltage 

for  the  SEM  studies  without  deposition  of  any  conducting  amorphous  film  on  the  studied 

specimens.  

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was applied for the investigation of the graphene thin 

films grown by CVD over silicon substrate. The XPS spectra were taken from different points of 

the  surface  of  the  film  in  order  to  monitor the  growth  mechanism  of  the  films  as  well  as  their 

thickness uniformity and homogeneities. XPS measurements were performed on a Kratos AXIS 
Supra spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) source in vacuum better than 10-8 

Pa  at  90  degree  take-off  angle.  Each  measurement  was  initiated  with  a  survey  scan  from  0  to 

1200  eV,  pass  energy  of  160  eV  at  steps  of  1  eV  with  1  sweep.  For  the  high  resolution 

measurements, the number of sweeps was increased, the passed energy was lowered to 20 eV at 

steps of 100 meV. The C1s photoelectron line at  284.6 eV was used for calibration of spectra. 

The  surface  composition  was  determined  from  the  ratio  of  the  corresponding  peak  intensities, 

corrected with the photo ionization cross sections. The C1s, O1s, N1s, Si2p photoelectron lines 

as  well  the  survey  scan  have  been  recorded.  The  point-focused  XPS  measurements  were 

performed  in  series  of  five  points  on  a  linear  segment  and  separated  by  0.5  mm  for  each 

characterized sample.  

XRD measurements were performed using PANalytical Empyrean apparatus in different 

geometries (φ, (θ- 2θ) and (ω- 2θ) scans). The most prominent features in the XRD patterns of 
the  initial  (θ-2θ)  scans  are  reflections  at  2θ=  26.240  and  69.070,  which  correspond  to  d(002)  of 

 
graphitic carbon (ICSD -31170) and d(004) of Si substrate (ICSD-29287). Further on, φ scans (in 
the  range  φ=  0-  3600)  with  reference  to  C(002)  and    Si(004)  reflections  were  performed.  Finally, 
GIXRD  measurements  (in  ω-2θ  scans)  were  conducted  at  ω=0.100  and  ω=0.300  because  the 
critical angle for total reflection of graphene is 0.210 (T. Schumann et al. [7]) and the penetration 
depth at grazing angle of 0.100 in carbon does not exceed 20-25 Å.  

3. Results 

3.1 Optical and scanning electron microscopy 

Two  areas  with  different  surface  morphology  were  observed  by  optical  microscopy,  as 

shown in Fig. 2. Namely, a clear relief of ridge-like formations, lying along <001>, covers the 

central  area  denoted  as  “R”,  while  the  surrounding  area,  denoted  as  “H”,  is  covered  by  an 

optically  inhomogeneous  film  with  a  constant  thickness.  It  should  be  noted  that  some  optical 

inhomogeneity is also observed on the R areas.  

The SEM observations (Figs. 3 a-f) show that the surface relief on the R areas is clearly 

distinguishable  in  both  secondary  electron  (SE)  and  backscattered  electron  (BSE)  regimes. 

Moreover,  a  lot  of  sub-micron  crystallites  in  different  grades  of  grey  are  observed  in  the  BSE 

images (Fig. 3 d) indicating a different chemical composition of the crystallites situated on the 

ridge-like  relief  on  the  R  areas.  On  the  other  hand,  the  observed  contrast  changes  of  the  SE 

image of the H area with submicron dimensions (in light-grey color in Fig. 3 e) should be related 

to carbon flakes because the corresponding BSE image (Fig. 3 f) does not show any change of 

the  contrast.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  surface  morphology  of  the  thin  films  deposited  in 

different  experimental  series,  revealed  by  optical  (Fig.  2)  and  scanning  electron  microscopies 

(Fig. 3 a- f), is completely the same. 

3.2 XPS studies: point XPS study of irradiated area of diameter of 650 μm 

It  is  clearly  established  that  the  C1s  photoelectron  lines  provide  information  about  the 
existence of sp2- and sp3-hybridized carbon bonds, as well as other types of bonds on the surface 

of the films within about 5 to 10 nm depth. In Fig. 4, we present the results of the XPS study, 

conducted in 5 neighboring points on the surface of a sample from the 3PTH experimental series. 

The analyzed points 1- 4 comprise both H and R areas in different ratio, but the R area in point 2 

 
 
significantly exceeds the R area of points 1, 3 and 4. The results are representative for all XPS 

measurements of all studied samples. 

C1s photoelectron spectra, taken from all five examined points, are shown in Fig.4a and a 

rescaled  one  is  shown  in  Fig.  4b.  The  nonsymmetrical  C1s  photoelectron  peaks  are  situated  at 

284.4  eV  (Fig.  4a)  and  are  broadened  towards  higher  energies  (Fig.  4b),  which  points  to  co-
existence  of  sp2-  and  sp3-hybridized  carbon.    Analysis  of  the  higher  binding-energy  side  (296- 

300  eV)  reveals  characteristic  features  of  different  types  of  fullerenes  (clearly  distinguishable 

shake-up satellites of the C1s peak, Fig. 4b). The shake-up satellites in this region are ascribed to 

the  unchanged  electronic  density  of    and  σ  orbitals,  when  planar  graphene  is  curved  to  form 

fullerene.  Then  the  difference  in  the  shake-up  structure  is  that  the  plasmon  is  a  solid  state 

phenomenon in graphite, while it is a collective oscillation of the charge of the single molecule 

in the fullerene/s (Ref. [8]). According to this work, these shake-ups appear at different energies 

depending on their origin: the graphite  shake-up appears at 290.9 eV, those of C84 at  288eV and 

291 eV, while C70 and C60 show shake-ups at 287.5 , 289, 291 eV and 287, 290, 291, 294, 298 

eV,  respectively.  The  most  pronounced  features  in  the  binding  energies  interval  296-  300  eV 

(Fig.  4  b),  are  features  at  287.5  (shoulder),  289  and  291  eV.  Several  weak  peaks  at  287  (very 

weak shoulder), 290 (in points 2, 3 and 4), and 294 eV are also distinguishable. The C60 shake-up 

at  298  (not  shown  in  Fig.  4  b)  is  observable  in  the  spectrum  taken  from  points  4  and  2.  In 

addition it should be noted that the shake-up satellite of graphene appears at 290 eV and overlaps 

with those of graphite and C60 ( Ref. [9]).  

The  C1s  peaks,  measured  in  different  points,  were  subjected  to  fitting  procedure  for 
calculation of the ratio of sp2- to sp3-hybridized carbon and evaluation of the presence of other 

types of carbon bonds [10-12]. As an example, only fitted C1s spectra, recorded at point 1 and 

point  2, are shown  in  the  Fig. 5 a and b, respectively.  It is  worth  noticing that, additionally  to 

graphene  and  fullerene,  SiC  type  bond  was  evident  in  the  spectra  of  C1s,  taken  at  the  same 
position (see C1s for point 2). The calculated sp2/sp3 ratios as well as the concentrations of the 

constituent elements in the film are summarized in Table 2.  

The presence of silicon in Si-O and SiO2 groups was detected from the observed peaks in 

the Si2p spectra at 101.8 eV and at 103.4 eV (Fig. 6 a and b), respectively [13]. The quantity of 

Si-O  and  SiO2  varies  at  the  different  positions  on  the  surface.  In  the  case  of  higher  amount  of 

SiO2, we detect also a small amount of SiC (peak at 100.3 eV) in the film (point 2) (Ref. [13]).  

From  the  obtained  results,  we  conclude  that  graphene  film  is  deposited  on  the  Si 

substrates. The presence of different interlayers between graphene and the Si substrate can also 
be  deduced.  The  quantity  of  sp3-hybridized  carbon  is  significantly  higher  in  the  R  areas 

compared  to  the  H  areas  and,  therefore,  it  can  related  to  diamond-like  carbon  (DLC).  On  the 
contrary,  the  H  area  is  dominated  by  sp2-hybridized  carbon  and  can  be  related  to  amorphous 

carbon  (aC).  The  observed  SiC  and  the  increased  SiO2  content  in  the  DLC-rich  areas  allows 

concluding  that  parallel  deposition  of  SiC  and  complete  oxidation  of  Si-  substrate  takes  place 

during the initial steps of the deposition process. It can be assumed that the remaining part of the 

surface  is  also  oxidized  but  via  Si-O  groups,  and  further  formation  of  a  more  complex  layer, 
dominated by sp2-hybridized carbon.  

3.3 XRD studies:  
We  used  φ  scans  in  the  range  φ=  0-3600  with  reference  to  d(002)  of  graphitic  carbon  at 
2θ=26.60  (see  ICSD  -31170)  and    d(004)  of  silicon  at  2θ=69.130  (see  ICSD-29287)  reflections 

(Fig.  7a)  and  in  order  to  determine  the  most  suitable  orientation  for  further  XRD  studies.  The 

distribution of the diffracted signal from graphitic (002) planes with φ (the blue trace in Fig. 7 a) 

shows that the orientation of the deposited layers follows the orientation of the substrate because 
the number of counts per second is doubled at 2θ ~730 and ~2530, but this dependence is very 

weak.  

XRD patterns, recorded in (θ- 2θ) scans, shown by the blue traces in Figs. 7 b, c and d, 
reveal the presence of SiC (ICSD-24217) at 2θ= 35.70, graphitic carbon (ICSD -31170), several 

features of C70 fullerenes (ICSD- 75506) (marked by 1-4 in Fig. 7 b and c) in the range of (12- 
24)0 values of 2θ, and the most prominent feature in Fig. 7 d - the merged reflections of d(023) = 
d(113) at 2θ= 17.400 and d(130) at 2θ= 17.700 (see (ICSD- 75506)). The absence of these features in 

the (ω-2θ) scans  points  to  the conclusion that  fullerenes  are  formed  on the  initial  stages of  the 

deposition and are situated near to the interface Si  substrate/interlayer. This result supports the 

XPS results and the conclusion that the interlayers contain some C70 fullerenes.  

The GIXRD measurements of the sample from the 3PHT series (Fig. 7 b) shows a very 
weak reflection of d(111) of SiC (at 2θ= 35.750) with increasing intensity for decreasing grazing 

angle,  indicating  a  possible  increased  content  of  SiC  in  the  volume  of  the  film.  The  GIXRD 

measurements  of the sample  from  the STHT series  (Fig. 7 c panel)  reveals  both  AB- and AA- 

 
(002) at 2θ= 26.570 corresponding to d(002)= 3.35 Ǻ  as well as CAA

stacked carbon (CAB
(002) at 2θ= 
26.080 corresponding to d(002)= 3.53 Ǻ  , respectively, Lee et al. [14]) as well as the weak peak at 
2θ= 35.750 Ǻ, corresponding to SiC. The intensity ratios of the reflections of CAA

(002) to CAB

(002) 

decrease  significantly  with  increasing  ω,  which  points  to  increased  relative  mass  of  the  AB- 

stacked graphite with  depth  related to  the AA-stacked few-layered  graphene phase, situated on 

the surface. The GIXRD patterns of the sample from the MTHT series are similar to those from 

the  sample  from  the  STHT  series,  but  we  did  not  observe  a  clear  peak  of  AA-stacked  carbon. 

Moreover, a weak peak of {111} diamond planes (ICSD- 28857) is observed in the (ω-2θ) scan 
at ω=0.10. This weak reflection disappears with increasing ω for the (θ- 2θ) scans as well  and, 

therefore, it can be concluded that this phase appears on the surface of the deposited layers.  

3.4 Unpolarized and polarized Raman spectroscopy of as-deposited samples 

The  Raman  spectrum  of  graphene  has  a  clearly  established  fingerprint  [15].  The  main 

first-order features in the Raman spectra of graphene and defected graphene, excited at 633 nm 

wavelength, are the following:  

-G  band  (~1582  cm-1)  is  the  only  band  in  graphene  allowed  by  selection  rules  for  the 

first-order  Raman  scattering.  It  is  ascribed  to  the  optical  doubly-degenerate  phonons  of  E2g 

symmetry at the Γ point, initially described by Tuinstra and Koenig [16];  

-D  band  (~1330  cm-1)  is  due  to  breathing-like  motion  of  hexagonal  carbon  rings, 

belonging  to  the    transverse  optical  branch  near  the  K  point,  and  requires  a  defect  for  its 

activation via intervalley double-resonance Raman processes [17];  

-D’  band  (~  1615  cm-1;  defect-induced  similarly  to  the  D  band)  occurs  via  intravalley 

double-resonance processes [18];  

-D” band (~1145 cm-1) results from double-resonant intervalley scattering of LA phonons 

on defects [19]. The intensity of this band is normally ~100 times lower than that of the D band.  

Overtones and combination bands: 

-2D  band  is  historically  known  from  graphite  and  carbon-nanotube  related  literature  as 
the G’ band; appears at ~2648-2665 cm-1. It is clearly shown [20- 25] that the shape and width of 

the 2D band can be used for identiﬁcation of mono-, bi- and three-layered graphene.  

-the  overtones  of  the  D’-  peak  (2D’),  combination  G*  (G*=  (iTA+LA)  phonons),  and 

(D+D’) bands occur around 3230, 2450 and 2930 cm-1, respectively [26].  

 
The Raman spectrum (excited at 633 nm laser wavelength) taken from the H area of the 

3PHT,  STHT  and  MTHT  series  (Fig.  8),  contains  all  features  typical  for  graphene,  namely,  a 
clearly  pronounced  2D  band  with  full  width  at  half  maximum  (FWHM)  of  40-58  cm-1,  I2D/IG 

ratio between 2 and 3.5 and I2D/ID ratio between 2 and 4. However, the 2D band appears at about 
2660- 2668 cm-1, i.e., it is blueshifted by about 10-15 cm-1 and it is somewhat broadened by 10-
12 cm-1, when its FWHM is ~40 cm-1. 

The 2D bands are blueshifted by ~10- 20 cm-1 and can typically be deconvoluted into: (a) 
a single Lorentzian with FWHM of ~40-41 cm-1 (Fig. 9 a) and (b) four Lorentzians with FWHM 
of  25  (±1)  cm-1  with  total  width  of  45-  50  cm-1  (Fig.  9  b).  The  results  of  the  deconvolution 

indicate  the  presence  of  single-  and  bi-layered  defected  graphene,  respectively  [20-25]. 

Analyzing the inset of Fig 8, it is worth noting, that the 2D band is symmetrical in the spectrum, 

taken  from  the  3PHT  series,  most  probably  due  to  the  presence  of  single  layered  defected 

graphene, asymmetrically broadened on the higher-energy side of the spectrum from the SHTH 

series,  most probably  due to  the presence  of bi-layered defected  graphene, and  asymmetrically 

broadened on the lower-energy side of the spectrum from the MTHT series, most probably due 

to the presence of multi-layered defected graphene. Comparing the intensity of these bands to the 

intensity of two-phonon band of the Si substrate (the feature, marked by IISi in Fig. 8) it can be 

concluded that the thickness of interlayers is lower in the 3PHT films, while it is highest in the 

MTHT films. In addition, we did not establish a clear difference between the quality of graphene 

layers deposited on aC- and DLC-rich interlayers, however, bi- and few-layered areas were more 

frequently observed on DLC-rich interlayers. The results for predominantly single-layered (SL) 

and  bi-layered  (BL)  defected  graphene,  according  to  the  deconvolution  of  2D  bands,  are 

summarized  in  Table  3.  We  established  that  single-  and  bi-  layered  graphene  is  very  often 

observed in 3PHT samples, bi- and multi- layered defected graphene - in STHT samples, while 

we did not establish single and bi-layered graphene in MTHT samples.  

Casiraghi  et  al.  [27]  studied  theoretically  and  confirmed  experimentally  that  different 

graphene  edges  exhibit  variations  in  the  intensity  of  the  D  band  (ID)    in  different  scattering 

geometries  and  concluded  that  armchair  type  graphene  edges  are  expected  to  contribute  to  ID. 

The  intensity  of  the  D  band  exhibits  a  maximum  (IDmax)  when  the  incident  light  is  polarized 
parallel  to  the  armchair  type  graphene  edge  and  follows  a  cos2ψ  law,  when  the  laser  light 

propagates  perpendicularly  to  the  graphene  layer  and  the  polarization  is  rotated  around  the 

propagation direction by an arbitrary angle ψ. The zigzag graphene edge does not contribute to 

the  intensity  of  the  D  band  and  in  Ref.  [27]  an  analytical  expression  for  distinguishing  of  the 

different complex graphene edges was derived. We perform similar measurements in Z(YψYψ)Z 

as well as in Z(YψXψ)Z  geometries, assuming that Z axis is perpendicular to the graphene layer 

and ψ is the angle between the polarization and the [010] direction of Si substrate. Both parallel 

(YY=HH)  and  cross  (YX=HV)  scattering  geometries  were  used.  The  measurements  were 
performed starting from ψ = 00 (corresponding to Z(Y’Y’)Z in Porto notations, where Y’≡ [110] 
of  Si  substrate)  and  ended  at  ψ  =2350.  We  measured  the  polarized  Raman  spectra  of  several 

3PTH  samples  and  one  MTHT  sample.  The  results  of  two  rotational-angle  dependent  Raman 

measurements are presented in Fig. 10 a and b. We used the ID/IG ratio because IG is independent 

on the angle ψ. In the measured Raman spectrum of a 3PHT sample in HH scattering geometry, 
we established that the ID/IG ratio moderately increases from 00 to 450, then it significantly drops 
upon changing of the angle from 450 to 1350 and increases again in the interval between 1350 and 
2250,  which  follows  roughly  the  ID~  cos2(ψ)  law  (Fig.  10  a).  The  intensity  ratio  was  found  to 

vary  between  0.6  and  0.85.  The  polarized  Raman  spectra,  taken  in  similar  conditions  from  a 

control sample from  the  MHTH series  with  deposited  few-layered defected graphene, does not 

show any simple dependence (Fig. 10 b).  We cannot deduce any systematic dependence on the 

dependence of the angle ψ in HV scattering geometry in both specimens (see HV-marked traces 

in Figs. 10 a and b).  

4. Discussion 

The  above  results  can  explain  the  relatively  high  intensity  of  the  D  band  in  the 

predominantly single-layered graphene of the 3PHT series. Namely, the intensity of the D band 

decreased to about 60% of the intensity of the G band in absence of graphene edges enhancing 

the D band appearance. Therefore we can relate the high intensity of the D band to the presence 

of a large number of defects in graphene films and of micro-sized graphene flakes, bordered by 

mixed zigzag and armchair shaped edges. It seems that the mix is dominated by armchair shaped 

edges because the pure zigzag edges do not influence the intensity of D band [27].  

However,  the  observed  broadening  and  blue-shift  of  the  2D  band  cannot  be  clearly 

explained.  We  showed  in  our  recent  work  [28]  that  the  2D  band  in  exfoliated  flakes  by  the 

“scotch-tape method” has similar characteristics, namely,  the  FWHM remains  in  the range 38- 

 
40  cm-1  and  is  observed  at  2658-  2660  cm-1,  but  it  is  likely  that  graphene  in  [28]  was  not 

separated from the interlayer of predominantly amorphous carbon. Moreover, the 2D band in a 

graphene film undoubtedly separated from the interlayer (exfoliated on epoxy resin) has FWHM 
of 27-29 cm-1 and is observed at 2555 cm-1. Therefore, we can attribute this broadening of the 2D 

band to the influence of amorphous and DLC enriched interlayers.  

It should be clearly  noted that we could not deposit graphene/defected graphene phases 

directly on the Si substrates.  

We did not observe any feature of C60 and C70 fullerenes by the conducted Raman studies 

and assumed that this is correlated with the experimental conditions. Namely, we present results 

of  unpolarized  and  polarized  Raman  spectra  of  the  surface  of  the  as-grown  specimens.  On  the 

contrary, we observed the main Raman features of C70 fullerenes with decreasing intensity with 

interlayers’ depth in samples after exfoliation by the scotch-type method [28].  

According  to  the  above  results  we  can  conclude  that  the  deposition  takes  place  in  few 

stages:  

-initial formation of stable seeds of a sp3-hybridized carbon phase, mixed with some SiC 
and  SiO2  species,  most  probably  at  surface  structural  defects  (dislocations  etc.),  and  a  sp2-

hybridized carbon phase, mixed with some Si-O species; 

-further  deposition  of  thin  DLC  films  in  the  range  of  few  nanometers  on  the  area, 
occupied by sp3-dominated carbon phases and of a thin amorphous carbon (aC) films on the area, 
occupied by sp2-dominated carbon phase; 

-deposition of defected graphene on both areas at the final stage of the process. 

The synthesis of a separate phase with diamond structure on the surface of the films from 
MTHT series is unexpected. However, it could be recalled that the deposition of sp3-hybridized 

carbon films and diamond nano- to micro-crystals was already reported earlier [29]. The MTHT 

series  are  deposited  at  high  temperatures  and  for  a  relatively  long  deposition  time  and  we  can 
suppose that the formation of a completely sp3-hybridized carbon phase at suitable positions on 

the R areas occurs. 

5. Conclusions  

We reported the deposition of few-layered graphene on (001) Si substrates by the CVD 

process via thermal decomposition of acetone. The deposition is carried out at high temperatures 

 
of  1150-11600C  in  an  Ar  main  flow.  The  deposited  layers  were  examined  by  SEM,  XRD, 

GIXRD,  XPS,  and  Raman  spectroscopies.  We  observed  that  predominantly  single-layered 

defected  graphene  (graphene  flakes  with  area  of  several  micrometers)  is  deposited  by  use  of  a 

pulsed regime, while the deposition for 9 and 12 minutes and similar other conditions resulted in 

bi-  to  few-layered  defected  graphene.  We  did  not  perform  a  successful  deposition  of 

graphene/graphene-related  phases  on  Si  substrates  directly  by  the  thermally-assisted  CVD 

process. We established that the deposition takes place arbitrarily on two types of interlayers: i) 
the  first  one  consists  of  a  mix  sp2-hybridized  highly  oriented  pyrolytic  graphite  (HOPG)  and 
amorphous carbon, containing also some sp3-hybridized carbon (in the range of a few molar %) 

as well as small quantity of C70 and C60 fullerenes; ii) the second one is a dominated by a DLC 
mix of sp3- and sp2-hybridized carbon, some cubic SiC (in the range of few molar %) as well as 

small quantity of C60 and C70 fullerenes. We observed also AA-stacked graphene and some nano-

diamond  fractions  on  the  top  surface  of  samples,  deposited  at  9  and  12  min  deposition  time, 

respectively.  On  the  contrary,  the  SiC  and  fullerenes  fractions  increase  with  the  depth  of  the 

interlayers, allowing to conclude that the initial stages of the CVD process comprise concurrent 

deposition  of  SiC  and  SiO2  species,  which  determines  the  formation  of  the  DLC-enriched 

interlayers as well as deposition of Si-O-C groups that determines the formation of aC-enriched 

interlayers. Further on, we can confirm that small quantity of C70 and C60 fullerenes are formed 

mainly during the initial  stages of deposition process,  especially, during the experiments  using 

“pulsed” regime of (C3H6O +Ar) gas-mix feeding.
