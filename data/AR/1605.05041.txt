Abstract

In this work we study the eﬀect of the nuclear tensor force on proper-
ties related with deformation. We focus on isotopes in the Mg, Si, S, Ar, Sr
and Zr chains within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory using the D1ST2a
Gogny interaction. Contributions to the tensor energy in terms of saturated
and unsaturated subshells are analyzed. Like-particle and proton-neutron parts
of the tensor term are independently examinated. We found that the tensor
term may considerably modify the potential energy landscapes and change the
ground state shape. We analyze too how the pairing characteristics of the
ground state change when the tensor force is included.

Introduction

The tensor force get a major role in the nucleon-nucleon interaction.
Indeed in
a boson exchange picture the nuclear interaction is generated at long range by a
pion exchange between two nucleons. The associated potential (One Pion Exchange
Potential) is composed by a central and a tensor term. Besides the requirement
to include a tensor term to the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction is supported by
some well known experimental data such as the none zero quadrupole moment of the
deuteron [1, 2, 3] or the diﬀerential cross section of the p-p scattering. Consequently
all the most popular potentials used in the ab-initio approaches as the Paris [4], Bonn

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
[5, 6, 7] or Argonne [8] potentials get a built-in tensor component. Its impact on
the shell structure properties has been studied in a large extent: its contribution to
the single particle energies depends on the ﬁlling of the shells; it induces correlations
which strongly inﬂuence the n-p pairs structures in light nuclei [9]; the tensor force
enables to get a convenient spectrum in the p-shell [10].

In contrast the tensor term was initially neglected in self-consistent mean ﬁeld
theories except for a few exceptions [11].
It should be emphasized here that in
eﬀective ﬁeld theories some part of the bare tensor interaction is already taken into
account in the central part of the eﬀective interaction. As a consequence only the
residual tensor interaction was neglected in the usual Skyrme [12, 13] or Gogny
[14, 15] eﬀective interactions.

However the tensor force get a renewed interest over the past few years in mean
ﬁeld theories. A lot of works recently aimed to determine the most reliable tensor
term built-in eﬀective interaction.
It is now clear that the tensor term modiﬁes
the single particle energies [16] and the binding energies [17], the multipoles giant
resonances [18, 19] and even may aﬀect the magic numbers and the spin-orbit splitting
in some cases [20].

The inclusion of the tensor term in the eﬀective interaction has been done in
perturbation from pre-existing parametrizations [21, 22, 23] where all the other pa-
rameters remain unchanged. Alongside a full variational procedure is performed to
get the new parametrizations for the Skyrme [24, 25] and Gogny [20] interactions.
In all cases it rises the problem of the way to ﬁt the parameters. Otsuka et al. [20]
make the overall ﬁt of the interaction using the properties of the AV8 potential [17] to
adjust the tensor strength. Lesinski et al. [24] built 36 parametrizations of the zero
range Skyrme interaction including a tensor term. They are obtained by studying
the structure properties such as the spin-orbit splitting or the single particle energies
on the Ca, Ni and Sn chains. In the works of Zalewski et al. [26, 27] and Grasso et
al. [28] the spin-orbit strength is modiﬁed at the same time that the tensor parame-
ters to reproduce some single particle properties, (spin-orbit splittings) in the doubly
magic 40Ca, 56Ni and 48Ca nuclei. The work of Grasso et al. enables to reduce the
number of parametrizations suggested by Lesinski et al. excluding the ones whose
parameter signs do not lead to satisfactory results.
In addition, while the tensor
term is adjusted in some local structure properties some eﬀorts have been done to
constraint the tensor strength from collectives excitations properties [30, 29, 31, 18]
in the Skyrme Hartree–Fock+Random Phase Approximation framework.

In the present study we aim to analyze the impact of the tensor term on the
deformation of the even-even nuclei in the Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov approximation.
We use the D1ST2a Gogny interaction proposed by Anguiano et al. and built on

2

the ﬁnite range D1S Gogny interaction [15] with a ﬁnite range tensor term [23].
This tensor term incorporates both a pure tensor and a tensor–isospin contribution.
Keeping the D1S parameters unchanged the two tensor parameters were adjusted to
reproduce the neutron single particle energies 1f5/2 and 1f7/2 in 48Ca. Reﬁtting a
nuclear eﬀective interaction in a global procedure as it is done in [24] for the Skyrme
plus tensor interaction or in [20] for the Gogny plus a tensor–isospin term interaction
represents a considerable amount of work and is far beyond the scope of this study.
In the present paper we are interested in the eﬀect of tensor terms in the deformation
of the ground state of various nuclei using the D1ST2a interaction. Keeping the D1S
parameter set unchanged enables to isolate in a better way the speciﬁc tensor eﬀects
than in a consistent reﬁt of the interaction. Thus this study aims to isolate the
situations in which tensor contribution is important, in order to choose the most
pertinent observables to consider for a consistent reﬁt of the interaction.

We encountered a few works in the literature on that matter. The shape coex-
istence is analyzed for some N = 28 neutron-rich isotones in [33]. It is shown that
whereas the tensor force does not change the ground state the shape coexistence
between prolate and oblate states vanishes for 42Si and 44S. In the paper by Zalewski
et al. [27] the contribution of the isovector and isoscalar tensor terms to the binding
energy is depicted over the mass table. The impact of two Skyrme functionals on the
superdeformed band heads is tested. SkOTX is built on SkO [34] plus a tensor term
and SkOT(cid:48) get a modiﬁed spin-orbit strength and the same tensor part. It is pointed
out that deformation properties are very sensitive to the relative adjustment between
the SO and tensor term for both spin-saturated and spin-unsaturated cases. Bender
et al. [35] studied the Skyrme parametrizations depicted in [24] with respect to the
deformation properties of some magic and semi–magic nuclei, doing an analysis in
terms of the isoscalar and isovector parts of the tensor term. They showed that since
the eﬀect of the tensor depends on the ﬁlling of the single particle orbitals, the tensor
aﬀects the nuclear chart in a diﬀerent way. In particular Bender et al. observed that
in doubly spin-saturated nuclei the tensor contribution to the total energy increases
with the deformation whereas it is at sphericity that the tensor energy is the highest
for doubly spin-unsaturated.

Here we will attempt to deal with the tensor-deformation interplay by looking at
the change of shape in speciﬁc regions, analyzing in terms of like–particle and proton–
neutron contributions the tensor eﬀects. We study too the impact on the pairing
energy and spacial densities. We discuss too some diﬀerences found related with
considering or not the Slater approximation in our calculations. Sec. 2 is dedicated
to the introduction of the useful quantities and the numerical considerations of the
theoretical framework. Sec. 3 is devoted to the inﬂuence of the tensor term of the

3

D1ST2a Gogny interaction on the potential energy curves and structures properties
in the Zr, Mg, Si, S, Ar and Sr chains. We also aim to look at the way the tensor
energy is distributed in terms of isospin dependent contributions. Conclusions are
presented in Sec. 4.

2 Generalities

2.1 Computational Aspects

All the calculations reported here are carried out at the Hartree–Fock or Hartree–
Fock–Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation. It is assumed that the simplex, axial and
time reversal symmetries are preserved for all the calculations. The HFBAXIAL code
[36] uses a harmonic oscillator basis of the Fock space whose dimension is chosen
with respect to the nucleus under consideration. In that context the HFB states are
labeled by a set of quantum numbers namely the radial n⊥ the axial quantum number
nz (symmetry over the z-axis) the projection of the spacial and intrinsic angular
momentum m, sz on the symmetry axis. For all nuclei the number of major shells is
chosen as Nsh = 10. The oscillator length parameters are equal in each direction and
get the ﬁxed value b = 2.1 fm. If not explicitly speciﬁed the Coulomb interaction is
computed numerically with a Gauss Legendre integration, as it is explained in [40]
and some calculations will be performed using the Slater approximation. The two
body kinetic energy coming from the center of mass correction is computed for both
the Hartree–Fock and pairing ﬁelds. The local minima of the energy functional is
determined within the second order gradient method. Details of the method are
presented in [37] and references therein.

2.2 Tensor interaction

The tensor part that is considered in the interaction D1ST2a writes:
(cid:20)

(cid:21)

VTS ((cid:126)r1, (cid:126)r2) = (VT1 + VT2 P τ

12)

− (cid:126)σ1 · (cid:126)σ2

e−((cid:126)r12)2/µ2

T ,

(1)

((cid:126)σ1 · (cid:126)r12)((cid:126)σ2 · (cid:126)r12)
|(cid:126)r12|2

where (cid:126)r12 = (cid:126)r1 − (cid:126)r2 , P τ
12 is the isospin exchange operator and (cid:126)σ is the usual 3-
Dimension spin operator. For even-even nuclei the only non zero contribution to the
tensor energy comes from the exchange ﬁeld. The isospin dependence to the tensor
matrix element can be decomposed as a summation of like-particle (lp) part and
proton-neutron (pn) part:

(cid:104)τaτb|VT1 + P τ

12VT2|τbτa(cid:105) = (VT1 + VT2) δτaτb + VT2δτa−τb .

(2)

4

The two parameters VT1 and VT2 are −135 MeV and +115 MeV respectively. The
range µT in Eq. (1) is taken equal to 1.2 fm, corresponding to the longest range in
the D1S interaction.

Besides we can isolate the lp and pn contributions by modifying the values of VT1

and VT2. Deﬁning two new sets of parameters {V lp

T1, V lp

T2} and {V pn

T1 , V pn

T2 } such as:

(cid:40)

T2 = −20 MeV ,

V lp
T1 + V lp
V lp
T2 = 0 MeV ,

and

(cid:40)

V pn
T1 + V pn
T2 = 0 MeV ,
V pn
T2 = VT2 = +115 MeV ,

(3)

(4)

then replacing the {VT1, VT2} parameters in Eq. (1) by the new coeﬃcients {V lp
T1, V lp
T2}
the proton-neutron part vanishes and the like-particle term is unchanged. The op-
posite conclusion applies for {V pn
T2 }. Let’s note that adding these diﬀerent new
contributions give the initial parameters: V lp

T1 , V pn

T1 = VT1 and V lp

T1 + V pn

T2 + V pn

T2 = VT2.

2.3 Deformation parameters

In this section we summarize all the experimental and theoretical quantities involved
in the HFB calculations presented below dealing with the quadrupole deformation.
The spectroscopic quadrupole moment is deﬁned as (see [38], Appendix B):

QS =

(cid:114) 16π
5

(cid:104)I, M = I, K| ˆQlab

20 |I, M = I, K(cid:105) ,

(5)

where ˆQlab
is the electric quadrupole operator. M and K are the projection of
20
the total angular momentum I on the symmetry axis in the laboratory frame and
in the body-ﬁxed frame respectively. QS is deﬁned in the laboratory frame and is
measurable. The electric quadrupole operator is deﬁned as:

ˆQlab

20 = e

(cid:90)

V

ρp((cid:126)r)r2Y20(θ, ϕ)d(cid:126)r ,

(6)

where ρp((cid:126)r) is the proton density and e the electric charge. The intrinsic quadrupole
moment of the band Q0 is deﬁned as:

Q0 = (cid:104)I, M, K| ˆQint

20 |I, M, K(cid:105) ,

(7)

5

where ˆQint
for an axially symmetric nucleus to ([38], p25):

20 is the quadrupole moment operator in the body-ﬁxed frame. This leads

5π
R0 is the radius of the sphere with the same volume than the nucleus, taken as
R0 = 1.2A1/3 fm and β2 is one of the Hill-Wheeler coordinates [41] (γ2 = 0 in the
axially symmetric case).

ZeR2

Q0 =

0β2 .

(8)

It is possible to relate the spectroscopic quadrupole moment QS with the intrinsic

one when M = I by the following expression:

QS =

3K 2 − I(I + 1)
(I + 1)(2I + 3)

Q0 .

(9)

For the band head we usually have K = I ([38], p. 26).

The potential energy curves (PEC) presented below are plotted with respect to

the total deformation of the nucleus by the variable q(tot)

20

such as:

q(tot)
20 =

3
√
5π

(10)

q(tot)

quadrupole moments, q(p)

is the total quadrupole moment and is related to the proton and neutron
20 . These
(cid:114) 16π
5

latter quantities are obtained as the average value of the operator ˆQ20 =
r2Y20
in the HFB state. They can be expressed with respect to β2 replacing A by Z and
N respectively in Eq. (10). Consequently we get the relation (see Eq. (8)):

20 respectively, such as q(tot)

20 and q(n)

20 = q(p)

20 + q(n)

Q0

20 .

(11)

It is convenient to note that for all the nuclei presented below the PEC has been
computed with a β2 = 0.05 step.

Since we are only dealing with even-even nuclei all the states constituting the
PEC are 0+ states. For all the minima in the above PEC the theoretical Q0 is
extracted. Taking into account the deﬁnition of QS, it is clear that its value is
zero for 0+ states. The experimental QS values in the following tables are such as
I = 2. The experimental Q0 are extracted from the measured QS using Eq. (9).
The theoretical Q0 from 0+ states are compared to experimental Q0 from 2+ states
assuming that the intrinsic quadrupole moment does not change in a pure K-band.
For I = K = 2 we get QS = 2/7Q0 from Eq. (9), for I = 2, K = 1 QS = −1/7Q0
and for I = 2, K = 0 we have QS = −2/7Q0.

3 Results

The eﬀect of the tensor interaction on some properties regarding deformation are
analyzed for the Zr, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Kr and Sr isotopes chains in the HFB framework.
The general feature that we ﬁnd is that the tensor in most of the cases has a repulsive
eﬀect in its contribution to the total HFB energy. It raises the HFB energy by a
few MeV. The tensor contribution is zero for some cases and can be attractive for
speciﬁc points of a few potential energy curves.

In the case of several local minima the tensor term tends towards stretching the
local minima with respect to the deformation variable (i.e. oblate minima are more
oblate, prolate minima are more prolate for D1ST2a) and lower the energy diﬀerence
between the minima. If the minima are close in energy for D1S, D1ST2a can invert
the ground state location. First of all, we analyze the eﬀect of tensor by doing an
energy decomposition.

3.1 Tensor energy decomposition

Spin-saturated shells occur when both j = l + 1/2 and j = l − 1/2 subshells are
ﬁlled. For instance 80Zr is both proton and neutron spin-saturated at sphericity: the
proton and neutron subshells are ﬁlled up to the 2p1/2 one and its spin-orbit partner,
2p3/2, is also full.

is speciﬁed in the last column (SS for spin-saturated, SU for spin-unsaturated).

In order to study how the tensor force behaves we look at the tensor energy

7

contributions for speciﬁc nuclei at sphericity. In Table 1 the total tensor contribution
ETS(tot) to the D1ST2a HFB energy is presented. Using Eq. (2) we separate ETS(tot)
into its lp parts ETS(p − p), ETS(n − n) and its pn part ETS(p − n). For all the nuclei
both lp parts of the energy are attractive whereas the pn part is repulsive, with the
only exception of 78Sr for which the pn part is also attractive. The components get
very diﬀerent orders of magnitude, from a few keV to a few MeV. As a result the
total tensor energy can be both repulsive and attractive and is most of the time
dominated by a sole term.

In order to understand the way the energy arises we assume that only the va-
lence subshells and their spin-orbit partners contributes to the tensor energy, all the
contributions from fully ﬁlled up spin-orbit partner doublets being neglected. Thus
there are three types of contributions to the tensor energies: the ones where parti-
cles are in the same subshell, the ones where particles comes from both spin-orbit
partners and contributions where the particles are in uncorrelated subshells; one of
the two partners being the valence subshell in all cases. However when two spin-
orbit doublets are mixed up (typically the 2p and 1f subshells) we will also take into
account the non valence subshell level whose spin-orbit partner is above the Fermi
level. Thus we separate the energy contributions ETS(i − j) of isospin i − j according
to the subshells α, β... involved:

where Vij is VT1 + VT2 when i = j and 2VT2 for i (cid:54)= j. (cid:104)ab|VTS| (cid:101)cd(cid:105) is the antisym-
metrized two body matrix element of the tensor interaction in the quasiparticle basis
and Λ(i) is the density matrix of isospin i. X ij
α,β is symmetric in its subshell/isospin
indices: X ij
β,α. In the Appendix, Hartree-Fock calculations are performed on
some selected nuclei. In this case the quantity X ij
α,β is no longer isospin dependent
and reduces to a sum of two body matrix elements for which the particles run over
the subshells under consideration:

α,β = X ji

α,β = Xα,β =

(cid:104)ab|VTS| (cid:101)ab(cid:105) .

(13)

Calculations are done to determine the Xα,β for subshells from the 1d5/2 to the 2p1/2
one. It is shown in the Appendix that Xα,β is positive when α and β get the same spin
quantum number and is negative in the opposite conﬁguration. Within a doublet
{α, β} the order of magnitude is the same for all the terms Xα,α ∼ Xβ,β ∼ −Xα,β

8

though the cross term absolute value is slightly smaller. Although most of the nuclei
of Table 1 get pairing these Hartree-Fock properties enable to explain the tensor
energy contributions qualitatively.

In Table 1 the simplest cases are 40Ca and 80Zr, two N = Z nuclei for which the
pairing is zero. The tensor energy comes from two spin-orbit saturated subshells:
1d3/2 with 1d5/2 and 2d1/2 with 2d3/2 respectively. In this case it is shown in the
Appendix that the lp and pn components are built from the same sum of matrix
elements:

ETS(i − j) = Vij

(cid:104)

Xα,α + 2 Xα,β + Xβ,β

(cid:105)

.

(14)

Consequently their energies in Table 1 only diﬀer from each other by their respective
parameters given in Eq. (2): VT1 + VT2 = −20 MeV for the lp cases and VT2 = +115
MeV for the pn one. Besides 60Ca is also a SS/SS nucleus but for which the proton
and neutron subshells involved are diﬀerent. Like-particle contributions are also
driven by Eq. (14). As expected the value of ETS(p − p), −0.001 MeV, is similar
to the 40Ca one. However 60Ca gets a non zero neutron pairing which modiﬁes the
ETS(n − n) value from the corresponding p − p or n − n ones in 80Zr, but stays small
(−0.057 MeV). The value of ETS(p − n) for 60Ca, composed by two attractive and
two repulsive X is expected to be small. We get:

ETS(p − n) = Vpn

(cid:104)
X pn

1d5/2,1f7/2

1d5/2,1f5/2

+ X pn

1d3/2,1f7/2

+ X pn

1d3/2,1f5/2

(cid:105)

= +0.027 MeV.(15)

As a result, the p−n contribution partially cancels the n−n one and the total tensor
energy is slightly attractive, contrary to 40Ca and 80Zr.

For nuclei of SS/SU type in Table 1 (34Si, 48Ca, 90Zr and 78Sr) the total tensor
energy is always attractive. The three ﬁrst nuclei are in the same conﬁguration where
the p−n contribution is repulsive and the total energy is dominated by the attractive
SU subshell. Their like-particle SU energy ETS(i − i) is directly proportional to a
X ii

α,α term and ETS(p − n) writes:

α,β and X pn

ETS(p − n) = 2 VT2

α,β + X pn
where X pn
α,γ get opposite signs. It explains qualitatively the fact that the
absolute value of ETS(p − n) is an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding
one of the SS subshell energy. The case of 78Sr is diﬀerent because we need to take
into account the 2p3/2 subshell for the p − p and p − n contributions. We have

In the latter equation we expect all the X on the ﬁrst line give a positive contribution
(same spin for both subshells) and all the X on the second line give a negative
contribution. Here ETS(p − n) is attractive, with a value of −0.069 MeV. At the
Hartree-Fock level most of the X involved in Eq. (17) are much smaller than the
ones for 34Si, 48Ca, 90Zr in Eq. (16) as depicted in Table 11, and this value for 78Sr
falls to −0.011 MeV.

The last type of conﬁguration occurs when both neutron and proton subshells
are spin unsaturated (SU/SU). Here the tensor energy can be either attractive or
repulsive. Like 40Ca and 80Zr, 36Ar is a N = Z nucleus and the ratio between
the diﬀerent contributions also reﬂects the parameters but two orders of magnitude
bigger than the doubly SS nuclei. This is due to the fact that the 1d3/2 subshell is
half full.

As for 78Sr we need here to take into account the fact that the 2p and 1f shells
are mixed for 60Ni and 88Sr. These nuclei look more like SU/SS nuclei because their
valence 1f5/2 subshell is saturated, even if the 2p3/2 subshell must be considered
without its partner in the tensor energy calculations. As expected ETS(p − p) from
78Sr and 88Sr are very close. The 88Sr total tensor energy is dominated by the
attractive ETS(n − n) from neutrons in the 1g9/2 subshell. Contributions X pn
1f7/2,1g9/2
and X pn
term
drive the pn tensor energy. For 60Ni the repulsive pn contributions dominates the
total tensor energy like a SU/SS nucleus. However we would expect from Hartree-
Fock calculations in the Appendix to have a n − n energy more attractive than the
p − p one. This has to be related to the important pairing energy (−9.517 MeV with
D1ST2a) for 60Ni in its spherical state.

should approximately cancel each other and let the X pn

1f5/2,1g9/2

Finally the neutron rich doubly spin-saturated 108Zr diﬀers from the usual SS/SS
case. Here, whereas the ETS(p − p) value p − p energy is equal to the 80Zr case,
as expected, the ETS(n − n) value is much bigger than what we expect from a SS
conﬁguration. This can be partially due to the strong neutron pairing energy, about
−14.627 MeV. When the pairing is oﬀ the ETS(n − n) value falls from ETS(n − n) =
−0.262 MeV to ETS(n − n) = −0.071 MeV.

3.2 Zirconium chain

In Fig. 1 are depicted the PEC for Zirconium isotopes. E is the HFB energy and
q20 the total quadrupole moment variable. This chain has a proton spin-saturated
conﬁguration. We choose to restrict the Zr chain for isotopes from A = 100 to
A = 116 to focus on the region where several minima (oblate/spherical/prolate)
are in competition. PEC obtained using D1S and D1ST2a interactions are quite

diﬀerent. Whereas the D1ST2a interaction is globally less attractive than the D1S
one, the results are diﬀerent around sphericity: D1ST2a calculations give a more
bound nucleus in the spherical minima from A = 100 up to A = 106 and the
tensor eﬀect becomes negligible at sphericity from A > 106. Besides the prolate
minima is always high in energy for D1ST2a whereas it can be the ground state
for D1S (Z = 102, 104, 106). For A > 110 the spherical minima is more and more
dominating for both D1S and D1ST2a. In Table 2 we show the values of the intrinsic
quadrupole moment Q0 for these isotopes, for the ﬁrst minimum (ground state) and
the second one (isomere state). We see that all the nuclei considered present a zero
value for the intrinsic quadrupole moment in the case of the D1ST2a interaction for
the ground state. Both interactions provide very diﬀerent results up to A = 110:
the ﬁrst two minima are spherical and oblate for the D1ST2a interaction and are

3.2.1 Like-particle and proton-neutron contributions

The contribution of the tensor interaction can be decomposed into two parts: the like-
particle one and the proton-neutron one as explained in Section 2.2. The calculations
achieved with the appropriate set of parameters are presented in Fig. (2): the lp and
pn contributions use the parameters deﬁned in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), respectively. All
of them are done in a self-consistent way.

T1 and V pn

T2 . Its eﬀect is slightly attractive (V lp

For all the Zirconium isotopes the pn part dominates the eﬀect of the tensor
interaction. It is always repulsive and reproduces the trend of the D1ST2a curve for
each Zr isotope. On the other hand the lp PEC is very close to the D1S one. Here
the only non zero parameter is V lp
T1 = −20 MeV and is an order of magnitude smaller
than V pn
T1 is negative) and is practically
constant all over the nine isotopes. It is worth to emphasize that the situation is
quite diﬀerent around sphericity. The pn part is zero (the D1S and pn curves are
superimposed) for all the isotopes whereas the lp part remains slightly repulsive
for the lighest isotopes (A < 108) before vanishing (A ≥ 108) and increasing for
A ≥ 112. Here we use the numbers of the Zr isotopes in Table 1. The Zr chain
is proton spin-saturated. For the ﬁrst one, 100Zr, the 2d5/2 subshell becomes to be
ﬁlled with two neutrons. The pn contribution to the tensor energy is negligible and
the n − n attractive part dominates the tensor energy as for the 90Zr case. Then the
subshells are ﬁlled up to N = 68 where the 2d3/2 is full, which makes 108Zr a doubly
spin-saturated nucleus. The main contribution to the tensor energy then comes from
the n − n part as suggested by the 108Zr energy decomposition in Table 1. The next

isotope, 110Zr, also doubly spin-saturated, is similar to 108Zr. Then ﬁlling the 1h11/2
susbshell the pn part increases slightly but the total tensor energy remains attractive.

3.2.2 Particle number ﬂuctuation and densities

In Fig. 3 we show the proton and neutron ﬂuctuations numbers obtained for the
ground state for all Zirconium isotopes from A = 100 to A = 116. Red squares are
the D1ST2a results and black circles are the D1S ones. On the other hand, green
triangles up are the results considering only the lp part of the tensor interaction,
and blue triangles down are those considering only the pn part. It is interesting to
note that in what respect to proton ﬂuctuations, we ﬁnd practically zero for all the
isotopes, using the D1ST2a interaction. With the D1S one, we ﬁnd a non zero value

On
the other hand, the neutron ﬂuctuations are always higher for the D1ST2a case, and
from A = 112 the results for D1S and D1ST2a are practically the same. This can be
related with the fact that the ground state obtained with the interaction D1ST2a is
always spherical, and in the case of the D1S one, only from A = 112 is spherical.

Concerning the lp and pn results we see that the lp part gives very similar results
to D1ST2a ones for both protons and neutrons. On the other hand the pn points are
much closer to the D1S ones. This can be related to the fact that the ground state
locations are most of the time the same for the lp (pn) curve and the D1ST2a (D1S)
one in Fig. 2. For A > 110 almost all the ground states are spherical and the tensor
energy contributions are small (see Fig. 2). Consequently the results are similar for
A > 110. Only the lp part for A = 112 gets a prolate ground state associated to a
small neutron number ﬂuctuation.

Figure 3: Proton and neutron particle number ﬂuctuation for the Z = 40 chain.

In Fig. 4 and 5 we plot the neutron and proton densities for some Zr isotopes
along the symetry axis z. Densities obtained with D1S and D1ST2 are very diﬀerent
because minima for both interactions have not the same deformation character (see
Table 2).

Magnesium PEC are presented in Fig. 6 from A = 20 to A = 40. Some of the
nuclei presented below (28Mg, 30Mg, etc) are soft against the quadrupole moment
coordinate. Therefore beyond mean ﬁeld theories would be more appropriate to
describe them. Since the tensor interaction may modify at the mean ﬁeld level the
PEC in an important way, we choose to present all the even-even isotopes in the
A=20 to 40 interval regardless its structure properties. For the Magnesium chain
the contribution of the tensor term is always repulsive, except for the N = 8 isotope
for which it is negligible. This is due to the fact that N = 8 is a saturated shell,
and then, tensor contributions coming from neutrons are zero. Even for the nucleus
32Mg, namely another neutron saturated shell, we see that the contribution of tensor
terms is negligible in the minimum region. For these two nuclei ETS(p − p) and
ETS(p − n) compensate each other. Moreover another striking feature of Fig. 6 is
the independence of tensor energy with respect to the quadrupole deformation. This
occurs for a majority of the Magnesium isotopes namely from N = 8 to N = 12 and
from N = 22 to N = 28. For N = 14 the prolate ground state with D1S becomes
oblate with D1ST2a. For the two next nuclei N = 16, 18 D1ST2a produces a two
minima well whereas D1S PEC are ﬂat.

proportional by a factor 2 according to Eq. (9) and give an oblate deformation for
both nuclei in each experiment. On the contrary the K = 0 assumption changes the
sign of Q0 with respect to the K = 2 expectation and gives prolate shapes. Following
the empirical rule that we get I = K for the band head we could exclude the value
K = 2. In Table 4 we see that the D1S interaction predicts a prolate ground state
for A = 24 and an oblate one for A = 26. On the other hand D1ST2a interaction
provides prolate ground states, it predicts the same shapes than the experimental
results with K = 0.

In Fig. 7 we plot proton, neutron and total particle number ﬂuctuations obtained
for the ground state in the chain Z = 12, using the D1S interaction (solid line)
and the D1ST2a one (red dashed line). In this case, the total ﬂuctuation is very
similar for both interactions, with the only exception of 30Mg. For 26Mg the total
particle number ﬂuctuations are equal for both interactions, whereas the ground
state locations are inverted. Here the none zero neutron contribution for the D1S
interaction is compensated by the proton contribution of the D1ST2a one. For nuclei
with non zero pairing correlations, where no inversion occurs, the D1ST2a interaction
lowers the particle number ﬂuctuation. Taking into account that deformation does
not change for the ground state, using D1S or D1ST2a interaction (except for 26Mg
and 30Mg), it seems to exist a relation between particle ﬂuctuation and the intrinsic
quadrupole moment (i.e. deformation) of the nuclear state: if particle ﬂuctuations
are similar with both interactions, deformation does not change.

17

3.3.1 26Mg and 30Mg

We study here in more detail two isotopes of the Z = 12 chain. In Fig. 8 we show the
PEC for 26Mg and 30Mg, using the D1S interaction (black circles) and the D1ST2a
one (red squares). We show too the results considering only the like-particle part of
the tensor interaction (green triangles up) or the proton-neutron part (blue triangles
down). This last curve and the corresponding to the D1ST2 interaction are very
close for all the nuclei, showing that the main tensor contribution is that coming
from the pn part. Then, we obtain the same conclusions than for the Zirconium
chain: the pn part dominates the tensor term. Here both pn and lp contributions
are almost deformation independent. For 30Mg the D1S and lp PEC are very ﬂat,
all the states from q20 = −60 fm2 to q20 = +60 fm2 are almost degenerated and the
location of the lp ground state diﬀers (q20 = +16 fm2) from the D1S one (q20 = +60
fm2). Two distinct minima appears when adding the tensor around q20 = −70 fm2
and q20 = +63 fm2 for both D1ST2a and the pn part.

We observe in Fig. 9 that the proton and neutron densities are modiﬁed when
using the D1ST2a interaction with respect to the result for the D1S one in the case
of nuclei 26Mg and 30Mg because the ground state obtained for each interaction has
diﬀerent deformation characteristics. On the contrary for all the other Magnesium
isotopes, where the D1ST2a interaction does not invert the ground state location,
the densities are scarcely modiﬁed.

In Fig. 10 are depicted the Silicon PEC from A = 24 to A = 44. The intrinsic
quadrupole moment of their two ﬁrst minima are presented in Table 5. The tensor
interaction is always repulsive except for A = 34 around q20 = 0 fm2 and at large
deformation for the heaviest isotopes A ≥ 40. For 34Si, which is neutron spin-
saturated, the tensor contribution is slightly attractive and is mainly due to its p − p
part (ETS(p − p) = −0.792 MeV, ETS(tot) = −0.675 MeV). In a general way the D1S
and D1ST2a minima may diﬀer along the chain. All the Silicon isotopes are spherical
or oblate with D1S except 38Si. Among the eleven isotopes the D1ST2a interaction
changes the nucleus shape for two of them: 30S and 40Si. They are globally more
deformed with the D1ST2a interaction. For 30Si the D1S interaction gives a ﬂat well
around sphericity and the D1ST2a one predicts a well located oblate ground state
(Q0 = −0.54 eb). For 40Si the prolate and oblate minima are reversed comparing
the two interactions and the D1ST2a interaction predicts more deformed minima.

The proton pairing is zero for the spherical and oblate ground state for both
interactions, as we can see in Fig. 11. Non zero proton number ﬂuctuation values
are associated to prolate shapes. In the neutron side the D1ST2a curve only roughly
get the same trend than the D1S one since the D1S and D1ST2a potential energy
landscapes may diﬀer a lot. As for the Mg chain, when both interactions give the
same deformation the particle number ﬂuctuation is most of the time smaller with
the D1ST2a one.

3.4.1 30Si and 40Si

Figure 12: Like-particle and proton-neutron contributions of the D1ST2a interaction

In Fig. 12 we plot the lp (green triangles up) and pn (blue triangles down) parts of
the interaction D1ST2a, comparing with the D1S (black circles) and the full D1ST2a
(red squares) ones. As for the other chains, lp and D1S results, on one hand, and pn
and D1ST2a, on the other hand, are very similar. This shows again that the pn part
is the main contribution of the tensor part, for all the deformations. It is interesting
to note that in general, the contribution of the tensor interaction is less in the regime
of high prolate deformations.

In Fig. 13 we show the ground state proton and neutron densities obtained using

state is oblate for the D1S interaction and prolate for the D1ST2a one.

3.4.2 Slater approximation

Figure 14: Potential Energy Curves for the Si isotopes for the D1S interaction (black

D1ST2+ Slater approximation (blue triangles down).

As it is shown before the changes of the ground state localization in PEC can be
assigned to the tensor force. They can also result from the commonly used Slater
approximation on the Coulomb term. Alongside the tensor study we analyze the
impact of the Slater approximation on the Coulomb term all over the Si chain. As
expected it barely modiﬁes the PEC. However these small diﬀerences are big enough
to change the 24Si and 36Si ground states for the D1ST2a interaction. We show in
Fig. 14 the PEC computed with both interactions using the Slater approximation
for the Coulomb exchange term for these latter nuclei. It is compared with the one

calculation). The Slater approximation generally reproduces the same trend than
the exact calculation. For the ﬁrst isotope the PEC depicts a two minima landscape.
For the D1S interaction with exact or approximated Coulomb term the ground state
is predicted oblate. On the other hand considering the Coulomb term at the Slater
approximation with the D1ST2a interaction the ground state moves from the oblate
minimum to the prolate one. For 36Si the Slater approximation moves the ground
state location from sphericity to a prolate shape with the D1ST2a interaction.

3.4.3 The D1ST2c parameterization

The D1ST2a parameterization chosen for this study keeps the spin-orbit parameter
of the Gogny interaction unchanged. This choice is supported by the fact that we
aim to analyze and isolate as well as possible the eﬀect of the tensor term in the
deformation. However as already mentionned above another parameterization called
D1ST2c has been published in the literature [28]. In this latter the adjustment of
the spin-orbit and tensor parameters is done in three steps keeping all the other
ones unchanged from the D1S parameterization. First the spin-orbit parameter is
set looking at the neutron splitting 1f in 40Ca for which the tensor force vanishes.
Then the like-particle VT1 + VT2 tensor parameter is determined by the ﬁt of the
neutron splitting 1f in 48Ca. Finally the unlike VT 2 parameter is adjusted by looking
at the same splitting in 56Ni. The intention of [28] is to give acceptable signs and
boundaries for the tensor parameters. It worth stressing out that these adjustments
are done at the HF level. In Table 6 are reminded the parameters of interest.

Table 6: Reﬁtted parameters (MeV) for D1ST2a and D1ST2c.

The D1ST2a and D1ST2c PEC are compared in Fig. 15 for the Silicon isotopes.
The minima in the D1ST2c PEC are located at the same quadrupole deformation
than the ones obtained with D1ST2a. The nuclei are less bound with the D1ST2c
parameterization, by about 2 MeV along the Silicon chain. The D1ST2a and D1ST2c
curves get the same variations in all the PEC, except for the 28,30Si isotopes around
sphericity. For these two nuclei the valence shell, the 1d5/2 and 2s1/2 respectively,
are full. The 1d5/2 subshell partner is empty and we expect the tensor contribution

25

to be important according to the schematic arguments presented in Sec. 3.1. An-
other interesting Si isotope is the neutron SS 34Si. At sphericity the tensor energy
only comes from the p − p contribution and the pairing vanishes for both parame-
terizations. The ratio between the tensor energy from D1ST2a and from D1ST2c is
about 0.239 very close to the expected value (0.267) in the schematic tensor energy
decomposition in Sec. 3.1. This also applies for the spin-orbit energies: 1.281 close
to W a
LS (cid:39) 1.262. The total HFB energy diﬀerence ((cid:39) −1.77 MeV) between
D1ST2a and D1ST2c is not only due to the spin-orbit plus tensor energy diﬀerence
((cid:39) 6.45 MeV); all the contributions to the total HFB energy are rearranged by the
D1ST2c ﬁt. This is generally true all along the chain.

We present the Sulfur PEC in Fig. 16 and the associated two ﬁrst minima Q0 obtained
with D1S and D1ST2a in Table 7. In this chain there is an important impact of the
tensor term on the PEC. D1ST2a modiﬁes the ground state location for several
nuclei. With the D1S interaction all the isotopes are found to be either spherical or
prolate. For the lighest isotopes (up to A = 38) and the two last ones (A = 48, 50)
the D1S curve describes a ﬂat well. Two of them are prolate (A = 28, 32) even if the
well is centered around their nascent second minimum at q20 = 0 fm2, and the rest
of the them are spherical. For 40 ≤ A ≤ 46 the D1S PEC gives two distinct oblate
and prolate minima.

Table 7: Theoretical Q0(eb) for the Z = 16 chain.

Using the D1ST2a interaction, we observe signiﬁcative changes in the PEC. It
tends to eliminate the one-minimum ﬂat well produced by D1S to a two-minima
landscape. Two of the lightest isotopes become prolate with the D1ST2a interaction:
30S and 34S. Besides, the ground state location is changed for the four last isotopes:
all of them become oblate with the D1ST2a interaction from a prolate (A = 44, 46)
or spherical (A = 48, 50) D1S conﬁguration. Moreover, 36S is a special case because
it is neutron spin-saturated. As expected here the tensor energy becomes negligible
in its spherical ground state.

In Fig. 17 we show the particle number ﬂuctuations of the Sulfur isotopes. The

28

main diﬀerences are found where the ground state location are diﬀerent for both
proton and neutron ﬂuctuations. For the total particle number ﬂuctuations, the
behaviour is more or less the same up to A = 44, that is, the D1ST2a interaction
slightly lowering the ﬂuctuations when the ground state shapes are similar, except
for the nucleus 30S, for which remains the diﬀerence obtained for the proton case.
For this latter nucleus, we present in Fig. 18 the PEC, with the lp (green triangles
up) and pn (blue triangles down) tensor contributions separately. We see again that
the main contribution is coming from the pn part, because it is very similar to the
result using the full D1ST2a interaction (red squares).

In Fig. 19 we show the PEC for the nucleus 44S, using both interactions and
considering or not the Slater approximation for the exchange Coulomb term. We
see that the ground state does not change in the case of the D1ST2a interaction,
but considering the D1S one, the ground state is prolate for the exact treatment
of the exchange Coulomb term and oblate when the Slater approximation is used.
Then, this is the reason to obtain diﬀerent proton and neutron distributions for both
interactions when Slater approximation is considered in the calculations, as we show
in Fig. 20, lower panels.

In Fig. 21 we plot the PEC for Argon isotopes. We can see that the eﬀect of tensor
interaction onto these curves is not very important. It does not change the ground
state and the possible isomere. It is worth to note the nascent two-minima well for
D1ST2a in 40Ar which arises for D1S from A ≥ 42.

For 36Ar both interactions predict an oblate ground state.

In Table 9 we see
that the spectroscopic quadrupole moment gives an oblate shape for 36Ar only when
K = 0. The experimental Q0 value −0.39 eb is then very close to the theoretical
ones (both at −0.43 eb). For 40Ar the experimental Q0 gives an spherical ground
state, as predicted by the D1S interaction. With the D1ST2a one, the ground state is
slightly prolate. However for this nucleus the D1ST2a well is rather ﬂat and centered
around sphericity as the D1S one. Thus the ground state shape is sensitive to any
modiﬁcation of the PEC.

Ground states and ﬁrst isomeres Q0 are given in Table 10. D1S and D1ST2a PEC
get at least two minima along the chain: a prolate one and a slightly oblate one. A
nascent spherical minimum may arise for A ≤ 104 or for A ≥ 110 for the D1ST2a
interaction.

Figure 22: Potential Energy Curves of the Z = 38 chain for the D1S interaction
(black circles) and D1ST2a one (red squares).

The D1S curves get a pronounced prolate minimum from A = 98 to A = 108
which is the ground state of these Strontium isotopes. On the contrary for the ﬁrst
(A = 96) and the two last isotopes A = 110, 112 the ground state is oblate.
In
a general way, for the D1ST2a interaction the prolate minimum is always high in
energy, about 5 MeV above the D1S minimum as for the Zr chain, whereas the
energies obtained with both interactions are similar at sphericity and at the oblate

Around sphericity this chain gets a special proton SU conﬁguration due
to the mixing of the 2p and 1f subshells. Indeed the proton subshells are ﬁlled up
to the valence 1f5/2 one, including the 1f7/2 and 2p3/2 ones, and the 2p1/2 subshell
is empty. The Sr PEC can be compared to the Zr ones in Fig. 1 for which the
proton 2p1/2 subshell is also full. Around q20 = 0 fm2 the tensor energy is small and
repulsive or negligible along the Sr chain whereas it is attractive for the neutron SU
Zr isotopes. This directly highlights the impact of the 2p1/2 on the p − n and p − p
contributions to the tensor energies. For prolate deformations the tensor energy is
strongly repulsive for both chains.
In this region the tensor energy is dominated
by the strongly repulsive p − n contribution. Consequently the D1ST2a interaction
reverses the ground state for all the nuclei that D1S predicts to be prolate namely
from A = 98 to A = 108.

In Fig. 23 we only have plotted the neutron particle number ﬂuctuations for both
interactions. There is no proton pairing for all the D1ST2a oblate ground states.
The only two Strontium isotopes which get a small proton pairing at their ground
states with the D1S interaction are A= 96 and A= 110, and they are the only nuclei
with oblate deformation in the chain with A= 112. On the other hand, for neutrons,
the ﬂuctuation number is bigger using the D1ST2a interaction. It is interesting to

4 Conclusions

In this paper we studied the tensor interaction in deformed nuclei within the Hartree-
Fock-Bogoliubov theory. The D1ST2a Gogny interaction used here is built from the
D1S Gogny interaction to which is added a ﬁnite range tensor term [23]. We focused
our work on the Mg, Si, S, Ar, Sr and Zr chains looking at the potential energy
curves with respect to the quadrupole deformation moment variable and ground
states properties. We found that the D1ST2a interaction is globally more repulsive
than the D1S one along the PEC even if it can vanish or become attractive in
some cases. When two PEC minima are close in energy, D1ST2a interaction can
invert the minima order and thus modify the ground state shape. Consequently the
ground states densities and particle number ﬂucuations can change drastically. When
no inversion occurs the pairing tends towards slightly weakening with the D1ST2a
interaction, and the particle number ﬂuctuation follows the same trend than the D1S
one.

The range of the D1ST2a tensor term was chosen as the longest one of the D1S
parametrizations and the two remaining parameters of the tensor term were adjusted
on speciﬁc structure properties [23]. Modifying these latter parameters enable us to
decompose the tensor contribution to the HFB energy to a like-particle part and a
proton-neutron part. We analyzed these two contributions along the PEC: the like-
particle part is attractive and most of the time the total tensor energy is dominated
by the repulsive proton-neutron part of the tensor term.

In general the tensor contribution behaves in a diﬀerent way around sphericity and
well deformed shapes. The way the tensor term contributes to the total HFB energy
is driven by the ﬁlling of the valence subshells and their spin-orbit partners. Within
a spin-orbit doublet there are three diﬀerent contributions to the tensor energy: the
one where both particles are in the lower subshell, the one where both particles
are in the higher subshell and the case where particles are in distinct subshells.
Regardless of the parameters signs the two ﬁrst ones gives a positive contribution
and the last one gives a negative contribution in such a way that when both subshells
are completely ﬁlled the three contributions cancel each other. More generally for
the proton-neutron energy the sign of the contribution to the energy is given by the
spins signs assigned to the subshells within the shell model picture. For two subshells
in the same position in their respective spin-orbit doublet the tensor energy will be
positive; when both spins are diﬀerent, the tensor will be attractive. As a result for

37

SS/SS the tensor energy vanishes.

When one of the subshells is not spin-saturated (SS/SU case) the PEC become
completely diﬀerent. In this conﬁguration the tensor energy is either attractive or
negligible around sphericity. Here the like-particle energy from the spin-saturated
subshell is negligible. The proton-neutron contribution reduces drastically from the
one of its SU/SU neighbors and the SU like-particle energy becomes the dominant
attractive contribution, or at least compensate the proton-neutron one.

For SU/SU nuclei several situations may arise. The most probable case occurs
when the tensor term is the most important around spherical shape and decrease at
larger deformation (oblate and prolate sides). In contrast the tensor energy is almost
deformation independent in some isotopes of the Mg chain. It occurs for isotopes
which begin the ﬁlling of the proton p and sd shells and such a behaviour, speciﬁc to
the Mg chain, is not reproduce for the next opened or closed proton subshell (Si, S
and Ar chains). Finally the case of the Strontium chain is diﬀerent. The inversion of
the 1f5/2 and 2p3/2 subshell makes the Sr looks more like a SS subshell than a classic
SU one.

Summarizing, we can conclude that the tensor interaction can modify in an im-
portant way the deformation properties of some nuclei. Then, it is possible to use
observables related with deformation in order to test diﬀerent interactions including
tensor. One of the most important features dealing with the tensor interaction in
eﬀective ﬁeld theory is the fact that the major eﬀect of the bare tensor interaction is
already included in the central term of the eﬀective interaction. In addition whereas
light nuclei, such as deuteron, bring information about the bare tensor force, the
diﬃculty to isolate the eﬀect of the tensor force from the other terms of the eﬀective
interaction arises for medium-mass or heavy nuclei. With the present study we aim
to bring additional information on the eﬀective tensor force to achieve a global ﬁt of
the Gogny interaction with a complete built-in tensor force. We have considered the
D1ST2a parameterization, for which the spin-orbit strength does not change with
respect to the D1S Gogny interaction, because we are interested in the analyzis and
the isolation of the eﬀect of the tensor term in the deformation as well as possible.
This study is a preliminar work in order to highlight regions where tensor contri-
butions are important. A reﬁt of all the parameters of the Gogny + full tensor
eﬀective interaction is required. An overall ﬁt of this new eﬀective Gogny interaction
would aim to improve the deﬁciencies in spin-orbit splitting in exotic neutron rich
nuclei. However the tensor force eﬀect is not the unique feature responsible for the
variations in the single particle energies which makes its inclusion in the eﬀective in-
teraction delicate. For instance the spin-orbit coupling may be reduced by neutrons
skin appearance, or in the light nuclei the interaction between bound orbitals and

38

continuum states can modify the energy gaps. The D1S parameterization fails to
reproduce the N = 20 single particle energy spectra in exotic nuclei in the O, Ne, or
Mg chains [43, 44, 45, 46]; one would expect some improvement from a new Gogny +
tensor parameterization on that matter. Besides, since the tensor force may modify
considerably the single particle energies, all the nuclear structure properties can be
aﬀected. One of the main weaknesses of the D1S parameterization is its disability
to correctly reproduce the binding energies all over the nuclide chart, resulting in
particular to the release of the D1M parameterization [42]. The present study shows
that with the tensor inclusion some medium mass nuclei can become more bound
for several MeV at the mean ﬁeld level and completely change their ground state
deformation. It has also been highlighted by Pudlinger [17] that bound energies are
sensitives to the tensor force in lighter nuclei. All these features make a new global
parameterization challenging. Beforehand the importance of the tensor force on odd
nuclei must be analyzed following on from these studies. This is what we plan to do
in the near future. In particular we will focus on the impact of the tensor term in
the odd-even staggering of the binding energy.

.1 Decomposition of the tensor energy contribution in terms

of isospin components

The total tensor energy can be decomposed according to the isospin quantum number
of the particles as:

ETS(tot) = ETS(p − p) + ETS(n − n) + ETS(p − n) + ETS(n − p) ,

(18)

where the isospin dependent energies ETS(i − j) read:

ETS(i − j) = Vij

with (cid:104)ab|V T S| (cid:101)cd(cid:105) the antisymmetrized two body matrix element of the (isospin free)
tensor interaction. In the above equation a and c denotes quasiparticles of isospin
j whereas b and d get an isospin i. The coeﬃcient Vij is determined from Eq. (2):
Vij = VT1 + VT2 when i = j and Vij = VT2 for i (cid:54)= j. Moreover it is straightforward to
show that the two unlike-particle contributions are equal: ETS(p − n) = ETS(n − p).
In the following we redeﬁne for convenience ETS(p − n) as their sum and use the
coeﬃcients Vlp ≡ VT1 + VT2 and Vpn ≡ 2VT2.

In Eq. (19) the quasiparticles indices run over all the states of the quasiparticle
basis of the Fock space. In the following we will assume that the tensor energy comes
from the valence subshell and their spin-orbit partners in the shell model picture. For
instance in the case of 40Ca we will consider only nucleons from the 1d3/2 and 1d1/2
subshells. Furthermore for this nucleus there is no pairing and the density matrices
are identity in the {1d3/2, 1d5/2} subspace: Λ(j)
ca = δca for a, c ∈ {1d3/2, 1d5/2}. Thus
the energy becomes:

These latter properties are in agreement with the numerical numbers of 40Ca in
Table 1. This analysis can be done for all types of nuclei and we will follow in this
appendix to work at the Hartree-Fock level for all nuclei.

In the case of SS/SU nuclei with the same spin-orbit partners for neutron and
proton (such as 34Si), we get for a neutron spin-saturated subshells (α and β full)
and a proton spin-unsaturated subshell (α full and β empty) conﬁguration:

ETS(p − p) = Vlp Xα,α ,
ETS(n − n) = Vlp (Xα,α + Xβ,β + 2Xα,β) ,
ETS(n − p) = Vpn (Xα,α + Xα,β) ,

which leads to



Xα,α = ETS(p − p)/Vlp ,
Xα,β = ETS(p − n)/Vpn − ETS(p − p)/Vlp ,
Xβ,β = ETS(n − n)/Vlp + ETS(p − p)/Vlp − ETS(p − n)/Vpn .

In the pf shell the 1f7/2/1f5/2 and 2p3/2/2p1/2 partners are mixed, that is to say the
2p3/2 subshell is located between the 1f7/2 and 1f5/2 ones. As a result we encounter
in that region conﬁgurations where more than two subshells have to be taken into
account to understand the tensor energy contributions. For instance for 76Sr both
proton and neutron subshells are full up to the 1f5/2 and the tensor energies are:

ETS(p − p) = Vlp

There are several ways to determine most of the Xα,β. For example the X1f7/2,1f7/2
66Ni or
is directly given by ETS(p − p) or ETS(n − n) for
48Ca and so on. Most of the energies mixes several Xα,β which
ETS(n − n) for
means that several energy contributions are necessary to determine some speciﬁc
Xα,β in most cases. The diﬀerent ways to calculate the Xα,β from diﬀerent nuclei
gives slightly diﬀerent numerical values. The average value is then chosen as the
reference value. This latter is presented in Table 11 for all the subshells from the
1d5/2 subshell to the 2p1/2 one except the 2s subshell. In eﬀect the study of nuclei
30Si, 32S and 36S shows that its contributions to the tensor energies are always small
and are consequently neglected. By way of example, some Xα,β values are presented
at the end of this Appendix.

Table 11: Average Xα,β for selected subshells from Hartree-Fock calculations.

Several conclusions can be drawn from Table 11. The ﬁrst one deals with the sign
of the Xα,β. The sign of the Xα,α type is always positive. Within spin-orbit partners
subshells the Xα,β crossed term (α (cid:54)= β) is always negative. In a more general way,
the sign of the Xα,β is determined by the location of the subshells α and β in the
level scheme of the shell model picture: when both spin quantum numbers s(α) and
s(β) are equal, Xα,β is positive and when s(α) (cid:54)= s(β), Xα,β is negative. The only
exception in Table 11 concerns the smallest X value: X1f7/2,2p3/2 = −0.0008.

The second noticeable feature in Table 11 deals with the orders of magnitude.
For a given subshell α, the Xα,α quantity is about ∼ 0.01 and rises with the numbers
of nucleons in the subshell from +0.0112 for 2p3/2 up to +0.0574 for 1f7/2. Moreover
for two spin-orbit partners (α, β) we get Xα,α (cid:39) Xβ,β and Xα,α (cid:39) −Xα,β. As a
result the sum of the tensor energy contributions from spin-orbit partner subshells
are negligible:

Xα,α + Xβ,β + 2 Xα,β =






+0.0001 for α, β = 1d5/2, 1d3/2 ,
+0.0019 for α, β = 1f7/2, 1f5/2 ,
+0.0005 for α, β = 2p3/2, 2p1/2 .

(28)

This can be correlated to the fact that when both subshells are full and are non
valence subshells their contributions to the tensor energy is neglected in our assump-
tion.

Finally as the number of nucleons is small for the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 subshells we
get small crossed Xα,β terms involving one of these subshells and one of the biggest
ones.

.2 Explicit calculation of the Xα,β

Besides we calculate the contributions of the 2s subshell to the tensor energy in
the sd shell. To do so the 2s subshell is explicitly considered in 30Si and 36S. As it
shown below the X involving the 2s subshell are negligible.
