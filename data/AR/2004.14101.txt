We present mass excesses (ME) of neutron-rich isotopes of Ar through Fe, obtained via TOF-
Bρ mass spectrometry at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. Our new results
have signiﬁcantly reduced systematic uncertainties relative to a prior analysis, enabling the ﬁrst
determination of ME for 58,59Ti, 62V, 65Cr, 67,68Mn, and 69,70Fe. Our results show the N = 34
subshell weaken at Sc and vanish at Ti, along with the absence of an N = 40 subshell at Mn. This
leads to a cooler accreted neutron star crust, highlighting the connection between the structure of
nuclei and neutron stars.

The rest mass m is a basic property of an atomic
nucleus, essential for calculating astrophysical processes
such as X-ray burst light curves and r-process nucleosyn-
thesis, and key to mapping the evolution of nuclear struc-
ture across the nuclear landscape [1–3]. While nuclear
masses nearly follow the whole-number rule, m ≈ Amu,
where A is the mass number and mu = 931.49 MeV is
the atomic mass unit, the (cid:46) 1% deviation from this re-
lationship due to nuclear binding is notoriously diﬃcult
to predict. State-of-the-art mass models [e.g. 4–7] often
disagree in their predictions of the atomic mass excess,
ME(Z, A) = m − (Z + N )mu where Z is the proton num-
ber and N is the neutron number, by more than one
MeV. Similar discrepancies are present when comparing
predictions to experimentally measured masses. As such,
experiments mapping the evolution of the nuclear mass
surface across the nuclear landscape are essential.

For neutron-rich nuclides, mass measurements have re-
vealed the emergence and disappearance of the magic
numbers that indicate enhanced nuclear binding [e.g 8–
15]. For instance, N = 34 semi-magicity emerges for
neutron-rich calcium isotopes [14], whereas there are sig-
natures that the N = 40 harmonic oscillator subshell gap
disappears for neutron-rich manganese [16]. While the
evolution of these subshells were mapped by spectroscopy

experiments that often long-preceded the corresponding
mass measurements [e.g. 17–24], nuclear masses provided
the ﬁrst model-independent conﬁrmation of this spectro-
scopic evidence via fundamental ground state properties.

These evolutions in nuclear structure are closely linked
to the thermal structure of accreting neutron stars. Nu-
clei produced by surface burning processes are buried
by subsequent accretion, resulting in a number of nu-
clear reactions in the neutron star crust that drive it
from thermal equilibrium [25]. Electron-capture (EC)
reactions near closed shells result in relatively large EC-
heating due to the large change in the EC Q-value
QEC = ME(Z, A) − ME(Z − 1, A) [26]. EC in regions
of deformation between closed shells occur on isobars
with a small odd-even staggering in QEC as well as low-
lying excited states, which results in the EC-β−-decay
cycling process known as urca cooling [27]. Therefore,
whether EC heating or cooling occurs, and the strength
of the heat source or heat sink, strongly depend on nu-
clear masses [28–30].

To simultaneously map the evolution of the N = 34
and N = 40 subshells and constrain the thermal struc-
ture of accreting neutron stars, we performed mass mea-
surements of neutron-rich isotopes of Ar through Fe
(Z = 18 − 26). First results from these measurements

 
 
 
 
 
 
have been reported in Refs. [10, 29, 30]. The present
work is a re-evaluation of the original data, incorporat-
ing recently published high-precision Penning trap mass
data [12, 13] as additional calibration nuclides, which
greatly reduces the systematic uncertainty present in our
results and greatly expands the number of nuclides for
which masses are obtained. Our results extend the known
nuclear mass surface, provide model-independent conﬁr-
mation of the emergence of N = 34 and disappearance
of N = 40 semimagicity, and signiﬁcantly update predic-
tions for urca cooling in accreted neutron star crusts.

Magnetic-rigidity corrected time-of-ﬂight (TOF-Bρ)
mass measurements were performed at the National Su-
perconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The measurement
technique and measurements are described in detail in
Refs. [10, 29–32] and are only brieﬂy summarized here.
A 140 MeV/nucleon beam of 82Se accelerated by the
coupled cyclotrons impinged on a Be target and the re-
sulting fully-stripped (charge q = Z) fragments were
transmitted through the A1900 fragment separator [33],
momentum-analyzed at the target location of the S800
spectrograph [34], and stopped in the focal plane of the
S800 [35]. Particle identiﬁcation was performed event-
by-event using the TOF-∆E method, where TOF was
provided by fast-timing scintillators separated by a ﬂight
path Lpath = 60.6 m and energy loss ∆E determined us-
ing an ionization chamber. A relative measurement of
Bρ, which is the momentum over q, was obtained via a
position measurement using a microchannel plate detec-
tor located at the dispersive focus of the S800 [36, 37].

Nominally, m = (TOF/Lpath)(qBρ/γ), where γ is the
Lorentz factor. However, determining Lpath and Bρ to
suﬃcient precision is not practicable.
Instead, an em-
pirical relationship between m/q and TOF is determined
from a ﬁt to nuclides of known m which are simulta-
neously measured alongside nuclides of interest. This
work improves on prior results [10, 29, 30] by including
seven additional calibration nuclides, bringing the total
to 27. High-precision ME for 59−63Cr [13] and 54,55Ti [12]
substantially improve constraints on the m/q(TOF) re-
lationship, whose ambiguity previously provided one of
the dominant contributions to our ME uncertainties [30].
Mass ﬁts were performed as described in Ref. [30]. Sev-

eral ﬁt functions were explored, of the form

m
q

(τ ) = a0 + a1τ + a2z + a3τ 2 + a4z2 + a5zτ + f (z, τ ),

where τ = TOF − (cid:104)TOF(cid:105), z = Z − (cid:104)Z(cid:105), and f (z, τ )
is a function of higher-order in z and/or τ . The addi-
tion of the new Ti and Cr reference nuclides resolved
the previously existing ambiguity in the Z-dependence,
while the Cr masses additionally clariﬁed that a higher-
order TOF component was needed to adequately min-
imize ﬁt residuals, which are shown for the best-ﬁt in
Fig. 1. The best-ﬁt function has f (z, τ ) = a6z3 + a7τ 4,
whereas a ﬁt of slightly lower quality was obtained with

2

f (z, τ ) = a6z3 + a7τ 3. This set of acceptable functions
was determined by the following criterion.
(1) The ﬁt
residuals must lack systematic trends. (2) The ﬁt resid-
uals must be robust to the arbitrary removal of reference
nuclides. (3) The diﬀerence between χ2 for a ﬁt function
and the best-ﬁt ∆χ2
i − χ2
min must be within three
(cid:46) 37), which is a
standard deviations of the best-ﬁt (∆χ2
i
valid metric based on the Gaussian distribution of the ﬁt
parameters after repeated ﬁts varying ME for reference
nuclides in a Monte Carlo procedure [30, 38].

The smaller number and closer similarity of the set
of acceptable functions substantially reduce the ﬁt-
function uncertainty relative to the previous evalua-

2.452.52.552.62.652.7A/Z1500-1000-500-05001000 [keV]literature-MfitM444546474748495051495051525354545559606162636365666466Z=18Z=19Z=20Z=22Z=24Z=25Z=26283032343638404244N468101214 [MeV]2nSClArKCaScTiVCrMnFeCotion [30]. Additional uncertainty contributions come
from the 9.1 keV/q systematic uncertainty added to all
nuclides to normalize the reduced χ2 to one for the best-
ﬁt and the uncertainty in ai due to TOF uncertainties in
the reference nuclides. See Ref. [30] for details.

Our resultant ME are reported in Tabs. I and II with
comparisons to literature values and results from our pre-
vious evaluation, where Fig. 2 shows the two neutron sep-
aration energy S2n(Z, A) = 2ME(0, 1) + ME(Z, A − 2) −
ME(Z, A). All but one of our updated ME are within
1 standard deviation σ of our previous ME and all are
within 2σ, while the majority of uncertainties have been
reduced by a factor of two. We report ME for 58,59Ti,
62V, 65Cr, 67,68Mn, and 69,70Fe for the ﬁrst time.

The new trend in S2n for V is largely due to 58,59V,
which are much less bound in our work compared to
the 2016 AME evaluated result, but in agreement with
the privately communicated results Ref. [39] refers to as
1998Ba.A that were included in that evaluation. The ab-
normal behavior for Fe in S2n shown in Fig. 2 is diﬃcult
to understand in terms of nuclear structure eﬀects, since
a new single-particle orbital is not expected to be ﬁlled.
Additionally, anomalous behavior of m/q(TOF) is an un-
likely explanation, since the function is smooth in that
region and a similar feature is not seen for nearby Z. 67Fe
is known to have an isomeric state at 387 keV [42], which,
along with measurement uncertainties, may explain the
∼ 1 MeV deviation in S2n from a smooth trend. We
suspect 69Fe may also have a long-lived isomer based on
the presence of such states in odd-A isotopes of Fe due to
intrusion from the νg9/2 orbital [43]. The kink at N = 39
for Cr agrees with the trend calculated using the LNPS’
Hamiltonian [13, 30, 44], but the absolute S2n are dis-
crepant.

ME for N = 36 isotopes of Sc, Ti, and V can be used to
deduce the evolution of N = 34 in this region. Ref. [14]
demonstrated the presence of N = 34 semi-magicity for
Ca, whereas spectroscopy has indicated this subshell clo-
sure is absent for Ti and likely weakened for Sc, with the
caveat that E(2+
1 ) energies can provide ambiguous con-
straints on shell gaps [45]. Our data reveal a continuous
slope in S2n for Ti following N = 34, while Sc trends
slightly more negative beyond this point. This indicates
that a weak N = 34 subshell gap is present at Sc.

Further insight is provided by the trend in Dn(Z, A) =
(−1)N +1[Sn(Z, A + 1) − Sn(Z, A)], which is related to
the empirical pairing gap [46]. Dn is proportional to the
number of angular momentum projection states (2j + 1)
participating in pairing, providing a signature of gaps in
single particle levels. Fig. 3(a) shows the trend in Dn
near N = 34 for isotopes of Ca through V. While the
dip after N = 34 for the Sc isotopes might initially ap-
pear to be the signature of a signiﬁcant shell gap, shell
model calculations suggest this is not the case. Calcu-
lations using the GX1A Hamiltonian [47], whose results
are shown in Fig. 3(b) to be in qualitative agreement

this is an extrapolation and not directly based on experimental data. The I following an isotope indicates a known or suspected
long-lived (> 100 ns) isomeric component. For instance, for 67Fe the known isomer at 387 keV excitation energy is responsible
for the additional asymmetric error bar, while for 69Fe our results should be interpreted as an upper bound.

with experiment, indicate that the particularly low Dn
for 56Sc is due to the large splitting of levels created by
the residual interaction between the πf7/2 and νf5/2 or-
bitals. In particular, the minimum in Dn for Sc is due to
the low-lying J = 1 level created by this interaction. S2n
is not sensitive to this eﬀect as it reﬂects the energetics
of neutron shells and not the strength of proton-neutron
pairing [3, 16]. These results conﬁrm previous indica-
tions from spectroscopy of weak N = 34 magicity for Sc,
while removing the ambiguity inherent to spectroscopic
interpretations of shell structure [18, 20, 45].

N = 40 for Mn, strengthening the conclusions of Ref. [16]
that the N = 40 subshell is absent for this element. This
is bolstered by the trend in Dn shown in Fig. 3(c). Our
data are ambiguous regarding the N = 40 subshell at
Cr, where the mass of 66Cr is needed to conﬁrm prior
spectroscopic and coulomb-excitation evidence [e.g. 23,
48, 49].

The evolution in nuclear structure presented here is
directly linked to the thermal structure of accreting neu-
tron stars. The neutrino luminosity from urca cooling
Lν ∝ X(A)(f t)−1|QEC|5, where f t is the comparative
half-life and X(A) is the mass fraction, and is therefore
very sensitive to changes in ME [50, 51]. This process op-
erates in the accreted neutron star crust with consequen-
tial Lν for odd-A nuclides with X(A) (cid:38) 0.5%, f t (cid:46) 5,
and 8 (cid:46) |QEC| (cid:46) 15 MeV [27, 52], where the upper limit
on QEC is due to competing EC reaction channels [53].
Two EC parents predicted to produce some of the largest
Lν, with potentially observable consequences [51, 52], are
55Sc and 65Mn. For 65Mn, f t will be uncertain by orders
of magnitude until measurements are enabled by next-
generation rare isotope beam facilities, but estimates
from QRPA calculations [27] and using the Moszkowski
nomographs [54] result in log(f t) ≈ 5, allowing signiﬁ-
cant Lν. 55Sc by contrast has more consistent predic-
tions, with log(f t) ≈ 5 using QRPA methods [27], the
Moszkowski nomographs, and empirical systematics [55],
currently making it the highest predicted Lν urca cool-
[52, 56]. Furthermore, a measurement of f t
ing layer
for this transition has recently taken place [57]. For both
A = 55 and 65, X(A) > 0.5% and are remarkably consis-
tent for a wide variety of assumptions for nuclear burning
on the accreting neutron star surface [58]. Therefore QEC
are the ﬁnal piece of the nuclear physics puzzle for these
urca coolers.

Fig. 2 demonstrates a continuous slope in S2n through

Using the newly determined ME(55Sc), |QEC(55Sc)| =

12.44 (0.27) MeV, to be compared to the prior [14, 39]
value 11.51 (0.48) MeV. Our reported ME(65Cr) results
in |QEC(65Mn)| = 13.69 (0.78) MeV, to be compared to
the prior [16, 39] value 12.75 (0.30) MeV (though the lat-
ter uncertainty relies on the AME extrapolation, which
assumes an essentially featureless nuclear mass surface
and may be underestimated). These results increase Lν
by 50% for EC on 55Sc with half the prior uncertainty and
provide the ﬁrst experimental determination of Lν for EC
on 65Mn. While in agreement with previous predictions,
our central value for QEC(65Mn) leads to 40% larger Lν.
Therefore the accreted neutron star crust is cooler than
previously thought, with an improved precision on the
description of the neutron star thermal structure.

In conclusion, this work highlights the intriguing con-
nection between evolution in nuclear structure and the
thermal structure of accreting neutron stars. We ﬁnd
model-independent evidence for the onset of the N = 34
subshell for Sc and the likely absence of N = 40 magicity
for Cr, each of which result in a larger mass diﬀerence
for transitioning from odd-Z to odd-N in EC. This is ul-
timately connected to the strength of the interaction be-
tween a nuclear core and an unpaired proton as opposed
to an unpaired neutron [16, 59], and leads to increas-
ing the phase-space available for the weak transitions in-
volved in urca cooling, which in turn results in a cooler
neutron star crust. Our measurements leave ME(63V)
as the ﬁnal nuclear mass important for urca cooling in
the accreted neutron star crust that relies on theoretical
mass estimates.
