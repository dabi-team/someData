Abstract.
In this paper we estimate the conditional value-at-risk by ﬁtting diﬀerent
multivariate parametric models capturing some stylized facts about multivariate ﬁnan-
cial time series of equity returns: heavy tails, negative skew, asymmetric dependence, and
volatility clustering. While the volatility clustering eﬀect is got by AR-GARCH dynamics
of the GJR type, the other stylized facts are captured through non-Gaussian multivariate
models and copula functions. The CoVaR≤ is computed on the basis on the multivariate
normal model, the multivariate normal tempered stable (MNTS) model, the multivariate
generalized hyperbolic model (MGH) and four possible copula functions. These risk mea-
sure estimates are compared to the CoVaR= based on the multivariate normal GARCH
model. The comparison is conducted by backtesting the competitor models over the time
span from January 2007 to March 2020. In the empirical study we consider a sample of
listed banks of the euro area belonging to the main or to the additional global systemically
important banks (GSIBs) assessment sample.

Key words: systemic risk, value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, heavy tails, non-linear
dependence, copula functions, backtesting.

Introduction

The contribution of ﬁnancial institutions to systemic risks in ﬁnancial markets is a largely
debated topic in literature. Relevant articles include Billio et al. (2012), Adrian and
Brunnermeier (2016), Girardi and Erg¨un (2013), Lin et al. (2018).

In Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) the distress of a ﬁnancial institution is deﬁned as
the event (yj = VaRj
α), where yj is the random variable representing the log-returns of
the ﬁnancial institution j and VaRj
α the corresponding value-at-risk (VaR) at tail level α.
Here we consider the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR≤) measure, that is the conditional
value-at-risk where the conditioning event is the distress of a ﬁnancial institution repre-
sented through the inequality yj ≤ VaRj
α. This allows us to have a robust systemic risk
measure which can be backtested without a great eﬀort (see Girardi and Erg¨un (2013)
and Banulescu et al. (2020)). Conversely the original CoVaR of Adrian and Brunnermeier

(2016) is simple to estimate, as shown in Bianchi and Sorrentino (2020), but not so simple
to backtest.

Assuming that the CoVaR≤ is a proper systemic risk measure, we explore to which
extent the model assumptions on the univariate ﬁnancial institution log-returns and on
the dependence structure aﬀect the estimates of this risk measure. Additional, we conduct
a backtesting analysis to obtain a robust model comparison.

It is widely known that the amplitude of daily returns varies over time and that if
the volatility is high, it tends to remain high, and if it is low, it tends to remain low.
This means that volatility moves in clusters and for this reason it is necessary to capture
such observed behaviour (Rachev et al. (2011)). Additionally the CoVaR estimation is
by deﬁnition a multi-dimensional problem. The multivariate normal model is usually
applied in practical applications to ﬁnance, mainly because both the theoretical and
practical complexity of a model increases if one moves from a normal to a non-normal
framework. However, the multivariate normal distribution has two main drawbacks: (1)
its margins are normally distributed, therefore it does not capture empirically observed
skewness and kurtosis; (2) its dependence structure is symmetric, it does not capture
asymmetry of dependence during extreme market movements and the dependence of tail
events. For the reasons above, in this work we implement multivariate non-normal models
with volatility clustering for the CoVaR estimation.

More in details, we assume that the univariate time series have AR-GARCH dynamics
with Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle (GJR) volatility (see Glosten et al. (1993)) and then
we analyze diﬀerent dependence structures. Among possible multivariate parametric
models applied to ﬁnance (see Bianchi et al. (2020)), we select the multivariate normal
tempered stable (MNTS) and the multivariate generalized hyperbolic (MGH) model,
and four copula functions, normal, t and BB1 and BB7, as described in Jaworski (2017),
De Luca and Rivieccio (2018) and De Luca et al. (2019). Both non-normal multivariate
distributions and copula functions are widely known in the ﬁnancial literature. Bianchi
et al. (2016) and Bianchi and Tassinari (2020) analyzed both MNTS e MGH models
applied to risk assessment and portfolio optimizations (see also Fallahgoul and Loeper
(2019) and Bianchi et al. (2019)). Kurosaki and Kim (2013b) developed a model based
on the MNTS distribution to estimate the CoVaR, and subsequently Kurosaki and Kim
(2013a) and Biglova et al. (2014) studied a mean-CoAVaR strategy applied to portfolio
optimization to mitigate the potential loss arising from systemic risk.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2 we describe the
methodology implemented in this work: we deﬁne both the univariate model and the
dependence structure, we show the necessary formulas to compute the CoVaR≤. After
having described in Section 3 the market data considered in this study, the main empirical
results are discussed in Section 4. In Section 5 we compare the diﬀerent distributional
assumptions through a backtesting exercise. In Section 6 we compare the ∆CoVaR with
the score deﬁned by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) for the global systemically
important banks (GSIBs) bucket allocation and we introduce a score adjusted for the
information coming from the stock markets.. Section 7 concludes.

2 Methodology

For each institution j, the random variable yj
t represents the log-returns of the market
value of equity. Superscript sys denotes the entire ﬁnancial system, i.e. the capitalization-
weighted portfolio of all ﬁnancial institutions in the selected sample or an index repre-
sentative of the stock market and frequently used by ﬁnancial professionals (i.e. the S&P
500 index or the Euro Stoxx 50 index).

At time t, given the VaR of the ﬁnancial institution j, with tail level α (VaRj

α,t),
for a given tail level β, the CoVaR≤j
β,α,t of the ﬁnancial system conditional on ﬁnancial
institution j being in distress (i.e. market returns of bank j are less or equal to its VaRα)
is equal to

(cid:16)

P

t ≤ CoVaR≤j
ysys

β,α,t | yj

t ≤ VaRj

α,t

(cid:17)

= β.

(2.1)

A tail level α equal to 1% (2.5% or 5%) denotes a distress state of the world, while a
level α equal to 50% denotes a normal, or median, state. The ﬁnancial institution j
contribution to systemic risk is deﬁned by

∆CoVaR≤j

β,α,t = CoVaR≤j

β,α,t − CoVaR≤j

β,0.5,t.

(2.2)

∆CoVaR≤j
β,α,t captures the negative externality that ﬁnancial institution j imposes on
the ﬁnancial system. As described in the following sections, we estimate the CoVaR and
the ∆CoVaR of main listed European banks over the time span from January 2007 to
March 2020 by using diﬀerent dependence structure.

The systemic risk measure estimation is divided in three steps. In the ﬁrst step we
estimate a univariate AR-GARCH model to the time series of log-returns and compute
the VaR at the given tail level α. In the second step we calibrate the dependence structure
by applying diﬀerent multivariate approaches. In the third step we estimate the systemic
risk measure by means of a numerical integration and (or) a numerical inversion.

Let St be the stock price process of a given ﬁnancial institution and

yt = log

St
St−1

be its log-return process. We assume for the log-return process an AR-GARCH model
with GJR dynamics for the volatility, that is

yt = ayt−1 + σtεt + c
t = α0 + α1 (|σt−1εt−1| − γ (σt−1εt−1))2 + β1σ2
σ2

t−1

(2.3)

where the innovation εt are independent and identically distributed random variables
with zero mean and unit variance. As observed in Kim et al. (2011), the follow equality
holds

VaRα(yt+1) = ayt + σt(VaRα(εt+1)) + c.

(2.4)

that in practice means that it is possible to compute the VaR on the basis of the quantile
of a standardized random variable.
It should be noted that a numerical inversion is
usually needed to compute these quantiles.

After having estimated for each bank and for the system the univariate discrete-time
dynamic volatility model deﬁned in equation (2.3), we extract the innovations and esti-
mate diﬀerent dependence structures. We consider the multivariate normal tempered sta-
ble (MNTS) model, the multivariate generalized hyperbolic (MGH) model, as described
in Bianchi et al. (2019), and the best copula function in terms of AIC among normal,
t, BB1 and BB7 copulas, as described in De Luca and Rivieccio (2018) and De Luca
et al. (2019). For the MNTS and MGH models we estimate a 13-dimensional model by
using an ad-hoc procedure implemented in R considering an expectation-maximization
maximum-likelihood approach. Diﬀerently, the copulas are calibrated on bivariate time
for each couple j, the couple εsys and εj is considered) and they are esti-
series (i.e.
mated through the VineCopula package of R. While the estimation of both the MNTS
adn MGH is time-consuming from a computational point of view and for this reason we
decide to run few estimation procedures as possible, thus instead of estimating a bivari-
ate model we perform a 13-dimensional estimation, the estimation of copula functions in
large dimension can be problematic from a numerical error perspective, thus instead of
estimating a 13-dimensional model we perform a bivariate estimation.

After these two estimation steps, we forecast the one-day ahead volatility obtained
from the estimated AR-GARCH parameters. While in the MNTS (MGH) model εsys
and εj are assumed NTS (GH) distributed, in the copula model they are assumed skew-t
distributed. This means that to evaluate the univariate VaR for the each single bank
j, while in the NTS (GH) case one needs to invert the cumulative distribution function
obtained by means of the fast Fourier transform algorithm (Bianchi et al. (2019)), in the
skew-t case the VaR can be directly obtained through the qsstd function of the fGarch
package of R.

On the basis of the univariate and multivariate estimates, it is possible to evaluate the
CoVaR for each ﬁnancial institution j and time t. While closed formula for the CoVaR
are available under normal distributional assumptions (see Bernard et al. (2012)), for
non-normal models a numerical integration procedure is needed (see Girardi and Erg¨un
(2013) and Bernard and Czado (2015)). More in details, equation (2.1) can be written
as

t ≤ VaRj
(cid:1)

and by the deﬁnition of VaR, it follows that

to obtain an estimate of CoVaR≤. The integral in equation (2.6) is evaluated by the
numerical integration algorithm implemented in the quadrature function of the mvQuad
package of R. Thus, the CoVaR estimate is obtained through the one dimensional root

ﬁnding algorithm implemented in the uniroot function of the stats package of R. As
observed by Banulescu et al. (2020), it is interesting to highlight that by slightly modifying
the integral in equation (2.6) it is possible to obtain an estimate of the marginal expected
shortfall.

It should be noted that, as in equation (2.4), the CoVaR can be computed by con-
sidering the density of the bivariate random variable deﬁned by εsys
t and then
by performing a location and scale transformation based on the estimated AR-GARCH
parameters.

where C is a given copula function. By following the approach described in Bernard et al.
(2012), it is possible to obtain an estimate of the CoVaR by means of the inversion of
the copula function. After having estimated the bivariate copula function the CoVaR
estimate is obtained through the one dimensional root ﬁnding algorithm implemented in
the uniroot function of the stats package of R.

As we will show in Section 4 the CoVaR≤ based on these multivariate models is
compared to the CoVaR= based on the multivariate normal GARCH model as deﬁned
by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) and empirically studied by Bianchi and Sorrentino
(2020).

3 Data

Before starting with the empirical analysis, in this section we provide a description of the
data used in this study. We obtained from Thomson Reuters Datastream daily dividend-
adjusted closing prices from January 2002 to March 2020 for a sample of listed banks
of the euro area belonging to the main or to the additional GSIB assessment sample
for a total of twelve banks. These banks are: Deutsche Bank (D:DBK), Commerzbank
(D:CBK), Unicredit (I:UCG), Intesa (I:ISP), BNP Paribas (F:BNP), Soci´et´e G´en´erale
(F:SGE), Cr´edit Agricole (F:CRDA), BBVA (E:BBVA), Santander (E:SAN), Banco de
Sabadell (E:BSAB), KBC Group (B:KC) and ING Bank (H:INGA). We refer to these
European banks as GSIBs, even if for some of these banks there is no additional capital
requirements.
In this study the system is the Euro Stoxx 50 index. The time period
in this analysis includes the high volatility period after the Lehman Brothers ﬁling for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection (September 15, 2008), the eurozone sovereign debt
crisis, during which, in November 2011, the spread between the 10-year Italian BTP and
the German Bund with the same maturity exceeded 500 basis points, the turmoil after
the Italian political elections in 2018 and the recent ﬁnancial market crash at the end of
the ﬁrst quarter of 2020.

The CoVaR (∆CoVaR) is estimated on the basis of the time series from the previous
ﬁve years. For example, the CoVaR (∆CoVaR) for July 16, 2007 is estimated from the
data for the period from July 16, 2002 to July 16, 2007. For each bank and each model
we consider 3,389 estimations from January 2, 2007 to March 30, 2020.

4 Empirical results

In this section we compare the diﬀerent non-normal models with the multivariate normal
one to which we refer to as MNormal. Additionally, we estimate both the CoVaR≤
and CoVaR= under this multivariate assumption. Recall that the CoVaR= under the
MNormal assumption is the systemic risk measure originally proposed by Adrian and
Brunnermeier (2016).

As observed in Section 2, the ﬁrst step is the estimation of the univariate autoregres-
sive GARCH model with GJR dynamics for both system and banks log-returns. This
step is performed through the garchFit function of the package fGarch of R. While for the
multivariate models we consider a normal distributional assumption to extract the inno-
vations, for the copula model we directly consider the skew-t distributional assumption.
The former approach can be viewed as a quasi maximum-likelihood-estimation (QMLE)
approach (see Goode et al. (2015)). Additionally, at each estimation step we verify if the
autoregressive component is statistically signiﬁcant: if it is not, we estimate the model
without the autoregressive component.

After estimating the univariate dynamic volatility models, we extract the innovations
and estimate the multivariate models (MNTS and MGH) and the copula ones. There
are remarkable diﬀerences in terms of computational time between the two approaches.
While for a one-step estimation of the four competitor bivariate copulas 0.9 seconds are
needed, for a one-step estimation of the multivariate MNTS (MGH) model around 150
(10) seconds are needed. For each estimation day, in the copula case we have 12 inde-
pendent bivariate estimations and in the multivariate case we have a single multivariate
estimation. This means that the computing time of the copula and MGH model is similar
to the copula one, but the computing time of the MNTS model is 15 times larger. By
considering that the overall computing time is around 24 hours for the faster models, to
deal with the MNTS estimation problem we relied on an eﬃcient R code making use of
the packages foreach and doParallel and run it on a multi-core platform.

As far as the copula model is concerned, on the basis of the AIC criterion the t-copula
is selected in most of the cases (around 88% over the 40,668 bivariate estimation), in
very few cases the normal copula (0.5%) and in all other cases the BB1 (around 12%).
As observed above, it should be noted that only 0.9 seconds are needed to perform a
one-step estimation of four bivariate copulas.

For each model and each margin (i.e. each bank) Figure 1 shows the average value
over the entire estimation window from January 2, 2007 to March 30, 2020 of the p-value
of the KS test. Even if the normal model has a satisfactory performance, in all cases the
non-normal models are better than the normal one. The overall performance of the three
non-normal models is comparable.

While for the copula model the computing time for VaR and CoVaR is instantaneous
and the overall computing time is a few minutes, this is not the case for multivariate

6

models. The time needed to estimate the CoVaR for the MNTS, the MGH and the
MNormal model for a given day is around 8 minutes. For this reason also in this case we
relied on a multi-core implementation. However, the VaR estimations are 60 times faster
than the CoVaR ones. The main bottleneck is the numerical evaluation of the double
integral in the MNTS case. It should be noted that the evaluation of the density function
of a bivariate MNTS random variable is based on both a numerical integration and the
FFT algorithm and, in the evaluation of the double integral, a large number of points is
needed for the bidimensional grid in order to avoid numerical errors .

In order to show the diﬀerences between models, we show in Figure 2 the average time
series computed across all banks from January 2, 2007 to March 30, 2020 of the CoVaR=
based on the multivariate normal model and the CoVaR≤ based on the MNormal, the
MGH, the MNTS and the copula model for various level of α and β. In the MNormal
and the three non-normal CoVaR≤ cases we report the diﬀerences with respect to the
CoVaR=.

In Figure 3 we report the time series of the average ∆CoVaR= based on the multivari-
ate normal model. We consider α and β equal to 0.05 in equation (2.2). The average is
computed across all banks. Then, we compare the ∆CoV aR= to the ∆CoVaR≤ evaluated
under diﬀerent distributional assumptions. In the MNormal case in panel (b) it appears
a large diﬀerence between CoVaR≤ and CoVaR=. This diﬀerence increases and changes
in sign in non-normal cases. In all cases this diﬀerence varies over time. As shown in
the violin plot on the right side of panel (b), it ranges from an average value of -0.55%
in MNormal case to 0.035% in MGH case. The maximum distance is reached in March
2020 and it ranges from -2.8% in the MNormal case to 5.3% in the skew-t case. Recall
that the violin plot is a method of drawing numeric data and combining a box plot with
a kernel density plot.

5 Backtesting

The deﬁnition (2.1) allows one to perform a two-steps backtesting. In both steps it is
possible to follow the approach proposed in Christoﬀersen (2010). First we conduct a
preliminary VaR back-test by considering the entire observation window and deﬁning a
ﬁrst hit sequence (1 if the loss of the ﬁnancial institution on that day was larger than its
predicted VaR level, and zero otherwise). Then we deﬁne a subset of observations on the
basis on the distress of the ﬁnancial institution j (i.e. yi
α,t). Thus, by looking at
this subset, we can backtest the CoVaR. More in details, we compare the CoVaR forecast
with the ex-post loss of the ﬁnancial system and deﬁne a second hit sequence which is 1
if the loss of the ﬁnancial system on that day is larger than its predicted CoVaR level,
and zero otherwise.

t ≤ VaRj

For evaluating the accuracy of forecasted VaR and CoVaR for the models analyzed in
this paper, we perform the likelihood ratio (LR) tests proposed by Christoﬀersen (1998)
and Christoﬀersen (2010). The LR tests use the number of violations (i.e. the hit se-
quences deﬁned above), where violations occur when the actual loss exceeds the estimated
VaR (CoVaR). The LR test consists of three parts: (1) the LR test of unconditional cov-
erage (LRuc), which is the same as the proportion of failures test by Kupiec (1995), (2)
the LR test of independence (LRind), and (3) the joint test of coverage and independence

7

(LRcc). In Figure 4 we report the p-values of the LR test of unconditional coverage (uc)
and coverage and independence (cc) for both VaR and CoVaR for all analyzed models
and various values of α and β. We do not report the p-values for the LR test of indepen-
dence. The backtest for α = 0.5 and β = 0.05 is not reported, even if it shows satisfactory
results. By equation (2.2), the tail level α = 0.5 is important to compute the ∆CoVaR.
In order to backtest the CoVaR, a large number of observation is needed. Here we are
considering 3,389 observations, this means that there are enough observations to backtest
almost all tail levels α, but it is not possible to backtest all meaningful tail levels β. For
example, even if we are considering more than 18 years of daily data, it is not possible to
study the CoVaR for α and β equal to 0.01, because in this case the theoretical number
of exceedances is less than one.

We further consider the dynamic quantile (dq) test proposed by Engle and Manganelli
(2004), that can be viewed as a more general formulation of the tests proposed above and
two loss functions, that is the magnitude loss (LM) and the asymmetric magnitude loss
(LA) function as deﬁned by Amendola and Candila (2016). The farther the actual number
of violations is from the expected one, the larger is the value of these loss functions.
The LA function is built to penalize more heavily the models with a higher number of
violations with respect to the number of expected violations. The two functions are

and

LM =

(cid:26) 1 + (yt − VaRt)2

0

if yt < VaRt
if yt ≥ VaRt

LA =

(cid:26) P (1 + |yt − VaRt|)

|yt − VaRt|

if yt < VaRt
if yt ≥ VaRt

with P = exp((ˆα − α)/α) if ˆα > α and P = 1 in the opposite case, where ˆα is the
empirical coverage. In Tables from 1 to 3 we report for each bank and for all α and β
considered in this study the p-values of the three tests (uc, cc and dq) and the values of
the two loss functions (LM and LA).

As far as the VaR backtesting is concerned, the non-normal models (MNTS, MGH
and copula) largely outperform the MNormal model, at least for the tail probability levels
that are usually of interest (i.e.
for α equal to 0.01 and 0.025). However, for α equal
to 0.05, the MNormal model shows a better performance than the copula model, even if
in the copula model case the null hypothesis is never rejected. This in practice means
that capturing the volatility clustering eﬀect is of paramount importance in evaluating
risk measures, at least for the dataset analyzed in this study. Diﬀerently, in the CoVaR
backtesting the MNormal model is always rejected and the non-normal model show always
a satisfactory performance. By looking at the p-values of the three tests the MNTS and
the MGH model seems slightly better in comparison with their competitor models.

As far as the VaR estimates are concerned, the results in Tables from 1 to 3 show
that the LM function is smaller for the MGH and the MNTS models with respect to the
copula model in 12 cases out of 12 when α = 0.05, in 9 cases out of 12 when α = 0.025,
and in 8 cases out of 12 when α = 0.01. Similar ﬁndings hold for the LA function, with
the exception of the α = 0.01 case. However, it should be noted that, on average, also
the MNormal model show satisfactory results in terms of loss functions.

As far as the CoVaR estimates are concerned, the results in Tables from 1 to 3 show
that the LM function is smaller for the MGH and the MNTS models with respect to the

8

copula model in 23 cases out of 36 when α = 0.05, in 16 cases out of 24 when α = 0.025,
and in 4 cases out of 12 when α = 0.01. Similar ﬁndings hold for the LA function.
However, it should be noted that while, on average, there are not remarkable diﬀerences
between the three non-normal models in terms of loss functions, the performance of the
MNormal model is not satisfactory.

At least for the time-series and the values of α and β analyzed in this study, the non-
normal multivariate models (i.e. the MGH and the MNTS model) slightly outperform the
copula from both a VaR and a CoVaR perspective. The MNormal approach is satisfactory
only in the VaR case, but its performance is not good enough in the CoVaR backtesting.

6 GSIBs indicators

In this section, we compare the ranking provided by the ∆CoVaR with the ranking iden-
tiﬁed by the FSB for the GSIBs as deﬁned in the Financial Stability Board (2011) policy
document and on its yearly updates. The FSB approach relies on ﬁrm-speciﬁc infor-
mation on size, interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity, and cross-jurisdictional
activity and it considers annual accounting and other data provided to regulators by ﬁ-
nancial institutions (see also Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2011) and Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (2013)).

More precisely, the GSIB framework analyze bank activities over 12 indicators. Each
bank indicator is compared with the aggregate indicators of all banks in the speciﬁed
sample (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2014)). These indicators are grouped
into ﬁve categories (i.e. size, interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity and cross-
jurisdictional activity). To calculate the score needed to determine the additional require-
ment, for each given indicator, the bank reported value for that indicator is divided by
the corresponding sample total, and the resulting value is then expressed in basis points
(bps). The ﬁnal score is obtained as weighted average of the 12 indicators or as simple
average of the ﬁve category scores (the average is rounded to the nearest whole basis
point). Both speciﬁc bank and aggregated indicators are available on the FSB website.2
The score represents a bank activities as a percentage of the sample total and is used to
determine the bank additional requirement. A higher score results in a higher require-
ment. On the basis on the indicators obtained from the FSB website we compute the
score for a subsample of listed European banks for which these indicators are available
(for Banco de Sabadell and KBC Group the indicators are not available). These scores
are not equal to the oﬃcial ones, because here we are considering only a subsample of
banks.

By following the same approach implemented for the evaluation of the GSIBs indi-
cators, for each model, we compute the annual average of the ∆CoVaR and rescale it in
order to obtain the corresponding score expressed in basis points. We consider α and β
equal to 0.05. Both indicators and scores are reported in Table 4, where the sum of each
column is by construction equal to 10,000 basis points (i.e. 100%). The banks are ordered
from the most to the less systemic according the GSIBs score. By looking at the values
and at the colours of these scores, it appears evident that the variability across banks
of the score deﬁned on the basis of the ∆CoVaR is not high. Additionally, as shown in

Figure 2, there are large diﬀerences in terms of CoVaR between diﬀerent models. The
diﬀerences between models decrease when one evaluates the ∆CoVaR (see Figure 3), and
they decrease further when the annual average is computed. While, if one looks at daily
estimates, the non-normal CoVaR is able to capture tail events, this seems not to be
necessarily the case if one looks at annual averages. However, even if one looks at the
annual maximum values, the overall results of the analysis are closed to those shown in
Table 4 where the annual averages are considered.

In Table 4 we report the average indicators and scores over the years from 2013
to 2018. There is a large diﬀerence between the GSIBs score and the score based on
the ∆CoVaR, particularly for some banks (see also Jokivuolle et al. (2018)). However,
there are not remarkable diﬀerences in the ∆CoVaR scores computed under diﬀerent
distributional assumptions.

Thus, we deﬁne the average relative percentage error (ARPE) with respect to the

GSIBs score as

ARP E =

1
nobs

|scoreGSIBs

j,t

− score∆CoVaR

j,t

|

(cid:88)

j,t

scoreGSIBs

j,t

(6.1)

where nobs is the number of observations and scoreGSIBs
represent
the GSIBs score and the score computed on the basis of the ∆CoVaR estimates. The
ARPE from 2013 to 2018 across the ten banks in the sample is around 50%. As observed
above, the GSIBs score is computed as

and score∆CoVaR

=

i

ωiCategoryi

where i goes from 1 to 5 (size, interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity and cross-
jurisdictional activity) and the weights ωi are all equal to 0.2.

Since the ARPE value is high, we try to modify the weights ωi of the ﬁve categories
in order to minimize the percentage diﬀerence in equation (6.1), and we refer to them as
minimum distance weights. By considering these weights, the ARPE with respect to the
GSIBs score decreases to around 30%.

However, for all models only size and interconnectedness have minimum distance
weights diﬀerent from zero. The size weight range from 18% for the MNTS model to 30%
for the normal model, and the interconnectedness ranges from 70% for the normal model
to 82% for the MNTS model. It seems that the ∆CoVaR is correlated only with the size
and interconnectedness. Conversely, it is not correlated with the other three categories.
Once we have these new weights, we can compute the corresponding score which is a
sort of adjusted GSIBs score, as reported in Table 4. This adjusted score can be view as
a GSIBs score adjusted for the information coming from the stock market.

7 Conclusions

In this paper we compute the CoVaR and the ∆CoVaR under diﬀerent distributional
assumptions and diﬀerent CoVaR deﬁnitions (i.e. CoVaR= and CoVaR≤). In order to
backtest the CoVaR≤, we conduct an empirical test over more than 18 years of daily stock

10

log-returns. We calibrate three diﬀerent models allowing for volatility clustering, heavy
tails and non-linear dependence. These multivariate non-normal models outperform the
normal one in term of log-returns ﬁtting, VaR and CoVaR backtesting for all tail levels
analyzed in this study. The backtesting exercise shows that the performance of the MGH
(MNTS) model is slightly better compared to the copula model, however this latter
approach is very promising from a computational point of view. Finally, we compare the
score obtained through the ∆CoVaR measure with the GSIBs score deﬁned by the FSB
and introduce a score adjusted for the information coming from the stock markets.

Figure 1: For each margin and each model we report the average p-value of the KS test from January
2, 2007 to March 30, 2020.

Figure 2: We report the average time series computed across all banks from January 2, 2007 to March
30, 2020 of the CoVaR= based on the multivariate normal model (normal) and the CoVaR≤ based on the
MNormal, the MGH, the MNTS and the copula model for various level of α and β, that is (a) α = 0.5
and β = 0.025, (b) α = β = 0.05, (c) α = 0.05 and β = 0.025, (d) α = 0.05 and β = 0.01, (e) α = 0.025
and β = 0.05, (f) α = β = 0.025, and (g) α = 0.01 and β = 0.05. We show the diﬀerences with respect
to the (a) case. All values are changed in sign.

19

Figure 3: In the panel (a) we report the time series from January 2, 2007 to March 30, 2020 of the
∆CoVaR= based on the multivariate normal GARCH model with GJR dynamics. In the panel (b) for
each model we report for the same time window the time series and the violin plot of the diﬀerence
between the ∆CoVaR≤ and the above ∆CoVaR=. In all cases we consider α and β equal to 0.05. All
values are changed in sign.

coverage and independence (cc) for both VaR and CoVaR for all analyzed models.
