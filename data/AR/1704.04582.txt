Neutrino-nucleus cross-sections at supernova neutrino energies

S. Chauhan, M. Sajjad Athar∗ and S. K. Singh
Department of Physics, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh - 202 002, India

The inclusive neutrino/antineutrino-induced charged and neutral current reaction cross-sections
in 12C, 16O, 40Ar, 56F e and 208P b in the energy region of supernova neutrinos/antineutrinos are
studied. The calculations are performed in the local density approximation (LDA) taking into
account the eﬀects due to Pauli blocking, Fermi motion and the renormalization of weak transition
strengths in the nuclear medium. The eﬀect of Coulomb distortion of the lepton produced in the
charged current reactions has also been included. The numerical results for the energy dependence
of the cross-section σ(E) as well as the ﬂux averaged cross-section and event rates for the charged
lepton production in the case of some supernova neutrino/antineutrino ﬂuxes recently discussed
in the literature have been presented. We have also given the ﬂux-averaged angular and energy
distributions of the charged leptons corresponding to these ﬂuxes.

INTRODUCTION

2.5

Supernova explosion is a phenomenon which occurs in the late phase of stellar evolution. In this explosion, most
of the gravitational energy released in a core collapse is carried by the neutrinos. Such neutrino bursts carry about
1053 ergs of energy in a very short period of time [1]. It is considered that these neutrinos provide valuable
≈
information about the proto-neutron star core, its equation of state, core collapse and supernova explosion mechanism
and help to have a better understanding of the supernova physics [1, 2]. After the observation of supernova neutrinos
from SN1987A in Kamiokande, IMB and BAKSAN [3, 4], the feasibility of detecting such events in the future is
now given serious consideration. For example, the experiments like SuperKamiokande (SK) [5], Large Volume De-
tector (LVD) [6], Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) [7], Boron solar neutrino experiment
(BOREXino) [8], Observatory for Multiﬂavour Neutrino Interactions from Supernovae (OMNIS) [9], Lead Astro-
nomical Neutrino Detector (LAND) [10], Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) [11], Imaging Cosmic And Rare
Underground Signals (ICARUS) [12], etc., are in various stages of operation while Sudbury Neutrino Observatory
(SNO+) [13], Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) [14] experiments are being developed, and experiments like Deep Un-
derground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) [15] and Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) [16, 17]
are planned to study the physics related to supernova neutrinos in the near future. A list of the present and future
experiments having sensitivity to the supernova neutrinos/antineutrinos is given in Table I [18]. These experiments
are planned to use detector with various nuclei as the target material. This makes the knowledge of neutrino nu-
cleus cross-section of low energy neutrino/antineutrino scattering from the medium and heavy nuclear targets as an
important aspect of the study of supernova neutrino detection. Another aspect of considerable importance in the
study of supernova physics is the knowledge of neutrino/antineutrino ﬂuxes which are determined by the numerical
simulations of supernova explosion of stars.

The supernova neutrino/antineutrino ﬂuxes are determined from the numerical simulations of core-collapse super-
nova explosion of a star and depend on the initial properties of the collapsing star like its mass, density and equation of
state as well as on various physical processes controlling the explosion like initial prompt burst of neutrinos following
neutronization, accretion and cooling in late phases as well as the neutrino transport in the dense star matter [19–22].
The neutrino/antineutrino ﬂuxes are found to be sensitive to the luminosities Lν of various neutrino/antineutrino
ﬂavors which are believed to be equal for all the six ﬂavors of neutrinos/antineutrinos νe, ¯νe and νx (x = µ, τ ) due
to the assumption of equipartition of total available energy amongst various ﬂavors. Some recent calculations have
also been done assuming luminosities for νx which are diﬀerent from the luminosities of νe(¯νe) and varying them in
the range of 0.5Lν < Lx < 2Lν and keeping the luminosities of νe and ¯νe to be the same [23–28]. The simulated
neutrino/antineutrino ﬂuxes and mean energies of their various ﬂavors are in general distinct from each other due
to diﬀerences in their interaction with the dense star matter which has an excess of neutrons over protons. This
diﬀerence leads to νe loosing more energy as compared to ¯νe, which looses more energy than νx (x = µ, τ and
their antineutrinos) as νx interact only through the neutral current interaction (due to higher threshold energy for
charged current reactions induced by νx), while νe and ¯νe interact by the neutral as well as the charged current

in recent studies [29] when additional medium eﬀects are taken into account. These additional medium eﬀects are
generated by neutrino-neutrino self interactions [30–34] and neutrino-matter interactions when primary neutrinos of
all ﬂavors propagate through a medium of very high neutrino densities and matter densities causing ﬂavor conver-
sions [35–38]. The nonlinear equations of motion for neutrino propagation in the presence of neutrino-neutrino and
neutrino-matter interaction potential give rise to collective neutrino ﬂavor oscillations [31–34] which along with ﬂavor
oscillations due to MSW matter eﬀects [39, 40] contribute to the ﬂavor conversion of neutrino aﬀecting the neutrino
ﬂux spectra. The quantitative modiﬁcations in the spectra due to these eﬀects depend upon the speciﬁc value of
the theoretical input parameters used in the simulations, i.e., matter density proﬁles, neutrino oscillation parameters
specially the third neutrino mixing angle θ13, neutrino mass hierarchy, i.e., being normal or inverted as well as the
approximations used in solving the nonlinear equations of motion. Thus, the simulated neutrino ﬂavor spectra at the
surface of the star are subjected to various uncertainties of theoretical parameters used in the simulation studies of
the explosion and propagation of neutrino in the dense star matter leading to large variations in the predicted spectra
for various ﬂavors of neutrino/antineutrino [23, 24].

10

In the present work, we have taken the numerical ﬂux for νe and ¯νe given by Totani et al.[19], Duan et al.[31]
and Gava et al.[32] as shown in Fig.(1). While all of these spectra peak in the region of 8 - 12 MeV, their strength
and shape are predicted to be diﬀerent for the neutrinos/antineutrinos ((¯νe)νe) . They all have long high energy tail
regions which are diﬀerent from each other and may lead to quite diﬀerent results for the ﬂux-averaged cross-sections,
angular and lepton energy distributions of the produced electron (positron) after interaction with the nuclear target
in the detector. The main aim of the present work is to study

the nuclear medium eﬀects in the neutrino/antineutrino-nucleus cross-sections in the medium and heavy nuclei

the diﬀerences in electron (positron) yields, their angular and energy distributions in the present and future
experiments arising due to the use of diﬀerent neutrino/antineutrino ﬂuxes when a given nuclear target is used
in a detector.

Most of the proposed experiments planned to study supernova neutrinos shall be using 12C, 16O, 40Ar, 56F e and
208P b as target nuclei in the detectors as shown in Table-I [5, 6, 8–17, 41–43]. In these nuclei, it becomes important
to study the role of nuclear medium eﬀects on the neutrino/antineutrino-nucleus cross-sections. In the energy region
of supernova neutrino/antineutrino energies shown in Fig.(1), many transitions leading to higher nuclear states in
the ﬁnal nucleus in addition to the ground state (g.s.) to ground state (g.s.)
transition contribute to the cross-
section. The cross-sections corresponding to exclusive as well as inclusive reactions are generally computed using shell
model [44–50]. However, various other microscopic approaches like the random phase approximation (RPA) [51–56],
continuum random phase approximation (CRPA) [57–61], combined shell model and random phase approximation
CRPA[51, 62–64], quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA) [65–69], projected QRPA [70], relativistic

(solid line) and Gava et al. [32](dashed line).

quasiparticle RPA [71] and relativistic nuclear energy density functional (RNEDF) [72] methods have been used to
calculate these cross-sections. However, in the case of inclusive reactions, Fermi gas models have also been used to
calculate these cross-sections [73–77]. This model is later extended to the local Fermi gas (LFG) model which takes
into account the long range correlation eﬀects through RPA [52–54, 78–83].

In this work, we present a calculation of the inclusive reactions for supernova neutrino/antineutrino in 12C, 16O,
40Ar, 56F e and 208P b induced by the charged current and the neutral current processes. The eﬀect of Coulomb
distortion of the outgoing lepton produced in the charged current induced reactions is also taken into account using
the modiﬁed eﬀective momentum approximation (MEMA) [84]. This work improves upon our earlier work [78–80], by
taking into account the modiﬁcation due to nuclear medium eﬀect consistently up to the order q
M in the evaluation
of neutrino-nucleus cross-section.

In section-II, we present in brief the formalism used to describe various nuclear medium eﬀects included in the

calculations. In section-III, results are presented and discussed. We conclude our ﬁndings in section-IV.

2. Neutral current induced reactions in the presence of nonstandard interaction (NSI)

Non Standard Interactions in the neutral current sector are predicted in various models proposed to describe
the physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) implied by the observation of neutrino oscillations. However, a
model-independent phenomenological parameterization of NSI [85, 86] is generally used to calculate the additional
contributions due to these interactions. A deviation from the expected cross-section in the SM is the signature of
the presence of NSI. The eﬀect of these NSI in supernova physics specially in the detection of supernova signal in
terrestrial detectors has been studied by some authors [87–89]. In this description, the matrix element for the NC
interaction of a neutrino with hadron using an eﬀective phenomenological Lagrangian is given by

energy νµ and νe scattering seem to be consistent with ǫV
eµ to
calculate the NSI contribution to the neutrino-nucleon scattering specially for 208P b as done by Papoulias and Kosmas
[89]. It will be interesting to study the NC excitation of 208P b to excited states and observe neutron emissions in the
proposed HALO detector [11]. However, in this work, we report on the contribution of NSI to the total cross-section
in NC induced νe scattering on 208P b. For the numerical calculations, we have used the parameterization of Papoulias
and Kosmas [89] for the weak nucleon form factor in the presence of NSI which are described in Appendix A-3.

C. Cross-Section on nuclear targets

When the processes given by Eq. (2) or (12) take place in a nucleus, various nuclear medium eﬀects like Pauli
blocking, Fermi motion, binding energy corrections and nucleon correlations, etc. come into play. Moreover, in the
case of CC reactions, the charged lepton produced in the ﬁnal state moves in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the residual nucleus
and aﬀects its energy and momentum. We have taken into account these eﬀects which are brieﬂy discussed below:

1. In the standard treatment of Fermi Gas Model applied to neutrino reactions, the quantum states of the nucleons
3 , where ρ is the density of the
inside the nucleus are ﬁlled up to a Fermi momentum pF , given by pF =
nucleus. In a nuclear reaction, the momentum of the initial nucleon p is therefore constrained to be p < pF and
p′(=
F is
the Fermi momentum of the outgoing nucleon. The total energies of the initial (i) and ﬁnal (f ) nucleons are
Ei =
f . In this model, the Fermi momentum and energy are constrained

to be determined by the nuclear density which is constant.

In the LFG model, the Fermi momenta of the initial and ﬁnal nucleons are not constant, but depend upon
the interaction point r and are given by pFn (r) and pFp (r) for neutron and proton, respectively, where
pFn(r) =
3 , ρn(r) and ρp(r) being the neutron and proton nuclear densities,
respectively, and the expressions are given in Appendix-B.

For neutrino/antineutrino-nucleon scattering from a nuclear target, we deﬁne an occupation number nN (p, r)
such that at position r, where the interaction takes place, the initial nucleon has ni(p, r)=1 for p < pF (r), where
pF (r) is the Fermi momentum at position r. In Appendix-B, we have also shown the Fermi momentum (pF (r))
as a function of position (r) for the various nuclei used in this work.

In the local density approximation (LDA), the cross-section(σ) for the ν(¯ν) scattering from a nucleon moving
in the nucleus with a momentum p is given by

σ(q2, k′) =

i(f ) = n(p) f or ν and p(n) f or ¯ν.

(15)

Instead of using Eq. 15, we use the methods of many-body ﬁeld theory [92] where the reaction cross-section
e− + p in a nuclear medium is given in terms of the imaginary part of the Lindhard
for the process νe + n
function UN (q0, q) corresponding to the p
h excitation diagram shown in Fig.(2) [52]. This imaginary part
UN (q0, q) is obtained by cutting the W (Z) self-energy diagram along the horizontal line(Fig.(2)) and applying
the Cutkowsky rules [93]. This is equivalent to replacing the expression

2. In the charged current reaction, the energy and momentum of the outgoing charged lepton are modiﬁed due
to the Coulomb interaction of the charged lepton with the ﬁnal nucleus. The Coulomb distortion eﬀect on the
outgoing lepton has been taken into account in MEMA [84] in which the lepton momentum and energy are
modiﬁed by replacing El by El + Vc(r). The form of Coulomb potential Vc(r) considered here is [94]:

where α is ﬁne structure constant(1/137.035), Zf is the charge of the outgoing lepton which is -1 in the case of
neutrino and +1 in the case of antineutrino, and ρp(r)(ρn(r)) is the proton(neutron) density of the ﬁnal nucleus.
Incorporation of these considerations results in the modiﬁcation in the argument of Lindhard function, i.e.,

With the inclusion of these nuclear eﬀects, the cross-section σ(Eν ) is written as

3. In the nucleus, the strength of the electroweak couplings may change from their free nucleon values due to
the presence of strongly interacting nucleons. Conservation of vector current (CVC) forbids any change in the
charge coupling while the magnetic and axial vector couplings are likely to change from their free nucleon values.
There exists considerable work in understanding the quenching of magnetic moment and axial charge in nuclei
due to the nucleon-nucleon correlations.
In our approach, these are reﬂected in the modiﬁcation of nuclear
response in the longitudinal and transverse channels leading to some reduction. We calculate this reduction in
the vector-axial(VA) and axial-axial(AA) response functions due to the long range nucleon-nucleon correlations
treated in the RPA, diagrammatically shown in Fig.(3). The weak nucleon current described by Eq.(5) gives
σ×q
in the nonrelativistic limit, terms like FAστ+ and iF V

as well as the longitudinal channels. These channels produce diﬀerent RPA responses in the longitudinal and

A total scattering cross-section
σ(E) as well as the angular and energy distribution of the electrons (positrons) for the supernova neutrino spectra
given in Fig.(1). These results have been presented using the expression of the cross-section given in Eq.(21) with
RPA eﬀect. The averaged cross-section is deﬁned in Eq.(22) for the low energy accelerator neutrinos and in Eq.(23)
for the supernova neutrinos. The nuclear densities given in Eqs.(38) & (39), with the parameters shown in Table-IV
are used in these calculations.

In subsection III A, we ﬁrst show our results for the energy dependence of the total cross-section in the low energy
region of neutrinos for 12C, 16O, 40Ar, 56F e and 208P b and discuss the nuclear medium eﬀects, and compare them

obtained using various supernova ν(¯ν) ﬂuxes given by Totani et al. [19], Duan et al. [31] and Gava et al. [32]. In
subsections III C and III D, we present, respectively, the results for angular distribution and energy distribution of
electrons (positrons) produced in the charged current reactions using the above ﬂuxes.

A. Total cross-section

We present and discuss the eﬀect of nuclear medium including nucleon correlations on the cross-sections using LFG

model for the charged current as well as for the neutral current induced reactions.

I. In Fig.(4), we have shown the results for the total scattering cross-section per nucleon in 12C, 16O, 40Ar, 56F e

and 208P b for νe(¯νe)-induced charged current quasielastic process. We observe that:

i. For the case of νe-induced scattering on low mass targets like 12C and 16O (left panel), the reduction in
the cross-section due to the nuclear medium eﬀects like Pauli blocking and Fermi motion is around 98% at
N cross-section. The inclusion of
Eν = 20 MeV and 90% at Eν = 50 MeV in comparison to the free νe −
RPA correlation further reduces the cross-section by 66% at Eν= 20 MeV and by 55% at Eν = 50 MeV.
In the case of charged current νe-induced processes in high mass target like 40Ar(56F e) nucleus, the
reduction in the cross-section due to the nuclear eﬀects like Pauli blocking and Fermi motion is around
68(80)% at Eν = 20 MeV and 64(72)% at Eν= 50 MeV in comparison to the results obtained for the free
nucleon case. The inclusion of RPA correlations results in a further reduction in the cross-section, which
is 60(64)% at 20 MeV and 58(60)% at 50 MeV while in 208P b, this reduction is around 14% at Eν= 20
MeV and 40% at Eν = 50 MeV in comparison to the results obtained for the free nucleon which becomes
66% at 20 MeV and 65% at 50 MeV when RPA correlation is also incorporated.

ii. For the case of ¯νe-induced scattering on 12C and 16O (right panel), the cross-section almost reduced by
half at Eν = 20 MeV and by 95% at Eν = 50 MeV in comparison to the results obtained for the free nucleon
case. The additional reduction in the cross-section due to the RPA correlation is 50% at 20 MeV, which
becomes 45% at 50 MeV.

15

In the case of charged current ¯νe-induced process in 40Ar(56F e), the reduction in the cross-section is almost
N cross-section. The
by half at Eν = 20 MeV and by 95% at Eν= 50 MeV in comparison to the free νe −
cross-section further reduces by 16(14)% at 20 MeV, and 30(40)% at 50 MeV due to RPA correlations. In
the case of 208P b nuclear target, the cross-section reduces by half at Eν= 20 MeV and
98% at Eν = 50

II. In Fig.(5), we have compared our results of σ for νe charged current induced scattering with the results of σ
calculated by Volpe et al. [55] in 12C, Kuramoto et al.[77], Kolbe et al.[100] and Lazauskas et al. [65] in 16O,
Kolbe et al.[63], Vogel et al.[101] and Suzuki et al. [102] in 40Ar, Bandopadhayay et al.[103] and Kolbe et al.[104]
in 56F e and Engel et al. [47] and Paar et al.[105] in 208P b.

III. In Fig.(6), we have presented the results for σ in 40Ar and 208P b nuclear targets, as a function of Eν(¯ν), for the
neutral current induced processes using the expression of J µ given in Eq.(13) with the form factors deﬁned in
1,2(q2)=0 . We ﬁnd that the inclusion of RPA correlations reduces the cross-section by around
Eq.(32) with F s
60% at 10 MeV and 55% at 40 MeV in 40Ar, while in 208P b, this reduction is a bit larger, for example, at 10
MeV, this reduction is 70% which becomes 65% at 40 MeV. The reduction in the case of antineutrino-induced
process in 40Ar is 60% at 10 MeV and 56% at 40 MeV and in case of lead, it is 70% at 10 MeV and 66% at 40
MeV.
In Fig.(7), we have also presented the results for the total scattering cross-section in 208P b for the neutral current
neutrino induced process and compared them with the results obtained by Engel et al.[47] (dashed line), Kolbe
et al. [104] (dotted line) and Jachowicz et al. [106](dashed-dotted line).
We ﬁnd that our results for the total cross-sections in the various nuclei like 12C, 16O, 40Ar and 56F e are in
fair agreement with the other calculations except in the case of 208P b where the results for the charged current
induced reactions are lower than the results of Engelet al. [47] and Paar et al. [71]. In the case of neutral current
induced reactions, our results are higher than the results of Jachowicz et al. [59], but are in reasonable agreement
with the results of Kolbe et al. [57] and Engel et al. [47] within 10-15% for the energy range of 20-60 MeV.
The results for the antineutrino-nucleus cross-sections are qualitatively similar to the results of neutrino-nucleus
cross-section and within 15-20% of the results of Jachowicz et al. [59] and Kolbe et al. [57].

Our approach of calculating inclusive cross-sections in the local density approximation is similar to the closure
approximation where all the excitations to the ﬁnal states are summed over. The information about the nuclear
structure is simulated through the nuclear density of the initial state described by the density parameters ﬁxed
by the electron scattering data. The eﬀect of nucleon correlations and meson exchange currents (MEC) are
included through RPA using a nucleon-nucleon potential, with π and ρ exchanges along with a phenomenological
Landau-Migdal parameter to account for the short range correlations. This is an approximate and simple way
to describe the nuclear medium eﬀects and reproduces correctly the quenching of nuclear response function in
the spin-isospin channel. This method has been quite successfully applied to describe the inclusive processes
induced by the photons, electrons and muon capture in medium and heavy nuclei. On the other hand, the
other papers cited in this work use some explicit model of the nucleon-nucleon interaction to construct the
initial and ﬁnal states to calculate the various transitions to the ground state and the higher excited states
induced by the Fermi transition, Gamow-Teller(GT) transition as well as to the higher forbidden transitions.
The dominant GT transitions are calculated using a shell model or HFB wave functions for ground state and
low lying excited states using nucleon-nucleon potential. The strength of the eﬀective weak magnetic and axial
couplings are obtained using the phenomenological values of quenching determined experimentally from the
electron scattering in the case of vector transitions using CVC and the low energy experimental data on the p-n
reactions in the case of axial vector transitions. The transitions to the higher forbidden states are calculated by
the various authors using diﬀerent variants of RPA and with the diﬀerent nucleon-nucleon potentials. The use
of the diﬀerent potentials as well as the diﬀerent models of RPA brings uncertainty in the prediction of the total
cross-sections which is generally about 20%, but could be as large as a factor of 2 in some cases as discussed
recently by Balasi et al. [107] and Paar et al. [71, 72]. In a nucleus like 208P b, there is an additional uncertainty
arising due to the treatment of Coulomb eﬀect which could be large specially in the low energy region of Eν < 50
MeV [71]. In view of the above scenario regarding the uncertainty in the theoretical results due to the nuclear
medium eﬀects, our results in a simple model presented in Figs. 6-8 for the various nuclei could be considered
in agreement with the calculations using explicit nuclear wave functions.

We have also calculated the total scattering cross-section for the neutral current induced processes using the
expression of J µ given in Eq.(13) with the form factors deﬁned in Eq.(32) with F s
A(0)=-0.12
in Eq.(36), as well as with the nonstandard interaction using Eq. (37) without the presence of the strangeness
form factors, and presented the results in Fig.(8). We ﬁnd that the eﬀect of including the strangeness form

1,2(q2)=0 and F s

factors, the cross-section for the protons in 208
82 P b increases by about 20% and the cross-section for the neutrons
in 208
82 P b decreases by about 10% from the results without the strangeness contribution but the overall eﬀect in
the nuclear targets (protons and neutrons taken together) is very small (< 1%). The inclusion of NSI interaction
results in a signiﬁcant change in the cross-section. For example, with ǫuV
µe =0.05 in Eq. 37, the results
of the cross-section for the protons in 208
82 P b,
and the overall eﬀect in 208
82 P b is a decrease in the cross-section by about 28%. Quantitatively, the contribution
of the NSI to the total cross-section is sensitive to the numerical values used for ǫu,dV
and would be small for
medium nuclei with smaller neutron excess.

82 P b increases by 10% and decreases by 45% for the neutrons in 208

B. Flux-averaged cross-section and event rates

The ﬂux-averaged cross-section for the Michel spectrum (Eq.(23)) and the pion decay in ﬂight νµ spectrum [98]
(Eq.(21)) have been calculated and the results are shown in Fig.(4) for 12C and 56F e. In Table II, we show our results
for the ﬂux-averaged cross-sections and compare them with the experimental results where the available and some
theoretical results reported in the literature [51, 58, 80, 82, 83, 98, 104, 108–113]. We see that the present model of
including various nuclear medium eﬀects compares well with the other theoretical calculations and reproduces the
experimental results satisfactorily.

The success of our model exhibited in Table II in reproducing the ﬂux-averaged cross-sections for the low energy
neutrinos has encouraged us to apply it to the supernova neutrinos/antineutrinos. In Table III, we show our results for
the event rates using ﬂux-averaged cross-sections for supernova neutrinos/antineutrinos ﬂux spectra given by Totani
et al. [19], Duan et al. [31] and Gava et al. [32] using Eq.(23).

We see that there is a remarkable variation in the number of events due to the large variation in the three numerically
simulated supernova νe(¯νe) ﬂuxes considered here. For example, in the case of νe-induced process, event rate increases
when we use the ﬂux of Gava et al. [32] instead of Duan et al. [31]. However, there is further increment in the event
rates when one uses the ﬂux given by Totani et al. [19] as compared to Duan et al. [31]. We ﬁnd similar variation in
the event rates for ¯νe induced reactions in these nuclei.

In the case of 12C and 16O nuclear targets, we ﬁnd that for the ﬂux given by Gava et al. [32], the angular distribution
is larger than the distribution obtained using the ﬂux of Totani et al. [19], and there is remarkable variation in the
angular distribution if one uses the ﬂux of Duan et al. [31].

In the case of heavier mass target like 40Ar, 56F e and 208P b, angular distribution obtained by using the ﬂux given
by Gava et al. [32] is higher by a factor of around 10
15 than the distribution obtained by using the ﬂux of Duan et
al. [31]. While the angular distribution obtained by using the ﬂux of Totani et al. [19] is higher by a factor of around

The results obtained using the diﬀerent supernova νe and ¯νe ﬂuxes are compared with each other. We observe that
the lepton energy distribution (Fig.(10)) obtained by using the ﬂux given by Gava et al. [32] is much larger than the
distribution obtained by using the ﬂux given by Totani et al. [19] with an energy shift in the peak region in the case
of neutrino-induced process. It may also be observed that the distribution calculated using the ﬂux given by Duan et
al. [31] is small as compared to the distribution obtained by using the ﬂux of Gava et al. [32] and Totani et al. [19].
However, in the case for ¯νe induced process, we observe that the lepton energy distribution (Fig.(10)) obtained by

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have studied inclusive charged current and neutral current induced reactions for supernova neu-
trino/antineutrino in nuclei like 12C, 16O, 40Ar, 56F e and 208P b. The calculations are done using local Fermi gas
model which takes into account nuclear medium eﬀects due to Pauli blocking, Fermi motion as well as the renormal-
ization of weak transition strengths in the nuclear medium. The eﬀect of Coulomb distortion of the outgoing charged
lepton produced in the charged current reactions is taken into account by using the modiﬁed eﬀective momentum
approximation (MEMA) [84]. The model is shown to explain successfully the experimentally observed low energy
neutrino-nucleus cross-sections for 12C and 56F e in the case of neutrinos obtained from muons decay at rest(MDAR)
and pions decay in ﬂight (πDIF) at KARMEN [108], LSND [109] and LAMPF [110]. It is therefore quite suitable
method to study the low energy νe and ¯νe reactions in nuclei relevant for the supernova neutrino/antineutrino energies.
We have presented the numerical results for total cross-sections for neutrino/antineutrino induced charged current
and neutral current processes in 12C, 16O, 40Ar, 56F e and 208P b at low energies relevant for supernova νe and
¯νe. Using these cross-sections, the event rates are obtained for the charged lepton production for the theoretical
simulations available in the literature for supernova νe and ¯νe ﬂuxes given by Totani et al. [19], Duan et al. [31] and
Gava et al. [32]. We have also calculated ﬂux-averaged cross-section using the spectrum of the neutrino/antineutrino
for these spectra and the charged lepton event/sec corresponding to 1 kT of target material. The numerical results
for the angular distribution and energy distribution of the outgoing charged lepton produced in these reactions are
also presented.

We conclude that

(i) The nuclear medium eﬀects like Pauli blocking and Fermi motion eﬀects lead to substantial reduction in the
cross-section as compared to the free nucleon cross-section. The energy dependence of the reduction of the cross-
section due to nuclear medium eﬀects is quantitatively diﬀerent for neutrino and antineutrino induced processes.
The Q-values and the Coulomb eﬀect of charged lepton play an important role in quantitatively predicting the
cross-sections in 12C, 16O, 40Ar, 56F e and 208P b in the region of low energies relevant for the supernova νe and
¯νe. Our results of nuclear medium eﬀect on ν(¯ν)-nucleus cross-sections are in qualitative agreement with the
other calculations.

(ii) Large variations in the predicted ﬂuxes of supernova neutrino/antineutrino as obtained by the simulation anal-
ysis of Totani et al.
[32] lead to large variations in the various ob-
servables like event rates, angular and energy distributions of the charged leptons when averaged over the
neutrino/antineutrino ﬂuxes. A quantitative description of these observables has been presented for the case of
12C, 16O, 40Ar, 56F e and 208P b nuclei proposed to be used as detector material in future supernova neutrino
detectors.
