Abstract

A transverse deﬂecting structure (TDS) is a well-known device for characterizing the longitudinal properties of an electron
bunch in a linear accelerator. The standard use of such a cavity involves streaking the bunch along a transverse axis and
analysing the image on a screen downstream to ﬁnd the bunch length and slice properties along the other transverse axis.
A novel X-band deﬂecting structure, which will allow the polarization of the deﬂecting ﬁeld to be adjusted, is currently
being designed as part of a collaboration between CERN, DESY and PSI. This new design will allow bunches to be
streaked at any transverse angle within the cavity, which will open up the possibility of new measurement techniques,
which could be combined to characterize the 6D phase space distribution of bunches. In this paper, a method is presented
for reconstructing the longitudinal phase space distribution of bunches by using the TDS in combination with a dipole.
Simulations of this technique for the SINBAD-ARES beamline are presented and the key limitations related to temporal
resolution and induced energy spread are discussed.

1. Introduction

The ARES linac, currently under construction at DESY,
will form an integral part of the SINBAD R&D facility [1].
Using S-band travelling wave structures, it will be capa-
ble of producing sub-femtosecond electron bunches with
energies of up to 100 MeV and an arrival time stability of
10 fs [2, 3]. These bunches will be optimized for injection
into novel accelerating structures, such as dielectric laser
acceleration (DLA) structures [4, 5] and plasma cells for
laser-driven plasma wakeﬁeld acceleration (LPWA) [6].

In order to characterize the bunches after the linac, a
novel X-band transverse deﬂecting structure (TDS) with
variable polarization will be installed. This new design for
a TDS is based on X-Band RF technology developed at
CLIC [7] and allows bunches to be streaked at any trans-
verse angle within the cavity, which opens up the pos-
sibility of new measurement techniques. The cavity will
be manufactured at PSI using a high-precision tuning-free
manufacturing procedure [8]. Several cavities will be pro-
duced for a number of facilities at DESY and for Swiss-
FEL, with installation of the cavity at ARES expected in
2019-2020 [9]. The design of the TDS at ARES will con-
sist of two 0.8-metre cavities operating at a frequency of

11.9916 GHz, which together will be able to provide a com-
bined transverse deﬂection voltage of over 40 MV. These
cavities will be installed at the end of the magnetic com-
pressor chicane, as shown in the schematic of the ARES
linac in Fig. 1.

This X-band TDS will allow sub-femtosecond bunch
lengths to be measured at ARES. In addition, by combin-
ing the TDS with a dipole, a measurement can be made
of the slice energy of the bunch [10, 11]. The variable po-
larization also permits some measurement techniques that
are not possible with a conventional TDS. A method has
been proposed to reconstruct the charge density distribu-
tion of bunches by streaking them at a number of diﬀerent
angles and combining the projected proﬁles at a screen
using tomographic reconstruction techniques [12]. Addi-
tionally, by scanning over the magnetic ﬁeld strength of
quadrupoles placed downstream of the TDS, the trans-
verse phase space distributions can be reconstructed. Fig-
ure 2 shows a schematic for the lattice design of the TDS
section, including screens, quadrupoles and a dipole.

These measurements are particularly challenging for the
working points at ARES due to the short bunch lengths
(down to sub-fs) and the relatively low energy of the beam
(up to 100 MeV), which means space charge eﬀects are of-
ten non-negligible and the induced energy spread in the
cavities is signiﬁcant for the voltage kick required to ac-
curately resolve the bunches. In this paper, some of these

challenges are discussed with reference to the reconstruc-
tion of the longitudinal phase space.

There are many possible applications for this measure-
ment of the longitudinal phase space at ARES. It could
be useful in the context of DLA experiments, for example
to measure microbunching structures [4]. It could also be
used to measure the energy distribution in a bunch before
injection into a plasma cell.

The structure of this paper is as follows: in the follow-
ing section, the theory of transverse deﬂection is intro-
duced and theoretical limitations are discussed. Section 3
discusses the various working points under consideration
and the feasibility of reconstructing the longitudinal phase
space given these limitations. In Sec. 4, simulation results
are presented to illustrate the technique and ﬁnally Sec. 5
includes some concluding remarks and plans for further
studies.

2. Theory

A TDS imparts a time-dependent transverse kick on an
electron bunch. The rms spot size on a screen located at
longitudinal position s1 is therefore a combination of the
spot size on the screen when the TDS is switched oﬀ, σoﬀ
y ,
and a contribution due to the TDS streaking:

(cid:113)

σy(s1) =

(σoﬀ

y )2 + (Scσt)2.

(1)

Here, σt is the rms bunch length at the TDS in seconds, c
is the speed of light and S is the shear parameter, deﬁned

as

S = M y
1,2

2πf eV0
c2|p|

,

(2)

where M y is the vertical transfer matrix from the centre of
the TDS to the screen, f and V0 are the cavity frequency
and peak voltage respectively, and p is the mean momen-
tum [10]. It has been assumed that the TDS is operated
at zero-crossing. The shear parameter relates the shift in
position of a particle on the screen, ∆y, to its position
along the bunch relative to the central particle, ζ [10]:

∆y ≈ Sζ.

(3)

In general,

(cid:113)

M y

1,2 =

βy(s0)βy(s1) sin ∆φy,

(4)

where βy(s0) and βy(s1) are the β-functions at the centre
of the TDS and the screen respectively, and ∆φy is the
phase advance between these two locations. The temporal
resolution is deﬁned here as the bunch length in seconds
when the two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) are
equal, and can therefore be expressed as

Rt ≈

√
(cid:15)y
(cid:112)βy(s0)| sin(∆φy)|

|p|c
2πf eV0

,

(5)

where (cid:15)y is the vertical geometric emittance of the bunch.
In order to reconstruct the slice bunch energy distribu-
tion, a TDS can be combined with a dipole deﬂecting in
the other axis (deﬁned here as the x axis). The theoreti-
cal resolution achievable for a dipole spectrometer depends
on the horizontal geometric emittance ((cid:15)x), horizontal β-
function (βx) and dispersion (D) at the screen, according
to the relation [14]

From this matrix, it can be seen that the TDS induces a
linear energy chirp given by

(9)

There are many contributions to the uncorrelated induced
energy spread. In the limit L → 0, the dominant term is

σδ = Kσy (s0) .

(10)

As this term is just a function of K and σy, it can be calcu-
lated easily and, in principle, can also be measured exper-
imentally by scanning over the voltage. There are other
terms involved for a longer TDS, which may, in combina-
tion, be non-negligible for the TDS at ARES. Estimating
these terms would, however, be very challenging. Using
the shear parameter deﬁned in Eq. (2), it can be shown
that [14]

Rtσδ >

.

(11)

This important result places an intrinsic limit on the prod-
uct of the uncorrelated energy spread and the longitudinal
resolution. It shows that a better longitudinal resolution
can only be obtained when a larger energy spread is in-
duced in the TDS.

3. Consideration of working points

There are many working points under consideration for
operation of the ARES linac, with bunch charge ranging
from sub-pC to around 50 pC and bunch lengths down to
sub-fs scales. Beam parameters at the chicane exit for sev-
eral working points obtained from start-to-end simulations
of the linac are shown in Table 1 [13].

Using the inequality in (11), a criterion can be found
to determine whether the longitudinal phase space can be
reconstructed accurately. If the induced uncorrelated en-
ergy spread in the TDS, σδ, exceeds the correlated energy
spread of the input bunch, the measurement will be dom-
inated by the energy perturbation in the TDS and so it
becomes diﬃcult to retrieve the initial longitudinal phase
space distribution.

Assuming a linear energy chirp along the bunch, h, the
initial rms correlated energy spread can be expressed as
hcσt, where σt is the initial rms bunch length in seconds.
Imposing the requirement that this rms correlated energy
spread must be greater than σδ, we arrive at the condition

Rref

t >

(cid:15)y
|h|c2σt

.

(12)

This gives a reference longitudinal resolution, which can
be compared to the rms bunch length for an indication
of the ease of reconstruction. If this reference resolution
is much shorter than the rms bunch length, an accurate
reconstruction of the initial phase space should generally
be possible, whereas if it is much longer, it is unlikely that
the initial phase space can be reconstructed accurately.

Using this inequality, it can be shown that reconstruct-
ing the longitudinal phase space of WP1 and WP2 accu-
rately would be extremely challenging. In these cases, it
would probably be better to turn oﬀ the ﬁeld in the TDS
and perform a simple spectrometer measurement of the to-
tal bunch rms energy spread instead. WP5 is an example
that is approaching the limit for accurate reconstruction
and has been used for simulations presented in the follow-
ing section.

4. Simulations

Simulations were carried out in elegant [16] using WP5
in Table 1. They do not include space charge and use a
1D CSR model. The transverse beam parameters at the
TDS entrance are shown in Table 2. The bunch is ﬁrst
streaked in the vertical direction in the TDS, and then in
the horizontal direction in the dipole. The TDS is oper-
ated at zero-crossing.
In order to minimize the induced
energy spread in the TDS, which is proportional to the
voltage as shown in Eq. (10), a voltage kick of just 2 MV
per cavity (i.e. 4 MV in total) is used. This was found to
be a good compromise between induced energy spread and
longitudinal resolution.

The setup consists of two quadrupoles for matching pur-
poses, a dipole and a screen placed perpendicular to the
beam leaving the dipole. The dipole is assumed to be
a long rectangular magnet. The beam enters perpendic-
ularly near the edge and leaves through the side of the
magnet. Assuming a ﬁeld strength of 1.4 T, the arc length
through the dipole is 0.268 m and the bending angle is
1.331 rad.

There are several constraints in the matching process.
In the y direction, a phase shift of around π/2 is desired
to optimize the longitudinal resolution, as can be seen in
Eq. (5). In the x direction, a large dispersion and small
βx at the screen is sought to optimize the energy reso-

lution (from Eq. (6)). The ﬁnal constraint is that the
transverse beam size must be a sensible size on the screen.
Figure 3 shows the lattice used, which has been matched
with respect to these conditions. The screen is placed
0.17 m after the dipole exit, which was set as the mini-
mum possible distance for technical reasons. Using these
settings, the theoretical value for the longitudinal reso-
lution is 3.4 fs, whereas the theoretical energy resolution
(∆E/E0) is 4 × 10−5.

Figure 4a shows the simulated screen image as a density
proﬁle. The y coordinate at the screen has been converted
to arrival time (∆t) by means of the shear parameter, as
given by Eq. (3), which has been obtained by a simulated
phase scan at the cavity. The x coordinate has been con-
verted to energy deviation (∆E) by Taylor expanding to
ﬁrst order the following relation obtained by geometrical
arguments:

∆xs =

(cid:20)
d0 + (ρ1 sin θ1 − ρ0 sin θ0)

(cid:21)

sin θ1
sin(θ0 − θ1)

tan(θ0−θ1),

(13)
where ∆xs is the x coordinate at the screen with respect
to the reference trajectory, d0 is the distance between the
exit of the dipole and the screen, ρ0 and ρ1 are the ref-
erence and oﬀset bending radii respectively, and θ0 and
θ1 are the reference and oﬀset bending angles respectively.
The weighted mean and standard deviation of this distri-
bution are shown as error bars, with spacing given by the
theoretical longitudinal resolution.

The induced energy spread, calculated using Eq. (9) and
(10), is shown in Fig. 4b as squares with error bars. The
total standard deviation is given by

is the original rms energy spread and σind

inal rms energy spread can be recovered, which is shown
on the plot.

Figure 4c shows the original phase space distribution
with the reconstruction superposed. The discrepancy in
the reconstruction can be largely attributed to the propa-
gation of the bunch between the TDS and the screen. As a
low voltage kick is used to limit the induced energy spread
in the TDS, the longitudinal resolution is low and there is
considerable mixing of the bunch slices, which alters the
longitudinal phase space distribution that is reconstructed
from the screen image. This aﬀects both the mean slice
energies and the standard deviations. The bunch used in
this simulation is approaching the limit of what can be
accurately reproduced, however it can be seen that useful
information about the bunch properties can be extracted
nevertheless.

5. Conclusion

A novel X-band TDS with variable polarization is cur-
rently being designed for installation on several beam-
lines, including the ARES linac at the SINBAD facility
at DESY. This structure will allow measurements of time-
dependent bunch properties, including the energy distribu-
tion discussed here. By combining the TDS with a dipole
and matching appropriately with quadrupoles, the longi-
tudinal phase space of the bunch can be reconstructed in
a single-shot measurement. This measurement is challeng-
ing due to the energy spread induced in the TDS. There
is an intrinsic limit on the minimum of the product of the
longitudinal resolution and the induced uncorrelated en-
ergy spread, which arises from the Panofsky-Wenzel theo-
rem. Therefore, for some of the working points considered
for the ARES beamline, an accurate reconstruction of the
longitudinal phase space is not viable, and a standard spec-
trometer measurement with the TDS oﬀ should be carried
out instead.

A simulation of this measurement and subsequent lon-
gitudinal phase space reconstruction has been presented
here for an ARES bunch. To limit the induced energy
spread to acceptable levels, the combined voltage kick has
been reduced to 4 MV. The reconstruction agrees with the
input distribution well enough to make it a useful measure-
ment, and the discrepancies can be explained by the low
temporal resolution and induced energy spread.

Further work will

involve integrating collective ef-
fects into the simulations, particularly for the higher
charge/current working points. In addition, further stud-
ies are needed to combine this measurement with others
mentioned in the introduction to characterize the 6D phase
space of electron bunches.

(b) Calculated means and standard deviations from the
ﬁgure above are shown. The calculated induced energy
spread is subtracted to give the reconstructed points.
