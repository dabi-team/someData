ABSTRACT

In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the C4.2 circular-

ribbon ﬂare in active region (AR) 12434 on 2015 October 16. The short-lived ﬂare

was associated with positive magnetic polarities and a negative polarity inside, as

revealed by the photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms. Such magnetic pattern

is strongly indicative of a magnetic null point and spine-fan conﬁguration in the

corona. The ﬂare was triggered by the eruption of a mini-ﬁlament residing in

the AR, which produced the inner ﬂare ribbon (IFR) and the southern part of a

closed circular ﬂare ribbon (CFR). When the eruptive ﬁlament reached the null

point, it triggered null point magnetic reconnection with the ambient open ﬁeld

and generated the bright CFR and a blowout jet. Raster observations of the

Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ) show plasma upﬂow at speed of

35−120 km s−1 in the Fe xxi 1354.09 ˚A line (log T ≈ 7.05) and downﬂow at speed

of 10−60 km s−1 in the Si iv 1393.77 ˚A line (log T ≈ 4.8) at certain locations

of the CFR and IFR during the impulsive phase of ﬂare, indicating explosive

chromospheric evaporation. Coincidence of the single HXR source at 12−25 keV

with the IFR and calculation based on the thick-target model suggest that the

explosive evaporation was most probably driven by nonthermal electrons.

Introduction

Solar ﬂares are impulsive increases of emissions in various wavelengths from radio

to hard X-ray (HXR) in the solar atmosphere (Benz 2008; Fletcher et al. 2011). Within

tens of minutes to several hours, the free magnetic energies (1029−1032 ergs) accumulated

before the ﬂares are released and converted into the kinetic and thermal energies via

magnetic reconnection (Priest & Forbes 2000; Su et al. 2013). In the thick-target model,

the accelerated nonthermal electrons (20−100 keV) are precipitated downward in the much

denser chromosphere, leading to impulsive heating of the local plasma up to ∼10 MK

and rapid increase in HXR emissions via Coulomb collisions (Brown 1971; Cheng et al.

2010). When the heating timescale is much shorter than the radiative cooling timescale,

the overpressure of the chromosphere pumps hot plasma into the newly reconnected

coronal loops that emit strong emissions in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray

(SXR), a process called chromospheric evaporation (Fisher et al. 1985a,b,c; Mariska et al.

1989; Emslie et al. 1992; Abbett & Hawley 1999; Allred et al. 2005, 2015). So far, it has

been extensively investigated using both HXR imaging (Liu et al. 2006; Ning et al. 2009)

and spectroscopic observations in Hα, EUV, and SXR wavelengths (Acton et al. 1982;

Czaykowska et al. 1999; Brosius & Phillips 2004; Young et al. 2013; Polito et al. 2015,

2016). Liu et al. (2006) studied the spatial evolution of the HXR emissions during the

impulsive phase of an M1.7 ﬂare. They found that the HXR emission centroids move from

the footpoint toward the loop top at speed of hundreds of km s−1, which is indicative of

continuous chromospheric evaporation as a result of the deposition of electron energies.

Chromospheric evaporations are divided into two types according to the level of energy

ﬂux (Fisher et al. 1985b). Explosive evaporation occurs when the input energy ﬂux exceeds

– 4 –

the critical value (∼1010 erg cm−2 s−1). Plasma upﬂows at speed of hundreds of km s−1

are observed in the emission lines formed in the coronal temperatures, while downﬂows

at speed of tens of km s−1 are observed in the emission lines formed in the transition

region and upper chromosphere (Brosius & Phillips 2004; Milligan et al. 2006b). The total

momentum of upﬂowing plasma is approximately equal to that of the downﬂowing plasma

or chromospheric condensation (Fisher 1987; Canﬁeld et al. 1990). Otherwise, gentle

evaporations take place accompanied by upﬂows at speed of tens of km s−1 in all emission

lines (Milligan et al. 2006a; Sadykov et al. 2015). Recently, Reep et al. (2015) investigated

the importance of electron energy on the two types of evaporation. They found that the

threshold between explosive and gentle evaporation is not ﬁxed at a given beam energy ﬂux.

Instead, it depends strongly on the electron energy and duration of heating. Occasionally,

conversions from impulsive type to gentle type or from gentle type to explosive type are

observed in diﬀerent phases of ﬂares (Brosius 2009; Li et al. 2015b).

Apart from the nonthermal electrons, thermal conduction also plays a role in driving

chromospheric evaporations (Zarro & Lemen 1988; Battaglia et al. 2009; Zhang & Ji 2013),

which has been explored in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations (e.g.,

Yokoyama & Shibata 1998; Brannon & Longcope 2014; Longcope 2014). Reep & Russell

(2016) discovered that Alfv´enic waves, propagating from the corona to the chromosphere,

can also heat the upper chromosphere and produce explosive evaporation. To date, the

dominant driving mechanism is still controversial (Wuelser et al. 1994; Raftery et al. 2009).

The successful launch of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al.

2014) telescope opened a new era for the study of ﬂare dynamics. Evidences of electron-

driven chromospheric evaporations have been reported using state-of-the-art observations

of IRIS (e.g., Battaglia et al. 2015; Graham & Cauzzi 2015; Li et al. 2015a,b; Tian et al.

2015).

– 5 –

In the context of standard ﬂare and coronal mass ejection (CME) model (e.g.,

Shibata et al. 1995; Lin et al. 2004), there are two parallel ﬂare ribbons where nonthermal

electrons collide and heat the chromosphere, which are observed in the Ca ii H, Hα, UV,

and EUV wavelengths. Apart from the two ribbons, a particular type of ﬂare ribbons, i.e.

circular ribbons, exist (Masson et al. 2009; Reid et al. 2012; Wang & Liu 2012; Jiang et al.

2013; Liu et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). They are

always associated with the spine-fan conﬁguration in the presence of magnetic null point,

which is a singular point where the magnetic ﬁeld vanishes (B = 0) (Lau & Finn 1990).

The magnetic ﬁeld B near the null point can be expressed as the linear term B = M · r,

where M is a Jacobian matrix with elements Mij = ∂Bi/∂xj and r is the position vector

(x, y, z)T centered at the null point (Parnell et al. 1996). The divergence-free condition

(∇ · B = 0) requires that the sum of the three eigenvalues equal to zero (Zhang et al. 2012).

The two eigenvectors corresponding to the two eigenvalues of the same sign determine the

fan surface, which divides the space into two regions having a distinct connectivity. The

third eigenvector corresponding to the third eigenvalue of the opposite sign determines

the direction of spines passing through the null point. Magnetic reconnection and particle

acceleration in null point reconnection regions have been explored in analytical study

(Priest & Titov 1996; Litvinenko 2004) and three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations

(Rosdahl & Galsgaard 2010; Baumann et al. 2013a,b). The circular ribbons are believed

to be intersections of the fan surfaces and the chromosphere. The central or inner ribbons

within the circular ribbons are thought to be intersections of the inner spines and the

chromosphere (Wang & Liu 2012; Reid et al. 2012). Sometimes, there are multiple ﬂare

ribbons owing to the extraordinarily complex magnetic topology of the active regions (ARs;

Joshi et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2015).

So far, chromospheric evaporations in circular-ribbon ﬂares have rarely been observed

and investigated, especially by IRIS. Although signiﬁcant improvements in understanding

– 6 –

the chromospheric evaporations have been achieved, there are still open questions need to

be addressed: How is the circular-ribbon ﬂares generated? Are there explosive or gentle

chromospheric evaporations in circular-ribbon ﬂares? What is the cause of evaporation? In

this paper, we report the multiwavelength imaging and spectral observations of the GOES

C4.2 circular-ribbon ﬂare in NOAA AR 12434 (S10E37), which is one of the homologous

ﬂares on 2015 October 16. Data analysis and results of the ﬁlament eruption and ﬂare are

shown in Section 2. Data analysis and results of the explosive chromospheric evaporations

in the circular ﬂare ribbon (CFR) and inner ﬂare ribbon (IFR) are presented in Section 3.

Discussion and summary are arranged in Section 4 and Section 5.

2. Filament eruption and circular-ribbon ﬂare

2.1. Observation and data analysis

The ﬂare was observed by the ground-based telescope of the Global Oscillation

Network Group (GONG) in Hα line center and by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly

(AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) aboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) in 1600 ˚A and

EUV wavelengths (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, 335 ˚A). The photospheric line-of-sight

(LOS) magnetograms were observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI;

Scherrer et al. 2012) aboard SDO. The level 1 data from AIA and HMI were calibrated

using the SSW programs aia prep.pro and hmi prep.pro, respectively. To locate where the

nonthermal particles precipitate, we made HXR images using the CLEAN method with

integration time of 120 s at diﬀerent energy bands of the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar

Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI ; Lin et al. 2002). The images observed in Hα, UV, EUV,

and HXR wavelengths were coaligned with accuracy of ∼0.′′6. The observing parameters of

the instruments are summarized in Table 1.

– 7 –

2.2. Results

Figure 1 shows the 171 ˚A image observed by AIA and the LOS magnetogram observed

by HMI at ∼13:39 UT. The ﬂare occurred in the AR 12434, which is characterized by

large-scale coronal arcade. In panel (b), the inset colored image shows the close-up of the

ﬂare region, which is characterized by a central negative polarity (N) surrounded by the

positive polarities (P).

Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of the ﬂare in 304 ˚A. Before the ﬂare, a very

small ﬁlament, which is indicated by the arrows, resided in the AR (see panels (a)-(b)). As

time goes on, the dark mini-ﬁlament activated and generated elongated, jet-like brightening

at ∼13:35. After 13:37:30 UT, the ﬁlament erupted impulsively and generated the C4.2

ﬂare, which features a CFR (see panels (e)-(f) and online movie anim304.mpg). Meanwhile,

the cool ﬁlament was heated signiﬁcantly. In panel (f), the brightest region in the southwest

of CFR coincides with the single HXR source at 12−25 keV. The rising and expanding

ﬁlament became a curtain-like, blowout jet after 13:39:30 UT. Moore et al. (2010) classiﬁed

the coronal jets into the standard type and blowout type. The standard type has simpler

morphology and can be explained by the magnetic emerging-ﬂux model (Shibata et al.

1992). The blowout type, however, results from small-scale ﬁlament eruptions accompanied

by rotating and/or transverse drifting motions (e.g., Pariat et al. 2009; Moore et al.

2013; Zhang & Ji 2014; Kumar et al. 2016). In our work, the jet not only propagated

longitudinally, but also underwent transverse drift from west to east. Interestingly, the

brightening at the base of jet propagated in the counterclockwise direction along the CFR.

In panel (g), the contours of the positive and negative LOS magnetic ﬁelds are superposed

with magenta and green lines, respectively. As mentioned above in Figure 1(b), the negative

polarity (N) is surrounded by positive polarities (P), which strongly implies the existence

of magnetic null point and spine-fan conﬁguration in the upper atmosphere (Zhang et al.

– 8 –

2012, 2015). The CFR is approximately cospatial with the positive polarities, while the

IFR is approximately cospatial with the negative polarity. In panels (h) and (i), the short

and bright IFR within the CFR is cospatial with the HXR source.

The evolution of ﬂare observed in Hα is displayed in the top panels of Figure 3 with

lower resolution. The pre-existing dark ﬁlament, which was ∼15′′ away from the sunspot,

kept stable until ∼13:35 UT. It erupted and generated the blowout jet and cicular-ribbon

ﬂare (see the online movie animha.mpg). The ﬁlament eruption and ﬂare were also evident

in the other wavelengths of AIA with higher formation temperatures. The rest panels of

Figure 3 demonstrate selected images observed by AIA. The 335 ˚A (log T ≈ 6.4) image

and 94 ˚A (log T ≈ 6.8) image are characterized by the hot post ﬂare loops (PFLs), which

connect the IFR and southern part of CFR. The eastern part of CFR is less evident in 94 ˚A

than in the other wavelengths, implying that the temperatures of the eastern part of CFR

were lower than the western part.

In order to investigate the evolution of the blowout jet, we selected two slices in

Figure 3(h): S1 along the jet axis and S2 across the axis. The time-slice diagrams of S1

and S2 in 171 ˚A are displayed in the left and right panels of Figure 4, respectively. The jet

started at ∼13:39 UT and propagated outwards along the axis at a speed of ∼308 km s−1.

Meanwhile, the jet underwent transverse drifting motion from west to east at a speed of

∼87 km s−1, which is much higher than the previously reported values (Moore et al. 2013).

In Figure 5, the upper panel shows the SXR light curves during 13:20−14:00 UT in

0.5−4 ˚A and 1−8 ˚A. The short-lived C4.2 ﬂare had lifetime of ∼15 minutes. It started at

∼13:36:30 UT, peaked at ∼13:42:31 UT, and ended at ∼13:51 UT. The HXR light curves

at various energy bands (3−6, 6−12, 12−25, 25−50, 50−100 keV) are plotted with colored

lines in the lower panel. The peak times at HXR energy bands preceded the SXR peak time

by 1−2 minutes, implying the Neupert eﬀect (Ning & Cao 2010).

3. Chromospheric evaporation in ﬂare ribbons

3.1. Observation and data analysis

Fortunately, the ﬂare was captured by IRIS Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) in 1400 ˚A and raster

observation in the “sparse synoptic raster” mode. Each raster had 36 steps from east to

west and covered an area of 35.′′5×181.′′5. The step cadence and exposure time were ∼9.4 s

and 7.1 s. Each step had a spatial size of ∼0.′′166 and a spectral scale of ∼25.6 m˚A pixel−1

in the far ultraviolet bands, which equals to ∼5.7 km s−1 pixel−1. The sixth raster data of

Fe xxi and Si iv lines during 13:37:29−13:43:00 UT were preprocessed using the standard

Solar Software (SSW) programs iris orbitvar corr l2.pro and iris prep despike.pro. The Fe

xxi line (log T ≈ 7.05) is blended with cold and narrow chromospheric lines, which should

be identiﬁed and removed using the multi-Gaussian ﬁtting method (Li et al. 2015a, 2016).

The line centers and widths of these blended lines are ﬁxed or constrained, while their

intensities are tied to speciﬁc species in adjacent spectral window. The raster observations

in this study lacked the spectral window “1343”, which includes the tied line at H2 1342.77

˚A. The two blended lines at 1353.32 ˚A and 1353.39 ˚A were too weak to contribute to the

Fe xxi, so that they were not considered in this ﬁtting. The Si iv line (log T ≈ 4.8) is an

isolated line, which can be well ﬁtted by the single-Gaussian function.

3.2. Results

Figure 6 shows the 1400 ˚A images observed by IRIS /SJI with extremely high resolution

during 13:31:23−13:46:28 UT (see online movie anim1400.mpg). The evolution of the

ﬂare is quite similar to that in 304 ˚A in Figure 2, featuring bright CFR and IFR with

ultraﬁne structures. The intensity of CFR did not increase simultaneously but in the

counterclockwise direction. Like in EUV and Hα wavelengths, the single HXR source is

– 10 –

exactly located at the IFR (see panel (g)). The two vertical dashed lines in panel (e) denote

the starting and ending positions of the 36-step raster observation, exactly covering the ﬂare

and jet during the impulsive phase. Since the slit and CFR intersects in two places during

the scan, we call the northern and southern intersections NCFR and SCFR, respectively. A

few selected points at the NCFR, SCFR, and IFR are displayed as green, blue, and magenta

pluses in panel (f).

The IRIS spectra windows of Fe xxi and Si iv at three times are shown in the left and

right panels of Figure 7, respectively. The spectra proﬁles and results of multi-Gaussian

ﬁtting of three points representative of NCFR, IFR, and SCFR are displayed in the left

panels. The ﬁtting results of Fe xxi spectra are drawn in turquoise lines. It is clear that the

line centers of the three points are blueshifted compared with the rest wavelength of Fe xxi

at 1354.09 ˚A (Li et al. 2015a, 2016), indicating upﬂows of super-hot plasma. The spectra

proﬁles and results of single-Gaussian ﬁtting of the same points are demonstrated in the

right panels. The spectra of a nonﬂaring region is used for determining the rest wavelength

of Si iv (1393.77 ˚A). It is evident that the line centers of the three points are redshifted

compared with the rest wavelength, indicating downﬂows of plasma with temperature of

∼0.063 MK.

The calculated Doppler velocities of the NCFR, SCFR, and IFR in Figure 6(f) are

plotted with diamonds, crosses, and boxes with error bars in Figure 8, respectively.

The simultaneous upﬂows at speed of 35−120 km s−1 in the high-temperature line and

downﬂows at speed of 10−60 km s−1 in the low-temperature line suggest that explosive

chromospheric evaporation took place in the CFR and IFR during the impulsive phase of

ﬂare (13:39−13:43 UT).

4. Discussion

4.1. How is the circular-ribbon ﬂare generated?

Owing to the rapid increases of spatial resolutions and observational data of the

space-borne telescopes, more and more circular-ribbon ﬂares have been observed and

reported (e.g., Masson et al. 2009; Reid et al. 2012; Wang & Liu 2012). Joshi et al. (2015)

studied the M7.3 ﬂare as a result of sigmoid eruption in a large-scale fan-spine-type

magnetic conﬁguration on 2014 April 18. The ﬂare consists of parallel ribbons and a

large-scale quasi-circular ribbon. To explain the observational aspects, the authors use

a multi-step magnetic reconnection: tether-cutting reconnection for the formation and

eruption of the sigmoid, standard reconnection in the wake of the erupting sigmoid for

the parallel ribbons, and null-type reconnection for the quasi-circular ribbon and blowout

jet, which is a 3D breakout-type eruption in nature and has been studied in the previous

numerical simulations of ﬂux rope eruptions and CMEs (Lynch et al. 2008, 2009). In

our work, the eruption could be understood as follows. First, the mini-ﬁlament became

unstable and rose as a result of tether-cutting reconnection, magnetic ﬂux emergence, or

ideal MHD instability (Zhang et al. 2015), which is out of the scope of this paper and will

be the main topic of the next paper. The slow activation was accompanied by small-scale

brightening and jet-like motion (see Figure 2(b)-(d)). The reconnection in the wake of

the erupting ﬁlament generated the IFR and SCFR, which can be considered as parallel

two ribbons (see Figure 2(e)). When the ﬁlament reached the null point, it reconnected

with the ambient ﬁeld and produced the blowout jet and bright CFR (see Figure 2(f)-(i)).

The accumulated twist in the ﬁlament was transferred to the ambient open ﬁeld during

the magnetic reconnection (Pariat et al. 2009; Moreno-Insertis & Galsgaard 2013). This is

consistent with the transverse drift of the jet and the sequential brightening of CFR in the

counterclockwise direction (see Figure 4(b) and Figure 6).

– 12 –

4.2. What is the cause of chromospheric evaporation?

Chromospheric evaporation is an important process in ﬂare dynamics and has been

extensively investigated. Explosive chromospheric evaporations in two-ribbon ﬂares

have been observed and reported (e.g., Czaykowska et al. 1999; Battaglia et al. 2015;

Graham & Cauzzi 2015; Li et al. 2015b; Tian et al. 2015). Li et al. (2015a) explored

the relationship between HXR emissions and Doppler velocities caused by the explosive

chromospheric evaporation in two X1.6 ﬂares on 2014 September 10 and October 22. The

correlations between the HXR emissions and Doppler shifts of Fe xxi and C i (log T ≈ 4.0)

suggest that the explosive evaporations in the ﬂares are driven by electrons. Battaglia et al.

(2015) studied the chromospheric evaporations of the X1.0 ﬂare on 2014 March 29. They

found that the locations of HXR footpoint sources were coincident with the locations of

upﬂow in part of the southern ribbon during the peak of the ﬂare. During the decay phase,

the evaporation was probably driven by energy ﬂux via thermal conduction. They concluded

that electron beam may play a role only in driving the chromospheric evaporation during

the initial phases of ﬂare. In our study, explosive evaporation took place not only in the

CFR, but also in the IFR. The single HXR source was cospatial with the IFR, meaning that

the explosive evaporation was most probably driven by nonthermal electrons accelerated

by the ﬂare (see Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 6). It should be emphasized that the

integration time of the HXR images is 120 s, which is longer than that in Battaglia et al.

(2015). We have tried making HXR images using 60 s integration time and found that the

time and location of HXR source are the same. The HXR images, however, became more

dispersive due to the lower photon count rate and signal-to-noise ratio.

In order to justify our conjecture of electron-driven evaporation, we made HXR

spectrum during the impulsive phase of ﬂare. The 4-min integration time (13:38−13:42

UT) is suﬃcient to get a higher signal-to-noise ratio and smaller error bars. The spectrum

– 13 –

and results of two-component ﬁtting are displayed in Figure 9. The spectra for thermal

component and power-law nonthermal component are drawn in dot-dashed and dashed

lines. The thermal temperature (T ) and emission measure (EM) are ∼28 MK and 2×1046

cm−3. The power-law slope or spectral index (γ) of the HXR photons is ∼2.1. Therefore,

the electron spectral index δ = γ + 1 = 3.1. The total nonthermal power Ptot above a
cut-oﬀ energy Ec is 1.16×1024γ3I1(Ec/E1)−(γ−1) erg s−1, where I1 denotes the photon count
rate (Aschwanden 2004). For the C4.2 ﬂare, assuming that I1 = 103 photon s−1 cm−2 and
Ec = E1 = 20 keV, Ptot is estimated to be 1.1×1028 erg s−1. Considering that the area
of HXR source is in the range of 2.6 × 1017 − 1.1 × 1018 cm2 (see Figure 2(h)), the total

nonthermal energy ﬂux is 1×1010−4×1010 erg s−1 cm−2, which is greater than the threshold

for explosive chromospheric evaporation (Fisher et al. 1985b). Therefore, the explosive

evaporation in our study is most probably driven by nonthermal electrons. Polito et al.

(2015) studied the C6.5 ﬂare on 2014 February 3 and found that blueshifted (>80 km

s−1) proﬁles of the Fe xxi appear at the very early phase of ﬂare and gradually decrease

to 15 km s−1 in ∼6 minutes, which is in agreement with the prediction of chromospheric

evaporation by the 1D hydrodynamic ﬂare model. In our study, the velocities of the upﬂow

range from 35 to 120 km s−1, which is roughly consistent with the results of Polito et al.

(2015). However, the raster observation of IRIS was in the “sparse synoptic raster” mode

instead of “sit and stare” mode on 2015 October 16, so that we can not study the spectral

evolution of the same ﬂare location.

Although we did not carry out magnetic extrapolation based on the photospheric

magnetograms since the AR was close to the limb, the CFR surrounding the IFR in

Figure 2(g) and the HMI LOS magnetogram in Figure 1(b) strongly suggest the existence

of a null point and spine-fan topology in the corona (Masson et al. 2009; Reid et al. 2012;

Wang & Liu 2012; Joshi et al. 2015). Baumann et al. (2013a) studied the mechanism

of particle acceleration in coronal 3D null point reconnection region, ﬁnding that sub-

– 14 –

relativistic electrons are accelerated by a systematic electric ﬁeld in the current sheet. The

impact regions of the high-energy electrons in the chromosphere agree well with previous

observations. In this work, we are not sure whether the electrons are accelerated by

electric ﬁeld or not. Quantitative calculations are required in the future. Besides, explosive

evaporation took place at certain locations (see Figure 6(f)), though the raster covered the

whole CFR and IFR. There are credible redshifts in the Si iv line at the other locations of

CFR. However, the intensities of the Fe xxi are too weak and the uncertainties of velocities

are too large. Magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration mechanism are tightly related

to the magnetic conﬁguration, and the precipitation of nonthermal electrons along the CFR

may not be uniform and isotropic (Rosdahl & Galsgaard 2010; Baumann et al. 2013a). The

temperatures of chromosphere at the other locations are probably raised to a few 105−106

K by limited ﬂux of electrons, which is far less than the formation temperatures of Fe xxi

(∼11 MK) and AIA 94 ˚A (> 6 MK) in Figure 3(h).

5. Summary

In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the C4.2 circular-ribbon

ﬂare by ground-based telescope, SDO/AIA, IRIS, GOES, and RHESSI on 2015 October 16

in AR 12434. The main results are summarized as follows:

1. The short-lived ﬂare was associated with a negative magnetic polarity surrounded

by positive polarities in the photosphere, which is strongly indicative of a magnetic

null point and the fan-spine conﬁguration in the corona. A mini-ﬁlament residing in

the AR erupted, generating the IFR and SCFR, which can be considered as a pair of

parallel ribbons.

– 15 –

2. When the ﬁlament reached the null point, it triggered magnetic reconnection with

the ambient open ﬁeld near the null point and generated the closed CFR and a

blowout jet. The IFR and CFR were cospatial with the negative polarity and positive

polarities. The CFR brightening was sequential in the counterclockwise direction in

the IRIS /SJI images. The blowout jet moved along the axis at a speed of ∼308 km

s−1. Meanwhile, it drifted from west to east across the axis at a speed of ∼87 km s−1.

3. During the impulsive phase of the ﬂare, there were plasma upﬂow in the hot Fe xxi

line at speed of 35−120 km s−1 and downﬂow in the cool Si iv line at speed of 10−60

km s−1 in the IFR and CFR, indicating explosive chromospheric evaporation during

4. The IFR was cospatial with the single HXR source at 12−25 keV. Calculation based

on the thick-target model suggests that the explosive evaporation was most probably

driven by nonthermal electrons. Whether the electrons were accelerated by electric

ﬁeld in the current sheet during the magnetic reconnection is still unclear. Additional

case studies combined with 3D numerical simulations are required in the future.
