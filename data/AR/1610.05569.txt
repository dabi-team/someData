Transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations in
Ar+Sc collisions at the CERN SPS from NA61/SHINE∗

The NA61/SHINE experiment aims to discover the critical point of
strongly interacting matter and study the properties of the onset of de-
conﬁnement. For these goals a scan of the two dimensional phase diagram
(T -µB) is being performed at the SPS by measurements of hadron produc-
tion in proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions as
a function of collision energy and system size.
In this contribution pre-
liminary results on transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations ex-
pressed in terms of strongly intensive quantities from the Ar+Sc energy
scan will be presented. These ﬂuctuations are expected to be sensitive to
the existence of a critical point. The results are compared with results from
the p+p and Be+Be energy scan as well as with NA49 measurements.

1. Introduction

The NA61/SHINE experiment [1] is a multi-purpose ﬁxed target exper-
iment at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) of the European Organiza-
tion for Nuclear Research (CERN). The strong interaction programme of
NA61/SHINE consists of studies of the onset of deconﬁnement (OD) [2]
in nucleus-nucleus collisions and search for the critical point (CP) [3] of
strongly interacting matter.

NA61/SHINE performes measurements of hadron production in colli-
sions of protons and various nuclei (p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb)
at a range of beam momenta (13A - 158A GeV/c). It is expected that there
will be a non-monotonic dependence of ﬂuctuations of a number of observ-
ables in this scan due to the phase transition of strongly interacting matter

and the possible existence of the CP [4]. Some hints of this enhancement
were already observed by the NA49 experiment [5].

where (cid:104)· · ·(cid:105) stands for averaging over all events and ω[X] is the scaled
variance of any quantity X deﬁned as ((cid:104)X 2(cid:105) − (cid:104)X(cid:105)2)/(cid:104)X(cid:105).
In case of
joint transverse momentum PT and multiplicity N ﬂuctuations we deﬁne:
A = PT = (cid:80)N

i=1 pTi, B = N , C∆ = CΣ = (cid:104)N (cid:105)ω[pT ].

The advantage of strongly intensive quantities is that in the models of in-
dependent sources [8] and in the models of independent particle production
the contribution from volume ﬂuctuations is eliminated, allowing us to probe
the CP signals. Moreover, in the models of independent particle production
∆[PT , N ] = Σ[PT , N ] = 1. In recent measurements of NA61/SHINE [9] no
anomaly attributable to the CP was observed neither in p+p nor in forward
energy selected Be+Be collisions.

3. Results

The analysis was preformed for inelastic p+p interactions at 20, 30, 40,
80 and 158 GeV/c beam momenta, as well as Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions
at 19, 30, 40, 75 and 150A GeV/c selected for the smallest 5% of forward
energies. Selection of the most central events by the forward energy was
done using information from the NA61/SHINE forward calorimeter
the
Particle Spectator Detector (PSD) [10].

π < ybeam, where y∗

In contrast to the previous measurements [9], the analysis was restricted
to the interval 0 < y∗
π is the particle rapidity in the
c.m.s. under pion mass assumption. The lower cut is motivated by poor az-
imuthal angle acceptance and stronger electron contamination at backward
rapidities. The upper cut is used to reduce eﬀects of diﬀractive collisions.
Transverse momenta of all charged particles were restricted to 0 < pT < 1.5
GeV/c.

The results for p+p and Be+Be collisions were corrected for contribu-
tions from non-target interactions. For this purpose NA61/SHINE acquired

data with both target inserted and removed. The contribution from non-
target interactions was subtracted in the analysis. For Ar+Sc collisions
these corrections were estimated to be negligible. The results were also
corrected for detector ineﬃciencies and trigger biases by multidimensional
corrections of the moments in p+p and Be+Be collisions and by separate
moment corrections for Ar+Sc collisions.

The statistical uncertainties were estimated using the sub-sample method
[9], and the systematic uncertainties were estimated to be smaller than 10%
for ∆[PT , N ] and Σ[PT , N ]. Further analysis of the systematic uncerainties
will follow.

3.1. Energy and system size dependence of ∆[PT , N ] and Σ[PT , N ]

Figures 1 and 2 show the energy dependence of ∆[PT , N ] and Σ[PT , N ]
for p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions for all charged, positively charged
and negatively charged hadrons. The same results are presented in two-
dimensional plots as unction of
sN N and mean number of wounded nucle-
ons (cid:104)W (cid:105) (from Ref. [12]) in Figs. 3 and 4. No dip-like or hill-like structures
that could be related to the critical point of strongly interacting matter [13]
are observed in these results.

the ﬁrst estimate of the systematic uncertainties for Ar+Sc collisions, sug-
gesting that limitation of acceptance makes ﬂuctuation observables go to a
common limit.
