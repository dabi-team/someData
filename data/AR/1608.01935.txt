X-ray outﬂows of active galactic nuclei warm
absorbers: A 900 ks Chandra simulated
spectrum

J.M Ramírez-Velasquez and Javier García

Abstract We report on the performance of the statistical, X-ray absorption lines
identiﬁcation procedure xline-id. As illustration, it is used to estimate the time av-
eraged gas density nH(r) of a representative AGN’s warm absorber (T ≈ 105 K)
X-ray simulated spectrum. The method relies on three key ingredients: (1) a well
established emission continuum level; (2) a robust grid of photoionization models
spanning several orders of magnitude in gas density (nH), plasma column density
(NH), and in ionization states; (3) theoretical curves of growth for a large set of
atomic lines. By comparing theoretical and observed equivalent widths of a large
set of lines, spanning highly ionized charge states from O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, and
the Fe L-shell and K-shell, we are able to infer the location of the X-ray warm
absorber.

1 Introduction

In active galactic nuclei (AGNs), photoionization has been recognized as the main
mechanism for the formation of Ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray lines (Bahcall and Kozlovsky
(1969)). If the photo-ionized plasma reaches a stable state for their ion populations,
they are said to be in photo-ionization equilibrium (PIE). Under the assumption of
PIE, one of the principal parameters describing the physical condition of the plasma
is the ionization parameter ξ:

where L is the ionizing luminosity of the primary source, nH(r) is the gas density,
and r is the distance from the ionizing source to the interacting shell/slab of plasma.
Therefore, spectral ﬁtting to the observational data in the X-ray band of a given
source combined with a measurement of its luminosity L provide constrains on the
degenerated quantity nH(r)r2. Moreover, in order to have an estimate of the spatial
location of the gas absorbing/emitting photons from the primary underlying source,
an independent determination of the gas density nH(r) is required.

Curve of growth (COG) (Spitzer (1998)) is a useful tool to gather information
from astrophysical spectra, like ion column density (Nion) using the strength of
absorption lines. However, the technique is full of exact requirements and limita-
tions. In order for a line to be used as COG diagnostic tool, ﬁrstly (1) a well de-
ﬁned continuum level has to be known prior any construction of the COG. Secondly
(2) the synthetic COGs, are usually compare with real measurements of equivalent
widths (EWs) of lines. Third (3) the chosen lines must be not saturated respect to
the variable we wish to contrast to. Furthermore (4), a reliable identiﬁcation proce-
dure must be built on the grounds of a well constructed photoionization modelling
(Kallman and Bautista (2001)) which in turn needs a well established set of atomic
data. For instance, Badnell (2006) pointed out about the inappropriate use of some
dielectronic recombination (DR) rates, which are later discussed by Kallman (2010)
in the context of photoionization modelling and the correct use of atomic data (now
implemented in the latest version of xstar) (Bautista and Kallman (2001)).

Following a series of papers related with the computations of K lines of Fe

(Palmeri et al. (2002, 2003a)), and K-shell photoabsorption of O ions (Ramírez and Bautista
(2002); García et al. (2005, 2011) atomic data (energies, cross sections, lifetimes),
Palmeri et al. (2008)) discuss in detail the reliability and accuracy of some sets of
these data (medium-Z elements), currently observed in the X-ray spectrum of active
galactic nuclei (AGNs, e.g., NGC 3783 Kaspi et al. (2002); Ramírez et al. (2005);
Ramírez (2011), MR 2251−178 Ramírez et al. (2008), APM 08279+5255 Ramírez
(2008), Ark 564 Ramírez (2013)), in the form of K-absorption lines of H- and He-
like Ne,Mg,Si,S, possibly Ar and Ca, and also from lower and medium ionization
stages of Si and S (e.g., for MCG-6-30-15 and IRAS 13349+2438) (Holczer et al.
(2007)), with the aim of improving the atomic database of the xstar modelling code.
We report on the accuracy of the statistical method, xline-id which allows us to
extract time averaged gas density nH of interacting material surrounding UV+X-
rays sources, from EW measurements and detection of unsaturated absorption lines
respect nH.

The paper is organized as follows: in the ﬁrst section, the set of data used, next
the details of the method, and ﬁnally we delineate the results of the distribution of
Doppler velocities found, and compute gas densities. We also discuss the results and
conclude. Throughout this paper, we use a cosmology with H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1,
ΩM = 0.3 and Ωλ = 0.7.

The set of data and the emission continuum level

One of the main problems in the identiﬁcation of narrow spectral features in X-ray
sources, is the impossibility of contrasting the ﬁnal atomic identiﬁcation (ID) of
a feature with an input feature, once it has passed through all the instrumentation
(eﬀective areas, re-distribution matrix, etc). This is why we aim at assessing this
problem, generating a spectrum, over which we have absolute control of every single
feature (absorption lines and edges). For that purpose we have created an artiﬁcial
ﬁrst dispersion order ±1 HETG+MEG 900 ks (HETGS with medium energy grating
[MEG]), where we know exactly where every feature is located, and described in
more detail as follows.

We begin by building a physical model (pow)*wabs1*wabs2 constituted by an
UV+X-rays source, redshifted by z = 0.00976, emitting a powerlaw (pow), mod-
iﬁed by two constant-density (log[nH] = 12 [cm−3]) absorbers (wabs1, with ion-
ization parameter log ξ = 2.08 [erg cm s−1], column densities NH = 1022 cm−2,
and wabs2, with ionization parameter log ξ = 1.15 [erg cm s−1], column densities
NH = 1021 cm−2) 1. We call this model A. We then use xspec 12 to generate a 900
ks MEG spectrum, using appropriate +1 and -1 dispersion orders of MEG eﬀec-
tive areas and 1st order response matrix (see science threads in the ciao main page,
http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/).

Table 1 gives the physical parameters of model A to produce one of the spectra
we use in the analysis. Figures (1-2) show: the simulated ±1 MEG spectrum, (points
with error bars); how wabs1 and wabs2 (solid red line) modify the Spectral Energy
Distribution (SED)2 pow.

In order to analyze an X-ray spectrum more similar to a real observation (Pérez and Ramírez

(2014)), we introduce an outﬂow velocity to each absorber, zout−wabs1 = 0.00876
(300 km s−1) for wabs1, and zout−wabs2 = 0.00836 (420 km s−1) to wabs2.

Finally, one additional complication is introduced in model B. We add absorption
due to interstellar medium (ism), ism*(pow)*wabs1*wabs2, so we can study the
eﬀect of measuring equivalent widths, with and without consider the unabsorbed
continuum emission. Table 2 give parameters for model B. Each case will be care-
fully analyzed in the next sections.

The xline-id method: General Picture

Our goal is to compare measured line equivalent widths (EWs) with synthetic curves
generated as functions of the main physical parameters of the system: column den-
sity in the line of sight (NH), (log of) ionization parameter (log ξ), and gas density
(nH).

The ﬁrst (1) step to achieve this is to generate a grid of photoionization models
(as in AGNs, photoionization is the dominant mechanism for production of spectral
lines). Secondly (2), we deﬁne the line proﬁle and compute the integrals involved
in the EWs of the lines of interest (a list of detected features is required as input for
xline-id). This is a critical step, since none of the main photoionization codes (e.g.,
cloudy, xstar), compute this quantity (by default) for the thousands of lines usually
included in the run of the grids, mainly for computational eﬃciency. The third (3)
step is to compare measured EWs with theoretical EWs in order to draw out the
parameters of interest.

Models: The grid

Here we describe the building of the grid of models. We use the photoioniza-
tion code xstar3 v 2.2 with the most up-to-date atomic database v 2.2.1bn20
(Bautista and Kallman (2001)).

Ramírez-Velasquez and García

The code includes all the relevant atomic processes, including inner shell pro-
cesses (Palmeri et al. (2003a,b)). It computes the emissivities and optical depths of
the most prominent X-ray and UV lines identiﬁed in AGN spectra. Our models
are based on spherical slabs illuminated by a point-like X-ray continuum source.
The input parameters are the source spectrum, the gas composition, the gas density
nH, the column density in the line of sight NH and the ionization parameter ξ. The
source spectrum is described by the spectral luminosity Lǫ = Lion fǫ , where Lion is
fǫdǫ = 1. The spectral
the integrated luminosity from 1 to 1000 Ryd, and
function fǫ is taken to be a powerlaw ∼ ǫα with α = −1 (photon index Γx = 2). The
gas consists of the following elements, H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca
and Fe. We use the abundances of Grevesse et al. (1996) in all our models (and the
term solar for these abundances). We adopt a turbulent velocity of 200 km s−1. The
total ionizing luminosity used is Lion = 2.5 × 1044 erg s−1.

1000 Ryd

R

We have taken two representative ionization parameters: log ξ = 2.08 [erg cm
s−1], and log ξ = 1.15 [erg cm s−1]. We call them medium ionization plasma (MIP,
represented by wabs1) and low ionization plasma (LIP, represented by wabs2), re-
spectively. Finally due to our interest in testing the sensitivity of the line strengths
with the gas density, we run nH = 10[5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18] cm−3, and NH =[1,0.1]×1022
cm−2, for each of the two ionization states, resulting in 28 points in the grid, making
it a modest resolution density-COG grid for warm absorber in AGNs.

trunk-1: The identiﬁcation list model

We have developed a simple algorithm to identify observed absorption spectral fea-
tures. The identiﬁcation is performed by comparing both the line wavelength and
optical depth with those computed theoretically in our grid of models. For each
model we choose the 500 strongest features, which results in a total of 14,000 theo-
retical absorption lines (500 × 14nH × 2NH). We shall refer to this as our identiﬁca-
tion list. The simplest way to identify an observed line is to compare its measured
wavelength with the theoretical values. However, one must also allow for the pos-
sibility of wavelength shifts due to velocity components in the absorbing material.
Thus, starting with the best-ﬁt for the line centroid λ0 of a given observed line,
we search for theoretical lines within a ±∆λ0 identiﬁcation window (IW) around
λ0. This allows for the identiﬁcation of blue or redshifted lines. If more than one
theoretical line is present in the identiﬁcation window, we choose the line with the
largest optical depth at the core (τ0).

A second observed feature can be found close enough such that its identiﬁcation
window cover a similar range, including the same strong lines. If the next observed
feature is identiﬁed by the same theoretical line as in the feature just before, we do
not allow for repetition but rather choose the second strongest line in the identiﬁca-
tion window. This allows for the detection of duplets. Nevertheless, this constrain
is only applied to two consecutive lines. Thus, if a third consecutive observed line
(i.e. two features next) is identify with the same strongest theoretical lines as the

X-ray outﬂows of AGNs

ﬁrst, this one is assigned again. This allows the detection of more than one veloc-
ity component. The result is an identiﬁcation list based on the strongest predicted
absorption line, ±∆λ0 Å around a feature detected at λ0 Å, truncated only once for
repetition if two features are too close. We call this identiﬁcation list model trunk-1.
Similar studies have been carried out in the past where measured absorption fea-
tures are compared with a theoretical features in a given identiﬁcation list (e.g.,
Krongold et al. (2003); Netzer et al. (2003)). However, these studies present two
important limitations: the identiﬁcation list employed typically contain a relatively
small number of theoretical features (e.g., ∼ 50), and their identiﬁcation is based
on comparing the wavelength position of the observed feature with those calculated
theoretically using undeﬁned identiﬁcation window (how much is allowed for an
observed feature to be compared with theory, e.g., 0.1 Å, is too large). The latter
restriction is particularly important because the larger the identiﬁcation window be-
comes, the more are the chances of an incorrect identiﬁcation. To demonstrate the
eﬃcacy of our methodology, we have applied the trunk-1 algorithm to the synthetic
spectra produced with Model A, i.e., the model consisting of two warm absorbers
(Table 1).

Because we know exactly which lines are contained in the synthetic spectra, we
can then assess how well trunk-1 identify the observed lines. Figure 3 shows the
level of matching in percent achieved by trunk-1. The upper panel in Figure 3 shows
the level of matching achieved when the identiﬁcation is performed solely based on
the line position. A good matching is only possible when the identiﬁcation window
is set to the smallest value (∆λ0 = 10−4 Å). For wider windows the quality of the
identiﬁcation becomes rapidly poor. A much better performance is achieved when,
in addition to line positions, line strengths are also compared with the theoretical
predictions. This agreement is shown in the lower panel of Figure 3, where is clear
that the full trunk-1 method is capable to correctly identify no less of 90% of the
lines, even for the largest identiﬁcation window considered (∆λ0 = 0.2 Å).

The synthetic spectra discussed above contains 239 absorption lines produced
with the MIP (wabs 1), and 115 lines produced with the LIP (wabs 2). Although the
identiﬁcation is somewhat better for the lines produced in the absorption compo-
nent with the smaller redshift (wabs 1), these results indicate that our algorithm can
be successfully implemented to real X-ray observations where complex mixture of
absorption components can be present. Figure 5 shows the 11–12 Å band of the syn-
thetic spectra, where the known absorption features and those identiﬁed by trunk-1
are indicated.

Our method correctly identiﬁes 100% of the lines in this band, which we have
tested for diﬀerent widths of the identiﬁcation window. A similar analysis is per-
formed using a synthetic spectra based on Model B (Table 2), where on top of the
two warm absorber components, a third component due to galactic absorption is
included (ism). This latter component only includes the continuum (bound-free)
photoelectric absorption, thus while it modiﬁes the model continuum it does not
introduces any additional absorption features.

In order to illustrate the virtues and caveats of the method we show in Figure 4,
six (6) possible cases which are easily solved by it. In panel (a) we have the simplest

possible case. One observed feature λ(O)1, has an IW ∆λ0, and only the theoretical
line λ(T )1 is within the IW. Then λ(O)1 is easily identiﬁed as λ(T )1.

In panel (b), theoretical lines λ(T )1 and λ(T )2 are within ∆λ0. In this case we
simply take the one with the largest optical depth. If we assign τ1 to λ(T )1 and τ2 to
λ(T )2 with τ1 > τ2, then λ(O)1 is simply identiﬁed as λ(T )1.

In panel (c) we now have a second observed feature λ(O)2. Assuming λ(O)1
was already identiﬁed as λ(T )1 and ∆λ0−2 does not contain another theoretical line,
λ(O)2 will be marked as unknown. Although this is a rare case, it can be mentioned
as a caveat of the algorithm (which also happens with regular ID methods).

In panel (d) a second theoretical line λ(T )2 is now in the list of candidates for
λ(O)2. Assuming λ(O)1 was already identiﬁed as λ(T )1, the trunk-1 will force to
λ(O)2 to be identiﬁed as λ(T )2 and not as λ(T )1, missing the “unlikely" possibil-
ity of λ(O)2 being a second velocity-component of λ(O)1, and by some unknown
mechanism λ(T )2 was remove from our line-of-sight. Although rare, this also has to
be mentioned as a caveat of the method.

In panel (e), we allow the possibility of λ(O)1 to have a second velocity-
component, if λ(O)1 was already identiﬁed as λ(T )1, and λ(O)2 as λ(T )2, then λ(O)3
will be identiﬁed as λ(T )1.

And ﬁnally in panel (f), there will be two duplets velocity-components with

λ(O)1 and λ(O)3 identiﬁed as λ(T )1, and λ(O)2 and λ(O)4 identiﬁed as λ(T )2.

Although not complete, the list of possible cases cover the situations given in
the present work. More cases and/or possibilities can be added to the algorithm
in the future, but the results given by Figure 3 (bottom panel), show the method’s
performance is at the level of ≈ 90 %.

In summary we list the limitations of the method:

1. From the beginning, if the photoionization components (e.g., wabs1 and/or
wabs2) are not globally ﬁtting the spectrum, the ID process will be dubious.
2. The method expects a list of detected features. If as part of a blend, only one
feature is given, the method will ID it as the strongest one, regardless the micro-
physics of the blend.

3. The method will not identify a case where the physics changes the ratio λ(T )1/λ(T )2 >

1 to < 1 (e.g., case b of Figure 4).

4. Naturally, if the continuum is not well established in the building of the physical
model, at the beginning of the process, the absolute measurement of EWs will be
wrong (though the comparison between them will be good since they all use the
same continuum).

5. The algorithm does not allow the ID of two-velocity component of a feature
under the conﬁguration given by case c) of Figure 4. In all those cases visual and
manual inspections are required.

Line Proﬁle and EWs

Our procedure receive a list of lines (previously produced in the ID step) and applies
the following treads: Each transition produces an absorption optical depth computed
with:

τλ = τ0φλ,

(2)

πe2
the optical depth at the core of the line is τ0 =
mc flu, where
∆R = NH/nH is the thickness of the slab, N0
ion is the column density of the ion at
the line core (i.e., λ = λ0), m is the electron mass, e is the electron charge, c is the
speed of light, and flu is the oscillator strength of the transition. The line proﬁle φλ,

is assumed to be a Voigt proﬁle (Rybicki and Lightman (1979)). The Doppler broad-
ening parameter v2
therm, is the combination of microturbulent (vturb) and
thermal broadening (vtherm). The last one is computed with vtherm =
, where
kB is the Bolztmann constant, µmH is the average mass per particle; µ ≃ 0.6 for
fully ionized solar-metallicity gas. The temperature T is taken from our xstar cal-
culations. The microturbulent velocity vturb is set to 200 km s−1. Then, we build
absorption spectrum for each line (Fλ around each feature) and compute EWs:

One important problem we are able to address here, is the diﬀerence of mea-
suring absorption line EWs taking into account all the relevant atomic physics, i.e.,
bound-bound and bound-free transitions, which extend from the SED, in contrast
with measurements of EWs made using as the continuum the absorbed SED. We
call the ﬁrst type unabsorbed EWs and the second one absorbed EWs. Figure 6,
depicts this problem in a visual manner.

Fig. 6 Simulated spectrum (11-12 Å) showing the input “full-list" given to the procedure trunk-1
for ism+wabs1+wabs2, and the output identiﬁcation list, using ∆λ = 10−4 Å (vertical black dashed
lines for wabs1, and vertical blue dashed lines for wabs2). The absorption lines are enumerated in
increasing order from 1 to 13.

For instance in a model where a single absorber is present (wabs1), we ﬁnd dif-
ference between the level of SED (red dashed line in Figures), and the level of the
absorbed SED (gray dashed line), which is the result of the SED’s radiation passing
through wabs1. It is clear that measuring EWs using these two diﬀerent continuum
levels will give diﬀerent results.

Likewise applied to a real observation, the method identiﬁes and present results
from H- and He-like ions falling in the X-rays regime, and diﬀerences among 6 %

at λ ≈ 20 Å in lines like Lyα and Lyβ of OVIII, to 24 % at λ ≈ 10 Å in lines like
MgXI and L-shell of FeXVI-FeXIX, are attributable to the chosen continuum level.
The situation becomes more dramatic as the complexity in absorption increases
for model A and model B. We quantify how important this continuum level problem
results, where ISM is taking into account. Up to 80 % diﬀerences, in both absorbers
wabs1 and wabs2, of EW measurements are observed, and it serves as benchmark
for comparison of EWs measured using the free-line region (FLR) technique, which
make use of absorbed SED as continuum level, as for instance in Kaspi et al. (2002),
for measuring line properties of NGC 3783 (see their Table 1).

Results: Deducing distance from the supermassive black hole

In this section we apply our method to the X-ray 900 ks spectrum, introduced in the
ﬁrst section.

Measured vs Theoretical EWs

Theoretical curves of the Ratio= EWmeas
(measured EW to theoretical EW) vs nH, for
EWtheo
each of the identiﬁed features included in the simulation, are compared for wabs1
and wabs2. In Figure 7 (bottom panel) we plot all the Ratios produced through
identiﬁcation of lines (239) using the trunk-1 model and the absorber wabs1 (log ξ =
2.08, NH = 1022 cm−2, nH = 1012 cm−3). A wavelength-color map has been placed
at the right side, so one can read which lines are causing the deviations from 1,
that is obtained when EWmeas = EWtheo. It is natural from this plot to infer what
is the spectrum that matches better the observation, i.e., the one with the smaller
standard deviation (SD, top axis on the plot) from the mean equal to 1. The same
type of graphics has been plotted in Figure 8 for wabs2 (log ξ = 1.15, NH = 1021
cm−2, nH = 1012 cm−3), where again we reach the conclusion that the best-ﬁt nH is
the one with smallest SD for Ratio, with mean 1. An analysis of these results will
be given in the next section.

COG analysis

In order for a line to be used as density diagnostic, it must be not saturated, and
its ratio with measured EWs sensitive respect to nH. In Figure 8 we present the
ratio of measured to theoretical EWs for each of the feature identiﬁed and included
in building of the spectrum, given by the LIP, with IW, ∆λ = 10−4 Å. This plot
infers that the plasma gas density reproducing best the observation is nH = 1012
cm−3, where SD=0.0. Fitting procedures allow us to set limits on SD in order to

achieve conﬁdence level in therms of χ2. SD of 0.12-0.15 produce changes > 90
% conﬁdence level on measurements of nH. We are able to infer the gas density of
the spectrum to be nH = (2.4 × 1010, 1.2 × 1013) cm−3, for the LIP component of the
absorbing complex in model B.

The COG ratio shown by the MIP is an excellent case of highly sensitive curve
with nH (see Figure 7). The envolvent (irregular gray polygon) makes a strong con-
strain of the gas density to be nH ≈ 1012 cm−3. Again limits on the measurements
using SD=0.15-0.17 (χ2 > 2.79) reports nH = (1.9 × 1010, 3.1 × 1012) cm−3, for the
MIP component of model B.

We checked for the robustness of these measurements with the building of a 2D
contours, produced by computing a grid of photoionization models for wabs1 (MIP)

and wabs2 (LIP), varying log(nH) = 5 − 18 [cm−3], with one point per decade. The
result is plotted at the top panel of Figure 7 (for wabs1). From the best-ﬁt nH ≈
1012 cm−3, χ2 ≈ 4845 using 4604 PHA bins (and two free parameters), we compute
contour level of conﬁdences 63 %, 90 % and 95 % for nH and the normalization
parameter of the powerlaw.

We remark here, that in an independent way, we are obtaining results that are in
agreement with the measurements given by our own method. In the bottom panel we
compare these xspec measurements, i.e., single parameter 90 % conﬁdence level on
nH (vertical dot-dashed line), against the xline-ID results. The obvious advantage
of our method, is that we can track each of the absorption line which is contributing
to the COG ratio density diagnostic, overcoming problems like several χ2−minima,

The second main result of the present analysis can be drawn from Figure 9. There

(∆λ Å around the feature), is ﬂagged as unknown and is not taken into account in
the probability distribution function (p.d.f) analysis. As we may observe from Fig. 9,
one of the main components have peaks at vout ≈ 300 (wabs1) and 420 (wabs2) km
s−1, conﬁrming the expected result, as this is what we introduce as outﬂow velocity
in our simulated data (see Table 2).

A closer examination also reveals densities diﬀerent from zero for higher velocity
outﬂows, for instance exhibits by the LIP Si IX λ6.938 Å outﬂowing at vout ≃ 3600
km s−1, and Si VIII λ7.005 Å with vout ≃ 3200 km s−1, which are clearly wrong iden-
tiﬁcations, consequence of the identiﬁcation window scheme (for the two plasma,
solid line has ∆λ = 10−4 Å, dashed line with ∆λ = 0.1 Å, and dotted line with
∆λ = 0.2 Å). However we see that the density function of these velocities are very
small compared with the components made by right identiﬁcation.

2 Discussion & Conclusions

In this paper we show how important is to correctly deﬁne the level of continuum
for EW measurements, which could diﬀer up to ∼ 80 %, including or not interstellar
absorption. We also show that xline-id is better than 90% in the identiﬁcation of
absorption lines, where more than one absorber is present.

Once we have inferred the gas density from the spectral lines, we can take equa-
tion (1) and compute r from it. What is deduced, using the relation nH ∝ r−2, and Fig-
ure 10, is a suggestion of the MIP located at distances of rMIP ≃ (0.18 − 1.80) lt-days
(log r ≃ 14.7 − 15.7 [cm]), and the LIP located at distances of rLIP ≃ (0.51 − 5.13)
lt-days (log r ≃ 15.1 − 16.1 [cm]). The global picture that emerges from this is that
