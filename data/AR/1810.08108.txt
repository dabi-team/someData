ABSTRACT

Context. Exoplanets have now been proven to be very common. The number of its detections continues to grow following the
development of better instruments and missions. One key step for the understanding of these worlds is their characterization, which
mostly depend on their host stars.
Aims. We perform a signiﬁcant update of the Stars With ExoplanETs CATalog (SWEET-Cat), a unique compilation of precise stellar
parameters for planet-host stars provided for the exoplanet community.
Methods. We made use of high-resolution spectra for planet-host stars, either observed by our team or found in several public archives.
The new spectroscopic parameters were derived for the spectra following the same homogeneous process (ARES+MOOG). The host
star parameters were then merged together with the planet properties listed in exoplanet.eu to perform simple data analysis.
Results. We present new spectroscopic homogeneous parameters for 106 planet-host stars. Sixty-three planet hosts are also reviewed
with new parameters. We also show that there is a good agreement between stellar parameters derived for the same star but using
spectra obtained from diﬀerent spectrographs. The planet-metallicity correlation is reviewed showing that the metallicity distribution
of stars hosting low-mass planets (below 30 M⊕) is indistinguishable from that from the solar neighborhood sample in terms of
metallicity distribution.

1. Introduction

The ﬁrst extrasolar planets around solar-type stars to be discov-
ered, hot jupiters, have completely changed our understanding of
planet formation and evolution based on the solar system alone
(e.g., Mayor & Queloz 1995). The surprises were far from over
and in recent years, with the detection of smaller and lower mass
planets, and our theoretical view continues to be shaped by the
observational evidence. Today ∼ 3800 extrasolar planets have
been discovered orbiting ∼ 2800 solar-type stars (exoplanet.eu
Schneider et al. 2011). The higher numbers of discoveries al-

lows us to perform better statistical studies on the diﬀerent types
of planetary systems.

Although today we are convinced that extrasolar planets are
present around almost every (dwarf or main sequence) star (e.g.,
Mayor et al. 2011), the ﬁrst observational evidence, based on the
ﬁrst massive planets detections, showed that planets were more
frequently orbiting metal-rich stars (e.g., Santos et al. 2004;
Valenti & Fischer 2005). Soon after, it was reported that the
metallicity correlation was not clear for the ﬁrst detections of
lower mass and small planets (e.g., Sousa et al. 2008; Ghezzi
et al. 2010; Schlaufman & Laughlin 2011; Buchhave et al. 2012;
Wang & Fischer 2015; Buchhave & Latham 2015). Other ob-
servational evidence has been reported involving the host stel-
lar properties and the properties of planets. Correlations such
as the planetary radius versus metallicity (e.g., Buchhave et al.
2014; Schlaufman 2015), planet-period versus metallicity, or ec-
centricity versus metallicity (e.g., Beaugé & Nesvorný 2013;
Adibekyan et al. 2013; Dawson et al. 2015; Mulders et al. 2016;
Wilson et al. 2018), all show interesting evidence that is impor-
tant for the understanding of planet formation. It is therefore cru-

cial not only to increase the number of discoveries but also to
characterize planetary systems precisely since they play a fun-
damental role in the interpretation of these results.

Precise and accurate fundamental planetary parameters
(mass, radius, and mean density) are needed to distinguish be-
tween solid rocky, water rich, or otherwise gas dominated plan-
ets. To achieve this we need a precision of planetary mass up to
10% and a radius up to 5% (or even 2% for further bulk charac-
terization; e.g., Wagner et al. 2011; Bean et al. 2011). The deriva-
tion and precision of the planetary properties depends consider-
ably on the deduced parameters of the stellar host (e.g., Bouchy
et al. 2004; Torres et al. 2012; Mortier et al. 2013b; Sousa et al.
2015b). Interestingly, it has been shown that the quality of the
spectroscopic and photometric observations aﬀects the proper-
ties of the planets more signiﬁcantly than the model-dependent
systematics, such as using diﬀerent stellar evolution models for
the determination of stellar mass and radius (e.g., Southworth
2009). It is therefore extremely important to use high-quality
data to reﬁne the values for these stellar properties in order to ob-
tain more precise and accurate stellar masses and radii and thus
more precise and accurate planetary masses and radii. Further-
more, to minimize global statistical errors, a uniform analysis is
required (see, e.g., Torres et al. 2012) to guarantee homogeneity
of the results. Using diﬀerent methods to derive stellar properties
leads to discrepancies in the results which, in turn, deteriorates
the signiﬁcance of the statistical analyses.

For this reason a great eﬀort has been made in the creation
and continuous update of the currently largest homogeneous cat-
alog of stellar parameters for planet hosts (SWEET-Cat1) ﬁrst
presented in Santos et al. (2013), and then updated with new pa-
rameters for a signiﬁcant number of planet hosts in Sousa et al.
(2015b) and in Andreasen et al. (2017). In this work we con-
tinue the series of SWEET-Cat papers using our uniform method,
which has been tested and improved upon extensively. We col-
lected spectra from diﬀerent spectrographs to derive new homo-
geneous stellar parameters for 106 planet hosts. We then use the
updated catalog to review the metallicity correlations and make
these parameters available for the community; these new values
can be used for further statistical studies in the quest for clues
for the formation and evolution of the planets.

The work is divided into the following sections: Section 2
describes the spectroscopic data compilation for SWEET-Cat,
together with some details on spectra characteristics that our
team has compiled to date. Section 3 shows results for the new
spectroscopic stellar parameters derived as well as a compari-
son with literature values. In addition we show that the homog-
enization of our method is valid with the use of many diﬀerent
high-resolution spectrographs. Section 4 presents some up-to-
date metallicity correlations relevant for planet formation. We
conclude in Section 5 with a summary of the work presented.

2. Spectroscopic data

In this section we describe the spectroscopic data used to derive
stellar parameters in recent years. Some of this data were already
relatively old (more than ten years), obtained from diﬀerent
spectrographs, and were already used in previous works. These
were collected from observations with diverse scientiﬁc goals,
mostly from radial-velocity (RV) planet surveys (e.g., HARPS),
and other data were obtained speciﬁcally for planet-host spectro-
scopic stellar characterization (e.g., FEROS and UVES). To bet-
ter describe all sources of the diﬀerent spectroscopic data used

today for SWEET-Cat, we divided the discussion into the fol-
lowing items: legacy data, recent observations, and public data
from spectroscopic archives.

2.1. Compiling legacy spectroscopic data

One of the goals of this work was to compile all the spectra that
our team has used in the past works which provides parame-
ters for SWEET-Cat. The list of spectrographs used in SWEET-
Cat is already relatively large and can be seen in Table 1. We
compiled all the spectra from our previous works in the liter-
ature to derive the stellar parameters. These include Ammler-
von Eiﬀ et al. (2009); Andreasen et al. (2017); Boisse et al.
(2010, 2012); Bonomo et al. (2012); Damasso et al. (2015); Del-
gado Mena et al. (2014); Díaz et al. (2012, 2016); Gillon et al.
(2007); Gómez Maqueo Chew et al. (2013); Hébrard et al. (2010,
2016); Lillo-Box et al. (2016); Melo et al. (2007); Montalto et al.
(2012); Mortier et al. (2013a,b); Moutou et al. (2006, 2011,
2014, 2015); Neves et al. (2013, 2014); Osborn et al. (2017);
Pont et al. (2008); Rey et al. (2017); Sahlmann et al. (2011);
Santerne et al. (2014, 2016); Santos et al. (2004, 2005, 2006,
2008, 2013); Ségransan et al. (2010); Sousa et al. (2006, 2008,
2011a,b, 2015b); Tamuz et al. (2008); Tsantaki et al. (2013,
2014); Udalski et al. (2008); Wilson et al. (2016); da Silva et al.
(2007).

The original data formats depend on several factors such as
the instrument used or the pipeline used to process the data. Most
of the spectra are stored in standard Flexible Image Transport
System (FITS) ﬁles, but some were stored in text format. In or-
der to homogenize all the data we made sure that all the individ-
ual spectra were stored in a standard 1D ﬁt format, easy to read
by standard routines and in particular by the Automatic Routine
for line Equivalent widths in stellar Spectra (ARES; see Sousa
et al. 2007, 2015a), which requires speciﬁc FITS header key-
words (e.g., CDELT1 and CRVAL1).

It is not our goal here to completely describe all the details of
this technical step, but rather to provide a short description. Most
of the spectra were already reduced and stored in this format. For
the text ﬁles, the transformation is trivial, unless the wavelength
spacing is not constant. In these cases we interpolated the spec-
tra to derive an evenly spaced wavelength coverage, which is
a requirement for the adopted FITS format. The 2D echelle re-
duced spectra actually needed more caution for the correct trans-
formation into the standard 1D spectra. For the blaze-corrected
and normalized 2D spectrum, the transformation is trivial and
a simple merging of the orders was performed; we took special
caution when the orders overlapped in wavelength. For these we
used the scombine routine in Image Reduction and Analysis Fa-
cility (IRAF) that allow us to combine diﬀerent orders into a
1D spectrum. For rather old spectra (e.g., SARG and some old
FIES observations) the 2D spectra are still contaminated with
the blaze function. To make the situation more complex, in a few
cases there were also some strange peak structures in the limits
of the orders, most likely due to reduction problems. These cre-
ates diﬃculties for an automatic merging of the orders and for
those cases we went spectra by spectra, order by order, to clean
out the peak structures in the spectra as best as possible before
the merging of the orders into a 1D spectrum.

2.2. Recent spectroscopic observations and data reduction

During recent years several of our ESO proposals have been suc-
cessfully awarded with which we obtained high-resolution spec-

Notes. Many of these spectrographs have diﬀerent conﬁgurations avail-
able for observation. We list the typical spectral range and resolution
for the observations that we collected or found in archives.

In all these proposals we took advantage of the use of Im-
age Slicer #3, which allows us to observe with poor seeing con-
ditions and still catches most of the ﬂux. Since we used a line

by line analysis in our procedures, we proposed to observe with
the smallest slit (0.3“), which gives a higher resolution for a
better spectroscopic analysis. The typical spectra conﬁguration
used for UVES is RED580, which covers the optical spectrum
in the interval 476-684nm; this allows us to observe many lines
of diﬀerent elements. The spectra collected in these proposals
are supposed to achieve a S/N of 300 for the stars brighter than
V=10 and S/N of 150 for the faintest stars. For the brightest stars
single exposures are enough to reach the requested S/N. For the
fainter stars we choose to divide the requested exposure times in
chunks of a maximum of 1800 seconds of exposure. With this
observational strategy, we avoid the overpopulation of cosmic
rays, which becomes more diﬃcult to correct for large exposure
times.

The data reduction of these observations were carried out
using the UVES Pipeline in Reﬂex (Freudling et al. 2013) pro-
vided by ESO following the standard recipes and suggestions
mentioned in the UVES pipeline manual to reduce UVES data
observed with the image slicer.

The combination of the spectra was then carried out using the
IRAF routine scombine, which was used to combine the REDl
and REDu spectra observations, and later this routine was used
to combine these spectra into one ﬁnal 1D spectrum.

2.3. Spectra from the public archives

Most of the pubic data that we were able to ﬁnd came from the
ESO archive2 with the help of astroquery3; more speciﬁcally we
looked for reduced data, which are also available. We looked for
relatively high resolution and good S/N (also considering pos-
sible combinations of low S/N individual spectra). We selected
the ESO instruments FEROS, HARPS, and UVES for this search
in this archive. When many spectra were available for the same
star, probably coming from RV planet search surveys, we down-
loaded a suﬃcient number of spectra to reach a S/N of about
2000. We note that these S/N values comes directly from photon
counts and the real S/N should depend on other noise sources
(e.g., background subtraction). Also, for the faint stars in the
archive, when suﬃcient spectra were available, we discarded the
very low S/N spectra for the combination. To give an idea of
the amount of data collected from ESO during this process we
made more than 100 archive requests with around 34 Gb of data
in total. Other archives were also used to search for spectra for

parameters with recent spectroscopic data. The orange triangles represent new rederived parameters with legacy spectroscopic data.

SWEET-Cat. These include current public archives containing
spectra from SOPHIE4, ESPADONS5, and FIES6.

2.4. SWEET-Cat spectroscopic data statistics

As of April 2018 we had a total of 2 631 planet-host stars (source
exoplanet.eu). We were able to gather spectra for 653 of these,
including the new sources presented in this work. The reason
for this relatively low number of stars with spectra is because
many are relatively faint stars observed by Kepler (Borucki et al.
2010). Given the faintness of the majority of these stars, it is
clear that the observation and the collection of high-quality,
high-resolution spectra is quite diﬃcult and costly. On top of
that, Kepler stars are not observable from ESO facilities, which
are our most direct source of data. When considering bright stars,
which is also fundamental for RV follow up and planetary mass
measurements (Fortier et al. 2014; Rauer et al. 2014), the per-
centage of stars with spectra and homogeneous parameters be-
comes quite high. With the work presented in this paper, consid-
ering the addition of 106 new stars with homogeneous parame-
ters, we have ∼90% and ∼80% completeness for stars with V < 9
and V < 12, respectively. Completeness represents the number
of planet hosts with homogeneous spectroscopic parameters rel-
ative to the number of stars with planets in SWEET-Cat.

Table 2 sums up some numbers relative to the planet hosts
and their spectra collected using diﬀerent instruments as well as
the number of stars with derived homogeneous parameters. We
note that we have seven planet-hosts stars with low-quality spec-
tra in the database for which we did not derive reliable parame-
ters. A histogram of the S/N for all the ﬁnal combined SWEET-
Cat spectra is also presented in the top panel of Fig. 1. The S/N
value was derived automatically using the same procedure as
used in the ARES code and considering the recommended spec-

tral regions (Sousa et al. 2015a). Most of the very high S/N spec-
tra come from the combination of several spectra observed dur-
ing RV programs. The correlation between the S/N of our spectra
with the V magnitude of the planet-host stars is also clear (see
bottom panel of Fig. 1).

The

analysis was
”ARES+MOOG“ (In this work we used ARES v2, and
MOOG2014. For more details, see Sousa 2014) both for the
new spectroscopic data and for part of the legacy data that
already had derived homogeneous parameters before 2008. The
analysis is based on the excitation and ionization balance of
iron abundance, where the absorption lines are consistently
measured with the ARES code (Sousa et al. 2007, 2015a) and
the abundances are derived in local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE) with the MOOG code (Sneden 1973) and uses a grid
of Kurucz ATLAS9 plane-parallel model atmospheres (Ku-
rucz 1993). The same methodology can also be applied with
FASMA7(Andreasen et al. 2017). The method has been applied
in our previous spectroscopic studies of planet hosts (e.g., Sousa
et al. 2008, 2011a; Mortier et al. 2013b; Sousa et al. 2015b).

The line list used here was that from Sousa et al. (2008) ex-
cept for the stars whose eﬀective temperature is below 5200 K
(Te f f < 5200K). For these stars we rederived parameters using
a more adequate line list for cooler stars, which was compiled
by Tsantaki et al. (2013). The atomic data, log gfs, were recal-
ibrated in the same way as in previous works, but in this work
we used MOOG2014. There are small changes in log gf values,
which most likely come from numerical diﬀerences from a dif-
ferent compilation of the code.

The stellar masses presented in this work were derived with
the calibration presented in Torres et al. (2010) and a correction

presented in Santos et al. (2013) was applied for the cases in
which the calibration gives values between 0.7 and 1.3 M(cid:12). The
errors for these mass values are computed as in Santos et al.
(2013), where for each case 10 000 random values of eﬀective
temperature, surface gravity, and stellar metallicity were drawn
from a Gaussian distribution. We used the uncertainties of the
spectroscopic parameters this way to estimate the distribution of
the derived mass. The error for the mass is extracted from the
standard deviation of this mass distribution for each star.

Table 4 presents

the new parameters derived with
ARES+MOOG in this work for the new spectra collected. In
this table we report the spectroscopic parameters (eﬀective tem-
perature (Teﬀ), surface gravity (log gspec), microturbulance (ξt),
and iron abundance ([Fe/H] - used as a proxy for metallicity),
the number of iron lines used in the spectroscopic analysis, and
the stellar mass. This table also presents the instrument and a
column identifying which parameters are adopted for the planet
hosts in the SWEET-Cat online table.

We note that in Sousa et al. (2008) we also used HIgh-
Precision PARallax COllecting Satellite (HIPPARCOS) paral-
laxes to derive surface gravities, and in that work we observed
some diﬀerences between the spectroscopic and trigonometric
log g. However, although the spectroscopic surface gravity is the
less constrained parameter in our analysis, the positive side is
that the other parameters (Teﬀ and [Fe/H]) are almost indepen-
dent of the log g. This means that when ﬁxing the log g to a dif-
ferent value derived with the use of parallaxes, interferometry,
and asteroseismology we do not see any signiﬁcant changes in
the other parameters. In the online table the log g values listed
are those directly derived from our spectroscopic analysis and
are not corrected for known systematics, but we suggest the user
employ the corrections discussed in Mortier et al. (2014).

There are also a few stars for which the application of an
equivalent width, such as the ARES+MOOG method, is not ap-
propriate owing to strong blends in the spectra. Some of these
stars reveal a relatively high stellar rotation ((cid:38) 10-15 Km/s) and

others are quite cool stars (Teﬀ (cid:46) 4200 K). For these stars we ap-
plied a method based on synthetic spectra, which preserves the
homogeneity; this method is described in Tsantaki et al. (2014),
in which we have shown that the parameters derived in this way
are in the same scale as the parameters derived by our Equiva-
lent Width (EW) method. The parameters for these 11 stars are
presented in Table 5. For these stars we were also able to derive
the rotational velocity (v sin(i)).

In SWEET-Cat there are a signiﬁcant amount of planet hosts,
for which the spectroscopic parameters were derived more than
ten years ago. These represent some of the ﬁrst planets discov-
ered, many of which are hot jupiters for which the spectroscopic
analysis was based on a smaller line list of iron lines (e.g., San-
tos et al. 2004). We have shown that these parameters are con-
sistent and in the same scale as those derived with the current
largest line lists (Sousa et al. 2008; Tsantaki et al. 2013). Con-
sequently, we took the opportunity to run our codes with these
line lists for the whole sample to reanalyze these stars with the
current method, which gives more statistical strength to the re-
sults. Therefore, all the spectroscopic parameters that were de-
rived with this small line list were rederived in this work. Table
6 presents the results for these planet-host stars.

Figure 2 shows the comparison between the new spectro-
scopic parameters derived in this work against the previous (in
the literature) parameters reported in SWEET-Cat mostly com-
ing from planet discovery papers. The blue circles represent new
planet hosts for which, for the ﬁrst time, we use our method
to derive parameters. The orange triangles represent the planet
hosts for which we had already reported homogeneous parame-
ters but using the small line list. As we already mentioned before
we show a very good consistency between the new and previous
homogeneous parameters. The gain is mainly related to the use
of more lines, which statistically are translated into smaller pre-
cision errors. For the completely new homogeneous data (blue
circles; 106 planet hosts) we have a general good consistency
with the literature data where the largest diﬀerences appear for

evolved stars (lower surface gravities). The lower number of
points for the microturbulence comes from the fact that many of
the spectroscopic analyses available from the literature for these
stars do not report this parameter.

3.2. Different Instruments

One of the main advantages of SWEET-Cat is the homogeniza-
tion of the spectroscopic parameters derived by our team. A pos-
sible problem that could aﬀect the homogenization would be the
use of diﬀerent instruments. Actually the use of the same instru-
ment, with the same conﬁguration, is normally considered a very
good argument to maintain the homogenization of the spectro-
scopic analysis. Moreover, there are works such as Bedell et al.
(2014) stating that the largest eﬀect is associated with the use of
diﬀerent instruments, which can go up to 0.04 dex in metallicity.
Recently we had also shown that even using the same instru-
ment, but with diﬀerent individual observations of the same star
at diﬀerent times and conditions, can reveal some non-negligible
diﬀerences in derived individual abundances (Adibekyan et al.
2016). Therefore, it is fundamental to understand how good the
homogeneity is in SWEET-Cat when using diﬀerent instruments.
To answer this relevant question we can make use of our al-
ready large compilation of spectroscopic data to test our method
against the use of diﬀerent instruments/conﬁgurations. Figure 3
shows the diﬀerences found using ARES+MOOG on spectra of
the same stars observed with diﬀerent instruments. In this plot
we merge diﬀerent instruments and, although most of the com-
parisons are made with only two spectrographs, there is a wide
variety of diﬀerent pairings to access any possible biases with
diﬀerent instruments. Also there are a few stars that were ob-
served by up to four to ﬁve diﬀerent spectrographs. Looking at
this ﬁgure and comparing the eﬀective temperatures and [Fe/H]
it is clear that the values derived are quite consistent when us-
ing diﬀerent instruments. The standard deviation of the parame-
ters relative to the averaged value, used as a reference for each
star, is quite small at 22 K for temperature and 0.01 dex for
[Fe/H]. It is true that there are some large individual diﬀerences
for temperatures that can be as high as 100 K in some cases,
but they are actually well within the errors reported for those
cases. Moreover, the average relative discrepancy from the av-
erage is consistent with or below one for all the instruments
(< T e f finst−<T e f f >
>(cid:46) 1). This simple test demonstrates that our
spectroscopic method is quite insensitive to the source of the
spectroscopic data. It is worth mentioning that most of the spec-
troscopic data compiled is generally of very good quality, both
in terms of S/N and resolution (see Figure 1 and Table 1).

σT e f finst

In what regards the selection of the parameters to be listed
in SWEET-Cat for the stars for which we have multiple instru-
ments, we selected the values with the lowest estimated errors.
We selected this instead of the average because there are cases
in which the average can still be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the
presence of lower quality spectra from other instruments. This
is of course strongly correlated with the number of lines used in
each analysis and the individual precision of each line and there-
fore the spectroscopic data with higher resolution and higher S/N
spectra are usually selected.

4. Planet-host metallicity correlations

One of the ﬁrst observational constraints for planet formation
theories was the correlation between the presence of giant plan-
ets and the higher metallicity of their host stars (e.g., Santos et al.

Article number, page 6 of 13

2004; Fischer & Valenti 2005). Of course, because of the known
observational biases from the main planet detection methods, the
ﬁrst planets found were giants and massive. Very soon the corre-
lation was tested for lower mass planets, where, despite the low
statistic signiﬁcance of the ﬁrst results, the correlation was not
observed (e.g., Udry et al. 2006; Sousa et al. 2008; Ghezzi et al.
2010; Sousa et al. 2011a; Buchhave et al. 2012). More recently,
Wang & Fischer (2015) suggested that there should be an univer-
sal planet-metallicity correlation for all planets, but this might
be related to the higher planet frequency and lower detectability
of low-mass planets (LMPs; see also Zhu et al. 2016). Once set-
tled, these observational correlations, should provide strong con-
strains for the theory of planet formation and evolution. In this
section we take advantage of our largest sample of planet-host
stars with uniform parameters to review the metallicity correla-
tion.

Figure 4 shows the metallicity distribution of planet-host
stars that have stellar parameters derived by our team in a homo-
geneous way. In the top panels we show the planet host counts by
separating the population of high-mass planets (HMP; 700 plan-
ets, with minimum masses greater than 30 M⊕) and LMPs (156
planets). The location of the gap in the planet mass distribution
presented in Mayor et al. (2011) is 30 M⊕ and we also keep this
threshold to be consistent with our previous works (e.g., Sousa
et al. 2011b). In this work, the metallicity of the host star appears
multiple times for systems with multiple planets. On the bottom
panels we plot the metallicity distribution of the planet-hosting
stars. The planet with the highest minimum mass is considered
for multiplanet systems. Three diﬀerent population of stars are
represented: i) high-mass planet hosts (HMPH; 600 stars, i.e.,
planet-host stars that have at least one orbiting planet with a
minimum mass greater than 30 M⊕); ii) low-mass planet hosts
(LMPH; 61 stars); and iii) a sample of 1111 stars located in the
solar neighborhood taken from the HARPS sample discussed in
Adibekyan et al. (2012). We note that about 15% of the solar
neighborhood sample stars are known to host planets. Our goal
is not to compare with nonhost stars, but to compare with the
general distribution of stars.

Both cases (planet counts, and planet host counts) are rep-
resented in Fig. 4 where we show the metallicity distribution of
the diﬀerent populations in the left panels and in the right pan-
els we present the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
distributions that allow us to better compare the diﬀerent distri-
butions.

As expected, the increasing number of exoplanets contin-
ues to reinforce the metallicity correlation observed for mas-
sive planets, while for the LMP the distribution is clearly dif-
ferent, especially when we compare the LMPH with the neigh-
borhood stars, where the resemblances are remarkable and using
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test we cannot clearly distinct these
stars. Just for comparison, in Sousa et al. (2011b) we had only
10 planet-host stars with exo-Neptunes, while we are consider-
ing 61 planet-host stars. Table 3 shows the statistics and p-values
of the diﬀerent populations comparisons that we discuss in this
work.

Given the similarities between the metallicity distributions
of LMPs and the neighborhood stars, and assuming that all these
LMPs are included in stars in the solar neighborhood (which
is not far from reality since most of these planet-host stars are
bright stars observed by RV follow up), this would of course lead
to a ﬂat distribution of the LMP frequency in the solar neighbor-
hood as already shown in our previous works (Sousa et al. 2008,
2011b).

5. Summary

In this work we update SWEET-Cat with new precise and ho-
mogeneous spectroscopic parameters using spectra that we col-
lected from diﬀerent sources. We describe in detail all the
sources of our spectroscopic data used to compile this catalog.

We also update some of the previous stellar parameters listed
in the catalog where we conﬁrm the consistency of our results.
The new homogeneous parameters are also compared with liter-
ature values showing generally good agreement, but with a sig-
niﬁcant improvement for several speciﬁc host stars. We demon-

strate in this work that our spectroscopic analysis method to de-
rive stellar parameters provides very consistent results when an-
alyzing the same stars with many diﬀerent high-resolution spec-
trographs.

Finally the known planet-host metallicity correlations are re-
viewed focusing on the diﬀerences found between stars hosting
LMPs and stars hosting massive planets. While the giant planet
hosts have the clear metallicity correlation, we show that the
stars hosting LMPs (with a minimum mass below 30 M⊕) are
indistinguishable from the solar neighborhood.
