ABSTRACT
Here we present results from over 500 kiloseconds Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the cool core of the Centaurus
cluster. We investigate the spatial distributions of the O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni abundances in the intracluster
medium with CCD detectors, and those of N, O, Ne, Mg, Fe, and Ni with the ReÔ¨Çection Grating Spectrometer (RGS). The
abundances of most of the elements show a sharp drop within the central 18 arcsec, although diÔ¨Äerent detectors and atomic codes
give signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent values. The abundance ratios of the above elements, including Ne/Fe with RGS, show relatively Ô¨Çat
radial distributions. In the innermost regions with the dominant Fe-L lines, the measurements of the absolute abundances are
challenging. For example, AtomDB and SPEXACT give Fe = 0.5 and 1.4 solar, respectively, for the spectra from the innermost
region. These results suggest some systematic uncertainties in the atomic data and response matrices at least partly cause the
abundance drop rather than the metal depletion into the cold dust. Except for super-solar N/Fe and Ni/Fe, sub-solar Ne/Fe, and
Mg/Fe, the abundance pattern agrees with the solar composition. The entire pattern is challenging to reproduce with the latest
supernova nucleosynthesis models. Observed super-solar N/O and comparable Mg abundance to stellar metallicity proÔ¨Åles imply
the mass-loss winds dominate the intracluster medium in the brightest cluster galaxy. The solar Cr/Fe and Mn/Fe ratios indicate
a signiÔ¨Åcant contribution of near- and sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions of Type Ia supernovae.

1 INTRODUCTION

Elemental abundances in stars and gas in the Universe provide strin-
gent constraints on the formation and evolutionary history of galaxies.
Excluding primordial elements in the Universe like H, He, Li, and
Be, other heavy chemical elements were synthesised in stars and ex-
pelled into interstellar space by supernovae (SNe). Light ùõº-elements
(O, Ne, Mg) mainly originate from core-collapse SNe (CCSNe), and
Fe-peak ones (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) are, on the other hand, produced by
thermonuclear explosions in Type Ia SNe (SNeIa). The intermediate-
mass elements (IMEs), i.e. Si, S, Ar, and Ca, are synthesised by
both SNeIa and CCSNe (e.g., Nomoto et al. 2013, and references
therein). Unlike these elements, N is mainly synthesised in low- or
intermediate-mass stars and expelled into the interstellar medium
(ISM) through stellar mass loss (e.g., Nomoto et al. 2013).

The intracluster medium (ICM), hot X-ray emitting plasma pervad-
ing the galaxy clusters, retains a dominant fraction of heavy elements
(e.g., N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni) synthesised
by stars and SN explosions in member galaxies. The abundance of
these elements can be well constrained from the intensity of their
K-shell emission lines within the X-ray band (e.g., Mernier et al.
2018a, for a recent review). Therefore, X-ray spectroscopy of the
ICM is one of the most reliable ways to investigate the chemical
enrichment history in clusters (e.g., de Plaa et al. 2007; Sato et al.
2007; Mernier et al. 2018b). In the last few decades, spatially resolved

spectra of the ICM observed with modern X-ray observatories like
Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku have allowed us to study the
spatial distribution of metals in the ICM. Outside the core regions,
Ô¨Çat and azimuthally uniform Fe distributions towards the outskirts
have been reported (e.g., Matsushita 2011; Matsushita et al. 2013a;
Werner et al. 2013; Simionescu et al. 2015; Urban et al. 2017). This
remarkably extended Fe distribution requires the early enrichment of
the ICM before the cluster formation, i.e. ten billion years ago, also
supported by cosmological simulations (e.g., BiÔ¨É et al. 2018).

X-ray luminous clusters showing a strong surface brightness peak
towards the centre, i.e. cool-core clusters, are ideal targets to study
ongoing enrichment process by the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs).
Most of them are classiÔ¨Åed as elliptical, and located in the X-ray peak
of the cool cores. Observational studies of the metal abundances in
cool cores provide a powerful probe for where and when metals
were dispersed into the ICM. A central Fe abundance excess within
the ICM was Ô¨Årst reported in the Centaurus cluster by ROSAT and
ASCA (Allen & Fabian 1994; Fukazawa et al. 1994). Many other
cool-core clusters exhibit similar trends for metal abundances (e.g.,
De Grandi & Molendi 2001; Million et al. 2011; Mernier et al. 2017).
To produce the central Fe abundance peaks, B√∂hringer et al. (2004)
proposed enrichment by SNeIa over a relatively long time (> 5 Gyr).
In addition, metal enrichment by CCSNe when the cluster galaxies
were still actively star-forming has been discussed based on central
peaks of ùõº-elements (e.g., de Plaa et al. 2006; Simionescu et al. 2009;
Mernier et al. 2017; Erdim et al. 2021). Recent observation in the
Perseus cluster core by Hitomi provided compelling results that the

O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and
Ni/Fe abundance ratios in the ICM are fully consistent with those
in the solar, and therefore the Milky Way (Hitomi Collaboration
et al. 2017; Simionescu et al. 2019). This solar chemical composi-
tion in the Perseus core requires not only CCSN but also near- and
sub-Chandrasekhar mass (ùëÄCh) SNIa contribution to the enrichment
of the ICM. Although the abundance ratio pattern could not be re-
produced suÔ¨Éciently by the latest SN nucleosynthesis models, the
study of the Perseus core provided an important clue to chemical
enrichment in the cluster centre and possibly BCG.

Within a central few-kiloparsec, the situation is more puzzling
and fascinating in the innermost core. Since the Ô¨Årst discovery in
A2199 (Johnstone et al. 2002), central abundance drops are reported
especially for Fe in some cool-core clusters wherein the enhanced
enrichment is expected from the central BCG (e.g., Churazov et al.
2003; Panagoulia et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2019). The central abundance
drop in the Centaurus cluster was Ô¨Årst discovered by Sanders &
Fabian (2002) with a remarkable depletion from
0.5 solar
towards the centre. With optical and infrared observations, cold dust
Ô¨Ålaments are detected in BCGs (e.g., Crawford et al. 2005; Mittal
et al. 2011, for the Centaurus cluster), and Panagoulia et al. (2015)
proposed that these abundance drops would be caused by depletion of
metals into the cool dust grains in the BCG. Lakhchaura et al. (2019)
reported that the abundance of the ‚Äònon-reactive‚Äô element Ar shows
a relatively slight central drop, while Si and S show a remarkable
abundance drop as Fe. The abundance drops may originate from the
feedback of active galactic nuclei which would dissipate a fraction
of central metal-rich gas towards the outer radius (e.g., Sanders et al.
2016; Liu et al. 2019).

The Centaurus cluster, also known as A3526, is a well-known
cool-core cluster, within which NGC 4696 is residing as the BCG.
Because being a nearby and X-ray luminous galaxy cluster, the Cen-
taurus cluster is one of the most compelling examples as well as the
Perseus cluster for studies of the metal abundance in the ICM. It has
been reported that the abundance in a few-arcmin core of the Cen-
taurus cluster shows super-solar (
1.5‚Äì2 solar) value for IMEs and
‚àº
Fe by X-ray missions like Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku (e.g.,
Matsushita et al. 2007; Takahashi et al. 2009; Sakuma et al. 2011;
Sanders et al. 2016). The Fe abundance in other cluster cores, on the
other hand, is typically sub-solar (
0.8 solar), which is close to those
‚àº
of groups and early-type galaxies (e.g., Konami et al. 2014; Mernier
et al. 2018c). Then, the Centaurus cluster core do be the speciÔ¨Åc but
ideal target for a comprehensive study of SNIa contribution to the
enrichment due to the high Fe abundance.

In this paper, we analyse the deepest CCD data with Chandra
and XMM-Newton to date of the cool core of the Centaurus cluster
and NGC 4696. We study the spatial distributions of metal abun-
dances of O, Mg, IMEs, and Fe-peak elements, including Cr, Mn,
and Ni, to constrain the metal enrichment history by the BCG. In
addition, we analyse grating data onboard XMM-Newton to study
the spatial distribution of Ne and N. Due to its non-chemical re-
activity, radial distribution of the Ne abundance would be crucial
to restrict the mechanism of abundance drops at the cluster centre.
We also make a comparison between the latest versions of two dif-
ferent atomic codes, the atomic data base (AtomDB, Foster et al.
2012) and the spex Atomic Code and Tables (SPEXACT, Kaastra
et al. 1996), which have been updated in response to Hitomi (Hit-
omi Collaboration et al. 2018b). This paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we describe details of our Chandra and XMM-Newton
observations and data reduction. In Section 3, we present our spec-
tral analysis. We discuss the results in Section 4 and present our
conclusions in Section 5. In this paper, we assume cosmological pa-

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

We used the publicly archival observation data of the core region
of the Centaurus cluster with the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging
Spectrometer (ACIS, Weisskopf et al. 2002), the European Photon
Imaging Camera (EPIC, Turner et al. 2001; Str√ºder et al. 2001),
and ReÔ¨Çecting Grating Spectrometer (RGS, den Herder et al. 2001)
on-board XMM-Newton. Table 1 lists the observations used in this
work.

2.1 Chandra

We used Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations (ciao) ver-
sion 4.12 (Fruscione et al. 2006) and calibration database (caldb)
version 4.8.4.1 for the following data reduction. We reprocessed the
data with chandra_repro tool keeping the standard procedure by
Chandra team, and remove strong background Ô¨Çares using deflare
script in the ciao package. The cleaned ACIS data have a total ex-
posure of 640 ks after the procedures stated above. We also searched
for faint point sources using the wavdetect algorithm in the energy
range of 0.5‚Äì7.0 keV (encircled counts fraction = 0.9, threshold sig-
6), excluding sources detected at the cluster centre
niÔ¨Åcance = 10‚àí
and the surrounding ICM (e.g., plume-like structure, Sanders et al.
2016). We extracted ACIS spectra from the annular regions shown in
Fig. 1(a) and generated redistribution matrix Ô¨Åles (RMFs) and ancil-
lary response Ô¨Åles (ARFs) for each ObsID. The outermost radius of
our extracting regions (240 arcsec) is about three times the eÔ¨Äective
radius (ùëÖe) of NGC 4696 (
85 arcsec, Carollo et al. 1993), indicat-
ing that most of stars in NGC 4696 are within our extraction regions.
In addition, this aperture is close to a radius at which the ICM tem-
perature starts to decline towards the centre (Sanders et al. 2016).
The spectra and response Ô¨Åles taken in the same observation years
are coadded to improve the photon statistics. Background spectra are
extracted from all Ô¨Åeld of view of ACIS-S3 chip out of 3 arcmin core
centred on the cluster centre.

‚àº

2.2 XMM-Newton

2.2.1 EPIC

The reduction procedure for the data sets of XMM-Newton was per-
formed using the XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (sas) ver-
sion 18.0.0. We reprocessed and Ô¨Åltered all the EPIC data using
emchain and epchain for the MOS and pn, respectively. The exclud-
ing sources are taken from the Chandra ACIS detection (Fig. 1(a)) at
the same position and radius. All reprocess procedures are in accor-
dance with the standard reduction criteria by sas. After the reprocess,
the total exposure times are 550 ks (MOS), and 380 ks (pn). For each
observation, we extracted EPIC spectra from the same annular re-
gions as Chandra (Fig. 1(b)) and generated RMFs and ARFs for each
ObsID, but did not merge them because the aim points of each ob-
servation are signiÔ¨Åcantly shifted. We Ô¨Åt the spectra of MOS1 and
MOS2 jointly with the same spectral parameters. The background
spectra were extracted from the annular region with 7.5‚Äì11.7 arcmin.

2.2.2 RGS

The RGS spectra provide us spatial information of extended emission
over 5 arcmin width along the cross-dispersion direction when the
X-ray peak of the target locates near the pointing position (e.g., Chen
et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2019). Thus, we used only two datasets
in 2002 and 2007 which have quite smaller oÔ¨Äsets than the others
(see Table 1). The RGS data were processed with rgsproc. After
Ô¨Åltering Ô¨Çared events as well as the EPIC data, the remaining total
exposure time is 140 ks. As done by Chen et al. (2018), we extracted
Ô¨Årst- and second-order RGS spectra centred on the emission peak
along the dispersion direction instead of using the xpsfincl which
is generally used. For each annular region within 120 arcsec for the
CCD spectra, we Ô¨Åltered events by the cross-dispersion direction and
extracted spectra over two wide regions on both sides. For instance,
the two wide regions for 60‚Äì120 arcsec are plotted in Fig. 1(b). The
Ô¨Årst- and second-order spectra are jointly Ô¨Åtted, where the RGS1 and
RGS2 spectra of each order are combined.

3 ANALYSIS & RESULTS

3.1 Spectral Fitting

3.1.1 CCD spectra

Here we analyse X-ray spectra extracted from the annular regions
given in Fig. 1 using xspec package version 12.10.1f (Arnaud 1996).
We use the latest AtomDB 1 version 3.0.9 to model a collisional ion-
ization equilibrium (CIE) plasma. We model and Ô¨Åt the background
spectra simultaneously with the source spectra, instead of subtracting
them from the source data. The detector background model consists

1 http://www.atomdb.org

of a broken power-law with Gaussian lines for the instrumental Ô¨Çuo-
rescence lines like Al-K, Si-K, and Cu-K (e.g., Leccardi & Molendi
2008; Mernier et al. 2015). We also take the background celestial
emissions into account with a power-law (1.4 photon index) for the
cosmic X-ray background and two CIE plasma components with
solar metallicity for the local hot bubble (LHB) and the Galactic
thermal emission (e.g. Yoshino et al. 2009). These components ex-
cept for the LHB are modiÔ¨Åed by the Galactic absorption and the
temperature of the LHB is Ô¨Åxed at 0.1 keV. The derived tempera-
ture of the Galactic thermal emission is 0.94
0.02 keV, indicating
that the Centaurus cluster is located at a high-temperature region of
the Galactic emission (Yoshino et al. 2009; Nakashima et al. 2018).
Because the ICM of the Centaurus cluster is extended over several
degrees, the emission component from the ICM is also included in
the spectral Ô¨Åtting model for the background region. In the following
spectral analysis, we Ô¨Åt all spectra using the C-statistics (Cash 1979),
to estimate the model parameters and their error ranges without bias
(Kaastra 2017). The spectra are rebinned to have a minimum of 1
count per spectral bin. The stacked spectra of the central 240 arcsec
region are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2. Emission lines of O,
Fe-L (+ Ne), Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe and Ni (+ Fe) are clearly seen in
the spectra. In addition, there are some hints of Cr and Mn lines in
the pn spectrum.

¬±

Systematic uncertainties in the response matrices and atomic codes
bias measurements of line and continuum temperatures. Therefore,
we adopt bvvtapec model, which allows diÔ¨Äerent temperatures for
the line and continuum (e.g., Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2018a,
for detailed discussion). The ICM spectra are modelled with a triple
bvvtapec components to consider the multi-temperature structure in
the cool core. We assume the three thermal components have the same
metal abundances. The Galactic absorption is modelled using the
phabs assuming the photoelectric absorption cross-sections taken
from Verner et al. (1996). We let the absorption column density ùëÅH
and elemental abundance of O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and

Ni vary freely. The abundances of elements lighter than O are Ô¨Åxed
to solar. The other element abundances are tied to those of the nearest
lower atomic number element, which is allowed to vary. For example,
the F abundance is linked to that of O. The line and continuum
temperatures for the middle- and coolest-temperature components
cannot be well constrained independently and thus are assumed to be
halved and quartered the hottest-temperature ones, respectively. We
also let the volume emission measure (VEM) free to vary, given as
‚à´ ùëõùëíùëõHùëëùëâ
, where ùëõùëí and ùëõH is electron and proton density,
ùëâ and ùê∑ are the volume of the emission region and the distance
to the emitting source, respectively. This model gives good Ô¨Åts to
the spectra of the individual annular regions, yielding C-stat/dof
1‚Äì1.3 as summarised in Table 2 and Fig. 2. Since the diÔ¨Äerences
‚àº
between line and continuum temperatures are small (< 0.3 keV),
we hereafter report the continuum temperature as representative. As

4ùúãùê∑2

/(

)

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì18 (2022)

shown in Fig. 3, the diÔ¨Äerent CCD detectors give consistent VEM-
weighted average temperatures (denoted ùëòùëá) for each annular region.
This proÔ¨Åle shows a peak temperature of
3 keV and a clear drop
towards the centre, which is consistent with a more extended proÔ¨Åle
by Sanders et al. (2016). Therefore, our extracting regions cover an
important part of the cool core of the Centaurus cluster as noted in
¬ß 2.1.

‚àº

Next, we re-Ô¨Åt the spectra within local energy bands around the K-
shell emission lines of the individual elements in order to minimize
biases due to the response uncertainty on the metal abundance mea-
surements, i.e. we perform local or narrow-band Ô¨Åts (e.g., Lakhchaura
et al. 2019; Simionescu et al. 2019). The ratios of each VEM are Ô¨Åxed
to the value of global Ô¨Åt, leaving the abundance of a considered ele-
ment to vary freely and tying all other parameters to the global Ô¨Åt val-
ues in Table 2. The boundaries of these local bands are 0.51‚Äì0.77 keV
for O, 0.75‚Äì1.25 keV for Ne, 1.36‚Äì1.59 keV for Mg, 1.65‚Äì2.26 keV
for Si, 2.37‚Äì4.44 keV for other intermediate-mass elements (IMEs),
i.e. S, Ar, and Ca, 5.01‚Äì6.59 keV for Cr and Mn, 6.25‚Äì7.25 keV for
Fe, and 7.24‚Äì8.02 keV for Ni. Here, to avoid contaminations from
the strong instrumental Cu line, we use the two observations point-
ing towards the cluster centre for the local-Ô¨Åts around the Ni lines
of the pn spectra. The representative spectrum and the best-Ô¨Åtting
residuals around each prominent line are plotted in the lower panels
of Fig. 2. The obtained elemental abundances with the local Ô¨Åts are
shown in Table 3 and 4. In Fig. 4, we compare the derived abundances
from the global and local Ô¨Åts. The abundance values and the residual
structure around each K-shell emission line with two Ô¨Åt methods are
globally similar except for the Cr abundances. The Ne abundances
with two Ô¨Åt methods are globally consistent, except for the results
with pn which oÔ¨Äers a relatively lower spectral resolution than that
of MOS. However, the Ne K-shell emission lines are blended in the
Fe-L bump, and thus, our estimation of the Ne abundances from the
CCD spectra would be suÔ¨Äered from some systematic uncertainties.
The Mg-K shell lines are also blended in the Fe-L bump. The Mg
abundances with pn and ACIS show a relatively large scatter, while
those with MOS, possibly the most reliable instrument among the
three, are consistent except for only one point. We suspect that these
discrepancies are mainly caused by the moderate spectral resolution
and/or sensitivity of the pn and ACIS instruments. The local Ô¨Åts
around the Fe-K lines mostly give consistent results with those from
the global Ô¨Åts. The exceptions are the three regions within 60 arcsec
with Chandra and the innermost region with pn, where the local Ô¨Åts
give even lower Fe abundances than the global Ô¨Åts. Hereafter, we use
the results of the global Ô¨Åts for the Fe abundance, and those of the
local Ô¨Åts for the other elements.

3.1.2 RGS spectra

We Ô¨Åt the high-resolution X-ray spectra of RGS with the almost same
spectral model described in ¬ß3.1.1, considering the spectral broad-
ening eÔ¨Äect due to the spatial extent of the source using rgsxsrc
model with MOS1 images. The Ô¨Årst- and second-order spectra for
each observation are simultaneously Ô¨Åtted. Since contributions of
the astrophysical background emissions are relatively minor to the
spectra of the innermost core regions, we only take into account the
instrumental component with a steep power-law model. We assume
the line and continuum temperatures are the same because the con-
tinuum temperatures are poorly constrained with the RGS spectra.
We also Ô¨Åx the Galactic absorption to the values estimated through
the tool of Willingale et al. (2013). As shown in Fig. 5, RGS enables
us to rather resolve the Ne lines from the Fe-L lines. In addition,
N-Ly ùõº emission line (
0.5 keV) is clearly seen in RGS spectra.

Figure 2. Upper: The stacked spectra of the central 240 arcsec region for each CCD camera, all of which are folded through the spectral response of each
detector. The black, red, and blue data represent ACIS-S, MOS, and pn spectra, respectively. We also plot narrow band spectra in order to show the emission lines
of Fe-peak elements. Lower: The representative spectra extracted from 18‚Äì60 arcsec annular region for MOS and best-Ô¨Åtting models enlarging on prominent
K-shell emission lines. The black and magenta residuals represent the global and local Ô¨Åt results, respectively (see ¬ß 3.1.1 for detail). The pn spectrum is also
plotted with diamonds for the Fe-peak elements. Emission lines for some elements are marked.

Then, we allow N, O, Ne, Mg, Fe and Ni abundances to vary, and C
abundance is Ô¨Åxed to the solar value. The other element abundances
are tied to those of the nearest lower atomic number element, which
is allowed to vary. As shown in Fig. 5, this model yields good Ô¨Åts
with C-stat/dof
1.0. The best-Ô¨Åtting parameters are summarised in
Table 2, 3, and Fig. 5, respectively. Although the individual spectral
extraction regions for RGS are not identical to those for the CCDs
as indicated in ¬ß 2.2, the VEM-weighted average temperatures from
the two kinds of detectors are consistent when the inner radius of the
CCD region and the inner cross-dispersion distance of the RGS are
the same (Fig. 3).

3.2 Abundance ProÔ¨Åles

As described in Section 1, our purpose is to study the central metal
distribution in the Centaurus cluster. In Fig. 6, we show radial pro-
Ô¨Åles of elemental abundances except for those of Cr and Mn, which
have large statistical uncertainties. The derived abundances of Fe and
IMEs show steep negative gradients beyond 120 arcsec from the clus-
ter centre, are peaked at 60‚Äì120 arcsec and abrupt drops within the
central 18 arcsec. In contrast, O, Ne and Mg have somewhat Ô¨Çatter
proÔ¨Åles beyond 120 arcsec. The discrepancies among the abundances
from diÔ¨Äerent detectors are signiÔ¨Åcant, about a factor of two at most,
especially within the Fe abundance peak. The RGS tends to give
lower values of metal abundances than those from the CCDs, with a
more signiÔ¨Åcant abundance drop than that with CCDs. These proÔ¨Åles

obtained from our analysis are roughly consistent with those from
previous works (Panagoulia et al. 2013; Sanders et al. 2016; Liu et al.
2019; Lakhchaura et al. 2019). Moreover, our RGS analysis provides
Ô¨Årst the Ne abundance proÔ¨Åle showing a similar drop with Fe, al-
though there had been no hint of declination of the Ne abundance
from works with CCD data (Liu et al. 2019).

As shown in Fig. 7, the abundance ratios to Fe, X/Fe, show Ô¨Çat
distributions, although the S/Fe, Ar/Fe, and Ca/Fe ratios within the
central 60 arcsec are higher by a few tens of per cent than those
beyond 120 arcsec. The scatters in the X/Fe ratios among the diÔ¨Äerent
detectors are much smaller than those in the absolute abundances.
Exceptionally, RGS and CCDs yield signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent Ne/Fe
ratios. Considering that the Ne-K lines are blended in the Fe-L lines
with the CCD as mentioned in ¬ß 3.1.1, we expect RGS gives more
reliable Ne/Fe ratios. Although the O/Fe ratios with pn are about
a factor of two lower than those with MOS, which has a slightly
better energy resolution than pn, are consistent with those derived
from the RGS spectra. Therefore, for CCSN products of O, Ne, and
additionally Mg, we will discuss only the results with RGS data,
which would provide a better estimate of these abundances with its
high spectral resolution. The Ca/Fe ratios among the CCD detectors
show discrepancies of about 50 per cent at most, while the other
IMEs/Fe ratios are consistent with each other.

3.3 Systematic Uncertainties

Various systematic uncertainties sometimes give biases in abundance
measurements in cool cores (e.g., Werner et al. 2008). For example,
simple temperature modelling to a complex structure in cores would
lead to underestimation of abundances, especially when Ô¨Åtting spec-
tra with strong Fe-L lines (e.g., Buote & Canizares 1997; Matsushita
et al. 2003). Therefore, we also estimate the abundances using other
temperature structure models; two and four CIE components. For the
four-CIE model, the temperature of the coolest component is half of
that of the second coolest one as the temperatures of this model mak-
ing a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.5. Even for the
innermost region, these models give almost the same Fe abundances
within several per cent with those derived in the previous subsec-
tion. Since the quadruple model yields unnaturally low VEM for one
component (< 1 per cent of the other three) and almost the same C-
statistic values, we conclude that the three temperature-components
model is suÔ¨Écient to model the emission from the Centaurus core.

Projection of X-ray emission along the line of sight could also
obscure the actual distribution of temperature or abundances. Since
the Centaurus cluster core deviates from spherical symmetry due to
the plume-like structure, we do not apply the deprojection method

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì18 (2022)

often used to analyse the X-ray emission from cluster cores (e.g.,
Ettori 2002; Ikebe et al. 2004; Russell et al. 2008). Instead, we Ô¨Åt the
innermost spectra using a sextuple-CIE model. Here, we Ô¨Årst Ô¨Åt the
spectra of the outermost bin, or 180‚Äì240 arcsec region, with a single-
CIE model. Then, we Ô¨Åt the spectra of 120‚Äì180 arcsec region with a
two-CIE model, where one CIE component has the same temperature
and metal abundances as those at the outermost region. Finally, we
Ô¨Åt the innermost spectra using a sextuple-CIE model. Then, we get
almost the same metal abundances within 10 per cent as those with
the three-component CIE model.

Next, in order to study the uncertainties caused by systematics in
the atomic data, we Ô¨Åt the spectra of the MOS and RGS with the
SPEXACT version 3.06.01 (Kaastra et al. 1996). We plot the derived
abundances and relative abundance ratios to Fe with AtomDB and
SPEXACT in Fig. 8. We do not report the results for Ne in Fig. 8(a)
because the Ne-K lines are blended into the Fe-L complex in CCD
spectra. With MOS data, the latest version of SPEXACT gives almost
the same abundances except for the O abundances. With RGS, SPEX-
ACT yields nearly constant metal abundances in the core, which are
signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent from those with AtomDB (Fig. 8(b)). On the
other hand, the abundance ratios with RGS are mostly consistent

Table 3. Abundances of N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe derived from the local Ô¨Åts (CCDs) and the global Ô¨Åts (RGS) with respect to the proto-solar values

within a few tens of per cent for all elements between both atomic
codes (Fig. 8(c)). The diÔ¨Äerences of
20 per cent in the O/Fe ratios
and Ne/Fe ratios between AtomDB and SPEXACT may be caused
by systematic uncertainties in the Fe-L atomic code. We note that
the Ne/O ratios with RGS from SPEXACT and AtomDB agree with
each other.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Abundance Measurements in the Innermost Regions

As described in Section 1, the mechanisms of the abundance deple-
tions sometimes reported in cluster cores are still under discussion.
We also detect abrupt abundance drops within central 18 arcsec for
most elements. Panagoulia et al. (2013) and Lakhchaura et al. (2019)
proposed that these drops arise from cool dust grains in the cluster
centre to which a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of metals is locked up. If this
is the case, we expect that the abundance of non-reactive elements,
i.e., the noble gas, show no central drop. Lakhchaura et al. (2019) re-
ported that only the Ar/Fe ratio in the Centaurus cluster core slightly
increases towards the centre while the Ar abundance still shows a
central drop as other metals. They concluded that the drops are due
to the incorporation of metals into dust grains. Our Ar/Fe proÔ¨Åle
from the longer exposure data also shows a slight increase towards
the cluster centre from 120 arcsec and is consistent within error bars
with that derived by Lakhchaura et al. (2019). However, we get a Ô¨Çat

proÔ¨Åle within (cid:46) 60 arcsec where the abundance drop occurs (Fig. 7).
We note that the increasing proÔ¨Åle of the Ar/Fe ratio by Lakhchaura
et al. (2019) is partially attributed to their region selection with the
(cid:46) 30 arcsec innermost bin. This larger radius than ours is suitable for
XMM-Newton but probably makes a too much concession to the ex-
tremely high angular resolution of the Chandra ACIS (
0.5 arcsec),
which could blur the innermost metal distribution in exchange for
photon statistics. Our Ar/Fe proÔ¨Åle is quite similar to that of the
Ca/Fe ratios even though Ca can be easily trapped into dust grains.
In addition, we Ô¨Ånd that the Ne/Fe proÔ¨Åle using RGS is also Ô¨Çat
towards the centre. These results do not support the grain origin for
the abundance drops.

‚àº

The diÔ¨Äerent detectors and diÔ¨Äerent plasma codes give signiÔ¨Å-
cantly inconsistent elemental abundances, while the discrepancies in
the abundance ratios are relatively small. To investigate the origin
of these discrepancies, we Ô¨Åx the Fe abundance at the peak value
(
1.7 solar at 60‚Äì120 arcsec) and Ô¨Åt the spectra of the innermost
‚àº
region (< 5 arcsec) of RGS and MOS. As shown In Fig. 9, this high
Fe abundance model reproduces the continuum and most of the line
emissions for both AtomDB and SPEXACT, yielding similar abun-
dance ratios. With AtomDB, the derived C-stat/dof for the RGS
spectrum, 5363.8/5663, is signiÔ¨Åcantly larger than 5303.1/5662 with
the best-Ô¨Åtting Fe abundance at 0.58 solar. This large C-statistic is
mainly caused by residual structures at 1.1‚Äì1.2 keV energy band,
rather than the diÔ¨Äerence in the equivalent width of lines. In con-
trast, as shown In Fig. 9, SPEXACT, which yields the best-Ô¨Åtting Fe

abundance of 1.4 solar at the innermost region, does not show such
residual structures. When we exclude the 0.9‚Äì1.2 keV band where the
abovementioned discrepancy between two codes is exhibiting, the
derived Fe abundance with AtomDB becomes 1.2
0.3 solar. This
value mostly converges to that with SPEXACT and also that with
MOS data, although the Fe abundance with MOS data under the
same excision is not signiÔ¨Åcantly changed. Thus, while the Fe abun-
dance drop is not dissolved completely, quite a sharp drop with RGS
data could be attenuated. The disagreement between the latest version
of AtomDB and SPEXACT occurs for Fe xxiii and Ne x emission
lines around 1.2 keV. These deÔ¨Åcits around this energy band have
been reported since ASCA, especially in luminous X-ray sources like
binaries or SN remnants (e.g., Brickhouse et al. 2000; Katsuda et al.
2015; Nakano et al. 2017). We also Ô¨Åt the RGS and MOS spectra at
the 60‚Äì120 arcsec region in the same way, Ô¨Åxing the Fe abundance
at 0.5 and 1.7 solar. Then, as seen in the bottom-right panel of Fig. 9,
the low Fe abundance models cannot reproduce the line strength of
the Fe line at 6.7 keV.

The systematic uncertainties in the derived abundances from
1 keV plasma have been discussed (e.g., Arimoto et al. 1997; Mat-
‚àº
sushita et al. 1997, 2000; Mernier et al. 2020a; Gastaldello et al.
2021). The two-photon and free-bound emissions by heavy elements
contribute to the continuum, especially for the lower temperature
plasma in the innermost regions. Spectral Ô¨Åts try to reduce C-statistics
for the lower energy band with high statistics, where the line emis-
sions dominate the continuum. Then, minor systematic uncertainties
in the atomic data and/or in the response matrices can bias the derived
abundances. The local Ô¨Åts around the Fe-He ùõº line also give abun-
dance drops, where the atomic data is expected to be much more
reliable than those for Fe-L lines. This is because the abundances
of the other elements are Ô¨Åxed to the best-Ô¨Åtting values from the
global Ô¨Åts. For example, when we Ô¨Åx the ùõº-elements abundances at
1.3 solar, the local Ô¨Åts for the Chandra < 5 arcsec region gives the
Fe abundance of 1.1 solar. Thus, measurements of absolute abun-
dances are challenging especially in the very core gas, where the
abundance drops are reported. In the hot outer regions in which the
prominent Fe-K line is detected, the absolute abundances thereof
are more reliable. In contrast, the abundance ratios are determined
from the ratios of line strengths. As a result, the two atomic codes
and diÔ¨Äerent CCDs yield more consistent abundance ratios than the
absolute abundances.

4.2 Abundance pattern of the Centaurus cluster core

We plot the absolute and relative abundance pattern in the ICM of
the Centaurus core (Fig. 10(a) and (b)). Here we use the weighted
averages of the derived abundances within (< 18 arcsec) and outside
(18‚Äì120 arcsec) the abundance drop. Outside the abundance drop, the
metal abundances from N to Ni are over-solar values, consistent with
previous X-ray studies (e.g., Matsushita et al. 2007; Takahashi et al.
2009; Sakuma et al. 2011; Sanders et al. 2016). These abundances
are signiÔ¨Åcantly larger than those observed in the Perseus cluster core
with Hitomi (Simionescu et al. 2019), other cool-core systems includ-
ing groups (Mernier et al. 2018c), and early-type galaxies (Konami
et al. 2014). The statistical uncertainties in Cr, Mn, and Ni abun-
dances are comparable to those of the Perseus cluster core (Mernier
et al. 2018c; Simionescu et al. 2019). As shown in Fig. 10(b), the
abundance ratio pattern in the Centaurus core is mostly consistent
with the solar composition and those of other cool-core systems and
early-type galaxies (e.g., Mernier et al. 2018c; Simionescu et al.
2019; Konami et al. 2014). The exceptions are the high Ni/Fe ratio,

4.2.1 Contributions from diÔ¨Äerent SN yield models

We consider a linear combination of recent SN nucleosynthesis cal-
culations to reproduce the abundance ratio pattern from the O/Fe
to Ni/Fe observed in the Centaurus core. We adopt the latest up-
date of W7 model from 2D hydrodynamics simulations (Leung &
Nomoto 2018, for near-ùëÄCh SNIa) and a double-degenerated double-
detonation explosion of a solar mass and solar metallicity white dwarf
(Shen et al. 2018, for sub-ùëÄCh SNIa). A recent calculation of ex-
ploding massive stars averaged over Salpeter initial mass function
(Salpeter 1955) calibrated using observed energy of SN 1987A (N20
model, Sukhbold et al. 2016) and the classical calculations of Nomoto
et al. (2006) are considered for CCSN yield models. These models
are plotted in Fig. 11(a) with the observed abundance ratio pattern.
To Ô¨Åt the pattern and calculate ùúí2, we consider not only the statistical
errors of the observed abundance ratios but also 20 per cent system-
atic uncertainties reÔ¨Çecting the discrepancies between the derived
abundance ratios from AtomDB and SPEXACT. Table 5 summarises
the Ô¨Åtting results with the contributions of each SN population to
the total number of SNe. The N20 model by Sukhbold et al. (2016)
gives a smaller ùúí2 than the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô model by Nomoto et al. (2006).
Since the Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios deviate from the best-Ô¨Åtting
pattern even using the N20 model, we excluded Ne, Mg, and Ni and
Ô¨Åt the abundance pattern in the same way. Then, we get a better ùúí2,
but the contributions of each SN model are consistent within the

error bars. The ratio of numbers of CCSN to the total number of SNe
is about 80 per cent with the N20 model, while it is about 90 per cent
with the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô model. This result is consistent with those for the
other clusters (e.g., Simionescu et al. 2015, 2019). Fig. 11(b) shows
the contributions of CCSN, sub-ùëÄCh, and near-ùëÄCh SNeIa to each
element for the best-Ô¨Åtting combination with the N20 model.

4.2.2 Abundance pattern of ùõº-elements

Fig. 11(a) shows that O, Ne, and Mg are predominately synthesised
by CCSNe. The discrepancies between the observed O, Ne, and Mg
abundance pattern and those by CCSN models signiÔ¨Åcantly con-
tribute to the ùúí2 in Table 5. The observed O, Ne, and Mg abundance
pattern, lower Ne and Mg abundances compared to the O abundance,
resembles that of the latest CCSN/N20 model by Sukhbold et al.
(2016) rather than the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô CCSN model by Nomoto et al.
(2006). Fig. 11(b) shows that Si, S, and Ar are mostly synthesised
by CCSNe. The combination with the N20 model, near- and sub-
ùëÄCh roughly reproduces the observed abundance pattern of these
elements and Fe. The contribution of SNeIa products is higher to Ca
than those for the other IMEs, although the observed Ca/Fe ratio is
signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the best-Ô¨Åtting combination.

4.2.3 Abundance pattern of Fe-peak elements

The observed Cr/Fe and Mn/Fe pattern is explained by a combination
of CCSNe, near-ùëÄCh SNeIa, and sub-ùëÄCh SNeIa, as for the Perseus

cluster core. As summarised in Section 1, the Fe-peak elements are
mainly forged by SNeIa, especially in the hottest layers of the explod-
ing white dwarf (e.g., Seitenzahl et al. 2013). In particular, 55Mn is
an important element since it is synthesised more by SNeIa than
CCSNe relative to Fe (Kobayashi & Nomoto 2009), while Cr/Fe and
Ni/Fe ratios are less independent of the SNIa/CCSN contributions.
As shown in Fig. 11(a), the CCSN models predict the Mn/Fe ratios
of approximately a half of the solar ratio. The observed solar Mn/Fe
ratio in the Centaurus core and other systems indicate a signiÔ¨Åcant
contribution of SNeIa products to the Fe-peak elements. The lat-
est hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Leung & Nomoto 2018) predict
that the extremely high-density core of near-ùëÄCh SNeIa synthesises
a higher fraction of neutronised isotopes like 55Mn and 58Ni than
sub-ùëÄCh ones, which is also conÔ¨Årmed by observational studies on
SNIa remnants (e.g., Yamaguchi et al. 2015; Ohshiro et al. 2021).
The observed solar Mn/Fe ratio indicates a signiÔ¨Åcant contribution
from near-ùëÄCh SNeIa. The observed Cr/Fe ratio is close to the solar
ratio like other cool-core systems (e.g., Mernier et al. 2018c). When
Ô¨Åtted with a model of either near-ùëÄCh SNIa or sub-ùëÄCh SNeIa with
a contribution from CCSNe (N20), the ùúí2/dof value becomes 14.3/9
and 26.2/9, respectively, favouring both progenitor types of SNIa

substantially contributing to the enrichment. The contribution of the
sub-ùëÄCh SNeIa is also needed to explain the observed solar Cr/Fe
and Mn/Fe pattern.

Although we use the latest atomic code revised after the Hitomi
observations of the Perseus core, the observed Ni/Fe ratios of the
Centaurus cluster, 1.5‚Äì2 times the solar ratio, are signiÔ¨Åcantly higher
than the solar ratio of the Perseus cluster core (Simionescu et al.
2019) and the 44 cool-core systems (Mernier et al. 2018c). In our
Galaxy, both CCSN and SNIa have synthesised Ni in the same way
as Fe, since the Ni/Fe ratio of stars is
1, with no dependence on the
Fe abundance (Feltzing & Gustafsson 1998; Gratton et al. 2003). The
observed high Ni/Fe ratio suggests that Ni synthesis in the Centaurus
cluster core might be diÔ¨Äerent from that in our Galaxy. However,
with CCD detectors, both Ni-L and K lines are blended into the Fe-L
lines and He-like Fe-KùõΩ line at 7.9 keV, respectively, and the derived
Ni abundances might be aÔ¨Äected by some systematic uncertainties.

CCSN nucleosynthesis models predict that the N/O ratio is much
less than the solar value. Unlike other light ùõº-elements like O and
Mg, the N abundance in the cool cores of some galaxy clusters and
groups, or in early-type galaxies shows super-solar values, implying a
strong chemical contamination by stellar mass loss from asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars exhibiting in these systems (e.g., Sanders
et al. 2008; Mao et al. 2019; Mernier et al. 2022). In Fig. 12, we
compare the observed N/O and those expected from AGB yields by
Karakas (2010). The observed value is consistent with the calculated

ratio assuming AGB stars with low initial mass (1‚Äì2 solar) and ini-
tial metallicity of solar composition. Thus, the observed N/O ratio
indicates the importance of mass loss from low mass AGB stars in
the BCG.

In Fig. 13, we plot the stellar metallicity proÔ¨Åles of NGC 4696
by Kobayashi & Arimoto (1999) and the average proÔ¨Åles of stars
in early-type galaxies scaled with ùëÖe by Kuntschner et al. (2010).
Here, we adopt ùëÖe ‚àº
85 arcsec of NGC 4696 (Carollo et al. 1993),
and the metallicities are converted using the proto-solar abundance
of Lodders et al. (2009). The stellar metallicity of galaxies generally
increases towards the centre (Carollo et al. 1993). At the eÔ¨Äective
radii, the stellar metallicity of ùõº-elements of these galaxies are typi-
cally close to the solar value, although the accurate metallicity could
be diÔ¨Äerent by a factor of two because of high uncertainty and poor
understanding in converts to the metalicity of Mg or Fe from strength
and depth of optical absorption lines (Kobayashi & Arimoto 1999).

In Fig. 13, we also plot the Mg and Fe proÔ¨Åles in the ICM of the
Centaurus cluster derived from the RGS observations. As described
in the previous subsection, at ùëÖe of the BCG, the accurate abun-
dances are more reliable than the innermost regions. We found that
the Mg abundances derived from X-ray measurements around ùëÖe

‚àº

‚àº

are consistent with the stellar Mg metallicity. At the inner regions,
if we adopt the high Fe abundance model without the abundance
1.7 solar, the Mg
drop described in ¬ß 4.1, i.e. the model with Fe
abundances with AtomDB and SPEXACT increase to
1 solar, and
becomes consistent with the stellar metallicity as shown in Fig. 13.
When integrating the electron density derived from the VEM pro-
Ô¨Åles out to 120 arcsec, the hot gas mass becomes 7
. This
mass is orders of magnitude higher than those in early-type galax-
ies. For example, that of a massive elliptical galaxy NGC 1404 is
108 M
(Mernier et al. 2022). Considering the ùêæ-band

2, and stellar mass-to-light
luminosity of NGC 4696 is 1.8
ratio with ùêæ-band of giant early-type galaxies are around unity (e.g.,
Nagino & Matsushita 2009), this gas mass is about 4 per cent of
the stellar mass of the BCG. Given that stars lose 10‚Äì20 per cent
of the initial mass via stellar mass loss over the Hubble time (e.g.
Courteau et al. 2014; Hopkins et al. 2022), the accumulating time

The present metal supply by SNeIa can be studied using the Fe

(e.g., Li et al. 2011). Using the injection rate of stellar wind by
Ciotti et al. (1991), the expected Fe abundance from SNeIa in the hot
ISM in early-type galaxies is at least 2 solar (e.g., Matsushita et al.
2000; Konami et al. 2014). However, the observed Fe abundances in
the ISM of early-type galaxies with Suzaku are about 1 solar (e.g.,
Konami et al. 2014). Since the temperatures of the hot ISM in early-
type galaxies are close to that of the ICM in the innermost region of
the Centaurus cluster, there may be some systematic uncertainties in
the derived metal abundances in the ISM.

Hasinger 2005), the time to congregate the observed ICM mass in the
central 120 arcsec region is about 9‚Äì10 Gyr. We found no signiÔ¨Åcant
change in this estimated time when adopting diÔ¨Äerent star forma-
tion epochs ùëß = 2 and ùëß = 3. In contrast, such a long accumulating
time could strongly overestimate the gas mass in normal early-type
galaxies (e.g., Mernier et al. 2022). Since we compare abundances
in stars and ICM which could have very diÔ¨Äerent histories from each
other, the actual accumulation time may change from our simple or
simplistic estimation. For the other clusters with more luminous cool
cores, with higher ICM masses and lower metal abundances, it may
be diÔ¨Écult to explain the observed ùõº-elements peak with stellar mass
loss (e.g. de Plaa et al. 2006; Simionescu et al. 2009; Mernier et al.
2017).

4.4 Fe mass and SNIa rate

While the total gas mass in the Centaurus core can be accounted for
by the mass ejection through stellar winds (see ¬ß 4.3), how about the
masses of each element, especially for Fe? As shown in Fig. 13, the
Fe abundances in the ICM are signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the stellar
Fe metallicity, especially around ùëÖe of the BCG, where the abso-
lute abundances are relatively reliable. In addition, the Mg/Fe ratios
in the ICM are also diÔ¨Äerent from the super-solar ùõº/Fe ratios of
stars in giant early-type galaxies (e.g., Kobayashi & Arimoto 1999;
Kuntschner et al. 2010). These results strongly suggest the additional
enrichment of Fe by SNeIa. Then, the Fe abundances in the ISM can
constrain the past metal supply by SNeIa. Adopting the stellar Fe
0.5 solar, the Fe abundance synthesised by SNeIa be-
metallicity of
1 solar. From the derived electron density and Fe abundance
comes

The ratio of the ICM mass to the stellar mass in the core of the

Our discussed enrichments by SNeIa and/or stellar winds would sug-
gest a relatively recent or even an ongoing enrichment scenario in the
Centaurus core. However, such a recent enrichment scenario hardly
explains the uniform and solar X/Fe ratio (in early-type galaxies, the
Centaurus core, and other clusters) unless SNeIa and stellar winds
have been sophisticatedly controlled to reproduce the observed abun-
dance pattern, which might be a handiwork. Recently, Mernier et al.
(2022) discussed that the abundance patterns observed in cluster or
galaxy centres are more likely produced by an early enrichment which
3 and ended around ùëß = 2. If this is the
would have started at ùëß
case, enrichment channels must be CCSNe, the earliest SNeIa, and
stellar winds whose rates are more diÔ¨Écult to be estimated accurately
than those at the present. We also note that such an early enrichment
scenario would be challenged by the escaping or depleting metals
that must have been produced subsequently unless the recent SNeIa
and stellar winds are completely quiescent. Further studies of metal
abundance, distribution, and cycle process, not only at central cores
but also at large scales will provide important clues to solving this
cosmic conundrum.

4.5 Future prospects

Future X-ray mission with high-resolution and spatially resolved
spectroscopy like XRISM is more crucial to reduce the systematic
uncertainties and to estimate the absolute abundance in the cool
innermost region of clusters. Since the observational data, the nucle-
osynthesis theories, and the atomic codes are limited at present, we
comprehend, as also discussed in ¬ß 4.1, the necessity of extremely
high-resolution spectra with micro-calorimeter detectors onboard fu-
ture missions like XRISM (XRISM Science Team 2020) or Athena
(e.g., Cucchetti et al. 2018; Mernier et al. 2020b). For example, the
Resolve instrument, which will be mounted on XRISM and deliver
a constant < 7 eV spectral resolution, enables us to fully resolve
the Ne K-shell emission line from the Fe-L complex. OÔ¨Äering its
non-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Resolve provides more accurate
spatial information of emission lines in the cluster and group centres
than those with the RGS data. By using the low-temperature region
of these targets with laboratory experiments (e.g., electron beam ion
traps, Gu et al. 2020), we expect that the remaining uncertainties or
disagreements between AtomDB and SPEXACT will continue to be
reduced. In particular, our proposed disagreement in the 0.9‚Äì1.2 keV
band, possibly attributed to mismodelling of the Fe xxiii and Ne x
emission lines (see ¬ß 4.1), will be an urgent issue to be resolved. Based
on these upcoming leaps, XRISM and/or Athena will provide crucial
knowledge of metal content in the cluster or group centres, including
the abundance drop, as discussed in Gastaldello et al. (2021).

Furthermore, it is important that the trace odd-ùëç elements other
than N could also be a sensitive diagnostic of the initial metallicity
of CCSN progenitors (e.g., Nomoto et al. 2006, 2013) or of the
stellar population (e.g., Campbell & Lattanzio 2008; Karakas 2010).
Unfortunately, we are not able to constrain the abundance of these
elements while using present grating data. The micro-calorimeter
instruments mounted on Hitomi have been shown enough resolution
and sensitivity to constrain the abundance of trace odd-ùëç elements

MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì18 (2022)

(e.g., Simionescu et al. 2019), which makes us expect invaluable
information about the underlying stellar population contributing to
the early enrichment history of the ICM.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The elemental abundances in the cluster cool cores provide a key to
understanding the chemical enrichment of the central BCG and the
surrounding ICM. We report the detailed distributions of elements in
the ICM expelled by SNe using the deep Chandra and XMM-Newton
observations of the cool core of the Centaurus cluster of galaxies.
While the abundance drop in the innermost region is observed as
previous studies (e.g., Panagoulia et al. 2013; Lakhchaura et al. 2019;
Liu et al. 2019), we Ô¨Ånd that the relative abundance ratios to Fe yield
Ô¨Çat proÔ¨Åles towards the centre, even for noble gas elements, Ne/Fe
and Ar/Fe. In addition, a much higher Fe abundance model without
an abundance drop also reproduces the spectra of the innermost
region, excluding the Fe-L complex around 1.2 keV with ATOMDB.
These results suggest that the abundance drop may be at least partly
artiÔ¨Åcially caused by some systematic uncertainties in the atomic data
and/or response matrices, rather than the metal depletion process on
to the cold dust grains.

0.6‚Äì0.9 solar) and the N/Fe ratio is higher (

The measured abundance pattern shows that the Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe,
Ca/Fe, Cr/Fe, and Mn/Fe ratios are close to the solar values. On the
other hand, the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios tend to be lower
1.5 solar). Even us-
(
‚àº
ing the latest versions of atomic code, the Ni/Fe ratio (
2 solar) is
signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the solar ratio and that of the Perseus core
(Simionescu et al. 2019). Taking the systematic uncertainties (e.g.,
atomic codes) into account, we test linear combination models of
recent SN yield calculations for near- and sub-ùëÄCh SNIa (Leung &
Nomoto 2018 and Shen et al. 2018, respectively), and CCSN (N20,
Sukhbold et al. 2016; ‚Äòclassical‚Äô, Nomoto et al. 2006) in order to
reproduce these abundance ratios. We Ô¨Ånd that the contribution of
both near- and sub-ùëÄCh SNIa is needed to explain the Cr/Fe and
Mn/Fe (and possibly Ni/Fe) ratios. The number ratio of CCSNe to
the total SNe contributing to the enrichment is 80 per cent with the
latest N20 model and 90 per cent with the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô calculation, con-
sistent with the estimated values in other clusters (e.g., Simionescu
et al. 2015). None the less, the low Ne/Fe and Mg/Fe ratios and
the high Ni/Fe ratio are not reproduced satisfactorily by our linear
combination models of each SN population.

1.7 solar with RGS)
in the cool core with the calculated values in stellar winds from
AGB stars. We Ô¨Ånd that the observed N/O ratio is consistent with
the values expected in winds from AGBs with a low initial mass
(
). The derived Mg abundance around NGC 4696 is compa-
‚àº
rable to the stellar metallicity observed in early-type galaxies with
optical observations (Kobayashi & Arimoto 1999; Kuntschner et al.
2010). These results for the abundance of lighter elements imply the
gas expelled by stellar mass loss is dominant around NGC 4696. The
ICM mass within the central 120 arcsec core can be reproduced over
the last 9‚Äì10 Gyr enrichment time of stellar mass loss, assuming a
star formation at ùëß = 2‚Äì3. Adopting the power-law delay-time dis-
tribution of SNIa rate and accumulating it over the past 9‚Äì10 Gyr,
the present SNIa rate required to reproduce the central Fe mass is
0.11 SNIa (100 yr 1010 Lùêµ,
1. This value is marginally consistent
with the rate reported by optical observations (e.g., Li et al. 2011).

This study also shows that the high-resolution spectroscopy is im-
portant to measure the metal abundances and to reveal the chemical

enrichment in the cooler innermost region of clusters. Future mis-
sions are crucial to obtain a more precise picture of the chemical
enrichment and evolutionary history of clusters of galaxies with ro-
bust constraints on element abundances especially of Fe-peak and
trace odd-ùëç elements.
