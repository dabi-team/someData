Abstract. Towards the end of LHC Run1, gas leaks were observed in some parts of the
Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) of ATLAS. Due to these leaks, primary Xenon based gas
mixture was replaced with Argon based mixture in various parts. Test-beam studies with a
dedicated Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) prototype were carried out in 2015 in order to
understand transition radiation performance with mixtures based on Argon and Krypton. We
present and discuss the results of these test-beam studies with diﬀerent active gas compositions.

1. Introduction
TRT is the outermost part of the ATLAS Inner Detector. It is a gaseous tracker system consisting
of 300 000 small diameter(4 mm) drift tubes called straws. Along with its tracking capability
TRT also helps Particle Identiﬁcation (PID) by measuring transition radiation. TRT compares
signals from the straws with two diﬀerent thresholds; one being low the other being high. When
the deposited energy results in a signal which is over the high level treashold in the straw, it is
considered as a HL hit. HL hits indicate the transition radiation.

Transition radiation occurs when a highly relativistic charged particle crosses the boundary
between media with diﬀerent dielectric properties. The radiated energy with transition
radiation(TR) is roughly proportional to Lorentz factor (γ). The spectrum hardens as the
particle velocity increases [1]. As a result HL hit probability changes with the Lorentz
factor(Figure 1). Since their γ is diﬀerent, HL fraction on the track for electrons and pions

with the same momentum diﬀers as shown in Figure 2. Therefore PID depends on threshold
setting and the detecting medium.

Due to some unforeseeable eﬀects cracks developed in the TRT gas pipes and some of the
damage was impossible to repair. Hence in Run 2, Argon based gas mixture was used in critically
eﬀected parts instead of the Xenon based gas mixture. This aﬀected the PID performance since
Argon TR capture eﬃciency is signiﬁcantly lower.

In this study, we examine the TR detection performance the transition radiation detector
(TRD) prototype ﬁlled with diﬀerent gas mixtures based on Xenon , Krypton, and Argon.The
results of some other studies performed with the TRD prototype can be also found in [2], [3]
presented at this Conference.

2. Motivation Of The Study With Krypton Gas Mixture
The TR spectrum is roughly from 4 keV to 20 keV and in this energy range the Xenon absorption
crossection is higher than Argon and Krypton for photons upto 14keV. After 14keV Krypton
K-shell contribution to crossection decreases the absorption lenght value for Krypton to lower
level than the rest (Figure3). When a 14 keV photon iteracts with Krypton atom, there is 65%
probability that a 12 keV escape photon is emmited. Yet there is roughly 2 keV energy left
in the straw and combined with the energy deposited by the particle itself (dE/dx) which all
together contributes to the energy range where TR expected.

As a result the Krypton mixture(after threshold optimization) seems to be a good candidate

for PID purposes.

The 2015 TRT test beam was held at CERN (SPS north area H8) during 26th May - 1 st June.
The main aim of the eﬀort was to asses the TR photon capture performance of the Krypton
based gas mixture. A transition radiation detector (TRD) made out of TRT straws was used
with radiators similar to radiator materials used in TRT. In Figure 4, circles represent the
straws ande the rectangles represent the radiators infront of the straws. The two scintillators
each about the size of the beam proﬁle (Sc1,Sc2) were used for triggering; their coincidence was
the trigger condition.

Electron-pion mixed beams of 20 GeV were used during the test beam study. There were
two beam conﬁgurations; one being the electron-rich conﬁguration and the other being pion-
rich conﬁguration. Measurement with Xenon, Argon and Krypton based gas mixtures were
performed with roughly 70% noble gas, 27% CO2, 3% O2 composition. Standart Fe55 calibration
was done for each straws. Gas gain controlled with an accuracy of about 2%. Diﬀerent radiators
and arrangements such as ﬁbre and foil (Polypropylene) radiators as well as radiator-absent case
were set up during data taking.

TRT Test Beam setup.

4. Particle Identiﬁcation
Most of the data taking was with electron-rich beams however we had few pion-rich runs as well.
The lead-glass and preshower detectors were used to identify pions and electrons. The lack of
diﬀerent-composition runs beyond the two types mentioned above overrules the possibility of a
quantitative study of the beam composition in an attempt to determine the amount of possible
contamination from other particles, such as protons and kaons. If these contaminations were of
a signiﬁcant level, we would expect to see the tail of a decaying function underneath the sharp
electron peaks in the leadglass calorimeter QDC count histograms. (Figures 5&6)

The identiﬁcation selection criteria are as follows;

• Particles with the leadglass QDC values between 2000-2500 and preshower QDC values

between 400-3500 are considered as electrons.

• Particles with the leadglass QDC values between 0-1500 and preshower QDC values between

200-300 are considered as pions.

Particle selection purity with this selection is around 10−3.

5. Diﬀerential and Integral Spectrums for Xe, Ar, Kr
For the diﬀerential spectrum histograms we applied a scaling factor to match the low energy
parts hence to make an easier comparision(Figures 7,8,9). ﬁlled with energy deposited to straw
and to make an easy comparison we changed the scaling factor so that the low energy parts
of the histograms coincide. By looking at the resulting diﬀerential spectrum comparison plots
we can infer where TR spectrum starts. A direct observation from these histograms is that the
Krypton spectrum slowly varies where Xenon and Argon has small bumps. This might be the
result of the remaining energy left after a 12 keV escape photon emmited.

To investigate various HL thereshold values, we produced integral spectrum plots(Xenon
example Figure 10) by dividing integral result for region after the threshold to total integral

for each threshold value. These plots give rejection powers for a speciﬁc threshold value. For
example, if we set a 6 keV threshold for a single straw ﬁlled with Xenon,it would produce HL
hit 26% of the time for 20 GeV electrons however 4% of the time for pions.

Results
The probability to exceed threshold for electron vs pion plots were produced for diﬀerent gas
and radiator combinations. These plots clearly veriﬁy that Krypton performs better than Argon
but worse than Xenon in all interesting pion rejection powers.

Figure 12 we can easily make a good estimate of the particle separation of the detectors with
the setup used in the test beam. These results are for single straw and using these results one
can estimate the pion and electron seperation power for the case of multiple straw layers.

The estimated number of straw hits on the particle trajectory can be used to produce binomial
distribution along with the probability to exceed threshold for electron and pion values denoted
in the Figure 12. The resulting distribution will give an seperation estimation.

7. Conclusion
The analysis performed to obtain HL threshold probability plots will allow us to determine the
operating point for TRT straws with alternate gas mixtures. The actual decision for the choice
of such operating points require a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the TRD.

Although the eﬀect of larger Kr cross section for photon energies greater than 14 keV is
not strongly pronounced it’s eﬀect on the particle separation it is still quite good. Hence,
optimization of the detector geometry for Kr mixture could signiﬁcantly improve its PID
performance.
