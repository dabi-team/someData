ABSTRACT

Context. Coronal dimmings are regions of decreased extreme-ultravoilet (EUV) and/or X-ray (originally Skylab, then Yohkoh/SXT)
intensities, which are often associated with ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The large-scale, impulsive dimmings have
substantially been observed and investigated. The pre-ﬂare dimmings prior to the ﬂare impulsive phase, however, have rarely been
studied in detail.
Aims. In this paper, we focus on the pre-ﬂare coronal dimmings. We report our multiwavelength observations of the GOES X1.6 solar
ﬂare and the accompanying halo CME produced by the eruption of a sigmoidal magnetic ﬂux rope (MFR) in NOAA active region
(AR) 12158 on 2014 September 10.
Methods. The eruption was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO).
The photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms were observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard SDO. The soft
X-ray (SXR) ﬂuxes were recorded by the GOES spacecraft. The halo CME was observed by the white light coronagraphs of the Large
Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO) aboard SOHO.
Results. About 96 minutes before the onset of ﬂare/CME, narrow pre-ﬂare coronal dimmings appeared at the two ends of the twisted
MFR. They extended very slowly with their intensities decreasing with time, while their apparent widths (8−9 Mm) nearly kept
constant. During the impulsive and decay phases of ﬂare, typical fanlike twin dimmings appeared and expanded with much larger
extent and lower intensities than the pre-ﬂare dimmings. The percentage of 171 Å intensity decrease reaches 40%. The pre-ﬂare
dimmings are most striking in 171, 193, and 211 Å with formation temperatures of 0.6−2.5 MK. The northern part of the pre-ﬂare
dimmings could also be recognized in 131 and 335 Å.
Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst detailed study of pre-ﬂare coronal dimmings, which can be explained by the density
depletion as a result of the gradual expansion of the coronal loop system surrounding the MFR during the slow rise of the MFR.

1. Introduction

Flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most violent
processes of energy release in the solar atmosphere and the most
important sources of space weather (Forbes et al. 2006; Chen
2011; Hudson 2011; Fletcher et al. 2011). Sometimes, the pre-
ﬂare phase, rise phase, and decay phase of ﬂares are temporally
related to the initial phase, impulsive acceleration phase, and
propagation phase of CMEs, respectively (Zhang et al. 2001).
Both of the phenomena are often associated with the erup-
tions of ﬁlaments (Zhang et al. 2015, 2016), which are sus-
pended by magnetic sheared arcades or magnetic ﬂux ropes
(MFRs) along the polarity inversion lines (Titov & Démoulin
1999; Aulanier et al. 2010; Xia et al. 2014; Su et al. 2015). An
MFR consists of a set of magnetic ﬁeld lines wrapping around
its central axis and appears as a hot channel with tempera-
ture as high as 10 MK in the low corona (Zhang et al. 2012a).
The large-scale eruptions usually create global disturbances
propagating very long distances on the solar surface. For the
ﬁrst time, Thompson et al. (1998) observed dimming regions
and bright wavefronts with enhanced intensities that propa-
gate quasi-radially from the source region of a CME. The on-
set of dimming is consistent with the initiation of the wave-
front, i.e., coronal wave or extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave

(Chen et al. 2002; Patsourakos & Vourlidas 2012). The decrease
of the intensity of dimming region is due to a decrease in plasma
density rather than in temperature (Harrison & Lyons 2000).
The percentage of density decrease could reach 35%−40%
(Jin et al. 2009). The temperatures of the EUV dimmings are
1−4 MK (Zhukov & Auchère 2004; Robbrecht & Wang 2010;
Cheng et al. 2012a). Thompson et al. (2000) identiﬁed transient
dimming regions with strong EUV emission depletion around
the eruption, and the dimming areas are cospatial with the foot-
prints of CMEs (Bewsher et al. 2008; Attrill et al. 2010). As the
CME proceeds, the EUV wave propagates outwards at speed
of 50−1500 km s−1 and the area of trailing dimming increases,
covering a signiﬁcant fraction of the solar surface (Harra et al.
2007; Thompson & Myers 2009; Attrill & Wills-Davey 2010;
Cheng et al. 2012b). Recent quadrature observations have re-
vealed the dome-shaped nature of EUV waves and dimming re-
gions (Patsourakos et al. 2009; Veronig et al. 2010). There is a
special kind of dimmings that appear near the two ends of a pre-
ﬂare, S-shaped sigmoid at the beginning of the impulsive accel-
eration phase of CMEs (Miklenic et al. 2011). Such twin dim-
mings, following the eruption of a twisted MFR, can also persist
for tens of hours to more than three days (Sterling & Hudson
1997; Kahler & Hudson 2001). The decrease of twin dimming
intensity is correlated with the increase of ﬂaring arcade inten-

sity in EUV wavelengths (Zarro et al. 1999). Interestingly, twin
dimming regions are found to rotate around the center of the
ﬂare site due to rotation of the erupting ﬁlament (Miklenic et al.
2011). Similar to typical coronal dimmings that have a circular
or elliptical shape, twin dimmings also originate from density
depletion as a result of magnetic ﬁeld line stretching or reconﬁg-
uration associated with CMEs. Spectroscopic observations from
space telescopes have revealed strong plasma upﬂows at speeds
of tens to hundreds of km s−1 in the coronal dimming regions
(e.g., Harra & Sterling 2001; Dolla & Zhukov 2011). The grad-
ual recovery of dimming regions lasts for a long time by re-
establishment of the bright coronal loops (Reinard & Biesecker
2008; Attrill et al. 2010). Sophisticated numerical simulations
have also improved our understandings of coronal waves and
dimmings. Imada et al. (2007) discovered that the velocities
(16−160 km s−1) of upﬂow in the dimming region depend on the
formation temperatures of the emission lines, i.e., hotter lines
show faster upﬂow velocities. Imada et al. (2011) found that the
temperature-dependent upﬂow in the dimming region can be
well modeled by quasi-steady ﬂow in a vertical ﬂux tube whose
cross section expands super-radially with height from the solar
surface.

Since the launch of Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO),
coronal dimmings following CMEs have been extensively in-
vestigated (Liu & Ofman 2014; Warmuth 2015, and references
therein). However, the pre-ﬂare or pre-eruption dimmings have
rarely been reported. Cheng & Qiu (2016) studied the coronal
dimmings on 2011 December 26 in detail and found that the
rapid dimmings started after the onset of fast magnetic recon-
nection and CME acceleration. At the end of the paper, they
mentioned that, at some locations, the gradual dimmming started
about 30 minutes before the CME eruption and impulsive ﬂare
reconnection. The authors proposed that the gradual and weak
pre-eruption dimming may reﬂect the slow expansion of coro-
nal structures. In this paper, we report long-term EUV dim-
mings prior to the onset of ﬂare and CME observed by the At-
mospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) aboard
SDO. On 2014 September 10, an inverse-S, sigmoidal MFR
formed in NOAA active region (AR) 12158 close to the disk cen-
ter. At ∼17:21 UT, the MFR erupted and produced a GOES X1.6
ﬂare that peaked at ∼17:45 UT and a full halo CME that prop-
agated towards the earth (Li et al. 2015a,b; Li & Zhang 2015;
Cheng et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2016; Dudík et al. 2016). The rest
of this paper is structured as follows. Data analysis is described
in Sect. 2, and the results are shown in Sect. 3. Discussion about
the nature and signiﬁcance of pre-ﬂare dimmings are presented
in Sect. 4. Finally, we give a summary of the results in Sect. 5.

2. Data analysis

The eruption was clearly observed by AIA, which has seven
EUV ﬁlters (94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, and 335 Å) with a
cadence of 12 s and two UV ﬁlters (1600 and 1700 Å) with a
cadence of 24 s. Line of sight (LOS) magnetograms from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012)
aboard SDO with a cadence of 45 s were used for studying the
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld of the AR. The full-disk EUV im-
ages and magnetograms have spatial resolutions of 1′′. 2 and 1′′,
respectively. The AIA and HMI level_1 ﬁts data were calibrated
using the standard Solar Software (SSW) programs aia_prep.pro
and hmi_prep.pro. The fast halo CME1 at a linear speed of 1267

graphs of the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph (LASCO;
Brueckner et al. 1995) aboard SOHO. The LASCO/C2 images
were calibrated using the SSW program c2_calibrate.pro. The
high-cadence (2.047 s) SXR ﬂuxes of the ﬂare were recorded by
GOES.

3. Results

In Fig. 1, panel (a) shows the 171 Å image at 15:30:11 UT prior
to the onset of ﬂare. The AR 12158 is enclosed by the white
dashed box (550′′×550′′). Panel (b) shows the 94 Å image at
15:30:01 UT with much higher formation temperature (∼6 MK).
The image features the bright, inverse-S, sigmoidal MFR em-
bedded in the core of AR (Cheng et al. 2015). The photospheric
LOS magnetogram observed by HMI at 15:30:35 UT is dis-
played in panel (c). The AR was associated with a complex βγδ
sunspot. The contours (±400, ±800, and ±1200 G) of the photo-
spheric LOS magnetic ﬁeld of the positive and negative polari-
ties are overlaid on the 171 Å image with blue and green lines,
respectively. It is clear that the MFR resides between the positive
and negative polarities.

In Fig. 2, the GOES SXR light curves in 0.5−4.0 Å and 1−8
Å are plotted in panel (a) with dashed and solid lines. The SXR
ﬂuxes increase gradually from ∼15:45 UT and rise rapidly dur-
ing the impulsive phase of the ﬂare before decreasing slowly dur-
ing the long decay phase (Li et al. 2015a). We also calculated
the integrated, base-diﬀerence EUV intensities of the whole AR
within the white box of Fig. 1(a). The temporal evolutions of
the normalized intensities during 15:30−18:30 UT are depicted
with colored lines in Fig. 2(b). It is clear that the total EUV inten-
sities of the AR increase very slowly during the pre-ﬂare phase
(15:45−17:21 UT), which is similar to the SXR light curves. The
slow rises of both SXR and EUV ﬂuxes of the AR suggest that
plasma heating as a result of the release of magnetic free energy
is already taking place, presumably via magnetic reconnection
(Cheng et al. 2015). The early heating is also supported by the
fact that the 94 and 131 Å light curves with higher peak forma-
tion temperatures do not start increasing until later.

In Fig. 1(b), we draw a vertical slice (S1), which originates
from the ﬂare site with a length of 112 Mm. The temporal evolu-
tions of the intensities along S1 in four of the AIA ﬁlters during
15:30−18:30 UT are displayed as time-slice diagrams in Fig. 3.
It is clear that the coronal loops are undergoing slow rise and

strate ﬁve snapshots of the base-diﬀerence images in 171 Å. It
is clear that narrow dimming regions appeared at the northern
and southern ends of the MFR before ﬂare, which are denoted
by “pre-ﬂare dimming" in panels (a) and (b). As time goes on,
the pre-ﬂare dimmings extended, especially for the northern part
in panel (b). During the impulsive phase of ﬂare when the MFR
erupted out of the corona, two bright ribbons showed up in the
171 Å and 1600 Å images (see panels (c) and (f)). Meanwhile,
the areas of dimming regions expand rapidly with their inten-
sities decreasing to a great extent, forming the typical fanlike
“twin dimming" indicated in panels (d) and (e). The lack of
bright loops nearby in the base-diﬀerence images suggests that
this is most likely a density depletion. During the decay phase of
ﬂare, the dimmings sustained and extended very slowly. In panel
(e), the 94 Å intensity contours are superposed on the 171 Å im-
age with red lines. It is evident that both the pre-ﬂare dimmings
and twin dimmings originated at the two ends of the sigmoid.
This is consistent with the ﬁnding that the observed coronal dim-
mings are located around the footpoints of a erupting ﬂux rope
(Su et al. 2011).

To illustrate the temporal evolution of the dimmings more
clearly, we selected a curved slice (S0 with dashed green line)
that passes through the core of AR and dimming regions in
Fig. 5(e). The total length of S0 is 327.5 Mm. The evolutions
of the base-diﬀerence intensities in 171, 193, and 211 Å along
S0 are displayed as time-slice diagrams in the top panels of
Fig. 6. Both the pre-ﬂare dimmings and twin dimmings are dis-
tinct as dark regions in the diagrams, especially in 171 Å, indi-
cating that the plasma dominantly involved in the dimmings was
in the range of 0.6−2.5 MK. The pre-ﬂare dimmings started at
∼15:45 UT and lasted for ∼96 minutes until the beginning of
the ﬂare impulsive phase at ∼17:21 UT. Afterwards, twin dim-
mings showed up and expanded rapidly with much larger ex-
tent and lower intensities. The percentage of intensity decrease
is ∼40%. It is noticed that the northern part of the pre-ﬂare dim-
mings was always more striking and evident than the southern
part, while the southern part of the twin dimmings was always
stronger than the northern part during the ﬂare. The evolutions
of the base-diﬀerence intensities in 94, 131, and 335 Å along
S0 are displayed as time-slice diagrams in the bottom panels of
Fig. 6. Only the northern part of the pre-ﬂare dimmings could
be identiﬁed with slightly lower magnitudes than those in the
cooler ﬁlters, while the southern part is hardly visible in these
wavelengths.

To compare the pre-ﬂare dimming regions with the whole
AR, we selected two representative positions (D1 and D2) in the
pre-ﬂare dimming regions, which are labeled with small circles
in Fig. 5(b). The temporal evolutions of the base-diﬀerence in-

expansion during the mild heating of the AR before the onset of
ﬂare, especially in 193 and 211 Å.

The halo CME appeared and expanded isotropically in the
ﬁeld-of-view of LASCO/C2 during 18:00−18:36 UT. In Fig. 4,
the base-diﬀerence WL image of the CME at ∼18:12 UT is dis-
played in the left panel. The height-time proﬁle of the CME is
plotted in the right panel with diamonds. The result of least-
square ﬁtting of the proﬁle is overlaid with a dashed line. The
extrapolated initiation time of CME coincided with the onset of
ﬂare at ∼17:21 UT.

Taking the EUV images at ∼15:30 UT as base images, we
obtained the subsequent base-diﬀerence images until 18:30 UT
(see the online movie ﬂare.avi). In Fig. 5, panels (a)-(e) demon-

ejection of emitting plasma with temperatures of several MK
(Harrison & Lyons 2000), thermal dimmings because diﬀerent
EUV ﬁlters have diﬀerent formation temperatures (Cheng et al.
2011) and Doppler dimming, to name a few. In our study, the
large-scale twin dimmings followed the pre-ﬂare dimmings. It
has been widely accepted that the twin dimmings originate
from the density depletion as a result of eruption of an MFR
(Su et al. 2011). Before the ﬂare impulsive phase, there was
no clear signature of mass loss. The pre-ﬂare dimmings result
from density depletion when the whole coronal loop system sur-
rounding the MFR undergoes gradual volume expansion dur-
ing the slow rise of the MFR. Such a precursor expansion in
this event has also been noticed by Dudík et al. (2016). As il-
lustrated in the schematic cartoon of Cheng et al. (2015), the
tether-cutting magnetic reconnection occurred during the pre-
ﬂare phase (Moore et al. 2001), which has two eﬀects. One
is the mild heating of the MFR residing in the core of AR
(see Fig. 2(a)). The other is the decrease of constrain on the
MFR from the envelop magnetic ﬁeld as well as the increase of
poloidal magnetic ﬂux of the MFR at the same time, leading to
the slow rise of the MFR (Sterling & Moore 2005; Chifor et al.
2007; Sterling et al. 2011). This is usually accompanied by grad-
ual volume expansion since the magnetic ﬁeld and electron num-
ber density decrease with height in the low-β corona.

Considering that both pre-ﬂare dimmings and twin dim-
mings are clearly demonstrated in the base-diﬀerence images,
there is a concern that the pre-ﬂare dimmings are artifact of the
base-diﬀerence image processing. To dispel this doubt, we make
time-slice diagram of S0 using the original images in 171 Å in-
stead of the base-diﬀerence images. It is obvious from Fig. 7
that both pre-ﬂare dimmings and twin dimmings are distinguish-
able as dark regions. The locations and time of the dimmings
are the same as those in Fig. 6(a). Therefore, the pre-dimmings
are real and convincing, not artifact of the base-diﬀerence image
processing.

Another concern is that the pre-ﬂare dimmings might result
from the transverse shifts of the bright, adjacent coronal loops
before its impulsive eruption of the MFR. To test this conjec-
ture, we selected two short, straight slices (S2 and S3 with solid
blue lines) that cross the northern and southern parts of dimming
regions in Fig. 5(e). The total lengths of S2 and S3 are 70.6
and 57.3 Mm. The evolutions of the base-diﬀerence intensities
in 171 Å along S2 and S3 are displayed as time-slice diagrams
in the left and right panels of Fig. 8. Note that the time axis and
distance axis are diﬀerent from those of Fig. 6. Starting from
∼15:45 UT, the northern part of pre-ﬂare dimmings decreases in
intensity, with its apparent width (∼8.3 Mm) nearly keeping con-
stant. After the onset of ﬂare, the northern part of twin dimmings
expanded rapidly to a much broader extent with lower intensity
(see panel (a)). Similar to the northern part, the southern part
of pre-ﬂare dimmings decreases in intensity with the apparent
width (∼9.5 Mm) keeping constant before the appearance of the
southern part of twin dimmings (see panel (b)). There is no clear
signature of coronal loop shifts in the transverse directions be-
fore the impulsive phase of ﬂare.

4.2. The signiﬁcance of pre-ﬂare dimmings

Although it is not easy to predict when a ﬁlament (ﬂux rope)
erupts, which potentially leads to a ﬂare and/or a CME, there are
precursor activities a few to tens of minutes before the eruptions,
such as initial heating and brightenings as a result of magnetic
reconnection (Sterling & Moore 2005; Joshi et al. 2011), strong

nal dimmings. The intensity contours of the 94 Å image in Fig. 1(b) are

pre-ﬂare dimmings and twin dimmings are pointed by the white arrows
in each panel.

tensities of D1 and D2 in 171 Å are displayed in Fig. 2(c) with
solid and dashed lines, respectively. It is obvious that the inten-
sities of D1 and D2 decrease gradually from ∼15:45 UT until
17:27 and 17:30 UT, respectively.

4. Discussion

4.1. The nature of pre-ﬂare dimmings

Despite of extensive observations and investigations in the past,
the origins of coronal dimmings are not completely under-
stood. Mason et al. (2014) summarized the mechanisms of coro-
nal dimmings, including the mass-loss dimmings as a result of

mings are pointed by the black arrows in each panel. The white double-
headed arrows denote the apparent widths of the pre-ﬂare dimmings
along S2 and S3.

2. The pre-ﬂare dimmings are observed by SDO/AIA mainly in
171, 193, and 211 Å with formation temperatures of 0.6−2.5
MK. The northern part of pre-ﬂare dimmings could be iden-
tiﬁed in 131 and 335 Å with higher formation temperatures.
3. During the impulsive and decay phases of ﬂare, typical fan-
like twin dimmings appeared and expanded with much larger
extent and lower intensities than the pre-ﬂare dimmings. The
percentage of 171 Å intensity decrease reaches ∼40%. It is
likely that the pre-ﬂare dimmings are progenitor of the large-
scale twin dimmings.

4. We conclude that the pre-ﬂare dimmings originate from den-
sity depletion as a result of the gradual expansion of the coro-
nal loop system surrounding the MFR during the slow rise
of the MFR. Our ﬁndings provide strong supports for the
conjecture of Cheng & Qiu (2016) and have potential signif-
icance to space weather prediction.

ﬂare as well as the initiation of the halo CME, which can be con-
sidered as another precursor of solar eruptions. Additional case
studies and statistical works using multiwavelength observations
are worthwhile to investigate the nature of pre-ﬂare coronal dim-
mings. If the proposal is consolidated, it will be undoubtedly
valuable for the space weather prediction.

5. Summary

In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the
ﬂare/CME event that occurred in AR 12158 as a result of erup-
tion of an MFR on 2014 September 10, focusing on the study of
pre-ﬂare coronal dimmings. The main results are summarized as
follows:

1. The pre-ﬂare dimmings appeared at the two ends of the
twisted MFR and lasted for ∼96 minutes until the onset of
ﬂare and initiation of the halo CME. The narrow pre-ﬂare
dimmings extended very slowly with their intensities de-
creasing with time. Their apparent widths (8−9 Mm), how-
ever, did not change a lot.
