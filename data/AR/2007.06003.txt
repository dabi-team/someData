Abstract

A subgraph of an edge-colored graph is rainbow, if all of its edges have diﬀerent
colors. For a graph G and a family H of graphs, the anti-Ramsey number ar(G, H)
is the maximum number k such that there exists an edge-coloring of G with exactly
k colors without rainbow copy of any graph in H.
In this paper, we study the
anti-Ramsey number of C3 and C4 in the complete r-partite graphs. For r ≥ 3 and
n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 1, we determine ar(Kn1,n2,...,nr , {C3, C4}), ar(Kn1,n2,...,nr , C3)
and ar(Kn1,n2,...,nr , C4).

Keywords: Anti-Ramsey numbers, complete r-partite graphs, cycles.

1. Introduction

We call a subgraph of an edge-colored graph rainbow, if all the edges have diﬀerent
colors. For a graph G and a family H of graphs, the anti-Ramsey number ar(G, H) is the
maximum number k such that there exists an edge-coloring of G with exactly k colors
without rainbow copy of any graph in H. If H = {H}, then we denote ar(G, {H}) by
ar(G, H). The study of anti-Ramsey theory was initiated by Erd˝os, Simonovits and S´os
[6] and considered in the classical case when G = Kn. Since then plentiful results were
established for a variety of graphs H, including among cycles [1, 17], cliques [6, 18, 20],
trees [12, 14], and non-connected graphs [8, 21]. Also, diﬀerent graphs were considered
as the underlying host graph G, including complete bipartite graphs [3], complete hyper-
graphs [10, 19], complete split graphs [9, 15], triangulations [4, 16]. See Fujita, Magnant,
and Ozeki [7] for a survey.

For cycles, Erd˝os, Simonovits and S´os [6] showed that ar(Kn, C3) = n − 1 and con-
jectured that ar(Kn, Ck) = ( k−2
k−1)n + O(1), for all n ≥ k ≥ 3. Alon [1] proved
− 1. Jiang, Schiermeyer and West [13]
it for k = 4 by showing that ar(Kn, C4) =
proved this conjecture for k ≤ 7. Finally, Montellano-Ballesteros and Neumann-Lara [17]
(cid:4)
completely proved this conjecture.

A complete split graph Kn + Ks is a join of a complete graph Kn and an empty graph
Ks, that is the graph obtained from Kn ∪Ks by joining each vertex of Kn with each vertex
of Ks. Gorgol [9] considered the cycles in complete split graphs and proved the following
result.

Theorem 3. ([9]) For n ≥ 2, s ≥ 1, ar(Kn + Ks, C3) = n + s − 1.

They also gave a lower bound and an upper bound for ar(Kn+Ks, C4) and conjectured

that the exact value is closer to the lower bound.

In section 2, we study the anti-Ramsey number of {C3, C4} and C3 in the complete

r-partite graphs and prove the following two theorems.

Theorem 5. For r ≥ 3 and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 1, we have

ar(Kn1,n2,...,nr , {C3, C4}) = n1 + n2 + · · · + nr − 1.

In section 3, we generalize the theorem of Alon [1] to complete r-partite graphs. We

call two subgraphs H1 and H2 of G are independent if they are vertex disjoint.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will give the proof of Theorem 5
and Theorem 6. In Section 3, we will prove Theorem 7. Finally we will give some open
problems in Section 4.

(cid:5)

Notations: Let G be a simple undirected graph. For x ∈ V (G), we denote the
neighborhood and the degree of x in G by NG(x) and dG(x), respectively. The maximum
degree of G is denoted by ∆(G). We will use G − x to denote the graph that arises
from G by deleting the vertex x ∈ V (G). For ∅ 6= X ⊂ V (G), G[X] is the subgraph
of G induced by X and G − X is the subgraph of G induced by V (G) \ X. Given
a graph G = (V, E), for any (not necessarily disjoint) vertex sets A, B ⊂ V , we let
EG(A, B) = {uv ∈ E(G) : u 6= v, u ∈ A, v ∈ B}. A vertex v of a graph G is called a
cut vertex if the components number of G − x is bigger than G. A block of a graph is
a subgraph which is connected, has no cut vertex and is maximal with respect to this
property.

Given an edge-coloring c of G, we denote the color of an edge uv by c(uv). A color a
is starred (at x) if all the edges with color a induce a star K1,r (centered at the vertex x).
Note that the two vertices of K1,1 can be regarded as the center of K1,1, if a color a is stared
at both x and y, then xy is the unique edge with color a. We let dc(v) = |{a ∈ C(v) : a

3

is starred at v}|. For a subgraph H of G, we denote C(H) = {c(uv) : uv ∈ E(H)}. A
representing subgraph in an edge-coloring of Kn is a spanning subgraph containing exactly
one edge of each color.

2. 3-cycle

In this section, we will prove Theorem 5 and Theorem 6. We recall the proof of
ar(Kn, C3) = n − 1 in [6] because we will use the idea of it later. Let V (Kn) =
{v1, v2, . . . , vn}. For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, we color edge vivj with color i.
In such a way,
we use exactly n − 1 colors and there is no rainbow C3. On the other hand, for any
n-edge-coloring of Kn, we take a representing subgraph G, then G contains a rainbow
cycle since |E(G)| = n. By adding one chord to the cycle, we get two shorter cycles and
at least one of them is rainbow. Do the same operation on the shorter rainbow cycle.
Finally, we will ﬁnd a rainbow C3. To generalize the idea of the proof, we ﬁrst give the
following useful deﬁnition and lemma.

Deﬁnition 1. Let r ≥ 3 and G be an r-partite graph with parts V1, V2, . . . , Vr, we call a
subgraph H of G multipartite, if there are at least three distinct parts Vi, Vj, Vk such that
V (H) ∩ Vi 6= ∅, V (H) ∩ Vj 6= ∅ and V (H) ∩ Vk 6= ∅.

Lemma 1. Let r ≥ 3 and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 1. For an edge-coloring of Kn1,n2,...,nr, if
there is a rainbow multipartite cycle, then there is a rainbow C3.

Proof. Since for any multipartite cycle C of length at least 4, there is a chord e of C such
that C ∪ e contains two multipartite cycles C 1 and C 2, where E(C 1) ∩ E(C 2) = {e} and
E(C 1) ∪ E(C 2) = E(C) ∪ {e}. Thus for any rainbow multipartite cycle of length at least
4, we can ﬁnd a shorter rainbow multipartite cycle. Do the same operation on the shorter
rainbow multipartite cycle. Finally, we will ﬁnd a rainbow C3.

We determine the anti-Ramsey number of {C3, C4} in the complete r-partite graphs

as follows.
Theorem 5. For r ≥ 3 and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 1, we have

ar(Kn1,n2,...,nr , {C3, C4}) = n1 + n2 + · · · + nr − 1.

Proof. Lower bound: Let n = n1 + n2 + · · · + nr. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ r, we take a vertex
ui from Vi. Let U = {u1, u2, . . . , ur} and V \ U = {ur+1, ur+2, . . . , un}. Note that for all
1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, there is at least one edge between ui+1 and {uj : 1 ≤ j ≤ i} in Kn1,n2,...,nr.
For 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, we color all the edges between ui+1 and {uj : 1 ≤ j ≤ i} by color i. In
such a way, we use exactly n − 1 colors, and there is no rainbow C3 or C4.

Upper bound: For an (n1 + n2 + · · · + nr)-edge-coloring of Kn1,n2,...,nr, we take a
representing subgraph G. Since |E(G)| = n1 + n2 + · · · + nr = |V (G)|, we can ﬁnd a

4

cycle C of G and C is rainbow. If C is multipartite, there is a rainbow C3 by Lemma
If C is not multipartite, then there exist i and j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ r, such that
1.
V (C) ⊂ Vi ∪ Vj and |V (C) ∩ Vi| = |V (C) ∩ Vj|. If the length of C is at least 6, for a
chord e of C, C ∪ e contains two even cycles C 1 and C 2, where E(C 1) ∩ E(C 2) = {e}
and E(C 1) ∪ E(C 2) = E(C) ∪ {e}. Since C is rainbow, we claim that at least one of C 1
and C 2 is a rainbow even cycle. Thus, we ﬁnd a rainbow shorter even cycle. Do the same
operation on the shorter rainbow even cycle. Finally, we can ﬁnd a rainbow C4.

Now we will determine the maximum number of edges in an r-partite graphs without

multipartite cycles by the following lemmas.

Lemma 2. For r ≥ 3 and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 1, if G ⊂ Kn1,n2,...,nr and G contains no
multipartite P3, then

|E(G)| ≤

n1n2 + n3n4 + · · · + nr−2nr−1,
n1n2 + n3n4 + · · · + nr−1nr,

(

r is odd;

r is even.

Proof. We will prove it by induction on r. It is obvious to see that the conclusion holds
for the base cases r = 1 and r = 2. Assume that it holds for all integers less than r, and
let G ⊂ Kn1,n2,...,nr which contains no multipartite P3. For any vertex v, there is some
part Vi such that NG(v) ⊂ Vi. Choose v1 ∈ V1 such that dG(v1) = max{dG(v) : v ∈ V1}.
Suppose NG(v1) ⊂ Vi0, where 2 ≤ i0 ≤ r. For every vertex v ∈ V1 \ {v1}, we delete all the
edges incident with v in G and connect all the edges between v and NG(v1). For every
vertex u ∈ Vi0 \ NG(v1), we delete all the edges incident with u in G and connect all the
edges between u and V1. Denote the graph we obtained by G1, we have |E(G)| ≤ |E(G1)|
and G1 contains no multipartite P3.

If i0 6= 2, we choose v2 ∈ V2 such that dG1(v2) = max{dG1(v) : v ∈ V2}. Suppose
NG1(v2) ⊂ Vj0, where 3 ≤ j0 ≤ r and j0 6= i0. For every vertex v ∈ V2 \ {v2}, we delete
all the edges incident with v in G1 and connect all the edges between v and NG1(v2).
For every vertex u ∈ Vj0 \ NG1(v2), we delete all the edges incident with u in G1 and
connect all the edges between u and V2. Denote the graph we obtained by G2, we have
|E(G1)| ≤ |E(G2)| and G2 contains no multipartite P3. We note that both G2[V1 ∪ Vi0]
and G2[V2 ∪ Vj0] are complete bipartite graphs. We delete all the edges of G2[V1 ∪ Vi0] and
G2[V2 ∪ Vj0], connect all the edges between V1 and V2 and connect all the edges between
Vi0 and Vj0. Denote the graph we obtained by G′, then G′ contains no multipartite P3.
Since n1ni0 + n2nj0 ≤ n1n2 + ni0nj0, we have |E(G2)| ≤ |E(G′)|. If i0 = 2, we denote
G′ = G1.

Lemma 3. Let G ⊂ Kn1,n2,...,nr which contains no multipartite cycle. If P = xyz is a
multipartite P3 of G, then y is a cut vertex of G.

Proof. Suppose y is not a cut vertex of G. Then there is a path P ′ connect x and z in
G − y, thus xP zP ′x is a multipartite cycle of G, a contradiction.

Lemma 4. For r ≥ 3 and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 1, if G ⊂ Kn1,n2,...,nr and G contains no
multipartite cycle, then

|E(G)| ≤

r is odd;

r is even.

Proof. Take a graph G ⊂ Kn1,n2,...,nr such that G contains no multipartite cycle and
|E(G)| is the maximum possible.

Claim 1. G is connected and each block of G is a complete bipartite graph whose

two parts belong to two parts of Kn1,n2,...,nr, respectively.

Proof of Claim 1. If G is not connected, we can add edges between the connected
components of G, such that there is still no multipartite cycle, a contradiction. Let
B be a block of G, if there are three distinct parts Vi, Vj and Vk such that V (B) ∩ Vi 6=
∅, V (B)∩Vj 6= ∅ and V (B)∩Vk 6= ∅, then B contains a multipartite cycle, a contradiction.

For 1 ≤ i ≤ r, we select one vertex xi ∈ Vi and let V ′

i = Vi \ {xi}. Denote V0 =

{x1, x2, . . . , xr}. For each i = 1, 2, . . . , r, perform the following operations sequentially:

If there is a vertex v ∈ V ′

i such that v is a cut vertex of G, and v separate the blocks
B1 and B2, then there is at least one of B1 and B2, we say B1 such that there is no
paths connect xi to NG(v) ∩ V (B1) in G − v. Thus, we delete the edges between v and
NG(v) ∩ V (B1), and connect the edges between xi and NG(v) ∩ V (B1). We still denote
the new graph by G.

Claim 2. In each step, G contains no multipartite cycle and |E(G)| is the same as in
the starting graph. When the above procedure stops, v is not a cut vertex of G for any
vertex v ∈ ∪r

i=1V ′

For r is odd, ﬁrst, we color K[V1 ∪ V2], K[V3 ∪ V4], . . . , K[Vr−2 ∪ Vr−1] rainbow. Second,
for every vertex v ∈ Vr, we color the edges incident v with one new distinct color. Finally,
2 − 1, we color the edges between V2i−1 ∪ V2i and ∪r−1
for 1 ≤ i ≤ r−1

distinct color. In such way, we use exactly n1n2 + n3n4 + · · · + nr−2nr−1 + nr + r−1

j=2i+1Vj with one new
2 − 1 colors, and

for 1 ≤ i ≤ r

there is no rainbow C3.

2 − 1, we color the edges between V2i−1 ∪ V2i and ∪r

Upper bound: For r ≥ 3 and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 1, we denote

f (n1, n2, . . . , nr) =

Given any edge-coloring of Kn1,n2,...,nr with f (n1, n2, . . . , nr) + 1 colors, we take a repre-
senting subgraph G. Notice that G is rainbow and |E(G)| = f (n1, n2, . . . , nr) + 1. By
Lemma 4, G contains a rainbow multipartite cycle. Hence, there is a rainbow C3 by
Lemma 1.

3. 4-cycle

In this section, we study the anti-Ramsey number of C4 in the complete r-partite
graphs. Before doing so, we will determine the maximum number of independent triangles
in the complete r-partite graphs by the following proposition.

Proposition 1. For r ≥ 3 and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 1, let t be the maximum number of
independent triangles of Kn1,n2,...,nr, then we have

j=1V (Tj), where l = n1 + n2 + · · · + nr − 3t. First,
color those triangles rainbow. Second, for 2 ≤ i ≤ t, we color all the edges between
∪i−1
j=1V (Tj) and V (Ti) with one new color. Finally, for 1 ≤ i ≤ l, we color all the edges
between U ∪ {v1, . . . , vi−1} and vi with one new color.
In such way, we use exactly
4t − 1 + l = n1 + n2 + · · · + nr + t − 1 colors, and there is no rainbow copy of C4.

Upper bound: We will prove the upper bound by induction on n = n1 +n2 +· · ·+nr.
The base case n1 = n2 = · · · = nr = 1 is true by Theorem 1. Assume that it holds for
all integers less than n. For an (n + t)-edge coloring c of Kn1,n2,...,nr, suppose there is
no rainbow C4, we have dc(x) ≥ 2 for any vertex x ∈ V (Kn1,n2,...,nr). Otherwise, by the
induction hypothesis, we have

|C(Kn1,n2,...,nr − x)| ≥ n + t − 1 ≥ ar(Kn1,n2,...,nr − x, C4) + 1,

and there is a rainbow C4 in Kn1,n2,...,nr − x, a contradiction.

Claim 1. For any vertex x ∈ V , if c(xy) and c(xz) are two distinct colors which are

starred at x, then y and z are in diﬀerent parts.

Proof of Claim 1. Assume that y and z are in the same part. Since dc(y) ≥ 2, there
is at least one edge yw such that c(yw) is starred at y and c(yw) 6= c(xy). Note that
c(zw) /∈ {c(xy), c(xz), c(yw)}, thus xywzx is a rainbow C4, a contradiction.

Claim 2. For any vertex x ∈ V , if c(xy) is starrted at x, then xy is the unique edge

with color c(xy).

Proof of Claim 2. Assume that xy is not the unique edge with color c(xy), then c(xy)
is not starred at y. Since dc(x) ≥ 2, there is a vertex z such that c(xz) is starred at x and
c(xz) 6= c(xy). By Claim 1, y and z are in diﬀerent parts. Since dc(y) ≥ 2, there are two
vertices w1, w2(6= x) such that c(yw1) and c(yw2) are starred at y and c(yw1) 6= c(yw2). By
Claim 1, w1 and w2 are in diﬀerent parts. Thus, there is at least one of w1 and w2, we say
w1, such that z and w1 are in diﬀerent parts. Note that c(zw1) /∈ {c(xy), c(xz), c(yw1)},
thus xyw1zx is a rainbow C4, a contradiction.
Claim 3. For any vertex x ∈ V , dc(x) = 2.
Proof of Claim 3. Assume that there is a vertex x such that dc(x) ≥ 3, there are
three edges xy, xz and xw such that c(xy), c(xz) and c(xw) are starred at x and distinct.
By Claim 1, y, z and w are in diﬀerent parts. Since dc(y) ≥ 2, there is a vertex u such
that c(yu) is starred at y and x, u are in diﬀerent parts. Also, there is at least one of z and
w, we say z, such that u, z are in diﬀerent parts. Note that c(zu) /∈ {c(xy), c(xz), c(yu)},
thus xyuzx is a rainbow C4, a contradiction.

Consider the spanning subgraph G of Kn1,n2,...,nr such that e ∈ E(G) if and only if e is
the unique edge with color c(e). By Claims 1, 2 and 3, G is 2-regular and each component
of G is a cycle .

Claim 4. For each component Cl = x1x2 · · · xlx1 of G, xi and xi+3 belong to the same
part of Kn1,n2,...,nr (if i + 3 > l, xi+3 means xi+3−l), for all 1 ≤ i ≤ l. Furthermore, t = n
3 .
Proof of Claim 4. Suppose that there exists 1 ≤ i ≤ l such that xi and xi+3 belong
to the distinct parts of Kn1,n2,...,nr , then xixi+1xi+2xi+3xi is a rainbow C4, a contradiction.
Thus l ≡ 0 (mod 3) and Kn1,n2,...,nr [V (Cl)] contains exactly l
3 independent triangles. Since
G is a spanning subgraph of Kn1,n2,...,nr, we have t = n
3 .

Since t = n

3 , the maximum number of independent triangles of Kn1,n2,...,nr − x is n−3
3 ,

for all x ∈ V . Thus, by the induction hypothesis, we have

|C(Kn1,n2,...,nr − x)| = n + t − dc(x) = n + t − 2 = ar(Kn1,n2,...,nr − x, C4) + 1,

and there is a rainbow C4 in Kn1,n2,...,nr − x, a contradiction.

4. Open problems

We notice that the lower bound of Theorem 6 is also the lower bound for odd cycles,
and we would conjecture the lower bound is the exact value when the number of the
vertex of each part is suﬃcient large.

Conjecture 1. For r ≥ 3, k ≥ 1 and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≫ k, we have

ar(Kn1,n2,...,nr, C2k+1) =

n1n2 + n3n4 + · · · + nr−2nr−1 + nr + r−1
n1n2 + n3n4 + · · · + nr−1nr + r

2 − 1,

(

2 − 1,

r is odd;

r is even.

Also, it is interesting to investigate the anti-Ramsey number of even cycles in the

complete r-partite graphs.

Problem 1. For r ≥ 3 and k ≥ 3, determine ar(Kn1,n2,...,nr , C2k).

Finally we give the following conjecture which strengthens Lemma 4.

Conjecture 2. For r ≥ 3 and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ · · · ≥ nr ≥ 1, if G ⊂ Kn1,n2,...,nr and

|E(G)| ≥

n1n2 + n3n4 + · · · + nr−2nr−1 + nr + r−1
2 ,
n1n2 + n3n4 + · · · + nr−1nr + r
2,

(

r is odd;

r is even,

then G contains a multipartite cycle of length no more than 3

2r.

Fang, Gy˝ori, Xiao and Xiao recently proved that Conjecture 2 holds for r = 3.
