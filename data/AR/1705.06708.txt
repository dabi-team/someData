Abstract Recent studies indicate that measurements of fractal and multifractal
parameters of active regions (ARs) are not eﬃcient tools to discriminate ARs on
the basis of the ﬂare activity, as well as to predict ﬂare events. Attempting vali-
dation of this result on a large data set of higher spatial and temporal resolution,
as well as higher ﬂux sensitivity, observations than employed in previous studies,
we analyzed high-cadence time series of line-of-sight magnetograms of 43 ARs
characterized by diﬀerent ﬂare activity, which were observed with SDO/HMI
from May 2010 to December 2013. On these data, we estimated four parameters,
the generalized fractal dimensions D0 and D8, and the multifractal parameters
Cdiv and Ddiv. We found distinct average values of the parameters measured
on ARs that have hosted ﬂares of diﬀerent class. However, the dispersion of
values measured on ARs that have produced same class events is such that
the parameters deduced from distinct classes of ﬂaring regions can also largely
overlap. Based on the results of our measurements, C- and M-class ﬂaring ARs
are practically indistinguishable, as well as M- and X-class ﬂaring ARs. We found
consistent changes on the time series of the measured parameters only on ≈ 50%
of the studied ARs and ≈ 50% of the M- and X-class events considered. We show
that these results hold for fractal and multifractal parameter estimates based on
both total unsigned and signed ﬂux data of the analyzed ARs.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂares are among the most energetic events in the solar system. They
occur in active regions (ARs), by involving processes at various heights in the
solar atmosphere that are powered by the magnetic ﬁeld (Shibata and Magara,
2011). Observations show that the photospheric topology of magnetic ﬁeld is
one of the key factors in determining the evolution of ARs. There is a general
trend for large regions to produce large ﬂares, and for more complex regions to
generate more numerous and larger ﬂares than other regions of comparable size
(Sammis, Tang, and Zirin, 2000). Emergence of a bipolar region that interacts
with preexisting magnetic ﬁeld in the corona, and activation of a ﬁlament with
destabilization in the subsisting magnetic region, are known as precursors events
preceding the onset of ﬂares. However, the precise conditions required to create
the enormously energetic (up to 1032 erg on the timescale of hours) ﬂare events
are as yet unknown (Leka and Barnes (2013), and references therein). Because
interplanetary disturbances associated with solar ﬂares can impact space- and
ground-based infrastructures, identiﬁcation of precursor conditions leading to
solar ﬂares is getting a growing interest for practical applications of space weather
forecast (Hapgood, 2012).

Any measurement of magnetic energy and complexity in an AR deserves
interest for testing its sensitivity to single out the ﬂare activity of the region
for space weather forecasts. However, among the various measurements, those
concerning multifractal properties of the region in the photosphere have the
potential of providing information about the interaction between magnetic ﬁeld
and plasma motions that may lead to ﬂare events. Indeed, these parameters are
thought to describe AR properties that can be consequence of a self-organized
evolution (see discussion by e.g. Georgoulis, 2012).

Several studies in the literature indicate that measurements of fractal and
multifractal properties of ARs may help assessing the eruptive potential of the
regions and also predicting their ﬂare activity (for a list of studies carried out
during the last decade see e.g. Ermolli et al. (2014), hereafter Paper I). Never-
theless, the literature also shows conﬂicting conclusions on the eﬃciency of these
measurements to discriminate ﬂaring ARs. For example, McAteer, Gallagher, and Ireland
(2005) reported no discernible diﬀerences between the fractal dimension dis-
tributions of diﬀerent Mount Wilson classes of ARs that were studied on So-
lar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Michelson-Doppler Imager (MDI;
Scherrer et al., 1995) line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms. However, they also showed
that there is a good correlation between the increased ﬂare productivity of ARs,
in terms of both ﬂare size and frequency, and increased fractal dimension mea-
sured in the ARs. Besides, they identiﬁed a lower threshold fractal dimension
value which an AR must possess in order to have the potential to produce an M-
class (X-class) ﬂare. More recently, Georgoulis (2012) reported that none of the
widely-used multifractal parameters measured in his study on a large data set of
SOHO/MDI LOS magnetograms allows to distinguish AR with major ﬂares from
ﬂare-quiet ones, though both classes of solar regions show signiﬁcant fractality
and multifractality. Then, from analysis of higher resolution observations than
employed in the previous study, Georgoulis (2013) also found that the multiscale

SOLA: giorgi_2014.tex; 17 September 2018; 5:43; p. 2

Multifractal Parameters of Flaring Regions on SDO/HMI Magnetograms

parameters measured on Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Heliospheric and
Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al., 2012; Schou et al., 2012; Wachter et al.,
2012) LOS magnetograms of an intensely eruptive AR and of a ﬂare-quiet AR
have fairly similar values and temporal evolutions.

Recent results from an analysis of near-simultaneous observations of a ﬂaring
AR by SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI (Paper I) suggested us to further investi-
gate the response of the fractal and multifractal parameters to the ﬂare activ-
ity of ARs. In particular, Paper I shows that the measurements derived from
SOHO/MDI observations are aﬀected by larger and spurious variations over
time than those deduced from analysis of the higher-quality SDO/HMI data.
Therefore, analysis of higher quality observations of a larger sample of ARs than
analyzed by Georgoulis (2013) may produce measurements of the multifractal
parameters characterized by a signiﬁcantly reduced dispersion than derived by
Georgoulis (2012). The study presented herein investigates the possibility that
a reduced dispersion of multifractal parameters measured on SDO/HMI obser-
vations of ARs may help discriminating ﬂaring from ﬂare-quiet regions. To this
purpose, we analyzed time series of magnetograms of 43 ARs with diﬀerent ﬂare
activity that were observed with SDO/HMI from May 2010 to December 2013.
We also noticed that almost all the studies of multifractal properties in ﬂaring
ARs were carried out on the total unsigned ﬂux measurement of the regions,
which is considered a standard-ﬂare forecasting tool (Barnes and Leka, 2008).
To the knowledge of these authors, only Georgoulis (2005) reported that discrim-
inating between the two polarities in the studied ARs do not alter the results
derived from analysis of total unsigned ﬂux measurements of ARs. New observa-
tional evidences on the physical mechanisms driving the evolution of magnetic
ﬁeld in more ﬂaring ARs, concerning e.g. the photospheric magnetic ﬂux change
and cancellation (Burtseva and Petrie, 2013; Cliver, Petrie, and Ling, 2012) and
the fragmentation of magnetic helicity patches (Romano and Zuccarello, 2011),
suggested us to study multifractal parameters inside ARs, by taking into account
the evolution of magnetic regions with diﬀerent polarities, thus using signed mag-
netic ﬂux measurements for multifractal parameters estimates rather than total
unsigned ﬂux data. It has been also shown that the regions with diﬀerent polarity
in an AR have distinct morphology (see e.g. Yamamoto, 2012) and dynamical
behavior (Giannattasio et al., 2013). Therefore, we also tested the response of
measurements of multifractal parameters based on signed ﬂux measurements to
the ﬂare activity of the ARs.

The paper is organized as follows. The data sets and analysis methods em-
ployed in our study are described in Section 2. Our main ﬁndings are presented
in Section 3, whereas the conclusions of this study are summarized in Section 4.

2. Data and Methods

We analyzed 43 ARs characterized by diﬀerent ﬂare activity that were observed
by SDO/HMI from May 2010 to December 2013. Table 1 lists the ARs in our
sample, by providing information about the ﬂare events hosted by the region and
its ﬂaring level. The latter is described by the ﬂare index (FI; Li et al., 2004),

Multifractal Parameters of Flaring Regions on SDO/HMI Magnetograms

which was computed assuming the ﬂare history of the region depicted by the
NOAA’s GOES X-ray archive during the disc transit of the region, as well as by
considering the most intense event hosted by the region (hereafter referred to
as maximum FI, FI max). FI max is employed in the following to discriminate
the analyzed ARs depending on their ﬂaring activity. In particular, the X-, M-,
and B or C-class ﬂaring ARs discussed below correspond to the regions whose
FI max>100, 10<FI max<100, and FI max<10, respectively.

The AR sample analyzed in our study contains 22 regions that have hosted ≥
M-class ﬂares and 21 regions that have produced from a single B-class to a few
B- or C-class events. The analyzed ARs include all the regions observed from
February 2011 to December 2013 that have produced either M- or X-class ﬂares,
with the disc position speciﬁed in the following, and 17 ARs that were either
ﬂare-quiet (FI max<1) or less ﬂaring (10<FI max<100) than the ﬂaring regions,
observed over the time interval and disc position of the ﬂaring ARs. The sample
also contains 4 ﬂare-quiet ARs observed from May 2010 to January 2011, which
were considered for comparison with results of earlier studies.

According to the data and methods applied in Paper I, the selected ARs
were analyzed using the time series of SDO/HMI Level 1.5 LOS full-disc mag-
netograms when the AR longitudinal distance was within ±30◦ of the central
meridian. The whole data set consists of 20571 magnetograms, each of 4096
×4096 pixels, with a pixel size of 0.505 arcsec and cadence of 720 s. The spatial
resolution is set by the instrument aperture to 1 arcsec. The data set was pro-
cessed as described in Paper I. The main steps are summarized below, following
the description given in the original paper.

From each magnetogram, we extracted a sub-array centered on the AR bari-
center, whose size slightly exceeds 512×512 pixels. On these data, according to
results presented in Paper I and other studies in the literature (e.g. Georgoulis,
2012), geometrical projection eﬀects were not compensated for. Indeed, Paper
I shows that additional de-projection correction only slightly alter the fractal
and multifractal values obtained for the AR, with diﬀerences of measurement
results that are well within uncertainties of values. However, it is worth noting
that the geometrical de-projection of the data does not allow one to recover
the loss of spatial resolution due to the increasing solar area subtended by the
resolution element of the recording device when one moves from the disc center
to the limb. This resolution loss cannot be compensated for when estimating
the fractal and multifractal parameters, but it can be minimized with restriction
of the AR positions analyzed. These considerations motivate the restriction of
our analysis to un-projected ARs with longitudinal distance within ±30◦ of the
central meridian.

On each sub-array, we computed the four parameters describing the fractal
and multifractal properties of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld: the generalized
fractal dimension D0 and D8, and the multifractal Contribution Diversity Cdiv
and Dimensional Diversity Ddiv. These parameters are extensively described by
e.g. McAteer, Gallagher, and Ireland (2005), Criscuoli et al. (2009), Georgoulis
(2012), and in Paper I. We investigated the variation of these parameters with
respect to the ﬂare activity of the analyzed ARs, by considering results derived

SOLA: giorgi_2014.tex; 17 September 2018; 5:43; p. 5

Giorgi et al.

from both the unsigned and signed ﬂux measurements of the photospheric mag-
netic ﬁeld in the observations. The parameters were computed on the region of
interest derived from application of a threshold in the line-of-sight ﬁeld com-
ponent in each sub-array. According to results in Paper I, the threshold values
employed are ± 3 times the standard deviation of quiet sun measurements in
the data, speciﬁcally ± 20 G (gauss). All the sub-arrays employed in our study
are unaﬀected by ﬂux saturation.

The accuracy of the methods and algorithms employed in our study, as well
the eﬀects on the measured values of using diﬀerent thresholds for the analysis,
are discussed in Paper I. The uncertainty associated with the measured values
is equal to the 2-sigma uncertainty for the parameters derived as in Paper I.
This uncertainty is shown in e.g. Figure 1, for the results of the parameter
measurements from unsigned ﬂux data of the analyzed ARs.

3. Results

We focussed our attention on the time series of the various parameters measured
on the analyzed ARs. Figures 1 and 2 show a sample of the analyzed data, which
correspond to the time series of some among the most ﬂaring ARs in the data
set. We ﬁrst studied the main features of these series, aiming at investigating the
possibility that a reduced dispersion of the parameters measured on SDO/HMI
observations may improve the eﬃciency of these measurements to discriminate
ﬂaring from ﬂare-quiet regions with respect to previous reports in the literature.
Section 3.1 presents the average values of the parameters derived from unsigned
ﬂux data of the analyzed ARs, in close analogy to previous results in the litera-
ture, whereas Section 3.2 shows the ﬁndings from the analysis of the signed ﬂux
data of the analyzed regions, aiming at singling out eﬀects of ﬂux discrimination
on measurement results. Section 3.3 presents the main features of the temporal
evolution of the parameters measured from both unsigned and signed ﬂux data
of the studied regions, aiming at highlighting any distinctive patterns in the time
series that can be associated with the ﬂaring activity.

3.1. Average Values of the Parameters from Unsigned Flux Data

Figure 3 shows the time series of fractal and multifractal parameters derived
from total unsigned ﬂux measurements of the analyzed ARs. In order to point
out the dependence of measured values on the AR ﬂaring activity, the results
were divided into three groups, according to the three classes of ﬂaring ARs
introduced in Section 2. The three classes concern the ARs that have hosted B-
or C-class, M-class, and X-class events.

Figure 3 shows that the D0 values measured on all ARs range between ≈
1.50 and ≈ 1.90, in agreement with previous reports in the literature on a signif-
icant fractality of the morphology of the magnetic ﬂux concentration in both
ﬂaring and ﬂare-quiet ARs (see e.g. McAteer, Gallagher, and Ireland (2005),
Conlon et al. (2008), Criscuoli et al. (2009), and Georgoulis (2012) for results

and e.g. Criscuoli et al. (2007) and references therein for the ﬁndings from other
methods). Figure 3 also shows that higher D0 and D8 values, as well as lower
Cdiv and Ddiv, are estimated, on average, for the most ﬂaring regions in the AR
sample, than derived from the more quiet ARs. We found that the diﬀerence
between the values derived from the extreme classes of ﬂaring ARs in our sample
is larger for the D0 and D8 values than for the Cdiv and Ddiv parameters, whose
trends obtained from the three classes of analyzed ARs overlap more than for
the fractal parameters.

Figure 4 shows the average of the parameters measured on each AR. We
found that the parameters derived from the three classes of analyzed ARs are
distributed between a lower and an upper limit, but a systematic diﬀerence be-
tween the trends obtained from distinct classes of ﬂaring ARs seems also to occur.
Indeed, Figure 5 shows the relation between the average value of the parameters
estimated for each AR in the sample and its FI. The measurements were divided
according to the hemisphere hosting the AR, to test any hemispheric signature on
them. In agreement with previous works (e.g. McAteer, Gallagher, and Ireland,
2005; Abramenko, 2005; Criscuoli et al., 2009), we found that higher values of

fractal D0 and D8 parameters, as well as a lower value of Cdiv and Ddiv, imply
a higher ﬂare activity of the ARs, in terms of their FI that account for the ﬂare
size and event frequency. The scatter of data does not support the assumption of
a linear relation between the compared quantities, although a non-linear relation
may hold between them. Figure 5 shows that this result holds likewise for the
ARs of both hemispheres.

The results shown in Figures 3 to 5 are quantiﬁed in Table 2, which summa-
rizes the average and standard deviation of the parameters measured for each
class of analyzed ARs. We found distinct average values of the parameters mea-
sured on ARs that have hosted ﬂares of diﬀerent class. However, the dispersion
of values measured on ARs that have produced same class events is such that
the parameters deduced from distinct classes of ﬂaring regions can also largely
overlap. Based on the results of our measurements, C- and M-class ﬂaring ARs
are practically indistinguishable, as well as M- and X-class ﬂaring ARs. However,
C- and X-class regions can be either discerned or not depending on the analyzed
ARs. These ﬁndings give reasons to some conﬂicting conclusions presented in
the literature on the eﬃciency of the fractal and multifractal measurements to
discriminate ﬂaring ARs. In fact, they conﬁrm the statistical trend reported by

McAteer, Gallagher, and Ireland (2005). They also show that depending on the
analyzed ARs, the fractal and multifractal measurements derived from regions
hosting distinct classes of events may have or may have not similar values, as
reported from the analysis of two ﬂaring and ﬂare-quiet ARs by e.g. Georgoulis
(2013) and by considering the results from the most ﬂaring and most ﬂare-quiet
ARs in the sample analyzed in this study, respectively.

Table 3 lists the linear Pearson correlation coeﬃcients between the measured
parameters and FI. The absolute values of the coeﬃcients derived by taking
into account the parameters deduced from unsigned ﬂux data of the analyzed
ARs range from 0.51 to 0.60, being 0.51 (D0), 0.60 (D8), -0.55 (Cdiv), and -0.52

quantities already reported in the literature.

signatures on the measurements of the leading and trailing ﬂux polarities in the
studied ARs, as well as of the hemisphere hosting the regions. In this respect,
it is worth noting that all analyzed ARs follow the main polarity orientation in
the hemisphere, but AR NOAA 11429 that showed opposite polarity orientation
than the other regions in the northern hemisphere.

For each AR, we found that the fractal D0 values estimated on unsigned
ﬂux data are higher than those obtained by taking into account signed ﬂux
measurements in the same region, whereas the fractal D8 and multifractal Cdiv
and Ddiv values derived from the region do not vary signiﬁcantly with the ﬂux
data employed to estimate the parameter.

SOLA: giorgi_2014.tex; 17 September 2018; 5:43; p. 15

Giorgi et al.

We ascribe the distinct results obtained for the fractal parameter D0 by taking
into account unsigned and signed ﬂux data to the diﬀerent morphological con-
ﬁguration of magnetic ﬂux concentration in an AR, by considering the region as
a whole and its leading and following polarities separately. Indeed, observations
(see e.g. Section 1 of Fan, 2009) show that the ﬂux of the leading polarity in
an AR tends to be concentrated in large well-formed sunspots, whereas the ﬂux
of the following polarity tends to be more dispersed and to have a fragmented
appearance. At any ﬁnite spatial resolution, the latter implies lower average
ﬂux values measured in the analyzed region than actual ones and thus a higher
sensitivity of morphological measurements based on ﬂux data to threshold se-
lection eﬀects. We found signatures in our measurements of these observational
evidences in e.g. the lower average values of the parameters derived from signed
ﬂux data with respect to results from unsigned data, as well as of the values from
the trailing polarity in the analyzed ARs, with respect to the values obtained
from the data of the leading polarity ﬂux in the ARs. The lower sensitivity of
the fractal D8 and multifractal Cdiv and Ddiv measurements on the ﬂux data
employed for the study than obtained from D0 suggests us that measurements
of the former parameters on signed ﬂux data may beneﬁt from analysis of higher
resolution observations than employed in this study. In fact, the former parame-
ters, by corresponding to a higher order estimates of the fractal dimension than
D0, may require larger data set to allow similar statistical signiﬁcance of results
than obtained for D0.

Figure 8 shows the relation between the average values of the parameters
estimated by taking into account the signed ﬂux data of each analyzed AR
and its FI. The results in this Figure conﬁrm the ﬁndings derived from the
measurements of the parameters based on unsigned ﬂux data of the analyzed
ARs. In particular, they conﬁrm both the weak relation between the compared
quantities and lack of distinctive hemispheric signatures on the measurements.
Tables 2 and 3 quantify the results discussed above. In particular, the average
and standard deviation of values measured by discriminating the ﬂux data in the
analyzed ARs reported in Table 2, as well as the Pearson correlation coeﬃcients
between the measured values and FI of the analyzed ARs listed in Table 3, con-
ﬁrm previous conclusions by Georgoulis (2005) on that discriminating between
the ﬂux polarities in the ARs do not alter the results derived from analysis of
total unsigned ﬂux data of the regions. Indeed, in this study, the lower values
obtained for the Pearson coeﬃcients of the parameters based on signed ﬂux data
in the analyzed ARs show that discriminating between the ﬂux polarities has
even reduced the weak correlation between the compared quantities, with respect
to results based on unsigned ﬂux data of the ARs.

3.3. Temporal Evolution of the Parameters

We then focussed our attention on the temporal evolution of the various pa-
rameters measured on the whole sample of analyzed ARs, aiming at identifying
any clear patterns on the parameter series that can be associated with the ﬂare
activity of the ARs. Here in the following the term variation indicates the devia-
tion of measured values with respect to the average and long-term trends of the

Figure 9. Variance of the distribution of the fractal and multifractal parameters measured
on each region versus the maximum ﬂare index of the studied AR. The parameter values refer
to the deviation of measurement results with respect to the average trend of the parameter
that was obtained with a running average of the values measured over a 3 h time interval.
Shown are results from unsigned magnetic ﬂux measurements in the ARs of the generalized
fractal dimension D0 and D8 (top panels), and multifractal parameters Cdiv and Ddiv (bottom
panels). The ARs were divided into three classes (vertical dashed lines), depending on the value
of their maximum ﬂare index.

parameters. These trends were deﬁned as speciﬁed in the following. The variation
of measured values has been quantiﬁed by the variance of the distribution of
measured values, as well as by the distinct patterns identiﬁed on the analyzed
series.

First, we studied the distribution of parameter values measured for each region
during its transit over the solar disc and the dependence of the distribution
variance σ on the ﬂaring activity of the AR. In particular, we computed the
distribution of parameter values measured for each region with respect to the
average and longer-term trends of the parameters, which were obtained with a
running average of values measured over 3 and 12 h time interval, respectively.
We then estimated the width of the Gaussian function that best ﬁts the measured
distribution and assumed this width as an estimate of the distribution variance
σ.

Figure 9 shows the σ measured for each AR in the analyzed sample with
respect to its FI max. We found that the distribution of values derived from
the less ﬂaring regions are characterized by a larger variance with respect to
the ones obtained from the more ﬂaring ARs. However, the variance of the
values derived from all analyzed ARs does not show any clear dependence on
the ﬂaring activity of the regions, by disclaiming the idea that more ﬂaring
ARs may leave the signature of their activity in more varying time series of the
measured parameters. This result holds likewise for the variance of the values

Giorgi et al.

measured with respect to both the average and longer-term trends of measured
values.

We then analyzed the time series derived from each AR and their main fea-
tures. A sample of the analyzed data has been already shown in Figures 1 and
2. We found that the time series of the D0 and D8 fractal parameters measured
on the whole sample of ARs show smaller and more regular variations during
the analyzed time intervals than the corresponding trends of the Cdiv and Ddiv
multifractal values. This holds for results derived from both unsigned and signed
ﬂux data in the studied ARs. We found that D8 shows slightly larger changes
than D0, as Ddiv also does with respect to Cdiv, and particularly when results
obtained from signed ﬂux data are taken into account. This result suggests us
that measurements of these parameters on signed ﬂux data may beneﬁt from
analysis of higher resolution data than employed in this study.

We also found that most of the studied series show diﬀerent evolution during
the analyzed time intervals depending on the ﬂux data employed to estimate
the parameters. In particular, we found that the time series of the parameters
derived from a given ﬁeld polarity are less consistent with those obtained from
unsigned ﬂux data on the same regions, which resulted to be rather representa-
tive of the parameter trends deduced from the opposite ﬂux polarity in the ARs.
Speciﬁcally, the most varying trends for all measured parameters were found to
be the ones deduced from the trailing ﬂux data of the analyzed ARs,
i.e. the
data of the ﬂux concentration with higher fragmentation and thus also higher
sensitivity of measurement results to the ﬁnite spatial resolution of the analyzed
data. The trends of the parameter estimates based on the prevailing leader
polarity in the hemisphere hosting the AR were found to be more consistent
with those obtained from unsigned ﬂux data. These features of the time series,
speciﬁcally the similarity between the trends deduced from unsigned and leading
polarity ﬂux of the analyzed ARs and the deviation between the same trends
and those from the trailing polarity ﬂux, were found to hold for ≈ 90% of the
studied regions. It is worth noting that the parameter time series of AR NOAA
11429, which is the only region in the analyzed data set that showed opposite
polarity orientation than the other regions, do no follow the results derived from
most of the data analyzed.

From analysis of the parameter series we also found that several ﬂares occur
during a decreasing phase of theDdiv and an increasing phase of the D8 values
estimated by considering unsigned and signed ﬂux data of the leading polarity
of the AR hemisphere. However, those features of the parameter trends were
not found to be a consistent pre-ﬂare signature on the whole sample of ARs and
events. Indeed, this event signature was found on ≈ 50% of the analyzed ARs and
on ≈ 50% of the ≥ M-class events considered. We also found that theDdiv trends
obtained by considering the trailing polarity of the ARs show changes lasting few
hours (< 10) and occurring both prior (≈ 15 h) and after major events, as shown
in Figure 2 for e.g. AR 11158 and AR 11875, where B- and B+ is the trailing
polarity in the region, respectively. These changes in Ddiv, whose amplitude
ranges 0.20% to 0.25% of the parameter value independently of the event class,
are compatible with a simpliﬁcation of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld in ﬂaring
ARs through sudden changes of the trailing ﬂux topology. However, they were
found on ≈ 50% of the analyzed ARs and events.

4. Conclusion

The present study shows that the analysis of a large data set of higher spatial
and temporal resolution, as well as higher ﬂux sensitivity, observations than
employed in previous studies does not give the fractal and multifractal parameter
measurements a higher eﬃciency to discriminate ARs depending on their ﬂaring
activity than reported in the literature. The measurements derived from our
study hint to a signature of the ﬂare activity in the fractal and multifractal
parameters of ARs and a potential diﬀerentiation depending on their ﬂare ac-
tivity, but this does not hold in general for all the analyzed ARs. In particular,
we found distinct average values of the parameters measured on ARs that have
hosted ﬂares of diﬀerent class, in agreement with the statistical trend reported by
McAteer, Gallagher, and Ireland (2005). At a ﬁrst glance, our ﬁndings contrast
with results presented by e.g. Georgoulis (2013). However, we also show that
the dispersion of values deduced from each class of ﬂaring AR considered in our
study is such that results from extreme classes of ﬂaring ARs can also overlap,
as shown in e.g. Figure 8 of Georgoulis (2013).

The results obtained by our study also show that the parameter estimates
based on signed ﬂux measurements do not constitute a better predictive tool
of the ﬂare activity than derived by using unsigned ﬂux data as in previous
studies. In particular, we found that the time series of the parameters obtained
from unsigned ﬂux data of the analyzed ARs are rather representative of those
deduced from the signed ﬂux measurements of the prevailing leader polarity
in the hemisphere hosting the ARs. Both time series show that the ﬂares oc-
cur during a decreasing phase of theDdiv and an increasing phase of the D8
parameters on ≈ 50% of the analyzed ARs and on ≈ 50% of the ≥ M-class
events considered. The times series of parameters deduced from signed ﬂux data
of the trailing polarity ﬂux in the analyzed ARs are less consistent with those
derived from unsigned ﬂux data of the studied region. The former time series
show changes of the evolution of the Ddiv values lasting few hours and occurring
both prior and after major events. These changes, which are compatible with
a simpliﬁcation of the magnetic ﬁeld in the ARs, were found on ≈ 50% of the
analyzed regions and events.

The results obtained in this study give reasons to the conﬂicting conclusions
reported in the literature on the eﬃciency of the fractal and multifractal pa-
rameter measurements based on unsigned ﬂux data of ARs to discriminate them
depending on their ﬂaring activity. They also extend the validity of the previous
ﬁndings to results derived from signed ﬂux measurements of the analyzed ARs.
It remains to be shown whether other parameters describing the magnetic ﬁeld
evolution and morphological complexity based either on signed or other ﬂux data
of the analyzed regions prove to be more ideal tools for discriminating ﬂaring
ARs than those analyzed in this study.
