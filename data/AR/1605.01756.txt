Abstract Neutrinoless double electron capture is a pro-
cess that, if detected, would give evidence of lepton
number violation and the Majorana nature of neutri-
nos. A search for neutrinoless double electron capture
of 36Ar has been performed with germanium detectors
installed in liquid argon using data from Phase I of
the GERmanium Detector Array (Gerda) experiment
at the Gran Sasso Laboratory of INFN, Italy. No sig-
nal was observed and an experimental lower limit on
the half-life of the radiative neutrinoless double elec-
tron capture of 36Ar was established: T1/2 > 3.6 × 1021
yr at 90 % C.I.

1 Introduction

The observation of neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ):

(A, Z − 2) → (A, Z) + 2e−,

(1)

can provide unambiguous information on lepton num-
ber violation and indicate the Majorana nature of neu-
trinos, regardless the physics mechanism responsible
for the decay. Currently many experiments are search-
ing for this decay considering diﬀerent isotopes. Among
these is the Gerda (GERmanium Detector Array) ex-
periment [1] implementing bare germanium detectors
enriched in 76Ge. This experiment searches for neutri-
noless double beta decay of 76Ge. Recently the best
limit on 0νββ decay half-life of 76Ge has been published
by the Gerda collaboration [2].

Another lepton number violating process that can
provide the same information as neutrinoless double
beta decay is the double capture of two bound atomic
electrons without the emission of neutrinos (0νECEC):

2e− + (A, Z + 2) → (A, Z) + Q,

(2)

where the quantity Q corresponds to the energy diﬀer-
ence between the ground state atoms (A, Z + 2) and
(A, Z) [3, 4]. While in the corresponding process where

two neutrinos are emitted (2νECEC) the available en-
ergy of the decay is carried away by neutrinos plus X-
rays or Auger electrons, in the neutrinoless double elec-
tron capture the decay must be accompanied by the
emission of at least another particle to ensure energy
and momentum conservation. Diﬀerent modes can be
considered in which 0νECEC decay is associated with
the emission of diﬀerent particles like e+e− pairs, one
or two photons, or one internal conversion electron. A
detailed discussion about double electron capture pro-
cesses can be found in Refs. [5, 6, 7].

For 0+ → 0+ transitions the capture of two K-shell
electrons with the emission of only one photon is forbid-
den because of angular momentum conservation. There-
fore, the most likely process is the capture from the K-
and the L-shell. The diagram of this mode is depicted in
Fig. 1. The unstable daughter atom relaxes by emission
of X-rays or Auger electrons.

At present, only two experiments found an indica-
tion of two neutrino double electron capture. The ﬁrst
is based on a geochemical measurement of 130Ba decay
into 130Xe [8,9] and the second is a large-volume cop-
per proportional counter searching for double K-shell
capture in 78Kr [10]. Several experiments including the
latter established limits on both neutrino accompanied
and neutrinoless double electron capture of diﬀerent iso-
topes (see Refs. [10,11, 12, 13,14, 15, 16,17]). For some
isotopes the possibility of a resonant enhancement of
the 0νECEC decay has been predicted in case of mass
degeneracy between the initial state and an excited ﬁnal
state [4, 18].

36Ar is expected to undergo double electron cap-
ture to the ground state of 36S [19]. The available en-
ergy of the decay is 432.6±0.2 keV and, therefore, both
the radiative and the internal conversion modes are en-
ergetically allowed [20]. A resonance enhancement of
the decay is not possible for this isotope. Calculations
based on the quasiparticle random-phase approxima-

ppnnxebound−ebound−W+W+(A,Z)(A,Z+2)tion (QRPA) predict a half-life for 36Ar in the order
of 1038 yr for an eﬀective Majorana neutrino mass of
1 eV [21]. So far, an experimental limit on the radiative
mode obtained during detector characterizations in the
Gerda Detector Laboratory has been published (T1/2
> 1.9·1018 yr at 68 % C.L.) [22].

The radiative mode of 0νECEC in 36Ar with the
emission of one photon provides a clear signature through
the discrete value of its energy and allows the detector
to be separate from the source of the decay. Two cas-
cades of characteristic X-rays with energies of EK =
2.47 keV and EL = 0.23 keV are emitted, correspond-
ing to the capture of the electrons from the K- and
the L-shell, respectively. The corresponding energy for
the monochromatic photon is Eγ = Q − Ek − EL =
429.88 ± 0.19 keV.

This paper reports the search for the 429.88 keV γ
line from 0νECEC decay of 36Ar with Gerda Phase I
germanium detectors and the determination of a limit
on its half-life.

2 The Gerda experiment

The Gerda experiment [1] is located at the Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso (Lngs) of the INFN. It was
designed in two phases. During Phase I reprocessed p-
type semi-coaxial High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) de-
tectors enriched in 76Ge (enrGe) to up to 86 % [26] from
the HdM [23] and Igex [24] experiments have been
employed in the experiment as well as natural germa-
nium (natGe) HPGe detectors from the Genius Test
Facility and newly produced enriched Broad Energy
Germanium (BEGe) detectors [25]. The bare detectors
are immersed into a cryostat containing 64 m3 (89.2 t)
of LAr, which acts both as the coolant medium and
a shield against external radiation. The isotopic abun-
dance of 36Ar in natural argon is 0.3336(4) % [27], which
sums up to about 298 kg. An additional shield of ultra
pure water (10 m in diameter) surrounds the cryostat
containing the argon. The water tank is instrumented
with 66 PMTs as a muon Cherenkov veto [28]. Each
detector string is surrounded by a 60 µm thick Cu foil
(“mini-shroud”), to limit drifting of 42K ions to detector
surfaces. In addition, to mitigate radon contamination,
a 30 µm Cu cylinder (“radon shroud”) surrounds the
array of strings.

3 Data taking and data selection

The data taking of Gerda Phase I started in Novem-
ber 2011 and ended in May 2013. Until March 2012, the

3

setup included 8 enrGe semi-coaxial and 3 natGe semi-
coaxial detectors. Two months later, two of the natGe
semi-coaxial detectors were replaced by ﬁve new enrGe
BEGe detectors. A higher background was observed
during this period (49 d), therefore it was excluded from
this analysis. The data taking was separated into runs,
with a duration of about one month each. Detectors
which showed instabilities during speciﬁc runs where
removed from the analysis. Two detectors showed insta-
bilities from the very beginning of data taking. There-
fore, data collected from these detectors were discarded.
The total collected data used for the search for 0νECEC
of 36Ar correspond to a life time of about 460 d. The
data were divided into three diﬀerent data sets, one
containing data from natural semi-coaxial detectors (la-
beled as natCoax), one containing data from enriched
semi-coaxial detectors (enrCoax) and the last contain-
ing data collected by BEGe detectors (enrBEGe). The
energy spectra from the three data sets are shown in
Fig. 2. The left panel shows the energy spectra weighted
with the product of life time and detector mass. The
right panel displays the energy region between 360 and
500 keV. Indeed, in the region around 429.88 keV, en-
riched and natural detectors are characterized by dif-
ferent contributions to the spectrum, in particular due
to 2νββ decays from 76Ge in the enriched ones. In addi-
tion, BEGe detectors are considered as a separate data
set because of the improved energy resolution with re-
spect to semi-coaxial detectors. The main contribution
to the spectrum around 430 keV is due to 39Ar β decays.
The spectral shape is diﬀerent for BEGe detectors due
to the diﬀerent detector geometry and outer dead layer
thickness.

Oﬄine reconstruction of Gerda data was performed
within the Gelatio software framework [29]. Detector
signals are read out by charge sensitive preampliﬁers
and then digitized by 100 MHz ﬂash analog to digital
converters (FADCs). Preceded by a ∼80 µs long base-
line, the charge signal rises up with a rise time of ∼1 µs
and is followed by a ∼80 µs long exponential tail. The
energy of each event is estimated by applying an opti-
mized Zero Area Cusp ﬁlter [30] to the digitized signal.
Cuts based on the baseline slope, the number of trig-
gers and the position of the rising edge were applied to
remove pile-up events and accidental coincidences. All
detected events within 8 µs from the muon veto trigger
were also rejected. Finally, an anti-coincidence cut was
applied to remove events with an energy deposition in
more than one detector.

The energy calibration was performed during dedi-
cated calibration runs (every one or two weeks) in which
three 228Th sources were lowered to the vicinity of the
detectors. In addition, the stability of the system was

Fig. 2 Energy spectra from the three data sets collected during Gerda Phase I. The left panel shows the energy spectra
weighted with the product of life time and detector mass. The right panel displays the energy region between 360 and 500 keV.
The shaded area corresponds to the ROI deﬁned between 410 and 450 keV

continuously monitored by injecting test charge pulses
into the input of the preampliﬁers. The energy depen-
dence of the resolution was obtained for each data set
from the summed calibration spectra and then the value
at the signal peak position of 429.88 keV was derived.
The 42K background γ line at 1524.7 keV in the physics
data was used to determine a correction factor in case
its energy resolution diﬀered more than one standard
deviation from the one obtained during the calibrations.
To combine the diﬀerent values into a single value for
the data set, the average of the energy resolution of
each detector was calculated weighted with the signal
detection eﬃciency of the detector. The uncertainty on
the resolution is primarily coming from the ﬁt of the
resolution curve and is largest for the detectors that
require the correction factor [31]. The expected Full
Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) value at 429.88 keV
is 4.08±0.20 keV for the natCoax, 3.72±0.05 keV for the
enrCoax and 2.01 ± 0.10 keV for the enrBEGe data set.
The systematic uncertainty on the FWHM, estimated
by comparing the resolution of the summed calibration
spectra to the average resolution of the single calibra-
tions, is ± 0.05 keV.

4 Determination of the half-life of 0νECEC of
36Ar

A limit on the half-life T1/2 of 0νECEC decay of 36Ar
was determined considering the data of Gerda Phase I
discussed in Section 3. The region of interest (ROI)
around the signal, the 429.88 keV γ line from the 0νECEC
decay, is deﬁned between 410 and 450 keV. The energy
spectrum of coincidence events shows the presence of
the three γ lines from 108mAg [32]. 108mAg has a half-
life of 418 yr and undergoes electron capture into the

6+ excited state of 108Pd with a probability of 91.3 %.
The de-excitation of the daughter nucleus leads to three
equally probable γ rays in the ﬁnal state, with ener-
gies of 433.9 keV, 614.3 keV and 722.9 keV. The pres-
ence of 108mAg was also observed in the screening mea-
surements. For these reasons the 433.9 keV γ line from
108mAg in the ROI was taken into account in the anal-
ysis. The determination of the detection eﬃciency and
the analysis result are discussed in the following.

Detection eﬃciency

The detection eﬃciency ε is deﬁned as the number of
γ rays which entirely deposit their energy inside a sin-
gle Gerda detector. It has been determined by Monte
Carlo simulations employing the MaGe software frame-
work [33] based on Geant4 [34]. 109 γ rays with an en-
ergy of 429.88 keV were generated in a cylindrical LAr
volume with a radius of 67 cm and a height of 130 cm,
centered around the detector array. The considered vol-
ume corresponds to 1827 l of LAr equivalent to 7.7 kg
of 36Ar. The contribution from γ rays originating from
outside this volume to the number of full energy depo-
sitions is less than the statistical uncertainty of 0.2 %.
The full eﬃciency for each data set was derived by sum-
ming up the individual detector eﬃciencies weighted for
the life time of each run. Their systematic uncertainty is
dominated by two main contributions: the uncertainty
on the Monte Carlo processes, whose eﬀect on the ef-
ﬁciency was estimated to be 4 %, and the uncertainty
on the dead layer of the germanium detectors. The lat-
ter was estimated by independently varying for each
detector the dead layer values within ±1 standard de-
viation. This changes the eﬃciency of 8-10 % for a sin-
gle semi-coaxial detector and 3.5-6 % for a single BEGe

detector. The uncertainty for the three data sets, calcu-
lated assuming full correlation among the uncertainties
of individual detectors, is 9.17 % for the natCoax and
enrCoax data sets and 4.51 % for the enrBEGe data set.
The total systematic uncertainty on the eﬃciency is ob-
tained by summing in quadrature the two contributions
and amounts to 10 % for the natCoax data set, 10 % for
the enrCoax data set and 6 % for the enrBEGe data set.
Statistical uncertainties are negligible with respect

to systematic ones.

and B1,d describe the linear background and BAg,d the
count expectation of the 108mAg peak. A Bayesian ap-
proach was used to extract the posterior probability
density on T −1

rameters, six describing the signal peak (εd, σd), six
for the linear background (B0,d, B1,d), three for the
108mAg peak (BAg,d). T −1
1/2 and δE are in common to all
data sets. The parameters εd, σd and δE are constrained
by Gaussian shaped prior distributions whose sigma is
given by their systematic uncertainty. A ﬂat prior is
considered for the remaining parameters, including the
inverse half-life T −1
1/2. Furthermore, B0,d, BAg,d and T −1

The median sensitivity for the 90 % C.I. limit was esti-
mated with toy Monte Carlo simulations and is equal to
2.7 · 1021 yr. The sum spectrum of all data sets around
the ROI and the ﬁt functions are displayed in Fig. 3 to-
gether with the marginalized posterior distribution for
T −1
1/2.

Systematic uncertainties are directly folded into the
ﬁt through the Gaussian priors associated to param-
eters εd, σd and δE. They weaken the limit by about
0.3 %, which was evaluated by ﬁxing these 7 parameters
and repeating the ﬁt with the remaining 10 parameters.
To test if the model described in Eq. 5 is suﬃcient,
the p-value was calculated for the three data sets, as
proposed in Ref. [35] using a 1 keV binning. The ob-
tained values are 0.96, 0.11 and 0.91 for the natCoax,
enrCoax and enrBEGe data sets respectively and indi-
cate that the model describes the data suﬃciently well.
The ﬁt result for BAg shows the presence of the 433.9
keV γ line in the natCoax data set. The 90 % C.I. limit
is reduced by 10 % in case the presence of this line is
neglected in the ﬁt. The expectation value for the num-
ber of counts from the 108mAg γ line for the three data
sets is reported in Table 1 together with the ﬁt result
for B0 which represents the number of events from the
linear background component at the signal peak energy
of 429.88 keV (third term of Eq. 5). In the same table
the eﬃciency values and the energy resolution are also
reported.

5 Conclusions

Gerda established the most stringent half-life limit on
the radiative mode of neutrinoless double electron cap-
ture of 36Ar with Phase I data. The limit is three orders
of magnitude larger than previous results for this iso-
tope; however, it is still orders of magnitude far from
the theoretical prediction from QRPA calculations.
