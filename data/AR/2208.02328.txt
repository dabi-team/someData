ABSTRACT

Context. The Andromeda (M 31) galaxy presents evidence of a recent substantial mass accretion, diﬀerently from the Milky Way that
had a rather quiescent evolution.
Aims. We use oxygen and argon abundances for planetary nebulae (PNe) with low internal extinction (progenitor ages of > 4.5 Gyr)
and high extinction (progenitor ages < 2.5 Gyr), as well as those of the HII regions, to constrain the chemical enrichment and star
formation eﬃciency in the thin and thicker discs of M31.
Methods. The argon element is produced in larger fraction by Type Ia supernovae (SNe) than oxygen. We ﬁnd that the mean log(O/Ar)
values of PNe as a function of their argon abundances 12 + log(Ar/H) trace the inter-stellar matter (ISM) conditions at the time of
birth of the M 31 disc PN progenitors. Thus the chemical enrichment and star formation eﬃciency information encoded in the [α/Fe]
vs. [Fe/H] distribution of stars is also imprinted in the oxygen-to-argon abundance ratio log(O/Ar) vs. argon abundance for the nebular
emissions of the diﬀerent stellar evolution phases. We propose to use the log(O/Ar) vs. (12 + log(Ar/H)) distribution of PNe with
diﬀerent ages to constrain the star-formation histories of the parent stellar populations in the thin and thicker M31 discs.
Results. For the inner M31 disc (RGC < 14 kpc), the chemical evolution model that reproduces the mean log(O/Ar) values as function
of argon abundance for the high- and low-extinction PNe requires a second infall of metal poorer gas during a gas-rich (wet) satellite
merger. This wet merger triggered the burst of star-formation seen by the PHAT survey in the M31 disc, ∼ 3 Gyr ago. A strong
starburst is on going in the intermediate radial range (14 ≤ RGC ≤ 18 kpc ). In the outer M31 disc (RGC > 18 kpc), the log(O/Ar) vs
argon abundance distribution of the younger high extinction PNe indicates that they too were formed in a burst, but mostly from the
metal poorer gas. Present-day HII regions show a range of oxygen to argon ratios indicative of spatial variations, consistent with a
present day rainfall of metal poorer gas onto the disc with diﬀerent degree of mixing with the previously enriched ISM.
Conclusions. We implement the use of the log(O/Ar) vs argon abundance distribution for emission nebulae as a complement to the
[α/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagram for stars, and use it to constrain the star formation eﬃciency in M31 thin and thicker discs. Diagrams
for M31 PNe in diﬀerent age ranges reveal that a secondary infall of gas aﬀected the chemical evolution of the M31 disc. In M31,
the thin disc is younger and less radially extended, formed stars at a higher star formation eﬃciency, and had a faster chemical
enrichment timescale than the more extended, thicker disc. Both the thin and thicker disc in M31 reach similar high argon abundances
(12 + log(Ar/H)) (cid:39) 6.7. The chemical and structural properties of the thin/thicker discs in M31 are thus remarkably diﬀerent from
those determined for the Milky Way thin and thick discs.

1. Introduction

Late-type galaxies may contain kinematically distinct compo-
nents such as the “cold" thin disc and the “hot" thick disc found

in the Milky Way (MW; e.g. Gilmore & Reid 1983) and in
nearby galaxies (Yoachim & Dalcanton 2006; Comerón et al.
2019). The MW thick disc is structurally and chemically dis-

tinct from the MW thin disc as well as in age. Diﬀerences
in the structural parameters (stellar masses, exponential scale
lengths, and velocity dispersion) of the MW thin and thick discs
are summarized in Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard (2016). The dif-
ferent chemical properties are most prominent in the measured
stellar [α/Fe] ratios as a function of [Fe/H], with the old MW
thick disc being more metal-poor and α-enriched, compared to
the relatively younger MW thin disc (Hayden et al. 2015; Mat-
teucci 2021). The α-enriched thick disk population is found to
be conﬁned within R (cid:39) 9 kpc, and older than ∼ 8 Gyr (Haywood
et al. 2013; Belokurov et al. 2020), whereas the outer MW disc is
composed of low [α/Fe] stars (Hayden et al. 2015). These prop-
erties are believed to have been set by the MW’s most recent
impactful merger ∼10 Gyr ago (Belokurov et al. 2018; Helmi
et al. 2018), after which the MW disc is thought to have evolved
mainly by secular evolution (see, e.g., Sellwood 2014).

Diﬀerently from the MW, M 31 had a more turbulent his-
tory, as vividly illustrated by the many substructures identiﬁed
in its inner halo by PAndAS (McConnachie et al. 2009, 2018),
including the Giant Stellar Stream (GSS, Ibata et al. 2001). Its
most recent important merger is believed to have happened ∼
2.5–4.5 Gyr ago (Bhattacharya et al. 2019b, hereafter Paper II).
The M31 disc has a signiﬁcantly steeper age-velocity dispersion
(AVD) relation than that of the MW disc (Paper II; Dorman et al.
2015), with the velocity dispersion of the 2.5 Gyr and 4.5 Gyr
old stellar populations being almost twice resp. three times those
of the MW disc stellar populations of corresponding ages. Pa-
per II used planetary nebulae as kinematic tracers to identify a
younger (progenitor ages < 2.5 Gyr), dynamically colder disk,
and a distinct, older (progenitor ages > 4.5 Gyr), dynamically
hotter, hence thicker disc, with the latter having a velocity dis-
persion σM31,thick (cid:39) 3 × σMW,thick in the radial range 14-20 kpc
(equivalent to the solar neighbourhood). At these radial distances
(RGC =14–20 kpc), the 4.5 Gyr and older population of stars had
velocity dispersion values ≥ 90 kms−1, which are signiﬁcantly
larger even than the average velocity dispersion measured for
strongly turbulent discs at redshift ∼ 1 − 2, 30 and 60 kms−1,
respectively, see Wisnioski et al. (2015). Mergers with satellites
can dynamically heat thin discs, i.e., increase their velocity dis-
persion (Quinn & Goodman 1986) and decrease their rotational
velocity, resulting in a thickened disc (Hopkins et al. 2009). Us-
ing their results, the AVD relation of the M 31 disc in a radial
range RGC =14–20 kpc was found to be consistent with the en-
ergy injected in the M 31 disc by a major merger with mass ratio
∼1:5 ∼2.5–4.5 Gyr ago (Bhattacharya et al. 2019b), as predicted
in the merger simulations of Hammer et al. (2018).

The diﬀerent merger histories of these two spiral galaxies are
seen in their large separation in the halo metallicity vs. total stel-
lar mass diagram, where the MW and M31 are placed at opposite
edges of the distribution of galaxies measured by the GHOST
survey (Monachesi et al. 2019). In simulations, the spread in halo
masses and [Fe/H] values is found to be indicative of diﬀerent
accretion histories (D’Souza & Bell 2018) and accreted satellite
stellar mass. Independent conﬁrmation of a recent major merger
event in M31 can be sought through chemical abundances, al-
tered by merger-related processes such as gas accretion and star
formation bursts (e.g. Kobayashi & Nakasato 2011).

Planetary nebulae (PNe) are useful tracers to constrain the
kinematics (Aniyan et al. 2018, 2021) and chemical abundances
(Magrini et al. 2016; Stanghellini & Haywood 2018) over a large
radial range in nearby galaxies of diﬀerent morphological types
(e.g. Cortesi et al. 2013; Pulsoni et al. 2018; Hartke et al. 2022).
PN elemental abundances shed light on the ISM conditions at
the time of formation of their parent stellar population. When

Article number, page 2 of 14

the PN ages are also constrained, it becomes possible to map
abundance variations across diﬀerent epochs of star formation
in galaxies. Abundance distributions and gradients in galaxies
were measured using PNe (Maciel & Koppen 1994; Magrini
et al. 2016; Kwitter & Henry 2021). In the MW, negative ra-
dial oxygen abundance gradient for both thin and thick disc were
indi-
constrained using PNe (Stanghellini & Haywood 2018),
cating inside-out disk formation. With this aim a large survey
of M31 planetary nebulae was undertaken (Bhattacharya et al.
2019a). While it is not possible to determine the [α/Fe] abun-
dance ratio in PNe for constraining the chemical evolution, dif-
ferent chemical enrichment timescales which result from distinct
star-formation histories also leave imprints in the abundance dis-
tribution of other elements (see Nomoto et al. 2013, and refer-
ences therein).

Bhattacharya et al. (2022, hereafter Paper IV) measured dis-
tinct oxygen and argon abundance distributions for the thin and
thicker discs in M31. They measured a ﬂat or slightly positive
oxygen and argon gradients for the older, thicker disc, and a
negative metallicity gradient for the younger thin disc in M31.
These results are consistent with a major merger with 1:5 mass
ratio for M31. In the simulations of Hammer et al. (2018), a gas-
rich satellite is accreted on to M 31 with an orbit along the GSS.
The merger then heats the pre-existing M31 disc, generating the
observed thicker disc. The cold gas accreted through the “wet”
merger would lead to a burst of star formation and the formation
of a late, more centrally concentrated thin disc. Because of the
merger–driven disc evolution, stars in the thin and thicker discs
of M 31 would have formed at diﬀerent epochs under diﬀerent
chemical conditions. Those in the younger thin disc would have
formed out of the pre-enriched interstellar gas in M31, mixed
with metal-poorer gas brought in by the satellite.

In this paper we investigate whether the diﬀerent chemical
enrichment of the thicker and thin discs in M31 provide “smok-
ing gun" evidence that the secondary gas infall predicted by such
a gas-rich merger took place. We will use the direct measure-
ments of oxygen and argon abundances for the M 31 disc PNe
over the 2 − 30 kpc radial range to constrain the chemical en-
richment and the star formation eﬃciency in the thin and thicker
disc. We further combine the PNe abundance measurements with
those for the HII regions in the M31 disc already available in the
literature. The oxygen and argon measurements from Paper IV
are brieﬂy presented in Section 2. The use of oxygen and argon
abundances as chemical tracers in M 31 is discussed in Section 3,
as well as the chemical enrichment timescales inferred for the
two disc components. In Section 4 we present the constraints on
the chemical evolution and formation history of M 31. We ad-
dress the gas content of the merging satellite in the M 31 disc in
Section 5, and conclude in Section 6.

2. Data sample, abundance measurements and

gradients

2.1. The PN sample in M31 with O and Ar abundances

In Bhattacharya et al. (2019a), PN candidates were selected in
a 16 sq. deg. [OIII] 5007 Å narrow plus g-broad band imaging
survey covering the disc and inner halo of M 31, with MegaCam
at the CFHT. This was later expanded to cover a total of 54 sq.
deg in M31 (Bhattacharya et al. 2021). Spectroscopic follow-up
of a complete sub-sample of these PN candidates were carried
out with the Hectospec multiﬁbre positioner and spectrograph
on the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT; Fabricant et al. 2005).

Magda Arnaboldi et al.: O/Ar abundances in the M 31 thin and thicker discs from PNe

Spectral range covers from 3685Å in the blue to approx 9200 Å
in the red, with a spectral resolution in the range 850 − 1500.

The oxygen and argon direct abundance measurements, via
the detection of the temperature sensitive line [O iii] at 4363 Å ,
with their errors, for a magnitude limited sample of PNe in the
M31 disc, are described in Paper IV which includes the cata-
logue with the measured quantities (their errors). We also refer to
Paper IV for a comprehensive description of the PNe magnitude
limited sample and the abundance gradients. In this work we ex-
tend the analysis of the oxygen and argon abundances to con-
strain the chemical enrichment and the star formation timescales
of the discs of M31.

the identiﬁcation of

To this aim, we implement

the
thin/thicker discs in M31 of Bhattacharya et al. (2019b), based
on the ages and dynamical properties of their PN populations,
and then derive their star formation histories and chemical evo-
lution. In the M31 magnitude-limited disc PNe sample, there are
75 high-extinction, 2.5 Gyr and younger PNe associated with
the more rapidly rotating thin disc, and 130 low extinction, 4.5
Gyrs and older PNe, associated with the thicker disc, which has
a larger asymmetric drift. The high extinction PNe are found at
smaller radii (RGC < 22 kpc) than the low extinction PNe, which
instead cover the entire extent of the disc (out to RGC = 30 kpc).
We note that the structural properties of thin/thick discs in
nearby spiral galaxiess show thin discs embedded in thicker
discs, with the latter having longer scale lengths than the thin
component (Yoachim & Dalcanton 2006). This is similar to what
is found for the M31 PNe 2.5 Gyr and younger sample. Further-
more the age determined for the thicker disk in M31 falls within
the age range, from 4 to 10 Gyr, determined from Lick indices
for the thick discs of local spirals (Yoachim & Dalcanton 2008).

2.2. The PN sample in M31 as tracers of the ISM chemical

properties

As a ﬁrst step in using the PN oxygen over argon ratio vs. argon
abundance, 12 + log(Ar/H), distribution to constrain the ISM
conditions, we explore the dependency of the PNe log(O/Ar)
ratio on i) their circumstellar dust properties, ii) initial stellar
masses and iii) ages. According to Ventura et al. (2017) theoreti-
cal models, the surface oxygen in the stellar atmospheres maybe
modiﬁed during the AGB stage in two ways:

– oxygen in the stellar atmosphere can be enriched by the
Third Dredge Up (TDU) which may occur in 2 Gyr old
stars, with masses between 1.5 − 3M(cid:12), and metallicity range
[−0.5 : 0.0]. In the case of the M31 disc low extinction PNe,
which are 4.5 Gyr and older, with low mass M∗ < 1.25M(cid:12)
(see Paper II), their measured oxygen abundance are free of
alterations from PAGB evolution, and TDU in particular.
– oxygen can be depleted by hot bottom burning (HBB) which
occurs in M∗ > 3.5M(cid:12) progenitors during the AGB phase. In
Paper IV (see their Appendix D), we found that the contribu-
tion to the M31 disc PN sample from very young (<300 Myr
old) massive (M > 3.5M(cid:12)) stars is negligible, therefore there
is no evidence for oxygen depletion in the current M31 disc
high extinction PN sample.

In summary, the current sample of low extinction PNe in the
M31 disc are too old and of low masses for TDU to occur, while
there is no evidence for the presence of very young (300 Myr)
massive (> 3.5M(cid:12)) PNe in the current high extinction PNe sam-
ple in M31, which may be aﬀected by oxygen depletion. We
refer to Appendix A for more in depth discussion of oxygen and
argon abundances in PNe.

Diﬀerently from oxygen, argon is known to be invariant dur-
ing the AGB evolution (Delgado-Inglada et al. 2014; García-
Hernández et al. 2016; Ventura et al. 2017). Given the absence
of oxygen modiﬁcations due to PAGB eﬀects in the current M31
disc PNe sample, in what follow we then proceed to use the PN
oxygen and argon abundances to study the chemical properties
of the ISM at the time the PN stellar progeny were formed.

2.3. Oxygen and argon radial gradients for thin and thicker

disc in M31

In Paper IV, we measured two distinct abundance distributions
for the oxygen and argon, for the thin and thicker disc in M31.
The mean value of the oxygen abundance for the thin disc, <
12 + (O/H) >high−ext= 8.57 ± 0.03, is higher than that of the
thicker disc, < 12 + (O/H) >low−ext.= 8.48 ± 0.02, although both
distributions have large standard deviation values. Same trend
for the mean values of the argon abundance: the argon abundance
of the thin disc, < 12 + (Ar/H) >high−ext= 6.32 ± 0.03, is higher
than that of the thicker disc, < 12 + (O/H) >low−ext= 6.25 ± 0.02.
When the two abundance distributions are compared in pairs,
the two-sample Anderson-Darling test rejects the null hypothesis
that the two distributions of each element are drawn from the
same, underlying, distribution. Hence the two discs in M31 are
chemically distinct in oxygen abundance distribution and argon
abundance distribution.

Regarding the abundance gradient with radius, in Paper IV
we ﬁnd a steeper negative radial gradient for the oxygen abun-
dance for the thin disc, (∆(O/H)/∆R)high−ext = −0.013 ± 0.006
dex/kpc, which is consistent with that measured for the HII re-
gions (Zurita & Bresolin 2012). Paper IV also measured a near-
ﬂat and slightly positive radial gradient for the oxygen abun-
dance of the thicker disc, (∆(O/H)/∆R)low−ext = 0.06 ± 0.003
dex/kpc. The measured radial gradients for the argon abun-
dance are (∆(Ar/H)/∆R)high−ext = −0.018 ± 0.006 dex/kpc and
(∆(O/H)/∆R)high−ext = −0.05 ± 0.003 dex/kpc respectively. The
results of Paper IV are consistent with results of previous studies
(Sanders et al. 2012; Kwitter et al. 2012; Peña & Flores-Durán
2019), whose oxygen gradient measurements were dominated
by the more numerous low-extinction PNe associated with the
thicker disc. We refer to Paper IV for a more extensive compar-
ison of these radial gradients with those of the MW and other
spirals.

2.4. Radial gradients of the log(O/Ar) values

Oxygen and argon abundances are reliably measured in the M31
PNe (see Section 2.2, Appendix A and Paper IV). Since PNe
evolve from parent stellar populations covering a range of ages,
their log(O/Ar) ratios probe the ISM conditions at the diﬀer-

3. Oxygen vs argon as tracers of the enrichment

history in the M 31 discs

The star-formation history of a galaxy leaves chemical im-
prints in its ISM through enrichment with diﬀerent elements.
The information of the ISM chemical conditions at the time
of birth of a star is encoded in its element abundances. While
both argon and oxygen are produced from core-collapse super-
novae, argon is additionally produced by Type-Ia supernovae
(Kobayashi et al. 2020a,b). Thus even though both argon and
oxygen are α-elements, they do not have lockstep behavior and
the star-formation histories of parent stellar populations will im-
print information on the log(O/Ar) vs. argon abundance, 12 +
log(Ar/H), distribution of stars with diﬀerent ages.

3.1. M 31 PNe distribution of the in the log(O/Ar) vs. 12

log(Ar/H) plane

The left panel of Figure 2 shows the oxygen-to-argon abun-
dance ratio, log(O/Ar), vs. 12+log(Ar/H) for all the M 31 PNe.
In order to identify the general trend in the log(O/Ar) vs. ar-
gon abundance, we adopt the following procedure. We divide
the high- and low- extinction PNe in bins of argon abundance,

(blue) and low-extinction (red) PNe. The middle panel displays three

ent epochs of their birth, and thus provide important constraints
for the chemical evolution models of the ISM (see review by
Nomoto et al. 2013 and work by Kobayashi et al. 2020a).

In M31 we identiﬁed three population of tracers in three dif-
ferent age ranges. The HII regions are tracing the chemistry of
the ∼ 300 Myr young stellar population, while the high extinc-
tion PNe, which trace the thin disc of M 31, have ages about
2.5 Gyrs or younger. The low-extinction PNe that are associated
with the thicker disc of M 31, are 4.5 Gyrs or older; see Paper II
and Paper IV for further details.

Figure 1 shows the galactocentric radial distribution of the
log(O/Ar) values for HII regions1 (upper panel), high-extinction
PNe (middle panel) and low-extinction (lower panel) PN sam-
ples, in the RGC = 2–30 kpc radial range. Parameters of linear
ﬁts are also noted in Table 1. We ﬁnd a negative radial gra-
dient for the HII regions, with relatively large error bars. For
the low-extinction PNe, we determine a slightly positive radial
gradient, with a mixture of high and low log(O/Ar) values at
any radius over the 2 − 20 kpc radial range of the disc. For

distributions in three radial regions. Within RGC < 14 kpc,
< log(O/Ar) >= 2.28 ± 0.05 with a slightly negative radial
gradient. In the RGC > 18 kpc outer region < log(O/Ar) >=
2.62 ± 0.28 with a negative radial gradient as for the inner re-
gion. In the intermediate radial range 14−18 kpc, which includes
the most active star forming region in the M31 disc (Kang et al.
2009), the log(O/Ar) values have a wide spread, including the
largest inferred values (> 2.5) for the PNe in our sample. We dis-
cuss the radial gradients and the constraints from the log(O/Ar)

et al. (2009); Zurita & Bresolin (2012); Esteban et al. (2020)) within
a RGC = 17 kpc radius. Because HII regions have high internal extinc-
tion, direct detection of the [O iii] 4363 Å emission line may lead to
select preferentially a relatively metal-poorer population.

Fig. 2. [Left] Oxygen-to-argon abundance ratio, log(Ar/O), plotted against argon abundance for the high- (blue) and low- (red) extinction PNe in
M 31. [Right] high- (blue) and low- (red) extinction PNe binned separately as a function of their 12+log(Ar/H) values. For each bin the sigma-
clipped mean log(O/Ar) is plotted as well its error (error bar along the y-axis), see text section 3.1. The error is computed as the error on the mean
log(O/Ar) value added in quadrature to the mean observation error of the PNe which remain in each bin, after the sigma-clipping. Clipped PN
with log(O/Ar) values that are more than 2-sigma beyond the mean values are marked with a lighter shade. Error bars along the x-axis capture
the rms of PNe in each argon abundance bin. Red and blue error-bars parallel to the x-axis indicate the width of the bins in 12+log(Ar/H) for the
low-extinction (red) and high extinction (blue) PN samples.

12+log(Ar/H), such that there are between 8 and 15 PNe in each
bin. The number of PNe in each bin are chosen such that there
are enough PNe in each bin to obtain a reliable dispersion in
log(O/Ar) while covering the entire 12+log(Ar/H) range with
as many bins as possible. The number of PNe in each bin is
lower for the high-extinction PNe as they are fewer in total2.
We then calculate the mean log(O/Ar) values of PNe in each
12+log(Ar/H) bin after removing the 2 × σ outliers from the
mean3. In Table 2 and Table 3 we provide the mean values of
log(O/Ar) in the 12+log(Ar/H) bins, their standard deviation in
bins, the error on the mean value and mean measurement error
in each bin, for the low and high extinction PNe samples. We
discuss them in turn.

√

In Table 2, we compare the standard deviation with the mean
measurement error in each bin for the low extinction PNe: the
2× the mean measurement error for most
scatter is of order
bins. We thus infer that there is an intrinsic scatter of the mea-
sured log(O/Ar) for the low extinction PN sample, and this scat-
ter is of a similar order of magnitude to the mean error in the
bins. We thus adopt as the error for the log(O/Ar) average value,
in each bin, the error on the mean log(O/Ar) value added in
quadrature to the mean observation error of the PNe, in each
bin.

For the high extinction PNe in Table 3, we notice that the
standard deviation is smaller than the average measured error
for about half of the bins. We still adopt as the error for the
log(O/Ar) average value, in each bin, the error on the mean
log(O/Ar) value added in quadrature to the mean observational
error in each bin, keeping in mind that the dispersion of val-
ues is smaller for 12+log(Ar/H) range 6.21 - 6.32, and for the
larger [Ar/H] abundance values. Finally in the right panel of Fig-

2 Note that the bin with the largest argon abundance has fewer mea-
surements (three) for the high-extinction PNe.
3 In practice, we ﬁrst calculate the mean and standard deviation from
all PNe in each bin, then remove those PNe whose log(O/Ar) values are
more than 2 × σ from the mean, and recompute the mean value for the
clipped sample

ure 2, we show the resulting mean log(O/Ar) values in bins of
12+log(Ar/H) with the adopted error bars.

The distribution in the right panel of Figure 2 is clearly
a function of argon abundance, with the highest log(O/Ar)
values ((cid:39) 2.5) at
the lowest measured argon abundance
(12+log(Ar/H)(cid:39) 6.0) and the lowest mean log(O/Ar) measured
value ((cid:39) 2.08) for the most argon abundant (12+log(Ar/H)(cid:39) 7.5)
bin, for the high extinction PNe. We also show the clipped out-
lier PNe individually. They are few in number and do not aﬀect
the general trend.

3.2. Tracing chemical enrichment in the old disc with PN

abundances

We now focus on the distribution of, and trend in, the mean
log(O/Ar) values vs. 12+log(Ar/H) for the low-extinction PNe,
which trace the early evolution. In Figure 3, their values are com-
pared with the evolution tracks for oxygen and argon for the MW
thick and thin discs (Kobayashi et al. 2020a). According to these
models, argon is made in both SN II and SN Ia, with a greater
fraction in SN II than for Fe and a smaller fraction than for oxy-
gen. Therefore the decrease in the log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H)
plane would signal the increase in the SN Ia contribution, which
is indeed shown by the models. In the solar neighborhood, 34%
of Ar is produced from SN Ia by present, see Kobayashi et al.
(2020a). Interestingly, the Kobayashi et al. (2020a) model tracks
for MW thin and thick discs show two knees: the second knee,
at [Ar/H] = −0.5, is caused by the contribution of Type Ia SN,
similarly to that seen in α/Fe vs Fe/H plots as in Hayden et al.
(2015), while the knee at [Ar/H] = −1.2 is caused by the depen-
dency of argon production on the metallicity of core collapsed
Type II SNe.

We ﬁrst compare the log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H) binned
distribution for low-extinction PNe with the chemical evolution
models. The O and Ar abundance distributions of the M31 low-
extinction disc PNe show a possible slightly positive and null
(within the errors) radial gradient, respectively, see Paper IV. In

Fig. 3. log(O/Ar) values for the low-extinction PNe in M31 are binned
as a function of their 12+log(Ar/H) values and shown as red symbols;
for each bin the mean log(O/Ar) is plotted as well as the sigma-clipped
error. The continuum lines reproduce the chemical evolution tracks for
the oxygen and argon elements modelled by Kobayashi et al. (2020a),
for the MW thick disc (magenta) and the solar neighbourhood (dark
blue). The [Ar/H] abundances and [O/Ar] ratios with respect to the solar
values (12 + log(Ar/H)(cid:12) = 6.38 and log(O/Ar)(cid:12) = 2.29). are marked
on the top and right axis, respectively.

turn, the log(O/Ar) distribution has a near constant average val-
ues and similar large scatter over the entire 2-30 kpc range (see
Section 2.4, Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). The measured null radial abun-
dance gradients for the low-extinction PNe and the large and
constant scatter across the entire radial range supports the view
that their distribution in the log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H) plane
is the result of an eﬀective radial mixing of diﬀerent chemical
enrichment tracks over the 2 − 30 kpc radial range. Signiﬁcant
radial mixing of the old stellar population over the entire PHAT
area was also reported by Williams et al. (2017).

In Figure 3,

the log(O/Ar) vs.
the comparison of
12+log(Ar/H) binned distribution for low-extinction PNe with
the Kobayashi et al. (2020a) models shows that the highest
log(O/Ar) at low 12 + log(Ar/H) values for M 31 disc low-
extinction PNe are representative of the stellar population that
forms soon after α elements are produced in core collapse SNs,
from short-lived massive stars. After Type Ia supernovae start
producing additional argon relative to oxygen, the ISM is en-
riched and stars subsequently form with decreasing log(O/Ar)
values at increasing argon abundance (12 + log(Ar/H)). The
same chemical evolution models, following the aforementioned
processes, also show the decreasing trends in the analogous
[α/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plot for stellar abundances, as seen for the MW
(see e.g. Hayden et al. 2015).

In the MW (also recently in UGC 10738; Scott et al. 2021), it
was found that the thick disc is more metal-poor and α-enriched
compared to the thin disc, occupying distinct regions of the
[α/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plot (see e.g. Hayden et al. 2015; Kobayashi
et al. 2020a). The explanation for the α enhancement in the
MW thick disc is that it has had a faster chemical enrichment
timescale than the MW thin disc, with high star-formation eﬃ-
ciency in the thick disc at early times, while the extended star for-
mation in the latter generates higher iron abundance values than
those in the MW thick disc. Figure 3 shows that correspondingly
the MW thin disc also reaches higher Ar abundances than the
thick disc. On the contrary, diﬀerently from the MW thick disc,

evolution tracks of Kobayashi et al. (2020a). The [Ar/H] abundances
and [O/Ar] ratios with respect to the solar values are marked on the top
and right axis, respectively.

the 4.5 Gyr and older thicker disc in M31 reaches higher argon
abundances than the MW thick disc and as high as those reached
by the extended star formation in the Solar neighborhood.

3.3. Fresh infall of gas: oxygen and argon abundances of HII

regions in the M31 disc

A useful insight on the chemical evolution of the M31 discs is
given by the properties of the younger generation of stars with
respect to the older low-extinction PNe in the M31 thicker disc.
We thus explore the log(O/Ar) vs. 12 + log(Ar/H) distribution
(Figure 4) measured for the HII regions in the M 31 thin disc
(see Section 2.4). Similar to the M31 PNe, the HII regions fol-
low a decreasing trend in log(O/Ar) with 12 + log(Ar/H) with a
signiﬁcant scatter. When we compare the HII region log(O/Ar)
distribution with the MW thick/thin chemical enrichment mod-
els, we see that the HII region values do not cluster near the
end of the track for the MW thin disc, at high [Ar/H] val-
ues. At a given argon abundance, their large scatter supports
the hypothesis that their distribution in the log(O/Ar) vs. 12 +
log(Ar/H) plane is due to diﬀerences in present day abundances.
The range of log(O/Ar) values, between 2.15 to 2.6, at argon
abundance 12+log(Ar/H)(cid:39) 6.0 indicates spatial variations of the
abundances in the M31 gas phase of the thin disc, due to diﬀerent
degree of mixing of metal poor gas with the enriched ISM in the
disc, and also with the starburst in the 10 − 17 kpc region (Kang
et al. 2009). The spatial variations are plausibly linked with the
recent production of oxygen in the starburst and rainfall of gas
over the M31 disc, which may be related to the extra planar HI
gas (Westmeier et al. 2008).

3.4. Constraints on the chemical enrichment of the thin disc

in M31 with PN abundances

In this section we investigate the diﬀerences in the chemical en-
richment of the high-extinction PNe in M 31, which are tracing
the kinematically thin disc of M 31 (Paper II), with respect to
the low-extinction older PNe. We note that high-extinction PNe
occupy regions of the log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H) plane that,

4. Constraints on chemical evolution and the

formation history of the M 31 disc

As illustrated in Section 3, galactic chemical evolution models
of the MW thick disc and solar neighbourhood (Kobayashi et al.
2020a) have a near linear decrease of log(Ar/O) values in the
12+log(Ar/H) = 6 – 6.7 range (see Figure 3). Deviations from
a simple linearly decreasing chemical evolution track may be
related to either quenching or a secondary infall of gas onto a
galaxy which then causes a modiﬁcation of the ISM chemical
abundances (see Section 4.2 for details and Matteucci 2021 for
a review).

4.1. Regions of homogeneous chemical evolution in M31

discs

The chemical enrichment models do not include the eﬀects of ra-
dial metallicity gradients. Therefore, as the high-extinction PNe
have i) a steeper argon abundance gradient (Paper IV) and ii)
have distinct behaviour of the log(O/Ar) values in three radial
ranges, as described in Section 2.4, the steps prior to the chem-
ical modeling include the identiﬁcation of the disc regions with
nearly ﬂat log(O/Ar) radial gradients.

In Figure 6 we show the distribution of the high-extinction
PNe in the three radial ranges, inner disc (RGC < 14 kpc) [Left],
starburst region (14 ≤ RGC ≤ 18 kpc) [Middle], and outer disc
(RGC > 18 kpc) [Right], with respect to the low extinction PN
values for the entire M31 disc. While in Section 3.4 the high
extinction PNe have larger log(O/Ar) values than the low extinc-
tion PNe, we ﬁnd that the high extinction, younger, PNe in the
inner disc cluster towards the end, and below, the low extinc-
tion PNe distribution at relatively high [Ar/H], see left panel of
Fig. 6. Considering their younger age, they are consistent with
the chemical evolution only if also there is a dilution of the ISM
by infall of metal poorer gas. In the middle panel of Figure 6,
the high extinction PNe show a large range in argon abundances
for a 2.5 Gyr and younger evolution. Those points on the top of
the low-extinction PNe distribution may be consistent with the
strong starburst located in this disc region (Kang et al. 2009) and
a range of initial gas mixing. In the right panel of Figure 6, the
high log(O/Ar) values at relatively low argon abundances for the
younger high extinction PNe, with respect to the low extinction
PNe distribution, indicate a higher star formation eﬃciency in
those outer regions, i.e. shorter timescales in the thin disc with
respect to the thicker disc, with the progenitor of these younger
PNe being formed mostly out of the less enriched gas.

4.2. Imprint of a secondary gas infall on the oxygen and

argon abundances in the inner (RGC < 14 kpc) M31 thin
disc from a chemical evolution model

To understand the chemical evolution of the younger disc in
M 31 within 14 kpc, we ﬁrst review the arguments available in
the literature used to describe the chemical evolution of the MW
discs. Two infall-model scenarios were proposed to explain the
distribution of the MW stars in the [α/Fe] (or [Mg/Fe]) vs. [Fe/H]
plane, in diﬀerent radial ranges, see models by Grisoni et al.
(2017); Spitoni et al. (2019, 2021). According to these models,
the MW thick disc stars form rapidly with high star-formation
eﬃciency which leads to high [α/Fe] values for its stars. Even-
tually star-formation is suppressed as gas is depleted in the MW
thick disc. After some time (tmax), further infall of gas, either
pristine or pre-enriched, occurs which dilutes the available ISM
and then triggers star-formation, at a lower eﬃciency. This may

Fig. 5. Same as Figure 3 showing the mean log(O/Ar) values of the
high- (blue) and low- (red) extinction PNe but now also showing the
linear ﬁt with uncertainty shaded for the low-extinction sample. For the
high-extinction PNe, the dashed blue line shows a third order polyno-
mial curve which better ﬁts the lower mean log(O/Ar) values of the
high-extinction PNe in the 12+log(Ar/H) = 6.1 − 6.3 range. The [Ar/H]
abundances and [O/Ar] ratios with respect to the solar values are marked
on the top and right axis, respectively.

even if with some overlaps, are somewhat diﬀerent from the low-
extinction PNe, see Figure 2 right plot. We ﬁnd that the decrease
for the mean log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H) is linear for the low-
extinction PNe. The mean log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H) for the
high-extinction PNe are larger than those for the low extinction
PNe in most bins, but for the 12+log(Ar/H) = 6.1 – 6.3 range (3
bins), where they are lower.

We compare the linear ﬁt to the mean log(O/Ar) values in the
12+log(Ar/H) = 6 – 6.7 range, for the high- and low-extinction
PNe in the M 31 disc, and validate them statistically. The high-
and low-extinction PNe can be ﬁtted by linear functions with
a Bayesian Information Criterion4 (BIC; Schwarz 1978) values
of -50.42 and -48.99, respectively. The linear ﬁt to the low-
extinction PNe (slope = −0.54 ± 0.09; intercept = 5.7 ± 0.58)
is the best-ﬁt, see Figure 5, with higher order functions not pro-
ducing better ﬁts (giving higher BIC values instead). A third or-
der polynomial does however provide a better ﬁt to the high-
extinction PNe (BIC=-56.17) as shown in Figure 5, thus validat-
ing the deviation from simple linear decrease.

If both the high- and low-extinction PNe were following the
same enrichment history, the high-extinction PNe, which have
an age of ∼ 2.5 Gyr or younger (Paper II), should populate low
log(O/Ar)- higher argon abundances region of the evolutionary
track, see Section 3.2 and 3.3. The existence of high-extinction
younger PNe with high log(O/Ar) values at relative lower argon
abundances support a secondary infall event with less chemically
evolved gas.

4 It is a criterion for model selection among a ﬁnite set of models based
on bayesian statistics. Overﬁtting may result from adding parameters to
increase the likelihood of a function. BIC introduces a penalty term for
the number of parameters in the model in order to avoid overﬁtting.

lead to the formation of loops in the galactic chemical evolu-
tion tracks in the [α/Fe] (or [Mg/Fe]) vs. [Fe/H] plane (Mat-
teucci 2021). Thin disc stars in the MW are formed initially at a
lower metallicity which then increases with time. In the the MW
thin disc, stars have lower [α/Fe] values than thick disc stars be-
cause of the diminished star formation eﬃciency. The time in-
terval tmax, the amount of accreted gas, and whether the latter is
pristine or pre-enriched, drives the extent of these loops in the
galactic chemical evolution tracks. Larger loops can be present
for larger tmax values (see Figure 14 in Spitoni et al. 2019) and/or
larger amount of pristine gas. The loop also becomes narrower if
the infalling gas is pre-enriched (Spitoni et al. 2021).

As illustrated in Section 3 and 4.1, the oxygen and argon
abundance distribution and ratios for young high extinction PNe
support a secondary event of gas accretion. Hence we construct
new, galactic chemical evolution models for the inner disc re-
gions (RGC < 14 kpc) with two gas inﬂow phases for the M31
disc, using the same chemical evolution code by Kobayashi et al.
(2020a). The models are constrained using the star-formation
history and metallicity distribution function measured for the
M 31 disc within the PHAT footprint (RGC (cid:39) 18 kpc) using
isochrone ﬁtting to the observed RGB stars (Williams et al.
2017). See Appendix B for a detailed illustration of these mod-
els.

In these chemical evolution models, the thicker disc older
stars are formed by the ﬁrst gas inﬂow, with the infall timescale
of 1 Gyr. The SFR of the ﬁrst burst diﬀers in the models though,
with a weaker ﬁrst burst by a factor ≈ 2.5 for the second model,
which is still within the uncertainties of the total star formation
rate vs. age for the entire PHAT footprint, see Williams et al.
(2017) and Appendix B. The star formation rate ceases after 2
Gyr and 3 Gyr, in the ﬁducial and weaker ﬁrst burst model, re-
spectively. The thin disc stars instead are formed by the second
inﬂow, started at 9 Gyr with the infall timescale of 2 Gyr. In the
two models, the SFR for the second burst diﬀers at the 20% level,
with the ﬁducial model having a relatively weaker second burst.
The chemical composition of both gas inﬂows is set to be primor-
dial, which results in the loop in the log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H)
plane. The star formation timescales are 10 Gyr and 2 Gyr for
the thicker and thin disc stars respectively, which means that the
star formation eﬃciency is ﬁve times higher during the thin disc
formation than for the thicker disc. A small amount of gas out-
ﬂow (with the timescale of 5 Gyr) is also included. These new
models are shown in Figure 7 together with the high extinction
PN oxygen and argon measurements for the M31 ISM within
14 kpc, in the log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H) plane, and the low
extinction PNe log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H) measurements over

the entire disc. The list of the relevant parameters for the chemi-
cal evolution models is given in Table B.1.

We discuss the two chemical enrichment tracks in turn. In
Figure 7 [Left], the ﬁducial model described in Appendix B
reaches 12+log(Ar/H) ∼7.25 at lookback time ∼ 5 Gyr ago,
following which the star formation is suppressed in the thick
disc. Infall of primordial gas occurs ∼ 5 Gyr ago; it rapidly
reduces the mean 12+log(Ar/H) value of the ISM and leads
to a second burst of star-formation. At the start of the second
burst of star-formation, prior to supernovae Type-Ia eruption,
the log(O/Ar) value at corresponding lower metallicity increases,
thereby producing the rising part of the loop (Figure 7-[Left]).
The loop turns over once the supernovae Type-Ia eruption kicks
in, leading to a decrease of the log(O/Ar) value with increas-
ing 12+log(Ar/H), over the past ∼4 Gyr. The track reaches
12+log(Ar/H) values (cid:39) 7.2 at present times. The high argon
abundance high extinction PNe are better reproduced by this
ﬁducial model .

In Figure 7 [Right], because of the weaker ﬁrst star forma-
tion, the second model reaches 12+log(Ar/H) ∼6.7 at lookback
time ∼ 5 Gyr ago. With the dilution and loop following a sim-
ilar pattern as for the model in the left panel, the track reaches
12+log(Ar/H) values (cid:39) 6.7 at present times. This chemical evo-
lution model of the ISM in the M 31 thin/thicker disc is in
good agreement with the values traced by the low-extinction PNe
and the loop covers the distribution of the high extinction PNe
log(O/Ar) and 12+log(Ar/H) values ar RGC < 14 kpc. However,
super-solar metallicity values traced by the high-extinction PNe
are not reached in this model, and the model seems to underes-
timate the amount of low-metallicity gas added. Such remaining
discrepancies may be addressed in a future investigation with
more extended chemo-dynamical modelling.

In Figure 8 we show the chemical evolution enrichment track
computed with reference to a burst of star formation from a
gas infall with primordial composition and a timescale of 2 Gyr
to reproduce the chemical enrichment of the thin outer disc, at
RGC > 18 kpc. The lookback time shows the time from the start
of the gas infall. The adopted timescale is even shorter than that
of the MW thick disc, and it is as short as for nearby early-type
galaxies It clearly illustrates the shorter star formation timescale
and the lower argon abundance of the outer thin disc in M31.

Fig. 7. The Figure shows the mean log(O/Ar) values of the low- (red) extinction PNe over the 2-30 kpc radial range, the high- (blue) extinction
PNe within RGC < 14 kpc and the new two-infall chemical evolution model for the M 31 disc (see Section 4.2 for details), coloured by lookback
time: the ﬁducial model on the left and the alternative model with a weaker ﬁrst star formation on the right. The [Ar/H] abundances with respect
to the solar values are marked on the top and right axis, respectively. See Appendix B for more details on the chemical evolution models.

Williams et al. (2017) found that the total stellar mass pro-
duced over the last ∼ 2 Gyr in the M 31 disc is Mstellar ∼
4.5 × 109 M(cid:12), and the present day total mass of HI gas in the
M 31 disc is MHI = 4.23 × 109 M(cid:12) (Chemin et al. 2009) . Thus,
prior to the burst of star-formation ∼2.5 Gyr ago (Bernard et al.
2015; Williams et al. 2017), a gas mass of Mgas,2 Gyr (cid:39) 9×109 M(cid:12)
must have been available in the M 31 disc. This amount is much
larger than the estimated amount brought in by the merging satel-
lite. Thus residual gas had to be still present in the pre-merger
M 31 disc, which was then diluted by ∆[Ar/H] (cid:39) −0.5 dex as
observed in the argon abundance distribution. The high extinc-
tion PNe were formed out of this diluted ISM within 14 kpc, as
illustrated in Figure 7, and mostly from satellite gas at RGC > 18
kpc, see Figure 8 .

From the mass-metallicity relation (e.g. Zahid et al. 2017),
the gas from the merging satellite galaxy would be pre-enriched,
but at lower metallicity values than the ISM of the M31 pre-
merger disc. A galaxy of mass equal to Msat is expected to have
a metallicity ∼ −0.5 dex. The metallicity distribution of the RGB
stars in the GSS from Conn et al. (2016), and Cohen et al. (2018)
provide evidence for a metal poor population of stars with [Fe/H]
in the range [−1.0 : −0.2] dex. Then a second infall of gas re-
lated to the wet merger of the satellite onto the M31 disc would
dilute the previously enriched ISM in the M31 pre-merger disc.
The star burst triggered by the newly acquired gas would repro-
duce the lower [Ar/H] values and the log(O/Ar) distribution of
the high-extinction PNe, as discussed in Section 4.2. The lower
metallicity of the gas in the satellite, estimated either from the
mass-metallicity relation or the observation of the GSS stars, is
consistent with extent of the “loop” towards lower [Ar/H] abun-
dances in the chemical evolution models shown in Figure 7.

6. Conclusions

We use the largest sample of PNe in the M 31 disc with oxygen
and argon measurements from Paper IV, as well as archival mea-
surements of these elements for HII regions. We compare their
distributions with chemical evolution models for the MW thick

5. Possible gas content of the merging satellite in

the M 31 disc

From the age-velocity dispersion relation in the 14-17 kpc and
17-20 kpc, in Paper II we constrained the baryonic mass of the
satellite that merged with the M31 disc. The estimated merger
mass ratio from the age-velocity dispersion relation is 1 : 5
(Hopkins et al. 2008, 2009), hence the baryonic mass of the
satellite Msat = 1.4 × 1010 M(cid:12). Adopting the best-ﬁt galaxy gas-
fraction to galaxy stellar mass relation (Díaz-García & Knapen
2020), the estimated gas fraction for the satellite would then be
∼19% , with a total mass in gas of MHI,sat = 2.8 × 109 M(cid:12). We
can compare the estimated gas mass brought in from the satellite
with the i) mass in stars formed during the last 4.5 Gyr and ii)
the amount of neutral HI still detected in the M31 disc.

clusions are that the log(O/Ar) vs. argon abundance distributions
for the nebular emissions of the stellar evolution phases (e.g. HII
regions and PNe) are valid alternatives to the [α/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]
diagrams that have been widely used to constrain the star forma-
tion eﬃciency in the MW. By using this new approach, we de-
termined a diﬀerent chemical evolution history for the thin and
thicker discs in the Andromeda galaxy, with the thin disc in M31
having been aﬀected by a wet merger. In detail, our conclusions
can be further illustrated as follows:
– The oxygen-to-argon ratio, log(O/Ar), values of PNe are
high at low argon abundances and monotonically decrease
to lower values at higher argon abundances, consistent with
predictions of the ISM properties from galactic chemical
evolution models. This is the ﬁrst vivid example that galac-
tic chemical enrichment is imprinted in the log(O/Ar) vs. Ar
plane.

– The log(O/Ar) vs. argon abundance distribution for the low-
extinction, 4.5 Gyr and older, PNe associated with the M 31
thicker disc supports a chemical evolution where the thicker
disc forms from infalling gas with primordial composition at
early times and reaches a high argon abundance similar to
that of the Solar neighborhood in the MW (12+log(Ar/H)(cid:39)
6.7).

– The log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H) distribution for the high-
extinction, 2.5 Gyr and younger, PNe associated with the thin
disc of M31 overlaps with that of the low extinction PNe,
with quantiﬁable diﬀerences. Three regions are identiﬁed in
the M31 disc: inner disc, starburst region and outer disc.
– In the inner disc (RGC < 14 kpc), the high-extinction, 2.5 Gyr
and younger, PNe form after a secondary event with infall of
metal poor gas which mixed with the pre-enriched ISM in
the pre-merger M31 disc. This is in agreement with the two-
infall galactic chemical evolution model described in Sec-
tion 4.2 and Appendix B. In the starburst region (14 ≤ RGC ≤
18 kpc), the high-extinction, 2.5 Gyr and younger, PNe dis-
play a range of initial gas mixing and high log(O/Ar) values,
consistent with the strong starburst located in this region of
the M31 disc (see Kang et al. 2009). In the RGC > 18 outer
disc, the high extinction PNe progeny are formed mostly in a
burst of star formation (cid:39) 2 Gyr ago from satellite less chem-
ically enriched gas.

– The log(O/Ar) vs. 12+log(Ar/H) distribution for the HII re-
gions in M31 has a large scatter at ﬁxed argon abundance
12+log(Ar/H)(cid:39) 6.2. This spread is consistent with spatial
variations and diﬀerent degree of mixing, which is reason-
ably linked to current rainfall of metal poor gas from extra
planar HI, part of which may have also originated from the
satellite.

– In contrast to the chemical enrichment history and structure
of the thin disc in the MW, the thin disc in M 31 is less ra-
dially extended, formed stars more recently and at a higher
star-formation eﬃciency, and had a faster chemical enrich-
ment timescale than the thicker disc in M31.

The next steps of this investigation will explore the kinematical
and chemical abundance properties of the PNe associated with
the substructures in the outer disc and inner halo of M31.

chemical evolution model tracks for the MW are same as in Figure 3.

Appendix A: AGB evolution and possible
dependencies of PN oxygen and argon
abundances on progenitor mass and metallicity

Measured argon abundances in PNe reﬂect the ISM abundance
at the time of their birth as surface argon is invariant during AGB
evolution (Delgado-Inglada et al. 2015; García-Hernández et al.
2016). However, surface oxygen has been found to be modiﬁed
in the AGB phase, particularly in stars with initial mass ≥ 3M(cid:12)
where hot-bottom burning (HBB) may result in an oxygen de-
pletion of up to ∼ 0.2 dex (e.g. García-Hernández et al. 2016;
Ventura et al. 2017). This results in measured PN oxygen abun-
dances lower than their birth values. On the other hand, for PNe
evolving from stars with initial masses of 1−2M(cid:12) and Z< 0.008,
third dredge-up (TDU) eﬀects may result in an oxygen enrich-
ment of up to ∼ 0.3 dex (e.g. García-Hernández et al. 2016; Ven-
tura et al. 2017).

In a small sample of 20 MW PNe, Delgado-Inglada et al.
(2015) had found that oxygen is enriched by up to ∼ 0.3 dex
for intermediate metallicities of 12+(O/H) = 8.2–8.7 for PNe
with Carbon-rich (circumstellar) dust (CRDs), while it is in-
variant in PNe with oxygen-rich (circumstellar) dust (ORDs).
In Paper IV (see their Appendix D for a detailed discussion),
using a larger sample of 101 MW PNe with abundance mea-
surements and dust characterisation compiled by Ventura et al.
(2017) compared to the chemical evolution tracks by Kobayashi
et al. (2020a), we found that both CRDs and ORDs (as well
as PNe with featureless dust) follow the MW stellar evolution
tracks with no oxygen enrichment or depletion relative to argon
abundances. The same can be seen in Figure A.1. However, as
also noted Paper IV, many of the MW PNe with mixed chem-
istry dust (MCDs) that are metal-rich (12 + log(Ar/H) > 6.3)
preferentially have log(O/Ar) values below the model tracks, in-
dicating lower oxygen or oxygen depletion. These MCDs are the
youngest (<300 Myr) most metal-rich PNe in the MW sample
(García-Hernández & Górny 2014).

As such young PNe are expected to exhibit enhanced nitro-
gen abundances based on the AGB evolution models of their pro-
genitors (García-Hernández & Górny 2014; Ventura et al. 2017),
we can check whether any M 31 PN has enhanced nitrogen as

further indication of a very young age and oxygen depletion, if
any.

We measure nitrogen ionic abundances from the [N ii]
6548,6584 Å line ﬂuxes for a sub-sample of 87 M 31 disc PNe
which were observed in 2018 and 2019 with Hectospec at the
MMT. The nitrogen elemental abundance is obtained by using
the ICF from Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014) (the nitrogen abun-
dances for the full sample will be presented in a future publica-
tion). The nitrogen abundances for 7 PNe in the M 31 disc are
also measured by Kwitter et al. (2012) using Cloudy photoioni-
sation models, independent of ICF. Figure A.2 [Top] shows that
the nitrogen abundance measurements of these 7 PNe derived
here are consistent with those of Kwitter et al. (2012), indicating
that the Nitrogen abundance measurements are not dependent
strongly on the adopted ICF.

Figure A.2 [Bottom] shows the log(O/Ar) vs. 12 + log(Ar/H)
distribution of these PNe coloured by their nitrogen-to-argon
abundance ratio, log(N/Ar). Young PNe, possibly aﬀected by
HBB, would show higher values of log(N/Ar) than the general
trend, owing to their expected enhanced nitrogen abundances

Notes. This table summarised the timescales of the two infall models.
The units are in Gyr. The timescales are: the timescales of the infall
(τi), that of star formation (τs), and outﬂow (if there is, τo). The table
lists three epochs that identify the truncation of the ﬁrst infall (at t1), the
onset of the second infall (at t2), and the truncation of the second infall
(at t3), also. See Appendix B for more details.

as well as low log(O/Ar) values due to oxygen depletion. To
obtain the general trend of log(O/Ar) values as a function of
12+log(Ar/H), as in Section 3.1, we divide the PNe in bins
of 12+log(Ar/H) such that there are 10 PNe in each bin (the
bins with the smallest and largest argon abundance have fewer
measurements, ﬁve and two respectively). We then calculate the
mean and standard deviation of the log(O/Ar) values of PNe in
each 12+log(Ar/H) bin, shown as diamonds in Figure A.2 [Bot-
tom]. The PNe with the highest 25-percentile log(N/Ar) values
have a mean oﬀset of 0.02 dex (σoﬀset = 0.11 dex) from the gen-
eral trend, while those with the lowest 75-percentile log(N/Ar)
values have a mean oﬀset of 0.01 dex (σoﬀset = 0.14 dex).
Therefore, the PNe with higher log(N/Ar) values do not prefer-
entially occupy lower log(O/Ar) values below the general trend.
We can thus state that the number of PNe aﬀected by HBB in
our M 31 subsample is very small and does not drive the mea-
sured log(O/Ar) trends. This is consistent with the M 31 low-
and high- extinction PNe having average ages ∼ 4.5 Gyr and
∼ 2.5 Gyr respectively with the bulk of the latter having likely
formed in a burst of star formation ∼2 Gyr ago (Paper II), im-
plying therefore a very small number of PNe with very young
massive progenitors (aﬀected by HBB).

To summarise, we ﬁnd no conclusive evidence of AGB evo-
lution eﬀects with modiﬁcation of the oxygen abundance in the
nebula to be driving the trends in log(O/Ar) vs. 12 + log(Ar/H)
for the M 31 disc PNe studied in this work. Any such eﬀect is
within the measurement errors. We thus conclude the oxygen
abundance measurements for M 31 PNe reﬂect their birth ISM
chemical abundances, within the errors.

Appendix B: Chemical evolution models

Previous works to model thin and thick discs used the frame-
work of classical, one-zone galactic chemical evolution (GCE)
models. Grisoni et al. (2017) favoured a parallel model in which
thin and thick discs form simultaneously. The thin and thick
disc models of the MW in Kobayashi et al. (2020a), which are
plotted in Figures 3 and 4, also follow this approach. The thick
disc stars form with shorter star formation and chemical enrich-
ment timescales than for the thin disc stars, and hence in the
[α/Fe]–[Fe/H] or O/Ar–Ar/H diagrams, the thick disc model ap-
pears above the thin disc model. There is a small number of old
metal-poor stars in the thin disc model. On the other hand, fol-
lowing Chiappini et al. (1997), Spitoni et al. (2019) concluded
that a two-infall model in which the thick disc form before the
thin disc, with a long delay until the second infall, is better. Our
models for M31 inner disc plotted in Figure 7 also assumes two
infalls.

In our two-infall models, it is assumed that two exponential
infalls of primordial gas trigger two star bursts. The star forma-
tion rate is assumed to be proportional to the gas fraction (see
Kobayashi et al. 2020a for the formula). Timescales of the infall
(τi), star formation (τs), and outﬂow (if there is, τo) are deter-
mined separately. In addition three epochs are set for the trunca-
tion of the ﬁrst infall (at t1), the onset of the second infall (at t2),
and the truncation of the second infall (at t3). The IMF slope is
assumed to be invariant (Kroupa IMF with a slope x = 1.3 at the
massive end), so as for calculating the nucleosynthesis yields
(Kobayashi et al. (2020a) for single stars including AGB stars
and core-collapse supernovae, and Kobayashi et al. (2020b) for
Type Ia supernovae) and Type Ia supernova progenitor model
(Kobayashi & Nomoto 2009). Therefore, there are nine free pa-
rameters at maximum. However, it is possible to choose the best
set of parameters if the following observational constrains are
available: the metallicity distribution function (MDF), star for-
mation rates (i.e., ages of stars), and elemental abundance ratios.
We take the observational results from Williams et al. (2017),
whose sample covers the M31 inner disc and we combine them
to our O/Ar–Ar/H relation at 2 ≤ RGC ≤ 14 kpc. Calculating
about 100 GCE models, we found this ﬁducial model (the solid
line in Figure B.1), which shows two similar star bursts with the
same height (panel a). Note that the observational results highly
depends on the input stellar evolution models (open circles for
Padova, triangles for BaSTI, squares for PARSEC, and crosses
for MIST).

The ﬁrst star burst increases the metallicity quickly, which
exceeds the super-solar metallicity at t ∼ 3 Gyr. Then the metal-
licity suddenly decrease by the second infall at t = 9 Gyr, of
which chemical composition is assumed to be primordial. Need-
less to say, with a metal-enhanced infall, the metallicity drop
becomes smaller. During the break of infall (t = 3 to 9 Gyr),
star formation is much suppressed, but the iron abundance keeps
increasing (Figure B.1, panel b) due to the delayed enrichment
from Type Ia supernovae, which is one of the two important fac-
tors to avoid the overproduction of metal-poor stars in the MDF
(the G-dwarf problem, panel c). The other factor is a long infall
timescale. Moderate outﬂow is also included, proportional to the
star formation rate, in order to prevent the metallicity to become
too high. The adopted parameters are summarized in Table B.1.
As discussed, since Ar is also produced by Type Ia supernovae
(Kobayashi et al. 2020b), the [Ar/H] evolution follows well the
[Fe/H] evolution (panel b).

The O/Ar–Ar/H relation is shown in Figure B.1 panel d. The
plateau value is determined from the IMF-weighted yields of
core-collapse supernovae. The decreasing trend is caused by 1)
the knee at 12 + log(Ar/H) = 5.3 caused by the dependency
of argon production on the metallicity of core collapse Type II
SNe, and 2) the delayed enrichment from Type Ia supernovae at
12+log(Ar/H) = 6.0 . A loop is created by the second infall, fol-
lowed by the second star burst. With outﬂow, the loop becomes
larger. The blue dashed line is an alternative model with a weaker
ﬁrst star formation. Although this model produce fewer old stars
in Figure B.1 panel a, it gives a better match in Figure B.1 panel
c and d. Namely the lack of metal-rich low-O/Ar PNe prefers a
weaker ﬁrst star burst.

In our thin disc sample at RGC > 18 kpc, the O/Ar seem to be
higher than these model predictions. This can be explained if the
outer thin disc formed with a shorter star formation timescale,
as in the model plotted in Figure 8. The adopted timescale is
even shorter than the MW thick disc and is as short as for nearby
early-type galaxies.
