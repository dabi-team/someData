ABSTRACT

Repeated  measures  analyses  require  proper  choice  of  the  correlation  model  to  ensure  accurate

inference and optimal efficiency. The 

linear exponent autoregressive

 (LEAR) correlation model

provides a flexible two-parameter correlation structure that accommodates a variety of data types

in  which  the  correlation  within-sampling  unit  decreases  exponentially  in  time  or  space.  The

LEAR  model  subsumes  three  classic  temporal  correlation  structures,  namely  compound

symmetry,  continuous-time  AR(1),  and  MA(1),  while  maintaining  parsimony  and  providing

appealing  statistical  and  computational  properties.  It  also  supplies  a  plausible  correlation

structure  for  power  analyses  across  many  experimental  designs.  However,  no  commonly  used

statistical  packages  provide  a  straightforward  way  to  implement  the  model,  limiting  its  use  to

those  with  the  appropriate  programming  skills.    Here  we  present  a  reparameterization  of  the

LEAR model that allows easily implementing it in standard software for the special case of data

with equally spaced temporal or spatial intervals.

1. Introduction

Repeated measures designs are ubiquitous in scientific research, often being employed to

examine longitudinal, spatial, or spatio-temporal data. Appropriate analysis requires proper

specification of the correlation pattern induced by these experimental designs. For example,

Muller et al. (2007) and Gurka et al. (2011) showed that under-specifying the correlation

structure can severely inflate test size of tests of fixed effects in the general linear mixed model.

Thus valid inference requires enough flexibility of the correlation model to allow reasonable

fidelity to the true pattern. On the other hand, optimal efficiency and the existence of computable

estimates demand a parsimonious parameterization of the correlation pattern. The linear

exponent autoregressive (LEAR) correlation model  is a flexible two-parameter structure that

satisfies these two opposing goals for situations in which the within-sampling unit correlation

decreases exponentially in time or space 

(Simpson et al., 2010) It allows for an attenuation or

. 

acceleration of the exponential decay rate imposed by the commonly used continuous-time

AR(1) structure (also referred to as the exponential model). The LEAR model and its derivatives

are useful in a variety of contexts for data analysis (Simpson et al., 2010; Simpson 2010;

Simpson and Edwards, 2013; Simpson et al., 2014a; Simpson et al., 2014b). The LEAR model

also provides powerful tools for power analyses as noted in the documentation for GLMPOWER

(SAS Institute, 2013), GLIMMPSE (Kreidler et al., 2013,

http://glimmpse.SampleSizeShop.org/), and POWERLIB (Johnson et al., 2009). However, no

commonly used statistical package provides a straightforward way to implement the model,

limiting its use to those with the appropriate programming skills. To address this barrier for the

important special case of data with equally spaced temporal or spatial intervals, we present a

reparameterization of the LEAR model that allows easily implementing it in standard software.

on a given sampling unit would increase with increasing time or distance between measurements,

such patterns are rare; therefore the parameter space is restricted for reasons of practicality. If we

3. Discussion

A reparameterization of the LEAR correlation model allows implementing it in standard software

for  the  special  case  of  equally  spaced  temporal  or  spatial  intervals.  The  reparameterization

provides a powerful tool for repeated measures data and power analysis. It is important to note

that  while  the  LEAR  and  ARMA(1,1)  parameterizations  are  mathematically  equivalent  for  the

special case, there is no guarantee that the two parameterizations will lead to the same estimated

covariance  matrix  given  that  the  computability  of  estimates  can  vary  greatly  with  the

parameterization for nonlinear models such as the LEAR and ARMA(1,1).
