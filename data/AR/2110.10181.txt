ABSTRACT

−

G306.3

0.9 is an asymmetric Galactic supernova remnant (SNR), whose progenitor has been thought
to be a Type Ia supernova (SN), but its high Ca abundance appears inconsistent with the Type Ia
origin. Hoping to uncover the reason for its asymmetry and the origin of this SNR, we performed a
spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopic analysis of XMM-Newton and Chandra observation data. We
divided the SNR into 13 regions and analyzed the spectra using two-temperature models (0.2 keV + 1
keV). Compared to the southwestern regions, the northeastern regions have higher metal abundances
and a lower gas density. This suggests that the asymmetric morphology results from the non-uniform
ambient environment. We found that neither Type Ia nor core-collapse SN models can account for the
abnormally high abundance ratios of Ar/Si, Ca/Si, or the shape of the abundance curve. A comparison
with the Ca-rich transient models suggests that G306.3
0.9 is likely to be the ﬁrst identiﬁed Galactic
“Ca-rich transient” remnant, although the theoretical production of element S is lower. We also
note that the conclusion for the SNR’s origin relies on the measured abundance ratios and existing
nucleosynthesis models. Between two groups of Ca-rich transient explosion models, we prefer the He
shell detonation for an accreting WD, rather than the merger of a white dwarf and a neutron star.

1. INTRODUCTION

Supernovae (SNe), explosions that release a huge
amount of energy, are mainly divided into two classes:
thermonuclear (including Type Ia) and core-collapse
(CC) SNe. Although there is no conclusion on the pro-
cess in which SNe explode, it’s widely accepted that the
progenitor of a Type Ia SN is a white dwarf (WD),
while that of a CC SN is a massive star (e.g., Vink
2012). For several decades, Type Ia SNe have often been
used as a synonym for the thermonuclear SNe (see e.g.,

Corresponding author: Ping Zhou, Yang Chen
pingzhou@nju.edu.cn, ygchen@nju.edu.cn

Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000; Nomoto & Leung 2017,
for recent reviews). However, this idea has been chal-
lenged, after recent SN searches revealing several sub-
classes of thermonuclear SNe, each of which has distin-
guished photometric and spectroscopic properties. The
newly found sub-types include Type Iax SNe (faint),
Super-Chandrasekhar SNe (bright; see Jha et al. 2019
for a review) and so on.

Recently, a new subtype of

thermonuclear SNe
called Ca-rich transient has been discovered in exter-
nal galaxies (Perets et al. 2010; Kawabata et al. 2010;
Kasliwal et al. 2012). They were initially classiﬁed into
Type Ib SNe because of the strong He features in their
optical spectra but were later found to have diﬀerent
characteristics of low luminosity, fast temporal evolu-

tion, large Ca to O line ratios in nebular phase and
show a tendency to occur in the outskirts of galax-
ies.
Such large oﬀsets have been explained by in-
situ low-mass stars or runaway binary mergers (but
see Perets & Beniamini 2021). This group of SNe was
at ﬁrst called “Ca-rich gap transients” because its lu-
minosity lies in the “gap” between novae and ordi-
nary SNe (Kasliwal et al. 2012; Taubenberger 2017).
As more similar transients were reported, the gap has
been populated with these objects and now they are
called “Ca-rich transients” or “Calcium-strong tran-
sients” (Shen et al. 2019).

∼

There have been debates on the origin of the large Ca
to O line ratios. A plausible explanation is that their
ejecta is rich in Ca (e.g.
0.1 M⊙ Ca ejecta estimated
for SN 2005E, Perets et al. 2010). Two promising mod-
els providing large Ca yields have been proposed: i) the
accreted WD Helium shell detonation (Waldman et al.
2011); ii) the merger of a He-rich WD and a neutron
star (NS, Metzger 2012). Another interpretation is that
these transients are “O-poor but Ca-normal” SNe, in-
cluding low-mass stripped CC SNe (e.g. SN 2005cz,
Kawabata et al. 2010) and ultra-stripped CC SNe. The
CC origin was once disfavoured because Ca-rich tran-
sients were generally found in old stellar populations.
However, the discovery of iPTF 15eqv and SN 2019ehk
in star-forming regions might support the CC scenario
(Milisavljevic et al. 2017; De et al. 2021), although a
WD progenitor system cannot be excluded for 2019ehk
(Jacobson-Gal´an et al. 2021). The progenitor of Ca-
rich transients has been increasingly controversial. One
emerging opinion is that there are two subclasses (re-
lated to old or young populations) of Ca-rich transients
(Milisavljevic et al. 2017; De et al. 2021). Enlarging the
small sample of Ca-rich transients or discovering nearby
remnants of this group will be crucial to test diﬀerent
theoretical explanations.

So far, Ca-rich transients have only been observed in
the optical band from external galaxies while the rem-
nants or Galactic cases of this type have not been found.
However, the transient census has shown that the Ca-
15% of the SN Ia rate
rich transient occurrence rate is
∼
(De et al. 2020), which converts to
3 Galactic Ca-rich
transients occurring in the past 4 kyr. It is highly pos-
sible to ﬁnd a Ca-rich SNR among the 300–400 known
SNRs in the Galaxy, which would be the nearest lab of
such an explosion.

∼

The X-ray radiation of supernova remnants (SNRs)
can provide information about the properties of the
SN explosion and the surrounding environment. The
metal abundances of ejecta revealed by X-ray spec-
troscopy can be compared with those predicted by

various SN nucleosynthesis models (see Vink 2017;
Mori et al. 2018, and references therein). Similar ap-
proaches have been used in the data from the Milky Way
Galaxy (e.g., Kobayashi et al. 2020) and Perseus Clus-
ter (Simionescu et al. 2019) for distinguishing explosion
mechanisms and progenitors.

G306.3

0.9 is a Galactic SNR, showing asymmet-
ric morphology in the X-ray, infrared and radio bands
(Reynolds et al. 2013, Combi et al. 2016, hereafter
C16). C16 also suggested that it is a Type Ia SNR based
on an analysis of element abundances and the centroid of
the Fe-K line. Later, Sezer et al. (2017) (hereafter S17)
and Sawada et al. (2019) (hereafter S19) supported its
Type Ia origin based on Suzaku observation. But there
exist diﬀerences in conclusions among the works above.
C16 showed two-component gas with temperatures of
0.2 keV + 1–2 keV, while S17 suggested diﬀerent

0.6 keV + 3 keV. Both studies es-

separated from cool intermediate-mass elements (IMEs)
with longer ionization timescales.

The proposed Type Ia origin of G306.3

0.9, together
with its asymmetric morphology, appears at odds with
the idea that Type Ia SNRs tend to be symmetric. Sta-
tistically, Type Ia SNRs are more symmetric than CC
SNRs in X-ray morphology (Lopez et al. 2011), either
due to a more symmetric explosion process or a more
uniform environment. Nevertheless, a few SNRs with
asymmetric morphologies have also been proposed to
have a Type Ia origin, e.g. SNR 3C397 (Chen et al.
1999; Yamaguchi et al. 2015; Leung & Nomoto 2018;
Mart´ınez-Rodr´ıguez et al. 2020; Ohshiro et al. 2021)
and SNR W49B (Zhou & Vink 2018; Siegel et al. 2020).
It would be of interest to explore if the aspherical mor-
phology resulted from an intrinsically asymmetric Type
Ia explosion or a non-uniform ambient medium.

−

SNR G306.3

0.9 also shows strong Ca lines and un-
usually large Ca abundance in its X-ray spectra, which
has not been well discussed in previous work. The Ca-
rich ejecta property makes it an intriguing target to
search for a connection to the newly found SN group
of Ca-rich transients.

To ﬁnd out the progenitor, we revisited the XMM-
Newton and Chandra observations of SNR G306.3
0.9.
To unveil the origin of the asymmetric morphology, we
performed a spatially resolved spectroscopy using an
adaptive spatial binning method. The data and bin-
ning methods used in this study are described in § 2.
We present in § 3 the details of spectral analysis and

results. In § 4, we discussed the possibility of the SNR
being the ﬁrst Ca-rich transient remnant and Galactic
case found, after comparing the ﬁtting abundances with
models. The paper is closed in § 5 with concluding re-
marks.

2. DATA AND METHODS

2.1. X-ray Data

−

XMM-Newton performed an observation towards
G306.3
0.9 on March 2, 2013 (obs. ID: 0691550101, PI:
Miller, J.), the total exposure time of the MOS1, MOS2
and pn data is 56.8 ks, 56.8 ks and 54.9 ks, respectively,
after removing the periods with proton ﬂares. The Sci-
ence Analysis System (SAS) software (vers. 16.1.0)1,
was used to reproduce data and extract spectra. We also
retrieved and reprocessed two archival Chandra ACIS-S
observation data (obs. ID: 13419, exposure time: 5.04
ks, PI: Miller, J.; obs. ID: 14812, exposure time: 47.7ks,
PI: Miller, J.) using Chandra Interactive Analysis of Ob-
servations (CIAO) software (vers. 4.12)2. Xspec (vers.
12.10.1f)3 was used for spectral analysis based on atomic
data from ATOMDB 3.0.94 and ionization balance cal-
culation from ATOMDB 3.0.7.

2.2. Spectra Extraction and Spatial Binning Method

First, the global X-ray spectra for the SNR were ex-
tracted. The selected source and background regions
are shown in Appendix A. The XMM-Newton image
does not reveal any clear point-like sources, but three
soft sources were shown in the Chandra X-ray image
(C16). We removed these point-like sources in our spec-
tral analysis using three circular regions with a radius of
8′′. The global spectra extracted were binned with the
optimal binning scheme based on the response matrices
(Kaastra & Bleeker 2016). We combined the spectra of
two Chandra observations using addascaspec command
in the ASCA FTOOL5 package, considering the inade-
quate photons from the shorter observations.

Before we perform spatially resolved spectroscopy, we
used the weighted Voronoi tessellations (WVT) method
(Diehl & Statler 2006) to separate the SNR into mul-
tiple regions. WVT is an adaptive spatial binning
method, which allows us to divide X-ray image into re-
gions with the required S/N. By using S/N
∼
4900 photons), we obtained 13 regions from the 0.3 –

8.0 keV pn image, which has the most photons among
the ﬁve sets of data. Besides, WVT tends to produce
circular regions so we adjusted the rim regions manu-
ally so that they could coincide with the SNR. The ﬁnal
region division is shown in Figure 1.

We extracted spectra for all 13 regions, with a similar
method as used for the global spectra. Because the pho-
ton counts in small regions are much lower than that in
the global spectra, MOS1 and MOS2 spectra were also
combined using addascaspec command.

2.3. APEX 12CO (2-1) observation

−

We performed a molecular observation toward
0.9 using the Atacama Pathﬁnder Experiment
G306.3
(APEX) 12-m radio telescope. We observed 12CO and
13CO (2-1) simultaneously in a 9′
9′ region using the
nFLASH receiver. At the frequency of 230 GHz, the
telescope provides a half-power beam width of 29′′, a
main-beam eﬃciency of 68%, and a velocity resolution
of 0.079 km s−1. After resampling the data to a velocity
resolution of 0.5 km s−1, we obtained an average RMS
of 0.16 K/0.14 K for the 12CO/13CO data cube.

×

The observation aimed to explore whether the SNR
is associated with molecular gas. We have not found
clear evidence to support the association. Therefore,
this paper focuses on the X-ray analysis, and only brieﬂy
discusses the the molecular gas along the line-of-sight in
Appendix B.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Spectral Fitting

S19 proposed that there exist separated Fe-rich ejecta
based on the study of Fe-K lines. Therefore we applied a
similar triple thermal component model apec+vnei+vnei
to the global spectra, plus the tbabs absorption model
(Wilms et al. 2000). Here the apec model
is a col-
ionization equilibrium model to describe the
lisional
shock-heated interstellar medium (ISM) with the so-
lar abundance. Two vnei models are used to char-
acterize the shocked ejecta and the hot Fe-rich ejecta

cates the Fe-rich gas). The abundance of Ni was tied
to that of Fe in both vnei components.

per, solar abundances from Asplund et al. (2009) were

tained a line centroid µ = 1.22 keV with a line width
σ = 21 eV, which are consistent with the ﬁtting from
S19. These deﬁcits were also found in a few earlier stud-
ies of other sources, e.g. SNR W28 (Sawada & Koyama
2012), SNR Kes 79 (Zhou et al. 2016) and Capella bi-
nary (Brickhouse et al. 2000). Hence, in all subsequent
spectral ﬁts, a Gaussian line at µ = 1.22 keV with σ =
21 eV was added. Considering that there were not many
hard X-ray photons received and there are not enough
bins on the high energy end of the spectra, especially
after region division, all subsequent ﬁttings including
that for global spectra were based on C-statistic (Cash
1979). Global spectra are shown in Figure 2 and the
best-ﬁt results are shown in Table 1.

and Fe-rich gas, respectively

We also tried to apply the double thermal compo-
nent model apec+vnei similar to C16 and S17, but the
triple component model always returned the better ﬁt
and passed the F-test (with probability < 10−13).

To reveal the spatial variation of the parameters across
the SNR, we analyzed the spectra in 13 regions (see
Figure 1). We ﬁrst tried to ﬁt regional spectra with
3-component models as we did for the global ﬁts. How-
ever, because of the small number of hard X-ray pho-

tons, we could not constrain the ejecta components, es-
pecially the hottest Fe-rich gas that dominates the pho-
tons above 5 keV (see Figure 2 and S19). Therefore, we
ignored the Fe-rich gas and set the photon energy upper
limit at 5.0 keV before ﬁtting the spectra in individual
small regions. We used the vnei model to describe the
ejecta and added the apec to account for the relatively
cool shocked ISM, because the remnant is interacting

consistent with the results of S17, obtained from Suzaku
data, while other regions show best-ﬁt temperature of

results of C16. This is likely due to degeneracy between
the two groups of models in ﬁtting the X-ray spectra,
where we ﬁnd two local minimum points of C-statistic
at both 0.2 keV + 1 keV and 0.6 keV + 3 keV. Figure
3 shows the C-statistic curves of the region 4’s spectra.
The curves of other regional spectra have a similar trend
but in some cases, the 0.6 keV + 3 keV is the minimum
point. Because it is mainly the soft X-ray photons that
suﬀer from absorption, there is a degeneracy between the
cool component temperature kTc and NH. Therefore,
the ﬁtted NH also showed a bimodal distribution.
In
some regions, when the apec component was ﬁtted at
∼
0.6 keV, the ﬁtted temperature of the vnei component
would become unreasonably high.

Considering the facts above, it is reasonable that we
ignored the > 5 keV channels and constrained all re-
gions’ temperature to be around 0.2 + 1 keV, which
agree with the previous global ﬁts.

3.3. Comparisons with Spectral Fit Results of Previous

Studies

∼

The triple-component model ﬁts of global spectra gen-
erally agree with those of S19, with some minor diﬀer-
ences. S19 ﬁxed the temperature of the Fe-rich compo-
nent to 5 keV, while our spectral ﬁt gives a temperature
3 keV. Moreover, S19 used the earlier solar abun-
of
dance table by Anders & Grevesse (1989). These might
cause discrepancies in the best-ﬁt temperature of the
less hot ejecta component, foreground absorption, and
abundances. In this work, the Mg abundance is lower
by 38%, while the S, Ar and Ca abundances are higher
by 21%, 33% and 40%, respectively. The Fe abundances
in the vneih and vneiFe are lower by 37% and 57% than
S19, respectively6.

Our regional spectral ﬁt and C16 show signiﬁcant spa-
tial variations of properties across the SNR, demonstrat-
ing the importance of performing spatial-resolved anal-
ysis. As we divided the SNR into more regions, it is
not easy to make a detailed comparison between the re-
sults of the two studies. Our ﬁts showed ISM component
temperatures consistent with C16, but theirs gave much
more drastic variations in the hot-component temper-
atures and the abundances across the SNR. Moreover,
we obtained much lower metal abundances and also ﬁnd
the highest abundances are in the northeast parts of the
SNR instead of the centrally peaked distribution in C16
(see Figure 4).

3.4. Gas Density, Shock Age and Explosion Energy

S19 has also discussed about this issue, and proposed
the existence of three components in the Suzaku spectra:

The ﬁtting parameter norm (10−14/(4πd2)R nenHdV )
was used for calculations of the mean gas density of each
region, where d is the distance to the SNR, ne and nH
are electron density and H density in each region vol-
ume V , respectively. The distance d was adopted as
20 kpc according to S19. ne = 1.2nH (for fully ion-
ized plasma with solar abundances) was adopted. The
X-ray emission was assumed to come from shell-like vol-
umes. For a uniform density case and a shock com-
pression ratio of 4, mass conservation suggests that the
thickness of the shell ∆R = 1/12R (R is the radius
of the SNR, which has an angular radius of 2.′2). Ev-
ery region was treated approximately as a prism with
a depth of 2(√R2
r2), where r is
the projection distance from the region to the SNR cen-
tre. Based on all the assumptions mentioned above, the
volume of small regions and the gas density can be cal-
culated. As for the double thermal component model,
the two-temperature gas was presumed to ﬁll the whole

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Distance

Reynolds et al. (2013), C16 and S17 assumed the dis-
8 kpc (the ﬁducial distance to the Galactic
tance to be
centre). However, S19 proposed the distance being
20
kpc based on the column density derived from HI 21cm
emission and X-ray analysis.

∼

∼

−

Another method to determine distance is to use
the relation between the radio surface brightness of
SNR Σ and its diameter D, although this method
has a large uncertainty and it is generally accepted
that there are diﬀerent Σ
D relations for SNRs that
−
evolve in diﬀerent environments. The H density for
G306.3
0.9 calculated is not considerably high and
there is no evidence for interaction with a dense molec-
ular cloud as yet, also, no gamma-rays originating from
the hadronic process has been detected (S17). Fur-
thermore, we performed a molecular observation to-
ward the SNR and have not found an interaction be-
tween the SNR and the molecular gas (see Appendix
B). Therefore we applied the observed surface brightness
10−21Wm−2Hz−1sr−1 (Reynolds et al.
Σ1GHz = 1.7

2013) to a Σ

(Pavlovi´c et al. 2013). The result turns out to be 26
kpc, in favour of the distance of 20 kpc from S19.
If
the SNR is in a much denser environment the calcu-
lated distance from a diﬀerent Σ
D relation will be
even longer. Pavlovic et al. (2014) also calculated the
distance to G306.3
D
relation from an updated Galactic SNR sample.

4.2. Progenitor

Global spectral ﬁtting results show overabundances
of various elements, which can be used to reveal the
composition of the ejecta. On the assumptions of the gas
geometry mentioned in Section 3.4, the gas and metal
masses in small regions can be calculated.

We

abundances X

obtain mass-weighted

=
P miXi/ P mi (mi and Xi are the gas mass and the
abundance of element X for the ith region, respectively),
which take into account the asymmetric gas and ejecta
distributions. By comparing abundance ratios X/Si
with various SN models, the progenitor can be identi-
ﬁed. However, the Fe abundances in individual regions
are mainly determined from the Fe-L lines because the
hottest Fe-rich component which has bad spectral qual-
ity above 5 keV has been ignored in regional spectral ﬁt.
The triple-component ﬁts for global spectra (see Figure
2) also showed that part of the Fe-L lines emission might
come from a hotter ejecta component. These mean that
the mass-weighted Fe/Si ratio might have larger uncer-
tainty than that we presented in this paper. Therefore,
the Fe/Si ratio from the global spectra, which still shows
an obvious Fe-Kα line, is also used for comparison. We
also calculated the Fe/Si ratio based on the analysis of
Suzaku observation data in S19, because of the better
spectral quality at around 6.5 keV7. However, the Fe
abundance of the 3rd (hottest) component in S19 still
cannot be well-constrained because the temperature was
not ﬁtted but assumed to be 5 keV. Moreover, the SNR
was treated as uniform due to low spatial resolution of
Suzaku. So this calculated Fe/Si ratio might still be less
reliable than presented.

It should be mentioned that C16, S17 and S19 all com-
pare abundance ratios with various SN models but could
not ﬁnd a perfect match, and then concluded that the
0.9 is a Type Ia SN, mainly based
progenitor of G306.3

−

7 The ﬁtting results of model(c) in S19 which consists of two com-
ponents of Fe with diﬀerent ionization timescales are adopted.
The new calculations are based on the same solar abundance
(Asplund et al. 2009), the same shell-like volume assumptions
with ﬁlling factors taken into account and pressure balance as-
sumption as discussed in section 3.4, instead of the original solar
abundance and assumptions in S19.

on the study of the Fe-Kα line. Here we compared the
results with a larger collection of SN models, as shown
in Table 3.

4.2.1. Core-collapse SNe

We compared the abundance ratios with typical CC
SN models (Sukhbold et al. 2016), as shown in Figure 5.
Before the comparisons, the metals predicted in all SN
models were mixed with 35 M⊙ ISM, the amount of hot
gas calculated in section 3.4 (other masses are tested for
Ca-rich transient models, as stated below). The mix-
ing with ISM is sometimes omitted in studies, which
consider the observed abundances represent the ejecta
composition. However, if the mass of ejecta is small and
the ejecta abundance ratios deviate greatly from solar
abundance, the ISM mixing can cause a great diﬀer-
ence in the ratios, as is the case for Ca-rich transient
discussed below. One should note that the ejecta-ISM
mixing tend to make the abundance ratios closer to 1,
i.e. the solar abundance, which is depicted by the red
dashed line in Figure 5 and 6. However, the mixing will
not change the trend of metal ratios, which means the
trend of ratios will be smoothed but not reversed. For

9

example, the CC SN models in Figure 5 predict abun-
dance ratios of S/Si > Ca/Si (S/Ca > 1), the mixing of
ISM will make S/Si and Ca/Si closer to 1, but cannot
change the relation to S/Si < Ca/Si (S/Ca < 1).

Figure 5 shows that CC SN models fail to explain the
observed high Ca/Si and Ar/Si ratios, although they
explain the S/Si ratios better than Type Ia models (dis-
cussed below).

4.2.2. Thermonuclear SNe:
Normal Type Ia; WD double-detonation

−

We subsequently compared the observed metal ratios
in G306.3
0.9 with thermonuclear SN models in Ta-
ble 3, which include “normal Type Ia” models involving
Chandrasekhar-mass WDs and double-detonation mod-
els for sub-Chandrasekhar-mass WDs. It is noted that
these models cover a large range of parameters and thus
are not necessarily limited to Type Ia SNe.

Figure 5 (b) shows the comparison between abundance
ratios and three-dimensional deﬂagration-detonation
transition (DDT) models for Chandrasekhar-mass WDs
(Seitenzahl et al. 2013). The observed abundance ra-
tios in G306.3
0.9 do not match any of the theoretical
results for Type Ia DDT SNe, which predict too-small
S/Si, Ar/Si, and Ca/Ar ratios. Moreover, the Fe mass
calculated from the global spectral ﬁts is 0.10+0.05
−0.04d2.5
20
M⊙, which is too small for DDT models.

−

We also compared the observed metal pattern with
those predicted by sub-Chandrasekhar models (Figure
5 and Table 3), since recent observations and theoret-
ical work are challenging the MCh scenario.
In these
models, He detonations occur on the accreted He shell
before the mass of WD approaches the Chandrasekhar
limit. Such detonation leads to a second detonation in
the CO core, due to either the strong oblique shock into
the inner core or the converging shock at the other half
of the WD. Hence these sub-MCh models are also called
“double-detonation” models. Sub-Chandrasekhar mod-
els produce a wide mass range of Fe, thus some Fe/Si
ratios can lie within the error bars. Although the Ar/Si
and Ca/Si are over-solar, they are still insuﬃcient, and
even after we remove the dilution of ISM, the Ar/Si ra-
tios still lie far away from the ﬁtting results. The Ca/Si
of “7B” model is slightly larger than the lower limit of er-
ror without ISM mixing, but this model’s Fe production
is deﬁcient and leads to a sub-solar Fe/Si ratio. More-
over, the ratio trend of S/Si > Ar/Si does not match the
ﬁtting results.

Among the SN models in Table 3, CCSN, normal
Type Ia (near-MCh) or WD double-detonation (sub-
MCh) models are not able to account for the high Ca/Si
ratio of this SNR. Furthermore, CCSN and near-MCh
models all show abundance patterns of Ca/Si < 1 and

models are mixed with 35 M⊙ ISM. Diamond, triangle
and square icons with error bars indicate the values from
mass-weighted results, global spectra ﬁts and Sawada et al.

mostly S/Si > Ar/Si > Ca/Si (except for a few cases,
e.g. the 12 M⊙ and 15 M⊙ models by Woosley & Weaver
(1995) show a trend of S/Si < Ar/Si and Ar/Si > Ca/Si,
the 25 M⊙ hypernova model by Nomoto et al. (2006)
shows S/Si > Ar/Si and Ar/Si < Ca/Si). By compar-
ison, this SNR shows just an opposite trend of S/Si <
Ar/Si < Ca/Si. Although there are limited bins around
Ca lines
3.8keV in regional spectra, the global spec-
tral ﬁtting results also show high Ca/Si raito (= 5.50)
and a trend of S/Si < Ar/Si < Ca/Si, consistent with
mass-weight abundance pattern. The peculiar ratios of
Si, S, Ar and Ca cannot be explained by O burning and
incomplete Si burning nucleosynthesis in common super-
novae, but shows more resemblance to that of He burn-
ing, where α-particles react and form elements along the
α-chain, up to 40Ca. In short, the models above are not
able to explain either the Ca/Si or the growth trend.
We need other models that have processes to produce
Ca-rich ejecta.

4.2.3. Peculiar Thermonuclear SNe:
Ca-rich Transients

∼

Recently, a new type of thermonuclear SN called “Ca-
rich transient” has been found in extragalactic systems.
One of its signiﬁcant characteristics is the Ca-rich ejecta
10−1 M⊙.
and the mass of the Ca element may reach
A natural explanation for Ca-rich ejecta is the burning of
He-rich matter and there are two leading nucleosynthesis
models so far: i) the accreted WD He shell detonation
(Waldman et al. 2011); ii) the merger of a He-rich WD
and a NS (Margalit & Metzger 2016; Zenati et al. 2020).
Both models predict very large Ar/Si and Ca/Si ratios
in the ejecta. Nevertheless, because both models involve
0.3 M⊙), the ISM dilution
low-mass ejecta (typically <
∼
can change the values of abundance ratios greatly and
how we approach the dilution will be critical. Figure 6
shows the comparisons with the two models mixed with
various ISM masses.

It had been recognized that He detonation in the
WD accreted shell would always lead to a second det-
onation in the CO core (i.e., double-detonation mod-
els, e.g., Polin et al. 2019; Perets et al. 2019). However,
Waldman et al. (2011) assumed that the second deto-
nation does not happen if the WD mass is low and
the He detonation occurs in the low-density regime, or
the actual axial symmetry is not perfectly aligned. Fig-
ure 6 (a) shows comparisons with the He shell detona-
tion models (one-dimensional models by Waldman et al.
2011 and two-dimensional models by Sim et al. 2012).
Three best-ﬁt models among the total of 14 are shown,
“CO.5HE.3”/“CO.5HE.15” stands for a WD with a 0.5
M⊙ CO core and a 0.3/0.15 M⊙ He shell, and “HeD-S”
corresponds to a 0.45 M⊙ core and a 0.21 M⊙ shell. The

Mg/Si ratio in CO.5HE.3/CO.5HE.15 and Ar/Si ratio
in HeD-S are missing because these models did not pro-
vide the yields of Mg and Ar. Figure 6 shows that, with
30–60 M⊙ of ISM mixed, the theoretical predictions
∼
can generally match the observed metal pattern. More-
over, models all show a trend of S/Si < Ar/Si < Ca/Si,
which is consistent with that in the SNR.

We note that one or two abundance ratios in the SNR
still cannot perfectly match existing Ca-rich transient
models. Firstly, the S productions of CO.5HE.3 and
CO.5HE.15 models are slightly low. As for HeD-S, the
S production is even lower and the S/Si ratio is already
close to the solar abundance. Secondly, because the SNR
spectra shows strong Fe-Kα lines, we should also pay at-
tention to the Fe/Si ratio. CO.5HE.3 and HeD-S models
have Fe ratios that match the spectral results but much
lower S/Si and Ar/Si ratios. Alternatively, CO.5HE.15
matches the IME/Si ratios best, but it produces little
iron-group elements and thus has a Fe/Si ratio close to
1. However, there are many further complications of
the models. A higher density of He layer would lead to
a more complete burning, i.e. a larger mass of 56Ni (de-
cays to 56Fe) and a lower yield of IMEs and 44Ti (decays
to 44Ca). There can also be mixing of C-rich material
into the He-envelope, and a larger mass fraction of C
would lower the mean atomic weight of the α-capture
products, which means more IMEs and less Fe are pro-
duced (Waldman et al. 2011; Sim et al. 2012, and Leung
et al. in prep.). Among the highly diverse outcomes ex-
pected from the He shell detonation, it might be possible
that at certain conditions it can produce the amount of
IMEs and Fe that well explain each abundance ratios of
SNR G306.3

0.9.

Next, we consider the possibility of the merger of a
NS and a WD as the progenitor. In this scenario, a He
WD is tidally disrupted as it approaches the NS com-
panion. The WD debris forms an accretion disc and
the mid-plane temperature would become high enough
for nuclear fusion as the gravitational energy converts
to internal energy (Metzger 2012). The nucleosynthesis
products will be ejected as disc wind, along with a large
fraction of unburnt He. Hence, the production of metal
elements of NS-WD merger is generally lower by an or-
der of magnitude than that of He shell detonation model
(see references in Table 3). Therefore, when we compare
this model with the observed metal abundances, the
mixed ISM mass which allows the theoretical ratios to
lie within the observed error bars is much smaller. The
nucleosynthesis model of Margalit & Metzger (2016) is
shown in Figure 6 (b), where “He Fid” corresponds to
a ﬁducial model of a 0.3 M⊙ WD – 1.2 M⊙ NS merger,
“He Nuc” has the same conﬁgurations as “He Fid” but

with nuclear heating suppressed, and “He Wnd4” has
a larger wind cooling eﬃciency ηw, which corresponds
to the ratio of the launched wind velocities to the local
escape speed. When the mixed ISM mass is small, the
theoretical values can match the ﬁt results, except that
they underpredict the S/Si and Fe/Si ratios. It seems
that the small innermost region of the disc where 56Ni
is synthesized cannot produce suﬃcient Fe to account
for the Fe yields of the SNR. Although the 3D simula-
tions of Bobrick et al. (2021) show that a larger mass of
0.1
the WD donor can increase the yield of Fe (up to
M⊙), a lack of He-rich material in the massive CO/ONe
WDs cannot give the Ca-rich abundance pattern of this
SNR.

∼

The mixed ISM mass is still a parameter adjusted
manually so far. Table 4 shows the ISM mass needed for
mixing, to account for the ﬁtted abundance ratios. The
hot gas component vnei mass is calculated as 34+4
−6d2.5
20
M⊙, from the ﬁtted parameter norm, allowing us to ex-
amine whether enough ISM exists to account for the
dilution. At 20 kpc (Sawada et al. 2019), the hot gas
mass roughly meets the requirement of He shell detona-
tion model. As for 8 kpc (Reynolds et al. 2013, C16,
S17), the hot gas mass turns out to be 3.4+0.5
−0.5 M⊙,
roughly meeting the requirement of the WD+NS model.
It should also be noted that the amount of ISM mixed is
not very certain, it depends on the calculation of the hot
gas mass, which is based on the assumptions of volume
and pressure balance. Moreover, the ejecta might not

be fully mixed with the ISM, and the existence of pure
ejecta might also make the calculations deviate from the
fact. However, based on what we could obtain from the
X-ray analysis, Ca-rich transient models can explain the
abundance ratios of G306.3
0.9 better than any other
models.

−

The Ca-rich transient origin of the SNR can be further
conﬁrmed if any compact remnant is revealed by follow-
up searches. In the He shell detonation scenario, a hot

12

WD can be left if the second detonation does not occur,
while a spin-up NS remains after the NS-WD merger.

There have been other models proposed for Ca-rich
transients, e.g. ultrastripped-envelope CC SNe and tidal
disruption of a WD by an intermediate-mass black hole
(IMBH). Two ultrastripped-envelope CC SNe models
are included in Table 3. However, because they are still
CC SNe in nature and do not have Ca-rich ejecta, their
abundance ratios cannot provide a good ﬁt and thus are
not shown here. Besides, the SNR is more likely asso-
ciated with old stellar populations. The closest promi-
nent infrared object is the G305 star-forming complex
1◦ away. But the com-
(Faimali et al. 2012), which is
plex is located at 4 kpc, which is far below the cur-
rent distance estimation of 20 kpc. Such a distance also
makes the SNR about 350 pc above the Galactic plane,
where is almost outside the thin disc.

∼

Since there is no evidence of an IMBH or a global
cluster (GC) habiting near the SNR and the known Ca-
rich transients are not found near GCs or dwarf galaxies
(Shen et al. 2019), the IMBH-WD model is not consid-
ered.

4.2.4. IMEs and Fe Yields of SNe

−

We stress that the unusually high Ca abundance and
the 1 < S/Si < Ar/Si < Ca/Si and Ca/Si > Fe/Si >
1 patterns of G306.3
0.9 are crucial to inferring its
progenitor. These characteristics are explained better
In normal SNe, Si, S, Ar and Ca are
by He burning.
mainly products of explosive O burning and incomplete
Si burning, and iron-group elements are produced by in-
complete Si burning and nuclear statistical equilibrium
(e.g. Thielemann et al. 1996; Iwamoto et al. 1999). As
for Ca-rich transient, these elements come from He burn-
ing.

Figure 7 shows that Ca/S and Ca/Fe abundance ra-
tios of pure ejecta from the SN models in Table 3. Each
CC, normal Type Ia and sub-Chandrasekhar model is in-
cluded in the ﬁgure except those which did not explore
extended parameter space or were already included and
reﬁned in other literature. He shell detonation and NS-
WD merger for Ca-rich transients were also depicted in
the plot. Because S is over-abundant in mass-weighted
results,
its lines lie near the Ca lines, which makes
the relative ratio less dependent on temperature and
it is also usually included in SN nucleosynthesis stud-
ies, the ratio Ca/S is selected to illustrate the pattern.
The mass-weighted and global ratios are compared with
the models and the results from Sawada et al. (2019)
are also included after the same calculations discussed
above. But again, it should be noted that the mass-
weighted Fe abundance is obtained by ﬁtting the Fe-L

lines with a single shocked ejecta model, while the global
ﬁt and S19 treat the asymmetric SNR as uniform. It can
be seen that while Ca/S of the three diﬀerent ﬁtting re-
sults agree with each other, the Ca/Fe ratios show some
diﬀerences.

As shown in Figure 7, near-MCh Type Ia and CC SNe
occupy the Ca/S < 1 area. Type Ia SNe are Fe factories
and thus gather around the Ca/Fe < 1 corner. The
range for CC SNe is large, from sub-solar to over-solar,
and most points lie around the solar abundance.

As for sub-Chandrasekhar models, the initial con-
ditions such as the mass of the WD core, the ac-
cretion rates, the He detonation conﬁgurations and
the metallicity, could inﬂuence the products. There-
fore, the points of sub-Chandrasekhar models are quite
dispersed and can account for various peculiar tran-
sients (Woosley & Kasen 2011; Leung & Nomoto 2020).
Two of the double-detonation model points, “7B” and
“8HBC” from Woosley & Kasen (2011), are near the ﬁt-
ting results of the SNR. However, the large Ca/Fe ratios
of these two models are mainly due to the low produc-
tions and sub-solar abundances of Fe. The ISM-ejecta
mixed cases can be seen in Figure 5, which shows that
these two models could not match the observed abun-
dance ratios.

Ca-rich transient models provide Ca/Fe> 1 and Ca/S
> 1. Note that the pure ejecta points of Ca-rich tran-
sients lie far away from (1,1) because of the unusually
high Ca production. Yet with ISM mixing taken into
account, the data points would approach the solar abun-
dance point rapidly due to low ejecta mass. In Figure 6,
we use dashed lines to illustrate how the Ca/Fe and
Ca/S ratios change as a function of the mixed ISM mass
(only for a few exempliﬁed Ca-rich transient models).
The ﬁlled boxes with darker colors mark the Ca-rich
transient models mixed with more ISM masses (e.g., 35,
70 M⊙). The dashed lines can pass through the observed
0.9. This means that with a
metal ratios in G306.3
proper amount of ISM mixed, some Ca-rich transient
models could explain observed ratios. And the ﬁlled
boxes fall within the error bars of ﬁtted Ca/Fe ratios
but have higher Ca/S ratios, revealing the problem that
current Ca-rich transient models produce less element S
than that is shown in the SNR.

4.2.5. Disadvantages of NS+WD Merger

One key parameter for Ca-rich transients successfully
explaining the abundances ratios of G306
0.9 is the
amount of ISM mixed with ejecta. The amount of ISM
needed for dilution varies by one order of magnitude be-
tween the He shell detonation and NS-WD merger mod-
els (see Table 4). Hence, the actual distance can help us

subclass of the SNR. Although there still exist uncer-
tainties about the distance, S19 and Σ

suggested the distance to be & 20 kpc (see Section 4.1).
35 M⊙ ISM will dilute the
At such a distance, the
NS+WD merger ejecta so strongly that the theoretical
abundances become too low to account for the observed
values (e.g. the abundances of “He Fid” model become
Mg = 1.00, Si = 1.02, S = 1.06, Ar = 1.51, Ca = 2.02, Fe
= 1.04). In this respect, the He shell detonation model
is preferred over the NS-WD merger.

Using the Sedov-Taylor self-similar solution, the SN
explosion energy is calculated (see Section 3.4): E =

20 erg. One can see that the SNR distance
highly inﬂuences the SN explosion energy. At 8 kpc,
where the ISM mixing requirement of NS-WD merger
models can be satisﬁed, the SN explosion energy would
1049 erg, which is too low for a typ-
be only
ical SN explosion or the 1D NS-WD merger model of
Margalit & Metzger (2016). Although the more sophis-
ticated 2D simulations of Zenati et al. (2019, 2020) ob-
tained similarly low explosion energy of 1048–1049 erg for
NS-CO WD mergers, they showed that the He WD cases

cannot lead to any thermonuclear explosion or mass ejec-
tion. On the contrary, the explosion energy at 20 kpc is
consistent with Ca-rich transient SN 2005E and He shell
detonation models (Perets et al. 2010; Waldman et al.
2011).

Noteworthily, so far Ca-rich transients have been
found at the outskirts of the galaxies. Therefore, a dis-
tance of
0.9 is indeed
a Ca-rich transient SNR.

20 kpc is reasonable if G306.3

Another consideration about the NS-WD merger sce-
nario is the evolution channel and population.
If the
SNR’s progenitor was a NS-WD binary, it was more
likely to be a main-sequence star binary that ﬁnally
evolved into a WD-NS system. As there is no GC found
at around SNR G306.3
0.9, it is diﬃcult to form a NS-
WD binary via binary exchange or NS capture. How-
ever, the binary population synthesis simulations of a
main-sequence star binary evolving into a NS-WD sys-
tem have shown that the rate of NS-WD merger is only
2–6% of the observed Type Ia SNe, while those with a
He WD account for a very small fraction (0.3–1.4%) of
NS-WD mergers (Toonen et al. 2018).

4.2.6. Comparisons with other Type Ia SNRs

14

−

∼

The above discussions on the progenitor are mainly
based on the measured abundance ratios. However, it is
noted that some young Type Ia SNRs also manifest en-
hancements of Ca/Si or Ca/Fe abundance ratios, e.g.
SN 1006 (Uchida et al. 2013), Kepler (Katsuda et al.
2015; Sun & Chen 2019) and N103B (Yamaguchi et al.
2021). The discrepancy between the actual abun-
dances and theoretical results still requires more studies
and convincing explanations. Nevertheless, G306.3-0.9
4.7) than these young
shows a higher Ca/Si ratio (
Type Ia remnants mixed with fewer ISM given the young
ages. With the ISM excluded, G306.3
0.9 would show a
dramatically higher Ca abundance. Besides, one should
be aware that only the outer layers of the ejecta of those
young Ia remnants have been heated to emit X-ray emis-
sion, while the interior ejecta is still of low temperature.
It means that the observed metal abundance ratios can-
not be directly used to compare with SN nucleosynthesis
models unless diﬀerent metal layers are well mixed. Be-
sides, according to Type Ia models (e.g. pure deﬂagra-
tion models by Iwamoto et al. 1999 and DDT models by
Seitenzahl et al. 2013), Fe metals have smaller initial ve-
locities than the lighter elements such as Ca and S and
thus tend to be found in the interior. Therefore, one
would expect to see lower Ca/Fe ratios in these Type
Ia SNRs after the reverse shocks sweep and heat the
innermost Fe ejecta and the free expansion phase ends.
The abundance ratios of mature Type Ia SNRs
with similar ages are also diﬀerent from those of
0.9. Type Ia SNR 3C 397 (Yamaguchi et al.
G306.3
2015; Leung & Nomoto 2018) does not show enhanced
abundance ratios of Ca to other elements Ca/X but has
a large Fe/Ca ratio (Saﬁ-Harb et al. 2005; Ohshiro et al.
2021). W49B has been proposed as a Type Ia SNR (still
under debate) and has a smooth abundance ratio trend
Ca/Si and Ca/Fe . 1 (Zhou & Vink
of S/Si
Ar/Si
2018; Siegel et al. 2020).

∼

∼

The Fe-rich hot ejecta with a shorter ionization
timescale revealed by the global ﬁts and S19 still can-
not be constrained by our spatial resolved study, and its
nature is still unknown. S19 attributed it to the strati-
ﬁed ejecta structure of Type Ia SNe. However, it might
also come from the innermost slow expanding Fe ejecta
in the He shell detonation (Sim et al. 2012). Another
possible origin is the potential second detonation in the
WD core, but the IMEs from the outer He burning still
dominate the emitting ejecta.

We stress that our conclusions for the SNR’s progen-
itor rely on spectral abundance ratios and existing SN
nucleosynthesis models. The abundance pattern given
by our study might be of interest for testing future SN

models (e.g., Leung et al. in preparation; Zenati et al.
in preparation).

4.3. Origin of Asymmetry

−

The X-ray morphology of G306.3

0.9 is asymmetric.
It can be roughly divided into a northeastern dim part
and a southwestern bright part. Accordingly to our
spatially resolved study, the northeastern part of the
SNR has higher Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe abundances, but
lower H density (see Figures 4). A reasonable explana-
tion is the existence of an asymmetric ISM distribution,
with denser ISM in the southwest. The ejecta can be
strongly diluted due to a mixing with a dense medium,
which results in the observed lower metal abundances
in the southwest regions. The shocked dense gas can
also greatly enhance the X-ray ﬂux. Although it does
not necessarily rule out the factor of intrinsic explosion
asymmetry (see e.g., Ferrand et al. 2019; Leung et al.
2021, for application of using explosion asymmetry in
constraining explosion mechanism), at least the ISM en-
vironment plays a signiﬁcant role in the formation of the
asymmetric morphology of SNR G306.3

0.9.

matched models are Ca-rich transient models, despite
that the theoretical element S production is slightly low.

models can explain the unusually high Ar/Si, Ca/Si ra-
tios and the trend of S/Si < Ar/Si < Ca/Si. He shell

APPENDIX

A. SOURCE AND BACKGROUND REGIONS

Figure 8 shows the source regions and background regions used for spectra extraction. Three point-like sources
within the SNR were detected in C16 (from north to south indicated as PS N, PS C and PS S). Hence three circular
regions with radii of 8 arcsec at the same coordinates (PS N: αJ2000.0 = 13h21m59s.2, δJ2000.0 = 63◦32′35′′.1; PS C:
αJ2000.0 = 13h21m49s.9, δJ2000.0 = 63◦33′37′′.2; PS S: αJ2000.0 = 13h21m47s.8, δJ2000.0 = 63◦35′07′′.8) were excluded.
Nearby point-sources in the background region were also excluded.

B. MOLECULAR OBSERVATION

Figure 9 displays the distribution of 12CO (2-1) emission at the local standard of rest (LSR) velocity VLSR =

60–
10 kms−1. Molecular clouds are only found at VLSR
0 kms−1. Assuming a ﬂat Galactic rotation
∼ −
curve (Reid et al. 2014), the former velocity corresponds to a distance of 2.8 kpc or 7.1 kpc, while the latter velocity
correspond to 9.9 kpc.

35 and

−

∼

We have not found clear evidence to support an association between either of these clouds and the SNR. There is no
clear morphology correspondence between them. Moreover, the 12CO lines are narrow (less than a few km s−1) and
fainter than 4 K, implying that these clouds are quiescent, cold, and thus unshocked by the SNR.
