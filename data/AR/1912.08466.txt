ABSTRACT

Context. Emission and absorption features from C-like ions serve as temperature and density diagnostics of astrophysical plasmas.
R-matrix electron-impact excitation data sets for C-like ions in the literature merely cover a few ions, and often only for the ground
conﬁguration.
Aims. Our goal is to obtain level-resolved eﬀective collision strength over a wide temperature range for C-like ions from N ii to Kr xxxi
(i.e., N+ to Kr30+) with a systematic set of R-matrix calculations. We also aim to assess their accuracy.
Methods. For each ion, we included a total of 590 ﬁne-structure levels in both the conﬁguration interaction target and close-coupling
collision expansion. These levels arise from 24 conﬁgurations 2l3nl(cid:48) with n = 2 − 4, l = 0 − 1, and l(cid:48) = 0 − 3 plus the three
conﬁgurations 2s22p5l with l = 0 − 2. The AUTOSTRUCTURE code was used to calculate the target structure. Additionally, the
R-matrix intermediate coupling frame transformation method was used to calculate the collision strengths.
Results. We compare the present results of selected ions with archival databases and results in the literature. The comparison covers
energy levels, transition rates, and eﬀective collision strengths. We illustrate the impact of using the present results on an Ar xiii
density diagnostic for the solar corona. The electron-impact excitation data is archived according to the Atomic Data and Analysis
Structure (ADAS) data class adf04 and will be available in OPEN-ADAS. The data will be incorporated into spectral codes, such as
CHIANTI and SPEX, for plasma diagnostics.

1. Introduction

Emission and absorption features from C-like ions serve as tem-
perature and density diagnostics for various types of astrophys-
ical plasmas such as (Mason et al. 1984; Mao et al. 2017; Del
Zanna, & Mason 2018a). Plasma models built on extensive and
accurate atomic databases are essential to determine plasma pa-
rameters that span several orders of magnitudes in the parame-
ter space. For instance, the density of photoionized outﬂows in
the vinicity of black holes can vary from ∼ 103−5 cm−3 (C iii,
Gabel et al. 2005; Arav et al. 2015) to (cid:38) 106−14 cm−3 (Si ix and
Fe xxi, Miller et al. 2008; King et al. 2012; Mao et al. 2017) .
Currently, the status of level-resolved electron-impact excitation
data of C-like ions is rather poor. Such data are either lacking
or obtained from distorted wave calculations in plasma codes,
which are widely used in the community (Mao et al. 2019).

More accurate R-matrix electron-impact excitation data for
C-like ions are available in the literature, but only for a few ions
and oftentimes only for the ground conﬁguration. This is mainly
because R-matrix calculations are rather computationally expen-
sive. Therefore, R-matrix electron-impact excitation data for C-
like ions are needed.

Griﬃn et al. (1998) introduced the R-matrix intermediate-
coupling frame transformation (ICFT) method, which employs
multi-channel quantum defect theory. The ICFT method ﬁrst
calculates the electron-impact excitation in pure LS -coupling,
transforms into a relativistic coupling
which subsequently,
scheme via the algebraic transformation of the unphysical scat-
tering or reactance matrices. Consequently, the ICFT method

is inherently signiﬁcantly faster than the classic Breit-Pauli R-
matrix (BPRM) method (Berrington et al. 1995), B-spline R-
matrix (BSR) code (Zatsarinny 2006), and Dirac atomic R-
matrix code (DARC1). We refer readers to Fernández-Menchero
et al. (2016), Aggarwal (2017), and Del Zanna et al. (2019) for
recent comparisons among diﬀerent R-matrix methods and the
impact on plasma diagnostics.

In the past few decades, the R-matrix ICFT method has been
used to perform large-scale calculations of electron-impact ex-
citation data for a number of iso-electronic sequences: Liang &
Badnell (2011a, Li-like), Fernández-Menchero et al. (2014a, Be-
like), Liang et al. (2012, B-like), Witthoeft et al. (2007, F-like),
Liang & Badnell (2010, Ne-like), Liang et al. (2009, Na-like),
and Fernández-Menchero et al. (2014b, Mg-like). A review is
presented by Badnell et al. (2016). We note that there are also
other large-scale R-matrix calculations that cover individual ions
in the C-like sequence, for instance, (Ludlow et al. 2010) and
Liang et al. (2011b).

Here we present a systematic set of R-matrix ICFT calcu-
lations of C-like ions from N ii to Kr xxxi (i.e., N+ to Kr30+)
to obtain level-resolved eﬀective collision strengths over a wide
temperature range. Section 2 describes the atomic structure (Sec-
tion 2.1) and collision calculations (Section 2.2). The results are
summarized in Section 3. In Section 4, we present comparisons
between the present results for selected ions and some previous
R-matrix calculations. This is followed by our summary in Sec-
tion 5.

A supplementary package can be found at Zenodo (Mao
2019). This package includes the inputs of the AUTOSTRUC-
TURE and R-matrix ICFT calculations, atomic data from the
present work, the archival database and literature, as well as
scripts used to create the ﬁgures presented in this paper.

2. Method
Following the previous case study of C-like Fe xxi (Fernández-
Menchero et al. 2016), for each ion, we include a total of 590
ﬁne-structure levels (282 terms) in the conﬁguration-interaction
target expansion and close-coupling collision expansion. These
levels (terms) arise from 27 conﬁgurations 2l3nl(cid:48) with n = 2 − 4,
l = 0 − 1, and l(cid:48) = 0 − 3 plus the 3 conﬁgurations 2s22p5l with
l = 0 − 2 (Table 1).

2.1. Structure

We use the AUTOSTRUCTURE code (Badnell 2011) to calcu-
late the target structure. The wave functions are calculated by
diagonalizing the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian (Eissner et al. 1974).
The one-body relativistic terms, mass-velocity, spin-orbit, and
Darwin terms are included perturbatively. The Thomas-Fermi-
Dirac-Amaldi model is used for the electronic potential. We ad-
just the nl-dependent scaling parameters (Nussbaumer, & Storey
1978) in the following procedure without manual re-adjustment
to avoid introducing arbitrary changes across the isoelectronic
sequence. For each ion, we ﬁrst optimize the scaling parameters
of 1s, 2s, and 2p to minimize the equally-weighted sum of all
LS term energies with n = 2 (i.e., Conf. 1–3 in Table 1. Since
then, we ﬁx the obtained scaling parameters of 1s, 2s, and 2p.
Subsequently, we optimize the scaling parameters of 3s, 3p and
3d to minimize the equally-weighted sum of all LS term energies
with n = 3 (Conf. 4–12). We repeat this progressive procedure
for n = 4 (Conf. 13–24) and n = 5 (15 conﬁgurations in total,
including Conf. 25–27 in Table 1). A similar optimization pro-
cedure was also used in Liang et al. (2011b) for instance. The
scaling parameters of the 13 atomic orbitals (1s–5d) listed in Ta-
ble 2 are used for the structure (282 terms and 590 levels arising
from 24 conﬁgurations) and the following collision calculation
for all the ions (Z = 7 − 36) in the sequence.

Since the inner-region R-matrix codes require a unique set
of non-relativistic orthogonal orbitals (Berrington et al. 1995),
we cannot exploit the full power of the general atomic structure
codes. As shown later in Section 4, the atomic structures ob-
tained in the present work show relatively large diﬀerences with
respect to experiment values, especially for the ﬁrst few ions in
the isoelectronic sequence, which require R-matrix calculations
with pseudo-states. In general, this inaccuracy does not signiﬁ-
cantly aﬀect plasma diagnostics using spectroscopically and as-
trophysically important lines (Del Zanna et al. 2019).

2.2. Collision

The R-matrix collision calculation consists of the inner and
outer-region calculations (Burke 2011). The inner-region calcu-
lation is further split into the exchange and non-exchange cal-
culations. Following the previous case study of C-like Fe xxi
(Fernández-Menchero et al. 2016), we include angular momenta
up to 2J = 23 and 2J = 77 for the inner-region exchange
and non-exchange calculation, respectively, for the entire iso-
electronic sequence. For higher angular momenta up to inﬁn-
ity, we use the top-up formula of the Burgess sum rule (Burgess

Article number, page 2 of 17

1974) for dipole allowed transitions, and a geometric series for
the remaining non-forbidden (i.e., non-dipole allowed) transi-
tions (Badnell & Griﬃn 2001a).

The outer-region calculation is split into a ﬁne energy mesh
exchange calculation, a coarse energy mesh exchange calcula-
tion, and a (coarse energy mesh) non-exchange calculation. A
ﬁne energy mesh is used between the ﬁrst and last thresholds
for the outer-region exchange calculation to sample the reso-
nances. With an increasing ionic charge, the number of sampling
points in the ﬁne energy mesh increases from ∼ 3600 for N ii to
∼ 30000 for Kr xxxi to strike the balance between the compu-
tational cost and resonance sampling. Along the iso-electronic
sequence, in the resonance region, the characteristic scattering
energy increases by a factor of z2, with z the ionic charge (such
as z = 3 for O iii and z = 20 for Fe xxi). However, the autoion-
ization width of the resonance remains constant. That is to say,
to resolve the resonance region to the same degree, the step size
of the energy mesh needs to be reduced by a factor of z2 with
increasing z. To avoid unreasonable computation cost of high-z
ions, following Witthoeft et al. (2007), we reduce the step size
of the energy mesh by a factor of z (see also Appendix B).

A coarse energy mesh, with ∼ 1000 points for all the ions
along the iso-electronic sequence is used from the last threshold
up to ∼ 3Ip, where Ip is the ionization potential in units of Ry-
dberg This allows us to determine a smooth background of the
outer-region exchange calculation.

Another coarse energy mesh with ∼ 1400 points for all the
ions along the iso-electronic sequence is used from the ﬁrst
threshold up to ∼ 3Ip for the outer-region non-exchange calcula-
tion. Since this coarse energy mesh covers the resonance region,
it is possible that unresolved resonance(s) appear in the ordi-
nary collision strength of the outer-region non-exchange calcu-
lation. Therefore, post-processing to remove the unresolved res-
onance(s) is necessary.

The eﬀective collision strength (Υi j) for electron-impact ex-
citation is obtained by convolving the ordinary collision strength
(Ωi j) with the Maxwellian velocity distribution:

where E is the kinetic energy of the scattered free electron, k
the Boltzmann constant, and T the electron temperature of the
plasma.

To obtain eﬀective collision strengths at high temperatures,
ordinary collision strengths at high collision energies are re-
quired, which is ineﬃcient to be calculated with the R-matrix
method. Hence, we use AUTOSTRUCTURE to calculate the
inﬁnite-energy Born and radiative dipole limits. Between the
last calculated energy point and the two limits, we interpolate
taking into account the type of transition in the Burgess-Tully
scaled domain (i.e., the quadrature of reduced collision strength
over reduced energy, Burgess & Tully 1992) to complete the
Maxwellian convolution (Equation 1).

3. Results

We obtain R-matrix electron-impact excitation data for the C-
like iso-electronic sequence from N ii to Kr xxxi (i.e., N+ and
Kr30+). Our eﬀective collision strengths cover a wide range of
temperature (z + 1)2(2 × 101, 2 × 106) K. They are to be applied
to astrophysical plasmas in various conditions.

The ordinary collision strengths will be archived in OPEN-
ADAS 2. The eﬀective collision strengths are archived according
to the Atomic Data and Analysis Structure (ADAS) data class
adf04 and will be available in OPEN-ADAS and our UK-APAP
website3. These data will be incorporated into plasma codes like
CHIANTI (Dere et al. 1997, 2019) and SPEX (Kaastra et al.
1996, 2018) for plasma diagnostics.

4. Discussion
We selected four ions O iii, Ne v, Si xi, and Fe xxi across the iso-
electronic sequence to illustrate the quality of our structure and
collision calculation. These ions were selected because detailed
results from archival databases (NIST4, MCHF5, and OPEN-
ADAS) and the literature are available for comparison purposes.
For each ion (Sections 4.1 to 4.4), we ﬁrst compare the en-
ergy levels. Figure 1 illustrates the deviation (in percent) of the
energy levels in archival databases and previous works with re-
spect to the present work. A histogram plot of the data shown
in Figure 1 is also shown in Appendix A. Generally speaking,
the energy levels of the present work agree well ((cid:46) 5%) with
archival databases and previous works for high-charge ions. A
larger deviation ((cid:46) 15%) is found for low-charge ions, in partic-
ular, for some of the lowest lying energy levels.

Transition strengths are also compared. The oscillator
strength ( fi j), which is related to the A-value (i.e., the Einstein
coeﬃcient), is often used,
fi j = mc

where m and e are the rest mass and charge of electron, respec-
tively, c the speed of light, g j and gi the statistical weights of
the upper ( j) and lower (i) levels, respectively, and λi j the wave-
length of the transition i − j.

Figure 2 shows the deviation ∆ log (g f ) of archival databases
and previous studies with respect to the present work. A his-
togram plot of the data shown in Figure 2 is shown in Ap-
pendix A. We limit the comparison to relatively strong transi-
tions with log (g f ) (cid:38) 10−6 from the lowest ﬁve energy levels of
the ground conﬁguration: 2s22p2 (3P0−2,1 D2,1 S 0) as they are
metastable levels. For those weak transitions excluded in our

comparison, log (g f ) might diﬀer by several orders of magni-
tude among archival databases, previous studies, and the present
work. This is often due to the diﬀerent number of conﬁgura-
tion interaction levels included, as well as the method adopted.
Nonetheless, the weak transitions are not expected to signiﬁ-
cantly impact the plasma diagnostics as the ﬁve metastable levels
drive the population of all the other levels in the C-like ions, for
astrophysical plasma.

Subsequently, we compare the collision data for Fe xxi (Sec-
tion 4.1), S xi (Section 4.2), Ne v (Section 4.3), and O iii (Sec-
tion 4.4) with previous R-matrix calculations. Hexbin plots6
(Carr et al. 1987) are used to compare the eﬀective collision
strengths of a large number of transitions. In Section 4.5, we
compare the collision data for Ar xiii with a previous distorted
wave calculation. Finally, we demonstrate the impact on the den-
sity diagnostics using these two data sets of Ar xiii.

We note that all R-matrix calculations (including the present
calculation) without pseudo-states are not converged for the
high-lying levels, both with respect to the N-electron target con-
ﬁguration interaction expansion and the (N + 1)-electron close-
coupling expansion. Here we include conﬁgurations up to n = 4
(24 in total) in addition to three conﬁgurations with n = 5 (Ta-
ble 1). Accordingly, the present eﬀective collision strengths in-
volving energy levels with n ≤ 3 are better converged than those
with n ≥ 4. Future larger-scale R-matrix ICFT calculations or R-
matrix calculations with pseudo-state calculations can improve
the accuracy of transitions involving the high-lying levels, espe-
cially amongst the high-lying levels.

4.1. Fe xxi

The most recent calculation of R-matrix electron-impact ex-
citation data for Fe xxi (or Fe20+) is presented by Fernández-
Menchero et al. (2016, F16 hereafter),
including 590 ﬁne-
structure levels in both the conﬁguration interaction and close-
coupling expansions. We limit our comparison to F16 and refer
readers to F16 for their comparison with other previous calcula-
tions (Aggarwal & Keenan 1999; Butler & Zeippen 2000; Bad-
nell et al. 2001b). Both F16 and the present work use the AU-
TOSTRUCTURE code for the structure calculation. Although

6 To represent the relationship of two large sets of numerical variables,
instead of overlapping data points in a scatter plot, the hexbin plotting
window is split into hexbins, and the number of points per hexbin is
counted and color coded. The supplementary package on Zenodo (Mao
2019) provides scripts to reproduce the hexbin plots presented in this
paper. A simple demo of hexbin plot is also available here.

Fig. 1. Percentage deviations between the present energy levels (horizontal lines in black), the experimental ones (NIST) and other theoretical
values as available in archival databases (MCHF, OPEN-ADAS) and previous works: F16 refers to Fernández-Menchero et al. (2016), E14 refers
to Ekman et al. (2014), L11 refers to Liang et al. (2011b), G00 refers to Griﬃn & Badnell (2000, OPEN-ADAS), and T17 refers to Tayal &
Zatsarinny (2017).

both calculations include 590 ﬁne-structure levels in the conﬁgu-
ration interaction and close-coupling expansions, diﬀerent scal-
ing parameters (data sets A and B in Figure 3) lead to slightly
diﬀerent atomic structures. As shown in the top-left panel of Fig-
ure 1, generally speaking, the energy levels of the present work
and F16 agree within (cid:46) 0.1%. The ﬁrst few levels have a slightly
larger deviation of (cid:46) 0.5%, yet smaller than the (cid:46) 2% deviation
with respect to NIST and (Ekman et al. 2014, E14 hereafter).
Additionally, there is a shift of ∼ 0.3 Ryd between E14 and the
present work (and F16) for the 2s22p3s (3P0).

Similarly, as shown in the top-left panel of Figure 2, tran-
sition strengths agree well among NIST, F16, and the present
work with merely a few exceptions. Larger deviations are found
between E14 and the present work.

The scattering calculations of both the present work and F16
were performed with the R-matrix ICFT method. We remind
the readers that the atomic structures are slightly diﬀerent be-
tween the two calculations. Figure 4 shows the comparison of
the eﬀective collision strengths at relatively high temperatures
(4.41×106 K and 2.20×107 K). There are in total ∼ 1.3−1.4×105
transitions with log(g f ) > −5 in both data sets for all three pan-
els. In the left and middle panels, ∼ 5 − 8%, ∼ 1%, and ∼ 0.1%
have deviation larger than 0.1 dex, 0.3 dex, and 1 dex, respec-

tively. In the right panel, ∼ 3%, ∼ 0.2%, and 0.01% have devia-
tion larger than 0.1 dex, 0.3 dex, and 1 dex, respectively.

In the left and middle panels of Figure 4, the “long island"
in parallel to yet below the diagonal line in red is mainly con-
tributed by transitions involving level #78 (2s2p23s, 3P1) and
#79 (2s2p23d, 5D1). When we use the scaling parameters of F16
(set B) the long island is no longer present (the right panel of Fig-
ure 4). We performed another calculation (set C) with a third set
of scaling parameters7, which has a smaller deviation with re-
spect to the default calculation (set A). This shows that the level
energies, A-values, and eﬀective collision strength in the “long
island" are very sensitive to the scaling parameters of 3s and 3d
(Table 3). When we compare the energies and A-values with re-
spect to CHIANTI and SPEX (Table 3), our default calculation
(A) are comparable in terms of energies, and slightly “better"
than set B yet slightly “worse" than set C in terms of A-values.
At relatively low temperatures, a large deviation is still ob-
served even when we use the scaling parameters of F16 (the mid-
dle panel of Figure 5. There are in total ∼ 1.6 × 105 transitions
with log(g f ) > −5 in both data sets for all three panels. In the

sive optimization procedure described in Section 2.1 but for conﬁgura-
tions with n = 5, we only include the lowest three (instead of 15 in total)
conﬁgurations.

Notes. Data set A is the default of the present work. In data set B, we use the scaling parameters of Fernández-Menchero et al. (2016). In data
set C, we use a third set of scaling parameters (see Figure 3). For CHIANTI, database v9.0 (Dere et al. 2019) is used and 620 energy levels are

et al. 2018) is used and and 1400 energy levels are included for Fe xxi. No information of levels #21 2s2 2p 3s, (3P0), 2s 2p2 3s, (3P1), and
2s 2p2 3d, (5D1) are available in NIST v5.6.1 (Kramida et al. 2018).

left panel, ∼ 20%, ∼ 3%, and ∼ 0.1% have deviation larger than
0.1 dex, 0.3 dex, and 1 dex, respectively. In the middle panel,
∼ 20%, ∼ 2%, and ∼ 0.06% have deviation larger than 0.1 dex,
0.3 dex, and 1 dex, respectively. In the right panel, ∼ 10%, ∼ 1%,
and 0.04% have deviation larger than 0.1 dex, 0.3 dex, and 1 dex,
respectively.

This can be attributed to the diﬀerent ﬁne energy meshes
used for the outer-region exchange calculations. The number of
points of the ﬁne energy mesh in F16 is four times larger than
that of the present work so that resonances are better resolved
in F16. Therefore, we performed another calculation using the
same scaling parameters and the same number of points of the
ﬁne energy mesh as in F16. The comparison of the eﬀective col-
lision strength between this calculation (data set D) and F16 at
8.82 × 104 K is shown in the right panel of Figure 5. The diﬀer-
ence is negligible even toward the low-temperature end. Since
the resonance enhancement is more signiﬁcant at lower temper-
atures, the deviation in the right panel of Figure 4 is smaller than
that in the middle panel of Figure 5.

The remaining deviation in the right panel of Figure 4 is
asymmetric (Υ2 > Υ1). This is attributed to the following two
additional causes.

First, some numerical failures are found in the outer-region
exchange calculation of F16. Several test calculations are per-
formed, however, we were unable to reproduce the numerical
failures. Second, some unresolved resonances (Section 2.2) were
found in the outer-region non-exchange calculation of F16. The
Perl script used by F16 bypassed the routine to remove the unre-
solved resonances.

The above two additional causes explain the remaining devi-
ations in the right panel of Figure 5. Since the numerical failures
and unresolved resonances are present in the resonance region,
eﬀective collision strengths at high temperatures are less aﬀected
(cf. the right panels of Figure 4 and 5).

4.2. S xi

Liang et al. (2011b, L11 hereafter) calculated the electron-
impact excitation data of S xi (or S10+) in a similar approach as
the present work. The conﬁguration interaction among 24 con-
ﬁgurations was used to calculate the structure (see their Table 1
for more details). The lowest 254 ﬁne-structure levels were in-
cluded in the close-coupling expansion and the scattering calcu-
lation. For simplicity, we limit our comparison to L11 and refer
readers to L11 for their comparison with other previous calcula-
tions Bell, & Ramsbottom (2000, R-matrix) and Landi & Bhatia
(2003, distorted wave).

Both L11 and the present work use the AUTOSTRUCTURE
code for the structure calculation. Slightly diﬀerent scaling pa-
rameters are used, yet the energy levels are nearly identical. En-
ergy levels from the present work and L11 agree well with the
NIST and MCHF atomic databases, except for the lowest 20 en-
ergy levels (the top-right panel of Figure 1). As shown in the
top-right panel of Figure 2, transition strengths agree well among
NIST, L11, and the present work with merely a few exceptions.

Both the present work and L11 used the R-matrix ICFT
method for the collisional calculation. For relatively weaker tran-
sitions, the eﬀective collision strengths of L11 are systematically
smaller than those of the present work (Figure 6). There are in
total ∼ 32000 transitions with log(g f ) > −5 in both data sets,
∼ 50 − 80%, ∼ 30 − 50%, and ∼ 10 − 20% have deviation larger
than 0.1 dex, 0.3 dex, and 1 dex, respectively.

Since the present work has a signiﬁcantly larger close-
coupling expansion (590 levels vs. 254 levels), the additional
resonances contribute most to the asymmetric deviation. Similar
results were also found by Fernández-Menchero et al. (Fig. 4 of
2016), where the eﬀective collision strength of Fe xxi as obtained
by two R-matrix ICFT calculations with diﬀerent close-coupling
expansions (564 levels vs. 200 levels) were compared.

scaling parameters of Fernández-Menchero et al. (2016) (Figure 3). The darker the color, the greater number of transitions log10(N). The diagonal
line in red indicates Υ1 = Υ2. The dashed lines in red highlight transitions in the “long island" (see Section 4.1 for more details).

4.3. Ne v

The most recent R-matrix calculation of the electron-impact ex-
citation data of Ne v (or Ne4+) is presented in Griﬃn & Badnell
(2000, G00 hereafter). The calculation had 261 ﬁne-structure
levels in the conﬁguration-interaction expansion and 138 levels
in the close-coupling expansion. Nonetheless, only data for the
lowest 49 levels are archived in OPEN-ADAS.

The energy levels of the present calculation are less accurate
(within ∼ 10 %, the bottom-left panel of Figure 1) compared
to NIST and MCHF databases. G00 performed a single conﬁg-
uration MCHF calculation for their atom structure, their energy
levels are comparable with the present calculation. The transi-
tion strengths also agree well between the present work and G00
(the bottom-left panel of Figure 2).

Both G00 and the present work used the R-matrix ICFT
method for the collision calculation. The eﬀective collision
strengths in G00 had a temperature range of (103, 106) K with
three points (1.00, 2.51 and 6.30) per decade. The present calcu-
lation covers a diﬀerent temperature range of (5×103, 5×107) K
with three points (1.25, 2.50 and 5.00) per decade. We calculate
the eﬀective collision strength of Ne v at the same temperature
points of G00 and show the comparison at at T = 2.51 × 104 K
and 2.51×105 K in Figure 7. We note that the comparison is lim-
ited to eﬀective collision strengths involving the lowest 49 levels
(all the n = 2 levels and about a quarter of the n = 3 levels),
which are archived in OPEN-ADAS. There are in total ∼ 1170
transitions with log(g f ) > −5 in both data sets, ∼ 40 − 50%,
∼ 10%, and ∼ 0.09% have deviation larger than 0.1 dex, 0.3
dex, and 1 dex, respectively. The signiﬁcant and asymmetric de-

viation shown in Figure 6 for S xi is not found here because the
results for the low-lying levels are better converged.

4.4. O iii

The most recent R-matrix calculation of the electron-impact ex-
citation data of O iii (or O2+) is presented by Tayal & Zatsarinny
(2017, T17 hereafter), including 202 ﬁne-structure levels in the
close-coupling expansion. For simplicity, we limit our compar-
ison to T17 and refer readers to T17 for their comparison with
other previous calculations (Storey & Sochi 2015; Palay et al.
2012; Aggarwal & Keenan 1999).

T17 used the non-orthogonal MCHF program for their struc-
ture calculation, leading to a better agreement of the level ener-
gies with respect to the NIST and MCHF atomic databases. As
shown in the bottom-right panel of Figure 1, the level energies of
the present calculation are less accurate (within ∼ 15 %). As for
the transition strength, strong transitions (i.e., log (g f ) (cid:38) 10−1)
agree well among all the calculations and databases. A larger
deviation is found for some of the weaker transitions (Figure 2).
The scattering calculation of T17 utilized B-spline Breit-
Pauli R-matrix (BSR) code (Zatsarinny 2006), where an accu-
rate target description is obtained by taking advantage of term-
dependent orbitals. The eﬀective collision strengths in T17 are
tabulated with a narrower temperature range: 102 K, 5 × 102 K,
103 K, 5×103 K, 104 K, 2×104 K, 4×104 K, 6×104 K, 8×104 K,
and 105 K. The present calculation covers a wider temperature
range of (1.8×103, 1.8×107) K with three points (1.80, 4.50 and
9.00) per decade. We calculate the eﬀective collision strength of

parison at T = 104 K and 8×104 K in Figure 8. There are in total
∼ 19600 transitions with log(g f ) > −5 in both data sets, ∼ 60%,
∼ 20%, and ∼ 1.5% have deviation larger than 0.1 dex, 0.3 dex,
and 1 dex, respectively. The deviation observed is mainly due
to the diﬀerent atomic structures and the diﬀerent sizes of the
close-coupling expansion. The T17 data set is recommended if
it suits the purpose of the user.

4.5. Ar xiii

The collision data of Ar xiii in the latest version of the CHI-
ANTI database (V9.0 Dere et al. 2019) originate from Dere et
al. (1979), where the collision calculation was carried out with
the UCL distorted wave codes for small angular momentum val-
ues of the incoming electron and the Bethe approximation for
large angular momentum values. Figure 9 compares the ordinary
collision strength (Ω) of two transitions from the ground level
as calculated with the present R-matrix codes and the previous
distorted wave calculation. The previous distorted wave calcula-
tion provides a good description of the “background", while the
R-matrix calculation includes resonances that stand above the
background.

It is well known that the presence of the resonances increases
signiﬁcantly the eﬀective collisions strengths for forbidden tran-
sitions, especially at low temperatures, while diﬀerences for the
strong allowed transitions are often small, and mostly dominated

Article number, page 8 of 17

by diﬀerences in the target structure. Figure 10 shows the eﬀec-
tive collision strengths for the two strongest transitions in Ar xiii.
It conﬁrms that the diﬀerences for the allowed transition are mi-
nor, while those for the forbidden transition are about a factor
of (cid:38) 2 at the typical formation temperature of this ion in ioniza-
tion equilibrium (2.8 × 106 K, equivalent to log10 (T/K) = 6.45).
The distorted wave eﬀective collision strengths were obtained
from the CHIANTI database, and are based on the calculations
reported by (D79, Dere et al. 1979).

The forbidden line shown in Figure 10 is one of the two
strong infrared transitions which are currently receiving much
interest in the solar physics community as they are potentially
very useful to measure electron densities and the chemical abun-
dance of Ar, one of the elements for which photospheric abun-
dances are not available. These transitions have never been ob-
served, as they are in a relatively unexplored spectral range;
however, they will be observable by the next-generation 4-
meter DKIST telescope, as discussed in detail by Del Zanna,
& DeLuca (2018b).

The increased eﬀective collision strengths for all the for-
bidden transitions we have obtained with the present calcula-
tions have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on their predicted intensities, even
though the main populating mechanism for these transitions is
cascading from higher levels. To estimate these eﬀects we have
considered three ion models. The ﬁrst has the present eﬀec-
tive collision strengths and A-values, but has the A-values for
the transitions within the ground conﬁguration from Jönsson

GRASP2K calculation and should be very accurate; we note that
the diﬀerences between these two sets of A-values are small (10–
20%). The second is the CHIANTI model, but with the A-values
within the ground conﬁguration from Jönsson et al. (2011). The
third one is the CHIANTI model.

Figure 11 shows the intensity ratio between the main forbid-
den and allowed transitions for Ar xiii, indicating that the cumu-
lative eﬀect of the changes in the eﬀective collision strengths is
to increase the intensity of the forbidden line by up to 40% in the
low-density regime.

5. Summary

We have presented a systematic set of R-matrix intermediate-
coupling frame transfer calculation of C-like ions from N ii to
Kr xxxi (i.e., N+ to Kr30+) to obtain level-resolved eﬀective col-
lision strengths over a wide temperature range. The present cal-
culation is the ﬁrst R-matrix calculation for many ions in the C-
like iso-electronic sequence and an extension/improvement for
several ions, with respect to previous R-matrix calculations.

As we have shown for Ar xiii, the present eﬀective colli-
sion strengths increase signiﬁcantly the predicted intensities of

cus (Smith et al. 2016). For instance, as shown in Kaastra et
al. (2017), Arcus has the capability to measure absorption lines
from the ground and metastable levels of Si ix, which enables us
to constrain the density of the photoionized outﬂows in active
galactic nuclei.

The eﬀective collision strengths are archived according to the
Atomic Data and Analysis Structure (ADAS) data class adf04
and will be available in OPEN-ADAS and our UK-APAP web-
site. These data will be incorporated into plasma codes like CHI-
ANTI (Dere et al. 1997, 2019) and SPEX (Kaastra et al. 1996,
2018) for diagnostics of astrophysical plasmas. We plan to per-
form the similar type of calculations for N-like and O-like iso-
electronic sequences.

Appendix A: Comparison of the structure

calculation in histograms

We present the histograms (Figure A.1) of the energy levels (Fig-
ure 1) for the four selected ions: Fe xxi, S xi, Ne v, and O iii.
Similar histograms (Figure A.2) are presented for log (g f ) (Fig-
ure 2).

Appendix B: Energy resolution of the resonance

region

For the present calculations of the entire iso-electronic sequence
(Section 2.2), our energy resolution of the resonance region is
a factor four times larger (poorer) than that of F16 for Fe xxi.
This “poorer" energy mesh is adequate for low-charge ions like
Si ix. As shown in Figure B.1, we compare the default data set
of the present work (Υ1) and another calculation where we dou-
ble the size of the energy mesh for the outer-region exchange
calculation (Υ2). The diﬀerence is negligible even toward the
low-temperature end. There are in total ∼ 1.4 × 105 transitions
with log(g f ) > −5 in both data sets, ∼ 0.5%, ∼ 0.01%, and 0%
have deviation larger than 0.1 dex, 0.3 dex, and 1 dex, respec-
tively. Thus, the energy mesh used in the present calculation is
ﬁne enough for the low-charge ions.

For high-charge ions like Fe xxi, at higher temperatures (cf.
the middle and right panels of Figure 4), the diﬀerence between
our default data set (A, Υ1) and F16 (Υ2) is mainly due to the
(slightly) diﬀerent atomic structures. At lower temperatures, the
scatter caused by diﬀerent atomic structures is even larger. That
is to say, a “better" atomic structure is the leading concern for
high-charge ions at lower temperatures. A “ﬁner" energy mesh
requires more computation time yet only leads to a minor im-
provement in accuracy.

Fig. A.2. Histogram plots of the comparing log (g f ) in the present work (∆ log (g f ) = 0) with archival databases and previous works. F16 refers
to Fernández-Menchero et al. (2016), E14 refers to Ekman et al. (2014), L11 refers to Liang et al. (2011b), G00 refers to Griﬃn & Badnell

log (g f ) (cid:38) 10−6 from the lowest ﬁve energy levels.

Fig. B.1. Hexbin plots of the comparison of the Si ix (or Si8+) eﬀective collision strengths between the default data set of the present work (Υ1) and
another calculation where we double the size of the energy mesh for the outer-region exchange calculation (Υ2). The eﬀective collision strengths
are compared at T ∼ 8 × 104 K (left), ∼ 1.6 × 106 K (middle), and ∼ 4 × 107 K (right). The darker the color, the greater the number of transitions
log10(N). The diagonal line in red indicates Υ1 = Υ2.
