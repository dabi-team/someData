Abstract

Active-target detectors have the potential to address the diﬃculties associated with the low intensities of ra-
dioactive beams. We have developed an active-target detector, the Notre Dame Cube (ND-Cube), to perform
experiments with radioactive beams produced at TwinSol and to aid in the development of active-target tech-
niques. Various aspects of the ND-Cube and its design were characterized. The ND-Cube was commissioned
with a 7Li beam for measuring 40Ar+7Li fusion reaction cross sections and investigating 7Li(α,α)7Li scattering
events. The ND-Cube will be used to study a range of reactions using light radioactive ions produced at low
energy.

Keywords: active targets, time-projection chambers, gas detectors

1. Introduction

Radioactive ion beam facilities provide unique op-
portunities to access the unexplored nuclear land-
scape [1] and nuclear reactions provide one of the
most important tools for such studies. Radioactive-
ion beams are challenging to produce, with their in-
tensities dropping by orders of magnitude as one moves
away from the valley of stability. One of the main
aims of state-of-the-art detector development is to
obtain a high eﬃciency and luminosity (large target
thickness) for low beam intensities, without sacriﬁc-
ing energy and angular resolution. Active-target de-
tectors address these low beam intensities by increas-
ing overall target thickness and by providing large
angular coverage and low-energy thresholds for de-
tecting particles that would normally be stopped in a
solid target [2]. These properties make active-target
detectors suitable for a large variety of nuclear physics
studies with radioactive beams, which include the

topics of nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics, nu-
clear reactions, and rare-decays [3]. There is an ac-
tive research program investigating these topics at
the Institute for Structure and Nuclear Astrophysics
(ISNAP) at the University of Notre Dame using light
in-ﬂight radioactive beams [4]. These beams are pro-
vided by TwinSol, a pair of superconducting solenoids
that are used as a separator for secondary beams
produced in-ﬂight [5]. To take full advantage of the
available radioactive beams from TwinSol for our sci-
ence program, we have developed the Notre Dame
Cube (ND-Cube) active-target time-projection cham-
ber (TPC). The ND-Cube at TwinSol will be used
for fusion cross-section measurements, direct mea-
surements of (α,p) and (p,α) reactions for nuclear
astrophysics, and resonant scattering and transfer re-
actions for nuclear structure studies. The ND-Cube
will also be used for the development of active-target
detector techniques. This development includes the
testing of new anode pad-plane designs for diﬀerent
Micropattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs) such as the
Micromegas [6, 7] and the Gas Electron Multiplier

(GEM) [8, 9]. Future testing for of novel MPGDs
such as the TIP-HOLE detector [10] will be consid-
ered. In addition to MPGDs, the ND-Cube will be
used to optimize front-end electronics and the full
electronics chain, test trigger schemes, and bench-
mark analysis techniques. There are plans for fu-
ture upgrades of the ND-Cube that include combin-
ing the ND-Cube with auxiliary detectors and the
use of lasers for drift-velocity calibration. In this pa-
per, we provide a detailed description of the ND-Cube
and the ﬁrst results from an in-beam commissioning,
where we measured the cross section of the 7Li +
40Ar fusion reaction and we recorded tracks from a
7Li(α,α) scattering reaction using inverse kinemat-
ics. We also present gas-gain measurements with a
double-layer Thick-GEM (THGEM).

2. Detector Description

The ND-Cube is an active-target time-projection
chamber that has a rectangular geometry. The in-
coming beam enters into the rectangular volume through
a beam window and the electric ﬁeld is in the vertical
direction i.e. perpendicular to the beam axis, result-
ing in the downward drift of the primary ionization
electrons. This is similar to the geometries of other
active-target detectors such as MAYA [11], ACTAR
[12], various MUSIC detectors [13], MSTPC and its
variants [14, 15, 16], and MAIKO [17]. Cylindrical
and rectangular geometries for active-target TPCs
have both advantages and disadvantages which de-
pend on the details of an experiment. One advan-
tage of a rectangular geometry is having the drift
perpendicular to the beam axis can help alleviate
beam-induced space-charge eﬀects which have been
observed when drift direction is along the beam di-
rection [18]. A second advantage is the determination
of the position of a particle along the beam axis is not
dependent on the determination of the drift velocity.
A disadvantage may be the implementation of an in-
ternal geometrical trigger is more diﬃcult due to the
breaking of cylindrical symmetry around the beam
axis.

A drawing of the ND-Cube and photograph of
the ﬁeld cage and Micromegas is shown in Fig. 1.
The ﬁeld cage and anode pad plane are housed in a
cubical vacuum chamber that has inner dimensions of
40 cm × 40 cm × 40 cm. Two ISO 160 ports, one of
which is used as a beam port, are located on the sides
of the chamber and an ISO 200 port is located on the

2

top of the chamber. The anode pad plane inside the
ﬁeld cage deﬁnes the active area of the detector. The
active area is approximately 20 cm × 30 cm × 30
cm. Each major component of the detector will be
described in the sections below.

2.1. Beam Window

The beam window consists a single-piece cylin-
drical design with a 2-cm opening that is centered on
an ISO 160 port plus a thin foil covering the open-
ing. The beam window was designed to also be a
centering ring for the ISO 160 connection. The de-
sign protrudes 6 cm downstream to bring the open-
ing of the beam window closer to the active area.
A thin foil separates the detector gas from the vac-
uum of the beamline and various materials can be
used for the foil including aluminized mylar and para-
aramid of various thicknesses. These materials are
epoxied to the ISO 160 piece thus forming the com-
plete beam window. The edges of the opening are
rounded in order to keep sharp edges from tearing
the thin beam-window material. The diameter of the
entrance has been chosen to maximize the transmis-
sion of large-emittance radioactive beams to the ac-
tive area of ND-Cube while allowing for the use of
thin window foils. We have successfully used 3-µm
aluminized mylar with pressures up to 250 Torr and
12-µ para-aramid up to 1 atm.

2.2. Field Cage

The ﬁeld cage provides the uniform electric ﬁeld
needed for the transport of ionization electrons to the
anode pad plane. The ﬁeld cage is composed of a solid
square cathode plate and 21 square aluminum rings
that are held in place with 1.27 cm (0.5 inch) tall
cylindrical ceramic standoﬀs. The total height of the
ﬁeld cage from cathode to the ﬁrst layer of the MPGD
is 33.3 cm, which deﬁnes the height of the active vol-
ume. A custom high-voltage feedthrough is placed
in the top ISO 200 port and provides high voltage to
the top plate through a spring loaded electrode. Each
ring of the ﬁeld cage is connected by a 20-MΩ resistor
to form a resistor chain. The total resistance of the
resistor chain is 440 MΩ. For typical cathode voltages
from 3.0-7.5 kV, this amounts to a current of 6.8-17.0
µA and a total power dissipation of 0.02-0.13 W. The
top surface of the MPGD is placed at the same height
as the second-to-last ring in the chain. This ring is
biased to the same voltage as the top of the MPGD
and thus ensures a uniform electric ﬁeld down from

the cathode to the MPGD used for the ampliﬁcation
of the ionization electrons.

The electric potential and electric ﬁeld of the ﬁeld
cage was simulated using the ﬁnite-element analysis
program COMSOL [19], to look for regions of high
electric ﬁeld and to use the electric ﬁelds for electron
drift simulations. A plot of the electric potential in
the active volume and the region outside the ﬁeld
cage is shown in Figure 2. The simulated electric
ﬁeld appears to be very uniform for the active region.

the ﬁeld cage using ﬁnite-element analysis program COMSOL.

We have tested the maximum achievable electric
ﬁeld strength for a given gas and gas pressure. For
this test, we used 500 Torr of He:CO2(90:10) gas,
which gives a drift ﬁeld of 287 V/cm (0.57 V/cm/Torr)
with a cathode voltage of −9.5 kV . The higher cath-
ode voltages for a given pressure were limited by
sparking of the gas. The region of sparking needs
to be further investigated, but the ﬁeld cage simula-
tions shows that the region the rings closest to the
cathode and the chamber wall show the highest ﬁeld
strengths. In future iterations of the ﬁeld cage, we
will consider increasing this distance to prevent dis-
charging of the cathode to the chamber walls which
will allow us to achieve higher drift ﬁelds.

2.3. Anode Pad-Plane Design and Primary Electron

Ampliﬁcation

The ND-Cube’s anode pad plane is a printed-
circuit board with conducting pads on the upper sur-
face. The design consists of a tiling of 1008 hexagons.
Each hexagonal pad has a 4 mm side and is 7 mm
across. A picture of the pad-plane tiling as part of
our Micromegas is shown in Fig. 3. The pads were
ﬁnished with an immersion gold process to prevent
the oxidation of the copper layer. The dimensions of
the total active area are 230 mm × 275 mm. The
number of hexagons were chosen to have a ﬁne gran-
ularity and yet maximize the active volume given the

total number of electronic channels that were avail-
able. The pads were routed to a total of nine ﬁne-
pitch connectors on the bottom surface. The anode
pad plane connects to the feed-through board, ZAP
A, through 120-pin cables where the signal is then
routed to the front-end electronics (see Sec. 2.4.1).

We use two diﬀerent MPGDs for the ND-Cube.
The ﬁrst is a Micromegas and the second is a double-
layer thick GEM (THGEM). Our Micromegas was
produced by CEA Saclay and used the anode pad
plane. A micromesh is held in place above the pads
with Kapton pillars that keep a uniform 128 µm gap,
which forms the ampliﬁcation region. The Kapton
pillars holding the mesh can be seen as the small
dots that cover the pad plane (Fig. 3). The double-
layer THGEM, which was produced at CERN, can be
used with a bare anode pad plane or in combination
with a Micromegas to give a dual-stage amplication.
A drawing of the double-layer THGEM is shown in
Fig. 4. The THGEM has three layers of copper con-
ductor separated by insulator. The active region of
the THGEM was matched to the shape of the pads of
the anode pad plane. A photograph of our THGEM
is shown in Fig. 5. The primary electron ampliﬁ-
cation occurs in the regions between the conducting
layers. The total thickness of the THGEM is 1.2 mm,
the holes are 0.5 mm in diameter with a 0.1 mm rim
and 1.0 mm pitch. The outer conductor was given a
Ni/Au ﬁnish. The THGEM is typically mounted 1-2
mm above the Micromegas or bare anode pad plane.

layer THGEM. The α-source setup is shown used for gas-gain
measurements is shown. The drift ﬁeld Edrift and transfer ﬁeld

2.4. Electronics Chain

Once the primary electrons are ampliﬁed, the sig-
nal produced in the MPGD is sent through an elec-
tronics chain processes and records the signal. A
schematic of the electronics chain is shown in Fig-
ure 6. The processing and digitization of the signal
is done by the General Electronics for TPCs (GET),
which is based on Application Speciﬁc Integrated Cir-
cuit (ASIC) technology developed speciﬁcally for TPC
experiments with a large number of channels [20].

2.4.1. Front-end feedthrough: ZAP boards

The signals produced by the MPGD inside the
ND-Cube’s vacuum chamber need to be routed to
the front-end electronics that are outside the detec-
tor. In order to do this for the signals from the 1008
pads, a two-part feedthrough connection based on
printed-circuit boards (PCBs) is used. The ﬁrst PCB
is called the ZAP A and acts as a feedthrough that
connects the pad signals to connectors on the outside
that match the front-end electronics. The ZAP A
also acts as a sealing surface to openings in the vac-
uum chamber for the inner connectors and uses o-ring
seals. The Micromegas or anode pad plane connects
to the ZAP A through nine 120-channel ribbon ca-
bles. The outside of the ZAP A connects directly to
the ZAP B board through 16 72-pin connectors that
are the same type as the front-end card, the ASIC
and ADC (AsAd) board. The ZAP B has a resistor
and capacitor circuit as shown in Fig. 6 that capac-
itively couples the signal to the input of the AsAd
card and and which grounds the anode pads through
the resistor. This circuit uses a 220 pF capacitor
and 100 MΩ resistor. Future iterations of the ZAP
B will allow for implementing a high-voltage bias on
the pads for a larger range of potential diﬀerences
between the micromesh or THGEM and the anode
pad plane. This will enable a more ﬂexible MPGD
ampliﬁcation setup.

2.4.2. Front-End Electronics and Data Acquisition

The signals from the ZAP boards are connected
to the AsAd where each channel is connected to one
of the four onboard ASIC chips, the ASIC for GET
(AGET). Each channel on the AGET has a charge
sensitive preampliﬁer with four gain settings, a shaper
and ampliﬁer, pole-zero correction, discriminators for
the shaped signal, and a switched capacitor array for
digitization of the signal. The signals can be digitized
at rates up to 100 MHz with 12-bit resolution. A total

of four AsAd cards having a capacity of 1024 channels
are used for the 1008 pad signals. Four AsAd cards
are connected to one Concentration Board (CoBo).
The CoBo can control AGET parameters, implement
trigger conditions, and transfer data to the data ac-
quisition computer through the µTCA crate. Com-
munications and data transfer are through the µTCA
backplane and the interface to the data acquisition
computer is through a memory controller (MicroTCA
Carrier Hub (MCH)), which uses a Gigabit ethernet
connection. Control and implementation of the trig-
ger can be performed in CoBo stand-alone mode or
with the MUTANT master trigger logic card. More
details can be found in Ref. [20].

For an experiment, typically one of two diﬀerent
trigger conditions are used. The ﬁrst is an exter-
nally generated trigger, such as a signal from the mi-
cromesh or THGEM, or a multiplicity trigger that is
generated internally from the GET electronics. The
multiplicity trigger is based on the total number of
discriminator signals from individual pads in a cho-
sen time window. Combinations of external and mul-
tiplicity triggers can be used. These can be useful in
situations where the ND-Cube is used with auxiliary
detectors.

3. Vertex Resolution and Energy Resolution

One of the main advantages of active-target detec-
tors is the ability to simultaneously track the beam
and reaction products. Event-by-event tracking of
particles allows for the determination of the reaction
vertex. In the case of active-target detectors where
the pad-plane is perpendicular to the beam axis, the
vertex resolution depends on how well the time of a
charge signal can be converted into a position. This
calibration depends on how well the the electron drift
velocity is known throughout the detector during the
experiment.
In the case of the ND-Cube, the pad
plane is parallel to the beam axis. Since the pad sizes
and distances from the entrance window are known,
this allows for the determination of the absolute po-
sition of the tracks along the ideal beam axis. The
vertex resolution will be on the order of the size of a
pad, but with the aid of tracking algorithms, vertex
resolutions that are better than the size of a pad can
be achieved.

Another important measure of detector perfor-
mance is the total charge resolution of a track. This
translates directly to the resolution of the energy de-

posited by a charged particle in the active region of
our detector. We have performed measurements to
determine the energy resolution from total charge in-
tegration of an α-particle track using a mixed 148Gd
and 241Am α-source. The source had an activity of
2000 Bq. We placed the source above the Micromegas
at a height of 20 cm. The source was not collimated
and faced the direction of the Micromegas. The de-
tector was ﬁlled with P10 gas at a pressure of 400
Torr. At this pressure, the lower energy α-particle
(E = 3.2 MeV) from 148Gd were completely stopped
inside the active area. However, depending on the
direction of the α particle, many α-particles from
241Am escaped the active region and deposited only
part of their energy. The α-particle energy spectrum
is shown in Figure 7. Using the known energy of the
lower-energy peak at 3.2 MeV, the energy resolution
was determined to be 9% FWHM at 3.2 MeV.

4. In-Beam Detector Commissioning Experi-

ment

To test and demonstrate the performance of the
ND-Cube under experimental conditions, the ND-
Cube was commissioned with a 7Li beam. The aim
of this test was to demonstrate the use and the readi-
ness of ND-Cube for future fusion studies, as well
as scattering studies, which have been demonstrated
with other active-target detectors [21, 22]. Here we
report the measurement of 7Li+40Ar fusion cross sec-
tions using P10 (Ar:CH4 (90:10)) gas as a target and

7Li(α, α)7Li using He:CO2(90:10) gas. The 7Li beam
was produced with the FN Van de Graaﬀ accelerator
at the Nuclear Science Laboratory at the University
of Notre Dame. A ∆E-E Si telescope was mounted
upstream of the ND-Cube entrance window to inde-
pendently measure the beam properties. To reduce
the 7Li beam rate in the ND-Cube, two attenuators
were used to reduce the beam intensity to 1000-3000
pps. A Micromegas was used for the electron ampli-
ﬁcation.

4.1. Measurement of 7Li + 40Ar fusion cross sections

To measure the 7Li + 40Ar fusion cross section,
the ND-Cube was ﬁlled with 320 Torr of P10 gas. The

sponds to a drift ﬁeld of 44 V/cm. A 7Li beam with 21
MeV energy entered through the ND-Cube entrance
window. The beam energy and detector pressure were
chosen so the beam stops inside the detector close to
the end of the active region. When a fusion event
occurs, the fusion residue is highly ionizing and has
a very short range. This appears as an abrupt and
sharp peak in the energy loss signal and is the signa-
ture of a fusion event. The top plots in Fig. 8 show
the 2-D projection of a beam track (left) and fusion
event(right) onto the anode pad plane with the beam
entering from the right. A small number of pad sig-
nals are not present due to missing connections the
front-end electronics, but the tracks can clearly be
seen. The fusion event has a shorter track length as
expected. The lower plots in Fig. 8 show the charge
signal for a beam track and fusion event, where this
charge signal is proportional to the energy loss of the
beam and fusion residue. The second signature of the
fusion event, the much larger energy loss of the fusion
residue, can be seen in the magnitude of the charge
peak.

In order to generate a simple and robust trigger
for fusion events, we used the mesh signal from the
Micromegas. This signal can be considered to be
proportional to the sum of all pads as a function of
time. Thus the integrated signal is proportional to
the energy deposited by a track in the active region.
For unreacted 7Li beam particles, this is a well de-
ﬁned energy and thus results in a well deﬁned charge
integration pulse height. Fusion events, due to be-
ing a completely inelastic collision will result in a
smaller Micromegas pulse height. The trigger for fu-
sion events used a single-channel analyzer to accept
events for pulse heights that were smaller than those
corresponding to the beam.

In the oﬄine data analysis, fusion events were
identiﬁed based on a shorter track length and higher
peak charge as shown in Fig. 8. To get the abso-
lute normalization for extracting cross sections, the
beam rate was measured using a down-scaled mesh
signal. Since the beam was stopped inside the detec-
tor, this allowed us to convert the beam track length
into beam energy. The pad plane along the beam axis
was divided into 1.5 cm bins. Each 1.5 cm bin corre-
sponds to the same number of target atoms, but the
energy loss of the beam is diﬀerent in each bin since
it loses more energy the deeper it goes into the detec-
tor. The number of fusion events per 1.5 cm bin was

obtained and the corresponding fusion cross section is
shown in Fig. 9. Here, horizontal error bars represent
the range of the beam energy in each 1.5 cm bin. The
experimental cross sections were compared to optical-
model calculations. The global optical-model param-
eters were taken from Ref. [23], which contains data
for 7Li on a wide range of targets for energies in the
range of 13-153 MeV. The measured cross-sections
show a good agreement within a reasonable range of
energy with optical-model calculations (Fig. 9).

4.2. 7Li + α elastic scattering

Using the same 21 MeV 7Li beam, we have recorded
events from the 7Li(α,α)7Li reaction using inverse
kinematics. This study was aimed at investigating
the eﬀectiveness of the various trigger schemes. The
ND-Cube was ﬁlled with a He:CO2 (90:10) gas mix-
ture at a pressure of 400 Torr. The ﬁeld-cage cathode
high voltage was -9.00 kV, which gave a drift ﬁeld of
256 V/cm. The drift velocity was calculated using
the program Magboltz [24, 25] and found to be 1.1
cm/µs. This drift velocity corresponds to a total drift
time from the cathode to the Micromegas of 36.6 µs.
This should allow for a beam rate on the order of
2 × 105 pps but we limited our maximum beam rate
to about 5000 pps due to the possible limitations of
the data rate in our data acquisition system.

The trigger condition was based on a multiplic-
ity threshold that corresponds to the number of pads
hit in a certain time window. One example of a
scattering event is shown in Fig. 10. To track and
identify the particles from such images, we are de-
veloping tracking algorithms based on the Python-
based hierarchical-clustering algorithm [26] and the
RANSAC algorithm [27]. These algorithms have been
successfully used to track the particles in 3D. We used
the Agglomerative Clustering algorithm for which the
hierarchical clustering uses a bottom up approach.
Each observation starts with its own cluster and clus-
ters are successively merged together. The algorithm
merges a pair of clusters that minimally increase a
given linkage distance. One can either provide the
linkage distance threshold to the algorithm so that
clusters outside this threshold are not merged or one
can deﬁne the number of clusters to be searched for.
This allows the identiﬁcation of diﬀerent clusters where
each cluster corresponds to a distinct particle track.
Once diﬀerent tracks (each as a cluster) are iden-
tiﬁed, the data points of each track are passed to
the RANSAC algorithm. RANSAC provides a robust

event that has a larger range and smaller peak charge. The two right plots show a typical fusion event with a shorter range and
much larger energy loss at the position of the fusion event leading to higher peak charge.

way to ﬁt a line to the track positions where the algo-
rithm iteratively estimates the line’s parameters. At
each iteration, RANSAC estimates a model on a ran-
dom subset and checks whether the estimated model
is valid. It then classiﬁes all the data points as either
inliers or outliers by calculating their residuals using
the estimated model. All data points with residu-
als smaller than the predeﬁned residual-threshold are
considered inliers. Once the best-ﬁt line parameters
are determined, the direction and range of a track
can be deduced. Fig. 11(a) shows a sample event
where hierarchical-clustering identiﬁed three diﬀerent
tracks, i.e. the incoming beam track, the scattered
beam track and the scattered 4He track. Fig. 11(b)
shows the implementation of RANSAC for each of the
identiﬁed clusters. RANSAC ﬁt three diﬀerent lines,
one for each track and also rejected outlier points
which were initially identiﬁed as a part of a track
cluster. Data analysis codes using these algorithms
are currently under development and will provide a
robust way to track particles and identify reaction
channels in future experiments.

5. Current and Future Developments

The ND-Cube will serve as a development plat-
form for the use of novel gas mixtures, diﬀerent types
of MPGDs, the use of ancillary detectors, and anal-
ysis techniques. One of the important features of

event for the 7Li +α system. The beam path as well both
scattered particle tracks are visible.

active-target detectors has been the use of pure hy-
drogen, deuterium, and noble gases as a target and
tracking medium [28]. The use of pure gases, such
as hydrogen and helium, for scattering experiments
and noble gases, such as Ne and Ar, for fusion exper-
iments is advantageous as the data will be free from
any undesired background events originating from re-
actions on the nuclei of a quench gas. The feasibility
of using pure gases in active-target TPCs has been
demonstrated by the combined use of THGEM lay-
ers and a Micromegas [28]. The ND-Cube will be
used to investigate the use of these pure gases and
other potentially useful gas mixtures.

As a ﬁrst step in this direction, we provide the ﬁrst
gain measurements using a double-layer THGEM in
the ND-Cube using a Ne:H2 (95:5) gas mixture. Use
of Ne gas as a target for fusion reactions has been of
high interest for astrophysics [29]. In Ne:H2 mixtures,
the H2 acts as a quench and Penning gas [30] but has
very little impact on measurement of fusion reactions
using the technique described in Section 4.1. For the
gain measurements, we operated our THGEM in sym-
metric mode, i.e. the potential diﬀerence across the
THGEM’s two layers was kept same (∆V1=∆V2 in
Fig. 4). The gain curve for a 300-Torr Ne:H2(95:5)
gas mixture is shown in Fig. 12. In future studies, the
THGEM in combination with the Micromegas will be
used to perform reaction studies with pure gas targets
such as He and H2.

Other important future advancements will be de-

velopment and integration of ancillary detectors with
the ND-Cube. In many experimental scenarios, light
energetic particles will leave the active region of the
ND-Cube where particle identiﬁcation and/or the mea-
surement of total energy may be diﬃcult. The ad-
dition of ancillary detectors around the active region
can give information, such as total energy, on the par-
ticles leaving the active region of the detector. Such
ancillary detectors may include silicon detectors, scin-
tillator detectors, or gas detectors. Future develop-
ments will include testing designs and integration of
such ancillary detectors with the ND-Cube.

6. Summary and Outlook

We have developed a new active-target detector,
the ND-Cube, and have tested and commissioned the
detector for use in nuclear physics experiments at
the Nuclear Science Laboratory at the University of
Notre Dame. This included measurements with an
α source, an in-beam measurement with a 7Li beam,
and gas gain measurements with a double-layer THGEM.
The in-beam 7Li experiment was performed using two
diﬀerent target gases for two diﬀerent studies: a fu-
sion cross section measurement and the recording of
two-body α scattering. We measured the 7Li+40Ar
fusion cross section using P10 gas, and elastic scatter-
ing, 7Li(α, α)7Li, was observed using He:CO2 gas as a
target. The 7Li+40Ar fusion cross sections measured

Figure 12: (Color Online) Plot shows the gain curve in 300
torr of Ne:H2(95:5) gas mixture. THGEMs were operated in
the symmetric mode i.e. voltage diﬀerence across the two am-
pliﬁcation regions was was same (∆V=∆V1=∆V2).

in this work are in good agreement with optical model
calculations, which provides conﬁdence for the future
use of ND-Cube in the study of fusion reactions with
the radioactive isotope beams. For the α scattering
data, the initial performance of the tracking analy-
sis, currently under development, is shown. The ﬁrst
measurement of the gain of a double-layer THGEM

was made for a Ne:H2 mixture, the results of which
will be used for future fusion studies with Ne isotopes.
Future developments will include use of ancillary de-
tectors. The ND-Cube provides a promising platform
to perform nuclear reaction experiments with the ra-
dioactive beams from the TwinSol facility at Notre
Dame. Use of an active-target detector will enhance
the capabilities to perform direct reaction measure-
ments such as (p,α), (α,p), and (α,n) reactions, other
transfer reactions, and fusion studies.
