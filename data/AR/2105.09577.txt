Gaseous detectors are widely used in high energy physics, and are attractive choices in

tracking systems for cosmic muon imaging, also called muography. Such detectors offer

high resolution and high efﬁciency at reasonable cost for large sizes, however, one of the

drawbacks is that the gaseous detection medium must be prevented from contamination

by outside air or internal outgassing. Standard systems work with a constant gas ﬂow,

leading to regular maintenance in the form of gas cylinder changes, which can be an is-

sue for remote ﬁeld applications. In this paper we discuss the practical possibilities to

reduce gas consumption of an outdoor gaseous tracker, where particularly the gas density

change from daily temperature cycling limits the input ﬂow. Such "breathing" effect can

be circumvented by well designed buffer volume, which must prevent external air contam-

ination. A realistic MWPC tracking test system with 0.9 square meter area, total volume

of 160 l, has been operated for 36 days with a ﬂow of 3 l/day, conﬁrming that the buffer

volume, in this case a 50 m long and 10 l volume low diffusion tube, ensures sufﬁcient

gas quality. The key effects governing the gas ﬂow dynamics, including diffusion and gas

volume change, has been studied quantitatively, leading to practical design prescriptions.

INTRODUCTION

Imaging the internal structure of large size objects with cosmic particles, or muography in
short, is a non-invasive survey method, initiated in the 1960-ies, with pioneering work by Alvarez1

searching for hidden chambers in a pyramid, and later applied successfully on magma dynamics of
volcanoes by Tanaka2. It is used worldwide, including major volcanoes such as Etna3, Vesuvius4,5,
Stromboli6; La Soufrière volcano7–9; and Sakurajima10. Muography has developed so that the

imaging properties and possible methodologies are now well understood. A large number of
applications exist11,12 such as search for archaeological or natural underground structures13–17,
mining18, nuclear reactor imaging19 and renewed interest in the internal structure of large histori-
cal objects20.

Muography requires a tracking system for precision directional measurement of muons, for
which three basic technologies exist. Emulsions21,22 offer low maintenance and simple installa-

tion, at the cost of pre- and post-processing of the detection material, and lack the possibility of
real time imaging. Scintillators23,24 are probably the most popular systems being highly reliable

and needing low maintenance, however these may have high weight, and become expensive if high

angular resolution is required.

The third class of detector technologies apply gaseous detection medium. Such detectors offer
high efﬁciency, good position resolution, low weight, and are cost efﬁcient25. However, besides

their complexity, the usage of gas as detection medium presents a challenge. The outdoor applica-

tion in muography, requiring low maintenance, tolerance of environmental effects and robustness,

gave rise to recent developments in instrumentation which can reduce gas consumption and en-

sures safe and reliable operation.

The family of "gaseous tracking detectors" is very broad, including the classical Multi-Wire
Proportional Chambers (MWPCs)26 but also recent developments for improved position reso-
lution and rate capability, called the Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors27,28, and Resistive Plate

Chambers (RPC)29,30 particularly for improved time resolution. The technical challenges are also

very diverse, and there are design choices with corresponding pros and cons.

For any gaseous detector, sufﬁcient gas purity must be maintained, since the working gas can
be contaminated by air (oxygen) by either diffusion or outgassing from construction materials31

which reduces performance. For all discussions below, we deﬁne "outgassing" as gain reduction

relative to the pure gas (high ﬂow) case. Throughout the paper, the "gain" is deﬁned as the mean

2

of the signal amplitude for identiﬁed tracks. This is always expressed relative to a reference:

normalized either to the gain of other detectors, or the gain relative to a reference time period.

In fact, outgassing is a very broad and complicated term, which includes electronegative

molecules from construction materials, but also ambient oxygen from diffusion through detector
walls, or water which changes electron drift velocity. An inspiring study32 pinpointed speciﬁc

construction materials as source of water and oxygen contamination in muon detectors, and

demonstrated the effectiveness of a partially recycled, ﬁltered gas system. Contamination causes
various adverse effects such as ageing31, which are in our cases limited due to the low natural

radiation level.

The "outgassing", as here deﬁned, includes not only diffusion, but even tiny leaks if exist. The

contamination can be translated to effective air content, which would correspond to the same gain
reduction25. The outgassing rate can be quantiﬁed from the time derivative of the gain reduction,

assuming closed system with constant environmental conditions ("sealed mode").

Indeed it would be advantageous to make a gaseous detector fully sealed, and various studies

made progress in this direction. In fact it is possible to construct a large size cosmic detector using

sealed proportional counters33. A portable muon telescope was proposed using gas-tight RPC-s34,
whereas under laboratory conditions as much as half a year sealed operation was demonstrated35.

On the practical side, construction is easier and weight can be lower if some gas ﬂow is allowed

to purge contamination. This is so because daily pressure variation and volume variation can be

large, therefore the system is preferably open-ended to avoid mechanical stress on the containment

structure. Certainly the supply ﬂow should be as small as possible.

The key question which we address in this paper: how to achieve as low input ﬂow as possible

in a gaseous detector for a realistic, full size portable outdoor muography system?

Challenges related to a low-ﬂow system in outdoor conditions include the following:

• Intrinsic detector outgassing. The present paper is not dealing with the problem, however,

the detector should be as good as possible already in laboratory conditions. The test system

presented in this paper was checked for outgassing (gain drop in sealed mode), as discussed

below.

• Day/night temperature variation causes gas volume change, hence "breathing", which can

contaminate the gas line from the end (an effect which is much less relevant for underground

experiments).

3

• Ambient pressure change causes similar "breathing", which may be episodic such as during

a storm.

• Back-diffusion of ambient air from such an open end may cause contamination, therefore a

sufﬁciently long exhaust tube is needed. Placing a barrier such as a bubbler is not applicable,

since the "breathing" effect moves typically much larger volume than the supply from the

input.

The problems are most apparent for large gas volumes, which are again, difﬁcult to reduce with-

out performance loss (reducing volume at given area means reducing detector chamber thickness,
leading to construction issues31). As an example, at the Sakurajima Muography Observatory, one
single module36 has typically 100-160 l volume, and with a total daily input of 30-40 l, volume

change time constant is 3-5 days.

Adding a buffer volume, which has a sufﬁciently large volume, and at the same time long

enough to restrict diffusion, is a very practical solution. This possibility will be investigated

throughout this paper in details.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II is about chamber outgassings and tubing radial

diffusions. These are the limiting factors running at any gas ﬂow. Section III elaborates on the

diffusion along the buffer tube from the open end to quantify the required length that restrict this

effect. Section IV is quantiﬁcation of ﬂow rate caused by "breathing" from ambient temperature

cycling. Section V discusses the interplay of all these effects, based on a long term outdoor mea-

surement, and demonstrating low ﬂow operation. Section VI presents the practical implementation

at the Sakurajima Muography Observatory, and an example calculation of underground applica-

tion.

II. OUTGASSING AND RADIAL DIFFUSION

Gas contamination, including diffusion through chamber walls and gas release from internal

components, is a fundamental limiting factor for detector operation.

In our case, this will be

measured by the gain reduction according to the deﬁnition of the "outgassing" above, since due to

the short drift length it correlates well with the tracking performance.

The diffusion along a tube will be called "axial diffusion" (longitudinal diffusion), which ac-

tually transfers external air from open end, and can as well transfer contamination between inter-

connected detector chambers.

Low ﬂow operation requires a gas system with sufﬁcient quality, so that the input gas contami-

nation does not compromise performance. In our case, as it will be shown, this was an unexpect-

edly large, but acceptable effect due to a long connecting tube between gas source and the ﬁrst

detector chamber input.

A. Measurement of detector outgassing

The general measurement setup used throughout the paper is shown in Fig. 1, with horizontal
MWPCs25, and a single gas line in series, with input at the bottom layer, using the same readout

system as presented in Varga36.

The ﬁrst series of measurements were aimed at quantifying the outgassing of the chambers:

that is, the rate of gain reduction in sealed mode. For this, eight chambers with 120 cm

80 cm

×

size were installed under laboratory conditions. For sufﬁciently long time, constant gas ﬂow was

driven through all the chambers. After reaching stable gain, the gas line was rearranged so that

some of the detector chambers along the chain were isolated (input closed) whereas others still

received the constant ﬂow. This way, the latters could be used as references, relative to which the

gains of the plugged detector chambers were measured.

The result of the measurements is shown in Fig. 2. In the ﬁrst Run (left panel) the chambers

2, 3, and 5 were plugged and measured for outgassing with three reference chambers, and in

TABLE I. Gain reduction rate due to outgassing ( %/day) for all detector chambers.

The conclusion of the measurement is that the outgassing of these units under laboratory con-

ditions is surprisingly low, below 0.3% per day. Even 30% gain reduction causes no efﬁciency

loss which means that the full volume can be exchanged in 100 days if we assume linearity. In our

6

 
 
case (8 detector chambers with total volume of 160 l) this means a practical lower limit of ﬂow of

0.07 l/h, or 1 cc/min, or 1.6 l/day.

Motivated by this attractively low outgassing of the single chambers, the question we ask is

what needs to be done in order to approach this theoretical gas consumption in practical, ambient

outdoor conditions? As discussed in the Introduction, if we wish to use a buffer volume which

feeds gas back to the chamber system, candidates for such buffer tubing need to be characterized

for outgassing as well, which is discussed in the next section.

B. Tubing radial diffusion

Tubes in the gas system contribute to contamination because of the diffusion through their

walls, hence the name "radial". Potential practical choices need to be tested and selected for

acceptable outgassing. We have found that some samples of PVC tubes are strongly reducing

gain; however, PU (polyurethane), PA (polyamide), PE (polyethylene), copper, and stainless steel

perform well. In order to quantify "outgassing", the following measurements were performed.

Using the standard setup with a serial gas line running at constant ﬂow (with a same MWPC

detector type but smaller, 40 cm

×

40 cm size chambers), the tube section under study was con-

nected between two chambers. In this setting the chambers before the test tube act as references,

and the gain reduction can be measured using the detector chamber after the test tube. In order to

further reduce the systematic errors, after reaching the saturated constant gain, the test tube was

removed and the original (minimum length) gas connection was re-installed, resulting in a fast

return to the reference gain value. Examples are shown in Fig. 3, both for the stability of the

reference, as well as the level of gain drop after the test tubes. The lengths and the ﬂows were

chosen as they typically occurred during further measurements.

In conclusion, speciﬁc gas tube samples could be selected for sufﬁciently low outgassing, in-

cluding a small (4 mm inner, 6 mm outer diameter) PA, and a large (16 mm inner, 21 mm outer

diameter) PE-RT tube, thus ensuring that gas contamination is low even if the gas dwells for a long

time in these tubes.

One of the reference chambers is indicated in purple. After 40 and 50 hours respectively, the test tubes were

removed and the gains clearly returned to the reference.

III. AXIAL DIFFUSION

The process of air diffusion in one dimension along tubing, most relevantly from the open end,

is referred to below as axial diffusion. The process is well understood theoretically, therefore

there are very clear predictions about what to expect. A set of measurements were designed in

order to test if the system quantitatively follows these predictions, to ensure that in a complicated

ambient condition one clearly understands the governing effects and to demonstrate that there are

no additional effects beyond the pure diffusion.

The measurement setup consisted of six detector chambers of the same type as in the previous

section, note again, with 40 cm size to reduce measurement time and effects related to volume

change. The principle is the following: a test tube of variable length was attached to the exhaust

of the last chamber in the gas chain, and at t = 0 the gas input of this single chamber was closed.

Due to diffusion, the gas in the exhaust tube starts to be contaminated with air, which at some

point reaches the detector. Then air diffuses into the sensitive volume, leading to decrease in the

gain. The variable length test tube was rather thick (16 mm inner diameter), and it was attached to

a short exhaust tube of ﬁxed 14 cm length and 4 mm inner diameter.

In the case where the test tube length is practically zero, there is a constant diffusion from

the outside ambient air through the short exhaust tube, and therefore one expects a constant gain

8

 
change (constant time derivative of the gain). This constant corresponds to the "pure air" concen-

tration. The measurement, shown in Fig. 4, conﬁrms this expectation: gain change rate at the "0

m" test tube length is indeed constant (normalized to 1 on the ﬁgure). If one varies the tube length,

then the gain change (using the same normalization) effectively measures the air concentration

at the end of the tube. Indeed, Fig. 4 shows that 1 m, 2 m, and 4 m test tube lengths feature a

considerably slower gain change. The rate of change approaches the ambient concentration after

a long time.

The laws of diffusion (Fick’s laws) give a very clear analytic prediction for this measurement

conﬁguration. In the general case air concentration (c) along the tube is governed by the drift-

diffusion equation

fusion. The radial diffusion has been discussed in the previous section, and found to be negligible

for this measurement. The gas movement along the tube will be the subject of the next section,

however for this measurement setup one can assume v = 0 now. After these considerations, the

solution of the pure diffusion equation for air concentration (c) in an inﬁnitely long tube is

where Ldiff is the length from the open end. For our measurement, the boundary condition

at the detector end (opposite to the open end) of the test tube is such that the ﬂux is nearly zero

(the short exhaust tube is much thinner than the test tube). Using the relevant solution, shown

with continuous lines in Fig. 4, one gets a nice agreement with the measurement at the diffusion
0.7 mm2/s (error is statistical only, whereas systematic errors up to 30%

constant value D = 20.1

could not be ruled out). It is remarkable to observe the scaling behaviour: a 4 m long tube takes 16

times longer time to reach the same concentration by diffusion. There is no indication of deviation

from the "diffusion-only" behaviour after 30 hours, due to outgassing, radial diffusion, or leaks. In

practice, due to diffusion only, after 24 (6) hours the air contamination in a tube, originally ﬁlled

with pure gas, is around 1250 ppm at a distance of 6 (3) m from the open end, calculated from Eq.

were connected to the same setup, and the gas supply was closed at t = 0. Continuous lines show prediction

IV. "BREATHING" EFFECT FROM TEMPERATURE CYCLING

Assuming that the pressure and temperature inside the chambers follow the external conditions,

the total mass of working gas stored varies strongly, due to both temperature changes and external

pressure changes. In ﬁeld applications the daily temperature cycles are a major issue at low input

ﬂow: if the input does not feed sufﬁcient working gas, external air may be drawn in through the

exhaust. In this section, we present the quantiﬁcation and conﬁrmation of the appearance of this

effect.

The image of the measurement setup, following the structure according to Fig. 1, is shown in

Fig. 5 installed on the ﬂat rooftop of the laboratory building. A light box, as well as reﬂective

coverage, was used to protect from rain and direct sunlight. The eight detector chambers of 80 cm

x 120 cm size, each with 20 liter volume, were operated from a variable ﬂow gas source, fed from

the inside of the building. As presented in Section II A, the ordering of the chambers in the serial

gas line was such that the gas entered at the bottom, then fed the top chambers, with the middle

chambers at the end of the chain (exhaust after Chamber 3), this way compensating for possible

temperature gradient effects inside the box.

When the temperature drops, basic thermodynamics laws predict at which point the exhaust

values (assuming that the relative pressure change is small), against ﬁxed T0 and P0 references,

and V0 is the total gas volume in the detector at reference state. Thus the equation means that the

exhaust ﬂow turns negative if the volume change - due to relative temperature or pressure change

over time - is greater than the input ﬂow. In order to test this prediction, we have measured the

gain of the last chamber in the chain with a short, negligible volume buffer tube attached to it. We

expect a sharp gain reduction when the Iout turns negative, and thus air rapidly enters into the last

chamber. The measurement is shown in Fig. 6, conﬁrming a fast gain change at a speciﬁc value

of the time derivative of the temperature. For clarity, the top panel shows the raw measurement

(gain and temperature), whereas the lower panel is the numerical time derivative, which carries the

quantitative information (according to Equation 3).

The measurement was repeated for multiple days, attempting to observe the gain drop, and

determine the corresponding critical temperature drop rate for various ﬂow values. Fig. 7 shows

follow the direct prediction, and more importantly, conﬁrm the quantitative parameters of our

system.

One can conclude that temperature cycling (speciﬁcally, temperature reduction) can cause air

contamination from the exhaust side which can and must be mitigated by sufﬁcient buffer vol-

ume. Combined with the results of the previous section, the buffer tube must be extended with an

additional length to compensate for axial diffusion.

V. LOW-FLOW OUTDOOR OPERATION

The test system was the same as the one described in the previous section, and a sufﬁciently

long buffer tube has been attached after the last chamber in the gas line. The required buffer

volume can be derived from Eq. (3) if we take an upper estimation with zero input ﬂow:

A 50 m long PE-RT tube with 16 mm inner diameter has been chosen, that is, nearly 10 liters

total volume. A 15 °C temperature drop would correspond to a 8 l volume to be supplied from the

buffer tube (40 m) at very low input ﬂow, with sufﬁcient remaining length (10 m) to compensate

for daily axial diffusion. The purpose of the test was to demonstrate the practical applicability of

the previous considerations.

The measurement took about 50 days, during which the system was running continuously. The

working gas was supplied from the inside of the building for simpler and better controlled gas

input. The overview of the measurement results and conditions is shown in Fig. 8. The gain is

deﬁned as the mean of the signal amplitude for identiﬁed tracks, and the "normalized gain" is the

gain relative to the mean of the ﬁrst 3 days. The ﬁgure shows the environmental conditions on

the middle panel, with considerable daily temperature swings, as well as rainy periods with high

humidity.

The ﬂow was 2 l/h during the ﬁrst 3 days, which was constant for a sufﬁcient time before the

beginning of the measurements. Then, for 4 days, the ﬂow was set to 0.32 l/h. As the gain did not

show signs of deterioration, the ﬂow was optimistically reduced as low as 0.12 l/h. For 36 days,

the system was running at this input ﬂow, when it was raised back to 2 l/h in order to conﬁrm

return to the original gain value.

The daily gain variation due to the correlation with pressure and temperature is evident from

the raw data (as the uncorrected gain data shows in Fig. 8, purple line), caused by gas density
change26,31. In order to correct for this, the correction factors have been determined, as shown in

Fig. 9. On the left panel, the normalized measured gain change depends linearly on the the relative

pressure change, where P′ = (P

−

966)/966 (here P is measured in mbar). The middle panel

shows the correlation with the relative temperature change, where T ′ = (T

293)/293 (here T is

−

measured in Kelvin). We have identiﬁed an additional variable which affects the measured gain:

this is the current (I) drawn on the high voltage (anode) as it decreases the operating voltage due to

the high output resistance of the used HV unit. This dark current is originated from temperature-

dependent resistance of the construction materials of these chambers, and is signiﬁcant above 35

°C (though not leading to efﬁciency loss). The gain correlates linearly with current, as shown on

the right panel of Fig. 9, which matches with the output impedance with the high voltage unit.

Since all these correlations (T, P, I) could be quantiﬁed, the measured gain has been corrected for,

as shown on the top panel of Fig. 8.

During the 40 days measurement at reduced ﬂow, the gain was gradually decreasing and satu-

rated at around 87% of the original gain, which is a minor reduction leading to no visible tracking

or trigger efﬁciency loss (as concluded in Section II A). It is also worth mentioning that the last

chamber in the gas line, which received gas from the buffer every day due to breathing, was not

contaminated signiﬁcantly compared to the other chambers (Fig. 8 top, blue data).

The evolution of the corrected normalized gain chamber-by-chamber (Fig. 10) corresponds to

the expectation from the lab measurements, with a gradual decreasing trend due to outgassing.

At this ﬂow value, the equilibration time is long: only 3 liters of gas are supplied each day, or in

other words, it takes 1 week for the full gas exchange of a single chamber. Fig. 8 top panel shows

the mean of all detector chambers; if however one looks at the individual chambers in Fig. 10,

it is apparent that all chamber gains move together. This rules out a uniform outgassing pattern

(chambers later in the chain should have lower gains), an effect which we identiﬁed (after the

measurements) to be due to the outgassing of the long input supply line. The gas line integrity is

demonstrated by the sequential cleaning of the chamber after switching to the standard 2 l/h ﬂow

on 29th Aug.

The measurements indicate that this detector system can be operated safely and without per-

formance loss at a ﬂow of 0.12 l/h (3 l/day) in ambient ﬁeld conditions with the described gas

buffering scheme.

IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES

A practical implementation of the proposed structure is relevant at the Sakurajima Muography

Observatory (SMO)10,36. Currently there are 11 MWPC-based Muography Observation System

(MMOS) modules, each containing 7 or 8 layers of 80 cm x 80 cm or 120 cm x 80 cm size
chambers with a total sensitive area of 8.7 m2. The maximum gas volume of an MMOS module is

160 l. The gas ﬂow for one MMOS was 2 l/h until March 2020, after conﬁrming safe operation the

ﬂow was reduced to 1 l/h per MMOS thus doubling the time between two gas cylinder replacement.

Fig. 11 shows the highest daily negative temperature time derivatives at the SMO during a full year

period. The drop rate reaches only -1.6 °C/h, that is, the systems will not ingest from the buffer

volume even at 1 l/h, based on the measurement from Fig. 7. However, for safety, buffer tubes

were attached already to the end of every MMOS. The gain stability has been checked before and

after March, as shown in Fig. 12.

It is important to note that at low ﬂow, the detector outgassing is highly relevant, and each

MMOS has to be properly checked for leaks or outgassing (see Section II A), a time consuming

activity which could not be performed in 2020.

In case of underground applications, the daily temperature variations are usually much smaller

than on the surface, therefore the necessary buffer volume is smaller as well. In this case, the

pressure change may need to be considered also. The axial diffusion can still be compensated with

10 m extra constant diameter buffer assuming non-zero input ﬂow, and Eq. (4) can be used to

For example, the case of 20 mbar pressure rise in less than 24 hours (e.g., typical central

European strong cold front) means a 2% relative pressure change and thus around 3 liters of

required buffer for a 160 l volume detector with very low ﬂow.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The present paper discusses one of the most relevant challenges of gaseous tracking detectors

for muography: reducing gas consumption. In a practical implementation, the daily temperature

variation causes a "breathing" effect, which is difﬁcult to mitigate, and none of the trivial possi-

bilities are attractive to designers (such as reduction of the detector volume, or highly effective

heat insulation, or allowing considerable pressure change inside the detector chambers). We have

investigated the application of a sufﬁciently long buffer tube, which is a simple and robust solution

provided that some design speciﬁcations (length, volume, outgassing) discussed in the paper are

followed. The concept was demonstrated during a long term (ﬁve weeks) outdoor measurement

at low (3 l/day) ﬂow with the same type of detectors as installed at the Sakurajima Muography

Observatory.
