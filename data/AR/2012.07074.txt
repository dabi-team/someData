ABSTRACT

Context. Kink oscillations in coronal loops are ubiquitous, and the observed parameters of oscillations are applied to estimate the
magnetic ﬁeld strength of the loops.
Aims. In this work, we report our multiwavelength observations of the transverse oscillation of a large-scale coronal loop with a
350 Mm. The oscillation was induced by a blowout coronal jet, which was related to a C4.2 circular-ribbon ﬂare (CRF)
length of
≥
in AR 12434 on 2015 October 16. We aim to determine the physical parameters in the coronal loop, including the Alfvén speed and
magnetic ﬁeld strength.
Methods. The jet-induced kink oscillation was observed in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths by the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Line of sight magnetograms were observed by the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board SDO. We took several slices along the loop to assemble time-distance diagrams, and used
an exponentially decaying sine function to ﬁt the decaying oscillation. The initial amplitude, period, and damping time of kink
oscillation were obtained. Coronal seismology of the kink mode was applied to estimate the Alfvén speed and magnetic ﬁeld strength
in the oscillating loop. In addition, we measured the magnetic ﬁeld of the loop through non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) modeling
using the ﬂux rope insertion method.
Results. The oscillation is most pronounced in AIA 171 and 131 Å. The oscillation is almost in phase along the loop with a peak
initial amplitude of
3.5
cycles with an average period of
2.5. Based on

1. Introduction

Waves and oscillations are prevalent in the fully ionized so-
lar corona with temperatures of several million Kelvin (MK)
(see Nakariakov & Verwichte 2005, and refererence therein).
The periodic transverse displacements of coronal loops are
usually considered as kink oscillations detected in the ex-
treme ultraviolet
(EUV) wavelengths (Andries et al. 2009;
Ruderman & Erdélyi 2009). Standing fast kink-mode oscil-
lations were initially discovered by the Transition Region
and Coronal Explorer (TRACE; Handy et al. 1999) mission
in 171 Å (Aschwanden et al. 1999; Nakariakov et al. 1999;
Schrijver et al. 2002). Since the launch of the Solar Dynam-
ics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012), kink oscillations
of coronal loops observed by the Atmospheric Imaging As-
sembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board SDO have been
extensively investigated (e.g., Aschwanden & Schrijver 2011;
White & Verwichte 2012; Verwichte et al. 2013a,b; Pascoe et al.

2016; Nisticò et al. 2017; Duckenﬁeld et al. 2018, 2019;
Nechaeva et al. 2019).

The commencement of the loop oscillation usually coincides
with a nearby eruption (ﬂare, jet, or ﬁlament eruption) in the
lower corona, which is considered as the predominant mech-
anism for exciting kink oscillations (Zimovets & Nakariakov
2015). After the excitation, kink oscillations experience atten-
uation and last for several cycles in most cases (Goddard et al.
2016; Goddard & Nakariakov 2016). Resonant absorption, as
a result of resonance within a ﬁnite thin layer, is believed to
play a key role in the rapid damping of fast-mode kink os-
cillations (Goossens et al. 2002; Ruderman & Roberts 2002).
Phase mixing with anomalously high viscosity is also im-
in the dissipation of energy during loop oscilla-
portant
tions (Ofman & Aschwanden 2002). Small-amplitude,
trans-
verse oscillations of coronal loops without signiﬁcant damp-
ing have been noticed (Anﬁnogentov et al. 2013; Nisticò et al.
2013; Li et al. 2018a; Zhang 2020). The observed loop os-
cillations in combination with magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)

wave theory provide an eﬀective tool to determine the local
physical parameters, such as the magnetic ﬁeld and Alfvén
speed of the oscillating loops, which are diﬃcult to measure
directly (Edwin & Roberts 1983; Nakariakov & Ofman 2001;
Aschwanden et al. 2002; Verwichte et al. 2006; Arregui et al.
2007; Goossens et al. 2008; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2008;
Antolin & Verwichte 2011; Yuan & Van Doorsselaere 2016;
Li et al. 2017).

Circular-ribbon ﬂares (CRFs) are a special type of ﬂares,
whose short, inner ribbons are surrounded by circular or ellip-
tical ribbons (Masson et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2019; Zhang et al.
2016b, 2019; Lee et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020). Transverse loop
oscillations excited by CRFs with periods of <
4 min have been
∼
observed by AIA (Zhang et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018b). Recently,
Zhang et al. (2020) investigated the transverse oscillations of an
EUV loop excited by two successive CRFs on 2014 March 5.
The oscillations are divided into two stages in their development:
the ﬁrst-stage oscillation triggered by the C2.8 ﬂare is decayless
with lower amplitudes, and the second-stage oscillation triggered
by the M1.0 ﬂare is decaying with larger amplitudes. The authors
also estimated the magnetic ﬁeld and thickness of the inhomo-

In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of
the transverse oscillation of a large-scale coronal loop excited by
a blowout jet associated with the C4.2 CRF in active region (AR)
12434 on 2015 October 16. Zhang et al. (2016c) studied the ex-
plosive chromospheric evaporation at the inner and outer ﬂare
ribbons using spectroscopic observations. This work is building
on the work of Zhang et al. (2016c) (hereafter Paper I), and the
main purpose is to estimate the magnetic ﬁeld of the oscillating
loop using two independent approaches, coronal seismology and
magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation. This paper is organized as follows.
Observations and data analysis are presented in Sect. 2. The re-
sults are presented in Sect. 3. A brief summary and discussion
are presented in Sect. 4.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

2.1. Instruments

The transverse oscillation of the coronal loop was observed by
SDO/AIA, which has a spatial resolution of 1′′. 2 and time ca-
dence of 12 s in EUV wavelengths. The photospheric line-of-
sight (LOS) magnetograms were observed by the Helioseis-
mic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou et al. 2012) on board
SDO with a spatial resolution of 1′′. 2 and time cadence of 45 s.
The level_1 data from AIA and HMI were calibrated using the
standard Solar SoftWare (SSW) programs aia_prep.pro and
hmi_prep.pro, respectively. Soft X-ray (SXR) light curves of
the ﬂare were recorded by the GOES spacecraft with a cadence
of

2.05 s.

2.2. DEM analysis

The diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) analysis
is a
useful tool to perform temperature diagnostics. Several algo-
rithms have been proposed and validated (e.g. Weber et al.
2004; Hannah & Kontar
2013;
Plowman et al. 2013; Cheung et al. 2015; Su et al. 2018b;
Morgan & Pickering 2019). The observed ﬂux Fi of each
optically thin passband i is determined by:

2012; Aschwanden et al.

T2

Fi =

Ri(T)DEM(T)dT ,

T1

Z

Article number, page 2 of 7

(1)

where Ri(T ) is the temperature response function of passband i,
and DEM(T) represents the DEM of multithermal plasma as a
function of temperature. log T1 = 5.5 and log T2 = 7.5 stand
for the lower and upper limits for the integral. To carry out
the inversion of DEM proﬁle, we use the standard SSW pro-
gram xrt_dem_iterative2.pro and six EUV passbands (94,
131, 171, 193, 211, and 335 Å). The method has been strictly
justiﬁed and successfully applied to the temperature estimation
of EUV hot channel as well as coronal jets (Cheng et al. 2012;
Zhang & Ji 2014; Zhang et al. 2016a). Note that the background
emissions should be removed before inversion.

The DEM-weighted average temperature ¯T is deﬁned as

2.3. Flux rope insertion method

(3)

We use the ﬂux rope insertion method developed by
van Ballegooijen (2004) to reconstruct the non-linear force-free
ﬁeld (NLFFF) of AR 12434. The advantage of this method is
that it can be applied to many diﬀerent situations including both
ARs (Su et al. 2009, 2011, 2018a) and quiet Sun (Su et al. 2015)
since no vector ﬁeld observations are required and the magnetic
ﬁeld lines of the best-ﬁt model match well the observed coronal
non-potential structures. Su (2019) gives a detailed review on the
application of the method. Reconstructing the coronal magnetic
ﬁelds in the target AR requires four steps:

1. Extrapolating the potential ﬁeld based on the corresponding

photospheric LOS magnetogram.

2. According to observations, creating a cavity in the potential
ﬁeld model, and then inserting a magnetic ﬂux rope along
the selected paths.

3. Creating a grid of models by adjusting axial ﬂux and poloidal

ﬂux of the inserted magnetic ﬂux rope.

4. Starting magneto-frictional relaxation (Yang et al. 1986) to
drive the magnetic ﬁeld towards a force free state, and then
comparing with observations to ﬁnd the best-ﬁt model.

also Fig. 5 in Paper I). The time of loop oscillation during
13:39
14:05 UT is labeled with yellow area. It is found that
the start time of transverse loop oscillation coincides with the
fast ejection of jet (see also Fig. 4 in Paper I), and the oscil-
lation covers part of the impulsive and whole decay phase of
the ﬂare, lasting for
26 min. The excitation of loop oscilla-
tion in our study can be interpreted by the schematic cartoon
(Zimovets & Nakariakov 2015, see their Fig. 2).

∼

To investigate the transverse loop oscillation, we choose
three points along the loop: the ﬁrst one is near the loop top,
the third one is close to the southwest footpoint, and the second
one in between. We place three artiﬁcial slices (S1, S2, and S3)
across the points and just perpendicular to the loop, which are
drawn with white solid lines in Fig. 1. The corresponding time-
distance diagrams in 171 Å are plotted in the top three panels of
Fig. 3. It is seen that excited by the jet, the loop deviated from
the equilibrium state and began to move southward at
13:39
UT coherently. Then the loop moved backward and oscillated
with decaying amplitude for more than three cycles. The almost
identical phases of the transverse loop oscillation at diﬀerent po-

true geometry of the loop could not be inferred by stereoscopy.

3.3. Magneticﬁeld determined by NLFFF modeling

To validate the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the oscillating loop
inferred from coronal seismology, we carry out NLFFF model-
ing to construct magnetic ﬁeld models by using the ﬂux rope
insertion method (van Ballegooijen 2004). We have brieﬂy in-
troduced the method in Sect. 2.3, and more details can be found
in Bobra et al. (2008) and Su et al. (2009, 2011).

The boundary condition for the high-resolution region is de-

2015 October 16. The longitude-latitude map of the radial com-

In Fig. 8(d), the observed loop is traced manually and marked
with the red line. In order to ﬁnd the ﬁeld line that best ﬁt the
observed loop, we ﬁrst measure the distance between a point on
the observed loop and the closest point on the projected ﬁeld line
in the image plane. These distances for various points along the
observed loop are then averaged, which is deﬁned as the “aver-
age deviation" (Su et al. 2009). The manually selected 3D ﬁeld
line that can minimize the deviation is considered as the line that
best ﬁts the observed loop (pink line), which is overlaid on the
AIA 171 Å image. The length of the pink line (

4. Summary and Discussion

In this work, we report our multiwavelength observations of the
transverse oscillation of a large-scale coronal loop induced by a
blowout jet related to a C4.2 CRF in AR 12434 on 2015 October
16. The oscillation is most pronounced in AIA 171 and 131 Å.
The oscillation is almost in phase along the loop with a peak ini-
13.6 Mm, meaning that the oscillation belong

As mentioned in Sect. 1, transverse loop oscillations trig-
gered by CRFs have been observed. Zhang et al. (2015) analyzed
an M6.7 ﬂare as a result of partial ﬁlament eruption on 2011
September 8. Kink oscillation was induced in an adjacent coro-
nal loop within the same AR (see their Fig. 7). The oscillation

compared with this study in Table 2. It is found that the values
of Ck and CA are close to each other for the two events. Both
the loop length and period in this study are
2 times larger than
those for the event in 2011. However, the density and magnetic
ﬁeld of the loop in 2011 are much larger than those in our study.
Zhang et al. (2020) investigated the decayless and decaying kink
oscillations of an EUV loop on 2014 March 5. For comparison,
the parameters, including the shortest loop length and period
among the three events, are also listed in the last row of Table 2.

Aschwanden & Schrijver (2011) compared the magnetic
ﬁeld of an oscillating loop determined by coronal seismology
with the result of magnetic extrapolation based on the poten-
tial ﬁeld source surface (PFSS) modeling using the photospheric
magnetogram. It is found that the average extrapolated magnetic
ﬁeld strength exceeded the seismologically determined value
4 G) by a factor of two. After improving the method of esti-
(
∼
mation of physical parameters by taking the eﬀect of density and
magnetic stratiﬁcation into account, the extrapolated magnetic
ﬁeld are optimized (Verwichte et al. 2013a). Guo et al. (2015)
reported the kink oscillation of a coronal loop with a total length
204 Mm, which was excited by the global fast magneto-
of
acoustic wave as a result of ﬂux rope eruption and the associ-
ated eruptive ﬂare on 2013 April 11. Based on coronal seismol-
ogy, they derived the spatial distribution of magnetic ﬁeld (
8 G)
along the loop, which matches with that derived by a potential
ﬁeld model. Long et al. (2017) estimated the magnetic ﬁeld of a
trans-equatorial loop system using two independent techniques.
It is found that the magnetic ﬁeld strength (
5.5 G) estimated by
two approaches are roughly equal.
