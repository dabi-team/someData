Abstract

ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5 has been suggested to be a white dwarf pulsar by Kato (2021, arXiv:2108.09060).

We obtained time-resolved photometry and identiﬁed the orbital and spin periods to be 0.523490(1) d and
0.00678591(1) d = 9.77 min, respectively. These values strengthen the similarity of this object with AR Sco.
We estimated that the strength of the spin pulse is 3.6 times smaller than in AR Sco.

1 Introduction

ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5 is a variable object detected by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae
(ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014, Kochanek et al. 2017). This object was also independently listed as a candidate
RR Lyr star by Sesar et al. (2017) using the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-
STARRS1, Chambers et al. 2016). It was also independently listed as a variable star ATO J313.9329+24.0092 by
Heinze et al. (2018) using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS, Tonry et al. 2018) data.
In Kato (2021), one of the authors (TK) reported superimposed long and short periods and suggested that this
object could be a white dwarf pulsar similar to AR Sco (Marsh et al. 2016; Stiller et al. 2018).

2 Observation and true orbital period

Following this suggestion, FJH reported time-resolved photometry on seven consecutive night between 2021
August 24 and 30 using a 50-cm telescope located in San Pedro de Atacama (Chile). The total number of
observations was 979 and the time resolution was 96 s. EP and AS also supplied a light curve using the 2.6-meter
reﬂector (Shajn Telescope, ZTSh) in Crimea. EP suggested that the orbital period would be longer than the
0.2 d one suggested by TK in vsnet-alert 26186.1

We reanalyzed the data from Public Data Release 6 of the Zwicky Transient Facility (Masci et al., 2019)
observations2 and found that the true orbital period is 0.523490(1) d (ﬁrst announced in vsnet-alert 262063),
not 10.803(2) d as reported in Kato (2021). The period and error were determined by the Phase Dispersion
Minimization (PDM; Stellingwerf 1978) method and the methods in Fernie (1989) and Kato et al. (2010). Figure
1 shows the phase-folded light curve using the true orbital period. The light curve is almost perfectly sinusoidal
and is interpreted as the reﬂection-type variation caused by strong irradiation from the white dwarf. This period
is conﬁrmed to express all the observations by FJH (ﬁgure 2). The initially obtained period of 10.803 d was an
alias of the 0.523490 d period resulting from the intervals of the nightly ZTF observations.

3 Spin period

ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5 showed short-period coherent variation in two ZTF time-resolved runs (Kato,
2021). The periods on the two nights were 0.00675(3) d and 0.00682(2) d. The pulse proﬁle using FJH data is
shown in ﬁgure 3. Almost sinusoidal 0.06-mag variations were clearly detected. The best period using this data
set is 0.0067882(7) d, although there remains a possibility of aliases (such as 0.006742 d). Using this value, we
have been able to identify the spin period using the ZTF data (ﬁgure 4). The resultant period is 0.00678591(1) d
= 9.77 min.

4 Comparison with AR Sco

With the newly determined orbital and spin periods, the similarity between ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5
has become more evident (table 1, the periods for AR Sco were taken from Stiller et al. 2018). As seen from the
almost zero color index in ﬁgure 1, ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5 is not very signiﬁcantly reddened. The Gaia
color GBP − GRP is +0.38 (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2021). Considering that the white dwarf and illuminated
hemisphere of the secondary are the dominant source of light, we consider the unreddened color to be around
0. On the other hand, AR Sco is more strongly reddened. The Gaia color GBP − GRP is +1.38. Assuming
that the unreddened colors of these two object are around 0, we can estimate extinctions by using the formula
A(G) = 1.89E(GBP − GRP) (Wang and Chen, 2019). We adopted A(G) values for 0.72 and 2.61 for ASASSN-V
J205543.90+240033.5 and AR Sco, respectively. Using Gaia parallaxes (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2021), the
unreddened absolute magnitudes (MG) of these two objects are +5.4 and +7.0, respectively. This indicates that
ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5 is intrinsically 4.4 times more luminous than AR Sco, which appears to reﬂect
the diﬀerence in the orbital period. The mean pulse amplitude is 0.7 mag (90%) in AR Sco (ﬁgure 10 in Stiller
et al. 2018). Considering that the system is 4.4 times more luminous in ASASSN-V J205543.90+240033.5, the
pulse amplitudes (0.06 mag) in the latter corresponds to 25% pulse in AR Sco, which means that the strength of
the spin pulse is 3.6 times smaller than in AR Sco. Whether this diﬀerence reﬂects the diﬀerence in the emission
mechanism needs to be studied by further multiwavelength observations.
