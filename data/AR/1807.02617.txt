ABSTRACT
Infants with a variety of complications at or before birth are classi-
fied as being at risk for developmental delays (AR). As they grow
older, they are followed by healthcare providers in an effort to
discern whether they are on a typical or impaired developmental
trajectory. Often, it is difficult to make an accurate determination
early in infancy as infants with typical development (TD) display
high variability in their developmental trajectories both in content
and timing. Studies have shown that spontaneous movements have
the potential to differentiate typical and atypical trajectories early
in life using sensors and kinematic analysis systems. In this study,
machine learning classification algorithms are used to take inertial
movement from wearable sensors placed on an infant for a day and
predict if the infant is AR or TD, thus further establishing the con-
nection between early spontaneous movement and developmental
trajectory.

1 INTRODUCTION
An increasing number of infants with neuromuscular impairments
survive past birth due to improvements in obstetric and neonatal
medicine [1]. These infants with complications at birth are classified
as being at risk for developmental delay (AR), and some are later
diagnosed with cognitive and/or physical developmental delays [8].
Early motor delays are often the initial signs of later developmental

impairments [8]. A current challenge in the field of physical therapy
is identifying neuromotor impairment accurately and early enough
so that interventions can take place before the developmental de-
lay is pronounced. One approach is tracking early spontaneous
movements which have been shown to be correlated to future mo-
tor control [17]. Specifically, researchers propose that neurological
deficits could be identified by collecting high quality spontaneous
movement patterns from wearable sensors and kinematic analysis
systems [9, 10, 19].

Using sensors and kinematic analysis systems across short ses-
sions (5-10 minutes), studies have demonstrated that kinematic vari-
ables, such as kicking frequency, spatiotemporal organization, and
interjoint and interlimb coordination are different between infants
with typical development (TD) and infants at risk (AR) including
infants with intellectual disability [13], myelomeningocele [21, 23],
Down syndrome [15], as well as infants born preterm [7].

The goal of our work is to use day-long kinematic data collected
from wearable inertial sensors to predict the infant’s developmental
classification as TD or AR. A prediction algorithm that is able to
classify between TD and AR would further establish and expand
on the initial results of demonstrated differences in spontaneous
movements of infants with TD and AR, supporting the potential
of full-day wearable sensor data in future research and prediction
algorithms.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
discusses the methodology adopted, data preprocessing, and clas-
sification. Section 3 provides the results of various methods and
compares them to more interpretable methods. Section 4 discusses
the future steps of this project.

2 METHODOLOGY
2.1 Data
The dataset was provided by the Infant Neuromotor Control Lab-
oratory in the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy
at the University of Southern California. It contains day-long in-
ertial movement data from Opal sensors affixed on each infant
ankle using leg warmers with pockets. Past work has validated that
these sensors can accurately record quantity of infant limb move-
ments and do not impede or promote infant movement [11, 24]. The
dataset contains 19 movement features that summarize the general
movement characteristics of each infant across the time the infant
was awake during that day. The dataset consists of data from 12
TD infants and 24 AR infants. Each infant was tested 3 times from

1 to 16 months (with the exception of 1 AR infant with only two
sessions) at various developmental stages.

principle. The reason for ensembling is to level individual algorithm
bias and to reduce overfitting by smoothing the results [25].

2.2 Data Preprocessing
The sensors collected raw movement data from an accelerome-
ter, gyroscope, and magnetometer. In post-analysis, we used an
established algorithm that detects each leg movement from the raw
sensor data [24, 26]. Next, the movement’s duration, average acceler-
ation, peak acceleration, and type (unilateral, bilateral synchronous,
or bilateral asynchronous) were determined by the algorithm.

The dataset contains 19 movement features which can be broken
down into 4 categories: movement count, duration, average accel-
eration, and peak acceleration. Specifically, the dataset includes the
overall movement count and type of each movement for both the
right and left legs. Movement count is presented as movements per
hour of awake time and type is presented as a percentage of each
type of movement made out of the total number of movements
made. The dataset also includes the average and standard deviation
of movement duration, average acceleration, and peak acceleration
over all the infant’s movements across the full day. Additionally,
the movement features, age, developmental scale score (specifically
the Alberta Infant Motor Scale [18]), and the AR/TD label were
also included. Due to our small sample size (12 TDs and 24 ARs),
we treated each new visit as a unique data record allowing for 107
samples of day-long leg movement, with 37 TDs and 100 ARs.

First, we normalized the data to correctly reflect the infants’
movements due to each sensor being active for a different amount
of time during the data collection. We then split the dataset into
two groups, 0 to 6 months and 6 to 12 months, because there are
noticeable changes in the movement features after 6 months and
important developmental milestones emerge after this time for
infants [6]. Also, the few samples over 12 months were each from
an AR infant, so we removed these samples to reduce overfitting
around age. Thus, we had 16 TD and 15 AR samples for 0 to 6
months and 23 TD and 38 AR samples for 6 to 12 months. The class
weights for TD and AR were balanced for each algorithm used.

2.3 Feature Extraction
We extracted the relevant features out of the 22 to avoid unneces-
sary and intercorrelated inputs. We applied three feature extraction
methods (univariate feature selection [22], recursive feature elimi-
nation (RFE) [14], and stepwise feature selection [16]) separately
on the 0-6 month and 6-12 month dataset. For each feature subset
selected by the algorithms, we removed highly correlated features
to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set.

2.4 Classification
We used a binary classification approach for our models. To classify
infants as TD or AR, various classification algorithms were spot
checked using their default parameters including Random Forest [3],
Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM) [2], K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN) [12], Decision Trees [20], and AdaBoost [5].

We improved the performance by using grid search for tuning
hyper parameters for each method, and the three top performing al-
gorithms were put into a voting ensemble with a majority vote wins

3 RESULTS
3.1 Evaluation
We used a leave-one-out cross validation for model selection, a
common approach for small datasets [4]. Standard metrics such
as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate
the classification algorithms. We focused on choosing algorithms
with higher true positives (TP) and false negatives (FN) because pre-
dicting AR infants correctly is more important for initial diagnosis
purposes.

3.2 Experiments and Outcomes

3.2.1

0 to 6 Month Prediction Algorithms. Based on the feature
extraction methods described above, we used eight movement fea-
tures: mean acceleration, peak acceleration, unilateral movements,
and total movements for the right and left leg. The results from
the tuned algorithms varied from 90% average accuracy for SVM to
67.7% for AdaBoost. To reduce overfitting, the SVM was ensembled
with two other well performing algorithms: AdaBoost and Logistic
Regression. The resulting ensemble received an 83.9% accuracy with
a 84% F1 score. Every AR infant was predicted correctly. Tables 1-6
displays the outcomes of the three individual algorithms, a decision
tree, the ensemble, and the baseline algorithm which is the average
of ten separate weighted random predictions respectively.

3.3 Accuracy versus Interpretability
In selecting an ensemble model, there is an inherent trade-off be-
tween increasing accuracy and decreasing interpretability. We need
our model to be as accurate as possible, but we also need inter-
pretable results for medical professionals where interpretability is
necessary for professional insight and patient and parent trust [27].
Simpler algorithms, such as decision trees, are easily interpretable
compared to ensemble models. We generated several decision trees
to provide explanations to medical specialist on the importance of
specific features in predicting TD and AR.

Specifically, Fig 2 shows the model decision tree resulting from
executing algorithm J48 (C4.5) for the first age range (0 to 6 months).
Unlike the second age range (6 to 12 months), this model obtained
the accuracy of 70.75% with an improvement significantly better
than the baseline. The peculiarity of this model is that the generated
tree uses a single feature of the data set that is the mean acceleration
of the right leg (m_acc_r). Specifically, a mean acceleration value
higher than 2.261074 was always TD implying some connection
with higher accelerations and typical development.

prediction. The ensemble ended with a 77% accuracy and 77% F1
Score. Tables 7-12 list the results for the weighted average baseline,

4 DISCUSSIONS
In this work, we investigated the use of binary classification algo-
rithms applied to day-long sensor movement data to predict typical
or at risk developmental status in infants. Our analysis was split for
0-6 months and 6-12 months, and both final algorithms performed
significantly better than our baseline predictions. It is clear from
our analysis that from 0 to 6 months the kinematic data of AR in-
fants are more distinct than TD, but from 6 to 12 months it becomes
hard to seperate the the two classes. This could be due to the small
sample size. Overall, these results further establish the relationship
between the kinematic features used in the classification algorithms
and infant development.

Working with interpretable and understandable models is very
important in order to obtain knowledge that can be shared with
the medical experts. The top-down model generated in this work
shows the importance of the mean acceleration in the prediction of
AR infants. In fact, the model has found a possible threshold value
(2.261074) above which typical development can be considered for
an infant between 0 and 6 months. Future studies are necessary to
determine the robustness of this classifier and test for relationships
to developmental outcomes.

The nature of this dataset, similar to all small datasets, leads to
the possibility of overfitting as well as lacking representation of the
general population. When using a leave one out cross validation,
the trained models may be picking up noise beyond the true signal
of the pattern which could cause the model to perform poorly on
new unseen instances. We paired our final ensemble model with the
decision tree to provide more interpretable results for healthcare
professionals.

There are several next steps we are pursuing. We would like
to recruit more TD and AR infants for this study. This requires
significant longitudinal interaction with each infant such as tra-
ditional developmental assessment tests, movement sensor tests,
and a check-up at two years old to determine if the infant has a
diagnosed developmental delay.

Currently, each infant visit is treated independently despite hav-
ing three samples per infant. A larger dataset would allow us to
divide the samples by infant rather than by visit, providing more
data about each infant and potentially improving our predictions.
We could also create an algorithm that predicts some movement fea-
ture of an infant at visit three based on the infant’s first two visits.
This prediction algorithm would be helpful if an infant is participat-
ing in a new intensive intervention after their second visit, and the
healthcare professional wants to compare the infant’s movement
results after the intervention to the infant’s predicted movement
pattern from the algorithm that assumes no intervention.

The eventual goal is to use this methodology to predict if an at
risk infant will be diagnosed with a developmental delay. Currently,
developmental delays are often not diagnosed until an infant is two
years old, preventing many infants from receiving early targeted
interventions. Current tools, such as the AIMS score, detect early
signs of atypical development, but they can only detect the extreme
cases. The prediction algorithm we aim to develop would confirm
that developmental delays are reflected in the movement of infants
in the first few months of infancy and thus allow for more infants
to receiver earlier, directed interventions.
