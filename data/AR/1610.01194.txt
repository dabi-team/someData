ABSTRACT

Context. The study of the radial variations of metallicity across the Galactic disc is a powerful method for understanding the history
of star formation and chemical evolution of the Milky Way. Although several studies about gradients have been performed so far, the
knowledge of the Galactic antincentre is still poor.
Aims. This work aims to determine accurately the physical and chemical properties of a sample of H ii regions located at RG >11 kpc
and to study the radial distribution of abundances in the outermost part of the Galaxy disc.
Methods. We carried out new optical spectroscopic observations of nine H ii regions with the William Herschel Telescope covering
the spectral range from 3500 Å to 10100Å. In addition, we increased the sample by searching the literature for optical observations of
regions towards the Galactic anticentre, re-analysing them to obtain a single sample of 23 objects to be processed in a homogeneous
and consistent manner. The total sample distribution covers the Galactocentric radius from 11 kpc to 18 kpc.
Results. Emission line ratios were used to determine accurate electron densities and temperatures of several ionic species in 13
H ii regions. These physical parameters were applied to the spectra to determine direct total chemical abundances. For those regions
without direct estimations of temperature, chemical abundances were derived by performing tailor-made photoionisation models
and/or by using an empirical relation obtained from radio recombination and optical temperatures.
We performed weighted least-squares ﬁts to the distribution of the derived abundances along the Galactocentric distances to study the
radial gradients of metallicity across the outermost part of the MW. The distributions O/H, N/H, S/H, and Ar/H towards the anticentre
can be represented by decreasing linear radial gradients, while in the case of N/O abundances the radial distribution is better ﬁtted
with a two-zone model. The He/H radial gradient is presented here for the ﬁrst time; we ﬁnd a slope that is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from zero. The derived gradient for oxygen shows a clear decrease with distance with a slope of -0.053±0.009 dex kpc−1. Although a
shallower slope at large Galactocentric distances is suggested by our data, the ﬂattening of the distribution cannot be conﬁrmed and
more objects towards the anticentre need to be studied in order to establish the true form of the metallicity gradient.

Key words. ISM: abundances – HII regions – Galaxy: abundances – Galaxy: disc – Galaxy: evolution

1. Introduction

The chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) varies
between galaxies and is both position and time dependent within
a galaxy. Since the nucleosynthesis of diﬀerent elements occurs
in stars of diﬀerent masses, the study of chemical abundances in
the discs of spiral galaxies is a powerful method for understand-
ing the history of star formation and evolution of galaxies.

A knowledge of the radial variations of metallicity across
the galactic disc (i.e. abundance gradients) is central to our un-
derstanding of a wide variety of observed phenomena, including
the physics of star formation rates (Phillipps & Edmunds 1991),
initial mass function (Guesten & Mezger 1982), the radial
inﬂows/outﬂows of gas (Mayor & Vigroux 1981), and the stellar
evolution and the process of nucleosythesis itself. Galactic
abundance gradients in the ISM were ﬁrst described by Searle
(1971) in a survey of H ii regions in six late-type spiral galaxies.
Since then, considerable eﬀort has been made to establish the
chemical distribution in the Milky Way (MW) by studying
many sources such as supernova remnants (SNR) (Binette et al.
1982), molecular clouds (Rudolph et al. 1996), open clusters
(Twarog et al. 1997; Andreuzzi et al. 2011), cepheids (Luck
et al. 2003; Korotin et al. 2014), OB stars (Rolleston et al.

(cid:63) e-mail: alba@iaa.es

2000), and planetary nebulae (PNe) (Maciel & Koppen 1994;
Henry et al. 2010). However, when deriving the abundances
representative of the current ISM values, H ii regions provide
the most accessible probe of abundances gradients. Since they
are bright and hot they emit strongly in many lines observable
over much of the MW. Unlike stars, H ii regions probe the
current state of abundances, and unlike PNe and SNR, do not
contaminate the surrounding ISM.

The existence of a large-scale gradient in the MW with
H ii regions was established by the pioneering work of Shaver et
al. (1983), who found a decrease of metallicity with Galactic dis-
tances. Subsequently, several studies with H ii regions (Hawley
1978; Talent & Dufour 1979; Fich & Silkey 1991; Hunter 1992;
Aﬄerbach et al. 1997; V´ılchez & Esteban 1996; Deharveng et
al. 2000; Rudolph et al. 2006) have been carried out, ﬁrmly es-
tablishing the existence of a negative gradient of abundance of
the elements heavier than helium in the disc of the MW.

Nonetheless, the sampling of the whole Galactic disc is still
poor. In particular, relatively few H ii regions have been studied
towards the Galactic anticentre region. Optically, there are only
ten Galactic H ii regions which have been observed at RG >11
kpc and for which direct measurements of the electron temper-
ature are available. This is also a handicap for the MW stud-

ies, compared with those for nearby external galaxies, and limits
the application of models of galactic evolution. In particular, it
limits those aspect of the models that describe the evolution of
the outermost parts of the disc, which might be considered –
at least from the point of view of the chemical evolution – to
be much closer to the pre-galactic/early conditions in the MW.
Moreover, the possibility of variations in the slope of the gra-
dients in the outer disc has been a subject of debate in the past
years. Some authors have claimed that radial abundance gradi-
ents of some elements may ﬂatten out at the outer parts of the
Galactic disc (Fich & Silkey 1991; V´ılchez & Esteban 1996),
while other authors do not support such ﬂattening (Deharveng et
al. 2000; Rudolph et al. 2006).

Therefore, extending the measurement of abundances to
large Galactocentric distances in the MW is essential to our
understanding of the metallicity gradient and the chemical
evolution of our Galaxy.

This paper has two main purposes. The ﬁrst is to present new
long-slit observations in a wide spectral range of H ii regions lo-
cated towards the Galactic anticentre with Galactocentric dis-
tances from 11 kpc to 17 kpc. The second is to present a re-
determination of chemical abundances, from direct electron tem-
peratures and from physical modelling, of all the optical outer-
most H ii regions observations in the literature in a homogeneous
and consistent manner to perform a self-consistent study of the
chemical gradients towards the outermost disc of the MW. The
wide optical spectral range covered, together with the consis-
tent chemical analysis of the sample, allowed us to give an ac-
curate description of the radial chemical distribution towards the
Galactic anticentre up to a distance of 18 kpc.

In the following section we present the data sample including
our own observations and other data from the literature. Section
3 describes the analysis and the results of the study, while Sect.
4 is devoted to discussing the resulting abundance gradients and
their implications in the context of Galactic evolution. Finally,
we describe the main conclusions of this work in Sect. 5.

2. Sample of H ii regions

This work aims to study the chemical abundances of H ii regions
located towards the Galactic anticentre. Therefore we selected
Galactic H ii regions in the direction of the anticentre with RG >
11 kpc from catalogues of Fich & Blitz (1984), Deharveng et al.
(2000), and Quireza et al. (2006). The mother sample includes
89 anticentre H ii regions observable from the northern hemi-
sphere.

2.1. Selection and observations of WHT data

We selected for our observations those H ii regions from the
mother sample located at the furthest distance from the Galactic
centre and, if possible, with available information on their ther-
mal structure (e.g. a radio continuum temperature). Nine H ii re-
gions located at 11 kpc < RG < 17 kpc were observed; their
names and positions are listed in Table 1.

The observations were carried out in December 2009 and
July 2010 using the ISIS double-armed spectrograph at the 4.2 m
William Herschel Telescope (WHT) at the Observatorio del
Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain). A dichroic was set
at ∼5336 Å permitting simultaneous observation in the blue and
red arms, which are optimised for their respective wavelength
ranges. The blue arm detector, EEV12, is an array of 4096×2048
(13.5 µm) pixels giving a spatial resolution of 0.2 arcsec/pix,
while the CCD for the ISIS red arm, RED+, is a red-sensitive
array of 4096×2048 (15.0 µm) with a spatial resolution of 0.22
arcsec/pix. The gratings were chosen in order to obtain as much
information as possible on the most important emission lines of
the optical range. In the blue arm, the R300B grating was centred
at 4400 Å covering the eﬀective spectral range from 3200 Å to
5800 Å with a dispersion of 0.86 Å/pix, giving a spectral reso-
lution of R = λ/δλ ∼1070 at 4400 Å. In the red arm, the R158R
was centred at 7800 Å covering the eﬀective spectral range from
5300 Å to 10000 Å with a dispersion of 1.81 Å/pix and a spectral
resolution of R∼1010 at 7800 Å.

Table 1 also shows the observational log for the H ii regions
of the observed sample. At least three exposures were taken

in each region with diﬀerent exposition times depending on
the object. The slit width was set at 1 arcsec throughout the
observation and oriented in parallactic angle to avoid diﬀerential
atmospheric refraction problems. The necessary bias frames,
continuum, arcs, and spectrophotometric standard stars were
also acquired.

The spectra were reduced using IRAF1 by following the stan-
dard procedure for 2D spectroscopic observations (bias subtrac-
tion, ﬂat-ﬁelding, and cosmic ray rejection). The wavelength cal-
ibration was made using CuNe+CuAr arcs taken shortly after
the object spectrum was taken. Two spectrophotometric stan-
dard stars were observed each night (G191-B2B and HR345
in December 2009, and BD+26 2603 and BD+17 4708 in July
2010) so that the spectra could be ﬂux calibrated.

For each exposure, a background region was selected in or-
der to avoid nebular emission or stars. Pixels of these regions
were combined with a median in a single spectrum and a 2D
background spectrum was created with the value of the com-
bined spectrum in each column. This sky background was sub-
sequently subtracted from every science object. This method was
used in all the H ii regions except for S162 where the S156-sky
was used for the sky subtraction since S162 was too extended
and no area without nebular emission was found. The sky sub-
traction worked well overall; only the strongest sky-lines in the
far red spectra (λ >9000 Å) left some residuals.

1 The Image Reduction and Analysis Facility IRAF is distributed by
the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by
the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under
cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.

In order to select the zones to extract the 1D spectra we ex-
amined the spatial proﬁles of the most important emission lines,
whenever possible selecting areas with emission of the auroral
lines necessary to estimate the electron temperature. The spectra
were traced and extracted using the APALL task in IRAF with an
aperture optimised for a good S/N which was able to minimise
the contamination of adjacent pixels; in this process we took into
account the diﬀerent spatial scales between blue and red arms.
Eighteen spectra were ﬁnally extracted over the sample. In Fig.
1 we present four representative examples showing the auroral
lines necessary to estimate electron temperatures.

2.2. Additional data from the literature

To realise a more extensive study of the Galactic anticentre, the
sample was increased with H ii regions from previous works.
With this aim, we carried out an exhaustive bibliographical re-
view, selecting those H ii regions located at RG >11 kpc observed
in the optical range and with measurements of the electron tem-
perature sensitive lines or, at least, with information about the
[S iii]λ9068 line to obtain chemical abundances by means of in-
dividual photoionozation models.

As a result of this search we found 14 H ii regions that sat-
isfy the stipulated requirements: S98, S127, S128, S209, S219,
S266 (B), S283, and S203 (BFS31) from V´ılchez & Esteban
(1996); S255 (c), S301 (RCW6), and S311 (RCW16a) from
Shaver et al. (1983); S158 (P1) from Talent & Dufour (1979);
S206 from Caplan et al. (2000); and S298 (B2) from Esteban
et al. (1990). Some authors provide information about regions
in several pointings; in these cases we chose those with more

emission lines measured (in parentheses we indicate the point-
ing selected for our study and the identiﬁcation given by each
author).

2.3. Final sample

The ﬁnal sample to be analysed in this work includes both
samples described above (Sects. 2.1 and 2.2) and consists of
23 H ii regions located in a range of Galactoncentric distances
from 11 kpc to 18 kpc. In Table 2 we present a summary of the
fundamental physical parameters of the H ii regions analysed in
this study. Each H ii region is identiﬁed in Col. 1 by its Sharpless
number (Sharpless 1959). Columns 2 and 3 give the Galactic
coordinates (l,b). Columns 4 and 5 give the Galactocentric and
heliocentric distances (RG and d(cid:12)), both of which are analysed
and justiﬁed in Sect. 4.1. Column 6 shows the distance above
the Galactic plane (z), and Col. 7 gives the angular size of the
nebula (Θ). In Col. 9 we show the spectral type of the dominant
exciting star. Column 10 gives the electron temperature derived
from radio observations (t∗
e) and, ﬁnally, Col. 11 indicates other
identiﬁcation names. The corresponding references are given in
the footnotes.

3. Analysis and results

3.1. Line intensities and reddening correction

We now report on the method used to obtain the line intensities
of the regions observed with ISIS (our own sample). Line ﬂuxes
were measured by integrating all the ﬂux in the line between two
given limits and over a ﬁtted local continuum. Partially blended
lines, such Hα and [N ii]λλ6548,6584, were deblended with two
or three Gaussian proﬁles to measure the individual line ﬂuxes.
All the measurement were made with the SPLOT task of IRAF.
The statistical errors associated with the observed ﬂuxes were
calculated using the expression
σ1 = σcN1/2[1 + EW/(N∆)]1/2,

(1)

where σ1 represents the error in the observed line ﬂux, N is the
number of pixels used to measure the line, EW the line equiva-
lent width, σc the standard deviation of the continuum in a box
near the line, and ∆ represents the dispersion in Å/pix (P´erez-
Montero & D´ıaz 2003).

The reddening coeﬃcient c(Hβ) was derived from the ob-
served ﬂux ratios of the brightest Balmer lines Hα/Hβ, Hγ/Hβ,
and Hδ/Hβ as compared with the theoretical values obtained
from the public software of Storey & Hummer (1995) assuming
Case B recombination and following an iterative process with
the ne and te estimations (Sect. 3.2). To minimise the reddening
eﬀect and to avoid error propagation due to diﬀerences between
red and blue grating calibrations, the measured lines were red-
dening corrected relative to Hβ, Hα, or P10 (if S/N>5) depend-
ing on the spectral range and later normalised to Hβ ﬂux using
the corresponding theoretical ratios.

Table 3 lists the reddening-corrected intensities of the emis-
sion lines measured for every observed H ii region labelled with
their standard identiﬁcation. The third column gives the adopted
reddening function, f(λ), using the extinction law by Cardelli et
al. (1989) with RV = 3.1. Errors in the emission line intensi-
ties were derived by propagating the observational errors in the
ﬂuxes and the reddening constant uncertainties. The estimated
ﬂuxes and errors were normalised to F(Hβ)=1000. The values
obtained for c(Hβ) are also presented in the last row of Table 3.

4

At zero redshift the [S iii]λ9530Å line ﬂuxes are strongly
aﬀected by a sky absorption band. Therefore, this line was
not used for the derivation of the [S iii] electron temperature
neither for the S++/H+ ionic abundance. For these quantities a
theoretical ratio [S iii]λ9530/[S iii]λ9069=2.44 was assumed.

The methodology used to obtain the intensities of the H ii re-
gions selected from the literature was diﬀerent since in these re-
gions we did not measure the ﬂuxes in spectra. In this case, we
calculated the original reddened ﬂuxes considering the extinc-
tion law and c(Hβ) used by each author and later we re-derived
the intensities following the same self-consistent method as in
our regions: theoretical Balmer lines with Case B recombination,
iterative process with ne and te, and reddening function using the
extinction law by Cardelli et al. (1989) with RV = 3.1. Finally,
we obtained consistent intensities derived exactly under the same
conditions as in our sample. Data from these 14 H ii regions were
added to our new observations reported here to create a data set
of 23 H ii regions with 11 kpc < RG < 18 kpc. Hereafter we work
with all of these objects as a single sample following the same
methodology for both samples.

3.2. Physical parameters

To obtain the physical conditions of the gas, we performed
an iterative process for each region until an agreement was
achieved between electron density (ne) and electron temperature
(te). The values for te and ne derived for each H ii region are
shown in Table 4. Those regions without measurements of auro-
ral lines necessary to estimate at least one electron temperature
were discarded temporarily. Physical parameters and chemical
abundances were not derived with this direct method for any of
them and, therefore, they are not included in Table 4 (but see
Sects. 3.4 and 3.5).

Electron density, ne, was calculated for all the observed
regions from the [S ii]λλ6717,6731 line ratio using the IRAF
package TEMDEN based on a ﬁve-level statistical equilibrium
model (De Robertis et al. 1987; Shaw & Dufour 1995). Electron
temperatures, te, were derived using the appropriate line ratios
RN2, RO3, RS3, RO2, and R(cid:48)
S2 following the equations below for
each ion:
te([N ii]) = 0.537 + 0.000253 RN2 + 42.126/RN2;
te([O iii]) = 0.8254 − 0.0002415 RO3 + 47.77/RO3;
te([S iii]) = [RS 3 + 36.4] / [1.8 RS 3 − 3.01] ;

(3)

(2)

(4)

te([O ii]) = a0(ne) + a1(ne) RO2 + a2(ne)/RO2,
where a0(ne) = 0.23 − 0.005 ne − 0.17/ne

a1(ne) = 0.007 + 0.000009 ne + 0.0064/ne
a2(ne) = 38.3 − 0.021 ne − 1.64/ne;

(5)

te([S ii]) = a0(ne) + a1(ne) R(cid:48)
S 2

+ a2(ne)/R(cid:48)
S 2

+ a3(ne)/R(cid:48)2
S 2,

where a0(ne) = 1.92 − 0.0017 ne + 0.848/ne

a1(ne) = −0.0375 + 4.038 10−5 ne − 0.0185/ne
a2(ne) = −14.15 + 0.019 ne − 10.4/ne
a3(ne) = 105.64 + 0.019 ne + 58.52/ne.
(6)
In all the equations, electron density is in units of cm−3 and
electron temperatures in units of 104 K.

E Electron temperatures derived from other te (see text for details).
† In region S158 te([S iii]) has S/N<3. This fact was taken into account when deriving abundances.

Our criterion in the determination of the electron temperature
was to derive at least one temperature characteristic for each ion-
isation degree: te([O iii]) as the high-ionisation zone, te([S iii]) as
the medium-ionisation zone, and te([N ii]), te([S ii]), or te([O ii])
as the low-ionisation zone. However, not all the necessary auro-

ral lines were detected in all the regions (we did not estimate te
for all the ions). For S206, S298, and S301 no auroral line asso-

ciated with a low-excitation ion was observed and we resorted to
the expression

te([O ii]) =

1.2 + 0.002 ne + 4.2/ne
te([O iii])−1 + 0.08 + 0.003 ne + 2.5/ne
which relates te([O ii]) with te([O iii]) (P´erez-Montero & Contini
2009). Equation 7 was also used for S127 and S128, in which
we inferred te([O iii]) from te([O ii]). In the case of S132, S158,
and S255 we estimated te([O iii]) by using the relation

te([O iii]) =

te([N ii])

obtained from P´erez-Montero & Contini (2009). A similar
scenario occurs when deriving te([S iii]) in regions in which
[S iii]λ6312 and [S iii]λλ9068,9530 were not measured simulta-
neously (S127, S128, S158, S298, S301, and S311). For the-
ses objects we resorted to the expression proposed by P´erez-
Montero & D´ıaz (2003) that relates te([S iii]) with te([O iii]):
te([S iii]) = 1.19 te([O iii]) − 0.32.

(9)

Equations 7 and 8 are based on photoionisation models, while
equation 9 was obtained with observational data. Electron
temperatures estimated with these methods are quoted in Table
4 labelled with the subscript E.

Although the intensities of the necessary auroral lines are
relatively reliable, the estimation of the electron temperature
is not exempt from problems. There are several sources of

6

uncertainty that need to be mentioned because the variations
in the temperature would involve oﬀsets in the chemical
abundances. Kennicutt et al. (2003) compare the consistency
of electron temperatures measured from diﬀerent ions based
on observation of H ii regions in M101. They ﬁnd that the
temperatures derived from the [O ii]λ7325 line show a large
scatter and are nearly uncorrelated with temperatures derived
from other ions. The source of this disagreement remains
unresolved, but they speculate on possible sources such as
dielectronic recombination, collisional de-excitation, radiative
transfer eﬀects, and observational uncertainties. On the other
hand, Binette et al. (2012) analyse pairs of [O ii] and [S ii] tem-
peratures in H ii regions ﬁnding that Te([O iii]) appears to be
higher than Te([S iii]) in objects with Te([S iii]) lower than
14000 K. They perform photoionisation models to look for
an explanation for this trend and conclude that models with
metallicity inhomogeneities or with shock waves that propagate
in the photoionised gas successfully reproduce the observed
excess in Te([O iii]) temperatures.

In order to determine the uncertainties in physical parameters
and to analyse possible discrepancies between electron temper-
atures associated with diﬀerent ions, we performed diagnostic
diagrams that show te dependences with ne and vice versa. We
represented extreme values of te and ne characterised by the ﬂux
ratios and their observational errors obtaining diagnostic bands
that allow us to visualise the electron temperature structure in
the ionised gas.

Fern´andez−Mart´ın et al.: Anticentre chemical distribution

Figure 2 shows the diagnostic diagrams generated for the
WHT regions with direct estimation of te: S83, S132, S156,
S162, and S212. We show the electron density and its de-
pendence with te in blue. Yellow, red, and green bands repre-
sent electron temperatures independent of density, respectively
te([N ii]), te([O iii]), and te([S iii]). Finally, we represent the sin-
gle electron temperature sensitive to density, te([S ii]), in purple.
The criterion used to paint the parameters is arbitrary and the
parameters are represented giving preference to some of them
following this order: te([S iii]) - te([O iii]) - te([N ii]) - te([S ii]) -
ne. For this reason, in some regions certain temperatures are not
clearly observed because they are hidden behind others.

Analysing the density variations, we found that S83, S132,
and S212 always show medium densities with values between
150 cm−3 and 400 cm−3, while S156 and S162 present higher
densities with a wider range of values, from 800 cm−3 to
2000 cm−3, for a given temperature. In general, the agreement
between electron temperatures is very good, and it is possible
to appreciate the consistency both for te ranges of diﬀerent ions
at estimated ne and for values presented in Table 4. The elec-
tron temperature associated with [S iii] is the only one that shows
lower values than the others in three regions for a ﬁxed density;
this has been taken into account for the derivation of ionic abun-
dances, as we show in the next section.

3.3. Direct chemical abundances
The ionic chemical abundances of the diﬀerent species were es-
timated from the forbidden-to-hydrogen emission line ratios of
the strongest available emission lines detected in the analysed
spectra. We resorted to the functional forms given by H¨agele et
al. (2008) which are based on the package IONIC of IRAF. To de-
termine the single ionised helium abundance we used the equa-
tions proposed by Olive & Skillman (2004). We checked that
results for He+/H+ with this method do not diﬀer more than ∼3
per cent from values estimated with recent emissivities proposed
by Porter et al. (2013). We also calculated the mean weighted by
the errors of the ﬁve observed He i lines (He iλ4026, He iλ4471,
He iλ5875, He iλ6678, and He iλ7065). The ionic abundances of
the diﬀerent elements with respect to ionised hydrogen along
with their corresponding errors are given in Table 5.

and te([Ne iii])=te([O iii])

To estimate the chemical abundances, electron density and
temperature were required. We derived each ionic abundance
with its corresponding electron temperature, if it was possible.
In this way we estimated O+ with te([O ii]) , O2+ with te([O iii]),
S+ with te([S ii]), S2+ with te([S iii]), and N+ with te([N ii]). In
the case of argon we assumed te([Ar iii])=te([S iii]) (Garnett
1992), while for iron, helium, and neon the ionic abundances
were derived under the assumption that te([Fe iii])=te([O iii]),
te(He i)=te([O iii]),
(Peimbert &
Costero 1969). For those regions where not all the electron
temperatures were derived we assumed an ionisation structure:
the adopted criterion was to derive abundances with electron
temperatures related with ions with the same excitation degree
and similar ionisation potential. Nonetheless, we must bear in
mind that assuming that temperatures are uniform in a given
ionisation zone, our results can be subject to slight changes
if we consider the presence of temperature inhomogeneities
(Esteban et al. 2009; Mesa-Delgado & Esteban 2010; Stasi´nska
et al. 2013). The temperature ﬂuctuation paradigm was pro-
posed by Peimbert (1967) and it is characterised by the mean
square of the spatial distribution of temperature (the so-called
temperature ﬂuctuation parameter t2). Our direct chemical
abundances are derived using the standard method based on

collisional excited lines (CELs), which have a strong depen-
dence on Te; therefore, temperature ﬂuctuations can result in an
underestimation of the absolute abundances of the ionised gas.
This will be considered in the analysis of the chemical gradients.

The total abundances were derived by taking into account,
when required, the unseen ionisation stages of each element,
using the appropriate ionisation correction factor (ICF) for each
species. The O/H was obtained by directly adding the two ionic
abundances (O/H∼O+/H++O2+/H+). The N/O can be approxi-
mated to N+/O+ and the N/H ratio as N/H∼(N/O)×(O/H). Due
to the spectral range of our observations, no [S iv] line was
observed, but – by taking the excitation condition into account
– a relatively important contribution from S3+ may be expected
in these H ii regions. Therefore, the total sulfur abundance was
inferred using the ICF(S++S2+) proposed by Barker (1980).
The total abundances of neon and argon were calculated using
the ionisation correction factors ICF(Ne2+) and ICF(Ar2+),
respectively, given by P´erez-Montero et al. (2007). The total
abundance of iron was inferred using the ICF(Fe2+) proposed
by Rodr´ıguez & Rubin (2004). Finally, in the case of helium
we do not detect the He iiλ4686 line (belonging to the observed
spectral range) in any region and we can assume that He2+=0.
On the other hand, it is expected that the contribution of the
unobservable neutral helium was important. In this work, we
adopted the ICF(He++He2+) proposed by Peimbert et al. (1992)
to consider the He0 contribution. In Table 5 we present the
total direct abundances and the ICFs derived along with their
corresponding errors.

3.4. Tailor-made photoionisation models

For those regions without a detection of any auroral temperature-
sensitive emission line (e.g. [N ii]λ5755, [O iii]λ4363) we were
not able to derive chemical abundances following the direct
method. Instead, it is possible to apply methods based on strong
emission line ratios, such as R23, O3N2, or S23. However, most
of these methods have been calibrated for massive star-forming
complexes whose scales and properties do not match those in
our sample of nebulae ionised by single stars in the disc of the
Galaxy. As an alternative, we can resort to tailor-made photoion-
isation models covering the observed properties of these objects.

In Table 2 we showed the spectral type of the dominant ex-
citing stars of the sample. These spectral types were derived by
diﬀerent authors using diﬀerent methods, and great discrepan-
cies among authors in spectral types for the same star are found.
For this reason, and in order to work with a self-consistent sam-
ple, we decided to estimate representative eﬀective temperatures
resorting to the η(cid:48) parameter instead of that derived from the
spectral type in Table 2.

The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the ionising stars
can be obtained from the observed emission line ratios using ap-
propriate diagnostic diagrams that yield a stellar eﬀective tem-
perature. This is the case of the η parameter (Vilchez & Pagel
1988), deﬁned as

η = O+/O2+
S+/S2+ ,

erations before a solution is found is around 50, with the excep-
tion of S203 and S209 where no reliable solutions were found.
In the former region, the relatively very high [O iii]/Hβ ratios is
possibly due to a density-bounded geometry and in the latter to
possible aperture eﬀects.

The obtained properties from the resulting models, including
L(Hβ), external radius, oxygen abundance, and N/O ratios are
summarised in Table 6. Figure 4 shows the agreement between
the four observed quantities and the found solutions. With the
exception of [O ii]/Hβ in S98 and S283, errors in the accuracy of

which is sensitive to the hardness of the ionising spectral energy
distribution. When the ionic abundances cannot be derived, it is
possible to use the η(cid:48) parameter based on emission lines:

η(cid:48) =

[O ii]3727/[O iii]4959, 5007
[S ii]6717, 6731/[S iii]9069, 9532

.

(11)

Although this parameter mainly correlates with the stellar
eﬀective temperature,
it also has an additional dependence
on electron temperature and, hence, on chemical abundance.
We then used the calibration of the η(cid:48) parameter presented by
P´erez-Montero et al. (2014) based on ﬁttings to models with
WM-Basic (Pauldrach et al. 2001) single stars at a metallicity
Z=0.2 Z(cid:12) close to the expected values for this subsample. The
η(cid:48) criterion limits the use of models when deriving chemical
abundances to those H ii regions with the four involved emis-
sion lines. All the H ii regions with measures of [O ii]λ3727,
[O iii]λ5007, [S ii]λλ6717,6731, and [S iii]λ9069 are shown
along with the models used to derive the eﬀective temperature
in Fig. 3.

Once the ionising SEDs were established, we used the pho-
toionisation code Cloudy v13.03 (Ferland et al. 2013) using as
input conditions a constant density in the gas according to the
value derived from the ratio of [S ii] emission lines and a dust-
to-gas ratio with a standard value of 2×10−3. All models have
a radiation-bounded geometry and the stopping criterion is that
99% of the H atoms are ionised. The models for each region
are repeated in an iterative process varying Q(H), the inner ra-
dius, the number of hydrogen ionising photons, the abundance
of all elements scaled to oxygen, and the nitrogen-to-oxygen ra-
tio that most closely reproduces the observed [O ii]λ3727/Hβ,
[O iii]λ5007/Hβ, [N ii]λ6584/[O ii]λ3727, and the Hβ luminosity.
In the S208, S219, S266, and S270 regions, the [O iii]λ5007 line
is not detected or it has a very weak ﬂux, so we considered an
upper limit of this line two times the uncertainty associated with
the continuum at the same wavelength. The typical number of it-

With the intention of establishing a relation to convert t∗
e into
optical electron temperatures te which are relevant in abundance
determinations, we ﬁrst checked the literature for studies with re-
liable estimations of radio temperatures (see Col. 9 of Table 2).
Later, we compared these values with our optical electron tem-
peratures derived from the [O iii] lines (see Col. 4 of Table 4) for
H ii regions in common. Figure 5 shows optical electron temper-
atures, te([O iii]), derived in this work as a function of the radio
temperatures, t∗
e, adopted from the literature. Each point repre-
sents an H ii region with radio temperatures being a weighted
mean of determinations from Quireza et al. (2006) and Balser et
al. (2011). Despite the reduced number of regions, the obtained
relation is described by the weighted ﬁt
te([O iii]) = (0.175 ± 0.080) + (0.792 ± 0.081) × t∗
e

(12)

This result diﬀers from that established by Shaver et al.
(1983), who found that the weighted average of the ratio of
=1.06± 0.02, with the result
these temperatures is te([O iii])/t∗
e
that the slope derived here is smaller than their value. Their
relation was obtained from only six H ii regions located close
to the Sun, but we have not found other studies in the literature
that can be compared with our results.

We applied the relation obtained to those regions of the sam-
ple without direct estimations of optical temperatures, but with
information of radio temperature from the literature (S98, S209,
and S228). Once te([O iii]) was estimated for each region us-
ing Eq. 12, we calculated temperatures associated with other
ions with diﬀerent ionisation degrees (te([N ii]) with Eq. 8 and
te([S iii]) with Eq. 9). Finally, we inferred chemical abundances
following the same procedure as for regions with observable au-
roral lines (Sect. 3.3). Electron temperatures, ionic abundances,
and chemical abundances derived with this method are shown in
Table 7. For two regions, S98 and S288, chemical abundances

the adjustments are less than 1 per cent for Hβ luminosity, 5 per
cent for [O iii]/Hβ and [N ii]/[O ii], and 10 per cent for [O ii]/Hβ.
In S98 and S283 the observed very high value of [O ii]/Hβ is pos-
sibly due to some contamination from the diﬀuse gas. In the last
row of Fig. 4 we also show the comparison between chemical
abundances obtained from models (Table 6) with those derived
with the direct method (Table 5). As can be seen, the results
from the two methods are in good agreement showing that the
two treatments are consistent.

3.5. Relation between radio and optical electron

temperatures

In this subsection we perform a comparative analysis of the opti-
cal and radio electron temperatures to derive a relation between
them. Since there is a large sample of nebulae widely distributed
across the Galactic disc with estimations of electron tempera-
tures based on radio recombination lines (RRL) and continuum
data, this relation could be used to obtain the optical temperature
and to calculate chemical abundances in those cases without de-
tectable optical auroral lines.

Most of the observed emission lines in ionised nebulae are
collisionally excited and their intensities depend exponentially
on temperature. This temperature can be determined from ap-
propriate line ratios. However, these ratios involve the detection
and measurement of auroral lines which are intrinsically weak
and remain undetected in many objects. On the other hand, most
of the radio emission observed from H ii regions is continuum
radiation produced by free-free thermal bremsstrahlung in the
plasma. At high frequencies the nebular gas is optically thin,
and the ratio between the brightness temperature of a RRL
and that of a free-free emission continuum depends on the
radio frequency and the gas temperature. Thus, the observed
RRL-to-continuum ratio can be used to estimate the electron
temperature of the H ii regions (Rohlfs & Wilson 2000). Because
the RRLs are not obscured by interstellar dust, relatively faint
H ii regions at large distances from the Sun can be detected,
allowing radio electron temperatures t∗
e to be estimated more
easily than with optical auroral lines.

because it agrees with the value proposed by Balser et al. (2011),
whose estimation will be used for other regions (see below).

Five regions of our sample do not have distances estimated
by Caplan et al. (2000) or Quireza et al. (2006). For these re-
gions, we decided to use works that derive distances with the
same methodology. To this end, we adopt distances derived by
Fich & Silkey (1991) for S98, S266, S270, and S283 and by
Balser et al. (2011) for S98. These ﬁve regions are not individu-
ally catalogued in any other study of kinematical distances. Both
Fich & Silkey (1991) and Balser et al. (2011) derive kinematic
distances with R(cid:12)=8.5 kpc and θ=220 km s−1, although Fich &
Silkey (1991) use a ﬂat rotation curve instead a curve from Brand
& Blitz (1993).

Here we have thus chosen to use only these kinematic deter-
minations of the RG of our sources, obtaining a sample with con-
sistent Galactocentric radius. Figure 6 shows the distribution of
the 22 H ii regions with derived chemical abundances projected
onto the Galactic plane and plotted as function of the Galactic
longitude and Galactic radius. They cover the anticentre range
of distances from ∼11 kpc to ∼18 kpc.

4.2. Abundance gradients of O/H, N/H, N/O, S/H, Ar/H, and

He/H towards the Galactic anticentre

From the derived abundances shown in Tables 5, 6, and 7, we can
study the radial distribution of chemical abundances along the
Galactic anticentre. Figures 7 through 12 show the total chemi-
cal abundances of O/H, N/H, N/O, S/H, Ar/H, and He/H, respec-
tively, plotted against Galactocentric distances for the H ii re-

were also estimated resorting to the photoionisation models de-
scribed in the previous section; as can be seen (Tables 6 and 7),
both derivations are consistent within errors.

4. Discussion

4.1. Galactocentric distances of the H ii regions

The study of abundance gradients in galaxies is strongly aﬀected
by the uncertainty in galactocentric distance: it can aﬀect the
slope and, therefore, the interpretation of the results. The main
diﬃculty in establishing the parameters shown in Cols. 4 and 5
of Table 2 was to decide what Galactocentric radius of the H ii re-
gions to adopt in this work. We searched in the literature for the
most accurate distances for our sample, and found several pre-
vious works which used diﬀerent methods: stellar photometry,
kinematical, or mixed techniques. In order to generate a self-
consistent sample and to minimise the eﬀects of inaccuracies in
distances, we selected Galactic and heliocentric distances from
the same catalogue for all the regions whenever possible.

Taking these considerations into account, in a ﬁrst attempt,
we adopted the Galactocentric distances from Caplan et al.
(2000) and Quireza et al. (2006). From these works we obtained
information about RG and d(cid:12) for 17 H ii regions (77% of the sam-
ple). Both groups of authors use the same method, deriving dis-
tances kinematically from the observed nebular recombination
line local standard of rest (LSR) velocity, assuming the Brand
& Blitz (1993) Galactic rotation curve and placing the Sun at a
Galactocentric distance of R(cid:12)=8.5 kpc orbiting the Galactic cen-
tre at a LSR circular velocity of θ=220 km s−1. The two works
complement each other well since they give distances for dif-
ferent regions or similar estimations for those regions listed in
both works. Only in the case of S212 do Caplan et al. (2000) and
Quireza et al. (2006) diﬀer in the derived distances, estimating
RG=14.8 kpc and 16.7 kpc, respectively. We adopted the latter

gions with chemical abundances inferred in this work. To make
it easier to distinguish between the three methods used to de-
termine abundances, the regions with direct Te are plotted as
red circles, results from tailor-made models are represented with
black stars, and abundances obtained from the te-t∗
e relation are
shown as blue squares. Regions with abundances that are upper
or lower limits are represented by arrows in the ﬁgures, but they
have not been taken into account in any ﬁtting.

To determine linear gradients we performed a least-squares
ﬁtting weighted by abundance uncertainties. Data from the three
methods (except limit abundances) were combined into a single
ﬁt and plotted as solid lines in the ﬁgures. We also computed
gradients using only abundances derived for the H ii regions
with direct determinations of Te; however, for simplicity, they
are not represented in the ﬁgures. The ﬁnal abundance gradients
are presented in Table 8. Regions with chemical abundances de-
rived with two methods (S98 and S228) are represented twice
in the ﬁgures, but are only consider once in the performed ﬁts;
as the representative value we took the weighted mean by er-
rors of the two methods. In addition, it is interesting to note that
those abundances estimated using the electron temperature de-
rived from the relation between optical and radio temperatures
(blue squares) follow the same tendency as abundances derived
with the direct method and, in general, they agree with the ﬁts
obtained.

To compare our results with other works, in Table 9 we
present a summary of all the gradients obtained by diﬀerent
authors from H ii regions in the inner and outer Galaxy in several
spectral ranges. The extrapolated radial gradients obtained by
Rudolph et al. (2006) with optical data are also represented
in graphics as dashed lines. These come from a selection of
previous works for a large range of Galactocentric distances
shown here for the sake of comparison with a suggestion of
ﬂattening in the outer parts of the disc.

The radial distribution of the oxygen abundance is presented
in Fig. 7 and it clearly shows a decrease with Galactocentric
distance. Within the range of distances between 11 and 18

with abundances estimated with direct methods, black squares

dances that are upper or lower limits are represented by ar-
rows. The solid line represents the least-squares weighted ﬁt per-
formed to all the data (except limits abundances), while the ex-
trapolated gradient from Rudolph et al. (2006) is represented by

kpc, the maximum variation goes from 12+log(O/H)=8.44 to
12+log(O/H)=8.05. The results obtained by computing the ﬁt
with all the regions and by using oly the abundances derived
with the direct method (Table 5) are consistent, taking the asso-
ciated uncertainties into account; the slope of the latter is slightly
steeper.

When comparing our results with those for the inner parts
of the Galaxy, we ﬁnd that our slope is clearly shallower than
the one obtained by Shaver et al. (1983), but in general their
ﬁts have steeper slopes than many others in the literature. In
addition, our result is in very good agreement with the gradient
obtained by Aﬄerbach et al. (1997) with infrared data. The

slope obtained by Esteban et al. (2005) is smoother than ours,
even though they performed the study of gradients based on
recombination lines instead of collisional lines. On the other
hand, our gradient is in good agreement with those performed
in a wider range of distances (0 to18 kpc) and, as can be seen in
Fig. 7, our slope agrees with Rudolph et al. (2006). Gradients
obtained by Deharveng et al. (2000), Quireza et al. (2006), and
Balser et al. (2011) are slightly shallower than ours, but are
consistent within errors. V´ılchez & Esteban (1996) are the only
authors who have focused their study on the outer part of the
Galaxy. They provide three diﬀerent oxygen gradients, and our
slope agrees with the one obtained from all of their data (third
option in Table 9), but not with the other ﬁts.

Figure 8 shows the radial distribution of the ﬁnal N/H abun-
dances. The derived nitrogen abundances present values between
12+log(N/H)=7.44 and 6.88 and their distribution shows a clear
decrease with distance. Observed values follow closely the per-
formed ﬁt, although those derived from radio temperatures (blue
squares) are slightly higher, but still in agreement within mea-
sured errors. The resulting ﬁts, for all the regions and for direct
abundances alone, are in agreement, taking the errors into ac-
count.

Within the uncertainties this result for the nitrogen gradient
is not diﬀerent from those found by Shaver et al. (1983),
Simpson et al. (1995), Rudolph et al. (1997), Aﬄerbach et al.
(1997), and Rudolph et al. (2006). However, our slope diﬀers
from that obtained by V´ılchez & Esteban (1996) for a similar
range of RG: we do not see any clear steepening of nitrogen in
the outer part of the Galaxy disc.

Figure 9 shows the behaviour of N/O versus Galactocentric
distance for the studied regions. The derived values of N/O
range from log(N/O)=-0.87 to -1.19. In this case almost no
diﬀerence exists between the slope derived from directly derived
abundances and the value considering also abundances derived
using model ﬁts, since the latter have much higher associated
errors and they thus have a lower weight in the ﬁt. Our slope
is consistent with the value obtained by Simpson et al. (1995)
from infrared observation in the inner parts of the Galaxy, but
diﬀers from Rudolph et al. (2006) who found that N/O is nearly
constant at all distances. The ﬁt of the data shown in Fig. 9
presents a decreasing slope in N/O with Galactocentric distance,
although a step function is also plausible (see next section).

The sulphur radial gradient is plotted in Fig. 10. The derived
sulfur abundances present values between 12+log(S/H)=7.01
and 6.37 along the range of Galactocentric distances, with the
exception of the high S/H value of S311 (which has the lowest
value of te([S iii])) and the low estimation of S/H in S98. The
distribution shows a negative radial gradient with a slope that
is much steeper than those derived by other authors. This may
be a consequence of the large weight of regions located at large
Galactic radius whose abundances have very low errors.

from
12+log(Ar/H)=6.4 to 5.9, decreasing clearly with distance. In
this case all the abundances represented were derived using the
direct method (direct measures of electron temperature for all
the regions) and we only show one ﬁt for the gradient in Table
8. This is the ﬁrst time that the distribution of argon towards
the Galactic anticentre is shown. Shaver et al. (1983) derived a
gradient of d(log(Ar/H))/dRG=-0.06±0.015 in the inner part of
the Galaxy, which is in good agreement with our slope, taking
the ﬁt uncertainties into account.

Finally, Fig. 12 shows the radial distribution of helium abun-
dances. The derived values of He/H cluster around He/H∼0.09

gradient and the least-squares ﬁt to the data gives a slope that

is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero. Trying to compare our
results with those of other authors, we ﬁnd that no attempts have
been made previously to estimate the total helium radial abun-
dance gradient of the Galaxy, only the distribution of He+/ H+
has been studied before with slopes also close to zero (Peimbert
et al. 1978; Talent & Dufour 1979; Shaver et al. 1983; Deharveng
et al. 2000).

4.3. Chemical composition of the outer Galaxy

The knowledge of the chemical distribution across the Galactic
disc is a benchmark for models of chemical evolution. For this
reason, considerable eﬀort has been made to establish the abun-
dance gradients in the MW by studying the distribution of many
elements and many sources which all probe diﬀerent epochs in
the MW chemical evolution history. Figure 13 provides com-
parisons of our O/H abundance gradient derived from the total
H ii region sample towards the anticentre with many other gradi-
ents derived from studies with PNe, cepheids, B-type stars, and
H ii regions in a wide range of Galactic distances (0-20 kpc). The
gradients adopted for the diﬀerent objects are shown in Table 10
and are those provided directly by the authors. Moreover, oxygen
abundances derived in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds
(Russell & Dopita 1990), Orion nebula (Tsamis et al. 2011), and
the Sun (Asplund et al. 2009) are also represented in Fig. 13.

Galactic disc for diﬀerent sources. Black circles represent all
the H ii regions studied in this work and the solid black line
indicates the gradient obtained with them. Gradients derived
from PNs (long dashed red line), H ii regions (dash-dotted blue
line), B-type stars (dash-dot-dotted pink line) and Cepheids
(short-dashed green line) are also represented. The Sun and the
Orion nebula (M42) are shown at their respective O/H abun-
dances located at RG =8.5 kpc and RG=8.95 kpc, respectively.
Horizontal arrows show chemical abundances of the Small and
Large Magellanic Clouds.

B-type stars are massive young stars (<10 Myr) and their
abundances trace the metallicity near their current location.
Rolleston et al. (2000) studied a sample of about 80 early B-type
main sequence stars located from 6 to 18 kpc. They conclude that
the distribution of oxygen can be represented by a linear gradient
with no evidence of a better ﬁtting with a two-zone model. As
we can see in Fig. 13 and Table 10, the results from Rolleston
et al. (2000) are the most diﬀerent to ours, with a much steeper
slope and the largest ordinate at origin.

Planetary nebulae trace metallicity in the Galactic disc,
bulge, and halo. Their ages span 1-8 Gyr and thus PNe can in
principle probe metallicity with time. We compare our results
with those obtained from Henry et al. (2010) who determined
chemical abundances of 124 PNe extending from 0.9 to 21 kpc
in Galactocentric distances. We ﬁnd an agreement in slope with
their gradient as we can see in Fig. 13 and Table 10. They found
some evidence that the gradient beyond 10 kpc is steeper than it
is inside this distance.

Cepheids are evolved stars that can be detected at large dis-
tances and are relatively young (<200Myrs), hence they are pri-
mary tracers of metals in the Galactic disc. We compare our
gradient with that obtained by the recent work of Korotin et
al. (2014) and ﬁnd a good agreement between the two slopes.
They also found some evidence that the distribution might be-
come ﬂatter in the outer parts of the disc.

Galactic H ii regions are the formation sites of massive
OB stars and they reveal the location of current Galactic star
formation. In Fig. 13 we also represent the gradient obtained by
Rudolph et al. (2006), considering it as a collection of previous
studies with H ii regions. Their results are consistent with ours,
taking the uncertainties into account.

What do we conclude from these studies? The existence of
those gradients oﬀers the opportunity to compare with models
of disc evolution to understand the formation and chemical
evolution of our Galaxy. All the results obtained from diﬀerent
sources present a negative radial gradient
(although with
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in their slopes), thus metal abundances in

the inner disc are higher than those in the outer disc. This result
supports the Inside-Out formation scheme of the disc (Hou et
al. 2000; Alib´es et al. 2001; Chiappini et al. 2003). The inner
part of the disc always forms ﬁrst, and the outer part forms
progressively later as gas with higher angular momentum settles
into the equatorial plane at larger radii, causing the disc to
grow outward with time. The metal abundance of the innermost
part of the disc is higher because of the prior enrichment of
the infalling gas before it reaches the equatorial plane, and the
metal abundances of the outermost part of the disc is smaller
because of the relatively long time scale for star formation and
metal enrichment. Therefore, the negative gradients obtained
in this work and results from other sources are consistent with
Inside-Out models; the diﬀerences in slopes can be explained by
the amount of material, yields, and star formation rates adopted
by the model (e.g. Moll´a et al. 2015).

As far as the shape of the gradient is concerned, the pos-
sibility of variations in the slope towards the outer disc is still
widely debated. Several works (not represented in Fig. 13 for
clarity) based on diﬀerent tracers (cepheids, open clusters, PNe,
and H ii regions) have found evidence that the radial abundance
gradient of some elements may ﬂatten out at the outer part of
the Galaxy disc (Fich & Silkey 1991; V´ılchez & Esteban 1996;

2004; Luck et al. 2006; Carraro et al. 2007; Pedicelli et al. 2009;
Henry et al. 2010; Andreuzzi et al. 2011; Korotin et al. 2014). In
addition, strong evidence for ﬂattening at large distances of discs
of other spiral galaxies has been presented in several papers (van
Zee et al. 1998; Goddard et al. 2011; Werk et al. 2011; Bresolin
et al. 2012).

Our sample is located towards the anticentre; in order to
analyse the radial behaviour of the abundance gradient in the
outermost disc, we need to make a comparison with literature
gradients performed in wider radial ranges including the inner
parts of the Galaxy. When doing so, our data suggest a shal-
lower slope. Although this result does not necessarily imply a
ﬂattening of the gradient in the outer disc, what is clear is that
the simple extrapolation of the inner slope towards the anticentre
is not consistent with the observations.

From the theoretical point of view, several chemical evo-
lution models have been computed to reproduce the ﬂattening
observed. However, authors suggest diﬀerent physical mech-
anisms to explain this behaviour: lower eﬀective yields in the
outer disc than in the inner disc (Twarog et al. 1997), eﬀective
suppression of mixing processes near the corotation circle
(Andrievsky et al. 2002; Luck et al. 2003; Andrievsky et al.
2004), constant density distribution of the halo stellar compo-
nent in the inner 20 kpc (Cescutti et al. 2007), levelling out of
the star formation eﬃciency about and beyond the isophotal
radius (Esteban et al. 2013), etc. More information about this
topic can be found in Bresolin et al. (2012), who discuss several

mechanisms that can be responsible for the ﬂattening in the
outermost disc of spiral galaxies.

The N/O abundance ratio is a useful indicator of the chemi-
cal age of the galaxy and how evolved the disc is. An interesting
feature suggested by Fig. 9 is that our N/O gradient seems to be
better represented by a step function instead of a linear ﬁt. We
compute a new double ﬁt using only those N/O abundances de-
rived from the direct method (Table 5) and diﬀerentiating those
regions placed within 12 kpc from the centre and farther than
this limit. The result for RG <12 kpc is

log(N/O) = - (0.7264 ± 1.3963) + (0.0152 ± 0.1240) RG,
while for RG >12kpc we obtain
log(N/O) = - (0.8993 ± 0.1689) + (0.0150 ± 0.0116) RG.
Figure 14 shows the radial distribution of direct N/O abun-
dances within the two ﬁts performed with data at RG <12 kpc
(blue dot-dashed line) and RG >12 kpc (red dashed line). As
can be seen, both data sets are represented by lines with similar
slopes (nearly constant) but diﬀerent origins as the N/O ratio is
uniform in two distance ranges. We conclude that the N/O distri-
bution with Galactic distance for the disc can be better described
by a step function rather than a linear gradient. Furthermore,
with this double ﬁt the statistical dispersion is obviously smaller
than with the single ﬁt.

From the point of view of chemical evolution, the origin
of nitrogen is still a matter of important debate because it can
have a primary or secondary origin. The overall picture of the
chemical composition of galaxies seems to indicate that there
are two main behaviours in the N/O versus O/H relationship de-
pending on metallicity: a ﬂat line with log(N/O)=-1.46 (Garnett
1990) for the data of low-mass and irregular galaxies with
12+log(O/H)<8.3, and a strong slope for the N/O data against
oxygen abundance for metal-rich regions. The ﬁrst case reﬂects
the proportion of the true primary production of nitrogen (inde-
pendent of oxygen abundance), which is believed to be synthe-
sised in massive stars. The second situation explains the exis-
tence of secondary nitrogen (proportional to oxygen abundance)
processed in the CNO burning during the stellar evolution and
returned into the ISM via PNe or stellar winds of massive stars
(e.g. Edmunds 1990, Moll´a et al. 2006).

In Fig. 15 we analyse the behaviour of nitrogen abundances

chemical evolution of the MW. The primary focus of this paper
was to give an accurate description of the radial chemical distri-
bution towards the Galactic anticentre up to a distance of 18 kpc.
We have carried out new optical spectroscopic observations
of nine H ii regions located towards the Galactic anticentre us-
ing the ISIS spectrograph at the WHT. To realise a more ex-
tensive study, the sample was increased by searching for optical
H ii regions at RG >11 kpc in the literature. The complete sam-
ple comprised 23 H ii regions extending in Galactocentric radius
from 11 kpc to 18 kpc.

For 13 regions of the sample we have derived accurate
electron densities from the [S ii]λλ6717,6731 line ratio and
electron temperatures te([O iii]), te([S iii]), te([N ii]), te([O ii]),
and te([S ii]). These physical parameters have been used to
determine direct total chemical abundances. We have also per-
formed tailor-made photoionisation models to derive chemical
abundances for those regions without direct estimations of
temperature. In addition, by comparing radio recombination
temperatures
temperatures from the literature and optical
relation
from this work, we have obtained the empirical
te([O iii])=(0.175±0.080)+(0.792±0.081)×t∗
e. This relation has
been applied to three regions without direct temperature to
obtain their physical parameters and abundances.

To study the radial gradients of metallicity across the outer-
most part of the MW, we have performed weighted least-squares
ﬁts to the distribution of the O/H, N/H, N/O, S/H, Ar/H, and
He/H abundances along the Galactocentric distances. We have
concluded the following:

1. The radial distribution of oxygen abundance is ﬁt well by
a regression whose form is 12+log(O/H)=(9.006±0.112)-
(0.053±0.009)RG, where RG is the Galactocentric radius in
kpc. When comparing our result with gradients performed
with several objects in wider radial ranges, including the in-
ner parts of the Galaxy, we ﬁnd a suggestion for a shallower
slope. Our data cannot be used to conﬁrm the ﬂattening of the
abundance gradient towards the outer disc suggested previ-
ously, but clearly show that a linear extrapolation of the inner
slope is inconsistent with the observations

2. The derived gradient for N/H abundances shows a clear de-
crease with distance with a slope of -0.080±0.019 dex kpc−1.
This result is in good agreement with previous works. We do
not see any steepening of nitrogen in the outer part of Galaxy
disc.

3. In the case of the N/O ratio, the radial distribution is bet-
ter described by a step function rather than a linear gradient.
The double-ﬁt performed shows diﬀerent behaviours for re-
gions located beyond 12 kpc than for those with RG <12 kpc,
but both with constant slopes. The radial behaviour in the
outer parts of the disc compared to the solar neighbourhood
can be understood if we are witnessing a special time in the
chemical evolution of the outer MW, which can be a result of
the increase in nitrogen abundance from intermediate-mass
stars.

4. The ﬁt obtained for the distribution of sulphur abundance is
12+log(S/H)=(8.162±0.088)-(0.106±0.006)RG. This gradi-
ent shows a slope that is much steeper than those derived by
other authors, probably reﬂecting the more accurate values
from our data at large Galactic distances.

5. The argon gradient has been derived for the ﬁrst time in
regions towards the Galactic anticentre with the functional
form 12+log(Ar/H)=(7.178±0.073)-(0.074±0.006)RG. This

dances for the regions located towards the anticentre studied in
this work. As can be seen, nitrogen follows oxygen and the N/O
ratio is constant with O/H, suggesting that nitrogen has a primary
origin. However, our data show that in this zone log(N/O)>-1.46,
which is indicative of a previous enrichment by evolved inter-
mediate mass stars (the secondary nitrogen component). In this
case, the fact that N/O is constant informs us that all regions
have a similar “chemical age”(understanding age in the sense of
the time since the bulk of its star formation occurred). The ob-
served N/O values and radial behaviour in the outer parts of the
disc compared to the solar neighbourhood can be understood if
we are witnessing a special time in the chemical evolution of the
outer MW; in the Edmunds & Pagel (1978) chemical age sce-
nario this can be a result of the increase in nitrogen abundance
from intermediate-mass stars. When comparing our nitrogen dis-
tribution with the abundances in the Magellanic Clouds, it can be
seen that our N/O ratio appears larger than the value for the SMC
and LMC, log(N/O)= -1.58 ± 0.16 and log(N/O)= -1.30 ± 0.30,
respectively (Russell & Dopita 1990), for a range in log(O/H)
comparable to the abundances measured in the outer disc; this is
in line with the chemical ageing scenario mentioned before for
the outer disc of the MW.

5. Summary and conclusions

The abundances of heavy elements in the ISM provide a fos-
sil record of the enrichment which has taken place due to the
nucleosynthesis in successive generation stars. The study of the
radial variations of metallicity across the Galactic disc is a pow-
erful method for understanding the history of star formation and
