Abstract/Executive summary 

The  DarkSide-50  experiment  demonstrated  the  ability  to  extract  and  purify  argon  from  deep 
underground sources and showed that the concentration of 39Ar in that argon was greatly reduced from 
the level found in argon derived from the atmosphere.  That discovery broadened the physics reach of 
argon-based  detector  and  created  a  demand  for  low-radioactivity  underground  argon  (UAr)  in  high-
energy physics, nuclear physics, and in environmental and allied sciences. The Global Argon Dark Matter 
Collaboration (GADMC) is preparing to produce UAr for DarkSide-20k, but a general UAr supply for the 
community  does  not  exist.  With  the  proper  resources,  those  plants  could  be  operated  as  a  facility  to 
supply UAr for most of the experiments after the DarkSide-20k production. However, if the current source 
becomes unavailable, or UAr masses greater than what is available from the current source is needed, 
then a new source must be found. To find a new source will require understanding the production of the 
radioactive argon isotopes underground in a gas field, and the ability to measure  37Ar,  39Ar, and  42Ar to 
ultra-low levels. The operation of a facility creates a need for ancillary systems to monitor for 37Ar, 39Ar, 
or 42Ar infiltration either directly or indirectly, which can also be used to vet the 37Ar, 39Ar, and 42Ar levels 
in a new UAr source, but requires the ability to separate UAr from the matrix well gas. Finding methods 
to work with industry to find gas streams enriched in UAr, or to commercialize a UAr facility, are highly 
desirable.

Introduction 

Argon derived from the atmosphere, which is predominately stable 40Ar [1], contains cosmogenically 
produced long-lived radioactive isotopes of argon—  42Ar,  39Ar, and  37Ar  [2]. These  isotopes are  at high 
enough concentrations in the atmosphere to be a significant background for low-background argon-based 
radiation detectors, and because all commercial argon is produced from air, these argon radionuclides 
can  represent  irreducible  backgrounds.  However,  after  a  5-year  campaign  of  extracting  and  purifying 
argon from deep CO2 wells in Southwestern Colorado in the United States, the DarkSide-50 dark matter 
search experiment demonstrated that this unique argon contained an 39Ar concentration 0.073% of that 
in the atmosphere, or approximately 0.73 mBq/kgAr [3]. Cosmogenically produced 37Ar was also detected 
in the early running of the DarkSide-50 detector [3], but 42Ar was not observed. This demonstrated that 
large-mass quantities of low-radioactivity underground argon can be obtained and has sparked a global 
interest in a sustained supply of low-radioactivity underground argon to meet the needs of a broad range 
of disciplines, from nuclear and particle physics to environmental studies and national security.  

The  broader  availability of  low-radioactivity  argon  and  the  challenges  associated  with  finding  new 
sources,  the  current  and  future  production  of  underground  argon,  and  the  characterization  of 
underground  argon  have  become  important  topics associated  with  the  growing  need.  As  an  example, 
measuring the concentration of  39Ar in underground argon is critical to both searching for new sources 
and as quality assurance and quality control during production. Additionally, the determination of argon 
radionuclide production underground and in the atmosphere is relevant to both new underground argon 
source characterization and in understanding cosmogenic activation when the underground argon resides 
close to, or on the surface of, the Earth. Both issues are also relevant in the context of groundwater dating 
using  39Ar. Additionally, isotope separation may be required to achieve the level of argon-radioisotope 
depletion needed for some applications. 

The need for low-radioactivity underground argon (UAr) 

The largest needs for low-radioactivity underground argon are in the fundamental nuclear and particle 
physics  fields.  The  DarkSide  experiments  have  been  driving  the  demand  and  production  for  low-
radioactivity underground argon [3], but with that success the demands for UAr have risen. Beyond WIMP 
dark  matter  detection,  the  physics  that  is  more  easily  reached  by  the  availability  of  low-radioactivity 
underground argon includes: neutrinoless double-beta decay, by eliminating  42Ar and  39Ar in the argon 
that surrounds the germanium crystals of the LEGEND experiment; measuring low-energy neutrinos in a 
DUNE-like detector, by reducing the 39Ar beta rate and also the higher-energy beta from 42K (the daughter 
of 42Ar); and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering within the series of COHERENT experiments, by 
increasing live-time by reducing 39Ar decays. 

The  potential  needs  for  low-radioactivity  underground  argon  span  from  tens  of  kilograms  for  the 
COHERENT experiment to tens of kilotonnes for a DUNE-like module to a long-term, enduring supply for 
low-level radiation detection for environmental science (10-100 kg annually). Likewise, the requirements 
for 39Ar reduction from the atmospheric concentration span several orders of magnitude, from a factor of 
10 reduction for COHERENT to more than a factor of 1000 for future argon-based dark matter searches. 
The specific needs for low-radioactivity underground argon are reviewed for five distinct uses. 

The Global Argon Dark Matter Collaboration  

DarkSide-20k is a 20-tonne fiducial volume dual-phase TPC to be operated at LNGS with 100 tonnes 
of  underground  argon  (UAr),  designed  to  collect  an  exposure  of  100  tonne×years,  completely  free  of 
neutron-induced  nuclear  recoil  backgrounds  and  all  electron  recoil  backgrounds  [4].  DarkSide-20k  will 
have sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross sections of 1.2×10−47cm2 for WIMPs of 1 TeV/c2

mass following a 5-year run. An extended 10-year run could produce an exposure of 200 tonne×years, 
with sensitivity to a cross section of 7.4 × 10−48 cm2, for the same WIMP mass. DarkSide-20k will explore 
the  WIMP-nucleon  cross-section  down  to  the  edge  of  the  “neutrino  floor,”  where  coherent  neutrino-
nucleus scattering from environmental neutrinos induce nuclear recoils in the detector. At the same time, 
the Global Argon Dark Matter Collaboration (GADMC) will pursue the search for low-mass WIMPs with a 
1-tonne  detector,  DarkSide-LowMass,  which  also  takes  aim  at  the  “neutrino  floor”  for  masses  below 
8 GeV/c2.  The level of 39Ar depletion directly impacts the sensitivity of DarkSide-LowMass, therefore it is 
planned to be run with UAr processed for further reduction of  39Ar with the Aria plant in Sardinia, the 
tallest cryogenic distillation plant ever constructed [5]. 

Plans  are  being  developed  within  the  GADMC  for  an  experiment  beyond DarkSide-20k  for  further 
WIMP  reach,  Argo.  Argo  will  be  a multi-hundred  tonne  detector that  will  approach the  neutrino  floor 
following a 1,000 tonne-year exposure. The Argo will require upwards of 500 tonnes of low-radioactivity 
underground argon [6].  

COHERENT NEUTRINO SCATTERING 

Liquid argon experiments searching for low-energy beam-related processes, such as coherent elastic 
neutrino nucleus scattering (CEvNS) [7, 8] and the production of dark matter particles in a proton beam 
[9] could benefit from the reduction of 39Ar provided with the use of UAr. Specific examples are the liquid 
argon detectors employed by COHERENT at the ORNL SNS [10] and by Coherent Captain-Mills (CCM) at 
the  LANL  Lujan  center  [11,  12].  In  both  of  these  scintillation-only  detectors,  both  electron/gamma 
identification and the use of a pulsed beam greatly reduces the 39Ar background, but it is still the dominant 
steady-state  background  [13].  The  use  of  UAr  with  a  39Ar  suppression  factor  of  O(x100-x1000)  would 
substantially improve the statistical precision of the resulting measurements [14]. 

DUNE-LIKE DETECTOR 

A multi-kiloton liquid argon time projection chamber would have unique sensitivity to the electron 
neutrino  component  of  a  core-collapse  supernova  burst,  via  the  dominant  charged-current  (CC) 
interaction νe+40Ar → e− +40K∗ [15]. The dominant radiological background is 39Ar, the presence of which 
degrades event reconstruction quality and presents a challenge for DAQ and trigger design. For example, 
even though argon allows to perform e-/γ background removal via pulse shape discrimination (PSD), for a 
WIMP  dark matter search,  a  few  kilo-tonnes  argon  volume  will  create  a  pile-up  problem,  without  the 
required  low  level  of  39Ar  suppression  that  UAr  provides.  The  background  is  furthermore  a  serious 
impediment to potential detection of the “CEvNS glow” of a supernova burst [16] and will impede other 
ambitious attempts to extract information from very low energy physics signals [17].  Obtaining quantities 
of UAr sufficient to fill a DUNE-like detector will be challenging, but there have been positive discussions 
with commercial underground gas producers indicating that on the scale of 10s of kilo-tonnes, UAr might 
be produced in an acceptable time scale (approx. 5 years) at a roughly estimated cost of only three times 
commercial argon. 

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSAY 

Radiometric  age  dating  using  39Ar  covers  an  intermediate  age  range  not  achievable  with  other 
naturally occurring radioisotopes [18] and is used in fields such as ground water age dating to understand 
the recharge rate of the California Central Valley Aquifer system [19], ocean ventilation [20], and others. 
A handful of groups around the globe have developed technologies for measuring trace amounts of 39Ar 
[19, 21, 22, 23]. These technologies will benefit greatly from a supply of argon free of 39Ar for detection 
limit determination and to avoid the introduction of modern argon (which is 39Ar rich) into the detection 
systems.

It has been estimated that access to 100 kg/year for many years (i.e., decades) would satisfy both 
current  and  expanding  needs  in  this  area.  Although  this  could  be  met  by  stockpiling  from  the  UAr 
production  for  fundamental  physics  experiments,  a  truly  enduring  supply  would  be  beneficial  as 
underground storage becomes necessary for the long-term, and institutional knowledge about how the 
stockpile was obtained may be lost over time. It is not likely that an  39Ar concentration better than that 
attained in the DarkSide-50 experiment would be required.  

LEGEND 

The  Large  Enriched  Germanium  Experiment  for  Neutrinoless  double  beta  Decay  (LEGEND1000)  is 
proposed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) of 76Ge. The experiment will probe the 0νββ 
decay of 76Ge with a 3σ discovery potential of a half-life > 1028 yr corresponding to a limit on the effective 
neutrino mass of < 17 meV. The Ge detectors will be distributed among four 250-kg modules to allow 
commissioning of the array in stages and independent operation. In each module, the detector strings are 
immersed within a liquid argon active shield, sourced from radiopure UAr. It is expected that 42Ar will be 
greatly reduced within underground Ar, as is the case for 39Ar. Hence, this UAr will provide direct reduction 
of background from the decay of 42K, a daughter of 42Ar decay.  

Current UAr production and future facility 

The  current  large-scale  production  of  UAr  is  being  pursued  by  the  Global  Argon  Dak  Matter 
Collaboration (GADMC) focused on production for the DarkSide-20k detector. To create UAr of sufficient 
quality for the DarkSide-20k experiment, argon is first extracted from CO2 in southwestern Colorado that 
is  used  for  enhanced  oil  recovery  [24].  The  crude  UAr  is  then  shipped  to  Sardinia  where  it  is  purified 
through cryogenic distillation. The plants that are used for this UAr production currently fall under the 
purview of the GADMC, but when the UAr for DarkSide-20k has been obtained, then those plants could 
become part of a UAr facility to provide UAr for a number of needs; the primary needs being those listed 
above. 

Urania is the plant that will be located outside of Cortez, Colorado to produce the crude UAr. It will 
accept CO2 with 400 ppm of UAr and will produce 99.9% pure UAr at a rate of 330 kg/day. The plant is 
largely based on cryogenic distillation, where a distillation column is used to remove bulk CO2 and then a 
pressure  swing  adsorption  unit  is  used  to  fully  remove  all  CO2.  Then  the  gas  passes  through  2  more 
distillation columns, first to remove methane and then to remove nitrogen. The plant will be installed in 
CY23 with full operations in CY24 and the final UAr extracted for DarkSide-20k in mid CY25. [4] 

Aria is a 350 m tall cryogenic distillation column, the tallest distillation column in the world, capable 
of isotopic enrichment [25]. The small difference in the vapor pressure of argon isotopes [26] allow for 
the separation of argon isotopes by distillation. Operating in a mine shaft on the island of Sardinia in Italy, 
Aria will be able to further reduce the concentration of  39Ar by a factor of 10 per pass and at a rate of 
several  kg/day.  Beyond  argon  isotopic  enrichment,  the  column  has  commercial  applications  in  the 
production of isotopes for nuclear energy and medicine. For DarkSide-20k, however, Aria will not be used 
to  reduce  39Ar,  but  rather  to  chemically  purify  the  crude  UAr  from  Urania  (99.9%  pure)  to  produce 
detector-grade UAr. For this chemical purification Aria will produce on the order of 1000 kg/day of purified 
UAr. 

Quality Control and Quality Assurance 

For any source of UAr, it is crucial to eliminate, or to minimize to acceptable levels, the infiltration or 
creation of  37Ar,  39Ar, and/or  42Ar (radioargon) in the UAr during production and storage, either due to 
poisoning the UAr with atmospheric argon or the production of radioargon by cosmic rays. The allowable 
radioargon content is experiment specific, and a general use UAr productoin facility should be designed 

4

to meet the most stringent experimental requirement, albeit with a lower limit imposed by the intrinsic 
purity of the crude UAr containing gas. Once the UAr has reached the surface of the earth, cosmogenic 
activation becomes the dominant production mechanism for radioargon. The level of effort required to 
transport and shield the UAr from cosmic rays will be driven by the particular use case. 

Direct radioargon level monitoring 

The levels of radioargon in the UAr and  levels required by experiments  are  far lower than  what  is 
detectable in most readily available assay capabilities. Within the age-dating communities, there are 2 
radiometric laboratories in the  world that measure  39Ar and  37Ar  using gas proportional counting,  The 
University of Bern in Switzerland and Pacific Northwest National in the United States [27, 19]. An emerging 
technology is the use of atom trap trace analysis, which has been demonstrated in measuring  39Ar for 
understanding ocean ventilation [20]. These technologies are able to reach 39Ar levels at approximately 
5%  of  the  atmospheric  concentration,  or  about  50  mBq/kg,  which  is  only  sufficient  if  there  is  a  gross 
infiltration of atmospheric argon into the UAr process stream. However, the sample sizes are from 10cc 
to 1 liter of argon at STP and may be of benefit for rapid sampling. A dedicated detector for measuring 
ultra-low levels of 39Ar in argon, DART, has been built within the former ARDM detector [28]. DART is a 
small (∼1 L) chamber that will measure the depletion factor of 39Ar in UAr to levels a factor of 1000 below 
the atmospheric concentration (~1mBq/kg). The sample size required for DART is about 2.2 kg [28]. The 
radiometric technologies can also be used for 37Ar, but, although it has been measured in the atmosphere, 
there is no method for routine assay of argon for 42Ar. 

Each of these 39Ar assay technologies are fixed laboratory capabilities and require time for analysis. 
Therefore,  their  utility  in monitoring  39Ar  levels  in  UAr  production  are  limited to  a  batch  mode  check, 
where UAr samples are taken at the production plant and sent to the facility. This calls into question the 
method of transportation and if it is permissible to expose the UAr to greater cosmic ray flux in flight to 
an assay facility, or if it must remain on the ground/sea, which will increase sample travel time. Assay 
systems  may  be  required  to  be  at  least  within  the  same  continent  as  the  UAr  production  facility  to 
minimize cosmic ray exposure. 

Indirect radioargon monitoring  

An indirect method for monitoring radioargon contamination in the UAr is to search for air infiltration 
during  production.  The  0.934%  argon  concentration  in  atmospheric  argon  makes  monitoring  for  air 
infiltration increasingly difficult with lower UAr concentrations in the crude gas. The concentration of UAr 
in the CO2 stream that the DarkSide-50 UAr was derived from has a concentration of about 400 ppm [29]. 
At  this  level,  the  amount  of  39Ar  found  in  the  DarkSide-50  UAr  would  be  equivalent  to  approximately 
30 ppm of  air  in  the  CO2  stream.  When the  well  gas  also  contains  air  constituents  (e.g.  nitrogen), the 
monitoring of air infiltration is further complicated. If oxygen is used as a tracer for air infiltration, then to 
measure 30 ppm of air requires a 6 ppm sensitivity to oxygen, but sensitivities as low as 1 ppb may be 
needed for well gas with low concentrations of UAr and/or driven by experimental requirements. If the 
well  gas  contains  nitrogen  and  oxygen,  then  other  air  constituents  might  be  used,  which  will  require 
instrumentation with even greater  sensitivities  to those  gases.  This mode of monitoring is UAr source 
specific, because it depends on the constituents of the crude UAr containing well gas. 

An alternate  solution  that has been developed  is to use  the ratio of stable  argon isotopes  [30]. In 
underground argon the abundance of 36Ar and 38Ar are lower than in argon derived from the atmosphere 
[31]. Therefore, the 36Ar:40Ar ratio can be used to monitor the final UAr product for any air infiltration in 
the entire UAr production process [30]. This mode of monitoring will depend on the how sensitively the 
ratio must be monitored to detect an air infiltration of concern.

A facility beyond Urania/Aria 

For UAr needs that are beyond the means of Urania and Aria, whether that be because quantities of 
UAr are needed beyond what the Urania plant can provide or that Urania/Aria have reached their end of 
life, a new source will need to be found. For very large-scale production, for example what may be needed 
for a DUNE-like experiment, to make UAr production the most cost efficient would require finding sources 
that  either  have  high  argon  concentrations,  or  where  the  UAr  is  chemically  enriched  to  higher 
concentrations. For example, helium is a gas that is extracted and purified from natural underground gases 
[32]. If that underground gas also contains UAr, then it is highly likely that there is a process stream with 
enriched UAr. At PNNL, discussions with major gas producers have identified exactly such a stream, where 
there is enriched UAr and would be easier to process than directly from the crude underground gas. The 
commercial producer has estimated that for a 10+ kilo-tonne-scale production the UAr may cost a factor 
three more than regular commercially available argon. Such a future UAr facility may simply become a 
parasitic operation to the major underground gas production. Ideally, UAr production would be carried 
out by a commercial producer, for which the Urania plant might still be used in whole or in part to produce 
UAr from the new enriched source.  

To find a new  source, the level of  radioargon  underground  needs to be  predicted.  Estimating  39Ar 
production in underground minerals has been carried out [33], but how it enters a gas field needs to be 
understood. The radioargon levels will need to be verified and the detection systems that are used for 
QA/QC  can  be  used  for  a  new  UAr  source  characterization,  but  methods  for  separating  UAr  from  the 
matrix it is found in are needed. This becomes more challenging the more UAr that is needed (~2kg for 
DART). Systems exist for separating argon from air [34], but new systems will be needed the more the 
matrix deviates from air (e.g., CO2 wells). 

Conclusion 

The work of the Darkside collaboration to develop a source of UAr with Urania/Aria has the potential 
to  benefit  a  host  of  other  low-background  experiments  with  modest  incremental  investment.      With 
sufficient resources, operating the Urania and Aria infrastructure beyond the production period required 
for  DarkSide-20k  could  meet  the  UAr  demand  for  most  of  the  foreseen  future  experimental  needs. 
However, if the UAr source in southwestern Colorado becomes unusable in the future, then a new source 
would need to be found and Urania may be incorporated into that new facility. For the production of very 
large masses of UAr, e.g., for a DUNE-like detector, it is envisioned that a commercial source would be 
required, where UAr is found enriched in part of the process stream for other gas separations. For this 
effort  to  be  successful,  an  array  of  ancillary  facilities  and  technologies  must  be  developed,  primarily 
focused around quality control and assurance, and these technologies may be used to search for new UAr 
sources.
