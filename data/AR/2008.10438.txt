Abstract:  In  this  paper,  a  position  and  velocity  estimation 
method for robotic manipulators which are affected by constant 
bounded  disturbances  is  considered.  The  tracking  control 
problem is formulated as a disturbance rejection problem, with 
all  the  unknown  parameters  and  dynamic  uncertainties  lumped 
into  disturbance.  Using  adaptive  robust  extended  Kalman 
filter(AREKF)    the  movement  and  velocity  of  each  joint  is 
predicted  to  use  in  discontinuous  Lyapunov-based  controller 
structure.  The  parameters  of  the  error  dynamics  have  been 
validated off-line by real data.  
Computer simulation results given for a two degree of freedom 
manipulator  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  the  improved  Kalman 
Filter  by  comparing  the  performance  of  EKF  and  improved  
AREKF. Although it is shown that accurate trajectory tracking 
can be achieved by using the proposed controller.

Introduction 

The tracking control of robotic manipulators has been 
extensively  studied in  recent years.  The design of   high-
performance robotic control systems, involving nonlinear 
control  algorithms  for  robotic  mechanisms  is  of  much 
interest[1].  Various  Controllers  are  designed 
for 
manipulators  that  are  subjected  to  disturbances  and 
parametric  uncertainties  [2].  In  [3]  a   novel  robust 
robot  
is 
passive control approach 
manipulator with  model  uncertainties  to  interact  with  its 
dynamic 
the robot's 
mechanic  energy. An  adaptive  position/force  controller 
has  been  used  for  robotic  manipulator  to  compensate 
parametric  uncertainties  while  only

measurements of the position and velocity of robot arms,

robotic manipulator with 

points[4].Neural  networks  and  fuzzy  controllers  have 
been  used 
tracking  errors  of 
manipulators[5, 6]. Sliding Mode control approach based 
on  neural  network  is  considered  in  [7]  where  the  model 
parameters  are  used  in  the  equivalent control law.  The 
inertia  matrix,  the  parameters  of  the  matrix  of  the 
Coriolis/centripetal  terms  and  the  gravity  vector  are 
estimated in this method. 
There  are  several  inherent  difficulties  associated  with 
internal  and  external  disturbances.  In  [8]  an  adaptive 
control of 
a  parameter 
robotic manipulator and 
estimation  method  are  discussed.  It  considers  a  five-bar 
linkage manipulator with  unknown  external  disturbance. 
A  novel  entropy based  indirect  iterative  learning  control 
methodology 
random 
disturbance is  sated  in  [9]  by  combining  the  minimum 
error  entropy  and  the  optimal  strategy,  which  is  used  to 
update  local  controller  parameters  between  any  two 
adjacent  batches.    In  [10]  disturbance observers  (DOB) 
are  used  to  reject  both  external disturbances as  well  as 
inherent internal uncertainties. As manipulator have to be 
robust against internal and external variations in the work 
place  the disturbance observer  has  to  estimate  unknown 
states and rejecting decoupled terms between links[11]. 
In  this  paper  discontinuous  Lyapunov-based  method  is 
time  variant 
evaluated 
disturbances. All system uncertainties are lumped into the 
disturbance term. 
Kalman filters have  been  used  in  robotics  literature  to 
estimate  the  joint  angles[12,  13].  The  main  idea  behind 
the  EKF  is  to  linearize  the  model  before  implementing 
the  Kalman  filter.    For  linearization  purpose,  it  is 
common  to  use  Taylor  expansions.  The  system  can  be 
extended  to  any  orders,  but  to  save  the  computing

resources  and  also  to  make  the  calculation  as  simple  as 
possible,  usually  only  first  (Jacobian)  order  of  Taylor 
expansion 
is  used.  The  kalman  filter  formulation 
completely depends on a priori knowledge of the system 
dynamics  and  it  is  also  assumed  that  the  process  and 
measurement  noise  covariance  matrices  are  pure  white, 
zero-mean,  completely  uncorrelated  and  completely 
known. If any of these assumptions were violated in any 
way,  as  they  always  were  in  real  implementations,  the 
filter  performance  will  go  bad  and  in  some  cases  may 
even go divergent. So it can be expected that an adaptive 
robust  extended  kalman

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2 
the  preliminaries  of  the  problem  are  established.  In 
section  3  designing  kalman  filter  is  formulated  into  a 
proper  disturbance 
rejection  problem.  Discontinous 
Lyapunov based controller is proposed in section 4. As an 
application  example,  a

presented, and finally the conclusion is given in section 6.

Designing Kalman Filters 

3.1 

Extended Kalman Filter 

The  most  vital  requirement  of  the  Kalman  filter  is  the 
linearity  of  the  system.  However,  in  real  world,  finding 
linear systems are quite hard and most of the systems that 
are being dialed with are highly nonlinear, so the Kalman 
filter should be outstretched that it could handle nonlinear 
systems  too.  One  of  the  methods  that  are  being  used  to 
overcome 
linearization 
is 
procedure. The resulting filter is referred as the extended 
Kalman filter (EKF).

equations of motion of the robot are complex and highly

that are convenient for controller design. These properties 
are as follows.

The ‘sign’ function is a discontinuous function and its 
value 
in  zero  can  cause  problem  by  stimulating 
unmodeled high order dynamics of system. To solve this 
problem, a saturation function is used instead of ‘sign’ in 
control laws.

Conclusion 

Adaptive  robust  extended  kalman  filter  based  on 
discontinuous  Lyapunov-based  controller  is  presented  in 
this paper to improve the accuracy of tracking procedure 
for robotic manipulators with time variant disturbances. 

The  results  of  application  of  the  AREKF  for  two 

degree of freedom manipulator are enough encouraging. 
In  this  case,  the  Extended  Kalman  Filter  can  quickly 
converge  and  avoid  trapped  in  local  minimum  of  the 
function. 
is  formulated  as  a 
The 
disturbance  rejection  problem,  with  all  the  system 
nonlinearities  and  uncertainties  lumped  into  disturbance.
