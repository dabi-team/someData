The molecular anion C

−
2 is currently of interest as a candidate for laser cooling due to its electronic
structure and favourable branching ratios to the ground electronic and vibrational state. Helium has
been proposed as a buﬀer gas to cool the molecule’s internal motion. We calculate the cross sections
−
2 with He, and also with Ne and
and corresponding rates for ro-vibrational inelastic collisions of C
Ar, on new 3D ab initio potential energy surfaces using quantum scattering theory. The rates for
vibrational quenching with He and Ne are very small and are similar to those for small neutral
molecules in collision with helium. The quenching rates for Ar however are far larger than those
with the other noble gases, suggesting that this may be a more suitable gas for driving vibrational
quenching in traps. The implications of these new results for laser cooling of C

−
2 are discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Laser cooling of molecules has become a very active
research area [1]. With the direct preparation of ultra-
cold molecular ensembles in magneto-optical traps [2]
numerous experiments on molecular quantum control,
novel quantum phases [3], precision spectroscopy [4], or
ultracold chemistry [5] become accessible. For atoms,
laser cooling of neutral and charged species has devel-
oped hand in hand. For molecules, however, no charged
molecular species has yet been successfully laser cooled.
Ions with bound excited electronic states that lie below
the ﬁrst fragmentation threshold and can be excited with
suitable narrow-band lasers are rare. Furthermore, a near
optimal Franck-Condon overlap of the vibrational wave-
functions is required to make closed optical cycles feasi-
ble.

The diatomic carbon molecular anion has been identi-
ﬁed as an interesting exception [6], as it possesses several
bound excited electronic states below the photodetach-
ment threshold. Furthermore, the electronic states A2Πu
and B2Σ+
u (Fig. 1) have high Franck-Condon overlap
factors with the X 2Σ+
g ground state for the transitions
between their lowest vibrational levels ν′ = 0 → ν′′ = 0
[7, 8]. Simulations of laser cooling using the B2Σ+
u [6]
−
and A2Πu [9] states have both shown that C
2 can, in
principle, be cooled eﬃciently to milikelvin temperatures

∗ francesco.gianturco@uibk.ac.at

using Doppler or Sisyphus cooling in Paul or Penning
traps. Photodetachment cooling has also been shown to
allow even lower temperatures to be accessed [10]. If laser
−
cooling of C
2 anions were to be realised, it would open
up the possibility of sympathetically cooling other anions
[9] or even antiprotons [10]. This last achievement could
allow the eﬃcient production of antihydrogen atoms, cur-
rently being investigated for tests of fundamental physics
such as CPT invariance [11] and the weak equivalence
principle [12].

The diatomic carbon molecular anion C

−
2 has been a
model system for decades, attracting a great deal of ex-
perimental [13–27] and theoretical [8, 28–36] work. Its
bound electronically excited states [32] are unusual for
an anion, which is a consequence of the high electron
aﬃnity of neutral C2 of around 3.3 eV [17, 21] in com-
bination with the open shell character of the electronic
conﬁguration of carbon dimers. In its ground electronic
state X 2Σ+
g the molecule has only evenly numbered ro-
−
tational states due to the nuclear statistics of the 12C
2
molecule with zero spin nuclei, while in the excited B2Σ+
u
state only odd-numbered rotational states exist.

It has also been suggested that C

−
2 could be present in
astronomical environments as neutral C2 is abundant in
interstellar space [37], comet tails [38] and is a common
component of carbon stars [39, 40]. The large EA of C2
−
and strong electronic absorption bands of C
2 [16] sug-
gest that the anion could also be detected in space [41]
but as yet no conclusive evidence of its presence has been
−
found [42–44]. As the most abundant isotopologue 12C
2
is a homonuclear diatomic molecule, it does not exhibit

 
 
 
 
 
 
Laser cooling of C

a pure ro-vibrational spectrum making its detection in
emission diﬃcult. Transitions to and from low lying ex-
cited electronic states could however allow for the anions
detection or, as will be evaluated and discussed here, as
a possible option, for the detection of the 12C13C− iso-
topologue which would then have a small dipole moment.
−
2 would ideally start with ions ini-
tially cooled to around 10 K, for example by helium
buﬀer gas cooling in a cryogenic ion trap [45, 46]. Pro-
−
cesses used to generate C
2 involve applying an electric
discharge to a mixture of C2H2 and CO2 in a carrier
gas [25, 47] which may form the anion in excited vibra-
tional states. Besides cooling the translational motion,
the buﬀer gas is then also required to cool internal de-
grees of freedom via inelastic collisions. Furthermore,
buﬀer gas may be a useful tool to quench excited vi-
brational levels when they get populated during laser
cooling due to the non-diagonal Franck-Condon factors.
This could circumvent the need for additional repumping
lasers. In a similar scheme, rotational buﬀer gas cooling
was performed during sympathetic translational cooling
of MgH+ [48].

In a recent paper we calculated cross sections and rate
−
coeﬃcients for C
2 -He rotationally inelastic collisions,
treating the anion as a rigid rotor [49]. The rates for
rotational excitation and quenching were found to be in
line with those for similar ionic molecules interacting with
helium [46]. Simulations of cooling rotational motion at
typical helium pressures in ion traps showed thermalisa-
tion to Boltzmann populations occurred within tenths of
seconds. Very recently we have extended this work and
−
also modelled the rotational cooling of C
2 with neon and
−
argon [50]. It was found that thermalization times of C
2
with He and Ne were fairly similar but cooling was sig-
niﬁcantly faster with Ar. This is due to the increased
−
interaction strength between C
2 and the larger atoms
which increased as expected in the series He < Ne < Ar.

In this work we present results for the quenching of
g elec-
internal vibrational motion of C
tronic state in collisions with the noble gas atoms helium,
neon and argon. A simpliﬁed view of the relevant vibra-
tional levels involved in these processes is shown speciﬁ-
cally in Figure 1. We know, however, that no quantitative
rate coeﬃcients for vibrational relaxation are available
−
2 has no oscillating dipole, the vibrational
to date. As C
levels are long lived with the ground electronic state’s
v = 2 levels persisting for over ﬁve seconds [24] and so
collisions are the only viable means of quenching these
−
2 vibrational
states eﬃciently. The rate coeﬃcients of C
quenching with helium may also prove useful in future
astronomical studies, should the anion be detected in an
interstellar environment where excited vibrational states
are important for observation, as in the circumstellar en-
velope around carbon rich stars where helium atoms are
also abundant.

The paper is organised as follows. In the next section
we discuss the potential energy curve (PEC) and vibra-
−
tional levels of the isolated C
2 in its ground electronic
2Σ+
g state. We further calculate the dipole moment of the
12C13C− isotopologue and discuss its value. In Section
III we provide details of ab initio calculations for the 3D
potential energy surfaces (PES) and ﬁtting of the surfaces
to a functional form. This section also contains details
of the vibrationally averaged matrix elements required
for scattering calculations. Details of the close-coupled
scattering calculations are given in Section IV. Cross
sections and corresponding rates for rotationally and vi-
brationally inelastic collisions are presented in Section V.
We present conclusions in Section VI.

As recently discussed by Gulania et al. [36], the elec-
tronic structure of the C2 molecule is notoriously diﬃcult
to calculate accurately due to many low-lying electronic
states giving rise to a multireference character of the ab
initio description of its ground electronic state. For the
−
C
2 anion considered here, the situation is not so severe
but the presence of a close-lying A2Πu state (4000 cm−1
above the ground 2Σ+
g state, see Fig. 1) still makes elec-
tronic structure calculations challenging.

The PEC of C

g state was calculated
from the 3D potential energy surfaces (see next section)
with the noble gas atom at R = 25 ˚A. The LEVEL pro-
gram [52] was used to obtain the vibrational energies and
−
2 molecule. Ab initio PEC points
wavefunctions for the C
were used as input, interpolated using a cubic spline and
extrapolated to r values below and above our range using
functions implemented in LEVEL. The relative energies
of the ﬁrst three vibrational levels along with the rota-
tional constants for each state are shown in Table I and
compared with previously published calculated theoret-
ical and experiment values. Table I also compares the

used for C
2 -Ne/Ar (see next section). While we do not
achieve spectroscopic accuracy with our PEC, the rela-
tive energy spacings are suﬃciently realistic for comput-
ing the vibrational quenching rates of interest here at a
reliable level. The results obtained for CCSD-T are closer
in agreement to experiment than those for the MCSCF
method but the diﬀerences will have a minimal impact
on the computed inelastic rate coeﬃcients obtained from
our scattering calculations of interest here. The PEC
ﬁt using LEVEL to the CCSD-T calculations and vibra-
tional wavefunctions for ν = 1, 2 and 3 are provided in
the Supplementary Material [53].

As discussed above, the C2 molecule has been detected
in various astronomical settings [37–40] but searches for
−
2 anion focusing on electronic transitions have so
the C
far not been conclusive [42–44]. Franck-Condon factors
and Einstein A coeﬃcients for these transitions have been
calculated by Shi et al.
[8]. Another possible detection
method, at least in principle, is the rotational transi-
tions of the 13C12C− isotopologue [34]. The rotational
constants for this isotoplogue were accurately calculated
by ˘Sedivcov´a and ˘Spirko [34]. Here we use our PEC to
assess the dipole moment of 13C12C− and Einstein A co-
eﬃcients for rotational transitions.

The dipole moment of a charged homonuclear diatomic
with diﬀerent isotopes arises due to the diﬀerence in the
centre of mass and centre of charge. An expression for
the dipole moment of HD+ was derived by Bunker [54]
and Ellison [55] as

′

µ(ν

, ν) = −[(ma − mb)/2mT ]ehν

′

|r|νi

(1)

where ma and mb are the masses of each nucleus and
mT = ma + mb. Using LEVEL the matrix element of the
vibrational coordinate r for 13C12C− for the ν′ = ν = 0
ground vibrational state was calculated as 1.27 ˚A, close to

3

−
2 of req = 1.2689 ˚A[8]. Us-
the equilibrium geometry of C
ing the masses for 13C12C− in Eq. 1 gives µ(0, 0) = 0.12
D. This compares to 0.87 D in HD+ [54]. For pure rota-
tional transitions the Einstein coeﬃcient for spontaneous
dipole transitions is given as [46]

where ωi→k ≈ 2B0(ji + 1) is the transition’s angular fre-
quency. In Table II the Einstein A coeﬃcients computed
using Eq. 2 for 12C13C− (treated as pseudo-singlet),
HD+ and C2H− are compared for the ﬁrst few rotational
levels. The Einstein A coeﬃcients for 12C13C− are orders
of magnitude smaller than for HD+ and C2H− and other
molecular ions [46]. The combination of very small rota-
tional emission coeﬃcients coupled with the isotope ratio
−
for 13C/12C of 0.01 suggests that detecting C
2 via the
rotational transitions of the 12C13C− isotopologue would
be very diﬃcult.

The interaction energies between C

electronic state with He, Ne and Ar atoms were calcu-
lated using ab initio methods implemented in the MOL-
PRO suite of codes [59, 60]. Geometries were deﬁned on a
Jacobi grid with R (the distance from the centre of mass
−
2 to the atom) ranging from 2.6 to 25 ˚A and θ (the
of C
−
2 internuclear axis r) from
angle between R and the C
0 to 90◦ in 10◦ intervals. Five values of the C-C bond
length for each system between r = 1.10-1.35 ˚A were used
including the equilibrium value of req = 1.269 ˚A. This is
suﬃcient to cover the vibrational levels of interest in the
−
present study. Interaction potential energies between C
2
and the noble gas atoms were determined by subtracting
the asymptotic energies for each bond length.

For C

energies were calculated using the
2x2 Multi-conﬁgurational self-consistent ﬁeld (MCSCF)
method [61, 62] with 10 occupied orbitals and 4 closed or-
bitals followed by a 2-state multi-reference conﬁguration

basis [64] was used on each carbon centre and an aug-

cc-pV5Z basis on the helium atom. For the C
2 -Ne and
Ar systems, convergence problems were encountered for
the MCSCF approach and so energies were instead calcu-
lated using the RCCSD-T method for open shell systems
[65, 66] with complete basis set (CBS) extrapolation us-
ing the aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pV5Z ba-
−
sis sets [67, 68]. The same method for the case of C
2 -He
provided results within a few wavenumbers of the MC-
SCF approach. The basis-set-superposition-error (BSSE)
was also accounted for at all calculated points using the
counterpoise procedure [69].

The three-dimensional PESs were ﬁt to an analytical
form using the method of Werner, Follmeg and Alexander
[70, 71] where the interaction energy is given as

where the ﬁrst terms account for the short range part

the ab initio data (around 40 R points) using imax = 2,
jmin = 4 and jmax = 10 for eight variable parameters.
The average root-mean-square error (RMSE) for each
ﬁt was 0.5 cm−1 for C

for Ar. From the 1D potential ﬁts Bkm(R), the radial

product A(R) = P−1B(R)S−1 where the matrix ele-
ments of P and S are given as Pkl = Pl(cos θk) and

Fig. 2 shows the diagonal terms V0,0(R, θ) for each sys-
tem. As expected for a molecule with a strong bond, the
contour plots of the V0,0(R, θ) for each system are very
similar to our earlier rigid-rotor (RR) PESs which were
obtained without the vibrational averaging (and a diﬀer-
−
ent ab initio method for C
2 -He) [49, 50]. The minimum
values of V0,0 for each system occur at perpendicular ge-
ometries and are around −30 cm−1 at 4.5 ˚A for He, −110
cm−1 at 3.7 ˚A for Ne and −490 cm−1 at 3.7 ˚A for Ar.
Each system’s PES has a fairly similar appearance with
the well depth being the main diﬀerence which increases
as expected from He to Ne to Ar due to the increas-
ing number of electrons on the atoms and on the much
larger dipole polarizabiliy that dominates the long-range
attractive terms with a value of 1.383 a3
0 for He, 2.660 a3
0
for Ne, and 11.070 a3

0 for Ar [72].

The oﬀ diagonal V0,1(R, θ) terms which directly drive
vibrationally inelastic ν = 1 to ν = 0 transitions are
shown in Fig. 3. At short distances the coupling terms
are repulsive, becoming negligible quickly at longer dis-
tances, as is the case for many other atom-diatom sys-
−
tems. It can be seen that for C
2 interacting with He and
Ne the V0,1(R, θ) plots are quite similar but the interac-
tion with Ar is more repulsive. This suggests collisions
with Ar have larger vibrational cross sections as will be
shown below. The V0,2(R, θ) and V1,2(R, θ) matrix ele-
ments have a similar appearance to those of V0,1(R, θ).

The close-coupling scattering calculations discussed
the next section require the vibrationally averaged ma-
trix elements in the form of a multipole expansion as

Vν,ν′ (R, θ) =

λmax

Xλ

V λ
ν,ν′ (R)Pλ(cos θ)

(6)

−
where again due C
2 being a homonuclear diatomic, only
even λ terms are required. The bottom right panels of
Figures 2 and 3 compare the V λ
0,0/1(R) coeﬃcients for the
most important λ = 0, 2 and 4 coeﬃcients. As with the
contour plots of Figure 2, the V λ
0,0(R) expansion coeﬃ-
cients are very similar to their rigid-rotor counterparts
[49, 50]. This means that rotationally inelastic collisions
using the vibrationally averaged multipole expansion will
have very similar values to those obtained using a rigid-
rotor treatment as will be shown in Section V A. As
for other atom-diatom systems, V λ
ν,ν (R) for other vibra-
tional states ν are very similar to those for V λ
0,0(R) and
thus rotations and vibrations can essentially be consid-
ered separately.

For the oﬀ-diagonal expansion coeﬃcients V λ

0,1, all
terms quickly approach zero as R is increased. For all
three systems the V 0
0,1(R) coeﬃcients are steeply repul-
−
sive as R decreases. For the C
2 -He system however the
0,1(R) and V 4
V 2
0,1(R) terms are attractive in contrast to
Ne and Ar which are also repulsive. As expected from the

IV. QUANTUM SCATTERING
CALCULATIONS

Quantum scattering calculations were carried out using
the coupled channel (CC) method to solve the Sch¨odinger
equation for scattering of an atom with a diatomic
molecule as implemented in our in-house code, ASPIN
[73]. The method has been described in detail before
[73, 74] and only a brief summary will be given here,
with equations given in atomic units. For a given total
angular momentum J = l + j the scattering wavefunction
is expanded as

ΨJM (R, r, Θ) =

where l and j are the orbital and rotational angular mo-
( ˆR, ˆr) are coupled-spherical
mentum respectively, Y JM
harmonics for l and j which are eigenfunctions of J.
χν,j(r) are the radial part of the ro-vibrational eigen-
functions of the molecule. The values of l and j are con-
strained, via Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients, such that their
resultant summation is compatible with the total angular
momentum J [73, 74]. f J
νlj(R) are the radial expansion
functions which need to be determined. Substituting the
expansion into the Sch¨odinger equation with the Hamil-
tonian for atom-diatom scattering [73, 74] leads to the
CC equations for each J

In all scattering calculations the C

(13)
−
2 anion was treated
as pseudo-singlet (1Σ) and the eﬀects of spin-rotation
coupling were ignored. In our previous work on this sys-
tem it was shown that a pseudo-singlet treatment of the
rotational state-changing collisions resulted in essentially
the same results as the explicit doublet calculation when
the relevant cross sections were summed [49]. This ap-
proximation reduces the computational cost of the scat-
tering calculations without signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the size
of the cross sections and thus the main conclusions.

To converge the CC equations, a rotational basis set
was used which included up to j = 20 rotational functions
for each vibrational state. The CC equations were prop-
agated between 1.7 and 100.0 ˚A using the log-derivative
propagator [75] up to 60 ˚A and the variable-phase method
at larger distances [76]. The potential energy was inter-
polated between calculated V λ
ν,ν′ (R) values using a cubic
spline. For R < 2.6 ˚A the V λ
ν,ν′ (R) were extrapolated
as aλ
R + bλR while for R > 20 ˚A the λ = 0 terms were
R6 . As our ab initio calculated
extrapolated as
interaction energies were computed to R = 25 ˚A where
the interaction energy is negligible for the temperature of
interest here, the extrapolated form has also a negligible
eﬀect on cross sections [49].

A number of parameters of the calculation were
checked for convergence. The number of λ terms from
Eq. 6 was checked for both rotationally and vibrationally
inelastic collisions. For the former, calculations were con-
verged to better than 1 % using only three terms (up to
λ = 4). For vibrationally inelastic collisions the conver-
gence with increasing λ are less precise: with ﬁve λ terms
convergence to tens of percent is achieved for He and Ne.
For Ar convergence to within about a factor of two is
achieved. This is due to the very small cross sections for
these processes which makes obtaining precise and stable
values more diﬃcult to achieve. For production calcula-
tions, nine λ terms were included for each Vν,ν′ (R).

The eﬀect of the PES ﬁtting function was also checked.
−
For the C
2 -He system a PES ﬁt was carried out using
only three r terms with r = 1.10, 1.2689 and 1.35 ˚A. This

q
 
 
q
 
 
q
 
 
 
 
 
change resulted in tens of percent changes to the vibra-
tionally inelastic cross sections. The ﬁtting function, Eq.
3, does not extrapolate well and this change from a ﬁfth
to third order polynomial ﬁt for r has a drastic eﬀect on
the variation in potential energy with r for values below
and above the range used for ﬁtting. Despite this, the vi-
brationally inelastic cross sections remained reasonably
consistent and thus our r range is suﬃcient to obtain
cross sections which are to the correct order of magni-
tude, suﬃcient to assess rates for vibrational quenching
of C

−
2 with each of the noble gas atoms.

As a ﬁnal check of our calculation parameters, the ef-
fect of the vibrational basis set was also considered. In
all calculations we used the vibrational energies and rota-
tional constants obtained from calculations using LEVEL
−
and employing our own C
2 PEC as discussed in section
II. It was found that for the ν = 1 and ν = 2, which are
the states of interest here (see next section), it was suf-
ﬁcient to only include these states. Including the ν = 3
state had a negligible eﬀect on the ν = 1 and ν = 2
quenching cross sections.

Scattering calculations were carried out for collision en-
ergies between 1 and 1000 cm−1 using steps of 0.1 cm−1
for energies up to 100 cm−1, 0.2 cm−1 for 100-200 cm−1,
1.0 cm−1 for 200-300 cm−1, 2 cm−1 for 300-700 cm−1
and 4 cm−1 for 700-1000 cm−1. This ﬁne energy grid
was used to ensure that important features such as res-
onances appearing in the cross sections were accounted
for and their contributions correctly included when the
corresponding rates were calculated. At low collision en-
ergies, such resonances will be very sensitive to the details
of the PES (see below). The number of partial waves was
increased with increasing energy up to J = 100 for the
highest energies considered.

V. RESULTS

A. Rotationally inelastic cross sections

Rotationally inelastic cross section for C

−
2 -He collisions
can be used to compare our present calculations with
those of our previous work which considered rotation-
ally inelastic collisions treating the anion as a rigid-rotor
[49]. Fig. 4 shows rotationally inelastic cross sections for
selected j → j′ transitions for both excitation and de-
excitation processes. The ﬁgure compares using a vibra-
tionally averaged (VA) PES, that is, only V λ
0,0 coeﬃcients
from Eq. 6, to using the new ab initio PES to carry out
RR calculations at r = req and our previous RR calcula-
tions which used the CCSD(T) method to compute inter-
action energies [49]. The RR calculations do not carry
out the VA procedure of Eq. 5 and instead expansion
coeﬃcients in Eq. 6 are obtained only for r = req.

The diﬀerences between the VA and RR cross sections
obtained using the new PES are small, as is expected
since the ν = 0 vibrational wavefunction is strongly
peaked around r = req. This behaviour was also found

7

for H+
2 -He collisions [77] and justiﬁes our previous treat-
ment of the molecule as a rigid rotor. From Fig. 4 it
can also be seen that the rotationally inelastic collisions
using our new PES are in quite good agreement with
our previous work as anticipated from the similarity of
the multipolar expansion coeﬃcients in Figure 2 to our
previous work [49]. The proﬁles of the cross sections
with energy variation are similar and resonances appear
at similar energies. Cross sections only diﬀer by tens of
percent and these diﬀerences will have a negligible eﬀect
on the corresponding rotationally inelastic rates.

and those of our previous RR PES (short-dashed lines) [49].

Rotationally inelastic collisions can also be used to as-
sess the eﬀect of vibrational state on rotationally inelas-
tic collision. Fig. 5 shows selected rotationally inelas-
−
tic vibrationally elastic cross sections for C
2 -He for the
ν = 0, 1 and 2 vibrational states. As mentioned in Sec-
ν,ν′ coeﬃcients for ν = ν′ are very sim-
tion III, the V λ
ilar resulting in very similar rotationally inelastic cross
sections for a given vibrational state. This insensitiv-
ity of rotationally inelastic cross sections to vibrational
state has been seen for many other molecules undergoing
collisions with He [71, 78–81] and Ar [82, 83] and is a
consequence of the small oﬀ-diagonal vibrational matrix
elements of the PES compared to diagonal ones in Eq. 6.

The results shown in this section for C

−
2 -He collisions
have demonstrated that rotational and vibrational colli-
sions can essentially be considered separately. We have
recently compared rotationally inelastic thermal quench-
−
ing cross sections, rates and times for C
2 in collisions
with He, Ne and Ar and we refer the reader to this work
for further details of this process [50].

The 2D RR PES functions and Legendre expansions
for each system are provided in the Supplementary Ma-
terial [53].

B. Vibrationally inelastic cross sections

As discussed in the Introduction, vibrationally inelas-
−
tic collisions of C
2 with helium buﬀer gas has been sug-
gested to cool the molecules to their ν = 0 vibrational
ground state. As shown in Fig. 1, the ground vibrational
state of the A2Πu electronic state is lower in energy than
the ν = 3 state of the X 2Σ+
g ground electronic state. It
therefore follows that the vibrational states above ν = 2
g can decay to the A2Πu state by dipole allowed
in X 2Σ+
transitions which in turn decay into the ν = 2 and below
vibrational states of X 2Σ+
g [24]. As a consequence, we
only consider here collisional quenching of the long-lived
−
ν = 1 and ν = 2 vibrational states of C
2 in its ground
X 2Σ+

g electronic state.

From Fig. 1 it can also be seen that the ν = 2 vibra-
tional level of the X 2Σ+
g state is close in energy to the
ν′ = 0 state of the excited electronic A2Πu state with
an energy diﬀerence relative to the bottom of the X 2Σ+
g
PEC of ≈ (4837 − 4380) = 457 cm−1 [8]. This close
energy spacing could cause the ν′ = 0 state to perturb
the ν = 2 state through non-adiabatic eﬀects during col-
lisions. This was also a concern for the neutral C2-He
system where for the isolated molecule the energy diﬀer-
ence between the ground X 2Σ+
g and excited a3Πu state
is only around 700 cm−1 [36]. For C2-He rigid-rotor ro-
tationally inelastic scattering, Naja et al. [84] found that
at the C2 X 2Σ+
g equilibrium geometry, the energy sepa-
g and a3Πu states is 2000 cm−1
ration between the X 2Σ+
which remained at this value even with the approach of
the He atom. In this case, electronic state coupling could
be ignored. When vibrations are involved the situation
is more complicated as states can be coupled via the r
vibrational coordinate. This is the case for the H+-CO
and H+-CN systems which have been studied by Ku-
mar et al. [85–87]. For these systems the naked positive
charge of the proton has a strong perturbing eﬀect and
can couple the molecule’s electronic states. The strength

8

n

i | ∂

∂Qn |ψα

of the coupling can be calculated as {ψα
j } where
ψα
i/j are the electronic wavefunctions and the operator
is the ﬁrst (n = 1) or second (n = 2) derivative with
respect to the nuclear coordinate Q (= r for diatomics)
[85–87]. The coupling matrix was used to carry out H+-
CO scattering calculations by constructing diabatic PESs
for two electronic states allowing a computation of elas-
tic, vibrationally inelastic and charge transfer probabil-
ities [88]. The present systems involve the rather weak
interaction of an anion with closed-shell noble gases so
that the gradient couplings between the relevant elec-
tronic states should be smaller than in the case of the
naked proton as a partner as in the case of Kumar et
al.’s work. Kendrick also recently studied HD + H re-
active scattering for excited vibrational states (those en-
ergetically above and below a conical intersection on the
PES) using two coupled diabatic PESs and found signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerences to the adiabatic approach [89]. Kendrick
has also given a detailed approach for non-adiabatic re-
active scattering [90]. To apply these approaches to the
−
2 -He/Ne/Ar systems would involve using an ab initio
C
method such as CASSCF or MRCI to obtain the ground
and electronically excited PESs and assessing them as a
function of R, r and θ coordinates. The coupling matri-
ces could be calculated as described above and diabatic
states constructed. This is somewhat beyond the scope
of this work but whether non-adiabatic eﬀects would al-
ter quenching rates is an interesting question and would
depend on the magnitude of the coupling compared to
inaccuracies in the adiabatic PES.

6 compares vibrationally inelastic rotationally
elastic (for j = j′ = 0) cross sections for the de-excitation
ν = 1 → ν = 0, ν = 2 → ν = 1 and ν = 2 → ν = 0
−
transitions for C
2 colliding with He, Ne and Ar atoms.
At low collisions energies between 0.1 to around 60 cm−1
the cross sections for He and Ne are very small, orders
of magnitude less than rotationally inelastic cross sec-
tions. The ν = 2 → ν = 0 process is an order of
magnitude smaller than the ∆ν = −1 transitions as is
common for cross sections for larger energy diﬀerences
between states. The cross sections show resonances at
lower collision energies. These are likely due to shape or
Feshbach resonances. As is well established, the location
and widths of resonances in the scattering cross sections
at low collision energies are very sensitive to the details
of the PES [91, 92] and there is currently an eﬀorts to
obtain reliable information about scattering observables,
particularly for ultracold regimes, such as the statistical
method of Morita et al. [93]. As we are primarily inter-
ested in assessing the rates for vibrational quenching for
temperatures of 5-100 K, the ﬁne details of the low en-
ergy resonances are less important since the Boltzmann
average over the cross sections in this temperature range
is likely to be far less sensitive to the details of the PES.
For He and Ne, all three processes the cross sections
begin to increase in magnitude above 100 cm−1. This is
a well known trend for vibrationally inelastic collisions
[71, 79–81]. This trend is a consequence of the PES in

Comparing the cross sections for collisions of C

Fig. 2 and the vibrational matrix elements in Fig. 3: the
oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements which couple diﬀerent vibra-
tional states are only signiﬁcant at small R values where
the PES is repulsive. The incoming atom thus requires
a higher kinetic energy to allow the scattering wavefunc-
tion to become signiﬁcant in this region and therefore
−
facilitate vibrational transitions. The C
2 -Ar cross sec-
tions are more constant in value at the higher energies
however, a feature which is likely to be due to the more
attractive potential exhibited by this system, which then
allows the scattering wavefunction to build up more sig-
niﬁcantly in the repulsive region, thereby allowing the
occurrence of larger inelastic vibrational cross sections.
−
2 with
He, Ne and Ar, some general trends are apparent. The
cross sections for Ar are orders of magnitude larger than
those of He and Ne which are broadly similar in size. This
can be rationalized by comparing the interactions shown
in Figures 2 and 3. The well depth of the V0,0(R, θ) el-
−
ements for the C
2 -Ar is far larger than for He and Ne.
This stronger interaction allows the incoming scattering
wavefunction to build up more in the repulsive region
where the oﬀ-diagonal V0,1(R, θ) are signiﬁcant, as op-
posed to He and Ne, for which the coupling potentials
are much smaller. These matrix elements are therefore
larger for Ar, thus giving rise to larger vibrationally in-
elastic cross sections in comparison with those from the
lighter noble gases.

C. Vibrationally inelastic rates

The computed inelastic cross sections of the previous
section can be used to obtain the corresponding thermal
rate constants kν→ν′ (T ), which can be evaluated as the

convolution of the computed inelastic cross sections over
a Boltzmann distribution of the relative collision energies
of the interacting partners as

where Ec = µv2/2 is the kinetic energy.

As discussed in the introduction Section, studies on
−
laser cooling of C
2 have assumed the anion to be initially
cooled to tens of kelvin [6] and thus the rate constants
were computed between 5 and 100 K in 1 K intervals.
Fig. 7 shows the rates for vibrationally inelastic rota-
tionally elastic (j = j′ = 0)transitions corresponding to
the cross sections in Fig. 6. The rates for the vibra-
tional de-excitation processes for He and Ne are quite
similar, particularly for the ν = 1 → ν = 0 transition.
They increase with increasing temperature as expected
from the discussion in Section V B but even at 100 K,
are at least four orders of magnitude smaller than the
rotational de-excitation rates [50]. For Ar the rates are
more constant and are consistently 2 or 3 orders of mag-
nitude larger than those for He or Ne. The vibrational
quenching rates show some variation with the largest
ν = 2 → ν = 1 rate about an order of magnitude larger
than the ν = 1 → ν = 0 and ν = 2 → ν = 0 rates which
themselves are quite similar at the higher temperatures
considered.

The trends in rates on going from He to Ne to Ar
−
in collisions with C
2 are similar to what was found for
rotationally inelastic collisions [50] where the stronger in-
teraction with the Ar atom resulted in larger rates and
faster themalization times compared to He or Ne. The
larger quenching rates for Ar compared with He and Ne
were not easy to predict a priori. Kato, Bierbaum and

Leone measured quenching rates of N+
2 in collisions with
He, Ne, Ar, Xe and Kr at 300 K and found quenching
rates increased with the size of atom [94]. This suggests
that the polarizability of the colliding atom plays an im-
portant role. Ferguson found a similar trend for vibra-
tional quenching of O+
2 with He, Ne and Ar atoms at 300
In contrast Saidani et al calculated quenching
K [95].
rates for CN with He and Ar over a wide range of tem-
peratures and found that cross sections and rates for Ar
were orders of magnitude lower than those for He [96].
However, ionic interactions are driven by diﬀerent forces
than those acting between neutrals, so it is not obvious
how such a result relates to the present ﬁndings for an
anion.

It is well known that generally, vibrational quenching
of molecules due to collisions is ineﬃcient. Measurements
of low temperature rate constants for quenching of the
ν = 1 level include NH undergoing collisions with He
where the rates are of the order of 4×10−15 cm3 s−1
[101]. There are however systems for which collisions are
eﬃcient at quenching vibrational motion. The low fre-
quency stretching mode (100) in SrOH has been shown
to be eﬃciently de-excited in collisions with He [102].
There is also the dramatic case of the BaCl+ + Ca sys-
tem where laser cooled Ca atoms have been shown eﬃ-
ciently quench vibrational motion with rates similar to
rotational transitions [100, 103].

−
The rates and cross sections calculated here for C
2 -
He/Ne/Ar vibrationally inelastic transitions can be com-
pared to other systems. Table III compares cross sections
and rate constants (where available) calculated for vari-
ous systems for ν = 1 → ν = 0 transitions. As a simple
comparison metric, Table III also compares the minimum
of the interaction potential for each system, Vmin. From
the table it can be seen that cationic molecules have

orders of magnitude larger vibrationally inelastic cross
sections and rates compared with neutral systems. The
strength of interaction between the molecule and collid-
ing atom, parameterized here by Vmin, plays a role in the
eﬃciency vibrational quenching as it will allow the scat-
tering wavefunction to build up for geometries where the
coupling matrix is large (Eq. 5). This has also been ra-
tionalised in terms of a statistical model [100] where the
well depth and diatomic vibrational frequency contribute
to the density of states of the complex which increases
the lifetime of the complex and allows eﬃcient quench-
ing. Other factors play a role such as the mass of the
colliding partners (compare the very low rates for CN-Ar
collisions compared to CN-He despite the former having
a lower well depth) and the long-range attraction [95].
Nevertheless Table III shows that in general, cations will
have far larger vibrational quenching rates than neutral
−
molecules. The low rates for C
2 -He vibrational quench-
ing are similar to those of neutrals as expected based
on the relatively weak interaction. To be noted is the
behaviour of the vibrationally inelastic rates when Ar is
taken as the partner gas: the size of the rates brings
their values in the range of those for cations interacting
with He, indicating quantitatively the special behaviour
−
of this noble gas a a partner for C
2 anions in cold traps.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The cross sections and corresponding thermal rates for
−
2 with He, Ne and
ro-vibrationally inelastic collisions of C
Ar have been calculated using a new set of ab initio PESs.
The rotationally inelastic vibrationally elastic cross sec-
tions were found to be insensitive to vibrational state,

rotor [49, 50]. The cross sections and rates for vibrational
quenching from the ν = 1 and ν = 2 states for He and Ne
were found to be orders of magnitude lower than those
obtained for purely rotationally inelastic collisions. The
values of the vibrational quenching rates are found for
this anion to be similar in size to those known for other
small neutral molecules in collision with helium atoms.
For the Ar partner, the vibrationally inelastic rates we
have obtained here were around 3 or 4 orders of magni-
tude larger.

These computed rate coeﬃcients

for vibrational
−
quenching can be used to model the behaviour of C
2 in
ion traps with He, Ne or Ar as buﬀer gas. It turns out, in
fact, that they have signiﬁcant implications for laser cool-
−
ing of C
2 : the ineﬃciency of vibrational quenching found
for He and Ne in our calculations shows how important
the knowledge of vibrational repumping rate coeﬃcients
is for modelling the cyclic scattering of many photons
−
oﬀ C
2 . To quench the states which are being populated
within that cycle by using buﬀer gas collisions, as dis-
cussed in the present study, will require higher pressures

in order to eﬃciently increase the collision frequency in
the trap. Our results suggest therefore that argon would
be a more suitable buﬀer gas to eﬃciently quench the
−
vibrational motion of C
2 as lower pressures will be re-
quired for it as a buﬀer gas in comparison to using either
helium or neon.
