ABSTRACT
We analyze triple systems composed of the super massive black hole (SMBH) near the
center of M87 and a pair of black holes (BHs) with masses in the range 10 − 103 M(cid:12).
We consider the post Newtonian precession as well as the Kozai-Lidov interactions
at the quadruple and octupole levels in modeling the evolution of binary black
hole (BBH) under the inﬂuence of the SMBH. Kozai-Lidov oscillations enhance the
gravitational wave (GW) signal in some portions of the parameter space. We identify
frequency peaks and examine the detectability of GWs with LISA as well as future
observatories such as µAres and DECIGO. We show examples in which GW signal can
be observed with a few or all of these detectors. Multi-Wavelength GW spectroscopy
holds the potential to discover stellar to intermediate mass BHs near the center of
M87. We estimate the rate, Γ, of collisions between the BBHs and ﬂyby stars at the
center of M87. Our calculation suggest Γ < 10 Gyr−1 for a wide range of the mass and
semi-major axes of the inner binary.

1 INTRODUCTION

Black holes (BHs) are ubiquitous in galaxies and form across
a wide range of masses and environments. Stellar-mass BHs
are most abundant, with observational evidence ﬁrst de-
tected in X-rays (Webster & Murdin 1972; Remillard & Mc-
Clintock 2006), and more recently by gravitational waves
(GWs) with LIGO/Virgo (Abbott et al. 2016a,b). Interme-
diate mass black holes (IMBHs) are expected to form from
the accretion of gas in dwarf galaxies (see (Reines et al.
2019) and references therein), mergers of stars in dense stel-
lar clusters (Portegies Zwart et al. 1999; Devecchi & Volon-
teri 2009; Pan & Loeb 2012; Mapelli 2016), from direct col-
lapse of inﬂowing dense gas in protogalaxies (Loeb & Rasio
1994), collapse of Pop III stars from early universe (Madau
& Rees 2001; Bromm & Larson 2004), from supermassive
stars in AGN accretion disk instabilities (McKernan et al.
2012, 2014) or as recently proposed by Giersz et al. (2015) a
consequence of dynamical interaction between hard binaries,
containing stellar mass BH, and other stars and binaries.

Finding unambiguous observational evidence for IMBH
candidates in galactic nuclei is challenging due to the short
lifetime associated with mergers and accretion by the su-
permassive black holes (SMBHs) there (Natarajan 2014;
Johnson & Haardt 2016). There is however some evidence
for their existence in the local Universe (Mezcua 2017). In
particular, Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) imply BHs

with masses above 20 M(cid:12) in some cases (Miller & Col-
bert 2004). A recent discovery of IMBH candidates in dwarf
galaxies at (z (cid:46) 2.4) was reported in the Chandra COSMOS
Legacy Survey (Mezcua et al. 2018), using a sample of 40
active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies with redshift
below 2.4. More recently (Chilingarian et al. 2018) used data
mining in wide-ﬁeld sky surveys and identiﬁed a sample of
305 IMBH candidates in galaxy centers, accreting gas which
creates characteristic signatures of a type I AGN. Most re-
cently, a new sample of Wandering IMBH was discovered
using the large-scale and high resolution radio telescopes
(Reines et al. 2019) in nearby dwarf galaxies.

New probe of IMBH candidates are awaited using 30-
m class telescopes (Greene et al. 2019). IMBH candidates
may also be able to detect using the GW signals in diﬀerent
frequencies (Kocsis & Levin 2012).

SMBHs, with masses in the range 106 − 1010 M(cid:12) are be-
lieved to exist in the core of almost all of massive galax-
ies (Wang et al. 2015; Broderick et al. 2015). This includes
SgrA* at the Galactic center (Ghez et al. 1998; Gravity
Collaboration et al. 2018), as well as the nearby elliptical
galaxy M87 (Gebhardt & Thomas 2009; Gebhardt et al.
2011; Walsh et al. 2013). Most recently the mass of the M87
SMBH was precisely measured by Event Horizon Telescope
(EHT) collaboration (Event Horizon Telescope Collabora-
tion et al. 2019a,b,c,d,e,f) to be 6.5 × 109 M(cid:12). In addition to
the above constraints on the mass of M87, there are some

studies on the proper motion and core stability in Virgo clus-
ter. Walker et al. (2009) monitored the relative position of
M87 and M84 at 43 GHz with the Very Long Baseline Ar-
ray Astrometry(VLBA). This study demonstrated a 5 sigma
detection of a relative motion 800 km/s.

Being at the center of the virgo cluster, M87 is the
nearest giant elliptical galaxy which is the product of many
galaxy mergers. As a result, M87 should contain a large pop-
ulation of stellar mass BHs and possibly a handful of IMBH
candidates which used to be at the center of dwarf galaxies
that merged in. Here we propose to search for this IMBH
populations in M87 through their GW signals.

A large fraction of the IMBH candidates in M87 might
result in binaries in eccentric orbits around the SMBH. This
system is well described by the hierarchical triple approach
(Naoz et al. 2013; Grishin et al. 2017, 2018; Randall &
Xianyu 2019; Hoang et al. 2019; Antonini et al. 2019) in
which the inner binary contains of IMBH candidates while
the outer binary includes the SMBH. The IMBH candidates
in the inner binary are expected to emit bursts of GWs at
any pericenter passage. The frequency of these GW bursts
depend on the orbital parameters.

In this paper, we simulate triple systems composed of
M87 and a pair of the BHs and consider the dynamical evolu-
tion of the binary BHs. The induced Kozai-Lidov oscillations
(Naoz et al. 2013; Antonini et al. 2018; Rodriguez & An-
tonini 2018; Randall & Xianyu 2019; Hoang et al. 2019; An-
tonini et al. 2019) are ubiquitous for low mass BHs. Increas-
ing the mass of BHs in the binary suppresses the strength of
the Kozai-Lidov oscillations. We present examples in which
the GW signal is above the noise of future observatories,
including LISA (Robson et al. 2019; Emami & Loeb 2019),
µ-Ares (Sesana et al. 2019), a newly proposed space based
GW mission with the ability of ﬁlling the gap between the
milli-Hz and nano-Hz frequency windows surveyed by LISA
, and also Decihertz Observatories (DOs) such as the Deci-
hertz Interferometer GW observatory (DECIGO) (e.g. Arca
Sedda et al. (2019) and Refs. in this). Adapting a maximum
observational time of up to 10 yrs, we present examples with
detectable GW signals by these observatories.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we brieﬂy
review the details of the related hierarchical triple system.
In Sec. 3 we introduce the stability conditions that must be
taken into account. In 4.1 we review the ﬁnite time Fourier
transformation for computing the GW signal. In Sec. 4.2
we present a variety of diﬀerent examples with a potentially
detectable GW signal as demonstrated in Sec. 5. In Sec. 6
we brieﬂy consider binaries with non-equal BH masses. In
Sec. 7 we estimate the rate of collision between the inner
BBH and the ﬂyby stars. In Sec. 8 we compute the lifetime
of the related systems. we discuss about the detectability
of the GW signal. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in
Sec. 9.

2 IMPACT OF SMBH ON THE EVOLUTION

OF BBHS

We model the dynamical inﬂuence of a SMBH on the evolu-
tion of BBHs, accounting for inner pericenter precession at
ﬁrst order, quadruple and octupole terms in the Lidov-Kozai
interaction.

The full Hamiltonian of the triple system is given by,

Htot = HLK + H1P N,

(1)

where HLK and H1P N present the Lidov-Kozai Hamilto-
nian and ﬁrst order post Newtonian precession, respectively.
HLK = H1 + H2 + H12 with Hi, i = 1, 2 referring to the Keple-
rian Hamiltonian for the inner and outer binaries in the sys-
tem and H1,2 denoting the interaction term between them.
The interaction term is expressed as a series expansion in
the separation of two binaries. We make use of Eqs. (5-8)
of Antonini et al. (2018); Rodriguez & Antonini (2018) for
modeling the above components of full Hamiltonian.

Using Eq. (1) we derive the equations of motion for the
inner and outer semi-major axes. We also take into account
GW emission in the inner orbit as an extra term that shrinks
the orbit of the BHs.

3 STABILITY CONDITIONS

Here we present some stability conditions that must be taken
into account in our analysis:

• The orbital parameters must be selected such that pre-
vent the inner binary from reaching the Roche limit of the
outer-binary (Hoang et al. 2018; Fragione et al. 2019). This
implies,

1 − eout

.

(2)

The above widely used analytical stability criteria does not
account for possible changes in the Hill radius due to the
inclination (Grishin et al. 2017). However, as it was demon-
strated in (Grishin et al. 2017), the numerical ﬁt gives us an
excellent agreement to the analytical expression up to 120
degree and a marginal agreement afterward.

• The system must possess dynamical stability, implying
that the hierarchical secular treatment is satisﬁed (Naoz &
Silk 2014; Hoang et al. 2018),

< 0.1.

(3)

• For eccentric outer orbits, we add one extra criteria for
the pericenter of the outer orbit. We urge the pericenter
distance to be relatively larger than the event horizon of
SMBH,

aout (1 − eout ) > 2

(cid:18) GMS M BH

(cid:19)

.

(4)

This criteria makes us ensure that the outer orbit does not
hit the event horizon of the SMBH. This is expected as oth-
erwise we lose the outer binary at the ﬁrst pericenter cross-
ing. While this criteria is easier to achieve for moderately
massive SMBH, such as SgrA*, it needs to be checked for a
massive SMBH like M87.

4 GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ESTIMATION

Given the dynamical evolution of the orbital parameters,
we calculate the GW amplitude from eccentric binary black

holes (hereafter EBBHs) and study the detectability of their
GW signal. Using this formalism, we present some examples
with potentially detectable GW signals in M87.

4.1 GW-Computation

Unlike binaries on circular orbits, EBBHs emit GW in a dis-
crete spectrum (Peters & Mathews 1963) with characteristic
frequencies fn = n forb, where n refers to the harmonic index
while forb = (2π)−1(cid:112)G(m1 + m2)a−3/2 is the orbital frequency
in a circular orbit with semi-major a and m1 and m2 refer to
the mass of BHs in the inner binary. The amplitude of the
GW signal is given by,

h(a, e, t) =

hn(a, e, fn) exp (2πi fnt),

where hn(a, e, fn) is deﬁned as,

To gauge the detectability of the GW signal, we divide
the stream of GW into time intervals with a duration ∆T
and perform a Finite Fourier Transformation (FFT) of the
GW strength for the duration ∆T. The Fourier component
of the GW signal can be computed by taking a time integral
of Eq. (5) from −(∆T/2) to (∆T/2) yielding,

tories. As discussed in the introduction, we will consider
several diﬀerent GW detectors, including LISA, µ-Ares and
DECIGO.

4.2 GW signal in M87

Having presented a formalism to compute the GW signal
for a generic system, we now apply it to the case of M87.
Since D = 16Mpc, we choose a relatively large value for the
observational time, ∆T. From Eq. (8), a large ∆T has two
diﬀerent eﬀects, though. On the one hand, it enhances the
GW amplitude. On the other hand, it diminishes the fre-
quency width of the GW signal as ( f − fn) (cid:39) 1/∆T. This
leads to a discrete spectrum of observable frequencies. The
combination of these two eﬀects lead to a range of ∆T that
can lead to an observable GW signal at a range of discrete
frequencies.

To clarify the above points, we present some examples
with potentially detectable GW signals at diﬀerent frequen-
cies. We choose ∆T diﬀerently in each of these examples to
both help pushing the GW signals above the noise as well
as increasing the amount of observable frequencies.

Throughout our analysis, we neglect the GW bursts
from the inspiral phase of IMBH around M87. In another
paper (Emami & Loeb 2019), we estimated the timescale
associated with these bursts to be,

It is easy to see that τGW (cid:39) O(Gyr) is much longer than
both of the observational time and the lifetime of the orbit
of IMBH. Therefore, we can safely ignore the GW decay
time in our analysis.

4.2.1 Probing GW in LISA

The observational interval ∆T plays an important role. For
close-in sources, the strength of GW is large enough to allow
smaller values of ∆T. This leads to wider frequency bins, as
f − fn (cid:39) 1/∆T. The situation is diﬀerent for wide-separation
binary systems, where the observational time ∆T must be
larger. Therefore the GW signal is localized in the frequency
domain around speciﬁc harmonics. We deﬁne characteristic
detectable frequencies which are aimed to be within the fre-
quency range of LISA or ground based GW detectors,

fmin ≤ f ≡ fn ± α/∆T ≤ fmax,

(10)

where α (cid:46) 1 and with fn = n forb.
Next, we deﬁne the characteristic strain of the GW signal
as,

c(a, e, f ) ≡ 4 f 2| ˜h(a, e, f )|2.

(11)

To check the detectability of the GW signal, Eq. (11) must

MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2019)

First, we consider GWs in the LISA band. We adopt the
LISA noise curve (Robson et al. 2019; Emami & Loeb 2019)
and present the characteristic GW signal on the top of that.
Figure 1 shows the GW signal in the LISA band for few
diﬀerent equal mass binaries with each component having,
˜m(≡ m/M(cid:12)) = (10, 50, 100, 300, 500, 700, 1000). The rest of the
parameters are chosen to be the same: ˜ain = 0.05, ˜aout =
4000, ein = 0.7, eout = 0.7, where hereafter ˜a ≡ (a/AU). On
the left panel, we use an interpolation for the points with
π( f − fn)∆T < 1, whereas the right panel, presents the points
satisfying π( f − fn)∆T < 1. We adopt ∆T = (8, 7, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.5)

Hz, it is advantageous to use the newly proposed µ-Ares

f ∼ (0.01 − 1)
Finally, we consider decihertz frequencies,
Hz, which are particularly suitable to IMBHs (Arca Sedda
et al. 2019). There are currently diﬀerent proposed technolo-
gies for probing the GWs within this frequency range. They
include DO-optimal, DO-conservative, Advanced Laser In-
terferometer Antenna (ALIA) and decihertz Interferometer
GW observatory (DECIGO) (see, e.g Arca Sedda et al.
(2019) and Refs. therein). In our analysis below, we fo-
cus on DECIGO. Figure 3 presents the characteristic GW
strain against various detectors including the LISA (blue
line), µAres (black line) and DECIGO (purple line) for
∆T = (10, 8, 5, 3) yrs.

There are clearly overlapping regions in frequency for
these three observatories. This is particularly helpful
in
removing degeneracies between various parameters in the
system. Multi-wavelength spectroscopy of GW can provide
novel information about the parameters of the BBHs that
are otherwise degenerate, and could be potentially used as
a way to discover IMBHs in M87.

4.2.4 Time evolution of GW amplitude

Having presented the frequency evolution of the GW
signal
for a ﬁxed time, we next study how the signal
changes with time. In Figure 4, we draw the evolved

MNRAS 000, 1–9 (2019)

In our simulations, we ﬁx some of the orbital parame-
ters such as the arguments of pericenter for the inner and
outer binaries (taken to be 0◦), longitude of ascending node
for inner and outer binaries (chosen to be 0◦) and mu-
tual inclination (taken to be 90◦). We have also taken the
BHs to have zero spins, but allowed rest of the parame-
ters to vary. This includes the inner and outer semi-major
axes and eccentricities. We noticed that changing the outer
semi-major axis has very minor impact on the results as
long as the BBH is far from the tidal disruption distance,
aout (cid:29) ain(MS M BH /MBH )1/3. Similarly, changing eout does
not aﬀect the signal signiﬁcantly. On the other hand, chang-
ing ain and especially ein aﬀect the strength of the signal
dramatically. Owing to the importance of these parameters,
we consider their eﬀect on the GW signal for multiple de-
tectors.

Figure 5 presents the inﬂuence of ein on the GW signal,
assuming ˜m = 300, eout = 0.6, ˜ain = 0.1 and ˜aout = 4000. The
resulting GW signal could be observed by µAres, LISA or
DECIGO detectors.

Finally, in Figure 6 we examine the impact of changing
˜ain = (0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) on the detectability of GW
signal. Here we adopt ˜m = 300, ein = 0.7, eout = 0.6, ˜aout =
6000. The plot shows that changing ain only aﬀects slightly
the GW signal.

5 DETECTABILITY OF GW SIGNAL

Next, we consider the detectability of GW signals for some
of the examples above. We compute the signal to noise ratio
(S/N) using Eq. (12), and label a GW signal as detectable
if S/N ≥ 10. The exact lower limit in S/N is not ﬁxed. Dif-
ferent values are used in the literature. For example Hoang
et al. (2019) used S/N ≥ 5 as the criteria of detection. Here
we use a more conservative criteria of 10 as our detection
limit. Since diﬀerent GW detectors are focused on diﬀerent
frequency bands, we need to deﬁne the frequency bands for
diﬀerent detectors using Eq. (12). Table 1 presents the fre-
quency ranges for diﬀerent GW detectors. Although for most
cases we take the universal upper and lower limits in the in-
tegrals, the lower limit for µAres depends on the minimum
value of the frequency, which could be slightly larger than
10−6Hz. Owing to this, we take the maximum value between
10−6Hz and fm, deﬁned to be the minimum value of the fre-
quency of GW signal. Likewise, for the LISA experiment,
we take the minimum value of the frequency of signal as the
lower limit of the integral.

In addition, since the GW frequency is chirped towards
the merger, the computation of the SN also depends on
the approximate point in the evolution of the system. In
other words, the time evolution of the system aﬀects the
GW signal and so the S/N. Therefore, lower signal to noise
may evolve with time and get enhanced. With this in our
mind, in the following we present S/N ratio for one set of
the examples. Table 2 presents the signal to noise ratio for

Figure 7. GW signal for non-equal BH masses. Here we adopt
m1 = 100M(cid:12) and consider diﬀerent values for its companion mass
in the range m2 = (30, 50, 100, 300, 500, 700)M(cid:12). The remaining or-
bital parameters are taken to be ai n = 0.1AU, ein = 0.4, eout =
0.6, aout = 6000AU.

the case with ˜m ≡ m/M(cid:12) = (10, 50, 100, 300, 500, 700, 1000)
and with ˜ain = 0.1, ˜aout = 4000, ein = 0.8, eout = 0.7, and
∆T = (9, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1)yr. The GW signal is evaluated at the
same time for all cases. Since the dynamical evolution of dif-
ferent BHs diﬀer depending on their masses, the orbital and
peak freak frequency,

fp = 2 for b

(1 + ein)1.1954

is diﬀerent in these examples. Therefore over the time, the
location of signal changes for diﬀerent BH masses and we
may put them in the same location if we look at individual
ones at diﬀerent times.

6 NON-EQUAL MASS BHS

So far, we only focused on the BBHs with equal masses.
Here we brieﬂy consider the case with non-equal BH masses.
As a test example, we ﬁx the mass of one of BHs to be
m1 = 100M(cid:12) and change the mass of its companion in the
range m2 = (30, 50, 100, 300, 500, 700)M(cid:12). The rest of the or-
bital parameters are taken to be ain = 0.1AU, ein = 0.4, eout =
0.6, aout = 6000AU. Figure 7 presents the GW signal for this
regime.

Unlike the examples in Sec. 5, we evaluate the GW sig-
nal at the time for which the peak frequency (deﬁned in Eq.
14) to be around fp = 3 × 10−4Hz. This makes the GW signal
behave very similarly. Therefore the peak frequency is a key
parameter in our system and leads to an almost universal
behavior at diﬀerent BH masses. In closing, we note that
each IMBH may carry a cluster of stellar-mass BHs around
it, enhancing the rate of detectable GW signals from its
vicinity.

7 INTERACTION BETWEEN BBH AND

FLYBYS

So far we considered the impact of the SMBH on the evolu-
tion of BBHs at M87 and its imprint on gravitational waves.
We ignored the impact of any ﬂybys in the evolution of
system. Since M87 is surrounded by a stellar cluster, there
might be some ﬂyby stars that reach BBHs. It is therefore
intriguing to have an order of magnitude estimation on the
rate of collisions leaving its comprehensive study for a future
paper.

The rate of diﬀerent collisions and dynamical interac-
tions in galactic nuclei and globular clusters have been con-
sidered in Leigh et al. (2016, 2014, 2018). Following Leigh
et al. (2018), we compute the rate of interaction between
an inner BBH and a cloud of stars belonging to the stel-
lar cluster around M87. We ignore the impact of the stellar
disk and focus on the dispersion supported spherical stellar
component of M87. The rate of collisions between the inner
BBH and stars is given by Leigh et al. (2018),

where ρ(r) and σ(r) describe to the mass density of dis-

next to SMBH with r referring to the distance from the cen-
tral SMBH. Here, ve = (cid:16) 2G M
describes the escape ve-
locity from the BBH. Finally, in the above formula we take
M and R to be the mass of BBH as well as the semi-major
of orbit, respectively.

For the density proﬁle, ρ(r), we use Figure 9 of Murphy
et al. (2011) to infer the total enclosed mass of stars at every
radius r from M87. Density proﬁle can then be computed
from the derivative of the enclosed mass. We ﬁt a non-linear
function to the density proﬁle and extend it to smaller radii
above the data resolution. The left panel in Figure 8 presents
the density proﬁle of M87 for Murphy et al. (2011) and our
non-linear ﬁt.

Using the above extended mass/density proﬁles, we

next compute the velocity dispersion as,

Figure 9. Collision rate of inner BBH and the ﬂyby stars. M and
R refer to the mass and semi-major axes of BBH, respectively.

Plugging the above results back into Eq. (9), we ﬁnd
that the collision rate of stars to BBH, Γ, depends on the
BBH mass and semi-major as well as the distance from the
center. To estimate Γ, we ﬁx r = 6000 AU = 0.03 pc (cid:39) 46.6
Rg and compute the collision rate as a function of the BBH
mass and inner semi-major axes.

Figure 9 displays the behavior of log10 (Γ/Gyr−1) as a
function of the logarithm of BBH mass, log10 (M/M(cid:12)) and
logarithm of semi-major axes log10 (R/AU). As expected, the
rate enhances for larger/smaller BBH semi-major/mass, re-
spectively.

8 LIFETIME OF ORBITS

Finally, we consider the lifetime of BBHs orbits under con-
sideration. By the lifetime we mean the time that it takes for
an inner binary with given initial parameters to merge. The
above timescale is not meant to represent the detectability
window. In Emami & Loeb (2020) we computed the rate for
the inspiral of stellar mass BHs around the SMBH. Nonethe-
less the above timescale provides a sense about the lifetime
of a given orbit under consideration. Binaries with very short
lifetime do not survive. Their replenishment requires some
secondary process after the merger such as gas supply (Se-
cunda et al. 2019). On the other hand, binaries with long
lifetime have a better chance of being seen in the real ob-
servations provided that they are not evaporated or tidally
disrupted by the close ﬂybys. Yet, since we are mostly in-
terested in IMBHs with relatively large masses, the chance
for a BBH to get destroyed by some dynamical interactions
is not expected to be high. A comprehensive analysis of the
rate of these binaries including the above eﬀects goes beyond
the scope of this paper.

Figure 10 presents the lifetime of BBHs for diﬀerent
values of their masses and as a function of ein and ain. For
simplicity, we only focus on equal mass BHs. From the plot
it is clear that the lifetime of the BBHs is a strong function
of the orbital parameters as well as the BH masses. As ex-

pected, the lifetime increases by decreasing the values of ein
and increasing the value of ain.

9 CONCLUSIONS

Multi-Wavelength GW detectors can monitor the spectrum
of GW signals from the center of M87 over a wide range
of frequencies and orbital parameters. GW spectroscopy en-
ables one to reproduce the shape of the GW signal and get
novel information about the physical process behind such
signals. Focusing on triple systems in M87 made of an inner
binary BHs with diﬀerent masses, from stellar to IMBHs,
we presented a consistent method for detecting GW sig-
nals by integrating over the observation time within the
lifetime of diﬀerent GW detectors. We demonstrated that
the frequency peaks from various GW sources can be used
to entangle the signal from closer in sources with continuum
frequency bands. The parameter space where diﬀerent GW
detectors may overlap in their frequency of GWs, could be
used as a novel way to break the degeneracy between diﬀer-
ent orbital parameters.

We estimated the rate of collision between the BBHs in
M87 and the ﬂyby stars belong to the stellar cluster at the
central region of M87. Though the collision rate depends
on the mass and the semi-major axes of inner binary, our
results imply that the rate is smaller than 10 Gyr−1 for the
wide range of parameters considered here.

A more detailed numerical simulation over a wider time
range including all of the possible encounters between dif-
ferent BHs is left for a future investigation.
