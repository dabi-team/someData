Abstract

We analyze data from the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instru-
ments on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to characterize the spatio-temporal acoustic power distribution
in active regions as a function of the height in the solar atmosphere. For this, we use Doppler velocity and continuum
intensity observed using the magnetically sensitive line at 6173 ˚A as well as intensity at 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A. We focus on
the power enhancements seen around AR 11330 as a function of wave frequency, magnetic ﬁeld strength, ﬁeld inclination
and observation height. We ﬁnd that acoustic halos occur above the acoustic cutoﬀ frequency and extends up to 10 mHz
in HMI Doppler and AIA 1700 ˚A observations. Halos are also found to be strong functions of magnetic ﬁeld and their
inclination angle. We further calculate and examine the spatially averaged relative phases and cross-coherence spectra
and ﬁnd diﬀerent wave characteristics at diﬀerent heights.

1. Introduction

The interpretation of acoustic waves surrounding ac-
tive regions has been a diﬃcult task since the inﬂuence of
magnetic ﬁeld on incident acoustic waves is not fully un-
derstood (see Moradi et al., 2010, for a review). Models
point out that the waves leak into the higher atmosphere
through active regions that convert a signiﬁcant amount
of energy into magnetosonic fast waves (Schunker & Cally,
2006). These waves are then reﬂected back to the interior
and in this process the phase of the acoustic wave is altered
(Cally, 2007). It has also been argued that the helioseismic
inversions for sound speed are contaminated by surface ef-
fects associated with the strong magnetic ﬁeld (Couvidat
& Rajaguru, 2007). Recent numerical simulations (Cally
& Moradi, 2013) further suggest that processes occurring
higher up in the atmosphere can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the
inferences from local helioseismology in the presence of
strong ﬁelds due to the contamination of the seismic sig-
nals at the surface. Two such phenomena; e.g. absorption
of p-modes in sunspots around 3 mHz (Jain et al., 2014,
and references therein) and enhancement of power around
6 mHz, known as acoustic halos, are signatures of wave
interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld (Schunker & Braun,
2011, and references therein).

The acoustic halos were ﬁrst observed in Dopplergrams
as a power enhancement around 6 mHz (Braun et al.,
1987). This was soon followed by other studies both at
photospheric and chromospheric heights (Braun et al., 1992;
Brown et al., 1992; Toner & Labonte, 1993). Subsequent
investigations could not ﬁnd such halos in continuum in-
tensity (Braun et al., 1992; Hindman & Brown, 1998; Jain
& Haber, 2002). Both these studies used data from the
Michelson Magnetic Imager (MDI, Scherrer et al., 1995)
on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO,
Domingo et al., 1995) which observes the solar photosphere
in Ni I line at 6768 ˚A. The MDI Doppler signal is formed at
around 125 km while the line core peaks at around 300 km
(Fleck et al., 2011; Norton et al., 2006). Enhanced power
6.8 mHz) bands have also been ob-
in high frequency (5.8
served in global oscillation data (Simoniello et al., 2010).
With the availability of improved data sets mostly from
space-borne instruments, both observational and theoreti-
cal studies have enriched the ﬁeld and have conﬁrmed that
the chromospheric modes are the extension of the p-modes
seen in the photosphere.

jaguru et al. (2013a) have also examined the power maps
around four active regions as a function of the magnetic
ﬁeld strength, inclination angle and observation height.
Although there are several theories to explain the mech-
anism behind the halos, none of them explain all of the
properties associated with acoustic halos. Recent forward
modeling and numerical simulations (Rijs et al., 2015, 2016)
suggest that the power halo is wholly dependent on return-
ing fast waves.

In this context, our goal is to investigate how the mag-
netic ﬁeld inﬂuences the acoustic oscillations from the pho-
tosphere to chromosphere by examining the distribution of
the acoustic power as a function of the height in the solar
atmosphere by using multi-wavelength data on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell et al., 2012).
Although this analysis is similar to that of Rajaguru et al.
(2013a), we concentrate on the properties of a single com-
plex active region while the former authors surveyed the
average properties by combining all the four active regions.
For the analysis presented here, we choose the NOAA
active region (AR) 11330 which consist of a well deﬁned
leading spot surrounded by plage of both polarities. We
analyse the active region during 27-28 October 2011 when
it was located on the central meridian at latitude 10.12◦ N
(absolute heliographic longitude 249◦, see Table 1 for de-
tails). The active region is classiﬁed as having βγ con-
ﬁguration and is not associated with any ﬂare during the
time period considered in this analysis. We also exam-
ine the phase and coherence spectrum between a pair of
observables to study the characteristics of wave propaga-
tion. The data used in this study are downloaded from the
Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC)1 based at Stan-
ford University.

2. Data Reduction

The multi-wavelength data, which represents diﬀerent
layers of the solar atmosphere, are taken from the Helio-
seismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al., 2012)
and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al.,
2012) on board the SDO. Speciﬁcally, we use continuum
intensity (I) and Doppler (V ) data from HMI which are
produced at a cadence of 45 seconds from observations
of the Fe I line at 6173 ˚A with a spatial sampling of 0.5
arcsec/pixel which equates to a spatial resolution of 1 arc-
sec at optical wavelengths. The formation height of this
line spans the range from 20 km above the visible sur-
face in the wings to 270 km in the core (Norton et al.,
2006) which has been estimated using the Maltby-M um-
bral model (Maltby et al., 1986) while the calculation of
Fleck et al. (2011) shows that the mean formation height
for the Fe I line is approximately 100 km, which is slightly
lower in height than the MDI Ni I Doppler signal with a
125 km. Fleck et al. (2011) further
formation height of

state that the apparent formation height of the Doppler
signal could increase by 40 to 50 km due to the limited
spatial resolution of the instrument. We also note that
the line formation height for continuum intensity for both
20 km (Norton et al.,
HMI and MDI instruments is
2006).

≈

We also use the HMI photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld
measurements obtained from a second vector camera, iden-
tical to one measuring Doppler shift, with a cadence of
135 seconds (Hoeksema et al., 2014). Particularly, we use
a data product designated as the space-weather HMI ac-
tive region patches (SHARPS: Bobra et al., 2014). This
series contains various parameters calculated from the pho-
tospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld data and is based on the
the HMI pipeline code that automatically detects active
regions in photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms and in-
tensity images and tracks the region as it rotates across the
disk (Turmon et al., 2014). Each active region is referred
to HMI Active Region Patch (HARP) and is assigned a
HARP number. The SHARP data series provide maps of
the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld, inclination angle of
the ﬁeld to the line-of-sight, azimuth angle and the corre-
sponding uncertainties along with many other parameters
at a cadence of 720 seconds. In this study, we use the data
that has been remapped from CCD coordinates to a heli-
ographic cylindrical equal-area (CEA) projection centered
on the patch and the magnetic ﬁeld values are represented
as spherical vector-ﬁeld components. Thus vector B is
transformed into the components Br, Bθ, and Bφ and are
available as FITS ﬁles. From these data sets, we compute
the total magnetic ﬁeld, B, and ﬁeld inclination angle, γ,
which are average values over the period of observation
used in this analysis. These are deﬁned as :

from the JSOC archive and the series hmi.sharp cea 720s.997
corresponds to AR 11330. The remapped SHARP data has
a spatial size of 917 x 536 pixels with a sampling rate of
0.03 degree per pixel.

The AIA instrument is an array of four telescopes that
provide full disk images of 4096
4096 pixels in diﬀerent
UV and EUV wavelength bands and has a spatial sam-
pling of 0.6 arcsec/pixel with a spatial resolution of 1.5
arcsec. For this analysis, we select two wavelength chan-
nels 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A (I1600 and I1700, respectively)
which have been shown to be useful for helioseismic stud-
ies (Howe et al., 2012; Rajaguru et al., 2013a; Tripathy
et al., 2012). The 1700 ˚A ﬁlter covers mostly UV contin-
uum while the 1600 ˚A ﬁlter intensity is a combination of a

continuum background and some contribution of C IV. Al-
though these observations have a cadence of 24 sec, we use
non-consecutive images i.e. observations with a cadence
of 48 sec which is closer to the cadence of the HMI obser-
vation. Since the HMI and AIA data have diﬀerent spatial
resolution and cadence, we align the images following the
procedure described in section 2.1.

There are various ways to determine formation heights
of intensities. Uitenbroek (2004) calculated the optical
depth unity of the continua at 1600 and 1700 ˚A in a cross-
section through a three-dimensional snapshot of solar con-
vection. He found the heights to vary between 300 and
550 km for 1600 ˚A and 150 and 350 km for 1700 ˚A with
a mean at about 450 and 275 km, respectively. However,
as noted earlier, 1600 ˚A ﬁlter intensity is a combination
of a continuum background and some contribution of C
IV. Thus, Fossum & Carlsson (2005) used hydrodynamic
simulations, and by folding the derived intensities with the
Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE, Handy
et al., 1999) ﬁlter transmission functions for the 1700 ˚A
and 1600 ˚A ﬁlters estimated the average formation heights
to be 360 and 430 km with widths of 325 and 185 km, re-
spectively. Since the design of the AIA instrument is based
on many features that were successful for the TRACE
instrument, we consider these derived heights to be the
same formation heights for the corresponding passbands
employed with the AIA instrument. Previously, Judge
et al. (2001) had also estimated that the 1700 ˚A TRACE
bandpass has a typical formation height in the range
300
the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere.

However, it is important to note that most of the heights
referred to here correspond to quiet Sun regions and it
is highly desirable to infer the formation heights of these
observables for magnetized atmospheres. There has been
some evidence that in high ﬁeld regions the actual forma-
tion height of the line dips below the average formation
height due to the low gas pressure and density since the
magnetic ﬁeld also contributes to balancing the higher gas
pressure of the nonmagnetic medium (Uitenbroek, 2003).
For example, as described in Norton et al. (2006), the
formation height of the core of the 6173 ˚A ﬁlter used in
HMI instrument diﬀers approximately by 33 km between a
sunspot (Maltby-M model, Maltby et al., 1986) and quiet
(VAL-C model, Vernazza et al., 1981) Sun models.

It has been argued by Howe et al. (2012), that the
strong global p-mode signal in both AIA bands can not
originate as high as the transition layer. It is possible that
the helioseismic response in these passbands specially in
AIA 1600 ˚A band is associated with the continuum rather
than the C IV line and pertains to a height range not
very far above the 1700 ˚A band. There is also a possibil-
ity that a ﬂaring event occurring higher in the transition
layer could aﬀect the power in the layers below. In order
to avoid such inﬂuences, we have chosen this particular
active region where no ﬂare occurred either in X-ray or
optical wavelengths prior to, or during, the period consid-

ered in this analysis as prepared by Space Weather Pre-
diction Center (SWPC)2. Nonetheless, given the dynamic
nature of the corona, small scale and short-lived heating
events (nano- and micro-ﬂares) may occur higher in the at-
mosphere which may aﬀect the brightening in the 1600 ˚A
channel. However, our method of normalizing power maps
with quiet-Sun average would take care of the inﬂuence of
such contributions. Moreover, the analysis spans over a
period of 16 hours and hence we believe that any contam-
ination from transition layer as a result of the short-lived
heating events do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the results pre-
sented here.

2.1. Alignment of Data Sets

Since the HMI images have diﬀerent resolution than
AIA images and can have diﬀerent roll angles, we follow
the guidelines described in SDO document center3 and use
the SolarSoft4 routine aia prep.pro to align the HMI im-
ages to have the same resolution and orientation as the
AIA images. These re-aligned images were then remapped
to a spatial size of 917 x 536 pixels using azimuthal equidis-
tant projection and is tracked at the Carrington rotation
rate for 16 hours with a sampling rate of 0.03 degree per
pixel to match the SHARP data. We further interpolate
HMI data cubes to the AIA cadence of 48 seconds.

Since the HMI and AIA images were tracked for 16
hours while the SHARP data was tracked over the life
time of the AR by the HMI pipeline (the tracking rate
and remapping are identical), the alignment of the images
were further checked by performing cross-correlation anal-
ysis over mean images. We found that the average B and
γ images were oﬀset by 13.23 and 0.44 pixels in x and y
direction, respectively compared to mean HMI and AIA
data cubes. The mean B and γ images were appropri-
ately shifted by the above amount so that all the images
were aligned with an accuracy of 1 pixel. For the analysis
described in the rest of the paper, an area of 384
384
pixels covering the active region consisting of a well de-
ﬁned leading spot surrounded by plages of both polarity
was selected in each observable. As a ﬁnal step, we sub-
tract a running mean of 15 min from HMI and AIA data
cube to remove daily variations. Figure 1 shows context
images of the active region in diﬀerent observables.

pixels in each spatial direction, and was placed at the same
latitude and longitude as the AR. This data was processed
in an identical way as the active region i.e. remapped us-
ing azimuthal equidistant projection and tracked at the
Carrington rate for 16 hours on 09 June 2010. The start
and end time of each observable is tabulated in Table 2.
The power maps are produced by calculating the power in
each pixel of the data cubes using a fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and summed over a 1 mHz band of frequencies cen-
tered every 0.1 mHz in the frequency range of 1
10.5
mHz. The maps were further smoothed over three bins
in each spatial direction so that any fractional misalign-
ment between diﬀerent observables do not bias the result
presented here.

As is known from earlier studies involving MDI data
(Hindman & Brown, 1998; Jain & Haber, 2002), the power
maps of continuum intensity observation (bottom panels)
do not show any power halos since the line formation
height of the intensity observable for both MDI and HMI
instruments is similar (
20 km) and is well below the
formation height of HMI V and AIA intensities. From
the Doppler observations, we notice the well-known sup-
pression of power in the 3 mHz band (Woods & Cram,
1981; Lites et al., 1982; Brown et al., 1992), and enhance-
ment of power at higher frequencies which is manifested
as enhanced power rings around the sunspot at 7 mHz. At
9 mHz, we observe more diﬀused power enhancement over
the active region. The narrow regions of power enhance-
ment inside the umbra of the sunspot in the 7 mHz and
9 mHz band appears to be an artifact. These could be due
to the leaking of magnetic ﬁeld to the Doppler velocity
observation near the strongest ﬁeld strength since the Fe
I spectral line at 6173 ˚A is magnetically sensitive. Hoek-
sema et al. (2014) found that the velocity sensitivity of
the daily variation increases with ﬁeld strength. Couvidat
et al. (2016) further showed that the line-of-sight algo-
rithm produces signiﬁcant errors in the presence of strong
magnetic ﬁeld as the shape of the Fe I line in a strong and
inclined ﬁeld diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the synthetic pro-
ﬁle and Voigt proﬁle used to produce the look-up tables
in places where high velocity is present (see Fig. 22 of
Couvidat et al., 2016)

The power maps for AIA 1700 ˚A and AIA 1600 ˚A show
more complex structures. The network regions clearly
show the 5 min acoustic oscillations. At the higher fre-
quency of 5 mHz, the power is suppressed in both AIA
channels while at 7 mHz and 9 mHz excess power around
the sunspot is seen in AIA 1700 ˚A similar to the Doppler
observations. However, AIA 1600 ˚A observations show
the presence of weak enhancements at very few locations
as compared to 1700 ˚A channel. This can be more clearly
visualized in Figure 3, where we have superposed the con-
tours on the power maps. The colors blue, yellow and red
represent enhanced power levels of 1.2, 1.5, and 2.0 over
the quiet Sun, respectively and distinctly illustrates the
power halos for HMI V and AIA 1700 ˚A observables. For
Doppler observations, our analysis is consistent with the

study of Howe et al. (2012) where enhancements were seen
as rings around the sunspot for AR 11072. However dif-
ferences are seen in the AIA channels. Howe et al. (2012)
ﬁnd high-frequency halos around the entire active region
while we observe partial and diﬀused power halos. In our
previous study (Tripathy et al., 2012) full halos were ob-
served around AR 11092. Since both AR 11072 and 11092
were simple active regions while AR 11330 was more com-
plex and covers the entire cube (See Figure 1), we pre-
sume that it is the complexity of the active region that
controls the extent of the halos at greater height. This
assumption appears to be supported through the analysis
of Rajaguru et al. (2013a) where four active regions con-
sisting of two simple and two moderately complex ARs
were analyzed. For simple ARs, full halos were observed
at AIA wavelengths while for complex or extended active
regions, the halos appeared to be diﬀused. It is also to be
noted that observations made in the same AIA band by the
TRACE instrument reveal contradicting results. While
Krijger et al. (2001) reported halos or “aureoles” in both
AIA 1700 ˚A and AIA 1600 ˚A channels, Muglach (2003)
reported power decrease in the surroundings of the active
region when the frequency was binned over 5.5
7.5 mHz.
The later results could be due to the adopted analysis pro-
cedure where all power with a probability less than 95%
was set to 0 and not included when calculating the fre-
quency bins. Since the underlying mechanism of power
enhancement is still being debated and appears to vary
between diﬀerent active regions, a statistical investigation
of power maps of many active regions is warranted but is
beyond the scope of the present paper.

3.1. Magnetic Field and Power Distribution

One of the major advantage of SDO data is the avail-
ability of vector magnetic ﬁeld measurements.
In this
study, we use the magnetic ﬁeld strength, B, and the
ﬁeld inclination, γ, to analyze the power distribution as
a function of the frequency. Since, we are interested to
investigate the power enhancements and not suppression
which occurs in the umbra and penumbra regions of the
sunspot, we restrict our analysis to regions where B is less
than 850 G to be consistent with the study of Rajaguru
et al. (2013a). The normalized power i.e. the power of the
active region normalized by the power of the quiet region
is averaged over 10 G bins in B and 4◦ in γ so that the
power distribution can be analyzed either as a function of
the magnetic ﬁeld or ﬁeld inclination or a combination of
the two. The choice of grouping is identical to that used
in Rajaguru et al. (2013a).

Figure 4 shows the power as a function of the magnetic
ﬁeld and frequency, where the magnetic ﬁeld is averaged
over 10 G bins. The panels show the power structure for
the Doppler velocity and two AIA intensities. The ﬁrst
thing to notice is that the power enhancement begins at
about 5 mhz for V and 6 mhz for I1700 and extends up
to 10 mHz in both observations. At the lowest height cor-
responding to the Doppler velocity (neglecting the contin-

4

uum intensity since no halos are seen), the halos can be ob-
served both at weak and strong ﬁeld regions and the struc-
ture varies with frequency. We also notice power reduction
for very low magnetic ﬁeld between 6
8 mHz range. As
we progress to greater heights, we observe that the halos
are conﬁned to intermediate ﬁeld strengths (B
350 G) at
the height of I1700, while at the height of I1600, we detect
very localized enhancements aroundB
800 G which
are not at the locations of the halo and appear to corre-
spond to the power enhancements seen near the sunspot
boundary in Figure 2.

In contrast, the simulated power structure presented
in Rijs et al. (2016) shows diﬀerent characteristics as com-
pared to our observations presented here. The simulated
Doppler observations show formation of halos over weak to
moderate ﬁeld (50 G < B < 700 G) and can be seen up to
10 mHz for low B with a band of power reduction at higher
frequencies. However, the power distribution for the syn-
thetic AIA bands shows power excess only at low values
of B < 100 G which is very diﬀerent from our measure-
ments. The diﬀerence may be attributed to the topology
of the analyzed active region as compared to the numerical
simulations with a simpliﬁed axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld
and ﬁeld inclination.

≈

−

We next explore the power as a function of the ﬁeld
inclination angle averaged over 4◦ bins (Figure 5). For
Doppler observations, power halos begin at about ν >
6 mHz but are mostly conﬁned to low to moderate and
45◦). As the ﬁeld nears
0◦
positive inclined ﬁelds (γ
vertical orientation, the halos shift to higher frequencies,
and for vertical ﬁelds the halos are conﬁned to frequencies
of about 9.5 mHz. When the inclination is negative (ﬁeld
pointing in the opposite direction) power enhancement is
only observed at frequencies & 8 mHz. The power distri-
bution, however, is very diﬀerent for both I1700 and I1600.
For I1700, the power enhancement is weak and conﬁned to
moderate to purely vertical ﬁeld, while for I1600, the en-
hancement is seen only when the ﬁeld is nearly horizontal.
However, it should be noted that the B and γ values that
we have used in this study are photospheric values and do
not represent actual values at AIA observation heights. In
the future, we plan to use observations from Synoptic Op-
tical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) instru-
ment which would yield vector magnetic ﬁeld observations
at chromospheric heights. As demonstrated in Bloomﬁeld
et al. (2007) vector ﬁeld measurements at diﬀerent heights
will also aid to spatially align the pixels between diﬀerent
observables.

We further scrutinize the power distribution as a func-
tion of B and γ by sub-dividing each of them into diﬀerent
groups based on the analysis of Rajaguru et al. (2013a);
(i) three diﬀerent range of inclination angle as a function

the power distribution is shown as a function of γ. The
reduced power band is further noticed for highly inclined
ﬁeld (right panel of Figure 6). We also observe that, at
low frequencies, strong halos occur only for horizontal and
moderately inclined ﬁeld. As the ﬁeld becomes more ver-
tical, the halos shift to higher frequencies.

7 indicate that the pattern of power
panels of Figures 6
halos have changed with height. At about 385 km where
the AIA 1700 ˚A line forms, excess power is seen at low
to moderately B values starting at about 6 mHz. As for
Doppler observations, halos can be seen up to 10 mHz. We
also notice that halos are absent when the ﬁeld is horizon-
tal and as a result the power halos appear as two disjoint
columns in I1700 and I1600 maps. This power distribution
was also observed by Rajaguru et al. (2013a) and has been
termed “twin halos”. As B increases, the twin halos shift
to higher ν and the separation between them increases im-
plying that halos at higher magnetic ﬁeld exist only when
the ﬁeld is vertical. In the case of I1600, the twin halos are
observed for low magnetic ﬁeld (left top panel of Figure 7).
The most accepted mechanism of halo formation re-
lies on the attack angle i.e. the angle between the wave
vector of the incident wave and the orientation of the mag-
netic ﬁeld at the conversion/transmission depth (Schunker
& Cally, 2006). If the attack angle is large, energy could
be transported from the fast-acoustic mode to the fast-
magnetic mode while for small attack angles, the energy
will be mainly channeled into the ﬁeld aligned slow mode.
Thus for Doppler observations near disk center, the attack
angle is large between the velocity and the horizontal mag-
netic ﬁeld and produces strong halos for low to moderate
magnetic ﬁeld only when the ﬁeld is horizontal concurring
with the observations of Schunker & Braun (2011). This
theory also explains the spreading of the halos with height;
since the magnetic canopy where the sound speed equals
the Alfv´en velocity is located at greater heights due to the
spreading of the magnetic ﬁeld.

4. Phase and Coherence Spectrum

The phase diﬀerence and cross-coherence function be-

tween a pair of observables (e.g. 1 and 2) are deﬁned as

δΦ12(ν) = arg(P1(ν) . P

2 (ν)),

(1)

where P1(ν) and P ∗
2 (ν) are the Fourier transforms of the
denote the com-
power spectra of a pair of observables;
plex conjugate and ν is the temporal frequency. We adopt
the convention that positive values of δΦ12 imply that sig-
nal 1 leads signal 2 i.e.
the wave is propagating from
height 1 to 2 and the opposite holds for a negative phase
shift. Here we only consider the spatially averaged phase
diﬀerence given per sampled frequency by

∗

[δΦ12]xy(ν) = arg([P1(ν)]xy . [P

∗
2 (ν)]xy),

(2)

where the square bracket denotes averaging over the spa-
tial direction (Lites et al., 1998; Krijger et al., 2001) . The
degree of coherence between the two signals is expressed
as

C12(ν) =

(3)

where the expectation value is approximated as a running
mean in the frequency interval (Lites et al., 1998) because
without any smoothing the coherence between two sinu-
soidal Fourier components at given spatial and temporal
point is unity regardless of the corresponding Fourier am-
plitude and phase diﬀerence. For pure noise this procedure
yields a positive coherence C = 1/√n where n is the fre-
quency bin used in the averaging procedure. In this analy-
sis we consider N = 21 which yields a frequency smoothing
over 0.357 mHz and a pure noise, C12 = 0.22.

Figure 8 shows the spatially averaged phase diﬀerence
and coherence spectra between Doppler and other observ-
ables. The spatially averaged phase diﬀerence and coher-
ence spectra as a function of the frequency is plotted in one
ﬁgure so that one can correlate the behavior between the
two. For comparison, we also include the phase diﬀerence
and coherence spectra between the two AIA channels.

The ﬁgure illustrates that the coherence is larger be-
tween a pair of quiet regions (blue lines) compared to the
active regions (red lines). Since the active region changes
the properties of the waves either through mode conversion
or through scattering, transmission and absorption (or a
combination of these phenomena), it is expected that the
coherency between the two layers should decrease. The
quiet Sun phase diﬀerence between V -I (panel a) has a
value of about 135◦ in the 5 min band and agrees with
the earlier ﬁndings (Jimenez et al., 1990). We also notice
a diﬀerence between the quiet and active regions; for the
quiet regions we note a positive phase lag at all frequen-
cies, while we ﬁnd a negative phase lag at about 6 mHz
for the active region implying a reﬂected or refracted wave
at higher frequencies. Moreover, the phase diﬀerence for
quiet (active) region slowly decreases (increases) to 0◦ close

to the Nyquist frequency. The coherence between V -I
is high at low frequencies but slowly decreases. Beyond
2.5 mHz, the coherence again increases and attains a peak
value at . 4 mHz before decreasing to the noise level at
high frequency of 10 mHz. It is also interesting to note that
the pattern of phase shifts and coherence beyond 6.5 mHz
is similar to the phase diﬀerence pattern of the active re-
gion.

−

The phase diﬀerence between HMI V and AIA inten-
sities show a sharp peak about 2 mHz, around the upper
limit of the granulation signal. The phase diﬀerence re-
verses its sign about 3 mHz implying a downward propa-
180◦ close to 10 mHz. As discussed
gation and reaches
earlier, the coherence decreases for the active region. Al-
though the coherence spectra between V -I1700 and V -I1600
are similar, we note diﬀerences between the phase infor-
mation in both quiet and active regions. The phase dif-
ference between V -I1600 corresponding to the quiet region
implies a upward propagating wave while for V -I1700, we
note an evanescent wave at higher frequencies. Moreover
90◦
the phase diﬀerence between V -I1600 stabilizes about
implying a transverse wave at the highest frequency. Rijs
et al. (2016) have also compared the phase shifts between
the two AIA intensities with respect to the continuum in-
tensity as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength. The
simulation shows positive phase diﬀerences at higher fre-
quencies.

−

Howe et al. (2012) have also constructed relative phase
and cross-coherence maps (not spatial averages) between
diﬀerent observables and found that their properties are
altered around the active region. Maps of phase-shifts be-
tween I and I1700 have also been investigated by Rajaguru
et al. (2013b). However, a direct comparison between these
results is not feasible since we have focused on spatial av-
erages instead of maps of the entire active region.

4.1. Comparison between AIA 1700 ˚A and 1600 ˚A

The phase diﬀerence between I1700 and I1600 follows
the expected behavior of propagating waves up to about
8 mHz after which it decreases slowly. The same behavior
was earlier seen by Krijger et al. (2001) where the de-
crease of the phase diﬀerence was attributed to acoustic
waves steepening into weak shocks on the way up. This is,
however, not supported in the wave simulation performed
by Fossum & Carlsson (2005). The quiet Sun signals are
coherent up to about 8 mHz and gradually decrease to
lower values. The coherence between the active patches
shows a similar behavior with a sightly smaller magnitude.
At higher frequencies, where the coherency decreases, the
active region has a marginally higher coherence than the
quiet region. The turnover interestingly occurs at the fre-
quency where the phase diﬀerence also begins to decline.

5. Summary

We have used data from HMI and AIA on board SDO
to understand the behavior of acoustic oscillations in the

6

photosphere and low chromosphere. The major motivation
of this work is to examine the spatio-temporal power dis-
tribution as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength, incli-
nation of the ﬁeld and height in the solar atmosphere. We
also focused on the coherence and phase diﬀerence prop-
erties between diﬀerent observables.

We ﬁnd that the strong halos occur at frequencies above
the acoustic cutoﬀ extending up to 10 mHz in both Doppler
and AIA 1700˚A channel for low and moderate magnetic
ﬁeld strength and horizontal ﬁeld providing evidence that
mode conversion is responsible for the formation of the ha-
los. It is also observed that the halos are strong functions
of magnetic ﬁeld and ﬁeld inclination. We also note the
spreading of the halos with height since the magnetic ﬁeld
fans out at greater heights increasing the height where the
sound speed equals the Alfv´en velocity. Although, we ﬁnd
some agreement between the halos formed in numerical
simulation and Doppler observation, we ﬁnd large discrep-
ancy between AIA observation and synthetic AIA data
obtained from the simulation primarily due to complex
nature of the observed active region. We also observe that
the diﬀerences in phase between HMI V and AIA intensi-
ties are negative beyond 5 or 6 mHz reassuring that the re-
ﬂection or refraction of the wave occurs at a certain height
and as a result the wave propagates downward. We, how-
ever, note the B and γ values that we have used in this
study are photospheric values and do not represent actual
values at AIA line formation heights. In future, we plan
to use ﬁeld extrapolation to the observing height or simul-
taneous vector ﬁeld measurements at diﬀerent heights for
a robust conclusion.

Table 1: Properties of the Data Sets in Diﬀerent Observables. The start and end time correspond to the T OBS keyword in the image ﬁle.
For HMI, the keyword reﬂects the peak of the weighting function applied to the constituent images comprising the sequence. For AIA, it is
the center of the time for which the camera shutter is open. The unit of time for HMI data is International Atomic Time (TAI) while the
unit for AIA data is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). See https://www.lmsal.com/sdodocs for more information.
