Abstract 

Augmented  Reality  (AR)  is  a  technology  superimposing  interactional  virtual  objects  onto  a  real 
environment.  Since  the  beginning  of  the  millennium,  AR  technologies  have  shown  rapid  growth,  with 
significant research publications in engineering and science. However, the civil infrastructure community 
has minimally implemented AR technologies to date. One of the challenges that civil engineers face when 
understanding and using AR is the lack of a classification of AR in  the context of capabilities for civil 
infrastructure  applications.  Practitioners  in  civil  infrastructure,  like  most  engineering  fields,  prioritize 
understanding  the  level  of  maturity  of  a  new  technology  before  considering  its  adoption  and  field 
implementation.  This  paper  compares  the  capabilities  of  sixteen  AR  Head-Mounted  Devices  (HMDs) 
available  in  the  market  since  2017,  ranking  them  in  terms  of  performance  for  civil  infrastructure 
implementations. Finally, the authors recommend a development framework for practical AR interfaces 
with civil infrastructure and operations. 

Keywords:  Augmented  Reality  (AR);  Head-Mounted  Devices  (HMDs);  civil  infrastructure;  human

1. Introduction 

Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR) devices are attracting both technology giants and startups 
dedicated to both hardware and user-friendly software tools. According to the analysis of the International 
Data Corporation conducted in November 2019, the global AR/VR market will reach $18.8 billion USD 
in 2020 [1]. AR technologies are now moving from research prototypes to applications in practical projects 
[2], evolving from futuristic visions to engineering tools. Today, AR aims to transform medicine, defense, 
education, and the interaction between humans  and engineering  in design, manufacturing, and product 
management [3]. 

AR displays the real environment enhanced by interactive virtual (computer graphic) objects. AR has 
enabled new opportunities in emergence of large and complex data, contributing with new theories and 
applications [3–5]. The concept of AR has been outlined by Caudell and Mizell in 1990 [6]. The concept 
of  AR  is  often  confused  with  three  other  developments  in  computer  graphics  visualization:  VR, 
Augmented  Virtuality  (AV)  and  Mixed  Reality  (MR).  VR  is  an  artificial  environment  which  is 
experienced through sensory stimuli provided by a computer. VR does not necessarily include interaction 
with the real environment. AV merges real-world objects onto a virtual environment. The main difference 

  1 

 
 
 
between AR and AV is the focus of the major displaying environment. AR enables more opportunities of 
quantification of the external world, higher user interaction and exploration with their nearby environment, 
and wider see-through characteristics [7–15]. In this paper, the authors use AR as an inclusive term that 
enables engineers interact with infrastructure in real environments through virtual interfaces.   

AR  implementations  in  civil  systems  promote  comprehension  of  the  working  context  during 
experiments,  allow  engineers  to  perform  field  tasks  with  awareness  of  both  the  physical  and  synthetic 
environments, reduce heavy workload of conducting damage detection manually, and provide insight of 
the dangers on site [16]. About 50% of today’s AR implementations in civil infrastructure are focused on 
construction. In 2010, Dong and Kamat [17,18] developed the SMART-ARMOR system. SMART is an 
AR authoring language with a standard AR development environment. ARMOR is a mobile computing 
hardware  framework.  The  SMART-ARMOR  system  has  been  tested  with  a  multistory  steel  frame 
example, which is a milestone holistic and applicable outdoor construction application of AR technologies. 
Golparvar-Fard et al. [19–22] applied  the registration method  to solve the discrepancy check problem. 
Since  2009  they  have  provided  a  platform  named  D4AR  that  shows  discrepancy  information  during 
construction.  In  2013  they  updated  their  D4AR  to  the  HD4AR  system  [23],  enabling  applications  of 
camera-equipped mobile devices already available. In 2014, based on the D4AR system, Karsch et al. [24] 
combined a set of AR tools to build a valuable platform, ConstructAide, to monitor construction progress 
with unordered photo collections and 3D building models.   

High-efficiency collaborative visualization and communication among multiple users can be realized 
by applying AR technologies. Tele-communication can provide high-performance guidance for workers. 
Dong et al. [25] developed an AR software, ARVita, for the collaborative visualization of multiple users 
wearing Head-Mounted Devices (HMDs). Using ARVita, all the users can observe and interact with the 
dynamic  visual  simulations  of  the  engineering  processes.  Hammad  et  al.  [26]  developed  a  prototype 
distributed AR visualization collaborative system, DARCC, and tested it in a bridge deck rehabilitation 
project to show the effectiveness. Another significant application is to guarantee site safety by visualizing 
complex workplace situations with AR devices. For example, Kim et al. [27] developed a vision-based 
hazard  avoidance  system  to  provide  safety  information  for  workers.  Fang  et  al.  [28]  deployed  AR 
technologies  to  prevent  workers  operating  at  hazardous  heights.  The  authors  are  also  planning  to 
contribute to the topic of implementing AR HMDs to improve site safety for engineers and workers in a 
future research project.   

In summary, research groups have developed and designed AR prototype devices and applications in 
civil  infrastructure.  However,  these  successful  efforts  are  in  general  designed  for  research  specific 
purposes, and are difficult for civil engineers to implement  in their own projects. Different approaches 
need to be developed in order to increase the growth of AR hardware and software suites across the civil 
engineerin field. For example, the lack of hardware continuity can be a hurdle to AR implementation that 
should  be  considered  in  assessing  utility  of  tools  [29,30].  In  this  context,  Commercial  Off-The-Shelf 
(COTS)  solutions  that  are  robust  enough  to  perform  specialized  tasks  across  multiple  domains  and 
environmental situations. Additionally, COTS solutions should have a diverse enough portfolio to enable 
adoptions by various industry/projects. This viability is critical to any risk adverse industry’s assessment 
of  maturity  and  reliability  via  support  longevity  versus  the  cost  of  integrating  the  technology  into  the 
business model and sustaining the learning curve. 

In the past, researchers have  classified hardware and software capacities of AR devices to increase 
their understanding and implementation by the engineering community. Soto [16] classified and compared 
AR  devices  produced  before  2017,  and  summarized  their  potential  for  implementation.  The  detailed 
comparison of AR devices provided information for civil engineers to apply them in construction. Soto’s 

  2 

 
results showed that AR HMDs can improve users’ visualization for construction steps more effectively 
than hand held devices and other interfaces. Finally, Soto’s study recommended conducting further studies 
to  continue  increasing  the  implementation  of  AR  HMDs  in  civil  infrastructure  projects.  Today,  the 
comparison  from  Soto  in  2017  needs  to  be  expanded  and  increased  since  the  majority  of  today’s  AR 
devices have been produced during the last three years and are not included in Soto’s study. Additionally, 
AR  devices  today  have  more  powerful  sensors,  more  display  pixels  and  faster  processing  units  than 
previous versions. For example, DAQRI, ODG R-9 and Glassup F4 visor were considered advanced in 
2017 by Soto, but today these devices are no longer available.   

This  paper  classifies  AR  technology  capabilities  in  the  context  of  field  implementation  for  civil 
infrastructure projects. First, the authors outline the milestones of AR technology from 1968 to date and 
compare  them  with  the  number  of  publications  on  that  period  of  time.  Then,  the  authors  classify  the 
categories of AR devices that are of higher interest to civil infrastructure applications. This classification 
enables civil infrastructure professionals  to understand the state of the art of today’s AR hardware and 
software.  This  study  compares  the  technical  advantages,  disadvantages  and  limitations  of  sixteen  AR 
HMDs. The authors consider civil infrastructure areas of interest and rank the sixteen AR HMDs in terms 
of their general properties, sensors, computational capabilities, and display capabilities. The result of this 
study is a new classification of AR devices available since 2017 in the context of field implementation.     

2. Chronology of AR milestones 

In the last fifty years, AR research and technology adoption have grown in parallel with the advancements 
of computer science and interfaces between humans, computers and physical systems. Figure 1 shows the 
number  of  publications  since  the  first  AR  application  in  1968  to  date,  and  the  most  significant  AR 
milestones in the same period of time.   

The selection of significant AR milestones  is outlined chronologically to better show the historical 
context of the current state of AR technologies. In 1968, Ivan Sutherland developed a VR HMD with the 
name ‘Sword of Damocles’ to show images comprising virtual environment of simple wireframe rooms 
with head-tracking feature [31]. In 1974, Myron Krueger [32] created a milestone ‘Videoplace’ laboratory 
based on his previous developments of ‘Glowflow’, ‘Metaplay’ and ‘Psychic space’. In the Videoplace 
laboratory, AR displays were designed to surround the users and respond to the movements and actions 
of the users. These remarkable AR platforms were developed before the term ‘Augmented Reality’ was 
formally  coined.  In  1990,  the  term  ‘Augmented  Reality’  was  introduced  formally  for  the  first  time  by 
Caudell  and  Mizell  [6].  In  1992,  Louis  Rosenberg  [33]  developed  ‘Virtual  Fixture’  in  the  USAF 
Armstrong Labs, which was the first functional AR platform enabling people  to control robot arms by 
moving physical arms. In 2000, Kato [34] created an open-source software library ‘ARToolKit’, which 
has been applied in web browsers in 2009, enabling researchers to share and develop AR tools in the same 
platform. On April 15, 2013, Google started to sell a Google Glass prototype in the United States, before 
it became available to the general public on May 15, 2014 [35]. In 2017, Google stopped producing the 
Google Glass prototype for the public and turned to the enterprise edition [36]. Also, Microsoft announced 
their AR prototype in March 2016 named Microsoft HoloLens. Microsoft announced the global expansion 
and  commercialization  of  Microsoft  HoloLens  in  October  2016  [37].  In  addition,  in  2019,  Facebook 
acquired  and  reorganized  Oculus,  becoming  Facebook  Technologies  [38]  and  is  currently  considering 
purchasing ODG [39]. Since then, Facebook has increased their AR technical team [38]. Apple is expected 
to  announce  and  launch  Apple  Glasses  in  2023  [40].  Currently,  Mojo  Vision  is  developing  the  next 
generation AR lens by inputting an AR screen in the medical-grade contact lens instead of glasses [41]. 
However, the publication time for the AR lens has not been announced yet.

Figure 1. Number of AR implementation papers included in Web of Science. 

Figure  1  shows  the  growth  of  AR  publications  since  the  late  1960s  to  date.  The  number  of  AR 
publications started to grow in the late 90s. Since then AR publications increased slowly, transforming in 
2010 to an exponential growth. In 2018, there were 2825 research papers published regarding the topic of 
AR on the Web of Science. Publications in the field of electrical engineering have followed this trend (red 
line in Figure 1), whereas publications in civil infrastructure (green line in Figure 1) have remained low. 
In 2018, 67 articles were published discussing AR applications in civil infrastructure (only 2.4% of the 
total number of AR implementations). In the same year, 546 publications (19.3% of the total) were focused 
on  AR  applications  in  electrical  engineering,  almost  eight  times  higher.  Civil  infrastructure  has  fallen 
behind in both theory and application of AR technologies. It would be valuable to increase interactions 
between humans and infrastructure [4]. Practitioners in civil infrastructure are averse to innovations unless 
the capabilities and success to date is documented and shared by the community. The next section of this 
paper summarizes basic AR advances for potential adopters in the civil infrastructure field who may not 
familiar with computer science in their regular practice.   

3.    Categories of AR devices 

This paper classifies the AR devices that are commercially available since 2017 until February 2020 for 
civil  infrastructure  implementations.  Fully  immersive  VR  headgear  or  video  viewers  are  not  included, 
because the emphasis of this study is the ability of engineers to interact with real environments in the field. 
There are three categories of AR devices based on different display methods, i.e., HMDs, handheld display, 
and spatial display (Figure 2). In this section, the authors analyze the specific contributions and capabilities 
of the three types of AR display methods in terms of their advantages and limitations in the context of 
civil infrastructure implementation.     

HMDs consist of smart glasses displaying virtual images superimposed in front of  the user’s  eyes. 
Based  on  the  number  of  displaying  projectors,  HMDs  can  be  categorized  into  either  Monocular-see-
through or Binocular-see-through. Binocular-see-through is more popular than Monocular-see-through by 
better fitting people’s observational intuition. Some HMDs are designed as a notification system, being 
controlled by a tablet or controller. For example, Toshiba dynaEdge AR100 Smart Glasses is controlled 
by Toshiba dynaEdge DE-100-12U Mobile Mini PC, and Glassup F4 visor is controlled by an external 
controller. Although these devices have a controller PC/tablet, they should still be classified as HMDs. 
HMDs give solutions to initial technical difficulties such as crosstalk of the backside imager [42], scene 
recognition  and  natural  features  tracking  [43–45],  and  close-up  view  coherent  augmentation  [46]. 
Limitations on HMDs include concerns about safety as the user can be isolated from tripping hazards or 
other obstacles in the field [47,48].

Figure 2. Categories of AR devices in terms of display. 

Handheld  displays  are  related  to  AR  applications  developed  for  handheld  devices.  These  displays 
show  virtual  images  on  handheld  computing  devices,  e.g.,  smart  phones,  tablets,  Personal  Digital 
Assistants  (PDAs),  etc.  The  handheld  display  is  typically  represented  by  an  application  with  an  AR 
function, e.g., Morpholio AR Sketchwalk [49], GAMMA AR [50], ViewAR [51], etc. The comparison of 
updated AR applications can be found in the SocialCompare website [52]. The advantages of the handheld 
displays  are  the  increased  awareness  of  the  real  environment  and  confinement  of  virtual  elements  in 
platform that isn’t intended to be in your field of view (FoV) at all times, while the limitations are that 
users’ hands are not available for other activities in the field, compromising their safety [47,48].   

As an alternative to HMDs and handheld devices, spatial display devices show virtual images directly 
in the environment. The advantages of spatial display are that the safety of users is not undermined by the 
AR display and multiple observers can utilize a single set of hardware, as opposed to everyone using one 
dedicated device per person, either in their hands or on their heads. Lightform Company, founded in 2014, 
develops high-resolution AR projections that track objects and respond to human inputs in real-time [53]. 
Their first and second generation products, LF1 and LF2 were presented in February and November of 
2019, respectively. However, the lack of portability of spatial devices limits their applications in the field 
of  assessment  and  inspection  of  large  infrastructure  sites.  In  addition,  the  complexity  of  augmented 
elements is typically more confined to 2D overlays that require existing structure present.   

  5 

 
 
In  conclusion,  HMDs  are  the  most  commonly  implemented  display  method  for  professional 
applications. Most AR devices in the market today are HMDs, but the unclassified complex information 
has limited the mass adoption by civil engineers. In the following section, the authors analyze and compare 
sixteen  AR  HMDs  in  the  last  three  years  in  the  context  of  potential  for  civil  infrastructure  field 
implementation.   

4. Comparison of AR HMDs 

The foundation of AR implementation is the theoretical development of AR technologies. Most devices 
today are in the experiment and prototype phase, and have not been implemented in real site constructions. 
Before 2017, the main difficulties of adopting AR technologies in civil infrastructure have been the high 
expense and the immaturity of devices [54]. With the rapid development of AR devices in recent years, 
commercially  available  AR  HMDs  with  reasonable  weight  and  price  have  been  developed  for  civil 
infrastructure. Although a perfect final theoretical solution to the AR implementation is still in the distant 
future, AR HMDs are using alternatives to meet the engineering demands. As compared in Tables 1-4, a 
suitable  AR  HMD  should  be  selected  by  first  considering  performance  requirements  for  different 
engineering scenarios, then choosing along the price/weight line in Figure 5. For example, the RealWear 
HMT-1Z1 should be selected for high-risk (e.g., potentially explosive sites) and high-value construction 
for its product durability and high price; the Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 is more suitable for daily 
use because of its light weight and ergonomic design.   

4.1. General properties   

Table 1 summarizes the general capabilities of AR HMDs, sorted by released date from #1 (most recent, 
February 2020) to #16 (January 2017). AR HMDs #1 and #16 are Vuzix M400 Version 1.1.4 and DAQRI 
Smart Glasses, respectively. AR HMDs #14-16 are no longer available for purchase: Glassup F4 visor, 
ODG R-9 and DAQRI, respectively. Out of the total sixteen AR HMDs, eleven are developed by United 
States companies (69%), and three are produced by two Japanese companies (19%): Toshiba and Epson. 

According  to  Golparvar-Fard  et  al.  [55],  product  durability  is  among  the  first  considerations  when 
selecting AR devices for engineering applications. Table 1 shows four indexes for product durability (5th-
8th  columns):  water  resistance,  working  temperature  range,  working  humidity  range,  and  drop  safe 
distance. According to these four columns of Table 1, the Vuzix M400 Version 1.1.4 and RealWear HMT-
1/1Z1 are the two AR HMDs with highest product durability.   

The 9th and 10th columns of Table 1 list weight and price for each AR HMD, respectively. Figure 3 
shows the weight distribution of AR HMDs from 2017 until today, with a median weight value of 218g 
per  device.  The  median  value  is  used  to  avoid  the  influence  of  devices  with  excessive  weight  such  as 
HMT-1Z1, DAQRI and Microsoft HoloLens 2. According to Figure 3, the distribution of weight of AR 
HMDs  does  not  follow  a  chronological  trend.  Weight  limits  should  be  considered  when  selecting  AR 
HMDs in the field. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z89.1-1969 regulates the maximum 
weight limit for safety hard hats used in civil infrastructure industry [56]. According to ANSI, Class A 
and C hard hats have a maximum recommended weight of 425g, and Class D hard hats has a maximum 
recommended weight of 850g. AR HMDs should follow the ANSI regulation regarding maximum weight 
limit in the civil infrastructure industry. The majority of the AR HMDs shown in Figure 3 weight less than 
the limit of Class A/C hard hats. The weight of HMT-1Z1 and Microsoft HoloLens 2 are beyond the limit 
of Class A/C hard hats, but still under the limit of Class D hard hats. It can be concluded that the majority 
of  AR  HMDs  are  in  general  available  for  implementation  in  the  field  of  civil  infrastructure,  although 
according to experts other specific field requirements besides weight such as safety and comfort still need 
to be considered [56].

Figure 3. Chronological trend of AR HMDs weight (01/2017-02/2020). 

Figure 4 shows the price distribution of the AR HMDs. According to this analysis, the median price 
value per device is $1975. As in the case of weight, the change of AR HMDs cost between 2017 and 2020 
does not follow an evident chronological trend. 

Figure 4. Chronological trend of AR HMDs price (01/2017-02/2020). 

Figure 5 shows the price distribution of the AR HMDs versus weight. With  the  exception of  three 
devices (Toshiba AR100, DAQRI and HMT-1Z1), the other thirteen AR HMDs follow a linear correlation 
between price and weight with a regression index r=0.91. This linear correlation is of interest to potential 
adopters of AR HMDs to understand available product capabilities and  limitations in weight and  cost. 
HMT-1Z1 and DAQRI are the two most expensive AR HMDs: HMT-1Z1, priced at $6000, is developed 
by RealWear, a startup company founded in 2015, and it is the only AR HMD especially developed for 
an  outdoor  environment.  DAQRI  is  one  of  the  earliest  AR  HMD  trials  and  is  no  longer  available  for 
purchase. According to past research, heavier AR HMDs are generally attributed to larger processing units 
and  sophisticated  add-on  hardware,  which  enable  more  advanced  user  experiences  and  better 
performances [57]. In addition, this mass can play into durability and thermal management of the hardware 
to survive more extreme environments. After AR HMDs are established as products of widespread interest 
to engineers, they  are  expected  to decrease price and weight while increasing  their performance.  Civil 
engineers and other infrastructure industries can actively participate in the direction of development of 
AR HMDs and technologies.

4.2. Sensors 

Table 2 summarizes the sensors built in AR HMDs, sorted by the number of pixels on its camera sensor. 
The 3rd column in Table 2 summarizes the pixels of cameras of the sixteen devices. AR HMDs with more 
pixels can capture more accurate images. HMT-1/1Z1 from RealWear has the most advanced cameras of 
16Mp, with good accuracy for infrastructure inspections and data acquisition.   

Tracking characteristics include head tracking and eye tracking, as shown in the 4th and 5th column of 
Table 2, respectively. Head-tracking is a necessity for AR HMDs to properly align the rendering of virtual 
objects onto real environments [58]. Therefore, all the AR HMDs available for purchase today include the 
function the head-tracking. Eye tracking enables AR HMDs to capture the eye position and improve the 
occlusion  accuracy of virtual objects  [59]. The ThirdEye  Gen X2, Vuzix M400 Version 1.1.4,  Google 
Glass Enterprise Edition 2, Microsoft HoloLens 2, and Magic Leap 1 include the eye tracking function. 
HMDs’ ability to precisely depict the real environment depends on the mapping capacity enabled by depth 
sensors. In the devices with eye tracking function,  only ThirdEye  Gen X2, Microsoft HoloLens 2, and 
Magic Leap 1 are developed with depth sensors. Gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer and locating 
sensors  enable  the  HMDs  to  be  implemented  in  outdoor  environments.  Microsoft  HoloLens  2  is  a 
functional device for indoor environments due to the lack of locating sensors. 

4.3. Computational capacities 

One  of  the  major  challenges  of  AR  implementation  is  the  synchronization  problem,  i.e.,  time  delay 
problem. The images in the real environment are captured by the users’ eyes immediately, but the images 
in the virtual environment have to be processed before displayed in front of eyes. The time delay caused 
by the processing of the virtual objects can lead to a displacement between the real and virtual environment 
[60]. For the optical see-through HMDs, the synchronization cannot be thoroughly eliminated, but can be 
minimized by accelerating the virtual objects processing and improving computational capacities.   

Table  3  summarizes  the  computational  and  connectivity  capacities  of  AR  HMDs,  sorted  by  the 
Random Access Memory (RAM) and hardware storage, listed in the 4th and 5th columns, respectively. For 
professional work, 16GB RAM is ideal, and 4GB is an entry-level memory to produce applicable software. 
The processing unit determines the computational capacity of a device, as listed in the 3rd column of Table 
3. The two devices developed by Kopin, Golden-i Infinity Smart Screen and Solos Smart Glasses, and the 
AR projector, Lightform LF2, use the processor and internal storage of the host device (computer or smart 

  8 

 
 
phone). Except for the Kopin and Lightform products, over half of the AR HMDs are developed with a 
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. Intel cores are the second-most popular processors.   

The 6th-8th column of Table 3 list the connectivity capacities of the AR HMDs. Universal data transfer 
modes include WiFi, Bluetooth and USB. Nearly all the devices are designed to have all the three universal 
data transfer ports. Battery life is another important index for AR HMDs, measured by the interval between 
two  full  charges.  Nevertheless,  besides  the  battery  life,  continuous  work  time  also  depends  on  the  use 
intensity and therefore can’t be simply measured. Comparatively, Microsoft HoloLens 2 has the maximum 
battery  capacity,  but  Everysight  Raptor  and  Kopin  Solos  Smart  Glasses  have  longer  active  use  time 
because of their relatively power saving design.   

4.4. Displays 

Table 4 summarizes the display capacities of the AR HMDs, sorted by the FoV which is listed in the 3rd 
column. FoV is an index describing the open see-through angle of an optical device. A larger FoV provides 
engineers a broader observable environment. In Table 4, FoV is represented by the diagonal see-through 
angle. The 5th column of Table 4 lists the resolution of AR HMDs, defined as the number of distinct pixels 
that can be displayed in each dimension. The 6th column of Table 4 compares the refreshing rate, defined 
as the number of display images a device can update per second. A trade-off exists between the resolution 
and the refresh rate [61]. A higher resolution enhances display quality, while a higher refresh rate improves 
video fluency [62]. Both Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 and Kopin Solos compromise resolution to 
ensure  a  refresh  rate  of  120  Hz,  while  the  Everysight  Raptor  and  the  Magic  Leap  1  have  a  decreased 
refresh rate to fulfil the 1080p resolution.   

4.5. Summary 

This section provides a systematic classification of available AR HMDs regarding to parameters of interest 
to civil engineers. Table 1 compares the weight, price and product durability of sixteen AR HMDs. The 
lightest three AR HMDs are Kopin Golden-i, Toshiba AR100 and Kopin Solos. The least expensive three 
AR HMDs are Kopin Solos, Everysight Raptor and Kopin Golden-i. HMT-1Z1 has the greatest product 
durability. Table 2 compares the sensors of the AR HMDs. According to this table, HMT-1/1Z1 have the 
largest camera resolution. Table 3 compares the computational capabilities of the AR HMDs. Magic Leap 
1, ODG R-9 and Vuzix M400 Version 1.1.4 have the largest RAM and storage.  Table 4 compares the 
display capabilities of the AR HMDs. Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2, Everysight Raptor and Microsoft 
HoloLens  2  have  the  largest  FoV.  Everysight  Raptor,  Magic  Leap  1  and  ODF  R-9  have  the  largest 
resolution. Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2, Microsoft HoloLens 2 and Kopin Solos have the largest 
refresh  rate.  The  classification  and  ranking  of  the  capabilities  in  these  four  tables  are  focused  on 
implementations for civil infrastructure applications, but are not exhaustive and other areas can be added 
in the future.  This classification is however  a first step to enable the civil infrastructure  community  to 
choose  AR  devices  highly  ranked  in  the  areas  of  interest  for  their  specific  implementations.  This 
classification is also a comparative list of options where they can better understand the tradeoff of their 
selection. The four tables enable civil infrastructure potential adopters a simple to read list of technical 
capabilities related to civil infrastructure applications.

5. Conclusions 

The authors classify sixteen AR HMDs available in the market since 2017 in terms of capabilities for civil 
infrastructure implementation. This paper compares AR HMDs performance in the areas of weight, price, 
product durability, sensors, connectivity, computational capacities and display capacities. Comparatively, 
each AR HMD has its own advantages. The weight of most AR HMDs is under the maximum limit of 
safety hard hats generally used in civil infrastructure projects. Civil engineers are interested in parameters 
such as camera resolution, processing unit and FoV, which are related to quality of information, processing 
speed, and working safety scenarios, respectively. According to the classification and ranking of this study, 
Google  Glass  Enterprise  Edition  2,  Microsoft  HoloLens  2  and  Everysight  Raptor  have  the  highest 
combined  capabilities  to  become  popular  AR  HMDs  for  civil  infrastructure.  Google  Glass  Enterprise 
Edition 2 has the largest FoV, which is essential in constructions, and Everysight Raptor has the second 
largest  FoV  and  second  largest  camera  resolution.  Additionally,  Microsoft  HoloLens  2  has  all-sided 
sensors  (including  depth  sensor),  high-resolution  display,  third  largest  FoV  and  relatively  balanced 
calculation and storage performances. Microsoft HoloLens 2 is capable of 3D monitoring and has a user-
friendly cross-platform toolkit for AR application (MRTK) that engineers can implement directly. 

      According to the current state of the art of AR HMDs in civil infrastructure, three major developments 
are necessary to widen their implementation in real applications: 1) technical advancements that address 
theoretical problems for AR users, e.g., occlusion and synchronization problems; 2) reduction of weight 
and price of AR HMDs along with improved performance; and 3) a unified AR platform and a benchmark 
model designed specifically for civil infrastructure, so that AR applications and devices available today 
can be compared and combined.
