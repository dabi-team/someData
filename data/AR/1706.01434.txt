Understanding the dynamics of positron cool-
ing in gases, including the fraction of positrons
surviving to thermalisation, is critical for accu-
rate interpretation of positron lifetime spectra,
for the development of eﬃcient positron cooling
in traps and accumulators, and for a cryogeni-
cally cooled, ultra-high-energy-resolution, trap-
based positron beam. Here, positron cooling
and annihilation in noble gases is simulated us-
ing accurate scattering and annihilation cross sec-
tions calculated ab initio with many-body the-
ory. It is shown that a strikingly small fraction
of positrons survive to thermalisation: ∼0.1 in
He, ∼0 in Ne (due to cooling eﬀectively stalling
in the relatively deep momentum-transfer cross-
section minimum), ∼0.15 in Ar, ∼0.05 in Kr and
∼0.01 in Xe. For Xe, the time-varying annihila-
tion rate ¯Zeﬀ (τ ) is shown to be highly sensitive to
the depletion of the distribution due to annihi-
lation, conclusively explaining the long-standing
discrepancy between gas-cell and trap-based mea-
surements. The ab initio calculations enable the
ﬁrst simultaneous probing of the energy depen-
dence of the scattering cross section and annihila-
tion rate. Overall, the use of the accurate atomic
data gives ¯Zeﬀ (τ ) in close agreement with exper-
iment for all noble gases except Ne, the experi-
ment for which is proﬀered to have suﬀered from
incomplete knowledge of the fraction of positrons
surviving to thermalisation and/or the presence
of impurities.

Observation of lifetime spectra for positrons annihilat-
ing in gases was one of the ﬁrst sources of information on
positron interaction with atoms and molecules (see e.g.,
[1–4] and [5, 6] for reviews). In particular, measurements
of the time-varying normalised annihilation rate ¯Zeﬀ (t)
during positron thermalisation provided information on
the energy dependence of the scattering and annihilation
cross sections. Understanding the dynamics of positron
cooling, including the fraction of positrons surviving to
thermalisation, is critical for accurate interpretation of
the positron lifetime experiments. Incomplete thermal-
isation was suspected to be responsible for the lack of
consensus among the ¯Zeﬀ data in Xe [7], while modelling
of ¯Zeﬀ (t) [8, 9] revealed deﬁciencies in the theoretical data
for neon and the heavier noble-gas atoms. Understand-
ing of positron kinetics is also crucial for the development
of eﬃcient positron cooling in traps and accumulators

[10], and for a cryogenically cooled, ultra-high-energy-
resolution, trap-based positron beam [11, 12].

Despite the importance of

long-standing positron-
cooling experimental results [5, 6], there has been a
paucity of theoretical studies of positron cooling in gases.
Previous studies have mainly employed the diﬀusion or
Fokker-Planck (FP) equation [8, 9, 13–16]. They used
semi-empirical or model cross sections, e.g., calculated
in the polarised-orbital approximation [17–21], yielding
limited success in describing the experiments.

Recently, many-body theory (MBT) was used to
provide an accurate and essentially complete descrip-
tion of low-energy positron interactions with noble-gas
atoms, taking full account, ab initio, of the strong
positron-atom and electron-positron correlations, includ-
ing virtual-positronium formation [22–25]. It yielded ex-
cellent agreement between theory and experiment for the
scattering cross sections, annihilation rates [24, 25], and
γ-spectra [25], ﬁrmly establishing the relative contribu-
tions of annihilation on various atomic orbitals. It has
also been successfully applied to positron scattering and
annihilation on hydrogenlike ions [26] and to study the
eﬀect of positron-atom correlations on positron molecule
γ spectra [27, 28].

Here, we show that the MBT data enables accu-
rate modeling of positron cooling and annihilation in
noble gases. Using the MBT data in Monte-Carlo
(MC) simulations [29, 30], we calculate the time-evolving
positron momentum distribution f (k, τ ) [we work in
units where τ is the time (in ns) scaled by the num-
ber density of the gas ng (in amagat): τ = ngt] and
from this the time-varying annihilation rate ¯Zeﬀ (τ ) =
(cid:82) Zeﬀ (k)f (k, τ )dk/ (cid:82) f (k, τ )dk, which can be compared
with experiments. The fraction of positrons surviving to
thermalisation is shown to be strikingly small. ¯Zeﬀ (τ ) is
shown to be sensitive to the amount of particles annihi-
lating before thermalisation, conclusively explaining the
long-standing discrepancy between the gas-cell and trap-
based ¯Zeﬀ results in Xe. Importantly, the approach en-
ables the simultaneous probing of the energy dependence
of the cross section and Zeﬀ . Overall, the MBT-based
MC calculations give the best agreement with experiment
for all the noble gases to date.

RESULTS

Examination of the key physical quantities
governing positron cooling and annihilation

At energies below the positronium-formation thresh-
old, energy loss in atomic gases proceeds only via elastic
collisions through momentum transfer. The process of
positron thermalisation in a Maxwellian gas of tempera-
ture T is governed by the mean squared change in mo-
mentum per unit time (cid:104)∆k2/δτ (cid:105) = 2B(k), where B(k) ≡
kσt(k)kBT m/M [31], k and m are the positron momen-
tum and mass, M is the mass of the gas atom and σt is
the positron-atom momentum-transfer cross section. It is
calculated as σt = 4πk−2 (cid:80)∞
(cid:96)=0((cid:96) + 1) sin2(δ(cid:96) − δ(cid:96)+1) [32],
where δ(cid:96)(k) is the scattering phase shift for a positron of
angular momentum (cid:96). Figure 1 shows B(k) for He–Xe,
calculated using phase shifts for (cid:96)=0, 1 and 2 from MBT
[24], with (cid:96) > 2 partial waves described by the leading
k2 term in the expansion [33].
(Higher-order terms in
the phaseshifts for (cid:96) > 2 [34] contribute negligibly to σt,
e.g., < 3% in Xe at the Ps-formation threshold, quickly
reducing to < 1% at k < 0.55 a.u., and can thus be ne-
glected.) B(k) exhibits a minimum for all atoms in the
sequence He–Xe, which becomes less pronounced as one
moves through the sequence (with the exception of Ne,
which has the deepest minimum). As we will see, this
leads to “trapping” of positrons and slowing down of the
cooling process in this momentum range.

The annihilation cross section in many-electron targets
of number density ng is parametrised as σa = πr2
0Zeﬀ c/vr
[35, 36], where r0 is the classical electron radius, c is the
speed of light, vr is the positron speed relative to the
target, and Zeﬀ is the dimensionless eﬀective number of
electrons that contribute to the annihilation process. It
is deﬁned as Zeﬀ = λ/(πr2
0cng) where λ is the true an-
nihilation rate and πr2
0c is the free electron-positron an-

nihilation rate. Positron-atom and positron-electron cor-
relations can result in Zeﬀ being greater than the actual
number of valence electrons on which positrons predomi-
nantly annihilate [20–24]. Zeﬀ (k) has been calculated re-
cently for the noble gases via diagrammatic MBT for s, p
and d-wave positrons, taking full account of correlations
[24]. The s, p and d-waves provide suﬃcient accuracy to
model positron cooling below the Ps-formation thresh-
old: although the contribution of f-wave positrons to the
total annihilation rate is expected to be ∼ 10% near the
Ps-formation threshold for Xe, we will see that annihi-
lation is unimportant until the positrons have cooled to
close to the minimum in B(k), at which point the f-wave
contribution is expected to be negligible (∼ 1%: we note
that Zeﬀ (k) ∼ k2(cid:96) as as k → 0 [24]). From He to Xe, Zeﬀ
becomes increasingly large and strongly peaked at low
momenta (see Fig. 2, calculated including annihilation
on core and valence electrons). This eﬀect is due to the
existence of positron-atom virtual levels [37], signiﬁed by
large scattering lengths for Ar, Kr and Xe (see Table I in
[24]).

Simulations of positron cooling and annihilation

The time-evolving momentum distribution f (k, τ ) for
positrons cooling and annihilating in a noble gase is de-
termined via Monte-Carlo simulations based on the MBT
scattering and annihilation cross sections (see ‘Methods’
for details on the Monte-Carlo algorithm). Figure 3
is an example of f (k, τ ), calculated for Ar for 50,000
positrons initially distributed uniformly in energy up to
positronium-formation threshold.
[Also see Supplemen-
tal Material for corresponding videos [38] of the evolu-
tion of f (k, τ ) for of all the noble gases.] The initial
distribution is seen to quickly evolve (<∼100 ns amg) to
a strong Gaussian-like peak near the minimum in B(k),

tum kth =

√

kmin ∼ 0.3 a.u, which then evolves rather slowly, pro-
ducing the knee-like feature in the ﬁgure. This bunch-
ing eﬀect becomes less eﬀective as one moves through
the sequence from He to Xe since the minimum in B(k)
becomes less pronounced (with the exception of Neon,
which has the deepest minimum). However, even in Xe
the formation of a peak in f (k, τ ) at kmin ∼ 0.25 a.u. at
small time-densities is still evident. Since for any real-
istic initial distribution most positrons will have initial
momenta k > kmin, such bunching should be expected,
making the overall cooling times somewhat insensitive
to the exact form of the initial distribution (see below
for further details). The small number of positrons with
initial momenta below the minimum at early times cool
to thermal energies relatively unimpeded, and they form
a second, much smaller peak around thermal momen-
tum kth ∼
3kBT ∼ 0.0528 a.u. As the time-density
increases, the Gaussian-like part of the distribution tra-
verses the minimum, roughly maintaining its form as it
does so. As more positrons cool below the minimum, the
two peaks in the distribution merge, eventually evolving
towards the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

√

As seen in Fig. 3, only a small fraction of positrons
survive before the distribution thermalizes at τ ∼ 400
ns amagat. This fraction is even smaller in other noble
gases (see Fig. 3), which has important consequences for
the interpretation of measured lifetime spectra (see be-
low). We deﬁne the ‘complete’ thermalisation time τth
as the time-density at which the r.m.s. momentum of the

distribution is within 1% of kth ∼
3kBT , the r.m.s. for
a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 293 K. The values
of τth are marked in Fig. 4, and are presented in Ta-
ble I, alongside the fractions of initial positrons remain-
ing at that time-density F (τth). This fraction is a mere
F (τth) = 0.11 for helium, and reduces by more than an
order of magnitude for xenon. Perhaps most remarkably,
the fraction of positrons surviving to thermalisation in Ne
is zero. In neon, cooling eﬀectively stalls at the minimum
of B(k) (see Fig. 1), with positrons eventually succumb-
ing to annihilation (in spite of a relatively small Zeﬀ ∼ 6)
before they can cool further.

Comparison with experiment: time-varying
annihilation rate parameter ¯Zeﬀ .

Figure 5 shows ¯Zeﬀ (τ ) for He, Ar, Kr and Xe, obtained
in the calculations that excluded or included particle loss
due to annihilation, for positrons initially distributed uni-
formly in energy, and with initial energy equal to the
positronium-formation threshold. The latter distribution
is unphysical, but provides an upper limit on the cool-
ing time. For all the noble gases the increase in Zeﬀ (k)
as k → 0 results in the evolution of ¯Zeﬀ (τ ) through
a transient ‘shoulder’ region resulting from epithermal
annihilation at k < kmin [1–3] towards its steady-state
thermal value ¯Zeﬀ ≡ (cid:82) ∞
0 Zeﬀ (k)fT (k)dk, where fT (k) is
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution taken at T = 293
K. Comparisons between theory and experiment are fo-
cussed around the shoulder, which is somewhat insensi-
tive to the initial distribution of the positrons [5, 29] as
a result of the bunching around the minimum in B(k).

Coleman et al. [4] (red circles) and FP calculation of Campeanu and Humberston [14] (blue dashed-dotted lines). Arrows mark
the calculated (black) and experimental shoulder lengths (red) τs.

The traditional measure of the thermalisation time in
positron-gas studies is the ‘shoulder length’ τs, deﬁned
via ¯Zeﬀ (τs) ≡ ¯Zeﬀ − 0.1∆ ¯Z where ∆ ¯Z = ¯Zeﬀ − ¯Zmin,
and ¯Zmin is the minimum of ¯Zeﬀ (τ ) [39]. The calculated
τs are given in Table I along with experimental and pre-
vious theoretical results. As noted by Al Qaradawi et
al. [10], and by Paul and Leung [39], systematic errors in
experiments may outweigh statistical uncertainties in de-
termining τs, and the experimental shoulder lengths may
be expected to have uncertainties ∼ 10%. We now con-
sider the results for each atom in turn, postponing the
discussion of Ne as it is atypical.

Helium:–The calculated Zeﬀ (τ ) is seen to be insensi-
tive to both the initial distribution and whether deple-

tion of the distribution is included or not. It is known
that the MBT slightly underestimates the thermal ¯Zeﬀ
in He, predicting a value of ¯Zeﬀ =3.79 compared with
the experimental value of 3.94 [4]. Scaling the calcu-
lated Zeﬀ (τ ) to the long-time steady-state experimen-
tal value, we ﬁnd excellent agreement with experiment
around the shoulder region, with the calculated shoulder
length τs = 1839 ns amg agreeing to within 5% of the
experimental value of τs = 1700 ± 50 ns amg. The overall
shape and length of the calculated shoulder are in bet-
ter agreement with experiment than the FP calculation
of Campeanu and Humberston [14], who used the cross
sections from their Kohn variational calculations. The

also shown. It relied on a carefully tuned model polar-
isation potential and zeroth-order Zeﬀ (k) scaled by en-
hancement factors, and produced τs = 1618 ns amagat.
Overall, there is good agreement between the present cal-
culation, that of Boyle et al. and experiment. This com-
plements the excellent agreement between the MBT and
variational calculations, and measurements of the elastic
scattering cross sections [24].

Argon:–The present calculated Zeﬀ (τ ) are sensitive to
the initial distribution at small times, but the overall
cooling times for both distributions are similar. The
result is weakly sensitive to whether depletion of the
distribution is included or not. The calculated thermal
¯Zeﬀ = 26.0 is in close to the value of 26.77 measured by
Coleman et al. [4]. The calculated shoulder time τs = 369
ns amg is in excellent agreement with the measured value
of 362±5 ns amg [4], with reasonable overall agreement
in the shape of the shoulder. A much smaller shoul-
der length was measured in the Al Qaradawi experiment,
which was suspected to have suﬀered from the presence
of impurities [10]. The present calculations show bet-
ter agreement with experiment than the FP calculation
of Campeanu [8], which used the polarised-orbital cross
section [20].

Krypton:–The calculated shoulder length and ¯Zeﬀ are
in excellent agreement with experiment of Wright et
al. [7] (ﬂuctuations at long times are a result of the small
number of positrons remaining). The FP calculation of
Campeanu [9], which used the polarised-orbital cross sec-
tions [21], underestimates ¯Zeﬀ .

Xenon:–The case of Xe is special, because of the strong

peaking of ¯Zeﬀ at small k, which means that annihilation
successfully competes with cooling at epithermal positron
momenta. When positron depletion due to annihilation
is neglected, the positron cooling is fast (τs ∼ 150 ns
amg), and Zeﬀ plateaus at ∼ 450. Including depletion
brings the shoulder region and shoulder length into ex-
cellent agreement with experiment [7] (ﬂuctuations are
the result of the small fraction of particles remaining).
The FP calculation of Campeanu is in serious disagree-
ment with experiment and the MBT result. It used the
polarised-orbital cross sections of McEachran et al. [21],
which predict elastic scattering cross sections and Zeﬀ (k)
that are smaller than the MBT calculation and experi-
ment [24].

The present calculations show that ¯Zeﬀ is highly sensi-
tive to the loss of particles due to annihilation. The vig-
orous increase in Zeﬀ (k) as k → 0 leads to a quasi-steady-
state long-time distribution whose low-momentum com-
ponent is found to be suppressed relative to the Maxwell-
Boltzmann one, and a steady-state annihilation rate
Zeﬀ (τ → ∞) ∼ 350 that is signiﬁcantly reduced from the
calculated true thermal ¯Zeﬀ ∼ 450. The present results
thus conclusively explain the discrepancy between the
gas-cell measurement of ¯Zeﬀ ∼ 320 of Wright et al. [7],
and the Penning-Malmberg trap measurement ¯Zeﬀ ∼ 401
of the Surko group [40], whose setup ensures positrons
are well thermalised. We remark that by adding small
amounts of a lighter, low-Zeﬀ gas, e.g., He or H2, to
Xe, Wright et al. measured an increase of the pure Xe
¯Zeﬀ ∼ 320 to ¯Zeﬀ = 400–450 [7], which is broadly con-
sistent with the present calculated value and the Surko

with an admixture of He is, however, unclear, given that
momentum transfer is more eﬀective in Xe as k → 0 (see
Fig. 1).

Neon:–Figure 6 shows Zeﬀ (τ ) for Ne. The calculated
shoulder time (in this case calculated excluding loss of
particles due to annihilation) is τs = 12, 000 ns amg, by
which time the fraction of positrons remaining is prac-
tically zero.
It is drastically longer than the measured
value τ = 2700 ns amg [4] (note that the FP calcula-
tion of Campeanu is also slower and has not reached a
steady state value). This serious disagreement is in spite
of the good agreement of the MBT elastic scattering cross
section with experiment, including at the Ramsauer min-
imum [24]. Moreover, the present calculation is consis-
tent with that expected from mass scaling the He result

The experimental shoulder length was determined by
Coleman et al. [4] via straight line ﬁts to the lifetime spec-
trum. However, in spite of the serious discrepancy in τs,

6

the calculated and measured lifetime spectra are in sur-
prisingly good agreement [see Fig. 5 (b)]. Importantly,
the calculated τs = 12, 000 ns amg and τth ∼ 21, 000
ns amg are much longer than the 0–8000 ns amg con-
sidered in the experimental analysis. As seen in Fig. 4,
at τ <∼ 8000 ns amg the vast majority of positrons have
already annihilated, after cooling had eﬀectively stalled
around the minimum in B(k). Since the Zeﬀ (k) is a rea-
sonably ﬂat function around the minimum, a signal of
many to all of the positrons annihilating at a momenta
close to the minimum would be observed as a levelling
oﬀ of ¯Zeﬀ (τ ), i.e., a characteristic cooling rate measured
over a long time in the lifetime spectra, which could have
erroneously been interpreted as the true thermal ¯Zeﬀ . A
second possible source of error in the experimental mea-
surement is that it was aﬀected by the presence of im-
purities. It is known that positron cooling in gases like
CO2 and N2O is fast, on a time scale of ∼0.1 ns amagat
[10]. The presence of even minute amounts of impurities
could thus lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in the cooling
time.

DISCUSSION

Positron cooling noble gases has been studied using
Monte-Carlo simulations based on accurate cross sections
calculated ab initio from many-body theory. The frac-
tion of positrons surviving annihilation to thermalisation
has been shown to be strikingly small. For Xe, the time-
varying dimensionless annihilation rate ¯Zeﬀ (τ ) is shown
to be strongly aﬀected by the depletion of positrons due
to annihilation. The vigorous increase of the positron
annihilation rate as k → 0 gives rise to a quasi-steady-
state distribution whose low-momentum component is
suppressed relative to the Maxwell-Boltzman one. This
suppression leads to a reduction in the steady-state ¯Zeﬀ ,
conclusively explaining the long-standing discrepancy be-
tween the gas cell and trap-based measurements of ¯Zeﬀ .
Importantly, the current approach has enabled the simul-
taneous probing of the energy dependence of the scatter-
ing cross sections and annihilation rates. Overall, the
use of the accurate MBT data gives the best agreement
to date with experiment for all noble gases except Ne,
the experiment for which is proﬀered to have suﬀered
from incomplete knowledge of the fraction of positrons
surviving to thermalisation and/or the presence of im-
purities. New experiments of positron cooling in neon
are now warranted. Such experiments may include com-
plementary measurements of the time-varying γ spectra
during cooling, which have been shown to be sensitive to
the positron cooling times [41].

METHODS

Monte-Carlo simulation of positron cooling and
annihilation

The momentum k(τi) of an individual positron is de-
termined over an equidistant grid in time-density {τi}
with step size ∆τ as follows. The velocity of a gas par-
ticle is sampled from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu-
tion at 293 K. Both it and the positron velocities are
transformed to the centre-of-mass frame, in which the
energy available for the collision is ECM = µv2
r /2, where
µ is the reduced mass and vr is the relative speed of the
positron and gas particle. A uniformly distributed ran-
dom number r1 = U [0, 1], is drawn, and a collision is
deemed to occur if r1 < P = W ∆τ , where W = ngvrσtot
is the probability rate of annihilation or elastic colli-
sion, with σtot = (σel + σa), subject to the require-
ment that P = W ∆τ (cid:28) 1 (in practice we demand that
P = W ∆t < 0.1). Here σel is the elastic scattering cross
section, which is determined as the integral of the diﬀer-
ential elastic cross section (cid:37) = dσ/dΩ = |f (θ)|2, where
f (θ) is the scattering amplitude. The scattering ampli-
tude is calculated from the MBT calculated phase shifts
for positron angular momenta up to (cid:96) =0, 1 and 2, with
all (cid:96) > 2 approximated using the leading k2 term in the
expansion [33] [see Sec. III D of [24] for details, speciﬁ-
cally Eqn. (31)]. (It has been veriﬁed in the present work
that higher-order corrections [34] lead to < 3% change
in σt at the highest positron momentum in Xe).
If a
collision occurs, a second random number r2 = U [0, 1] is
drawn. If r2 < σa/σtot the event is deemed to be anni-
hilation and the particle is removed from the simulation,
otherwise it is an elastic collision and the positron veloc-
ity is updated as follows. The scattering angle θ is sam-
pled from the diﬀerential cross section by ﬁnding the root
(cid:82) θ
of r3 = 2πσ−1
0 (cid:37) sin θ(cid:48)dθ(cid:48). where r3 = U [0, 1]. In the
el
centre-of-mass frame elastic scattering is symmetric with
respect to the azimuthal angle φ, which is thus chosen
randomly. The momentum distribution f (k, τ ) results
from binning positron momenta at each τi.
