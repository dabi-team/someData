ABSTRACT

We study here the phenomena of decayless kink oscillations in a system of active region (AR) coronal loops. Using high resolution ob-
servations from two different instruments, namely the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board Solar Orbiter and the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we follow these AR loops for an hour each on three consecutive
days. Our results show signiﬁcantly more resolved decayless waves in the higher-resolution EUI data compared with the AIA data.
Furthermore, the same system of loops exhibits many of these decayless oscillations on Day-2, while on Day-3, we detect very few
oscillations and on Day-1, we ﬁnd none at all. Analysis of photospheric magnetic ﬁeld data reveals that at most times, these loops were
rooted in sunspots, where supergranular ﬂows are generally absent. This suggests that supergranular ﬂows, which are often invoked
as drivers of decayless waves, are not necessarily driving such oscillations in our observations. Similarly, our ﬁndings also cast doubt
on other possible drivers of these waves, such as a transient driver or mode conversion of longitudinal waves near the loop footpoints.
In conclusion, through our analysis we ﬁnd that none of the commonly suspected sources proposed to drive decayless oscillations in
active region loops seems to be operating in this event and hence, the search for that elusive wave driver needs to continue.

1. Introduction

Decayless kink oscillations (or simply, decayless oscillations)
are generally observed to be small amplitude kink oscillations
exhibited by coronal loops. These oscillations are referred to as
decayless because they show no signiﬁcant decay in their ampli-
tudes over multiple wave periods (Tian et al. 2012; Anﬁnogen-
tov et al. 2013). More generally, decayless oscillations are ob-
served in the absence of any nearby transients (exceptions being
the oscillations reported in Wang et al. 2012 and Mandal et al.
2021). These properties are in stark contrast to the rapidly de-
caying kink oscillations associated with ﬂares and/or eruptions
(Nakariakov et al. 1999; Aschwanden et al. 1999). To persist
over multiple wave periods, these decayless oscillations must
overcome damping in the corona (e.g. via resonant absorption
or wave dissipation). However, since their discovery, the reason
for such persistent presence remains unknown.

Over the years, a number of theoretical and numerical stud-
ies have been performed to investigate the origin of these de-
cayless oscillations. While Nisticò et al. (2013) suggested that
a harmonic or a quasi-harmonic driver at the loop footpoints or
in the lower solar atmosphere, could generate the observed os-

cillations, Anﬁnogentov et al. (2015) argued in favour of a ran-
dom footpoint driving. In any case, both these models fail to
capture many observed properties of these oscillations. Nakari-
akov et al. (2016) proposed a self-oscillation model in which the
loop footpoints are driven by supergranular motions, analogous
to the sliding of a bow on a violin. In such a scenario, the oscil-
lation period is set by the system itself and not by the driver. In
simple terms, a non-periodic driver can produce periodic oscil-
lations when the oscillating system is in a self-oscillation mode
(Jenkins 2013). This idea was later adopted in a 3-D numeri-
cal simulation by Karampelas & Van Doorsselaere (2020) who
managed to produce basic observational features such as the de-
cayless behaviour of oscillations, their periods and amplitudes,
through a proof-of-concept model. Another way a loop could
reach a self-oscillating state is via Alfvénic vortex shedding, a
concept ﬁrst put forward by Nakariakov et al. (2009). 3-D nu-
merical modelling based on this idea was performed by Karam-
pelas & Van Doorsselaere (2021). In this case, a strong back-
ground ﬂow generates vortices near the loop boundary that are
then responsible for driving transverse loop displacements, akin
to decayless oscillations. Similar to earlier models, a steady ﬂow

generates periodic oscillations, a key feature of the self oscil-
lation process. The other idea related to such decayless wave
generation is through a combination of resonant absorption and
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) induced by the kink waves
near the loop boundaries, which lead to an apparent decayless
oscillation at low spatial resolution (Antolin et al. 2016). How-
ever, no consensus has been reached yet on how these decayless
oscillations actually originate (Nakariakov et al. 2021).

Thus far, decayless oscillations have mostly been detected
using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging data taken with the At-
mospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), onboard the Solar Dynam-
ics Observatory. The AIA images have a spatial resolution of
about 1.4(cid:48)(cid:48). In this work, we employ high resolution EUV imag-
ing data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI; Rochus et al.
2020) on board the recently launched Solar Orbiter (Müller et al.
2020) to re-investigate the phenomenon of decayless oscillations
in active region coronal loops. At the time of our observations,
Solar Orbiter was at a distance of ≈0.5 AU, nearly along the Sun-
Earth line. These data have a spatial resolution that is more than
two times higher than that of the data from the AIA instrument
(see Sect. 2 for details). This allows us to complement higher-
resolution EUI observations with co-temporal EUV images from
SDO/AIA to address the sub-arcsec nature of decayless oscilla-
tions for the ﬁrst time. Here we present observations of decayless
oscillations in a system of active region loops rooted in sunspots.
Our study provides important insights into the drivers of decay-
less oscillations.

2. Data

In this study, we use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging data
covering the active region NOAA 12957 between 2022-03-03
and 2022-03-05. These data were taken with the High Resolu-
tion Imager at 174 Å (HRIEUV) of EUI1 which followed this
active region (AR) for three successive days starting from 2022-
03-03, for about 1-hour on each day2. At the time of these ob-
servations, Solar Orbiter was located close to the Sun-Earth line
(see Table 1) and hence, we complement EUI observations with
data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al.
2012). In particular, we use EUV/UV images from the Atmo-
spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and line-
of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Mag-
netic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012), both onboard SDO.
Details of each of the datasets used in this study are presented in
Table 1. The alignment between AIA and EUI images were done
by combining information from the FITS headers and visual in-
spections. Lastly, we take into account the difference in light
travel times between Sun-EUI and Sun-SDO while analysing co-
temporal EUI-SDO datasets. In connection to this, all the time
stamps quoted in the paper are Earth times.

In order to remove effects of spacecraft jitter from EUI im-
ages, we used a cross-correlation based image alignment tech-
nique. This is done by ﬁrst dividing the full image sequence into
shorter, overlapping image sequences, in which, the last image
from a given shorter sequence would be the same as the ﬁrst im-
age in the following shorter sequence. Then all the images in a
given shorter sequence are co-aligned to the ﬁrst image in that

24414/2qfw-tr95
2 There are EUI observations of the same active region post 2022-03-
05 also. However, in those observations, either only a part of the active
region was captured or the observations were recorded with a signiﬁ-
cantly lower cadence.

are aligned to the ﬁrst image of the whole observing sequence
considered.

3. Results

All three EUI observing sequences used in this study primarily
imaged closed, nearly semi-circular (inferred visually from their
plane of sky projections) coronal loops in NOAA 12957. These
loops as observed with EUI and AIA are displayed in Fig. 1. Al-
though images from the EUI 174 Å and the AIA 171 Å ﬁlter ap-
pear quite similar to each other, differences, specially in terms
of their multi-threaded structuring, are also visible. For exam-
ple, the thread that we have highlighted with a white arrow on
Day-2 EUI image (Fig. 1c) is not visible in the corresponding
AIA 171 Å image (Fig. 1d). This is not only due to the roughly
two times better spatial resolution of EUI over AIA, it is also
related to the differences in passband response of HRIEU V and
AIA 171 Å. See Sec. A for a discussion on this. Lastly, we take a
note on the plethora of background features that we ﬁnd in Fig. 1.
It includes moss type structures as well as short background
loops (especially on Day-3; Fig. 1e-f). Nonetheless, looking at
the event movie (available online), we notice prominent loop os-
cillations on Day-2 image sequence whereas oscillations (if any)
on other two days are not so obviously detectable in the movie.

Thus, our aim is to ﬁrst quantitatively analyse these oscillations
and then search for the source that drives them.

3.1. Capturing transverse oscillations

In order to capture the observed transverse oscillations, we cre-
ated space-time (X-T) maps by placing artiﬁcial slits perpen-
dicular to the length of the loops. Final slit locations (the blue
rectangular boxes in Fig. 1) were selected by ﬁrst placing mul-
tiple such slits covering the entire length of a given loop and
then picking out only those slits along which we ﬁnd (visually)
prominent oscillation signals3. All panels of Fig. 2 present the
X-T maps derived for the given slit in Fig. 1. Moreover, to fur-
ther enhance the appearance of the oscillating threads in these
X-T maps, a smooth version of the map (boxcar-smoothed in
the transverse direction) is subtracted from each original map.
Prominent oscillation signatures are found on Day-2 along all the
three slits, both in the EUI and AIA data (Fig. 2e-j). Interestingly
on Day 3, we ﬁnd such oscillatory pattern in only one of the EUI
maps (derived from slit-S1; Fig. 2k) whereas the corresponding
co-temporal AIA map shows little oscillatory signal. On the con-
trary to the maps from these two days, none of the Day-1 maps
show any transverse oscillation signal. This suggests that coronal
loops within the same magnetic system exhibit decayless oscil-
lations somewhat sporadically. Furthermore, by looking at the
EUI and AIA images in Fig. 1, we ﬁnd that signiﬁcantly more
threads are present on Day-1 images as compared to Day-2 and
Day-3. The presence of such internal ﬁne structure within a loop
bundle could lead to overdamping of waves, as hinted in studies
by Luna et al. (2010) and Nisticò et al. (2014), and could po-
tentially be an explanation of why the oscillations are absent in
Day-1 datasets.

Before we delve further into this question of why these os-
cillation signals appear so pronounced on a particular day but
are mostly absent on other days, let us ﬁrst take a closer look
at the oscillations themselves. At a ﬁrst glance, it is evident that
the oscillations that we ﬁnd on Day-2 and Day-3, do not show

3 None of the Day-1 X-T maps show any oscillations and hence, the
slits shown in Fig. 1a,b are the ones for which the maps are relatively
free from any dynamic background features.

any considerable decay in their amplitudes over multiple wave
periods4. Hence, these waves clearly belong to the category of
‘decayless’ oscillations (Anﬁnogentov et al. 2013). In order to
quantitatively analyse these oscillations, we ﬁrst identify the lo-
cation of an individual strand in the X-T map at each time step
by ﬁtting a Gaussian along the transverse direction of that strand.
We then ﬁt these derived positions of the strand as a function of
time following the function:

(cid:18)

y(t) = A

sin

2πt
P

(cid:19)

+ φ

+ c1t + c0,

(1)

where A is the oscillation amplitude, P represents the period, φ
is the phase, and c0 and c1 are constants. Results based on these
ﬁts are shown in Fig. 2. The blue points highlight the detected
Gaussian mean of a given strand at each time-step, while the
black curves are the corresponding ﬁtted function.

We then study the relation between the derived periods and
amplitudes of these waves. Figure 3 shows the scatter plot be-
tween the ﬁtted A and P values. As seen from this plot, the
detected periods lie between 2 and 7 min (Pavg = 4.19 min,
σ = 0.75 min) while the displacement amplitudes are in the
range of 0.1 to 0.5 Mm (Aavg = 0.27 Mm, σ = 0.10 Mm).
These numbers are quite comparable to the values obtained by
Anﬁnogentov et al. (2015), who performed a statistical study of
these waves using data from AIA. Additionally, from Fig. 3, we
also ﬁnd a weak but positive correlation between oscillation pe-
riods and amplitudes. The Pearson correlation is estimated to be
0.28 (with the null hypothesis probability p=0.24) when consid-
ering all data points, while it is 0.49 (with p=0.07) with only
EUI data. Hence, from our sample set, we conclude that this is
not a statistically signiﬁcant relationship. However, using a much
larger sample set from AIA, Zhong et al. (2022) also reported the
presence of such a positive correlation between these two quan-
tities.

4 There are some oscillations (e.g. in Fig. 2g) which show no decay in
their amplitudes but last only for two wave periods. We still consider
them in our analysis since most of those oscillations appear on threads
that exhibit such decayless behaviour multiple times during the obser-
vation.

FOV as in Fig. 1 for all three days. Alongside, we also show
images from AIA 1600 Å, 171 Å, and 193 Å channels. Looking
at the Day-1 HMI magnetogram (panel 4a-1), we ﬁnd that the
AR has a clear bipolar structure with opposite polarities being
well separated from each other. The same structure through the
1600 Å channel (which mainly captures the uppermost photo-
sphere) reveals two well developed sunspots along with a pore
near the western spot. To locate photospheric footpoints of the
coronal loops under investigation, we overplot the contours of
±400 G as derived from the HMI data on every other panel.
Through this we ﬁnd that for most loops, both footpoints are
rooted within sunspots (either inside or at the edge of umbrae;
Fig. 3a-3,a-4). The situation remains more-or-less similar on the
other two days. HMI images of these two days (panel 4b-1,c-1)
reveal that the two dominant polarities of the active regions have
further evolved and separated compared to the scene on Day-1.
Signatures of new ﬂux emergence are also noted in these mag-
netograms. Similar to before, by following the HMI contours on
171 Å and 193 Å images, we ﬁnd the west side footpoint of one
of the oscillating loops (slit-S1) on Day-2 is now (partly) rooted
in a pore like structure.

In summary, we ﬁnd that the oscillating loops are mostly
rooted in regions of strong magnetic ﬁelds and the whole con-
ﬁguration does not show any signiﬁcant change over three days
of this observation. Moreover, it is known that sunspots or pores
are devoid of any supergranular motions and hence the scenario
of footpoint driving that we mentioned earlier seems not to be the
case here. However, it remains to be further addressed whether
horizontal motions, such as those observed in penumbral ﬁla-
ments or the large-scale ﬂows that drive the sunspots apart, could
also lead to these decayless oscillations.

image sequence. In some panels, the blue points highlight the
individual oscillating features, wherein the black curves repre-
sent the best ﬁt function (Eqn. 1) to those. An animated version
of this ﬁgure is available here

3.2. Magnetic conﬁguration of the loop footpoints

We shift our focus now towards ﬁnding the origin of these os-
cillations. One of the ways to explain the observed decayless os-
cillations is through self-oscillation. As mentioned in the intro-
duction, Nakariakov et al. (2016) proposed a scenario in which
the footpoints of the oscillating loops get perturbed by super-
granular ﬂows which then lead the system into a self-oscillation
state. To check whether such a mechanism is in operation also
in our case, we ﬁrst investigate whether there is any change in
the footpoint conﬁguration on Day-2 (when these oscillations
were widely present) as compared to Day-1 (when no oscilla-
tions were seen).

To this end, we concentrate on the magnetic conﬁguration of
this loop system using LOS magnetic ﬁeld data from HMI. In
different panels of Fig. 4, we show the HMI data for the same

on top of every image of a given row represent boundaries of ±400 G as derived from the time averaged HMI magnetogram of that
day.

3.3. Activity near the loop footpoints

While looking at the event movie (available online), we noticed
that although 171 Å and 193 Å ﬁlters do not show much coro-
nal (ﬂaring) activity, the 94 Å movie (which also samples ﬂaring
plasma of 5–7 MK temperature) seems to show quite a bit of
intensity enhancements and brightenings in-between two loop
footpoints. These intensity enhancements are related to low level
ﬂaring activity in the AR core (see e.g. Chitta et al. 2020). To
explore whether these small ﬂares play any role in generating
decayless oscillations, we analyse AIA light curves extracted
from a large enough region encompassing the brightening AR
core as shown by the white boxes in Panels 5a,c,e. Panels 5b,d,f
present the extracted curves (normalised to their maximum val-
ues). Looking at the Day-2 light curves, we ﬁnd two clear peaks
in the 94 Å data whereas the 171 Å and 193 Å curves do not
show similar features (these curves show a gradual increasing
trend).

Thus, at this point, we are tempted to conclude that the
prominent oscillation signals that we ﬁnd in Fig. 2e,g,i are
causally connected with these intensity enhancements. However,
light curves from the two other days do not exactly ﬁt into this
scheme. For example, on Day-1, we also see a peak in the 94 Å
channel, just before the EUI observation began on that day. How-
ever, the corresponding X-T maps (Fig. 2a,c) do not contain
any oscillation signal. On the contrary, on the Day-3 X-T map
(Fig. 2k) we ﬁnd an oscillation signal without any associated in-

tensity enhancement in any of the AIA channels (the small peak
near t≈80 min appears much later than the oscillations in the X-
T map). Hence, it is inconclusive at this moment whether there
is any causal link between the core brightenings that we observe
in 94 Å channel and the appearance of the decayless oscillations
in any of the loops. Furthermore, the brightenings in the 94 Å
channel appear to be spatially disconnected from the oscillating
loops or their footpoints. Based on these evidences, we suggest
that the observed ﬂaring activity is not very likely to contribute
towards the observed decayless oscillations.

3.4. Longitudinal perturbations at the footpoints

Finally, we explore the possibility of longitudinal perturbations
(near the loop footpoints) being the driver of the decayless os-
cillations. It is commonly observed that footpoints of AR loops
at coronal height host repetitive propagating disturbances whose
periods lie between 3 to 5 mins (De Moortel et al. 2000). These
features are generally explained in terms of p-modes leakage
from the lower atmosphere (De Pontieu et al. 2005). There have
been analytical as well as numerical studies in the past (e.g.,
Riedl et al. 2019) which show that these p-modes can in princi-
ple undergo mode conversion and manifest themselves as trans-
verse oscillations. Again, if this mechanism is in operation, then
we would expect a difference (due to some unknown reason)
in these longitudinal perturbations on Day-1 (when oscillations

cillations are seen). To test this hypothesis, we generate X-T
maps by placing slits near the footpoints of those loops that
show transverse oscillations. The green rectangular boxes shown
in Fig. 6a,d outline these slits wherein the derived maps are
shown in Fig. 6b,c,e,f. On both days, these maps show clear sig-
natures of repetitive propagating intensity disturbances at sub-
sonic speeds (approximately 30 km s−1). Thus, we conclude that
there is nothing special with these longitudinal perturbations at
the footpoints of coronal loops on Day-2, which could give rise
to the observed decayless oscillations.

4. Summary and Discussion

In this letter, we revisited the phenomena of decayless transverse
oscillations in AR loops. Using high resolution, high cadence
EUV imaging data, we followed a system of AR loops for three
consecutive days while it was passing the solar disc. Below we
highlight our main ﬁndings.

– One of our key results is related to the better visibility or
detectability of these oscillations in high resolution EUI
data (panels 2e,g,i) in comparison to AIA (panels 2f,h,j). We
conjecture that it is not solely due to the spatial resolution
difference between these two instruments, but rather has
contributions from the differences in their ﬁlter response as
well as instrument sensitivity. Nonetheless, if our ﬁnding
also holds for other loops, then it has a profound impact on
the calculation of total energy that is carried by these waves
as we can now resolve signiﬁcantly more of these on any

given loop, at any given time.

– Interestingly, the same system of loops does not always
show decayless oscillations, although the physical condi-
tions remain more-or-less the same.

– By studying the magnetic conﬁguration of the loop foot-
points (Fig. 4), we found that some of these loops were
rooted in sunspots which are known to be devoid of super-
granular ﬂows. Such ﬂows were previously considered to
be one of the ways to drive the loop footpoints and in turn,
generate these decayless oscillations. However, our analysis
shows that it is not the case in this event and hence, the
search for that elusive wave driver needs to continue.

– We have explored the possibility of a localised heating event
being the driver of these oscillations (Fig. 5). We found no
clear evidence for a causal connection between localised
heating events and the appearance of these oscillations. The
same also applies for the p-mode scenario (Fig. 6). Moreover,
we found no clear changes in the behaviour of longitudinal
waves at the loop footpoints driven by p-modes over the time
of observations, while the decayless oscillations were clearly
more sporadic.

In conclusion, through our analysis we found that none of the
commonly suspected sources proposed to drive decayless oscil-
lations in active region loops (e.g., supergranular ﬂows, transient
events and mode conversion near the loop footpoints) seemed

to be operating in the studied events. This however, does not
rule out the possibility that one of the above mentioned sources
may still be the dominant driver of decayless oscillations seen
in loops that are not rooted in sunspots. Further studies are nec-
essary to address the nature of decayless oscillations in loops
rooted in different magnetic environments in the photosphere.
To this end, EUV data with even higher resolution e.g., from
EUI, during its closest perihelion passage, would be best suited.

Appendix A: Comparison of loop visibility

between EUI and AIA data

As mentioned in Sec. 3, certain features that can be identiﬁed
in EUI 174 Å images, are missing in AIA 171 Å channel data
but visible in AIA 193 Å data. The loop thread that we highlight
with arrows in Fig. A.1 (and also in Fig. 1c) is an example of that.
From these evidences we conclude the following: 1) the thread
is a multi-thermal structure as it appears simultaneously in EUI
174 Å and AIA 193 Å. However, the scenario in which the thread
is an isothermal structure with a temperature that falls between
the peak response of EUI 174 Å and AIA 193 Å, is also a pos-
sibility, and 2) due to the slight shift in the peak of EUI 174 Å
bandpass towards somewhat higher temperatures than AIA 171Å
channel (see Fig. 1 of Chen et al. 2021), this loop only appears
in EUI but not in AIA 171Å.

towards a particular loop strand that we identiﬁed in the EUI
image. See text for details.
