ABSTRACT
The analysis of 20 years of spectrophotometric data of the double shell planetary
nebula PM 1-188 is presented, aiming to determine the time evolution of the emission
lines and the physical conditions of the nebula, as a consequence of the systematic
fading of its [WC 10] central star whose brightness has declined by about 10 mag in
the past 40 years. Our main results include that the [O iii], [O ii], [N ii] line intensities
are increasing with time in the inner nebula as a consequence of an increase in electron
temperature from 11,000 K in 2005 to more than 14,000 K in 2018, due to shocks.
The intensity of the same lines are decreasing in the outer nebula, due to a decrease in
temperature, from 13,000 K to 7,000 K, in the same period. The chemical composition
of the inner and outer shells was derived and they are similar. Both nebulae present
subsolar O, S and Ar abundances, while they are He, N and Ne rich. For the outer
nebula the values are 12+log He/H= 11.13±0.05, 12+log O/H = 8.04±0.04, 12+log
N/H= 7.87±0.06, 12+log S/H = 7.18±0.10 and 12+log Ar = 5.33±0.16. The O, S and
Ar abundances are several times lower than the average values found in disc non-Type
I PNe, and are reminiscent of some halo PNe. From high resolution spectra, an outﬂow
in the N-S direction was found in the inner zone. Position-velocity diagrams show that
the outﬂow expands at velocities in the −150 to 100 km s−1 range, and both shells
have expansion velocities of about 40 km s−1.

1 INTRODUCTION

Planetary nebulae (PNe) are formed from stars of low-
intermediate masses (1–8 M(cid:12)) in an advanced stage of evolu-
tion (post AGB). They have completely burnt hydrogen and
helium in their cores and possess dense carbon-oxygen cores
of about 0.6 M(cid:12). At these late stages, the star loses part
of its atmosphere through intense winds. It evolves towards
larger eﬀective temperatures and starts ionising the ejected
envelope. Thus the PN was part of the stellar atmosphere
and its chemical composition depends on the processes of
dredge-ups that carry elements of the interior to the sur-
face.

In general, central stars of PNe possess a thin H-rich en-
velope, but about 15% of them are known to be H-deﬁcient,
showing atmospheric instabilities and developing strong stel-
lar winds similar to the massive Wolf-Rayet stars. They have
been named [WR], to diﬀerentiate them from the massive

WR. Almost all of these stars are of the sequence of Car-
bon, showing strong helium, carbon and oxygen emission
lines, therefore they are designated as [WC] stars. It is found
that most of them are distributed in the early spectral types
[WC 2–4] which show lines of C iv, He ii and O v and have
eﬀective temperatures larger than 100,000 K, and in the late
spectral types [WC 8 – 11], showing lines of lower ions and
much lower eﬀective temperatures, from 25,000 K to 80,000
K (Koesterke 2001; Acker & Neiner 2003). There are very
few stars in the intermediate classes. In the following the
associated nebula will be called a [WC]PN.

PN G012.2+04.9, with common names PM 1-188,
HuBi 1 and IRAS 17514-1555, is a well known quite inter-
esting planetary nebula ﬁrst found by the IRAS satellite,
which during several decades has shown a central star of
the rare [WC 10] class. This was discovered by Hu & Bibo
(1990) who also reported a strong infrared excess in this ob-
ject. Since this discovery, PM1-188 has been actively studied
to reveal its nature and evolution.

a faint extended nebula surrounding a dense bright zone,
with apparently bipolar structure. Peña (2005b) reported
the extraordinary ionisation structure of the nebula, showing
that the [N ii] and [O iii] emission lines appear concentrated
in the inner zone, while the H lines are more intense in the
outer zone, presenting a cavity in the centre (see her Fig.
1). Also in this paper, the author indicated the systematic
fading of the central star.

Peña (2005b) reported that the [WC] central star of
PM 1-188 shows a systematic fading. The WR phenomenon
is known to be variable. Indeed, a few [WC] PNe show vari-
ations that could be intrinsic to the star or due to external
causes (Werner et al. 1992; Peña et al. 1997).

Leuenhagen & Hamann (1998) derived physical param-
eters of the central star of PM 1-188 from non-LTE theo-
retical stellar atmosphere models ﬁnding a mass loss rate
log ˙M=−5.70, a terminal wind velocity of about 360 km
s−1, a surface temperature of 35,000 K, a luminosity log
L/L(cid:12)=3.70 and a chemical composition, in mass fraction,
of β(He) = 42%, β(C) = 50%, β(O) = 7%, and a very small
amount of H. The remarkable He- and C-rich and H-poor
photospheric chemical composition is typical of [WC] stars
(Koesterke 2001) and it has been found in some born-again
PNe such as Abell 30, although in this case, β(He) amounts
63%, β(C), 20% and β(O), 15%, by mass (Todt et al. 2015),
chemistry more typical of a [WC-early] star. PM 1-188 might
have experienced an unusual evolution as Abell 30.

Peña et al. (2001) and Gorny et al. (2001) analysed some
nebular and dust properties in a number of [WC]PNe, and
they suggest a possible evolutionary sequence from [WC-
late] to [WC-early] objects, except for PM 1-188 and K 2-16,
both with a very late [WC] star. Peña et al. (2001) suggested
that these exceptions could have experienced a late-helium-
ﬂash and have returned to the AGB for a born-again evo-
lution, or they could be stars evolving very slowly from the
AGB due to their low mass.

Recently, Guerrero et al. (2018) deeply analysed the
nebular structure and the evolution of the central star,
claiming that the inner nebula is ionised by shocks with
velocity of about 70 km s−1; the outer nebula is recombin-
ing and, according to models of stellar evolution, the central
star is the descendent of a low-mass star that experienced a
born-again event whose ejecta shock-excite the inner shell.
In summary of these prior works, PM1-188 is deﬁnitely
a [WC 10] PN exhibiting time variations which might be
related to unusual stellar evolution. While the central star
seems to be more deeply understood, the nature of the neb-
ula remains unclear. To further advance understanding of
PM 1-188 and gain insights on evolution of born-again phe-
nomenon, time temporal evolution of the nebular parame-
ters and internal gas motion are necessary. For that purpose,
we gathered 20 years of low and high-resolution spectro-
scopic data and also newly secured high-dispersion spectra
to perform spatially-resolved studies of the nebula.

This paper is organized as follows: In §2 the observa-
tions are described. In §3, line intensities and their time evo-
lution in the inner and outer nebulae are analysed. In §4, we
present the physical conditions (electron temperatures and
densities) and their time evolution, and the derived ionic and
chemical abundances for both, inner and outer nebulae. In
§5 we discuss the evidence for shocks in the inner shell. The
presence of an outﬂow, derived from high-resolution spec-

tra, is shown in §6, while in §7 Position-Velocity diagrams
constructed from data obtained in two position angles, are
presented. The discussion and conclusions are displayed in
§8. In an appendix we present the Ionisation Corrections
Factors (ICFs) used to derive the chemical abundances and
the list of atomic parameters employed to determine the
physical conditions and chemistry of the nebula.

2 OBSERVATIONS

As said above, more than 20 years of spectroscopic ob-
servations of PM 1-188 have been gathered. Data prior to
2005 were already published in Peña et al. (2001) and Peña
(2005a), and are reanalysed here. New observations reported
in this work include spectrophotometric data obtained in
2005 with the Las Campanas Observatory (LCO) Clay tele-
scope and the LDSS3-Two spectrograph; observations with
the OAN-SPM 2-m telescope and the Boller & Chivens
(BCh) spectrograph in 2005 and 2017, and observations with
the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph (MES) in 2017. Also
observations with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and
OSIRIS spectrograph in long slit mode in 2018 (program
GTC112-18A, P.I. M. Guerrero), retrieved from the public
archives, are analysed here.

The log and characteristics of the observations are pre-
sented in Table 1 where we list the telescope and instrument
used, the covered wavelength range, the spectral resolution
(in Å/pix) and resolving power R (λ / δλ), the spatial scale,
the total exposure time, the slit size (length and width),
the position angle of the slit, P.A., the seeing during the
observations and some comments.

2.1 Description of spectroscopic data

Most of the data along these years was obtained at Observa-
torio Astronómico Nacional, San Pedro Mártir, B.C., Méx-
ico (OAN-SPM), with the 2.1-m telescope and the Boller &
Chivens (BCh) spectrograph, at intermediate resolution (4
– 7 Å/pix). Most of the time, the observed wavelength range
was from about 3700 to 7400 Å which allows to obtain a
large number of lines emitted in the visual zone. The spec-
tral resolution of these observations is adequate to resolve
the important [N ii] and [S ii] lines employed in temperature
and density diagnostic.

In two epochs (1997 and 2004) the high resolution
echelle REOSC spectrograph, that achieves a spectral reso-
lution of about 0.3 Å/pix (R=18000 at 5000 Å), was used. In
2017, the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph (MES) was em-
ployed in order to derive the interesting kinematics of this
nebula; these observations are described in the next subsec-
tion.

In 2005 spectra with the LDSS3-Two long-slit spectro-
graph, attached to the LCO 6.5-m telescope Clay were ob-
tained. This spectrograph works with two arms operating
simultaneously. The blue one covered from 3830 to 5150
Å and the red one, from 5160 to 6595 Å. The grism VPH
Blue was employed. Standard stars and a He-Ne-Ar lamp
were used for ﬂux and wavelength calibrations. The usual
procedures with IRAF 1 were performed for data reduction.

The nebular line ﬂuxes were measured in the calibrated spec-
tra, integrating all the emission over a local continuum esti-
mated by eye.

The central star is not visible in the spectra of 2017 or
2018 due to its faintness. But it was well detected in 2005,
when data with LCO telescope Clay were obtained. Fig. 1
shows a zone around Hα, where the stellar continuum and
the extended nebula are visible. Nebular [N ii] lines are very
intense in the inner zone, [N ii]λ6583 in particular appears
contaminated with the stellar C ii λ6582.9 line. [N ii] lines
are faint in the outer zone, but perfectly detected. Hα ap-
pears intense in the centre, overlapped to the stellar con-
tinuum, then it shows a cavity immediately outside and in-
creases its emission further away in the zone of the outer
nebula. The nebular lines are marked in the ﬁgure. The stel-
lar emission shows several WR lines of C ii, also marked in
the ﬁgure.

The most recent observations presented here were ob-
tained in 2018 with the GTC OSIRIS spectrograph in long
slit mode. Data were retrieved from the archives and data
reduction was performed with the standard procedures us-
ing IRAF. Flux and wavelength calibrations were carried
out with the standard star GD140 and the Hg-Ar-Ne lamp
provided in the same observations. These spectra covered
a wide wavelength range from 3700 to 7300 Å. The large
exposure time (105 min in total, distributed in 4 individual
observations of 1575 s each) helped to detect a large num-
ber of nebular lines, which allowed us to determine conﬁ-
dent physical conditions and ionic abundances. Nebular line
ﬂuxes were measured in the calibrated spectra, integrating
all the emission over a local continuum estimated by eye.

All the spectra of a given epoch were combined in a
single spectrum to increase the signal-to-noise. The total
observing time for each epoch is listed in Table 1. For the
analysis of lines, we made an eﬀort to obtain separately
the line intensities of the inner and outer nebulae in all
the spectra, although in the epochs previous to 2005, the

servatories, which is operated the Association of Universities for
Research in Astronomy, Inc., under contract to the National Sci-
ence Foundation.

[WC] central star was very bright and some of its emission
lines are contaminating some nebular lines such as the He i
λλ4471,5876,6678 lines and the [N ii] λ6583 line in the low
spectral-resolution data. Besides, it was not possible to ex-
tract the outer nebula separately, then the line ﬂuxes pre-
sented in Table 3 for 2000 and 2002, include all the nebular
emission.

On the other hand, spectra obtained with LCO-Clay-
LDSS3 in 2005, with OAN-SPM-BCh in 2017 and with
GTC-OSIRIS-LS in 2018 could be well separated in inner
and outer emission, and these data are not contaminated by
the stellar emission.

In general, the spatial proﬁles of lines in all our spec-
tra corroborate the behaviour presented by Guerrero et
al. (2018) regarding the emission structures of the inner
and outer nebulae. Lines of the ions N+ (λλ5755, 6548,
6583), O+ (λλ3727, 7325), O++ (λλ4959, 5007), He++
(λ4686), Ne++ (λ3869), S+ (λλ6716, 6717), Ar++ (λ7135),
O0 (λ6300) and N0 (λ5200) are concentrated in an inner
zone of about 2.5(cid:48)(cid:48), and all but [O ii]λ3727 present a small
central cavity. Hα, Hβ, He i 5876 Å, and other H and He i
lines are mainly concentrated in the outer nebula, and their
distribution show a central cavity of about 2.5” in the zone
where low-ionisation lines are intense.

Calibrated extracted spectra for both nebulae, as ob-
tained from GTC OSIRIS data, are presented in Fig. 2,
where the diﬀerent behaviour of [N ii] λλ6548,6583 lines, rel-
ative to Hα, in the inner and outer nebula, is noticeable.

2.2 MES observations

High resolution spectra were obtained with the OAN 2.1m
telescope and the Manchester Echelle Spectrometer (MES,
Meaburn et al. 1984; Meaburn et al. 2003) on 2017-06-29.
Four spectra of 1800 s exposure time each were acquired,
with the slit oriented E-W. These spectra were combined in
one of 7200 s of total exposure time. The slit was 2(cid:48)(cid:48) wide
and 6.5(cid:48) length. A δλ = 90 Å bandwidth ﬁlter was used to
isolate the order 87, covering the interval from 6545 Å to
6595 Å, which then includes Hα and [N ii] 6548 Å and 6583
Å lines. A binning of 2×2 was implemented giving a spectral

Figure 1. The nebular lines Hα λ6563 and [N ii] λλ6548,6583 are
shown from the 2D LCO-Clay-LDSS3 spectrum, obtained in 2005,
with the slit at P.A. 173◦. The spatial scale is indicated in the
left side, with the origin in the stellar continuum. The extended
nebula is clearly visible in these lines. The compact inner nebula
presents intense [N ii] lines, diminishing towards the outer nebula,
while Hα is more intense in the outer nebula. The wavelengths
of nebular lines are marked in black. The stellar continuum and
several [WR] lines of C ii are detected and marked in red. In
particular, the C ii λ6582.9 line, overlapped with the [N ii] λ6583
line, is very intense.

resolution of 0.06 Å/pix, equivalent to 11 km s−1, and a
spatial resolution of 0.35 (cid:48)(cid:48)/pix. The wavelength calibration
was performed with a Th-Ar lamp, no ﬂux calibration was
done.

Another spectrum was obtained with MES on 2017-06-
30, with total exposure time of 3600 s, and the slit oriented
N-S (P.A. 0◦). On this and the other occasions the slit was
centred in the central star position.

3 LINE FLUXES AND TIME VARIATION OF

LINES IN THE INNER AND OUTER
NEBULAE

Emission of the inner nebula was extracted from the two
central arcsecs. Fluxes measured for this zone, for the dif-
ferent epochs, relative to Hβ, not corrected by reddening,
F(λ), are presented in Table 2. The latter two lines in this
table present, for each epoch, the total ﬂux measured for Hβ
through the slit and the logarithmic reddening correction,
c(Hβ) with its uncertainties. For each observation, the log-
arithmic reddening correction was derived by using Cardelli
et al. (1989) reddening law by assuming a ratio of total to
selective extinction RV = 3.1 and by using the theoretical
Hα/Hβ ratios given by Storey & Hummer (1995) for tem-
peratures of 7,500 K, 10,000 K, 12,500 K and 15,000 K, ade-
quate to the value derived for each observation. For all cases,
case B recombination theory and a density of 100 cm−3 were
assumed. In the calculus of c(Hβ) we did not take into ac-
count the minimal contamination of He ii λ4860 and λ6560
in the intensities of Hβ and Hα which in both cases amount
less than 0.5%, for the inner nebula.

The observed ﬂuxes were dereddened by using the men-
tioned reddening law, and the c(Hβ) value determined in
each case. The results, relative to I(Hβ), are presented in
the same table, under the header I(λ). The uncertainties for

I(λ), calculated by considering the uncertainties in the ﬂuxes
and in c(Hβ), are presented in %, enclosed in parenthesis.

The emission of the outer nebula was extracted from the
zones around the central cavity presented by the H lines.
Both zones at each side of the centre were extracted and
then combined. The ﬂuxes F(λ), relative to Hβ, not cor-
rected by reddening, are presented in Table 3. The same as
in the case of the inner nebula, ﬂuxes were dereddened with
Cardelli et al. (1989) reddening law and c(Hβ) derived in
each case. These intensities, relative to I(Hβ), and their re-
spective uncertainties, in percentage, are listed in the same
table. The latter two lines of the table indicate the observed
Hβ ﬂuxes and the derived logarithmic reddening corrections
c(Hβ) with their uncertainties.

The analysis of the line intensities in Tables 2 and 3
indicates that prior to 2005, the He ii λ4686 line, if it ex-
isted, would appear blended (or hidden) in the WR bump
at λλ4640-4686. As time goes by and the central star weak-
ens, the WR bump disappears and the nebular He ii line
brights alone with an intensity of about 0.1 Hβ in 2017 -
2018. It could be that the line intensity has been slightly
increasing with time from 0.10 in 2005 to 0.13 in 2018, rel-
ative to Hβ, but the uncertainties (of about 15 % for GTC
OSIRIS value and larger for OAN-BCh and LCO-LSST2
values) make this not conclusive. In the outer nebula He ii
λ4686 is not detected in the spectra of LCO (2005) nor in
spectra of OAN-SPM (2017), and GTC (2018).

The low ionisation lines of [O ii], [N ii], and [S ii are
intense in the inner nebula. In particular, the [N ii]λ6548
shows values about half or more Hα, indicating that the
nebular [N ii]λ6583 (which is about 3 times more intense
than λ6548) would be several times Hα. This is indicative
of possible shocks as it will be discussed in §5.

The [O iii]λ5007 is also intense in the inner zone, al-
though it is always fainter than Hβ, as expected due to this
nebula is ionised by a 35,000 - 38,000 K eﬀective tempera-
ture star which does not produce enough photons to ionise
a large fraction of O+.

In the outer nebula all these low ionisation lines are
detected, but much fainter, for instance the [O ii]λ3727/Hβ
intensity ratio changes from about 7.9 in the inner zone to
0.4 in the outer zone, and I([N ii]λ6548)/I(Hβ) has a value
of about 2.7 in the inner zone and about 0.4 in the outer
nebula (both values from the dereddened line observations
on 2018). [O iii]λ5007 is barely detected in the outer nebula.
Other lines appearing in the inner nebula, that are faint
or non-existent in the outer nebula, are [Ne iii]λ3869 and
[Ar iii]λ7135.

The time evolution of several lines, in the inner and
outer nebulae, are presented in Fig. 3 where it is found that
the [O iii]λ5007, [O ii]λλ3727,7325, [S ii]λ6716, [O i] λ6300
and the [N ii]λλ5755,6548 lines have increased with time in
the inner nebula, while the opposite occurs in the outer one.
Such a behaviour of the collisionally excited lines seems to
be a consequence of the electron temperature that increases
with time in the inner nebula and decreases in the outer
nebula as it is explained in the next section.

The evolution of [N ii]λλ5755,6548 lines in the inner
nebula, deserves a particular mention, as their intensities
appear slightly declining from 2000 to 2004 and then increas-
ing abruptly in 2005 to continue increasing up to 2018. This
behaviour could be a consequence of the evolution of temper-

ature in this nebula. The increase in temperature is aﬀecting
all the collisionally excited lines, but it is aﬀecting in partic-
ular the [N ii] lines that are very sensitive to electron tem-
peratures and shocks. Unfortunately the [O ii]λλ3727,7325
lines were not observed in 2005 to verify if they show the
same behaviour.

In the inner nebula the He i lines are intense and they
are aﬀected by blends with stellar lines in the spectra previ-
ous to 2005. That is the reason of the large ﬂux of He iλ5876
in 2000 - 2002. Afterwards when the stellar brightness de-
clines, He iλ5876 is not contaminated by the star and it
shows an intensity near 0.2 I(Hβ) in both, the inner and
outer nebulae. The He i lines have not varied since 2005. As
said before by (Peña 2005a) He i lines are intense in both
nebulae, indicating a large He abundance.

The logarithmic reddening correction, c(Hβ), has not
changed with time, with an average value of 1.04±0.04 in the
inner nebula and 0.94±0.06 in the outer nebula (considering
only the values from LCO 2005, SPM 2017, and GTC 2018,
which are not aﬀected by stellar emission). Both values are
equal within uncertainties.

4 PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AND CHEMICAL

ABUNDANCES OF THE NEBULAE

From the nebular lines, in particular from those collisionally
excited lines, physical conditions such as electron densities
and temperatures can be derived from some diagnostic line
ratios. In the inner and outer nebulae, densities can be de-
termined from the [S ii] λλ6716/6731 intensity ratios and
electron temperatures from the [N ii] λλ5755/6548 (λ6583
line was avoided due to possible contamination with the
stellar C ii λ6582.9 line), [S ii] λλ4086/(6716+31) and [O ii]
λλ3727/7325 intensity ratios.

All the densities and temperatures for diﬀerent epochs,
for inner and outer nebulae, were calculated with PyNeb
(Luridiana et al. 2015), using the atomic data presented in
Table A1 (Appendix). PyNeb routine getCrossTemden was
used to determine simultaneously the temperature and den-
sity from the [N ii] and [S ii] diagnostic lines. The results are
presented in Table 4. Densities derived from [S ii] lines are
always low, but the inner nebula is slightly denser (a few
hundred particles per cm3) than the outer nebula that has
a density of about a hundred particles per cm3.

Regarding the temperature, the value derived from the
[N ii] λλ5755/6748 line ratio for the outer nebula is near
7,000 K in 2018, and more than 14,000 K in the inner nebula.
Both temperatures are higher (but very uncertain) from the

[S ii] λλ4068/(6716 + 31) and [O ii] λλ3727/7325 diagnostic
ratios.

The evolution of the electron temperature in both neb-
ulae, derived from the [N ii] diagnostic ratios, is plotted as
a function of time in Fig. 4. Despite the errors that can
be as large as 1,000 K, it is evident an opposite systematic
behavior in both nebulae. In the inner one the electron tem-
perature has increased from about 11,000 K in the epoch
2000 - 2005 to more than 14,000 K in 2018. According to
the photo-ionisation model including shock excitation, pre-
sented by Guerrero et al. (2018), this inner nebula is appar-
ently heated by a shock with velocity ∼ 70 km s−1 traveling
outwards the ionised shell. The origin of the temperature
rise in this zone should be the traveling shock and the out-
ﬂow expanding at about 150 km s−1 in this zone (see §6).
The rise in electron temperature is producing the increase
in line intensities of heavy elements in this zone, aﬀecting in
particular the [N ii] lines, as shown in Fig. 3.

On the opposite, the electron temperature has de-
creased in the outer nebula, from about 13,000 K in the
epoch 2000-2005 to about 7,000 K in 2017-2018. This phe-
nomenon is certainly showing the eﬀect of the fading of the
central star. Less and less ionising photons have been ar-
riving to the external nebula since few decades ago, and
as a consequence, the gas is cooling fast, and also recom-
bining, but at a much slower rate. Supplementary Fig 4.
by Guerrero et al. (2018) shows a simple photo-ionisation
model evaluating the time evolution of electron temperature,
the ionisation fraction of H, and the emissivities of various
lines in a spherical photo-ionised nebula, after the turn oﬀ of
the ionising source. This model predicts that emissivities of
[N ii], [O ii] and [S ii] lines decrease slowly up to about 100
yr, and at this point all these emissivities decrease abruptly,
when the electron temperature diminishes to less than about
7,000 K. On the other hand, the emissivity of [O iii] λ5007
line decreases much faster. Our data for this zone, showing
the decrease in temperature and the decay of heavy element
line intensities, explained in the previous section, corrobo-
rate these predictions.

4.1

Ionic and total abundances

Ionic abundances were calculated by using the physical con-
ditions derived for each epoch and the dereddened line in-
tensities presented in Tables 2 and 3. The electron density
derived from [S ii] λλ6716/6731 line ratio and the temper-
ature derived from the [N ii] λλ5755/6548 line ratio were
used in each case. When no density value was available, we
assumed a value of 100 cm−3. The results are presented in
Table 4.

Total abundances were derived from the ionic abun-
dances and the ionisation correction factors (ICF) from
Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994) and Delgado-Inglada et al.
(2014) to correct for the ions not visible in the optical spec-
trum. The expressions used for calculating the ICFs and to
derive the total abundances are listed in the Appendix. The
values obtained in each case are presented in Table 4, be-
low the ionic abundances of each element. The derived total
abundances are also listed in Table 4.

In the following, for the discussion, we adopt the abun-
dances obtained from the GTC 2018 observations for both
nebulae, which present the lowest uncertainties and are more
complete. PM 1-188 outer nebula shows sub-solar O, S and
Ar abundances, with 12+log O/H = 8.05±0.04, 12+log S/H
= 7.18±0.10 and 12+log Ar/H = 5.33±0.16 but it is He
and N rich, with 12+log He/H = 11.14±0.05 and log N/O
= −0.18±0.19 (solar abundances as given by Asplund et
al. 2009 have been adopted). This occurs as well in the in-
ner shocked nebula which shows 12+log O/H = 7.99±0.05,
12+log He/H = 11.13±0.05, log N/O = −0.06±0.07, log
Ne/O = 0.26±0.08, log S/O = −0.99±0.11, and log Ar/O
= −2.32±0.09. Thus, in addition to be He and N rich, the
inner zone appears very Ne enriched, relative to O. Neon
cannot be measured in the outer zone, due to the absence
or faintness of Ne lines. It is found that the chemical abun-
dances of He, O, S, and Ar in the inner and outer nebulae
are equal considering the uncertainties. In §8, we discuss the
chemistry in PM 1-188, in comparison with other PNe in the
galaxy.

In Fig. 5 it is found that the empty symbols (corre-
sponding to the outer nebula) and the ﬁlled symbols (cor-
responding to the inner nebula) for the same epoch show
a systematic diﬀerent behaviour in the three BPT dia-
grams. Empty symbols appear always down and to the left
of ﬁlled symbols, that is, they present lower values of the
[O iii]λ5007/Hβ intensity ratio and lower values of the low-
ionisation lines, relative to Hα. This is particularly notice-
able for the GTC-2018 data (magenta diamonds) where the
ﬁlled symbols (inner nebula) lie to the right of the Kewley’s
models in the cases of [N ii]λ6583/Hα and [O i]λ6300/Hα,
(the case of [S ii]/Hα line ratio is marginal), indicating that
the ionising mechanisms in this zone is not photoionisation
but a diﬀerent one, like heating by shocks. As this occurs for
all the epochs, it implies that the inner nebula appears al-
ways as heated by shocks. In the case of [S ii] lines (panel b),
almost all the points are placed in the photoionisation zone.
This would be related to the radiation strength in UV wave-
length adopted by Kewley´s models which were built with
solar metallicities. In a metal-deﬁcient environment such
as in PM 1-188 which shows low S abundance, the respec-
tive [O iii]λ5007/Hβ and [S ii]/Hα intensities are expected
to become stronger and lower than the values indicated by
Kewley´s models. Thus, the observed low [O iii]λ5007/Hβ
and strong [S ii]/Hα values in the inner nebula could be ex-
plained by shocks rather than photoionisation.

Thus, by means of BPT diagrams, we have corroborated
that the inner nebula is mainly heated by shocks, while the
outer nebula is photoionised.

6 THE OUTFLOW FROM THE CENTRAL

STAR

We ﬁrst noticed an outﬂow ejected from the central star in
the OAN-SPM echelle REOSC spectrum obtained in 2004,
with the slit position in the E-W direction (P.A. 90◦). The
outﬂow was clearly visible in both [N ii]λ6548 and λ6583
lines and it did not appear in the Hα line. The jet emission
was more intense and extended to the blue side of the lines,
being the red emission fainter.

These results were conﬁrmed in the high resolution
spectrum obtained with the MES on 2017-06-29 (see Fig.
6). The outﬂow found in the 2004 echelle REOSC spectrum
appears better deﬁned in the MES spectrum due to the bet-
ter spectral resolution of MES, and to a larger exposure
time. This outﬂow is evidently ejected from the central star.
The spectrum obtained for Hα, in this orientation, shows
an ellipse with a cavity in the centre where the expansion
velocity is the highest.

The spectrum obtained with MES at P.A. of 0◦ does not
show the outﬂow (see Fig. 6). Interestingly the two lobes of
the Hα emission, corresponding to the outer nebula, appear
tilted with a displacement of about 15 km s−1, being the
northern zone to the blue. This is showing that the outer
nebula is not spherical as it appears in the images (and so
it was classiﬁed by Sahai et al. 2011 as R,*,ib: round with
an inner bubble, a visible star). Our Hα images are equal
to the PV diagrams presented by Guerrero et al. (2018)
who claimed that this behaviour corresponds to a barrel-
like structure whose symmetry axis is tilted to the line of
sight by 25◦.

5 SHOCKS IN PM 1-188? DIAGNOSTIC

DIAGRAMS

BPT diagnostic diagrams (Baldwin et al. 1981; Veilleux &
Osterbrock 1987) have been used for many years to analyse
the ionising mechanism producing an ionised region. In fact,
Baldwin et al. (1981), suggested a two-dimensional quan-
titative classiﬁcation scheme to separate, verbatim, “nor-
mal H ii regions, planetary nebulae, objects photoionised
by a power-law continuum, and objects excited by shock-
wave heating”. The most used line intensity ratios are log
[O iii]λ5007/Hβ vs. log [N ii]λ6583/Hα, log [O iii]λ5007/Hβ
vs. log [S ii](λλ6717+31)/Hα, and log [O iii]λ5007/Hβ vs.
log [O i]λ6300/Hα.

More recently Kewley et al. (2001) built a theoretical
classiﬁcation scheme to establish an upper limit for starburst
models on the optical BTP diagnostic diagrams. While BPT
diagrams were constructed to separate nebulae with diﬀer-
ent ionisation mechanisms and the theoretical Kewley et al.
(2001) models where constructed to separate starbursts from
AGNs, the physics of the line formation in PNe is the same,
therefore we will study the nature of the line mechanism pro-
duction in the inner and outer nebulae in PM1-188 through
these diagrams. This is not the ﬁrst time that diagnostic di-
agrams are used to this purpose in PNe, (see e.g., Raga et
al. 2008; Akras & Goncalves 2016, and references therein).
In Fig. 5, we present diagrams of [O iii]λ5007/Hβ vs.
[N ii]λ6583/Hα, [S ii]λ(6717+6731)/Hα, and [O i]λ6300/Hα
for the inner and outer nebulae. The dereddened intensity
values are taken from Tables 2 and 3 and are plotted with
ﬁlled and open symbols for the inner and outer nebulae,
respectively. The diﬀerent epochs are marked with diﬀerent
symbols and colours as explained in the ﬁgure caption.

It should be noticed that, as we said before, the [N ii]
λ6583 line may be polluted with the stellar C ii λ6582.9 line
previous to 2005, therefore, we used the [N ii] λ6548 line in-
tensity multiplied by 3, to obtain the [N ii] λ6583 intensity.
The solid and dashed lines in this ﬁgure correspond to Kew-
ley et al. (2001) models and their uncertainties, respectively.
These models helps to separate the regions photoionised by
stars from the ones ionised by other mechanisms.

The solid and dashed lines in this ﬁgure correspond to Kewley et al. (2001) models and their uncertainties, respectively, and separate H ii
region-like objects from AGNs. The diﬀerent epochs are marked with diﬀerent symbols, OAN-2000: vertical triagles, OAN-2002: squares,
OAN-2005: stars, LCO-2005: crosses, OAN-2017: horizontal triangles, GTC-2018: diamonds. The ﬁlled symbols correspond to the inner
nebula and the empty symbols, to the outer zone. The points to the right of the solid line are interpreted as regions heated by shocks.

In the N-S oriented image (P.A. 0◦), the [N ii] emission
is strong and wide in the centre and faint and elongated
towards the N-S direction, showing some faint ﬁlamentary
structure.

The observed radial velocity of the object, derived from
these high resolution spectra, is +56.2±1 km s−1 and the
heliocentric velocity is vsys = 53.9±1 km s−1.

The velocity ﬁelds obtained from the MES high resolu-
tion spectra are analysed in the next section, by means of
Position-Velocity diagrams.

7 POSITION VELOCITY DIAGRAMS

Position-velocity diagrams (PVD) were constructed for the
MES 2017 data at slit positions P.A. 90◦ and P.A. 0◦, for
the [N ii]λ6583 and Hα lines in order to explore the nebu-
lar kinematics. It is safe to use these lines because at this
epoch the star was too faint, it was not detected and does
not contaminate the nebular lines. These PVD were pro-
duced in Python, using the Astropy library. Our code reads
our MES data and plots them using the proper scale plate
and the radial velocity resolution. As the slit was placed on
the central star for the two positions, P.A. 90◦ and P.A. 0◦,
the spatial origin is the position of the central star and the
spatial distribution takes into account a pixel size of 0.36(cid:48)(cid:48).
To reconstruct the radial velocities, we used the rest wave-
lengths of Hα and [N ii]λ6583 lines, relatives to the systemic
velocity (vsys=53.9 km s−1), thus we can analyse the kine-
matics of these lines.

The PV diagrams are presented in Fig. 6. The line con-
tours in each diagram represent the intensities of the lines,
each line has its ad-hoc contour separation, as explained
later.

7.1 The PV diagrams at P.A. 90◦

In Fig. 6 (up, left), we can observed the Hα emission pre-
senting two peaks and a cavity in the centre. The contours

show a maximum expansion velocity HWHM of about 40
km s−1 in the centre.

The contours for the Hα PVD represent the 10%, 20%,
30%, 40%, and 50% of the total intensity from the outer
to the inner contour respectively. The 10% contour shows a
faint elongation to the blue.

The [N ii]λ6583 PV diagram (Fig. 6, up, right) shows
a complex structure. Here the contours represent the 7%,
10%, 15%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the total intensity from the
outer to the inner contour respectively. The structure does
not exhibit the two peaks noticed in Hα, but only one cen-
trally concentrated bright emission (slightly blue shifted).
This zone has an expansion velocity of about 40 km s−1.
The most spectacular fact in this diagram is the evident out-
ﬂow emerging from the central star, with velocities ranging
from −150 to 100 km s−1. The outﬂow to the blue is more
extended and brighter than the red one, possibly due to a
larger extinction in the back. The outﬂow is visible mainly
in the [N ii] lines. It is only barely observed in Hα because
its position coincides with the cavity shown in Hα in the
central zone.

7.2 The PV diagrams at P.A. 0◦

The Hα and [N ii]λ6583 PV diagrams, for this direction, are
shown in Fig. 6 down (left and right respectively).

The contours in the Hα PVD represent the same in-
tensity levels as in the E-W PV diagram. In this case the
Hα lobes, corresponding to the north and south sides of the
outer nebula, are displaced in velocity by about 15 km s−1
one from the other. The northern lobe is shifted to the blue.
This behaviour indicates that the nebula is not spherical,
but an open-ended (barrel-like) elongated structure.

The [N ii]λ6583 PVD in this orientation shows a con-
centrated central zone with an expansion velocity ≤ 40 km
s−1. A faint ﬁlamentary structure extending from North to
South, of about 20 arcsec long, corresponding with the outer
zone, is noticed. No outﬂow is found in this orientation.

From the PV diagrams the kinematic ages for the inner

and outer nebulae can be derived. A distance of 5.36 kpc to
PM 1-188 as published by Frew et al. (2016) was adopted.
Therefore, from our Hα image at P.A.=90◦ which shows a
projected nebular size of 10 arcsec and an expansion velocity
of 40 km s−1, we compute a kinematic nebular age of 6,400
yr for the outer nebula. This is a lower limit if the structure
is elongated and inclined with respect to the line of sight
as proposed by Guerrero et al. (2018). For the inner nebula
we used the [N ii]λ6583 P.A.=90◦ image and performed the
same calculations taking into account a size of 3 arcsec and
an expansion velocity of 40 km s−1, from these data we com-
puted a lower-limit kinematic age of 1,900 yr. A kinematic
age can be determined also for the outﬂow by assuming that
we are seeing only one pulse. This structure shows a size of
2 arcsec and an expansion velocity of 150 km s−1, then a
kinematic age equal to 335 yr is derived.

8 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

PM 1-188 is a planetary nebula with a central star of the
rare spectral type [WC 10], whose brightness has been di-
minishing with time, losing about 10 magnitudes in the last
40 years. The central star seems to have had an event of the
born-again type as claimed by Guerrero et al. (2018). A few
born-again central stars have been reported in the literature.
The most studied cases are A 30, A 78, A 58 and recently
WR 72 (Wesson et al. 2008; Gvaramatze et al. 2020, and ref-
erences therein). They have been explained through a very
late thermal pulse (VLTP) of a post-AGB star. The main
characteristics of these born-again central stars (mostly clas-
siﬁed as [WC early] or [WC early]-PG1159 stars) and their
associated PNe are the existence of an outer evolved H-rich
nebula, and an inner H-deﬁcient shell which in many cases
shows knots with cometary tails extended radially. Interest-
ingly, a binary central star was found in A 30 (Jacoby et
al. 2020). Some of these characteristics have been found in

10 M. Peña et al.

PM 1-188, in particular the existence of an outer low density
nebula, and a compact denser inner shell showing an outﬂow
similar to the cometary tails. However the eﬀective temper-
ature of its central star is much lower than that found in
the mentioned born-again stars, and such objects have not
shown the decrease in brightness displayed by PM 1-188 cen-
tral star.

In this work the spectrophotometric behaviour of the
ionised gas in PM 1-188 is analysed by means of medium and
high resolution spectra obtained from observations along 20
years. This allows us to study the time evolution of emission
lines in the inner and outer nebulae. Also, the time evolution
of physical parameters is analysed.

The outer extended nebula emits H and He lines, and
faint low-ionised heavy-element (N+, O+, and S+) lines. We
found that the heavy-elements emission lines have been de-
creasing with time and also the electron temperature has
diminished from about 13,000 K previous 2005 to less than
7,000 K in 2018. Therefore this section of the nebula, ejected
during the ﬁrst time the star was in the AGB zone, has been
recently cooling and recombining with time as a consequence
of the fading of the central star because less and less ionising
photons arrive to the outer nebula with time. A kinematic
age of 6,400 yr was calculated from the projected nebular
dimension, the distance and the expansion velocity. This age
could be larger if the structure is elongated and inclined, as
propose Guerrero et al. (2018).

The inner nebula shows very intense lines of low ionised
species such as N+, O+, and S+. Also weak lines of O++,
Ne++ and He++ are found in this zone. It is particularly
interesting the faint emission of the He iiλ4686 found in this
nebula. Given that the eﬀective temperature of the central
star (35,000 – 38,000 K) is too low and it does not emit
the hard UV photons needed to ionise He twice, the He++
should be produced in the shocked region, as predicted by
the shock model presented by Guerrero et al. (2018). BPT
diagrams constructed by us also indicate that the ionising
mechanisms in the inner nebula is not photoionisation but a
diﬀerent one as heating by shocks. Besides the unexpected
emergence of He iiλ4686 in this zone, we found that the in-
tensities of [O iii]λ5007, [O ii]λ3727, and [N ii]λ6548,83 have
increased with time in the inner nebula, corresponding with
an increasing electron temperature, which has varied from
11,000 K previous 2005 to more than 14,000 K in 2018. The
origin of the temperature rise in this zone is evidently the
shock mentioned above. The kinematic age derived for this
nebula, from out data is about 1,900 yr.

Total abundances were derived from the ionic abun-
dances, by using ICFs by Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994) and
Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014), for the inner and outer neb-
ulae. The derived values for the inner nebula are 12+log
He/H = 11.13±0.05, 12+log O/H = 7.99±0.05, log N/O =
−0.06±0.07, log Ne/O = 0.26±0.08, log S/O = −0.99±0.11,
and log Ar/O = −2.32±0.09 and they are similar for the
outer nebula. The nebular chemistry of PM 1-188 is pecu-
liar. In comparison with the chemistry of disc non-Type
I PNe, with average values 12+log He/H = 11.05±0.06,
12+log O/H = 8.69±0.20, 12+log N/H = 8.14±0.20, 12+log
Ne/H = 8.10±0.15, 12+log S/H= 6.90±0.30, 12+log Ar/H
= 6.38±0.30 as presented by Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994),
it is found that PM 1-188 is very O, S and Ar poor, and He,
N and Ne rich. Thus, the abundances of PM 1-188 do not

correspond to disc PNe even when its position locates it in
the galactic disc. The low abundances of the α elements O,
S and Ar indicate that PM1-188 was formed in a low abun-
dance medium, while the enrichment of He, N and Ne seems
a consequence of the stellar nucleosynthesis. The chemistry
of PM 1-188 is reminiscent of the chemical abundances of
some halo PNe (see the analysis for DdDm-1 and other halo
PNe presented by Henry et al. 2008), in particular it is remi-
niscent of BoBn 1 which is very O, S and Ar poor and shows
large C, N and Ne enrichment. Otsuka et al. (2010) derived
12+log O/H = 7.74, log N/O = 0.29, log Ne/O = 0.22, log
S/O = -2.42, and log Ar/O = -3.41, and to explain the ele-
mental abundances in BoBn 1 Otsuka et al. (2010) proposed
for this nebula a progenitor of 1 – 1.5 M(cid:12) initial mass star
or a 0.75+1.5 M(cid:12) binary system. To suggest a binary sys-
tem as origin of PM 1-188 is tempting considering the rare
behaviour of the central star which ejected a nebula more
than 6,000 yr ago and actually, after an apparent born-again
episode, presents atmospheric instabilities, a second shocked
younger nebula and outﬂows. However, so far there is not
evidence for a binary central star.

An outﬂow emerging from the central zone was found
in our high resolution spectra obtained in P.A. 90◦. It is
bright in [N ii] lines and does not appear in Hα due to H
lines show a cavity in this zone. From our position-velocity
diagrams, it is found that this outﬂow shows a velocity from
−150 to 100 km s−1. The blue side is brighter and the red
side is fainter possibly due to large reddening in the back-
side. We also estimated the age of the outﬂow to be 335 yr.
Rechy-García et al. (2020) reported to have found a shell-
like structure expanding at 300 km s−1 with an age of 200
yr in PM 1-188. This coincides very well with the outﬂow in
direction N-S we are ﬁnding. Due to we have not obtained
MES observations in other directions we can not assert that
the ejection has a shell-like structure, but we do not detect
such an outﬂow in the observations with P.A. 0◦. Therefore
the structure detected by Rechy-García et al. (2020) should
be a broken shell. If this structure were a complete shell, the
energy required to keep it in motion should be larger than
1045 erg, which is too large for the central star to provide it.
A hydrodynamical model taking into account the detected
outﬂow and the photoionisation by the central object is in
progress to study in detail the kinematics in the inner shell
and its evolution (Rodríguez-González et al. in prep.)

Other result obtained in this work, is the systemic radial
velocity of 56±1 km s−1 and a heliocentric velocity of 53.9±1
km s−1 obtained from our high resolution spectra.

Since its discovery, the planetary nebula PM 1-188 has
given us many surprises and we have slowly advanced in the
understanding of this object, but still several facts remain
unexplained. Deeper observations in the optical and other
wavelength ranges are necessary to get a deep insight of this
peculiar object.

OoR is Out of Range; — indicates line not detected or not measurable.
a The errors in ﬂux are about 2-3% when F(λ)/F(Hβ)≥1, about 10 % when F(λ)/F(Hβ) ∼ 0.5, about 20% when F(λ)/F(Hβ)≤0.2,
a lines marked with : are very uncertain.
b The errors in I(λ), taking into account the uncertainties in c(Hβ), are given in % enclosed in parenthesis.
c The absolute ﬂux in Hβ is in units of E-14 erg cm−2 s−1 and it is only indicative as it depends on the extraction window, the observing conditions, etc.

APPENDIX A: ATOMIC PARAMETERS USED
IN PYNEB CALCULATIONS AND THE
IONISATION CORRECTION FACTORS

ICFs used for the total abundances calculation are listed
next. Those marked with KB94 correspond to the expres-
sions from Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994) and those marked
DI14 correspond to the expressions given by Delgado-
Inglada et al. (2014).
