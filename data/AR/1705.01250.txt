Abstract: We report the results of a characterization study of several types of cryogenic photo-
multipliers manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics and intended for operation in liquid Ar con-
ditions, namely: compact 2-inch R6041-506MOD tubes, 3-inch R11065-10 and R11065-MOD
tubes for operation in liquid Ar and 3-inch R11410-20 tubes originally designed for operation in
liquid Xe. These types of PMT are proposed for installation into the future two-phase cryogenic
avalanche detector that is developed in the Laboratory of Cosmology and Particle Physics of the
Novosibirsk State University jointly with the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics. Eight R11065
PMTs and seven R11410-20 tubes were tested and all demonstrated excellent performance in liquid
Ar in terms of gain and relative single electron eﬃciency. All 3-inch PMTs showed a maximal
gain in liquid Ar above 5x106 and relative single electron eﬃciency higher than 95%. Compact
R6041-506MOD tubes have dynode system diﬀerent from that of the 3-inch photomultipliers and
thus their single electron energy resolution and relative eﬃciency is much worse than that of 3-inch
tubes. From 21 2-inch PMTs only 12 tubes were selected with acceptable, i.e. higher than 75%,
relative single electron eﬃciency and the maximal gain higher than 5x106. However, these PMTs
are very attractive because they are the only compact type of tubes that can operate in liquid Ar.

Keywords: Photon detectors for UV, visible and IR photons (vacuum) (photomultipliers, HPDs,
others), Cryogenic detectors, Dark Matter detectors (WIMPs, axions, etc.)

Two-phase Cryogenic Avalanche Detector (CRAD) is proposed and being developed in the Labora-
tory of Cosmology and Particle Physics of the Novosibirsk State University jointly with the Budker
Institute of Nuclear Physics [1–5]. The main purpose of this detector is to search for weakly inter-
acting massive particles (WIMP) [6] and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering [7, 8] by detecting
signals from nuclear recoils [9]. The energy of recoil nuclei from WIMP is predicted not to exceed
several tens of keV with the most interesting range below 8 keV that corresponds to the WIMP mass
below 10 GeV. For coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering the recoil energy is even lower, below 0.5
keV. Thus the CRAD sensitivity that can allow detection of single primary electrons becomes a
factor of crucial importance.

The design of proposed CRAD is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The detector consists of a
cryogenic vessel with a vacuum thermal insulation that can hold up to 150 l of liquid Ar (200 kg).
The sensitive volume is limited by the height of the bottom PMT system as well as the thickness
of side PMTs and is close to 50 l (50 cm in height and 36 cm in diameter). Primary electrons,
produced by recoil nuclei after WIMP or neutrino scattering, drift in the liquid towards the surface
in the electric ﬁeld of 2 kV/cm. At the liquid surface electrons are emitted in the gas phase where
they produce signal in two stages: ﬁrst by electroluminescence in the high electric ﬁeld above the
liquid and second by avalanche multiplication in a double-THGEM or in a hybrid 2THGEM/GEM
cascade.

Proportional scintillations in the VUV region from an electroluminescence (EL) gap (S2 signal)
are detected by the ring of side PMT and by the bottom PMT system. To provide sensitivity in
the VUV range all PMTs have a wavelength shifter (tetraphenyl-butadiene, TPB) deposited either
directly on the PMT window or on a thin transparent plastic foil in front of them. The bottom PMTs
are also intended for the detection of primary scintillations in the liquid (S1 signal).

Figure 1. Design of two-phase CRAD in Ar with optical readout by a combined GEM/GAPD multiplier.

For the bottom PMT system an R11065 Hamamatsu 3-inch PMT was chosen based on the
experience of WArP and DarkSide experiments [10, 11]. This PMT has a bialkali photocathode
adapted for operation down to liquid Ar temperature (87 K). The quantum eﬃciency (QE) reported
by the manufacturer is not less than 25% at 420 nm. The authors of
[10] report, however, the
value of 33% QE at 420 nm. For the side PMT system the Hamamatsu R6041-506MOD device
was chosen. This is a compact 2-inch PMT with a metal-channel dynode structure and a bialkali
photocathode adapted for operation in liquid Ar (87 K) with 25% QE at 420 nm [12]. This tube has
57 mm diameter and 43.5 mm height, which allows to keep the diameter of the sensitive volume
not less than 36 cm.

The TPB layer considerably reduces a photon collection eﬃciency, by a factor reaching 20, due
to internal reﬂection and conversion eﬃciency losses in the wavelength shifter (WLS) and because
of the absence of optical contact between the WLS and the PMT window. Thus, it looks attractive
to shift the VUV emission of Ar to a longer wavelength directly in the detection medium without
the WLS. It is known that in liquid Ar such a VUV-to-UV conversion can be performed by doping
with Xe, at a content of 10-1000 ppm (see [13] and references therein). For this case we propose
here to use a 3-inch R11410 PMT in liquid Ar conditions, originally designed for use in liquid Xe
[14–17]. This PMT has an enhanced sensitivity to UV photons emitted by Xe, with a quantum
eﬃciency close to 30% at 175 nm (Fig. 2) [18]). On the other hand, it has the same dynode system,
the same body and the similar bialkali photocathode as those of R11065, which give hope for a

successful operation at liquid Ar temperature.

Another motivation for testing an R11410 PMT in liquid Ar conditions comes from the idea
of the "universal argon-xenon detector". In this idea, the detector designed for operation in liquid
Xe, in particular that of the RED experiment [17], can also be operated with liquid Ar using the
same PMT system, thus diversifying the target material.

2 Experimental set-up and conditions of the measurements

In our previous work excellent performance of the R11065-10 and R11065-MOD PTMs in liquid
Ar was demonstrated [19] and these results are presented here for completeness. The total number
of compact R6041-506MOD PMTs purchased from Hamamatsu Photonics is 21 pieces. The results
of the performance of four PMTs were reported in [19]. In the present work the rest 17 PMTs are
tested. Seven 3-inch R11410-20 PMTs are tested in the present work and for the ﬁrst time their
successful operation in liquid Ar is demonstrated. The image of R6041-506MOD and R11410-20
PMTs is shown in Fig. 3. The set-up for testing of PMT immersed in liquid Ar is presented in
Fig. 4. For the tests of PMT we used a stainless steel vessel 30 cm in diameter and 40 cm high
with a gas-tight top cover. The vessel can keep up to 3 atm of overpressure. The top cover contains
three metal-glass feedthroughs that were used to provide high voltage to the PMT under test, signal
from the pulse generator to the light emission diode (LED), signals from the temperature sensors
to the Lake Shore 336 temperature controller and voltage to the heater from the same controller.
Cryocooler Cryodyne 350CP by CTI-Cryogenics was used for cooling and liquefaction of Ar. The
PMT under test was installed inside a thermal insulating cylindrical case 10 cm in diameter and 35
cm high. The case has a plastic PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottle 8 cm in diameter and 30
cm high ﬁrmly attached inside. At the bottom the bottle has special support containing the LED for
PMT cathode illumination.

Figure 4. Schematic set-up for the PMT tests.

All three types of PMTs, R11065, R11410-20 and R6041-506MOD were powered by positive
voltage from N1470 CAEN high voltage power supply. A signal from the PMT anode was ampliﬁed
by a factor of 10 or 100 with a CAEN N979 fast linear ampliﬁer module. Then ampliﬁed signal was
connected to a Tektronix TDS5034B oscilloscope and to a discriminator CAEN N841 for counting
rate measurements by a scaler CAEN N1145. The oscilloscope was used for the measurements of
waveforms and pulse height spectra. Signals were obtained from spontaneous emission of single
electrons from photocathode or by illumination with the LED. The LED was powered from a pulse
generator, and its light intensity could be tuned by changing a pulse height and base line from the

– 4 –

generator. The rate with LED did not exceed 5 kHz and the frequency of the pulse generator was
50 kHz.

3 Results of the measurements

3.1 R11065-10, R11065-MOD

Single electron response (SER) of an R11065 tube is rather fast, FWHM of the signal is 7 ns
and full width at 0.1 maximum is around 12 ns. The gain can reach values close to 107 and the
single electron spectrum is very well separated from the noise (see Fig. 5). The gain of the PMT
was calculated from the measurements of the pulse height spectra of SER. At ﬁrst the waveform
was measured for each PMT: by integrating it and expressing the total charge in electrons, the
relationship between the full charge and the pulse height was calculated. Then the pulse height
spectra were measured and the most probable pulse height was found for each spectrum by ﬁtting
with the Gaussian distribution. The pulse height distribution of SER in PMT in the absence of
external noise sources is mainly determined by multiplication statistics of the ﬁrst dynode that is
well described by the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution with the average value from 7
to 9 (see [19]) is very close to that of the Gaussian. Moreover, the rest dynodes and electronic noise
smear the ﬁnal distribution following in average the Gaussian law. A gain as a function of anode

voltage is shown in Fig. 6 for three typical photomultipliers. A relative single electron eﬃciency
(fraction of the SE response spectrum above threshold) reaches 95% at the gain below 5x106 for all
photomultipliers (Fig. 7).

3.2 R6041-506MOD

This PMT is about twice slower than R11065: FWHM of the waveform is 14 ns and the width at
0.1 of maximum is about 20 ns. As R6041-506MOD is a slower PMT as compared to R11065,
it has an approximately twice lower average SE signal at the same gain. A typical SE response
spectrum is shown in Fig. 8. As in the case of R11065, linear dependence between the pulse height
and total charge was used to calculate the gain. Since there was signiﬁcant asymmetry of the SER
spectrum, the Poisson distribution convolved with the Gaussian function was used for the signal
spectrum approximation. The convolution allowed to account for the distribution smear due to the
second- and higher-order dynodes and external noises. To account for the discriminator used as
the trigger for the data collection, the signal model curve was multiplied by a steplike function
with a narrow slope. Also the noise spectrum measured at zero voltage was added to the ﬁtting
curve of the SER spectrum. This noise was mainly caused by the electronics and was normally
stable during the measurement runs and independent of anode voltage. The average pulse height
was calculated from the ﬁtted signal curve without considering discriminator cut oﬀ. The gain of

R6041-506MOD can reach 107, however, these tubes have rather large spread of maximum gain
and relative SE eﬃciency. Only eight photomultipliers with relative SE eﬃciency higher than 75%
could be selected (Fig. 9). In total only 12 PMTs out of 21 were selected for future operation in the
two-phase CRAD.

3.3 R11410-20

Performance of these photomultipliers is very similar to that of R11065 tubes. As we did not
know whether these tubes could operate without discharges in liquid Ar , the voltage was gradualy
increased from 1000 V to 1500 V (recommended maximum voltage by the manufacturer). Four
of the seven tested photomultipliers reached maximum voltage without discharges operating in
liquid Ar. The other three PMTs exhibit discharges at the anode voltage between 1300 V and

1375 V corresonding to the gain values around 3x106. After the discharges all parameters of the
photomultipliers were recovered and anode voltage was kept below 1300 V. The pulse shape and
the pulse height spectra of R11410-20 tubes look very much like that of R11065. Spread of gains,
energy resolutions and relative eﬃciencies is rather small, unlike in the case of R6041-506MOD
tubes. Typical gain-voltage curves and relative eﬃciency vs gain dependencies are shown in Fig. 10
and Fig. 11. All seven tested photomultipliers demonstrated relative eﬃciency above 95% in liquid
Ar.

3.4 Long-term performance of the cryogenic PMTs.

The behavior of one R6041-506MOD and one R11410-20 PMTs immersed in liquid argon for the
period of several hours was studied. None of the gain, noise frequency or signal shape showed
signiﬁcant change for both tubes during the runs. Figure 12 shows gain vs time dependences for the
R6041-506MOD tube and for R11410-20 photomultiplier. In both cases anode voltage was applied
constantly during the whole run.

4 Conclusions

Operation of three types of the cryogenic PMT produced by Hamamatsu Photonics was tested in
liquid Ar, namely 3-inch R11065-10 and R11065-MOD tubes, 2-inch compact R6041-506MOD
tubes and 3-inch R11410-20 tubes sensitive to Xe UV emission. R11065 photomultipliers are
designed for operation in liquid Ar. They demonstrate excellent performance, stable operation with

maximum gain reaching 107 and relative eﬃciency for single electrons higher than 95%. 2-inch
R6041-506MOD tubes are very attractive due to their compact design, however their gain and
relative eﬃciency exhibit high spread and only 12 photomultipliers out of 21 were selected with
relative SER eﬃciency higher than 75% for operation in future two-phase CRAD. R11410-20 tubes
were designed for operation in liquid Xe and this work was the ﬁrst demonstration of their operation
in liquid Ar. These photomultipliers can safely operate at 87◦K with a maximum gain up to 107
and relative SER eﬃciency higher than 95%.
