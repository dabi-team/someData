TIME-VARIABLE ALUMINUM ABSORPTION IN THE POLAR AR URSAE MAJORIS, AND AN UPDATED
ESTIMATE FOR THE MASS OF THE WHITE DWARF

ABSTRACT
We present spectra of the extreme polar AR Ursae Majoris (AR UMa) which display a clear Al I
absorption doublet, alongside spectra taken less than a year earlier in which that feature is not present.
Re-examination of earlier SDSS spectra indicates that the Al I absorption doublet was also present ≈8
years before our ﬁrst non-detection. We conclude that this absorbing material is unlikely to be on the
surface of either the white dwarf (WD) or the donor star. We suggest that this Al I absorption feature
arises in circumstellar material, perhaps produced by the evaporation of asteroids as they approach
the hot WD. The presence of any remaining reservoir of rocky material in AR UMa might help to
constrain the prior evolution of this unusual binary system. We also apply spectral decomposition to
ﬁnd the stellar parameters of the M dwarf companion, and attempt to dynamically measure the mass
of the WD in AR UMa by considering both the radial velocity curves of the Hβ emission line and the
Na I absorption line. Thereby we infer a mass range for the WD in AR UMa of 0.91 M⊙ < MWD <
1.24 M⊙.

1. INTRODUCTION
The polar AR UMa is inferred to contain a white dwarf
(WD) that possesses a magnetic ﬁeld of ∼240 MG –
the strongest of the known polars (Schmidt et al. 1996;
G¨ansicke et al. 2001). Its optical observations show that
it often changes between high and low brightness states,
remaining in the low state for approximately 90% of the
time. During the low state, ellipsoidal variations reveal
an orbital period of 1.932 hr (Remillard et al. 1994), and
both the WD and the M dwarf (MD) donor star can be
detected from optical spectra.

Here we report the detection of a time-variable alu-
minum absorption line in spectra of AR UMa. We con-
clude that the line probably originates from circumstel-
lar material around the WD, and tentatively suggest that
the most likely origin of this material is from evaporation
of infalling asteroids.

Similar scenarios have been examined in recent years,
with both observational evidence and theoretical stud-
ies ﬁnding that tidal disruption and evaporation of
rocky asteroids can account for circumstellar mate-
rial around WDs (Lallement et al. 2011; Debes et al.
2012a; Perez-Becker & Chiang 2013; Veras et al. 2014,
2015; Vanderburg et al. 2015). This suggests that reser-
voirs of asteroids, comets, and planets/planetisimals
may exist in wide orbits around some WDs.
If so,
their orbits could occasionally become suﬃciently un-
stable or elliptical that they are disrupted as they ap-
proach the WD (Frewen & Hansen 2014; Stone et al.
2015; Veras et al. 2015). Rocky debris may also be
evaporated by the hot radiation from a WD into cir-
cumstellar gas, from which heavy element absorption

lines can originate (Lallement et al. 2011; Debes et al.
2012a; Dickinson et al. 2012; Perez-Becker & Chiang
2013). Such scenarios may also explain the features of
non-degenerate stars – notably β Pictoris, a star with a
well-established debris disk (see, e.g., Beust et al. 1990,
1996; Karmann et al. 2003). Material from an evapo-
rating rocky planet may explain photometric variations
in Kepler observations of the K dwarf KIC 12557548
(Rappaport et al. 2012).

Our detection was serendipitous. Despite being a very
well-known and extreme system, the basic parameters
of the stellar components in AR UMa are poorly con-
strained. The emission lines from the heated inner hemi-
sphere of the MD are a poor tracer of the barycenter
of the MD, and thus have not enabled precise dynam-
ical mass measurements. Using the Hα emission line,
Schmidt et al. (1999) estimated the mass of the WD as
0.4 ≤ MWD ≤ 1.0 M⊙. This observing campaign was ini-
tially intended to measure the system parameters by tak-
ing advantage of the absorption lines from the MD, such
as Na I, which are more isotropically distributed over the
photosphere of the MD (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2007).
Our observations of AR UMa and our updated orbital
ephemeris are brieﬂy described in Section 2, the detection
of aluminum absorption lines is presented in Section 3,
and our new constraints on the system masses and geom-
etry are given in Section 4. Section 5 features potential
explanations for the origin of the aluminum absorption
lines. A summary is given in Section 6.

2. OBSERVATIONS & BASIC ORBITAL

PARAMETERS
Optical spectra of AR UMa were obtained with the
Double Spectrograph (DBSP) at the Palomar Observa-
tory. The dichroic D55, which splits light into blue and
red channels around 5500 ˚A, was used with two 1200 line
mm−1 gratings blazed at 5000 and 9400 ˚A, respectively.

After each exposure of AR UMa, two exposures each of
FeAr (blue channel) and HeArNe (red channel) lamps
were taken to minimize the systemic uncertainty in the
wavelength calibration. The standard stars Hilter 600
and Hz 44 were observed before and after the exposures
of AR UMa. All observations are summarized in Table 1.
The spectra were reduced in a standard way using
IRAF procedures. After bias subtraction and ﬂat cor-
rection, the one-dimensional (1D) spectra were extracted
with an aperture size of 10 pixels. The wavelength cal-
ibration of each exposure was carried out using the ad-
jacent arc lamp exposures. Those 1D spectra were then
corrected for atmospheric extinction, and ﬂux-calibrated
using the exposures of the standard stars.

2.1. Updated Orbital Ephemeris
The Hβ emission line is the strongest feature in
all of our 16 observations. After barycenter correc-
tion, we used a Gaussian function plus a parabola
(Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2007) to ﬁt the Hβ emission
line and ﬁnd its radial velocity (and error) in each obser-
vation. These values are presented in Table 2. Assuming
a circular orbit (Howell et al. 2001), we then ﬁtted a sine
curve to the radial velocities, keeping the period ﬁxed to
0.08050074(12) day (Schmidt et al. 1999) and iteratively
minimizing χ2. The best solution has a radial velocity
amplitude of K = 245 ± 4 km s−1and a systemic velocity
of γ = 36 ± 5 km s−1(quoting 90% uncertainties).

From this best-ﬁt curve, we took ﬁve instances
of positive zero-crossing of the radial velocity curve,
HJD (2456000 +) 363.641, 363.721, 363.802, 363.882,
363.963 with an uncertainty of 0.008 days. Combining
this with the seven instances of positive zero-crossing
in Schmidt et al. (1999), we derive a best-ﬁt orbital
ephemeris of

HJD = 2450470.4314(4) + 0.080500634(8)E.

Fitting our Hβ emission line radial velocities again
using this updated orbital period ﬁnds K = 248 ± 4
km s−1and γ = 34 ± 5 km s−1(see Table 3). We also
ﬁtted the Ca II triplet with the same procedure as Hβ,

3. ALUMINUM ABSORPTION DOUBLET
The Al I λλ 3944.01,3961.52 doublet is present in the
spectra from 2013 March. We ﬁt this doublet with a
double-Gaussian function of a ﬁxed separation plus a
parabola to measure the radial velocity and error of the
Al I doublet (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2007; see the mid-
dle and right panels in Figure 1). The results of this ﬁt-
ting are presented in Table 2. We also attempted to ﬁt

the radial velocity curve of this Al I doublet with a sine
function ﬁxed to the binary period of 1.932 hr, but the
results were unacceptable (with the χ2 roughly 10 times
higher than that for the free-period ﬁt). The best-ﬁtting
parameters for an unconstrained period are listed in Ta-
ble 3, and the radial velocity curve is shown in Figure 2.
The total duration over which the relevant spectra were
taken (on 2012 March 3) was only ≈8 hr, so we do not
at all claim that this ﬁtted period is deﬁnitive, or even
that we have found evidence of any periodicity in the Al I

doublet velocities.3

The best-ﬁt systemic velocity (γ) for the Al I doublet
is clearly inconsistent with the systemic velocity for the
Hβ emission lines. By itself, this is not necessarily a
strong constraint on the location of the absorbing ma-
terial within the system, since γ-velocities for polars are
known to suﬀer from complications which are not seen in
the population of non-magnetic CVs (van Paradijs et al.
1996). Nonetheless, this result is consistent with our
later conclusion that the absorbing material is probably
circumstellar.

We are conﬁdent that this Al I doublet is unlikely of
telluric origin or an artifact of the telescope system, nor
is it from the foreground interstellar medium, since the
dispersion is about 300 km s−1. Moreover, we suggest
it is not from the MD, since the radial velocity ampli-
tude and period are inconsistent with those of the Na I

3 However, we note that Kalomeni (2012) found evidence for a
≈7.9 hour period in AR UMa by examining light variations over 11
years. This is broadly similar to that of our best ﬁt to the radial
velocity variation in the Al I doublet, although we stress that our
data so far are insuﬃcient to claim detection of a true periodicity.

absorption line from the MD (see the following section).
That Al I λλ 3944.01,3961.52 doublet is not detected in
the spectra from 2012 May. Unfortunately, there is no
coverage of this region in our spectra on HJD 2456008.
So any inference of qualitative time variability – disap-
pearance and reappearance – rests on upper limits de-
rived for only two spectra from HJD 2456065 (see Fig-
ure 1 and Table 2); one of those shows very weak hints
of a doublet by eye, but our ﬁtting indicates an upper
limit that is well below the later detections. The simplest
interpretation is that the column density of aluminum in
absorption changed between our 2012 and 2013 observa-
tions.

An alternative option to consider is that during the
time of the 2012 May observations we are just not seeing
the aluminum absorption. However, these spectra were
taken at orbital phases of 0.54 and 0.63, and the spec-
trum taken at HJD of 363.683 was at an orbital phase
of 0.53, which suggests that the disappearance of the
aluminum absorption is not a simple function of orbital
phase. The 10 spectra from HJD 363 are spread across
all of the orbit, and the Al absorption lines are clearly
detected in all of them.

We also ﬁnd that these Al I absorption lines were de-
tected in an SDSS spectrum of AR UMa from 2004
February (Julian day 2453061.4). If our observations are
robust then any model for these lines needs to explain
the disappearance of aluminum features over less than
8.2 years, and their reappearance in less than a year,
with no obvious dependence on orbital phase.

We have not detected other metal absorption lines from
our spectra. However, if they are present, some might
perhaps have been disguised by the emission lines from
the MD (e.g., Mg I and Ca II). Here we re-examine the
far-ultraviolet spectra in G¨ansicke et al. 2001, and ﬁt the
strongest metal absorption line of Si II with a Gaussian
function plus a line. The result shows that the FWHM is
240 ± 80 km s−1, which is similar to that of the aluminum
absorption doublet.

4. STELLAR PARAMETERS
AR UMa was in a low brightness state during our ob-
servations, since the molecular band from the MD was
obviously presented and the continuum ﬂux was simi-
lar to that during the low brightness state observed by
Schmidt et al. (1996). It was also probably in a low ac-
cretion state, since the He II emission line was detected
in only one observation, and only with a signal-to-noise
ratio below 3, which suggests that the accretion rate is
minimal (Szkody et al. 1999). In the low state, the emis-
sion lines are thought to originate from the inner hemi-
sphere of the MD, rather than the directed stream ﬂow
(Schmidt et al. 1999).

These low-state observations enable us to trace the ra-
dial velocity of the MD, and further constrain the mass of
the WD with the mass and the radial velocity amplitude
of the MD.

4.1. Mass of the WD
The emission lines of AR UMa originate from the hemi-
sphere of the MD facing the WD, so their velocities’ am-
plitudes should be smaller than that of the MD barycen-
ter (Schmidt et al. 1999). In AR UMa, the photospheric

Figure 5. Constraints on the geometry of AR UMa. Only the
small shaded region is allowed when combining multiple published
constraints. The dashed red vertical line marks i = 75◦, and the
solid red vertical lines mark i = 71◦and 57◦. The black solid and
blue dashed curves represent constraints inferred from the polar-
ization data, as described in Schmidt et al. 1999.

Na I λλ 8183.26,8194.81 doublet is more isotropically dis-
tributed over the MD (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2007;
Schwope et al. 2011). This is detected in spectra from
the red channel in four of the 2012 observations. We ﬁt
the doublet with a double-Gaussian function of a ﬁxed
separation plus a parabola to measure the radial velocity
and error (the left panel in Figure 1). We then ﬁt the
velocity curve of Na I with a sine function, keeping γ and
P ﬁxed to the values derived from the radial velocity of
Hβ and the updated orbital ephemeris. The radial veloc-
ity amplitude derived from the best ﬁtting is K = 409 ±
26 km s−1(Figure 3), i.e., higher than for the Hβ lines, as
expected.

We thereby estimate the mass of the MD to 0.154
M⊙ from the semi-empirical relation for CVs (see
Knigge et al. 2011). This semi-empirical relation is typ-
ically taken to have an expected uncertainty below 2%
(Knigge et al. 2011), although the extreme nature of AR
UMa might plausibly make this estimate less reliable
than for normal, non-magnetic CVs.

Since no eclipse is seen from AR UMa, the inclination
angle i should be smaller than 75◦(Schmidt et al. 1999),
which constrains the mass of the WD to MWD > 0.87
M⊙. Harrison & Campbell (2015) found a best-ﬁt incli-
nation for AR UMa of 65◦, which would correspond to
a WD mass of 1.01+0.16
−0.14 M⊙. The uncertainty adopted
here is calculated from the 90% uncertainty of the Na I
amplitude. This should not be treated as giving real up-
per and lower limits, since no uncertainty is included for
the model-ﬁt inclination angle.

Since we expect that the barycenter of the irradiated
Hβ emission area should be located between the inner
Lagrange point (L1) of the binary and the barycenter
of the MD, this may help to constrain the mass of the
WD. We ﬁrst compute the ratio of the radial velocity
amplitudes for the L1 point and the MD barycenter (i.e.,
KL1/KMD) as a function of the mass of the WD (assum-
ing the MD mass found above), as plotted in the right
panel of Figure 4. Our ﬁts to the observed radial veloc-
ity data lead to an amplitude ratio (KHβ/KNa) of 0.606
± 0.057, where the quoted uncertainty range conserva-
tively adopts 3σ uncertainties in both the radial velocity
amplitudes. The upper end of that range of statistical
uncertainty corresponds to an upper limit on the WD
mass of MWD < 1.24 M⊙, corresponding to an inclina-
tion angle of 57◦.

This excludes a possible source of systematic uncer-
tainty, since the Na I λλ 8183.26,8194.81 doublet may
trace the outer hemisphere of the MD, i.e., be biased
toward the side away from the L1 point. Nonetheless we
still feel that this is probably a fairly conservative limit,
as it assumes that the Hβ lines trace the L1 point.

Combining this limit with the lower limit from taking

(black circles). Bottom: the residual to the ﬁts (black line). Regions in which polarization is expected to aﬀect the spectral features are
indicated by the gray shaded zones.

i < 75◦ produces an estimate for the mass range of the
WD in AR UMa of 0.87 M⊙ < MWD < 1.24 M⊙.

4.2. System Geometry
Schmidt et al. 1999 estimated the possible ranges of
the inclination angle i and the colatitude of the magnetic
pole δ using constraints calculated from photospheric cir-
cular polarization. Combining their results with ours
(K = 409 ± 26 km s−1, 0.87 M⊙ < MWD < 1.24 M⊙),
we update their constraints on i and δ to
57◦ < i < 71◦, 10◦ < δ < 16◦,

(2)

In turn, this lower upper limit on i slightly increases the
minimum inferred mass of the WD; the allowed region in
Figure 5 yields a WD mass range of 0.91 M⊙ < MWD <
1.24 M⊙.

Such system geometry (67◦< i+ δ < 87◦) would imply
that one hotspot around the magnetic pole of AR UMa
is always visible.

4.3. Spectral Decomposition
We also constructed two-component (blue and red)
models based on WD and MD templates to ﬁt our ob-
served spectra. Since the Balmer absorption lines of the
WD were undetected in the blue component of AR UMa,
a series of blackbody spectra were used as WD templates.
We also note that Schmidt et al. (1996) previously sug-
gested that the blue component contained contributions
from both the inner hemisphere of the MD and the atmo-
sphere of the WD. For the MD templates, we adopt the
Phoenix library of synthetic spectra (Husser et al. 2013).
The model space therefore covers a WD parameter Tbb
and MD parameters Teﬀ, log g, and [Fe/H]. The rele-
vant ranges in the parameter space are: WD blackbody
temperature 10 kK ≤ Tbb≤ 50 kK (step size 0.1 kK);

eﬀective temperature 2300 K ≤ Teﬀ≤ 3400 K (step size
100 K); surface gravity 0.0 ≤ log g ≤ 6.0 (every 0.5 dex);
metallicity −4.0 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ 1.0 (every 0.5 dex).

Since

limited coverage, we
spectra have
used the SDSS spectrum of AR UMa
(SDSS
J111544.56+425822.4) and minimized the χ2 pa-
rameter to ﬁt the spectrum in a four-dimensional
parameter space, after masking all of the emission
lines in the spectrum. The spectrum is reproduced at
each point in the parameter space by a combination
of a blackbody and a MD. They are then weighted
with scaling factors that depend on the distance and
the radii. The ﬁtted spectrum (Figure 6) gives Tbb =
46300 K, Teﬀ = 3200 K, log g = 5.0 and [Fe/H] = 1.0.
The half widths of the parameters are adopted as the
uncertainties (Liu et al. 2012), which are 50 K for Tbb
and Teﬀ, 0.3 dex for log g and 0.3 dex for [Fe/H].

The inferred temperature and gravity of the MD are
consistent with those calculated from the semi-empirical
relations of CVs (Teﬀ ≃ 3180 K and log g ≃ 5.1).

However, the ﬁtted blackbody temperature is much
higher than previously estimated for the WD in AR
UMa; for example, G¨ansicke et al. 2001, estimated a WD
temperature of 20, 000±5000 when including information
from ultraviolet HST spectra of AR UMa.

The scaling factors enable us to obtain the radius of the
MD and the eﬀective radius of this blackbody component
(assuming a spherical emission surface). To do this we
adopt the distance of AR UMa, 86 (+10, −8) pc, mea-
sured from its parallax (Thorstensen et al. 2008). The
derived radii are 0.15 ± 0.02 R⊙ for the MD, and 0.0034
± 0.0004 R⊙ for the blue component. The radius of a
non-magnetic WD with 1.01 M⊙ is in the range of 0.0074
< RWD < 0.0084 R⊙, taking eﬀective temperatures be-
tween 10000 K and 40000 K from non-magnetic DA

 
 
WD models (Holberg & Bergeron 2006; Tremblay et al.
2011)4. Assuming a strong internal magnetic ﬁeld for
the WD in AR UMa would increase the expected radius
(Suh & Mathews 2000), so the emission area of the ﬁt-
ted blue component is too small to cover the complete
surface of the WD (unless the WD is substantially more
massive than we have inferred).

The inferred radius of the MD is smaller than that
estimated using the semi-empirical relation for CVs, R
≃ 0.19 R⊙. This underestimate seems consistent with
the red component of the continuum being dominated
by the outer hemisphere of the MD.

In Figure 6, the residuals from the ﬁtting show features
that clearly deviate from the synthetic model. Some
of these are due to the polarizing eﬀect of the strong
magnetic ﬁeld (Schmidt et al. 1996; Ferrario et al. 2003).
The deviation around 8200˚A is due to the variability of
the Na I line proﬁle (Figure 1), and the continuum around
Ca II triplet may be due to the unresolved Paschen emis-
sion lines.

5. DISCUSSION
We have detected an aluminum absorption feature in
spectra of AR UMa, during the probable low brightness
and accretion states. The apparent sub-year time vari-
ability of the feature is especially intriguing. Here we
discuss potential origins of the aluminum absorption.

5.1. Interpreting the Al I doublet as from circumstellar

material

Since the radial velocity of the Al I doublet is incon-
sistent with that of the MD, the aluminum is unlikely
to be located on the surface of the MD. G¨ansicke et al.
2001 detected a P Cygni proﬁle for Lyα emission, sug-
gesting the existence of a moderately fast wind, about
−700 km s−1, from the MD, which is also inconsistent
with the velocity of the Al I doublet.

Another argument against the aluminum being located
on the donor star is the sub-year timescale over which we
see the feature changing, given that the variation does
not seem to be due to orbital changes (see Section 3).
This is not a natural timescale for variations in the com-
position of the MD atmosphere.

The / 8 year timescale for disappearance of the alu-
minum feature could be easily explained by gravitational
settling in the atmosphere of the WD. The reappearance
of the aluminum in less than a year might also be nat-
urally explained by pollution of the WD. Recent years
have seen great interest in studying WDs with atmo-
spheric heavy elements, especially because these heavy
elements may have been delivered by the accretion of
rocky material from a disrupted planet, debris disk,
or asteroids (Zuckerman et al. 2007, 2011; Dufour et al.
2010, 2012; Pyrzas et al. 2012). Previous observations
have indicated time variation in such accretion onto
some isolated WDs, perhaps due to a transient gaseous
disk (Wilson et al. 2014) or precession of the debris disk
(Manser et al. 2015).

An alternative explanation for the presence of atmo-
spheric heavy elements in suitably hot WDs is radiative
levitation (see, e.g., Chayer et al. 1995). If the observed

variability had been due to the changing eﬀect of radia-
tive levitation on the WD, this might have suggested that
the eﬀect was rather sensitively balanced on the WD in
AR UMa.

However, the proﬁle of the Al I doublet strongly argues
against the absorption feature being from the surface of
the highly magnetic WD in AR UMa. All the spectral
features from the atmosphere of the WD should be split
into wide ranges of wavelength and be barely recogniz-
able (Kepler et al. 2013) for AR UMa. Assuming a dipole
magnetic ﬁeld with a strength of ∼ 240 MG at the poles
gives a ﬁeld strength of ∼80−120 MG at the equator
(Martin & Wickramasinghe 1984; G¨ansicke et al. 2001).
We consider it highly unlikely that a suﬃciently large
patch of the WD surface would have low enough mag-
netic ﬁeld strength for the Al I doublet to be so clearly
seen with no Zeeman splitting. We also note that our
attempts to ﬁt the Al I absorption line with a radial ve-
locity curve did not produce anything consistent with
that expected for the WD. Overall, we consider the lack
of magnetic distortion in the lines from the Al I doublet
to be convincing evidence that the lines are not formed
on the surface of the WD.

Given the above, the two remaining possibilities are
interstellar or circumstellar absorption. Based on the
observed variability, we suggest that the absorption is
unlikely to be interstellar. So we conclude that the ab-
sorption features probably have a circumstellar origin.

G¨ansicke et al. (2001) found weak low-ionization lines
in their FUV spectrum of AR UMa, which they inter-
preted as likely being due to the absorption of the local
interstellar medium. Perhaps the Al I absorption doublet
is from similar material as provided the origin for those
low-ionization lines, in which case G¨ansicke et al. (2001)
also detected such circumstellar gas.

5.2. A rocky origin for the circumstellar material?
Assuming we have detected circumstellar gas in AR
UMa, we now discuss the likely origin of that material.
Circumstellar gas around WDs has previously been re-
ported in four systems: WD 1040+492, WD 1942+499,
WD 2257+073 and WD 1124−293 (Lallement et al.
2011; Debes et al. 2012a). An anti-correlation is derived
between the eﬀective temperature of the WD and the or-
bital velocity of the gas around the WDs, which is consis-
tent with the orbiting gas material originating from the

8

evaporation of planets or asteroids.

Additional evidence for such a scenario follows from
several transit events of planets discovered from the light
curve of WD 1145+017 (Vanderburg et al. 2015). The
varying transit depths and their asymmetric proﬁles in-
dicate a planet with a comet-like tail from evaporation.
The tail, consisting of various heavy elements, would es-
cape into the orbit through a Parker-type thermal wind
(Rappaport et al. 2014; Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2015).
In
that case the tail also contaminates the atmosphere of
WD 1145+017.

If the inferred circumstellar gas in AR UMa did origi-
nate from the evaporation of a rocky body, measuring the
mass-loss ﬂux might help to constrain the characteristics
of the body evaporation (see especially Rappaport et al.
2012; Perez-Becker & Chiang 2013).

We can estimate the column density of Al I in 2013 May
12 by taking the center-corrected spectra from those ob-
servations and ﬁtting the doublet with VPFIT (Figure 7,
Carswell & Webb 2014). The best-ﬁtting column den-
sity is N (Al I) = 3.9 ± 0.2 × 1013 cm−2. Unfortunately,
the spacing of our observations does not suﬃciently con-
strain the timescale of evaporation to provide a useful
estimate of the mass-loss ﬂux.

We estimate that the region in which an aluminum-
rich rock would be expected to sublimate is much larger
than the volume in which Zeeman splitting would have
been detected in our low-resolution spectra (correspond-
ing to a ﬁeld strength of roughly 2MG, and a distance
from the WD of ≈ 0.05R⊙). Taking a sublimation tem-
perature for Corundum (Al2O3) of 1500K, we ﬁnd that
the equilibrium temperature caused by heating from the
WD would exceed this value within ≈ 1.6R⊙ from the
WD. This is very similar to the major axis of the orbit of
the MD. Moreover, this is comparable to the separation
at which the WD would tidally disrupt such an asteroid
(assuming a density of 4.02 g cm−3 for Corundum); for
asteroids with lower density, tidal disruption would likely
begin before evaporation (see, e.g., Veras et al. 2014).

We note that the relative radial velocity of the ﬁt-
ted Al I doublet to the AR UMa binary system is ≈ 27
km s−1, which is consistent with circumstellar gas de-
tected around other WDs (Lallement et al. 2011).

We do not claim that it is inevitable that this inter-
pretation of circumstellar aluminum demands a rocky
origin. An alternative possibility might be related to
a proposed explanation for the known CVs with supra-
solar photospheric abundances of aluminum (Sion et al.
2001; G¨ansicke et al. 2005; Jos´e et al. 2006). Some mod-
els for those CVs indicate that aluminum was likely
generated in nova outbursts on the WD, and further-
more that the aluminum-enriched nova ejecta might have
been captured by the donor star and re-accreted onto
to the WD (Marks & Sarna 1998; Sengupta et al. 2013;
Sion & Sparks 2014). If our interpretation that the alu-
minum in AR UMa is circumstellar is correct, then it
might perhaps be explained by a variation of that model,

if some of the nova ejecta can remain within the system.
However, it is less obvious to us how the time variation
we observe might be naturally explained in this model.
So a tentative potential explanation for the origin of
this circumstellar gas is that AR UMa possesses an ex-
trasolar analog to the Oort cloud (Stone et al. 2015) or
the Kuiper Belt (Bonsor et al. 2011) containing some
Al-rich rocks. The orbits of those rocks might become
destabilized due to perturbation of the binary motion or
dynamical interaction with other planets in the system
(Debes et al. 2012b; Frewen & Hansen 2014), after which
they approach so close to the WD as to be evaporated,
resulting in circumstellar gas in the form of a highly ec-
centric ring (Veras et al. 2014, 2015) or spherical cloud
around the WD (Stone et al. 2015). That circumstellar
gas may accrete on to the WD with a time-scale of less
than ∼ 8.2 years due to the additional force from the
MD (Veras et al. 2014), which might explain the time-
scale over which the aluminum absorption disappears.

If this scenario is correct, more time-resolved spectra
of these lines may provide a way to probe the duty cycle
of the evaporation and further shed light on the popula-
tion of asteroids in AR UMa and their orbital instabil-
ities. Additional infrared spectroscopy might constrain
the composition of the gas by detecting molecular fea-
tures and thus investigate the character of these asteroids
(Carry 2012).

6. SUMMARY
We have detected an aluminum absorption doublet in
spectra of AR UMa, and suggest that this is evidence
for circumstellar material in this extreme polar. The
aluminum absorption feature also appears to be time-
variable, having disappeared over less than 9 years, and
then re-appeared in less than a year. Our spectra also
allowed a preliminary attempt to better-constrain the
properties of the components in AR UMa, including an
updated estimate for the WD mass in the range of 0.91
M⊙ < MWD < 1.24 M⊙.

A potential explanation for this variable aluminum ab-
sorption is irregular circumstellar gas due to evaporation
of rocky material from, e.g., asteroids destabilized from
orbits further out in the system. We encourage studies
of AR UMa with high time-resolution spectra, both to
enable deeper investigation of the origin of this absorp-
tion and to help further improve our understanding of
this extreme system.

Figure 9. Region of the spectra around λ = 8498 ˚A. The best ﬁts are shown as red solid lines for the ﬁrst line of the Ca II triplet, and
the red vertical dashed lines mark the zero-velocity positions. The heliocentric Julian dates-2456000 are given in the top right corners of
the ﬁrst 10 panels. Our best-ﬁtting radial velocity (RV) curve is shown as the blue solid line in the bottom right panel. The ﬁtted systemic
velocity (γ) and the radial velocity amplitude (K) are presented in the top right corner of the panel.
