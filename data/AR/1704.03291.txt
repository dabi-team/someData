Investigating the ”kink” plot as a signal of the
onset of deconﬁnement.

Michał Naskręt

University of Wroclaw, NA61/SHINE

Abstract

One of the physics goals of the NA61/SHINE collaboration at the
CERN Super Proton Synchrotron is to study the phase diagram of hadronic
matter. To this end, a series of heavy ion collision measurements are per-
formed. It is believed that above a certain collision energy and system
size a phase transition between hadronic matter and quark-gluon plasma
occurs. A number of observables has been developed to determine which
of the phases was created at the early stage of the collision. This report
discusses the dependence of the ratio of the mean number of produced
pions to the mean number of wounded nucleons on the Fermi energy mea-
sure. For comparison with other measurements this is often presented in
the form of the the ”kink” plot. This plot is presented enriched with pre-
liminary results for Ar+Sc central collisions at 13A, 19A, 30A, 40A, 75A
and 150A GeV/c beam momentum. The results are ﬁnally compared to
data from other experiments.

Introduction

NA61/SHINE at the CERN SPS is a ﬁxed target experiment which studies ﬁnal
hadronic states produced in interactions between various particles at diﬀerent
collision energies [1]. The search for the onset of deconﬁnement of strongly inter-
acting matter is part of the experiment’s physics program. Within the framework
of this program measurements of p+p, Be+Be, p+Pb, Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb col-
lisions were performed. In the nearest future measurements of Xe+La reactions
are planned. The measurements will greatly beneﬁt the two-dimensional sys-
tem size and collision energy scan, which will be helpful in studying the phase
transition between hadronic and deconﬁned phases.

The NA61/SHINE detector (see Fig. 1) is a large-acceptance hadron spec-
trometer located on the SPS ring at CERN. Upstream of the spectrometer are
placed scintillators, Cherenkov detectors and Beam Position Detectors. They

provide timing references and position measurements for the incoming beam
particles. About 4 meters after the target, the trigger scintillator counter S4
detects if collisions are in the target area by the absence of a beam particle
signal. The main detectors of NA61/SHINE are four large volume Time Projec-
tion Chambers used for determination of trajectories and energy loss dE/dx of
produced charged particles. The ﬁrst two – VTPC-1 and VTPC-2 are placed in
a magnetic ﬁeld to measure particles’ charge and momentum. Two large TPCs
(MTPC-L and MTPC-R) are placed downstream of the magnets. Time-of-ﬂight
measurements are performed by two ToF walls (ToF-L, ToF-R). The last part of
the setup is the Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD) – a zero-degree calorimeter
which measures the energy of projectile spectators.

2 The ”kink” plot

According to the Standard Model, quarks and gluons are elementary constituents
of hadronic matter. Interactions between them are described by quantum chro-
modynamics [2, 3]. One of the most important properties of quarks and gluons is
that in matter under normal conditions they are always enclosed within hadrons.
This is called quark conﬁnement. In order to transform matter from the hadronic
into the deconﬁned phase one needs to create high temperature and system den-
sity conditions. This can be achieved experimentally in ultra-relativistic heavy
ion collisions. A system that achieves the necessary conditions during the early
stage of the collision forms the quark-gluon plasma [4], which rapidly expands
and freezes-out. In this later stage of the collision, quarks and gluons recombine

Since the number of degrees of freedom is higher for the quark-gluon plasma
than for conﬁned matter, it is expected that the entropy density of the system
at given temperature and density should also be higher in the ﬁrst case. The
90%) produced in heavy ion collisions are π mesons.
majority of particles (
Therefore, the entropy and information regarding the state of matter formed
in the early stage of a collision should be reﬂected in the number of produced
pions normalised to the volume of the system. This intuitive argument was
quantiﬁed within the Statistical Model of the Early Stage (SMES) [5]. The
change of the mean number of produced pions
is often normalized to the
number of wounded nucleons
and plotted against the Fermi energy measure
(cid:16)
F = (cid:2)(√sNN
. As the plot resembles a linear increase with
a kink of slope in the case of nucleus-nucleus collisions, it is often referred to as
the ”kink” plot. The plot is presented in Fig. 2.

sults from Ar+Sc collisions

In order to add a new point to the ”kink” plot it is necessary to calculate the
mean number of pions produced in a collision and the mean number of wounded
nucleons. The former is extracted from experimental data. In this paper, pre-
liminary results obtained from Ar+Sc central collisions at 13A, 19A, 30A, 40A,
75A and 150A GeV/c, taken during 2015 NA61/SHINE physics data run are
discussed. The number of wounded nucleons is not measured experimentally and
has to be calculated using Monte Carlo simulations.

3.1 Calculating the mean number of produced pions

The starting point of the analysis described herein are double diﬀerential spectra

of negatively charged hadrons (see expample Fig. 3).

They were obtained from reconstructed tracks applying a series of quality
cuts. In order to correct for trigger and reconstruction ineﬃciencies, one needs
to apply a Monte Carlo correction. To this end, the EPOS MC [6] is used in
NA61/SHINE. A large statistics of particle collisions is generated and particles
are accumulated in bins ni,j
gen in transverse momentum pT versus rapidity. The
generated data undergoes the regular reconstruction procedure and negatively
charged pion selection resuling in the distribution ni,j

The NA61/SHINE experimental apparatus is characterized by large, but
limited acceptance. In order to estimate the mean π− multiplicity in the full
acceptance, one needs to extrapolate the experimental data to unmeasured re-
gions. The procedure consists of the following steps:

1. For ﬁxed y extrapolate the pT spectrum from the edge of acceptance to

pT = 2GeV /c, using the exponential form

3.2 Calculating the mean number of wounded nucleons

The number of wounded nucleons can not be measured experimentally in NA61/SHINE.
It has to be calculated using Monte Carlo models. Two models were used to per-
form calculations – Glissando 2.73 [7] based on the Glauber model and EPOS

that is consistent with previous measurements and applicable to the wounded
nucleon model [8]. EPOS, on the other hand, allows for more detailed centrality
analysis and event selection. It is possible to reproduce Glauber-based values in
EPOS and they are in good agreement with Glissando as shown in Fig. 5.

For now, the EPOS ”a la Glauber” value is used with centrality selected

ble 2. More detailed analysis of centrality is planned as a future step of the
analysis.

From the preliminary version of the ”kink” plot one can conclude that for
high SPS energies Ar+Sc follows the Pb+Pb trend. On the other hand, for
low SPS energies Ar+Sc follows the p+p tendency. The plot also conﬁrms the
low-energy enhancement of (cid:104)π(cid:105)
(cid:104)W (cid:105) measured in p+p compared to A+A collisions.
