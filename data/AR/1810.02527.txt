Cross sections of α-induced reactions slightly below doubly-magic 40Ca from the
statistical model

New experimental data for the 38Ar(α,n)41Ca and 38Ar(α,p)41K reactions were used to ﬁnd a
best-ﬁt set of parameters for statistical model calculations. The very good agreement between the
experimental data and the best-ﬁt calculation conﬁrms the applicability of the statistical model for
nuclei in the vicinity of the doubly-magic 40Ca despite of their relatively low level densities. The
present study investigates the sensitivities and ﬁnds that the α-nucleus and the nucleon-nucleus
potentials are the most important ingredients for the calculation of (α,n) and (α,p) reactions in
the statistical model. Furthermore, the width ﬂuctuation correction plays an essential role in the
peculiar case of 38Ar. The best-ﬁt parameters from 38Ar are applied to the mirror nucleus 38Ca
and the neighboring 36Ar and 40Ar nuclei. For 38Ca this results in an astrophysical reaction rate
of the 38Ca(α,p)41Sc reaction which has a ﬂatter temperature dependence compared to all previous
calculations. For 40Ar a better reproduction of 40Ar(α,p)43K data from literature is obtained.
The disagreement between calculation and an early experimental data point for the 36Ar(α,p)39K
reaction persists.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The cross sections and stellar reaction rates of α-
induced reactions play an important role in various as-
trophysical scenarios. For targets slightly below the
doubly-magic 40Ca, the 38Ar(α,p)41K and 38Ar(α,n)41Ca
reactions have been studied recently because their re-
verse 41K(p,α)38Ar and 41Ca(n,α)38Ar reactions have
been identiﬁed to aﬀect the abundance of the relatively
short-lived 41Ca nucleus in the early solar system. The
dedicated experiment has provided several (α,p) and
(α,n) cross sections at low energies (see [1] and refer-
ences therein). Furthermore, (α,p) reactions on isospin
Tz = −1 nuclei like 30S [2, 3], 34Ar [4, 5], and 38Ca play
a key role in the so-called αp-process in X-ray bursters
[6–8]. Obviously, direct experiments on these short-lived
Tz = −1 nuclei are very diﬃcult, and often indirect infor-
mation from (p,t) reactions is used to estimate the stellar
reaction rates [3, 4, 9].

In general, a very reasonable description of α-induced
reaction cross sections at low energies has been found for
nuclei in the A ≈ 20 − 50 mass range [10]. It is based
on the statistical model (StM) in combination with the
widely used simple 4-parameter α-nucleus optical model
potential (A-OMP) by McFadden and Satchler [11]. In-
terestingly, further ingredients of the StM play a very mi-
nor role in this mass range because the A-OMP deﬁnes
the total α-induced reaction cross section σreac which
is typically dominated by either the (α,n) or the (α,p)
channel. However, the simple approach of a dominating

∗ Electronic Address: mohr@atomki.mta.hu

(α,n) or (α,p) channel does not hold in vicinity of the
doubly-magic 40Ca. The Q-values of the 38Ar(α,n)41Ca
and 38Ar(α,p)41K reactions are both signiﬁcantly nega-
tive, and thus the description of these reactions in the
StM requires additional care.

It is the scope of the present paper to present the rele-
vant details and improvements of the StM calculations in
[1] for the 38Ar(α,n)41Ca and 38Ar(α,p)41K reactions. In
addition, these improvements will be used to predict α-
induced cross sections for the mirror nucleus 38Ca and for
36Ar and 40Ar. For the latter two argon isotopes signiﬁ-
cant discrepancies between the StM calculations and very
old experimental data [12] were identiﬁed in [10]. Note
that new experimental data for the two further outliers in
[10], 23Na [13–15] and 33S [16] (see also [17]), supersede
previous data [18, 19] and are now in better agreement
with the earlier predictions in [10].

II. α-INDUCED CROSS SECTIONS IN THE
STATISTICAL MODEL FOR TARGETS CLOSE
TO 40CA

A. General remarks

The cross sections of α-induced reactions in the present
study have been calculated within the StM. By deﬁni-
tion, the StM provides average cross sections which are
based on the assumption of a suﬃciently high level den-
sity in the compound nucleus.
In the following, the
compound nucleus 42Ca and the system 38Ar+α with
the 38Ar(α,n)41Ca and 38Ar(α,p)41K reactions have been
chosen as an example.

In reality, the (α,n) and (α,p) cross sections for targets

 
 
 
 
 
 
close to 40Ca are composed of the contributions of several
resonances which may be broad and overlapping. A typ-
ical experiment averages these resonance contributions
over an energy interval ∆E which is essentially deﬁned
by the energy distribution of the beam and the energy
loss of projectiles in the target:

∆E = Eexp

max − Eexp

min

(1)

max and Eexp

with Eexp
min being the highest and lowest ex-
perimental energy (given as Ec.m. in the center-of-mass
system). This experimental energy window ∆E cor-
responds to a window ∆E∗ in excitation energies E∗
in the compound nucleus from E∗
min to
E∗
max with the Q-value Qα of the (α,γ)
reaction.

min = Qα + Eexp

max = Qα + Eexp

Depending on the experimental conditions, ∆E may
be of the order of a few keV (for primary beams and
thin targets) or much larger (typically a few hundred
keV for secondary and/or radioactive ion beams with low
intensities and the required thick targets). Obviously, for
a successful application of the StM a suﬃcient number
of resonances has to be located within the experimental
energy interval ∆E. Otherwise, the StM is only able to
provide the average trend of the experimental data.

Besides theoretical estimates from level density formu-
lae, there is a simple experimental criterion for the appli-
cability of the StM. As long as the excitation functions
of the (α,n) and (α,p) reactions show a relatively smooth
energy dependence, the application of the StM should
be justiﬁed. Contrary, the StM must fail to reproduce
experimental excitation functions where the data points
show signiﬁcant scatter from the contributions of individ-
ual resonances. The new experimental data for the cho-
sen examples 38Ar(α,n)41Ca and 38Ar(α,p)41K [1] show
a relatively smooth energy dependence (except the two
lowest data points of the (α,p) reaction), and thus the
StM should be applicable in the present case although
the level densities in the semi-magic 38Ar (N = 20) tar-
get nucleus and 42Ca (Z = 20) compound nucleus remain
relatively small.

B. Formalism of the statistical model

The Hauser-Feshbach StM [20] is described in many
publications. A detailed description for its application to
low-energy reactions and the calculation of astrophysical
reaction rates is provided e.g. in [21]. Here we brieﬂy
repeat the essential deﬁnitions which are relevant in the
following discussion.

In a schematic notation the reaction cross section in

the Hauser-Feshbach (HF) StM [20] is proportional to

by the sum over all contributing channels: Ttot =
The Ti are calculated from optical potentials for the par-
ticle channels and from the gamma-ray strength function
for the photon channel. The Ti include contributions
of all ﬁnal states j in the respective residual nucleus in
the i-th exit channel. In practice, the sum over all ﬁnal
states j is approximated by the sum over low-lying ex-
cited states up to a certain excitation energy ELD (these
levels are typically known from experiment) plus an in-
tegration over a theoretical level density for the contri-
bution of higher-lying excited states:

Tα,0 in Eq. (2) refers to the entrance channel with the tar-
get nucleus (38Ar in the present example) in the ground
state and deﬁnes the total α-induced reaction cross sec-
tion σreac. (For the calculation of astrophysical reaction
rates, thermally excited states in the target have to be
considered in addition.)

There are correlations between the incident and out-
going waves which have to be taken into account by a so-
called width ﬂuctuation correction factor (WFCF) WαX :

σ(α, X) = σ(α, X)HF × WαX

(4)

The WFCFs approach unity at higher energies as soon
as many reaction channels are open. At low energies the
WFCFs lead to an enhancement of the compound-elastic
cross section and to a reduction of the (α,X) reaction
cross sections. Several methods have been suggested to
calculate these WFCFs (see further discussion below).

C.

Ingredients of the statistical model and

sensitivities

From Eqs. (2)–(4) it is obvious that the calculated cross
sections in the StM depend on the transmissions Ti which
in turn depend on the following ingredients. The neu-
tron and proton transmissions Tn and Tp are calculated
from nucleon optical model potentials (N-OMP); the α
transmission Tα depends on the chosen α-nucleus optical
model potential (A-OMP), and the γ transmission Tγ is
given by the γ-ray strength function (GSF). Note that
other channels are typically closed at low energies (or
have only very minor contributions).

All transmissions Tn, Tp, Tα, and Tγ have a further im-
plicit dependence on the chosen level density (LD) which
results from Eq. (3); Tα,0 in Eq. (2) is independent of
the chosen LD. For completeness we point out that the
choice of a LD in Eq. (3) should not be confused with the
required suﬃciently high LD in the energy interval ∆E
in Eq. (1). The former is a choice for a calculation; the
latter is the basic prerequisite for the applicability of the

StM; as such, it is a physical property of the system un-
der investigation and cannot be chosen or even changed
in calculations.

Summarizing, the cross section in the StM depends ex-
plicitly on the chosen A-OMP, N-OMP, and GSF, and im-
plicitly on the chosen LD. As will be shown, the A-OMP
is the most important parameter, whereas the remaining
parameters N-OMP, GSF, and LD have relatively minor
inﬂuence on the (α,n) and (α,p) cross sections. Typically,
the (α,γ) cross section is sensitive to a combination of all
parameters as soon as the energy exceeds the (α,n) or
(α,p) threshold.

In recent work, two diﬀerent approaches have been fol-
lowed to study the sensitivities of the calculated cross
sections in the StM. A strictly mathematical deﬁnition
for the sensitivity is for example provided in [22]. Eq. (1)
of [22] deﬁnes a relative sensitivity of 1.0 if a variation of
the input parameter (typically, a transmission Ti) by a
certain factor (e.g., a factor of two) leads to a variation
of the resulting cross section by the same factor. A more
empirical approach was followed in [1, 23]. Here a reason-
able variation of the input parameters Ti was estimated
from the choice of diﬀerent parametrizations (e.g., a rea-
sonable variation of Tα was estimated from the choice
of diﬀerent A-OMPs), and ﬁnally a χ2-based assessment
was used to select combinations of A-OMPs, N-OMPs,
GSFs, and LDs. These χ2-selected combinations are able
to reproduce the available experimental data within the
measured energy range and should be used for the predic-
tion of cross sections outside the measured energy range
with improved reliability. Although the method of both
approaches is diﬀerent, the conclusions for the reactions
under study in the present work are practically identical.
The last ingredient of the StM calculations is the cho-
sen method for the calculation of the WFCFs in Eq. (4).
Typically, for α-induced reactions the importance of the
WFCFs is very minor. However, this typical behavior
does not apply for the α-induced reactions on 38Ar, and
thus the WFCFs have to be taken into account for 38Ar
and neighboring target nuclei.

As studied in detail in the mass range 20 ≤ A ≤ 50, a
more or less generic behavior of α-induced reaction cross
sections is found [10]. As soon as either the (α,n) or (α,p)
particle channel is open, this channel typically dominates:
Tα,0 ≪ Tn or Tp, and thus the branchings bn or bp ap-
proach unity, see Eq. (2). This is obvious for the neutron
channel because of the missing Coulomb barrier; but it
holds also for the proton channel because the Coulomb
barrier in the proton channel is much lower than in the α
channel. Consequently, either the (α,p) or (α,n) channel
contributes with typically 90% or more to σreac [10]. Un-
der these conditions the WFCFs for the (α,X) channels
become negligible because even a dramatic enhancement
of the weak compound-elastic channel, e.g. say Wαα = 2,
does practically not aﬀect and reduce the dominating
(α,p) or (α,n) cross sections.

For 38Ar the Q-values for the typically dominating
(α,n) or (α,p) channels are both signiﬁcantly negative

3

(Qn = −5.22 MeV and Qp = −4.02 MeV). As a conse-
quence, the usual approximation Tα,0 ≪ Tn or Tp does
not hold for 38Ar, and after formation of the compound
nucleus 42Ca, it may also decay back to the α channel
(compound-elastic channel). As the WFCFs enhance this
channel and reduce the (α,n) and (α,p) channels, it is im-
portant to study diﬀerent methods for the calculation of
the WFCFs.

The results in the following sections are based on cal-
culations with the widely used code TALYS, version 1.80,
[24] which provides the choice of diﬀerent A-OMPs, N-
OMPs, GSFs, LDs, and methods for the calculation of
WFCFs. In addition, the code has been modiﬁed to im-
plement the recently suggested A-OMP ATOMKI-V1 for
heavy targets (A >
∼ 90) [25]. In Sect. III a detailed study
of the sensitivies is provided for the target nucleus 38Ar.
The results for 38Ar are used to constrain the parame-
ters for the mirror nucleus 38Ca and for the neighboring
isotopes 36Ar and 40Ar in Sect. IV.

III. RESULTS FOR 38AR

A χ2 search has been performed to ﬁnd the best com-
bination of input parameters for the new 38Ar(α,n)41Ca
and 38Ar(α,p)41K data [1]. As already summarized in [1],
the best-ﬁt parameters consist of the A-OMP by McFad-
den and Satchler [11] and the TALYS-default N-OMP
by Koning and Delaroche [26]. The χ2 search is not
very sensitive to the chosen LD, but the smallest χ2 is
found for the LD calculated from the generalized super-
ﬂuid model [27, 28]. Finally, the (α,n) and (α,p) cross
sections are practically insensitive to the choice of the
GSF, leading to a χ2 per experimental data point be-
tween 4.76 and 4.78 and an average deviation of 13.6%
to 13.7% for the best-ﬁt A-OMP, N-OMP, and LD, and
an arbitrary choice of the GSF. This minor sensitivity to
Tγ and the GSF is obvious from Eq. (2) where Tγ ap-
i Ti in
pears only as a minor contribution to the sum
the denominator. Consequently, the following discussion
provides detailed information on the sensitivities of the
WFCFs (Sect. III A), the A-OMPs (Sect. III B), the N-
OMPs (Sect. III C), and the LDs (Sect. III D), whereas
a discussion of GSFs is omitted. The best-ﬁt parame-
ters (as stated above) will be used as a reference in the
following presentation.

Fig. 1 illustrates the peculiar behavior of 38Ar and the
importance of the WFCF. The upper part (a) of Fig. 1
shows the total cross section σreac from the reference cal-
culation and the compound-elastic σcompound(α,α). Be-
low the (α,n) and (α,p) thresholds, σreac is dominated
by the compound-elastic contribution. And even up to
almost 10 MeV, there is a signiﬁcant compound-elastic
contribution (blue dashed line) which is enhanced by the
WFCF (in comparison to the calculation without WFCF,
red dotted line). Note that the data for 38Ar are shown
as a function of Eα,lab whereas the experiment [1] was
performed in inverse kinematics.

(middle, b) and (α,p) (lower, c) cross sections are reduced by
the WFCF. Further discussion see text.

The 38Ar(α,n)41Ca and 38Ar(α,p)41K cross sections
are shown in the middle (b) and lower (c) parts of
Fig. 1. Obviously, the reference calculation (including
the WFCF) reproduces the new experimental data [1]
very well, whereas a calculation without WFCF overes-
timates the (α,n) and (α,p) cross sections. Of course,
the WFCF becomes most relevant for the energy range
where the compound-elastic cross section has a signiﬁ-
cant contribution to the total reaction cross section σreac
(i.e., below about 10 MeV). At the highest energies un-
der study around 15 MeV, there is still a signiﬁcant en-
hancement of σcompound(α,α) by about a factor of two
from the WFCF; however, here σcompound(α,α) has only
a very minor contribution of less than 1% to the total
reaction cross section σreac, and thus even a signiﬁcant
enhancement of σcompound(α,α) does practically not af-
fect the dominating (α,n) and (α,p) channels.

Next, the sensitivities to the diﬀerent ingredients of the
StM will be studied in detail for the 38Ar(α,n)41Ca and
38Ar(α,p)41K reactions. For better visibility, all plots
will be normalized to the reference calculation with the
smallest χ2 (as deﬁned above), and the same logarithmic
scale is chosen for all plots of the ratio rcalc = σmod/σref
between the cross section with a modiﬁed parameter

4

σmod and the reference cross section σref .
In addition,
also the new experimental data [1] are shown as ratio
rexp = σexp/σref . All Figs. 2 − 5 with the calculated sen-
sitivities use the same scale with ratios r between 0.3 and
3.0; only in Fig. 3 the vertical size has been increased for
better visibility because of the larger number of lines.

A. Width ﬂuctuation correction factors

The WFCFs can be calculated in TALYS from three
diﬀerent models. Widely used are the approaches by
Moldauer [29] and the iterative method by Hofmann et al.
[30]. A more fundamental approach is based on the Gaus-
sian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) of Hamiltonian matri-
ces [31]; however, in practice this approach requires the
calculation of triple integrals which leads to long com-
putation times in particular at higher energies.
It has
been shown for neutron-induced reactions that the sim-
pler Moldauer approach leads to almost identical results
as the elaborate GOE approach [32, 33]. This has been
veriﬁed for the α-induced reactions on 38Ar in this study
in coarse 1 MeV steps from 3 to 15 MeV. The diﬀerence
between the Moldauer approach and the Hofmann ap-
proach remains small (see Fig. 2). Therefore, the TALYS
default option by Moldauer was used for the reference
calculation.

and 38Ar(α,p)41K reactions for diﬀerent choices for the width
ﬂuctuation correction. All cross sections are normalized to
the reference calculation (see text) which uses the Moldauer
approach for the WFCFs. The deviation of the Hofmann
approach (red dashed) is practically negligible, and also the
GOE approach (blue points) does not show a major deviation
from the reference calculation. However, the cross sections
without width ﬂuctuation correction are signiﬁcantly higher
below 10 MeV (green dash-dotted), in particular for the (α,n)
channel.

For completeness it has to be mentioned that the
TALYS default setting for the WFCFs is only active at

low energies. Above the separation energy of the pro-
jectile from the target, the WFCFs are assumed unity.
Thus, for α-induced reactions on 38Ar with Sα(38Ar) =
7.21 MeV, the width ﬂuctuation correction is turned oﬀ
by default at Eα,lab = 7.21 MeV. It is obvious from Fig. 1
that this is not appropriate for the particular case of 38Ar
although this TALYS default setting is good for most
other α-induced reactions. As a consequence, a TALYS
calculation for 38Ar + α with the default settings for the
width ﬂuctuation correction shows an unphysical kink at
Eα,lab = 7.21 MeV (Ec.m. = 6.5 MeV), see Fig. 5 of [1].

B. α-nucleus optical model potential

The A-OMP is the essential ingredient for the calcu-
lation of α-induced reaction cross sections.
It deﬁnes
the transmission Tα,0 in the entrance channel in Eq. (2)
which corresponds to the total reaction cross section
σreac. There are 8 built-in options for the A-OMP in
TALYS, and the recent ATOMKI-V1 potential has been
implemented in addition. The results from the diﬀerent
AOMPs are shown in Fig. 3.

(Color online) Same as Fig. 2 for the sensitivity of

A-OMP. Except the early potentials by Nolte et al. [35] and
Avrigenau et al. [36], the reproduction of the experimental
data is quite good. But clearly the best description is obtained
from the McFadden/Satchler potential [11].

As explained in [34], the calculated cross sections from
diﬀerent A-OMPs are very close to each other at higher
energies. Diﬀerences become visible at lower energies be-

5

low 10 MeV. The potentials by Nolte et al. [35] and the
earlier version of Avrigeanu et al. [36] clearly overesti-
mate in particular the (α,n) channel. As these potentials
have been adjusted at higher energies, such a discrepancy
at low energies is not surprising. Consequently, these po-
tentials should not be used for the calculation of astro-
physically relevant cross sections and reaction rates.

The potentials by Watanabe [37] (early TALYS de-
fault), Demetriou et al. [38] in three diﬀerent versions,
Avrigeanu et al. [39] in its recent version (new TALYS
default), and ATOMKI-V1 [25] lead to (α,n) and (α,p)
cross sections which remain relatively close to the refer-
ence calculation which is based on the simple 4-parameter
potential by McFadden and Satchler [11]. However, con-
trary to the McFadden/Satchler potential, the other po-
tentials show a trend to overestimate the (α,n) and (α,p)
cross sections by about 10% to 30%, leading to a signiﬁ-
cantly worse χ2 for the comparison with the new experi-
mental data [1].

The present data conﬁrm the general ﬁnding of [10]
that the simple McFadden/Satchler potential does an
excellent job at low energies in the A ≈ 20 − 50 mass
range. Furthermore, the variation of the calculated (α,n)
and (α,p) cross sections from diﬀerent A-OMPs is not as
dramatic as for heavy target nuclei with masses above
A ≈ 100 where discrepancies exceeding one order of mag-
nitude have been seen (e.g. [40]).

The calculation of astrophysical reaction rates for
the 38Ar(α,n)41Ca and 38Ar(α,p)41K reactions is fur-
ther hampered by the negative Q-value of both reactions,
leading to numerical complications. This was already dis-
cussed in detail in [1], and it was concluded that the as-
trophysical reaction rate of both reactions has uncertain-
ties which do not exceed a factor of two for all relevant
temperatures.
In the most relevant temperature range
around T9 ≈ 1 (where T9 is the temperature in Giga-
Kelvin) the uncertainty of the reaction rates is about
30%.

C. Nucleon-nucleus optical model potential

The N-OMP essentially deﬁnes the branching ratio be-
tween the (α,n) and the (α,p) channel. However, the vari-
ation of the (α,n) and (α,p) cross sections remains rela-
tively small because the major inﬂuence on the branching
between (α,n) and (α,p) results from the available phase
space. The results for the diﬀerent N-OMPs under study
are shown in Fig. 4.

The best description of the new experimental data is
achieved by the TALYS default N-OMP by Koning and
Delaroche [26]. Further N-OMPs in TALYS are based
on the work of Jeukenne, Leujenne, and Mahaux (JLM)
[41] in the version of Bauge et al. [42]. In addition to the
original Bauge et al. potential, three modiﬁcations of the
imaginary part of the JLM-type potential can be selected
as suggested by Goriely and Delaroche [43].

In general, compared to the default Koning/Delaroche

potential,
the JLM-type potentials overestimate the
(α,p) channel and underestimate the (α,n) channel. An
exception is the third modiﬁcation of the JLM-type po-
tentials where the imaginary strength is increased by a
factor of two (so-called “jlmmode 3”). This increased
imaginary potential favors the nucleon channels and re-
duces the compound-elastic contribution, leading to an
overestimation of the (α,p) channel and a good descrip-
tion of the (α,n) channel.

D. Level density

As expected from the discussion around Eq. (3), the
inﬂuence of the chosen LD on the calculated (α,n) and
(α,p) cross sections is almost negligible at low energies.
At these low energies all relevant levels in the residual
nuclei are taken into account explicitly in the calcula-
tions. However, at higher energies the importance of the
LD becomes visible (see Fig. 5).

The microscopic level density, calculated from a Gogny
force [44], predicts much lower (α,n) cross sections above
10 MeV and higher (α,p) cross sections. The other avail-
able options behave close to the best-ﬁt LD which is
based on the generalized superﬂuid model [27, 28] (la-
beled “GSM”) with a trend of slightly increased (α,n)
and slightly decreased (α,p) cross sections. The other
options are labeled by “CT+BSFG” for the constant-
temperature model which is matched to the back-shifted
Fermi gas model [45], “BSFG” for the back-shifted Fermi
gas model [45, 46], “mHF-S” for microscopic Hartree-
Fock using Skyrme forces [47], “mHFB-S” for microscopic
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov using Skyrme forces [48], and
“mHFB-G” for microscopic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov us-
ing Gogny forces [44].

FIG. 5.

the 38Ar(α,n)41Ca and 38Ar(α,p)41K reactions on the chosen
LD. The best-ﬁt is obtained from the generalized superﬂuid
model. At higher energies above 10 MeV, the mHFB-G LD
which is based on Gogny forces, shows a much larger (α,p)
cross section and lower (α,n) cross section than all other LDs.
As expected, at low energies the role of the LD is very minor
(see text).

E. Discussion

The calculation with the reference parameters is
able to reproduce the new experimental data for the
38Ar(α,n)41Ca and 38Ar(α,p)41K reactions with a χ2 ≈
4.8 (per point) and an average deviation of about 14%.
Obviously, it is not possible to reproduce the two (α,p)
cross sections at the lowest energies which show signiﬁ-
cant enhancement over the otherwise smooth energy de-
pendence. This enhancement most likely results from
a resonant contribution which should be located around
E∗ ≈ 13.5 MeV in 42Ca with small J π because of the en-
hanced decay to the (α,p) channel, i.e. towards 41K (with
low-J states at low excitation energies) and suppressed
g.s. = 7/2−.
(α,n) contribution, i.e. towards 41Ca with J π
The adjustment of the reference parameters via a strict
χ2 assessment clearly favors the A-OMP by McFadden
and Satchler [11] in combination with the default N-OMP
by Koning and Delaroche [26]. All other combinations of
A-OMPs and N-OMPs lead to an increased χ2 per point
by at least 1.1 from its minimum value of about 4.8 to
5.9 and above. Contrary to this, the LD and the GSF are
not well constrained by the new experimental data. For a
well-deﬁned choice of the LD, the available experimental
data should be extended towards higher energies. The
GSF could be best constrained by a measurement of the
38Ar(α,γ)42Ca cross section over a wide energy range.

In a next step, the reference parameters can be used to
calculate α-induced cross sections for the mirror target
nucleus 38Ca and the neighboring argon isotopes 36Ar
and 40Ar. As the essential parameters of the StM have

been adjusted to experimental data for 38Ar, these cal-
culations should be more reliable than earlier estimates
from global parameter sets. Furthermore, the relevance
of the width ﬂuctuation correction will also be investi-
gated for 38Ca, 36Ar, and 40Ar.

IV. RESULTS FOR 38CA, 36AR, AND 40AR

A.

38Ca

The Q-values of the 38Ca(α,n)41Ti and 38Ca(α,p)41Sc
reactions are Qn = −12.01 MeV and Qp = +1.72 MeV.
Thus, proton emission from the 42Ti compound nucleus
dominates at low energies, and the compound-elastic
channel is much weaker. Consequently, the width ﬂuctu-
ation correction is not relevant for these reactions. How-
ever, the residual nucleus 41Sc of the 38Ca(α,p)41Sc re-
action has only a very small proton separation energy of
Sp = 1.09 MeV, and thus also the (α,2p) channel is open
at all energies. According to TALYS, the (α,p) channel
dominates below about 6 MeV whereas at higher energies
the (α,2p) channel exceeds the (α,p) contribution. The
(α,n) cross section remains below 1 mb up to 15 MeV.
The results are shown in Fig. 6.

choice of diﬀerent LDs is indicated by the blue shaded area.
The dotted magenta line indicates the production cross sec-
tion of 41Sc, i.e. without contributions from higher-lying lev-
els in the residual 41Sc which decay preferentially by proton
emission. The full orange line for the (α,p) cross section is
calculated from the back-shifted Fermi gas LD and will be
discussed later in Sect. IV C.

The calculation of the cross sections for 38Ca uses the
reference parameters which were ﬁxed for 38Ar (as ex-
plained above). Thus, the uncertainty of the predicted

7

cross sections should be relatively low. As the LD was not
well-constrained by the 38Ar data, various parametriza-
tions of the LD were used to estimate the resulting uncer-
tainty for the 38Ca(α,p)41Sc cross section (blue-shaded
area in Fig. 6).

As already mentioned above, the role of the width ﬂuc-
tuation correction remains minor. Similar to 38Ar, the
WFCF enhances the compound-elastic contribution by
about a factor of two. However, because the compound-
elastic channel is at least two orders of magnitude be-
low the total cross section σreac for 38Ca, the WFCF has
practically no inﬂuence on the dominating (α,p) (at low
energies) and (α,2p) channels (at higher energies above
6 MeV).

Because of the astrophysical relevance of (α,p) cross
sections of Tz = −1 nuclei, the reference parameters
are also used to calculate the astrophysical reaction rate
NAhσvi for the 38Ca(α,p)41Sc reaction. The results are
listed in Table I.

for the calculation of NAhσvi.

The calculation of the astrophysical reaction rate
NAhσvi requires an additional consideration of the de-
cay properties of all ﬁnal states in the residual nucleus
41Sc. The 41Sc production cross section from the (α,p)
reaction (as provided by TALYS) is composed essentially
of the contributions of several low-lying states in 41Sc
which are taken into account explicitly, see Eq. (3). Ac-
cording to the ENSDF database [49, 50], only one excited
state with J π = 7/2+ at E∗ = 2882 keV has a notice-
able branching to the J π = 7/2− ground state of 41Sc
whereas the other excited states in 41Sc decay preferen-
tially by proton emission. Therefore the 41Sc production
cross section in TALYS has to be corrected accordingly;
this leads to a slight reduction of the cross section in
the astrophysically relevant energy region by less than a
factor of two and a strong reduction at higher energies.
The 41Sc production cross section is shown in Fig. 6 as
magenta dotted line.

The new recommended rate of the 41Sc production

from the 38Ca(α,p)41Sc reaction is compared to previ-
ous calculations in Fig. 7. Signiﬁcant discrepancies to
all previous evaluations are found which result from the
choice of the A-OMP, from the consideration of the pref-
erential proton decay of excited states in 41Sc, and from
the numerical treatment.

(Color online) Astrophysical reaction rate NAhσvi
FIG. 7.
of the 41Sc production from the 38Ca(α,p)41Sc reaction: com-
parison of the new reference rate from the 38Ar reference pa-
rameters to various previous calculations [24, 51, 52, 54–57].
For better visualization, all rates are normalized to the new
reference rate NAhσviref from this work. Further discussion
see text.

The relevance of the proton decay of excited states in
41Sc is illustrated by the comparison with the rate which
is calculated from the (α,p) cross section as provided by
TALYS (red short-dashed line in Fig. 7, labeled “TALYS-
(α,p)“). At very low temperatures below T9 ≈ 0.3, the
Gamow window is located below 1 MeV. Because of the
only slightly positive Q-value of Qp = +1.72 MeV, ex-
cited states in the residual 41Sc nucleus do not contribute
in the 38Ca(α,p)41Sc reaction below T9 ≈ 0.3, and the
rate is identical to the reference rate. Above T9 = 0.5,
the contributions of excited states increase and lead to
an increased rate by about a factor of 1.7 at T9 = 1
and more than a factor of 3 at T9 = 3. Thus, the refer-
ence rate NAhσviref shows a diﬀerent temperature depen-
dence. Note that these rates were calculated numerically
from the TALYS cross sections in small steps of 5 keV
to avoid numerical complications at low temperatures.
The numerical stability was checked carefully, see also
the discussion in [1].

The role of diﬀerent A-OMPs is illustrated by the
TALYS default rate and by the rate in STARLIB [51, 52].
The TALYS default rate (orange dotted, “TALYS-(α,p)
default” in Fig. 7) is based on the A-OMP by Watanabe
which leads to increased cross sections by about a fac-
tor of two in the astrophysically relevant energy region
around T9 = 1. As the TALYS default calculation does
not take into account the proton decay of excited states
in 41Sc, the inﬂuence of the A-OMP can be seen best by

8

comparison to the “TALYS-(α,p)“ curve in Fig. 7 which
also neglects the proton decay of excited states in 41Sc.
The strong decrease of the TALYS default rate at low
temperatures below T9 ≈ 0.3 results probably from nu-
merics because TALYS automatically selects about 230
energies from 0 to 50 MeV to calculate NAhσvi. (The
TALYS default rate has been calculated within TALYS
whereas the previously discussed rates have been calcu-
lated outside TALYS by numerical integration of TALYS
cross sections in very small steps.)

Contrary to the TALYS default rate, the rate in STAR-
LIB is based on the A-OMP by Demetriou et al. [38] in
its third version [53]. This A-OMP typically shows lower
cross sections than other A-OMPs at low energies. This
trend to lower cross sections becomes also visible for the
38Ar mirror nucleus at the lowest energies in Fig. 3 but
very low energies are not accessible for 38Ar because of
the negative Q-values of the (α,n) and (α,p) reactions.
The lower (α,p) cross sections from the Demetriou et al.
A-OMP lead to lower reaction rates at low temperatures
(blue dotted line in Fig. 7). At higher temperatures the
Demetriou et al. rate exceeds the reference rate because
proton emission from excited states in the 41Sc resid-
ual nucleus was not taken into account. Similar to the
TALYS default rate, also this rate shows was calculated
within TALYS and shows a similar steep drop towards
the lowest temperatures below T9 ≈ 0.3.

The REACLIB [54, 55] rate is taken from the NON-
SMOKER calculations by Rauscher and Thielemann
[56, 57]. NON-SMOKER uses the same A-OMP as the
reference calculation in the present study, but does not
take into account two-particle emission in the exit chan-
nel. This leads to an overestimation of the rate at higher
temperatures because the dominating (α,2p) channel at
higher energies is completely neglected (green dashed line
in Fig. 7). At lower temperatures the REACLIB rate
should approach the reference rate because the same A-
OMP was used. The reason for the deviation by a factor
of about 2 below T9 ≈ 0.5 is not clear; it may be related
to the fact that REACLIB usually provides rates from
their ﬁt function instead of the underlying calculation.

Summarizing, the production rate NAhσvi of 41Sc from
the 38Ca(α,p)41Sc reaction in this work shows a diﬀerent
temperature dependence with lower rates at high temper-
atures because of the dominating proton decay of excited
states in the residual 41Sc nucleus. Around T9 ≈ 1, the
choice of the reference A-OMP by McFadden/Satchler
leads to a rate between the high rate from the TALYS
default potential by Watanabe and the low rate from the
Demetriou potential which was used for STARLIB. Be-
cause of these ﬁndings, further investigations of the (α,p)
cross sections in the αp-process along isospin Tz = −1
nuclei are required to provide all (α,p) reaction rates in
a consistent way and to reduce the uncertainties of the
calculated (α,p) reaction rates.

B.

36Ar

The nucleus 36Ar is one of the two remaining outliers
in the systematics of [10]. Unfortunately, there is only
one experimental data point for the 36Ar(α,p)39K reac-
tion which has been measured more than 60 years ago by
Schwartz et al. [12].

The cross sections for 36Ar have been calculated from
the reference parameters of 38Ar (as deﬁned above) and
are shown in Fig. 8. As for the other nuclei under study,
the width ﬂuctuation correction enhances the compound-
elastic channel by about a factor of two. The compound-
elastic contribution is smaller than in the 38Ar case,
but still signiﬁcant. Consequently, there is a noticeable
reduction of the 36Ar(α,p)39K cross section by about
25% around the energy of the experimental point at
Eα,lab = 7.4 MeV. Although the reduction brings the cal-
culation somewhat closer to the experimental data point,
there still remains a huge discrepancy of at least one or-
der of magnitude. As already pointed out in [10], the
energy of the data point requires a correction by about
−500 keV because Eα,lab = 7.4 MeV in [12] is the nom-
inal beam energy without corrections for the energy loss
in the entrance window of the target and in the target
gas. But even this correction does not lead to reasonable
agreement between the experiment and the present im-
proved calculation. New experimental data are needed
to conﬁrm or to resolve the discrepancy between exper-
iment on the one hand and calculation and systematics
[10] on the other hand.

Similar to the 38Ca case, the uncertainty of the
36Ar(α,p)39K cross section from the choice of the LD
was investigated. It turns out that the level density in
the residual nuclei is quite low, and thus the transmis-
sions Ti in Eq. (3) are essentially deﬁned by the sum over
known low-lying levels in the ﬁrst term on the l.h.s. of
Eq. (3). Consequently, the choice of various LDs for the
36Ar(α,p)39K reaction leads to practically identical cross
sections at low energies (within a line width in Fig. 8
below about 13 MeV). The range of calculations from
diﬀerent LDs is illustrated by the blue-shaded area in
Fig. 8. A similar small sensitivity to the choice of the
LD is found for the 36Ar(α,n)39Ca reaction.

C.

40Ar

The procedure of the previous Sect. IV B was repeated
for 40Ar which is the second remaining outlier in the
systematics of [10]. Again, the choice of the reference
parameters in combination with a proper treatment of
the WFCFs should lead to a reliable prediction of the
40Ar(α,n)43Ca and 40Ar(α,p)43K cross sections. The re-
sults are shown in Fig. 9 and compared to experimental
data [12, 58, 59]. The (α,n) and (α,p) reactions have
both slightly negative Q-values with Qn = −2.28 MeV
and Qp = −3.33 MeV. In the shown energy range be-
tween 5 and 15 MeV, the (α,n) channel dominates and

is very close to the total reaction cross section σreac.
Again, the compound-elastic cross section is enhanced by
about a factor of two, but this enhancement of the weak
compound-elastic channel does practically not aﬀect the
stronger (α,n) and (α,p) channels, and thus the calcu-
lated reaction cross sections with and without WFCFs
are practically identical.

As for 36Ar, the early data by Schwartz et al. [12] are
overestimated by almost one order of magnitude, and a
signiﬁcant overestimation persists also after a correction
of the energy by about −500 keV (as for 36Ar as discussed
in the previous Sect. IV B and in [10]).

Interestingly, the later (α,p) data by Tanaka et al. [58]
(only one data point below 15 MeV) and by Fenyvesi
et al. [59] were also overestimated by the calculation in
[10]. However, the present detailed study shows that the
calculated 40Ar(α,p)43K cross section at higher energies
depends sensitively on the chosen parametrization of the
LD whereas the dominating 40Ar(α,n)43Ca cross section
is only weakly aﬀected. The range of calculated cross sec-
tions from diﬀerent LDs is indicated in Fig. 9 as shaded

The range of calculations from diﬀerent parametrizations of

on the constant temperature plus Fermi gas model (as
used in [10]) leads to an overestimation of the experimen-
tal (α,p) data. Contrary to this, the reference LD from
the generalized superﬂuid model slightly underestimates
the experimental data, and the LD from the back-shifted
Fermi gas (BSFG) model reproduces the experimental
data well. Thus, it seems that at least for the residual
odd-even nuclei with A = 43 the BSFG LD is a better
choice than the reference LD from the generalized super-
ﬂuid model.

Among the cross sections of the other nuclei 36Ar,
38Ar, and 38Ca, only the 38Ca(α,p)41Sc cross section is
slightly sensitive to the chosen LD. Therefore, those cal-
culations were repeated using the BSFG LD instead of
the reference LD from the generalized superﬂuid model.
Below 10 MeV the calculated result from the BSFG LD is
practically identical to the calculation with the reference
LD, and above 10 MeV the BSFG LD leads to slightly
higher cross sections (see orange line in Fig. 6).

If the ﬁnal calculation of the 40Ar(α,p)43K cross sec-

10

tion is considered as reliable in the entire energy range of
Fig. 9, a correction factor for the early data by Schwartz
et al. [12] can be derived. Assuming a 500 keV shift to
lower energies because of the energy loss in the entrance
window (as suggested in [10]), a correction factor of about
5 is found. The same correction procedure (500 keV en-
ergy shift and increase of the cross section by a factor of
ﬁve) leads also to good agreement between the calcula-
tions and the experiment of Schwartz et al. [12] for the
40Ar(α,n)43Ca and 36Ar(α,p)39K reactions. This ﬁnding
can be considered as evidence that such a correction is
indeed required for the early Schwartz et al. data.

V.

ISOSPIN CONSIDERATIONS

As pointed out in Sec. II C, the successful application
of the StM is based on a suﬃciently high level density in
the compound nucleus, and thus the StM is applicable
for intermediate mass and heavy nuclei. Under these cir-
cumstances the role of isospin conservation is very minor,
and typical computer codes like TALYS do not consider
isospin explicitly for the calculation of the transmission
coeﬃcients in Eq. (3). However, for light nuclei, in par-
ticular for target nuclei with isospin T = 0 (N = Z),
substantial changes may occur for α-induced reactions.
These changes are related to the fact that the α projec-
tile with T = 0 can only populate states in the compound
nucleus with the same isospin T as the target nucleus.
Without explicit consideration of isospin, Eq. (3) over-
estimates the transmissions to the proton and neutron
channels because of additional isospin couplings which
result from T 6= 0 of the ejectiles. Contrary, the α chan-
nel with T = 0 is calculated correctly in Eq. (3). The
resulting suppression of the (α,n) and (α,p) channels has
been discussed in detail by Grimes [60], and Table I of
[60] shows the isospin couplings for α-induced reactions
on targets with isospin T = 0, 1/2, and 1. We follow the
idea of [60], starting with the T = 2 target 40Ar, and
provide an approximate correction for the TALYS cross
sections. Detailed information on the role of isospin in
StM calculations for nuclear astrophysics is also provided
in [61, 62]; in particular, [62] focuses on the important
point of isospin suppression in (α,γ) capture reactions in
self-conjugate N = Z nuclei.

A. Target 40Ar, compound 44Ca: T = 2, Tz = +2

According to [60], the isospin coupling is given by the
square of the respective Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient which
couples the isospins TE of the ejectile and TR of the
residual nucleus to the isospin TC of the compound nu-
cleus. For the 40Ar target we ﬁnd for the α channel
< TR Tz,R TE Tz,E | TC Tz,C >= 1.0; the coupling to the
α channel is 1.0 (this result also holds for all reactions un-
der study). For the proton channel with the residual 43K
(TR = 5/2, Tz,R = +5/2) we obtain a Clebsch-Gordan

p

coeﬃcient of
5/6, leading to a coupling of 5/6. For
the neutron channel with the residual 43Ca (TR = 3/2,
Tz,R = +3/2) the coupling is 1.0; contributions of higher-
lying states in 43Ca with TR = 5/2; Tz,R = +3/2 with
a coupling of 1/6 are neglected. The given couplings ex-
tend Table I of [60] for the case of TC = 2, Tz,C = +2.

An approximate correction to the TALYS calculations
in the previous sections can be made as follows. The
correction is based on the assumptions of isospin conser-
vation (also excluding isospin mixing) and the indepen-
dence of the transmission coeﬃcients on the isospin. It
will be shown that the resulting corrections are minor for
the reactions under study, and thus the above simplifying
assumptions have no major eﬀect on the ﬁnal conclusions
of the present study. Furthermore, as isospin conserva-
tion is violated to some extent, the following correction
may be considered as an upper limit for the relevance of
isospin in the StM.

The isospin-corrected cross sections σiso(α, X) are

given by

σiso(α, X) = N wX σ(α, X)

where the wX are the isospin couplings (as provided
above and in Table I of [60]), and N is a normalization
factor to fulﬁll

σreac ≈ σ(α, n) + σ(α, p) + σ(α, α)

≈ σiso(α, n) + σiso(α, p) + σiso(α, α)

(6)

for the total α-induced reaction cross section σreac at low
energies; other open channels like e.g. (α,γ) are typically
weak and are neglected in Eq. (6). For 40Ar this results
in

N =

1 −

(cid:20)

σ(α, p)
6 σreac (cid:21)

−1

(7)

from wp = 5/6 and wn = wα = 1. Note that N ≥ 1
close to unity, thus leading to an enhancement of the
reaction channels with wX = 1 and to a reduction for
channels with wX < 1. Because the (α,p) contribution
to σreac does not exceed a few per cent in the energy range
under study (see Fig. 9), the normalization factor N in
Eq. (7) remains very close to unity for 40Ar. According to
Eq. (5), the (α,p) cross section is thus reduced by about a
factor of 5/6 which is inside the shown uncertainty from
the choice of the level density, and the other channels are
practically not aﬀected by the isospin correction.

B. Target 38Ar, compound 42Ca: T = 1, Tz = +1

The respective numbers for the couplings are wp = 3/4

and wn = wα = 1, and the normalization is given by

N =

1 −

(cid:20)

−1

σ(α, p)
4 σreac (cid:21)

(8)

11

As the (α,p) contribution remains below 40% for the
whole energy range under study, the normalization fac-
tor does not exceed N ≈ 1.1, leading only to a slight
enhancement of the (α,n) and (α,α) channels and a re-
duction of the (α,p) cross section by about 20%.

In Sec. III C and Fig. 4 it was pointed out that the
branching between the (α,n) and (α,p) channels depends
essentially on the chosen N-OMP, and it was concluded
that only the TALYS default N-OMP by Koning and
Delaroche [26] is able to reproduce the new experimen-
tal data [1]. The JLM-type potentials showed a trend to
overestimate the (α,p) cross sections and underestimate
the (α,n) cross sections. These deviations of the JLM-
type potentials are approximately compensated by the
isospin corrections from Eq. (5), and thus the clear pref-
erence for the TALYS default potential by Koning and
Delaroche [26] is weakened by the isospin correction in
Eq. (5).

C. Target 38Ca, compound 42Ti: T = 1, Tz = −1

Here the results for wX and N can be taken from the
previous Sec. V B; only the role of neutrons and protons
has to be exchanged in the given numbers for N and wX .
Because of the strongly negative Q-value of Qn ≈ −12
MeV, the isospin corrections vanish for almost the full
energy range under study. In particular, the calculated
reaction rates in Table I are not aﬀected by the isospin
correction.

D. Target 36Ar, compound 40Ca: T = 0, Tz = 0

As already pointed out in [60], the largest corrections
are expected for α-induced reactions on N = Z target
nuclei with T = 0. Here we ﬁnd wn = wp = 1/2, wα =
1.0, and

N =

1 −

(cid:20)

σ(α, n) + σ(α, p)
2 σreac

−1

(cid:21)

(9)

which leads to an enhancement of the α channel and to a
reduction of the (α,n) and (α,p) cross sections. However,
the reduction does not reach a factor of two (as one might
expect from the coupling of 1/2 for the neutron and pro-
ton channels) because the total reaction cross section is
dominated by the (α,p) contribution. Note that in the
extreme case of σreac ≈ σ(α,p), the normalization ap-
proaches N ≈ 2, thus compensating the reduction by
the coupling of 1/2 in Eq. (5); in this case the strong
enhancement of the tiny (α,α) contribution by a factor
of two does practically not aﬀect the dominating (α,p)
channel.

The isospin-corrected cross sections for 36Ar are shown
in Fig. 10. It is obvious from Fig. 10 that the reduction
of the 36Ar(α,p)39K cross section from the isospin cor-
rection in Eq. (5) is only about 30% at 7.5 MeV and thus

cannot resolve the huge discrepancy to the experimental
data point by Schwartz et al. [12].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The new experimental data for the 38Ar(α,n)41Ca and
38Ar(α,p)41K reactions [1] were analyzed within the sta-
tistical model using the TALYS code. Best-ﬁt input pa-
rameters for the statistical model calculations were deter-
mined by a χ2-based assessment [1]. The present study
provides a careful discussion of the uncertainties from
the diﬀerent ingredients of the statistical model.
It is
found that a very good description of the experimen-
tal data can only be achieved from the α-nucleus po-
tential by McFadden and Satchler [11] in combination
with the default nucleon potential by Koning and De-
laroche [26]. The smallest χ2 is furthermore achieved for
the level density from the generalized superﬂuid model,
but because of the minor sensitivity to the level density,
other parametrizations of the level density are not ex-

12

cluded by the new data. As the experimental (α,n) and
(α,p) data for 38Ar are not sensitive to the chosen γ-ray
strength, no conclusion can be drawn on the choice of
the γ-ray strength function. In addition, the importance
of a proper treatment of the width ﬂuctuation correc-
tion is pointed out especially for the 38Ar(α,n)41Ca and
38Ar(α,p)41K reactions.
Isospin corrections to the cal-
culated reaction cross sections reduce the 36Ar(α,n)39Ca
and 36Ar(α,p)39K cross sections by about 30%, play a
minor role with about 10 − 20% correction for 38Ar, and
are practically negligible for 38Ca and 40Ar.

The best-ﬁt parameters from the 38Ar data are used as
reference parameters to predict α-induced cross sections
for the isospin mirror nucleus 38Ca and for the neigh-
boring argon isotopes 36Ar and 40Ar with improved re-
liability, and a new astrophysical reaction rate NAhσvi
is calculated for the 38Ca(α,p)41Sc reaction. This new
NAhσvi shows a diﬀerent temperature dependence than
previous calculations because proton decay from excited
states in the residual 41Sc nucleus was not taken into
account in earlier work. However, before ﬁrm conclu-
sions on astrophysical consequences can be drawn, fur-
ther (α,p) reactions on the isospin Tz = −1 nuclei from
22Mg to 34Ar should also be re-investigated.

for

[12]

For 36Ar the disagreement between the early ex-
perimental data by Schwartz et al.
the
36Ar(α,p)39K reaction persists, and this holds also for
the 40Ar(α,n)43Ca and 40Ar(α,p)43K reactions. But it
was found that more recent data for the 40Ar(α,p)43K
reaction [58, 59] can now be reproduced in a calculation
which uses the well-constrained reference parameters for
the α-nucleus potential and the nucleon-nucleus poten-
tial and a diﬀerent level density from the back-shifted
Fermi gas model. 36Ar and 40Ar have been identiﬁed as
the two remaining outliers in the general systematics of
α-induced cross sections in the A ≈ 20 − 50 mass range
[10]. At least for 40Ar, the role as outlier is reduced
by the improved reproduction of 40Ar(α,p)43K data of
[58, 59].
In combination with the good description of
the new data for 38Ar, the α-induced cross sections for
36Ar and 40Ar may also be considered as regular if all
early data by Schwartz et al. [12] for 36Ar and 40Ar are
shifted by about 500 keV to lower energies and increased
by about a factor of ﬁve.
