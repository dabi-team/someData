Abstract

Inelastic neutron scattering instruments require very low background; therefore

the proper shielding for suppressing the scattered neutron background, both

from elastic and inelastic scattering is essential. The detailed understanding

of the background scattering sources is required for eﬀective suppression. The

Multi-Grid thermal neutron detector is an Ar/CO2 gas ﬁlled detector with a
10B4C neutron converter coated on aluminium substrates.

It is a large-area

detector design that will equip inelastic neutron spectrometers at the European

Spallation Source (ESS). To this end a parameterised Geant4 model is built

for the Multi-Grid detector. This is the ﬁrst time thermal neutron scattering

background sources have been modelled in a detailed simulation of detector

response. The model is validated via comparison with measured data of proto-

types installed on the IN6 instrument at ILL and on the CNCS instrument at

SNS. The eﬀect of scattering originating in detector components is smaller than

eﬀects originating elsewhere.

1. Introduction

Inelastic neutron scattering is a very powerful technique for exploring atomic

and molecular motion, as well as magnetic and crystal ﬁeld excitations [1]. Time-

of-Flight (ToF) spectrometers allow a broad phase space to be measured in a

single setting; this is typically achieved with a large area detector array [2]. In

typical state-of-the-art neutron instruments [2–8], this detector array can be 10–

50 m2. One of the main performance criteria of these spectrometers is typically

deﬁned by the Signal-to-Background Ratio (SBR), therefore understanding and

enhancing the latter is important for the instrument optimisation. In particular,

scattered neutrons have a signiﬁcant contribution to the SBR. The estimation

of the SBR is done currently on a series of prescriptions based on observations

of historical instrument installation.

As a consequence of the recent restructuring of the 3He market [9], a need

for cost eﬀective 3He-replacing detector solutions is raised [10], especially for

inelastic neutron scattering instruments, where large area detectors with high

SBR are required. A potent new solution for this type of instruments is the

Multi-Grid detector [11; 12], which will be used for the three Time-of-Flight

chopper spectrometers at ESS [13–16]. The Multi-Grid design was invented

at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) [17; 18], and the detector now is jointly

developed by the ILL and the ESS within the CRISP [19] and BrightnESS [20]

projects.

The Multi-Grid detector is an Ar/CO2-ﬁlled proportional chamber with a
solid boron-carbide (10B4C) neutron converter, enriched in 10B [21–23]. The

basic unit of the Multi-Grid detector is the grid, an aluminium frame; thin alu-

minium lamellas, coated on their both sides with boron-carbide, the so called

blades are placed in this frame, parallel with each other and the entrance window

of the grid, dividing the grid into cells. In the detector the grids are structured

into columns, and this way the cells one above the other form tubes, and the

signals are readout both from the frames and the anode wires that go through

2

the whole length of the column in the centre of the cells. The planned detec-

tor modules and the prototypes are built of these columns. A series of small

size prototypes and large scale demonstrators are already built and tested at

diﬀerent sources and instruments [24; 25], and the development of the detector

has already entered the up-scaling phase. As Multi-Grid is a large area detec-

tor, full scale design is limited by cost considerations. However, detailed Monte

Carlo modelling can help tackle the limitations and provide guidelines for the

up-scaling design, which is particularly important for detectors that have to

provide excellent SBR ∼ O(105).

The two-fold aim of the current study is to introduce a detailed Geant4

model of the Multi-Grid detector including validation against datasets of exper-

iments [24; 25] performed on existing demonstrators, as well as to identify the

various components of the scattered neutron background, induced by cold and

thermal neutrons internally and externally to the Multi-Grid detector.

The Geant4 model of the Multi-Grid detector is presented in Section 2. In

Section 3, the model validation against the measured ToF ﬂight distance and

energy transfer data from the IN6 (Cold neutron time-focusing time-of-ﬂight

spectrometer IN6-Sharp), and in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 the CNCS (Cold Neutron

Chopper Spectrometer) demonstrator tests are shown. As part of the repro-

duction of the CNCS demonstrator measured data, a study of the individual

contributions to the scattered neutron background is also discussed.

In Sec-

tion 4.3 results regarding the neutron scattering on the aluminium components

of the detector vessel of the CNCS detector are described. Finally, in Section 5

the obtained results are concluded from the aspects of validation, and the fur-

ther utilisation of the built model for detailed background analysis and for the

optimisation of the detector vessel design is also shown.

2. Geant4 model of Multi-Grid detector

A general, parameterised Geant4 [26–28] model of the Multi-Grid detector

has been developed within the ESS Detector Group Simulation Framework [29],

3

with the usage of the NXSG4 [30] extension library. The latter enables the

crystalline structure of aluminium, used in the detector frame. For all other

components, standard Geant4 materials are used. The physics list is the stan-

dard QGSP BIC HP, except when polyethylene is included in the materials, in

which case a customised physics list is preferred instead [31], due to the relevance

of thermal scattering on the high hydrogen-content of the polyethylene.

From the ﬂexible, full-scale model, the realistic models of two demonstrators

that were tested at the IN6 [24] at ILL and and at the CNCS [25] at SNS were

also prepared. To reach a very ﬂexible geometry, a few simpliﬁcations were done.

(a)

(b)

Figure 1: Real grid (1a) and grid geometry implemented in Geant4 (1b).

The basic unit of the model is the so called cell, a 2 × 2 × 1 cm3 counting gas

volume of the detector, delimited by B4C-coated aluminium blades. Therefore

everything has to be symmetrical at the cell level, like the blade thicknesses,

the cell volumes and most importantly the coating thicknesses. This estimation

is applied in the basic model and the IN6, but in the CNCS demonstrator a

series of diﬀerent coating thicknesses are used (13 × 0.5 µm + 14 × 1.0 µm + 6 ×

1.5 µm + 1 × 1.0 µm). So for the latter model, the coating thicknesses are hard-

coded to ﬁt the real prototype, and so the grid became the basic unit for this

detector. The anode wires and the electronics of the detector are excluded from

the models, as it is shown in Figure 1. The major parameters of the prepared

4

models are shown in Table 1.

The simulated primary neutrons are generated at the sample position. The

sample is placed at the centre of the geometry, with the z direction chosen as

the beam direction, leading to x as horizontal and to y as vertical coordinates.

The sample-to-detector distance is deﬁned as the shortest distance from the

sample position to the entrance window of the detector: grid window or vessel

window, in case the latter is enabled. Basic particle guns, like a pencil beam,

4π and cylindrical sources are used, as well as targeted beams to irradiate only

the detector surface. Although the physics of the samples themselves is not

implemented in the simulations, the above listed particle guns are deﬁned both

as point and volume sources (1 x 1 x 1 cm3 cube or cylinder with 1 cm diameter).

Some instrument eﬀects are introduced via the source deﬁnition, like the energy

distribution of the incident primary neutrons.

In chopper spectroscopy the data of interest are the momentum- and energy

transfer of the scattered neutrons. These are derived from the primary measured

quantities: the detection coordinates (giving the ﬂight distance) and the ToF.

The ﬂight distance is deﬁned as the distance from the sample position to the

detection coordinates. The simulated detection coordinates are reduced to the

centre of the cell in which the neutron is detected, despite the higher resolution

of the simulation. ToF is simulated from sample position. The detector model

is validated against these raw measured quantities of the IN6 demonstrator, and

a detailed study of scattered neutron background is also performed regarding

the energy transfer in the CNCS demonstrator.

3. Model of demonstrator test on the IN6 instrument at ILL

At the IN6 experiment the demonstrator (Figure 2a) is tested with neutron

beams of 4.1, 4.6 and 5.1 ˚A (i.e. 4.87, 3.87 and 3.15 meV, respectively), irra-

diating the entire entrance surface. The same geometry is implemented in the

simulation (Figure 2b) and validated against the measured and published ToF

spectra. Due to the lack of data on the measurement setup (e.g., exact chop-

per settings and timing references), the measured and simulated ToF spectra

are compared either in a relative time scale, or all of them are scaled to the

time scale of the simulation, in which the neutrons and their respective ToF are

generated at the sample position.

(b)

Figure 2: As built IN6 prototype (2a) and its Geant4 model (2b).

The detector geometry is irradiated with pencil and targeted beams, in or-

der to illuminate the entrance surface (see Figure 3), both with sharply mono-

energetic and Gauss-smeared initial neutron energy distributions of 4.1, 4.6 and

5.1 ˚A. For preparing the demonstrative study on the 2-dimensional distributions

of the ToF spectra as the function of the depth of detection, a minor simpli-

ﬁcation was performed: for this demonstration only 1 column of the detector

model was used, since in this case z-coordinate one-to-one corresponds to the

detection depth in detector, leading to an easy readout.

3.1. Simulation results for IN6 Demonstrator detector

For the IN6 experiment, ToF spectra and 2D detection depth dependent ToF

spectra are simulated and compared to the published measurements at 4.1, 4.6

and 5.1 ˚A wavelengths. In Figure 4 the comparison of the measured (Figures 4a

– 4c) and the simulated ToF-spectra as a function of the depth of detection

is presented with mono-energetic (Figures 4d – 4f) and Gaussian (Figures 4g

– 4i) incident neutron energy distributions. At all wavelengths the main path

7

Figure 3: Geometry view of the IN6 Geant4 detector model irradiated with targeted beam.

of the incident detected neutrons clearly appears as a skew line both in the

measured and the simulated distributions. The angle of the path is related to

the neutron’s velocity.

Beside the main path, at 4.1 and 4.6 ˚A wavelengths that are below the alu-

minium Bragg edge [32; 33], the traces of the detected scattered neutrons appear

as well. On the one hand, in the near surface region a triangle-shaped shadow

appears beside the main neutron path, produced by the neutrons detected af-

ter scattering on the intermediate aluminium blades. On the other hand, a

short, opposite direction skew line appears for these two wavelengths, both in

the measured and simulated distributions, starting from the unshielded rear end

of the detector, caused by a signiﬁcant fraction of scattered neutrons coming

from the detector end blade. Both eﬀects are caused by the Bragg-scattering

on aluminium and emphasise the need for targeted shielding in the detector.

With the reproduction of these ToF characteristics and scattering phenom-

ena, the developed Geant4 model is qualitatively validated. For a quantitative

validation, 1D ToF histograms are also simulated.

The simulated ToF spectra are quantitatively compared with the measured

8

ones for all three wavelengths. The simulations are produced with the same

Gaussian initial energy distributions that were previously applied for the 2D

ToF-depth studies. The standard deviations of the distributions are estimated

to ﬁt both the typical instrument energy resolution and the measured ToF

data.

In Figure 5 the measured and simulated ToF spectra are presented in

a relative time scale. The IN6 Multi-Grid demonstrator has a considerable

α-background [34], coming from the uranium and thorium content of the non-

puriﬁed aluminium of the grids. This background is random and evenly dis-

tributed in time. Therefore, updated simulated spectra are reproduced for all

wavelengths, where a subsequent background correction is applied. This is per-

formed with a continuous, ﬂat time-constant background added to the simulated

ToF spectra, in order to obtain a better comparison with the measured results.

The background is estimated to ﬁt the average measured background. In the

case of 5.1 ˚A, the background is not entirely ﬂat, which is presumably caused by

additional eﬀects of the measurement setup and the instrument. As an example,

adding the resolution [35] of the Fermi-chopper in the model would give a better

description of the tails of the Gaussian ToF peaks. Due to lack of additional

information it is impossible to estimate these eﬀects.

Figure 5 demonstrates that the measured and simulated ToF peaks agree at

all the studied wavelengths. Moreover, by applying a correction of a continuous

background, the right-hand-side decrease of the ToF spectrum is also reproduced

quantitatively, with only a small discrepancy in the values at 4.1 and 4.6 ˚A.

These analysis results of the IN6 model and data serve as quantitative vali-

dation of the Multi-Grid simulation.

The now validated model is applicable to general Multi-Grid irradiation

setups, like the CNCS demonstrator test, for identifying detector and instrument

background eﬀects.

4. Model of demonstrator test on CNCS instrument at SNS

A two-column Multi-Grid prototype is tested [25] at the CNCS instrument.

The detector columns consist of 2 x 48 grids, with 1 mm Gd2O3 shielding on

the rear end of the grids, and a 2 mm thick MirroBor [36] rubber layer with

80 mass % natural B4C content is also inserted between the columns to reduce

cross-scattering.

The columns are placed in an aluminium vessel, as shown in Figure 6 and Fig-

ure 7, and the whole detector volume is ﬁlled with counting gas: Ar/CO2 (80/20

by volume) at nominal room temperature and pressure. The Geant4 model of

the detector was built with the same parameters.

In this model some of the instrument components are also present. The

measurement chamber is ﬁlled with tank gas: Ar/CO2 (98/2 by volume) at

nominal room temperature and pressure. Tank gas is the gas in the cylindrical

chamber on the ﬂight path between the sample and the detector.

A simpliﬁed model of the sample environment is also implemented. It con-

sists of a double-wall aluminium cylinder with radii of 10 and 12 cm and a 2 mm

wall-thickness, representing the cryostat, and a 0.5 mm thick aluminium win-

dow with 74 cm radius (see Figure 8), representing the barrier between air and

tank gas. In addition a 2◦ collimator is involved, placed between the cryostat

and the aluminium window. The collimator is built of 136 pieces of 1 m high

and 10 cm long stainless steel blades with 2 × 10 µm Gd2O3 painting.

A signiﬁcant eﬀort has been made to understand and reduce the background

in the Multi-Grid and other solid boron converter based detectors. As a part

of this, the α-, γ- and fast neutron background components have been studied

and reduced, as described in [34], [37] and [38], respectively. These background

components are also omitted from the simulation, as the remnant background is

negligible in comparison with the implemented instrument-related background

sources [25].

A series of tests are performed and published with this measurement setup,

and the high statistics results with a vanadium sample [25] at 1.0, 3.678 and

10

3.807 meV (i.e. 9.04, 4.72 and 4.64 ˚A, respectively) are selected for simulating.

In order to identify the scattered background components, the simulations are

repeated with multiple geometry conﬁgurations, e.g. with and without sample

environment or detector vessel, as well as with multiple neutron generators, e.g.

a targeted beam irradiating the entire detector surface or a 4π-source, all with

mono-energetic and Gaussian initial neutron energy distributions. The σ of the

Gaussian distribution is chosen as 0.006 meV for the 1.0 and 0.030 meV for the

3.678 and 3.807 meV incident neutron energies, respectively, to ﬁt the measured

data, considering the known 1 % resolution of the CNCS instrument.

The complete model of detector & sample environment was checked with

the simulation of the directly measured ToF and ﬂight distance data.

4.1. Simulation results of primary measured data for CNCS demonstrator de-

tector

The directly measured quantities, the ToF and the ﬂight distance are sim-

ulated for checking the implemented detector and instrument setup of all the

afore mentioned components.

The measured and simulated ToF and ﬂight distance spectra at 3.678 and

3.807 meV incident neutron energies, below and above the aluminium Bragg-

edge, are compared in Figures 9 and 10.

As shown in Figures 9a and 9b, a series of peaks appear in both measured

and simulated ﬂight distance spectra, relating to the geometrical cell structure

of the grids. The resolution of the detector is aﬀected by this cell structure,

therefore these peaks are related to the rows of cells in the detector. The peaks

are visible in the ﬁrst 10–15 cm of the detector, where the majority of the

neutrons are detected, therefore the statistics are the highest. The falling tail

of the spectra is determined by the neutrons detected in the rear cells of the

15

detector, and by the scattered neutrons, having a longer ﬂight distance. There

is a diﬀerence in the cutoﬀ of the two spectra, since the last row is not read out

in the measurement, contrary to the simulation.

Both the overlaying peaks and the characteristics of the falling tails of the

measured and simulated spectra are in good agreement at both energies below

and above the aluminium Bragg-edge.

The measured and simulated ToF spectra are compared in Figure 10. The

simulated ToF is measured from the sample position, while the experimental

data are given relatively to the 16667 µs period of the SNS pulse.

An arbitrary shift is applied on the measured spectra to overlay them with

the simulated ones. This way the measured and simulated ToF peaks are ﬁt at

both energies; the shape and the width of the peaks give good agreement.

In both spectra the measured and simulated backgrounds also reasonably

agree with the presence of some discrepancies between them. The source of

these discrepancies is that not all instrument related eﬀects are included in the

simulation. For example instrument background radiation, initial ToF distribu-

tion of neutrons, and some of the sample environment components are omitted,

since the aim of the current study focuses on understanding detector eﬀects.

However, the level of agreement of the measured and simulated backgrounds

are acceptable, considering the diversity of backgrounds of the existing chopper

spectrometers.

In essence, the measured and simulated ToF of elastic peaks agree well.

Therefore, the now tested CNCS irradiation setup can be used for performing

detailed scattered neutron background study.

4.2. Energy transfer and background diﬀerentiation from measurement and sim-

ulation

Measured and simulated energy transfer spectra are compared as part of

the validation process of the implemented Multi-Grid detector model. Simu-

lations are also performed with diﬀerent geometries, with the additional aim

of identifying and distinguishing the sources of neutron scattering. The energy

transfer is deﬁned as Etrf = Einitial − Ef inal, therefore the elastic peak appears

centred around 0 meV, while the negative side represents the neutrons detected

with energy gain and the positive side represents the neutrons with energy loss

in comparison with the initial energy. For this study the detector background

is deﬁned as all neutron events in the energy transfer spectrum outside of the

elastic peak. Since the peaks are sharp and well-identiﬁable, the peak borders

18

are estimated visually. The background is always given normalised to the peak:

background f raction =

T otal counts − Counts in peak

.

The simulations are performed in the 1.0–8.0 meV incident neutron energy

range. The measured and simulated energy transfer spectra at 1.0, 3.678 and

3.897 meV incident neutron energy, below and above the aluminium Bragg edge

are presented in Figures 11a, 12a and 13a respectively. Simulations are repeated

adding one-by-one the geometrical and instrumental components (see Section 4)

to the simulation. The spectra are compared in Figures 11b, 12b and 13b, while

the obtained scattered neutron background data are given in Table 2. “Bare

detector grids” means two columns of grids, without the aluminium vessel.

In the energy transfer spectrum of the bare grids the elastic peak is mono-

energetic at 0 meV and an asymmetric scattered neutron background also ap-

pears. The source of the background on the negative side is the neutrons that

gained energy via inelastic scattering. The major source of higher and broader

background on the positive side is the contribution of the elastically scattered

neutrons. Since the ﬂight distance is calculated from the detection coordinates,

assuming the shortest path between the detection point and the sample, but

the ToF measured represents the entire neutron path, in the case of elastic

scattering a longer ToF is combined with a shorter ﬂight distance, resulting to

the registration of an eﬀectively slower neutron. These neutrons have an ap-

parent energy loss, and cause the asymmetrical, high intensity background. In

Figure 13b a ﬁne structure of peaks also appears near the elastic peak on the

positive side: this peak relates to the grid structure, the coherent scattering

between the aluminium blades. Therefore this eﬀect appears only above the

aluminium Bragg-edge.

A similar spectrum is obtained with the complete detector model inside the

vessel. The scattered neutron background increases on both sides with respect

to the one of the bare grids.

The eﬀect of a Gaussian initial neutron energy distribution appears in Fig-

19

ures 11b, 12b and 13b; the initial energy distribution deﬁnes the shape of the

elastic peak, while its impact on the background is negligible. The realistic

Gaussian distribution only aﬀects the background by the increased peak width.

It is also apparent that the coherent scattering eﬀects of the blades are hidden

in the case of realistic incident neutron energy distributions.

Including the tank gas and components of the sample environment, a con-

tinuous, ﬂat scattered neutron background appears in the spectra. In all cases,

the asymmetric detector background has a comparable shape, appearing as a

shoulder on the side of the elastic peak. While at 1.0 meV (Figure 11b) and

3.678 meV (Figure 12b) the background is coming from the tank gas and the

sample environment are comparable, at 3.807 meV (Figure 13b) the aluminium

sample environment becomes the dominant source of background, signiﬁcantly

increasing the background. This background is slightly reduced by collima-

tor, eliminating the scattered fraction of the cryostat and the backwall of the

aluminium window. However, the sample environment remains the main back-

ground source above the Bragg-edge even in the presence of the collimator.

The measured data are compared with the most realistic case of the simula-

tion, including all the afore described geometrical and instrumental components

as in the case of the ToF and ﬂight distance comparisons (see Section 4.1).

As it is shown in Figures 11a, 12a and 13a, the energy transfer spectra are re-

produced by the simulation in all cases. In the case of 1.0 and 3.678 meV incident

neutrons, below the aluminium Bragg-edge, the simulated background underes-

timates the measured one on both sides of the elastic peak. The discrepancy is

about 80%. In the case of 3.807 meV incident neutrons, above the aluminium

Bragg-edge, the simulated background slightly overestimates the measured one.

The discrepancy is about 20% on the negative and 5% on the positive side of

the elastic peak. The discrepancies in the background are attributed to the

same reasons as for the primary quantities (see Section 4.1). It also has to be

mentioned that the two bumps at 0.25 and 0.5 meV only appear in the mea-

sured energy transfer. This eﬀect is related to the instrument, as it also appears

in the response of local 3He-tubes. Its independence from the presence of the

20

Multi-Grid detector is satisfactorily veriﬁed elsewhere.

In essence the measured and simulated elastic peaks agree well and the

backgrounds reasonably agree at all energies.

ergy (13a) and comparison of the eﬀect of diﬀerent geometrical and instrumental parameters

4.3. Optimisation of the detector vessel window

A study is performed with the CNCS demonstrator model on the eﬀect

of the aluminium window thickness and the vessel components. The window

24

thickness is deﬁned as the sum of the vessel window and the entry grid thickness.

The 0.5 mm grid entry thickness relates to the B4C-coated blade, while bigger

thicknesses indicate the presence of an additional entry blade. The eﬀects of

the other parts of the vessel, the side and the rear end are also considered.

These components either appear with their realistic dimensions or are removed.

Combination of thicknesses are tested and compared in the energy range of 1.0–

8.0 meV in Figure 14. The set of simulated setups and the obtained backgrounds

are presented in Table 3. The simulations are performed with mono-energetic

incident neutrons irradiating the entire detector volume. Sample environment

and tank gas are not present.

Comparing the results in the whole energy range it is shown that except for

the 22 mm total window thickness, which is unrealistically thick, the diﬀerence

in the background is negligible. However, the presence of the side wall causes

a signiﬁcant increase in the background on the positive side of the spectrum.

Therefore, a realistically chosen window thickness practically does not change

the scattered neutron background, but the application of shielding on the inner

wall of the vessel might be considered.

5. Conclusions

This is the ﬁrst time sources of thermal neutron scattering background are

modelled in a detailed simulation of detector response.

A detailed, realistic and ﬂexible Geant4 model of the Multi-Grid detector

is built within the ESS Detector Group Simulation Framework. The model is

validated against measured data from the demonstrators tested at the IN6 at

ILL and the CNCS at SNS. Measured ToF data are reproduced for the IN6

experiment both qualitatively (ToF - detection depth spectra) and quantita-

tively (ToF spectra). The validated model is adopted for a more extensive set

of measurements using a Multi-Grid detector at CNCS, including a more com-

plete setup description. The model is veriﬁed with the comparison of measured

and simulated ToF and ﬂight distance data at 3.678 and 3.807 meV (below and

25

above the aluminium Bragg-edge).

A study is performed with the CNCS model to distinguish the sources of

scattered neutron background. The elastic peak and the scattered neutron back-

ground in the energy transfer are now well-described and well-reproduced with

the model, implying the predictive power of the simulation.

The simulation reveals that the neutron scattering in the detector geometry

is minor in comparison with the eﬀect of the scattering on instrument compo-

nents: the tank gas and the sample environment; these are the major sources of

the measured continuous ﬂat background. The sample environment should also

be considered in the recently built instruments, operating with vacuum tank.

The eﬀect of the detector window thickness is also studied in the range of 0.5 –

22 mm. It is shown that there is no signiﬁcant change in the scattered neutron

background for reasonable window thicknesses. The side of the vessel turns out

to be a higher source of scattered neutron background, that should be taken

into account in the further designs.

The availability of such a simulation allows to build neutron scattering in-

struments with optimised Signal-to-Background ratio by design.
