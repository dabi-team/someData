We show that the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), with signiﬁcant but feasible
new eﬀorts, has the potential to deliver world-leading results in solar neutrinos. With a 100 kton-
year exposure, DUNE could detect (cid:38) 105 signal events above 5 MeV electron energy. Separate
precision measurements of neutrino-mixing parameters and the 8B ﬂux could be made using two
detection channels (νe + 40Ar and νe,µ,τ + e−) and the day-night eﬀect (> 10σ). New particle
physics may be revealed through the comparison of solar neutrinos (with matter eﬀects) and reactor
neutrinos (without), which is discrepant by ∼ 2σ (and could become 5.6σ). New astrophysics may
be revealed through the most precise measurement of the 8B ﬂux (to 2.5%) and the ﬁrst detection
of the hep ﬂux (to 11%). DUNE is required: No other experiment, even proposed, has been shown
capable of fully realizing these discovery opportunities.

Introduction.— Tremendous scientiﬁc opportunities
remain in solar neutrinos. What are the particle prop-
erties of neutrinos? What are the nuclear processes that
power our Sun and other stars? Although the basics are
known [1–6], there are multiple unknowns and discrep-
ancies. To progress, we need precise measurements of all
neutrino-producing processes, plus ways to isolate new
physics from new astrophysics. Here we focus on high
energies (> 5 MeV electron energy).

For particle physics, the primary opportunity is to
test for new physics through a precision comparison of
neutrino-mixing parameters [10–17] measured in solar

versus reactor experiments. Figures 1 and 2 preview this.
There is a ∼ 2-σ discrepancy for ∆m2
21 [6, 7, 18, 19].
The reactor measurement will soon be greatly improved
by the JUNO experiment [8], but testing new physics
depends on improving the solar measurement too. The
contrast in physical conditions is striking: neutrinos ver-
sus antineutrinos, matter versus vacuum mixing, plus a
much larger distance, giving sensitivity to CPT viola-
tion [10, 11], non-standard neutrino interactions [12, 20],
neutrino decay [21, 22], and more.

For astrophysics, the primary opportunity is to make
an independent precise measurement of the 8B ﬂux,

which is extremely sensitive to the solar core tempera-
ture (∼ T 25
[23]), and which is an important ingredient
for resolving the solar-metallicity discrepancy (requiring
also progress on the 7Be and CNO ﬂuxes) [24–28]. Dis-
covery of the hep ﬂux [24–30], the highest-energy neu-
trino process, would probe physical conditions far from
the solar center while still having large matter eﬀects.

How can these opportunities be realized, especially si-
multaneously? This requires a new multi-10-kton scale
experiment, plus breakthroughs in detection strategy.

We propose that DUNE — intended to make trans-
formative studies of GeV long-baseline neutrino mixing,
proton decay, and supernova neutrino bursts [31–33] —
has the potential to do the same for solar neutrinos. The
budgeted plans for DUNE provide a large active volume,
a huge overburden, and excellent technical capabilities,
including at MeV energies (for supernovae) [31–33]. For
solar neutrinos, DUNE would need new investments, de-
tailed below, that would also enhance its planned pro-
grams. Building on prior work on solar-neutrino detec-
tion in liquid argon [34–37], our paper goes much further.
We review the challenges in solar neutrinos, outline our
proposed strategy for DUNE, calculate the signals and
backgrounds, calculate the physics reach, deﬁne techni-
cal requirements, and conclude. To show what DUNE
could achieve, we calculate our main results under opti-
mistic but feasible assumptions; we also discuss the im-
pact of varying these assumptions. In Supplemental Ma-
terial (S.M.) and a separate paper on backgrounds [38],
we provide further details. Further technical studies will
be needed.

Solar neutrinos: status and obstacles.— The fun-
damental challenge in solar neutrinos is disentangling
neutrino-mixing eﬀects and source properties. Super-
Kamiokande (Super-K) and Sudbury Neutrino Observa-
tory (SNO) measurements of 8B neutrinos dominate the
precision of solar determinations of sin2 θ12 and ∆m2
21, as
well as φ(8B), the total 8B ﬂux [5, 6, 15, 39, 40]. The hep
ﬂux, φ(hep) ∼ 10−3 φ(8B), has not been detected [41, 42].
Super-K and SNO measurements are consistent with
an energy independent νe survival probability, Pee (cid:39)
sin2 θ12; the lack of an observed upturn in Pee at low ener-
gies sets a weak upper limit on ∆m2
21 [5, 6]. Within the
theoretical framework of matter-aﬀected neutrino mix-
ing [43–48], these results are consistent with lower-energy
solar neutrino data [1–4]. Two other results were key:

• SNO separately measured φ(8B) and sin2 θ12 using
two channels: νe,µ,τ + d → νe,µ,τ + p + n, which is equally
sensitive to all active ﬂavors, and hence measures the
total ﬂux, and νe + d → e− + p + p, from which they
can then extract the mixing angle. Progress on sin2 θ12
is limited primarily by SNO’s ﬁnal precision for φ(8B)
of (cid:39) 4% ((cid:39) 3% statistical) and partially by the 1.7%
systematic uncertainty on the elastic-scattering channel
in Super-K [5, 6, 15, 39].

• Super-K best constrains ∆m2

21 by measuring the day-
night ﬂux asymmetry (at (cid:39) 3σ) [6] with the νe,µ,τ +e− →
νe,µ,τ + e− channel, where Pee at night is increased by

2

several percent due to the matter eﬀect in Earth [48–51].
Progress is limited by the slow increase in statistics after
20 years of exposure.

Unique advantages of DUNE.— DUNE will be in
the Homestake mine in South Dakota (4300 m.w.e). Each
of two liquid-argon (LAr) modules (eventually four) will
have a ﬁducial mass of 10 kton, surrounded by ∼ 1 m
LAr shielding (details depend on single- or dual-phase).
Readout is by the time-projection technique — here drift-
ing charge deposited in the volume onto wire planes at
the boundaries — plus prompt detection of scintillation
light [31–33, 52].

DUNE can simultaneously measure neutrino-mixing
parameters and solar-neutrino ﬂuxes. Here, we ﬁrst state
our underlying ideas and simple estimates.

• The degeneracy between sin2 θ12 and φ(8B) can be

broken using two detection channels:

νe + 40Ar → e− + 40K∗ ,

where the rate RAr ∝ φ(8B) × sin2 θ12, and

νe,µ,τ + e− → νe,µ,τ + e− ,

(1)

(2)

where Re ∝ φ(8B) × (cid:0)sin2 θ12 + 1
(cid:1). These chan-
nels can be adequately separated with a crude angular
cut. Though the dependence on the νµ,τ content is weak,
DUNE can improve on SNO due to its huge statistics.
Figure 3 illustrates this.

• ∆m2

21. For the solar ∆m2

21 can be isolated through the day-night ﬂux
asymmetry, AD/N = (D − N )/ 1
2 (D + N ), which scales
as ∝ Eν/∆m2
21, an exposure of
100 kton-year, and using only events above 6 MeV elec-
tron energy (eﬀective threshold; see below) and out-
side the forward cone, we expect D = 3.04 × 104 and
N = 3.29 × 104 signal νe + 40Ar events, along with
0.83 × 104 background events in total (as detailed below,
and conservatively including νe,µ,τ + e− events). Con-
sidering for now only statistical uncertainties, we expect
AD/N (cid:39) −(7.9 ± 0.8)% (∼ 10σ). DUNE can improve
on Super-K because the νe + 40Ar channel has a larger
cross section, emphasizes larger neutrino energies, and a
tighter relation between neutrino and electron energy.

Solar neutrinos in DUNE.— The MeV-range ca-
pabilities of DUNE [31–33] are designed for detecting
supernova neutrinos. Above 5 MeV, we assume elec-
trons can be detected with high eﬃciency and 7% energy-
independent energy resolution [33]. For solar signals,
electrons lose energy dominantly by ionization, as the
critical energy of LAr is 32 MeV [54–56]. The angular
resolution of DUNE is uncertain; we adopt 25◦, based on
ICARUS simulations [35]. Below, we discuss the impact
of diﬀerent assumptions.

We use neutrino spectra from Refs. [57, 58] and radial
distributions from the BS05(OP) model of Refs. [25, 26].
As nominal ﬂuxes, we use φ(8B) = 5.25 × 106 cm−2 s−1
(4% uncertainty; from SNO [5]) and φ(hep) = 8.25 ×
103 cm−2 s−1 (30% uncertainty; from theory [28, 30]).
The endpoint energies are (cid:39) 15 and (cid:39) 19 MeV.

background ratios for both event categories in the cone
away from the Sun and its complement. Inside the cone,
which includes 81% of νe,µ,τ + e− events [35], they dom-
inate; outside the cone, which includes 88% of νe + 40Ar
events, they dominate.

In principle, DUNE could use the neutral-current (NC)
channel νe,µ,τ + 40Ar → νe,µ,τ + 40Ar∗, where the ﬁnal
state is detected through nuclear gamma rays [67, 69, 76].
We treat this as a background because the cross section
seems small.
If not, this could be an important new
signal.

Backgrounds must be mitigated with standard MeV-
detector techniques: deﬁning a ﬁducial volume, remov-
ing U/Th from liquids and Rn from air, selecting low-
background materials, applying deadtime after high-
energy events, etc. [1–8, 77, 78]. Three important back-
grounds will remain (details in S.M. and Ref.
[38]).
First, neutron captures on 40Ar, releasing a total of
6.1 MeV in several gamma rays [79–81]; these Comp-
ton scatter or pair-produce electrons. These neutrons,
most less than a few MeV, are dominantly produced by
(α, n) interactions in the rock following U/Th-chain de-
cays [35, 82, 83]; muon-induced neutrons are relatively
negligible [38]. Once neutrons enter the detector, they ﬁll
the volume, due to their small cross section on argon. We
assume a hermetic, passive water (/oil/plastic) shield of
40-cm thickness, reducing this background by ∼ 4 × 103.
Below, we show that even no shielding is acceptable. Sec-
ond, neutral-current νe,µ,τ + 40Ar events cause a peak
near 9 MeV [76]. Third, at the highest energies, beta-
decaying radioactivities induced by muons [38, 84–86],
for which we apply simple cuts. The pileup rates from
these and other backgrounds (e.g., 39Ar and 42Ar decays)
are negligible [38].

Figure 4 shows the solar-neutrino signal and back-
ground spectra in DUNE. Our calculations include three-
ﬂavor neutrino mixing [43–50], realistic detection eﬀects
(diﬀerential cross sections [68, 87–89], energy smearing,
angular cuts [35], background reduction [74, 90–103]),
and a 100 kton-year exposure.

For 8B events, the two channels are well separated and
have superb yields above 5 MeV electron energy. For
νe + 40Ar, there are 9.9 × 104 events outside the forward
cone. For νe,µ,τ +e−, there are 2.6×104 events inside the
forward cone. This channel provides better sensitivity to
lower-energy neutrinos and the only sensitivity to νµ,τ .
For hep events, the νe + 40Ar channel allows a clear sep-
aration at high electron energies, with 150 events above
11 MeV (the small νe,µ,τ + e− channel is not shown).

DUNE physics reach.— DUNE can signiﬁcantly
improve the precision of solar neutrino observables. We
sin2 θ12,
jointly ﬁt (without priors) four parameters:
∆m2
21, φ(8B), φ(hep). When reporting projected uncer-
tainties for n parameters, we marginalize over the others,
adopting ∆χ2 conﬁdence levels for n d.o.f. We assume
that new physics aﬀecting solar neutrinos is reﬂected in
mixing-parameter values that diﬀer from the reactor val-
ues. We use the theoretically expected counts for signals

FIG. 3. Estimated precision of the νe and νµ,τ content of the
8B ﬂux, present (SNO [5, 53]) and future (DUNE), with the
ellipse for DUNE alone. Based on a simpliﬁed analysis, with
only statistical uncertainties (1σ) but assuming 2 d.o.f., and
with SNO ﬂuxes slightly rescaled to match their global-ﬁt 8B
ﬂux. Note small axis ranges. Full analysis in text.

For the charged-current (CC) channel νe + 40Ar [59–
73], the ground state threshold is Qgs = 1.5 MeV [74],
but this transition is forbidden. The cross section is dom-
inated by transitions to nuclear excited states in 40K∗
(a super-allowed Fermi transition with ∆Ei = 4.4 MeV,
plus several Gamow-Teller transitions), which promptly
produce gamma rays by nuclear de-excitation. Due to
these nuclear thresholds, DUNE is most sensitive to
Eν (cid:38) 9 MeV. We deﬁne the detectable energy of an event
as the electron kinetic energy Te, given by Te = Eν − Q,
where Q = Qgs + ∆Ei, conservatively neglecting the de-
tectability of the ∆Ei in gamma rays (if these gamma
rays were detectable, that would dramatically improve
event identiﬁcation, background rejection, energy recon-
struction, and sensitivity). The electrons are emitted
near-isotropically. Details, including cross section uncer-
tainties, are discussed below and in S.M.

For the elastic-scattering (ES) channel νe,µ,τ + e−,
there is no threshold and the cross section is known with
sub-percent precision [75]. All ﬂavors participate, but
the sensitivity to the νµ,τ content is reduced, as these
have only neutral-current couplings. DUNE is sensitive
to Eν (cid:38) 5 MeV, though the broad diﬀerential cross sec-
tion eﬀectively raises that. The direction of the scattered
electron is well correlated to the neutrino direction, with
a maximum scattering angle of about 20◦. We adequately
separate νe,µ,τ + e− and νe + 40Ar events by deﬁning a
forward cone of half-angle 40◦, maximizing the signal to

and backgrounds, with Poisson uncertainties (below, we
discuss systematics). We partition data into bins of en-
ergy, bins of Earth zenith angle (night only), and out-
side/inside the forward cone (as in Fig. 4). We use the to-
tal electron spectra, assuming only statistical separation
of the components, and not requiring neutrino-energy re-
construction.

Figure 2 shows the projected precision for DUNE’s
measurement of neutrino mixing parameters, assuming
the solar best-ﬁt values (sin2 θ12 = 0.308, ∆m2
21 = 4.85 ×
10−5 eV2 [6]). The uncertainties are 3.0% and 5.9%, a
factor of (cid:39) 1.5 and (cid:39) 3 better than from all solar ex-
periments to date, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. The
sensitivity to ∆m2
21 comes primarily from the day-night
eﬀect (10.4σ). The 8B ﬂux (marginalizing over other pa-
rameters) can be measured to 2.5%, a factor (cid:39) 1.6 better
than from SNO. DUNE can make a robust ﬁrst detection
of hep neutrinos, with a precision of 11%, a factor (cid:39) 3
better than the current theoretical uncertainty.

Going forward.— New investments are needed to
enhance the MeV capabilities of DUNE. At the trigger
level, this includes enhancing data acquisition, storage,
and processing for a steady rate of MeV events. Cali-
bration at MeV energies across the detector volume will
be crucial to controlling systematics. An enhanced light-
detection system would enhance MeV detection.

Backgrounds must be controlled, and the biggest con-
cern, after standard cuts [1–8, 77, 78], is neutron cap-
tures [38]. We see three possible strategies.

1. 40 cm of shielding, as assumed above. This allows a

low threshold ((cid:39) 5.8 MeV) to test for shape distortions in
the spectrum and to enhance particle-identiﬁcation tech-
niques.

2. Additional runtime. With less or no shielding, the
eﬀective analysis threshold would be higher. This can be
compensated by a larger exposure than 100 kton-year.
With 30, 20, 10, or 0 cm of shielding, the eﬀective anal-
ysis threshold is (cid:39) 6.2, 6.5, 6.9, or 7.2 MeV, and the ex-
posure needed for comparable results increases at most
of a factor of ∼ 2.

3. Better particle-identiﬁcation techniques. We as-
sume neutrino-interaction events and neutron-capture
events with the same electron energy are indistinguish-
able. This is too conservative because νe,µ,τ + e−,
νe + 40Ar, and neutron-capture events would have one
electron, an electron with gammas, and multiple gam-
mas, respectively. For gamma rays, the radiation length
is 14 cm and Compton-scattering dominates [54], so these
event classes should be distinct.

The impact of varying the assumptions made above
is detailed in S.M. Here we summarize some key points.
The sensitivity to ∆m2
21 is very robust because it is de-
termined from the day-night eﬀect, which cancels many
inputs. The uncertainty on the νe + 40Ar cross section
(presently 10%) and the detector systematics should be
reduced to 1%. Without this, DUNE alone cannot break
the degeneracy between sin2 θ12 and φ(8B), though its
measurement of ∆m2
21 would be unaﬀected and its mea-
surement of φ(hep) only be modestly aﬀected.
Impor-
tantly, the intended precision of sin2 θ12 and φ(8B) could

If the energy resolution is 20%, the intended precision of
φ(hep) would degrade to 18%, though that of sin2 θ12,
φ(8B) and ∆m2
21 could be largely restored by increas-
ing exposure by ∼2. DUNE’s sensitivity would be lost
if the energy resolution is poor and backgrounds are not
reduced.

Concluding perspectives.— This is the ﬁrst study
to detail how DUNE, with a new, challenging but feasi-
ble solar-neutrino program, would open substantial dis-
covery space in both particle physics and astrophysics.
With DUNE’s precision measurements of sin2 θ12 and
∆m2
21, the comparison to JUNO’s may reveal new par-
ticle physics of neutrinos. Simultaneously, with DUNE’s
precision measurements of φ(8B) and φ(hep), it may re-
veal new astrophysics. Further studies are needed to eval-
uate our proposal and to optimize its sensitivity.

No other planned experiment has been shown poten-
tially capable of meeting all of these goals. Of pro-
posed experiments, Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) [104,
105] stands out, and it can nicely complement DUNE.
Hyper-K would have only one channel, νe,µ,τ + e−, but
huge statistics. DUNE and Hyper-K would measure
∆m2
21 (from the day-night asymmetry) comparably well.
Hyper-K would have a signiﬁcant advantage on measur-
ing the upturn in the νe survival probability. DUNE
would measure φ(hep) much better. Their combined im-
pact would be signiﬁcantly enhanced by new experiments
for low-energy solar neutrinos [36, 106, 107].

Solar neutrino studies, begun long ago, are not done.

DUNE can lead the next generation of discoveries.

Here we provide additional details. Appendix A fo-
cuses on the νe + 40Ar charged-current cross section, Ap-
pendix B on our calculation of detector backgrounds for
DUNE, Appendix C on our calculations of DUNE’s sen-
sitivity to solar neutrinos, and Appendix D on examples
of how our results change under diﬀerent assumptions.

Appendix A. SIGNAL CROSS SECTION

To exploit the full potential of a solar-neutrino pro-

gram in DUNE, the total cross section for

νe + 40Ar → e− + 40K∗,

(A1)

when convolved with the 8B spectrum and a detector
threshold of Te = 5 MeV, should be known to ∼ 1%.
With a larger uncertainty, DUNE alone can still precisely
measure ∆m2
21 and φ(hep); DUNE in combination with
other experiments can also still precisely measure sin2 θ12
and φ(8B). See Sec. D 2.

A cross-section uncertainty of (cid:46) 2.4% has been claimed
based on indirect measurements, though our assessment
below suggests that (cid:46) 10% is more realistic. Importantly,
the uncertainty is unlikely to be worse than that. Al-
though this may be surprising, based on the larger un-
certainties for neutrino-nucleus interactions at GeV en-
ergies, the physics at these low energies is much simpler.
Our conclusions are robust to possible changes in the
central value of the cross section. For example, a 10%
change in the cross section and thus signal counts would
change signiﬁcances of measured parameters by (cid:39) 5%.
Only the scale of its uncertainty is important.

A precise determination of the cross section is chal-
lenging but realistic. There are ways to reduce the un-
certainty on the cross section, including through a ﬁrst
direct measurement.

A.1 Details of Calculations

We ﬁrst state the form of the cross section we use,
which follows Ref. [68], which presents the most recent
indirect measurements. At leading order, the total cross
section is

σ(Eν) =

G2

where i indexes transitions from the ground state of 40Ar
to distinct relevant nuclear excited states in 40K, collec-
tively denoted with a * (transitions to its ground state
are forbidden by selection rules). The i-dependent terms
are the amplitude squared, phase space (Ee is the elec-
tron’s total energy and pe = veEe (cid:39) Ee its momentum),
and Fermi function F (to account for Coulomb eﬀects).

TABLE I. Transition strengths for νe+ 40Ar → e−+ 40K∗ [68].
Here we have multiplied the Bi(GT) values by the axial cou-
pling constant squared (with gA = −1.26), so that they have
the same normalization as Bi(F), as appropriate for Ref. [68].
In the literature, it is not always clearly noted if Bi(GT) val-
ues are normalized with or without this factor. The energy of
the Fermi state is taken from Ref. [61].

GF,β is the Fermi constant for beta decay (see below)
and Vud is the quark mixing matrix element. For each
nuclear transition, which could, in principle, be identiﬁed
by the total gamma-ray energy, the neutrino spectrum is
sampled faithfully, weighted by cross section and shifted
by the nuclear threshold.

For the ﬁnal states we consider, the transition ampli-

tudes squared can be expressed as

|Mo→i|2 = Bi(F) + Bi(GT),

(A3)

where the transitions are of the Fermi or Gamow-Teller
type, or mixed [59]. For allowed Fermi transitions, which
correspond to the vector part of the weak current, the
leptons have total spin zero and the change in the nuclear
total angular momentum is zero. For allowed Gamow-
Teller transitions, which correspond to the axial-vector
part of the weak current, the leptons have total spin one
and the change in the nuclear total angular momentum
is one or zero (but not 0 → 0). For νe + 40Ar, the
transitions are seemingly not mixed and the only relevant
Fermi transition is super-allowed, with its strength given
by a sum rule, B(F) = N − Z = 4 (deﬁned for the parent
nucleus) [60, 68]. For the Gamow-Teller strengths, we
use those based on measurements of 40Ar(p, n)40K∗ in
forward-angle kinematics [68]. See Table I.

Because the interaction is a 2-to-2 process and the nu-
clear transitions are between discrete states, the kine-
matics and the phase-space factor are simple. (Recoil-
order corrections are (cid:46) 5 keV, and can be neglected.)

tion of the Dirac equation for an electron in the poten-
tial of a ﬁnite-sized nucleus, is tabulated in Table II of
Ref. [68, 87]. Figure A1 shows our interpolated result,
which diﬀers from the simple analytic expression [88] by
being ∼ 10% larger and by varying at large momenta,
both of which are important.

Figure A2 shows the total cross section for νe + 40Ar,
combining the factors above,
including the detector
threshold of Te = 5 MeV. At Eν = 10 MeV, a typi-
cal energy, the relevant cross section is σ ≈ 3 × 10−42
cm2, a factor ∼ 30 larger than that for νe + e−, though
the latter’s density of targets is 18 times higher. The
νe + 40Ar cross section grows rapidly, faster than σ ∝
E2
+ 5 MeV + me)2, because with in-
creasing neutrino energy, more nuclear thresholds are sur-
passed, and because of the strong eﬀect of the detector
threshold. In our calculations, we do not use this total
cross section; instead, we sum the partial cross sections
for each independent transition.

e ∝ (Eν − Ethr,i

ν

FIG. A1. Fermi function for νe + 40Ar → e− + 40K∗ in terms
of electron momentum, interpolated from data in Ref. [68, 87].
The shaded region indicates the approximate range of interest.

The electron kinetic energy is Te = Eν − Qi, where
Qi = Qgs + ∆Ei, with Qgs = 1.504 MeV the reac-
tion threshold to reach the ground state of 40K (in-
cluding creation of the electron) and ∆Ei the excita-
tion energy above that [68, 74]. We assume a detec-
tion threshold of Te = 5 MeV, conservatively neglect-
ing the detectability of nuclear de-excitation gamma rays
(of total energy ∆Ei), which primarily undergo Comp-
ton scattering, and may be detectable in coincidence,
improving particle and reaction identiﬁcation. For a
neutrino interaction to register, its energy must exceed
Ethr,i
= (Qgs + ∆Ei) + 5 MeV, which is 8.837 MeV for
ν
the lowest allowed transition and higher for others. The
electron angular distribution, dσ/d cos θ, is ∝ 1 + cos θ
for Fermi transitions and ∝ 1 − 1
3 cos θ for Gamow-Teller
transitions [62, 63]. For an isotropic angular distribution,
the fraction of νe + 40Ar events outside the forward cone
is 88%. Taking into account the weighting of diﬀerent
transitions does not change this number appreciably.

The Fermi function F accounts for the distortion of
the outgoing electron wave function due to its Coulomb
interaction with the nuclear charge Z (deﬁned for the
daughter nucleus) [87–89]. For an outgoing electron, the
interaction is attractive, making F > 1, and, in this case,
the correction is substantial, a factor (cid:39) 1.6. A commonly
used analytic estimate, F (cid:39) 2πν/[1 − exp(−2πν)], with
ν = Zα/ve, based on the solution to the Schr¨oedinger
equation for an electron in the potential of a point-like
nucleus, is only suitable for small Z [88]. At high mo-
mentum, this is a constant; at low momentum, it varies
as 1/ve. A detailed calculation of F , based on the solu-

Figure A3 shows how diﬀerent transitions contribute
to the total cross section, now showing only the case
where the detector threshold of Te = 5 MeV is applied
to each transition separately. The relative contributions
vary depending on their strengths compared to those
of all other kinematically accessible transitions. Below
Eν = 10.888 MeV, corresponding to the threshold for
the super-allowed Fermi transition, the cross section is
dominated by the two lowest-energy Gamow-Teller tran-
sitions. For higher Eν, there are four comparable con-
tributions: each of the two lowest-energy Gamow-Teller
transitions, the Fermi transition, and the sum of all
other kinematically accessible Gamow-Teller transitions.
(Though we do not exploit the angular distribution, do-
ing so [62, 63] would increase sensitivity.)

In principle, there are additional contributions to the
νe + 40Ar total cross section from particle-unbound ﬁnal
states, e.g., e− + 39Ar + p and e− + 39K + n. However,
even if the transition strengths are appreciable, the nu-
clear thresholds are above 9 MeV [74], making the neu-
trino thresholds above 14 MeV, and even higher if we
account for the energy of the outgoing nucleons. For a
given neutrino energy, Te will be substantially lower than
for the particle-bound transitions, burying any additional
contributions in the falling total spectra of Fig. 3.

A.2 Assessment of Uncertainties

To assess the uncertainty on the cross section, we ﬁrst
consider two data-based evaluations. The Bi(GT) val-
ues we use are from the 40Ar(p, n)40K∗ data of Ref. [68].
For the uncertainties, we focus on the strengths them-
selves, though there may also be uncertainties in the ex-
citation energies (through identiﬁcation of the relevant
transitions). Though the uncertainties on individual Bi
are ∼ 5–20%, the uncertainty on the summed strength

paper preceding Ref. [68], a related group of authors
obtained Bi(F + GT) values based on measurements of
40Ti β+ decay to 40Sc∗, the isospin mirror process for
νe + 40Ar → e− + 40K∗, with an uncertainty of 2.1% on
the summed strength [61]. However, there are discrep-
ancies between the two techniques, with the convolved
cross sections at the most important energies diﬀering at
the ∼ 10% level. It is diﬃcult to assess the systematics,
as the two techniques access somewhat diﬀerent transi-
tions, and both rely on some assumptions: for the (p, n)
data, that the weak transitions are in the same propor-
tions as the strong transitions; for the beta-decay data,
that isospin symmetry holds. A shell-model study [72]
suggests that the (p, n) data are preferred over the beta-
decay data, which is one of the reasons we adopted the
strengths from Ref. [68]. Further work is needed to re-
solve diﬀerences between the two techniques.

The cross section can also be evaluated using Bi values
calculated with nuclear theory [60, 66, 67, 69, 70]. For the
low energies of solar neutrinos, the preferred technique is
the nuclear shell model, treating most of the nucleons as
belonging to a closed core, and treating the remaining
valence nucleons as subject to an eﬀective potential from
the core as well as to a residual nucleon-nucleon inter-
action. For the higher energies of supernova neutrinos,

the preferred technique is the random phase approxima-
tion (RPA), which describes collective states of nuclei in
a basis of particle-hole excitations. A hybrid approach
is also possible, with RPA used to calculate transitions
not well described by the shell model. Compared to our
calculation, the hybrid calculation of Ref. [70], which we
consider to be the most reliable, is (cid:39) 10% smaller. How-
ever, its Bi values for known important low-lying tran-
sitions fall well below the data of Ref. [68], allowing its
cross section to be smaller, despite the additional contri-
butions of RPA-calculated transitions ((cid:46) 10% at solar-
neutrino energies). We neglect the results of some other
calculations: the early shell-model calculation of Ref. [60]
((cid:39) 30% smaller than ours, but it omits relevant nuclear
operators) and the RPA calculations of Refs. [66, 67, 69]
(a factor of a few diﬀerence, but they are not suited for
the solar-neutrino energy range). New work is needed on
all of these techniques.

Thus, based on both experimental and theoretical eval-
uations of the cross section, its uncertainty (for 8B neu-
trinos in DUNE) is likely (cid:46) 10%. This is small enough
that our conclusions are robust, but large enough that
new eﬀorts to reduce uncertainties are needed.

A.3 Towards Reducing Uncertainties

Even without new experimental data, it seems likely
that the cross-section uncertainty can be reduced through
new theoretical work: calculations of the Bi, calcula-
tions to help reconcile diﬀerences in experimental inputs,

clude all known eﬀects. These eﬀects include corrections
that, while not all uncertainties per se, cause discrep-
ancies between diﬀerent results if they are not applied
uniformly, of which we give several examples, following
e.g., Refs. [63–65, 71, 89]. The inner radiative corrections
for charged-current semi-leptonic processes with nucle-
ons increase the cross section by (cid:39) 2.4%, which can be
absorbed into a change in the Fermi constant for beta
decay (GF,β) relative to that measured from muon decay
(GF ). The outer radiative corrections can also increase
the cross section by ∼ 1–2%, depending on the nucleus
and how the energy deposition by bremsstrahlung aﬀects
the detectability of the electron. In principle, updating
the value of the axial coupling constant from gA = −1.26
to the contemporary −1.27 would also increase the cross
section by (cid:39) 2%, but gA may be quenched in nuclei. In
addition, the eﬀects of the following should also be con-
sidered:
isospin-violation corrections, subdominant ar-
gon isotopes (0.4%), particle-unbound transitions, for-
bidden transitions, more accurate identiﬁcations of the
energies of the relevant nuclear transitions, and so on.

To reduce the uncertainty to < 1%, new data are
needed, starting with comprehensive new measurements
of auxiliary data to evaluate Bi, e.g., from 40Ar(p, n)40K∗
and 40Ti β+ decay.
It seems likely that new measure-
ments, supported by theoretical eﬀorts, could ensure that
these techniques reach their intended precision.

Ultimately, the νe + 40Ar cross section must be di-
rectly measured with a laboratory source of neutrinos,
which has never been done. Achieving an uncertainty
< 1% will require the statistics of (cid:38) 104 events and com-
mensurate control of systematics. The neutrino source
could be accelerator-produced µ+ decay at rest, for which
the νe spectrum, before weighting with the rising cross
section, peaks at (cid:39) 35 MeV. At this energy, the total
charged-current cross section is (cid:39) 300 × 10−42 cm2, tak-
ing into account only the nuclear transitions noted above;
the true cross section will be larger. At the location of
the suite of COHERENT neutrino detectors at the Spal-
lation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge, the time-averaged
νe ﬂux is (cid:39) 107 cm−2 s−1 [73]. We thus estimate that
an exposure of ∼ 10 ton-year is needed. With a low
detection threshold and good collection of scintillation
light, the nuclear transition of each interaction could be
identiﬁed by the total energy of its de-excitation gamma
rays, which would reduce backgrounds. If systematics are
more challenging than statistics, then identifying speciﬁc
nuclear transitions by their gamma rays could be used
to measure relative strengths (including compared to the
super-allowed Fermi transition) instead of the absolute
cross section. There would be numerous technical chal-
lenges, but the importance of the problem encourages
signiﬁcant investments.

Appendix B. BACKGROUNDS

For the detection of MeV neutrinos, backgrounds must
be seriously considered. Standard techniques developed
for previous solar-neutrino and other experiments can
powerfully reduce backgrounds. These include deﬁning
a ﬁducial volume, removing U/Th from liquids and Rn
from air, selecting low-background materials, applying
a short deadtime after high-energy events, and so on.
There are some special aspects of MeV backgrounds in
DUNE due to its target material, its readout technology,
its unusual depth, and the fact that it is a target for GeV
accelerator-produced neutrinos. We review some back-
grounds that will be unimportant after standard cuts,
then provide details on three that will remain important.
We ﬁrst discuss the expected livetime fraction for
DUNE for MeV neutrinos, i.e., when the detector is quiet
from high-energy events or their aftermaths. Following
a high-energy event, the produced charge takes (cid:39) 2–
3 ms to drift out of the volume [31–33]. High-energy
events can be created by atmospheric muons (0.05 Hz per
10 kton [33, 38]) and neutrinos from the Fermilab beam
((cid:39) 1 Hz, with duration (cid:39) 10 µs [32], though the expected
number of interactions per spill is tiny). In a conserva-
tive case, in which we apply a holdoﬀ of 10 ms every 1 s,
this induces a detector deadtime of only (cid:39) 1%. As dis-
cussed below, this is enough time that any neutrons cre-
ated have escaped or captured; long-lived beta-decaying
isotopes must be treated separately. The expected expo-
sure of DUNE for MeV events, i.e., when the detector is
quiet, is thus nearly the same as the calendar time.

Other neutrino ﬂuxes can be ignored. The ﬂuxes of
MeV atmospheric neutrinos [100, 101] and the Diﬀuse Su-
pernova Neutrino Background [102, 103] are even smaller
than that of hep neutrinos. The reactor ﬂux [96, 99] is
comparable to the 8B ﬂux, but the high threshold [74]
for ¯νe events on 40Ar, combined with the low energies of
reactor neutrinos, make this irrelevant. For GeV atmo-
spheric neutrinos, they can be vetoed as above.

We expect that betas and gammas from intrinsic ra-
dioactivities [35] can be mitigated eﬀectively,
leaving
a negligible rate inside the ﬁducial volume and above
5 MeV. These long-lived radioactivities have low ener-
gies, but can eﬀectively reach higher energies if their
rate is high and/or the energy resolution is poor. Stan-
dard MeV techniques such as U/Th removal from the
liquid, Rn removal from the air, and selection of low-
radioactivity material can signiﬁcantly lower background
rates. Good energy resolution (7%) will ensure that the
end-point energies of both 42K (3.53 MeV, from the 42Ar
decay chain [74]) and 214Bi (3.27 MeV, from the 222Rn
decay chain [74]) are too low to aﬀect the solar analy-
sis. We also considered backgrounds due to pileup, i.e.,
time and space coincidences of multiple events that could
mimic a single event of higher energy. For the decays of
42Ar (42K) or 39Ar (endpoint 0.57 MeV) [33, 35], or the
capture of external neutrons (even without shielding),
the rates are negligible. Pileup for these and other cases

FIG. A4. Spectra of major possible backgrounds. Note the large range on the y-axes. Left: Assuming 7% energy resolution
(as in our main results). Right: Assuming 20% energy resolution (as in the alternate cases considered below). The spallation
backgrounds are taken from Ref. [38] and the neutron backgrounds are calculated below. For 39Ar and 42Ar (42K) decays, we
assume rates of 107 Hz and 103 Hz per module, respectively [31–33, 38]. For the 222Rn activity, we assume that ∼ 10 mBq/m3
can be achieved in steady state (for comparison, in Super-K the pre-puriﬁcation level was about ∼ 50 times worse than that;
the post-puriﬁcation level is a few to several times better than that, depending on depth in the detector [77]).

is discussed in detail in Ref. [38].

Figure A4 shows, for initial orientation, the spectra of
several major possible backgrounds under two assump-
tions about energy resolution. These results show that
the most important background above 5 MeV electron
energy is due to neutron radiative captures. These re-
sults also show that low-energy radioactivities are much
less important, even with poor energy resolution. If their
rates were an order of magnitude higher than our esti-
mates, they still would not have an impact on our anal-
ysis. We thus move on to a more detailed discussion of
the backgrounds above 5 MeV electron energy.

Figure A5 shows the three components of the back-
ground that will remain signiﬁcant after cuts. In Fig. 3,
the total background yields (after cuts) outside and in-
side the forward cone are 14.0 × 104 and 1.9 × 104, re-
spectively. As in the main text, we discuss them in order
of increasing energy and decreasing importance. At the
end of this section, we comment on the potential impact
of particle-identiﬁcation techniques.

B.1 Neutron Backgrounds From Radioactivities

The dominant background is due to MeV neutrons
originating in the surrounding rock.
(In Ref. [38], we
show that neutrons produced by muons are much less im-

portant; see Fig. 12 there.) The neutrons are produced
in (α, n) reactions generated by 238U or 232Th daugh-
ter decays as well as through the spontaneous ﬁssion of
238U. Once neutrons enter the active volume, they mostly
elastically scatter with argon. Within a few ms, they
either exit the detector or undergo radiative capture on
argon, producing multiple gamma rays with energy up to
6.1 MeV, the total energy release [79–81]. Gamma rays
then Compton-scatter or pair-produce electrons with en-
ergies up to the maximum gamma-ray energy, creating
signal-like events. (External gamma rays from the same
processes, which we calculate, are signiﬁcantly less im-
portant, due to the ﬁducial-volume cut.)

These neutrons cannot be rejected by the ﬁducial vol-
ume cut because neutrons below 5–10 MeV (above which
inelastic cross sections become large) do not lose much
energy through elastic scattering on argon: neutrons can
travel ∼ 100 meters in LAr before they capture. (In the
Sudbury Neutrino Observatory phase with pure D2O,
the neutron-capture distance was long because capture
was ineﬃcient while energy loss through elastic scatter-
ing was eﬃcient; here, it is the opposite.) In our nominal
analysis, we assume 40 cm of water or other hydroge-
nous shielding, which must be kept radiopure but which
can be passive. Roughly, each 10 cm of water reduces
the neutron background by somewhat less than an order
of magnitude. Note that comparable sensitivity can be

achieved with no shielding and twice the exposure.

This background rate depends on the type of rock sur-
rounding the detector. The DUNE far detector will be
placed at the 4850 feet level in the Homestake Gold
Mine [32],
located in Lead, South Dakota. At this
level, the rock belongs mostly to the Poorman forma-
tion [32, 94, 95, 97]. The Poorman rock has an av-
erage concentration of 238U of 3.43 ppm and 232Th of
7.11 ppm [90], which we adopt for our calculation. This is
a conservative choice, because some samples of the Poor-
man rock, in particular those in the Yates unit, are known
to possess a sub-ppm concentration of U/Th [90], as is the
case for Davis Campus where LUX is hosted [83]. Based
on a survey reported in Ref. [32], we neglect the presence
of rhyolite, which might increase the radioactive contam-
ination. Regarding the concentration of other elements,
we adopt the average values for the Poorman formation
reported in Table 1 in Ref. [90]. This is also a conserva-
tive assumption, because the average water (OH radicals
and actual water) content is ∼ 4%, whereas some sam-
ples show ﬂuctuations up to 10%, which would lower the
neutron level. The rock composition we adopt is reported
in Table II.

We prepared dedicated simulations to assess the neu-
tron backgrounds. For neutrons produced through (α, n)
interactions, which are the most important, we use the
simulation package NeuCBOT [98] to get the neutron
yield and spectrum. To calculate the neutron rate from
spontaneous ﬁssion, we approximate the neutron spec-
trum using using the Watt distribution [35, 82, 83, 91],
and take the neutron yield per ﬁssion to be 2 [91]. We

propagate neutrons through rock, water shielding, the
active volume, and ﬁnally the ﬁducial volume of the de-
tector using the simulation package FLUKA [92, 93]. We
then record all neutron captures in the ﬁducial volume.
Last, we convert the gamma ray spectrum from neutron
captures [79–81] to an electron spectrum by simulating
gamma rays in FLUKA. We then record the electron ki-
netic energy for Compton scattering and the total kinetic
energy for pair production. The most important contri-
bution to this background is neutrons of a few MeV.

There are also neutrons produced inside the detector,
from (α, n) reactions generated the decay chain of 222Rn
that has diﬀused into the LAr from the rock. For a
222Rn activity of ∼ 1 mBq/m3 in the liquid, which has
been achieved or improved upon in other detectors fol-
lowing air-puriﬁcation procedures [77, 78], we ﬁnd that
this background is negligible. We neglect backgrounds
that follow from the decay chains of U/Th in the detec-
tor, as LAr can be easily puriﬁed [36].

B.2 Neutrino-Argon Neutral-Current
Interactions

Neutrino neutral-current interactions with argon pro-

duce an excited state of the argon nucleus:

νe,µ,τ + 40Ar → νe,µ,τ + 40Ar∗ ,

(B1)

where the de-excitation gamma rays might be tagged.
Because there is only one shell-model calculation of
neutral-current cross section [76], that is what we adopt.
We calculate the cross section based on Eqs. (1, 2) and
Table I in Ref. [76]. In this case, there are three excited
states of argon, at 6.1, 9.6, and 10.42 MeV. The ﬁrst two
states emit gamma rays at the corresponding excitation
energies, whereas the 10.42 MeV state leads to emission

It is diﬃcult to access the uncertainty on the cross
section. The only shell-model calculation [76] diﬀers sig-
niﬁcantly from two RPA calculations [67, 69]. One of
those [67] has a cross section that is almost a factor of 10
larger than the shell-model calculation. If that were cor-
rect, there would be a chance to turn the neutral-current
channel into a signal, which would be valuable because it
would detect the νµ,τ component of the solar ﬂux at full
strength, unlike the elastic-scattering channel. A back-
ground to the neutral-current channel would be charged-
current events with the electron below threshold but the
gamma-ray above. Further theoretical and experimental
investigation is needed.

B.3 Cosmic-Ray Muon-Induced Backgrounds

When a cosmic-ray muon passes through the detector
(for each module, the total rate is 0.05 Hz [33, 38]), it can
rarely produce a large shower along its track. Secondary
particles, especially pions and neutrons, may break ar-
gon nuclei and produce beta-unstable isotopes. These
isotopes subsequently beta decay and produce electrons,
mimicking neutrino signals. They are called spallation
backgrounds (see, e.g., Refs [84–86]).

Due to the low muon rate in DUNE, spallation back-
grounds can be eﬃciently reduced by simple cuts to re-
ject delayed events following muons. A per-module cut
of duration 250 ms, followed by a cylinder cut of radius
2.5 m and duration 40 s, induces a deadtime of only 5%.
The ﬁrst cut decimates short-lived radioactivities (and
neutrons, which capture in a few ms), and the second
greatly reduces isotopes that are longer-lived. Above
10 MeV, where spallation is most relevant, these cuts
reduce the spallation background by (cid:39) 99.5%, which is
taken into account in Fig. 3. More sophisticated cuts
can further reduce the backgrounds while maintaining
low deadtime [38].

Muons that interact only in the nearby rock do not
pose a problem. The neutrons they produce are subdomi-
nant to those produced by radioactivities in the rock [38].
Showers induced by the muons may enter the detector,
producing spallation isotopes, but these instances will
be reduced by the ﬁducial-volume cut and our simula-
tions show that they can be identiﬁed by the presence of
charged shower particles entering the detector. Simple
cuts, similar to those above, will be suﬃcient.

B.4 Particle-Identiﬁcation Techniques

If signals and backgrounds could be separated by
particle-identiﬁcation techniques, that would increase the
sensitivity of the solar neutrino program. As noted
above, νe,µ,τ + e−, νe + 40Ar, and neutron-capture events
would have one electron, an electron with gammas, and
multiple gammas, respectively. For gamma rays, the ra-

14

diation length is 14 cm and Compton-scattering domi-
nates [54], so these event classes should be distinct.

Once a single electron from a νe + 40Ar event above
5 MeV has triggered the detector, it should be possible to
reconstruct, using time and space coincidences, at least
some of the lower-energy electrons produced by gamma
rays in association. These gamma rays carry a substan-
tial amount of energy; see Table I, where the ∆Ei values
are 2.3 MeV or larger. In principle, this technique could
be even employed for events in which the primary and
secondary electrons are all individually below 5 MeV, but
above in total. The presence of these gamma rays would
strongly favor that an event is due to νe + 40Ar. For
νe,µ,τ + e− events, gamma rays can be produced through
bremsstrahlung, but that is suppressed because the event
energies are well below the critical energy of 32 MeV [54–
56]. And for neutron capture, it typically produces sev-
eral gamma rays, with total energy 6.1 MeV [79–81].
However, induced electrons above 5 MeV are dominantly
produced by a single 5.6-MeV gamma ray; we assume
that the remaining 0.5 MeV in gamma rays is unde-
tectable, even in coincidence. Further study is needed
to assess the the potential to separate these event classes
from each other (as well as from the less-important back-
grounds due to νe,µ,τ + 40Ar events and spallation beta
decays).

The impact of particle-identiﬁcation techniques for
νe + 40Ar events would be even greater if the energy

deposited via gamma rays could be estimated.
main analysis, we conservatively assumed that the only
detectable energy in an event is due to single electrons
above 5 MeV. Figure A6 shows how Fig. 3 would be im-
proved if, for νe + 40Ar events, the measurable energy
was the full neutrino energy instead of only the leading
electron energy. This would allow separation of νe + 40Ar
events from νe,µ,τ + e− events and backgrounds. Perfect
separation is an unrealistic ideal, but this ﬁgure gives a
sense of the beneﬁts that would follow from being able
to reconstruct at least some of the energy deposited in
gamma rays. We use the full neutrino energy to account
for both the measurable energy deposited by gamma rays
as well for a correction of Qgs = 1.504 MeV for the nu-
clear threshold; once it is known that the event is due to
νe + 40Ar, this correction is appropriate.

This capability would lead to multiple beneﬁts. First,
it would improve the precision of the measurements. Sec-
ond, it would allow testing the survival probability over a
wider energy range (including detecting the upturn at low
energies), increasing sensitivity to new physics. Third, it
would increase the robustness of the measurements to
less favorable detector properties than we have assumed.
For example, Fig. A7 shows how Fig. A6 would be al-
tered by an energy resolution of 20% instead of 7% and

sults would be better than we have assumed, though the
νe,µ,τ + e− results would be worse. The latter could be
repaired by improving either energy resolution or shield-
ing or by combining DUNE results on νe + 40Ar with

events (right panel).

C.1 Main Analysis

As shown in the main text, we separate the events
into two categories: inside and outside the forward cone,
which is centered with the direction away from the Sun
and has a half-angle of 40◦. Each category is further di-
vided into day and night events, each having an exposure
of 50 kton-year. The day and night events are further di-
vided into 13 energy bins, with the following extrema:
5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0,
14.0, 20.0 MeV. The night events are also divided into 10
equally spaced cos θz bins with a width of 0.1, where θz is
the zenith angle of the Sun. We checked that variations
in the binning do not signiﬁcantly change our results.

The survival probability of νe for the day events is

ﬁt, i.e. ∆m2
tained using Eq. C1, averaging over the production point
distribution of 8B neutrinos. The latter is calculated us-
ing Eq. C3 and smearing in energy, in order to remove
some residual fast variations. The diﬀerence between the
probabilities increases linearly with energy and it reaches
∼ 15% at 16 MeV. However, most of the detected neutri-
nos have an energy around 10 MeV, for which the diﬀer-
ence is ∼ 7%. The upturn, i.e., the rise of Pee going below
Eν < 5 MeV, is hardly observable in DUNE. In the next

At the location of DUNE, the day and night exposures
diﬀer by a few percent [51], which would have to be taken
into account in an analysis of real data (along with shut-
down periods). In eﬀect, we correct for this by assuming
equal exposures, though we do use the correct location of
DUNE to determine neutrino trajectories through Earth.
Once corrected for, this has a negligible eﬀect on the
statistical uncertainties. Similarly for correcting for the
eccentricity of Earth’s orbit.

Figure A9 shows the calculated asymmetry as a func-
tion of ∆m2
21. We note that AD/N ∝ Eν/∆m2
21, so that
the eﬀect is enhanced at high energies, though its sig-
niﬁcance depends also on the falling statistics. Further,
that symmetric uncertainties on AD/N lead to somewhat
asymmetric uncertainties on ∆m2

21.

Finally, we emphasize that the day-night sensitivity of
DUNE is greater than that of Super-K [6]. Part of the
reason is the increased statistics, due to the much larger
cross section, but the asymmetry itself is also larger. In
DUNE, higher neutrino energies are emphasized, due to
the stronger energy dependence of the cross section, as
well as the larger diﬀerence between neutrino and elec-
tron energy. Also in DUNE, the day-night asymmetry
will be measured through a charged-currrent channel,
avoiding dilution due to the νµ,τ component of the ﬂux.
Last, the tighter relation between neutrino and electron
energy reduces the smearing of the day-night signal be-
tween diﬀerent energy bins.

Appendix D. EFFECTS OF INPUT CHOICES

We report how our results change with diﬀerent as-

sumptions about the inputs.

D.1 Choice of Best-Fit Mixing Parameters

In the main analysis, we generated our simulated data
set assuming the best-ﬁt value of ∆m2
21 from solar ex-
periments, to study the capability of DUNE to resolving
the long-standing tension with KamLAND. If we assume
that there is no new eﬀect in the propagation of solar neu-
trinos, the best ﬁt of DUNE is expected to be the same
as that of KamLAND. We thus also generate a simulated
21 = 7.54 × 10−5 eV2.
data set for ∆m2

Figure A10 shows the allowed regions at 1, 2, 3-σ in
the mixing-parameter plane. The precision on sin2 θ12
is basically unchanged with respect to Fig. 2. However,
now the 3-σ constraint on ∆m2
21 is about three times
larger than what reported in Fig. 2, due to the smaller
day-night asymmetry.

D.2 Assumed Detector Properties

ties on AD/N for the solar (KamLAND) best ﬁt.

paragraph we perform a more precise evaluation of the
day-night eﬀect and its signiﬁcance. A more detailed cal-
culation and discussion can be found in Ref. [37], where
similar results are obtained.

The signiﬁcance of the day-night asymmetry is evalu-
ated separately from the main analysis. In each of the 13
energy bins, we have the expected signal rate (charged-
current events outside the forward cone only) during the
day si
N , and the background rate
(other events outside the forward cone, including elastic-
scattering) during the day and night bi
N . Then, in
each bin, we evaluate the day-night asymmetry

The detection threshold, nominally 5 MeV, depends
on two factors: the ability of the data-acquisition system

background spectrum is steep (see Fig. A5 for details),
this correspondence is sharp. With 40, 30, 20, 10, or
0 cm of shielding, the eﬀective analysis threshold is (cid:39)
5.8, 6.2, 6.5, 6.9, or 7.2 MeV. Even without shielding,
DUNE could make world-leading measurements of solar
neutrinos; to achieve comparable sensitivity to our nom-
inal case, the required exposure would have to increase
by only a factor (cid:39) 2. A low threshold is also preferred to
allow tests of shape distortions in the spectrum and to
enhance particle-identiﬁcation techniques.

A closely related point is energy resolution, because it
smears background spectra from lower to higher energies.
If the energy resolution could be made better than the
expected 7%, it would help the sensitivity somewhat and
might help particle-identiﬁcation techniques more. If the
energy resolution is worse than expected, the sensitiv-
ity will be degraded. In Refs. [31–33], an energy resolu-
tion of (cid:39) 20% is considered if, contrary to expectations,
the electron lifetime in LAr is short and corrections for
this cannot be made. With this resolution and 40 cm
of shielding to reduce neutron backgrounds, sensitivity
compared to that of our nominal case would be obtained
if the exposure were increased by only a factor (cid:39) 2. How-
ever, with this resolution and no shielding, the ability to
measure solar neutrinos would largely be lost. At least
one, and ideally both, of resolution and shielding, must
be prioritized.

An enhanced light-detection system could help in sev-
eral ways, including reﬁning triggering; better determin-
ing the t0 of events, important for energy resolution; and
particle identiﬁcation. This would also beneﬁt supernova
neutrino detection and perhaps other programs.

For angular resolution, though we assumed a smearing
of 25◦, following ICARUS [35], we conservatively deﬁned
the forward cone to have a half-angle of 40◦. Further,
we ﬁnd that the results are not sensitive to reasonable
variations from this.

Calibration of the full detector in the MeV range will
be challenging, but is important to control systemat-
ics. On the experimental side, this will be aided by
the extensive knowledge of techniques built up by earlier
MeV solar and reactor neutrino experiments. Calibration
sources will likely include muon decays at rest, spallation
decays (where the long time between muons, ∼ 20 s in
each module, will allow clean samples), and neutron cap-
tures (where the high energy release, 6.1 MeV, makes the
high-energy edge of the spectrum observable). These will
help calibrate the energy scale, energy resolution, and ab-
solute size of the ﬁducial volume. On the analysis side,
control of systematics will be aided by the use of ratios
(day-night, as well as the comparison of νe + 40Ar and
νe,µ,τ + e− spectra).

D.3 Impact of Cross-Section Uncertainty

to register, recognize, and record signals in the presence
of noise, and the rate of background events in this en-
ergy range. The ﬁrst seems achievable, but remains to
be demonstrated [33]. Regarding backgrounds, we show
in Fig. 3 that even with shielding, neutrons are a sig-
niﬁcant background in the energy range 5–6 MeV. Fig-
ure A11 (left panel) shows that if we increase the analysis
threshold to 6 MeV, the sensitivity barely changes.

To assess the impact of reduced shielding, we ﬁrst con-
sider how the mixing-parameter sensitivity depends on
changes to the analysis threshold for any reason, then
discuss shielding speciﬁcally. Figure A11 (right panel)
shows how much the runtime must be increased to ob-
tain mixing-parameter sensitivity comparable to that of
our nominal case, with a 5-MeV threshold, 40-cm shield-
ing, and an exposure of 100 kton-year (2.5 years of four
modules, or 5 years of two modules). For increases of
up to a few MeV, for which the spectra shown in Fig. 3
fall oﬀ slowly, the increases in required runtime are rea-
sonable. Beyond that, the spectra fall steeply, and the
required runtime increases quickly.

We stress that reasonable changes in the analysis
threshold only aﬀect the sensitivity through statistics,
which can be restored with a longer runtime. This is be-
cause sin2 θ12 is determined from the electron-neutrino
survival probability, which is near-constant at these ener-
gies, and because ∆m2
21 is determined from the day-night
asymmetry, which increases with energy.

Reductions in the assumed shielding would increase
the required analysis threshold. Because the neutron

In our main analysis, we neglected the uncertainty on
the charged-current cross section. Here we estimate the

eﬀects of a nonzero uncertainty by assuming a normaliza-
tion uncertainty of 1% or 10%. In a future work, we will
consider the eﬀects of uncertainties on individual transi-
tion strengths. Figure A12 shows the allowed ranges of
the mixing parameters in these cases. For a cross-section

uncertainty of 1%, the eﬀects are moderate, indicating
that reaching this scale would be adequate. For a cross-
section uncertainty of 10%, the uncertainty on sin2 θ12 is
worsened signiﬁcantly, while that of ∆m2
21 is unchanged.

depends on the product of φ(8B), the cross section, and
sin2 θ12, so they are degenerate. The elastic-scattering
event spectrum depends on φ(8B), a known cross sec-
tion, and a diﬀerent weighting of sin2 θ12, so it can only
be used to solve for two of the three parameters. In the
day-night asymmetry, all three factors cancel.

If the results of other detectors are included, then the
eﬀects of cross-section uncertainties are much less. (All
results above are based on results from DUNE alone, with
no priors on the parameters.) The reason is that these
data help break the degeneracy in the normalization of
the spectrum. Figure A13 repeats Fig. A12 but takes into
account 4% Gaussian priors on φ(8B) and sin2 θ12 from
solar data, and not taking advantage of their correlations.
A joint ﬁt with other data would be even more powerful.

D.4 Impact of Other Systematic Uncertainties

In our main analysis, we neglected systematic uncer-
tainties. Here we make estimates of their eﬀects on our
results, neglecting cross-section uncertainties, as those on
the charged-current cross section are considered above
and those on the neutrino-electron scattering cross sec-
tion are tiny. All other inputs are as in our main analysis.
To introduce a scale for expectations, the systematic un-
certainties in Super-K and SNO are at or below a few
percent [5, 6, 40].

The most important energy correlated systematic un-
certainties are typically those on the energy scale (e.g.,
nonlinearities) and energy resolution parameters. Addi-
tionally, one needs to consider the uncertainty on the
shape of the 8B energy spectrum. The most impor-
tant energy uncorrelated systematic uncertainties, i.e.,
those acting independently on each energy bin, are typ-
ically uncertainties on eﬃciencies, cuts, and background
spectrum shape. The main systematic uncertainties for
DUNE are unknown, so we simply set a scale and repeat
our analysis. When we set a scale of X%, we mean this
for each of the energy scale, the energy resolution, and
the energy uncorrelated systematic uncertainties. This
is conservative compared to what has been achieved in
Super-K and SNO. We take the systematic uncertainty
on the 8B spectrum shape from Ref. [57].

Figure A14 shows how the allowed regions change with
systematic uncertainties of 2% and 4%. The eﬀects
are comparable to those due to an uncertainty on the
charged-current cross section. The precision on sin2 θ12
is weakened, because it depends on the spectrum nor-
malization. On the other hand, the precision on ∆m2
21
is much less aﬀected, because it mostly derives from the
day-night eﬀect, for which the systematics cancel almost
completely in the ratio.

As above for the cross-section uncertainties, the eﬀects
of the systematic uncertainties are signiﬁcantly mitigated
if we include solar priors (not shown). Because of this,
and because we conservatively took all types of system-
atics at the same scale, the true results would be better.
