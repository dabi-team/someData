Abstract We present the results obtained from the analysis of dynamic ﬁbrils in NOAA
active region (AR) 12132, using high resolution Hα observations from New Solar
Telescope operating at BBSO. The dynamic ﬁbrils are seen to be moving up and down,
and most of these dynamic ﬁbrils are periodic and have jet like appearance. We found
from our observations that the ﬁbrils follows perfect parabolic paths at the most in many
cases. A statistical measure on the properties of the parabolic paths showing an analysis
on deceleration, maximum velocity, duration and kinetic energy of these ﬁbrils is pre-
sented here. We found the average maximum velocity to be around 15 km s−1 and mean
deceleration to be around 100 m s−2. The deceleration observed appears to be a fraction
of gravity of sun and is not compatible with the path of ballistic at the gravity of sun. We
found positive correlation between the deceleration and the maximum velocity. This cor-
relation is consistent with the simulations done earlier on magnetoacoustic shock waves
propagating upward.

Key words: Sun: sunspots-oscillation — Sun: magnetic ﬁelds — Sun: chromosphere

1 INTRODUCTION

The chromosphere that lies between the photosphere and the hot corona is often reveals jet like features,
which are small in size and has very short lifetimes. Though there have been a lot of confusions with
the relationship between the quiet sun limb spicules, mottles observed on the quiet sundisk and the dy-
namic ﬁbrils (DFs)(Grossmann-Doerth & Schmidt 1992), the three phenomena are related (Tsiropoula
et al. 1994). The physical process of chromosphere is not well understood, especially the mass and en-
ergy transportation in dynamic ﬁbrils. (see Rutten 2012).The ﬂows (up and down) from photosphere
to chromosphere and the higher layer corona ﬂaunt a variety of oscillation modes like three- minute,
ﬁve-minute and the seven-minute oscillations. Tian et al. (2014) presented strong evidence to the shock
behavior of sunspot oscillations for the ﬁrst time in sunspots in the transition region (TR) and in the
chromosphere based on the IRIS observations. The 5-minute oscillations (Leighton et al. 1962) happen-
ing over the sunspots have been studied extensively over a period of time and have been found that there
is a decrease in amplitude with height and not easily detected in the higher layers above photosphere.
The 3-minute oscillations could be due to the mode conversion of magnetoacoustic waves (Stangalini
et al. 2012). The ﬁbrilar structure of chromosphere reveals that magnetic ﬁelds play a signiﬁcant role

(Hale 1908). The jet like features which are also known as spicules, mottles, and the DFs are observed
at limb, quiet sun disk and in AR respectively.
Our main concentration is on the observations of DFs. The dynamics of DFs and its imprint on TR,
and its oscillations are extensively studied (de Pontieu et al. 1999; De Pontieu et al. 2003a,b, 2004). A
remarkable power of oscillations in the Dfs were determined by De Pontieu et al. (2003a). This was dis-
covered using high resolution data from SST. De Pontieu et al. (2004) and de Pontieu & Erd´elyi (2006)
build up a model which explains the reason for DFs to be the inclination of magnetic ﬁeld lines. This
inclination reduce acoustic cut off frequency permitting the longer period so called, p-mode waves, to
leak into the atmosphere where it forms shock and these shocks are the reason for driving the DFs. This
was further investigated and proved by Hansteen et al. (2006) using the similar data from SST that the
DFs are caused by magnetoacoustic shock waves. In this paper we performed an analysis on the motion
of DFs using New Solar Telescope (NST, Cao et al. 2010) (now known as GST, Goode Solar Telecope,
after July 2017 ) operating at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) by measuring its properties and de-
scribed its temporal evolution. Our results supports the fact that the DFs are formed due to the shock
waves in chromosphere that are driven by the ﬂows that were convective and photospheric oscillations as
reported by De Pontieu et al. (2004). Through analysis of dataset taken at NST, we ﬁnd that the DFs and
its properties could be a result of shock waves that are generated from the p-mode propagating upward.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA PROCESSING

The sunspot of NOAA AR 12132, located at S09E08 on 2014 August 5 from BBSO (NST, Cao et al.
2010), was chosen for studying the DFs (see Figure 1). The pointer was (270(cid:48)(cid:48), 395(cid:48)(cid:48)), targeting the
sunspot of AR 12132. The observations were performed using NST during 18:20 UT−19:20 UT. The
Chromospheric images were acquired every 23 s by scanning of the Hα spectral line from the blue wing
-1 ˚A to red wing +1 ˚A with a step of size 0.2 ˚A. The FOV is about 70(cid:48)(cid:48), and has a pixel scale of 0.029(cid:48)(cid:48)
pixel−1. The data is used to investigate the umbral oscillations in chromospheric sunspot at different
solar altitudes observed on August 5. A combination of a 5 ˚A interference ﬁlter and a FabryProt etalon
is used in the VIS to get a bandpass of 0.07 ˚A at the Hα line. We chose the ﬁrst Hα -1.0 ˚A image as a
reference image to align all other images in this passband. The relative shifts were recorded, and used
to register the images in the other passbands of Hα.

3 DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

A close look into the movie of Hα line core images gives an insight into ﬁbrils located in the close
proximity and in the vicinity of sunspot near the image center, a few of which were colligated with
the superpenumbra. We investigate upon 40 such DFs for this study, wherein most AR DFs from the
line core of Hα images ensues almost a perfect parabolic paths. We opt for chosing the direction of
a DF, or a bunch of DFs, manually using CRisp SPectral EXplorer, Vissers & Rouppe van der Voort
(CRISPEX, 2012) which helps in analyzing the multidimensional data cubes and an additional software
called TANAT (Timeslice ANAlysis tools) for anlayzing and also for various measurements of data. A
comprehensive use of this software not only made the seeking of sequence of images easier but also
helped in tracking the events that were very clear while ascending and descending along their individual
paths in 584 jet like features in Hα. The CRISPEX is a widget based versatile IDL tool for visual
inspection and analysis of high resolution data. CRISPEX also provides space-time diagram for all
the linear as well as curved paths. This information could be stored and could be retrieved later for
further analysis. We have produced the space-time diagram for all the 40 DFs detected. The space-time
diagram for one of the DF is shown in Figure 2 and its evolution is shown in Figure 3. The ﬁgure shows
the receding of the already risen DF along the same path. We have detected almost 584 such trajectories
and did a parabolic ﬁtting on it. Figure 4 gives an example of the ﬁtting. From the ﬁt, we calculated
the parameters like deceleration, maximum velocity, maximum height, duration and kinetic energy as
well. We assume the electron density to be same throughout the chromosphere. This electron density
(ne) multiplied with the mass of the electron (me) gives density (ρ = ne me ) which means that the

kinetic energy per unit volume would be equal to the square of the maximum velocity (KE = v2
max/2).
The kinetic energy per unit volume of these jet like features may transform further into heat and might
play a signiﬁcant role in the heating of corona.

Fig. 7 The fourier power spectra at the positions marked in white dotted lines in Figure 2.

We obtained the maximum velocity is between 10 km s−1 and 30 km s−1 and deceleration between
50 m s−2 and 200 m s−2. We noticed that these correlations are quite similar to the measurements
on dynamic ﬁbrils done by Hansteen et al. (2006). But we found that the correlation between the
duration and the deceleration/maximum velocity is comparatively weaker, showing a high scatter and
nonlinearity in almost all the DFs. It could be seen in (De Pontieu et al. 2007) that the correlation
between the duration and the deceleration/ maximum velocity is not so clear or in other words weak.
Similar results have been obtained by Langangen et al. (2008a) in DFs with the reason being the effect
of projection. It could be probable that there is no effect of projection seen in duration whereas the
effect is more prominent in velocity and deceleration. It is very clear from scatter plot in Figure 5 that
the correlation between duration and deceleration/ maximum velocity is ambiguous with huge scatter
and difference in slopes. By tracing all the jet like features we obtain the histograms of max velocity,
duration, deceleration, and the kinetic energy shown in Figure 6. From the histograms, it is detected
that the maximum velocity, duration and decelerations follows a Gaussian distribution. The maximum

line at different points along the DF as it propagates upward is shown in (a), (b) and (c)

velocities are within 10 km s−1 to 30 km s−1 and the average is about 15 km s−1, the duration ranges
from 2 min to 20 min and the average is about 11 min, the deceleration ranges from 10 m s−2 to 200 m
s−2 and the average is around 100 m s−2. We obtain the average maximum height to be around 0.025
Mm. We ﬁnd the kinetic energy of all the 584 jet like features and estimated its average to be about 220
gm cm −1s−2 and found it to follow a partial Gaussian distribution.
We take the fourier power spectra along the DF (originates from the umbral boundary and propagates
higher up into the superpenumbral region) at three different points along the DF as shown in Figure
7. The power spectra in Figure 7(a) is at the umbral boundary, (b) is at penumbral region and (c) is
at superpenumbral region. The running waves travels through the boundary of umbra and penumbra
and eventually disappears at the penumbral boundary. In the power spectra we see oscillations in
DF varying with time. To measure the oscillation period, we use the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
function using IDL. As shown in Figure 7, the frequency at the umbral boundary is ≈ 4.3 mHz and
based on the frequency of the power spectra, the oscillation periods at the same point is 235 s. The
results show that the oscillations within umbra are a typical 3-min oscillation with period T = 235
s, and the oscillations of the same within penumbra are a typical 5-min oscillation with period T
= 345 s and T=408 s. The period of umbra oscillations is almost one half of that of the penumbral
oscillations. The corresponding periods of umbral and penumbral oscillations measured by using FFT
function are T umbra = 235 s and T penumbra = 408 s respectively. These oscillations propagates
higher up and further develops into shocks as shown in Figure 8 suggesting oscillations are upward
propagating shock waves. Each panel in Figure 8 corresponds to three different positions along the
marked DF in Figure It is quite possible that the dynamic ﬁbrils are usually driven in union with

Dynamic ﬁbrils

the sunspot oscillations (Chae et al. 2014). The Oscillations propagates higher up and develops into
shock which propels the ﬁbrils quite a several times. Thus, we speculate that the shocks driven DFs
are related to the sunspot oscillations. To be more precise, there exists a form of propagation of shock
wave fronts that starts from the sunspot center and reaches the bottom of the ﬁbrils and propagates
higher up along the DF (Chae et al. 2014). Hence, it is clear that the DFs are physically related to
the sunspot oscillations and the form of shock fronts propagates from the sunspot center. Figure 8
shows the temporal-spectral variations (t-λ plots) indicating the oscillations at three different positions
along the DF (connecting the sunspot to the ﬁbril ) to infact be the upward propagating shock waves.
Hansteen et al. (2006) and De Pontieu et al. (2007) simulated upward propagating magnetoacoustic
shock waves and created the dynamic ﬁbrils observational behaviour. They found that the highly
dynamic chromospheric shock waves cause signiﬁcant upward and downward motion of the upper
chromosphere. The transition of an upward propagating shock through the chromosphere produces a
form of sawtooth or N-shape (as seen in Figure 8 ), which marks an impression of blueshift followed by
a gradual drift towards the redshift and then a sudden appearance of a blueshift (Hansteen et al. 2006;
Vecchio et al. 2009). The N-shape pattern preponderate in all the three t-λ plots constructed at different
locations along the DF and hence conﬁrms the idea of shock driven ﬁbrils. The correlation coefﬁcient
between the maximum velocity and deceleration of a sample of 40 sunspot dynamic ﬁbrils is 0.757.
This proves that the oscillations in sunspots are the magnetoacoustic shock waves that propagates
upward (e.g.,Lites 1986; Centeno et al. 2006; Chae et al. 2014; Tian et al. 2014; Yurchyshyn et al. 2014).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The above found correlations could probably be a signiﬁcant signature for the jets that are periodic,
are perhaps driven by the waves that normally propagates from photosphere into the chromosphere and
hence steepen into shocks Rouppe van der Voort & de la Cruz Rodr´ıguez (2013). The maximum veloc-
ities of these jet like features that we have found in our data are usually between 10−30 km s−1 and
is found to be similar in comparison to Hansteen et al. (2006); De Pontieu et al. (2007). The chromo-
spheric waves are usually created by the usual convective ﬂows and also due to the oscillations found
in photosphere and also in the convection zone. These disturbances further propagates into the chro-
mosphere upwards and thereby shock and becomes a driving force for the plasma in chromospheric
region and hence results in the formation of the DFs. The periods that are longer than the period of
local acoustic cut off is blocked by the chromosphere. This cut off period is completely dependent on
the magnetic ﬁled line inclination with respect to the vertical (Suematsu 1990; De Pontieu et al. 2004).
A single shock could possibly drive the DFs and is also the reason to understand the correlation be-
tween the deceleration and the maximum velocity. These DFs are the direct consequence of the upward
propagating chromospheric oscillations/waves that are produced in the convection zone or photosphere
as a result of global p-mode oscillations and also the convective ﬂows. The waves propagates into the
chromosphere and passes through upto the region where Hα is formed, thus forming shocks thereby
while its upward propagation. The fact on which we stress our interpretation is that the DFs follow a
parabolic path with a good positive correlation between the properties like the velocity and the deceler-
ation for all of the detected DFs. We found that velocity and deceleration are directly proportional with
higher the velocity, the higher is the deceleration. The velocity that Suematsu et al. (1995) reports for
their event of mottles is in the range of 10−30 km s−1 and we found it to be rather similar to what we
found in our BBSO/NST observations for our event of DFs. The same has been seen by Hansteen et al.
(2006) and is evident that the formation of DFs is due to the shocks in the chromosphere driven by the
photospheric convective ﬂows and oscillations as well. Hence, we conclude that the driving mechanism
is same. Heggland et al. (2007), Heggland et al. (2011) simulation also explains that the usually long
period waves propagates into the solar atmosphere along the magnetic ﬁeld lines that are inclined. The
most essential conclusion is with the explanation that the driving force for the DFs are the so called mag-
netoacoustic shocks that are induced by the p-mode oscillations and in addition leakage of convective
ﬂows into the chromosphere. Both the observations Lites 1992 and simulations Bard & Carlsson 2010

provides enough evidence for the waves that propagates upwards and also the shocks in the atmosphere
of the sunspots. This phenomena appears as a dark feature in the Hα images and are due to the density
of magnetic ﬂux. De Pontieu et al. (2004) proposed that the similarity between the observations and
some modeling done earlier on the DFs provides reason for the upward and downward movement of the
upper chromosphere which is due to the shock waves in the chromosphere. Zhang et al. (2017) proves
that the oscillations which appears to be like surge or light walls which lies above the light bridges are
also caused by shocks . Our ﬁndings indicates that, in ARs, most of these jet like features are caused by
the shocks in chromosphere.
