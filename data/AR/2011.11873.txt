Non-Neutralized Electric Current of Active Regions
Explained as a Projection Eﬀect

Abstract
Active regions (ARs) often possess an observed net electric current in a single
magnetic polarity. We show that such “non-neutralized” currents can arise from a
geometric projection eﬀect when a twisted ﬂux tube obliquely intersects the pho-
tosphere. To this end, we emulate surface maps of an emerging AR by sampling
horizontal slices of a semi-torus ﬂux tube at various heights. Although the tube
has no net toroidal current, its poloidal current, when projected along the vertical
direction, amounts to a signiﬁcant non-neutralized component on the surface.
If the tube emerges only partially as in realistic settings, the non-neutralized
current will 1) develop as double ribbons near the sheared polarity inversion
line, (2) positively correlate with the twist, and 3) reach its maximum before
the magnetic ﬂux. The projection eﬀect may be important to the photospheric
current distribution, in particular during the early stages of ﬂux emergence.

1. Introduction

1.1. Deﬁnitions of Current Neutralization

Magnetic ﬁeld in the solar interior is believed to exist in a “ﬁbril” state: isolated
ﬂux tubes generated from dynamo actions are embedded in a relatively ﬁeld-
free background (Fan, 2009). Strong ﬁeld strength and twist keep the tubes

coherent against vigorous convection (Sch¨ussler, 1979). This places an interesting
constraint on the net electric current I. Using Amp`ere’s law and Stokes theorem,
we have

where j is the electric current density, B is the magnetic ﬁeld, A is an area on
the tube cross section, ˆn is its unit normal vector, C is any surface with area
A = (cid:82)
C dA, ∂C is the perimeter of C, and l is its tangent vector. For simplicity,
we assume unity magnetic permeability. Suppose a magnetic ﬂux tube is compact
in space. More speciﬁcally, there is a closed loop ∂C such that B = 0 all along the
loop. This shows that a compact ﬂux tube has I = 0, i.e. it is current-neutralized.
The argument implies neutralized electric currents in the axial direction. For
a tube with coherent twist, j near the tube center will point in one direction
when projected onto the axis. Conversely, j in the tube periphery must point in
the opposite direction, forming a sheath or a skin layer. The former is termed the
“direct current” (DC), and the latter the “return current” (RC; e.g., Melrose,
1995). The ﬂux tube is “current neutralized” when DC and RC add to zero.

Solar active regions (ARs), formed through emergence of subsurface ﬂux
tubes, are known to harbor electric currents in the corona. In many cases, their
sheared or sigmoidal loops are incompatible with a current-free, potential ﬁeld
morphology. Moreover, they must contain suﬃcient free energy to power ﬂares
and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This picture is quite diﬀerent from the
convection zone. Here, the magnetic ﬁeld is volume-ﬁlling and dominates the
plasma dynamics.

In the thin layer of the photosphere, the plasma density and pressure decrease
rapidly with height; the magnetic ﬁeld begins to transition from a ﬁbril to a
volume-ﬁlling state. Maps of the photospheric B, magnetograms, are routinely
inferred from spectropolarimetric observations. Assuming a local Cartesian ge-
ometry and the photosphere as a thin boundary at z = 0, the vertical current
density jz and the net current Iz can be estimated from the horizontal ﬁeld
component Bh, similar to Equation (1):

where C is now a ﬁnite area lying entirely on z = 0.

For an isolated, spatially compact sunspot, there exists a closed loop ∂C
lying on z = 0 that surrounds the sunspot such that B(z = 0) = 0. This
implies Iz = 0. That is, all currents that enter the photosphere must return
to the convection zone, i.e., they are “balanced”. In practice, however, this is

SOLA: neutral.tex; 4 December 2020; 1:38; p. 2

Current Neutralization

not how net currents are measured for observed ARs. First of all, sunspots are
rarely completely isolated. Furthermore, eruptive ARs tend to harbor sunspots
of opposite polarities in close proximity. To measure the net current, standard
practice is to take C as the contiguous area of a magnetic polarity partially
bounded by the polarity inversion line (PIL; i.e. Bz = 0). Figure 1(a) of T¨or¨ok
et al. (2014) shows a good example. DC and RC are expected to reside in the
core region and the periphery, respectively.

1.2. Non-Neutralized Currents in ARs

Ground-based vector magnetograms provided early evidence for non-neutralized
currents in the AR photosphere. Leka et al. (1996) followed the evolution of
an emerging AR over several days. A signiﬁcant net current appears in each
magnetic polarity, whose increase cannot be explained by the shearing ﬂows in
the photosphere alone and must be carried by the emerging ﬂux. Wheatland
(2000) analyzed a sample of 21 ARs. In most cases, the net current for the
entire AR is consistent with zero. Within each magnetic polarity, however, it is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero.

Using high-resolution vector magnetograms from the Spectropolarimeter (SP)
on board the Hinode satellite, Ravindra et al. (2011) and Georgoulis, Titov, and
Miki´c (2012) found that the non-neutralized currents are always accompanied by
well-formed, sheared PILs. Meanwhile, Venkatakrishnan and Tiwari (2009) and
Gosain, D´emoulin, and L´opez Fuentes (2014) found isolated sunspots without a
sheared PIL to be well neutralized. This is a natural consequence of Equation (2):
the sheared component of Bh along the PIL should contribute signiﬁcantly to
the line integral around a single magnetic polarity.

The current distribution has perceived important implications for solar erup-
tions. Many CME models employ DC-dominated ﬂux ropes as the driver (e.g.,
Titov and D´emoulin, 1999). The inclusion of RC will reduce the outward mag-
netic “hoop force” that drives the eruption (Forbes, 2010). Observationally,
non-neutralized currents indeed correlate with eruptive activities. Liu et al.
(2017), Vemareddy (2019), and Avallone and Sun (2020) compared ARs with and
without major eruptions using data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The quiescent ARs are
mostly current-neutralized, while the active ones are not. Falconer (2001) and
Kontogiannis et al. (2019) demonstrated the net current as a useful index for
space weather predictions. On a related note, electric currents can also cause an
apparent line-of-sight ﬂux imbalance because of the directionality of the magnetic
ﬁeld they produce (Gary and Rabin, 1995).

The origin of the non-neutralized current in ARs is not entirely clear. If
ﬂux emergence is responsible, it must explain how it can arise from a current-
neutralized subsurface ﬂux tube. Longcope and Welsch (2000) proposed an

SOLA: neutral.tex; 4 December 2020; 1:38; p. 3

Sun & Cheung

analytical model where only a fraction of the current passes into the corona.
The rest, including most of the weaker RC, is shunted to the surface layers
and hidden from the observer. T¨or¨ok et al. (2014) demonstrated a similar eﬀect
using a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation from Leake, Linton, and T¨or¨ok
(2013). As a subsurface, neutralized ﬂux tube emerges, non-neutralized current
develops simultaneously with the ﬂux emergence and PIL shear. The degree of
non-neutralization becomes more pronounced in higher layers as RC remains
trapped in lower ones.

Shear and vortex surface ﬂows are often used to induce coronal electric cur-
rents in MHD models. T¨or¨ok and Kliem (2003) and Dalmasse et al. (2015)
showed that diﬀerent photospheric line-tied motions can generate diﬀerent de-
grees of current neutralization. Only motions that directly shear the PIL will
generate a non-neutralized component. Simulations by Fan (2001) and Manch-
ester et al. (2004) showed that the shear ﬂows on the PIL are driven by the
magnetic tension force during ﬂux emergence, which comes from the twisted
tube itself as it expands in the corona.

1.3. Outline

Here we explore an alternative origin of the observed, non-neutralized electric
current in emerging ARs. Using an analytical ﬂux tube model, we show that a
neutralized subsurface ﬂux tube can lead to a signiﬁcant non-neutralized vertical
current on the surface due to a geometric projection eﬀect.

We described two versions current neutralization in Section 1.1: one in the
context of the subsurface ﬂux tube itself, and the other in the context of the
photospheric observation. As we shall see, they refer to diﬀerent components of
the current system when the tube axis obliquely intersects the surface. Such a
distinction is seldom discussed in the literature, but is central to this work.

Below, we describe the ﬂux tube model in Section 2, present our results in
Section 3, and discuss the implications in Section 4. Additional details of the
ﬂux tube model are available in the appendix.

2. Flux Tube Model

2.1. Model Setup

We consider a twisted, semi-torus ﬂux tube model from Fan and Gibson (2003,
hereafter FG03). In a global Cartesian coordinate with unit vectors ( ˆx, ˆy, ˆz), the
subsurface tube is centered at r0 = (0, 0, h), where h < 0 (Figure 1).

The semi-torus tube axis has a radius of R; it is axisymmetric with a polar
axis parallel to ˆy. In a local spherical coordinate centered at r0 with unit vector

Figure 1. Magnetic ﬁeld of a partially emerged FG03 ﬂux tube (R = 0.5, a = 0.12, q = 0.8,
h = −0.5). The tube axis (dark gray curve) just starts to touch the photosphere at z = 0.
Maps on two horizontal slices at z = −0.5 and 0 show Bz distribution. Selective ﬁeld lines
are traced from a distance of w = 0.08 (yellow) and 0.18 (green) from the tube axis in the
x = 0 plane. They are located within the DC core and RC sheath, respectively. The black and
red arrows show the radial vector for an arbitrary point in the spherical and torus coordinate
system, respectively (see appendix). The inset illustrates the spherical coordinate (r, θ, φ), and
the torus coordinate (w, ψ, φ). The poloidal angle ψ here is negative.

Here, r is the radial distance from the origin; θ is the polar angle from the polar
axis; φ is the azimuth angle where 0 is along +z and increases clockwise toward
+x (−π/2 ≤ θ, φ ≤ π/2). Moreover, w is the distance from the tube axis. Bt, q,
and a are constants: Bt is the characteristic ﬁeld strength; q is a measure of the
twist; a is the characteristic length scale for the tube radius. Field lines near the
tube axis wind about the axis at a rate of q/a per unit length. We truncate B
to 0 outside the surface w = 3a. The tube is thus isolated with a circular cross
section and a radius of 3a. Detailed expressions of B and j in various coordinate
systems are available in the appendix.

In this work, we consider the following default parameters: Bt = 1.0, R = 0.5,
and a = 0.12. Additionally, we limit ourselves to the cases where q > 0, such
that the ﬂux tube has a right-handed twist.

To emulate ﬂux emergence, we displace the ﬂux tube upward by increasing
h toward zero, and evaluate B and j on the horizontal slices z = 0. This is
equivalent to sampling the variables at diﬀerent heights if the ﬂux tube is ﬁxed
in space. The process is demarcated by several key values of h:

• The emergence starts at h = −(R + 3a) = −0.86.
• The axis of the tube reaches the surface at h = −R = −0.5.
• The crest of the tube detaches from the surface at h = −(R − 3a) = −0.14.
• The emergence ends at h = 0.

In FG03, the tube ﬁeld at z = 0 was used to prescribe a time-dependent
boundary condition that drives the coronal dynamics. Here, we focus solely on
the layer z = 0 as a proxy of the photospheric observations, ignoring any coronal
evolution or its feedback. This approach has been used to help interpret the
emerging non-potential ﬁeld structure observed in the photosphere with success
(Lites et al., 1995; Gibson et al., 2004; Luoni et al., 2011).

2.2. Poloidal-Toroidal Decomposition

The axial direction of a torus is known as the toroidal direction, which is just ˆφ
in our spherical coordinate. The non-axial direction, on the other hand, includes
both ˆr and ˆθ. We may deﬁne a torus coordinate where a non-axial vector can be
decomposed into radial and poloidal components (see Figure 1 and appendix).
In a constant φ plane, the former directs away from the tube axis, while the
latter follows a circle around the tube axis.

We show in the appendix that the non-axial B and j in the FG03 ﬂux tube
are purely poloidal. Using the subscript P (T) to denote the poloidal (toroidal)
components, we have in spherical coordinate

BP = Br ˆr + Bθ

BT = Bφ

jP = jr ˆr + jθ

Their respective contributions to the surface observation vary at diﬀerent stages
of the ﬂux emergence, when the tube axis intersects the surface at diﬀerent an-
gles. In particular, the projected values in the vertical direction can be evaluated
by taking the dot product with ˆz, e.g., BP · ˆz.

2.3. Two Versions of Current Neutralization

Considering the ﬂux tube by itself, we deﬁne DC and RC as components of the
net toroidal current. For q > 0, DC (RC) refers to the net current for jφ > 0
(jφ < 0). We denote the total DC as I D
T , and the net toroidal
current IT. We can evaluate them by integrating jφ on a cross section φ = 0:

For a photospheric vector magnetogram, we denote the total DC in a single
z , and the net vertical current Iz. For

magnetic polarity as I D
q > 0, we can evaluate them by integrating jz on z = 0 where Bz > 0:

We can separately evaluate the projected poloidal and toroidal contribution by
integrating jP · ˆz and jT · ˆz instead of jz.

The degree of current neutralization are often quantiﬁed by the relative mag-

nitude of DC versus RC. In this study, we use the index

for the toroidal current and

We will show that a geometric projection eﬀect is capable of producing large Iz
and Rz from a ﬂux tube with small IT and unity RT.

3. Result

3.1. Flux Tube Cross Section

For our ﬁducial case with q = 0.8, the toroidal current density on the tube
cross section features a compact DC core and a diﬀuse RC sheath (Figure 2(a)).

the tube axis. The background color shows the toroidal current density jT; the arrows show
poloidal current density vectors jP. The tube axis is marked with a cross. The coordinate
(∆y, ∆z) indicates the oﬀset from the tube axis in y and z direction. (b) Net toroidal current
IT within a tube radius w, normalized by I D

T of the entire tube.

Though not strictly axisymmetric because of the bending of the ﬂux tube axis,
the sign change occurs near the radius w ≈ a = 0.12 (Equation (16)). The net
toroidal current integrated within a circle of radius w peaks at w = 0.12 due to
the contribution from the DC core. It becomes quite neutralized once the RC
sheath is included (Figure 2(b)). For the entire tube w = 3a = 0.36, there is
IT = 0.004I D
T and RT = 1.004. Strictly speaking, an additional RC skin layer
with a net current of −0.004I D
T is required. We ignore this layer as it does not
aﬀect any of our conclusions. Because I D
T both linearly scale with q, RT
is independent of the twist.

T and I R

In contrast, the poloidal current density has a single sign, rotating counter-
clockwise around the axis in the same direction as the poloidal ﬁeld (Equa-
tion (21); Figure 2(a)). Its magnitude is independent of q by construct, and is
comparable to the toroidal current density for q = 0.8.

3.2. Synthetic Surface Observations

The vertical magnetic ﬁeld Bz shows two elongated polarities when the crest of
the tube intersects the surface (Figure 3(a)). These are known observationally
as “magnetic tongues”, which are a manifestation of the magnetic twist (L´opez
Fuentes et al., 2000). As h increases, the tongues retract and transition into two
circles, which correspond to the two legs of the ﬂux tube (Figure 3(b)-(c)). The
poloidal and toroidal contributions to the vertical ﬁeld are more important in
the early and late stages, respectively (Figure 3(d)-(i)).

The vertical current density jz shows two elongated, ribbon-shaped polarities
early on (Figure 4(a)). They mainly arise from the projected poloidal component
(Figure 4(d)). For q = 0.8, jz is mostly positive in the positive magnetic polarity,

so DC dominates. As the tube continues to rise, the RC sheath becomes visible
on the surface, and the jz distribution starts to resemble jφ on the tube cross
section (Figure 4(g)-(i)).

regions where Bz > 0. Arrows show Bh on the PIL.

For q = 0.8, the surface vertical current is highly non-neutralized when the
axis just starts to emerge (h = −R). Iz and Rz peak at h = −0.44 and −0.50,
with a maximum of Iz = 2.6I D
T and Rz = 8.8, respectively (Figure 5(a)-(b)).
The dominance of DC is clearly owing to the poloidal contribution (Figure 5(c)).
At h = −0.5, the contribution of the poloidal component in Iz is about 18 times
that of the toroidal counterpart.

To evaluate the general properties of the model, we consider two additional

cases for q = 0.2 and 0.5. Several notable features are as follows.

Patterns in surface map.— For h = −0.5, the jz and Bz polarities become
better aligned as q increases (Figure 6). This is an interesting feature of the
FG03 ﬂux tube, where jP and BP depend diﬀerently on q. The predominant
poloidal current contribution jP · ˆz is independent of q (Equation (23)), whereas
the toroidal contribution jT · ˆz merely appends a curved tail to the jz ribbon,
creating a “Yin-Yang” pattern. Therefore, the jz patterns remain almost un-

changed with q. Contrarily, the poloidal ﬁeld contribution BP · ˆz linearly scales
with q (Equation (22)). As q increases, the Bz magnetic tongues rotate clockwise
to better match the current ribbons. The PIL becomes largely parallel to the jz
ribbons for q = 0.8; the horizontal ﬁeld Bh is also more sheared. As h increases
further, U-shaped ﬁeld lines in the lower portion of the tube will graze the surface
to create “bald patches”, where Bh on the PIL directs from the negative to the
positive side (Titov, Priest, and Demoulin, 1993).

Non-neutralized current vs. twist.— The maximum Iz and Rz both positively
correlate with q (Figure 5(a)-(b)). This is because the Bz and jz polarities
become better aligned at higher q: the area occupied by DC increases. The
Rz values appear unexpectedly low for q = 0.8 early on (h < −0.8). We ﬁnd
that the toroidal contribution in Iz is initially negative (Figure 5(c)). This RC
component is larger for q = 0.8, leading to an overall smaller Rz. It is soon oﬀset
by the faster increasing DC component in the poloidal current.

Evolution of current and magnetic ﬂux.— As h increases, Iz and Rz initially
increase along with the surface magnetic ﬂux Φ (Figure 5(d)). The former peak
at h ≈ −R, when a signiﬁcant portion of the toroidal magnetic ﬂux is still below
the surface. As emergence proceeds, Iz and Rz will decrease due to the toroidal
contribution, whereas Φ will continue to increase. For an untwisted ﬂux tube,
the maximum Φ is expected to occur at h = −(R − 3a) = −0.14, when the
crest of the tube fully emerges. Such is also the case for both q = 0.2 and 0.5.
For q = 0.8, however, Φ peaks signiﬁcant earlier at h = −0.37 with a maximum
5% higher than the total toroidal ﬂux. This is owing to the strong poloidal ﬁeld
contribution (Equation (22)). A portion of highly twisted magnetic ﬁeld lines
will intersect the z = 0 plane more than two times (appendix).

We conclude that the observed, non-neutralized vertical current (large Iz
and Rz) can arise from a neutralized ﬂux tube (zero IT and unity RT) due to
the projected poloidal component. The conclusion holds for the early stages of
emergence only, when the crest of the tube is partially emerged, and the axis
obliquely intersects the surface. For the later stages, the tube axis becomes more
perpendicular to the surface. The observed current becomes more neutralized as
the toroidal component takes over.

4. Discussion

For an idealized, torus-shaped ﬂux tubes, as long as BT decreases away from
the tube axis, the surface jP · ˆz distribution is expected to be bipolar like FG03.
Whether the surface current is neutralized will depend on the patterns of BP · ˆz,
which is sensitive to the global magnetic twist (Figure 6). Other conditions being
equal, a ﬂux tube with higher twist should possess higher magnetic helicity and
free energy, which are known to drive solar eruptions. This, combined with the

SOLA: neutral.tex; 4 December 2020; 1:38; p. 11

Sun & Cheung

positive correlation between Rz and q, provides a natural explanation to the
increased eruptivity in ARs with signiﬁcant non-neutralized currents.

We temper our conclusion with some caveats. MHD simulations have shown
that it is diﬃcult for a twisted ﬂux tube to rise bodily into the corona (e.g.,
Fan, 2001; Archontis and Hood, 2010). The concave portions of the ﬁeld lines
are loaded with dense plasma, which prevents the tube axis from rising for more
than a few scale heights above the surface. Indeed, the tongue-shaped Bz and jz
polarities (Figures 3(a)) frequently appear in observations (e.g., Poisson et al.,
2016) without developing further into two circular polarities. If so, the h ≤ −R
phase in our model should be more relevant than h > −R in realistic settings.
In these early stages of ﬂux emergence, the poloidal component is expected to
play a prominent role. We note that counterexamples also exist where the axial
ﬂux fully emerges in simulation (e.g., Hood et al., 2009).

In observations, CME-productive ARs frequently exhibit long-lived, narrow
DC ribbon pairs that are well aligned with the PIL similar to the q = 0.8 case
(see, e.g., Figure 1 of Liu et al., 2017 and Figure 3 of Avallone and Sun, 2020).
The overall patterns of jz, however, are ﬁlamentary except for the DC ribbons
(if present); evidence for a single shell of RC surrounding the DC is also lacking.
The observed Rz evolution sometimes show a fast increase with Φ and peaks
earlier than Φ (see, e.g., Figure 2 of Vemareddy, 2019 and Figure 3 of Avallone
and Sun, 2020). Their absolute values, however, are considerably lower than in
our model (Figure 5(b)). The maximum Rz is typically ∼2 for CME-productive
ARs, and at best reaches ∼4 when the central ﬂux rope structure is largely
isolated (Liu et al., 2017).

It is worth mentioning that in ideal MHD, the evolution of j is fundamentally
diﬀerent from that of B. There is no “frozen-in” theorem for j so I is not
conserved in a ﬂux tube; ∂j/∂t will depend not only on the velocity ﬁeld v and
j itself, but B as well (e.g., Inverarity and Titov, 1997). Predicting the behavior
of the electric current can be rather diﬃcult without solving the MHD equations
for the full system (Parker, 1996).

Our simplistic approach neglects a rich variety of physics during ﬂux emer-

gence. We discuss several possible eﬀects below.

• As the ﬂux tube approaches the surface, it will be ﬂattened into a sheet-
like structure due to the diminishing pressure scale height at the top of the
convection zone (Spruit, Title, and van Ballegooijen, 1987; Cheung et al.,
2008). The internal B and j distributions will change.

• The drastic expansion of the emerged ﬂux due to magnetic buoyancy in-
stabilities (section 3.3 of Cheung and Isobe, 2014) can shunt the RC to the
interface layer, as demonstrated by Longcope and Welsch (2000) and T¨or¨ok
et al. (2014).

SOLA: neutral.tex; 4 December 2020; 1:38; p. 12

Current Neutralization

• The expansion will also induce a Lorentz force, which drives twist or shear
ﬂows on the surface (Longcope and Welsch, 2000; Manchester et al., 2004;
Fang et al., 2012a). These ﬂows are capable of producing non-neutralized
currents if they act close to the PIL (Dalmasse et al., 2015).

• The emerged ﬂux may undergo internal or external reconnection to produce
a new ﬂux rope in the corona (Archontis and T¨or¨ok, 2008; Leake, Linton,
and T¨or¨ok, 2013; Takasao et al., 2015; Syntelis et al., 2019; Toriumi and
Hotta, 2019; Toriumi et al., 2020). This evolution in the magnetic ﬁeld is
reﬂected in changes of the current distribution.

• Interactions between diﬀerent emerging ﬂux regions (e.g. Chintzoglou et al.,
2019), and between existing sunspots and newly emerged regions (Fan,
2016; Cheung et al., 2019), are known to cause ﬂares. The foot prints of
the reconnecting quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs; e.g., D´emoulin, Priest, and
Lonie, 1996), demarcated by ﬂare ribbons, often overlap with the pre-ﬂare
current ribbons. Observations haven shown that the local jz can greatly
enhance during the eruption (Janvier et al., 2014).

• The buﬀeting eﬀect from the convective ﬂows may fragment the magnetic
ﬂux (Cheung et al., 2008; Mart´ınez-Sykora, Hansteen, and Carlsson, 2008;
Stein and Nordlund, 2012; Chen, Rempel, and Fan, 2017) and contribute
to the ﬁlamentary structure of jz (Yelles Chaouche et al., 2009; Fang et al.,
2012b).

Due to these eﬀects, the observed surface B and j are unlikely to be identical
to those on a subsurface horizontal slice. A distinction between poloidal and
toroidal components with respect to their subsurface origin can be diﬃcult in
practice. Nevertheless, the simple model here is capable of reproducing sev-
eral key observational features. The projection eﬀect may be important to the
photospheric current distribution, in particular during the early stages of ﬂux
emergence.

Appendix

In FG03, the ﬂux tube is kinematically lifted from subsurface (z < 0) at a
constant velocity v0 = v0 ˆz. As the tube intersects the z = 0 plane, its magnetic
ﬁeld B0 = B(z = 0) and v0 induce an ideal electric ﬁeld E ∝ −v0 × B0, which
is used as an evolving boundary condition for the domain of interest (z > 0).
The initial potential ﬁeld in the z > 0 volume interacts with the newly emerged
ﬂux, resulting in a sigmoidal ﬂux rope that eventually erupts.

For simplicity, we place the origin at r0 = (0, 0, 0) in the Cartesian coordinate.
A horizontal slice at z0 > 0 represents the photospheric condition when the tube
is centered at a depth of h = −z0 (Figure 1).

We deﬁne two auxiliary variables: ρ for the projected distance of a point r to

the origin on the y = 0 plane, and w for the distance to the tube axis:

ρ = (cid:0)x2 + z2(cid:1)1/2
w = (cid:2)(ρ − R)2 + y2(cid:3)1/2

In our convention, both the Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems are

right-handed (Figure 1). The coordinates (x, y, z) and (r, θ, φ) are related as

x = r sin θ sin φ,

z = r sin θ cos φ.

Their unit vectors ( ˆx, ˆy, ˆz) and (ˆr, ˆθ, ˆφ) are related as

A torus coordinate (w, ψ, φ) is related to the Cartesian coordinate as

x = (R + w cos ψ) sin φ,

y = −w sin ψ,

z = (R + w cos ψ) cos φ.

Here w is the radius with respect to the tube axis, and φ is the toroidal angle
with respect to the center of the torus. They are identically deﬁned as in the
spherical coordinate. The new coordinate ψ deﬁnes the poloidal angle, which
is the polar angle with respect to the tube axis. It is 0 in the x-z plane, and
increase in the same direction as θ (Figure 1).

The semi-torus tube is axisymmetric about the y-axis. However, on a cross
section with constant φ, variables are not axisymmetric about the tube axis. For
example, for jφ, the inner, lower portion of the RC sheath appears to be stronger
than other parts (Figure 7(a)).

We evaluate the Lorentz force density f = j × B on the cross section φ = 0.
As both the radial ﬁeld (Bw) and radial current density (jw) are zero, f must be
purely radial. The force points away from the axis so the tube tends to expand.
It is the strongest at the lower portion of the DC core (Figure 7(a)).

We trace ﬁeld lines in both directions from the φ = 0 plane to investigate
their lengths L and turns of twist T around the axis (Figure 7(b)). The latter
is evaluated from the change of ψ in the torus coordinate. For q = 0.8, the axis

of the semi-torus has L = πR = 1.57; ﬁeld lines passing through the lower edge
are more than twice in length due to twist. Field lines close to the axis has
T = qR/2a = 1.67; those passing slightly below the axis have a larger T due to
increased L.

For the q = 0.8 case, we ﬁnd that a portion of the ﬁeld lines may intersect the
photosphere four times (Figure 8(b)). These ﬁeld lines cross the φ = 0 plane in
a wedge-shaped region below the tube axis, where L and T are both large. This
is a result of competition between the curvatures given by the ﬂux tube axis and
by the twist in the ﬂux tube. No such ﬁeld lines are present for the q = 0.2 and
0.5 cases.
