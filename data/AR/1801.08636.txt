Abstract 

Although defects on graphene can degrade electron transport and its ability for use as a 

protection  layer,  they  can  also  be  helpful  to  tailor  the  local  properties  or  activate  new  sites  for 

particular  adsorbates.  Here,  carbon  vacancy  defects  are  formed  in  graphene  films  on  Ru(0001) 

using low energy Ar+ bombardment and the materials are then reacted at room temperature with 

oxygen  (O2).  Helium  low  energy  ion  scattering  shows  that  no  oxygen  attaches  to  the  intact 

graphene  layer.  When  isolated  single  carbon  vacancy  defects  are  present,  oxygen  adsorbs 

molecularly at the defect sites and intercalates beneath the graphene overlayer after post-annealing 

at 600 K. When the defects are large enough to consist of open areas of bare substrate, the oxygen 

dissociatively chemisorbs to the Ru. This work shows that the adsorption depends on the size of 

the  surface  vacancies,  and  that  it  is  important  to  have  defect-free  graphene  when  using  it  as  a 

protection layer.

1.  Introduction 

The epitaxial growth of uniform and large areas of graphene (Gr) with excellent quality is 

now routinely achieved by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on transition metal surfaces [1-5]. 

The  inertness  and  high  thermal  stability  of  graphene  make  it  a  good  candidate  for  use  as  a 

protective layer, especially for transition metals [6,7]. Nevertheless, in the transferring of graphene 

or in the fabrication of devices, it is inevitable that some defects, most likely carbon vacancies, 

will  be  introduced.  It  can  be  expected  that  those  defects  will  leave  unoccupied  sites  at  which 

contaminants can absorb and thus degrade the graphene’s performance over a large scale. Such a 

deviation from a perfect graphene film can, however, be useful in some applications. For example, 

such defects can be used to tailor the local properties of graphene and achieve new functionalities 

[8].  Although  defects  in  graphene  have  been  well  studied  and  widely  used,  the  relationship 

between the defects and the adsorbates on the surface is still not clear.  

One of the most important adsorbates is oxygen due to its high reactivity and abundance in 

the  atmosphere.  In  general,  at  room  temperature  O2  molecules  adsorb  dissociatively  on  metal 

surfaces forming chemical bonds to surface atoms [9-11]. Oxygen can adsorb molecularly via van 

der Waals forces at sufficiently low temperatures [11-14]. Molecular adsorption, however, can be 

observed  at  a  relatively  high  temperature  in  some  rare  cases.  For  instance,  a  small  amount  of 

oxygen can adsorb in molecular form on certain Si surfaces at room temperature in which it serves 

as precursor for dissociative chemisorption during the process of forming fully oxidized SiO2 [15] 

or as a minority species after the initial formation of a surface oxide [16].  

There  are,  however,  many  reports  of  the  adsorption  of  molecular  O2  in  the  presence  of 

defects. For example, O2 has been shown experimentally to molecularly chemisorb at two types of 

adsorption sites on TiO2 with oxygen vacancies at temperatures of 150 K and 230 K [17]. Also, 

 2 

when defects are created on Ag(111) by exposure to a high dose of chlorine, molecular oxygen 

can stick to those defects at room temperature [18]. In addition, DFT calculations have shown that 

defects on MoS2 and doped boron nitride surfaces, which are two-dimensional materials that have 

similar structures as Gr, are active sites that enable the uptake of O2 and Cl2 molecules with a much 

lower  adsorption  energy  [19,20].  It  is  thus  important  to  explore  the  possible  adsorption  of 

molecules on defected graphene at temperatures that are higher than those usually associated with 

physisorption on surfaces.  

In this paper, the relationship between defects on graphene and adsorbed O2 is studied with 

He+  low  energy  ion  scattering  (LEIS)  [21].  As  a  highly  surface  sensitive  tool,  LEIS  has  been 

previously  applied  to  measure  the  impurities  in  graphene  overlayers  [22]  and  intercalation  of 

molecules underneath the Gr overlayer [23]. In particular, by adjusting the scattering angle, LEIS 

spectra collected from Gr films can detect only the outermost atoms or can also detect intercalated 

species and uncovered substrate atoms [23]. In our previous study [23], a comparison of spectra 

collected at different scattering angles was used to show that O2 molecules intercalate between the 

Gr overlayer and the Ru(0001) substrate when exposed to O2 at 650 K, and that no oxygen adsorbs 

on the surface. Furthermore, by comparing the desorption temperature of the intercalated oxygen 

to that of oxygen chemisorbed directly on Ru(0001), it was concluded that the intercalated oxygen 

remains in molecular form.  

This work presented here details the role of carbon vacancies in promoting adsorption on 

Gr. As reported in Refs. [24,25], Ar+ sputtering can create single carbon vacancies on Gr/Pt(111) 

and graphite, as confirmed by STM images. Here, defects are introduced on Gr/Ru(0001) by 50 

eV  Ar+  pre-sputtering  before  the  material  is  exposed  at  room  temperature  to  O2.  Although  a 

complete graphene layer is inert to adsorption at room temperature, it is found that O2 does adsorb 

 3 

on pre-sputtered Gr/Ru(0001). In addition, it is observed that the size of the defects affects the 

form  of  the  adatoms  and  their  stability.  For  a  light  sputtering  that  generates  isolated  single  C 

vacancy  defects,  oxygen  adsorbs  molecularly  on  the  defect  sites  and  diffuses  to  become 

intercalated  between  Gr  and  the  Ru(0001)  substrate  following  post-annealing  at  600  K.  If  the 

vacancies  are  large  enough  to  produce  open  areas  of  exposed  substrate,  however,  then  O2 

dissociates to form strong O-Ru metal bonds.  

2. Experimental procedure 

The  experiments  are  performed  in  an  ultra-high  vacuum  (UHV)  chamber  with  a  base 

pressure  of  4×10-10 Torr. An Ar+  ion  sputter  gun (Varian)  is  used  to  clean the  Ru  substrate  and 

introduce  defects  into  the  Gr  overlayer.  Sapphire  leak  valves  are  used  to  introduce  Ar  gas  for 

sputtering  and  other  gasses  for  the  growth  of  the  Gr  overlayer  and  the  introduction  of  oxygen 

molecules. For the analysis of the surface and the confirmation of the cleanliness, the chamber is 

equipped with low energy electron diffraction (LEED) optics (Varian) and the LEIS setup, which 

is described below. The sample is mounted on a holder attached to the foot of a manipulator that 

enables x-y-z motion and rotation about both the polar and azimuthal angles. An e-beam heater 

filament is mounted behind the sample holder that can be floated at a negative high voltage to heat 

the sample up to 1400 K. The temperature of the sample is monitored with K-type thermocouples 

that are spot-welded in the vicinity of the sample. There is a Faraday cup with a 1 mm diameter 

entrance hole attached at the end of the manipulator foot for accurately measuring the ion beam 

sizes and fluxes.  

The cleaning of the ~1 cm diameter Ru(0001) sample is performed using a standard IBA 

and chemical treatment, as reported in the literature [26,27]. A 30 min 500 eV Ar+ ion sputtering 

is first applied to the Ru(0001) sample at a flux of 4×1013 ions sec-1 cm-2 with a beam size of 3×3 

 4 

 
  
 
 
cm2. The sample is then annealed under 4×10-8 Torr of O2 at 1100 K for 8 min to remove adsorbed 

carbon, followed by a flash annealing at 1300 K for 2 min under UHV to remove the remaining 

carbon-containing  contaminants  and  residual  oxygen.  This  IBA/chemical  treatment is  normally 

repeated  several  times  to  acquire  a  clean  and  well-ordered  surface.  The  cleanliness  and  the 

periodicity of the surface are confirmed with LEIS and LEED, respectively.  

The graphene overlayer is grown through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method [27]. 

The cleaned Ru surface is heated to 900 K and then exposed to 1.5×10-7 Torr of ethylene for 5 min, 

followed by annealing under vacuum at 1200 K for 1 min and then slowly cooling down to 450 K 

for another 5 min. This process is repeated until the surface is fully covered with a continuous 

monolayer of graphene, which typically requires about 4 cycles. The quality of the Gr/Ru(0001) 

overlayer is monitored with LEIS and LEED. 

Defects are formed via Ar+ sputtering of Gr/Ru(0001). To gently remove carbon from the 

graphene, a low beam energy (around 50 eV) is employed and the beam is defocused to produce 

an  average  flux  of  6.7´109  ions  sec-1  cm-2.  To  study  the  effects  of  defect  size,  two  different 

sputtering times are used. For the “light” sputtering, the beam is applied for 3 min so that the total 

fluence is 1.2´1012 ions cm-2. Considering that the lattice constant of free-standing graphene at 

room temperature is about 2.45 Å [28], it is estimated that 1 out of 167 Gr carbon atoms, or 0.6% 

of  the  surface  carbon,  is  impacted  during  this  light  sputtering.  The  second  defect  formation 

involves a 1-hour sputtering, which corresponds to a fluence of 2.4´1013 ions cm-2, so that 1 out 

of every 8 Gr carbon atoms is impacted.  

After  the  introduction  of  defects  in  Gr/Ru(0001),  O2  exposures  are  performed  with  the 

sample held at room temperature. Exposures are given in units of Langmuirs (1 L = 1x10-6 torr 

sec). Additional post-annealing under UHV is also performed after the exposures.  

 5 

 
 
The helium low energy ion scattering is performed with a differentially pumped ion gun 

(PHI model 04-303) that produces a beam diameter of 1.6 mm with a total sample current of 1.5 

nA. The scattered ions are collected by a Comstock AC-901 hemispherical electrostatic analyzer 

(ESA) mounted on a rotatable platform in the UHV chamber, which allows the scattering angle to 

be adjusted. The ESA collects only those projectiles that remain ionic after scattering. A specular 

geometry  is  used  for  all  the  spectra  collected  in  this  paper  in  which  the  incident  and  outgoing 

angles  are  always  equal  with  respect  to  the  surface  normal.  No  detectable  damage  of  the  Gr 

overlayer due to the He+ ion beam occurs within the time it takes to collect 5 successive spectra 

[23]. Thus, to absolutely avoid effects of any beam damage during LEIS, the sample is re-prepared 

after the collection of every 3 spectra.  

3. Results 

The primary tool used for these experiments is LEIS [21]. The scattering process can be 

analyzed classically because the de Broglie wavelength of low energy ions (1-10 keV) is small. In 

addition, due to the small ratio between the scattering cross sections and the interatomic spacings, 

low energy ion scattering from a solid can be analyzed with the binary collision approximation 

(BCA) in which it is assumed that the projectile interacts with only one surface atom at a time [29]. 

The most significant features in LEIS spectra are the single scattering peaks (SSP) that represent 

projectiles that experience one hard collision with a single target atom before scattering from the 

surface [21]. The position of a SSP depends on the mass of the target atom and the scattering angle, 

while the area is proportional to the number of target atoms that are directly visible to the incoming 

ions and the detector. In this experiment, the areas of the SSPs are computed by integrating the 

 6 

 
 
 
peaks  after  subtracting  the  background  of  multiply  scattered  projectiles,  which  is  modeled  as  a 

polynomial by fitting the shape of the region surrounding the SSPs.  

In the present measurements, a very light projectile, such as helium, is needed to enable 

backscattering  from  C  and  O  surface  species.  Helium  LEIS  also  has  an  extremely  high  surface 

sensitivity due to Auger neutralization (AN), which is an irreversible process that dominates for 

noble gas projectiles [21,30]. In the process of AN, most of the projectiles that collide with deeper 

layer atoms remain neutralized and are not detected by the ESA. Thus, the spectra consist primarily 

of single scattering events from the outermost few atomic layers. There is also, however, a strong 

matrix effect for helium ions scattered from graphitic carbon making it difficult to detect scattered 

He+, as reported in the literature [22,31,32]. The reason is that He ions undergo a quasi-resonant 

neutralization in conjunction with AN when scattering from graphitic carbon that leads to a very 

high  neutralization  probability  [33].  This  effect  is  particularly  significant  for  primary  beam 

energies below 2500 eV. To avoid the matrix effect and provide a detectable signal, a 3000 eV He+ 

beam energy is employed here.  

Figure  1  shows  He+  LEIS  spectra  collected  from Gr/Ru(0001)  at  a  45°  scattering  angle 

after  various  treatments.  At  this  small  scattering  angle,  the  incident  and  scattered  ions  are 

22.5° from the surface plane so that atoms positioned below the graphene overlayer are completely 

shadowed  by  the  overlayer,  which  leads  to  a  signal  that  only  probes  the  Gr  surface  and  any 

adsorbates attached to it [23].  

Spectrum  (a)  was  collected  from  the  clean,  as-prepared  Gr/Ru(0001)  and  shows  only  a 

single SSP at 2450 eV, which represents carbon in the Gr overlayer. In addition, the LEED pattern 

collected  from  this  surface  displays  a  Moiré  pattern,  as  reported  previously  [23,34],  which 

indicates that the overlayer is a single crystal that forms a superlattice with the substrate due to

their different lattice parameters. These data indicate that a complete Gr film covers the surface 

without a measurable number of defects.  

Spectrum (b) in Fig. 1 was collected after the sample was sputtered by 50 eV Ar+ for 3 min, 

which is the “light” sputtering that corresponds to a fluence of 1.2´1012 ions cm-2. The spectrum 

displays a small Ru SSP at around 2920 eV, as well as the C SSP, which indicates a small number 

of  carbon  vacancies  that  reveal  the  Ru  substrate.  The  LEED  pattern  observed  after  the  3  min 

sputtering does not change, signifying that the small number of defects created is insufficient to 

 8 

 
 
affect the alignment between the Gr overlayer and the Ru substrate. The cross section for 3000 eV 

He+ scattering from Ru is about a factor of 16 larger than for scattering from C [35], so that the 

relative changes of the Ru SSP area are much larger than those of the C SSP and the number of 

revealed Ru atoms is rather small. If it is assumed that each defect reveals a single Ru substrate 

atom and that the neutralization probability is the same for scattering from C and Ru, the ratio of 

the  Ru  SSP  to  the  C  SSP,  after  correction  for  the  cross  section  difference,  implies  that 

approximately only 0.4% of the C atoms are removed by the “light” sputtering. This number is 

similar  to the  estimate  that  0.6%  of  the  C  atoms were  impacted  by Ar+,  and  thus  suggests  that 

approximately  one  defect  is  formed  by  each  impact.  The  small  number  of  missing  C  atoms  is 

consistent with the notion that the light sputtering creates isolated, single vacancy defects that are 

randomly positioned across the surface [24,25].  

The sputtered surface was then annealed at 1000 K for 5 min, and spectrum (c) in Fig. 1 

was collected. It is seen that the areas of the C and Ru SSPs do not change with annealing, which 

infers that the vacancies induced by the light sputtering of Gr/Ru(0001) do not recover on their 

own.  Thus,  any  possible  restoration  of  the  graphene  lattice  caused  by  post-annealing  can  be 

neglected.  

After exposure to O2, 3000 eV He+ LEIS spectra were collected at a 45° scattering angle 

to probe the outermost Gr layer and any possible adsorbates, as shown in Fig. 2. Spectrum (a) was 

collected  from fully-covered  Gr/Ru(0001)  after  an  8000  L  oxygen  exposure  with the  sample  at 

room temperature. The only visible peak in the spectrum is the C SSP, which indicates that oxygen 

does  not  adsorb  on  top  of  the  carbon  atoms  in  a  continuous  graphene  layer.  Spectrum  (b)  was 

collected from Gr/Ru(0001) after a 3 min light sputtering followed by a 1500 L O2 exposure at

Figure  2.  3000  eV  He+  LEIS  spectra  collected  at  a  scattering  angle  of  45°  from  (a)  as-
prepared Gr/Ru(0001) exposed to 8000 L of O2 at 300 K, (b) Gr/Ru(0001) pre-sputtered for 
3 min and then exposed to 1500 L of O2 at 300 K, and (c) after additional annealing at 600 K

room temperature. A new peak appears at 2580 eV that represents the O SSP, while the area of C 

SSP does not change. A small Ru SSP also appears, but it is smaller than the Ru SSP from the 

sputtered  surface  prior  to  O2  exposure  shown  in  Fig.  1(b).  It  is  thus  inferred  that  randomly 

distributed single vacancies on the graphene surface enable the adsorption of oxygen, even at room 

temperature, and that the adsorbed oxygen initially sits on or near the defects so that some of the 

underlying  Ru  is  shadowed.  The  sample  was  then  annealed  to  600  K  for  10  minutes  and  re-

measured to produce spectrum (c) of Fig. 2. It is found that annealing causes the oxygen peak to 

 10 

 
disappear and the Ru signal to increase. This indicates that the adsorbed oxygen either desorbs 

from the surface or diffuses underneath the Gr after heating so that the Ru sites near the carbon 

vacancy defects are less shadowed.  

To further study oxygen adsorption on Gr/Ru(0001) with isolated C vacancies, the above 

LEIS measurement was repeated at a 120° scattering angle, as shown in Fig. 3. A larger scattering 

angle enables some ions to pass through the graphene layer making it possible to detect both the 

surface atoms and those that have intercalated beneath the Gr overlayer. Note that the SSPs occur

at lower energies than in Figs. 1 and 2 because of the larger scattering angle. From spectrum (a) in 

Fig. 3, it is found that no O2 intercalates underneath a pristine Gr film at room temperature, in 

contrast to what it does at elevated temperature [23,36]. Note that the small Ru SSP is caused by 

the He+ ions that can penetrate the overlayer and backscatter at this angle. Similar to spectrum (b) 

in  Fig.  2,  spectrum  (b)  in  Fig.  3  shows  both  O  and  Ru  SSPs  after  a  1500  L  room  temperature 

oxygen exposure. After the additional annealing to 600 K, however, the oxygen peak in Fig. 3(c) 

decreases but does not disappear as it did in Fig. 2. This indicates that the oxygen has diffused 

from the previous adsorption site at a carbon vacancy to a new position that is between the Gr 

overlayer and Ru substrate, i.e., most of the oxygen intercalates when annealed rather than desorbs. 

The small decrease in the O SSP area is likely due to the neutralization probability being larger for 

He+ scattered from buried oxygen.  

To  explore  the  relationship  between  the  oxygen  adsorption  and  defect  size,  further 

measurements  are  performed  in  which  larger  defects  are  produced  by  using  a  longer  sputtering 

time. Figure 4 shows spectra collected from a Gr/Ru(0001) sample that was sputtered for 1 hour, 

and  then  exposed  to  O2  at room  temperature  and  subsequently  annealed.  The  LEIS  spectra  are 

collected  at  a  45°  scattering  angle  so  that  any intercalated  oxygen  buried  beneath  the  graphene 

layer is not visible. Spectrum (a) was collected from the Gr/Ru(0001) sample following the 1 hour 

sputtering. The Ru SSP is much larger than that in Fig. 1(b) indicating that more Ru target atoms 

are visible to the incoming ions due to the larger vacancy defects. An analysis of the C/Ru SSP 

ratio suggests that approximately 2.3% of the carbon is removed by the 1 hour sputter. In addition, 

the Moiré pattern of Gr/Ru(0001) becomes blurry after the 1 hour sputtering indicating that the 

supperlattice structure is partially destroyed. The LEIS data collected after the sputtered sample is

Figure  4.    3000  eV  He+  LEIS  spectra  collected  at  a  scattering  angle  of  45°  from  (a)

exposed  to  1500  L  of  O2  at  room  temperature  are  shown  in  spectrum  (b). The  presence  of  the 

oxygen peak, the unchanged intensity of the carbon peak and the decrease of the size of the Ru 

peak suggest that oxygen adsorbs in the large defects and partially shadows the Ru underneath. As 

seen  in  spectrum  (c),  after  annealing the  sample  to  600  K,  both  the  O  and  the  Ru  SSPs  do  not 

change  intensity,  which  is  in  contrast  to  the  behavior  after  the  3  min  sputtering  seen  in Fig.  2. 

Considering that oxygen chemisorbed on bare Ru(0001) is very stable and does not desorb until 

being  heated  to  1200  K  [23,36],  it  can  thus  be  inferred  that  most  of  the  O2  dissociatively 

 13 

 
chemisorbs  as  atomic  oxygen  to  bare  areas  of  the  Ru  substrate  produced  by  the  prolonged 

sputtering, and does not react with the Gr film.  

4. Discussion 

An  implicit  assumption  in  this  analysis  is  the  intrinsic  stability  of the  single  C  vacancy 

defects on Gr/Ru(0001), which is based on the data shown in Fig. 1 after annealing. Indeed, free-

standing  graphene  is  able  to  reconstruct  its  lattice  in  the  presence  of  defects  under  certain 

conditions [8]. As a good example, the Stone-Wales intrinsic defect (4 hexagons are transformed 

into 2 pentagons and 2 heptagons) can occur without any removed or added C atoms after heating 

graphene over 1000 K or through mechanical strain [8,37]. For a single vacancy in graphene, the 

formation of this reconstruction is not easy, however, as the energy required has a calculated value 

of 7.5 eV [8,38], which is much higher than the vacancy formation energy of many other materials 

[39,40]. Once a single vacancy is formed by rapid quenching from high temperature, collision or 

irradiation, one carbon atom is permanently lost which can lead to the formation of 5-membered 

and 9-membered rings [25,41]. That structure is very stable so that the restoration of the single 

vacancy does not occur, as is suggested by the spectra of Fig. 1. Nevertheless, migration of single 

vacancies  is  possible  when  heated. As  reported  in  Ref.  [38],  the  calculated  migration  energy  is 

about 1.3 eV, which should allow migration at temperatures slightly above 200°C. This migration 

of the defects cannot be detected in the LEIS spectra of Fig. 1 after annealing, however, because 

of the much larger scale of the beam size (1.6 mm) compared to the graphene lattice, and because 

the diffusion of the single vacancies is completely random.  

When  a  large  number  of  C  atoms  are  removed  from  the  surface  by  sputtering,    a 

reconstruction could occur that involves bending and warping of the Gr layer due to its reduced 

 14 

 
 
surface  area  and  the  formation  of  open  regions  that  have  unsaturated  bonds  around  their 

circumference, as occurs for free standing Gr [8]. For Gr films on a substrate treated with a lengthy 

Ar+ sputtering, it is likely that the carbon vacancies migrate and coalesce after many C atoms are 

removed, even at room temperature, due to the instability of the film when it is missing too many 

carbon  atoms,  which  leads  to  the  formation  of  continuous  areas  that  are  void  of  Gr  within  an 

otherwise  crystalline  Gr  overlayer.  Such  a  case  was  observed  in  the  aberration-corrected  TEM 

images of monolayer graphene after a prolonged irradiation to a high energy electron beam [42], 

where 11% of the carbon was removed and continuous defects formed. The estimate above from 

the LEIS data is that about 2.3% of the surface consists of large areas that are void of carbon in 

which the bare Ru(0001) substrate is revealed.  

It  is  thus  shown  in  this  paper  that  the  size  of  the  vacancies  on  Gr/Ru(0001)  makes  a 

difference in the adsorption and subsequent diffusion of the oxygen. To systematically compare 

how the defect size affects the adsorption of oxygen, the Ru SSP areas collected at 45° from the 

clean surface and following the sputtering, oxygen adsorption and annealing steps are plotted in 

Fig. 5. The triangles (a) correspond to the 1 hour pre-sputtering, and the circles (b) correspond to 

the 3 min pre-sputtering. It is observed that the areas of both of the Ru SSPs increase after the pre-

sputtering due to the removal of C atoms, but the increase is larger following the longer sputtering 

time, as expected. Following a 1500 L oxygen exposure at room temperature, both Ru SSP areas 

decrease, but the magnitude of the decrease is different for the two sputtering times. This could be 

attributed to the number of available adsorption sites being different for the two cases or that the 

efficiency of oxygen adsorption at the different sites is not the same. After an additional annealing 

at 600 K for 10 min, little change of the Ru peak area is observed in (a), but the Ru SSP area in

sputtered Gr/Ru(0001) following the indicated treatments. The O2 exposures are 1500 L,

45° scattering angle. 

curve  (b)  rises  close  to  what  it  was  right  after  the  pre-sputtering,  suggesting  that  the  isolated 

vacancy sites are void of oxygen following annealing.  

The likely explanation for the behavior of lightly sputtered Gr/Ru(0001) is that the oxygen 

remains  molecular  when  attached  at  a  single  carbon  vacancy  site.  The  adsorption  of  O2  in 

molecular form on surface defects has been demonstrated previously [17,19,20]. For example, it 

has been shown from STM images that molecular oxygen species adsorbs at two different defect 

sites on rutile TiO2 at a temperature as high as 230 K [17]. Such a temperature is much higher than

it is needed to maintain molecular adsorption on the perfect TiO2 surface (60 K). In Ref. [19], two 

stable configurations of O2 adsorption on MoS2-Vs (with one sulfur vacancy) and MoS2-Vs2 (with 

two sulfur vacancies) were proposed using first principles DFT calculations. The corresponding 

adsorption  energies  are  -1.822  eV  and  -1.687  eV,  respectively,  thus  producing  a  more  stable 

structure than the perfect MoS2 surface. Additionally, a similar molecular adsorption of O2 was 

proposed for doped boron nitride with adsorption energies ranging from -1.13 eV to -5.677 eV, 

depending  on  the  type  of  dopant  [20].  The  adsorption  energy  for  molecular  oxygen  on  pristine 

boron  nitride is  only  -0.008  eV,  however,  making  it  difficult  to  occur  except  at  extremely  low 

temperatures  [20].  Thus,  it  can  be  inferred  that  single  C  vacancy  defects  in  Gr  activate  a  new 

adsorption site that stabilizes O2 molecules.  

A  question  to  be  addressed  is  whether  these  conclusions  concerning  the  adsorption  of 

species at defect sites for Gr films can be extended to free graphene. For example, the adsorption 

of molecular oxygen at single C vacancy sites could involve only bonding to other carbon atoms 

while the Ru substrate has no effect. The adsorption energy of molecular oxygen on free-standing 

graphene is, however, much affected by the type of defect per the DFT calculations of Refs. [43,44]. 

The energy of molecular oxygen adsorption on a Stone–Thrower–Wales defect is -0.17 eV, which 

should only be observed at very low temperatures [43]. Molecular adsorption at a divacancy site 

of free-standing graphene, however, has an adsorption energy about -8.48 eV, which should survive 

even above room temperature [44]. Thus, in the present case, the Ru(0001) substrate might affect 

the stability of the adsorbates at single vacancy defects. In addition, the difference of lattice sizes 

between the substrate and deposited graphene leads to a corrugation of the overlayer [45], so that 

those  carbon  vacancies  residing  at  different  sites  with  respect  to  the  substrate  might  not  be 

equivalent. This suggests that information about adsorption at single C vacancy sites on Gr films 

 17 

may not transfer to free-standing Gr, and more work is needed to determine whether or not this is 

the case.  

In the present experiment, the intercalated oxygen that diffuses at 600 K from single carbon 

vacancy  adsorption  sites  on  Gr/Ru(0001)  to  become  intercalated  completely  desorbs  when  the 

sample is heated to 1000 K for 10 min. This indicates that the intercalated oxygen is molecular as, 

according to the analysis in Ref. [23], atomic oxygen chemisorbed on Ru doesn’t desorb until 1200 

K. It can therefore be inferred that the O2 molecules are initially physically adsorbed at the vacancy 

sites before the post annealing and that such a physical bond is so weak that when the sample is 

gently  heated  to  600  K,  the  physisorbed  O2  molecules  migrate  to  find  more  stable  sites  as 

intercalates. Certainly, some oxygen could also desorb from the surface during the annealing, but 

the spectra in Fig. 3 do not show a significant change in the size of the O SSP after annealing.  

A one hour pre-sputtering of Gr/Ru(0001) leaves larger open areas of the substrate. The 

oxygen adsorbed on these exposed substrate areas is more stable and does not diffuse even after 

being  heated  to  600  K.  As  is  well  known,  the  dissociative  adsorption  of  O2  occurs  readily  on 

transition  metals  at  room  temperature  [10,11].  For  Ru(0001),  this  dissociative  adsorption  only 

requires  an  energy  of  about  0.15-0.19  eV,  which  is  obtained  at  room  temperature  [46].  On  the 

graphene overlayer, however, the dissociation energy of O2 is 2.71 eV [47], making graphene a 

good protective layer for transition metals at temperatures below 700 K [6,7]. Thus, it is likely that 

O2 easily dissociates to form strong O-Ru bonds in the open areas of bare Ru(0001) and does not 

attach to directly to, or intercalate beneath, the Gr.  

 18 

 
 
 
 
5. Conclusions 

Gr films on transition metal substrates are an important class of carbon-based materials. 

Uniform and completely covered graphene layers can be used to prevent O2 from reacting with 

transition metals. It is shown here that O2 does not adsorb on the top of Gr/Ru(0001) nor does it 

intercalate between the Gr and the substrate at sample temperatures below 450 K [36]. Oxygen 

can,  however,  adsorb  at  Gr  carbon  vacancy  defects  even  at  room  temperature.  For  isolated  C 

vacancies, the oxygen adsorbs molecularly. If the defects are large enough, then oxygen dissociates 

and  chemically  bonds  directly  to the  revealed  areas  of  bare metal  substrate.  This  indicates  that 

defects activate new adsorption sites on Gr/Ru(0001) that are not present on pristine graphene and 

that the adsorption sites of the oxygen and the stability of the adsorbates are very much affected 

by the size of the defects. These results demonstrate that it is necessary to maintain a complete 

graphene overlayer when it is being used as a protection layer, or in devices for which the Gr is 

part of a heterostructure.
