NA61/SHINE shining more light on the onset
of deconﬁnement

NA61/SHINE has recently completed data acquisition for its original pro-
gramme on strong interactions. The Collaboration has gathered rich data on
collisions of ions in a two-dimensional scan: varying the beam energy and the
sizes of colliding nuclei. The most recent analysis of hadron production in
40Ar+45Sc and 7Be+9Be interactions deliver some puzzling results which none
of the theoretical models can reproduce.

1 The NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN

NA61/SHINE (SPS Heavy Ion and Neutrino Experiment) [1] is a multi-purpose
experiment studying hadron production in hadron-proton, hadron-nucleus and
nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN SPS. The programme on strong inter-
actions includes the study of the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement [2]
and the search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter [3]. Addi-
tionally two large projects of reference measurements are ongoing on requests
of neutrino and cosmic ray physics.

The new results obtained within the strong interaction programme, that
we highlight here, concern transverse mass spectra and mean multiplicities of
the most abundant charged hadrons (π−, π+, K − and K +) produced in central
collisions of intermediate size ions, 7Be+9Be [4] and 40Ar+45Sc [5], in the beam
momentum range of 19A–150A GeV/c (√sN N = 5.12–16.83 GeV). The par-
ticle identiﬁcation was performed using data on speciﬁc energy loss (dE/dx)
measured by four large volume TPCs, which was supplemented by the mea-
surement of time of ﬂight (tof ) in a region where dE/dx distribution for various
particle species overlap (low momenta p (cid:46) 7 GeV/c). This yields results in a
large acceptance — NA61/SHINE measures particles down to zero transverse
momentum in almost complete forward hemisphere. Consequently mean mul-
tiplicities of hadrons produced in whole phase-space can be extracted. These
are very important traits of ﬁxed-target experiments.

A proper selection of most central events presents a unique experimental
challenge, especially so in case of collisions of small ions. While proton-proton
interactions can be classiﬁed as elastic or inelastic and central collisions of very

large ions of lead can be in some sense distinguished based on the multiplicity
of produced particles, neither method is well suited for ”intermediate” sys-
tems like Be+Be or Ar+Sc. Moreover, the latter method may lead to a bias,
as particle multiplicity depends on physics of interest. A procedure devised
by NA61/SHINE relies on the measurement of forward energy EF of collision
spectators in a modular calorimeter called Projectile Spectator Detector. The
most central collisions deposit the smallest energy EF . This allows for a pre-
cise, reproducible and, what is crucial, unbiased selection of central events.
Measurement of forward energy of projectile spectators is yet another trait
reserved for ﬁxed-target experiments.

2 Small and large systems

The comparative study of collisions of protons and heavy ions oﬀer an incred-
ibly rich source of information of collective behavior of strongly interacting
matter. It enables us to reach beyond elementary interactions and ask more
involved questions: what are the phases of strongly interacting matter? How
do the transitions between these phases happen? After almost 50 years of
measurements of hadron production at broad range of collisions energies and
countless theoretical attempts of explanation of quarks and gluons interplay
we have some answers, but as it is usually the case in physics — even more
questions.

In the early 2000’s the discovery of the new, deconﬁned state of strongly
interacting matter created in heavy ion collisions was announced by CERN [7]
and RHIC [8]. Just a couple years later the NA49 experiment identiﬁed the
energy at which the deconﬁnement phase-transition takes place [9]. The Col-
laboration published the measurements of Pb+Pb interactions at ﬁve collision
energies [10, 9], showing rapid changes of collision energy dependence of basic
hadron production properties, among them:

• step — a plateau in the inverse slope parameter of transverse mass

spectra of kaons,

• horn — a sharp peak in the K +/π+ ratio.

These signatures were in agreement with the ﬁrst model implementing de-
conﬁnement in heavy-ion collisions, the Statistical Model of Early Stage [11].
Moreover, they both appeared at the same collision energy (see: Pb+Pb and
Au+Au data in Figs. 1 and 2). NA49’s results were therefore interpreted as
an evidence of the onset of deconﬁnement — an energy at which the matter
created at the early stage of the collision appears in the form of quark-gluon
plasma.

Phase structure of hadronic matter becomes more and more involved cor-
respondingly to progresses in theoretical understanding of the subject and
collecting more and more experimental data. While the largest experimentally
available now energies at LHC and RHIC colliders seem to provide data related
to the crossover region between quark-gluon plasma and hadron gas then the
SPS ﬁxed-target NA61/SHINE experiment is particularly suited to explore the
hypothetical ﬁrst-order phase transition line with the critical point included.
The phases of QCD matter depend on two primary parameters: temper-
ature T and baryo-chemical potential µB. With changing the energy of the

2

collision we can traverse the phase-diagram in a particular direction — in-
creasing collision energies results in smaller µB and larger T . In order to study
a broader domain of the QCD phase-diagram we also vary the sizes of col-
liding nuclei. Hence with the NA61/SHINE’s unique two-dimensional scan in
collision energy and system size we seek the signatures of the onset of decon-
ﬁnement, aiming to pinpoint the location of the phase-transition line.

Intermediate size ions

Figure 1: Measurements of the K +/π+ ratio at mid-rapidity (left plot) and
in whole phase space ”4π” (on the right) in dependence on collision energy
√sN N . Very pronounced diﬀerences between data on p+p (blue) and Pb+Pb
(red) collisions were identiﬁed as a signature of the onset of deconﬁnement
in Pb+Pb interactions. New data on intermediate size systems, collisions of
Be+Be (green) and Ar+Sc (orange), were recently measured by NA61/SHINE.

So what do we learn from the new NA61/SHINE’s data on Be+Be and
Ar+Sc reactions? Let us focus on the most prominent signature of the onset
of deconﬁnement — the ”horn”. The phase transition seems apparent in the
characteristic, non-monotonic behavior of the kaon over pion ratio in central
heavy ion collisions (see: Pb+Pb and Au+Au in Fig. 1). In case of intermedi-
ate size systems however, no such vivid structure is present. Nevertheless, two
interesting features demand attention. Firstly, a clear distinction between two
data sets is visible — p+p and Be+Be results cluster around similar values,
while Pb+Pb, Au+Au and Ar+Sc show much higher K +/π+ ratios. Secondly,
although Ar+Sc is clearly separated from small systems its energy dependence
does not resemble the sharp peak seen in heavy-ion reactions [14]. No theoret-
ical description can reproduce this behavior — neither statistical [11, 12] nor
dynamical models [13].

Complementary to the above, Fig. 2 displays the energy dependence of the
inverse slope T , ﬁtted to the transverse mass spectra of charged kaons (K + and
K −). In central heavy ion collisions we see a characteristic step-like behavior.
Under assumption that the parameter T can be treated as a vague analogy
of temperature, it can be considered as a strong interactions analogy of the
ice-water phase-transition. Once again we notice the proximity of p+p and
Be+Be measurements. Similarly T obtained for Ar+Sc collisions is higher,

also visible for smaller systems: Be+Be and Ar+Sc.

4 Onset of ﬁreball

The observed rapid change of hadron production properties that starts when
moving from Be+Be to Ar+Sc collisions hints a beginning of the creation of
large clusters of strongly interacting matter — the onset of ﬁreball [16]. The
similarities of p+p and Be+Be systems suggests that interactions of these
systems could form small non-equilibrium clusters via binary collisions of nu-
cleons, exactly like in the Wounded Nucleon Model [15]. On the other hand
properties of Pb+Pb collisions are pretty well described by statistical and hy-
drodynamical models, which assume creation of collectively evolving ﬁreball.
Results on Ar+Sc collisions are clearly closer to the Pb+Pb ones than to p+p
and Be+Be measurements. Summarizing, we could distinguish four domains of
collision dynamics, split by the two critical phenomena: the onset of deconﬁne-
ment and the onset of ﬁreball, as seen in Fig. 3. The onset of deconﬁnement
from conﬁned matter to quark-gluon plasma is well established in the ﬁreball
region at high masses of the colliding nuclei, while its presence in the small
cluster regime is still an open question — an incredibly interesting question,
certainly deserving a separate study.

5 Extension beyond 2020

The quest for understanding the phases of strongly interacting matter contin-
ues and many unanswered questions remain [17]. In the following we brieﬂy
present the next steps of NA61/SHINE.

The second stage of the NA61 experiment, starting after the Long Shut-
down 2 (LS2) would include measurements of charm hadron production
in Pb+Pb collisions. The main objective is to obtain the ﬁrst data on mean
number of ¯cc pairs produced in the full phase space in heavy ion collisions.

to collisions in the SPS energy range. On top of the onset of deconﬁnement,
there is an onset of ﬁreball – beginning of creation of large clusters with in-
creasing system size. It is still unclear what happens with collisions of small
nuclei with increasing collision energy.

To highlight the need for such measurements let us note that the theoretical
production at top SPS energy diﬀer by about two
predictions concerning
orders of magnitude [18]. Moreover, further new results will give us new in-
sights on the collision energy and centrality dependence. These data will help
to answer the long-standing questions about the mechanism of open charm
production, about the relation between the onset of deconﬁnement and open
charm production, and about the behaviour of J/ψ in quark-gluon plasma.

NA61/SHINE is the only experiment which will conduct such measure-
ments in the near future. Together with other heavy ion experiments it creates
a full-tone physical picture of QCD in dense medium.
