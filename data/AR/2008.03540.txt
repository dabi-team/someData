Abstract. The characteristic of the lateral interaction of two plasma plumes in argon
Ar background gas at high pressures was reported in recent publication [Yadav et. al.,
J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 50, 053421 (2017)]. Further we have investigated the
interaction characteristics of plumes in He, N e, Ar and Xe background gases to see
the eﬀect of mass on the interaction. The present work illustrate the applicability of the
present model for theoretical understanding of dynamics, structure, density variation,
shock wave formations and their interactions of two propagating plasma plumes in a
wide range of ambient conditions. The formation of interaction region, geometrical
shape and strength of the shock fronts and subsequent regular and Mach reﬂections
in accordance with the nature and pressure of ambient gas are successfully captured
in the simulations. The observed results are supported by the reported experimental
observations under identical conditions.

Numerical study of the eﬀect of mass of the background gas on the lateral interactions of two plasma plumes at high pressure2

1. Introduction

Laser interaction with matter and subsequent evolution of target material as a form of
plasma plume has a variety of applications in many areas such as pulse laser deposition,
nano-particles/clusters formation, material processing, elemental analysis, lithography,
atmospheric plasma and plasma diagnostics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Many parameters such as
laser wavelength and energy density, properties of material (e.g. thermal conductivity,
heat capacity, density) and also the reﬂectivity and absorption of material collectively
govern the plasma formation. Hence the basic mechanism of the formation and the
evolution of laser produced plasma plume is a complex process and its theoretical
understanding continues to be a challenging task.

Apart from the extensive research on single laser plasma plume, the interaction
between the plasma plumes, also known as colliding plasmas [8] has been subject of
great interest because of its applications in laser ion source, inertial conﬁnement fusion
(ICF), and laboratory simulation and modelling of astrophysical plasma phenomena
[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. When the plasma plumes interact under certain conditions,
an interaction region or plasma jet likes structure is formed [15]. The dynamics and
plasma parameters of this additional jet like structure is depend on the geometry of
the interaction and plasma parameters of interacting plumes (seed plumes). Several
experiments have been done to manipulate the induced plasma jet like structure by
using the diﬀerent interaction geometry, e.g. head-on collisions, angular and lateral
interactions where the seed plasma plumes are generated with wide range of laser
intensities [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The increasing interest in colliding plasmas induced
interaction reason is largely due to its better control of the plasma parameters and
geometrical shape in accordance with its applications.

Plasma jet produced by energetic colliding plasmas immersed as a important tool
for laboratory scaled model of various astrophysical phenomenon [12, 13, 14]. Camps
et. al. [22] utilize the colliding plasma to produce an aggregate-free materials source.
Y. Hirooka et. al.
[23] study the Aerosol formation and hydrogen co-deposition by
colliding ablation plasma plumes from plasma facing element. Further colliding plasmas
is used to understand the stagnation on hohlraum axis and capsule implosions in ICF
[10, 11]. In addition to the widely explored the collision between the conventional laser
produced plasmas, recently several experiments have been conducted to understand the
interaction between the Laser-Blow-Oﬀ (LBO) of the thin ﬁlm [24, 25]. Due to the
diﬀerence in ablation mechanism, the thermal history, composition and evolution of
LBO plume is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from plasma plume produced by bulk solid target
[26]. Since the major constituents of LBO plume is neutral species and therefore the
interaction between LBO plasmas can be used to generate the directed beam of neutral
species for tokomak plasma diagnostics [27, 28].

In spite of extensive application oriented work on the laser produced colliding
plasma plumes, its theoretical understanding are scarce in the literature. Also the
interaction between the plasma plumes in presence of ambient gas is more complex in

Numerical study of the eﬀect of mass of the background gas on the lateral interactions of two plasma plumes at high pressure3

comparison to the case of vacuum because of the presence of shock front ahead of the
plasma plume [29, 30, 31]. In presence of shock front, the iteration between the plumes is
governed by shock-shock collision and its reﬂection [24]. The understanding of colliding
shock is important, especially in probing the astronomical object in laboratory scale
[12, 13].

Recently, we have simulated the lateral interactions between two spatially separated
LBO plasma plumes in the presence of argon ambient [32]. In this approach, continuity,
momentum and the energy equations of ablated material are solved numerically in two
dimension [32, 33]. In this numerical study we showed the formation of shock waves
and their interactions in argon ambient which is in good agreement with experimental
observations [32]. Since evolution of the plasma plume and also the geometrical shape
and strength of the shock wave is depends on the on the pressure and mass of the ambient
gas; which collectively determine the dynamics and structure formation of the induced
interaction region. Therefore we are motivated to look more closely the interactions
between the LBO plumes in wide range of ambient environment.

In extension of our earlier work [32], here we report the two dimensional numerical
simulation of interaction of LBO plume in He, N e, Ar and Xe background. These
background gases are chosen because of large diﬀerence in their atomic masses and the
physical parameters.

2. Modeling of Plasma Plumes and Numerical Simulation

2.1. Basic ﬂuid equations:

We modeled the time evolution of plasma-plume in the ambient gas using basic ﬂuid
equations that include mass, momentum and energy equations.

In eq. (1) ρ is the mass density of whole system i.e. ρ = ρv + ρb; ρv is the plume
density (also known as vapor density) and ρb is the background gas density; (cid:126)u is the
ﬂow velocity.

is the mass of the background gas species. Ωv is the vapor mass density fraction i.e.

2.2. Simulation, melting and vaporization of the target material:

Experimental study suggest that the time evolution of plasma plume in the background
gas is the axis symmetry phenomena. So to avoid the mathematical complexity and

Numerical study of the eﬀect of mass of the background gas on the lateral interactions of two plasma plumes at high pressure5

also the computational expenses required in order to perform the numerical study in
three-dimension (3D), we carry out simulation in two-dimension (2D). Therefore we
solved Eqs. (1 − 4) numerically in two-dimension (2D) using the ﬂux corrected scheme
of Boris et. al. [36].

In ﬁgure 1 we displayed the schematic diagram of 2D computational domain and
boundary conditions imposed on the boundaries. We used solid wall and inﬂow boundary
conditions for the boundary. In solid wall boundary conditions the velocity component
normal to boundary is taken to be zero and also the gradient of the quantities pressure
p, transverse component of velocity vy and density ρv normal to the boundary are
set to zero. In inﬂow boundary condition the normal component of the ﬂow velocity
vx at the boundary should be constant, pressure and density is also constant at the
boundary. Boundaries assigned by the numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 is kept at the solid wall
boundary condition through the simulation. Region 2 are the locations where the plasma
plume will be produced throughout the ablation process. So region two is kept at
inﬂow boundary boundary condition during the ablation process. When the plumes
are completely formed in the computational space, region 2 is switched with the solid
wall boundary condition. Time required in the ablation process is computed using the
formula, tvap = Ma
ρvvvA where Ma is the mass of the ablated thin ﬁlm which can be
evaluated from the density of the ﬁlm, its thickness and the cross-section area A of the
focused laser spot.

Surface temperature Ts of the ablated material is calculated by equating the incident
laser energy with the energy required for the melting of the target material and further
its vaporization.

FLA(1 − R) = MAcS(Tboi − Tr) + (TS − Tboi) + MAλe

or,

Ts = Tr +

FLA (1 − R) − MAλe

(10)

(11)

Where FL is the laser ﬂuence, A is the spot size of the laser, R is the reﬂectivity, cS
is the speciﬁc heat of material, λe is the latent heat of evaporation, Tboi is the boiling
temperature and Tr is the room temperature. Further we use Ts for the computation of
the surface pressure ps using the the Clausius-Clapeyron equation [35],

ps = p0exp

(12)

Here Tboi is normal boiling temperature at standard pressure p0 and ∆Hvap is the
vaporization enthalpy at temperature of Tboi at standard pressure p0. The ablated
material from the surface moves towards the ambient gas and the Knudsen layer is
formed whose thickness is of the order of a few mean free paths. In the Knudsen layer
there is a drop in both temperature as well as the pressure of the ablated material by
the following factors:

T = 0.67Ts; p = 0.21ps

(13)

Numerical study of the eﬀect of mass of the background gas on the lateral interactions of two plasma plumes at high pressure6

Our computational domain starts after this Knudsen layer. Therefore we use Eq. (13)
for the estimation of the temperature T and pressure p of the inﬂowing ablated material.
These then decide density ρv of the incoming ablated material (used in Eq. (14)) from
the ideal gas law. The velocity with which the vapor enters the ambient medium is
approximated by the velocity of sound.

3. Numerical Results and Discussion

(1 − 4) for the study of the lateral interaction of two
We solved numerically Eqs.
plasmaplumes in the presence of the various background gases. The background gases
considered in the simulations are He, N e, Ar and Xe. The separation between the
plumesare considered ∼ 5mm. The simulations are performed at two background
pressures 1 and 3 mbar in the all cases.

Time evolution of the plumes at 1 mbar and 3 mbar background pressure in the
presenceof He, N e, Ar and Xe are shown in Figures 2 and 3 respectively. Visible
examination of the images in ﬁgure 2 clearly show the eﬀect of mass of ambient gas
on the dynamics of expanding plasma plumes. In case of lighter gas i.e. He, plasma
plume expands linearly up to the considered time delay as similar to the expansion in
vacuum. An additional fable semicircular structure appeared ahead of the plasma plume
at time delay 508 ns which is attributed as shock front. Here, the sound wave velocity
cs in He, N e, Ar and Xe are 10.22 × 102 m/s, 4.54 × 102 m/s, 3.23 × 102 m/s and
1.78 × 102 m/s respectively. Using relation (14) the estimated initial plume velocity is
∼ 1.12 × 104 m/s, which is much higher than the sound wave velocity in the considered
medium. This satisfy the strong shock condition especially in heavier background gas.
The shock fronts are diﬀerent to each other in terms of size and intensity depending
upon background gas used in the simulation. In case of N e, shock front is clearly visible
at 304 ns whereas it appears further earlier ∼ 208 ns in the case of heavier ambient
gases that is Ar and Xe. Also the shock front is strengthened and more intense in
heavier background gas.

In order to further study of the dynamics of plasma induced shock waves, axial-
plume-dimensions (distance from the target to shock front) are analysed as a function of
time. Figure 5 shows the variation of the distance of the shock-front from the target (also
known as shock-distance) with time for all the cases of the simulation of the ambient
gas performed at 1 mbar pressure.

In all cases we observe that initially for a very short time period, plasma plume
expands linearly in all background gases. After a certain time delayed depending upon
the mass of the background gas, the expansion of the plume is deviated from the linear
expansion and it follows ∼ t0.4 dependence (see ﬁgure 5).
It is clearly visible in our
simulation as shown in ﬁgure 2, 3 and 4 where in heavier background gas shock wave
initiated earlier in comparison to that observed in the case of the simulation of lighter-
gas at a ﬁxed background pressure. Delayed non-linear expansion behavior and its
dependence on the mass of the background gas is in agreement with the blast wave
model that describe the expansion of the massive-shock present in the gases system.
In ﬁgure 6 we observe that shock front appears roughly at 0.012 m, 0.009 m, 0.008
m and 0.006 m from the target surface for the case He, N e, Ar and Xe respectively
at time t = 508.0 ns. The limiting characteristic distance (R) for the shock front can
be estimated by equating the mass of the gas encompassed by shock wave and initial
abalted mass (Ma), that is R = (3Ma/2πρb)1/3 where ρb is the density of background

Numerical study of the eﬀect of mass of the background gas on the lateral interactions of two plasma plumes at high pressure8

gas. The estimated distance of the shock front (R) at which the shock wave model is
valid for 1.0 mbar pressure of He, N e, Ar and Xe are 0.018 m, 0.01 m, 0.0083 m and
0.0057 m respectively. Hence our simulation roughly capture the limiting characteristics
distance (plume length) for shock wave expansion as shown in Figure 6.

In order to get more insight into the intensity jump at the shock front and its
strength in diﬀerent background gases, the intensity proﬁles along the expansion axis
are analyzed at onset of time.

Variation of intensity/density in the plasma plume at 1 mbar pressure and t = 508.0
ns along the expansion axis (x−axis) and at y ∼ 0.15 m for all the cases of simulation
of background gases is shown in Figure 6. The density jump ahead of the plasma plume
due to shock wave formation and its delayed appearance with the decrease of the mass
of background gas is clearly visible in Figure 6. Also the intense and sharp intensity
jump in the simulation of Xe background gas in comparison to the He background gas
reveals that shock strength (reciprocal of shock thickness) is higher in case of heavier
background atoms/gas.

Further, simulated results depicted in Figures 2 and 3 are also compared with
theoretically predicted shock-front velocity and density. According to the theory, the
shock wave parameters especially the shock-front density and shock-front velocity could
be determined based on the mass and energy conservation formula as given below:

Vs ≈

Va

ρs ≈

Where Vs and Va are the shock-front velocity and velocity of the plume during the
initial time evolution of the plume respectively. γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats at
constant pressure and volume. As, in our simulation we are using the monatomic gas
so the value of γ is 1.67. ρs and ρb are the shock front density and background density
respectively. Thus according to the a above formula if massive shock is present in the
system then the shock density should be roughly ∼ 4.0ρb and shock wave velocity,
Vs ∼ 1.34Va. The simulated density at the shock fronts in the case of He, N e, Ar
and Xe are 2.5 × 10−3, 8.3 × 10−3, 1.25 × 10−2 and 2.0 × 10−2 respectively in the

that is ρHe

b ∼ 8.1 × 10−4, ρAr
(in the unit of kg/m3), the value of shock front density is always greater than ∼ 10
times of the background density in all cases of the simulation which is overestimated
the theoretical value of the ideal blast wave model.

which plume enter the simulation space in the presence of background gas. Note that
plume velocity Va does not change signiﬁcantly during the initial time evolution of the
plume in the background gas. Later when strong shock present in the system then the
average shock velocity Vs is determined using the ﬁtting parameters α and β. α and β
are constants, appear in the function αt0.4 + β (also known as a Taylor Sedov model)
that is used to ﬁt the shock front position vs. time curve (see Figure 5). The value of
α and β depends upon the mass of the background gas. In the case of the simulation of
Xe background gas, the estimated shock velocity Vs is ∼ 1.69 × 104 m/s. This value is
approximately 1.5 times of the initial plume velocity Va that is in good agreement with
the theoretical approximation (Vs/Va = 1.3). Values of α and β, and shock velocity Vs
are summarized in table I for the simulation of all the ambient gases performed at 1
mbar pressure.

Another noteworthy observation of the present simulation is that it predict
the density discontinuity in between the plasma plume and shock front due to the
hydrodynamic movement of plume and shock front as reported by several experimental
works in the past. Two region of discontinuity is clearly visible in case of the simulation
of the background gases N e and Ar as shown in Figure 6. While in the case of the
simulation of Xe background gas this is not visible due to the nominal separation
between the plume and shock-front. Also in the case of the simulation of He background
gas this discontinuity is not clearly visible, here it is because of the weak-shock condition
(see Figure 6). In most of the previous work, the ﬁrst discontinuity is attributed to the
ionized shocked gases just behind the shock front. Whereas the second discontinuity,
known as contact surface (CS) which is the boundary of ablated species. Using the
Westwood model [37] we can easily understand the change in the direction of carbon
species in a single collision with N e and Ar background gas species. Thus, elastic
scattering between the leading plume species and heavier background atoms play the
signiﬁcant role in the build-up of the density in the CS region.

Apart from the characteristic expansion of the plasma plume and shock wave
formation, our simulation also capture the most of the features of lateral interactions
between two spatially separated plumes and its dependence on the background
conditions (that is pressure and mass of the background gas.The earlier studies report

propagating plasma plumes in close proximity. Due to the angular distribution of the
plume species, interaction between the counter propagating plume species with the
condition η = D
λ >> 1, is responsible for the formation of interaction region. Where η,
D and λ are respectively, the collisionality parameter, separation between the plumes
and collision frequency. For the higher value of η, the counter propagation energetic
particles lose energy rapidly due to multiple collisions and formed the interaction region.
Thus the value of η deﬁne whether the interaction between the plumes result into
the interpenetration or it simply turned into the interaction zone (as observed in the
simulation).

The one to one comparison between the images observed in diﬀerent background
gas and pressure (as shown in Figures 2 and 3) indicates that dynamics and geometrical
structure of the expanding vapour, shock front and interaction zone at 1 mbar N e
pressure is nearly similar to the simulated images at 3 mbar He pressure. On the
same way, the characteristics of the plumes and its interaction pattern at 1 mbar of
Xe pressure resembles that observed at 3 mbar Ar pressure. Based on the above
observations, the interaction mechanism between the plumes is broadly divided into
two region that is in the region where absence or weak shock condition and presence
of strong shock front. In absence of shock front, for example at 208 ns and 304 ns in
He and at 208 ns in N e background at 1 mbar pressure (see, ﬁgure 2), an additional
luminous components in between the plumes in our simulation is treated as conventional
interaction region formed by the multiple collisions between the counter propagating
species at the middle of two expanding plumes.

The present simulation is also predict the higher expansion velocity of interaction
region in comparison to interacting plumes, which is in excellent agreement with
previously reported experimental results. Scenario is diﬀerent in presence of shock wave
ahead of plume where shock-shock interaction and subsequent reﬂections come in picture
along with the interaction between plume species. With the assumption of collision
between two planner shock fronts, shock-shock interactions and its subsequent reﬂections
is classiﬁed as regular and Mach reﬂections depending upon the shock strength and angle
of incidence with respect to the plane of symmetry.

The carefull examination of the simulated images in case of N e and Ar at 1 mbar
pressure and at time delay > 200 ns (Figure 2) and also at 3 mbar of He pressure
(Figure 3), It can be clearly seen that shock fronts are physically interact at the middle
of the two plumes. In this simulation both plume is identical and therefore point of
interaction is always lying in the middle and moving along the expansion axis with time
as observed in Figure 2. This good agreement with theoretically predicted interaction
and regular reﬂection of two relatively weak shock fronts. Also the predicted structure
of the interaction zone is an excellent agreement with the experimental observation in
the similar condition.

On the other hand in case of heavier background gas (Ar and Xe) and especially
at higher pressure and later time delay where the strong shock is predicted, luminous

interaction region is not observed in simulation even at highest considered time delay
( see, Figure 3). Also in contrast to the weak shock condition, physical overlapping
between the shock fronts is not observed in this region. The density discontinuity in
between the plumes is clearly visible in 3 mbar pressure of Ar and Xe at 500 ns time
delay (Figure 3) where the interacting shock wings is seems to repelled each other and
hence completely suppressed in opposite direction. This observation is resembled with
the case of Mach reﬂection between the two interacting strong shock fronts. In this case
point of reﬂection is split into two symmetrical points and move in opposite direction
in plane perpendicular to expansion axis. The reﬂections from these two points restrict
the escape of plume species and form the density discontinuity in between the plume as
shown in Figure 3.

Interaction between the plumes as well as shock fronts and its dependence on the
shock strength is represented in better way by comparing the interactions of plasma
plumes in He and Xe background gases at 3 mbar pressure as shown in Figure 4. As
discussed earlier, conventional interaction region is observed at ∼ 200 ns in He where
the shock front is insigniﬁcant. Even at 3 mbar He pressure, relatively weak shock
is predicted in our simulation. Thus the simulated structure of interaction region at
t > 200 ns is in line with the interaction between two weak shock fronts. However the
complete suppression of overlapping of plume species and shock wings and hence the
formation of interaction zone because of Mach reﬂection between the strengthen shock
front in Xe background is correctly predicted in our simulation.

In this simulation we successfully predicted the most of the features of colliding
plumes and shock fronts and also the transition from regular to Mach shock reﬂection
in reference of weak and strong shock conditions.

4. Conclusion

In this work we presented the numerical simulation of the evolution of two spatially
separated plasma plumes in the presence of He, N e, Ar and Xe background gases at 1
and 3 mbar pressures. The features of expanding plasma plumes in close proximity and
interaction between them in diﬀerent background gas captured in the present simulation
are in close agreement with the reported experimental observations [25]. Eﬀect of
mass of ambient gas on plume dynamics, initiation of shock waves, shape and strength
of shock front and variation of the density/intensity in the plume as well as shock
region is precisely reproduced in the simulation. Further lateral interaction between the

constants, and its value depends upon the background gas and pressure. The value of
α and β are summarized in table I.

two expanding plumes and formation of interaction region are also predicted well by
the simulations. The structure formation because of the shock-shock interaction and
reﬂection observed in simulation is in good agreement with the experimental results. The
observed results suggest the presence of the regular shock-reﬂection in the cases of the
simulation of He and N e background gases and Mach-reﬂection in the cases of Ar and
Xe simulations especially at later time. The simulation in the diﬀerent ambient gases
demonstrate the transition from regular to Mach reﬂections of shock wave depending
upon the shock strength.
