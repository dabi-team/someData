The scintillation yield for recoil Ar ions of 5 to 250 keV energy in liquid argon have been evaluated for direct 
dark matter searches. Lindhard theory is taken for estimating nuclear quenching. A theoretical model based on 
a biexcitonic diffusion-reaction mechanism is performed for electronic (scintillation) quenching. The electronic 
LET (linear energy transfer) is evaluated and used to obtain the initial track structure due to recoil Ar ions. The 
results  are  compared  with  experimental  values  reported  for  nuclear  recoils  from  neutrons.  The  behavior  of 
scintillation and ionization on the electric field are discussed.

I. Introduction 

Dark matter search is one of most important issue 
in physics and astrophysics today. The astronomical 
observations  show  the  distribution  of  the  unseen 
mass is different from that of ordinary matter [1]; the 
evidence suggests that the dark matter does not have 
efficient  energy-loss  mechanisms  such  as  photon 
emission  and  inelastic  collisions  through  molecular 
formation  and  condensation,  etc.  One  of  the  most 
probable  dark  matter  candidates  is  WIMP,  Weakly 
Interacting Massive Particle [2-4]. Dual-phase noble-
gas  time  projection  chambers  (TPC)  are  the  most 
sensitive  detectors  for  direct  detection  of  galactic 
dark  matter  [5,6].  Liquid  Ar  is  used  for  large  scale 
WIMP  detectors.  Ionizing  particles  produces  a 
prompt luminescence S1 and electrons in liquid phase. 
The electrons are extracted into gas phase where they 
produce proportional scintillation  S2. Detection and 
selection of signals by WIMP, i.e. recoil Ar ions in a 
the 
liquid  argon  dark  matter  detector,  exploit 
differences  in  scintillation  efficiency,  scintillation 
decay  shape  and  charge  collection  due  to  electrons 
and recoil ions. 

It is essential to know the scintillation efficiency 
for  nuclear  recoil  produced  by  WIMPs  striking 
nucleus in detector media to construct the recoil ion 
energy E. The energy of recoil ions is expected to be 
a  few  keV  to  a  few  hundreds  keV.  For  such  slow 
particles, only a part of energy E given to electronic 
excitation can be used in ionization and scintillation 
detectors  [7].  In  addition  to  nuclear  quenching, 
electronic  quenching  due  to  high-excitation  density 
has to be considered in condensed phase scintillators 
[8].  It  is  the  electronic  LET  (LETel,  linear  energy 
transfer),  not  the  electronic  stopping  power,  that 
gives  the  number  of  excited  species  (excitons  and 
electron-ion pairs) produced per unit length along the 
track  [8,9].  The  evaluation  of  LETel  and  the  track

In this paper, the so-called core and penumbra of 
heavy-ion track structure is considered and improved 
for understanding the track due to slow recoil ions. A 
quenching  theory  based  on  a  biexcitonic  diffusion-
reaction  mechanism  is  proposed  and  performed  for 
electronic  (scintillation)  quenching  [10].  The  total 
quenching is obtained as a function of the energy and 
compared with the measurements. The sum signal, S1 
and S2, is discussed for the reconstruction of recoil 
ion energy. We refer rare gases as argon and xenon, 
hereafter. 

II. Stopping power and electronic LET 

For the interaction of slow ions with matter, the 
nuclear  stopping  power  Sn  is  of  the  same  order  of 
magnitude as the electronic stopping power Se [7,11] 
as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  We  refer  slow  ions  that  the 
velocity v is v < v0, where v0 = e2/ħ ≈ c/137 = 2.2×108 
cm/sec is the Bohr velocity, e is the charge of electron, 

 
 
 
 
 
and c is the velocity of the light. The total stopping 
power ST is the sum of the two;  

ST = Sn + Se .

The nuclear process follows the usual procedure of a

(d/d)e ≈  k1/2, where    is the dimensionless range 
and k is the electronic stopping constant. The results

0.145 for Ar ions in argon. The stopping power cross 
sections  discussed  above  give  the  same  values  as 
those in the HMI tables [15] at a low E. The stopping 
powers  in  liquid  were  obtained  simply  taking  the 
density  (1.40  g/cm3  for  liquid  argon)  into  account, 
since  uncertainty  in  the  theory  is  larger  than  the 
difference in stopping powers in gas and liquid.  

Lindhard  et  al.  [7]  have  performed  numerical 
calculations and given the partition of energy  of the 
incident  ions  to  nuclear  motion  υ  and  electronic

Born’s  approximation  is  invalid  for  the  low 
velocity  region.  Therefore,  the  Bethe  theory  of  the 
stopping power is inapplicable to ion-atom collisions 
concerns  here.  The  maximum  energy  given  to  the 
target  atom  is  usually  given  by  the  kinematically 
limited maximum energy Qmax = 4Eme/M where me is 
the electron mass and M is the mass of the projectile. 
For Ar ions, 4me/M ~ 4/(2000×40), then  Qmax is ~10 
eV at E = 200 keV. The lowest excitation energy for 
Ar is about 11 eV. Then, the crude estimate shows no 
electronic excitation below 200 keV and Se becomes 
zero.  However,  no  kinematic  cut-off  in  electronic 
excitation  have  been  observed.  The  kinematic 
limitation implies the ordinary approach in ion-atom 
collisions is not adequate. Lindhard et al. have taken 
a dielectric-response approximation [13]. The source

S = Z1eE·(v/v), where E is the electric field, for the 
electron  gas.  They  applied  the  theory  for  ions-atom

III. Heavy ion track structure 

The  heavy-ion  track  can  be  regarded  as  a  co-axial 
cylindrical geometry consist of the high-density core 
and surrounding less dense penumbra [16]. The core 
is mostly due to glancing collisions and the penumbra 
is formed by -rays produced by knock-on collisions. 
The  local  dose  distribution  in  penumbra  is  roughly 
scale as r-2, where r is the radius, and the diameter is 
given by the range of maximum energy -rays. Since 
electronic quenching take place in the core of heavy 
ions, we consider excitation density in the core. The 
total  (electronic)  energy  T  given  to  the  liquid  is 
divided into the core Tc and into the penumbra Tp. 
The energy Ts available for scintillation is,  

(11) 

where q and qc are the overall quenching factor and 
that in the core, respectively. The initial radial dose 
distribution  in  track  core  may  be  approximated  as 
Gaussian with the core radius a0 [10], 

 , 

(12) 

where LETc is the linear energy transfer in the core 
and is the sum of contribution of glancing collision 
 left by -rays. The core radius a0 is 
LET/2 and LETc
given  by  Bohr’s  impulse  principle,  rB  =  ħv/2E1, 
where  ħ  is  Plank’s  constant  divided  by  2,  v  is  the 
velocity of incident ion and E1 is the energy of lowest 
electronic  excited  state  of  the  medium.  For  liquid 
argon, E1 = 12.1 eV.  

The  track  structure  for  slow  recoil  ions  is 
different  from  the  core  and  penumbra  of  heavy-ion 
track  structure  discussed  above.  For  recoil  ions,  rB 
becomes  less  than  the  interatomic  distance  a,  in 
which case a is taken for a0. We assume most -rays 
produced by recoil ions do not have sufficient energy 
to  effectively  escape 
the  core  and  form  an 
undifferentiated core. Then, the radial distribution of 
the track may be approximated as a single Gaussian 
and LETc in Eq. (11) is replaced by LETel for recoil 
ions. The excitation density can be so high that the 
number  density  of  excited  species  ni  estimated  can 
exceed the number density n0 of liquid argon as for 
fission 
should  occur, 
redistribution of energy and core expansion may take 
place, a0 is determined so that ni does not exceed n0. 
The initial radial distribution of track core for various 
ions are shown in Fig. 2.  The tack structures due to 
various ions are also discussed in Ref. 17.

gases. An arrow kn1 shows a biexcitonic collision 
that  is  the  proposed  mechanism  for  electronic 
quenching. 

In  condensed  rare  gases,  both  ionization  and

recombination and/or relaxation, eventually give the

 . 

(13) 
Since,  the  lifetimes  of  the  vuv  emission  do  not 
depend on LET or  the existence of quenching [18], 
quenching occurs prior to self-trapping. Free excitons 
Ar* and/or highly excited species may be responsible 
for 
the  quenching.  The  proposed  quenching 
mechanism is a bi-excitonic collision [10]. 

.    

(14) 

The  ejected  electron,  e-,  may  immediately  lose  its 
kinetic  energy  KE  close  to  one  excitation  before 
recombines with an ion. The overall result is that two 
excitons  are  required  for  one  photon.  It  should  be 
noted  that  Eq.  (14)  applies  to  excitons  formed 
directly or ion recombination. 

IV.1. The α-core approximation 

The initial radial distributions of excited species 
in the track core for recoil Ar ions and α particles are 
similar  to  each  other  as  shown  in  Fig.  2.  A  crude 
estimate  has been made  assuming  that qel for recoil 
Ar ions is constant and the same as qc for -particles. 
The  approximation  was  applied  before  for  liquid 
xenon  with  considerable  success  [8]  and  later  for 
liquid  argon  [5].  For  5.305  MeV  -particle,  taking

the fractional energy deposit in the core Tc/T = 0.72 
and the experimental  q = 0.71 in liquid  argon, Eq. 
(11) is, 

 . 

(15) 

This gives qc = 0.60. For recoil Ar ions, Ts = qc Tc = 
qelT, where T = Eη. Then we have qel = qc = 0.60. The 
total quenching factor in the α-core approximation is 
given as,  

 .   

(16) 

The α-core approximation gives qT = 0.68·qnc for Xe 
recoil ions in liquid xenon [8]. 

IV.2. Diffusion kinetics 

The  details  of  the  calculation  have  been 
described in Ref. 10; therefore, only briefly discussed 
here.  k  and  A  are  defined  differently  in  this  section 
from  the  rest  of  the  paper.  The  diffusion-kinetic 
equations  for  free  (index  1)  and  the  self-trapped 
(index 2) excitons may be expressed as 

(17) 

(18) 

where  n  is  the  exciton  density,  D  is  the  diffusion 
coefficient of the free exciton, k is the specific rate of 
biexcitonic quenching,   is the free exciton lifetime 
against  self-trapping.  A1  is  the  radiative  decay 
constant  for  free  excitons  and  A2  is  that  for  self-
trapped  excitons.  The  diffusion-kinetic  equations 
were solved by the method of “prescribed diffusion”. 
In cylindrical geometry one writes with the Gaussian 
function 

(19) 

where  N(t)  is  the  number  of  free  excitons  per  unit 
length at time t and  

 , 

   (20) 

is  a  normalized  distribution  at  any  time  t.  Eq.  (20) 
provides  the  spread  of  the  special  distribution  by 
diffusion. The initial value for N(t) is given by 

(21) 

where  l  is  the  density  of  the  liquid,  Nex/Ni  is  the 
initial ratio of excitation and ionization, and W is the 
W-value,  an  average  energy  required  to  produce  an 
electron-ion pair. Since accurate values for slow Ar 
ions are not available, we took values of Nex/Ni = 0.21 

[19, 20] and W = 23.6 eV [5] reported for electrons in 
liquid argon. 

to 

The excitons are treated as “free” excitons, that 
particles moving rapidly in condensed argon  with a 
the  electron  mass  [21].  The 
mass  similar 
parameters  used  in  the  calculation  are  basically  the 
same as those described before. The rate constant k is 
given  by  k=v  where  v  is  the  thermal  velocity  of 
collision  partners  (v  =  1.2×107  cm/s)  and    is  the 
cross  section.  The  hard-sphere  cross  section  is  HS 
~170 Å2. We took k = kHS/4 = 5×10-8 cm3/s. The free 
exciton  lifetime    is  taken  to  be  1  psec  and  the 
diffusion  constant  D  =  1  cm2/s  is  used.  The  initial 
radius a0 = 3.9 Å for recoil Ar ions. 

We have ignored the radiative term -A1n1 in Eq. 
(17)  since  the  term  is  orders  of  magnitude  smaller 
than  the  self-trapping  term  -n1/  and  the  radiative 
term -A2n2 in Eq. (18) since  is much shorter than the 
lifetime of light emission. We calculated the number 
N2(∞) of self-trapped excitons per unit length, which 
survived quenching. The fraction N2(∞)/N0 gives qel. 
We  have  calculated  the  number  of  self-trapped 
exciton up to t/=4.  

FIG. 4. The electronic quenching factor for slow 
Ar ions in liquid argon estimated by biexcitonic 
diffusion kinetics (dotted curve) as a function of 
electronic  LET.  The  α  core  approximation 
(dashed line) is also shown. 

Scintillation  efficiency  for  recoil  ions  as  a 
function of energy is needed for WIMP searches. The 
electronic  quenching  factor  qel    has  been  calculated 
and expressed as a function of LETel,  

(22) 

where  LETel  is  in  [MeV·cm2/mg].  This  relation  is 
applicable only to slow ions. The result is as shown 
in Fig. 4. 

Then, the total quenching factor at energy  E is 

obtained by integration,

defined as the ratio of the nuclear recoil scintillation 
response to the relativistic heavy ions, which show no 
reduction due to escaping electrons.  

V. Results  

The result obtained for Ar recoil ions in  liquid 
argon  is  shown  in  Fig.  5  together  with  reported 
experimental  results  [22-27]  as  a  function  of  the 
energy.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  experimental 
values  are  the  scintillation  efficiency,  RN/  ratios 
(Leff), relative to 122 keV (or 59.5 keV) -rays. qT is 
expressed as, 

(24) 

where  Lγ0  is  the  scintillation  efficiency  for  γ-rays 
used as a reference. However, an accurate value for 
Lγ0  is  not  available.  The  scintillation  efficiency  for 
210Po 5.305 MeV -particles Lα = 0.71 [28] and the 
/ ratio of 1.11 for 1 MeV electrons [28] gives Lγ0 
= 0.8. The value is considered to give a lower limit 
since the LET increases as the energy decreases then 
Lγ0 expected to increase. We used Lγ0 = 0.83 by taking 
into  account  small  differences  for  22Na,  133Ba  and 
241Am -rays [27].  

The solid curve shows the nuclear quenching qnc 
taken from Lindhard with k = 0.15. The dashed curve 
is the α-core approximation, qT = qnc·qel, obtained by 
assuming  a  constant  qel  =  0.60  as  discussed  above. 
The  dotted  curve  is  the  present  calculation.  The 
values for α-core approximation increase with energy, 
while present calculation shows relatively constant qT 
values.  qnc  increases  with  energy  increase,  together 
with LETel increase, this in turn increase in N0 which 
make a decrease in qel value. qnc and qel tend to work 
against  to  each  other,  consequently,  give  relatively 
constant qT. 

The present result (the dotted curve) is smaller 
than  the  experimental  values;  however,  reproduces 
the  experimental  energy  dependence  reported  by 
Micro-CLEAN [23] and DARWIN [24] and Creus et 
al.  [26]  that  show  relatively  constant  scintillation 
efficiency above ~20 keV. While, the results obtained 
by SCENE [25] and ARIS [27] were well reproduced 
by the α core approximation. The measurements, as 
well  as  the  theory,  become  extremely  difficult  at  a 
very  low  energy  region.  Experimental  results  are 
scattered and have large errors below ~20 keV.

bars are not shown. 

20 keV then becomes almost flat. Sn peaks at around 
20  keV  then  decreases  with  energy,  while  Se 
contribution  increases  as  E1/2  and  compensates  Sn 
decrease.  Both  Se  and  LETel  increase  with  energy; 
however, the magnitude and increasing rate are quite 
different from each other, particularly at a low energy 
region.  Therefore,  it  is  not  appropriate  to  use  Se  in 
place of LETel as used in most data analysis for recoil 
ions in liquid rare gases.

gaseous argon. Phipps et al. measured  W-values for 
25 - 100 keV Ar ions in argon [29]. The values agreed 
with  Eq.  (7)  expected  by  Lindhard  theory  within 
~12 %. A simplification in taking k = 0.15, instead of 
k = 0.145, overestimates   values about 3 %. Then 
the  agreement  becomes  within  ~10  %..  Platzman’s 
energy balance equation relates the W-value and the 
Nex/Ni ratio [30],

electrons. The agreement mentioned above supports 
the assumption that the  Nex/Ni ratio for slow ions is 
the same as that for fast ions (0.21 for liquid argon).  
The present calculation gives relatively small qT 
values  compared  with  experiments.  The  main 
uncertainty 
the 
experiments is due to Lγ0 value, 0.83 with +0.12/-0.05. 
Some measurements assume Lγ0 =1 in analyzing data. 
The measurement of S1 signal at zero fields requires 
some cautions. The observation time has to be long 
enough. Even the stray field from PMT influences the 
scintillation measurements for γ-rays.

theory  and 

the 

The  values  for  the  track  and  collision-reaction 
parameters  used  in  the  calculation  were  taken  from 
the  literature  and/or  estimated  with  reasonable 
consideration  [10].  Uncertainties  originated  from 
those parameters were discussed in detail in Ref. 10. 
The  quenching  cross  section    is  the  adjustable 
parameter  in  present  calculation.  As  mentioned 
above, HS/4 is obtained by using an averaged <LETel > 
for various particles [10]. The previous study showed 
that  HS/4  can  be  regarded  as  an  upper  limit.  The 
agreement  with  the  experimental  results  may  be 
improved by taking a smaller  that is still reasonable.  
The  shape  of  each  recoil-ion-track  changes 
because  of  the  scattering.  The  track  is  short  and 
detours and may have some branches. The struggling 
is also large. The present calculation for qel ignored 
these influences for the simplicity. 

VI.2. Field effects 

Since the electric field does not influence on the 
stopping  process  (consequently  not  on  both qnc  and 
the Nex/Ni ratio), we refer the energy as that given to 
the  electronic  excitation  Eη  (T  in  Chapt.  III)  in  this 
section unless otherwise mentioned. The scintillation 
and  ionization  yields  are  complementary  to  each 
other. An appropriate summation of the scintillation 
and  charge  yields  gives  the  energy  [28].  Some 
measurements  of  the  response  to  incident  particles 
observed S1 in the absence of the external field [23, 
24] while others measured the sum signal, S1 and S2,

Measurements in wide range of the field is necessary 
to extract the Nex/Ni ratio and χ. Deviation from Eq. 
(29)  at  a  low  field  have  been  reported  for  1  MeV 
electron [28]. Eq. (29) at Q = 0 is the invers of Lγ0, 
Eq.  (27).    Lγ0  is  basically  given  by  S10/S1int,  where 
S1int is the intercept of the S1-S2 plot on zero S2, the 
S1 axis. We obtain Lγ0 ~ 0.9 for 85mKr γ-rays (10 keV 
+  31  keV)  in  liquid  argon  from  ref.  [25].  In  liquid 
xenon, Lγ0 = 0.77 was use in Ref. [8]; however, the 
S1-S2  plot  reported  afterwards  gave  Lγ0  =  0.89  for 
122 keV electrons [32]. 

At a high LET region, escaping electrons may be 
negligible.  A  charge  increase  is  associated  with  a 
scintillation decrease. When the absolute number of 
photons  emitted  nph  and  electrons  collected  ni  are 
obtained,  the  sum  nph  +  ni  gives  the  energy  and  is 
expressed as [31]

where suffix 0 indicates at zero field. Otherwise, the 
energy is given by qelT with the quenching factor qel 
expressed as [31] 

 .  

(32) 

Then, the energy is obtained by the charge ratio Q/Q∞ 
and the scintillation ratio S1/S10 when qel0 is available. 
A factor 1+Nex/Ni appearing in Eq. (31) is due to the 
fact that the average energy required to produce one 
photon and one electron-ion pair is 19.6 eV and 23.6 
eV  for  liquid  argon,  respectively,  and  are  not  the 
same. The measurement obtains qT = Leff·Lγ0 = qnc·qel 
and  cannot  separate  qnc  and  qel.  Then,  Eq.  (32)  is

VI.3. General remarks  

The measurement in liquid phase can obtain qT; 
however, it is quite difficult to separate contributions 
from nuclear quenching and electronic quenching for 
slow recoil ions. The W-value measurements in gas 
phase should be performed to obtain experimental qnc 
[39]. The numbers of photons and ion pairs produced 
are quite limited, the statistics obtained is not enough 
in most cases. The parameters should be carefully set, 
otherwise  the  fitting  procedure  can  lead  to  an 
improper  behavior  of  physical  quantity  and  may 
result  in  a  wrong  conclusion.  The  recombination 
process in a dense plasma is complex and needs much 
more detailed investigation.  

LETel  has  wide  usage.  Scintillation  yield  for 
recoil ions in inorganic crystals can be estimated by 
comparing response at the LETel for slow ions with 
LET for fast ions [40]. 

ion  collisions  based  on, 

Lindhard has pointed out that the Thomas-Fermi 
treatment,  which  the  stopping  power  theories  for 
heavy 
is  a  crude 
approximation at very low energy [11]. “The energy 
loss to electrons is actually correlated to the nuclear 
collisions,  and  in  close  collisions  considerable 
ionization will take place.”  The distinction between 

7 

scattering and electronic excitation, Eq. (1), becomes 
a  blur.  Full  quantum  mechanical  calculations 
including  the  molecular  orbit  (MO)  theory  [41]  is 
required. Also, elaborated measurements [42] should 
be extended to incorporate large scattering angle. 

We  recommended  that  terms  and  nomenclature 
follow  custom  in  radiation  physics  and  radiation 
chemistry,  otherwise,  the  knowledge  accumulated 
over  decades  would  be  overlooked,  apart  from 
confusions wrong usage of terms may cause. 

VII. Summary 

The scintillation yields due to Ar ions recoiled by 
WIMPs in liquid argon has been evaluated. Nuclear 
quenching  was  obtained  by  Lindhard  theory.  A 
calculation  was 
biexcitonic  diffusion-reaction 
performed  for  electronic  quenching.  A  cylindrical 
track  structure  was  considered.  The  electronic  LET 
was used to obtain the excitation density needed for 
the calculation. The present theory gives lower limit 
for  the  quenching  factor  with  a  quenching  cross 
section of a quarter that the hard-sphere cross section. 
Most  experimental  results  fall  between  the  present 
model  and  a  simple  α-core  approximation  within 
errors.  The  main  uncertainty  for  comparing  the 
theory  and  the  experiments  is  due  to  a  lack  of 
accurate scintillation efficiency for low energy γ-rays. 
The use of the S1-S2 plot is proposed. Some problems 
in  analyzing  experimental  data  with  and  without 
external field were discussed.

W-value   

W = E/Ni     

The average energy expended to produce an electron-ion pair. Ionizations of all generation are 
included in the definition of W, which is therefore a gross average. It should not be confused with the 
work function. Wph is defined as the average energy expended to produce one photon. 

the work function is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from a solid to a point in the 

vacuum outside the solid surface. a property of the surface of the material.

Nex/Ni   

(Nex and Ni are the initial number of excitons and e-ions pairs, respectively, 
  produced by incident particle.) 

can depend on particles and energy. However, Nex/Ni = 1 for recoil ions sounds too large. Bookkeeping, 
like Eqs. (26)–(32) in present paper, should be done properly. Some refers ref. [36] for Nex/Ni = 1, 
however, the paper reads “the ratio of aS0 to Nex + Ni should be unity”. While, “the mean energy for 
an ionization is approximately equal to the mean energy for an ionization, which means that Nex/Ni ≈ 
1.” No, it doesn’t mean that. The ratio is determined by the oscillator strength [A1]. It implies however, 
together with the triplet state is not ‘real triplet’ in Ar and Xe, the Nex/Ni ratio does not depend strongly 
on the kind of particles and the energy.   

Stopping power and LET (linear energy transfer)   

When you say stopping power, you are on the incident particle, you don’t care what secondary 
particles you kicked out do afterwards. When you say LET, you are in the target material, gather every 
secondary particle. They are the same for fast ions. 

Birks’s Law   

an empirical formula for the scintillation yield per path length as a function of the stopping power for 
organic scintillators, which do not have escaping electrons. it gives large scintillation yield at low LET 
and  small  yield  at  high  LET.  The  scintillation  mechanism  is  complicated  in  organic  scintillator 
therefore an empirical formula is useful. Formula on the right is obtained that in the limiting cases, 
dL/dE = 1 for dE/dx → 0 and dL/dE = 0 for dE/dx → ∞. Often, the averaged values <dL/dE> and 
<dE/dx> are used in place of dL/dE and dE/dx, respectively. It is applicable to inorganic scintillators 
in the high LET region. If you ever want to use Birk’s law for recoil ions, dE/dx should be replaced 
by LETel since quenching is electronic process. The electronic stopping power (dE/dx)e does not give 
the number of excited species (including ions) par path length, see Fig. 1. 

Thermalization time τth and thermalization length Rth . 

The electron has to lose its kinetic energy before recombination. The elastic scattering brings the 
energy down to ~ 1 eV quickly. Below ~ 1 eV the elastic scattering becomes inefficient. Condensed 
Ar  and  Xe do not have  efficient energy-loss  mechanisms  such  as through  molecular  vibration  and 
rotation. As a result, τth in liquid Ar and Xe are exceptionally long, ~ ns [A2]. The scintillation time 
profile shows this in the rise time for electrons [18]. During the thermalization process, the ionized

2 

electron can travel far from the parent ion. The thermalization distance Rth becomes longer than the 
Onsager radius and the average ion distance. The saturation curve, the fraction of charge collected as 
a function of the electric field, for 1 MeV electron, is different from that for isolated ion pairs [A3]. 
The Onsager theory is inapplicable to even for minimum ionizing particles in LAr and LXe.   

However,  the  rise  time  due  to  α-particles  and  fission  fragments  is  quick  [18];  the  electron 
recombines much faster than τth. The recombination and charge collection have to be treated separately 
for recoil ions and γ-rays. 

Recombination theory 
gives the saturation curve, the fraction of charge collected Q/Q∞, where Q∞=Ni, (e=1) as a function of 
the  electric  field.  No  proper  theories  are  available  for  condensed  rare  gases.  The  data  should  be 
collected such that Q comes near to saturate to obtain useful values for parameters and  Q∞ when a 
fitting function is used. Required electric field F for γ-rays may be ~12 kV/cm and ~6 kV/cm or more 
for  LAr  and  LXe,  respectively.  The  condition  never  achieved  for  α-particles  and  recoil  ions,  data 
obtained for γ-rays may be used for the charge calibration. A small ionization chamber with windows 
for PMT may be used.   

Thomas-Imel Box model 
      This phenomenological model has originally been applied to ~1 MeV electrons since Onsager’s 
geminate  theory  is  inapplicable  to  LAr  and  LXe.  The  box  model  assumes  that  the  e-ion  pairs  are 
isolated and uniformly populated in a box, and the positive ion mobility is orders of magnitude smaller 
than the electron mobility. I-T does not fit for alphas. Later, a double charge-density model consists 
of, the minimum ionization part and the high-density part near the end of δ-track, is proposed to explain 
the fact that the measured energy resolution is much larger than that expected from Poisson statics.   
T-I gives a convenient fitting form.   

Penning ionization 

R* + M → R + M+ + e-   

When the excitation potential of R* is higher than the ionization potential of M, R* can ionize M by 
collision. Penning ionization occurs in mixture. The measurement of Penning ionization Ar* + Xe → 
Ar + Xe+ + e- in liquid Ar-Xe mixture gave Nex/Ni = 0.21 for LAr [19].

The stopping power theory 
Many theories have been proposed to refine or replace the Lindhar theory for slow ion stopping powers.   
Some uses more realistic potential such as Molière and Lenz-Jensen instead of the Thomas-Fermi 
potential.  However,  “the  scattering  is  only  quasi-elastic  and  cannot  in  detail  be  described  by  a 
potential between two heavy centres.” Also, the ion and atom do not come close to each other in those 
potentials  at  very  low  energy.“…  at  extremely  low  ε-values,  ε  <  10-2,  the  nuclear  scattering  and 
stopping  becomes  somewhat  uncertain  [11].”  In  this  aspect,  those  theories  are  no  better  than  the 
Lindhard theory at very low energy.   

BK model [A4] 
takes a dielectric-response approximation as the LS theory [14]. BK consider an electron gas that is 
suited for metal and discus the effective charge of projectile. The stopping power for heavy ions uses 
a scaling rule, S = (ζZ1)2Sp, where ζZ1 is the effective charge and Sp is the stopping power for protons.   

Effective charge 
is determined by the velocities of incident ion and the valence electrons in medium. The effective 
charge in the Thomas-Fermi model is included in the LS theory as discussed in Ref. [17] and references 
therein.   

The nuclear quenching factor qnc (the Lindhard factor) 

The stopping powers contain only a part of the necessary information to obtain qnc = /. Lindard 
et al. [7] solved the integral equation and gave numerical results for the nuclear quenching factors. For 
most cases k is 0.1-0.2, e.g., 0.139, 0.145 and 0.166, respectively, for Ne-Ne, Ar-Ar and Xe-Xe. It does 
not mean their calculation have such a large uncertainty. The value given by k = 0.110 [Hitachi] as 
often quoted is the total quenching factor qT = qnc ·qel. qT = qnc·0.68 gives values close to qnc for k = 
0.110 and qnc and qel are difficult to separate [A5].   

A relation, 

  does not give qnc.   

The difference is obvious when compare the values with the Lindhard values [2] using Fig. 1, they are 
far off. A modification aSe/Sn, where a is a constant, makes even worse. The integral equations have 
to be solved to obtain qnc when stopping theories are introduced.   
The W-value measurements in gas phase give most reliable information on qnc. 

Data analysis 

The scintillation yield as a function of energy and the charge yield as a function of the field are 
usually a simple function. Models with a few free parameters can fit the results. However, that does 
not necessarily mean the model or the theory is correct. The measured value should be obtained  by 
model-independent way as much as possible. After the values are obtained, a theory or model may be 
used to interpolate values and/or to compare that results with ‘theory’. “XXX” theory or “YYY” model 
has  assumptions  and  a  region  where  the  theory  can  be  applied.  That  should  be  respected.  Some 
constant never be a “free” parameter. A careless modification can end up with a fitting function merely 
looks like “XXX” theory or “YYY” model.
