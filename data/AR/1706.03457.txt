A graphene sheet partially covered with a bulk superconductor serves as a normal conductor–
superconductor (NS) junction, in which electron transport is mainly governed by Andreev reﬂection (AR).
As excess carriers induced over the covered region penetrate into the uncovered region over a screening
length, the charge neutrality point (CNP) in the uncovered region shifts only near the NS interface. We
theoretically study the electron transport in a bilayer graphene junction taking account of such spatial vari-
ation of the CNP in the electron-doped case. When the Fermi level is close to the CNP away from the NS
interface, the AR takes place in a specular manner owing to the diﬀraction of a reﬂected hole occurring at a
pn junction, which is naturally formed in the uncovered region. It is shown that the diﬀerential conductance
shows an unusual asymmetric behavior as a function of bias voltage under the inﬂuence of the pn junction.
It is also shown that, if the Fermi level is located below the CNP, the pn junction gives rise to quasi-bound
states near the NS interface, leading to the appearance of resonant peaks in the diﬀerential conductance.

Introduction

A normal conductor–superconductor (NS) junction
of graphene can be fabricated by partially covering a
graphene sheet with a bulk superconductor,1–7) where
the covered and uncovered regions respectively corre-
spond to S and N electrodes. It has been suggested that
an NS junction of graphene shows an anomalous feature
in the quasiparticle scattering process at an NS interface,
which cannot be observed in an ordinary NS junction
composed by connecting a normal metal with a super-
conductor.

Let us consider the case where an electron is incident
to the NS interface from the N side and its energy E
measured from the Fermi level EF is in the subgap re-
gion of
< ∆0 with ∆0 being the pair potential. Owing
to the presence of the energy gap, an incident electron is
reﬂected back as either an electron or a hole. The ordi-
nary reﬂection process from an electron to an electron is
called normal reﬂection (NR). The oﬀ-diagonal scatter-
ing process from an electron to a hole is called Andreev
reﬂection (AR),8) which dominates the transport prop-
erties of quasiparticles.9, 10) In an ordinary NS junction,
a reﬂected hole traces back the path of an incident elec-
tron (i.e., retroreﬂection). This feature stems from the
fact that both an incident electron and a reﬂected hole
are in the conduction band. Contrastingly, in a graphene
NS junction, an incident electron in the conduction band
can be reﬂected back as a hole in the valence band if EF is
close to the charge neutrality point (CNP), which is set to

an incident electron is reﬂected as a hole in a specular
manner.11) This phenomenon called specular AR has at-
tracted signiﬁcant attention from both experimentalists
and theorists. However, it has not been clearly observed
in an experiment. A central reason for this is that its
experimental detection necessitates an extremely clean
sample with almost no potential ﬂuctuations to satisfy
∆0 > E >
. This condition requires that potential
ﬂuctuations δEF in space must be much smaller than ∆0.
Recently, a high-quality graphene sheet has been re-
alized by supporting it with hexagonal boron nitride.12)
Indeed, a sample with δEF ∼
5 meV has been reported in
Ref. 13. Using a proximity system of such a high-quality
bilayer graphene sheet, Efetov et al.14) have experimen-
tally studied the diﬀerential conductance in a graphene
NS junction. Here, bilayer graphene rather than mono-
layer graphene is utilized as δEF is smaller in the former
than in the latter. They observed suppression of the dif-
ferential conductance in the subgap region when EF is
tuned close to the CNP, and claimed that this suppres-
sion is a characteristic feature of specular AR. However,
in order to solidly conﬁrm their conclusion, we need to
resolve problems that remain to be clariﬁed.

Previous theoretical analyses on an NS junction of
bilayer graphene14–16) assumed that the CNP varies
in a stepwise manner across the interface between the
covered and uncovered regions (i.e., piecewise position-
independent) [see Fig. 1(a)]. However, the CNP near the
NS interface should be position-dependent, particularly
in the uncovered region, reﬂecting the inhomogeneity of

the carrier concentration [see Fig. 1(b)]. Indeed, excess
carriers are induced over the covered region of x > L
from a superconductor and then inevitably penetrate
into the uncovered region of x < L up to a screening
length λ from the NS interface.17) Thus, we expect that,
in the electron (hole)-doped case, the CNP in the uncov-
ered region signiﬁcantly shifts in the downward (upward)
direction near the NS interface over λ and gradually ap-
proaches the asymptotic value, being set equal to zero,
with increasing distance from the NS interface. It is im-
portant to examine the eﬀect of such spatial variation of
the CNP.

≤

In this paper, we numerically calculate the diﬀeren-
tial conductance of a graphene junction in the presence
of spatial variation of the CNP by using a tight-binding
model. Considering the status of experimental eﬀorts in
this ﬁeld, we focus on NS junctions composed of bilayer
graphene. In particular, our attention is directed to the
electron-doped case where EF in the covered region is lo-
cated far enough above the CNP while EF in the uncov-
ered region is close to the CNP in the asymptotic region
0 far away from the NS interface [see Fig. 1(b)]. In
of x
this setup, the AR takes place as ordinary retroreﬂection
since an electron and a hole in the conduction band are
involved in the AR process near the NS interface. De-
spite this, the AR can be viewed as specular reﬂection
if observed in the asymptotic region. This is attributed
to the diﬀraction of a reﬂected hole due to a smooth pn
junction,18, 19) which is naturally formed in the uncov-
ered region. It is shown that the diﬀerential conductance
shows an unusual asymmetric behavior as a function of
bias voltage under the inﬂuence of the pn junction. It
is also shown that, if EF is located below the CNP, res-
onant peaks appear in the diﬀerential conductance, re-
ﬂecting the presence of quasi-bound states created by the
pn junction together with the NS interface.

In the next section, we introduce a tight-binding model
for the bilayer graphene junction and brieﬂy describe a
numerical method to calculate the diﬀerential conduc-
tance of the junction. In Sect. 3, we present the numeri-
cal results of the diﬀerential conductance for several sets
of parameters and explain their characteristics. The last
section is devoted to a summary and discussion. Diﬀer-
ences between this study and that of Ref. 15 are brieﬂy
discussed with an emphasis on the role of λ. We set ~ = 1
throughout this paper.

2. Tight-Binding Model

We consider a bilayer graphene sheet of width W that
is inﬁnitely long in the x-direction, where the covered
region of x > L corresponds to the S electrode and the
uncovered region of x < L corresponds to the N elec-
trode. For simplicity, we assume that the potential V (x)
determining the location of the CNP is given by

Let us introduce a pair of vertically coupled hexago-
nal lattices, as shown in Fig. 1(c), on which a bilayer
graphene is implemented within a tight-binding approxi-
mation.21–23) A unit cell consists of two diﬀerent columns
containing four lattice sites: a pair of A and B sublattice
sites in the top and bottom layers. We designate them as
the α and β columns; thus, each column in this lattice
system is speciﬁed by this index together with the num-
ber j of the unit cell (i.e., jα or jβ). The coordinate x of
the jα (jβ) column is given by x = aj [x = a(j + 1/2)]
with a being the lattice constant. Now, let us introduce
the vector of wave functions in the jζ column (ζ = α or
β) as

ber of conducting channels in each valley and TNS rep-
resents the angle-averaged dimensionless conductance,
which reaches its maximum value of 2 when the AR prob-
ability becomes 1 (i.e., perfect AR) regardless of φ. The
factor of 1/2 in the expression for TNS is included to pick
up the contribution from a single valley. Although the
physical meaning of TNS is transparent, it cannot fully
capture the V dependence of GNS. Thus, we mainly con-
sider gNS deﬁned by

gNS(EF + eV ) = kF(EF + eV )aTNS(EF + eV ),

(19)

in terms of which the diﬀerential conductance is ex-
pressed as

This indicates that gNS can be regarded as the dimen-
sionless conductance per unit width. For reference, we
also introduce gN(EF + eV ) and TN(EF + eV ), each of
which represents the corresponding dimensionless con-
ductance in the normal state (i.e., ∆0 = 0).

and B

Here, A and B respectively represent the A and B sub-
lattice sites in the top layer while A
respectively
represent those in the bottom layer. Using a simple tight-
binding approximation, we describe electrons in bilayer
graphene in terms of transfer integrals γ0 and γ1, which
respectively represent the in-plane hopping of an elec-
tron between nearest-neighbor sites in each layer and the
vertical hopping of an electron between nearest-neighbor
sites in the top and bottom layers. This approximation
ignores the eﬀect of trigonal warping, which is not ex-
pected to signiﬁcantly aﬀect AR processes. Under the
periodic boundary condition in the y-direction, quasi-
particle wave functions in the corresponding direction
are described by a wave number q. In terms of the vector
of wave functions deﬁned in Eq. (3), the Bogoliubov–de

In this section, we present the numerical results of gNS,
as well as those of gN, TNS, and TN for reference, as a
function of eV for several values of EF in the low-energy

junction is characterized by the following parameters: γ0,
γ1, ∆0, U0, and λ. The transfer integrals are given by
γ0 = 3.16 eV and γ1 = 0.39 eV. Assuming that NbSe2
is deposited on a bilayer graphene sheet as a bulk super-
conductor,14) we set ∆0 = 1.2 meV. The work functions
of NbSe2 and bilayer graphene have been reported to
be ΦNbSe2 = 5.9 eV25) and ΦBG = 4.4 eV.26) Roughly
speaking, their diﬀerence is on the order of 1 eV; thus,
we set U0 = 1.0 eV. A plausible value of λ is not known,
although it is believed to be on the order of 100 nm or
much longer. We consider the case of λ = 100 nm as the
main case as well as the supplementary cases of λ = 0.0,
2.46, 4.92, 40, and 400 nm. Here, λ = 2.46 (4.92) nm
corresponds to λ/a = 10 (20).

We start with the case of λ = 100 nm. Figure 2 shows
gNS(EF + eV ) as a function of eV for EF/∆0 = 4.0,
3.0, and 2.0. The excess conductance due to the AR is
clearly seen in the subgap region of ∆0 > eV >
∆0.
The behavior of gNS is similar to that observed in an
ordinary NS junction composed of a normal metal and
a superconductor. A slightly cusped peak at eV /∆0 =

curvature of trajectories, which arises from the x dependence of

The diﬀraction of an electron with a negative energy is explained
as follows. In the region of x < xpn where the electron is in the
valence band, the group velocity v of a state with k = (kx, ky)
is antiparallel to k, while v is parallel to k in the region of x >
xpn where the electron is in the conduction band. This combined
with the conservation of ky results in the diﬀraction of an electron
trajectory as shown in (b).

gNS(EF + eV ) with eV > ∆0 is much greater than that
with eV <
∆0. As gNS is nearly equal to gN, this asym-
metry is not related to the AR. Indeed, it is caused by a
pn junction naturally formed in the uncovered region [see
Fig. 5(a)]. Let us consider an electron injected in the right
direction from the asymptotic region of x
0. If its en-
ergy E is negative, the electron passes through the cross-
ing point (x = xpn) at which E coincides with the CNP.
This electron is in the valence band on the left-hand side
of the crossing point (i.e., x < xpn) while it moves to the
conduction band on the right-hand side (i.e., x > xpn);
thus, its behavior near the crossing point is equivalent
to that in a smooth pn junction in graphene.18, 19) This
pn junction reduces the transmission probability of an
electron. As a result, the transmission probability of an
incident electron is reduced only when EF + eV < 0.
This accounts for the asymmetry observed above. Note
also that a pn junction causes the diﬀraction of an elec-
tron [see Fig. 5(b)], which is the origin of specular AR
as we discuss below. The eﬀect of a pn junction is most
clearly observed in TN(EF + eV ). Figure 6 shows TN as
well as TNS at EF/∆0 = 0.5, which indicates that the
transmission probability in the normal state is 1 in the
region of EF + eV > 0 while it is signiﬁcantly reduced in
the region of EF + eV < 0.

We turn to the case of EF < 0, in which a multi-
ple peak structure manifests itself for gNS(EF + eV ) as
shown in Fig. 8 for EF/∆0 =
3.0.
This structure is explained as follows. Both the energy

If EF + eV < 0 and EF −
the uncovered region aﬀects both of them [see Fig. 9(a)],
in contrast to the case of ∆0 > EF > 0 where only
one of them is aﬀected. The pn junction plays the role
of a weak barrier for an electron and a hole, creating
a quasiparticle weakly conﬁned between the NS inter-
face and the pn junction. Such a quasi-bound state gives
rise to a resonant peak in the diﬀerential conductance.
In other words, the AR probability is enhanced by the
constructive interference of multiple scattering processes.
Indeed, we observe such peaks in Fig. 8 in the region of
e
. We expect that the spacing be-

tween two neighboring peaks is mainly determined by the
screening length λ over which a quasiparticle is weakly
conﬁned (see the discussion of Fig. 12 given below).

Finally, we examine how the results shown above de-
pend on the screening length λ. Figures 10, 11, and 12
show gNS(EF + eV ) at EF/∆ = 5.0, 0.75, and
4.0, re-
spectively, for λ = 0.0, 2.46, 4.92, 40, 100, and 400 nm.
Figures 10 and 11 demonstrate that the diﬀerential con-
ductance sensitively depends on λ when λ is suﬃciently
small. However, it becomes insensitive to λ when λ is
40 nm or larger. This behavior does not apply to the
4.0, where quasi-bound states play a
case of EF/∆ =
role. Figure 12 demonstrates that gNS(EF + eV ) sensi-
tively depends on λ even when λ is suﬃciently large. In
the case of λ < 40 nm, gNS shows two peaks at the gap
edges, implying that quasi-bound states are not created
near the NS interface. Contrastingly, gNS shows resonant
peaks in the case of λ
40 nm, implying the existence of
quasi-bound states. The spacing between two successive
peaks is reduced with increasing λ, which is consistent
with Eq. (21) given below.

We suppose that quasi-bound states are created between
the NS interface and the pn junction separated by a dis-
tance Λ as shown in Fig. 9(b). Let us consider the case
where an electron with energy EF + E is incident to the
NS interface from the asymptotic regime of x
0. We
expect that its AR probability is enhanced when EF + E
becomes nearly equal to the energy of the quasi-bound
states. Adapting the argument of Ref. 27 to our problem,
the energy of the quasi-bound states is approximately de-
termined by

4. Summary and Discussion

We numerically calculated the diﬀerential conductance
in a proximity junction of bilayer graphene made by par-
tially covering a graphene sheet by a bulk superconduc-
tor. We took account of the spatial variation of the charge
neutrality point (CNP) caused by the inhomogeneity of
the carrier concentration in the uncovered region. It was
shown that, when the Fermi level is located close to
the CNP, the diﬀerential conductance shows an unusual
asymmetric behavior as a function of bias voltage. This
was attributed to a pn junction naturally formed in the
uncovered region. It was also shown that, if the Fermi
level is located below the CNP, resonant peaks appear
in the diﬀerential conductance, reﬂecting the presence of
quasi-bound states created by the pn junction together
with the NS interface. This implies that one can estimate
λ if such a peak structure is experimentally observed.

It is natural to question whether the phenomena men-
tioned above also appear in a monolayer graphene junc-
tion. A plausible answer is yes since a pn junction, which
is essential for their appearance, can also be formed in
it. However, as the transport property of a pn junction
is qualitatively diﬀerent between the monolayer and bi-
layer cases,28) it is unclear how the phenomena in the two
cases resemble or diﬀer from each other. The monolayer
case deserves separate consideration.

Here, we point out diﬀerences between the theoreti-
cal analyses of this study and Ref. 15. The most strik-
ing diﬀerence is that the spatial variation of the CNP in
the uncovered region was explicitly taken into account in
this study while the CNP was assumed to vary in a step-
wise manner across the NS interface in Ref. 15. Hence,
the eﬀects of a pn junction were not incorporated in the
analysis of Ref. 15. Although the result in Sect. 3 in the
case of λ = 0 corresponds to that of Ref. 15, they are not
equivalent in the sense that intervalley scattering was not
incorporated in the eﬀective mass theory of Ref. 15. An-
other diﬀerence concerns the parameter U0, which was
set equal to 1.0 eV (i.e., U0 > γ1) in this study in accor-
dance with the diﬀerence between ΦNbSe2 and ΦBG while
the case of U0 ≪
The numerical results shown in Sect. 3 clearly demon-
strate that the diﬀerential conductance in a bilayer
graphene junction strongly depends on the screening
length λ over which the location of the CNP spatially
varies. This raises a question of whether an analysis based
on the model with λ = 0 correctly describes experimental
results for a graphene junction.

γ1 was mainly considered in Ref. 15.
