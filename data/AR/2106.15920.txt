Abstract. We report on a compact and spectrally intense extreme-ultraviolet (XUV)
source, which is based on high-harmonic generation (HHG) driven by 395 nm pulses.
In order to minimize the XUV virtual source size and to maximize the XUV ﬂux, HHG
is performed several Rayleigh lengths away from the driving laser focal plane in a high-
density gas jet. As a result, a high focused XUV intensity of 5×1013 W/cm2 is achieved,
using a beamline with a length of only two meters and a modest driving laser pulse
energy of 3 mJ. The high XUV intensity is demonstrated by performing a nonlinear
ionization experiment in argon, using an XUV spectrum that is dominated by a single
harmonic at 22 eV. Ion charge states up to Ar3+ are observed, which requires the
absorption of at least four XUV photons. The high XUV intensity and the narrow
bandwidth are ideally suited for a variety of applications including photoelectron
spectroscopy, the coherent control of resonant transitions and the imaging of nanoscale
structures.

Intense narrowband XUV pulses from a compact setup

Ultrashort,

intense extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pulses are used in a growing
number of applications, which include nonlinear multiphoton ionization of atoms [1–
6], molecules [7, 8] and clusters [9–11], second-harmonic generation in thin ﬁlms [12]
and the study of XUV strong-ﬁeld physics [13, 14].
Intense XUV pulses are also
a prerequisite for performing XUV-pump XUV-probe experiments where XUV pulse
durations down to the attosecond regime have already been used [15–17]. While the
study of electron dynamics on these extremely short timescales requires broadband XUV
pulses, intense XUV pulses with a narrower bandwidth are advantageous for a range
of applications including photoelectron spectroscopy [18, 19] and the study of resonant
transitions, e.g. within four-wave mixing [20], superﬂuorescence [21] and the control of
Rabi oscillations [22]. Furthermore, XUV pulses with a narrow bandwidth and a high
spectral intensity are ideally suited for single-shot coherent diﬀractive imaging (CDI) of
nanostructures and nanoscale targets [23–25].

Narrowband intense XUV pulses are available from free-electron laser (FEL)
facilities [26–28], but the limited access and the large size of these facilities can make
experiments very challenging. Alternatively, long high-harmonic generation (HHG)
beamlines with lengths around 10 meters or even longer have been developed for the
generation of intense XUV pulses [4–6, 11, 15, 16, 29, 30].
Intense XUV sources based
on HHG are currently being developed, including the user facilities ELI beamlines in
Prague [31] and ELI-ALPS in Szeged [32]. A disadvantage of these sources is that they
require very powerful laser systems for driving the HHG process, often reaching the
multi-terawatt range. At the same time, these large-scale setups lead to high demands
regarding the laser stability. This can be challenging, especially when considering that
the XUV pulses are typically focused to micrometer or even nanometer spot sizes [33, 34]
and that some of these experiments require attosecond stability. A number of more
compact XUV sources have been reported that were used to study two-photon ionization
and absorption in He, resulting in the generation of singly-charged He ions [35–37].

In state-of-the-art setups devoted to the generation of intense XUV pulses based on
HHG, the focus often lies on maximizing the XUV ﬂux by using powerful driving lasers
and by loosely focusing the driving laser pulses into the HHG medium [4, 5, 32, 38].
Recently, we have used a diﬀerent approach, demonstrating that optimization of the
XUV intensity on target requires a choice of parameters entirely diﬀerent from the
parameters needed to optimize the XUV pulse energy [6]. This approach was based
on using a modest focal distance (≥ 5 m) for the near-infrared (NIR) driving laser,
followed by a long propagation distance of the generated XUV beam. This enables
large demagniﬁcation of the XUV source size and resulted in a high XUV intensity of
7×1014 W/cm2. Using these pulses for multiphoton ionization, charge states up to Ar5+
were observed following the absorption of at least 10 XUV photons. At the same time,
a moderate NIR pulse energy of 11 mJ was used [6]. However, this setup still required
a lot of space, since overall an 18-m-long beamline was used.

An important consideration for the generation of intense XUV pulses is that optical
elements should only be used where absolutely necessary, because these typically suﬀer

Figure 1. Compact intense XUV setup. A violet laser pulse at 395 nm is focused
by a lens with a focal length of 1 m. High harmonics are generated in a gas jet that
is placed several Rayleigh lengths away from the focal plane of the violet laser. As a
result, both the size and the divergence of the generated XUV beam are similar to the
size and the divergence of the driving laser. However, as shown in the zoomed region
in the lower part of the graph, the virtual XUV source size is signiﬁcantly smaller
than the focal size of the violet laser, as a consequence of the shorter wavelength of
the XUV beam. An Al ﬁlter is used to attenuate the violet laser beam. High XUV
intensities are obtained by demagnifying the XUV source size using an XUV focusing
element with a short focal length f . To this end, a spherical B4C-coated mirror with
f = 75 mm is used.

from high reﬂection / transmission losses and / or aberrations. Furthermore, only
modest demagniﬁcation of the XUV source size can be achieved even in complex optical
arrangements, e.g. when three toroidal mirrors are used [39].
Instead, a promising
path is to exploit the inherent properties of the generated XUV pulses. Recently, we
demonstrated that generating high harmonics several Rayleigh lengths away from the
driving laser focus can result in the generation of a large high-harmonic generation
volume and a small virtual XUV source size of only a few micrometers. After refocusing
the XUV pulses, a high XUV intensity of 2 × 1014 W/cm2 was achieved in a compact
setup with a length of only 2 meters [40], enabling triple ionization of argon atoms.
In these experiments the XUV pulses used for the ionization of argon atoms consisted
of four diﬀerent harmonic orders, which made it diﬃcult to understand the ionization
pathways in detail.

Here we demonstrate the generation of intense narrowband XUV pulses in a simple
and compact setup, where high harmonics are generated several Rayleigh lengths away
from the driving laser focus in a short, high-density gas jet. The HHG is driven by the
second harmonic of the fundamental NIR pulses, resulting in a large spectral separation
between the individual harmonic orders. Using an Al ﬁlter to block the driving laser
and a normal-incidence XUV focusing mirror, an XUV pulse dominated by a single
harmonic order at 22 eV is obtained. In the ionization of Ar atoms, Ar2+ and Ar3+
ions are observed, which requires the absorption of at least two and four XUV photons,
respectively.

The concept for generating intense XUV pulses in a compact setup is presented
in Fig. 1. First, NIR pulses centered at 790 nm with an energy of 13 mJ and a
duration of 40 fs [41] were frequency-doubled in a 150-µm-thick beta-barium borate
(BBO) crystal by second-harmonic generation (SHG), resulting in a pulse energy of

3 mJ at 395 nm. Two dichroic mirrors were used to separate the generated violet beam
from the fundamental beam. Next, as shown in Fig. 1, these pulses were focused using
a spherical lens with a focal length of 1 m, resulting in an estimated peak intensity
of 8 × 1015 W/cm2 in the focal plane when no gas was present. High harmonics were
generated in a high-density gas jet produced by a cantilever piezoelectric valve with a
nozzle diameter of 0.5 mm [42] that was placed either before or behind the focal plane
of the violet laser. By generating high harmonics several Rayleigh lengths away from
the focal plane of the violet laser, curved wavefronts are transferred from the driving
laser to the generated XUV beam (see lower graph in Fig. 1). As a consequence, the
violet and the XUV beams are expected to have similar divergences. Due to the shorter
wavelength, however, the XUV virtual source size is signiﬁcantly smaller than the focus
size of the driving laser (see also Ref. [40]). By further demagnifying the virtual XUV
source size using a spherical mirror (coated with B4C) with a short focal length of
75 mm, a high XUV intensity can be achieved using a setup that has a length of only
2 meters. An important advantage of generating harmonics in this scheme is the large
generation volume leading to a comparably high XUV photon ﬂux.

A 100-nm-thick Al ﬁlter was used to block the driving laser, while transmitting XUV
photons with energies higher than about 16 eV. The XUV beam proﬁle was recorded
using a microchannel plate (MCP) / phosphor screen assembly that was placed at a
distance of about 50 cm from the gas jet. For the nonlinear ionization of argon, a
pulsed atomic jet of argon atoms was generated by a second cantilever piezoelectric
valve with a nozzle diameter of 0.5 mm. The central part of the atomic jet was selected
by a skimmer with an oriﬁce diameter of 0.5 mm. Following interaction of the focused
XUV beam with the atomic beam, the generated ions were recorded using a velocity-map
imaging spectrometer (VMIS) [43] that was operated in spatial-map imaging mode [44].
Individual ion traces were separately recorded by gating the detector and changing the
delay of the gating window.

Fig. 2(a) shows the dependence of the obtained HHG yield in Kr using a backing
pressure of 4 bar on the distance between the focal plane of the driving laser and
the gas jet. This curve has a maximum at −1.5 cm, which means that the focus is
located approximately 5 Rayleigh lengths before the gas jet. Under these conditions,
both the XUV beam size at the jet and its divergence are expected to be similar to
the size and the divergence of the driving laser (see Fig. 1 and Ref. [40]). To obtain
information about the width of the gas jet, the dependence of the HHG yield on the
transverse position of the gas jet with respect to the driving laser beam was recorded, as
presented in Fig. 2(b). This curve has a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of about
1 mm. Fig. 2(c) depicts the relative HHG yield as a function of the backing pressure,
which exhibits a steep increase up to about 1 bar. Saturation starts to set in at higher
pressures, and from about 4 bar the HHG yield is almost constant. This is comparable
to our previous results using 800 nm driving pulses, where this behavior was attributed
to reshaping of the fundamental laser and its inﬂuence on phase-matching under these
conditions [40]. The saturation behavior is advantageous, since it makes the HHG

Negative distances correspond to the gas jet being placed behind the driving laser
focus. The laser intensity of the violet beam at the focus when the gas jet is switched

optimization comparably simple and because slightly diﬀerent pressures experienced by
the driving laser across its beam proﬁle have a negligible eﬀect on the spatially dependent
HHG yield. From Fig. 2(c) one can extract that the HHG yield at 2 bar is about 77 % of
the HHG yield at 4 bar. Using this information in combination with the results shown
in Fig. 2(b), we estimate that the region of the gas jet where the yield drops to 77 %
on both sides of the maximum (meaning that the pressure has dropped by a factor of
about 2) spans a width of about 0.75 mm. This represents an estimation of the gas jet
width and is in accordance with expectations, considering that the nozzle diameter of
the gas valve is 0.5 mm and that the exit of the nozzle is placed as close to the laser
beam as possible.

The XUV beam proﬁle recorded at a distance of 50 cm behind the driving laser
focus is presented as an inset in Fig. 3(a). The beam radius at this position is about
3 mm, corresponding to an FWHM divergence of 7 mrad, which is similar to the
divergence of the violet laser and is a direct consequence of performing the HHG process
several Rayleigh lengths away from the focal plane of the driving laser. In Fig. 3(a), a
photoelectron spectrum is shown that was obtained after focusing the XUV beam into
an Ar gas jet. The spectrum is dominated by the contribution from a single harmonic
order with a photon energy of about 22 eV, corresponding to the 7th harmonic of the
violet driving laser (i.e. the 14th harmonic of the NIR laser). For comparison, Fig. 3(b)
shows a photoelectron spectrum obtained for the ionization of Kr, showing that the
contributions from both the 5th and the 9th harmonics are small. The dominance
of a single harmonic order was facilitated by the large spectral separation between
the harmonic orders (≈ 6.3 eV) and by exploiting the ﬁltering characteristics of the
Al ﬁlter (which has a high transmission for photon energies > 16 eV [45]) and the
broadband boron carbide focusing mirror (which has a high reﬂectivity for photon

energies < 25 eV [46]). The XUV pulse energy at the source was approximately 350 nJ,
as measured by an XUV photodiode (AXUV100G, Opto Diode). Taking into account
the transmission through the Al ﬁlter (40 %) and the reﬂectivity of the XUV focusing
mirror (25 %), an XUV pulse energy of 35 nJ is estimated on target. The XUV pulse
duration is estimated as 25 fs, considering that the nonlinear HHG process typically
leads to an XUV pulse duration which is approximately half the driving laser pulses
duration, see e.g. [47, 48]. An XUV pulse duration of 25 fs was also obtained in HHG
simulations when using 800 nm driving pulses [40].

To demonstrate the high intensity of our XUV source, we performed a nonlinear
ionization experiment in Ar atoms. This target was chosen, because it allows a
comparison with other experiments performed at FELs [1, 3] and using intense HHG
sources [4, 6]. To this end, the XUV pulses were focused using a spherical mirror with a
focal length of f = 75 mm. As shown in Fig. 4(a)+(b), both Ar2+ and Ar3+ ions were
generated. The energy required to generate Ar2+ is 43.4 eV, and the energy required to
generate Ar3+ is 84.1 eV [49], meaning that at least two and four XUV photons need
to be absorbed to generate Ar2+ and Ar3+, respectively. In Fig. 4(a)+(b), the spatial
distributions of the diﬀerent ion species are presented as a function of the distance from
the XUV focal plane. These distributions are centered at the XUV focal plane, reﬂecting
the nonlinear nature of the ionization process. The narrower distribution of the Ar3+
ion trace compared to the Ar2+ ion trace is a consequence of the higher order of the
nonlinearity involved in the former case. The spatially resolved ion traces allow us to

determine the relative ion yields at the XUV focal plane, giving an Ar2+ / Ar+ ion yield
ratio of 8 % and an Ar3+ / Ar2+ ion yield ratio of 17 %.

The transversely integrated Ar2+ ion yield shown in Fig. 4(c) (red curve) is used
to estimate the XUV Rayleigh length zR. According to Fig. 4(d), where the Ar2+ yield
is shown as a function of the XUV intensity, the generation of Ar2+ is a two-photon
process. Therefore, the Ar2+ ion yield as a function of the distance z from the XUV
focal plane is proportional to (1+z2/z2
R)−1 [40]. The measured ion distribution is further
inﬂuenced by the spatial resolution of our method, see black curve in Fig. 4(c). The
spatial resolution was estimated by the transverse width of the Ar2+ ion distribution
at the XUV focal plane. After performing a deconvolution, the blue curve is obtained,
which yields a Rayleigh length of 17 µm. This allows us to estimate the XUV beam
waist radius according to w0 = wXU V,mirror(1 + d2
R)−1/2 = (1.3 ± 0.2) µm, where
wXU V,mirror = 6 mm is the estimated XUV beam radius on the focusing mirror and
dXU V = 81 mm is the distance between the mirror and the imaging plane. We note

that an imperfect alignment of the spherical mirror leading to astigmatism might aﬀect
the estimate of w0. Using w0 = 1.3 µm, an XUV peak intensity of 5 × 1013 W/cm2
would be obtained. Our results are thus consistent with previous FEL results reported
at a photon energy of 20 eV, where Ar3+ was the highest charge state at an intensity
of 5 × 1013 W/cm2 [3]. In our previous experiment performed at an 18-m-long HHG
beamline, Ar3+ ions were only observed at intensities of 1 × 1014 W/cm2 and higher [6].
The higher intensity required for the observation of Ar3+ in that experiment can be
attributed to the much shorter XUV pulse duration of about 3 fs in that case [34],
meaning that signiﬁcantly less XUV photons are absorbed before the peak of the XUV

observed at XUV intensities exceeding 1 × 1015 W/cm2 using the intense XUV source
based on HHG reported in Ref. [4]. This result was attributed to the higher degree of
coherence of HHG sources compared to FEL sources, but is not corroborated by the
results reported here.

In summary, we have reported on the generation of intense narrowband XUV pulses
in a compact and simple setup, which is driven by 395 nm pulses with a moderate pulse
energy of 3 mJ. It is straightforward to implement this concept in many laboratories,
since no large laboratories or multi-terawatt laser systems are needed, in contrast to
many state-of-the-art intense XUV sources based on HHG [4–6, 16, 30–32, 38]. Our
results could therefore boost research ﬁelds that require intense XUV pulses such as
XUV strong-ﬁeld physics and coherent diﬀractive imaging of nanoscale particles and
nanostructures, thereby overcoming the challenges experienced in approaches where
several harmonic orders are used [25].
In comparison to setups where a multilayer
XUV mirror is used to select a single harmonic order [23], an advantage of the scheme
presented here is the higher pulse energy that is contained in each harmonic order. By
spectrally tuning either the fundamental laser or the second harmonic, tunable intense
XUV pulses can be obtained and can be used to scan across resonances, similar to the

possible to use the third harmonic for HHG [51], allowing access to diﬀerent harmonic
orders and resulting in an even larger spacing between the individual harmonic orders.
