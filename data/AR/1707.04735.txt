Recent results from NA61/SHINE ∗

Collaboration

Faculty of Physics, Warsaw University of Technology

NA61/SHINE at the CERN SPS is a ﬁxed-target experiment pursuing
a rich physics program including measurements for heavy ion, neutrino and
cosmic ray physics. The main goal of the strong interactions program is
to study the properties of the onset of deconﬁnement and to search for the
signatures of the critical point.

In this contribution the latest NA61/SHINE results on particle spectra
as well as on ﬂuctuations and correlations from p+p, Be+Be, and Ar+Sc
energy scans will be presented. The NA61 measurements will be compared
with world data and with model predictions.

1. Introduction

The NA61/SHINE experiment [1, 2] performs a two dimensional scan in
temperature, T , and baryo-chemical potential µB of the phase diagram of
strongly interacting matter by varying system size and energy of the inter-
action. The program is motivated by the discovery of the onset of decon-
ﬁnement in Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c by the NA49 experiment [3, 4],
and possible location of the critical point in a region of the phase diagram
accessible with energies available at the Super Proton Synchrotron acceler-
ator [5].

NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target experiment located in the North Area
of CERN. It studies hadron+hadron, hadron+ion and ion+ion collisions in
the beam momentum range of 13-158(400)A GeV/c. The detector is based
on ﬁve Time Projection Chambers providing acceptance in the full forward
hemisphere of the center of mass, down to pT = 0. Time of Flight detectors
at the end of the apparatus provide additional particle identiﬁcation. Cen-
trality selection of ion+ion interactions is based on the measurement of the

forward energy which does not bias ﬂuctuation studies crucial in the search
of the critical point.

2. Study of the onset of deconﬁnement

Fig. 1. Left: Transverse mass spectra at mid-rapidity. Right: Rapidity spectra
in Ar+Sc collisions at six beam momenta. A sum of two symmetrically displaced
normal distribution of independent amplitudes was ﬁtted to the distributions.

The spectra of π− were obtained using the so-called h− analysis method
assuming that the majority of negatively charge particles are π− mesons.
The contribution (≈ 10%) of other particles (K−, ¯p) was estimated via the
EPOS 1.99 model and subtracted. Transverse mass spectra at mid-rapidity
at 40 GeV/c in p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb (NA49) [4] interactions are
shown in Fig. 1 (left). The mT spectra are exponential in p+p interactions,
but deviate from this shape for heavier systems. Nevertheless, exponential
functions were ﬁtted in bins of rapidity to all systems in the mT range 0.2 -
0.7 GeV in order to extrapolate to the unmeasured region. Examples of the
obtained rapidity spectra in Ar+Sc collisions at six studied beam momenta
are shown in Fig. 1 (right). A sum of two symmetrically displaced normal
distribution of independent amplitudes was ﬁtted to spectra to calculate
total yields.

Signatures of the onset of deconﬁnement predicted by the Statistical
Model of Early Stage (SMES): kink, step and horn [7] are shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4.
Their energy dependence for heavier systems diﬀers from that in p+p and
Be+Be interactions. The NA61/SHINE results on p+p interactions greatly
improve the quality of the available data. They reveal rapid changes of the
energy dependence in the SPS energy range suggesting that some prop-
erties of hadron production previously attributed to onset of deconﬁne-
ment in heavy ion collisions my alo be present in p+p interactions [8].
NA61/SHINE performs also reference studies for heavier particles. Fig-
ures 5 and 6 show energy dependence of φ production. The φ multiplicity is

(right) depicts the mid-rapidity yields. The best agreement with the data
is shown by the EPOS 1.99 model although the energy dependence is too
steep. Figure 6 demonstrates that the Φ to π ratio is strongly enhanced in
central Pb+Pb [9] in comparison to p+p interactions.

3. Search for the critical point

NA61/SHINE looks for indications of the critical point of strongly in-
teracting matter by searching for non-monotonic dependence of ﬂuctuations
deﬁned by moments higher than the ﬁrst of distributions of event quanti-
ties. As ﬂuctuations are sensitive to the system size and its ﬂuctuations the
following suitable families of quantities were used:

• intensive quantities like ω = V ar[N ]/(cid:104)N (cid:105), Sσ = (cid:104)N 3(cid:105)c/V ar[N ] and
κσ2 = (cid:104)N 4(cid:105)c/V ar[N ] which are independent of system size but sensi-
tive to its ﬂuctuations ((cid:104)N 3(cid:105)c and (cid:104)N 4(cid:105)c are third and fourth cumu-
lant) [12].

• the strongly intensive quantity Σ[PT , N ], which measures ﬂuctuations
of transverse momentum and multiplicity independently of system size
and its ﬂuctuations [13].

Fluctuations can not be corrected for limited acceptance thus comparison
between diﬀerent experiments or even systems is challenging. Results shown
in a given ﬁgure were obtained in the same acceptance which may vary from
one ﬁgure to another.

for p+p and central Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb [5] collisions at 150/158A GeV/c
beam momentum. Results contradict predictions of the Wounded Nucleon
model (WNM) and ideal Boltzmann Grand Canonical Ensemble. Figure 7
(right) shows the energy dependence for p+p and Ar+Sc collisions. Two
dimensional system size and energy dependence of Σ[PT , N ] is shown in
Fig. 8 (left). So far the results did not show non-monotonic dependence
which could be attributed to the critical point. Figure 8 (right) presents the
system size dependence of Σ[PT , N ] measured by NA49 and NA61/SHINE
at 150/158A GeV/c. The results show consistent trends.

Higher order moments of distributions of event quantities are expected
to be more sensitive to the critical point. Figure 9 shows results on net-
charge ﬂuctuations measured by second, third and fourth order moments in
p+p interactions. The obtained results do not agree with the Independent
Particle Production model (Skellam distribution) but are described by the
EPOS 1.99 model.

4. Summary

This contribution focused on recent results from the NA61/SHINE ion
program aiming to study the onset of deconﬁnement and search for the crit-
ical point. Results on particle spectra and ﬂuctuations were shown. More-
over, new φ production measurements in p+p interactions at 40, 80 and
158 GeV/c beam momenta were reported. NA61/SHINE results on ﬂuc-
tuations quantiﬁed by second order moments do not show non-monotonic
behaviour which could be connected to the critical point. Reference mea-
surements of higher order moments in p+p interactions are available. The
two-dimensional scan in energy and system size will be completed in 2018.
As an extension of this program NA61/SHINE plans to measure precisely
open charm and multi-strange hyperon production in 2021−2024.
