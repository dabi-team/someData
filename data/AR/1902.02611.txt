The properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene can be modiﬁed by the presence of cova-
lently bound impurities. Although this can be achieved by introducing chemical additives during synthesis, that often
hinders growth and leads to limited crystallite size and quality. Here, through the simultaneous formation of vacancies
with low-energy argon plasma and the thermal activation of adatom diffusion by laser irradiation, silicon impurities are
incorporated into the lattice of both materials. After an exposure of ∼1 ion/nm2, we ﬁnd Si substitution densities of
0.15 nm−2 in graphene and 0.05 nm−2 in nanotubes, as revealed by atomically resolved scanning transmission electron
microscopy. In good agreement with predictions of Ar irradiation effects in SWCNTs, we ﬁnd Si incorporated in both
mono- and divacancies, with ∼2/3 being of the ﬁrst type. Controlled inclusion of impurities in the quasi-1D and 2D
carbon lattices may prove useful for applications such as gas sensing, and a similar approach might also be used to
substitute other elements with migration barriers lower than that of carbon.

nanotubes2
single-walled
(SWCNTs) are among the most studied materials of the
last two decades. Due to the conﬁnement in either one or
two dimensions and the fact that they consist exclusively of
surface atoms, their properties such as electronic transport
and chemical reactivity are highly sensitive to any structural
perturbations.3,4 Covalent
incorporation of foreign atoms
within their lattice has thus been proposed as a viable route to
engineer their properties.5–7

Atomic-scale observations in graphene have shown nitro-
gen8 (N), boron8 (B), phosphorus9 (P), silicon10 (Si) and ger-
manium11 (Ge) either as naturally occurring or substitution-
ally implanted covalent impurities. In SWCNTs, the presence
of N,12,13 B,14 P15,16 and Si15 has been spectroscopically de-
tected in chemically synthesized samples, but no direct trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) evidence of their incor-
poration in the tube walls has been shown. Only for N has
such conclusive evidence been presented by Arenal et al.17
Si impurities have attracted particular recent attention due to
the possibility of manipulating them with the focused elec-
tron beam.18–20 As a route complementary to chemical syn-
thesis, Dyck et al. recently used a 100 kV scanning transmis-
sion electron microscopy (STEM) probe to create vacancies
in graphene, which they then managed to ﬁll with Si by irra-
diating the surrounding amorphous contamination.19

Motivated further by computational predictions of vacancy
formation by argon (Ar) ions by Tolvanen et al.,23 we demon-
strate here the efﬁcient covalent substitution of Si in both
graphene and SWCNTs via an Ar plasma treatment. To al-
low a direct comparison, nanotubes were ﬁrst grown in a
ﬂoating catalyst reactor using ethanol and ferrocene as car-
bon and catalyst precursors24 and deposited on commercially

angular range of 60–200 mrad.

The cleaning was followed by plasma irradiation conducted
in a purpose-built plasma target chamber directly connected to
the Nion microscope via an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) transfer
system (Fig. 1). The argon plasma (pressure 5×10−6 mbar)
was ignited in a microwave cavity on the side of the cham-
ber and accelerated to a ∼50 eV kinetic energy, exposing the
sample to a dose of ∼1 ion/nm2. Chemical cross-linking and
the buildup of amorphous contamination during the experi-
ment was mitigated by concurrently applying ∼100 mW of
laser power to the sample, which presumably simultaneously
helped to mobilize the Si impurity atoms.19 This resulted in
the preservation of large clean areas, but also patched the con-
tamination in small pockets as for example those visible in
Fig. 2c. Although not directly observable, these likely cor-
respond to the positions of the greatest lattice disorder and
therefore the highest chemical reactivity.

Even within the atomically clean areas and regardless of
the laser irradiation, some vacancies especially in graphene
remain unoccupied (Fig. S1). We nevertheless ﬁnd a large
number of covalently bound impurity atoms with a scattering
contrast similar to Si27 (Fig. 2d). To conﬁrm their identity,
we used electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to acquire
the elemental ﬁngerprints of each atom.9,10 Since our focus
was on impurities bound to SWCNTs, we studied the tubes
suspended over the holes in the graphene support (Figure 3a).
The EELS system used here9 consists of a Gatan PEELS 666
spectrometer with an energy dispersion of 0.5 eV/px and an
Andor iXon 897 electron-multiplying camera. A background-
subtracted spectrum recorded from the atom highlighted in

Fig. 3a is given in Fig. 3c, indicating based on the L-edge
shape and onset at ∼99 eV a 4-coordinated Si impurity.10,28.
The spatial distribution of elements can be likewise analyzed
by recording a spectrum from each probe position and by
mapping the corresponding core losses. Using the Si L-edge
intensity (∼99–200 eV, see Fig. 3c), the Si distribution was
mapped and is visible in Fig. 3b, conﬁrming the chemical
identity of the impurity atoms.

We next turn our attention to the structure and abundance
of the Si sites. The two fully saturated substitutions, 3- and
4-coordinated conﬁgurations (Si-C3 and Si-C4, respectively)
have been identiﬁed in graphene.10,28 Our atomic resolution
observations, including those in Figure 4, conﬁrm that both
conﬁgurations are also present in Ar-irradiated SWCNTs. We
observed a total of 61 Si sites in 38 tubes (although the con-
ﬁguration could only be identiﬁed for 51), with ∼63% be-
ing Si-C3 and ∼37% Si-C4. These numbers agree remarkably
well with the computationally projected abundance of single
and double vacancies formed upon ion irradiation at energies
similar to ours.23 We likewise observed a large number of Si
defects in graphene (Supplementary Figure S1), but their rel-
ative abundances were not determined.

Interestingly, regardless of the smaller energy required to
displace C atoms from SWCNTs,29 this was not reﬂected in
the relative impurity density. We studied a total SWCNT sur-
face area of 1200 nm2 that contained the aforementioned 61 Si
atoms, corresponding to an areal density of ∼0.05 nm−2. A
graphene surface area of 1365 nm2 contained more than three
times as many Si impurities, 210 atoms in total, giving a three-

fold areal density of ∼0.15 nm−2. While Si impurities are
commonly found on graphene10,18,28 (although their origin re-
mains unclear), they are not present on SWCNTs such as ours
that have not undergone liquid dispersion. It is thus likely that
to reach the vacancies created on nanotubes, the Si adatoms
are ﬁrst required to migrate over the graphene surface.

To study the migration energetics, we ran density functional
theory (DFT)-based atomistic simulations with the projector-
augmented wave method implemented in the GPAW pack-
age,30 and calculated the binding energies (Eb) and migra-
tion barriers (Em) of Si adatoms on graphene and on a set
of achiral SWCNTs (Table I and Figure 5). We used the
revPBE31 exchange-correlation functional, a dzp basis set,32
and a grid spacing of 0.2 Å. The length of the models for
armchair and zigzag SWCNTs were 12.35 and 12.83 Å, re-
spectively. Graphene was modelled using a 7×7 supercell of
98 atoms. The Brillouin zone was sampled using 8 k-points
in the periodic axial direction for nanotubes and a 6×6×1 k-
point grid for graphene. Migration barriers were obtained with
the climbing-image nudged elastic band method (cNEB).33

The lowest energy conﬁgurations for Si adatoms on both
graphene and nanotubes correspond to the bridge site, i.e.
above a C-C bond. The calculated binding energy on graphene
was 0.34 eV, slightly lower than the previously reported values
(0.44 eV34 and 0.55 eV35). This discrepancy appears to arise
from differences in exchange-correlation functionals, revPBE
vs. PBE36, since with the latter Eb = 0.55 eV was also re-
produced in our calculations. On the surface of nanotubes,
the binding energies depend on the tube diameter, chirality
and adsorption site. For smaller diameter tubes the calculated
Eb values are signiﬁcantly higher than those for graphene,
while converging to the graphene value as the tube diameter
increases. Interestingly, the most reactive C-C bridge never
lies on the tubes’ axis or along their circumference, but is in-
stead diagonal (sites 1 and 2 in Fig. 5). This is different from
C adatoms that have been shown to prefer the circumferential
bridge conﬁguration on armchair tubes.37

The calculated energy barriers (Table I) show that migra-
tion on armchair SWCNTs prefers the direction of the nan-
otube axis. For the (7,7) and (15,15) tubes, migration barriers
along the path 1-2 are only 0.08 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively,
and are therefore very close to the value in graphene (0.06 eV
in our calculations, in excellent agreement with previously re-

ported values of 0.06–0.07 eV).34 By contrast, migration paths
around the circumference have barriers 3–5 times higher and
are therefore much less likely to occur. Migration on zigzag
tubes is less directed. According to cNEB calculations for the
(12,0) tube, migration along the path 1-2 on the tube circum-
ference always occurs via conﬁguration 3. Meanwhile, the Si
adatom jumps between positions that are equivalent to sites 1
and 3 can occur in several directions. The calculated energy
barriers for these jumps are higher than those for migration
along the axis of armchair nanotubes and therefore migration
of Si adatoms on zigzag tubes will be slower.

It is important to note that the Si migration barriers are
much lower than those of C adatoms (0.47 eV on graphene38
and ∼0.6–1.3 eV on 10–15 Å diameter nanotubes37), which
may explain why Si is such a common lattice impurity.10,18.
Since the barriers in larger diameter tubes are further nearly
as low as in graphene, differences in Si migration over the
surface of the two materials do not provide a direct explana-
tion for their differing Si concentrations. The fact that we
observed many fewer residual vacancies in SWCNTs, how-
ever, suggests that C reconstruction in nanotubes is in gen-
eral more efﬁcient. One possible explanation is that endohe-
dral C adatoms (either endemic or sputtered by the Ar ions)
have migration barriers much smaller than those on the outer
wall.37 Since these atoms are unable to escape from the quasi-
one-dimensional tube, each migrating C will rapidly sample
the entire inner surface and recombine with any vacancy it
encounters,39 effectively hindering the incorporation of Si by
reducing the number of available substitution sites.

To summarize, we have used argon ions to create mono-
and divacancies in graphene and single-walled carbon nan-
otubes and demonstrated the substitution of Si impurities
in both materials in respective concentrations of 0.15 nm−2
and 0.05 nm−2. The captured Si bonded in both 3- and 4-
coordinated conﬁgurations, directly identiﬁed using atomi-
cally resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy and
electron energy loss spectroscopy. Finally, our atomistic sim-
ulations show that Si migration is substantially faster than that
of C. Our ﬁndings could enable also other impurities with sim-
ilar migration barriers to be captured in the graphitic lattice in
