Abstract. Precise modeling of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets is essential for neutrino oscillations
experiments. The modeling of the energy of ﬁnal state particles in quasielastic (QE) scattering and res-
onance production on bound nucleons requires knowledge of both the removal energy of the initial state
bound nucleon as well as the average Coulomb and nuclear optical potentials for ﬁnal state leptons and
hadrons. We extract the average values of the real part of the nuclear optical potential for ﬁnal state nu-
cleons (U QE

targets (12

1 Introduction

Precise modeling of neutrino interactions on nuclear tar-
gets is essential for neutrino oscillations experiments [1–
5]. The modeling of the energy of ﬁnal state particles in
quasielastic (QE) scattering and resonance production on
bound nucleons requires knowledge of both the removal
energy of the initial state bound nucleon as well as the
average Coulomb and nuclear optical potentials for ﬁnal
state leptons and hadrons. In this communication we com-
pare the values of the average nuclear optical potential for
ﬁnal state nucleons (U QE
opt ) as a function of the nucleon ki-
netic energy extracted from inclusive electron scattering
data on nuclear targets in the QE region to calculations
based on proton scattering data (on nuclear targets). In
addition, we compare to values of the average nuclear op-
tical potential for a ∆(1232) resonance in the ﬁnal state
(U ∆
opt) extracted from a subset of the inclusive electron
scattering data.

First we summarize some of the results of our previ-
ous publication [6] on removal energies and the average
nuclear optical potential for ﬁnal state nucleons extracted
from inclusive quasielastic (QE) electron scattering data
on a variety of nuclei. The analysis was done within the
framework of the impulse approximation.

The diagrams on the top two panels of Fig. 1 illus-
trate electron QE scattering from an oﬀ-shell bound pro-
ton (left) and neutron (right). The diagrams on the bot-

tom two panels show antineutrino (¯ν) QE scattering from
an oﬀ-shell bound proton producing a ﬁnal state neutron
(left), and neutrino (ν) scattering from an oﬀ shell bound
neutron producing a ﬁnal state proton (right). The elec-
tron scatters from an oﬀ-shell nucleon of momentum pi=k

son of electron and positron inclusive QE diﬀerential cross

tions based on charge distributions of nuclei [8]. In the

ergy (cid:15)P,N ) using spectral functions measured in exclu-
sive electron scattering experiments on nuclear targets in
which both the ﬁnal state electron and proton are detected

version of genie [9]) do not include the eﬀect of the ex-
citation of the spectator nucleus, nor do they include the
eﬀects of the interaction of the ﬁnal state nucleons and
hadrons with the Coulomb [7] and nuclear optical poten-
tials of the nucleus.

We model the eﬀect of the interaction of ﬁnal state nu-
cleons with the real part of the nuclear optical potential
with a parameter U QE
f 3 is the square of the
3-momentum of the ﬁnal state nucleon at the vertex. Al-
ternatively, we also extract U QE
opt (T ) where T is the kinetic
energy of the ﬁnal state nucleon. In the analysis we make
the assumption that U QE
for the proton and neutron are
opt
the same. The parameter U QE
opt (T ) takes into account on
average the eﬀect of the real part of the nuclear optical
potential and results in a modiﬁcation of the energies of
both the ﬁnal state lepton and the ﬁnal state nucleon.

The imaginary part of the optical potential results in
interactions of the ﬁnal state nucleon with nucleons in
the spectator nucleus. These interactions can result in the
knockout of additional nucleons as well as pion produc-
tion. The eﬀect of the imaginary part of the nuclear optical

refer to the optical potential, it is a shorthand for the real

3.1 Comparison of the values of U QE

opt to calculations

The formalism of the nuclear optical potential of Cooper,
Hama, Clark and Mercer [37,38] is phenomenological. They
propose a few parametrizations of the optical potential,
and determine their dependence on the kinetic energy of
the nucleon and radial coordinate by ﬁtting the scattering
solutions to the proton-nucleus data for the elastic cross
sections, analyzing powers, and spin rotation functions for
proton scattering on diﬀerent nuclei. Since electron and
neutrino interactions can occur at any location in the nu-
cleus, it is the average value of the optical potential U QE
opt
over the entire nucleus that is the parameter that is needed
for MC simulations.

The solid blue lines in Figures 3, 4, and 5 are the aver-
age nuclear optical potential for ﬁnal state nucleons U QE
opt
calculated by Jose Manuel Udias [39] using the formalism
of Cooper, Hama, Clark and Mercer published in 1993 [37],
and the dashed blue lines are calculated using the later for-
malism of Cooper, Hama and Clark published in 2009 [38].
As a check, the solid red lines in in Figures 3 and 4
are calculations of U QE
opt by Artur. M. Ankowski [40] using
Cooper 1993 [37] formalism, and the dashed red lines are
calculated using the Cooper 2009 [38] formalism.

4 Average nuclear optical potential for a ∆
resonance in the ﬁnal state

Several theoretical groups model the quasielastic and ∆
production in nuclear targets. The Valencia group [43] uses
a local Fermi gas model with RPA correlations. The model
accounts for medium eﬀects through the use of nucleon-
hole and ∆-hole spectral functions. The Giessen group
uses the GiBUU [41,42] implementation of quantum-kinetic
transport theory to describe the QE and ∆ regions. As
mentioned earlier an ingredient in GiBUU is a momen-
tum dependent potential translated into an eﬀective nu-
cleon mass. A summary of various models can be found in
reference [44].

The top two panels in Fig. 7 show diagrams for elec-
tron scattering from a bound proton producing an invari-
ant mass W in the region of the ∆+(left), and scattering
from a bound neutron producing an invariant mass W in
the region of the ∆0(right). The bottom two panels show
neutrino scattering from a bound neutron producing an
invariant mass W in the region of the ∆+(left) and an-
tineutrino scattering on a bound neutron producing an
invariant mass W in the region of the ∆−(right).

For electron scattering from a bound nucleon the aver-
age optical potentials for QE electron scattering and the
production of an invariant mass W in the region of the ∆
resonance are deﬁned as follows:

In order to extract the average nuclear optical poten-
tial for a ∆ resonance we need to model the cross sec-
tion between the QE peak and the ∆ resonance. We use
the eﬀective spectral function [35] (which includes a 2p2h
contribution) to model the region of the QE peak. In the
calculation of the inelastic cross section for the produc-
tion of resonances and the continuum we use the Bosted-
Christy ﬁts [36] to the inelastic structure functions for free
protons and neutrons in the resonance region and contin-
uum. As described in the Appendix, these are ﬁts a wide
range of inelastic electron scattering data on protons and
deuterons including photoproduction data at Q2 = 0. The
ﬁts describe the inelastic structure functions for protons

(curves from Ref. [41]).

3.2 Discussion of the optical potential for nucleons

We extract the parameter U QE
opt which the average of the
real part of the optical potential for the ﬁnal state nucleon.
This parameter is extracted for use in Monte Carlo gener-
ators for which the initial state nucleon is described by a
spectral function. The spectral function describes the mo-
mentum distribution of the nucleon and its removal energy
and can be measured in exclusive ee(cid:48)P electron scattering
experiments on nuclear targets, Since the nucleon can be
removed from any location in the nucleus, it is the average
optical potential that is the relevant parameter. Since we
use the measured removal energies to describe the initial
state nucleon, the potential which binds the nucleon is not
relevant to our analysis.

The GiBUU [41] model describes the initial state as
a bound nucleon for which the momentum distribution
is related to the local density of nucleons ρ. The nuclear
potential U (ρ, T ) for the initial state nucleon depends on
both the local density and nucleon momentum. The same
density and kinetic energy dependent potential is used for
the initial and ﬁnal state nucleons. Figure 6 shows a com-
parison of the real part of the nucleon optical potential
(U nucleon(r, ρ, T )) versus kinetic energy T at r=0 and nu-
1 for GiBUU 2019 [41] as com-
clear density ρ= 0.16 fm−
pared to the potential parametrized by Cooper 1993 [37]
(curves from Ref. [41]). The two optical potentials are con-
sistent with each other for nucleon kinetic energies be-
tween 0.1 and 0.3 GeV2.

over a wide range of Q2.

The Bosted-Christy ﬁts to the proton and neutron
structure functions are smeared with a relativistic Fermi
gas (RFG) to model the resonance production from nuclei.
When comparing to data, the ∆ average optical potential
is included as a free parameter in the ﬁt. We use a sub-
set of the measured electron scattering cross sections on
nuclei that includes measurements of both QE and reso-
nance production. To extract values of the average nuclear
optical potential for a ∆(1232) resonance in the ﬁnal state
(U ∆
opt) we compare the data to predictions of the sum of
QE and Fermi smeared resonance production cross sec-
tions. In the ﬁts the normalizations of the QE cross sec-
tion, resonance cross sections and U ∆
opt are varied to ﬁt the
data. We only include spectra for which the the inelastic
continuum is small and the ∆ resonance can be clearly
identiﬁed. We do not include high Q2 data because the
Fermi smearing from the continuum and higher mass res-
onances is signiﬁcant and the uncertainty in the determi-
nation of the peak of the ∆ resonance is much larger.

The systematic error in the extracted value of U ∆

opt is
obtained by changing the value of U QE
50%. This
shifts the the location of the QE peak relative to the ∆.
The best values of U ∆
opt are extracted and the diﬀerence in
the two extracted values of U ∆
opt is taken as the systematic
error.

4.2 Discussion of the optical potential for the the ∆
resonance in the ﬁnal state

4.2.1 Comparison to GiBUU

As mentioned earlier, GiBUU describes the initial state as
a nucleon bound in a potential U which depends on both
the local density ρ and momentum. The same density and
momentum dependent potential is used for the initial and
ﬁnal state nucleon.

For the case of the production of the ∆ resonance,
the GiBUU formalism requires a density and momentum
dependent potential for the ∆ resonance in the nucleus.
GiBU U = (2/3) U nucleon
What is used [42] in GiBUU is U ∆
GiBU U .
This is not in agreement with our results which indicate
that U ∆

1.5 U nucleon for 12
The short lifetime of the ∆ (5.63

24 sec) implies
that for the low energy transfers discussed in this paper,
the ∆ decays occur inside the nucleus. Consequently, one
would expect that the optical potential for the ∆ should
reﬂect the sum of the corresponding optical potentials of
the decay nucleon and pion. This is consistent with our
results which show that U ∆ more negative than U QE. .

4.2.2 Eﬀective mass of nucleons and ∆ resonances in the
nuclear medium

Some authors [49] have cast the eﬀect of the nuclear op-
tical potential on the nucleon and ∆(1232) as an energy
dependent change in their eﬀective mass in the nuclear
medium. Under this interpretation, both the nucleon and
the ∆ revert back to their free mass values after leaving
the nucleus. For example, the distribution of the ﬁnal state
mass of the decay particles of ∆ resonances produced in
neutrino-(Propane/Freon) interactions [50] peaks around
1.232 GeV.

At low kinetic energy T, both optical potentials are
negative and therefore can be interpreted as a reduction
in the eﬀective masses of nucleons and ∆ resonances when
produced in a nuclear medium [49]. Additional details are
discussed in the Appendix.

However, as discussed in the next section the eﬀective
mass representation is not the approrpiate representation
for MC generators such as genie and neut.

4.2.3 Structure functions of bound nucleons

In most impulse approximation Monte Carlo generators,
the structure functions of the nucleus are expressed in

terms of a convolution of the nucleon momentum distribu-
tions with the structure functions of bound nucleons. The
structure functions of bound nucleons are identiﬁed with
the structure functions of free nucleons expressed in terms
of Q2 and the ﬁnal state invariant mass W . When the ﬁ-
nal state invariant mass is the the mass of the nucleon, the
free nucleon form factors are used. When the mass of the
ﬁnal state is W , the inelastic free nucleon structure func-
tions for the corresponding W and Q2 are used [46, 47].
Consequently, the interaction of the ﬁnal state of mass W
with the mean ﬁeld of the nucleus expressed in terms of
an average optical potential is more consistent with how
the structure functions of bound nucleons are related to
structure functions of free nucleons in these Monte Carlo
generators,

For electron scattering on a nucleon bound in 12

results imply that the interaction energies for the range
of ﬁnal state baryon kinetic energies between 0.05 and 0.3
GeV vary from 5 to 28 MeV for the nucleon and from 11
to 29 MeV for the ∆.

addition, the two interaction energies as deﬁned by Moniz

As shown above, the interactions energies for the nucleon
and the ∆ are diﬀerent and over the range of ﬁnal state
baryon kinetic energies from 0.05 to 0.3 GeV they change
by about 20 MeV. Using our determinations of the removal
energies and energy dependent optical potentials reduces
the systematic error in the interaction energies for QE-like
events from

20 MeV to

5 MeV.

In reference [6] we estimate that a +20 MeV change
in the interaction energy used in the MC corresponds to a
3 eV2, which is the largest
change in ∆m2

×
contribution to the total systematic error in ∆m2
32. This
estimate is consistent with the estimate of the t2k collab-
oration which reports [51] that “for the statistics of the
2018 data set, a shift of 20 MeV in the binding energy pa-
rameter introduces a bias of 20% for sin2 θ23 and 40% for
∆m2
32 with respect to the size of the systematics errors,
assuming maximal sin2 θ23”. Consequently in neutrino os-
cillations experiments our measurements can reduce the
systematic uncertainty in the reconstruction of the neu-
trino energy primarily in experiments such as T2K and
Hyper-K [3] that infer the energy of the neutrino from the
kinematics of the ﬁnal state lepton.

6 Conclusions

We report on the extraction (from electron scattering data)
of the average nuclear optical potentials for both nucleons
and ∆(1232) resonances in the ﬁnal state as a function of
kinetic energy of the ﬁnal state baryons. The data show
that:

7.1 Bosted-Christy ﬁts to nucleon inelastic structure
functions

In the calculation of the inelastic cross section for the
production of resonances including the continuum we use
the Bosted-Christy ﬁts [36] to the inelastic structure func-
tions for protons and neutrons. These are ﬁts to a wide
range of inelastic electron scattering data on protons and
deuterons including photo-production data at Q2=0. The
ﬁts describe the inelastic structure functions for protons
and neutrons including resonances and continuum over a
wide range of Q2. A comparison of Bosted-Christy ﬁts [36]
to photo-production data on protons and to a few exam-
ples of electron-proton cross sections measured at Jeﬀer-
son Lab are shown in Figure 7.1.

The width of the ∆ produced in photo-production [52]
on free nucleons as well as at very low Q2 electron scatter-
ing on free nucleons is smaller than at larger values of Q2.
This leads to an apparent reduction of the location of the
1.220 GeV at very low
∆ peak in W from 1.232 GeV to
Q2. This change in the width (but keeping the mass of the
∆ at 1.232 GeV) is taken into account in Bosted-Christy
ﬁts [36] that we use to parametrize the electro production
of resonances on free nucleons. Our analysis also includes
the eﬀects of Fermi motion on both the peak location and
width of the ∆ when produced in the nucleus.

7.3 Comparison to the analysis of O’Connell and
Sealock

A previous extraction of the average nucleon and ∆ po-
tentials from electron scattering cross sections on 12
6 C was
published by O’Connell and Sealock [48] in 1990. They
ﬁnd that the potential for the ∆ is more negative than
2.5 U nucleon for
the potential for the nucleon with U ∆
12
6 C. Although qualitatively their conclusions are similar
to ours, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the the
two analyses

≈

As shown in the top panel of Fig. 11 the spectra used
in the analysis of O’Connell and Sealock have much larger
contributions from the continuum than the spectra used
in our analysis. Consequently, we believe that their re-
sults for the average potential for the ∆ resonance should
have an additional model uncertainty. Nonetheless, com-
parisons between their results and our results for the op-
tical potentials for the nucleon and the ∆ are discussed
below,

In the O’Connell and Sealock analysis the nucleon op-
tical potential is used for both the initial state and ﬁnal
state nucleons. A speciﬁc functional form is assumed for
both the nucleon and ∆ nuclear potentials. Equations 2

sequently, for the nucleon they set V nucleon

p2
i = (3/5)K 2
F (T= 15 MeV), which is the average kinetic
energy for a Fermi gas. Therefore, their assumption that
U nucleon(p2

values of the removal energies within an uncertainty of 3
MeV.

opt and U ∆

For comparison, we also ﬁt our values for the average
optical potentials for the nucleon and ∆ to the functional
form given in equation 9. For the nucleon, there is suﬃ-
cient data to extract all of the ﬁt parameters. For the ∆
we set V1 = 85 MeV, for which the potentials for the ∆
and the nucleon cross zero at the same value of kinetic
energy T. Comparison of the O’Connell-Sealock ﬁts for
U QE
6 C to our data are shown in the bot-
tom panel of Fig. 11. Our ﬁts (using the same functional
form U = V0/(1 + p2/p2
0) + V1) are shown as solid lines
and the O’Connell-Sealock ﬁts are shown as dashed lines.
A comparison of the ﬁt parameters extracted in our
analysis, and the parameters from O’Connell and Sealock
are given in Table 2. Note that the O’Connell-Sealock ﬁts
are only valid in the region of p2
f between 0.16 and 1.0
GeV2 (0.08 < T N < 0.43, 0.06 < T ∆ < 0.36). As can be
seen in the bottom panel of Fig. 11 the O’Connell-Sealock
ﬁt for the average potential for the nucleon is in good
agreement with our data.

However, the O’Connell and Sealock ﬁt for the average
potential for the ∆ is much more negative than our data.
And, as mentioned before, the spectra used in the analysis
of O’Connell and Sealock (top panel of Fig. 11) have much
larger contributions from the continuum than the spectra
used in our analysis. Consequently, we believe that their
extractions of the average potential for the ∆ resonance
have additional model uncertainties.
