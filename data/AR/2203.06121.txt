Abstract:  Plasma  activated  medium,  containing  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  and  reactive 

nitrogen species (RNS), has been used for cancer treatment as an indirect treatment method. Here 

we report cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) activated deionized (DI) water using helium (He), argon 

(Ar),  and  nitrogen  (N2)  as  feeding  gas  for  the  cancer  therapy.  Basic  characteristics  of  CAP 

activated DI water with different feeding gases were diagnosed and the effects of three solutions 

on the breast cancer cells and gastric cancer cells were also recorded. Our findings show that DI 

water treated by CAP with He feeding gas has a much stronger effect on apoptosis in precultured 

breast cancer cells and gastric cancer cells. These results are attributed to the higher concentration 

of ROS generated in CAP-activated DI water using He as feeding gas.  

CAP has been utilized in various traditional fields and is being gradually developed into more 

fields due to its unique nature.1 It‚Äôs known for the generation of reactive species (ROS and RNS), 

charged  particles,  electronically  excited atoms,  etc.2-4  Plasma  containing  plenty  of  composition 

leads  to  itself  a  broad  range  of  applications  such  as  environment,  materials,  agriculture, 

semiconductor,  medicine,  and  aerospace.5-13  Among  all  these  fields,  plasma  medicine  is  an 

innovative and emerging interdisciplinary research field that combines plasma physics, chemistry, 

life science, and clinical medicine.14 As the temperature of CAP is close or even lower than room 

1 

 
 
 
temperature, CAP seldom causes thermal damage to the human body and biological tissues. Due 

to the benefits from above, CAP is attracting increasing attention and has been used in sterilization, 

dental treatment,  cosmetology, hemostasis,  anti-inflammation, wound healing, and skin  disease 

treatment.15-18 

CAP has shown successful applications in cancer therapy both in vivo and in vitro, including 

oral cancer, lung carcinoma, throat cancer, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, 

melanoma,  skin  carcinoma,  pancreatic  carcinoma,  colon  carcinoma,  cervical  carcinoma,  and 

bladder carcinoma.19-28 Fridman et al reported the anti-cancer effect of CAP in 2007, promoting 

plasma  medicine  to  a  new  level.29  CAP  tends  to  inhibit  the  growth  of  cancer  cells  rather  than 

homologous normal cells in dozens of cell lines.30,31 CAP treatment can be directly applied to the 

tumor/tissues/cells.  For  example,  Li  et  al  employed  the  surface  dielectric  barrier  discharge  (S-

DBD) to treat the human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.32 In order to expand the application of 

CAP, plasma can be delivered through a tiny tube for cancer therapy due to the inaccessibility of 

conventional CAP devices. Chen et al. delivered CAP through micro-sized tube to glioblastoma, 

which effectively prevented glioblastoma growth both in vitro and in vivo.33,34 In addition, plasma-

activated medium/liquid can be prepared in advance and stored until use for cancer therapy.35,36 

In this work, we designed a plasma device submerged in DI water using He, Ar, and N2 as 

feeding gas (Fig. 1a). The voltage and current of plasma-activated DI water were measured with a 

Tektronix TDS 2024B Oscilloscope. The spectra of plasma-activated DI water were characterized 

by UV-visible-NIR Optical Emission Spectroscopy. The temperature of the plasma solution was 

measured with FLIR Systems Thermal Imaging. The concentrations of ROS and RNS in DI water 

were determined by using a Fluorimetric Hydrogen Peroxide Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MO), and 

the Griess Reagent System (Promega, WI). The cell viability of the human gastric cancer cell line 

2 

 
(NCl-N87) and breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) were monitored with the Cell 

Counting Kit 8 assay (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, MD).

and N2 as feeding gas. 

Fig.  1a  shows  the  CAP  device  submerged  in  DI  water,  which  consists  of  2  electrodes 

assembled with a central powered electrode and a grounded outer electrode wrapped around the 

outside of the quartz tube. The electrodes were connected to the high voltage. Images of plasma-

activated DI water using N2, He, and Ar as carrier gases are shown in Fig.1a. The flow rate for 

each feeding gas is 1.0 L/min. Fig. 1b demonstrates the voltage and current of plasma-activated 

3 

 
 
 
DI water using N2, He, and Ar as carrier gases. The peak-peak voltage, as well as average current, 

of plasma-activated DI water using N2 is much higher than Ar and He.

Fig. 2 shows the optical emission spectrum of plasma-activated DI water using three feeding 

gases  and  the  pH  values  of  plasma-activated  DI  water  using  three  gases.  The  reactive  species 

generated during plasma-activated DI water using He, Ar, and N2 are shown in Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b, 

and Fig. 2c, respectively. The identification of emission lines and bands was performed according 

to  reference.37  Using  N2  as  a  feeding  gas  leads  to  the  formation  of  N2  second-positive  system 
4 

 
 
 
(C3Œ†u-B3Œ†g) with its peaks at 316, 337, and 358 nm, which is higher than Ar and He, especially 

higher than He. For Ar, the intensity of OH peak is higher than peaks of N2 second-positive system, 

similar phenomena  were also observed in  He plasma-activated DI water. Naturally, Ar and He 

lines in the range of 600 to 800 nm were observed. Fig. 2d shows pH values of plasma-activated 

DI water using three feeding gases after 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min, and 30 min. The 

pH values demonstrate time-dependent behavior. At the same treatment time, the pH value of N2 

plasma is the highest, while the pH value of He plasma is the lowest. It is reasonable because N2 

plasma generates the highest intensity of RNS, while it is the lowest for He plasma.

Plasma-activated DI water produces ROS and RNS such as the hydroxyl radical, superoxide, 

singlet oxygen, and nitric oxide.38 In solution, these relatively short-lived ROS/RNS converts to 

relatively long-lived species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrite (NOx), and other uncertain 

species. H2O2 and NOx are known to induce cell proliferation as well as cell death. H2O2 is known 

to induce both apoptosis and necrosis, while NOx can induce cell death via DNA double-strands 

break.39,40 Fig. 3 shows the H2O2 and NO2

- concentrations of plasma-activated DI water using three 

5 

 
 
 
feeding gases after 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 30 min. For H2O2 concentration, He plasma is the 

highest,  while  N2  plasma  is  the  lowest  at  the  same  treatment  time.  For  NO2

-  concentration,  N2 

plasma is the highest, while He plasma is the lowest at the same treatment time. Recall that the 

relatively  highest  OH  peak  was  observed  in  Ar  plasma  (as  shown  in  Fig  2),  however,  its 

concentration of H2O2 is much lower than He plasma. H2O2 formation comes from ‚Ä¢OH reaction 

(‚Ä¢OH + ‚Ä¢OH ‚Üí H2O2).41 For NO2

- formation includes following reactions: 1) N2 + e ‚Üí 2N + e; 2) 

N + O2 ‚Üí NO + O; 3) 4NO + O2 + 2H2O ‚Üí 4NO2

- + 4H+.42,43 The results of Fig. 3 are consistent 

with the results of Fig. 2. In addition, we may get the conclusion that H2O2 and NO2

- affect each 

other and their concentrations are suppressed by each other. 

Plasma-activated DI water was applied to cancer cells and untreated DI water was used as 

control. Fig. 4 shows the cell viability of the human breast cancer cells and gastric cancer cells 

exposed to DI water, He plasma-activated DI water, Ar plasma-activated DI water, and N2 plasma-

activated  DI  water  for  48  hours.  The  cell  viability  of  MDA-MB-231,  MCF-7,  and  NCI-N87 

decreased by approximately 55%, 69%, and 65% compared with DI water when treated with He 

plasma-activated DI water at 30 min, respectively. The cell viability of three cancer cells exhibits 

a time-dependent behavior when treated by He and Ar plasma-activated DI water. For N2 plasma-

activated DI water, the cell viability of three cancer cells decreased firstly, followed by an increase 

as treatment time increased. The strongest effect can be observed in the case of He-feed plasma 

for MCF-87 cells at 30 min treatment. It‚Äôs known that ROS can induce cell death by apoptosis and 

necrosis. Plasma can generate a series of ROS, including Atomic oxygen (O), superoxide (O2

-), 

ozone  (O3),  hydroxyl  radical  (‚Ä¢OH),  singlet  delta  oxygen  (SOD,  O2(1‚àÜùëî)),  hydrogen  peroxide 

(H2O2), and etc.44,45 Several types of ROS has been proved useful on cancer cell death induction.1,33 

For  example,  O3  leads  to  cell  death  via  the  formation  of  biologically  active  ROS  and  RNS  in 

6 

 
aqueous media,46,47 O2(1‚àÜùëî) produces oxidative damage and selectively kills tumor cells,48 and O2

- 

activates mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.49,50 In addition, aquaporins (AQPs) help to facilitate 

the passive diffusion of H2O2, resulting in cell death.33 Overall, the above results suggest that ROS 

plays a major role in the interaction of plasma-activated DI water with three types of cancer cells. 

Fig. 4. The effects of the five solutions: DI water (0 min), and plasma-activated DI water using He (a), Ar (b), and 
N2(c) during 5, 10, 20, and 30 min treatment. Cell relative metabolic activity of the human breast cancer cells (MDA-
MB-231 and MCF-7) and human gastric cancer cells (NCI-N87) were measured at 48-hour incubation. 

In  conclusion,  the  CAP  device  under  DI  water  was  developed  and  the  effect  of  plasma-

activated DI water using Ar, He and N2 as feeding gases on breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 

and MCF-7) and gastric cancer cells (N87) were investigated. He plasma-activated DI water shows 

7 

 
 
 
the  highest  concentration  of  ROS  while  N2  plasma-activated  DI  water  exhibits  the  highest 

concentration of RNS. ROS plays a major role in inducing cell death in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, 

and N87 cancer cells. The He plasma-activated DI water during a 30 min treatment had the most 

significant effect in inducing MCF-7 cancer cell death.,
