The exploration of the QCD phase diagram is the most important task of present heavy ion ex-
periments. In particular, we want to study the phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter
and look for the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. Fluctuations and correlations
in kinematic characteristics and particle yields may help to locate the CP (in analogy to enlarged
ﬂuctuations due to critical opalescence close to a CP in a liquid/gas transition). The strong inter-
actions program of the NA61/SHINE experiment may allow to discover or rule out the existence
of the CP in the Super Proton Synchrotron energy domain. For this purpose we perform a two-

Fluctuations and correlations from NA61/SHINE

Katarzyna Grebieszkow

1. Introduction and motivation

There are two important reasons for studying ﬂuctuations and correlations. First, they may
serve as a signature of the onset of deconﬁnement because close to the phase transition the Equation
of State changes rapidly. This can impact the energy dependence of ﬂuctuations. Second, they
can help to locate the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. This is in analogy to
critical opalescence - enlarged ﬂuctuations close to the CP in a liquid/gas transition. For strongly
interacting matter a maximum of the CP signal is expected when freeze-out happens near the CP.

Within the NA61/SHINE strong interactions program we perform a comprehensive scan in
the whole Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energy range (beam momenta 13A-150/158A GeV/c;
√
sNN = 5.1-16.8/17.3 GeV) with light, intermediate mass and heavy nuclei. So far complete energy
scans (six energies) of p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions have been recorded, as well as selected
energies for Pb+Pb and p+Pb reactions. This year energy scan of p+Pb will be continued and
Xe+La collisions will be recorded for the ﬁrst time. Future large statistics Pb+Pb interactions
are planned to be recorded with a new Vertex Detector for open charm and multi-strange particle
measurement.

The experimental strategy of looking for the critical point is based on a search for non-
monotonic behavior of CP signatures such as ﬂuctuations of transverse momentum, multiplicity,
intermittency, etc. when changing collisions energy and/or size of colliding nuclei.

2. Transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations in p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc

NA61/SHINE uses the strongly intensive measures ∆[PT , N] and Σ[PT , N] to study transverse
momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations [1]. In the Wounded Nucleon Model (WNM) they depend
neither on the number of wounded nucleons (W ) nor on ﬂuctuations of W . In the Grand Canonical
Ensemble they do not depend on volume and volume ﬂuctuations. Moreover, ∆[PT , N] and Σ[PT , N]
have two reference values, namely they are equal to zero in case of no ﬂuctuations and one in case
of independent particle production.

The NA61/SHINE acceptance used in this analysis is described in Ref. [1]. Additionally, due
to poor azimuthal angle acceptance and stronger electron contamination at backward rapidities, we
limited the rapidity acceptance to 0 < yπ < ybeam, where yπ is the rapidity calculated assuming pion
mass, and ybeam is the beam rapidity.

Figure 1 shows the energy dependence of ∆[PT , N] and Σ[PT , N] measured for the 0-5% most
central Ar+Sc collisions; centrality is deﬁned by the energy measured in the projectile spectator
region, with the smallest values corresponding to the most violent (central) collisions. There is no
prominent non-monotonic behavior that can be attributed to a CP. The values of ∆[PT , N] smaller
than 1 and Σ[PT , N] higher than 1 may be due to Bose-Einstein statistics and/or anti-correlation
between event transverse momentum and multiplicity (see Ref. [2] and references therein). The
NA61/SHINE results are not reproduced by the EPOS 1.99 model.

A comparison of preliminary 0-5% most central Ar+Sc results with preliminary inelastic p+p
and 0-5% central Be+Be collisions is presented in Fig. 2 (note that p+p and Be+Be results were
already shown by NA61/SHINE [1, 3] but in a slightly different acceptance). For all systems values
of ∆[PT , N] are smaller than 1 and of Σ[PT , N] are higher than 1. A growing deviation of ∆[PT , N] and

Figure 1: ∆[PT , N] and Σ[PT , N] measures of transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations obtained by
NA61/SHINE for 0-5% most central Ar+Sc collisions at forward rapidity, 0 < yπ < ybeam, and with pT < 1.5 GeV/c for
all charged hadrons (h+ + h−). Only statistical uncertainties are shown. Shaded bands show the EPOS 1.99 model.

Σ[PT , N] from unity (independent particle model) with energy may be due to increasing azimuthal
acceptance (for a given energy azimuthal acceptance for p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc is the same). So
far, there are no prominent structures in the NA61/SHINE data which could be related to the CP.

Figure 2: Top row: ∆[PT , N] and Σ[PT , N] for all charged hadrons (h+ + h−) in inelastic p+p (grey squares), 0-5%
Be+Be (red triangles), and 0-5% Ar+Sc (blue circles) collisions obtained by NA61/SHINE in the rapidity interval 0 <
yπ < ybeam and pT < 1.5 GeV/c. Only statistical uncertainties are shown. Bottom row: similar as top but results for
negatively charged hadrons (h−).

Preliminary NA61/SHINE results have been compared to NA49 data. Figure 3 shows that
NA49 Pb+Pb [4] and NA61/SHINE Ar+Sc results (in the narrower NA49 acceptance [4]) are sim-
ilar. The values of ∆[PT , N] and Σ[PT , N] are now closer to 1 (independent particle model) as
expected for a smaller acceptance.

For the system size dependence of Σ[PT , N] at 150/158A GeV/c (Fig. 4, left) the NA49 [4]
and NA61/SHINE data points show consistent trends. ∆[PT , N] (not shown) is more sensitive to
the width of the centrality interval [2] and points are scattered (see Ref. [5]). So far the analysis

in NA49 was restricted to 1.1 < yπ < 2.6 but in 2017 p+p, C+C and Si+Si data were reanalysed
in the acceptance currently used by NA61/SHINE (0 < yπ < ybeam). As expected, ﬂuctuations
are larger for the larger rapidity interval (Fig. 4, right) and an increase of Σ[PT , N] from p+p to
Ar+Sc/Si+Si can be observed. It is now very important to obtain future NA61/SHINE results in
Xe+La and Pb+Pb to ﬁgure out whether a monotonic or rather non-monotonic (as seen in Fig. 4,
left) dependence will be observed in this larger rapidity window.

similar as left (no Pb+Pb point) but results in 0 < yπ < ybeam. Preliminary NA49 [6] and NA61/SHINE data. For
NA61/SHINE only statistical uncertainties are shown.

3. Multiplicity ﬂuctuations in p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc

Multiplicity ﬂuctuations can be determined using the scaled variance, ω[N], of the multiplicity
distribution (see Ref. [1]). In case of no ﬂuctuations ω[N] equals 0, and it is equal to 1 for the
Poisson multiplicity distribution. The quantity ω[N] is an intensive but not a strongly intensive
measure of ﬂuctuations, thus in the Grand Canonical Ensemble it does not depend on the volume
but depends on volume ﬂuctuations. In order to reduce this effect ω[N] is shown here for very
central collisions, namely 0-0.2% Ar+Sc and 0-1% Be+Be. The NA61/SHINE acceptance used
in this analysis is the same as for transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuctuations (previous
section).

Figure 5 shows that there is no signiﬁcant non-monotonic behavior in the energy dependence
of ω[N]. An increase of ω[N] (for charged hadrons) with energy may reﬂect the increase of ω[Nch]
measured in p+p collisions in full phase-space (KNO scaling, see Ref. [7]). The NA61/SHINE
results for 0-0.2% Ar+Sc are in agreement with the EPOS 1.99 model.

Figure 5: ω[N] measure of multiplicity ﬂuctuations obtained by NA61/SHINE for 0-0.2% central Ar+Sc collisions in
0 < yπ < ybeam and pT < 1.5 GeV/c for all charged (h+ + h−), negatively charged (h−) and positively charged (h+)
hadrons. Only statistical uncertainties are shown. NA61/SHINE data are compared to EPOS 1.99.

A comparison of multiplicity ﬂuctuations for p+p, 0-1% Be+Be and 0-0.2% Ar+Sc is shown in
Fig. 6. For all studied systems there is no non-monotonic dependence of multiplicity ﬂuctuations
with energy. However, a different energy dependence is seen for Be+Be (and p+p) and Ar+Sc
collisions! The EPOS model reproduces Ar+Sc and p+p results and underestimates Be+Be data.

Figures 6 and 7 show an in-
teresting effect. Namely, for neg-
atively charged hadrons (the clean-
est sample) multiplicity ﬂuctua-
tions are larger in p+p and cen-
tral Be+Be than in central Ar+Sc.
Within Wounded Nucleon Model
without W ﬂuctuations ω[N]AA =
ω[N]pp (dotted lines in Fig. 7);
WNM with W ﬂuctuations re-
sults in ω[N]AA > ω[N]pp. Thus
Ar+Sc results show violation of the
in the
Wounded Nucleon Model
ﬂuctuation analysis.
In the Ideal
Boltzmann Grand Canonical En-
semble (IB-GCE) ω[N] = 1 (Poisson) independently of the (ﬁxed) system volume. Thus ω[N]AA <
1 is forbidden in the IB-GCE. However, ω[N] can increase due to resonance decays and Bose-
Einstein correlation effects. On the other hand, a decrease of the values of ω[N] (as seen in Ar+Sc)
may be due to conservation laws [8]. Finally, ω[N] (cid:29) 1, as seen in p+p at 158A GeV/c, can be
understood in statistical models as a result of volume and/or energy ﬂuctuations [9].

4. Higher order moments of net-charge and multiplicity distributions in p+p

Higher order moments of multiplicity distributions (skewness S, kurtosis κ) measure the non-
Gaussian nature of ﬂuctuations and are more sensitive (than the variance σ 2) to ﬂuctuations at a CP
[10, 11]. Moreover, they can be used to test (statistical and dynamical) models (ﬁrst moments do not
allow to distinguish between different types of models; already for second moments ﬂuctuations are
different in string and statistical models). Finally, higher moments of conserved quantum numbers
(i = B, Q, S) allow for direct comparison to theory via susceptibilities (Sσ ≈ χ 3
i /χ 2
i ).
It is worth mentioning that ω, as well as products of higher order moments, Sσ and κσ 2, are
intensive measures of ﬂuctuations.

The scaled variance, ω, and products of higher order moments of multiplicity distributions of
negatively charged hadrons as well as of net-charge distributions measured in inelastic p+p interac-
tions are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. There is no non-monotonic behavior suggesting a CP. Tendencies
of all measures are reproduced by the EPOS 1.99 model but the magnitude of κσ 2[h−] is not re-
produced. Results on net-charge ﬂuctuations do not agree with independent particle production
(Skellam distribution). The collisions of Be+Be and Ar+Sc are planned to be analyzed soon.

5. Summary

In this report preliminary NA61/SHINE results on transverse momentum and multiplicity ﬂuc-
tuations in p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions were presented for the rapidity interval 0 < yπ < ybeam.
So far the energy dependences did not show non-monotonic behavior as might be expected for a
CP. We are waiting for Xe+La and Pb+Pb data.

Preliminary results on multiplicity ﬂuctuations in p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc interactions were
calculated in the same rapidity range. The energy dependences also do not show non-monotonic
behavior as expected for a CP. Different energy dependences are seen for Be+Be and Ar+Sc colli-
sions. Fluctuations in Ar+Sc are smaller than in p+p. Thus the Ar+Sc results cannot be explained
within the Wounded Nucleon Model.

Results on higher order moments of net-charge and multiplicity distributions in p+p collisions
were shown. The trends of all measures are reproduced by EPOS but results on net-charge ﬂuctua-
tions do not agree with independent particle production.

There are many ongoing analyses in NA61/SHINE such as proton intermittency in Be+Be and
Ar+Sc, two-particle correlations in azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity in Be+Be (see NA61/SHINE
talks at CPOD 2017), higher order moments of net-charge in Be+Be, etc. The Pb+Pb data taking
started in 2016 and the full energy scan of Xe+La is scheduled for this year. Stay tuned!
