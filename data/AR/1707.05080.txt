ABSTRACT
Ellerman bombs (EBs) have been widely studied over the past two decades; however, only recently
have counterparts of these events been observed in the quiet-Sun. The aim of this article is to
further understand small-scale quiet-Sun Ellerman-like brightenings (QSEBs) through research into
their spectral signatures, including investigating whether the hot signatures associated with some EBs
are also visible co-spatial to any QSEBs. We combine Hα and Ca II 8542 ˚A line scans at the solar
limb with spectral and imaging data sampled by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS).
Twenty one QSEBs were identiﬁed with average lifetimes, lengths, and widths measured to be around
120 s, 0.63′′, and 0.35′′, respectively. Three of these QSEBs displayed clear repetitive ﬂaring through
their lifetimes, comparable to the behaviour of EBs in Active Regions (ARs). Two QSEBs in this
sample occurred co-spatial with increased emission in SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A and IRIS slit-jaw imager 1400
˚A data, however, these intensity increases were smaller than reported co-spatial to EBs. One QSEB
was also sampled by the IRIS slit during its lifetime, displaying increases in intensity in the Si IV 1393
˚A and Si IV 1403 ˚A cores as well as the C II and Mg II line wings, analogous to IRIS bursts (IBs).
Using RADYN simulations, we are unable to reproduce the observed QSEB Hα and Ca II 8542 ˚A line
proﬁles leaving the question of the temperature stratiﬁcation of QSEBs open. Our results imply that
some QSEBs could be heated to Transition Region temperatures, suggesting that IB proﬁles should
be observed throughout the quiet-Sun.

1. INTRODUCTION
Ellerman bombs (hereafter referred to as EBs) are
small-scale (lengths often below 1′′), short-lived (life-
times below 10 minutes) events which were originally
identiﬁed by Ellerman (1917) as regions of intense bright-
ness in the wings of the Hα line proﬁle. These fea-
tures were named ‘petit points’ by Lyot (1944) and
‘moustaches’ by Severny (1956), before the term ‘EBs’
was coined by McMath et al. (1960). EBs have been
widely observed co-spatial to regions of opposite po-
larity magnetic ﬁeld (see,
for example, Pariat et al.
2004; Watanabe et al. 2011; Reid et al. 2016) and have
been interpreted as the signatures of magnetic re-
connection in the photosphere (e.g., Watanabe et al.
2008; Archontis & Hood 2009; Yang et al. 2016). Un-
til recently, these events had been exclusively observed
within Active Regions (ARs), however, new research
by Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016) has indicated the
presence of EB-like events in the quiet-Sun, named quiet-
Sun Ellerman-like brightenings (QSEBs) to distinguish
these events from EBs themselves.

One of the most puzzling aspects of EBs is their ap-

pearance, or lack of, in a range of spectral lines. Iden-
tiﬁed signatures of these events include increased wing
emission in the Ca II 8542 ˚A (Socas-Navarro et al. 2006),
He I D3, and He I 10830 ˚A (Libbrecht et al. 2016)
proﬁles, as well as enhanced emission in the 1600 ˚A
(Qiu et al. 2000) and 1700 ˚A continua (Vissers et al.
2013, 2015). Both Ellerman (1917) and Rutten et al.
identiﬁed no signatures of EBs in
(2015), however,
the Na I or Mg I b2 lines.
Semi-empirical mod-
elling of a variety of combinations of these lines origi-
nally led to estimates of heating within the local photo-
spheric plasma ranging from ∼ 400-2000 K (see, e.g.,
Kitai 1983; Fang et al. 2006; Berlicki & Heinzel 2014;
Grubecka et al. 2016). Temperature increases of this or-
der were challenged by results obtained through anal-
ysis of Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS;
De Pontieu et al. 2014) data which implied signiﬁcantly
more heating is occurring during the lifetimes of EBs (up
to 8 × 104 K).

The identiﬁcation of small-scale brightening events in
the IRIS Si IV ‘Transition Region’ (TR) lines was accom-
plished by Peter et al. (2014) who observed ‘hot explo-
sions’, with estimated temperatures of 8 × 104 K. These
authors suggested that such IRIS bursts (IBs) could
be evidence of heating within photospheric EBs, which
could not be directly identiﬁed in that work, to tem-
peratures an order of magnitude higher than those pre-
dicted by previous semi-empirical modelling. It should
be noted, however, that such modelling had, until that
point, been conducted under the assumption that EBs
occurred in relatively cool photospheric and chromo-
spheric conditions and had not, therefore, attempted to
account for the high temperatures of IBs. In an indepen-

dent analysis, however, Judge (2015) asserted that these
IRIS features were, instead, formed in the chromosphere
or above. Links between at least a sub-set of EBs and
IBs were established by Vissers et al. (2015), Kim et al.
(2015), and Tian et al. (2016) appearing to support the
assertion that it is photospheric plasma contained within
EBs that reaches TR temperatures. It should be noted,
though, that recent work by Rutten (2016), who assumed
that the visibility of EBs could be explained by LTE
modelling, has suggested that temperatures as low as
2 × 104 K could account for the observed increased emis-
sion in the Si IV line.

With relation to QSEBs, Rouppe van der Voort et al.
(2016) found no evidence of emission signatures in Ca II
8542 ˚A data, Si IV images (sampled by IRIS), or the
1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A continuum,
indicating that these
events could be formed at lower temperatures or physi-
cal heights than their AR cousins. The observed lengths
and lifetimes of these events were also smaller than those
found for AR EBs in the literature (see, for example,
Watanabe et al. 2011; Vissers et al. 2013; Nelson et al.
2015) leading these authors to suggest that QSEBs were
a ‘weaker member’ of the small-scale, reconnection driven
family of events in the lower solar atmosphere, possibly
consistent with the modelling attempts of Nelson et al.
(2013). Notably though, Rouppe van der Voort et al.
(2016) only studied slit-jaw images from IRIS, and a de-
tailed analysis of the spectra, in order to identify whether
typical IB proﬁles can be observed co-spatial to QSEBs,
is still required.

Recently, Reid et al. (2017) used RADYN simulations
(Carlsson & Stein 1992, 1995) to model one-dimensional
solar atmospheres perturbed by energy deposition at

multiple layers. These authors then synthesised Hα and
Ca II 8542 ˚A line proﬁles ﬁnding that impulsive energy
releases in the upper photosphere could account for EB
signatures. Whether such techniques and models could
reproduce QSEB signatures (i.e., Hα wing emission with
no co-temporal Ca II 8542 ˚A response), however, is still
unknown and will be discussed here.

In this article, we aim to further understand both
QSEBs and IBs, speciﬁcally by researching whether
IBs are also evident in the quiet-Sun co-spatial to any
QSEBs. We structure our work as follows: In Section 2,
we introduce the observations analysed here. Section 3
presents our results, including the inference of the basic
properties of QSEBs and an analysis of the signatures of
one of these events in spectra collected by IRIS. Finally,
we draw our conclusions in Section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONS
The ground-based observations analysed in this article
were acquired with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarime-
ter (CRISP: Scharmer 2006; Scharmer et al. 2008) at the
Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST: Scharmer et al. 2003)
on 9th June 2016. A quiet-Sun region (co-ordinates of
xc ≈ −900′′, yc ≈ −100′′) was selected for observation
between 07:39:29 UT and 08:28:54 UT. The observing
sequence applied during this time consisted of a 21 point
Hα line-scan and a 21-point full-Stokes Ca II 8542 ˚A
line scan, both of which sampled ±2 ˚A into the wings
of the lines. Wideband images were also acquired for
Hα and Ca II 8542 ˚A at each time-step for alignment
purposes. These data were reduced using the multi-
object multi-frame blind deconvolution (MOMFBD;
van Noort et al. 2005) method, with eight exposures at

set indicates the pixel and pixels selected to construct line proﬁles of the QSEBs and (time-averaged) background atmosphere, respectively.
The red contours indicate the pixels over 130 % of the background intensity in the Hα line wings. (Bottom row) The Hα and Ca II 8542

each wavelength position, and following the CRISPRED
pipeline (see de la Cruz Rodr´ıguez et al. 2015). Analy-
sis was conducted, in part, using the CRISPEX pack-
age (Vissers & Rouppe van der Voort 2012). The ﬁnal
science-ready cadence and pixel-scale of these data were
26.5 seconds and 0.058′′, respectively.

Co-spatial and co-temporal data from three ﬁlters (304
˚A, 1600 ˚A, and 1700 ˚A) of the Solar Dynamics Ob-
servatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA;
Lemen et al. 2012) instrument were also analysed. A
100′′×100′′ region centred on the CRISP/SST ﬁeld-of-
view (FOV) was downloaded for the entire time-series.
The pixel-scale of these data is approximately 0.6′′ (cor-
responding to around 435 km in the horizontal scale).
The cadence of these data is wavelength-dependent, be-
ing 12 seconds for the 304 ˚A data and 24 seconds for the
1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A data. Alignment of the SDO/AIA
ﬁlters with the SST/CRISP line scans was achieved by
matching the solar limb and stable network bright points
within the 1600 ˚A and wideband Ca II 8542 ˚A con-
text images through time. The initial FOV of these
data is plotted for reference in Fig. 1 including a larger
SDO/AIA 1700 ˚A context image (left panel) and (clock-
wise from the top left in the right panel) SST/CRISP

images for the Hα blue wing (−1 ˚A), Hα line core, Ca II
8542 line core, and Hα red wing (+1 ˚A). The white box
in the left panel indicates the SST/CRISP FOV.

Finally, data from the IRIS satellite were also anal-
ysed. IRIS collected ﬁve dense 320-step rasters between
07:31:21 UT and 11:39:14 UT, with the ﬁrst raster co-
inciding temporally with the SST/CRISP observations.
However, as IRIS began the scan oﬀ the solar disk and
then progressed across the SST/CRISP FOV, only those
data sampled between 08:10:00 UT and 08:20:00 UT are
co-temporal and co-spatial to the SST/CRISP dataset.
Slit-jaw images (SJIs) were sampled by the 1400 ˚A, 2796
˚A, and 2832 ˚A ﬁlters with cadences of 18.6 s, 18.6 s
(with every ﬁfth frame skipped to collect 2832 ˚A im-
ages), and 93 s, respectively. The spatial resolution of
these data was ∼ 0.33′′. Alignment of these data to the
SST/CRISP, and hence the SDO/AIA, FOV was com-
pleted by correlating the 2832 ˚A channel to wide-band
Ca II 8542 ˚A images. The IRIS spectral data had an ex-
posure time of ∼ 8 s and a spectral dispersion of approx-
imately 0.026 ˚A for both the NUV and FUV windows.

2.1. Feature Identiﬁcation

4

Nelson et al.

Candidate QSEBs were selected by locating small-scale
(< 2′′), short-lived (1 < lifetime < 15 min) regions of
intense brightness (over 130 % of the local background
intensity) in the near wings (±1 ˚A) of the Hα line proﬁle.
This threshold is lower compared to the 150 % threshold
used by, for example, Vissers et al. (2013); Nelson et al.
(2015)) and was selected due to the inherent lower
line wing intensity enhancements identiﬁed co-spatial to
QSEBs by Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016). Next,
we speciﬁed that the proportional increase in intensity
from the background decreased further out in the wings
(±2 ˚A) in order to diﬀerentiate QSEBs from magnetic
concentrations (MCs or ‘pseudo-EBs’; see Rutten et al.
2013) which are known to increase the continuum inten-
sity. Once the candidate QSEBs had been detected, the
Hα line core images were examined in order to remove
features which corresponded to Hα micro-ﬂares (features
with obvious emission in the Hα line core). Finally,
apparent explosive behaviour (rapid morphological evo-
lutions widely associated with EBs; Nelson et al. 2015;
Vissers et al. 2015) was required, allowing us to conﬁ-
dently remove any remaining MCs. Overall, 21 QSEBs
were located in this dataset for further study.

Three of the QSEBs selected for analysis here are pre-
sented in Fig. 2 for reference. The frames in the top
row plot Hα blue wing (−1 ˚A), line core, Ca II 8542
˚A blue wing (−1 ˚A), and Ca II 8542 ˚A line core im-
ages co-spatial and co-temporal to individual QSEBs. A
long, thin brightening reminiscent of the events stud-
ied by Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016) can be ob-
served in the Hα line wing for each example, however,
no unambiguous increase in intensity can be observed
in any other panel of these plots. Slight Ca II 8542
˚A wing enhancement similar to one case presented by
Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016) were evident in two
QSEBs from our sample; however,
inspection of the
imaging data revealed blurred patches, dissimilar to the
compact Hα features in both time and space, implying
that these co-spatial brightenings may not be linked to
the QSEB itself. The red crosses and white boxes in the
top left panels of each column indicate the pixel and set
of pixels used to construct QSEB (solid line) and time-
averaged quiet-Sun reference (dashed line) proﬁles, re-
spectively. These proﬁles are plotted in the bottom pan-
els of Fig. 2, where red crosses indicate the wavelength
positions plotted in the upper row. Obvious increases in
intensity are evident in the wings of the Hα line proﬁle
(peaking at approximately ±1 ˚A) for each of these events
conﬁrming their QSEB-like nature. The event plotted in
the right-hand column is the feature sampled by the IRIS
slit during its lifetime.

3. RESULTS
3.1. Properties of QSEBs derived from imaging data
We begin our analysis by acquiring measurements of
the lengths, widths, and lifetimes of the 21 QSEB events
studied in this article using CRISPEX. These measure-
ments allow QSEBs to be compared with the EBs dis-
cussed in the literature (speciﬁcally by Nelson et al.
2015 who used a dataset with an identical spatial res-
olution thereby obtaining exactly comparable results)
and to reaﬃrm the properties of QSEBs reported by
Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016). In the top panel of

Fig. 3.— (Top row) Length against width plot for the QSEBs dis-
cussed in this article [diamonds] and EBs analysed by Nelson et al.
(2015) [crosses]. (Bottom row) Same as for the top row except for
length against lifetime.

Fig. 3, we plot the lengths and widths of the sample of
QSEBs measured here [diamonds] and the AR EBs dis-
cussed by Nelson et al. (2015) [crosses]. It is immediately
evident that the QSEBs are, in general, smaller than
their AR counter-parts. The means of the lengths and
widths of these QSEBs were found to be 0.63′′ (σ=0.17′′)
and 0.35′′ (σ=0.08′′), respectively. In the bottom frame
of Fig. 3, we plot the length against lifetime of these
QSEB features and the EBs studied by Nelson et al.
(2015). The mean lifetime of these QSEBs is approx-
imately 120 s (σ=60 s), around one minute higher
than the value reported by Rouppe van der Voort et al.
(2016). As the minimum possible lifetime of events in
this sample was 53 seconds, it is likely that this diﬀerence
is due to the relatively low cadence of the data analysed
here. Indeed, several events in our sample were observed
to live for around 4 minutes, with seemingly repetitive
parabolic ‘ﬂaming’ (see Fig. 4) which occurred over the
course of one or two frames. For consistency, we did not
classify each individual ﬂame as a separate event, thereby
increasing the mean. Recalculating the mean to account

Fig. 4.— The evolution of a repetitive QSEB over the course of around four minutes in the blue wing (−1 ˚A; top row), line core (middle
row) and red wing (+1 ˚A; bottom row) of the Hα line proﬁle. A clear extension (second column) can be observed in the Hα line wings
before its retraction (third column), and re-emergence (fourth column). This behaviour is similar to the evolution of certain EBs reported
in the literature.

for repetition within the sample lowers the average life-
time of these QSEBs to 106 s (σ=47 s).

Of the 21 events analysed here, three were observed
to display such impulsive repetitive behaviour over short
time-scales during their lifetimes. This behaviour was
not apparent in the majority of features studied by
Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016).
In Fig. 4, we plot
the evolution of the left-hand event presented in Fig. 2
at 53 s intervals for three positions within the Hα line
proﬁle, namely −1 ˚A, the line core, and +1 ˚A. In the
second column, a QSEB is easily observed which then
reduces in intensity and length in the 3rd column be-
fore appearing to extend once again in the 4th column.
Through a close inspection of the imaging data during
this time period, it is clear that the apparent fading and
contraction of the QSEB is not due to a reduction in see-
ing quality but is, instead, a real change in morphology
of the event through time. Further to such impulsive re-
currence, we also found one location where at least three
seemingly independent QSEBs occured over the course of
15 minutes. Such recurrence, shown for AR EBs (see, for
example: Qiu et al. 2000; Nelson et al. 2015), is thought,
in-line with the magnetic reconnection hypothesis, to be
indicative of multiple releases of energy from the same
spatial location, potentially due to ﬂux build up through
time (see, for example, Reid et al. 2016).

SDO/AIA images co-spatial to these QSEBs were also
analysed. As with EBs identiﬁed in ARs (see, e.g,
Vissers et al. 2013; Nelson et al. 2015), no signature of
QSEBs was observed in the SDO/AIA 304 ˚A ﬁlter. In
Fig. 5, we plot expanded FOVs around the three QSEBs
presented in Fig. 2 for the Hα blue wing (−1 ˚A; left-

hand panel), the SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A ﬁlter (central panel),
and the SDO/AIA 1700 ˚A ﬁlter (right-hand panel). The
small-scale QSEBs (in the Hα data) are almost entirely
covered by the red crosses, which indicate the pixels se-
lected to construct the lightcurves in the bottom panels.
No signature was observed co-spatial to any QSEBs in
the SDO/AIA 1700 ˚A channel, however, the events plot-
ted in the central and right-hand columns of Fig. 5 did
appear to be linked to burst-like events in the SDO/AIA
1600 ˚A ﬁlter. The isolation of the UV intensity enhance-
ment to the SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A data could be due to in-
creased emission of the TR C IV in that ﬁlter rather than
enhancements in the continuum intensity, potentially in-
dicating that increased Si IV emission would also be ex-
pected. The red boxes over-laid on the SDO/AIA images
indicate the regions selected to construct lightcurves.

The Hα line wing lightcurves plotted in the top panels
of the bottom row of Fig. 5 depict the short-lived (of the
order minutes) intensity increases which are indicative
of the presence of the QSEBS. Both QSEBs displayed in
the left (plotted through time in Fig. 4) and right-hand
columns are repetitive through their lifetimes, with indi-
vidual peaks highlighted by the arrows. The dashed ver-
tical lines indicate the frames plotted in the top row. The
SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A lightcurves (middle row) plotted in the
central and right-hand columns display short-lived peaks
in intensity co-temporal to the formation of the QSEBs,
with the right-hand column exhibiting the clearest ex-
ample of this behaviour. The intensity for the minutes
surrounding the QSEB approaches 150 % of the time-
averaged local background intensity. These increases in
SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A intensity, co-temporal to only a small

fraction of these QSEBs, are comparable to the signa-
tures identiﬁed co-spatial to EBs in ARs.

3.2. Links Between QSEBs And IBs
As IRIS was conducting a raster from oﬀ the limb to
the solar disk, only the six QSEB features which occurred
between 08:10:00 UT and 08:20:00 UT were studied us-
ing data collected by the SJI. This sample included the
features plotted in the central and right-hand columns of
Fig. 2 and Fig. 5. In Fig. 6 we plot the 1400 ˚A (second
row), 2796 ˚A (third row), and 2832 ˚A (bottom row) re-
sponses to the QSEBs (plotted in the Hα blue wing in
the top row). Of these events, two (the QSEBs displayed
in the second and sixth columns which correspond to
the central and right-hand events of Fig. 5, respectively)
were identiﬁed to form co-spatial to short-lived increases
in intensity in the Si IV 1400 ˚A ﬁlter, which appeared
analogous to IBs (see, for example, Peter et al. 2014;
Vissers et al. 2015; Tian et al. 2016). None of the other
four events were observed co-spatial to IBs, agreeing with
the results of Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016) that
the majority of QSEBs display no TR signature. The
two QSEBs which formed co-spatial to obvious IRIS sig-
natures were neither particularly large, intense, or long-
lived, appearing to be similar to the majority of QSEBs
in this sample.

Interestingly, the feature in the right-hand column of
Fig. 6 was also sampled by the IRIS slit during its life-
time displaying an IRIS burst-like spectrum. In the top
row of Fig. 7, we plot the Si IV 1393 ˚A (left) and Si IV
1403 ˚A (right) spectral proﬁles sampled at the location
of the IB (black line) and averaged over a quieter region
close to this feature (red line). The bottom row plots the
C II (left) and Mg II (right) spectra. Wavelength cali-

bration was conducted following the method suggested
by Tian et al. (2016). The Si IV 1393.755 ˚A window
Doppler shift was estimated using the Ni II 1393.330
˚A line (which was assumed to have zero Doppler shift).
This shift was then also applied to the Si IV 1402.770 ˚A
window. The C II spectral window was calibrated using
the Ni II 1335.203 ˚A line (which, again, was assumed
to have no Doppler shift). The accuracy of the detected
shifts were conﬁrmed by the similarity of the shifts in the
Ni II 1393.330 ˚A and Ni II 1335.203 ˚A lines. The shift in
the Mg II window was estimated using the neutral Mn I
2795.633 ˚A line.

The general shapes of the plotted spectral lines sam-
pled at the location of the QSEB are similar to IBs dis-
cussed in the literature (see, for example, Peter et al.
2014; Tian et al. 2016 for a variety of IB spectra), in-
cluding wider and brighter Si IV proﬁles, increases in
the Mg II and C II line wing intensities, and absorption
proﬁles of some chromospheric lines (for example, Ni II
1335.203 ˚A, Ni II 1393.330 ˚A, Fe II 1403.225 ˚A). The
ratio between the intensities of the Si IV 1393 ˚A and
Si IV 1403 ˚A lines at the location of the QSEB is ∼ 1.71,
lower than that calculated for the reference proﬁles of
∼ 1.80 and the optically thin case of 2. In addition to
this, some absorption is observed in the core of the Si IV
1393 line, consistent with the self absorption discussed
by Yan et al. (2015). These proﬁles provide the ﬁrst ev-
idence that certain QSEBs can occur co-spatial to IBs.

Quantitatively, the increases in intensity and line-
width measured co-spatial to this QSEB are around an
order of magnitude smaller than those previously re-
ported around IBs (although it should be noted they
are similar to some examples, including IB 5 discussed

by Tian et al. 2016). This could be expected, however,
given the reduced sizes and lower Hα line wing intensi-
ties of QSEBs in comparison to AR EBs (as well as the
typically lower background intensities in the quiet-Sun).
Interestingly, the Si IV line widths measured for this IB
are smaller than observed for most IBs in the literature.
Potentially, this could be caused by the viewing angle
as, if the bi-directional jets associated with the QSEB
are predominantly vertical, only the limited line-of-sight
component of such motions would be measured; however,
this is currently only speculation.

In Fig. 8, we plot spectral data for two further IBs
(with the same layout as applied in Fig. 7) which oc-
curred after the SST/CRISP instrument had stopped ac-
quisition. Therefore, these events could not be linked to
any QSEB. The Si IV spectra for both of the events plot-
ted in Fig. 8 displayed much larger line widths than the
event plotted in Fig. 7 appearing to be analogous to the
features discussed by Tian et al. (2016). The ratios be-
tween the two Si IV lines are 1.83 and 1.47 for Examples
1 and 2, respectively, and again indicate a departure from
the optically thin regime. It should be noted that the in-
tensity enhancement in the Si IV line cores for Example
2 are twice those measured for the QSEB-linked IB and
are, therefore, comparable to the intensities measured
co-spatial to IBs in ARs by Tian et al. (2016).

The C II data for both IBs display broadened and en-

hanced line wings. The Mg II h&k peak intensities in
Fig.8 are also slightly asymmetric, most likely due to
velocity gradients in the atmosphere shifting the wave-
length of maximum opacity to the red causing increased
emission in the blue peak. This eﬀect has been described
in detail in Carlsson & Stein (1997) and observed in ﬂare
line proﬁles presented in Kuridze et al. (2015) (for Hα)
and Kerr et al. (2016) (for Mg II). Both of the events
plotted in Fig. 8 also show evidence of self-absorption in
the Si IV 1393 ˚A line, with Example 1 displaying clear
self-absorption in the Si IV 1403 ˚A line as well. This
self-absorption is also consistent with the scenario sug-
gested by Yan et al. (2015), whereby the increased den-
sity within the feature causes absorption at the line core.

3.3. Hα and Ca II 8542 ˚A line synthesis
Finally, we investigate one-dimensional RADYN sim-
ulations (Carlsson & Stein 1992, 1995) created by per-
turbing three quiet solar-like atmospheres by deposit-
ing energy at a range of heights (building on the work
recently presented by Reid et al. 2017). The motiva-
tion of this work is to attempt to explain the proﬁles
displayed in Fig. 2, where the Hα wing intensities are
enhanced but no Ca II 8542 ˚A response is observed.
Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016) suggested that this
observational signature is caused by the occurrence of the
QSEB at heights which do not inﬂuence the Ca II 8542 ˚A

line. Whether such layers exist still requires veriﬁcation.
We conducted a large range of simulations where either
100 erg cm−3 s−1, 300 erg cm−3 s−1, or 500 erg cm−3 s−1
of energy was inputted into a static atmospheric model
at deposition layers (ranging from the photosphere to the
chromosphere) which had heights of either 50 km or 200
km. We allowed the systems to stablise for 9 s, before
Hα and Ca II 8542 ˚A line proﬁles were constructed after
10 s of solar time using the MULTI package built into
RADYN. Overall, more than 70 models were considered.
Before considering the results of these simulations, we
brieﬂy discuss the reasons for selecting the parameters
introduced in the previous paragraph. Firstly, we con-
sidered energy deposition layers of 50 km and 200 km
as smaller values would be below the spatial resolution
of instruments such as the SST/CRISP and larger layers
would be well above the local scale height. Any energy
deposition layers larger than 200 km would, therefore,
not satisfy the condition that energy is deposited at a
preferential location in the solar atmosphere, causing the
observed spectral proﬁles of QSEBs. Secondly, the 500
erg cm−3 s−1 energy deposition rate was found to pro-
duce unrealistically high intensity enhancement in the
Hα line proﬁles. Therefore, we do not consider any en-
ergy deposition rates higher than this. Energy deposition
rates lower than 100 erg cm−3 s−1 did not provide the
required Hα wing intensity increases and were also not
considered. Finally, three diﬀerent starting atmospheres
(one quiet Sun, as well as QS.SL.LT and QS.SL.HT from
Allred et al. 2015) were studied although the results ob-
tained for each were comparable and, as such, we only

present results from the quiet Sun atmosphere.

In the left hand panel of Fig. 9, we plot examples of
temperature proﬁles for ﬁve 200 km high energy (300 erg
cm−3 s−1) deposition layer simulation runs, measured at
t = 10 s. Each coloured line in the left-hand panel de-
notes a diﬀerent energy deposition layer. These examples
are representative of the entire suite of models which we
studied. The centre and right hand panels plot the re-
spective Hα and Ca II 8542 ˚A synthesised line proﬁles.
It is immediately evident that the higher the energy is
deposited in the atmosphere, the more emission the syn-
thesised wings of both the Hα and Ca II 8542 ˚A lines
In no case do the synthesised Hα wings form
display.
in emission when the Ca II 8542 ˚A wings do not. On
the contrary, when the energy is deposited between 200-
400 km, enhanced Ca II 8542 ˚A line wings are evident
with no response from Hα. Qualitatively, these results
do not change when one considers the shorter 50 km en-
ergy deposition bins. The line core intensities of both
lines are also increased for higher energy deposition lay-
ers, although, this is probably due to the lack of three-
dimensional eﬀects (i.e., the lack of overlying canopy) in
the simulations. Varying the energy deposition rate only
changes the level of enhancement across both lines.

The strong connection between Hα line wing increases
and Ca II 8542 ˚A line wing increases in these simulations
comes from the modiﬁcation of the contribution function
of both lines due to the energy deposition. In the top
panel of Fig. 10, we plot the diﬀerence between the t = 0
s and t = 10 s contribution functions for the Hα line pro-
ﬁle, for a representative 200 km high energy deposition

(green; arbitrary scaling) and the τ = 1 height (red).
The bright regions at a simulation height of 400 km and
a Doppler shift of ±20 km s−1 indicate the locations at
which the enhanced emission in the Hα line wings (typi-
cal of EBs and QSEBs) occurs. The bottom panel plots
the corresponding information for the Ca II 8542 ˚A line
proﬁle. This diﬀerenced contribution function also dis-

plays the bright regions (which are, perhaps, even more
obvious than in Hα) at Doppler shifts of around ±20
km s−1, which lead to increases in intensity in the Ca II
8542 ˚A line wings. Due to the change in the source func-
tion and opacity caused by the heating, the contribution
of both the Hα and Ca II 8542 ˚A line wings increases
at these heights, regardless of the quiet-Sun formation
heights of these lines. Overall, these results do not ap-

pear to support the assertion that energy deposition, con-
sistent with EBs and QSEBs, at speciﬁc heights in the
solar atmosphere can lead to Hα wing emission without
Ca II 8542 ˚A wing intensity enhancements. However, fu-
ture work should aim to investigate this further, perhaps
using diﬀerent starting atmosphere models.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
QSEBs are an interesting newly discovered phe-
nomenon, identiﬁed by increases in intensity in the Hα
line wings similar to EBs (Ellerman 1917; Nelson et al.
2015; Vissers et al. 2015) but located in the quiet-Sun.
These events are thought to highlight the occurrence
of magnetic reconnection in the photosphere outside
of ARs, perhaps similar to the modelling presented
In this
by Nelson et al. (2013) and Danilovic (2017).
paper, we have not only corroborated the results of
Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016), but have also high-
lighted some new properties of these features, includ-
ing repetition over both short and long time-scales (in
comparison to the lifetimes of the QSEBs), and shown
the presence of an IB co-spatial to an individual QSEB
(similar in nature to IB occurrence co-spatial to EBs;
Tian et al. 2016), thereby also conﬁrming the presence
of IBs in the quiet-Sun. In the following paragraphs we
shall present a brief overview of our results and discuss
how they ﬁt in with the current understanding of small-
scale reconnection events.

Initially, 21 QSEBs were identiﬁed in Hα line scans col-
lected at the solar limb by the SST/CRISP instrument.
The basic properties of these events were comparable to
those found by Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016) with
average lifetimes, lengths, and widths of approximately
120 s, 0.63′′, and 0.35′′, respectively. These values are at
the lower end of the spectrum of properties previously
derived for EBs in ARs, as is shown in Fig. 3. Two fea-
tures within this sample did appear co-spatial to limited
(< 120 %) Ca II 8542 ˚A wing brightenings, however, as
the bright regions in the Ca II 8542 ˚A line wings bore
little resemblence to the clear, elongated QSEBs identi-

ﬁed in Hα, it is likely that the Ca II 8542 ˚A heightened
wing emission was not related to the QSEB. By study-
ing a large range of RADYN simulated proﬁle, created
by perturbed reference proﬁles by an input of energy, we
were unable to reproduce line proﬁles which displayed
enhanced Hα line wing emission and no Ca II 8542 ˚A
response (see Fig. 9).

Repetitive, impulsive ﬂame-like behaviour (shown to
see, e.g., Vissers et al. 2015;
be common for EBs;
Nelson et al. 2015) was observed for three QSEB events
in our sample. The evolution of one of these QSEBs
is detailed in Fig. 4 and the lightcurves constructed
for that event and one further example are plotted in
the left and right-hand columns of Fig. 5, respectively,
with the repetitive peaks indicated by the arrows. Such
repetition was not widely observed either here or by
Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016), begging the ques-
tion as to whether recurrence is common across the so-
lar disk or whether it is only limited to certain regions
with currently unknown similarities where, perhaps, ﬂux
build-up occurs more readily (for example, at super-
granular boundaries).

Two of these QSEBs formed co-spatial to burst events
in the SDO/AIA 1600 ˚A UV and SJI 1400 ˚A data, with
one of these events being sampled by the IRIS slit dur-
ing its lifetime. The IRIS spectra displaying increased
intensity in the Si IV 1393 ˚A and 1403 ˚A lines, as well
as wing intensity increases in the C II and Mg II spec-
tral windows (see Fig. 7). These proﬁles were analo-
gous to IBs discussed in the literature (Peter et al. 2014;
Vissers et al. 2015; Tian et al. 2016). The Si IV line
widths were smaller than the majority of IBs, however,
this could be due to line-of-sight eﬀects if the dominant
motion of the QSEB is vertical away from the solar disk
(i.e., perpendicular to the line-of-sight). Support for this
assertion was found through analysis of several other IBs,
which were identiﬁed in these data (presented in Fig. 8).
These IBs displayed larger Si IV line widths in addition
to blue shifted Mg II proﬁles potentially indicating ve-
locities in the line-of-sight.

Rouppe van der Voort et al. (2016). However, the IBs
co-spatial to two of these features indicate that that some
(likely a small minority of) QSEBs could be linked to
localised heating of plasma to TR temperatures, in a
similar manner to energetic EBs in ARs. Future ob-
servational work should be carried out to discover how
common such apparently energetic QSEBs are. It also
remains to be seen whether the interesting Hα and Ca II
8542 ˚A signatures of QSEBs can be reproduced through
further semi-empirical modelling.
