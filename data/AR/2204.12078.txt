The development of integrated semiconductor lasers has miniaturized traditional bulky laser systems, en-
abling a wide range of photonic applications. A progression from pure III-V based lasers to III-V/external
cavity structures has harnessed low-loss waveguides in different material systems, leading to signiﬁcant im-
provements in laser coherence and stability. Despite these successes, however, key functions remain absent. In
this work, we address a critical missing function by integrating the Pockels effect into a semiconductor laser.
Using a hybrid integrated III-V/Lithium Niobate structure, we demonstrate several essential capabilities that
have not existed in previous integrated lasers. These include a record-high frequency modulation speed of 2
exahertz/s (2.0×1018 Hz/s) and fast switching at 50 MHz, both of which are made possible by integration of the
electro-optic effect. Moreover, the device co-lases at infrared and visible frequencies via the second-harmonic
frequency conversion process, the ﬁrst such integrated multi-color laser. Combined with its narrow linewidth
and wide tunability, this new type of integrated laser holds promise for many applications including LiDAR,
microwave photonics, atomic physics, and AR/VR.

Introduction
The ﬁeld of integrated semiconductor lasers has made many
advances over the last few decades, spanning information
technologies to fundamental science [1–3]. Using wafer-scale
fabrication processes, these devices dramatically reduce the
form factor of traditional bench-top laser equipment, and offer
much lower power consumption and cost. Early laser designs
were based entirely upon III-V semiconductors[4], conﬁgured
either as Fabry-Perot cavities emitting multiple wavelengths,
or as distributed-feedback (DFB) designs for single frequency
emission[5, 6]. Besides providing coherent light generation
across many applications, these devices serve as the key build-
ing block in on-chip systems by driving photonic integrated
circuits (PICs) [7].

With the continuing success of silicon photonics, integrated
lasers have adopted passive cavities that are coupled to a III-
V gain section. Endowed with enhanced photon lifetimes
as well as reconﬁgurability, these integrated external-cavity-
diode-laser (ECDL) structures [8–12], by mimicking their
bulk counterparts [13, 14], have signiﬁcantly improved coher-
ence and tunability in integrated photonics [10, 15–24]. Even
more recently, with remarkable progress in fabrication of low
loss Si/SiN waveguides [16–19], the linewidths of integrated
lasers are now comparable to those of state-of-the-art bench-
top ECDLs and even ﬁber lasers. Such advances in coherence
dramatically improves data capacity in communications [25]
as well as accuracy in on-chip sensing and frequency metrol-

ogy systems [1].

However, despite these impressive achievements, key func-
tions are missing in current integrated lasers. One outstanding
problem lies in fast tuning and reconﬁgurability. Applications
such as LiDAR require frequency modulation of a narrow-
linewidth laser with high linearity and speed beyond the MHz
level [26]. In bench-top laser systems, these are usually real-
ized by fast mechanical motion of components in an external
cavity [13, 14], but similar strategies in integrated photonics
are far more challenging. Most often, frequency tuning of
integrated lasers relies on the thermo-optic (TO) effect [10],
which is relatively slow (kHz-level speed). And even while
MHz-level frequency tuning can be achieved by current sweep
of PN junctions of III-V or silicon waveguides, this carrier-
induced effect produces unwanted intensity modulation [27]
as well as additional loss that are not compatible with nar-
row linewidth lasers . This limitation is more severe at short
wavelength below silicon’s bandgap wavelength, where cur-
rently only thermal tuning can be used for external cavities of
integrated lasers. As an example, in atomic physics, where
switching speeds up to MHz level are required for ion/atom
manipulation at visible and near visible bands, no integrated
photonic solution of laser exist to provide fast reconﬁgurabil-
ity. All current experiments have to rely on additional tun-
ing provided by external modulators. In fact, even generat-
ing coherent light using integrated photonics in these wave-
length is quite challenging.
In contrast to free-space laser
cavities where nonlinear media can be readily implemented
within the resonator to generate short-wavelength light by fre-
quency conversion [28, 29], an integrated nonlinear cavity
suitable for electrical pumping has so far remained elusive.
In these visible/near-visible applications, integrated photonics
must rely on very challenging design, growth, and processing

developments using new gain media. The resulting difﬁcul-
ties have presented a bottleneck to on-chip solutions in a wide
range of evolving applications.

In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new family of
lasers, the Pockels laser, to ﬁll these long-standing gaps in
the integrated photonics paradigm. By using lithium-niobate-
on-insulator (LNOI) waveguide elements to form an external
cavity, we unite a III-V gain section with the Pockels effect
in an integrated laser. This adds several new capabilities to
the toolbox of on-chip lasers including fast on-chip reconﬁg-
urability of a narrow linewdith laser (fundamental lineweidth
11.3 kHz) with laser-frequency tuning at a record speed of 2.0
EHz/s, as well as fast switching at a rate of 50 MHz. On
account of the low required drive voltages, these functions
can be directly driven by CMOS signals. Furthermore, us-
ing an intracavity periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN)
waveguide section embedded in one of the Vernier rings, we
demonstrate the ﬁrst multi-color integrated laser that emits
high-coherence light at telecommunication wavelengths and
in the visible band. It is also the ﬁrst narrow-linewidth laser
with fast reconﬁgurability at visible.

Results

Laser design. The laser structure is shown in Fig. 1a, where
a III-V reﬂective semiconductor optical ampliﬁer (RSOA) is
edge-coupled to an external cavity on a LNOI chip, forming
a hybrid integrated laser [11, 12]. Lithium niobate (LN) is
well-known for its superior capability in optical modulation
and frequency conversion [30–33]. A laser cavity built upon
would enable intriguing laser functionalities signiﬁcantly be-
yond the reach of conventional integrated lasers, as we will
show in detail below. To avoid mode mismatch between the
RSOA and LNOI chip, a spot-size converter is adopted in the
system, obtaining a minimal mode mismatch between a III-V
waveguide and a 5-µm-wide 600-nm-thick LNOI waveguide,
whose mode proﬁles are shown in the Methods. To minimize
facet reﬂection, the III-V facet is coated with anti-reﬂective
(AR) layers, and LNOI’s input-facet coupling waveguide is
angled by 10 degrees to achieve a reduced reﬂectivity (around
10% simulated by FDTD Lumerical) and match the angle of
injected light. The reﬂectivity can be further reduced by ap-
plying AR coating to LNOI’s input-facet.

The LNOI external cavity is a Vernier mirror structure con-

sisting of two racetrack resonators. The geometry of race-
tracks and bus waveguides are tailored to minimize the num-
ber of coupled mode families to avoid multi-mode lasing. The
coupling is carefully selected by taking the lasing power, laser
linewidth, and the tuning speed of the cavity into considera-
tion. The free spectral range (FSR) of the resonators is set
to be 70 GHz, with a 2 GHz difference between the two res-
onators, which corresponds to a Vernier FSR of 2.4 THz [10].
The shape of the racetrack is optimized with the trade-off

between the EO modulation efﬁciency that requires a long
straight section, and the optical scattering loss that requires
a large curvature radius. As a result, an Euler curve proﬁle is
employed to minimize the scattering loss while maximizing
the length of the racetrack. The polarization of the funda-
mental quasi-transverse-electric (quasi-TE) mode is aligned
to harness the large Pockels effect of LN (r33 = 30 pm/V, d33
= 19.5 pm/V [34]) at the straight section of the racetrack.

The ﬁrst
one is incorporated with a micro heater for broad wavelength
tuning via the TO effect, while the second one is integrated
with driving electrodes designed for high-speed EO tuning.
Moreover, the second resonator is tailored to be compatible
with the SHG process, with a PPLN section embedded di-
rectly inside the resonator. Furthermore, a tunable phase con-
trol section is also implemented in the cavity to align the lon-
gitudinal laser cavity mode with the Vernier mode [10]. Ben-
eﬁting from the strong EO Pockels effect in LN, the phase-
control section is operated via the EO effect instead of the
commonly used TO effect [10]. In contrast to the conventional
TO approach that is slow (kHz-speed), power hungry and suf-
fers from the thermal crosstalk problem, the EO Pockels ap-
proach enables high-speed, energy efﬁcient, and independent
control of individual functionalities as we will show below.
Finally, a Sagnac loop ring is placed at the end of the device
to function as the output end mirror of the laser cavity. The
output-facet waveguide is designed for optimized coupling to
a tapered ﬁber for performance characterization, as shown in
Fig. 1b.

Linear performance. A fabricated device is shown in Fig. 1c
(see Methods for the details of device fabrication). The intrin-
sic quality (Q) factor of the racetrack resonators is around 1.2
million, while the external coupling Q is much lower, vary-
ing from 5.0×104 to 1.5×105, which determines the loaded
Q of the device. The laser light-current-voltage (LIV) curve
measurement is performed for the lasing mode at 1581.12 nm,
which has a threshold current of 80 mA and an on-chip power
of around 3.7 mW at 200 mA, as shown in Fig. 2a. The high-
est on-chip power measured from this device can reach more
than 5.5 mW by adjusting the Vernier mirror conditions.

The two racetrack resonators use different coupling struc-
tures: the ﬁrst one uses a Pulley coupler, but the second race-
track adopts a straight waveguide coupler at both telecom
and near-infrared wavelengths for SHG operation. Both bus
waveguides are designed to work only for the fundamental
quasi-TE mode. Fig. 2b shows the details of these two struc-
tures, together with their recorded transmission spectra. A
pulley coupling structure beneﬁts the bandwidth of the las-
ing spectrum, but also raises the risk of multi-mode lasing
(Fig. 2b, lower left). Here, the use of the straight coupling de-
sign for one resonator signiﬁcantly suppresses the mode that is
one Vernier FSR away (Fig. 2b, lower right). With this design,
single-mode laser is achieved, with a high side-mode suppres-
sion ratio (SMSR) greater than 50 dB, as shown in Fig. 2c.
The coarse wavelength tuning is realized by thermo-optical
tuning a Vernier ring resonator as described above, with a tun-
ing range of ∼20 nm from 1576 nm to 1596 nm which agrees
with the designed Vernier FSR (2.4 THz). The high SMSR is
maintained over the entire tuning range.

The linewidth of the laser is ﬁrst characterized by a delayed
self-heterodyne method [36], with a setup shown in Fig. 2d
(details in Methods). The recorded data is ﬁt by a combina-
tion of Lorentzian and Gaussian distributions, resulting in a
Lorentzian linewidth of 15.0 kHz, as shown in Fig. 2e. To
conﬁrm the linewidth, we further applied the correlated de-
layed self-heterodyne phase noise method [19, 37] (details in

4

Methods). The recorded phase noise is shown in Fig. 2f, with
the corresponding frequency noise shown in the inset. The
white noise ﬂoor of ∼1.8×103 Hz2/Hz is found at a frequency
around 3 MHz, which corresponds to an intrinsic linewidth (or
Lorentzian linewidth) of 11.3 kHz for the laser, further con-
ﬁrming the narrow-linewidth performance.

Ultrafast frequency tuning and switching of the laser.
There is an urgent demand for high-speed frequency modu-
lation (chirping) of a narrow linewidth laser in various appli-
cations. For example, the current FMCW LiDAR uses MHz-
level laser-frequency-modulation rate with GHz-level chirp-
ing range. Even higher speed reconﬁgurability is demanded in
applications such as the frequency modulation spectroscopy
[35]. The Pockels laser is ideal for this purpose, where the
laser frequency can be fast tuned by electro-optically tuning
the phase shifter section. As such EO tuning of the phase
shifter only changes the effective optical path length of the
laser cavity while without introducing any loss, it offers an
elegant approach for fast frequency tuning without linewidth
degradation or parasitic intensity modulation.

To show this capability, we apply a high-speed driving
electrical signal to the phase shifter and monitor the laser-
frequency tuning by beating the laser ouput with a reference
narrow-linewidth laser whose frequency has a 8.0-GHz initial
offset (details in Methods). For a better illustration of the ﬁne
tuning performance via the Pockels effect, the driving elec-
trical signal is in a triangular waveform with a modulation
frequency ranging from 0.1 MHz to 1 GHz and an amplitude
of VP = 3.0 V. The heterodyne beat note is recorded and pro-
cessed by a short time Fourier transform (STFT). Recorded
data are shown in Fig. 3a for the modulation frequency rang-
ing from 1 MHz to 500 MHz, together with the deviation of
laser-frequency modulation linearity (details in Methods). As
shown in the ﬁgure, the waveform of laser-frequency mod-
ulation follows faithfully that of the driving electrical signal
(dashed curves) at all frequencies, with a nonlinearity less
than 10% for the modulation frequency up to 500 MHz. As
shown in Fig. 3b, with a lower driving voltage of VP = 2.0 V,
the nonlinearity of laser-frequency modulation can be reduced
to 3%. In Fig. 3a, the resolution of the spectrogram degrades
with increased modulation speed, which is simply due to the
limited sampling rate of the oscilloscope used to record the
laser beating signal.

As shown in Fig. 3c, the amplitude of laser-frequency mod-
ulation remains at a fairly constant level across the broad
range of modulation frequency up to 600 MHz, with a value in
the range of (1.6 – 2.0) GHz that corresponds to a tuning efﬁ-
ciency of (0.26 – 0.34) GHz/V. As a result, the laser-frequency
modulation rate increases nearly linearly with modulation
speed, as shown in Fig. 3d, reaching a value of 2.0 EHz/s
(2.0×1018 Hz/s) at the modulation frequency of 600 MHz.
The frequency modulation rate starts to saturate when the
modulation frequency increases beyond 700 MHz, simply be-
cause the modulation speed reaches the photon lifetime limit
of the laser cavity (estimated to be ∼0.2 ns), leading to a
degradation of EO tuning efﬁciency (Fig. 3c).

The laser-frequency modulation of our laser is fairly inde-
pendent of intensity modulation, since with direct phase mod-

used to boost the electrical signal. See Methods for details). The lower panel shows the deviation of signal compared to the modulating
triangular ramp. (b) Time-frequency spectrogram of the beat note with a smaller driving voltage of VP = 2 V. (c) The recorded laser-frequency

ulation inside the cavity, the intensity variation of the laser is
merely caused by the mode mismatch between the cavity lon-
gitudinal mode and the Vernier mode, which is fairly small
within the bandwidth of the Vernier mode. This feature is
shown in Fig. 3e, which also plots the time-frequency spec-
trogram with a zoom-in amplitude range.
It shows clearly
that a continuous signal is observed, with a small amplitude
variation less than 10 %. This is in strong contrast to other
frequency modulation approaches such as current modulation
of diode laser that suffer from the considerable coexisting in-
tensity modulation, undermining the quality of related appli-
cations. The residual intensity modulation in our laser can
be further suppressed by a coordinated EO tuning of both the
phase shifter and the Vernier ring resonator.

In addition to the pure frequency modulation shown above,
the Pockels laser also allows a fast on-off switching of the
lasing mode. This pure intensity modulation is realized by
applying a square wave to electro-optically drive the race-
track resonator (instead of the phase shifter as done above.
Details in Methods). The consequential mode mismatch be-
tween two resonators introduces rapid degradation of Vernier
mode, resulting in drastic change of the intra-cavity loss,
which enables an on-off behavior of laser, acting as a high-
speed switch. As shown in Fig. 3f, with applied modulating
frequencies ranging from 0.1 MHz to 50 MHz, both on- and
off-states can be observed distinctly with a 10 % – 90 % rise
and fall times around 3 ns, limited by the speed of the applied
driving signal (see Methods). The switching performance de-

grades when the modulation frequency increases beyond 50
MHz, which is likely due to the oscillatory nature of the laser
during cavity mode stabilization [21].

Further increase of the amplitude of the driving electrical
signal would trigger the second adjacent lasing mode, lead-
ing to intriguing fast laser mode switching. Fig. 3g shows
this phenomenon, where the amplitude of the driving square
wave is increased to VP = 4 V, a value adequate to switch the
laser between two lasing modes with one FSR apart. To ob-
serve the switching behavior, the laser output is separated by
a wavelength-division demultiplexer (WDM) into two chan-
nels at different wavelengths to monitor the dynamics of the
individual lasing modes (details in Methods). As shown in
Fig. 3g, the switching between the adjacent laser modes is ob-
served with a clear rising edge around 3 ns. The quality of sig-
nal is limited by the requirements of synchronous control on
the phase shifter for longitudinal mode alignment, which can
be implemented in future work. The fast wavelength switch-
ing demonstrated here is of great potential for application in
data communication and access network.

Dual wavelength laser. In traditional integrated photonics,

SHG can only be pumped using an external laser, which is
complicated in operation, difﬁcult to achieve fast reconﬁgura-
bility. Here, for the ﬁrst time, we incorporate PPLN directly
into the integrated laser cavity, which enables inherent SHG
by the integrated laser itself, signiﬁcantly reducing the system
complexity as shown in Fig. 4a. Moreover, the strong intra-
cavity laser power compared to the laser output can further
enhance the SHG process. The resonance matching between
the fundamental frequency (FF) and second harmonic (SH)
modes for the SHG process is precisely controlled by the tem-
perature of the laser chip (TEC in Fig. 1b). As soon as the
device starts to lase at 1581.12 nm, the produced SH is read-
ily visible at the output facet of the laser chip, as shown in
Fig. 4b. The spectra of the fundamental telecom laser and the
frequency-doubled visible wave are shown in Fig. 4c, showing
a dual-wavelength lasing behavior. The recorded laser out-
put at both wavelengths are plotted in Fig. 4d, which shows a
clear quadratic power dependence between the two colors, an
intrinsic nature of the SHG process.

One great advantage of Pockels laser is the capability to in-
coporate wavelength converters inside the laser cavity, thus of-

ulating its telecom pump laser as shown in the previous sec-
tion. Here we show the MHz-level switching of visible light

square-wave driving signal to modulate the lasing cavity, as
done in Fig. 3f, and monitor the waveform of the frequency-
doubled light (details in Methods). As shown in Fig. 4e, the
on-off switching is clearly observed with a modulation fre-
quency from 0.1 MHz to 10 MHz, with waveforms closely
following those shown in Fig. 3f. Such a switching speed can
satisfy the speed requirement of almost all the atom/ion ma-
nipulating experiment.

The current two-color laser exhibits a wavelength tuability
of ∼ 10 nm. The details are provided in the Method section.
The intracavity PPLN can be further engineered for broad-
band phase matching to cover the entire lasing wavelength
range of the fundamental wave, which would enable a broadly
tunable operation of the two-color laser. On the other hand,
the power of the produced SH light can be further increased
by optimizing the coupling efﬁciency between the RSOA and
the LN chip, which is currently relatively low and limits the
intracavity lasing power at the fundamental frequency. The
SH power can also be increased by implementing longer sec-
tions of PPLN inside the cavity to enhance the SHG efﬁciency.
Moreover, the SHG efﬁciency can be increased by optimizing
the external coupling Q of the resonator. For example, a 10-
fold increase in external coupling Q to 0.6 million will lead
to an SHG conversion efﬁciency of 15 % that corresponds to
more than 1 mW SH power.

Discussion
Besides the performances we presented here, the implementa-
tion of the Pockels effect into integrated laser can lead to more
novel functionalities compared to previous integrated lasers.
The capability of fast laser-frequency reconﬁgurablitiy by the
EO effect, combined with the intensity modulation by vary-
ing the current, potentially can enable fully integrated optical
arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) on chip for communica-
tions and microwave photonics. The cavity design can be fur-
ther optimized by engineering the quality factors of the ring
resonators to support much higher speed modulation, while
maintaining a narrow linewidth at the same level with those of
current ECDLs. Furthermore, by changing the design of the
PPLN inside the resonator, the pump can be frequency con-
verted to a much broader spectrum range, through cascaded
sum frequency generation to shorter wavelength at green or
blue, or optical parametric oscillator to mid-IR wavelength.
Such ﬂexible wavelength generation on-chip can signiﬁcantly
relieve the difﬁculties in material growth and device process-
ing of different laser epi structures. We also expect that,
with the advance of fabrication in increasing the integration
level (heterogeneous integration), a fully integrated, fourndry-
based solution for this new type of laser will show up in the
near future.

In summary, by hybrid integration of a LN external cavity

with a III-V RSOA, we demonstrated the ﬁrst integrated Pock-
els laser. The device exhibits a great reconﬁgurability based
on the EO effect, featuring a record-high laser-frequency
modulation speed of 2.0 EHz/s and switching speed up to 50
MHz. This exceptional performance affords a promising so-
lution to LiDAR and many other applications. Moreover, by
incorporating the high nonlinear frequency conversion capa-
bility of LN, the ﬁrst integrated multi-color laser with telecom
and its SHG wavelength output is realized. The further combi-
nation of these two functions helps to demonstrate fast switch-
ing of the wavelength converter with up to 10 MHz speed,
paving the path to applications of integrated light sources for
atomic physics, AR/VR and sensing.

The demonstrations in this work not only extend the ap-
plications of the LNOI platform, but more generally, provide
a solution to various problems in nanophotonics. They also
provide a design path to multi-color fully integrated systems
with various functionalities. Such systems have many poten-
tial applications in nonlinear optics, optical signal processing
systems, quantum photonics and optical communications.

Methods
Device fabrication. The devices were fabricated on a 600-
nm-thick x-cut single-crystalline LN thin ﬁlm bonded on a
4.7-µm silicon dioxide layer sitting on a silicon substrate
(from NanoLN). The waveguide and racetrack structures are
patterned by ZEP-520A positive resist via electron-beam
lithography; an Ar+ plasma milling process is used to trans-
fer the pattern to the LN layer with the etch depth of 300-nm.
The resist was removed by the solvent 1165 resist remover
afterward. The metal electrode layer (10 nm Ti/500 nm Au)
was patterned by PMMA and deposited by an electron-beam
evaporator, then formed by an overnight lift-off process. Fi-
nally, the devices were diced and polished to minimize the
edge coupling loss.

Spot size converter. The mode mismatch can cause enormous
insertion loss between the RSOA and LNOI chip, which de-
grades the output power of laser seriously. To resolve this
potential issue, we introduce a spot-size converter to the sys-
tem to match the mode proﬁle at the edge of the RSOA. A
minimal mode mismatch is found by the implementation of
an input waveguide with 5 µm width and 600 nm thickness of
LN thin ﬁlm, simulated by an FEM software, as shown in ex-
tended Fig. 5. With an etch depth of LN over 200 nm, minor
variation to the matching efﬁciency is observed, allowing us
to employ it to various designs simply.

Laser linewidth measurement. As shown in Fig. 2d, the las-
ing signal passes a 50:50 splitter. One optical path is delayed
by a 40-km-long ﬁber delay line, while the other is modulated
by an acoustic optic modulator (AOM) at 55 MHz. The 40
km delay line realizes a low linewidth measurement down to 5
kHz, while the AOM is used to apply a frequency detuning to
the signal, resulting in a radio frequency after recombination,
which is relatively free from technical noise from electronics,
vibrations, and other environmental factors. The signals are
recombined by a 50:50 coupler and detected by a high-speed
photodetector, then analyzed by an electrical signal analyzer.

FIG. 6. Characterization of the linearity of laser frequency modulation. The ﬁrst row shows the recorded waveform of the electrical signal
used to drive the phase shifter, together with its deviation to a perfect triangular waveform (induced by an RF ampliﬁer) deﬁned as Deviation 1.
Because of the periodicity of the signal, Deviation 1 is fully represented within one modulation period, which is obtained by averaging it over
multiple modulation periods to have a better accuracy. The periodic waveform of Deviation 1 is thus obtained by duplicating it over multiple
modulation periods in time, as shown in the shaded region. The second row shows the waveform of laser frequency modulation retrieved with
STFT from the recorded laser beat note. Deviation 2 shows its difference from a perfect triangular function, normalized by the peak-peak
amplitude. The last row plots the difference between Deviation 2 and Deviation 1.

The recorded data is ﬁt by a combination of Lorentzian and

Gaussian distributions, resulting in a Lorentzian linewidth of

15.0 kHz, as shown in Fig. 2e.

For the correlated delayed self-heterodyne phase noise
measurement [19, 37]. The experiment setup is similar to the
previous one as shown in Fig. 2d, except that the optical path
is delayed by a 1-km-long ﬁber line, and the signal is pro-
cessed using a real-time oscilloscope. The measured phase
noise is shown in Fig. 2f. The frequency noise is calculated
from the phase noise, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2f. The
white noise ﬂoor of ∼1.8×103 Hz2/Hz is found at a frequency
around 5 MHz. This value can be multiplied by 2π to indicate
the intrinsic linewidth, or Lorentzian linewidth of the laser,
which is 11.3 kHz in this case. The loaded optical Q of this
device is measured to be ∼7.0×104. As a comparison, we
recorded a larger laser linewidth of 41 kHz for another laser
device with a lower optical Q of ∼2.5×104. A higher loaded
Q results in a narrower laser linewidth, which can be further
improved in future work.

Characterization of the linearity of laser frequency modu-

lation. The laser frequency modulation is realized by electro-
optically modulating the phase shifter of the device. The
electrical driving signal with a triangular waveform is gen-
erated by a high-speed arbitrary waveform generator (AWG)
(Keysight M8196A) and is ampliﬁed to aimed voltage ampli-
tudes by a wide-band RF ampliﬁer before it is applied to the
phase shifter. Its waveform is shown in the ﬁrst row of Fig. 7.
Due to the limited bandwidth, the RF ampliﬁer introduces cer-
tain distortions to the signal waveform. We ﬁrst characterize
such distortion by comparing the signal waveform with a per-
fect triangular waveform. Their difference, normalized by the
peak-peak amplitude, is deﬁned as Deviation 1 and is shown
in the ﬁrst row of Fig. 7, which quantiﬁes the magnitude of
waveform distortion of the electrical driving signal. Deviation
1 serves as the reference to characterize the linearity of laser
frequency modulation (see below). Since the signal waveform
is purely periodic, the waveform of Deviation 1 can be fully
represented within one modulation period. To have a better
accuracy, it is obtained by averaging over multiple modula-

range as shown in the ﬁrst column of extended Fig. 7, where
a 3 % deviation is obtained with a 1.2-GHz detuning range.

Switching performance characterization. The lasing mode
switching behavior is explored by the setup shown in Fig. 6.
A square wave is produced by a function generator (Keysight
22621A) and applied to the electrodes sitting beside the res-
onator. By controlling the wavelength mismatch between two
resonators, the lasing mode can be switched from one to an-
other at minimum and maximum values of the square wave
respectively as shown in Fig. 3g. The lasing signal is then
divided by a WDM and converted to electrical signal by two
independent photodetector and recorded by a real-time oscil-
loscope.

The dual-wavelength switching experiment is implemented
with the similar setup via replacing the WDM and one of the
photodetector by a visible band one (Thorlabs APD130A). For
the recorded fundamental switching signals, the rise and fall
time are deﬁned by the bandwidth of function generator. In
comparison, the ones of SHG light are limited by the band-
width of the visible band photodetector, which are around 15
ns. Moreover, in Fig. 4e, the observed spikes are signal over-
shoot/undershoot caused by the same limitation, which are ir-
relevant to the performance of device.

Wide bandwidth dual wavelength laser. Our laser exhibits
wide tunability realized by thermal optical effect, allowing
uniform lasing power as show in Fig. 2c and top of Fig. 8. To
further achieve wide tuning range at visible wavelength, we
tailored the design of PPLN resonator, and obtain a theoretical
phase matching window at 1575 nm with over 20 nm band-
width. By combining these two together, the fundamental
and second-harmonic modes in the resonator are quasi-phase
matched over a broad band, leading to an extremely strong
nonlinearity effect within the cavity. The generated visible
lights are observed and recorded from the same device in the
bottom of Fig. 8, which proves the wide tunability of our laser
at visible band over 10 nm. The slight power variation of the
SH light can be further optimized in the future by modifying
the coupling strength at SH resonances of the PPLN resonator.

tion periods.

The beat note between the Pockels laser and the refer-
ence ECDL is recorded by a real-time oscilloscope (Keysight
UXR0334A), as illustrated in Fig. 6b. The recorded signal
is processed by STFT to retrieve the time-frequency spectro-
gram which is shown in the second row of extended Fig. 7.
It is compared with a perfect triangular waveform, and their
difference, normalized by the peak-peak amplitude, gives De-
viation 2 which is also shown in the second row of Fig. 7. The
difference between Deviation 2 and Deviation 1 thus charac-
terizes the linearity of laser frequency modulation. The wave-
form is shown in the third row of Fig. 7 (also in Fig. 3a and
b of the main text). As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the net
deviation is less than 10 % at all measured frequencies, indi-
cating a high linearity of laser frequency modulation over a
large frequency tuning range. Moreover, of one’s preference,
a higher linearity can be achieved by sacriﬁcing the tuning
