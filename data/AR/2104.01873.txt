ABSTRACT

We present a study on the spatially scanned spectroscopic observations of the transit of GJ 1132 b, a warm (∼500
K) Super-Earth (1.13 R⊕) that was obtained with the G141 grism (1.125 - 1.650 µm) of the Wide Field Camera 3
(WFC3) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We used the publicly available Iraclis pipeline to extract the planetary
transmission spectra from the ﬁve visits and produce a precise transmission spectrum. We analysed the spectrum
using the TauREx3 atmospheric retrieval code with which we show that the measurements do not contain molecular
signatures in the investigated wavelength range and are best-ﬁt with a ﬂat-line model. Our results suggest that the
planet does not have a clear primordial, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Instead, GJ 1132 b could have a cloudy
hydrogen-dominated envelope, a very enriched secondary atmosphere, be airless, or have a tenuous atmosphere that
has not been detected. Due to the narrow wavelength coverage of WFC3, these scenarios cannot be distinguished yet
but the James Webb Space Telescope may be capable of detecting atmospheric features, although several observations
may be required to provide useful constraints.

1. INTRODUCTION

One major obstacle that exoplanetary researchers en-
counter is a general lack of data. This makes it diﬃcult
to determine the composition and internal structure of
exoplanets as there is an inevitable strong degeneracy
when one tries to ﬁt a model to observations. By mak-
ing use of geophysical and statistical principles, several
studies have determined the degree of degeneracy in ex-
oplanet compositions (e.g. Adams et al. 2008; Valencia
et al. 2013; Dorn et al. 2017). They found that know-
ing the mass and radius of a planet precisely can lead
to superior constraints on the ice mass fraction and size
of the inner embryo, but little improvement on the at-
mospheric composition. However, they also found that
determining the atmospheric composition (such as from
spectroscopy) could lead to a signiﬁcant improvement
of the interior predictions. Therefore, there is a strong
motivation to characterise exoplanetary atmospheres as
this would lead to a better understanding on the global
properties of their host planets.

In spite of this, under most circumstances only the
mass and radius of exoplanets are known, so all that
can be done is constrain the internal compositions from
the bulk mean densities (e.g. Zeng & Sasselov 2013;
Zeng et al. 2016). Recent advances in exoplanetary
spectroscopy have allowed for the atmospheric compo-
sition and structure to be constrained enough to attain
a more holistic understanding of the planet. For in-
stance, from the mass and radius of a planet one cannot
tell whether a super-Earth or sub-Neptune is H2O-rich
or a silicate embryo with a hydrogen envelope (e.g. Va-
lencia et al. 2013). However, if one were to constrain
the atmospheric composition of these perplexing bodies,
then one could determine whether the planet is icy (i.e.
no atmosphere or a H2O-rich one if the temperature is
high enough) or rocky with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere
(i.e. collisional absorption lines of hydrogen are detected
with, perhaps, some mineral or volcanic species).

A number of studies using HST WFC3 have found ev-
idence for molecular absorption in Sub-Neptunes (e.g.
Guo et al. 2020; Guilluy et al. 2021). Of particular note
are the studies of the habitable-zone planet K2-18 b,
which likely has a hydrogen–helium envelope with a high
concentration of water vapor (Tsiaras et al. 2019; Ben-
neke et al. 2019) and possibly CH4 (B´ezard et al. 2020;
Blain et al. 2021). Meanwhile, GJ 1214 b most prob-
ably hosts a thick cloud layer, with molecular features
belonging to cloud-free primary atmosphere, or one com-
posed of 100% H2O and 100% CO2, having been ruled
out (e.g. Kreidberg et al. 2014).

Whilst the atmospheric spectroscopy of small, poten-
tially rocky, exoplanets is diﬃcult, several analyses have

already been made on well-known systems. For exam-
ple:

• TRAPPIST-1 b, c, d, e, f and g most probably do
not have cloud-free hydrogen atmospheres (e.g. de
Wit et al. 2016).

• The HST WFC3 transmission spectrum of the
highly irradiated Super-Earth 55 Cnc e shows evi-
dence for Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) (Tsiaras et al.
2016c). However, the exact nature of its atmo-
sphere, and whether it exists, is still highly de-
bated (Madhusudhan et al. 2012; Dorn et al. 2019;
Modirrousta-Galian et al. 2020a; Jindal et al. 2020;
Zilinskas et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2021)

• LHS 1140 b, a super-Earth orbiting in the
habitable-zone of its star, potentially hosts an
atmosphere containing water vapour but the low
SNR, and narrow wavelength coverage, of the data
means this detection is tentative (Edwards et al.
2021).

Additionally, the Spitzer phase curve of the terrestrial
planet LHS 3844 b is incompatible with a thick atmo-
sphere (Kreidberg et al. 2019). Thus, so far, there have
been no deﬁnitive measurements of the atmosphere of a
rocky exoplanet.

In this paper we perform a spectroscopic analysis of
GJ 1132 b with the aim of determining its atmospheric
composition. Making use of the mass and radius mea-
surements from the literature, we then make inferences
on the interior composition and properties of GJ 1132 b.
Having a mass, radius, and equilibrium temperature of
1.66 ± 0.23 M⊕, 1.130 ± 0.056 R⊕, and 500 − 600 K (Bon-
ﬁls et al. 2018) respectively, GJ 1132 b is a super-Earth
that may be an ice planet that migrated inwards, or a
silicate embryo with a hydrogen envelope (see Figure 1).
A mixture of these two compositions or a more exotic
make-up may also be possible (Zeng et al. 2016).

In order to try to overcome this degeneracy we per-
form a spectroscopic analysis on the spectral data ob-
tained through Hubble observations. Using ﬁve transit
observations, we recover a ﬂat spectrum which shows no
sign of atmospheric features. We rule out a clear hy-
drogen/helium dominated atmosphere to > 5σ. Future
observations are required to conﬁdently distinguish be-
tween a cloudy primary atmosphere or one with a higher
mean molecular weight.

2. METHOD

2.1. Data analysis

Our analysis is based on ﬁve transit observations
of GJ 1132 b (Table 1) obtained between April and

3

of 170 pixels and a maximum pixel ﬂuence below 24,000
electrons.

Following the procedure already described in similar
studies (e.g. Edwards et al. 2020a; Skaf et al. 2020;
Anisman et al. 2020; Changeat & Edwards 2021), we
extract white and spectral light-curves from the raw
HST/WFC3 images using the Iraclis software (Tsiaras
et al. 2016b).
Iraclis is an open-source software ded-
icated to the analysis of WFC3 scanning observations
and is publicly available on GitHub2. In the following
we brieﬂy summarise the data analysis steps operated
by the software, but we refer the reader to Tsiaras et al.
(2016b) for a complete discussion.

2.1.1. Data reduction and calibration

The Iraclis reduction process included the following
zero-read subtraction, reference pixels correc-
steps:
tion, non-linearity correction, dark current subtraction,
gain conversion, sky background subtraction, calibra-
tion, ﬂat-ﬁeld correction, and corrections for bad pixels
and cosmic rays (Tsiaras et al. 2016b). In each of the
visits, we noted several faint sources which overlapped
with the spectrum for GJ 1132. Hence we split these
data into individual up-the-ramp reads and performed
the extraction on these to remove the signal from these
secondary sources which could impact the shorter wave-
lengths of the recovered spectrum. Two example reads
from the second visit are shown in Figure 2, with the
ﬁrst order spectrum from faint source visible below the
data from GJ 1132 and the zeroth order of another star
also within the scan’s arc.

2.1.2. Light curve extraction

We extract the wavelength-dependent light-curves
taking into account of the geometric distortions caused
by the tilted detector of the WFC3/IR channel.

We obtain a white light curve, and a set of spectral
light curves. The former is obtained integrating the
full wavelength range of WFC3/G141, while the latter
are extracted using narrow band such that the resolving
power is 70 at 1.4 µm.

2.1.3. Limb darkening coeﬃcients

The limb-darkening coeﬃcients are computed using
the non-linear formula by Claret (2000), which scales
the intensity emerging from the star as:

= 1 −

ﬁls et al. 2018) with other super-Earths and sub-Neptunes.
The Earth-like, H2O and Iron mass and radius models are
from Zeng & Sasselov (2013) and Zeng et al. (2016). The
remnant core model (i.e. a planet that is highly compressed
due to once hosting a large primordial atmosphere that was
then subsequently lost) is from Mocquet et al. (2014). It is
important to note that the mass-radius models shown above
are merely illustrative as more complex set-ups are possi-
ble (e.g. Jespersen & Stevenson 2020; Mousis et al. 2020;
Modirrousta-Galian et al. 2020a). The planets listed are

2014), Kepler-414 b (Hadden & Lithwick 2014), Kepler-
102 d (Marcy et al. 2014), GJ 9827 d (Rice et al. 2019),
GJ 1214 b (Harpsøe et al. 2013),CoRoT-7 b (Dai et al. 2019),

HD 3167 c (Christiansen et al. 2017; Guilluy et al. 2021;
Mikal-Evans et al. 2021), LHS 1140 b (Ment et al. 2019),
and K2-18b (Benneke et al. 2019; Tsiaras et al. 2019; B´ezard
et al. 2020; Blain et al. 2021)

.

November 2017 with the G141 infrared grism (1.125 −
1.650 µm) of the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on
board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The obser-
vations were part of the HST proposal number 14758
led by Zach Berta-Thompson (Berta-Thompson et al.
2016), and were downloaded from the public Mikulski
Archive for Space Telescope (MAST) archive1.

Each transit observation required 4 HST orbits and
utilised the spatial scanning technique. The observa-
tions were acquired using the 256x256 sub-array, em-
ploying the SPARS10 sampling sequence with 15 up-the-
ramp reads which lead to an exposure time of 103.129 s.
The scan speed was 0.2”/s leading to a total scan length

where µ = cos(γ), and γ is the angle between the line
of sight and the emergent intensity, and ak are the limb
darkening coeﬃcients.

We calculated the ak coeﬃcients using ExoTETHyS
(Morello et al. 2020), with the stellar models from
Phoenix 2018 (Claret 2018) and the parameters in Table
1. These are given in Table 2.

2.1.4. White light-curves ﬁtting

To ﬁt the extracted white and spectral light-curves,
we consider the known time-dependent systematics in-
troduced by HST:

• long-term ‘ramp’, characterised by a linear trend

• short-term ‘ramp’, characterised by an exponential

trend.

To remove these systematics, we multiply for a normal-
isation factor nw and an instrumental corrective factor

the spectral light curves.

R(t). The former depend on the telescope observing
scanning mode, nscan
w , and when scanning direction is
upwards changes to nf or
w or to nrev
w when scanning di-
rection is downwards. R(t) is time dependent and can
be derived as

R(t) = (1 − ra(t − T0))

(cid:16)

1 − rb1e−rb2 (t−t0)(cid:17)

(2)

where t is time, T0 is the mid-transit time, t0 is the start-
ing time of each HST orbit, ra is the linear systematic
trend’s slope, rb1 and rb2 are the exponential systematic
trend’s coeﬃcients (Kreidberg et al. 2014; Tsiaras et al.
2016c,b) .

To extract the white transit light curve, F v

each visit, v, we both ﬁt the transit model multiplied

by the instrumental systematics, nscan
w(t) and
we ﬁt the systematic model R(t) on the out of transit
data, correcting the light curve and then ﬁtting again
w F v
nscan
To ﬁt the light curves we use the data presented in Ta-
ble 1, leaving as free parameters the radii ratio, Rp/R(cid:63),
and the mid transit time, Tmid. For the ﬁt we used
a Monte-Carlo Markov chain of 350000 steps with 200
walkers and 200000 burned iterations, using the emcee
Python package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). Each
light curve has been ﬁtted individually and so we ob-
tained the white light curve squared radii ratio for each
transit (Rp/R(cid:63))2
w,v. Initially, we ﬁtted the white light
curves using the formulae above and the uncertainties
per pixel, as propagated through the data reduction pro-
cess. However, it is common in HST/WFC3 data to have
additional scatter that cannot be explained by the ramp
model. For this reason, we scaled up the uncertainties in
the individual data points, for their median to match the
standard deviation of the residuals, and repeated the ﬁt-
ting Tsiaras et al. (2018) The resulted detrended white
light curves are reported in Figure 3 and the ﬁt results
are in Table 3. The Table shows that the (Rp/R(cid:63))2
w,v
are compatible under 2 σ and that the standard devi-
ation of the ﬁtting residuals for the white light curves
are signiﬁcantly higher than the photon noise. The ratio
between the standard deviation of the ﬁtting residuals
and the photon noise is reported in Table 3 as ¯σ.

2.1.5. Spectral light-curves ﬁtting

To correct for the systematics present in the spectral
light-curves of each visit, F v
λ (t), we ﬁt each curve with
a model that includes the white light curve associated,
F v

w(t):

where ra is the coeﬃcient of a wavelength-dependent
linear slope along each HST visit and nscan
is the nor-
malisation factor, that changes to nfor
λ , when the scan-
ning direction is upwards, and to nrev
λ when it is down-
wards. In the spectral light-curve ﬁtting, the only free
parameter is Rp/R(cid:63), while the other parameters are the
same as we used for the white light-curve ﬁtting. For the
ﬁt we used a Monte-Carlo Markov chain of 150000 steps
with 100 walkers and 100000 burned iterations, using
again the emcee package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013).
To check the quality of our ﬁts, we use the auto-
correlation of the residuals for each light curve using
the numpy correlate package. To determine a ‘good’
value of the auto-correlation, we generated a thousand
instances of random Gaussian noise and computed the
auto-correlation. For the number of data points in our

light curves (∼70), 85% of the time the auto-correlation
of Gaussian noise is below 0.35. For each of our spec-
tra, the auto-correlation is smaller than 0.32 (see Table
3) and thus any correlations found are consistent with
those found in Gaussian noise.

We also check the success of our ﬁt by computing the
reduced Chi-squared from the comparison between the
data and the model ( ¯χ) as well as the standard devi-
ation of the residuals with respect to the photon noise
(¯σ). The reduced Chi-square between the spectral light
curves for each visit is between 1.16 (second visit) and
1.2 (fourth visit). The averaged standard deviation of
the residuals with respect to the formal photon noise
is between 1.03 (second visit) and 2.42 (fourth visit),

and therefore the resulted post-processing total noise is
between 6% and 142% greater than the photon noise.

Then, to compare light curves obtained from diﬀerent
visits, F v
λ (t), we correct for oﬀsets by subtracting each
spectrum by the corresponding white light curve depth,
(Rp/R(cid:63))2
w,v, and adding the weighted average transit
depth of all white light-curves, (Rp/R(cid:63))2
w. Finally, we
compute the weighted average from all the transit ob-
servations, (Rp/R(cid:63))2
λ, reported in Table 4. The spectral
light curve ﬁts are shown in Figure 4 while the spectrum
obtained from each visit, and the ﬁnal average spectrum,
are shown in Figure 5.

We notice that in each spectral bin, the measurements
in each observation are generally compatible within 1σ
of the mean, as shown in Figure 5. Where data points

are not within 1σ, there are no obvious trends with the
observation number or wavelength. To assess if the ﬁve
transmission spectra obtained are statistically consis-
tent, we perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We per-
form this test by comparing the transmission spectra
two at a time, in every possible combination, to test the
null hypothesis that they come from the same distribu-
tion. We use the SciPy package (Virtanen et al. 2020)
for the computation. We conclude that we cannot reject
the null hypothesis for any of the couples because the
minimum resulting p-value is 28%.

To characterise the planetary atmosphere we use the
retrieval code TauREx33 (Al-Refaie et al. 2019), the new
version of TauREx (Waldmann et al. 2015a,b). The
code maps the atmospheric forward model parameter
space to ﬁnd the best ﬁt to the observed spectra. Tau-
REx allow us to identify absorbers in the spectrum using
line-lists from ExoMol (Tennyson et al. 2016), HITEMP
(Rothman et al. 2010a) and HITRAN (Rothman et al.
1987). To perform the retrieval we use Multinest algo-
rithm (Feroz et al. 2011; Buchner et al. 2014) to sample
the parameter space through 1500 live points and we set
the algorithm evidence tolerance to 0.5.

2.2.1. Temperature-pressure proﬁle

We simulate the planetary atmosphere assuming an
isothermal temperature-pressure proﬁle with constant
molecular abundances as a function of altitude. This
assumption is driven by the narrow wavelength range in-
vestigated in the data, that results in restricted probed
range of the planetary temperature–pressure proﬁle
(Rocchetto et al. 2016). We calculated the equilibrium
temperatures as:

Teq = T(cid:63)

(cid:19)1/2

(cid:18) R(cid:63)
2 a

(1 − A)1/4

(4)

where R(cid:63) is the stellar radius, a is the semi-major axis,
A is the Bond albedo. To keep in line with other
studies, we adopt a standard Bond albedo of A = 0.3

(Bonﬁls et al. 2018), although we are aware that the
albedo is highly sensitive to the planetary properties
and could therefore vary signiﬁcantly (e.g. Marley et al.
1999; Modirrousta-Galian et al. 2021). For the equi-
librium temperature we use Teq = 520 ± 44 K, where
the uncertainty comes from the error propagation on
the stellar parameters and the planet’s semi-major axis
from Table 1. Then for the atmospheric retrievals we
use a wide range of temperature priors from 0.5 Teq to
1.5 Teq (i.e. 260 - 780 K).

2.2.2. Atmosphere composition

For the atmosphere we use the plane-parallel approx-
imation, building 100 plane-parallel layers to uniformly
sample in log-space the pressure range from 10−4 to
106 Pa. We assumed a primary atmosphere of He and
H2 with a ﬁxed ratio between the two molecules of 0.17,
then we introduce the trace gases: H2O (Barton et al.
2017; Polyansky et al. 2018), CH4 (Hill et al. 2013;
Yurchenko & Tennyson 2014), CO (Li et al. 2015), CO2
(Rothman et al. 2010b), HCN (Barber et al. 2014) and
NH3 (Yurchenko et al. 2011). To perform the atmo-
spheric ﬁt we use as boundaries for each molecule 10−12
and 10−1 in volume mixing ratios (log-uniform prior).
To ﬁt the planet atmosphere we used two models: one
with all the molecules listed above molecules and a sec-
ond which also included N2 (Western et al. 2018). In fact
N2 is a largely inactive gas over the spectral range con-
sidered and its only contribution is to the atmospheric
mean molecular weight. Using such distinction between
the two models we are considering a light, primary at-
mosphere while also exploring the potential for heavy,
secondary atmosphere. We note that, as the abundances
of all molecules was allowed to extend to 1 (i.e. 100%),
the retrieval without N2 is also capable of resulting in a
high mean molecular weight atmosphere.

Additionally, we include in all our models Rayleigh
scattering and collision induced absorption of H2–H2
(Abel et al. 2011; Fletcher et al. 2018) and H2–He (Abel
et al. 2012). Clouds are modeled assuming a grey opac-
ity model and cloud top pressure bounds are set between
10−2 and 106 Pa. We also set a large range of priors for
the planetary radius, from 0.5 Rp to 1.4 Rp referring to
the literature value reported in Table 1. The planetary
radius is assumed to be equivalent at 106 Pa pressure.

To assign a signiﬁcance to our detection, we use the
Bayes Factor between the nominal atmospheric model
and a model which contains no active trace gases,
Rayleigh scattering or collision induced absorption. We
perform a retrieval where no molecular absorbers are
active which provides a ﬂat line model to test the sig-
niﬁcance of retrievals including molecular opacities.

9

sphere to that of single molecule retrievals where the abun-
dance of said molecule was ﬁxed and no clouds were included.
In each case, the cloudy model is preferred to >5σ.

3. RESULTS

The ﬁnal spectrum recovered is extremely ﬂat, with
few deviations from a ﬂat line. Nevertheless, we con-
ducted retrievals to explore the possibility that any of
these minor features could be attributed to molecular
species. While formation and evolution theories suggest
a hydrogen dominated atmosphere is unlikely for this
planet, we started by exploring this possibility. Our ini-
tial retrieval, conducted with a hydrogen-dominated at-
mosphere containing clouds and the molecules discussed
in Section 2.2, found no evidence of features. The re-
trieval including N2 came to similar results, with the
spectrum essentially being ﬁtted by a grey cloud deck
alone in both cases. The Bayesian evidence for each
retrieval, log(E) = 218.44 and log(E) = 218.38 for re-
trievals with and without N2 respectively, shows that
the cloud only model (log(E) = 218.52) provides the
best ﬁt to the data.

To better show the noncompliance of our data
with molecular features, we performed retrievals for
clear hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with only one
molecule which was forced to mixing ratios from 10−6
to 10−1. The latter is set as a rough boundary be-
tween primary and secondary atmospheres (i.e. a mean
molecular weight >> 2.3). We use the Bayesian evi-
dence from these retrievals, given in Figure 6, to rule
them out to a given signiﬁcance. We ran these for H2O,
NH3, CO, CO2, CH4 and HCN and, in every case, the
cloud only model provided a better ﬁt to the data to
>5σ. Hence, our results suggest we can rule out a clear,
primary atmosphere with high conﬁdence: if GJ 1132 b
one dominated by
hosts a primary atmosphere (i.e.

models. The cloud only model (i.e. a ﬂat line) still provides
the best-ﬁt to the spectrum obtained.

hydrogen and helium), according to our spectrum, the
planet must be completely overcast.

We also attempted to ﬁt several models with sec-
ondary atmospheric compositions.
These were at-
mospheres composed entirely of H2O and CO2 (i.e.
VMRH2O = 1 and VMRCO2 = 1), as well as an atmo-
sphere similar to that of Venus (with volume mixing
ratios of VMRCO2 = 0.965, VMRH2O = 2e-5, VMRCO
= 1.7e-5, VMRSO2 = 1.5e-4). For each of these, a
cloud-free atmosphere was assumed and the molecular
abundances were again ﬁxed. Thus, the only free pa-
rameters were the planet radius and the temperature.
The best-ﬁt spectrum in each case is given in Figure
7 although with the Bayesian evidence for each setup.
Again, the best ﬁtting model is that of a ﬂat line, with
a cloud free, 100% H2O atmosphere being ruled out to
>3 sigma. However, while providing worse ﬁts to the
data than the cloud-only model, the clear, 100% CO2
and Venusian atmosphere models cannot be deﬁnitively
ruled out with the current dataset.

Hence, no evidence for molecular features could be ex-
tracted from this dataset. For completeness we include
the posterior distribution for our baseline retrieval in
Figure 8. Our results suggest that the atmosphere of
GJ 1132 b is likely to be cloudy but that certain enriched
atmospheres, with small scale-heights that led to only
minor features over the HST WFC3 range, could also
explain the data. A ﬁnal possibility, which is compati-
ble with our spectrum, is that the planet hosts an atmo-
sphere too thin to be detected and that we are measuring
the transit depth caused by the planet’s solid surface.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Statistical goodness of ﬁt analysis

Due to the absence of molecular features in the mea-
sured spectrum, we statistically compare the data re-

ported in Table 4 with a constant value deﬁned as the
weighted average of the planetary-to-stellar radii ratios.
By using chi squared statistics, we obtain χ2 = 26 with
ν = 25 − 1 = 24 degrees of freedom. The obtained re-
duced chi squared value is χ2
ν = 26/24 = 1.08, with an
uncertainty of σχ2
ν ∼ 1, we cannot
exclude the possibility that the measured data comes
from a constant distribution as the ﬂat line is a good
model to describe the data. Therefore, the collected
data does indeed show no detectable molecular features.
Because we compare diﬀerent observations to obtain
the spectrum in Table 4, we perform a Jack-knife anal-
ysis (Quenouille 1949, 1956; Tukey 1958). This consists
of taking the original dataset, X, which is composed
of n samples, and creating n new datasets, xi. Each

new dataset is like the original except that it has n − 1
samples. The removed sample is diﬀerent for each new
dataset so that no two are identical. In our case we have
5 observations so n = 5. For each of these new samples
we compute the average spectrum, as described in sec
2.1.5, and then we compare it with its weighted average
value, ˆxi. In an identical manner as before, we make use
of the reduced chi squared value χ2
ν as a metric for the
goodness of the ﬁt. The results are reported in Tab. 5.
All of our χ2
ν are ∼ 1 indicating a very good ﬁt. This
conﬁrms our results and demonstrates that we are not
biased in our analysis.

We also computed the Jack-knife bias as bias = (n −
1)( ˆX − ˆx) = 3e − 7, where ˆX is the average radii ra-
tio computed from the X sample, and ˆx is the average

4.2. The Physical Implications of our Results

As explained previously, from mass and radius mea-
surements it is not always possible to accurately deter-
mine the bulk composition of an exoplanet. However,
there are a few clues that could help us evaluate whether
GJ 1132 b could have a hydrogen atmosphere or not.
Speciﬁcally, one could consider the eﬀects of X-ray and
ultraviolet (XUV) irradiation from the host star and its
eﬀects on a primordial atmosphere. Performing a back-
wards reconstruction of the maximum amount of hydro-
gen that could be lost by XUV irradiation is beyond the
scope of this study, but it is worth discussing.

Consider for example the super-Earth GJ 357 b. Hav-
ing a mass, radius, and temperature of (cid:39) 1.84M⊕, (cid:39)
1.22R⊕, and (cid:39) 500 K (Luque et al. 2019), respectively,
its properties are relatively similar to those of GJ 1132 b.
However, what makes GJ 357 b unique is that it or-
bits a very low active M-type star (Modirrousta-Galian
et al. 2020b).
In spite of the abnormally low XUV
levels, a careful backwards evaporation reconstruction
model shows that up to ∼ 38 M⊕ of hydrogen could
have been lost (Modirrousta-Galian et al. 2020b). Al-
though GJ 357 b was probably born with a hydro-
gen envelope signiﬁcantly smaller than this (perhaps
Matm (cid:46) 0.02 M⊕ Ikoma & Hori (2012); Chachan &
Stevenson (2018)), this calculation shows that even stars
with very low activity levels could completely strip oﬀ
the primordial atmosphere of a planet. While the activ-
ity level of GJ 1132 is not known, statistically speaking it
is most probably higher than that of GJ 357 b (e.g. Penz
& Micela 2008; Sanz-Forcada et al. 2011), so by compar-
ison one can infer that GJ 1132 b most probably lost its

11

hydrogen envelope. Of course, other eﬀects such as mag-
netism (e.g. Matsakos et al. 2015), magma-atmosphere
exchanges (e.g. Chachan & Stevenson 2018), and mi-
gration (e.g. Nayakshin & Lodato 2012) may have low-
ered the evaporation rates, but large mass-losses would
be expected nonetheless. Therefore, based on the mass-
radius of GJ 1132 b, our current understanding of XUV-
induced evaporation, and our spectroscopic results, a
strong argument can be made that GJ 1132 b is a tel-
luric body lacking a primordial envelope that instead
might host a secondary atmosphere. However, we do
acknowledge that other setups are plausible. For in-
stance, GJ 1132 b could be an airless rocky planet (e.g.
Modirrousta-Galian et al. 2021) or a rocky planet with-
out clouds but an atmosphere that is too thin to be
detected in these data. Notwithstanding, these conﬁgu-
rations may be less probable given that geological out-
gassing is expected to generate thick secondary atmo-
spheres with clouds (Kite et al. 2009; Noack et al. 2017;
Dorn et al. 2018).

4.3. Comparison with previous works

To compare our measurements with previous works
we adopt the radii ratios published in recent papers. We
use the measurements from Table 3 of Dittmann et al.
(2017) and Table 6 of Diamond-Lowe et al. (2018), and
we compute the (Rp/R(cid:63))2 from them, where needed.
Additionally, GJ 1132 b has also been studied by TESS
and we used the pipeline from Edwards et al. (2020b)
to download, clean and ﬁt the 2 minute cadence Pre-
search Data Conditioning (PDC) light curves (Smith
et al. 2012; Stumpe et al. 2012, 2014). Then we report
all the data in Table 6 and in Figure 9.

While it has become common to combine data from
diﬀerent instruments there may be an oﬀset between the
datasets. These oﬀsets can occur due to imperfect cor-
rection of instrument systematics, from the use of dif-
ferent orbital parameters or limb darkening coeﬃcients
during the light curve ﬁtting or from stellar variability
or activity (e.g. Stevenson et al. 2014a; Morello et al.
2017; Stevenson et al. 2014b; Tsiaras et al. 2018; Yip
et al. 2020; Bruno et al. 2020; Pluriel et al. 2020; Mur-
gas et al. 2020; Changeat et al. 2020; Yip et al. 2021;
Schlawin et al. 2021). As there is no wavelength over-
lap between our HST observations and the ground-based
data we cannot be certain of the compatibility of the ob-
servations.

The transit depth from the TESS data agrees with
the data from Diamond-Lowe et al. (2018) (see Figure
9). Nevertheless, while the datasets could potentially
be compatible, we err on the side of caution and do not
perform a joint ﬁt. We note that the study by Diamond-

12

Figure 9. Transit depths from various studies on GJ 1132 b,
as listed in Table 6, and the spectrum recovered in this work.
Also plotted are forward models which assume a clear H/He
atmosphere with various molecules, each at an abundance
of volume mixing ratios of 10−3. We note that we do not
directly compare the models to the combined dataset due to
the possibility of incompatibilities between them.

Lowe et al. (2018) also concluded that GJ 1132 b could
not have a clear, primordial envelope and thus the stud-
ies are in agreement on this conclusion. Additionally,
the Spitzer transit from Dittmann et al. (2017) exhibits
a similar transit depth to ours, but again we do not in-
clude it in a joint ﬁt. Finally, we note that Southworth
et al. (2017) claimed the detection of an atmosphere
due to the modulation of several ground-based photo-
metric measurements but, given the precision obtained
in Diamond-Lowe et al. (2018) was higher than in said
study, we do not include it in our plots.

During the review process of this paper, an indepen-
dent study also analysed the same HST WFC3 data of
GJ 1132 b. Swain et al. (2021) found evidence for a slope
over this wavelength region, attributed to an H2 dom-
inated atmosphere with hazes, as well as spectral fea-
tures that were proposed to be due to absorption by
CH4 and HCN. Their work suggested GJ 1132 b had lost
its primordial envelope and gained a second atmosphere
through volcanic processes that released H2 captured in
the early age.

As our extracted spectrum diﬀers greatly from that
of Swain et al. (2021), we conducted an independent
analysis of the datasets with an additional open-source

Table 6. Collection of transit depths of GJ 1132 b from other
instruments. Data from Dittmann et al. (2017) are from
Table 3 and for Diamond-Lowe et al. (2018) we use data
from Table 6.

produced by the CALWFC3 data reduction pipeline
(note that Iralcis takes the raw data and applies calibra-
tion steps itself). CASCADe implements a novel data
driven method, pioneered by Sch¨olkopf et al. (2016),
utilising the causal connections within a data set to
calibrate the spectral time-series data. For a full de-
scription of the pipeline steps, we refer the reader to
(Carone et al. 2021).

We ran CASCADe using the same planet parameters
and limb darkening coeﬃcients as discussed in Section
2.1. A comparison between these spectra, and to that
obtained by Swain et al. (2021), is given in Figure 10.
We immediately notice a vertical oﬀset in the spectra
obtained by Iraclis and CASCADe. The oﬀset is likely
to be caused by diﬀerences in the correction of the sys-
tematics and such oﬀsets between diﬀerent pipelines has
been seen before, for example for WASP-117 b (Anis-
man et al. 2020; Carone et al. 2021) and KELT-11 b
(Changeat et al. 2020; Col´on et al. 2020). The ﬁnding of
this oﬀset provides further evidence that combining in-
struments without wavelength overlap is dangerous (Yip
et al. 2020, 2021)

Despite this oﬀset, we note that the spectral features
in the CASCADe spectrum, or lack thereof, are highly
similar to those obtained with Iraclis. By subtracting
the mean from each spectrum, we show that the recov-
ered data points are all within 1σ. Comparing these to
Swain et al. (2021), we clearly highlight the disparity be-
tween our study and theirs: whereas they uncover spec-
tral variations of ±200 ppm from the mean transit depth,
both our pipelines yield spectra where 21 of the 25 data
points (84%) lie within ±50 ppm of the mean transit
depth, with no data points being more than 75 ppm from
the mean.

The exact cause of the diﬀerence in the recovered
transmission spectra between this study and that of
Swain et al. (2021) is hard to discern without detailed
Ira-
one to one comparisons of the pipelines utilised.
clis and CASCADe are both open-source, well-used and
have been validated against other results within the lit-
erature. Additionally, their approach to the data cali-
bration and reduction, especially in the ﬁtting of the sys-
tematic trends that are encountered within HST WFC3
data, are utterly diﬀerent and so achieving almost iden-
tical spectra with these pipelines leads us to have conﬁ-
dence in our results. Our team is working closely with
those from Swain et al. (2021) to resolve the discrepancy
between our work and theirs.

4.4. Future missions

Future missions will oﬀer increased sensitivity and
wider spectral coverage. This will be key in the hunt
for atmospheric features on smaller planets. While
Ariel will be able to characterise H/He dominated at-
mospheres (Edwards et al. 2019), or rule out their pres-
ence on small worlds, it may struggle to provide ad-
ditional constraints on GJ 1132 b given its lack of a
clear H/He atmosphere and spectral features. Hence,
we focus on JWST and show in Figure 11 the data
that could be obtained from 1 single transit with either

Figure 10. Comparison of the results from the data reduc-
tion and spectrum extraction undertaken here using Iraclis
and CASCADe. While there is an oﬀset between the spectra,
normalising them by their mean transit depth shows they are
consistent to within 1σ. However, the spectra recovered with
both pipelines here diﬀers signiﬁcantly to that from Swain
et al. (2021).

NIRISS GR700XD or NIRSpec G395M, modelled using
ExoWebb, an adapted version of the Terminus tool de-
scribed in Edwards & Stotesbury (2021) which uses the
Pandeia engine (Pontoppidan et al. 2016). The coloured
regions show the 1σ errors on the observation which has
been binned to R∼50 and, as they can rarely be distin-
guished, this suggests that even JWST may struggle to
disentangle diﬀerent atmospheric types or provide signif-
icant evidence for molecular features. With the excep-
tion of the Venus-like case, the forward models assume a
H/He envelope with the addition of the stated molecule.

5. CONCLUSION

We present the data analysis of ﬁve spectroscopic ob-
servations of GJ 1132 b obtained with the G141 grism of
the WFC3 onboard of the HST. We extracted the plan-
etary transmission spectra with Iraclis pipeline and we
attempted to retrieve the atmospheric composition using
TauREx3. Our ﬁndings agree with those of Diamond-
Lowe et al. (2018) and the transmission spectrum we
obtain from our data shows no molecular features in
the investigated wavelength range. We compared the
spectrum with diﬀerent atmospheric types to verify the
non compliance with any molecular content at the data
precision and we concluded that is compatible with a
ﬂat transmission spectrum only. Future astronomical
missions, such as JWST, will help further constrain the
atmospheric properties of GJ 1132 b although multiple
observations may be required for spectral features to be
discerned. While it may be diﬃcult to understand its
true nature, GJ 1132 b remains an interesting candidate
for future atmospheric studies.
