The success of the ambitious programs of both long- and short-baseline neutrino-oscillation ex-
periments employing liquid-argon time-projection chambers will greatly rely on the precision with
which the weak response of the argon nucleus can be estimated. In the E12-14-012 experiment at
Jeﬀerson Lab Hall A, we studied the properties of the argon nucleus by scattering a high-quality
electron beam oﬀ a high-pressure gaseous argon target. Here, we present the measured 40Ar(e, e(cid:48))
double diﬀerential cross section at incident electron energy E = 2.222 GeV and scattering angle
θ = 15.54◦. The data cover a broad range of energy transfers, where quasielastic scattering and
delta production are the dominant reaction mechanisms. The result for argon is compared to our
previously reported cross sections for titanium and carbon, obtained in the same kinematical setup.

Precise determination of charge-parity (CP) symmetry
violation in the lepton sector—necessary to shed light
on the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe—
is among the highest priorities of particle physics. Over
the next two decades, this issue will be a primary sci-
ence goal of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment
(DUNE) [1], together with a search for proton decay,
measurement of the electron-neutrino ﬂux from a core-
collapse supernova—should one occur in our galaxy dur-
ing the lifetime of DUNE—and search for physics beyond
the standard model.

In the next few years, the Short-Baseline Neutrino
(SBN) program [2] at Fermilab will provide a deﬁnitive

answer to the question of the existence of sterile neu-
trinos, which could be the source of electron-like events
recently reported with statistical signiﬁcance 4.8σ by the
MiniBooNE Collaboration [3].

Both DUNE and the SBN program (will) employ
liquid-argon time-projection chambers as their detectors,
the advantages of which are low threshold momenta for
particle detection and high spatial resolution, allowing
(among others) for precise neutrino-energy reconstruc-
tion and distinguishing photons from electrons. As a
consequence, the success of both programs in studying
neutrino oscillations with unprecedented precision will
greatly rely on the precision with which we understand

the complexity of nuclear eﬀects in argon and the preci-
sion with which we are able to estimate its response to
electroweak probes.

It is important to realize that, although the near detec-
tor facilities of DUNE will play a fundamental role in the
reduction of systematic uncertainties, alone they will not
be suﬃcient to determine the cross sections with the pre-
cision necessary to achieve the objectives of DUNE [4].
At beam energies in the few-GeV region, the observed
event kinematics cannot be readily translated to the true
value of neutrino energy, owing to detector eﬀects, and
the procedure of energy reconstruction heavily relies on
the nuclear model used in Monte Carlo (MC) simula-
tions [5]. Even for functionally identical near and far de-
tectors, the spectrum reconstructed in the near detector
is very diﬀerent from the one in the far detector. This is
a consequence not only of neutrino oscillations, but also
of diﬀerences in particle containment and angular accep-
tance, and of the strong angular dependence of the ﬂux,
which makes important the diﬀerence between the solid
angle probed by near and far detectors, even in the ab-
sence of the oscillations. As the CP-violation sensitivity
of DUNE critically depends on systematic uncertainties,
even their modest reduction has a meaningful impact on
the running time necessary to achieve the physics objec-
tives.

In the ongoing oscillation experiments [6, 7], the un-
certainties related to nuclear eﬀects in neutrino-nucleus
interactions have become one of the major sources of
systematics [8, 9], despite extensive use of near-detector
data to constrain the nuclear models employed in MC
simulations. As diﬀerent probe’s energies and reaction
mechanisms are intertwined in neutrino-scattering data,
it is diﬃcult to identify, diagnose, and remedy poten-
tial shortcomings of nuclear models. However, electron-
scattering measurements with targets and kinematics of
interest to neutrino experiments give an excellent oppor-
tunity to validate and improve the description of nuclear
eﬀects [10]. Considering that there is a large body of
electron-scattering data available for carbon (and lim-
ited availability of data for oxygen) the situation for ar-
gon is woefully inadequate, with only one dataset cur-
rently available: the inclusive electron-scattering spec-
trum measured at Frascati National Laboratory (LNF)
using the electron-positron collider ADONE and a jet
target at incident electron energy E=700 MeV and scat-
tering angle θ = 32◦ [11]. Argon can be expected to be
more challenging to describe than oxygen and carbon, as
a signiﬁcantly heavier nucleus that is additionally isospin
asymmetric. This asymmetry is of fundamental impor-
tance for the CP-violation measurement in DUNE, to be
based on analysis of the diﬀerence between the neutrino
and antineutrino event distributions. Availability of a
new precise dataset for electron scattering oﬀ argon is
therefore vital, in order to provide a testbed and stimu-
late further development of theoretical models of nuclear

response to electroweak interactions [12–21] in the kine-
matic region of interest to neutrino experiments.

To address this issue, we performed a dedicated ex-
periment at Jeﬀerson Lab (JLab) to study electron scat-
tering from argon and titanium nuclei [22]. The experi-
ment, E12-14-012, collected high statistics data in JLab
Hall A during February and March 2017. We recently re-
ported Ti(e, e(cid:48))X and C(e, e(cid:48))X cross section results [23].
Here, we present the ﬁrst argon results of the experiment,
Ar(e, e(cid:48))X cross section at beam energy E = 2.222 GeV
and electron scattering angle θ = 15.54◦, and its compar-
ison with our previously reported cross sections for the
titanium and carbon nuclei in the same kinematics [23].

position of the beam, the latter being critical for vertex
reconstruction and momentum calculation of scattered
electrons, were monitored by resonant radio-frequency
cavities (beam current monitors or BCMs) and cavities
with four antennas (beam position monitors or BPMs),
respectively. Harp scanners, which moved a thin wire
through the beam, were used to measure its size. To
eliminate the possibility of overheating the target by the
deposited beam energy, the beam was rastered with a
2 mm2 raster system, to increase the eﬀective spot

size and reduce the energy density.

The gaseous argon target, with a thickness of
0.005 g/cm2, was contained in a 25 cm long cell
1.455
with thin aluminum entry and exit windows of respec-
tively 0.25 and 0.28 mm thickness. To account for the
background contribution from electrons scattered from
the wall of the argon target cell measurements were also
performed on a dummy target, aluminum foils mounted
on separate frames located at positions corresponding to
the entry and exit windows of the cell. The thickness of

The scattered electrons were detected in the Left

In the acceptance-correction method, for each bin in

∆E∆Ω, the cross section is obtained as

d2σ/dΩdE(cid:48) = Y (E(cid:48), θ)/[(∆E∆Ω)A(E(cid:48), θ)L].

where, Y (E(cid:48), θ) and A(E(cid:48), θ) are yield and acceptance for
a given bin, respectively, and L is the integrated lumi-
nosity obtained using MC and validated with the solid
Al target (dummy cell) and C foils (the optics target).
In the yield-ratio method, the cross section for each bin
is computed as the product of the MC cross section [27]
times the ratio of the data to simulation yields

The MC cross section is a ﬁt to the existing data includ-
ing preliminary Hall C data [28]. The MC includes the
radiative corrections computed using the peaking approx-
imation [29] and Coulomb corrections implemented with
an eﬀective momentum approximation [30], further ac-
counting for the change in radiation length of the target
due to the target-boiling eﬀect.

Figure 1 shows the measured Ar(e, e(cid:48)) double diﬀer-
ential cross section as a function of the energy of the
scattered electron, E(cid:48), extracted with the yield-ratio and
the acceptance-correction methods. Both methods yield
the cross-section results in very good agreement, with
marginal diﬀerences observed only in the region of E(cid:48)
above the quasielastic peak (i.e. ω below the peak),
where the event statistics are limited and the systematic
uncertainties of the acceptance method are larger. The
primary diﬀerence between the two methods is the fact
that the yield-ratio method relies more on the predictions
of the cross section model in the MC but the agreement
of the two methods strengthens our conﬁdence in both
procedures. The measured cross section covers a broad
1.3 to
range of scattered electron energy ranging from
2.2 GeV. The kinematical coverage includes both the
∼
quasielastic and delta-production peaks, and further ex-
tends to the deep-inelastic scattering region. The total
uncertainties remain below
4.0% corresponding to the

statistical (1.7–2.9%) and the systematic (1.8–3.0%) un-
certainties summed in quadrature. A detailed list of the
uncertainties is given in Table I.

Green’s function. Final-state interactions are accounted
for, consistent with the approach used in the exclusive

but the formalism translates the ﬂux lost towards inelas-

ing our experiment, aimed at exploiting titanium data to
extract complementary information on nuclear eﬀects in
argon. However, the diﬀerences between the results for
argon and carbon indicate signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the

vant in the context of MC simulations for DUNE.

FIG. 3. (color online). Comparison between the scaling func-
tion of the second kind, f (ψ), obtained from E12-14-012 data
on Ar, Ti, and C. The kF of C is ﬁxed to the value obtained
by Moniz et al. [35] while the data analysis of Ti and Ar sets
kF at 240 and 245 MeV, respectively. The circles are the Ar
data from LNF [11], which turn out to prefer an inconsistently
higher value of kF .

Inclusive data corresponding to diﬀerent kinematics
and diﬀerent targets are best compared in terms of the
scaling functions of the ﬁrst and second kinds, discussed
in Refs. [33] and [34], respectively. Scaling of the ﬁrst
kind, or y-scaling, is observed in the regime in which
quasielastic single-nucleon knockout is the dominant re-
action mechanism, and the eﬀect of ﬁnal state interac-
tions between the struck nucleon and the spectator sys-
tem is negligible. The resulting scaling function, F (y), is
determined by the target spectral function, and turns out
to be largely independent of kinematics. Scaling of the
second kind, however, allows to compare data sets cor-
responding to diﬀerent targets. The deﬁnitions of both
the scaling variable ψ and the scaling function f (ψ) in-
volve a momentum scale, which can be loosely interpreted
as a nuclear Fermi momentum, kF , providing a simple
parametrization of the target dependence of nuclear ef-
fects.

In Fig. 3, we show the scaling functions of the second
kind, f (ψ), displayed as a function of the dimensionless
scaling variable ψ.
It is apparent that setting the car-
bon Fermi momentum to 220 MeV—the value resulting
from the analysis of Moniz et al. [35]—the scaling of ti-
tanium and argon data is observed for kF = 240 and
245 MeV, respectively. Hence, the scaling analysis con-

reactions. It is apparent that this procedure leads to a
remarkably good description of both shape and normal-
ization of the data in the the quasielastic region. How-
ever, it does not include two-body currents and delta-
excitation mechanisms which are clearly visible in the
region of lower E(cid:48) values (i.e. larger energy transfers).

In Fig. 2, we compare the argon data to the titanium
and carbon data of Ref. [23], taken in the same kine-
matical setup, corresponding to incident electron energy
2.222 GeV and scattering angle of 15.54◦. The compari-
son is performed in terms of the ratio deﬁned as

where A and Z are the nuclear mass number and

ﬁrms the picture emerging from Fig. 2. For comparison,
we also show the scaling function f (ψ) obtained using the
Ar(e, e(cid:48)) cross section at 700 MeV and 32◦, measured at
the LNF electron-positron storage ring ADONE using a
jet target [11]. It turns out that the LNF data only scale
at ψ
0, and prefer a value of the Fermi momentum,
kF =375 MeV, much larger than that resulting from the
analysis of JLab data. This inconsistency may well be
the result of the normalization issue that the authors of
Ref. [11] found in their 16O cross section, as compared to
the cross sections previously measured at the Bates Lin-
ear Accelerator Center [36], chosen as a reference dataset.
A normalization factor of 1.19 had to be applied to the
LNF 16O cross section in order to reproduce the Bates
spectrum [11]. Note that the Bates data for oxygen were
obtained by subtracting cross sections corresponding to
BeO and Be targets, while the LNF experiment used a
relatively pure jet target. The same normalization factor,
1.19, was then applied to the reported argon cross sec-
tion, leaving room for further uncertainty. In addition,
it has to be pointed out that the results of RGF calcu-
lations, while describing both the LNF oxygen data [31]
and the E12-14-012 argon data in the quasielastic region
(see Fig. 1), show the same normalization problem with
the LNF argon data.

The pattern observed in Figs.2 and 3 is also consistent
with the results of Fig. 4, showing the scaling functions of
the ﬁrst kind, F (y), obtained from the argon, titanium,
and carbon cross section measured by the E12-14-012 col-
laboration, and from the argon cross section of Ref.[11].

precise measurement on the argon nucleus will be of great
value for the development of realistic models of the elec-
troweak response of neutron-rich nuclei, vital for the suc-
cess of the current and next generation of neutrino oscil-
