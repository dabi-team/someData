The scattering of electrons on carbon, calcium, and argon targets are analyzed

using an approach that incorporates the contributions to the electromagnetic re-

sponse functions from the quasielastic (QE), inelastic processes, and two-particle

and two-hole meson exchange current (2p-2h MEC). This approach describes well

the whole energy spectrum of data at very diﬀerent kinematics. It is shown that

the accuracy of the (e, e′) cross section calculations in the region between the QE

and delta-resonance peaks, where the 2p-2h MEC contribution reaches its maximum

value, depends on the momentum transfer |q| and at |q| > 500 MeV the calculated

and measured cross sections are in agreement within the experimental uncertainties.

INTRODUCTION

The current [1, 2] and future [3, 4] long-baseline neutrino experiments aim at measuring

the lepton CP violation phase, improving the accuracy of the value of the mixing angle

θ23, and determing neutrino mass ordering. To evaluate the oscillation parameters, the

probabilities of neutrino oscillations as functions of neutrino energy are measured. The

neutrino beams are not monoenergetic and have broad distributions that range from tens of

MeVs to a few GeVs. This is one of the problems in achieving a high level of accuracy of

the oscillation parameters measurements.

In this energy range, charged-current (CC) quasielastic (QE) scattering induced by both

one- and two-body currents and resonance production are the main contributions to the

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

neutrino-nucleus scattering. The incident neutrino energy is reconstructed using calori-

metric methods, which rely not only on the visible energy measured in the detector, but

also on the models of the neutrino-nucleus interactions that are implemented in neutrino

event generators. In addition to its role in the reconstruction of the neutrino energy, the

neutrino-nucleus scattering model is critical for obtain background estimates, and for cor-

rect extrapolations of the near detector constraints to the far detector in analyses aimed at

determing the neutrino oscillation parameters.

The modeling of neutrino-nucleus interactions in the energy range εν ≈ 0.2–5 GeV is one

of the most complicated issues facing neutrino oscillation experiments. The description of

nuclear eﬀects is one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainties despite use of the

near detector for tuning the nuclear models employed in the neutrino events generator. A

signiﬁcant systematic uncertainty arises from the description of scattering induced by the

two body meson exchange currents (MEC), which may produce two-particle and two-hole

ﬁnal states. Such excitations are induced by two-body currents, hence, they go beyond the

impulse approximation scheme in which the probe interacts with only a single nucleon and

corresponds to the 1p-1h excitations. A poor modelling of these MEC processes leads to a

bias in the reconstruction of neutrino energy and thereby to large systematic uncertainties

in the neutrino oscillation parameters [5].

In recent years many studies have been presented to improve our knowledge on lepton-

nucleus scattering [6–10, 12–28]. Approaches which go beyond the impulse approximation

were developed in Refs. [11–15, 19, 20, 22, 23, 26]. As neutrino beams have broad energy

distributions, various contributions to the cross sections can signiﬁcantly overlap with each

other making it diﬃcult to identify, diagnose and remedy shortcoming of nuclear models.

On the other hand, in electron-scattering the energy and momentum transfer are known

and therefore measurements in kinematic ranges and on targets of interest to neutrino ex-

periments give an opportunity to validate and improve the description of nuclear eﬀects.

Electron beams can be used to investigate physics corresponding to diﬀerent interaction

mechanisms, by measuring the nuclear response at energy transfers varied independently

from three-momentum transfer. The neutrino detectors are typically composed of scintilla-

tor, water, or argon. There is a large body of electron-scattering data on carbon and calcium

and only a few data sets available for scattering on argon.

Weak interactions of neutrino probe the nucleus in a similar way as electromagnetic elec-

3

tron interactions. The vector part of the electroweak interaction can be inferred directly from

electron-scattering and the inﬂuence of nuclear medium is the same as in neutrino-nucleus

scattering. Precise electron-scattering data give unique opportunity to validate nuclear

model employed in neutrino physics. A model unable to reproduce electron measurements

cannot be expected to provide accurate predictions for neutrino cross sections. So, the de-

tailed comparison with electron scattering data (semi-inclusive and inclusive cross sections

and response functions) is a necessary test for any theoretical models used to describe of the

lepton-nucleus interaction.

In this work we test a joint calculation of the QE, 2p-2h MEC, and inelastic scattering

contributions (RDWIA+MEC+RES approach) on carbon, calcium, and argon, using the rel-

ativistic distorted-wave impulse approximation (RDWIA) [29–31] for quasi-elastic response

and meson exchange currents response functions for 2p-2h ﬁnal states presented in Ref.[16].

For calculation of inelastic contributions to the cross sections we adopt parameterizations for

the single-nucleon inelastic structure functions given in Refs.[32, 33], which provide a good

description of the resonant structure in (e, e′) cross sections and cover a wide kinematic

region. We compare the RDWIA+MEC+RES predictions with the whole energy spectrum

of (e, e′) data, including the recent JLab data for electron scattering on carbon and argon.

We also perform a comparison and analysis of the calculated cross sections and data at the

momentum transfer that corresponds to the region between the QE and ∆-resonance peak,

where the 2p-2h response is peaked.

In Sec.II we briﬂy introduce the formalism needed for studying electron scattering oﬀ

nuclei with quasielastic, 2p-2h MEC, and resonance production contributions. We also

describe briﬂy the basic aspects of the models used for the calculations. The results are

presented and discussed in Sec.III. Our conclusions are summarized in Sec.IV.

II. FORMALISM OF ELECTRON-NUCLEUS SCATTERING, RDWIA, 2p-2h

MEC, AND INELASTIC RESPONSES

We consider the inclusive electron-nucleus scattering

e(ki) + A(pA) → e′(kf ) + X

(1)

4

in the one-photon exchange approximation. Here ki = (εi, ki) and kf = (εf , kf ) are the

initial and ﬁnal lepton momenta, pA = (εA, pA) is the initial target momentum, q = (ω, q)
is the momentum transfer carried by the virtual photon, and Q2 = −q2 = q2 − ω2 is the

photon virtuality.

A. Electron-nucleus cross sections

In the inclusive reactions (1) only the outgoing lepton is detected and the diﬀerential

cross section can be written as

d3σ
dεf dΩf

=

α2
Q4 LµνW µν,

(2)

where Ωf = (θ, φ) is the solid angle for the electron momentum, α ≈ 1/137 is the ﬁne-
structure constant, Lµν is the lepton tensor, and W µν is the electromagnetic nuclear tensor.

In terms of the longitudinal RL and transverse RT nuclear response functions the cross

section reduces to

and depend on the variables (Q2, ω) or (|q|, ω). They describe the electromagnetic properties

of the hadronic system. The relations between the response functions and cross sections for

longitudinally σL and transversely σT polarized virtual photons are

where K = ω − Q2/2m is the equivalent energy of a real photon needed to produce the same

ﬁnal mass state and m is the mass of nucleon.

All the nuclear structure information and ﬁnal state interaction eﬀects (FSI) are contained

in the electromagnetic nuclear tensor. It is given by expression

Wµν =

hX|Jµ|AihA|J †

ν|Xi,

Xf

(8)

were Jµ is the nuclear electromagnetic current operator that connects the initial nucleus

state |Ai and the ﬁnal state |Xi. The sum is taken over the scattering states corresponding

to all of allowed asymptotic conﬁgurations. This equation is very general and includes all

possible channels. Thus, the hadron tensor can be expanded as the sum of the 1p-1h and

2p-2h, plus additional channels, including the inelastic electron-nucleus scattering Win:

W µν = W µν

1p1h + W µν

2p2h + W µν

in · · ·

(9)

The hadronic tensors W1p1h, W2p2h, and Win determine, correspondingly, the QE, 2p-2h

MEC, and inelastic response functions. Therefore, the functions Ri in Eq.(6) can be written

as a sum of the QE (Ri,QE), MEC (Ri,M EC), and inelastic response functions (Ri,in)

Ri = Ri,QE + Ri,M EC + Ri,in

(10)

B. Model

We describe genuine QE electron-nuclear scattering within the RDWIA approach. This

formalism is entirely based on the impulse approximation, namely one body currents. In

this approximation the nuclear current is written as a sum of single-nucleon currents and

nuclear matrix element in Eq. (8) takes the form

hp, B|J µ|Ai =

Z

d3r exp(it · r)Ψ

(−)

(p, r)ΓµΦ(r),

(11)

where Γµ is the vertex function, t = εBq/W is the recoil-corrected momentum transfer,
(mA + ω)2 − q2 is the invariant mass and Φ and Ψ(−) are relativistic bound-state

W =

p

and outgoing wave functions.

6

For electron scattering, we use the electromagnetic vertex function for a free nucleon

Γµ = FV (Q2)γµ + iσµν qν
2m

FM (Q2),

(12)

where σµν = i[γµ, γν]/2, FV and FM are the Dirac and Pauli nucleon form factors. We use

the approximation of Ref. [34] for the Dirac and Pauli nucleon form factors and employ the

de Forest prescription [35] and Coulomb gauge for the oﬀ-shell vector current vertex Γµ,

because the bound nucleons are oﬀ-shell.

In RDWIA calculations the independent particle shell model (IPSM) is assumed for

the nuclear structure.

In Eq.(11) the relativistic bound-state wave function for nucleons

Φ are obtained as the self-consistent solutions of a Dirac equation, derived within a rela-

tivistic mean-ﬁeld approach, from a Lagrangian containing σ, ω, and ρ mesons [36]. The

nucleon bound-state functions were calculated by the TIMORA code [37] with the normal-

ization factors S relative to full occupancy of the IPSM orbitals. For carbon an average

factor hSi ≈ 89% is used, and for 40Ca and 40Ar the occupancy is hSi ≈ 87% on average.

These estimations of the depletion of the hole state follows from the RDWIA analysis of

12C(e, e′p) [38, 39] and 40Ca(e, e′p) [16].

In this work we assume that the source of the

reduction of the (e, e′p) spectroscopic factors with respect to the mean ﬁeld values are the

NN short-range and tensor correlations in the ground state, leading to the appearance of

the high-momentum and high-energy component in the nucleon distribution in the target.

In the RDWIA, ﬁnal state interaction eﬀects for the outgoing nucleon are taken into

account. The distorted-wave function of the knocked out nucleon Ψ is evaluated as a solu-

tion of a Dirac equation containing a phenomenological relativistic optical potential. This

potential consists of a real part, which describes the rescattering of the ejected nucleon and

an imaginary part for the absorption of it into unobserved channels. The EDAD1 param-

eterization [40] of the relativistic optical potential for carbon and calcium was used in this

work. A complex optical potential with a nonzero imaginary part generally produces an

absorption of the ﬂux. However, for the inclusive cross section, the total ﬂux must be con-

served. The inclusive responses (i.e., no ﬂux lost) can be handled by simply removing the

imaginary terms in the potential. This yields results that are almost identical to those cal-

culate via relativistic Green’s function approach [41, 42] and Green’s function Monte Carlo

method [43] in which the FSI eﬀects are treated by means of complex potential and total

ﬂux is conserved.

7

The inclusive cross sections with the FSI eﬀects, taking into account the NN correlations

were calculated using the method proposed in Ref. [8] with the nucleon high-momentum

and high-energy distribution from Ref. [44] renormalized to value of 11% for carbon and of

13% for calcium and argon. The contribution of the NN-correlated pairs is evaluated in

the impulse approximation, i.e., the virtual photon couples to only one member of the NN

pair.

It is a one-body current process that leads to the emission of two nucleons (2p-2h

excitation).

The evaluation of the 2p-2h MEC contributions is performed within the relativistic Fermi

gas model [18, 45]. The short-range NN-correlations and FSI eﬀects were not considered
in this approach. The elementary hadronic tensor W µν

2p2h is given by the bilinear product
of the matrix elements of the two-body electromagnetic MEC. Only one-pion exchange is

included. The two-body current operator is obtained from the electroweak pion production

amplitudes for the nucleon [46] with the coupling a second nucleon to the emitted pion.

The two-body electromagnetic current is the sum of seagull, pion-in-ﬂight, and Delta-pole

currents. The seagull terms are associated with the interaction of the virtual proton at

the NNπ vertex, whereas the pion-in-ﬂight operator is referred to the direct interaction of

photon with the virtual pion. The ∆ peak is the main contribution to the pion production

cross section. However, inside the nucleus ∆ can also decay into one nucleon that rescatters

producing two-nucleon emission without pions. As a result, the MEC peak is located in the

dip region between the QE and Delta peaks, i.e., the invariant mass of the pion-nucleon pair

W 2 = (q + pA)2 = m2 + 2mω − Q2 varies in the range (mπ + m) ≤ W ≤ 1.3 − 1.4 GeV,

where mπ is the mass of pion.

The exact evaluation of the 2p-2h hadronic tensor in a fully relativistic way performed in

Refs. [18, 45] is highly non-trivial. In the present work we evaluate the electromagnetic MEC

response functions Ri,M EC of electron scattering on carbon using accurate parameterizations

of the exact MEC calculations. The 2p-2h MEC contributions for 40Ca and 40Ar were

calculated using the parameterization for 12C rescaled for calcium and argon according to

Ref. [47]. The parameterization form employed for the diﬀerent electroweak responses is the

function of (ω, |q|) and valid in the range of momentum transfer |q| = 200–2000 MeV. The

expressions for the ﬁtting parameters are described in detail in Refs. [20, 21, 48].

Finally, the inelastic response functions Ri,in were calculated using the parameterization

for the neutron [32] and proton [33] structure functions. This approach is based on an

8

empirical ﬁt to describe the measurements of inelastic electron-proton and electron-deuteron

cross sections in the kinematic range of four-momentum transfer 0 < Q2 < 8 GeV2 and ﬁnal

state invariant mass 1.1 < Wx < 3.1 GeV, thus starting from pion production region to the

highly-inelastic region. These ﬁts are constrained by the high precision longitudinal σL and

transverse σT separated cross section measurements and provide a good description of the

structures seen in inclusive (e, e′) cross sections.

III. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

Before providing reliable predictions for neutrino scattering, any model must be validated

by confronting it with electron scattering data. The agreement between the model’s pre-

dictions and data in the vector sector of electroweak interaction gives us conﬁdence in the

extension of this phenomenological approach and its validity at least in the vector sector of

the electroweak interaction.

To test the RDWIA+MEC+RES approach we calculated the double-diﬀerential inclusive

12C(e, e′), 40Ca(e, e′), and 40Ar(e, e′) cross sections as functions of the energy transfer to the

nucleus.

Results for carbon and calcium are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, and

compared with data from Refs. [49–56]. Each panel corresponds to the ﬁxed values of the

incident electron energy E and scattering angle θ. The kinematical coverage includes both

quasielastic peak, dip region, and extends to the region of the delta-production peak.

In Figs. 1 and 2 we show the separate contributions to the inclusive cross section from

QE (dot-dashed line), 2p-2h MEC (dashed line), and inelastic (dotted line) processes. The

total contribution is presented by a solid line. The panels have been ordered according

to the corresponding value for the momentum transfer at the quasielastic peak qQE. This

corresponds to the value of |q| where the maximum in the QE peak appears. The qQE runs

from ≈ 310 MeV to ≈ 590 MeV for carbon and 340 < qQE < 600 MeV for calcium.

The systematic analysis presented in Figs. 1 and 2 shows that the RDWIA+MEC+RES

approach leads to a good description of the whole set of (e, e′) data, validating the reliability

of our predictions. The positions, widths, and heights of the QE peak are reproduced by the

model within the experimental errors, taking into account not only the QE domain but also

the contributions given by the 2p-2h MEC and inelastic terms. Notice that the dip region is

also successfully reproduced by the theory. Only at the lower value of qQE < 340 MeV the

11

theoretical predictions for carbon overestimate data by 30-50% at the QE peak, and this

should be expected since this is the region where the impulse approximation conditions may

not be satisﬁed and collective nuclear eﬀects are important.

The agreement between theory and data in the inelastic region also is good within the ex-

perimental uncertainties. The inelastic part of the cross section is dominanted by the ∆ peak

that contributes to the transverse response function. In particular, ωQE =

|q|2 + m2 − m

corresponds roughly to the center of the quasielastic peak, and ω∆ =

∆ − m to
the ∆-resonance [m∆ is the mass of ∆(1232)]. When the momentum transfer is not too high

allowing for a test of theoretical models for each speciﬁc process. On the other hand, for in-

creasing values of the momentum transfer the peaks corresponding to the ∆ and QE domains

become closer, and their overlap increases signiﬁcantly. In this case only the comparison

with a complete model including inelastic processes is meaningful.

In addition to the previous analysis, we have also tested the validity of the RD-

WIA+MEC+RES approach through the analysis of the recent JLab data [57, 58] for in-

clusive electron scattering data on carbon and argon at incident electron energy E = 2.222

GeV and scattering angle θ = 15.54◦. As observed in Fig. 3, the agreement between theory

and data is very good over most of the energy spectrum, with some minor discrepancy seen

only at the ∆-resonance peak. For completeness, we also present in this ﬁgure the electron-

argon scattering spectrum measured at the beam energy E = 700 MeV and scattering angle

θ = 32◦ [59]. Note that the 2p-2h MEC response, peaked in the dip region between the QE

and ∆ peaks is essential to reproduce the data.

In the SLAC experiment [50] the inclusive cross sections dσ/dεdΩ for electron scat-

tering on 12C and 40Ca were measured in the same kinematical conditions,

i.e., at in-

cident electron energy E = 500 MeV and θ = 32◦. Using the SLAC and JLab data

we estimated the measured (Ca/C) = (dσCa/dεdΩ)nucl/(dσC/dεdΩ)nucl and (Ar/C) =
(dσAr/dεdΩ)nucl/(dσC/dεdΩ)nucl ratios, where the diﬀerential cross sections (dσi/dεdΩ)nucl

are scaled with the number of nucleons in the targets. Figure 4 shows the measured ratios

as functions of energy transfer as compared to the RDWIA+MEC+RES calculations in the

QE peak region. The calculated (Ca/C)

[16] and (Ar/C) ratios agree with data where

argon from Refs. [57, 58] vs energy transfer ω, compared with the RDWIA+MEC+RES prediction.

The beam energy is E = 2.222 GeV and scattering angle θ = 15.541◦. For completeness, data for

electron scattering oﬀ argon at E = 700 MeV and θ = 32◦ from Ref. [56] are also shown (c). As

shown in the key, the separate QE, 2p-2h MEC, and inelastic contributions are presented.

13

the observed eﬀects of ≈ 15% in the QE peak region is higher than experimental errors. In

Ref. [16] it was shown that the ground-state properties of these nuclei and FSI eﬀects give

the dominant contributions to the diﬀerence between the 12C and 40Ca(40Ar) diﬀerential

cross section per nucleon. The diﬀerence between the results for the carbon and argon tar-

gets is relevant in the context of Monte Carlo simulation for the DUNE neutrino oscillation

experiment, where liquid argon and scintillator detectors are planned to be used as near

detectors.

The agreement between theory and data in the dip region also gives us a conﬁdence in

the reliability of our calculations of the MEC eﬀects. In this region the contributions emerge

from the QE, 2p-2h MEC, and inelastic domains and can signiﬁcantly overlap with each other

making it diﬃcult to experimentally separate the diﬀerent reaction channels, for instance, the

QE and two-nucleon knockout responses. Therefore, the comparison with data in this region

can be considered to be a critical test for the validity of the RDWIA+MEC+RES approach,

and particularly, the description of the 2p-2h MEC contribution that reaches its maximum

value here. We can consider the diﬀerence between the calculated and measured cross

sections observed at the maximum of the 2p-2h MEC contribution as a conservative estimate

of the accuracy of the MEC response calculation in the vector sector of the electroweak

interaction.

The electron scattering cross sections on carbon and calcium with scattering angle θ <

60◦, corresponding to the kinematic of the neutrino oscillation experiments were analyzed.

The 12C(e, e′) data were divided into two sets with electron energies 0.4 ≤ E ≤ 1.2 GeV and

1.5 ≤ E ≤ 3.5 GeV, that approximately corresponds to neutrino energies of the T2K (low

energy) and NOvA (high energy) experiments.

We calculated Ri

dip = (dσi/dεdΩ)cal/(dσi/dεdΩ)data ratios at the momentum transfer
|q|dip that corresponds to the minimum of the measured cross section, where (dσi/dεdΩ)cal
and (dσi/dεdΩ)data are calculated and measured cross sections, correspondingly, for elec-

tron scattering oﬀ carbon (i=C) and calcium (i=Ca). The values of |q|dip running from

≈ 250 MeV to ≈ 1100 MeV for carbon and 340 ≤ |q|dip ≤ 660 MeV for calcium. We

also calculated the 2p-2h MEC contributions to the (e, e′) diﬀerential cross sections, i.e.,

δM EC = (dσ/dεdΩ)M EC/(dσ/dεdΩ) ratios, where the (dσ/dεdΩ)M EC) is the 2p-2h MEC
diﬀerential cross sections for electron scattering oﬀ nuclei. Figure 5 shows the ratios Ri

dip
and δM EC as functions of |q|dip. The result presented in Fig. 5(a) demonstrates that the

40Ca and 12C (a) are from Ref. [50] for electron beam energy E = 500 MeV and scattering angle

θ = 60◦. Data for 40Ar and 12C (b) are from Ref. [57, 58] for E = 2222 MeV and θ = 15.54◦. The

dip ratio increases with |q|dip from 0.7 at |q|dip ≈ 250 MeV to ≈ 1 at |q|dip ≈ 500 MeV
and does not depend on electron energy. At |q|dip > 500 MeV the calculated and measured

cross sections are in good agreement within the experimental errors. On the other hand

the contribution δM EC [Fig. 5(c)] reduces with momentum transfer from 0.65 at |q|dip ≈ 250

MeV to 0.42 at |q|dip ≈ 500, and up to 0.2 at |q|dip ≈ 1000 MeV and also does not depend on

dip
increases with |q|dip from 0.7 at |q|dip = 350 MeV to ≈ 1 at |q|dip > 500 MeV. The 2p-2h

MEC contribution [Fig. 5(d)] decreases with momentum transfer from 0.68 at |q|dip = 300

MeV, and up to 0.38 at |q|dip = 600 MeV.

(ﬁlled circles).

The Ri

dip ratios for carbon (upper panel) and calcium (lower panel) are shown in Fig. 6

as functions of δM EC. The ﬁgure shows that the Ri

dip ≈ 1 up to δM EC ≈ 0.45 and then

is reduced with δM EC to ≈ 0.8 at δM EC ≈ 0.6. Thus, the contribution of the 2p-2h MEC

decreases with momentum transfer and the accuracy of the inclusive cross section calculated

within the RDWIA+MEC+RES approach in the dip region improves with |q|dip from 35%

at |q|dip ≈ 250 MeV (|q|dip ≈ kF ) to 10% at |q|dip ≥ 500 MeV (|q|dip ≥ 2kF ), where kF is

17

the Fermi momentum. We can use this estimation as conservative estimate of the accuracy

of the 2p-2h MEC response calculation in the vector sector of the electroweak interaction.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we studied the quasielastic, 2p-2h MEC, and inelastic electron scattering

on carbon, calcium, and argon targets in the RDWIA+MEC+RES approach. This approach

was extended to the whole energy spectrum, incorporating the contributions coming from

the QE, inelastic and 2p-2h meson exchange currents. In calculation of the QE cross sections

within the RDWIA, the eﬀects of FSI and short-range NN-correlations in the target ground

state were taking into account. An accurate parameterization of the exact MEC calculations

of the nuclear response functions was used to evaluate the MEC response. The inelastic

response functions were calculated using the parameterization for the neutron and proton

structure functions. These functions were obtained from the ﬁt of the measured inelastic

electron-proton and electron-deuteron cross sections.

The present approach is capable of reproducing successfully the whole energy spectrum

of (e, e′) data at very diﬀerent kinematics, including the recent JLab data for inclusive

electron scattering on carbon and argon. It was shown that the measured and calculated in

the RDWIA model the QE cross sections per nucleon target of electron scattering on 40Ca

(40Ar) are lower than those for 12C. The eﬀect of 15% is observed in the QE region and is

higher than experimental errors.

For electron scattering on the carbon and calcium targets we evaluated the ratios of the

calculated inclusive cross sections to the measured ones at the momentum transfer |q|dip

that corresponds to the minimum of the measured cross sections in the dip region. We

also estimated the 2p-2h MEC contribution to the (e, e′) cross section at |q|dip. At the

|q|dip < 250 MeV the RDWIA+MEC+RES approach underestimates the measured cross

sections by about 30% and is in agreement with data within the experimental uncertainties

at |q|dip ≥ 500 MeV. The MEC contribution decreases with |q|dip from 65% at |q|dip = 250 to

20% at |q|dip = 1000. These results depend weakly on electron beam energy. So, we validated

the RDWIA+MEC+RES approach in the vector sector of the electroweak interaction by

describing 12C, 40Ca, and 40Ar data.
