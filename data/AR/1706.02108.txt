ABSTRACT
We present deep 3500−10000 ˚A spectra of H II regions and planetary nebulae (PNe) in the star-
burst irregular galaxy NGC 4449, acquired with the Multi Object Double Spectrograph at the Large
Binocular Telescope. Using the “direct” method, we derived the abundance of He, N, O, Ne, Ar,
and S in six H II regions and in four PNe in NGC 4449. This is the ﬁrst case of PNe studied in a
starburst irregular outside the Local Group. Our H II region and PN sample extends over a galacto-
centric distance range of ≈2 kpc and spans ≈0.2 dex in oxygen abundance, with average values of
12 + log(O/H) = 8.37 ± 0.05 and 8.3 ± 0.1 for H II regions and PNe, respectively. PNe and H II
regions exhibit similar oxygen abundances in the galacto-centric distance range of overlap, while PNe
appear more than ∼1 dex enhanced in nitrogen with respect to H II regions. The latter result is
the natural consequence of N being mostly synthesized in intermediate-mass stars and brought to the
stellar surface during dredge-up episodes. On the other hand, the similarity in O abundance between
H II regions and PNe suggests that NGC 4449’ s interstellar medium has been poorly enriched in
α-elements since the progenitors of the PNe were formed. Finally, our data reveal the presence of a
negative oxygen gradient for both H II regions and PNe, whilst nitrogen does not exhibit any signif-
icant radial trend. We ascribe the (unexpected) nitrogen behaviour as due to local N enrichment by
the conspicuous Wolf-Rayet population in NGC 4449.

1. INTRODUCTION
Stellar and galaxy evolution are closely coupled: on
the one hand, subsequent generations of high- and
intermediate-mass stars continuously modify the energy
balance and chemical composition of the interstellar
medium (ISM) of their host galaxy; on the other hand
gas accretion by diﬀuse or ﬁlamentary cold streams
(Dekel et al. 2009) or by gas-rich dwarfs may trigger new
star formation and dilute the metallicity of the ISM. It is
thus mandatory to combine accurate star formation his-
tories (SFHs) from resolved stellar studies and chemical
abundance studies in individual systems as key ingredi-
ents to reconstruct a coherent and complete picture of
how galaxies formed and evolved.

Since the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST),
much eﬀort has been done to resolve the individual
stars and to derive the SFHs in large galaxy sam-
ples within the Local Universe (e.g., Dalcanton et al.
2009; McQuinn et al. 2010; Monelli et al. 2010a,b;
Weisz et al. 2011; Dalcanton et al. 2012; Weisz et al.
2014; Calzetti et al. 2015, see also Tolstoy, Hill & Tosi
(2009) for a review). At the same time, the availability of
multi-object spectroscopy on 8-10 m telescopes has pro-
moted chemical composition studies of H II regions and
planetary nebulae (PNe) over large galaxy areas (e.g.,

Bresolin et al. 2005; Magrini et al. 2005; Pe˜na et al.
2007; Bresolin et al. 2009b; Magrini & Gon¸calves 2009;
Stasi´nska et al. 2013; Annibali et al. 2015; Berg et al.
2015). In particular, the simultaneous study of chemi-
cal abundances in PNe and in H II regions can provide
more stringent constraints on chemical evolution models,
since H II regions probe the present-day composition of
the ISM, while PNe, being the end-product of the evo-
lution of stars with masses 0.8M⊙< M < 8 M⊙, oﬀer a
view of the ISM composition back to several Gyrs ago.

PNe enrich the ISM mainly in He, C and N, while
leaving untouched elements such as Ne, S and Ar whose
abundance remains the initial one of the PN progeni-
tor. O is also usually thought to be unaﬀected by the
progenitor reaction processes, although it has sometimes
been suggested to be enhanced (Marigo 2001) in metal-
poor PNe. The important production of He, C and N by
PNe is due to dredge-up episodes occurring during the
red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) phases of intermediate- and low-mass stars, and
to hot-bottom burning (HBB, e.g. Renzini & Voli 1981)
in the most massive AGB stars ( ∼> 4M⊙, depending on
metallicity), that change the stellar surface abundances
of these elements.

Here we exploited the high performance of the Multi
Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) mounted on the
Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) to perform the ﬁrst
combined study of H II regions and PNe in the irregu-
lar galaxy NGC 4449 (α2000 = 12h 28m 11s.9, δ2000 =
+44◦ 05′ 40′′), at a distance of 3.82±0.27 Mpc from us
(Annibali et al. 2008). NGC 4449 is of particular inter-
est because it is one of the strongest starburst in the lo-
cal Universe (star formation rate∼1 M⊙ yr−1, or ∼0.04

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

M⊙ yr−1 kpc−2, McQuinn et al. 2010; Annibali et al.
2011), and moreover it exhibits several characteristics
suggesting that it has accreted one or possibly several
smaller companions: more speciﬁcally, i) it has a very ex-
tended H I halo (≈90 kpc in diameter), which is a factor
of ∼10 larger than the optical diameter of the galaxy and
rotates in the opposite direction to the gas in the center
(Hunter et al. 1998); ii) it is one of the very few dwarf
galaxies where a stellar tidal stream has been discovered
so far (Mart´ınez-Delgado et al. 2012; Rich et al. 2012);
iii) it hosts an old, 106 M⊙cluster associated with two
tails of young stars, potentially the nucleus of an accreted
gas-rich satellite galaxy (Annibali et al. 2012). Because
of these properties, NGC 4449 is a perfect laboratory to
test the hypothesis that strong starbursts in dwarf galax-
ies are caused by accretion or merging events, as sug-
gested by recent studies showing that disturbed H I kine-
matics, H I companions, and ﬁlamentary H I structures
are more common in starburst dwarfs than in typical
star-forming irregulars (Lelli et al. 2014). NGC 4449 was
targeted with the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS)
on board of HST a few years ago to resolve its stel-
lar content and to derive its SFH (Annibali et al. 2008;
McQuinn et al. 2010; Sacchi et al. 2017). These analyses
indicate that NGC 4449 enhanced its SF activity ≈500
Myr ago, while the rate was much lower at earlier epochs;
however, the impossibility to reach, even with HST, the
main sequence turnoﬀs at a distance of ∼4 Mpc implies
that the SFH of NGC 4449 is very uncertain prior to 1−2
Gyr ago (see e.g. Sacchi et al. 2017).

In this paper we present a study of the H II region
and PN chemical abundances in NGC 4449 with the pur-
pose of providing a key complement to previous stellar
population studies. Chemical evolution models based on
the SFH and on the derived abundances (see e.g. the
approach of Romano et al. 2006) will be presented in a
forthcoming paper and will provide new insights into the
past evolution of NGC 4449. The paper is structured as
follows: Section 2 describes the observations and data
reduction, Section 3 informs on the procedure for the
derivation of the reddening-corrected emission line ﬂuxes,
while temperatures, densities, and chemical abundances
of H II regions and PNe are derived in Section 4. Sec-
tion 5 focuses on the study of the Wolf-Rayet spectral fea-
tures. In Section 6 and 7 we analyse and discuss the de-
rived abundances, element ratios and spatial abundance
distributions, while in Section 8 we compare the proper-
ties of our PNe with those of Local Group star forming
dwarfs. Our conclusions are summarised in Section 9.
2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

PN candidates and H II regions were identiﬁed on
HST/ACS images in the F435W (∼ B), F555W (∼ V),
F814W (∼ I), and F658N (Hα) ﬁlters (GO program
10585; PI: Aloisi). These data cover a ﬁeld of view as
large as ∼ 400′′ × 200” (two ACS pointings) and al-
low to identify both H II regions and PNe up to large
galacto-centric distances. In the ACS images, H II re-
gions are resolved and appear as regions of diﬀuse Hα
and V (i.e.
[OIII]λλ4959,5007) emission. On the other
hand, PN candidates were visually selected from a B,
V, I color-combined image looking for point-like sources
that stand out in V compared to B and I because of the
[OIII]λλ4959,5007 emission lines. The 29 selected candi-

dates were then cross-identiﬁed on the shallower Hα im-
age to eliminate background emission-line sources. This
provided 13 PN candidates in NGC 4449, whose spa-
tial location is shown in Figure 1. We repeated the PN
search using archival ACS images in the narrow-band
F502N ﬁlter (GO program 10522, PI Calzetti) instead of
the F555W image and then cross-checked in Hα. The
F502N ﬁlter, centered around the [O III]λ5007 line, al-
lows for a better contrast of the PNe compared to stars;
however, the smaller ∼ 200′′ × 200” ﬁeld of view of the
available data (corresponding to just one ACS pointing)
does not permit an inspection of the NGC 4449 out-
skirts where PNe can be more easily studied thanks to
the lower galaxy background. All the PNe that were
identiﬁed from the F555W image were also found when
using the F502N image (however three PNe fall outside
the ﬁeld of view of the F502N image); 15 additional PNe
were identiﬁed when adopting the F502N image in place
of the F555W one (see Figure 1), for a total sample of
28 PNe.

PNe and H II regions were targeted for spectroscopy
with LBT/MODS from January 21, 2013 until April 5,
2013 within program 2012B 23, RUN A (PI Annibali).
The 1”×10” slit mask is shown in Figure 1. We were
able to accomodate into the MODS slit mask 5 PNe out
of 28, chosen in the most external regions of NGC 4449
to minimize the contamination from the diﬀuse ionized
gas. Six remaining slits were positioned on H II regions.
Figure 2 shows color-composite HST images for the PNe
and H II regions targeted with LBT, with superimposed
the MODS slits. We observed our targets using the blue
G400L (3200−5800 ˚A) and the red G670L (5000−10000
˚A) gratings on the blue and red channels in dichroic mode
for a total exposure time of ∼10.5 h, organized into 14
sub-exposures of ∼2700 s each. The seeing varied be-
tween ∼0.6” and ∼1.3”, and the airmass from ∼1.0 to
∼1.3. Typically, the exposures were acquired at hour
angles between ∼ −1 h and ∼ +1 h to avoid signiﬁcant
eﬀects from diﬀerential atmospheric refraction (see e.g.
Filippenko 1982). Only 8 sub-exposures with a seeing
. 1′′ were retained for our study, for a total integration
time of ∼ 6 h. The journal of the observations is provided
in Table 1.

formed with the Italian LBT Spectroscopic reduction Fa-

two-dimensional (2D) spectra for the individual sub-
exposures. Then, the individual sub-exposures were sky-
subtracted and combined into ﬁnal 2D blue and red
frames. The sky subtraction was performed with the
background task in IRAF5, typically choosing the win-
dows at the two opposite sides of the central source. This
procedure removed, together with the sky, also the con-
tribution from the NGC 4449 unresolved background. As
an example, we show in Figure 3 the two-dimensional
sky-subtracted combined spectra for our PNe in selected
spectral regions. The ﬁgure shows that we were able
to detect the [O III]λ4363 line in all PNe thanks both
to the good MODS resolution and to the NGC 4449’
s systemic velocity of ≈210 km s−1, allowing for suﬃ-
cient separation with the Hg I λ4358 sky line. For region

ground derived for PN 5 (slit 11) as a sky template, and
subtracted it to region H II-3. This is a reasonable choice
because PN 5 is located at fairly large galactocentric dis-
tance and is aﬀected by negligible contribution from the
NGC 4449 unresolved background. The one-dimensional
(1D) spectra were extracted from the 2D calibrated and
sky-subtracted spectra by running the apall task in the
twodspec IRAF package. To derive the eﬀective spec-
tral resolution, we used the combined 1D spectra with

corrections were applied using the average extinction
curve available from the MODS calibration webpage at
http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/MODS/Calib/.
This may introduce some uncertainty in ﬂux calibration,
in particular at the bluest wavelengths, where the eﬀect
of atmospheric extinction is more severe. By comparing
the sensitivity curves from Feige 56 with those obtained
from another standard, Feige 66, observed on January
20, 2013 at an airmass of ∼1 and with the same setup
of Feige 56 as part of our 2012B 23, RUN B program6,
we found a ∼ 15% diﬀerence at wavelegnths below ∼
4000 ˚A, while the curves agree within ∼ 1% at redder
wavelengths.

Eventually, to evaluate the accuracy of the ﬂux cali-
bration for our spectra, we used HST/ACS imaging in

a smaller ﬁeld of view. The six H II regions, plus PN-
3 and PN-4, fall within the ﬁeld of view of all six im-
ages; however, we considered only H II regions to the
purpose of checking the ﬂux calibration, because of their
signal-to-noise higher than in PNe. Aperture photome-
try was performed on the images within the same extrac-

tion aperture of the 1D spetcra using the Polyphot task
in IRAF. The F555W magnitudes in the ACS Vegamag
system derived for the H II regions and the 5 PNe tar-
geted with MODS are given in Tables 2 and 3 in the Ap-
pendix (see instead Table 9 in Section 8 for a complete
list of the F555W and the F502N magnitudes derived
for the total sample of 28 PNe). For the H II regions,
we also computed synthetic magnitudes in the F435W,
F502N, F550M, F555W, F814W and F658N ACS ﬁlters

dots correspond to the following ACS bandpasses: F435W, F502N, F555W, F550M, F658N and F814W. For each H II region, the solid

by convolving the MODS spectra with the ACS band-
passes: this was done by running the Calcphot task in the
Synphot package. Figure 4 shows, for each H II region,
the comparison between the observed ACS ﬂuxes and
the synthetic ones (in logarithmic scale) as a function of
wavelength. We notice that the Fλ,ACS ﬂuxes are smaller
than the Fλ,SY N ones, indicating that the ﬂuxes from the
spectra are overestimated. This eﬀect is expected, and its
origin is well discussed by Smith et al. (2007): ﬂux cali-
brations are usually tied to reference point source obser-
vations, and therefore include an implicit correction for
the fraction of the point source light that falls outside the
slit; however, in the limit of a perfect uniform, slit-ﬁlling
extended source, the diﬀractive losses out of the slit are
perfectly balanced by the diﬀractive gains into the slit
from emission beyond its geometric boundary. There-
fore, the point-source-based calibration will inevitably
cause an overestimate of the extended source ﬂux. The
log(Fλ,ACS) − log(Fλ,SY N ) zero point oﬀsets of Fig. 4
were used to anchor our H II region spectra to the ACS
magnitudes; this procedure is useful to establish an abso-
lute ﬂux calibration for these objects. On the other hand,
no correction was applied to the PN spectra, for two main
reasons: 1) these sources are point-like at NGC 4449’ s
distance (also in the HST images), and therefore we do
not expect the spectral ﬂuxes to be overestimated as in
the case of extended H II regions; 2) synthetic ﬂuxes
derived by convolving the ACS ﬁlter throughputs with
the PN spectra are highly aﬀected by uncertainties in
the background subtraction, and do not permit a reliable
comparison with the ACS photometry. The standard de-
viation around the average log Fλ,ACS − logFλ,SY N value

derived for the H II regions is quite modest, correspond-
ing to an average ﬂux uncertainty in the range ≈2% -
≈11%. The low dispersion about the mean and the lack
of a general trend with wavelength apparently conﬁrms
that our observational setup prevented signiﬁcant ﬂux
losses at the bluest wavelengths due to atmospheric dif-
ferential refraction (Filippenko 1982).

As an example, we show the ﬁnal calibrated spectra for
H II region H II-1 and planetary nebula PN-1 in Figures 5
and 6, respectively. The spectra of all the other H II
regions and PNe are provided in Figures 16 to 24 in the
Appendix.

3. EMISSION LINE MEASUREMENT

Emission line ﬂuxes for H II regions and PNe were
obtained with the deblend function available in the
splot IRAF task. We used this function to ﬁt single
lines, groups of lines close in wavelength, or blended
lines. Lines were ﬁtted with Gaussian proﬁles, treat-
ing the centroids and the widths as free parame-
ters; however, when ﬁtting groups of
lines close in
λ (e.g., He I λ6678 + [S II]λ6716 + [S II]λ6731) or (par-
tially) blended (Hα + [N II]λλ6548, 84), we forced the
lines to have all the same width. On the other hand,
no constraint on the line centroids (e.g. ﬁxed separation
between the lines) was assumed and we let the deblend
function to ﬁnd the best-ﬁt line centers independently.
This was a reasonable choice given that even faint “key”
lines, such as [O III]λ4363 and [N II]λλ6548, 84, are de-
tected with a good signal-to-noise in our spectra; how-
ever, had we had worse data, it would have been more
appropriate to set the wavelengths of the blended lines

Figure 5. LBT/MODS spectra in the blue and red channels for H II-1 in NGC 4449 with indicated all the identiﬁed emission lines. A
linear interpolation was performed in the 5400 - 5800 ˚A region where the sensitivities of the blue and red detectors drop. The spectra of
the other H II regions (H II-2, H II-3, H II-4, H II-5, H II-6) are provided in the Appendix.

and to allow for a common Doppler shift, in order to
reduce the noise on the weak lines measurement. The
continuum was deﬁned choosing two continuum windows
to the left and to the right of the line or line complex,
and ﬁtting with a linear regression. Balmer lines, po-
tentially aﬀected by underlying stellar absorption, were
ﬁtted with a combination of Voigt proﬁles in absorption
plus Gaussian proﬁles in emission (see Section 3.1 for
more details).

The ﬁnal emission ﬂuxes were obtained repeating the
measurement several times with slightly diﬀerent contin-
uum choices, and averaging the results. To compute the
errors, we derived the standard deviation of the diﬀerent
measurements (σF,line). The results for the H II regions
and the PNe are provided in Tables 2 and 3 of the Ap-
pendix, respectively. From the tables, we notice that the
errors on the derived ﬂuxes are very small: for instance,
in the case of H II regions, σF,line is below 1% for the
brightest lines such as [O III]λ5007. To get more realis-
tic errors, we added in quadrature to σF,line a 15% ﬂux

error below ∼ 4000 ˚A to account for atmospheric extinc-
tion uncertainties (see Section 2), and a 2% to 11% ﬂux
error, corresponding to the scatter around the average
oﬀsets in Figure 4, at redder wavelengths. For PNe, the
standard deviation from the diﬀerent line measurements
turned out signiﬁcantly larger than for H II regions, typi-
cally in the range ≈2% to ≈20%; an arbitrary additional
15% error, equalling the ﬂux calibration uncertainty be-
low ∼ 4000 ˚A and slightly above the largest scatter for
the H II regions in Fig. 4, was added in quadrature to
σF,line over the entire wavelength range.

3.1. Absorption from underlying stellar population

To account for underlying stellar absorption in H II
regions, spectral regions around Balmer lines were ﬁt-
ted with a combination of Voigt proﬁles (in absorption)

linear interpolation was performed in the 5400 - 5800 ˚A region where the sensitivities of the blue and red detectors drop. A ∼1 ˚A boxcar
ﬁlter smoothing was applied to the spectrum to better highlight the low singal-to-noise features. The spectra of the other PNe (PN-2,
PN-3, PN-4, PN-5) are provided in the Appendix.

plus Gaussian proﬁles (in emission), as shown in Fig-
ure 7. Absorption wings are more prominent for bluer
lines, because Balmer emission decreases very rapidly to-
ward bluer wavelength, while the absorption equivalent
widths remain roughly constant with wavelength. This
implies that the contribution from absorption and emis-
sion can be better separated for bluer lines, while ﬁts
to red Balmer lines (Hβ and Hα) tend to be highly af-
fected by a degeneracy between absorption strength and
FWHM of the line. To overcome this problem, we ﬁtted
the H10(λ3798) and H9(λ3835) lines in the ﬁrst place,
and then adopted the derived (Lorentian and Gaussian)
FWHM values for the ﬁts to all the other Balmer lines up
to Hβ. We derived average absorption equivalent widths
and standard deviations of 3.3±0.6 ˚A, 4.2±0.7 ˚A, 4.2±0.3
˚A, 4.2 ± 0.6 ˚A, 4.9 ± 0.1 ˚A, 5.6 ± 0.3 ˚A, and 5.6 ± 1.2 ˚A for
H10, H9, H8, Hǫ, Hδ, Hγ, and Hβ, respectively, compat-
ible with a simple stellar population (SSP) of age ≃10-20
Myr and Z = 0.008 (about NGC 4449’ s metallicity) from

the Starburst99 models (Leitherer et al. 2014, hereafter
SB99). For such an SSP, the models predict a typical
absorption equivalent width of ≃ 3.5 ˚A for Hα, to be
compared with emission strengths in the range 100−2000
˚A. Therefore, we neglected the eﬀect of underlying ab-
sorption on the Hα + [N II]λλ6548, 84 emission complex.
In conclusion, our procedure accounts for the presence
of underlying Balmer absorptions by simultaneously ﬁt-
ting the emission and absorption components, so that no
further correction needs to be applied to the Hydrogen
emission lines.

As for Helium, absorption wings are too shallow to
allow for a decomposition of absorption and emission
through spectral ﬁts. Thus we used the predictions of
simple stellar population models to correct for this ef-
fect. The SB 99 models provide for a ≃10-20 Myr old
population with Z = 0.008 typical absorption equiv-
alent widths of ≃0.5 ˚A, ≃0.3 ˚A and ≃0.3 ˚A in the
He I λ4471, He I λ5876 and He I λ6678 lines, respec-

Figure 7. Example (region H II-6) of spectral ﬁt to the regions around some Balmer lines. The asterisks are the observed spectrum,
while the continuous line is the best ﬁt. The individual components of the ﬁt are plotted with a dashed line: linear continuum, Gaussian
proﬁles for the emission lines, and Voigt proﬁles for the Balmer absorption lines. The outcome of ﬁt to the H10(λ3798) and H9(λ3835)
lines, with prominent absorption wings, was used to ﬁx the Lorentian and Gaussian FWHMs during the ﬁt to redder Balmer lines. The
derived Balmer equivalent widths in absorption and in emission are provided within each panel. The absorption feature between H10 and
H9 is due to a blend of Fe I lines. The ﬁgure clearly shows that the contribution of absorption with respect to emission becomes increasingly
lower toward redder wavelengths (see section 3.1 for more details.)

tively. These contributions are not negligible when com-
pared with observed emissions in the range ≃ 1 − 9 ˚A,
≃ 9 − 55 ˚A, and ≃ 3 − 23 ˚A in our sample. Therefore,
we adopted the absorption EWs provided by SB 99 and
corrected the He I emission lines according to the for-
mula F ′(He I) = F (He I)+EWabs(SB 99)∗F (CON T ),
where F (He I) and F ′(He I) are the ”raw” and the cor-
rected ﬂuxes, respectively, EWabs(SB 99) is the stellar
absorption equivalent width from the SB 99 models, and
F (CON T ) is the ﬂux in the continuum measured from
the spectra.

3.2. Reddening correction
For H II regions, the reddening was derived from
the Hδ/Hα, Hγ/Hα and Hβ/Hα ratios assuming the
Cardelli et al. (1989) extinction law with RV = 3.05, ac-
cording to the formula:

E(B−V ) =

log10[(F Hλ1/F Hλ2)o/(F Hλ1/F Hλ2)t]
0.4 × RV × [Aλ2/AV − Aλ1/AV ]

(1)

where λ1 and λ2 are the wavelengths of the two Balmer
lines, (F Hλ1/F Hλ2)o and (F Hλ1/F Hλ2)t are, respec-
tively, the observed and theoretical Balmer emission line
ratios, and the magnitude attenuation ratio Aλ/AV is
that from Cardelli’ s law. We adopted theoretical Balmer
ratios of (F Hδ/F Hα)t = 0.090, (F Hγ/F Hα)t = 0.163,
and (F Hβ/F Hα)t = 0.350 from Storey & Hummer
(1995) for case B recombination assuming Te = 10, 000
K and ne = 100 cm−3, and AHδ/AV ∼ 1.45, AHγ /AV ∼
1.36, AHβ /AV ∼ 1.17 and AHα/AV ∼ 0.81 from
Cardelli’ s extinction curve. For each Balmer line ra-
tio, the error in E(B − V ) was obtained by propagating
the emission ﬂux errors into Eq. (1). It can be easily ver-
iﬁed from Eq. (1) and from the Aλ/AV values reported
above that, for equal emission ﬂux errors, the reddening

uncertainty is higher when using Balmer line ratios with
closer wavelength spacing, minimizing the Aλ2 − Aλ1 dif-
ference: for instance, a ∼5% ﬂux error provides an error
σE(B−V ) in the range ∼0.04−0.07 mag if the reddening
is estimated from the Hδ/Hα, Hγ/Hα and Hβ/Hα ratios
(as in our case), while using e.g. Hδ/Hγ implies σE(B−V )
as high as ∼0.28 mag.

For H II regions, the reddening was obtained by aver-
aging the results from the Hδ/Hα, Hγ/Hα and Hβ/Hα
ratios, and its uncertainty was computed as the standard
deviation; typically, the E(B − V ) values derived from
the three diﬀerent Balmer ratios turned out to be con-
sistent with each other, within the errors. Diﬀerences
in the E(B − V ) values obtained from diﬀerent Balmer
lines may arise from the fact that redder lines, aﬀected
by a lower extinction, probe larger optical depths of the
nebula (Calzetti et al. 1996). For PNe, we used instead
only the Hβ/Hα ratio, due to the faintness of the other
Balmer lines. For H II regions, the derived E(B − V )
values are in the range ∼ 0.10 ± 0.01 − 0.24 ± 0.03 mag,
while for PNe they are in the range ≈0−0.4 mag with a
typical uncertainty of ∼0.2 mag.

The emission line ﬂuxes are corrected for reddening

according to the formula :

Fc = Fo × 100.4×Aλ,
where Fo and Fc are the observed and the extinction-
corrected ﬂuxes, respectively, and Aλ = (Aλ/AV ) ×
RV × E(B − V ). The derived E(B−V ) values and the
reddening-corrected emission-line ﬂuxes for H II regions
and PNe are given in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

1.0.1 version of the PyNeb code (Luridiana et al. 2015),
which is based upon the FIVEL program developed
by De Robertis et al. (1987) and Shaw & Dufour (1994).
The getCrossTemDen task simultaneously derives elec-
tron densities (ne) and temperatures (Te) through an
iterative process assuming a density-sensitive and a
temperature-sensitive diagnostic line ratio: the quantity
(density or temperature) derived from one emission line
ratio is inserted into the other, and the process is iterated
until the two temperature-sensitive and density-sensitive
diagnostics give self-consistent results.

Notice that the adopted emissivities for He+ are those of
Porter et al. (2012, 2013), which include collisional exci-

100 cm−3, and Te in the range 9000 − 11000 K. Density
and temperature values for the individual H II regions are
given in Table 7. The associated errors were derived by
inputting into the getCrossTemDen task the ±1σ interval
for each diagnostic line ﬂux ratio.

The availability of multiple Te measurements in H II
regions allowed us to investigate the comparison between
temperatures measured for diﬀerent ions (O+, O+2,
S+2). The behaviour of Te[S III] against Te[O III], and of
Te[O II] against Te[O III] for our H II regions is shown in
Figure 8, together with the predicted correlations from
Garnett (1992) and Izotov et al. (2006) based on pho-
toionization models. The derived temperatures are con-
sistent, within the errors, with the predictions from the
models, although they do not exhibit clear correlations,
probably because of the small temperature range sam-

pled by our data. In particular, we notice that the data
points in the Te[O II] versus Te[O III] diagram exhibit
a large scatter around the theoretical relations, an eﬀect
that was also found and discussed by other authors (e.g.
Kennicutt et al. 2003; Bresolin et al. 2009a; Berg et al.
2015). A detailed discussion of the possible theoretical
and observational causes of this disagreement (e.g. re-
combination contribution to the [O II]λλ7320, 30 lines,
radiative transfer and shocks aﬀecting the [O II] lines,
reddening uncertainties) can be found in these studies.
We notice that our [O II] temperatures are aﬀected by
large observational errors, both because of the uncertain
ﬂux calibration below ∼4000 ˚A, as discussed in Section 2,
and because of the large uncertainty in the extinction-
corrected [O II] ratios, due to the large wavelength dif-
ference between the [O II]λλ3726, 29 doublet and the
[O II]λλ7320, 30 complex.7

To determine the abundances of the various ions, we
used the extinction-corrected ﬂuxes (listed in Table 4)
for the following lines: He I λ4471, He I λ5876, and
He I λ6678 for He+, He II λ4686 (when available)
for He+2, [N II]λ6548,6584 for N +, [O III]λ4959,5007
for O+2, [O II]λλ3726,29 and [O II]λλ7320,30 for O+,
[O I]λ6300 and [O I]λ6364 for O0, [Ne III]λ3869 for N e+2,
[S II]λλ6716,31 for S+, [S III]λ6312 and [S III]λ9069 +
λ9531 for S+2, [Ar III]λ7136 and [Ar III]λ7751 for Ar+2,
and [Fe III]λλ4986, 87 for F e+2. The PyNeb code adopts
the He I emissivities of Porter et al. (2012, 2013) includ-
ing collisional excitation, so no correction to the emis-
sion line ﬂuxes for this eﬀect (Clegg 1987) needs to be
applied. The He I λ7065 line, which has a strong con-
tribution from collisional excitation, was not included
in the computation of the He+; in fact, the uncertain-
ties on the derived ne values translate into large errors
on the He+ abundance due to the strong dependence of
the He I λ7065 emissivity on density (see e.g. Fig. 4 of
Porter et al. 2012).

To get an estimate of the ion abundance uncertainties,
we ran the getIonAbundance task for ranges of tempera-
tures, densities, and ﬂux ratios within the ±1σ levels, and
conservatively adopted the maximum excursion around
the nominal abundance value as our error. When multi-
ple sets of lines were available for a single ion (i.e. He+,
O+, O0, S+2, Ar+2), its abundance was computed by av-
eraging all the abundances from the various lines (or line
complexes). Typically, the standard deviation around
the mean abundance from the diﬀerent lines is lower than
or comparable with the error obtained by propagating
the individual abundance uncertainties; conservatively,
we adopted the largest value as our uncertainty on the
abundance determinations.

Total element abundances were derived from the abun-
dances of ions seen in the optical spectra using ioniza-
tion correction factors (ICFs). For Oxygen, the total
abundance was computed as O/H = (O+ + O+2)/H +.
From Izotov et al. (2006), the contribution of O+3 to the
total oxygen abundance is expected to be <1%, since
O+/(O+ + O+2) > 0.1 in our H II regions. We did not
add the contribution from O0 because it is associated
to neutral hydrogen, and almost all the emission in the
[O I] λ6300, 6364 lines comes from photodissociation re-
gions (Abel et al. 2005).

To compute the abundances of the other elements, we
adopted the ICFs from Izotov et al. (2006) for the “high”
Z regime (12 + log O/H ≥ 8.2):

ICF (N +) = −1.476v + 1.752 + 0.688/v,

ICF (N e+2) = −0.591w + 0.927 + 0.546/w,

ICF (S+ + S+2) = 0.178v + 0.610 + 0.153/v,

ICF (Ar+2) = 0.517v + 0.763 + 0.042/v,

ICF (F e+2) = −1.377v + 1.606 + 1.045/v

Chemical abundances were derived assuming a three-

for the electron temperature structure:
the [O III] temperature was adopted for the highest-

the
[S III] temperature for the intermediate-ionization zone
(S+2, Ar+2), and the [O II] temperature for the
low-ionization zone (O0, O+, N +, S+, F e+2). For
Te[O III] and Te[S III], we used the temperatures di-
rectly derived from the [O III]λ4363/λλ4959, 5007 and
[S III]λ6312/λλ9069, 9532 line ratios. For the [O II] tem-
perature, instead, in view of the problems observed in the
Te[O II] versus Te[O III] plane, we used the relation from
Garnett (1992):

,

Te[O II] = 0.70 × Te[O III] + 3000 K,

an approach that is widely applied in the literature
to reduce the uncertainty in the [O II] temperature de-
termination (e.g. Kennicutt et al. 2003; Bresolin 2011;
Berg et al. 2015). However, we caution that the errors
on the [O II] temperature derived with this model-based
relation are formal errors obtained by propagating the
Te[O III] uncertainties, without assigning any error to
the temperature calibration itself; as a consequence, the
errors on Te[O II] may be underestimated, a problem that
has been discussed by previous studies (e.g. H¨agele et al.
2006).

In H II-6, where the He II λ4686 nebular emission line
was clearly detected (see Fig. 20), the He abundance was
computed as He+ + He+2 (with He+2 contributing for
∼1% to the total He abundance), while we neglected the
He+2 contribution in all the other H II regions. We notice
that a modest nebular He II λ4686 emission could be
present in H II-1, superimposed upon a much stronger
Wolf-Rayet broad emission component (see Section 5 and
Table 4); however, since this nebular He II contribution
turns out very small, and is furthermore aﬀected by large
uncertainties due to the dominating WR component, we
decided to neglect it in the computation of the total He
abundance for region H II-1.

To derive the total abundance of He, one should in
principle account for the ionization structure of the neb-
ula. In fact, the radius of the He+ zone can be smaller
than the radius of the H + zone in the case of soft ionizing
radiation, or larger in the case of hard radiation. In the
former case, a correction for unseen neutral helium needs
to be applied, resulting in a ionization correction factor
ICF (He++He+2) > 1 (Izotov et al. 2007). Izotov et al.
(2013) ran photoionization models to investigate the be-
havior of ICF (He+ + He+2) as a function of metallicity
and excitation parameter w. According to their “high” Z
models, ICF (He+ + He+2) approaches unity for large w
values and ICF ∼1.03 for w ∼0.3. Since w > 0.3 in our
H II regions, it is reasonable to neglect this correction.

detected in all ﬁve PNe. We excluded PN 4 from our
study since its 2D spectra appeared highly contaminated
from diﬀuse emission due to nearby H II regions. For
all the other PNe, we obtained [O III] temperatures in
the range 12,000 - 14,000 K. Densities were derived for
PN 1, PN 2 and PN 3 with large errors (ne = 600+500
−400,
cm−3), while for PN 5, where the
300+400
[S II]λλ6716, 31 lines were not detected, we assumed ne =
1000 cm−3. Following the same approach adopted by
many studies in the literature (e.g. Stasi´nska et al. 2013;
Idiart et al. 2007), we assumed that the temperature of
all the ions is equal to Te[OIII]. In fact, empirical rela-
tions between Te[O III] and Te[ N II] derived in the liter-
ature for PNe (Kaler 1986; Kingsburgh & Barlow 1994;
Wang & Liu 2007) show important spreads and have dif-
ferent trends.

For all the PNe but PN 4, we derived the abundances
of He+, N +, O+, O+2, and N e+2 from the He I λ5876,
[N II]λ6548,84, [O II]λλ3726,29, [O III]λ4959, 5007 and
[Ne III] λ3869 lines; S+, S+2, and Ar+2 abundances
were derived for PN 1, PN 2, and PN 3 from the
[S II]λλ6716,31, [S III]λ9069, and [Ar III]λ7136 lines;
He+2 abundances were obtained only for PN 2 and PN 3
from the He II λ4686 line. For these two PNe, the total
He abundance was computed as He+ + He+2, while the
He+2 contribution was omitted for PN 1 and PN 5.

To derive total element abundances, we used the ICFs
from Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994), hereafter KB94. For
oxygen, the correction due to unseen O+3 is:

ICF (O+ + O++) =

He+ + He+2

Densities and temperatures of PNe were derived using
the density-sensitive [S II]λ6716/λ6731 line ratio, and
the temperature-sensitive [O III]λ4363/λλ4959 + 5007
ratio. Figure 3 shows that the [O III]λ4363 line was

The absence of He II lines in PN 1 and PN 5 indicates
negligible He+2 abundances, and thus we do not expect
an important amount of O+3 in these two objects. On
the other hand, we derived ICF (O+ + O++) ∼ 1.1 and

with respect to previous ICFs for PNe. We present in
the Appendix a description of the new ICFs and evalu-
ate the eﬀect on the derived PN abundances. We ﬁnd
that oxygen is very little aﬀected by the new ICFs, with
abundance diﬀerences of only a few percent in dex. For
the other elements, i.e. N, Ne, S and Ar, the diﬀerence in
abundance is larger than for O, but always within ∼0.1
dex, comparable to the errors associated with our derived
abundances.

5. WOLF-RAYET FEATURES

According to stellar evolution models, the most mas-
sive stars (M ∼> 20M⊙, for a solar metallicity model
with rotation, see Meynet & Maeder 2005) evolve into
the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase ≈2-5 Myr after their birth.
A WR star is a bare stellar core that has lost the
main part of its H-rich envelope via strong winds (e.g.
Maeder 1991; Maeder & Conti 1994), or by mass trans-
fer through the Roche Lobe in close binary systems (e.g.
Chiosi & Maeder 1986). The characteristic features of
WR stars are broad emission lines of helium, nitrogen,

carbon and oxygen formed in the high-velocity wind re-
gion surrounding the hot stellar photosphere. In the op-
tical, two main emission features can be identiﬁed: the
so-called blue bump around 4600 - 4700 ˚A, and the red
bump centered around 5800 ˚A, usually fainter than the
blue bump. The blue bump is due to the blend of a broad
He II λ4686 ˚A emission feature with N III λ4640 ˚A (WN
subtype) or with C III λ4652 ˚A (WC subtype). The
red bump is due to the C IV λ5808 ˚A emission in WC
stars, and is more rarely observed than the blue bump.
The WN and WC subtypes represent an evolutionary se-
quence since the ejection process is believed to occur in
succession, ﬁrst exposing the surface mainly composed of
the nitrogen-rich products of the CNO cycle (WN stars),
and later the carbon-rich layer due to He-burning (WC
and WO) (Dray et al. 2003, and references therein).

We detected the blue bump in two (H II -1 and H II
-4) out of the six H II regions studied in NGC 4449. On
the other hand, the wavelength range of the red bump
falls close to the region of low sensitivity of the blue
and red MODS detectors, preventing us to draw con-
clusions about the presence of this feature. The blue
bump spectral region in H II-1 and H II-4 was modeled
by simultaneously ﬁtting the WR features (N III λ4640,
C III λ4652, He II λ4686) and the nebular emission
lines ([Fe III] λ4658, He II λ4686, [Ar IV]+He I λ4713,
[Ar IV]λ4740) following an approach similar to that of
Brinchmann et al. (2008). To evaluate the underlying
stellar continuum, we performed a spectral energy dis-
tribution (SED) ﬁt to the 4000-7000 ˚A range (avoiding
the regions contaminated by nebular emission lines) us-
ing SSP models from the Padova group (Marigo et al.
2008; Chavez et al. 2009). The SED of H II -1 and H II
-4 turned out to be best reproduced by a Z=0.004, 3-4
Myr old population; this result, which we expect to be
highly aﬀected by the age-metallicity degeneracy, is not
intended to draw conclusions on the physical properties
of the underlying stars, but has the mere purpose of pro-
viding a reliable continuum below the bump. The ﬁts to
the blue bump in regions H II-1 and H II-4 are shown
in Figures 9 and 10, respectively. We ﬁxed the nebular

were allowed to vary as free parameters.

feature is best ﬁtted with a Gaussian FWHM of ∼30 ˚A,
corresponding to a velocity σ ∼800 km s−1 8; the pres-
ence of a nebular contribution to this line is not well
constrained given the large errors (see Table 4). Sur-
prisingly, the N III λ4640 and C III λ4652 features show
widths comparable to those of the nebular emission lines.
A similar result was found by Smith et al. (2016) when
ﬁtting the WR blue bump for cluster #5 in the blue
compact dwarf galaxy NGC 5253; as they noticed, the
narrow widths derived for N III and C III would sug-
gest that these lines are likely to be nebular in origin,
although detecting these transitions is unusual.

For region H II-4, it was necessary to assume two broad
emission components to obtain a satisfactory ﬁt to the
He II λ4686 feature: our best ﬁt provides two Gaussians
with FWHMs of ∼8 ˚A and ∼ 45 ˚A, corresponding to
velocities of ∼200 km s−1 and ∼1200 km s−1, while the
N III and C III features are reproduced by two Gaus-
sians with FWHM∼8 ˚A. Notice that wind velocities de-
rived in WR stars can be as high as ∼2500 km s−1 (e.g.,

We show in Figure 11 a comparison of the WR fea-
tures in H II-1 and H II-4 against the Starburst99 in-
stantaneous burst models (Leitherer et al. 2014). For
region H II-1, we do not show the ratios involving the
C III and N III emission because, as previously dis-
cussed, the narrow widths derived for these lines would
suggest that they are nebular in origin and not due to
WR stars. The plotted models were computed with the
Geneva Z = 0.008 stellar tracks (Schaller et al. 1992;
Meynet et al. 1994) assuming either a standard mass-
loss (SML) or a high mass-loss (HML) rate.
It is well
known that models of massive stars suﬀer uncertain-
ties due to rotation (e..g Meynet & Maeder 2005) and
to possible binary evolution (e.g. Eldridge et al. 2008;
Vanbeveren et al. 2007). Models including rotation have
been computed by the Geneva group for some metallici-
ties, but are not available for Z = 0.008.

Figure 11 shows that WR features (mainly C III, N III
and He II λ4686) are visible during a limited age range,
from ≈1 Myr to ≈4.5 Myr in the case of SML models, and
up to ≈6 Myr for HML models. While the N III emission
is always present during the WR phase, the C III emis-
sion due to the later appearance of WC stars is observed
only after ≈3 Myr (top panel of Fig. 11). This holds
both for the SML and for the HML models, although
we notice that the latter ones imply signiﬁcantly higher
F(C III)/F(N III) ratios. The presence of broad C III
emission in H II-4 indicates the existence of a WR popu-
lation at least ≈ 3 Myr old. The behaviour of the F(He II
λ4686)/F(N III) ratio is displayed in the middle panel of
Fig. 11. The SML and HML models predict a moderate
diﬀerence in this ratio. The F(He II)/F(N III) ratio is
as high as ∼10 in the earliest phases, and then rapidly
decreases after ∼3 Myr reaching down to ∼2. For H II-
4, we derive a ratio of ∼ 6 ± 2, compatible with an age
of ∼3 Myr. Finally, the bottom panel of Fig. 11 shows
the evolution of the F(He II λ4686)/F(Hβ) ratio, which is
proportional to the number of WR stars over the number
of ionizing OB stars. Here the diﬀerence between the two
sets of models is striking: while the SML largely under-
predict the number of WR over OB stars, the HML pro-
vide a very satisfactory match for ages older than ≈4 Myr
for both H II-1 and H II-4. This is in agreement with past
studies in the literature showing that the observed prop-
erties of WR stars require, in absence of stellar models
with rotation, the inclusion of an enhanced mass loss (e.g.
Schaller et al. 1992; Schaerer & Maeder 1992). However,
we caution that the diﬃculty of the models in reproduc-
ing the strength of the blue bump could be due to the
presence of stars other than “classical” WR, such as mas-
sive, mass losing core-hydrogen burning stars close to the
main sequence, a stellar phase not yet accounted for in
the evolution models (Leitherer et al. 2017). Using the
HML models we derive, from the observed He II λ4686
ﬂux, a number of WR stars of ≈ 4 and ≈ 8 ± 2 in regions
H II-1 and H II-4, respectively.

6. RESULTS ON THE CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES AND

ABUNDANCE RATIOS

Element abundances derived in H II regions and
PNe are given in Tables 7 and 8.
The oxy-
gen abundance interval spanned by our sample is
8.3 ± 0.1 ≤ 12 + log(O/H) ≤ 8.46 ± 0.03, with average O
abundances for H II regions and PNe of 8.37 ± 0.05 and

15

8.3 ± 0.1, respectively. The H II region results are con-
sistent with previous literature measurements based on
the direct temperature method: Talent (1980), see also
Skillman et al. (1989), derived an average oxygen abun-
dance of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.31 ± 0.07 for H II regions in
NGC 4449; later, Berg et al. (2012) obtained new MMT
spectra for the bright H II knot located a few arcsec to the
south of our H II-6 region (slit 10 in Figure 1), and found
an average abundance of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.20 ± 0.08,
consistent with our value of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.32 ± 0.04
within the errors.

The trend of H II region and PN abundance ratios ver-
sus total oxygen abundance is illustrated in Figure 12.
We ﬁnd that, within the oxygen interval spanned by our
data, the Ne/O, S/O and Ar/O ratios are similar for
the H II region and PN sub-samples, and are compati-
ble, within the errors, with a constant trend as a func-
tion of oxygen (Figs 12b, 12c and 12d). This behaviour
is consistent with what is commonly observed in other
studies (e.g., Richer & McCall 2007; Bresolin et al. 2010;
Stasi´nska et al. 2013; Annibali et al. 2015). The expla-
nation is that α-elements are all synthesized by massive
stars on similar timescales, thus their abundance vari-
ations occur in lockstep, maintaining the correspond-
ing ratios constant. The similarity between the Ne/O,
S/O and Ar/O ratios measured in PNe and H II re-
gions is not surprising since α - elements are not sig-
niﬁcantly aﬀected during the evolution of low and in-
termediate mass stars. In NGC 4449, the average val-
ues of < log(N e/O) >≃ −0.73, < log(S/O) >≃ −1.72,
and < log(Ar/O) >≃ −2.40 are consistent with typical
abundance ratios derived in H II regions of star-forming
dwarf galaxies (see Figure 13 of Annibali et al. 2015, for
NGC 1705).

The major abundance diﬀerence between H II re-
gions and PNe is observed for Nitrogen (Figure 12a),
showing a dichotomy in the N/O distribution. Our
H II regions exhibit an average < log(N/O)H II >≃
−1.35, comparable to values measured in H II regions
of luminous dwarf galaxies (e.g. Kobulnicky & Skillman
1996; Berg et al. 2012) and of spirals for similar oxy-
gen abundances as in NGC 4449 (e.g. Bresolin et al.
2009a; Berg et al. 2015; Croxall et al. 2016). On the
other hand, our PNe are more than ≃1 dex enhanced
in N with respect to H II regions, with an average
< log(N/O)P N e >≃ −0.12. This is not unusual since
previous studies have shown that PNe in nearby galaxies
are enriched in N with respect to H II regions; there is a
large scatter in the amount of the enrichment, with N/O
ratios from close to those measured in H II regions up to
≈ 1 dex higher (e.g. Pe˜na et al. 2007; Richer & McCall
2007, 2008; Bresolin et al. 2010; Stasi´nska et al. 2013;
Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. 2016). Highly N-enriched PNe are
found both in star-forming galaxies and in quiescent
early-type galaxies, where star formation ceased a long
time ago (e.g. Richer & McCall 2008). However, we no-
tice that our PNe, despite their signiﬁcant N enrichment,
do not appear to be enhanced in He (Fig. 12f); to our
knowledge, there are no models that can simultaneously
increase the N abundance by a factor of 10 and leave He
unchanged (see e.g. Karakas & Lattanzio 2007). A pos-
sible explanation is that our derived PN He abundances
are uncertain because the detected He I λ5876 line is sig-
niﬁcantly fainter than two nearby sky lines at λ ∼ 5867

˚A and λ ∼ 5890 ˚A.

From the theoretical point of view, the N/O enhance-
ment in PNe is the natural consequence of nitrogen be-
ing mostly synthesized in intermediate mass stars, that
are the PN progenitors, and brought to the stellar sur-
face during dredge-up episodes occurring in the RGB and
AGB phases; a signiﬁcant N production may also occur
in the most massive and luminous AGB stars through
HBB (see Section 1). PNe exhibiting the most ex-
treme N (and He) abundances, classiﬁed as type I, are
thought to be the descendants of massive (> 3 M⊙), rel-
atively young (age.400 Myr) AGB stars experiencing
HBB (e.g. Stanghellini et al. 2006; Corradi & Schwarz
1995). Torres-Peimbert & Peimbert (1997) proposed
log(N/O) > −0.42 and He/H> 0.105 as an empirical
criterion to select type I systems; three PNe out of four
in our sample satisfy the condition in N/O, but their
helium abundances are similar to those of H II regions
around He/H≃0.09 (see Figure 12f), which can not be
explained with existing models. Although the reliability
of the derived He abundances for our PNe could be ques-
tioned as discussed before, a strong selection bias should
be invoked to explain why a fraction as high as 3/4 of
our sample derives from massive star progenitors.

We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant trends in the N/O vs O/H dis-
tribution of Figure 12a. Historically, the absence of a
trend in N/O vs O/H for low-metallicity systems was
taken as the ﬁrst indication that nitrogen cannot be a

pure secondary element. Primary elements (like He, C
and O) are those whose production can start already in
stars with primordial initial chemical composition. Sec-
ondary elements are those that can be synthesized only
if the star already contains their seed elements at birth
or at the evolutionary phase when the physical condi-
tions allow the element to be synthesized. As a natural
consequence, the abundance of secondary elements is pre-
dicted to increase as the square of primary ones (Tinsley
1980). Hence, had N been of fully secondary nature, its
ratio to oxygen should have been proportional to the O
abundance. Since N/O is instead always found to be
quite independent of O/H in the nebulae of individual
galaxies (see, e.g. Diaz & Tosi 1986), a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of N must be of primary origin.
In practice, its
nature depends on whether the C used to synthesize N
was produced by previous nuclear reactions in the same
star or was already present in its initial chemical compo-
sition. An inspection of the chemical yields computed for
low- and intermediate-mass stars (see e.g. Karakas 2010;
Ventura et al. 2013; Vincenzo et al. 2016) shows that N
is mainly of secondary origin above a metallicity ≈ half
of solar, and is mainly produced by M ∼> 3.5M⊙ stars ex-
periencing HBB (see also Figs 1 and 2 in Romano et al.
2010). In massive stars N can have a signiﬁcant primary
origin if their metallicity is low and they rotate suﬃ-
ciently fast (Meynet & Maeder 2002).

Finally, the distribution of the Fe abundance, derived

too compressed.

only for H II regions, is shown in Figure 12e. The Fe/O
ratio shows no clear trend with oxygen: in fact, although
there is a hint for an Fe/O decrease with increasing O
abundance, in agreement with the behaviour revealed by
other studies (e.g., Izotov et al. 2006; Guseva et al. 2011;
Delgado-Inglada et al. 2011) and commonly interpreted
as Fe depletion into dust grains, the range in oxygen
abundance probed by our data is likely too small to claim
a clear trend. In particular, we notice that the data in
the Fe/O versus O plane shown by Delgado-Inglada et al.
(2011) span an oxygen interval of almost ∼2 dex, com-
pared to a range of only ∼0.2 dex for the NGC 4449 data.
Our Fe and O abundances nicely fall upon the region
occupied by H II regions in the Delgado-Inglada et al.
(2011) plot.

7. RESULTS ON THE ABUNDANCE SPATIAL

DISTRIBUTIONS

The behaviour of element abundances as a function
of galacto-centric distance is shown in Figure 13. For
immediate comparison between NGC 4449 and other lit-
erature studies, the radial distance is expressed in terms
of R/R25, where the optical isophotal radius R25 = 3.1′
is taken from Pilyugin et al. (2015), and corresponds to
≈3.4 kpc at NGC 4449’s distance of ≈ 3.8 Mpc.

Figure 13a shows that H II regions and PNe exhibit
similar oxygen abundances in the galacto-centric dis-
tance range of overlap, despite the fact that they rep-
resent diﬀerent evolutionary stages of the galaxy. The
same result was found for other star-forming dwarf
and spiral galaxies by previous studies reporting sim-
ilar abundances for H II regions and bright PNe (e.g.

18

Richer 1993; Magrini et al. 2005; Richer & McCall 2007;
Bresolin et al. 2010; Stasi´nska et al. 2013). From the
analysis of the CMD of the resolved stars, we know
that NGC 4449 has been actively forming stars over the
last 1 Gyr (Annibali et al. 2008; McQuinn et al. 2010;
Sacchi et al. 2017); therefore we would expect a signiﬁ-
cant chemical enrichment since the PN progenitors were
formed, i.e. since ∼100 Myr ago or more. On the other
hand, the similarity in oxygen abundance between H II
regions and PNe suggests that this is not the case. The
galactic outﬂow observed in NGC 4449 (Della Ceca et al.
1997; Summers et al. 2003; Bomans & Weis 2014) may
have played an important role, expelling the recently
produced α-elements. Accretion of metal poor gas or
acquisition of smaller gaseous systems may have also con-
tributed to dilute the metals in the ISM.

Figure 13a illustrates that both H II regions and PNe
show a well-deﬁned oxygen gradient. We thus combined
H II and PN data to infer a global relation from a linear
least-squares ﬁt:
12 + log(O/H) = −0.29(±0.06) × R/R25 + 8.49(±0.030).
(15)
Hence our gradient is (−0.29 ± 0.08) dex R−1
9, in good
25
agreement with the value of (−0.23 ± 0.03) dex R−1
25 ob-
tained by Pilyugin et al. (2015), once we correct his O/H
gradient for the larger distance adopted in his work
(DNGC 4449 ≈ 4.1 Mpc). On the other hand, we notice
that the central extrapolated oxygen abundance derived
by Pilyugin et al. (2015) is 12 + log(O/H) = 8.26 ± 0.01,
more than 0.2 dex lower than ours.

The presence of metallicity gradients in late-type dwarf
galaxies has been widely discussed in the literature. For
a long time, dIrrs and BCDs have been considered to
have nearly constant radial trends, at least within the
observational uncertainties (e.g., Kobulnicky & Skillman
1997; Croxall et al. 2009; Lagos & Papaderos 2013;
Haurberg et al. 2013). Two possible explanations have
been proposed for this behaviour: (a) the ejecta from
stellar winds and supernovae are dispersed and mixed
across the ISM on short timescales, of the order of
. 107 year; (b) freshly synthesized elements remain
unmixed with the surrounding ISM and reside in a
hot 106 K phase or a cold, dusty, molecular phase
(Kobulnicky & Skillman 1997). However, detections of
negative metallicity gradients from stars and H II re-
gions have been reported in the literature for the dIrr
NGC 6822 (Venn et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2006), and spec-
troscopic studies of individual RGB stars have shown
slightly negative gradients in [Fe/H] for the SMC, the
LMC, and the dIrr WLM (Leaman et al. 2014, and
references therein). Very recently, our study of the
BCD NGC 1705 (Annibali et al. 2015) and the study
by Pilyugin et al. (2015) showed that negative nebu-
lar metallicity gradients are indeed present in late-type
dwarf galaxies; our results for NGC 4449 reinforce this
scenario. We suspect that these recent studies were able
to reveal gradients previously undetected thanks to the
high-quality data implied, allowing for much smaller un-
certainties on the element abundance determinations.

Figures 13d, 13e, and 13f show a constant trend of the

9 or (−0.09 ± 0.05) dex R
tance R in Kpc is considered.

−1
Kpc if the actual galactocentric dis-

Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O abundance ratios with galacto-
centric distance, which, as described in Section 6, is ex-
pected because α-elements are all synthesized by massive
stars on similar timescales and vary in lockstep. Also
the He abundance remains constant with galacto-centric
distance (Figure 13h), in agreement with the absence of
any trend of He with oxygen in Figure 12f. On the other
hand, Fe/O decreases with increasing galacto-centric dis-
tance (Figure 13g), which is expected from the presence
of an oxygen radial gradient and from the fact that Fe/O
decreases with increasing O in Figure 12e.

Figure 13b and 13c show the radial distribution of the
N abundance and of the N/O ratio, respectively. The
behaviour of nitrogen in Figures 13b and 13c deserves
particular discussion. In fact, despite the existence of a
well-deﬁned oxygen metallicity gradient in Figure 13a,
no clear trend of the N abundance with galacto-centric
distance is observed for H II regions. This behaviour
is surprising, since we expect that the present ISM in
NGC 4449 contains a signiﬁcant component of secondary
N (see e.g. Vincenzo et al. 2016), implying that an oxy-
gen metallicity gradient should be accompanied by a ni-
trogen gradient at least as steep (see for instance studies
of spiral galaxies, e.g. Diaz & Tosi 1986; Bresolin et al.
2009a; Croxall et al. 2015).

Given the evidence for a conspicuous population of
WR stars in NGC 4449 (Martin & Kennicutt 1997;
Bietenholz et al. 2010; Srivastava et al. 2014; Sokal et al.
2015, see also Section 5),
local pollution from WR
ejecta enriched in N is an attractive possibility to ex-
plain the observed behaviour. Although signiﬁcant
amounts of N and C are expected to be injected by
WR stars on theoretical grounds (e.g. Chiosi & Maeder
1986; Dray & Tout 2003; Meynet & Maeder 2005), ob-
servational results have been discrepant so far, sug-
gesting either the absence (Kobulnicky & Skillman 1996;
Kobulnicky 1999b) or the presence (Kobulnicky et al.
1997; L´opez-S´anchez et al. 2007, 2011; James et al. 2011,
2013) of localised metal enrichment by massive star
ejecta. A proposed explanation for these ambiguous
results is that an N/O excess is observed only after a
recently completed WR phase, when the WR features
are weak and the ejecta have cooled.
In this picture,
strong WR features trace very young regions where the
stellar ejecta are still in a hot (T≈ 106 K) phase and
do not show up in optical spectroscopy of H II regions
(Tenorio-Tagle 1996; Woﬀord 2009). This scenario is
supported by a study of a large galaxy sample from the
SDSS (Brinchmann et al. 2008) where an excess in N/O
is found for WR galaxies with EW(Hβ)<100 ˚A (i.e. burst
ages ∼> 6 Myr), while WR and non-WR galaxies do not
show diﬀerence in N/O for EW(Hβ)>100 ˚A (i.e. burst
ages .6 Myr). Indeed, the two regions with strong WR
features in our sample (H II-1 and H II-4) do not exhibit
particularly high N/O values, while H II-6, which does
not have WR features but is located in a region of very
active SF, presents an N/O excess. Whether there is a
correlation in NGC 4449 between the age of the burst and
the N abundance for the individual H II regions will be
investigated in a forthcoming paper (Sacchi et al. 2017)
based on UV LEGUS data (Calzetti et al. 2015).

8. DISTINCTIVE PROPERTIES OF THE PN POPULATION

0.3 and the color (B − V )N 4449
= 0.36 ± 0.07 of
NGC 4449 are taken from the corresponding RC3
(de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) and Gronwall et al. (2004)
entries, assuming a Galactic foreground reddening of
E(B − V ) = 0.019 (Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis 1998).
A match of these ﬁgures with the Buzzoni (2005) Im
template galaxy model (see Table A7 therein) suggests
a bolometric correction in the range (Bol − V ) =
−0.84 ± 0.02, from which an absolute value of Mbol =
−19.3 ± 0.3 and a total bolometric luminosity of L =
(4.0 ± 1.0) 109 L⊙ can be obtained, once accounting for
the galaxy distance modulus, and assuming for the Sun
M bol

⊙ = +4.72 (Lang 1980).
Our PN completeness level can be estimated by re-
lying on the classical Henize & Westerlund (1963) PN
luminosity function (PNLF), in the form of an expo-
nential curve with a sharp truncation designed to ac-
comodate the bright end (cf. e.g. Ciardullo et al. 1989;
Jacoby & De Marco 2002). An absolute M[O III] mag-
nitude (at 10 pc) can be derived for each nebula in
our spectroscopic sample, according to the observed
[O III] ﬂux of Table 3, corrected for the distance mod-
ulus of (m − M )0 ∼ 27.9 (Annibali et al. 2008), as
M[O III] = −2.5 log F[O III] − 13.74. These ﬁgures
can be contrasted with the bright cut-oﬀ magnitude
(M∗
[O III]) of Ciardullo et al. (1989) PNLF that, for the
NGC 4449 metallicity, can be set at M ∗
[O III] = −4.36
(Ciardullo et al. 2002). Our results are summarized in
Table 9 and Fig. 14.

The ﬁgure also provides a mapping between MF 555W
magnitudes and M[O III] magnitudes for the ﬁve plane-
tary nebulae with spectroscopy. For this task we relied
on the observed mF 555W magnitudes, after correcting
the Table 9 entries for distance modulus. As expected,
the MF 555W magnitude of the ﬁve spectroscopic nebu-
lae happens to be a quite conﬁdent proxy of the corre-
sponding M[O III], with M[O III] = MF 555W + 0.5 ± 0.1
(see Fig. 14). When applied to the remaining photomet-
ric targets, one can therefore conclude that our observa-
tions sample the bright tail of NGC 4449 PNLF, down
to (M[O III] − M ∗

[O III]) ∼ 2.5 mag.

Adopting the standard PNLF, as scaled for instance
from the M31 (Ciardullo et al. 1989) or LMC observa-
tions (Reid & Parker 2010) down to ∼ 8 mag fainter
than the bright cut-oﬀ limit M ∗
[O III], we obtain a to-
tal expected number of 280 ± 53 (Poissonian rms) PNe
for our ﬁeld. A lower value of ∼ 145 ± 27 would be
obtained assuming instead the SMC PNLF, as from
the deep [O III]5007 observations of Jacoby & De Marco
(2002). These values need to be corrected for the fact
that we are missing the PNe in the most crowded, central
R/R25 . 0.1 galaxy regions: adopting the galaxy surface
brightness proﬁle of Rich et al. (2012), we estimate a ∼40
% correction to the PN number, which translates into
392 ± 74 for an assumed Ciardullo et al. (1989) PNLF
(or 203 ± 38 PNe assuming the SMC PNLF). We caution
that these estimates are highly uncertain because our ex-
trapolation assumes that our sample is proportional to
the complete sample from the brightest PN down to ∼2.5
mag below the PNLF cutoﬀ; indeed a robust determina-
tion of the PN completeness as a function of magnitude
would require artiﬁcial star tests performed on the im-

In the plot each nebula is labeled according to its entry ID of
Table 9.

Further insights on the overall evolutionary status of
the PNe in NGC 4449 can be attained by considering
the full sample of 28 bona ﬁde candidates examined either
with spectroscopic or with photometric observations (see
Table 9). The statistics is aﬀected by a selection bias,
since our PN detection is restrained only to the most
active objects with prominent [O III] emission at 5007 ˚A
(for the target to clearly stand out in the V or F502N
band frames, compared to B and I imaging). Notice that
younger stars do not produce brighter [O III] planetary
nebulae; however, at NGC 4449’s metallicity and lower,
the highest luminosity that a PN can attain increases
with increasing oxygen abundance (Dopita et al. 1992;
Richer 1993). Therefore, we can not exclude that our
selection criterium has picked-up only the most oxygen-
rich PNe in NGC 4449.

Within the biased and limited size of our sample,
a preliminary, yet useful, estimate of the luminosity-
speciﬁc PN number density α = NP N /Lgal (Jacoby
1980) may be attempted. This parameter directly relates
the amount of light in a stellar system to be associated
to any observed PN sample, and it closely traces the dis-
tinctive evolutionary properties of the underlying stellar
population in the parent galaxy. For this task we ﬁrst

Buzzoni, Arnaboldi, & Corradi (2006).
In the plot
we also report the theoretical predictions for Buzzoni
(2005) template galaxy models, between 2 and 15
Gyr, according to Weidemann’s (2000) stellar mass-loss
scheme. The models predict that α decreases in young
and/or star-forming galaxies, compared to more quies-
cent early-type systems as a consequence of a smaller
population of PNe embedded in a higher galaxy lumi-
nosity per unit mass (i.e. a lower M/L ratio). We notice

that the luminosity-speciﬁc PN number in NGC 4449,
as well as the values derived for other late-type systems,
agree quite well with the Buzzoni (2005) models (on the
other hand, the models are less successful for the earliest
galaxy types).

From a theoretical point of view, the luminosity-
speciﬁc PN number density easily relates with the refer-
ence visibility lifetime (τP N ) of the PN events, being α =
B ×τP N , with B the so-called speciﬁc evolutionary ﬂux of
a stellar population (see Buzzoni, Arnaboldi, & Corradi
2006, for the theoretical background). The PN visibility
lifetime τP N depends both on the chemical and dynami-
cal properties of the ejected material, and on the stellar
core evolution during the PAGB phase. In general, for
young and intermediate-age SSPs, the PAGB timescale
(τP AGB) is shorter than the dynamical time-scale for the
nebula evaporation, so that the PN lifetime might likely
be shorter for more massive, and younger, stellar progen-
itors. This trend is schematically sketched in Fig. 15 rely-
ing on Buzzoni, Arnaboldi, & Corradi (2006) theoretical
framework. According to these models, the typical visi-
bility lifetime for the PNe in NGC 4449 is predicted to
be a few thousand years.

9. CONCLUSIONS
We presented new deep multi-object spectroscopy with
LBT/MODS of H II regions and PNe in the starburst ir-
regular galaxy NGC 4449, at a distance of ≈3.8 Mpc
from us. The [O III]λ4363 auroral line was detected in
all spectra, allowing for a direct determination of the
O+2 temperature. For the H II regions, the O+ and S+2
temperatures were also derived from the [O II]λ7320 +
λ7330/λ3726 + λ3729 and [S III]λ6312/λ9069 + λ9532
ratios. Using the “direct” method, we derived the abun-
dance of He, N, O, Ne, Ar, and S for six H II regions and,
for the ﬁrst time, for four PNe in NGC 4449. Iron abun-
dances were also derived for the H II regions, but this
element is notoriously highly aﬀected by depletion into
dust grains. The combined H II region and PN sample
covers a galacto-centric distance range of ∼2 kpc, corre-
sponding to ≈70% of the R25 isophotal radius. Our main
results are:

1. The total H II region + PN sample spans ∼0.2 dex
in oxygen abundance, with average 12 + log(O/H)
values of 8.37 ± 0.05 and 8.3 ± 0.1 for H II re-
gions and PNe, respectively. The results for the
H II regions are consistent, within the errors, with
previous literature estimates based on the direct
temperature method.

2. We ﬁnd a well deﬁned trend of decreasing oxy-
gen abundance with increasing galacto-centric dis-
tance: 12 + log(O/H) = −0.29(±0.06) × R/R25 +
8.49(±0.030), with H II regions and PNe exhibit-
ing similar oxygen abundances at the same galacto-
centric distance. This result, coupled with our
previous ﬁnding of a negative metallicity gradi-
ent for H II regions in the blue compact dwarf
NGC 1705 (Annibali et al. 2015) and with the re-
cent results by Pilyugin et al. (2015), suggests that
metallicity gradients do exist in irregular galaxies,
at odds with what was previously believed (e.g.
Kobulnicky & Skillman 1997; Croxall et al. 2009;
Haurberg et al. 2013; Lagos & Papaderos 2013).

3. Despite the presence of a negative oxygen gradient,
nitrogen does not exhibit any well-deﬁned radial
trend. This is unexpected, since an important com-
ponent of secondary nitrogen should exist in the
present-day ISM of NGC 4449. Building on pre-
vious literature studies showing evidence for N/O
inhomogeneities in Wolf-Rayet galaxies, we suggest
that the anomalous nitrogen behaviour may be due
to local enrichment by the conspicuous Wolf-Rayet
population in NGC 4449.

4. The studied PNe exhibit a signiﬁcant nitrogen en-
hancement with respect to H II regions ( ∼> 1 dex);
this behaviour is in agreement with previous chem-
ical abundance studies of PNe in galaxies of diﬀer-
ent morphological types. On the other hand, we
also ﬁnd that the PN helium abundances are sim-
ilar to those of NGC 4449’ s H II regions, around
He/H≃0.09 (although we caution that our PN He
estimates are very uncertain because the detected
He I λ5876 line is signiﬁcantly fainter than two
nearby sky lines at λ ∼ 5867 ˚A and λ ∼ 5890 ˚A).
From the theoretical point of view, we expect both
N and He to be enhanced in PNe because they are
both synthesized and brought to the stellar surface
through dredge-up episodes occurring in the RGB
and AGB phases of intermediate mass stars. We
are not aware of any model producing a factor ∼10
enhancement in N while leaving He unchanged.

5. Our PN oxygen (and α-element, more in general)
abundances are, on the other hand, similar to those
of H II regions in the galacto-centric distance range
of overlap. This indicates that the NGC 4449’s ISM
has not been signiﬁcantly enriched in metals since
the progenitors of the PNe were formed (i.e., since
∼ 100 Myr ago or more). Recently produced α-
elements may have been expelled from NGC 4449
by the galactic outﬂow, or may still reside in a hot
phase (see e.g. Martin et al. 2002, for NGC 1569);
also, acquisition of metal poor gas may have diluted
the metals in the ISM.

6. The derived luminosity-speciﬁc PN number density
(α = NP N /Lgal) in NGC 4449 agrees quite well
with the Buzzoni (2005) template galaxy models
that predict the behaviour of α as a function of
galaxy morphological type and color; according to
these models, the α value derived in NGC 4449
translates into a typical visibility lifetime for the
PN population of a few thousand years.

7. Two out of the six studied H II regions show broad
emission features associated with Wolf-Rayet stars
of WN and WC subtypes. From a comparison with
population synthesis models, we infer that a WR
population at least 3−4 Myr old must be present
in NGC 4449.

PN CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES WITH NEW IONIZATION CORRECTION FACTORS

Recently, Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014) (hereafter DMS14) presented new ionization correction factors (ICFs) for
PNe using a large grid of photoionization models covering a wide range of physical parameters. Analytical expressions
for the uncertainties associated with the new ICFs are also provided. We performed a comparison of the ICFs from
Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994) (KB94), used in Section 4.2 of this paper, with the new DMS14 recipes and evaluated
the eﬀect on the derived PN chemical abundances. Figure 25 shows the diﬀerence in abundance due to the use of the
new ICFs by DMS14 compared to the old ICFs by KB94.

For Helium, DMS14 suggest to calculate the He/H total abundance simply by adding He+/H+ and He++/H+, i. e.
neglecting any correction for neutral helium. This corresponds to the same approach that we adopted in Section 4.2,
therefore no comparison needs to be made for He.

For Oxygen, DMS14 propose:

where

and

O = (O+ + O++) × ICF (O+ + O++)

log ICF (O+ + O++) =

0.08v + 0.006v2
0.34 − 0.27v

,

v =

He++
(He+ + He++)

;

w =

O++
(O+ + O++)

.

(C1)

(C2)

(C3)

Equation C2 is valid for v ≤ 0.95 and thus applies to all our 4 PNe. Panel a) of Figure 25 shows that the diﬀerence
in O abundance due to the use of the new ICFs is very small (a few percent in dex) and largely below the errors
associated with the derived 12 + log(O/H) values.

For Nitrogen, DMS14 propose the following formulas valid only until w = 0.95:

where

when He II lines are detected, and

N
O

=

N +
O+

× ICF (N +/O+),

log ICF (N +/O+) = −0.16w(1 + logv)

log ICF (N +/O+) = 0.64w

(C4)

(C5)

(C6)

when He II lines are not detected. However, Eq. C6 may work ﬁne for matter bounded nebulae but not for radiation
bounded models and therefore the recommendation is to use the usual N/O = N +/O+ expression until the issue is
further explored (Delgado-Inglada, private communication). In our sample, the condition w ≤ 0.95 is only satisﬁed
by PN-2 and PN-3, with observed He II lines, and therefore we used Eq. C5 to compute the new abundances. Panel
b) of Figure 25 shows that the new N abundances tend to be lower than the previous ones; however, the diﬀerence is
within ∼0.1 dex, i. e. comparable to the uncertainty associated with the 12 + log(N/H) values.

For Neon, the abundance is:

N e
O

=

N e++
O++

× ICF (N e++/O++),

(C7)

where

29

ICF (N e++/O++) = w +

0.014
v′ + 2v′2.7
v′ = 0.01 if no He II lines are detected (PN-1 and PN-5) and v′ = v if v ≥ 0.015 (PN-2 and PN-3). Panel c) of
Figure 25 shows that the diﬀerence in Ne abundance is within ∼0.1 dex, smaller than the errors for the 12 + log(N e/H)
values; notice also the large uncertainties associated to the ICFs for Ne.

(0.7 + 0.2w − 0.8w2);

(C8)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

For Sulfur, we measure both S+ and S++ in PN-1, PN-2 and PN-3; therefore DMS14 provides:

3

S
O

=

S+ + S++
O+

× ICF ((S+ + S++)/O+),

where

log ICF ((S+ + S++)/O+) =

−0.02 − 0.03w − 2.31w2 + 2.19w3
0.69 + 2.09w − 2.69w2

if I(He II)/I(Hβ) ≥ 0.02 and

(C9)

(C10)

ICF ((S+ + S++)/O+) = 1
in all the other cases. We measure I(He II)/I(Hβ) ∼0.2 and ∼0.4 in PN-2 and PN-3, respectively, while for PN-1
we have only an upper limit of I(He II)/I(Hβ) < 0.03 from Table 3; therefore Eq. C10 is applied to all three PNe.
Panel d) of Figure 25 shows no systematic trend of the new S abundances with respect to the old ones; the diﬀerences
are within ∼0.1 dex, i.e. lower than the errors associated with the 12 + log(S/H) values.

(C11)

Finally, the DMS14 recipe for Argon is:

Ar = Ar++ ×

O
O+ + O++

× ICF (Ar++/(O+ + O++)

where, for w > 0.5 (i.e. PN-1, PN-2, PN-3, PN-5):

log ICF (Ar++/(O+ + O++) =

0.03w
0.4 − 0.3w

− 0.05.

(C12)

(C13)

Panel e) of Figure 25 shows again diﬀerences in the Ar abundances within ∼0.1 dex, smaller than the uncertainty

in the computed 12 + log(Ar/H) values.
