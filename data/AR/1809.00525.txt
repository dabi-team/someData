We  report  the  decisive  role  of  reactive  ion  impurities  in  low  energy  Ar+  ion  beam  on  surface 

nanopattern  formation.  The  source  of  experimental  inconsistency  in  pattern  formation  by  low 

energy (few keV to 10’s of KeV) Ar+ ion beam has been identified by irradiating Si surface at an 

oblique angle with pure and impure Ar+ ion beam of energy 3-10 keV. No well-defined patterns 

are observed for mass selected pure Ar+ ion bombardment, whereas well defined periodic ripple 

pattern  is  formed  by  the  same  experimental  condition  with  impure  mass  unanalyzed  Ar+  ion 

irradiation.  The  contaminants  in  mass  unanalyzed  beam  specifically  reactive  nitrogen,  oxygen 

and carbon play the main role of pattern formation by introducing chemical instability on the Si 

surface.  The  surface  morphology  of  the  irradiated  Si  surfaces  is  examined  by  Atomic  Force 

Microscopy  (AFM).  The  surface  contamination  and  corresponding  chemical  compound 

formation are investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

Introduction 

The pattern formation on Si surface by energetic ion bombardment has brought great interest in 

scientific  research  for  its  potential  applications.  Several  experimental  observations  of  ripple 

pattern formation have been reported on Si surface by varying ion species, energy (250 eV - 1 

keV)  and  incidence  angles  1-9.  As  the  Ar  ion  beam  is  very  common  for  surface  cleaning  and 

depth profiling in surface science experiments, several groups have reported pattern formation on 

Si surface by very low energy Ar+ ion (500 eV to 2 keV) bombardment 2,4-14, whereas the study 

is limited in the medium energy range 3 – 100 keV 15-29 as well pattern is observed only for Ar+ 

ion  energy  greater  than  20  keV  20-29.  It  is  interesting  that  nanopatterning  on  Si  by  Ar  beam  is 

suppressed in the energy range 3-20 keV 15-19,30. 

For very low energy (100 eV to 2 keV) Ar+ ion beam, ion guns are generally attached to 

the  vacuum  chambers  without  the  mass  filtering  system,  whereas  in  typical  ion  implanter  the 

energy  is  above  3  keV,  and  the  beam  is  usually  mass  analyzed  and  isotopically  pure.  The 

unfiltered ion beam  may  contain  N, C,  O and  other common impurities.  Pan et al.  31  observed 

silicon carbide (SiC) formation in  an ultra-high vacuum chamber by low energy (1.5 keV) Ar+ 

ion  incorporation;  although  they  did  not  study the  pattern  formation  and  role  of  contamination 

induced chemical effects on the pattern formation. Ziberi et al. also admitted that the dot pattern 

formation by noble ion bombardment might be due to the unintentional contaminations from the 

various sources  2,10,32,33. Hofsass and Engler pointed out the effect of contaminations on pattern 

formation,  though  that  contamination  comes  from  the  target  or  unintentional  incorporation  of 

impurity  on  the  sample  during  ion  bombardment  34-36.  Nevertheless,  the  contaminations  in  ion 

beam and consequent effects on nanopatterning have been overlooked.

In this article, we have investigated the pattern formation on Si by both the mass analyzed 

as well as unanalyzed ion beam and explored why the Si surface patterns are found in low energy 

unanalyzed beam and suppressed for  3-10 keV mass analyzed Ar+ ion beam. We report that the 

reactive impurities in the ion beam play the vital role in the pattern formation.  

 Experimental  

The  commercially  available  Si  (100)  wafers  of  size  1  cm  ×  1  cm  after  cleaning  with 

trichloroethylene  in  an  ultra-sonic  cleaner  were  irradiated  with  ion  energy  3  –  10  keV  Ar+  ion 

beam at oblique angle incidence from a 2.4 GHz ECR ion source of the Radioactive Ion Beam 

Facility at Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC), Kolkata. The irradiation was carried out 

in  two  different  ways  one  before  the  dipole  magnet,  i.e.  by  mass  unanalyzed  ion  beam  and 

another after the dipole magnet, i.e. by mass analyzed ion beam. The schematic diagram of the 

irradiation experimental set up is depicted in figure 1. The beam was collimated to get a uniform 

beam  of  8  mm  diameter  on  the  sample  surface  which  was  maintained  with  proper  secondary 

electron suppression for both the system. The pressure in the ECR chamber was around 510-7 

mbar  and  in  the  target  chamber,  it  was  310-7  mbar  during  the  ion  beam  experiment.  The 

morphology  of  all  the  irradiated  samples  was  investigated  in  air  using  Bruker  Atomic  Force 

Microscopy (AFM), Multi-Mode V at VECC, Kolkata.

The  compositional  change  of  the  irradiated  Si  (100)  samples  with  respect  to  virgin  Si 

surface was investigated by  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an Omicron Multi-

probe (Omicron Nano Technology, UK) ultrahigh vacuum(UHV) system (base pressure ∼ 5.0 × 

10−10 mbar). The system is equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα source with photons of energy 

1486.6 eV for XPS measurement. 

Results and discussions 

Figure 2 shows the surface morphology of mass analyzed Ar+ ion-bombarded Si surfaces 

with  different  ion  energy.  Fig.  2  (a)  –  (d)  show  the  AFM  images  of  3  –  10  keV  Ar+  ions 

bombarded  Si  surfaces  with  ion  fluence  7×1017  ions/cm2  at  an  incidence  angle  60o  with  the 

surface normal. The irradiated surfaces get amorphized after the irradiation and do not show any

pattern,  but  a  rough  surface  with  rms  roughness  below  1  nm.  The  rms  roughness  of  the  ion 

bombarded  surfaces  increases  slightly  with  ion  energy  which  is  shown  in  Figure  1  (e).  The 

absence of pattern on Si surface by low energy (keV) Ar+ ion bombardment at oblique angle was 

also  reported  earlier  19,30.  But,  the  explanation  for  the  absence  of  pattern  formation  in  these 

energy  regimes  is  not  substantial  as  the  patterns  are  easily  observed  by  other  groups  at  lower 

energies (< 2 keV) 1-9. Ziberi et al. reported the ripple pattern formation on Si by noble-gas ion 

beam (Ar+, Kr+, Xe+) below 2 keV ion energy and observed the absence of pattern by Ne+ ion 

beam  37.  They  concluded  that  the  mass  of  ion  plays  a  vital  role  in  pattern  formation.  If  mass, 

energy, angle of incidence and fluence of the projectile are only the factor of pattern formation, 

then  at  intermediate  energy  (~10  keV)  Ar  should  form  the  pattern.  This  inconsistency  is  still 

unexplained  for  low  energy  Ar+  ion  beam  induced  pattern  formation.  It  is  observed  that  the 

kinematics of the Ar+ ion with Si surface is not very much different for ion energy 1.3 to 10 keV, 

and  indicate  the  possibility  of  ripple  formation  in  all  this  energy  30.  So,  the  absence  of  pattern 

formation in the medium ion energy regime indicated that only the kinematics is not sufficient to 

develop  well-defined  patterns  on  the  surface,  hence,  the  additional  sources  of  instability,  i.e., 

initial  perturbation38,  presence  of  surfactant  34  or  beam  induced  impurity  19,39  are  to  be 

considered. To examine the source of instability, the chemistry of Ar+ ion-bombarded Si surface 

is investigated by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS).  

 Figure 3 shows the XPS spectra of mass analyzed 5 keV and 10 keV Ar+ ion-bombarded 

Si as well as virgin Si surface. It is clear from the figure that the surface chemical state of Si has 

not  changed  due  to  5  or  10  keV  mass  analyzed  Ar+  ion  bombardment.  The  oxide  peak  for  all 

three surfaces in figure 3 is for the native oxide layer, formed due to air exposure during sample 

transfer  from  the  implantation  chamber  to  the  XPS  system.  The  binding  energy  and 

6 

 
concentration  of  elemental  Si  and  SiOx  for  all  the  surfaces  are  mentioned  in  figure  3.  Similar 

oxide state at this binding energy was observed for oxide growth in Si NWs 40. The implantation 

of Ar atoms is confirmed by high-resolution Ar 2p core level XPS spectrum (figure 4 a). Ar 2p1/2 

and 2p3/2 are

clearly resolved with separation 2.1 eV which indicates inertness of Ar within the Si matrix. The 

distribution of implanted 5 keV  Ar atoms  at 60o in Si as a function of depth  is simulated by 

TRIM 41 and presented in figure 4 (b). Ar atoms during irradiation transfer its energy to the target 

material and penetrate up to a certain depth. Because of its inertness, it is only trapped in the Si 

surface. The two trapping mechanism for Ar in Si was given  42. In the first mechanism, the Ar 

atoms are trapped in vacancy sites whereas in the second mechanism it sits in interstitial sites. At 

low  energy,  Ar  atoms  are  trapped  mainly  in  interstitial  sites.  Similar  Ar  ion  trapping  was 

observed  in  Si  for  low  energy  ion  bombardment  31.  Bradley  and  Hofsaas  43    predicted  that  the 

presence  of  implanted  species  also  responsible  for  surface  instability,  however,  the  impact  is

lower than the sputtering and mass redistribution effects. Ripple formation on Si surface by Ar+ 

ion beam is only possible if the surface instability exceeds a threshold level. The threshold level 

can be achieved by Ar+ ion energy more than 10 keV 20-27 28,29, or at very high

fluence16,17.  Therefore,  Si  ripple  formation  by  Ar+  ions  of  energy  up  to  10  keV  at  moderate 

fluence  is  unlikely  as  sputtering,  mass  redistribution  of  Si  target  atoms  and  presence  of  inert 

implantations are not sufficient to generate instability  for surface pattern formation. Hofsaas el

al.  also  showed  that  due  to  very  low  growth  rate  of  parallel  ripple  pattern,  it  is  unlikely  to 

observe the pattern by Ar ion irradiation between 1.3 -10 keV for typical ion fluence up to about 

1018 ions/ cm2  30.  Presence of additional reactive atoms/ ions and subsequent surface chemical 

change  may  trigger  the  instability  by  altering  the  sputtering  and  mass  redistribution  effects, 

which enhances the growth rate of the parallel ripple patterns. 

To  verify  our  assumption,  we  bombard  the  Si  surfaces  by  unfiltered  impure  Ar+  beam 

similar to ion bombardment with ion guns without mass filtration.  We kept the same ion beam 

parameters  and  ion  surface  geometry  as  before.  The  experiments  were  performed  before  the 

dipole magnet (mass analyzer) as shown in Figure 1. The AFM morphologies of Si surfaces after 

the  bombardment  with  unanalyzed  3-10  keV  Ar+  beam  is  shown  in  figure  5  (a)  –  (d).  All  the 

bombarded  surfaces  show  well  periodic  nanoripple  pattern.  The  rms  roughness  and  ripple 

wavelength of the bombarded surfaces with ion energy are shown in figure 5 (e) and (f). The rms 

roughness of the surfaces with ion energy changes within ± 1 nm, whereas the ripple wavelength 

increases with ion energy as usual. 

To  investigate  the  possible  reason  of  nanopattern  formation  with  unanalyzed  ion  beam, 

we took the mass spectrum of the ion beam as well as  investigated the irradiated Si surface by 

XPS. The XPS survey of 5 keV and 10 keV Ar+ ion bombarded as well as virgin Si surfaces with 

and without mass analyzer is shown in figure 6. The virgin Si surface contains Si, oxygen (O1s) 

and carbon (C1s). The presence of carbon and oxygen in Si is common 31. Oxygen comes from 

the native oxide layer if it is exposed to air and a trace amount of C remains during the Si wafer 

processing. We compare the XPS survey spectrum of virgin Si, and the Si bombarded with mass 

filtered and unfiltered 5 & 10 keV Ar ions. For mass filtered Ar+ ion bombardment, Ar peak is 

observed in addition to Si, C and O peaks. It shows that the surface contains the same elements 

9 

 
as virgin Si with additional Ar peak. But, in the case of unanalyzed Ar bombardment, a new N 

peak,  as  well  as  the  increased  intensity  of  C  and  O,  is  found.  It  proves  the  presence  of 

contamination in mass unanalyzed ion-bombarded Si surface.

To  identify  and  quantify  the  presence  of  contamination  in  the  unfiltered  beam,  we 

recorded the mass spectrum of the ion beam extracted at 10 keV by the same analyzing magnet. 

Although the ion source was filled with pure Ar gas, we find other common species in the form 

of ions. The mass spectrum for 10 keV beam is shown in figure 7. The spectrum shows H, N, O 

and C ions along with the Ar ion. So, the unanalyzed Ar ion beam that bombarded the Si surface 

is a mixture of Ar, O, N, C and H ions. Therefore, all of these ions bombard the Si surface when 

the  beam  is  not  filtered  by  the  analyzing  magnet.  This  type  of  beam  contamination  is  very 

common for almost all type of ion sources  44-46. It is found that the mass spectra are consistent 

with the XPS survey data considering the sensitivity factor of the respective elements (figure 6b). 

The  contaminations  in  the  Ar+  beam  specifically  C,  O,  N  like  reactive  species  change  the 

chemical  nature  of  the  surface  which  generates  additional  surface  instability  during  ion 

bombardment.

The  change  of  surface  chemistry  due  to  contaminated  Ar+  ion  bombardment  is  further 

investigated in details by high-resolution XPS measurements. Figure 8 (a) and (b) show the Si 2p 

core level spectra of Si surfaces bombarded with unfiltered Ar+ ion (5 & 10 keV). The Si 2p peak 

can be fitted by four p-type Gauss-Lorentz peaks (2p3/2 + 2p1/2) which contain elemental Si (B.E. 

= 99.2 ± 0.15 eV ), SiC (B.E = 100 ± 0.1 eV), Si3N4 (B.E. = 101.4 ± 0.2 eV) and SiO2 (B.E. = 

103 ± 0.2 eV). Also, the % area of unreacted Si and its compound are calculated from figure 8 

(a) & (b) which are shown in table 1.

As  C  is  present  in  all  the  samples,  we  have  taken  high-resolution  spectra  for  C  1s  for 

virgin,  and  Ar  bombarded  Si  surfaces.  It  is  found  that  C  beam  plays  a  different  role  when 

implanted in Si compared to the carbon commonly present in Si as contamination. Figure 9 (a) 

and (b) show the core level C 1s spectra of virgin Si and 10 keV mass selected Ar bombarded Si 

surfaces.  No  chemical  change  of  as  presented  C  in  Si  is  observed  here.  However,  C  1s  high-

resolution spectrum from Si surface bombarded with unanalyzed  contaminated (contains C ion 

also)  beam  shows  chemical  alteration  of  C  1s  spectra.  The    spectrum  shown  in  figure  9  (c)  is 

fitted by three peaks,  at  282.88 eV,  284.7 eV and  286.5 eV corresponding to silicon carbide 

(SiC), elemental C and hydroxyl (C-OH) respectively. The peak at 282.88 eV confirms again the 

SiC formation by C+ impurity ions present in the mass unanalyzed ion beam. . The formation of 

Si3N4  and  SiC  during  N  and  C  ion  bombardment  to  Si  surface  was  also  previously  observed 

19,39,47. The table 2 shows the binding energies (B.E) of Si, SiC, Si3N4 and SiO2 reported earlier 

and measured in the present study. The hump at 286.5 eV is due to  hydroxyl adsoption which 

was also  observed previously around this binding energy 48,49. Similar hydroxyl (C-OH) hump is 

also present at slight higher binding energy for virgin and 10 keV mass analyzed Ar bombarded 

Si surfaces as shown in figure 9 (a) and (b). The high-resolution Ar 2p core-level spectrum for 5 

keV mass unanalyzed Si surface is also shown in figure 9 (d) which displays the fine splitting of 

Ar 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 with binding energy separation  2.1 eV. It again shows inertness with Si as is 

observed before for Si surface bombarded with mass selected Ar ions (fig. 4a).

The absence of well-defined pattern by mass selected Ar+ beam indicates that when pure 

kinematics  induced  instabilities  are  not  sufficient,  reactive  contaminants  in  the  unanalyzed 

primary  beam  introduce  surface  chemical  inhomogeneity  to  generate  required  instability  for 

pattern formation. Researchers have tried to explain the ripple pattern formation on the basis of 

curvature  depended  coefficients  of  height  equation  considering  the  effect  of  sputtering,  mass 

redistribution  and  also  the  presence  of  implant  species  5,30,43,54-58.  But,  these  theoretical 

improvements could not able to explain the absence of ripple pattern formation on Si by Ar+ ion 

bombardment in ion energy (3-10 keV) 15-19 whereas it is easily observed in the lower energy (< 

3  keV)  with  Ar+  ion  beam  2,4-14.  Although  Hofsass  30  explained  theoretically  the  absence  of 

pattern  formation,  but  still  now  no  such  experimental  explanation  has  been  reported.  We  have 

shown here that the presence of implant species and specifically the reaction of reactive implants 

with  Si  and  consequent  alteration  of  sputtering  and  mass  redistribution  of  the  chemically 

inhomogeneous surface might explain the paradox.  

The height equation for ion sputtered surface is written as 59

    ,      i = 1, 2.     

Hofsaas et al. 30 calculated the C11

tot,  considering the curvature dependent sputtering      

      , 

mass  redistribution     

    ,    presence  of  in-active  implanted  species       

      and  one  more 

stabilizing  term (D11  redistribution).  But the value of  C11

tot  is  still slightly negative  except 2-4 keV 

ion  energy  which  indicates  the  slow  growth  rate  of  parallel  ripple  pattern.  The  observed 

negligible negative value of C11

tot for energy 1.3 to 10 keV predicts no ripple formation in typical 

fluence up to 1018 ions/ cm2. They also reported no well-defined ripple pattern for 3-10 keV mass 

selected Ar+ ion beam. However, they found negative value of C11

tot for energy less than 1.3 keV 

and  experimentally  observed  ripple  pattern  when  the  experiments  were  performed  by  an 

unanalyzed Ar beam from a microwave plasma ion source.  

 The pure mass selected Ar+ ions could not generate instability in the low energy regime 

whereas in the unanalyzed beam, the presence of contaminations changes the surface chemistry 

by  reacting  with  Si  atoms.  The  in-equal  sputtering  yield  of  pure  Si  and  compound  Si  generate 

additional instability. Similarly, ion-induced mass redistribution is also altered and increases the 

surface  instability.  It  was  observed  that  the  Si3N4  compound  formed  during  12  keV  N+ 

bombardments on Si and unequal sputtering of Si3N4 and Si generated the surface instability  39. 

We recently have reported the ripple pattern formation due to preferential sputtering of different 

elements present on multi-elemental mica by 12 keV mass analyzed Ar bombardment 60. But, for 

Si like mono-elemental surface, low energy noble ions could not generate sufficient instability to 

form a pattern. Hence only a flat surface with very low roughness is formed even after long time 

bombardment.  It  was  previously  reported  that  reactive  O  or  C  or  N  ion  bombardment  could 

generate  instability  on  Si  surface  for  ripple  pattern  formation18,19,39,61-64.  That  instability  comes

from reactive ion induced chemical compound formation with Si. But Ar being inert could not 

form any  chemical compound with  Si upto  20 keV ion  bombardments.  The ion  beam used  for 

very low energy (~ 500 eV) Ar bombardment is generally mass unanalyzed. Therefore, observed 

ripple  pattern  on  Si  surface  may  be  due  to  the  additional  instability  originated  from  the  beam 

impurities. It was observed the SiC formation by 1-2 keV mass unanalyzed ion bombardment 31. 

So, the chemical nature of the surface patterns formed by low energy ion beam must be studied 

for  the  conclusion.  The  present  study  on  the  effect  of  pure  and  contaminated  Ar+  ion  beam 

bombardment on Si establishes the fact that the Ar+ ion beam (up to 10 keV) induced Si pattern 

formation is mainly due to the reactive contaminations. On the other way, we can conclude that 

low  energy  ion  bombardment  could  generate  pattern  formation  on  Si  only  when  the  chemical 

phase of Si is changed like the case of N,O and C ion bombardment. 

Conclusion 

In  summary,  we  have  experimentally  observed  the  mass  analyzed  and  without  mass 

analyzed  Ar+  ion  beam  induced  pattern  formation  on  Si.  For  the  mass  analyzed  ion 

bombardment, no chemical change of the Si surface is taken place and a flat surface is formed 

whereas, for the mass unanalyzed ion bombardment, surface chemistry is significantly changed 

and  the  well  periodic  ripple  pattern  is  observed  on  the  Si  surface.  This  experimental 

understanding  establishes  the  fact  that  the  presence  of  contaminations  with  ion  beam  play  the 

major role in the low energy Ar+ ion induced ripple pattern formation on Si. Our results will give 

a  boost  to  study  the  beam  purity  and  the  surface  chemistry  of  the  patterns  formed  by  mass 

unanalyzed  ion  beam.  It  will  also  stimulate  to  improve  the  theoretical  understanding  by 

incorporating  the  chemical  effect  in  the  continuum  model  of  low  energy  ion  beam  induced 

surface pattern formation.
