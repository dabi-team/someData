ABSTRACT

We analyse the coronal elemental abundances during a small ﬂare using Hinode/EIS observations.
Compared to the pre-ﬂare elemental abundances, we observed a strong increase in coronal abundance
of Ca XIV 193.84 Å, an emission line with low ﬁrst ionisation potential (FIP < 10 eV), as quantiﬁed by
the ratio Ca/Ar during the ﬂare. This is in contrast to the unchanged abundance ratio observed using
Si X 258.38 Å/S X 264.23 Å. We propose two diﬀerent mechanisms to explain the diﬀerent composition
results. Firstly, the small ﬂare-induced heating could have ionised S, but not the noble gas Ar, so that
the ﬂare-driven Alfvén waves brought up Si, S and Ca in tandem via the ponderomotive force which
acts on ions. Secondly, the location of the ﬂare in strong magnetic ﬁelds between two sunspots may
suggest fractionation occurred in the low chromosphere, where the background gas is neutral H. In
this region, high-FIP S could behave more like a low-FIP than a high-FIP element. The physical
interpretations proposed generate new insights into the evolution of plasma abundances in the solar
atmosphere during ﬂaring, and suggests that current models must be updated to reﬂect dynamic rather
than just static scenarios.

Keywords: Sun: abundances - Sun: corona - Sun: magnetic ﬁelds

1. INTRODUCTION

Composition of plasma in the solar corona is a tracer
of the ﬂow of plasma and energy from the solar interior.
Diﬀerent complex processes such as the propagation and
absorption of waves, convection of hot plasma and re-
connection and reconﬁguration of magnetic ﬁelds can
aﬀect the ﬂow and composition of plasma. This pro-
duces a clear and observable variation in the elemental
abundances of coronal plasma across diﬀerent regions of
the solar atmosphere (e.g., Brooks et al. 2015).

In order to parameterise and study the coronal ele-
mental abundances, we use the ﬁrst ionisation poten-
tial (FIP) bias, deﬁned as taking the ratio of an ele-
ment’s coronal to photospheric abundance with respect
to H. The FIP bias varies from solar structure to solar
structure, and is closely linked to the Sun’s magnetic
ﬁeld on all scales. Observed changes in elemental abun-

dances take place on time scales of years (solar cycle),
days or hours (magnetic ﬂux emergence and decay), or
minutes (ﬂare) (Brooks et al. 2017; Baker et al. 2018;
Warren 2014).
In a quintessential active region, low-
FIP elements (FIP < 10 eV) such as Ca, Mg and Si
exhibit enhanced abundances, while high-FIP elements
(FIP ≥ 10 eV) such as Ar, O and S retain their pho-
tospheric abundances. This elemental fractionation is
known as the FIP eﬀect. The FIP bias of the photo-
sphere is typically measured to be 1, with higher FIP
bias values of 3-4 found in the closed loops of a devel-
oped active region (cf. Del Zanna & Mason 2014; Baker
et al. 2013, 2015, 2018). The FIP bias value of quiet-
Sun (Warren 1999; Baker et al. 2013; Ko et al. 2016)
and coronal hole regions (Feldman et al. 1998; Brooks
& Warren 2011; Baker et al. 2013) has been explored
extensively, and has also been used to link solar wind

back to its source regions (Gloeckler & Geiss 1989; Fu
et al. 2017)

In addition to the small magnetic perturbations that
are common in a typical active region, rapid changes in
magnetic connectivity can also contribute to a change
in coronal composition. One of the events that causes
rapid coronal composition changes is a solar ﬂare. Solar
ﬂares are spectacular results of solar magnetic recon-
nection, characterised by the sudden release of energy
and plasma. This rapid change of magnetic conﬁgura-
tion triggers waves and energy that propagate into the
chromosphere (Fletcher & Hudson 2008), followed by
the ablation of plasma into the corona (Warren 2014).
This produces the variability in coronal emission intensi-
ties observed by spectrometers. The standard and static
coronal composition picture relies on a selective mecha-
nism, generating a coronal composition that is diﬀerent
from the photospheric one. On the other hand, abla-
tion does not act on speciﬁc elements. Warren (2014)
studied 21 M and X class ﬂares using Solar Dynamic
Observatory/EUV Variability Experiment (SDO/EVE)
showed that ablation acted on all elements and turned
the Sun-as-a-star coronal elemental abundances tem-
porarily closer to photospheric, in agreement with earlier
results of Veck & Parkinson (1981); Feldman & Wid-
ing (1990); McKenzie & Feldman (1992) and Del Zanna
& Woods (2013). However, an explanation that only
comprises of ablation falls short on addressing some
observations that obtained an enhanced low-FIP ele-
mental abundances (e.g. Doschek et al. 1985; Sterling
et al. 1993; Bentley et al. 1997; Fludra & Schmelz 1999;
Phillips et al. 2010; Phillips & Dennis 2012; Dennis et al.
2015; Sylwester et al. 2015), as well as the more recent
observations that have found evidence of an inverse FIP
(IFIP) eﬀect during the decay phase of ﬂares occurring
in very complex active regions. In such cases, the IFIP
signatures were observed with timescales of around 30
minutes (Doschek et al. 2015a; Doschek & Warren 2016;
Baker et al. 2019, 2020).

So far, the only theoretical model that is able to ex-
plain both the FIP and IFIP eﬀects is the ponderomotive
force fractionation model, proposed by Laming (2004,
2009, 2011, 2015). In this model, FIP eﬀect fractiona-
tion is caused by the reﬂection and refraction of Alfvén
waves in the upper chromosphere, especially in regions
with high density gradients. The change in wave di-
rection exerts a back reaction on the plasma ions, the
ponderomotive force, and depending on the origin and
nature of the waves this can vary in magnitude and
sign. The direction of the ponderomotive force leads
to ions that are guided in diﬀerent directions, causing
the FIP/IFIP eﬀect.

In this paper, we present Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet
Imaging Spectrometer (Hinode/EIS) observations taken
during a solar ﬂare which originated in a reconnecting
X-shaped structure rooted in a complex active region.
EIS catching the ﬂare in action provides an insight into
the rapid evolution of solar coronal composition. The
observations are presented in Section 2, with results and
discussion in Section 3 and Section 4. Conclusions are
then discussed in Section 5.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

AR 11967 was an old and complex active region with a
rich history. It was visible on the Southern hemisphere
of the Sun from 31 January 2014 to 7 February 2014.
The active region was in its second rotation on disk,
and major ﬂux emergence and reconnection could be ob-
served during this rotation. Figure 1 shows the magnetic
complexity of AR 11967 from the Solar Dynamics Obser-
vatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI;
Hoeksema et al. 2014) line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld data.
Its complex and active nature led to numerous eruptions,
resulting in 28 M-class ﬂares and 83 C-class ﬂares.

AR 11967 was particularly interesting as it hosted a
very stable, long lived X-shaped structure (previously
identiﬁed and discussed by Jiang et al. 2017; Kawabata
et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2016; Xue et al. 2017; Yang et al.
2017). This structure was observed from 2-5 Feb 2014,
and was located between the sunspots S1 and S3 shown
in the HMI magnetogram of Figure 1.

2.1. Coronal EUV and Magnetic Field Observations

The active region could be identiﬁed and studied on
its evolution across the disk using the full-disk Extreme-
Ultraviolet (EUV) and line of sight magnetogram images
from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen
et al. 2012) and the HMI instruments on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) space-
craft. Three diﬀerent passbands from AIA were used in
this analysis; 94 Å, 193 Å and 131 Å. Images from the
193 Å passband are especially useful for FIP bias anal-
ysis as they capture emission from elements at around
the same temperatures as one of the FIP bias pairs, Si X
(258.38 Å) and S X (264.23 Å), formed at ∼1.25-1.5 MK.
In contrast, 131 Å images are used as context images,
as this passband beneﬁts from clear ﬂaring illumination,
while 94 Å images were used to create the averaged in-
tensity light curve. The HMI line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld
images were used to demonstrate the magnetic evolu-
tion and ﬂux emergence of the active region. Both the
AIA and HMI data were processed using the standard
aia_prep.pro routine within SolarSoftWare (Freeland &
Handy 1998). This accounts for the diﬀerences in the

rectly aligns the two instruments. Both 193 Å and 131 Å
broadband images were also sharpened using the Multi-
scale Gaussian Normalisation technique (MGN; Morgan
& Druckmüller 2014).

2.2. EUV Spectroscopic Observations

The elemental abundance results discussed here
were derived using spectroscopic observations from
the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS;
Culhane et al. 2007) onboard the Hinode space-
Hinode/EIS observed
craft (Kosugi et al. 2007).

HPW021_VEL_240x512v1 and Atlas_30 (Study num-
ber 437 and 403 respectively). Table 1 shows the key
details of the studies that were used to track the evolu-
tion of AR 11967. Study 437 has a large ﬁeld of view
of 240(cid:48)(cid:48) × 520(cid:48)(cid:48).
It uses the slit scanning mode with
the 1(cid:48)(cid:48) slit and 1(cid:48)(cid:48) scan step size, with a long exposure
time of 60 s at each step for a total rastering time of
2 hours.
In contrast, study 403 is a full CCD study,
which has a smaller ﬁeld of view of 120(cid:48)(cid:48) × 160(cid:48)(cid:48), using
a 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slit with a 2(cid:48)(cid:48) step. At each pointing position, EIS
exposed for 30 s to produce a raster with a duration
of 30 minutes. Similar to the SDO data, the EIS data
were preprocessed using the standard eis_prep.pro rou-
tine available in SolarSoftWare; this accounts for dark
current, CCD bias, cosmic rays, hot, warm, dusty pixels,
the radiometric calibration, and orbital correction. The
eis_ccd_oﬀset.pro routine was then used to ensure spa-
tial consistency between diﬀerent EIS spectral windows.
The two pairs of low-FIP/high-FIP elements presented
here are close in wavelength, however the Fe lines used
for Diﬀerential Emission Measure (DEM) span both EIS
CCDs, so the Del Zanna (2013) Hinode/EIS calibration
was used to calibrate the EIS data.
In order to min-
imise the oﬀset between Hinode/EIS and SDO, the in-
tensity map of Fe XII 195.12 Å was aligned by-eye using
the AIA 193 Å passband. Since EIS Fe XII 195.12 Å
and AIA 193 Å sample plasma from similar tempera-
tures, the same solar structures could be identiﬁed in
both maps, making instrumental alignment easier and
more accurate.

2.3. Composition Maps

In our FIP bias examination, two pairs of emis-
sion lines, Si X 258.38 Å/S X 264.23 Å and Ca XIV
193.87 Å/Ar XIV 194.40 Å, were used extensively to ex-
amine composition measurements at two diﬀerent solar
atmospheric temperatures. Both pairs of elements are
comprised of one low-FIP element, Si (Ca) and a high-
FIP element, S (Ar).

2.3.1. Si X/S X Composition Map

The Si X (258.38 Å, FIP = 8.15 eV) and S X (264.23 Å,
FIP = 10.36 eV) line pair has a comparably lower for-
mation temperature at around 1.25-1.5 MK. The emis-
sion from the consecutive ionisation stages of Fe VIII–
Fe XVI were ﬁtted with a single Gaussian function, with
the exception of Fe XI, Fe XII and Fe XIII ﬁtted with
multiple Gaussians to obtain their intensities. The ef-
fects of density variation were estimated using the ﬁtted
Fe XIII 202.04 Å/203.83 Å line-pair ratio. These inten-
sities were then used to derive the Diﬀerential Emission
Measure (DEM) so that we can account for tempera-
ture eﬀects when modelling the S X line intensity. Since

the Fe lines lie on the short-wavelength detector and the
Si and S lines lie on the long-wavelength detector, the
emission measure was scaled to reproduce the intensity
of Si X 258.38 Å. The CHIANTI Atomic Database, Ver-
sion 8.0 (Dere et al. 1997; Del Zanna et al. 2015) was
used to obtain the contribution functions, applying the
photospheric abundances of Grevesse et al. (2007) for
all the spectral lines, while assuming the Fe XIII den-
sity calculated above. Lastly, both Si X 258.38 Å and
S X 264.23 Å, which form our FIP bias ratio were ﬁt-
ted with a single Gaussian function. The Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm from the PINTofALE
software package was used to compute the emission mea-
sure distribution for the Fe lines (Kashyap & Drake
2000). The emission measure distribution was then con-
volved with the CHIANTI contribution functions and
ﬁtted to the observed spectral intensity of the low-FIP
Fe emission lines. Since both Fe and Si are low-FIP
elements, the best ﬁt emission measure for each pixel
will be enhanced by some factor due to the FIP eﬀect.
We can determine this factor by calculating the inten-
sity of the S X 264.23 Å line; assuming S is a high-FIP
element that is not enhanced. Finally, the Si/S FIP
bias ratio presented in this paper is then the ratio of
the predicted to observed intensity of the S X 264.23 Å
line. In total, 17 spectral lines were used to infer our
Si X 258.38 Å/S X 264.23 Å composition maps. Data
pixels with a ¯χ2 > 17 were discarded during our analy-
sis. Since EIS is formed by both a short-wavelength and
long-wavelength detectors with an oﬀset of 18.5 pixels
in the y direction, part of our region of interest that lies
at the top of the long-wavelength detector was not cap-
tured by the short wavelength detector. The lack of data
for the Si X 258.38 Å/S X 264.23 Å composition calcula-
tion contributed to a horizontal strip of data with very
high ¯χ2 value, and this resulted in the patch of missing
data shown in Figure 3. The estimated uncertainty of
the Si X 258.38 Å/S X 264.23 Å FIP bias ratio is 0.30,
assuming a 20% spectral line intensity error. This ap-
proach is discussed in detail by Brooks et al. (2015), and
is designed to remove the temperature and density ef-
fects for a robust calculation of the FIP bias in diﬀerent
solar features.

2.3.2. Ca XIV/Ar XIV Composition Map

The Ca XIV (193.87 Å, FIP = 6.11 eV) and Ar XIV
(194.40 Å, FIP = 15.76 eV) emission lines are formed
at a comparably higher ionisation equilibrium tempera-
ture of around 3.5 MK (log10T = 6.55) (Feldman et al.
2009). Both lines are relatively strong and present simi-
lar emissivity temperature dependence. Three Gaussian
functions were ﬁtted to both the Ca XIV 193.87 Å and

Ar XIV 194.40 Å lines, as Ca XIV 193.87 Å is sand-
wiched between two other lines, and sometimes Ar XIV
is blended with two very faint lines along its blue wing
(Brown et al. 2008). In this paper, we follow the analy-
sis done by Doschek et al. (2015b); Doschek & Warren
(2016, 2017); Baker et al. (2019, 2020) in producing the
composition maps.
In particular, Doschek & Warren
(2017) describes the assumptions and issues that come
with this composition diagnostic. We used log10 abun-
dance values relative to log10H as; coronal-Ca = 6.93
(Feldman 1992), photospheric-Ca = 6.33 (Lodders et al.
2009) and coronal and photospheric-Ar = 6.50 (Lodders
et al. 2009). Since the spectral intensity of Ar at the
photosphere could not be directly measured, its abun-
dances value (photospheric-Ar) is determined indirectly
through spectra observed in solar wind, solar ﬂares or so-
lar energetic particles. As a result, historically, there has
been a relatively large ﬂuctuation of the photospheric-
Ar abundances. Figure 2 shows a plot of the ratio of
Ca XIV 193.87 Å to Ar XIV 194.40 Å contribution func-
tions at various densities using the abundances above.
This yields a typical coronal active region FIP bias of 4
and has the advantage of being quick and simple. How-
ever, taking ratio between the low FIP Ca XIV 193.87 Å
to the high FIP Ar XIV 194.40 Å does not account the
eﬀects of temperature and density. To alleviate the con-
cerns over the ratio value being sensitive to these ef-
fects, temperatures were calculated using ratio between
Ca XV 200.97 Å and Ca XIV 193.87 Å around the re-
gion of interest; its temperature histogram is also shown
in Figure 2. The Ca/Ar composition maps observed
before and during the ﬂare are similar in temperature
at ∼ log10T = 6.65K. The range of electron tempera-
tures during the ﬂare was also narrow, and ranges be-
tween log106.59 − log106.68. When these two pieces of
evidence are put side by side with the signiﬁcant inten-
sity ratio changes observed across the Ca/Ar maps, the
temperature and density can be seen to have a mini-
mal eﬀect for our analysis. The contribution functions
that are convolved with the DEM at the ﬂaring region
is shown in the Appendix.

2.4. Region Deﬁnition

In Figure 3, we can observe a signiﬁcant increase
in the Ca/Ar intensity ratio value in our third raster
(panel f) corresponding to the stable structure, which
clearly describes its X shaped morphology. Since this
X-shaped structure is extremely stable throughout the
period studied here on 2 Feb 2014, we deﬁned the ﬂaring
region using pixels with an intensity ratio value >3 in
this raster. This intensity ratio value represents an en-
hanced FIP bias. The pixels corresponding to this region

the two previous rasters on 2 Feb 2014, at 10:25 UT and

shows the extent of this region of interest diﬀerentially

there is good agreement, indicating the stability of the

used to deﬁne the region of interest.

3. RESULTS

Although the active region was observed by EIS be-
tween 1 and 5 Feb 2014, and the X-shaped structure
was apparent between 2 and 4 Feb, here we focus on
its evolution between 9:30 UT and 14:50 UT on 2 Feb.
The bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the averaged in-
tensity in the 94 Å passband in the ﬁeld of view shown
by the white box in Figure 1a. Multiple brightenings
can be identiﬁed, with the 3 blue horizontal lines in-

as shown by the small peak in Figure 3. It started at
13:22 UT, after our ﬁrst two rasters and around 1 hour
before the start time of our third raster. It peaked at
13:29 UT and decayed into background intensity levels
by ∼13:53 UT. Finally, the third ﬂare took place during

at 14:27 UT, approximately 9 minutes into the raster,
peaked at 14:37 UT and decayed to background inten-
sity level by ∼14:56 UT. Neither ﬂare 2 or 3 could be
identiﬁed in the GOES X-ray ﬂux, indicating that they
were very minor ﬂares.

3.1. Magnetic Field Evolution

AR 11967 was a highly complex AR built up by at
least three major bipoles in various stages of their evolu-
tion. Figure 1 shows both S1 and S2, which were leading
(positive) polarity spots produced by two ﬂux emergence
episodes before the AR rotated onto the disk. We can
see that the negative S5 is located tightly below S1, but
in fact S1 and S2’s following (negative) polarities had
already dispersed by this time. Despite this, S1 was
still a large spot exceeding 100 MSH according to the
Debrecen Photoheliographic Data. A major ﬂux emer-
gence occurred in the AR during the EIS observation
period, with its principal spots being S4 (positive) and
S3 (negative) in Figure 1. The parallel strands of oppo-
site polarities in between S4 and S3 indicate that this
emerging bipole is strongly sheared. The magnetic po-
larity pattern (magnetic tongues, cf. Luoni et al. 2011)
is indicative of negative, left-handed twist. As S4 and
S3 are separating in the course of ﬂux emergence, the
negative polarity S3 is moving towards the positive po-
larity S1. As the ﬂare observed with EIS took place in
between spots S3 and S1 (cf. Figure 1), a forcing by their
persistent approach was creating strong ﬁeld gradients
in the proximity of the X-shaped structure (Jiang et al.
2017; Kawabata et al. 2017).

EIS rasters made on 2 Feb 2014. EIS made two raster
observations after the ﬁrst ﬂare, with the second ﬂare
occurring before, and the third ﬂare during, the third
EIS raster. It can be seen in the ﬁrst row of Figure 3
that, across the three observations, in a temperature
range ∼1.25-1.5 MK, the Si X/S X composition map
does not show drastic changes, and the map is generally
red/dark orange in colour, comparable to a composition
map of a quiet sun region or a small active region.

However, at a higher temperature (corresponding to
the Ca XIV/Ar XIV ratio maps), a signiﬁcant enhance-
ment in FIP bias can be observed during the third ﬂare.
For the ﬁrst two rasters, the region of the solar ﬂare
shows up as red in the intensity ratio map, indicating
an ordinary quiet sun FIP bias value of 2, similar to
the FIP bias value calculated using the Si X/S X com-
position map. However, a clear change in coronal abun-
dances can be seen in the third raster, where EIS ob-
serves the third ﬂare (as a yellow region, indicating en-
hanced FIP) which peaked at 14:29 UT. The shape of
the enhanced intensity ratio patch fully traces the topol-
ogy of the X-shaped ﬂare structure.

These changes in the maps are reﬂected in the data
histograms in Figure 4 taken around the ﬂaring re-
gion. The Si X/S X histogram shows little change be-
tween the three observations. On the other hand, the
Ca XIV/Ar XIV ratio value histogram shows a drastic
enhancement in the mean FIP bias value, which changes
from a quiet sun value of ∼2 to 3.77, which is well be-
yond the estimated error. The FIP bias value there-
fore exhibits a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between two diﬀer-
ent temperatures.

density eﬀects by utilising both the short-wavelength and long-wavelength detectors of Hinode/EIS. Oﬀset between the two
detectors contributed to the patch of dark pixels in the composition maps; The Ca XIV 193.87 Å/Ar XIV 194.40 Å ratio maps
are simply intensity ratio of the two spectral lines. A more detailed description can be found in Section 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.

AR 11967 observed by Hinode/EIS on 2 Feb 2014. This
opened up a possibility of obtaining composition during
a solar ﬂare. Over the course of the three observations,
a low FIP bias value of ∼2 can be seen across all of
the Si/S composition maps. Although the higher tem-
perature Ca/Ar composition map shows comparable be-
haviour for the ﬁrst two rasters, it shows a signiﬁcantly
enhanced ratio value for the third raster in both the
composition map and the ratio value histogram in Fig-
ure 4, indicating a strong FIP eﬀect during the ﬂare.
This inconsistent behaviour between composition maps
formed using two line pairs is very interesting as it is dif-
ferent from the photospheric composition in ﬂares found
by Warren (2014); Baker et al. (2019), which is typically
interpreted as an enhancement of photospheric material
in the corona due to chromospheric ablation as part of
the ﬂare process.

4.1. Physical Interpretation

We suggest two possible scenarios that could help to
explain the evolution of the composition, in addition to
the ablation picture we expect after ﬂares. First, the
fact that S as a high-FIP element has a relatively low
FIP value which is close to 10 eV. Secondly, the potential

shift of elemental fractionation height due to the strong
magnetic ﬁelds observed here.

The model to explain the observed fractionation of el-
emental abundances in the solar atmosphere is a quasi-
static model of long-lasting structures such as coronal
loops, active regions and solar wind outﬂow regions (cf.
Laming 2004; Laming et al. 2019). Under these static
scenarios, in closed loops, the fractionation occurs at
the top of the chromosphere. Warren (2014) studied the
evolution of plasma composition in large ﬂares which in-
volves a dynamic rapid evolution of plasma parameters
(highly time dependent), and suggested that in some
dramatic time-dependent events like large M and X class
ﬂares, the observed elemental abundance variation was
due to plasma ablated from deep in the chromosphere,
below where fractionation occurs. However, this is not
the case here, where an enhanced abundance of Ca, or
in other studies, where an enhancement of other various
low-FIP elements (e.g., Fludra & Schmelz 1999; Phillips
et al. 2010; Phillips & Dennis 2012; Dennis et al. 2015)
was observed. Therefore, we have to look for other mech-
anisms to ﬁnd an explanation.

4.1.1. Partial Ionisation of Diﬀerent Elements

Firstly, the diﬀerent composition evolution in the Si/S
and Ca/Ar line pairs could be due to the actual FIP

values of these elements. We have adopted the conven-
tion of categorising Si and Ca as low FIP elements and
S and Ar as high FIP elements. While S is typically
categorised as a high FIP element, it has a relatively
low FIP value of 10.36 eV, whereas Si, typically cate-
gorised as a low FIP element, has a comparable FIP
value of 8.15 eV. The diﬀerence between their FIP val-
ues is therefore merely 2.21 eV. In contrast, as Ar is a
noble gas, it has a much higher FIP of 15.76 eV, with
the result that the diﬀerence in FIP between it and Ca
(FIP = 6.11 eV) is 9.65 eV.

During a ﬂare, magnetic reconnection produces Alfvén
waves that travel from the corona to the chromosphere
(e.g. Fletcher & Hudson 2008). The refraction of such
waves at the top of the chromosphere can then create an
upward ponderomotive force that acts only on ions (cf.
Laming 2009). However, the same reconnection process
also accelerates and heats particles, which at their im-
pact onto the chromosphere lead to heating and conse-
quent ablation of plasma. For fractionation to occur, the
Alfvén speed must be greater than the electron thermal
speed, so that following coronal energy release, Alfvén
waves get to the chromosphere ﬁrst to cause fractiona-
tion before the heat conduction ﬂux arrives to cause the
evaporation. If this is violated, unfractionated plasma
will be evaporated into the ﬂare loops. However, if the
two speeds were about equal, fractionation with extra
ionisation of S would result. For the ﬂare studied here,
which was very small, the heating produced could have
been suﬃcient to ionise S with its relatively low FIP,
with the ponderomotive force bringing up both Si and S
in tandem, thus maintaining the quiet-sun FIP bias val-
ues that can be seen across the Si/S composition maps
and their respective data histograms. On the contrary,
due to the relatively high FIP of Ar, the small heating
associated with the observed small ﬂare was insuﬃcient
to ionise Ar. Instead, the more abundant low FIP Ca
ions were brought up by the ponderomotive force, thus
generating the fractionation observed in the third Ca/Ar
intensity ratio map.

Within the above interpretation, this observation
could open up a unique way to probe into the fraction-
ation height in the solar atmosphere by diﬀerent solar
phenomena. With the partial ionisation of S but not
Ar, one can estimate the upper chromospheric tempera-
ture at the time of the ﬂare. Using Laming et al. (2019),
the chromospheric model by Avrett & Loeser (2008) and
collisional ionisation equalibrium calculation from Maz-
zotta et al. (1998), the chromospheric temperature needs
to be

2.5 × 104K < T < 3.0 × 104K.

(1)

The true temperature is likely to be lower, because cal-
culations from Mazzotta et al. (1998) neglect photo-
ionisation and density eﬀects. Nonetheless, this pos-
tulate provides an additional insight into the work done
by Warren (2014) and Dennis et al. (2015), who stud-
ied the composition evolution in large ﬂares. For larger
ﬂares, more energy is released, which should produce a
correspondingly large increase in temperature, thus ion-
ising Ar. This would then produce suﬃcient ionised Ar
to experience the ponderomotive force, resulting in the
photospheric-like coronal composition more commonly
observed during ﬂares.

4.1.2. Fractionation in the Low Chromosphere

Another plausible scenario comes from the fact that
the ﬂare studied here took place between the strong
magnetic ﬁelds of two large sunspots. This has the eﬀect
of lowering the plasma β = 1 height and consequently
the fractionation height of the diﬀerent elements. As
identiﬁed in Fletcher & Hudson (2008), a solar ﬂare
which triggers reconﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld gen-
erates large-scale Alfvén waves which propagate from
the ﬂaring site to the lower chromosphere, where the
background gas is neutral H. In this region, high FIP
S behaves like a low FIP element (Laming et al. 2019);
behaviour consistent with the statistically insigniﬁcant
changes of Si/S FIP bias observed here. This requires a
relaxing of the quasi-static nature of FIP models, to al-
low fractionation to occur throughout the chromosphere
and not just at the top, which follows if the waves are in
resonance with the loop. As with the scenario involving
partial ionisation described above, this would result in
fractionation of Ca and both Si and S, producing the
constant Si/S and an increase in Ca/Ar observed here.
These observations are consistent with the ponderomo-
tive force interpretation for variation in FIP bias.

4.2. AIA Wavelet Analysis

Although the two physical interpretations both seem
plausible, they both rely on ﬂare-driven downward trav-
elling Alfvén waves which induce the ponderomotive
force acting upwards. To try and identify this essential
signature of Alfvén waves propagating to the chromo-
sphere, the AIA data in diﬀerent passbands were anal-
ysed using a wavelet technique similar to that previously
used by e.g., Milligan et al. (2017); Hayes et al. (2016).
The intensity in the HMI continuum, 1600 Å, 1700 Å,
304 Å, 131 Å and 94 Å passbands was averaged within
the region indicated by the white box shown in Figure 1.
The top left of Figure 5 shows the normalised wavelet
analysis of the wavelengths, with the top right panel
showing the detrended data produced by subtracting

a smoothed version of the data. This was then anal-
ysed using the wavelet technique of Torrence & Compo
(1998).
It can be seen in panels c–h of Figure 5 that
each of the diﬀerent passbands (with the exception of
the HMI continuum) exhibits a variation in the signal as-
sociated with the small-scale brightening discussed here.
However, the signals are in the form of a single peak in-
stead of an oscillation. Moreover, in terms of the signal
strength, apart from 304 Å, no other passbands show a
signiﬁcant intensity. It is also notable that most of the
observed signal for each passband is below the white tri-
angular lines, indicating that they are not statistically
signiﬁcant and outside the zone of inﬂuence.

This suggests that the Alfvén waves produced by the
ﬂare in the corona proposed by Fletcher & Hudson
(2008) could not be observed in the lower solar atmo-
sphere using the data available here. The lack of a sta-

tistically sound signal that could support wave propa-
gation is disappointing, but this result could still inform
several investigation directions for future work. Firstly,
the instrument, AIA, used in the analysis has a rela-
tively longer cadence of 12 s, which places a limit on
the frequency of the observable signal. Using an instru-
ment with a higher cadence, such as the Geostation-
ary Operational Environmental Satellite’s X-ray sensor
(GOES/XRS) could show the ﬁner scale oscillations, al-
beit without the spatial resolution required here. A
back of the envelope calculation gives insight into the
wavelet period we can look into in the future, using
a simple calculation from the coronal loop length and

our case, taking from the observations and assuming a
semi-circle coronal loop, the loop length can be esti-
mated to be ∼40(cid:48)(cid:48); and the x-shaped structure is rooted

in an intense magnetic ﬁeld with a line of sight ﬁeld
strength of ∼2,500 Gauss. Assuming a loop density
of ∼ 3 × 10−7 kgm−3 (Kohutova & Verwichte 2017),
this gives the line of sight Alfvén speed, vAz, to be
∼400 kms−1, and a resonant wave period of 140 seconds.
This value can then be compared with future wavelet
analysis and help pinpoint the Alfvén waves.

Secondly, AIA is a broadband imager, which captures
spectral lines across a wide range of ions. Although a
strong signal can be found in the 304 Å wavelet analysis,
which seems to suggest variations indeed exist in the
chromosphere, the contributing spectral lines could not
be precisely identiﬁed. The use of co-temporal narrow
band spectroscopic data could provide more insight into
the wave propagation depth, and perhaps open up the
possibility of correlating the oscillation strength with the
the observed FIP bias.

5. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented observations of the
highly complex active region, AR 11967, which have
provided a unique opportunity to study the evolution of
composition in a small ﬂare that occurred between two
large sunspots. On 2 Feb 2014, EIS observed a small
ﬂare within an X-shaped structure in the active region.
The results show very diﬀerent composition evolution
at two diﬀerent line pairs of diﬀerent formation tem-
peratures, with an unchanged composition obtained in
the lower temperature Si X/S X composition map in the
ﬂaring region, while a signiﬁcant FIP bias value increase
was observed in the higher temperature Ca XIV/Ar XIV
composition ratio.

We propose two possible physical

interpretations
which could explain or contribute to the strange com-
position evolution. Firstly, in the case of partial ionisa-
tion, due to the relatively low ﬁrst ionisation potential
of S, both Si and S were ionised by the small third ﬂare
with relatively low chromospheric heating, leaving the
Si X/S X FIP bias value unchanged. While the lower
FIP of S meant that it could be ionised by the small
ﬂare observed here, the much higher FIP value of Ar
meant that it could not be easily ionised. The resulting
ponderomotive force produced by the waves originat-
ing from magnetic reconnection leading to the ﬂare thus
only brought up the ionised Ca, Si and S in tandem.
A similar yet non-mutually exclusive mechanism could
be present in our second interpretation, fractionation
at the lower chromosphere. Our ﬂare occurred between
two sunspots, rooted in a region of strong magnetic ﬁeld.
This has the eﬀect of lowering the regions of fractiona-
tion of the diﬀerent elements. Alfvén waves generated
by the ﬂare travelled to the lower chromosphere, where

11

the background gas is neutral H. Under this condition, S
behaves like a low-FIP element. Therefore both Si and
S fractionate in this ﬂare and the Si/S ratio does not
change, while the high-FIP Ar does not change its be-
haviour. This creates a signiﬁcant discrepancy that can
be observed between the two sets of composition maps.
Both interpretations of the evolution of composition dur-
ing a small ﬂare that we present here are consistent with
the ponderomotive force interpretation for variation in
FIP bias.

Since these two interpretations involve Alfvén waves
that travel to the chromosphere, a wavelet analysis ap-
proach applied to the co-temporal AIA data was used
to search for wave signatures. However, waves in the
lower chromosphere during the reconnection were not
detected with this method. Nonetheless, this provides
the further investigation direction at correlating elemen-
tal fractionation with wave oscillations. Firstly, the rel-
atively long cadence of AIA (12 s) limits the observation
of very high frequency signals. Secondly, AIA/SDO is
a broad band imager. Signals obtained from diﬀerent
passbands merely give a very arbitrary idea of of the so-
lar altitude. The use of co-temporal narrow band spec-
trometer will give more insight of the wave propagation
depth, and perhaps open up the possibility of correlat-
ing the oscillation strength with the observed FIP bias.
Some of the work to combine observations between dif-
ferent layers of the solar atmosphere has been done in
Baker et al. (2021), using the Interferometric BIdimen-
sional Spectrometer (IBIS), EIS and magnetic ﬁeld mod-
elling. Ground-based instruments like IBIS and Daniel
K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will be extremely
valuable in the future, by directly observing where the
wave refraction and reﬂections are proposed to happen.
The upcoming Solar-C EUVST and its wide range of
temperature coverage can also contribute massively by
observing diﬀerent layers of our Sun’s atmosphere si-
multaneously. If the existence of Alfvén waves can be
conﬁrmed, this observation could be the another step
to understand the physical mechanism behind composi-
tion evolution during ﬂares, and current theories need
to factor the time evolution of composition into their
modelling.

6. APPENDIX

In this section, we address the concern of tempera-
ture eﬀect on the Ca XIV/Ar XIV intensity ratio value.
In Figure 2, the electron temperature at the ﬂaring re-
gion ranges from log106.59 − log106.68. This puts the
theoretical intensity ratio at the uphill region in panel
a of Figure 2, suggesting that a change in temperature
could produce the observed change in the intensity ratio.
