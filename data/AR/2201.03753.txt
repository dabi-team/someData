Abstract

The origin of the jet-like structures observed in Cassiopeia A is still unclear, although it seems
to be related to its explosion mechanism. X-ray observations of the characteristic structures
could provide us useful information on the explosive nucleosynthesis via the observation of
elements, which is a unique approach to understand its origin. We here report the discovery of
shocked stable Ti, which is produced only at the inner region of exploding stars, in the northeast
jet of Cassiopeia A using the 1-Ms deep observation with the Chandra X-ray observatory. The
observed Ti coexists with other intermediate-mass elements (e.g. Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe at the
tip of the X-ray jet structure. We found that its elemental composition is well explained with
the production by the incomplete Si burning regime, indicating that the formation process of
the jet structure was sub-energetic at the explosion (the peak temperature during the nuclear
burning must be <
∼ 5×109 K at most). Thus, we conclude that the energy source that formed
the jet structure was not the primary engine for the supernova explosion. Our results are useful
to limit the power of the jet-structure formation process, and a weak jet mechanism with low
temperature may be needed to explain it.

1 Introduction

Asymmetry is widely believed to play an important role in the
explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe).
Recent simulations of the neutrino-driven explosion that is a
currently viable mechanism (Bethe & Wilson 1985) have in-
dicated that the SN shock wave can be accelerated mainly by
convective hot bubbles produced by neutrino heating and stand-
ing accretion shock instability: SASI (Janka 2012; Burrows &
Vartanyan 2021). These effects could be related to the observed
asymmetric ejecta distributions and neutron-star kick directions

of CC remnants (Lopez et al. 2011; Holland-Ashford et al.
2017; Holland-Ashford et al. 2020; Katsuda et al. 2018). In ad-
dition to this mechanism, bipolar explosions that could originate
from the rotation of the progenitor star are also believed to be
an important asymmetric mechanism to explain SN/SNR obser-
vations (Khokhlov et al. 1999; Fryer & Heger 2000; Takiwaki
et al. 2009). In this case, extremely bimodal asymmetry on the
ejecta distribution is expected, which is a major feature of this
mechanism. To unveil the SN explosion mechanisms, it would
be useful to test these different asymmetric effects using obser-

The Galactic SNR Cassiopeia A (Cas A) provides us a
great opportunity to probe the asymmetric effects at the explo-
sion. For example, the high-velocity optical knots have clearly
shown the asymmetric explosion in Cas A (Fesen & Gunderson
1996; Fesen 2001; Fesen et al. 2006; Fesen & Milisavljevic
2016; Thorstensen et al. 2001). In particular, the S-rich opti-
cal knots in the NE jet and SW counterjet regions have high
velocities of > 10,000 km s−1, which is a unique feature con-
nected to the explosion mechanism. These jet-like structures
are kinematically and chemically distinct from the rest of the
remnant, which seems to be related to the explosion mecha-
nism. In addition, the bubble-like interior observed in Cas A
also indicates strong evidence of asymmetric mixing processes
during the explosion (Milisavljevic & Fesen 2015). Not only
these characteristic asymmetric structures, the observations of
some speciﬁc elements such as 44Ti, stable Ti and Cr synthe-
sized in the high-entropy nuclear burning regime also allow us
to test asymmetric activities at the heart of the SN explosion of
Cas A (Grefenstette et al. 2014; Grefenstette et al. 2017; Sato
et al. 2021). As above, the asymmetric explosion of the Cas A
supernova has been well discussed from various viewpoints and
its origin has been debated for years.

Recent theoretical and observational studies have supported
that the asymmetries by the neutrino-driven mechanism can
explain well the observational properties of Cas A (Hughes
et al. 2000; Grefenstette et al. 2014; Grefenstette et al. 2017;
Wongwathanarat et al. 2017; Orlando et al. 2021; Vance et al.
2020; Sato et al. 2021). On the other hand, the characteris-
tic jet-like structures cannot be explained by only this mecha-
nism, and its formation process is still an open question. Here,
we would note that the jet-like structures do not appear to have
been created by a bipolar explosion (in other words, the struc-
tures did not drive the explosion). In bipolar explosions, Fe-
rich materials that are produced by α-rich freezeout should be
ejected at high velocities along the jet axis (Maeda & Nomoto
2003; Tominaga 2009), however the existence of such Fe-rich
ejecta have not been reported in this region (Hwang et al. 2004).
One of candidates for the jet formation process would be some
post-explosion activities. Some previous studies have suggested
that an underenergetic jet from a rotating new-born neutron
star, which would have emerged after the supernova explosion,
might explain this feature (Burrows et al. 2005; Orlando et al.
2021). However, there is not ﬁrm observational evidence on it.

In order to understand its origin, we investigate the elemen-
tal composition in the northeastern jet structure in this paper.
If the structure was produced in the Si-burning regime around
the supernova engine (in other words, if it was related to the
inner asymmetries), we can discuss how deep into the super-
nova it was produced, by measuring its elemental composi-
tion (Woosley et al. 1973; Yamaguchi et al. 2017; Sato et al.

edge of the remnant is traced with the black curve. The black broken rectan-

2020; Sato et al. 2021; Ohshiro et al. 2021). For example, the
elemental composition enriched in the intermediate mass ele-
ments (e.g. Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe have already been suggested
to be of Si-burning origin (Hwang et al. 2004). However, a more
detailed investigation of the elements and comparison with nu-
cleosynthesis calculations are still necessary to clarify its ori-
gin. In this research, we focus on the search for Ti and other
Fe-group elements that can characterize that burning layer and
discuss the origin of the jet structure.

2 Observation and Image Analysis

2.1 Observation and Data Reduction

Cas A has been observed multiple times with Chandra X-ray
observatory since it was observed as ﬁrst light target of Chandra
in 2000 (Hwang et al. 2000; Hwang et al. 2004; Hughes et
al. 2000; Uchiyama & Aharonian 2008; Patnaude et al. 2011;
Patnaude & Fesen 2014; Sato et al. 2017; Sato et al. 2018).
The ejecta positions are shifting from observation to observa-
tion due to its expansion. Therefore, we used only the deep-
est observation in 2004 composed of separate 9 ObsIDs (4634,
4635, 4636, 4637, 4638, 4639, 5196, 5319, 5320) (Hwang et
al. 2004) to reduce the uncertainty on the region selection. The
data were reprocessed using CIAO 4.8 and Chandra CalDB ver-
sion 4.7.0 In general, the data quality depends on the condition
of individual observations because data sometimes suffer from
particle ﬂares in orbit which can not be removed by the standard
pipeline process. These particle ﬂares cause high background in
the detector, we exclude such intervals by using light curve in
off-source for each observation. Time periods where the count

rate deviates from the mean value during quiescent periods by
≥ 3σ are removed from subsequent analysis. These ﬁltered data
which range between ∼40 ks and ∼160 ks and total exposure of
them are ∼960 ks. All the spectra were extracted individually
for each of the nine observation segments, and corresponding
detector response ﬁles were generated. The individual spectra
were then added together to produce the ﬁnal spectrum for a par-
ticular region, while the individual response ﬁles were weighted
according to the relative exposure time of each observation seg-
ment before being added to produce the ﬁnal response ﬁles.

2.2 Distribution of Elements in the Northeast Jet

Cas A is observed as a complex mixture of thermal and non-
thermal X-ray radiations. Thus, we would need to perform de-
tailed image analysis to extract pure ejecta regions associated
with the jet from the observed data. The northeastern (NE) jet-
like structure of Cas A can be observed as a Si-rich feature in
X-rays (Figure 1), which is the brightest jet-like structure in the
remnant. Here we can see the Si-rich ﬁlaments in the northeast
region beyond the forward shock clearly. Although the counter
jet structure in the southwest has been also known, this study
focuses only on the NE jet. This is because that the strong non-
thermal radiation and weak thermal radiation in this region.

In order to clarify more detailed spatial distribution of ele-
ments in the NE jet region, we produced ratio maps between

K-shell line emissions and continuum emissions for each el-
ement (Figure 2). As a result, we found that the interme-
diate mass elements (Si, S, Ca, Ti) and Fe seem to coexist
along the jet structure, showing clumpy/ﬁlamentary distribu-
tion. Although the distribution of elements and the plasma
parameters around the jet region has been investigated well
(Hwang et al. 2004; Laming et al. 2006), our new maps provide
us the most detailed ones. In addition, we would emphasize that
the Ti map is for the ﬁrst time produced in this research. Strictly
speaking, there also exists emission lines from Ca in the energy
band for the Ti map (4.65–4.82 keV). On the other hand, the
difference from the Ca map implies a possibility that they have
different origins, supporting a real distribution of the shocked
Ti. To discuss its elemental composition accurately, we have
performed spectral analysis in following sections.

3 Spectral Analysis

3.1 Detection of Ti–Kα emissions

In the previous section, we found the Ti emissions seem to be
concentrated at the tips of the NE jet region. In theory, Ti should
be produced at the inner area of exploding stars (Thielemann et
al. 1996; Nakamura et al. 2001). Therefore, the jet may be re-
lated to the central activity at the explosion. On the other hand,
we would need a more careful investigation using spectroscopy

to verify the existence of Ti. Here, we show detail investigations
of the Ti emissions using spectral analysis.

Figure 3 shows the ACIS-S spectrum extracted from the NE
jet region (green region in Fig.2). As a result, we have found a
strong Ti-Kα line in the spectrum at a conﬁdence level greater
than 5σ. We here used two kinds of models to ﬁt the spec-
trum: (1) an absorbed single-component plane-parallel shock
model (vvpshock in XSPEC) and (2) a thermal bremsstrahlung
emission (bremss in XSPEC) with 10 Gaussian models. The
best-ﬁt parameters are summarized in Table 1. We found the
quality of the ﬁts improves greatly in both models by adding Ti
component (∆χ2 = 34, 40 in the vvpshock ﬁt and the bremss-
Gausssian ﬁt, respectively), indicating that the Ti-K detection is
5.3, 5.6σ level. Interestingly, the Ti abundance is signiﬁcantly
higher than the solar value, which would be useful to discuss
the origin of the jet structure (the detailed discussion is in the
Discussion section).

In the energy band around the Ti emissions, there also exists
some weak Ca lines (i.e. Ca Kβ and Kγ). We have carefully
evaluated these emissions in all our models and have concluded
that the handling of these weak lines does not change our con-
clusion. For example, the Doppler effect of these lines up to 10-
20 eV may explain 4.7 keV feature in the spectrum. However,
with such a large shift, the Ca He-like line should be also wider
(or distorted) than observed. In addition, the observed Ti line is
too strong to be explained with the other components. In fact,
there does not exist any strong lines except Ti-Kα emissions at

just between the Ca Kβ and Kγ emissions (see also Extended
Data Fig.2b in Sato et al. 2021).

We have also examined inﬂuence of pile-up events on the
spectrum. Actually, the pile-up effect can not ignore at some
bright spots in Cas A. In particular, strong line emissions such
as Si Heα and S Heα make fake line features at speciﬁc ener-
gies (e.g. Si Heα + Si Heα ≈ 3.7 keV, Si Heα + S Heα ≈ 4.3
keV). However, the 4.7 keV emissions exist only at the NE jet
region where the Si and S emissions are not so strong. In ad-
dition, there does not exist any combination of lines to explain
the 4.7 keV emissions. Moreover, the line centroid energy of
4.7 keV corresponds to the emissions from the He-like Ti ions,
which means the ionization state of the shocked Ti agrees well
with the other elements. From all these facts, we conclude that
the 4.7 keV emissions originate from the shocked Ti and our
measurement is robust.

3.2 Titanium Mass in the NE Jet

The total mass of the observed Ti would also provide us im-
portant information for discussing where the jet structure was
formed during the explosion. In order to estimate the mass of
the observed Ti in the NE jet, we here ﬁt the X-ray spectrum
with two non-equilibrium ionization plasma models (vvpshock
model in XSPEC; Borkowski et al. 2001) assuming the inter-
stellar absorption (wabs in XSPEC). In this analysis, we used
the entire jet region just outside forward shock (yellow region
of Figure 2).

We summarized the best-ﬁt abundances obtained from our
new ﬁtting in Table 2. Our model explained the spectrum well
(Fig.4; reduced χ2 < 2) and we found the plasma parameters of
kTcool ∼ 1.3 keV, kThot ∼ 9 keV, netcool ∼ 1.8×1011 s cm−3,
nethot ∼ 1.1×1011 s cm−3. We would note that the estima-
tion of the electron density and mass depends on the amount

of lighter elements that are difﬁcult to measure. Therefore, we
performed some spectral ﬁts assuming different abundances for
such a light element in this analysis. We here assumed a N-rich
plasma for both the hot and cool components because the opti-
cal knots dominated by [N II] along the NE jet were reported
from the HST observations (Hammell & Fesen 2008). We ﬁtted
the spectrum between 0.6 and 9 keV with varying the N abun-
dance from 100 to 12800 (solar ratio), and estimated its electron
density and Ti mass. The abundances of O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al,
Si, S, Ar, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe and Ni were tied between the hot and
cool components and ﬁtted as free parameters, while the rest of
the elemental abundances were ﬁxed at the solar values (Anders
& Grevesse 1989). In this way, we estimated upper and lower
bounds (90% level) of electron density and Ti mass.

The spectral ﬁtting provides the electron temperature kTe,

emission integral EI = (cid:82) nenH dV , ionization age I = (cid:82) nedt
and elemental abundances Z for two plasma components in the
jet of Cas A, where ne and nH are the densities of electron and
hydrogen, respectively. For measuring Ti mass, we calculate
the number of electrons per hydrogen atom Re = ne/nH and
the effective number of protons and neutrons (baryon mass) per
hydrogen atom Rm = nm/nH from the ﬁtting parameters (see
also Willingale et al. 2003), where nm is total number density of
protons+neutrons (including those bound up in nuclei). Here we
assume a fully ionised plasma. Thereafter, we can estimate the
electron density, hydrogen density, Ti mass (MTi), and thermal
pressure as following:
ne = (cid:112)EI Re/(V η)
nH = (cid:112)EI /(V ηRe)
MTi = mTiZTi
Pth = k(TiRi + TeRe)(cid:112)EI /(V ηRe)

(cid:112)EI ηV /Re

Here, mTi is the mass of Ti atom, V is the total plasma volume,
η is a ﬁlling factor within that volume and ZT i = nT i/nH is the
abundance of Ti. Assuming the distance of 3.4 kpc (Reed et al.
1995) and a cylinder volume with a 1(cid:48)(cid:48) diameter for expressing
the jet structure, the volume of the NE jet can be estimated to
be ∼1.5×1055 cm3 from the projected jet area (∼0.65 arcmin2).
To calculate the mass associated with the hot and cool compo-
nents, we must estimate the ﬁlling factors. We here assumed
pressure equilibrium between the hot and cool plasma, satisfy-
ing (TiRi/TeRe)hot = (TiRi/TeRe)cool, to give an estimate of
the ﬁlling factors within the overall jet. As we noted, the value
of electron density and mass have a large uncertainty from fully
ionized light nuclei. Laming et al. (2006) reported some of the
jet stem knots fall at lower temperatures than modeled assum-
ing O to be the most abundant element, which could be un-
derstood the jet knot plasma comprises a substantial fraction of
H. Therefore, we expected hydrogen occupy half of the mass of
the jet plasma (1/Rm < 0.5) as reasonable limits. Taking all this
into account, the ﬁlling factor for the components ηhot and ηcool
are assumed to be 0.94 and 0.06, respectively. As a result, the Ti
mass for the hot and cool component has been estimated to be in
the range of (0.30–1.7)×10−5 M(cid:12) and (0.14–0.73)×10−5 M(cid:12)
with 90% conﬁdence range, where the electron densities of each
component are 4.5–15 cm−3 and 0.6–2.2 cm−3, respectively.
Eventually, we obtained the total Ti mass is (0.44–2.4)×10−5
M(cid:12) as the sum of the hot and cool components.

4 Discussion

In this research, we for the ﬁrst time have detected the Ti-K line
from the NE jet structure of Cas A and estimated the total Ti
mass of (0.44–2.4)×10−5 M(cid:12). The detection of the rare ele-
ment that could have been produced by the high-entropy burn-
ing process is timely (Grefenstette et al. 2014; Sato et al. 2021),

and this new observation would help us to understand the origin
of the Cas A jet. In this section, we discuss the origin of Ti in
the jet region and how it is related to the explosion mechanism.

4.1 The Origin of the Titanium Emissions

If the observed Ti was surviving 44Ti before its decay, the jet
formation could be related to some strong central activity during
the explosion (Nagataki et al. 1998; Maeda & Nomoto 2003).
However, with just only the detection of the Ti line with X-
rays, we cannot conclude whether the observed Ti is radioac-
tive 44Ti or stable ones, since X-ray observations cannot distin-
guish among different isotopes. Here, the observations of 44Ti
from Cas A (Iyudin et al. 1994; Vink et al. 2001; Renaud et
al. 2006; Grefenstette et al. 2014) provide us useful informa-
tion to discuss it. The total amount of 44Ti in Cas A has been
estimated to be (1.25±0.3)×10−4 M(cid:12) from the NuSTAR obser-

vation (Grefenstette et al. 2014). Assuming the remnant age of
340 yrs and the half life of 60 yrs for 44Ti, the total 44Ti mass
at the present time is estimated to be ≈2.5×10−6 M(cid:12), which
is much smaller than the total mass of the shocked Ti we ob-
served. Furthermore, at least 80% of the observed 44Ti emission
is contained within the reverse shock radius as projected on the
plane of the sky (Grefenstette et al. 2014). Thus, the estimated
Ti mass in the NE jet (outside of reverse shock) is roughly an
order of magnitude larger than the expectation from the 44Ti
observation, suggesting the 44Ti is not the main source for the
observed Ti. Also, we estimated the 68 keV line ﬂux from 44Ti
in the NE region of Cas A using the NuSTAR archive data and
set the upper limit of 44Ti mass of ≈ 10−7 M(cid:12) in the NE jet,
which is much lower than that in the case that the observed Ti
originates from 44Ti purely. From the above, we conclude that
the observed Ti line in the NE jet does not come from 44Ti.

As the main source contributing to the Ti emissions in the
jet structure, we propose a stable Ti isotope, 48Ti (after de-
cay of 48Cr). Ti has ﬁve stable isotopes, of which 48Ti is the
most abundant, comprising around 90% of Ti in CC SN mod-
els (Sato et al. 2021). This stable Ti is produced by both in-
complete Si burning and α-rich freezeout (Thielemann et al.
1996; Nakamura et al. 2001; Sato et al. 2021). Therefore, the
synthesized amount of stable Ti does not purely reﬂect the prop-
erties of α-rich freezeout, which is different from the case of
44Ti. In the case of α-rich freezeout, the 44Ti and stable Ti are
synthesized with almost the same amount. This implies that
Ti produced by only α-rich freezeout would be difﬁcult to ex-
plain our jet observation, since a huge amount of 44Ti in the jet
(larger than the total 44Ti mass in the whole remnant) is needed
in this case. In addition, the elemental composition in the jet,
indicating Si-rich ejecta (Hwang et al. 2004; Hwang & Laming
2012; Vink 2004; Laming et al. 2006), is different from that

produced by α-rich freezeout. Thus, we propose a possibility
that the jet structure was produced by the incomplete Si burning
regime.

4.2 Constraint of the Burning Regime

Comparing the observed mass fractions with those of theoretical
calculations would be a straightforward approach to understand
the nucleosynthetic origin of the jet. In Table 2 and Fig. 5, we
summarize the observed mass ratios in the jet and their compar-
ison with theoretical calculations, supporting the incomplete-
Si-burning origin for the jet composition. In Fig. 5 (a), we ﬁnd
global consistency from Si to Ni between the observations and
the models in Thielemann et al. (1996). The initial mass of the
Cas A’s progenitor is inferred to be in the range of 15–25 M(cid:12)
(Chevalier & Oishi 2003; Young et al. 2006). Thus, we choose
the SN models in this range for the comparison. Here, we show
only the main products at the incomplete Si burning layer (28Si,
32S, 36Ar, 40Ca, 48Cr, 52Fe, 54+56Fe and 58Ni). The elements
synthesized efﬁciently in this layer such as Ar, Ca, Ti and Cr ﬁt
better with the models for the 15–20 M(cid:12) progenitors. On the
other hand, the models underestimate the mass ratios relative to
Ca in some elements (Si, S, Fe and Ni) that are efﬁciently pro-
duced at other layers. This implies that contributions from other
burning layers (e.g. explosive O burning, α-rich freezeout) to
the jet composition might be small. For further discussion, we
compare the observed Cr/Fe and Ar/Fe mass ratios with those
within the Si burning layers (Tpeak > 4.5 GK; Fig. 5 b). In the
Si burning layers, the mass fractions are characterized by only a
few physical parameters (e.g. Tpeak, ρpeak, Ye), which is useful
to determine the burning regime for the jet formation (Badenes
et al. 2008; Park et al. 2013; Yamaguchi et al. 2017; Sato et al.
2020; Sato et al. 2021). In particular, the synthesized amount of
the intermediate-mass α elements until Fe (such as 36Ar, 40Ca,
52Fe = 52Cr) are sensitive to the peak temperature during the
nuclear burning (Fig. 5 b). As a result, we ﬁnd that the ob-
served mass ratios agree well with those in the incomplete Si
burning (quasi statistical equilibrium: QSE) layer with the peak
temperature of ≈ 5 GK. All of these comparisons with theoreti-
cal calculations support that most of the ejecta in the NE jet had
been synthesized by the incomplete Si burning regime. This
picture also support the optical observations well (Milisavljevic
& Fesen 2013; Fesen & Milisavljevic 2016).

4.3 Jet Formation Mechanism

What is the actual mechanism that formed the jet structures in
Cas A? This would be still an open question. As already well
discussed in the previous studies (Grefenstette et al. 2014; Fesen
& Milisavljevic 2016), our results also do not support a jet-
driven explosion.
In the case of such explosions from some
strong central activities, iron-rich ejecta (i.e. α-rich freezeout

product) could be found along the jet structure or further ahead.
However, we can see only the Si-rich ejecta that seem to be
produced by the QSE layer. Currently, it would be difﬁcult to
explain the widely extended Si-rich (QSE) structure based on
our understandings of jet-driven explosions. Recently, Tutone
et al. 2020 have demonstrated that the Si-rich jet-like features
as seen in Cas A can be realized by a post-explosion large-scale
anisotropy (= a large clump) at the internal Si-rich layer in the
ejecta. If such anisotropy can be created bipolarly in the super-
nova, it may be able to explain the jet structure seen in Cas A.
However, we do not have any plausible mechanisms to create
such bipolar large-scale anisotropy at the Si-rich layer of super-
novae for now. To create such a bipolar feature, it would be
easier to assume a MHD jet or a B-ﬁeld-modiﬁed wind from its
proto-neutron star (Burrows et al. 2005). On the other hand, this
mechanisms may also require a high-temperature jet and further
studies would be needed to understand it. As discussed above,
currently we do not have any plausible candidates for explaining
all the properties of the Cas A jet. Further theoretical researches
would be needed for explaining such a “weak” jet that has a low
<
peak temperature (Tpeak
∼ 5 GK) during its formation. The
estimation of the peak temperature, combined with the jet en-
ergy of ∼1048 up to 1050 erg (Laming et al. 2006; Schure et al.
2008; Fesen & Milisavljevic 2016), will provide a strong con-
straint on the formation process of the jet structure. To test jet
mechanisms comparing with the observational properties will
be helpful to understand the origin of this peculiar feature in
this remnant.

The r-process nucleosynthesis predicted in jet-like ex-
plosions
supernovae
(Nishimura et al. 2015; Nishimura et al. 2017) would be also
useful to discuss the elemental composition in the NE jet. In
particular, the observed Ti- and Cr-rich ejecta may be explained
by r-process nucleosynthesis in an extreme high-entropy and
neutron-rich environment. However, there appears to be a
challenge in the high-temperature jet mechanism to leave a
certain amount of light elements (such as Si, S) as observed.

5 Summary

The origin of the jet structure of Cas A, the most obvious bipo-
lar structure of all the observed remnants, has been debated for
years. In this research, we have discovered the emissions from
highly ionized Ti in the NE jet of Cas A with Chandra, which
provides us unique information to elucidate its origin. We have
estimated the Ti mass is (0.44–2.4)×10−5 M(cid:12) in the jet region.
The estimated Ti mass is too large to be explained by only ra-
dioactive 44Ti, therefore we have concluded that the emissions
mainly originate from stable Ti isotopes possibly 48Ti. While
the stable Ti is produced at both the incomplete Si burning and
α-rich freezeout regimes, the observed elemental composition

in the jet region supports the incomplete Si burning origin very
well. Thus, it does not support extremely hot jets that could be
launched from around its proto-neutron star. We have estimated
that the peak temperature during the nuclear burning for the jet
<
formation should be Tpeak
∼ 5 GK at most, which would tightly
limit the energy of the jet. Currently, we do not have a plausi-
ble model to explain all the observational properties of the jet
structures. We hope that future theoretical approaches will shed
light on this origin.
