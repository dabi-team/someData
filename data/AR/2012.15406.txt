Abstract

SDO/AIA images the full solar disk in several EUV bands that are each sensitive to

coronal plasma emissions of one or more speciﬁc temperatures. We observe that when

isolated active regions (ARs) are on the disk, full-disk images in some of the coronal

EUV channels show the outskirts of the AR as a dark moat surrounding the AR. Here

we present seven speciﬁc examples, selected from time periods when there was only a

single AR present on the disk. Visually, we observe the moat to be most prominent
in the AIA 171 ˚A band, which has the most sensitivity to emission from plasma at
log10T = 5.8. By examining the 1D line-of-sight emission measure temperature distri-
bution found from six AIA EUV channels, we ﬁnd the intensity of the moat to be most
depressed over the temperature range log10T ≈ 5.7 − 6.2 for most of the cases. We
argue that the dark moat exists because the pressure from the strong magnetic ﬁeld

that splays out from the AR presses down on underlying magnetic loops, ﬂattening

those loops – along with the lowest of the AR’s own loops over the moat – to a low
altitude. Those loops, which would normally emit the bulk of the 171 ˚A emission,
are restricted to heights above the surface that are too low to have 171 ˚A-emitting
plasmas sustained in them, according to Antiochos & Noci [1986], while hotter EUV-

emitting plasmas are sustained in the overlying higher-altitude long AR-rooted coronal

loops. This potentially explains the low-coronal-temperature dark moats surrounding

the ARs.

Introduction

The Sun’s outer atmosphere, the corona, resides beyond the 6000 K solar surface and extends
into the inner heliosphere. It is characterized by temperatures near and upward of 106 K, and
hence radiates strongly in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray portion of the spectrum.
Photographs in broad-band X-rays, such as from Skylab in the 1970s [Rosner et al., 1978]
and later from X-ray telescopes on the Yohkoh [Ogawara et al., 1991] and Hinode [Kosugi
et al., 2007] missions, show three prominent large-scale morphological coronal regions. First
there is the general roughly uniform glow characteristic of quiet regions, second are localized
comparatively bright locations in active regions (ARs), and third are the regions that appear
dark in the X-ray images and hence are known as coronal holes. Often the coronal holes are
localized around the polar regions (polar coronal holes), but they also can extend down to
lower latitudes from the polar regions, or even develop at lower latitudes isolated from the
poles (equatorial coronal holes) [Harvey & Recely, 2002].

This overall coronal morphology reﬂects the strength and topology of the magnetic ﬁeld
in the various regions: In ARs, the ﬁeld is stronger and consists largely of dynamic loops,
upon which coronal heating is obviously strong, resulting in relatively high temperatures
(few times 106 K) and high intensity in X-rays and EUV [Warren et al., 2003, Winebarger
et al., 2003]. The corona in quiet regions consists largely of weaker-ﬁeld closed magnetic
loops, including some of a size scale larger than that of ARs. Their temperature (∼106 K)
is lower than that of coronal loops in ARs due to their weaker heating resulting from the
weaker ﬁeld strength and less-dynamic magnetic activity at their photospheric roots. Finally,
coronal holes in contrast occur where the magnetic ﬁeld is of quiet-region strength but is
largely unipolar, and is “open” in the sense that it extends far into the heliosphere, with a
relatively low coronal temperature because the coronal plasma and its thermal energy are
eﬃciently lost to the solar wind. [See, e.g. Withbroe & Noyes, 1977, for discussions of coronal
temperature and structure.]

The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) [Lemen et al., 2012] onboard the Solar Dy-
namics Observatory (SDO) [Pesnell et al., 2012] observes the corona in seven diﬀerent EUV
channels. The passband for each of the channels however is narrower than the above-
discussed broadband X-ray images, with the result being that each channel tends to sample
a diﬀerent temperature regime of the corona, with the channels and their respective approx-
imate peak coronal log10 temperature values being [Lemen et al., 2012] 304 ˚A (4.7), 171 ˚A
(5.8), 193 ˚A (6.2), 211 ˚A (6.3), 131 ˚A (5.6), 94 ˚A (6.8), and 335 ˚A (6.4). (There are however
additional peaks, and overlaps in the response curves; see Lemen et al. [2012] and Boerner
et al. [2012] for details.)

AIA regularly images the full-disk Sun, which allows for unprecedented inspection of the
large-scale corona in diﬀerent temperature regimes. We observed that in some channels,
with the primary one seeming to be 171 ˚A, that ARs on the visible disk frequently are
surrounded by an annular darker moat-like region, with the AR emitting brightly interior to
that annulus, and with the quiet Sun emitting with brightness typical of the quiet Sun in
regions exterior to that annulus. Figure 1 shows an example from AIA 171 ˚A, where the AR
is near disk center. Although we have not carried out a quantitative survey of their frequency,
our inspection of AIA images shows such dark moats around ARs to be common, often being
visible as outskirts of ARs throughout the solar cycle. Often the moats completely surround
the ARs, while sometimes they appear to be in more restricted locations, where perhaps
however the brighter parts of those regions are due to bright loops of the AR blocking the
view of the moat along the line-of-sight through the bright loops. Here we will attempt to
understand the nature of these moats by studying seven examples, at times when there was
a single AR on the Sun, and when that AR was located near disk center.

These moats are distinct from coronal holes, which tend to be dark across the six hotter
AIA EUV wavelength passbands [e.g. Garton et al., 2018]; that includes all seven AIA EUV
bands except for 304 A, which mostly shows the lower cooler transition region, the intensity
of which is not as strongly aﬀected by the presence of coronal holes as some of the hotter
channels [e.g., Hamada et al., 2018].
In the cooler of the six hotter AIA EUV channels
(171, 193, 211, 131 ˚A), the coronal holes stand out compared to the surrounding quiet-Sun
corona, which radiates brightly at those wavelengths. In the two hotter channels (94 and
335 ˚A), the coronal holes and much of the surrounding quiet Sun can both be uniformly
dark, since neither the coronal-hole plasma or the quiet-Sun plasma radiates well at those
wavelengths. In contrast, as we will see below (cf. Fig. 2), the moats around the ARs are
dark primarily in 171 ˚A, along with some other wavelengths, including 304 ˚A, but less so or
not at all in other wavelengths (due to overlying bright loops along the line of sight), such
as 193 ˚A. Moreover, some of the moat area can even be brighter than surrounding corona
in some wavelengths, such as 211 ˚A in the case of Fig. 2. We will examine the visibility as
a function of temperature for the seven examples we examine in the following.

Wang et al. [2011] studied moat regions like ours in AIA 171 ˚A images and line-of-sight
magnetograms; they also described them as moat-like, but primarily referred to them as
“dark canopies” around ARs. They pointed out that the chromospheric counterpart of these
regions are populated by dark Hα ﬁbrils aligned with AR magnetic ﬁeld that have been
studied by a number of authors [e.g. Howard & Harvey, 1964, Foukal, 1971, Reardon et al.,
2009]. Wang et al. [2011] suggested that the moat regions consist of low-lying EUV-absorbing
ﬁbril structures that connect opposite magnetic polarities. Here we will study in more detail

2

the thermal properties of the dark regions. We will then consider a diﬀerent idea for the lack
of emission from the dark regions, based on theoretical predictions for the thermal stability
of coronal loops at low heights. We will argue that a moat forms when loops rooted in these
regions, along with the lowest of the AR’s own loops over these regions, are pushed down to
low-enough heights by the overlying strong magnetic ﬁeld that loops out from the AR.

The bright region near disk center is active region NOAA AR 12699. A roughly circular
moat-like annulus of low emission clearly surrounds the active region. North is up and west
is to the right in this and in all other solar images in this paper. We have visually drawn a
black boundary surrounding this dark region.

Instruments and Data

We use images from SDO/AIA from all seven EUV channels, so that we can diﬀerentiate
structures based on their temperature [Pesnell et al., 2012]. AIA has 0(cid:48)(cid:48).6 pixels, and takes
a full-disk image every 12 s in each of the EUV channels during nominal periods; see Lemen
et al. [2012] for more details. We use aia prep.pro in IDL’s SolarSoft library to read in and
calibrate AIA level 1 data to level 1.5. Level 1 data are already processed with bad-pixel
removal, de-spiking and ﬂat-ﬁelding. Level 1.5 data additionally have roll-correction making

solar north vertical in the images, rescaling of the images to 0(cid:48)(cid:48).6 pixels, and translation that
puts solar disk center at the image center. We also use line of sight (LOS) magnetograms
from SDO’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument to observe the photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld [Schou et al., 2012, Hoeksema et al., 2014]. HMI has 0(cid:48)(cid:48).5 pixels, and is capable
of high cadence (45 s) although for this study we generally used only a single representative
magnetogram for each region [Schou et al., 2012]. The HMI data are read using hmi prep.pro
in IDL, which processes the magnetograms to have correct role angle, and translates the
magnetograms to put solar disk center at the magnetogram centers. Scherrer et al. [2012]
provide more details on HMI. We use full resolution 4096 × 4096 pixel data for both AIA
and HMI.

As mentioned above, we examine ARs that are isolated on the Sun, when they are near
the center of the disk. This allows us to show clearly the moat-like regions of missing “cool”
corona around the ARs, and also allows for more accurate AR magnetic ﬂux measurements
in our analysis since the LOS magnetograms lose their accuracy away from the solar disk
center. Table 1 gives the dates of observations used in this work, along with the NOAA
AR numbers of the active regions under consideration. In cases 5 and 6, the regions have
decayed to a point where they no longer have sunspots, and hence they no longer have a
NOAA AR designation. For those cases, we provide the AR number for the previous rotation
in the table notes. Case 5 is the same region as case 4, but one rotation later. The time of
observations in all the cases is 06:04 UT.

Although we ﬁnd the dark moats around ARs to be a very common phenomenon during
both solar maximum and solar minimum periods (see §4), our selected regions for this study
are biased towards solar minimum since it is almost impossible to ﬁnd intervals during solar
maximum periods with just one AR at the solar disk. By looking at solar magnetogram
synoptic maps for all Carrington rotations, we found only seven periods where the solar disk

4

had just one major AR since SDO’s 2010 launch, and these are the cases we selected for
study here (Table 1).

3 Observations and Analysis

In this section, we will show the morphology of the dark moats surrounding ARs, and
also present quantitative analysis conﬁrming that there is a dip in emission at cool coronal
temperatures in these regions.

3.1 AIA morphology

In the previously introduced Figure 1, we show an AIA 171 ˚A image of the Sun for case 1
of Table 1, as observed on 2018 Feb 11 at 06:04 UT. The AR, near disk center, is NOAA
region AR 12699. A roughly circular moat of low emission can clearly be seen around this
AR. At this wavelength, the emission from this dark moat appears comparable to that from
the polar coronal holes, visible at the south pole and in the eastern part of the north pole.
In fact, we found that the average emission in the moat region for this case was 96.2 DNs,
whereas the average emmision in the coronal hole at the southern pole was 100.8 DNs.

To further examine the moat region of case 1, in Figure 2 we show cutouts of size 840(cid:48)(cid:48) ×
660(cid:48)(cid:48) of this region for EUV images in diﬀerent wavelengths, and for the HMI magnetogram.
We ﬁnd that the area of low emission measure is most clearly seen in the 171 ˚A wavelength,
whose response function peaks in the temperature range of 0.6—1.1 MK. In contrast, the
dark moat is substantially less prominent in the 193, 211 and 335 ˚A wavebands. We will
continue to refer to such features as “moats” or “dark moats” throughout the rest of the
paper, whereas the surrounding brighter areas are refereed to as “bright regions.” The
magnetogram shows an area of mixed polarity in the dark moat.

Based on Figure 2 the moat appears to be most prominent in 171 ˚A. Although less
prominent, it is also detectable in 304 ˚A, 131 ˚A, 94 ˚A, and 335 ˚A. It is still less prominent
in 193 ˚A, with the moat visible but not standing out. Strikingly, in 211 ˚A the dark moat is
nearly absent. The reduced or total lack of visibility of the moat in at least two wavelengths,
193 ˚A and 211 ˚A, along with it being apparent in 304 ˚A, are marked diﬀerences from the
situation with coronal holes. This suggests that the ﬁeld is not largely open, as in the case
of true coronal holes. A diﬀerent physical process from that operating in coronal holes must
be responsible for the moats being dark.

To quantify the emission diﬀerences between moat and non-moat regions in diﬀerent
wavelengths, we ﬁnd the average emissions in these regions for all 7 cases. To ﬁnd these

averages, we select the moat outer boundaries by eye and visually discard the area covered
by the AR using 171 ˚A images. The visually found moat and AR boundaries for Case 1
are shown in Figure 3. The outer moat boundaries for cases 2 to 7 can be seen in Figure 4.
The external non-moat region is the surrounding area outside this manually selected moat
region, and largely consists of quiet Sun. To reduce the eﬀect of EUV limb-brightening in
our average calculations, we only include the non-moat area within 60◦ of disk center. The
results are presented in Table 2, where in each case the moat and AR-boundary contours
determined from the 171 ˚A image were applied to the corresponding images of the other
channels. These values show that, on average, the moat regions are signiﬁcantly darker in
171 ˚A and 131 ˚A, they are comparable in intensity to non-moat regions in 304 ˚A, 95 ˚A, and
335 ˚A, and are brighter in 193 ˚A and 211 ˚A wavelengths.

In Figure 4, we show similar cutouts of size 1380(cid:48)(cid:48) × 900(cid:48)(cid:48) around ARs for Table 1 cases 2
to 7 in the 171 ˚A wavelength. Dark moat regions are present around the ARs in each of
the cases. These moats vary greatly in shape and size for the diﬀerent ARs, and they often
are not symmetric. Moreover, the character of the apparent boundary can vary in diﬀering
regions: case 1 (Fig. 2) has a relatively sharp boundary between the dark moat and the
surrounding bright regions; in contrast, cases 2 through 6 show a more gradual transition
from the dark moat to the bright regions, with case 7 being closer to case 1 in this regard.

3.2 DEM analysis

In Figure 2, the AR dark moat is more prominent in some of the AIA passbands than
others. This is a reﬂection of the temperature distribution of the coronal plasma along
the line-of-sight from the SDO satellite to the moat on the Sun, since the respective ﬁlters
respond preferentially to plasmas respectively radiating at diﬀering temperatures. Although

which has the strongest response to emissions over the temperature range 0.6—1.1 MK.

for the AR boundary (the inner boundary of the moat region), which surrounds the AR and
the brightest 171 ˚A loops extending out from the AR.

the intensity in diﬀerent AIA passbands peaks at particular temperatures, their response
functions have contributions from plasma from over a larger range of temperatures. The
response functions of diﬀerent channels of AIA as a function of temperature can be seen
in Fig. 1 of Cheung et al. [2015]. We can quantitatively examine the distribution with
temperature of the plasma along the line of sight from the observer through any imaged
solar feature, by estimating the diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) function [Withbroe,

The case number for each appears in the panels, and the dates and times are those listed in

wavelength-channel i in an image can be written

(1)

Here, Ki contains the response function for ﬁlter i, and accounts for the atomic processes
responsible for the emission from the plasma detected by that ﬁlter; this is a function of
the temperature, T . By using the intensities in diﬀerent AIA ﬁlters for a given location
on the Sun, it is possible to estimate the DEM, the distribution with temperature of the
square of the density of the emitting plasma along the line of sight, through inversion of the
integral equation, eq. 1. We have done this for each of the regions in Table 1, using the pro-
cedure outlined in Cheung et al. [2015]. Their method, available in IDL SolarSoft as routine

8

aia sparse em init.pro, uses AIA data in 94, 131, 171, 193, 211, and 335 ˚A wavelengths to
give DEM maps, showing the total emission measure (EM) in diﬀerent temperature ranges,
where EM is DEM(T ) integrated over a speciﬁed temperature range. We have detailed the
method used by Cheung et al. [2015] to calculate EM in Appendix A.

Figure 5 shows EM maps for the AR of Table 1 case 1, with the diﬀerent panels showing
the total EM contained within the speciﬁed temperature ranges. In our implementation of
the aia sparse em init.pro routine, we have used 21 log T bins of size 0.1, with the lower
limit of 5.7. The cutout size is 1380(cid:48)(cid:48) × 900(cid:48)(cid:48), and is centered on the AR. The dark moat
visible in Figure 2 is most clearly seen in the log temperature range 5.75 to 6.05, consistent
with the coronal emission being greatly suppressed in the dark moat in this temperature
range.

Figure 6 displays similar EM maps for Table 1 cases 2 to 7 in this same temperature
range (log(T ) =[5.75,6.05]). In each of these cases, the dark moat shows substantial EM
depletion, consistent with the visual appearance in Figure 4.

To further study the dependence of emission measure on temperature, we sample areas
in the dark moats and surrounding quiet regions and compare the average EMs in the two
areas. For dark moats, we sample area inside a visually drawn boundary and visually exclude
the area showing AR loops. The visually identiﬁed moat and AR boundaries for Case 1 were
shown in Figure 3. For normal quiet-region areas, we consider all the area outside the moat
boundary except the area outside 60o from disk center to avoid sampling areas with limb-
brightening in the EUV data. The average EM value is calculated in each of these two
areas and plotted as a function of temperature in the right panel of Figure 7. The plot
clearly shows less emission measure in the dark moat compared to bright region over the
low-temperature range of ∼0.6—1.3 MK.

We have performed the same analysis for all the other cases of Table 1 as well, and the
results are shown in Figure 8. In each case, there is less EM in the moat compared to the
non-moat quiet region over roughly the same low-temperature range. There is a striking
consistency in the diﬀerence in average EM values for all the seven cases. The moat has a
lower EM value in the ∼0.7—0.9 MK range in all the cases. The moat regions also show
EM values larger than the EM values in non-moat quiet regions in ∼1.3—5.0 MK range, as
should be expected from the AR’s hot coronal loops overlying the moat.

To increase conﬁdence in the EM features deduced with the aia sparse em init.pro rou-
tine [Cheung et al., 2015], we also examined our Case 1 region using an independent DEM
analysis method, namely that of Aschwanden et al. [2013] and which is implemented in So-
larSoft in the aia teem map2.pro routine. Aschwanden et al. [2013] [also see Aschwanden
& Boerner, 2011] take a more commonly used “forward-ﬁtting” approach to solving the EM

9

problem, whereby they assume a form for the EM as a function of log T (in the form of
Gaussian or combinations of Gaussians in their case). They then vary parameters of the
assumed EM until the resulting predicted intensity best matches the observed AIA intensity
in each pixel, considering all six AIA coronal channels. See Aschwanden & Boerner [2011]
and Aschwanden et al. [2013] for details.

A plot similar to the right panel of Figure 7 from the Cheung et al. [2015] inversion
method is shown in Figure 9 from the Aschwanden et al. [2013] inversion method. We see
the same behavior of the diﬀerence in moat and non-moat EM curves in Figure 9 as in the
EM curves in Figure 7. The EM values calculated by these two methods do not match
perfectly. However, the peak EM values calculated by both methods match well, though
at slightly diﬀerent temperatures. Thus, both the Cheung et al. [2015] method and the
Aschwanden et al. [2013] method independently show the moat regions to have reduced
intensity over approximately 0.7—0.9 MK, and increased emission over approximately 1.3—
5.0 MK, compared to the non-moat quiet regions.

94, 131, 171, 193, 211, and 335 ˚A images, following the method described by Cheung et al.
[2015]. All of the AIA images used here are from 2018 Nov 02 06:04 UT. The color-coding,
indicated in the color bar, represents the total emission measure (EM) contained within the
log T range shown in the bottom left corner of each panel. The cutout size is 1380(cid:48)(cid:48) × 900(cid:48)(cid:48).
From the color bar, white represents the greatest emission; the low-emission dark moat is
pronounced in the lowest temperature range. We have visually drawn the boundary of the
moat in the AIA 171 ˚A image and overplotted it here as the white contour.

cutout size is 1380(cid:48)(cid:48) × 900(cid:48)(cid:48) and the color-bar is the same as in Fig. 5. Each case clearly shows
low emission measure in the moat that appeared dark in the corresponding image in Fig. 4.
This demonstrates that the moat-like dark regions around ARs are dark because they are
deﬁcient in plasma over this temperatures range. We have visually drawn the boundary of
the moat in each AIA 171 ˚A image in Figure 4 and overplotted it here as the white contour.

3.3 Potential Magnetic Field Structure

To explore the explanation for the presence of these moat regions, we ﬁrst examine the mag-
netic ﬁeld topology in the regions. We use the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model
[Schatten et al., 1969, Schrijver & De Rosa, 2003], which uses HMI synoptic magnetograms
of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld as an input for calculating the potential magnetic ﬁeld in
the corona. The source surface, above which the magnetic ﬁeld lines are taken to be radial,
was chosen the be at 2.5 R(cid:12).

Figure 10 shows the magnetic ﬁeld lines obtained using the PFSS model for case 1,
over-plotted over the 171 ˚A image of Figure 1. We have used the pf ss viewer package in

or near the dark moat. We ﬁnd various resulting magnetic-ﬁeld-line connections originating
from the moat to a sunspot in the AR, from the moat to bright quiet-Sun
in the moat:
locations, and also ﬁeld lines rooted in the moat that open out into the heliosphere. Thus
we cannot identify any special outstanding characteristic of the potential ﬁeld rooted in
the moat surrounding the AR. We have tried plotting much larger numbers of lines in the
vicinity of the AR, but no special characteristic could be identiﬁed for lines rooted in the
moat.

Because we do not see any systematic pattern in the resulting magnetic ﬁeld topology,
we conclude that the PFSS solution alone is insuﬃcient for explaining the origin of these
AR-surrounding dark moats. Moreover, the presence of closed loops with one end rooted in
the dark moat reaﬃrms that the moat is not a coronal-hole region.

3.4 Possible Cause: Flat Loops

In this section, we consider a diﬀerent possible explanation for the dark-moat regions, one
that relies on the coronal loops in the outskirts of the AR being forced to be ﬂat (nearly
horizontal to the solar surface) by the pressure of the overlying strong magnetic ﬁeld of the
AR.

the method described in Fig. 7. In all cases, we observe the emission measure in temperature
range ∼log T=5.8—6.1 MK to be less in the moat-like dark regions around ARs than in the
surrounding normal-brightness quiet Sun. EM has the units of cm−5 and T has units of
Kelvin.

This is the background to our concept. Antiochos & Noci [1986] explain the structure of
the static corona by pointing out that there are two possible models for coronal loops; that
is, the coronal-loop energy-balance equations admit two diﬀerent possible solutions. These
two solutions are: (1) a hot-loop model and (2) a cool-loop model; respectively yielding loops
of temperature > 105 K, and between about 2 × 104 and 1 × 105 K. They argued that the
hot solution is only available for loops that reach high-enough heights compared to the local
coronal density scale height. Speciﬁcally, they say that the hot solution only works on loops
with heights of >
∼5000 km; the hot solution becomes thermally unstable for loops having top

heights lower than 5000 km. Consequently, if the loops have top heights less than ∼5000 km
they are restricted to temperatures only in the range of about 2 × 104—1 × 105 K. Thus, in

14

5.566.57log T2021222324252627log EMCase 1Moat regionNon-moat regionthe general solar atmosphere, all of the one-million- and multi-million-K hot coronal loops
are those that have top heights in excess of ∼5000 km. This theoretical result is key to our
suggested explanation for the dark moats surrounding ARs.

Because the moats have a propensity to be dark in only the cooler-temperature AIA
channels, we suspect that coronal loops that would normally emit largely in the temperature
range ∼0.5—1.0 MK get ﬂattened to heights less than ∼5000 km, meaning that the hot
solution stops working for them and only the cool solution of Antiochos & Noci [1986] is
available. Such low-lying loops therefore would not emit strongly at wavelengths from plasma
in that temperature range. Thus, if the loops in the outskirts of ARs that would normally
emit in this ∼0.5—1.0 MK range, in particular the loops that would normally emit in the
AIA 171 ˚A band, are ﬂattened to low heights, then this could explain why such regions are
dark in images taken with ﬁlters sensitive to such wavelengths. Such ﬂattened loops would
tend to have temperatures below 105 K, and therefore they would tend to be dark in emission
from plasma that emits in the AIA 171 ˚A band.

We suspect that this is the explanation for the moat regions. Because the loops that tend
to emit in 171 ˚A in the normal quiet Sun (e.g., non-moat quiet Sun) are those that tend not
to be too long [this follows from the loop-scaling law, e.g., Rosner et al., 1978], such loops
would, on average, have footpoints that are not far separated compared to the size of the
AR. We expect that the overlying magnetic ﬁeld of the adjacent AR imparts a downward
magnetic pressure high enough to conﬁne such relatively short loops in the outskirts of the
AR, along with the lowest of the AR’s loops that splay out from the AR, to low enough
heights to bring their temperatures below ∼105 K.

To examine the plausibility of this claim, we estimate the region around the ARs where the
ﬁeld pressure of the overlying splay of magnetic ﬁeld from the AR is suﬃcient to suppress the
heights of coronal loops in those surrounding regions. In order to suppress those surrounding
loops, the magnetic pressure of the AR’s outskirt ﬁeld over the moat regions should be higher
than beyond the non-moat regions and the moat boundaries should mark where the magnetic
pressure has weakened to comparable to the magnetic pressure at the base of the corona in
the quiet sun regions outside the moat.

The ﬁrst step then is to determine the magnetic pressure at the coronal-base heights
everywhere on the Sun. We do this by using the HMI synoptic magnetograms to create
PFSS solutions using the Finite Diﬀerence Iterative Potential-ﬁeld Solver (FDIPS) for all
seven cases in Table 1 [Toth et al., 2016]. We then calculate the magnetic pressure using
this PFSS solution on a surface with radius 1.03R(cid:12) (20,000 km above the photosphere). The
synoptic magnetogram for Case 1 and the corresponding PFSS pressure at 1.03R(cid:12) is shown in
the top panels of Fig. 11. In the bottom-right panel of Fig. 11, the pressure surface has been

15

made semi-translucent so that the synoptic magnetogram used to obtain the PFSS solution
can be seen below it on the spherical surface of the Sun’s photosphere. Next, we overplot
the moat boundary found visually from the corresponding AIA 171 ˚A image (bottom-left
panel of Fig. 11) on the magnetic pressure surface. We have saturated the colorbar so that
the magnetic pressure distribution on non-moat regions is clearly visible. The quiet sun has
magnetic pressure randomly distributed between 0.01 and 0.2 dyne/cm2, but the region in
the vicinity of the AR has magnetic pressure exceeding 0.2 dyne/cm2. The moat boundaries
roughly lie where we start observing regions with magnetic pressure less than 0.2 dyne/cm2,
as we move away from the AR.

Figure 11 shows our results for this exercise for the AR of case 1 of Table 1. We can see
that the moat boundary encapsulates a high magnetic pressure region, relative to the non-
moat regions. Although the boundaries do not match exactly, there is obvious correlation
between the dark moat region in AIA 171 ˚A image and the high pressure region in the PFSS
solution. This point can be further validated by looking at the rest of the cases.

Figure 12 shows contours made in the same fashion for cases 2—7 of Table 1. In each
of the cases the results are similar, in that the moat boundaries found using AIA 171 ˚A
data again roughly bound the region of high magnetic pressure around the AR. The minor
mismatches might be due to our potential ﬁeld approximation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld
or errors in visual estimation of the moat boundaries from AIA 171 ˚A data.

Overall however, we regard the match as good enough to render plausible the idea that a
moat region around ARs is often dark in 171 ˚A and similar wavelengths because the strong
AR ﬁeld pushes down the coronal loops in that region that otherwise would emit strongly
in 171 ˚A. Those low-lying coronal loops do not emit in 171 ˚A because hot emission in loops
of any length conﬁned to low-enough heights is not allowed due to the thermal instability
pointed out by Antiochos & Noci [1986].

4 Summary and Discussion

We have re-examined the dark moats frequently seen to surround ARs in AIA EUV coronal
images, especially in emission from plasma at temperature near 1 MK. In our seven selected
cases, we found that these dark moats vary in size and shape, but are present in all of
our cases. Using DEM analysis, we found that in these moat regions, there is a dearth of
emission at temperatures centered around 0.6—1.1 MK. Since the 171 ˚A channel of AIA
is most sensitive in this temperature range, the dark moats are most pronounced in the
AIA 171 ˚A images. We performed PFSS magnetic ﬁeld analysis in the moat regions to
ﬁnd whether there was any systematic pattern for the dark moats, but we could not ﬁnd
any special magnetic topology of ﬁeld lines rooted in the moat areas to explain the reduced
emission.

By looking at the magnetic pressure distribution around the ARs using PFSS solutions,
we ﬁnd plausible the idea that these dark moats are a collateral consequence of the splay of
strong loop magnetic ﬁeld that extends out from the strong and concentrated magnetic ﬂux of
the AR. We argue that the overlying strong ﬁeld suppresses the maximum height attained
by medium-length coronal loops in those surrounding regions (where here by “medium-
length” we mean those that normally would emit in this near-1-MK temperature window,
in accordance to loop length-temperature scaling law of Rosner et al. [1978]), and also keep
the AR’s own lowest loops that low over the moat area. According to Antiochos & Noci
[1986], those height-suppressed medium-length loops, and the overlying AR-rooted lowest
loops, could only achieve temperatures of ∼105 K, due to thermal instability of the plasma
in them that ensues at higher temperatures.

The higher AR-rooted loops that stretch out over and above those low-lying moat loops
apparently achieve high-enough heights that they are not subject to the high-temperature
thermal instability. Consequently, their peak temperatures are in excess of the near-1-MK
normal temperature of unﬂattened medium-sized loops. Their temperature and consequent
plasma density and EUV emission are comparable to or greater than that of the quiet-region
corona, plausibly due to their obeying the loop scaling law and – from being rooted in the
strong magnetic ﬂux of the AR, which gives these loops heating comparable to or greater
than that of the quiet-region corona. Apparently, their heating is strong enough that they
are heated to temperatures above 1 MK. This would explain why the moats that are dark
in AIA 171 ˚A images are reduced in prominence or absent (i.e., the brightness of the AR-
outskirt regions is comparable to the non-moat quiet regions) in AIA ﬁlters sensitive to
higher-temperature emissions (Fig. 2).

Wang et al. [2011] analyzed these dark moats in 171 ˚A, and concluded that they consist

19

of 171 ˚A-EUV absorbing “ﬁbrils” that might be the coronal counterparts of the ﬁbrils as
seen in the Hα chromosphere data. They argue that the Hα ﬁbril ﬁelds at the bottom of
the corona reconnect with encountered overlying ﬁeld from the bipolar AR, resulting in a
ﬁbril-to-ﬁlament conversion, and those ﬁlaments constitute the dark moats. Their EUV-
absorbing-ﬁbril concept might complement our idea for the dark moats, as the low-lying
∼105 K, would likely absorb any 171 ˚A
cool coronal loops, expected to be of temperature <
emission from below them, if any.

For this study we selected seven cases when there was just one AR on the solar disk
to focus our eﬀorts, and all of our examples ended up being from during solar minimum.
Our inspections of AIA data at diﬀerent times over the solar cycle since SDO’s launch
in 2010 suggest that these dark moat regions are present near ARs even when there are
multiple ARs on the Sun, and throughout the solar cycle. Figure 13 shows an AIA 171 ˚A
example from 2014 Dec 17, during solar maximum. We can see that low-emission dark regions
(similar in darkness to the moats of our lone ARs) cover the entire longitude range at AR
latitudes and somewhat higher latitudes. Therefore we ﬁnd the dark moats around ARs in
the near-1-MK temperature range to be a general phenomenon. Here we have argued that
the dark moat regions are a consequence of the strong peripheral AR ﬁelds pushing down
on surrounding medium-sized coronal loops, and pushing down on the bottom-most of the
AR’s own peripheral loops, so that those loops are low-lying enough to be restricted to lower-
than-coronal temperatures, following Antiochos & Noci [1986]. This eﬀect, combined with
the presence of overlying hotter loops rooted in the AR, results in a depletion of cool-corona
plasma in the outskirts (dark moats) of ARs. This plausibly explains why the dark moat
regions are seen around ARs in cool-corona EUV images.

An unresolved aspect of our suggested explanation for the moat regions is that Antiochos
& Noci [1986] assume that coronal loops are static, while many observations indicate that AR
coronal loops are dynamically changing [e.g., Warren et al., 2003, Winebarger et al., 2003].
Those observations however have tended to focus on loops within active regions, rather than
in the periphery of the active regions where the moats form. Thus to address the question
of how dynamic motions on loops might alter our suggested mechanism for the moats, both
the nature of the dynamics of loops in the moat regions should be examined observationally,
and the consequences of the dynamic behavior of loops on loop thermal structure should
be studied with numerical simulations. To our knowledge, such studies have not yet been
carried out to address the speciﬁc question of EUV intensity in the moat regions.

Another unresolved aspect of our suggested explanation is the appearance of the moats
in 304 ˚A images. Because the 304 line is formed at about 5 × 104 K [O’Dwyer, et al., 2010],
it might be expected that the cool coronal loops, being of temperature less than 5 × 105 K,

20

might cool into the emission passband of the 304 ˚A channel, and therefore appear bright in
304 ˚A images. Yet the moats are generally visible as darker areas in 304 ˚A images (we only
make this determination visually, since the DEM procedure of §3.2 is only applicable down
to T ∼ 5×105 K). A possible explanation for this could be that material making up the dark
ﬁbrils discussed by Wang et al. [2011] could block and scatter some of the lower-altitude 304
˚A emission, leading to the reduced 304 intensity in the moats. Future spectroscopic studies
of moat regions should be beneﬁcial in understanding this and other aspects of the moat
regions.

Figure 13: An SDO AIA 171 ˚A image from 2014 Dec 17, 03:12 UT. This was during
solar maximum, while all of the examples of Table 1 are from solar minimum. Moat-like
dark regions are visible around ARs here also, and, at latitudes below ±60o, they cover a
signiﬁcant portion of the solar disk owing to the presence of numerous ARs. Thus the moat
regions occur independent of whether there is only one AR on the disk during minimum, as
in the case of the Table 1 events, or when multiple ARs are concurrently on the disk during
solar maximum.

A Emission measure calculation

Cheung et al. [2015] derive the EM in 21 sequential temperature intervals by setting up and
solving a severely underdetermined system of linear equations. They set up the system by
dividing the log T range into 21 intervals, covering 5.5 to 7.5 in increments of 0.1 in log T .
They place four mathematical functional shapes in each of the 21 intervals, each representing
some of the DEM in that temperature interval. One functional form is a delta function, with
a constant contribution to the DEM at all temperatures in that interval, and that is done
for each of the 21 intervals. The other three functional forms are Gaussian (of three diﬀering
widths), but where the Gaussians are truncated so that they do not have inﬁnitely long tails.
Thus, in total, they represent the total EM in the entire temperature range by a sum over
these 21 × 4 = 84 diﬀerent DEM functional forms, where each of the 84 DEMs is weighted
by an unknown coeﬃcient. In the case of the AIA data, there are six intensities, from the six
AIA coronal EUV channels, that can be measured at each pixel in the AIA ﬁeld of view. This
means that, for each pixel, there are six measurements with 84 unknowns, resulting in the
severely underconstrained mathematical problem. Cheung et al. [2015] proceed to solve this
mathematical problem by utilizing techniques for underconstrained systems from the ﬁeld
of “compressed sensing.” They use an approach called “sparsity” [e.g., Candes & Tao, 2006,
Candes & Tao, 2007], which includes imposing constraints on the underconstrained system.
The Cheung et al. [2015] constraints include requiring all of the 84 DEM coeﬃcients to have
non-negative values, that the sum of those coeﬃcients be minimized, and that for each of
the six AIA channels the predicted count rate (DN/s) from the model DEM be within some
tolerance of the observed count rate. The solution they arrive at gives them the EM in each
of the 21 bins at each pixel. Cheung et al. [2015] then proceed to show that this approach
produces satisfactory results using both synthetic and actual AIA data. See Cheung et al.
[2015] for more details.
