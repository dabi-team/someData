Andreev reﬂection (AR) refers to the electron-hole conversion at the normal metal-superconductor
interface. In a three-dimensional metal with spherical Fermi surface, retro (specular) AR can occur
with the sign reversal of all three (a single) components of particle velocity. Here, we predict a
novel type of AR with the inversion of two velocity components, dubbed “anomalous-trajectory
Andreev reﬂection” (AAR), which can be realized in a class of materials with torus-shaped Fermi
surface, such as doped nodal line semimetals. For its toroidal circle perpendicular to the interface,
the Fermi torus doubles the AR channels and generates multiple AR processes. In particular, the
AAR and retro AR are found to dominate electron transport in the light and heavy doping regimes,
respectively. We show that the AAR visibly manifests as a ridge structure in the spatially resolved
nonlocal conductance, in contrast to the peak structure for the retro AR. Our work opens a new
avenue for the AR spectroscopy and oﬀers a clear transport signature of torus-shaped Fermi surface.

Andreev reﬂection (AR) describes the electron-hole
conversion at the interface between a normal metal and
a superconductor, by which a pair of electrons pene-
trate into the superconductor and form a Cooper pair
[1]. It dominates the electron transport within the super-
conducting gap due to the prohibition of single-particle
transmission [2]. AR spectroscopy has become a pow-
erful tool for the detection of various properties of elec-
tronic systems, such as the pairing order parameter in
unconventional superconductors [3–5], spin polarization
of metal [6, 7], Dirac/Weyl fermion with linear dispersion
[8–10], and Majorana zero mode in topological supercon-
ductors [11, 12]. It may also have potential applications
in quantum information processing [13–15] and spintron-
ics [16].

One unique feature of the conventional AR is that the
reﬂected hole retraces the path of the incident electron
by inverting all velocity components [1], so-called retro
AR (RAR); see Fig. 1(a). Interestingly, if the incident
electron and reﬂected hole are from the conduction and
valence band respectively, specular AR (SAR) may oc-
cur [8], in which only the velocity component perpen-
dicular to the interface is inverted; see Fig. 1(b). The
SAR is hard to achieve in conventional semiconductors,
whose energy gap exceeds the superconducting gap so
as to block the reﬂected hole. However, massless Dirac
Fermion in various materials, such as graphene and topo-
logical semimetals is favorable for the observation of SAR
[8, 10, 17]. In two dimensions, the RAR and SAR consti-
tute a complete set of AR. Interestingly, the phenomenon
gets enriched in three dimensions due to the additional
velocity component.

In this Letter, we predict the third type of AR in which
two of three velocity components are inverted, dubbed
“anomalous-trajectory Andreev reﬂection” (AAR); see
Fig. 1(d) and Table I for clarity. We show that the
AAR can occur in the system with a torus-shaped Fermi

surface [18–21] as shown in Fig. 1(c), which exists in a
large category of materials called nodal line semimetals
[18–35]. The Fermi torus diﬀers in topology from the
conventional Fermi sphere, which can lead to anomalous
transport signatures [36, 37]. Here, we consider a metal-
superconductor junction oriented along the x-direction
and the toroidal circle of the Fermi torus is perpendicu-
lar to the interface. For lateral momentum (ky, kz) con-
served, there exist two AR channels with diﬀerent sign
in the lateral velocities [cf. Table I]. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd
that the AAR dominates the inter-band scattering regime
in which the electron and reﬂected hole are from diﬀerent
bands, as the sample is weakly doped such that the chem-
ical potential is much smaller than the superconducting

gap (µ (cid:28) ∆). The main feature of AAR is that only
one lateral velocity component inverts its sign, indicating
an unconventional trajectory of the reﬂected hole wave
packet, that is, extended in one direction while localized
in the other. Such a feature can be probed by nonlo-
cal scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STM), in which the
conductance exhibits a spatially resolved ridge structure,
thus providing a clear signature of AAR.

We consider a spin-degenerate nodal line semimetal

captured by the following Hamiltonian

where the Pauli matrices σx,y operate on the pseudo-spin
(orbital/sublattice), k0 is the radius of the nodal loop de-
ﬁned by the band crossing, λ and v are model parameters,
and µ is the chemical potential. In order to study the
electron-hole scattering, we work on the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes Hamiltonian for the whole junction

H = HNLΘ(−x) + HSΘ(x) + U δ(x)τz,

HNL = HNL ⊗ τz, HS = εkσ0 ⊗ τz + ∆σ0 ⊗ τx,

(2)

where Θ(x) is the unit step function and τx,z are Pauli
matrices in the Nambu space, HNL and HS correspond
to the nodal line semimetal and the conventional s-wave
superconductor, respectively, and U δ(x)τz is a δ-function
interface barrier at x = 0. The normal state energy εk =
(cid:126)2k2/(2m) − µs (relative to the chemical potential µs) in
the superconductor and the pair potential ∆ are diagonal
in the pseudo-spin space, and m is the eﬀective mass.

For a slightly doped nodal line semimetal, in which
µ (cid:28) (cid:126)λk2
0 and the Fermi surface possesses a torus shape,
we can linearize and parameterize the Hamiltonian as
HNL (cid:39) [(cid:126)v0κ(cos ϕσx+sin ϕσy)−µ]⊗τz around the nodal
loop by substituting kx = (k0 + κ cos ϕ) cos θ, ky = (k0 +
κ cos ϕ) sin θ and kz = κ sin ϕ/α, where α = v/v0 is the
ratio between the velocities in the z direction and v0 =
2λk0 in the x-y plane. All states are then speciﬁed by
the minor radius κ, toroidal angle θ, and poloidal angle
ϕ of the torus; see Fig. 1(c). The excitation energies
for electron and hole are Ee = ±(cid:126)v0κ − µ and Eh =
∓(cid:126)v0κ + µ, which are independent of θ and ϕ, with “±”
(“∓”) corresponding to the conduction and valence band,
respectively.

The Fermi torus has nontrivial eﬀects on AR by dou-
bling the reﬂection channels. Consider an electron in the
conduction band incident on the interface at x = 0 from

x = v0 cos ϕe cos θe, ve

the normal side, with energy E and transverse wave vec-
tor (ky, kz), or equivalently labeled by (κe, θe, ϕe), with
κe = (E + µ)/((cid:126)v0). There are two possible incident
states (kx > 0 or kx < 0) on the Fermi torus, and we ﬁrst
focus on the case of kx > 0 or θe ∈ (−π/2, π/2). The ve-
locity components are given by ve
y =
v0 cos ϕe sin θe and ve
z = v sin ϕe. There are two sce-
narios of AR depending on the relative magnitude of E
and µ.
(i) For E < µ, the Andreev reﬂected hole is
in the conduction band, the same as the incident elec-
tron, indicating an intra-band process; see Fig. 2(a).
There are two reﬂecting hole states: h1 : (κh, θh, ϕh) and
h2 : (κh, π − θh, π − ϕh) where κh = |E − µ|/((cid:126)v0) is the
minor radius of the hole torus, θh (cid:39) θe up to a small cor-
rection of the order κe(h)/k0, and sin ϕh/ sin ϕe = κe/κh.
Since the dispersion of the hole in the conduction band
is opposite in sign to that for the electron, the h1 state
inverts all three velocity components, that is RAR. For
the h2 state, diﬀerent reﬂection angles contribute addi-
tional minus sign to vh
z are in-
verted in the end, which is AAR. (ii) For E > µ, the
Andreev reﬂected hole is in the valence band, which is
an inter-band process. A typical case of µ (cid:39) 0 is illus-
trated in Fig. 2(b). Now the hole possesses the same
sign in dispersion as the electron, and two AR states are
˜h1 : (κh, π − θh, ϕh) and ˜h2 : (κh, θh, π − ϕh) by requiring
x < 0. Correspondingly, the hole state ˜h1 contains only
vh
the sign reversal in vh
x , being the SAR. Meanwhile, for
the state ˜h2 both vh
x and vh
y change the sign [cf. Fig.
1(d)], which is again AAR. From the qualitative analysis
above, one ﬁnds that all types of AR can occur on the
Fermi torus, as summarized in Table I.

where rh1
correspond to the SAR and AAR pro-

cesses, respectively. In this case, one ﬁnds that the AAR
dominates the electron transport with the inversion of
vx and vy. In particular, the AAR amplitude becomes
rh2
= eiϕ cos ϕ at E = ∆, solely determined by the
e1
poloidal angle ϕ. The vanishing SAR in Eq. (5) stems
from the orthogonality between the pseudo-spin texture
of the incident and reﬂected waves, i.e., (cid:104)h1|τx|e1(cid:105) = 0
for η = −1. However, the existence of an interface bar-
rier can induce multiple scattering and lead to a ﬁnite
SAR probability [cf. Fig. 3(f)]. For the incident elec-
tron e2 with kx < 0, the similar calculations for wave
functions can be done, and the corresponding AR am-

fect of the interface barrier is considered in Figs. 3(d)-(f),

as the density of states in the nodal line semimetal. In the
intra-band AR regime (E, ∆ (cid:28) µ), the current is domi-
nated by the RAR and the conductance exhibits a peak
structure localized in both y and z directions [41]; see
Fig. 4(b). In the inter-band AR regime (E, ∆ (cid:29) µ), the
AAR dominates the nonlocal transport, and the conduc-
tance exhibits a ridge structure along the z direction as
expected; see Fig. 4(c). For U (cid:54)= 0, the interface barrier
reduces the AAR while enhances the normal electron re-
ﬂection [cf. Fig. 3(f)]. Such an eﬀect is enhanced with kz
increased, and similar anomalous normal reﬂection B21
can even invert the sign of conductance at the edges of
the ridge, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Even so, the ridge
structural feature still persists, and the eﬀect of interface
barrier can be greatly weakened by setting the energy
of incident electron as close as possible to ∆, where the
Andreev resonance occurs [cf. Fig. 3(f)]. We conclude
that the nonlocal conductance spectra provide an eﬀec-
tive way to identify diﬀerent types of AR.

It is worthwhile to discuss the experimental implemen-
tation and potential application of our proposal. (i) The
main building block, Fermi torus has been reported in
doped nodal line semimetals [18–21] as well as the low-
density Rashba gases [42–46]. (ii) The local electrode of
a few nanometer size can be fabricated by various state-
of-the-art techniques [47–49]. The spatially resolved con-
ductance measurements can be achieved by a single STM
biased with the electrode. The measurements can also be
implemented by the multi-tip STM technique [50, 51],

cesses.

Since diﬀerent types of AR are featured by their lateral
velocities, it is diﬃcult to identify them by the longitu-
dinal current ﬂow across the junction. Instead, they can
be visibly revealed by the hole propagation in the y-z
plane, which manifests in the nonlocal transport mea-
surement. Consider the two-terminal setup in Fig. 4(a)
on top of the nodal line semimetal, which involves a lo-
cal electrode at xl = (−x0, 0, 0) and a movable STM tip
at xs = (−x0, y, z). An electron wave packet is injected
from the local electrode which involves contribution of all
available (ky, kz) channels, then gets Andreev reﬂected as
a hole wave packet, and ﬁnally reaches the tip. For the
RAR process, both lateral velocities change sign, so that
the hole retraces the path of the electron, which is lo-
calized in the y-z plane.
In contrast, only one lateral
velocity component is inverted in the AAR, which indi-
cates that the hole wave packet exhibits a ridge structure,
i.e., localized in one direction while extended in the other
[cf. Fig. 4(a)].

In what follows we calculate the nonlocal conduc-
tance using the Green’s function method. The elec-
tron coupling between the local terminals and the nodal
line semimetal is described by tunneling Hamiltonian
HT = (cid:80)
pαΨ(xα)+h.c., where tα is the tunnel-
ing strength in the α terminal, c†
pα is the creation opera-
tor of electron with momentum p in the α terminal, and
Ψ(x) is the ﬁeld operator in the nodal line semimetal.

surements [52–55]. Both the scale of the local electrode
and the accessible spacing between two STM tips can be
much smaller than the spreading of the ridge structure in
the z direction [cf. Fig. 4(c)] which ensure a high resolu-
tion of the signature. (iii) High-quality samples of nodal
line semimetal with ultrahigh mobility and clean surface
have been synthesized, which ensures a long mean free
path [19, 56–58]. The disorder and interface roughness
can break the lateral translational symmetry and lead to
diﬀusion, which will reduce the spatial resolution of the
signal. (iv) Apart from its novel phenomenology, AAR
also provides an eﬀective way to manipulate Cooper pair
splitting process, which may have important applications
in solid-state quantum information processing [13–15].

Transition between diﬀerent types of Andreev reﬂection

Smooth transition of real-space trajectories between diﬀerent types of AR is illustrated in Fig. S.1. For the dominant
AR processes with kx > 0, RAR gradually evolves into AAR by inverting vz as the chemical potential reduces from
µ (cid:29) ∆ to zero. Meanwhile, weak AR processes with kx < 0 undergos a transition from another type of AAR to SAR
by inverting vz as well.

Green’s function constructed by the scattering matrix

Consider a two-terminal system as the junction in the main text, the scattering states for a particle incident from

the left and right side write

m|n(cid:105)→, x > 0

(S.1)

where i, n (j, m) denote the right-moving (left-moving) modes on the left and right side, respectively. For a ﬁxed
energy, these labels specify the spinor components such as |e1,2(cid:105), |h1,2(cid:105) and the momentum of the states. The Eq. (3)
in the main text is a special case of |L(cid:105)i.

In order to make the scattering matrix unitary, the scattering coeﬃcients should include the ratio of velocity in the

x-direction. We revise the scattering states to

Consider the local electrode and STM tip coupled with the nodal line semimetal as shown in Fig. 4(a) of the
main text. The whole system is composed of two local terminals and the central scattering region: the nodal line
semimetal-superconductor junction. Following Ref. [40], we derive the general expression of the nonlocal conductance
for the system which contains a superconductor. The whole Hamiltonian in Nambu space is

Fig. S.2, where G0(eV ) = G(eV )|Aji=Bji=0 is the conductance of the uniform nanowire along the x direction. For zero
interface barrier in Fig. S.2(a), the conductance spectra resemble those of graphene [8] but with a diﬀerent physical
meaning. Here, an AAR-to-RAR crossover takes place as the chemical potential increases, which is diﬀerent from
the SAR-to-RAR transition in graphene. Moreover, for a ﬁnite interface barrier in Fig. S.2(b), even the conductance
spectra of AAR and RAR become similar and cannot be discriminated. We conclude that diﬀerent types of AR
cannot be identiﬁed by the tunneling conductance spectra.
