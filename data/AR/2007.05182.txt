ABSTRACT

A class of new solutions for Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, by choosing the ansatz eλ(r) =
1+ar2
1+br2 for metric potential, are obtained under Karmarkar condition. It is found that
a number of pulsars like 4U 1820-30, PSR J1903+327, 4U 1608-52, Vela X-1, PSR

J1614-2230, Cen X-3 can be accomodated in this model. We have displayed the na-

ture of physical parameters and energy conditions throughout the distribution using

numerical and graphical methods for a particular pulsar 4U 1820-30 and found that

the solution satisﬁes all physical requirements.

Introduction

Eversince Schwarzschild (1916) obtained the ﬁrst solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, a

plethora of exact solutions are available at present, in literature. The interest in the study of

anisotropic distrubutions has started with theoretical investigations of Ruderman (1972) and

Canuto (1974) regarding the anisotropic nature of matter distribution in ultra-high densities.

The impact of anisotropy on equilibrium of stellar conﬁguration can be seen in the pioneering

work of Bowers and Liang (1974). Herrera and Santos (1997) have studied matter distribution

incorporating anisotropy in pressure. A class of anisotropic solutions of spherically symmetric

distribution of matter have been studied by Mak and Harko (2003). Maharaj and Chaisi (2006)

have shown a procedure to generate anisotropic solutions from the known isotropic solutions.

The impact of shear and electromagnetic ﬁeld on stellar conﬁguration has been studied by

Sharma and Maharaj (2007).

A number of researchers have worked on spacetimes whose physical space obtained by putting

t = 0 has a deﬁnite geometry. Vaidya and Tikekar (1982) have studied spherical distributions

of matter on spacetime whose physical space has 3-spheroidal geometry. Charged analogue of

this metric has been studied by Patel and Kopper (1987). Tikekar and Patel (1988) have obtained

models of non-adiabatic gravitationally collapsing models with radial heat ﬂux on the background

of spheroidal spactime. The impact of anisotropy on Vaidya and Tikekar (1982) model has been

studied by Karmarkar et. al. (2007).

Tikekar and Thomas (1998) have studied relativistic models of stars on the background of

pseudo-spheroidal spacetime and have shown that it can be used to describe equilibrium

models of superdense stars. It has further shown that these models are stable under radial

modes of pulsation. Non-adiabatic gravitational collapse of spherical stars incorporating radial

heat ﬂux have been studied by Thomas et al. (2005) on the background of pseudo-spheroidal

spacetime. Chattopadhyay and Paul (2010) have obtained the higher dimensional analogue

– 4 –

of pseudo-spheroidal stellar models of Tikekar and Thomas (1999). Ratanpal et. al. (2015)

have studied spherical distribution of matter by choosing a speciﬁc form for radial pressure

on pseudo-spheroidal spacetime. Ratanpal et. al. (2016) have studied anisotropic models of

superdense stars on the background of pseudo-spheroidal spacetime.

Another useful and geometrically signiﬁcant spacetime widely used by researchers is the

paraboloidal spacetime studied by Tikekar and Jotania (2007). Tikekar and Jotania (2009) have

used this spacetime to obtain core-envelope models of superdense stars. Anisotropic models

of stars on paraboloidal spacetime admitting quadratic equation of state have been studied by

Sharma and Ratanpal (2013). New anisotropic solutions of relativistic star on paraboloidal

spacetime has been obtained by Ratanpal et. al. (2017). Thomas and Pandya (2017) have obtained

anisotropic compact star models with linear equation of state on the background of paraboloidal

spacetime.

The embedding problems are geometrically signiﬁcant problems in general theory of relativity.

It was ﬁrst studied by Schlai (1871). Nash (1956) proposed ﬁrst isometric embedding theorem.

The condition for embedding 4-dimensional spacetime in 5-dimensional Euclidean space was

derived by Karmarkar (1948). Such spacetimes are usually referred to a spacetimes of Class-I.

The Karmarkar condition is given by

R1414R2323 = R1212R3434 + R1224R1334,

(1)

Pandey and Sharma (1981) have found that for spherically symmetric spacetime metric to be

of Class-I, it is further required that R2323

= 0 in (1). Relativistic models of stars satisfying

Karmarkar’s condition have been extensively studied by Maurya et. al. (2015[a]), Maurya et. al.

(2015[b]), Maurya et. al. (2016[a]), Maurya et. al. (2016[b]), Maurya et. al. (2016[c]),

Maurya et. al. (2017[a]), Maurya et. al. (2017[b]).

In this article we have studied solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations satisfying Karmarkar

R2 , the spacetime metric reduces
to speudo-spheroidal spacetime metric considered by Tikekar and Thomas (1998). If we take

R2 and b = 1

b = 0 and a = 1

R2 , the spacetime metric reduces to paraboloidal spacetime metric discussed by

Tikekar and Jotania (2007).

We have organized the article as follows: In section 2, we have given the Einstein’s ﬁeld equations

and Karmarkar condition. The solution of Einstein ﬁeld equations under Karmarkar condition is

obtained in section 3. In section 4, physical plausibility conditions are described. The nature of

various physical quantities throughout the distribution has been examined by taking a particular

pulsar 4U 1820-30. In section 5, It has been concluded that a large variety of pulsars can be

accomodated in this model incorporating Karmarkar condition.

5. Discussion

We have used the present model to a large variety of compact stars like 4U 1820-30, PSR

J1903+327, 4U 1608-52, Vela X-1, PSR J1614-2230, Cen X-3, whose masses and radii are known

in Table 1 along with the compactiﬁcation factor. We have shown that energy and stability

conditions are satisﬁed for all pulsars listed in Table 1 for suitable bounds for the parameters a

and b depending on the radii of different pulsars under consideration. Due to the complexity of

expressions involved, it is difﬁcult to examine the physical acceptability conditions analytically.

Hence we have adopted graphical method.

In order to examine the nature of physical quantities throughout the distribution, we have

considered the pulsar 4U 1820-30 whose estimated mass is M = 1.25 M

⊙

and radius R = 9.1 km.

The expressions (31) now take the form

0.0053 < a

≤

0.0099, a > 3b.

(32)

We have taken the value of a as the upper bound 0.0099, b = 0.001 and examined the physical,

energy and stability conditions of the pulsar throughout its region of validity.

In Fig. 1 we have shown the variation of density for 0

density is a decreasing function of r. In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 we have shown the variation of radial

and transverse pressure throughout the star. It can be seen that both pressures are decreasing

centre and decreases towards the boundary. Fig. 7 indicates that the strong energy condition
