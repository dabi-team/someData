ABSTRACT

We have conducted a homogenous near-IR spectroscopic survey of 33 objects

with varying degrees of similarity to FU Orionis.

Common spectroscopic features that are characteristic of the three classical
FUors FU Ori, V1057 Cyg, and V1515 Cyg are: strong CO absorption, weak
metal absorption, strong water bands, low gravity, strong blue shifted He I ab-
sorption, and few (if any) emission lines. Based on these criteria, we classify
the 33 objects as either bona ﬁde FUors (eruption observed), FUor-like objects
(eruption not observed), or peculiar objects with some FUor-like characteristics,
and present a spectral atlas of 14 bona-ﬁde FUors, 10 FUor-like objects, and 9
peculiar objects. All objects that we classify as FUors or FUor-like have very
similar near-IR spectra. We use this spectral similarity to determine the extinc-
tion to each source, and correlate the extinction to the depth of the 3 µm ice
band. All bona ﬁde FUors still today maintain the spectrum of a FUor, despite
the eruption occurring up to 80 years ago. Most FUors and FUor-like objects
occupy a unique space on a plot of Na+Ca vs. CO equivalent widths, whereas
the peculiar objects tend to be found mostly elsewhere. Since most FUors show
a reﬂection nebula, we also present an atlas of K-band images of each target.
We found that the near-IR spectra of FUors and young brown dwarfs can be
extremely similar, a distinguishing feature being the Paschen β absorption in the
spectra of FUors. Although V1647 Ori, AR 6a, and V346 Normae had been pre-
viously classiﬁed as candidate FUors, we classify them as peculiar objects with
some FUor-like properties since their spectra now diﬀer signiﬁcantly from bona
ﬁde FUors. We conﬁrm two new FUor-like objects that were initially identiﬁed
as candidates based on their near-IR morphology.

Introduction

The major eruption of FU Ori in 1936 marked an important point in the study of
early stellar evolution, although nobody realized it at the time (Wachmann 1954). It was
Herbig (1966) who argued that FU Ori represented some phenomenon of stellar youth. In
1969 another very similar eruption took place in V1057 Cyg (Welin 1971a,b) indicating that
FU Ori was not a pathological case but a member of a new class of objects, for which
Ambartsumian (1971) coined the term FUor. In a classical study, Herbig (1977) presented
detailed optical spectra of three FUors, showing that they all possessed cool supergiant
spectra, with the peculiarity that the spectra become increasingly late when observed at
longer wavelengths, and displaying a strong lithium line. Of special importance, Herbig
demonstrated that V1057 Cyg prior to its eruption was a T Tauri star. Reviews about
FUors include Reipurth (1990), Hartmann & Kenyon (1996), Reipurth & Aspin (2010), and
(2014). Historical details about Herbig’s work on FUors are discussed in
Audard et al.
Reipurth (2016).

Hartmann & Kenyon (1985) suggested that the FUor phenomenon represents a short-
lived major increase in disk accretion, and in a series of papers they were able to explain
many of the observed features of FUors with this model. The spectral energy distributions of
FUors are reproduced well by modern disk models with accretion rates of about 10−5 M⊙ yr−1
(e.g., Zhu et al. 2008). Accretion rates of FUors are thus several orders of magnitude larger
than for typical T Tauri stars, and the FUor phenomenon may therefore play a signiﬁcant
role in the mass assembly of young stars, and may also explain the signiﬁcant luminosity
spread observed among embedded stars (e.g., Baraﬀe et al. 2012).

Various ideas have been proposed to explain the triggering of FUor outbursts. The ﬁrst
is a throttle mechanism that controls the passage of gas through the inner disk (e.g., Zhu
et al. 2009). The disk may receive gas from an infalling envelope at a diﬀerent rate than
it transfers through the disk, sometimes causing material to pile up, which may later be
released and causing an eruption. The second also deals with a disk that receives gas from
an infalling envelope and assumes that if the accretion rate through a disk increases, and
thus the disk temperature, then the opacity of the gas may rise so fast that heat becomes
trapped in the disk and a runaway situation develops during which the inner disk may be
emptied out (e.g., Bell & Lin 1994, Armitage et al. 2001). The third mechanism proposes
that a companion in an eccentric orbit perturbs the disk at periastron (Bonnell & Bastien

– 3 –

1992, Reipurth & Aspin 2004a). Perturbations by a planet (Clarke et al. 2005) or with
another member of a dense cluster (Pfalzner 2008) have also been considered. Finally, the
fourth idea assumes accretion of a large body, like a planet (Larson 1980) or a large ’gas
blob’ in a circumstellar disk (Vorobyov & Basu 2015).

George Herbig and Peter Petrov proposed an alternative to the disk model in a series
of papers (Herbig et al. 2003, Petrov & Herbig 1992, 2008), and concluded that the optical
spectra are caused by a rapidly rotating bloated star near the edge of instability, as originally
proposed by Larson (1980). Interestingly, the bloated star scenario and the disk accretion
concept are not mutually exclusive: Recent calculations of episodic accretion onto low-mass
protostars suggest that, for suﬃciently high accretion rates, the central star may expand
signiﬁcantly, thus increasing its luminosity far beyond the expectation based on its mass and
age (e.g., Hosokawa et al. 2011, Baraﬀe et al. 2012). Thus, optical spectra may primarily
refer to the central object – extended due to rotation near breakup speed (Larson 1980) –
while infrared observations are dominated by disk emission further out.

No FUor has been observed to undergo more than one eruption (although the peculiar
object V1647 Ori, which has certain FUor characteristics, had a prior outburst), but through
a statistical analysis Herbig (1977) showed that the phenomenon must be recurrent with
an outburst rate of roughly 10−4 per year per star in a star forming region. Subsequent
studies have supported this conclusion, albeit with somewhat diﬀerent outburst rates (e.g.,
Hartmann & Kenyon 1996, Hillenbrand & Findeisen 2015). Currently only about two dozen
FUors and FUor-like objects are known, and better statistics will emerge as ongoing wide
ﬁeld surveys identify new cases.

Spectroscopically FUors share certain broad characteristics: the signiﬁcant P Cygni
proﬁles at speciﬁc lines, the gradually cooler spectra at longer wavelengths, and the low-
gravity spectral appearance. But photometrically FUors form a rather heterogeneous group,
with a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in rise-times for diﬀerent objects, ranging from approximately
a year for FU Ori and V1057 Cyg to more than 15 years for V1515 Cyg, and also major
diﬀerences in decay times: V1057 Cyg has already faded to only about 2 magnitudes brighter
than its original brightness, whereas for example V883 Ori and BBW 76 are still bright more
than a century after their presumed eruptions. On much shorter timescales, EXors can
attain almost the same amplitudes as FUors, but they decay on timescales of a year and
typically have strong emission-line spectra (Herbig 2007, 2008). And some eruptive variables
defy classiﬁcation (e.g., Herczeg et al. 2016). As more and more young objects are found to
erupt (e.g., Contreras Pe˜na et al. 2016), an ever wider range of photometric behaviors may
well emerge. It thus appears likely that spectroscopic criteria will form a ﬁrmer basis for
classiﬁcation of eruptive variables. And since an increasing number of eruptions are found

– 4 –

among embedded objects, infrared spectroscopy may emerge as a critical tool to distinguish
between diﬀerent categories of objects.

In this paper, we present an atlas of near-infrared spectra of all currently accepted
or probable FUors and FUor-like objects, as well as of a few eruptive variables which are
sometimes suggested as FUors. We attempt to identify common spectroscopic characteristics
of the FUors, which may prove useful for future classiﬁcations.

2. Observations

Our observations were carried out with the 3.0 m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility
(IRTF) on Maunakea, Hawaii with the recently upgraded SpeX instrument in the short
cross-dispersed mode, which covers 0.7 µm to 2.5 µm in each exposure (Rayner et al.
2003). We used the 0.′′5 wide slit, which gives a resolving power of R=1200. Stars were
nodded along the slit, with two exposures taken at each nod position. The total exposure
time was driven by our goal to get a high S/N spectrum for each target on each night. The
individual exposure times were limited to three minutes to ensure that the telluric emission
lines would cancel when consecutive images taken at alternate nod positions were diﬀerenced.
An A0 telluric standard star was observed after at least every other science target for telluric
correction, usually within 0.1 air masses of the target. Our observing log is shown in Table 1.

An argon lamp was observed for wavelength calibration and a quartz lamp for ﬂat
ﬁelding. An arc/ﬂat calibration set was observed for each target/standard pair. The SpeX
data were ﬂat ﬁelded, extracted, and wavelength calibrated using Spextool (Cushing et al.
2004). After extraction and wavelength calibration, the individual extracted spectra were
co-added with xcombspec. Xtellcor was then used to construct a telluric correction model
using the observed A0 standard, after which the observed spectrum of the target was divided
by the telluric model. Finally, xmergeorders was used to combine the spectra in the separate
orders into one continuous spectrum. However, wavelength regions where the J, H and K
orders overlap are noisy due to atmospheric opacity, and thus the scaling of the orders can
adversely aﬀect the ﬂux ratio of lines in diﬀerent orders. As such, we did not scale the orders
prior to merging so as to best preserve the line ﬂux ratios, which is particularly important
in determining the extinction. These codes are all IDL routines written by Cushing et al.
(2004) to reduce SpeX data. Spectral line ﬂux, equivalent width, and FWHM were measured
using the SPLOT routine in IRAF.

When the observing conditions were photometric, we took K-band images for ﬂux cali-
bration using the SpeX guider camera. For these imaging data, the telescope was dithered

– 5 –

using a nine point 10′′ pattern to allow us to make ”sky ﬂats” from the data. A dark frame
was made by averaging together 10 individual dark frames of the same exposure time as the
science data. This dark was then subtracted from each target frame. Sky ﬂats were made
by scaling each dark subtracted image to have the same median value, then averaging them
together using a min-max rejection. The resulting sky ﬂat was then normalized using the
median value of the pixel counts. Each dark subtracted (but not scaled) target frame was di-
vided by this normalized sky ﬂat. The median sky value for each frame was subtracted from
each frame to set the average background counts in each frame to 0 to account for changes
in the brightness of the sky. The images were then aligned and averaged together using an
average sigma clipping rejection. Standard stars that have been observed by UKIRT through
the MKO ﬁlter set (Simons & Tokunaga 2002, Tokunaga & Simons 2002) were selected from
the UKIRT faint standard star list, and were observed for photometric calibration.

Table 2 lists details of the 33 objects discussed in this paper.

3. What is a FUor?

Attention was originally drawn to FU Ori because of its major and rapid brightening.
Similarly, the next two FUors to be recognized, V1057 Cyg and V1515 Cyg, were discovered
because of their brightenings, albeit not as rapid as that of FU Ori. In his pioneering study,
Herbig (1977) identiﬁed the optical spectroscopic characteristics of these three objects, which
are now universally accepted as ’classical’ FUors.

Since then a wealth of objects have been classiﬁed as FUors, with justiﬁcations that
range from solid to at best tenuous. It is noteworthy that there are now many objects that
have been classiﬁed as FUors based on their spectra rather than on the basis of an observed
outburst. Evidently this easily leads to a rather heterogeneous group of objects.

While Herbig’s analysis was based on optical high-resolution spectra, many of the more
recent discoveries of FUors are suﬃciently embedded that they can only be observed in the
infrared. We therefore attempt to deﬁne here the near-infrared spectral characteristics of
FUors, based on the three classical FUors discussed in Herbig (1977). In the following we
examine the near-infrared spectra of FU Ori, V1057 Cyg, and V1515 Cyg.

3.1. Near-IR Spectral Characteristics of FU Ori, V1057 Cyg, and V1515 Cyg

Figure 1 shows the near-infrared spectra in the J, H, and K bands of the three classical
FUors FU Ori, V1515 Cyg, and V1057 Cyg. All three stars have only modest extinction

– 6 –

(see Appendix A and Table 2) and their spectra in Figure 1 are not corrected for this minor
reddening. In the following we describe the spectral characteristics that these three stars
have in common.

• CO. Strong absorption at the CO bands, starting at 2.29 µm, is perhaps the most
visible characteristic of the three FUors, and in the past it has been used as a spectroscopic
characteristic to identify candidate FUors whose eruptions were not observed. However, we
caution that strong CO absorption is necessary but alone is not suﬃcient to characterize a
YSO as a FUor. Several other YSOs have spectra that show strong CO absorption (e.g., IRAS
06393+0913), but lack other important spectroscopic characteristics of FUors (Connelley &
Greene 2010). The equivalent width of the bluest CO band of FU Ori is slightly greater than
for a late-M dwarf, but less than a late-M giant (per the SpeX library, Rayner et al. 2009).

It is noticeable that our spectrum of V1057 Cyg does not show the same pronounced CO
absorption as the other two FUors. The ﬁrst near-infrared spectra of FU Ori and V1057 Cyg
were obtained 40 years ago in 1977 by Mould et al. (1978), only eight years after the eruption
of V1057 Cyg. Visual comparison of the CO bands in these spectra of FU Ori and V1057 Cyg
show them to be of equal strength (see Fig. 1 of Mould et al. 1978), as they also appear to
be in the spectra obtained in 1986 by Hartmann & Kenyon (1987). Their much weakened
appearance in our new spectra of V1057 Cyg is thus a more recent development. There seem
to be two possible explanations. First, we note that V1057 Cyg has faded considerably since
its eruption, more than any other known FUor, and it is now about 2/3 of the way down to
its pre-outburst range (e.g., Kopatskaya et al. 2013). Since most of the light from a FUor
emanates from the disk, the star (or central bloated object) may therefore now contribute
a larger fraction of the light from V1057 Cyg. Second, we speculate that the disk could
have undergone a structural change, somehow losing the outer disk regions which mainly
contribute the CO bands (see Figure 5 of Calvet et al. 1991), possibly as the result of
dynamical interactions with a binary companion.

• Water vapor bands. The continuum proﬁles of the three classical FUors super-
ﬁcially appear similar to a mid-M type star. Strong water vapor bands on each end of the
H-band window shape the H-band continuum into a characteristic triangular shape. All three
classical FUors have a ’peaky’ or ’triangular’ H-band continuum that is often interpreted as
a signature of low gravity in young stars, in contrast to the more rounded appearance seen
in evolved stars. There are also strong breaks in the continuum at 1.33 µm and 2.29 µm due
to the onset of water vapor absorption.

• Other molecular bands. The J-band spectra show rather wide absorption from
Vanadium oxide bands around 1.05 µm and 1.19 µm. These bands are highly sensitive
to gravity, and are not visible in M-dwarfs, but begin to appear at spectral type M7 for

– 7 –

higher luminosity stars (e.g., Rayner et al. 2009). The TiO bands that so dominate the red
end of optical spectra of late-type stars reach slightly into the J-band, and weak bands are
discernible in V1515 Cyg at 0.88, 0.92, and 1.11 µm, but only at 1.11 µm for the other two
sources.

• Hydrogen lines. The Paschen-α, β, γ, δ lines are pronounced absorption lines
in the J and H-bands. The Brackett series of lines are generally not observed. Brackett γ,
a line frequently observed in young stars and often associated with mass accretion, is very
weakly seen at K-band with a possible P Cygni proﬁle.

• Absence of emission lines.

In contrast to other young erupting stars like the
EXors, FUors tend to have few, if any, emission lines. As in the optical wavelength range,
the three classical FUors show emission in the J, H, K bands exclusively as strong P Cygni
proﬁles, notably at the Ca II triplet at 0.850, 0.854, and 0.866 µm. In particular, we note
that Paβ and H2 are not seen in emission, while Brγ appears very weak with a possible P
Cygni proﬁle.

• Metallic lines. Absorption from Na (2.208 µm) and Ca (2.256 µm) are weakly
observed in the three FUor spectra. The EW of these lines is less than half that of a late-M
giant. For 9 photospheric lines from several species, the median of the ratio of EWs measured
in the spectrum of FU Ori compared to an M7 giant is 0.55.

• Helium I. The He I line at 1.083 µm is a pronounced absorption line in the spectra
of all three FUors. The blue edge of the line has a velocity of –300 kms−1, –400 kms−1, and
–400 kms−1 for FU Ori, V1515 Cygni, and V1057 Cygni, respectively.

• Gradual change of spectral type with wavelength. We note that the main
optical spectroscopic peculiarity recognized by Herbig (1977) in these three stars, namely
the gradual change towards later spectral types at longer wavelengths, is not obvious from
the J to the K band, presumably due to the rather low spectral resolution. But the overall
spectral type of the three stars is late M, which is much later than the spectral types derived
by Herbig in the optical range.

In summary, each of the above spectral characteristics of the three classical FUors is
seen in other stars. But if one focuses only on young stars, the combination of these spectral
characteristics is unique to the FUors. Hence the ﬁrst task when faced with a potential
new FUor is to establish – or at least make plausible – the youth of an erupting object.
While lithium oﬀers one such assurance in optical spectra, no similar line is available in the
near-infrared. Hence, for embedded objects for which lithium is unobservable, an infrared
excess, an association with a reﬂection nebula, or at least association with a star forming

– 8 –

region or molecular cloud, are important additional criteria. 1

In consequence, attaching the label of FUor or FUor-like to an object will necessarily be
done with varying degrees of conﬁdence, depending on how many of the above characteristics
are observed. In many cases, the ﬁrm classiﬁcation of an object as a FUor or FUor-like object
will require the gradual accumulation over time of the necessary information.

4. Comments on Individual Objects

In the following we evaluate the spectra and the photometric histories together with
other pertinent information for each of 33 objects, all of which have at some point been
suggested as FUors. Table 2 lists basic information about each of the 33 objects as well as
our evaluation of their classiﬁcation. Table 3 presents the basis for our classiﬁcation of each
object.

Not all of these objects have been observed to undergo an eruption. We therefore
divide the 33 objects into three categories: (1) bona ﬁde FUors with spectra displaying the
near-infrared spectral characteristics recognized in Section 3 and with witnessed eruptions,
(2) FUor-like objects that similarly have spectra like FUors but for which an eruption was
not witnessed, and (3) objects that have (or have had) some spectral similarities to FUors,
In Appendix C, we
but enough diﬀerences that a FUor classiﬁcation is not warranted.
additionally describe a few objects that in the past have been erroneously classiﬁed as FUors.

4.1. Bona Fide FUors

We here discuss 14 objects that have been observed to erupt and whose spectra are
very similar to those of the classical FUors discussed in Section 3, and which we therefore
deem to be bona ﬁde FUors. Their near-infrared spectra are shown in the spectral atlas in
Figure 2. Since some of these 14 objects suﬀer considerable extinction, we have dereddened
their spectra and plotted them next to each other in Figure 3, which facilitates a direct
comparison of their spectra with those of the three classical FUors. The He I absorption line
and the CO absorption bands are important characteristics of FUors, and these features are
shown in detail in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.

1A similar condition was required by Herbig (1960) when he deﬁned what is now known as
Herbig Ae/Be stars. When later researchers abandoned the requirement of a reﬂection nebula,
the catalogs of Herbig Ae/Be stars became polluted with many stars that are not young.

– 9 –

RNO 1b: This object, also known as V710 Cas, was identiﬁed as a new FUor by Staude
& Neckel (1991), who noticed that it had brightened by at least 3 magnitudes between 1978
and 1990. Their optical spectrum is consistent with a FUor, showing Hα and Li in absorption,
with a blueshifted absorption trough at Hα. The near-IR spectrum in Greene & Lada (1996)
and the one shown here show strong CO absorption, ’triangular’ H band, and a clear break
in the continuum at 1.33 µm from water vapor.

V582 Aurigae: The amateur astronomer Anton Khruslov discovered the eruption of
this star (Samus 2009). It is located in the L1516 cloud at a distance of 1.3 kpc (Kun et al.
2017). Semkov et al. (2013) found that the eruption happened between late 1984 and early
1985 based on archival photographic plates, and showed that the optical spectrum displays
typical strong P Cyg proﬁles at Hα and the Sodium doublet. Our spectrum is the ﬁrst IR
spectrum of this target, and it shows the typical FUor characteristics: CO absorption, a
’triangular’ H band, and a clear water vapor break in the continuum at 1.33 µm.

V883 Orionis: This source is optically very faint but at infrared wavelengths it is one
of the most luminous sources in the L1641 cloud in Orion. The source was suggested as a
FUor by Strom & Strom (1993) based on an optical spectrum of its reﬂection nebula which
shows a blueshifted absorption proﬁle of Hα. The K-band spectrum presented in Reipurth &
Aspin (1997) showing strong CO absorption and a featureless continuum is consistent with
our spectrum, which additionally shows the characteristic triangular H-band continuum, a
strong break at 1.33 µm, VO bands, and no emission lines. The source is associated with
the little HH object HH 183, and illuminates the small optical reﬂection nebula IC 430. The
IC 430 nebula was signiﬁcantly larger and brighter in 1888 when – as discussed by Strom &
Strom (1993) – Pickering (1890) photographed the region. This is reminiscent of the bright
reﬂection nebulae that appeared when V1057 Cyg and V1647 Ori erupted, and we accept the
bright state of IC 430 around 1888 as evidence of a prior eruption, and accordingly classify
the object as a bona ﬁde FUor. Cieza et al. (2016) used ALMA observations to determine
a dynamical mass of 1.3±0.1 M⊙ for V883 Ori, and found evidence that the water-line was
moved outwards in the disk during the eruption, although Schoonenberg et al. (2017) oﬀer
a diﬀerent interpretation.

V2775 Orionis: The outburst of this object occurred between March 2007 and Novem-
ber 2008, with an increase in brightness of 3.8 magnitudes at K-band, as documented by
Caratti o Garatti et al. (2011). Their near-IR spectrum shows several of the features that
characterize FUor spectra: strong water and CO absorption, a ’triangular’ H-band contin-
uum, VO bands and no emission lines. Fischer et al.
(2012) observed He I absorption
blue-shifted by ∼ 300 kms−1. Whereas our spectrum also shows He I absorption, it is much
weaker and is centered at the rest wavelength. This object has only been detected at infrared

– 10 –

wavelengths, and we argue in Appendix A that this object is on the back side of its cloud.

FU Orionis: The eruption of FU Ori was observed in 1936 (Wachmann 1954, Herbig
1966). The light curve shows a rapid brightening by ∼5.5 magnitudes over 8 months, followed
by a slow decline of ∼1/2 magnitude over the next 40 years with small-scale faster variability
(Herbig 1977). Wang et al. (2004) noted a highly reddened faint companion 0.′′5 south of FU
Ori, which was demonstrated to be a young star by Reipurth & Aspin (2004a), and Beck &
Aspin (2012) and Pueyo et al. (2012) determined that this companion is the more massive
component of the FU Ori binary. FU Ori is the prototype of the FUors, and since it suﬀers
very little extinction we use its spectrum as the reference for all other potential FUors.

V900 Monocerotis: The outburst of this target was ﬁrst noticed in 2009 by Thommes
et al. (2011). Optical and IR spectra taken by Reipurth et al. (2012) conﬁrmed several FUor-
like spectral features. The object is a partly embedded Class I object with a considerable
extinction of about AV ∼13 magnitudes.
(2017)
suggests that the object is still brightening. Our spectrum of V900 Mon appears to be con-
sistent with the spectrum in Reipurth et al. (2012) and displays all the FUor characteristics
discussed in Sect. 3.1.

Infrared photometry by Varricatt et al.

V960 Monocerotis: This object is also known as 2MASS J06593158-0405277. It is a
recent FUor whose eruption was ﬁrst noticed on Nov 3, 2014 by Maehara et al. (2014). The
outburst happened between January and October 2014. Hackstein et al. (2015) presented
the light-curve for this target back to Nov 2010, showing the target getting brighter in the
R-band and I-band by ∼2.6 magnitudes. After the outburst was discovered, Hackstein et
al. (2015) found that the R-band brightness declined by ∼0.5 magnitudes in the following 6
months while showing a low-amplitude 17-day oscillation, which they interpreted as evidence
for a (unseen) companion. K´osp´al et al. (2015) found V960 Mon to be associated with 8
likely T Tauri stars and an embedded Class 0 source. Jurdana-Sepic & Munari (2016) found
no other eruptions in a historical light curve spanning from 1899 to 1989. Caratti o Garatti
et al. (2015) imaged a faint companion at a 0.′′2 separation, and possibly another even closer
companion. We observed it on Dec 22, 2014, very shortly after the eruption was announced,
when the object was at K=7.42, whereas the 2MASS magnitude is K=9.45. The spectrum
displays all the FUor characteristics.

V1515 Cygni: This object is located near the NGC 6914 region in Cygnus at an
approximate distance of 1050 pc according to Racine (1968). It was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a FUor
by Herbig (1977), and the FUor classiﬁcation was further supported by the observations
(1991). The light curve in Herbig (1977) shows a slow and
presented by Kenyon et al.
gradual brightening over ∼10 years, starting in about 1950, diﬀerent from the very rapid rise
of FU Orionis. Clarke et al. (2005) extend the light curve to 2003, showing a slow gradual

– 11 –

decline with ∼0.3 magnitudes of short-term variability. Optical spectra taken around 1974
show a high luminosity G type star, with P Cygni proﬁle at Hα, and strong lithium at 671
nm. The K-band spectrum presented by Reipurth & Aspin (1997) shows the strong CO
absorption characteristic of FUors. Our spectrum is discussed in Sect. 3.1.

HBC 722: Also known as V2493 Cygni. A faint visible star erupted in July 2010 and
brightened by R∼4.2 magnitudes in ∼2 months (Semkov et al. 2010, 2012). It is associated
with the small cluster around LkHα 188 that is located in the active star forming cloud
L935 in the North America Nebula at a distance of 550 pc (e.g., Armond et al. 2011).
Shortly after the outburst was noticed, the optical spectrum of this object was observed
to be similar to FUors (e.g., Munari et al. 2010).
Importantly, a pre-outburst optical
spectrum was fortuitously recorded and found to be consistent with a classical T Tauri star
showing hydrogen emission with a K7-M0 spectral type (Cohen & Kuhi 1979, Miller et al.
2011). Despite undergoing an outburst of accretion, the non-detection of this source in the
sub-millimeter by SMA puts an upper limit on the total circumstellar material at 0.02 M⊙
(Dunham et al. 2012). After the initial eruption, HBC 722 faded slightly, then brightened
to a relatively stable plateau (e.g., K´osp´al et al. 2016). Our spectrum displays all the FUor
characteristics discussed in Sect. 3.1.

V2494 Cygni: Also known as IRAS 20568+5217 and HH 381 IRS. The L1003 cloud
in Cygnus is a region of active star formation (e.g., Magakian et al. 2010) with numerous
HH objects, including HH 381 associated with IRAS 20568+5217 which illuminates a bright
reﬂection nebula (Devine et al. 1997, Connelley et al. 2007). Reipurth & Aspin (1997)
suggested the FUor nature of the object based on near-infrared spectra, a classiﬁcation
further supported by Greene et al. (2008) and Aspin et al. (2009b). The star brightened by
R∼2.5 magnitudes sometime between 1952 and 1983 after which it seems to have reached
a plateau (Magakian et al. 2013). The optical spectrum shows Hα and forbidden emission
lines originating from the HH 381 ﬂow near the star, which has a projected length on the
sky of 4.7 pc (Magakian et al. 2013, Khanzadyan et al. 2012). Our spectrum displays all
the FUor characteristics discussed in Sect. 3.1.

V1057 Cygni: The star, which lies in a dense cloud within the North America Nebula
(NGC 7000), brightened by 6 magnitudes in 1969 (Welin 1971a,b). A fortuitous pre-eruption
low resolution optical spectrum taken in 1957 shows an ”advanced T Tauri emission spec-
trum with no detectable absorption lines” (Herbig & Harlan 1971). The outbursting star
was studied in detail photometrically and spectroscopically by Herbig (1977). The light
curve from 1969 to 2012 has been compiled by Kopatskaya et al. (2013), who showed that
the rapid decline in brightness can be ﬁtted with an exponential curve. They also found
that the I-band photometry has a strong 523-day periodic variation with ∼0.5 mag ampli-

– 12 –

tude. V1057 Cyg has a high-velocity long-lasting wind which manifests itself through strong
blueshifted absorption troughs at several prominent optical lines (Herbig 2009). Hartmann
& Kenyon (1987) presented high resolution near-infrared spectra, which are consistent with
the disk accretion model for FUors. Most recently, Green et al. (2016) have detected a faint
companion to V1057 Cyg with a projected separation of 58 mas and a brightness diﬀerence
of ∆K∼3.3 mag. Our spectrum is discussed in Sect. 3.1.

V2495 Cygni: Also sometimes called the Braid Nebula Star. A bright near-infrared
reﬂection nebula appeared between 1999 and 2001, brightening at K-band by at least 4
magnitudes (Movsessian et al. 2006). Their near-IR spectrum shows many characteristics
of FUors (e.g.
’triangular’ H-band continuum, strong water and CO absorption), and is
essentially identical to the spectrum we show here. The source is associated with several
HH objects, HH 629/635, with a projected length on the sky of 0.8 pc (Magakian et al.
2010, Khanzadyan et al. 2012). The object is highly extincted, so our H-band spectrum is
noisy and the J-band spectrum is missing. The CO absorption is very deep and the H-band
continuum has a clear triangular shape.

V1735 Cygni: Also known as Elias 1-12, IRAS 21454+4718. and HBC 733. Elias
(1978) showed that this object, located in the dark molecular ﬁlaments stretching ∼2◦ west
of IC 5146, had brightened by at least 5 visual magnitudes between 1952 and 1965, and
identiﬁed it as a new FUor. Sandell & Weintraub (2001) found a bright submillimeter source,
V1735 Cyg SM1, about 24 arcsec northeast of V1735 Cyg. SM1 is almost coincident with
the IRAS source 21454+4718. Both sources were detected in X-rays with XMM-Newton
by Skinner et al.
(2009). Six out of seven of our spectra of this object are consistent
with the spectrum shown in Greene & Lada (1996), demonstrating that the object is quite
stable. However, one spectrum diﬀers, and this spectroscopic variability is further discussed
in Sect. 5.3. Our spectrum shows the FUor characteristics discussed in Sect. 3.1, with
exceptionally strong water vapor features.

V733 Cephei: Also known as Persson’s Star. The outburst of this object was ﬁrst
noticed in 2004 (Persson 2004). Peneva et al. (2010) found that the earliest photographic
plate showing the outburst was taken in 1971, and the object slowly rose in brightness until
1993. From 2007 to 2009, they observed this object to slowly fade. Optical and near-
IR spectra (Reipurth et al. 2007) show great similarity to FU Ori, securing this object’s
classiﬁcation as a FUor. Our spectrum of V773 Cep is consistent with the spectrum shown
in Reipurth et al. (2007).

4.2. FUor-like Objects

Wide-ﬁeld and all-sky surveys are becoming increasingly common, and as a result it is
more and more likely that a new FUor eruption will be quickly detected. Until recently,
however, this was not the case, and hence we can be certain that in the past many FUor
eruptions have been overlooked. Since some FUors retain their spectroscopic characteristics
for up to a century or even more (e.g., FU Ori 1936 eruption, V883 Ori <1888 eruption), we
expect to ﬁnd a number of objects that have all the FUor characteristics, but whose outbursts
were missed. A very similar situation exists for novae, for which the terms nova and nova-like
object have been introduced, depending on whether an eruption has been witnessed or not.
In analogy, Reipurth et al. (2002) suggested to use the nomenclature FUors and FUor-like
objects. In this section, we list 10 objects which have clear spectroscopic FUor characteristics,
but for which an eruption was missed. In Section 5 we compare the properties of bona ﬁde
FUors and the FUor-like objects. The de-reddened spectra of the FUor-like objects are
presented in Figure 6.

RNO 1c: This heavily extincted object is located ∼6 arcsec from the FUor RNO 1b
in the L1287 cloud. Unlike RNO 1b, however, no outburst has been observed. Based on a
2.291-2.298 µm spectrum, Kenyon et al. (1993) found that RNO 1c has the same deep CO
absorption characteristic as FUors and, combined with its energy distribution, suggested its
FUor nature. Our complete 1-4 µm spectrum mostly supports this conclusion. The spectrum
shows strong, distinct CO band heads, although the ’triangular’ H-band continuum resulting
from water absorption that is a characteristic of FUors is quite weak.

PP 13S: Also known as IRAS 04073+3800. PP 13 is a small compact reﬂection nebula
in the L1473 cloud in Perseus (Parsamian & Petrossian 1979). Cohen et al. (1983) found
the nebula to be associated with two sources, PP 13N, a typical T Tauri star, and PP 13S,
a cometary nebula with no Hα emission and illuminated by an embedded infrared source.
Further near-infrared imaging was presented by Smith (1993), who resolved PP 13N into
a close binary. Sandell & Aspin (1998) and Aspin & Sandell (2001) found PP 13S to be
driving a molecular outﬂow, and detected deep, broadened 2.3 µm CO absorption bands in
a 2.0-2.5 µm spectrum, and on this basis suggested that PP 13S could be in an elevated
FUor state. Aspin & Reipurth (2000) found a small Herbig-Haro jet, HH 463, emanating
from PP 13S along the axis of the molecular outﬂow. Perez et al. (2010) presented CARMA
0.′′15 resolution 227 GHz observations of the circumstellar disk of PP 13S. Since 1998, the
K-band magnitude has faded from 9.2 to 10.8. However, our data show that the spectrum
in the K-band is little changed from 1998. There is still weak H2 emission, presumably from
HH 463, and the CO band heads are indistinct. At ﬁrst glance the red featureless continuum
is unlike any bona ﬁde FUor, however, this is primarily due to the high extinction towards

– 14 –

the object. The water absorption bands that form the characteristic ’triangular’ shape of
the continuum become evident when the spectrum is dereddened by an AV of about 56 mag.

L1551 IRS 5: This is a deeply embedded object (Fridlund et al. 1980), that was
classiﬁed as a FUor on the basis of its optical spectrum seen via a reﬂection nebula (Mundt
et al. 1985, Stocke et al. 1988). The source is a binary with projected separation of 0.′′36
(Bieging & Cohen 1985, Lim et al. 2016), with each component driving a jet (Fridlund &
Liseau 1998, Rodr´ıguez et al. 2003). The near-infrared spectrum in Reipurth & Aspin (1997)
shows H2 emission and CO band absorption. Strong [FeII] emission seen in our spectrum
at 1.644 µm is unusual for FUors, but - as the H2 emission - it likely derives from the asso-
ciated jets. Greene et al. (2008) presented high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy, and
used cross-correlation with FU Ori to demonstrate their similarities: deep CO absorption,
triangular H-band continuum, and strong break at 1.33 µm.

Haro 5a IRS: This source, also known as IRAS 05329-0505, is one of the more luminous
embedded sources in Orion (e.g., Wolstencroft et al. 1986). Haro 5a and Haro 6a designate
the two lobes of an optically visible reﬂection nebula surrounding the IRAS source (Haro
1953). This is the source for the giant ﬂow HH 41, 42, 128, 129, 294, and 295 (Reipurth et
al. 1997a). The object was identiﬁed as a FUor-like object based on its near-IR spectrum
(Reipurth & Aspin 1997). Our spectrum shows an extremely red continuum with strong CO
absorption, and without photospheric absorption lines. The water absorption bands creating
the triangular shape in the H-band appears to be weakly present, but when dereddened by
an extinction of AV ∼57 mag, their presence become evident (see Figure 6).

IRAS 05450+0019: This is an embedded source also known as NGC 2071 MM3 which
illuminates a large bipolar reﬂection nebula in the NGC 2071 region at a distance of 400 pc
(Connelley et al. 2007).
It was identiﬁed as a FUor-like object by Connelley & Greene
(2010) based on its near-infrared spectrum, which shows very strong CO absorption and a
triangular continuum shape in the H-band. Our present spectrum is identical to the earlier
spectrum.

Z Canis Majoris: Herbig (1960) identiﬁed Z CMa as a young star, which he classiﬁed
as a HAeBe star. Later, Hartmann et al. (1989) suggested that Z CMa is a FUor on the
basis of weak CO absorption and doubled absorption lines from Li I and Ca I near 671 nm
which they interpret as originating from a rotating accretion disk. The star also displays the
wide blueshifted absorption troughs at the Hα and Sodium doublet characteristic of FUors
(e.g., Hessman et al. 1991, Welty et al. 1992). Both the HAeBe and the FUor classiﬁcation
turn out to be correct, since Z CMa has been found to be a 0.′′1 binary (e.g., Haas et al. 1993,
Velazquez & Rodr´ıguez 2001), where the SE component is a FUor and the NW component
is a Herbig Be star (e.g., Bonnefoy et al. 2016). Z CMa drives a giant HH ﬂow with a well

– 15 –

collimated jet (Poetzel et al. 1989). Whelan et al. (2010) demonstrated that this large-scale
jet is driven by the Herbig Be star, but that also the FUor drives a small ∼0.′′4 jet, see
also Antoniucci et al. (2016). Z CMa shows major optical variability, Covino et al. (1984)
collected the photometric history from 1923 to 1983, revealing an amplitude of 3 magnitudes,
but no outburst, implying that it must have occurred prior to 1923. This variability has been
traced to the Herbig Be component (e.g., Bonnefoy et al. 2016). Our near-infrared spectrum
shows little resemblance to a FUor spectrum, which evidently is due to the superposition of
the FUor spectrum with the (brighter) Herbig Be spectrum (both of which are separated in
the integral ﬁeld spectra of Bonnefoy et al. 2016). We note that the Brγ line is in emission
with broad blue and red shifted wings extending out to ± ∼1000 kms−1, whereas the He I
line only has a blue shifted absorption wing extending out to 1000 kms−1.

BBW 76: Also known as V646 Puppis. This object was identiﬁed as a FUor based on its
optical spectrum and near-IR photometry (Reipurth 1985b, Reipurth 1990). Photographic
plates from 1900 show it as bright as it is today (Reipurth et al. 2002), rather than the usual
slow decline observed from most FUors. Evans et al. (1994) did not detect a CO outﬂow at
346 GHz, and it is not associated with an HH object (Reipurth & Aspin 1997). Although
the optical line proﬁles changed in observations obtained over a period of 10 years starting
in 1985 (Reipurth et al. 2002), our spectrum of this target is consistent with the K-band
spectrum 20 years earlier presented in Reipurth & Aspin (1997).

Parsamian 21: Also known as IRAS 19266+0932. The object, which displays a promi-
nent reﬂection nebula (e.g., Connelley et al. 2007), was identiﬁed as a FUor by Staude &
Neckel (1992) based on its optical spectrum and spectral energy distribution. The optical
spectrum showed Hα absorption blueshifted by ∼600 kms−1, Li absorption, and an F5 giant
spectral type. The near-IR spectra presented by Greene et al.
(2008) and Connelley &
Greene (2010), as well as our spectrum shown here, show a remarkable similarity to FU Ori
and support the conclusion that this is a FUor-like object. The visible light brightness has
not appreciably changed for at least 57 years (Semkov & Peneva 2010). SED analysis (Gra-
majo et al. 2014) and near-IR polarimetry (K´osp´al et al. 2008) show that this target is
seen nearly edge-on. We do not see a far-side (southern) reﬂection nebula for Parsamian 21,
despite background stars being visible to the south. Parsamian 21 appears to be at the south-
ern edge of its cloud, so it is likely that there is simply no dust to the south of Parsamian
21 to scatter light.

CB 230 IRS1: Also known as IRAS 21169+6804 or CB230 A. This is a deeply em-
bedded Class 0/I protostar in the L1177 cloud. A companion, IRS2, is located ∼10′′ to the
east (e.g., Massi et al. 2008), corresponding to about 3000 AU at the 300 pc distance (e.g.,
Das et al. 2015). High-resolution VLA observations reveal another close companion at 0.′′3

– 16 –

separation, making it a triple system (Tobin et al. 2013). No outburst has been witnessed.
Massi et al. (2008) mention the possibility that some of the spectral features could be from
a circumstellar disk, as in a FUor, but do not classify this object as a FUor. Our spectrum
shows that the source shares prominent characteristics of FUors: strong CO absorption,
’triangular’ H-band continuum, and a dearth of photospheric metal lines. Hence, we classify
CB230 IRS1 as a new FUor-like object.

HH 354 IRS: Also known as IRAS 22051+5848 or L1165 SMM1. This is the source of a
giant HH outﬂow (Reipurth et al. 1997a) and it illuminates a reﬂection nebula visible in the
optical and near-IR (e.g., Connelley et al. 2007). HH 354 has a projected separation of 2.4 pc
from IRAS 22051+5848 at the ∼750 pc distance of the L1165 cloud (Reipurth et al. 1997a).
The source is an embedded Class 0/I protostar, and Reipurth & Aspin (1997) showed that
the K-band spectrum has a red featureless continuum and strong CO absorption, and noted
that the K-band spectrum is very similar to L1551 IRS5. No outburst has been detected.
The K-band brightness of this object has varied from K=13.3 in 1987 (Persi et al. 1988)
to K=9.7 in 1999 (2MASS) to K=10.8 in this paper. Additional near-infrared spectroscopy
supports the classiﬁcation as a FUor-like object (Greene et al. 2008, Connelley & Greene
2010), and the spectrum we present here is consistent with previous spectra. High-resolution
radio continuum VLA observations have revealed a 0.′′3 companion (Tobin et al. 2013).

4.3. Peculiar Objects with Some FUor Characteristics

A number of objects have been identiﬁed over the years as FUors, which either through
closer comparison with the spectra of the three classical FUors (Section 3) or through spectral
variability are no longer convincingly classiﬁable as FUors. In the following we comment on
8 such objects.

V1647 Orionis: The eruption of this object was discovered by the amateur astronomer
Ian McNeil, when a bright reﬂection nebula, now known as McNeil’s Nebula, appeared in
2004 in the Lynds 1630 cloud (McNeil et al. 2004, Brice˜no et al. 2004). Near-IR spectra,
taken shortly after the outburst was noticed, showed emission from the CO band heads near
2.3 µm, atomic H, Na I, Ca I, and Ca II, and strong absorption from He I at 1.083 µm,
water ice, and solid state CO at 4.6 µm (Reipurth & Aspin 2004b, Vacca et al. 2004). After
photometrically declining to pre-outburst brightness, V1647 Ori unexpectedly brightened
again in August 2008 to be as bright as it was in 2004. During this second brightening, the
near-IR spectrum was quite diﬀerent than during its 2004 eruption. The spectrum showed
strong water vapor absorption and ’triangular’ H-band continuum common among FUors,
Brγ emission, and possible CO band head absorption (Aspin et al. 2009a). The Harvard

– 17 –

plate collection reveals that this object previously erupted in 1966-67 (Aspin et al. 2006).
Our spectrum shows that atomic hydrogen and the CO bands are now back in emission, but
other than that the overall spectrum is remarkably FUor-like. However, the presence of CO
emission is such a major deviation from ’normal’ spectroscopic FUor appearance that we
do not include the object among the FUors. One possible, but unproved, explanation could
be that V1647 Ori is a close binary with a FUor plus an active companion that causes the
CO emission, a scenario reminiscent of Z CMa. Principe et al. (2017) mapped two distinct,
misaligned molecular outﬂows, but do not ﬁnd evidence for any companion at distances
larger than 40 AU. If a companion is responsible for the recent outburst, however, it would
still be close to periastron, and thus diﬃcult to detect.

IRAS 06297+1021W: This IRAS source, located in the NGC 2264 clouds, is resolved
at near-infrared wavelengths into two sources with a separation of 70′′ (Connelley et al.
2008a,b). A near-infrared spectrum of the western component was presented by Connelley
& Greene (2010), who noted certain spectroscopic features characteristic of FUors, but also
strong discrepancies. The continuum looks like a FUor, with a triangular H-band proﬁle and
He absorption. However, in common with V1647 Ori and Z CMa, it has CO in emission.
Also similar to Z CMa, this object shows emission from sodium (2.208 µm), Brγ, Paβ, and
the Ca IR triplet (0.85 µm).

AR 6a: Also known as V912 Mon. This is a bright near-infrared source in NGC 2264.
While an outburst has not been observed in this object, Aspin & Reipurth (2003) suggested,
based on a K-band spectrum showing strong CO and Brγ absorption, a FUor-nature for
AR 6a. However, our present spectrum, taken more than 10 years later, now shows only
weak CO absorption and the Br series in absorption, giving the appearance of a highly
reddened early type star. Notably there is no triangular shape of the continuum in the
H-band. Since 2003, the spectrum of this object has evidently changed and it is no longer
similar to a FUor.

AR 6b: This is a faint companion to AR 6a, at a separation of about 3′′. An outburst
has not been observed. The K-band spectrum of Aspin & Reipurth (2003) shows stronger
CO absorption and more IR excess than AR 6a. Aspin & Reipurth (2003) argue that this
should be classiﬁed as a FUor due to the CO absorption and overall spectroscopic similarity
to PP 13S. Our 1-2.5 µm spectrum shows high veiling, and possibly water absorption from
1.7 to 2 µm, but the spectrum is too noisy to make deﬁnite statements on the presence
of water. The individual CO bands are not distinct, possibly due to high rotation. The
spectrum is certainly not one typical of T Tauri stars, and a FUor-like classiﬁcation is still
possible, but we feel it safer to withhold judgment until better data are in hand.

IRAS 06393+0913: Connelley & Greene (2010) obtained a SpeX near-infrared spec-

– 18 –

trum of this object in NGC 2264, and noted certain similarities to FUors, especially the
very deep CO band head absorption, but due to the lack of any water absorption creating
the triangular continuum shape in the H-band they stepped back from classifying the object
as a FUor-like object. Moreover, as discussed in Section 7, the luminosity of this object is
as low as 0.9 L⊙, which opens the question whether it might be a young brown dwarf, see
Section 6.

V346 Normae: Also known as HH 57 IRS. The eruption was discovered in 1983 and
the star is visible on plates taken as early as 1980 (Graham & Frogel 1985, Reipurth 1985a).
Optical spectra taken at that time showed Hα absorption blue-shifted by ∼440 kms−1 and
Li absorption. V346 Nor drives the little HH ﬂow HH 57 (Prusti et al. 1993, Reipurth et al.
1997b). ´Abrah´am et al. (2004) compiled the light curve up to that time, and most recently
Kraus et al. (2016) and K´osp´al et al. (2017) noted that V346 Nor had declined signiﬁcantly
in brightness by 2010, indicating a drop in accretion rate by three orders of magnitude,
followed by another brightening. Our spectrum is taken in July 2015 during this second
brightening, but with the source still about 4 magnitudes fainter than during its previous
outburst. It has been assumed up to now that V346 Nor is a bona ﬁde FUor, mainly because
of its brightening during the early 1980’s, but also due to its strong P Cyg proﬁle at Hα (e.g.,
Graham & Frogel 1985). However, our spectrum as well as one by Graham & Frogel (1985)
show virtually no CO absorption, while another spectrum from the mid-1990’s (Reipurth et
al. 1997b) shows pronounced CO emission and Brγ emission (which also has disappeared
again). Moreover, H2 emission is now present in the spectrum. The unusual light curve and
the spectroscopic variability makes V346 Nor more similar to V1647 Ori, and we similarly
consider it to belong to the group of peculiar stars with some FUor characteristics. We
speculate that also V346 Nor could be a binary with a FUor and an active companion, as
the FUor-like object Z CMa.

IRAS 18270-0153W: This object was identiﬁed as a possible FUor-like object by
Connelley & Greene (2010), showing a ’triangular’ H-band continuum, strong CO absorption,
and no photospheric absorption lines, with an appearance similar to other FUor-like objects.
However, our more recent spectrum, although rather noisy, no longer looks like a FUor,
showing weaker CO absorption and a smoother H-band continuum.

V371 Serpentis: Originally listed as EC 53 by Eiroa & Casali (1992), who noted a
small cometary nebula in their infrared imaging survey of the Serpens core. Hodapp (1999)
found the nebula to be variable, and Hodapp et al. (2012) determined a period of 543 days
with an amplitude of ∆K∼2 mag, possibly due to a very close companion, and also noted
that the source has a resolved 0.′′3 companion. The high resolution spectra from Doppmann
et al. (2005) of three segments in the K-band are consistent with our spectrum, which shows

– 19 –

CO absorption, triangular H-band continuum, and a dearth of identiﬁable photospheric
absorption lines. Several emission lines of [FeII] and H2 are seen which we ascribe to shocks
in a small jet. The object is extremely red, so the H-band spectrum is noisy, and the J-band
spectrum is absent despite 4 hours of integration. It is conceivable that V371 Ser could be
a FUor-like object, but the data are not good enough to conﬁrm that. Moreover, as we
discuss in Section 7, there is the concern that V371 Ser has a luminosity of only 1.6 L⊙,
which should be divided between two or possibly three components. In Section 6 we discuss
the possibility that V371 Ori is a newly born brown dwarf.

IRAS 18341-0113S: Similar to the previous object, this one was also identiﬁed as
a possible FUor-like object by Connelley & Greene (2010), showing a ’triangular’ H-band
continuum, strong break in the continuum slope at 2.3 µm, but barely detectable CO ab-
sorption. Our new spectrum, however, no longer looks like a FUor, showing no appreciable
CO absorption and a smoother red H-band continuum. We therefore include also this ob-
ject in the category of peculiar objects with some FUor characteristics. We also note that
IRAS 18341-0113S has a very low luminosity of only 0.8 L⊙, in fact it is the lowest luminosity
object of all our 33 targets, and in Section 6 we discuss the possibility that it may be a very
young brown dwarf.

4.4. Spectral Variability of the Bona Fide FUors

FUors are much less spectroscopically variable than other YSOs, and their spectra
maintain their FUor characteristics decades after the eruption. The only major spectroscopic
change seen in a bona ﬁde FUor is the strong weakening of the CO band in V1057 Cyg, which
has accompanied its signiﬁcant fading (Section 3.1). Connelley & Greene (2014) monitored
two FUors (V1735 Cyg and V2494 Cyg, each observed 5 times) among 19 YSOs. The He I
line at 1.08 µm (one of the few strong lines in a FUor spectrum) varied on average by 18%
for the two monitored FUors, with a maximum variability of just under 60%. However, this
line varied on average by 57% for the other YSOs, with a maximum variability of a factor of
12. In the course of this survey, 11 of the 33 targets were observed more than once in SXD
mode. V1735 Cyg was the only target to show a signiﬁcant change in this time.

Combining the data in Connelley & Greene (2014) with our new data, V1735 Cyg has
been monitored with SpeX eight times over the past nine years. The spectrum showed little
change (other than slight changes in the He I line proﬁle) until July 8, 2016. The spectrum
taken on that night was signiﬁcantly redder (Figure 7), and the He I line showed a P Cygni
proﬁle for the ﬁrst time (Figure 8). The additional ﬂux appears to be a featureless red
continuum, but with added CO absorption. The change in the CO and He I lines shows

that this was not a simple data processing error, or a change in the line-of-sight extinction.
Before this event, the He I line showed blueshifted emission with a maximum velocity of
–500 kms−1 to –800 kms−1. This event accelerated the wind velocity up to –950 kms−1. An
observation taken the following month shows that V1735 Cyg had returned to its previous
state. The He I and CO lines, as well as the continuum, were again consistent with previous
spectra.

Despite the obvious spectroscopic changes during this unusual event, the K-band bright-
ness of V1735 Cygni appears to have changed very little, if at all. The K-band ﬂux on July
8, 2016 is consistent with our photometry from Aug 28, 2015, a year before this event. On
the month after the event, the photometry on Aug 20, 2016 is only 0.2 magnitudes fainter
than on July 8, 2016. Considering the very slight photometric change, it is unlikely that this
event represents a new outburst or signiﬁcant change in the state of this FUor. We seem to
have caught a rare, isolated, and transient event that demonstrates that FUors can exhibit
signiﬁcant spectroscopic variability without much photometric variability.

5. FUors as Low-Gravity Objects

Figure 9 shows a comparison of the equivalent widths of the bluest CO band (measured
from 2.292 to 2.320 µm) versus the sodium plus calcium lines of FUors, of some Class I
sources, and of late ﬁeld dwarfs, giants, and supergiants. It is readily seen that this diagram
eﬀectively diﬀerentiates FUors and FUor-like objects from the Class I sources. This diagnos-
tic diagram has also been used by Greene & Lada (1996) and later by Connelley & Greene
(2010). The Na (2.208 µm) and Ca (2.265 µm) lines were used, as they are near the CO
band heads so they are all equally aﬀected by veiling and extinction. In this ﬁgure, adding
veiling tends to push a star closer to (0,0). Both bona ﬁde FUors and FUor-like objects
mostly lie in a tight group near the giant stars (and along the veiling vector from the super
giants) in Figure 9. This is consistent with the interpretation of FUors being low gravity
objects. If we let m be the average equivalent width of the Na + Ca lines, then to be on the
FUor side of the ﬁgure the CO equivalent width should be greater than 3m+5 (shown by
the gray dashed line). We note that the peculiar objects tend to mostly be located closer to
(0,0) in a group separate from the majority of the bona ﬁde FUors and FUor-like objects.

The separation into two distinct groups of FUors plus FUor-like objects vs. peculiar
objects is broken by four of the 33 objects in Figure 10, and we discuss these four objects in
the following:

1) The only bona ﬁde FUor that clusters with the peculiar objects is V1057 Cyg. This

– 21 –

is unexpected and somewhat disturbing, since V1057 Cyg is one of the classical FUors which
helped to deﬁne FUors as a class. As discussed in Section 3.1, V1057 Cyg has undergone
a signiﬁcant evolution in luminosity, with a concomitant major decrease in its CO band
strength, which accounts for its location further left in Figure 10 than any other FUor or
FUor-like object. We note that Calvet et al. (1991) show (their Fig.5) that CO absorption
is only dominant in the outer annuli of the circumstellar disk. Hence as the disk cools and
fades, the outer annuli may become undetectable. Or if the outer annuli are not continuously
replenished from an envelope, they will spiral inwards. The explanation for its weaker
sodium and calcium lines is even less clear, we speculate that hot spots due to accretion onto
the stellar surface begins to dominate as the disk emission fades, thus increasing veiling.
Whatever the speciﬁc reason, we believe that the location of V1057 Cyg outside the clump
of FUors and FUor-like objects in Figure 10 is due to the recent rapid decay from its high
FUor state.

2) The FUor-like object V371 Ser is also located among the peculiar objects and is close
to V1057 Cyg in the diagram. The object is deeply embedded and is only seen as a reﬂection
nebula, even at near-infrared wavelengths. This is in itself unlikely to be the cause of its
location among the peculiar objects, since seven other objects are also so embedded that
they are only seen as compact reﬂection nebulae. We have no explanation for the location
of V371 Ser in the diagram.

3) Z CMa is located in the extreme lower left corner of Figure 10, but this is readily
understood, since the object is a close binary combining a FUor and a Herbig Ae/Be star,
where the latter dominates the light in the near-infrared.

4) IRAS 06393+0913 is located in the middle of the group of FUors and FUor-like objects
in Figure 10. This is perhaps not surprising, since its main deviation from a FUor spectrum
is the absence of broad water bands and those would not aﬀect the line measurements used
for the diagram.

Figure 3 shows that all of the bona ﬁde FUors have a ’triangular’ H-band continuum
proﬁle. As stated by Barman et al. (2011), the absorption bands of water naturally meet
in the middle of the H-band, shaping the continuum into the well known triangular proﬁle.
As gravity increases, collisionally induced absorption (CIA) from H2 increases, and CIA
can be the dominant source of opacity at the higher gravity of dwarf stars (Borysow et al.
1997). CIA has a very broad wavelength dependence, eﬀectively smoothing out the otherwise
triangular proﬁle into the more rounded proﬁle seen in late type dwarfs. The ubiquity of
a triangular H-band proﬁle among bona ﬁde FUors is further evidence in support of FUors
being very low gravity objects.

6. Brown Dwarfs as FUor Impostors

Here we address the question of whether there are other objects in star forming regions
that may mimic the spectra of FUors. Broadly speaking, FUors in the near-infrared have
mid- to late-type M-spectra. The only other objects found in star forming regions with
such spectra are young brown dwarfs. At an age of 1 Myr, the brown dwarf mass limit
corresponds to a spectral type around M5.5. Figure 12 shows the near-infrared spectrum of
FU Ori together with that of HBC 341 (Dahm & Hillenbrand 2017), a partly embedded M5
star bordering the brown dwarf regime with an age assumed to be roughly 1 Myr, and that
of TWA-8B (Allers & Liu 2013), a brown dwarf in the 10-Myr old TWA association.

The similarity of the spectra is striking, and perhaps even surprising, given that the FUor
spectrum is emitted by a disk, while the BD spectra presumably comes from a photosphere.
The spectra are very similar even in most details, but there are a few diﬀerences. The ﬁrst
thing to notice is that the BD spectra show somewhat weaker CO bands, however, when a
larger sample of young BDs and FUors are compared, the two distributions of CO strength
do have some overlap, which makes it unusable as a criterion for distinction.

Paschen-α is very pronounced in FU Ori, and much weaker in HBC 341, but its location
in a region of limited atmospheric transmission makes it a poor criterion. Paschen-β, how-
ever, is better placed, and shows much higher strength compared to BDs. Figure 13 shows
a histogram of equivalent widths of Paschen-β for the FUors and FUor-like objects vs a
number of young BDs in the TW Hya association. In this ﬁgure, the number of objects at a
given EW is the sum of the objects whose EW range of uncertainty included that EW value.
These EW distributions just overlap due to a single FUor-like object, BBW 76. Z CMa
shows strong emission at the Paschen-β line, and is oﬀ to the far left in the ﬁgure.

A set of weaker lines in the J-band also show certain diﬀerences. The Na doublet at
1.138/1.141 is pronounced in BDs, but is absent in FU Ori. Other doublets of potassium
(1.169/1.178 and 1.243/1.253) and aluminum (1.313/1.315) are stronger in BDs than in
FU Ori, as are some iron lines (1.169/1.177/1.189/1.198). However, the fact that many
FUors are highly extincted makes the J-band often diﬃcult to observe.

In summary, for a purely spectroscopic classiﬁcation, the Paschen-β strength is the best,

although not completely unique, way to distinguish between a FUor and a BD.

In this context, two interesting questions arise: can brown dwarfs undergo FUor erup-
tions? And if so, how can we distinguish between a substellar object with and without major
accretion?

Regarding the ﬁrst question, we note that brown dwarfs are formed like stars, except

– 23 –

that they fail to reach the hydrogen-burning limit because either their mass reservoirs are
not large enough (Padoan & Nordlund 2004) or they are prematurely expelled from their
cloud core by companions (Reipurth & Clarke 2001) or their mass reservoir is destroyed by
a nearby massive star (Whitworth & Zinnecker 2004). All three mechanisms are likely to
operate, although identifying which mechanism is responsible for a given object is most likely
not possible. The key is that in all three cases there is a smooth transition of properties
across the stellar/substellar limit. We know that stars with a mass as low as an early M-type
star can erupt as a FUor (Reipurth, in prep.), so there seems little reason why a slightly
less massive brown dwarf also cannot undergo a FUor outburst. Additionally, we know that
brown dwarfs have circumstellar disks, albeit smaller than those of higher-mass T Tauri
stars (e.g. Testi et al. 2016). We conclude that there is no obvious reason why brown
dwarfs should not undergo FUor eruptions like their higher-mass brethren, although they
may perhaps not reach as high luminosities.

Regarding the second question, as we have shown above, the photospheric spectra of
brown dwarfs and the disk spectra of FUors are almost indistinguishable at the resolution
employed here. Future higher resolution spectroscopy may be key to separate the two types of
objects, e.g. by looking for the double-lined proﬁles characteristic of rotating disks in FUors
(e.g., Hartmann & Kenyon 1996). Meanwhile it appears that luminosity is a necessary pa-
rameter to separate brown dwarfs from brown dwarfs undergoing FUor outbursts. However,
setting a limit in luminosity between brown dwarfs and brown dwarfs in a FUor state may
not be straightforward, since young brown dwarfs are likely to experience a continuum in
accretion luminosity.

In Section 7 we determine the luminosities of all 33 objects of this study. The three
lowest-luminosity objects are IRAS 06393+0913 (0.9 L⊙), V371 Ser (1.6 L⊙), and IRAS
18341-0113S (0.8 L⊙). We have classiﬁed all three as peculiar, and they are individually
described in Section 4.3. With such low luminosities, and their spectra having some features
reminiscent of FUors, these spectra may be from a photosphere of a very low mass object
with at most a modest contribution from accretion.

7. Bolometric Luminosity Distribution

We now discuss the bolometric luminosities of FUors, and to that end their distances are
important. The distances we use are listed in Table 2 together with references to the distance
determinations. Although a few FUors have well determined distances, generally they are
not well known, and in some cases are little more than wishful thinking. We have critically
reviewed each distance, taking into account the many new accurate distance determinations

– 24 –

of star forming regions in recent years. See Appendix B for a discussion on the adopted
distance to each star forming region.

We have estimated the bolometric luminosity for each target using the distances listed
In an attempt to make a homogeneous set of luminosity estimates, we used
in Table 2.
publicly available photometry from 2MASS (JHK), WISE (3.4 to 22 µm), and Akari (65 to
160 µm). For the longer wavelengths of the spectral energy distributions (SED), we appended
a 20 K blackbody for each object, scaling the blackbody curve to match the Akari 160 µm
photometry. The 20 K temperature was chosen as that temperature provides a smooth
transition from the measured SED to the extrapolated blackbody. The 20 K blackbody ’tail’
on average adds 9% to the bolometric luminosity of the objects. We have not attempted to
correct the photometry for extinction.

The bolometric luminosity distribution is shown in Figure 14. FUors are shown in red,
FUor-like objects in The median bolometric luminosity for bona ﬁde FUors is 99 L⊙ and
for FUor-like objects it is 35 L⊙. If taken at face value, the smaller value for the FUor-like
objects could be understood under the assumption that FUors decline in brightness, and
that the eruptions of some FUor-like objects may have taken place long ago, before the
sky was well patrolled. However, a 2-sample K-S test shows that the bolometric luminosity
distributions cannot be diﬀerentiated at the 90% conﬁdence level, and we thus cannot show
that these two distributions are statistically diﬀerent.

We note that, despite being a spectroscopically rather homogenous group, FUors and
FUor-like objects span a wide range of bolometric luminosities. Their luminosities span 3
orders of magnitude, from ≈ 6 L⊙ to ≈ 3500 L⊙. It has been widely assumed that FUors
have considerable luminosities, but evidently some objects have luminosities that are only
slightly brighter than typically found for classical T Tauri stars, despite their dramatically
diﬀerent spectra.

8. Conclusions

We have conducted a homogeneous near-IR spectroscopic survey of all currently known
FUor and FUor-like YSOs as well as some peculiar objects with certain FUor characteristics,
in total 33 objects with varying degrees of evidence that they are indeed FUors. Our goal
was to decide the nature of these objects by more stringent means. We have obtained the
following results:

1. First we have determined the near-infrared spectroscopic characteristics of the three
classical FUors FU Ori, V1057 Cyg, and V1515 Cyg in order to establish a set of reference

– 25 –

criteria. The main near-infrared spectral characteristics of these objects is deep CO band
absorption, weak metal absorption lines, pronounced water vapor at the short and long sides
of the H-band window giving rise to a characteristic triangular H-band continuum, a strong
break at 1.32 µm due to water vapor, strong He I absorption (frequently blueshifted) at
1.083 µm, and few if any emission lines.

2. We then applied these criteria to the 33 objects, and divided them into three cat-
egories: bona ﬁde FUors (objects that display the above characteristics and for which an
eruption was observed), FUor-like objects (which display the above characteristics but for
which an eruption was not witnessed), and peculiar objects which either miss some FUor
characteristics or display additional unusual features.

3. We examined multiple spectra of three FUors (V1057 Cyg, V1735 Cyg, and V2494 Cyg).

V1057 Cyg has in recent years seen a signiﬁcant weakening of the CO bands, possibly re-
lated to a steep fading in brightness. Of the eight spectra of V1735 Cyg obtained over the
past 9 years, only one deviates from an otherwise stable appearance, one night showing an
additional red continuum and stronger CO band absorption, with no signiﬁcant change in
brightness. V2494 Cyg showed no spectral variability.

4. We have plotted the equivalent widths of the ∼2.2 µm lines of Na and Ca versus the
equivalent width of CO for all observed objects. FUors and FUor-like objects do not fall in
the same area as Class I sources, but are found together with giant and supergiant stars,
supporting other evidence that FUors are low-gravity objects. With only a few exceptions,
the FUors and FUor-like objects are located together in a group, whereas the peculiar objects
are mostly displaced to another nearby region of the diagram.

5. Whereas the ﬁrst FUors to be discovered were bright optically visible stars,
in
recent years an increasing number of FUors are found that are embedded. Extinction is
therefore an important parameter in the study of FUors, and we have estimated the amount
of extinction for all FUors and FUor-like objects. We assume that any spectral diﬀerences
between FUors are dominated by extinction rather than spectral diﬀerences and/or veiling.
We then matched the slope of all FUors and FUor-like objects to FU Orionis, which has
a low extinction of AV ∼1.5±0.2. Many of the objects were also observed in the L-band,
and often show a pronounced 3 µm ice band. By measuring the depth of the ice band and
comparing to the estimated extinction we have calibrated the relationship between the ice
band optical depth τ and the visual extinction: τ = 0.048 ∗ AV − 0.13.

6. Most FUors display reﬂection nebulae, and we provide an atlas of K-band images of
the surroundings of all of the objects studied. We note that three objects have no optical
counterpart and yet do not have pronounced reﬂection nebulae at K-band. We speculate

– 26 –

that these objects may not be deeply embedded, but merely located on or just beyond the
back side of their clouds.

7. The near-infrared spectra of FUors and the more massive brown dwarfs display great
similarity, and at low resolution can be indistinguishable. Close examination of their spectra
show some discrepancies. Paschen-α is very pronounced in FU Ori, but is located in a
region with poor atmospheric transmission. Paschen-β on the other hand is much stronger
in FUors than in brown dwarfs, where it is often absent. Certain weak metallic lines in
brown dwarfs are much stronger than in FUors, but both Paschen-β and these lines are in
the J-band, which makes them hard to detect in highly extincted objects. It is likely that
also brown dwarfs can undergo FUor eruptions, and this may add to the confusion between
brown dwarfs and FUors.

8. We have estimated the bolometric luminosity for each target using a homogeneous
data set consisting of photometry from 2MASS (JHK), WISE (3.4 to 22 µm), and Akari (65
to 160 µm), and from the 160 µm data point we appended a 20 K blackbody. In view of the
major improvement in distances to star forming regions in recent years, we review for each
object its most accurate distance. The median bolometric luminosity for bona ﬁde FUors is
99 L⊙ and 35 L⊙ for the FUor-like objects. Given that FUors decline with time and that
FUor eruptions are more likely to be witnessed today than at earlier times, the diﬀerence
is not unexpected. However, a 2-sample K-S test shows that the distributions cannot be
distinguished at the 90% level.

9. We have conﬁrmed two new FUor-like objects, V371 Ser and CB230 IRS1, that
initially attracted attention due to their bright near-infrared cometary reﬂection nebulae.
We classify V1647 Ori, frequently considered a FUor, as a peculiar object with some FUor
characteristics since its spectrum diﬀers signiﬁcantly from that of FUors. We speculate that
the object is a close binary with one component being a FUor and the other being responsible
for the emission line spectrum. Similarly, V346 Nor has long been classiﬁed as a FUor, but its
unusual light curve, its almost complete lack of CO absorption and presence of emission lines
points to a peculiar nature, possibly another case of a close binary. Finally both AR6a/6b
are deemed peculiar, in the case of AR6a because its spectrum has changed and is no longer
FUor-like.

A. Extinction and Reﬂection Nebulae

FUors are generally associated with interstellar material, and especially among the more
recently discovered ones there are a number of embedded cases. It is of interest to estimate
the amount of extinction that each FUor suﬀers along our line of sight, and we use our
spectral library to make such an attempt. As can be seen from Figure 3, FUor spectra
have fundamental similarities. On the assumption that their diﬀerence in spectral slope
is dominated by extinction rather than intrinsic spectral diﬀerences, we have determined
the amount of extinction that must be added to the spectrum of FU Ori to make the best
ﬁt to the observed spectra of the other 32 objects studied here. We adapted the spectral
ﬁtting code used by Connelley & Greene (2010), using FU Ori as the reference star, and only
considering extinction and not adding any veiling. This code adds extinction to the spectrum
of FU Ori in an eﬀort to minimize the RMS error between that model and the spectrum of
the FUor in question. The estimated uncertainty in the extinction is the amount of change
in extinction required to double the RMS ﬁtting error between the FUor in question and the
extincted spectrum of FU Ori.

Herbig (1977) concluded that FU Orionis has very little extinction, and Hartmann &
Kenyon (1985) and Kenyon et al.
(1988) suggested an AV of 1.55 and 2.2, respectively,
by comparison with disk models. More recently, Zhu et al. (2007) determined an AV of
1.5±0.2 from a detailed comparison of observations with models, a value which we adopt here.
Table 2 lists the derived extinctions for each object after adding FU Ori’s 1.5 magnitudes of
extinction, and Figures 3 and 6 show the dereddened spectra. Two comments are pertinent:
(1) Most of the objects in this study have a rather strong spectral similarity to FU Ori,
thus giving some conﬁdence in the estimated extinction values, but evidently the more
discrepancies to FU Ori that a spectrum shows, the more uncertain the value becomes;
(2) the extinction estimates refer to the light that reaches us, which may not always be
dominantly from the source itself, but could be from reﬂected light that escapes through a
cavity in those cases where the source is deeply embedded. Thus, the listed extinctions may
be lower limits.

In order to evaluate whether we see a FUor directly, or we observe a compact reﬂection
nebula, we have examined the K-band images that were obtained at the same time as each
spectrum; Table 2 lists the corresponding K-magnitudes. Figure 11 shows panels with these
K-band images. It is immediately clear that not all objects have stellar point spread func-
tions. The following eight sources are not seen directly even in the K-band, but are compact
reﬂection nebulae: L1551 IRS5, Haro 5a IRS, IRAS 05450+0019, V371 Ser, Parsamian 21,
V2495 Cyg, CB 230 IRS1, and HH 354 IRS. All of these, with the puzzling exception of
Parsamian 21, are among the objects with highest extinctions, which demonstrates that the

– 29 –

path of light from each source passes copious amount of dust.

It is well known that FUors in optical light are surrounded by often prominent reﬂection
nebulae (e.g., Herbig 1977, Goodrich 1987). Indeed, CB230 IRS1 and V371 Ser were ini-
tially suspected of being FUor-like on account of their nebula morphology alone; their true
nature was conﬁrmed by subsequent spectroscopy. The reﬂection nebulae on larger scales
are obviously more pronounced at short wavelengths, but these near-infrared images oﬀer
insight into the immediate surroundings of the objects. We note that ten objects do not
show evidence for reﬂection nebulae in the K-band, these are: V883 Ori, V2775 Ori, FU Ori,
IRAS 06297+1021W, IRAS 06393+0913, Z CMa, BBW 76, V1515 Cyg, V1735 Cyg, and
V733 Cep. All of these objects are among the ones with lowest extinctions, although in
three cases it is not negligible. The remainder show various degrees of reﬂection nebulosity.
In eight cases we clearly see cometary nebulae with the source embedded at the apex, indi-
cating that it is illuminating an outﬂow cavity. Perhaps not surprisingly, those eight are the
same sources listed above that are not seen directly.

Only three sources do not show any sign in the visible of either a star or a reﬂection
nebula. This is evidence of how the detection of FUors until recently has been primarily
done in the optical. Since all of the sources are associated with dark clouds, it follows that
almost all of these objects are located on the side of the clouds facing towards the observer.
We note that all optically visible FUors and FUor-like objects are associated with an optical
reﬂection nebula. A roughly equal number of objects should be located on the far side of dark
clouds. Three sources without any optical counterpart, V2775 Ori, IRAS 06297+1021W, and
IRAS 06393+0913, do not show evidence of reﬂection nebulae, suggesting that they are not
deeply embedded, and these three objects may thus be part of the missing population of
FUors that are located near the backside of clouds (we note that a weak reﬂection nebula
around V2775 Ori was detected in an HST image, see Fig. 2 of Fischer et al. 2012).

Our extinction estimates along with our 2 to 4 µm spectra allow us to calibrate the
relationship between the 3.0 µm ice band depth and the visual extinction for our sample of
YSOs. The relationship between the depth of the 3.0 µm ice band and extinction is well
established. Beck et al. (2001) showed that the 3.0 µm absorption is much greater towards
T Tau S than T Tau N, consistent with T Tau S being seen through greater extinction.
Beck (2007) ﬁt an ice absorption model to 2 to 4 µm spectra of several YSOs. However, she
considered the applicability of the relation between ice column density and visual extinction
to be questionable. Chiar et al. (2011) clearly showed a linear trend between 3.0 µm ice
band depth and the visual extinction through a quiescent dark cloud.

We adopted an empirical approach towards calibrating the relationship between the
3.0 µm ice band depth and the visual extinction. We measured the continuum ﬂux at

– 30 –

2.50, 3.05, and 3.80 µm over a bandwidth of 0.05 µm. We ﬁt a line between the 2.50 and
3.80 µm ﬂux levels, and calculated the interpolated 3.05 µm continuum level (Figure 15).
The relationship between Av (derived by comparison to FU Ori) and the ice band depth
is shown in Figure 16. For this ﬁgure, we used all of the FUors and FUor-like objects for
which we have 2 to 4 µm spectra except for Z CMa, since its continuum is so unlike other
FUor-like objects. The data in red are objects aﬀected by reﬂection nebulae in the near-
IR. Most of the very highly extincted objects have reﬂection nebulae, and are aﬀected by
scattered light. The depth of the ice band appears to saturate near τ ≈ 2, corresponding
to a visual extinction of about 30. Despite having sources seen through higher extinction,
the ice band depth does not appreciably deepen for these highly extincted objects. We ﬁt
a linear regression line through the data of all but the two highest extinction objects, for
which the ice band optical depth appears to have saturated. We derive the following the
relationship:

τ = (0.048 ± 0.008) ∗ AV − (0.13 ± 0.14)

(A1)

where τ is the ice band optical depth and AV is the visual extinction in magnitudes. τ

was calculated as –ln(ﬂux at 3 µm/continuum at 3 µm)

This method of calculating the ice band optical depth does not go to zero at zero
extinction, due to a natural curvature in the spectrum of a FUor at this wavelength range.
This curvature of the continuum is also seen among late M-giants in the SpeX library. To
compensate for this eﬀect, we subtracted the τ of FU Ori (likely the lowest extinction target)
from all of the sources, and this is reﬂected in the equation above. Some objects strongly
deviate from this relationship, such as Parsamian 21, which is a low extinction object (the
reﬂection nebula is seen in visible light) but has a strong ice band absorption feature. In
this case, a large fraction of the light from Parsamian 21 may be scattered, and the true
extinction to the source may be much higher.

B. Comments on Adopted Distances

L1287. The two sources RNO 1b/c are found in Cassiopeia and are associated with
the L1287 cloud located in the Orion arm of our Galaxy (Kun 2008). These sources are
commonly assumed to be at the kinematic distance of 800 pc (Persi et al. 1988). However,
recently Reid et al. (2014) used the VLBI to measure the parallax of a maser source in the
L1287 cloud, and determined a distance of 930±35 pc, which we henceforth use.

The California Molecular Cloud. The FUor-like object PP13S is located in a dense

– 31 –

core named L1473 within the giant California Molecular Cloud. A variety of distances have
been determined for diﬀerent components of the California Molecular Cloud, the most recent
is the extinction-based study by Lada et al. (2009) suggesting a distance of 450±23 pc, which
we adopt here.

L1551. The small cloud L1551 in Taurus is located just south of the large Taurus
cloud complex. Only three degrees from L1551 and also south of the Taurus complex is a
similar small cloud containing the eponymous T Tauri. For T Tauri a VLBA distance of
146.7±0.6 pc has been determined by Loinard et al. 2007, and we here assume the same
distance for L1551, but adopt a greater uncertainty, 147±5 pc.

Orion. The structure of the large Orion complex of star forming regions is increasingly
well understood, see Bally (2008) for a review. Recently Kounkel et al. (2017) observed 36
YSOs with the Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA) and determined a distance to the Orion
Nebula Cluster of 388±5 pc (in excellent correspondence with the earlier, less accurate
measurements of Jeﬀries 2007, Sandstrom et al. 2007 and Mayne & Naylor 2008) and found
that the L1641 (Orion A) cloud is inclined away from us, with a distance of 428±10 pc
towards its southern portion, while similarly the L1630 (Orion B) cloud is increasingly distant
towards the north, with NGC 2068 at 388±10 pc and NGC 2024 at roughly ∼420 pc.
Consequently we adopt 428 pc for V2775 Ori, which is located in the southern part of
L1641, and 388 pc for V883 Ori which is located in the northern part of L1641 near the
ONC. For Haro 5a IRS in OMC 2 we also adopt the ONC distance of 388 pc, and the same
for V1647 Ori just south of NGC 2068 and for IRAS 05450+0019 in NGC 2071 just north
of NGC 2068. Due to plasma radio scattering in the λ Ori region, Kounkel et al. were not
able to measure sources in that region, hence for FU Ori the best distance estimate remains
the 400±40 pc of Murdin & Penston (1977). FU Ori was measured by Gaia, but the First-
Release value of 353+82
−56 pc is still not a signiﬁcant improvement, so for now we remain with
the 400 pc value.

NGC 2264. Four of the objects in this study are located towards NGC 2264, these
are IRAS 06297+1021W, IRAS 06393+0913, and AR6a/b. Hence we re-examine the current
status of distance estimates to this region. NGC 2264 is often assumed to be at a distance of
about 800 pc, although various determinations range from 700 pc to 950 pc, see Table 1 in
Dahm (2008) for a full summary. Subsequent distance determinations of the cluster are by
Baxter et al. (2009), who suggest 913±40 pc based on model ﬁts to the rotational velocity
distribution, Turner (2012) who suggests 777±12 pc based on main sequence ﬁtting to 13
B-type stars, and Kamezaki et al. (2014), who ﬁnd 738 +57
−50 pc based on VLBI parallax
measurements of two water maser sources. Reviewing these values and their uncertainties,
we deem that the 738 pc distance for now remains the best value for NGC 2264.

Monoceros. The two FUors V900 Mon and V960 Mon are found in this region. For
V900 Mon we adopt the distance of about 1100 pc suggested by Reipurth et al. (2012). For
V960 Mon there is much uncertainty about the distance, Caratti o Garatti et al. (2015) and
K´osp´al et al. (2015) assume 450 pc. However, this FUor is associated with the L1649/1650
cloud complex, for which Kim et al. (2004) derive a kinematic distance of 1100 pc, and we
adopt that distance here.

Serpens. The three objects V371 Ser, IRAS 18270-0153W, and IRAS 18341-0113S
are all located within the Serpens constellation, but in three diﬀerent regions. V371 Ser is
embedded in the densest part of the Serpens Core, which has frequently been assumed to
be rather nearby, e.g. Straizys et al. (1996) determined that extinction rises at a distance
of about 259±37 pc. However, a more recent VLBA parallax study by Dzib et al. (2010)
of a young binary in the Serpens Core indicated a distance of 415±5 pc, later reﬁned to
429±2 pc (Dzib et al. 2011). This was supported by additional VLBA observations that
yielded a distance of 436±9 pc (Ortiz-Le´on et al. 2016). This suggests that the Serpens Core
is not part of the nearby Aquila Rift, but is located behind it, and the earlier extinction-based
estimates most likely refer to the Aquila cloud complex. IRAS 18270-0153W is located in the
northernmost cloud core in the ﬁlamentary cloud that contains the embedded Serpens-South
cluster (see Figure 1 of Friesen et al. 2016). It has long been assumed that Serpens-South
and the neighboring W40 star forming region are physically associated due to their similar
gas radial velocities. Several stars in W40 were included in the parallax study of Ortiz-Le´on
et al. (2016), and it thus follows that Serpens-South is likely to be at a distance of 436±9 pc,
which we therefore also adopt as the distance to IRAS 18270-0153W. For the third object
in Serpens, IRAS 18341-0113S, there is, however, no evidence that it is associated with the
more distant clouds, and at its location on the southeastern edge of the Aquila Rift (see
Figure 1 of Ortiz-Le´on et al. 2016), it seems more likely that it is part of the Aquila Rift at
the 259±37 pc distance of Straizys et al. (1996), which we thus adopt

Aquila. The FUor Parsamian 21 has a very poorly determined distance, with sugges-
tions varying from 400 pc (e.g., K´osp´al et al. 2008) to 1800 pc (Staude & Neckel 1992). The
object is located towards Cloud A of Dame & Thaddeus (1985), who suggest a kinematic
distance of 500 pc. For lack of better determinations, we here adopt a distance of 500 pc,
while recognizing its considerable uncertainty.

North America Nebula. The two FUors V1057 Cyg and HBC 722 are located to-
wards the North America Nebula (NGC 7000), which together with the Pelican Nebula (IC
5070) form a single large HII region W80 that is bifurcated by the L935 dark cloud. Nu-
merous distance determinations have been made over time, and we here adopt 550±50 pc
as determined by Laugalys et al. (2006). This distance is likely to apply to V1057 Cyg,

– 33 –

which is seen towards the northern part of the HII region. For HBC 722, which is located
on the frontside of the L935 cloud, it is possible that the distance is slightly closer, but we
also retain 550 pc for this object.

Khavtassi 141. The two FUors V2494 Cyg and HH 381 IRS are located in the L1003
cloud in Cygnus. Together with the nearby L988 cloud they form the two highest extinction
regions in the large cloud Khavtassi 141, sometimes called the Northern Coalsack. Kh 141 is
located within the Cyg OB7 association, with which it is assumed to be associated. Numerous
distance estimates towards this region have been made, resulting in values from 500 to 800 pc;
for details see the discussions in Herbig & Dahm (2006) and Khanzadyan et al.
(2012).
Following Herbig & Dahm (2006) we accept 600 pc as a compromise value.

IC 5146. V1735 Cyg is located towards the western part (L1045) of a long ﬁlamentary
cloud which at its eastern extremity harbors the star forming region IC 5146. Starting with
the study of Walker (1959) almost all studies have suggested a distance between 900 and
1200 pc (see Table 1 of Harvey et al. 2008) except Lada et al. (1999) who used extinction
measurements to suggest a distance of 460±60 pc. Upon reviewing the various methods, we
adopt the distance proposed by Harvey et al. (2008) of 950±80 pc.

L1165. The FUor HH354 IRS is embedded in the small cloud L1165, which is located
east of the HII region IC 1396, at a separation of 2.6◦. It is unclear whether or not the two
are physically associated. The distance to IC 1396 has been determined as 870±80 pc by
Contreras et al. (2002), consistent with previous estimates (e.g. ∼1000±100 pc by Garrison
& Kormendy 1976). However, the CO local standard of rest velocity is discrepant, and hence
it has been suggested that L1165 may form a foreground cloud, with a distance variously
assumed between 200 pc and 400 pc (for a discussion, see Kun et al. 2008). HH354 IRS is
associated with a maser, so an accurate distance may one day be measured, but until then
we adopt a distance of 300 pc (e.g. Dobashi et al. 1994).

C. Objects sometimes considered FUors, but not included here

We here mention three objects which occasionally appear in lists of FUors but which

we exclude in this study for the reasons stated.

Re 50 IRS1: Strom & Strom (1993) suggested that this embedded source is a FUor
based on the Hα proﬁle seen via reﬂected light. Re 50 is a complex reﬂection nebula that
It
appeared in the southern part of the L1641 cloud sometime between 1955 and 1979.
is illuminated by the embedded IRAS source 05380–0728, with a luminosity of ∼250 L⊙,
and a spectrum of the associated reﬂection nebula shows Hα and the Ca triplet in emission

– 34 –

(Reipurth & Bally 1986). Recently the northern part of the reﬂection nebula, Re 50N, closest
to the source has brightened considerably, suggesting the possibility of a FUor eruption, but
a near-infrared spectrum shows only a steeply rising featureless continuum (Chiang et al.
2015). While it is possible to imagine scenarios in which heated dust could swamp a FUor
spectrum, we consider the absence of near-infrared spectroscopic features characteristic of
FUors as disqualifying for a FUor classiﬁcation.

OO Ser: This is a deeply embedded young star that erupted before 1994, but which
faded almost back to its pre-outburst brightness in only 5 - 7 years (Hodapp et al. 2012),
a timescale that places this object between the FUors and the EXors. A K-band spectrum
obtained in 2006 showed no CO absorption bands (K´osp´al et al. 2007).

V1331 Cyg: This luminous emission-line T Tauri star has occasionally been found
in lists of FUors. It was Welin (1976) who ﬁrst suggested that V1331 Cyg might be in a
pre-FUor state, based on the similarity of its spectrum to the pre-outburst low-dispersion
objective prism spectrum of V1057 Cyg obtained by Herbig (1977). While V1331 Cyg indeed
has very strong winds and P Cygni proﬁles with deep absorption troughs on certain optical
lines (e.g., Petrov et al. 2014), its rich emission line spectrum, including the 2-µm CO bands
in emission (Carr 1989), is completely diﬀerent from all known FUors, and any speculations
on a relation to FUors remain just speculations.

Fig. 1.— J, H, and K-band spectra of the three classical FUors discussed by Herbig (1977):
FU Ori (black), V1515 Cyg (red), and V1057 Cyg (green).

– 46 –

Fig. 2.— An atlas of 33 objects each of which have been suggested in the literature to
be related to the FUor phenomenon. The light gray regions show areas of strong telluric
absorption, and the darker gray area shows where the atmosphere is quite opaque. For PP
13 S, the 1-2.5 µm spectrum has been overplotted in dark gray rescaled by a factor of 5 to
better show the features in this part of the spectrum.

Fig. 2.— The white line through the L-band portion of the spectum of IRAS 18270-0153W

Fig. 2.— For V2495 Cygni, the 1-2.5 µm spectrum that has been overplotted in dark gray
was scaled by a factor of 4 to better show the features in this part of the spectrum.

Fig. 2.— A smoothed spectrum of HH 354 IRS has been overlaid on the 3 to 4 µm region
using a Gaussian kernel with a 0.02 µm standard deviation.

– 53 –

Fig. 3.— 0.7 µm to 2.5 µm spectra of only those FUors whose outburst was observed, with
extinction added or removed to minimize the overall spectral slope. The common spectral
features thus become apparent: strong He I absorption at 1.08 µm, a strong break at 1.32 µm
and a ’triangular’ H-band continuum due to water vapor absorption and low gravity, strong
CO band heads starting at 2.29 µm, and weak metal absorption lines if any. Paβ at 1.28 µm
is also seen in absorption. The ﬂux of each spectrum has been normalized at 2.15 µm, then
oﬀset.

Fig. 4.— The He I λ 1.08 µm line proﬁle, for only bona ﬁde FUors. Nearly all of these lines
show blue shifted absorption, with a mean velocity of ∼350 kms−1.

Fig. 5.— The CO band heads, for only bona ﬁde FUors.

– 56 –

Fig. 6.— Same as for Figure 3, but for FUor-like objects (upper part) and peculiar objects
with some FUor characteristics (lower part).

Fig. 7.— V1735 Cyg brieﬂy showed unexpected spectroscopic variability in July 2016, then
returned to its nominal state when next observed the following month. The diﬀerence be-
tween the July 2016 and August 2016 spectra is shown at the bottom. We see the addition
of a featureless red continuum, but with additional CO absorption.

– 58 –

Fig. 8.— The He I λ 1.08 µm line for V1735 Cyg also showed blue shifted emission and faster
blueshifted absorption with a velocity of ∼950 kms−1 when its spectrum changed during the
July 2016 event.

Fig. 9.— In a plot of the equivalent width (EW) of CO vs the EW of Na+Ca, FUors and
FUor-like objects lie in a unique part of this space without signiﬁcant overlap with ﬁeld stars
or other YSOs. The peculiar objects tend to be located closer to (0,0). Field M-stars from
the SpeX library, shown as gray circles, are to the upper right. The dotted lines separate
the regions of absorption and emission in the ﬁgure. A gray dashed line separates the FUors
If x is the EW of Na+Ca, then the CO EW is greater than
from the rest of the YSOs.

Fig. 12.— A comparison of the near-infrared spectrum of FU Ori with that of the newborn
M5-type border-line brown dwarf HBC 341 (from Dahm & Hillenbrand 2017) and the 10 Myr
old brown dwarf TWA-8B (from Allers & Liu 2013). Selected lines are identiﬁed.

Fig. 13.— Distribution of equivalent widths of the Paschen-β line in young brown dwarfs
(red, from Allers & Liu 2013) just overlaps with the distribution for FUors and FUor-
like objects (blue, this paper), suggesting that Pa β is a useful spectroscopic discriminator
between the two types of objects.

– 66 –

Fig. 14.— The bolometric luminosity distributions for the FUors (red), FUor-like objects
(green), and the combined sample (black). Although the FUor-like objects have more low-
luminosity objects, these two distributions are not signiﬁcantly distinguishable.

– 67 –

Fig. 15.— To measure the depth of the ice band, we ﬁrst extrapolated the continuum from
2.5 to 3.8 µm. The relative ice band optical depth is calculated as -ln (continuum level/ﬂux
at 3 µm).

– 68 –

Fig. 16.— The 3.0 µm water ice absorption band optical depth (τ ) is well correlated with
the extinction for FUors, but there are a few notable exceptions. The black data points are
objects not having a reﬂection nebula at K-band. The red data points are those objects with
an infrared reﬂection nebula, and thus mostly seen in scattered light at K-band, which were
also bright enough at L-band (Parsamian 21, L1551 IRS 5, HH354 IRS, IRAS 05450+0019,
Haro 5a. and V2495 Cyg). The dotted line is our linear ﬁt to the data except for the two
objects with the highest extinction, as the optical depth appears to saturate when Av exceeds
∼30. In most cases, the y-axis error bars are too small to be seen.

a2MASS coordinate for the target
bK-band magnitudes from our observations, and are in the MKO photometric system unless otherwise noted. Z CMa was observed through

the narrow K-continuum ﬁlter to avoid saturation. 2MASS photometry is given for IRAS 18270-0153 #7.

cFUor: Eruption observed; FUor-like: Eruption not observed, but spectrum similar to FUors; Peculiar: Has some spectroscopic or photometric

similaries to FUors

eThe bolometric luminosity was calculated using photometry from 2MASS (1.2 to 2.2 µm), WISE (3.4 to 22 µm), and Akari (65 to 160 µm).

An 80 K black body was added to reddest data point. For RNO 1b/c and AR 6a/b the binary was not resolved.

f Visual extinction in magnitudes, derived from ﬁtting the spectrum to FU Ori and adding FU Ori’s 1.5 magnitudes of extinction.
