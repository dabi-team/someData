Abstract

Planetary embryos form protoplanets via mutual collisions, which can lead
to the development of magma oceans. During their solidiﬁcation, signiﬁcant
amounts of the mantles’ volatile contents may be outgassed. The resulting
H2O/CO2 dominated steam atmospheres may be lost eﬃciently via hydro-
dynamic escape due to the low gravity of these Moon- to Mars-sized objects
and the high stellar EUV luminosities of the young host stars. Protoplanets
forming from such degassed building blocks after nebula dissipation could
therefore be drier than previously expected. We model the outgassing and
subsequent hydrodynamic escape of steam atmospheres from such embryos.
The eﬃcient outﬂow of H drags along heavier species like O, CO2, and noble
gases. The full range of possible EUV evolution tracks of a young solar-
mass star is taken into account to investigate the atmospheric escape from

Mars-sized planetary embryos at diﬀerent orbital distances. The estimated
envelopes are typically lost within a few to a few tens of Myr.

Furthermore, we study the inﬂuence on protoplanetary evolution, exem-
pliﬁed by Venus. In particular, we investigate diﬀerent early evolution sce-
narios and constrain realistic cases by comparing modeled noble gas isotope
ratios with present observations. Isotope ratios of Ne and Ar can be repro-
duced, starting from solar values, under hydrodynamic escape conditions.
Solutions can be found for diﬀerent solar EUV histories, as well as assump-
tions about the initial atmosphere, assuming either a pure steam atmosphere
or a mixture with accreted hydrogen from the protoplanetary nebula. Our
results generally favor an early accretion scenario with a small amount of
residual hydrogen from the protoplanetary nebula and a low-activity Sun,
because in other cases too much CO2 is lost during evolution, which is in-
consistent with Venus’ present atmosphere. Important issues are likely the
time at which the initial steam atmosphere is outgassed and/or the amount
of CO2 which may still be delivered at later evolutionary stages. A late ac-
cretion scenario can only reproduce present isotope ratios for a highly active
young Sun, but then unrealistically massive steam atmospheres (few kbar)
would be required.

1. Introduction

In the early evolution of planetary systems, protoplanetary cores originate
from the coagulation of dust and ice and initially reside embedded in the
gas of the circumstellar disks. Terrestrial planet-formation models indicate
that Earth-like planets originate from diﬀerentiated planetesimals to large
planetary embryos with sizes of several hundred to a few thousand kilometers
(e.g. Kokubo and Ida, 2000; Raymond et al., 2004, 2009; Alibert et al., 2010;
Lunine et al., 2011; Walsh et al., 2011; Morbidelli et al., 2012). Although
the processes that are responsible for the growth of the solid bodies from
centimeter size up to the size of Moon- and Mars-size planetary embryos are
not well understood (Morbidelli et al., 2009; Johansen et al., 2014), if one
accepts the scenario of core-accretion for the formation of gaseous Jovian-
type planets (Perri and Cameron, 1974; Mizuno, 1980), massive planetary
embryos and even protoplanetary cores with several Earth-masses (M⊕) exist
even at an early stage of evolution of the protoplanetary disk. The initial

2

volatile inventory, including H2O, of terrestrial planets is related to a complex
interplay between:

• the nebula dissipation time,

• the growth rate/time from planetesimals and planetary embryos to pro-

toplanets,

• the orbit location and H2O content of the initial building blocks (i.e.,

planetesimals and planetary embryos),

• outgassing processes from the interior,

• the impact history, and

• the host star’s radiation and plasma environment.

The growth of planetary embryos to protoplanets within the accretion disk
begins during the nebula lifetime, which lasts only between ≈1–10 Myr
(Montmerle et al., 2006; Hillenbrand, 2008). Mars for instance formed within
a few Myr and remained as a large planetary embryo that never grew to a
more massive rocky planet (Brasser, 2013). Depending on the gravitational
potential of the embedded planetary embryos and protoplanets, a certain
amount of the nebula gas will be captured. As it was shown by Erkaev et al.
(2014) and St¨okl et al. (2015), cores with masses up to ≈ 0.1M⊕ capture only
a negligible amount of nebula gas which is lost fast by thermal escape shortly
after the nebula dissipates. Depending on the solar nebula parameters and
the EUV activity of the young Sun, Erkaev et al. (2014) showed that early
Mars which has a mass of ≈ 0.1M⊕ should have lost its captured nebular-
based hydrogen envelope in a very short time. For less massive bodies, or
objects at closer orbital distances, the timescales are even shorter because
of either the lower gravitational attraction or the higher EUV ﬂuxes and ef-
fective temperatures. Thus, for planetary embryos, accumulated nebular gas
does not play an important role for the bodies’ evolution into larger planetary
objects.

After the evaporation of the gas in the disk due to the extremely high X-
ray, EUV and far ultraviolet (FUV) emissions of the young T Tauri Sun/star,
protoplanets continue to grow through the capture and collisions of large
planetesimals and planetary embryos. Depending on the orbit locations, em-
bryos may form dry or wet, meaning that near and beyond the ice line the

3

planetary building blocks contain more water and icy material compared to
that which originated and orbit closer to the Sun. From dynamical mod-
els one can expect that most of Mars’ building blocks consisted of material
that formed in orbital locations just beyond the ice line which could have
contained ≈ 0.1 − 0.2 wt% of H2O, while embryos formed in Earth’s orbit
should have had lower values within a range of ≈ 0.05 − 0.1 wt% (e.g. Mor-
In the case of the Earth, geochemical
bidelli et al., 2000; Brasser, 2013).
studies indicate that a fraction of Earth’s initial H2O inventory originated
from comets, while the majority came from chondritic meteoritic materials
(Mumma and Charnley, 2011; Alexander et al., 2012; Marty, 2012). Me-
teorites are therefore the main candidates for building blocks of planetary
embryos and hence protoplanets.

The study of diﬀerent solar system objects that resemble planetary em-
bryos (such as Earth’s Moon, Mars, the asteroid Vesta, and dwarf planets
like Ceres) shows that they have been diﬀerentiated in their interiors like the
terrestrial planets (e.g. Canup and Ward, 2002; Schubert et al., 2004; Thomas
et al., 2005; Russell et al., 2013). It is thus reasonable to expect that the
silicate and metal materials of large planetary embryos of similar size were
largely molten during the formation process (e.g. Albar`ede and Blichert-Toft,
2007; Elkins-Tanton, 2008, 2012).

The formation of large and deep magma oceans can also be caused by
gravitational heating of the accreted material, accretionary impacts, and ra-
diogenic heating from short-lived radioisotopes, (e.g. Urey, 1955; Safronov,
1969; Wetherill, 1980; LaTourrette and Wasserburg, 1998; Halliday et al.,
2001; Albar`ede and Blichert-Toft, 2007; Elkins-Tanton, 2012). Magma oceans
are responsible for the compositional diﬀerentiation that aﬀects the ﬁnal
volatile contents of the planetary building blocks, including large planetes-
imals, planetary embryos, protoplanets or large moons, whose radii range
from tens to hundreds, or even thousands of kilometers. The melting re-
lated to the diﬀerentiation results in compositionally distinct layers, where
the denser materials sink to the center, and less dense materials rise to the
surface. Such processes ﬁnally create a core and mantle in planetary bodies.
Volatiles such as H2O and carbon compounds (e.g., CO2, CH4, CO) are
integrated in the magma ocean liquids and as solidiﬁcation proceeds they
are degassed into a growing steam atmosphere (Matsui and Abe, 1986; Abe
and Matsui, 1988; Zahnle et al., 1988; Massol et al., 2016). The quantity
of volatiles available for degassing depends on the bulk composition of the
magma ocean. The solidiﬁcation of a magma ocean starts at the bottom be-

4

cause the steep slope of the adiabat with respect to the solidus in the pressure-
temperature space causes them to intersect ﬁrst at depth (e.g. Walker et al.,
1975; Solomatov, 2000; Elkins-Tanton, 2008, 2011, 2012). Depending on the
assumed H2O (≈ 0.05−0.1 wt%) and CO2 (≈0.01−0.02 wt%) content with
bulk magma ocean depths between ≈500−2000 km for a Mars-size body,
minimum and maximum partial surface pressures PH2O and PCO2 of catas-
trophically outgassed steam atmospheres are estimated to be ≈30−120 bar
and ≈7−25 bar (Elkins-Tanton, 2008; Lebrun et al., 2013; Erkaev et al.,
2014).

As pointed out by Lammer et al. (2013), depending on the EUV ﬂux
evolution of the young Sun/star, Moon- or Mars-sized planetary embryos will
lose a fraction of their outgassed volatiles and their initial water inventories
because of the formation of magma oceans within the growth process to larger
protoplanets. It has been known for decades that the Sun’s radiation in the
EUV region of the spectrum was higher in the past (e.g. Zahnle and Walker,
1982; G¨udel et al., 1997; Guinan and Ribas, 2002; Ribas et al., 2005; Claire
et al., 2012). Recently, Tu et al. (2015) showed that the star’s initial rotation
rate and its subsequent rotational evolution (Johnstone et al., 2015a) play
an important role for the EUV ﬂux enhancement, until the time when the
radiation ﬂux converges to similar age dependent values after about 1.5 Gyr
in the case of solar-like G stars. About 70% of the solar mass stars studied
by Johnstone et al. (2015a) are slow and moderate rotators, but there is
a non-negligible possibility for the early Sun to have been a fast rotator.
These ﬁndings have enormous implications for the initial volatile inventories
of terrestrial planets and, later on, their atmospheric evolution.

If one assumes that the young Sun was initially a fast rotator, then its
EUV emission could have been enhanced up to about 500 times compared
to its present value for more than 200 Myr. If the Sun was once a moderate
rotator then the EUV emission would have been about 100 times higher dur-
ing the ﬁrst 100 Myr. If the Sun was a slow rotator then its EUV luminosity
would have been about 25–30 times higher for ≈ 30 − 300 Myr. According to
Tu et al. (2015), the EUV ﬂux decreases for all rotators following power laws
until the diﬀerent evolutionary paths merge after about 1.5 Gyr. Because
the EUV radiation heats the upper atmospheres of planets one can expect a
huge variety of evolution scenarios depending on the stars’ diﬀerent rotation
and activity evolution during the ﬁrst 1.5 Gyr. As a consequence, planetary
embryos which form and grow in a system where the host star is a slow ro-
tator should remain wetter and more volatile-rich compared to those which

5

grow in a system of moderately or fast rotating young stars.

The discovery of a large number of sub-Neptune type exoplanets indicates
that fast formation of suﬃciently large cores which then accrete residual
nebula gas is common. St¨okl et al. (2016) found that a core of 0.7MVenus
(∼ 0.6M⊕) may accrete gas of up to 2–3% of its mass within a typical nebula
lifetime. The core luminosity can drive eﬃcient outﬂow of such accreted gas
envelopes when the conﬁning pressure of the disk decreases, but cores with
masses > 0.5M⊕ are rather stable to this loss process (St¨okl et al., 2015,
2016). After the disk dissipates at the orbital location of the protoplanet a
signiﬁcant fraction of such a protoatmosphere can be lost in timescales of
a few Myr by “boil-oﬀ” driven by the envelope contraction and bolometric
luminosity of the host star (Owen and Wu, 2016; Ginzburg et al., 2016;
Lammer et al., 2016) and enhanced by the initially very extended envelopes
(comparable to the Bondi radius, i.e. r0 ∼ GMp/(2c2
s)). Due to this eﬃcient
mass-loss, the protoplanet’s H atmosphere quickly shrinks until reaching a
more stable escape regime. Recent studies found that this occurs when the
radius shrinks below 0.1 Bondi radii (Owen and Wu, 2016) or, equivalently,
when the Jeans escape parameter at r0 becomes larger than about 20 (Fossati
et al., 2017; Cubillos et al., 2017).

The recent Ru isotope analysis of primitive meteoritic material (Fischer-
G¨odde and Kleine, 2017) indicates that volatile-rich carbonaceous chondritic
bodies were scattered from the outer into the inner solar system early in
Earth’s, Venus’ and Mars’ accretion phase, contradicting previous studies
of Albar`ede (2009). Therefore, one can expect that these bodies originated
in a very cold environment beyond the ice-line and remained most likely
volatile-rich. This scenario is in agreement with dynamical model results
related to the “Grand Tack” hypothesis (Walsh et al., 2011; O’Brien et al.,
2014). In this model, Jupiter migrated inwards to the terrestrial planet re-
gion and subsequently outwards to its present location due to the inﬂuence
of Saturn. This resulted in scattering of material to the terrestrial planet re-
gion, but cleared the disk down to about 1 AU, which can explain why Mars
If this migration scenario of Jupiter
remained small (Walsh et al., 2011).
scattered volatile-rich primitive planetesimals towards the inner planets, nu-
merous large volatile-rich carbonaceous chondritic impactors may have col-
lided with the early terrestrial proto-planets. In such a case their volatiles
could have been delivered eﬃciently to proto-Venus, proto-Earth and early
Mars (O’Brien et al., 2014).

Regardless of the detailed EUV history of the host star, embryos generally

6

lose their potential atmospheres faster than more massive bodies because of
their lower gravities. Moreover, embryos in orbits closer to the star are more
strongly aﬀected because the stellar EUV ﬂuxes are higher. This means
that if close-in planets such as Venus accreted from embryos which have
been located near the planet’s orbit during a few million years, they may
have accreted from drier material. Large impacts occurring after several
tens of Myr could possibly only deliver negligible amounts of volatiles to the
growing planets at such orbital distances, except if they have just recently
been scattered inwards from the outer regions of the system.

Another consequence of eﬃcient atmospheric escape on planetary em-
bryos or protoplanets is the fractionation of noble gases (e.g. Pepin, 1991).
Both element abundances and isotope ratios of a single element are expected
to be altered due to the escape of a protoatmosphere. Donahue (1986) in-
vestigated the escape from planetesimals and related isotope fractionation
via Jeans escape. However, this author suggested, that while being possi-
ble, it would be more likely that a less mass-dependent process would be
better suited. This was also noted by Hunten et al. (1987) who favored hy-
drodynamic escape due to its weaker mass-dependence and because it was
able to produce results that are comparable with observations on various
planets. Numerous studies aimed to explain the observed noble gas patterns
on the terrestrial planets via escape of a protoatmosphere during the ﬁrst
evolutionary stages (e.g. Sekiya et al., 1980; Hunten et al., 1987; Sasaki and
Nakazawa, 1988; Zahnle et al., 1990; Pepin, 1991; Gillmann et al., 2009).
However, the possibility that the building blocks forming these planets could
have been fractionated before by hydrodynamic escape has not been studied
yet in detail.

This work is the ﬁrst attempt to address these important aspects that
have received so far little attention. We estimate the escape of H2O and CO2
atmospheres resulting from magma ocean degassing of Mars-sized planetary
embryos at orbital locations of Venus (0.7 AU), Earth (1 AU) and Mars
(1.5 AU) that are exposed to the EUV emission of a slowly, moderately and
fast rotating young solar-like star. In Section 2 we describe the applied model
and input parameters. Subsequently, we present the results, the atmospheric
evolution of Mars-like embryos (Section 3) and a proto-Venus scenario includ-
ing constraints from noble gas isotope fractionation (Section 4). In Section 5
we discuss the results and model limitations, and present the conclusions in
Section 6.

2. Model description

Stellar EUV photons within the wavelength range of ∼10–91.2 nm are the
main heating source in the upper atmospheres of planetary bodies (e.g. Wat-
son et al., 1981; Chasseﬁ`ere, 1996a,b; Tian et al., 2009; Tian, 2015; Erkaev
et al., 2014, 2016). Stellar FUV emission, including the Schumann-Runge
continuum, is another important heating source dominating in the lower
thermosphere of present Earth via dissociation of O2 (Roble et al., 1987).
However, it is not clear how eﬃcient this process is in a massive hot steam
atmosphere since no detailed photochemical models are available for such
atmospheres. Moreover, stellar FUV is enhanced only by factors of a few
in young stars compared to today’s value, whereas X-rays and EUV can be
higher by factors of a few tens or hundreds (Claire et al., 2012; Tu et al.,
2015). Therefore, we ignore this potential additional heating source in our
present model. After the phase of catastrophic volatile outgassing in the
form of H2O and CO2 from planetary embryos during their magma ocean
solidiﬁcation phase, the upper atmosphere is heated due to absorption of the
incoming EUV radiation, leading to excitation, dissociation and ionization
of the gas components. The high EUV ﬂuxes of the young star will therefore
lead to the dissociation of H2O and CO2 molecules (e.g. Chasseﬁ`ere, 1996b;
Tian et al., 2009; Lammer, 2013). Because of the eﬃcient dissociation of H2O
one can expect that planetary embryos have initially a hydrogen-dominated
upper atmosphere. Such an atmosphere will expand hydrodynamically and
escape eﬃciently (e.g. Watson et al., 1981; Chasseﬁ`ere, 1996b,a; Tian et al.,
2005b; Lammer et al., 2013, 2014; Erkaev et al., 2013, 2014).

2.1. Stellar EUV emission

Stellar EUV emission is the main driver of atmospheric escape in young
planetary systems. A detailed study of the evolution of the stellar EUV out-
put of Sun-like stars was performed by Tu et al. (2015). For stars younger
than about 2 Gyr, the intrinsic spread in stellar rotation rates and corre-
sponding high-energy emission is large. To explore all possible scenarios we
model atmospheric escape for three cases of stellar EUV evolution tracks,
corresponding to the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the rotation rate dis-
tribution (hereafter termed slow, moderate, and fast rotators) from Tu et al.
(2015). Stars spin down with age because of angular momentum loss via
magnetized stellar winds. Since rotation and magnetic activity (e.g. in form
of the high-energy X-ray and EUV emission) are closely related in Sun-like

8

stars via the magnetic dynamo, this leads to a decrease in magnetic activity
with rotation rate over time. At young ages, however, the stellar X-ray and
EUV emission is saturated at a roughly constant fraction of the star’s bolo-
metric luminosity (LX ∼ 10−3Lbol). This saturation phase lasts for about 5.7,
23, and 226 Myr for the slow, moderate, and fast rotator tracks. Afterwards
the EUV luminosity LEUV (100–920 ˚A) decays as

LEUV =

90th,

(1)

where t is the stellar age in Myr. The saturation value LEUV,sat can be found
from Eq. 1 by inserting the corresponding saturation times, which yields a
common value of ∼ 1031 erg s−1 for a solar-like star. Hereafter we will refer
to these minimum, average and maximum EUV evolution tracks as the slow,
moderate and fast rotator scenarios.

2.2. Escape ﬂuxes and hydrodynamic drag

Under the high EUV ﬂuxes of young stars, atmospheres of planetary
embryos and protoplanets escape hydrodynamically (Watson et al., 1981;
Kasting and Pollack, 1983; Erkaev et al., 2014, 2016). A simple estimate
of the hydrodynamic escape rate is given by the energy-limited equation
(Watson et al., 1981; Erkaev et al., 2007). For a three-component atmosphere,
it can be written as

miFi + mjFj + mkFk =

β2ηFEUV
4∆Φ

≡ ˙m,

(2)

where mi,j,k are the particle masses, Fi,j,k = ni,j,kvi,j,k the escape ﬂuxes at
r0 (in cm−2 s−1 sterad−1), η is the heating eﬃciency, FEUV the stellar EUV
ﬂux at the orbit, ∆Φ = GM/r0 the object’s gravitational potential at r0,
and ˙m the total mass-loss rate (in g cm−2 s−1 sterad−1). The parameter
β = rEUV/r0 is the ratio of the eﬀective radius rEUV where the bulk of the
incoming EUV radiation is absorbed to the atmospheric radius r0.

We aim to study the hydrodynamic escape of atomic H which drags along
heavier constituents of the upper atmosphere (e.g. O, C, CO2, noble gases).
Speciﬁcally, we consider one heavy major species (such as O in a dissociated
H2O atmosphere), as well as an arbitrary number of heavy minor species.
Hereafter, we will refer to the light major species with index i, the heavy

9

major species with index j, and the heavy minor species with index k. To
obtain the escape ﬂuxes of the heavier constituents, we follow the method of
Zahnle and Kasting (1986) and Zahnle et al. (1990). They write the escape
ﬂuxes of the dragged heavy species Fj,k as

Fj,k = Fifj,kxj,k,

(3)

is the escape ﬂux of the light major species (here, H), fj,k =
where Fi
nj,k/ni ∼ Nj,k/Ni is the mixing ratio relative to species i (n are the local
number densities, N the atmospheric inventories) and xj,k the fractionation
factors. From comparison of Eq. 3 with the deﬁnition of the escape ﬂux
one can see that the fractionation factors correspond to the velocity ratios
vj,k/vi. For xj,k, Zahnle and Kasting (1986) and Zahnle et al. (1990) obtained
analytic approximations by introducing some simpliﬁcations into the multi-
species hydrodynamic equations (e.g. subsonic ﬂow, isothermal conditions).
Zahnle et al. (1990) showed that these expressions provide good approxima-
tions also for transonic escape, because the relative ﬂuxes of the species are
already determined in the subsonic region.

The fractionation factors xj and xk of the heavier species can be written

as

and

xj = 1 −

where g is the gravitational acceleration at the base of the ﬂow r0, kB is
the Boltzmann constant, and T the upper atmosphere temperature (Zahnle
et al., 1990). The expression for xk is more complicated, because the minor
species feel the drag of both major constituents, but they themselves cannot
inﬂuence the ﬂow of the major gas components (or other minor elements)
due to their small abundances. The binary diﬀusion parameters are given
by bH,O = 4.8 × 1017T 0.75 cm−1 s−1, bH,CO2 = 8.4 × 1017T 0.6 cm−1 s−1 and
bO,CO2 = 7.86 × 1016T 0.776 cm−1 s−1(Zahnle and Kasting, 1986). Equation 4
describes the fractionation of the major heavy species (here, O) and is similar
to the frequently used expression derived by Hunten et al. (1987), except that
it does not require that the heavy component is a minor species (i.e. fj(cid:51)1),
and is therefore more suitable for calculating the escape of a dissociated H2O

10

atmosphere. Equation 5 describes the fractionation of the additional heavy
minor species (e.g. C, CO2, noble gases), which feel the drag from both major
gases. If there is no heavy major species in the atmosphere, the escape of
minor heavy species would be described by Eq. 4.

The fractionation factors take values between one (all species escape eﬃ-
ciently with similar velocities) and zero (the heavy species cannot escape). If
the latter case occurs for the major heavy species, escape of the light species
is then limited by diﬀusion through the static, heavy background gas, and
its escape ﬂux can be found from Eq. 4 by setting xj = 0. If xk = 0, the
light gas still escapes hydrodynamically, but the concerned minor species is
maintained. The escape ﬂuxes are thus given by Eq. 3 if xj,k > 0, whereas
they are zero otherwise.

One can see from Eq. 2 that the escape ﬂuxes of all three species are
connected. Combining Eq. 2 with Eq. 3 allows to express the escape ﬂux of
the light main species as

Fi =

β2ηFEUV
4∆Φ (mi + mjfjxj + mkfkxk)

,

(6)

which indicates that Fi is reduced by the presence of the heavier species com-
pared to a single-component atmosphere. The evolution of the atmosphere
is calculated by integrating the escape ﬂuxes (Eqs. 3 and 6) in time. The
stellar EUV ﬂux (Eq. 1), as well as the mixing ratios f and fractionation
factors x are hereby functions of time. All other parameters are assumed to
be constant.

If species i, which is at ﬁrst the lightest major gas component, is signiﬁ-
cantly depleted from an atmosphere and is not able to drag along the other
constituents anymore, then a heavier main species could under certain con-
ditions also escape hydrodynamically. Then its escape ﬂux could also drag
along the remaining minor heavy species if the outﬂow is strong enough,
which can be described using i → j, j → k, and Fk = 0 in Eq. 2. We explore
this scenario in more detail in Appendix Appendix A using a hydrodynamic
model applied to an O-dominated atmosphere.

3. Atmospheric loss from Mars-sized embryos

We investigate the loss of magma ocean degassed H2O/CO2 atmospheres
from Mars-like planetary embryos at the orbits of Venus, Earth and Mars,
exposed to the EUV emission of a slowly, moderately and rapidly rotating

11

young Sun-like star under hydrodynamic escape conditions. We apply mass
fractionation equations (e.g. Zahnle and Kasting, 1986; Lichtenegger et al.,
2016) which have ﬁrst been developed in simpler form by Hunten (1973) and
Hunten et al. (1987). Such mass fractionation scenarios have been studied
in the past mainly for the investigation of the possible build-up of O2 in
planetary atmospheres that experience strong hydrodynamic escape of dis-
sociation products of water (e.g. Chasseﬁ`ere, 1996b; Lammer et al., 2011;
Luger and Barnes, 2015; Tian and Ida, 2015; Tian, 2015).

3.1. Magma ocean outgassing

The thermal evolution of a convecting magma ocean is studied using a
one-dimensional model based on the approach of Elkins-Tanton (2008) and
Lebrun et al. (2013). Here we only highlight the modeling aspects relevant
to the outgassing process, and refer the reader to the above papers for more
details. We assume the magma ocean to solidify from its base upwards
because of the steeper slope of the liquid adiabat with respect to the mantle
liquidus and solidus chosen to be those of KLB-1 peridotite (Zhang and
Herzberg, 1994; Herzberg et al., 2000). Two volatile species, water (H2O)
and carbon dioxide (CO2), are assumed to be outgassed during the magma
ocean evolution. In order for a volatile to be released into the atmosphere, its
concentration in the magma ocean has to be supersaturated. Supersaturation
means that the concentration of a volatile (here H2O, CO2) in a silicate melt
should be higher than its solubility concentration. We use the saturation
curves of Carroll and Holloway (1994) for H2O and Pan et al. (1991) for CO2,
and compare the evolving concentration of the volatile in the magma ocean
against them at each time step. When the magma ocean is supersaturated,
the excess volatile content is outgassed in the atmosphere, building up its
mass. We consider two diﬀerent scenarios for the depth extent of the magma
ocean: a partial magma ocean with a depth of 500 km and a global one
extending to 1700 km, i.e. to the expected core-mantle boundary depth of
Mars (Sohl and Spohn, 1997).

The 1D model used to estimate the volatile outgassing resolves the solid-
iﬁcation process of an existing magma ocean and not the process of how it is
generated. Therefore, the magma ocean depth and its volatile concentration
are starting conditions of the simulation and have to be chosen as model
parameters. The initial depth of the magma ocean is diﬃcult to constrain
due to the unknown impact history of the hypothetical embryo. By assuming
global (1700 km) and partial (500 km) magma ocean depths we cover two

end-member cases. The model assumes a Mars-like interior structure with a
core radius of 1700 km. The ﬁnal outgassed quantity depends on the initial
volatile abundance of the building blocks of the planet. Bulk mantle values
were chosen in order to span a broad range deﬁned between primitive and
present-day conditions:
from 100 to 10000 ppm for H2O, and from 10 to
1000 ppm for CO2. For reference, estimates of the water concentration of
the present-day Earth’s upper mantle range from 50 to 200 ppm (Saal et al.,
2002), of the primitive mantle from 550 to 1900 ppm (Jambon and Zimmer-
mann, 1990), while CI carbonaceous chondrites can contain up to 25 wt%
H2O (Garenne et al., 2014). The CO2 content of the Earth’s mantle is ex-
pected to vary between about 20 and 1300 ppm (Dasgupta and Hirschmann,
2010).

The cumulative abundances of outgassed H2O and CO2 for the various
scenarios that we tested are listed in Table 1. The partial pressures that we
obtained agree with those given by Erkaev et al. (2014) and Elkins-Tanton
(2008), within ≈ 10% for H2O and less than 1% for CO2, because of the use
of slightly diﬀerent saturation curves.

3.2. Adopted parameters and initial conditions

We use Eqs. 3 and 6 to calculate the evolution of the outgassed hot
steam atmospheres (Abe and Matsui, 1988; Marcq, 2012; Massol et al., 2016).
For the embryo properties we adopt the mass and radius of current Mars
(MMars = 6.42 × 1023 kg, rMars = 3396 km). The surface temperatures are
in the order of 103 K, i.e. magma oceans. Mesopause heights z0 are in the
order of several 102−103 km for Mars-like bodies with such atmospheres, with
mesopause temperatures T0 comparable to the equilibrium temperatures at
the orbits (Marcq, 2012). Such hot atmospheres are typically well-mixed up
to large heights (Abe and Matsui, 1988; Kasting, 1988; Lupu et al., 2014).
We adopt a mesopause height of z0 = 1000 km, which is representative
for steam atmospheres above a molten magma ocean (Marcq, 2012; Erkaev
et al., 2014). Thus, r0 = rMars + z0 = 4390 km. We assume β = 1 for all
calculations, as one needs detailed hydrodynamic modeling to evaluate this
parameter. In reality both r0 and β are time dependent and decrease when
the atmospheric mass decreases signiﬁcantly and/or the composition becomes
dominated by the heavier constituents. Thus we tend to overestimate the
escape rates, especially at later evolutionary stages. We adopt a heating
eﬃciency of 15% which is representative for H-dominated atmospheres of
hot Jupiters (Shematovich et al., 2014), but similar values were also used
in other water loss studies (Kasting and Pollack, 1983; Chasseﬁ`ere, 1996b;
Tian, 2015). The impact of all these assumptions is discussed in more detail
in Section 5.

We assume that atmospheric escape starts at a system age of t0 = 10 Myr.
The gas disk should be dispersed within a few Myr (Haisch et al., 2001;
Montmerle et al., 2006) and all embryos and existing protoplanets are then
exposed to the EUV emission of the host star. Due to the low gravity, any
accreted H/He envelope around a Mars-like body is removed very fast on
timescales of < 1 Myr (Erkaev et al., 2014; St¨okl et al., 2015; Massol et al.,
2016). After colliding with other objects, magma oceans may form and degas
volatiles during the solidiﬁcation phase. This occurs on a timescale in the
order of 0.1 Myr (e.g. Elkins-Tanton, 2008; Lebrun et al., 2013), depending
on orbital distance, planet size, atmospheric mass and composition. Based
on the model described in Section 3.1 the outgassing takes 0.5 Myr for the
233 bar and 2 Myr for the 1237 bar (PH2O = 1109 bar, PCO2 = 128 bar)
atmosphere. The greenhouse eﬀect and thermal blanketing of the outgassed
volatiles themselves prolong the magma ocean lifetime. We assume that
the initial outgassing occurs close to the age of 10 Myr so that the initial

14

steam atmosphere already exists at this point. Note that our results do not
strongly depend on the exact value of t0 because of the initially saturated
EUV emission (Section 2.1). However, new magma ocean phases at later
stages are possible after large impacts when the stellar EUV ﬂuxes are already
lower compared to the initial stage shortly after disk dispersal.

We study two cases in detail, namely a moderately massive atmosphere
with 96 bar (PH2O = 85 bar, PCO2 = 11 bar) and a more massive atmosphere
with 233 bar (PH2O = 207 bar, PCO2 = 26 bar) (cf. Table 1). Atmospheres
of lower masses are removed very quickly. The surface pressures are used to
calculate the initial inventories of each species, assuming complete dissocia-
tion of H2O into H and O in the upper atmosphere due to the stellar EUV
ﬂux. For CO2 we study two limiting cases, one where it remains in molecular
form and another where it is completely dissociated into C and O, the latter
being likely more realistic for the considered EUV ﬂuxes.

3.3. Atmospheric loss from Mars-sized embryos

Here we present the results of our model of escaping H2O/CO2 steam
atmospheres from Mars-like planetary embryos. The resulting evolution of
partial surface pressures at diﬀerent orbits and assuming three stellar rotation
tracks are shown in Fig. 1 for the 96 bar case and in Fig. 2 for the 233 bar
case.

Generally, the loss of all three species occurs at approximately the same
times. Under the assumption of complete dissociation of CO2, C is dragged
with the ﬂow eﬃciently in most cases because of its low mass. However, even
CO2 is lost so eﬃciently that the timescales for atmospheric loss are approx-
imately equal, except for the slow rotator/Mars orbit case. In this scenario,
the evolution cannot be followed to the end for CO2 (also for C in the 233 bar
case) because the third (initially minor) species accumulates so that the at-
mosphere consists of three major species (which we deﬁne as Ni/Ntot ≥ 0.1
here). Since there exists no simple analytic approximation to this scenario,
such cases would have to be studied using a more advanced numerical model.
In case of completely dissociated CO2, the 96 bar atmosphere disappears at
12–27 Myr. For the 233 bar case complete loss occurs at 14–30 Myr, but
the slow rotator/Mars orbit case cannot be calculated to the end because at
about 85 Myr, C has accumulated. In Fig. 2, this is represented by subse-
quent constant evolution of the partial surface pressures indicated by dotted
lines. The shaded areas denote the water condensation times as obtained by

15

Lebrun et al. (2013). These are the average times at which the steam at-
mospheres would condense at the respective orbits according to their model,
preventing further escape of H2O. However, this does not take into account
that the surfaces are likely to remain molten for longer times due to frequent
impacts (Debaille et al., 2007; Maindl et al., 2015), which prolongs the time
periods during which water remains in steam form and does not condense.
Figures 1 and 2 indicate that at Mars’ orbit embryos remain rich in water
and volatiles.

Under the assumption that all CO2 remains in molecular form, it escapes
slightly less eﬃciently than if dissociated due to its higher mass. Interestingly,
the loss times are essentially similar to those for dissociated CO2. This is
because the total mass-loss rate ˙m (Eq. 2) remains the same, but the particle
escape ﬂuxes Fi,j,k of the individual species are diﬀerent. However, for the
slow rotator/Mars orbit case, CO2 escapes so ineﬃciently that it accumulates
so that the atmosphere eventually consists of three major components at
25 (70) Myr for the 96 (233) bar atmosphere. As mentioned before, such
cases cannot be described with the simple analytic formulae from Section 2.2
(as discussed in Zahnle et al., 1990) and is complicated by the fact that
large amounts of (almost) non-escaping CO2 could substantially reduce the
escape of H and O which must then diﬀuse through a static background
atmosphere. Moreover, the presence of non-negligible amounts of CO2 could
lead to eﬃcient cooling by infrared radiation (e.g. Kulikov et al., 2007).

The maximum possible outgassed atmosphere of 1237 bar (Table 1) is
removed at 32–55 Myr between Venus’ and Earth’s orbit in the fast rotator
case and at 35 Myr in the moderate rotator case at Venus’ orbit. All other
combinations of orbits and rotation tracks would not be able to remove such
a massive atmosphere within 100 Myr. On the other hand, the low-mass at-
mospheres from Table 1 are removed very quickly in all orbits for all rotation
tracks, typically within a few Myr.

The eﬃcient loss of heavier atoms like O and C and even molecules like
CO2 also has consequences for noble gases and their isotopes which may also
be dragged with the outﬂow of the main atmospheric constituents. Their
escape eﬃciency, or if they escape at all, depends on their masses. Lower mass
elements escape more eﬃciently than elements with higher masses (cf. Eq. 5).
If an element with a certain mass is dragged with the ﬂow this implies that
elements with lower masses also escape. For instance, rapid loss of O2 would
imply that also Ne and its isotopes are removed quickly. If CO2 escapes, also
Ar and its isotopes are removed. Therefore, since larger terrestrial planets

Mars, and since such smaller planets can experience fast atmospheric mass-
loss, volatiles in the atmospheres of planetary embryos might already be
fractionated before the embryos are incorporated into planets. However,
this is only relevant if embryos still possess remnant atmospheres when they
collide. Moreover, since Mars-like embryos lose their volatiles within a few
Myr at the orbit of Venus, it is likely that the building blocks of Venus
were volatile-poor, especially if it accreted late. However, if some embryos
were scattered inwards from regions beyond Mars’ orbit, these could have
provided volatile-rich material. This may have aﬀected the formation and
early evolution of protoplanets.

4. Atmospheric loss from Proto-Venus

To study the eﬀect of the previously discussed issues on the formation of
protoplanets we investigate the early evolution of Venus as an example. Two
possible scenarios of Venus’ past evolution are sketched in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst
possibility is an early accretion of a proto-Venus within the nebula, which
results in accumulation of a hydrogen-dominated protoatmosphere. That
proto-Venus and proto-Earth grew to masses of about 0.5−0.75M⊕ within
10 Myr so that they could capture thin H2-envelopes is also in agreement
with the model results for the “Grand Tack” hypothesis (Walsh et al., 2011;
O’Brien et al., 2014). These recent ﬁndings on dynamics, terrestrial planet
formation, as well as observations of low-mass exoplanets with H-dominated
envelopes, support earlier hypotheses that the early Earth may have been
surrounded by a thin H2-dominated protoatmosphere. Isotope fractionation
may then be obtained from escape of this protoatmosphere with possible ad-
ditionally outgassed volatiles. The second possibility is late accretion where
the planet formed after the nebula dissipated.
In this case fractionation
can only be obtained by escape of a steam atmosphere. However, in this
scenario the question arises how volatile-rich such a planet may be since
both nebula-accreted and outgassed atmospheres are lost from planetary em-
bryos eﬃciently, especially at the orbit of Venus (cf. Section 3; Albar`ede and
Blichert-Toft, 2007; Albar`ede, 2009).

Possible scenarios are constrained by observations of noble gas isotope
ratios (e.g. Gillmann et al., 2009). The fractionation of noble gases in an
escaping atmosphere is described by Eq. 5 and can be easily included in the
model. Since these elements are very minor compared to the other atmo-

the nebula and accreted a H-dominated protoatmosphere. Large impacts contributed to

ﬁnal planet forms through collisions between embryos.

spheric constituents, one can ignore their impact on the escape rates of the
more prominent species (Eq. 2) and simply calculate their escape ﬂuxes us-
ing Eq. 3. We assume that initially the abundances of the noble gases in the
atmosphere are equal to the solar values. To estimate the initial amounts
of Ne, Ar and their isotopes, we use the solar abundances given in Halliday
(2013) and the solar isotope ratios from Pepin (1991). We determine all
abundances relative to H (Halliday, 2013) and multiply these ratios with the
initial atmospheric H inventories. Note that the evolution of an isotope ratio
of a single element is independent of its initial abundance. Binary diﬀusion
parameters for Ne and Ar are taken from Zahnle and Kasting (1986) and are
assumed to be equal for an element and its isotopes.

4.1. Early accretion
4.1.1. Adopted parameters and initial conditions

In the early accretion scenario it is assumed that a proto-Venus has grown
to a mass of 0.7 MVenus within the protoplanetary nebula. We assume the
protoplanet’s radius is rp = 0.89 RVenus, yielding the same density as present
Venus. The missing mass is expected to be delivered within ≤ 50 Myr by
impacts of planetesimals and planetary embryos. As before, we adopt a

20

starting time of t0 = 10 Myr and assume that initial atmospheric escape
due to “boil-oﬀ” has already occurred before this time. Moreover, since
escape rates in the boil-oﬀ regime are very high compared to the EUV-
driven regime we can assume that it does not fractionate the considered
isotopes eﬃciently before the slower EUV-driven escape sets in. Thus we
only consider remnant envelope mass fractions <3% at t0 (St¨okl et al., 2016).
Moreover, we assume that also an outgassed Venus-type steam atmosphere
of 559 bar (PH2O = 458 bar, PCO2 = 101 bar) (Lichtenegger et al., 2016) is
already present. We note, however, that an assumed steam atmosphere only
marginally aﬀects the results, especially for high H contents.

The choice of r0 for such H-rich atmospheres has a strong inﬂuence on the
results. According to models (e.g. Lopez and Fortney, 2014) a young pro-
toplanet with 0.7MVenus may have an optical transit radius up to ∼ 4.7R⊕
(∼ 5RVenus) for a 1% H-dominated atmosphere at an age of 10 Myr. This
would place the protoplanet in the boil-oﬀ regime. Since we consider the
slower EUV-driven evolution only, we estimate an upper limit to the radius
(rmax) by requiring that the escape parameter at r0, λ0 = GM µmH/(kT0r0),
must be ≥ 20 (Fossati et al., 2017). We adopt µ = 2.35 as for solar compo-
sition gas (neglecting the steam contribution because the considered nebula
atmospheres are typically much more massive). As a minimum radius (rmin)
we assume that of a pure steam atmosphere rp + 300 km (Lichtenegger et al.,
2016). Note that we keep r0 ﬁxed in time as before, but study the inﬂuence
of diﬀerent choices of r0.

We explore two diﬀerent scenarios, one with a proto-Venus (0.7MVenus,
0.89RVenus) and three Mars-like impactors, and one with a fast-forming com-
plete Venus (MVenus = 4.87 × 1024 kg, RVenus = 6052 km) emerging out of the
nebula to illustrate the inﬂuence of the assumptions about the initial condi-
tion and impact history. We obtain rmax = 2rp = 1.78RVenus and 2.55RVenus
for masses of 0.7MVenus and 1MVenus, respectively. The adopted minimum
radii correspond to 1.06rp = 0.94RVenus and 1.05RVenus, respectively. Here
we assume that the impactors have 0.75MMars and 0.9RMars so that the ﬁnal
planet has 1MVenus, for better comparison between the two scenarios. The
impactors only add mass to the protoplanet’s core. We add three impactors
at 20, 30 and 40 Myr, to ﬁnally obtain a ∼1MVenus planet.

4.1.2. Atmospheric evolution

To study the EUV-driven atmospheric evolution and associated fractiona-
tion of noble gases, we calculate a grid of evolutionary scenarios with diﬀerent

21

initial H inventories, a steam atmosphere (assumed to be well mixed with H)
and the three stellar rotational evolution tracks. Since our results do not
depend signiﬁcantly on the assumption of molecular or dissociated CO2 be-
cause the initial partial pressures of H are much larger than that of the other
steam constituents, we keep it in molecular form.

The evolution of the noble gas isotope ratios depends sensitively on the
escape rates (and their evolution), as well as the initial atmospheric H con-
tent. For all three stellar rotation tracks we aim to ﬁnd the initial amount of
H with which we can reproduce the present-day isotope ratios at some point
during the evolution. Moreover, we require that the isotope ratios remain
constant within the uncertainties of the measurements to ensure that they are
not overfractionated later. At t0, we adopt a ∼560 bar steam atmosphere and
add additional H (assumed to be a remnant of the accreted protoatmosphere
from nebula), leaving the exact amount as a free parameter. Generally, the
isotope ratios evolve from values higher than on present Venus (i.e. solar
ones) towards the desired parameter region, but may also drop below these
values. If too much H is present at t0, the ratios always remain above the
present-day values during the evolution; if too little H is assumed, they may
drop below present-day values. Only small ranges of H abundances at t0 lead
to the desired values of the isotope ratios for every considered case.

Table 2 gives the range of H mass fractions from the nebula which lead
to isotope ratios in the range of present-day Venusian values. We ﬁnd valid
solutions for almost all scenarios, except for the fast rotator/rmax case for
which unrealistically large amounts of H ((cid:29)3%) would have to be added.
In the slow rotator/rmin cases, the ratios remain slightly above present-day
levels even if H is reduced to zero and pure steam atmospheres are assumed.
Table 2 also gives the system ages tH at which all hydrogen would be lost (i.e.
its partial pressure drops below a few bar) and the remaining amount of CO2
at these times. The latter is important because Venus has about 90 bar of
CO2 in its atmosphere; therefore scenarios reducing CO2 by a large amount
are less realistic. Generally, scenarios with more eﬃcient escape (e.g. due to
faster stellar rotation or larger assumed r0 values) require more additional
H and therefore have longer evolution times tH. This is because if escape
rates are high, isotopes of a single element with their comparable masses are
dragged with the ﬂow at more similar rates which decreases fractionation.
This means that longer evolution times are needed until the present isotope
ratios are reached, which is only possible if the initial atmospheres are massive
enough.

22

Examples yielding present-day Venusian isotope ratios are shown in Figs. 4
and 5. In Fig. 4 the proto-Venus example shows a moderate rotator/0.8rmax
case with 0.38% H and the Venus example a moderate rotator/0.7rmax case
with 0.556% of H. Note that such H envelopes can be removed using more
sophisticated hydrodynamic escape models within similar timescales (John-
stone et al., 2015b). For a slow rotator, Fig. 5 shows cases of 0.8rmax
with 0.12% H (proto-Venus) and 0.7rmax with initially 0.25% of H (com-
plete Venus). The isotope ratios are normalized to the present values of
20Ne/22Ne = 11.9 ± 0.7 and 36Ar/38Ar = 5.45 ± 0.1 (Gillmann et al., 2009)
and the measurement uncertainties are indicated by dashed lines of the same
color as the corresponding modeled ratios. Generally we ﬁnd that for faster
rotating stars (i.e. higher EUV ﬂux levels) more H from the nebula is re-
quired to produce the desired isotope ratios, similar to the scenario with pure
steam atmospheres. The valid solutions we ﬁnd all lie in a very restricted
parameter space which does not allow us to select a most favorable case.
However, since we ﬁnd at least some possible range in almost every evolution
history, this indicates that it is likely that thermal escape of a remnant ac-
creted nebula atmosphere is a likely cause of the presently observed isotope
ratios on Venus. This also indicates that it is possible that a suﬃciently large
proto-Venus was already formed when the nebula was still present. A similar
scenario has been suggested for Earth where Xe isotopes may be explained
by an accreted protoatmosphere which was mixed into the upper regions of
the mantle (Becker et al., 2003).

Note that we are not able to reproduce Venus’ present 20Ne/36Ar abun-
dance ratio if initially starting from solar abundances, which always remains
close to solar. It has been recognized in a previous application of such a model
to Mars that it is not possible to obtain this abundance ratio simultaneous
with the isotope ratios starting from solar values (Zahnle et al., 1990). If
aiming to reproduce this ratio, the isotope ratios would be overfractionated.
This is discussed in more detail in Section 5.

The impact history has some inﬂuence on the required nebula H and
timescales, but not on the general conclusion that hydrodynamic escape can
lead to the presently observed noble gas isotope ratios. We also compare
a Venus case without a steam atmosphere and only H from the nebula to
evaluate the inﬂuence of the presence of the steam atmosphere at t0. We
also ﬁnd parameter ranges which may reproduce the presently observed iso-
tope ratios. The time at which H is lost is comparable to the case with
an added steam atmosphere; however, small diﬀerences occur for smaller r0

23

and a slowly rotating host star. The required H at t0 is higher than for the
steam+nebula case, which is clear since the amount of atmosphere needed to
obtain the ﬁnal isotope ratios must be comparable for ﬁxed stellar evolution
tracks. This indicates that the results are not strongly dependent on the
assumed steam atmosphere, since no steam simply raises the required nebula
H at t0. Another important aspect is that both Ne and Ar isotope ratios
reach the present-day ranges at roughly similar times for all cases, indicating
that hydrodynamic escape is a likely cause of the observed fractionation of
these noble gas isotopes.

It is important to note that the numbers given in Table 2 are only valid
for T0 = 300 K, which is the adopted equilibrium temperature at the orbit
of Venus. There is some dependence on the choice of the temperature (cf.
also Gillmann et al., 2009). Increasing T0 leads to more eﬃcient dragging
because this increases xj,k (cf. Eqs. 4 and 5), and therefore also Fj,k. The H
amounts required to reach valid isotope ratio ranges therefore increases, as
do the corresponding loss times.

If a steam atmosphere was already present at t0 and mixed with residual
H, our results indicate that a slow rotator and/or smaller r0 produce favorable
results because otherwise too much CO2 would escape. However, if the out-
gassing occurred later when the nebula atmosphere was suﬃciently tenuous
the isotope ratios could possibly also be reproduce via mixing the fraction-
ated residual H with a newly outgassed steam atmosphere and subsequent
escape thereof, provided that the host star remains active for a suﬃciently
long time.

From the results in Table 2, one can see that the remaining CO2 contents
are rather low which restricts possible scenarios further. There are several
ways in which substantial loss of CO2 could be mitigated. The modeling
results point towards rather low H contents at t0, small r0, as well as a
low-activity host star. Furthermore, since the results are shown for CO2
remaining in molecular form which makes escape less eﬃcient, a high fraction
of dissociated CO2 is also unlikely. Since being exposed to the strong EUV
ﬂuxes of a rapidly rotating star CO2 is very likely to be dissociated in the
escape region; this also suggests that the young Sun had a low level of activity,
corresponding to it being a slow rotator. Another possibility is that the
ﬁrst outgassed steam atmosphere was more massive and had CO2 contents
(cid:29)100 bar. We made some tests with a more massive 770 bar (PH2O =
630 bar, PCO2 = 140 bar) steam atmosphere. In the proto-Venus case with a
moderate rotator and r0 = rmin, about 60 bar CO2 are left when the isotope

24

ratios reach present values and for 0.8rmax, 30 bar remain. For a slow rotator
and 0.8rmax, 50 bar are left. These results indicate that simply raising the
amount of CO2 at t0 by a certain amount does not lead to residual CO2
pressures higher by the same amount, but by a lower value. Note that H
contents diﬀerent from those of Table 2 had to be added to reach present
isotope ratios.

A further solution could be that more CO2 was delivered later by impacts.
In this case, the impactors would have had to have kept their volatiles until
the time that they impacted with the planet; one way they could have done
this is by being small enough to not have a magma ocean, so that the volatiles
would only be released from the body during the impact. According to
Elkins-Tanton and Seager (2008) and Elkins-Tanton (2011) more than 85%
of the H2O and more than 90% of the CO2 contents of a magma ocean
are degassed into the atmosphere on an Earth-mass planet. However, if
either the magma ocean did not involve the entire mantle and/or was not
global, a large volatile fraction could have been retained in the interior, even
if almost the whole volatile content of the magma ocean is degassed upon
solidiﬁcation. This eﬀect could also inhibit the eﬃcient volatile loss from
smaller embryos discussed in Section 3. This indicates that since the initial
magma ocean, if it was global and deep, releases most of its volatiles the
crucial point is likely the time when this occurs. It is also possible that the
initial outgassing only occurred after most H was already gone since the large
surface pressures of the nebula-accreted atmosphere could have prevented
degassing and kept the surface temperatures at suﬃciently high levels that
the magma ocean solidiﬁcation was delayed. The delayed outgassing would
mean that by the time the steam atmosphere formed, the Sun’s EUV emission
could have already decayed to lower values and there would be less H present
to drag CO2 with it. A late veneer of chondritic material, similar as suggested
for Earth, could have provided additional volatiles at 70–140 Myr (Albar`ede,
2009). However, if in this scenario also 1–2 Earth oceans of water were
delivered, it is possible that large amounts of oxygen could have remained
on the planet. Some amount of CO2 could also have been outgassed over
geologically long times via volcanism.

Another issue in this context is the timescale of atmospheric loss. While
it is essentially unconstrained at Venus, we know that Earth already had
liquid water on its surface at an age of 200–300 Myr (Mojzsis et al., 2001),
indicating atmospheric pressures much lower than those of massive protoat-
mospheres. Since both planets may have had a broadly similar evolution,

this would indicate that timescales of < 300 Myr for the loss of any type of
massive protoatmosphere are favored. For instance, the scenario shown in the
left panel of Fig. 5 would be consistent with such an evolution. The missing
CO2 would have to be degassed later by resurfacing events, super-volcanism,
or delivered by impacts. One can see from Table 2 that low H contents at
200–300 Myr occur only in 2–3 scenarios.
In scenarios with longer atmo-
spheric loss timescales and moderate CO2 loss, the partial surface pressures
of H exceed a few 100 bar at this age. Hydrogen may also have an impor-
tant contribution to the greenhouse eﬀect (Pierrehumbert and Gaidos, 2011;
Wordsworth, 2012) which may keep surface temperatures high for extended
timescales.

Late accretion

If a body of 0.7MVenus was already assembled during the circumstellar gas
disk phase, it would have accreted some residual gas and started its evolu-
tion most likely with a dense H-dominated protoatmosphere, as discussed in
Section 4.1. The question remains if cooling, solidiﬁcation and subsequent
volatile degassing of a magma ocean would take place if the atmospheric
pressure of an accreted H atmosphere is non-negligible. Since such a proto-
Venus would require longer timescales to lose a hydrogen envelope due to its
higher gravity than e.g. Mars-like bodies (Erkaev et al., 2014), outgassing
may occur at a later time. However, there exists the alternative possibility
that Venus formed late (at 50–100 Myr) from the assembly of several plane-
tary embryos. In the late accretion scenario, Venus is expected to be formed
within 70 Myr from collisions between large planetary embryos and planetes-
imals where the building blocks all remained smaller than or comparable to
Mars within the nebula. We estimate this starting point by assuming that
Venus should have been fully formed at a time comparable to the Moon-
forming impact at Earth, which is dated between 50 and 150 Myr (Halliday,
2000; Connelly and Bizzarro, 2016), with recent studies pointing towards
∼60 Myr (Barboni et al., 2017).

We aim to test if the present isotope ratios could also be reproduced
in such a scenario. We start our calculations at 70 Myr and assume that
at this point, the formation of Venus (1MVenus, 1RVenus) has ﬁnished and
that its initial magma ocean has solidiﬁed and degassed its volatile contents.
However, we do not put constraints on the possible amounts of volatiles
here because the planetary embryos from which the planet formed may have
already (partly) lost their volatile inventories, depending on when (or if) they
were outgassed and how much of the total content was involved. Moreover,
a late veneer may have delivered additional volatiles. Thus we only aim to
ﬁnd possible atmospheric amounts and compositions which would allow the
reproduction of current isotope ratios and discuss the possible existence of
the resulting atmospheres in succeeding cases.

For a starting time of t0 = 70 Myr, we ﬁnd no valid solutions for the
slow rotator track. The EUV ﬂuxes in this scenario are already so low that
both Ne and Ar are not dragged with the ﬂow. In case of a moderate rota-
tor, the present 20Ne/22Ne can be reproduced in some cases, but Ar is only
fractionated up to 85 Myr, which is too short so that the present 36Ar/38Ar
isotope ratio is never reached. We can only ﬁnd valid solutions for the fast
rotator case. Assuming that all CO2 is present in molecular form, the ﬁnal

29

isotope ratios lie within present ranges for 5000–6000 bar H2O and 110 bar
CO2. The CO2 content is in this case not so important; it was chosen mainly
such that the ﬁnal CO2 pressure remains about 90 bar. Massive water en-
velopes are necessary in order to provide H for a suﬃciently long time to
reach present isotope ratios. In case of completely dissociated CO2, which
is a likely scenario for a fast rotator, the range of possible atmospheric pres-
sures is 4700–5800 bar H2O. The corresponding CO2 contents have to be
raised to 350 and 270 bar, respectively, again mainly chosen to leave about
90–100 bar of CO2 on the planet. The choice of CO2 is more sensitive in this
case because atomic C is dragged with the ﬂow easier.

The inﬂuence of assuming a higher temperature is not very strong, but
it keeps the Ne ratio slightly higher and lowers Ar for otherwise similar
conditions. Higher T0 also requires a raised CO2 content because it escapes
more eﬃciently. Figure 6 shows the example of a 5610 bar (PH2O = 5500 bar,
PCO2 = 110 bar) atmosphere with CO2 molecules and a 5320 bar (PH2O =
5000 bar, PCO2 = 320 bar) atmosphere with dissociated CO2, both for a fast
rotator. Such massive atmospheres are, however, very unlikely to be degassed
from a Venus-mass planet (Elkins-Tanton and Seager, 2008), especially in
view of the likely drier large building blocks at Venus’ orbit. Moreover, huge
remnant O envelopes of about 1000 bar would also remain, if they were not
completely oxidized in the hot surface. Therefore, present-day isotope ratios
of Venus are unlikely to be caused only by escape of a steam atmosphere in
a scenario where the planet accretes late.

5. Discussion

5.1. Limitations and assumptions of the escape model

The escape rates, and therefore atmospheric loss timescales, are inﬂu-
enced by our assumptions. Here we discuss them in more detail. Moreover,
we test parameter variations for one reference case of a Mars-like embryo
with a 96 bar atmosphere at the orbit of Earth for a moderate rotator.

5.1.1. Heating and mass-loss eﬃciencies

We adopt a heating eﬃciency of 15% which is typical for hydrogen-
dominated atmospheres (Shematovich et al., 2014), but similar values were
also used in other water loss studies (Kasting and Pollack, 1983; Chasseﬁ`ere,
1996b; Tian, 2015). Raising η by a factor of two to 30%, like commonly

and therefore shortens the loss timescale by the same value.

By assuming that the atmospheric escape is energy-limited (Eq. 2) we
may also overestimate the escape rates if a non-negligible part of the energy
provided by EUV absorption also increases the temperature and outﬂow
velocity of the atmosphere (Erkaev et al., 2015). Salz et al. (2016) deter-
mined an evaporation eﬃciency factor, ηeva = ˙Msim/ ˙Mel, the ratio of the
mass-loss rate from hydrodynamic simulations to the energy-limited rate (cf.
Eq. 2). From a study of early Mars (Erkaev et al., 2014) we ﬁnd that for
a H-dominated atmosphere at 100 EUV, ηeva∼0.2−0.3 with the lower value
for η = 40% and the higher for 15%. For O-dominated atmospheres (Ap-
pendix Appendix A), however, ηeva∼0.2−0.8 and strongly depends on η and
FEUV, where larger ηeva is found for smaller values of these parameters. Due
to the large scatter of these estimates we do not correct for this factor in our
model. Introducing ηeva could therefore reduce the escape rates by up to a
factor of ﬁve and lengthen the atmospheric loss timescales correspondingly.

5.1.2. r0 and rEUV

By setting β = rEUV/r0 = 1 we tend to underestimate the escape rates.
Erkaev et al. (2014) applied a hydrodynamic model to the upper atmosphere
of an early Mars with an accreted hydrogen envelope. For pure H and an
EUV ﬂux enhanced by a factor 100 compared to the present solar value,
they found that β is 3–4 depending on the assumed r0 and η. On the other
hand, for pure O atmospheres (Appendix Appendix A) we ﬁnd that β ≈ 1.5
and almost independent on η or FEUV. Thus, the actual β for a mixed
atmosphere likely lies between these two extremes, indicating that we may
underestimate the escape rates by about a factor of two. However, since
rEUV should also depend on the assumed wavelength of the EUV emission
and corresponding photoionization cross-section in our gray model due to the
wavelength-dependent penetration depth of the high-energy radiation, a more
complex model would be required to determine β more reliably. Additionally,
the mass-loss rate depends on r0, which should also change with time in an
escaping atmosphere. If the Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction timescale is short
compared to the mass-loss timescale, r0 should decrease with time due to
decreasing atmospheric mass, leading us to overestimate the escape rates at
later evolutionary stages. On the other hand, if escape is very eﬃcient and
the atmosphere cannot adjust itself quickly enough, r0 may also increase
with time, leading to even more vigorous escape and the complete loss of the

32

atmosphere. We test the inﬂuence of r0 and β for the reference case. The
assumed mesopause height of 1000 km should be representative for the initial
conditions of a steam atmosphere above a molten magma ocean after the
models of Marcq (2012), but could be overestimated at later stages when the
atmosphere has already partly escaped and/or the surface temperatures have
decreased. To test the eﬀect we run the calculations for 500 km and 100 km.
We ﬁnd that the atmosphere is lost at 15 (17) Myr for 500 (100) km compared
to 13.5 Myr for the reference case. On the other hand, if setting β = 2
(intermediate between pure O and pure H atmospheres; Appendix Appendix
A) reduces the atmospheric loss timescale by a factor of four compared to
the reference case.

5.1.3. Mixing ratio in the escape region

Atmospheric mixing ratios are calculated by assuming that the atmo-
spheric species are well mixed in the escape region. This requires the as-
sumption that the stellar EUV ﬂux reaches close to the homopause level so
that diﬀusive separation below the escape region is negligible. Since the in-
creasing temperature in the outﬂow region increases the molecular diﬀusion
coeﬃcients, it is likely that the base of the ﬂow and the homopause level
are located at similar altitudes. If, however, diﬀusive separation may occur
well below the EUV-heated escape region, the actual mixing ratios could be
lower. The total escape rates would not be aﬀected (if we ignore that η may
change), but the escape ﬂuxes of the heavier constituents relative to H would
be reduced. This means that whereas the O escape rate is 50% that of H as-
suming fO = 0.5, it would be 10% that of H assuming fO = 0.1 etc., since for
our considered Mars-like objects xO is always close to 1, i.e. drag is eﬃcient.
At a given total escape rate this would mean that H escapes more eﬃciently
whereas less O is dragged with the ﬂow if the actual mixing ratios are much
lower than the maximum. Especially CO2 could in such a case be present
in the escape region in much smaller amounts due to its large mass, leading
to less eﬃcient removal. However, models of hot steam atmospheres indicate
that such atmospheres are likely well mixed up to large heights (Abe and
Matsui, 1988; Kasting, 1988; Marcq, 2012). Lupu et al. (2014) studied the
atmosphere of an Earth-like planet after a giant impact and found that it is
dominated by H2O and CO2. Moreover, both constituents have almost con-
stant mixing ratios up to large heights, if vertical mixing and photochemistry
are taken into account. Therefore, it is likely that our assumptions about the
mixing ratios at r0 are valid for such atmospheres. However, a self-consistent

33

treatment of the connection between the lower and upper atmosphere would
be desirable and should be addressed in future studies.

According to Zahnle et al. (1990), the fractionation factor of the heavy
major species (Eq. 4) can also be written as xj = 1 − Fdiﬀ/Fi, where Fdiﬀ is
the diﬀusion-limited escape ﬂux of the light species. As long as Fi > Fdiﬀ,
the outﬂow of the light species is given by Eq. 6 and drags along species j.
Fi < Fdiﬀ would yield xj < 0, i.e. Fj = 0. In this case, the outﬂow of i
would not be energy-limited, but diﬀusion-limited and given by Fdiﬀ, which
is signiﬁcantly lower. For Mars-like embryos, this situation never occurs in
the early evolutionary stages, because of their low gravities and the high
stellar EUV ﬂuxes. Moreover, we show in Appendix Appendix A that even
an O-dominated atmosphere could escape hydrodynamically from such bod-
ies. For proto-Venus, however, this situation may occur at later evolutionary
stages. We also ﬁnd that the negligible escape of CO2 under most conditions
leads to its accumulation. We do not continue the calculations if this situ-
ation occurs. However, since we are mainly interested to ﬁnd the times at
which the noble gas isotope ratios reach their present-day values (and remain
constant thereafter), which occurs if both components of the ratio are not
dragged anymore, we do not attempt to calculate the further evolution of
the atmospheres. Since both Ne, Ar, and their considered isotopes are heav-
ier than O, the latter still escapes with H during the relevant time period.
Therefore, transition to diﬀusion-limited escape does not aﬀect the conclu-
sions from this study, but may become relevant if aiming to investigate the
long-term evolution of Venus’ early atmosphere.

5.1.4. Atmospheric temperature

We assume a temperature (entering the binary diﬀusion parameters) simi-
lar to the equilibrium temperatures at the respective orbits. This is consistent
with the steam atmosphere model of Marcq (2012) and its updated version
(Massol et al., 2016), which predicts similar mesopause temperatures even
above hot molten planetary surfaces. Adopting the temperature T0 = T (r0)
for the calculations can be justiﬁed by inspecting Eq. 3. Conservation of
mass requires that the escape rate F r2 is constant with height, which means
that the product fjxj must also be constant with height. Since we set fj
to fj(r0) this requires setting xj = xj(r0) and thus T = T0. However, the
simple analytic description of the escape ﬂuxes of the dragged species is de-
rived assuming isothermal conditions and dfj/dr = 0 (Zahnle et al., 1990),
so it could be partly an artifact of these simpliﬁcations. On the other hand,

34

the situation could also be interpreted as using a mean fj (which is ∼ fj(r0)
because it is roughly constant in an eﬃciently escaping upper atmosphere)
and a mean xj (i.e., a mean T ) of the upper atmosphere. The mean T in the
upper atmosphere would be higher because of heating by EUV absorption.
Therefore, we tested the inﬂuence of this choice by using temperatures up to
a few 1000 K, but ﬁnd an negligible eﬀect on the atmospheric loss timescales.
The main eﬀect is that CO2 escapes more eﬃciently so that cases where CO2
would accumulate are often circumvented and the evolution can be calculated
up to higher ages. However, for atmospheres escaping eﬃciently already at
low T , the timescales remain the same. Note that we use the present-day
equilibrium temperatures which are slightly overestimated for the young ages
considered here because the pre-main sequence Sun with an age ≥10 Myr had
a lower luminosity than today. However, even a factor of two change in stellar
luminosity would result in a change of Teq by only about 50 K, which does
not aﬀect our results. The choice of temperature has a stronger impact on
fractionation than on general atmospheric escape. Note that Gillmann et al.
(2009) could only reproduce the isotope fractionation patterns of Venus for
restricted temperature ranges with their model.

5.1.5. Escape process

Our model may underestimate the mass-loss rates in case the escape is
not mainly EUV-driven and thus cannot be described by Eq. 2. For young
objects with extended atmospheres, “boil-oﬀ” driven by energy released from
the gravitational contraction of the gas envelope and the stellar bolometric
luminosity can yield escape rates orders of magnitude higher than those re-
sulting from stellar EUV irradiation (Owen and Wu, 2016; Ginzburg et al.,
2016). For low-gravity bodies, the atmospheres can also be removed by the
rocky core’s internal heat alone, independent of stellar irradiation, similar to
the process removing accreted envelopes when the gas disk dissipates (St¨okl
et al., 2015, 2016). A relevant parameter in this context is the Jeans es-
cape parameter λ = GM µmH/(kT r), where low values of λ indicate eﬃcient
escape. Since this is especially crucial for hot low-gravity objects, we did
not model planetary embryos smaller than Mars. Consider e.g. a Moon-like
body with an outgassed steam atmosphere. At the body’s surface, the es-
cape parameter for H2O is ∼20–30 for the equilibrium temperature range of
200–300 K. However, if the surface is still hot and molten, it would reduce to
1.5–4 for surface temperatures of 1500–4000 K (Lebrun et al., 2013), compa-
rable to the critical value where escape can become extremely high (Levi and

35

Podolak, 2009; Erkaev et al., 2015). The critical value for λ in the case of a
H2O-dominated atmosphere is about 4 (since γ = 1.33 and λcrit = γ/(γ − 1);
e.g. Massol et al., 2016) which indicates that water vapor is likely to be lost
immediately after outgassing without building up an atmosphere, depending
on the surface temperature of the magma ocean. The heavier CO2 may build
up an atmosphere, and as the surface cools, some build-up of steam may also
be possible. However, due to the low gravity, also EUV-driven escape is much
more eﬃcient and these small atmospheres may be removed rather quickly.
Direct escape of the steam atmosphere due to the hot molten surface is much
less eﬃcient for a more massive Mars-type body and irrelevant for full-grown
planets like Earth.

5.1.6. Start time

We set a starting time of 10 Myr for our calculations under the assump-
tion that the nebula gas has already disappeared from the considered orbital
locations and a magma ocean exists and has outgassed its volatile inven-
tory. It is, however, possible that these processes occur a few Myr earlier or
later. Circumstellar disks typically disappear between 1–10 Myr (Montmerle
et al., 2006; Hillenbrand, 2008), after which previously embedded embryos
or protoplanets are exposed to the stellar EUV ﬂux. Therefore, the eﬀect of
a diﬀerent starting time lies mainly in lengthening/shortening the object’s
exposure to the saturated EUV emission (cf. Section 2.1), depending on the
rotational evolution of the host star. In the saturation regime, the timescale
for atmospheric loss remains the same because the EUV ﬂux at a given orbit
is roughly constant, only the system age at which the object loses its envelope
shifts accordingly. Note that for the slow rotator evolution the saturation
time is very short (∼ 6 Myr) so that this evolution scenario is aﬀected most.

5.1.7. Orbits

Planetary embryos likely have eccentric orbits due to dynamic interac-
tions with other embryos, protoplanets, or gas giants (Lunine et al., 2011;
Raymond et al., 2014). However, we assumed circular orbits with ﬁxed semi-
major axes for our calculations, yielding ﬂux modulations only from stellar
evolution. The orbit-averaged ﬂux received by an object on an eccentric orbit
scales as (1 − e2)−1/2 (e.g. Dressing et al., 2010) and is therefore larger than
for a circular orbit, therefore we may underestimate the escape rates and
overestimate the corresponding timescales for atmospheric loss. Moreover,

36

non-zero eccentricity leads to tidal heating which may prolong the magma
ocean phases (Zahnle et al., 2007).

5.1.8. Collisions

In our calculations we assume that atmospheric escape takes place on
an isolated object without any external disturbances (except for Section 4.1
where we allow impacts to add mass to the core). However, in a young form-
ing planetary system, collisions between embryos or with planetesimals and
protoplanets are common, since this leads to the formation of larger terres-
trial planets in timescales of 50–100 Myr (Raymond et al., 2014). Collisions
could either provide new volatile-rich material or remove parts of an existing
steam atmosphere (Genda and Abe, 2003, 2005). Recent studies indicate
that direct atmospheric erosion by an impact has a minor eﬀect compared to
the energy deposition leading to melting and subsequent degassing (Gillmann
et al., 2016). Moreover, large impacts which occur on timescales of 5–10 Myr
(Lebrun et al., 2013) could lead to new magma ocean phases, triggering new
episodes of outgassing. However, since the initial magma ocean degasses 70–
99% of its volatile inventory (Elkins-Tanton, 2008), later steam atmospheres
are likely much more tenuous. Frequent collisions with small bodies could
keep the surface molten and delay condensation of an outgassed steam atmo-
sphere (Lebrun et al., 2013; Maindl et al., 2015). Therefore the condensation
timescales indicated in Figs. 1 and 2 are likely underestimated.

Note that for the proto-Venus evolution scenarios we also neglected impact-
induced atmospheric loss. This can occur via the impact shock wave and/or
enhanced hydrodynamic losses due to the increased temperatures from the
released impact energy (Massol et al., 2016, and references therein). In the
former case, an Earth-like planet loses about 10% of its atmosphere, whereas
a Mars-like impactor loses about 30%, so that roughly 70% of the impactor’s
atmosphere is delivered to the planet (Genda and Abe, 2003, 2005). More-
over, impacts may (partially) melt the surface of a protoplanet, leading to a
new magma ocean phase with outgassing from the interior. At Venus’ orbit
the magma ocean phase is expected to last for at least 10 Myr (Lebrun et al.,
2013) up to ≥ 100 Myr (Hamano et al., 2013), larger than our assumed time
interval between large impacts.

Atmospheric escape induced by impacts leads most likely only to loss
without altering these patterns (Canup and Righter, 2000; Mikhail and Sver-
jensky, 2014), but if the accreted embryos are already fractionated this may
inﬂuence the ﬁnal planet’s patterns. Moreover, we assume that the Mars-like

37

embryos degassed their volatile inventories and lost their complete atmo-
spheres previously (this is likely valid at the orbit of Venus, cf. Section 3).
Then only the rocky material adds to the core and increases the protoplanet’s
gravity. Another possibility would be that Mars-like embryos could add
an existing (possibly pre-fractionated) outgassed atmosphere upon impact.
However, since the timescales for complete atmospheric loss from these ob-
jects is small compared to the typical time between large impacts on proto-
planets (cf. Figs. 1, 2), especially at the orbit of Venus, very massive out-
gassed atmospheres and/or very eccentric orbits which bring the embryo close
to Venus’ orbit only at perihelion would be required to supply a signiﬁcant
amount of atmosphere to the protoplanet which may alter its fractionation
patterns.

5.1.9. EUV evolution and wind of the young Sun

In terms of EUV evolution, the present study considers the full range
of possible conditions around the young Sun and solar-like stars in general.
It is unknown if our Sun was once a fast or a slow rotator (or some case
in between). Observations indicate a large spread (more than an order of
magnitude) of possible activity levels between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr for a solar-
mass star at a given age (Tu et al., 2015). Hence, it is important to explore
the full range of possible solar EUV histories, also for other Sun-like stars.
The results of the embryo evolution, as well as the proto-Venus scenario,
indicate a strong dependence on these assumptions. For the Mars-like embryo
diﬀerences occur only between the slow and other activity levels because of
the short atmospheric loss times which lie within the saturation period of
the moderate and fast rotator tracks. The atmosphere is lost a few Myr
earlier in the latter cases. Concerning fractionation of noble gases on Venus,
all evolution tracks exhibit diﬀerent results because the patterns can only be
reproduced considering timescales much longer than the saturation time.

Previous studies on isotope fractionation or water loss on early Venus
(Chasseﬁ`ere, 1997; Gillmann et al., 2009) assumed a dense stellar wind (up
to 103 − 104 denser than now; Chasseﬁ`ere, 1997) from the young Sun which
contributed signiﬁcantly to the modeled fractionation patterns due to ad-
ditional energy input. However, more recent models of the winds of young
Sun-like stars (Johnstone et al., 2015a) suggests that they were much more
tenuous than previously expected. The resulting energy input into planetary
atmospheres by production of energetic neutral atoms is thus not very eﬃ-
cient and the stellar EUV luminosity is the dominant driver of atmospheric

38

escape (Lichtenegger et al., 2016).

5.2. Water loss

The short timescales found for the loss of water from catastrophically out-
gassed steam atmospheres on Mars-like embryos, especially for orbits smaller
than Earth’s and a moderate or fast rotator, suggests that planets formed
from such (or even lower mass) bodies could have been drier than previ-
ously expected. The volatile amount these embryos are able to contribute to
growing protoplanets will depend crucially on the timescales of planet forma-
tion, since the shorter the embryos are exposed to the stellar EUV emission
the more volatiles can still be added to the protoplanets. Additionally, the
timescales of outgassing and the amount of outgassed material (global vs.
local magma oceans and their depths) will play a role because as long as
suﬃcient volatiles remain inside the embryo these can be delivered to a pro-
toplanet. Embryos smaller than Mars will be aﬀected more severely because
the atmospheric escape process is likely direct outﬂow due to the low grav-
ity and (suﬃciently) high surface temperature, similar to comets when they
approach perihelion (e.g. Hansen et al., 2016, and Section 5.1.5), and not
EUV-driven mass-loss.

5.3. Isotope ratios

Thermal escape is one possible cause of isotope fractionation observed in
present-day atmospheres of solar system objects. Previous studies already
aimed to explain presently observed isotope and/or noble gas fractionation of
the terrestrial planets by hydrodynamic escape (Sekiya et al., 1980; Hunten
et al., 1987; Sasaki and Nakazawa, 1988; Zahnle et al., 1990; Pepin, 1991;
Gillmann et al., 2009). Using up-to-date stellar activity evolution tracks we
explore, as an example, possible scenarios for the early evolution of Venus.
We ﬁnd cases for both a proto-Venus with impacts and a full Venus evo-
lution where we are able to reproduce currently observed noble gas isotope
ratios (20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/38Ar) if we assume that there is some residual H from
the protoplanetary nebula mixed into an early outgassed steam atmosphere.
Valid solutions are found for all stellar rotators and diﬀerent assumptions
about the planet’s atmospheric radius. However, the ranges in allowed pa-
rameter space are always rather small. Moreover, the time at which the whole
atmosphere is lost is often rather short (< 100 Myr) after the present-day
values are reached. If the atmosphere were completely lost, the current at-
mosphere and its fractionation pattern must result from other processes (e.g.

39

Owen et al., 1992; Halliday, 2013). Another possibility would be if the atmo-
spheric escape mechanism would transition to the less-eﬃcient Jeans escape
at about these system ages. For instance, Kasting and Pollack (1983) found
that if the partial pressure of water vapor decreases to 10 bar, the escape
rate drops signiﬁcantly. Moreover, scenarios with too eﬃcient loss of CO2
are unrealistic, making the cases with slower stellar rotation and/or smaller
atmospheric radii (corresponding also to smaller residual H envelopes) more
likely. Escape of a pure steam atmosphere in a late accretion scenario also
leads to valid solutions, but only for a fast rotator and in steam atmospheres
in excess of a few kbar.

Despite our ability to reproduce present isotope ratios of Ne and Ar at
similar times with our model, we are not able to reproduce the presently ob-
served abundance ratio 20Ne/36Ar of 0.5 ± 0.3 (Hoﬀman et al., 1979; Mikhail
and Sverjensky, 2014) in any scenario, which remains almost solar-like (∼39;
Halliday, 2013) in all cases. This ratio remains ≥ 30 in all scenarios although
the isotopes of the individual noble gases reach the present-day values. Hy-
drodynamic escape is not capable of reproducing both abundance and isotope
ratios at the same time if starting from solar values, in agreement with pre-
vious studies (Zahnle et al., 1990). Whereas the isotope ratios (20Ne/22Ne,
36Ar/38Ar) need to decrease by ∼10%, the abundance ratio would have to
decrease by a factor of ∼80 during similar timescales. This is clearly impos-
sible considering the masses of the elements and the mass-dependent frac-
tionation factors entering the escape ﬂuxes in our model. A starting value
of 20Ne/36Ar < 1 would be required. This suggests that the initial abun-
dances were likely not solar, as suggested e.g. by Halliday (2013) who favor
a mixing of chondritic and solar composition material. Pepin (1992) mention
that cometary ices have low Ne/Ar, so accretion of such cometary material
could be responsible for Venus’ low Ne/Ar ratio. Since the evolution of the
isotope ratios of a single element, however, is independent of the abundances,
our results would not change if diﬀerent element abundances at t0 were as-
sumed. Additional study of Kr or Xe isotopes would be valuable, though
they are unknown for Venus. The abundance ratio 84Kr/130Xe is also not
very well constrained for Venus, but a lower limit could be ∼100 (Halliday,
2013). Our model results are consistent with this limit in most of the cases
which reproduce Ne and Ar isotope ratios. Only for moderate and fast rota-
tors with dissociated CO2 does the Kr/Xe ratio become far too small. Also
temperatures above 500 K would produce too low Kr/Xe ratios. The results
of our model are in qualitative agreement with previous studies like Pepin

40

(1991) who stressed that the Venusian noble gas isotope ratios, as well as
abundances (except for Ne) are close to solar.

Aside from eﬃcient thermal escape, other processes may lead to isotope
fractionation. Genda and Abe (2005) modeled the atmospheric loss due to
impacts in the presence of oceans. They found that if a water ocean is present
on the surface, atmospheric losses due to impacts are enhanced. They argue
that since it is likely that an ocean was present on Earth, but not on Venus,
remnants of a noble gas-rich atmosphere may have survived on Venus, leading
to diﬀerent noble gas abundances on these planets. Although it is possible
that liquid water was already present at Earth during the ﬁrst ∼100 Myr,
it is important to note that impacts of small embryos and planetesimals
may have kept the planetary surfaces molten and the atmospheres in steam
form. In this context, Debaille et al. (2007) suggested, based on analysis of
Sm-Nd isotopes, that Mars had a magma ocean phase of about ∼100 Myr,
much longer than the timescales for water condensation estimated by Lebrun
et al. (2013) at this orbital distance (∼0.1 Myr), who neglected such frequent
impact heating events (Maindl et al., 2015). Thus, it could be possible that
Earth did not have oceans during the times of giant impacts yet, which would
lead to an evolution scenario similar to Venus in the model of Genda and Abe
(2005). Genda and Abe (2005) assume that the planets formed by accumu-
lation of several Mars-sized embryos, similar to our late-accretion scenario
for Venus. Whereas they assume that these embryos supply the growing
protoplanet with volatiles (aside from losses through the impacts), we found
that such bodies lose their steam atmospheres very quickly at the orbit of
Venus, and also at Earth’s. This means that these planets could have ac-
creted much drier than expected, if not suﬃcient bodies scattered from more
distant orbits were involved, which would then result in rather tenuous out-
gassed atmospheres. However, recent Solar System formation models based
on the “Grand Tack” hypothesis (Walsh et al., 2011; O’Brien et al., 2014)
indicate that early Venus and Earth most likely grew to 50–70% of their
masses already within the protoplanetary nebula. This would have lead to
accretion of gas envelopes of solar composition, which is in agreement with
isotope studies at Earth (Becker et al., 2003). These H2-dominated envelopes
would have to be removed by hydrodynamic escape until the surface pres-
sures would allow solidiﬁcation of the magma oceans and related outgassing
of steam atmospheres. Large impacts may have occurred before or after a
steam atmosphere was present, which would have aﬀected the composition
of the atmosphere in a diﬀerent way. In reality, both processes may work

41

together and determine the present atmospheric composition. Implementing
impact-related losses in our model is planned for the future and will be used
to study their eﬀect on the evolution of isotope ratios.

A related issue in this context is the enrichment of deuterium relative to
hydrogen. On Earth, D/H is comparable to chonditic material, but Genda
and Ikoma (2008) showed that measured values can also be obtained by ini-
tially assuming mixtures of chondritic and solar material. The D/H ratio
is then altered by evolutionary processes, such as surface exchange and at-
mospheric escape (Genda and Ikoma, 2008). Both Mars and Venus show
signiﬁcant enrichments of D (∼6 for Mars; ∼150 for Venus; Zahnle et al.,
1990) compared to Earth’s value, so it is argued that evolutionary aspects
must be responsible. Zahnle et al. (1990) found that the Martian value can
be reproduced with a wide range of initial values, as the outcome is very
sensitive to the assumed parameters in their escape model. Since D is only
marginally heavier than H, most studies argue that fractionation of D only
occurs at later stages of evolution when H escape ﬂuxes are low, because
during periods of eﬃcient hydrodynamic escape, D is also lost along with H,
leading to negligible enrichment. Hunten (1993) stressed that for an enrich-
ment of 150, like for Venus, the initial H content must have been at least
150 times higher than present, and even much higher if D escaped eﬃciently
with H during the ﬁrst tens to ∼100 Myr.

6. Conclusions

We studied the evolution of outgassed H2O/CO2 steam atmospheres from
planetary embryos due to EUV-driven hydrodynamic escape. Typical en-
velopes are lost in timescales of a few up to a few tens of Myr from Mars-
like bodies, depending on the amount of degassed atmosphere, the orbital
distance, and the detailed stellar activity evolution. For smaller Moon-mass
embryos, atmospheres may be lost much quicker due to their lower gravity, or
may not even accumulate at all. Depending on the typical timescales between
collisions of large planetary embryos, protoplanets forming via late accretion
may therefore be drier than expected. Our results indicate, in agreement
with the recent ﬁndings of Ru isotopic data in carbonaceous chondrite-like
asteroids by Fischer-G¨odde and Kleine (2017) and the “Grand Tack” hy-
pothesis (e.g. O’Brien et al., 2014), that the majority of volatiles should have
been delivered from the outer Solar System during the main stages of ter-
restrial planet formation, but not during late accretion. Moreover, smaller

42

planetesimals which did not experience magma oceans and fractionation also
may have delivered volatiles that remained in their interiors and have not
been outgassed before collisions. In this context, we investigate possible past
evolution scenarios of Venus. Isotope ratios can be used to constrain possi-
ble histories of atmospheric escape. Under the assumption of late formation,
present noble gas isotope ratios of Ne and Ar can only be reproduced if
the Sun was a fast rotator and an outgassed atmosphere of a few kbar was
present, which is unlikely. However, the present-day noble gas isotope ratios
can also be reproduced in an early formation scenario with a nebula-accreted
envelope for a variety of stellar EUV histories. The fast rotator case is the
most unlikely because CO2 would be lost too eﬃciently, inconsistent with the
present 90 bar atmosphere. This amount is unlikely to be delivered later by
large impacts because these objects should have lost their volatiles even more
easily. It is more likely that the Sun’s past evolution was in the range between
a slow and moderate rotator. Also, it is unlikely that CO2 was mainly dissoci-
ated since then it would also be lost too eﬃciently, further pointing towards a
young Sun with a low activity level. A combined scenario of nebula-accreted
material on a proto-Venus and magma ocean solidiﬁcation and outgassing at
a later time would also be an option, but this would depend strongly on the
timings of the events. Measurements of Xe could conﬁrm the early accretion
scenario; if it were Earth-like then this would indicate that formation of a
proto-Venus within the nebula was most likely. Therefore, in agreement with
the “Grand Tack” hypothesis, early Venus most likely grew to a mass inside
the nebula large enough such that it could capture a thin H2-envelope, which
was afterwards lost via EUV-driven hydrodynamic escape.

Appendix A. Hydrodynamic escape of oxygen from Mars-like em-

bryos

Equations 2 and 6 are only valid when the main species in the upper
atmosphere experiences eﬃcient hydrodynamic escape so that the energy-
limited equation approximates the mass-loss rates suﬃciently well. For light
species, such as atomic H, previous studies showed that Mars- and Earth-
mass planets which are exposed to EUV ﬂuxes enhanced by a factor of >25
compared to that of the present Earth will experience hydrodynamic expan-
sion and escape conditions (e.g. Watson et al., 1981; Zahnle and Kasting,
1986; Zahnle et al., 1990; Chasseﬁ`ere, 1996a; Tian et al., 2009; Erkaev et al.,
2013, 2014; Luger and Barnes, 2015; Tian and Ida, 2015; Tian, 2015). For
lower EUV ﬂuxes, H2 remains mainly in molecular form (Yelle, 2004; Tian
et al., 2005a; Koskinen et al., 2010; Erkaev et al., 2013). Due to the high
levels of stellar EUV emission during the ﬁrst 50–100 Myr when embryos
may still be present in a system, Eq. 6 is likely valid if hydrogen is the main
species in the embryo’s upper atmosphere.

However, in cases where escape is very eﬃcient the amount of hydrogen
decreases fast so that atomic oxygen accumulates and may become the main
species. At least partly, some oxygen may be removed by oxidation of the
surface (Gillmann et al., 2009). However, for very high stellar EUV ﬂuxes
atomic oxygen may also escape hydrodynamically from low-gravity bodies
like embryos and could potentially even drag along other heavy species, such
as CO2. To study this scenario we apply a 1-D hydrodynamic upper atmo-
sphere model which takes into account heating by absorption of stellar EUV
radiation. This model is described in detail in the appendix of Erkaev et al.
(2016). We apply it to a Mars-like planetary embryo assuming an oxygen-
dominated upper atmosphere to evaluate under which EUV ﬂux levels such
an atmosphere could escape hydrodynamically.

The model of Erkaev et al. (2016) uses a wavelength-integrated EUV
ﬂux and does not consider the spectral dependence of the incoming stellar
EUV radiation. We use an average atomic O photoabsorption cross-section
of 10−17 cm2 which is representative for the wavelength range of 150–900 ˚A
(Fennelly and Torr, 1992). We set the lower boundary at the mesopause
level at a radius of r0 = 4390 km. Above this level, the bulk of the EUV
photons is absorbed and very little penetrates below it. We assume an oxygen
number density at the r0 level of 5×1012 cm−3 (typical homopause density; cf.
Erkaev et al., 2013) and a temperature T0 corresponding to the equilibrium

results at the orbit of Mars where we have adopted T0 = 200 K (Marcq, 2012).
The upper boundary of the calculation domain was set to 6 r0, where we
assume outﬂow conditions. We present the results for two heating eﬃciencies,
15% (as for H) and 30% (as for O2; Tian and Ida, 2015). The resulting
atmospheric proﬁles of temperature, velocity, number density and volume
heating rate are shown in Fig. A.7 for three diﬀerent EUV ﬂux levels (see
below) and two heating eﬃciencies.

In Table A.3, we summarize the hydrodynamic modeling results for a
Mars-like embryo at the orbit of Mars exposed to EUV ﬂuxes from a young

mately 30, 100 and 500 times higher than at present in the wavelength range
20–920 ˚A Ribas et al., 2005). Since the hydrodynamic equations are only
valid for densities suﬃciently high so that frequent collisions occur, the so-
lutions are only considered to be valid if the outﬂow reaches the sonic point
well below the exobase. We ﬁnd that the sonic point lies above the exobase
for case Ia, so the escape rate should be more comparable to a (modiﬁed)
Jeans rate and the upper atmosphere structure obtained with the hydrody-
namic model is uncertain. For cases Ib, IIa, and IIb, the sonic point lies
below the exobase, but the Knudsen number, which is the number where
hydrodynamic and kinetic models start to deviate (Volkov et al., 2011), is
much higher than 0.1. Only for cases IIIa and b (the highest EUV ﬂux level)
the Knudsen number at the sonic point is suﬃciently close to 0.1 so that
these cases can be considered hydrodynamic blow-oﬀ. By comparing with
the energy-limited escape rate we ﬁnd that it approximates the hydrody-
namically calculated rates better for low EUV ﬂuxes and heating eﬃciencies,
whereas it is up to a factor of ﬁve higher for high EUV ﬂuxes. This ﬁnding
is similar to Johnson et al. (2013). The results shown in Table A.3 indicate
that even heavy, O-dominated atmospheres can escape from Mars-like em-
bryos if exposed to the high EUV ﬂuxes of young stars because of their low
gravity. Since the results shown are for Mars’ orbit only, it is obvious that for
closer orbits hydrodynamic escape of O would even be more eﬃcient because
of the even higher EUV ﬂux levels. Therefore, it is justiﬁed to assume that
outgassed steam atmospheres around Mars-like embryos at orbital locations
spanning the HZ of the Sun are easily lost within a few to a few tens of Myr,
regardless of their exact compositions and masses.
