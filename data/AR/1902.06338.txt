We compare the predictions of the SuSAv2 model including two-particle two-hole meson-exchange
currents with the recent JLab data for inclusive electron scattering on three diﬀerent targets (C,
Ar and Ti). The agreement is very good over the full energy spectrum, with some discrepancy
seen only in the deep inelastic region. The 2p2h response, peaked in the dip region between the
quasielastic and ∆-resonance peak, is essential to reproduce the data. We also analyze the kF
(Fermi momentum) dependence of the data in terms of scaling of second kind, showing that the
2p2h response scales very diﬀerently from the quasielastic one, in full accord with what is predicted
by the model. The results represent a valuable test of the applicability of the model to neutrino
scattering processes on diﬀerent nuclei.

The precise description of electron scattering data on
complex nuclei is not only interesting by itself, but also of
crucial importance in connection with current and future
neutrino oscillation experiments [1–8], which aim at mea-
suring the leptonic CP violation phase, δCP , assessing the
neutrino mass hierarchy and improving the precision on
the oscillation mixing angles. A few percent uncertainty
in the description of neutrino-nucleus interactions occur-
ring in the detectors of these experiments, typically com-
posed of argon, water or mineral oil, is needed in order
to meet the required precision in the experimental anal-
yses (see [9, 10] for recent reviews of this subject). The
importance of validating diﬀerent nuclear models using
high quality electron scattering data in the relevant en-
ergy domain has been often stressed [11–16] and careful
comparisons have been performed with the carbon and
oxygen data collected in the QES archive [17]. The recent
measurement of Ar(e, e′)X and Ti(e, e′)X cross sections
performed at Jeﬀerson Lab [18, 19] oﬀers a new opportu-
nity to test nuclear models [20–23] in a kinematic region
and on nuclei that are speciﬁcally relevant for neutrino
oscillation experiments.

In [24] it was ﬁrst suggested that the superscaling prop-
erties of inclusive (e, e′) data represent a powerful tool to
connect electron- and neutrino-scattering reactions. De-
tailed studies of scaling and superscaling for electron-
nucleus cross sections have been presented in [25–27].
The analysis of the (e, e′) world data has shown the qual-
ity of the scaling behavior: scaling of the ﬁrst kind (no
dependence on the momentum transfer) is quite good at
excitation energies below the QE peak, whereas scaling
of second kind (no dependence on the nuclear species)
works extremely well in the same region.

The Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model is able to
reproduce with good accuracy the superscaling proper-
ties of the data and gives a good microscopic descrip-
tion of quasi-elastic electron scattering data [28]. The
RMF model describes the bound state nucleons as single-
particle wave functions obtained by solving the Dirac
equation with self-consistent relativistic mean-ﬁeld po-
tentials [29–31]. The outgoing nucleon is described as
a continuum wave function, speciﬁcally, the solution of
the Dirac equation with the same strong mean-ﬁeld po-
tentials used to describe the bound state. This implies
that ﬁnal-state interactions (FSI) are taken into account
within a fully relativistic framework and the model is free
from non-orthogonality eﬀects. As shown in [11, 28, 32],
RMF predictions compare remarkably well with inclusive
electron scattering data up to moderated q-values, i.e.,
up to values of the knock-out nucleon kinetic energy, TN ,
of the order of 150 MeV. For larger values, i.e., high
momentum transfer, the energy-independent scalar and
vector potentials become unrealistically strong, leading
to results that depart very signiﬁcantly from data [28].
On the contrary, the relativistic plane wave impulse ap-
proximation (RPWIA), where FSI are turned oﬀ, yields
better predictions. Notice that at these high nucleon mo-
menta (
500 MeV) the overlap between initial and ﬁnal
states is suﬃciently small to prevent spurious contribu-
tions in the cross section.

≥

The SuSAv2 model [28, 33] takes advantage of these
observations and, on the base of superscaling [25, 26],
builds an eﬀective model that incorporates both regimes,
RMF and RPWIA, making use of a “blending” function.
The model extended to the inelastic spectrum and includ-
ing the important contribution of two-particle-two-hole

 
 
 
 
 
 
(2p2h) excitations induced by Meson Exchange Currents
(MEC) [34, 35], provides amazingly good agreement with
12C(e, e′) and 16O(e, e′) data for very diﬀerent kinemat-
ics and covering almost the whole range of energy trans-
fer [33]. Only at very low q and ω values does one ﬁnd
that SuSAv2 fails, and this should be expected since this
is the region where scaling breaks and collective nuclear
eﬀects are important. Likewise, the SuSAv2-MEC model
has also demonstrated a good level of compromise with
recent measurements of neutrino and antineutrino reac-
tions on carbon and oxygen [36–39].

In this work we present and discuss the SuSAv2-MEC
predictions with the new JLab data. We also perform an
analysis of the nuclear dynamics and the scaling phe-
nomenon for the diﬀerent nuclear targets involved by
means of the RMF and RPWIA approaches. Finally we
study the superscaling behavior of the JLab data both
in the quasi-elastic and in the 2p2h regimes to stress the
validity of the SuSAv2-MEC model.

In Fig. 1 we present the predictions of the SuSAv2-
MEC model compared with data for carbon (left panel),
titanium (middle) and argon (right). The values used
for the Fermi momentum, kF , are 0.228 GeV/c for car-
bon and 0.241 GeV/c for titanium and argon. As also
addressed in previous studies [27, 33], a shift in the trans-
ferred energy has also been included in all cases. More-
over, the extension of the SuSAv2 model to other nuclei,
both symmetric and asymmetric, beyond 12C is based as
well on RMF and RPWIA predictions [28] but consider-
ing the neutron and proton form factors weighted by the
corresponding neutron (N) and proton (Z) numbers. The
diﬀerences between neutrino reactions on symmetric and
asymmetric nuclear targets were carefully studied in [40]
within the Relativistic Fermi Gas (RFG) framework. Fol-
lowing this line, a dedicated analysis of the SuSAv2
predictions in asymmetric nuclei will be shortly pre-
sented [41]. For the QE regime, we describe the electro-
magnetic nucleon form factors using the extended Gari-
Krumpelmann (GKex) model [42]. The sensitivity of the
responses to other parametrizations has been discussed in
[43]. With regard to the inelastic structure functions, we
adopt the Bosted-Christy parametrization [44, 45] that
provides a good description of the resonant structures
in (e, e′) cross sections covering a wide kinematic region.
As shown in [46], the use of other choices such as the
Bodek-Ritchie [47] parametrization and models based on
Parton Distribution Functions (PDF) leads to very large
discrepancies with (e, e′) data.

In each graph the separate contributions correspond-
ing to the QE (red dashed line), the two-particle two-
hole MEC (blue short-dashed) and inelastic (green dot-
dashed) channels are shown. The total contribution is
represented by the solid line. The excellent agreement be-
tween theory and data is excellent over most of the energy
spectrum covering the QE, dip and a signiﬁcant region
in the inelastic domain. Only at the largest values of the
transferred energy (smallest values for the ejected elec-
tron energy) do the theoretical predictions depart from

2

data, these being larger.

The origin of this discrepancy is related to the speciﬁc
procedure used to determine the RMF/RPWIA transi-
tion in the SuSAv2 model in the inelastic regime. Details
on this analysis as well as a study on the sensitivity of the
(e, e′) cross sections to diﬀerent choices of the parameters
were given in [33]. In Fig. 1 we use the model as presented
in [33], even being aware that better agreement with the
high inelastic data could be achieved by employing other
options for the transition parameters. To illustrate this
point, we show in the bottom panels of Fig. 1 the pre-
dictions of a modiﬁed model where the inelastic region
is treated ignoring ﬁnal-state interactions, namely keep-
ing only the RPWIA component of the SuSAv2 model.
It appears that the ﬂat behavior of the cross section at
low E′ is better reproduced by the pure RPWIA inelas-
tic contribution, indicating that FSI are somewhat over-
estimated at very high energy in the present SuSAv2-
inelastic model. An updated version of the model, which
takes into account also these new JLab data in order to
improve description of the inelastic regime at very high
kinematics, will be presented in a forthcoming publica-
tion [48], the focus of the present work being more on the
QE and dip regions.

The level of accordance between data and theory in
the dip region where similar contributions emerge from
the three domains, viz. QE, 2p2h-MEC and inelastic, is
also outstanding. This can be considered to be a crucial
test for the validity of the model, and particularly, the
description of the 2p2h-MEC contribution that reaches
its maximum value in this region. Comparison between
theory and data shows excellent agreement for the three
nuclei, being even better in the case of the two heavier
asymmetric systems, 48Ti and 40Ar. This is reassuring as
this is the ﬁrst time the SuSAv2-MEC model is applied
to nuclei with isospin diﬀerent from zero. It is important
to point out that SuSAv2 is entirely based on results ob-
tained with the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model
and how well they fulﬁll scaling arguments. To make
contact with results in Fig. 1, in what follows we discuss
in detail RMF but applied for the ﬁrst time to asymmet-
ric nuclei. This is crucial to reinforce our conﬁdence in
the validity of the SuSAv2 approach extended to nonzero
isospin nuclei.

In Fig. 2 we restrict the comparison to the QE regime.
The solid line represents the RMF prediction, i.e., with
FSI incorporated through the scalar and vector poten-
tials in the ﬁnal state, whereas the dashed line refers to
the RPWIA result. As observed, the general behavior
of the curves for the two asymmetric nuclei, 48Ti and
40Ar, is similar to the case of 12C. In the three cases, the
RMF provides a cross section with a long tail extending
to smaller values of the scattered electron energy (larger
energy transferred). On the contrary, the RPWIA shows
a much more symmetrical shape but with the maximum
being higher and more in accordance with data (slightly
overestimating them). The values of the energy and mo-
mentum transfer in the QE peak are suﬃciently large

In what follows we investigate the validity of scaling ar-
guments within the RMF/RPWIA model, but including
in the analysis cross sections corresponding to non-zero
isospin nuclei, namely, titanium and argon. Note that
this is the basis of the SuSAv2 model. To make the dis-
cussions clearer, we start by presenting the basic expres-
sions needed to get the scaling function. For inclusive
QE electron scattering processes, the superscaling func-
tion is evaluated by dividing the diﬀerential cross section
by the appropriate single-nucleon eN elastic cross sec-
tion weighted by the corresponding proton and neutron
numbers [25–27, 49] involved in the process:

FIG. 3. (Color online) Superscaling function f (ψ) evaluated
with the RMF and RPWIA models for the following nuclear
systems: 12C, 40Ca, 40Ar, and 48Ti.

At suﬃciently high energies the function f extracted
from the data depends only on the scaling variable ψ but
not on the transferred momentum q. Moreover, f (ψ)
also becomes independent of the momentum scale in the
problem, that is, independent of kF . In the context of the
RMF and RWIA approaches, this is illustrated in Fig. 3
where we present f (ψ) for 12C, 40Ca, 48Ti and 40Ar. The
values of the Fermi momentum for carbon, titanium and
argon are the ones mentioned before, while kF for Ca
has been set to 241 MeV/c. Note the diﬀerent shape
in the scaling function when comparing RMF and RP-
WIA, the former with a long tail extended to high values
of ψ (large values of the transfer energy), whereas the
latter presents a much more symmetrical shape with the
maximum being signiﬁcantly higher. In both models, the
scaling function is very similar for all of the nuclei, par-
ticularly for the three heavier ones, Ca, Ti and Ar. Only
the case of carbon departs a little bit in the tail (RMF)
or in the maximum (RPWIA). This is partly connected
with the very diﬀerent bound nucleon shells involved in
the various calculations. In spite of that, scaling of the
second kind, i.e., independence on the nuclear system,
is fulﬁlled to high precision in all of the cases, making
it possible to deﬁne a general scaling function to be ap-
plicable also for asymmetric nuclei. This is the basis of
the SuSAv2 model that here is applied for the ﬁrst time
to nuclei with diﬀerent number of protons and neutrons
providing results in excellent agreement with data (see
Fig.1).

Next we perform an analysis of the superscaling be-
havior of the JLab data not only in the quasielastic re-
gion, but also in the “dip” region between the QE and
∆ peaks. We recall that this domain is particularly rele-
vant for the analyses of neutrino oscillation experiments,
where, due to the broadly distributed neutrino ﬂux, the

4

2p2h response is part of the so-called “QE-like” or “QE-
0π” cross section and cannot be disentangled from the
genuine QE response.

In the top left panel of Fig. 4 we present the superscal-
ing function, as given in Eq. (1), but extracted directly
from the experimental data. We show the whole energy
spectrum for the three nuclei, C, Ti and Ar. As observed,
scaling of second kind only works in the QE peak, then it
breaks down because non-impulsive contributions (2p2h)
and inelastic channels come into play. This was expected
from superscaling [25–27] and was also noticed in [18, 19].
In the region dominated by 2p2h and inelastic contribu-
tion, the results for 12C are signiﬁcantly below the ones
for 48Ti and 40Ar which are more in accordance. In or-
der to set how precise scaling of second kind occurs in the
QE peak, in the top right panel of Fig. 4 we zoom in to
the region at the left of the QE peak (up to ψ′
0.25).
Results prove without ambiguity that scaling of second
kind is excellent, that is, the superscaling function in this
region is universal, being valid up to high precision, for
all nuclei. Notice that all data overlap, being aligned
in an extremely narrow region. This is consistent with
previous analyses.

The behavior of data with scaling is further investi-
gated in the results shown in bottom panels of Fig. 4.
Here we present the superscaling function f (ψ′) but di-
vided by η3
kF /mN . The panel on the
left presents the results for the whole energy spectrum,
while the panel on the right is restricted to the dip re-
gion, namely, the region where the 2p2h-MEC contribu-
tions are more important. As shown, scaling is highly
broken in the QE peak (results for carbon are signif-
icantly higher), however, results collapse into a single
curve within the dip region. This is clearly observed in
the right panel where it is shown that all data overlap
within their error bars. This result conﬁrms our previ-
ous study in [51], where we predicted that 2p2h response
scales as k3
F . It is important to point out that the min-
imum in the cross section shown in Fig. 4 (bottom right
panel) corresponds to the maximum in the 2p2h con-
tribution (see Fig. 1). Although contributions from the
QE and inelastic domains also enter in the dip region,
and this may at some level break the scaling behavior,
results in bottom panels of Fig. 4 strongly reinforce our
conﬁdence in the validity of our 2p2h-MEC model, whose
predictions are very successfully conﬁrmed by the exper-
imental data. It is also interesting to note that the same
type of scaling, i.e, f (ψ′)/η3
F , seems to work reasonbly
well not only in the dip region but also in the resonance
and DIS domains. Further studies on the origin of this
behavior are underway.

To conclude, it is noteworthy that SuSAv2-MEC model
has proved its capability to describe successfully not only
electron but also charged-current neutrino scattering oﬀ
isospin symmetrical, N = Z, nuclei. In the case of elec-
tron scattering, the model has been extended to the high
inelastic domain providing a good description of data
over the whole energy spectrum. In this work, the model

is applied for the ﬁrst time to non-zero isospin nuclei
comparing its predictions with the recent data taken at
JLab for inclusive electron scattering on carbon, tita-
nium and argon. SuSAv2 makes use of a set of super-
scaling functions extracted from the predictions provided
by the RMF/RPWIA approach. Thus, we have evalu-
ated the RMF/RPWIA scaling functions corresponding
to the asymmetric Ti and Ar nuclei, and have compared
with the results for N = Z systems, as carbon and cal-
cium. The analysis performed shows unambiguously that
scaling of second kind works to high precision which re-
inforces the validity of one of the main SuSAv2 assump-
tions. Not only are the scaling arguments strengthened,
but also the model provides an excellent description of
the recent JLab data over the whole energy spectrum.
Some small discrepancy at very high energy transfer will
be corrected in the next version of the model, which is
currently under construction. The good agreement with
these data gives us conﬁdence in applying SuSAv2-MEC
to neutrino scattering on asymmetric nuclei.

The scaling behavior of the QE and 2p2h responses has
been investigated at depth by showing the superscaling
function extracted directly from the JLab data. As in
previous studies for symmetric nuclei, scaling of second
kind works extremely well in the region at the left of
the QE peak. On the contrary, the analysis of the dip
region, where 2p2h get their largest contributions, proves
that data obey a diﬀerent scaling law, such that the ratio
between the 2p2h and the QE responses scales as k3
F .
This result, predicted in [51], conﬁrms and strengthens
the validity of the 2p2h MEC model.

Finally, we emphasize the importance of scaling argu-

ments applied also to non-zero isospin nuclei, and the
successful description within the SuSAv2-MEC frame-
work of the inclusive electron scattering data on C,
Ti and Ar recently measured at JLab. This together
with the capability of the SuSAv2-MEC approach to
describe electron and neutrino interactions on diﬀer-
ent nuclei, translating sophisticated and demanding mi-
croscopic calculations into a straightforward formalism,
makes this model a promising candidate to be employed
in MonteCarlo event generators (NEUT [52], GENIE [53]
and NuWro [54]) used in neutrino oscillation analyses.
Accordingly, collaborations with experimental groups
at FermiLab (MINERνA, MicroBooNE) and J-PARC
(T2K) are being carried out to implement the SuSAv2-
MEC model for electron and neutrino reactions in event
generators with rewarding preliminary results [55].
