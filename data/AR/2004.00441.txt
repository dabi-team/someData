ABSTRACT

Context. The vertical diﬀusive halo size of the Galaxy, L, is a key parameter for dark matter indirect searches. It can be better
determined thanks to recent AMS-02 data.
Aims. We set constraints on L from Be/B and 10Be/Be data, and we performed a consistency check with positron data. We detail the
dependence of Be/B and 10Be/Be on L and forecast on which energy range better data would be helpful for future L improvements.
Methods. We used usine v3.5 for the propagation of nuclei, and e+ were calculated with the pinching method.
Results. The current AMS-02 Be/B (∼ 3% precision) and ACE-CRIS 10Be/Be (∼ 10% precision) data bring similar and consistent
constraints on L. The AMS-02 Be/B data alone constrain L = 5+3
−2 kpc at a 68% conﬁdence level (spanning diﬀerent benchmark
transport conﬁgurations), a range for which most models do not overproduce positrons. Future experiments need to deliver percent-
level accuracy on 10Be/9Be anywhere below 10 GV to further constrain L.
Conclusions. Forthcoming AMS-02, HELIX, and PAMELA 10Be/9Be results will further test and possibly tighten the limits derived
here. Elemental ratios involving radioactive species with diﬀerent lifetimes (e.g. Al/Mg and Cl/Ar) are also awaited to provide
complementary and robuster constraints.

1. Introduction

Finding the Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) sources, solving the de-
tails of CR transport in the Galaxy, and using the CR as a channel
to identify the nature of dark matter (DM) are among the main
challenges in CR physics. In the last decade, anti-matter data re-
ceived a lot of scrutiny, owing to the interpretation of the positron
fraction rise as a DM signal (Adriani et al. 2009, Bergström et al.
2008, and Feng & Zhang 2018), although standard astrophysics
explanations are more likely (e.g. Hooper et al. 2009, Delahaye
et al. 2010, Serpico 2012, and Manconi et al. 2019). Similarly,
the presence of a DM contribution in the p data is debated in the
literature (Reinert & Winkler 2018, Cholis et al. 2019, Cuoco
et al. 2019, and Boudaud et al. 2020). The latter channel is ac-
tually one of the best at constraining weakly interacting massive
particles DM candidates in the GeV-TeV mass range (e.g. Con-
rad & Reimer 2017).

DM interpretations for antimatter CRs depend on both the
transport and geometry parameters (Donato et al. 2004, Dela-
haye et al. 2008, and Aramaki et al. 2016); the latter is mostly de-
termined via CR radioactive clocks. These clocks have a lifetime
of approximately a million years, one order of magnitude shorter
than the typical CR propagation time in the Galaxy. Ratios of
a secondary (i.e. produced at the propagation stage only) un-

stable species to their stable counterpart, for instance 10Be/9Be,
allow one to break the degeneracy between the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient normalisation and the halo size of the Galaxy (e.g. Donato
et al. 2002). However, CR isotopic separation in experiments
is challenging. The ﬁrst measurements were carried out more
than forty years ago for 10Be (Webber et al. 1973), 36Cl (Young
et al. 1981), 26Al (Webber 1982), and 54Mn (Webber et al. 1979);
however, even recent measures (Connell 1998, Yanasak et al.
2001, and Hams et al. 2004) are restricted to low energy mostly,
that is, below a few hundreds of MeV/n. As an alternative and
complementary approach, Webber & Soutoul (1998) proposed to
use elemental ratios (e.g. Be/B, Al/Mg) in which the CR clock
appears both in the numerator (decayed fraction) and denomina-
tor (daughter fed by decaying CR). Elemental ratios have been
measured up to hundreds of GeV/n, hence covering an energy
range in which 10Be goes from mostly decayed to meta-stable,
with respect to the propagation time, at high energy. While
waiting for the AMS-02 future release of Be isotope data, the
high-precision Be/B ratio already gives useful constraints (Evoli
et al. 2020). However, the isotopic fraction of 10Be in B is a few
percent only, and the sensitivity of Be/B to L is partly drowned
by the dominant presence of the stable nucleus 7Be (Tomassetti
2015b).

The positron data have also been recently shown to provide
interesting constraints on L (Lavalle et al. 2014). In particular,
for small L, the unavoidable secondary production, mostly from
H and He CRs on the interstellar medium (ISM), may overshoot

low-energy data points. Therefore they can be used as a comple-
mentary probe to set a lower limit on L.

This study follows up on our previous eﬀort to determine
CR transport parameters (Génolini et al. 2019; Weinrich et al.
2020). We performed a joint analysis of Li/C, B/C, and vari-
ous combinations of 10Be data to determine L. We then drew
models from the allowed regions of their parameter space and
further checked their consistency with the positron constraint.
We stress that in this analysis, as is the case in almost all similar
studies, the halo size of the Galaxy is set to be a hard boundary
where the CR density goes to zero. This is an eﬀective mod-
elling of a more realistic picture that would probably involve a
rapidly growing diﬀusion coeﬃcient in the halo (Di Bernardo
et al. 2013; Tomassetti 2015a). In fact, a modelling of CR, gas,
and wave interactions from ﬁrst principles leads to the picture
of a dynamic halo (Breitschwerdt et al. 1991; Zirakashvili et al.
1996). Recent results from Evoli et al. (2018) show, in partic-
ular, that the turbulent cascade from CR sources and the self-
generation of waves by CRs can introduce an eﬀective halo size.
Full numerical simulations aimed at accurately computing CRs
in a magneto-hydrodynamic framework will probably give more
insight into this problem, as envisaged in Girichidis et al. (2020).
In the meantime, the concept of hard boundary remains a useful
benchmark for many CR-related studies.

The paper is organised as follows: In Sect. 2, we recall the
propagation model and conﬁgurations used for the analysis. In
Sect. 3, we assess the capability of 10Be/9Be, Be/B, or B/C cur-
rent data to determine L, accounting for various modelling un-
certainties; we then provide the resulting constraints on L. In
Sect. 4, we discuss other possible observables to determine L,
and we look at the ﬂux of secondary positrons, given the Be/B
constraint on L. In Sect. 5, we summarise and conclude. Fur-
ther details of the analysis and additional cross-checks are re-
ported to the appendices: App. A provides scaling relations of
the transport parameters with L for stable secondary species—
they extend, for all transport parameters, those that were given
in App. C of Génolini et al. (2019); App. B highlights the con-
straints on L set by various 10Be/9Be datasets (low-energy exper-
iments, ISOMAX, and preliminary PAMELA analysis); App. C
outlines why 7Be/(9Be+10Be), the most favourable isotopic ratio
to extract experimentally, is of no practical use to constrain L.

2. Model and conﬁgurations (BIG, SLIM, QUAINT)

The details of the transport equation and approach we follow are
detailed in Génolini et al. (2019) and in the companion paper
(Weinrich et al. 2020). Here, we only recall the most important
features of the model.

We assume the CR density to obey a steady-state diﬀusion-
advection equation. The geometry of the diﬀusion halo deﬁnes
the region in which CRs propagate and are conﬁned, here con-
sidered an inﬁnite slab of half-thickness L, the parameter we aim
at determining in this analysis.
In this geometry, CR sources
and the gas are pinched in an inﬁnitely thin plan (half-thickness
h = 100 pc(cid:28) L), where interactions with the gas (spallation,
energy gains and losses) are restricted to. A convection term
Vc is taken to be constant and perpendicular to the disc. We
assume isotropic and homogeneous diﬀusion, and account for
diﬀusion in momentum space: we follow the treatment of Seo
et al. (1994), that is Kpp(R, x) ∝ 2 h δ(z) (VA p)2/K(R) where VA
is the Alfvénic speed of the plasma wave. These assumptions al-
low one to derive solutions semi-analytically (Jones et al. 2001;
Maurin et al. 2001). Our calculations are performed with the

tions analysed in this study, see Eq. (1). We schematically separate
the parameters in several rigidity domains, but VA and Vc impact ﬂuxes

reader to Génolini et al. (2019) and Weinrich et al. (2020).

Several theoretical studies have hinted at the possible pres-
ence of breaks at low- (Ptuskin et al. 2006) or high-rigidity (Blasi
et al. 2012; Evoli et al. 2018). Actually, spectral breaks are seen
in CR data at low- (Stone et al. 2013) and high-rigidity (Aguilar
et al. 2018a), and they can be connected to the presence of breaks
in the diﬀusion coeﬃcient at rigidities Rl ≈ 4 − 5 GV (Géno-
lini et al. 2019; Vittino et al. 2019; Weinrich et al. 2020) and
Rh ≈ 250 GV (Génolini et al. 2017, Reinert & Winkler 2018,
Génolini et al. 2019, and Evoli et al. 2019). For these reasons

In this study, we ﬁx several parameters whose impact on the
results is negligible:
the three high-rigidity break parameters
(Rh, δh, sh) are set to the values reported in Génolini et al. (2019);
the smoothness of the low-rigidity break parameter is ﬁxed at sl
= 0.04 (fast transition).

We use three benchmark conﬁgurations BIG, SLIM, and
QUAINT deﬁned in Génolini et al. (2019), whose relevant pa-
rameters are collected in Table 1. In this analysis, BIG has 7 free
parameters (K0, δ, Rl, δl, Vc, VA, L). The conﬁguration SLIM is
a special case of BIG, with VA = Vc = 0 and η = 1, and it has 5 free
parameters (K0, δ, Rl, δl, L). The conﬁguration QUAINT is also
a special case of BIG with no low-rigidity break, and it has 6 free
parameters (K0, δ, η, Vc, VA, L). QUAINT is also an extension
(because of the high-rigidity break) of older benchmark convec-
tion and reacceleration models used for instance in Maurin et al.
(2010) and Di Bernardo et al. (2010).

We ﬁtted the model to the data via a χ2 minimisation,

where t and qt run over the several ﬂux ratios (e.g. Li/C, Be/C,
B/C) measured at diﬀerent periods, whereas r runs over cross-
section reactions. The non-diagonal Dt,qt
cov term allows for i j
energy bins correlations in the data (covariance matrix). The
N t,q
Sol.Mod. and NXS terms account for Solar modulation and cross-
section nuisance parameters, respectively. More details on this
procedure are given in App. B of Derome et al. (2019). For fur-
ther details related to the Li/C, Be/C, and B/C data uncertainties
(correlation matrix of systematics), and also solar modulation
and cross-section priors, we refer the reader to our companion
paper (Weinrich et al. 2020).

The minimisation is performed with the minuit package
(James & Roos 1975), its minos algorithm also providing ac-
curate (asymmetric) error bars even if the problem is very non-
linear. In practice, the minuit routines are directly called from
usine (Maurin 2020). We also carry out O(100) minimisations
from diﬀerent starting points to ensure the true minimum is
found (Weinrich et al. 2020). All uncertainties reported on the
halo size in this study are derived from the proﬁle likelihood
method (with minos) at the 68% conﬁdence level. As the χ2 def-
inition accounts for energy correlations in the data uncertainties
and nuisance parameters, the halo size uncertainties also account
for them. We stress that uncertainties were derived on log(L)
and are mostly symmetric on this parameter. For this reason, we
loosely use the notation 1σ in the following, and for instance,
2σ limits can be estimated assuming a log-normal distribution
for L.

3. Halo size L from CR clocks

Radioactive secondary species whose lifetime is shorter than es-
cape time decay before experiencing the boundary of the Galaxy.
These species are only sensitive to the diﬀusion coeﬃcient K,
whereas stable secondary species can escape and are sensitive to
K/L. Any ﬁt combining the information of a stable and radioac-
tive secondary species breaks the K/L degeneracy, allowing for
the determination of L (Donato et al. 2002).

Below, we focus on 10Be (t1/2 = 1.387 Myr) and related ra-
tios (10Be/9Be, 10Be/Be, and Be/B). To date, 10Be is the only
available CR chronometer for which high-precision data exist
for the associated elemental ﬂux, Be. The Al, Cl, and Mn ﬂuxes
have not been released by the AMS-02 collaboration, yet.

3.1. CR datasets and modulation levels

This analysis is based on several datasets. Each dataset is associ-
ated to a solar modulation level depending on its data taking pe-
riod. We use here the simple force-ﬁeld approximation (Gleeson
& Axford 1967, 1968, and Caballero-Lopez & Moraal 2004),
whose single parameter, φFF, is taken as a nuisance parameter
in the analyses. As detailed in Weinrich et al. (2020), the solar
modulation level (prior) for each dataset is based on the analysis
of neutron monitor data (Maurin et al. 2015; Ghelﬁ et al. 2016,
2017a,b).

As in Weinrich et al. (2020), the baseline data used to ﬁx the
transport parameters are AMS-02 Li/C and B/C data (Aguilar
et al. 2018a)—denoted ‘base’ in the following. The halo size L is
then constrained by combining the base with several ratios from
diﬀerent datasets. The largest dataset is that of AMS-02 Be/B,
covering ∼ 3 GV to ∼ 2 TV. We also have several low-energy
10Be/9Be or 10Be/Be datasets available, retrieved from CRDB2
(Maurin et al. 2014). Except for the ISOMAX data reaching

∼ 2 GeV/n, most of them (ACE, IMP7&8, ISEE3, Ulysses, and
Voyager1&2) are at a few hundreds of MeV/n.

The various datasets of interest are listed in Table 2, along
with their estimated Solar modulation level and bibliographic
reference. Several ratio and dataset combinations are consid-
ered, in order to assess and compare their respective impact on L.
Combined to ‘base’ (i.e. Li/C and B/C data only), which enables
the determination of the transport parameters, at least one 10Be-
related dataset is necessary to determine L. In particular, for ﬁts
involving 10Be/9Be, we diﬀerentiate three groups (see Table 2):
the most precise low-energy data only (‘ACE’), low-energy data
without ACE (‘LE w/o ACE’), or intermediate energy data only
(‘ISOMAX’). For consistency for the Solar modulation nuisance
parameters, in all ﬁts involving low-energy isotopic ratios, we
consider, if available, the associated similarly modulated Li/C
and B/C low-energy data (in addition to AMS-02 data).

3.2. Expected constraints from B/C, Be/B, and 10Be/Be

Before moving to the ﬁts and results, we wish to understand how
strongly L can be constrained by diﬀerent data combinations of
10Be. Ratios directly involving 10Be should be optimal, but ow-

lead to some constraint, via the fraction of 10B generated by
10Be decay. The most favourable option would include some
information on the 10Be content, high-precision data, and signif-
icant dynamic range. For instance, at ∼ 1 GeV/n, the B/C and
Be/C fraction from unstable isotopes are respectively ∼ 5% and
5 − 10%, with data available from GV to TV at 3 − 5% precision
(Aguilar et al. 2018a); for 10Be, the fraction is 100% with data in
the ∼ 50 − 200 MeV/n range at ∼ 10 − 15% precision (Yanasak
et al. 2001).

We ﬁrst pick a reference conﬁguration and L to which other
calculations are compared. This conﬁguration is taken from our
companion paper, Weinrich et al. (2020), and is based on the
simultaneous analysis of AMS-02 Li/C, Be/C and B/C data at
ﬁxed L = 5 kpc. To see how sensitive to L calculated ratios
are, we vary L ensuring that the level of production remains un-
changed for secondary stable species—this constraint is satisﬁed
with an appropriate rescaling of the transport parameters (see
App. A)3. From this set-up, we calculate the relative variation of
B/C, Be/B, 10Be/Be, and 10Be/9Be with respect to the reference
values at L = 5 kpc.

The results are shown in Fig. 1, with the dependence upon
growing L illustrated via the growing thickness of dotted lines,
while diﬀerent uniformly coloured bands represent diﬀerent the-
oretical uncertainties (described and discussed in Sec. 3.3). For
B/C (top panel), even for unrealistic variations of L, the max-
imal impact is a few percent only. On the other hand, vary-
ing L from 2.5 to 12 kpc leads to variations of up to 5% for
Be/B (second panel) and up to 35% for 10Be/9Be and 10Be/Be
(two bottom panels). Secondly, whereas these variations peak
strongly around ∼ 30 GV for Be/B, they are constant for all en-
ergy below a few GeV/n for 10Be/9Be and 10Be/Be. We over-
lay on the plots (hatched regions) the existing data coverage in
terms of energy range and total uncertainties. From the compari-
son with the L-dependent curves (thin- to thick-dotted lines), we
conclude that B/C data alone can only provide very loose upper
limits ((cid:46) 20 − 30 kpc), while Be/B, 10Be/9Be, and 10Be/Be are
all expected to constrain L to better than a factor 2.

3.3. Directions for future experimental efforts

By pursuing further the reasoning, we can also forecast where
future measurements could improve the constraint on L. From
Fig. 1, energy ranges where L is the most impacting are be-
tween 10 and 100 GV for Be/B data, and below a few GeV/n for
10Be/9Be. However, to fairly assess the sensitivity of each ra-
tio, model uncertainties should be taken into account—broadly
speaking, model uncertainties originate from transport, cross-
section, and solar modulation.

Technically we proceed as follows: starting from the best ﬁt
and covariance matrix of the relevant parameters (standard out-
puts of ﬁts with usine v3.5), we draw realisations of the param-
eters of interest, from which new values for the ratios are cal-
culated; we then extract contours and conﬁdence levels on these
ratios. Repeating the drawing procedure considering the full co-
variance matrix of parameters or only block elements of this ma-

energy per nucleon (lower panels). All the panels compare three dif-
ferent eﬀects: (i) the thin- to thick-dashed lines correspond, at constant
grammage, to the impact of L on the calculated ratios (the reference is

3 There is a subtlety for B/C, as it contains 10B having decayed from
10Be. Depending how scaling relations are derived, they absorb or not
the L dependence of this decayed fraction. We use the theory-based
scaling relations to study the sensitivity of B/C to L, but the ﬁt-driven
ones for the remaining ratios (see App. A).

trix, we can propagate the model uncertainties all together (e.g.
B/C in the top panel of Fig. 1) or separately (all remaining pan-
els). This naturally accounts for the full or partial correlations
between the parameters.

Weinrich et al.: Galactic halo size in the light of recent AMS-02 data

We show in the panels of Fig. 1 various model uncertain-
ties (1σ contours) obtained from sampling 104 realisations of
the model parameters for SLIM4. Overall, solar modulation un-
certainties ((cid:46) 5%, purple contours) are sub-dominant in the
model error budget; they are also sub-dominant with respect to
data uncertainties (hatched boxes). For isotopic ratios, cross-
section uncertainties dominate (∼ 10 − 20%, green contours),
followed by transport uncertainties ((cid:46) 10%, orange contours).
Let us detail separately the conclusions that can be drawn for
B/C, Be/B, 10Be/Be, and 10Be/9Be—for completeness, we also
show in App. C the 7Be/(9Be+10 Be) ratio, more easily measured
but unfortunately not constraining for L.

Firstly, the status of the B/C ratio (top panel) is diﬀerent from
the other ones, because transport is calibrated on it. For this rea-
son, the associated uncertainties are typically at the level of the
data uncertainties. Given the poor sensitivity of B/C to L, at least
a factor of ten improvement on data errors would be necessary
to bring any improvement on L.

Secondly, for the Be/B ratio (second panel), the optimal re-
gion to constrain L is from a few GV to a few tens of GV, ex-
actly in the region where AMS-02 data have the smallest errors
(∼ 3%). In this region, cross-section uncertainties (green con-
tours) are at the 5% level, meaning that better nuclear cross-
section data could already slightly shrink the allowed L values
by ∼ 30%. Better Be/B data could strengthen the L constraint,
but only with cross-sections uncertainties brought to par. How-
ever, improving CR data systematics below the percent level is
very challenging.

Thirdly, for the isotopic 10Be/Be and 10Be/9Be ratios (bot-
tom two panels), we have to slightly change our estimation of
cross-section uncertainties. Contrarily to elemental ratios, in
which only the overall element production matters (sum of 7Be,
9Be, and 10Be), isotopic ratios directly depend on the associated
isotopic production cross sections. To be conservative—though
probably too pessimistic—, we draw each isotopic production
cross sections (independently) within their expected uncertainty
range5. As for Be/B, the cross-section uncertainties are the dom-
inant modelling uncertainties. At variance with Be/B, any region
below 10 GeV/n is equally suited to constrain L. In the high-
energy end of this interval, current data uncertainties are larger
than the model uncertainties, so that there is a small window for
improvements on data to improve the constraints on L. Also, CR
data on a large energy range should provide a better lever arm to
handle cross-section uncertainties.

We can now conclude on the best way to improve the con-
straints on L in the future. On the short term, forthcoming
10Be/9Be AMS-02 and PAMELA data up to 10 GeV/n are the
best candidates to improve the constraints on L. On a longer
term, the easiest way to improving isotopic CR data would be to
focus on GeV/n energies for this same ratio. Improving the pre-
cision of Be/B data would be only signiﬁcant at the sub-percent
level, but this is likely to remain diﬃcult to achieve, even for fu-
ture CR projects like HERD (Cattaneo & HERD Collaboration
2019), ALADInO (Adriani et al. 2019), or AMS-100 (Schael
et al. 2019). In any case, be it for Be/B or isotopic ratios, the

4 Conﬁgurations having more free parameters (QUAINT and BIG)
would provide larger uncertainties; see Fig. 4 in Weinrich et al. (2020).
5 We follow the NSS prescription (Derome et al. 2019; Weinrich et al.
2020), where we vary the cross-section normalisation and low-energy
behaviour (power-law slope) of the dominant production channel for
each Be isotope. We use a dispersion σSlope = 0.15 for these reactions,
and σNorm = 0.25, 0.20, and 0.15 for 12C+H→10Be, 12C+H→9Be, and
16O+H →7Be respectively.

straint set from AMS-02 data only (Li/C, Be/B, and B/C). The remain-
ing columns combine ‘Base’ data (from ﬁrst column) to 10Be/Be low-
energy data (third column), to 10Be/9Be low- and intermediate-energy
(next-to-last column), or combine all the previous cases (last column).

common limiting factor to all improvements are cross-section
uncertainties.

3.4. Actual constraints on L

In this section, we present the constraints on L from various data
combinations. The ﬁtting procedure and free (and nuisance) pa-
rameters are as discussed in Sect. 2—see also our companion
paper for more details (Weinrich et al. 2020).

3.4.1. Results

Figure 2 shows the constraints (at 1σ) brought by the ratios
discussed in the previous section (B/C, Be/B, 10Be/Be, and
10Be/9Be) for the three conﬁgurations BIG (blue circle), SLIM
(orange crosses), or QUAINT (green triangles). We ﬁrst stress
that the various transport conﬁgurations all give similar con-
straints on L—we do not show results for the transport param-
eters as they are available and were abundantly discussed in
Weinrich et al. (2020). The behaviour for the diﬀerent ratios
(columns) is in qualitative agreement with the expectations dis-

gives an upper limit L (cid:46) 15 kpc, whereas in the second and third
columns, Be/B AMS-02 and 10Be/Be low-energy data give sim-
ilar constraints L ≈ 5 ± 3 kpc. The fourth column is based on
the results from the same experiments as in the third column, but
ﬁtting 10Be/Be instead of 10Be/9Be data, and with the additional
use of intermediate-energy ISOMAX data (see Table 2). This
gives a slightly lower best-ﬁt value and uncertainties compared
to 10Be/Be data, but this apparent improvement is related to a
tension between ISOMAX data and all the others. The reduced
uncertainties result from an attempt to accommodate all the data

3.4.2. Discussion

It is interesting to compare our results to those of previous anal-
yses that considered either ACE-CRIS 10Be/9Be ratio or Be/B
data. Based on the analysis of 10Be/9Be and other radioactive
isotopes, and using a diﬀusion model with δ ≈ 0.3, the GAL-
PROP team found L ∈ [1.5 − 6] kpc (Moskalenko et al. 2001),
and later on, using an evolved Bayesian analysis, found L =
5.4 ± 1.4 kpc (Trotta et al. 2011). Actually, the halo size strongly
correlates with the diﬀusion slope δ (Donato et al. 2002; Putze
et al. 2010). Using 1D or 2D semi-analytical models, our team
found L ≈ 5 kpc (Donato et al. 2002) for δ ∼ 0.5, and later on,
also in an evolved Bayesian context, found L ≈ 4±1 kpc in a pure
diﬀusion/reacceleration model (Putze et al. 2010). All these val-
ues are consistent with the constraints derived here using ACE-
CRIS 10Be/9Be data only (see Fig. 2), that is L ∈ [3 − 8] kpc.
Our uncertainties are larger than in previous studies, because we
include here production cross-section uncertainties.

Comparatively, less studies focused on elemental ratios. Us-
ing HEAO-3 Be/B data (and other ratios) in a semi-analytical
diﬀusion model with δ = 0.6, a rough range of L ∈ [2 − 4] kpc
was found in Webber & Soutoul (1998). A much larger range
was found in Putze et al. (2010), with L a few kpc only al-

1998, Moskalenko et al. 2001, Donato et al. 2002, and Putze
et al. 2010): similar halo sizes were observed, though with a
large scatter. Forthcoming AMS-02 data on other elemental ra-
tios (e.g. Al/Mg, Cl/Ar. . . ) will allow one to repeat these anal-
yses. Another eﬀect could impact these conclusions. In Donato
et al. (2002) and Putze et al. (2010), the impact of a local sub-
density, exponentially attenuating the ﬂux of radioactive species,
was inspected: slightly larger or much larger uncertainties were
observed depending on the transport conﬁguration used (Putze
et al. 2010). However, this was calculated assuming a similar
diﬀusion in the local bubble and in the rest of the disc and halo,
which may be questionable. Recent γ-ray observations (Abey-
sekara et al. 2017; Di Mauro et al. 2019)—interpreted as pockets
of slow diﬀusion around pulsars (e.g. Profumo et al. 2018)—,
and the indication that the local ISM properties are aﬀected by
several SN explosions a few Myr ago (Fields et al. 2019) provide
enough motivation to revisit this issue in a future study.

4. Constraints on L from other probes

In this section, we discuss several independent constraints on
L. We ﬁrst review a series of constraints derived from multi-
wavelength observations of the Milky Way and other spiral
galaxies, and then determine explicitly direct constraints induced
by low-energy secondary CR positrons.

4.1. Direct and indirect constraints from radio and gamma’s

Radio emission in the MHz to GHz band from our Galaxy has
been used to constrain the magnetised halo thickness L (Bring-
mann et al. 2012, Orlando & Strong 2013, Di Bernardo et al.
2013, and Biswas & Gupta 2018). This band is dominated by
the synchroton emission of the leptonic component of CR in the
Galactic magnetic ﬁeld. The Galactic latitude proﬁle of the ra-
dio maps are sensitive to the vertical gradient of CR sourcing
the emission, ∝ 1/L. Although relying on some assumptions
(mostly on the magnetic ﬁeld) these arguments tend to agree in
excluding low values of L, typically obtaining L (cid:38) 2 kpc, with
variations within a factor 2 depending on the analysis. They are
somewhat less sensitive to large values of L, although upper lim-
its in the range L (cid:46) 10 − 15 kpc have been derived. Further
arguments based on radio observations such as rotation measure-
ments of pulsars also yield results broadly consistent with these
constraints (Di Bernardo et al. 2013).

A complementary indirect indication can be derived by look-
ing at the radio emissions of other spiral galaxies seen almost
edge-on, which present an average scale-height of their syn-
chrotron emission of about 1.8 ± 0.2 kpc (Krause 2014). This
translates, under the hypothesis of energy equipartition between
magnetic ﬁeld and cosmic ray energy density, in the typical con-
straint on the magnetised halo size L (cid:38) 6.2−7.8 kpc (Beck 2015).
A recent analysis of an in-depth view of a spiral galaxy very sim-
ilar to the Milky Way, NGC 891, reaches similar conclusions as
for the vertical extension of the magnetic halo (Schmidt et al.
2019).

In principle, independent constraints can be derived from dif-
fuse Galactic γ-ray data (Stecker & Jones 1977). The advantage
is that the bulk of the data in the Fermi-LAT energy range (GeV)
comes from π0 decays of hadronic origin. Hence, the γ-ray ﬂux
mostly probes the convolution of the hadronic CR ﬂux with the
gas density. For instance, let us consider a simple model where
CR transport is purely diﬀusive within a slab (1D-model). As-
suming the gas is exponentially distributed with typical thickness

data excepted).

lowed for δ (cid:46) 0.3, growing to larger than 10 kpc for δ ≈ 0.5.
This tension with 10Be/9Be data was attributed to cross-section
uncertainties—their importance in limiting the prediction power
of Be/B is detailed in Tomassetti (2015b). Using updated cross
sections and propagating their uncertainties, we ﬁnd here L =
5+3
−2 kpc based on AMS-02 Be/B data, which is now compatible
with values derived from ACE-CRIS 10Be/9Be data. Similar val-
ues were found by the GALPROP team, using both ACE-CRIS
and AMS-02 Be ﬂuxes (without 10Be/9Be), with L = 4 ± 0.6
(Boschini et al. 2020). This stronger constraint is somehow in
line with the fact that combining ACE-CRIS and AMS-02 data
lead to tighter constraints (see Table 3), but as these authors do
not use 10Be/9Be, it is most probably attributed to a larger ex-
tent to the fact that they do not propagate cross-section uncer-
tainties. In any case, the value of L with a small error inferred
in Boschini et al. (2020) is also in mild tension with the re-
cent analysis of AMS-02 Be data in Evoli et al. (2020), where
a best-ﬁt value of L = 7 kpc but a lower limit L (cid:38) 5 kpc is
found in a semi-analytical model similar to the one used here.
Their central value, using total or statistical uncertainties only,
is always enclosed within our 1σ conﬁdence interval: ﬁrstly, the
diﬀerence with our best-ﬁt value is possibly due to their cross-
section parametrisation (Evoli et al. 2019), as illustrated in Fig. 2
of Evoli et al. (2020); secondly, our broader conﬁdence interval
is certainly related to our treatment (full propagation) of cross-
section uncertainties.

In conclusion, most past and present analyses of 10Be/9Be
and Be/B show a preference for L ≈ 4 − 5 kpc, with a currently
estimated 1σ uncertainty of about 50%. Several analyses have
combined or compared these results to the constraints brought by
other ratios of radioactive secondary species (Webber & Soutoul

Since we expect h/L ∼ 1% − 10%, the factors entering the actual
γ-ray ﬂux normalisation should be known to an unrealistically
high precision for this method to provide meaningful constraints
on L. However, additional inverse Compton contributions from
leptonic CR component are also sensitive to L, and cannot be
neglected. A global analysis of the diﬀuse γ-ray emission mea-
sured by the Fermi-LAT satellite actually shows a systematic
improvement of the statistical likelihood as L increases up to
∼ 10 kpc (Ackermann et al. 2012), an eﬀect particularly impor-
tant when ﬁtting the emission at large longitudes. Conversely,
the study of high- and intermediate-velocity clouds at few kpcs
away from the Galactic plane leads to the constraint L < 6 kpc
(Tibaldo et al. 2015). Although this bound can be subject to
variations (e.g. from the presence of unaccounted ionised gas in
these clouds), the diﬀerent trends between this constraint and the
one obtained from radio observations of distant galaxies might
be explained by the radio emission of leptons leaking out beyond
the conﬁnement volume. Also, the too shallow γ-ray gradient
suggested by Fermi-LAT data admits alternative explanations,
for instance in terms of a physically motivated correlation of
the diﬀusion properties with galactocentric distance (Evoli et al.
2012).

4.2. Constraints from e+

Secondary positrons, usually believed to dominate the local CR
positron ﬂux at low energy, can also be used to derive lower lim-
its on the halo size (Lavalle et al. 2014, Boudaud et al. 2017, and
Reinert & Winkler 2018). Their predicted abundance depends
much less on the conﬁguration of the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld
than the radio limits, and their theoretical uncertainties are bet-
ter under control (see below). Secondary positrons may there-
fore signiﬁcantly constrain propagation models, while still on
the conservative side since their local ﬂux is known to be dom-
inated by primaries above a few GeV (e.g. Aharonian et al.
1995, Adriani et al. 2009, Hooper et al. 2009, and Delahaye et al.
2010).

4.2.1. Positron ﬂux scaling with K0 and L and calculation

The steady-state local positron density is expected to scale like
the production rate times the minimal propagation timescale in-
volved. An additional dilution factor comes from the fact that
the production volume Vp is, in most cases, smaller than the
diﬀusion volume Vλ (Bulanov et al. 1976). Sticking to a one-
dimensional picture, we have Vp/Vλ ≈ h/λ(E). In the latter ex-
pression, h is the half-height of the thin disc (where the ISM gas
is conﬁned), and λ(E) =
2 K0 ˜τ(E) is the positron propagation
length scale, featuring the pseudo-energy loss timescale ˜τ.

√

The interesting regime to constrain L is, similarly to radioac-
tive species, when h < λ < L, that is, when the vertical boundary
does not aﬀect the positron density and ˜τ does not depend appre-
ciably on K0. This typically happens at energies (cid:46) 10 GeV, for

Article number, page 8 of 15

√

√

K0, and the e+ ﬂux then scales as 1/
which λ ∝
K0. There-
fore, since energy loss parameters are ﬁxed independently from
the propagation model, the positron ﬂux is a direct probe of the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient normalisation K0. Since the B/C ratio pro-
vides constraints on the ratio K0/L, positron measurements en-
able an indirect probe of L: The lower L in a B/C-compatible
model, the larger the secondary positron ﬂux.

In practice, we calculate the positron ﬂux according to the
pinching method introduced in Boudaud et al. (2017)—see also
Delahaye et al. (2009) for earlier attempts. For production, we
consider incident and target species up to He only, and we take
the cross-section parametrisation of Kamae et al. (2006), which
accounts for the low-energy hadronic resonances.
Positron
ﬂuxes are then compared to AMS-02 data (Aguilar et al. 2019a)
assuming φFF = 650 MV, as estimated for the corresponding
data-taking period May 2011-November 2017 (see below for
a discussion on Solar modulation level and its uncertainties).
There are various sources of uncertainties in the calculation, and
we try to list and quantify them below.

4.2.2. Error budget

We consider the uncertainties on the interstellar (IS) ﬂux, and
then comment on how the conclusions change for Top-of-
Atmosphere (TOA) ﬂuxes. We mostly focus on results at 1 GeV,
because this is the typical energy where our analysis can draw
constraints (see next subsection).

Firstly, we consider model uncertainties. Indeed, the method
of calculation itself has some limitations. In the low- and high-
energy regimes, propagation is dominated by energy losses in the
disc and in the halo respectively. The pinching method allows to
calculate intermediate energies by pinching the halo losses in
the disc (Boudaud et al. 2017), ensuring that both the limiting
cases are recovered. Further comparisons against full numerical
solutions should be carried out to deﬁnitively assess the accu-
racy of the method in the transition zone. Nevertheless, we have
checked that the method is robust in the energy range used to
deﬁne our limits below.

In a broader context, one could question the reliability of 1D
models for consistency checks between nuclei and leptons, in
the context of spatially-dependent distributions of sources and
gas. Given the timescales of various transport parameters and
energy losses, both these species originate from a few kpc away
at GeV energies (Taillet & Maurin 2003, Maurin & Taillet 2003,
and Jóhannesson et al. 2016).
It means that their production
and losses are sensitive to kpc-averages over the gas density
properties—of course, this is no longer the case for very high
energy leptons. So as long as we focus on the multi-GeV energy
range, we do not expect strong diﬀerences due to gas inhomo-
geneities between nuclei and positrons, but as would be expected
from more reﬁned models, 1D model calculations are sensitive
to the absolute value of the averaged gas density. This is at vari-
ance with the case of secondary radioactive species, discussed
in Sec. 3.4, which could be very sensitive to the local ISM.
However, similarly to radioactive nuclei, inhomogeneous spa-
tial diﬀusion zones around CR sources (Abeysekara et al. 2017;
Di Mauro et al. 2019), could also aﬀect primary and secondary
lepton spectra in diﬀerent and very non trivial ways. These com-
plications go beyond the scope of this analysis.

Secondly, we consider uncertainties from the choice of CR
projectiles, targets, and cross sections. Any uncertainty on the
CR ﬂuxes and production cross sections directly impact the num-
ber of secondary positrons. For CR ﬂuxes, we take demodulated
proton and helium CR ﬂuxes measured by AMS-02 (Aguilar

N. Weinrich et al.: Galactic halo size in the light of recent AMS-02 data

et al. 2015a, 2017), and these data typically have uncertainties
in the 3 − 10% range. Also, not accounting for the production
from heavier CRs and species heavier than He in the ISM un-
derestimates the secondary positron ﬂux. Following the detailed
analysis of Boudaud et al. (2020) carried out for antiprotons, we
can estimate these eﬀects to be ∼ 10% and ∼ 3% respectively.

Concerning production cross-section uncertainties, we recall
that we use Kamae et al. (2006) parametrisation. More recent
values exist (Kachelrieß et al. 2019)—they are calibrated on
more recent collider data and include incident and target species
up to Fe—, but they are only valid for incident nucleus energy
greater than 4 GeV. Our analysis is mostly sensitive to the low-
energy part, so the latter model is only used to get a rough esti-
mate of the theoretical uncertainties in the production cross sec-
tions. The secondary positron ﬂux is 10-20% larger with Kachel-
rieß et al. (2019) than with Kamae et al. (2006) values.

Thirdly, we consider uncertainties from energy loss mod-

elling.
intermediate- and low-energies. Above a few tens of GeV, in-
verse Compton and synchrotron radiation losses have the short-
est timescales. Below a few MeV, ionisation and Coulomb
losses dominate, and in-between, Bremsstrahlung losses domi-
nate. However, some of the positrons measured below 10 GeV
have been produced at higher energy and at a more distant place.
Hence, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the hier-
archy in energy-loss timescales and impact on the positron ﬂux.
This motivates the detailed study of the impact of the various
ingredient entering these losses.

Changing the interstellar radiation ﬁeld (inverse Compton
losses) and the magnetic ﬁelds (synchrotron losses) according
to the values bracketed in Delahaye et al. (2010) have a ∼ 10%
impact at 1 GeV. Coulomb losses on free electrons only dom-
inate at very low energy, and we checked that the uncertainty
on ne = 0.033 ± 0.002 cm−3 (Nordgren et al. 1992)—see Yao
et al. (2017) for an updated model—has a negligible impact on
the positron ﬂux (sub-percent level) at 1 GeV.

Intermediate energies are dominated by Bremsstrahlung
losses on the ISM gas. The same gas density is responsible for
the production of secondary positrons. There is a further com-
plication as this very gas density also directly impacts the de-
termination of the transport coeﬃcients, and this is discussed in
the next paragraph. The gas density uncertainty is diﬃcult to as-
sess, and it can be probed for instance via the γ-ray emissivity
(e.g. Delahaye et al. 2011), especially in the light of Fermi-LAT
data (Ackermann et al. 2012, Casandjian 2015, and Acero et al.
2016). The impact of the choice of diﬀerent density maps was
recently investigated in Jóhannesson et al. (2018): between 2D
and 3D gas models, variations by a factor two on column den-
sity were found—this factor mostly comes from using an out-
dated value of the Sun’s position in one gas component of the
2D model, and it certainly overestimates the uncertainty on the
surface gas density (ΣISM). More realistically, the HI spin tem-
perature is already responsible for a 10% uncertainty in the gas
density (Jóhannesson et al. 2018), and other sources of uncer-
tainties come from the still debated XCO conversion value (Remy
et al. 2017) and the dark gas distribution (Grenier et al. 2005).
For deﬁniteness, we take a benchmark uncertainty of 50% on
ΣISM in the following.
If we consider together the impact on
the production and Bremsstrahlung, there should be no net ef-
fect in the regime where Bremsstrahlung losses dominate: The
gas density cancels out from the integral calculation, as it ap-
pears both in the numerator (production) and in the denominator
(propagation)—we stress however, that if primary electrons or
positrons are considered (no production), their ﬂux now scales

ﬁrst column list the quantities varied in the calculation, the second col-
umn provide the typical uncertainties on this ingredient, and the last
three columns show the corresponding uncertainty on the calculated IS
secondary ﬂux of positrons—the gas surface density impacts the calcu-
lation in diﬀerent places, and its impact is broken down below (see text
for details). A ‘+’ sign below (instead of ‘±’) means that our calculation
is conservative, that is, the secondary ﬂux would be larger if we were to
account for these speciﬁc ingredients. The exact numbers slightly de-
pend on the conﬁguration used (BIG, SLIM, or QUAINT) and we report
below values from QUAINT.

with the inverse of the gas density, as found in Cirelli et al.
(2013). We checked indeed that there is no impact of the gas
density for secondary positrons at 1 GeV. However, at higher en-
ergies, in a regime where other energy losses dominate, we also
ﬁnd, as expected, a direct scaling with the gas density.

Fourthly, we consider uncertainties from transport coeﬃcient
calibration. The positron ﬂux depends on the transport param-
eters, calibrated on secondary-to-primary ratios. For instance,
assuming a know ΣISM, the parameter K0 is determined with
a ∼ ±12% uncertainty (Weinrich et al. 2020). This leads to
a halved uncertainty on the positron ﬂux at very low energy
(∝ 1/
K0), but it fully propagates at 1 GeV. However, as dis-
cussed in Maurin et al. (2010), any uncertainty on ΣISM directly
translates on the transport parameters K0, Vc, and VA, a be-
haviour also observed in Jóhannesson et al. (2018). A ±50%
change on ΣISM would thus change K0 (and VA) accordingly,
which, combined with the impact on the positron production and
Bremsstrahlung, leads to an overall ±26% uncertainty on sec-
ondary positrons at 1 GeV, this number varying with the energy
(see above).

√

Fifthly, we consider uncertainties from Solar modulation.
Solar modulating the calculated positron ﬂux also brings uncer-
tainties. Above 100 GeV, CR ﬂuxes are mostly unmodiﬁed, and
TOA CRs below 1 GeV mostly come from CRs at ∼ GeV. As
a result, the error budget at 1 GeV applies to lower energies as
well for TOA positrons.

Modulation levels for most data in this analysis were taken
from Ghelﬁ et al. (2017b), that is, from averages—over the ap-
propriate CR data taking periods—of time series based on the
analysis of neutron monitor data. The fact that post-ﬁt values
in the LiBeB analyses (see the companion paper, Weinrich et al.
2020) were found to be consistent with the above assumed val-

et al. (2017b) time series do not extend after 2017. To derive
the positron modulation level φFF = 650 MV, we relied on Oulu
times series6, derived from Usoskin et al. (2005), and rescaled
according to φGhelﬁ17(t) ≈ φUsoskin05(t) + 100 MV, as found in
Ghelﬁ et al. (2017b). The overall uncertainties on reconstructed
modulation levels from neutron monitors are ±100 MV (Ghelﬁ
et al. 2017b). Those obtained from directly ﬁtting TOA (pre-
AMS) H and He data are in the ±30 MV range (Ghelﬁ et al.
2016). We choose a very conservative approach below, and for
1 GeV secondary positrons, the ±100 MV (±15%) uncertainty
translates into a ∓50% uncertainty. This makes modulation the
dominant source of uncertainty for the positron ﬂux calculation.
To conclude this section, we summarise our results on the
uncertainties. Although the above analysis does not reach the
level of reﬁnement developed for CR nuclei analyses (Derome
et al. 2019), we now have a quantitative grasp on the uncertain-
ties on the secondary positron calculations. They are gathered in
Table 4, where we also provide a ﬁner view of these uncertain-
ties at three energies (10 MeV, 1 GeV, and 100 GeV). At 1 GeV,
which is the energy that is relevant for the analysis below, uncer-
tainties from Solar modulation are the dominant eﬀect, followed
by those on production and ΣISM. Regarding production, we nev-
ertheless stress that the assumptions we make are conservative to
derive lower limits on L; they underestimate the positron ﬂux by
∼ 20 − 30% (10-20% from cross sections and 10% from unac-
counted for heavy CR projectiles).

4.2.3. Constraints on L

To check the compatibility with the limits set by AMS-02 Be/B
data, we carried out calculations for several L values. The lat-
ter are taken inside their allowed range (upper-half of Table 3).
To ensure a consistent calculation, the transport parameters are
rescaled with L according to Eq. (A.1) and values in Table A.1
(see App. A).

We set conservative limits on L by excluding propagation se-
tups for which the prediction of the secondary positron ﬂux ex-
ceeds the AMS-02 measurements (Aguilar et al. 2019a) by more
than 3σ in a single bin. In practice, for all our conﬁgurations, the
lowest-energy AMS-02 data point is the one setting constraints.
In a ﬁrst step, we check the consistency of the positron ﬂux
with the Be/B constraint. In Fig. 5, we report our predictions
for the secondary positron ﬂuxes (rescaled by E3) for the BIG,
SLIM, and QUAINT propagation models (left, middle, and right
panel, respectively) along with the AMS-02 data (Aguilar et al.
2019a). These predictions are derived using the best-ﬁt param-
eters inferred from the combined Li/C, Be/C, and B/C analy-
sis performed in Weinrich et al. (2020), already extensively dis-
cussed throughout the paper. For illustration, we have taken the
best-ﬁt values obtained for L from the AMS-02 Be/B data only
(see Table 3). In each panel, the solid curve corresponds to the
best-ﬁt value for L, bracketed by its 1σ statistical uncertainty
(dashed curve for the lower deviation, and dot-dashed curve for
the upper deviation).

Article number, page 10 of 15

From Fig. 5, we see that the positron constraint on L is only
relevant for the QUAINT propagation model. The latter has an
eﬀective Alfvèn speed VA ∼ 40 km/s (see Table A.1) which sets
the amplitude of reacceleration7. For the BIG and SLIM models
(left and middle panels), both devoid of reacceleration, the nom-
inal predictions undershoot the data. The low-energy behaviour
in these models is furthermore exacerbated by the low-rigidity
break in the diﬀusion coeﬃcient around 3 − 4 GV (Weinrich
et al. 2020): it leads to a lower secondary positron ﬂux at low
rigidities and hence a decreased constraining power on L. Given
the uncertainties on the calculation, only QUAINT can overshoot
the data, whereas BIG and SLIM cannot for L values constrained
by Be/B.

In a second step, we derive the upper-limit on L in the
model QUAINT. Our nominal 3σ constraint for QUAINT is
L ≥ 5.54 kpc. However, this number is very sensitive to the
model uncertainties. For illustration, we show in Fig. 6 the
impact of Solar modulation uncertainties, varying the Fisk po-
tential by a generous ±100 MV (Ghelﬁ et al. 2017b). The up-
per value of the modulation, which minimises the modulated
positron ﬂux, should be viewed as conservative, weakening the
limit to L ≥ 2.9 kpc. The lower value corresponds to a more
aggressive constraint (for a lower solar activity) L ≥ 11.3 kpc.
These limits do not account for sub-leading uncertainties dis-
cussed above. Without a better handle on the uncertainties, it
is diﬃcult to ﬁrmly conclude. Overall, we note that the positron
constraint on L for the QUAINT model is in agreement with those
derived from the Be/B and 10Be/9Be analysis, while being inde-
pendent from the latter.

We have only discussed the case of overshooting, which
provides a clear situation for excluding part of the parameter
space. Given that in the BIG and SLIM models the nominal
predictions undershoot the data, one may wonder if their via-
bility is questioned by the positron data. We remark that the var-
ious sources of uncertainties (modulation, production, surface
gas density), estimated at the (cid:46) 50% level at most, seem un-
able to fully account for the factor of ∼ 2 mismatch. However,
primary positrons, already necessary to explain the high-energy
positron fraction in pre-AMS-02 studies, might make up a sig-
niﬁcant fraction of the positron budget also at low energy—for
example, the absence of primary positrons at low energy was
raised as an important issue for astrophysical sources like pulsar
wind nebulae in Blasi & Amato (2011). Therefore, discussing
further the consistency of any propagation model (not only BIG
and SLIM) with the positron data should rely on analyses also
including primary positrons. This goes beyond the scope of this
paper.

5. Conclusions

In the context of recent high-precision AMS-02 data, we have
revisited the constraints set on the halo size of the Galaxy from
radioactive species and positron ﬂuxes.

Using AMS-02 Be/B data we ﬁnd L = 5+3

−2 kpc at 1σ, in
agreement with Boschini et al. (2020) (but with a larger error)
and less than one sigma away from the results of Evoli et al.

7 We stress that pre-AMS-02 ﬁt to B/C data (e.g. Maurin et al. 2001)
had larger VA. It was found that strong reacceleration gave rise to a
prominent bump around 1 GeV in the predicted positron ﬂux, which
then easily overshoots the data, especially below a few GeV (Delahaye
et al. 2009, Lavalle et al. 2014, and Boudaud et al. 2017). However,
with milder reacceleration here, we see in the right panel that the ﬂux
predictions associated with QUAINT are not in that strong excess with
respect to the data, and do not feature any signiﬁcant bump.

topes will certainly be even more challenging, but AMS-02 will
provide a unique picture in the few GeV/n regime, where only
ISOMAX and preliminary PAMELA data (Bogomolov & Vasi-
lyev 2019) are available for now, and shed some light on the mu-
tual consistency of these datasets. The balloon-borne HELIX,
should also provide a complementary view. The instrument is
scheduled for a long-duration balloon ﬂight in 2020/21, and is
expected to achieve a 10% statistical error on 10Be/9Be in the
0.1-10 GeV/n range (Park et al. 2019).

We have also performed a detailed analysis of the modelling
uncertainties for both the Be/B and 10Be/9Be ratios to understand
whether better data could help improving the estimation on L
in the future. Whereas Be/B is maximally sensitive to L at a
few tens of GV, 10Be/9Be is sensitive to L over a much larger
range (from 100 MeV/n to tens of GeV/n). In terms of possi-
ble improvements, Be/B data are already limited by systematics,
whereas this is not yet the case for 10Be/9Be. For these rea-
sons, 10Be/9Be seems to be the best target for future experiments.
However, in both cases, production cross-sections uncertainties
dominate the modelling error budget and are already at the level
of data uncertainties. Future improvements on L will thus not be
possible without improving nuclear data. An alternative strategy
to mitigate these uncertainties would be to combine data from
diﬀerent CR clocks (e.g. Al/Mg and Cl/Ar).

In a broader context of multi-wavelength and multi-
messenger observations, we also discussed the constraints set
by synchrotron radio (e.g. Di Bernardo et al. 2013) and diﬀuse
γ-ray emissions (e.g. Tibaldo et al. 2015) in the Milky-way (and
in some cases in other galaxies). The various observations lead
to lower or upper limits, deﬁning a broad range L ∈ [2, 10] kpc
compatible with results from radioactive CR nuclei. We also
updated the constraints set by positrons (Lavalle et al. 2014).
Since BIG and SLIM conﬁgurations undershoot the data, the con-
straints are only signiﬁcant for the QUAINT model, leading to
L ≥ 2.9 − 11.3 kpc depending on the solar modulation, with a
nominal central value L ≥ 5.5 kpc; these numbers could shift
upwards or downwards depending on uncertainties on the pro-
duction cross section and the gas surface density. Within the
errors, these constraints are also consistent with the ones derived
in the main analysis.

While our conclusions appear rather robust within the frame-
work of this analysis, one should keep in mind that these bounds

(2020). Our result holds for several transport conﬁgurations
(Derome et al. 2019; Weinrich et al. 2020), namely BIG (reaccel-
eration and low-rigidity break), SLIM (pure diﬀusion with low-
rigidity break), and QUAINT (reacceleration and diﬀusion up-
turn in the non-relativistic regime). The constraints are tighter
(factor ∼ 2 reduction in errors) and move to a lower value of L
(by 0.3-0.7 kpc) when low-energy 10Be/9Be data are considered,
but this tightening may be related to the fact that ISOMAX data
(Hams et al. 2004) prefer a smaller halo size L ≈ 3 kpc and might
be indicative of a tension in the data. With the recent release of
3He and 4He data (Aguilar et al. 2019b), AMS-02 demonstrated
its capabilities for measuring isotopic ﬂuxes. Separating Be iso-

might be altered in presence of inhomogeneities in the local gas
density (for radioactive species) and on the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
(for both radioactive species and positrons). These extensions
represent interesting and motivated subjects for future studies.

Appendix A: Scaling relations with L

In Sect. 3.2, we study the sensitivity to L of CR data combi-
nations involving a radioactive species. To do so, the transport
parameters obtained from the study of B/C must be known for
any L. In Sect. 4.2, we test whether secondary positrons over-
shoot the data given for various L, given the constraints set from
secondary-to-primary ratios and radioactive species. This is a
similar but slightly diﬀerent question than the previous one.

For each model (BIG, SLIM, and QUAINT), we repeat the
transport parameter ﬁtting procedure described in Weinrich et al.
(2020) at ﬁxed L for several values of L, for either the AMS-
02 B/C ratio only, or the combined AMS-02 Li/C, Be/B, and
B/C data. We show for the latter the resulting best-ﬁt transport
parameters (symbols) in Fig. A. We ﬁnd that a simple power law
is enough to capture the dependence with L (lines in Fig. A),

Param(L) = A ·

and we report the best-ﬁt A and B values found for each transport
parameter (δ, K0, etc.) in Table A.1 for the two diﬀerent cases.

A few comments are in order:
the B/C analysis are very similar to the ones found in Fig. 5 of
Putze et al. (2010), that is 1.06 for K0 and 0.53 for VA (from the
analysis of older B/C data). As argued in Putze et al. (2010),
a secondary-to-primary ratio provides constraints degenerated
A/L ratios. These small diﬀerences (1.06 vs
with K0/L and V 2
1 and 0.53 vs 0.5) originate in the small fraction of 10B ((cid:46) 10%)
coming from decayed 10Be, which is sensitive to L. Figure A.2
illustrates this sensitivity on the B/C ratio.
If the theoretical
rescaling is applied (grey lines), the curves with varying L are
either above or below the reference, converging to the reference
at high rigidity as 10Be half-life grows and 10Be behaves as a sta-
ble secondary species. At variance, when the above rescaling is
applied, the variation with L is absorbed in the ﬁt, and the high-
rigidity limit no longer goes to zero. The overall diﬀerence is at
the few percent level.

Appendix A.2: Difference between B/C and combined

analysis results

A similar scaling remains for the combined analysis (Li/C, Be/B,
B/C), but with some diﬀerences, that were all highlighted in
Weinrich et al. (2020). First, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient normali-
sation K0 is smaller than in the B/C only case, and the diﬀerence
is related to partial degeneracies with production cross sections,

that are lifted in the combined analysis of elements. The best-
ﬁt values are consistent, though slightly diﬀerent, from those in
Weinrich et al. (2020), and this is mostly attributed to the fact
that we ﬁt here the combination Be/B instead of Be/C. Second,
whereas for the B/C case BIG parameters are very similar to
QUAINT ones, for the combined analysis the BIG parameters are
closer to SLIM ones. Last, the low-energy parameters δl and η
are also diﬀerent from the B/C analysis only, and correspond to
more marked low-rigidity break of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient; we
ﬁnd here that the latter parameters have almost no dependence
on L.

Fig. A.2. Relative variation of B/C ratio (with respect to a reference
taken at L = 5 kpc), as a function of rigidity. Thin- to thick-dashed
lines correspond to calculations for various L using either (i) the ‘theo-
retical’ rescaling which enforce the same level of production for stable
secondary species (grey lines), or (ii) the rescaling based on a reﬁt of
B/C data for each L as described in the text (red lines).

Appendix B: L from several 10Be/9Be datasets
The 10Be/9Be ratio has been measured by diﬀerent experiments
in diﬀerent energy ranges. To better grasp the respective weight
of the data in the ﬁnal constraint (see Sect. 4), we show the dif-
ferent contributions to the ﬁt. We focus on SLIM, but similar
results are observed for BIG and QUAINT.

In Fig. B.1, we show the combined analysis of Li/C, B/C,
and diﬀerent datasets for 10Be/9Be. Fits on low-energy data only
are completely driven by ACE data (compare ﬁrst and second
column). They lead to larger L values than the higher-energy
ISOMAX data (third column). The latter have larger uncertain-
ties than low-energy data (see Fig. 3), so that low-energy data
drive the combined constraint (fourth column).

For completeness, we also show the constraints from the pre-
liminary PAMELA data (Bogomolov & Vasilyev 2019). They
cover a energy range of 0.1 to 2 GeV/n, combining two inde-
pendent analyses with the TOF and calorimeter, with a ∼ 20%
uncertainty. They give the best constraints on L (next-to-last col-

Fig. B.1.
Constraints on L (top panel) for combined ﬁt of AMS-
02 Li/C and B/C data, and various datasets for 10Be/9Be. From left
to right: low-energy ACE data, all low-energy data combined (ACE,
IMP7&8, ISEE3, Ulysses-HET, and Voyager), higher-energy GeV/n

umn), preliminary PAMELA data (Bogomolov & Vasilyev 2019), and
all combined (last column).

umn) with smaller error bars, in line with the expectations dis-
cussed of Sect. 3.2. Most importantly, they point towards smaller
values of the halo size than the other datasets, with L ∼ 2−3 kpc.
If all 10Be/9Be data are combined, the PAMELA data drive the
ﬁt (last column).

AMS-02 data will cover a similar range as PAMELA prelim-
inary data. With probably slightly smaller uncertainties, they are
expected to provide similar or slightly better precision on L. Be-
cause of the tension between PAMELA and lower-energy data,
the results from both experiments are crucial to be able to obtain
robust results on the central value of the halo size.

Appendix C: Constraints from 7Be/(9Be +10 Be)
Owing to the diﬃculty to achieve isotopic separation in CR ex-
periments, data analyses often start with the most favourable
conﬁguration. The Be element is made of 7Be, 9Be, and 10Be.

Fig. C.1. Same as Fig. 1, but for the variation of 7Be/(9Be+10Be) with
L (pinkish dashed lines), compared to various model uncertainties (con-
tours) and current data uncertainties (hatched boxes); data from AMS-
01 (Aguilar et al. 2011) and PAMELA preliminary analysis (Menn et al.
2018).

Taking advantage of the ∆A = 2 mass separation between A = 7
and A = 9, 10 isotopes, the 7Be/(9Be +10Be) ratio is experimen-
tally a favourable conﬁguration to analyse.

This ratio has been published by AMS-01 (Aguilar et al.
2011) and also by PAMELA (Menn et al. 2018). Following
similar steps as the analysis presented in Sect. 3.2, we show
in Fig. C.1 prospective limits on L that can be set from using
the 7Be/(9Be +10 Be) ratio. Because of the sub-dominant abun-
dance of 10Be in the denominator, this ratio is as sensitive to
L as the Be/B ratio. But whereas AMS-02 achieves a few per-
cent precision on Be/B, current experiment are at ∼ 15 − 20%
precision for isotopic ratios. For this reason, we conclude that
7Be/(9Be +10Be) is not a competitive target to ﬁx L with current
data or with future experiments.
