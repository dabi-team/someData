Primordial black holes, allegedly formed in the very early Universe, have been proposed as a possible
viable dark matter candidate. In this work we characterize the expected gravitational wave signal
detectable by the planned space-borne interferometer LISA and the proposed next generation space-
borne interferometer µAres arising from a population of primordial black holes orbiting Sgr A(cid:63),
the super-massive black hole at the Galactic center. Assuming that such objects indeed form the
entire diﬀuse mass allowed by the observed orbits of stars in the Galactic center ( <∼ 4 × 103 M(cid:12)
within a radius of (cid:39) 10−3 pc from Sgr A(cid:63)), under the simpliﬁed assumption of circular orbits and
monochromatic mass function, we assess the expected signal in gravitational waves, either from
resolved and non-resolved sources. We estimate a small but non negligible chance of (cid:39) 10% of
detecting one single 1 M(cid:12) primordial black hole with LISA in a 10-year-long data stream, while
the background signal due to unresolved sources would essentially elude any reasonable chance of
detection. On the contrary, µAres, with a (cid:39) 3 orders-of-magnitude better sensitivity at (cid:39) 10−5 Hz,
would be able to resolve (cid:39) 140 solar mass primordial black holes in the same amount of time, while
the unresolved background should be observable with an integrated signal-to-noise ratio (cid:38) 100.
Allowing the typical PBH mass to be in the range 0.01-10 M(cid:12) would increase LISA chance of
detection to (cid:39) 40% towards the lower limit of the mass spectrum. In the case of µAres, instead,
we ﬁnd a “sweet spot” just about 1 M(cid:12), a mass for which the number of resolvable events is indeed
maximized.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, partly motivated by the inconclusive re-
sults of many enterprises aimed at the detection of dark-
matter particles (for a review see, e.g., [1–3]), primor-
dial black holes (PBHs) gained increasing attention as a
possible candidate [4–7] for such an elusive component,
which accounts to 25% of the energy density of today’s
Universe.
The existence of PBHs as physical objects was ﬁrst pro-
posed in 1966 by Zeldovich [8], and in 1971 Hawking
similarly postulated how such objects could originate [9].
Current models trace the origin of PBHs to the collapse
of large density perturbations in the early Universe, usu-
ally in the post-inﬂation era t (cid:38) 10−38 s [10–14]. More
recent work on possible formation channels include: for-
mation by isocurvature perturbations, such as fragmen-
tation of a real scalar ﬁeld [15], resonant ampliﬁcation of
the curvature perturbations [16], vacuum tunneling dur-
ing inﬂation [17], and scalaron+χ models [18], among
others.
Ref. [19] ﬁrst proposed a simple relation between the typ-
ical mass of a newly formed PBH mPBH and its formation

While a lower limit on the current mass of a PBH is

exist, at least on a theoretical ground. It is worth men-
tioning that recent theoretical arguments by [21] suggest
that, under the assumption of a scale-invariant amplitude
of primordial curvature ﬂuctuations, the resulting PBH
mass spectrum should show a clear peak at
In terms of energy density, a ﬁrst order estimate of the

where ΩPBH and ΩCDM are the current density parameters
in PBHs and in cold dark-matter, respectively, while β is
the fraction of the Universe mass in PBHs at their for-
mation time. A number of diﬀerent techniques aimed at
determining upper limits on the PBH fraction as a dark
matter component have been proposed, namely gravita-
tional lensing, dynamical eﬀects, inﬂuence on large-scale
structure, accretion and gravitational waves (see [20] for
a recent review). In particular, [22] estimated the prop-
erties of a population of PBHs orbiting the supermas-
sive variety of BHs at the center of galaxies, deriving
the expected signal in gravitational waves (GWs). Af-
ter limiting the analysis to the case of Sgr A(cid:63), thanks
to existing scaling relations [23, 24] the authors of [22]
assessed the GW signal arising from the entire cosmic
population of galaxies. Further work on the detectability
of a GW stochastic background from PBHs can be found
in [25, 26].

the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), by consid-
ering the combined eﬀects of two-body relaxation and
GW losses, anchoring the PBH population to the one
key observational constraint given by GRAVITY [27].
In particular, we adopt the upper limit of the diﬀuse
mass allowed within the pericenter of the S2 star around
Sgr A(cid:63), i.e., (cid:46) 4
10−4 pc from
103 M(cid:12) within rS2 ≡

In Sec-

background of GW detection.
In Section IV, through
dedicated, extensive Monte-Carlo simulations, we esti-
mate the GW characteristic strain from such constrained
population of PBHs, considering observations performed
by the planned space-borne interferometer LISA [28] and
by the proposed next generation space-borne interferom-
eter µAres [29]. A distinction between resolved events
and stochastic background is also then carried out be-
fore calculating the corresponding signal to noise ratios.
Finally, Section V is dedicated to concluding remarks.

II. DENSITY DISTRIBUTION OF PBHS
AROUND SGR A(cid:63)

As in [22], we assume that a population of PBHs with
typical mass mPBH = 1 M(cid:12) constitutes a fraction of the
dark matter in the galactic center. As already pointed
out, recent theoretical developments by [21] indicate in-
deed 1 M(cid:12) as the preferred mass of PBHs (still, we will
relax the assumption on the mass later on). PBHs are
assumed to orbit Sgr A(cid:63) on purely circular orbits, and
are supposed to be initially distributed according to a
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) proﬁle [30]. Two-body re-
laxation then shapes the density proﬁle ρ(r) on a char-
acteristic timescale given by [31]

in the distribution shown in Fig. 2 is almost independent
of the actual value of mPBH.

In Eq. 16, the so-called noise spectral
density Sn(f ) (sometimes referred to as the noise spec-
tral sensitivity or spectral amplitude) has units [Hz−1],
and quantiﬁes the sensitivity of the GW detector. When
computing the expected GW signal detectable by LISA
we will adopt the noise spectral density reported in [38].
Although the sources that we consider are originated at
the Galactic center, we will use the sky averaged Sn(f ).

III. GRAVITATIONAL WAVE SIGNALS

In this section we introduce the observables we consider
in order to characterize the GW signal arising from the
population of PBHs described in the previous sections.
Both the frequency dependent strain amplitude h(f ) and
the interferometer sensitivity Sn(f ) in general depend
upon the position of the GW source in the sky relative
to the detector.
It is then useful to make the distinc-
tion between an “optimal case” and an “average case”,
in terms of the orientation of the source-detector sys-
tem. Following, e.g., [34], for an interferometer with non-
perpendicular arms such as LISA, letting α be the angle
between two arms, the detector beam pattern functions
F+ and F× are deﬁned as

F+(θ, φ, ψ) = sin α

In order to compute the GW signal arising from the
population of PBHs described in the previous sections,
we run a series of Monte-Carlo simulations randomly
sampling the underlying distribution with 4000 PBHs of
1 M(cid:12). From the sampled population we then compute
the resulting GW signal. We explicitly make a distinction
between resolved events and unresolved ones, the latter
combining to build-up a stochastic background. Our ﬁ-
nal results are then obtained by averaging the GW signal
over a statistically signiﬁcant number of simulations. In
the following, we analyse the two diﬀerent types of sig-
nals (resolved and background). All relevant ﬁgures are
reported in Table I.

FIG. 3: Sensitivities for LISA (dot-dashed line) and µAres
(dotted line) in the relevant frequency range.

A. Resolved events

it
While this choice is primarily driven by simplicity,
should be noted that PBHs are persistent sources and
their signal will build-up in the data stream for the whole
duration of the mission. Being the north ecliptic pole
tilted by approximately 60o with respect to the galac-
tic north pole and being the LISA constellation tilted by
60o with respect to the ecliptic, along the LISA orbit, the
galactic center will be seen at a variable inclination, span-
ning a wide range essentially from being face-on to being
edge-on. As for µAres, the proposed design features two
constellations in perpendicular planes, making the use of
sky-averaged sensitivity a reasonable compromise in both
cases.
Finally, we will add to the instrumental sensitivity curve
the background noise arising from the cosmic population
of white dwarf (WD) binaries [39, 40]. When forecasting
the GW signal in µAres data stream, we will take Sn(f )
from [29]; note that in this case the instrumental noise
already takes into account the WD background (see also
[41] for a recent take on an alternative technique to detect
stochastic backgrounds in the µHz band relying on binary
resonance probes).
The observation time tobs (i.e., the proper “data-taking”
time) for the LISA interferometer is currently set to be
(cid:38) 4.5 yrs long, though potentially 10 years of data could
be collected, if mission operations are extended and there
is no failure in the hardware. Similarly, for the proposed
µAres mission, at the time of writing a >
10-year long
∼
mission is foreseen. In the following section, we will refer
to tobs = 10 yrs for both interferometers.1 Fig. 3 shows
the sensitivities of LISA and µARES in the frequency
range relevant to our study.

1 Note that, given the monochromatic nature of our targets, results
are essentially unaﬀected if the data are obtained in a continuous
stream, rather than collected along a longer mission with a duty
cycle of less than 100%.

In estimating the distribution of resolved sources, we
deem an event “resolvable” whenever the two following
criteria are simultaneously satisﬁed:

• the event has SNR > 8;2

• no more than 1 event falls within a given frequency

resolution bin3 [37].

As a ﬁrst step, through Monte-Carlo simulations we ran-
domly select 4000 PBHs (so as to cope with the mass
constraints given by [27]) from the underlying distribu-
tion, constructing a catalog of potential sources. Then,
for each source in the catalog, we compute the GW signal
and its SNR according to the LISA and µARES sensitiv-
ities. As in a typical catalog realization LISA would re-
solve from zero to a maximum of 1 event, in order to have
a statistically signiﬁcant ﬁgure we run a total of 1,000
simulations. Fig. 4 shows the probability, computed over
1,000 Monte-Carlo realizations, that a catalog contains
a given number of resolved events. Regarding LISA, it
is apparent how the vast majority of realizations contain
no detection whatsoever, with few simulations resulting
11% probabil-
in just 1 event. Statistically, there is a
ity that one PBH might be resolved by LISA in 10 year
of data collection, with the remaining 89% probability of
null detection4.

(cid:39)

2 Circular EMRIs like the ones considered here are essentially
monochromatic sources featuring a waveform very similar to that
of galactic white dwarf binaries, for which resolvability down to
SNR
8 has been demonstrated in early LISA mock data chal-
≈
lenges [42].

3 The frequency resolution of the data is deﬁned as the inverse of
tobs, so that for tobs = 10 (4.5) yrs, the corresponding frequency
resolution will be 3 (7)

10−9 Hz.

4 Detection probabilities are only slightly modiﬁed by a change in
tobs, which in turn aﬀects the frequency bin width and the num-
ber of cycles in the characteristic strain. For instance, halving
tobs would reduce the SNR by a factor √2.

Given its much higher sensitivity at low frequencies, the
outcome for µAres is strikingly diﬀerent, resulting in an
140 detected PBHs in 10 years. The prob-
average of
ability distribution, again computed over 1,000 realiza-
tions, is well ﬁt by a Gaussian distribution with mean and
standard deviation of 139.6 and 9.7, respectively. Under
the assumption that the unresolved matter within the
Galactic center is entirely formed by PBHs, this means
that µAres would have a chance of 99.9% of resolving a
minimum of 110 solar-mass PBHs orbiting Sgr A(cid:63). Un-
der our assumption of circular orbits and inclination-and-
polarization averaged strain, there exist 1:1:1 relations
among the radial distance of a PBH to Sgr A(cid:63), its GW
frequency and the SNR of the event. From the source
catalogs we can then compute frequency and SNR distri-
butions, shown in Fig. 5. The distributions are obtained
adopting a logarithmic binning in frequency, and are nor-
malized so that the sum of the histogram heights gives
the average number of resolved events, i.e., 0.11 in the
case of LISA and 140 for µAres. Regarding LISA, all we
can say is that the single one event possibly resolved dur-
ing 10 years of data collection would have a higher chance
10−5
to fall in the frequency range 3.5
Hz, corresponding to 8 (cid:46) SNR (cid:46) 30. µAres, instead, will
produce a genuine distribution of resolved events, cover-
ing at least one decade in frequency with an SNR as large
as few hundreds.
Finally, we note that the detection statistics is mainly
driven by the SNR > 8 constraint, as for f (cid:38) 10−5 Hz
there are, on average, less than 1 PBH per frequency bin
anyway. This applies to both interferometers, although
in the case of µAres some overlap may occur in the lower
frequency bins, where the number of resolvable sources
is larger (Fig. 5, panel b).
The ﬁgures reported here, and in next § IV C as well,
would be only marginally aﬀected by a diﬀerent choice of
the SNR threshold. As an example, an SNR threshold of
5 would rather produce a (cid:46) 1% increase in the chances
of detection by LISA and a
5% increase in the number
of sources resolvable by µAres.

B. Stochastic background

Many PBHs, if not almost all as in the case of LISA, do
not satisfy the criteria for being resolvable. Still , their
cumulative GW signal could well produce a background
signal whose SNR would be above detection threshold.
In order to estimate the amplitude of the background
signal, we use Eq. (7) of [43],

In the above Eq. 18 the summation is intended over
the whole catalog excluding all resolved sources. As
discussed in [45], this is a somewhat optimistic ap-
proach, as it implicitly assumes a free-of-errors estimate
of source parameters, and a optimal waveform subtrac-
tion. The monochromatic nature of the PBHs considered
here makes this approach reliable.
In Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b we show hc,bkg(f ) for all unre-
solved sources in a 10-year-long stream of LISA and
µAres data, respectively. While at the lowest frequen-
cies the characteristic strain resembles that of a typ-
ical background noise, at higher frequencies the rela-
tively low number of sources gives the signal a “pop-
corn” ﬂavour, with frequency bins ﬁlled by more than
one source interloped by empty ones. It is interesting to
note how in the case of LISA, given its much lower sen-
sitivity, many high frequency sources are counted in the

sity proﬁle, vetting how our results depend upon the
speciﬁc choice of input parameters. Regarding possible
PBH masses connected to GW detection, we can limit
the pertaining parameter space as follows. Based on var-
ious current upper limits (see, e.g., [20]), a window ex-
ists between 10−16 and 10−11 M(cid:12) where 100% of dark
matter could be in the form of PBHs without violating
any observational constraint. However, such PBHs would
be much too light to enter the GW-dominated regime5.

This is true up until
to [20], the maximum allowed dark matter fraction in
the form of PBHs happens to be
1%. A more oper-
ational mass limit for PBHs can be set by considering
the minimum mass orbiting Sgr A(cid:63) at the ISCO (i.e. at
10−6 pc) whose GW losses are above the detection

threshold. Such mass turns out to be (cid:38) 5

non-resolved pool, and hence do contribute to the back-
ground. For µAres, instead, sources at high frequencies
(and hence high strains) will be always resolvable, con-
sequently the background will not extend in the 10−5 Hz
regime. The eﬀect is apparent also when we plot the ex-
pected probability density distribution of the background
SNR (Eq. 17), shown in Fig. 7a in the case of LISA, and
in Fig. 7b in the case of µAres. The results are again ob-
tained averaging over 1,000 simulation runs, and refer to
a 10-year-long data stream. The stochastic background
in the case of LISA spans a quite large range in SNR, but
it still has a very low chance to be detectable during the
mission lifetime. On the contrary, in the case of µAres
the whole of unresolved sources combine to produce a
GW background which would be observable with a SNR
of few hundreds.

C. Dependence upon PBH mass and density

typical mass of PBHs, and the details of the mass den-

bears important consequences when forecasting detection
ﬁgures. Results of our analysis are reported in Table I,
where all the tested cases are summarized. Generally
speaking, when we change mPBH, we are dealing with
two competing eﬀects: on the one hand lighter PBHs
are more numerous, on the other hand the GW signal
from a single source is weaker. On top of that, the GW
signal has to be folded into the sensitivity curve of the
interferometer under consideration.
It is the interplay
among these three eﬀects that sets the outcome of the
experiment that we performed. Having this in mind, it is
more practical discussing results for LISA and µAres sep-
arately. In the case of LISA, it is apparent that the larger
the number of PBHs (i.e., the lower mPBH), the larger the
number of resolved events, in agreement with naive ex-
pectations. Indeed, the low frequency sensitivity of LISA
scales approximately as f −2.5 (see Fig. 3) and, according
to [47], this would produce a number of resolved events
m3/5
Nres
PBH,
. An increase of 3 dex in mPBH would
then Nres
then result in a decrease of resolved events of a factor
7, in line with our ﬁndings. Note however that, for
≈
tobs = 10 yrs, we ﬁnd Nres < 1, i.e., we can merely inter-
pret such number as a probability of detecting a single
resolved event during the mission. Such probability is
as large as 60% in the case of mPBH = 0.01 M(cid:12) with an
isothermal proﬁle. Note also that while the Spiked NFW
and isothermal cases give comparable results, the shallow
Bahcall-Wolf distribution reduces the probability of de-
tection by an order of magnitude. Rather interestingly,
the median SNR of the possible detection is very similar
in all tested cases.
Concerning the possibility of a LISA detection of back-
ground noise arising from the population of PBHs,
though the SNR increases for lower masses, none of our
models predict a statistically signiﬁcant stochastic signal
in the LISA data stream.
For µAres results are somewhat less straightforward. In
this case (see Fig. 3) the sensitivity curve features a sort
10−5.5 Hz, basically shaped by the WD
of plateau for f >
∼
stochastic background. For large values of mPBH, Nres is
determined by the steep slope of the sensitivity curve for
f (cid:46) 10−5.5 Hz. This is because in this case the GW sig-
nal is strong enough that PBHs enter the observability
band well below 10−5.5 Hz. Reducing the typical PBH
mass would then increase Nres, because of the very same
reason seen in the case of LISA. However this is true only
down to a certain mass, for which PBHs start entering the
observability band above 10−5.5 Hz, i.e., in the ﬂat part
of the sensitivity curve. Further lowering the mass would
lead more and more sources to fall well below detectabil-
ity threshold. The combined eﬀects of PBH typical mass
and sensitivity then creates a “sweet spot” for Nres hap-
pening to be just around mPBH (cid:39)
1 M(cid:12), as reported in
Table I. As in the case of LISA, the shallow Bahcall-Wolf
proﬁle gives an order of magnitude less detections. Still,
even in this unfavorable circumstance, only for the lowest
PBH mass the number of resolved events in 10 years is

the time to coalescence at the peak of the density distri-
bution (i.e., where most of the PBHs would be) exceeds
the Hubble time. Having considered all this, we redo
our analysis allowing the PBHs to have masses as low as
0.01 M(cid:12), for which the maximum possible dark matter
fraction in PBHs is between a few and 10%, and as large
as 10 M(cid:12), for which similar constraints exist [20]. Note
that the ﬁxed total mass allowed in our models sets the
number of PBHs orbiting Sgr A(cid:63) to 4000 M(cid:12)/mPBH. We
also change the PBH density distribution ρ(r), testing
two alternative models, diﬀerent from the Spiked NFW
r−2,
proﬁle adopted so far: an isothermal proﬁle, ρ(r)
r−7/4 [46], again nor-
and a Bahcall-Wolf proﬁle, ρ(r)
malized to 4000 M(cid:12) within the S2 pericenter, and again
shaped in the inner region by GW losses. The resulting
distributions are shown in Fig. 2. It is important to no-
tice that while for the Spiked NFW case the peak of the
number distribution is at the sink radius rsink (i.e., the
distance form Sgr A(cid:63) where two-body relaxation and GW
timescales are equal), in the case of an isothermal proﬁle
we have the same number of PBHs at every r > rsink ,
and that for a Bahcall-Wolf proﬁle the higher PBH den-
sity occurs at the largest allowed distance. This very fact

radii. As can be easily understood by comparing e.g. to
our Fig. 2, this is way too close to Sgr A(cid:63) to prove useful
for telling 1 M(cid:12) PBHs and stars apart. For comparison,
at a distance of 10−5 pc, which is well within the range of
Fig. 2, the typical stars that would be tidally disrupted
14 M(cid:12)
would be ones like S2 (i.e. a B0 star with mass
7 R(cid:12)). Clearly, tidal eﬀects can be more
and radius
subtle, as a deformed star, even if not disrupted, would
show characteristic tidal eﬀects in the gravitational wave-
forms. However, those would only be observable if the
source frequency is evolving (cf. the discussion on the
mass estimate right above). Even more diﬃcult would
be to distinguish a neutron star from a PBH of similar
mass; only in the case of a pulsar would such distinction
be easily performed.
These preliminary considerations show that, although
the detection of PBHs in the GC might be feasible in the
future, recognizing their PBH nature might not be at all
straightforward. In future work, we will therefore study
in more detail the parameter estimation capabilities of
LISA and µAres, focusing on the distinctness between
PBHs and stars/brown dwarfs. Additionally, we will also
assess the impact of eccentric PBH orbits on our results.
In fact, a relaxed isotropic cusp of PBHs in the Galactic
center is expected to feature a thermal eccentricity dis-
tribution, i.e. p(e)
e. Therefore, despite GW-driven
circularization, we expect the overall signal to be domi-
nated by eccentric sources. The importance of eccentric-
ity is twofold. On the one hand, eccentric sources emit
at higher frequencies, which might signiﬁcantly increase
the chances of LISA to see such systems. On the other
hand, eccentric sources evolve much more rapidly, thus
allowing for a better determination of the source mass,
therefore helping the assessment of the source nature.
In closing, we underline that, compared to LISA and
µAres, thanks to their sensitivity at higher frequencies
ground-based interferometers such as the next Einstein
Telescope [50] will play a complementary role in the
search for GWs emitted by PBHs, e.g., in the detec-
tion of binaries of such objects [51, 52].
Indeed, the
prospects of genuine multi-frequency GW observations
[43] will greatly increase our chances of testing the exis-
tence of such an elusive population of black holes.

below unity. Finally, regarding background detectability,
in all cases µAres would produce a signal with a very
high SNR.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

(cid:39)

If a distribution of PBHs is present in our Galaxy, it
might concentrate at the Galactic center, where these ob-
jects would be expected to orbit around the central mas-
sive black hole Sgr A(cid:63), thus constituting possible sources
for gravitational wave detectors. Assuming a stationary
distribution of PBHs subject to two-body relaxation and
gravitational-wave driven infall toward Sgr A(cid:63), and com-
plying with the mass limits posed by S2 pericenter preces-
sion [27], we have computed the expected (resolved and
unresolved) GW signal detectable by future space-borne
observatories such as LISA and µAres. Although simpli-
ﬁed, our model shows that there is a
10% chance for
LISA to resolve a 1 M(cid:12) primordial black hole during a 10
years observation time, while even less likely is the detec-
tion of a background signal. A solid chance of detection
might instead be expected from the proposed space-borne
interferometer µAres, whose higher sensitivity would al-
low one to resolve from several to more than one hundred
PBHs, regardless of the actual typical mass or density
proﬁle, and to detect an unresolved background with a
signal to noise ratio well above detection threshold.
Another important question has to do with inferring the
nature of the detected sources. In other words, should
LISA detect a 1 M(cid:12) source orbiting Sgr A(cid:63), will it be pos-
sible to distinguish between a primordial black hole from
an astrophysical object, such as a star, or a brown dwarf?
First, we should notice that measuring the (chirp) mass of
a source (and thus the mass of the PBH) is only possible
if the frequency is evolving, i.e., if the source is not com-
pletely monochromatic. From the quadrupole formula,
the source frequency’s rate of change is [48]

fore, we do not expect the mass of the PBH candidate
to be measurable for all the detected events. Even for
the events with measurable mass, a possible astrophysi-
cal origin should be considered. To distinguish between a
star and a PBH, one may consider tidal eﬀects. In more
