Abstract 

The fall of the Annama meteorite occurred early morning (local time) on April 19, 2014  on the Kola Peninsula (Russia). Based 

on mineralogy and physical properties, Annama is a  typical H  chondri te. It has a  high Ar-Ar age of 4.4 Ga.  Its cosmic ray 

exposure history is atypical as it is not part of the large group of H chondrites with a prominent 7 – 8 Ma peak in the exposure 

age histograms. Instead, its exposure age is within uncertainty of a smal ler peak at 30  ±4 Ma.  The results from short-lived 

radionuclides are  compatible with  an  atmosperic pre-entry radius  of  30  –  40 cm.  However, based  on  noble  gas  and 

cosmogenic radionuclide data, Annama must have been part of a larger body (radius >65 cm) for a large part of its cosmic ray 

exposure history. The 10Be concentration indicates a recent (3 – 5 Ma) breakup which may be responsible for the Annama 

parent body size reduction to 30 – 35 cm pre-entry radius. 

Introduction 

The fall of the Annama meteorite occurred early morning (local time) on April 19, 2014  on the Kola Peninsula (Russia), close 

to the Finnish border. The event is also known as the Kola fireball ( Gritsevich et al. 2014a). The fireball was observed by the 

Finnish Fireball Network as well as by numerous eyewitnesses in Finland and local residents. The strewnfield was computed 

from the observations by the Finnish Fireball Network and a calibrated video ( taken by Alexandr Nesterov in Snezhnogorsk, 

Russia), details are provided in Gritsevich et al. (2014b). The fireball observations and heliocentric orbit reconstruction are 

detailed in Trigo-Rodríguez et al. (2015), Dmitriev et al. (2015). The fireball data interpretation was done using the fb_entry 

program (Lyytinen and Gritsevich 2013)  taking into account the atmospheric conditions present during the meteorite fall 

(Lyytinen and Gritsevich 2016). The derived characteristic parameters as well as the terminal height of the fireball indicated 

the possibility of surviving meteorite fragments reaching the ground (Gritsevich et al. 2012,  Moreno-Ibáñez et al. 2015). The 

pre-entry mass of the Annama meteoroid was estimated based on the deceleration analysis as described by Gritsevich (2008, 

2009) to be in the range of 400 – 500 kg (Trigo-Rodríguez et al. 2015, Lyytinen and Gritsevich 2016), with corresponding radius 

around 30 – 35 cm. 

Annama collided with the Earth on an Apollo-type orbit (Trigo-Rodríguez et al. 2015, Dmitriev et al. 2015) and at the time 

of its fall it was the 23rd  meteorite and 10th  H chondrite with known heliocentric orbit (http://www.meteoriteorbits.info/, 

retrieved November 10, 2016). 

In May 2014,  a meteorite recovery expedition was organized to the predicted landing area (Gritsevich et al. 2014b).  Two 

meteorites (Fig. 1) referred to as Annama I (120.4 g) and Annama II (47.5 g) were found only about 100  meters from the 

predicted fall line on May 29 and May 30, respectively. 

Materials and methods 

Optical and scanning electron microscopy 

Two  polished thin sections (265  and  220 mm2)  of  Annama I  were  prepared for  study  of  the  meteorite petrography, 

mineralogy and micro-chemical composition. For final polishing Struers OPU colloidal silica suspension was used. The first

thin section (265 mm2) was coated by 25 nm thick conductive layer of carbon for the purposes of microanalytical studies. The 

second thin section was used also to study optical features by a LEICA DLMP petrographic microscope. 

A scanning electron microscope (SEM) TESCAN MIRA 3GMU at the Czech Geological Survey, Czech Republic, was used for 

microanalytical studies and collection of backscattered electron images. Mineral compositions were determined using an 

Oxford Instruments AZtec Energy  Automated analytical system with  a  SDD  X-ray  energy dispersive  detector X-MaxN  80 

Premium (EDS) and a X-ray wavelength dispersive detector Wave 700 (WDS). Both analytical systems installed on the SEM 

were used for simultaneous EDS-WDS analysis. Analyses were performed using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, 20 nA beam 

current, 0.120  µm beam size and XPP matrix correction procedures. Acquisition live time for analysis of major elements by 

EDS  was 60 s and  the output count rate was 1.1  x 105  counts per second. Counting times for analysis of minor and trace 

elements by WDS system were 20  or 30 s. To  avoid Na and K  ions migration during the analysis of plagioclase, the beam 

diameter was enlarged to 5 µm. For simultaneous EDS-WDS analysis a combination of natural and synthetic standards was 

used for standardization and calibration process. 

An integrated electron backscattered diffraction system (EBSD) Oxford Instruments AZtec HKL Automated and Nordlys Nano 

detector, installed on  abovementioned SEM  was  used for  confirmation of  microstructural characteristics of  the studied 

minerals. Analytical conditions were 15 mm working distance, 20 kV accelerating voltage and 3.5 nA beam current. 

For metallographic purposes, a 220 mm2 polished section of Annama I was studied at the Ural Federal University, Russia. 

The structure of metal particles was revealed by etching with 2% HNO 3 solution. Samples were studied using an Axiovert 40 

MAT  (optical microscopy) and  a  Carl Zeiss ΣIGMA  VP (SEM). Optical data were processed using a  Panoramic Microscopy 

System SIAMS MT. 

X-ray diffraction 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a 88 mg powdered sample of Annama II at the Ural Federal University 

using a XRD-700  diffractometer (Shimadzu) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA with CuKα radiation and silicon monochromator, 

scanned over 2Θ from 13° to 85° with a step of 0.05° per 7 s. 

Raman spectroscopy 

Micro-Raman spectra were recorded at the Institut de Ciència de Materials de Barcelona (ICMAB - CSIC) in backscattering 

geometry at room temperature using the 5145  Å line of an Argon-ion laser with a Jobin-Yvon T-64000 Raman spectrometer 

attached to an Olympus microscope and equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector. 71 spots of different regions 

and minerals were analyzed with this technique. Analysis spot was ~1 μm and the laser power on the sample was kept below 

0.5 mW to avoid degradation. This setup allowed for high-resolution spectra acquisition in range of 100 – 1400 cm-1. 

Density and porosity 

The  bulk volume was determined at the  Department of  Physics, University of Helsinki, using a  modified Archimedean 

method (Consolmagno  and Britt  1998,  Macke  et  al.  2010)  incorporating glass  beads ~ 0.3 mm  in diameter. Ten  sets of 

 
 
 
 
Cite as: Kohout et al. 2017.  Meteoritics & Planetary Science, 52, 1525-1541.  dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12871 

measurements per sample were performed. The method was thoroughly tested and calibrated prior to the measurements 

using volume standards and the absolute resolution and precision were determined to be ±0.1 cm3. The grain volume was 

measured using a Quantachrome Ultrapyc 1200e He pycnometer. The absolute resolution and the precision of this device are 

estimated to be ±0.05 cm3. Mass was determined using a digital OHAUS Navigator scale with 0.1 g resolution and precision. 

The scale was calibrated prior to the measurements using internal calibration. 

Magnetic susceptibility 

The  room temperature magnetic susceptibility was measured in the  field upon recovery of  the meteorites using a  ZH 

instruments SM-30 portable surface susceptibility meter with a large 5 cm coil operating at 8 kHz frequency. The values were 

corrected for the actual sample size following the procedure described in Gattacceca et al. (2004). Later, the susceptibility 

was verified in the laboratories at the University of Helsinki and at the Ural Federal University using a ZH instruments SM-100 

susceptibility meter operating at 8 kHz frequency and 320 A/m RMS field amplitude. 

The susceptibility of the samples was measured three times along three perpendicular directions. Subsequently, a logarithm 

of the average apparent magnetic susceptibility (in 10-9 Am2/kg) was calculated as described in Rochette et al. (2003). The 

relative error in the determined value of the magnetic susceptibility logarithm is below 3%.  

Gamma-ray spectroscopy (GRS) 

The concentrations of short- and medium-lived cosmogenic radionuclides, as well as long-lived cosmogenic 26Al and natural 

radioactivity (40K,  232Th,  235U),  were  measured  on  a  6.58  g  sample  from  Annama  II  using  non-destructive gamma-ray 

spectroscopy in the STELLA (SubTErranean LowLevel Assay) facility of underground laboratories at the Laboratori Nazionali 

del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy, using a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector of 518 cm3 (Arpesella 1996). The measurement 

was done 101  days after the fall and the counting time was 34.61  days. The counting efficiencies were calculated using a 

Monte Carlo code. This code is validated through measurements and analyses of samples of well -known radionuclide activities 

and geometries. The uncertainties in the radionuclide activities are dominated by the uncertainty in the counting efficiency, 

which is conservatively estimated at 10%. Because actual data for Annama were not yet available, the average H Chondrite 

density and composition were taken from Britt  and Consolmagno (2003), and from Jarosewich (1990),  respectively. Exact 

values determined later for Annama are almost identical and thus this approach has no influence on results . 

Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 

A 68 mg sample from Annama I was used for cosmogenic radionuclide separation at the UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Lab 

and subsequent measurement at PRIME Lab at Purdue University. For the analysis of cosmogenic 10Be (half-life 1.36 x 106 a), 

26Al (7.05 x 105 a) and 36Cl (3.01 x 105 a), we crushed the 68 mg aliquot in an agate mortar and separated the magnetic (metal) 

fraction (~15 mg) and non-magnetic (stone) fraction (~50 mg) with a  magnet. We dissolved 49.9 mg  of the stone fraction, 

along with 2.95 mg of Be and 3.70 mg of Cl carrier, in concentrated HF/HNO3. After dissolution, we separated the Cl fraction 

as AgCl and purified the AgCl for isotopic analysis by AMS. The solution was evaporated to dryness, thereby removing Si as 

 
 
 
 
Cite as: Kohout et al. 2017.  Meteoritics & Planetary Science, 52, 1525-1541.  dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12871 

SiF4. After fuming with HClO4, the residue was dissolved in dilute HCL, and a ~3% aliquot was taken for chemical analysis by 

ICP-OES. We added 5.35 mg of Al carrier and separated Be and Al using ion exchange and acetyl -acetone extraction methods 

described previously (Welten et al., 2011). The 10Be/Be, 26Al/Al and 36Cl/Cl ratios of the samples were measured by accelerator 

mass spectrometry at the Purdue University PRIME Lab (Sharma et al. 2000). The measured ratios were corrected for blanks 

(<1% correction) and normalized to 10Be, 26Al and 36Cl AMS standards (Sharma et al., 1990,  Nishiizumi 2004, Nishiizumi et al. 

2007). 

Noble gases and nitrogen 

The first round of noble gas (He, Ne, Ar) analyses was done at the noble gas laboratory of ETH Zurich, Switzerland, on samples 

from Annama I, referred in the text as Annama Ia (114 mg) and Annama Ib (54 mg) using a protocol most recently described 

in detail by Meier et al. (2017). Samples were pre-heated at 100°C  for 24 hours in ultra-high vacuum (10-10 mbar) to remove 

potentially adsorbed atmospheric gases. The gas was then extracted in a single temperature step at ~1700°C  in a  furnace 

heated by electron bombardment. He and Ne were separated from Ar using a cold trap held at the temperature of liquid 

nitrogen. Sample measurements were bracketed by blank  measurements, and blanks subtracted  from  the sample and 

calibration gas signals. The blank contribution to the released sample gas was <1% for all He, Ne isotopes, and <15% for Ar 

isotopes. 

The second round of noble gas (He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe) analyses as well as a nitrogen analysis was done on a 74.69 mg sample 

of Annama I referred in the text as Annama Ir. The mass spectrometric measurements were performed on a ‘Noblesse’ (Nu 

Instruments U.K.) multi collector noble gas  mass spectrometer at Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, India using 

standard procedures (Mahajan 2015,  Mahajan et al.  2016).  Extraction was performed in four temperature steps, 600°C, 

900°C, 1200°C  and 1700°C  in a resistance furnace. The blank levels (at 1700°C, in units of 10-11 cm3STP) were 223, 4.89, 3.39, 

0.0457,  and 0.000166  for 4He, 22Ne, 36Ar, 84Kr and 132Xe, respectively. For nitrogen, the blank contribution to the total signal 

was ~2%. 

Ar-Ar dating 

A 48.8  mg whole rock sample from Annama I was cleaned with pure ethanol and wrapped into high-purity Al-foil and placed 

in  an  evacuated quartz  vial, bracketed by  NL25  hornblende  age  standards  (2657  ±4 Ma,  Schwarz and  Trieloff  2007).  In 

addition, one CaF2-standard was added to account for  Ca interference reactions. Subsequently, the sample was neutron-

irradiated with Cd-shielding at the Portuguese Research Reactor in Bobadela for 96 h (corresponds to a neutron flux of ca. 2·x 

1018 n/cm²). Argon analyses followed the procedure given by Hopp et al. (2014). Blank for the 40Ar were interpolated for each 

temperature step from measured blank assuming an exponential increase in gas amount. Observed b lank concentrations of 

40Ar were (in 10-10 cm³  STP) 1.25  ±0.02  at 800°C,  6.30  ±0.04  at 1200°C,  34.5  ±0.2  at  1400°C  and 325.5  ±1.7  at 1700°C.  The 

isotopic composition of the blank was indistinguishable from atmospheric composition within uncertainty. For the 700°C 

extraction we applied a significantly elevated blank correction of 90 ±9·10-10 cm³ STP to account for an additional blank during 

melting of the Al-foil. This value is an interpolation and assumes a linear change in observed 38Ar/36Ar and 40Ar/36Ar-ratios of

successive extractions. For evaluation we used the recommended decay parameters given in Steiger and Jäger (1977). Note, 

that at 4.5 Ga the age bias between the U-Pb and K-Ar timescales may cause an correction towards older ages of about 20 – 

30 Ma  of our reported Ar-Ar age (Renne et al. 2011,  Schwarz et al. 2011).  Correction parameters for interference reactions 

with  K  and  Ca  were  (38Ar/39Ar)K =  0.01465  ±0.00100,  (40Ar/39Ar)K  =  0.0123  ±0.0024,  (36Ar/37Ar)Ca =  0.00030  ±0.00016, 

(39Ar/37Ar)Ca = 0.00079 ±0.00001,  (40Ar/37Ar)Ca = 0.003 ±0.003. The J-value was 0.004741 ±0.000030  (internal error) / ±0.000033 

(external error). Results of our  Ar-Ar analyses are  listed in  Table S1  in Supporting Information. The data  are  blank and 

interference corrected (for K and Ca) but still not deconvolved into spallation and trapped components. However, for isochron 

calculations correction for spallation was applied. 

Mössbauer spectroscopy and magnetization measurements 

An 88 mg powdered sample of Annama II glued on an iron free Al-foil (the sample had a thickness of ~8 mgFe/cm2) was used 

for  Mössbauer spectroscopy with high  velocity resolution. The Mössbauer  spectrum was  measured at  the  Ural  Federal 

University using an automated precision Mössbauer spectrometric system built on the base of the SM-2201  spectrometer 

with  a  saw-tooth  shape  velocity  reference  signal  formed  by  the  digital -analog  converter  with  discretization  of  212 

(quantification with 4096 steps). Details of the instrument can be found in Oshtrakh et al. (2009), Semionkin et al. (2010), and 

Oshtrakh and Semionkin (2013). The ~ 109 Bq 57Со(Rh) source (Ritverc GmbH, St. Petersburg) was used at room temperature. 

The measurement was carried out in transmission geometry with a moving absorber at 295 K and recorded in 4096 channels. 

Then this spectrum was converted into the 1024-channel spectrum by a consequent summation of four neighboring channels 

to  increase the signal-to-noise ratio for  the  minor spectral  components. The statistical count rate  in  the 1024-channel 

Mössbauer spectrum of Annama H5 ordinary chondrite was 19.6  x 106 counts per channel and the signal-to-noise ratio was 

239. The Mössbauer spectrum was fitted with the least squares procedure using the UNIVEM-MS program with a Lorentzian 

line shape. A new approach to fit the troilite magnetic spectral component using the simulation of the full static Hamiltonian 

was applied as already reported by Maksimova et al. (2016b, 2017). Spectral parameters such as isomer shift (δ), quadrupole 

splitting (quadrupole shift for magnetically split components) (ΔEQ), magnetic hyperfine field (Heff), line width (Γ), relative area 

of  spectral  components (A), and  statistical criterion (χ2) were determined. An  instrumental (systematic) error for  each 

spectrum point was ±0.5 channel (in mm/s), the instrumental (systematic) error for the hyperfine parameters was ±1 channel 

(in mm/s or kOe). If the statistical error calculated with the fitting procedure (fitting error) for these parameters exceeded 

the instrumental (systematic) error the larger error was used instead. The criteria for the best fit were differential spectrum, 

χ2, and physical meaning of the spectral parameters. Values of δ are given relative to α-Fe at 295 K. 

The Mössbauer data analysis was further supported by optical and electron microscope observations of a small thin section 

from Annama II carried out by means of an Axiovert 40 MAT optical microscope (Carl Zeiss) and an Auriga CrossBeam SEM 

(Carl Zeiss) with an X-max 80 EDS device (Oxford Instruments) at the Ural Federal University. 

Field cooled (FC) and  zero  field cooled (ZFC) curves of  induced magnetization (at 250  Oe  field) as  well as  isothermal 

magnetization M(H) curves (at 5 K) were measured using a SQUID magnetometer MPMS-5S (Quantum Design) at the Hebrew 

University, Israel on a 6.2 mg powdered sample from Annama II.

Results 

Petrography, mineralogy, shock features, and physical properties 

Upon recovery, the 120.4  g Annama I meteorite was ~70% covered with black fusion crust and with apparent stream lines 

on one side (Fig. 1). The fresh surface was bright with abundant thin dark impact melt veins. The 47.5 g Annama II meteorite 

was fully covered with dark fusion crust. 

Annama  has  a  recrystallized  fine-grained granular  texture.  Chondrules  (200  –  3000  µm  in  diameter) are  composed 

predominantly of olivine and pyroxene and their shapes are mostly readily delineated (Fig. 2). Their types include radial 

pyroxene (RP), barred  olivine (BO), and  cryptocrystalline (CC) chondrules. Irregular fractures in  olivine and  undulatory 

extinction of olivine and plagioclase (no maskelynite was detected by EBSD) indicate a shock stage S2 based on the scale by 

Stöffler et al. (1991). Thin veins of impact melt are also present. No weathering products were observed (W0). 

EDS-WDS show an olivine composition Fa18.6 ±0.3 (N=60) and low-Ca pyroxene composition Fs16.6 ±0.2 and Wo1.26 ±0.26 

(N=65).  Also  present are  diopside (Fs6Wo46),  plagioclase (Ab80An14Or6),  troilite, kamacite, taenite, tetrataenite,  and 

chromite. Accessory minerals include chlorapatite, hercynite,  ilmenite, merrillite, and native copper. Classification of the 

chondrite as type H5 was made following criteria published in Huss et al. (2006) (Fig. 3). 

The XRD pattern of the Annama H5  fragment is shown in Fig. 4. An analysis of XRD data using full profile Rietveld analysis 

shows the presence of the following phases: olivine (~38.6 wt%), orthopyroxene (~36.6 wt%), α-Fe(Ni, Co) phase (~9.0 wt%), 

troilite (~5.6 wt%), anorthite (~4.7 wt%), chromite (~2.7 wt%), clinopyroxene (~1.4 wt%), -Fe(Ni, Co) phase (~1.3 wt%) and 

hercynite  (~0.2 wt%).  The  unit  cell  parameters  for  olivine  are:  а=10.2476(9) Å,  b=6.0026(7) Å,  c=4.7671(5)  Å  and  for 

orthopyroxene are: а=18.2746(8) Å, b=8.8493(7)  Å, c=5.2044(7)  Å. The Fe2+ occupancies of the M1  and M2  sites in silicates 

were also determined from the XRD pattern analysis. These values  are XFe

M1=21 and XFe

M2=17  for olivine and XFe

M1=6  and 

XFe

M2=48  for orthopyroxene. 

Metallographic image analysis of 2740 metal and troilite grains shows that relative metal area is 6.01% (corresponding to 

approx. 15  –  20  wt%) and  relative troilite  area is  1.66%.  Troilite is mostly present as  small grains as  one can  see from 

distribution of metal and troilite particle sizes shown in Fig. 5.  The metal grains are  composed predominantly (96.5%) of 

kamacite, while zoned (cloudy taenite) metal is sparse (3.5%). Kamacite forms larger grains (largest observed 5 x 1.5 mm), 

while zoned taenite particles are usually smaller, have complex structure and associate with troilite.  

Pure metallic copper inclusions were observed as individual grains in contact with troilite ( Fig. 6) or in a form of precipitations 

inside zoned taenite particles. This structure is typical for the zoned polycrystalline particles within H chondrites (as obs erved 

for example in Okhansk H4, Grokhovsky 1988). 

All zoned taenite particles contain cloudy zone formed during spinodal decomposition in metal areas with 40 – 45% of Ni. 

The cooling rate of this metal grains could be defined by the Ni -rich phase average size within the cloudy taenite zone as 

described by Goldstein (2009). The average size of these particles near the tetrataenite phase is 80 nm (Fig. S1 in Supporting 

Information), which corresponds to a cooling rate of about 20 K/Ma below 350°C. The same values were obtained earlier for 

the ordinary chondrites Forest City (H5, S2), Landreth Draw (H5, S2), Richardton (H5, S1), Sena (H4, S1) by Scott et al. (2014).

Raman spectroscopy confirms the results from EMPA. From the 71 analyzed spots, most correspond, as expected, to olivine 

(peaks at ~822 and 853 cm-1). Pyroxene (peaks at ~333, 393, 654, 674, and 1002  cm-1), plagioclase (peaks at ~473 and 503 cm-

1), troilite (peaks at ~213, 279 and 391 cm-1) and chromite (peak at ~690 cm-1) are also detected as relatively common phases. 

From the accessory minerals we focused on merrillite (peaks at ~958 and 973  cm-1). Strong enough shock events would have 

caused the transformation of merrillite in veins into polymorph with structure of trigonal γ-Ca3(PO4)2 (Xie et al. 2002). This 

phase was not detected, indicating that the sample is not strongly shock-metamorphosed, which is consistent with the low 

S2 shock degree defined for Annama. 

The bulk and grain density of both meteorites are 3.5 g/cm3 and 3.8 g/cm3 respectively. Resulting porosity is 8%. Logarithm 

of magnetic susceptibility (measured in 10-9 m3/kg) of both meteorites is 5.4. The density and magnetic susceptibility values 

are also consistent with H chondrite. 

The complete description of the Annama fall, recovery, physical appearance, and classification is available from Meteorite 

Bulletin, 104, 2015 (https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?code=61696). 

Cosmogenic radionuclides 

We report here long-lived cosmogenic radionuclides in Annama I (Table 1) and short-lived radionuclides plus 26Al in Annama 

II (Table 2). Short-, medium-, and long-lived radionuclides detected in Annama II are 26Al, 7Be, 22Na, 56Co, 57Co, 58Co,60Co, 54Mn, 

46Sc. For 44Ti only upper detection limits are reported. The given activities are calculated for the date of fall following the 

simple decay law, and taking into account the time that passed between the fall of the meteo rite and its measurement. 

Cosmogenic, radiogenic, and trapped noble gases, and nitrogen 

The noble gas  (He, Ne, Ar) concentrations and isotopic ratios measured in samples of  Annama Ia and  Ib  (used for the 

determination of the cosmic history) are listed in Table 3. The step-wise heating data for He, Ne, Ar, and Kr from Annama Ir 

are listed in Table S2 in Supporting Information, while the step-wise heating data for Xe are given in Table S3 in Supporting 

Information. In all three Annama I samples, He, Ne and Ar are dominated by cosmogenic and radiogenic components (from 

cosmic  ray  induced spallation reactions, and  radioactive decay, respectively). Helium is released at  lower temperatures 

(mostly ≤900°C)  compared to  Ne,  Ar,  Kr  and  Xe  (mostly >900°C;  Tables S1  and  S2  in  Supporting Information).  The low 

cosmogenic 22Ne/21Ne ratio of 1.058 ±0.003  suggests that Annama acquired most of its cosmogenic noble gases in a body 

which was at least 65 cm in radius, significantly larger than the one delivering the Annama meteorite in 2014, hinting at a 

complex multi-stage cosmic ray exposure age. Combining the cosmogenic 3He, 21Ne and 38Ar concentrations with the shielding 

information from the 22Ne/21Ne, cosmogenic radionuclides and a production rate model (Leya and Masarik 2009, Dalcher et 

al. 2013), we obtain cosmic ray exposure ages of 28, 34, and 27  Ma for He, Ne, and Ar, respectively (samples Annama Ia + Ib). 

The radiogenic 4He and 40Ar can be combined with the typical abundances of K, U, Th in H chondrites (Wasson and Kallemeyn 

1988)  to determine a nominal U, Th-He age of 2.7 Ga  for Annama Ia + Ib, and 2.5 Ga for Annama Ir, compatible within the 

typical uncertainty of this method. The K-Ar age of all three Annama I samples is identical within uncertainties at 3.8 Ga.

No solar-wind-derived He and Ne was found, therefore Annama is not a regolith breccia (about 15% of all H chondrites are 

regolith breccias, Bischoff and Schultz 2004), nor are there other trapped components present for He and Ne. For Ar, a small 

contribution from a trapped (t) component (likely Ar-Q given the Q-like 36Art/132Xet and 84Krt/132Xet ratios, Fig. S2 in Supporting 

Information) is present. Kr and Xe are dominated by the Q component (Busemann et al. 2000),  with a concentration in the 

typical range of an equilibrated ordinary chondrite. Besides Q gases, there is also a contribution of cosmogenic Kr ( Fig. S3 in 

Supporting Information). A small excess of 82Kr by neutron-induced reactions on Br are visible in the 83Kr/84Kr vs 82Kr/84Kr three 

isotope plot (Fig. S4 in Supporting Information). The neutron-induced Kr excess is very small, either due to very little shielding, 

or  very large shielding deep inside a large parent body (>2 m). The second interpretation is in  agreement with the high 

shielding conditions derived from the low 22Ne/21Ne ratio. Some 129Xe from the decay of now-extinct 129I (t1/2 = 15 Ma) is also 

present, with a 129Xe/132Xe ratio of 1.144. 

The nitrogen isotopic composition is reported as δ15N (‰) where: δ15N=[{(15N/14N)sample/(15N/14N)standard}-1]×1000, and the 

standard is atmospheric nitrogen ( 15N/14N = 0.003676).  In Annama Ir, 39.2  ppm nitrogen was released (most of it at the 900°C 

step, see Table S2) and the measured isotopic signature have δ15N = 4.37 ±0.13‰. These values are in the typical range of 

ordinary chondrites (Hashizume and Sugiura 1995, Sugiura et al. 1998).  Cosmogenic 15N is produced in meteorites through 

spallation reactions (Mathew and Murty 1993). The trapped (t) nitrogen after cosmogenic (c) correction, calculated as δ15Nt 

= (δ15Nm-δ15Nc) using cosmogenic 21Nec (Mathew and Murty 1993) has δ15Nt = 0.97 ‰. 

Ar-Ar dating 

The age spectrum of Annama (Fig. 7) shows no definite age plateau, if evaluated with a trapped solar 40Ar/36Ar ratio of 1 ±1 

(i.e. essentially all 40Ar is radiogenic). At higher degassing temperatures we have evidence of recoil-redistribution of 39Ar from 

K-rich lower temperature phases into K-poor higher temperature phases, resulting in lowered apparent ages. This also agrees 

with an elevated age at 560°C  which cannot be readily explained by a different and still unaccounted trapped Ar  component 

and more likely mirrors the preferential loss of 39Ar via recoil from finer-grained K carriers. The respective integrated age of 

Annama is 4399 ±11 (int.) / 12 (ext.) Ma. A closer inspection of the data in a 40Ar/36Ar versus 39Ar/36Ar diagram (Fig. 8) revealed 

a linear relation at 675 – 780°C which can be interpreted as an isochron. The intercept of this isochron is 404 ±45 Ma, and the 

40Ar/39Ar ratio derived by the slope would correspond to an age of 4426  ±13  (int.) / 14 (ext.) Ma which agrees  well with an 

inverse isochron age of 4418  ±11 (int.) / 12  (ext.) Ma and with a plateau age calculation of 4420  ±12  (int.) / 13 (ext.) Ma ( Fig. 

7). Isochron regression was performed with the Isoplot 4.15 program (Ludwig 2008)  with correlated errors (equation 14 in 

Ludwig and Titterington (1994)). Note, that we used the uncertainties given for the observed scatter. 

Major release of Ca-derived 37Ar was detected at higher temperatures (1080 – 1400°C), but no age plateau defining the 38Ar 

cosmic ray exposure age could be identified. Assuming a production ratio of 2.8·10-8 cm³ STP 38Ar /[g Ca Ma] (Leya and Masarik 

(2009)) equivalent to the production rate at the center of a meteoroid with a radius of 65 cm the lowest calculated cosmic 

ray exposure ages are 39.8 ±0.5 Ma at 1220°C and 41.7 ±2.9 Ma at 1300°C. Note, that both extractions encompass 45% of the 

total 37Ar  release. The ages are  slightly above the estimates based on  21Ne or  38Ar production  rates  (34 Ma  and  27 Ma, 

 
 
Cite as: Kohout et al. 2017.  Meteoritics & Planetary Science, 52, 1525-1541.  dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12871 

respectively) derived by noble gas analyses (see subsection "Cosmic ray exposure and thermal history" in Discussion section) 

but must be considered as an upper limit since production of spallogenic  38Ar from Fe and Ni is not included. 

Mössbauer spectroscopy and magnetization measurements 

The Mössbauer spectrum of Annama is shown in  Fig.9. This  spectrum visually consists of several magnetic sextets and 

quadrupole doublets. The best fit of the spectrum revealed the presence of 8 magnetic sextets, 5 quadrupole doublets and 2 

singlets (parameters are given in Table S4 in Supporting Information). 

Magnetic sextets 1–7 are related to different Fe-Ni-Co alloy phases whereas sextet 8 is related to troilite (FeS). Judging from 

their hyperfine parameters sextet 1 can be related to α 2-Fe(Ni, Co) phase while sextets 2–5 may be associated with the same 

α-Fe(Ni, Co) phase but with variations in Ni and Co concentration. Sextets 6 and 7 can be assigned to -Fe(Ni, Co) and -FeNi, 

respectively. Quadrupole doublets 9 and 10 and 11 and 12  are related to the M1  and M2 sites in olivine and orthopyroxene, 

respectively. Additional minor quadrupole doublet 13  is associated with hercynite. Two singlets 14 and  15  are  related to 

paramagnetic -Fe(Ni, Co) and  chromite phases, respectively.  The abovementioned  phases were confirmed by  SEM-EDS 

observations at the Ural Federal University. The values of hyperfine parameters of these spectral components ( Table S4) are 

in agreement with those recently obtained for corresponding phases in H, L  and LL  ordinary chondrites (Maksimova et al. 

2016ac, Oshtrakh et al. 2016, Maksimova et al. 2017). 

The FC and ZFC curves and M(H) curve measured for Annama H5 meteorite fragment are shown in Fig. 10. These curves 

clearly indicate a  multi-phase  bulk material which may  be  composed of  paramagnetic (PM)  and  magnetically ordered 

components. The low temperature magnetization decrease in both curves reflects the PM phases whereas the increase at 

the high temperature range is attributed to  the various magnetic phases. Thus, the low temperature inflections are the 

compensation points of these two components. The 60 K  feature on  the FC/ZFC curve can  be  associated with the Curie 

temperature of chromite (Gattacceca et al. 2011). The nature of the bulges at around 70–80 K and 200  K are not clear. FC/ZFC 

curves did not converge at the temperature range up to 300  K indicating a higher blocking temperature of the remanence 

carrier. 

The isothermal magnetization M(H) curve measured at 5 K first increases linearly up to 2 kOe and then tend to saturate. 

M(H) is also a  mixture of two components and can be fitted as: M(H) =  Ms+pH, where Ms = 38.9  emu/g is the saturation 

magnetization of the intrinsic magnetic phases and pH is the linear PM part. The part of the hysteresis curve at 5 K (Fig. 10) 

shows a remanence Mrs value of 0.48 emu/g and a small coercive field Hc of 16 Oe which are the bulk values of the various 

Fe(Ni, Co) magnetic phases. 

Discussion 

Mineralogy and physical properties 

Mineralogical and physical properties data indicate that Annama is a rather typical H chondrite with moderate shock and 

low weathering degree. The measured bulk (3.5 g/cm3) and grain density (3.8 g/cm3), and porosity (8%), are within the range 

of the bulk (average 3.42 g/cm3 s.d. 0.18  g/cm3) and grain (3.72 g/cm3 s.d. 0.12 g/cm3) density and porosity (7.0% s.d. 4.90%)

of other H chondrite falls reported in Consolmagno et al. (2008). The magnetic susceptibility logarithm of 5.4 is also within 

the H chondrite falls value (average 5.32 s.d. 0.10) reported in Rochette et al. (2003). 

The total relative area (relative part) of the Mössbauer spectral components associated with Fe-Ni-Co alloy is significantly 

(~53 %) larger than this value found in the range ~10–20  % in the Mössbauer spectra of some other H ordinary chondrites by 

Oshtrakh et al. (2008) and Maksimova et al. (2017). The absorption effect of the overlapped magnetic sextets related to Fe-

Ni-Co alloy is smaller than that for troilite magnetic sextet in the abovementioned studies. In the Annama case the absorption 

effect for troilite magnetic sextet is about 3 times smaller than that for the total main overlapped Fe-Ni-Co alloy sextets. This 

fact indicates a larger content of Fe-Ni-Co alloy in the 88 mg Annama II sample used for the Mössbauer studies. The larger Fe-

Ni-Co alloy content in the studied sample may be related to inhomogeneous (locally enriched) content of these phases in 

Annama source material at a ~10  mg scale or it may be a result of another composition of iron-bearing phases. We cannot 

distinguish among these two possible explanations and thus, further investigations are required. 

The comparison of the total metal content derived from metallography (15 – 20 wt%) to the average value of 18.02 wt% 

found in other H chondrites (McSween et al. 1991)  as well as abovementioned magnetic susceptibility value indicates that 

the bulk metal content of Annama is similar to other H chondrites. 

We can  also compare the ratios of Fe2+ parts  in the M1  and M2  sites in both olivine and orthopyroxene using XRD and 

Mössbauer data. The ratios XFe

M1/ XFe

M2 obtained from XRD are 1.2 and 0.1 for olivine and orthopyroxene, respectively, while 

the relative area ratios AM1/AM2 in the Mössbauer spectrum are 1.4 and 0.2  for the same silicates, i.e. results obtained from 

the two methods are in agreement. 

Cosmic ray exposure and thermal history 

Information on the cosmic ray exposure (CRE) age of Annama, its pre-entry size and the depth of the two Annama meteorite 

fragments (I and II) within the meteoroid can be inferred from the cosmogenic radionuclide and noble gas data. The He, Ne, 

Ar content of Annama can be explained by two major components: cosmogenic noble gases from spallation reactions induced 

by cosmic rays, and radiogenic noble gases from the decay of 40K and 238U, 235U and 232Th. No trapped (e.g., solar-wind derived) 

noble gases are present for He and Ne, but a small, trapped argon component is present, as indicated by a  36Ar/38Ar ratio 

higher than the cosmogenic value of 0.65 (Table 3). The radiogenic 4He and 40Ar concentrations provide information on the 

thermal history of the Annama meteorite on its parent body. 

Cosmogenic radionuclides 

The production rates of cosmogenic radionuclides in meteorite samples are mainly a function of the primary GCR  (galactic 

cosmic ray) flux and the shielding conditions of the sample, i.e. the pre -entry size of the meteoroid and depth of the sample 

with the meteoroid. Activities of short-lived radionuclides, with half-lives less than the orbital period, integrate the production 

of these radionuclides over the last segment of the orbit and solar cycle, while activities of long -lived radionuclides (such as 

10Be, 26Al and 36Cl) integrate the production over many orbits and many solar cycles.

The 22Na/26Al activity ratio in stony meteorite falls is a useful indicator for the GCR flux in the last 3 – 5 years before the fall, 

as the 22Na/26Al production ratio is relatively independent of shielding conditions (Evans et al. 1982,  Bhandari et al. 2002), so 

the measured ratio varies as a function of the 22Na production rate over the past 3 – 5 years. The measured 22Na/26Al ratio of 

1.7 ±0.2 in Annama is similar to the average ratio of 1.5 for H chondrite falls (Evans et al. 1982, Bhandari et al. 2002). The fall 

of the Annama H5 ordinary chondrite occurred in the middle of the solar cycle 24 as indicated by the Bartol Research Institute 

neutron  monitor data  (http://neutronm.bartol.udel.edu/, retrieved November 10,  2016).  Since  solar  cycle  24  shows a 

relatively small maximum in solar activity and  was preceded by a  long period of low solar  activity, the slightly elevated 

22Na/26Al ratio indicates that the average GCR flux in 2008 – 2013  was <10% higher than the long-time (million year) average. 

It is therefore safe to assume that radionuclides with shorter half-lives than 22Na experienced an average GCR flux very similar 

to the long-time average. Since the CRE age of Annama is ~30 Ma, as will be shown below, all radionuclides were saturated 

at  the time of  fall, and  the  measured activities thus represent the production rates, which can  be  compared to  model 

calculations for meteorites of different size. 

To derive the pre-entry size and depth of Annama II, we mainly used the 60Co (5.27 a), 54Mn (312 d), 22Na (2.6 a) and 26Al 

(0.705 Ma) activities. Of these four radionuclides, the production rate of 60Co is the most sensitive to the size and depth of 

the  meteorite, since this  nuclide is produced from  59Co  by  capture  of  low-energy thermal neutrons, which only reach 

significant fluxes in objects large enough to attenuate the secondary neutrons to thermal energies. As the 60Co concentration 

of 7 dpm/kg in Annama II is rather low compared to maximum values of ~200 dpm/kg in objects with radii of 45 – 65 cm, the 

specimen was either from a small meteoroid (<20 cm radius) or close to the surface of meteoroid with radius larger than 

20 cm (Eberhardt et al. 1963,  Spergel et al. 1986).  The measured 22Na activity was compared to the calculations of Bhandari 

et al. (1993) for H chondrites, yielding a radius of 10 – 20 cm if the sample was from the center of the meteoroid, or a bigger 

meteoroid (20 – 100 cm) if it came from the surface. The 54Mn activity was normalized to the concentration of its main target 

Fe (27 wt%) and compared to the calculations of Kohman and Bender (1967) giving a range for the radius of 10  – 20 cm, in 

case it came from the central part, or  20  –  100 cm, in case it came from anywhere in the meteoroid. Finally, the low 56Co 

activity indicates that the sample did not originate from the outer 1 –  2 cm, where elevated 56Co from production by solar 

cosmic rays (SCR) is expected (e.g. Evans et al.1987, Nishiizumi et al. 2014). Comparison of the 26Al activity in Annama II with 

calculations of Leya and Masarik (2009) gives a similar size and depth range. Short-lived radionuclide and 26Al from Annama 

II thus give us two possible scenarios – an origin in the center of a small (10 –  20 cm  radius) meteoroid, or a near-surface 

origin (5 – 15 cm depth) on a larger meteoroid (up to ~1 m radius). 

For Annama I, we only measured the long-lived radionuclides, 10Be, 26Al and 36Cl. The 26Al concentration of 73 ±3 dpm/kg in 

Annama I  is significantly higher than the value of 54  ±5 dpm/kg measured in Annama II. Although these two values were 

determined with different methods (AMS vs. GRS), the two methods generally agree within 10 – 15%  for the same sample, 

so the 35% difference in 26Al between the two samples is real and is most likely due to a significant difference in shielding 

depth of the two Annama fragments within the pre-entry meteoroid. Based on the model of Leya and Masarik (2009), the 

measured 26Al activity in Annama I is within error consistent with calculated production rates in or near the center of objects 

with radii of 40  – 50 cm (Fig. 11a), i.e. slightly larger than the size of 30 – 35 cm estimated from the fireball observations. In 

 
Cite as: Kohout et al. 2017.  Meteoritics & Planetary Science, 52, 1525-1541.  dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12871 

this scenario, Annama II comes from a depth of ~5 cm, which is consistent with the short-lived radionuclide results discussed 

above. 

Most of the 36Cl in stone meteorites is produced from spallation reactions on Ca and Fe, with mi nor contributions from K, 

Ti, Cr, Mn and Ni (Leya and Masarik 2009). However, in objects large enough (R >20 cm) to attenuate the secondary neutrons 

to thermal energies, 36Cl is also produced from neutron capture on 35Cl. The 36Cl concentration of 9.8 dpm/kg in the stone 

fraction of Annama I is ~30% higher than the maximum 36Cl production rate of ~7.5 dpm/kg for spallation reactions alone (Fig. 

11b). The elevated 36Cl indicates a significant contribution (2.5 ±0.5 dpm/kg) of neutron-capture-produced 36Cl. Assuming an 

average Cl concentration of 80 ppm for H chondrites, this yields a 36Cl production rate of ~30 atoms/min/g Cl. This neutron-

capture 36Cl component corresponds to a 60Co activity of ~50 dpm/kg (Spergel et al., 1986), i.e. much higher than the neutron-

capture 60Co activity of  7 dpm/kg in Annama II. This is consistent with the pre-entry radius of >30 cm  and  confirms that 

Annama I came from a deeper position than Annama II. 

The 10Be concentration of 18.9 dpm/kg is ~10% lower than expected for irradiation in the center of an object with radius of 

40  –  50 cm (Fig. 11c), a  shielding condition that was inferred from the high 26Al concentration in Annama II. However, the 

measured  10Be  concentration  is  consistent  with  irradiation  closer  to  the  surface  of  a  larger  object  (R~65 cm).  The 

disagreement between shielding conditions derived from the 26Al and 10Be data is also evident from the measured 26Al/10Be 

ratio of ~4.0, which is higher than the production ratio of 3.0 – 3.5 for medium to large objects. This elevated 26Al/10Be ratio 

could indicate that Annama experienced a recent break-up event 3 – 5 Ma  ago, which led to higher production rates in the 

last stage and left 10Be slightly below saturation for the new shielding conditions. This event may be responsible for reducing 

the pre-entry size of Annama to  30  –  35 cm  radius inferred from atmospheric entry modeling. Such a  complex exposure 

scenario seems consistent with the noble gas  data in Annama, which –  as  will be discussed below – also indicate higher 

shielding conditions for most of its exposure history than those inferred from fireball observations. To constrain the details 

of this complex exposure history would require more detailed analyses, which are beyond the scope of this initial study of 

Annama. 

Cosmogenic noble gases 

The cosmogenic 22Ne/21Ne ratio is a characteristic shielding indicator for small to medium sized meteoroids (<65 cm radius), 

where it varies from approximately 1.25 near the surface of very small (chondritic) meteoroids to approximately 1.06 in the 

center of an object with 65  cm radius (Leya and Masarik 2009).  The average measured 22Ne/21Ne ratio in Annama Ia +  Ib 

(1.058 ±0.003) is at the low end of this range. In agreement with the radionuclide findings presented above, this suggests that 

(most of) the cosmogenic Ne in Annama was produced in a meteoroid with a radius of >65 cm and (at H chondrite density) a 

mass of >4000  kg. This is larger than the calculated pre-entry mass of Annama based on the fireball data analysis (Trigo-

Rodríguez et al. 2015,  Lyytinen and Gritsevich 2016),  suggesting that the meteorite had a complex exposure history, i.e. was 

exposed to cosmic radiation under more than one shielding condition. The 3He/21Ne ratio of Annama Ia + Ib is 3.65, which is 

a bit lower than expected for a meteorite with 22Ne/21Ne = 1.058  (based both on the Leya and Masarik (2009) model and the 

“Bern-line”; Eberhardt et al. 1966), suggesting He loss on the order of ~15%. Using the 22Ne/21Ne ratio as a shielding parameter 

 
 
Cite as: Kohout et al. 2017.  Meteoritics & Planetary Science, 52, 1525-1541.  dx.doi.org/10.1111/maps.12871 

as  suggested by Leya and Masarik (2009),  we derive a 21Ne production rate of  4.1  x  10-9 cm3 STP/gMa  and  a  cosmic ray 

exposure age of 32 Ma. If we use the radius and shielding depth suggested by 22Ne/21Ne = 1.058 (R = 65 cm, D = 46 cm) to 

directly derive production rates from the model, the 3He, 21Ne, and 38Ar exposure ages are 28, 34  and 27 Ma, respectively. 

Another method to determine the CRE age is to use the 26Al/21Ne ratio. Since the production mechanism for 26Al and 21Ne is 

very similar, the activity of 26Al can be used to estimate the 21Ne production rate (e.g. Graf et al. 1990).  Adopting a 26Al/21Ne 

production rate ratio of ~0.35  at/at (Leya and Masarik, 2009), the measured 26Al/21Ne ratio yields a CRE age of 32 Ma. The 

uncertainty on these ages is about 15%  and  is dominated by the typical uncertainties of the production rate model. Our 

preferred value is 30  ±4 Ma,  which should however be considered to be a  lower limit given the possibility  of a  complex 

exposure history with a long first-stage exposure under high shielding. Annama clearly does not belong to the main cluster of 

H chondrites with CRE ages of 7 – 8 Ma (Marti and Graf 1992). 

Radiogenic noble gases 

Using a cosmogenic 4He/3He ratio of 5.8 corresponding to the shielding conditions inferred from the cosmogenic 22Ne/21Ne 

ratio (Leya and Masarik 2009),  we derive the non-cosmogenic 4He concentrations of Annama. If is  the remaining 4He is 

interpreted  as entirely radiogenic,  from the  decay  of  long-lived radionuclides 235U,  238U  and  232Th present at  chondritic 

abundances (13 ppb U and 43 ppb Th, Wasson and Kallemeyn 1988), the resulting nominal U,Th-He age is 2.7 Ga for Annama 

Ia + Ib (2.5 Ga for Annama Ir). When allowing for a 15% He loss as suggested by cosmogenic He, this value increases to 3.0 Ga. 

Similarly, a nominal K-Ar age can be determined from the measured 40Ar (which should be almost completely radiogenic) and 

a chondritic K abundance (780 ppm, Wasson and Kallemeyn 1988). This yields a retention age of 3.8 Ga (for all three fragments 

of Annama I analyzed) and suggests that Annama has never been heated to the point of Ar loss since the time of the Late 

Heavy  Bombardment (see however Ar-Ar dating  in  next  section suggesting a  higher Ar-Ar  age  for  Annama). Assuming 

conservatively that 36Artrapped is entirely of atmospheric origin with an atmospheric 40Ar/36Ar ratio of 296, we find that at most 

7% of the measured 40Ar could be atmospheric. 

The concentrations of U, Th and K, derived from the measured activities of the natural radionuclides 232Th and 238U as well 

as for 40K in the meteorite specimens are listed in  

Table 4. Their values are well in accordance with the average concentrations given i n Wasson and Kallemeyn (1988) for H 

chondrites. 

Ar-Ar dating 

The Ar-Ar plateau age of Annama of 4420  ±13  Ma at 675  – 780°C  is about 80 Ma younger than observed for H5 chondrites 

with a reported shock stage S1 (~4500  Ma, Trieloff et al. 2003)  which may indicate an impact-induced resetting of the K-Ar 

system. This might be supported by the degassing pattern of  39Ar which dominantly was released at lower temperatures 

(about 92% of the total 39Ar was released up to 780°). This would be expected if a slight shock cracks the respective K carrier 

grains and thus  changes the grain size distribution towards smaller effective diffusional lengths. However, the degassing 

characteristics alone is not a criteria for shock effects. We observe one major release peak of 39Ar, in opposite to some other

hardly shocked H5 chondrites which display a second major degassing peak at elevated temperatures >1000°C ( Trieloff et al. 

2003). Annama is classified with a shock stage S2, but it contains thin veins of impact melt which may point to a more severe 

thermal event potentially related to our younger age. It is thus possible that the low temperature plateau age of 4420 ±13 

Ma  represents the time of this thermal event. From our Ar-Ar analyses we only obtained a maximum cosmic ray exposure 

age of about 40 Ma calculated from Ca-derived spallogenic 38Ar, which is however, in reasonable agreement with our noble 

gas data. 

Conclusions 

Based on mineralogy and physical properties, Annama is a typical H  chondrite. It also has a  high Ar-Ar age of 4.4 Ga. Its 

cosmic ray exposure history is, however, atypical. Annama is not part of the large group of H chondrites with a prominent 7 

– 8 Ma  peak in the exposure age histograms. Instead, its exposure age is within uncertainty of a smaller peak at 30 ±4 Ma. 

The combination of noble gases and radionuclides also seem to indicate a complex exposure history. The results from short-

lived radionuclides are compatible with an atmospheric pre-entry radius of 30 – 40  cm. However, based on noble gas and 

cosmogenic radionuclide data, Annama must have been part of a larger body (radius >65 cm) for a large part of its cosmic ray 

exposure history. The 10Be concentration indicates a recent (3 – 5 Ma) breakup which may be responsible for the Annama 

parent body size reduction to 30 – 35 cm pre-entry radius.

Fig. 7. Argon age spectrum of Annama. Black spectrum represents apparent ages corrected with a trapped solar 40Ar/36Ar 

composition of 1 ±1. A correction with a trapped 40Ar/36Ar ratio of 404  ±45 resulted in a plateau age of 4420  ±13 Ma (grey 

color) which is more appropriate for isochron extractions of 675 – 780°C. Uncertainties are 1 s.d.

rates (from Leya and Masarik 2009) for H chondrites with radii of 10 – 100  cm. For 26Al both the GRS (Gamma-ray 

spectroscopy) result for Annama II and AMS (Accelerator mass spectrometry) result for Ann ama I are shown. Note that the 

measured 36Cl concentration in Annama I is ~30% higher than calculated 36Cl production rates by spallation reactions alone, 

indicating a significant contribution of neutron-capture 36Cl.
