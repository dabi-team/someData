Abstract

We carry out an investigation of the existence of inﬁnitely many solutions to a
fractional p-Kirchhoﬀ type problem with a singularity and a superlinear nonlin-
earity with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Further the solution(s)
will be proved to be bounded and a weak comparison principle has also been
proved. A ‘C 1 versus W s,p

’ analysis has also been discussed.

Introduction

Oﬀ late, the problems involving a nonlocal and fractional operators have become hugely
popular area of investigation owing to its manifold applications, viz. stratiﬁed mate-
rials, population dynamics, continuum mechanics, water waves, minimal surface prob-
lems etc. Interested readers may refer to [3, 6, 11, 16, 18, 30, 43] and the references
therein.
The problem addressed in this article is as follows.

where λ, µ > 0, g, h ≥ 0 are functions that are deﬁned and bounded over Ω. Here
Ω ⊂ RN is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary ∂Ω for N ≥ 2, a > 0, b ≥ 0,

0 < γ, s < 1 < p < ∞, sp < N. The function f is a Carath´eodory function and the
operator Ls

p is deﬁned as

Ls

pu = 2 lim
ǫ→0+

RN \Bǫ(x)

Z

|u(x) − u(y)|p−2(u(x) − u(y))K(x − y)dy

for all x ∈ RN where Bǫ(x) = {y : |y − x| < ǫ}. The function K : RN \ {0} → (0, ∞)
is measurable with the following properties:

(i) ρK ∈ L1(RN ) where ρ(x) = min{|x|2, 1}
(ii) There exists δ > 0 such that K(x) ≥ δ|x|−N −ps for all x ∈ RN
(iii) K(x) = K(−x) for all x ∈ RN \ {0}.

(1.2)

One can retrieve the fractional p-Laplace operator if the ‘kernel’ K is chosen to be
K(x) = |x − y|−N −ps. The discussion in Section 4.1 uses following condition (P ).

(P ′) : δ1|x|−N −ps ≥ K(x) ≥ δ2|x|−N −ps

for all x ∈ RN where δ1, δ2 > 0. In general, it is a practice to denote the Kirchhoﬀ
function as M. In the current case M(t) = a + btp where a, b ≥ 0 with a + b > 0. Such
a Kirchhoﬀ function is termed as the nondegenerate ones. Therefore when M(t) ≡ 1,
λ = 0, p = 2, g(x) = 1, h(x) = 1 a.e. in Ω, we reduce to the problem in (1.1) to

(−∆)su = µu−γ + f (x, u), in Ω

u > 0, in Ω
u = 0, in RN \ Ω.

(1.3)

For further details on the problem in (1.3) one may refer to [43]. The problem in
(1.3) with µ = 0 has been addressed in [42]. The authors have used a variational
technique to guarantee the existence of multiple solutions. Further results on existence
of multiple solutions can be found in [5, 46].
In most of these studies, the authors
obtained two distinct weak solutions. Readers may refer to [2, 27, 28, 35, 47, 53] for
ideas and techniques developed in order to guarantee the existence of inﬁnitely many
solutions to nonlocal elliptic problems driven by a singularity.
Meanwhile, we direct the readers to a variety of forms for the function M [12, 13, 17,
22, 24, 48, 49, 50, 54]. With the advent of these references and with the help of fountain
theorem, the authors in [23] have proved the existence of inﬁnitely many solutions for
a fractional p-Kirchhoﬀ problem. A use of the fountain theorem has also been made
in [52] to guarantee the existence of inﬁntely many solutions for a fractional Kirchhoﬀ
type problem. In [37], the authors showed the existence and multiplicity of solutions to
a degenerate fractional p-Kirchhoﬀ problem. Fiscella et al in [4] dealt with Kirchhoﬀ
type equation over RN involving Hardy-Sobolev nonlinearities with critical exponent.

3

We also refer to [25, 33, 40] for a related problem. Recently, Ghosh [45] has proved the
existence of inﬁnitely many solutions to a system of fractional Laplacian Kirchhoﬀ type
problem with a sublinear growth. For articles that addressed the problem of p-Kirchhoﬀ
system, one may refer to [39] and the references therein. A futuristic research in this
direction is to consider the parabolic counterparts to these problems. The readers may
refer to the work due to [36] and the references therein. Motivated from the work
due to Ren et al [55] we will show the existence of inﬁnitely many solutions to a p-
Kirchhoﬀ type problem with a superlinear growth without the AR condition. It will
also be proved that the solution (if exists) is in L∞(Ω). A weak comparison principle
has also been proved. A little bit of history about the AR condition - this condition
was ﬁrst introduced by Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz (refer [1]) in 1973. Thereafter
this condition formed a formidable tool in the analysis of elliptic PDEs, especially to
prove the boundedness of the Palais-Smale (PS) sequences for the associated energy
functional to the problem. To our knowledge there is no evidence in the literature that
considered a nonlocal p-Kirchhoﬀ type problem with a singular nonlinearity without
the AR condition. Therefore the problem considered and the results obtained here are
new.

2. A simple physical motivation

This section is devoted to a physical motivation to the problem considered in this
article. The explanation is physically heuristic but nevertheless gives a strong math-
ematical motivation to take up this problem. We will restrict to the one dimensional
case of the model of an elastic string of ﬁnite length ﬁxed at both the ends. The ver-
tical displacement of the string will be represented by u : [−1, 1] × [0, ∞) → R. Then,
mathematically, the end point constraints can be expressed as

u(0, t) = u(2, t) = 0

for all t ≥ 0.
consider

In order to identify this ﬁnite string with an inﬁnite string one can

u(x, t) = 0

for all x ∈ R \ [0, 2], t ≥ 0. Thus, the acceleration ∂2u
∂t2 of the vertical displacement u of
the vibrating string must be balanced (thanks to Newton’s laws) by the elastic force
of the string and by the external force ﬁeld f . Therefore we have
∂2u
∂x2 + f, for all x in [0, 2], t ≥ 0.

∂2u
∂t2 = m

When the steady case is considered, we have

m

∂2u(x)
∂x2 = f (x), in [0, 2].

4

We quote here G.F. Carrier [15] - it is well known that the classical linearized analysis
of the vibrating string can lead to results which are reasonably accurate only when the
minimum (rest position) tension and the displacements are of such magnitude that the
relative change in tension during the motion is small. Taking this into account one can
suppose that the tension due to small deformation is linear in form, then we have the
following expression.

M(l) = m0 + 2Cl

where l is the increment in the length of the string with respect to its mean position,
i.e.

l =

In other words it models the vibration of a string.

3. Technical preliminaries and functional analytic

set up

We begin by giving the conditions of the function f which is assumed to have a super-
linear growth. We quickly will recall the AR condition, which is as follows.

(AR) : there exist constants r > 0, 1 < η < θ such that

0 < θF (x, t) ≤ tf (x, t) for any x ∈ Ω, t ∈ R and |t| ≥ r.

(3.1)

t

0 f (x, t)dt. From (3.1) we have that F (x, t) ≥ c1|t|θ − c2, for any
Here F (x, t) =
(x, t) ∈ Ω × R, where θ > η for c1, c2 > 0 constants. However, there are still many
R

 
5

functions which are superlinear at inﬁnity yet not satisfying the AR condition. We
make note of another form which is given by

lim
|t|→∞

F (x, t)
|t|η = ∞ uniformly for x ∈ Ω.

(3.2)

A closer observation shows that the nonlinearity f , under the condition (3.2), is also
superlinear at inﬁnity. Clearly, for example, the function f (x, t) = tη−1 log(1 + t)
satisﬁes (3.2) but does not satisfy (3.1). Some important works that has proved the
existence of inﬁnitely many solutions for nonlocal equations of fractional Laplacian
type driven by a superlinear term and with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary data, but
without the AR condition can be found in [38]. We now give the assumptions made
on the function f : Ω × R → R.

(f1) ∃C > 0 and q ∈ (p, p∗

and increasing if t ≥ t > 0∀x ∈ Ω

(f6) ∃σ ≥ 1 and T ∈ L1(Ω) satisfying T (x) ≥ 0 such that G(x, s) ≤ σG(x, t) + T (x)

∀x ∈ Ω and 0 ≤ |s| ≤ |t|, where G(x, t) =

1
2p

tf (x, t) − F (x, t).

Remark 3.1. The condition (f6) was assumed by Jeanjean [31]. When σ = 1 one can
see that the conditions (f5) and (f6) are equivalent. In general, there are functions (for
example f (x, t) = 2p|t|2p−2t ln(1 + t2p) + p sin t) that satisfy (f6) but not (f5).
We assign Q = R2N \ C(Ω) × C(Ω) where C(Ω) = RN \ Ω. The space X will denote
the space of Lebesgue measurable functions from RN to R such that its restriction to
Ω of any function u in X belongs to Lp(Ω) and

|u(x) − u(y)|pK(x − y)dxdy < ∞.

The space X is equipped with the norm

We deﬁne the subspace X0 of X as

X0 = {u ∈ X : u = 0 a.e. in RN \ Ω}

equipped with the norm

kuk =

|u(x) − u(y)|pK(x − y)dxdy

(cid:19)

The space X0 is a Banach and a reﬂexive space (refer Lemma 2.4 of [50] and Theorem
1.2 of [41]). We will denote the usual fractional Sobolev space by W s,p
0 (Ω) equipped
with norm

kukW s,p(Ω) = kukLp(Ω) +

|u(x) − u(y)|pK(x − y)dxdy

(cid:18)ZΩ×Ω

.

(cid:19)

Note that the norms k · kX and k · kW s,p are not equivalent when K(x) = |x|−N −ps as
Ω × Ω is strictly contained in Q. This makes the space X0 diﬀerent from the usual
fractional Sobolev space. Thus the fractional Sobolev space is insuﬃcient for dealing
with our problem from the variational method point of view. For a general kernel
K satisfying (1.2) we have X0 ⊂ {u ∈ W s,p(RN ) : u(x) = 0 a.e. in RN \ Ω}. For
0 (RN ).
|x|N+sp , we have X0 = {u ∈ W s,p(RN ) : u(x) = 0 a.e. in RN \ Ω} = W s,p
K(x) = 1
We now deﬁne the deﬁnition of a solution to (1.1) in a weaker sense.

Deﬁnition 3.2. A function u ∈ X0 is a weak solution to (1.1) if h|u|−γφ ∈ L1(Ω) and

(a + bkukp)

Remark 3.3. We will sometimes denote

hu, vi =

ZQ

Remark 3.4. Henceforth, we will mean a weak solution whenever we use the term
solution.

Remark 3.5. Throughout the article any constant will be denoted by alphabets C with
a preﬁx/suﬃx.

With these developements, we are now in a position to state our main result(s).

Theorem 3.6. Let K : RN \ {0} → (0, ∞) be a function as above in (1.2); (i) − (iii),
and let conditions (f1) − (f5) hold. Then, for any λ > 0 and for small enough µ0 > 0
such that for any µ ∈ (0, µ0), the problem in (1.1) has inﬁnitely many solutions in X0
with unbounded energy.

Theorem 3.7. Let K : RN \ {0} → (0, ∞) be a function as above in (1.2); (i) − (iii)
and let conditions (f1) − (f4) hold. If condition (f6) is considered instead of (f5) then
also the conclusion of the Theorem 3.6 holds.

The next theorem stated is a C 1 versus W s,p
is considered. The functional will still be denoted by I.
Theorem 3.8. Let Ω ⊂ RN be a bounded domain with a C 1,1-boundary and let u0 ∈
C 1( ¯Ω) which satisﬁes

u0 ≥ Cd(x, ∂Ω)s for some C > 0

be a local minimizer of I (deﬁned later in this section) in C 1( ¯Ω) topology; that is, there
exists ǫ > 0 such that, u ∈ C 1( ¯Ω), ku − u0kC1( ¯Ω) < ǫ implies I(u0) ≤ I(u). Then, u0 is
a local minimum of I in W s,p

0 (Ω) as well.

We quickly recall the following eigenvalue problem [55].

Ls
pu = λ|u|p−2u in Ω
u = 0 in RN \ Ω.

(3.4)

This has a divergent sequence of positive eigenvalues

0 < λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ · · · ≤ λn ≤ · · ·

which has eigenvectors say (en)n∈N. Refer to Proposition 9 of [44] where it has been
shown that this sequence (en)n∈N can be so chosen that it provides an orthonormal
basis in Lp(Ω) and an orthogonal basis in X0.
We ﬁrst deﬁne I : X0 → R as

I(u) = A(u) − B(u) − C(u)

(3.5)

From here onwards we will denote k·kLp(Ω) as k·kp. To our dissatisfaction, the functional
I is not a C 1 functional. However we redeﬁne this functional I as follows. We deﬁne

¯f (x, t) =

µh(x)|t|−γ−1t + ˜f (x, t),
µh(x)u−γ

µ + ˜f (x, uµ),

(

The way the functional has been deﬁned, it is easy to see that the critical points of the
functional in (3.8) are also the critical points of the functional (3.5). Most importantly,
the functional ¯I which is deﬁned in (3.8) is C 1 which allows us to use the variational
methods. Further

Remark 3.9. It can easily seen that if u is a weak solution to (3.7) with u > uλ, then
u is also a weak solution to (1.1).

The following lemma will be used in this work.

Lemma 3.10. (Refer Lemma 2.4 [50]) Let the kernel K be as above in (1.2). We then
have the following.

1. For any r ∈ [1, p∗

s), the embedding X0 ֒→ Lr(Ω) is compact when Ω is bounded

with smooth enough boundary.

2. For all r ∈ [1, p∗

s], the embedding X0 ֒→ Lr(Ω) is continuous.

9

Following is the deﬁnition of Cerami condition (Deﬁnition 2.1 [10]).

Deﬁnition 3.11. [Cerami condition] Let B be an inﬁnite dimensional Banach space
with respet to k·kB and I be a C 1(B, R) functional. I is said to satisfy the (Ce)c at level
c ∈ R, if any sequence (un) ⊂ B for which I(un) → c in B, (1 + kunkB)I ′(un) → 0 in
B′, the dual space of B, as n → ∞, then there exists a strongly convergent subsequence
of (unk) of (un) in B.

Remark 3.12. Henceforth, a subsequence of any sequence, say (vn), will also be denoted
by (vn).
We now give the symmetric mountain pass theorem [14].

Theorem 3.13. (Symmetric mountain pass theorem) Let B be as in Deﬁnition 3.11
and Y be a ﬁnite dimensional Banach space such B = Y
Z. For any c > 0 if
I ∈ C 1(B, R) satisﬁes (Ce)c and

L

1. I is even and I(0) = 0 for all u ∈ B

2. There exists r > 0 such that I(u) ≥ R for all u ∈ Br(0) = {u ∈ B : kukB ≤ r}

3. For any ﬁnite dimensional subspace ¯B ⊂ B, there exists r0 = r( ¯B) > 0 such that

I(u) ≤ 0 on ¯B \ Br0(0 ¯B), where 0 ¯B is the null vector in ¯B

then there exists an unbounded sequence of critical values of I characterized by a min-
imax argument.

4. Auxiliary and main result

We begin this section by proving a few auxiliary lemmas.

Lemma 4.1. Let (f1) hold. Then any bounded sequence (un) in X0 which satisﬁes
(1 + kunk) ¯I ′(un) → 0 as n → ∞ possesses a strongly convergent subsequence in X0.

Proof. Let (un) be a bounded sequence in X0 with |un| > uµ. Since X0 is reﬂexive we
have

un ⇀ u in X0,
un → u in Lr(Ω), 1 ≤ r < p∗
s,
un → u a.e. in Ω.

(4.1)

All we need to prove is that un → u strongly in X0. By the H¨older’s inequality and
(f1) we have

0 ≤

|f (x, un)|(un − u)dx ≤

C(1 + |un|q−1)(un − u)dx

ZΩ

ZΩ
≤ C(|Ω|

q−1

(4.2)

10

|f (x, un)|(un − u)dx = 0.

By (4.1) we obtain

lim
n→∞

ZΩ

Further we have from the H¨older’s inequality that

|un|p−2un(un − u)dx ≤ kunkp−1

p kun − ukp.

ZΩ

Therefore again from (4.1) we have

|un|p−2un(un − u)dx = 0.

lim
n→∞

ZΩ

We observe that u cannot be zero over a subset of Ω of non-zero measure. For if it is
so, then h ¯I ′(un), φi → −∞ for a suitable φ ∈ X0. But then we have from the given
condition that (1 + kunk) ¯I ′(un) = o(1) as n → ∞ and this gives rise to an absurdity
of 0 = −∞.
Note that since |un| > uµ, we have

lim
n→∞

||un|−γ−1un(un − u)| = lim
n→∞

||un|1−γ − u|un|−γ−1un| = 0

(4.3)

and hence

ZΩ
We now deﬁne a linear functional

lim
n→∞

|un|−γ−1un(un − u)dx = 0.

Jv(u) =

RN

Z

|v(x) − v(y)|p−2(v(x) − v(y))(u(x) − u(y))K(x − y)dxdy.

The H¨older inequality yields

|Jv(u)| ≤ kvkp−1kuk

for every u ∈ X0 thereby implying that J is a continuous linear functional on X0.
Therefore

lim
n→∞

Jv(un − u) = 0.

From the discussion so far in the proof of this theorem and since un ⇀ u in X0, we
conclude that h ¯I ′(un), un − ui → 0 as n → ∞. Also (1 + kunkX0) ¯I ′(un) → 0 in X ′
0, the
dual space of X0. Therefore, we have

o(1) =h ¯I ′(un), un − ui − λ

g(x)|un|p−2un(un − u)dx

ZΩ
h(x)|un|−γ−1un(un − u)dx −

− µ

f (x, un)(un − u)dx

(4.4)

=(a + bkunkp)Jun(un − u) + o(1) as n → ∞.

ZΩ

ZΩ

Hence, by the boundedness of (un) in X0 and lim
n→∞

Jv(un − u) = 0 we have

lim
n→∞

(Jun(un − u) − Ju(un − u)) = 0.

Recall the Simon inequalities which is as follows.

Thus un → u strongly in X0 as n → ∞.

Lemma 4.2. Let (f1), (f3), (f5) hold. Then the functional ¯I satisﬁes the (Ce)c condi-
tion.

Proof. Let (f5) hold. From the monotonicity of t 7→ f (x,t)

t2p−1 there exists C1 > 0 such that

G(x, s) ≤ G(x, t) + C,

(4.9)

for all x ∈ Ω and 0 ≤ |s| ≤ |t|. Refer (f6) for the deﬁnition of G(., .). Let (un) be a

(1 + kunk) ¯I ′(un) → 0 in X ′

as n → ∞. All we need to show is that the sequence (un) is bounded in X0 and the
conclusion will follow from the Lemma 4.1.
Suppose not, i.e. there exists a subsequence such that kunkX0 → ∞. By the second
condition of (4.10) we have

¯I ′(un) → 0

as n → ∞. Hence

ξn → ξ in Lp(Ω)
ξn → ξ in Lq(Ω)
ξn → ξ a.e. in Ω.

(4.11)

Further, from Lemma A.1 of [51] there exists a function α(x) such that

|ξn(x)| ≤ α(x) in RN .

This leads to the consideration of two cases, viz. ξ = 0 and ξ 6= 0. Since ¯I is a C 1
functional, therefore ¯I(αnun) = max
α∈[0,1]
1

¯I(αun) makes sense.

where |Ω| is the Lebesgue measure of Ω. This is a contradiction to (4.17). Thus (un)
is bounded in X0.
Let ξ 6= 0. Deﬁne

A = {x ∈ Ω : ξ(x) 6= 0}.

Therefore we have

where the last step is due to (4.23), (4.26), (4.27). This is again an absurdity. Thus
the sequence (un) is bounded in X0 and hence by the Lemma 4.1 we conclude that
(un) possesses a strongly convergent subsequence in X0.

We now prove the results stated in the Theorems 3.6 and 3.7. For this let us develope
some prerequisites. It is well known that the space X0 is a Banach space and we have

Theorem 4.3. Let κ ∈ [1, p∗

s). We have

ζm(κ) = sup{kukκ : u ∈ Zm, kuk = 1} → 0

as m → ∞.

Proof. From the deﬁnition of (Zm) we have that Zm+1 ⊂ Zm and thus 0 ≤ ζm+1 ≤ ζm.
This implies that ζm → ζ ≥ 0 as m → ∞. Further by the deﬁnition of supremum for
every m there exists um ∈ Zm such that kumk = 1 and kumkκ > ζm
2 . By the reﬂexivity
of X0 and kumk = 1 we have that um ⇀ 0 in X0. By the embedding results from
Lemma 3.10 we have that um → 0 as m → ∞ in Lκ(Ω) for any κ ∈ [1, p∗
s). Thus we
conclude that ζ = 0.

Proof of Theorem 3.6: Since Ym is a ﬁnite dimensional space, hence the norms k · k
and k · kκ are equivalent for κ ∈ [1, p∗
s). Mathematically this means that there exists
C1, C2 > 0 such that

C1kukX0 ≤ kukκ ≤ C2kukX0, for any κ ∈ [1, p∗

s).

by the Theorem 3.13, there exists an unbounded sequence of critical values of ¯I char-
acterized by a minimax argument. In other words, from the Remark 3.9 the problem
in (3.7) has inﬁnitely many solutions and hence the problem (1.1) also has inﬁnitely
many solutions.

We will now show that the solution u to (1.1) is in L∞(Ω), i.e. bounded in Ω for
K(x) = |x|−N −sp. Firstly, we will prove the following elementary inequality needed for
the proof of the L∞ estimate.

We now prove that a solution to (1.1) is bounded in Ω.

Theorem 4.5. Let f : Ω × R → R be as deﬁned in (f1), then for any weak solution
u ∈ X0, we have u ∈ L∞(Ω).

1
p

Proof. Let 1 ≤ q < p∗

s and let u be any weak solution to the given problem in (1.1)

. For every ρ ≥ p(p − 1), k > 0, the mapping t 7→ t|t|r−p

and let ˜α =

Lipschitz in R. Therefore, u|u|ρ−p
k ∈ X0. In general for any t in R and k > 0, we have
(cid:17)
deﬁned tk = sgn(t) min{|t|, k}. Note that, for a ﬁxed solution of (1.1), say u, we have
that 1/ (a + bkukp) is ﬁnite. We apply the embedding results due to Theorem 3.10,
the previous lemma 4.4, test with the test function u|u|ρ−p

(4.39)

The idea is to try and develop an argument to guarantee that u ∈ Lp1(Ω) for all p1 ≥ 1.
(cid:9)
Therefore deﬁne a recursive sequence (ρn) by setting ρ0 = p∗
s +p−q, ρn+1 = ˜αpρn +q−p.
By the choice of ρ0, we have u ∈ Lρ+q−p(Ω). Therefore, the choice ρ = ρ0 in (4.39)
yields a ﬁnite right hand side and so u ∈ L ˜αpρ(Ω) = Lρ1+q−p(Ω).
Repeating this argument and using the fact ρ 7→ ρ1/ρ is bounded in [2, ∞) for all n, we
have u ∈ L ˜αpρn(Ω). We further have

Arguments from Iannizzotto [7], guarantees

kuk ˜αpρn ≤ G(n, kukp∗

s).

kukp1 ≤ G(p1, kukp∗

s), p1 ≥ 1.

(4.40)

(4.41)

We now improve the estimate in (4.41) by making the function G independent of p1.
Set ˜α′ = ˜α

˜α−1 . Thus by (4.41) and H¨older’s inequality we have

k|u| + |u|p + |u|qk ˜α′ ≤ G(kukp∗

here has been obtained from the function G which was shown previously. Therefore,
we have kuk∞ < ∞.

4.1 C 1 versus W s,p local minimizers of the energy

This section is devoted towards discussing ‘C 1 versus W s,p’ analysis of a solution to
(1.1) for a particular class of Kernel K(x) = |x|−N −sp. Some motivation has been
drawn from the works of [20, 26, 29]. Let us begin with some well-known results and
prove a few lemmas towards which a geometrical property of a general bounded domain
Ω with C 1,1 boundary is stated and is as follows.

Lemma 4.7 (Lemma 3.5, Iannizzotto [8]). Let Ω ⊂ RN be a bounded domain with
a C 1,1 boundary ∂Ω. Then, there exist ρ > 0 such that for all x0 ∈ ∂Ω there exist
x1, x2 ∈ RN on the normal line to ∂Ω at x0, with the following properties

(i) Br(x1) ⊂ Ω, Br(x2) ⊂ Ωc;

(ii) ¯Br(x1) ∩ ¯Br(x2) = {x0};

(iii) d(x) = |x − x0| for all x ∈ [x0, x1].

Using the Lemma 4.7, we generalize two of the results from Iannizzotto [8]. Before
that, we set ∀ R > 0, x0 ∈ RN

Q(u; x0, R) = kukL∞(BR(x0)) + Tail(u; x0, R)

Q(u, R) = Q(u; 0, R)

d(x, ∂Ω) = inf
y∈Ω

{d(x, y)}.

(4.50)

We now state the following Lemmas from [29] which is applicable to the present work
as well. The proofs follow verbatim of lemma 5.4, 5.6, 5.8 of [29].

Lemma 4.8. For any r > 0, there exists C ′′ > 0 such that |(a + bkukp)Ls
Br(x), where u is a weak solution to the problem (1.1).

pu| ≤ C ′′ in

24

Lemma 4.9. There exists 0 < δ ≤ s such that any weak solution u to the problem
(1.1) we have [u/ds]Cδ(Ω) ≤ K.

Remark 4.10. From [9] we can say that u ∈ C 1( ¯Ω).

Lemma 4.11. There exists 0 < δ ≤ s such that for any weak solution u of the problem
(1.1) we have [Du]Cδ(Ω) ≤ C.

We will now prove the Theorem 3.8. The main tool to prove this result requires an
application of the Lagrange multiplier rule which is given in the form of Theorem 3.1
from [34].

Theorem 4.12. Let L and J be real C 1 functionals on a real Banach space say X. If
z0 ∈ X satisﬁes the following problem:

minimizing L(z) under the constratint J(z) = 0.

Then there exists Λ ∈ R such that L′(z0) = ΛJ ′(z0).

For a more generalized version of the result, one may refer to [21] and the references
therein.
Proof of Theorem 3.8: Let Ω′ ⋐ Ω. We will work with the functional ¯I since, a
critical point of ¯I is also a critical point of I whenever u > uµ. We will only consider
the subcritical case i.e. when q < p∗
s − 1. We prove by contradiction, i.e. suppose u0 is
not a local minimizer. Let r ∈ (q, p∗
s − 1) and deﬁne

J(w) =

r + 1

ZΩ′

|w − u0|r+1dx, (w ∈ W s,p(Ω′)).

(4.51)

0 (Ω) : 0 ≤ J(v) ≤ ǫ}. Consider the problem Iǫ = min
v∈Sǫ

Case i: Let J(vǫ) < ǫ.
{ ¯I(v)}. The
Deﬁne Sǫ = {v ∈ W s,p
inﬁmum exists since the set Sǫ is bounded and the functional ¯I is C 1. Furthermore,
¯I is also weakly lower semicontinuous and Sǫ is closed, convex. Thus Iǫ is actually
attained, at say vǫ ∈ Sǫ, and Iǫ = ¯I(vǫ) < ¯I(u0).
Claim: We now show that ∃η > 0 such that vǫ ≥ ηφ1, where φ1 is the eigenvector
corresponding to the ﬁrst eigenvalue, say ˜λ1, of the operator (a + bk · kp)Ls
Proof: We begin by observing that the existence of φ1 can be proved to exist from the
Lemma 5.2. Deﬁne vη = (ηφ1 − vǫ)+. We prove the claim by contradiction, i.e. ∀η > 0
let |Ωη| = |supp{(ηφ1 − vǫ)+}| > 0. For 0 < t < 1, deﬁne ξ(t) = ¯I(vǫ + tvη). Thus

p(·).

ξ′(t) = h ¯I ′(vǫ + tvη), vηi

= h(a + bkukp)Ls

p(vǫ + tvη) − λg(x)(vǫ + tvη)p−1 − µh(x)(vǫ + tvη)−γ − f (x, vǫ + tvη), vηi.

(4.52)

Similarly,

ξ′(1) =h ¯I ′(vǫ + vη), vηi
=h ¯I ′(ηφ1), vηi
=h(a + bkηφ1kp)Ls

p(ηφ1) − λg(x)(ηφ1)p−1 − µh(x)(ηφ1)−γ

− f (x, ηφ1), vηi < 0

for suﬃciently small η > 0. Moreover,

−ξ′(1) + ξ′(t) =h(a + bkukp)Ls

p(vǫ + tvη) − (a + bkukp)Ls

p(vǫ + vη)

+ λg(x)((vǫ + vη)p−1 − (vǫ + tvη)p−1)
+ µh(x)((vǫ + vη)−γ − (vǫ + tvη)−γ)
+ (f (x, vǫ + vη) − f (vǫ + tvη), vηi ≤ 0

25

(4.53)

(4.54)

since λg(x)tp−1 + µh(x)t−γ + f (., t) is a uniformly nonincreasing function with respect
to, suﬃciently small, t > 0 for x ∈ Ω. From the monotonicity of (a + bk · kp)Ls
p(·) (refer
Theorem 4.6) we have that, for suﬃciently small η > 0, 0 ≤ ξ′(1) − ξ′(t). From the
Taylor series expansion and the fact that J(vǫ) < ǫ, ∃ 0 < θ < 1 such that

0 ≤ ¯I(vǫ + vη) − ¯I(vǫ)
= h ¯I ′(vǫ + θvη), vηi
= ξ′(θ).

(4.55)

Thus for t = θ we get ξ′(θ) ≥ 0 which is a contradiction to ξ′(θ) ≤ ξ′(1) < 0 as obtained
above in (4.53) and (4.54). Thus vǫ ≥ ηφ1 for some η > 0.
In fact, from the Lemmas 4.9 and 4.11 we have sup
ǫ∈(0,1]

{kvǫkC1,δ( ¯Ω)} ≤ C. By the compact

embedding C 1,δ( ¯Ω) ֒→ C 1,κΩ), for any κ < δ, we have vǫ → u0 which contradicts the
assumption made. Hence ¯I attains its minimum at u0.
Case ii: J(vǫ) = ǫ.
Let vη = (ηφ1 − vǫ)+ and ξ(t) = ¯I(vǫ + tvη). Then by arguments as in Case i, we have
that ξ is decreasing. This implies that ¯I(vǫ) > ¯I(vǫ + tvη). Since the functionals ¯I, J
are C 1, hence in this case from the Lagrange multiplier rule (refer Theorem 4.12) there
exists Λǫ ∈ R such that ¯I ′(vǫ) = ΛǫJ ′(vǫ). We will ﬁrst show that Λǫ ≤ 0. Suppose
Λǫ > 0, then ∃ φ ∈ X0 such that

h ¯I ′(vǫ), φi < 0 and hJ ′(vǫ), φi < 0.

Then for small t > 0 we have

¯I(vǫ + tφ) < ¯I(vǫ)
J(vǫ + tφ) < J(vǫ) = ǫ

26

which is a contradiction to vǫ being a minimizer of ¯I in Sǫ.
We now consider the following two cases.
Case a: (Λǫ ∈ (−l, 0) where l > −∞).
Now consider the sequence of problems

(Pǫ) : (a + bkukp)Ls

pu = λg(x)up−1 + µh(x)u−γ + f (x, u) + Λǫ|u − u0|r−1(u − u0)

(4.56)

Observe that u0 is a weak solution to (Pǫ). From the weak comparison principle
(Theorem 4.6) we have vǫ ≥ ηφ1 for some η > 0 small enough, independent of ǫ since
ηφ1 is a strict subsolution to (Pǫ). Further, since −l ≤ Λǫ ≤ 0, there exist M, c such
that

(a + bk(vǫ − 1)+kp)Ls

p(vǫ − 1)+ ≤ M + c((vǫ − 1)+)r.

(4.57)

{Λǫ} = −∞

Using the Moser iteration technique as in Theorem 4.5 we obtain kvǫk∞ ≤ C ′. Therefore
∃L > 0 such that ηφ1 ≤ vǫ ≤ Lφ1. By using the arguments previously used in Case
i, we end up getting |vǫ|C1,δ( ¯Ω) ≤ C ′ for every ǫ > 0. The conclusion follows as in the
previous case of J(vǫ) < ǫ. Hence ¯I attains its minimum at u0.
Case b: inf
ǫ>0
Let us assume Λǫ ≤ −1. As above, we can similarly obtain vǫ ≥ ηφ1 for η > 0
small enough and independent of ǫ. Further, there exists a constant M > 0 such that
λg(x)tp−1 + µh(x)t−γ + f (x, t) + τ |t − u0(x)|r−1(t − u0(x)) < 0, ∀(τ, x, t) ∈ (−∞, −1] ×
Ω × (M, ∞).
From the weak comparison principle on (a + bk · kp)Ls
p(·), we get vǫ ≤ M for ǫ > 0
suﬃciently small. Since u0 is a local C 1 - minimizer, u0 is a weak solution to (1.1) and

of ǫ and the conclusion follows.

5. Appendix

The appendix will address a few results that have been used in this article. Lemma 5.2
guarantees the existence of a positive solution to (3.7), Lemma 5.5 will establish that
the functional ¯I veriﬁes the mountain pass geometry, whereas Lemma 5.4 guarantees
that a solution to (1.1) is greater than or equal to the solution to (3.7).

Remark 5.1. By saying “u > 0 in Ω” we will mean ess inf
V ⊂ Ω.

u > 0 for any compact set

a.e. in Ω, where ǫµ > 0 is a constant.

28

Proof. We follow the proof in [19]. Firstly, we note that an energy functional on X0
formally corresponding to (5.1) can be deﬁned as follows.

E(u) =

(5.2)

for u ∈ X0. By the Poincar´e inequality, this functional is coercive and continuous on
X0. It follows that E possesses a global minimizer u0 ∈ X0. Clearly, u0 6= 0 since
E(0) = 0 > E(ǫv0) for suﬃciently small ǫ and some v0 > 0 in Ω.
Secondly, we have the decomposition u = u+ − u−. Thus if u0 is a global minimizer for
E, then so is |u0|, by E(|u0|) ≤ E(u0). Clearly enough, the equality holds iﬀ u−
0 = 0
a.e. in Ω. In other words we need to have u0 ≥ 0, i.e. u0 ∈ X0 where

X +

0 = {u ∈ X0 : u ≥ 0 a.e. in Ω}

is the positive cone in X0.
Third, we will show that u0 ≥ ǫv0 > 0 holds a.e.
that,

whenever 0 < ǫ ≤ ǫµ for some suﬃciently small ǫµ. We now show that u0 ≥ ǫµv0. On
the contrary, suppose w = (ǫµv0 − u0)+ does not vanish identically in Ω. Denote

Ω+ = {x ∈ Ω : w(x) > 0}.

We will analyse the function ζ(t) = E(u0 + tw) of t ≥ 0. This function is convex owing
to its deﬁnition over X +
0 being convex. Further ζ ′(t) = hE′(u0 + tw), wi is nonnegative
and nondecreasing for t > 0. Consequently for 0 < t < 1 we have

0 ≤ ζ ′(1) − ζ ′(t) = hE′(u0 + w) − E′(u0 + tw), wi

by inequality (5.3) and ζ ′(t) ≥ 0 with ζ ′(t) being nondecreasing for every t > 0, which
is a contradiction. Therefore w = 0 in Ω and hence u0 ≥ ǫµv0 a.e. in Ω.
Finally, the functional E being strictly convex on X +
critical point of E in X +
Therefore we choose uµ = u0 in the cutoﬀ functional.

u0 > 0 for any compact subset V ⊂ Ω.

Remark 5.3. We now perform an apriori analysis on a solution (if it exists). Suppose
u is a solution to (1.1), then we observe the following

29

1. I(u) = I(|u|). This implies that u− = 0 a.e. in Ω.

2. In fact a solution to (1.1) can be considered to be positive, i.e. u > 0 a.e. in Ω

due to the presence of the singular term.

Thus without loss of generality, we assume that the solution is positive.

Precisely, we now have the following result.

Lemma 5.4 (Apriori analysis). Fix a µ ∈ (0, µ0). Then a solution of (1.1), say u > 0,
is such that u ≥ uλ a.e. in Ω.

Proof. Fix µ ∈ (0, µ0) and let u ∈ X0 be a positive solution to (1.1) and uλ > 0 be
a solution to (5.1). We will show that u ≥ uλ a.e.
in Ω. Thus, we let Ω = {x ∈ Ω :
u(x) < uλ(x)} and from the equation satisﬁed by u, uλ, we have

0 ≤h(a + bkuλkp)Ls

puλ − (a + bkukp)Ls

Further we have

pu, uλ − uiΩ ≥ 0.

(5.5)

(5.6)

Hence, from (5.5) and (5.6), we obtain u ≥ uλ a.e. in Ωc.

Lemma 5.5. The redeﬁned functional ¯I given in (3.8) veriﬁes the mountain pass
geometry for µ ∈ (0, µ0) with µ0 < ∞.

¯I(u) ≥ a(r) > 0

for any µ ∈ (0, µ0) and for every u such that kuk = r. On the other hand, taking
u ∈ X0 and t ≥ 0 we have ¯I(tu) → −∞ as t → ∞. This veriﬁes the second condition
of the Mountain pass theorem.

Conclusions

Existence of inﬁnitely many solutions to the problem in (1.1) has been proved.
In
addition, a weak comparison result has been proved. It has also been shown that the
solutions are in L∞(Ω) when K(x) = |x|−N −sp. Further for this particular kernel K,
it has also been proved that the C 1 minimizers are the W s,p
0 minimizers as well. Some
future scope of work on this line would be to prove that the C 1 minimizers are the
W s,p

0 minimizers as well for a general Kernel satisfying (1.2).
