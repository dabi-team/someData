Abstract

Two-proton radioactivity with 2p halo is reported theoretically in light mass nuclei A = 18-34. We predict
19Mg, 22Si, 26S, 30Ar and 34Ca as promising candidates of ground state 2p-radioactivity with S2p < 0 and
Sp > 0. Observation of extended tail of spatial charge density distribution, larger charge radius and study
of proton single particle states, Fermi energy and the wave functions indicate 2p halo like structure which
supports direct 2p emission. The Coulomb and centrifugal barriers in experimentally identiﬁed 2p unbound
22Si show a quasi-bound state that ensures enough life time for such experimental probes. Our predictions
are in good accord with experimental and other theoretical data available so far.

Keywords: Relativistic mean-ﬁeld theory; Nilson Strutinsky approach; Two-proton radioactivity; One-
and Two-proton separation energy; Halo nuclei, Proton drip-lines.

Two-proton radioactivity, a simultaneous decay
of two protons from exotic nuclei near or beyond
proton drip line [1, 2, 3, 4], is a recently discovered
[2, 5, 6], a relatively lesser known exotic nuclear de-
cay mode that has attracted a lot of attention in
the recent times. For a 2p-radioactive nucleus Sp
> 0 and S2p < 0 which means that 1p should not
be an open decay channel [7] so that the two va-
lence protons are emitted simultaneously where the
role of pairing interaction becomes signiﬁcant. This
valence 2p weakly bound system in the decay chan-
nel might form a halo [8, 9, 10, 11] like structure in
the low density nuclear matter which is spatially far
from the tightly bound core system and may lead to
enhanced probability of direct 2p decay. The pair-
ing studies are expected to give new insights into
the role of 2p halo of the 2 valence proton system
in the direct 2p emission. However 2p correlations
[12, 13] in 2p decay and its mechanisms are still
not clear and require further theoretical and exper-
imental investigations [1].

So far 2p-radioactivity has been observed in the
decay of ground state 45Fe [1, 14], 54Zn [15, 16],
48Ni [17, 18], 67Kr [19], 19Mg [20], 30Ar [21], 31Ar

[22, 23] 20Mg [24, 25, 26], and excited states 22Mg
and 94Ag (for 1p and 2p decay) [27, 28] in experi-
mental and theoretical [29, 30] works have provided
useful insights into this exotic decay mode of proton
rich nuclei. Recent experimental observations of (i)
β-delayed two-proton emission in the decay of 22Si
[31] (ii) 2p correlated emissions in 28,29S but not
in 27,28P which indicated [8, 9, 10] that the dipro-
ton correlations may result from proton conﬁgura-
tion in the initial state like 2p halo rather than the
deformed orbit (iii) and the speculation [11] that
the 2p halo plays an important role in the diproton
emission, lack a precise theoretical description that
has invoked the present study. The objective in
this letter is to search for 2p halo and 2p unbound
nuclear systems in even Z=12 to 20 in a theoretical
framework and present for the ﬁrst time an analysis
to probe the interdependence between the weakly
bound 2p halo like structure and the direct 2p emis-
sion.

2p-radioactivity which is essentially the ener-
getically allowed simultaneous two-proton emission
is investigated by employing two simple and ef-
fective well established theoretical formalisms (i)
Relativistic mean-ﬁeld plus state dependent BCS
(RMF+BCS) approach [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]

and (ii) Macroscopic-microscopic approach (Mac-
Mic) with Nilson Strutinsky (NS) prescription [30,
39]. We calculate one- and two-proton separa-
tion energies of proton rich Mg, Si, S, Ar and Ca
isotopes near proton drip-line and identify 19Mg,
22Si, 26S, 30Ar and 34Ca as potential candidates
of 2p-radioactivity in agreement with the avail-
able experimental data [20, 21, 31] for 19Mg, 22Si
and 30Ar. The structural evidences for the ex-
istence of halo are searched in the above identi-
ﬁed 2p emitters within the RMF+BCS approach
by investigating spatial density distribution, larger
charge radius, wave functions and single parti-
cle energies that reveal a halo like structure of
weakly bound protons which is the highlight of this
work. Another important feature here is to look
for a quasi bound state using RMF+BCS to pro-
vide ﬁnite life time to enable experimental study
in 2p unbound 22Si which has been recently iden-
tiﬁed a candidate of 2p-radioactivity experimen-
tally [8]. Although various theoretical approaches
[16, 20, 40, 41, 42, 43] have been used to study
2p unbound nuclei, the RMF+BCS approach to-
gether with a realistic mean-ﬁeld has proved a very
useful tool especially for drip line nuclei as shown
in our earlier works [37, 38, 44] where it has been
used to study magicity, weakly bound structure
and halos. (Description of detailed theoretical for-
malisms that are adequately described in our ear-
lier works, are avoided here. Kindly see references
(RMF+BCS [37, 38] and Mac-Mic [30, 39]) for de-
tails). Our calculations show consensus with ex-
perimental and other theoretical works and provide
much needed insights on this subject.

Two- and one- proton separation energy (S2p and
Sp) computed using RMF with TMA [45], NL3*
[46], NLSH [47] and PK1 [48] parameters and Mac-
Mic approach [30] are shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b)
respectively where we ﬁnd 19Mg, 22Si, 26S, 30Ar
and 34Ca to be 2p unbound with S2p < 0 and Sp
> 0. Our calculated values of S2p and Sp and the
prediction of the ﬁrst two-proton unbound nuclei
agree very well with the experimental data [49], re-
sults from various parameters of RMF and other
theories like nonrelativistic approach viz. Skyrme-
Hartree-Fock method with the HFB-24 functional
(described in Ref. [50]) and FRDM [51]. However,
we ﬁnd small anomaly for 34Ca and 26S for which all
the theories and experiment show S2p < 0 whereas
RMF shows 34Ca to be 2p bound with S2p > 0 and
one parameter (NL3*) of RMF shows 26S to be 2p
bound with S2p > 0. This anomaly requires further

investigation.

To probe the structure of 2p unbound orbitals,
we evaluate nuclear deformations using deformed
RMF approach [34, 36, 52, 53, 54] and Mac-Mic
approach [30, 39] where 22Si and 34Ca are found
to be spherical (β=0.0) in agreement with HFB [50]
and FRDM [51] and 19Mg, 26S and 30Ar show large
deformation which we study along with their neigh-
bouring isotopes to check if the deformation shows
any major structural changes in 2p unbound nu-
clei while moving from normally bound to unbound
nuclei. Our estimated β values for 19−21Mg (0.23,
0.19, 0.28), 26−28S (0.26, 0.26, 0.26) and 30−32Ar
(0.22, 0.21, 0.20) show a gradual variation without
any signiﬁcant structural diﬀerences between de-
formed 2p emitters and their neighbouring isotopes.
This suggests that the deformation appears to have
no role in inﬂuencing 2p emission as speculated in
recent works [8, 9, 10], where, mainly a 3-body si-
multaneous decay in phase space and 2p sequential
emission for odd-Z 27P while a diproton-type decay
for even-Z 28S indicated that the 2p halo-like struc-
ture rather than large deformation is responsible for
2p correlations which may play an important role
in the mechanism of 2p emission. However there
may not be any taboo to deformations inﬂuencing
2p emission in other nuclei which needs investiga-
tion in various mass regions theoretically as well as
experimentally to reach any conclusion on this.

The 2p emission can happen either by sequen-
tial decay, direct diproton decay or 3-body demo-

cratic decay. However in view of the suggestion
[5] that 2p halo would lead to larger spectroscopic
factor for a direct 2p decay than for a sequential
decay and the speculations [8, 9, 10, 11] that 2p
halo plays an important role in the diproton emis-
sion, we look for the structural evidences for the
existence and signiﬁcance of 2p halo in 2p emitters.
We study the charge density distribution and vari-
ation of proton single particle energies of sd shell
(1d5/2, 2s1/2, 1d3/2) within the spherical framework
of RMF with NL3* parameter for the experimen-
tally identiﬁed 2p emitter 22Si [31]. From charge
density distribution curves plotted in (Fig. 2(a))
it is evident that 22Si shows an extended tail in
the charge density distribution which is much more
extended than its neighboring isotope 24Si. This
indicates weakly bound halo like structure of last
two protons in the outer most shell in 22Si that
has more probability of decay by 2p emission than
relatively normally bound 24Si shows dependence
of 2p halo on 2p emission. The charge densities of
22−34Si calculated by Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method
with the HFB-24 functional are also shown in Fig.
2(b) where loosely bound structure of protons in
22Si match in a good deal with our calculations of
RMF and is a strong evidence in support of decay
via two-proton emission. Fig. 2(c) shows proton
single particle energies of sd shell where we note a
large gap between 1d5/2 and 2s1/2 that produces a
shell closure at Z= 14 which is an area of recent
interest as Si isotopes 34Si [55] and 48Si [56] have

been identiﬁed as doubly magic nuclei in agreement
with our calculations using RMF for 34Si (see in Fig.
2(c)). The gap between 1d5/2 and 2s1/2 in 34Si is
found to be quite large around 6 MeV which re-
duces to 1.6 MeV for 22Si while moving from N=20
to N=8 towards the drip-line. This gap decreases
from 7 MeV to 1.9 MeV and 7.4 MeV to 2.5 MeV us-
ing TMA and NLSH parameters respectively. Due
to the reduced gap in 22Si, protons are partially
occupied in higher state 2s1/2 with non−zero oc-
cupancy of 0.33 whereas the other isotopes 24−48Si
have zero occupancy of proton in 2s1/2 state. The
Fermi energy (shown in Fig. 2(c)) in 22Si seems to
be very close to this occupied 2s1/2 state which indi-
cates somewhat loosely bound valence protons near
Fermi level in 22Si comprising a 2p halo like struc-
ture which is more likely to decay by 2p emission
as compared to other isotopes of Si. This analysis
provides a strong evidence towards the signiﬁcant
role of 2p halo in 2p decay. The charge density

Figure 3: Variation of charge density for few isotopes of
Mg, Si, S and Ar near drip-line calculated by deformed
RMF+BCS approach [52].

for deformed two-proton emitters 19Mg, 26S, 30Ar
along with 22Si calculated by RMF+BCS approach
including deformation [52] is shown in Fig. 3. It
is again remarkable to ﬁnd the well spread density
tail for these proton emitters in comparison to their
neighboring isotopes indicating halo like structure.
Due to extended density distribution of loosely
bound protons, the charge radii is expected to grow
larger. In order to check this, we compute charge
radii of drip-line isotopes of Mg, Si, S, Ar and Ca
shown in Fig. 4 along with available experimental
data [57]. We observe much larger charge radii of

19Mg, 22Si, 26S, 30Ar (seen very evidently in Fig.
4) which is another strong evidence in the support
of halo like structure in 2p emitters and thier possi-
ble inﬂuence on 2p decay which has not been shown
earlier. Here we used deformed RMF approach with
NL3*, TMA, NLSH and PK1 parameters that are
in reasonable match with each other. Furthermore
the diﬀerence between proton radius of 22Si and the
daughter nucleus 20Mg is found very large which
suggests that the removal of two loosely bound pro-
tons from 22Si after 2p emission results in a more
conﬁned conﬁguration of 20Mg which is more sta-
ble with extra binding B/A = 6.724 MeV as com-
pared to B/A = 6.058 MeV of 22Si. This shows
that 22Si with spherical conﬁguration is a loosely
bound drip-line nucleus which decays via 2p emis-
sion and gains stability. Much larger charge radii
in deformed 2p emitters 19Mg, 26S and 30Ar indi-
cates loosely bound halo like structure in well de-
formed nuclei and is in conformity with the specu-
lation [8, 9, 10, 11] that 2p halo is responsible for
2p correlations rather than the large deformation.
However, the result for 34Ca is found albeit in dif-
ference for RMF theory where the charge radii is
not much enlarged and also S2p > 0 although the
experimental data [49] and other theories show S2p
<0 and support energetically favoured 2p emission
in 34Ca which needs further investigation.

In order to explain this, we evaluate and plot nu-
clear potential, centrifugal barrier calculated for d
state (l=2), Coulomb barrier and total potential
which is sum of all three in Fig. 5. The nuclear
potential along with Coulomb and centrifugal bar-
riers has suﬃcient barrier height for the trapping of
waves to form a quasi-bound state which enable 22Si
to acquire rather long mean life time even it is un-
bound against two-proton emission and eventually
22Si may decay by the process wherein two-protons
tunnel through the barrier leading to observation of
two-protons radioactivity (shown by thick solid line
in Fig. 5(a)). Due to the barrier eﬀect, such a meta-
stable state remains mainly conﬁned to the region
of the potential well and the wave function exhibits
characteristics similar to that of a bound state. In-
deed wavefunctions of proton valence shells 1d5/2
and 2s1/2 of 22Si are found similar to the wavefunc-
tions of other bound isotopes (as seen in Fig. 5(b))
and remain in the potential region providing ﬁnite
life time. For comparison we also show wavefunc-
tion of 2s1/2 state of 20Si by solid line which signif-
icantly lies outside the potential region as seen in
Fig. 5(b) that indicates an unbound nucleus. Inter-
estingly, in 22O, the mirror nucleus of 22Si, Coulomb
barrier is absent for N=14 therefore neutron 2s1/2
state is found with -4.2 MeV energy that leads to a
perfect bound nucleus.

To conclude, two-proton radioactivity, a rela-
tively lesser known exotic nuclear decay mode along
with 2p halo are investigated in light mass region
around A = 18-34 by employing (i) RMF+BCS ap-
proach and (ii) Macroscopic-microscopic approach
with Nilson Strutinsky prescription. We predict
19Mg, 22Si, 26S, 30Ar and 34Ca as 2p-radioactive
in their ground state with S2p < 0 and Sp > 0. 22Si
and 34Ca are found to be spherical whereas 19Mg,
26S and 30Ar show large deformations. Structural
evidences for the existence of 2p halo in the 2p emit-
ters are searched within the RMF+BCS approach.
We observe long tail in extended spatial density dis-
tribution and larger charge radius in 19Mg, 22Si,
26S, 30Ar (except 34Ca) indicate 2p halo in 2p emit-
ters. Study of single particle states reveals weakly
bound halo like structure of protons due to weaken-
ing of shell gap and occupancy in proton 2s1/2 state
shown for experimentally identiﬁed nucleus 22Si fur-
ther emphasizes the existence of 2p halo and its
role in supporting 2p emission. The nuclear poten-
tial along with Coulomb and centrifugal barriers in
22Si appear to form a quasi-bound state to ensure
a long delay in the decay of 22Si that may result its
existence for ﬁnite life time and enable experimen-
tal probe. 2p-radioactivity and the link between 2p
halo and diproton emission need more eﬀorts on the
experimental and theoretical fronts.
