Abstract:  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  is  one  of  the  most  common  neurodevelopmental 
disorders in which patients have difficulties related to inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Those 
patients are in need of a psychological therapy use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to enhance the 
way they think and behave. This type of therapy is mostly common in treating patients with anxiety 
and depression but also is useful in treating autism, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic 
stress disorder. A major limitation of traditional CBT is that therapists may face difficulty in optimizing 
patients’ neuropsychological stimulus following a specified treatment plan. Other limitations include 
availability, accessibility and level-of-experience of the therapists. Hence, this paper aims to design and 
simulate  a  generic  cognitive  model  that  can  be  used  as  an  appropriate  alternative  treatment  to 
traditional CBT, we term as “AR-Therapist.” This model takes advantage of the current developments 
of augmented reality to engage patients in both real and virtual game-based environments.

1. Introduction 

Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been an increasing concern in the past few 
decades.  It  has  undefined  etiology,  as  a  heterogeneous  developmental  disorder,  leading  to  bias-  and 
extensive-diagnostic  evaluations  when  examining  patients  through  traditional  clinical  interviews  and 
ratings of patients’ behaviors [2,3]. ADHD in underage patients can be observed in patients’ hyperactivity 
(i.e., inability to control their impulses) and difficulty to pay attention which, as a result, will minimally 
intervene  with  their  social  engagements  and  the  continues  progress  of  their  normal  daily  lives.  In 
adulthood, patients with ADHD may have trouble managing time, being organized, setting goals, and 
holding down a job, which may lead to other problems related to relationships, self-esteem, and possibly 
addiction. The treatment of many psychological disorders, such as ADHD, can be through a well-known 
type  of  psychotherapy  called  Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy  (CBT).  CBT  involves  patients  in  multiple 
psychosocial interventions in order to improve their mental health. This treatment requires patients to 
go through multiple sessions with specialized therapists. In a case of ADHD, those sessions can be of 
increasing order of difficulty/complexity to provide patients with the ability to expand their cognitive 
capabilities and to overcome their current behavioral limitations. 

This highlights the usefulness of utilizing intelligent and immersive technologies, e.g., Augmented 
Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), for their promising results that have been stated in previous studies 
[4–9]. As the name suggests, augmented reality is the technology of combining real and 3D rendered 
virtual  contents  through  a  real-time  interactive  environment  [10].  Whereas,  the  technology  of  virtual

reality replaces real world with a computer-generated graphics via head mounted display [11]. In other 
words, the user in VR environment totally isolates the player from the real world while the AR optimizes 
the interactions with 3D objects in a real-world environment [12]. A major benefit of employing such 
technologies  (i.e.,  VR  and  AR)  to  mimic  traditional  CBT  besides  the  multi-level  of  virtuality  is  the 
automated capturing of a multi-sensory data, e.g., measurements of head movement and the angle of 
vision are recorded. These recordings help in providing quantitative support for the diagnosis, care and 
treatment of ADHD which have the ability to replace current labor-intensive techniques involving paper-
and-pencil methods or manual video analysis when collecting data. Unfortunately, previous proposed 
solutions fail to (a) overcome language and cultural barriers for diverse patients and to (b) employ the 
power of augmented reality by rendering 3D objects and avatars rather than solid textual instructions, 
which are essentials to increase patients’ engagements and to speed-up the recovery time. 

The belief is that there is no statistically significant difference between the ADHD patients who will 
be treated using traditional CBT and those who are treated by an automated-/online-system employing 
current advancements of augmented reality; although, online CBT may exceed traditional methods by 
accelerating recovery time and saving money and resources for both government and patients. This is 
due  to  achieving  a  concept  of  "a  therapist  for  each  patient"  as  the  system  mimics  the  therapist  roles 
through augmented reality techniques that provide it with features including: adaptiveness, smartness, 
responsiveness,  and  accuracy.  Other  advantages  are  availability,  accessibility,  and  assurance  of  the 
therapist’s  level-of-experience  which  cannot  be  guaranteed  in  traditional  CBT.  Therefore,  this  paper 
extends the work presented by the authors in [1] by introducing an AR-based system through modeling 
and  simulation  called  “AR-Therapist”  that  serves  as  an  online  CBT.  We  design  an  augmented  reality 
game using both Microsoft-HoloLens emulator—to tests mixed reality apps on a PC without a physical 
HoloLens— and Unity —a cross-platform game engine— applications to design a testbed for the system. 
Further, we defined set of measurements to evaluate the proposed system based on the idea of an increase 
in patient correct attention to choose a predefined object contributes positively to their performance index 
which means they are following along with their treatment plan. 

The article is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of some of the related work on 
the  different  techniques  used  as  a  CBT  through  multiple  virtuality  techniques  and  to  whether  such 
treatments support our claim. Section 3 proposes a formal modeling to main parameters used to define 
the  conceptual  model,  and  we  quantify  and  propose  measurements  to  identify  which  parameters 
contributes  most  to  the  increase  of  the  patient’s  recovery  performance  and  their  applicability  to  the 
treatment plan. Section 4 contributes an extensive experiment to support the proposed measurements by 
implementing  a  simple  game  that  reflects  the  usefulness  of  traditional  therapists.  Section  5  details  a 
hypothetical case study to contribute to the validity of our model and to provide detailed discussion. 
Section 6 draws conclusions and points to future possibilities. 

2. Literature Review 

Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder has undefined etiology as a heterogeneous developmental 
disorder  to  involve  hyperactivity  and  distractibility  as  well  as  difficulties  with  constant  attention, 
impulsive  control  disorder  and  impaired  cognitive  flexibility,  especially  in  problem  solving  and 
behavioral  management  [13,14].  Many  studies  have  indicated  the  potential  benefits  of  Virtual  Reality 
(VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) exposure therapy for many types of mental disorders [4–9]. In a study 
by  Parsons,  et  al.  [4],  attention  performance  was  compared  between  10  children  with  ADHD  and  10 
normal  control  children  in  a  VR  classroom.  The  results  showed  that  children  with  ADHD  are  more 
impacted  by  distraction  in  the  VR  classroom.  In  spite  of  that,  Ben-Moussa,  et  al.  [15]  proposed  a 
conceptual  design  of  an  exposure  therapy  system  called  DJINNI  for  social  anxiety  disorder.  DJINNI 
integrates the AR and VR technologies to provide more effective exposure therapy solutions for patient 
with social anxiety disorder.

Cho, et al. [16] conducted a study that examined usefulness to use VR for rehabilitation. Their study 
involved 30-participants with ADHD. The participants were trained in one of three groups: a VR group 
with  a  head-mounted  display,  a  desktop  equivalent  training  group  or  a  control  group.  The  attention 
abilities  of  the  participants  were  assessed  based  on  completing  a  continuous  performance  task  that 
required response to specific target stimuli that were shown for only 250 ms. The results showed that the 
VR group had significantly higher rates of correct response and a decreased perceptual sensitivity and 
response  bias  when  compared  with  the  other  two  groups.  Strickland,  et  al.  [17]  conducted  two 
experimental studies to examine the effectiveness of VR therapy among children with autism spectrum 
disorder. The outcome was positive, i.e., learning through virtual reality is effective for children with 
autism,  and  the  children  engaged  smoothly  in  the  virtual  environments  as  well  as  in  following  the 
instructions. 

A  study  by  Akhutina,  et  al.  [18]  examined  the  influence  of  the  virtual  environment  on  spatial 
functioning in children with cerebral palsy. The study compared 12-children with this condition who 
received VR therapy to a control group of 9-children with same condition who did not receive the VR 
therapy. A few of the children who received VR therapy showed some enhancement when compared 
with the other control group. Moreover, Denise Reid [19] examined the effectiveness of VR treatment for 
cerebral palsy in several studies. The focus of these studies was to investigate the effectiveness of VR 
treatment on feelings of self-efficacy, upper-extremity control, postural control and feelings of control 
and competency. In each of these studies, children diagnosed with different severities of cerebral palsy 
were  involved  in  a  series  of  interactive  VR  games.  In  three  controlled  studies  by  Reid  [20],  the 
effectiveness  of  this  involvement  on  children’s  self-efficacy  was  examined  based  on  interviews  and 
performance  measures.  Results  showed  that  VR  treatment  improved  the  self-efficacy  of  the  children 
when compared to previous reports for the children. 

The  importance  of  the  simulation  used  in  VR  or  AR  is  to  predict  the  capability,  limitation  and 
performance  of  a  system  and,  as  a  result,  will  lead  to  a  reduction  in  costs  and  hazards  for 
experimentations  compared  with  what  is  observed  in  traditional/hands-on  methods  [21].  An 
enhancement of those virtual/augmented simulated environments can be achieved through 106 agent-
based modeling. The use of such a model produces a simulation with a high degree of fidelity [22]. In a 
study by Starner, et al. [23], the authors implemented an agent-based model in an augmented simulated 
environment using wearable computing devices and were able to develop a system that analyzes user 
activities and predict near-future possible needs. Another study, in [21], has proposed a new approach 
of  introducing  synthetic  agents  in  motion  at  real-time  into  a  real-life  video  depending  on  a  terrain 
database and graphical rendering. 

The  rich  literature  on  the  confluence  between  augmented  reality  simulation  and  disorders’ 
enhancement therapy has provided our approach with quite valuable inputs. The deployment of those 
components into this work in order to efficiently exploit their many advantages results in several features 
of  the  system  that  may  include  but  not  limited  to  intelligence,  adaptiveness,  responsiveness,  and 
accuracy. This is because our interest is on developing a software system using an augmented reality 
simulated environment in order to help patients suffering from ADHD to find the treatment they need 
in the easiest and the fastest way possible, which has set it apart from traditional prior techniques. 

3. AR-Therapist: Generic Design 

This section defines the generic assembly of the model whereas the following section provide a case 

specific implementation and discussion. 

3.1. A Game Pipeline 

We present in this section a set of formal definitions to describe the logical flow for modeling the 

AR-Therapist. 

 
Healthcare 2019, 7, 146

1.  Treatment  is  the  whole  treatment  system  (i.e.,  AR-Therapist).  Its  profile  is  a  tuple  of: 

〈	Patient, Doctor, Game, {Treatment − Plan}	〉 
•  Patient: Each patient will have his/her own profile. The profile has to be complete for the 

patient to join the treatment program. 

•  Doctor: Each doctor will have his/her own profile. 
•  Game: The game has to be defined by the doctor considering patients current mental state 

and the disorder severity. 
{Treatment − Plan}: Players will go through a treatment program following a predefined. 
treatment plan that includes playing an AR-based game consisting of a set of levels. 

• 
• 

2.  Patient:  〈	ID, Level, Performance − Index, {Preference}	〉 

• 

ID: is a short identification as a name or a referral number used by the doctor to define a 
patient. 

•  Level: The level to where the patient has arrived in the treatment plan. 
•  Performance − Index: The current value of performance the patient has achieved throughout 

• 

the game. 
{Preference}: The set of predefined preferences for a patient considering other psychological 
disorders that may affect current design and methodology of the treatment plan. 

3.  Doctor:  〈	ID, Experience, Involvement	〉 

• 

ID:  The  doctor  has  to  have  his/her  own  profile  that  is  different  from  other  therapists  or 
psychological centers. This will give the doctor an access to the patient profiles and progress 
reports to allow for further evaluations. 

•  Experience:  Experience  level  of  the  doctor  is  useful  in  allowing  access  to  more 

• 

complex/detailed data of the patients. 
Involvement: The level of engagement within the treatment process which allow the doctor 
to  get  involved  in  the  game  and  in  the  reporting  progress  along  the  way  of  the  patient 
assigned treatment. 
4.  Game:  〈	Type, {Level}	〉 

•  Type: The type of the game to be played that has to be suitable for the patient. e.g., drag-

and-drop and multiple-choices. 
{Level}: The game consists of a set of levels that have different levels of complexity. 

• 

5.  Level:  〈	{Object}, Max − Time, Effects	〉 

{Object}: Maximum set of objects used in this level. 

• 
•  Max − Time:  A  predefined  maximum  time  for  the  whole  level  to  be  completed  or  abort 

otherwise.

following. 

6.  Object:  〈	Shape, Size, Random − Location, Visibility	〉 

• 
• 

Shape: The structure of an object has to be predefined beforehand the start of a session. 
Size: The size of an object will depend on the location and closeness from the player focal 
point. 

•  Random − Location: The initial distribution of objects around the real environment. 
•  Visibility: The appearance of one object after another. 

7.  Treatment-Program:  〈	{Game − session}, Performance − Measures, Duration	〉 

{Game − session}: The set of game session to complete the treatment program. 

• 
•  Performance − Measures: The performance in one session reports the correct, incorrect and 

uncompleted tried the patient has gone through in one session. 

•  Duration: The maximum treatment time for the whole treatment program, e.g., 20 min to 

complete the treatment. 

8.  Game-session:  〈	Level, Timer, Current − Location, Number − of − Tries	〉 

 
Healthcare 2019, 7, 146

•  Level: The game level has to be defined beforehand. The initial level is defined in the patient 
profile and player can move from one level to another asynchronously depending on his/her 
achievement in the session and then the patient profile is updated. 

•  Timer: To count the response time for the patients. 
•  Current − Location:  To  track  current  location  of  the  patient  for  measuring  closeness  from 

objects within a session. 

•  Number − of − Tries: The repetition of tries within one session to include correct, incorrect 
and uncompleted tries. e.g., the number of collected target objects the patient has correctly 
collected in one session. 

To this end, we have introduced eight-profiles that best formulate the AR-Therapist model when 

merged together. Next, we show the process of combining those profiles into a conceptual model. 

3.2. General Conceptual Model 

The conceptual model consists of four layers: (a) interface layer, (b) configuration layer, (c) run-time 
layer  and  (d)  storage  layer.  Figure  1  depicts  an  architecture  of  the  AR-Therapist  based  on  the  eight-
profiles presented beforehand. 

1.  The interface layer contains the interfaces used for accessing other layers. For instance, doctor 
can use a user-friendly interface to configure the treatment plan, whereas players interact with 
the game through Augmented Reality glasses. 

2.  The Configuration layer consists of the “treatment plan configuration” component, where the 

doctor can add new treatment plan and configure the existence ones. 

3.  The Run-time layer has the components that interact with the player while the game is running. 

These components are: The Context-Agent component and the Game component. 
-  The  Context  Agent  component  retrieves  the  player  treatment  plan,  and  his/her 
performance in order to control the current game-session and guide the player based on the 
treatment  plan.  Furthermore,  the  context  agent  capable  of  monitoring  all  the  player’s 
behaviors and interactions with the environment, logging “Ethically” the needed data, and 
calculating the player’s performance following the equations highlighted in Section 3. Thus, 
the  agent  gains  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  patient  to  enrich  the  AR-Therapist  model 
based on appropriate reasoning techniques. This in turns can be utilized in the future for 
suggesting the most optimal treatment plan for new patient (e.g., when facing a “cold start 
issue”). In addition, logging the needed data and explaining them will reveal some hidden 
information which may help the ADHD community. 
On the other hand, there is a persistent need for employing an intelligent agent capable of 
performing the tasks explained above since the AR-Therapist model is used by the patients 
with  the  aid  of  their  families  and  under  the  doctors’  remote  supervision  (i.e.,  ambient 
assistant living “AAL”). Surveying the literature resulted in finding prior use of AAL such 
as  in  fall  detection  [24,25],  and  for  monitoring  elderly  in  their  homes  using  video 
surveillance [26,27]. 

-  The game Component involves levels of game; each level has its own games-sessions, and 
each game-session in turns contains the appropriate difficulty level that characterizes the 
maximum game-session time, used objects, and their locations. 

4.  The storage layer involves components which store data about the treatment-plan, treatment-
program, player profile, and game levels and objects. Each component follows an appropriate 
common specification for structuring the related data. Thus, the system’s extensibility can be 
guaranteed as well as the integration with the existence e-health systems.

3.3. Performance Measures 

One  of  the  most  important  issues  to  diagnose  and  treat  ADHD  patients  is  to  determine  a  set  of 
accurate  performance  measures.  These  performance  measures  should  have  the  ability  to  differentiate 
accurately  between  children  having  ADHD  symptoms  and  others  who  do  not  have  it.  According  to 
psychiatric recommendations, it would be better to collect these performance measures from children 
within different environments such as at home and at school [28]. 

There are many tests used to diagnose children with ADHD [29]. Continuous Performance Tests 
(CPT) are the most popular laboratory-based test supporting clinical diagnosis [30–32]. CPT is usually a 
computer-based  test  that  aims  to  measure  children  attention  and  impulsivity.  CPT  involves  the 
individual and random presentation of a series of visual or auditory stimuli that changes rapidly over a 
period of time. Children are informed to respond to the “target” stimulus and avoiding a “non-target” 
stimulus. The test provides summary statistics of performance parameters (e.g., response time, average 
response  time,  response  time  standard  deviation,  omission  errors,  and  commission  errors).  These 
parameters  have  been  shown  to  be  useful  in  the  detection  of  ADHD  [33].  An  important  limitation  of 
traditional  CPTs  is  low  ecological  validity  [34].  Ecological  validity  means  the  degree  to  which  a 
performance test produces results similar to those produced in real life [35]. One approach to improve 
assessment  methods  which  offers  better  ecological  validity  is  CPTs  based  on  VR,  such  as  the  Aula 
Nesplora test [36]. Those approaches have an advantage of being more realistic and ecologically-valid 
environment while still having the ability to assess the degree of ADHD severity. Using AR instead of 
VR will further improve the ecological validity of the performed test. 

In this paper, multiple performance measures are used to provide ADHD diagnostics and treatment 
assessment.  Thus,  let  us  assume  that  we  have  an  AR-game  that  frequently  present  an  interactive 
environment with the following assumptions: 

 
 
 
Healthcare 2019, 7, 146

T: Number of tries in one session. 
C: Number of correct tries in one session. 
I: Number of incorrect tries (due to omission or commission errors) in one session. 
K: Number of uncompleted tries in one session. 

𝑇 = 𝐶 + 𝐼 + 𝐾 

𝐼	 = 	𝑂𝐸	 + 	𝐶𝐸	

(1)

Then, the performance measures that will be used for providing ADHD diagnostics and treatment 

assessment include: 

•  Correct Response Times (CRT): The percentage of measuring attention deficits for the time spent 

on the correct tries. 

•  Mean of the CRT (M): To compare with correct response time to make sure they follow opposite 

relation to one another.

•  Try time (𝜃): The maximum allowed time to complete one try within a session. 
•  Omission errors (OE): The absence of any response during a try period to be used to measure 

inattention. 

•  Commission  errors  (CE):  The  response  to  non-target  stimuli  which  to  be  used  to  measure 

impulsivity.

Previous measurements are normalized within the interval (0–1). In Equation (3), CRT measures the 
length of time that the child takes to make a correct try (i.e., choose the target object in the try). The longer 
the CRT is, the more likely the child has attention deficit. This is because one of the symptoms of attention 
deficit is that the child cannot focus on tasks. As a result, the child takes a longer time compared to normal 
children when doing a task (i.e., choosing the target object in our case). We use the mean of all CRTs (M) 
in the game session to measure the attention deficit of the child. In addition, the standard deviation of 
CRTs (SD) is used in Equation (4) to indicate the impulsivity and hyperactivity of the child. The higher 
the value of SD, the more probability that the child suffers from impulsivity and hyperactivity. A child 
with impulsivity and hyperactivity has difficulty in controlling his moves after a certain period of time. 
As a result, the child starts periodically to move with no destination. Such a child in our case, will have 
great differences among CRTs because the impulsivity and hyperactivity will hinder him from moving 
towards  the  target  object  in  some  tries.  Engagement  Factor  (GF),  in  Equation  (5),  indicates  the 
engagement-level of the child in the game. In our case, the child is considered to be engaged in the game 
of s/he keeps playing the game. In contrast, the child is considered to be not engaged if s/he stops the 
game before completing all tries in the session. Thus, GF is defined as the number of correct and incorrect 
tries (C + I) divided by the total number of tries (T) in the session. 

Inattention Factor (IAF) which is defined in Equation (6) indicates the child inattention. In our case, 
the child inattention increases when he makes Omission Errors (OE) in the session, i.e., when the patient 
does not choose any of the objects appearing to him/her. The number of uncompleted tries (K) in the 
session should be excluded when indicating IAF. Thus, IAF is defined as the number of OEs divided by 
𝐶	 + (	𝐼 ∙ 	𝐶) 	 + 	𝐼	 = 	𝑇 − 	𝐾 .  Impulsivity  Factor  ( 𝐼𝑀𝐹 )  in  Equations  (7)  is  defined  as  the  number 
commission errors divided by number of correct and incorrect tries. We also exclude K when defining 
IMF. In our case, the child who suffers from impulsivity will likely make more commission errors because 
impulsivity  will  prevent  him/her  from  focusing  when  choosing  an  object.  Error  Factor  (EF),  given  in 
Equation (8), indicates the child error rate. The error in our case includes omission and commission errors 
excluding  𝐾 .  Thus,  𝐸𝐹   is  equal  to  𝐼𝐴𝐹	 + 	𝐼𝑀𝐹 .  Correct  Response  Factor  (CRF),  in  Equation  (9), 
measures the percentage of the correct response of the child in one session. In our case, CRF should be 
negatively affected by the amount of time that the child takes when he makes an incorrect try. Thus, we 
define CRF as the total summation of CRTs to the actual time of the game during the session (GT). In this 
case, CRF will be 100% if the child makes all tries correctly. Otherwise, it will decrease depending on the 
total amount of time spent by the child on incorrect tries. 

The final performance measure which is given in Equation (8) is the Performance Index (PI). PI is a 
composite score which measures the overall performance of the child. In our case, we want the PI of the 
child to be affected positively by his CRF and negatively by his EF. In addition, we need to take into 
account different possible scenarios that can happen in the game session. One possible scenario is that 
the child does not complete all the tries in the session. The child can make one correct try and stop the 
game before finishing all the tries in the session. If we only considered the CRF and EF, the PI in the case 
would be the highest. In order to prevent this from happening, we consider the GF in the definition of 
PI.  Another  possible  scenario  is  that  we  have  two  children  who  have  the  same  CRF,  EF,  and  GF  but 
different GT. In this case, they will have the same PI. However, the child who has less GT should have a 
higher PI. Thus, we considered the ratio of GT to the maximum Session Time (ST) in the definition of PI. 
The PI of the child should be affected negatively by this ratio. 

4. Implementation

Patients with a predefined ADHD disorder are having difficulty concentrating on a specific task. 
Therapists usually use simple concentration games with children in order to help with increasing their 
concentration. We imitate the usefulness of traditional games using an augmented reality environment. 
The  use  of  the  AR  environment  is  more  suitable  to  children  than  virtual  ones  since  it  allows  them  to 
observe  their  current  location  while  the  game  is  being  introduced.  Major  benefit  of  the  game-based 
environment  entails  on-time  measurements  and  instant  reporting  which  in  part  makes  the  job  of 
specialized therapists much easier. 

The game is simply a simulation of two 3D-balls: one is the target ball, and another is not. The player 
should follow the instructions and hits the target ball with a specified time period which will add to the 
values of correct hits. If not, the value will be added to the incorrect hits as an omission or commission 
error and taking out from the total number of tries the player has to complete to finish a session. We used 
Unity in the design of the AR game, and the test was through the Microsoft HoloLens emulator. Figure 
2 shows a screenshot of the game before and after the patient hits the target ball. 

Figure 2. Basic design of the game where one ball is the target while another is the non-target. Above 
images are before and after hitting the target ball or the wrong ball: (a) Initial screen, (b) Dropping the 
correct ball, and (c) Dropping the wrong ball. 

The  child  can  play  many  game  sessions  during  one  treatment  session.  The  number  of  sessions 
depend on his performance in the game and his engagement level. Currently, the game consists of only 
one level. Each game session consists of 10-trials of one minute each. In each trial, the “target” and the 
“non-target” ball will appear to the child. The child will be directed to catch the target ball so that it will 
be dropped down during the trial interval. The time elapsed from the beginning of the trial until hitting 
the target is the correct response time. If this time decreases, this is an indicator that the performance of 
the child has improved. If the child was not able to catch any of the balls, this is an omission error which 
indicates  inattention.  If  s/he  caught  the  non-target  ball,  this  is  a  commission  error  which  indicates 
impulsivity. The proposed game-based model can be described using the following steps: 

1.  The child starts the game session.

2.  A brief explanation of the game is presented to the child along with an indication of the target 

ball. 

3.  A timer is started to count 60 seconds of the first trial. 
4.  The trial is ended in four situations. Firstly, if the child selected the target ball. Secondly, if s/he 
selected the non-target ball (commission error). Thirdly, the time is out, and s/he did not choose 
any ball (omission error). Finally, if s/he ends the game. 

5.  The trial statistical data are recorded. 
6. 
If it is not the tenth trial or the game is not ended, the next trial begins. 
7.  All performance parameters are calculated and recorded for further analysis. 

5. Experimentation with a Case Study 

A case study is developed as a simulation of practicing the game. The purpose of the case study is 
to  validate  the  accuracy  and  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  model.  The  case  study  is  divided  into  two 
parts. In the first part, we need to study the effect of number of correct tries and number of errors on the 
performance index. While in the second part, we need to study the effect of patient’s engagement in the 
game on the performance index. 

The first part of the experiment consists of three phases, each phase uses 20 sessions and represents 
different combination of the number of correct tries (C), the number of omission errors (OE), the number 
of Commission errors (CE), and the number of uncompleted tries (K). In all phases, we consider the value 
of  𝐾	 = 	0. This is due to the need to show only the effect of the number of correct tries versus the number 
of errors on the value of the performance index (PI). In the first phase, we set the value of  𝐶	 = 	3  and I 
= 7. In the second phase, we set the value of  𝐶	 = 	𝐼	 = 	5. Finally, in the third phase, we set the value of 
𝐶	 = 	8  and  𝐼	 = 	2. Table 1 shows the values of different parameters and performance measures used in 
the first part of the experiment. In Table 1, we assumed that the patient was fully engaged in the game 
during the three phases (𝐾	 = 	0  and	𝐺𝐹	 = 	100%). We can also notice that the mean (M) and standard 
deviation  (SD)  values  of  the  correct  response  times  are  very  similar  across  all  three  phases.  In  each 
successive phase, the PI values continue to improve depending only on the number of correct and error 
tries.

Figure 3 shows three PI curves corresponding to the three phases of the experiment. In each phase, 
we assumed that the correct response time for each patient to improve gradually with each trial in each 
session  and  in  successive  sessions  as  the  patient  continues  to  get  more  familiar  with  game  and  its 
environment. The PI values improve during all sessions in the same phase of the experiment due to the 

 
Healthcare 2019, 7, 146 

11  of  14 

improvement in the correct response time from one session to the next. Also, we can observe that the PI 
values improve further from one phase to the next as the number of errors decreased and the number of 
correct tries increased. 

Figure  3.  Different  values  for  the  performance  index,  by  implementing  Equation  (9).  The  lower  line 
presents a static value of C = 3 and I = 7. The mid-line presents an equal value for C = I = 5. The upper line 
presents the values of C = 8 while I = 2. 

The second part of the experiment consists of four phases, each phase also uses 20 sessions. For all 
phases, the number of errors is considered to be zero (EF = 0%). Only the effect of changing the numbers 
of correct tries and uncompleted tries (patient engagement) are considered. In the first phase, we set the 
value of C = 3 and K = 7. In the second phase, we set the value of C = 5 and K = 5. In the third phase, we 
set the value of C = 7 and K = 3. Finally, in the fourth phase, we set the value C = 10 and K = 0. 

Table 2 shows the values of different parameters and performance measures used in the second part 
of the experiment. The assumption is that the patient did not make any errors during the four phases (OE 
= 0, CE = 0, and EF = 0%). Here again, we can notice that the mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) values 
of the correct response times are very similar across all four phases. In each successive phase, the PI value 
progresses based only on the number of completed tries during the game sessions (GFs).

In each phase, we assumed that the correct response time of the patient improved gradually with 
each trial in each session and also in successive sessions as the patient gets more familiar with the game 
and its environment. 

Figure  4.  Different  values  for  the  performance  index,  by  implementing  Equation  (9).  The  lower  line 
presents a static value of C = 3 and K = 7. The second line present an equal value for C = K = 5. The third 
line presents a static value of C = 7 and K = 3. The upper line presents the values of C = 10 while K = 0. 

As Figure 4 shows, the PI values are getting improved during all sessions in the same phase of the 
experiment due to the improvement in the correct response time from one session to the next. Also, we 
can  observe  that  the  PI  values  are  further  improved  from  one  phase  to  the  next  as  the  number  of 
completed tries, i.e., patient engagement, increases and the number of uncompleted tries decreases. 

6. Conclusion and Future Work 

The paper proposed a theoretical cognitive model that helps to enhance behavior of patients with a 
predefined ADHD using a game-based augmented reality environment that we called “AR-Therapist”. 
The purpose is to provide an online alternative to traditional CBT with a more advanced virtual one that 
may  exceed  traditional  CBT  methods  with  higher  time  and  resource  efficiency.  The  model  has  been 
implemented on a simulated augmented reality environment as a simple drop-the-ball game. The results 
have shown that there is an increase in patient’s correct attention to choose a predefined object which 
contributes positively to their performance index, i.e., they are following along with their treatment plan. 
AR-Therapist achieves an excellent accessibility level to every patient in need as it mimics the therapist 
role  through  utilizing  an  augmented  reality  game-based  environment  to  allow  for  features  such  as: 
adaptiveness, smartness, responsiveness, and accuracy. Other advantages are availability and assurance 
of the therapist’s level-of-experience which cannot be guaranteed in traditional CBT. Future work will 
provide  evaluations  involving  human  subjects  in  order  to  compare  the  proposed  AR-Therapist  with 
traditional CBT.
