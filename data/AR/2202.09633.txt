energy is released gradually. Combining high-quality observations from Solar
Dynamics Observatory and other instruments, we present the formation and im-
mediate deformation of a small ﬁlament (F1) in the active region (AR) 12760 on
28 – 30 April 2020. Before the ﬁlament formation, three successive dipoles quickly
emerged with separation motions in the center of AR 12760. Due to the magnetic
interaction between magnetic dipoles and pre-existing positive polarities, coronal
brightenings consequently appeared in the overlying atmosphere. Subsequently,
because of the continuous cancellation of magnetic ﬂux that happened around
the adjacent ends of F1 and another nearby ﬁlament (F2), the magnetic reconec-
tions occurred intermittently occurred between F1 and F2. Finally, F1 lessened
in the shear, and F2 became shorter. All the results show that the formation of
F1 was closely associated with intermittent interactions between the sequence
of emerging dipoles and pre-existing magnetic polarities, and the immediate
deformation of F1 was intimately related to intermittent interactions between
F1 and F2. We also suggest that the intermittent magnetic interactions driven
by the continuous magnetic activities (magnetic-ﬂux emergence, cancellation,
and convergence) play an important role in the formation and deformation of
ﬁlaments.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬁlaments consist of cold, and dense plasma suspended in the hot corona,
and are always located along polarity inversion lines (PILs) separating opposite
polarities of photospheric radial ﬁelds (Martin, 1998; Mackay et al., 2010). A
common feature in the solar corona, ﬁlaments are an active subject of research
in solar physics because a ﬁlament eruption can release a large amount of plasma
and magnetic ﬁeld and thus lead to a signiﬁcant disturbance for space weather.
The magnetic energy released in the eruption process is previously stored in
highly stressed/twisted coronal structures (Forbes, 2000; Low, 2001). Hence,
ﬁlament formation is the process of the accumulation of magnetic energy.

The formation mechanism of ﬁlaments is one main issue under debate. On the
one hand, ﬁlaments are thought to be formed in the solar interior and emerged
into the atmosphere through magnetic buoyancy (Low, 1994; Fan, 2001; Leake,
Linton, and T¨or¨ok, 2013). Fan (2009) studied a twisted ﬂux rope that emerged
from the solar interior to the corona through magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulation, and Yan et al. (2017) presented the emergence of a small-scale
ﬂux rope combing with the observations from New Solar Telescope and Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO). On the other hand, some studies have suggested
that ﬁlaments are directly formed in the corona through magnetic reconnections,
which could be driven by surface motions such as shear ﬂows along the PILs,
converging ﬂows to PILs, diﬀerential rotation, and magnetic cancellation (van
Ballegooijen and Martens, 1989; Yang et al., 2016; Threlfall, Hood, and Priest,
2018). Some observations revealed that the surface motion played important

Formation and Immediate Deformation of a Small Filament

roles in the ﬁlament formation. Chae et al. (2001) reported that the formation
of a ﬁlament was closely related to a large cancelling magnetic feature. Yan
et al. (2015) found that two successive ﬁlaments were formed by shear ﬂows
between opposite polarity magnetic ﬁelds and the rotation of a small sunspot.
Recently, Zheng et al. (2020) presented an example of a tiny ﬂux rope formed
by magnetic-ﬂux emergence, cancellation, and convergence.

After formation, the magnetic energy stored in the ﬁlament structure can be
intensely released in an eruption process. It is believed that ﬁlament eruptions
are intimately related with solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and
these three eruptive phenomena are diﬀerent parts of a solar eruption (Zhang
et al., 2001). Many theoretical models have been proposed to interpret the
trigger mechanisms of solar eruptions, such as the interior reconnection tether-
cutting model (Moore and Roumeliotis, 1992; Moore et al., 2001), the external
reconnection breakout model (Antiochos, DeVore, and Klimchuk, 1999), the
magnetic-ﬂux cancellation or emergence model (Heyvaerts, Priest, and Rust,
1977; Chen and Shibata, 2000), the MHD helical-kink instability model (T¨or¨ok,
Kliem, and Titov, 2004; Fan, 2005), and the MHD torus instability model (Bate-
man, 1978; Kliem and T¨or¨ok, 2006). In addition, ﬁlament eruptions occasionally
are fully failed/conﬁned (Ji et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2010; Joshi
et al., 2013; Song et al., 2014; Dalmasse et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2017a; Yang
and Zhang, 2018) or partially successful (Gilbert, Alexander, and Liu, 2007; Liu,
Alexander, and Gilbert, 2007; Shen, Liu, and Su, 2012; Zhang et al., 2015; Zheng
et al., 2017b; Cheng, Kliem, and Ding, 2018).

On the other hand, the stored magnetic energy can also be gently released in a
few times, and then the ﬁlament will only experience deformation, not eruption.
In this work, we present the formation and immediate deformation of a small
ﬁlament in active region (AR) center, and both formation and deformation were
closely associated with intermittent magnetic interactions involving magnetic-
ﬂux emergence, cancellation, and convergence.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

The formation and deformation of a small ﬁlament that occurred in NOAA AR
12760 (≈S06W29) during the period from 28 to 30 April 2020. The ﬁlament
was captured by Hα ﬁltergrams from the Solar Magnetic Activity Research
Telescope (SMART: UeNo et al., 2004) with the solar imaging system of the Solar
Dynamics Doppler Imager (Ichimoto et al., 2017) at the Hida Observatory, and
the Hα images have a cadence of one minute and a pixel size of ≈1(cid:48)(cid:48). Furthermore,
some high-resolution Hα ﬁltergrams from the 1.8-meter Chinese Large Solar
Telescope (CLST: Rao et al., 2015, 2020) are employed as a supplement, with a
pixel size of 0.077(cid:48)(cid:48).

In addition, we employed full-disk observations from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al., 2012) and from the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012) onboard the SDO (Pesnell, Thompson, and
Chamberlin, 2012). The magnetic-ﬁeld evolution of the source region during
the formation process and the subsequent magnetic cancellation beneath two

L. Zhang et al.

adjacent ends of ﬁlaments was checked by magnetograms and intensity maps
from the HMI, with a cadence of 45 seconds and pixel size of 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48). The coronal
response was recorded by the AIA images in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave-
lengths, with a pixel size of 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48) and a cadence of 12 seconds. The deformation
of the ﬁlament was also scanned in narrowband slit-jaw images (SJIs) from the
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS: De Pontieu et al., 2014), with a
cadence of 36 seconds and a pixel size of 0.332(cid:48)(cid:48).

The observations from the diﬀerent instruments were co-aligned by the obvi-
ous identical features (e.g. ﬁlaments and brightenings) by eye in the temporally
closest images. Several objects were co-aligned simultaneously and thus, to a
great extent, ensure that the cross-data comparisons we make are accurate and
reliable (approximately good to 5(cid:48)(cid:48)).

3. Results

3.1. Filament Formation

Figure 1 shows the magnetic-ﬁeld evolution of the source region (dashed boxes)
in AR 12760. Initially, AR 12760 only appeared as faint tiny pores in HMI-
intensity images (Panel a), and simply consisted of a leading positive polarity
(P0) and a following negative polarity (N0) in HMI magnetograms (Panel b).
At the interface between P0 and N0, some minor polarities (N0a and P0a-P0b)
were important for the following ﬁlament formation (Panel b). After 12:00 UT
28 April, some dipoles (P1a-N1a, P1b-N1b, P1c-N1c) successively emerged from
the gap between P0a-P0b and the majority (P0c) of P0, and the negative and
positive polarities (red and blue arrows) moved and converged eastwards and
westwards, respectively (Panels c – f). As a result of the continuous emergence
and convergence, the compact positive (P1) and negative (N1) polarities ﬁnally
formed at the beginning of 30 April, corresponding to the distinct positive and
negative sunspots (PS and NS), respectively (Panels g – h). The emergence of
dipoles is consistent with the obvious enhancement of positive and negative
magnetic ﬂux in the source region (Panel i). Besides, because of the separation
of dipoles, the eastward negative polarities (N1a, N1b, N1c) began to interact
with pre-existing P0a-P0b (green arrows in Panels d – f), which resulted in the
positive polarities nearly vanishing between N0 and newly formed N1 (Panel g).
The formation of a small ﬁlament in the center of AR 12760 was closely asso-
ciated with intermittent magnetic interactions between three emerging dipoles
and the pre-existing magnetic polarities (Figures 2 – 4). Figure 2 illustrates the
ﬁrst magnetic interaction associated with the P1a-N1a dipole. Some ﬁlament
threads (FT0; white arrows) rooted at P0a and N0a before the emergence of
P1a-N1a that brought the appearance of the ﬁlament threads (FT1; blue arrows)
connecting P1a and N1a (upper panels). During the emergence, N1a moved
eastwards close to P0a. Due to the approach, some brightenings appeared clearly
in the above atmosphere (green arrows in Panels e – f), which is the evidence of
magnetic cancellation between N1a and P0a (green arrows in Panels d and g).
As a result, a small concave (i.e. the center of the ﬁlament is curved towards

SOLA: sola_200430.tex; 2 August 2022; 0:57; p. 4

Formation and Immediate Deformation of a Small Filament

the center of the active region) ﬁlament (F1(cid:48)) formed connecting N0a and P1a
(cyan arrows in bottom panels).

The second magnetic interaction associated with the dipole of P1b-N1b is
shown in Figure 3. During the emergence of P1b-N1b, N1a not only kept in-
teracting with P0a, but also moved northwards and interacted with P0b (green
arrows in Panel a). As a result, some brightenings appeared in AIA 304 and 171˚A
(green arrows in Panels b – c). Since the emergence, N1b also moved eastwards
and mixed with N1a (red arrows in Panels d and g). The stronger N1ab continued
to interact with both P0a and P0b, and at the same time, N0a also canceled with
P0a and P0b (green arrows in Panel g). As a result, P0a and P0b became fainter
and fainter (left panels). Besides, the overlying concave F1(cid:48) became convex (i.e.
the center of the ﬁlament is curved away from the center of the active region)
F1(cid:48)(cid:48) (cyan arrows in Panels h – i). Note that the newly emerging ﬁlament threads
(FT2; yellow arrows in Panels e – f) connecting P1b and N1b barely contributed
to the ﬁlament formation. During the second interaction, the third dipole of
P1c-N1c quickly emerged (Panel g).

The third magnetic interaction associated with the dipole of P1c-N1c is shown
in Figure 4. During the emergence and separation, the ﬁlament threads (FT3;
yellow arrows) connecting P1c and N1c became longer, and N1c moved towards
P0b (upper panels). The approach lead to the magnetic interaction between N1c
and P0b and the following brightenings in the atmosphere above (green arrows
in second panels). Besides, N0a moved towards and mixed with N1abc, and it
constituted part of compact N1 (Panel i). Finally, an elongated ﬁlament (F1;
cyan arrows in bottom panels) formed, with two ends rooting at N1 and P1.
Overlying F1, a sheared hot loop in AIA 94˚A appeared (pink arrows in Panels
h and l). Meanwhile, another shorter ﬁlament (F2; white arrows) connecting
another dipole of P2-N2 located in the northeast of F1, and the south end of F2
was close to the east end of F1 (bottom panels).

3.2. Filament Deformation

The magnetic-ﬁeld evolution beneath the two ﬁlaments is shown in Figure 5.
In the sequence of HMI magnetograms (Panels a – e), it is obvious that some
micro positive polarities beneath the adjacent negative ends of ﬁlaments (N1
and N2) slowly disappeared and emerged and vanished again (white arrows). The
magnetic-ﬂux evolution (between 00:00 and 12:00 UT on 30 April) in the region
around N1-N2 (red boxes) is shown in Panel f. The positive ﬂux continuously
decreased and nearly vanished at 12:00 UT, with a net decrease of ≈ 25 × 1018
Mx. In the decreasing curve, there a bump at ≈08:00 UT (pink arrow), which
is consistent with the abrupt emergence and quick disappearance of the minor
positive polarity in Panels d – e. The curve indicates the continuous magnetic-
ﬂux cancellation around the negative ends of two ﬁlaments. As a result, the
north edge of N1 proﬁle was distorted.

Moreover, as the continuous magnetic-ﬂux cancellation beneath the adjacent
ﬁlament ends, the minor polarities of P2 and N2 moved towards each other. The
convergence of P2-N2 is shown in Figure 6. We tracked the closest part of two
polarities, the westernmost piece of N2 and the southernmost piece of P2 (N2(cid:48)

and P2(cid:48); yellow and red contours), and connect the centers of N2(cid:48) and P2(cid:48) with
the blue line. The length of the blue line (L1) and the angle θ1 between the
blue line and the horizontal line are used to analyse the convergence motion.
In the sequence of HMI magnetograms, L1 gradually decreased from ≈28.4(cid:48)(cid:48) to
≈14(cid:48)(cid:48), and θ1 gradually increased from ≈39.2◦to ≈90◦with a speed of ≈2.9◦h−1.
It indicates that the minor polarities related to the two ends of F2 experienced
a convergence motion, with a counterclockwise rotation.

As a result of continuous magnetic-ﬂux cancellation and emergence beneath
the adjacent ends of ﬁlaments, some brightenings successively appeared in the
upper atmosphere. Three obvious brightenings before 08:00 UT on 30 April are
exhibited in IRIS 1400˚A and AIA 304˚A (Figure 7 and Electronic Supplementary
Material Animation 2). The contours of HMI magnetograms are superposed and
the brightenings (yellow arrows) located between the micro positive polarities
(pink arrows) and N1 and N2. The close spatial relationship likely demonstrates
that the brightenings resulted from the magnetic-ﬂux cancellation beneath. In
addition, the brightenings in IRIS 1400˚A and AIA 304˚A were rarely seen in AIA
171˚A, which indicates that the brightenings plausibly occurred in the transition
region.

Following the intermittent brightenings beneath the ﬁlament ends, there oc-
curred an apparent interaction between two ﬁlaments (Figure 8 and Electronic
Supplementary Material Animation 3). At ≈08:04 UT (Panels a – c), a bright
point (yellow arrows) appeared from the low chromosphere to the high corona
between F1 and F2, and linked with brightenings (blue arrows) around the
four ends of the two ﬁlaments. It likely represents the X-type structure of
the magnetic reconnection that occurred in the interface of the two ﬁlaments.
Interestingly, some minutes later (Panel d), a bridge of cold ﬁlament material
appeared connecting F1 and F2 (white arrow). The bridge quickly disappeared
and was replaced by bright threads (pink arrows) that connected with the bright-
enings at the east end of F1 and the northern part of F2 (Panels f – g). Besides,
some faint loops (black arrow and dotted line) appeared and connected the west
end of F1 and the south end of F2 (Panel h). The newly formed bright threads
and faint loops were likely the product of magnetic reconnection.

The interactions between two ﬁlaments occurred intermittently at some times
in the following 20 hours, and two examples are shown in AIA 304, 171, 193,
94˚A (Figure 9 and Electronic Supplementary Material Animation 4). In each
example, the X-type structure (white arrows) and brightenings around ﬁlament
ends are clear evidence of magnetic reconnection between the two ﬁlaments.

Accompanying these successive interactions, two mini-ﬁlaments exhibited sig-
niﬁcant changes in their form. The morphology evolution of the two small ﬁl-
aments through a whole day is shown in Figure 10. The changes of ﬁlaments
are very clear in SMART Hα and AIA 304˚A (top and middle panels), and the
ﬁlament proﬁles (green and red lines) are superposed on HMI magnetograms
(bottom panels). Remarkably, F1 was initially very sheared in its eastern part,
and ﬁnally lessened in the shear during the evolution, and F2 rotated anti-
clockwise and became short. In addition, the angle (θ2) between the F1 eastern
part (green-dotted lines) and F2 (red-dotted lines) experienced two stages. Be-
fore the ﬁrst interaction of ﬁlaments, θ2 decreased from ≈45.3◦to ≈5.0◦(Panels

SOLA: sola_200430.tex; 2 August 2022; 0:57; p. 6

Formation and Immediate Deformation of a Small Filament

a – b). After the interactions, θ2 is roughly equal to the angle between F1 (the
green-dotted line) and F2, which increased to ≈116.1◦(Panel c). It is obvious
that both F1 and F2 deformed after the successive interactions.

4. Discussion and Conclusions

In this article, we report the formation and immediate deformation of a small
ﬁlament in AR 12760 on 28 – 30 April 2020. The ﬁlament formation in ≈40
hours was closely associated with the intermittent magnetic interactions between
three emerging dipoles and the pre-existing magnetic polarities. The emergence
of three dipoles added new magnetic energy for F1, and the separation motion
drove and guided the coalescing process of the basic threads (FT0, FT1, FT2
and FT3). The cancellation between the emerging negative polarities of dipoles
and previously-existing positive polarities led to the formation of the elongated
F1. Such a coalescence process is very like the ‘head-to-tail’ ﬂux linkage scenario
proposed by Martens and Zwaan (2001). Similar observations of the coalescence
formation process of large and small ﬁlaments can be seen in the work of Wang
and Muglach (2007) and Chen et al. (2020).

The newly-formed F1 quickly deformed the following day. The continuous
magnetic-ﬂux cancellation beneath the adjacent ends of the F1 and the nearby
F2 likely destabilized the F1 and F2 and thus intermittent magnetic interac-
tions occurred between them. Finally, F1 lessened in the shear, and F2 became
much shorter (Figure 10). Hence, the ﬁlament F1 experienced the formation and
immediate deformation through intermittent magnetic interactions.

Based on the observational results and discussion, we propose a possible sce-
nario of the formation of F1 with three main steps (Figure 11). In the ﬁrst step
(upper panels), there existed some ﬁlament threads (FT0) connecting P0a and
N0a, before the emergence of the ﬁlament threads (FT1) of the ﬁrst dipole (P1a-
N1a). The eastward N1a interacted with P0a (the yellow star), and magnetic
reconnection occurred between FT0 and FT1. As a result, the ﬁlament in the
ﬁrst phase (F1(cid:48)) formed and connected N0a and P1a, with a dip above the
interaction location between P0a and N1a. In the second step (middle panels),
N1a kept interacting with P0a and P0b, and N0a also interacted with P0a and
P0b (yellow stars). Besides, N1b of the second dipole also moved eastwards and
mixed with N1a, and P1b merged with P0c and P1a. Therefore, the eastern part
of the ﬁlament in the second phase (F(cid:48)(cid:48)) became convex. In the third step (bottom
panels), the emergence of the third dipole brought in the ﬁlament threads (FT3),
and eastward movement of N1c led to the interaction between N1c and P0b and
the magnetic reconnection between FT3 and F(cid:48)(cid:48) (the yellow star). Accompa-
nying with the convergence, an elongated ﬁlament (F1) ﬁnally formed through
intermittent magnetic interactions associated with the successive emergence of
three dipoles. In this discussion we simply focus on the main footpoints of the
ﬁlaments. As discussed by Chen, Xu, and Ding (2020), active-region ﬁlaments
generally have few or no other footpoints (i.e. barbs), and the ﬁlaments we
discuss here ﬁts that pattern.

The deformation process of F1 is shown in Figure 12. The eastern part of F1
was very sheared and close to the southern part of F2. Due to the continuous
magnetic-ﬂux cancellation beneath the adjacent ends of two ﬁlaments and the
convergence (black arrows) of the two ends of F2, magnetic interactions (yellow
star) intermittently occurred between the eastern part of F1 and F2 (Panel a). As
the production of magnetic reconnections, a longer loop (the red line) connected
the western end of F1 and the southern end of F2, and a short loop (the blue-
dotted line) linked the eastern end of F1 and the northern end of F2, which is
consistent with the newly formed occasional structures (pink and black arrows
in Figure 8). Finally, F1 lessened in the shear, and F2 became shorter (Panel b).
Obviously, there was a close relationship between the formation and defor-
mation of F1 and the continuous magnetic activities including the emergence,
cancellation, and convergence. However, the same types of magnetic activities
played diﬀerent roles in two stages of ﬁlament evolution. They led to a head-
to-tail reconnection of a pair of dipoles and are responsible for the development
of the elongated F1. It was a process that slowly accumulated magnetic energy
in the ﬁlament structure and made the ﬁlament stable, but it slowly disturbed
the two ﬁlaments in the deformation process and gradually released magnetic
energy by intermittent magnetic reconnections.

Moreover, it is generally believed that the eruption involved an accumulation
process of magnetic energy. When the stored magnetic energy reaches a certain
stage, loss of equilibrium occurs in the system accompanying with magnetic
reconnections, and the magnetic energy can be intensely released in the form of
an eruption (Chen, 2011). However, the energy accumulation process may not
always smoothly. Like the F1 in this case, it only experienced deformation, not
eruption, after intermittent magnetic reconnections. Hence, it is possible that the
stored energy in the ﬁlament might be dissipated by small-scale reconnection in
some cases and thus forestall the eruption. It is important to note this possibility.
In summary, we believe that the formation and immediate deformation of a
small ﬁlament was closely associated with its magnetic-ﬂux emergence, cancel-
lation, and convergence. We also suggest that the gradual release of magnetic
energy is an important factor if a ﬁlament is to only deform but not erupt. The
high resolution 1.8-meter Chinese Large Solar Telescope (CLST) captured only
one of the interaction processes, therefore continuous high-resolution observa-
tions of deformation process still needs to be studied. Other numerical methods
such as MHD simulation, or nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) methods should
be employed to measure the energy loss in the deformation process. More studies
are needed to understand the process of formation and deformation of ﬁlaments.
