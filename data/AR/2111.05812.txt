ABSTRACT

Waves and oscillations are important solar phenomena, not only because they can propagate and
dissipate energy in the chromosphere, but also because they carry information about the structure
of the atmosphere in which they propagate. The nature of the three-minute oscillations observed in
the umbral region of sunspots is considered to be an eﬀect of propagation of magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) waves upward from below the photosphere. We present a study of sunspot oscillations and
wave propagation in NOAA AR 12470 using an approximately one-hour long data set acquired on
2015 December 17 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Goode Solar
Telescope (GST) operating at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS). The ALMA data are unique in providing a time-series of direct temperature
measurements in the sunspot chromosphere. The two-second cadence of ALMA images allows us to
well resolve the three-minute periods typical of sunspot oscillations in the chromosphere. Fourier
analysis is applied to ALMA Band 3 (∼100 GHz, ∼3 mm) and GST Hα data sets to obtain power
spectra as well as oscillation phase information. We analysed properties of the wave propagation
by combining multiple wavelengths that probe physical parameters of solar atmosphere at diﬀerent
heights. We ﬁnd that the ALMA temperature ﬂuctuations are consistent with that expected for a
propagating acoustic wave, with a slight asymmetry indicating non-linear steepening.

1. INTRODUCTION

Sunspot oscillations are a frequently stud-
ied wave phenomenon in the solar atmo-
sphere. These oscillations are directly con-
nected with the propagation of solar magne-
tohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and may play

a role in coronal and chromospheric heating.
Moreover, they can also serve as a probe of
the structure of the solar atmosphere. Os-
cillations in sunspot umbrae (e.g., Beckers &
Tallant 1969; Beckers & Schultz 1972; Gio-
vanelli 1972) were reported shortly after the
discovery of p-mode oscillations. There are two
types of characteristic oscillations in sunspots,
the photospheric 5-minute oscillations driven
by the p-modes and 3-minute oscillations rep-

resenting the resonant mode of the sunspot
itself (Thomas 1981; Bogdan & Judge 2006;
Khomenko & Collados 2015).

Studies of sunspot oscillations have been car-
ried out by multiple instruments over the years,
including the Solar Optical Telescope onboard
Hinode (Nagashima et al. 2007), the Nobeyama
Radioheliograph (Reznikova et al. 2012), the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board SDO
(Reznikova et al. 2012; Sych & Nakariakov
2014), the Interface Region Imaging Spectro-
graph (Tian et al. 2014; Yurchyshyn et al.
2015), the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) op-
erating at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO)
(Maurya et al. 2013; Yurchyshyn et al. 2015; Su
et al. 2016) and other ground-based telescopes
(e.g., Centeno et al. 2006; L¨ohner-B¨ottcher et
al. 2016; Anan et al. 2019; Felipe et al. 2020).
The sunspot oscillations are a speciﬁc mani-
festation of the signiﬁcant amount of acoustic
energy generated through oscillatory motion in
near-surface layers. In the upper photosphere,
most of the upward propagating waves at lower
frequencies (below 5 mHz, or periods longer
than 3-4 minutes) are reﬂected back downward
while higher frequency waves continue to prop-
agate upward into the chromosphere. A vari-
ety of observations have revealed how energy is
deposited in the upper atmosphere due to such
wave motions. For example, a study by Rear-
don et al. (2008) using Ca II (854.2 nm) line
observations from the Interferometric Bidimen-
sional Spectrometer (IBIS) revealed the pres-
ence of a power-law distribution of signiﬁcant
oscillatory power up to 25 mHz, suggestive
of the widespread presence of turbulence from
shock dissipation in the chromosphere.

Waves also carry information about the struc-
ture of the atmosphere in which they propa-
gate. Since the sound speed is a function of
temperature in the chromosphere, pressure dis-
turbances with frequencies above the acoustic
cut-oﬀ frequency can provide direct informa-
tion about the atmosphere at diﬀerent heights
and the accompanying temperature and veloc-
ity perturbations.

Over many years, numerous eﬀorts have be-
ing made in studying the particular oscillatory
signals seen in sunspot umbrae. Using Hα ﬁl-
ters on the 12 inch solar telescope in Culgo-
ora, Giovanelli (1972) was the ﬁrst to measure
sunspot oscillations in Hα velocity. Later on,
more detail has been revealed using Hα line

wing data. Phillis (1975) showed the inten-
sity variation in red and blue wings of Hα at
±0.3˚A that demonstrate the line-of-sight ve-
locity ﬁeld as an oscillation on a upward ﬂow.
Uexkuell et al. (1983) compared the oscilla-
tions measured from several lines (Ca II, Na D1
and D2, Ni I, Hα) using power spectra analysis
and studied the phase relation between them.
With the high cadence ﬁltergrams from Univer-
sal Birefringent Filter on the Dunn Solar Tele-
scope (DST), Christopoulou et al. (2000, 2001)
studied the relation between running penum-
bra waves and umbral oscillations in diﬀerent
layers of the solar atmosphere marked by dif-
ferent lines from Hα line center and wings.
Tziotziou et al. (2007) studied multiple um-
bral ﬂashes in one sunspot using Ca II and Hα
intensity images and revealed the coexistence
of more than one oscillating mode, suggesting
diﬀerent physical conditions existing in the um-
bra.

However, studies of wave propagation in the
chromosphere are not straightforward. For ex-
ample, Mein & Mein (1976) and Fleck & Deub-
ner (1989) found no phase diﬀerence between
the Doppler shifts of the Ca II infrared triplet
lines at 854.2 nm and 849.8 nm, which are
formed at diﬀerent heights, and used this as
evidence of a non-propagating component in
the chromospheric wave ﬁeld. However, this
conclusion was questioned by Skartlien et al.
(1994), whose simulations of propagating dis-
turbances predicted little or no phase diﬀerence
between these lines, similar to the above obser-
vations, even though propagating shocks were
present. This shows that in interpreting obser-
vations it is necessary to consider the radiative
transfer eﬀects and the atmospheric structure
over the entire range of heights contributing to
the observed emissions.

Previous observations have shown the capa-
bility of detecting oscillations in sunspots using
radio instruments such as the Nobeyama Ra-
dio Observatory (Shibasaki 2001) and the Very
Large Array (Nindos et al. 2002). Loukitcheva
et al. (2004) has demonstrated the feasibility
of measuring chromospheric oscillations in the
mm range. Such observations have the dis-
tinct advantage of directly probing the plasma
temperature at diﬀerent heights in the solar
chromosphere depending on the observing fre-
quency.

Early research (Leibacher & Stein 1981;
Zhugzhda & Dzhalilov 1982; Zhugzhda 1984)
on the oscillations in the chromosphere sug-
gested that the oscillatory modes are produced
by a resonant cavity. However, in more re-
cent studies (Felipe et al. 2010; Chae & Goode
2015), a diﬀerent scenario has been proposed
that the 3 minutes oscillation is a direct indica-
tion of vertically propagating waves that travel
through the gravitationally stratiﬁed medium.
Despite the growing knowledge and complex-
ity of theoretical models, there remain several
open questions related with the fundamental
physical mechanisms in the sunspot region.

The need for better understanding of the
ﬁne structure of the 3 min oscillation and
its time evolution in sunspots has intensiﬁed
with the development of better observating
tools. Among modern observatories, the At-
acama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA) opens up a new era of solar radio ob-
servation due to its high spatial and temporal
resolution and image quality (e.g. Nindos et al.
2018; Molnar et al. 2019; Nindos et al. 2021).
When combined with other cutting-edge in-
struments, such as BBSO/GST, SDO/AIA and
IRIS, ALMA can provide unique electron tem-
perature diagnostics that clarify the behavior
of the solar chromosphere to propagating waves
(see Patsourakos et al. 2020; Nindos et al. 2021,
for a discussion of p-mode oscillations seen with
ALMA).

The aim of this paper is to present an analy-
sis of 3-minute oscillations in a sunspot umbra
using data gathered by multiple instruments
and demonstrate the presence of such oscil-
latory motion in ALMA Band 3 data. With
the help of high-cadence and high-resolution
ALMA data as well as the linear dependence
between ALMA image intensity and brightness
temperature of the plasma (Wedemeyer et al.
2016), we report some of the ﬁrst observations
of spatially resolved temperature oscillations in
a sunspot umbra.

2. OBSERVATIONS

We analysed the oscillation signal mea-
sured in the western part of active region
NOAA 12470 during one-hour observing pe-
riod (18:42 UT – 19:48 UT on 2015 December
17), which was part of an ALMA solar commis-
sioning campaign whose data are in the pub-
lic domain. The ALMA dataset we used was

provided by the ALMA observatory as part of
its Science Veriﬁcation data release. Previous
publications based on this ALMA data release
are Bastian et al. (2017), Iwai et al. (2017),
Loukitcheva et al. (2017), and Shimojo et al.
(2017). Only Shimojo et al. (2017) used data
from the same day (2015 December 17) as con-
sidered here, and that study was focused on a
small brightening rather than the sunspot it-
self. Our observations were conducted using
the band 3 receiver (centered at 100 GHz) in
a single-pointing (snap-shot) mode. Due to
the necessity of phase calibration, blocks of on-
target observations were run for approximately
615 s at a cadence of 2 s, followed by a 220-s oﬀ-
target phase calibrator scan, which resulted in
total of ﬁve solar scans to be analyzed. In this
paper, we will use designations t1, t2, t3, t4,
and t5 to represent each solar scan arranged in
time increase order. The ALMA antenna con-
ﬁguration consisted of total 31 antennas with
twenty two 12-m antennas and nine 7-m an-
tennas. The longest baseline of the antenna
conﬁguration was ∼300 m, which resulted in a
synthesized beam of 6.3(cid:48)(cid:48) × 2.3(cid:48)(cid:48) (Shimojo et
al. 2017).

We followed the general calibration method
of radio interferometry using the Common As-
tronomy Software Applications (CASA) pack-
age (Petry & CASA Development Team 2012)
to create images at 2 s cadence, and found that
the result is heavily inﬂuenced by phase errors
produced by the temporal and spatially vari-
able water content of the Earth’s atmosphere,
which can be severe enough to render sunspot
oscillations undetectable. In order to counter
this eﬀect, we carried out a self-calibration pro-
cess, which uses the solar signal itself to correct
for antenna-based phase and amplitude errors,
similar to a method by Shimojo et al. (2017).
The scheme of self-calibration can be de-
scribed as follows: a) split the data that have
been corrected using standard calibration into
10 min sub-datasets t1-t5 according to the scan
index. b) For each sub-dataset, make an im-
age from the entire 10-min period using the
CLEAN task in CASA, to use as a model for
self-calibration. The model is stored in the
dateset for later use. Atmospheric ﬂuctuations
will largely average out in such a long integra-
tion. c) Determine phase corrections for each
2-s time period relative to the model given
by step b using the gaincal task in CASA,

4

and generate a self-calibration table. d) Ap-
ply the phase corrections to each image in the
sub-dataset using the applycal task in CASA
and generate an intermediately corrected sub-
dataset. e) Iteratively repeat steps b-d, substi-
tuting in each intermediate sub-dataset, until
no further correction is needed, as determined
by checking the calibration table for reduction
of the residuals.

In our case, we applied this phase self-
calibration cycle four times, resulting in ﬁ-
nal residual phase ﬂuctuations of around 10
degrees standard deviation. We applied the
scheme to each of the measured 10-min sub-
datasets to complete the self-calibration pro-
cedure. The result shows a clear improve-
ment in removing the ﬂuctuations caused by
the Earth’s atmosphere and allows the regu-
lar variations due to sunspot oscillations to be
measured.

The smallest spatial scale of the antenna con-
ﬁguration is roughly 70(cid:48)(cid:48), which is not suﬃ-
cient to measure the solar background bright-
ness temperature over the band 3 ﬁeld of view
(FOV; ∼80(cid:48)(cid:48) in Figure 1). To overcome this
drawback, the single-dish observations of the
full Sun were taken using three other anten-
nas to measure the overall emission close in
time to when ALMA was observing the tar-
get (White et al. 2017). The information from
both interferometer and single-dish antennas
then were combined using the “feathering” pro-
cess in CASA to obtain the true temperature
scale on the full-range of spatial scales. The left
panel of Figure 1 shows the end result of this
full process, which has a pixel scale of 0.3(cid:48)(cid:48) and
FOV as deﬁned by the interferometer images.
The ﬁeld of view is truncated at the 20% level
of the peak response of the primary (single-
dish) beam and has been corrected for the de-
clining antenna response, which becomes more
extreme near the edges.

Due to the fact that ALMA is using the equa-
torial coordinate system (RA-Dec) as the out-
put framework for its data sets, as part of the
image processing we performed a coordinate
transformation to heliocentric coordinates, to
align the ALMA images with those from other
solar instruments. In this procedure, the center
of the ﬁeld of view (FOV) of each solar image
in one scan was transformed based on the he-
liocentric coordinates at the mid-time of the
scan to align all of the images to a ﬁxed time.

A time dependent rotation was applied to take
into account the rotation between these two
frames, leaving the images aligned with solar
north.

GST Hα image in the right panel. (b) GST Hα
near blue wing (-0.4 ˚A) image with the same HMI

To compare the ALMA images with those at
other wavelengths, we obtained the UV and
EUV intensity data cube from the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (Lemen et al.
2012) in the bandpass of 171 ˚A (Fe IX: the
quiet corona) and 304˚A (He II: the chromo-
sphere and transition region). The time ca-
dence of these two data sets is 12 s and the pixel
resolution is 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48). The duration of the AIA
data we used covers the full ALMA solar ob-
servation from 18:42 UT to 19:48 UT. Images
of both wavelengths were extracted from the
full-disk data to ﬁt the FOV of ALMA and the
center coordinates of these images were shifted
to correct for solar rotation. The continuum
intensity data product from by the Helioseis-
mic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on SDO was
used for alignment of between the SDO and
GST images.

The Goode Solar Telescope (GST) operat-
ing at BBSO (Cao et al. 2010) observed this
AR nearly simultaneously with ALMA (from
18:50 UT to 20:59 UT) at Hα line-center and
oﬀ-band wavelengths (±0.4 ˚A and ±0.8 ˚A) us-
ing the Visible Imaging Spectrograph (VIS) in-
strument. The spatial scale of the GST Hα im-
ages is 0.034(cid:48)(cid:48) per pixel, the VIS bandwidth is
0.08 ˚A, and the time cadence was 40 s. Speckle
reconstruction is normally performed by tak-
ing 100 frames in rapid succession and apply-

ing the algorithm to obtain a single sharper
image. However, this algorithm can produce
occasional glitches in low-light regions such as
sunspot umbrae, which are the focus of our

needed for large-scale features of umbral oscil-
lations, the unreconstructed Hα images were
used. The GST observations cover the entire
ALMA observing period t2–t5 but are missing
the ﬁrst few minutes during t1 set. Since our
interest is on the joint ALMA-GST coverage,
we mainly focus on analysing the t2–t5 ALMA
sub-datasets.

We also used the slit-jaw images in Mg II k
band (2796 ˚A) from the Interface Region Imag-
ing Spectrograph (IRIS) which is formed in the
chromosphere (De Pontieu et al. 2014) as a
comparison to the ALMA temperature oscilla-
tion. IRIS started observations during t3 and
suﬀered some cosmic-ray noise during the ﬁrst
10 minutes, which can be seen later in the time-
distance plots.

3. ANALYSIS

To visualize the oscillatory motion in the
sunspot in various wavelengths, we show in
Figure 2 time-distance plots along a line (Fig-
ure 2h) that crosses both umbra and penum-
bra. The double solid lines in Figure 2h mark
the width of the slit over which the data are
summed, with an ALMA map for reference,
overlaid with HMI contours that mark the
boundaries of the umbra and penumbra. The
time-distance plots were constructed for each
wavelength after co-alignment, as shown in the
other panels of Figure 2. The y coordinate in
each plot corresponds to the y coordinate of
the center of the slit in Figure 2h. Note that
the plots are marked with the y coordinate, not
distance along the slit. Multiply the y coordi-
2 for this roughly 45◦ slit to convert
nate by
to distance.

The horizontal black lines in each panel mark
the extent of the umbra. The ALMA data
for t1-t5 are in Figure 2a, with gaps indicat-
ing times of no data due to calibrations. GST

jaw data are shown in Figure 2c. AIA 304 ˚A
and 171 ˚A data are shown in Figs 2e,f. Non-
uniform chevron-shaped features (Kobanov et
al. 2006) that tilt in the same direction can be
seen in Figs 2b–g, suggesting an outward prop-

5

agation towards the penumbra. The 3-minute
oscillatory motion in these wavelengths also ex-
tends somehow into the penumbra (above or
below the solid black lines in Figure 2a–g), but
with some merging and increased separation to
match the penumbral 5-minute oscillation pe-
riod. This signature of propagation seems to
be far less apparent in the ALMA data, and
the oscillatory signature is only prominent in
the umbra.

Our discovery of umbral oscillation in ALMA
band 3 is groundbreaking in many respects.
ALMA data provide a unique probe of tem-
perature changes in the solar atmosphere in a
relatively thin layer where the opacity is near
unity (Loukitcheva et al. 2015). It is of interest
to compare these oscillations in temperature
with intensity oscillations provided by other
instruments that probe diﬀerent layers of so-
lar atmosphere. Figure 3 compares the light
curves obtained from a cut at x = −251.0(cid:48)(cid:48),
y = 222.5(cid:48)(cid:48) in the time-distance plot (Figure 2)
for multiple instruments. The location of the
cut was chosen based on the wave patterns in
all wavelengths shown in Figure 2 so that it
covers the region of strongest oscillations. The
data have been arbitrarily scaled and oﬀset for
better comparison. Though separated by gaps,
we can still see some correspondence between
light curves of diﬀerent wavelengths, which en-
able the calculation of phase relations that will
be discussed later.

In order to study the oscillation power, we
applied the Fourier power spectrum for each
pixel in both the ALMA map and GST image
time series. Although the temporal resolution
of ALMA (2 s) and GST (∼40 s) data are quite
diﬀerent, they both contain suﬃcient samples
to resolve 3-minute oscillations and therefore
can be used to measure the 3-minute oscilla-
tion power. The power spectrum was calcu-
lated as follows. For each ALMA (10-minute)
solar scan, a map cube structure was made ac-
cording to the method described above so the
time series of each pixel can be easily obtained.
The GST data were selected based on start
and end time of each ALMA solar scan and
made into map cube as well. Inspired by the
method used in Ireland et al. (2015), the time
series of each pixel in the ALMA and GST
data cubes were obtained and normalized by
(I(t)) − (cid:104)I(t)(cid:105))/(cid:104)I(t)(cid:105), where I(t) is the vary-
ing brightness temperature for ALMA or vary-

over each 10-minute ALMA scan.

A Hanning window was applied to the nor-
malized time series to minimize edge eﬀects.
The full spatial resolution was retained during
the process in order to reach the ﬁnest possible
detail on the distribution of frequency-related
physical contents as a function of location. We
then applied the Fourier transform to the pro-
cessed time series to form the power spectrum
from each pixel. Figure 4 shows examples from
three pixels in both the ALMA and GST Hα
near blue wing (-0.4 ˚A) data cubes for time
t2, one in the region of umbral oscillations, one
in the penumbra, and one in the surrounding
quiet Sun. No GST power spectrum could be
obtained for the quiet Sun due to limited spa-
tial coverage (see Figure 1b).

The diﬀerences in shape among these power
spectra are consistent with what was seen in
the ALMA time-distance plot in Figure 2a.
The 3-minute band of the power spectra, which
is the two closest bins to 0.0056 Hz marked
with red dot-dashed lines, is especially strong
for the umbral power spectrum. From Figure 4,
we see that the peak of the umbral power spec-
trum is one to two magnitudes larger than the
others in both data sets. The umbral spectrum
of ALMA data also shows some evidence for
harmonics near 0.015 Hz, which strongly sug-
gests that the oscillation deviates from a sinu-

soid, as we demonstrate later. The frequency
distribution of power is similar for the penum-
bra and quiet Sun.

To characterize the power spectrum spatial
distribution, for each pixel we calculated the
integrated power in the 3-minute band marked
with the red dash-dot lines in Figure 4. This
procedure was carried out for each 10-minute
ALMA scan t2 to t5. The result for t2 is
shown in Figure 5, where the 3-minute oscilla-
tion power is shown with red contours. Blue
contours outline the umbral and penumbral
boundary as seen in the HMI continuum im-
age in panel (a).

We ﬁnd that the strong 3-minute oscillation
power falls solely inside the umbral boundary.
The oscillations seem to be strongest in the
western part of the umbra, while in the eastern
region separated by a small light bridge struc-
ture, the 3-minute oscillations are present but
weaker. This conclusion may be aﬀected by the
declining ALMA sensitivity at the edge of the
primary beam, however.

To further compare the power spectra in dif-
ferent regions, we calculated the mean power
for each frequency bin using all the pixels in
the umbra, penumbra and quiet Sun to create
the averaged power spectrum of ALMA t2 data
for each region. A combination of two power-
law functions, af b + cf d, was used in ﬁtting
the power-law tail starting from the frequency

eraged penumbral power spectrum was over-
plotted using red lines on the umbral and quiet
spectra for inter-comparison. The steeper slope
shown in panel (b) by the blue dashed line re-
veals the inﬂuence of the high 3-minute power

the same above 0.03 Hz (panel b), while the
quiet Sun spectrum in panel (d) shows a no-
table excess near 0.03 Hz that contributes to
a shallower and extended low-frequency slope.
A red-noise spectrum above about 0.07 Hz is
the same for all three regions, and may reﬂect
residual ﬂuctuations due to the Earth’s atmo-
sphere that have not been removed by the self-
calibration procedure. Note that although the
5-minute oscillations cannot be well-resolved
in the frequency domain, there is no sign of
a peak near 0.0033 Hz in the penumbral spec-
trum of Figure 5c, which further conﬁrms what
we learned from the time-distance plots—that

the penumbral 5-minute oscillations seen in Hα
(Figure 2b,d) are not apparent in the ALMA
band 3 data (Figure 2a).

Figure 6 shows the distribution of 3-min os-
cillation power in the t2 to t5 time ranges
(columns) and all bands from ALMA and GST
(rows). The rows represent the spatial evo-
lution of the 3-min power for the wavelength
band marked in the ﬁrst column. The sunspot
umbra is outlined in blue (see Figure 5) while
the black contours with gray shading show the
3-min power maps of each data set. For a given
band, the contour levels were set to be the same
for t2 to t5, which are 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 per-
cent of the maximum value of oscillation power
over the four power maps.

From Figure 6 we see that the shape of GST
Hα far red wing (+0.8˚A) 3-min power map
contours is less organized and weaker than the
others. While the other contours are gener-
ally constrained to lie well within the umbra,
the power in the Hα far-red wing mainly lies
along the umbral boundary. The relative am-
plitude of the +0.8˚A power is also 5-50 times
lower than in other bands, and hence we do not
include it in our subsequent analysis.

through the points showing the cubic spline in-
terpolation to the ALMA cadence.

To better reveal the phase relationships
among the diﬀerent bands shown in Figure 7,
we show ﬁve vertical dashed lines in the left
column T3 panel that indicate the peak posi-
tions of the ﬁve light curves for one particu-
lar oscillation. The colors match the colors of
light curves for the corresponding wavelengths.
These dashed lines reveal a general sequence of
the phase relationship, with Hα far blue wing
(-0.8 ˚A or -0.08 nm) peaking ﬁrst, then in or-
der of peak time the Hα near blue wing (-0.4
˚A), ALMA band 3 (100 GHz or 3.0 mm), Hα
center line and Hα near red wing (+0.4 ˚A). We
calculate the delay times based on these peak
positions, relative to the Hα far blue wing to be
14 s, 32 s, 64 s and 82 s. This timing pattern
is followed remarkably faithfully in the other
individual oscillations in the left column, with
similar time lags. Since the locations of the
sample point in the umbra change in the diﬀer-
ent periods t2 to t5, the relatively stable phase
shift between these bands suggests that it is
a characteristic of the propagating waves that
should be accounted for in any physical inter-
pretation.

We also compared the light curves from the
strong 3-min oscillation region in the left col-
umn with the ones from a nearby, relatively
quiet umbral region (green plus symbols in each
panel of Figure 6) in the right column for t2-t5.
Unlike the case for the peak oscillation region,
where the location is diﬀerent for each time
window, the quiet region selection is ﬁxed for
all of the time windows. For each time win-
dow, the amplitude range was scaled to match
the left column to show the diﬀerence between
these two regions. One can see that for t2, t4,
and t5 ALMA temperature oscillations are not
apparent when compared to the high-power re-
gion, although velocity ﬂuctuations in the Hα
bands still persist at a reduced level.
In t3
the ALMA oscillations do appear in the quiet
region, again at a reduced level. The signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerences in oscillatory power across the
umbra, both in temperature and velocity di-
agnostics, indicate rapid spatial and temporal
modiﬁcation of the wave propagation charac-
teristics.

In order to study the general phase relation-
ships among all bands in the strong 3-min os-
cillation region, we performed an epoch analy-

regions. (a) HMI continuum image at 19:02 UT,
overlaid with red contours showing the 3-min oscil-

gion. (d) the same as (b) for quiet Sun. The av-
eraged penumbra power spectrum in panel (c) is
over-plotted in red in both (b) and (d).

For the remaining bands, the 3-min power
was in all cases strongest and most concen-
trated in t2 and reduced to 20-40% of that
value in t3 to t5. Although it is diﬃcult to tell
from the shape and location of these contours,
which suﬀer from the limited cadence of the Hα
data, the overall pattern is consistent with the
often seen appearance of new centers of oscil-
lation power plus the lateral spreading of wave
energy from previous centers (Yurchyshyn et
al. 2020).

To determine the phase relationships among
ALMA band 3 and GST Hα sub-bands, we plot
in Figure 7 the light curves from these wave-
lengths taken in a region of high oscillation
power (red plus symbol in Figure 6) and for
comparison a neighboring region of low power
(green plus symbol in Figure 6). The selected
locations for the high power sample are dif-
ferent from t2 to t5, but within each given
time block, the same position is used for every
wavelength. The ALMA 2-s cadence data are
plotted directly (black curve), while the lower-
cadence Hα measurements are plotted in dif-
ferent symbols and colors, with the solid curves

comparison the Hα data have been temporally interpolated and spatially smoothed to match the ALMA
resolution. The contours in ALMA and the Hα sub-band images represent 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 percent of
the peak value of the 3-min oscillation power in each wavelength. Red and green plus symbols mark regions
of high and low power, respectively, whose light curves are plotted in Figure 7.

terms of their phase relative to the peak of the
Hα far blue wing (−0.8 ˚A). This was done for
individual time windows t2 to t5 in the left col-
umn of Figure 8, with solid, dashed, and dotted
lines for the ﬁrst, second, and third oscillations
in each time window, respectively, and for all
time windows in the right column. The oscilla-
tions in diﬀerent wavelengths were oﬀset verti-
cally for clarity, and the ALMA light curve was
moved to the middle position to reﬂect its or-
dering of peak time midway between Hα near
blue wing (−0.4 ˚A, cyan) and Hα center line
(yellow).

The left column of Figure 8 shows that the os-
cillations in t2 are highly coherent for both the
ALMA and GST data, reﬂecting the stronger
oscillation power during that time window.
The peak of the ﬁrst wave (solid line) in each
band in t2 is marked with a symbol to show
the progression in phase of the peaks similar to
the vertical dashed lines in Figure 7. The right
panel of Figure 8, overlaying the curves from all
the time blocks, shows that this general pattern
persists for all of the oscillations although there
is higher variability in some bands. The Hα
near blue wing and ALMA oscillations are par-
ticularly coherent for most of the oscillations,

and there is a marked tendency for the drop in
ALMA brightness (corresponding to tempera-
ture) to be steeper than its rise.

4. DISCUSSION

In order to put the oscillations in tempera-
ture detected by ALMA into context with the
wavelength-dependent brightness variations in
the Hα line, and thus account for the phase
shifts in Figures 7 and 8, a quantitative so-
lar atmospheric model that exempliﬁes the
sunspot structure is needed. Inspired by Mol-

nar et al. (2019), we used the RH code (Ry-
bicki & Hummer 1991, 1992; Uitenbroek 2000)
to synthesize the chromospheric radiation in
1D, which uses the Solar Irradiance Physical
Modeling (SRPM) as an input for the calcu-
lation (Fontenla et al. 2011). Due to the es-
timated formation height of ALMA band 3
(Loukitcheva et al. 2015), we used a sunspot
umbral model (model S) that focuses on the
photosphere and chromosphere (model index
1006). The RH code solves combined equa-
tions of statistical equilibrium and radiation

transfer for multi-level atoms and molecules
under certain input parameters. The simula-
tion was carried out with non-LTE setup for 6-
levels of hydrogen atom (levels 0 to 5, plus the
continuum), while other atomic species were
treated with the LTE assumption. In addition
to the default Hα output wavelength grid, we
also used the RH code to produce the radiative
emission in the wavelength range from 2.6 mm
to 3.4 mm corresponding to the ALMA band 3
observations.

The results from the RH simulation of the
umbra model are shown in Figure 9 for both
wavelength ranges. The contribution functions
are illustrated in the underlying gray scale map
while the emergent intensities are plotted in vi-
olet lines. The Hα center line position was set
to zero, and four dashed vertical lines indicate
the sub-bands used in our study. From this
result, we can see that the contribution func-
tion for Hα extends over a wide height range
as seen on the left panel. The major part of
the center line intensity comes from a narrow
layer in the middle chromosphere (∼ 1100 km)
while the continuum is mainly formed in the
photosphere. In the ALMA band 3 wavelength
range, the formation height seen in the right
panel is extended between 600 km and 1000
km in the chromosphere. Combined with the
phase pattern indicated by the dashed vertical
lines in Figure 7, we can conclude that the Hα
line wing signatures are most likely dominated
by the velocity of the waves, as observed by
Phillis (1975).

To better understand the inﬂuence of the os-
cillation on the Hα line proﬁle, we use the ﬁrst
complete oscillation in the t2 light curves to
ﬁt dynamic Hα line proﬁles. Because no pho-
tometric calibration is available for the GST
data, we instead use the normalized values
from each Hα sub-band light curve in the top-
left panel of Figure 8 to calculate the rela-
tive variations at these four sub-bands at any
given time.
In this process, we assume that
the line proﬁle at Hα oﬀ-center bands can not
exceed the continuum, so the light curves are
obtained relative to the maximum values at
these wavelengths. For the line center the rela-
tive variation is based on the mean value of its
light curve. To anchor the continuum for the
ﬁts, two far oﬀ-center wavelengths (+/- 3 ˚A)
were added to represent the continuum value,
we then applied Gaussian ﬁtting to these six

13

points to form an interpolated line proﬁle for
a given time. To further stabilize the ﬁts, only
line width and line center position were allowed
to change during the Gaussian ﬁtting.

The result is shown in Figure 10. Each color
in the color bar represents one of the vertical
dashed lines in the top left panel of Figure 8,
with numbers showing the order in time. The
original simulation result from the RH code
is also plotted with a dashed line in the ﬁg-
ure, and is used to provide the intensity scale
shown on the vertical axis. From the color-
coded time bins in the ﬁgure we can form a
schematic picture of how the Hα line proﬁle
changed with time/oscillation phase—it starts
near the original dashed line proﬁle, shifts to
longer wavelengths (blue curves), then rapidly
shifts to shorter wavelengths (green), and ﬁ-
nally moves back to the center (red).

Although these ﬁts are approximate, the be-
havior of the resulting line full-width half-
maximum (FWHM) and line shift (Doppler ve-
locity) shown in Figure 11 are suggestive. In
the upper panel of Figure 11, we plot the tem-
perature oscillation from ALMA alongside the
line width information generated by the Gaus-
sian ﬁtting. Note that the line width varies
in phase with the temperature variations mea-
sured by ALMA, with the greatest width cor-
responding to the highest temperature. This
is consistent with the ﬁnding by Molnar et al.
(2019) that ALMA temperature is correlated
with Hα line width.

The lower panel of Figure 11 shows the
Doppler velocity. The positive Doppler shift
corresponds to the upward propagating waves.
The maximum downward Doppler velocity am-
plitude is 3.4 km/s while the maximum upward
velocity is 3.9 km/s. The asymmetric Doppler
velocity proﬁle reveals that the plasma moves
downward slowly with a steady acceleration
and then suddenly changes its direction and
moves upward with a much larger acceleration,
creating a steep rise in the velocity diagram.

The clear signature of a sawtooth pattern
in the Doppler velocity for this particular os-
cillation, which is the largest amplitude one
in our observations, has to be taken with
some caution due to the relatively low cadence
(∼40 s) and small number of wavelengths (4)
on which it is based. Even so, we ﬁnd that
both the Doppler velocity magnitude and trend
in Figure 11 agree well with those reported by

let line in Figure 9 left panel), while each colored
line represents Gaussian ﬁtting to the four Hα line
intensities at 10 times (marked with 10 vertical
dashed lines in Figure 8). The color bar indicates
the time bin. For these ﬁts we kept the continuum
and line-core intensities ﬁxed and ﬁt only line shift
and line width. The error bars plotted for the ﬁrst
Gaussian ﬁt were calculated based on the standard
deviation of the light curves in the nearby quiet re-
gion for each of the four Hα sub-bands.

Tziotziou et al. (2006) and Chae & Litvinenko
(2017). This asymmetrical Doppler velocity
trend continues in observations of transition
region lines (Tian et al. 2014), with a higher
velocity of order 10 km s−1. Such asymmetries
are evidence of steepening or shock behavior in
the atmosphere of sunspot umbrae, which was

discovered in the Doppler shift of Ca II (Lites
1984) as well as He I (Lites 1986). In any case,
the asymmetry in the ALMA temperature be-
havior (slow rise in temperature followed by a
faster fall) is clearly established by our obser-
vations with 2-s cadence, as seen in each of the

individual oscillations in Figure 7 and in the
right panel of Figure 8.

The ALMA temperature variation—its mag-
nitude, phase relative to Hα Doppler veloc-
ity, and its asymmetric shape—all provide new
information on the phenomenon of umbral 3-
min oscillations. We have investigated whether
these observations can be explained by current
theories of acoustic wave propagation by per-
forming a simulation from the model of Chae &
Goode (2015). We compare the results of our
simulations from their model with the observa-
tions, as shown in Figure 12. In brief outline,
the steps we took to produce Figure 12b are (i)
implementing their model in Python, (ii) using
it to calculate the atmospheric parameter per-
turbations (velocity v, number density pertur-
bation dne, and temperature perturbation dT )
as a function of height and time, (iii) modi-
fying the FAL umbral model by adding these
perturbations as fractional changes at multi-
ple time steps, and (iv) running the RH code
at these multiple time steps to simulate the
Hα line proﬁle and ALMA brightness temper-
ature. The good agreement of the phase dif-
ferences between the observations (Figure 12a)
and simulations (Figure 12b) suggest that the
ALMA temperature variations are mainly a
consequence of an upward propagating acous-
tic wave in the stratiﬁed medium of the sunspot
umbra.

Similar to Figure 10, we plotted the temper-
ature proﬁle based on the simulated emergent
intensity in band 3 wavelengths from the RH
code at the 10 phases marked in Figure 12b.
The colors from blue to red indicate increasing
phase (or time), as shown in the color bar. The
temperature proﬁle starts at the lowest tem-
perature, rises to the peak, and then falls back.
The rapid line shift that happens between time
bins 4 to 7 in Figure 10 corresponds to the
temperature peak in Figure 13, but the ear-
lier peak in the observations (Figure 12a) rela-
tive to the linear model (Figure 12b) suggests
a tendency for the chromosphere to be heated
more strongly at this time than described by
the linear theory. The absolute temperature
and temperature ﬂuctuation predicted by the
RH code, about 8700 K and ±1100 K, respec-
tively at 3 mm, are both somewhat higher than
the observations (Figure 7), which are around
8000 K and ±500 K. See Loukitcheva et al.
(2017) for a detailed comparison of the bright-

chromosphere.

5. CONCLUSIONS

16

Our study describes the ﬁrst observations of
sunspot oscillations detected by ALMA. The
ALMA observations provide unique measure-
ments of the chromospheric temperature vari-
ation tied to electron temperature via free-
free emission, and so is relatively insensitive to
atomic abundances and local non-equilibrium
conditions.

We applied Fourier analysis to the ALMA
band 3 data to create spatial maps of the 3-
min power amplitude. The 3-min power maps
correlate well to similar maps for all Hα sub-
bands except the far red wing (+0.8 ˚A) where
the 3-min oscillation signal is weak. From the
light curves in Figures 7 and 8, we discovered
a relatively constant phase relationship among
Hα sub-band intensity and ALMA tempera-
ture as well as evidence for a sawtooth pattern
in the ALMA temperature variation, albeit less
abrupt than the velocity transition seen in Hα.
The phase relationship among the diﬀerent Hα
bands sampling diﬀerent parts of the line pro-
ﬁle is consistent with a shift of the line cen-
ter during the oscillation as well as a slight
variation in line width. The ALMA tempera-
ture and the Hα line width peak at around the
same time, but the ALMA temperature shows
a more rapid fall after the peak time.

We used RH code to simulate the Hα line pro-
ﬁle and the expected ALMA emission based on
the FAL S sunspot atmosphere model. The re-
sults are generally in agreement with observa-
tions although the ALMA band 3 brightness
temperature predicted by the FAL S model
(8700 K) is some 9% greater than observed
(8000 K). In order to understand the phase re-
lationship of the observed ALMA temperature
variation, we used the linear theory of Chae
& Goode (2015) for the propagation of a hy-
drodynamic disturbance in a simpliﬁed solar
atmosphere to obtain the velocity, density, and
pressure perturbations as a function of height,
then applied those perturbations to the FAL
S model. Calculations of the Hα and ALMA
emission using repeated runs of the RH code for
diﬀerent times during one oscillation of such a
disturbance gave results that are in reasonable
agreement with the model. In particular, the
calculated relative phase relationships among
the Hα near blue wing intensity, ALMA band
3 temperature, and Hα near red wing intensity
are close to those observed, showing that the
ALMA temperature variations are largely due

to atmospheric heating expected for a propa-
gating disturbance.

The symmetric temperature variation from
the model
is due to the linear theory used
for wave propagation in Chae & Goode (2015)
which cannot reproduce the slight sawtooth
pattern observed in both the ALMA band 3
temperatures and Hα Doppler velocity, there-
fore a study of the non-linear solution for the
wave function is much needed. Based on pre-
vious research (Litvinenko & Chae 2017; Chae
& Litvinenko 2017), the non-linear eﬀect can
provide not only a physics scenario of the wave-
front steepening and shock formation that is
related with the sawtooth pattern, but also
an explanation for the 2nd harmonic seen in
the umbra power spectrum in Figure 4. We
also note that the RH code gives an Hα line
width for the FAL S model that is signiﬁcantly
narrower than commonly observed (Fricke &
Els¨asser 1965; Wallace et al. 2005). We have
done a preliminary study of other models (e.g.
the FAL penumbral model R and the Maltby
model (Maltby et al. 1986), which can correct
the Hα line-width discrepancy but results in es-
timated ALMA temperatures (and heights of
formation) that are much too high. Here we
simply note the discrepancy—a more thorough
investigation will be addressed in a future pa-
per now in preparation.

These new observations show the power
of ALMA mm-wave observations for provid-
ing entirely new diagnostics of the solar at-
mosphere.
Because of the low solar ac-
tivity since these science-veriﬁcation observa-
tions were made, no additional observations of
sunspot umbrae have been possible to date.
However, advances in ALMA capabilities for
solar observations, such as higher spatial res-
olution, polarization, and additional frequency
bands that provide diagnostics at both lower
and higher heights, all oﬀer great promise for
investigations in the near future as solar activ-
ity returns. Such observations should motivate
more sophisticated modeling that includes the
eﬀect of the hydrodynamic waves on ionization
states as well as the eﬀect of the strong sunspot
magnetic ﬁelds.
