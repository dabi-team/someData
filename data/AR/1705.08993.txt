Fabrication of sub-micron Josephson junctions is demonstrated using standard processing tech-
niques for high-coherence, superconducting qubits. These junctions are made in two separate lithog-
raphy steps with normal-angle evaporation. Most signiﬁcantly, this work demonstrates that it is
possible to achieve high coherence with junctions formed on aluminum surfaces cleaned in situ
with Ar milling before the junction oxidation. This method eliminates the angle-dependent shadow
masks typically used for small junctions. Therefore, this is conducive to the implementation of
typical methods for improving margins and yield using conventional CMOS processing. The cur-
rent method uses electron-beam lithography and an additive process to deﬁne the top and bottom
electrodes. Extension of this work to optical lithography and subtractive processes is discussed.

Superconducting devices implemented as quantum bits
(qubits) are among the leading candidates for building
quantum computers. Key elements in all types of su-
perconducting qubits are Josephson junctions, which are
the non-linear elements in the superconducting circuitry.
This non-linearity separates the two lowest energy levels
from higher excitations, forming a two-level system as
the physical qubit. Coherence times of superconducting
qubits have been increased signiﬁcantly in both 2D and
3D geometries (∼10-100µs) [1–5]. These relatively long
coherence times, combined with fast, high-ﬁdelity gate
schemes, have enabled the demonstration of quantum er-
ror detection with superconducting devices [6–8].

While the design and fabrication for various other ele-
ments that form quantum circuits, i.e., resonators, shunt
capacitors, and inductors, have been well studied and
brought into line with standard cleanroom techniques,
the preparation of the non-linear Josephson junction is
still typically conducted separately on a device-by-device
basis. In general, low participation ratios from both the
Josephson junction and it’s immediate surroundings are
essential to the success of present-day superconducting
qubits [4, 9]. This goal is typically achieved by shrink-
ing the junction size. These low-loss junctions have pre-
dominantly been fabricated using a multi-angle shadow-
evaporation (SE) technique, because it naturally yields
small structures in a single step process and works well
enough for demonstrations of small-scale circuits [10, 11].
SE is also convenient in that the oxidation of the base
electrode is conducted in-situ on the as-deposited ﬁlm
and, then immediately covered by the top electrode.

To satisfy the requirement of scalability of quantum
circuits, it is becoming critical to bring the junction fab-
rication step in line with standard fabrication techniques.
This is diﬃcult with the angle-dependence of the SE tech-
nique because it limits the wafer size for preparing junc-
tions with tight margins. One possible avenue is to use
[12], where the two
overlap junctions, as shown in Ref.

electrodes of Josephson junctions are prepared in sep-
arate steps. The coherence time from Ref. [12] is pre-
dominately limited by its lossy shunt capacitor and the
relatively large junction. Therefore the intrinsic loss of
junctions made with the overlap technique could not be
evaluated. In this paper, we describe the fabrication of
an overlap-junction, concentric-transmon qubit [13] that
exhibits long coherence times.

Details of the process to form the Al/AlOx/Al tun-
nel junction are illustrated in Fig. 1. Due to the small
size of the junction (∼100 nm), we used a standard
PMMA/Copolymer (50 nm/100 nm) bilayer resist and
electron-beam lithography to pattern the overlap junc-
tions. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the base electrode is pre-
pared by evaporating Al (∼ 20 nm thickness) from an
electron-beam deposition source. After taking the sam-
ple out of the vacuum chamber, a native oxide forms im-
mediately on the surface of the Al [Fig. 1(b)]. A second
lithography is performed to deﬁne the top electrode be-
fore the sample is loaded into the evaporator again. The
tunnel barrier is formed by making use of an argon RF-
plasma cleaning step (50 W, 10 mTorr) followed by room
temperature oxidation of the base electrode. During this
step, we ﬁx the oxidation pressure at 150 mTorr for a
short amount of time, typically ∼1-5 minutes. Notably,
this oxidation time is an order of magnitude shorter than
the oxidation time used in the SE technique, of which ox-
idation happens on fresh deposited Al. This is presum-
ably because the Ar RF plasma not only etches away the
native oxide formed on the Al surface, but also rough-
ens the Al surface, hence increasing the rate of oxida-
tion. Finally, the top Al electrode (∼ 40 nm thickness)
is deposited, depicted in Fig. 1(e). Figure 1(f) shows a
complete overlap junction after the metal-liftoﬀ process.

We measure the room-temperature resistance Rn of the
junctions made with this method and ﬁnd that the rela-
tions between Rn, oxidation time tox and junction area A
follow the empirical formula (Eq.1), which is consistent

From our measurements, we ﬁnd this relation holds
well for junction sizes greater than 0.01 µm2. We believe
this lower limit on junction size is due to the process bias
of the speciﬁc resist used and can be easily mitigated.
More importantly, because our method uses normal-angle
evaporation, high junction uniformity across a larger area
can be achieved. For example, substrate rotation can be
implemented during the evaporation to achieve ﬁlm ho-
mogeneity, which is a standard technique used through-
out the industry. This overlap method can also be modi-
ﬁed for compatibility into a standard processing ﬂow. For
example, a subtractive process will yield similar struc-
tures given that the top and bottom electrodes are grown,
deﬁned, and patterned using sputter deposition, optical
lithography, and etching, respectively. Smaller dimen-
sions can also be achieved via etching, while some extra
attention will be required to avoid redepostion on the
edges of the junction, a standard technique in magnetic
tunnel junction fabrication [15].

To form the large-scale features of our device, such as
the resonator and shunt capacitor of the transmon qubit,
we use thin-ﬁlm NbTiN ( 35 nm). The NbTiN is grown
at 500◦C with reactive sputter deposition and exhibits
low loss [16, 17]. A reactive ion etch with SF6 is used to
pattern our device, except in the junction area, as shown

in Fig. 2(b). The NbTiN in the junction area is removed
using a wet etch because it does not attack Si, leaving
a smooth surface for patterning the overlap junctions.
The chemical used in this wet etch is NH3OH/H2O2/H2O
(1:2:5) and the solution needs to be heated above 60C for
this etching process.

The concentric transmon design was chosen as a test
qubit because of low radiation loss [13]. The qubit con-
sists of a single overlap junction shunted by a circular
capacitor. Unlike the original design, there is a slit in
the outer ring to avoid ﬂux trapping. Figures 2(a) and
2(b) show the schematic of our measurement setup and
images of our device. The qubit is capacitively coupled
to a microstrip λ/2 resonator ( ωR/2π = 6.48 GHz) with
a coupling strength g/2π =69 MHz. The qubit parame-
ters measured from this device are shown in Table I, and
the qubit excited state decay curves are shown in Fig 3.

T1 =34.3 µs and T ∗
2 =22.5 µs, respectively. The Pur-
cell limit due to qubit-cavity coupling is 47µs [18], there-
fore we believe our measured T1 could be Purcell limited.
We used two methods to measure the decoherence time,
which are the “Ramsey” time (T ∗
2 ) and the “Echo” time
(T E
2 is
shown in the inset of Fig 3(b). To measure T E
2 , a π-pulse
is inserted half-way between the π/2 pulses. The π pulse
reverses the direction of dephasing for the second half of
the waiting time (∆t), thus it “echoes” out slow drifts in
the qubit frequency. We measured T E
2 , suggest-
ing that the qubit is subject to some low-frequency noise
that the echo successfully cancels out. However, since
T E
2 ≤ T1, this shows that there is also some decoher-
ence due to high-frequency noise, that the echo cannot
remove. The fact that qubits made with overlap junc-
tions have long coherence times shows that Josephson
junctions made with separate steps do not introduce ex-
tra loss to the superconducting quantum circuit.

In conclusion, we presented an alternative method of
fabricating nano-scale Josephson junctions for supercon-
ducting qubits. This method only involves normal-angle
evaporation, has no angle dependence, which makes it
compatible with large scale fabrication process. We also
demonstrated that a 2D transmon qubit made with over-
lap junctions still has long coherence. This opens up the

possibility of multi-step fabrication of Josephson junction
based qubits.
