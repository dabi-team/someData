Abstract Proportional electroluminescence (EL) in no-
ble gases is a physical process routinely used in two-
phase (liquid-gas) detectors for low-energy astroparticle-
physics experiments. In this work, the time properties
of visible-light EL in two-phase argon detectors have
been systematically studied for the ﬁrst time. In par-
ticular, two unusual slow components in the EL signal,
with their contributions and time constants increasing
with electric ﬁeld, were observed. This puzzling prop-
erty is not expected in any of the known mechanisms
of photon and electron emission in two-phase media.
Time constants of these components is about 4-5 µs
and 50 µs. In addition, a speciﬁc threshold behavior of
the slow components was revealed: they emerged at a
threshold in reduced electric ﬁeld of 4.8 ± 0.2 Td re-
gardless of the gas phase density, which is about 1 Td
above the onset of standard (excimer) EL. There is a
conspicuous similarity between this threshold and re-
duced ﬁeld threshold of EL in NIR occurring via higher
atomic excited states Ar∗(3p54p). An unexpected tem-
perature dependence of slow components was also ob-
served: their contribution decreased with temperature,
practically disappearing at room temperature. We show
that the puzzling properties of slow components can be
explained in the framework of hypothesis that these are
produced in the charge signal itself due to trapping of
drifting electrons on metastable negative argon ions.

1 Introduction

Proportional electroluminescence (EL) is used in two-
phase dark matter detectors and low energy neutrino
experiments [1,2,3] to measure the primary ionization
signal in the gas phase induced by particle scattering in
the liquid phase. Such a signal (S2) is recorded with a
delay relative to the primary scintillation signal (S1)
which is recorded promptly. The current best limits
on WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross-section were
obtained with two-phase detector conﬁguration using
both Xe [4,5] and Ar [6,7] gases. In light of this suc-
cess, there is interest both for more in-depth study of
these detectors and for conducting next-generation ex-
periments, in particular DarkSide-20k [8].

The study of time properties of the S2 signal, namely
of its pulse shape, is of great importance for the correct
interpretation of the data for dark matter searches, es-
pecially in the low-energy region where the “S2 only”
analysis is applied [7,5]. In addition, the S2 pulse shape
can be used to restore z-coordinate of the event [5,9]
and to measure the EL gap thickness to monitor po-
tential sagging of the wire electrodes [10].

There is, however, some ambiguity regarding S2 pulse
shapes in two-phase detectors: several abnormal slow
components or delayed pulses were observed in Xe-based
detectors on µs and ms scales [11, 12,13,14,15,16]. It
was proposed that these delayed pulses were induced
by delayed or trapped electrons, that is electrons which
arrive at anode later than expected from drift time of
primary ionization. The origin and quantitative descrip-
tion of these electrons is not yet determined and there
are diﬀerent interpretations and results across the refer-
ences above. Nonetheless, these delayed electrons, fol-
lowing the main S2 signal, eﬀectively increase single-
electron noise of the detector. It was argued that this

According to modern concepts [2], there are three
mechanisms responsible for proportional EL in noble
gases: that of excimer (Ar∗
2) emission in the VUV [42],
that of emission due to atomic transitions in the NIR
[43,32], and that of NBrS emission in the UV, visi-
ble and NIR range [21]. These three mechanisms are
referred to as excimer (ordinary) EL, atomic EL and
NBrS EL, respectively. The ﬁrst two are illustrated in
Fig. 1.

Neutral bremsstrahlung (NBrS) EL is due to brems-
strahlung of drifting electrons elastically scattered on
neutral atoms [21,26, 30]:

e− + Ar → e− + Ar + hν .

(1)

It has no threshold in energy and thus in electric ﬁeld.
This process is extremely fast, with characteristic time
less than 1 ps.

2 (minimums of potential energy
curves [33, 34]) and metastable negative ion state Ar− [35, 36],
all given in LS-coupling notation. The atomic levels are shown
with their mixing determined from [37]. The solid arrows in-
dicate the radiative transitions observed in experiments: Ar∗

in the VUV [38] and Ar∗ in the NIR [39, 40]. Time constants
for the VUV and NIR transitions are taken from [32] and [41]
respectively. The dashed arrows indicate the non-radiative
transitions. The ground states are composed of argon atoms
Ar (3p6 1S0) and Van-der-Waals dimers Ar2(X 1Σ+

g ).

eﬀect may explain excess of the S2-only signal rates
compared to expected background which was observed
earlier at low energies (low number of electrons) in the
DarkSide-50 [7] and XENON1T [17] experiments (see
discussion in [18]).

On the other hand, no dedicated studies of slow
components in EL (S2) signals have yet been carried
out in Ar. In this work, we ﬁll this gap: for the ﬁrst
time, the S2 time properties have been systematically
studied in two-phase Ar detectors in a wide range of
electric ﬁelds. The preliminary results of the study were
presented in [19, 20]. In those works, two unusual slow
components of S2 signals in two-phase Ar detector were
observed, with time constants of about 4-5 µs and 50 µs,
referred to as “slow” and “long” components respec-
tively. The S2 signals were recorded both in the vac-
uum ultraviolet (VUV) range and in that of visible and
near infrared (NIR). The spectral range of the latter
is provided by the neutral bremsstrahlung (NBrS) EL
mechanism, which was introduced in [21] and then fur-
ther studied in [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30].

Excimer EL is due to emission of noble gas ex-
cimers, in a singlet (Ar∗
2(1Σ+
u ))
state, produced in three-body atomic collisions of the
lowest excited atomic states, of Ar∗(3p54s) conﬁgura-
tion, which in turn are produced by drifting electrons
in electron-atom collisions (see reviews [1, 2, 32]):

Atomic EL is due to atomic transitions between
the higher (Ar∗(3p54p)) and lower (Ar∗(3p54s)) excited
states, the former being also produced by drifting elec-
trons [44,43]:

e− + Ar → e− + Ar∗(3p54p) ,
Ar∗(3p54p) → Ar∗(3p54s) + hν .

(3)

All mentioned EL mechanisms are described using
energy distribution of drifting electrons which is depen-
dent on reduced electric ﬁeld, E/N , where E is the elec-
tric ﬁeld and N is the atomic density. For this reason,
in the ﬁgures presented in this work, many quantities
are shown as a function of the reduced electric ﬁeld. It
is expressed in Td units: 1 Td = 10−17 V cm2, corre-
sponding to the electric ﬁeld of 0.87 kV/cm in gaseous
Ar in the two-phase mode at 87.3 K and 1.00 atm.

The puzzling property of the observed slow com-
ponents is that their contributions and time constants
increase with electric ﬁeld. Such an increase does not
correspond to either of the two known mechanisms of
slow component formation in two-phase Ar detectors,
namely to that of thermionic electron emission from
liquid to gas phase [45,46] and that of VUV scintil-
lation via triplet excimer state Ar∗
u ) [32]. In the
ﬁrst mechanism, slow component is caused by electrons

2(3Σ+

which are delayed on potential barrier at liquid-gas in-
terface. The higher electric ﬁeld, the easier it is for elec-
trons to satisfy conditions to exit the liquid, which re-
sults in decrease of both contribution and time constant
of slow component with increasing ﬁeld. In particular,
their values in argon are less than about 4% and 2 µs
respectively for electric ﬁeld in liquid of 2.5 kV/cm [45,
46].

2(3Σ+

In the case of excimer scintillation in VUV, there
are no delayed electrons. Rather, there is delay in emit-
ting photon which is caused by quite long (3.1 ± 0.1 µs)
lifetime of triplet state Ar∗
u ). If detector is made
sensitive to VUV, then recorded EL signal is deﬁned
almost fully by excimer scintillation mechanism for the
typical electric ﬁelds. In this case, the fast and slow
components of EL signal are produced by the singlet
(4.2 ns lifetime) and by the triplet states respectively.
The time constant of excimer slow component is equal
to the lifetime of triplet state and its contribution is
deﬁned by ratio of triplet and singlet states formed
in three-body collisions (see Eq. 2). Thus, both time
constant and contribution of excimer slow component
should not depend on the electric ﬁeld under condition
that VUV scintillation dominates recorded EL signal.
In our preliminary work [19] we studied the unusual
slow components using gamma-rays in detector conﬁgu-
ration with and without wavelength shifter (tetraphenyl
butadiene (TPB)), that is in conﬁguration sensitive to
excimer scintillation in VUV and sensitive only to the
scintillation in visible and NIR range respectively. In
the preliminary work, it was supposed that these com-
ponents are most likely present in the charge signal it-
self and that metastable negative Ar ions might be re-
sponsible for their formation. In this work, we study the
unusual slow components in a more elaborated way, in
particular using an alpha-particle source in addition to
that of gamma-ray. Moreover, to clarify the issue of the
origin of unusual slow components, we study their new
properties: the threshold behavior with respect to elec-
tric ﬁeld, the dependence on pressure (i.e. on density of
the gas phase) and the temperature dependence.

We show in section 4 that the results of this study
strongly support the hypothesis of metastable negative
argon ions being responsible for the formation of slow
components. Such negative ion states can be produced
either in 3-body collisions of drifting electrons with
Ar atoms or collisions with Van-der-Waals molecules
Ar2(X 1Σ+

g ) [32,47,48,49].

If our hypothesis is correct, then similarly to Xe,
Ar detectors have delayed electrons correlated to S2
signal. This will eﬀectively increase single-electron noise
of the detector, which in turn will aﬀect expected rates
of events with small number of electrons. Thus, this

eﬀect may change the sensitivity of Ar detectors at low
dark matter masses, near detector threshold.

2 Experimental setup

A schematic view of the two-phase detector used in this
work is shown in Fig. 2. The detector included a 9 L
cryogenic chamber ﬁlled with 2.5-3.5 liters of liquid Ar
and operated in a two-phase mode in equilibrium state
at a saturated vapor pressure of 1.00, 1.50 or 0.75 atm,
corresponding to a temperature of 87.3, 91.3 or 84.7 K

4

respectively [53]. In addition to usual working pressure
of 1.00 atm, the lowest and the highest possible val-
ues were used, the former being limited by argon triple
point and cryogenics performance, and the latter be-
ing limited by durability of Al windows at the bottom
of the chamber (see Fig. 2). Compared to the detec-
tor used in preliminary studies [19,20], there were only
minor modiﬁcations. In particular, the detector conﬁg-
uration without wavelength shifter (WLS) was used, i.e.
with direct optical readout in the visible and NIR range
using PMTs and a SiPM matrix.

Thick gas electron multiplier (THGEM) electrodes
of 10×10 cm2 active area were used to form drift region
(between the cathode and THGEM0), electron emission
region (above THGEM0) and EL gap (between the liq-
uid surface and THGEM1 anode). These regions had
electric ﬁelds of 0.093-0.68 kV/cm, 0.71-5.2 kV/cm and
1.1-8.0 kV/cm respectively, the voltage applied to the
divider varying from 3 to 22 kV. Electric ﬁeld unifor-
mity of this geometry was studied in [54] and found to
be satisfactory, meaning that expected systematic er-
ror from non-uniformity was determined to be much
less than other systematic errors of values we measure.
During the measurements, the EL gap thickness could
be decreased by liquefying an additional amount of Ar.
In particular, two values of 18 and 10 mm were used
in this work. The liquid level was calculated from the
amount of condensed Ar using CAD software and was
veriﬁed in calibration runs using THGEM1 as a capac-
itive liquid level meter.

At the start of each experimental run, Ar gas was
liqueﬁed from a storage bottle into the cryogenic cham-
ber while passing through Oxysorb ﬁlter in order to
purify it from electronegative impurities. The initial Ar
total impurity content declared by manufacturer was
below 2 ppm. This ﬁltration process was demonstrated
to achieve electron life-time in liquid Ar > 100 µs at
200 V/cm ﬁeld [55], which corresponds to oxygen con-
tent below few ppb. Additionally, the N2 content was
monitored by a gas analyzer SVET [56] based on an
emission spectrum measurement technique: it was be-
low 1 ppm. At the end of the run, Ar was collected from
the chamber back into the bottle cooled with liquid ni-
trogen.

In this work, the S2 signals from the EL gap were
optically recorded in the visible and NIR range using
the eﬀect of NBrS EL [21,25]. Optical readout of the
EL gap was provided by four compact PMTs R6041-
506MOD [57, 58], placed on every side of the gap, and
by a 5×5 SiPM matrix composed of 13360-6050PE type
SiPMs [50], with 1 cm pitch, located above the anode.
Their quantum eﬃciency (QE) and photon detection ef-
ﬁciency (PDE), respectively, are shown in Fig. 3, along

with example of the NBrS EL spectrum. Each PMT and
SiPM channel was read out individually at 62.5 MS/s
rate for a total waveform of 160 µs duration. The sum
of all the PMT channels was used for triggering by the
S2 signal. Even though the SiPM matrix detects larger
number of photoelectrons, correlated noise prevented
us from using sum of even few of its channels for trig-
gering.

To reach the PMTs, the photons produced in the EL
gap passed through 4 mm thick walls of the UV acrylic
box, while to reach the SiPMs the photons passed through
a 1.5 mm thick acrylic plate (see Fig. 3 for their trans-
mission spectra). In addition, the THGEM1 plate in
front of the SiPM matrix acted as an optical mask; it
had dielectric thickness of 0.94 mm, hole pitch of 1.1
mm, hole diameter of 1.0 mm, and thus provided a 75%
optical transparency at normal incidence.

Two radioactive sources were used for S2 pulse-shape
measurements: a 109Cd gamma-ray source on W sub-
strate, having high-energy (58-69 and 88 keV) and low-
energy (22-25 keV) lines [59], and a 238Pu alpha-particle
source having a 5.5 MeV line. The latter was placed on
the top of the cathode (Fig. 2). When 238Pu was used
in the detector, the gamma rays from 109Cd source did
not reach active volume due to absorption in Pu sub-
strate (2 mm of steel). Thus each experimental run was
conducted only using one of the two radioactive sources.

In measurements of the temperature dependence of
slow components contribution, the detector conﬁgura-
tion with alpha-particle source was used. In order to
change temperature while having ﬁxed Ar density, it is
necessary to use single-phase mode (only gaseous Ar),
since the two-phase mode dictates that temperature
and density are directly linked according to saturated
vapor curve. The measurements were conducted at dif-
ferent temperatures and at the same Ar gas atomic den-
sity, of 3.7·1019 cm−3, corresponding to 1.5 atm pres-
sure at room temperature, the chamber temperature
being varied from that of room (295 K) to 120 K. The
mean path length of 5.5 MeV alpha particles at this gas
density is 3.1 cm which corresponds up to 11.7 µs drift
time at 0.24 kV/cm (0.63 Td) if the track is collinear to
the electric ﬁeld. For this reason, the tracks orthogonal
to the electric ﬁeld had to be selected in order to local-
ize ionization along z-axis. Otherwise, the resulting EL
pulse shapes are complicated by interplay of non-trivial
charge distribution and unusual slow components.

More detailed description of the detector, trigger, as
well as full procedure of data analysis can be found in
our preliminary work [19].

3 Results

3.1 Measurements of S2 amplitudes and pulse shapes
in two-phase detector

As was demonstrated in [22,25], the NBrS eﬀect al-
lows for direct recording the EL (S2) signals in two-
phase Ar detectors, i.e. without using WLS. An ex-
ample waveform of such S2 signal event obtained with
alpha-particle source is shown in Fig. 4. Each peak in
the waveform corresponds to at least one photoelectron
(PE) produced by a photon in the SiPM. This ﬁgure
clearly demonstrates the presence of both the fast and
slow components in the signal.

In addition, Fig. 5 shows the sum of such wave-
forms over all the 25 channels of the SiPM matrix and
over all selected events, reﬂecting the raw pulse shape

for the given experimental run. In addition to fast and
slow components, the latter having a time constant of
about 5 µs, one can also see the second slow compo-
nent, further referred to as “long” component, with a
tenfold larger time constant, of about 50 µs. The weak
primary scintillation (S1) signal was also observed at
about 30 µs before the S2 signal (for its details see
the recent study on visible-light scintillations in liquid
Ar [60]).

For the correct analysis of the S2 pulse shape it is
necessary to separate the events induced by radioactive
sources from background (mostly caused by cosmic rays
and radioactivity of materials inside the detector). This

selection was provided by the analysis of the S2 ampli-
tudes expressed in the number of photoelectrons (NP E)
recorded by the SiPM matrix and PMTs: see Figs. 6, 7
and 8. One can see that for the 109Cd gamma-ray source
the high-energy peak, composed of 58-69 and 88 keV
lines, is well separated from that of low energy, com-
posed of 22-25 keV lines. In these ﬁgures only single
events are shown, double and other multiple superim-
posed events being discarded (see [19] for details).

The red lines in Figs. 7 and 8 show amplitude cuts
for selecting events for further analysis of the S2 pulse
shape, namely the events of high-energy peaks of the
109Cd and 238Pu sources. Note that the S2 amplitude
of high-energy peak for Pu source (420 PE) is six times
larger than that of Cd source (70 PE). High-energy
peaks were selected for several reasons. Firstly, they
provide larger statistics for the S2 pulse-shapes due to
larger number of PE. Secondly, larger number of PE
means better selection of single events (see detailed pro-
cedure in [19]) which is especially crucial at low electric
ﬁelds. Lastly, low-energy peaks have larger fraction of
background events.

Fig. 9 shows the electric ﬁeld dependence of the am-
plitude of the total S2 signal, which includes all time
components. A noticeable amplitude of the signal below
the threshold of excimer EL, i.e. below 4 Td, reﬂects the
NBrS nature of proportional EL (see section 1 for de-
tails). The fast rise of the amplitude with electric ﬁeld
is explained by two eﬀects: by ﬁeld dependence of ion-
ization yield from alpha-particle tracks in liquid Ar [61]
and by ﬁeld dependence of NBrS EL itself [2,26].

To study the time properties of EL signals in detail,
the time histogram of the recorded photoelectrons for
the selected events was produced (see Fig. 10). Each
photoelectron gave one entry in the histogram with its
own recorded time. The resulting histogram thus re-
ﬂects the real S2 pulse shape averaged over all selected
events. Only such signal shapes for the selected 109Cd
and 238Pu events are used and analyzed.

3.2 Electric ﬁeld dependence and threshold behavior
of slow components

Fig. 10 illustrates how the slow components emerge and
how much they contribute to the overall signal. The S2
pulse shapes are shown at low (3.8 Td), middle (5.5 Td)
and high (8.0 Td) reduced electric ﬁelds. At low ﬁeld,
as expected, only the fast component due to NBrS EL
is present in the signal. Its shape is deﬁned mainly by
the electron drift time across the EL gap, and, to a
lesser extent, by electron diﬀusion, trigger conditions
and light collection non-uniformity [9,19].

middle (5.5 Td) and high (8.0 Td) reduced electric ﬁeld, obtained with 238Pu alpha particles due to NBrS EL in 18 mm thick
EL gap at 1.00 atm.

At higher ﬁelds, exceeding 5 Td, a 4-5 µs slow com-
ponent emerges and increases with electric ﬁeld in both
contribution and time constant: see Figs. 9,11, 12, 13. A
50 µs long component also becomes apparent on loga-
rithmic scale, as seen in Fig. 5, with similar electric ﬁeld
dependence. At reduced electric ﬁelds exceeding 8.0 Td
the total contribution of the slow and long components
to the overall signal becomes quite large, reaching 50%.
One can also see from Fig. 10 that the PMT and SiPM-
matrix data are in good agreement; accordingly, all fur-
ther results show time constants and contributions as
average of ﬁtted values for the PMTs and the SiPM-
matrix.

It should be noted that the contributions of the fast
and slow components are deﬁned here in the same way
as in [19]. Namely, the pulse area before the time point
of the characteristic bend at around 32 µs (see Fig. 10)
is considered to be fully fast component and everything
after is considered to be only the slow and long com-
ponents. The slow and long components are separated
from each other using exponential ﬁts. Proper separa-
tion from the fast component requires a speciﬁc physical
model of the slow components, but the current ”rough”
approach is suﬃcient for our purposes.

The increase of contribution and time constants of
slow and long components with electric ﬁeld can not

crease with electric ﬁeld [45,46]. Hence we call the slow
components in Figs. 5 and 10 “unusual”.

To better understand the nature of these compo-
nents, their threshold behavior has been investigated.
The results are presented in Fig. 9 in terms of the am-
plitude characteristics and in Figs. 11, 12 and 13 in
terms of the slow components contribution to overall

signal. These ﬁgures clearly demonstrate that the am-
plitude and contribution of the slow and long compo-
nents has a certain threshold in the reduced electric
ﬁeld. In Figs. 11, 12 and 13 the nominal threshold is
deﬁned as the intersection of a linearly increasing func-
tion ﬁtted to data above the threshold and a horizontal
line ﬁtted to data below the threshold, the latter cor-
responding to background baseline.

Total systematic uncertainty of threshold value was
estimated to be about 0.2 Td (standard deviation).
This uncertainty has two main contributions of about
the same magnitude. The ﬁrst contribution is an un-
certainty of electric ﬁelds values (≈0.12 Td) due to an
uncertainty of the EL gap thickness (about 1 mm). The
second one (≈0.14 Td) is due to uncertainty of ﬁtted
lines determining the nominal threshold both due to in-
clusion or exclusion of points near the threshold from
the ﬁts and due to errors of the points themselves. The
main error of the latter is systematic error due to event
selection.

It should be noted that large errors of long compo-
nent time constant in Fig. 13 are also almost fully due
systematic uncertainty from the event selection. The
reason why long component is so sensitive to the event
selection is to be further investigated.

One can see that the nominal threshold is the same
for both slow components, regardless of the type of ir-
radiation (gamma rays or alpha particles). Moreover,
it is interesting that its value, about 5 Td, is about
1 Td higher than the threshold of excimer EL in Ar
(4.1 ± 0.1 Td) [32,42]. This means that the slow com-
ponents are not related to the excimer EL mechanism.
This also explains why the DarkSide-50 experiment did
not observe these unusual slow components: its opera-
tional reduced electric ﬁeld in the EL gap, of 4.6 Td [7],
was not enough for this.

Finally, it was this higher threshold for the appear-
ance of the slow components that made it possible to
observe the diﬀerence between the fast signal of NBrS
EL and slow signal of excimer EL and thus helped to
reveal the NBrS eﬀect in proportional EL (see Fig. 19
in [21]; by chance, the working ﬁeld there was just at
the level of 5.0 Td, i.e. at the verge of appearance of
the unusual slow components and therefore was too low
for them to interfere).

Also, we observed that the slow components thresh-
old did not depend on the gas phase pressure, i.e. on the
Ar gas density, as shown in Fig. 14: the nominal thresh-
old for slow component appearance was again close to
5 Td and consistent with data at 1 atm pressure within
0.2 Td uncertainty. On the other hand, it is clearly seen
that above the threshold, the slow component contribu-
tion is larger for higher pressures.

phase Ar detector with 238Pu alpha particles due to NBrS

and 1.5 atm. The arrow points to the nominal threshold of

function of the reduced electric ﬁeld, obtained in [19] in two-
phase Ar detector with WLS-based readout, i.e. sensitive to
excimer EL, with 109Cd gamma rays in 18 mm thick EL gap
at 1.00 atm. The arrow points to the nominal threshold of
the time constant increase.

It should be noted, that the two data points at the
lowest electric ﬁelds for 0.75 atm are outliers, compared
to that of 1.5 atm and 1.0 atm. This is because the abso-
lute electric ﬁeld in liquid Ar at 0.75 atm was quite low
for those points, 1.4 and 1.6 kV/cm, resulting in that
the “usual” slow component due to electron emission
from liquid to gas phase [45,46] became observable.

The independence of the threshold of the gas den-
sity demonstrates that the unusual slow components are
not related to the liquid-gas interface. Processes at the
liquid-gas interface (known or otherwise) are driven by
the absolute electric ﬁeld, so if the unusual slow com-
ponents were related to this, the threshold would be
constant in the absolute ﬁeld and not the reduced one.
In other words, the unusual slow components appear in
the EL gap itself.

In addition to the results with NBrS EL, the simi-
lar threshold behavior of the slow component was ob-
served for excimer EL in time constant dependence on
the electric ﬁeld. Fig. 15 shows the results obtained in
our previous work [19] in the two-phase detector with
WLS-based readout, sensitive in the VUV and thus to
excimer EL. In this ﬁgure, the triplet slow component of
excimer EL with time constant of 3.3 µs is clearly seen
between 4 Td (the threshold for excimer EL in Ar [2])
and 5 Td, while above 5 Td the time constant linearly
increases with electric ﬁeld. As discussed in [19], such a
speciﬁc behavior of the time constant may be explained
only if the unusual slow component is added to the
charge signal itself above 5 Td, resulting in the appro-
priate increase of the overall time constant. Note that

going via Ar∗(3p54s) excited states, and in the NIR due to
atomic EL, going via Ar∗(3p54p) excited states, measured
respectively in [22] and [44] (data points). The solid line and
the hatched area show the theoretical predictions for those
EL mechanisms given in [42] and [43] respectively. The arrows
indicate the thresholds in reduced electric ﬁeld for those EL
mechanisms.

the nominal threshold for this increase again amounts
to about 5 Td.

3.3 Correspondence of 5 Td threshold to Ar∗(3p54p)
atomic levels and slow to long component ratio

Excimer EL has a certain threshold in reduced electric
ﬁeld, of about 4 Td, deﬁned by the lowest atomic exci-
tation levels Ar∗(3p54s). This threshold is well seen in

10

Fig. 17 Ratio of slow to long component contribution and
that of slow to fast component contribution as a function of
the reduced electric ﬁeld, obtained in two-phase Ar detector
with 238Pu alpha particles due to NBrS EL in 18 mm thick
EL gap at 1.00 atm. The PMT and SiPM data are averaged.

Fig. 16 from the EL yield dependence on the electric
ﬁeld, both for theoretical and experimental data.

Similarly, one can see from this ﬁgure that atomic
EL has about 1 Td higher threshold compared to ex-
cimer EL, at about 5 Td [43], deﬁned by higher excita-
tion levels Ar∗(3p54p), which have about 1.5 eV higher
energy compared to those of Ar∗(3p54s).

Thus one may conclude that the threshold in re-
duced electric ﬁeld of 5 Td observed for slow compo-
nents unambiguously indicates that the higher excited
states Ar∗(3p54p) are somehow related to their produc-
tion mechanism, and that this is not the case for the
lower excited states Ar∗(3p54s). This is a remarkable
conclusion, since it states that there are some selection
rules in the slow component formation mechanism that
suppress the inclusion of lower excited states despite
their energy favor, and at the same time allow the in-
clusion of higher excited states.

Also, the fact that the electric ﬁeld threshold is the
same for both slow and long components indicates that
these are related to each other and produced by the
same mechanism. This conclusion is further conﬁrmed
by the electric ﬁeld independence of the ratio of the
slow to long component contribution, in contrast to that
of slow to fast component contribution, as shown in
Fig. 17.

3.4 Temperature dependence of slow components

The temperature dependence of unusual slow compo-
nents may shed some light on the mechanisms of their
formation. To this end, the measurements of S2 pulse
shapes were conducted at diﬀerent temperatures but
at the same Ar density. Such measurements were only

Fig. 18 Contribution of the long component to overall sig-
nal (at times exceeding 55 µs with respect to the fast compo-
nent) as a function of temperature, obtained in single (gas)
phase Ar detector with 238Pu alpha particles for tempera-
tures above 100 K, at ﬁxed gas density (corresponding to
1.5 atm at 295 K) and ﬁxed reduced electric ﬁeld in the EL
gap (6.8 Td). For completeness, the data point at 84.7 K and
0.75 atm obtained in the two-phase mode with 10 mm EL gap
is also shown. The solid curve is theoretical ﬁt of single-phase
data points by a function proportional to NAr2 in Eq. 7. The
curve is extrapolated to the two-phase data point. The PMT
and SiPM data are averaged.

possible in a single-phase mode, since the two-phase
mode dictates that temperature and density are directly
linked according to saturated vapor curve. The mea-
surements were conducted at a constant Ar atomic den-
sity, of 3.74·1019 cm−3, corresponding to 1.5 atm pres-
sure at room temperature (295 K), and with 5.5 MeV
alpha-particle source 238Pu installed on the cathode as
shown in Fig. 2. The reduced electric ﬁeld in EL gap
was the same for all measurements and amounted to
6.8 Td, with corresponding drift ﬁeld of 0.24 kV/cm or
0.63 Td.

The mean path length of 5.5 MeV alpha particle
at the Ar density used is 3.1 cm which corresponds
to 11.7 µs drift time if the track is collinear to the
electric ﬁeld. For this reason, the tracks orthogonal to
the electric ﬁeld had to be selected in order to local-
ize ionization along z-axis. Otherwise, the resulting EL
pulse shapes are complicated by interplay of non-trivial
charge distribution and unusual slow components. The
track selection was provided using the fast component
width, the minimal widths corresponding to orthogonal
tracks.

The measured dependence of the long component
contribution on Ar gas temperature is shown in Fig. 18.
Note that the point at 84.7 K obtained in the two-phase
mode and shown in the ﬁgure for completeness has the
gas-phase density higher by a factor of 1.8 compared to

single-phase data. The temperature dependence looks
puzzling: the contribution rapidly decreases with tem-
perature and almost disappears above 250 K. Such a
dependence is not expected in any of the known scintil-
lation mechanisms. In the next section we try to explain
this result.

The temperature dependence of the 5 µs slow com-
ponent is not shown because of its poor separation from
the fast component as well as signiﬁcant systemati-
cal errors due to poor track orthogonality. Nonetheless,
preliminary results show that the slow component con-
tribution also decreased with temperature.

4 Hypothesis of metastable negative argon ions
responsible for the formation of slow
components

All results described above can be successfully explained
in the framework of the hypothesis proposed in [19],
namely that the unusual slow components appear in the
charge signal itself. In this hypothesis, the slow compo-
nents are produced in the charge signal due to trap-
ping of electrons for some time during their drift in the
EL gap, the photon emission before and after trapping
being provided by the NBrS EL mechanism. It is pro-
posed that the formation of metastable negative argon
ions (Ar−) might be responsible for such trapping.

Here we suppose that such negative ion states can
be produced either in 3-body collisions of drifting elec-
trons with Ar atoms or collisions with Van-der-Waals
molecules Ar2(X 1Σ+
g ) [32,47,48,49], followed by their
decay with appropriate time constants:

e− + Ar2(X 1Σ+

e− + 2Ar → Ar− + Ar ,
g ) → Ar− + Ar ,
Ar− → e− + Ar .

(4)

(5)

(6)

Ar2(X 1Σ+

g ) molecule has a rather low binding en-
ergy, of 12 meV [47,48], which is comparable with the
thermal energy at 87 K (10 meV). Therefore, their con-
tent at this temperature, relative to that of the ground
states composed from Ar atoms and Ar2 dimers (see
Fig. 1), is only 2.7%; it was deduced from [49] using
temperature and density dependence of Eq. 7 taken
from [62]. This content nevertheless might be enough to
make this channel dominating, since the reaction of dis-
sociative attachment (Eq. 5) has typically much higher
rate than that of three-body collisions (Eq. 4) [63,64].
The advantage of this approach is that it can explain
the increase of the slow component contribution with
electric ﬁeld: the formation of metastable ions has an
energy threshold and the higher the electric ﬁeld is, the
larger the probability of electron having enough energy

11

to become trapped. As discussed in section 3.3, both
slow and long component have the same threshold in
electric ﬁeld and the ratio of their contributions does
not depend on the electric ﬁeld. As such, unusual slow
components have likely the same formation mechanism
related to the Ar∗(3p54p) states. This means that either
metastable negative argon ions have similar energy level
or some intermediate state responsible for their forma-
tion is related to Ar∗(3p54p).

In addition, the proposed mechanism of electron
trapping predicts the increase of the slow component
contribution with gas density observed in experiment
(see Fig. 14): larger atomic density means higher prob-
ability for the electron to form a metastable negative
ion during its drift through the EL gap.

Moreover, in the frame of this approach it is possi-
ble to explain the puzzling temperature dependence of
the slow components, assuming that they are produced
mostly due to electron collisions with Van-der-Waals
molecules Ar2(X 1Σ+
g ) in reaction (5). In this case, neg-
ative ion production rate is proportional to the Ar2 con-
centration (NAr2), which is described by the following
temperature dependence [62]:

NAr2 = N 2

Ar λ3
dB exp((cid:15)Ar2/kBT ) ,
λdB = (cid:112)h2/(2πµkBT ) ,

(7)

where NAr is the Ar atom concentration, λdB is the
thermal de Broglie wavelength of the Ar2 molecule of
reduced mass µ, (cid:15)Ar2 is the Ar2 binding energy, of 12
meV (positive). One can see from Fig. 18 that the tem-
perature dependence of Eq. 7 successfully describes the
single-phase data, obtained at a constant gas density
and electric ﬁeld.

Two possible candidates for the metastable nega-
tive ion states were suggested earlier in [19]: that of
Feshbach resonances Ar−(3p54s2 2P1/2,3/2) with the en-
ergy levels of 11.10 and 11.28 eV and lifetime of about
0.3 ps [65] and that of metastable Ar−(3p54s4p4S) state
with the energy level of 11.52 eV and lifetime of about
260 ns [35,36]. For both states the two outer electrons
are in excited orbitals, resulting in that their forma-
tion should have a threshold in energy and in reduced
electric ﬁeld. The latter should be close to that of ex-
cimer EL, i.e. to about 4 Td, due to the close values
of the negative ion energy levels to those of the lowest
excitation Ar states (Ar∗(3p54s)), involved in the ex-
cimer formation process (see Fig.1). In particular, the
minimum energy of Ar∗(3p54s) states, 11.55 eV, is very
close to 11.52 eV energy of Ar−(3p54s4p 4S).

On the other hand, the negative ion states consid-
ered above can hardly be responsible for such electron
trapping, since their lifetimes and thresholds in electric
ﬁeld are too small compared to observations. Indeed,

12

the simultaneous presence with comparable contribu-
tions of the fast component (corresponding to electrons
drifting through the EL gap without being trapped)
and the slow components indicates that the mean path
for electron trapping is of the order of the EL gap thick-
ness, according to Poisson statistics. In other words,
two or more electron captures during the drift time
are unlikely. This means that the negative Ar ion life-
time should be of the same order as that of the slow
components time constants, i.e. of the order of 5 and
50 µs. This is not the case for Feshbach resonances
and metastable Ar−(3p54s4p 4S) state. Moreover, the
threshold for their formation in reduced electric ﬁeld
of 4 Td does not correspond to the slow component
appearance threshold of 5 Td.

Accordingly, the nature of metastable negative Ar
ions responsible for the unusual slow components in EL
of two-phase Ar detectors remains unknown.

gap in the charge signal itself, due to trapping of drift-
ing electrons on metastable negative Ar ions of yet un-
known nature with lifetimes close to that of the slow
component time constants, i.e. about 5 and 50 µs. Tak-
ing into the account the 5 Td threshold, the forma-
tion of these metastable Ar ions is related either to the
Ar∗(3p54p) states or some unknown state with similar
energy level. In the frame of this approach it is pos-
sible to explain the puzzling temperature dependence
of the slow components, if one assumes that they are
produced mostly at low temperatures due to electron
collisions with Van-der-Waals molecules Ar2(X 1Σ+

g ).

The results obtained may have practical applica-
tions for the development of two-phase Ar detectors for
dark matter searches and low-energy neutrino experi-
ments.

Further studies of the slow component puzzle are in

progress in our laboratory.

5 Conclusions

Acknowledgments

In this work, we have for the ﬁrst time systematically
studied the time properties of proportional electrolumi-
nescence (EL) in two-phase Ar detectors. Two unusual
slow components with time constants of about 4-5 and
50 µs were observed, which is consistent with our pre-
liminary reports [19,20].

Their puzzling property is that their contributions
and time constants increase with electric ﬁeld, which is
not expected in any of the known mechanisms of photon
and electron emission in two-phase media. In addition,
a speciﬁc threshold behavior of the slow components
was revealed: they emerged at a threshold in reduced
electric ﬁeld of about 5 Td regardless of the gas phase
density, which is 1 Td above the onset of standard (ex-
cimer) EL, the latter being related to the lower excited
atomic states Ar∗(3p54s).

Accordingly, it is shown that the 5 Td threshold is
related to the higher atomic excited states Ar∗(3p54p).
This is a remarkable conclusion, since it states that
there exist some selection rules in the slow component
formation mechanism that suppress the inclusion of the
lower excited states despite their energy favor, and at
the same time allow the inclusion of the higher excited
states.

An unexpected temperature dependence of the 50 µs
component (and presumably that of 5 µs) was also
observed: its contribution decreased with temperature,
practically disappearing at room temperature.

We show that all puzzling properties of the slow
components can be successfully explained in the frame-
work of hypothesis that these are produced in the EL
