Abstract 

The  impact  of  400 keV Ar+  ion  irradiation on  the  magnetic  and  electrical  properties  of  in-plane 
magnetized magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) stacks was investigated by ferromagnetic resonance, 
vibrating  sample  magnetometry  and  current-in-plane  tunneling  techniques.  The  irradiation-
induced changes of the magnetic anisotropy, coupling energies and  tunnel magnetoresistance 
(TMR)  exhibited  a  correlated  dependence  on  the  ion  fluence,  which  allowed  us  to  distinguish 
between  two  irradiation  regimes.  In  the  low-fluence  regime,  Œ¶ <  1014 cm‚àí2,  the  parameters 
required for having a functioning MTJ were preserved: the anisotropy of the FeCoB free layer (FL) 
was weakly modulated following a small decrease in the saturation magnetization MS; the TMR 
decreased  continuously;  the  interlayer  exchange  coupling  (IEC)  and  the  exchange  bias  (EB) 
decreased slightly. In the high-fluence regime, Œ¶ > 1014 cm‚àí2, the MTJ was rendered inoperative: 
the modulation of the FL anisotropy was strong, caused by a strong decrease in MS, ascribed to 
a high degree of interface intermixing between the FL and the Ta capping; the EB and IEC were 
also lost, likely due to intermixing of the layers composing the synthetic antiferromagnet; and the 
TMR vanished due to the irradiation-induced deterioration of the MgO barrier and MgO/FeCoB 
interfaces. We demonstrate that the layers surrounding the FL play a decisive role in determining 
the  trend  of  the  magnetic  anisotropy  evolution  resulting  from  the  irradiation,  and  that  an  ion-
fluence window exists where such a modulation of magnetic anisotropy can occur, while not losing 
the TMR or the magnetic configuration of the MTJ.

Introduction 

09/04/2020 

One advantage of the magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) compared to technologies that 
rely  on  electric  charge  for  information  storage  (e.g.  dynamic  RAM)  is  its  superior  radiation 
hardness with respect to gamma rays and charged particles in the MeV range. That hardness 
makes  MRAM  promising  for  applications  in  extreme  environments1.  Still,  magnetic  tunnel 
junctions  (MTJs)  are  not  tolerant  to  all  sorts  of  radiation2‚Äì4:  indeed,  ion-irradiation-induced 
modifications of MTJs have been observed, extending from soft errors (undesired but recoverable 
magnetization switching, provoked by localized heating4) to permanent changes in magnetic and 
electrical  properties  produced  by  structural  modifications.  The  degree  of  such  modifications  is 
governed by the spatial profile of the total energy deposited in the materials, which is dependent 
on  the  ion  mass  and  charge  state,  kinetic  energy,  fluence,  target  composition  and  target 
temperature. Various ion species (e.g. He+, Ga+ and Ar+), with energies ranging from hundreds of 
eV to hundreds of MeV and fluences Œ¶ between 1011 cm‚àí2 and 1017 cm‚àí2, have been used to 
purposefully modify properties of magnetic multilayers including MTJs. 

The research regarding the tailoring of magnetism via ion irradiation published until 2004 
was reviewed in Ref.5. Some noteworthy results on the control of magnetism by ion irradiation 
include the reorientation of the magnetization direction from out-of-plane to in-plane and also to 
oblique orientations in Pt/Co multilayers6‚Äì8; control of magnitude and direction of the exchange-
bias  field  at  ferromagnet/antiferromagnet  interfaces9‚Äì11;  changes  of  the  N√©el  coupling  via  ion-
beam smoothing of interfaces12; reduction of the annealing temperature required for crystallizing 
CoFeB in MgO-based MTJs13; decrease in critical current density for spin-orbit torque switching 
in Pt/Co/Ta14; improvement of the microwave emission linewidth of a spin-torque nano-oscillator15, 
and tuning of the types16 and of the velocity of propagation17 of domain walls. Ion irradiation further 
enables  lateral  patterning  which  has  been  proposed  for  the  definition  of  magnetoresistive 
sensors5 as well as exploited for creating skyrmions18,19 and for producing magnonic crystals for 
controlling the spin wave propagation20‚Äì22. 

In a previous work23 we demonstrated that 400 keV Ar+ ion irradiation can induce the easy-
cone anisotropy in initially perpendicularly magnetized MgO/FeCoB/X/FeCoB/MgO stacks (X = 
Ta or W spacer). Such an easy-cone anisotropy is sought after as it can lead to faster and lower-
energy spin-transfer torque (STT) switching, thanks to the intrinsic tilt in magnetization direction 
provided by the easy cone24‚Äì26. The use of ion irradiation in Ref.23 was motivated by the fact that 
it can be technologically challenging to reproducibly set the easy-cone ground state in multilayer 
stacks containing a FeCoB/MgO interface, as it is only accessible within a narrow range of FeCoB 
thicknesses (see e.g. Refs.27,28). 

However, ion irradiation has a known detrimental effect on the tunnel magnetoresistance 
(TMR), that has been reported for AlOx-based2,29 and MgO-based3,30 MTJs, usually attributed to 
the creation of defects within the oxide barrier. While this detrimental effect may be reduced by 
annealing9, it will impose an upper limit on the ion fluence that can be used to manipulate magnetic 
anisotropy while simultaneously keeping a functioning MTJ. 

Here we explore the extent of effects produced by 400 keV Ar+ irradiation on the interface-
controlled parameters of a complete MTJ stack, namely, magnetic anisotropy, TMR, exchange 
bias,  interlayer-exchange  coupling  and  magnetization  damping,  by  combining  ferromagnetic 
resonance,  vibrating  sample  magnetometry  and  current-in-plane  tunneling  techniques.  The 
trends  of  the  magnetic  anisotropy  evolution  resulting  from  the  irradiation,  as  well  as  the  ion-
fluence window where such a modulation of magnetic anisotropy can occur, while not losing the 
TMR or the magnetic configuration of the MTJ, are determined.

Experimental details 

09/04/2020 

MTJ multilayer stacks were prepared by dc magnetron sputtering on thermally oxidized 8-inch Si 
wafers. The structure of the stacks is Si / SiO2 / Ta(3) / CuN(30) / Ta(5) / Ru(2) / IrMn(12) / PL(2) 
/ Ru(0.8) / RL(2.3)/ MgO(1.5) / FL(tFL) / Ta(5) / Ru(7), where PL, RL and FL are, respectively, the 
pinned,  reference  and  free  layer,  made  of  FeCo(B)  alloys.  The  numbers  in  parentheses  are 
nominal thicknesses in nanometers. The wafers were annealed at 310¬∫C with a 1 T applied field 
to set the exchange-bias direction. A total of four wafers were prepared with nominal thickness of 
the FL, tFL, of 2.0 nm, 1.8 nm, 1.7 nm and 1.6 nm. 

The  multilayers  were  subsequently  irradiated  with  400 keV  Ar+  ions  at  fluences  (ÔÅÜ) 
ranging  from  1012 cm‚àí2  to 5√ó1015 cm‚àí2.  According  to  ballistic  simulations  using  the  TRIM 
(Transport and Range of Ions in Matter) software31, the kinetic energy and ion mass combination 
guarantee  that  Ar+  ions  are  implanted  deep  inside  the  Si  substrate  while  inelastic  and  elastic 
energy-transfer  processes  occur  within  the  multilayer  stack.  According  to  those  simulations, 
elemental  intermixing  occurs  at  the  interfaces,  with  composition  changes  of  a  few  percent 
expected for an ion fluence of 1014 cm‚àí2 (see SM1 of the Supplemental Material). 

The extraction of magnetic parameters started from the description of the magnetic energy 

density, E, in mJ ‚àô m‚àí2, of the multilayer in a macrospin approximation as

X-band  (9.87  GHz)  angle-dependent  ferromagnetic  resonance  (FMR)  and  vibrating 
sample  magnetometer  (VSM)  measurements  were  carried  out  before  and  after  irradiation  to 
measure changes in BK1eff
 and in JEB and JIEC with increasing ion fluence. As JN√©el ‚âà 0, the energy 
of the FL, EFL, can be decoupled from that of the SAF and rewritten as:

The  calculated  angular  dependence  of  the  resonance  field  (starting  from  equation  (2)  and 
applying the Smit-Beljers formalism32) was then fitted to experimental results in order to extract 
FL
BK1eff

. 

Starting from equation (1), the FMR modes (precession frequency versus field) and the 
FMR absorption curves of the MTJ were simulated following the approaches used in Ref.33 and 
Ref.34, respectively. Angular dependences of the FMR linewidth, ‚àÜBPP(œïB), encompassing both 
the  intrinsic  and  the  inhomogeneous  (due  to  local  resonances  and  two-magnon  scattering) 
broadening contributions, were simulated following the methodology of Ref.35. 

The TMR was measured via current-in-plane tunneling (CIPT) technique, with a micro 4-
point prober by CAPRES A/S, following the protocol of Ref.36. Additionally, resistance loops as a 
function of field, R(H), were obtained, but for a fixed spacing of the probes. For that reason, the 
presented R(H) loops (see e.g. figure 4) reflect the magnetic configuration of the stack but do not 
reflect the magnitude of the TMR (see e.g. inset of figure 4). The CIPT technique was chosen for 
its flexibility, as it allowed the determination of TMR without the need to perform lateral patterning 
of MTJ pillars. Yet, in order to apply this technique, a metallic pathway between the prober and 
the magnetic free layer of the MTJ has to be ensured. Therefore, a double-MgO free layer as the 
one studied in Ref.23 was not adequate for this study, and a single-MgO free layer, composed of 
MgO/FeCoB/Ta was used instead. This distinction in the multilayer stack design has important 
consequences for the effect of irradiation on the magnetic properties, that will be discussed.

Results and discussion 

Stack properties before irradiation 

Areal  magnetization  versus  field  curves  (figure  1)  were  measured  for  the  case  of  an  in-plane 
applied  external  field  ùêá.  For  positive  (negative)  values  of  the  field,  ùêá  is  directed  antiparallel 
(parallel)  to  the  exchange-bias  field  (i.e.  œïH = 180¬∞  for  H > 0).  Four  plateaus  are  identified, 
corresponding to different magnetic configurations, depicted in figure 1 as: (1) saturation of the 
magnetization of the three layers along the field direction; (2) parallel configuration of the MTJ, 
obtained  after  the  switching  of  MPL;  (3)  antiparallel  configuration  of  the  MTJ,  following  the 
switching  of  MFL;  and  (4)  saturation  in  the  direction  opposite  to  (1).  Using  the  values  of  each 
plateau  (see  SM2  in  the  Supplemental  Material)  the  magnetization  values  were  estimated  as 
MRL = 1250 kA/m  and  MPL = 1232 kA/m.  A  MFL = 1209 kA/m  was  estimated  for  the  FL, 
presuming  a  0.6  nm-thick  magnetic  dead  layer,  which  is  a  typical  value  found  for  the 
MgO/FeCoB/Ta free layer37. 

Figure 1. Magnetostatic curve of an MTJ with tFL = 2 nm, for a magnetic field applied in plane, opposite to the exchange-bias field 
(œïH = 180¬∞). Blue squares are experimental results, and the red line is a fit to the experiment following equation (1). The numbers in 
parentheses identify the different magnetization configurations in the MTJ, also depicted in the figure. Inset: sketch of the magnetic 
tunnel junction stack structure. 

The interlayer exchange coupling field, Œº0HIEC, is the field required to compensate the IEC when 
going from configuration (3) to configuration (4) in figure 1. JIEC is thus determined as: 

JIEC = Œº0HIEC

MRLtRLMPLtPL
MRLtRL+MPLtPL

.  

(3) 

Conversely, to achieve saturation at positive values of H, MPL must rotate from configuration (2) 
to  an  unfavorable  direction,  parallel  to  MRL  and  antiparallel  to  the  exchange-bias  field 
(configuration (1)). As a result, both the IEC and the exchange-bias coupling must be overcome 
by 
field  
which 
Œº0Hcoupling = Œº0(HEB + |HIEC|).  JEB is then calculated as

The  mean  values  of  the  coupling  constants  for  the  four  wafers  were  JEB  =  0.459 mJ/m2  and 
JIEC =   ‚àí 0.797 mJ/m2. The value of JIEC is in accordance with that expected for the second peak 
of  the  oscillatory  JIEC(tRu)  found  for  a  0.8  nm-thick  Ru  spacer38.  Regarding  a  magnetostatic 
coupling  between  the  FL  and  the  RL,  a  field  offset  of  ‚àí0.2 mT  was  registered  in 
magnetoresistance  loops  (see  SM4  in  the  Supplemental  Material),  which  corresponds  to  a 
JN√©el <  2 √ó 10‚àí4 mJ/m2. 

A simulated M(H) curve, resulting from the minimization of the energy of equation (1), was 
fitted to the experiment. The model, based on macrospin approximation, cannot fully account for 
the hysteresis loop separating the configurations (1) and (2) in figure 1. The hysteresis is likely a 
result of a different effective JEB value depending on whether H is decreased or increased after 
depinning of magnetic domains. The varying JEB could then be explained by a non-entirely pinned 
domain  structure  at  the  IrMn/PL  system.  Then,  if  the  rotation  of  MPL  is  accompanied  by 
expansion/contraction of domains, it will not be successfully reproduced by a macrospin model. 
Furthermore,  small  in-plane  magnetic  anisotropies,  likely  to  be  present  in  the  RL  and  PL,  will 
influence the shape of the loop and were not accounted for in the model. Aside from that limitation, 
the parameters of the fit (areal magnetization and the EB and IEC constants) agree with those 
obtained directly from the experimental curve, indicating the general adequacy of the model to 
describe the MTJ system. 

The magnetic characterization of the pristine MTJs is completed by discussing the FMR 
results. Figure 2 contains the out-of-plane angular dependences of the FL‚Äôs resonance field and 
the  corresponding fits  to  the  data.  The FL  is  in-plane magnetized  for  all tFL,  as  seen  from  the 
symmetry of the angular dependence, with a minimum (maximum) of BRES at œïB  =  0¬∞ (œïB = 90¬∞). 
The in-plane magnetization reveals the leading role of the shape anisotropy, which results in a 
FL < 0, ranging from ‚àí0.42 T for tFL = 1.6 nm to ‚àí1.07 T for tFL = 2.0 nm (inset of Figure 2). 
BK1eff
Introducing a second-order anisotropy field, BK2, did not significantly improve the quality 
of the fits of BRES(œïB). Thus, for the purpose of extracting BK1eff
 we considered BK2 ‚âà 0. Such a 
second-order  contribution  to  the  anisotropy  in  multilayers  containing  FeCoB/MgO  interfaces 
originates 
interfacial 
perpendicular  magnetic  anisotropy)  across  grains  and  the  grain-grain  exchange  coupling.  As 
discussed in Ref.27, BK2 vanishes when the grains are either uncoupled or  when the intergrain 
exchange is very strong. As it will be shown below, the angular dependences of the linewidth, 
‚àÜBPP(œïB), for the FL of our MTJ reveal a small inhomogeneous broadening, mostly caused by 
two-magnon scattering (i.e. strongly coupled inhomogeneities). That evidence suggests the FL

film to be continuous, which is consistent with a BK2 that is much smaller than the (large) BK1eff

Additional resonances were observed by FMR, as shown in the top panel of figure 3(a), 
for ùêÅ parallel to the exchange-bias direction (œïB = 0¬∞). The additional FMR line is overlapped with 
that of the FL for tFL = 2.0 nm, but becomes resolved for the MTJs with thinner FLs. The position 
of the unveiled line (around 75 mT) is independent of tFL. The bottom panels of figure 3 contain 
simulated FMR spectra. A qualitative comparison between experiment and simulation allows the 
additional FMR line to be identified as stemming from the acoustic mode of the SAF, which is 
labeled as SAF-AM1. Indeed, the simulation indicates that the acoustic mode of the SAF crosses 
the  fixed  microwave  frequency  4  times  (see  SM3  in  the  Supplemental  Material),  resulting  in  4 
resonances labeled SAF-AM1 through SAF-AM4. Experimentally, for œïB =  0¬∞ it was only possible 
to  detect  SAF-AM1  and  SAF-AM2.  The  two  other  modes,  SAF-AM3  and  SAF-AM4,  were  not 
detected.  They  originate  absorption  features  with  an  intensity  lower  than  SAF-AM1  and  occur 
within the field range where the direction of MRL (and, through the effect of the IEC, MPL) rotates 
(see M(H) in figure 1 for H < 0). Hence, the undetected modes occur in a non-saturated magnetic 
state,  which  could  contribute  to  an  inhomogeneous  broadening  of  the  absorption  curves  and 
explain why those modes were not detected. The simulated intensity of the SAF modes for œïB =
180¬∞ (bottom panel of figure 3(b)) is nearly half of that obtained for œïB = 0¬∞. Furthermore, in this 
geometry, SAF-AM modes occur in the non-saturated FMR regime (see M(H) in figure 1 for H >
0). Those reasons may explain why the SAF-AM modes are not detected at all for œïB = 180¬∞ (top 
panel of figure 3(b)).

The  TMR  increased  from  127%  for  tFL = 1.6 nm  to  193%  for  tFL = 2.0 nm,  following  a 
decrease of the resistance of the parallel state, RP, while the RA product decreased from 43 Œ©ùúáùëö2 
to 36 Œ©ùúáùëö2 (see SM4 in the Supplemental Material). Those tendencies suggest that the crystalline 
quality  of  the  MgO  barrier  improves  with  increasing  tFL.  Ta  diffusion  is  known  to  hinder  the 
coherent crystallization of FeCo/MgO required for the symmetry spin-filtering effect. One may thus 
expect that, the thicker the FL, the lower the concentration of the Ta diffused to the vicinity of the 
FeCo/MgO interface, yielding the observed improvement of TMR. For the same reason, one can 
expect also a slight improvement in MS near the MgO interface since Ta gets farther from it with 
increased thickness of the free layer.

Stack properties after irradiation 

The irradiation of the MTJ with tFL = 2.0 nm produced a small decrease in the total magnetization 
of the stack and of the coupling fields up to a fluence of 3 √ó 1013 cm‚àí2, as seen in the VSM results 
of figure 4(a). In contrast, the irradiation with Œ¶ > 1014 cm‚àí2 resulted in a significant change in the 
shape of the magnetization curve, characterized by a decrease in the total MS accompanied by a 
decrease  of  both  coupling  fields  down  to  Œº0HIEC  ‚âà  0.1 T  and Œº0HEB ‚âà 0.05 T.  Ultimately,  for  a 
Œ¶ = 1015 cm‚àí2, a single switching event for the whole MTJ is observed at H ‚âà 0. The decrease 
in the coupling energies with increasing irradiation fluence is presented in figure 4 (b). 

Figure 4. (a) Magnetostatic curve of Ar+ irradiated MTJs with a tFL = 2 nm. (b) Dependence of the coupling energies, JEB and JIEC, on 
the ion irradiation fluence. 

With increasing irradiation fluence, the resonance field of the FL‚Äôs FMR spectra increased 
(decreased) for an in-plane (out-of-plane) applied magnetic field as shown in figure 5, where, for 
each Œ¶, the field axis was normalized by the resonance field of the FL in the corresponding pristine 
non‚àíirrad.  That  was  done  in  order  to  account  for  the  (small)  variability  of  anisotropy 
sample,  B0
between different pieces of the wafer. The progression of the FL‚Äôs peak position is consistent with 
a decrease in the magnitude of BK1eff
, i.e. the anisotropy keeping the magnetization in plane is 
reduced by increasing fluence. Indeed, as figure 6(a) shows, the anisotropy field after irradiation, 
relative  to  the  anisotropy  of  the  pristine  sample,  BK1eff
,  follows  an  exponential  decay 
(please note the logarithmic scale of the x-axis). The characteristic fluence of the decay is of about 
1014 cm‚àí2 for the MTJ with tFL = 2.0 nm, and it decreases for the thinner layers. In other words, 
the irradiation-induced modulation of the magnetic anisotropy is more pronounced for the thinner 
layers. The characteristic Œ¶ is also evident in the spectra of figure 5: the shift in resonance field 
becomes  more  pronounced  and  the  amplitude  of  the  FMR  line  gets  much  smaller  above 
1014 cm‚àí2.

It is interesting to note that the evolution of the anisotropy with increasing fluence for a FL 
composed of MgO/FeCoB/Ta occurs with an opposite trend to that observed for a double-MgO 
free  layer,  MgO/FeCoB/MgO,  as  seen  in  Ref.23.  The  difference  is  explained  by  the  distinct 
surroundings  of  the  FeCoB  layers.  In  the  double-MgO  layer,  ion-induced  intermixing  of  the 
FeCoB/MgO  interface  produces  a more  rapid  decrease of  ks1  than of MS,  resulting  in a  BK1eff
evolving into the negative values. Consequently, in double-MgO free layers, with increasing ion 
fluence, it is possible to reorient the magnetization from easy axis to easy cone and then to easy 
plane23. In contrast, in a Ta-capped free layer, the ion irradiation promotes a stronger decrease 
of MS due to intermixing at the top FL/Ta interface than of ks1 at the MgO/FeCoB and, thus, BK1eff
evolves in the direction of positive values, as schematized in figure 6 (b).

By  extrapolating  the  trend  observed for the  anisotropy  of the  Ta-capped  free  layer,  the 
easy-cone anisotropy is expected to be reached by irradiating an initially in-plane magnetized film 
(see figure 6(b)). Yet, in the MgO/FeCoB/Ta multilayers investigated here, the easy cone was not

attained (at room temperature) with increasing ion fluence. There are at least two reasons for that: 
First, BK2 in these Ta-capped films is smaller in comparison with the double-MgO free layers of 
Ref. 23, as discussed above. Starting with a smaller |BK2| restricts the range of BK1eff values for 
which  the  easy  cone can  be  obtained.  Secondly,  in  Ta-capped films,  the  physical  mechanism 
behind the modulation of anisotropy is also at the basis of the loss of ferromagnetic order: MS is 
decreased following the intermixing at the FL/Ta interface. Nonetheless, the temperature can be 
explored to reach the easy cone, taking advantage of the fact that, upon cooling, BK1eff is expected 
to increase into the positive range and |BK2| to scale with (BK1eff)2, as pointed out in Ref.28. Thus, 
starting with the multilayer irradiated with 1015 cm‚àí2, which exhibits a BK1eff ‚âà 0 (see figure 6(a)), 
i.e. near the crossover from in-plane to easy-axis anisotropy, and decreasing the temperature to 
150 K, the easy cone could be reached, as presented in figure 7. For future developments of the 
ion-irradiation-induced easy-cone anisotropy in single-MgO free layers, the exploration of different 
elements to be used as capping is of potential interest. For instance, replacing the capping of Ta 
by W, one can expect a smaller decrease of MS upon ion irradiation, due to a smaller degree of 
intermixing  at the  FL/W than  at the  FL/Ta  interface.  Those  differences may  be  explained by a 
different  miscibility  of  W  and  of  Ta  in  FeCo  (see,  e.g.  Ref.39).  Indeed,  in  the  double-MgO  free 
layers having those elements as spacers (see Ref. 23), one and the same ion fluence produced a 
change  in  the  easy-cone  angle  in  the  FL  with  a  W  spacer,  whereas  it  leads  to  a  complete 
reorientation of the magnetization direction from easy axis to easy cone and then to easy plane 
in the FL with a Ta spacer.

in orange and minima in black. The red dashed line marks the approximate resonance field of the FL, while the white dashed line 
indicates  the  peak  position  of  the  ferromagnetically  coupled  reference  layer  and  pinned  layer  (RL+PL)  due  to  irradiation-induced 
intermixing of the SAF (see discussion in the text and figures below). 

The effects of the ion irradiation on the layers composing the SAF were also evaluated in 
a  qualitative  manner.  In figure  5(c)  it  can  be  seen  that,  below  1014 cm‚àí2,  the  SAF-AM1  mode 
shifts to lower fields with increasing fluence. That shift is attributed to the initially small decrease 
in JEB (see figure 4(b)), according to simulations (SM5 in the Supplemental Material).

For fluences higher than 1014 cm‚àí2, JEB and JIEC get vanishingly small, and consequently 
the magnetic configuration typical of a SAF is no longer maintained: the PL becomes decoupled 
from the IrMn antiferromagnet, and the antiferromagnetic-like IEC between RL and PL is lost. In 
fact,  above  2 √ó 1014 cm‚àí2  it  is  reasonable  to  presume  that  the  RL  and  PL  become 
ferromagnetically coupled and behave as a single, thicker ferromagnetic layer. The loss of the 
exchange bias and a ferromagnetic coupling between RL and PL explain the appearance of only 
one additional FMR line in figure 5(a, c). 

Figure 8. Angular dependences of the resonance fields measured for MTJs irradiated with: (a) Œ¶ = 1013 cm‚àí2; (b) Œ¶ =  5 √ó 1014 cm‚àí2; 
(c) Œ¶ = 1015 cm‚àí2; and (d)  Œ¶ = 5 √ó 1015 cm‚àí2. The color code represents the amplitude of the positive peak of the FMR intensity, 
dœá‚Ä≤‚Ä≤/dB, in arbitrary units. Dotted lines indicate the evolution of BRES(œïB) for the cases of the FL (red), SAF-AM1 (pink) and RL+PL 
(white). 

The  angular  dependences  of  the  resonance  field  presented  in  figure 8  summarize  the 
referred  events  that  take  place  with  increasing  fluence.  In  the  low-fluence  range,  as  at  Œ¶ =
1013 cm‚àí2 (figure 8(a)), the anisotropy field of the FL is nearly the same as the one in the pristine 
MTJ, and a resonance identified as SAF-AM1 is observed for œïB < 90¬∞. In the high-fluence range, 
FL
namely at Œ¶ = 5 √ó 1014 cm‚àí2 (figure 8(b)), the BK1eff
 drops below 50% of the corresponding value 
for the pristine sample. Additionally, a resonance having an angular dependence that reflects a 
BK1eff < 0 becomes apparent. That anisotropy field is stronger in magnitude than the one of the 
FL, i.e. |BK1eff| > |BK1eff
|, as indicated by a peak position that surpasses the experimental field 
range  around  œïB = 90¬∞.  The  high  effective  magnetic  moment  associated  with  that  strong 
anisotropy is likely to be a result of the ferromagnetic coupling between the PL and the RL. That 
coupling probably occurs due to the ion-induced intermixing of the PL/Ru/RL interfaces, which 
reduces the effective thickness of the Ru spacer. However, it is not clear whether the effective tRu 
decreases towards a value where JIEC becomes positive or if the intermixing occurs to an extent 
where direct interfacial exchange coupling between RL and PL is promoted. After irradiation with 
Œ¶ = 1015 cm‚àí2  (figure  8(c)),  the  FL  gets  practically  magnetically  isotropic,  with  the  resonance 
occurring  at  the  field  value  corresponding  to  g  ‚âà  2,  which  is  indicative  of  the  onset  of  a

ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition in that layer. Ultimately, at 5 √ó 1015 cm‚àí2 (figure 8(d)), the 
FL absorption is no longer observed, and BK1eff of the FM-coupled RL and PL decreases. 

The results also show in a qualitative manner that, apart from the coupling energies, the 
magnetic  properties  of  the  SAF  are  more  robust  to  the  irradiation  than  those  of  the  FL:  the 
decrease in FMR line intensity and in BK1eff happens at higher fluences for the layers composing 
the SAF than for the FL. Considering the high energy of the incident ions and the small spatial 
separation between FL and SAF (they are separated only by a 1.5 nm MgO barrier), the energy 
density deposited in the SAF is practically identical to that deposited in the FL. The different extent 
of  irradiation-produced  effects  in  the  two  layers  is  thus  rather  explained  by  their  distinct  layer 
surroundings: the (thinner) FL is in contact with a thick Ta capping layer, while the (thicker) SAF 
is enclosed between the MgO barrier and the IrMn layer, only interrupted by a thin Ru spacer. A 
lower average threshold displacement energy of Ta than of Ru (Ref.40) may favor a higher degree 
of  intermixing  at  the  FL/Ta  than  at  the  PL/Ru/RL  interfaces.  Furthermore,  the  higher  effective 
thickness  of  the  RL+PL  system  should  also  contribute  to  the  preservation  of  the  FMR  peak 
intensity up to higher fluences (see figure 8(d)). The intermixing of the layers upon ion irradiation 
is qualitatively corroborated by XRR results (SM6 of the Supplemental Material). 

The characteristic fluence of 1014 cm‚àí2, seen in the VSM and FMR results, is reflected 
also in the electrical properties of the irradiated MTJs. Below 1014 cm‚àí2, the TMR drops down to 
a value of 74% at ÔÅÜ  = 3 √ó 1013 cm‚àí2, following the decrease in the resistance of the antiparallel 
state, RAP (figure 9). The intermixing at the MgO/FeCoB interfaces cannot explain that initial loss 
of TMR, since the resistance of the parallel state, RP, and BK1eff
 remain practically unchanged up 
to ÔÅÜ  = 3 √ó 1013 cm‚àí2. A possibility is instead the creation of defects within the MgO barrier. Those 
defects  may constitute  an  additional  electron  tunneling  channel,  characterized  by  a  resistance 
0 , 
RD. If the magnitude of RD is comparable to the resistance of the pristine MTJ in the AP state, RAP
0  and RD. On 
then RAP will decrease after irradiation as a result of the parallel connection of RAP
0 .  Above 
the  other  hand,  the  RP  value  would  remain  practically  unchanged  as  long as  RD ‚â´ RP
ÔÅÜ  = 1014 cm‚àí2, the magnetization of the RL is no longer pinned due to the loss of the magnetic 
coupling, resulting in an undefined antiparallel state, as seen by the emergence of two loops in 
the  R(H)  curve.  Additionally,  RP  is  significantly  decreased,  suggesting  an  irradiation-induced 
deterioration  of  the  crystallinity  of  the  MgO  barrier  and  of  the  MgO/FeCoB  interfaces.  At 
1015 cm‚àí2, the R(H) dependence becomes flat and the TMR goes to zero.

line indicates the TMR of the pristine MTJ stack, at a value of 193%. 

At last, the impact of the irradiation on the magnetization dynamics was analyzed by fitting 
the  angular  dependence  of  the  FMR  linewidth,  (‚àÜBPP(œïB)  -  see  figure 10),  with  a  model 
comprising  the  intrinsic  broadening  and  the  inhomogeneous  broadening  caused  by  fluctuating 
anisotropy and two-magnon scattering. For the cases of pristine MTJ and low-fluence irradiation 
(figure 10(a)) the model adequately describes the experimental results, confirming the intrinsic 
damping as the dominant contribution to the line broadening. For fluences higher than 1014 cm‚àí2 
(figure 10(b)), the shape of the ‚àÜBPP(œïB) evidences the increase in inhomogeneous broadening, 
as  one  would  expect  for  a  significantly  damaged  magnetic  layer.  Furthermore,  the  model  no 
longer  produces  a  satisfactory  fit  to  the  data,  reason  why  the  damping  parameters  are  not 
extracted  for  fluences  above  1014 cm‚àí2.  The  inadequacy  of  the  model  may  be  linked  to  an 
increase in JN√©el, with the coupling between FL and RL leading to a distorted angular dependence 
of the linewidth in a way that is not predicted by the model. 

Interestingly, different damping constants are found whether the projection of the field on 
the MTJ plane is parallel (œïB = 0¬∞) or antiparallel (œïB = 180¬∞) to the exchange-bias direction. In 
other words, there is a linewidth asymmetry about œïB = 90¬∞. The fit to ‚àÜBPP(œïB) thus yields two 
different  damping  values:  Œ±  for  œïB > 90¬∞  and  Œ±‚Ä≤  for  œïB < 90¬∞,  with  Œ±‚Ä≤ > Œ±.  The  linewidth 
asymmetry  is  quantified  through the  ratio  ‚àÜBPP(œïB = 0¬∞)/‚àÜBPP(œïB = 180¬∞)  and plotted  against 
the ion fluence in figure 11(a). The asymmetry exists already in the non-irradiated stack and then 
increases with the fluence, peaking at 1013 cm‚àí2, before disappearing above 1014 cm‚àí2. Figure 
11(b) shows the changes in the damping constants, relative to the value obtained for each sample 
before irradiation, i.e. Œ±(Œ¶) ‚àí Œ±(0). No clear dependence of Œ± on the irradiation fluence is found, 
i.e. Œ± is not significantly impacted by the irradiation at low fluences (Œ¶B < 1014 cm‚àí2). On the other 
hand, the change in Œ±‚Ä≤ peaks at Œ¶B =  1013, in correlation with the linewidth asymmetry.

One potential explanation for the linewidth asymmetry would be the hybridization of the 
FMR modes, whereby, through the N√©el coupling, the resonance in the FL would be perturbed by 
the resonance  in the  SAF.  The  degree  of  hybridization  and the  corresponding  line  broadening 
would then depend on the different magnetic configurations of the MTJ (either P or AP) due to 
the different separation between the resonances in the FL and in the SAF. In our case, JN√©el is 
rather  small  (JN√©el < 2 √ó 10‚àí4 mJ/m2)  and  for  fluences  below  1014 cm‚àí2  the  effective  N√©el 
coupling  field acting on  the  FL  does not change,  as revealed  by the  constant shift  of the  FL‚Äôs 
hysteresis loop seen in the VSM and CIPT results (e.g. figure 9). A simulation of the absorption 
curves (SM7 of the Supplemental Material) confirmed the JN√©el value to be insufficient to account 
for the linewidth asymmetry.  

Notably,  the  higher  damping,  Œ±‚Ä≤,  is  measured  for  the  AP  state  of  the  MTJ,  whose 
resistance  decreases  with  increasing  fluence  (see  figure  9).  Furthermore,  for  fluences  above 
1013 cm‚àí2, the linewidth asymmetry, that is correlated with Œ±‚Ä≤, starts to decrease until it completely 
disappears around 1014 cm‚àí2. That decrease in the linewidth asymmetry can be ascribed to the 
fact  that  the  AP  state  of  the  MTJ  is  no  longer  maintained  at  the  magnetic  fields for  which  the 
resonance  occurs  (see  e.g.  loss  of  AP  configuration  above  4  mT  for  a  œï = 2 √ó 1014 cm‚àí2 
irradiated stack in figure 9). The correlation between linewidth asymmetry, magnetic configuration 
of the MTJ and resistance suggests that a spin pumping effect is at play, contributing to the value 
of Œ±‚Ä≤. In that case, Œ±‚Ä≤ = Œ± + Œ±SP, yielding a spin-pumping contribution of Œ±SP =  0.0091, for the MTJ 
irradiated  with  1013 cm‚àí2.  That  would  correspond 
to  a  spin  mixing  conductance, 
G‚Üë‚Üì =  
Œ±SP ‚âà  1015 cm‚àí2. The order of magnitude of the estimated G‚Üë‚Üì is typical of metallic 
interfaces34  and  thus  unreasonably  high  for  the  case  of  an  MgO  barrier,  which  is  expected  to 
partially  suppress  spin  pumping41.  We  tentatively  attribute  the  estimated  G‚Üë‚Üì  to  an  anisotropic 
spin-pumping at the FL/Ta interface. That anisotropic source of damping from the FL/Ta interface 
would depend on the spin currents being emitted across the MgO barrier, which in turn depends 
on  the  magnetic  configuration  of  the  MTJ  and  on  its  electrical  resistance,  both  of  which  are 
impacted  by  the  irradiation.  The  exact  mechanism  at  the  basis  of  such  an  anisotropic  spin-
pumping is, however, not understood and will required further investigation.

Conclusions 

09/04/2020 

Combining  FMR,  VSM  and  CIPT  techniques,  the  effects  of  400  keV  Ar+  ion  irradiation  on  the 
magnetic and electrical properties of MTJ stacks were tracked. A correlation was found between 
the fluence-dependent changes in magnetic anisotropy, coupling energies, TMR and damping, 
which allowed to distinguish between two irradiation regimes. 

In the  low-fluence  regime,  Œ¶ < 1014 cm‚àí2,  there  is  a  weak  modulation  of  the  free-layer 
anisotropy due to a decrease in MS, and there is a continuous decrease of the TMR down to about 
70% at Œ¶ = 3 √ó 1013 cm‚àí2. The drop in TMR is due to a decrease in RAP, likely caused by the 
creation of defects inside the MgO barrier, which act as spin-independent tunneling channels in 
parallel with the spin-dependent one. The interlayer exchange coupling and the exchange bias 
decrease  slightly,  but  the  SAF  magnetic  structure  is  preserved.  No  significant  changes  in  the 
magnetization damping are observed. 

In the high-fluence regime, Œ¶ > 1014 cm‚àí2, the modulation of the free-layer anisotropy is 
strong. It is caused by a strong decrease in MS, likely due to a high degree of elemental intermixing 
at the FL/Ta interface. Ultimately, irradiation at fluences around Œ¶  =  1015 cm‚àí2 renders the FL 
paramagnetic. The intermixing of the PL/Ru/RL and of the IrMn/PL interfaces results in a loss of 
JEB  and  of  JIEC.  As  a  consequence,  the  magnetization  of  the  RL  is  no  longer  pinned  and  the 
antiparallel state of the MTJ cannot be maintained. The TMR vanishes due to the damaged MgO 
barrier and MgO/FeCoB interfaces. 

The results show, through the various parameters relevant to MTJ applications, that there 
is a window of operation in what concerns the use of ion irradiation for the tailoring of magnetic 
anisotropy. For the ion energy and mass used in this study and for the typical thicknesses found 
in MTJ stacks, that window is limited by a characteristic fluence of the order of 1014 cm‚àí2. Below 
that fluence, small changes in anisotropy can be induced at the cost of negatively impacting other 
interface-controlled parameters of the MTJ, namely TMR, but still keeping a functional MTJ. On 
the contrary, above that fluence the MTJ is rendered inoperative. 

It  was  further  demonstrated  that  the  layers  surrounding  the  magnetic  free  layer  play  a 
decisive  role  in  determining  the  trend  of  the  ion-irradiation-induced  magnetic  anisotropy 
modulation. If a FeCoB layer is sandwiched between two MgO layers (double-MgO), intermixing 
at the interfaces promotes a decrease in interfacial PMA (Ref.23) that leads to a reorientation of 
magnetization in the direction from perpendicular easy axis to easy cone and then to easy plane 
with  increasing  ion  fluence.  On  the  contrary,  if  the  FeCoB  is  capped  by  a  metal  such  as  Ta, 
intermixing  at  the  FeCoB/Ta  interface  reduces  the  effective  magnetization  and  can  promote  a 
reorientation from easy plane to easy cone or even easy axis. However, there seems to be a fine 
balance between decreasing MS by a sizeable amount to induce those reorientations but not too 
much as to lose ferromagnetic order. The use of alternative capping materials, such as W, which 
are  less  prone  to  diffuse  through  FeCo,  is  suggested  for  future  research regarding  anisotropy 
modulation via ion irradiation.

SM1. Simulation of ion irradiation of MTJ 

The simulations were carried using the TRIM (Transport and Range of Ions in Matter) software31. 
In the simulations the multilayer stack is assumed to be at 0 K, which means there is no thermal 
diffusion of atoms or the self-annealing typical of metals. Also, there is no build-up of damage, 
meaning that each ion sees a pristine target. This leads to an underestimation of the produced 
damage. Moreover, the crystalline structure is not considered in the simulations. Nevertheless, 
the assumptions are not expected to significantly impact the (qualitative) goal of the simulations 
which was to guarantee that the Ar+ ions are implanted inside the Si substrate (figure S1), whereas 
elastic  and  inelastic  interactions  occur  within  the  multilayers,  with  expected  intermixing  of 
elements  across  the  interfaces  (figure  S2).  As  seen  in  figure  S1,  at  400  keV  the  peak  of  Ar+ 
implantation  is  located  well  inside  the  Si  substrate.  For  a  fluence  of  1014 cm‚àí2,  the  volume 
concentration of Ar+ inside the multilayer stack is smaller than 6 √ó 1017 Ar+ ‚àô cm‚àí3, i.e. 5 orders 
of magnitude smaller than the atomic density of the elements comprising the layers. 

Figure S1. Simulated concentration profile of Ar+ ions, normalized by the ion fluence, [Ar+]/Œ¶, as a function of depth in the MTJ stack 
deposited on Si substrate for different ion energies: 100 keV (black squares); 200 keV (red dots); 300 keV (green up triangles) and 
400 keV (blue down triangles). Solid lines are guides-to-the-eye of the ion range distribution. The vertical line indicates the depth 
corresponding to the substrate surface. The concentration of implanted Ar+ at each depth can be obtained by multiplying the respective 
y-axis value by the ion fluence Œ¶.  

The  changes  in  the  element  concentration  profiles,  in  units  of  percentage  per  fluence 
(%Œ¶- 1), were also calculated, assuming a regime of linear mixing. In that regime, the probability

of  the  same  atom  to  be  recoiled  twice  is  negligible.  Within  that  assumption,  the  change  in 
concentration of the elements of the stack after the irradiation is simply the difference between 
the number of atoms recoiled into vacancies (r) and the created vacancies (v). After irradiation 
with a fluence Œ¶,  the  percentual  composition  variation,  in  a  given  layer  of atomic  density  œÅ,  is 
calculated as: 

Concentration changes = 100 Œ¶

(r ‚àí v)
œÅ

 . 

(1) 

The  expected  composition  variations  are  shown  in  figure  S2,  with  positive  (negative)  values 
representing the accumulation (depletion) of elements relative to the pristine sample. According 
to  the  simulations,  concentration  changes  of  the  order  of  a  few  per  cent  are  expected  for  a 
1014 cm‚àí2 fluence.

SM2.  Estimate  of  magnetic  parameters  from  vibrating  sample  magnetometry 
results 

The mean values of each plateau (respectively Mt1, Mt2 and Mt3) of figure S3 (a) were used to 
estimate the areal magnetization of each layer, by solving the following system of equations:

(2) 

The solutions to equation 2 are shown in figure S3 (b), as a function of the free-layer thickness. 
As expected, MRLtRL and MPLtPL show no dependence on tFL. Assuming the nominal values of 
tRL  and  tPL,  i.e.  considering there  is  no  magnetic dead  layer  in RL and PL, the  magnetization 
saturation values are estimated to be 1250 kA/m and 1232 kA/m, respectively. Also as expected, 
MFLtFL evolves linearly with tFL. As the stack measured in VSM was cut from a wafer, the sample 
area could not be determined with a sufficient accuracy to precisely determine the magnetic dead 
layer thickness of the FL (i.e. tFL yielding M √ó t = 0 in figure S3 (b)). Indeed, assuming a (modest) 
uncertainty of 10% in the sample area, the magnetic dead layer thus calculated would fall within 
a broad interval: 0.4 < tdead < 1.4 nm. Presuming a tdead = 0.6 nm, which is a typical value found 
in literature for the MgO/FeCoB/Ta free layer 37, a MFL = 1209 kA/m is estimated.

SM3. FMR modes for a magnetic tunnel junction 

Figure S4 shows simulation results for the case of an external field applied along the exchange-
bias direction (along the x axis) of the MTJ. The parameters of the simulations are included in the 
figure caption. The first panel contains the magnetostatic curve, obtained from the projection of 
ùêåùê¢ = MSiùê¶ùê¢ onto ùêÅ. Two configurations are found at the plateaus of the M(B) curve: the saturation 
of all layers along B at high fields (1), and the antiparallel state of the MTJ (2). The rotation of MRL 
starts at B ‚âà 0.5 T, the point at which minimization of IEC energy, rather than minimization of the 
Zeeman energy, brings about a greater reduction in the magnetic energy density. As JIEC > JEB, it 
is energetically favourable for MPL to be ‚Äúdragged‚Äù along (in the opposite direction) by the rotating 
MRL. Figure S4 (c) shows how MPL rotates in the sample plane out of the x-axis by up to 45¬∫ (at 
a field of 0.25 T) before rotating back to its original position. 

The FMR modes are shown in the second panel of Figure S4 (a). The FL, under the effect 
of a vanishingly small JN√©el, presents the f(B) dependence typical of the Kittel equation. In contrast, 
the dynamical responses of MRL and MPL are strongly coupled by the IEC, to the extent that it is 
only meaningful to speak about the dynamics of the whole SAF. The FMR response of the SAF 
is then described by two normal modes: the acoustic mode, AM, of the lower-frequency and in-
phase  precession  of  the  magnetic  moments  in  each  layer;  and  the  optical-mode,  OM,  of  the 
higher-frequency  and  out-of-phase  precession.  The  experimental  frequency  f0,  included  in the 
figure as a dashed line, crosses the SAF-AM four times and the FL mode once, at specific field 
values  ‚Äì  the  resonance  fields, BRES.  The  field  derivate  of  Im(œáÃÉ),  included  in  the  third  panel  of 
Figure  S4 (a),  constitutes  a  simulated  FMR  spectrum,  with the  absorption  lines  centred  in the 
same BRES values determined through the SB formalism.

SM4. Magnetoresistance loops of pristine MTJ 

The R(H) loops obtained by CIPT technique for pristine MTJs are shown in figure S5. The parallel 
(antiparallel) state with a low (high) resistance is observed at the positive (negative) values of H. 
RP and RAP of figure S5 (a) thus correspond, respectively, to the magnetic configurations (2) and 
(3) of figure S3 (a). The center of the R(H) loop is offset by approximately ‚àí0.2 mT, indicating a 
JN√©el < 2 √ó 10‚àí4 mJ/m2.

in the experiment.

SM6. X-Ray Reflectivity 

The normalized XRR profile for the case of pristine and irradiated MTJ is presented in figure S7 
(a). The position of the interference Kiessig fringes is practically unchanged upon ion irradiation, 
suggesting the thickness of the layers is not significantly changed. The irradiated MTJs exhibit, 
however,  a faster  decay  of  the  whole  reflectivity  profile  with  the  increasing  angle  as  well  as  a 
decrease  in  intensity  of  the  Kiessig  fringes,  both  effects  suggesting  an  increased  interface 
roughness following the increasing ion fluence. We do not make a quantitative assessment of the 
XRR results, considering the difficulty in satisfactorily fitting all the fringes in the reflection profile. 
That difficulty mostly arises from the complexity of the multilayer stack, regarding the number of 
layer/interfaces, which only gets more complex after ion irradiation. The scattering length density, 
SLD, (scattering power of the material which increases with the electron density) profile of figure 
S7  (b)  resulted  from  the  best  fits  to  the  data  of  figure  S7  (a).  The  changes  in  SLD  suggest 
intermixing  of  the  interfaces,  although  no  clear  conclusion  on  the  tendency  of  the  intermixing 
degree with the increasing ion fluence can be drawn.

SM7. Role of mode hybridization on the linewidth asymmetry 

The  simulation  presented  in  figure  S8  shows  how  the  peaks  of  microwave  absorption 
corresponding to the SAF (RL and PL) are overlapped with the resonance of the FL, for the case 
of the AP state of the MTJ (œïB = 0¬∞), but not for the P state (œïB = 180¬∞). It is thus expected that 
any  mode  hybridization  originated  by  JN√©el  may  impact  the  FMR  linewidth  differently  for  each 
orientation.  

The  value  of  JN√©el  was  increased  in  the  simulations,  and  the  linewidth  was  extracted  by fitting 
Lorentzian lineshape to the simulated absorption curves. It is seen (figure S9 (a)) that for JN√©el <
0.03 mJ/m2,  ‚àÜBPP  increase  less  than  1%.  Hence,  the  experimental  estimate  of  JN√©el ‚âà
2 √ó 10‚àí4 mJ/m2 cannot explain the linewidth asymmetry seen for the pristine MTJ (figure 11(a) of 
the main text). 

Afterwards, the evolution of the linewidth asymmetry with the increasing ion fluence was simulated 
(figure S9 (b)). JN√©el was kept fixed at 2 √ó 10‚àí4 mJ/m2, 2 √ó 10‚àí3mJ/m2 and 2 √ó 10‚àí2 mJ/m2, while 
the  magnetic  anisotropy  and  the  JEB  and  JIEC  were  varied  according  to  the  irradiation‚Äôs 
the 
experimental  results. 
experimentally  determined 
linewidth  asymmetry  and  that  a  value  as  high  as  JN√©el =
2 √ó 10‚àí2 mJ/m2  would  actually  result  in  a  decrease  in  ‚àÜBPP  for  œïB = 0¬∞,  up  to  a  fluence  of 
1014 cm‚àí2, an opposite effect to that observed in the experiment. 

that  JN√©el = 2 √ó 10‚àí4 mJ/m2  cannot  explain 

It  was  confirmed
