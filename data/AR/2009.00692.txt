ABSTRACT

Kepler observations revealed that hundreds of stars with near-solar fundamental parameters and
rotation periods have much stronger and more regular brightness variations than the Sun. Here we
identify one possible reason for the peculiar behaviour of these stars. Inspired by solar nests of activity,
we assume that the degree of inhomogeneity of active-region (AR) emergence on such stars is higher
than on the Sun. To test our hypothesis, we model stellar light curves by injecting ARs consisting of
spots and faculae on stellar surfaces at various rates and nesting patterns, using solar AR properties
and diﬀerential rotation. We show that a moderate increase of the emergence frequency from the
solar value combined with the increase of the degree of nesting can explain the full range of observed
amplitudes of variability of Sun-like stars with nearly the solar rotation period. Furthermore, nesting in
the form of active longitudes, in which ARs tend to emerge in the vicinity of two longitudes separated
by 180◦, leads to highly regular, almost sine-like variability patterns, rather similar to those observed
in a number of solar-like stars.

1. INTRODUCTION

Rotational brightness variability of Sun-like stars re-
sults from the transit of stellar magnetic features, i.e.
dark spots and bright faculae, over the visible stellar
hemisphere. The advent of high-precision photometry
brought by planet-hunting missions allowed measuring
rotational variability for several hundred thousands of
stars (Reinhold et al. 2013; Walkowicz & Basri 2013;
Basri et al. 2013; McQuillan et al. 2014). It also took
solar-stellar connection studies to a new level, by allow-
ing solar variability to be compared with that of solar
peers.

Recently, Reinhold et al. (2020) (hereafter R20) identi-
ﬁed 2529 stars with near-solar fundamental parameters,
but with unknown rotation periods (hereafter, pseudoso-
lar stars) and 369 stars with near-solar rotation peri-
ods and near-solar fundamental parameters (hereafter,
solar-like stars). While many of the pseudosolar stars
are expected to have near-solar rotation periods, the
sample most probably also includes stars with diﬀer-
ent periods (in particular, stars rotating slower than
the Sun). The light curves of pseudosolar stars appear
rather irregular, often resembling the solar light curve,
and their variability amplitudes lie mostly within the
solar range. Consequently, the Sun appears to be a typ-
ical star belonging to the pseudosolar sample: it would
most probably be attributed to this sample if observed
by Kepler, owing to diﬃculties in determining its rota-
tion period).

Surprisingly, the variability pattern of solar-like stars
diﬀers from that of the pseudosolar stars and the Sun.
Firstly, R20 found that the mean variability in their

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Is¸ık et al.

solar-like sample was 5 times stronger than solar vari-
ability. Secondly, many of the stellar light curves had a
rather regular temporal proﬁle, often resembling a sine
wave. This is in stark contrast to the Sun, which has
a complex and quite irregular light curve. Especially at
periods of high magnetic activity the solar light curve
becomes so irregular that even the solar rotation period
cannot be determined correctly from photometry, us-
ing standard methods like the auto-correlation function
and Lomb-Scargle periodograms (see, e.g. Aigrain et al.
2015; Witzke et al. 2020; Amazo-G´omez et al. 2020).

We illustrate the diﬀerence between the variability of
the Sun and solar-like stars in Fig. 1, where we compare
the Kepler light curve of KIC 7019978 (Teﬀ = 5726 K,
Prot = 26.76 d) with that of the Sun during the maxi-
mum of Cycle 23. The solar light curve as it would be
observed in the Kepler passband has been taken from
N`emec et al. (2020). The strong dip in the solar light
curve (t∼ 2950 d) was caused by a rather unusual conﬁg-
uration of magnetic features on the solar surface: three
very large active regions (hereafter ARs) on one longi-
tudinal hemisphere (i.e., within a longitudinal extent of
180◦) had emerged contemporaneously, while the oppo-
site hemisphere remained free of ARs. Single dips of
such depths occur rarely the solar brightness variations.
The remaining shallower dips represent the typical eﬀect
of sunspot groups around activity maximum. The rota-
tional brightness modulation of KIC 7019978 is clearly
more vigorous and much more regular than that of the
Sun, which varies its brightness on a comparable level
only during the transit of that extraordinary concentra-
tion of three very large ARs.

All in all, the R20 study raised an intriguing ques-
tion: how can large-amplitude and regular light curves
of solar-like stars be produced and, in particular, what
is the diﬀerence between the surface magnetism of the
Sun and of solar-like stars? We introduce here two po-
tential hypotheses for explaining the diﬀerence between
the Sun and solar-like stars: (i) the surface coverage
of magnetic features is larger than typical solar levels,
leading to higher variability; (ii) the longitudinal distri-
bution of magnetic features is more clumpy than on the
Sun, leading to an ampliﬁcation of brightness variations
for a given level of magnetic ﬂux or activity.

The ﬁrst hypothesis is supported by the fact that solar
cycles can have diﬀerent strengths. For example, cycle
19 was stronger than Cycle 24 by a factor of three to
four in terms of the maximum average sunspot number.
One can speculate that the dynamos of solar-like stars
can produce cycles at a wider range of strengths than
those of the Sun, although it is a priori unclear why this
should be so.

Figure 1. Brightness variations of KIC 7019978 (top panel)
and of the Sun (middle panel), plotted on the same scale
of the vertical axis. The SOHO/MDI image (bottom panel)
corresponds to the time of the exceptionally strong dip in
the solar light curve above, around 2940 days. Note the con-
spicuous diﬀerences in shape and amplitude of the variations
of the two stars.

The second hypothesis is motivated by the tendency
of solar ARs to emerge into regions of recent mag-
netic ﬂux emergence, called complexes or nests of ac-
tivity (Gaizauskas et al. 1983; Castenmiller et al. 1986;
Brouwer & Zwaan 1990; Usoskin et al. 2005). The ex-
act physical mechanisms for AR nesting are as yet un-
clear. The weak rotational variability and the irregular
light variations of the Sun (and pseudosolar stars with
undetermined rotation periods) could be related to the
low degree of active-region nesting (e.g., only 40-50% of
sunspots are associated with nests, see Pojoga & Cudnik
2002). On solar-like stars with high variability and reg-
ular light curves, magnetic ﬂux emergence can be clus-
tered to higher degrees than on the Sun. The eﬀects
of AR nesting on photometric variability has not been
studied to date. Here we present a simple model that
quantiﬁes the eﬀects of nesting on photometric variabil-
ity of solar-like stars in the Kepler passband for a range
of magnetic activity levels.

2. METHOD

2.1. Modelling brightness variations

To simulate stellar light curves, we employ the model
developed by Shapiro et al. (2020a). We simulate bright-
ness variations of a solar-like star as observed equator-on
(inclination i = 90◦) for a period of 4.4 years (close to
Kepler ’s operation time) with a sampling rate of four
measurements per day. Diﬀerent activity levels are ob-
tained by letting diﬀerent numbers of ARs (consisting
of spot groups and faculae) emerge within the latitude
limits ±30◦, assuming a size distribution of ARs as on
the Sun (i.e., a log-normal function; Bogdan et al. 1988;
Baumann & Solanki 2005). The AR emergence fre-
quency depends on the activity level, but for a given
activity level it is constant in time, so that we do not
consider any systematic change in the activity level dur-
ing the simulated period. Following the approach of
Shapiro et al. (2020a), we use solar dependences of fac-
ular and spot disc coverages on the chromospheric S-
index (given by Eqs. 1–2 from Shapiro et al. 2014). We
thus quantify the activity level in terms of S, which is
taken as an average over the simulated time range. We
consider a linear (in time) decay law of active regions
and ﬁxed the ratio between the lifetime of facular and
spot parts of ARs to three. A more detailed description
of light-curve modelling is given in Appendix A.

To measure variability, we split the entire light curve
into 90-day segments (to be compatible with Kepler
quarters), calculate the peak-to-peak variability in each
of them, and take the mean value among the segments,

which we call R90. We consider peak-to-peak variabil-
ity instead of 95% to 5% diﬀerence often employed in
the literature (e.g., Basri et al. 2013, R20), because our
simulated light curves are free of noise.

2.2. Nesting active regions

To simulate nests of ARs, we consider two distinct
modes. In the free-nesting mode, clusters of magnetic
features form and decay sequentially. An active region
(AR) emerges either (a) in the vicinity of the previ-
ous emergence location with a ﬁxed probability p, or
(b) at a random location within the latitude range of
±30◦ with the remaining probability 1 − p. The proce-
dure is very similar to the one introduced by I¸sık et al.
(2018, see their Appendix C). The proximity of an AR’s
emergence location to the nest centre is drawn from a
two-dimensional Gaussian process with standard devia-
tions of 2◦ in latitude and 3◦ in longitude, which closely
represents the observational values given by Pojoga &
Cudnik (2002). The algorithm is designed in such a way
that multiple nests can form sequentially, not contempo-
raneously. This means that before all the members of a
given nest have fully emerged, a new nest does not begin
to form. The development of a nest is thus completed
when the subsequently emerging AR does not belong to
the nest. However, a new nest can start to form when
an existing nest (or nests) have not fully decayed, ow-
ing to size-dependent lifetimes of constituent spots and
faculae.

In the double-active-longitude (AL) mode, the proba-
bilistic procedure is the same as for the free-nest mode,

vertical thickness of each coloured band represents the ±1σ scatter in R90 for a set of 10 random realisations (for F100, 50
realisations were used). The standard deviation in S is of order 10−4. The black curves show the case of 100% nesting (F100
and A100), with 1σ levels shown by dashed curves. The inset depicts the part of the main plot indicated in the lower left corner

until now. The full and long-dashed horizontal lines mark the maximum and the mean variability in the solar-like sample of

upper limits of the rotational variability.

but ARs tend to emerge near one of the two ‘active’
longitudes separated by 180◦ (with equal probability).
The proximity of an AR to its host active-longitude is
set randomly, using a normal distribution with σ = 10◦
in longitude.

In both nesting modes we set the probability p of a
given AR to be associated to a nest (whether a free-nest
or AL) as a free parameter. In the following, we will use
the notations FP and AP , where the preﬁx describes
the nesting mode (F for free nesting and A for AL), and
P stands for the percentile probability of a given AR to
emerge as part of a nest.

In the free nesting case, the nest centres, as well as
ARs emerged inside or outside of nests follow the solar
surface diﬀerential rotation over latitude λ (Snodgrass
1983):

Ω(cid:48)(λ) = −2.3 sin2 λ − 1.62 sin4 λ degrees/day,

(1)

where Ω(cid:48) = Ω(λ) − Ω(0) is the rate at which spots drift
in longitude (in the equatorial rest-frame).

On the Sun, ALs are detected only in a dynam-
ical reference frame, synchronised with the latitude-
dependent rotation periods of major ﬂux emergence re-
gions (Usoskin et al. 2005). Even if we assume an ini-
tially coherent AL, diﬀerential rotation would destroy
this pattern in only a few stellar rotations. Taking a
rigid AL and applying diﬀerential rotation to individual
ARs on smaller scales would have only a minor eﬀect
on the variability. To keep our model simple, we thus
opted for rigid rotation in the AL mode, to compute

brightness variations for an extremely coherent mode of
nesting, because our goal is to assess the entire potential
variability range.

Figure 2 shows the locations and lifetimes of spot
groups for models F50, F90, and A50, for S= 0.182,
typical of a solar maximum. Longer lifetimes are asso-
ciated with larger spot groups, in agreement with the
Gnevyshev-Waldmeier rule of sunspot groups. From
F50 to F90 there is a dramatic increase in the degree of
clustering of spot groups, which is expected to amplify
photometric variability. Also the A50 case demonstrates
signiﬁcant clustering in longitude. In the F50 and F90
cases the diﬀerential rotation leads spot groups and free
nests to exhibit longitudinal drifts at rates depending
on the latitude (see, e.g., ¨Ozavcı et al. 2018).

3. RESULTS

3.1. Nesting ampliﬁes variability

We ﬁrst investigate the dependence of the photometric
variability on the level of magnetic activity for diﬀerent
modes and degrees of nesting. Since we are interested
in ﬁnding the upper limit of variability, we only per-
formed simulations for stars observed from their equa-
torial planes. Solar-like stars observed from out of this
plane will show smaller variabilities (N`emec et al. 2020).
We carried out 10 random realisations of AR emergences
for each combination of activity level and degree of nest-
ing, with the exception of 50 realisations for F100. Such
multiple runs were made to quantify the posterior width
owing to randomness in AR emergence.

Figure 4. Sample light curves for free-nesting (upper panels) and active-longitude (lower panels) modes. For each mode, two
activity levels (columns) are shown with three degrees of nesting each (rows). S (cid:39) 0.19 in the left panels and S (cid:39) 0.23 on the
right panels. The nesting mode and degree, and the 25-day variation amplitude, R90, are indicated above each panel. Note that
for S = 0.19 the slightly higher R90 of the case F90 compared to A90 is a mere coincidence and does not contradict the overall
trend of the AL mode yielding higher variability than free-nest mode (see Fig. 3).

Figure 3 shows R90 as a function of S for free-nesting
and active-longitude modes. Variability increases with
S in all cases, owing to an increasing occurrence of ARs
(which depends on the S, see Sect. 2). For F00 (i.e., for
random emergence locations), R90 scales roughly lin-
early with S. The dependences for higher degrees of
nesting gradually deviate from linearity with increasing
S. This is because the area coverage of spots is pro-
portional to S2 in the model, in accordance with solar
data. A random distribution of spots would thus imply
that the variability is proportional to the square-root of
spot coverage, i.e., to S. Stronger nesting steepens the
dependence and in the extreme case of 100% nesting the
variability is proportional to the coverage, i.e. to S2.

Comparison of the left and right panels of Fig. 3 shows
that the AL mode enhances variability even more than
free nesting. This is because the permanent active lon-
gitudes lead to a more coherent superposition of ARs

during each full rotation. Starting from A50, the depen-
dences are nearly quadratic, in parallel with the func-
tional relationship between the spot coverage and S.

In their sample of solar-like stars, R20 detected vari-
ability amplitudes of up to 0.7%. Taking R90 = 0.7% as
an upper limit, we can consider various possibilities for
how such a value can be reached, using Fig. 3. For the
solar level of nesting (F50) an activity level of S = 0.25
is needed. According to Eq. (1-2) from Shapiro et al.
(2014) employed in our model (see Sect. 2), such an S-
index corresponds to mean spot and facular coverages
of about 17 and 5 times larger than the correspond-
ing annually averaged solar values during the maximum
of Cycle 22. For F100 (a single nest throughout four
years), the variability R90 = 0.7% is reached already at
S (cid:39) 0.215 (spot and facular coverages are about 6 and 2
times higher than solar, respectively). For F90 the same

6

Is¸ık et al.

level is reached at S (cid:39) 0.23 (spot and facular coverages
10 and 3 times solar).

In the active-longitude mode, R90 = 0.7% is reached
for A50 at S (cid:39) 0.23, similar to F90. For A90, S (cid:39) 0.22
would be suﬃcient (spot and facular coverages 7 and
2.5 times solar, respectively). The signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the extreme cases F100 and A100 is because
in free nesting F100 forms a single nest, whereas A100
distributes the same number of emergences into two ALs
in opposition, resulting in weaker variability.

3.2. Active longitudes: more regular light curves

We now investigate the impact of nesting on the mor-
phology of light curves. Figure 4 shows sample light
curves, for S (cid:39) 0.19 (expected during a solar maximum)
and S (cid:39) 0.23. In the free-nest mode, the variability in-
creases with the nesting degree (in line with Fig. 3),
but the brightness variation is still far from being sinu-
soidal, even for F90.
In the active-longitude mode at
S = 0.23, the light curves not only reach the highest
observed variability levels, but also become much more
regular. They look very similar to the light curves shown
by many periodic stars, i.e. sine-like, exhibiting smooth
changes between consecutive dips. Additional simula-
tions involving a single AL with the same width resulted
in stronger but less sinusoidal rotational modulations.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Data collected by the Kepler space telescope indicate
that stars with near-solar rotation rates and fundamen-
tal parameters can have a broad range of photometric
variabilities. R20 have recently found that the periodic
subsample of such stars appear to be signiﬁcantly more
variable than the Sun.

We have shown here that the full range of observed
variabilities of such stars can be explained by preserving
solar properties of active regions but going well beyond
the degree of active-region nesting presently observed
on the Sun and somewhat beyond the solar magnetic
activity level. This is accomplished using a very sim-
ple model, in which the fundamental properties of solar
variability are reasonably well-represented, though for
other stars some of the assumptions involved may not
apply.

Our model allows connecting the diﬀerence between
the rotational variability of pseudosolar and solar-like
samples of R20 with the diﬀerences in the activity level.
We have shown here that the exact connection depends
on the degree of AR nesting. Our calculations indicate
that the mean and maximum variability amplitudes of
the solar-like sample analysed by R20 (R90 being 0.38%
and 0.70%, respectively) can be obtained by a simple

increase of activity from the solar value (i.e. without
increase of nesting). This, however, would require an
increase of the activity level up to S = 0.22 for the
mean and S = 0.25 for the maximum. With AR nesting,
say F90 case (compared to F50 for the Sun), we need
a much more moderate increase of activity, S (cid:39) 0.20
(mean) and S (cid:39) 0.23 (maximum)).

Both estimates appear to be consistent with the re-
cent results from Zhang et al. (2020, see their Fig. 1),
who utilised LAMOST spectra to measure S- indices
of stars from the R20 sample and showed that
the
periodic,
‘solar-like’ stars are moderately more active
than the Sun. Unfortunately, we cannot make a di-
rect comparison of the S-indices found by Zhang et al.
(2020) with our numerical experiments, because the
LAMOST S-index scale cannot be directly converted to
the Mount-Wilson (MW) S-index used in our study. At
the same time, Fig. 1 from Zhang et al. (2020) shows
that the mean S-index of the solar-like stars is lower
than that of stars with rotation periods between 10 and
20 days. These faster-rotating stars are expected to have
S-indices (in MW scale) between about 0.20-0.28 (see
Figs. 1-2 from Shapiro et al. 2020b).

Furthermore, we found that the nearly sinusoidal light
curves of strongly variable solar-like stars can be re-
produced by a highly non-axisymmetric pattern of AR
emergence, with an azimuthal wavenumber of two. Con-
sequently, such a pattern of AR emergence can simulta-
neously explain both the amplitude and morphology of
the observed light curves. We note that double active
longitudes have often been suggested to explain the light
curves of very active BY Dra-, RS CVn- and FK Com-
type cool stars (Berdyugina 2005). Most such stars are
components of close binaries.

We suggest three possible mechanisms for solar-like
stars to exhibit active longitudes: 1) they can be compo-
nents of non-eclipsing close binaries or they have warm
or hot gas-giant components (Shibata et al. 2013). In
the active components of such systems, tidal forces can
lead to preferred longitudinal zones for emerging ﬂux
tubes (see, e.g., Holzwarth & Sch¨ussler 2003, though
they found this tendency for Prot ∼ 2 d). In that case,
AL-type nesting can permanently lead to strong rota-
tional variability (see also Korhonen & Elstner 2005).
2) AL-type nesting can be a generic phenomenon, which
all solar-type stars can undergo from time to time, or
above some activity level. 3) Solar-like stars can have
time-varying degree of nesting, as well as temporarily
existing ALs, which can be responsible for those light
curves exhibiting transitions between very regular and
less regular variations. These possibilities should be ex-
plored more thoroughly in the future.

The model presented in this letter was kept very sim-
ple, to demonstrate the overall eﬀects of AR-nesting on
brightness variability in solar-like stars. Physically more
consistent models that simulate ﬂux emergence and sur-
face transport processes (following I¸sık et al. 2018) in-
cluding eﬀects of AR-nesting and the rotation rate are
planned for a subsequent study.

APPENDIX

A. FORWARD MODELLING OF LIGHT CURVES

The detailed procedure of light-curve synthesis has been described by Shapiro et al. (2020a). We brieﬂy explain in

the following the main concept of the model relevant to our purpose of simulating rotational variability.

In our model active regions (ARs) emerge instantaneously at random times within 1600 days. Consequently, the
emergence frequency of ARs is constant, i.e. we do not consider stellar activity cycles. The activity level of a simulated
star is then deﬁned by the total number of emergences. For each realisation of emergences we calculate not only the
time series of stellar brightness, but also the time series of disc area coverage by spots. Using the dependence between
the stellar disc coverage by spots and the S-index extrapolated by Shapiro et al. (2014) from the Sun to more active
stars, we obtain S corresponding to a given light curve.

The ARs in our model consist of spot umbrae, spot penumbrae, and faculae. The contrast of a particular magnetic
feature relative to the quiet regions (i.e.
regions on the stellar surface free from any apparent manifestation of
magnetic features) depends on the wavelength and the position of the magnetic feature on the stellar disc. We have
used wavelength-dependent contrasts calculated by Unruh et al. (1999) and convolved them with the Kepler spectral
passband (see N`emec et al. 2020, for a comprehensive study of the eﬀect of diﬀerent passbands on the measured
variability).

The areas of the spot parts of ARs are randomly drawn from a log-normal probability distribution, which considers
spot groups at their maximum-development phase, given by Baumann & Solanki (2005, Table 1). We choose areas to
fall between 60 and 3000 µSH (millionths of a solar hemisphere), to cover the entire range of sunspot group areas in the
part of the RGO record for which the distribution can be ﬁt by a log-normal function. Following Wenzler et al. (2006)
we attribute 80% of spot area to penumbra and the remaining 20% to umbra. The ratio between facular and spot areas
of ARs at the moment of emergence, Af /As, is assumed to be the same for all ARs for a given stellar activity level
(see Fig. 10 from Shapiro et al. 2020a). It is calculated to fulﬁl the relationship between the instantaneous facular and
spot disc-area coverages observed for the Sun and extrapolated to more active stars (namely, Eqs. 1–2 from Shapiro
et al. 2014).

We do not consider a speciﬁc geometrical shape for an AR, prescribing the same value of the foreshortening to
the entire region. This approximation is justiﬁed by the fact that the detailed morphology of ARs (i.e. spot group
surrounded by facular regions) has a small eﬀect on rotational variability, as long as the ARs are in the same size
range with solar ARs, which we assume here for other solar-like stars.

Following the emergence, we model the decay of spots and faculae as a continuous reduction of their areas. We
consider a linear decay law following an instantaneous emergence, with a spot decay rate of 25 µSH d−1, given that
quadratic and linear decay laws are not distinguishable in the RGO dataset (Baumann & Solanki 2005). For a given
active region a decay time of its facular part was set to be three times longer than those of its spot part (see Shapiro
et al. 2020a, for a detailed discussion and case study).

The input physical parameters determining the ﬁnal light curve are listed in Table 1.
Two example light curves are shown in Fig. 5 (taken from Fig. 4), in which the spot and facular components are
shown separately. The facular-to-spot area ratio during the emergence of any spot is determined by the S-index, such
that the ratio decreases with S (see above). As a result, the relative contribution of the spot component in the total
variability increases with the activity level.
