Abstract 

Sarin is a very lethal synthetic organophosphorated compound that inhibits the nervous system muscle control. 

Although  not  used  as  a chemical  weapon  anymore,  it  still  worries the authorities  regarding  possible  use  by 

terrorists.  Most  of  the  studies  about  sarin  are  theoretical/computational  due  to  its  high  lethality  and  are 

concentrated  in  its  detection  and  degradation.  Few  studies  are  about  air  filtration  from  sarin  gas.  Here,  the 

potential of graphene oxide-based membranes to filter air from sarin/air mixtures is investigated by classical 

molecular dynamics simulations. Membranes formed by one and two nanosheets of porous reduced graphene 

oxide (rGO) were considered. The passage of sarin and air molecules through these membranes from a highly 

concentrated  region  to  an  empty  one,  is  evaluated  as  a  function  of  temperature  and  sarin/air  relative 

concentration.  Sarin  molecules  are  shown  to  be  trapped  by  hydroxyl  and  carboxyl  chemical  groups  in  the 

nanosheet, while a considerable passage of air molecules (N2, O2 and Ar) through the membranes was verified. 

The  results  show  the  capacity  of  the  rGO  membranes  to  retain  sarin  from  passing  through,  even  at  high 

temperatures, thus indicating their potential to be used as a filter for sarin gas. 

1. Introduction  

O-isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate, better known as  sarin (C4H10FO2P), is one of most 

powerful nerve agents that worries the authorities around the World regarding its use as a chemical 

weapon, despite its production and stockpiling prohibition since 1997 [1–3]. The effects of sarin in 

human body depends on dose and time exposition, varying from vision alterations and headaches to 

 
 
death, basically due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, which is  a very important enzyme for 

muscles and nerves controlling, causing respiratory arrest [4,5]. 

Literature shows many  computational works  about  sarin molecule, mostly  based  on density 

functional theory (DFT), and focusing on sarin adsorption on different kinds of surfaces. Dos Santos 

et al. [6], for example, reported the sarin adsorption on doped boron nitride nanotubes. Tsyshevsky et 

al. [7] and Lee et al. [8] studied the adsorption of sarin molecules on molybdenum dioxide and anatase 

titanium dioxide surfaces, respectively. Other works have been focused on the degradation of sarin 

molecules [9], that is predicted to start from 350 °C [9], and depends on the surface where they are 

adsorbed,  if  TiO2  [10]  or  pristine  and  hydroxylated  ZnO  surfaces  [11].  Molecular  dynamics  (MD) 

simulations and other computational techniques have been also employed in studies of sarin. Almeida 

et al. [12] and Ekström et al. [13] used MD simulations to study the effects of sarin on the activation 

of  the  enzyme  acetylcholinesterase  responsible  to  catalyze  some  neurotransmitters  in  the  body. 

Mahmoudi et al. [14] and Lee et al. [15] used MD simulations to determine the diffusion coefficients 

of sarin encapsulated by β-cyclodextrins cavities and in polyelectrolyte membranes, respectively.  

In contrast to the variety of computational works on sarin, experiments are not often found in 

the  literature,  since  the  manipulation  of  sarin  gas  is  very  dangerous  and  requires  very  controlled 

environments. However, few works [9,16,17] reported some experimental analyses on sarin adsorption 

and decomposition. 

Although the relevance of the subject, there are only few studies on filtration of sarin gas [18–

21], in contrast to several works on detection and degradation of this and other nerve agent gases [6-

11,22–31]. On the other hand, there are many studies about the role on gas separation and detection 

using  graphene  oxide  (GO)  or  reduced  graphene  oxide  (rGO)  [32–39].  In  order  to  give  some 

contribution to this topic, in this work we present a molecular dynamics based computational study 

about the passage of sarin/air mixture through two types of rGO membranes: (1) one formed by one 

porous rGO nanosheet and (2) the other formed by two parallel, non-aligned, porous rGO nanosheets. 

Our  analyses  focus  on  the  influence  of  initial  concentration  of  sarin  gas,  temperature,  and  the 

interaction between the gas and the membrane, on the filtration mechanisms of air from sarin gas by 

rGOs. 

Next  section  presents  the  structural  models  and  simulations  methods.  Then,  the  results  are 

presented and discussed. At the end of the manuscript, the conclusion section summarizes the main 

results of this work.  

2. Modeling and simulation methods 

2.1 Modeling of the rGO nanosheet, sarin and air  

The filtration system is defined by a simulation box of 34.0 Å × 32.3 Å × 200 Å of size along 

x, y and z directions, respectively, in the middle of which a membrane consisting of one or two rGO 

nanosheets of 32.6 Å x 30.7 Å of size, is placed orthogonally to the z direction of the box (see Figures 

1 and 2).  For the membrane with one rGO nanosheet, the simulation box is divided into two regions 

(I and II on each side of the membrane), with one initially containing the sarin-air mixture, and the 

other initially empty. For the membrane with two rGO nanosheets, the box is divided into three regions 

(I, II and III), where the regions I and III, on both sides of the membrane are similar to that of the 

previous case, and the region II is that between the two rGO nanosheets (Figure 2).

molecules drawn in the figure are not the exact ones simulated in this work and are shown here just for illustration and 

distinction  between  the  two  regions.  Blue,  red,  white,  orange,  gray  and  cyan  represent  nitrogen,  oxygen,  hydrogen, 

phosphorous, carbon in sarin and carbon in rGO atoms, respectively.

between nanosheets is represented by  𝑑. The number of molecules drawn in the figure are not the exact 

ones simulated in this work and are shown here just for illustration and distinction between regions. Blue, 

red, white, orange, gray and cyan represent nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, phosphorous, carbon in sarin and 

carbon in rGO atoms, respectively.  

Figure 3 (a) shows the rGO nanosheet structure containing 9.8% of oxygenated groups: OH 

(hydroxyl), OCO (epoxy) and COOH (carboxyl). On the rGO plane, hydroxyl and epoxy groups are 

randomly distributed while carboxyl groups are placed at the edges of a pore of about 193.4 Å² of area. 

The  concentrations  of  hydroxyl,  epoxy  and  carboxyl  groups  with  respect  to  carbon  atoms  of  the 

 
  
 
 
nanosheets are 3.7%, 4.0% and 1.5% as considered in previous studies [40–42]. The sarin molecule 

model considered here is based on references [43,44], that used the united-atom approach for the CH3 

groups, while all atoms were explicitly considered for the rGO structure models. Figure 3 (b) shows 

the sarin molecule with atomic partial charges. The pore size, presented in Figure 3 (a), was chosen to 

allow the passage of a sarin molecule as a whole. 

Figure 3. Porous rGO nanosheet (a) and sarin molecule (b) models used in this work.  In (b), the values of the electrical 

charge of each atom is shown, in units of 𝑒. Blue, red, white, orange, gray and cyan represent nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, 

phosphorous, carbon in sarin and carbon in rGO  atoms, respectively. CH3 groups are circulated in red and their names 

“C3s” and “CH3s” distinguish their relative position on the sarin molecule.  

For air modeling, it is adopted the composition of 78% of nitrogen molecules (N2), 21% of 

oxygen molecules (O2) and 1% of argon atoms (Ar) [45]. 

To describe the intramolecular interactions, the following potential energy function is used: 

  
 
 
 
𝑈𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎 = 𝑘𝐵(𝑟 − 𝑟0)2 + 𝑘𝜃(𝜃 − 𝜃0)2 + 𝑈𝑑𝑖ℎ𝑒𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑙 .                         (1) 

The first two terms in this equation refer to bond distance and bond angle energies, respectively, and 

the  last  term  describes  the  torsions.  𝑘𝐵  and  𝑘𝜃  are  constants  related  to  the  magnitude  of  the 

corresponding  interactions;  𝑟  and  𝜃  represent,  respectively,  instantaneous  bond  distance  and  bond 

angle while the index “0” indicates the equilibrium distance (𝑟0) and angle (𝜃0). 

The potential associated to dihedral torsions of the structure is system dependent and is given 

by:  

𝑘𝑑[1 + cos(𝑛𝜙 − 𝑑)], for the rGO; 

𝑈𝑑𝑖ℎ𝑒𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑙 = {

∑ 𝑘𝑖[1 + cos(𝑛𝑖𝜙 − 𝑑𝑖)] , for dihedrals A, B and C in sarin;  
∑𝐴𝑚 cos𝑚−1(𝜙) , for dihedral D in sarin,

 (2) 

where A, B, C and D represent the dihedral torsional angles associated to the following sequences of 

atoms in sarin: C1s − O1s − Ps − O2𝑠, C3s − C1s − O1s – Ps, C1s − O1s − Ps − CH3s and C1s − O1s 

− Ps  – Fs,  respectively.    In the above equation,  𝜙  is  the torsional angle,  while  𝑑 and  𝑑𝑖  are phase 

factors;  𝑘𝑑,  𝑘𝑖  and  𝐴𝑛  are  related  to  the  magnitude  of  the  torsion  barrier  energy;  𝑛  and  𝑛𝑖  are  the 

multiplicity (number of potential minima generated in a 360° rotation).  

Completing the description of the potential energy of the whole structure, the intermolecular 

interactions are here represented by the following van der Waals and Coulombic general terms:

The  parameters  for  rGO,  air  and  sarin  models  were  obtained  from  references  [42,46],  [42,47]  and 

[18,43,44], respectively. 

2.2 Simulation details of the membrane system with one rGO nanosheet 

The rGO nanosheet in the one membrane system is fixed at the middle of the simulation box 

corresponding to the position 𝑧 = 103 Å. As previously mentioned, it divides the simulation box in two 

regions, here named I and II as shown in Figure 1. The sarin/air mixture is initially placed on region I, 

while region II is empty. MD simulations of sarin/air mixtures were carried out for 300 K, 500 K, 700 

K  and  900  K,  during  10  ns,  using  a  timestep  of  1.0  fs.  For  each  temperature,  different  sarin 

concentrations  were  considered  as  follows:  the  number  of  sarin  atoms  is  always  kept  constant  and 

equal to 20 molecules, but the number of air constituent molecules, N2, O2 and Ar, varied so as to 

obtain the sarin concentrations of 9%, 17% and 28%. The number of sarin and air molecules were 

defined to be significant to counting molecules that pass through the membranes. At the same time, 

the number of gas molecules together with the choice of the box size, imply a situation in which the 

pressure difference between the regions on both sides of the membranes is very high, as compared to 

the atmospheric pressure (about 25 atms for 28% of concentration of sarin), in order to verify the rGO 

membrane potential for air filtration from sarin/air mixture in a situation of high pressure gradient. All 

the  simulations  were  carried  out  using  classical  molecular  dynamics  implemented  through  the 

LAMMPS  package  [48],  on  a  constant  number  of  molecules,  volume  and  temperature  (NVT) 

ensemble,  with  Nosé-Hoover  algorithm  for  temperature  control  and  periodic  boundary  conditions 

along 𝑥 and 𝑦 directions. Along the 𝑧 direction, at the edges of the simulation box, a repulsive potential 

is applied to the system to ensure that the only way a molecule or atom goes from region I to II or back 

is through the pore in the nanosheet. 

 
 
2.3 Simulation details of the membrane system with two rGO nanosheets 

Two configurations of the membrane formed by two rGO nanosheets are considered in this part 

of the study: i) one with aligned pores; and ii) the other with non-aligned pores. Figures 2 (a) and (b) 

show  these  configurations,  respectively.  For  each  configuration,  three  values  of  the  distance,  d, 

between the nanosheets were considered, (d = 7 Å, 10 Å and 13 Å), thus creating three regions, as 

already mentioned before (in subsection 2.1) and shown in Figure 2 (c): Region  I - where sarin/air 

mixture is initially placed; Region II - an intermediate region between the two nanosheets; and Region 

III - an initially empty region. For this system, we performed simulations at 300 K, 600 K and 900 K, 

also using timestep of 1.0 fs, and for a total amount of simulation time of 15 ns. In all these simulations, 

the  sarin  concentration  was  constant  and  equal  to  17%  (considering  20  sarin  molecules).  For  the 

simulations with one and two nanosheets, the properties were evaluated using the data from the last 

1.0 ns.  

3. Results and discussion 

3.1 Analysis for one nanosheet membrane 

Table 1 shows the number of sarin molecules, N, that passed through the pore of the system 

with  just  one  rGO  nanosheet  for  different  temperatures  and  sarin  concentrations,  after  10  ns  of 

simulation. It is possible to see in this table that both sarin concentration and temperature influences 

the values of N. For low temperature, however, it is remarkable to see that after 10 ns, not a single 

sarin  molecule  has  reached  the  region  II,  despite  the  high  pressure  difference.  It  is  important  to 

highlight that the pressure at the initial sarin/air mixture region I varied from 79 to 25 atms, respectively 

to the sarin concentration variation from 9% to 28%. As the temperature increases, the passage of sarin 

molecules increases as well, where it is also possible to see the dependence of N with the initial sarin 

concentration.  The dependence of  N on temperature  is  coherent  with  the fact  that higher values  of 

 
kinetic energy (directly affected by temperature), increases the chances of a sarin molecule to cross 

from region I to region II. As we have fixed the number of sarin molecules in all simulations, and sarin 

concentration is changed by changing the number of air molecules, small sarin concentration means 

the presence of more air molecules within the system and, therefore, more chances of air molecules to 

occupy the space close to the rGO pore and, consequently, more chances of sarin molecules to collide 

with them, thus helping to avoid their passage through the pore.  

 Table 1. Number of sarin molecules, 𝑁, that move from region I to region II through the pore after 10 ns of MD simulation 

at four temperatures (300 K, 500 K, 700 K and 900 K). The number of sarin molecules initially confined in region I was 

constant and equal to 20.

Another point that was observed from the simulations is that for all conditions, even for high 

temperature simulations, sarin molecules always end up surrounding the rGO nanosheet. This can be 

observed in Figure 4, which presents the radial distribution function, g(r), between the carbon atom 

(C)  from  rGO  nanosheet  and  central  oxygen  atom  (O1s)  from  sarin,  for  each  value  of  sarin 

concentration studied here (Figure 4 (a)) and each value of the simulated temperature (Figure 4 (b) for 

17%  of  sarin  concentration).  In  both  graphics,  the  presence  of  a  peak  at  about  7  Å  reveals  a 

considerable attraction between sarin and the nanosheet, that remains the same despite the different 

simulated temperature or sarin concentration in the system.  

 
 
 
We  analyzed  in  more  detail  the  origin  of  this  attraction  and  we  have  found,  based  on  the 

presence  of  the  peaks  in  radial  distribution  function  curves  (whose  additional  graphs  are  shown  in 

sections A, B and C of the Supplementary Materials), that it comes mainly from three interactions: one 

between the hydrogen atom of carboxyl group (Hcarb) and the O2s oxygen from sarin (see Figure 2(b)); 

the other between hydrogen from hydroxyl (Hhyd) and the same O2s oxygen atom; and the interaction 

between  the  hydrogen  atom  from  carboxyl  and  fluorine  atom  from  sarin  (Fs).  These  latter  two 

interactions  can  explain  why,  in  Figure  4  (b),  an  increasing  temperature  up  to  700  K  causes  an 

increasing in g(r) values around the peak, and for 900 K, the value decreases to below that of 300 K. 

Since O2s and Fs atoms are oppositely separate by the phosphorous (Ps), as the temperature increases, 

the displacement of sarin molecule, caused by thermal agitation, can favor the approximation between 

Fs and hydroxyl group. At 900 K, the thermal agitation is high enough to give energy to some sarin 

molecules to move away from the nanosheet, thus decreasing the peak value of g(r). Figures 4 (c) and 

(d) show g(r) for Hhyd – O2s and Hcarb – O2s at 300 K and 900 K, all for sarin concentration equal to 

17%. Inset in Figure 4 (d) highlights the peaks about 2.0 Å of the g(r) function corresponding to the 

Hcarb – Fs pair of atoms, also at 300 K and 900 K. Again, these results evidence that the attraction 

between rGO and sarin keeps strong even at high temperatures (g(r) curves for 500 K and 700 K were 

not shown in Figures 4 (c) and (d) for the sake of clarity, but they are shown in Supplementary Material, 

in section D).

function of concentration (a) and temperature (b), and between hydrogens, from hydroxyl (c) and carboxyl (d) groups, and 

the oxygen (O2s) of sarin. The inset depicts the g(r) resulting from the interaction of hydrogen from carboxyl and sarin 

fluorine atom. All curves shown in graphs in (b), (c) and (d) corresponds to 17% of sarin concentration. 

In  order  to  further  understand  the  attraction  between  sarin  and  rGO  nanosheet,  we  have 

evaluated the potential energy of one sarin molecule as a function of the distance to the nanosheet, 

considering three possible molecule orientations relative to the plane of the nanosheet: perpendicular, 

45°  tilted,  and  parallel  to  the  nanosheet  plane.  The  molecule  is  quasi-statically  moved  by  small 

increments of 0.05 Å from –10 to 10 Å keeping the atoms of the rGO fixed. The energy curves for the 

three orientations are presented in Figure 5 (which also shows the sarin orientations in relation to rGO 

as well), where the z coordinate of the nanosheet was set to 𝑧 = 0 Å. For all sarin orientations, one can 

notice the presence of at least one potential well with minimum value around the distance of 2 Å from 

the  nanosheet  carbon  plane.  For  the  perpendicular  orientation  of  sarin,  the  potential  presents  an 

 
 
additional minimum around 3.7 Å. The asymmetry along z in the format of the potential curves come 

from the fact that functional groups in rGO are not symmetrically distributed over both of its sides, 

causing  a  natural  asymmetry  in  the  distances  between  each  atom  of  the  sarin  molecule  and  the 

functional groups in the nanosheet. We compare the values of the potential energy associated to each 

depth of these potential energy minima to thermal energy 𝑘𝐵𝑇 (𝑘𝐵 is the Boltzmann constant) at room 

temperature (𝑘𝐵𝑇 ~ 0.59 kcal/mol), and both values for each minimum in the three graphics. These 

results show that sarin molecules need high kinetic energy to  escape the rGO attraction. They  also 

explain the absence of dependence of the peak position of the radial distribution functions, g(r), on 

sarin concentration or temperature (up to 900 K) shown in Figure 4.  

Figure 5. Potential energy curves for three different orientations (shown aside) of sarin relatively to carbon 

plane of the nanosheet. In details are shown the estimated values of each potential well in kcal/mol (in red) 

and in terms of the thermal energy, 𝑘𝐵𝑇, at room temperature (in blue). 

Following these observations, it is also important to compare the distribution of sarin and air 

molecules around the rGO nanosheets, i.e, along the z coordinate of the simulation box. In order to do 

so, the number of sarin and air molecules per volume, N/V, along the 𝑧 direction, in the equilibrium, 

 
was calculated as follows. The simulation box was divided into slabs and the number of each type of 

molecules lying in each slab was counted and averaged along the last 1 ns of simulation. Figures 6 (a) 

and (b), then, show the concentration of sarin and air molecules along the z coordinate, respectively. 

Figure 6 (a) shows that closer to the nanosheet,  larger the number  of sarin molecules, for different 

temperatures and 17% of sarin concentration. Figures 6 (a) and 6 (b) show that the largest values of 

N/V of both air and sarin molecules around the membrane (around z ~ 0 Å) happen for 𝑇 = 300 𝐾. 

This is justified by the fact that at this temperature, the kinetic energy of sarin and air molecules is not 

enough to push them away from the nanosheet. But at different temperatures, the concentration of sarin 

molecules around the membrane monotonically decreases with temperature while the air concentration 

does not. Although most of the air molecules also surround the nanosheet, it is clear that sarin gets 

much more concentrated around the rGO than air molecules, which get spread out amongst the two 

regions I and II.  This confirms the potential energy analysis between sarin and rGO shown in Figure 

5 and reveals that the air-rGO attraction is less effective than that between rGO and sarin, even for 

high temperatures. Similar results were reported for the system containing a mixture of sarin and air 

crossing a pore on a graphene nanosheet [18].

3.2 Analysis for two nanosheets membranes  

The analyses performed for the systems with two rGO membranes are similar to that performed 

for the system with just one nanosheet. The number of sarin and air molecules that moved from the 

region I to regions II and III, for different rGO distances (𝑑 = 7, 10 and 13 Å), for different temperatures 

(𝑇 = 300, 600 and 900 K) and for aligned and non-aligned orientations of pores were investigated for 

the particular case of 17% of sarin concentration. The results are summarized in Figure 7, which shows 

the number of sarin molecules present on regions II (Figure 7 (a)) and III (Figure 7 (b)) at the end of 

15 ns MD simulations for each combination of d and T values, and one particular result for a test of a 

long 60 ns MD simulation at d = 13 Å and T = 600 K. Figure 7 (a) shows that the number of molecules 

in region II (between the nanosheets) is, in general, higher for the configuration of aligned pores than 

for non-aligned ones. It is also observed that the number of sarin molecules in each region is affected 

 
 
 
by both the distance between nanosheets and the temperature of the system. The effect of temperature 

is obvious, since larger the average kinetic energy of sarin molecules, higher the chance to escape from 

the  potential  energy  attraction  of  rGOs.  Increasing  𝑑  increases  the  volume  of  the  region  II,  which 

provides more room to accommodate more sarin molecules. Therefore, larger the distance, d, larger 

the number of sarin molecules in region II and, then, higher the chance for a sarin molecule to reach 

the region III. According to Figure 7 (a), there is no much difference in the number of sarin molecules 

in region II between systems with membranes formed by aligned and non-aligned rGO pores, if the 

temperature is smaller than 900 K. Except for the membrane configuration of aligned rGOs at d = 7 

Å, for which a single sarin molecule reached the region III after 15 ns of simulation, Figure 7 (b) shows 

that none sarin molecule reached region III for both membrane configurations at temperature values 

up to 600 K after 15 ns of MD simulations. At 900 K, however, Figure 7 (b) shows that the non-aligned 

pores membrane configuration was able to completely block the passage of sarin for all conditions of 

temperature and rGOs distance, except for 𝑑 = 13 Å. At this last value of rGOs distance, some sarin 

molecules had got enough energy to escape the membrane attraction and reach region III.  

In order to verify if the filtration of air from sarin molecules by the two rGOs membranes is 

not a time-dependent result, we performed MD simulations for up to 60 ns (four times longer than 

previous ones) for both aligned and non-aligned membrane configurations for the particular case of d 

= 13 Å and T = 600 K. Figures 7 (a) and (b) show the results for the number of sarin molecules in 

regions II and III, respectively, after 60 ns of MD simulations for 𝑑 = 13 Å and 𝑇 = 600 K, for both 

aligned and non-aligned pores configurations. It is observed that six sarin molecules moved to region 

II for the aligned configuration (Figure 7(a)) and none to region III (Figure 7 (b)). This suggests that 

the concentration of sarin molecules around and between the two rGO nanosheets is a steady state for 

temperatures up to 600 K.  

 
 
Figure  7.  Number  of  sarin  molecules  in  region  II  (a)  and  region  III  (b)  for  aligned  and  non-aligned  pores  membrane 

configurations after 15 ns of MD simulations. For the particular case corresponding to d = 13 Å and T = 600 K, for which 

no sarin molecules were found in region III after 15 ns, additional 45 ns of MD simulations were performed for both aligned 

and non-aligned configurations. The number of sarin molecules after 60 ns are shown in panels (a) and (b).  

Figure 8 shows the distribution of air molecules along the 𝑧 direction for membranes of aligned 

and non-aligned rGO pores after 15 ns of MD simulations. The position of the first nanosheet in all 

graphics is set to 𝑧 = 0 Å. Regardless of the pore alignment, Figures 8 (a) and (c) show, for fixed 𝑑 = 

7 Å (region II extends, in these two graphics, from 𝑧 = 0 Å to 𝑧 = 7 Å) and temperatures greater than 

300 K, a shift of the distribution curves to the left, i.e., towards the 𝑧 < 0 region (region I) and, for the 

aligned case, a small increasing of absolute values of the number of air molecules for 𝑧  > 30 Å (region 

 
  
III). These results show that some air constituent molecules that cross the two rGO nanosheets have 

enough energy to reach region III, despite most of the air molecules tend to wander near to nanosheet. 

The shift to the left of the peaks of the air distribution curves for temperatures of 600 K and 900 K in 

comparison to that of 300 K, can be explained by the following: the air molecules have their kinetic 

energy increased  with  increasing temperature.  It  gives more mobility to  the air molecules to  move 

around and along the simulation box. As the membrane imposes a barrier against crossing to region 

III, the movement within region I at distances far from the first rGO also increases, thus causing the 

decrease of the number of molecules that surround the nanosheet (decrease of the magnitude of the 

peaks for T > 300 K). At the same time, for the small number of air molecules that reach the region II, 

increasing the temperature causes the increase of the chance of these molecules to pass through the 

second rGO nanosheet thus reaching the region III. That is why the number of air molecules for T > 

300 K that are seen in region III, at z > 30 Å, approximately doubles when compared to that of T = 300 

K, at least for the aligned configuration. For the non-aligned configuration, the increase of temperature 

is not enough to increase the passage of air molecules to region III, so there are more air molecules 

spread out region I for the non-aligned configuration than for the aligned one. The distance between 

the nanosheets does not influence much the number of molecules around the first nanosheet for both 

pore orientations, as can be seen by the similarity of the position of all peaks in Figures 8 (b) and (d), 

for 𝑇 = 300 K and different values of 𝑑 (7 Å, 10 Å and 13 Å). However, there is a small decrease in 

the magnitude of this peak for d = 13 Å for both aligned and non-aligned configurations. For d = 13 Å 

in the aligned configuration, the decrease of the value of the peak is compensated by a slight increase 

of the number of the air molecules that passed to the region III (red curve in Figure 8(b)). For d = 13 

Å in the non-aligned configuration, there is an increase in the number of air molecules in region I (red 

curve in Figure 8(d)). Although non-aligned configurations block much more air molecules than the 

aligned  configurations,  the  first  did  not  prevent  them  to  reach  the  region  III.  The  remained  air 

molecules in region III for the non-aligned configurations are such that the pressure in region III is 

about 16,5 atms. That is an important result when the number of sarin molecules are analyzed in the 

same way.  

Figure  9  shows  the  distribution  of  sarin  molecules  along  the  z  direction  after  15  ns  of 

simulations. Small shifts to the left and to the right of the peak of this distribution can be seen  for 

different values of d and T. Although the similarity between sarin and air regarding the accumulation 

of molecules around the membranes, there is an important difference that makes the rGO membranes 

potentially appropriated to filter air from sarin gas. For all studied values of d and T, the number of 

sarin molecules in region III far from the membranes are null. The small shifts to the right of the peaks 

of the curves in Figure 9 for aligned configurations when compared to that of non-aligned ones, show 

that although the difference is relatively small, non-aligned configurations block more sarin molecules 

than aligned ones. Differences in the shape and size of the distributions shown in Figures 8 and 9 might 

come from the fact that sarin size and attraction to rGOs decrease its mobility as compared to that of 

the air.

4. Conclusions 

In this work, classical molecular dynamics simulations were performed to evaluate the ability 

of some models of graphene oxide-based membranes to filter air from a sarin/air mixture. Membranes 

with one or two porous rGO nanosheets were considered and the results are summarized as follows. 

Membranes with one porous rGO nanosheet were shown to be able to prevent sarin gas to pass through 

at room temperature. However, as shown in Table 1, the number of sarin molecules that passed through 

the membrane was observed to increase with the temperature. The existence of an attractive resultant 

potential energy between a sarin molecule and a single porous rGO nanosheet was, then, shown and 

its energy well, although greater than 𝑘𝐵𝑇 at room temperature, was shown not to be greater than the 

 
 
 
same parameter at temperatures about 900 K. In view of this result, the passage of sarin through two 

configurations  of  membranes  formed  by  two  adjacent  porous  rGO  nanosheets,  as  a  function  of 

temperature and distance between the nanosheets, was investigated. One configuration consists of a 

membrane with two rGOs with aligned pores, and the other with non-aligned pores. For these double 

rGO nanosheet membranes, it was shown that the air filtration from sarin is much more efficient than 

that of one nanosheet, even at high temperatures, and at different distances between the nanosheets. 

The  membranes  also  attracted  the  air  molecules,  but  our  results  showed  that  the  rGO  membranes 

completely block only sarin ones, thus allowing the passage of air at all temperature values studied 

here. The possibility to build different membranes from different nanostructures is as wide as the range 

of  conditions  to  test  the  filtration  of  sarin  gas.  We  hope,  then,  this  study  might  stimulate  further 

research on the filtration of sarin and other chemical warfare gases.
