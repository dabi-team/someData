Abstract. We use the spectral representation of the stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama ap-
proach to compute correlation functions in de Sitter space for a scalar ﬁeld with a symmetric
or asymmetric double-well potential. The terms in the spectral expansion are determined by
the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the time-independent Fokker-Planck diﬀerential oper-
ator, and we solve them numerically. The long-distance asymptotic behaviour is given by
the lowest state in the spectrum, but we demonstrate that the magnitude of the coeﬃents of
diﬀerent terms can be very diﬀerent, and the correlator can be dominated by diﬀerent terms
at diﬀerent distances. This can give rise to potentially observable cosmological signatures.
In many cases the dominant states in the expansion do not correspond to small ﬂuctuations
around a minimum of the potential and are therefore not visible in perturbation theory. We
discuss the physical interpretation these states, which can be present even when the potential
has only one minimum.

The study of a quantized scalar ﬁeld in de Sitter space is a mature endeavour [1–4] possessing
well-known diﬃculties when the ﬁeld is light [5–8]. Light spectator scalars in de Sitter space
are not just of formal interest, but rather they can have a variety of cosmological implications
such as generation of dark matter [9–11] or triggering electroweak vacuum decay [12–14].
The stochastic approach presented in Refs. [15, 16] is a powerful way of addressing this
problem; it is analytically tractable yet it provides accurate results that are often superior to
more traditional resummation methods. The approach is based on the realization that the
ultraviolet part of the ﬁeld may to a good approximation be treated as white noise allowing
one to express all results via classical stochastics. For other techniques, see Refs. [17–29]

The stochastic approach has become increasingly popular in recent years, likely due to
its great eﬃcacy, and in this vein we note the recent works [30–46]. Often the focus is on
the local probability distribution of the ﬁeld or on local expectation values, even though the
correlation of ﬂuctutations over space is arguably the more relevant object physically. The
spatial correlators have been addressed for example in Refs. [9, 11, 35, 47–59]. Speciﬁcally, in
Ref. [59] it was shown how correlators at noncoincident points can be eﬀectively calculated
with numerical techniques in conjunction with the spectral expansion based on eigenfunctions
and -values already discussed in Ref. [15].

The focus of Ref. [59] was on a single spectator scalar φ with quadratic and quartic
terms in its potential while limiting the parameters to only include positive mass terms i.e.

potentials possessing a single minimum at the origin. In this work we extend this analysis to
include potentials with two possibly non-degenerate minima. Namely, we focus on a potential

This potential has two minima if ¯α > 3(β/2)2/3.
In typical perturbative treatments, the
ﬁeld is assumed to ﬂuctuate near the minimum of the potential, but the stochastic spectral
expansion does not require that assumption. As we will show, in many cases the dominant
contributions to the correlators come from large-amplitude ﬂuctuations that are not visible
in perturbation theory.

This paper is organised as follows: In Section 2 we summarise the stochastic spectral
expansion and the numerical technique we used to ﬁnd the terms in the expansion. In Sec-
tions 3 and 4, we apply these techniques to calculate the spectral expansion in the symmetric
and asymmetric cases, respectively. In Section 5 we discuss the physical interpretation and
implications of our results, and in Section 6 we summarise our conclusions.

2 The stochastic spectral expansion

2.1 The eigenvalue equation

In the stochastic formalism one may express any correlator involving noncoincident spacetime
points as a spectral expansion [16, 59], by solving the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, Λn and
ψn, from the eigenvalue equation

v(φ) =

3H 4 V (φ) ; W (φ) = v(cid:48)(φ)2

−

v(cid:48)(cid:48)(φ) .

(2.2)

Since the input in the eigenvalue equation (2.1) is W (φ) (and not V (φ)) it is the W (φ) that
will turn out to be the fundamental quantity providing a qualitative understanding of the
behaviour of the eigenfunctions and -values. The behavior of v(φ) and W (φ) for the potential
(1.1) is illustrated in Fig. 1. In most cases solving equation (2.1) needs numerical methods.

2.2 Correlators and the power spectrum

If Gf (t2, t1; x2, x1) is the general correlator for some function of the ﬁeld f (φ), the autocor-
relation function

Gf (t; 0) =

f (φ(0))f (φ(t))
(cid:105)

(cid:104)

,

(2.3)

can via the stochastic formalism be expressed as a spectral expansion [16, 59] making use of
the eigenfunctions and -values from Eq. (2.1). Speciﬁcally, in terms of eigenvalues Λn and
spectral coeﬃcients fn one may write

Gf (t; 0) =

2.3 A numerical approach

Following Ref. [59], we solve the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of Eq. (2.1) numerically with
the ’overshoot/undershoot’ or otherwise known as ’wag the dog’ method. For a potential with
Z2 symmetry this problem reduces to a systematic iteration of just one unknown variable,
the eigenvalue Λn. This is due to the general feature that for a symmetric potential the
wave functions are either even or odd, which ﬁxes one of the two initial conditions required
for a second order diﬀerential equation and the remaining one is irrelevant as the functions
must be normalized. The essentials of the method are well-known and can be found for

well potential, which is addressed in Sec. 3. A major shortcoming is that modiﬁcations are
required when two eigenvalues are (almost) degenerate, which is encountered at the limit of a
large barrier, or equivalently, deep wells. However as we will show, this is precisely the limit
for which one may easily derive accurate analytic approximations and with a combination of
analytics an numerics the entire eigenvalue spectrum may be covered.
When there is no Z2 symmetry, for example as in Eq. (1.1) with β

= 0 that is discussed
in Sec. 4, the ’overshoot/undershoot’ needs to be performed with respect to two unknowns:
in addition to the eigenvalue one must iterate over the value or derivative of the function at
a point giving rise to a two dimensional iteration problem. This however amounts to only a
small increase in complexity of the algorithm or the expensiveness of the computation.

To facilitate a numerical analysis of the eigenfunctions and -values very similarly to
Ref. [59] for the potential (1.1) it is convenient to introduce the following dimensionless
quantities

There are two reasons why the redeﬁnitions we introduced are very useful for numerical
work. First, as one can see from Eq. (2.9), unlike the potential that is a function of µ, m
and λ there are only two unknown parameters, ¯α and β. Second, there are no terms in the
equation that would grow without bound at any of the limiting cases ¯α

, so broadly speaking all numerical factors are of the same order throughout the
and β
parameter space of interest.

3 The symmetric double-well potential

3.1 The ﬁrst ﬁve eigenfunctions/-values

Before addressing the general situation, let us ﬁrst focus on the important special case of a
symmetric double-well potential with two degenerate minima i.e. with β = 0. The ﬁrst four
non-trivial eigenvalues are plotted in Fig. 2. For ¯α (cid:38) 2.5 the eigenvalues Λ3 and Λ4 become
degenerate, complicating the numerical analysis, but by this point analytic approximations
derived in Section 3.2 (depicted with red dotted lines) are already very accurate.

The eigenfunctions ˜ψn for n

4 are shown in Fig. 3. For ¯α (cid:38) 1 the system separates
into linear combinations of solutions centered at the three minima of W (φ), which can be
seen in Fig. 1. Importantly, there are solutions that do not vanish close to the origin, even
when ¯α
1 which corresponds to a double-well potential with a very large barrier. The
clearest example of this is ˜ψ2 at ¯α = 2.5, which is localised around the top of the potential
barrier. As discussed in Section 5, these solutions can be interpreted as a contribution from
transitions between the two minima, during which the ﬁeld can spend a signiﬁcant amount of
time near the top of the barrier. The existence of such solutions was apparently not noticed
in Ref. [16].

(cid:29)

3.2 The large barrier limit

As can be seen from Fig. 1, in the limit a large ¯α the potential W (φ) in the eigenvalue
equation (2.1) will possess three minima separated by large barriers, which can be shown to
occur at

By making use of the approximate solutions close to the origin and/or z

, (3.5) and
(3.7) respectively, and using Fig. 3 as a guide is it possible to understand qualitatively the
large ¯α behaviour and often write analytic approximations for the eigenfunctions and -values.
Suppose an analytic function Φn(φ) that approximates the full solution. Then, by
calculating the expectation value of the eigenvalue equation (2.1) one gets an approximation
for the eigenvalue as

For example, from Fig. 3 we see that for large ¯α the n = 1 eigenfunction approaches

an antisymmetric combination of two quadratic n = 0 solutions centered at z
as given by (3.7), which implies
eigenvalues of the quadratic n = 0 solutions are zero at z
that the ﬁrst exited state has a neglibigle eigenvalue at this limit. As derived in [16], for any
large but ﬁnite ¯α the n = 1 eigenvalue is exponentially small.

Similarly, we see that the eigenfunction for n = 2 approaches the quadratic n = 0
solution at the origin, which as (3.5) shows does not result in a vanishing eigenvalue, even at

In the above for n = 4 we have only included the leading terms as the full result is quite
complicated.

The analytic approximations of this section are depicted by the red dashed curves in
the left panel in Fig. 2. As one may see, they are in very good agreement with the full results
for ¯α (cid:38) 1.

3.3 The spectral coeﬃcients

In addition to the eigenvalues, the spectral coeﬃcients are the other ingredient needed for
calculating correlators as given by Eq. (2.4) and (2.6). As an illustration in the following we
analyse the leading and next-to-leading spectral coeﬃcients for f (φ) = φ and f (φ) = φ2. A
useful dimensionless deﬁnition comes via (see Eq. (2.10))

Much like for the eigenvalues, the spectral coeﬃcients can in some circumstances be approx-
imated with analytic results at the large barrier limit, which may be deduced from section
3.2 and in particular Fig. 3.

Let us focus on f (φ) = φ ﬁrst. Because it is an odd function, only odd n contribute.
Because the ground state and the ﬁrst exited state approach symmetric and antisymmetric
combinations of the ground state of a harmonic oscillator located at z
, we may approximate
the (φ1)1 coeﬃcient as

4 The asymmetric double-well potential

Let us now move to the more general asymmetric case, with β > 0. Now, the potential V (φ)
has a single minimum if ¯α < 3(β/2)2/3, and two non-degenerate minima if ¯α > 3(β/2)2/3.
On the hand, the function W (φ), which appears in the eigenvalue equation (2.1), seems to
always have several minima. Depending on its speciﬁc form, some of the lowest eigenfunctions
may be localised at the other minima of W (φ), rather than the vacuum state located at
the minimum of the potential V (φ). These contributions would not be visible in typical
perturbation theory calculations. They can also give rise to non-trivial hierarchies between
the spectral coeﬃcients (2.5).

As an illustrative example, Fig. 4 shows the lowest eigenvalues for β = 0.5 as well as
the corresponding spectral coeﬃents for f (φ) = φ. At ¯α = 0, the lowest eigenvalue Λ1 is
localised around the vacuum state and therefore it corresponds to perturbative ﬂuctuations.

However, when ¯α becomes larger, it is overtaken by other eigenvalues which are localised
around the other minima of W (φ).

This can be seen in Fig. 5, which shows the ﬁve lowest eigenfunctions for ¯α = 1 and
β = 0.5. Even though the potential V (φ) actually has only one minimum for these parameters
(see Fig. 1), the lowest excited state localised at the minimum of the potential is n = 4. The
asymptotic form of the correlator is therefore determined by the shape of the potential away
from its minimum. However, because such states have a very small overlap with the ground
state ψ0, their spectral coeﬃcients are very small. This is discussed more in Section 5. The
eigenfunctions and -values up to n = 4 for some representative choices for ¯α and β are shown
in Figs. 8–12 in Appendix A.

5 Discussion

5.1 Length scales

In cosmology, the observable length scales correspond to comoving distances that were many
orders of magnitude longer than the Hubble length during inﬂation. We are therefore often
interested in the correlator at distances that are very long but still ﬁnite.

The asymptotic long-distance behaviour of the correlator Gf (0, r) is given by the ﬁrst
term in the spectral expansion (2.6) with a non-zero spectral coeﬃcient fn. The behaviour
is simplest if the lowest state, n = 1, has the largest spectral coeﬃcient, because then the
correlator is well approximated by a single power-law at all length scales,

Gf (0, r)

(5.1)

However, this is not always the case, and more generally, the correlator can be dominated by
a higher term n = d in the expansion at the distances of interest,

(5.4)

In particular, the short-distance behaviour of the correlator can be very diﬀerent from
its asymptotic long-distance form. To characterise that, following Ref.
[16] we deﬁne a
correlation radius to be the distance where the correlator has fallen to half of its value at
r = 1/H,

Gf (0, Rf ) =

Gf (0, 1/H) .

The non-trivial hierarchies between diﬀerent terms in the spectral expansion can be important
for cosmological observations. If there is a change in the behaviour of the correlator within
the observable scales, it can potentially be detected providing useful information about the
ﬁelds responsible for it.

5.2 Symmetric potential

In the symmetric case (β = 0) discussed in Section 3, there are two examples of this non-
trivial behaviour. The ﬁrst is that, because the lowest eigenstate n = 1 has odd parity,
the corresponding spectral coeﬃcient vanishes for all even functions. The asymptotic long-
distance behaviour of any even correlator, such as those of φ2 or the energy density, is
therefore given by the second-lowest eigenvalue Λ2. When ¯α (cid:38) 1, the diﬀerence between
them can be large, as we can see from the left panel in Fig. 2. Because Λ1 is small, the ﬁeld
itself is correlated over massively superhorizon scales, but its energy density is not, because
its correlations are determined by Λ2. The physical reason for this behaviour is that on
superhorizon scales, the system consists of domains of the two vacua, which contribute to
the ﬁeld correlator, and the correlation radius Rφ gives the typical size of these domains.
However, because both vacua have the same energy density, these domains do not give any
contribution to correlators of even quantities such as the energy density.

The second example is that, as we can see from the right panel of Fig. 2, the spectral
coeﬃcient of φ2 for the second-lowest state n = 2 falls rapidly when ¯α (cid:38) 1. This means that
although the asymptotic long-distance behaviour of any even correlator is indeed given by Λ2,
it only starts to dominate at very long superhorizon distances, and at shorter distances the
dominant contribution is given by Λ4. To understand why this happens, it is useful to look
at the corresponding eigenfunctions in Fig. 3. The higher state ψ4 is localised at the minima
of the potential, and therefore it corresponds to small-amplitude perturbative ﬂuctuations
around either vacuum state. The lower state ψ2, on the other hand, is localised on top of
the barrier, φ = 0, which shows that this contribution comes from the boundaries between
the domains. The eigenvalue Λ2 characterises the thickness of these domain walls, and the
spectral coeﬃcient is small because their volume is small compared with the volume of the
domains.

The diﬀerent behaviour of odd and even correlators is illustrated by Fig. 6, which shows
the correlation radii of φ and δφ2. As Λ1 becomes small, the ﬁeld correlation radius grows to
massively superhorizon scales. In contrast, when ¯α (cid:38) 1, the correlation radius of δφ2 starts
to decrease, ﬁrst because Λ2 grows, and then because Λ4 starts to dominate it.

If any variable has signiﬁcant correlations at distances much longer than the current
Hubble length 1/H0, they would appear as a homogeneous background value. In the case of
a symmetric potential, this happens when the domain size is larger than 1/H0, in which case

the current observable Universe would most likely be inside single domain. In that case the
observed ﬁeld correlator would be determined by the second-lowest odd eigenvalue Λ3.

5.3 Asymmetric potential

In the asymmetric case discussed in Section 4, we can see further examples of these non-trivial
hierarchies. When ¯α is small, the lowest state n = 1 corresponds to perturbative ﬂuctuations
around the true vacuum. However, as ¯α increases, other states overtake it one by one, as we
can see from Fig. 4.

Fig. 5 shows the eigenfunctions for ¯α = 1 and β = 0.5, and illustrates that for these
parameters the lowest excited state that has signiﬁcant overlap with the vacuum is n = 4.
Because of this, this state continues to have the highest spectral coeﬃcient, and therefore it
dominates the correlator at short distances. On the other hand, the asymptotic long-distance
behaviour is given by the lowest state Λ1. Because the corresponding spectral coeﬃcient is
very small, it only starts to dominate the correlator at extremely long super-horizon distances.
When the potential V (φ) has two non-degenerate minima separated by a high barrier,
the lowest state n = 1 is localised in the false vacuum state, and therefore we can interpret
it as the contribution from the domains of false vacuum which are occasionally formed. The
eigenvalue Λ1 represents the size of these domains, and the spectral coeﬃcient is suppressed
because of their rarity.

However, in the example shown in Fig. 5 this behaviour occurs even though the potential
V (φ) has only one minimum and there is therefore no false vacuum state (see Fig. 1). In
that case the lowest state n = 1 corresponds to excursions of the ﬁeld into high ﬁeld values
far away from the minimum.

As in the asymmetric case, it is possible that Λ1 is so small that the false vacuum
domains are larger than 1/H0. Then, because the true and false vacuum have diﬀerent
physical properties, the observables we would measure would depend on the vacuum we are

coeﬃcients fn would have to be computed using the false vacuum ground state ψ1 rather
than the true ground state ψ0.

5.4 Power spectrum

For cosmological observations, the power spectrum is often a more relevant quantity than the
coordinate-space correlator. Therefore it is useful to calculate the power spectrum by taking
the Fourier transform of (2.6)

When there are non-trivial hierarchies between the spectral coeﬃcients, the spectral

of δφ2
in the symmetric case. At asymptotically small wave number k, the
spectral index is given by the lowest state n = 2, but because its spectral coeﬃcient is very
small, the higher state n = 4 dominates at higher k. Comparing these two terms, we can

crossover happens at scales that were massively superhorizon during inﬂation. What this
shows is that the scale at which the spectral index changes can for some parameter values
occur at scales that are visible in the cosmic microwave background or other cosmological ob-
servations, possibly providing an important observational signature of early Universe models
involving decoupled spectator scalars.

6 Conclusions

In this work we have studied spectator scalar ﬁelds in de Sitter space with a potential of the
double-well form (1.1) by means of the stochastic spectral expansion [16]. The terms in the
expansion are determined by eigenvalues and eigenfunctions which we solve numerically. This
work is a continuation of Ref. [59] where only potentials with manifest Z2 symmetry and a
single minimum were considered. Our calculations show that also asymmetric potentials with
multiple minima can be eﬃciently studied with simple numerical methods to high precision,
implying the technique to be rather powerful and suitable for a large class of potentials. In
this vein we note two interesting possibilities that are yet unexplored: models with more
than one scalar and/or potentials with periodic boundary conditions such as for the axion.
The double-well potential has unsurprisingly a much richer structure in terms of eigen-
functions and -values than the quartic or quadratic cases. In particular, the spectrum has
states that are not localised near the minimum of the potential and which are therefore
In most cases these non-perturbative states dominate

the correlation function especially at long distances. The spectral coeﬃcients of the terms
can also be very diﬀerent, which can lead to non-trivial behaviour such as a change of the
spectral index at very long distances. If this happens at cosmologically relevant scales, it
can be observable. Interestingly, this behaviour persists even when the potential has only
one minimum. In the symmetric case, the behaviour of odd quantities (such as the ﬁeld) is
also very diﬀerent from the behaviour of even quantities (such as energy density). Together,
these eﬀects demonstrate that the naive intuition based perturbation theory is, in general,
not applicable.

Based on our analysis we conclude that spectator ﬁelds with a double-well potential

have many possibly observable and currently unexplored cosmological consequences.
