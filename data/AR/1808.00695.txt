Abstract

In this paper, we show the existence and non-existence of minimizers of the fol-
lowing minimization problems which include an open problem mentioned by Ho-
riuchi and Kumlin [20]:

First, we give an answer to the open problem when Ω = BR(0). Next, we inves-
tigate the minimization problems on general bounded domains. In this case, the
results depend on the shape of the domain Ω. Finally, symmetry breaking property
of the minimizers is proved for suﬃciently large β.

0 (Ω) is a completion of C∞

where W 1,p
c (Ω) with respect to the norm k∇(·)kLp(Ω). We
refer the celebrated work by G. H. Hardy [17]. The inequality (1) has great ap-
plications to partial diﬀerential equations, for example stability, global existence,
and instantaneous blow-up and so on. See e.g. [6], [3]. It is well-known that in
(1) ( N−p

p )p is the optimal constant and is not attained in W 1,p

On the other hand, in the critical case where p = N, the following inequality

which is called the critical Hardy inequality holds for all u ∈ W 1,N
a ≥ 1, where R = supx∈Ω |x| :

In fact, in their article [20] they mention that the
attainability of Ga is an open problem. See also [19]. Note that the continu-

In this paper, we study the existence, non-existence, and symmetry breaking
property of the minimizers of Ga. First, we give an answer to the open problem ex-
cept for a = a∗ which is a threshold number when Ω = BR(0). More precisely, we
show that there exists a minimizer of Ga for a ∈ (1, a∗) and there is no minimizer
for a > a∗. Next, we extend the results to general bounded domains. Furthermore
we investigate the positivity and the attainability of G1 in general bounded do-
mains. When a = 1, the positivity and the attainability of G1 depend on geometry
of the boundary of the domain since the potential function has singularities on
the boundary. Finally, we show that when Ω = BR(0), any minimizers of Ga are
non-radial for large β and ﬁxed q > N, and any minimizers are radial for any β
and any q ≤ N.

Our problem is regarded as the critical case of one of Caﬀarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg
type inequalities, see [20]. In the weighted subcritical Sobolev spaces W 1,p
0 (|x|αdx)
where p < N + α, the existence, nonexistence, and symmetry breaking property
of the minimizers of Caﬀarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequalities are well-studied
especially for p = 2, see [35], [26], [12], [18], [8], [9], [10], [33], [14], [16], [11]
and references therein.

Our minimization problem (4) is related to the following nonlinear elliptic

equation with the singular potential:

−div ( |∇u|N−2∇u ) = b |u|q−2u

|x| )β

u = 0

in Ω,
on ∂Ω.

The minimizer for Ga is a ground state solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation
(5) with a Lagrange multiplier b.

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, necessary preliminary facts
are presented. In section 3, we prove the (non-)attainability of Ga when Ω = BR(0)
and a > 1. In section 4, we extend the results to several bounded domains, and we
investigate the positivity and the attainability of G1 in several bounded domains.
In section 5, we show that symmetry breaking phenomena of the minimizers of
Ga occur for large β.

We ﬁx several notations: BR(0) and BN

R (0) denote a N-dimensional ball cen-
tered 0 with radius R and ωN−1 denotes an area of the unit sphere SN−1 in RN. |A|

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we give a necessary and suﬃcient condition of the positivity
of Ga for a ∈ [1, ∞). Furthermore we give the explicit value of Ga, and the min-
imizers when β = N−1
N q + 1 and q > N. First, we give a necessary and suﬃcient
condition (6) of the positivity of Ga when a > 1.

Proposition 1. Let a > 1, Ω ⊂ RN be a bounded domain with 0 ∈ Ω, R =
supx∈Ω |x|, N ≥ 2 and q, β > 1. Then Ga > 0 if and only if β and q satisfy

either β >

N − 1

q + 1 or β = N − 1

q + 1, q ≥ N.

(6)

Essentially, Proposition 1 is proved by the following theorem in [27]. The
authors in [27] show a necessary and suﬃcient condition of the positivity for more
p,q(RN). Note that the
general inequalities in the critical Sobolev-Lorentz spaces H s
N,N(RN) is equivalent to it of W 1,N(RN). We can obtain Proposition 1
norm of H1
from Theorem A and simple calculations. We omit the proof here.

Theorem A . ([27] Theorem 1.1.) Let N ∈ N, 1 < p < ∞, 1 < r ≤ ∞ and
p,r(RN),
1 < α, β < ∞. Then there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all u ∈ H

Next, we give a necessary and suﬃcient condition of the positivity of Ga when
a = 1 and Ω = BR(0). Essentially, the following proposition follows from results
in [20].

Proposition 2. Let Ω = BR(0). Then G1 > 0 if and only if β = q = N.

In §4, we extend Proposition 2 to general bounded domains. Proposition 2

follows from Proposition 4 in §4. Thus we omit the proof of Proposition 2 here.

Finally, we give the explicit value of the optimal constant Ga,rad and the mini-

mizers when β = N−1

N q + 1 and q > N.

Logarithmic transformations related to Ga,rad are founded by [20], [21], [36],
[30]. Especially, in the radial setting, the authors in [30] show an unexpected
relation (9) that the critical Hardy inequality in dimension N ≥ 2 is equivalent to
the one of the subcritical Hardy inequalities in higher dimension m > N by using
a transformation (10) as follows:

By using the transformation (10) and direct calculations, we can observe not only
an equivalence between two Hardy inequalities but also the equivalence between
Hardy-Sobolev type inequalities and generalized critical Hardy inequalities in the
radial setting as follows:

where α = m−N

a modiﬁcation of (10) when a > 1. Since the minimization problems on the right
hand side of (11) are well-known (see e.g. [35], [26]), we can obtain the following
proposition by using these transformations.

Proposition 3. Let β = N−1

0,rad(BR(0)) is a radial minimizer of Ga,rad. We can assume that u is nonnegative
without loss of generality. We shall derive a contradiction. For λ ∈ (0, 1), we
consider a scaled function uλ ∈ W 1,N

which yields that uλ is also a nonnegative minimizer of Ga,rad. On the other hand,
we can show that uλ ∈ C1(BR(0)\{0}) and uλ > 0 in BR(0)\{0} by standard regular-
ity argument and strong maximum principle to the Euler-Lagrange equation (5),
see e.g. [13], [29]. However uλ ≡ 0 in BR(0) \ Ba(1−λ−1)R(0). This is a contradiction.

Therefore Ga,rad is not attained.

Let Ω = BR(0). In this section, we prove an existence and non-existence of the

minimizers of Ga. First result is as follows.

N q + 1 and q > N, then there exists a∗ ∈ (1, e

Remark 1. If a∗ = e

assume that Ga∗ is attained by u, then u# is a radial minimizer of Ga,rad which
contradicts Proposition 3 (ii), see the proof of Theorem 1 (ii). However we do not
know the value of a∗.

In [20], a continuity of Ga with respect to a is proved for a ∈ (1, ∞). However,

in our argument, the continuity of Ga at a = 1 is needed.

Lemma 2. Ga is monotone increasing and continuous with respect to a ∈ [1, ∞).

Proof of Lemma 2. It is enough to show only the continuity of Ga at a = 1. From
m=1 ⊂ C∞
the deﬁnition of G1, we can take (um)∞

Third Lemma is concerned with the concentration level of minimizing se-

quences of Ga.

Lemma 3. Let β = N−1
where Grad is given by Proposition 3 (i).

N q + 1, q > N, and a > 1. If Ga < Grad, then Ga is attained,

It is easy to show Theorem 1 by these three lemmas. Therefore we give a proof

of Theorem 1 before showing Lemma 3.

a ≥ e
and monotone increasing with respect to a ∈ [1, ∞) by Lemma 2, there exists
N ] such that Ga < Grad for a ∈ [1, a∗) and Ga = Grad for a ∈ [a∗, ∞).
a∗ ∈ (1, e
Hence Ga is attained for a ∈ (1, a∗) by Lemma 3. On the other hand, if we assume
that there exists a nonnegative minimizer u of Ga for a > a∗, then we can show
that u ∈ C1(BR(0) \ {0}) and u > 0 in BR(0) \ {0} by standard regularity argument
and strong maximum principle to the Euler-Lagrange equation (5), see e.g. [13],
[29]. Therefore we see that

which implies that either u ≡ 0 or um → u . 0 in Lq(BR(0); fa, β(x)dx) holds

Assume that u ≡ 0. Then we claim that

Grad ≤

(14)

If the claim (14) is true, then we see that Grad ≤ Ga which contradicts the assump-
tion. Therefore u . 0 which implies that um → u . 0 in Lq(BR(0); fa, β(x)dx).
Hence we have

4. In the case of general bounded domain

We extend Theorem 1 and Proposition 2 to bounded domains. Throughout this
section, we assume that Ω ⊂ RN is a bounded domain, 0 ∈ Ω, and β and q satisfy
(6). Set R = supx∈Ω |x|.

First we extend Proposition 2 to general bounded domains.

If there exists
Γ ⊂ ∂Ω ∩ ∂BR(0) such that Γ is open in ∂BR(0), then we can obtain the same result
as Proposition 2 as follows.

Proposition 4. Assume that there exists Γ ⊂ ∂Ω ∩ ∂BR(0) such that Γ is open in
∂BR(0). Then G1 > 0 if and only if β = q = N.

11

Proof of Proposition 4. First we show that G1 = 0 if β > N−1
N q+1. Set x = rω (r =
|x|, ω ∈ S N−1) for x ∈ RN. From the assumption, we can take δ > 0 and ˜Γ ⊂ Γ
such that ˜Γ is open in ∂BR(0) and

(r, ω) ∈ [0, R) × S N−1

(

˜Γ) and φ ∈ C∞([0, ∞)) satisfy φ ≡ 1 on [R − δ, R] and φ ≡ 0 on

Next we show that G1 = 0 if β > N. Set xε = (R − 2ε) y

R for y ∈ ∂BR(0). Note

that Bε(xε) ⊂ Ω for small ε > 0 and some y ∈ Γ. Then we deﬁne uε as follows:

as ε → 0 when β > N. Hence we see that

G1 = 0 if β > N.

From (15), (16), and (6), we see that G1 > 0 if and only if q = β = N.

(16)

(cid:3)

If there does not exist Γ in Proposition 4, then we can expect that the relation
between q, β and the positivity of G1 depends on geometry of the boundary ∂Ω. In
order to see it, we consider special cuspidal domains which satisfy the following
conditions:

(Ω1) : ∂Ω ∩ ∂BR(0) = {(0, · · · , 0, −R)}.
(Ω2) : ∂Ω is represented by a graph φ : RN−1 → [−R, ∞) near the point (0, · · · , 0, −R).

Namely, for small δ > 0 the following holds true:
Qδ := Ω ∩ (RN−1 × [−R, −R + δ]) = {(x′, xN) ∈ RN−1 × [−R, −R + δ] | xN > φ(x′)}.

(Ω3) : there exist C1, C2 > 0 and α ∈ (0, 1] such that

C1|x′|α ≤ φ(x′) + R ≤ C2|x′|α for any x′ ∈ RN−1.

α in (Ω3) expresses the sharpness of the cusp at the point (0, · · · , 0, −R). Then
we can obtain the following theorem concerned with the positivity and the attain-
ability of G1.

Theorem 2. Assume that Ω satisﬁes the assumptions (Ω1) − (Ω3). Then there
α ] such that G1 = 0 for β > β∗ and G1 > 0 for
exists β∗ = β∗(α, q) ∈ [ N−1
α
β < β∗. Furthermore G1 is attained for β ∈ ( N−1

+ 1, N

N q + 1, β∗).

Remark 2. When β = q = N and 0 ∈ Ω, G1 is not attained for any bounded
domain. However, when 0 < Ω, the attainability of G1 depends on a geometry of
the boundary ∂Ω. Very recently, Byeon and Takahashi investigate the attainability
of G1 on cuspidal domains in their article [7] when β = q = N.

(ii), we can observe that Grad does not vary even if we replace W 1,N
0,rad(BR(0)) to
W 1,N
0,rad(Bε(0)) for any small ε > 0. Thus the right hand side and the left hand side
of (29) take same value, that is Grad. Therefore we have Ga = Grad. Furthermore
if we assume that Ga is attained by u ∈ W 1,N
(BR(0)) is also
a minimizer on a ball. This contradicts Theorem 1 (ii) in §2. Hence Ga is not
attained for any bounded domains Ω.
(iii) Note that Ga is continuous with respect to a ∈ (1, ∞), and is monotone in-
creasing with respect to a ∈ [1, ∞) for any bounded domains. From Lemma 4 and
Theorem 3 (ii), we can show that there exists a∗ ∈ (1, e
N ] such that Ga < Grad for
a ∈ (1, a∗) and Ga = Grad for a > a∗ in the same way as the proof of Theorem

5. Symmetry breaking

In this section, we consider radially symmetry of the minimizers of Ga when
Ω = BR(0). We can show that any minimizer of Ga has axial symmetry by using
spherical symmetric rearrangement, see [23]. Namely, for any minimizer uβ of
Ga there exists some ξ ∈ SN−1 such that the restriction of uβ to any sphere ∂Br(0)
is symmetric decreasing with respect to the distance to r ξ. See also [32]. The last
result is as follows.

Theorem 4. Let β > N−1

(i) For ﬁxed q > N, there exists β∗ such that uβ is non-radial for β > β∗.
(ii) uβ is radial for any β and q ≤ N.

In order to show Theorem 4 (i), we need two lemmas concerning growth orders

of Ga and Ga,rad with respect to β.

the following estimate holds true.

Finally we shall show Theorem 4.

Proof of Theorem 4. (i) It is enough to show that Ga < Ga,rad. By Lemma 5 and

(ii) Let x = rω (r = |x|, ω ∈ S N−1) for x ∈ BR(0). For u ∈ W 1,N
the following radial function U:

Then we have

which yields that

where the inequality follows from Jensen’s inequality and q ≤ N. From (33) and
(34), we obtain Ga,rad ≤ Ga. Therefore Ga,rad = Ga for any q ≤ N and β. Moreover
we observe that any minimizers of Ga must be radial from the equality condition
(cid:3)
of (33).
