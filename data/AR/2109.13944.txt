The emergence of superconductivity and correlated insulators in magic-angle twisted 

bilayer graphene (MATBG) has raised the intriguing possibility that its pairing 

mechanism is distinct from that of conventional superconductors1‚Äì4, as described by the 

Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. However, recent studies have shown that 

superconductivity persists even when Coulomb interactions are partially screened5,6. 

This suggests that pairing in MATBG might be conventional in nature and a consequence 

of the large density of states (DOS) of its flat bands. Here we combine tunneling and 

Andreev reflection spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to 

observe several key experimental signatures for unconventional superconductivity in 

MATBG. We show that the tunneling spectra below the transition temperature Tc are 

inconsistent with those of a conventional s-wave superconductor, but rather resemble 

those of a nodal superconductor with an anisotropic pairing mechanism. We observe a 

large discrepancy between the tunneling gap ŒîT, which far exceeds the mean-field BCS 

ratio (with 2ŒîT/kBTc ~ 25), and the gap ŒîAR extracted from Andreev reflection 

spectroscopy (2ŒîAR/kBTc ~ 6). The tunneling gap persists even when superconductivity is 

suppressed, indicating its emergence from a pseudogap phase. Moreover, the 

pseudogap and superconductivity are both absent when MATBG is aligned with 

hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). These findings and other observations reported here 

provide a preponderance of evidence for a non-BCS mechanism for superconductivity in 

MATBG. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tunneling measurements of the quasiparticle DOS, the energy gap, and electron-

phonon coupling in conventional superconductors have provided key experimental evidence for 

the BCS theory of superconductivity7. Similar measurements on correlated superconductors, 

most notably STM and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, have shown their 

properties to be qualitatively different from those of BCS superconductors8,9. For the high-Tc 

cuprate superconductors, while tunneling spectra in the overdoped regime can be captured by 

the DOS of a BCS-like model with a d-wave order parameter, the yet-to-be-understood 

pseudogap phenomenon at reduced doping causes the spectroscopic properties of the cuprates 

to strongly deviate from this picture9.   

Superconductivity has been observed at remarkably low carrier densities at partial 

fillings of the flat bands of MATBG1‚Äì3. Although these qualities suggest an unconventional 

pairing mechanism, conclusive evidence for any mechanism beyond the BCS paradigm is 

absent. We use density-tuned scanning tunneling and point-contact spectroscopy (DT-STS, DT-

PCS) to show that the superconducting phase of MATBG, specifically when hole-doping its flat 

valence band, shares a remarkable number of features with unconventional superconductors. 

Our experiments show a V-shaped gap at low temperatures and an unusual pseudogap 

precursor phase at higher temperatures and magnetic fields from which phase-coherent 

superconductivity emerges. The low-energy region of the V-shaped gap supports an anisotropic 

pairing mechanism with nodes in the superconducting gap function, as anticipated by some 

theoretical studies10‚Äì12. The pseudogap state may signify pairing without phase coherence or a 

secondary phase forming above Tc and Bc. Both the pseudogap and superconductivity are 

absent when MATBG is commensurately aligned with the hBN substrate, suggesting that the 

structural characteristics and/or the C2T-symmetry of unaligned MATBG are required for 

stabilizing these ground states. Although we cannot rule out a phonon-based pairing 

mechanism13,14, our results provide key constraints for an accurate theory of superconductivity 

in MATBG. 

We performed our experiments in a homebuilt dilution-refrigerator STM15 on devices 

sketched in Fig. 1a. MATBG, biased at Vs, rests on hBN/SiO2/Si, while a voltage Vg applied to Si 

tunes the carrier density (see Methods). Fig. 1b shows a topographic image16‚Äì18 of unaligned 

MATBG/hBN, while Fig. 1c shows DT-STS dI/dV(Vs, Vg) acquired at 250 mK at the center of an 

AA site in Device A (see SI for AB/BA data). Fig. 1c shows that the conduction (valence) flat 

band is pinned to the Fermi energy (EF; Vs = 0 V) when Vg tunes EF above (below) the charge 

neutrality point (CNP; VCNP = 3.7 V), while the valence (conduction) flat band onsets at Vs < -20 

mV (Vs > 20 mV) and displays significant energy broadening due to charge fluctuations19. At 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
millikelvin temperatures, we observe features in DT-STS attributed to a cascade of transitions at 

partial band fillings20‚Äì23, but they appear weaker and broader in energy than those observed at 

higher temperatures (T > 4 K), which may be related to high-entropy isospin fluctuations24,25. 

Distinguishing nodal superconductivity 

DT-STS shows several gapped phases (Fig. 1c) starting with band insulators at ùúà = ¬±4, 

where ùúà is the electron filling per moir√© unit cell relative to the CNP. Here we focus on partial 

fillings of the valence flat band near -3 < ùúà < -2, where transport studies1‚Äì3 report 

superconductivity in MATBG (Fig. 1c red box). Figures 1d and 1f show tunneling spectra 

dI/dV(Vs, Vg) from two devices (Device A as in Fig. 1c, and Device B), which display a gap at ùúà = 

-2 that opens and closes at EF with decreasing Vg, followed by the opening of a new gap that 

persists between -3 < ùúà < -2. The density dependence of these gaps is highlighted by dI/dV(Vs = 

0 V) as a function of Vg shown in Figs. 1d and 1f. We observe a clear transition between the two 

gapped phases, consistent with the phase diagram of MATBG from transport studies1‚Äì3,5,6 in 

which a correlated insulator (CI) at ùúà = -2 transitions into a superconductor that persists for -3 < 

ùúà < -2. In Figs. 1e and 1g, we plot tunneling gaps for the ùúà = -2 CI (red curves) and the -3 < ùúà < -

2 superconductor (blue curves) measured in each device. The -3 < ùúà < -2 tunneling gap is 

significantly larger than kBTc observed in transport experiments1‚Äì3 and is an order of magnitude 

larger than an in-plane tunneling gap observed in an MATBG p-n junction26 (presumably, the 

lateral p-n junction only probes the edge of the superconducting dome adjacent to the CI, 

instead of optimal doping, due to the junction‚Äôs doping gradient). Before examining the shapes 

of the tunneling spectra further, we discuss our method for distinguishing between gapped 

insulating and superconducting phases by complementing DT-STS with point-contact 

spectroscopy (PCS) measurements. 

Because both CIs and superconductors show suppressions in dI/dV(Vs = 0 V), we 

require complementary information that distinguishes these two phases. We performed PCS by 

reducing the tip height above the sample until the tip makes point contact with the sample 

surface (sketched in Fig. 2a) and then measuring the two-terminal tip-sample conductance 

G(Vs, Vg) (see Methods; see SI for discussion of possible tip-induced pressure and strain during 

PCS). This measurement is particularly sensitive to the local region beneath the tip (see SI). 

The point-contact zero-bias conductance G(Vs = 0 V, Vg) (PCS-ZBC), plotted in Fig. 2b (Device 

A‚Äô - a different region of Device A) as a function of Vg, vanishes at ùúà = ¬±4 and ùúà = ¬±2, signaling 

the formation of band and correlated insulators (Fig. 2b; red shaded bars). Consistent with 

transport studies1‚Äì3, the insulating states are insensitive to application of a weak out-of-plane 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
magnetic field B. In contrast, the PCS-ZBC displays enhanced intensity between -3 < ùúà < -2 

(Fig. 2b; green shaded bar) that is suppressed with increasing B, consistent with 

superconductivity in this doping range. More direct evidence for superconductivity is revealed by 

the voltage-bias dependence of PCS G(Vs, Vg) in Figs. 2c-d. These spectra are indicative of 

Andreev reflection27,28, where incoming electrons from the metallic tip are reflected as holes 

while Cooper pairs propagate into the superconducting sample (Fig. 2a). This results in 

enhanced conductance at low biases and ‚Äúexcess current‚Äù when the sample is superconducting. 

Signatures of Andreev reflection in PCS G(Vs, Vg) (black boxes in Figs. 2e-f) are limited roughly 

to fillings -3 < ùúà < -2, magnetic fields B < Bc ~ 50 mT, and temperatures T < Tc ~ 1.2 K, all of 

which are consistent with transport measurements1‚Äì3. A side-by-side comparison of STS and 

PCS (Fig. 2g) at the same sample location shows how PCS can clearly distinguish tunneling 

gaps associated with superconductivity from those associated with insulators. Despite the 

presence of many correlation-driven gaps at EF in STS, only the filling range -3 < ùúà < -2 shows 

both a V-shaped gap in STS and a zero-bias conductance peak in PCS. 

Two distinct energy scales & the pseudogap 

Both STS and PCS provide complementary evidence for an anisotropic pairing 

mechanism of superconductivity in MATBG. Moreover, these measurements establish two 

distinct energy scales. Low-energy STS spectra (Fig. 3a) are clearly incompatible with an 

isotropic s-wave pairing symmetry, and the best fits to such a model require introducing 

unphysically large quasiparticle broadening (equivalent to an electron temperature above 2 K; 

for comparison, see SI for STS on superconducting Al). Often STS spectra on MATBG have a 

finite conductance at zero energy, but V-shaped spectra with zero conductance at zero bias 

have also been observed (Fig. 1g). These STS spectra resemble the quasiparticle DOS of a 

nodal superconductor, as for higher angular momentum (e.g. p- or d-wave) pairing with an 

anisotropic gap function (Fig. 3b shows this fit for Device A, Vg = -25.8 V ‚Äì see SI for fits at other 

Vg). Although the nodal fit describes this spectrum well, one should be cautious about this 

interpretation given the similar appearance of this gap to that of the pseudogap above Tc and Bc 

described below. Nevertheless, we extract an energy scale of ŒîT ~ 0.9 meV from this fit, which 

roughly corresponds to half the separation of the shoulders in the spectrum. Similarly, the 

Andreev reflection spectra in PCS resemble predictions from the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk 

(BTK) model29 using a nodal superconducting gap function (Fig. 3c and SI). However, a BTK-

model fit yields an energy scale ŒîAR ~ 0.3 meV (Device A‚Äô: Vg = -22.8 V), 3 - 5 times smaller 

than ŒîT. For Tc ‚âà 1.2 K (measured through PCS), the observed ratio 2ŒîT/kBTc ~ 25 (Device A‚Äô; 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vg = -22.8 V) is significantly higher than the expected ratio for a tunneling gap of a BCS 

superconductor (2ŒîMF/kBTc = 3.53). The Andreev energy-scale ratio 2ŒîAR/kBTc ~ 6 also appears 

to be higher than the BCS ratio. As noted above, Andreev reflection disappears when phase-

coherent superconductivity is absent, with both ŒîAR and the Andreev excess current vanishing 

above Tc and Bc (Figs. 2d and 3d). In contrast, the STS gap ŒîT persists when phase-coherent 

superconductivity vanishes above Tc (see Fig. 3e and SI) and well-above Bc (Fig. 4). 

A similar dichotomy between the energy scales describing tunneling and Andreev 

reflection has been documented for the underdoped cuprate superconductors27, where Andreev 

reflection also tracks the onset of phase coherence at Tc while the tunneling gap persists above 

Tc, as we observe in MATBG (see high-temperature data in SI; see also Ref. 23). Compared to 

studies8,9 that examine the relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity in the 

cuprates, in MATBG, we have the advantage that application of a relatively weak B > Bc ~ 50 

mT suppresses phase coherence at low temperatures, allowing us to probe the shape of the 

pseudogap spectra with high energy resolution at the lowest temperatures. Such measurements 

in Fig. 4a show that the shapes of the spectra in the pseudogap phase remain remarkably sharp 

and surprisingly similar to those of spectra observed when the sample is superconducting. 

While the ùúà = -2 CI is suppressed below 3 T, the pseudogap remains present over most of the 

doping range -3 < ùúà < -2 (Fig. 4b). The density dependence of the STS at zero magnetic field 

and up to 3 T (see SI for 1 T data) reveals that the onset of a sharp pseudogap in the absence 

of phase-coherent superconductivity occurs when the van Hove singularity associated with the 

valence band overlaps with EF. In this situation, the gain in the exchange energy may favor the 

formation of an isospin (spin/valley) polarized/coherent ground state (or some other ordered 

state), which may be responsible for the pseudogap with sharp side-peaks shown in Fig. 4a. 

However, given the remarkable resemblance between the shapes of the STS gaps in the 

pseudogap and superconducting phases, it is also possible that such a gap is driven by the 

formation of incoherent pairs for B > Bc and T > Tc

30. Regardless of the origin, the correlations 

responsible for the pseudogap are clearly compatible with the onset of phase-coherent 

superconductivity. 

Quenching pairing and pseudogap with hBN  

Further insight regarding superconductivity and the pseudogap phase in MATBG is 

provided by studying MATBG aligned with hBN. Anecdotally, transport experiments do not 

report superconductivity in MATBG samples that are presumed to be well-aligned with hBN31,32. 

In examining the role of hBN alignment, STM studies are particularly advantageous, as they can 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
directly visualize and distinguish the graphene-graphene (G-G) and graphene-hBN (G-hBN) 

moir√© structures. Fig. 5b shows a set of representative topographic images of Device C, taken 

at different Vs and Vg in order to disentangle the different structural roles of the two moir√© 

patterns (see SI). Surprisingly, these images show perfect alignment between the AA sites of 

the G-G moir√© and the carbon-boron regions of the G-BN moir√©. This suggests a propensity for 

MATBG aligned to hBN to undergo a moir√©-scale incommensurate-commensurate transition 

when the two moir√© length scales are similar. In the schematic in Fig. 5a, we label these 

substrate-modified AA sites as ‚ÄúAAb‚Äù sites to reflect this alignment configuration. Likewise, the 

AB/BA sites of MATBG are made inequivalent by the hBN, forming ‚ÄúABa‚Äù (‚ÄúBAa‚Äù) regions where 

atoms in the top (bottom) graphene sheet are in register with atoms in the top hBN layer. This 

incommensurate-commensurate transition contrasts with the formation of a super-superlattice 

due to a long-wavelength interference between the two moir√© patterns. 

DT-STS and DT-PCS on Device C show that alignment with hBN dramatically alters the 

electronic properties of MATBG (Figs. 5c-e). In contrast to the semi-metallic behavior we 

observe in unaligned samples at the CNP, STS acquired at the center of an AAb site shows a 

gap (convolved with Coulomb charging effects) at the Dirac point due to sublattice symmetry 

breaking33‚Äì35, and the resulting insulating behavior of MATBG at the CNP is directly probed 

using PCS (Figs. 5c and 5e). In agreement with transport studies31,32, we also find correlated 

and Chern insulators at ùúà = +2 and +3, respectively (Fig. 5c; see also SI). In contrast with 

unaligned samples, aligned samples show neither a cascade of transitions nor evidence for 

superconductivity or the pseudogap, despite the twist angle of this device (1.08¬∞) being near 

those with the maximal Tc in transport measurements on unaligned devices1,5. Overall, DT-STS 

and DT-PCS show that hBN alignment is detrimental to the formation of both the pseudogap 

and the superconducting phases of MATBG, as evidenced by contrasting data in Figs. 1-2 with 

that of Fig. 5. Furthermore, the ability to identify superconductivity and a pseudogap phase in 

unaligned MATBG and their absence in MATBG aligned to hBN demonstrates the utility of our 

combined DT-STS and DT-PCS technique, since the existence of superconductivity in some 

flat-band materials36 as well as the importance of C2T symmetry37‚Äì39 is currently heavily 

contested. 

Discussion 

Cumulatively, our findings provide substantial evidence that pairing in MATBG is 

unconventional and distinct from that of a BCS mechanism. STS does not show an isotropic gap 

with a size consistent with that expected from a Tc ~ 1.2 K s-wave BCS superconductor, but 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shows a V-shaped DOS consistent with that of a nodal superconductor, where the details of the 

spectra vary with twist angle and strain (see SI). The PCS measurements corroborate this 

picture and additionally show an unusual linear suppression of the Andreev excess current 

approaching Tc (Fig. 3d). This behavior is similar to reports in other unconventional 

superconductors40,41 and has been suggested to be related to pair-breaking effects due to 

inelastic scattering from bosonic modes. There are many candidates for bosonic modes in 

MATBG, ranging from phonons to more exotic collective isospin fluctuations42; however, a key 

ingredient for this scenario is the presence of a sign-changing order parameter, which makes 

scattering from such modes pair breaking43. As an aside, if pairing is spin-triplet in nature, the 

ratio of the enhanced conductance near zero bias to the background conductance in the 

Andreev spectra is incompatible with an equal-spin-pairing order parameter (see SI). Moreover, 

like the underdoped cuprate superconductors27, MATBG shows contrasting behavior between 

the energy scales describing tunneling and Andreev reflection. Without further experiments, it is 

difficult to distinguish between different explanations for this dichotomy (i.e. a precursor broken-

symmetry phase or preformed pairing without coherence30). Overall, the experiments presented 

here provide clear constraints for constructing a model of the pairing mechanism in this novel 

electronic material that lies beyond the BCS paradigm.

Methods 

STM measurements 

STM/STS measurements were performed on a homebuilt dilution-refrigerator STM15 with 

tungsten tips prepared on a Cu(111) surface. The carrier density in MATBG was tuned by a 

gate voltage Vg applied to Si (or a graphite gate for Device C), while Vs is applied to the sample. 

dI/dV is measured through lockin detection of the AC tunnel current in response to an AC 

modulation Vrms added to Vs. Initial tunneling parameters for STS are chosen to avoid phonon-

induced inelastic tunneling44. 

We used two experimental protocols for avoiding unwanted local gating from the tip20. 

First, we used an STM tip that has been freshly prepared (field emission, pulsing, poking) and 

calibrated on a cleaned single-crystal metal, paying particular attention to protecting the tip from 

polymer residue contamination that often lies on the surface of two-dimensional (2D) material 

devices. Second, we use an STM tip and metal crystal that are made of materials (e.g. tungsten 

and copper) that are work-function-matched with graphene. Careful preparation of the tip and 

sample are essential because when polymer residue on the device‚Äôs surface attaches to the tip, 

spectroscopic features of the tunnel junction are compromised, and topographic images often 

show ‚Äúdrag patterns‚Äù caused by the motion of a particle in the tunnel junction or by flexing of the 

tip apex45‚Äì47. Since these drag patterns may be misinterpreted as tip-induced strain effects, we 

provide evidence of our clean and stable tip-sample junctions in Fig. S16 in the Supplementary 

Information. Fig. S16 shows two topographic images without a drag pattern that are essentially 

identical despite a three-orders-of-magnitude change in the junction resistance. 

PCS measurements 

PCS measurements were performed by moving the STM tip a few nanometers (relative 

to the tip height during tunneling) into the MATBG surface. This does not damage the graphene. 

Differential conductance G(Vs, Vg) is then measured through lock-in detection of the AC current 

in response to an AC modulation Vrms added to Vs, while dG/dVs(Vs, Vg) is simply the numerical 

derivative of the measured G(Vs, Vg). We note that the conductance G(Vs), appears to be 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
slightly suppressed around zero bias in the metallic state of MATBG at millikelvin temperatures, 

but this suppression vanishes at T = 1.3 K. Since this suppression is present at all Vg and at 

magnetic fields above Bc, we conjecture that this is due to non-Ohmic contact, possibly between 

the graphene and the Ti/Au electrodes. When MATBG is superconducting, the finiteness of the 

critical current and the proximity effect may also contribute to the suppression of the 

conductance around the Andreev peaks48. See the Supplementary Information for more details 

on the PCS measurements. 

The data in Figs. 2b, c, e, and f were acquired together, and the data in Figs. 2d and g 

were acquired together. Between these two sets of data, the tip was withdrawn from the 

surface, and then point contact was re-established in the same location. The temperature-

dependent data in Fig. 2d was acquired by heating the 3He-4He mixture to T = 1.3 K and then 

measuring PCS as the dilution refrigerator is cooled. The temperatures in Fig. 2d are measured 

via a RuO2 thermometer in the STM head. The tip likely drifts relative to the sample during this 

measurement. 

Since Yankowitz et al.2 has shown that superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene can 

be tuned with pressure, we examined the role of tip-induced pressure/strain during a PCS 

measurement. Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Information shows tip-height-dependent PCS, 

showing that the energy scale for Andreev reflection ŒîAR is unchanged as the tip is pressed 

further into MATBG. This, along with the fact that the density range, Tc, and Bc of 

superconductivity in PCS match those of transport experiments, verifies the one-to-one 

correspondence of STS and PCS at the same location. See Section D of the Supplementary 

Information for a further discussion. 

Sample preparation 

Devices were fabricated using a ‚Äútear-and-stack‚Äù method49 in which a single graphene 

sheet is torn in half by van der Waals interaction with hBN. The two halves are rotated relative 

to each other and stacked to form MATBG. As Device B is Device A from Ref. 20, a full 

description of the fabrication procedure can be found therein. To summarize, graphene and hBN 

are picked up with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Then, to flip the heterostructure upside down, the 

heterostructure is pressed against an intermediate structure consisting of polymethyl 

methacrylate (PMMA)/transparent tape/Sylgard 184, and the PVA is dissolved via water 

injection. The heterostructure is then transferred to an SiO2/Si chip with pre-patterned Ti/Au 

electrodes. Residual polymer is dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM), water, acetone, and 

isopropyl alcohol (IPA). This chip is annealed in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at 170 ¬∞C overnight 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 400 ¬∞C for 2 hours. Device A is prepared in a similar manner, except the PMMA is replaced 

with Elvacite 2550, and N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is added as a solvent. For Device C, the 

intermediate structure consists only of Sylgard 184 on a glass slide, and a graphite gate is 

added to the heterostructure.

A. Additional tunneling and Andreev spectroscopy measurements between ùúà = -2 and ùúà = 

-3 

In the main text, we discussed the presence of a V-shaped tunneling gap that appears at 

the same density as an Andreev reflection spectrum acquired at the same location in an 

unaligned MATBG sample. We observed this gap at millikelvin temperatures five times in four 

devices, showing slight variations in shape and size. However, none of these observed gaps 

take the shape of an isotropic s-wave superconducting gap. Fig. S1 shows dI/dV(Vs, Vg) 

displaying the ùúà = -2 gap and the -3 < ùúà < -2 gap for Device E (angle : 1.10¬∞) and Device F 

(angle : 1.10¬∞, strain : 0.1%). 

The set of 5 total observations of this STS phenomenology in the valence flat band (two 

depicted in main text Fig. 1, one depicted in main text Fig. 2, and two depicted in Fig. S1) shows 

similar realizations of the same basic phase diagram of MATBG (i.e. a correlated insulator near 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ùúà = -2 and a superconductor between ùúà = -2 and ùúà = -3). Theoretically, interlayer strain, which is 

practically unavoidable among devices fabricated with any variation of the classic ‚Äútear-and-

stack‚Äù method, is thought to strongly influence coupling in various pairing channels of different 

symmetries1, which may explain some of the more detailed difference in spectroscopy in each 

sample. However, our ability to topographically disentangle the roles of the twist angle, the 

interlayer relative strain, and the hBN alignment allows for us to identify the most robust 

spectroscopic signatures of unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. 

In Fig. S2, we show DT-PCS measurements in Device D that show Andreev reflection. 

Using BTK-model fits (Fig. S2c; see also Section E) for a nodal superconducting order 

parameter, the Andreev gap in this device reaches an optimal value of ùõ•ùê¥ùëÖ = 0.71 meV at filling 

ùúà = -2.44. In contrast to the data from Device A‚Äô in main text Fig. 2, this data shows a 

suppression of the zero-bias conductance, which is common in PCS junctions with larger barrier 

strength ùëç.2 

B. Analysis of the tunneling gaps & possible pairing symmetries for -3 < ùúà < -2 

To capture the tunneling spectra, we compare our data to that of the density of states 

(DOS) calculated using a modified BCS model, which includes the effect of quasiparticle 

lifetime, as introduced by Dynes3, as well as the possibility of anisotropic and nodal gaps. The 

Dynes model for the DOS for an isotropic s-wave superconductor is given by: 

ùúå(ùê∏)   = ùúåùëÅùëÖùëí [

|ùê∏ ‚àí ùëñùõ§|

] 

‚àö(ùê∏ ‚àí ùëñùõ§)2 ‚àí ùõ•2

where the quasiparticle broadening ùõ§ and the superconducting gap size ùõ• can be free fitting 

parameters. We model the background normal-state DOS ùúåùëÅ as either a constant or a linear 

function of energy. To include the possibility of a nodal gap in this model, we introduce the 

angular-dependent factor 

ùõ•(ùúÉ) =   ùõ•0 cos(ùëôùúÉ) 

where ùëô is the orbital angular momentum quantum number for the pair wavefunction (i.e. ùëô =

1, 2, 3 for p-, d-, and f-wave superconducting order parameters, respectively)4. The energy 

dependence of the DOS for a nodal superconductor is obtained by integrating the DOS at a 

given energy over all angles4: 

ùúå(ùê∏) =

For nonzero angular momentum scenarios (ùëô > 0), we can simplify the equation to the following 

form: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ùúå(ùê∏) =

where ùúåùë°ùëñùëù is the tip DOS, which we assume to be an energy-independent constant. In 

Supplementary Section E below, where we discuss Andreev reflection, we will extend this 

discussion to include the spin orientation of Cooper pairs and its impact on tunneling and 

Andreev spectroscopy.  

The main text Figs. 3a,b show the nodeless s-wave and nodal Dynes-formula fitting 

analyses for the gap observed at Vg = -25.8 V in Device A (this gate voltage was chosen 

because it has the least asymmetric background as the van Hove singularity shifts through EF). 

Using a least-squares regression procedure, we obtain the best fit using ùõ• = 0.90 meV for the 

nodal model (red curve).  

The nodal-superconductor fit closely matches our experimental results, aptly capturing 

the sharp V-shaped dip in the spectrum near zero bias and the sloped coherence-peak 

structures observed at the edges of the tunneling gap. In contrast, the nodeless s-wave fits 

poorly capture these two aspects of the observed tunneling gap. The quasiparticle lifetime 

broadening required for the best fit to the nodeless s-wave model (red curve in main text Fig. 

3a; ùõ§ = 0.20 meV) is much larger than that required for the nodal case (ùõ§ = 0.07 meV). 

Generally, one expects s-wave superconductors to be more robust against impurity scattering 

effects than superconductors with sign-changing order parameters, making the larger ùõ§ for the 

s-wave scenario anomalous (see for comparison, the superconducting gap of Al(100) in Fig. 

S3c). We have found no evidence for impurity scattering in our measurements to justify the 

large broadening needed for the s-wave model. In main text Fig. 3a (gray curve), we show the fit 

to our experimental data using the isotropic Dynes formula for ùõ§ fixed to the same lifetime 

broadening as used for the fit to the nodal model (ùõ§ = 0.07 meV). The comparison between 

main text Fig. 3a (both nodeless fits) and main text Fig. 3b (the nodal fit) clearly shows the 

superiority of the nodal model in capturing the features of our data. 

We also performed the same analysis on the tunneling spectrum in Device B and Device 

F (Figs. S3a and S3b). In both cases, the nodal-superconductor fits capture the features in the 

experimental curves better than for the s-wave fits. As with Device A, fits to the s-wave model 

for the data from these devices require large lifetime broadening parameters (Œì ~ 0.3 Œî). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We note that the electron-hole symmetry present in the lower panels of main text Figs. 

1e,g is not present throughout the gate-voltage range of the gap. When analyzing spectroscopy 

as a function of gate voltage in both main text Fig. 1d from Device A and main text Fig. 1f from 

Device B, we observe a van Hove singularity (vHs) below the Fermi level at fillings ùúà > -2, 

appearing at negative Vs. At fillings near ùúà = -3, this vHs appears at positive Vs, having passed 

through the Fermi level between ùúà = -2 and ùúà = -3. This high DOS feature is responsible for 

causing electron-hole asymmetry in the normal-state DOS, upon which the tunneling gap is 

superimposed at these fillings. 

In main text Fig. 3a, we chose to analyze a spectrum that is electron-hole symmetric out 

of convenience: we can fit this spectrum to a modified BCS DOS spectrum without needing to 

make assumptions about the normal-state DOS. At other gate voltages, the spectrum still 

appears V-shaped, but has significant electron-hole asymmetry that makes the fitting analyses 

less straightforward. Nevertheless, we can still do fitting analyses despite this electron-hole 

asymmetry by fitting only the low-energy portion of the spectroscopic gap (Fig. S4). A similar 

analysis to ours was used in STS studies of the high-temperature cuprate superconductors, 

where electron-hole asymmetry is consistently seen5. In Fig. S4, the nodal fits are consistently 

superior to the s-wave fits, with each nodal fit having a lower ùúí2 value than the s-wave fit to the 

same spectrum. 

C. Locality of the DT-PCS method 

DT-PCS is a highly spatially local method that is most sensitive to the region directly 

underneath the tip. Here we present experimental observations and an idealized model that 

support the idea that regions far away from the tip do not contribute significantly to the DT-PCS 

signal. 

First, the side-by-side STS-PCS of Device A‚Äô in main text Fig. 2g shows an 

unambiguous correspondence between spectroscopic gaps in tunneling dI/dV(Vg) and 

resistance features in point-contact G(Vg). This remarkable correspondence occurs despite 

significant spatial inhomogeneity in Device A‚Äô, from which measurements in main text Fig. 1c 

(1.13¬∞), main text Fig. 2 (1.01¬∞), and main text Fig. 3e (0.99¬∞) are derived. A Nomarski 

differential interference contrast (DIC) image of Device A‚Äô in Fig. S5b shows a sample with an 

area that is roughly 4400 Œºm2 (the twisted graphene covers the entire hBN substrate). If PCS 

was a measurement that averaged over the entire sample, the correspondence between STS 

and PCS seen in Fig. 2g of the main text would be absent. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Second, Figs. S5c,d show two PCS G(Vg) data sets at Vs = 0 V, obtained roughly 200 

nm away from each other in Device C. These two data sets show different transport 

phenomenology near ùúà = -1. The electronic structure of moir√© heterostructures is highly 

sensitive to properties such as twist angle, strain, and moir√©-commensurability that can spatially 

vary across a sample. Here we have demonstrated that PCS can detect an insulating state at ùúà 

= -1 in the region probed in Fig. S5d while not detecting an insulating state only 200 nm away in 

Fig. S5c. 

Third, we can understand the locality of DT-PCS by considering an idealized model on 

an azimuthally symmetric sample (schematic diagram in Fig. S5a). While this model is idealized, 

it nevertheless provides a reasonable explanation for why regions far from the tip have little 

influence on the PCS signal. Consider a two-dimensional, circular sample of radius ùëÖ centered 

at the origin (0,0) and an STM tip touching the origin with point-contact radius ùëÖ0   <<  ùëÖ. 

Consider a voltage ùëâ applied to the metallic STM tip, while the outer edge of the sample is held 

at ground ùëâ = 0. What is the voltage drop across a sample of resistivity ùúå(ùëü, ùúÉ) ‚â° ùúå(ùëü) as a 

function of radius? 

Kirchoff‚Äôs current law requires that the total current passing through every radial ring 

around the origin must be the same. Thus, for a radially symmetric current density distribution 

ùêΩ(ùëü) at two radii ùëü1,  ùëü2, we know that 

2ùúã
ùêº1 = ùëü1 ‚à´ ùêΩ(ùëü1)ùëëùúÉ
0

2ùúã
= ùëü2 ‚à´ ùêΩ(ùëü2)ùëëùúÉ

= ùêº2 . 

0

Using Ohm‚Äôs law (ùê∏(ùëü) = ùúå(ùëü) ùêΩ(ùëü)), we find a relationship between the electric field at these two 

radii: 

ùëü1ùê∏(ùëü1)
ùúå(ùëü1)

=

ùëü2ùê∏(ùëü2)
ùúå(ùëü2)

 . 

Thus, the voltage at a point in the sample at radius ùëü is as follows: 

ùõ•ùëâ ‚â° ùëâ(ùëÖ0) ‚àí ùëâ(ùëü) = ‚àí ‚à´ ùê∏(ùëü‚Ä≤)ùëëùëü‚Ä≤

The radial factor in the denominator of the integral is key to the locality of this technique. 

Regions near the tip (i.e. small ùëü‚Ä≤) contribute the most to this integral. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
D. Method and accuracy of DT-PCS measurements 

i. Additional details for DT-PCS method 

To perform PCS measurements using the STM, the STM tip is first placed within 

tunneling range of the sample using a closed current feedback loop configuration (setpoint 

parameters: Vs = -98 mV, I = 10 pA). The back gate of the sample is set to a voltage for which 

the MATBG sample is metallic. We often use a very large negative gate voltage (e.g. for a Si-

gated device, Vg ~ -60 V), which places the chemical potential of MATBG deep within the 

metallic remote band below the flat bands. This will be used later to determine whether or not 

tip-sample contact has been made. After some time (~10 minutes), once the piezoelectric 

scanner drift has reduced significantly, the current feedback loop is opened and the sample 

voltage is reduced to 1 - 2 mV. Then, the tip is manually displaced in the z-direction by a few 

nanometers, in increments of one angstrom at a time, until the current I increases to a value of 

tens of nanoamps and is stable over several minutes. The exact value of I is logged and used 

as a benchmark for achieving the same transparent barrier conditions for PCS measurements in 

different locations with the same tip. 

ii. Accuracy of DT-PCS 

For tunneling and PCS measurements, we use a passive voltage divider (1:100 for the 

DC component of Vs and 1:1000 for the Vrms lock-in modulation) for increasing the energy 

resolution by reducing the voltage noise from voltage sources. In the circuit diagram depicted in 

Fig. S7a, we use resistors for the voltage divider. For tunneling measurements, since the tip-

sample junction resistance RJ is on the order of gigaohms, the voltage-divider output is well-

approximated by

ùëâùë†ùëúùë¢ùëüùëêùëí , 

for R2 = 1 kŒ©. For the PCS measurement, however, the junction resistance RJ becomes 

comparable to R2, so the voltage across the total device resistance RT (contact resistance RC + 

junction resistance RJ) is 

ùëÖ2ùëÖùëá
(ùëÖ1 + ùëÖ2)(ùëÖùëá + ùëÖùëêùëéùëèùëôùëí) + ùëÖ1ùëÖ2

Comparing ùëâùëá to the voltage expected from a simple voltage divider  

the voltage error in the limit ùëÖ1/ùëÖ2 ‚â´ 1 is as follows:

10 kŒ© ~ 25 kŒ©, indicating that the Andreev gaps ùõ•ùê¥ùëÖ may be overestimated by as much as 

~10%. 

iii. Tip-induced pressure and strain 

Pressure6 and strain7 influence the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene. For 

example, Yankowitz et al.6 showed that GPa pressures are able to induce superconductivity in a 

non-magic-angle sample (1.27¬∞) that did not superconduct at zero pressure. In principle, 

because the narrow magic-angle condition arises from fine-tuning of the energies of the 

interlayer and intralayer hopping processes8, it is possible that applied pressure converts a 

superconducting magic-angle sample into a sample without superconductivity. Hence, it is 

important to consider whether pressure and strain induced by the tip during a PCS 

measurement affects the electronic properties of MATBG. In our study, we can identify that our 

sample is magic-angle through STM topography and spectroscopy, and yet the point-contact 

measurement still shows Andreev reflection, indicating that pressure from the tip did not 

extinguish superconductivity in our devices. Moreover, Fig. S6a shows that the Andreev energy 

scale does not change even when we push the STM tip 5 nm deeper into the sample. 

We note that the remarkable correspondence between DT-STS and DT-PCS in main 

text Fig. 2g seems to indicate that pressure and strain from the tip does not have a significant 

effect on the overall phase diagram of our device. This can be explained by the fact that the 

easily deformable STM tip (the apex of which is mostly copper) bends into the surrounding 

empty space as the tip is pushed into the sample. 

Mesple et al.9 documents the influence of tip-induced strain in twisted bilayer graphene 

in the tunneling regime. Figs. 3a, b, and c in Mesple et al. show a series of topographic images 

at different tunnel resistances (1.75 GŒ©, 0.55 GŒ©, and 0.15 GŒ©) to demonstrate the impact of 

bringing the tip closer to the surface. Under our tip conditions (see Methods for information on 

how we prepare our STM tip), we do not observe the tip-induced strain reported by Mesple et al. 

Fig. S16 shows topographic images at tunneling resistances 20 GŒ© and 0.02 GŒ© that are 

essentially identical-looking. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
E. Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) fitting of the Andreev spectrum between ùúà = -2 and ùúà 

= -3 

To fit PCS spectra, we employ a modified version of the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk 

(BTK) fitting function, which can also include the possibility of an anisotropic superconducting 

order parameter. Because the Andreev reflection process is sensitive to the phase of the 

superconducting order parameter, the propagation direction of impinging electrons upon a 

normal-superconductor junction, with respect to the crystallographic axes of the superconductor, 

greatly affects the theoretically predicted PCS spectrum. MATBG is a 2D system, and the tip-

sample junctions in PCS are only made along the axis that is normal to the plane (the so-called 

‚Äúc-axis‚Äù). This forbids contributions of any sign-changing Andreev reflection processes towards 

the measured Andreev spectrum10. 

Andreev reflection spectra of an anisotropic superconductor are characterized by the 

BTK formula10,11, which gives the normalized, dimensionless conductance ùúéùëÖ(ùê∏) at the 
quasiparticle energy ùê∏ as a function of the quasiparticle lifetime broadening ùõ§ at a given incident 

angle ùúÉ of an electron: 

ùúéùëÖ(ùê∏) =  

1 + ùúèùëÅ|Œì+|2 + (ùúèùëÅ ‚àí 1)|Œì+Œì‚àí|2
|1 + (ùúèùëÅ ‚àí 1)Œì+Œì‚àí exp(ùëñùúë‚àí ‚àí ùëñùúë+)|2  .

 , and ùõ∫¬± = ‚àö(ùê∏ ‚àí ùëñùõ§)2 ‚àí |ùõ•¬±|

. ùõ•+ and ùõ•‚àí are effective pair potentials, 

which are felt by hole-like quasiparticles and electron-like quasiparticles, respectively, and ùúë+ 

and ùúë‚àí are their corresponding phases. We use the 1D-BTK limit, where the barrier 

transparency parameter contains no geometrical factors: 

ùúèùëÅ =

1
1 + ùëç2  . 

In the c-axis PCS analysis, ùõ•+ = ùõ•‚àí, ùúë+ = ùúë‚àí and ùõ§+ = ùõ§‚àí. In the nodeless s-wave case (Fig. 

S9b, left panel), the order parameter is isotropic, so pair potentials become ùõ•+ = ùõ•‚àí = ùõ•0. In the 

nodal d-wave case (Fig. S9b, right panel), the order parameter is anisotropic, so the effective 

pair potential is ùúã-periodic in the azimuthal plane: 

The total conductance is obtained via integration over azimuthal angles: 

 ùõ•+ = ùõ•‚àí = ùõ•0 cos(2ùúô).

  . 

For the spin-triplet case, we consider a 2 x 2 matrix form for the gap function12,13: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
‚àÜÃÇ(ùëò) = (

‚àÜ‚Üë‚Üë(ùëò) ‚àÜ‚Üë‚Üì(ùëò)
‚àÜ‚Üì‚Üë(ùëò) ‚àÜ‚Üì‚Üì(ùëò)

)  . 

In an equal-spin-pairing (ESP) spin-triplet (or ferromagnetic) superconductor, ‚àÜ‚Üë‚Üë(ùëò) or ‚àÜ‚Üì‚Üì(ùëò) =
Œî0(ùëò)  and ‚àÜ‚Üë‚Üì(ùëò) = ‚àÜ‚Üì‚Üë(ùëò) = 0. In this situation, the DOS of one spin population is given by the 

Bogoliubov-quasiparticle DOS, while the DOS of the other spin population is given by the 

normal-state DOS. 

In an ESP superconductor, the tunneling conductance in the gap is due to the existence 

of the normal-state tunneling channel. This makes the conductance minimum no smaller than 

half of the normal-state DOS. By the same analogy, Andreev reflection occurs only for electrons 

of one spin-type, so the maximum conductance of the Andreev reflection spectrum in the gap 

cannot exceed 1.5 times the normal-state conductance. This is in contrast to the zero-bias 

conductance doubling expected for spin-singlet superconductors.  

In main text Figs. 1e and 1g, the zero-bias conductance of the tunneling gap is much 

lower than half of the background conductance, while in the PCS spectroscopy in Fig. S9c, the 

maximum conductance of the normalized conductance is more than 50% larger than the 

background conductance. These observations rule out an ESP triplet superconductor scenario 

in MATBG. Thus, in the spin-triplet case, we use the opposite spin pairing (OSP) gap function, 

‚àÜÃÇ(ùëò) = (

). 

The dimensionless conductance ùúéùëÖ‚Üë,‚Üì(ùê∏) for each spin and the total conductance ùúé(ùê∏) are12 

ùúéùëÖ‚Üë(ùê∏) = ùúéùëÖ‚Üì(ùê∏) =

We use the gap function ùõ•+ = ùõ•‚àí = ùõ•0 cos ùúô for the p-wave case and ùõ•+ = ùõ•‚àí = ùõ•0 cos(3ùúô) for 

the f-wave case. The functional form becomes analytically equal to that of the d-wave case for a 

c-axis PCS measurement. Since the d-wave Dynes function fully captures the tunneling 

spectrum calculated from a d-wave BTK theory, the p- or f-wave Dynes function used in 

Supplementary Section B also provide a reasonable model to analyze the tunneling data. 

At finite temperature, the point-contact conductance of the superconducting state ùúéùëÜ(ùëâ) 

can be represented by:

We compensate for the normal-state tip-sample resistance and non-ohmic electrode-sample 

contact resistances (or ‚Äòspreading resistance‚Äô) by normalizing each spectrum using data 

obtained when the sample is in the normal state at B = 0.5 T > Bc. The normalized conductance 

can be represented as: 

ùúéùëÜ(ùëâ)
ùúéùëÅ(ùëâ)
where ùúéùëÜ, ùúéùëÅ, ùúéùê∂ and ùê∫ are the tip-sample junction conductance in the superconducting state,

the tip-sample junction conductance in the normal state, sample-electrode contact conductance, 

and the total (contact + junction) conductance, respectively. 

We can acquire the normalized point-contact conductance ùúéùëÜ/ùúéùëÅ and rule out contact 

conductance effects (that is, omitting the second multiplicative factor above) when the 

contribution of the contact conductance is dominant in the second multiplicative factor above. 

We show the tip-sample junction conductance to be much smaller than the sample 

contact conductance by using the normalized zero-bias conductance as a direct indicator of the 

quality of our sample contact. In the limit of a perfectly transparent tip-sample junction (ùëç = 0) at 

T = 0 and ùõ§ = 0,  

Experimentally, we find a smaller value for this ratio: 

ùúéùëÜ(ùëâ = 0 )/ùúéùëÅ(ùëâ  =  0) = 2.  

ùúéùëÜ(ùëâ = 0 )/ùúéùëÅ(ùëâ  =  0) ‚âà 1.6.  

Thus, in the worst-case scenario, ùúéùê∂ > 3ùúéùëÅ, which indicates that contact conductance 

dominates junction conductance in the second multiplicative factor, and normalized

A comparison between the nodeless s-wave fit and the nodal-superconductor fit is 

depicted Fig. S9c. There are two dip features near Vs = ¬±0.5 mV that are not captured by the 

BTK model, which are thought to originate from critical current effects14. Besides this shared 

discrepancy, both fits match the measured data at large bias voltages, but only the nodal fit 

matches near zero bias. Thus, these fits of the Andreev spectrum, considered in conjunction 

with fits of the tunneling spectra presented in previous sections and in the main text, indicate a 

nodal nature of the superconducting order parameter in this system. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
F. Temperature-dependence of the excess current in PCS data 

For a perfectly transparent (ùëç = 0) point-contact junction between a normal-metal tip and 

a superconducting sample, Andreev reflection results in a two-fold increase in the conductance 

at zero-bias, measured with respect to the normal state, due to the conversion of impinging 

electrons into transmitted Cooper pairs and reflected holes at the boundary. In the point-contact 

measurement in ballistic limit, this process enhances the current flowing through the circuit 

when ùëâ > ùõ•, which is called the ‚Äúexcess current‚Äù15. According to the BTK theory, the excess 

current in an isotropic BCS superconductor should be proportional to ùõ•ùúéùëÅ, which is determined 

by the barrier strength parameter ùëç. The data in main text Fig. 3c shows a temperature-

dependent dip in the normal conductance around Vs = ¬±0.75 mV, which makes it difficult to 

extract the excess current contribution directly from the measured sample current. In addition, 

we would like to neglect critical current effects described in Section E at higher bias voltages, 

which would also impede the extraction of the pure excess current from Andreev reflection. 

In order to remove the combined conductance contribution from the normal-state and the 

critical current effect in the excess current, we estimate the excess current at Vs = 2ùõ•ùê¥ùëÖ, as 

extracted from the BTK fit performed at optimal doping, base temperature, and zero magnetic 

field. The excess current, shown in main text Fig. 3c, makes use of an estimate of the normal-

state conductance via a linear interpolation between two spectra taken when MATBG is 

metallic: one taken at 200 mT and 299 mK, and one taken at 0 T and T = 1.3 K (Fig. S10a). 

These spectra do not show signatures of Andreev reflection. By subtracting each linearly 

interpolated normal conductance estimate from each Andreev spectrum at a given temperature, 

and subsequently integrating this new spectrum from Vs = 0 V to Vs = 2ùõ•ùê¥ùëÖ, the excess current 

is calculated as follows: 

ùêºùëíùë•ùëê(ùëâùë†) = ùêºùëÜ(ùëâùë†) ‚àí ùêºùëÅ(ùëâùë†) = ‚à´ (ùúéùëÜ(ùëâ‚Ä≤) ‚àí ùúéùëÅ(ùëâ‚Ä≤)ùëëùëâ‚Ä≤

confirm that this linearity shown in main text Fig. 3d does not come from the normal-state 

conductance interpolation, we plot the ùêºùëÜ(ùëâùë† = 2ùõ•ùê¥ùëÖ) in Fig. S10b, which also shows a linear-in-T 

dependence of the excess current. 

In addition, we extract the energy gap ùõ•ùê¥ùëÖ using a BTK fitting analysis of the 

temperature-dependent point-contact spectra shown in Fig. 2d of the main text. We employ a 

similar background subtraction to the second method discussed above, this time dividing by the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
linearly interpolated normal-state conductance spectrum for each Andreev spectrum (the BTK 

model accepts the dimensionless input ùê∫/ùê∫ùëÅ(ùëâ)). We fix the barrier transparency parameter ùëç = 

0.1, which was extracted from the base-temperature Andreev spectrum (Fig. S10c). Fig. 3d of 

the main text show ùõ•ùê¥ùëÖ extracted from this BTK fitting analysis, where error bars represent one 

standard deviation. We find excellent agreement between the Andreev energy gap estimate of 

Tc ‚âà 1.1 K and the linear excess current estimate of Tc ‚âà 1.15 K, which provides internal 

consistency for our interpretation. 

We note that the temperature values in Fig. 2d of the main text are readings from a 

calibrated RuO2 thermometer embedded in the STM head a few centimeters away from the 

sample. The T = 1.3 K and T = 300 mK PCS measurements are steady-state temperatures. 

However, the PCS measurements at intermediate temperatures are not steady-state, but are 

acquired while slowly cooling the microscope from 1.3 K to base temperature (i.e. spectra for 

intermediate temperatures are acquired without settling at each individual temperature). 

However, as soon as the thermometer value reached 300 mK, the measured PCS zero-bias 

conductance immediately stopped increasing in intensity (i.e. the Andreev spectrum stopped 

changing), implying good agreement between the sample and thermometer temperatures. 

G. Spatial dependence of tunneling spectroscopy on AA sites and AB/BA sites 

To examine the spatial dependence of the tunneling spectroscopy, we acquired STS on 

different AA sites within a region of our device with a uniform twist angle and strain condition. 

The tunneling spectra in Fig. S12 b-e do not show significant spatial dependence. The energy 

and the shape of the tunneling gaps are similar to each other. These are indicative of the 

homogeneity of our spectroscopic measurements across the moir√© superlattice, and helps us 

correlate our measurements to those of global transport measurements. We also measured 

tunneling spectra on AB/BA sites in Device B (Fig. S13a and S13b). Tunneling spectroscopy on 

AB sites also show a tunneling gap between -3 < ùúà < -2 that is quite similar to that observed on 

AA sites. Figs. S13c-e show the results of a spectroscopy line cut across an AA site (from an 

AB site to a BA site). The size of the -3 < ùúà < -2 tunneling gap is independent of the spatial 

position. 

H. Pseudogap regime for -3 < ùúà < -2 at high temperatures 

At millikelvin temperatures, we observe a V-shaped gap in STS that is coincident with an 

Andreev reflection spectrum in PCS within the superconducting density regime of MATBG. In 

several samples, we have identified a suppression of the DOS at the Fermi level in this density 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
range at temperatures above the critical transition temperature of MATBG. Figs. S14a-c show 

tunneling dI/dV(Vs,Vg) acquired at high temperatures, all above 4.1 K, that show a suppression 

in the valence band at EF. We interpret this suppression as a signature of a high-temperature 

pseudogap phase. 

I. Topographic analysis of MATBG aligned to hBN 

We acquired STM topographic images (main text Fig. 5b) at various values of the 

sample bias and gate voltage in order to distinguish the G-G and G-hBN moir√© patterns. When 

the MATBG flat bands are emptied (Vg = -8 V), topographic images of the filled states highlight 

the G-hBN moir√© (main text Fig. 5b; bottom left). This image shows the typical triangular lattice 

of darkened regions (carbon-boron sites) that are seen when monolayer graphene is aligned to 

hBN16‚Äì20, while the AA sites of the G-G moir√© are significantly less prominent because the 

spectral weight of the flat bands (which are empty) are highly localized to the AA sites. On the 

other hand, when the MATBG valence flat band is filled (Vg = 0 V), the AA sites of the G-G 

moir√© are highly prominent (main text Fig. 5b, top right). This image shows the typical triangular 

lattice of bright regions (AA sites) that is seen in twisted bilayer graphene. From the moir√© 

length scale seen in these images, we deduce that the G-G twist angle is 1.08¬∞, while the G-

hBN twist angle is 0.5 ¬± 0.1¬∞ (assuming a graphene-hBN atomic lattice constant ratio of 

1.01721). 

Overall, these topographic images show that when the G-G and G-hBN moir√© length 

scales are similar, perfect commensurability between the two moir√© patterns is a physically 

possible scenario, in contrast to the formation of a super-superlattice documented previously22. 

Theoretical studies21,23,24 have suggested that moir√©-commensurability is important for realizing 

a zero-magnetic-field Chern insulating state, which we discuss in Section J. 

J. Zero-field Chern insulator in moir√©-commensurate MATBG aligned to hBN 

In the main text, we noted that the insulating gap at ùúà = +3 has a Chern number C = 1. 

We provide evidence for this claim here through a method presented in Refs.25,26. Figs. S15a,d 

show two dI/dV(Vs, Vg) data sets (acquired on AAb sites) from two similar regions of Device C 

that are both moir√©-commensurate, and Figs. S15b,c are zoomed-in dI/dV(Vs, Vg) near ùúà = +3. 

Fig. S15e shows the ùúà = +3 gap moving to higher gate voltages as the out-of-plane magnetic 
field is increased from 0 T to 4 T. Since ùëëùëõ

center of an AA site in Device E (angle : 1.10¬∞) at zero magnetic field. An insulating gap with 

Coulomb charging effects opens near Vg = -15 V and closes near Vg = -19 V (i.e. surrounding ùúà 

= -2). A second gap reopens below ùúà = -2 and persists to near ùúà = -3. The gap between -3 < ùúà < 

-2 is less clear due to the slightly compromised tip condition. b, Similar tunneling dI/dV(Vs, Vg) 

and spectroscopy line cut at Vg = -26.2 V acquired at the center of an AA site in Device F 

(angle : 1.10¬∞, strain : 0.1%) at zero magnetic field. A gap with Coulomb charging effects opens 

near Vg = -18 V and closes near Vg = -23 V (i.e. surrounding ùúà = -2). A second gap reopens 

below ùúà = -2 and persists to near ùúà = -3. Between -3 < ùúà < -2, spectra show prominent 

coherence peaks that flank both sides of the gap. In both spectroscopy line cuts in a and b, the 

tunneling gaps do not show conventional s-wave features.

contact spectra G(Vs) in Device D (angle : 1.06¬∞) at T = 200 mK, B = 0 T, and at nine gate 

voltages between Vg = -26 V and Vg = -34 V. In this device, the Andreev spectrum onsets 

smoothly, widening in energy to an optimal doping near Vg = -30.5 V, and then closes. b, Point-

contact spectroscopy G(Vs,Vg) in Device D at four magnetic-field strengths between 0 T and 300 

mT. The critical magnetic field, as measured by the Andreev spectrum, is slightly higher than 

200 mT. A persistent zero-bias suppression at 300 mT may indicate residual resistance in either 

the tip-sample junction or the sample contact electrode. c, BTK fitting analysis of the normalized

the low-energy part of eleven tunneling spectra taken from a from Vg = -24 V to Vg  = -28 V. 

Curves are offset by 6.7 nS for clarity. For evaluating the goodness of each fit, ùúí2 divided by the 

number of degrees of freedom (ùúí2/ùëëùëì) is evaluated for each curve. When comparing s-wave 

and nodal fits performed on the same spectrum at every gate voltage, the nodal fits are 

consistently superior, with each nodal fit showing a lower ùúí2/ùëëùëì value than the corresponding s-

wave fit. d, same as b, but with quasiparticle lifetime broadening ùõ§ of nodal fit for corresponding

obtained at Vg = -30 V, B = 0 T, and T = 200 mK in Device D. Between each spectrum, the STM 

was vertically displaced by 1-2 nm. Here, Œîz is the tip height relative to the bottom curve (i.e., 

the largest tip-sample separation shown). As the STM tip comes into contact with the 

superconducting MATBG sample, the V-shaped dip transforms into a double-peaked Andreev 

spectrum. The barrier strength parameter Z for this tip contact is larger than that of main text 

Fig. 2 but similar to that of Fig. S2. The energy difference of the two peaks of the Andreev 

spectral feature which is around ~2Œîc and is independent of the vertical tip displacement over 

Œîz ~ 5 nm (spectra labeled ‚Äú3 nm‚Äù to ‚Äú8 nm‚Äù). b, Point-contact spectra G(Vs) obtained at Vg = -

30.4 V, B = 0 T, and T = 265 mK in Device G. Larger values of Œîùëß correspond to the tip 

displaced deeper into the surface. The evolution of the PCS with Œîùëß is nonmonotonic, possibly 

because the tip deforms as it is pressed into the surface. c, PCS line cuts at select values of Œîùëß

electrode-device contact resistance and the tip-sample junction resistance, respectively. We 

refer to the series combination of RC and RJ as RT. In PCS, RT is comparable to R2, so the 

output voltage of the voltage divider Vout can be smaller than 1/100 of the source voltage. b, The 

voltage error with respect to the expected sample bias voltage Vs = Vsource/100, plotted as a 

function of RT. In our measurements, RT falls within the range between 10 kŒ© and 25 kŒ©, which

the same location in Device A‚Äô. dI/dV(Vs, Vg) shows the opening and closing of the correlated 

insulating and superconducting phases at the Fermi level. G(Vs, Vg) allows us to differentiate 

between the origins of these two tunneling gap region, where Andreev reflection (orange peak 

near EF) occurs only in the superconducting phase, in contrast to the gapped spectroscopic 

feature (purple dip near EF) that marks the onset of the correlated insulating phase. b, Tunneling

spectrum at -3 < ùúà < -2. a, Point-contact spectrum G(Vs) at Vg = -21 V at B = 0 T (blue) and B = 

0.5 T (red) in Device A‚Äô. The blue curve is peaked at zero-bias, indicative of the Andreev 

reflection process at B = 0 T. The red curve shows a weak minimum at zero-bias, indicative of 

residual resistance in the tip-sample junction or the sample contact, as the sample has entered 

the normal state at B = 0.5 T. Normalized data ùê∫/ùê∫ùëÅ for the BTK model is obtained by dividing 
the 0 T superconducting-state data by the 0.5 T normal-state data. b, Comparison of BTK 

simulations of c-axis transport between a normal-metal tip and an s-wave (left) or nodal (right) 

superconducting sample, plotted for various barrier strength parameters ùëç. The s-wave model 

shows a flat-top-shaped spectrum when ùê∏  <  ùõ• with a doubled conductance at ùëç  = 0, while the 

nodal-superconductor (nodal-SC) model shows a point-shaped spectrum with a doubled 

conductance only at ùê∏ = 0 and ùëç = 0. c, BTK-model fitting of a normalized spectrum from the 

data in a, using an s-wave (left) and a nodal (right) superconducting order parameter. ùõ•, ùõ§, and 

ùëç are free fitting parameters. Red dashed-line boxes highlight the apex of the peaks in each 

plot, where there is the largest discrepancy between the s-wave and the nodal fits (insets). In 

addition, the broadening in the s-wave scenario is large (ùõ§ > 0.2ùõ•), while the broadening in the 

nodal scenario is reasonable (ùõ§ ‚âà 0.08ùõ•).

interpolation between a spectrum taken in Device A‚Äô at T = 299 mK, B = 250 mT and a spectrum 

taken at T = 1.3 K, B = 0 T. The excess current depicted in main text Fig. 3d is calculated by 

subtracting the integral of each Andreev spectrum with respect to the bias voltage from the 

integral of these interpolated normal-state spectra. b, Temperature dependence of the 

superconducting-state current Is at V = 2ùõ•0, where ùõ•0= 0.3 meV is the gap size extracted from 

the PCS data at 299 mK. This shows a linear relationship between Is and T. c, BTK fits of the 

normalized PCS spectra at T = 299 mK, used to estimate the barrier strength parameter ùëç in s-

wave (left) and nodal (right) superconductor scenarios, with free fitting parameters ùõ•, ùõ§ and ùëç. 

 Nodal superconductor fits better than s-wave. Thus, we use nodal superconductor fits with Z ~ 

0.1 extracted from this fit for temperature dependent BTK analysis in main text Fig. 3c.

Curves are offset by 7.5 nS for clarity. Although this is above the critical magnetic field for

location. Gray dashed lines highlight the location of the AB(BA) site (distance = 0 nm) and the 

AA site (distance = 6 nm). e, dI/dV(Vs) spectra at AA site (top), and dI/dV(Vs) spectra at AB(BA) 

site (bottom).

Figure S14 | Tunneling spectroscopy of the pseudogap phase at temperatures above 4 K. 

a, Tunneling dI/dV(Vs,Vg) acquired at the center of an AA site in Device A'' (0.99¬∞) at zero 

magnetic field and T = 4.1 K. A spectral suppression near EF appears in the valence flat band 

around ùúà < -2, which we attribute to a high-temperature pseudogap state at this temperature. b, 

Tunneling dI/dV(Vs,Vg) acquired at the center of an AA site in Device E' (very nearly the same 

area as Device E millikelvin data; 1.01¬∞) at zero magnetic field and T = 6.7 K. A spectral 

suppression near EF appears in the valence flat band around -3 < ùúà < -2, which we attribute to 

the pseudogap state. c, Tunneling dI/dV(Vs,Vg) acquired at the center of an AA site in Device B' 

(different area in Device B; 1.08¬∞) at zero magnetic field and T = 4.2 K. A gap-like spectral 

suppression near EF appears in the valence flat band around -3 < ùúà ‚â§ -2, which we attribute to 

the pseudogap state.

Figure S15 | Tunneling spectroscopy and Chern characterization of moir√©-commensurate 

MATBG aligned to hBN. a, Tunneling dI/dV(Vs,Vg) acquired at the center of an AAb site in a 

moir√©-commensurate region of Device C (1.08¬∞ G-G twist angle, 0.1% G-G interlayer strain, 0.5 

¬± 0.1¬∞ G-hBN twist angle). A ùê∂2-symmetry-broken gap, a correlated insulator gap, and a 

correlated Chern C = +1 gap appear near ùúà = 0, +2, and +3, respectively. b, Zoomed-in 

dI/dV(Vs,Vg) from a to highlight the observed zero-field Chern C = +1 gap. c, Zoomed in 

dI/dV(Vs,Vg) from d to highlight the observed zero-field Chern C = +1 gap. d, Tunneling 

dI/dV(Vs,Vg) acquired at the center of an AAb site in Device C‚Äô (same as Device C, at a different 

sample location; 1.10¬∞. A ùê∂2-symmetry-broken gap and a correlated Chern C = +1 gap appear 

near ùúà = 0 and +3, respectively. e, Tunneling dI/dV(Vs,Vg) at five different magnetic-field 

strengths between 0 T and 4 T, at around ùúà = +3. We observe a correlated Chern C = +1 state 

at and emanating from ùúà = +3. We also observe weaker signatures of a topological gapped 

phase with Chern number -2, which is first resolved at 1 T.
