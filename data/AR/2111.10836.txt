Isochronous mass spectrometry (IMS) at heavy-ion storage rings is a powerful tool for mass measurements
of short-lived nuclei. In IMS experiments, masses are determined through precision measurements of the rev-
olution times of the ions stored in the ring. However, the revolution times can not be resolved for the particles
with nearly the same mass-to-charge (m/q) ratios. In order to overcome this limitation and to extract the accu-
rate revolution times for such pairs of ion species with very close m/q ratios, the amplitudes of timing signals
from the detector, based on the emission of secondary electrons, have been analyzed in our early work on the
particle identiﬁcation. Here, the previous data analysis method is further improved by taking into account the
signal amplitudes, the detection efﬁciencies, as well as the number of stored ions in the ring. A sensitive Z-
dependent parameter is introduced in the data analysis, leading to a better resolution of 34Ar18+ and 51Co27+
with A/Z = 17/9. The mean revolution times of 34Ar18+ and 51Co27+ are deduced although their time differ-
ence is merely 1.8 ps. The uncorrected, overlapped peak of these ions has FWHM=7.7 ps. The mass excess of
51Co is re-determined to be −27332(41) keV in agreement with the previous value of −27342(48) keV.

INTRODUCTION

Isochronous mass spectrometry (IMS) at heavy-ion stor-
age rings plays an important role in mass measurements of
short-lived nuclei [1, 2]. There are three storage ring facil-
ities conducting such experiments worldwide [3–6], namely
the experimental cooler-storage ring (CSRe) in Lanzhou, the
experimental storage ring (ESR) in Darmstadt and the Rare-

in-ﬂight ﬁssion nuclear reactions, where the production cross
sections are related to the binding energies of the fragments

[7–9]. The reaction products of interest are selected with a
fragment separator and injected into the storage ring for mass
measurements. The revolution times of the stored nuclides
are directly related to their mass-to-charge (m/q) ratios. The
revolution times are typically measured by using dedicated
timing detectors [10–13]. It is obvious that only those rev-
olution times which could unambiguously be assigned to a
speciﬁc ion species can be used [14, 15].

Particle identiﬁcation (PID) is a prerequisite in experiments
with radioactive ion beams (RIB) produced in a nuclear reac-
tion, and is routinely accomplished along a RIB beam-line
by measuring the time-of-ﬂight (TOF), energy loss (∆E), and
magnetic rigidity (Bρ) for each particle [16, 17]. In particular,
the atomic number Z is mainly determined by using the ∆E
value which is usually measured with various ionisation-type
detectors placed along the beam-line.

Among the storage-ring based facilities, PID within a
beam-line can only be done at the R3 in RIKEN [18, 19],
where the quasi-DC beam from the superconducting cy-
clotron is employed. Thus, the RIBs can indeed be identiﬁed
on the event-by-event basis prior to their injection into the
R3 . It is very different in the cases of the CSRe and ESR.
The driver accelerator at the facility in Lanzhou is the heavy-
ion synchrotron CSRm [20]. The primary beams are fast ex-
tracted from the CSRm within ∼300 ns. Correspondingly the
produced RIBs have a similar bunched structure. Therefore,
the event-by-event PID is not feasible in the radioactive-ion
beam line RIBLL2 connecting the CSRm and the CSRe. Sim-

ilar situation is at GSI in Darmstadt, where the ions are fast-
extracted from the heavy-ion synchrotron SIS-18, analyzed
in ﬂight with the fragment separator FRS and injected for
isochronous mass measurements into the experimental stor-
age ring ESR [21]. In this work we examine the sensitivity
of the timing detectors to the charge of the stored ions for the
purpose of the in-ring PID.

By using IMS at the CSRe, masses of more than 30 short-
lived nuclei have been measured [22–32]. For a recent re-
view the reader is referred to Refs. [5, 6, 27] and references
cited therein.
In these experiments, the ions are identiﬁed
almost solely through their m/q ratios by comparing the rev-
olution time spectrum obtained experimentally with the simu-
lated one [14, 15]. The m/q resolving power of ∼ 3×105 has
been achieved at the CSRe, which e.g. is sufﬁcient to iden-
tify the isomeric states in 101In and 52Co [24, 28]. However,
for some pairs of ions with very similar m/q ratios, such as
51Co27+ and 34Ar18+, the revolution times are too close to
each other to be resolved clearly. The charge determination
can provide crucial information for PID in these cases. The
charge-resolved IMS was developed by analyzing the aver-
age amplitudes of signals from the timing detector induced
by stored ions [33]. This method was used successfully to
determine for the ﬁrst time the mass of 51Co. Although the
charge difference (∆Z) of 51Co27+ and 34Ar18+ is relatively
large, some events could not be unambiguously identiﬁed due
to the limited charge resolution in that work [33].

A higher charge resolution is desired. For example, masses
of 54,56Ti nuclides have been measured in an earlier experi-
ment at the CSRe [23, 29]. The 55Ti nuclide must have been
produced with a signiﬁcant amount in this experiment accord-
ing to the yields of neighbouring nuclei, but it could not be
separated from 50Ca. To measure the mass of 55Ti, it is nec-
essary to resolve 55Ti22+ and 50Ca20+ by charge, where ∆Z
is merely 2. Such high charge resolution was not realized in
that experiment. Due to the limited charge resolution, mass
measurements of N = Z nuclides with conventional IMS at
the CSRe or ESR are usually regarded to be unfeasible. The
N = Z nuclides with ∆Z = 2 have to be resolved by charge,
while the neighbouring N = Z (∆Z = 1) nuclides can be
resolved by their revolution times because the difference of
their m/q ratios is sufﬁciently large, thanks to the odd-even

be resolved by charge then, in principle, all nuclides can be
identiﬁed and measured in IMS experiments.

In this work, we describe a new method, in which detailed
characteristics of the timing detector are considered in the
data analysis. The charge resolution of IMS is improved sig-
niﬁcantly, leading to a complete separation of 34Ar and 51Co.
Possible future developments are discussed as well.

II. EXPERIMENT AND THE TIMING DETECTOR

The following discussions are based on the same experi-
mental data that were analyzed in the earlier work [33]. More
details about the experiment can be found in Refs. [33–35].
This experiment aimed to measure the masses of Tz = −3/2

nuclei in the pf -shell. The nuclei of interest were produced
by using projectile fragmentation of 463 MeV/u 58Ni19+ pri-
mary beams in a ∼ 15 mm 9Be production target. At this
energy the fragments emerged from the target predominantly
as bare ions. Therefore, in the following we assume the
atomic charge q to be equal to atomic number Z. The RI-
BLL2 and CSRe were set to a ﬁxed magnetic rigidity of
Bρ = 5.677 Tm. All fragments within the Bρ-acceptance
of ∼ ±0.2% were injected into the CSRe.

The revolution times of the stored ions were measured
by using a timing detector equipped with a carbon foil of
19 µg/cm2 in thickness and 40 mm in diameter [11]. The
foil was positioned in the circulation path of the stored
ions. When an ion passed through the carbon foil, secondary
electrons were released from the foil surface and guided
isochronously to a set of micro-channel plates (MCP) in the
Chevron conﬁguration [36]. The MCP had the same diame-
ter as the carbon foil and the micro-channels were 5 µm in

diameter. When an electron hits a channel of the MCP, an
avalanche of further secondary electrons propagated through
the channel. The bunch of electrons exiting from the rear side
of that channel was collected by a conical anode. A signal can
be generated with the activation of one or more channels. The
negative-voltage signal was directly transmitted from the an-
ode to a digital oscilloscope for data acquisition. The record-
ing time was 200 µs for each injection in this experiment.

The amount of electrons from the carbon foil induced by an
ion is roughly proportional to the energy loss, which scales
with q2 = Z 2 [11]. Consequently, both the average signal
amplitude (A0) and the detection efﬁciency (η) for an ion de-
pend strongly on its atomic number Z.

Figure 1 (a) shows the two-dimensional plot of revolution
times T and A0 obtained in the experiment, similar as Fig. 3
given in the earlier work [33]. The 51Co27+ and 34Ar18+ ions
can be resolved by using the A0 value, albeit not completely
separated. Figure 1 (a) is an analogue of the typical PID plots
at an in-ﬂight separator [16, 17], though with a lower charge
resolution but a higher m/q resolution. Figure 1 (b) shows the
two-dimensional plot of T versus η. The two plots in Fig. 1
are quite similar. It seems that A0 provides a better charge
resolution for heavier ions while η does better for lighter ones.

III. ANALYSIS OF THE SIGNAL AMPLITUDES

In the earlier work, the average signal amplitude (A0) was
used to resolve the 51Co27+ and 34Ar18+ ions [33]. Figure 2
(a) shows the scatter plot of revolution times T versus A0
and its projected histogram for 34Ar and 51Co. Although two
ion species can be well resolved, there still exists an overlap
between the two Gaussian-like distributions.

Assuming each micro-channel is fully discharged after the

electron impact and thus provides the same contribution to
the signal, A0 is roughly proportional to the average num-
ber of the activated micro-channels and in turn to the number
of released secondary electrons from the foil surface. How-
ever, there were ion passages through the detector which did
not generate signals. This reﬂects the ﬁnite detection efﬁ-
ciency η [33], which includes electron hits in between the
channels (geometrical efﬁciency) and the hits into the already
discharged channels (dynamic efﬁciency). We deﬁne an aver-
age signal amplitude corrected by the total efﬁciency as A1

A1 = A0 × η.

(1)

It is clear that A1 is proportional to the total number of micro-
channels activated by an ion. Figure 2(b) shows the scatter
plot of revolution times T versus A1 and the projected his-
togram for 34Ar and 51Co. It can directly be seen that the
separation of these two ions became better.

the
After a micro-channel was activated to output
avalanche electrons, it took ∼ 10 ms to recharge the channel.
During this period, the channel did not respond to other com-
ing electrons. Since the measurement time is much shorter
than the recharging time, each micro-channel could be used
at most once during the measurement [37].
If the number
of stored ions was too large in one injection into the CSRe,
the total number of activated micro-channels would be large
and the chance for each electron to activate a micro-channel
would be reduced, leading to the reduced A0 and η values.
This dynamic efﬁciency obviously depends on the number of
stored ions and their charge. The sum amplitude of all signals
(As) was a direct measure of the total number of activated
channels in one injection. It is thus expected that A1 values
have a negative correlation with As values for one ion species.
In the present experiment, the number of stored ions ranged

By using A2 for particle identiﬁcation, the mass excess of
51Co is re-determined to be −27332(41) keV, in agreement
with the value −27342(48) keV obtained previously [33].
The smaller mass uncertainty in this analysis is mainly due
to larger statistics obtained to less strict constraints. In the
earlier work only the particles that were stored for more than
300 revolutions in the CSRe were used in the analysis. Based
on the since then improved data analysis methods, the thresh-
old could be lowered in the present work to 80 revolutions,
thus increasing the statistics.

from 2 to 46 in various injections with the most probable
value of 21. The As values ranged from 50 to 300 V. The
relationship between A1 and As values is similar for all ion
species, and is demonstrated in Fig. 3 on the example of 36K
and 53Ni ions, which can be clearly identiﬁed by using their
revolution times. The mean ¯A1 values are calculated for these
two ion species. The A1/ ¯A1 ratios are calculated for each in-
dividual ion and the scatter plot of A1/ ¯A1 versus As is shown
in Fig. 3. The A1/ ¯A1 values for both ion species are de-
scribed by a linear function of As. The obtained two slopes
are very similar indicating a constant slope for all ion species.
If the observed correlation of A1 and As values is taken into
account, the charge resolution can be improved.

A new parameter A2 is deﬁned as an estimate of the A1
value at As = 0 V. The A2 value is proportional to the num-
ber of channels that should be activated by the ion if all micro-
channels are available. It is thus directly related to the num-
ber of released electrons from the detector foil due to this
ion. Considering the constant slope for different ion species
as shown in Fig. 3, the A2 value can be calculated as

A2 = A1 × (1 − B × As).

(2)

The B parameter represents the slope in Fig. 3 and is deter-
mined by using all ion species with proton number Z > 8
and more than 100 counts. It is equal to B = −9.05(7) ×
10−4 V−1. Figure 2(c) shows the scatter plot of revolution
times T versus A2 and the projected histogram for 34Ar and
51Co ions. It can be seen that the two ions are completely
separated.

Since the revolution time T is Bρ dependent for ions of
34Ar and 51Co [3, 4], the T values should depend on the ions’
average passage position through the detector. As show in
Fig. 2, there is no correlation of A0, A1 and A2 values with
the revolution time T , proving position independence of A0,
A1 and A2 in this experiment.

The A0, A1 and A2 values are calculated for all ions. Fig-
ure 4 (a) shows the average values of these three parameters
for ions with the same proton number Z. As can be seen, the
A1 and A2 values are very similar, while A0 is larger than the
other two parameters for light ions. A2 increases rapidly with

more sensitive to proton number Z. The standard deviations
of these three parameters are shown in Fig. 4(b) as a function
of Z. For heavy ions (Z ∼ 20) they are similar for all three
parameters, while for lighter ions the standard deviation of
A0 is considerably larger.

The charge resolution ratio R is introduced to represent the

separation of two ion species. R is deﬁned as

R(A; Z, ∆Z ) =

AZ − AZ−∆Z
σAZ + σAZ−∆Z

,

(3)

where A indicates the parameters used in the charge identiﬁ-
cation, Z is the proton number and ∆Z is the proton number
difference of two ion species. For the normal distribution,
two peaks can be resolved if R ≥ 2, corresponding to less
than 2.5% of events from one peak to overlap with another
peak. In the case of R = 1, two peaks can be identiﬁed with
∼ 16% overlapping events.

eral technical improvements. The charge resolution can be
improved by extending the recording time for each injection,
namely from the present 200 µs to 400-600 µs. A lower num-
ber of stored ions in an individual injection will also lead to a
higher resolution. Two timing detectors, a new IMS method
which is under development and will be applied in future ex-
periments at CSRe [12, 38–41], could also increase the charge
resolution. Last but not least, the MCP plates with 2 µm
pore size will be adopted thus boosting the number of micro-
channels.

(black solid block), A1 (red solid dot) and A2 (blue hollow block)
as a function of proton number Z.

Figure 5 shows the charge resolution ratios for different
pairs of ions with ∆Z = 2. The charge resolution ratios
for A2 (R(A2)) are the largest for all ions, with an increase
by 10% − 650% as comparing with those for A0. The A2
parameter provides the highest charge resolution. Using A2
values in the calculation, Figure 6 shows R(A2) for pairs of
ions with various ∆Z as a function of Z. The R values are
directly related to ∆Z/Z. In this experiment, pairs of ions
with ∆Z/Z > 0.22 can clearly be resolved.

Only a moderate charge resolution was achieved in this ex-
periment since the charge resolution was not specially opti-
mized. A better charge resolution can be realized with sev-

In the IMS experiments, charge resolution provides crucial
information for particle identiﬁcation of ion pairs with m/q
ratios too similar to be resolved by their revolution times. In
an earlier work, the charge-resolved IMS was developed at
the CSRe to resolve the 51Co27+ and 34Ar18+ ions. How-
ever, the two ion types were not separated completely due to
the limited charge resolution.
In this work a new analysis
method is presented, which explicitly considers in the data
analysis the average signal amplitudes, the detection efﬁcien-
cies, and the number of stored ions. The charge resolution of
IMS is signiﬁcantly improved for ions with Z < 22, leading
to a complete separation of 34Ar and 51Co. The mass excess
of 51Co is re-determined to be −27332(41) keV, in agree-
ment with the previous value [33]. The developed analysis
method may be of a broader interest for storage-ring-based
atomic and nuclear physics experiments using similar type of
detectors.
