Ion resonance instability of toroidal electron plasmas in a tight aspect ratio axisymmetric toroidal device
is reported for Ar+ ions of diﬀerent initial density values using a high ﬁdelity 3D3V PIC solver. Stability
of a recently discovered quiescent quasi-steady state (QQS) of a toroidal electron plasma obtained from
“seed” solution as a result of entropy extremization at zero inertia, is addressed to the presence of a small
ion population. An ion fraction (f ) and corresponding number of secondary electrons are preloaded into
the system after the electron plasma attains a QQS state. Driven by the ions, the electron plasma exhibits
destabilized “center of charge motion” (m = 1) along with increased poloidal mode coupling (m = 1 to 9) with
dominant m = 2 mode. The growth in wall probe current is algebraic in nature and increases for f ≥ 0.005,
showing saturation at later time. Higher values of ion temperatures than the electron temperatures indicate
a resonant energy transfer from electron plasma to ions via ion-resonance and concomitant ion heating. The
volume averaged temperature value of the electron plasma rises with simulation time, attaining a quasi-steady
nature near the end of the simulation time. As can be expected from conservation of adiabatic invariants,
the ﬂux tube averaged electron temperatures along parallel and perpendicular directions are found to scale as
1/R2 and 1/R respectively, where R is the major radial variable, though the plasma is nearly collision-less.

INTRODUCTION

Instability induced conﬁnement issues in charged
particle traps are ubiquitous and eﬀective mitigation
of such issues requires knowledge of the underlying
fundamental processes, which in turn often result in
further technical improvement of the device. Besides
providing useful insight into several fundamental physical
processes, these particle trapping devices become very
useful in various applications, as discussed next.

External electric ﬁeld and homogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld aided linear traps such as Penning-Malmberg1
(PM) trap, Paul trap2 and some modiﬁed PM traps3–5
are used extensively to trap pure electron plasma6,
pure ion plasma7,8 and unconventional charge species
such as positron plasma9, anti-protron plasma.10,11
radial and axial
In straight cylindrical PM trap,
conﬁnement are provided to the pure electron (or
ion) plasma, with the aid of an axial homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld and electrostatic end plugs, respectively.
The result achieved in such an arrangement is so
robust that the electron plasma plasma can be conﬁned
for a long time (over several days) in near absolute
equilibrium state12–15, allowing numerous experiments
to be performed. For example, pure electron plasmas
share fundamental properties with inviscid 2D Euler
ﬂuids at low density limit (m → 0) and hence are often
investigated experimentally16 to understand complex

of pure electron plasmas are found in high-precision
measurement techniques22,23, mass spectrometry24,25
etc. Positron, antiprotons are conﬁned in separate PM
traps with modiﬁed electric ﬁelds and axial magnetic
ﬁeld, to synthesize antihydrogen used in anti-matter
investigations10,11,26. Linear Paul traps2,8 are mainly
motivated to trap low density ions using time varying
RF ﬁelds and axial magnetic ﬁelds, whereas stabilization
of the ions is performed with laser cooling27.
Such
stable ions are used in quantum information processing28,
mass spectrometry29 etc. Stable pair plasmas such as
positron-electron, found in astrophysical environment,
are studied experimentally using combined Penning-Paul
trap30,
inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld in magnetic
mirror conﬁguration31 and recently reported numerical
experiment32 with RF multipole electric ﬁeld. In a recent
experiment, stable electron-ion coexistence is achieved in
a PM like33 trap under certain conditions.

In contrast to the above discussed devices, toroidal
traps34–40 of diﬀerent aspect ratios (a/b, a is the major
radius, b is the minor radius) apply an inhomogeneous
external magnetic ﬁeld with inherent curvature to conﬁne
an electron plasma. The electron plasma goes through
rotational cross-ﬁeld E × B drift where E ﬁeld is the
self electric ﬁeld of the plasma and B is the external
toroidal ﬁeld. Because of the strong rotational E × B
drift, electron plasma avoids the vertical loss of particles

plasma undergoes toroidal m = 1 Diocotron41 rotation
or center of charge dynamics, which is similar to the
Diocotron motion of cylindrical electron plasma but
due to magnetic ﬁeld curvature are strongly coupled to
elliptical (i.e. m = 2) mode and often to other higher
order poloidal modes (i.e. m = 3, 4, 5 etc)66 depending
on the aspect ratio of the device and the amplitude of
the m = 1 mode. Apart from toroidal magnetic ﬁeld,
electron plasma is also conﬁned using magnetic surfaces
in stellarator62 and dipole magnetic ﬁeld43 based devices.
Earliest experiments of trapped electron plasmas in
toroidal geometry were performed by Janes et al. (a/b
∼ 5)34, Daugherty et al.
(a/b ∼ 4.6)35, where the
axisymmetric toroidal device was proposed to be used as
heavy ion plasma accelerator (HIPAC) producing highly
stripped heavy ions. The device was intended to utilize
the potential well of the electron plasma to trap and
accelerate heavy ions.
Subsequent experiments were
performed to conﬁne electron plasma in axisymmetric
toroidal geometry of diﬀerent aspect ratios (a/b ∼ 6.236
and ∼ 1.537,38), followed by a number of experiments
in partial toroidal geometry: small aspect ratio device
SMARTEX-C (a/b ∼ 1.6)39, large aspect ratio device
LNT II (a/b ∼ 13.7)40.

As indicated before, near-absolute equilibria of the
electron plasma in PM traps with uniform magnetic
ﬁelds allows various experiments to be performed in
the device. Such near-absolute equilibrium in toroidal
trap was recently addressed and a quiescent quasi-steady
(QQS)45,46 toroidal electron plasma has been found in
a numerical experiment with similar parametric space
of that of an existing small aspect ratio torus39. This
ﬁnding also suggests the possibility of realizing such
a quiescent pure ion plasma in toroidal equilibrium,
which might provide excellent testbed/new directions for
quantum information processing8,28 in future.

ion resonance instability
of the cylindrical electron plasma in the presence of
axially drifting ions or “transient” ions (due to rapid
loss of ions in the axial direction as compared to an
inﬁnitely long cylinder) was investigated analytically by
Fajans55. This theory suggested algebraic growth of
the Diocotron instability, which was also reported to
be conﬁrmed in the experiment performed by Peurrung
et al.56 under similar experimental conditions. Earlier,
simulation based studies using 2D Particle-in-Cell(PIC)
code PEC2PIC63–65, have been performed addressing
the ion resonance instability of cylindrically conﬁned
partially neutralized electron plasma, under diﬀerent
initial conditions. Through collisional and collisionless
processes, the growth rate of diﬀerent Diocotron modes
were addressed where the results were found to be in
good agreement with the Davidson and Uhm model. It
was also shown that the non-ionizing collisions do not
initiate instabilities in contrary to then existing theory64.

Extensive investigation of the dependency of the growth

that the improved vacuum condition of the device
resulted in the damping of the growth of the instability.

In the present study, we have addressed the eﬀect of
ion resonance instability on the toroidal electron plasma
in QQS state, via preloaded Ar+ ion plasma for diﬀerent
fractional neutralization41 values f = ni/ne i.e. the ratio
of ion density to electron density, in an axisymmetric
tight aspect ratio device using PEC3PIC45,46,66,67. It is
shown that the electron plasma is destabilized and the
wall probe current shows algebraic growth. It is found
that the growth rate increases with increasing values
of f . Along with “center of charge motion” (m = 1)
of the electron plasma, mode coupling between toroidal
Diocotron modes (m = 1 to 9) has been observed with
m = 2 as the dominant mode. The growth of the wall
probe current later saturates as ion (and electron) losses
increase with simulation time.
It is shown that the
calculated value of ion plasma rotational frequency of the
Ar+ ion plasma in cylindrical approximation is at ∼ 31%
deviation from the toroidal m = 1 Diocotron41 frequency
of the electron plasma. Destabilization of the electron
plasma and algebraic growth of the wall probe current is
brought out unambiguously. It has been observed that
the ion resonance instability of the electron plasma is
possible for a certain range of the ion plasma rotational
frequency (via adding N + and H + ions into the system
and observing the electron plasma dynamics, though the

3

results are not shown here). Collision-less heating of the
ions has been observed resulting in high ion temperature
values, which is interpreted as due to a resonant transfer
of energy of the electron plasma to ions via toroidal
ion-resonance instability.

In Sec.

II, the toroidal device conﬁguration is given
and the initial conditions including the initialization
steps of electron/ion plasma loading in the toroidal device
are explained. Sec. III various diagnostics implemented
for this study are shown. In Sec. IV the conclusion of
the present study is described.

PARAMETERS

As discussed previously, 3D3V particle-in-cell21 code
PEC3PIC45,66 has been used in the present study,
addressing the dynamics of toroidal electron plasma in
tight aspect ratio axisymmetric toroidal device (in a
similar parametric space as SMARTEX-C39). Correct
loading of the electron and ion plasma in this device
is crucial for the desired experiments and needs careful
study along with corresponding simulation parameters
used in the study. In the next Subsec. II A, the device
parameters and initialization process of the plasmas are
explained in details.

A. Device parameters and initialization of the electron
and ion plasma

cylindrical geometry.
Inner wall radius of the torus is
R1 = 0.05 m and the outer wall radius is R2 = 0.22 m,
making the device aspect ratio ∼ 1.6. Height of the
torus is Lz = 0.32 m. The vessel is closed by upper and
lower boundary walls. The boundary walls of the torus
are conducting. Wall probes are located near the inner
boundary wall, separated by θ = π/2 locations at Lz =
0.16 m mid-plane are shown. The device size is identical
to that of SMARTEX-C39.

At background pressure of 10−9 to 10−7 torr57,62, ions
and secondary electrons are generated by the energetic
primary electrons due to ionization of the background
neutral atoms.
In typical tight aspect ratio toroidal
experiments57 with pressure 10−8 torr, the ion build up is
upto ∼ 2.5% within 5×10−4 sec time span. To investigate
the eﬀects of low density ion population on the primary
electron plasma in our study, the primary electron
plasma, Ar+ ion plasma along with secondary electron
plasma are loaded in the system in two consecutive steps,
described next in detail.

As described in Ref.4545, in the ﬁrst step, zero-inertia
maximum entropy density distribution function45 is used
as the “seed” particle density proﬁle of the primary
electron plasma in the system at the beginning of the

4

simulation which has been previously shown to result
in a novel quiescent quasi-steady state (QQS)45 of
the electron plasma. Thus the initial spatial density
distribution of the electron plasma, following this initial
“seed” solution, is shown to evolve into an axisymmetric

inner wall boundary is R1 = 0.05 m, outer wall is R2 = 0.22 m
(aspect ratio ∼ 1.6) and the height is Lz = 0.32 m. The vessel
is closed by upper and lower boundary walls. Wall probes
located near the inner boundary wall, separated by θ = π/2
from each other are shown at Lz = 0.16 m mid-plane. The
device sizes described are identical to SMARTEX-C39 device.
However unlike the experimental device, here electrostatic
endplugs in the toroidal direction are absent, though the
particle dynamics is fully 3D3V.

FIG. 2. Initial density distribution of the primary electrons
in the 3D toroidal vessel is shown at τ = 0.00, where τ = t/tD
and tD is toroidal Diocotron period66 (∼ 1.8×10−6s) for QQS
state45,46. Only 3/4th of the toroidal direction is shown to
present the poloidal density contours along with the toroidal
density contours. The initial density of the electron plasma
has the radial variation of two orders of magnitude, viz ∼
7.1 × 1012m−3 − 2.485 × 1014m−3 i.e. fb ∼ 0.002 − 0.07, where
fb ∼ 0.07 corresponds to the mode (the locally maximum
value of the density) of the total density distribution at z =
Lz/2 plane (0.16 m) of the torus. Few electrons are present
outside the contour region making the density negligible in
that area. In the absence of ions, this QQS state is shown to

magnetic ﬁeld gradient length scale. Corresponding
density distribution of the electrons in the 3D toroidal
vessel is shown in the Fig. 2 at τ = 0.00, where τ = t/tD
and tD is toroidal Diocotron period66 ∼ 1.8 × 10−6s for
the QQS45,46 state of the electron plasma. The method
to obtain tD was elaborated in a previous study66. The
quantity toroidal Diocotron period is explained later in
Sec. III.

The electrons are cold loaded with zero velocities. This
method of initial loading is in general diﬀerent than the
conventional electron injection technique used in typical
toroidal pure electron plasma experiments39,40, where a
negatively biased injector grid ﬁlament emit the electrons
in toroidal direction, ﬁlling the toroidal vessel via another
positive biased grid placed “nearby”, followed by axial
conﬁnement of electrons by negative end plugs. This
procedure results in a toroidal or parallel velocity such
that toroidal or parallel bounce time is much smaller than
the typical E × B time scale. The parallel kinetic energy

maximum entropy distribution results in nonuniform
density distribution of the electrons featuring contoured
structures with peaked centers in toroidal and poloidal
planes, as shown in the Fig. 2. Though the electrons
ﬁll up the whole torus, only 3/4th of the whole torus
is shown in this ﬁgure (Fig. 2) to present the poloidal
density contours along with the toroidal density contours.
This conﬁguration of the density distribution will be used
throughout this paper. The initial density of the electron
plasma is in the range ∼ 7.1×1012m−3 −2.485×1014m−3
fb ∼ 0.002 − 0.07. Here fb is the “cylindrical”
i.e.
Brillouin fraction41 ratio, fb = 2ωp
2, (ωp is the
plasma frequency and ωc is the cyclotron frequency for
magnetic ﬁeld B0 (0.03T ) at inner wall radius). (Inferred
range of fb is in the range fb ∼ 10−3 − 10−4 in the
experiments57, which is typically an order of magnitude
lower than our simulation parameters.) As there are
very few electrons in the outer regions of the plasma, the
density contours are seen to sharply fall to zero in this
region. The electron plasma attains QQS state shortly
after the initialization and is left to evolve upto τ = 11.11.
In the second step, the Ar+ ions are introduced in
the system at τ = 11.11 (which corresponds to t =
2×10−5 s) according to same spatial distribution of QQS

i.e. fb ∼ 0.0019 − 0.067. Here fb ∼ 0.067 corresponds to the mode of the total electron density distribution at z = Lz/2
plane of the torus. (b) The density distribution of Ar+ ion plasma at τ = 11.11 for fractional neutralization factor f = 0.007
which corresponds to the ratio of ion density to the electron density i.e. ni/ne. The density of the ion plasma is in the range
∼ 4.78 × 1010m−3 − 1.67 × 1012m−3. Here 1.67 × 1012m−3 corresponds to the mode of the total ion density distribution at z
= Lz/2 plane of the torus.

fractional neutralization factor41 f , which corresponds
to the fraction of ion population to the primary electron
population i.e. ni/ne, is reported as typically ∼ 10−5 to
10−4. For partial toroidal experiments57,62, f ∼ 10−2 to
10−1. In our axisymmetric toroidal simulation, f values
are chosen between 0.001 and 0.01, which is in the range
of experimental estimates. The 3D density distributions
of primary electron plasma and Ar+ ion plasma at τ =
11.11, is shown in the Fig. 3 (a) and (b) respectively
for f = 0.007. In Fig. 3 (a), the density of the electron
plasma is in the range ∼ 6.83×1012m−3 −2.39×1014m−3
i.e. fb ∼ 0.0019 − 0.067. Fig. 3 (b), the density of the ion
plasma is in the range ∼ 4.78×1010m−3−1.67×1012m−3.
The ion densities used are two orders of magnitude
smaller than the electron density at any given spatial
location.

Along with the ions, cold (zero velocity) secondary
electrons are also loaded at τ = 11.11 with density
value f times the density of the primary electrons i.e.
the density of secondary electron plasma is same as the
ion plasma loaded. This method mimics the ionization
process in the experiments and conserves the total
charge of the system at τ = 11.11. Total energy of
the system is not eﬀected by addition of the secondary
electron population/ion population because of the low
density ∼ 10−3 to 10−2. After the loading processes,
this nonneutral plasma consisting of the primary and
secondary electrons along with ions is left to evolve
and the dynamics is monitored through the simulation
time period upto 34 tD. In the next Subsec. II B, the
simulation parameters are described.

More details on the code and the algorithm can be found
in the recent QQS study45 of electron plasmas where
same PIC code has been used. Here initial super particle
number for the primary electron plasma is 2560640 in
a grid size of 192 × 192 × 192 in Cartesian coordinates.
At τ = 11.11, super particle number for the primary
electron plasma becomes 2464401 due to initial loss of
the electrons. Also initial super particle numbers for the
ion plasma and secondary electron plasma are 2464401
each at τ = 11.11. The density values of the ion plasma
and secondary electron plasma are made f times lesser
than the primary electron plasma using the fractional
neutralization factor f = 0.007 in the code. At τ =
11.11, most of the electron and ion particles are conﬁned
in toroidal tube with high density value which has lesser
volume than the whole torus, as shown in the Fig. 3.
Thus the eﬀective number of particles (electrons and
ions) per 3D cell of this toroidal tube is ∼ 10 and the
number of particles per 3D cell of the whole toroidal
simulation device is ∼ 3.4. Numerical conservation tests
for the current PEC3PIC solver has been performed in a
previous study66. Ar+ ion used in the study have mass
72820.77 me where me is the electron mass.

The toroidal magnetic ﬁeld used in this device is
spatially inhomogeneous. At inner wall radius R1, the
magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld is highest (B0 = 0.03T )
and gradually falls with cylindrical radial coordinate R
as B = B0R1/R. At R = R1 the estimated electron
cyclotron time period Tce = 1.19 × 10−9s and the ion
cyclotron time period Tci = 8.68 × 10−5s. As is obvious,

the cyclotron periods are smallest at the largest magnetic
ﬁeld in the system, which is at the inner wall at R = R1.

10 times smaller than the smallest cyclotron time in the
system.

this work, a constant capacitance value is chosen to be
C = 0.08pF so that the obtained order of magnitude of
probe current is similar to typical experimental values18.

III. DIAGNOSTICS

As indicated earlier, to investigate the electron and
ion plasma dynamics, we have implemented several
diagnostics suitable for this study. The diagnostics
results covers the simulation time period τ = 0.00 to τ
= 34.

simulation time periods τ = 16.67, 21.11, 23.33 and 25.56, where τ = t/tD and tD is toroidal Diocotron period for QQS
state. The density contours of electron plasma along with the spatial position of the plasma is shown in (a)-(d). These ﬁgures
show displaced electron plasma with “center of charge motion” (m = 1 mode) in the vertical and horizontal direction, with

starts to gain energy from the system and initial shape of the plasma (Fig. 3 (b) and (d)) at τ = 11.11) is distorted.
(f)-(h), at τ = 21.11, 23.33, 25.56 respectively, the ion plasma spreads out into the torus representing rapid loss form the torus
boundaries. This loss of ions is also reﬂected in decrement of the peak poloidal and toroidal density values of the ion plasma
through the simulation time.

A. Growth in wall probe current and dependency on f

To study the electron dynamics in the presence of ions
in the system, wall probe signal (wall probe voltage in
Volts) is obtained as a function of time from one of
the inner wall probe and the corresponding wall probe
current is shown in Fig. 4. Wall probe current from
three other probes at three remaining toroidal locations
provide identical information which suggests absence of
any toroidal mode in the system (not shown here).
In
Fig.
4, wall probe current growth is observed for f
values ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 upto τ = 34. As
discussed earlier, at τ = 0.00, a cold electron plasma
density distribution obtained by extremizing inertia-less
entropy is initialized45,66, which evolves self consistently

into a quiescent quasi-steady (QQS) state, as reﬂected in
the wall probe data shown in Fig. 4. As discussed earlier,
ions are then introduced “by hand” or “pre-loaded” at τ
= 11.11 (along with equal number of secondary electrons,
as it would happen in an ionizing process), soon after
which, the amplitudes of the probe currents start to grow
with time and the growth is more for higher values of f
for any instant of time. This is clearly demonstrated in
the inset plot displayed at the onset of the growth. Also
an initial phase diﬀerence between the probe currents for
diﬀerent values of f can be observed. The growth of the
wall probe current is algebraic in nature for all values of
f and saturates at later time of the simulation, mainly
for higher f values. More analysis on the growth rate is
performed in Subsec. III E.

8

FIG. 6. (a)-(d) shows electrostatic potential surface plots of the system for f = 0.007 at diﬀerent simulation time periods τ =
16.67, 21.11, 23.33 and 25.56, where τ = t/tD and tD is toroidal Diocotron period for QQS state. The potential surface plots
display closed axisymmetric toroidal potential well of the system, with spatial location of the well minima around the same
spatial location of the electron plasma density maxima (Fig. 5 (a)-(d)).

To aid the above analysis, spatial positions of the
electron plasma inside the torus along with density
contours are shown in Fig. 5 (a)-(d), at simulation times
τ = 16.67, 21.11, 23.33, 25.56 respectively with f =
0.007 case. Before τ = 11.11, the electron plasma has
attained a quiescent state with negligible displacement,
shown in previous study of QQS state45,46. After ions
were introduced at τ = 11.11, the “center of charge
motion” (m = 1) of the electron plasma in the poloidal
plane gains amplitude as time progresses. The electron
plasma is displaced along the vertical and horizontal
directions, with a distinguishable compression-expansion
cycle due to toroidicity. The peak density values at
the toroidal/poloidal plane evolve periodically along with

ﬁgures, the poloidal shape of the plasma shows elliptic
nature representing m = 2 mode. Referring to Fig. 4,
the probe currents attain “double peak” nature which
actually corresponds to the “center of charge motion”
(m = 1) of the electron plasma in the poloidal plane
and onset of strong compression-expansion cycle. Due
to this center of charge motion, electron plasma makes
a ﬁnite amplitude elliptical trajectory in the poloidal
plane, which we dub here as nonlinear toroidal Diocotron
motion and eﬀectively similar to the cylindrical m =
1 Diocotron motion of the electron plasma with a
remarkable diﬀerence that at such small aspect ratios
as studies here, the modes are coupled in a poloidal
plane due to strong toroidicity or 1/R dependence of
the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld. Among these double peaks,
the higher amplitude peak corresponds to the electron
plasma position near the inner wall of the torus with most
compressed form of the plasma and the lower amplitude
peak appears while the plasma is away from the inner
wall in most expanded form66. This can be seen from

the Fig. 4, (i) the growth rate of the amplitudes of the
peaks increases with time for every f values (for higher f
values growth with time is more) and (ii) at any instant
of time, the amplitude values of the peaks depend on
f values i.e. with high value of f the peak amplitude
is higher. This brings out clearly the fact that with
higher ion density the “center of charge” motion becomes
stronger, which means an extended elliptical trajectory of
the electron plasma from the QQS state, in the poloidal
plane of the torus. This displacement of the electron
plasma increases rapidly with time for higher values of
the ion density. These signatures point out clearly that
the physics of destabilization of QQS state is strongly
connected to the presence of ions and its amplitude to the
initial fraction of ions f present in the system. Following
the above said arguments, we believe that the wall probe
growth or amplitude increase is indeed due to a toroidal
ion resonance instability.

The time evolution of the ion plasma and density is
shown in Fig. 5. At τ = 16.67 (see Fig. 5 (e)) the
initially cold loaded ion plasma starts to gain energy from
the system and initial shape of the plasma (Fig. 3 (b) at
τ = 11.11) is distorted. In Fig. (f)-(h), at τ = 21.11,
23.33, 25.56 respectively, the plasma spreads out into
the torus representing rapid loss of ions from the torus
boundaries. Initial loss of the ions is higher at the top
boundary wall and at later simulation times from other
boundary walls also. This loss of ions is also reﬂected
in decrement of the peak poloidal and toroidal density
values of the ion plasma through the simulation time.
Also rapid ion loss is discussed in the next Subsec. III C.
The cold loaded ion plasma gains enough kinetic energy
from the electron plasma as a result of the ion resonance
instability. As our simulation is collisionless, we believe
that the underlying exchange of energy between ions and

tD is toroidal Diocotron period for QQS state. White dotted line represents the introduction time of the ion plasma at τ =
11.11. Left y axis presents the frequency of the data where as in the right y axis the frequency is normalized by the nonlinear
toroidal Diocotron frequency (∼ 0.58 MHz) of the QQS state. For all values of f , without the ion plasma before τ = 11.11, m
= 1 and m = 2 Diocotron modes are present in the system. For f = 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01 cases higher modes (upto m = 9 for
f = 0.01) start to appear with time and m = 2 mode becomes dominant. The temporal evolution of the spectrogram plots for
f = 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01 cases reveal the ion density dependency of the dominant modes (m = 1 and m = 2) and dynamical
chirping infused coupling of low poloidal modes (m = 1 to m = 9). For f = 0.01 case, a high chirping region between τ ∼ 15
and 16 is noted.

electrons is a collisionless resonant process. The thermal
energy gain of the ions results in increase of ion Larmour
radii (for example, at perpendicular ion temperature
∼ 0.214 m
50 eV , average Larmour radius of an ion is ρ

Li

near the inner wall location and ρ

∼ 1.073 m near

outer wall location). Also various inertia driven drifts
due to the toroidal inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds (∇B
and curvature drift) aid the loss of ions. Thus the ions
are rapidly lost from the system. The energy transfer
process is investigated further in the Subsec. III D.

Corresponding to the presented spatial locations and
density plots of the electron and ion plasma, electrostatic
potential surface plots of the system are shown in Fig.
6 (a)-(d). The potential surface plots display closed
axisymmetric toroidal potential well of the system, with
spatial
location of the well minima around the same
spatial location of the electron plasma density maxima
(Fig. 5 (a)-(d)). This potential well has parabolic nature
in the poloidal plane and the ions are initially trapped in
the potential well. Though the location of the maxima
of the ion plasma density is near to that of the electron
plasma/potential minima at τ = 16.67, after that the ion
plasma density maxima do not exhibit the same. This
observation suggests the decoupling of the ion plasma
from the electron plasma at later simulation time period
after τ = 16.67. More analysis on this is presented in

Subsec. III D.

To further understand the dynamics of the dynamic
toroidal Diocotron modes of the system and possible
mode coupling associated with the electron and ion
plasma dynamics, spectrogram analysis of the wall probe
current has been performed for f = 0.0 (QQS state),
0.001, 0.005, 0.01 upto τ = 34 and shown in Fig. 7.
Spectrogram frequency is normalized by the nonlinear
toroidal Diocotron frequency (∼ 0.58 MHz) of the QQS
state and shown in the right y axis. For all values of f
considered, without the ion plasma before τ = 11.11, m
= 1 and m = 2 Diocotron modes are the only dominant
ones that are present in the system. For f = 0.001, 0.005
and 0.01 cases higher modes (upto m = 9 for f = 0.01)
start to appear with time with introduction of ions at τ =
11.11 and m = 2 mode becomes dominant. The temporal
evolution of the spectrogram plots for f = 0.001, 0.005
and 0.01 cases reveal the ion density dependency of the
dominant modes (m = 1 and m = 2) and dynamical
chirping infused coupling of low poloidal modes (m = 1 to
m = 9). Similar feature of the poloidal modes with m = 2
as dominant mode, was also seen in our previous study66
with an initial loading of the electron plasma while the
electron plasma had stronger “center of charge” motion
than that of the QQS state. Also for f = 0.01 case, a
high chirping region at very low power has been observed
between τ ∼ 15 and 16.

where ωci and ωce are the cyclotron frequency of

is the electron plasma frequency, mi and me are
the ion mass and electron mass respectively.
The
condition for ion resonance instability41 of the electron
plasma in cylindrical geometry is that the ion plasma
rotational
frequency should be nearly equal to the
cylindrical m = 1 Diocotron frequency of the electron
plasma.
In the present study with radially varying
toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, the an approximated ion plasma
rotational frequency has been considered to compare with
the toroidal m = 1 Diocotron rotation of the electron
plasma, as discussed in several ion resonance instability
studies57,62. With the present parameters for Ar+ ions,
the ion plasma rotational frequency (magnetic ﬁeld at
the minor axis location of the torus B = 0.011T ) ∼ 0.4
MHz under cylindrical approximation where “measured”
toroidal Diocotron frequency of the electron plasma ∼
0.58 MHz in our system. To the lowest order in inverse
aspect ratio, thus the ion rotational frequency is at
∼ 31% deviation from toroidal Diocotron frequency
of the electron plasma. As the electron plasma and
ion plasma dynamics are in toroidal geometry with
inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, the presented deviation
should be acceptable,
if a permissible range of the
deviation can be obtained. To estimate the permissible
range of the deviation, N + (mi = 25532.65me) and
H + (mi = 1836me) ions are also introduced in the
device replacing Ar+ ions to observe the electron plasma
dynamics. For N + and H + ions, corresponding ion
plasma rotational
frequencies are ∼ 0.67 MHz (∼
9% deviation) and ∼ 2.4 MHz (∼ 182% deviation)
respectively. Algebraic growth of the wall probe current
similar to Ar+ ions has been observed for N + ions
where as for H + ions, no growth is observed (the
results are not shown here). These ﬁndings indicate
the dependency of the ion resonance instability on the
ion mass. Thus we can conclude that the permissible
value of the ion plasma rotational frequencies to initiate
an ion resonance instability of the electron plasma, for
the current simulation parameters, lies between a certain
range. Further analysis in the present study mainly
focused on the Ar+ ions and detailed investigation of the
ion plasma rotational frequency range can be performed
in future with diﬀerent ion species.

To investigate the ion resonance induced instability
in this system in more detail, loss of electron and ion
particles and temporal evolution of the ion/electron

FIG. 8. Ratio of the instantaneous electron particle number
(NE(t)) to the initial value of the electron particle number
(NE0) i.e. NE(t)/NE0 is shown for diﬀerent values of f upto
τ = 34, where τ = t/tD and tD is toroidal Diocotron period
for QQS state. At τ = 11.11 (indicated by black dotted line)
introduction of ions results into a dip in NE(t)/NE0 values
which is more for higher values of f . The inset plot shows the
eﬀective electron loss, around τ = 11.11.

Though electron plasma in a quiescent quasi-steady
state has better stability properties,
inertia eﬀects
i.e. various drifts due to the toroidal inhomogeneous
magnetic ﬁelds: ∇B and curvature drift (and ρLe/L
to all orders45,46) are present in the system leading to
some electron losses (∼ 2%)45 in the system. As ions
are introduced in the system, destabilization of electron
plasma due to toroidal ion resonance instability, initiates
more rapid loss of electron particles from the system.
Such loss results in conﬁnement issues of electron plasma
in the experimental studies. For the present study,
primary electron particle loss is shown in Fig. 8 where
ratio of the instantaneous electron particle number NE(t)
to the initial value of the electron particle number NE0
i.e. NE(t)/NE0 for diﬀerent values of f upto τ = 34
is shown. Here τ = t/tD and tD is toroidal Diocotron
period for QQS state. The time of introduction of ions
is at τ = 11.11, as indicated by black dotted line. Before
τ = 11.11, the electron plasma evolves into QQS state
and the the plasma losses ∼ 3.5% of initial total number
of electrons. At τ = 11.11 introduction of ions results
into a dip in the quantity NE(t)/NE0 and the loss rate
increases with increasing value of f or ion density. At τ
= 34, the quantity NE(t)/NE0 losses ∼ 5% of the initial
value for f = 0.001 case, and ∼ 8% for f = 0.01 case.
The inset plot around τ = 11.11 shows the the eﬀective

plasma remains destabilized throughout that simulation
time period showing saturation of the amplitude of the
wall probe current (Fig. 4). This suggests, the initial
presence of the ion plasma at τ = 11.11 started the
process of electron plasma destabilization which became
independent of the presence of ion plasma in the system
It is also to be noted that, as the
at a later time.
ion loss rate is more than the electron loss rate along
with the simulation time, the dynamic f values become
lower than the initial values. To understand the plasma
dynamics in detail, temporal evolution of the kinetic
and potential energy of the total system as well as for
electron/ion plasma are described.

D. Energy variation with simulation time

In Fig. 10 energy evolution of the system are shown
upto τ = 34. The initial value of the total energy T E0
(3.503 × 10−5 J) of the system at τ = 0.00 is subtracted
from the total energy (T E), kinetic energy (KE) and
potential energy (P E) of the system and shown for the
values of f ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 in Fig. 10 (a),
(b) and (c) respectively. The time of introduction of
ions is at τ = 11.11, as indicated by black dotted line
in all three plots. Fig. 10 (a) shows T E − T E0 ∼ 10−7,
indicating that the total energy of the system is conserved
for all f values (for lowest f = 0.001, the increment is
< 1%). The inset plot in Fig. 10 (a) around τ = 11.11
shows that total energy (T E − T E0) of the system starts
to decrease before one toroidal Diocotron time period
after τ = 11.11. The inset plots in Fig. 10 (b) and
(c) shows the initial values of KE − T E0 and P E −
T E0 respectively. From τ = 0.00 to τ = 11.11, while the
system remains in QQS state without ion plasma, kinetic
energy of the system/the electron plasma increases, along
with an increase oscillation amplitude, at the cost of
electrostatic potential energy of the system (Fig. 10 (c):
τ = 0.00 to τ = 11.11). After the introduction of cold ion
plasma in the system at τ = 11.11, average kinetic energy
of the system (electrons and ions) rises with time while
the oscillation amplitude starts to grow with time for
all values of f . For higher values of f , the growth in the
oscillation amplitude are higher, where as average kinetic
energy of the system reaches to close values for all f at τ
= 34. In the same time interval, average potential energy
of the system decreases for all values of f (Fig. 10 (c)),
along with growth of the oscillation amplitudes similar as
the kinetic energy. However, the average potential energy
values drops with higher f values at τ = 34, mainly
because of its high transfer to the kinetic energy of the
system (electrons and ions) with higher f values. Also
loss of particles from the system with time (Fig. 8 and
9) aids to small order decrement of the potential energy
of the system. Clearly, rise in the oscillation amplitude
of kinetic energy as well as potential energy with higher
values of f needs to be addressed separately. In the ion

values of f upto τ = 34, where τ = t/tD and tD is toroidal
Diocotron period for QQS state. After τ = 11.11 (indicated
by black dotted line), NI (t)/NI (τ = 11.11) show ﬁnite value
(ion particles are introduced in the system at τ = 11.11) and
its value decreases with simulation time. The decrement is
more for higher values of f . The inset plot shows the starting
of ion loss, around τ = 12.5.

τ = t/tD and tD is toroidal Diocotron period for QQS
state. The time of introduction of ions is at τ = 11.11,
as indicated by black dotted line. Upto τ = 11.11,
NI (t)/NI (τ = 11.11) shows zero value as the system
contained no ions at all, whereas after τ = 11.11,
NI (t)/NI (τ = 11.11) has ﬁnite value (ion particles are
introduced in the system at τ = 11.11). At τ = 34, ion
plasma losses ∼ 32% of its initial value for f = 0.001
case and ∼ 80% for f = 0.01 case. The inset plot around
τ = 11.11 shows the introduction period of ions and the
starting point of the loss of ions from the system. After
τ = 11.11, the loss of ion particles starts after ∼ one
toroidal Diocotron cycle (∼ τ = 12.5) and the starting
time varies with diﬀerent values of f .
In the case of
electron loss, the eﬀective electron loss (after τ = 11.11)
starts just before ∼ one toroidal Diocotron cycle ∼ τ
= 12.5). This observation indicates that though the
loss of ion at later stage of the simulation is rapid and
signiﬁcantly high when compared to the electron loss

ion particles were trapped and gained energy while the
system endured electron particle loss. Also, in spite of
the ion loss at later stage of the simulation, the electrons

electron plasma to ion plasma. Thus the energy proﬁle
variations of the electron and ion plasma are investigated
separately and explained in the next paragraph.

In the above discussion, it is found that the kinetic
energy of the system (i.e.
the electrons and ions)
increases with simulation time. This suggests that
the average temperature also increases.
To verify,

plane. For τ = 20.00 and 34.00, the distribution function
starts to form near-Maxwellian shape which suggests that
the ion plasma approaches equilibrium state. By ﬁtting
the curves we obtain (cid:104)T i
⊥(cid:105)34τ
= 280.36 eV . As seen in this analysis, the ion plasma
forms near-Maxwellian distribution function in the region
between τ = 18.89 to τ = 20.00, indicating that the
ion plasma attains equilibrium after τ = 18.89. The
temperature values (cid:104)T i

plasma indicates anomalous heating of ions via toroidal
ion resonance instability process and to the best of our
knowledge has never been reported prior to this work.

To get a better idea of the energy transfer processes,
kinetic and potential energies of the ion and electron
plasmas have been obtained. Normalized kinetic energy
and potential energy variations of the electron plasma
and ion plasma with simulation time are shown in Fig.
12 upto τ = 34 for f = 0.001 to 0.01. The energy values
are normalized by initial total energy T E0 of the system
at τ = 0.00. The time of introduction of ions is at τ
= 11.11, as indicated by black dotted line in all plots.
Fig. 12 (a) and (b) represents the variation of kinetic
energy KEe/T E0 and potential energy P Ee/T E0 of the
electron plasma respectively, upto the simulation time τ
= 34. The inset plot in Fig. 12 (a) around τ = 11.11
shows that oscillation amplitude in the kinetic energy of
the electron plasma starts to increase at ∼ τ = 11.11.
In Fig. 12 (b), the inset plots around τ = 11.11 shows
∼ 10−3 to 10−2 order increase in the amplitude of the
P Ee/T E0 values at τ = 11.11. This is because of the

addition of secondary electrons of density ∼ 10−3 to
10−2 times the density of the primary electrons. After
τ = 11.11, the kinetic energy and potential energy of
the electron plasma show similar trend as seen in the
total kinetic energy and potential energy variation of the
system (Fig. 10 (b) and (c)) through the simulation time
with the values of f . Following initial drop after τ =
11.11, potential energy of the electron plasma is drained
out as the kinetic energy of the plasma for all values
of f . The drop is more for higher f values as seen in
Fig. 10 (c). Loss of electron particles from the system
with time (Fig. 8) also aids to small order decrement
of the potential energy of the plasma. The orders of
the values of KEe/T E0 are that of the total kinetic
energy of the system throughout the simulation, as the
ions and secondary electrons are loaded cold contributing
zero kinetic energies to the system. Similarly, the orders
of the values of P Ee/T E0 are that of the total potential
energy of the system as the ions and secondary electrons
are loaded with lower density than that of the primary

FIG. 12. Normalized kinetic energy and potential energy variations of the electron plasma and ion plasma are shown upto τ
= 34 for f = 0.001 to 0.01. The energy values are normalized by initial total energy T E0 (3.503 × 10−5 J) of the system at τ
= 0.00. The time of introduction of ions is at τ = 11.11, as indicated by black dotted line in all plots. (a) and (b) represents
the variation of kinetic energy KEe/T E0 and potential energy P Ee/T E0 of the electron plasma respectively. The inset plot
in (a) around τ = 11.11 shows that oscillation amplitude in the kinetic energy of the electron plasma starts to increase at ∼
τ = 11.11. The inset plots in (b), around τ = 11.11 shows ∼ 10−3 to 10−2 order increase in the amplitude of the P Ee/T E0
values at τ = 11.11 because of the addition of secondary electrons. (c) and (d) shows kinetic energy KEi/T E0 and potential
energy P Ei/T E0 of the ion plasma respectively from τ = 11.11 to 34. KEi/T E0 linearly increases after τ = 11.11 for all f
values. The linear ﬁts yield: growth rates α0.001
KE = 0.01052. After the time period τ = 11.11 to τ ∼ 19.17,
the fall of the quantity KEi/T E0 is not followed by rise of the order > 10−3 for any values of f . In the period form τ = 11.11
to τ ∼ 19.17 the ion plasma gains energy from the potential of the electron plasma. In (d), the potential energy of the ion
plasma, increases after τ = 11.11 (at the cost of the potential energy of the electron plasma) with similar ﬂuctuating trend as
the kinetic energy. Around τ ∼ 19.17, the ﬂuctuation reduces and the potential energy of the plasma slowly decreases with
simulation time.

KE = 0.00087 and α0.01

and (b), τ = 19.17 is marked by vertical dotted line in
magenta and explained in next paragraph.

To understand the energy variation of ion plasma
through the simulation time, normalized kinetic energy
KEi/T E0 and potential energy P Ei/T E0 of the ion
plasma are shown in Fig. 12 (c) and (d) respectively for
the values of f ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 from simulation
time τ = 11.11 to τ = 34. As the ion plasma was cold
loaded at τ = 11.11, kinetic energy is zero at τ = 11.11
in Fig. 12 (c). The parameter P Ei/T E0 ∼ 10−3 to
10−2 times the total energy of the system at τ = 11.11
in Fig. 12 (d). Demonstrating typical outcome of the
ion resonance instability process, the ion particles gain
energy (kinetic/potential) from the potential energy of
the electron plasma. As our simulation is collisionless,
we believe that there exists an underlying collisionless
process, resulting in collisionless exchange of energy
between ions and electrons. In Fig. 12 (c), the parameter
KEi/T E0 linearly increases after τ = 11.11 for all f
values. To check the growth rate with respect to f
values, the parameter KEi/T E0 is linearly ﬁtted upto
τ = 11.8 for f = 0.001 and 0.01 cases and shown in the

KE = 0.00087 for f = 0.001 and α0.01

inset plot. The linear ﬁts yield slope of KEi/T E0 growth
as α0.001
KE = 0.01052
for f = 0.01, suggesting ∼ 10 time higher growth rate
for one order of magnitude increase in f value ( α0.01
∼
KE

KE
12.09). After τ = 11.11, the quantity KEi/T E0 displays
ﬂuctuating rise/fall proﬁle with occasional gain/loss of
ion kinetic energy, for all values of f . We have identiﬁed
a region, τ = 11.11 to τ ∼ 19.17 (τ = 19.17 marked by
vertical dotted line in magenta), after when the fall of the
quantity KEi/T E0 is not followed by rise of the order
> 10−3 for any values of f . After τ ∼ 19.17, KEi/T E0
slowly decreases with simulation time with small amount
of ﬂuctuations (though for f = 0.001 to 0.005, the gradual
fall of the kinetic energy starts at later simulation time).
In the period form τ = 11.11 to τ ∼ 19.17, the ion plasma
gains energy from the potential of the electron plasma.
After τ ∼ 19.17 the ion plasma starts to equilibrate. This
transition time is within the region between τ = 18.89 to
τ = 20.00, as seen in the velocity distribution function
analysis of Fig. 11 (d). Further loss of kinetic energy
after τ ∼ 19.17 can also be related to the loss of ion

particles from the system though the particle loss starts
sooner than τ ∼ 19.17 (Fig. 9). The potential energy
of the ion plasma, shown in Fig. 12 (d), also increases
after τ = 11.11 (at the cost of the potential energy of
the electron plasma) with similar ﬂuctuating trend as
the kinetic energy. Around τ ∼ 19.17, the ﬂuctuation
reduces and the potential energy of the plasma slowly
decreases with simulation time, though the transition of
the ﬂuctuation amount around τ ∼ 19.17 is not strikingly
distinguishable as the kinetic energy case. The region
around τ ∼ 19.17 is also identiﬁed in Fig. 12 (a) and (b)
(vertical dotted line in magenta) for the electron plasma,
but there is no noticeable transition of kinetic/potential
energy of the electron plasma around that time period.
The reason might be the low order magnitude of the
ion plasma energies compared to the electron plasma
energies.

E. Growth rate of the wall probe current at diﬀerent
periods of the simulation

1

Fig. 13 (a) shows growth rate analysis of the inner
wall probe current for f = 0.001 and 0.01 upto τ = 34.
Wall probe currents for extrema values of f are chosen
for comparison purpose i.e.
to reveal the dependency
of growth on lower and higher f values. The time of
introduction of ions is at τ = 11.11, as indicated by
black dotted line. τ = 19.17, simulation time close to the
transition time of the ion plasma to equilibrium state, is
indicated by vertical dotted line in magenta. Algebraic
growth rate of the wall probe current is calculated by
linear ﬁtting of the maximum peak among the double
peaks of the probe current, in two regions: (1) τ = 11.11
to 19.17 and (2) τ = 19.17 to 34, for both of f = 0.001 and
0.01. In the initial (τ = 11.11 to 19.17) time period, the
linear ﬁt reveals growth rates γ0.001
= 0.0004 mA/tD and
γ0.01
1 = 0.008 mA/tD. For later time period (τ = 19.17
to 34), growth rates are γ0.001
= 0.0008 mA/tD and γ0.01
= 0.0037 mA/tD. As expected, the growth rate is high
in the initial region and attains lower value in the later
region, indicating saturation of the wall probe current for
f = 0.01 case. This result echos the same explanation of
energy transfer given in the ion plasma energy analysis
of Subsec. III D. For f = 0.001 case though, the growth
rate is higher at later part (lower values than f = 0.01
case). The discrepancy suggests that for lower f values,
the ion plasma gains energy for longer time (low energy
gain than the high f value) and equilibrates at a later
time than τ = 19.17. This feature is also seen in Fig. 12
(a), where for f = 0.001 to 0.005, the fall of the kinetic
energy started at later simulation time (∼ τ = 25). To
get an idea about the variation of the growth rate for
every f values in the present study, growth rate for f =
0.001 to 0.01 are shown as a function of f in Fig. 13 (b),
for the two regions (1) τ = 11.11 to 19.17 and (2) τ =
19.17 to 34 as γ1 and γ2 respectively. Linear ﬁt of γ1 and
γ2 values with respect to f values shows that, γ1 (β1 =

1

1

15

0.821 mA/tD) has higher slope value than γ2 (β1 = 0.263
mA/tD) i.e. the average growth rate of the wall probe
current is higher at the initial time period τ = 11.11 to
19.17. Interestingly, γ1 and γ2 values decreases with low
values of f and approaches to a common value (∼ f =
0.0015).

As discussed in the Sec.

I (Introduction), algebraic
growth55,56,59 is seen in the ion resonance instability with
transient nature of the ion in the cylindrical trap. In tight
aspect ratio toroidal trap experiment57 with toroidal end
plugs, the ions are produced and lost along toroidal
direction and thus are eﬀectively transient. Though
the growth rate is high but slower57 than theoretically
proposed rates by Levy et al.53. Here growth of the
wall probe current has been found out to be algebraic
in nature. In our case there is no continues source of ions
but ion loss occurs throughout the simulation, which is a
unique situation never studied before. But it is evident
that the nature of the instability is similar to that of the
transient ions.

In the next Subsec.

III F, the global temperature
proﬁles of electron and ion plasma are described as
function time. Also the radial temperature proﬁles of
the electron plasma and their evolution is addressed.

electrons were loaded cold, the temperature values start
from zero τ = 0.00 and reaches to ﬁnite temperature
values ((cid:104)T e

Volume averaged parallel and perpendicular distribution
functions, (cid:104)fe(v(cid:107))(cid:105) and (cid:104)fe(v⊥)(cid:105), at τ = 11.11, are shown
in the inset plot. After τ = 11.11, the temperature
values rise further and attains values as (cid:104)T e
(cid:107) (cid:105) ∼ 21 eV
and (cid:104)T e

initially, after τ ∼ 25 the ﬂuctuations in (cid:104)T e
(cid:107) (cid:105) values
were ∼ 5ev and for (cid:104)T e

these global temperature values are in the same range
((cid:39) 10 − 20 eV ) of the values for pure electron plasma, if
the ion plasma was absent from the system, though the
oscillating features at later simulation time represents the

(cid:107) (cid:105) ∼ 21 eV and
(cid:104)T e

was almost steady initially, after τ ∼ 25 the ﬂuctuations

form near-Maxwellian shape around τ = 19.17 (indicated by

⊥(cid:105) ∼ 211 eV at τ =

⊥(cid:105) ∼ 280 eV at τ = 34. As the ions were loaded cold,
the (cid:104)T i
(cid:107)(cid:105) values start from zero at τ = 11.11 and reaches to low
order ﬁnite temperature values ((cid:104)T i
(cid:107)(cid:105) ∼ 0.055 eV ) at τ = 34.
Steep rise in (cid:104)T i
(cid:107)(cid:105) values is seen after τ = 19.17. Volume
averaged parallel and perpendicular distribution functions,
(cid:104)fi(v(cid:107))(cid:105) and (cid:104)fi(v⊥)(cid:105), at τ = 34, are shown in the inset plot.

As seen in Fig.

evolution of the ion plasma also helps to clarify the

(cid:107)(cid:105) and (cid:104)T i

equilibration process of the ion plasma. Thus, the volume
averaged parallel and perpendicular temperatures of the
ion plasma, (cid:104)T i
⊥(cid:105) are shown for case of f =
0.007 upto τ = 34. τ = 19.17 is indicated by vertical
dotted line in magenta. As seen in Fig.
11, the
perpendicular distribution functions of ion plasma form
near-Maxwellian shape around τ = 19.17 with (cid:104)T i
⊥(cid:105) ∼
211 eV at τ = 19.17. After τ = 19.17, (cid:104)T i
⊥(cid:105) values
increases and attains ∼ 280 eV at τ = 34. As the ions
were loaded cold, the (cid:104)T i
(cid:107)(cid:105) values start from zero at τ =
11.11 and reaches to low order ﬁnite temperature values
((cid:104)T i
(cid:107)(cid:105) ∼ 0.055 eV) at τ = 34. However, steep rise in
(cid:104)T i
(cid:107)(cid:105) values is seen after τ = 19.17 suggesting energy
gain of the ion plasma, though very small in the parallel
direction. Volume averaged parallel and perpendicular
distribution functions, (cid:104)fi(v(cid:107))(cid:105) and (cid:104)fi(v⊥)(cid:105), at τ = 34,
are shown in the inset plot.

3. Radial variation of the electron plasma temperature

inversely with R.

The electron plasma performs a center of charge
motion in the poloidal plane, the toroidal electron ﬂux
tubes passes across the 1/R varying toroidal magnetic
ﬁeld resulting in periodic compression–expansion cycle
of
(which is also known as magnetic
pumping). Under this cross-ﬁeld dynamics, mechanisms
like electron-electron large angle collisions, results into
asymmetric exchange of energies between parallel and
perpendicular directions.
the parallel
and perpendicular temperatures of the electron ﬂux
in general,
tubes undergo radial variations which,
scales
simulation is
collisionless, we believe that there exists an underlying
collisionless process, which introduces asymmetry in the
compression–expansion cycle (i.e. MP), resulting in
collisionless exchange of energy between parallel and
perpendicular directions. More details of this mechanism
remain to be explored in future. Extensive analysis
of the radial variation of parallel and perpendicular
temperature of pure toroidal electron plasma had been
performed in our previous work with QQS state.
It
was found out that the parallel temperature of toroidal
electron plasma ﬂux tubes scales as 1/R2 and the
perpendicular temperature scales as 1/R, which is
consistent with the angular momentum conservation and
mean magnetic moment conservation principles.
In
the present study, we have observed similar scaling
laws despite the presence of the ion plasmas in the
system. As performed in the previous study, parallel and
perpendicular temperatures are averaged in two diﬀerent
ways: 1. In toroidal and vertical directions (Z-averaged).
2.
In toroidal direction only, around mid-Z plane
(averaged over toroidal ﬂux tubes). In the ﬁrst method,
particles from diﬀerent vertical coordinates contribute
in the calculations.
In the second method, particles

coordinates, around mid-z plane have been considered.
In the second method,
the particles within a ﬂux
tube at certain R may be expected to follow similar
dynamics to each other.
16 (a)-(d), these
averaged temperatures ¯T e
(cid:107) (R, t) (Fig. 16 (a),(b)) and
¯T e

⊥(R, t) (Fig.
R, at two diﬀerent time periods τ = 16.67 and τ =
25.56 for f = 0.007 case. Z-averaged quantities are
expressed as ¯T e

is performed over diﬀerent sized bins along R and the
respective range of the temperatures are shown by the
error bars in these ﬁgures.

¯T e
(cid:107) (R, t)(Zavg) and ¯T e
(cid:107) (R, t)(F luxtube) values are higher
at the inboard side and gradually fall with R. The
temperature values are ﬁtted with α/R2 and α2/R2 (α
and α2 are an arbitrary constants) showing 1/R2 scaling
with R.
⊥(R, t)(Zavg) and
¯T e
⊥(R, t)(F luxtube) values are also higher at the inboard
side but showing non-monotonic variation with R. The
average temperature values are ﬁtted with β/R and β2/R
(β and β2 are arbitrary constants) showing 1/R scaling
with R. In these plots, the scaling laws are preserved at
later simulation times representing the conservation of
angular momentum and mean magnetic moment, thus
suggesting the conserved quantities of the system are
not aﬀected by the introduction of ion plasma in the
system. The reason for this weak non-monotonicity in
the perpendicular temperature proﬁle is unknown and
also seen in the analysis of pure electron plasma in QQS46
state.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this paper, toroidal electron plasmas in a tight
aspect ratio axisymmetric toroidal device to the presence
of small fraction of ions, has been investigated with a
three dimensional collisionless Particle-in-Cell simulation
study with Ar+ ions as the ion species. The electron
plasma is loaded with a “seed” solution obtained by
zero-inertia entropy maximization and initialized in the
PIC code to evolve to attain a quiescent quasi-steady
state (QQS). After a QQS state is attained, Ar+ ions
and secondary electrons are introduced cold into the
system. Ar+ ions of diﬀerent number density values i.e.
f values (0.001 to 0.01) are used and the dependency of
the instability on the ion density is addressed via diﬀerent
diagnostics methods.

We have demonstrated that the electron plasma
dynamics and the ion plasma dynamics are aﬀected by
presence of small number of ions, for mainly f values >

are also higher at the inboard side but showing non-monotonic variation with R. The average temperature values are ﬁtted

introduced. Thus the results are mainly interpreted on
the basis of high f value datum (f ≥ 0.005). The
growth of the wall probe current is algebraic in nature
and saturates at later simulation time, when a substantial
amount of ions are lost. In our preloaded ion case there
is no continuous source of ions but ions are being lost
with simulation time. This is a unique situation not
belonging to strictly trapped ions or transient ions in
the system. Spatial evolution of the electron plasma
and corresponding spectrogram analysis demonstrate the
destabilized “center of charge motion” (m = 1) of the
electron plasma in poloidal plane along with chirped
coupling between toroidal Diocotron modes (m = 1
to 9 for f = 0.01) with m = 2 as dominant mode.
Investigation of the evolution of the three dimensional
potential well of the system, reveals interesting features.
Based on the above, we have argued that the ion fraction
destabilizes the electron plasma in QQS state via a
toroidal ion resonance instability mechanism.

The variations in the ion and electron plasma energies
show collisionless transfer of electron potential energy to
the kinetic energy of the ion plasma. Though ions start
to exhibit a dynamic nature in the poloidal direction,
toroidal motion of the ions are negligible. This is
understandable as the E(cid:107) = −∇(cid:107)φ ∼ 0, there is no
parallel acceleration or energizing dynamics for ions in

the parallel direction. After initial energy gain, the ion
plasmas start to equilibrate and attains near-Maxwellian
distribution in the poloidal plane. We have identiﬁed a
certain time period after which the ion energy gain is
trivial. Correlating the wall probe growth in the same
time period, it has been found out that the wall probe
current also starts to saturate after that time period.
Also a linear scaling of the growth rate of the instability
with respect to the ion density (f values) has been
obtained for the above mentioned two time windows.
