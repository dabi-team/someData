The strength of the N = 28 magic number in neutron-rich argon isotopes is examined through
high-precision mass measurements of 46−48Ar, performed with the ISOLTRAP mass spectrometer
at ISOLDE/CERN. The new mass values are up to 90 times more precise than previous measure-
ments. While they suggest the persistence of the N = 28 shell closure for argon, we show that this
conclusion has to be nuanced in light of the wealth of spectroscopic data and theoretical investiga-
tions performed with the SDPF-U phenomenological shell model interaction. Our results are also
compared with ab initio calculations using the Valence Space In-Medium Similarity Renormaliza-
tion Group and the Self-Consistent Green’s Function approaches. Both calculations provide a very
good account of mass systematics at and around Z = 18 and, generally, a consistent description of
the physics in this region. This combined analysis indicates that 46Ar is the transition between the
closed-shell 48Ca and collective 44S.

INTRODUCTION

Just as the experimental evidence for “magic” proton
and neutron numbers was instrumental for laying a ba-
sic foundation of nuclear theory [1, 2], the observation
of their demise in exotic nuclear systems [3] was pivotal
for the establishment of the modern understanding of
nuclear structure and the mechanisms driving its evolu-
tion far from β-stability [4–6]. The magic numbers found
their origin in systematic studies of mass diﬀerences [7].
The disappearance of the magic N = 20 shell closure
was likewise evidenced through mass measurements of

exotic sodium (Z = 11) isotopes [3], for which the bind-
ing energy normally reduced beyond a shell closure was
in fact found to increase due to deformation. This was
attributed to intruder conﬁgurations forming what is now
known as the “island of inversion” [8].

The question of the persistence of the next magic num-
ber – N = 28 – below the doubly magic (stable) 48Ca iso-
tope has been subjected to detailed experimental scrutiny
over the past two decades. The demise of the N = 28
spherical gap in the silicon (Z = 14) isotopic chain has
been established through various spectroscopic studies
[9–14] while the sulfur chain (Z = 16) shows signatures
of shape-coexistence in the vicinity of 44S [15–20], a phe-
nomenon often encountered at the border of an island of
inversion [21].

The argon (Z = 18) chain is however less clear cut.
A relatively healthy N = 28 gap is attested by the high
lying E(2+
1 ) excitation energy [16, 22], which is one of
the major indicators of a closed shell. The level scheme
proposed for 45Ar in [9] was also found to be well de-
scribed in a single-particle picture and little collectiv-
ity. Likewise, investigations of neutron-rich argon iso-
topes via neutron knockout reactions [23] portray 46Ar
as a seemingly “good” semi-magic nuclide with a low

ever, later results from (d, p) transfer reactions performed
at GANIL [24, 25] hinted at the erosion of the N = 28
shell gap already at Z = 18. Good indicators of the on-
set of collective nuclear behavior, B(E2: 2+
1 ) values
also give conﬂicting results. Three independent measure-
ments yield a rather low B(E2) value [26–29] compatible
with the persistence of the N = 28 gap in this chain,
while the B(E2) extracted from a life-time measurement
[30], albeit a low statistics one, suggests the opposite.

Ground-state properties provide complementary and
model-independent probes of nuclear phenomena. Laser-
spectroscopy measurements of mean-square charge radii
along the argon isotopic chain show a pronounced shell
eﬀect at N = 28 [31, 32]. Likewise, mass measurements
performed using the S800 spectrometer at the NSCL sug-
gest the presence of a strong N = 28 shell in the argon
chain [33], but the large uncertainties of these masses
prevent from making deﬁnitive statements. Mass mea-
surements of the N = 28 gap below calcium [34–36] hint
at its possible erosion for chlorine (Z = 17) and sulfur
(Z = 16) but again, no ﬁrm conclusions can be drawn
due to the experimental uncertainties beyond N = 28.

Neutron-rich nuclei in this region of deformation be-
low Z = 20 are also of great theoretical interest. Firstly,
they are fully tractable via state-of-the-art shell-model
calculations. Speciﬁcally, the SDPF-U interaction [37]
was designed to describe the physics inside the N = 28
island of inversion and has succeeded in reproducing ex-
citation spectra in the high-Z part of this region [38].
The merging of the N = 28 and N = 20 islands of in-
version is well described by the SDPF-U Mix interaction
[39], even though the predictions of the two interactions
signiﬁcantly diﬀer in lighter isotopes [14, 40].

Open-shell medium-mass nuclei also provide impor-
tant benchmarks for rapidly developing nuclear ab ini-
tio methods and modern theories of nuclear interactions
based on chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory. In this context ar-
gon isotopes oﬀer a complementary picture to the calcium
chain that constitutes a traditional testing ground. One
such approach, the valence-space formulation of the In-
Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (VS-IMSRG)
[41–45], opened ab initio theories to essentially all nu-
clei accessible to the nuclear shell model, including fully
open-shell exotic systems. The VS-IMSRG provides an
adequate description of the emergence of the N = 32 and
N = 34 sub-shell closures around the calcium chain [46–
49], but its ability to simultaneously describe the collapse
of the N = 28 closure has not yet been tested. Another
approach, the self-consistent Green’s function formalism
in its Gorkov formulation (SCGF) [50], can now target
open-shell nuclei and thus allows the testing of various
Hamiltonians along complete isotopic chains [51, 52].

In this article we report on the high-precision measure-
ment of the neutron rich 46−48Ar isotopes. The question
of the persistence of the N = 28 gap is revisited in light
of the new high-precision data. The new binding energy
trends are ﬁrst compared to predictions from the SDPF-

2

U shell-model interaction, which is believed to well de-
scribe physics in this region of deformation. We then
extend our theoretical investigations to VS-IMSRG cal-
culations, to provide a ﬁrst test with respect to the evo-
lution of the N = 28 shell closure below calcium. Finally,
we present results from SCGF calculations of open-shell
isotopes around the calcium chain using the recently de-
rived NN+3N(lnl) chiral Hamiltonian [52].

II. EXPERIMENT

The measurements reported in this article were per-
formed at the radioactive ion-beam facility ISOLDE at
CERN [55] in July 2015 and August 2017. In both exper-
iments, the radioisotopes of interest were produced using
a thick UCx target which was bombarded with a primary
beam of 1.4-GeV protons delivered by the PS-Booster. A
VADIS VD7 plasma-ion source was used for ionization.
This source was equipped with a water-cooled tantalum
transfer line which inhibits the eﬀusion of the less volatile
species towards the active volume of the source [56]. The
obtained ﬂux of ions was accelerated to a kinetic energy
of 30/50 keV in 2015/2017, respectively. Prior to its de-
livery to the ISOLTRAP on-line mass spectrometer, the
isobars of interest were selected using the ISOLDE High-
Resolution (magnetic-dipole) Separator (HRS).

A schematic representation of the ISOLTRAP mass-
spectrometer [53, 54] is shown in Fig. 1. The radioactive
ions were ﬁrst accumulated in a linear radio-frequency
cooler-buncher trap (RFQ-CB) [57], where the emittance
of the incoming beam was reduced in a few milliseconds
through collisions with the helium buﬀer gas (see Table
I for details).

The ions were extracted from the RFQ-CB in short
bunches, were decelerated by a pulsed drift cavity to a ki-
netic energy of ≈ 3.2 keV and then injected into a Multi-
Reﬂection Time-of-Flight Mass Separator (MR-ToF MS)
[58, 59]. There, the bunch of ions was reﬂected back
and forth repeatedly between two electrostatic mirrors.
As a result, the various isobaric species constituting the
ISOLDE beam were separated in ﬂight time. The beam
composition was studied by measuring the time of arrival
of the diﬀerent beam constituents to a secondary electron
multiplier placed behind the MR-ToF MS. The experi-
mental duty cycle was adapted according to the nature
and abundance of the contamination (see Table I for de-
tails). Typically, the beam was kept for 1000 revolutions
inside the MR-ToF, corresponding to a trapping time of

ambiguously identiﬁed by observing the eﬀect with and
without proton beam. After separation, the selection of
the species of interest was achieved by optimising the tim-
ing and length of the extraction pulse from the MR-ToF
MS [60].

Being a noble gas, argon is characterized by a large ﬁrst
ionization potential and thus is prone to charge-exchange
reactions with neutral impurities contained in the helium

gas of the RFQ-CB [61]. The charge-exchange half-life
inside the RFQ-CB was determined by monitoring the
evolution of the number of stable argon isotopes behind
the MRToF-MS as a function of the RFQ-CB cooling
time. During the 2017 experiment, stable 38Ar+ was used
and the charge-exchange half-life was determined to ini-
tially be 23(2) ms. In order to purify the buﬀer gas, the
He injection line was immersed in a bath of liquid nitro-
gen. Six hours after the installation of this cold trap, the
charge-exchange half-life had improved to 50(13) ms. In
2015, the buncher charge-exchange half-life with the cold
trap was estimated to be 33(5) ms for 36Ar+. In both
runs, the charge-exchange phenomenon was exploited to
distinguish the argon isotopes from the contaminants by
monitoring the count-rate loss in the argon time-of-ﬂight
window as a function of the RFQ-CB trapping time.

After a 90-degree bend, the puriﬁed ion beam entered
ISOLTRAP’s vertical transport section and was captured
in the preparation Penning trap [62].
In this He-ﬁlled
device, further beam puriﬁcation was achieved using the
so-called mass-selective resonant buﬀer-gas cooling tech-
nique [63]. Once again, a cold trap was used to purify
the He-gas injection line. After installation of the cold
traps, the charge exchange half-life in the preparation
Penning trap was 223(38) ms. Consequently, a rather
short processing time (see Table I for details) was used.
Finally, the ion bunch was transported to the precision
Penning trap, where the free cyclotron frequency of the
ion of interest was measured using the Time-of-Flight
Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (ToF-ICR) technique [64].

The ion mass mion,x is connected to its cyclotron fre-

quency by the relation:

,

(1)

where qx is the ion’s charge (in the following we consider
qx = e for all species) and B is the strength of the conﬁn-
ing magnetic ﬁeld. The calibration of the magnetic ﬁeld
is performed by measuring the cyclotron frequency νc,ref
of a reference species of well-known mass mion,ref shortly
before and after the measurement of the species of inter-
est. The cyclotron frequency of the reference species is
then linearly interpolated to the time at which the mea-
surement of the ion of interest was performed. From the
experimentally measured cyclotron-frequency ratio:

the atomic mass of the species of interest is calculated
according to the relation:

matom,x = rref,x(matom,ref − me) + me,

where me is the electron mass [65].

Sometimes the low yield and/or short half-life of an
ion species make a Penning-trap measurement impossi-
ble. In this case, the MR-ToF MS can be used as a mass
spectrometer in its own right. The relationship between

A. The 46Ar mass

During the 2015 experiment, although signiﬁcant
amounts of 92Kr2+ were present in the beam, the most
detrimental A = 46 contaminant was the stable 34S12C+
molecular ion. A mass resolving power of R = m
∆m =
2 × 105 is needed to separate 46Ar+ from this contami-
nant. As a result, a mixture of the two species was trans-
ported to the measurement Penning trap, where a ratio
of 3:1 in favor of the contaminant species was initially
observed. Fortunately, after a few days the outgasing of
the 34S12C+ molecular ion from the target unit reversed
this ratio.

To enhance the collection of argon ions even further,
the ISOLTRAP cycle was synchronized to the proton im-
pact on the ISOLDE target and delayed by 50 ms to
accumulate the argon ions at the maximum of their re-
lease from the target. The RFQ-CB cooling time was
also reduced from 25 ms to 10 ms to minimise charge-
exchange losses. These modiﬁcations meant that two
quasi-pure ToF-ICR resonances of 46Ar+ were recorded.

Figure 2. A typical one-pulse ToF-ICR resonance [64] of
46Ar+ (τ RF
on = 200 ms). The color-map represents the ion
events recorded in each (frequency;tof) bin. The mean and
standard deviation of the time-of-ﬂight distribution recorded
for each frequency is shown as open circles while the red line
shows the result of the least-squares adjustment of the theo-
retical line shape to these data points. The vertical dashed
line indicates the expected cyclotron frequency of the contam-
inant species 34S12C+.

A quadrupole-excitation time of 200 ms was used in both
cases (see Table I for details).

Because of the presence of 34S12C+, extra care was
taken during the analysis procedure. In the present case,
a vast majority of ejections out of the measurement Pen-
ning trap resulted in no ions detected (average count rate
of 0.2 ions/ejections) while 250 events were recorded with
only one ion detected. This number drops by a factor 5
for two ions detected per ejection and even more signiﬁ-
cantly for three ions or more. As a result, the so-called
z-class analysis, a procedure described in [68] to estimate
the eﬀect of contaminants in ToF-ICR resonances could
not be performed here. To limit the impact of resid-
ual contamination, the analysis was performed using the
events where only one ion was detected after the mea-

surement trap.

A typical resonance is shown in Fig. 2. The purity of
the resonance is attested by two factors. First, around
the free cyclotron frequency of 34S12C+ (indicated by the
vertical red dashed line in Fig. 2) very few ion counts are
present between 220 and 240 µs, meaning that very few
excited contaminant ions were recorded. Second, close to
zero frequency detuning, the time-of-ﬂight distribution
for each frequency value does not exhibit a signiﬁcant
amount of ion events detected at time-of-ﬂights around
330 µs, which would indicate the presence of unexcited
contaminant ions.

In the present case, 39K+ (atomic mass m39K =
38963706.487(5) µu [73]) was used as a reference for the
magnetic-ﬁeld calibration. Taking into account the vari-
ous sources of systematic uncertainties described in [68],
one obtains the mean frequency ratio in Table II. This
translates to an atomic mass excess of ME(46Ar) = -
29771.3(23) keV. Fig. 3 shows a comparison between the
value from this work and that obtained from previous
measurements. When compared to the AME2012 value
[72], our new measurement deviates by 41.3 keV but is
20 times more precise. The AME2012 value was pri-
marily determined through two Q-value measurements:
one in 1974 using the 48Ca(6Li,8B)46Ar reaction [69] and
another in 1980 using the 48Ca(14C,16O)46Ar reaction
[70]. These results agree with the new mass and were
complemented by a measurement performed using the
Isochronous Mass Spectrometry technique at the FSR-
ESR storage ring (GSI, Germany) [71] in 2004, which
also agrees but had no weight in the evaluation due to
the larger uncertainty.

B. The 47Ar mass

The 47Ar+ ions were well separated from the other
contaminants so that a pure beam was transported to
the measurement Penning trap. The details of the
ISOLTRAP measurement cycle are summarized in Table
I. In total, three ToF-ICR resonances were recorded using
a quadrupole-excitation time of 100 ms and 200 ms. In
addition, two ToF-ICR resonances in the Ramsey-type
excitation scheme [75, 76] were recorded. This excita-
tion scheme is characterized by the application of two
short radio-frequency pulses of duration τ RF
on which are
coherent in phase and separated by a waiting time τ RF
of f .
For the same total excitation time, this method oﬀers a
three-fold precision improvement in the determination of
the free cyclotron frequency of an ion when compared to
the single-pulse ToF-ICR method. In the present case, a
on − τ RF
τ RF
on = 10 ms - 80 ms - 10 ms excitation
scheme was used. A typical example of such a Ramsey-
resonance is shown in Fig. 4.

of f − τ RF

Here, 39K+ ions were also used for the calibration of
the magnetic ﬁeld. The mean frequency ratio of Table
II can be used to derive an atomic mass excess value
ME(47Ar) = -25367.3(12) keV. Figure 5 shows the com-
parison between the new value from this work and pre-
vious measurements. Compared to the AME2012 value,
our measurement provides a ∼ 90-fold improvement in
precision and is 157 keV more bound. The AME2012 [72]
value is mainly inﬂuenced by a measurement of the Q-
value of the reaction 46Ar(d,p)47Ar [24]. In this study the
authors reported a 700-keV deviation to a previous mea-
surement obtained from the reaction 48Ca(14C,15O)47Ar

48Ar. In order to establish the presence of the radioac-
tive 48Ar+ isotope in the ISOLDE beam, a reference
time-of-ﬂight histogram was built from 21 consecutive
ﬁles recorded with the MR-ToF MS without protons on
target. This histogram was compared with a histogram
resulting from the sum of 13 consecutive ﬁles recorded
with protons on target. To allow the comparison between
the two spectra both were normalized to their total num-
ber of recorded events and superimposed. As seen from
Fig. 6, the A = 48 ISOLDE beam was found to be domi-
nated by the presence of the stable 32S16O+ molecular ion
which was unambiguously identiﬁed by measuring its cy-
clotron frequency in ISOLTRAP’s measurement Penning
trap. At later TOF, a double-peak structure correspond-
ing to stable contamination is also visible. The yields
of these species were too low to allow for the determina-
tion of their cyclotron frequencies using the measurement
Penning trap. Their times of ﬂight were compared to a
wide variety of singly- and doubly-charged atomic and
simple molecular species, none matched.

With protons on target, a 96Kr2+ peak became clearly
visible. Synchronizing the start of the experimental cycle
with the proton impact on target, an excess of counts also
appeared between the two stable undetermined species
within the expected time-of-ﬂight window for 48Ar+.
Varying the RFQ-CB cooling time from 20 to 150 ms,
the absolute strength of this signal was extracted us-
ing the binned, extended maximum likelihood estima-
tion method within a restricted time-of-ﬂight window of
1.1 µs [80]. The probability-density function (PDF) of
the ﬁt was composed of the sum of two Gaussian PDFs
(describing the two stable contaminants) and a uniform
component (to capture the rather high level of baseline
background) while the signal component was also con-
sidered to be described by a Gaussian PDF. In addition,
the three Gaussian PDFs were assumed to share the same
width parameter. In total eight parameters were left free
during the estimation. Hence, we found that the strength
of the studied signal decreases when the RFQ-CB cooling
time is increased at a rate consistent with the observed
charge-exchange half-life.

In total, eight MR-ToF MS spectra were used to per-
form the mass determination of 48Ar+. Each of these
spectra results from the sum of 8 to 20 individual ﬁles

[77]. In addition, the AME2012 also includes two time-
of-ﬂight measurements of 47Ar [34, 78] which due to their
large uncertainty bore no signiﬁcant weights in the evalu-
ation. The close proximity between the mass excesses of
46−47Ar reported in this work and that tabulated in the
AME2016 [73] is due to the fact that a very preliminary
version of the results presented in this work was commu-
nicated to the AME evaluators. Apart from this prelim-
inary value, the AME2016 [73] also includes a time-of-
ﬂight measurement performed at GANIL [79]. As shown
in Table II our results dominate the weight in the ﬁnal
AME2016 adjustment.

yielding the average time-of-ﬂight deviations ∆ti. These
systematic ﬁt deviations ∆ti were then translated into
the individual systematic CT oF uncertainty contributions
∆C f it,i
T oF were added
in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty to yield the
total CT oF uncertainty. Since the statistics is too low
to assess this eﬀect for the 48Ar+ peak, this peak was
attributed the same additional uncertainty contribution
as that of the isobaric 32S16O+ reference, the rest being
purely statistical. This eﬀect contributes 35 % of the ﬁnal
CT oF uncertainty given in Table II. Another systematic-
uncertainty source is the so-called peak-coalescence phe-
nomenon [82] whereby the separation between isobaric
species is reduced due to their Coulomb interaction. To
mitigate this eﬀect the count rate was always kept under
≈8 ions/cycle during the measurement, which has been
shown from many cross-check measurements to be a safe
limit.

Figure 8 provides a direct comparison between the new
value from the present work and previous measurements.
Time-of-ﬂight measurements published in 2015 with the
S800 spectrometer at the NSCL [33] provided the ﬁrst
mass-excess value for 48Ar. Very recently, another such
measurement was reported using the SHARAQ spec-
trometer at RIKEN [46]. This measurement, in agree-
ment with that of NSCL, brought a factor of 2.5 im-
provement in accuracy. Our measurement of the 48Ar
mass excess (see Table II) shows a factor ≈19 improve-
ment in accuracy from the NSCL value while deviating by
74.8 keV. When compared to the RIKEN measurement,
the present value provides a factor ≈7 improvement in
accuracy and deviates by ≈25 keV. Both deviations are
well within one standard deviation of the respective pre-
vious value.

III. DISCUSSION

The mass values obtained in this work were used to
assess the strength of the empirical N = 28 shell gap for
argon. To extract nuclear-structure eﬀects from binding
energies, one typically investigates the variation with N
or Z of ﬁnite binding-energy diﬀerences, also called mass
ﬁlters. One such quantity, the two-neutron separation
energy S2n(N, Z), is presented in Fig. 9 as a function of
N for the isotopic chains with Z = 16−20. S2n is deﬁned
as M E(N − 2, Z) − M E(N, Z) + 2Mn where M E(N, Z)
represents the mass excess of an isotope with N neutrons
and Z protons and Mn is the neutron mass excess. Along
an isotopic chain, the S2n values usually follow a steadily
decreasing trend, while at a shell closure, the magnitude
of this decrease is markedly larger. Figure 9 conﬁrms
that the trend of S2n obtained in this work for Z = 18 is
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than the one obtained using the
results from [33], from which a strong N = 28 shell-gap
in the argon chain was inferred.

In order to examine the strength of the empirical

recorded consecutively. Within this set of 8 spectra, as
few as 30 and as much as 170 ion counts, for a total of
700 ion counts attributed to 48Ar+ were recorded. The
same analysis method and parameters as used for esti-
mating the signal strength were kept for the determina-
tion of the mean TOF of 48Ar+.

Figure 7 shows a typical example of the adjusted
PDF (solid green line). The background component
(dashed blue line) and signal components (dash-dotted
red line) are also represented. For the A = 48 mass de-
termination, the molecular contaminant 32S16O+ present
in the A = 48 spectrum (atomic mass m32S16O =
47966985.794(1) µu [73]) and 85Rb+ (atomic mass m85Rb
= 84911789.738(5) µu [73]) provided by ISOLTRAP’s of-
ﬂine ion source (see Fig. 1) were used as references. The
obtained mean CT oF parameter and its associated uncer-
tainty can be found in Table II.

When one of the reference species is part of the same
time-of-ﬂight spectrum as the ion of interest, the accu-
racy of the MRToF-MS mass measurement is sensitive
to any phenomenon aﬀecting the extracted time-of-ﬂight
diﬀerence between the two species. In this respect, the
main source of systematic uncertainty was found to be
the shape of the time-of-ﬂight distributions. As seen in
Fig. 6, when suﬃcient statistics are collected, the time-
of-ﬂight peaks exhibit clear tailing towards later ﬂight
time. For the sake of consistency, the analysis was per-
formed assuming that all peaks are Gaussian distributed.
To quantify the dependence of the estimated time of
ﬂight on the presence of these tails, the time-of-ﬂight
estimation was performed a second time for the ref-
erence species using the asymmetric peak proﬁle de-
scribed in [81]. For each reference species (i = 1 ,

three-point

This quantity is usually discussed in the context of the
study of the odd-even staggering of binding energies,
but at the crossing of a neutron-shell closure N0 this
staggering is enhanced and ∆3n(N0, Z) is then directly
related to the one-neutron empirical shell gap follow-
ing: ∆1n(N0, Z) = S1n(N0, Z) − S1n(N0 + 1, Z) =
2 × ∆3n(N0, Z). The strength of the empirical one-
neutron shell gap in 46Ar estimated from this work is
∆1n(28, 18) = 4.405(4) MeV. This value is in agreement
with that obtained from the study of the 46Ar(d,p)47Ar
reaction [24]. As a result, even if all the masses measured
in this work are found to be more bound than in [33, 72],
they reveal a net reduction of the N = 28 one-neutron
empirical shell-gap in the argon chain by 73 keV. In
addition, compared to 48Ca, 46Ar exhibits a N = 28
shell gap which is 402(4) keV smaller (see Fig. 10).
Given the doubly magic character of 48Ca, investigating
only the systematics of the mass surface, one would
conclude that the N = 28 shell is a quite robust shell
closure down to Z = 18, thus conﬁrming the ﬁndings of
[33]. On the contrary, the demise of the N = 28 shell
closure in the sulfur chain is suggested by the strong
reduction of the one-neutron shell gap between Z = 18
and Z = 16, although the large uncertainty calls for
precision mass measurements.

In order to gain further insights into the physics at

play within this region of the nuclear chart, the bind-
ing energy trends obtained in this work were confronted
with predictions from various theoretical approaches. To
this end, mean-ﬁeld calculations of even-even and odd-
even argon isotopes were performed using the UNEDF0
energy-density functional [83]. For these calculations a
surface-volume-type pairing interaction was chosen. Its
strength was kept ﬁxed, since the UNEDF0 functional
simultaneously ﬁts this with the other functional param-
eters. The HFBTHO code, which solves the HFB equa-
tions enforcing axial symmetry [84], was used. The odd-N
isotopes were computed performing quasi-particle block-
ing within the so-called equal-ﬁlling approximation [85].
The Lipkin-Nogami prescription was used for approxi-
mate particle-number restoration. The obtained trend of
∆3n(N, Z) is presented in Fig. 11. A ﬁrst observation
is that none of the characteristic features indicative of
shell-closure at N = 28 are reproduced. Furthermore, the
overall scale of the predicted ∆3n(N, Z) trends is greatly
underestimated. This indicates that the adjusted UN-
EDF0 pairing strength is too weak to correctly describe
this region of lighter nuclides.

The spectroscopic results in this region are believed
to be well understood within the framework of the phe-
nomenological shell model [22, 24, 38]. Thus, calcula-
tions were performed using the m-scheme shell-model
code ANTOINE [86, 87] using the SDPF-U shell-model
interaction [37]. In the calculation, the neutron valence
space spans the entire sd-pf shell, while protons are re-
stricted to the sd shell. An additional constraint is that
particle excitations between the sd and pf shells are for-

in agreement with [22], our calculations show that the
ground-state of the doubly-magic 48Ca isotope is built
at ≈90 % on the natural conﬁguration while the ground-
states of 46,48Ar is only built at ≈50 % on this same
conﬁguration. In addition, the monopole and multipole
energy contributions of the calculated ground-state ener-
gies were extracted. While the monopole energy repre-
sents single-particle contributions, of spherical Hartree-
Fock type, the multipole energy was shown to represent
the contribution of correlations to the total energy of a
calculated shell-model state [88]. The evolution of the
calculated ground-state correlation energy for Z = 14-20
and N = 27-29 is shown in Fig. 12. Hence, in agree-
ment with [38], we ﬁnd a rapid increase of correlation
energy south of 48Ca.
In 48,49Ca, correlations account
for ≈2 MeV of the total energy of the ground state. On
the contrary, for 46,47Ar the correlation energy is already
≈11 MeV, when only two protons are removed from the
closed calcium proton core. In comparison, the measured
strength of the one-neutron empirical shell gap is close to
≈4.8 MeV and ≈4.4 MeV for 48Ca and 46Ar respectively.
As a result, in agreement with previous shell-model stud-
ies performed with the phenomenological SDPF-U inter-
action, we ﬁnd that the ground-states of the studied ar-
gon isotopes do not exhibit the expected characteristics
of a typical closed-shell nucleus, but rather suggests that
collectivity is already emerging only two protons below
48Ca.

This observation establishes the argon chain as the
transitional point from the closed-shell region around
calcium towards a region of collectivity below Z = 18.
This conclusion is also supported by other experimental
evidence [22, 23], the most compelling of which is the
spectroscopic factor from a 46Ar(d, p)47Ar transfer reac-
tion [24]. Indeed, this reaction populates a 7/2− state in
47Ar for which the model-dependent determined vacancy
is 1.36(16). Again, this is in contradiction with the ex-
pectations of a naive shell-model picture of a closed-shell
46Ar. As a result, the conclusion drawn from the mass
systematics alone of a strong shell closure in 46Ar [33]
must be nuanced in light of the wealth of experimental
and theoretical data.

The ground states of the measured argon isotopes were
also examined using the ab initio VS-IMSRG approach
[41–45]. The spectroscopic quality of this approach has
been recently studied in light of the ﬁrst measurement
of the 2+
1 state in 52Ar [89]. While the SDPF-U phe-
nomenological interaction provided the best overall de-
scription of the evolution of the 2+
1 states along the ar-
gon chain, the VS-IMSRG approach nonetheless reason-
ably well reproduced this trend up to 52Ar. In this work
we start from the 1.8/2.0 (EM) NN+3N interactions de-
veloped in [90, 91], which reproduces the ground-state
energy systematics, including the location of the proton
and neutron driplines, of nuclei throughout the light to
medium-mass regions [91–95]. Details of the calculations
are the same as those given in [91], unless explicitly stated
otherwise. In particular, we use the Magnus formulation

bidden (i.e., a so-called 0(cid:126)ω calculation).

The trend of ∆3n(N, Z) obtained from the calculated
argon ground states is shown in Fig. 11. A 250-keV oﬀ-
set notwithstanding, the agreement between theory and
experiment is excellent, highlighting the ability of the
SDPF-U interaction to not only reproduce spectroscopy
along the argon isotopic chain [38], but also binding-
energy systematics.

The presence of a strong shell-closure at N = 28 should
be characterized by the predominance of the ν(1f 7/2)8
natural conﬁguration in the ground-state wavefunction
of even Ar isotopes. A so-called intruder conﬁguration
would be characterised by the promotion of at least one
such 1f 7/2 neutron to higher energy orbitals. Hence,

tary transformation to ﬁrst decouple the 28O core energy,
then a proton sd and neutron pf valence-space Hamilto-
nian from the full A-body problem. In addition, with the
ensemble normal-ordering procedure of Ref. [44], we ap-
proximately include eﬀects of 3N forces between valence
nucleons, such that a speciﬁc valence-space Hamiltonian
is constructed for each nucleus to be studied. The ﬁnal
diagonalization is performed using the NuShellX@MSU
shell-model code [98].

The trend of ∆3n(N, Z) obtained from these calcula-
tions is also shown in Fig. 11, revealing that the exper-
imental ∆3n(N, Z) trend is also very well reproduced
along the entire argon chain, particularly the magni-
tude of the one-neutron empirical shell gap. Figure 14
shows the N = 28 two-neutron shell gap, deﬁned as
∆2n = S2n(N, Z) − S2n(N + 2, Z), obtained from var-
ious theoretical approaches as a function of Z. The
VS-IMSRG prediction for the two-neutron shell gap at
Z = 18 is also in good agreement with the one obtained
from the masses measured in this work, despite mod-
estly overestimating it by ≈500 keV. The N = 28 two-
neutron gap for the calcium chain is however overesti-
mated by more than 1 MeV. Nonetheless, we see that
the ab initio approach of the VS-IMSRG oﬀers a consis-
tent framework for predicting the systematics of ground-
and excited-state energies simultaneously throughout the
argon chain.

We also examined the composition of the wavefunc-

complete analogy with the conclusions drawn from the
phenomenological SDPF-U -interaction, we ﬁnd that the
ground state of 46Ar is not majoritarily (≈40 %) built
on the natural ν(1f 7/2)8 conﬁguration while the ground
state of the benchmark doubly closed-shell 48Ca nucleus
is built at ≈90 % on that same conﬁguration. In addi-
tion, to assess the quality of the VS-IMSRG prediction
in this transitional region, we also perform calculations
in the sulfur isotopic chain. The trend of ∆3n(N, Z) ob-
tained from these calculations is shown in Fig. 13. Here
we see that not only the magnitude of the empirical one-
neutron shell gaps in both 48Ca and 46Ar are well re-
produced, but also that the erosion of the N = 28 shell
closure, as extracted from the mass systematics in the
sulfur chain [34–36], emerges ab initio. The marked re-
duction of the predicted N = 28 two-neutron shell gap
from Z = 18 to Z = 16 is apparent also in Fig. 14. There-
fore a precise determination of the 45,46S masses is highly
desirable in order to ﬁrmly assess the agreement between
theory and experiment. While a systematic study of the
entire region is beyond the scope of the present article,
the VS-IMSRG oﬀers a promising and consistent frame-
work to guide future experimental eﬀorts in the region of
deformation below 48Ca.

To complete our ab initio analysis, many-body calcu-
lations within the Gorkov-SCGF approach [50, 99] were
performed for closed- and open-shell
isotopes around
N = 28 and with Z = 16 − 24. Medium-mass nuclei
around Z = 20 had been previously investigated within
this framework [100, 101] using the NN+3N(400) chi-
ral Hamiltonian of Refs. [102–104]. That study had re-
vealed a satisfying reproduction of the binding-energy
trend (namely two-neutron separation energies) for the
Ca, K and Ar chains, although the agreement with ex-

chain. The calculations are extended here using two
more recent Hamiltonians. The ﬁrst such interaction is
the NNLOsat [105], which departs from the traditional
strategy of ﬁtting to only few-body systems, and also
includes observables up to A = 25. This procedure al-
lows to correct for the poor saturation properties of the
original NN+3N(400) Hamiltonian and leads to a reason-
able reproduction of binding energies and charge radii up
to the nickel chain [52]. Another Hamiltonian labelled
NN+3N(lnl) has been proposed to remedy some of the
fundamental shortcomings of the NN+3N(400). Contrar-
ily to NNLOsat, NN+3N(lnl) is adjusted solely on sys-
tems with A = 2, 3 and 4. First benchmark calculations
on O, Ca and Ni chains [52] as well as application to K
and Ca isotopes [48, 106, 107] indicate that it constitutes
a valuable addition to existing chiral Hamiltonians.

The results obtained for elements with Z = 16 − 19
and Z = 21 − 24 with these new Hamiltonians are pre-
sented here for the ﬁrst time. Calculations were per-
formed in a spherical harmonic-oscillator basis including
up to 14 major shells (emax = 13) while the three-body
matrix elements were restricted to e3max = 16 < 3emax.
A ﬁxed oscillator frequency (cid:126)Ω = 20 MeV was used for
the NNLOsat Hamiltonian, while (cid:126)Ω = 18 MeV was cho-
sen for NN+3N(lnl). These correspond to the optimal
values for total binding energies in this mass region [52].
SCGF results with these two Hamiltonians for the
N = 28 two-neutron shell-gap as a function of the proton
number Z are displayed in Fig. 14. First, we observe that
both interactions predict the emergence of the N = 28
shell closure in 48Ca and its progressive demise in 46Ar
and 44S. Nonetheless, a marked diﬀerence between the
SCGF-NN+3N(lnl) and SCGF-NNLOsat values is seen.
The latter generally overestimates the strength of the
two-neutron gap by several MeV, while the former of-
fers a level of agreement with experimental data compa-
rable to that of the VS-IMRSRG. It is noteworthy that
both the VS-IMSRG and SCGF-NN+3N(lnl) approaches
predict a two-neutron gap in 44S of similar magnitude.
Above Z = 20, SCGF calculations ﬁrst follow the exper-
imental trend displaying a decrease of the gap for scan-
dium and titanium, then depart from experimental data
for vanadium and chromium. This disagreement signals
the deterioration of the accuracy for doubly open-shell
systems that display signiﬁcant deformation. Indeed, at
present the Gorkov-SCGF framework achieves an eﬃ-
cient treatment of pairing correlations by breaking the
U(1) symmetry associated to particle number, but en-
forces conservation of rotational symmetry, which leads
to an ineﬃcient account of deformation. While this ap-
proach allows to tackle a large number of open-shell sys-
tems that do not exceedingly depart from sphericity, it
looses accuracy when quadrupole correlations play a ma-
jor role, which is presumably the case for nuclei like 49V
and 50Cr. The fact that this eﬀect is not seen for sulfur
and chlorine isotopes does not contradict the ﬁndings of
the shell-model calculations, but rather points to a more

mild impact of collectivity in those nuclei, at least for the
description of the ground states.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, we performed high-precision measure-
ments of the atomic masses of 46−48Ar using the
ISOLTRAP mass spectrometer at ISOLDE/CERN. De-
spite severe stable molecular contamination, the masses
of 46−47Ar were successfully measured using the ToF-ICR
method in a Penning trap, while the mass of 48Ar was
determined by use of MR-ToF mass spectrometry. No
statistically signiﬁcant deviations were found when com-
pared to literature values, but the uncertainties were re-
duced by up to a factor 90. The trends of nuclear binding
energies obtained from the measured masses were used to
probe the N = 28 shell closure in neutron-rich argon iso-
topes. The systematics of the one- and two-neutron shell
gaps indicate the presence of a persistent, yet reduced
empirical shell gap in 46Ar compared to the doubly magic
48Ca, in accordance with results of previous mass mea-
surements. More speciﬁcally, the one-neutron empirical
shell gap is found to be reduced by only 402(4) keV be-
tween 48Ca and 46Ar. However, taking into account the
wealth of spectroscopic data available and using shell-
model calculations performed with the SDPF-U inter-
action, this conclusion must be nuanced. Indeed, 46Ar
is found to form a transition point between the doubly
closed-shell 48Ca and the collective 44S ground state.

A theoretical investigation of the measured isotopes
was also performed using state-of-the-art ab-initio ap-
proaches. The VS-IMSRG calculations reproduce the
ground-state energy behavior in the argon chain as well
as the phenomenological SDPF-U interaction, thus pro-
viding an ab initio description of the underlying physics
in this region. SCGF calculations were also performed
using two diﬀerent Hamiltonians, NNLOsat and the re-
cently derived NN+3N(lnl). Also in this case a progres-
sive reduction of the empirical two-neutron shell-gap was
observed from Z = 20 to Z = 16. While SCGF-NNLOsat
results overestimate the strength of the two-neutron shell
gap at (Z, N )=(18, 28), SCGF-NN+3N(lnl) closely fol-
low those obtained from the VS-IMSRG, conﬁrming the
very good performance of the NN+3N(lnl) interaction in
this mass region.

Accurate mass measurements extending the present
study to more neutron-rich argon isotopes approaching
N = 32, 34 and to the sulfur isotopes beyond N = 28
are highly desirable to put the predictions from the pre-
sented ab initio approaches to the test. To this end, the
present mass values constitute ideal anchor points for fu-
ture experimental campaigns reaching further away from
stability.
