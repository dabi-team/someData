ABSTRACT

Solar ﬂares are explosive releases of magnetic energy. Hard X-ray (HXR) ﬂare emission originates
from both hot (millions of Kelvin) plasma and nonthermal accelerated particles, giving insight into ﬂare
energy release. The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) utilizes direct focusing optics
to attain much higher sensitivity in the HXR range than that of previous indirect imagers. This paper
presents eleven NuSTAR microﬂares from two active regions (AR 12671 on 2017 August 21, and AR
12712 on 2018 May 29). The temporal, spatial, and energetic properties of each are discussed in context
with previously published HXR brightenings. They are seen to display several ‘large-ﬂare’ properties,
such as impulsive time proﬁles and earlier peaktimes in higher energy HXRs. For two events where
active region background could be removed, microﬂare emission did not display spatial complexity:
diﬀering NuSTAR energy ranges had equivalent emission centroids. Finally, spectral ﬁtting showed a
high energy excess over a single thermal model in all events. This excess was consistent with additional
higher-temperature plasma volumes in 10/11 microﬂares, and consistent only with an accelerated
particle distribution in the last. Previous NuSTAR studies focused on one or a few microﬂares at a
time, making this the ﬁrst to collectively examine a sizable number of events. Additionally, this paper
introduces an observed variation in the NuSTAR gain unique to the extremely low-livetime (<1%)
regime, and establishes a correction method to be used in future NuSTAR solar spectral analysis.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar ﬂares are dramatic manifestations of change in
the magnetic structure of the solar corona. They have
been observed across over seven orders of magnitude in
estimated GOES (Geostationary Operational Environ-
mental Satellite) soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂux. The accepted
model of ﬂare production involves energy released by
magnetic reconnection (e.g. Benz 2016). During this
process, particles are accelerated to high energies by dy-
namic ﬁelds and emit bremsstrahlung radiation through
interactions with ambient coronal plasma (e.g. Brown
1971).

In addition to this nonthermal emission, ﬂares also
show signiﬁcant thermal emission from plasma heated
to high temperatures as a result of various mechanisms
of energy release. Both nonthermal emission and ther-

mal emission from the hottest ﬂare plasma (millions of
Kelvin) are evident in the hard X-ray (HXR) band, with
nonthermal emission dominating at the highest energies
(Dennis et al. 2011).

The Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic
Imager (RHESSI) operated from 2002 to 2018, and al-
lowed for extensive investigation of large ﬂares using an
indirect Fourier imaging method to observe from 3 keV
to 17 MeV (Lin et al. 2002). In addition, RHESSI was
used for statistical HXR studies of GOES A- and B-class
microﬂares (Christe et al. 2008; Hannah et al. 2008; Han-
nah et al. 2011). However, the large detector volume
required by RHESSI ’s imaging method caused a high
background that limited the instrument’s sensitivity to
fainter events.

Figure 1. NuSTAR emission between 2-10 keV is shown for the four orbits containing the 11 microﬂares. UTC times are
shown in HH:MM format. Each lightcurve has been livetime-corrected, and binned in 10s intervals. Microﬂaring intervals are
marked in blue, and labeled for future reference (these short ﬂare IDs are adopted for reference throughout this work; refer to
Table 5 for standard Solar Object Locator target IDs). Diﬀering y-scale between each of the four full-orbit lightcurves is noted,
reﬂecting variable levels of activity in AR 12712 at diﬀerent times (among the May 2018 orbits), and the comparatively higher
level of activity observed from AR 12671 in August 2017.

Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) rocket campaigns
have demonstrated the signiﬁcantly greater sensitivity
possible with direct focusing HXR optics (Harrison et al.
2013; Glesener et al. 2016). These instruments allow
unprecedented opportunity for analysis of microﬂares,
events with energy content estimated to be around six
orders of magnitude less than that of the brightest solar
ﬂares. NuSTAR and FOXSI are capable of observing
the very faintest A-class events, as well as brightenings
that are too faint to be observed by GOES.

Flare occurrence rate is inversely related to magni-
tude, with fainter events observed far more frequently
than brighter ones (e.g. Hannah et al. 2011). Because of
this, a large ensemble of extremely faint ﬂaring events,
or nanoﬂares, are a theorized mechanism for observed
large-scale heating of the solar corona (e.g. Parker 1988;
Klimchuk 2006). Nanoﬂares would be faint and frequent
enough that it would currently be impossible to detect
them individually. They would occur across the en-
tire corona, even in quiet regions with little evidence
of large-scale magnetic activity. In this way, their com-
bined eﬀect could provide the energy necessary for coro-
nal heating, which is not suﬃciently accounted for by
the energy released in observed ﬂare populations (e.g.
Hudson 1991).

It has been proposed that nanoﬂares originate from a
reconnection process similar to that of standard ﬂares,
but at a much smaller energy scale (e.g. Parker 1988).
It remains unknown how frequently they might oc-
cur, whether they also accelerate particles, and the
amount of energy that they could release. To reﬁne
our understanding of the emission we might expect from

nanoﬂares, it is essential to investigate how ﬂare prop-
erties change over a wide range of magnitudes. This
particularly motivates the study of small microﬂares ob-
served by current-generation focusing instruments, the
faintest events ever observed in HXRs.

This paper provides detailed analysis of eleven mi-
croﬂares observed by NuSTAR, with emphasis on char-
acterization of their higher-energy spectral properties
and examination of the correspondence between their
temporal and spatial properties and those of larger
ﬂares. To provide context, Section 2 will present an
overview of the process and history of NuSTAR solar
observation, and also introduce the host of microﬂares.
Sections 3 and 4 will include consideration of their tem-
poral and spatial properties in context with those of
larger ‘standard’ size ﬂares. Finally, Section 5 will con-
sider the spectral properties of each observed event,
determining for each whether the emission is best ex-
plained by a multi-thermal plasma model alone, or by a
combination of thermal and nonthermal components.

2. NUSTAR SOLAR OBSERVATION

NuSTAR is a NASA Small Explorer mission launched
in 2012.
It has two co-aligned focusing X-ray optics
designed to observe in the 3-79 keV band (with the
range down to 2.5 keV usable in some high-ﬂux observa-
tions (Grefenstette et al. 2016)), 18” angular resolution
(FWHM), and a 12(cid:48)x12(cid:48) ﬁeld of view (FOV) (Harrison
et al. 2013). Data from the two telescopes are identiﬁed
by reference to the focal plane module (FPM) associated
with each detector (FPMA, FPMB). NuSTAR is an as-
trophysical mission, and as such faces limitations when

In
particular, high ﬂux rates can cause low detector live-
time when observing brighter solar events, making NuS-
TAR primarily suitable for observation of small ﬂares,
quiescent active regions, and the quiet Sun. NuSTAR
also has a pointing uncertainty of up to a few arcmin-
utes in absolute astrometry when observing the Sun, as
its forward-facing star-tracking camera is blinded by the
solar disk (e.g. Glesener et al. 2017). To mitigate this
uncertainty, NuSTAR data can be co-aligned with ex-
treme ultraviolet (EUV) context data.

NuSTAR can experience abrupt jumps in pointing
associated with changes in the combination of star-
tracking camera head units (CHUs) being used to deter-
mine its orientation (Grefenstette et al. 2016). The oc-
currence of these shifts is well documented within NuS-
TAR data structures, and is considered in every stage
of the analysis process. CHU shifts can restrict which
time intervals can be easily used for spectroscopy.

Despite these limitations, NuSTAR has completed a
growing number of solar observation campaigns over the
last few years, many of which have included observation
of both active region microﬂares and quiet Sun brighten-
ings. The magnitudes of these small events are generally
compared in terms of their GOES class, a ﬂare classiﬁca-
tion scheme based on X-ray brightness in the 1-8 ˚A range
as observed by GOES satellites. NuSTAR microﬂares
studied so far have all been A-class or smaller, implying
a brightness below 10-7 watts m-2 (A-class events), or
below 10-8 watts m-2 (sub-A-class events).

NuSTAR observations have allowed multiple detailed
studies of sub-A-class events in active regions, as well
as one paper concerned with three even smaller (GOES
∼A0.01) quiet Sun brightenings (Glesener et al. 2017;
Wright et al. 2017; Cooper et al. 2020; Kuhar et al.
2018). The spectra of events in Glesener et al. (2017),
Kuhar et al. (2018), and Cooper et al. (2020) were best
ﬁt by isothermal spectral models throughout their evo-
lution, though the Glesener et al. (2017) microﬂare dis-
played some high-energy excess over this ﬁt during the
impulsive phase. Pre-ﬂare, post-ﬂare, and decay phase
spectra of the event presented in Wright et al. (2017)
were also best ﬁt by a single thermal model, but the
addition of a second higher-temperature thermal model
was required to account for high energy excess during
its impulsive phase.

Additionally, two papers discuss slightly larger events.
One considers an A1 class microﬂare that is the ﬁrst
observed by both NuSTAR and the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ), making it the ﬁrst event
at this scale where HXR coronal emission has been
compared with corresponding cooler chromospheric UV

3

emission as seen by IRIS (Hannah et al. 2019). The
other presents a GOES A7.7 1 event that is the ﬁrst
NuSTAR microﬂare to show clear evidence of nonther-
mal emission (Glesener et al. 2020). This last event oc-
curred alongside several other microﬂares during a 2017
August 21 NuSTAR observation, and is also discussed
in this paper.

Limited NuSTAR solar observing time means that full
statistical A-class or sub-A-class microﬂare studies will
have to wait for the introduction of a solar-dedicated
focusing HXR mission. However,
it is still valuable
to strive for a more systematic understanding of these
uniquely faint solar brightenings than we can gain from
single-event studies. This motivates the analysis of the
eleven events presented here.

2.1. Overview of Events

On 2017 August 21, NuSTAR observed a solar active
region for an orbit of around an hour (NuSTAR observa-
tion IDs 20312001001 and 20312002001). This observa-
tion was granted in conjunction with the “Great Amer-
ican Eclipse” and ended with the eclipse of NuSTAR’s
FOV on the Sun by the Moon. Before the eclipse, four
microﬂares of (background subtracted) GOES A-class
or below occurred in the NuSTAR FOV, all originating
within the targeted active region (NOAA designation
AR 12671). The evolution of emission during the single
orbit is shown in the top left panel of Figure 1.

On 2018 May 29, NuSTAR observed two solar active
regions over the course of ﬁve orbits, each around an
hour in duration. During this time, NuSTAR recorded
HXR emission from seven microﬂares, also all A-class
or below. Six of these events were initially identiﬁed
by visual inspection of NuSTAR lightcurves. The last
(may1917) was identiﬁed after a more rigorous method
for identifying transients was applied. This set a series of
conditions on the derivative of the NuSTAR lightcurve
to identify ﬂare-like local maxima, based on the ﬂare-
ﬁnding algorithm used in Christe et al. (2008) for a
statistical study of RHESSI microﬂares. All of the
May events occurred during the ﬁrst three orbits (NuS-
TAR observation IDs 80410201001, 80410201002 and
80410201003) and within the same active region (NOAA
designation AR 12712). NuSTAR lightcurves for these
three orbits are shown in the remaining panels of Figure
1.

1 In Glesener et al. (2020) the background-subtracted GOES class
for this event was reported as A5.7; the diﬀerence is due to the
use of re-processed GOES data released in May 2020 for this
study.

one ‘ideal’ case, and two events where properties of the data or event caused challenges. Fitting intervals are shaded pink, ﬁtted
models (red) are plotted over NuSTAR data, and the extracted start, peak, and end times (teal, purple, blue) are marked. The
left panels show a microﬂare (may1618) with a smooth, impulsive proﬁle in all energy ranges (the ‘ideal’ case). Center panels
show the handling of a smaller event (may1736) with comparatively lower statistics available from 8-10 keV, and where the
ﬁtting interval is cut oﬀ by the rise of the next microﬂare. The right panels show an event (aug1850) that begins before the
start of the NuSTAR data interval and has a bump-like feature after the peak that prompted further trimming of the ﬁtting
interval to achieve a reasonable result.

NuSTAR observation of this particular region was
motivated by the opportunity for co-observation with
the Hi-C 2.1 sounding rocket, the ﬂight of which oc-
curred between two of the NuSTAR observation inter-
vals. Other co-observing instruments included the IRIS
high-resolution UV slit spectrometer, the Hinode X-
Ray Telescope (XRT) and Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS), as well as the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) aboard NASA’s Solar Dynamics Obser-
vatory (SDO) (Lemen et al. 2012). Detailed analysis of
AR 12712 during the quiescent interval of the Hi-C 2.1
ﬂight is presented in Warren et al. (2020). The oppor-
tunity to incorporate results from Hinode and IRIS to-
gether with the NuSTAR dataset is noted as an exciting
area of future investigation.

3. TEMPORAL EVOLUTION

The temporal structure of HXR emission in large
ﬂares (>B-class) is commonly impulsive, exhibiting a
fast rise followed by a gradual fall. This is understood
to imply an initial rapid release of energy to plasma heat-
ing and/or particle acceleration, followed by a lengthier
decay interval as the heated plasma cools back down to
temperatures below those that emit in the HXR band
(e.g. Benz 2016).

The time proﬁle of higher energy HXR emission is
generally observed to be more impulsive than that of
the lower energy emission (lower energy HXRs, or SXR
emission and lower energies), and also to peak earlier
in time. This is consistent with a transfer of energy
from accelerated particle populations and smaller, hot-

ter plasma volumes into heating of the surrounding chro-
mospheric plasma, as well as with gradual cooling over
time. Both impulsivity and diﬀerential peak times be-
tween energy ranges are considered part of the “stan-
dard” ﬂare model (e.g. Benz 2016)), and consistent ob-
servation of them in microﬂare events would support
the idea that the evolution of events at this scale is con-
trolled by processes similar to those that lead to large
ﬂares.

3.1. Time Proﬁle Analysis Method

To examine these properties in the microﬂares consid-
ered here, four HXR energy bands were chosen within
the observed NuSTAR energy range (2-4 keV, 4-6 keV,
6-8 keV, 8-10 keV). An event asymmetry index (Aev) cal-
culated from the rise and decay times (trise, tdecay) was
used to examine the impulsivity in all 44 cases (4 energy
bands × 11 events). This index was previously utilized
to characterize the events in a RHESSI microﬂare study
(Christe et al. 2008), following the example of Temmer
et al. (2002). It is given as,

Aev =

tdecay − trise
tdecay + trise

(1)

with a resulting value greater than zero implying an im-
pulsive event.

Time proﬁles were created,

including all NuSTAR
emission (FPMA, FPMB summed) observed in each en-
ergy range, integrated over selected regions. For May
2018, the regions chosen encompassed the full active re-
gion (AR 12712), which involved a relatively compact

times (teal, purple, blue) are marked. In some cases (aug1850, may1606, may1917), the ﬁt interval was trimmed to minimize the

set of loops. In contrast, the August 2017 active region
(AR 12671) was more structurally complex and highly
elongated. In order to isolate microﬂare-speciﬁc tempo-
ral behavior, the regions chosen for August microﬂares
included only the western half of the active region, the
location of all four ﬂare sites (see Figure 7 for NuSTAR
microﬂare emission plotted over AIA active region con-
text data).

The time proﬁles included livetime-corrected NuSTAR
counts from several minutes before and after any ﬂare
emission was noticeable by eye, binned in 1s intervals.
For a few events, the microﬂare either began or ended
outside of the period of NuSTAR observation, in which
case as much of the ﬂare-time interval was included as
possible.

An automated method was developed to extract ﬂare
start, peak, and end times from each time proﬁle. A
model composed of a linear combination of skewed gaus-
sian and linear functions (to represent ﬂaring and back-
ground emission, respectively) was ﬁt to each time pro-
ﬁle, using the LMFIT Python package (Newville et al.
2014). The skewed gaussian model was chosen for its
ability to ﬂexibly ﬁt both impulsive and non-impulsive
time proﬁles. The combination of the two functions re-

quires six parameters to be ﬁt (for the skewed gaussian:
the center, width (σ), amplitude, and skewness (γ); for
the linear component: the slope and intercept).

Fit quality was observed to be sensitive to the choice of
initial conditions, so the ﬁtting process was repeated it-
eratively for an array of initial conditions for three of the
ﬁt parameters (the gaussian center, σ, and amplitude).
Optimal sets of initial conditions were found (those re-
sulting in the best ﬁt, with goodness-of-ﬁt determined
via the chi-squared value). Using these, best ﬁt param-
eters were extracted. This was repeated for each of the
44 time proﬁles. Figure 2 shows the available NuSTAR
data, the interval used for ﬁtting, and the ﬁt results in
all four energy ranges for three selected events, while

considered.

may1940), the full evolution of the event was not cap-
tured in the NuSTAR data: the interval was cut short
by either the boundaries of the observation, or by an-
other ﬂaring event occurring shortly after. With the
use of ﬁt results, start/end times were estimated even
beyond the available NuSTAR data in these cases. Ad-
ditionally, three events (may1850, may1606, may1917)
contained bumps in the decay interval which distorted
ﬁt results, pushing end times well beyond a value that
seemed physical. For these events, the interval used for
ﬁtting was manually trimmed to avoid including these
features.

Uncertainty in peak times was dependent on LMFIT
output 1-σ standard errors in both the center and γ of
the distribution, while uncertainties in start and stop
times were additionally dependent on the error in σ. To
extract uncertainties, ﬁts were iteratively re-run for each
time proﬁle wherein the center, γ, and σ were randomly
assigned to values within their output error range each
time, and then held ﬁxed while the other three param-
eters remained free. Peak, start, and end time uncer-
tainties were taken as the standard deviation of their
resulting values.

3.2. Peak Times & Impulsivity

Table 1 shows the event asymmetry index, Aev, for
each microﬂare in each of the four energy ranges. Events
are arranged from brightest (top) to faintest (bottom)
considering the maximum NuSTAR count rate during
each (livetime corrected and background subtracted).
The majority (36/43, dark green) of the time proﬁles
are conﬁrmed to be impulsive, and 6 more (light green)
are consistent with either an impulsive or non-impulsive
evolution.

One event (aug1909) was consistent with both impul-
sive and non-impulsive proﬁles in 3/4 energy ranges.
This was the shortest-duration microﬂare (<2 minutes).
While start, peak, and end time uncertainties in this
event were not notably larger than those found for oth-
ers, they are larger in proportion to the ﬂare duration,
leading to large uncertainty ranges in Aev in the higher
energies. The lack of conﬁrmed impulsivity in these time
proﬁles therefore reﬂects a limitation of the available
statistics.

Note—Aev was calculated using trise and tdecay found independently in
each energy range. Due to poor statistics, the 8-10 keV range for the
faintest event (may1917) was excluded from analysis.

The reported values of Aev represent the location of
the time proﬁle peak within the event duration in each
energy range. It is also interesting to compare time pro-
ﬁle peaks in each energy range to the full event dura-
tion (deﬁned as the interval from the earliest start to
the latest end found in any of the energy ranges for each
event; in all 11 microﬂares this was equal to the 2-4 keV
event duration). The peak times of emission in all en-
ergy ranges for each microﬂare are shown in Figure 4.
In order to visually compare between energy ranges for
all microﬂares simultaneously, the peak times were nor-
malized over each 2-4 keV event duration. Linear trends
in peak time across the four energy ranges were calcu-
lated for each microﬂare. 10/11 resulting trendlines had
negative slopes, conﬁrming observation of the large-ﬂare
property of earlier peak times in higher energy emission.

large population of GOES ﬂares in Ryan et al. (2012)).
NuSTAR’s energy resolution allows for ﬂare tempera-
tures to be more accurately extracted from spectroscopy
(see Section 5). However, the need to include enough
counts to make spectral ﬁtting meaningful limits the
temporal resolution possible when examining the evo-
lution of ﬂare plasma parameters over the course of an
event. Hardness ratios (ratios between counts in higher
and lower NuSTAR energy ranges) do not have this lim-
itation.

Two diﬀerent hardness ratios were examined in these
events: R4/2 (ratio of 4-6 keV emission and 2-4 keV
emission), and R8/4 (ratio of 8-10 keV emission and 4-6
keV emission). Figure 5 shows both ratios as a func-
tion of time during two example events, with normalized
NuSTAR emission in all four energy ranges included for
context. The hardness ratios are normalized over the
ﬂaring interval for visual convenience in comparing be-
tween R4/2 and R8/4.

These events are representative of the population of
microﬂares, all of which showed ratios with structure
similar to that of the regular NuSTAR time proﬁles,
peaking either simultaneously or earlier in time. The
exceptions to this were smaller events, where limited

Figure 4. Microﬂare peak times are shown, normalized over
the 2-4 keV event duration such that a value of 0 would imply
the microﬂare peaks the moment it begins, while a value of
0.5 would imply a peak halfway through the duration. Peak
times are shown in all four energy ranges, with error bars
showing uncertainties for each. A linear ﬁt is included for
each event, and resulting slopes (m) are reported with 1-
σ uncertainties. The data are consistent with a negative
slope only in 10/11 cases (a slope of zero was found for the
faintest event, may1917, which had suﬃcient counts to be
well-ﬁt in only three energy ranges). This shows a trend
toward earlier peak times in the higher energy ranges. Events
are arranged from brightest (top) to faintest (bottom) by
the maximum NuSTAR count rate (livetime corrected and
background subtracted) during each interval.

ratio of this ﬂux at two diﬀerent energies can be shown
to be a monotonically increasing function of T.

With suﬃcient knowledge of instrument response, this
relationship can be used to determine the evolution of
ﬂare temperature in absolute terms (as was done for a

statistics in the 8-10 keV energy range challenged the
interpretation of R8/4.

Table 2 gives peak times in each of the hardness ra-
tios for each microﬂare, events again arranged by magni-
tude of peak NuSTAR counts (livetime corrected, back-
ground subtracted). The ratio peak times are reported
as fractions of the full 2-4 keV event duration in each
case. Uncertainties were found by applying a range of
diﬀerent smoothing intervals to each ratio curve before
taking the maximum, and using the standard deviation
of the resulting peak times as the reported uncertainty.
The uncertainty associated with the choice of smooth-
ing interval was seen to dwarf that due to the inherent
statistical uncertainty of the NuSTAR data. For both
ratios in all eleven microﬂares, the peak occurs in the
ﬁrst half of the event. The mean values of the peaks
(times of maximum microﬂare temperature assuming an
isothermal emitting plasma) are 0.176±0.034 (R4/2) and
0.156± 0.043 (R8/4) when averaged over all events ex-
cept aug1850.

3.4. Neupert Eﬀect

The Neupert eﬀect describes the tendency for ﬂaring
HXR or microwave emission to show correlation with
the derivative of the lightcurve of emission in lower en-
ergy ranges, as noted in Neupert (1968). Observation
of this property is interpreted to support the idea that
plasma heating resulting in EUV and SXR emission is
caused by the deposition of energy by beams of nonther-

Figure 6. Correlation results between NuSTAR and the
derivatives of lower-energy emission for two events. For each
event, three plots are shown (Top: GOES derivatives over
the cross-correlation interval, with full ﬂare duration NuS-
TAR and raw GOES lightcurves for context. Middle: the
same is shown comparing NuSTAR and AIA. Bottom: nor-
malized NuSTAR emission is shown in all four energy ranges
over the ﬂare duration. Legends on the GOES and AIA
lightcurves include the correlation coeﬃcient (CC) and asso-
ciated shift.). Upper Event: (may1618) time proﬁles are
best correlated with AIA 94 ˚A and GOES 1-8 ˚A derivatives
when they are shifted forward in time (not consistent with
the Neupert eﬀect). Lower Event: (aug1850, an event con-
ﬁrmed to contain nonthermal emission) The 8-10 keV time
proﬁle is best correlated with the AIA 94 ˚A derivative with no
shift, and the rise in 6-8 keV is well correlated with the GOES
1-8 ˚A derivative even before a shift is applied to maximize
the mathematical correlation (consistent with the Neupert
eﬀect).

mal accelerated electrons, which are in turn the source
of emission in the HXR band (Dennis & Zarro 1993).

In order to look for evidence of this, co-temporal
lower energy emission was examined in conjunction with
higher-energy (6-8 keV, 8-10 keV) NuSTAR time pro-
ﬁles. SXR emission was taken from the GOES 1-8 ˚A
passband, and EUV from the SDO/AIA 94 ˚A channel,
the latter spatially integrated over the relevant active re-
gions. This meant that, in total, 44 pairs of lightcurves

croﬂares × 2 lower-energy instruments).

AIA and GOES time proﬁles were smoothed over 2
minute boxcar intervals before their derivatives were
taken, with the aim of highlighting longer-term tempo-
ral structure over background ﬂuctuations. This was
modiﬁed in the case of aug1909, where the GOES and
AIA emission were smoothed over 1 minute instead due
to the < 2 minute event duration.
Intervals were se-
lected over which to compare NuSTAR emission with
the GOES or AIA derivatives, including only the times
where the GOES or AIA derivatives were non-negative.
NuSTAR data were binned to match the cadence of the
lower-energy instruments, and emission in each of the
instruments was normalized.

Cross correlation between each pair of lightcurves was
computed using the C CORRELATE function in IDL, re-
porting the maximum correlation coeﬃcient found and
its associated lag. Figure 6 shows the best-correlated
result (from either the 6-8 or 8-10 keV comparison) for
both GOES and AIA for two events.

In 18/22 AIA comparisons and 17/22 GOES compar-
isons, the best correlation between NuSTAR emission
and the lower energy derivative was found after a pos-
itive shift of the derivative in time (positive lag), im-
plying the lower-energy derivative peaks earlier in time
than the NuSTAR emission. An example of this can be
seen in the upper panel of Figure 6.

If an increase in the amount of plasma emitting in
a given SXR or EUV energy range were the result of
heating by a nonthermal particle population, the deriva-
tive would be expected to peak at the same time as (or
later than) the nonthermal emission. In contrast, events
best-correlated with a positive lag are explainable by en-
tirely thermal emission in both the HXR and SXR/EUV
ranges, and are not consistent with the Neupert eﬀect.
This appears to be the dominant behavior among this
population.

Considering the events not best-correlated when a
positive lag is applied, the majority were cases in which
the correlation between NuSTAR and the lower energy
derivative was weak, or seemed unphysical. Some of the
smallest events were faint enough to be diﬃcult to dis-
cern in the GOES light curves, but even some that were
visible did not display a strong correlation. This is likely
indicative of a more complex physical situation than is
assumed by either the Neupert eﬀect or the simple ther-
mal scenario described above.

Microﬂare aug1850, which was conﬁrmed to involve
signiﬁcant nonthermal emission in Glesener et al. (2020),
is the only event to show behavior consistent with the
Neupert eﬀect with the use of this method. Speciﬁ-

9

cally, the AIA derivative is best-correlated with both
the NuSTAR 6-8 keV and 8-10 keV time proﬁles when
no lag is applied at all (see lower panel of Figure 6). The
GOES derivative, while requiring a small positive shift
to achieve the best mathematical correlation, does also
qualitatively appear well-correlated with the rise of the
NuSTAR emission in both energy ranges without being
shifted at all (6-8 keV correlation coeﬃcients: 0.399 (no
shift), 0.478 (28s shift); 8-10 keV correlation coeﬃcients:
0.357 (no shift), 0.457 (58s shift)).

4. SPATIAL PROPERTIES

NuSTAR’s imaging capabilities allow for comparison
between the spatial distribution of observed HXR emis-
sion with that of EUV emission observed by SDO/AIA.
NuSTAR’s 18” angular resolution (FWHM) means that
larger active region loops
structure on the scale of
can be resolved, though much of the ﬁner loop spa-
tial structure visible in AIA is not. As a ﬁrst step in
investigating spatial properties of the observed emis-
sion, NuSTAR’s pointing stability was examined over
each ﬂaring interval.
In 10/11 microﬂares, the CHU
combination and pointing were stable over the entire
ﬂare (may1606, may1736, may1917, may1940, aug1900,
aug1909), or over the rise and peak times (may1646,
may1618, may1747, aug1918). For these events, data
from the dominant (or rise/peak) CHU combination
were used to make images, reducing event duration in
some cases (the same intervals were later used for spec-
troscopy in Section 5). For aug1850, multiple CHU
changes occurred during the rise/peak, so the CHU with
the largest eﬀective exposure was chosen for imaging.

Depending on the location of the detector chip gap
in relation to an observed source, one FPM may be
more ideal for imaging in any given observation. FPMA
was better oriented during the May 2018 observation,
while FPMB was better during all August 2017 events.
To make images, NuSTAR emission from one FPM
was integrated in time over the CHU-stable intervals
for each microﬂare. NuSTAR’s point-spread function
was then deconvolved over an event- and energy-range-
speciﬁc number of iterations using the IDL procedure
max likelihood.pro.

Because NuSTAR is sensitive at temperatures similar
to those that most strongly produce the Fe XVIII line
(peak formation temperature of log(T)≈6.9 (Del Zanna
et al. 2015)), AIA Fe XVIII images can be used to ap-
proximate the most likely true center of NuSTAR emis-
sion, reducing the instrument’s inherent pointing uncer-
tainty during solar observation. AIA Fe XVIII images
were produced using an established linear combination
of three channels (94˚A, 171˚A, and 211˚A) to isolate Fe

Figure 7. NuSTAR contours (20, 40, 60, 80% of counts) are shown over AIA 94˚A context images during six of the eleven
microﬂares. NuSTAR 2-4 keV and >6 keV emission during each event has been integrated over stable pointing intervals and
deconvolved over ﬂare- and energy range- speciﬁc numbers (i) of iterations. Emission centroids in each energy range are also
marked. Circles with diameters equal to the NuSTAR HPD ((cid:46)70” in this energy range) and FWHM (18” ) are shown for
visual reference (Madsen et al. 2015). Upper Panels: Three of the August 2017 microﬂares are shown, each with unique
morphology involving diﬀerent parts of the complex, multi-loop structure of AR 12671 (see Glesener et al. (2020) for images
of microﬂare aug1850). No pre-ﬂare background has been removed, as no times during the NuSTAR observation of this region
could be considered quiescent. The same number of iterations were used for deconvolution of each (2-4 keV: i=200, >6 keV:
i=100). Lower Panels: In contrast, emission in all May 2018 events was dominated by the contributions of two similarly
shaped structures (an ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ set of loops). The lower left panel shows microﬂare may1736 (no pre-ﬂare background
has been removed in this case, 2-4 keV: i=100, >6 keV: i=50). This event involved signiﬁcant NuSTAR emission from both the
‘upper’ and ‘lower’ loop structures. The center panel shows may1940, an event primarially involving the ‘upper’ loop structure
(2-4 keV: i=100, >6 keV: i=50), while the right (may1618) shows one dominated by the ‘lower’ (2-4 keV: i=200, >6 keV:
i=100). May1618 was the brightest of the May 2018 microﬂares, and has had background emission removed. No signiﬁcant
energy-dependent diﬀerence in NuSTAR centroid was found for this event.

XVIII emission (Del Zanna 2013). Diﬀerenced Fe XVIII
images were then created (peak time in NuSTAR 2-4
keV minus a pre-ﬂare time).

Finally, for each ﬂare, the deconvolved NuSTAR con-
tours were manually coaligned to the diﬀerenced Fe
XVIII images. Figure 7 shows NuSTAR emission from
six microﬂares as contours over AIA 94˚A context. The
number of deconvolution iterations used for each energy
range in each event are given in the image caption.

4.1. Spatial Complexity

Diﬀerences in the centroid of ﬂare-time emission in
diﬀerent HXR energy ranges could provide evidence
of a plasma temperature gradient across the ﬂare site.
Alternatively, such diﬀerences could highlight spatially
distinct thermal and nonthermal sources, such as the
common scenario of nonthermal loop footpoint sources
in large ﬂares observed in conjunction with thermal
emission from ﬂare loops (e.g. Benz 2016). To deter-

ground active region emission must ﬁrst be subtracted
from the ﬂare-time images. This ensures the isolation
of complexity within the microﬂare itself, rather than
just characterization of a spatial diﬀerence between ﬂare
emission and (generally lower energy) emission from the
surrounding active region.

Suitable quiet times for background subtraction were
found for only two events (16:44-16:45 UT for may1618,
shown in Figure 7; 18:12-18:15 UT for may1747), as
essentially no quiet times occurred during the August
2017 observation (see Figure 1), and the remaining May
2018 microﬂares were faint enough that background sub-
traction resulted in poor statistics and signiﬁcant non-
physical distortion. After background subtraction, the
NuSTAR emission centroid was computed in the 2-4, 4-
6, and >6 keV energy ranges for each FPM, considering
all pixels with values above 15% of the maximum pixel
value in each raw (not deconvolved) image. Diﬀerences
in centroid between the two FPM in the full NuSTAR
energy range (all energies >2 keV) were used as an esti-
mate of uncertainty in the centroid measurements. Nei-
ther of the events displayed a diﬀerence between emis-
sion centroids in diﬀerent NuSTAR energy ranges larger
than the estimated uncertainty. This is consistent with
what is observed in AIA Fe XVIII, where both of these
events showed dominant emission from just one feature.

5. SPECTROSCOPY

Spectroscopy of the NuSTAR microﬂares was per-
formed using the XSPEC spectral ﬁtting software (Ar-
naud 1996). Data from NuSTAR’s two telescopes
and their corresponding focal plane modules (FPMA,
FPMB) were ﬁt simultaneously using the Cash statistic
(CSTAT) as a ﬁt statistic, which better handles low-
count data (Cash 1979).

The same stable, single-CHU-combination time inter-
vals described in Section 4 were used for spectroscopy in
10/11 microﬂares. As previously noted, NuSTAR point-
ing was reconstructed using several diﬀerent CHU com-
binations during event aug1850. However, large pointing
shifts were not associated with the CHU changes during
the ﬁrst three minutes (rise/peak) of the microﬂare. Be-
cause of this, aug1850 spectroscopy was performed using
data from all component CHU combinations over that
interval.

Though the NuSTAR energy range is typically cited as
3-79 keV, the instrument is capable of observation down
to 2 keV. However, diﬀering pixel thresholds complicate
the response at the very low end of the energy range,
and spectroscopy below 2.5 keV is not recommended
(Grefenstette et al. 2016). As a conservative approach,

11

a lower energy bound of 3 keV was employed for spec-
troscopy in this analysis. The upper bound of the ﬁt en-
ergy range was set to be 10 keV (for fainter events with
little to no emission above that energy) or 12 keV for the
brightest events (aug1850, aug1900, aug1918, may1618,
may1747). The NuSTAR spectra were binned to have a
minimum of 10 counts in each energy bin.

For each ﬂaring interval, the eﬀects of pileup were es-
timated by examining the incidence of multiple-pixel
events with geometries that cannot be explained by
charge-sharing between pixels for a single photon (see
Appendix C of Grefenstette et al. (2016)). Pile-up was
found to be negligible in all events. Additionally, it is
noted that when a pile-up correction was performed for
the brightest microﬂare considered here (aug1850) in an
earlier study (Glesener et al. 2020), it resulted in changes
to spectral parameters small enough to be consistent
within their uncertainties (Glesener, personal commu-
nication). Because of this, no pile-up correction was
performed for the microﬂares examined here.

While the events considered in this study are small
in magnitude compared to the population of ﬂares ob-
served by RHESSI and other previous solar observato-
ries, they also include the brightest ﬂares yet observed
with NuSTAR under optimal observing conditions. Be-
cause of this, analysis of these events led to the ﬁrst
identiﬁcation of variations in the NuSTAR gain in the
extremely low-livetime (<1%) regime.

This phenomenon is described in detail in Appendix
A, the conclusion of which is a simple correction to the
slope of the linear gain, as well as a set of criteria for
determining whether such a correction is likely to be nec-
essary for a given event. Consideration of such correc-
tions will be standard practice for future NuSTAR mi-
croﬂare studies. Here, gain corrections were performed
for aug1850, aug1900, aug1918, may1618, may1736, and
may1747 with the percent shift in gain slope recorded
in Table 3. In most cases, the gain slope parameter is
tied between the two FPM, with uncertainty in the re-
sulting value deﬁned as the diﬀerence between FPMA
and FPMB gain slope values when the ﬁt is re-run with
the FPMA, FPMB gain slopes untied. The orientation
of the detector chip gap in FPMA over a portion of the
ﬂare site during aug1850 led to signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
ﬂux between the two FPM; because of this, the FPMA
and FPMB gain slope corrections were determined in-
dependently for that event.

Initial spectroscopy used XSPEC’s isothermal vapec
model, which allows
for user-speciﬁed abundances
(taken from Feldman (1992), as is standard practice for
NuSTAR solar spectroscopy (e.g. Wright et al. 2017)).
High energy excess was seen over the single vapec model

FPMB (red) count spectra are shown in each upper panel, while the lower panels show the error-normalized residuals. For
may1606 (one of the faintest microﬂares), spectral ﬁts were performed between 3-10 keV. The vapec+vapec model provides the
strongest ﬁt to the data. The signiﬁcantly brighter aug1900 was ﬁt over 3-12 keV, and required a gain correction (see Appendix
A). The slope of the linear gain was freed while performing the vapec+vapec ﬁt, and its resulting value (0.990) was applied as
a ﬁxed correction for the vapec and vapec+bknpwr ﬁts. For this event, the vapec+vapec and vapec+bknpwr ﬁts were similar in
quality. Thermal ﬁt parameters for both events are reported in Table 3, and vapec+bknpwr parameters are reported for aug1900
in Table 4.

in all eleven events. The origin of this excess was hy-
pothesized to be either emission from smaller volumes
of higher temperature plasma likely produced at or near
the reconnection site, or nonthermal emission from ﬂare-
accelerated electrons. To investigate these possibilities,
a second isothermal model was added (vapec+vapec),
and a separate ﬁt was also performed using an isother-
mal model in conjunction with a nonthermal broken
power law (vapec+bknpwr). For the bknpwr model com-
ponent, the spectral index below the break energy was
ﬁxed to 2 for all events, as it was expected that the
thermal component would dominate at lower energies.

5.1. Spectral Results

The majority (8/11) of the microﬂares were best ﬁt by
the vapec+vapec model, as determined both by the use
of the CSTAT, as well as manual inspection of residu-
als. This included all May 2018 microﬂares and aug1909.
Example spectra from one of these clearly thermal mi-
croﬂares are shown in Figure 8, displaying all three po-
tential models. The thermal parameters found for these
events are reported in Table 3, which also reports the
estimated thermal energy present in each (the energy
values reported are the sum of the thermal energies of
both component thermal models). Thermal energies of
each component were calculated assuming an isothermal
plasma volume with energy given by,

(3)

[erg]

UT = 3kBT (cid:112)EM f V
where T is the temperature of the plasma, EM the emis-
sion measure, V the volume, and f is a ﬁlling factor
(assumed here to be unity). Diﬀerenced AIA Fe XVIII
images (see Section 4) were used to estimate a volume
for each event by considering the geometries of the Fe
XVIII loops deemed most likely to be associated with
the NuSTAR emission, and converting from the result-
ing area, A, to a volume (by taking A3/2). These vol-
umes were additionally used to calculate the density
of the thermal plasma in each microﬂare. Densities
are also reported in Table 3, along with the estimated
background-subtracted observed GOES class, and the
expected GOES class calculated from the NuSTAR T
and EM using the goes flux49.pro IDL routine. The
goes flux49.pro routine calls CHIANTI version 7.1,
and was set to assume coronal abundances (Dere et al.
1997; Landi et al. 2013).

For two more microﬂares (aug1900, aug1918), the
vapec+vapec models were still unable to fully account
for some of the highest energy emission (>8 keV - see
Figure 8 for spectra from aug1900). For both of these
events, the vapec+bknpwr models did slightly better at
higher energies, but found the break energy of the bro-

ken power law distribution to occur between 6-7 keV,
near the strong Fe complex centered around 6.7 keV.
This weakened the case for the vapec+bknpwr model,
because at least some of its success could be attributed
to the beneﬁt of a break in the spectrum placed near
where the thermal continuum is broken by the presence
of that Fe complex.

For these two events, it cannot be deﬁnitively shown
that a nonthermal component is present. Perhaps the
high-energy excess above the vapec+vapec ﬁt is the re-
sult of a multi-thermal plasma more complex than that
which can be well-represented by only two isothermal
models. To characterize the ﬂare plasma suggested by
the thermal interpretation, the vapec+vapec parame-
ters and thermal energies for these events are reported
in Table 3.

For the last event (aug1850), the vapec+vapec ﬁt
failed to arrive at a result involving physically realistic
plasma temperatures (the higher-temperature found was
∼4×109 K). In this case, the observed NuSTAR spec-
trum was clearly best ﬁt by the vapec+bknpwr model,
as was also found in Glesener et al. (2020). The energy
content in nonthermal electrons was calculated by de-
termining the nonthermal power from the bknpwr model
parameters (assuming a thick target model, as described
in Brown (1971)), and then integrating over the mi-
croﬂare rise times.

The resulting nonthermal energy is reported in Table
4, along with the vapec+bknpwr model parameters and
observed/calculated GOES classes. The vapec compo-
nent of the vapec+bknpwr model is also shown in Table
3, where it has been used to estimate a thermal en-
ergy content and loop density. The resulting thermal
and nonthermal parameters, energies, and density were
seen to be qualitatively similar to the results of Glesener
et al. (2020), though not entirely consistent within un-
certainties. The inconsistency is attributed to a slightly
diﬀerent energy range for spectral ﬁtting (3-12 keV here,
versus 2.5-12.9 keV) and a modiﬁed gain correction pro-
cedure (see Appendix A).

6. DISCUSSION

6.1. Assessment of ‘Large Flare’ Properties in

NuSTAR Microﬂares

In this section, these NuSTAR microﬂares are con-
sidered with respect to four ‘large ﬂare’ properties: (1)
impulsivity in all HXR energies, (2) earlier peak times
in higher-energy emission, (3) greater impulsivity in
higher-energy emission, and (4) spatial complexity. The
temporal evolution of these microﬂares show generally
good agreement with the ﬁrst two of these properties. As
shown in Section 3.2, the majority of the events (8/11)

displayed an impulsive time proﬁle in all NuSTAR en-
ergy ranges considered, and all events were either im-
pulsive or at least consistent with an impulsive proﬁle
within uncertainty in the 2-4, 4-6, and 6-8 keV energy
ranges. Additionally, 10/11 events (all but may1917,
the faintest microﬂare) display a trend toward earlier
peak times in higher-energy NuSTAR emission. Both
of these results provide evidence that the same energy
release processes that drive much brighter events may
also be at work at the microﬂare scale.

The third ‘large ﬂare’ property– greater impulsivity
in higher-energy emission– was not observed. However,
comparison of impulsivity across energy ranges is com-
plicated by NuSTAR’s livetime limitations. Extemely
low livetime at microﬂaring times (combined with pro-
portionally much greater observed ﬂux in the lower end
of the NuSTAR energy range) limits the spectral dy-
namic range (Grefenstette et al. 2016), meaning that
higher energy time proﬁles have poorer statistics and
greater uncertainties in the event asymmetry index (see
Table 1). Thus, the failure to conﬁrm this relationship is
not seen as proof that it does not exist for these events.
Examination of this property in HXR ﬂares at this scale
likely requires an HXR instrument with sensitivity sim-
ilar to NuSTAR that is optimized for the high ﬂux as-
sociated with solar observation.

Spatial complexity in HXR emission (the fourth prop-
erty considered) is a standard feature of larger ﬂares,
and has also been observed in some RHESSI A- and
B- class microﬂares (e.g. Hannah et al. 2011). Diﬀer-
ential centroid locations between diﬀering HXR energy
ranges could result from either a thermal plasma with
a spatial gradient in temperature, or distinct thermal
and nonthermal HXR sources. Of these eleven events,
there were two microﬂares for which background sub-
traction could be performed to isolate ﬂare-speciﬁc emis-
sion from that of the larger, cooler surrounding active
region. These both originated from the same set of loops
in AR 12712, and neither displayed diﬀerences in the
centroids of emission in diﬀerent energy ranges outside
our range of uncertainty. This could imply the observa-
tion of emission from co-spatial thermal components, or,
in the non-thermal interpretation, a situation in which
loop-top ﬂare-accelerated electrons are thermalized be-
fore reaching loop footpoints (as was concluded in Gle-
sener et al. (2020)). A similar lack of spatial complexity
was also seen in the NuSTAR microﬂare examined in
Glesener et al. (2017), while, contrastingly, FOXSI HXR
microﬂare emission was shown to be spatially complex
in Vievering (2019). Further studies involving a greater
number of HXR microﬂares of A-class and below are
necessary to determine the relative incidence of these

Figure 9. NuSTAR microﬂares from this study (pink cir-
cles) are shown in context with other NuSTAR microﬂares
(black triangles), as well as FOXSI (stars) and RHESSI
(red) events (aug1850 is included as a pink triangle, to indi-
cate that it is both previously published and a part of this
analysis). The vertical axis shows ﬂux at 5 keV (a measure
of intensity), while the horizontal shows the ratio of ﬂux at
8 and 3 keV (a temperature analogue), with reference lines
corresponding to constant EM. This allows for a comparison
of ﬂaring events that is agnostic to any particular spectral
model, and shows a strong correlation between these two
quantities in the included solar brightenings. A linear ﬁt to
the thermal NuSTAR microﬂares from this paper (excluding
aug1850) as well as one additional NuSTAR thermal ﬂare
(Glesener et al. 2017) is shown in blue.

two contrasting results, and also to investigate if they
are connected to other microﬂare properties.

6.2. Thermal vs. Nonthermal Interpretation

As described in Section 5.1, the majority (8/11) of
the microﬂares were found to be best ﬁt by a double
thermal model, and the brightest event (aug1850) was
found to be best ﬁt by a single thermal model combined
with a nonthermal broken power law distribution. The
other two (aug1900, aug1918) were similarly well-ﬁt by
both double thermal and thermal + broken power law
models.

To further explore a nonthermal

interpretation in
those two events, nonthermal energies were calculated
from their best ﬁt broken power law model components,
assuming a thick target model (Brown 1971). These en-
ergies are reported in Table 4 along with the thermal and
broken power law model parameters. The nonthermal
energies found are around an order of magnitude larger
than derived thermal energies (Table 3). This suggests
that, while there is not suﬃcient spectral evidence to
prove the presence of a nonthermal electron distribution

in these events, the spectra are consistent with a non-
thermal source that could power the observed thermal
emission.

Figure 9 shows a brightness vs. hardness diagram,
which includes these eleven microﬂares in context with
previous NuSTAR, FOXSI and RHESSI events. This
representation displays trends in HXR spectral shape
across the ﬂares, regardless of their multithermal or non-
thermal natures. As discussed in Section 3.3, spectral
hardness (deﬁned here as the ratio of ﬂuxes at two HXR
energies in the continuum) provides a measure of tem-
perature if the ﬂares are isothermal. This parametriza-

tion allows for inclusion of multithermal and nonthermal
ﬂares in the visualization. The vertical axis is a measure
of intensity at an energy covered by all the instruments
in question. For reference, lines of constant EM for an
isothermal plasma are overplotted.

Additionally, a blue line shows a linear ﬁt to all of
the thermal NuSTAR ﬂares with signiﬁcant counts at 8
keV (excluding the nonthermal aug1850). These are the
brighter events observed; see spectral models and ref-
erences for all published NuSTAR microﬂares in Table
5, where events included in this ﬁt are highlighted. De-
spite not being included in the ﬁt calculation, aug1850

lies close to this line, conﬁrming that its spectral shape
is not at all unusual when compared to the other ﬂares.
This hints that the smaller ﬂares may also have nonther-
mal aspects that are more challenging to disentangle. In
particular, aug1900 is noted as a particularly compelling
suspect for a hidden nonthermal component, as it not
only showed ambiguity between nonthermal and ther-
mal spectral models, but also occurred immediately af-
ter aug1850, and from the same set of ﬂare loops within
the larger active region (see Figure 7; Figure 2 in Gle-
sener et al. (2020)).

7. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have considered eleven NuSTAR
microﬂares, ten of which are new to the literature, in
order to broaden understanding of the properties of
HXR ﬂares at this scale. Consideration of these events
together with previous studies (Glesener et al. 2017;
Wright et al. 2017; Hannah et al. 2019) begins to es-
tablish a picture of a ‘standard’ low-A-class HXR mi-
croﬂare. These events commonly display impulsive time
proﬁles, with higher HXR energies peaking before lower
energy HXRs (and before peaks in lower-energy instru-
ments). Their spectra are dominantly thermal, with
ﬂare plasma distributions well-approximated by a com-
bination of a brighter, cooler, plasma volume (T=3-5
MK) with a fainter, hotter one (T=5-10 MK).

While the presence of nonthermal emission cannot
be deﬁnitively established in the majority of cases (the

17

nonthermal behavior of the brightest event (aug1850)
remains a singular occurrence among microﬂares ob-
served so far), the spectra of some of the larger events
(aug1900, aug1918) are consistent with a picture involv-
ing a nonthermal energy source. Therefore, it seems that
the range of magnitudes in peak HXR ﬂux spanned by
the microﬂares observed by NuSTAR so far includes the
transition between a regime where nonthermal emission
is dominant, and one where it is largely indistinguish-
able from thermal emission. Further exploration of non-
thermal properties in HXR events of similar brightness
is needed to characterize this transition, which is noted
as an especially crucial regime for developing an under-
standing of particle acceleration at the smallest scales.
Such exploration will begin with future NuSTAR mi-
croﬂare observations, but will require a solar-dedicated
focusing HXR instrument to be approached in a statis-
tical manner.

A. GAIN CORRECTIONS

For several of the brighter microﬂares (may1618, may1736, may1747, aug1900, aug1918), initial spectroscopy using
vapec models resulted in features in ﬁt residuals that indicated a systematic failure of these models to accurately ﬁt
the NuSTAR spectrum. Speciﬁcally, double thermal vapec+vapec models struggled to accurately locate two emission
line features present above the thermal continuum (see Figure 10, Left).

From the CHIANTI atomic database, we expect lines in this energy range observed from hot ﬂaring plasma to be
a Ca line at ∼3.9 keV (Ca XIX), as well as a complex of lines from transitions in highly-ionized Fe centered around
6.7 keV (the Fe XXV resonance line, along with a collection of Fe XXIV satellites) (Dere et al. 1997; Del Zanna
et al. 2015). When supplied with coronal abundances, the vapec models should be able to accurately represent these
features, which are well-understood components of emission from solar plasma at coronal temperatures.

The entire catalogue of observed NuSTAR microﬂares were re-examined in XSPEC, using a constructed ﬁt designed
to examine the handling of these emission lines: a sum of two continuum-only thermal models (nlapec) with two
ﬁxed-width gaussians to simulate line features. The expected 6.7 keV Fe complex was not found in any NuSTAR
microﬂare with suﬃcient higher-energy statistics to well-locate a line in that energy range; in every case, the line
feature observed above 6 keV was found to be shifted lower in energy (often to around 6.4 keV, a diﬀerence far greater
than the stated ∼40 eV systematic uncertainty in the NuSTAR gain (Madsen et al. 2015)).

This includes several events for which simultaneous co-spatial emission in the AIA 131 ˚A channel indicates the
presence of plasma at temperatures expected to produce the Fe complex. Even in an accidentally-observed decaying

Figure 10. Two double thermal (vapec+vapec) ﬁts are shown to the spectrum of microﬂare may1618 (16:18–16:24 UTC).
Livetime-corrected FPMA (black) and FPMB (red) count spectra are shown in each top panel, while the lower panels show
the error-normalized residuals. In the left example, the vapec+vapec ﬁt struggles to account for line features between 3-4 and
6-7 keV (clearly seen in residuals). In the right example, the vapec+vapec ﬁt has been repeated with the gain slope parameter
freed. Signiﬁcant improvement is seen in the handling of both emission lines with a small change in gain slope (<3%).

X-class ﬂare (observed at a GOES ∼C-class level by NuSTAR, (Grefenstette et al. 2016), and well-observed by
RHESSI ), the higher energy NuSTAR emission is found to be inconsistent with a 6.7 keV line.

In order to explain these changes in line energy as the result of doppler shifts, the emitting thermal plasma would
need to be traveling toward the Sun at a speed (∼10,000 km s-1) that is over an order of magnitude larger (and in the
wrong direction) than plasma velocities observed in either coronal mass ejections or upward-moving plasma volumes
associated with chromospheric evaporation (Gosling et al. 1976; Antonucci et al. 1984).

The possibility of the actual observation of an emission line around 6.4 keV was explored, as 6.39–6.4 keV Fe Kα
emission has been historically observed in M- and X-class ﬂares by high-resolution spectrometers (interpreted as ﬂare-
driven collisional- or photo-ionization of neutral Fe in the photosphere, Emslie et al. 1986). This feature has never
been identiﬁed in an event anywhere close to as faint as these A-class microﬂares, but the limited spectral resolution
(∼1 keV, Lin et al. 2002) of RHESSI and limited sensitivity of other instruments means that such an observation has
likely never previously been possible. However, the Fe Kα explanation for the unexpected incidence of a line at 6.4
keV does not resolve the issue of the failure to observe the 6.7 keV complex even in ﬂares where AIA and RHESSI
context imply it should be observed. Additionally, microﬂare-driven photospheric Fe ionization would require a photon
or nonthermal electron ﬂux that we do not observe.

An investigation was conducted to determine if this discrepancy could be resolved by adding a correction to the
NuSTAR gain. XSPEC allows for ﬁtting of response parameters, speciﬁcally the ﬁtting of slope and intercept (oﬀset)
parameters describing a linear representation of the gain. Response ﬁtting was performed using standard vapec+vapec
models, where both response and model parameters were allowed to vary simultaneously.

With variation of under 5% in the value of the gain slope only (with no change to the oﬀset), the vapec+vapec
model was able to achieve a dramatically better ﬁt to the NuSTAR spectrum and resolve the line location discrepancy
in every event where it was seen. An example is shown in Figure 10, where the addition of only one more parameter
(freed gain slope) to the ﬁt allows dramatic improvement in the handling of both observed line features. This event is
representative of results in all cases where the line location discrepancy was identiﬁed.

The eﬃcacy of this correction across multiple events has led to the conclusion that a small artiﬁcial shift in the
NuSTAR gain is the most likely explanation for the consistently identiﬁed discrepancies in solar spectral lines. A 5%
gain shift is inconsistent with observations taken in “standard” astrophysical observations where the sources produce
moderate count rates (<1000 cps) and high livetime. See, for example, the joint observation of the neutral Fe Kα
complex in Cen A (F¨urst et al. 2016). This would also result in a ∼4 keV shift of the 86.54 keV 155-Eu calibration line,
which is not observed (Grefenstette 2015). We therefore conclude that the extreme count rates (>105 cps) and the
resulting low-livetimes (<1%) present in many observations of solar active regions and microﬂares result in a reduced

gain of the readout electronics. Such an eﬀect has previously been suggested for the NuSTAR detectors (Bhalerao
2012), but until now has not been observed in any astrophysical sources.

The nature of this problem limits the circumstances in which it can be deﬁnitively identiﬁed: without any signiﬁcant
line features, the continuum thermal spectrum of a plasma volume with a small gain shift added is indistinguishable
from the spectrum of a plasma volume possessing slightly diﬀerent temperature and emission measure.
It is only
when a line is noticeable above the continuum that a gain discrepancy can be readily observed and quantiﬁed by its
displacement. For NuSTAR solar observations so far, this has so far occurred only in a livetime regime of ∼1% or
below.

The following procedure is prescribed for investigating possible gain shifts when considering low-livetime NuSTAR
solar specta, and correcting for them if they are identiﬁed. It will be considered a standard aspect of NuSTAR solar
spectroscopy moving forward:

• For events with a line between 6-7 keV that can be located to an energy lower than the expected 6.7 keV, a gain
correction should be found by performing a standard vapec+vapec ﬁt with the gain slope parameter freed.

• The resulting correction to the gain slope should be applied as a ﬁxed correction for spectral ﬁtting with other
model combinations. This is recommended even when vapec+vapec does not give the best ﬁt, as a line location
discrepancy can be most accurately identiﬁed and corrected for when assuming thermal models only.

• For events with no noticeable line features (or, in the event that a visible line is present with no discrepancy
between its expected and observed location), the application of a gain correction is not recommended. If a gain
correction is applied, it should be understood that improvement in ﬁt does not, on its own, imply the necessity
of a correction. Uncertainty ranges for ﬁt parameters should be therefore be extended to include their values
when no correction is applied.

In events where a correction is deemed necessary (six of the microﬂares presented here, as well as other yet-
unpublished events), the application of gain corrections according to this method has not been seen to have a dramatic
eﬀect on ﬁt parameters. For the six events in this paper, the largest changes in the best ﬁt parameters were 10% in
temperature and 40% in emission measure2. All NuSTAR microﬂare studies published prior to the identiﬁcation of
this issue have been examined to see if gain corrections should be applied retroactively, and none were found to ﬁt the
criteria established here. Therefore, it is not expected that any possible gain discrepancy would have aﬀected those
scientiﬁc results.

It is noted that the previous paper considering microﬂare aug1850 (Glesener et al. 2020) was completed at a time
when the gain discrepancy had been identiﬁed, but before this standardized procedure had been established. As such,
the gain correction applied in that work was performed by freeing the gain slope during a vapec+bknpwr ﬁt, rather
than by the method described here. The qualitative agreement in spectral results for aug1850 between that paper and
this one show that this diﬀerence does not aﬀect the earlier conclusions regarding that microﬂare.
