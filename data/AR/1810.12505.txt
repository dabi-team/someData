Abstract A solar active region (AR) that produces at least one M- or X-class
major ﬂare tends to produce multiple ﬂares during its passage across the solar
disk. It will be interesting if we can estimate how ﬂare-productive a given major
ﬂaring AR is for a time interval of several days, by investigating time series of its
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld properties. For this, we studied 93 major ﬂaring ARs
observed from 2010 to 2016 by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). More speciﬁcally, for each
AR under study, the mean and ﬂuctuation were calculated from an 8-day time
series of each of 18 photospheric magnetic parameters extracted from the Space-
weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP) vector magnetogram products at
12-min cadence. We then compared these with the AR’s 8-day ﬂare index, which
is deﬁned as the sum of soft X-ray peak ﬂuxes of ﬂares produced in the AR
during the same interval of the 8-day SHARP parameter time series. As a result,
it is found that the 8-day ﬂare index is well correlated with the mean and/or
ﬂuctuation values of some magnetic parameters (with correlation coeﬃcients
of 0.6–0.7 in log-log space). Interestingly, the 8-day ﬂare index shows a slightly
better correlation with the ﬂuctuation than the mean for the SHARP parameters
associated with the surface integral of photospheric magnetic free energy density.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂares suddenly release a huge amount of energy mainly in the form of
electromagnetic radiation and high-energy particles. Consequently, ﬂares occa-
sionally cause rapid, signiﬁcant variations in the near-Earth space environment
called space weather (e.g., Handzo, Forbes, and Reinisch, 2014; Hayes et al.,
2017). There have been several reports that (severe) space weather events re-
lated to major ﬂares aﬀect space assets and also harm human health, such as
malfunction of satellites, radiation exposure of astronauts/aircrews/passengers,
interruption of radio communication, and so on (e.g., Baker, 2005; Schrijver
et al., 2014; Lugaz, 2015; Ponomarchuk et al., 2015). Various eﬀorts are therefore
being made to establish a reliable system for operational ﬂare prediction to
eﬀectively prevent various types of damage from powerful ﬂare events. (e.g.,
refer to Barnes et al., 2016, and several ﬂare forecasting methods therein)

In order to understand energy build-up and triggering processes of ﬂares in
solar active regions (ARs), it is very important to investigate three-dimensional
AR magnetic ﬁeld structures and their evolution. However, direct measurement
of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld has been scarcely carried out, so that photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld data have been mainly used to study various AR magnetic ﬁeld
properties in relation to ﬂares (e.g., refer to Leka and Barnes, 2003, and refer-
ences therein). For example, Moore, Hagyard, and Davis (1987) studied the shear
angle (i.e., the angular deviation of the observed transverse magnetic ﬁeld from
the potential transverse ﬁeld) along the magnetic polarity inversion lines (PILs)
in three diﬀerent ARs, and they found that the three large ﬂares under investi-
gation occurred in extended PIL regions with large magnetic shear. Measuring
the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux around strong-gradient PILs of ARs (called
log R or R_VALUE), Schrijver (2007) found that the larger R_VALUE an AR
has, the higher chance it produces a ﬂare within the next 24 hours following the
R_VALUE measurement. Leka and Barnes (2007) carried out some statistical
tests based on linear discriminant analysis with numerous magnetic parameters
derived from ∼1200 photospheric vector magnetograms of 496 diﬀerent ARs.
They found that the best-performing discriminant functions, resulting from
combining three or more photospheric magnetic parameters, make a slight im-
provement to distinguish between ﬂaring and ﬂare-quiet ARs. Recently, several
machine-learning algorithms, such as support vector machine and multilayer
perception, have been applied to various AR photospheric magnetic parameters
in order to improve the performance of ﬂare prediction (e.g., Ahmed et al., 2013;
Bobra and Couvidat, 2015; Liu et al., 2017; Sadykov and Kosovichev, 2017).

An AR producing at least one M- or X-class major ﬂare, called a major ﬂaring
AR, in general consists of several, large sunspots with strong magnetic ﬁelds, and

SOLA: ms.tex; 31 October 2018; 0:28; p. 2

Flare Productivity and Magnetic Properties of Flaring Active Regions

it often has a complicated magnetic ﬁeld structure which may evolve dynamically
in the form of rotation, shear motion or ﬂux emergence/cancellation (e.g., Zhang
et al., 2001; Park et al., 2008; Min and Chae, 2009; Toriumi et al., 2014; Zhao
et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2016). Major ﬂaring ARs tend to produce multiple
ﬂares of diﬀerent sizes, typically accompanied with high-speed and geoeﬀective
CMEs, during its solar disk passage (e.g., Yashiro et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2009).
There have been few studies to understand how long-term (i.e., several days)
ﬂare productivity of major ﬂaring ARs is related to properties and evolution of
their photospheric magnetic ﬁeld. Abramenko and Yurchyshyn (2010) examined
power spectra calculated from line-of-sight magnetograms of 217 ﬂaring ARs that
produced at least one ﬂare of any GOES class. They found that a steeper mag-
netic power spectrum is shown in ARs with higher ﬂare productivity during their
solar disk passage. Note that the power spectrum of each AR is calculated from
the AR’s magnetogram observed at a single point in time of its passage near the
solar disk center. Welsch et al. (2009) determined several time-averaged magnetic
and ﬂow ﬁeld parameters calculated from ∼3–5-day time series of line-of-sight
magnetograms of 46 ARs. Comparing the parameters to ﬂare productivity of the
ARs during the same time interval of the investigated magnetogram time series,
they found that in general the larger the value of some parameters an AR has,
the higher ﬂare-productive it is. Note that among the 46 ARs, only 11 of them
are major ﬂaring ones.

In the present study, we investigate ﬂare productivity of major ﬂaring ARs
in relation to their photospheric magnetic ﬁeld properties with the following
important diﬀerences compared to previous studies. (1) We investigate a large
number of major ﬂaring ARs, i.e., 93 diﬀerent NOAA-numbered ARs with at
least one M- or X-class ﬂare, observed between August 2010 and February 2016.
(2) We examine 8-day time series of various parameters derived from AR pho-
tospheric vector magnetograms at 12-min cadence. (3) The time series data is
parameterized with the mean and ﬂuctuation. (4) We study how the mean or
ﬂuctuation is correlated with ﬂare productivity during the same interval (i.e., 8
days) of the time series. (5) We discuss how the correlation varies if we use an
initial portion of the time series to calculate the mean and ﬂuctuation, but the
same 8-day ﬂare productivity.

2. Data and Analysis

The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al., 2012) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell, Thompson, and Chamberlin, 2012)
provides full-disk, photospheric vector magnetograms with a spatial resolution of
0.5 arcsec per pixel and temporal resolution of 12 minutes. In this study, we use
18 magnetic parameters stored as keywords in “hmi.sharp_cea_720s series” of
Space-weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP; Bobra et al., 2014) data
products. The parameters are derived for each automatically-identiﬁed HMI
AR patch (called HARP) using its corresponding photospheric vector mag-
netogram which is deprojected to the heliographic coordinates with a Lam-
bert (cylindrical equal area; CEA) projection method. The SHARP parame-

Lee et al.

ters generally characterize the identiﬁed AR’s strong-magnetic-ﬁeld area, un-
signed magnetic ﬂux in the entire region or around PILs, magnetic ﬁeld incli-
nation/gradient/shear/twist, current density, current helicity, and magnetic free
(excess) energy (Leka and Barnes, 2003; Schrijver, 2007; Bobra et al., 2014;
Bobra and Couvidat, 2015). There have been attempts to predict ﬂares and
coronal mass ejections using the SHARP parameters (Bobra and Couvidat, 2015;
Bobra and Ilonidis, 2016). Refer to Table 1 for the details of the 18 SHARP
parameters.

The noise level in the HMI observables shows large-scale spatial variations
over the entire solar disk due irregular characteristics of the HMI instrument
(Couvidat et al., 2016). Hoeksema et al. (2014) reported that the number of high-
conﬁdence pixels, during the disk passage of HARP 2920, decreases signiﬁcantly
as the HARP moves away from a region, hereafter Θ60, within ∼60◦ from the
central meridian. We therefore use the SHARP parameters here, only if they
are calculated from an HARP of which center position is within Θ60. For our
data set, we aimed to include a large number of major ﬂaring ARs in order to
study the relationship between their long-term ﬂare productivity and various
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld properties (i.e., the SHARP parameters). Over the
period of HMI observations from August 2010 to February 2016, we searched
ARs that: (1) consistently appeared with a well-developed structure within Θ60
so that their associated SHARP data are available, and (2) produced at least
one M- or X-class ﬂare during their passage within Θ60. As a result, we found a
total of 93 diﬀerent NOAA-numbered, major ﬂaring ARs.

For each of the 93 major ﬂaring ARs under study, we analyze a set of time
series of the 18 SHARP parameters at 12-min cadence over ∼8 days of its passage
within Θ60. For all the examined ARs, a time series X of a given, single SHARP
parameter consists of a total of 960 data points at 12-min cadence in the selected
8-day interval: i.e., X = [X1, X2, X3, . . . , X960]. If there is however a missing value
in the 8-day time series, then it is ﬁlled with a Not-a-Number (NaN) representing
an undeﬁned or unrepresentable value in numeric calculations such as the mean
and standard deviation. For the time series X, we ﬁrst calculate the mean as

¯X =

1
N

960

X
i=1

Xi,

(1)

where the summation is done excluding NaNs if they exist in X and N is the
number of all data points except NaNs. There are three SHARP parameters
which are signed quantities: i.e., the mean vertical current density MEANJZD,
the mean characteristic twist parameter MEANALP, and the mean vertical
current helicity MEANJZH. For these signed parameters, note that we use
of the mean of their X for the comparison with 8-day
the absolute value
ﬂare productivity of the ARs under study during their disk passage within Θ60.
Note that the SHARP parameters are calculated from only pixels that are (1)
within the smooth bounding curve (i.e., BITMAP ≥ 33) of the HARP rectangular
bounding box and (2) above the high-conﬁdence disambiguation threshold (i.e.,
CONF_DISAMBIG=90). The number of the pixels contributing to the SHARP
parameter calculation varies with location on the disk and velocity of SDO

relative to the Sun (Hoeksema et al., 2014) so that systematic errors, including
the center-to-limb variation and the 12-hour periodicity, are embedded in X.
It is expected that some systematic errors may be reduced by averaging the
parameter values in X.

Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) is a technique to investigate long-range
dependence and statistical self-similarity in both stationary and non-stationary
time series (e.g., Peng et al., 1994, 1995; Hu et al., 2001; Király and Jánosi,
2005). It can be also applied to estimate the characteristic size of ﬂuctuation
from the cumulative and detrended time series of measurements, such as X,
consisting of a time-varying signal with random noise and/or a systematic error.
This detrended ﬂuctuation primarily captures apparently random variations in
X by diminishing variations which are relatively more persistent and/or more
systematic. Such random variations in X might be important for self-organized-
criticality (SOC) models of ﬂares, in which the corona reaches a critical state
and is driven to ﬂare by random motions of photospheric footpoints of coronal
loops (e.g., Lu and Hamilton, 1991; Charbonneau et al., 2001). The detrended
ﬂuctuation of X in this study is determined as follows. First, the cumulative
sum, Y = [Y1, Y2, Y3, . . . , Y960], is calculated from a sequence of X − ¯X as

Yk =

Xi − ¯X

.

(2)

Next, the time series Y is divided into non-overlapping segments of equal length
n, and for each segment a local least squares straight-line ﬁt ˜Y(n) (i.e., a local
linear trend) is calculated. The detrended ﬂuctuation ˜F(n) is then deﬁned as the
root-mean-square deviation of Y with respect to the local trend ˜Y(n), i.e.,

˜F(n) =

(3)

˜F(n) is one of quantitative measures that can be used to estimate the overall
degree of variation in time series data X, including short-term and long-term
ﬂuctuations as well as linear and non-linear trends but eliminating the local linear
trend ˜Y(n) in the cumulative sum Y. We calculated ˜F(n) with a set of diﬀerent
values of n, i.e., n=[4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120], and found that the
correlation of ˜F(n) with the 8-day ﬂare productivity is only weakly sensitive to n.
In this study, ˜Y is calculated with n=120 (i.e., 24-hr, non-overlapping intervals)
in order to reduce any contamination in ˜F(n) due to the SDO’s orbital signal.
Hereafter, by ﬂuctuation ˜F, we refer to the detrended ﬂuctuation using n=120,
i.e., ˜F(120).

Figure 1a presents an example of the time series X of the absolute value of the
net vertical current helicity ABSNJZH for HARP 5011, from 31 December 2014
to 8 January 2015. The 12-hour periodicity appears in X, which is due to the
spacecraft orbital velocity relative to the Sun. The mean value ¯X is marked with
the horizontal red line in Fig. 1a. The cumulative sum Y is shown in Fig. 1b,
and the local least squares best-ﬁt line ˜Y (red) for each segment of n=120 is

overplotted with Y (black) in Fig. 1c. The deviation from the local trend, i.e.,
Yi − ˜Yi, is plotted in Fig. 1d. We can see the 12-hour periodicity is somewhat
reduced in the time proﬁle of the deviation.

To quantify the 8-day ﬂare productivity of each AR under our study, we deﬁne
8-day ﬂare index (hereafter shortly indicated as I8d) as the sum of GOES soft
X-ray peak ﬂuxes of ﬂares produced in the AR during the same interval of the
AR’s 8-day SHARP parameter time series data, i.e.,

I8d = 100 × S(X) + 10 × S(M) + 1 × S(C),

AR during the 8-day interval, and ξ(j)
is the magnitude (i.e., digit multipliers
from 1.0 to 9.9) of the j-class ﬂares. Note that I8d measures the AR’s total ﬂare
productivity during the 8-day interval, and it is diﬀerent from the daily ﬂare
index which is, in our case, I8d divided by the time interval 8 days used for
counting ﬂares in the AR (e.g., Antalova, 1996; Abramenko, 2005).

3. Results

This section is divided into three parts. In Section 3.1, we present the relationship
between the mean ¯X of the SHARP parameter time series and the 8-day ﬂare
index I8d for the 93 major ﬂaring ARs under investigation. In Section 3.2, we
describe how the detrended ﬂuctuation measurement ˜F is correlated with I8d.
In Section 3.3, we discuss how the relation of I8d to ¯X or ˜F varies if we use an
initial portion of the time series for calculation of ¯X and ˜F.

3.1. Flare Index versus Mean of SHARP Time Series

We examine the relationship between I8d and ¯X for the 93 major ﬂaring ARs.
Figure 2 shows I8d versus ¯X, in log-log space, calculated from the following
SHARP parameter time series: (a) the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux USFLUX,
(b) the total unsigned vertical current TOTUSJZ, (c) the total unsigned vertical
current helicity TOTUSJH, (d) the absolute value of the net vertical current
helicity ABSNJZH, (e) the sum of the absolute value of the net current per
polarity SAVNCPP, (f) the surface integral of photospheric magnetic free en-
ergy density TOTPOT, (g) R_VALUE, (h) the mean gradient of the total ﬁeld
strength MEANGBT, and (i) the mean vertical current density MEANJZD. The
9 SHARP parameters shown in Figure 2 are selected among a total of the 18
parameters for the following reasons: ﬁrst, USFLUX is considered as reference,
and then the others for which ¯X or ˜F has a better correlation with I8d, compared
to that of USFLUX. The Spearman’s rank-order correlation coeﬃcient (SCC)
is derived from the log-log scatter plot of I8d against ¯X, and it is marked in
each panel of Figure 2 with a 95% conﬁdence interval using the Fisher’s Z-
transformation. Note that the SCCs are statistically signiﬁcant with p-values less
than 0.05. In addition, for a given SHARP parameter, we estimate uncertainties
in ¯X as follows: (i) ¯X is calculated for each AR, from a set of 100 diﬀerent time

SOLA: ms.tex; 31 October 2018; 0:28; p. 6

Flare Productivity and Magnetic Properties of Flaring Active Regions

series of the SHARP parameter values in which measurement errors are added;
(ii) the uncertainty in ¯X for each AR is then deﬁned as the standard deviation
of 100 values of ¯X determined in the previous step (i). The uncertainties are
marked in each panel of Figure 2.

First, in the case of USFLUX, we ﬁnd that for the examined major ﬂaring
ARs with the larger ¯X of USFLUX, their 8-day ﬂare productivity tends to be
generally higher (SCC=0.52). Note that USFLUX is a well-known parameter
that has a moderately good correlation with the occurrence rate and magnitude
of solar eruptive events such as ﬂares and CMEs (e.g., Falconer, Moore, and
Gary, 2002; Tian, Liu, and Wang, 2002; Leka and Barnes, 2003, 2007), and it has
been frequently used as a reference for the evaluation of any ﬂare-prediction pa-
rameter (e.g., Park, Chae, and Wang, 2010; Kontogiannis et al., 2017). A better
correlation (SCCs of 0.57–0.72) is also found in the parameters that characterize
the AR’s strong-gradient PILs, current helicity, current and magnetic free energy
(i.e., R_VALUE, TOTUSJH, SAVNCPP, ABSNJZH, TOTUSJZ and TOTPOT,
in the order of a higher SCC). Interestingly, these parameters, which have a
higher SCC than USFLUX, are calculated from a sum of a physical quantity
over an entire AR surface or an extended PIL region (i.e., extensive parameters).
This is in agreement with previous studies based on AR photospheric magnetic
parameters (e.g., Welsch et al., 2009; Bobra and Couvidat, 2015).

It is also found that I8d is weakly anticorrelated with ¯X of the intensive
SHARP parameters MEANGBT and MEANJZD (SCCs of -0.26 and -0.27,
respectively). Note that MEANJZD only has both positive and negative values
(i.e., a signed parameter) among the 9 SHARP parameters. Because the mean of
the absolute values of MEANJZD during the interval of the entire time series is a
measure of the AR’s average current imbalance, we further check the relationship
of I8d with the mean value of the unsigned time series of MEANJZD: as a result,
a moderate anticorrelation (SCC=-0.46) is found. The anticorrelation between
I8d and ¯X of either signed or unsigned MEANJZD may in part be explained
from the fact that ¯X of signed or unsigned MEANJZD is anticorrelated with
¯X of USFLUX (i.e., SCC of -0.27 or -0.52, respectively). It seems currents in
the examined ARs are fairly neutralized. In that case, the sum of signed values
of the vertical current density in the AR’s entire photospheric surface may not
diﬀer signiﬁcantly between the ARs of diﬀerent sizes so that MEANJZD will be
in inverse proportion to the size of the ARs. In the case of MEANGBT, the anti-
correlation may be inferred as follows. Unlike the vertical magnetic ﬁeld Bz, the
total ﬁeld strength Bt does not change its sign across PILs. Thus, MEANGBT
will be relatively small in the case of an AR with a highly ﬂare-productive delta
sunspot because the strong-ﬁeld, opposite magnetic polarities are located very
close to each other so that the horizontal gradients of Bt around the AR’s PIL will
be very small. On the other hand, in the case of a less ﬂare-productive AR with
widely separated sunspots, the gradients of Bt can have relatively large values
at the sunspot boundaries. An anticorrelation (SCC=-0.49) between ¯X values of
MEANGBT and R_VALUE can support the inference mentioned above.

In addition, we investigate whether the correlation between I8d and ¯X is better
than that between I8d and any randomly selected, single data point in the time
series X. For this, a Monte Carlo test is carried out with the time series data of

SOLA: ms.tex; 31 October 2018; 0:28; p. 7

Lee et al.

the 9 SHARP parameters shown in Figure 2, as follows: (1) for each of the 93
ARs in the data set, we randomly select a single value from X, (2) we calculate
the SCC between I8d and the randomly selected values, (3) repeating the above
two procedures 100 times, we calculate the average of the SCCs. We ﬁnd that in
general I8d is slightly better correlated with ¯X than the randomly selected data
point at a single point in time (i.e., SCCs are 0.02–0.12 higher). In particular, for
the best-correlated parameter, R_VALUE, the SCC from the log-log plot of I8d
vs. ¯X is 0.72, while that of I8d vs. randomly selected data points is 0.61. Refer to
the right two columns in Table 2 for the SCCs calculated from the log-log plots
of I8d vs. ¯X and I8d vs. randomly selected values, respectively, for all of the 9
SHARP parameters.

For the SHARP parameters of which ¯X has a meaningful correlation with I8d,
it is important to understand the degree to which a selected SHARP parameter
is related to I8d, independent of another parameter. We therefore calculate the
Pearson partial correlation coeﬃcient between I8d and ¯X of one selected among
the top 7 most strongly correlated parameters in Figure 2 while removing the
eﬀect of another well-correlated SHARP parameter. As a result, it is found
that the partial correlation coeﬃcients between I8d and ¯X of the best-correlated
parameter R_VALUE are in the range of 0.36–0.55 in log-log space, which are
still meaningful despite eliminating the eﬀect of one of the other parameters.

3.2. Flare Index versus Fluctuation of SHARP Time Series

The relationship between I8d and ˜F is also examined for the 93 major ﬂaring
ARs under investigation. Figure 3 shows I8d as a function of ˜F, in log-log space,
determined from the time series of the same SHARP parameters shown in Fig-
ure 2. SCCs are marked in Figure 3, and all of them are statistically signiﬁcant
with p-values less than 0.05. The uncertainties in ˜F for each AR, determined in
the same way described in Section 3.1, are shown in each panel of Figure 3. For
the 9 SHARP parameters, we ﬁnd that SCCs between I8d and ˜F are in general
similar or slightly lower than those between I8d and ¯X. However, the best SCC
of 0.62 is found from the log-log scatter plot of I8d vs. ˜F of the surface integral
of photospheric magnetic free energy density TOTPOT, which is much larger
than the SCC of 0.32 from that of I8d vs. ˜F of USFLUX. We also ﬁnd that I8d
shows a negative correlation with ˜F of the mean vertical current density MEAN-
JZD (SCC=-0.54) or the mean gradient of the total ﬁeld strength MEANGBT
(SCC=-0.41), respectively. This result suggests that more ﬂare-productive ARs
show less ﬂuctuation of MEANJZD and MEANGBT during the time interval of
8 days. To understand the importance of each of the 9 SHARP parameters in
relation to I8d, as in Section 3.1, the Pearson partial correlation coeﬃcients are
calculated between I8d and ˜F. It is found that the partial correlation coeﬃcients
between I8d and the best-correlated ﬂuctuation parameter TOTPOT are in the
range of 0.23–0.59 in log-log space; i.e., the highest partial correlation is obtained
with ˜F of USFLUX as a control variable, while the lowest with ˜F of R_VALUE.
In addition, in the case that ˜F of USFLUX is used as a control variable, the
partial correlation coeﬃcients remain more or less the same or slightly decrease
for most of the parameters, compared to the Pearson correlation coeﬃcients in
log-log space without removing the eﬀect of ˜F of USFLUX.

Flare Productivity and Magnetic Properties of Flaring Active Regions

It is worthwhile to check whether/how ˜F is related to ¯X to understand the
temporal variation of the SHARP parameters in relation to ﬂare activity. We
expect ﬂuctuation in X of a given SHARP parameter to be on the same scale
as values in X of the SHARP parameter, suggesting that values of ˜F will be
large or small when values of ¯X are large or small, respectively. We therefore
expect ˜F and ¯X to be signiﬁcantly correlated, independent of whether or not ¯X
is associated ﬂare activity. Figure 4 shows log-log plots of ˜F vs. ¯X calculated from
the 93 major ﬂaring ARs for the same SHARP parameters shown in Figures 2
and 3. The color of each AR data point (marked as a circle) indicates the AR’s
I8d. From the log-log plots, we ﬁnd that in general ¯X and ˜F are well correlated
with each other in log-log space (SCCs of 0.66–0.89) even though there is a
relatively weak correlation in the case of MEANJZD (SCC=0.40). This suggests
that the larger ¯X an AR has for a given magnetic parameter, the larger ˜F of the
parameter it may show during a long-term interval of several days. Investigating
the correlations between ¯X of USFLUX and ˜F of the SHARP parameters, we
notice that ¯X of USFLUX shows a positive correlation (SCCs of 0.47–0.73) with
˜F of some parameters which are positively correlated with I8d, while it shows a
negative correlation with ˜F of MEANGBT (SCC=-0.63) or MEANJZD (SCC=-
0.70) which is anticorrelated with I8d. It is also found that I8d tends to be large
in the case of an AR which has small values of both ¯X and ˜F for MEANGBT
and MEANJZD and/or large values for the other parameters.

As explained in Section 2, ˜F is a measure of the degree of variation in a
given SHARP parameter time series X, including not only ﬂuctuations but
also linear/non-linear trends. It is deﬁned as the root-mean-square deviation
of the cumulative sum with respect to its local trend (i.e., a linear ﬁt). The
standard deviation σ of X can be also used to quantify the amount of variation or
dispersion of X. We examine how the relationship between I8d and ˜F is diﬀerent
from that between I8d and σ. SCCs are calculated from the log-log plots of I8d
vs. σ for the 9 SHARP parameters. We ﬁnd that I8d is slightly better correlated
with ˜F than σ for most of the parameters. There are a few parameters (e.g.,
USFLUX and MEANJZD) of which σ has a little higher SCC with I8d than ˜F;
MEANJZD typically does not show a relatively long-term variation pattern in
their time series. Refer to the right two columns in Table 3 for the SCCs of I8d
vs. ˜F and I8d vs. σ, respectively, for the 9 SHARP parameters.

To account for the expected scaling of ˜F with ¯X, we investigate how normaliz-
ing ˜F by the scale of ¯X aﬀects its relationship with I8d as well as with ¯X. For this,
˜F is divided by σ of X, which indicates the ratio of the detrended ﬂuctuation
to σ. We ﬁrst check how the rescaled ﬂuctuation parameter ˜F/σ is correlated
with ¯X of USFLUX as a reference for the size of ARs. A weak anticorrelation is
found between ˜F/σ and ¯X of USFLUX for all the SHARP parameters (SCCs of
-0.03 to -0.24) in Figure 3 excluding SAVNCPP (SCC=0.03). This may suggest
that smaller ARs tend to exhibit greater fractional changes in the parameter
values. We also examine the correlation between I8d and ˜F/σ for the 9 SHARP
parameters; however, a very weak anticorrelation is found between them (SCCs
of -0.04 to -0.20) except MEANJZD (SCC=0.11). Because ARs with large values
of USFLUX and/or magnetic parameters are not only more ﬂare-productive but
they also evolve more dynamically over time, it is reasonable to expect that I8d
is moderately well correlated with ¯X or ˜F but only weakly correlated with ˜F/σ.

3.3. Various Time Intervals for Calculation of Mean and Fluctuation

Lee et al.

We examine how the correlation between I8d and ¯X as well as between I8d and
˜F varies depending on the time interval used for calculation of ¯X and ˜F. SCCs
are calculated from the log-log plots of I8d vs. ¯X and I8d vs. ˜F, of which ¯X and ˜F
are calculated from some diﬀerent initial portions of the SHARP parameter time
series as follows: X1d = [X1, X2, X3, . . . , X120], X2d = [X1, X2, X3, . . . , X240], . . .,
and X8d = [X1, X2, X3, . . . , X960]. Note that if high SCCs can be found between
I8d and ¯X or between I8d and ˜F from an initial portion of the time series, then it
may help us to estimate a long-term (several days) ﬂare productivity of a given
AR only taking into account the measurement of the SHARP parameters for the
ﬁrst few days of the AR’s disk passage.

First, as shown in Table 2, the SCCs between I8d and ¯X generally increase
as a longer time interval is considered: i.e., using a larger portion of the time
series tends to improve the correlation. R_VALUE shows the best correlation
with I8d in all the diﬀerent intervals. It is also interesting that the correlation
between I8d and ¯X, calculated from the time intervals of the ﬁrst few days in
X, is slightly worse than that between I8d and a randomly selected single data
point in X, for most of the 9 SHARP parameters except the poorly anticorrelated
parameters MEANJZD and MEANGBT. We speculate this is due to the fact
that ¯X calculated from the early, short-term phase of X may not represent the
magnetic ﬁeld properties of the major ﬂaring ARs which in general dynamically
evolve during their 8-day disk passage.

With respect to ˜F, a similar increasing trend of the SCCs between I8d and
˜F, as found between I8d and ¯X, is also found as the time interval considered for
calculation of ˜F gets longer. Refer to Table 3 for the details of the SCCs for the 9
SHARP parameters. I8d shows the highest correlation (SCCs of 0.51–0.65 with ˜F
of the photospheric magnetic free energy density parameter TOTPOT for all the
intervals except for the 2-day interval). We also ﬁnd that a relatively high SCC
of 0.61 can be obtained between I8d and ˜F of the best-correlated parameter
TOTPOT calculated from the 4-day interval (i.e., using the half of the time
series), compared to that (SCC=0.62) calculated from the 8-day interval.

4. Summary and Discussions

In this study, we have investigated the relationship of the long-term (i.e., 8-day)
ﬂare index I8d with the mean ¯X or detrended ﬂuctuation ˜F calculated from 8-day
time series of 18 photospheric magnetic parameters (called SHARP parameters)
for 93 major ﬂaring ARs. Our ﬁndings can be summarized as follows:

(i) A meaningful correlation is found between I8d and ¯X as well as between I8d
and ˜F with SCCs of ∼0.6–0.7 for some SHARP parameters. In the case of ¯X,
I8d shows its best correlation with the PIL-related parameter R_VALUE
(SCC=0.72), while with ˜F of the surface integral of magnetic free energy
density TOTPOT (SCC=0.62). For many of the SHARP parameters, the
SCCs between I8d and ¯X are slightly higher than those between I8d and ˜F.

Flare Productivity and Magnetic Properties of Flaring Active Regions

(ii) Using only an initial portion (e.g., ﬁrst 4 days) of 8-day time series of some
SHARP parameters, a similar correlation of I8d with ¯X or with ˜F can be
obtained as found in (i) using the entire time series.

Several studies have been carried out to ﬁnd out photospheric magnetic
parameters which can be used to understand ﬂare productivity of ARs, in par-
ticular, with respect to ﬂare occurrence in the next short-term (e.g., 24-hr)
interval following the parameter measurement. For example, the total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux parameter USFLUX, which is one of the most frequently examined
parameters and measures the size of ARs, shows that it has a moderately good
correlation with soft X-ray ﬂare index of ARs (e.g., Abramenko and Yurchyshyn,
2010), as well as a somewhat ﬂare-predictive capability (e.g., Leka and Barnes,
2007; Park, Chae, and Wang, 2010; Kontogiannis et al., 2017). In addition,
compared to USFLUX, similarly good or (slightly) better ﬂare-predictive pa-
rameters were reported, such as the mean photospheric magnetic free energy
density proxy MEANPOT (e.g., Yang et al., 2012, 2013), the total unsigned
vertical current TOTUSJZ (e.g., Leka and Barnes, 2007) and the total unsigned
vertical current helicity TOTUSJH (e.g., Bobra and Couvidat, 2015). As al-
ready reported in those previous studies, we also found that ¯X of USFLUX
shows a moderately good correlation with the long-term ﬂare productivity (i.e.,
I8d). Moreover, ¯X of some parameters that quantitatively measure the AR’s
morphological complexity, non-potentiality or magnetic free energy shows a
relatively better correlation than USFLUX. An even more remarkable ﬁnding
is that ˜F of those non-potentiality-associated parameters shows a comparably
good correlation with the ﬂare productivity. Here we report this for the ﬁrst
time examining the SHARP parameter time series of the 93 major ﬂaring ARs.
It is however not clear how ˜F is related to the AR’s ﬂaring activity. We speculate
that short-term (tens minutes to a few hours), large variations of some SHARP
magnetic parameters under study, indicated by ˜F, may (partly) represent how
unstable the AR’s magnetic system is and/or whether a ﬂare will be triggered
in relation to a rapid change or increase of twists, currents, and so on. ˜F also
captures random variations in X, and these ﬂuctuations may be relevant for
the evolution of an AR into a critical state in which a small perturbation can
trigger a ﬂare, as suggested by SOC models (e.g., refer to Aschwanden, 2012,
and references therein). However, the fact that ˜F is not much more signiﬁcant
for ﬂaring than ¯X may suggest that the corona may not be predominantly driven
to ﬂare by random magnetic evolution at the photosphere, as would be expected
based upon SOC models. On the other hand, ˜F may measure some changes in
the AR’s magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration and associated currents in the course of a
ﬂare and its corresponding eruption, if any (e.g., Wang et al., 2012; Wang, Liu,
and Wang, 2012; Petrie, 2013; Janvier et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014).

The results from this study suggest that for a given AR, examining its ¯X and
˜F from time series with a few days of multiple photospheric (vector) magnetic
parameters, we may be able to estimate the AR’s long-term ﬂare productivity.
Further studies on SHARP parameter time series data, using the same analysis of
¯X and ˜F but with an extended data set including less ﬂare-productive ARs (e.g.,
ARs that produce C-class ﬂares only), will help us to understand whether the

Lee et al.

same relation of the long-term ﬂare index with ¯X or ˜F still exists or not. In the
case of ﬂare-quiet ARs, it will be also interesting to check whether there is any
threshold-like value of ¯X or ˜F for some SHARP parameters between ﬂaring and
ﬂare-quiet ARs. Furthermore, a diﬀerent parameterization of SHARP parameter
time series, such as linear trends (increase or decrease), can be applied to ﬁnd any
characteristic variation in magnetic parameters before major ﬂares. We expect
these kinds of parameter-based studies will improve our understanding of which
AR magnetic parameter(s) can provide some useful information regarding the
ﬂare energy build-up and triggering processes.

Figure 1. An example of calculating the mean ¯X and the detrended ﬂuctuation ˜F. Panels
show (a) the 8-day time series X (black line) of one of the SHARP parameters under study,
i.e., the absolute value of the net vertical current helicity ABSNJZH in HARP 5011 and its ¯X
(horizontal line), (b) the cumulative sum Y of X, (c) the local least squares straight-line ﬁt
˜Y for each segment of equal length n=120 (red line) on Y (black line), and (d) the deviation
from the local trend, i.e., Y − ˜Y. ˜F is deﬁned as the root-mean-square of Y − ˜Y. The start
times of all major ﬂares (M1.0 above), produced in the HARP during the interval of X, are
marked in the panel a with vertical red lines. Note that there are two missing data points in
X which are ﬁlled with Not-a-Number (NaN) values.

Figure 2. Log-log scatter plots of the ﬂare index I8d vs. the mean ¯X calculated from 8-day
time series of 9 SHARP parameters for 93 major ﬂaring ARs. The Spearman’s rank-order
correlation coeﬃcient (SCC) and its 95% conﬁdence interval are denoted in each panel. The
uncertainty in calculating ¯X for each AR is also marked with an error bar, but note that in
many cases the range of error bars is smaller than the size of data points (shown by circles).
