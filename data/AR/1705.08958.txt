Abstract: We calibrate a two-phase xenon detector at 0.27 keV in the charge channel and at 2.8 keV
in both the light and charge channels using an 37Ar source that is directly released into the detector.
We map the light and charge yields as a function of electric drift ﬁeld. For the 2.8 keV peak, we
calculate the Thomas-Imel box parameter for recombination and determine its dependence on drift
ﬁeld. For the same peak, we achieve an energy resolution, Eσ/Emean, between 9.8% and 10.8%
for 0.1 kV/cm to 2 kV/cm electric drift ﬁelds.

The two-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) has become a leading detector technology for
weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) [1–3], axion, and axion-like particle (ALP) searches
[4, 5]. These detectors are also employed to detect coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering from
nuclear reactors, spallation sources, and supernova neutrinos [6–10]. Two-phase xenon TPCs are
currently being explored for use in neutrinoless double beta decay, neutrino magnetic moment
searches [11, 12], and Compton imaging of gamma rays [13].

The understanding of the charge and light signals in liquid xenon has developed substantially in
the last few decades. The details of the mechanisms that generate the detectable signal are reviewed
in [14, 15].

When a particle interacts with xenon, it deposits its energy either as an electron recoil (ER)
or a nuclear recoil (NR). The kinetic energy of the incoming particle results in some combination
of excited xenon atoms, ionized xenon atoms, and heat. An excited atom pairs with a ground-state
neighbor to form an excited dimer. An ionized atom can recombine with an electron, resulting
similarly in an excited atom that forms a dimer. When the dimer de-excites, it gives oﬀ scintillation
light with a wavelength of 178 nm. This is the S1 signal, also referred to as the “prompt" scintillation.
A second scintillation signal, called S2 or “proportional" scintillation, is created by the remaining
electrons, which are drifted through the liquid to the surface by an electric ﬁeld. They are extracted
into the gaseous xenon by a stronger electric ﬁeld. In the gas, the electrons interact with the gaseous
atoms to create the second scintillation signal.

The fraction of xenon ions that recombine (r) aﬀects both the number of photons produced
(nγ = Nex + Nir), which is related to the S1 signal, and the number of electrons produced (ne =
Ni(1 − r)), which is related to the S2 signal. Nex and Ni are the number of initially excited and
ionized atoms. The recombination fraction can then be expressed as

r =

Thomas and Imel model the rate at which the number of electrons and xenon ions change
after the initial particle-xenon interaction with diﬀusion equations and include a term to represent
recombination [16]. Using properties of electron and xenon ion diﬀusion in xenon, they simplify
these equations and apply a boundary condition that the electron-ion pairs are isolated and uniformly
distributed in a box of dimension a. They derive

to describe the recombination fraction, where α is a constant related to electron and ion mobility
and ν is the mean ionized electron speed.

Understanding xenon’s response in the below-10 keV regime is vitally important for quantifying
the sensitivity of large scale dark matter detectors (such as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), XENON1T, and
PandaX) to lower mass WIMPs [17–19]. Nuclear and electron recoils can be diﬀerentiated by
their S2/S1 ratios, because ERs generally have a higher S2/S1 ratio than NRs for the same S1 area.
Electron recoils that have a diminished S2/S1 ratio cannot be distinguished from nuclear recoils.
Therefore, examining low-energy ERs will allow for a better understanding of discrimination at
low energy between diﬀerent types of recoils, and thus improve detector sensitivity to lower-energy
WIMPs through background reduction.

Recently, papers such as [20] and [21] have discussed the possibility of detecting sub-GeV
WIMPs in two-phase xenon TPCs using the low-energy ER signal from the bremsstrahlung radiation
produced from a WIMP interacting inelastically with a xenon nucleus. Additionally, understanding
this low-energy regime will quantify the sensitivity of two-phase xenon detectors to axions, ALPs,
and the neutrino magnetic moment. All of these are expected to produce low-energy ERs [4, 5, 12].
There is previous work studying the response of noble two-phase detectors to 37Ar, a source
of mono-energetic, low-energy ER events. Sangiorgio et al. studied 37Ar in a two-phase argon
detector [22]. They measured the charge yield of both the 0.27 keV and 2.8 keV peaks at a drift
ﬁeld of 2.4 kV/cm, as well as the ratio of the two peaks. Akimov et al. studied several isotopes,
including 37Ar, in a small, two-phase xenon detector [23]. They measured the charge yield for the
2.8 keV peak at 3.75 kV/cm. In this work, we present the eﬀects of systematically varying electric
drift ﬁeld on the charge and light yield for 37Ar events in a two-phase xenon TPC.

PIXeY Detector

PIXeY (Particle Identiﬁcation in Xenon at Yale) is a hexagonal, two-phase xenon detector that was
designed to measure the scintillation and ionization response of xenon as a function of drift ﬁeld.
Figure 1 shows a cross section of PIXeY. The potential diﬀerence between the cathode grid and
the gate grid (5.05 cm apart) forms the drift ﬁeld and the potential diﬀerence between the gate grid
and the anode grid (0.74 cm apart) forms the extraction ﬁeld. The detector is 18.4 cm in width at
its widest point. Although the detector holds approximately 12 kg of xenon, only 2 kg are included
in the ﬁducial volume. The ﬁducial volume consists of a cylinder in the middle of the active liquid
xenon. The diameter of this cylinder is 13 cm, in order to avoid the edge eﬀects of the drift ﬁeld.

– 2 –

A drift time cut of 3 to 30 µs is applied in order to reduce backgrounds from the PMT array and
electrodes. PIXeY was designed such that a strong electric ﬁeld, up to 13.5 kV/cm, can be applied
to the extraction region in order to ensure nearly 100% electron extraction eﬃciency. A wide range
of voltages can be applied to the cathode, creating drift ﬁelds between 0.05 and 2 kV/cm. In this
experiment, the extraction ﬁeld is 1.9 kV/cm and the drift ﬁeld is varied between 0.1 and 2 kV/cm. In
[24], the electron extraction eﬃciency was measured to be 78 ± 5 %. The light collection eﬃciency,
g1, in PIXeY was calculated to be 9.7 ± 7 %, using a technique similar to [25]. However, instead
of using several calibration sources with diﬀerent energies at one drift ﬁeld, one calibration source
(83mKr) was used at several diﬀerent drift ﬁelds.

Figure 1. Cutaway rendering of the PIXeY TPC.

The S1 and S2 signals are detected by two arrays of seven Hamamatsu R8778 photomultiplier
tubes (PMTs) on the top and bottom of the TPC. The data acquisition (DAQ) system used a low-pass
ﬁlter to trigger preferentially on small S2 pulses without triggering on every single photoelectron.
The signal acquired from the PMTs undergoes an eight-fold ampliﬁcation before it is digitized with
a 12-bit ADC (CAEN V1720) at 250 MHz.

37Ar Source

37Ar decays via electron capture (EC) according to the decay reaction

37Ar →37 Cl + νe

(3.1)

and releases x-rays from the capture of the K-shell, L-shell, and M-shell electrons at 2.8224 keV,
0.2702 keV, and 0.0175 keV with branching ratios of 0.90, 0.09, and 0.009 [26]. These x-rays are
photoabsorbed in the xenon bulk producing an electron recoil.

37Ar can be produced through reaction 3.2a [29, 30], reaction 3.2b [31, 32], or reaction 3.2c

[26, 33, 34, 36].

In this work, reaction 3.2c was used because it can be conveniently performed in a lab setting
without a nuclear reactor, unlike reaction 3.2a, or a high-energy proton beam, unlike reaction 3.2b.
An americium-beryllium (AmBe) source with 106 neutrons/s ﬂuence was used to irradiate the
calcium. The cross section of this reaction peaks at approximately 200 mb for 5-6 MeV neutrons
[34]. An AmBe source produces neutrons with energy up to 11 MeV [35]. It is possible to simply
irradiate calcium powder, in the form of CaO, and 37Ar will evolve from the solid material; however,
Abdurashitov et al., showed that argon does not begin to evolve until the powder is heated above
700 ◦C [36]. To avoid high-temperature baking, CaCl2 was dissolved in water. Some of the 37Ar
atoms produced in the solution through irradiation end up in the gas above the solution. Several
purifying steps were necessary, because after irradiation the 37Ar is mixed with air and water vapor.
The ﬁnal 37Ar source needed to be free of oxygen and nitrogen to avoid degrading the PMT response
when introduced to the TPC.

Before the CaCl2 solution was irradiated, the solution was degassed through a series of three
freeze-pump-thaw (FPT) cycles. During the pump step of each cycle, the pressure of the gas volume
above the ice was reduced to 10−3 Torr. The container was irradiated by the AmBe source for 21
days. Both the AmBe source and the container were inside a 7 cm thick polyethylene cup. After
irradiation, the solution container was attached to the puriﬁcation system shown in ﬁgure 2. The
solution container and cold trap 1 (CT1) were placed in frozen ethanol baths (-116 ◦C) to freeze
most of the water vapor. After several hours in equilibrium with CT1, the gas was introduced to
the titanium sublimation pump, which consisted of a Gamma Vacuum PN360682 Titanium Fila-
ment kit inside a conﬂat container [37]. The Ti ﬁlament received repeated current pulses of 48
A, producing a layer of chemically active Ti on the inside walls of the conﬂat container. Non-
noble impurities were eﬃciently removed by the Ti surface. Finally, the 37Ar was cryopumped
into a charcoal-ﬁlled 37Ar storage region, cold trap 2 (CT2), which was submerged in a liquid
nitrogen bath. CT2 was double valved on each side, removed from the puriﬁcation setup, and at-
tached into the PIXeY circulation system. In order to release the source into the detector, xenon gas
was diverted through the charcoal trap before entering the detector, mixing 37Ar with the xenon ﬂow.

4 Results

Two Bq of 37Ar were introduced into the detector, and data were taken at six drift ﬁelds: 0.099, 0.198,
0.396, 0.693, 0.990, and 1.980 kV/cm. For every data set, each recorded waveform was digitized
and scanned by a pulse ﬁnding algorithm. Events containing zero or one S1 pulses and one S2
pulse were selected. The S1 and S2 areas in photoelectrons (phe) were determined by integrating
the corresponding pulses, converting from ADC level-samples to electrons per photoelectron, and
dividing by the average PMT single photoelectron response, 2.65 × 106 electrons per photoelectron.
Several data quality selection cuts were applied to the events. A cut was applied to ensure that
the S1 and S2 pulses contained the majority of the waveform’s total pulse area. Another cut, based
on pulse width, rejected events with large S1 pulses from gamma rays.

The quantity log10( S2

S1 ) is used to discriminate between electron and nuclear recoils. The ±1σ
curves that contain the majority of the ER events is referred to as the electron recoil band, and it
is positioned above the nuclear recoil band in this discrimination space. In order to ensure that
analyzed events were in the ER band, a selection on log10( S2
S1 ) was enforced. S1 and S2 spectra of
the selected data are shown in ﬁgure 3.

peak is ﬁtted with a Gaussian function. For both top and bottom sets of spectra the red (bottom) spectra is at
0.099 kV/cm, the blue (middle) is at 0.693 kV/cm, and the green (top) is at 1.98 kV/cm.

The S1 spectra exhibit a single peak, interpreted as the K-shell 37Ar peak at 2.8 keV. Since this
peak is on the order of single photoelectrons, one would expect the peak to be Poissonian. However,
broadening of this peak was observed due to the non-uniform light collection and gain dispersion.
Therefore a Poisson function was convolved with a Gaussian function and ﬁt to the S1 spectra. For
each k number of events, the area of a Gaussian was set equal to the Poisson probability that those

centered at k, is

The DAQ trigger threshold prevented eﬃcient measurement of small S1 pulses. For this reason,
only the data between S1 = 6 phe and S1 = 15 phe were used to ﬁt Eq. 4.1. To approximate the
trigger eﬃciency, the value of the convolved Poisson function was divided by the data for each bin in
the histogram and a logistic function was ﬁt to the resulting points. The logistic function across all
ﬁelds was similar: the S1 at which the logistic function reaches 50% ranges from 2.97 to 3.20 phe.
The solid curves in ﬁgure 3 are the convolved Poisson function ﬁtted for each ﬁeld multiplied by
the logistic threshold function averaged across all ﬁelds, while the dashed curves show just the
convolved Poisson function.

The light yield, measured in number of photons per keV, was computed from the S1 spectra.
Because the convolved Poisson function was only ﬁt on part of the peak, a one-dimensional χ2
minimization was performed on the convolved Poisson multiplied by the logistic threshold function
by varying the Poisson parameter λ for S1 = 3 phe to S1 = 15 phe. The measured light yield was the
λ derived from this χ2 minimization divided by the two photoelectron correction, 1.175, the light
collection eﬃciency, g1, and 2.8 keV. The two photoelectron correction was measured by [38] and
assumed to be the same for PIXeY, since the same PMTs were used. The statistical uncertainty on
the light yield was calculated from the χ2 minimization and the systematic uncertainty is dominated
by the uncertainty in g1. Figure 4 shows the light yield for diﬀerent drift ﬁelds.

Figure 4. Yields at various ﬁelds for both 37Ar peaks. The red circles show the 2.8 keV light yield. The
purple triangles show the 2.8 keV charge yield. The light purple triangle shows the 2.8 keV charge yield
measured by Akimov et al. [23]. The blue squares show the total quanta for the 2.8 keV peak. The green
pentagons show the charge yield for the 0.27 keV peak. The 0.27 keV charge yield has been oﬀset by 10%
in ﬁeld for clarity. The dashed lines are calculated based on the Thomas-Imel box parameter versus ﬁeld
relationship.

The S1 area for the L-shell 37Ar peak at 0.27 keV is expected to be 0.1-0.2 phe from simulations.

This is well below the DAQ trigger threshold, and therefore cannot be measured by PIXeY.

– 6 –

The S2 spectra show the K-shell and the L-shell 37Ar peaks at 2.8 keV and 0.27 keV respectively.
Because the charge signal is much larger than the light signal, these peaks were ﬁt with a Gaussian
function. The average branching ratio between the peaks across all ﬁelds is 0.128 ± 0.005, which
agrees with the measurement by Sangiorgio et al., 0.116 ± 0.013 [22], although it disagrees with
earlier measurements, 0.103 ± .003 and 0.098 ± 0.003 [27, 28].

At each drift ﬁeld, the charge yield, measured in number of electrons per keV, was calculated
from the S2 spectrum; the mean of the Gaussian ﬁt for each peak was divided by the single electron
area, the electron extraction eﬃciency, and the peak energy. The single electron area was measured
by ﬁtting a Gaussian to the area histogram of small S2-like pulses, a population dominated by single
electrons. The single electron area multiplied by the electron extraction eﬃciency is referred to as
g2, so that S2 = g2ne. The statistical uncertainty on the charge yield is the error from the ﬁtting.
The systematic uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the extraction eﬃciency. The charge
yield as a function of the drift ﬁeld for the 2.8 and 0.27 keV peaks is shown in ﬁgure 4.

A combined energy scale can be constructed from a linear combination of S1 and S2 so as
to optimize the energy resolution, Eσ/Emean. Figure 5 shows the K-shell, 2.8 keV, peak in this
combined energy scale, along with Gaussian ﬁts. Eσ/Emean ranges from 9.8% at 1.98 kV/cm to
10.8% at 0.099 kV/cm.

Figure 5. Combined energy spectra for the 2.8 keV peak at three ﬁelds. Each peak is ﬁtted with a Gaussian
function. The red (bottom) spectra is at 0.099 kV/cm, the blue (middle) is at 0.693 kV/cm, and the green
(top) is at 1.98 kV/cm.

From Eq. 1.1 it can be seen that the fraction of recombination can be calculated using the
measured nγ, ne, and an estimate for Nex/Ni. The quantity Nex/Ni cannot be measured directly,
but it has been calculated by several analyses of two-phase xenon detectors [25, 43, 44]. For this
analysis, Nex/Ni was assumed to be 0.06 in order to match the work of Lin et al. as well as
Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST) [45, 48]. Once r is calculated, the Thomas-Imel box
parameter, 4ξ/Ni, follows from Eqs. 1.2 and 1.3. Figure 6 shows the 4ξ/Ni dependence on ﬁeld.

5 Discussion

We have characterized the ER response of a two-phase xenon detector using two mono-energetic
low-energy peaks from 37Ar decay: the K-shell EC x-ray at 2.8 keV and the L-shell EC x-ray at
0.27 keV. The detector was able to identify the S1 and S2 signals from the K-shell x-ray and S2
signal from the L-shell x-ray for six electric drift ﬁelds.

The charge yields for the 0.27 and 2.8 keV peaks at 0.198 kV/cm agree with the charge yields
for other low-energy points, shown in ﬁgure 7. In LUX, tritiated methane was injected and a band
of charge yield from 1.3 to 18 keV was measured at 0.182 kV/cm [46]. Goetzke et al. measured
the charge yield for a range of energies from a 661.7 keV gamma 137Cs source using the Compton
coincidence technique at 0.19 kV/cm, also shown in ﬁgure 7 [47].

NEST has been developed using a collection of models to explain the light and charge yields
of noble elements [48]. It assumes a constant work function or W value, the energy required to
produce a photon or electron, of 13.7 eV and the Thomas-Imel box model for recombination at low
energies. This paper’s analysis is consistent with NEST’s prediction.

Additionally, if the W value is constant down to 0.2 keV as NEST assumes, one would expect
the total quantum yield (sum of the charge yield and light yield) for the 2.8 and 0.27 keV peaks to
be the same. This analysis was only able to calculate the total quantum yield for the K-shell peak,
which varied between 71.3±3.2 and 73.0±3.1; however, with Nex/Ni = 0.06, the recombination
model predicts a total quantum yield for the L-shell peak between 79.6±4.9 and 83.0±5.1 for the
various drift ﬁelds. Comparing the K-shell peak total quantum yield to the L-shell peak estimated
quantum yield, the total quantum yields are statistically consistent across all drift ﬁelds, given the
uncertainties in g1 and g2. This is consistent with NEST’s assumption of a constant W value.

The energy resolutions calculated from these PIXeY data improve upon the energy resolution

data the function Eσ/Emean · 100% = a/
E + b was ﬁt to energy resolutions for diﬀerent energy
peaks [40–42]. In the LUX analysis, a = 33 ± 0.01 keV−1/2 and b = 0, in the XENON10 analysis,
a = 44.3 keV−1/2 and b = 0, in the MiX analysis, a = 22 keV−1/2 and b = 0.42. Using these ﬁts for
2.8 keV, energy resolutions of 19.7%, 26.5%, and 13.7% are expected from the LUX, XENON10,
and MiX analyses, compared to the values of 9.8% to 10.8% measured here.

We also investigated the relationship of recombination with drift ﬁeld. The LUX tritium data
show that recombination decreases with energy [46]. This PIXeY 37Ar analysis shows results
consistent with that ﬁnding. For the 2.8 keV peak, as the ﬁeld increases the charge yield increases,
indicating that recombination decreases as the ﬁeld increases. However, for the 0.27 keV peak, as
the ﬁeld increases the charge yield stays nearly constant. This indicates that recombination is small
and does not vary substantially with ﬁeld at 0.27 keV. For the K-shell peak, r = 0.288 ± 0.025 and
for the L-shell peak, r = 0.023 ± 0.021, which is consistent with zero.

The calculation of the Thomas-Imel box parameter agrees with an analysis from Lin et al.
The Lin analysis calculates 4ξ/Ni by comparing simulations to data and then ﬁts the relationship
between 4ξ/Ni and ﬁeld to Eq. 4.2 [45]. Lin et al.’s analysis found A = 0.017+0.003
−0.002 and δ = 0.140,
which are similar to the values found in this analysis, A = 0.017 ± 0.002 and δ = 0.130 ± 0.013.
Additionally, the Akimov et al. 2.8 keV charge yield measurement of 47 ± 5.5 electrons/keV at
3.75 kV/cm matches within error bars the measured charge yield ﬁeld dependence shown in ﬁgure
4 [23].
