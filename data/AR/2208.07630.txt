Abstract
The record of impact induced shock-heating in meteorites is an important key for un-
derstanding the collisional history of the solar system. Material strength is important
for impact heating, but the eﬀect of impact angle and impact velocity on shear heating
remains poorly understood. Here, we report three-dimensional oblique impact simula-
tions, which conﬁrm the enhanced heating due to material strength and explore the ef-
fects of impact angle and impact velocity. We ﬁnd that oblique impacts with an impact
angle that is steeper than 45 degree produce a similar amount of heated mass as verti-
cal impacts. On the other hand, grazing impacts produce less heated mass and smaller
heated regions compared to impacts at steeper angles. We derive an empirical formula
of the heated mass, as a function of the impact angle and velocity. This formula can be
used to estimate the impact conditions (velocity and angle) that had occurred and caused
Ar loss in the meteoritic parent bodies. Furthermore, our results indicate that grazing
impacts at higher impact velocities could generate a similar amount of heated material
as vertical impacts at lower velocities. As the heated material produced by grazing im-
pacts has experienced lower pressure than the material heated by vertical impacts, our
results imply that grazing impacts may produce weakly shock-heated meteorites.

Plain Language Summary

Meteorites are extraterrestrial materials that have been delivered to the Earth from
asteroids. The materials in meteorites can record information about their formation and
subsequent evolution. Thus, they are excellent sources of information used to explore
the history of the solar system. One such feature recorded is evidence of shock: high pres-
sures and temperatures caused by collisions between asteroids. Previous work investi-
gating impacts found that material strength is a key factor in determining the amount
of impact heating, especially in low-speed collisions, like those expected to occur in the
main asteroid belt. In this work, we explore various oblique incidence impacts to study
the eﬀects of material strength by using a shock physics model. We conﬁrm that ma-
terial strength plays a key role in oblique impacts, just as in head-on impacts. Our re-
sults show that head-on and 45 degree impacts can generate nearly the same amount of
heated mass in total. However, more oblique impacts with a shallower angle produce less
heated mass than other steeper-angle impacts (i.e., head-on and 45 degree impacts). We
also ﬁnd that low-speed vertical impacts and high-speed grazing impacts can produce
the same amount of material in asteroids that have experienced a given temperature.

1 Introduction

Asteroids may impact other terrestrial bodies at various impact velocities and an-
gles. Current asteroids collide with each other at a mean impact velocity of 5 km/s (Bottke
et al., 1994; Farinella & Davis, 1992), while asteroids hit the Moon and Mars at over 10
km/s (Ivanov, 2001; Yue et al., 2013). We observe the evidence of impacts as craters on
Moon, Mars, and asteroids, even on small-sized bodies, like Ryugu and Bennu (Walsh
et al., 2019; Morota et al., 2020). As asteroids have experienced such collisions over the
history of the solar system, exploring ancient evidence of impacts can reveal the early
collisional history of asteroids (e.g., Sugita et al., 2019). Ejecta produced by impacts on
asteroids sometimes travel to the Earth and are found as meteorites. Shock metamor-
phism in meteorites provides evidence of past impacts on their parent bodies (e.g., Keil
et al., 1994; Scott, 2002). Using shock-induced textures in meteorites, we categorize them
by the degree of shock metamorphism (St¨oﬄer et al., 1991; Scott et al., 1992; Rubin et
al., 1997; St¨oﬄer et al., 2018). When a strong shock propagates in the parent body, it
might lead to the melting of materials. Weak shocks, however, are unable to produce melted
textures; weakly shocked meteorites have experienced shock pressure less than 40 GPa.
Nevertheless, weakly shocked meteorites also show evidence of moderate impact heat-

ing (∼ 700 − 800 ◦C), such as the dehydration of phyllosilicate minerals (Nakamura,
2005; Nakato et al., 2008; Abreu & Bullock, 2013) and the reset of 40Ar-39Ar ages (Bogard,
1995, 2011; Weirich et al., 2012; Cohen, 2013). Thus, studying impact heating is essen-
tial for a better understanding of the solar system.

Oblique impacts are more likely to occur than head-on impacts in the solar sys-
tem (Shoemaker, 1962). The most probable impact angle (θimp) is 45◦. The probabil-
ity of impact occuring with an impact angle between θimp and θimp+dθimp is given as
sin(2θimp)dθimp (Shoemaker, 1962). To understand the nature of oblique impacts, nu-
merical simulations have been performed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH;
e.g., Genda et al., 2012; Monaghan, 1992; Benz & Asphaug, 1994; Jutzi, 2015; Sugiura
et al., 2021; Okamoto et al., 2020; Citron & Stewart, 2022) and grid-based hydrodynamic
codes (CTH, SOVA, iSALE-3D; e.g., Pierazzo & Melosh, 2000b, 2000a; Elbeshausen et
al., 2009; Elbeshausen & W¨unnemann, 2011; Elbeshausen et al., 2013; Davison et al.,
2014; Artemieva & Morgan, 2017; Wakita et al., 2019). Previous work has examined the
crater volume and heated mass (Pierazzo & Melosh, 2000b, 2000a; Elbeshausen et al.,
2009, 2013; Davison et al., 2011, 2014). The volume heated to any given temperature
depends on the impactor diameter, mass, velocity, and angle (Pierazzo & Melosh, 2000a).
Recently, the material strength in the target has been recognized as an additional im-
portant parameter for heating (Quintana et al., 2015; Kurosawa & Genda, 2018; Kuro-
sawa et al., 2021; Wakita & Genda, 2019; Wakita et al., 2019).

As extraterrestrial materials have experienced impacts on their parent asteroids,
impact heating is crucial to understand their record. When we consider the material strength
in rocks, the temperature increase is much higher than previously expected (e.g., Kuro-
sawa & Genda, 2018). Dissipation of the kinetic energy due to plastic deformation in pressure-
strengthened rocks is equivalent to an increase in internal energy, leading to higher tem-
peratures during, and after, decompression. Kurosawa and Genda (2018) conﬁrmed the
post-shock heating due to plastic deformation in head-on impacts using a shock physics
code. Although the following work explored an oblique impact of 45◦ at 5 km/s (Wakita
et al., 2019), impacts at a variety of impact angles and velocities must be explored to
better understand the eﬀects of deformational heating. Davison et al. (2014) showed the
dependence of the heated mass on impact angle, however, the estimated post-shock tem-
perature is based on the peak shock pressure, and ignores enhanced deformational heat-
ing (Kurosawa & Genda, 2018).

Here we perform oblique impact simulations with material strength to examine the

dependence of impact heating on impact velocities and angles. While we vary impact
velocity and angle systematically with the same method as in previous work (Wakita et
al., 2019), we also conduct a companion series of the impacts without material strength.
Simulations without material strength have no deformational heating. Thus, compar-
ison of simulations with and without strength allows us to quantitatively determine the
eﬀect of deformational heating (Kurosawa & Genda, 2018; Wakita et al., 2019). Con-
sidering 1000 K as a reference temperature, which is the temperature for Ar age reset-
ting (following previous work, e.g., Marchi et al., 2013), we provide an empirical rela-
tionship of the heated mass which exceeds that temperature.

2 Methods

We use the iSALE-3D shock physics code (Elbeshausen et al., 2009; Elbeshausen
& W¨unnemann, 2011; Collins et al., 2016), to simulate a spherical impactor striking a
ﬂat-surface target at oblique angles. iSALE-3D uses a solver as described in Hirt et al.
(1974). iSALE-2D is limited to simulating vertical-incidence impacts due to its use of
axial symmetry. Thus, to simulate a range of impact angles, we use the fully three-dimensional
version, iSALE-3D. The results of iSALE-2D and vertical impacts of iSALE-3D have pre-
viously been shown to agree well (e.g., Elbeshausen et al., 2009; Davison et al., 2011, 2014;

Raducan et al., 2022). Note that some examined about crater formation and impact ejecta,
but Davison et al. (2014) compared the impact heating (similar to ours but without the
shear heating). Since material strength is important for studying the eﬀect of impact heat-
ing, we employ a strength model appropriate for rocky materials (see below, Collins et
al., 2004; Melosh et al., 1992; Ivanov et al., 1997). It is well known that porous targets
produce more melt than non-porous targets in iSALE-2D (W¨unnemann et al., 2006; Davi-
son et al., 2010), and a porosity compaction model is implemented into the iSALE-3D
(W¨unnemann et al., 2006; Collins et al., 2011). However, to reduce the parameter space
and compare it with previous work (e.g., Kurosawa & Genda, 2018), we only consider
non-porous materials in this study. Nevertheless, we can apply our results in this study
to well-consolidated rocky materials, such as ordinary chondrites having a porosity less
than 10% (e.g., Flynn et al., 2018; Ostrowski & Bryson, 2019). We assume the impactor
and the target have the same composition of dunite, using the ANEOS equation of state
(Benz et al., 1989). In this work, we model dunite as non-porous with material strength.
Since the dunite has a well-deﬁned equation of state (Benz et al., 1989), it is widely used
to simulate the bodies in the inner solar system (e.g., Davison et al., 2010; Johnson et
al., 2015). It also represents meteoritic material well (ordinary chondrite, Svetsov & Shu-
valov, 2015). Thus, material parameters for dunite without porosity in this work are rep-
resentative of compact bodies in the inner solar system. As previously noted, simulations
without strength are only used to quantify the eﬀects of material strength and are not
meant to represent speciﬁc solar system bodies. For the input parameters, we take the
same values shown in Table S1 of Kurosawa and Genda (2018).

When we simulate impacts with material strength, we use two models to describe

the yield strength of intact and damaged rock; the Lundborg strength model (Lundborg,
1968) and the Drucker-Prager model (Drucker & Prager, 1952), respectively. We com-
bine these two models using a damage parameter D which depends on total plastic strain
(e.g., Collins et al., 2004). D ranges from 0 (intact rocks) to 1 (thoroughly fractured rock).
A damage parameter D is initially set as 0 and damage is accumulated as material de-
forms and accumulates plastic strain according to the damage model of Ivanov et al. (1997).
When the shock pressure exceeds the Hugoniot elastic limit, materials become thoroughly
damaged. We ﬁnd material is completely damaged out to approximately 4 impactor radii
from the point of impact (see also Fig. 5 of Wakita et al. (2019)). The yield strength Y ,
that of intact rock Yi, and that of damaged rock Yd are written as follows,

Y = (1 − D)Yi + DYd,

Yi = Ycoh,i +

µintP

Yd = min(Ycoh + µP, Yi),

where Ycoh,i is the cohesion for intact rock at zero pressure, µint is the coeﬃcient of in-
ternal friction for intact rock, P is the temporal mean pressure, Ylimit is the limiting strength
at high pressure, and µ is the damaged friction coeﬃcient, respectively. To simultane-
ously handle both intact and thoroughly fractured rocks (Equation 1), we use the Lund-
borg model for intact rock (Equation 2) and the Druker-Prager model for the thoroughly
fractured rock (Equation 3), respectively. The damaged friction coeﬃcient µ is one of
the important parameters for impact heating (Kurosawa & Genda, 2018; Wakita & Genda,
2019; Wakita et al., 2019). The dependence of the damaged friction coeﬃcient has been
explored and the smaller value represents the case without material strength (Kurosawa
& Genda, 2018). Following the ﬁducial case in their work, we also adopt µ = 0.6 which
is a typical value pertaining to granular materials made of rocky materials (e.g., Collins
et al., 2004). Note that the limiting strength Ylimit is another inﬂuential parameter (see
also Figure S1 of Kurosawa & Genda, 2018). The limiting strength, also known as the
von-Mises strength, is the maximum strength material can have regardless of conﬁning
pressure. Following Kurosawa and Genda (2018), we use Ylimit of 3.5 GPa in this work.

To examine the dependence of impact heating on impact properties, we vary the
impact velocity (vimp = 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 km/s) and the impact angles (θimp = 15◦, 30◦, 45◦,
60◦, 75◦, 90◦). Note that we measure the impact angles from the target surface, i.e., 90◦
is a vertical impact. We ﬁx a radius of the impactor (Rimp) as 2 km with a resolution
of 0.1 km, which corresponds to 20 cells per projectile radius (CPPR). In this study, we
assume that the size ratio of the impactor to the target is small enough to neglect the
curvature of the target body. A resolution of 20 CPPR is suﬃcient to resolve cumula-
tive heated mass as demonstrated in previous work (see Text S3 and Figure S2 in Wakita
et al., 2019). As the numerical diﬀusion exaggerates the temperature of material near
the contact boundary between the impactor and the target (Kurosawa & Genda, 2018),
we need to omit these artiﬁcial overheated regions from further analysis. In our case, that
region corresponds to 0.3 times of impactor mass (Mimp). Though we count that region
in the results, we do not discuss the results that are less than 0.3 Mimp (see following
sections). We place Lagrangian tracer particles in each cell of a high-resolution zone at
the initial state of simulations. Note that the computational region in iSALE-3D con-
sists of a high-resolution zone and an extension zone. The cell size in the extension zone
is larger than that in the high-resolution zone and increases according to the distance
from the boundary between the high-resolution zone (see also Figure 1 of Davison et al.,
2011). To track the highly heated region (i.e., > 1000 K), we take the number of high-
resolution cells as 220 in horizontal direction (x), 100 in vertical direction (z), and 150
in depth direction (y), respectively. We also note that we horizontally shift the origin
of the impact point according to the impact angle; the origin is located in the middle at
θimp = 90◦ and it is shifted 20 cells in the downrange direction at θimp = 45◦. The to-
tal number of tracer particles is as large as ∼ 2 × 106. The Lagrangian tracers move
through the Eulerian grid tracking the temperature and movement of a parcel of mate-
rial. Note that we neglect radiative and conductive cooling during impact events. These
are less eﬀective than the cooling due to expansion over the timescales considered here
(e.g., Sugita & Schultz, 2002).

3 Results

The heated region depends on the impact obliquity. Figure 1 represents the dis-
tribution of peak temperature (Tpeak) at a time of 5 ts after impact, in a suite of sim-
ulations with material strength and an impact velocity of 5 km/s, where ts is a charac-
teristic time for impactor penetration, ts = 2Rimp/vimp. As shown in the provenance
plots (right panels), the heated area becomes shallower for more oblique impacts (see dashed
lines, which show the Tpeak = 1000 K isotherm). Comparing impacts with and with-
out material strength (Figure 2), we can conﬁrm material strength enhances the tem-
perature increase. This is consistent with previous work (Kurosawa & Genda, 2018; Wakita
et al., 2019). As conﬁrmed in Kurosawa and Genda (2018), more kinetic energy is con-
verted into internal energy in the target with material strength. Since deformational heat-
ing cannot occur in simulations without material strength, we observe such additional
heating only in case with material strength. Most material has reached its peak temper-
ature at 2.5 ts, as the isothermal line of 1000 K indicates (see white dotted line and black
dashed line in Figure 3 (b)). To ensure material has reached its peak temperature we
focus our analysis of peak temperatures reached before 5 ts. Also, we have conﬁrmed that
the cumulative heated mass is similar at 2.5 – 10 ts and does not change signiﬁcantly
after 5 ts (see Figure S5 in Wakita et al., 2019).

To examine the eﬀect of material strength, we compare the cumulative heated mass

in the target with/without material strength (see Figure 4). Note that we consider the
number of the tracer particles for which the peak temperature is beyond a given Tpeak,
and regard their total mass as the cumulative heated mass. As shown in Figure 4 (c) (vimp
= 5 km/s), the heated mass with material strength (right-hand panel) is always larger
than that without material strength (pure hydrodynamic case, left-hand panel) at a given

impact angle. The diﬀerence between the case with/without material strength reaches
a factor of ten at the most. Material strength enhances the impact heating regardless
of θimp. On the other hand, the eﬀect of shear heating for the cumulative heated mass
depends on vimp. For lower impact velocity scenarios (Figure 4 (a) and (b)), our results
show the cumulative heated mass in the target with material strength is ∼10 times larger
than that without material strength. Previous work indicated a combination of the ma-
terial strength and movement of the impactor results in the enhanced heating in the oblique
impacts (Wakita et al., 2019). Since the heated mass without material strength at lower
velocity has a larger diﬀerence between vertical and oblique impacts, it implies that ma-
terial strength is more eﬀective than a movement of the impactor. The heated mass with-
out material strength approaches that with material strength as vimp increases (see Fig-
ure 4 (d)). This is also consistent with previous ﬁndings (Quintana et al., 2015; Kuro-
sawa & Genda, 2018). As a result, the diﬀerence between the heated mass of 90◦ and
45◦ in the case without material strength approaches to that with material strength (Fig-
ure 4 (d)). Thus, the material strength more eﬀectively increases for the cumulative heated
mass in lower vimp scenarios than higher vimp.

We now consider the results with material strength and discuss the eﬀect of θimp

on impact heating. Previous work focused on oblique impacts at vimp = 5 km/s showed
that the cumulative heated mass of 90◦ and 45◦ are almost the same (Wakita et al., 2019).
We ﬁnd the heated mass of 75◦ and 60◦ are between that of 90◦ and 45◦, and their dif-
ference is within a factor of 1.5 (Figure 4 (c)). On the contrary, we ﬁnd that shallower
impacts (θimp ≤ 30◦) produce much less heated mass than 45◦ impacts. Grazing im-
pactors are decapitated before they penetrate into the target and heating is limited mainly
to the lower hemisphere (Schultz & Gault, 1990; Davison et al., 2011). While the heated
area of θimp ≤ 30◦ impacts has a similar width as the 45◦ impacts, the shallower pen-
etration of grazing impactors results in the heated area extending to smaller depths (see
dashed lines in Figure 1 (c) and (d)). As a result, the heated mass of θimp ≤ 30◦ be-
comes smaller than other higher angle impacts. Note that it is beyond the focus of our
paper to ﬁnd the threshold impact angle where cumulative heated mass begins decreas-
ing.

While the cumulative heated mass takes a similar value for > 45◦ impacts, the cu-
mulative heated mass by < 30◦ impacts is always less than that regardless of the impact
velocities (vimp). Our results show impacts of θimp ≥ 45◦ produce a similar heated mass
within less than a factor of 1.5 (right panels in Figure 4). Note that the results saturates
around M MS
target/Mimp ∼ 100 (see Figure 4 (d)), because our total computational region
in the target that we track with tracer particles is as large as Mtarget/Mimp (cid:39) 102 (see
Methods). On the contrary, the ratio of the cumulative heated mass with shallower an-
target(θimp = 45◦)) is ∼
gles (θimp ≤ 30◦) to that with θimp = 45◦ (M MS
0.6 (θimp = 30◦) and ∼ 0.2 (θimp = 15◦). Nevertheless, the heated mass from shal-
lower angle impacts (θimp ≤ 30◦) is less than steeper angle impacts, the eﬀect of ma-
terial strength on the degree of impact heating is still signiﬁcant (see Figure 4).

4 Discussion

Here we discuss the impact induced heated materials using our results. If the im-
pact heats the target enough beyond a threshold temperature, it could trigger Ar loss
and reset the target’s 40Ar-39Ar age. Kurosawa and Genda (2018) showed that the thresh-
old of impact velocity for Ar loss would be 2 km/s in the target with the material strength,
which is lower than 8 km/s in the case without material strength. We investigate the cu-
mulative heated mass of the impact-induced Ar age resetting during oblique impacts,
by assuming 1000 K as an index temperature, which is the closure temperature of typ-
ical Ar carrier mineral (e.g., feldspar, Cohen, 2013). Figure 5 summarizes the cumula-
tive heated mass of Tpeak > 1000 K in case of the material strength. The dependence
of the cumulative heated mass on θimp are similar regardless of vimp; the heated mass

of θimp ≥ 45◦ are always larger than θimp ≤ 30◦ at given vimp. The high-velocity im-
pacts produce a larger amount of the cumulative heated mass than the low-velocity case.
While 40Ar-39Ar age has been used to estimate the latest impact event on the parent body
of meteorites (Bogard, 2011), it is also possible to estimate their original depth. When
M MS
target/Mimp is suﬃciently large (e.g., ≥ 1), we can regard such an impact condition
as resetting the Ar age. Thus, our results showed that grazing impacts (e.g., θimp = 30◦
with 5 few km/s) can contribute to the Ar age resetting (Figure 5). Since grazing im-
pacts excavate relatively shallower material (see Figure 1 (d)), it may imply that me-
teorites might originate from shallower depth than previously thought.

We need to mention that the usage of Tpeak can exaggerate the cumulative heated
mass. Because the Tpeak records the temperature during the shock, it may be overesti-
mated due to the numerical diﬀusion. Even if the Tpeak is the same, the diﬀerence in pres-
sure may indicate the diﬀerent status (i.e., shock state or post-shock state). In such a
case, especially for the phenomena that would take a time to occur (e.g., dehydration),
the post-shock temperature (Tpost, the temperature after the pressure becomes less than
105 Pa) can be useful. When we compare the peak temperature with the post-shock tem-
perature, we ﬁnd that the former is overestimated by about 100 K in comparison with
the latter at Tpeak = 1000 K in the case of vimp = 5 km/s (Figure 6). Although Tpost
is a more accurate way, it is computationally expensive to examine all tracer particles
and incapable in our current work. Because some particles, that are at the contact be-
tween the impactor and the target, take a longer time (> 5ts) to decrease pressure to
105 Pa (see white region in Figure 7). However, the diﬀerence between Tpeak and Tpost
are acceptable and our estimate on Tpeak is appropriate in accounting the cumulative
heated mass. Kurosawa and Genda (2018) calculated the cumulative heated mass for Ar
loss using the entropy corresponding to 1000 K at 105 Pa. Our result of M MS
target/Mimp =
7.04 with a vertical impacts at vimp = 10 km/s are within 11% diﬀerence from their re-
sult of 6.32 (see Figure 3 in Kurosawa & Genda, 2018). This agreement, suggests that
the use of peak temperature to estimate the cumulative heated mass after the impact-
induced shock heating is reasonable.

It is worth exploring the dependence of the cumulative heated mass on impact an-

gle and velocity. To estimate the cumulative heated mass at various impact velocities
and angles, we derive an empirical formula. Note that an artiﬁcial increase in temper-
ature around the contact boundary between impactor and target in numerical simula-
tions is reported (Kurosawa & Genda, 2018). We use the numerical results over 0.3 Mimp
which are free from the artiﬁcial overheating and thus more conservative. To minimize
the number of coeﬃcients in the empirical formula, we adopt the following equation,

M formula

target (Tpeak)/Mimp = (cid:8)C1 sin(θimp) + C2 sin2(θimp) + (1 − C1 − C2) sin3(θimp)(cid:9) C3(0.5v2

imp/ETpeak)C4,

where ETpeak is the speciﬁc internal energy at Tpeak. The procedure to obtain the em-
pirical formula is described as follows. We prepare ﬁve datasets at a given impact ve-
locity (2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 km/s), which are the normalized heated mass as a function of
impact angle. We conﬁrm that the ﬁve datasets almost converge into a single trend against
the change in impact angle. Then, we ﬁt the all data with a third order polynomial func-
tion with two physical constraints, which are (1) the normalized heated mass equals zero
at θimp = 0◦, and (2) the normalized heated mass equals unity at θimp = 90◦. Thus,
the dependence of impact angle on the heated mass at a given impact velocity can be
described with two ﬁtting coeﬃcients (C1 and C2 within bracket in Equation 4). Next,
we divide the heated masses by the eﬀects of the impact angle, resulting in the corrected
heated mass depending only on impact velocity, which corresponds to the speciﬁc inter-
nal energy. The corrected data points can be ﬁtted well by a power-law with two ﬁtting
constants (C3 and C4 in Equation 4). By combining impact angle and velocity depen-
dence, we obtain the empirical formula shown as Equation (4) with four coeﬃcients. For
the case of Tpeak = 1000 K (Figure 5), we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcients are C1 = −0.249,
C2 = 3.40, C3 = 1.07, and C4 = 0.749, respectively. Note that ETpeak = 4.16 MJ/kg

at Tpeak = 1000 K. Figure 8 represents that the empirical formula works properly within
the error of ±21%(2σ) to our numerical results with material strength. This formula would
be useful to estimate the cumulative heated mass resulting from various impact condi-
tions.

We also discuss the occurrence of dehydration reactions of phyllosilicate (e.g., ser-

pentine). As the dehydration of hydrous materials is an endothermic reaction, additional
calculations are required to assess the dehydrated mass accurately (e.g., Kurosawa et al.,
2021). Additionally, Kurosawa et al. (2021) experimentally showed that the eﬃciency
of impact devolatilization on carbonaceous asteroid-like materials (e.g., calcite) is con-
siderably low (< 10% of theoretical prediction). Thus, the dehydrated mass estimated
by numerical simulations will overestimate regardless of considering the reaction heat.
Although we may overestimate the heated mass by using peak temperature but ignor-
ing the reaction heat, it is worth considering the impact conditions that may induce the
dehydration. We here take a temperature threshold for the dehydration as 873 K, at which
the dehydration of phyllosilicate starts to occur (Lange & Ahrens, 1982; Nozaki et al.,
2006; Nakato et al., 2008). Note that the Hugoniot curve for dunite and serpentine dif-
fers (Benz et al., 1989; Brookshaw, 1998). Based on shock heating alone, the serpentine
will reach a similar temperature of the dunite at a given impact condition. Thus, the amount
of dehydrated mass may not change even if the equation state of serpentine is used. Please
also note that our numerical setup is diﬀerent from previous work of investigating the
fate of hydrous minerals during the impacts which suggested that the serpentine in the
core can avoid the dehydration (Wakita & Genda, 2019). Since they considered a dunite
layer over the serpentine core, the dunite layer might insulate the serpentine core from
the direct impact-induced heating that we explore in this work. The vertical impact with
material strength at vimp = 2 km/s produces dehydrated materials of M MS
0.4 (Figures 4 and 9). Grazing impacts (θimp ≤ 30◦) into the target with material strength
require a higher impact velocity to produce a similar amount of impact heated material
as vertical impacts (see also Figure 9); θimp = 30◦ with vimp = 3 km/s (M MS
target/Mimp ∼
0.5) and θimp = 15◦ with vimp = 5 km/s (M MS
grazing impacts with material strength require lower velocities than vertical impacts with-
out material strength to produce a similar amount of impact heated material (at an im-

target/Mimp ∼ 0.4). Nevertheless, those

pact velocity of vimp = 7 km/s, M Hydro
target /Mimp ∼ 0.5, Figure 10). Oblique impacts gen-
erate heated materials at lower peak pressure than vertical impacts at a given impact
velocity (Wakita et al., 2019). We also ﬁnd grazing impacts at higher impact velocities
could produce dehydrated material at lower peak pressures than vertical impacts with
lower impact velocity (see Figure 11). As the high temperature region of oblique impacts
is widely distributed (see Figure 1), the weakly shocked region is also close to the sur-
face, potentially to be ejected. If this ejected material eventually lands on the Earth as
meteorites, this implies that shock heated meteorites could have experienced a wide range
of peak pressures. Thus, oblique impacts of θimp < 45◦ may have produced dehydrated
minerals in weakly shock-metamorphosed meteorites.

The time takes for hydrous minerals to dehydrate depends on the reaction temper-

ature. While dehydrated materials in carbonaceous chondrites indicate shock heating
(e.g., Nakamura, 2005; Nakato et al., 2008; Abreu & Bullock, 2013), carbonaceous chon-
drites have generally experienced weak shocks. The dehydration starts to occur at about
873 K (600 ◦C, Lange & Ahrens, 1982; Nozaki et al., 2006; Nakato et al., 2008), but some
work examines the duration time at higher temperature. Nozaki et al. (2006) conducted
heating experiments on carbonaceous chondrites: Both short (10 s) and long (120 s) heat-
ing at a temperature of 1173 K (900 ◦C) decomposed the hydrous minerals. They in-
dicated that the temperature is more important for dehydration than duration. Other
experimental work implies that a weakly-shocked and dehydrated carbonaceous chon-
drite would have experienced 1–100 hour heating at 1173 K or a 10-1000 days heating
at 973 K (700 ◦C) (Nakato et al., 2008). While our impact simulations are unable to con-
sider the duration materials spend at elevated temperatures, we can estimate the cool-
ing time of the hydrous materials. Assuming that hydrous material is heated to a depth
of 10 m (d, smaller than our cell size), its cooling time scale would be over 10,000 days.
Note that we take the thermal diﬀusivity (κ) of 10−7m2/s, which is a typical value of
the carbonaceous chondrite (Opeil et al., 2020), and calculate tcool ∼ d2/κ. The ma-
terial in much deeper locations would take longer time. Although we are unaware of the
time to dehydrate at 873 K, the cumulative heated mass above 873 K may represent the
amount of dehydrated minerals.

5 Conclusions

The mass heated by oblique impacts is a key to the understanding of the history

of asteroids and meteorites. While Kurosawa and Genda (2018) clariﬁed the importance
of the material strength of the target in the vertical impact, the following work conﬁrmed
this in the oblique impacts at a given impact velocity and angles (Wakita et al., 2019).
We advanced their work by examining the dependence of the impact velocities and an-
gles. Considering material strength in the target, we have performed a series of oblique
impact simulations over a range of impact velocities and angles. The cumulative heated
mass in the target with material strength is always larger than that without material
strength, which indicates the material strength enhances impact heating. Our oblique
impacts simulations with material strength showed that vertical impacts and impacts
with steeper angles (≥ 45◦) generate a similar cumulative heated mass, within a factor
of 1.5. Grazing angle impacts (≤ 30◦) produce less heated mass than other oblique im-
pacts regardless of impact velocity. From our impact simulations of a wide parameter
space, we derived an empirical formula for material with peak temperature over 1000 K,
which can be used to understand 40Ar-39Ar age resetting. Vertical impacts at low im-
pact velocity and grazing impacts at high impact velocity produce a similar heated mass,
but have diﬀerences in their peak pressure, indicating that grazing impacts are more likely
to be responsible for impact heating in weakly shocked meteorites.

Open Research

All our data are given by using iSALE-3D and our input ﬁles are available (Wakita

et al., 2022). We also provide the cumulative heated mass of various impacts with/without
material strength for Tpeak of every 10 K as a Data Set. Please note that usage of the
iSALE-3D code is restricted to those who have contributed to the development of iSALE-
2D, and iSALE-2D is distributed on a case-by-case basis to academic users in the im-
pact community. It requires a registration from the iSALE webpage (https://isale-code.github.io/)
and usage of iSALE-2D and computational requirements are also shown in there. We
directly plot ﬁgures from our binary data using pySALEPlot which is included in iSALE-
3D and developed by TMD. Please also note that pySALEPlot in the current stable re-
lease of iSALE-2D (Dellen) would not work for the data from iSALE-3D.
