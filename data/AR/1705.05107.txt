Abstract: A measurement of ionization yields in noble-gas liquids is relevant to the energy
calibration of nuclear recoil detectors for dark matter search and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering
experiments. In this work we further study the ionization yield of nuclear recoils in liquid Ar, using
a two-phase detector with an electroluminescence gap and DD neutron generator. The ionization
yields of nuclear recoils in liquid Ar were measured at 233 keV and electric ﬁelds of 0.56 and 0.62
kV/cm; their values amounted to 5.9 ± 0.8 and 7.4 ± 1 e−/keV, respectively. The characteristic
dependences of the ionization yield on energy and electric ﬁeld were determined, while comparing
the results obtained to those at lower energies and higher ﬁelds.

Keywords: Charge transport, multiplication and electroluminescence in rare gases and liquids; No-
ble liquid detectors (scintillation, ionization, double-phase); Dark Matter detectors (WIMPs,axions,
etc.)

The energy calibration of nuclear recoil detectors using liquid Ar and Xe detection media is of
paramount importance in rare-event experiments such as those of direct dark matter search and
coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering [1]. Such a calibration is usually performed by measuring the
ionization yield and scintillation eﬃciency of nuclear recoils, using neutron elastic scattering oﬀ
nuclei. While for liquid Xe there are ample experimental data on such yields [2–4], little is known
about the ionization yield in liquid Ar.

The ﬁrst results on the ionization yield of nuclear recoils in liquid Ar were obtained just in
the last three years: at lower energies, at 6.7 keV [5] and 17-57 keV [6], and at higher energies, at
80 and 233 keV [7]. In the present work we continue the studies of the ionization yield in liquid
Ar, using a new nuclear recoil detector as compared to our previous work [7], namely a two-phase
Cryogenic Avalanche Detector (CRAD) with an electroluminescence (EL) gap. The present study
complements the previous measurements and thus might be relevant to future dark matter search
experiments [8, 9] and to thorough understanding of the ionization yield in liquid Ar.

The ionization yield measured in experiment is deﬁned as follows:

Qy = ne/E0 .

(1.1)

Here ne is the primary ionization charge, i.e. the number of ionization electrons escaping recombi-
nation with positive ions; it depends on the energy deposited by a recoil nucleus in the liquid (E0)
and on the electric ﬁeld in the liquid (E). ne is always smaller than the initial number of ion pairs
produced in the liquid by a nuclear recoil (Ni). In the absence of a complete recombination model,
it is generally accepted that the following parametrization works well [1]:

ne =

Ni
1 + k/E

.

(1.2)

where k is a ﬁtting parameter.

Equations (1.1) and (1.2) are valid for both electron recoils, induced by electron or gamma-ray
irradiation, and nuclear recoils; it is conventional to refer to the corresponding recoil energy in
units of keVee (electron-equivalent) and keVnr. The goal of the present study is to measure Qy for
nuclear recoils in liquid Ar at 233 keV and diﬀerent electric ﬁelds and to compare it to those of
previous experiments.

The present study was performed in the course of the development of two-phase Cryogenic

Avalanche Detectors (CRADs) of ultimate sensitivity for rare-event experiments [10–17].

2 Experimental setup

In our previous work [7], a two-phase CRAD with charge (double-THGEM) readout was used to
measure the ionization yield of nuclear recoils. In the present work, we modiﬁed the nuclear recoil
detector and the measurement conditions: see ﬁgures 1(a) and 1(b). Firstly, we used a two-phase
CRAD with optical readout, i.e with electroluminescence (EL) gap read out with cryogenic PMTs,
which was supposed to have better energy resolution. Such a two-phase CRAD with EL gap was
similar to that used in our recent studies of proportional electroluminescence in two-phase Ar
[13, 15]. Secondly, the active volume of the detector was increased by a factor of 6 compared
to [7], by increasing the liquid Ar layer thickness, which allowed one to signiﬁcantly reduce the
measurement time. Thirdly, the measurements of the yield were performed at much lower electric
ﬁelds in liquid Ar as compared to [7], at 0.56 and 0.62 kV/cm, which are more typical for dark
matter search experiments [8, 9].

The experimental setup included a vacuum-insulated cryostat with a nine-litre cryogenic cham-
ber. The detector was operated in a two-phase mode in the equilibrium state, at a saturated vapour
pressure of 1.0 atm and at a temperature of 87 K. The Ar was puriﬁed by an Oxisorb ﬁlter, providing
an electron life-time in the liquid of ≥100 µs [15].

(4 mm thick), in the liquid phase, and EL gap (18 mm thick), in the gas phase. All regions had
an active area of 10×10 cm2. The EL gap was viewed by four compact cryogenic 2-inch PMTs
R6041-506MOD [12], located on the perimeter of the gap and separated from the high-ﬁeld region
by an acrylic box with WLS (wavelength shifter) ﬁlms deposited in front of each PMT. The WLS
ﬁlms were needed to convert the VUV emission of pure Ar into visible light.

The primary ionization charge in the two-phase CRAD was produced by either X-rays from a
241Am source having a 59.5 keV line or by neutrons from a DD neutron generator. The primary
ionization electrons produced in liquid Ar were ﬁrst drifted towards and then emitted into the EL
gap, where they were recorded via proportional electroluminescence using PMTs. The optical
signals from the four PMTs were linearly summed and then ampliﬁed with a linear ampliﬁer with
a shaping time of 200 ns. The trigger was provided by the PMT signal itself at a certain detection
threshold, well above the electronic and PMT noises. Since the electroluminescence signal was
rather long, of several microseconds, the signal amplitude was deﬁned as its pulse area.

To produce neutrons a specially designed neutron generator was used that continuously emitted
monoenergetic neutrons (not collimated) with the kinetic energy of 2.45 MeV obtained in the
DD fusion reaction [18–20]. The neutron ﬂux was of the order of 104 s−1 over full solid angle.
The neutron generator (operated at 80 kV and wrapped in a 1 cm thick Pb screen to suppress
bremsstrahlung gamma-rays) was placed underneath the two-phase CRAD at a distance of about
10 cm from the active volume.

Other details of the experimental setup and measurement procedures were described elsewhere

[7, 13, 15].

3 Experimental results

The method to measure the ionization yield of nuclear recoils was similar to that of [7]. The basic
idea of the method is to compare the experimental amplitude spectrum of nuclear recoils expressed
in terms of the primary ionization charge (e−) to the theoretical spectrum expressed in terms of the
nuclear recoil energy (keVnr). The experimental session was composed of the measurement runs
during which the amplitude spectra were recorded: that with a neutron generator on and that with
a neutron generator oﬀ (to measure the background contribution): see ﬁgure 2. To obtain the real
neutron scattering-induced spectrum, the latter should be subtracted from the former. To calibrate
the amplitude scale in terms of the primary ionization charge, the detector was also irradiated with
59.5 keV X-rays from 241Am source in the calibration runs: see the inset in the ﬁgure. In addition
in these calibration runs the amplitude resolution of the detector (σ/E) was measured: it amounted
to 29% and 23% at 0.56 and 0.62 kV/cm, respectively.

In eq. (1.1) one should ﬁrst determine ne from the spectra of ﬁgure 2. For this the signal
amplitude should be normalized to that of 59.5 keV peak and then converted to the primary
ionization charge. For the latter one should know, in turn, the ionization yields for 59.5 keV X-rays
in liquid Ar, i.e. for electron recoils induced by X-ray absorption in liquid Ar; these were deduced
from our previous work [14], for given electric ﬁelds in liquid Ar.

After subtracting the background-run contribution, the amplitude distribution still contains
the gamma-ray background associated with (n, γ) reactions in surrounding materials. Similarly to

Figure 2. Signal amplitude distribution of the two-phase CRAD in the measurement runs when the neutron
generator was on (DD neutron generator run) and oﬀ (Background run). In the inset, the signal amplitude
distribution induced by X-rays from a 241Am source in the calibration run is shown.

[7], this background was accounted for by ﬁtting by a linear decreasing function: see the inset in
ﬁgure 3.

Figure 3 shows the desired ionization charge spectrum in liquid Ar induced by nuclear recoils
due to neutron scattering; the spectrum is obtained from ﬁgure 2 using 59.5 keV X-ray line calibration
and subtracting the background-run and gamma-ray contributions. The next step is to compare this
experimental spectrum to the theoretical one.

The theoretical spectrum was computed similarly to [7], using simulation code Scattronix de-
veloped in [21] and diﬀerential cross-sections of neutron scattering [22]: it is shown in ﬁgure 4. The
convolution of the theoretical spectrum with the energy resolution of the two-phase CRAD obtained
in experiment (29%) is also shown; just this spectrum should be compared to the experimental one.
The backward scattering component (the shoulder) in both the experimental and theoretical spectra
is well approximated by a linear function: see ﬁgure 3 and the inset in ﬁgure 4. Similarly to [7],
the ionization yield at 233 keV was determined using the spectrum end-point (the horizontal axis
intersection of the linear function ﬁt): the ionization charge value (in the experimental spectrum)
was divided by that of the nuclear recoil energy (in the theoretical spectrum). The ionization yield
values at two electric ﬁelds measured that way are as follows: Qy = 5.9 ± 0.8 e−/keV at 0.56 kV/cm
and Qy = 7.4 ± 1.0 e−/keV at 0.62 kV/cm. These are presented in table 1 along with the data of our
previous work [7], showing also the appropriate statistical and systematic uncertainties.

In addition to the ionization yield, the ionization eﬃciency (ionization quench factor) can be
determined. The ionization eﬃciency is deﬁned as the ratio of the ionization yield of nuclear recoils
(Qy,nr ) to that of electron recoils (Qy,ee), at the same energy: Lion = Qy,nr /Qy,ee. Combining the
data of table 1 and the data of ionization yield of electron recoils from [14], one can obtain that
Lion amounts to 0.31 ± 0.06 at 0.56 kV/cm and 0.37 ± 0.07 at 0.62 kV/cm.

4 Comparison with theoretical model and with other experiments

Basically there are two theoretical models that can describe the recombination eﬀect in liquid
noble gases and consequently the energy and ﬁeld dependence of the ionization yield of nuclear
recoils: that of Thomas-Imel [23, 24], applicable mostly at lower energies, and that of Jaﬀe [25, 26],
applicable mostly at higher energies. For the ionization yield, the Thomas-Imel and Jaﬀe models
predict the decreasing and increasing function of energy, respectively.

Accordingly, we used here the Jaﬀe model for data analysis in its compact form [26]

ne =

Ni
1 + kB(dE/dx)/E

,

resulting in the following equation for the ionization yield [7]:

Qy =

f
[1 + kB(dE/dx)/E][Eg + Eph(Nex/Ni)]

.

(4.1)

(4.2)

Here kB is a parameter; it is determined experimentally from the ﬁeld dependence of the
data (ﬁgure 5). Other parameters are taken the same as in [7]. In particular, the stopping power
for excitation and ionization, dE/dx, is calculated using a SRIM program [27]. Ei = Ni Eg and
Eex = Nex Eph. Here Eg (cid:39) 14.2 eV is the band gap in liquid Ar; Eph = 9.7 eV is the average energy
of scintillation photon. Nex/Ni is the ratio of the number of excitations to that of ionizations; its
value is taken the same as in [7], Nex/Ni = 2, at which the energy dependence was better described
f is the Lindhard factor; it is deﬁned as the energy fraction transferred to
within the Jaﬀe model.
ionization (Ei) and excitation (Eex), f = (Ei + Eex)/E0; it was calculated using the SRIM program
[27].

Figure 5 shows the ﬁeld dependence of the ionization yield at 233 keV, combining the data of
the current and previous work [7]. The data are described by the model of eq. (1.2) or by Jaﬀe model
of eq. (4.2), where k or kB is a free parameter. Both models ﬁt well to the data points, resulting in
k = 0.48 ± 0.26 kV/cm and kB = 0.94 ± 0.17 (V mg)/(keV cm3). Note that the latter value is close
to kB = 1.35 (V mg)/(keV cm3) used in our previous work [7], where it was determined from the
ﬁeld dependence at 6.7 keV [5].

Now we can try to determine the energy dependence of the ionization yield, combining the data
of all three experiments in the ﬁeld: those at 6.7 keV [5], 17-57 keV [6] and 233 keV (this work).
The data are extrapolated to the electric ﬁeld value of 0.56 kV/cm; the result is shown in ﬁgure 6.
One can see that the remarkable energy dependence is revealed: the ionization yield ﬁrst decreases

It is amazing that a similar energy
dependence was observed for electron recoils in liquid Ar when combining the data from diﬀerent
experiments [14]: see ﬁgure 7. On the other hand, the energy dependence for nuclear recoils in
liquid Xe seems to be monotonic in the range of 1-300 keVnr [31].

5 Conclusions

In this work we further study the ionization yield of nuclear recoils in liquid Ar, using a two-phase
detector with electroluminescence gap and DD neutron generator. The ionization yield in liquid
Ar at 233 keV was measured to be 5.9 ± 0.8 and 7.4 ± 1 e−/keV at an electric ﬁeld of 0.56 and
0.62 kV/cm, respectively; the ionization quench factor amounted to 0.31 ± 0.06 and 0.37 ± 0.07,
respectively. The characteristic dependences of the ionization yield on the energy and electric ﬁeld
were determined, when comparing the results obtained to those of lower energies and higher ﬁelds.
In particular, the remarkable energy dependence has been presumably revealed, when the ionization
yield passes through a minimum with the energy increase. The results of such a study are relevant
to the energy calibration of liquid noble gas detectors for dark matter search experiments and for
thorough understanding of the ionization yield in liquid Ar.
