ABSTRACT
Recent observational advances have enabled high resolution mapping of 44Ti in core-collapse supernova
(CCSN) remnants. Comparisons between observations and models provide stringent constraints on the CCSN
mechanism. However, past work has identiﬁed several uncertain nuclear reaction rates that inﬂuence 44Ti
and 56Ni production in post-processing model calculations. We evolved one dimensional models of 15 M(cid:12),
18 M(cid:12), 22 M(cid:12) and 25 M(cid:12) stars from zero-age main sequence through CCSN using MESA (Modules for
Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) and investigated the previously identiﬁed reaction rate sensitivities of
44Ti and 56Ni production. We tested the robustness of our results by making various assumptions about
the CCSN explosion energy and mass-cut. We found a number of reactions that have a signiﬁcant impact
on the nucleosynthesis of 44Ti and 56Ni, particularly for lower progenitor masses. Notably, the reaction
rates 13N(α, p)16O, 17F(α, p)20Ne, 52Fe(α, p)55Co, 56Ni(α, p)59Cu, 57Ni(n, p)57Co, 56Co(p, n)56Ni,
39K(p, γ)40Ca, 47V(p, γ)48Cr, 52Mn(p, γ)53Fe, 57Co(p, γ)58Ni, and 39K(p, α)36Ar are inﬂuential for a
large number of model conditions. Furthermore, we found the list of inﬂuential reactions identiﬁed by
previous post-processing studies of CCSN shock-driven nucleosynthesis is likely incomplete, motivating future
larger-scale sensitivity studies.

1. INTRODUCTION
Stars with initial mass (cid:38) 8 M(cid:12) undergo a core-collapse
supernova (CCSN) explosion after core fuel exhaustion
(Woosley & Janka 2005). The CCSN enriches the interstel-
lar medium by releasing the isotopes synthesized throughout
its life cycle and during CCSN nucleosynthesis. Among the
ejected isotopes, 44Ti and 56Ni are produced near the bound-
ary of the proto-neutron star remnant and the ejecta, and are
thus studied to gain insight into details of the CCSN mech-
anism (Young et al. 2006; Young & Fryer 2007; Fryer et al.
2012; Fryer et al. 2018).

Observations of 44Ti in CCSN remnants are possible due
to characteristic γ-rays at 67.9, 78.3, and 1157.0 keV emitted
in the decay sequence 44Ti (t1/2 = 59.1 y) → 44Sc (t1/2 =
3.97 h) → 44Ca (stable) (Chen et al. 2011). 56Ni, on the
other hand, follows the much briefer decay sequence 56Ni
(t1/2 = 6.08 d) → 56Co (t1/2 = 77.2 d) → 56Fe (Junde
et al. 2011). As such, CCSN 56Ni production is generally

for the Evolution of the Elements

inferred from observations of the remnant iron, e.g. for the
Cassiopeia A (CasA) supernova of 1671 AD (Eriksen et al.
2009).

Comparing such observational constraints to yields from
CCSN model calculations offers the opportunity to constrain
properties of the CCSN explosion, such as the explosion en-
ergy and duration, as well as the remnant mass (Aufderheide
et al. 1991; Young et al. 2006; Young & Fryer 2007; M¨uller
et al. 2017; Fryer et al. 2018; Sawada & Maeda 2019). How-
ever, model calculation results for 44Ti and 56Ni yields have
been shown to have signiﬁcant sensitivities to variations in
nuclear reaction rates (The et al. 1998; Hoffman et al. 1999;
Magkotsios et al. 2010). This is particularly problematic as
many of the relevant reaction rates have poor experimental
constraints. Nuclear physics measurements can be prioritized
with the aid of sensitivity studies, whereby nuclear reaction
rates are varied within an uncertainty factor and the impact
on the model calculation results is assessed.

Large scale investigations of nuclear reaction rate uncer-
tainties impacting shock-driven nucleosynthesis in CCSN
were previously performed by The et al. (1998) and Magkot-
sios et al. (2010). These pioneering works used analytic
temperature-density trajectories in nucleosynthesis post-

processing calculations, varying nuclear reaction rates by
factors of /100 and ×100. They identiﬁed several nuclear
reaction rates that can impact 44Ti and 56Ni nucleosynthe-
sis for temperature and density trajectories approximating
material heated by the expanding shock following a super-
nova core bounce. We build on prior work in the following
ways: (1) We perform stellar evolution and CCSN calcula-
tions with one-dimensional models in an effort to focus on
astrophysical conditions that are most relevant to compar-
isons with astronomical observations. (2) We vary nuclear
reaction rates by realistic rate variation factors based on ex-
isting nuclear physics constraints in order to avoid focusing
on cases which are already sufﬁciently constrained. (3) We
cross-check whether the prioritized reaction rate lists re-
sulting from prior studies are comprehensive. We note that
similar work has been done by Hoffman et al. (2010) and
Tur et al. (2010), but for a much smaller set of reaction rate
variations.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss
the model details for massive star evolution and subsequent
CCSN. In Section 3 we detail temperature and density evolu-
tion during CCSN for comparison with prior post-processing
work. In Section 4 we present the explosion details, nucle-
osynthetic yields of 44Ti and 56Ni from our baseline CCSN
calculations, and compare to yields determined by observa-
tions and previous modeling efforts. In Section 5 we present
our list of varied reaction rates and adopted reaction rate vari-
ation factors. In Section 6 we present nuclear physics sensi-
tivities, explaining the rate impacts in terms of the nuclear re-
action network. In Section 7 we compare our results with the
post-processing calculations of The et al. (1998) and Magkot-
sios et al. (2010). We conclude in Section 8, with brief sug-
gestions for future work involving astrophysics model calcu-
lations and nuclear physics experiments.

2. MESA CALCULATIONS

We performed one-dimensional, multi-zone model calcu-
lations using MESA1(Modules for Experiments in Stellar As-
trophysics), which is an open-source code for modeling stel-
lar evolution and stellar explosions (Paxton et al. 2011, 2015,
2018; Paxton et al. 2019). In order to perform CCSN, we ran
our simulations in two different stages using MESA version
7624, consisting of evolution to core collapse followed by
the supernova explosion.

In stage one, we evolved non-rotating, solar metallicity
(Z = 0.02) Mprog = 15 M(cid:12), 18 M(cid:12), 22 M(cid:12) and 25 M(cid:12)
progenitors from zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) to the on-
set of core-collapse, as this is within the suspected ZAMS
mass range for progenitors of CCSN remnants with observed
44Ti (P´erez-Rend´on et al. 2002; Young et al. 2006; Wong-

wathanarat et al. 2017). Our stage one calculations are
based on Farmer et al. (2016), using the 204 isotope net-
work mesa 204.net2, the JINA ReacLib reaction rate li-
brary version V2.0 2013-04-02 (Cyburt et al. 2010), and the
Dutch wind scheme that is based on Refs. (Nieuwenhui-
jzen & de Jager 1990; Nugis & Lamers 2000; Vink et al.
2001; Glebbeek et al. 2009) with an efﬁciency scale factor
η = 0.8 (Maeder & Meynet 2001). The spatial resolution re-
sulted in the number of zones varying between ∼ 450 − 1200
zones, with the number of zones tending to increase in later
stages of stellar evolution. The onset of core-collapse was
deﬁned as the time when any mass zone at the interior of the
star exceeded an infall velocity of 1000 km s−1 (Farmer et al.
2016).

Stage two took the ﬁnal stellar model of stage one and car-
ried this into the CCSN phase, following the procedure de-
scribed by Paxton et al. (2015), which is divided into four
distinct steps:

1. Run MESA using inlist adjust, where we adjust
several control parameters for initiating CCSN simula-
tions. The astrophysical parameters were chosen fol-
lowing Farmer et al. (2016). Notable among them are
absence of any prescription to mimic rotation and the
choice of the Dutch wind scheme with η = 0.8.

2. Run MESA using inlist remove core, where we
deﬁne and remove the stellar core. The outer mass co-
ordinate of the core, i.e. the deepest zone of the model,
is deﬁned by the inner mass boundary Ib, located at the
mass coordinate just outside the Fe core (as speciﬁed
in Table 1).

3. Run MESA using inlist edep, which employs the
“thermal bomb” mechanism (e.g. Young & Fryer 2007;
Paxton et al. 2015) to inject energy Einj ∼ 1051
erg (Fryer et al. 2012) into a thin mass shell ∆Mshell =
0.05M(cid:12) above Ib (the innermost ∼ 20 zones) over a
time period tinj = 20 ms. As speciﬁed in Table 1, we
inject Einj = 0.5 foe3 in 15 M(cid:12) and 18 M(cid:12) models;
1.32 foe in 15 M(cid:12), 18 M(cid:12), and 22 M(cid:12); and 3.5 foe
in 22 M(cid:12) and 25 M(cid:12) ZAMS stars. These explosion
energies were roughly based on the ﬁndings of Var-
tanyan et al. (2019); Fryer et al. (2012); Paxton et al.
(2015); Nomoto (2014), where the speciﬁc energies
were somewhat arbitrarily chosen in order to span a
plausible range.

We limited our ourselves to a single tinj to keep the
overall number of calculations manageable. Our

2 Magkotsios et al. (2010) found this network size is sufﬁcient for the

temperature and density phase-space and initial Ye relevant for our work.

choice of tinj was motivated in part by the ﬁnding
of Fryer et al. (2012) that most supernovae have explo-
sion energies Eexp > 1051 erg, which can be reached
if the explosion occurs less than 250 ms after core
bounce. Additionally, the analysis of Sawada & Maeda
(2019) suggests short explosion timescales are more
consistent with observations. The speciﬁc choice of
tinj = 20 ms corresponds to the fast-explosion time
scale for thermal bomb models explored in Young &
Fryer (2007). To explore the impact of this choice, we
performed CCSN calculations for the 18 M(cid:12) model
using Einj= 1.32 foe and tinj = 3, 20, and 200 ms,
comparing the yield of 44Ti (see Section 4). The
20 ms calculations were in closer agreement with the
44Ti yields of 3D models and observations, further
motivating our choice. Similarly, we explored using
∆Mshell = 0.02 M(cid:12), ﬁnding little impact on the 44Ti
and 56Ni yields.

4. Run MESA using inlist explosion, which fol-
lows the thermodynamic and nucleosynthetic evolu-
tion of the stellar envelope due to the shockwave prop-
agating outward from the thermal bomb energy depo-
sition region. Nuclear reaction rates were varied in this
step of the calculations.

3. EVOLUTION OF TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY

DURING CCSN

As the shock wave powered by the thermal bomb propa-
gates towards the stellar surface, it changes the thermody-
namic conditions in the regions of the star that it sweeps
through. We quantify the impact on thermodynamic condi-
tions by comparing to analytic temperature-density trajecto-
ries, namely exponential and power-law, often used in post-
processing studies (e.g. The et al. 1998; Magkotsios et al.
2010). Both trajectories are characterized by a peak tem-
perature T0 and peak density ρ0, followed by expansion and
cooling with constant T 3ρ−1 (Magkotsios et al. 2010).

The exponential trajectory is based on Fowler & Hoyle
(1964), where material heated to T0 and compressed to ρ0
undergoes adiabatic expansion, and the expansion timescale
τ is equal to the free-fall timescale:

τ = (24πGρ0)−1/2 ≈ 446(ρ0)−1/2 s,

(1)

where G is Newton’s gravitation constant. The associated
temporal evolution of temperature and density are described
by Magkotsios et al. (2010); Harris et al. (2017); Fryer et al.

The power-law proﬁle is based on a constant-velocity (ho-

Fryer et al. (2018), where the temporal evolution of shock-
heated material is described as

T (t) =

ρ(t) =

To inform comparisons with prior post-processing studies
using these analytic trajectories, we separately ﬁt the temper-
ature and density evolution of each zone of our models using
Equations 2 and 3. We found that the power-law proﬁle pro-
vides a superior reproduction of our data. This is consistent
with Fryer et al. (2018), who found the power-law describes
their data particularly well once the shock-heated material
drops out of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE).

versed by radial mass zones in MESA for CCSN resulting from
Mprog = 15 M(cid:12), 18 M(cid:12), 22 M(cid:12), and 25 M(cid:12) models. As iden-
tiﬁed in Magkotsios et al. (2010), regions labelled in the plot are
deﬁned as A: Si-rich, B: Normal, C: QSE leakage, and D: α-rich.
The legend refers to Mprog, followed by Einj in 1051 erg. The
color map indicates the 44Ti mass fraction X(44Ti), as calculated
for power law trajectories with Ye = 0.498 by Magkotsios et al.
(2010).

Magkotsios et al. (2010) studied the trends for 44Ti and
56Ni production in the T0–ρ0 plane for both exponential and
power law proﬁles. Figure 1 shows a color map of their
44Ti production across the T0–ρ0 phase-space for the power-
law proﬁle (Equation 3) with electron-fraction Ye = 0.498,
which is close to the average Ye = 0.498 − 0.499 range that
we observe across each of our progenitor stars. For each
Mprog and Einj used in our CCSN calculations, we deter-
mined T0 and ρ0 for each mass zone, including these as data
points in Figure 1. The ﬁgure includes labels for the four
regions identiﬁed by Magkotsios et al. (2010) that are char-
acterized by speciﬁc nuclear burning patterns and govern the
yield of 44Ti. Region A corresponds to incomplete silicon
burning. Region B corresponds to normal freeze-out from
NSE, where the abundance is largely determined from the
Q-values of the reactions (Woosley et al. 1973; Meyer 1994;

The et al. 1998; Hix & Thielemann 1999). Region C corre-
sponds to the chasm region, where nucleosynthesis is char-
acterized by the ﬂow of material from a low-A quasistatic
equilibium (QSE) cluster containing 44Ti to a high-A cluster
containing 56Ni. Region D corresponds to the α-rich freeze
out (Woosley et al. 1973).

Magkotsios et al. (2010) demonstrated that the yield of
44Ti in shock-driven nucleosynthesis depends sensitively on
the location in the T0–ρ0 plane and the expansion proﬁle fol-
lowed by the shock-heated material. The reaction rate sen-
sitivities reported by that work were therefore speciﬁed by
phase-space region and expansion proﬁle, including the im-
pact on the topology of the phase space (e.g. chasm widen-
ing). Figure 1 shows that our Mprog = 15 M(cid:12) Einj =
0.5 foe model is limited to lower values of T0 and does not
cross the chasm region (Region C), while any other combina-
tion of Einj with progenitor mass Mprog extends to higher T0
and ρ0, into the α-rich freeze-out (Region D). The increase in
maximum T0 and ρ0 with increasing Mprog and Einj is also
apparent.

seconds after the deposition of Einj for calculations with Mprog =
15 M(cid:12). Einj is indicated by the line type: 0.50 foe (solid) and 1.32
foe (dotted).

4. YIELDS OF 44TI AND 56NI FROM BASELINE
CALCULATIONS

Prior to discussing the impact of varied nuclear reaction
rates on 44Ti and 56Ni production, we ﬁrst present results
from our calculations using the baseline reaction rate library.
The yields presented in Table 1 were determined by integrat-
ing the total mass of 44Ti or 56Ni outward from a lower-
bound in mass known as the mass-cut Mcut (Diehl & Timmes
1998). To help assess the impact of this arbitrary bound-
ary on our results, we explored three choices of Mcut: Ib,
Ib + ∆Mshell, and M4. The latter is deﬁned as the mass zone
where entropy per nucleon s = 4, beyond which higher-
dimensional models have found most material avoids fall-
back onto the proto-neutron star (Ertl et al. 2016). In order
to compare with post-processing calculations, we determine

Figure 3. Total mass of 44Ti and 56Ni outside of Mcut = Ib from
our calculations, where the legend indicates Mprog, Einj, Mcut. Re-
sults from previous observational and modeling work is shown for
context. See text for details.

X(44Ti) and X(56Ni) over the region between Mcut and the
mass coordinate where there is no longer oxygen-burning,
determining the mass-fraction per zone and taking an aver-
age weighted by the mass of each zone.

Figure 2 shows selected mass fractions following shock-
driven nucleosynthesis for example calculations, with one
value of Mcut shown for context. Clearly the choice of Mcut
and Einj will signiﬁcantly affect yields of 44Ti and 56Ni,
highlighting the need to explore nuclear sensitivities for mul-
tiple scenarios.

Figure 3 compares yields of 44Ti and 56Ni from our base-
line calculations using various combinations of Mprog, Einj,
and Mcut to yields from model calculations of earlier stud-
ies, as well as inferred yields from astronomical observa-
tions. The boundary for observations of 1987A is based on
the results of Boggs et al. (2015) (M (44Ti) = (1.5 ± 0.3) ×
10−4 M(cid:12)), Jerkstrand et al. (2011) (M (44Ti) = (1.5±0.5)×
10−4 M(cid:12)), Grebenev et al. (2012) (M (44Ti) = (3.1±0.8)×
10−4 M(cid:12)), and Seitenzahl et al. (2014) (M (44Ti) = (0.55 ±
0.17)×10−4 M(cid:12), M (56Ni) = (7.1±0.3)×10−2 M(cid:12)). The
boundary for observations of CasA is from Wang & Li (2016)
(M (44Ti) = (1.3 ± 0.4) × 10−4 M(cid:12)), Siegert et al. (2015)
(M (44Ti) = (1.37 ± 0.19) × 10−4 M(cid:12)), Grefenstette et al.
(2014) (M (44Ti) = (1.25 ± 0.3) × 10−4 M(cid:12)), and Erik-
sen et al. (2009) (M (56Ni) = 5.8 − 16.0 × 10−2 M(cid:12)).
The boundary labeled W15-2-cw-llb is from the 3D model
calculation of Wongwathanarat et al. (2017) that resembled
CasA. We note that comparisons to CasA may not be partic-
ularly relevant for this work, as this supernova is suspected
to have originated from a progenitor that lost much of its hy-
drogen envelope (Koo et al. 2020). Results from 1D model
calculations of Rauscher et al. (2002), Limongi & Chiefﬁ
(2003), and Chiefﬁ & Limongi (2013) are also shown for
Mprog = 15 − 25 M(cid:12). While our 56Ni yields are similar
to these previous 1D calculations, our 44Ti yields are gen-

erally lower, especially for our 18 and 22 M(cid:12) progenitors.
This is likely due to the different explosion mechanism (the
other works do not employ a thermal bomb) and our choice
of Einj and tinj (Young & Fryer 2007; Fryer et al. 2012; Fryer
et al. 2018), but a more comprehensive cross-model compar-
ison, which is beyond the scope of the present work, would
be necessary to comment further.

To provide further context for comparisons to earlier 1D
modeling work, we calculate the explosion energy Eexp as
described by Aufderheide et al. (1991) and restated in Equa-
tions 4 and 5:

where

Eexp = Einj + Eb + ∆En,

Eb = Ek − EGv + Eint.

(4)

(5)

Here Ek is the total kinetic energy, EGv is the total gravita-
tional energy, Eint is the total internal energy, Eb is the total
binding energy, and ∆En is the nuclear binding energy re-
leased by burning. All the energy values are calculated from
Ib to the surface of a star. Compared to previous works, e.g.
Aufderheide et al. (1991); Rauscher et al. (2002); Limongi &
Chiefﬁ (2003), our calculations with the lower of two Einj for

a given Mprog result in relatively low Eexp, though the high
Einj Mprog = 22 M(cid:12) and 25 M(cid:12) cases result in relatively
high Eexp.

5. REACTION RATE VARIATIONS

For each combination of Mprog and Einj listed in Ta-
ble 1, we performed reaction rate variations and assessed the
change in 44Ti and 56Ni yields relative to the baseline calcu-
lation. Given the computational expense, we chose to vary a
single reaction rate at a time, as opposed to varying several
rates at once in a Monte Carlo fashion (e.g. Bliss et al. 2020).
We limited our investigation to the 49 reaction rates identi-
ﬁed as high impact by Magkotsios et al. (2010), excluding
the weak rates identiﬁed in that work, along with two addi-
tional reaction rates chosen to test the completeness of the
49-rate list. The reaction list, given in Table 2, includes the
additional two reactions 27Al(α, n)30P and 39K(p, α)36Ar
based on suspected impact due to the reaction network ﬂow
(See Figure 7).

Similar past studies have often adopted reaction rate vari-
ation factors ×100 and /100 (e.g. The et al. 1998; Magkot-
sios et al. 2010), since these studies aimed to ﬁnd all plau-
sible sensitivities. However, concerted efforts from the nu-

6

SUBEDI, MEISEL, & MERZ

clear physics community have reduced the uncertainties for
several reaction rates well below two orders of magnitude
uncertainty. Furthermore, decades of comparison between
measured data and Hauser-Feshbach calculations have shown
that nuclear reactions proceeding through compound nuclei
at relatively high nuclear level densities have theoretical pre-
dictions generally within an order of magnitude of measure-
ments (see e.g. Mohr (2015)). As such, we aimed to adopt
more realistic rate variation factors, taking into account ex-
isting experimental and theoretical data.

Reaction rate variation factors used here are given in Ta-
ble 2. When experimental data were available over the as-
trophysically relevant energies or a reaction rate evaluation
existed, the uncertainty from that work was used as the rate
variation factor. In the absence of such information, the rate
was either assigned an uncertainty factor of 10 or 100, de-
pending on whether or not the Hauser-Feshbach formalism
was thought to be valid, following the approach of Cyburt
et al. (2016).

For Hauser-Feshbach validity, we adopt the heuristic that
more than ten nuclear levels must exist within an MeV of the
excitation energy populated in the compound nucleus for a
particular reaction (Wagoner 1969; Rauscher et al. 1997). To
determine the relevant excitation energy, we use the Gamow
window approximation for the center of mass reaction energy
of astrophysical interest (Rolfs & Rodney 1988):

EG = 0.1220

where Zi are the proton numbers of the two reactants, Ai

gigakelvin, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The 1/e width
of the window about EG is

∆G = 4

MeV.

(7)

While more accurate methods exist to determine the ex-
citation energy window of astrophysical interest (Newton
et al. 2007; Rauscher 2010), we chose the more approxi-
mate Gamow window method given the uncertainty of nu-
clear level structure for the nuclides involved and the choice
of a single temperature for which to calculate the energies of
astrophysical interest.

We calculated the Gamow window at T9 = 4 as this is
where the calculations of Magkotsios et al. (2010) fall out of
QSE. We determined whether at the bottom of the window
(EG − ∆G/2) more than 10 nuclear levels per MeV of ex-
citation were present, based on the microscopic nuclear level
densities calculated by Goriely et al. (2008). For high level-
density cases, we consider a reaction to be in the statistical
regime and assign an uncertainty factor of 10, based on the
typical spread in predictions from Hauser-Feshbach calcula-
tions (e.g. Pereira & Montes 2016). For low level-density
cases, we consider a reaction to be in the resonant regime
and assign an uncertainty factor of 100, based on the signiﬁ-
cant rate modiﬁcation that can occur due addition/removal of
a particular resonance or change in a key resonance’s proper-
ties (e.g. Cavanna et al. 2015).

6. SENSITIVITY STUDY RESULTS

Figures 4, 5, and 6 show the sensitivity study results for
44Ti, 56Ni, and 44Ti/56Ni, respectively, for all combinations
of Mprog, Einj, and Mcut modeled here, where the reaction
numbers correspond to the designations in Table 2 and the
reported ratios are to the baseline results of Table 1. In each
plot the upper panel corresponds to a reaction rate increase,
while the bottom panel corresponds to a reaction rate de-
crease. We show the sensitivities for various combinations of
Einj and Mcut to give a sense of the robustness of our results
to changes in model assumptions. However, for the ensuing
discussion we limit ourselves to the results for Mcut = M4.
In the following we separately discuss reactions impact-
ing 44Ti, 56Ni, and their ratio. Motivated by typical ob-
servational uncertainties (discussed in Section 4), we only
discuss cases (listed in Table 3) that affect these yields by
a factor of two or more for at least one set of model condi-
tions, as we deem this to be signiﬁcant for model-observation
comparisons. Of course as observations improve, it is likely
that even smaller sensitivities will be of interest in the future.
Note that in general we see fewer reaction rate variations hav-
ing a signiﬁcant impact for larger Mprog calculations. This
is because, for those cases, much of the 44Ti and 56Ni be-
yond Mcut was synthesized during stellar evolution at radii

not signiﬁcantly impacted by the outgoing shock (Chiefﬁ &
Limongi 2017).

(cid:17)

The explanations we provide for the sensitivities we ob-
serve are based on analyzing the ﬂow in the nuclear reaction
network (see Figure 7), along with guidance from the discus-
sions in The et al. (1998) and Magkotsios et al. (2010). The
ﬂow for converting isotope i to isotope j over a timestep is
Fij = (cid:82) (cid:16) ˙Yi→j − ˙Yj→i
dt, where ˙Yi→j is the rate that the
abundance of isotope i is depleted by reactions converting i
to j. As shown in Figure 1, the relevant conditions for this
work are primarily those known as α-rich and silicon-rich
freeze-out. For silicon-rich conditions (Region A), nucle-
osynthesis yields are mostly characterized by nuclear masses
and the initial abundances before the explosion, with some
ﬂow between many small QSE clusters. For α-rich freeze-
out (Region D), much larger QSE clusters are formed ini-
tially and a signiﬁcant excess of α-particles are available.
In that case nucleosynthesis is characterized by the ﬂow be-
tween these large QSE clusters and the fusion of α-particles
into heavier nuclides with Z = 2n, A = 4n, where n is
an integer. Therefore, our reaction rate sensitivities fall into
three categories: those inﬂuencing the helium burning, those
near boundaries of the large QSE clusters that exist in α-rich
freeze-out at early times, and those near 44Ti that can inﬂu-
ence nucleosynthesis as that QSE cluster dissolves into many
smaller QSE clusters.

6.1. Reactions impacting 44Ti

Here we discuss reactions listed in Table 3 that signif-
icantly impact M (44Ti), working from light to heavy nu-
clides.

13N(α, p)16O and 27Al(α, n)30P each inﬂuence M (44Ti)
for a subset of conditions, where a rate increase of the for-
mer reduces 44Ti yields, while an in increase of the latter
increases M (44Ti). Each is a prominent helium-burning re-
action in our network ﬂow. However, the lack of consistency
in inﬂuence across Mprog and Einj demonstrates a clear de-
pendence on the adopted model conditions.

39K(p, γ)40Ca and 39K(p, α)36Ar signiﬁcantly impact
M (44Ti) across almost all sets of model conditions. This
is due to the importance of the reaction sequence 39K(p, γ)
40Ca(α, γ)44Ti. Increasing 39K(p, γ)40Ca clearly enhances
M (44Ti), whereas 39K(p, α)36Ar competes as an alternative
reaction path, reducing M (44Ti). In each case, a reaction
rate decrease has the opposite effect.

42Ca(p, γ)43Sc is generally well-constrained enough so as
to not impact 44Ti nucleosynthesis. However, for the 22 M(cid:12)
high-Einj case, decreasing this reaction rate signiﬁcantly en-
hances M (44Ti). The connection of 42Ca to 44Ti along the
reaction network is not as straight forward as one might as-
sume, since 43Sc(γ, p)42Ca dwarfs the forward reaction at
the relevant temperatures. The inﬂuence of decreasing the
42Ca(p, γ)43Sc reaction rate is to reduce competition with
42Ca(α, n)45Ti. The latter reaction enhances M (44Ti) since
the abundances across titanium isotopes will be redistributed

according to (n, γ)−(γ, n) equilibrium until the environment
has cooled and nucleosynthesis has essentially ceased.

An increase in the 43Sc(α, p)46Ti rate was found to en-
hance M (44Ti) only for the 15 M(cid:12) high-Einj case, where
the presumed connection to 44Ti is as described in the pre-
vious paragraph for 42Ca(α, n)45Ti. Following the reac-
tion network ﬂow of Figure 7 also reveals the connection
43Sc(α, p)46Ti(p, γ)47V(p, α)44Ti.

47V(p, γ)48Cr signiﬁcantly impacts M (44Ti) for most of
the model conditions explored. This reaction competes with
47V(p, α)44Ti, instead bridging the QSE leakage from QSE
cluster 2 to QSE-3 (see Figure 7). Therefore, an increase in
the 47V(p, γ)48Cr rate decreases M (44Ti), while a reaction
rate decrease has the opposite effect.

48Cr(α, p)51Mn can be a part of the bridge connecting
QSE-2 to QSE-3 and therefore an increase in this reac-
tion rate decreases M (44Ti) for low Mprog cases. How-
ever, when using the nominal 48Cr(α, p)51Mn reaction rate,
48Cr(n, p)48V plays a more signiﬁcant role bridging QSE-2
to QSE-3, and so a reaction rate decrease has little impact.

After the sequence 48V(p, γ)49Cr(p, n)49V(p, γ)50Cr(p, γ)

51Mn(n, p)51Cr(p, γ)52Mn, 52Mn(p, γ)53Fe is near the up-
per end of the bridge between QSE-2 and QSE-3. As such,
increasing this reaction rate decreases M (44Ti), while de-
creasing the rate has the opposite effect, though our threshold
for signiﬁcance is only crossed for one set of model condi-
tions.

Figure 5. Same as Figure 4 but for M (56Ni).

The impact of 52Fe(α, p)55Co signiﬁcantly depends on the
adopted model conditions, alternately enhancing or reducing
M (44Ti) from a reaction rate increase. In Region A, where
the majority of the low-Mprog low-Einj mass zones are lo-
cated, 52Fe is expected to be one of the primary freeze-out
nuclides (Magkotsios et al. 2010), and so it is sensible that
for these cases increasing the 52Fe(α, p)55Co reaction rate
will move the reaction network ﬂow away from 44Ti. How-
ever, for Region D, in which higher T0 are experienced and
(γ, p) reactions will play a more prominent role, enhancing
52Fe(α, p)55Co ultimately leads to more signiﬁcant ﬂow to-
ward 44Ti. This case highlights the complexities of nuclear
reaction network ﬂows in high-temperature environments.

54Fe(α, p)57Co is quite well constrained experimentally
and variations within the present uncertainty are largely
inconsequential for 44Ti nucleosynthesis. However, a de-
crease in this reaction rate signiﬁcantly enhances M (44Ti)
for the highest Mprog calculation.
This is likely due

to the increased competition from the reaction sequence
54Fe(p, α)51Mn(γ, p)50Cr(p, α)47V(p, α)44Ti.

As with 52Fe(α, p)55Co, the inﬂuence of 55Co(α, p)58Ni
on M (44Ti) depends strongly on the model conditions, hav-
ing the same relative inﬂuence as the former reaction for a
reaction rate increase.

The majority of the remaining reactions on isotopes of
cobalt and nickel inﬂuence M (44Ti) as might be expected,
with reactions moving toward 44Ti enhancing its abun-
dance and reactions moving away decreasing it. These in-
clude 56Co(p, n)56Ni, 56Ni(α, p)59Cu, and 57Ni(n, p)57Co.
On the other hand, an increase of the 57Co(p, γ)58Ni re-
action rate increases M (44Ti). This somewhat counter-
intuitive result is apparently due to the ﬂow connecting
58Ni to 44Ti via 54Fe. Speciﬁcally, the reaction sequence
58Ni(γ, n)57Ni(γ, p)56Co(γ, p)55Fe(γ, n)54Fe

44Ti as described in the preceding paragraph discussing
54Fe(α, p)57Co.

anti-correlated, two non-signiﬁcant sensitivities can combine
to form a signiﬁcant impact on the ratio M (44Ti)/M (56Ni).
As this ratio is considered a distinct diagnostic for model-
observation comparisons (e.g. Wongwathanarat et al. 2017),
we separately highlight these reaction rate sensitivities in Ta-
ble 3.

7. DISCUSSION

It is interesting to compare the results of the present work
to previous studies exploring nuclear reaction rate sensitivi-
ties of shock-driven nucleosynthesis. In particular, we focus
our discussion on the post-processing studies of The et al.
(1998) and Magkotsios et al. (2010), as these studies also ex-
plored the impact of individual reaction rate variations for
a large number of rates. The pioneering work of The et al.
(1998) used an exponential temperature and density trajec-
tory (see Equation 2) with T0 = 5.5 GK, ρ0 = 107 g cm−3,
Ye = 0.497 and 0.499, and reaction rate variation factors
of 100. Magkotsios et al. (2010) expanded on this work,
exploring reaction rate sensitivities with rate variation fac-
tors of 100 for exponential and power law trajectories (see
Equation 3), a large phase space of T0–ρ0 (see Figure 1), and
Ye = 0.48 − 0.52. In comparison, our model calculations
have average Ye = 0.498 − 0.499, thermodynamic trajecto-
ries more closely resembling the power-law forms, with mass
zones covering the T0–ρ0 phase-space as shown in Figure 1,
and focused mostly on the strong reactions identiﬁed as im-
portant by Magkotsios et al. (2010) using rate variation fac-
tors informed by the literature.

While our list of inﬂuential reactions shares several sim-
ilarities with previous works, there are some conspicuous
differences. In particular, we do not highlight many of the
reactions that both prior studies identiﬁed as high-impact4,
namely, 40Ca(α, γ)44Ti, 44Ti(α, p)47V, 45V(p, γ)46Cr, and
57Ni(p, γ)58Cu. For each of these reactions, the likely expla-
nation is that we used far smaller rate variation factors (see
Table 2). For the ﬁrst two in this set, this is based on the sig-
niﬁcant efforts in the nuclear physics community to reduce
these reaction rate uncertainties. For the latter two, our re-
duced rate variation factors (10 as opposed to 100) are based
on the presumed accuracy of Hauser-Feshbach reaction rate
predictions given the high nuclear level densities involved.

Our relative insensitivity to variations in the 40Ca(α, γ)44Ti
and 44Ti(α, p)47V rates when using experimentally con-
strained uncertainties5 is in agreement with Hoffman et al.
(2010) who sampled a slightly lower ρ0 region of the thermo-

4 Here, we consider Table 4 of The et al. (1998) and reactions designated

as “primary” in Table 3 of Magkotsios et al. (2010).

5 We performed test calculations using a rate variation factor of 100
for these two rates with Mprog = 15 M(cid:12) Einj = 1.32 foe, and found
M (44Ti) variations similar to Figure 14 of Magkotsios et al. (2010).

Figure 7. Reaction network ﬂow for Mprog = 15 M(cid:12) with Einj =
1.32 foe 0.06 seconds after the completion of energy deposition.
Forward reaction rate ﬂow is shown by black arrows, while the red
arrows represent the reverse reaction ﬂow. We refer to (p, γ), (p, n),
(α, γ), (α, p), and (α, n) as “forward”. Three QSE regions that are
present early in the calculation are identiﬁed in the reaction ﬂow.
Note that these begin as a single large QSE cluster and dissolve into
many smaller QSE clusters.

6.2. Reactions impacting 56Ni

Here we discuss the reactions listed in Table 3 that signiﬁ-
cantly impact M (56Ni). As highlighted by Magkotsios et al.
(2010), 56Ni nucleosynthesis is far less sensitive to nuclear
reaction rate variations than 44Ti because it is much nearer
to the global minimum in the nuclear binding energy surface.
We ﬁnd sensitivities for nuclear reaction rates impacting the
ﬂow into the large QSE cluster at early times and into the
small QSE cluster present around 56Ni at late times.

For α-rich freeze-out conditions, the 3α→12C reaction
contributes ﬂow to the single large QSE cluster that is ini-
tially present, driving the formation of the cluster QSE-
1 (Magkotsios et al. 2010). 13N(α, p)16O, 17F(α, p)20Ne,
and 27Al(α, p)30Si all moderate ﬂow from the QSE-1 clus-
ter to higher-mass nuclides. This has a signiﬁcant impact on
M (56Ni) for a subset of our model calculations. For each
of these reactions, an increase in the reaction rate decreases
56Ni yields.

The 57Ni(n, p)57Co reaction drives material away from the
nickel isotopes towards lower mass nuclides when the large
QSE cluster in this region has dissolved. Therefore, increas-
ing this reaction rate decreases M (56Ni) for a subset of the
model conditions.

6.3. Reactions impacting 44Ti/56Ni

Inspecting Table 3 reveals several reactions which im-
pact M (44Ti) and/or M (56Ni) for some set of model con-
ditions, but not above our pre-speciﬁed signiﬁcance thresh-
old. However, as the impacts on the two yields are often

dynamic phase space with models of CasA from Magkotsios
et al. (2008). They found that remaining uncertainties in
40Ca(α, γ)44Ti contribute a ∼ 20% variation to X(44Ti),
while 44Ti(α, p)47V uncertainties (estimated there as a fac-
tor of 3) lead to a 70% variation. Similarly, Tur et al. (2010)
found the 3α→12C and 12C(α, γ)16O reactions are sufﬁ-
ciently constrained from the standpoint of 44Ti CCSN nu-
cleosynthesis.

For the remaining high-impact cases of Magkotsios et al.
(2010), the sensitivity identiﬁed in their work is for a re-
gion of phase space that our models did not populate.
For 17F(α, p)20Ne, 21Na(α, p)24Mg, and 40Ca(α, p)43Sc,
Magkotsios et al. (2010) only ﬁnd a signiﬁcant impact for
relatively proton-rich initial conditions. For 41Sc(p, γ)42Ti
and 44Ti(p, γ)45V, Magkotsios et al. (2010) observe signif-
icant variations of X(44Ti) only for quite high-T0 low-ρ0
conditions.

Indeed the signiﬁcant reaction rate sensitivities that we
identify in Table 2 are all highlighted as of secondary impor-
tance by Magkotsios et al. (2010). However, since their “sec-
ondary” designation is a general term for less than a factor of
10 variation in X(44Ti) for any region within their full T0–ρ0
phase space, a quantitative comparison is not possible. Qual-
itatively, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant sensitivity in M (44Ti) and/or
M (44Ti)/M (56Ni) for the majority of (α, p) and (p, γ) re-
actions identiﬁed by Magkotsios et al. (2010) as impacting
the chasm depth, and a subset of the (p, n) reactions found
to impact the chasm width. The connection of our results to
the chasm are not surprising, as all of our model calculations
have mass zones very near to or directly over this region.

Perhaps more interesting are the reaction rate sensitivi-
ties that we ﬁnd in our work which were not identiﬁed by
Magkotsios et al. (2010). We included 39K(p, α)36Ar and
27Al(α, n)30P as a test of the completeness of the previous
survey, ﬁnding signiﬁcant sensitivities for some choices of
model conditions. This is not entirely unexpected, as The
et al. (1998) identiﬁed 27Al(α, n)30P and 36Ar(α, p)39K,
the reverse of 39K(p, α)36Ar, as inﬂuential for some choices
of Ye. Nonetheless, this highlights the need for larger-scale
reaction rate sensitivity studies for shock-driven nucleosyn-
thesis using one-dimensional models.

8. CONCLUSIONS

We performed nuclear reaction rate sensitivity studies for
44Ti and 56Ni production in CCSN shock-driven nucleosyn-
thesis using the code MESA. We evolved a range of Mprog
stars to core collapse and induced an artiﬁcal explosion with
a range of Einj, analyzing nucleosynthesis yields for a range
of Mcut, in order to gauge the robustness of our results to
model calculation assumptions. For each set of model as-
sumptions, we varied the strong reactions previously identi-
ﬁed by Magkotsios et al. (2010) as inﬂuential for 44Ti pro-
duction, including two additional rates to test the complete-
ness of the inﬂuential reaction rate set, using reaction rate
variation factors based on uncertainty constraints in the liter-
ature.

We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant impact on 44Ti and/or 56Ni nucle-
osynthesis for only a subset of the inﬂuential reaction rates of
Magkotsios et al. (2010), though this is likely attributable to
the smaller reaction rate variation factors and different astro-
physical conditions used in our work. Additionally, we ﬁnd
nucleosynthesis sensitivities for reaction rates not identiﬁed
by Magkotsios et al. (2010). This indicates that larger-scale
reaction rate sensitivity studies exploring an expanded set of
reaction rates is desirable.

From the present work we conclude that additional effort is
required from the nuclear physics community to reduced the
reaction rate uncertainties for 13N(α, p)16O, 17F(α, p)20Ne,
27Al(α, p)30Si, 43Sc(α, p)46Ti, 48Cr(α, p)51Mn, 52Fe(α, p)55Co,
54Fe(α, p)57Co, 55Co(α, p)58Ni, 56Ni(α, p)59Cu, 57Ni(n, p)57Co,
56Co(p, n)56Ni, 39K(p, γ)40Ca, 42Ca(p, γ)43Sc, 47V(p, γ)48Cr,
52Mn(p, γ)53Fe, 57Co(p, γ)58Ni, 27Al(α, n)30P, and 39K(p, α)36Ar.
