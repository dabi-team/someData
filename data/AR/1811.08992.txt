The Differential Graded Stable Category of a
Self-Injective Algebra

Jeremy R. B. Brightbill

July 17, 2019

Abstract

Let A be a ﬁnite-dimensional, self-injective algebra, graded in non-
positive degree. We deﬁne A -dgstab, the differential graded stable category
of A, to be the quotient of the bounded derived category of dg-modules by
the thick subcategory of perfect dg-modules. We express A -dgstab as the
triangulated hull of the orbit category A -grstab /Ω(1). This result allows
computations in the dg-stable category to be performed by reducing to the
graded stable category. We provide a sufﬁcient condition for the orbit cat-
egory to be equivalent to A -dgstab and show this condition is satisﬁed by
Nakayama algebras and Brauer tree algebras. We also provide a detailed de-
scription of the dg-stable category of the Brauer tree algebra corresponding
to the star with n edges.

1 Introduction

If A is a self-injective k-algebra, then A -stab, the stable module category of A,
admits the structure of a triangulated category. This category has two equivalent
descriptions. The original description is as an additive quotient: One begins with
the category of A-modules and sets all morphisms factoring through projective
modules to zero. More categorically, we deﬁne A -stab to be the quotient of ad-
ditive categories A -mod /A -proj. The second description, due to Rickard [13],
describes A -stab as a quotient of triangulated categories. Rickard obtains A -stab
as the quotient of the bounded derived category of A by the thick subcategory
of perfect complexes (i.e., complexes quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex
of projective modules). Once this result is known, the triangulated structure on

A -stab is an immediate consequence of the theory of triangulated categories.
When translated back into the additive description, the homological shift functor
[−1] inherited from Db(A -mod) becomes identiﬁed with the Heller loop functor
Ω, which maps each module to the kernel of a projective cover. The triangu-
lated description provides a well-behaved technical framework for transferring
information between A -stab and the derived category, while the additive descrip-
tion allows computations of morphisms to be performed in A -mod rather than
Db(A -mod). If A is made into a graded algebra, analogous constructions pro-
duce two equivalent descriptions of the graded stable category A -grstab.

If A is a dg-algebra, we use the triangulated description to deﬁne the differen-
tial graded stable category A -dgstab. More precisely, A -dgstab is deﬁned to be
the quotient of the derived category Db
dg(A) of dg-modules by the thick subcate-
gory of perfect dg-modules.

The most immediately interesting feature of the dg-stable category is the pres-
ence of non-trivial interactions between the grading data and the triangulated
structure. In Db
dg(A), the grading shift functor coincides with the homological
shift functor, and so in A -dgstab the grading shift functor (−1) can be identiﬁed
with Ω. This phenomenon does not occur in the graded stable category, since the
grading shift and homological shift functors in Db(A -grmod) are distinct.

However, working with dg-modules introduces new complications. The pres-
ence of dg-modules which do not arise from complexes of graded modules is an
obstacle to obtaining a simple additive deﬁnition of A -dgstab, without which
computation of morphisms becomes much harder, as it must be done in the trian-
gulated setting. In this paper we consider the problem of ﬁnding a simple additive
description of A -dgstab.

The dg-stable category has been studied by Keller [8], using the machinery
of orbit categories; our approach is motivated by his work.
In Section 3, we
consider the case where A is a non-positively graded, ﬁnite-dimensional, self-
injective algebra, viewed as a dg-algebra with zero differential. There is a natural
functor A -grstab → A -dgstab which is faithful but not full. This is due to the
fact that X ∼= ΩX(1) for all X ∈ A -dgstab; the corresponding isomorphism
almost never holds in A -grstab. To recover the missing morphisms, we turn
to the orbit category C(A) := A -grstab /Ω(1). The objects of C(A) are those
of A -grstab, and the morphisms X → Y are ﬁnite formal sums of morphisms
X → ΩnY (n) in A -grstab. Orbit categories need not be triangulated, but Keller
proves they can always be included inside a ”triangulated hull”. We shall construct
a fully faithful functor FA : C(A) → A -dgstab whose image generates A -dgstab
as a triangulated category and show that A -dgstab is the triangulated hull of C(A).

2

FA is an equivalence of categories precisely when it identiﬁes C(A) with a
triangulated subcategory of A -dgstab. This is in general not the case, as there
is no natural way to take the cone of a formal sum of morphisms with differ-
ent codomains. In Section 4, we provide a sufﬁcient condition for FA to be an
equivalence and show that this condition is satisﬁed by self-injective Nakayama
algebras. An example for which FA is not an equivalence is also provided.

In the second half of this paper, we investigate the dg-stable category of non-
positively graded Brauer tree algebras. A Brauer tree is the data of a tree, a cyclic
ordering of the edges around each vertex, a marked vertex (called the exceptional
vertex) and a positive integer multiplicity associated to the exceptional vertex. The
data of a Brauer tree determines, up to Morita equivalence, an algebra whose com-
position factors reﬂect the combinatorial data of the tree. We refer to Schroll [15]
for a detailed introduction to the theory of Brauer tree algebras and their appear-
ance in group theory, geometry, and homological algebra, but we mention here
one application which is of particular relevance. Khovanov and Seidel [10] link
the category Db
dg(A), where A is a graded Brauer tree algebra on the the line with
n vertices, to the triangulated subcategory of the Fukaya category generated by a
chain of knotted Lagrangian spheres. The braid group acts on Db
dg(A) by auto-
morphisms, and the category A -dgstab can be viewed as the quotient of Db
dg(A)
by this action.

In Section 5, we show that C(A) is equivalent to A -dgstab for any Brauer tree
algebra, and in Section 6 we provide a detailed description of A -dgstab when A
corresponds to the star with n edges and multiplicity one.

This paper was motivated by the work of Chuang and Rouquier [4], who, for a
symmetric algebra A, deﬁne an action on a set of parametrized tilting complexes
in Db(A). Collections of simple A-modules act on the tilting complexes via appli-
cation of perverse equivalences. Placing a non-positive grading on A, this action
can be deﬁned in the dg-stable category, leading to interesting combinatorial in-
teractions between the grading data of the algebra and the homological structure
of the module category. We shall describe the structure of this action when A is a
Brauer tree algebra in an upcoming work; the detailed computations in Section 6
serve as the foundation of this effort.

2 Notation and Deﬁnitions

2.1 Triangulated Categories

A triangulated category is the data of an additive category T , an automorphism
[1] of T (called the suspension or shift), and a family of distinguished triangles
X → Y → Z → X[1] obeying certain axioms. For more details on the deﬁnition
and theory of triangulated categories, see Neeman [11].
In a triangulated category, any morphism X

f
−→ Y can be completed to a
f
−→ Y → Z → X[1]. We refer to Z as a cone of f ; it is unique up
triangle X
to non-canonical isomorphism. Abusing notation, for any morphism f : X → Y
in a triangulated category T , we shall write C(f ) to refer to any choice of object
f
−→ Y → C(f ) → X[1]. This will cause no confusion.
completing the triangle X
An additive functor F : T1 → T2 is said to be exact or triangulated if it com-
mutes with the shift functor and preserves distinguished triangles. A full additive
subcategory I of T is called triangulated if it is closed under isomorphisms,
shifts, and cones. A triangulated subcategory I of T is thick if I is closed under
direct summands. Given a thick subcategory, one can form the quotient category
T /I by localizing at the class of morphisms whose cone lies in I. There is a
natural functor T → T /I which is essentially surjective and whose kernel is I.

2.2 Complexes

If A is any additive category, we write Comp(A) for the category of (cochain)
complexes over A. We shall write our complexes as (C •, d•
C : C n →
C n+1 for all n ∈ Z. We write Ho(A) for the category of complexes and mor-
phisms taken modulo homotopy. If A is an abelian category, we let D(A) denote
the derived category of A. On any of these subcategories, we shall use the su-
perscript b (resp., +, −) to denote the full, replete subcategory generated by the
bounded (resp., bounded below, bounded above) complexes.

C), where dn

If A = A -mod for some algebra A, we shall write Hoperf (A -mod) (resp.,
Dperf (A -mod)) for the thick subcategory of Ho(A -mod) (resp., D(A -mod))
generated by A. The objects are those complexes which are homotopy equivalent
(resp., quasi-isomorphic) to bounded complexes of projective modules; we refer
to them as the strictly perfect (resp., perfect) complexes.

On any of the above categories, we let [n] denote the n-th shift functor, de-
C. We write H n(C •) for the n-th

ﬁned by (C •[n])i = C i+n and d•

C[n] = (−1)nd•

C ).

Given a morphism of complexes f : X • → Y •, we deﬁne the cone of f to be

the complex C(f )• = X •[1] ⊕ Y • with differential

−→ Y → C(f ) → X[1] in Ho(A).

We write τ≤n, τ≥n, τ<n, τ>n for the truncation functors on D(A) deﬁned by the
canonical t-structure. More explicitly, if X • is a complex, the kth term of τ≤nX •
is X k if k < n, 0 if k > n, and ker(dn
X) if k = n. τ>nX • is deﬁned analogously;
here the nth term equal to im(dn
X). We also denote by X ≤n the complex whose
kth term is X k for k ≤ n and 0 for k > n. We denote X ≥n, X <n, X >n similarly,
and refer to these complexes as the sharp truncations of X •.

2.3 Modules and the Stable Category

If A is an algebra over a ﬁeld k, we let A -mod denote the category of ﬁnitely
generated right A-modules, and let A -proj denote the full subcategory of ﬁnitely
generated projective modules. A-Mod and A-Proj will denote the categories of all
modules and projective modules, respectively.

Given an A-module X, we deﬁne the socle of X, soc(X) to be the sum of all
simple submodules X. We deﬁne the radical of X, rad(X), to be the intersection
of all maximal submodules of X, and we deﬁne the head of X to be the quotient
hd(X) = X/rad(X). We note that rad(A), where A is viewed as a right module
over itself, is equal to the Jacobson radical of A. If X is ﬁnitely generated, then
rad(X) = Xrad(A).

An algebra A is said to be self-injective if A is injective as a right A-module.
In a self-injective algebra, the classes of ﬁnitely-generated projective and injective
modules coincide. A is said to be symmetric if there is a linear map λ : A → k
such that ker(λ) contains no left or right ideals of A, and λ(ab) = λ(ba) for all
a, b ∈ A. All symmetric algebras are self-injective.

We let A -stab denote the stable module category of A. The objects of
A -stab are the objects of A -mod, and HomA -stab(X, Y ) is deﬁned to be the quo-
tient of HomA -mod(X, Y ) by the subspace of morphisms factoring through pro-
jective modules. There is a full, essentially surjective functor A -mod ։ A -stab
which is the identity on objects. If A is self-injective, then A -stab admits the
structure of a triangulated category, and it has been shown by Rickard [13] that
A -stab is equivalent as a triangulated category to Db(A -mod)/Dperf(A -mod).
For a more detailed introduction to the theory of ﬁnite-dimensional algebras,

5

see for instance Benson [1].

We say that an additive category C is a Krull-Schmidt category if every object
in C is isomorphic to a ﬁnite direct sum of objects with local endomorphism rings.
If A is ﬁnite-dimensional, both A -mod and A -stab are Krull-Schmidt. Any
indecomposable object of A -stab is the image of an indecomposable object in
A -mod.

2.4 Graded Modules

Let A be a graded algebra over a ﬁeld k. We denote by A -grmod (resp., A -grproj)
the category of ﬁnitely generated graded right modules (resp., ﬁnitely generated
graded projective right modules). We shall use upper case letters when the mod-
ules are not required to be ﬁnitely generated, in analogy with Section 2.3.

The graded stable module category A -grstab can be deﬁned analogously to
A -stab. When A is self-injective, we once again have that A -grstab is triangu-
lated and equivalent to Db(A -grmod)/Dperf (A -grmod).

If X is a graded A-module, we write X i to denote the homogenous component
of X in degree i. (If X • is a complex of graded modules, we shall denote the
degree i component of the nth term of the complex by (X n)i.) On any category
of graded objects, we deﬁne the grading shift functor (n) by X(n)i = X i+n. If
x ∈ X is a homogeneous element, we let |x| denote the degree of x.

For a graded module X, we deﬁne the support of X to be the set supp(X) =
{n ∈ Z|X n 6= 0}. We also deﬁne max(X) = sup(supp(X)) and min(X) =
inf (supp(X)). Note that if A is ﬁnite-dimensional and X is a ﬁnitely gener-
ated nonzero A-module, then X is a ﬁnite-dimensional k-vector space, therefore
supp(X) is a ﬁnite, nonempty set and max(X) and min(X) are ﬁnite.

Given graded modules X and Y , deﬁne Hom•

A -grmod(X, Y ) to be the graded
vector space whose degree n component is the space HomA -grmod(X, Y (n)) of
degree n morphisms. If X is a graded left B-module for some graded algebra B,
then Hom•

A -grmod(X, Y ) is a graded right B-module.

2.5 Differential Graded Modules

A differential graded algebra is a pair (A, dA), where A is a graded k-algebra
and dA is a degree 1 k-linear differential which satisﬁes, for all homogenous a, b ∈
A, the equation dA(ab) = dA(a)b + (−1)|a|adA(b) .

If (A, dA) is a differential graded k-algebra, a differential graded right A-
module (or dg-module, for short) is a pair (X, dX) consisting of a graded right A-

6

module X and a degree 1 k-linear differential dX : X → X satisfying dX (xa) =
dX(x)a + (−1)|x|xdA(a) for all homogeneous elements x ∈ X, a ∈ A. A
morphism of differential graded modules is deﬁned to be a homomorphism of
graded A modules which commutes with the differential. We denote by A -dgmod
the category of ﬁnitely-generated right dg-modules. As above, we shall write
A -dgMod for the category of arbitrary dg-modules.

As with complexes, we write H i(X) for the ith cohomology group of X, i.e.

the degree i component of ker(dX)/im(dX).

Any graded algebra A can be viewed as a differential graded algebra with zero
differential. In this case, for any dg-module (X, dX), dX is a degree 1 morphism
of graded modules, and so the kernel and image of dX are dg-submodules of X
with zero differential. In this paper, we shall work exclusively with dg-algebras
with zero differential.

For dg-modules, we deﬁne the grading shift functor (n) : A -dgMod →

A -dgMod by (X, dX)(n) = (X(n), dX(n)), where dX(n) = (−1)ndX(n).

There is a faithful functor

X) to the dg-module (

n∈Z X n(−n) and whose differential d bX restricts to dn

If f, g : X → Y are morphisms of dg-modules, we say f and g are homotopic
if there is a degree −1 graded morphism h : X → Y such that f − g = h ◦
dX + dY ◦ h. We write Hodg(A) for the category of left dg-modules over A and
homotopy classes of morphisms. By formally inverting the quasi-isomorphisms of
Hodg(A), we obtain Ddg(A), the derived category of dg-modules. We again use
the superscript b (resp., +, −) to denote the full subcategory whose objects are
isomorphic to dg-modules with bounded (resp. bounded below, bounded above)
support. We write Hoperf
(A)) for the thick subcategories of
Hob
dg(A)) generated by the dg-module A. We refer to the objects of
Hoperf
(A)) as the strictly perfect (resp., perfect) dg-modules.

If P is strictly perfect, then for any dg-module X, we have an isomorphism
HomHodg(A)(P, X) ∼= HomDdg(A)(P, X). In addition, if A is a ﬁnite-dimensional,
self-injective graded algebra with zero differential, then HomHodg(A)(X, P ) ∼=
HomDdg(A)(X, P ). Any perfect dg-module is quasi-isomorphic to a strictly perfect

2.6 Functors and Resolutions

Let A be a ﬁnite-dimensional, self-injective graded algebra.

Let m : Aop ⊗k A ։ A denote the multiplication map, viewed as a mor-
phism of graded (Aop ⊗k A)-modules, and let I = ker(m). We deﬁne the func-
tor Ω := − ⊗A I : A -grmod → A -grmod. Note that Ω has a right adjoint
Ω′ := Hom•

A -grmod(I, −).

Since I is projective both as a right and left A-module, we have that Ω is ex-
act and Ω(A -grproj) ⊂ A -grproj. Thus Ω lifts to Db(A -grmod) and descends
to A -grstab; we also have that Ω(Dperf (A -grmod)) ⊂ Dperf (A -grmod). The
complex P • = 0 → I ֒→ Aop ⊗k A ։ A → 0 is an exact complex of pro-
jective right A-modules, hence is homotopy equivalent to zero. Then for any
X ∈ A -grmod, we have that X ⊗A P • is homotopy equivalent to zero, hence
exact. But X ⊗A P • ∼= 0 → ΩX ֒→ X ⊗k A ։ X → 0, hence ΩX is the
kernel of a surjection from a projective right A-module onto X. Thus Ω is an au-
toequivalence of A -grstab and is isomorphic to the desuspension functor for the
triangulated structure. In A -grstab, ΩX is isomorphic to the kernel of a projective
cover of X.

Similarly, for any complex X • ∈ Compb(A -grmod), we have a short exact
sequence of complexes 0 → Ω(X •) ֒→ X • ⊗k A ։ X • → 0. From the resulting

8

triangle in Db(A -grmod), we obtain a natural transformation [−1] → Ω. Since
X • ⊗k A ∈ Dperf (A -grmod), this natural transformation descends to a natural
isomorphism [−1] → Ω in A -grstab ∼= Db(A -grmod)/Dperf(A -grmod).

By a similar argument, Ω deﬁnes a functor A -dgmod → A -dgmod which is
dg(A) and preserves
(A), and so Ω descends to A -dgstab. We also have a natural transformation
dg(A) which descends to an isomorphism in

exact and preserves direct summands of A. Thus Ω lifts to Db
Dperf
dg
(−1) → Ω of endofunctors of Db
A -dgstab.

Similarly, Ω′ is exact and preserves projective modules, and so descends to
dg(A). Since Ω′ is right

A -grstab and A -dgstab and lifts to Db(A -grmod) and Db
adjoint to Ω, we have that Ω′ is quasi-inverse to Ω in A -grstab and A -dgstab.

2.7 Dg-categories

We give a brief introduction to the terminology and machinery of dg-categories.
For more details, the reader may consult Keller [9].

A differential graded category or dg-category over a ﬁeld k is a category
enriched over k -dgMod. A dg-functor between two dg-categories is a functor
of categories enriched over k -dgMod. Thus morphism spaces in a dg-category
have a natural structure of complexes of k-vector spaces, and dg-functors induce
morphisms of complexes on these Hom spaces. Let dgcatk denote the category of
all small dg-categories over the ﬁeld k.

Given a dg-category A, we deﬁne the homotopy category of A to be the
category H 0(A) whose objects are the objects of A and whose morphsms are
given by HomH 0(A)(X, Y ) := H 0(HomA(X, Y )). Similarly, we deﬁne Z 0(A) to
be the category with the same objects whose morphisms are the closed degree 0
morphisms of A.

A dg-functor F : A → B is called a quasi-equivalence if F induces quasi-

9

isomorphisms on all morphism spaces and H 0(F ) : H 0(A) → H 0(B) is an equiv-
alence. By inverting the quasi-equivalences in dgcatk, we obtain the homotopy
category of dg-categories, denoted Ho(dgcatk).

−

L

Deﬁne the dg-category of dg k-modules k -dgModdg as follows: The ob-
jects of k -dgModdg are the differential graded k-modules. The degree n piece
i Homk(X i, Y i+n), and the differential is given by
of Homk -dgModdg(X, Y ) is
dn(fi) = dY n+ifi + (−1)nfidX i

1.

Given a dg-category A, we deﬁne a right dg A-module to be a dg-functor
M : Aop → k -dgModdg. A morphism of dg A-modules is a natural transfor-
mation of dg-functors. We let A -dgMod denote the category of dg A-modules.
Moreover, we can deﬁne the dg-category of dg A-modules, A -dgModdg in anal-
ogy to k -dgmoddg.

Each object X of A deﬁnes a dg A-module X ∧ : Y 7→ HomA(Y, X), and
∧ : X 7→ X ∧ deﬁnes a fully faithful dg-functor from A to A -dgModdg. We say
a dg-module M is representable if it is isomorphic to a dg-module in the image
of ∧. We can deﬁne the shift M[n] of a dg-module M by M[n](X) = M(X)[n].
Similarly, we deﬁne the cone of a morphism of dg-modules f : M → N to be the
dg-module given by C(f )(X) = C(fX ). The homology of a dg-module is also
deﬁned object-wise.

Note that when A has one object, ∗, we can identify A with the dg-algebra

A = EndA(∗); in this case a dg A-module is the same data as a dg A-module.

Localizing A -dgMod at the quasi-isomorphisms, we obtain the derived cate-
gory Ddg(A) of dg A-modules. Each dg-functor F : A → B deﬁnes an Aop ⊗ B-
module given by XF : (A, B) 7→ HomB(B, F A). Denote by rep(A, B) the set
of objects X ∈ Ddg(Aop ⊗ B) such that for all A ∈ A, X(A, −) is isomorphic
in Ddg(B) to a representable B-module. The correspondence F 7→ XF deﬁnes
a bijection between the morphisms A → B in Ho(dgcatk) and the isomorphism
classes of objects in rep(A, B). This correspondence respects composition, where
composition of bimodules is given by the derived tensor product.

A dg-category A is pretriangulated if for every X ∈ A and n ∈ Z, the dg-
module X ∧[n] is representable, and for any closed morphism f of degree zero,
C(f ∧) is representable. If A is pretriangulated, then H 0(A) is a triangulated cat-
egory, with shift and cone induced from A. Every dg-category A embeds into a
pretriangulated hull P reT r(A). The pretriangulated hull has an explicit con-
struction, due to Bondal and Kapranov [3], in terms of one-sided twisted com-
plexes. (Note that [3] uses the notation P reT r+(A) for this construction.) Every
morphism in Ho(dgcatk) from a dg-category A to a pretriangulated dg-category
B factors uniquely through P reT r(A), and if A is already pretriangulated then

10

it is quasi-equivalent to P reT r(A). Deﬁne the triangulated hull of A to be the
triangulated category T r(A) := H 0(P reT r(A)). H 0(A) ֒→ T r(A) generates
T r(A) as a triangulated category; if A is pretriangulated, then H 0(A) is equiva-
lent to T r(A).

Given a dg-category A and a full dg-subcategory B, there is a dg-category
A/B, called the dg-quotient of A by B. The dg-quotient is obtained by ”setting
all objects of B to zero” by formally adjoining a morphism EB for each object
B ∈ B satisfying d(EB) = idB. (See Drinfeld [6] for details.) The dg-quotient
generalizes the Verdier quotient in the sense that T r(A)/T r(B) ∼= T r(A/B). It is
characterized by the universal property that any morphism A → C in Ho(dgcatk)
sending each object of B to a contractible object in C factors uniquely through
A/B (Tabuada, [17]).

Given a dg-category A and F ∈ rep(A, A), one can deﬁne the dg-orbit cate-
gory P : A → A/F . This category is characterized by the universal property that
for any dg-category B and any G ∈ rep(A, B) such that G ◦ F ∼= G, G factors
through P . For a more precise description, see Keller [8], Section 9.3.

2.9 Left Dg-Modules

In this paper, we work exclusively with right dg-modules. All the results presented
are valid for left dg-modules, but minor adjustments must be made to account for
numerous unpleasant sign conventions. We describe the necessary adjustments
here.

If (A, dA) is a differential graded k-algebra, we deﬁne a left differential
graded A-module (or dg-module, for short) to be a pair (X, dX ) consisting of
a graded left A-module X and a degree 1 k-linear differential dX : X → X sat-
isfying dX(ax) = dA(a)x + (−1)|a|adX(x) for all homogeneous a ∈ A, x ∈ X.
We let A -dgmodl denote the category of left dg-modules over A.

If A is a graded algebra, we deﬁne the algebra (A, ◦) to be the set A with
multiplication given by a ◦ b = (−1)|a||b|(ab). Similarly, if M is a graded right A-
module, we denote by (M , ◦) the graded right A-module with M as the underlying

11

set and the operation given by m ◦ a = (−1)|m||a|ma. We deﬁne M similarly for
left graded modules. The functor sending M to M and acting as the identity on
morphisms deﬁnes an isomorphism between A -grmod and A -grmod.

Let Aop denote the opposite algebra. We call A

op

the graded opposite algebra.
If (M, dM ) ∈

If M is a left dg-module, deﬁne the dg-grading shift functor hni : (M, dM ) 7→
(Mhni, dM hni). The underlying set of the left graded module (Mhni, ·n) is M(n),
and the operation ·n is given by a ·n m = (−1)|a|nam. The differential is given
by dM hni = (−1)ndM . Triangles in the homotopy or derived categories take the
form X → Y → Z → Xh1i. For M • ∈ Comp(A -grmodl) we have that
\M •[n] =

Mhni and \M •(n) =

M (n).

If X and Y are graded modules, we say that a function f : X → Y is a
graded skew-morphism of degree n if it is a degree n k-linear map such that
f (ax) = (−1)n|a|af (x) for all x ∈ X and all homogeneous a ∈ A. We say two
morphisms of left dg-modules f, g : X → Y are homotopic if there is a graded
skew-morphism h : X → Y of degree −1 such that f − g = h ◦ dX + dY ◦ h.
We also note that if A has zero differential, then dA is a graded skew-morphism
of degree 1.

3 The Dg-Stable Category

3.1 Construction

Let A be a ﬁnite-dimensional, non-positively graded, self-injective k-algebra,
viewed as a dg-algebra with zero differential. In this section, we shall provide
a description of the dg-stable category of A in terms of the graded stable cate-
gory. In Deﬁnition 3.5, we deﬁne the orbit category C(A) = A -grstab /Ω(1). In
Deﬁnition 3.8 we deﬁne a functor FA : C(A) → A -dgstab and in Theorem 3.10

12

we show that FA is fully faithful with essential image generating A -dgstab as a
triangulated category.

We begin with some simple facts about graded A-modules.

Proposition 3.1. Let X, Y ∈ A -grmod. If supp(X) ∩ supp(Y ) = ∅, then both
HomA -grmod(X, Y ) and HomA -grstab(X, Y ) are zero.

Proof. The ﬁrst part of the statement follows immediately from the deﬁnition of
morphisms of graded modules. Since HomA -grstab(X, Y ) is deﬁned as a quotient
of HomA -grmod(X, Y ), the second part of the statement follows from the ﬁrst.

Proposition 3.2. Let X ∈ A -grmod. Then

max(hd(X)) = max(X)
min(soc(X)) = min(X)

Proof. The radical of A is a graded submodule of A (see Kelarev, [7]), and so
rad(X) = Xrad(A) is a graded submodule of X. Thus hd(X) = X/rad(X) is
graded with supp(hd(X)) ⊂ supp(X). Therefore max(hd(X)) ≤ max(X).

To establish the reverse inequality, take a nonzero element x ∈ X max(X).
If x /∈ rad(X), then the image of x in hd(X) is a nonzero element in de-
gree max(X), and we are done. Suppose x ∈ rad(X). Note that since X is
ﬁnitely generated and A is ﬁnite-dimensional, X is also ﬁnite dimensional. Thus
radk(X) becomes zero for sufﬁciently large k. Since x is nonzero, there is a
m
maximum n > 0 such that x ∈ radn(X) = Xradn(A). Write x =
i=1 xiai
for some homogeneous ai ∈ radn(A), xi ∈ X. Without loss of generality, we
may assume that all terms are nonzero and that deg(xiai) = deg(x) for all i.
Since deg(x) = max(X) and A is non-positively graded, we must have that
deg(xi) = max(X) and deg(ai) = 0 for all i. Since each ai ∈ radn(A) and
x /∈ radn+1(X), there must be some j such that xj /∈ rad(X). Thus we have
obtained a nonzero xj ∈ X max(X) − rad(X), and so max(hd(X)) = max(X).

P

For the second equation, note that soc(X) is a graded submodule of X (see
Nˇastˇasescu and Van Oystaeyen, [12]). Thus supp(soc(X)) ⊂ supp(X) and so
min(soc(X)) ≥ min(X).

For the reverse inequality, it sufﬁces to show that soc(X)∩X min(X) 6= 0. Since
A is non-positively graded, X min(X)A ⊂ X min(X) and so X min(X) is a submodule
of X. Since X is ﬁnite-dimensional, X min(X) has a simple submodule and thus
has nonzero intersection with soc(X). Therefore min(soc(X)) = min(X).

13

Proposition 3.3. Let X ∈ Ob(A-grmod). Then
1) max(ΩX) ≤ max(X)
2) min(Ω′X) ≥ min(X)
3) max(P −n
4) min(I n
(See Section 2.6 for notation.)

X (n)) = max(ΩnX(n)) ≤ max(X) − n
X (−n)) = min((Ω′)nX(−n)) ≥ min(X) + n

Proof. Since I ⊂ Aop ⊗k A, we have that max(I) ≤ max(Aop ⊗k A) = 0. Thus
max(ΩX) = max(X ⊗A I) ≤ max(I) + max(X) ≤ max(X).

Similarly, min(Ω′X) = min(Hom•
A(I, X)) ≥ min(X)−max(I) ≥ min(X).
The last two equations follow from the ﬁrst two and the deﬁnitions of the

standard projective and injective resolutions.

Recall from Section 2.6 that the functor Ω(1) is an autoequivalence of A -grstab
and A -dgstab. By replacing A -grstab and A -dgstab with equivalent categories
^A -grstab and ^A -dgstab (see Section 2.8), we may assume without loss of gen-
erality that Ω(1) is an automorphism of both categories. We let Ω−1 denote the
inverse of Ω, and we shall identify it with the isomorphic functor Ω′.

Going forward, we shall write Ω−n to mean (Ω′)n for n ≥ 0, even on A -grmod
and A -dgmod. This is a dangerous abuse of notation as Ω is not invertible in
either category. However, adopting this convention allows us to greatly simplify
certain expressions and is safe as long as we avoid expressions of the form ΩΩ−1X
outside the stable category.

We obtain the following corollary of Proposition 3.3.

Proposition 3.4. Let X, Y ∈ Ob(A-grmod). Then HomA-grstab(X, ΩnY (n)) = 0
for all but ﬁnitely many n ∈ Z.

Proof. By Proposition 3.3, max(ΩY (1)) ≤ max(Y (1)) = max(Y ) − 1 and so
max(ΩnY (n)) ≤ max(Y ) − n. Thus for n >> 0, we have that max(ΩnY (n)) <
min(X). Similarly, min(Ω−nY (−n)) ≥ min(Y ) + n, and so for n >> 0 we
have that min(Ω−nY (−n)) > max(X). Thus HomA-grmod(X, ΩnY (n)) = 0 for
all but ﬁnitely many n.

We are now ready to state the main deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 3.5. Let C(A) be the category given by:
1) Ob(C(A)) = Ob(A -grstab)
2) For X, Y ∈ Ob(C(A)), HomC(A)(X, Y ) =
3) For (fn)n∈Z : X → Y and (gm)m∈Z : Y → Z, deﬁne composition by
(gm) ◦ (fn) = (

i∈Z Ωigj−i(i) ◦ fi)j∈Z.

L

n∈Z HomA -grstab(X, ΩnY (n))

14

Remark. If we do not wish to assume that Ω(1) is an automorphism of A -grstab,
natural isomorphisms εn,m : ΩnΩm → Ωn+m satisfying the appropriate coherence
conditions must be inserted into the composition formula.

We note that the sum in the composition formula is ﬁnite by Proposition 3.4.
It is clear that C(A) is an additive category. In fact, C(A) is precisely the orbit
category A -grstab /Ω(1) as deﬁned by Keller, [8]. Keller shows that while such
a category need not be triangulated, it can always be included in a ”triangulated
hull”. We shall see that A -dgstab is the triangulated hull of C(A).

Proposition 3.6. The orbit category C(A) is a Krull-Schmidt category.

Proof. Since A -grstab is Krull-Schmidt and the natural map A -grstab → C(A)
is additive and essentially surjective, any object of C(A) can be written as a direct
sum of indecomposable objects in A -grstab. Thus, it sufﬁces to show that any
indecomposable object X of A -grstab has local endomorphism ring in C(A).

First, we claim that for any indecomposable X in A -grmod and any i 6= 0,
any map f : X → ΩiX(i) → X lies in rad(EndA -grmod(X)). By Proposition
3.3, supp(X) * supp(ΩiX(i)), hence f cannot be surjective and thus is not an
isomorphism. Since EndA -grmod(X) is a local ﬁnite-dimensional algebra, f lies in
the unique maximal two-sided ideal, which is equal to the Jacobson radical. Since
EndA -grstab(X) is a quotient of EndA -grmod(X), we also have that the image of f
lies in rad(EndA -grstab(X)).

Let X ∈ A -grstab be indecomposable. We must show that EndC(A)(X) is
local. Write Vn = HomA -grstab(X, Ωn(X)(n)) for the n-th graded component of
EndC(A)(X). We claim that the subspace V := rad(V0) ⊕
n6=0 Vn is the unique
maximal two-sided ideal of EndC(A)(X).

To show V is a two-sided ideal, take fi in the ith graded piece of V and gj ∈
Vj. If i + j 6= 0, then gjfi ∈ V . If i = −j 6= 0, then gjfi : X → ΩiX(i) → X
is an element of rad(V0). Finally, if i = j = 0, then we immediately have that
g0f0 ∈ rad(V0). Thus V is a left ideal, and a parallel argument shows it is a right
ideal.

Clearly, EndC(A)(X)/V ∼= EndA -grstab(X)/rad(EndA -grstab(X)), which is a

L

division ring since X is indecomposable. Thus V is maximal.

To show V is the unique maximal ideal, it sufﬁces to show that it is equal to
rad(EndC(A)(X)). As a maximal two-sided ideal, V contains the radical. For the
reverse inclusion, it sufﬁces to show that every element f = (fi) ∈ V is nilpotent,
since the Jacobson radical contains every nil ideal.

Let N be such that Vi = 0 for all |i| > N. Then note that the i-th graded piece
of f n is a sum of maps of the form X h1−→ Ωi1X(i1) h2−→ Ωi2X(i2) · · · hn−→ ΩiX(i),

15

where the hj are translations of the fk by various powers of Ω(1). If |ij| > N
for any j, the composite map is zero, so we may assume that |ij| ≤ N for all
1 ≤ j ≤ n. If n > m(2N + 1) for some m ≥ 1, then by the pigeonhole principle
there exists −N ≤ r ≤ N such that ΩrX(r) appears as the codomain of one of
the hj at least m + 1 times. Grouping terms, we can then express the composition
φm+1−−−→ ΩiX(i), where the φk
as X
are compositions of successive hj.

φm−−→ ΩrX(r)

φ0−→ ΩrX(r)

φ1−→ ΩrX(r)

φ2−→ · · ·

I claim that for all 1 ≤ k ≤ m, φk lies in rad(EndA -grstab(ΩrX(r))). Note
that since f0 lies in the radical of EndA -grstab(X) and Ω(1) is an autoequivalence,
we have that Ωr(f )(r) lies in the radical of the local ring EndA -grstab(ΩrX(r)).
Thus, if one of the factors of φk is Ωr(f0)(r), then we are done. If not, then we
must have that φk factors through ΩjX(j) for some j 6= r, which again guarantees
that φk lies in the radical.

We have shown that for n > m(2N + 1), each component of f n is a sum
m+1
i=0 φi, with φi ∈ rad(EndA -grstab(ΩrX(r))) for each
of terms of the form
1 ≤ i ≤ m and some −N ≤ r ≤ N. But rad(EndA -grstab(ΩrX(r))) is nilpotent
for each r, hence f is nilpotent.

Q

We now deﬁne the inclusion functor FA : C(A) → A-dgstab. The obvious
choice would be for FA to act as the identity on objects and send the morphism
(fn)n : X → Y to the sum of its components
n∈Z ψn,Y ◦ fn, where the ψn,Y :
ΩnY (n) → Y are isomorphisms chosen so that all the summands share a common
domain. However, in order for this process to be functorial, the morphisms ψn,Y
must be satisfy appropriate compatibility conditions.

P

Lemma 3.7. There exists a family of natural isomorphisms {ψn : Ωn(n) →
idA -dgstab | n ∈ Z} satisfying:
i) ψ0 = idA -dgstab
ii) For all n, m ∈ Z, ψm ◦ (ψn ◦ Ωm(m)) = ψn+m

Proof. Let ψ1 : Ω(1) → idA -dgstab be the natural isomorphism deﬁned in Section
2.6. Let ψ−1 = (ψ1 ◦ Ω−1(−1))−1 : Ω−1(−1) → idA -dgstab. Let ψ0 = idA -dgstab.
For n ≥ 2, recursively deﬁne ψn = ψ1 ◦ (ψn−1 ◦ Ω(1)) and analogously for
n ≤ −2. It is clear that {ψn} satisﬁes i) and ii).

Remark. If we do not assume that Ω(1) is an autormorphism of A -dgstab, we
must again insert appropriately chosen natural isomorphisms εn,m : ΩnΩm →
Ωn+m into condition ii).

16

Deﬁnition 3.8. Let ψn : Ωn(n) → idA -dgstab be the natural isomorphisms deﬁned
in Lemma 3.7. Let FA : C(A) → A-dgstab be the functor given by:
1) FA acts as the identity on objects.
2) Given f = (fn)n∈Z ∈ HomC(A)(X, Y ), let FA(f ) =

n∈Z ψn,Y ◦ fn.

Proposition 3.9. FA as deﬁned above is a functor.

P

Proof. Take X ∈ C(A). The identity morphism on X is (δ0,nidX)n. Therefore
n∈Z ψn,X ◦ δ0,nidX = ψ0,X = idX. Thus FA preserves
FA((δ0,nidX)n) =
identity morphisms.

Given (fn)n : X → Y, (gm)m : Y → Z in C(A), we have

3.2 Embedding C(A) into A -dgstab

We now state the main theorem.

Theorem 3.10. FA : C(A) → A-dgstab is fully faithful, and the image of FA
generates A-dgstab as a triangulated category.

We prove the theorem with a sequence of lemmas below.

Deﬁnition 3.11. Let X, Y ∈ A -grmod, viewed as dg-modules with zero differen-
tial. If X and Y are nonzero, let N = NX,Y := max{n ≤ 0 | max(Ω−nY (−n)) <
min(X)}. Deﬁne the bridge complex from X to Y to be the complex R•
X,Y =
B≥N
(see Sections 2.2 and 2.6 for notation) if X and Y are both nonzero, and
Y
R•
X,Y = 0 otherwise.

17

By Proposition 3.3, NX,Y is well-deﬁned. We will omit the subscript when it

is clear from context.

By unwinding the deﬁnitions, we obtain a quasi-isomorphism of complexes
X,Y ) = 0

X,Y ) ∼= Ω−N (Y ) and H k(R•

X,Y . In particular, H N (R•

Ω−N (Y )[−N] ֒→ R•
for k 6= N. We also note that ker(dn

RX,Y )(−n) = Ω−nX(−n) for all n ≥ N.

Morphisms in A -dgstab can be represented as equivalence classes of roofs
f
−→ M s←− Y , where s has perfect cone. The primary challenge in understanding
X
morphisms in A -dgstab is that perfect dg-modules need not arise from complexes
of graded projective modules. However, by restricting our attention to dg-modules
with zero differential, we can bypass this difﬁculty by using the bridge complexes
deﬁned above.

Lemma 3.12. Let X, Y ∈ A -grmod. Then any morphism in HomA -dgstab(X, Y )
can be expressed as a roof of the form

X

Y

f

i

\τ≤0RX,Y

where i is induced by the natural map Y → R•

In order for ξ to be well-deﬁned, we
must show that φ−1 ◦ f ∈ Mor(Ddg(A)) can be represented by a roof in Db
dg(A).
By Proposition 3.3, the sequence {min( \τ>M RX,Y )}M strictly increases with M.
Since X is ﬁnitely generated, there exists M >> 0 such that the image of f lies in
\τ≤M (RX,Y ). It is clear that the inclusion φ also factors through \τ≤M (RX,Y ), and
the inclusion of \τ≤M (RX,Y ) into [RX,Y is a quasi-isomorphism. Thus RX,Y can be
replaced by the bounded dg-module \τ≤M (RX,Y ) in the roof φ−1 ◦ f , and so we
may view φ−1 ◦ f as a morphism in Mor(Db

dg(A)). Thus ξ is well-deﬁned.

We now prove surjectivity of ξ. Since RX,Y ∈ Ho+(A -grproj), we have
that HomHodg(A)(X, [RX,Y ) ∼= HomDdg(A)(X, [RX,Y ). Post-composition with φ−1

sufﬁces to show that Φ(fn) is nullhomotopic if and only if fn factors through a
projective module for all n. We also note that d bP is A-linear, since dA = 0.
Suppose that Φ(fn) is nullhomotopic and ﬁx k ∈ Z. Let h : X →

a homotopy. Since dX = 0, we have that Φ(fn) = d bP (−1) ◦ h (as morphisms of

graded modules). As a graded module,
P =

Since Qn is projective, bn lifts to cn : Qn → P n−1(−n). Deﬁne hn = cn ◦ an, as

ses of Lemmas 3.14 and 3.15 are satisﬁed by X and RX,Y . By Proposition 3.3 we

23

have that HomA -grmod(X, ker(dn
RX,Y )(−n)) = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many n. By
construction, RX,Y ∈ Comp(A -grproj) is exact at all n 6= N. By the deﬁnition
of N, HomA-dgmod(X, Ω−N Y (−N)) = 0. Thus the hypotheses of Lemmas 3.14
and 3.15 are satisﬁed.

with Φ of Lemma 3.15. Thus χ is an isomorphism.

We are now ready to prove Theorem 3.10.

Lemma 3.17. The functor FA is fully faithful.

Proof. Let X, Y ∈ A -grmod. From Lemmas 3.13 and 3.16, we obtain an iso-
morphism ξ ◦ χ : HomC(A)(X, Y ) ∼−→ HomA -dgstab(X, Y ). It remains to show that
this isomorphism is induced by FA.

We have that ξ ◦ χ(fn) =

n i−1 ◦ φ−1 ◦ in ◦ f−n. Since f−n = 0 for n ≤ N,
it sufﬁces to show that i−1 ◦ φ−1 ◦ in = ψ−n,Y for n > N, where the ψ−n,Y are
deﬁned in Lemma 3.7.

It follows easily from the deﬁnitions that ψ−n,Y can be represented by roofs of

the form

(This is immediate for all maps except in.

Every map in the above diagrams is either a quasi-isomorphism or has perfect
cone.
It then follows that in is an
isomorphism in A -dgstab, hence has perfect cone.) Thus the above diagrams
show that the roof deﬁning ψn,Y is equivalent to i−1 ◦ φ−1 ◦ in for all n > N.

Lemma 3.18. The image of FA generates A -dgstab as a triangulated category.

Proof. Let T denote the full, replete, triangulated subcategory of A -dgstab gen-
erated by the image of FA. Let M ∈ A -dgstab. Since ker(dM ) is a zero-
differential dg-submodule of M, it lies in T . Thus if ker(dM ) = M, we are
done. Likewise, if ker(dM ) = 0, then M is acyclic and thus isomorphic to
zero in A -dgstab. Thus we may assume that ker(dM ) is a proper nontrivial dg-
submodule of M.

25

The short exact sequence 0 → ker(dM ) ֒→ M ։ M/ker(dM ) → 0 induces
an exact triangle in A -dgstab. M is ﬁnitely generated, hence ﬁnite-dimensional,
thus dim(M/ker(dM )) < dim(M). By induction on dim(M), we may assume
that M/ker(dM )) ∈ T . Since ker(dM ), M/ker(dM ) ∈ T it follows that M ∈ T .
Thus T = A -dgstab.

3.3 The Dg-stable Category as a Triangulated Hull

Theorem 3.10 suggests that A -dgstab the triangulated hull of C(A). To establish
this, we must express our constructions in the language of dg-categories.

Given a category C with an automorphism Φ, we can deﬁne a category Cgr, en-
riched in k -grmod, with the same objects as C and morphisms Homn
Cgr (X, Y ) :=
HomC(X, Φn(Y )). The grading shift functor (1) is an automorphism of the cat-
egories A -grmod, A -grstab, and C(A), allowing us to deﬁne the corresponding
graded categories, which we view as dg-categories. The natural functors between
these categories are all compatible with grading shifts and hence lift to functors
of dg-categories. Likewise, the functor Ω commutes with grading shifts and thus
deﬁnes a dg-endofunctor of each of these categories.

We can view the differential graded algebra A as a dg-category with one
object, and we denote the associated dg-category of (bounded) dg-modules by
A -dgmoddg. We have that Z 0(A -dgmoddg) ∼= A -dgmod and H 0(A -dgmoddg) ∼=
Hob

dg(A). There is a natural dg-functor A -grmodgr → A -dgstabdg.
Deﬁne the dg-derived category Db

dg(A) to be the dg-quotient of A -dgmoddg by
the full dg-subcategory of acyclic dg-modules. Similarly, let A -dgstabdg denote
the dg-quotient of A -dgmoddg by the full dg-subcategory of objects which are
quasi-isomorphic to a perfect dg-module. We have that H 0(Db
dg(A),
H 0(A -dgstabdg) ∼= A -dgstab, and there are natural dg-functors A -dgmoddg →
Db

dg(A)) ∼= Db

dg(A) → A -dgstabdg.

Since the functor Ω is given by tensoring with the bimodule I deﬁned in Sec-
tion 2.6, it induces a dg-functor A -dgmoddg → A -dgmoddg. Since this functor
preserves acyclic and perfect dg-modules, by the universal property of the dg-
quotient, it descends to a dg-endofunctor of Db

dg(A) and A -dgstabdg.

Since the natural dg-functor A -grmodgr → A -dgstabdg sends projective
modules to zero, we obtain an induced dg-functor A -grstabgr → A -dgstabdg
which is the identity on objects. We would like this functor to descend to C(A)gr.

Proposition 3.19. C(A)gr is the dg-orbit category of A -grstabgr by the functor
Ω(1).

26

Proof. By construction, the projection map A -grstab → C(A) is essentially sur-
jective, and the natural map

colimr>>0 HomA -grstabgr (ΩrX(r), Ωr+cY (r + c)) → HomC(A)gr (X, Y )

Mc∈Z

is an isomorphism of dg k-modules. The result then follows by Keller’s charac-
terization of the orbit category ( [8], Section 9.3, part d) of the Theorem).

Write B = A -grstabgr and C = A -dgstabdg. Let Fdg : B → C denote the
natural dg-functor. Since Fdg is the identity on objects, we can identify it with
the dg Bop ⊗ C-module (X, Y ) 7→ HomC(Y, X ⊗A A). Similarly, we can identify
Fdg ◦ Ω(1) with the dg bimodule given by (X, Y ) 7→ HomC(Y, X ⊗A I(1)). By
dg(Aop ⊗k A)
construction of I, we have a closed morphism φ : A → I(1) in Db
dg(Aop ⊗k A). Thus, φ descends to a closed morphism
which has perfect cone in Db
in C which becomes an isomorphism in H 0(C) = A -dgstab. Thus φ induces a
quasi-isomorphism of dg-bimodules from Fdg to Fdg ◦Ω(1). Thus, by the universal
property of the orbit category, Fdg descends to C(A)dg, and it is clear that H 0(Fdg)
is the functor FA deﬁned in 3.8.

Corollary 3.20. A -dgstab is equivalent to the triangulated hull T r(C(A)gr).

Proof. By the universal property of the pretriangulated hull, the dg-functor Fdg :
C(A)gr → A -dgstabdg ֒→ P reT r(A -dgstabdg) factors through a dg-functor
F :
P reT r(C(A)gr) → P reT r(A -dgstabdg). By construction, H 0(A -dgstabdg) ∼=
A -dgstab generates H 0(P reT r(A -dgstabdg)) = T r(A -dgstabdg) as a triangu-
b
lated category. Since A -dgstab is already triangulated, we have that A -dgstab ∼=
T r(A -dgstabdg).

The functor H 0(

F ) : T r(C(A)gr) → A -dgstab is exact and restricts to FA on
the image of C(A) inside T r(C(A)gr). The image of FA generates A -dgstab as
F ) is triangulated, hence H 0(
a triangulated category, and the image of H 0(
b
F ) is
essentially surjective. Furthermore, H 0(
F ) is fully faithful on C(A). Since C(A)
generates T r(C(A)) as a triangulated category, it follows by a standard argument
that H 0(
b
F ) is fully faithful. Thus A -dgstab is equivalent to T r(C(A)gr).

Having proven Corollary 3.20, we make a few brief remarks on when two
graded algebras A and B have equivalent dg-stable categories. If Db(A -grmod)
is equivalent to Db(B -grmod), then the equivalence can be expressed as tensoring
(See Rickard, [14]). This functor is still deﬁned on the
by a tilting complex.

27

derived category of dg-modules and remains an equivalence. Furthermore, this
equivalence preserves the perfect dg-modules and thus induces an equivalence
between the dgstable categories. Thus, graded derived equivalence implies dg-
stable equivalence. However, we can say more:

Lemma 3.21. Let A and B be ﬁnite-dimensional self-injective algebras, graded
in non-positive degree. Suppose there is an equivalence of triangulated categories
G : A -grstab → B -grstab which commutes with grading shifts. Then G induces
an equivalence between A -dgstab and B -dgstab.

Proof. Since G is a triangulated equivalence, it commutes with Ω. Thus G com-
mutes with the functor Ω(1) and induces a functor C(A) → C(B). Given Y ∈
B -grstab, there exists X ∈ A -grstab such that G(X) ∼= Y in B -grstab, hence
in C(B). Thus the induced functor on the orbit category is essentially surjective.
Given X, Y ∈ A -grstab, the map HomC(A)(X, Y ) → HomC(B)(G(X), G(Y )) is
bijective, since HomA -grstab(X, Ωn(Y )(n)) → HomB -grstab(G(X), ΩnG(Y )(n))
is bijective for each n ∈ Z. Thus G : C(A) → C(B) is an equivalence. Similarly,
G induces an equivalence of dg-categories C(A)gr → C(B)gr.

The composition C(A)gr → C(B)gr → P reT r(C(B)gr) factors through the
pretriangulated hull P reT r(C(A)gr). Applying H 0, we obtain an exact functor
G : A -dgstab → B -dgstab extending G. Since G is an equivalence, it follows
that G is an equivalence.

4 Essential Surjectivity

4.1 Morphisms Concentrated in One Degree

Let A be a non-positively graded ﬁnite-dimensional self-injective algebra over a
ﬁeld k. Let FA : C(A) → A -dgstab be the functor of Deﬁnition 3.8. Having
shown in the previous section that FA is fully faithful, we now investigate condi-
tions on A that guarantee essential surjectivity.

Since the image of C(A) generates A -dgstab as a triangulated category, FA
is essentially surjective if and only if the essential image Im(FA) is a triangu-
lated subcategory of A -dgstab, if and only if C(A) admits a triangulated structure
compatible with FA. In general, this is not the case.

The primary obstacle to essential surjectivity is that there is no natural candi-
date for the cone of a morphism (fn)n : X → Y for which more than one fn is
nonzero. The cone of such a morphism will correspond to a dg-module that does

28

not arise from a chain complex and need not be isomorphic to a chain complex
modulo projectives.

However, by imposing restrictions on the algebra A, we can prevent this sce-
nario from occurring. In this case, we shall see that FA is essentially surjective,
hence an equivalence.

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let X, Y ∈ Im(FA) ⊂ A -dgstab. We say that a morphism
f : X → Y is chain-like if C(f ) ∈ Im(FA). We say that X ∈ Im(FA) is nice if
f : X → Y is chain-like for all Y ∈ Im(FA) and all f ∈ HomA -dgstab(X, Y ).

Note that Im(FA) is closed under cones (and thus triangulated) if and only if
all of its objects are nice. In fact, it sufﬁces for all the indecomposable objects of
Im(FA) to be nice:

Lemma 4.2. Let X1, X2 ∈ Im(FA) be nice. Then X1 ⊕ X2 is nice.

Proof. Take Y ∈ Im(FA) and (f1 f2) : X1 ⊕ X2 → Y . Applying the octahedron
axiom to the composition f1 = (f1 f2) ◦ i1, we obtain the following diagram:

f1

X1

(1)

i1

X2

X1 ⊕ X2

(f1 f2)

Y

(1)

h

C(f1 f2)

(1)

g

C(f1)

The bottom-most triangle is exact, so C(f1 f2) is the cone of g : X2 → C(f1).
Since X1 is nice and Y ∈ Im(FA), it follows that C(f1) ∈ Im(FA). Since X2 is
nice, C(f1 f2) ∈ Im(FA). Thus X1 ⊕ X2 is nice.

The following condition is sufﬁcient to guarantee that all indecomposables are

nice.

Lemma 4.3 (One Morphism Rule). Suppose for all indecomposable X, Y ∈
A -grmod, HomA -grstab(X, ΩnY (n)) 6= 0 for at most one n ∈ Z. Then every
indecomposable object of Im(FA) is nice. In particular, FA : C(A) → A -dgstab
is an equivalence.

29

n
Proof. Let X ∈ A -grmod be indecomposable. Let M =
i=1 Yi ∈ Im(FA),
with Yi indecomposable. Changing each Yi up to isomorphism, we may assume
without loss of generality that HomA -grstab(X, ΩnYi(n)) = 0 for n 6= 0. Then
any morphism (fn)n : X → M in C(A) is concentrated in degree 0 and thus
can be identiﬁed with the morphism f0 in A -grstab. Since FA is fully faithful,
any morphism f : X → M in A -dgstab can be represented by a morphism in
A -grmod.

L

Choosing a monomorphism i : X ֒→ I, where I is injective, we obtain a

short exact sequence of graded A-modules 0 → X
which induces an exact triangle in Db

(f i)
−−→ M ⊕ I → C → 0
dg(A), hence in A -dgstab. Since I ∼= 0 in
f
A -dgstab, this triangle is equivalent to one of the form X
−→ M → C → X(1).
C is a cone of f and lies in the image of FA (since it is in A -grmod). Thus X is
nice.

The second statement follows immediately from Lemma 4.2 and the preceding

remarks.

Remark. The hypotheses of Lemma 4.3 are quite restrictive. However, we note
that if A is concentrated in degree 0 (that is, ungraded), then the One Morphism
Rule is trivially satisﬁed.

In this case, any indecomposable object X ∈ A -grmod is concentrated in a
single degree n, and so ΩnX(n) is concentrated in degree 0. Thus every object of
C(A) is isomorphic to an object concentrated in degree zero, and HomC(A)(X, Y )
∼= HomA -stab(X, Y ) for any two such objects X and Y . Thus C(A) is equivalent
to A -stab.

dg(A)/Dperf

Furthermore, a dg-module over A is the same as a complex of A-modules.
Thus A -dgstab = Db
(A) = Db(A -mod)/Dperf (A -mod). Thus, in
the case where A an ungraded ﬁnite-dimensional, self-injective algebra, Theo-
rem 3.10 and Lemma 4.3 precisely yield Rickard’s Theorem [13] that A -stab ∼=
Db(A -mod)/Dperf (A -mod). Thus it is appropriate to view C(A) as the differen-
tial graded analogue of the additive deﬁnition of the stable module category.

dg

4.2 Nakayama Algebras

Deﬁnition 4.4. A Nakayama algebra is a ﬁnite-dimensional algebra for which
all indecomposable projective and injective modules are uniserial.

Since every indecomposable module has an indecomposable projective cover,

30

it follows that every indecomposable module over a Nakayama algebra is unise-
rial.

Proposition 4.5. Let A be a ﬁnite-dimensional, self-injective Nakayama algebra,
graded in non-positive degree. Let X ∈ A -grmod be indecomposable and not
projective. Let pX : PX ։ X be a projective cover of X and let iX : X ֒→ IX be
an injective hull of X. Let K = ker(pX) and C = coker(iX). Then max(K) ≤
min(X), and max(X) ≤ min(C).

Proof. For any k ≥ 0 and Y ∈ A -grmod, let Lk(Y ) = radk(Y )/radk+1(Y ) be
the k-th radical layer of Y . Let l(Y ) denote the length of Y . If Y is indecompos-
able, then it is uniserial and so Lk(Y ) is simple for 0 ≤ k < l(Y ).

Since X is indecomposable, PX is indecomposable, hence uniserial, and we
have that K = ker(pX) = radl(X)(PX) and X ∼= PX /radl(X)(PX). Let M =
radl(X)−1(PX)/radl(X)+1(PX ). Then hd(M) = Ll(X)−1(PX) = soc(X) and
soc(M) = Ll(X)(PX) = hd(K) are simple. Thus,

max(K) = max(hd(K)) = max(soc(M)) = min(soc(M)) = min(M)
≤ max(M) = max(hd(M)) = max(soc(X)) = min(soc(X))
= min(X)

The proof of the second inequality is precisely dual, using the socle layers of

IX.

Lemma 4.6. Let A be a non-positively graded, ﬁnite-dimensional, self-injective
Nakayama algebra. Then the conditions of Lemma 4.3 are satisﬁed. In particular,
FA is an equivalence.

Proof. Let X, Y ∈ A -grmod be indecomposable, and suppose that there is a
nonzero morphism f : X → Ωm(Y )(m) in A -grstab for some m ∈ Z. Changing
Y up to isomorphism in Im(FA) ⊂ A -dgstab, we may assume that m = 0. Then
there is a nonzero morphism from X to Y in A -grmod, and so max(hd(X)) ≥
min(soc(Y )).

Note that Ω(Y ) ∈ A -grmod has a unique (up to isomorphism) non-projective
direct summand K, which is the kernel of a projective cover of Y . Then Ω(Y ) ∼=
K in A -grstab, hence in Im(FA).
Identifying Ω(Y ) with K, Proposition 4.5
states that max(Ω(Y )(1)) < min(soc(Y )) ≤ max(hd(X)) = min(hd(X)).
Thus HomA -grstab(X, ΩY (1)) = 0 and, by induction, HomA -grstab(X, ΩnY (n)) =
0 for all n > 0. A dual argument shows that max(hd(X)) < min(Ω−1Y (−1))
and so HomA -grstab(X, ΩnY (n)) = 0 for all n < 0.

4.3 An Example of the Failure of Essential Surjectivity

Let A = k[x, y]/(x2, y2), where k = C. We grade A by putting x in degree 0 and
y in degree −1. It is easy to check that A is symmetric, hence self-injective. Up to
grading shift, A has a single simple graded module, S, which has dimension one
and upon which both x and y act by zero. Therefore, up to grading shift, the only
indecomposable projective module is A itself.

The representation theory of A is closely related to that of the Kronecker

quiver,

v1

a

b

v2

We let B denote the path algebra of this quiver, with a in degree 0 and b in de-
gree −1. B has two simple modules S1 and S2, one corresponding to each ver-
tex. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the indecomposable graded
A-modules, excluding the projective module, and the graded B-modules, exclud-
ing the simple module S2. (See Chapter 4.3 of [1] for the ungraded case. Note
that the graded case follows from the same argument.)

The classiﬁcation of graded indecomposable B-modules is known. (For in-
stance, see Seidel [16], Section 4.) Transferring these results to A-modules, we
obtain the following classiﬁcation of the indecomposable graded A-modules. Up
to shift, these are:
1) The indecomposable projective module, A.
2) For n ≥ 0, the module K n, which is of dimension 2n + 1. As a graded vector

space, K n = V ⊕ W , where V =
i=1 k(i), and x and y act

respectively. Note that in A -grstab we have that K n ∼= ΩnS for all n ≥ 0. We

∼= M0,n(1) and M∞,n

In C(A), functors Ω and (−1) are isomorphic, so our list of indecomposable
objects shrinks. In A -grstab, note that ΩM0,n = M0,n and ΩM∞,n = M∞,n(1);
∼= M∞,n(2) in C(A). Thus, a complete list of
thus M0,n
indecomposable objects in C(A) up to isomorphism is:
1) S(n), for n ∈ Z.
2) M0,m, for m > 0.
3) M∞,m(n), for m > 0 and n ∈ {0, 1}.

The sizes of the following Hom sets in A -dgstab are an immediate conse-
quence of the above computations for A -grstab and some simple counting argu-
ments.

We are now ready to construct an object K of A -dgstab lying outside of C(A).
From the above computations, we have that dim HomA -dgstab(S, S(2)) = 2; for
a basis we can take the unique (up to a nonzero scalar) morphisms f−1 : S →
Ω−1(S)(1) ∼= S(2) and f−2 : S → Ω−2S ∼= S(2). Let g = f−1 + f−2, and let K

34

be the cone of g in A -dgstab. We shall show that K does not lie in the image of
FA.

Proposition 4.7. dim HomA -dgstab(K, S(n)) = 1 for all n ≥ 3

g
Proof. Consider the triangle S
−→ S(2) → K → S(1) which deﬁnes K. Choos-
ing some n ≥ 2, we apply HomA -dgstab(−, S(n)) and observe the resulting long
exact sequence. We will show that g(−k)∗ : HomA -dgstab(S(2 − k), S(n)) →
HomA -dgstab(S(−k), S(n)) is injective for all k ≥ 0. From this, it will follow
from the long exact sequence that

dim HomA -dgstab(K(−k − 1), S(n)) = dim HomA -dgstab(S(−k), S(n))

− dim HomA -dgstab(S(2 − k), S(n))
= 1

for all k ≥ 0, and we will have dim HomA -dgstab(K, S(n)) = 1 for all n ≥ 3.

Applying the functor (k), it sufﬁces to show that g∗ : HomA -dgstab(S(2), S(r))
→ HomA -dgstab(S, S(r)) is injective for all r ≥ 2, where r = n + k. Interpreting
f−1 and f−2 as morphisms in A -dgstab, we have that g∗ = f ∗
−2. If we are
given a nonzero morphism hs : S(2) → ΩsS(r+s) in A -grstab, a straightforward
computation shows that both Ω−1hs(−1) ◦ f−1 : S → Ωs−1S(r + s − 1) and
Ω−2hs(−2) ◦ f−2 : S → Ωs−2S(r + s − 2) are nonzero morphisms in A -grstab.
It follows immediately that f ∗

−1 + f ∗

−2 are injective.

−1 and f ∗

We now show that g∗ is injective. Let (hs)s : S(2) → S(r) in C(A). Note that
2 ⌉+ 1. Therefore g∗(hs)s = (as)s,

hs can be nonzero only when −r + 2 ≤ s ≤ −⌈ r
where

Ω−2h−r+2(−2) ◦ f−2
Ω−1hs+1(−1) ◦ f−1 + Ω−2hs+2(−2) ◦ f−2
Ω−1h−⌈ r
0

2 ⌉+1(−1) ◦ f−1

if s = −r
if − r < s < −⌈ r
2 ⌉
if s = −⌈ r
2 ⌉
otherwise

Now suppose that g∗(hs) = 0. If (hs)s 6= 0, let N be the maximum s such
2 ⌉ + 1, and by

−1, we have that N < −⌈ r

that hs is nonzero. By injectivity of f ∗
injectivity of f ∗

−2, we have that N > −r + 2. But then

as = 



0 = aN −1 = Ω−1hN (−1) ◦ f−1 + Ω−2hN +1(−2) ◦ f−2

= Ω−1hN (−1) ◦ f−1 + 0

35

Injectivity of f ∗

−1 implies that Ω−1hN (−1) = 0, hence hN = 0. As this
contradicts the deﬁnition of N, we must have that hs = 0 for all s, and so g∗ is
injective for all r ≥ 2. Thus dim HomA -dgstab(K, S(n)) = 1 for all n ≥ 3.

Proposition 4.7 and the above computations of Hom spaces show that K
cannot be isomorphic to any object of C(A) except possibly M∞,2, M∞,2(1),
M∞,1 ⊕ M∞,1(1), or M0,1.

Proposition 4.8. HomA -dgstab(K, M∞,1(k)) = 0 for all k.

g
Proof. Again consider the triangle S
−→ S(2) → K → S(1) deﬁning K and write
g = f−1 + f−2. Applying HomA -dgstab(−, M∞,1), we again show that g∗(k) :
HomA -dgstab(S(2 + k), M∞,1) → HomA -dgstab(S(k), M∞,1) is an isomorphism
for all k. As in Proposition 4.7, we shall apply (−k) and work instead with g∗ :
∼=
HomA -dgstab(S(2), M∞,1(−k)) → HomA -dgstab(S, M∞,1(−k)). Since M∞,1
M∞,1(2), it sufﬁces to consider the cases k = 0 and k = 1.

If k = 1, both spaces are zero, and the result is immediate.

If k = 0,
both spaces are one-dimensional, so it is enough to show that g∗ is not the zero
map. The unique morphism S(2) → M∞,1 is (up to rescaling) of the form
h1 : S(2) → ΩM∞,1(1). Then g∗(h1) = (rn)n, where

Ω−1h1(−1) ◦ f−1
Ω−2h1(−2) ◦ f−2
0

rn = 


if n = 0
if n = −1
otherwise

A simple computation in A -grstab shows that r−1 = 0 and and r0 is a nonzero
element of HomA -grstab(S, M∞,1), whence g∗ is nonzero. Thus g∗ is an isomor-
phism in all cases, and so HomA -dgstab(K, M∞,1(k)) = 0 for all k.



Proposition 4.8 eliminates all remaining possibilities for K except for M0,1.

This ﬁnal possibility can be eliminated by proving:

Proposition 4.9. HomA -dgstab(K, M0,1) = 0

g
Proof. Once again, we consider the triangle S
−→ S(2) → K → S(1) deﬁning
K and write g = f−1 + f−2. We show g∗(k) : HomA -dgstab(S(2 + k), M0,1) →
HomA -dgstab(S(k), M0,1) is an isomorphism for all k. Applying (−k) and using
∼= M0,1(1), we show that g∗ : HomA -dgstab(S(2), M0,1) →
the identity M0,1
HomA -dgstab(S, M0,1) is an isomorphism. Since both spaces are one-dimensional,
it sufﬁces to show that the map is nonzero.

36

The generator of HomA -dgstab(S(2), M0,1) is h2 : S(2) → Ω2M0,1(2), and so

g∗(h2) = (rn)n, where

Ω−1h2(−1) ◦ f−1
Ω−2h2(−2) ◦ f−2
0

rn = 


if n = 1
if n = 0
otherwise

A straightforward computation shows that r1 = 0 and r0 is the generator of
HomA -dgstab(S, M0,1). Thus g∗ is an isomorphism and HomA -dgstab(K, M0,1) =
0.

5 Brauer Tree Algebras

In this section we shall prove that the functor FA of Theorem 3.10 is an equiv-
alence whenever the algebra A is any non-positively graded Brauer tree algebra.
We shall work over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k.

A Brauer tree consists of the data Γ = (T, e, v, m), where T is a tree, e is
the number of edges of T , v is a vertex of T , called the exceptional vertex, and
m is a positive integer, called the multiplicity of v. To any Brauer tree Γ, we can
associate a basic ﬁnite-dimensional symmetric algebra AΓ. For the details of this
process, we refer to [15].

An important special case is S = (S, n, v, m), the star with n edges and ex-
ceptional vertex at the center. In this case, the algebra AS is a Nakayama algebra
whose indecomposable projective modules have length nm + 1.

The following theorems are due to Bogdanic:

Theorem 5.1. (Bogdanic, [2], Theorem 4.3 and Lemma 4.9) Let S be the star
with n vertices and multiplicity m. Let AS be graded so that soc(AS) is in degree
nm. Let Γ be any Brauer tree with n vertices and multiplicity m. Then AΓ ad-
mits a non-negative grading such that soc(AΓ) is in degree nm, and there is an
equivalence Db(AS -grmod) → Db(AΓ -grmod).

Theorem 5.2. (Bogdanic, [2], Section 11) Let Γ be a Brauer tree with multiplicity
m. Then, up to graded Morita equivalence and rescaling, AΓ possesses a unique
grading. The socle of AΓ lies in degree dm for some d ∈ Z, and the grading is

37

determined up to graded Morita equivalence by d. If d > 0, the grading can be
chosen to be non-negative, and if d < 0 the grading can be chosen to be non-
positive.

From these facts, we obtain the following result:

Corollary 5.3. Let Γ be a Brauer tree. Let S be the star with the same multiplicity
and number of edges. Let AΓ and AS be graded so that soc(AΓ) and soc(AS) lie
in degree d for some d ∈ Z. Then we have equivalences of triangulated categories
Db(AS -grmod) → Db(AΓ -grmod) and AS -grstab → AΓ -grstab.
Theorem 5.4. Let Γ = (T, e, v, m) be a Brauer graph, and let AΓ be non-
positively graded with socle in degree −d ≤ 0. Then FAΓ is an equivalence.
Proof. If Γ is the star, then AΓ is a Nakayama algebra and the result follows
immediately from Lemma 4.6.
If Γ is not the star, let S denote the star with
the same number of edges and multiplicity as Γ. By Theorem 5.2 there is a
nonpositive grading on AS such that soc(AS) is in degree −d. Then by Theo-
rem 5.1, Db(AΓ -grmod) and Db(AS -grmod) are equivalent as triangulated cat-
egories. By a theorem of Rickard [13], this induces a triangulated equivalence
G : AΓ -grstab → AS -grstab which commutes with grading shifts. By Propo-
sition 3.21, G induces an equivalence between C(AΓ) and C(AS). Since AS is a
Nakayama algebra, it satisﬁes the hypotheses of Lemma 4.3, hence AΓ does as
well. Thus FAΓ is an equivalence.
Corollary 5.5. Let Γ be a Brauer tree, and let S be the star with the same multi-
plicity and number of edges. Let AΓ and AS both be graded with socle in degree
−d ≤ 0. Then AΓ -dgstab and AS -dgstab are equivalent as triangulated cate-
gories.

Proof. This follows from the use of Proposition 3.21 in the previous theorem.

6 The Dg-Stable Category of the Star with n Ver-

tices

For n ≥ 2, d ≥ 0, let A = An,d denote the graded Brauer tree algebra, with socle
in degree −d, corresponding to the star S with n edges and exceptional vertex of
multiplicity one. This speciﬁes A up to graded Morita equivalence; we will choose
a speciﬁc grading once we have adopted some more notation in the section below.
By the results of Section 5, A -dgstab is equivalent to C(A). We shall identify the
two categories throughout this section.

38

6.1 Notation, Indexing, and Grading

We index the edges of S by the set Z/nZ = {1, · · · , n}, according to their cyclic
order around the center vertex. We deﬁne a total order ≤ on Z/nZ by 1 < 2 <
· · · < n. This order is of course not compatible with the group operation on Z/nZ.
If P is a statement with a truth value, we deﬁne δP to be 1 if P is true and 0 if

P is false.

For x, y ∈ Z, deﬁne hx, yi to be the closed arc of the unit circle starting at
y. Thus hx, xi denotes a point,

x and proceeding counterclockwise to e

ai

With these deﬁnitions, the Ext-quiver of A is a directed cycle, C, of length n.
C has vertices ei and edges ei
for all i ∈ Z/nZ. A is isomorphic
ei+1
to, and will be identiﬁed with, the quotient of the path algebra of C by the ideal
generated by paths of length n + 1. Changing A up to graded Morita equivalence,
we determine the grading on A by deﬁning deg(ai) = −dδi=n. We denote by
Si the simple A-module corresponding to ei, in degree 0. We denote by Pi the
indecomposable projective module with head Si and socle Si(d).

The indecomposable A-modules are uniserial and determined, up to isomor-
phism, by their head and socle. For i, j ∈ Z/nZ, let M i
denote the indecompos-
j
able module with head Si and socle Sj(dδj<i). More speciﬁcally, for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n,
j to be the module eiA/eiJ l, where J is the Jacobson radical of A
we deﬁne M i
and l = δi>jn + 1 + j − i is the length of M i
j . The non-projective indecomposable
objects of A -grmod, up to grading shifts and isomorphism, are precisely M i
for
j
i, j ∈ Z/nZ.

j

Even when working in A -grstab, it will be helpful to deﬁne the ”length” of
, for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, to be l(M i
j ) = δi>jn + 1 + j − i.
Finally, we note that for 1 ≤ r, j ≤ n, the module M j+1−r

(−dδj6=r) has length
r and socle Sj in degree zero; we shall make extensive use of this module later on.

6.2 Structure of A -grstab

One of the desirable features of Brauer tree algebras is that the A-module ho-
momorphisms X → Y can be determined combinatorially from the composition
towers of X and Y , allowing quick and easy computation of morphisms. For
a more general and explicit description of this procedure, we refer to Crawley-
Boevey [5]. These techniques generalize easily to graded modules.

The following results about A -grstab follow from straightforward computa-

tion and are well-known. We state them without proof.

ators for the above Hom spaces. Fortunately, there are natural choices.

6.3 Structure of A -dgstab
Since Ω ∼= (−1) in A -dgstab, and Ω is periodic in A -grstab, it follows that (1)
is periodic in A -dgstab. The period depends both on n and d. This period is the

41

 
same for all indecomposable modules except when n is odd, in which case the
indecomposable modules of length n+1

2 have their period halved.

For any X ∈ A -dgstab, let ψ : X → X((n + 1)d + 2n) denote the map
induced by the natural isomorphism id → ((n + 1)d + 2n), whose unique nonzero
component is the identity map in degree −2n. For any X ∈ A -dgstab that can be

We immediately obtain the following corollary:

Proposition 6.10. Every indecomposable object of A -dgstab is isomorphic to
one of the following:
1) M 1
2) M 1

l (k) for 1 ≤ l < n+1
(k) for 0 ≤ k < P

2 and 0 ≤ k < P

Remark. The above list of objects are in fact pairwise non-isomorphic. We shall
prove this in Theorem 6.12.

Proof. By applying the identities in Proposition 6.9, we can express any modules
l (k) for some k ∈ Z and 1 ≤ l ≤ n+1
M i
2 . By Proposition 6.7, we can
reduce k mod P (l) until k lies in the desired range.

Since A is a Nakayama algebra, Lemma 4.6 guarantees that every morphism
between indecomposable objects X and Y can be represented by a map X →
ΩmY (m) in A -grstab for some unique m. To compute HomA -dgstab(M 1

we must determine which M i

gory, then express such M i

if h1, ji ⊂ hj + 1 − r, li and k = −dδ1<j+1−r = −dδj6=r. Thus it is enough to
show that the inequalities in the statement are equivalent to the arc containment

fl,r,j is an isomorphism if and only if l = r = j, in which case it is the identity

gl,l,l = ψ1/2. In particular, the indecomposable modules listed in Proposition 6.10
are pairwise non-isomorphic.

For r = n+1

2 and any value of l, the morphisms fl,r,j and gl,r,j are deﬁned for
the same values of j and represented by the same morphism in A -grstab. More
speciﬁcally, for each such j,

Apart from the above identities, all the fl,r,j and gl,r,j are distinct, in the sense
that their unique nonzero components cannot be transformed into one another by
applying powers of Ω and grading shifts.

r (k)) is nonzero if and

max(1, x + l − n) ≤ j ≤ min(x, l), and m ∈ Z. The only possibles values for

If j = r, then the desired identity is immediate.

If x = n + 1 − r, then the condition on j simpliﬁes to max(1, 1 + l − r) ≤
j ≤ l. For each such j we obtain the morphism gl,r,j whose nonzero component
is α1,j+r

If j = n + 1 − r, the restrictions on j, r, and l imply that j = l = r = n+1

the desired identity then follows from direct substitution and the fact that P (r) =
(n+1)d

2 + n. This establishes the descriptions of the Hom spaces.
We now determine the isomorphisms of A -dgstab. Note that a morphism is
an isomorphism in C(A) if and only if its unique nonzero component is an isomor-
phism in A -grstab. If fl,r,j is an isomorphism, α1,j+1−r
(−dδj6=r)
must also be an isomorphism. From Proposition 6.1, we have that j = r = l. Con-
versely, direct substitution shows that fl,l,l is the identity map.

This completes the description of the isomorphisms of A -dgstab. It follows

immediately that M 1

If r = n+1

2 , the identity gl,r,j = ψ1/2 ◦ fl,r,j follows immediately from direct
substitution, as does the fact that f and g are deﬁned for the same values of j. (We
note that both morphisms have the same domain, codomain, and nonzero compo-
nent.) If l = n+1
2 , the corresponding statement follows from similar computations.
To show distinctness, suppose that we can transform the nonzero component
fl,r,j into that of gl′,r′,j′ by applying grading shifts and Ωm for some even integer
m. We shall show that l = l′, j = j′, and r = r′ = n+1
In order for the

domains to be equal, we must have that l = l′ and m is a multiple of 2n. By
using periodicity of Ω and changing the grading shift, we can also assume without
loss of generality that m = 0. For the codomains to be equal, we must have in
particular that M j+1−r

Similarly, suppose we can transform the nonzero component of fl,r,j into that

2 , r = r′, and j = j′ + r′ − n+1

Next, suppose that we can transform the nonzero component fl,r,j into that of
gl′,r′,j′ by applying grading shifts and Ωm for some odd integer m. We shall show
that l = l′ = n+1
2 . In order for the domains to
be equal, their lengths, n + 1 − l and l′, respectively, must be equal. This implies
that n is odd and l = l′ = n+1
2 . Furthermore, m must be an odd multiple of n;
without loss of generality, we may assume that m = n by periodicity. Observing

desired.

If we can transform the nonzero component of fl,r,j into that of fl′,r′,j′ by
applying a grading shift and Ωm for some odd m, by considering the lengths of
the domain and codomain, we must have that l = l′ = r = r′ = n+1
2 . We
can again assume that m = n. Observing the codomains, we must have that

A morphism M 1

r (k) is indecomposable if and only if its nonzero com-

To verify the composition formulas, we translate them into statements about

A -grstab and use Proposition 6.4.

We start with Equation (12). A tedious but straightforward computation using

Proposition 6.5 shows that the only possible nonzero component of

l → M 1

l,q+j−r

j,q+j−r

(−dδj6=r) ◦ α1,j+1−r

is αj+1−r,(q+j−r)+1−c
. Then by Proposition 6.4, this composi-
tion is nonzero if and only if h1, q + j − ri ⊂ h(q + j − r) + 1 − c, li, in which case
it is equal to α1,(q+j−r)+1−c
. Since the codomain of this morphism has length c, it
follows that the resulting morphism, if nonzero, is equal to fl,c,q+j−r. It remains to
verify that the arc containment condition is equivalent to the desired inequality. If
q +j −r < 1, then the restrictions on q, j, r, and l imply that l −n < q +j −r < 1,
hence both the desired inequality and the arc containment condition are false. If
q + j − r ≥ 1, the restrictions on q, j, l, r, and r imply that 1 ≤ q + j − r ≤ n
and c + l − n ≤ 1. We can then apply Proposition 6.11 and conclude the arc
containment condition is equivalent to the inequality 1 ≤ q + j − r ≤ min(c, l).
Thus Equation (12) holds.

Proceeding to Equation (13), the only possible nonzero component of

gr,c,q((d + 2)(r − j)) ◦ fl,r,j : M 1

l → M 1

c ((d + 2)(n + 1 − (q + j − r)) − 1)

(−dδj6=r) ◦ α1,j+1−r

. This composition is nonzero if and only
if h1, q + j − ri ⊂ h(q + j − r) + c, li, in which case it is equal to α1,(q+j−r)+c
.
The codomain of this component has length n + 1 − c, hence the composition,
if nonzero, is equal to gl,c,q+j−r. The same argument as above shows that the
arc containment condition is equivalent to the inequality max(1, 1 + l − c) ≤
q + j − r ≤ l. Thus Equation (13) holds.

l,q+j−r

For Equation (14), the only possible nonzero component of

fr,c,q((d + 2)(n + 1 − j) − 1) ◦ gl,r,j : M 1

j − ci ⊂ hq + j, li, in which case it is equal to α1,q+j
. The codomain of this
component has length n + 1 − c, hence the composition, if nonzero, is equal to
gl,c,q+j−c. The same argument as above shows that the arc containment condition
is equivalent to the inequality max(1, 1 + l − c) ≤ q + j − c ≤ l. Thus Equation
(14) holds.

l,q+j−c

For Equation (15), the only possible nonzero component of

gr,c,q((d + 2)(n + 1 − j) − 1) ◦ gl,r,j : M 1

l → M 1

c ((d + 2)(2(n + 1) − q − j) − 2)

h1, q + j + c − 1i ⊂ hq + j, li, in which case it is equal to α1,q+j

. This composition is nonzero if and only if

. It is clear

l,q+j+c−1

49

that the desired inequality implies the arc containment condition; we now show
the converse. Due to the restrictions on q, j, and c, we have that 2 ≤ q + j ≤
q + j + c − 1 ≤ l + n and q + j ≤ n + 1. Thus if q + j ≤ l, we have that
1 < q + j ≤ l, and the arc containment condition fails. Thus we must have that
l < q + j ≤ n + 1. If l < q + j + c − 1 ≤ n + 1, then the arc containment condition
fails, hence we must also have n + 1 ≤ q + j + c − 1. The desired inequality
follows immediately. Thus the arc containment condition and the desired equality
are equivalent. If both hold, the codomain of the nonzero component has length
c. We also have that 1 ≤ q + j + c − (n + 1) ≤ min(c, l). Thus the composition
is equal to ψ ◦ fl,c,q+j+c−(n+1). To explain the presence of ψ in this formula, note
that the grading shift of the codomain of the composition is

(d + 2)(2(n+ 1) −q −j) −2 = [(d + 2)(c −(q + j + c −(n+ 1)))] + [(n+ 1)d + 2n]

The factor of ψ accounts for the second bracketed term.

Computing the cones of the morphisms in Theorem 6.12 is straightforward,

since the computations can be done in A -grstab.

We have described the indecomposable objects and morphisms of A -dgstab
in Theorem 6.12; by two easy counting arguments (n even and n odd), there are
nP
2 indecomposable objects in A -dgstab. A description of the Auslander-Reiten
quiver A -dgstab follows easily.

Deﬁnition 6.14. For positive integers N, M, let QN,M denote the quiver with
vertex set V = Z/NZ×{1, · · · , M} and arrows of the form (x, y) → (x+1, y+1)
for 1 ≤ y < M and (x, y) → (x, y − 1) for 1 < y ≤ M.

Corollary 6.15. If d is even, the Auslander-Reiten quiver of A -dgstab is the cylin-
der Q P

where τ is the involution sending (x, y) to (x − y + P +n+1
, n + 1 − y). The
indecomposable morphisms representing the arrows can be chosen such that all
squares commute (up to powers of ψ), and a composition of arrows out of vertex

The Auslander-Reiten quiver of A -dgstab for n = 3, d = 1.
Corresponding numbered vertices are identiﬁed.

Proof. An easy counting argument shows that there are exactly P n
2 indecompos-
able objects in A -dgstab (regardless of parity of n), and that there are P n
2 vertices
in the corresponding candidate quivers. We ﬁrst make explicit the bijection be-
tween vertices and indecomposable objects.

For d even, x ∈ Z/ P

y ((d+2)x) ∼= M 1

2 Z, and 1 ≤ y ≤ n, associate the vertex (x, y) with the
object M 1
y ((d + 2)x); the isomorphism class of this object is independent of the
choice of representative of x since d + 2 is even. For ⌊ n+1
2 ⌋ < y ≤ n, note that
M 1
2 ⌋.
Since (n + 1)(d + 2) ≡ 2 in Z/P Z and both d and P are even, we have that
(d + 2) = (2) is an index 2 subgroup of Z/P Z. Thus, for ﬁxed 1 < y < n+1

the above mapping sends {(x, y) | 0 ≤ x < P

When d is odd, associate the vertex (x, y) of QP,n to the object M 1

y ((d + 2)x).
Note that d + 2 is odd and hd + 2i ⊃ h2i in Z/P Z; therefore d + 2 generates
Z/P Z. Thus, for each 1 ≤ y ≤ n, the above mapping establishes a bijection
between {(x, y) | 0 ≤ x < P } and {M 1
y (i) | 0 ≤ i < P }. In particular, we
have a two-to-one map from the vertices of QP,n to the indecomposable objects
of A -dgstab. Furthermore, a straightforward computation using Equation (8) of
Lemma 6.9 shows that (x, y) and τ (x, y) have the same image. Thus the map
deﬁnes a bijection between the vertices of QP,n/τ are the indecomposable objects
of A -dgstab.

It remains to show that the edges of the candidate quivers correspond to the
indecomposable morphisms. For d of arbitrary parity, every length one indecom-
posable object of A -dgstab has one indecomposable morphism in and out; all
other objects have two indecomposable morphisms in and out. Thus the degrees
of the vertices in the Auslander-Reiten quiver agree with the degrees of the ver-
tices of the candidate quivers. Note that both candidate quivers are symmetric
about the central line y = n+1
y = min{y, n + 1 − y}.
2 . For a vertex (x, y), let
For vertices (x, y) which do not lie on the central line, it is straightforward to
verify that shifts of the indecomposable morphism fey,ey−1,ey−1 correspond to the
arrows exiting (x, y) and pointing away from the central line. Similarly, shifts of
the morphism fey,ey+1,ey correspond to the arrows pointing towards the central line,
correspond to arrows crossing the central line. For vertices of

this assignment in the quiver QP,n, since τ swaps vertical and diagonal arrows.
The resulting assignment is compatible with τ by Equation (11). This establishes
the isomorphism of directed graphs between the Auslander-Reiten quiver and the
candidate quivers.

With the above assignment of morphisms to the arrows of the Auslander-
Reiten quiver, it follows directly from the composition formulas in Theorem 6.12
that all squares commute, up to powers of ψ.

To determine when a composition is zero, it sufﬁces to consider compositions
starting at the vertex (0, y), 1 ≤ y ≤ n. Suppose d is even, and choose a com-
position of morphisms starting at (0, y) and consisting of s vertical arrows and t

diagonal arrows. We may choose to represent the vertex (0, y) by the module M 1
y ;
in this case a vertical arrow has as its unique nonzero component the canonical
morphism M 1
y−1 in A -grstab, and a diagonal arrow has unique nonzero
component M 1
y (−d). Thus a morphism consisting of 0 ≤ s < y verti-
cal arrows and 0 ≤ t < n + 1 − y diagonal arrows has the canonical morphism
M 1
y−s(−dδt>0) as its unique nonzero component. When s = y, the com-
position becomes zero in A -grmod, and when t = n + 1 − y, it becomes zero
in A -grstab; in either case, the morphism vanishes in A -dgstab. For s > y
or t > n + 1 − y, the morphism factors through a morphism with s = y or
t = n + 1 − y, hence is zero.

y → M 1−t

When d is odd, the automorphism τ sends vertical arrows to diagonal ones and
vice-versa, hence the notion of ”vertical” and ”diagonal” arrows are only locally
deﬁned. However, once a local choice of deﬁnition is made at the vertex (0, y),
the argument in the preceding paragraph applies without change.

I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to Rapha¨el Rouquier for suggesting the
topic of this paper, for providing constant support and encouragement during its
writing, and for teaching me homological algebra.

I would also like to thank Torkil Stai for helpful comments regarding the uni-
versal property of the triangulated hull, which led to a substantial revision (and
hopefully improvement!) of Section 3.
