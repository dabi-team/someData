ABSTRACT

The binary system 16 Cygni is key in studies of the planet-star chemical composition connection, as only one of the
stars is known to host a planet. This allows us to better assess the possible inﬂuence of planet interactions on the
chemical composition of stars that are born from the same cloud and thus, should have a similar abundance pattern.
In our previous work, we found clear abundance diﬀerences for elements with Z≤ 30 between both components of this
system, and a trend of these abundances as a function of the condensation temperature (Tc), which suggests a spectral
chemical signature related to planet formation. In this work we show that our previous ﬁndings are still consistent
even if we include more species, like the volatile N and neutron capture elements (Z > 30). We report a slope with Tc
of 1.56 ± 0.24 × 10−5 dex K−1, that is good agreement with both our previous work and recent results by Nissen and
collaborators. We also performed some tests using ARES and iSpec to automatic measure the equivalent width and
found Tc slopes in reasonable agreement with our results as well. In addition, we determine abundances for Li and Be
by spectral synthesis, ﬁnding that 16 Cyg A is richer not only in Li but also in Be, when compared to its companion.
This may be evidence of planet engulfment, indicating that the Tc trend found in this binary system may be a chemical
signature of planet accretion in the A component, rather than a imprint of the giant planet rocky core formation on 16
Cyg B.

1. Introduction

The most accepted hypothesis of star formation is the neb-
ular collapse, when stars are formed from gravitationally
unstable molecular clouds. Therefore, it is expected that
stars that are born from the same interstellar material cloud
should have the same abundance pattern during the Main
Sequence, with exception of the light elements Li and Be,
that can be destroyed in regions deeper than the convective
zone, in solar type stars. Thereby, diﬀerences in the chem-
ical content of stars born from the same natal cloud, may
suggest that extra processes, that are not necessary con-
nected to stellar evolution, may have inﬂuenced its photo-
spheric chemical composition. In particular, planet forma-
tion or planet engulfment may imprint important chemical
signatures in the host star.

Such phenomenon is expected to leave subtle signs on
the stellar abundance pattern, of the order of 0.01 dex
(Chambers 2010), that can only be detected with a high-
precision analysis. This can only be achieved with the dif-
ferential method (Nissen & Gustafsson 2018), that requires
a comparison between the target star with a similar star
of known parameters, that will serve as the standard for
the abundance calculations. So, the sample should be re-

stricted to objects that are very similar among themselves,
like in the case of solar twins1.

Following this premise, Mel´endez et al. (2009) analyzed
the abundances of 11 solar twins, achieving a high-precision
abundance determination, with uncertainties of ∼ 0.01 dex,
and found not only a depletion of refractory elements, when
compared to the average of the sample, but also a trend
with condensation temperature (Tc). The authors sug-
gested that the correlation of the refractory elements abun-
dances with condensation temperature is probably due to
rocky planet formation. This hypothesis has been corrobo-
rated by Chambers (2010), who showed that the depleted
material in the Sun’s convective zone is comparable to the
mass of terrestrial planets of our Solar System (see also
Galarza et al. (2016)).

However, other hypothesis have been proposed to ex-
plain the abundance trend, like the stellar environment in
which the star was formed ( ¨Onehag et al. 2014), although
according to the recent theoretical estimates by Gustafsson
(2018), the mechanism is hardly signiﬁcant; dust segrega-
tion in the protostellar disc (Gaidos 2015); the inﬂuence
of the stellar age (Adibekyan et al. 2014); and the planet
engulfment scenario (Spina et al. 2015).

1 More recently, solar twins have been deﬁned as stars with
eﬀective temperature within 100K; log g and [Fe/H] within 0.1
dex from the Sun (Ram´ırez et al. 2014).

In this context, twin stars in binary systems are ex-
tremely important, because the eﬀects connected to the
stellar environment of its formation and to the Galaxy
chemical evolution, would be canceled out in a compara-
tive analysis between both components. Thus, investigat-
ing wide binaries can bring more light into the subject of
planets interactions (or other astrophysical event) inﬂuenc-
ing photospheric abundance of their host stars.

Some authors have already reported a Tc trend on bi-
nary stars. Teske et al. (2016) found an abundance trend
on the WASP94 system, where both stars are planet hosts.
The planet-hosting binaries XO-2N/XO-2S (Ram´ırez et al.
2015; Biazzo et al. 2015; Teske et al. 2015), HD 133131A/B
(Teske et al. 2016b) and HAT-P-4 (Saﬀe et al. 2017), also
show chemical anomalies most likely due to planets, and
the binary ζ 1,2 Ret, where one of the stars hosts a debris
disk, also shows a trend with condensation temperature
(Saﬀe et al. 2016; Adibekyan et al. 2016). Albeit no dif-
ferences have been found in the HAT-P-1 (Liu et al. 2014),
HD80606/HD80607 (Saﬀe et al. 2015; Mack et al. 2016)
and HD20782/HD20781 (Mack et al. 2014) and HD 106515
(Saﬀe et al. 2019), the evidences are inconclusive in the lat-
ter three due to the high abundance errors. Indeed, a more
precise abundance analysis of the pair HD80606/HD80607
by Liu et al. (2018), shows small but detectable abundance
diﬀerences between the binary components. A binary sys-
tem of twin stars with large abundance diﬀerences, is HD
240429/HD 240430 (Oh et al. 2018), for which no planets
are known yet. Furthermore, it was found that Kepler-
10, a star hosting a rocky planet, is deﬁcient in refractory
elements when compared to stars with similar stellar pa-
rameters and from the same stellar population (Liu et al.
2016).

For 16 Cygni, a binary pair of solar twins, where the B
component hosts a giant planet (Cochram & Hatzes 1997),
Laws & Gonzalez (2001) clearly detected that 16 Cyg A is
more metal rich ∆[Fe/H] = +0.025±0.009 dex than its com-
panion. Later, Ram´ırez et al. (2011) expanded the analysis
to 23 chemical elements, showing abundance diﬀerences in
all of them by about +0.04 dex and ﬁnding a TC trend
similar to Mel´endez et al. (2009), when the binary stars are
compared to the Sun. This was conﬁrmed in our previous
work (Tucci Maia et al. 2014), where we show that 16 Cyg
A is 0.047 ± 0.005 dex metal richer than B and also ﬁnding
a Tc slope of +1.99 ± 0.79 × 10−5 dex K−1 for the refractory
elements, as reported in Ram´ırez et al. (2011)). This result
was then associated with the rocky core formation of the
gas giant 16 Cyg Bb. Recently, Nissen et al. (2017) also
found a ∆[Fe/H](A-B)= +0.031 ± 0.010 dex and a Tc slope
of +0.98 ± 0.35 × 10−5 dex K−1.

In contrast, there are studies that challenge the metal-
licity diﬀerence and the Tc trend between the two compo-
nents of this system. Schuler et al. (2011) ﬁnd a Tc trend
for both stars relative to the Sun but, however, do not ﬁnd
any signiﬁcant abundance diﬀerences between the pair, in
agreement with Deliyannis et al. (2000) and Takeda et al.
(2011). Also, Adibekyan et al. (2016), analyzing the case
of ζ 1,2 Ret, argues that the Tc slope trend could be due
to nonphysical factors and related to the quality of spectra
employed, which is expected as high precision abundances
can only be obtained in spectra of adequate quality.

In this context, the initial motivation for this work is to
assess if, by revisiting this binary system now with better

data with higher resolving power, higher S/N and broader
spectral coverage, our previous results (obtained with lower
resolving power) would still be consistent; in addition to
provide improvements in the precision of the abundance de-
termination, we include the analysis of elements that were
not available before. We also challenge our results by em-
ploying automated tools to derive stellar parameters and
Tc while using the same methodology in all of the cases.

On the following sections, we will present the diﬀerential
abundances of 34 elements and also the abundances of Li
and Be, through spectral synthesis, which may present a
possible evidence of planetary engulfment on 16 Cyg A.

2. Data and analysis

2.1. Observations and data reduction

The observations of 16 Cyg A and B were carried out with
the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS; Noguchi et al.
2002) on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope of the National As-
tronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), located at the
Mauna Kea summit, in June 2015. Besides the 16 Cyg bi-
nary system, we also observed the asteroid Vesta, which
was used as an initial reference for our diﬀerential analysis.
For the optical, we obtained an S/N ratio of ∼ 750 at
600nm and ∼ 1000 at 670nm (Li region), on the highest
resolution possible (R∼160 000) using the 0.2” slit. The UV
observations with HDS were made using the 0.4” slit, which
provides a R = 90 000 that results in an S/N∼350 per pixel
at 340 nm, corresponding to the NH region, and S/N∼200
at 310 nm (Be region). This gave us the opportunity to
analyze volatile elements like nitrogen and neutron-capture
elements in the UV with S/N > 300.

The stars from the binary system and the Sun (Vesta)
were both observed using the same instrumental setup to
minimize errors in a diﬀerential analysis, which requires
comparisons between the spectra of all sample stars for the
continuum placement and comparison of the line proﬁles, to
achieve consistent equivalent width (EW) measurements.

The extraction of the orders and wavelength calibration
were performed immediately after the observations by Sub-
aru staﬀ, with routines available at the observatory. The
continuum normalization and Doppler correction were per-
formed using standard routines with IRAF.

2.2. Stellar parameters

Our method to determine stellar parameters and elemental
abundances follows the approach described on previous pa-
pers (e.g.; Ram´ırez et al. 2011, 2014; Mel´endez et al. 2009,
2012; Tucci Maia et al. 2016; Spina et al. 2016), by impos-
ing diﬀerential excitation and ionization equilibrium for Fe
I and Fe II lines (Figure 1). Since the 16 Cygni system is
a pair of solar twins, they have similar physical character-
istics to the Sun, and thus we initially used the Sun as a
reference for our analysis.

The abundance determination was performed by us-
ing the line-by-line diﬀerential method, employing the EW
manually measured by ﬁtting Gaussian proﬁles with the
IRAF splot task and deblending when necessary. Very spe-
cial care was taken for the continuum placement during
the measurements, always comparing and overplotting the
spectral lines region for the sample, focusing on a consistent
determination.

Tucci Maia et al.: Revisiting the 16 Cygni

Table 1 shows the stellar parameters obtained for 16 Cyg
A and B using the Sun (Te f f = 5777 K, log g = 4.44 dex,
[Fe/H] = 0.0 dex) as reference. Note that these results are
practically the same within the errors as the ones found in
Tucci Maia et al. (2014), which are Te f f = 5830 ± 7 K, log
g = 4.30 ± 0.02 and [Fe/H] = 0.101 ± 0.008 dex for 16 Cyg
A, and Te f f = 5751 ± 7 K, log g = 4.35 ± 0.02 and [Fe/H]
= 0.054 ± 0.008 dex for 16 Cyg B. The ﬁnal diﬀerence in
metallicity between the components of this binary system
is remarkably similar to the one reported in Tucci Maia
et al. (2014), that is ∆ [Fe/H] = 0.047 ± 0.005 dex, while
we ﬁnd in this work ∆[Fe/H] = 0.040 ± 0.006 dex. This
conﬁrms with a signiﬁcance of ∼ 7σ that 16 Cyg A is indeed
more metal rich when compared to 16 Cyg B, in agreement
with Ram´ırez et al. (2011) and the earlier work by Laws &
Gonzalez (2001), as well as the recent work by Nissen et al.
(2017).

2.3. Trigonometric surface gravity

New parallaxes for the binary stars of 16 Cygni have been
measured by the Gaia mission DR 2 (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2018). The new values are 47.2771 ± 0.0327 mas and
47.2754 ± 0.0245 mas for 16 Cyg A and B, respectively.
Adopting the magnitudes from the General Catalogue of
Photometric Data (GCPD; Mermilliod et al. 1997) with
V(A) = 5.959 ± 0.009 and V(B) = 6.228 ± 0.019, we de-
termined the absolute magnitudes MA = 4.332 ± 0.012 and
MB = 4.599 ± 0.026. Using this information with the values
of the Te f f , metallicity and mass, we estimate the trigono-
metric surface gravity for the pair of stars. For 16 Cyg A
we found log g(AT ) = 4.293 ± 0.005 dex and for 16 Cyg A
log g(BT ) = 4.364 ± 0.006. Notice that, while the surface
gravity for 16 Cyg B has a good agreement with the one
found through the ionization equilibrium of Fe lines (Ta-
ble 1), for 16 Cyg A the trigonometric value is ∼ 0.02 dex
lower, albeit they agree within 1.5 σ. Comparing with the
results of Ram´ırez et al. (2011), both the trigonometric and
Fe-lines-based surface gravity are in agreement for the A
component, while our surface gravities for B are somewhat
higher in both cases.

2.4. Age, mass and radius

The age and mass of the binary stars were determined us-
ing customized Yonsei-Yale isochrones (Yi et al. 2001), as
described in Ram´ırez et al. (2013, 2014). This method pro-
vides good relative ages, due to the high precision achieved
for the atmospheric parameters. We estimate the ages
and masses with probability distribution functions, through
the comparison of atmospheric parameters position of the
star with the values predicted by the isochrones. Initially,
the calculations were based on the [Fe/H], Teﬀ and log g,
and later we replaced the gravity by the parallax values
and magnitudes, to obtain the isochronal ages using the
absolute magnitudes. The results are shown in Table 1.
Our masses and radii shows a very good agreement when
compared to the asteroseismology determinations of MA =
1.08 ± 0.02M(cid:12), MB = 1.04 ± 0.02M(cid:12), RA = 1.229 ± 0.008R(cid:12)
and RB = 1.116 ± 0.006R(cid:12), as reported by Metcalfe et al.
(2015).

The inferred isochronal ages of A and B based on log
g, are 6.0 ± 0.3 Gyr and 6.7 ± 0.4 Gyr, respectively. This

Excitation and ionization equilibrium of Fe abun-
dances (manually measured) using the Sun as the standard star
for 16 Cyg A. Crosses represent Fe I and ﬁlled circles Fe II.

With the measured EW, we ﬁrst determined the Fe I
and Fe II abundances to diﬀerentially obtain the stellar pa-
rameters. For this we employed the 2014 version of the
LTE code MOOG (Sneden 1973) with the MARCS grid of
1D-LTE model atmospheres (Gustafsson et al. 2008). It is
important to highlight that the choice of a particular at-
mospheric model has a minor impact on the determination
of stellar parameters and chemical abundances in a strictly
diﬀerential analysis, as long the stars that are being studied
are similar to the star of reference (e.g. Tucci Maia et al.
2016).

To make the analysis more eﬃcient, we employed the
Python q2 code2 (Ram´ırez et al. 2014), which operates in
a semi-automatic mode, by calling MOOG routines to de-
termine the elemental abundances and perform a line-by-
line diﬀerential analysis using these results. This code also
performs corrections of hyperﬁne structure (HFS) and the
determination of uncertainties. In this work, we take into
account the HFS for V, Mn, Co, Cu, Y, Ag, La and Pr
using the line list from Mel´endez et al. (2012). The er-
rors are computed considering both observational (due to
uncertainties in the measurements, represented by the stan-
dard error) and systematic uncertainties (from the stellar
parameters and their inter-dependences), as described in in
Ram´ırez et al. (2015). Observational and systematic errors
are added in quadrature.

shows that both components of the system have roughly
the same age (within error bars). We have also estimated
the ages of 16 Cyg A and B using the correlation of [Y/Mg]
and [Y/Al] as a function of stellar age. The abundance clock
[Y/Mg] for solar-type stars was ﬁrst suggested by da Silva et
al. (2012) and the correlation between [Y/Mg] or [Y/Al] and
stellar age was quantiﬁed for solar twins by Nissen (2015),
Tucci Maia et al. (2016) and Spina et al. (2016) 3. The
derived [Y/Mg] ages are A= 6.2 Gyr and B= 6.3 Gyr using
the relation of Tucci Maia et al. (2016). Similar ages are
found using the Spina et al. (2016) relations, A= 6.0 ±1.0
Gyr and B= 6.1 ±1.0 Gyr. These results are consistent with
the values calculated using the isochronal method, while the
[Y/Al] ages (Spina et al. 2016) give A =6.6 ±1.0 Gyr and
B= 6.8 ±1.0 Gyr. The values of age, mass and radius are
in agreement with asteroseismic with values around 7 Gyrs
(van Saders et al. 2016; Bellinger et al. 2017), with 16 Cyg
A being slightly more massive and with bigger radius than
its companion.

2.5. Activity

The chromospheric activity is an important constrain on
stellar ages (Lorenzo-Oliveira et al. 2018). In order to mea-
sure the activity diﬀerences between 16 Cyg A and B, we
deﬁned an instrumental activity index based on Hα line
which is a well-known chromospheric indicator of late-type
stars (Pasquini & Pallavicini 1991; Lyra & Porto de Mello
2005; Montes et al. 2001):

H =

FHα
(FB + FV)

,

(1)

where FHα is the ﬂux integrated around the Hα line (∆λ
= 6562.78 ± 0.3 ˚A). We chose this narrow spectral inter-
val to minimize the eﬀective temperature eﬀects that might
be present along the Hα wings4. FB and FV are the ﬂuxes
3 Notice that the correlation between [Y/Mg] and age is only
valid for solar-metallicity stars (Feltzing et al. 2017)
4 Small residual photospheric eﬀects are still expected to be
aﬀecting our index measurements, however, this residual feature
should have negligible impact on our results since we are not

integrated around 0.3 ˚A continuum windows, centered at
6500.375 and 6625.550 ˚A, respectively. In table 2, we show
the estimated H for 16 Cyg AB and the Sun. The uncer-
tainties were estimated by quadratic error propagation of
equation 1, assuming Poisson error distribution.

Accordingly to H , none of 16 Cyg components show
unexpected level of chromospheric activity for a typical 6-7
Gyr-old star (Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008). Furthermore,
16 Cyg A and B seem to be chromospherically quiet stars
(H = 0.188 ± 0.001) and slightly more inactive than the
Sun (H = 0.1909 ± 0.0019), indicating a chromospheric
age older than 4-5 Gyr. This result is in line with Ca II H
& K multi-epoch observations of Isaacson & Fischer (2010)
who found log(R(cid:48)
HK) ≈ -5.05 dex for this system, in good
agreement with the mean activity level of log(R(cid:48)
HK) = -5.03
± 0.1 dex derived for 49 solar-type stars from the 6-7 Gyr
old open cluster NGC 188 (Lorenzo-Oliveira et al. 2016b).
We inspected the chromospheric signature of other clas-
sical indicators along the spectral coverage of our observa-
tions such as Ca II H & K (Mamajek & Hillenbrand 2008;
Lorenzo-Oliveira et al. 2016b), Hβ (Montes et al. 2001) and
Ca II infrared triplet (Lorenzo-Oliveira et al. 2016). All of
them show the same behavior found by Hα lines, 16 Cyg A
and B are chromospherically older than the Sun (age > 4-5
Gyr) and the activity diﬀerences between the components
are negligible. In summary, the diﬀerent activity indicators
reinforce the age results from isochrones and seismology.

3. Abundance analysis

We present high-precision abundances for the light elements
C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni,
Cu and Zn; and the heavy elements Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ru, Rh,
Pd, Ag, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, and Dy. The abundances
of these elements were diﬀerentially determined using ini-
tially the Sun as our standard star and then using 16 Cyg
B as the reference to obtain the ∆[X/H](A−B). The calcu-
lations were performed with the same method as described
for the iron lines (see also Tucci Maia et al. (2016)).

Taking into account only the elements with Z ≤ 30, there
is a clear chemical trend as a function of the condensation
temperature (Tc) in the pattern of both stars relative to the
Sun (Figure 2), in agreement with Ram´ırez et al. (2011),
Schuler et al. (2011) and Tucci Maia et al. (2014). In ad-
dition to results based on atomic lines, abundances for the
volatiles elements C, N, and O were also determined using
the molecules CH, NH and OH (red triangles in Figures 2
and 4). There is a very good agreement between the C and
O abundances based on high excitation atomic lines and
low excitation molecular lines, while for N we only present

interested in absolute activity scale determination for a wide
range of eﬀective temperatures.

tween atomic and molecular-based diﬀerential abundances

restrial planets in the solar system (see also further work
by Ram´ırez et al. (2009, 2010)). However, in the litera-
ture, there are diﬀerent suggestions for the Sun’s abundance
trend with condensation temperature.

3.1. Abundance vs. condensation temperature trend

A possible indication of rocky planet formation (or planet
engulfment) can be found in the distribution of the diﬀer-
ential elemental abundances as a function of condensation
temperature. Refractory elements have high condensation
temperature (TC (cid:38) 900 K), easily forming dust, being thus
an important component of rocky bodies. Terrestrial plan-
ets (or the core of giant planets) may inﬂuence the surface
i) the accretion
abundance of its host star in two ways:
of rocky material (planetary engulfment) depleted of hy-
drogen that enrich the stellar atmosphere in refractories
(e.g., Spina et al. 2015; Mel´endez et al. 2017; Petrovich
& Mu˜noz 2017); ii) imprisonment of refractory rich mate-
rial into rocky objects (i.e, planetesimals, rocky planets,
core of giant planets), that deplete the material accreted
by the star during its formation (e.g., Mel´endez et al. 2009;
Ram´ırez et al. 2011; Tucci Maia et al. 2014). In the case of
planet engulfment, the thermohaline mixing should dilute
the overabundance in a few milion year (Th´eado & Vau-
clair 2012), however, the thermohaline mixing could not be
as eﬀective and still leave some enhancement on the outer
layers of the star, that can only be detected with a precision
of ∼ 0.01 dex.

An important point to highlight is that the signature of
planet formation or planet engulfment is directly connected
to the size of the convective zone during the event.
If a
solar-mass protostar would go through a fully convective
phase that would last longer than the lifetime of the pro-
toplanetary disk (as it is conventionally accepted; Hayashi
1961), any event of planetary formation that occur during
such phase would be masked by a signiﬁcant dilution with
the stellar material enclosed into the convective zone, which
would homogenize the chemical content throughout the star
(see Figure 2 of Spina et al. 2015).

In contrast to the classic steady accretion, there is the
scenario of episodic material accretion onto the star (with
observational evidence reported by Liu et al. (2016b)).
Models that include episodic accretion can reach the sta-
bilization of the convective zone earlier than 10 Myr with
initial mass of 10MJup and accretion rate bursts of 5 ×
10−4 M(cid:12)yr−1, reaching a ﬁnal mass of 1 M(cid:12) (Baraﬀe &
Chabrier 2010). Although is an extreme of their models, it
is important to highlight that due to the eﬀects of episodic
accretion, the higher the mass of the accretion rate bursts
for a given initial mass (or lower the initial mass for a given
accretion rate) the greater the impact on the internal struc-
ture, reaching the necessary central temperature for the de-
velopment of the radiative core (∼ 2−3×106 K) earlier than
what is predicted by the model of a non accreting star (see
Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 of Baraﬀe & Chabrier 2010). This eﬀect
makes plausible the assumption that the formation of rocky
bodies can chemically alter the surface abundance pattern
of its parent star.

Following this premise, Mel´endez et al. (2009) suggested
that the depletion of refractory elements in the Sun, when
compared to a sample of 11 solar twins (without infor-
mation regarding planets), is due to the formation of ter-

Adibekyan et al. (2014) proposed that the trend with
condensation temperature is an eﬀect of the chemical evo-
lution of the Galaxy or depends on the star’s birthplace.
Investigating the inﬂuence of age on solar twins, Nissen
(2015) found a strong correlation of α and s-process ele-
ments abundances with stellar age, ﬁndings that were con-
ﬁrmed by Tucci Maia et al. (2016) and Spina et al. (2016).
According to ¨Onehag et al. (2014), if the star is formed in a
dense stellar environment, the gas of the proto-stellar disk
could have its dust cleansed before its birth by radiation
of hot stars in the cluster, but recent theoretical estimates
by Gustafsson (2018), suggest that the mechanism is not
signiﬁcant. Gaidos (2015) associate this eﬀect to the gas-
dust segregation in the protoplanetary disk. Maldonado
& Villaver (2016) ﬁnd diﬀerences in the Tc-slopes of re-
fractory elements between stars with and without known
planets, but this eﬀect depends on the evolutionary stage,
since it has been detected on main-sequence and subgiant
stars, while no trend is found in their sample of giants. The
authors also suggest that there is a correlation of both the
mass and age, with Tc.

In this context, the investigation of abundance peculiar-
ities in binary stars with and without planets is essential,
because in a binary system there is no eﬀect due to the
chemical evolution of the Galaxy and other external fac-
tors, because it would equally aﬀect both stars and thus be
minimized in a diﬀerential analysis. In this sense, the 16
Cygni system is a very interesting case, where both com-
ponents are solar twins with the same age from asteroseis-
mology (van Saders et al. 2016). On top of that, 16 Cyg
B has a detected giant planet with a minimal mass of 1.5
Jupiter mass (Cochram & Hatzes 1997) while 16 Cyg A has
no planet detected up to now, being thus a key target to
study the eﬀect of planets on the chemical composition of
stars.

However, the abundance pattern of 16 Cyg A relative to
B is still a controversy. A few authors suggest that there is
no diﬀerence on the metallicity of the pair (Deliyannis et al.
2000; Schuler et al. 2011; Takeda et al. 2011), while most
found abundance diﬀerences of about 0.05 dex (Nissen et al.
2017; Adibekyan et al. 2016; Mishenina et al. 2016; Tucci
Maia et al. 2014; Ram´ırez et al. 2011; Laws & Gonzalez
2001; Gonzalez 1998).

3.2. 16 Cygni

A linear ﬁt was performed with orthogonal distance regres-
sion (ODS) using the individual abundance errors for each
element, excluding K due to its uncertain non-LTE eﬀects.
It was necessary to assume a minimum threshold for the
abundances uncertainties because some species were return-
ing very small error bars (0.001 dex), heavily impacting the
abundance vs.
condensation temperature slope, because
some species does not have many lines. In order to address
this issue, we adopt a minimum abundance error of 0.009
dex, which is the average error of all species analyzed.

We obtain the slopes 3.99±0.58×10−5 dex K−1 and 2.78±
0.57 × 10−5 dex K−1 for 16 Cyg A − Sun, and 16 Cyg B −
Sun, vs condensation temperature, respectively. In contrast

Fig. 2. Elemental abundances of 16 Cyg A (upper panel) and
B (lower panel) based on our manually measured solar abun-
dances as a function of condensation temperature for light ele-
ments (Z≤ 30). Solid lines represent the linear ﬁts with a slope
of 3.99 ± 0.58 × 10−5 for the A component and 2.78 ± 0.57 × 10−5
for 16 Cyg B. Red triangles correspond to the molecule-based
abundances of C, N, and O.

to our past work (Tucci Maia et al. 2014), we do not break
the linear ﬁt into two distinct curves for the volatiles and
refractory elements, as a simple linear ﬁt represents well the
trend with Tc. We include nitrogen from NH, and for the
abundances of C and O we assumed the average between
the molecular and atomic abundances.

In Figure 3 we plot the abundances of the heavy ele-
ments (Z > 30). In this case, the abundances do not clearly
follow the same trend as in the previous case, with slopes
−0.16 ± 3.99 × 10−5 dex K−1 and −0.05 ± 2.97 × 10−5 dex
K−1 for 16 Cyg A − Sun and 16 Cyg B − Sun, repectively,
with a minimum uncertanty threshold of 0.02 dex in both
cases. However, due to the large errors in the [X/H] and
the small range in Tc it is not possible to claim if there
is indeed a trend by considering only the heavy elements,
but we stress that, within the uncertainties, the slope is
not actually diﬀerent from those of Z ≤ 30. Although no
Tc trend is detected, there is a diﬀerence ∆(A-B) = 0.043
± 0.075 dex regarding the abundances of these heavy ele-
ments, that somewhat follow the diﬀerence of Fe between
the stars of the pair, however, due to the high uncertainty
we cannot conclude if this discrepancy is real.

The abundances of 16 Cyg A relative to 16 Cyg B were
also determined and are presented in Figure 4. There is
an evident trend between the (A-B) abundances and Tc.
The slope of the linear ﬁt (without including the n-capture
elements) is 1.56 ± 0.24 × 10−5 dex K−1 (with a threshold
of 0.005 dex). This result agrees with Tucci Maia et al.
(2014; slope = 1.88 ± 0.79 × 10−5 dex K−1) within error
bars, showing once again the consistency and robustness of
our analysis. If we include the heavy elements on the ﬁt, we
ﬁnd a slope of 1.38 ± 0.41 × 10−5 (with a threshold of 0.010
dex). Although the abundance of potassium presented in
Table 3 has been corrected for non-LTE eﬀects using the
grid by Takeda et al. (2002), we did not use it for the linear
ﬁt as the non-LTE grid is too sparse for a precise correction.
Our slope is also in good agreement with the recent result
by Nissen et al. (2017), +0.98 ± 0.35 × 10−5 dex K−1, , based
on high-resolution high-S/N HARPS-N spectra.

3.3. Automated codes

We conducted tests utilizing iSpec version 2016 (Blanco-
Cuaresma et al. 2014) and ARES v2 (Sousa et al. 2015)
to automatically measure the EWs of 16 Cyg A, B and
the Sun, in order to diﬀerentially determine the stellar pa-
rameters. The aim of these tests is to evaluate if these
codes, when applied to high-resolution data and following
our methodology (same as in Section 2.2), could return a
similar result to what we ﬁnd by ”hand”. Our motivations
for this is to assess if our procedure could be automatized
and applied to a bigger sample of stars and still retrieve
stellar parameters with the same precision as ours, and to
also ﬁnd out if the chemical composition diﬀerences that
we found between the 16 Cygni components is consistent
by applying diﬀerent methods of EW meassurement.

As discussed earlier, the diﬀerential method minimize
most of the error sources while, for a solar twin sample, the
uncertainty is almost entirely related to the EW. One big
concern in a diﬀerential analysis is the continuum normal-
ization to achieve a consistent continuum placement for all
stars being analyzed. In this test, the spectra is the same
as our manual analysis, which was previously normalized,
and the EW measured following the same line list as ours.
In this way, any discrepancy in the values would be due
to how each code interprets and places the continuum, and
how the ﬁt is performed.

In addition to that, we use another set of spectra with
lower resolving power (R ∼ 81 000, from Tucci Maia et al.
(2014)), in order to evaluate if by using the same tools but
providing diﬀerent resolution spectra, the results could be
somewhat discrepant. In Table 4 we present the determined
stellar parameters obtained using the EW measurements
obtained with the automated codes. Comparing the results,
we ﬁnd that all the codes return stellar parameters in good
agreement to ours, based on the ”manual” measurements.
In overall, as we go to lower resolution, the uncertainty
gets higher, as expected, because it can lead to more blends
around the lines measured and thus a more contaminated
value for the EW, a phenomenon that also happens with
manual measurements as well, as we can see from the stellar
parameters from our previous work (Tucci Maia et al. 2014).
We also used iSpec and ARES to determine the elemen-
tal abundance of our sample for the elements with Z ≤ 30,
with the same method and spectra described in the previ-

presented in Table 5 with its respective abundance thresh-
olds. In both resolution sets iSpec and ARES returns a Tc
slope that is in agreement with our value within error bars.
The codes conﬁrm not only that 16 Cyg A is more metal
rich than B, but also the existence of Tc trend even though
we use spectra with almost half the resolving power (but
still high-resolution spectra) as the other. However, iSpec
shows a higher signiﬁcance on its values.

3.4. Li and Be

Lithium and beryllium abundances were determined by per-
forming spectral synthesis calculations, using a method sim-
ilar to the outlined in Tucci Maia et al. (2015). For lithium,
we used the Li-7 doublet at 670.7 nm and, for beryllium,
we used the doublet resonance lines of Be II at 313.0420 nm
and 313.1065 nm. The line list for the Li synthesis is from
Mel´endez et al. (2012), while for Be we used a modiﬁed list
of Ashwell et al. (2005), as described in Tucci Maia et al.
(2015).

For the spectral synthesis, we used the synth driver of
the 2014 version of the 1D LTE code MOOG (Sneden 1973).
We adopted A(Be) = 1.38 dex as the standard solar Be
abundance from Asplund et al. (2009). The model atmo-
spheres were interpolated from the MARCS grid (Gustafs-
son et al. 2008) using the stellar parameters previously ob-
tained. The abundances of Li were corrected for non-LTE
eﬀects using the online grids of the INSPECT project5.
Beryllium lines are insensitive to non-LTE eﬀects in the
solar type stars, according to Asplund (2005).

To determine the macroturbulence line broadening, we
ﬁrst analyzed the line proﬁles of the Fe I 602.7050 nm,
609.3644 nm, 615.1618 nm, 616.5360 nm, 670.5102 nm and
Ni I 676.7772 lines in the Sun; the synthesis also included

a rotational broadening of v sin i = 1.9 km.s−1 (Bruning
1984) and the instrumental broadening. The macroturbu-
lent velocity found for the Sun is Vmacro = 3.6 km s−1.
For 16 Cygni, we estimate the macroturbulence following
the relation of dos Santos et al. (2016), which takes into
account the dependence with eﬀective temperature and log
g.

With the macroturbulence ﬁxed, v sin i was estimated
for 16 Cyg A and B by ﬁtting the proﬁles of the six lines
mentioned above, also including the instrumental broaden-
ing. Table 6 shows the abundances of Li and Be with their
estimated macroturbulence and v sin i.

In Figure 5 we show the synthetic spectra of 16 Cyg A

and B plotted against the observed spectra.

Comparing our results with previous works in the lit-
erature, we found that Li and Be on the binary system 16
Cygni is hardly a consensus, but for lithium there is a quali-
tative agreement in the A component being more abundant
in lithium than the B component. What is important to
highlight here is that we found a higher Be abundance on
the A component when compared to B, in contrast to the
results of Deliyannis et al. (2000) and Garcia Lopez & Perez
de Taoro (1998), while Takeda et al. (2011) does not ﬁnd
any signiﬁcant Be variation between components, maybe
because of the diﬀerent parameters (including broadening
parameters) and diﬀerent spectra (resolving power, S/N,
normalization).

Sequence (∼ 0.04 dex in a time span of 8 Gyrs). Thus, in
a probable scenario of a planet being engulfed by its host
star, if this event happens after the stabilization of its con-
vective zone, one could expect an enhancement of Li and
Be, in a similar way as for refractory elements.

If we analyze our result with this hypothesis in mind,
the overabundance of lithium and beryllium on 16 Cyg A
relative to B (in addition to the enhancement of refrac-
tory elements) could indicate an accretion of mass. In fact,
Sandquist et al. (2002) suggests that the Li abundance can
be used as a signal of pollution enrichment of the outer
layers of solar-type stars, if stellar ages are well known.

The majority of previous studies agree that both com-
ponents of the binary system have the same stellar ages.
However, as seen in Table 7, we found that 16 Cyg A is
0.70 dex more rich in Li than 16 Cyg B, in accord with
the results of Takeda et al. (2011); King et al. (1997); Gon-
zalez (1998), and Ram´ırez et al. (2011). Furthermore, on
the lithium-age trend of Carlos et al. (2016) and Monroe
et al. (2013), 16 Cyg B shows a normal Li abundance for a
solar twin of its age, while 16 Cyg A has a Li abundance
above the curve, thus, when compared to a sample of solar
twins, the A component shows an anomalous abundance
of lithium. On top of that, 16 Cyg A also seems to have
a higher v sin i velocity (Table 6), which may indicate mo-
mentum transferred by mass accretion.

Gonzalez (1998) also suggests that the odd lithium
abundance of 16 Cyg A may be due to planet accretion of a
1-2 Jupiter mass planet. This would increase the abundance
not only of Li but of Fe as well. This is reinforced by Mazeh
et al. (1997) who propose that the separation between the
two stars (semi-major axis of 755 AU; Pl´avalov´a & Solovaya
2013) is suﬃciently small to permit planet-planet interac-
tions to cause orbit instabilities on the binary pair. Further-
more, the high eccentricity (0.689; Wittenmyer et al. 2007)
of 16 Cyg Bb could also be evidence of the interaction be-
tween the stars. Similar results were found by Laws & Gon-
zalez (2001), who ﬁnd a diﬀerence of 0.025 ± 0.009 dex in
[Fe/H] between the 16 Cygni pair (the A component being
more metal rich), suggesting a self-pollution scenario. Grat-
ton et al. (2001) also investigated abundance diﬀerences in
six main-sequence binaries with separations on the order of
hundreds AU (enough to permit orbit instabilities on pos-
sible exoplanets) with components with almost the same
mass, using the diﬀerential abundance technique (errors of
the order of 0.01 dex). Four of these systems did not show
any chemical diﬀerences between components, while the two
remaining binary systems (HD 219542 and HD 200466) dis-

4. Discussion

Lithium and beryllium are elements that are destroyed at
diﬀerent temperatures (2.5 × 106 K and 3.5 × 106 K, re-
spectively) and therefore at diﬀerent depths in the stellar
interiors. According to standard stellar evolution models,
these temperatures are only achieved below the base of the
convective zone. However, the solar photospheric Li abun-
dance is approximately 150 times lower than the meteoritic
value, indicating that extra mixing processes are acting in
solar-type stars and need to be taken into account.

In solar-type stars, it is known that Li has a strong cor-
relation with age and surface rotation (Beck et al. 2017;
Carlos et al. 2016; Baumann et al. 2010; Do Nascimento
et al. 2009), which suggests internal depletion of lithium.
However, it is a more challenging task to do the same anal-
ysis for Be due to diﬃculties related to its detection utilizing
instruments from the ground, with only two accessible lines
of Be II being near the atmospheric cutoﬀ in the UV, at 313
nm, in a heavily populated region of the spectrum. In Tucci
Maia et al. (2015), we determined the abundance of Be in
a sample of 8 solar twins through a “diﬀerential” spectral
synthesis, where the line list was calibrated to match the
observed solar spectrum, which was observed with the same
setup as the other stars. We found that the Be content of
solar twins is barely depleted, if at all, during the Main

play a clear metallicity diﬀerence, being the primary stars
more rich in iron (and in the most analyzed elements) than
the secondary. The authors also support the idea that the
diﬀerence in chemical composition of those binary stars is
due to infall of rocky material.

By taking into account the hypothesis of planet accre-
tion pollution, one could expect that the Be abundance
would also be enriched on the outer layers of the star, in a
similar way as Li. As discussed earlier, according to Tucci
Maia et al. (2015) beryllium is not depleted in a very eﬀec-
tive way (if it is at all) on solar twins stars during the Main
Sequence, making it also a good proxy for planet accretion
after the stabilization of the convective zone. Comparing
the pair of stars, we found that 16 Cyg A has 0.07 ± 0.03
dex more beryllium than 16 Cyg B, in line with the planet
engulfment hypothesis.

Following the procedure outlined in Galarza et al.
(2016), we estimate that, if we add 2.5 - 3.0 earth masses
of Earth-like material into the convective zone of 16 Cyg B,
we would alter the content of Be in about 0.07 dex, thus
canceling the abundance diﬀerence between the stars. This
estimate is close to the one derived by Tucci Maia et al.
(2014), who derived that the addition of 1.5 earth mass of
a material with a mixture of the composition of the Earth
and CM chondrites is necessary to reproduce the refractory
elements abundances as function of the condensation tem-
perature pattern on 16 Cyg B. However, Tucci Maia et al.
(2014) assumed that this abundance pattern is a spectral
signature of the 16 Cyg Bb rocky core formation and, now
considering also the abundances of Li and Be, it may be a
signature of planet accretion rather than planet formation.
In contrast, Th´eado & Vauclair (2012) discuss that en-
gulfment of rocky planets can induce instabilities on a stel-
lar surface, by the dilution of a metal-rich material in young
Main Sequence stars, which creates an unstable µ-gradient
at the bottom of the convective zone, activating ﬁngering
(thermohaline) convection. This would be responsible for
the depletion of the abundances that enriched the convec-
tive zone, thus quenching any signature of accretion. How-
ever, the authors also discuss that the mixing process would
not completely erase the enhanced abundances, meaning
that the engulfment event would still be detected in the
high precision abundances domain. In this scenario, Deal et
al. (2015) argues that, during the early periods on the Main
Sequence, 16 Cyg B was able to accrete rocky material from
its planetary disk, whereas no accretion may have developed
around 16 Cyg A due to the presence of a red dwarf (16 Cyg
C) orbiting at 73 AU around the A component (Turner et
al. 2001; Patience et al. 2002). The models of Deal et al.
(2015), that take into account the mixing by ﬁngering con-
vection, could reproduce the observed diﬀerence of lithium
on the binary pair by adding 0.66 Earth mass to 16 Cyg
B. However, in those same models, Be does not show any
depletion with the addition of 0.66 Earth mass, with the de-
struction starting to be more eﬀective with the accretion of
higher masses. Notice that among the two dozen chemical
elements showing abundance diﬀerences between 16 Cyg A
and B, the model of Deal et al. (2015) can only explain the
diﬀerence in lithium.

We ﬁnd this scenario very unlikely because the lithium
content of 16 Cyg B seems to be normal for its age when
compared to other solar twins, while 16 Cyg A, on the other
hand, is the one that displays an enhanced Li content for a

solar twin with ∼ 7 Gyr (Carlos et al. 2016; Monroe et al.
2013).

Another explanation for the discrepancy in Li abun-
dances could be diﬀerent initial rotation rates (Cochram &
Hatzes 1997). However, notice that although young solar-
type stars of a given mass may have diﬀerent rotation rates
(Lorenzo-Oliveira et al. 2019), they all seem to converge to
the same rotation period at an age of about 0.2 Gyr (Barnes
2003), which is much earlier than the age of 16 Cyg. Fur-
thermore, the companion 16 Cyg C at 73 AU may be too
far as to have any signiﬁcant impact on 16 Cyg A.

5. Conclusions

We present a detailed study of elemental abundances on the
16 Cygni solar twin binary system using higher quality data
(R = 160 000, S/N = 1000 at 670nm). We conﬁrm the dif-
ference of 0.04 dex in [Fe/H] between 16 Cyg A and B. We
also conﬁrm the positive trend of diﬀerential abundances
(A - B) as a function of condensation temperature, in very
good agreement with our previous work (Tucci Maia et al.
2014), which was obtained with spectra of lower resolving
power and signal to noise ratio on a diﬀerent instrument.
There is also good agreement with the slope obtained inde-
pendently by Nissen et al. (2017), and also using a diﬀerent
spectrograph (HARPS-N). We also ﬁnd the same result by
employing the ARES and iSpec codes to measure the EWs.
This shows that our diﬀerential analysis method is consis-
tent and a powerful tool to unveil physical characteristics
that can only be seen with high precision abundance deter-
minations, and that the Tc trend is a physical phenomenon,
being thus unlikely to be related to some instrumental ef-
fect, as we show that high-quality spectra obtained with
diﬀerent spectrographs (Espadons at CFHT, HDS at Sub-
aru, HARPS-N at the Telescopio Nationale Galileo) give
essentially the same results (within error bars).

We also determine the abundance of Li and Be through
a “diﬀerential” spectral synthesis analysis, using the solar
spectrum (obtained with the same instrumental conﬁgura-
tion) to calibrate the line list that was used to perform the
calculations. We found that 16 Cyg A exhibits an over-
abundance of not only Li (as reported by previous studies)
but of Be as well, relative to 16 Cyg B. This discrepancy is
compatible with a 2.5 - 3.0 Earth masses of earth like mate-
rial if we assume a convective zone similar to Sun for both
stars. Interestingly, the amount of rocky material needed
to explain the Li and Be overabundances is also compatible
with the trend of the (A-B) abundances vs. condensation
temperature, reinforcing thus the hypothesis of planet en-
gulfment, although a similar opposite trend in (B-A) could
be attributed to the eﬀect of the rocky core in 16 Cyg B
(Tucci Maia et al. 2014). However, the overabundant Li
content in 16 Cyg A, above what is expected for its age,
suggest that the signature that we are observed is due to a
planet engulfment event.
