Abstract

Experimentally observed superdeformed (SD) rotational bands in 36Ar and 40Ar are studied

by the cranked shell model (CSM) with the paring correlations treated by a particle-number-

conserving (PNC) method. This is the ﬁrst time the PNC-CSM calculations are performed on the

light nuclear mass region around A = 40. The experimental kinematic moments of inertia J (1)

versus rotational frequency are reproduced well. The backbending of the SD band at frequency

around (cid:126)ω = 1.5 MeV in 36Ar is attributed to the sharp rise of the simultaneous alignments of

the neutron and proton 1d5/2[202]5/2 pairs and 1f7/2[321]3/2 pairs, which is the consequence of

the band crossing between the 1d5/2[202]5/2 and 1f7/2[321]3/2 conﬁguration states. The gentle

upbending at the low frequency of the SD band in 40Ar is mainly eﬀected by the alignments of

the neutron 1f7/2[321]3/2 pairs and proton 1d5/2[202]5/2 pairs. The PNC-CSM calculations show

that besides the diagonal parts, the oﬀ-diagonal parts of the alignments play an important role in

the rotational behavior of the SD bands.

INTRODUCTION

Since the ﬁrst observation of the superdeformed rotational band in 152Dy [1], numerous

superdeformed bands have been discovered in the ”traditional” superdeformed regions of

mass numbers 80, 130, 150 and 190. The latest superdeformed archipelago has been found

in the light mass region around A = 40. High spin states of the superdeformed rotational

bands have been successfully populated in experiment for 36Ar [2, 3], 40Ar [4], 40Ca[5] and

44Ti[6]. Most interestingly, these nuclei are magic or near-magic systems, whose ground

states are corresponding to a spherical shape. This exotic shape coexistence phenomenon

provides an ideal test ground of theoretical models.

Many microscopic descriptions of these bands have been performed, like Cranked Nilsson-

Strutinsky (CNS) [2], Shell Model (SM) [2, 7–9], Cranked Relativistic Mean-Field (CRMF) [5],

Hartree-Fock BCS with Skyrme interaction SLy6 [10], Angular Momentum Projected Gener-

ator Coordinate (AMP-GCM) method with the Gogny force D1S [11], Projected Shell Model

(PSM) [12, 13], Multidimensionally Constrained Relativistic Mean Field (MDC-RMF) [14],

Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics (AMD) [15–18], Cluster models [19] and Cranked

Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (CHFB) etc. Each of these models can give a good description

of the certain aspects of these superdeformed nuclei under certain assumptions. Therefore,

comprehensive understanding of the superdeformed nuclear structure of these magic or

near magic nuclei needs a complementary investigations of diﬀerent models. Among these

models, as it states in Refs. [8, 9], the interacting shell model, when aﬀordable, is a prime

choice. However, to carry out a practical shell model calculations of 36Ar, the 1d5/2 orbital

had to be excluded from the sd-pf shells space [2]. Recently, shell model calculations were

performed on 46Ti where a limited conﬁguration space consisting of 1d3/2 and 1f7/2 orbitals

is constructed. But the full sd-pf calculations are still not possible [20]. Therefore, as the

full sd-pf shell model calculations are diﬃcult in the A = 40 mass region so far, to test an

eﬃcient shell model truncation scheme for the well-deformed nuclei in light mass region is

necessary.

Cranked shell model has been proved to be a powerful tool to study the nuclear collective

rotation of the most of areas in the nuclear chart. However, up to now, there is no cranked

shell model calculation being performed on the SD bands around A = 40 region. For the

ﬁrst time, we perform the cranked shell model calculations with the pairing treated by the

2

particle-number conserving (PNC-CSM) method on the SD bands in such a light nuclear

mass region. The PNC-CSM method is proposed to treat properly the pairing correlations

and blocking eﬀects. It has been applied successfully for describing the properties of normal

deformed nuclei in A∼170 mass region [21–26], superdeformed nuclei in A∼150, 190 mass

region [27–31], high-K isomeric states in the rare-earth and actinide mass region [32–35]

and recently in the heaviest actinides and light superheavy nuclei around Z∼100 region [36–

38]. In contrast to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer (BCS) or Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov (HFB)

approach, the Hamiltonian is diagonalized directly in a truncated Fock space in the PNC

method [39, 40]. Therefore, particle number is conserved and Pauli blocking eﬀects are taken

into account exactly.

In the present work we focus on the case of 36Ar and its heavier isotope 40Ar, of which

superdeformed rotational bands have been established up to the high spin. The present PNC-

CSM calculations can reproduce the experimental extracted moment of inertia within an

acceptable deviation. This indicates that the PNC-CSM method is an appropriate approach

in the light mass region around A = 40. The observed backbendings of the rotational bands

can be understand in the PNC-CSM frame work as the band crossing between the [321]3/2

and [202]5/2 conﬁguration bands (for both of the neutron and proton). Note that the Nilsson

[321]3/2 and [202]5/2 levels stem from the spherical 1f7/2 and 1d5/2 orbitals, respectively.

Therefore the eﬀect of the 1d5/2 orbital is nontrivial on these rotational SD bands.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

The cranked shell model Hamiltonian of an axially symmetric nucleus in the rotating

frame reads,

HCSM =

(cid:88)

n

(hNil − ωjx)n + HP,

(1)

where h0(ω) = hNil − ωjx is the single-particle part with hNil being the Nilsson Hamilto-

nian [41, 42] and −ωjx being the Coriolis force with the cranking frequency ω about the x

axis. The cranked Nilsson orbitals are obtained by diagonalizing the single-particle Hamil-

tonian h0(ω) = hNil − ωjx. HP = HP(0) + HP(2) is the pairing including monopole and

quadrupole pairing correlations. The corresponding eﬀective pairing strengths G0 and G2

are connected with the dimension of the truncated Cranked Many-Particle Conﬁguration

(CMPC) space[43] in which HCSM is diagonalized. In the following calculations, the CMPC

3

space for 36,40Ar is constructed in the N = 0 ∼ 4 major shells for both of neutrons and pro-

tons. By taking the cranked many-particle conﬁguration truncation (Fock space truncation),

the dimensions of the CMPC space are about 500, the corresponding eﬀective monopole and

quadrupole pairing strengths are G0p = G0n = 0.18 MeV and G2p = G2n = 0.08 MeV,

respectively. The yrast and low-lying eigenstates are obtained as,

|ψ(cid:105) =

(cid:88)

i

Ci |i(cid:105) ,

(2)

where |i(cid:105) is a cranked many-particle conﬁguration and Ci is the corresponding probability

amplitude.

The angular momentum alignment (cid:104)Jx(cid:105) of the state |ψ(cid:105) is,

(cid:104)ψ| Jx |ψ(cid:105) =

(cid:88)

i

|Ci|2 (cid:104)i| Jx |i(cid:105) + 2

(cid:88)

i<j

C ∗

i Cj (cid:104)i| Jx |j(cid:105) .

(3)

Since Jx is an one-body operator, the matrix element (cid:104)i| Jx |j(cid:105) is nonzero only when |i(cid:105)

and |j(cid:105) diﬀer by one particle occupation, which are denoted by orbitals µ and ν. Then

|i(cid:105) = (−)Miµ |µ · · · (cid:105) and |j(cid:105) = (−)Mjν |ν · · · (cid:105) with the ellipsis stands for the same particle

occupation and (−)Miµ = ±1 and (−)Mjν = ±1 according to whether the permutation is

even or odd. The angular momentum alignment can be expressed as the diagonal and the

oﬀ-diagonal parts,

(cid:104)Jx(cid:105) = (cid:104)Jx(µ)(cid:105) + (cid:104)Jx(µν)(cid:105)

(cid:88)

=

jx(µ) +

µ

(cid:88)

µ<ν

jx(µν).

(4)

The kinematic moment of inertia is given by J (1) = (cid:104)ψ| Jx |ψ(cid:105) /ω. For the details of the

PNC-CSM method, see Refs. [21, 39, 40].

III. CALCULATION AND DISCUSSION

The Nilsson parameters (κ, µ) are taken from Ref. [44]. Since 36Ar is a N = Z symmetric

nuclear system and the density of the single-particle level is low, the same set of (κ, µ) is

used for neutrons and protons in the present calculations. The values of κ2, κ3 are modiﬁed

slightly to reproduce the correct single-particle level sequence. The corresponding Nilsson

diagram for protons or neutrons is shown in Figure 1. As it shows that the deformed

ε2 (ε4 = 0 and ε6 = 0.). The Nilsson parameters (κ, µ) are taken from Ref. [44]. The κ2, κ3 are

modiﬁed slightly as κ2 = 0.08, κ3 = 0.12.

N = Z = 18 and 20 energy gaps appear at the well-deformed prolate region around ε2 = 0.4

and 0.5, respectively. At the oblate deformation side, the N = Z = 20 energy gap around

ε2 = −0.4 is as large as the spherical shell gap at N = Z = 20.

The quadrupole deformation β2 = 0.45 was suggested by cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky

calculations for the SD bands of 36Ar in the original experimental paper [2]. Later, a large low

spin quadrupole deformation β2 = 0.46 ± 0.03 is deduced from the B(E2) value for 4+ → 2+
SD transition in Ref. [3]. As for 40Ar, the observed superdeformed structure was calculated

by cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov with the P + QQ force [4]. The calculation shows that
β2 = 0.57 at I = 0(cid:126) and the deformation gradually decreases to 0.45 at I = 12(cid:126). Triaxiality is
found to be almost zero (γ ≈ 0◦) throughout this angular momentum range. Calculations by

the parity and angular momentum projection and the generator coordinate method suggest

a quadrupole deformation β2 = 0.478 and triaxial deformation with γ ≈ 10◦ [18]. In the

PNC-CSM frame, nucleus is restricted to an axial symmetric shape in the whole spin range

with the ﬁxed deformation parameters. ε2 = 0.48 and ε2 = 0.5 are adopted for 36Ar and
40Ar, respectively. Higher order axial symmetric deformations of ε4 = 0.06 and ε6 = −0.06
are included to reproduce the backbending of the SD band in 36Ar.

With the above selected parameters, the cranked Nilsson levels with quadrupole defor-

mation parameter ε2 = 0.48 for 36Ar are calculated in ﬁgure 2. It is same for neutrons and

protons. The proton/neutron Fermi surface of 36Ar locates between the 1f7/2[321]3/2 and

1d5/2[202]5/2 orbitals. Since these two Nilsson orbitals stay close to each other and cross
around (cid:126)ω = 1.5 MeV (α = −1/2), a band crossing is likely to arise around (cid:126)ω = 1.5

MeV. In contrast, the neutron Fermi surface of 40Ar is lifted up to the deformed shell gap at

N = 22 where the band crossing occurs between the 1d3/2[200]1/2 and 1g9/2[440]1/2 orbitals
around (cid:126)ω = 1.5 MeV. Since 1g9/2[440]1/2 orbital is a high−j low−ω intruder orbital, which

is characterized by its large contributions to alignment and large Coriolis responses, a sharp
backbending would arise around (cid:126)ω = 1.5 MeV. However, the experimentally observed SD
band in 40Ar is up to spin I π = 12+ which is equivalent to (cid:126)ω = 1.35 MeV. Then the

predicted band crossing would occur beyond the experimental observed frequency range.

Therefore, we will not discuss about it.

The comparison of the theoretical J (1) with the extracted experimental values for SD

bands in 36,40Ar is plotted in Figure 3. The near-perfect rotational behavior of the 36Ar was

observed in experiment up to spin I = 10(cid:126) (around rotational frequency (cid:126)ω = 1.5 MeV)
where a backbending arises [2]. The agreement of the backbending frequency around (cid:126)ω =
1.5 MeV is remarkably good. The calculated backbending of J (1) at (cid:126)ω > 1.5 MeV is less

pronounced than the experimental data. The Cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky calculation shows

the system maintains an axially symmetric shape before the backbending while it changes

the shape to have the triaxial deformation after the backbending [3]. The cranked Skyrme-

Hartree-Fock calculation reveals that the shape of the superdeformed 36Ar system becomes

triaxial and evolves toward the oblate shape at high spin limit. The PNC-CSM calculation is

carried out with the ﬁxed symmetric deformations throughout the whole observed frequency

range. To develop present model to take into account the shape evolution may improve

quantitive agreement between theoretical results and experimental data.

To reveal the microscopic mechanism of the backbending of the rotational band is often

interested in theoretical studies since it can provide valuable informations to understand

deeply the microscopic structures of the rotating nuclear system. Based on the analysis of

projected shell model calculation, the backbending of the SD band in 36Ar is explained as

the results of the 0-, 2-, and 4-quasiparticle (qp) bands cross each other at the same angular

momentum I + = 10+ [12].

In the PNC-CSM calculations, the band crossing in 36Ar is clearly exhibited by the

occupation probabilities nµ of each cranked Nilsson orbit µ in ﬁgure 4(a) and 4(c). We

can see that nµ of neurons and protons are the same. Before the backbending (at (cid:126)ω ≤

1.5 MeV), 1f7/2[321]3/2, orbital just above the Fermi surface, is almost empty (nµ ≈ 0)

and 1d5/2[202]5/2, orbital just below the Fermi surface, is almost fully occupied (nµ ≈ 2)

whereas it exchanges after the backbending. Therefore, the backbending results from the

simultaneous band crossing of neutrons and protons between the ground state (0-qp) band

and the 1f7/2[321]3/2 (with signature α = ±1/2) conﬁguration state (4-qp) band. This is

consistent with the conclusion of projected shell model calculations. Furthermore, the PNC-

CSM calculations present clearly why in contrast to the common band crossing picture, the

2-qp conﬁgurations do not have a chance to play a major role in the structure of the SD yrast

band in 36Ar. Since 36Ar is a N = Z symmetric nucleus, the neutron and proton signature

pairs are excited from 1d5/2[202]5/2 to 1f7/2[321]3/2 conﬁguration state simultaneously to

form a 4-qp state immediately after the backbending.

To quantify the eﬀect, more detailed informations of the angular momentum alignment

ν are presented in ﬁgure 5. As it shows in ﬁgure 5 (a) and 5 (c), the sharp rise of the J (1) in

36Ar mainly results from the contribution of the sudden increased simultaneous alignments
of neutron and proton 1d5/2[202]5/2 pairs and 1f7/2[321]3/2 pairs at (cid:126)ω = 1.5 MeV. Besides,

their involved interference terms are important too. While (cid:104)Jx([321]1/2⊗[321]3/2)(cid:105) decreases
suddenly at (cid:126)ω = 1.5 MeV, (cid:104)Jx([330]1/2⊗[321]3/2)(cid:105) shows an excessive sharp increase. The
smooth ascend of the J (1) at the low frequency is attributed to the gradual alignments of

neutron and proton 1f7/2[330]1/2] pairs and 1d5/2[220]1/2 pairs.

The rotational behavior of the SD band in 40Ar is quite diﬀerent. Only a slight upbending
of J (1) appears at the low spin (around (cid:126)ω = 0.5 MeV). Then J (1) increases smoothly

with rotational frequency. The PNC-CSM calculations reproduce the experimental variation

tendency very well. However, the theoretical results underestimate the data by about 1.2
(cid:126)2MeV−1 throughout the whole observed frequency range. The n − p pairing would be

important in such (near-)symmetric nuclear system, that is not included in the present

PNC-CSM method. This could be one of the reasons for the systematic shift down of the

9

theoretical results. Nevertheless, further investigations aimed at the eﬀect of the n − p

pairing should be fulﬁlled by the PNC-CSM method in this mass region.

Eﬀected by the four additional neutrons in 40Ar, the rotational behavior diﬀers a lot

with that of 36Ar. From the occupation probabilities in ﬁgure 4 (b), we can see that the

1d3/2[200]1/2 and 1f7/2[321]3/2 orbitals are fully occupied (nµ ≈ 2). Since the deformed

N = 22 shell gap is comparatively big, there is no neutron band crossing occurring during the

experimentally observed frequency range. The proton occupation probabilities [see ﬁgure 4

(d)] are eﬀected accordingly due to the change of the mean ﬁeld. 1d5/2[202]5/2 orbital is

more than half occupied (nµ ≈ 1.25), and 1f7/2[321]3/2 orbital is less than half occupied

(nµ ≈ 0.75). From ﬁgure 5 (b) and 5 (d), the slight upbending at the low frequency is

attributed to the alignments of the neutron 1f7/2[321]3/2 pairs and proton 1d5/2[202]5/2

pairs, and their involved interference terms of neutron (cid:104)Jx([312]5/2 ⊗ [321]3/2)(cid:105) and proton

(cid:104)Jx([330]1/2 ⊗ [321]3/2)(cid:105).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

For the ﬁrst time the cranked shell model with the paring correlations treated by the

particle-number-conserving method has been used to describe the superdeformed rotational

bands in the A = 40 mass region. The calculations are carried out within N = 0 ∼ 4 major

shells, with axially symmetric deformation parameters ε2,4,6 being included and the pairing

correlations being treated properly. The experimental kinematic moments of inertia J (1)

versus rotational frequency in 36Ar and 40Ar are reproduced well. This may convince us

that the PNC-CSM method is an eﬃcient method to describe the rotational properties of

the superdeformed nuclei around the A = 40 mass region.

The microscopic mechanism of the variation of the superdeformed bands versus frequency
is explicit in the PNC-CSM calculations. The backbending around (cid:126)ω = 1.5 MeV of the

SD band in 36Ar is clearly presented by analysis the dominant components of the total

wave function of the cranked shell model Hamiltonian. It is attributed to the simultaneous

alignments of neutron and proton 1d5/2[202]5/2 pairs and 1f7/2[321]3/2 pairs, which is caused

by the band crossing between the 1d5/2[202]5/2 and 1f7/2[321]3/2 conﬁguration states. As

for 40Ar, four more additional neutrons rise the neutron Fermi surface to the N = 22

deformed shell gap. There is no band crossing occurring during the experimentally observed

10

frequency range. Therefore the variation of the J (1) versus frequency is much gentle. The

slight upbending at the low frequency is mainly eﬀected by the alignments of the neutron

1f7/2[321]3/2 pairs and proton 1d5/2[202]5/2 pairs. Moreover, the PNC-CSM results show

that besides the diagonal parts, the oﬀ-diagonal parts is very important. We see that not

only 1f7/2 orbital, but also 1d5/2 plays a very important role in the rotational behavior of

the SD bands in 36,40Ar, which can not be neglected.
