Abstract 

This paper compares the in-sample and out-of-sample performance of several models for 

computing the tail risk of one-month and one-year electricity futures contracts traded in the 

NordPool, French, German, and Spanish markets in 2008-2017. As measures of tail risk, we 

use the one-day-ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES). With VaR, the 

AR (1)-GARCH (1,1) model with Student-t distribution is the best-performing specification 

with 88% cases in which the Fisher test accepts the model, with a success rate of 94% in the 

left tail and of 81% in the right tail. The model passes the test of model adequacy in the 

100% of the cases in the NordPool and German markets, but only in the 88% and 63% of 

the cases in the Spanish and French markets. With ES, this model passes the test of model 

adequacy in 100% of cases in all markets. Historical Simulation and Quantile Regression-

based approaches misestimate tail risks. The right-hand tail of the returns is more difficult 

to model than the left-hand tail and therefore financial regulators and the administrators of 

futures  markets  should  take  these  results  into  account  when  setting  additional  regulatory 

capital requirements and margin account regulations to short positions.

1.  Introduction  

The  liberalization  of  electricity  markets  generates  competition  coupled  with  price 

uncertainty. Both factors create powerful incentives to carry out effective management of 

the market risk of electricity prices.  Consider a portfolio of an energy trading company. If 

it  trades  in  gas  and  power,  it  may  have  positions  in  many  locations.  Each  location  is 

characterized by its forward price and volatility curves. Thus, the firm may face hundreds of 

portfolio value drivers1. Given this high dimensionality, mapping the changes in portfolio 

value on a reduced set of principal risk factors is common practice in the industry, Eydeland, 

and Wolyniec (2003). Electricity futures contracts prices are key risk factors and we need 

thus methods for representing their distribution for the computation of tail risk measures of 

complex portfolios using Monte Carlo simulation or delta-gamma approaches.  

The right  assessment of  the tail  risk of the price  of electricity futures contracts  is  crucial 

when setting the size of the buffer designed to protect the futures market’s clearinghouse 

from losses caused by defaults in traders’ positions. Most futures markets erect at least two 

consecutive  safeguards.  First,  the  exchange’s  own  default  fund  and  second,  the 

clearinghouse members’ default fund. If, when setting the size of both default funds, they 

underestimate losses because of extreme movements in futures prices, the exchange and its 

members  may  face  significant  liquidity  (and  perhaps  solvency)  problems. A  recent  event 

illustrates this situation. On September 13, 2018, the Financial Times (2018), reported that 

in the Nasdaq’s Nordic futures power market the losses incurred by just one trader2 wiped 

out  all the exchange’s own default fund of €7 million  and an additional €107 million, or 

1 Eydeland and Wolyniec (2003) suggest that in the US the firm may face several thousand possible value 
drivers. 
2 The  trader,  an  individual  member  of  the  Nasdaq  Clearing  firm,  could  clear  his  own  trades  without  going 
through a bank. He based his strategy on betting on a narrowing of the price differential between German and 
Norpool  electricity  prices.  When  implementing  this  strategy,  he  likely  bought  Norpool  futures  and  sold 
Germany’s EEX futures. German prices augmented because of increases in carbon prices and, at the same time, 
Nordic prices fell because of wetter than previously expected weather expanded the hydropower supply. Both 
legs  of  the  strategy  generated  huge  losses  simultaneously  and,  unable  to  meet  the  margin  calls,  the  trader 
declared bankruptcy.

64%, of the member’s default fund of €166 million. These losses prompted Nasdaq to ask 

the members of the clearinghouse to make compensating payments to the funds within 48 

hours.  

Although  research  exists  (Byström,  2005,  Westgaard  et  al.,  2019b)  about  what  method 

provides better forecasts of tail risk in day-ahead electricity prices, little is known about this 

issue with longer-maturity contract prices (monthly, quarterly and yearly). The scarcity of 

research  on  these  matters  implies  a  lack  of  convincing  evidence  on  how  well  alternative 

models measure the tail risk of the electricity futures price. In this paper, we aim to fill this 

gap in the literature, by comparing the in-sample and out-of-sample performance of several 

models  and  markets  and  suggesting  policy  recommendations,  based  on  the  empirical 

evidence provided.  

The  non-storability  of  electricity  and  the  physical  and  reliability  constraints  in  its 

transmission manifest itself in complex price distributions, as measured by time-dependent 

volatility,  skewness,  kurtosis,  and  quantiles.  Although  research  on  the  distributional 

characteristics  of  spot  and  day-ahead  electricity  prices  is  available  (e.g.  Escribano  et  al., 

2011), we know little about the tail risk of futures prices with maturities longer than one day 

and its implications for risk management.   In this paper, we compare the in-sample and out-

of-sample performance of several models for computing the tail  risk of electricity futures 

contracts with one month and one year to maturity traded in the NordPool, French, German 

and  Spanish  markets  in  2008-2017. As  measures  of  tail  risk,  we  use  Value-at-Risk  and 

Expected Shortfall. Our findings support the conclusion that the AR (1)-GARCH-t model 

performs better than other models in predicting VaR and ES in all markets. Overall, and with 

VaR, the AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model with Student-t distribution is the best model with 88% 

3 

 
 
 
cases in which their adequacy is accepted by the Fisher test, with a higher success rate in the 

left tail (94%) than in the right tail (81%). This model works better for monthly contracts 

than for yearly contracts and passes the test of model adequacy in the 100% of the cases in 

the NordPool, and German markets, and in 88% of the cases in the Spanish market, but only 

in the 63% of the cases when predicting VaR in the French market. We report persistent risk 

misestimation  in  widely  used  methods  in  the  industry,  such  as  Historical  Simulation  or 

methods that seem to work well in other energy markets, such as Quantile Regression. The 

right-hand tail of the returns is more difficult to model than the left-hand tail. 

This study makes several contributions to existing literature. First, while several studies (e.g. 

Byström, 2005, Chan and Grey, 2006) have addressed the performance of VaR forecasting 

models in electricity prices, few papers have focused on the estimation of extreme high and 

low quantiles for the prices of electricity futures contracts. With this paper, we aim to fill 

this  gap  in  the  literature. This  is  important  because  producers  and  retailers  of  electricity 

pursuing  active  risk  management  policies  use  futures  contracts  of  different  maturities 

(monthly, quarterly, yearly) when they become available (Sanda et al., 2013, Boroumand et 

al., 2015). In contrast with Gonzalez-Pedraz et al. (2014) who studied the tail risk of monthly 

futures  contracts  in  one  market  (NYMEX),  we  study  monthly  and  yearly  maturities  in 

several markets. Second, we model the tail risk both for long positions in futures contracts, 

typically  held  by  retailers  and  for  short  positions  in  a  futures  contract,  typically  held  by 

producers. Third,  earlier  studies  focused  on  the  NordPool  or  German  markets. We  study 

those markets, but we also include the French and Spanish markets, which have received 

limited attention in the literature so far. Fourth, we study an array of competing models, from 

the simple historical simulation to quantile regression. Fifth, we study the extent to which 

the model’s out-of-sample performance matches its in-sample fitting. Also, besides VaR, this 

4 

 
 
paper presents the forecast and backtesting of ES, which is becoming the tail risk measure 

of choice for regulators.  

We  organize  the  rest  of  this  paper  as  follows.  Section  2  reviews  the  literature.  After 

describing the methodology in Section 3, we present data in Section 4. Section 5 discusses 

the empirical results. Section 6 concludes.  

2.  Literature Review 

Literature  has  addressed  optimal  hedging  strategies  in  those  markets  using  financial 

contracts,  Deng  and  Oren  (2006).  Vehviläinen  and  Keppo  (2003)  studied  the  optimal 

hedging strategy of spot price risk by using futures contracts. Most papers investigating the 

tail risk of electricity prices focus on the spot or day-ahead price and study hourly prices or 

their daily averages. However, we cannot translate the results directly to the prices of futures 

contracts with longer maturities. Spot or day-ahead prices trade seven days a week and the 

average value and the volatility differ between hours and between weekdays and weekends. 

Also,  these  prices  present  strong  seasonality,  regime-switching,  large  price  spikes,  time-

varying daily volatility (Knittel and Roberts, 2005, Escribano et al., 2011, Paraschiv et al., 

2016), complex marginal distributions with significant skewness and excess kurtosis (Benth 

et al., 2008) and negative prices (Fanone et al., 2013). Futures prices trade five days a week 

and  are  always  non-negative,  the  seasonal  variation  is  less  salient,  price  spikes  are  less 

frequent and smaller, the average price increases with maturity and the volatility (Samuelson 

effect), skewness and kurtosis decrease with maturity (Blanco et al., 2018), but they may 

present regime-switching and non-Gaussian marginal distributions (Andresen et al., 2010). 

As Quinn, et al. (2005) argue, futures prices are a function of market expectations of demand 

and cost conditions during the delivery period. The current market situation (i.e. spot prices) 

5 

 
 
 
may or may not influence these expectations and as a result, the tail risk may be different for 

spot and futures prices. 

Most papers investigating the tail risk in electricity futures prices focus on day-ahead prices. 

Henney and Keers (1999) suggest the Historical Simulation (HS) in the case of established 

electricity  markets.  Leong  and  Siddiqi  (1999)  compute  the  VaR  of  electricity  spot  prices 

assuming  a  normal  distribution  for  electricity  prices.  Dahlgren  et  al.  (2003)  apply  the 

historical  simulation  method  to  the  computation  of  VaR  and  ES  of  day-ahead  electricity 

prices.   Byström (2005) studies hourly day-ahead Nord Pool prices using a GARCH-EVT 

framework and recommends the generalized Pareto distribution. Liu and Wu (2007) use the 

delta-normal method to calculate the value of VaR of day-ahead electricity prices. Keles et 

al. (2016) report similar results to Byström, (2005) in the case of the German market (EPEX). 

Chan and Grey (2006) analyze day-ahead prices from five markets using and EGARCH-

EVT specification that performs well in  forecasting out-of-sample VaR  in  comparison  to 

several models. Bunn et al. (2016) study UK day-ahead prices and conclude that a linear 

quantile regression model outperforms skewed GARCH-t and CAViaR models in out-of-

sample  forecasts  of  VaR.  Paraschiv  et  al.  (2014,  2016)  show  the  improvements  got  in 

forecasting the tail risk of day-ahead prices by using fundamental variables, and Hagfors et 

al. (2016a) using quantile regression techniques show that the sensitivities to fundamentals 

may  depend  on  market  conditions.  Hagfors  et  al.  (2016b)  analyze  extreme  positive  and 

negative price occurrences in the German day-ahead market by using non-linear methods. 

Westgaard et al. (2019b) present a detailed analysis of the performance of VaR forecasts of 

hourly day-ahead prices in the German market, using fundamental explanatory variables and 

six different models: QR, EWQR, EWDKQR, GARCH-T, SAV CAViaR and AS CAViaR. 

Although  the  best-performing  model  varies  across  trading  periods  and  depending  on  the 

6 

 
 
evaluation criteria, the authors recommend the EWQR based on selected fundamentals as 

the best model overall.  

With  futures  with  longer  maturities,  as  far  as  we  know,  the  evidence  on  the  relative 

performance  of  tail  risk  measures  is  scarce.  Gonzalez  Pedraz  et  al.  (2014)  analyze  PJM 

electricity  futures  with  monthly  maturity  (M1,  the  front  contract)  traded  in  the  NYMEX 

market in an energy portfolio analysis and report that the best VaR forecasting model is a 

GARCH model with a Student t distribution. Westgaard et  al. (2019a) investigate the in-

sample performance of estimates of one-day-ahead VaR got from three univariate models 

(EWMA, FHS, QR) of the prices of nine European energy futures front (M1) contracts, for 

oil, gas, coal, and M1, M2 and M3 contracts for electricity. They conclude that VaR forecasts 

made by the QR model present the best conditional and unconditional performance, followed 

by the FHS, whereas EWMA’s forecast is the poorest. Also, the modeling of the right-hand 

tail is more challenging in all cases, suggesting that the tail risk attributable to short positions 

is more difficult to assess. 

3.  Methodology 

This section presents the various approaches to calculating VaR(t) and ES(t) for quantile 

 and period t examined in this paper. These distribution-based risk measures are estimates 

of the capital reserve (as required by the regulator or set by the firm) as protection against 

fluctuations  in  the  value  of  a  financial  asset.  We  focus  on  one-step-ahead  estimates  of 

VaR(t) and ES(t) calculated with data up to period t -1 and based on daily returns for 

long ( =  )  and short ( =  ) positions.  Let  rj be  the asset return  series 

where j = t-1,…,1 . We define the left-hand side VaR(t) measuring the tail risk of long 

futures positions, as  

7 

 
 
 
Pr[𝑟(𝑡) < 𝑉𝑎𝑅(𝛼, 𝑡)] =  𝛼  ;  𝛼 < 0.5

(1) 

The right-hand side VaR(t) measuring the tail risk of short futures positions, is  

Pr[𝑟(𝑡) > 𝑉𝑎𝑅(𝛼, 𝑡)] =  1 − 𝛼  ;   𝛼 ≥ 0.5

(2) 

In the same way, we define the left-hand side ES(t) as 

𝐸𝑆(𝛼, 𝑡) = 𝐸[𝑟(𝑡)| 𝑟(𝑡) < 𝑉𝑎𝑅(𝛼, 𝑡)]  ;  𝛼 < 0.5

(3) 

And the right-hand side ES(t) as 

𝐸𝑆(𝛼, 𝑡) = 𝐸[𝑟(𝑡)| 𝑟(𝑡) > 𝑉𝑎𝑅(𝛼, 𝑡)]  ;   𝛼 ≥ 0.5

(4) 

Regarding the computation of ES(t), we apply two methods. First, if the model we use 

allows  a  closed-form  for  its  computation,  we  use  it.  Second,  if  there  is  no  closed-form 

available, we rely on the representation of ES as integrated VaR as presented in Acerbi and 

Tasche (2002) 

𝐸𝑆(𝛼, 𝑡) =

1
𝛼

𝛼

∫ 𝑉𝑎𝑅(𝑢)𝑑𝑢

and apply the discretization suggested in Emmer et al. (2015)

𝐸𝑆(𝛼, 𝑡) ≅

(𝑉𝑎𝑅(𝛼, 𝑡) + 𝑉𝑎𝑅(0.75𝛼 + 0.25𝐼(𝛼), 𝑡) + 𝑉𝑎𝑅(0.5𝛼 + 0.5𝐼(𝛼), 𝑡)

+ 𝑉𝑎𝑅(0.25𝛼 + 0.75𝐼(𝛼), 𝑡)         𝐼(𝛼) = {

1 𝛼 ≥ 0.5
0 𝛼 < 0.5

}                       (6) 

Intuitively (6) suggests that an estimate of ES could be considered reliable if estimates of 

the  four  VaR  are  reliable3.  Backtesting  ES  could  be  done  by  simultaneously  backtesting 

multiple VaR estimates at different levels. 

As  methods  for  the  computation  of  those  risk  measures,  we  apply  two  non-parametric 

models. First, we consider the Historical Simulation (HS) method because of Perignon and 

Smith  (2010)  report  that  one-day-ahead  VaR(0.01)  based  on  historical  simulation  is  the 

standard in the case of international commercial banks. Second, we apply the Boudoukh-

Richardson-Whitelaw (Boudoukh et al., 1998) method of exponentially declining weights of 

historical  returns  because  Taylor  (2008)  commends  this  method  as  an  equivalent  to 

Exponentially Weighted Quantile Regression (EWQR) with one intercept and no regressors 

and shows that they may be able to outperform GARCH-based methods and CAViaR models. 

We also apply parametric approaches based on AR(1)-GARCH(1,1), AR(1)-EGARCH(1,1) 

or AR(1)-GJR(1,1)  models  with  Student  t  distributions  which  are  considered  as  standard 

benchmarks for the computation of risk measures (e.g. Du and Escanciano, 2017). Also, we 

apply  quantile  regression  (QR)  models  which  have  been  used  successfully  in  modeling 

extreme quantiles in electricity markets by Hagfors et al. (2016a,b) among others. Table 1A 

presents the models.  

[INSERT TABLE 1A HERE] 

3 For instance, ES(0.05) should be based on estimates of VaR(0.05), VaR(0.0375), VaR(0.025) and VaR(0.0125)

Next, we present the backtesting methods for VaR (Bin, POF, CCI, and DQ) and ES (UN-N, 

and UN-t) 4. The following Table 1B summarizes their principal characteristics    

[INSERT TABLE 1B HERE] 

With VaR, two tests (Bin, POF) focus on the proportion of failures (unconditional failure) 

and two tests on conditional failure for clustering (CCI, DQ). Besides results from traditional 

individual tests (e.g., POF, CCI), and to give an overall perspective of the results from the 

VaR backtesting exercise we present a combined p-value test for multiple hypothesis testing. 

This procedure follows the same principle of the mixed coverage test, Haas (2001). We use 

Fisher’s product test combining p-values to test the global null hypothesis H0 that each of n 

component null hypotheses, H1, …, Hn is true versus the alternative that at least one of H1,…, 

Hn  is  false.  As  Zhang  et  al.  (2013)  show,  Fisher’s  test  is  more  powerful  than  classical 

multiple tests such as the Bonferroni test and the Simes tests, especially when n is not large. 

The combined p-value test is based on the notion that several non-significant results together 

may suggest significance and hence detect departures from H0. The test is 

𝑛
𝐹 = −2 ∑ ln(𝑝𝑖)
𝑖=1

(7) 

that follows a 𝜒2𝑛

2   distribution under H0 and the assumption that the tests are independent. 

In  the  empirical  study,  we  assume  that  the  test  (7)  rejects  the  null  hypotheses  of  model 

adequacy  when  its  p-value  is  below  1%.  The  tables  show  the  number  of  times  and 

4 The technical details on models and backtesting test are in Appendix A.

percentages that data do not reject the overall Fisher test at 1% level for VaR and ES models, 

contracts, and countries. 

With ES, backtesting is more difficult than with VaR, Hull, and White (2014). ES estimates 

rely  on  a  smaller  number  of  observations  than  VaR  estimates  and  are  thus  less  stable, 

especially when the return distribution has fat tails (Yamai and Yoshiba, 2002). For instance, 

in the current Basel III regulatory framework, ES estimators are based on only 2.5% of the 

sample size used for estimating the VaR5. With ES, both unconditional backtests (UN-N and 

UN-t)  compare observed and  expected ES, but  assuming different reference distributions 

(Normal and Student-t). The expected value for the UN test statistic is zero, and it is negative 

when there is evidence of risk underestimation. To determine how negative it should be to 

reject  the  model,  we  need  critical  values,  based  on  distributional  assumptions  (Normal, 

Student-t) for the price returns. We check the consistency of the tests’ outcomes and report 

the p-value of each UN test separately. Notice that consistency implies that (i) if the UN-N 

test  shows  no  undervaluation,  the  UN-t  test  must  match,  (ii)  if  the  UN-t  test  suggests 

undervaluation,  the  UN-N  test  must  match.  An  inconsistency  arises  when  the  UN-N  test 

shows no undervaluation but the UN-t test says the opposite.

We collect daily prices of baseload futures contracts with one-month and one-year maturity 

in  the  period  from  January  2,  2008,  to  September  25,  2017,  from  the  German,  French, 

Spanish and NordPool markets. Price time series are continuous and computed as perpetually 

linked series6. For instance, in the case of the month series, the first data point on January 2, 

2008, corresponds to the price of the front contract M1 to supply electricity during February 

2008. On February 1, 2008, the price in the continuous series corresponds to the price of the 

front contract M1 to supply electricity during March 2008, and so on. Table 1C has a contract 

definition, codes, and sample period of all contracts and markets. 

[INSERT TABLE 1C HERE] 

In what  follows, we consider  the  full sample period7 (January  2, 2008, to  September 25, 

2017), the in-sample period for model estimation (January 2, 2008, to December 31, 2014) 

and the out-of-sample period for backtesting purposes (January 2, 2015, to September 25, 

2017).  Figure  1  displays  the  prices  of  the  futures  contracts  in  the  full  sample,  Panel A 

contains M1 contracts and Panel B shows Y1 contracts.  

[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE] 

After steep increases during 2009, the prices of the month contract show a downward trend 

6 Month contracts cease trading at the close of business, one Business Day prior to the last calendar day of the 
contract’s delivery period. However, usually there is hardly any trading volume after the day before the first 
calendar day of the delivery month. Year contracts cease trading at the close of business, two Business Days 
prior to the first calendar day of the delivery year.  
7 The number of data points in each sample varies across markets, due to national holidays and other market-
specific events. For instance, in Germany (NordPool) the figures for the full-sample, in-sample, and out-of-
sample are 2470 (2438), 1772 (1756), and 698 (688) respectively.

in the German market and, to a lesser extent, in the French and NordPool markets, but are 

steady in the Spanish market. Noticeable price increases, including price spikes, are apparent 

in the French market during November 2016 because of the combination of low temperatures 

and shortages in nuclear production because of extensive revisions in many facilities during 

this period (Commission de Régulation de L’Énergie, 2017). Prices of year contracts follow 

similar  patterns  to  month  contracts  but  are  less  volatile  and  spiky.  The  behavior  across 

markets  is  alike,  peaking  around  mid-2008,  and  then  rapidly  decreasing  in  all  markets, 

bottoming near the end of 2009, in coincidence with the financial crisis 2007-2009. Then a 

stable period ensues until 2013 where a downward trend manifests in the French, German, 

and  NordPool  markets,  bottoming  out  at  the  end  of  2015.  Prices  in  the  Spanish  market 

present a steadier pattern.   

We compute daily returns as the first difference in log prices8. Figure 2 describes the log 

returns over the full sample period and Panel A contains M1 contracts and Panel B shows 

Y1 contracts. 

[INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE] 

The  graphs  of  the  return  series  suggest  time-varying  volatility  and  volatility  clustering 

around supply and demand shocks, for instance, in the French market during November 2016 

8 In the continuous price series, a level change may appear on the days when trading activity moves from the 
old contract to the fresh one. This “rolling” event sometimes brings forth a jump in the return series, generating 
high volatility. Therefore, to avoid this artificial consequence, in days with “rolling” eﬀects, we set the returns 
on these days equal to zero, as is usual in the literature (e.g. Westgaard et al., 2019a, Blanco et al., 2018). Notice 
that those jumps are spurious outcomes induced by the definition of the continuous series, but they are void of 
economic consequences because the trader does not receive the return between old contracts and fresh ones. 
Specifically, with month contracts, we assume traders close their positions in the old contract the last Business 
day  before  the  delivery  period,  and  they  take  positions  in  the  new  contract  on  the  first  day  of  the  delivery 
period. Therefore, we set the return on that day equal to zero. With year contracts, and following the same 
logic, we set the return on the first day of the delivery period equal to zero.

or  in  the  Spanish  market  during  January  2014.  Several  positive  and  negative  spikes  are 

apparent, these features being more extreme in the case of the month series. Notice that a 

positive (negative) spike in the return series is caused by a positive (negative) level change 

in the price series. The literature usually relates the reasons justifying these jumps to events 

in the industry deemed to have a lasting impact on prices. For instance, on March 13, 2011, 

Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, ordered an emergency safety check at all Germany’s 

17 nuclear power stations in the wake of the Japanese earthquake (Financial Times, 2011a), 

and on March 15, 2011 (Financial Times, 2011b) she announced a decree to make seven of 

the country’s 17 nuclear plants idle. The German M1 and Y1 returns series show positive 

spikes  on  March  15,  2011,  of  15%  and  6%  respectively,  suggesting  an  expectation  of 

permanent increases in electricity prices during the corresponding delivery periods because 

of lower supply. Interestingly, in the French market, the month contract also shows a spike 

of 12% on the same date, but the year contract does not present an extreme return. Jumps 

are also apparent in the French market during November 2016, corresponding to the contract 

with delivery during December 2016 and related to lasting decreases in supply, as discussed 

above. In the Spanish market during December 2013 and January 2014 some positive and 

negative jumps bunch together, due to reduced supply in four out of the eight nuclear plants 

available, followed by unprecedented increases in Eolic production (CNMC, 2014).  

Table 2 provides descriptive statistics of the returns in all markets and contracts for the full 

sample in Panel A, the in-sample in Panel B, and the out-of-sample in Panel C.  

[INSERT TABLE 2 HERE] 

In  Panel  A,  we  may  observe  that  the  average  return  is  small  and  negative  in  all  cases, 

14 

 
 
 
 
suggesting  a  persistent  decrease  in  futures  prices.  Month  contracts  present  higher  price 

volatility  than  year  contracts,  as  expected.  Daily  return  volatility  in  month  contracts  is 

highest in NordPool (2.9%), followed by the French (2.6%), Spanish (1.7%), and German 

(1.6%) markets, and with year contracts results are alike. Although returns are negatively 

skewed  in  the  French  and  Spanish  markets,  and  positively  skewed  in  Germany  and  the 

NordPool, all of them are leptokurtic with  the Spanish  month contract  having the largest 

coefficient (18.5) and the NordPool year contract having the smaller (7.18). All the returns 

series  reject  the  null  hypotheses  of  the  Jarque-Bera  Normality  test.  Tail  risk  in  month 

contracts  as  measured  by  the  1%  and  99%  quantiles  is  more  extreme  in  the  NordPool  (-

0.079, 0.080) and French (-0.063, 0.082) markets than in the German (-0.045, 0.044) and 

Spanish (-0.050, 0.042) markets. The risk varies between the right and left tails, for instance, 

the French month contract presents a higher (0.082) right tail risk than left tail risk (-0.063). 

Year contracts present a lower tail risk than month contracts, as expected. The Ljung-Box 

test with 10 and 20 lags suggests auto-correlated returns in all cases. Results in the in-sample 

and  out-of-sample  periods  are  similar.  The  overall  picture  indicates  that  the  market 

generating  more  extreme  returns  is  NordPool,  followed  closely  by  the  French  market, 

whereas the German and Spanish markets exhibit fewer extreme returns. 

We now summarize how the return distribution changes over time. We have split our data 

set by years. Detailed results are in Table 1A in the Appendix. The key takeaway from Table 

1A is that the shape of the distribution of the return changes over time in all contracts and 

markets,  suggesting  a  time-dependent  tail  risk.  Figure  3  shows  the  time  evolution  of  the 

volatility,  skewness,  and  kurtosis  of  the  month  and  year  contracts,  usually  the  latter 

presenting fewer extreme values of these statistics than the former. 

15 

 
 
 
[INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE] 

With month contracts, we may see the volatility changing over time and reaching a peak in 

2014 in Spain, in 2015 in NordPool and in 2016 in France and Germany. These peaks are 

possibly  associated  with  shortages  in  nuclear  production  in  Spain,  Germany,  and  France 

during those years, as discussed above. Regarding skewness and kurtosis, the events of 2011 

in the German market are associated with peaks in skewness and kurtosis in Germany and 

France, suggesting an overall increase in the risk of the month futures prices in these markets 

during this period. Asymmetry changes sign over time in all markets and kurtosis peaked in 

2008 in Spain, in 2011 in Germany, 2014 in France, and 2015 in NordPool. All these changes 

point to changes also in tail risk over time. 

5.  Results and discussion 

In this section, we present the results of the models used to generate VaR and ES forecasts 

and study their performance as measured by the backtesting tests9. A summary of the results 

is in Table 3, panels A1(VaR) and B1(ES) for all contracts and markets together, A2 and B2 

for VaR with M1 and Y1 contracts, panels C2 and D2 for ES, also for M1 and Y1 contracts, 

and panels E1 and E2 for VaR and ES by markets, respectively10. Table  3 shows the number 

of times and percentages that data do not reject the overall Fisher test of model adequacy for 

all models, contracts, and markets at the 1% significance level. GT is the total for both tails. 

GTL is the total for the left tail (5%, 1%). GTR is the total for the right tail (95%, 99%).  

[INSERT TABLE 3 HERE]

10 Detailed results on results of individual test are in Appendix A.

With VaR (Panel A1), the best model is GARCH with 88% cases in which their adequacy is 

accepted by the Fisher test in both tails, with a higher success rate in the left tail (94%) than 

in  the  right  tail  (81%).  The  worst  model  is  the  HS  with  an  acceptance  rate  of  22%,  also 

showing a differential success rate between the left (31%) and the right (13%) tail. Regarding 

the other models, the ranking is EGARCH, GJR, EWQR, and QR with overall success rates 

of 81%, 75%, 44%, and 28% respectively, although the success rate is higher in the left tail 

than in the right tail. With ES (Panel B1), the best models are three GARCH-type models 

with an acceptance rate of 100% in both tails. The worst model is QR-COM, accepted in 

33% of cases whereas HS and EWQR present a success rate of 63%.  By contracts, Panel 

A2 presents VaR results for M1 and Panel B2 for Y1. GARCH and EGARCH models do 

equally well in both contracts, with a success rate of 88% and 81% respectively, but other 

models do better for M1 than for Y1. For instance, EWQR has a success rate of 56% in M1 

but 31% in Y1. Thus, although the volatility of the returns of Y1 contracts is lower than the 

ones of M1 returns, the Y1 contract’s VaR is more difficult to forecast. Panel C2 and D2 

present ES results for M1 and Y1, respectively. GARCH-type models have a 100% success 

rate in both cases. However, other models present better performance with M1 than with Y1. 

For instance, EWQR and HS do pretty well with M1 (100% and 88%) but less so with Y1 

(25% and 38%). Panels E1 and E2 present aggregate results by markets. With VaR, GARCH, 

EGARCH, and GJR have a success rate of 100% in the NordPool. In Germany, GARCH, 

and EGARCH present a rate of 100%. However, in the and Spanish and French markets, the 

success rate of the best GARCH model is 88% and 63% respectively. The performance of 

all models in the French market is worse than in the other three markets, excepting HS, that 

is rejected in all cases in the NordPool market. With ES the GARCH-type models are not 

rejected in 100% of cases in all markets.  

17 

 
 
An important point is whether the model’s rejection arises because of risk underestimation 

or overestimation. In Table 4, panels A-E we compare the expected number of VaR failures 

with actual failures in every market and contract (eight cases). We compute the deviation 

defined as (Observed Failures – Expected Failures)/Expected Failures. A positive (negative) 

figure shows that the model underestimates (overestimates) tail risk.    

[INSERT TABLE 4 HERE] 

The summary results in Panel E indicates that the HS method underestimates risk, with an 

average  deviation  of  34.56%  (M1)  and  62.24%  (Y1).  The  EWQR  method  also 

underestimates the risk with an average deviation of 25.64% (M1) and 37.10% (Y1). The 

QR-COM, underestimate risk with average deviations of 78.81% (M1) and 148.44% (Y1).  

The GARCH and EGARCH models misestimate risk between -0.25% and 6.54% whereas 

GJR overestimates risk by -2.99% (M1) and -10.83% (Y1). Risk misestimation in most cases 

is stronger for Y1 contracts than for M1 contracts, which agrees with similar results in Table 

3.    

In summary, the GARCH model presents the leading forecasting performance among the 

models considered, followed closely by EGARCH and then by GJR while the EWQR, HS, 

and QR-COM models are least accurate.  

As an illustration of the reasons why GARCH-type models outperform the other models, the 

following Figure 4 presents the VaR(1%) forecast in the out-of-sample (o-o-s) period with 

all models for the M1 contract in the German market. The results for ES(1%) are very similar 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
and available on request. 

[INSERT FIGURE 4] 

The graph in the upper left-hand side labeled “Backtesting GARCHs” shows the results for 

AR(1)-GARCH(1,1), AR(1)-EGARCH(1,1), and AR(1)-GJR(1,1). The shape of the forecast 

is similar across the three models and follows closely the temporal evolution of the returns. 

When a relatively large return appears, the VaR forecast moves up (in absolute terms) after 

a one-day lag and then goes back to normal levels quickly. If a cluster of extreme returns 

appears, the forecast adjusts to that accordingly. This fast adaptability is an embedded feature 

of  GARCH  models  and  one  of  the  reasons  for  their  popularity.  In  contrast,  HS  models 

produce a constant VaR forecast, that changes only when very large returns appear. After 

that, the VaR forecast remains at the new level for the number of days (e.g. 250) in that the 

rolling  window  contains  that  extreme  return,  even  when  consecutive  returns  are  small. 

Therefore, the HS method tends, at first, to underestimate risk and, after one big return, to 

overestimate  risk.  Given  that  HS  only  relies  on  the  recent  (one  year)  unconditional 

distribution  of  the  risk  factors,  is  likely  to  misestimate  the  changes  in  conditional  risk 

(Pritsker, 2006). Besides, the VaR forecast generated by the HS model is largely insensitive 

to volatility clustering if the returns in the cluster are not very high. Similar behavior to HS 

is  produced  by  the  EWQR,  although  this  model  presents  more  adaptability  to  volatility 

clustering.  Finally,  the  Quantile  Regression  (QR-COM)  model  generates  almost  constant 

VaR forecasts because the regressors have very low explanatory power, and therefore hardly 

impact the VaR forecast. Table 3 in the Appendix shows the correlations between the returns 

and  the  explanatory  variables.  They  range  from  -0.12  to    0.05  and  are  statistically  not 

different from zero. 

19 

 
 
 
The distribution of electricity futures returns exhibit heavier-than-normal tails. The tails of 

the return distribution decay in a power-law speed instead of the exponential speed as in that 

of the normal distribution. The GARCH-t model captures volatility clustering by modeling 

the dynamic of volatility, leading to a time-dependent estimate of the VaR and ES. Besides, 

the GARCH-type models capture the heavy tails, see Davis and Mikosch (2009), because 

GARCH processes have power-law marginal tails.  In this paper, we tested the GARCH-t 

(also EGARCH and GJR) model instead of the most often applied GARCH-Normal because 

the  evidence  in  McNeil  and  Frey  (2000)  show  that  the  GARCH  model  with  Student-t 

innovations is more efficient in forecasting the VaR, whereas the estimates from GARCH 

models with normal innovation underestimate tail risk (see also Mikosch and Starica, 2000). 

Next, we present the calculation of the tail index under the GARCH(1,1) model following 

Davis and Mikosch (2009). Let Xt be the (filtered of AR (1) terms) return series defined as  

 Where 

𝑋𝑡 = 𝜎𝑡𝑍𝑡

2 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1𝑋𝑡−1
𝜎𝑡

2 + 𝛽1𝜎𝑡−1

2

(8) 

(9) 

Where Zt is an iid sequence with mean zero and unit variance and the process (9) is second-

order stationary if (1 + 1) < 1, Nelson (1990).  The tails of the marginal distribution of a 

stationary GARCH(1,1) process  have  a power-law shape. This  implies  that  there is  a tail 

index k >0 and a positive constant c such that  

𝑃(|𝑋| > 𝑥)~𝑐𝑥−2𝑘

(10) 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
The tail index k solves the equation 

𝐸[(𝛼1𝑍2 + 𝛽1)𝑘] = 1

(11) 

Equation (11) can be solved numerically for k, assuming a specific density for Z and given 

values of 1 and 1. Given a sample of returns X*, we can fit a power function 𝑐𝑋∗

−2𝑘∗, to 

the specific tail (e.g. X* = X > Quantile(X, 0.95)) and compare estimates k and k* of the tail 

index. In the following Table 5, we present robust estimates of k assuming the GARCH(1,1) 

Student-t model with estimated parameters in Table 1B in the Appendix and estimates of k* 

in the right (95%) and left (5%) tail using the empirical distribution of returns. 

[INSERT TABLE 5] 

The average deviation between the GARCH estimate of the tail index k and the empirical 

estimate k* is 3.83% with the quantile 5% and 7.10% with the quantile 95%. Therefore, in 

most cases,  the GARCH model’s implied tails are close to  the empirical  ones, especially 

with the 5% quantile. This is the reason GARCH-t models capture the tail risk so well. On 

average  k is  1.47, higher than  k* (95%) which is  1.18 and  k (5%), 1.28. This  shows that 

empirical tails decay more slowly than predicted by GARCH models, especially beyond the 

95% quantile. This suggests that the right-hand tail is more difficult to model than the left-

hand tail. As a result, GARCH models are more adequate to investors taking long positions 

in electricity futures, a situation that also applies to other European energy futures markets, 

as documented in Westgaard et al. (2019a).  

6.  Conclusion  

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Agents in the deregulated electricity markets are well aware of the high volatility of prices 

and  so  have  an  incentive  in  implementing  risk  management  policies,  for  instance,  using 

futures contracts of different maturities. Thus, research on the tail risk associated with the 

prices  of  those  futures  contracts  may  help  market  participants  in  the  design  and 

implementation  of  their  hedging  and  trading  strategies.  This  paper  examines  some 

parametric  and  non-parametric  approaches  to  forecasting  VaR  and  ES  in  four  markets 

(Norpool, Germany, France, and Spain) in the period 2008-2017 for the futures price of two 

contracts extensively used by market participants, monthly and yearly contracts. 

The  empirical  evidence  suggests  that  AR(1)-GARCH(1,1)  models  with  t  distributions 

present  better  performance  than  historical  simulation,  EWQR,  and  quantile  regression 

models when predicting the VaR and ES in all markets and contracts. The reasons explaining 

this result are the ability of GARCH models of simultaneously capturing volatility clustering 

and fitting the heavy tails of the distribution of returns. However, the right-hand tail risk is 

more  difficult  to  model  than  the  left-hand  tail.  As  a  result,  GARCH  models  are  more 

adequate to investors taking long positions in electricity futures, a situation that also applies 

to other European energy futures markets. In addition to that, the performance of GARCH 

models  in  the  NordPool  and  German  markets  is  better  than  in  the  Spanish  and  French 

markets. Therefore, agents taking long positions in the NordPool, and German markets are 

advised to use GARCH-type models as a way of gauging the tail risk as well as a way of 

computing  regulatory  capital  requirements  and  setting  the  size  of  default  funds.  In  the 

Spanish  market  and  especially  in  the  French  market,  more  study  is  needed  before  a 

recommendation can be done. 

.  

22 

 
 
 Popular methods used in the industry such as the Historical Simulation method and more 

innovative methods such as those based on Quantile Regression misestimate the tail risk of 

electricity futures returns.  The reason is that HS models produce a constant VaR forecast, 

that changes only when very large returns appear. After that, the VaR forecast remains at the 

new level for the number of days contained in the rolling window. Therefore, the HS method 

tends,  at  first,  to  underestimate  risk  and,  after  one  big  return,  to  overestimate  risk. 

Furthermore, the VaR forecast generated by the HS model is largely insensitive to volatility 

clustering. Similar behavior to HS is produced by the EWQR, although this model presents 

more adaptability to volatility clustering. Finally, the Quantile Regression (QR-COM) model 

generates almost constant VaR forecasts because the regressors have very low explanatory 

power,  and  therefore  their  changes  hardly  impact  the  VaR  forecast.  The  regressors  (fuel 

prices  and  backward-looking  volatility  measures)  have  been  applied  in  other  commodity 

markets with some success, but in this case, their explanatory power turns out to be low. 

Searching  for  other  explanatory  variables  useful  in  the  case  of  electricity  futures  is  an 

interesting avenue for future research.  

The  policy  recommendation  to  financial  market  regulators  is  that  risk  weights,  and  the 

associated capital ratios to be required to investments in long positions these contracts should 

be computed using GARCH-type methods. The tail risk in short positions is more difficult 

to assess, and therefore more conservative capital requirements should be required. Widely 

used  methods  such  as  HS  produce  lower  capital  buffers,  increasing  the  risk  of  financial 

distress for the incumbent firms. As an added policy recommendation to the administrators 

of  futures  markets,  in  charge  of  setting  margin  account  regulations,  is  that,  although  the 

volatility  of  the  yearly  contract’s  returns  is  lower  than  the  volatility  of  monthly  contract 

returns,  forecasting  the  VaR  of  the  yearly  contract  is  more  difficult.  Thus,  margin 

requirements should be increased to account for this.   

23 

 
Looking  forward,  to  improve  this  study,  more  general  GARCH-type  models  could  be 

studied,  allowing  more  flexible  distribution  for  the  innovations  such  as  the  skewed-t, 

Extreme Value Theory-based, and the Normal Inverse Gaussian.  We also acknowledge that 

our empirical results apply for only a one-day-ahead time horizon. Thus, assessing the VaR 

and ES performance of the models for other time horizons (weekly, monthly) may provide 

useful information to market participants and regulators. Considering additional backtesting 

procedures, especially for ES in the line of Du and Escanciano (2017) is another promising 

area of study, that we left for future research.

Comments 

The Bin assesses if the number of failures is consistent 
with the VaR confidence level. 

The POF tests if the proportion of failures is consistent 
with the VaR confidence level 

The  CCI assesses the independence of failures on 
consecutive time periods. 

The DQ evaluates the existence of a correlation 
between failures, their lagged values, and the 
contemporaneous VaR estimate 

The UN-Normal tests if the average of the ES-scaled 
losses beyond VaR is consistent with the tails of a 
Normal distribution 

UN-t 

The UN-t tests if the average of the ES-scaled losses 
beyond VaR is consistent with the tails of a Student-t 
distribution with 3 degrees of freedom

Table 3: Summary of backtesting results 

This table reports a summary of the backtesting results. The table shows the number of times and percentages 
that data do not reject the overall Fisher test at 1% level for all VaR models, contracts, and countries. GT is the 
total for both tails and %GT is the proportion of no rejections (e.g. 0.13 means that in 13 out of 100 cases the 
Fisher test does not reject the null of model adequacy). GTL is the total for the left tail (5%, 1%). GTR is the 
total for the right tail (95%, 99%). With ES, we present the number of times and proportions UN-N and UN-t 
test does not reject the null of model adequacy. We check the consistency of the tests’ outcomes.
