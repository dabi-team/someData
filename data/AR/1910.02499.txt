Introduction and main results

The relevant problems involving powers of the Laplacian started with [1]-[2].

In conformal geometry, there has been considerable interest in the Paneitz operator
which enjoys the property of conformal invariance. In R4, the Paneitz operator is the

biharmonic operator ∆2, this can be refered to [3]. Recently, Zhang and Chen in [26]

established a sharp concentration-compactness principle associated with the singular

Adams inequality on the second-order Sobolev spaces in R4, and moreover,they

consider the following problem:

∆2u + V (x)u =

f (x, u)
|x|η

in R4,

(1.1)

where V (x) has a positive lower bound and 0 < η < 4, they got a ground state
solution of (1.1) under the A-R condition. In [14], let Ω ⊂ RN is a bounded domain

with smooth boundary, m is a integer and N ≥ 2m ≥ 2, the authors considered the

following Kirchhoﬀ problem

with positive lower bound, f (x, t) has an critical exponential growth behavior at

inﬁnity.

Since we will work with exponential critical growth, we need to review the

Trudinger–Moser inequality and Adams inequality, the latter is a generalization

of the former and more details are as follows: On one hand, let Ω denotes a smooth
bounded domain in RN (N ≥ 2), N. Trudinger [4] proved that there exists α > 0
such that W 1,N

(Ω) is embedded in the Orlicz space Lϕα(Ω) determined by the
N−1 , it was sharpened by J. Moser [5] who found the

Young function ϕα(t) = eα|t|

N

best exponent α. On the other hand,the Trudinger–Moser inequality was extended
for unbounded domains by D. M. Cao [6] in R2 and for any dimension N ≥ 2 by
J. M. do ´O [7]. Moreover, J. M. do ´O et al. [8] established a sharp concentration-

compactness principle associated with the singular Trudinger–Moser inequality in
RN . For more results concerning the Trudinger-Moser inequality and its application

in N -Laplacian equations, one can refer to [9, 10, 12, 13, 19] and the references

therein.

For Adams type inequality, let Ω ⊂ R4 be a smooth bounded domain. D. Adams

[22] derives

B. Ruf and F. Sani [24] extended the Adams inequality to R4, namely

sup
u∈W 2,2(R4),RR4 (−∆u+u)2dx≤1 Z

R4

(e32π2u2

− 1)dx < ∞,

where 32π2 is the best constant. In order to apply this inequality to partial diﬀeren-

tial equation more reasonably, Y. Yang in [25] proves the following singular Adams

inequality:

Theorem A. Suppose 0 ≤ η < 4, τ, σ are two positive constants. Then

sup

|x|η

dx < ∞,

(1.3)

where α ≤ 32π2(1− η

4 ) is the sharp constant. If α > 32π2(1− η

4 ), then the supremum

is inﬁnite.

In [15], Li and Yang studied the following Schr¨odinger-Kirchhoﬀ type equation

is related to the stationary analogue of the equation

proposed by Kirchhoﬀ in [17] as an extension of the classical D’Alembert’s wave

equation for free vibrations of elastic strings. In [18], Lions proposed an abstract

framework for the problem and after that, problem (1.4) began to receive a lot

of attention. In [16], the authors studied the following Schr¨odinger-Kirchhoﬀ type

equation

where M is a Kirchoﬀ-type function and V (x) ≥ V0 is a continuous function, A

is locally bounded and the function f has critical exponential growth. Applying

variational methods beside a new Trudinger-Moser type inequality, they get the

existence of ground state solution. Moreover, in the the local case M ≡ 1, they also

get some relevant results.

In this paper, we consider the following singular biharmonic Kirchhoﬀ-Schr¨odinger

problem

where 0 < η < 4, M is a Kirchoﬀ-type function and V (x) ≥ V0 is a continuous func-

tion, f (x, t) has an critical exponential growth behavior at inﬁnity. Using singular

Adams inequality and variational techniques, we get the existence of ground state

solutions for (Pη).
t
Let M(t) =

0 M (s)ds, we assume that M : R+ → R+ is a continuous function

with M (0) = 0, and satisﬁes

R

(M1) M0 = inft≥0 M (t) > 0;

(M2) for any t1, t2 ≥ 0, it holds

M(t1 + t2) ≥ M(t1) + M(t2);

(M3) M (t)

t

is decreasing in (0, ∞);

Remark 1.1. By (M3), we can obtain that 2M(t) − M (t)t is nondecreasing for

t > 0, In particular,

2M(t) − M (t)t ≥ 0 ∀t ≥ 0.

(1.7)

we require that f (x, t) = 0 for all (x, t) ∈ R4 × (−∞, 0]. Furthermore, we assume

the function f satisfying:

(f1) f is a continuous function and f (x, t) > 0 for all t > 0.
(f2) There exist constants α0, c1, c2 > 0 such that for all (x, t) ∈ R4 × R+,

f (x, t) ≤ c1|t|3 + c2(eα0t2−1),

(f3) There exist R0 > 0 and µ > 4, for any x ∈ Ω,

µF (x, t) ≤ tf (x, t)

∀|t| ≥ R0.

(1.8)

where F (x, t) =

∞
0 f (x, s)ds. This is the so-called the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz (AR)

condition.

R

We also give the following conditions on the potential V (x) :

(V1) V is a continuous function satisfying V (x) ≥ V0 > 0;

Deﬁne a function space

E = {u ∈ W 2,2(R4) :

where 1/t + 1/t′ = 1 and t > 1 such that ηt < 4. Thus we have Sp > 0. We now

introduce the following two conditions.

Our main results can be stated as follows:

Theorem 1.1. Suppose V satisﬁes (V1), f satisﬁes (f1) − (f5). Furthermore we

assume

5

(f6) There exist constants p > 4 and Cp such that for all (x, t) ∈ R4 × [0, ∞)

f (x, t) ≥ Cptp−1,

Then the problem (Pη) has a nontrivial nonnegative ground state solution in E.

Now instead the condition (f3), we assume that

(f ′

F (x,t)

|t|4 = ∞ uniformly on x ∈ R4. We derive the the results with-

out the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz (AR) condition.

Theorem 1.2. Suppose V satisﬁes (V1), f satisﬁes (f1) − (f2), (f ′

3) and (f4) − (f6).

Then the problem (Pη) possesses a positive ground state solution.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we give some preliminary results.

In Section 3, we study the functionals and compactness analysis. In section 4, we

prove Theorem 1.1.

In section 5, we study the results without the Ambrosetti-

Rabinowitz (AR) condition.

2 Preliminaries

In this section we will give some preliminaries for our use later.

Lemma 2.1 (see [26]) Suppose q ≥ 2 and 0 < s < 4. Then E can be compactly
embedded into Lq(R4, |x|−sdx).
Lemma 2.2. Let β > 0, 0 < η < 4 and kukE ≤ T such that βT 2 < 32π2(1 − η

4 ), 1

p + 1

p′ = 1, Then the result can
(cid:3)

be derived from Theorem A.
Lemma 2.3. If (f5) holds, then for all x ∈ R4, we have that H(x, t) = tf (x, t) −

4F (x, t) is increasing in t > 0.

Proof. Let 0 < t1 < t2 be ﬁxed. It follows from (f5) that

t1f (x, t1) − 4F (x, t1) <

t1f (x, t1) − 4F (x, t1) < t2f (x, t2) − 4F (x, t2).

This completes the proof.

(3.1)

where F (x, t) =

0 f (x, s)ds. I is well deﬁned and I ∈ C 1(E, R) thanks to the

singular Adams inequality. A straightforward calculation shows that

R4

Z

(3.2)

for all u, φ ∈ E, hence, a critical point of (3.2) is a weak solution of (P ).

Lemma 3.1 Assume that (f2) and (f4) hold. Then there exists positive constants

δ and r such that

7

I(u) ≥ δ for kukE = r.

Proof . From (f4), there exist σ, ǫ > 0, such that if kukE ≤ ǫ,

F (x, u) ≤

M(1)λη − σ
2

|u|4,

for all x ∈ R4. On the other hand, using (f2) for each q > 4, we have

F (x, u) ≤

|u|4 + c2|u|(eα0u2

− 1)

≤C|u|q(eα0|u|2

− 1)

for kukE ≥ ǫ and x ∈ R4. Combining the above estimates, we obtain

F (x, u) ≤

M(1)λη − σ
2

|u|4 + C|u|q(eα0|u|2

− 1)

for all (x, u) ∈ R4 × R. On the other hand, (1.7) gives M(t) ≥ M(1)t2, t ∈ [0, 1].
Fixed r > 0 and kukE ≤ r ≤ 1 such that α0r2 < 32π2(1 − η

Lemma 3.2 Assume (f3) is satisﬁed. Then there exists e ∈ Bc

r(0) such that

I(e) < inf

kukE =r

I(u),

where r are given in Lemma 3.1.
Proof . From (M3), we have M(t) ≤ M(1)t2, t ≥ 1. Let u ∈ E \ {0}, u ≥ 0

with compact support Ω = supp(u) and kuk = 1, by (f3), for µ > 4, there exists
C1, C2 > 0 such that for all (x, s) ∈ Ω × R+,

F (x, s) ≥ C1sµ − C2.

Then

I(tu) ≤

which implies that I(tu) → −∞ as t → ∞. Setting e = tu with t suﬃciently large,

we ﬁnish the proof of the lemma.

From Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.2, we get a (P S)c sequence {un} ⊂ E, i.e.

I(un) → c > 0 and I ′(un) → 0

as n → ∞,

we can choose un such that

so un is bounded in E. From Lemma 2.1, there exists u0 ∈ E such that up to a
subsequence un ⇀ u0 in E, un → u0 in Lp(R4, |x|−ηdx) and un(x) → u0(x) almost

we have γ ∈ Γ, and therefore

Consider the Nehari manifold associated to the functional I, that is,

and c∗ = inf u∈N I(u).
Lemma 3.4 Suppose M satisﬁes (M3), f satisﬁes (f5). Then c ≤ c∗.
Proof. Let u ∈ N , we deﬁne h : (0, +∞) → R by h(t) = I(tu). We have that h is

diﬀerentiable and

h′(t) = I ′(tu)u = M (t2kuk2)tkuk2 −

From I ′(u)u = 0, we get

By (M3), (f5), we conclude that h′(t) > 0 for 0 < t < 1 and h′(t) < 0 for t > 1.

Thus, h(1) = maxt≥0 h(t), which means

I(u) = max
t≥0

I(tu).

From the above argument, we see that h′(t) < 0 is strongly decreasing in t ∈ (1, +∞),

so h(t) → −∞ as t → +∞. Now, deﬁne γ : [0, 1] → E, γ(t) = tt0u, where t0 is a

real number which satisﬁes I(t0u) < 0, we have γ ∈ Γ, and therefore

c ≤ max
t∈[0,1]

I(γ(t)) ≤ max
t≥0

I(tu) = I(u).

Since u ∈ N is arbitrary, we have c ≤ c∗.

4 The ground state solution

In this section, we consider the ground state solution. We ﬁrst prove the following

convergence results.

Lemma 4.1 Suppose (V1), (f1) − (f5) are satisﬁed, let {un} is an arbitrary (P S)c

sequence, then there exists a subsequence of {un}(still denoted by {un}) and u ∈ E

such that

f (x,un)

|x|η → f (x,u)
|x|η
|x|η → F (x,u)

Proof. Let {un} ⊂ E be an arbitrary (P S)c sequence of I, i.e.

This completes the proof of the lemma.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.2 Let (M1) − (M3) and (f1) − (f6) hold. Then the functional I satisﬁes

the (P S)c condition.

Proof. By the process in proof of Lemma 4.1, we have that the (P S)c sequence

{un} is bounded in E. We claim that I(u) ≥ 0. Indeed, suppose by contradiction

that I(u) < 0. Then u 6= 0, set r(t) := I(tu), t ≥ 0, we have r(0) = 0 and r(1) < 0.

As the proof of Lemma 3.1, for t > 0 small enough, it holds r(t) > 0. So there exists

t0 ∈ (0, 1) such that

r(t0) = max
t∈[0,1]

r(t),

r′(t0) = hI ′(t0u), ui = 0,

By Remark 1.1 and Lemma 2.3, we have

lemma to obtain un → u strongly in E.
The proof of Theorem 1.1. Since I ∈ C 1(E, R), by Lemma 4.2, we have I ′(u) = 0

and I(u) = c. Therefore, by the deﬁnition of c∗ and c ≤ c∗, we know u is a ground

state solution.

Next, we will show that u is nonzero. If u ≡ 0, since F (x, 0) = 0 for all x ∈ R4,

from Lemma 3.4, we have

We will use a Cerami’s Mountain Pass Theorem which was introduced in [20, 21].

The detail is the following:

Deﬁnition A. Let (E, k·kE ) be a real Banach space with its dual space (E∗, k·kE∗ ).
Suppose I ∈ C 1(E, R). For c ∈ R, we say that {un} ⊂ E a (C)c sequence of the

functional I, if

I(un) → c and (1 + kunkE)kI ′(un)kE∗ → 0

as n → ∞.

Proposition A. Let (E, k · kE ) be a real Banach space, I ∈ C 1(E, R), I(0) = 0 and

satisﬁes:

(i) there exists positive constants δ and r such that

I(u) ≥ δ for kukE = r

and

(ii) there exists e ∈ E with kekE > r such that

Deﬁne c by

I(e) ≤ 0.

c = inf
γ∈Γ

max
t∈[0,1]

I(γ(t)),

Γ =: {γ ∈ C([0, 1] : E) : γ(0) = 0, γ(1) = e}.

Then I possesses a (C)c sequence.

15

Firstly, we check the geometry of the functional I under the weak condition.

Secondly, the key to establish the results in previous sections is prove that the

Cerami sequence is bounded. Once we will have proved this, the remaining parts

are similar.

Lemma 5.1. Assume that (V1), (f2)-(f4) hold. Then

(i) there exists positive constants δ and r such that

I(u) ≥ δ for kukE = r.

(ii) there exists e ∈ E with kekE > r such that

I(e) < inf

kukE =r

I(u),

Proof . The proof of (i) is similar as Lemma 3.1. From (M3), we have M(t) ≤
M(1)t2, t ≥ 1. Let u ∈ E \ {0}, u ≥ 0 with compact support Ω = supp(u), by (f2),
for all L, there exists d such that for all (x, s) ∈ Ω × R+,

F (x, s) ≥ Ls4 − d.

(cid:3)

From Lemma 3.1, Lemma 5.1 and Proposition A, we get a (C)c sequence {un} ⊂

E, i.e.

I(un) → c > 0 and (1 + kunkE)kI ′(un)kE∗ → 0

as n → ∞,

(5.1)

Lemma 5.2. Let {un} ⊂ E be an arbitrary Cerami sequence of I, Then {un} is

bounded up to a subsequence.

where τn → 0 as n → ∞. We shall prove that the sequence {un} is bounded in E.

Indeed, suppose by contradiction that

and set

then kvnk = 1. From Lemma 2.1, we can assume that for any q ≥ 4, there exists

n → v+ in Lq(R4),

derive that I ′(u) = 0 and I(u) = c. Moreover, we also get that u is nonzero and u

is ground state.
