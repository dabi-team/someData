The binary system AR Scorpii hosts an M-type main sequence cool star orbiting
around a magnetic white dwarf in the Milky Way Galaxy. The broadband non-

thermal emission over radio, optical and X-ray wavebands observed from AR Scorpii
indicates strong modulations on the spin frequency of the white dwarf as well as the

in the broadband non-thermal emission. Several interpretations for the observed fea-
tures of AR Scorpii appear in the literature without ﬁrm conclusions. In this work,

we investigate connection between some of the important physical properties like
spin-down power, surface magnetic ﬁeld, equation of state, temperature and gravity

associated with the white dwarf in the binary system AR Scorpii and its observational
characteristics. We explore the plausible eﬀects of white dwarf surface magentic ﬁeld

on the absence of substantial accretion in this binary system and also discuss the
gravitational wave emission due to magnetic deformation mechanism.

INTRODUCTION

stable stage of the stellar evolution. This is characterized by
the dimensionless compactness parameter deﬁned as

White dwarfs (WDs) belong to the family of relativistic com-
pact objects in the Universe. WDs along with other compact
objects like neutron star and black hole have extreme physical
conditions which cannot be produced in a terrestrial laboratory.
Hence, they provide natural sites to explore several funda-
mental laws of physics (Barack et al., 2019). Classically, the
astrophysical compact objects are formed through the grav-
itational collapse of a normal star which has run out of its
thermonuclear fuel for fusion. The core of such exhausted star
is no longer able to produce suﬃcient radiation pressure to
prevent its outer layer from gravitational collapse. In Newto-
nian gravitation, the mass of collapsing star (𝑀) is constant
even if it radiates (Mitra & Singh, 2013). Therefore, as radius
of star (𝑅) decreases during the collapse, the ratio of mass to
radius increases and leads to the extreme density in the ﬁnal

where 𝐺 is the universal gravitational constant, 𝑀⊙ is the solar
mass and 𝑐 is the speed of light in vacuum. In the general
theory of relativity, energy and momentum sources associated
with a massive object contribute to its gravity. Therefore, the
energy density or pressure not only opposes the self gravity of
the star but increases it also. The enhancement of gravity due
to pressure becomes dominant with increasing value of 𝜂 and
sets a critical mass beyond which gravitational collapse can-
not be avoided. However, the collapse of WDs is prevented
by the hydrostatic equilibrium between the inward gravity and
outward pressure of the relativistic degenerate electron gas
(Chandrasekhar, 1931a, 1931b). Static or non-rotating ideal
WDs have a mass (𝑀𝑤𝑑) less than a critical value given by
the Chandrasekhar limit (𝑀𝑐ℎ = 1.44𝑀⊙) and a radius (𝑅𝑤𝑑)

same as that of the Earth (∼ 104 km). If mass of the static WD
exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit (𝑀𝑤𝑑 > 𝑀𝑐ℎ), it becomes
unstable and yields to type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) explosion
which is an excellent distance indicator in the cosmological
observations. In the presence of strong magnetic ﬁelds or fast
rotations, the mass of a WD can exceed the Chandrasekhar
limit (Das & Mukhopadhyay, 2014; Ostriker & Bodenheimer,
1968). The progenitors of WDs have very low mass where
thermonuclear reactions are inhibited before synthesis of iron
(Fe). WDs are mainly classiﬁed as Helium (He-WD), Carbon-
Oxygen (CO-WD) and Oxygen-Neon (ONe-WD) with the
increasing progenitor or initial stellar masses and their underly-
ing composition (Camisassa et al., 2019). Because of the high
surface gravitational ﬁeld due to a large compactness of WDs,
heavy elements are diﬀused downward and therefore the atmo-
sphere around WDs contain mainly light elements like hydro-
gen (H) and He. From the presence of spectral lines, WDs are
divided into two groups namely DA and DB (Kleinman et al.,
2013). WDs belonging to DA group have H-rich atmosphere
and represent approximately 80% of the population. The atmo-
sphere of remaining 20% DB group WDs is dominated by He.
It is believed that CO-WDs in binaries form SNe Ia when their
masses reach the Chandrasekhar limit (Wang & Han, 2012).

WDs account for the ﬁnal fate of more than 95% of all the
stellar population in the Milky Way and are therefore consid-
ered as the most most abundant stellar remnants (Parsons et al.,
2020). The average mass and density of WDs are 0.6𝑀⊙ and
106 g cm−3 respectively. A signiﬁcant fraction of the WD pop-
ulation has a very high magnetic ﬁeld with strengths in the
range 103 G-109 G. Isolated rotating WDs and WDs in binary
systems are prominent Galactic sources in the Universe. In
this work, we investigate the physical properties of the WD
parameters in the binary system AR Scorpii which has been
discovered as a pulsating emitter at wavelengths from radio
to X-ray (Marsh et al., 2016). The paper is organized as the
following. A brief description of the observed features of the
binary system AR Scorpii is given in Section 2. In Section 3,
we derive and discuss various parameters from the physical
properties of WD in AR Scorpii. Finally, we have summarized
the study in Section 4.

AN OVERVIEW OF AR SCORPII

AR Scorpii was discovered as a binary system located in the
ecliptic plane near to the Galactic centre at a distance of d ∼
115 pc from the Earth (Marsh et al., 2016). It consists of a fast
spinning magnetized WD and an M-type main sequence cool
star (also referred to as M-dwarf or red-dwarf) as compan-
ion or donor. Both revolve around common centre-of-mass

with an orbital period of 𝑃𝑜 = 3.56 hours. The binary sep-
aration between WD and companion star is 𝑎 ∼ 7.6 × 1010
cm. A geometrical model suggests that the magnetic WD in
AR Scorpii is a perpendicular rotator and both open ﬁeld
lines periodically sweep the stellar wind of the companion
star (Geng, Zhang, & Huang, 2016). It means the spin axis
of WD is orthogonal to the magnetic axis. A bow shock
is formed through the interaction between the stellar wind
of donor star and beam of particles streaming out from the
open magnetic ﬁeld line regions. This shock propagates into
the stellar plasma and accelerates the electrons in the wind
to relativistic energies. The accelerated electrons produce
synchrotron radiation extending from radio/optical to X-ray
wavelengths (Geng et al., 2016). Broadband non-thermal
emission observed from AR Scorpii is modulated over the spin
frequency of WD and spin-orbit beat frequency of the binary
(Buckley, Meintjes, Potter, Marsh, & Gänsicke,
system
2017;
2016;
Singh, Meintjes, Kaplan, Ramamonjisoa, & Sahayanathan,
2020; Stanway et al., 2018; Takata et al., 2018). Therefore,
the binary system AR Scorpii is also dubbed as a WD pul-
sar which involves interaction between the magnetospheres
of two stars. However, the observed unique features of AR
Scorpii are very diﬀerent from the normal radio pulsars.

SCORPII

The pulsed emission from the binary system AR Scorpii is
assumed to be powered by a rapidly spinning magnetic WD
through the ultimate conversion of rotational energy into radia-
tion. From the observations of AR Scorpii, the mass and radius
of WD have been estimated as 𝑀𝑤𝑑 = 0.8𝑀⊙ and 𝑅𝑤𝑑 = 7 ×
103 km respectively (Marsh et al., 2016). The spin period and
its time-derivative for WD are originally derived as 𝑃𝑠 = 117 s
(1.95 minutes) and ̇𝑃𝑠 = 3.9 × 10−13 s s−1 respectively. A more
extensive observation involving high time resolution photom-
etry later (Stiller et al., 2018) suggests ̇𝑃𝑠 = 7.18 × 10−13 s s−1
which is about twice the original value derived by Marsh et al.
(2016). From these observed parameters, we investigate vari-
ous physical properties of WD in AR Scorpii under following
Subsections.

3.1 Mechanical

The mass of WD (𝑀𝑤𝑑) and ratio (𝑞) of companion star mass
to the WD mass are important initial parameters to describe
a binary system. For AR Scorpii the mass ratio is 𝑞 =0.375.
The mass ratio distribution helps in exploring the evolution of
companion stars over a given mass range and estimation of the

For WD in AR Scorpii, 𝐼𝑤𝑑 = 3.1 × 1050 g cm2 and 𝐸𝑟𝑜𝑡 =

down power or luminosity (𝐿𝑠𝑑) of the system, which can be

From the measured parameters of WD in the binary system AR

Scorpii, we get 𝐿𝑠𝑑 = 3.0 × 1033 erg s−1. The mean luminosity
of AR Scorpii for non-thermal emission is 𝐿𝑛𝑜𝑛−𝑡ℎ ∼ 1.6×1031
erg s−1 (Marsh et al., 2016). Takata et al. (2018) have esti-
mated the X-ray luminosity of AR Scorpii as 𝐿𝑋 ∼ 4.0 × 1030
erg s−1 from the observations. This implies that both 𝐿𝑛𝑜𝑛−𝑡ℎ
and 𝐿𝑋 are even less than 1% of the spin-down luminosity of
WD, suggesting that the rotational energy loss of the spinning
WD can suﬃciently power the non-thermal emission from the
binary system AR Scorpii. This is similar to the properties
of radiation emitted from the spin-powered neutron star radio
pulsars. The braking timescale over which rotational energy is
released or the spin-down time of WD is given by

From the above estimates, the value of 𝜏𝑠𝑑 suggests that the

Scorpii will slow down its spin on a timescale of ∼ 107 years.

Thermodynamical

A complete thermodynamical characterization of matter under
extreme physical conditions is given by the equation of state
which describes the pressure as a function of density and tem-
perature. The average density of a compact object is deﬁned as

For WD in AR Scorpii, we get 𝜌𝑤𝑑 = 1.1 × 106 g cm−3. A
WD with such a high density is in hydrostatic equilibrium due
to balance between the gravitational contraction and electron
degeneracy pressure. The degeneracy pressure of high density

electron gas in WD results from the Pauli exclusion principle in
quantum statistics which states that all the fermions (electrons,
protons, neutrons, etc) cannot occupy the lowest energy level
in a gravitationally bound system and therefore high energy
levels are occupied. The pressure of degenerate electron gas
(𝑃𝑑𝑒𝑔) is independent of temperature and the thermal pressure
(𝑃𝑡ℎ) of a WD is negligible. The equation of state of matter in
WD is modeled using diﬀerent approaches, the method pro-
posed by Chandrasekhar (1931b) is widely used to describe the
properties of WDs. In 1926, Fowler assumed non-relativistic
motion of electrons inside a dense matter distribution like core
of WDs and showed that (Fowler, 1926)

𝑃𝑑𝑒𝑔 ∝ 𝜌5∕3

(8)

In 1931, Chandrasekhar used relativistic Fermi-Dirac statis-
tics for degenerate electron gas and demonstrated that
(Chandrasekhar, 1931b)

𝑃𝑑𝑒𝑔 ∝ 𝜌4∕3

(9)

In this approach, the total energy density inside a WD is
determined by 𝑃𝑑𝑒𝑔 and energy density of nuclei without con-
sidering atmosphere of WD. Using this equation of state, the
degeneracy pressure of a WD for a ﬁnite temperature of the
core is given by (Chandrasekhar, 1931b)

𝑃𝑤𝑑 = 3.1 × 1014 𝜌4∕3

𝑤𝑑 erg cm−3

(10)

For WD in AR Scorpii, the electron degeneracy pressure is
estimated as 𝑃𝑤𝑑 ∼ 4 × 1020 erg cm−3. A surface temper-
ature of WD in the range of 9750 K - 12000 K has been
measured from various observations of the binary system AR
Scorpii (Marsh et al., 2016). From the Koester formula, the
relation between eﬀective surface temperature (𝑇𝑤𝑑) and core
temperature (𝑇𝑐) of a WD is given by (Koester, 1976)
𝑇𝑤𝑑 = 3.8 × 10−3 𝑔0.25

𝑤𝑑 𝑇 0.64

(11)

where 𝑔𝑤𝑑 is the surface gravity of WD. For 𝑇𝑤𝑑 = 9750 K
as estimated by Marsh et al. (2016), we get 𝑇𝑐 ∼ 107 K. This
indicates that the core of WD in the binary system AR Scorpii
is about three orders of magnitude hotter than its surface. The
thermal luminosity from the surface of a WD can be expressed
as

(12)
where 𝜎𝑆𝐵 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. For the case of
WD in AR Scorpii, the thermal luminosity is estimated as
𝐿𝑡ℎ ≈ 3.5 × 1030 erg s−1 which is about three orders of mag-
nitude less than the spin-down luminosity. This implies that
the non-thermal emission powered by the fast spinning of WD
dominates over the thermal emission of WD in AR Scorpii
binary system. The thermal age of spinning WD from the

𝜏𝑡ℎ ≈

gives 𝜏𝑡ℎ ∼ 109 years which is much larger than spin-down
timescale 𝜏𝑠𝑑 of WD in AR Scorpii. This suggests that WD in
AR Scorpii shines at cost of cooling over cosmic time longer
than its spin slowing down timescale.

3.3 Gravitation

The compactness parameter (𝜂) plays an important role to
describe the gravitational properties of the compact objects.
The strength of gravity of a compact object is measured in
terms of 𝜂. From Equation 1, the value of compactness param-
eter for WD in AR Scorpii is estimated as 𝜂𝑤𝑑 = 3 × 10−4,
which is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the Sun.
This indicates that the binding energy, which is directly pro-
portional to the compactness parameter, of WD in the binary
system is also very high as compared to the Sun. The escape
velocity from the surface of a compact object or WD is deﬁned
as

𝑣𝑒𝑠𝑐 =

√

2𝐺𝑀
𝑅

= 3 × 1010

𝜂 cm s−1

(14)

For 𝜂 = 3 × 10−4, we get the escape velocity for WD in AR
Scorpii as ∼ 5000 km s−1, which is approximately 500 times
the escape velocity on the Earth-surface. This implies that the
gravitational ﬁeld of WD in AR Scorpii is much stronger than
that of the Earth. The surface gravity of WD estimated as

√

𝑔𝑤𝑑 =

𝐺𝑀𝑤𝑑
𝑅2

𝑤𝑑

= 2.2 × 108 cm s−2

(15)

is about six order of magnitude larger than that of the Earth.
From the general theory of relativity, the space-time curva-
ture around a massive body is also deﬁned to characterize the
strength of gravity. The space-time curvature at the surface of
a compact object can be expressed as

For WD in AR Scorpii, we obtain 𝜅 = 2.3 × 10−21 cm−2
which is about ﬁve order of magnitude higher than the space-
time curvature at the surface of Earth. Thus, the surface gravity
and space-time curvature parameters estimated for WD in AR
Scorpii suggest that the strength of gravity associated with the
primary star in the binary system is much stronger than that of
the Earth. Therefore, it is expected that the WD in binary sys-
tem AR Scorpii should accrete matter from the stellar wind of
the companion M-star through the gravitational capture. If the
stellar plasma supplied by companion star has a large angular
momentum due to its orbital motion, an accretion disk should
be ultimately formed around WD in the binary plane of AR

where ̇𝑚 is the accretion rate. The amount of gravitational
energy release per unit mass is
𝐺𝑀𝑤𝑑
𝑅𝑤𝑑

106 cm
𝑅

= 1.32 × 1020

(18)
For WD in AR Scorpii, Δ𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑐 = 1.50 × 1017 erg g−1. The
gravitational potential energy released on reaching the stellar
surface provides heat for converting the accreted energy into
electromagnetic radiation through basic process of thermal
emission from the heated WD surface and hot plasma around
it. Assuming that the observed X-ray luminosity is powered
by the accretion from the companion star i.e 𝐿𝑋 = 𝐿𝑎𝑐𝑐, we
̇𝑚 ∼ 2.6 × 1013 g s−1, which is about two order of mag-
get
nitude lower than the accretion rate for typical white dwarfs
( ̇𝑚 ∼ 1015 g s−1). Thus, the little X-ray luminosity (∼ 4% of the
optical luminosity) measured from AR Scorpii (Marsh et al.,
2016) together with the absence of Doppler broadened spec-
tral emission lines suggest that very small accretion power is
produced in this binary system. Moreover, the high spin-down
rate of WD observed today implies a previous high accretion
rate responsible for its spin up stage, which contradicts the lack
of observational evidence for substantial accretion around the
WD in the binary plane of the system in the current stage. The
strong magnetic ﬁeld of WD can dominate the accretion ﬂow if
associated magnetic energy density is comparable to the total
kinetic energy density of the accreting plasma. This condition
is speciﬁed by a characteristic distance called Alfvén radius
which is expressed as (Shapiro & Teukolsky, 1983)

where 𝐵𝑝 is the surface magnetic ﬁeld of WD. In case of AR
Scorpii, 𝑟𝐴 ∼ 1.5 × 1015 cm corresponding to 𝐵𝑝 = 7 × 108
G. This indicates that 𝑟𝐴 for magnetic WD in the binary sys-
tem AR Scorpii is several orders of magnitude larger than
the binary separation and radius of WD. The inner edge of
accretion disk associated with WD in presence of strong mag-
netic ﬁeld is placed at 𝑟𝐴. In side 𝑟𝐴, magnetic ﬁeld dominated
plasma moves along the magnetic lines of WD. The plasma
frozen to magnetic ﬁeld lines may sweep up the magnetic ﬂux
of WD leading to building up of magnetic stress far away from
the stellar surface. This can ultimately halt the accretion ﬂow
on to WD from the companion star and accretion disk dis-
appears at places where magnetic ﬁeld controls the plasma.

Therefore, WD in AR Scorpii may be currently in a propeller
mass ejection phase with no mass transfer from the compan-
ion star. This together with higher value of 𝐿𝑠𝑑 suggest that the
WD binary system AR Scorpii is primarily rotation powered.

3.4

Electromagnetic

The gravitational properties of WD in AR Scorpii and its low
X-ray luminosity suggest no mass loss or propeller mass ejec-
tion phase in the binary system. The non-thermal origin of
X-ray emission from AR Scorpii (Takata et al., 2018) and sce-
nario of no mass transfer indicate a diﬀerent physical process
for draining the rotational energy from the rapidly spinning
WD. This can be attributed to the magnetic dipole radia-
tion from WD and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) interactions
(Buckley et al., 2017). The polar surface magnetic ﬁeld of WD
is given by (Contopoulos & Spitkovsky, 2006)

(
under the assumption that the spin-down power is same as
the energy loss due to a rotating magnetic dipole. The esti-
mated value of surface magnetic ﬁeld strength 𝐵𝑝 = 7 × 108
G using the observed parameters of AR Scorpii suggests that
the WD in this binary system is highly magnetized. The esti-
mated value of 𝐵𝑝 is broadly consistent with the upper limit (∼
5 × 108 G) derived from the polarimetric study of AR Scorpii
by Buckley et al. (2017). They suggest that variations present
in the strong linear polarization measured from AR Scorpii can
be described by a rotating magnetic dipole approximation of
WD in the binary system. The bulk of spin-down luminosity is
dissipated by the magnetic dipole radiation. The strong mag-
netic ﬁeld of the WD can generate the non-thermal high energy
emission from AR Scorpii through the synchrotron radiation
(Singh et al., 2020). The radius of WD light cylinder is deﬁned
as

For the spinning WD in AR Scorpii, 𝑅𝑙𝑐 = 5.6 × 1011 cm is
about eight times the binary or orbital separation of the sys-
tem and implies that the companion star is well inside the
magnetosphere of the WD. Therefore, the dense stellar wind
produced by M-type companion star would have enough elec-
tric charge to screen out the inductive electric ﬁeld unlike the
isolated radio pulsars (rapidly rotating neutron stars) which
produce very high electric potential drop along the magnetic
ﬁeld lines (Fawley, Arons, & Scharlemann, 1977). Under the

For WD in AR Scorpii, we obtain 𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑔 = 2.8 × 1033 erg s−1,

in the binary system AR Scorpii can suﬃciently provide the

G is in good agreement with the dipole magnetic ﬁeld of

try (Buckley et al., 2017). This is very small as compared to
the magnetic ﬁeld at the light cylinder radius of neutron stars
in the old as well as young radio pulsars. The corotation of
plasma is not possible beyond 𝑅𝑙𝑐 and therefore the magnetic
ﬁeld lines crossing the WD light cylinder open and converge
to the polar caps on the surface of the WD. The opening

In the binary system AR Scorpii, we get 𝜃𝑝 = 1.9◦ and 𝑅𝑝 =
2.5 × 107 cm. The light cylinder and magnetic polar cap are
high and low altitude sites respectively for the acceleration of
particles to relativistic energies. The structure of ﬁeld near the
light cylinder is not known completely in radio pulsar how-
ever 𝐵𝑙𝑐 is assumed to be very important for the 𝛾-ray emission
from these sources. The polar cap models for the high energy
𝛾-ray emission from well known radio pulsars are based on the
assumption that an accelerating gap exists above the magnetic
polar cap in the open ﬁeld line region. The region constrained
by open ﬁeld lines on the surface of WD (or neutron star) is
referred to as polar cap area which is given by

The polar cap area estimated as 𝐴𝑝 = 3 × 1016cm2 for mag-
netized WD in AR Scorpii is even less than 1% of the total
surface area of the WD.

3.5 Other Exotic Properties

The optical spectra of AR Scorpii show absorption lines vary-
ing sinusoidally in radial velocity on the orbital period (𝑃𝑜 =
3.56 hours) of the binary system and the atomic emission
lines in the UV/optical spectra originate from the compan-
ion M-type star (Marsh et al., 2016). WD is not visible in the
absorption/emission spectra of AR Scorpii. The cosmological
redshift of these spectral lines due to expansion of the Universe
will be negligible since AR Scorpii is a Galactic source. How-
ever, the gravitational redshift (𝑧𝑔) from the surface of WD for
a distant observer is given by (Özel, 2013)
1 + 𝑧𝑔 = (1 − 𝜂𝑤𝑑)− 1
For the compactness of WD in AR Scorpii, the gravitational
redshift 𝑧𝑔 = 0.00015, is very tiny. This suggests that wave-
length of a photon emitted from the surface of WD will
experience negligible shift with respect to the laboratory value.
The spin frequency of WD (𝜈𝑠 = 𝑃 −1
𝑠 = 8.54 mHz) represents
high frequency component of the amplitude spectra of the pul-
sations at UV/optical/IR and radio wavebands, whereas the low
frequency component is described by the beat frequency

where 𝜈𝑜 = 𝑃 −1
is the orbital frequency of the binary sys-
tem. The beat component with 𝜈𝑏 = 8.46 mHz is stronger than
the WD spin component and dominates the pulsation period
of AR Scorpii. The beat period represents orbital side band
of the WD spin period. Red and blue-shifted hydrogen emis-
sion lines on timescales of WD spin/beat period are detected
with radial velocities of ∼ 700 km 𝑠−1 relative to the com-
panion star (Garnavich et al., 2019). High temporal resolution
spectroscopy suggests a very a complex line structure of the
hydrogen emission lines observed from the binary system AR
Scorpii. However, the physical mechanism that accelerates
hydrogen to such high velocities is not clearly known.

Strongly magnetized and rapidly spinning WDs ﬁnd special
interest in the gravitational wave astronomy. The intense mag-
netic ﬁeld of WD causes asymmetry around its rotation axis.
This asymmetry can generate gravitational waves due to the
deformation of WD induced by the strong magnetic ﬁeld in
the binary systems like AR Scorpii. The amplitude of emitted
monochromatic gravitational waves with a frequency 𝜈𝐺𝑊 =
2𝜈𝑠, is given by (Maggiore, 2008; Shapiro & Teukolsky, 1983)

ℎ𝐺𝑊 =

For the rapidly rotating magnetic WD in AR Scorpii, we have
𝜈𝐺𝑊 = 0.017 Hz and ℎ𝐺𝑊 ≈ 8.5 × 10−28. In Figure 1 ,
a comparison of ℎ𝐺𝑊 for AR Scorpii with the sensitivities
curves for proposed space-based gravitational wave detec-
tors LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), DECIGO
(DECI-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory),
and BBO (Big Bang Observer) is presented. The sensitivity
curves for diﬀerent detectors in Figure 1 correspond to a
signal-to-noise ratio of 8 and integration time of 1 year. We
observe that the gravitational wave amplitude produced from
the spinning WD in AR Scorpii due to magnetic deforma-
tion mechanism is much below the sensitivties of space-based
detectors in the gravitational wave frequency range from 10−4
Hz to 10 Hz. A surface magnetic ﬁeld of above 109 G is
required for WD in AR Scorpii to produce gravitational waves
with amplitudes that can be detected by the upcoming space
detector such as BBO (Sousa, Coelho, & de Araujo, 2020).

SUMMARY

WD in the binary system AR Scorpii is the ﬁrst and only
strongly magnetized WD pulsating at UV-optical-IR and radio
wavelengths discovered so far. The properties of WD in AR
Scorpii suggest that it is very young and its spin is slowing
down on a timescale of 107 years. The spin-down timescale
is shorter than the characteristic age of WD whereas the cool-
ing age exceeds the probable age of WD. The surface and core

temperatures of 104 K and 107 K respectively show nice syn-
ergy with the observed features of AR Scorpii. Despite the
strong gravitational and magnetic ﬁelds of WD, the accretion
is not the main source of radiation from AR Scorpii, however
accretion from a previous stage is necessary for spun up of
WD because a WD is generally born with spin. The spinning
WD is assumed to power most of the non-thermal emission
from AR Scorpii. Under magnetic dipole approximation of
WD, its spin-down luminosity can suﬃciently drive the broad-
band emission from this source. The energy transfer from the
fast spinning WD is either through the collimated out ﬂow of
relativistic particles (jet) or by the direct inductive interaction
between the magnetospheres of WD and companion star. The
emission originates from the most dissipation region near the
companion M-star (Garnavich et al., 2019; Geng et al., 2016;
Katz, 2017; Singh et al., 2020; Takata, Yang, & Cheng, 2017).
Therefore, the spin of magnetic WD plays a very important
role in the pulsed emission of AR Scorpii modulated over the
spin/beat frequency. AR Scorpii remains a very promising and
challenging source yet to be fully explored, however, various
physical properties of WD investigated in this study would
provide future guidance to explore the features of WD binary
systems like AR Scorpii and AE Aquarii. These sources are
also possible candidates for gravitational wave detection using
better sensitive detectors in future. The broadband electromag-
netic radiation together with the gravitational waves would
better reveal the properties of compact objects in the binary
systems.
