abstract

Transitions among diﬀerent mechanisms of two-proton decay are studied in general. The introduced improved direct-decay model
generalizes the semi-analytical models used before and provides ﬂawless phenomenological description of three-body correlations in
2p decays. This is demonstrated by examples of the low-lying 16Ne state decays. Diﬀerent forms of transition dynamic are shown
to be highly probable beyond the proton dripline for the s-d shell nuclei. It is demonstrated that transition dynamic of 2p emitters
can provide means for extraction of a width of the ground-state resonance of a core+p subsystem of the core+2p system. Practical
applicability of the method is demonstrated by properties of the 14F ground state derived from the 15Ne → 13O + 2p decay data and
of the 29Cl ground state derived from the 30Ar → 28S + 2p decay data.

1. Introduction

In the recent years there were important advances in the
studies of two-proton (2p) radioactivity [ 1], and in general
of true two-proton decays [ 2]. These studies belong to a
general trend of spreading our knowledge about limits of
existence of nuclear structure as far beyond the driplines as
possible. The true 2p decay mechanism is realized under
certain conditions, in particular when the relation between
one- and two-proton separation energies (Sp and S2p, re-
spectively) makes sequential decay not possible: S(A)
2p < 0
and S(A)
p > 0 (for nuclei consisting of A nucleons). In the
light proton-rich nuclei, the true 2p decay can also be de-
scribed by the mechanism of democratic decay [ 3], which
results in distinct correlations between the decay products
and diﬀerent systematics of lifetimes compared to 2p ra-
dioactive decays [ 2]. The true 2p and democratic decays
are often characterized as direct decays to continuum in

contrast with sequential decay mechanism, which requires
population of intermediate narrow states. Transition to the
democratic decay dynamic from the true 2p mechanism is
typically deﬁned by the width Γr of the resonance ground
state with the decay energy Er in the core+p sub-system of
the three-body system core+p+p. So, in the most common
case the dynamic of the 2p emission is fully characterized by
S(A)
the three parameters: (i) the 2p decay energy ET =
2p ,
(ii) the ground state (g.s.) decay energy in the core+p sub-
S(A)
2p , and (iii) the width Γr
system Er =
−
of the intermediate state. As the width Γr is a function of
Er, then the delimitation of diﬀerent forms of the 2p decay
dynamic for the selected nuclide can be depicted by a kind
of “phase diagram” in the

ET , Er}
The transitions between diﬀerent forms of dynamic were
fragmentarily considered in the previous works [ 4, 5,
In the present work we consider systematics of the

nuclei beyond the proton dripline. The speciﬁc motivation
of the present work is quite pragmatic. Any phenomenon
of the transition type demonstrates abrupt changes of its
properties in response to minor variation of the parameters.
Such a sensitivity can be used for more precise derivation of
the nuclear parameters or for imposing limitations on their
relations. Among the parameters
, the most
interesting from practical point of view is the sensitivity to
the value of Γr.

The measurements of resonance positions can be per-
formed with a good precision by using the data obtained
with reasonable resolution and statistics. In contrast, the
experimental derivation of the state widths with comparable
precision requires much better resolution or/and statistics.
This could be not practically attainable for exotic dripline
systems. Moreover, there exists a broad “blind spot” in
the experimental derivation of the g.s. resonance widths in
the interval from
10 keV. The widths smaller
than
10 keV do not seem practically accessible by modern
invariant/missing mass experiments, while other methods
(in-ﬂight, plunger, etc.) are available only for long-living
systems with widths . 1 ps−1. We suggest an indirect
method for obtaining information on the width Γr of the
proton subsystems in the case of transition dynamic of two-
proton emission. The practical feasibility of the method is
demonstrated on the examples of 14F g.s. populated in the
2p decay of the 15Ne g.s. [ 6] and of 29Cl g.s. populated in
the 2p decay of 30Ar [ 7].

2. Dynamic of three-body systems near the proton

dripline

The ratio S(A)

p /S(A)

2p deﬁnes diﬀerent forms of nuclear dy-
namic in proximity of the proton dripline. The systematics
of the p and 2p separation energies for Ne and Ar isotopes
near the proton dripline is shown in Fig. 2. These nuclides
represent the lower and the upper parts of the s-d shell pro-
viding a nice illustration of the common trends here. One
can see that evolutions of S(A)
2p values are diﬀer-

and S(A)

p

ent, and the corresponding curves are intersecting in the
proximity of the proton dripline, causing a rapid change
of the dynamic properties of nuclides in this region. The
closest to the dripline particle-stable nucleus typically has
a borromean property (when an extraction of one proton
causes the whole three-body system to fell apart) with the
condition S(A)
2p . Particle-unstable nuclei located just
beyond the dripline often undergo 2p decay by the true or
democratic mechanism. In addition, a transition situation
is possible. Nuclei located further beyond the dripline pass
the transition area and arrive to a domain of sequential 2p
decays. The transition dynamic is quite probable situation
in the areas between the true (or democratic) and sequential
2p-decay dominance.

p > S(A)

3. Direct 2p-decay model

The derivation of the direct decay model for 2p emission
was considered in details in Refs. [ 9, 10]. The model is
based on utilization of simpliﬁed three-body Hamiltonians,
which allows a factorization of the Green’s function. Such
an approach can be traced back to the ideas of Galitsky and
Cheltsov [ 11]. The expressions originating from the reso-
nant R-matrix-type approximation [ 10] look very similar
to those arising in the quasi-classical approximation [ 12],
later used for 2p emission in a number of works [ 13, 14,
and Refs. therein]. However, the models may have impor-
tant diﬀerences discussed e.g. in [ 10, 15, 2].

The direct decay models of Refs. [ 9, 10] have several im-
portant disadvantages which we overcome in the proposed
approach. Namely, the decay amplitudes must be factor-
ized either in the “V” system [see Fig. 3 (a)], or in one
of the “Y” systems [see Fig. 3 (b), (c)].
In the “V” sys-
tem, the anti-symmetrization between identical protons is
very straightforward. However, the assumption of the in-
ﬁnite core mass is required in such a case. Also the in-
teraction between protons (including Coulomb repulsion) is
completely neglected, which leads to some over-estimation
of the widths. This type of approximation was called “no
p-p Coulomb” (NPP), see Eq. (21) of [ 9]. In the “Y” sys-
tems the Coulomb problem is eﬀectively resolved because
the ZiZj term of Coulomb interaction in X dimension is

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Zc while in Y coordinate it is Zc + 1. However, the con-
sistent anti-symmetrization is complicated here, and one of
the core-p resonances is not treated appropriately. That is
because of the X coordinate between the core and p.
In
addition, the Y is only approximate distance between the
core and p and coincide with it only in the limit Ac → ∞
“V”). This approximation was entitled
(in this limit, “Y”
“eﬀective p-p Coulomb” (EFC), see Eq. (22) of [ 9].

In this work we develop the improved direct decay model
(IDDM) which is based on simple R-matrix-type analyti-
cal approximations for amplitudes and combines positive
features of NPP and EFC approximations. We start from
the general expression derived in [ 9], however with mod-
iﬁcation which correctly accounts for angular momentum

Because the spin degrees of freedom can not be observed

4. The 16Ne decays

Properties of the IDDM are demonstrated by the exam-
ple of 16Ne 0+ g.s. and 2+ ﬁrst excited state, both decaying
into the 14O+p+p channel. The 16Ne decay data have been
compared with the sophisticated full-scale three-body calcu-
lations in Refs. [ 17, 16]. The obtained agreement was quan-
titative, so in this work we just compare the semi-analytical
model results with the complete three-body calculations in
order to avoid the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation procedure
needed for taking into account the response of the experi-
mental setup. The comparison of energy and angular dis-
tributions in the “Y” Jacobi system is presented in Fig. 4
and Table 1. In both cases we assume decay via single con-
1/2]0 for 0+ state and [s1/2d5/2]2 for 2+ state.

residue in between the NPP and EFC width values. NPP
and EFC models has diﬀerent deﬁciencies in describing the
momentum distributions in the 2p decay. The IDDM model
reproduces all qualitative features of the momentum distri-
butions correctly. E.g. pay attention to correct positions
and ratio of two peaks in Fig. 4 (c). For 2+ state the quan-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
titative agreement with full three-body calculations is not
expected as it is understood that several quantum conﬁgu-
rations are needed for description of the data [ 16].

So, we can see by the example of 16Ne decay that the
proposed IDDM combines positive features of the NPP and
EFC models, and it provides the results close to the sophis-
ticated three-body calculations. This makes the proposed
approach to be a reasonable substitute for the complicated
three-body calculations in the case of exploratory and sys-
tematics studies.

5. Transition patterns in the s-d shell nuclei

}

The transitions between diﬀerent decay mechanisms are
illustrated in Fig. 5 by calculated energy correlations of frag-
ments of the 30Ar decaying into 28S+p+p. For the ﬁxed
energy Er = 1.8 MeV, we provide series of plots in the
dimensions. The following evolution pattern can
ET , ε
{
be seen in Fig. 5(a). At low ET values, the decay mech-
anism is “true 2p”, which is characterized by a relatively
narrow bell-shaped peak centered at ε
1/2 (when ener-
gies of protons are equal). For ET > Er, two new peaks
connected with a sequential emission of protons arise on
the side slopes of the central bell-shaped bump. At energy
1.2Er = 2.2 MeV, the sequential-emission peaks be-
ET ∼
come higher than the peak at ε
1/2, and this energy value
marks a transition point to the sequential decay mechanism
(see also the sketch “True 2p”
“Sequential 2p” transition
in Fig. 1). In the correlation plot in Fig. 5(a), the trian-
gular structure can be seen, which corresponds to evolution
of the double-peak sequential decay pattern as function of
ET . At the energy ET = 2Er, the two sequential-emission
peaks overlap, then split again at higher energies ET .

Figs. 5 (b, c, d) corresponds to the same parameters,
except for the larger widths Γr, which is achieved by varia-
tion of the reduced width θ2 parameter in Eq. (5). We can
see that with increase of Γr, the triangular sequential-decay
pattern arises at higher energy ET but gradually smears out,
and ﬁnally it vanishes. This qualitative change means the
transition to the democratic decay mechanism. The evolu-
tion observed in the decay patterns from (b) to (d) corre-
sponds to the “Sequential 2p”
“Democratic 2p” transition
region sketched in Fig. 1.

↔
The panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 5 correspond to the θ2
values of 0.5 and 2.0, respectively. The ﬁrst value should
correspond to nuclear structure with strong conﬁguration
mixing. The latter value is the upper limit of the admissible
range for θ2, which corresponds to the pure single-particle

structure. The diﬀerence between the discussed ET evo-
lution patterns is quite large. E.g., the transition “True
2p”
“Sequential 2p” in the calculation (b) takes place at
ET value about 300 keV larger than in the case (a). The
unrealistically large θ2 values of 4 and 6 are used in the
cases (c) and (d). They are provided for illustration pur-
pose of the transition to the democratic 2p-decay mecha-
nism. It is obvious that the charge of 30Ar is too large to
allow the democratic decay mechanism be possible with the
used Er = 1.8 MeV value.

The evolution of 2p-decay mechanisms similar to the one
shown in Figs. 5 (a, b, c, d) can be achieved by variation
of a charge of 2p precursor. Fig. 6 illustrates this issue by
presenting several examples of the calculated transition pat-
terns ranging from light to heavy s-d shell 2p emitters. In
the calculated examples of 15Ne, 26S, and 34Ca g.s. decays,
we can see that the observed (15Ne) as well as the evalu-
ated 26S, 34Ca decay energies are located near the transition
points. This means that all considered cases are character-
ized by strong sensitivity of the decay correlation patterns
to the parameters of involved nuclear states.

6. Decay of the 15Ne ground state

First illustration of a possibility to utilize the 2p-decay
transition dynamic in order to study a core+p subsystem of
the core+p+p nucleus is provided by example of the 15Ne
g.s. One can see in Fig. 6, that the 2p-decay energy of 15Ne
g.s., ET = 2.52 MeV [ 6] is located in the region where the
ε distribution strongly depends on ET . The shape of the ε
distribution at ﬁxed energy can be considered as not very
reliable model-dependent indicator. However, the 15Ne g.s.
is quite broad, Γ = 0.59 MeV, and one may investigate the
evolution of the ε distribution as function of ET depend-
ing on model parameters. Figure 7 shows examples of such
distributions calculated for Γr(14F)
0.2 MeV, which corre-
sponds to lower and upper limits of the existing data about
the 14F g.s.: Er(14F) = 1.56(4) MeV, Γr(14F) = 0.9(2)
MeV [ 19]. The ε distributions calculated in the centroid
Γ/2 of the 15F g.s. resonance
ET and in the “wings” ET ±
may diﬀer from each other. They are also quite diﬀerent
in the case of diﬀerent 14F g.s. widths Γr(14F), which make
this type of information in principle extractable from the
decay correlation data.

Fig. 6. (Color online) Energy correlations as functions of the 2p-decay energy ET calculated by IDDM in the “Y” Jacobi system for 15Ne, 26S,
and 34Ca. The used {Er, Γr} values are {1.56, 0.9} [ 19] (experiment), {1.96, 0.12} [ 20] (theory), {1.55, 0.19} [ 21] (theory), respectively. The
vertical dotted lines mark the ET values accepted from the experiment on 15Ne [ 6] as well as from the systematics evaluations of 26S [ 8] and
34Ca [ 20] 2p decays. Thin dotted lines for 15Ne indicate the experimental value of the g.s. width Γ = 0.59 MeV [ 6].

6] is shown in Fig. 7(a). Unfortunately it is strongly broad-
ened by the experimental resolution and the statistics is not
suﬃcient to study the ET evolution. Evidently this infor-
mation can not be used for the proposed analysis. However,
if we look in the analogous data for the 16Ne g.s. decay [
17] we can ﬁnd that much higher accuracy is possible in the
modern experiment. The resolution in [ 17] is high enough
to potentially resolve the solid and dotted curves in Fig.
7(a) or dashed and solid curves in Fig. 7(b). So, the pro-
posed type of analysis is principally feasible with modern
experimental techniques.

7. Decay of the 30Ar ground state

The observation of 30Ar and 29Cl isotopes was reported
recently [ 7]. It was concluded that the 2p decay of the 30Ar
g.s. belongs to a transition dynamic. However, the analysis
was attempted in a simpliﬁed way with the decay energy
as the only parameter. We analyze the 30Ar data by calcu-
lations based on the IDDM. Several calculated correlations
and the respective “experimental” distributions obtained by
simulating the setup response (in the same way as described
in [ 7]) are shown in Fig. 8 together with the experimental
data. The experimental setup of [ 7] allowed for reconstruct-
ing of transverse momentum distributions of the 2p-decay
products, though the distributions were strongly aﬀected by
the setup response. However, one can see in Fig. 8 that the
speciﬁc patterns connected with a formation of sequential-
decay correlations in the 30Ar g.s. produce the respective
changes in the angular distributions 28S-p.

We have systematically studied reasonable combinations

in order to obtain the best ﬁt of
the data. The obtained simulation results have been com-
pared to the data by the Kolmogorov test, which has pro-
vided the probability of the matching simulation and ex-
perimental histograms, see Fig. 9. The ﬁrst assigned pa-
rameters in Ref. [ 7] were ET = 2.25+15
−10 MeV, Er = 1.8(1)
MeV. We infer less uncertain value ET = 2.45+5
−10 MeV on
the basis of analysis shown in Fig. 9, and also the width
of 29Cl g.s. is derived as Γr = 85(30) keV. We emphasize
that in this analysis uncertainties of the major parameters
correlate, which can be used for further limitations. For ex-
15
ample, it is shown in Fig. 9(d) that even smaller ∆Γr ∼
keV can be established for the ﬁxed ET value. We note
that this type of analysis is in the “proof of the concept”
stage, and in prospect it should be validated by the direct
measurements.

8. Stability of IDDM results

The proposed derivation of width of the core-p g.s. from
the “Y” system energy distributions depends on the stabil-
ity of the distributions to the model parameters. We have
systematically studied such sensitivity and found that the
only signiﬁcant dependence is to the general decay parame-
ters
. E.g., transition patterns strongly depend
on the interference of two-body amplitudes at resonant and
near-resonant energy. However, Fig. 10 shows that realis-
tic modiﬁcation of amplitudes outside of the resonance peak
does not lead to signiﬁcant changes in the typical considered
situation.

ET , Er, Γr}

{

The other important assumption is that only one quan-
tum conﬁguration provides dominating contribution to the
decay width of the state. However, this is a natural situa-
tion for the transition dynamic, which is connected to the
strong increase of the width just in one selected channel.
This issue can be estimated theoretically elsewhere.

of three general parameters, ET , Er, and Γr. The mo-
mentum distributions of the decay fragments in transition
regions between these decay mechanisms demonstrate dra-
matic changes within narrow ranges of the general 2p-decay
parameters.

The behavior of the momentum distributions of 2p-decay
products in the transition regions is described by the im-
proved semi-analytical direct decay formalism. In contrast
to the previously-used approximations, the applied model
depicts all qualitative features of 2p-decay distributions in
the whole kinematical space. The model works in the men-
tioned 2p-decay regimes as well as in their transition regions.
In the transition regions, momentum distributions of the
decay products demonstrate strong sensitivity to the varia-
tion of general 2p-decay parameters. Therefore experimen-
tal data in transition regions can be used for a precise ex-
traction of resonance parameters in the core-p subsystem of
the 2p-decay precursor. Practical feasibility of such an ap-
proach has been demonstrated by the example of the 15Ne
g.s. 2p-decay. By assuming the transition dynamic, we have
established more narrow boundaries for the parameters ET ,
Er, and Γr for the 30Ar and 29Cl g.s. in comparison with
those derived in Ref. [ 7].
