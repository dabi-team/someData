Abstract— Wind speed forecasting has received a lot of attention in the recent past from researchers due 
to  its  enormous  benefits  in  the  generation  of  wind  power  and  distribution.  The  biggest  challenge  still 
remains  to  be  accurate  prediction  of  wind  speeds  for  efficient  operation  of  a  wind  farm.  Wind  speed 
forecasts can be greatly improved by understanding its underlying dynamics. In this paper, we propose a 
method of time series partitioning where the original 10 minutes wind speed data is converted into a two-
dimensional  array  of  order  (N  x  144)  where  N  denotes  the  number  of  days  with  144  the  daily  10-min 
observations.  Upon  successful  time  series  partitioning,  a  point  forecast  is  computed  for  each  of  the  144 
datasets extracted from the 10 minutes wind speed observations using an Auto-Regressive (AR) process 
which  is  then  combined  together  to  give  the  (N+1)st  day  forecast.  The  results  of  the  computations  show 
significant  improvement  in  the  prediction  accuracy  when  AR  model  is  coupled  with  time  series 
partitioning.

INTRODUCTION 

Wind  energy  is  known  globally  to  be  the  fastest  growing  sources  of  alternative  energy.  It  is  clean,  green, 
abundant, environmentally friendly and cheap source of electricity once it is up and operational. By 2050, it is 
projected that the energy demand could double with the overall global population increase [1]. Each megawatt of 
generated wind power saves at least 500 kgs of green house gases from being emitted into the atmosphere when 
compared to power generated from gas or coal, thus making wind power one of the most ecologically friendly 
sources of energy [2]. According to Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), there has been a steady growth of 
wind power generation with the total installed capacity of approximately 318 GW as of year-end 2013 such that if 
the growth of wind power generation continues at the current rate, it would account for  more than 12% of the 
total energy demands by the year 2020 [3]. From identifying the appropriate sites to environmental strategies and 
planning, deployment of large scale wind energy presents a wide range of challenges that must be addressed for a 
more  cost  effective  and  reliable  wind  system.  Exploiting  opportunities  in  strategic  areas  like  resource,  design, 
operation, integration, and social and environmental impacts can significantly optimize the performance and cost 
associated with wind power operation. For a long term R&D, International Energy Agency Wind identified and 
documented  four  general  research  topic  to  be  pursued  by  the  international  wind  community,  namely, 
characterizing  the  wind  resource,  developing  next  generation  wind  power  technology,  wind  integration  and 
increasing the social acceptance of wind energy [4]. Wind speed prediction which comes under characterization is 
one of the important fields of interest since it may help the utility operators to decide how much power to order 
from traditional sources in order to balance demand and supply at the grid [5]. Wind power is a function of wind 
speed and prior knowledge of wind speed of the order of a couple of hours to a day ahead  are useful in framing a 
good transmission plan with least possible risk [6]. Apart from transmission planning, integrating highly variable 
wind  power  into  grid  is  also  associated  with  some  other  operational  and  technical  challenges  which  includes 
power  system  operating  cost,  power  quality,  power  imbalances,  and  power  system  dynamics  [7]  and 
improvement  in  prediction  accuracy  ranging  from  seconds  to  a  few  minutes  are  useful  in  addressing  these 
challenges [8]. The literature on the various methods of predicting wind speed can be broadly broken down into 
two  types  of  models:  physical  models,  such  as  Numerical  Weather  Prediction  model  (NWP),  using  physical 
considerations of various atmospheric parameters to obtain the best possible estimate and statistical models using 
statistical  techniques. Although  in  a  stable  atmospheric  condition  physical  models  are  very  good  in  identifying 
recurring patterns and there by predicting long term future, the computational complexity associated in solving 
such mathematical models makes them unreliable for short term predictions [9; 10]. The method of persistence, 
which  assumes  the  future  value  as  the  last  observed  one,  is  the  simplest  prediction  scheme  [11]  and  mostly 
regarded as the baseline model when assessing the forecasting performance of a proposed model [12].  The new 
reference  method,  a  simple  modified  version of  persistence  method  with  a  trend  towards  the  mean  of  the  time 
series is capable to achieve 10% RMS error improvements over persistence [13].  Many statistical models suitable

for historical measurements of wind speed are available in literature. The capability of Gaussian distribution in 
explaining  random  variations  in  wind  over  time  explained  by  [14]  is  one  of  the  first  time  series  model  based 
papers in this field.  In the aim of  reducing prediction error combination of  different forecast techniques,  mixing 
physical  and  statistical  models  or  short-term  and  medium-term  models,  called  hybrid  methods  are  also  been 
experimented  by  many  researchers  [15;  16;  12;  17].  Suitability  of  non-linear  models  in  analyzing  dynamical 
variations  of  wind  resource  and  improving  short  term  prediction  of  wind  speed  has  also  been  studied  by  [18].  
The occurrence of wind is highly uncertain, no single technique can be used universally across all locations and 
time  scales  for  predicting  wind  speed  and  there  is  always  a  space  for  new  techniques  in  the  aid  of  improving 
prediction  accuracy.    In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  method  of  prediction  where  wind  speed  time  series 
partitioned into a number of time series depending upon length of the prediction time. The method is explained in 
the following section.   

II.  METHODOLOGY  

A.  Time Series Partitioning 

A function f(t) is said to be periodic with period h if f(t+h) = f(t) for all t such that the time series f(t), f(t+h), 
f(t+2h), …, f(t+2nh) will be a constant time series with simplified predictability. This periodic component can 
be  utilised  in  improving  the  prediction  accuracy  of  wind  speed  time  series,  thus  we  investigate  the  diurnal 
periodicity present in the wind speed time series. The data considered in this work is the wind speed time series 
data measured at 80 meters high mast at interval of 10 minutes at location; Latitude: 34.98420oN and Longitude: 
104.03971 oW constituting 144 measurements in a day. We employ continuous wavelet transform to investigate 
the strength of the diurnal periodicity in the wind speed data.  The analysis shows strong diurnal oscillations in 
the data.  Consider the wind speed time series s1, s2,s3… We construct an two dimensional array A of order (N x 
144) as follows;

where N denotes the number of days, i.e., each row denotes each day’s  measurements. In order to get prediction 
of  (N+1)st  day  forecast,  a  point  forecast  for  each  column  is  done  using  AR  model.    Even  though  wind  speed 
oscillations are not strictly periodic, the diurnal periodicity is very strong in wind speed data. Hence each row in 
the above array contains unstable periodicities and thus the proposed method utilizes this property to improve 
the prediction accuracy.  

B.  Continuous Wavelet Transform 

Most  of  the  time  series  analysis  techniques  assume  a  systematic  pattern  in  the  data  and  the  most  fundamental 
pattern in many time series is the frequency of compilation or the periodicity of the data. To identify the cyclical 
components hidden in the data, spectrum analysis on time series is a good tool since it is capable of exploring the 
seasonal  fluctuations  of  different  lengths.  For  all  possible  frequencies  the  power  or  strength  of  each  periodic 
component  can  also  be  obtained  from  the  spectrum.  For  non-stationary  data  like  wind  speed  time  series, 
amplitude and frequency changes with time and traditional spectral analysis methods like fast-Fourier Transform 
(FFT)  are  incapable  of  providing  information  about  time  at  which  power  and  frequency  variations  occurs. 
Simultaneous  analysis  of  high  and  low  frequency  fluctuations  in  the  time  series  is  relevant  in  these  cases  and 
Wavelet Transform is well known technique for the same.  

Wavelets are filters used to decompose the original time series data into different sub-bands in terms of time and 
frequency in order to resolve its fine structures [19]. For the decomposing process Wavelet Transform  method 
uses a small wave called mother wavelet, which is then scaled and shifted along the length of the signal to obtain 
daughter  wavelets.  Based  on  orthogonality  we  can  classify  wavelet  transform  as  the  continuous  wavelet 
transform: which uses non-orthogonal set of wavelets and the discrete wavelet transform: uses a set of orthogonal 
wavelets.  For  transforming  the  signal  into  the  time-frequency  domain  one  may  use  a  basis  function  or  mother 
wavelet Ψ in which scaling and shifting is applied. The wavelet at the scale (cid:1853) and the position (cid:1854) can be expressed 
as; 

(cid:2032)(cid:3028),(cid:3029)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667) =

(cid:1872) ∈ (cid:1844), (cid:1853), (cid:1854) ∈ (cid:1844), (cid:1853) > 0

In  other  words, (cid:1853)  is  the  scaling parameter  which  is dilated  or  shortened  to  extract detailed  information  in  the 
signal and (cid:1854) corresponds to translation parameter which helps in analyzing the signal (cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667) around the point (cid:1854). 
Wavelet transform of a signal(cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667) is defined as, 

(cid:1849)(cid:3033)(cid:4666)(cid:1853), (cid:1854)(cid:4667) =

(cid:3505) (cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667)(cid:2032)(cid:3028),(cid:3029)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667)dt

dw 

is  the  admissibility  constant  which  ensures  ω  the  existence  of  inverse  wavelet.  The  symbol    denotes  Fourier 
transform. Now the inverse transform gives the wavelet decomposition of the signal (cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667) which is defined as; 

(cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667) =

(cid:3509) (cid:1849)(cid:3033)(cid:4666)(cid:1853), (cid:1854)(cid:4667)(cid:2032)(cid:3028), (cid:1854)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667)

Decomposition of the time series data into several components as a function of both time and frequency aid, not 
only in quantifying constant periodic components hidden in the data but with information about when they 
are present.

C.  Auto-regressive Process 
An auto-regressive (AR) model is commonly used for describing time-varying processes by assuming a linear 
relationship between output variable and its own historical values. In other words auto-regressive model is just 
like a multiple regression model where the response variable depends on a set of predictor variables, where the 
predictor variables are a set of lagged time series. For example, an AR(cid:4666)(cid:1868)(cid:4667) model is denoted by; 

(cid:1850)(cid:3047) = (cid:2009)(cid:2869)(cid:1850)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:2869) (cid:3397) (cid:2009)(cid:2870)(cid:1850)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:2870) (cid:3397) ... (cid:3397) (cid:2009)(cid:3043)(cid:1850)(cid:3047)(cid:2879)(cid:3043) (cid:3397) (cid:2013)(cid:3047) 

where (cid:2009)(cid:2869), (cid:2009)(cid:2870),..., (cid:2009)(cid:3043) are model coefficients, (cid:2013)(cid:3047) is independent and identically distributed random variable or white 
noise. An optimum choice of  model coefficients in AR is important for prediction and while the simplest series 
AR(1)  restricts (cid:2009)(cid:2869)between -1 and +1, AR(2) has (cid:2009)(cid:2870) values  between -1 and +1 and (cid:2009)(cid:2869) (cid:3397) (cid:2009)(cid:2870) and (cid:2009)(cid:2869) − (cid:2009)(cid:2870)less than 
1.   

In this paper, the AR coefficients are estimated using the Burg algorithm method which fits an Auto-
Regressive model to the input data through minimization of the forward and backward prediction errors while 
constraining the AR parameters to satisfy the Levinson-Durbin recursion thus providing more stable and robust 
model parameter estimates [20]. Auto-Regressive models have become more popular for their computational 
efficiency and simplicity though just like any other stochastic method, the forecast tend towards the mean of the 
data as prediction period increases.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The wind speed data used for analysis are 10-minute resolution data obtained from the National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory, (http://www.nrel.gov), USA for the period from January 2004 to January 2007 measured at 
different  locations  across  United  States.  In  this  paper,  we  introduce  a  new  method  for  day  ahead  forecasting 
through the use of time series partitioning discussed in the previous section. The idea is to rearrange the measured 
wind speed data into several partitions of lag one day and model time series with AR technique to predict one 
step ahead. Specifications for proper partition of single time series into multiple series can be obtained from the 
wavelet spectrum which will identify the time of strong periodicity. For the present work we have used Morlet 
wavelet as the baseline  to analyze the frequency structure of time series and the mother Morlet wavelet used for 
analysis is; 

(cid:2032)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667) = π

(cid:2879)(cid:2869)
(cid:2872) (cid:1857)(cid:3036)(cid:3104)(cid:3047)(cid:1857)

(cid:2879)(cid:3047)(cid:3118)
(cid:2870)  

Wavelet daughters can be generated as discussed in the previous section and the choice of scale a determines the 
length  of  the  series  in  the  frequency  domain  that  may  be  covered  by  wavelet.  Usually  scale  parameter  for  the 
wavelet  transform  is  fixed  in  fractional  powers  of  two.  Once  the  series  transformed  into  wavelet  components 
time-frequency or time-period wavelet energy density can be obtained from the modulus of wavelet transform as  

Power(cid:4666)(cid:2028), (cid:1871)(cid:4667) =

.|Wave(cid:4666)(cid:2028), (cid:1871)(cid:4667)|(cid:2870) 

and it is called as wavelet power spectrum.  

From  the  wavelet  spectrum  shown  in  Figure  1,  presence of  a  strong periodicity  associated  with  the  diurnal 
variation  in  wind  speed  is  evident  at  approximately  144th  period  and  thus  the  choice  of  144  columns  in  the 
partition is made. In other words, since the data of consideration is of 10-min resolution, 144 data points comprise 
one day and the time series is partitioned into 144 different time series as represented by matrix A in section II. 
Each column is predicted one step ahead which constitutes a day ahead prediction using AR model. The results 
have  shown  that  by  partitioning  the  time  series,  prediction  is  greatly  improved  when  compared  to  predictions 
from a simple AR method. Figures 2 shows one day ahead prediction results obtained from a simple AR method 
and the proposed time series partitioning method with AR on wind speed data for location, ( Latitude: 34.98420; 
Longitude: -104.03971), along with the observed wind speeds. The performance of simple AR is comparable to 
the new method initially but its predictions deviate from actual values and level off to the mean value after a short 
duration. However the proposed method captures the overall underlying dynamics in the data much better.

To assess the performance of the proposed method, hourly root mean squared error was computed for the four 
different  time  intervals  and  its  averaged  root  mean  squared  error  is  shown  in  Figure  3  above.  It  is  clear  that 
partitioning the time series and then forecasting using simple AR model outperforms the AR prediction without 
time series partitioning.  

IV. 

CONCLUSION 

The auto-regressive models have widely been used to model and predict wind speed time series. However the 
general weakness of the model is that, after faithfully capturing the initial values, it level off to the mean value.  
In this work we introduce a time series partitioning procedure to improve the accuracy of the prediction. The 
advantage of the partitioning that we need to predict only one step ahead for each time series to make one day 
ahead predictions whereas without partitioning one needs to predict 144 step ahead. The results have shown a 
significant  improvement  in  the  prediction  accuracy.  The  proposed  method  proved  to  be  simple  and 
computationally efficient and it can be used by wind farm operators as an efficient day-ahead prediction tool for 
wind  power  generation  since  accurate  speed  predictions  are  critical  in  grid-connected  power  distribution  and 
management.
