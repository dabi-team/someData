ABSTRACT

Large-scale propagating fronts are frequently observed during solar eruptions, yet it is open whether
they are waves or not, partly because the propagation is modulated by coronal structures, whose
magnetic ﬁeld we still cannot measure. However, when a front impacts coronal structures, an op-
portunity arises for us to look into the magnetic properties of both interacting parties in the low-β
corona. Here we studied large-scale EUV fronts accompanying three coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
each originating from a kinking rope-like structure in the NOAA active region (AR) 12371. These
eruptions were homologous and the surrounding coronal structures remained stationary. Hence we
treated the events as one observed from three diﬀerent viewing angles, and found that the primary
front directly associated with the CME consistently transmits through 1) a polar coronal hole, 2) the
ends of a crescent-shaped equatorial coronal hole, leaving a stationary front outlining its AR-facing
boundary, and 3) two quiescent ﬁlaments, producing slow and diﬀuse secondary fronts. The primary
front also propagates along an arcade of coronal loops and slows down due to foreshortening at the far
side, where local plasma heating is indicated by an enhancement in 211 ˚A (Fe XIV) but a dimming in
193 ˚A (Fe XII) and 171 ˚A (Fe IX). The strength of coronal magnetic ﬁeld is therefore estimated to be
∼ 2 G in the polar coronal hole and ∼ 4 G in the coronal arcade neighboring the active region. These
observations substantiate the wave nature of the primary front and shed new light on slow fronts.

1. INTRODUCTION

Large-scale propagating fronts associated with solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been un-
der intensive study for decades (see Patsourakos & Vourlidas 2012; Liu & Ofman 2014; Warmuth 2015; Chen 2016;
Long et al. 2017, for recent reviews), owing mostly to three generations of space-borne telescopes with ever increas-
ing spatiotemporal resolution in EUV, namely, the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT; Delaboudini`ere et al.
1995) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO; Domingo et al. 1995), the Extreme UltraViolet Imager
(EUVI; Wuelser et al. 2004) onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relationals Observatory (STEREO; Kaiser et al. 2008),
and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO;
Pesnell et al. 2012). Hence they are often referred to as “EIT waves” or “EUV waves”. However, their physical nature
is still under debate, as to whether they are fast MHD waves propagating in the corona or “pseudo waves” generated
by magnetic restructuring associated with an expanding CME. There is evidence for a hybrid picture comprising an
outer, fast-mode MHD wavefront and an inner, CME-associated non-wave front (e.g., Liu & Ofman 2014; Chen 2016).

One of the most convincing arguments for the wave interpretation comes from the evidence for reﬂection and
refraction at regions with strong gradients in Alfv´en and fast-magnetosonic speeds, typically at the boundary of ARs
and coronal holes. It has long been noticed that EUV waves tend to avoid ARs and coronal holes (refraction; e.g.,

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Liu et al.

Thompson et al. 2000). The reﬂection of EUV waves at the coronal hole boundary has been reported in several cases
(Gopalswamy et al. 2009; Li et al. 2012; Olmedo et al. 2012; Shen & Liu 2012; Shen et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2013). The
EUV wave transmission through a coronal hole is relatively rare (Olmedo et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2018). In addition,
Veronig et al. (2006) found that a Moreton wave slides into a coronal hole up to 100 Mm. Similarly, the transmission
of coronal waves into ARs is obscure and rare. The wavefront becomes very faint within ARs, only re-emerging from
the far side (Li et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2013), which is understood by the conservation of wave energy ﬂux. Sometimes
coronal waves reﬂect at ARs (Shen et al. 2013; Kumar & Manoharan 2013). Occasionally, secondary wavefronts are
produced when the primary wavefront impacts on coronal loops (Kumar & Manoharan 2013).

It has long been known that coronal waves can cause the ‘winking’ of ﬁlaments, i.e., a ﬁlament fades or dis-
appears and then re-appears in the Hα line center due to wave-triggered oscillations (e.g., Ramsey & Smith 1966;
Liu et al. 2013). Such oscillations are relatively rare and have much larger amplitude (> 20 km s−1; see the review
by Tripathi et al. 2009) than the frequently observed small-amplitude oscillations (∼ 2 − 3 km s−1; see the review
by Arregui et al. 2012), the latter of which are usually local and seemingly intrinsic. Liu et al. (2012) reported the
transmission of an EUV wave through a coronal cavity with enhanced speed, causing coherent oscillations of ﬁla-
ment threads embedded in the cavity. It is puzzling that a ﬁlament does not always oscillate when a wave passes by
(Okamoto et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2013). Apparently, the ﬁlament’s height and magnetic environment as well as its ori-
entation with respect to the wavefront are signiﬁcant factors deciding how it responds to the wave passage (Liu et al.
2013; Shen et al. 2014b; Zhang et al. 2016).
Investigations on such interactions could yield important insight into
physical properties of both interacting parties (e.g., Gilbert et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2012).

Here we present observations of large-scale EUV fronts associated with a series of halo CMEs originating from
the same AR, NOAA 12371, which are conventionally termed (quasi-)homologous CMEs (Liu et al. 2017; Lugaz et al.
2017). These events provide a precious opportunity to study interactions of the fronts with various coronal structures
from diﬀerent viewing angles, given that the waves are homologous and propagating in similar coronal environments.
The structures impacted by fronts include a polar coronal hole, an equatorial coronal hole, two quiescent ﬁlaments,
and a coronal arcade neighboring to the source AR. In the following text, all the observed propagating fronts are
referred to as wavefronts for simplicity. The detailed analysis of the observations is presented in §2; interpretations
and implications of the observations are discussed and summarized in §3.

2. OBSERVATION & ANALYSIS

AR 12371 produced four halo CMEs during its transit on the solar disk from 2015 June 16–28, each associated
with an M-class ﬂare, a large-scale EUV wave, and a metric Type II radio burst observed by the WAVES instruments
on-board Wind and STEREO spacecrafts (not shown). However, the wave associated with the CME on June 18 failed
to make discernible eﬀects on coronal structures on the disk, while other coronal structures of interest were still behind
the limb. We hence focus on the EUV waves associated with the later three CMEs on 2015 June 21, 22 and 25,
respectively (Figure 1). The June 22 event occurred when AR 12371 was located near the disk center, and hence is
investigated in detail (§2.1). Results from this disk-center event are corroborated by the other two events providing
complementary viewing angles (§2.2 and §2.3).

In the investigations below we mainly used the EUV imaging data obtained by AIA. The instrument takes full-disk
images with a spatial scale of 0.6 arcsec pixel−1 and a cadence of 12 s. Among the 7 EUV and 2 UV passbands, we
focused on four of them: 131 ˚A (primarily Fe XXI for ﬂare plasma, with a peak response temperature log T = 7.05;
Fe VIII for ARs, log T = 5.6), 211 ˚A (Fe XIV, log T = 6.3), 193 ˚A (Fe XXIV for ﬂare plasma, log T = 7.25; Fe XII for
ARs, log T = 6.2) and 171 ˚A (Fe IX, log T = 5.8). The 131 ˚A passband is preferentially used to detect hot eruptive
structures, while the other three passbands are ideal for the detection of EUV wavefronts. The ﬂares were also observed
in hard X-rays (HXRs) by the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin et al. 2002) and
the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The CMEs were observed by the
Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) on-board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO).

Wave Impact on Coronal Structures

2.1.1. Eruption & Wave Initiation

The M6.5-class ﬂare on 2015 June 22 has been studied from various perspectives, e.g., ﬂare precursors on the
surface (Wang et al. 2017a) and in the corona (Awasthi et al. 2018), ﬁne structures and loop slippage during the decay
phase (Jing et al. 2016, 2017). Here we concentrate on the eruption initiation and EUV waves. At about 17:49 UT,
a low-lying hot loop under expansion appeared in AIA 131 ˚A in the center of AR 12371. Starting from about 17:58
UT (Figure 2a), which was close to the 1st time-derivative peak of GOES 1-8 ˚A ﬂux (Figure 1b), the expanding loop
appeared to be increasingly twisted/writhed with time (Figure 2(b–c)), which we term a rope-like structure (RLS).
The RLS corresponds to a complex ﬂux-rope system revealed by nonlinear force-free ﬁeld models (Awasthi et al. 2018).
The overlying coronal loops in AIA 193 ˚A ﬁrst expanded and then contracted (Figure 2(e–g)). In diﬀerence images, an
expanding loop has a bright outer rim and a dark inner rim, while the reverse is true for a contracting loop. Located
right above the RLS, an exemplary loop under contraction is marked by an arrow in Figure 2g.

A virtual slit (marked by a green dashed line in Figure 2g) is placed across the AR loops and the RLS, and a
time-distance map is generated by stacking up the slices taken from images in the chronological order. A northward-
propagating wavefront was detached from the AR loops at about 18:06 UT at 250 km s−1 on the time-distance map
(Figure 2(i–j)). The wavefront can be traced back into the AR via a continuous half-bell-shaped track on the time-
distance map (delineated by a red dashed curve in Figure 2j), with short stripes veering on both sides: loop expansion
(contraction) produces positively (negatively) sloped stripes on the left (right), with comparable speeds of ∼ 50 km s−1.
The coronal loops right above the RLS started to contract at about 18:00 UT. The RLS rose and expanded at 140
km s−1 between about 17:57 and 18:03 UT (Figure 2k). Starting from about 18:12 UT, the time close to the 2nd SXR
peak (Figure 1b), a wavefront emerged with a jet-like feature (marked by an arrow in Figure 2h, see also Figure 2d),
propagated southward, and became diﬀused by 18:23 UT.

2.1.2. Wave Propagation

Unlike the jet-associated wavefront, the primary wavefront propagated mainly in the northwest direction (Fig-
ure 3b). To study the wave propagation, we divided the solar disk into 24 sectors, each spanning 15 deg (Figure 3a)
and centering on the midpoint of the conjugated HXR footpoints at 25–50 keV at 18:04:40 UT (Figure 2g). Each
sector-shaped slice is converted to a 1-dimensional slice by averaging over the azimuthal direction. Stacking up the
slices chronologically yields the time-distance maps in Figure 4. One can see that the jet-associated wavefront is
detected in Sectors 1–4 (labeled ‘JWF’), propagating at about 300 km s−1, while the primary wavefront, which was
initiated earlier, is detected mainly in Sectors 8–17, propagating at a speed exceeding 700 km s−1 to as far as over 800
Mm away from the ﬂaring site.

The wave propagation seems to be modulated by the strength of the local ﬁeld. Here we utilized a potential-
ﬁeld-source-surface (PFSS; Schrijver & De Rosa 2003) model to shed light on this matter. In Figure 3d the starting
points to trace ﬁeld lines are randomly selected on the surface but weighted by magnetic ﬂux so that there are fewer
ﬁeld lines in regions of weaker ﬁeld. One can see that the magnetic ﬁeld is generally weak to the north of AR 12371,
through which the primary wavefront propagated. Another weak-ﬁeld region is located to the immediate south of AR
12371, which may explain the propagation of the jet-associated wavefront in this direction.

Coronal structures that were impacted by the wave include an equatorial coronal hole (CH1), a north polar coronal
hole (CH2; Figure 3(a & d)), and two quiescent ﬁlaments (F1 and F2; Figure 3c). Note the western end of F2 can be
seen above the limb, embedded at the bottom of a coronal cavity (Figure 3a). Below we will investigate in detail the
impact of the EUV wave on the aforementioned coronal structures.

2.1.3. Wave Impact on Coronal Structures

Wave & Coronal Holes — The wave impact on coronal holes can be seen through Sectors 4–8, which cover CH1,
and Sectors 15–17, which cover CH2. In Figure 4, the wave transmission through CH1 is only detected in Sector 8,
which covers the northern end of the crescent-shaped CH1, but not in Sectors 4-7. In contrast, the wave transmission
through CH2 is detected in all sectors across it. Note a stationary front was produced at the AR-facing boundary

4

Liu et al.

of CH1 (labeled ‘SF’ in Figure 6(d–f); see also Figure 4, Sector 8). In addition, a wavefront moving away from CH2
towards the equator can be seen in the polar region above the limb in AIA 193 ˚A running diﬀerence images (see the
animation accompanying Figure 3). It was also detected from the arc slits close to as well as above the limb up to 0.16
R⊙ (∼ 110 Mm), starting at about 18:21 UT at P A ≈ 340 deg with an apparent speed of over 300 km s−1 (labeled
‘RWF’ in Figure 5). It soon became very diﬀuse at P A ≈ 330 deg, before being able to impact F2 at P A ≈ 310. The
wavefront must be either reﬂected oﬀ or refracted out of CH2 since it propagated away from CH2 and appeared later
than the arrival of the primary wavefront (labeled ‘PWF’) at about 18:15 UT.

Wave & Coronal Arcade — The wave transmission through an arcade of coronal loops was most clearly visible in 211 ˚A
(see also the animation accompanying Figure 6), but also marginally visible in 193 ˚A (Sectors 21–23 in Figure 4). This
arcade consists of coronal loops connecting positive ﬂux in the eastern AR and negative ﬂux to the east of AR (Figure 3d
and Figure 6(a–c)). The wavefront appears to propagate along these loops (indicated by red arrows in Figure 6(d–f)),
initially at ∼ 600 km s−1 (Figure 6g), but then signiﬁcantly decelerated to ∼ 50 km s−1 as it propagated toward the
far (eastern) side of the arcade. The wavefront was enhanced in 211 ˚A (Figure 6g) but dimmed in 193 and 171 ˚A
(Figure 6(h and i)), especially when it approached the eastern end of the arcade, where the propagation apparently
stopped.

Wave & Filaments — The wave transmission through the ﬁlaments F1 and F2 is detected in Sectors 10–12 (Figure 4).
There is no discernible change of the primary wavefront as it traversed the ﬁlaments. In addition to the fast and sharp
primary wavefront, one or two secondary wavefronts that are slow and diﬀuse are also visible in the corresponding
time-distance maps. The secondary wavefronts are closely related with the ﬁlament disturbance in response to the
impact of the primary wavefront, but this information is lost in the average over the azimuthal direction in each
sector. We hence constructed time-distance maps (Figure 7) with linear slices across the two ﬁlaments (Figure 3c).
We picked some reference points on the northern edge of the ﬁlaments along the slices (cyan crosses; Figure 3c), each
corresponding to a horizontal reference line in the time-distance map (Figure 7). Note F1’s eastern section bifurcated,
labeled F1a and F1b. Under the impact of the primary wavefront, F1’s displacement as large as 5–10 Mm can be
seen in the time-distance maps southward of the reference line at around y = 110 Mm. F2’s displacement is not quite
visible, due to poorer contrast and more severe foreshortening nearer the limb. With the reference points we found
that secondary wavefronts originated from the northern side of F1 and F2. These wavefronts initiated either from
F1 soon after the impact of the primary wavefront at about 18:15 UT (Linear Slices 4 and 5; Figure 7), or when the
displaced ﬁlament swung back, i.e., after the half period of the oscillation (Linear Slices 1–3). They are very diﬀuse
and hence can be detected in various slits oriented in diﬀerent directions, including the arc-shaped slices (Figure 5(a
& b)). The speed was estimated to range from tens of kilometers per second to about 150 km s−1.

2.2. 2015 June 21 Event

2.2.1. Eruption & Wave Initiation

On 2015 June 21, the halo CME was associated with two successive M-class ﬂares, M2.0 and M3.6 from AR
12371, which peaked in SXRs at 01:42 and 02:36 UT, respectively (Figure 1b). A sigmoidal RLS was observed in
131 ˚A (Figure 8a; see also Lee et al. 2018)) during the rising phase of the M2.0 ﬂare. This structure was apparently
kinked and slightly rotated clockwise as it rose and expanded (Figure 8(b–c)). Meanwhile in 193 ˚A, a bundle of higher
coronal loops in the north ﬁrst expanded and then contracted (Figure 8(e–g)). A representative loop undergoing
contraction is marked by an arrow in Figure 8g. Through a virtual slit starting from the ﬂaring site and oriented in
the expanding direction of the coronal loops (dashed line in Figure 8h), one can see in the resultant time-distance maps
(Figure 8(i–k)) that the deﬂection of coronal loops during 01:37–01:54 UT, i.e., expansion followed by contraction, was
closely associated with the ascent of the RLS at about 110 km s−1. Right after the loop expansion, an EUV (primary)
wavefront was observed to initiate at 01:47 UT at about 140 Mm from the ﬂaring site (Figure 8(i–j)). A wavefront
immediately following the primary one initiated at 02:10 UT at about 170 Mm from the ﬂaring site (Figure 8(i–j)),
which was apparently associated with a jet-like feature (marked by green arrows in Figures 8(i–j) and 9d). Both
wavefronts leave a smooth continuous track on the time-distance maps made from 193 ˚A images.

2.2.2. Wave Propagation & Impact

To study the wave propagation, we again employed 24 sectors to cover the solar disk (Figure 9(a)), each spanning
15 deg and centering on the midpoint of the conjugated HXR footpoints at 25–50 keV at around 01:26:30 UT (not
shown). Three representative sectors are shown in Figure 9(a). The primary wavefront propagated mainly southward
and northward. The southward-propagating wavefront (marked by black arrows in Figure 9(b & c)) transmitted
through CH1 along Sector A (Figure 9d), but not in other angular directions. The wavefront was weak inside CH1, and
a stationary front formed at the AR-facing boundary of CH1, taking a similar crescent shape as CH1 (Figures 9f). The
northward-propagating wavefront transmitted through CH2 along Sector B (Figure 9e). Unlike CH1, the transmission
is seen in various angular directions covering the whole coronal hole, without a stationary front at the boundary. Along
Sector C (Figure 9f), the transmission through the arcade to the east of AR 12371 is only marginally visible due to
its proximity to the limb.

Double or single secondary wavefronts can again be seen through virtual slices across the ﬁlament F1 (Figure 10).
All the secondary wavefronts were associated with the ﬁlament disturbances between 20–40 Mm along the slices (marked
by dotted lines in the top panel of Figure 10) at speeds of no more than 100 km s−1. The ﬁlament disturbances are
better discernible in time-distance maps constructed using original (middle panels) than running diﬀerence images
(bottom panels); the reverse is true for the secondary wavefronts.

2.3. 2015 June 25 Event

At the onset of the M7.9 ﬂare at about 08:10 UT on 2015 June 25, one can see two groups of sheared loops
in 131 ˚A, apparently crossing each other (Fig. 11a). These loops soon evolved into an eruptive RLS, reminiscent of
tether-cutting reconnection Liu et al. (2010). The RLS’ southern leg was apparently kinked (Fig. 11(b & c)). The
primary wavefront emerged at about 08:15 UT, taking a loop shape (Figure 11g). From a virtual slit oriented along
the expulsion direction, one can see that the wave initiation was again associated with the expansion and subsequent
contraction of coronal loops overlying the RLS (Fig. 11(i & j)). A representative 193 ˚A loop under contraction is
marked by an arrow in Fig. 11h. The wave initiation time was around the HXR peak at 50–100 keV at 08:14:28 UT
(Figure 1d).

In this event, the wave impact on coronal structures is best seen for CH2 and the arcade to the east of AR 12371
(Figure 12a). CH1 was located too close to the western limb, despite that a stationary front again formed at its
AR-facing boundary (Figure 12b). The primary wavefront also passed through ﬁlament F1 and produced a secondary
wavefront propagating northward (Figures 12b; see also the animation accompanying Figure 12). With sector-shaped
slices centered on the ﬂaring site, one can see through Sector A that the primary wavefront transmitted through CH2
(Fig. 12(c,d–f)). Though weaker inside CH2 than outside, generally the wavefront was slightly enhanced in 211 ˚A,
signiﬁcantly enhanced in 193 ˚A, but dimmed in 171 ˚A, suggesting that the plasma at the wavefront was warmed up to
about 1.5 MK, an eﬀect not clearly seen in the other two events. Sector B highlights the wavefront propagation along
the arcade of coronal loops to the east of AR 12371, with an apparent deceleration (Figure 12(g–i)). The wavefront was
initially shown as an enhanced feature in 211 and 193 ˚A, but not quite visible in 171 ˚A. However, when approaching
the far side of the arcade, the wavefront was transformed into a dimmed feature in 171 and 193 ˚A, while remained
enhanced in 211 ˚A, suggesting that the plasma at the wavefront was warmed up to about 2 MK, similar to the June
22 event (Figure 6(g–i)).

3. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION

3.1. Homologousness of the Events

AR 12371 dominated the northern hemisphere during its disk transit. During the same period AR 12367 was
the only major active region in the southern hemisphere; it was far away from AR 12371 and already close to the
western limb on 2015 June 21 (c.f. Figure 9(a & c)). Thus the EUV waves under investigation were propagating in
similar coronal environments, interacting with similar coronal structures. This allows us to study these interactions
from diﬀerent viewing angles. On the other hand, the waves also derive their similarities from the homologousness of

6

Liu et al.

the eruptions, which are elaborated below from three aspects.

First, the eruptions produced CMEs with similar morphology. All three CMEs exhibit a two-front morphology
(Vourlidas et al. 2013): a halo outer front followed by an inner front with a more limited angular width (Figure 1(d–f)).
The former is likely to be caused by the density compression at the primary wavefront, while the latter is identiﬁed
with the RLS observed in the low corona, judging by its expulsion direction and spatial extent. Whether or not
the wavefront is driven by the CME is debatable because of the asymmetry between the CME front with a limited
angular width and the halo shocked front. Howard & Pizzo (2016) argued that the asymmetry could be explained by
a blast wave and a ﬂux rope erupting together. The contrast between a halo wavefront in the extended corona and
a much narrower EUV wavefront on the surface suggests that the wave propagates in all directions in the relatively
homogeneous high corona but is conﬁned in the “valleys” of low Alf´ven speed in the highly inhomogeneous low corona.

Second, the eruptions originate from the same segment of the AR’s polarity inversion line, shared similar eruptive
structure, and exhibited similar dynamics in the active region. The RLS in each event appeared to be kinked before
erupting into higher corona (Figures 2, 8, 11), hence we interpret it as a magnetic ﬂux rope. The writhing motion
indicates that the rope’s magnetic twist has reached the threshold of the helical kink instability (Gilbert et al. 2007).
The increase in twist can be accomplished by reconnections during the early phase of the ﬂare (e.g., Wang et al. 2017b).
Moreover, when the kinking RLS ascended, the overlying loops deﬂected, i.e., ﬁrst expanded and then contracted
(Figures 2, 8, and 11). A similar phenomenon was reported when a kinking ﬁlament ‘squeezed’ through the overlying
arcade (Liu & Wang 2009). Alternatively, the loop deﬂection is expected with the passage of a compressive wavefront
followed by a rarefaction in pressure. This might be true in the June 22 and 25 events, in which the wavefront track in
the time-distance map passes apparently through the ‘watershed’ between loop expansion and contraction (Figures 2
& 11), but is not the case in the June 21 event (Figure 8). Hence we lean toward the former scenario.

Third, all three events show two major peaks in SXR or its time derivative, indicating two episodes of energy
release (Figure 1(a–c)). In the June 21 and 22 events we did ﬁnd two wavefronts: the primary wavefront was detected
during the earlier episode of energy release; a narrower, jet-associated wavefront during the later episode (Figures 2
and 8, and accompany animations). In the June 25 event, only the primary wavefront was detected; a 2nd wave front,
even if existed, could be easily missed because the 2nd SXR peak is weaker compared with the other two ﬂares, and
the active region was close to the limb by that time.

3.2. Wave Interaction with Coronal Structures

The transmission of the primary wavefront through the bulk of the polar coronal hole CH2 was consistently
observed on 2015 June 21 (Figures 9e), 22 (Figure 4(Sectors 15–17)) and 25 (Figure 12(d–f)), with CH2 being im-
aged from quite diﬀerent viewing angles, which minimizes the possibility of false detection. On the other hand, the
transmission through the equatorial coronal hole CH1 was only seen at its southern end on June 21 (Figure 9d) and
northern end on June 22 (Figure 4; Sector 8). We noticed that a bright stationary front formed at the AR-facing
boundary of CH1 (Figures 6, 9 and 12), sustaining for an extended time period in each case. Hence we speculate
that the primary wavefront only transmitted through the ends of CH1 because the bulk of wave energy was dissipated
at the stationary front. Such stationary fronts also appear in numerical experiments when a fast-mode wave passes
a coronal hole (e.g., Piantschitsch et al. 2017, 2018) or a quasi-separatrix layer (Chen et al. 2016). On 2015 June 22,
a reﬂected/refracted front was seen to move away from the polar coronal hole at projected heights up to ∼ 110 Mm
above the limb (Figure 5). We note that a similar height (∼ 80–100 Mm) was obtained for EUV waves using STEREO
quadrature observations (Patsourakos et al. 2009; Kienreich et al. 2009).

The propagation of the primary wavefront along a coronal arcade consisting of east-west oriented loops was
consistently observed in all three events (Figures 6, 9f, and 12(g–i)). When we had a clear view of the whole arcade
(June 22 and 25), we found the propagation speed was signiﬁcantly decelerated as the wavefront propagated at the
far-side of the arcade (Figures 6(g–i) and 12(g–i)); but when the arcade was located close to the east limb (June 21), its
far side was obscured by the perspective, and we found no clear deceleration (Figure 9f). Hence the deceleration was
most likely a foreshortening eﬀect involving the arched geometry and viewing angles. While the wavefront apparently
slowed, it was enhanced in 211 ˚A and dimmed in 193 and 171 ˚A. We speculate that the arcade serves as a lens that
‘focuses’ the waves toward the far end of the arcade, resulting in a local heating as evidenced by the diﬀerent responses

in 211 (Fe XIV), 193 (Fe XII), and 171 ˚A (Fe IX).

Under the impact of the primary wavefront from the south, the northward displacement of the ﬁlaments was
negligible compared to the southward displacement (Figures 7 and 10). This can be understood by the Alfv´en speed
increasing with height in the low corona (below about 3 R⊙) of the quiet Sun (Gopalswamy et al. 2001). As a result,
fast magnetosonic wavefront tends to be refracted toward the surface, consequently inclining forward, which was indeed
observed in some limb events (e.g., Hudson et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2012) and reproduced by numerical simulations (e.g.,
Wu et al. 2001; Grechnev et al. 2011). Upon arriving at a ﬁlament suspended in corona, the compressive wavefront
would push the ﬁlament down forward due to the oblique front. The resultant displacement is expected to be small
partly because of increasing magnetic ﬁeld and plasma density toward the surface, and partly because of projection
eﬀects with the ﬁlament being located in the northern hemisphere. The ﬁlament then swings back and is expected
to overshoot because of the rarefaction in the wake of the compressive wavefront, therefore displaying a signiﬁcant
southward displacement. The 2nd swing of the ﬁlament towards its original position would again exert pressure
on the surface. Such impacts may produce the northward-propagating secondary wavefronts. These wavefronts are
very diﬀuse probably because they originate at diﬀerent times from diﬀerent places along the ﬁlament. With speeds
comparable to the sound speed, these secondary wavefronts are likely slow-mode waves.

3.3. Nature of the Primary Wavefront

The magnetic ﬁeld in the polar coronal hole is open and hence predominantly vertical to the wave propagation,
while in the coronal arcade the magnetic ﬁeld is traced by coronal loops and hence parallel to the wave propagation.
This reveals the nature of the primary wavefront, since only fast magnetosonic waves can propagate in all directions
with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld. On the other hand, the stationary front at the boundary of the equatorial coronal
hole makes it unlikely to interpret the primary wavefront as a slow-mode soliton (Wills-Davey et al. 2007; Long et al.
2017). Although compatible with the stationary front, both the current shell model (Delann´ee et al. 2007, 2008)
and the continuous reconnection model (Attrill et al. 2007) cannot accommodate the transmission through, and the
reﬂection/refraction from, the polar coronal hole (Long et al. 2017). The fast-mode shock wave in the ﬁeld-line
stretching model (Chen et al. 2002, 2005) is consistent with the primary wavefront in our observations, but it would
be diﬃcult for this model to explain why a slower front appeared only when the primary front impacted the ﬁlaments,
had the slower front resulted from the stretching of ﬁeld lines overlying the erupting ﬂux rope.

The 2015 June 25 event is optimal for observing the transmission of the primary wavefront through the polar
coronal hole and the coronal arcade (Figure 12a), as both structures were close to the disk center. Given that the
wave propagates at the fast-magnetosonic speed, in the coronal hole the speed is

4πnmp is the Alfv´en speed, and cs =

where vA = B/
γkBT /mp is the sound speed. These speeds are insensitive
to plasma temperature and density because of the square root. We made a rough estimate of the magnetic ﬁeld
strength by adopting typical values of plasma density number in the corona, i.e., n ∼ 108 cm−3 for the coronal hole
and 109 cm−3 for the coronal arcade. We further assumed that the plasma temperature is in the range of 1–2 MK in
the quiet Sun, and that the adiabatic index γ = 5/3. With the wave propagation speeds measured in the time-distance
maps (Figures 12(d & g)), we found that B ∼ 2 G and plasma β ∼ 0.2–0.3 in the coronal hole, and that B ∼ 4 G and
β ∼ 0.5–1 in the coronal arcade neighboring the active region. These numbers are comparable with previous results
obtained by various methods (Liu & Ofman 2014, and references therein).

3.4. Summary

We have analyzed the coronal EUV waves associated with the three CMEs on 2015 June 21, 22 and 25, respectively.
These homologous eruptions provide us a rare opportunity to investigate how the waves interact with coronal structures
from three diﬀerent viewing angles. Such observations help resolve the ambiguity and confusion due to projection and
perspective eﬀects, and yield new insight into the physics of EUV waves, as being highlighted below.

Liu et al.

• The propagation both along the ﬁeld in the coronal arcade and across the ﬁeld in the coronal holes substan-
tiates the primary wavefront as fast magnetoacoustic waves. The wave nature is further corroborated by the
reﬂected/refracted wavefront bent away from the polar coronal hole.

• As the primary wavefront propagates along a coronal arcade toward its far end, a slow front is seen to ‘veer oﬀ’
from the fast front in the time-distance maps (Figures 6 and 12). This is an eﬀect of perspective and projection,
which we suspect might be responsible for some of the slow fronts exhibiting similar features in time-distance
maps (e.g., Chen & Wu 2011; Asai et al. 2012; Xue et al. 2013; Shen et al. 2014a). This oﬀers an alternative
scenario to those interpreting the slow front as a pseudo-wave produced by coronal restructuring associated with
CMEs (e.g., Delann´ee et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2005; Attrill et al. 2007).

• Slow and diﬀuse wavefronts are produced by the primary wavefronts impacting on ﬁlaments, which may account

for some extremely slow and diﬀuse “EIT” waves (e.g., Warmuth & Mann 2011).

Figure 8. Initiation of the eruption in AR 12371 on 2015 June 21. (a–d) A rope-like structure (RLS) in running diﬀerence 131 ˚A
images. (e–h) Coronal loops overlying the RLS in running diﬀerence 193 ˚A images. The arrow in (g) marks a representative
loop undergoing contraction. Panels (i–k) show the dynamics seen through the virtual slit in (h), using original 193 ˚A images,
running diﬀerence 193 ˚A and 131 ˚A images, respectively. The dashed line ﬁtting the rising RLS in (k) is replotted in (i). In (i
and j), the white arrows mark the two successive wavefronts, whose initiating time and location along the slit are marked by
red asterisks; the green arrow marks a jet-like feature (see also Figure 9d). An animation of 131 and 193 ˚A running diﬀerence
images is available online.

Figure 9. Wave propagation in the 2015 June 21 event. Panel (a) shows three representative sector-shaped slices (labeled A,
B, and C). Yellow dashed circles indicate the distance from the sector center, i.e., the ﬂaring site, with numbers in units of
Mm. Panels (b & c) highlight in 211 ˚A diﬀerence images the southward-propagating wavefront (black arrows), the secondary
wavefronts produced at the ﬁlament F1 (red arrows), and the stationary front (labeled SF) at the eastern boundary of CH1.
Time-distance maps constructed via the sector-shaped slices in (a) show the wave transmission through CH1 (d) and CH2 (e),
and wave propagation along the arcade neighboring the active region (f). An animation of 211 and 193 ˚A running diﬀerence
images is available online.
