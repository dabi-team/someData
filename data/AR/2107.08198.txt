ABSTRACT

Despite studying Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) for several years, we are yet to have a complete
understanding of their kinematics.
In this regard, the change in kinematics of the CMEs, as they
travel from the inner corona (< 3R(cid:12)) to the higher heights is essential. We do a follow up statistical
study of several 3D kinematic parameters of 59 CMEs studied by Majumdar et al. (2020). The source
regions of these CMEs are identiﬁed and classiﬁed as Active Regions (ARs), Active Prominences
(APs), and Prominence Eruptions (PEs). We study several statistical correlations between diﬀerent
kinematic parameters of the CMEs. We show that the average kinematic parameters change as they
propagate from the inner to the outer corona, indicating the importance of the region where normally
the common practice is to perform averaging. We also ﬁnd that the parameters in the outer corona is
highly inﬂuenced by those in the inner corona, thus indicating the importance of inner corona in the
understanding of the kinematics. We further ﬁnd that the source regions of the CMEs tend to have
a distinct imprint on the statistical correlations between diﬀerent kinematic parameters, and that an
overall correlation tends to wash away this crucial information. The results of this work lends support
towards possibly diﬀerent dynamical classes for the CMEs from active regions and prominences which
is manifested in their kinematics.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large scale eruption of plasma and magnetic ﬁeld from the solar corona into
the heliosphere (Webb & Howard 2012). Their speed ranges from a few hundreds to a few thousands of km s−1, and
acceleration ranging from few tens to a few 104 m s−2 (for a review, see Webb & Howard 2012). CMEs are also the
major drivers of space weather, as they are capable of producing shock waves, interplanetary disturbances, causing
huge technological damages (Gosling 1993). Thus, they are of interest from both scientiﬁc and technological point of
views, and hence a good understanding of their kinematics is essential. It is understood that the kinematics of CMEs
are governed by the interplay of three forces, namely the Lorentz force, the gravitational force and the viscous drag
force (Wood et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2001; Webb & Howard 2012; Vrˇsnak et al. 2007). As a result of these forces,
CMEs follow a three phase kinematic proﬁle. According to Zhang & Dere (2006), the ﬁrst, initial phase is a slow rise
phase, followed by an impulsive acceleration phase (observed as rapid increase in their velocity) and then the ﬁnal
phase where the CMEs propagate with little or no acceleration. In this regard, the ﬁrst two phases are usually over
in the low coronal heights (< 3R(cid:12)) (Temmer et al. 2008; Bein et al. 2011; Patel et al. 2021). At later stages of their
evolution, CMEs experience drag due to solar wind resulting in the deceleration (Gopalswamy et al. 2000; Moon et al.

2002; Webb & Howard 2012). So as kinematics of CMEs change from inner to outer corona, averaging of the diﬀerent
kinematic parameters over their entire trajectory might lead to washing away of a lot of crucial information that might
hold clue to the coupling of kinematics of CMEs in the inner corona, to the heliosphere.

CMEs are also known to be associated with diﬀerent source regions, Active Regions (ARs) and Prominence Eruptions
(PEs) (Subramanian & Dere 2001; Moon et al. 2002; Majumdar et al. 2020). CMEs associated with ARs are known
to be mostly impulsive whereas the ones associated with PEs are gradual CMEs (MacQueen & Fisher 1983; Sheeley
et al. 1999). Recently Pant et al. (2021) reported the inﬂuence of diﬀerent source regions on the width distribution of
CMEs. Now, whether these diﬀerent source regions have any clear imprint on diﬀerent kinematic properties of CMEs
is still not known clearly.

A major concern in the study of CME kinematics is regarding the measurements that are carried out in the plane
of the sky, thus leading to projection eﬀects in the measured quantities (Balmaceda et al. 2018). A primary step to
minimise such projection eﬀects, is to connect the CMEs to their source regions on the disk of the Sun. An even better
way to remove the projection eﬀects is to use 3D reconstruction techniques. In this regard, several works based on the
tracking of CMEs in 3D have been reported (Thernisien et al. 2006; Mierla et al. 2008; Thernisien et al. 2009; Moran
et al. 2010; Joshi & Srivastava 2011; Sarkar et al. 2019). A method based on forward modelling to ﬁt the CME ﬂux
rope on multi-vantage-point images was also developed assuming the self-similar expansion of CMEs (Thernisien et al.
2006, 2009), which was termed as the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model. Thus a study based on the ﬁtted
parameters of the model will be free from projection eﬀects. Recently, Majumdar et al. (2020) connected 3D proﬁles
of width evolution and acceleration to report on the observational evidence of the imprint of the height of inﬂuence
of Lorentz force on the 3D kinematics. One of the most signiﬁcant relevance of these 3D parameters is in the context
of arrival time prediction of CMEs. Several models have been developed that takes the average speed of the CME as
input to predict their arrival times (for a review see Zhao & Dryer 2014; Riley et al. 2018).

Since the kinematics of the CMEs change as they propagate outwards, it is important to look at the coupling of the
kinematics of the CMEs from the inner to the outer corona. As it is already reported several times in the past that
quiescent prominences and active regions tend to classify the ejected CMEs from them into two dynamical classes,
with the former tending to be gradual CMEs while the later being impulsive CMEs (Sheeley et al. 1999), it is worth
looking at the manifestation of this distinction in the behaviour of diﬀerent kinematic parameters that reﬂect the
kinematics of a CME. In this work, keeping in mind the above existing shortcomings in our understanding of CME
kinematics, we try look into the correlation between diﬀerent 3D kinematic parameters of the CMEs as they evolve
from the inner to the outer corona. With the additional information of the source region of the CMEs, we also look
into the imprint of the source regions (if any) on the behaviour of these diﬀerent 3D kinematic parameters. We study
the same 59 events as studied by Majumdar et al. (2020) and follow the same analysis. In this context, it should be
noted that a shock spheroid model is also available as a part of the GCS model (as reported earlier by Hess & Zhang
(2014)) for ﬁtting the shock front ahead of the ﬂux-rope. Since we were not interested in the shock dynamics and our
aim was focused on the CME kinematics, we used only the ﬂux-rope GCS model in our work. Alike Majumdar et al.
(2020), two vantage point observations are used for ﬁtting the GCS model. It must be noted that provision for the
use of a third vantage point in the form of observations from Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO;
Brueckner et al. 1995) on-board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) can be used for better constraining
parameters like the tilt-angle (see Thernisien et al. 2009). Since the aim of this work was to study the radial kinematics
of CMEs, hence the tilt-angle parameter was not used in our analysis, thus reducing the need for the third vantage
point. Also, the ﬁeld of view of LASCO starts well beyond the starting FOV of COR-1, and since we don’t want to
include Extreme Ultraviolet observations with white light, in order to keep consistency, we did not include LASCO
observations for the GCS ﬁtting. In section 2 we outline the data source used and the working method, followed by
our results in section 3 and we summarize the main conclusions from our work in section 4

2.2. Parameter description

To understand the relationship between the diﬀerent parameters associated with kinematics of CME as the CME
propagates from the inner to the outer corona, we list out the diﬀerent parameters used in this work in Table 1 and
deﬁne them as follows.

• amax (Vmax) - peak acceleration (velocity) of the CME in the entire (COR-1 and COR-2) ﬁeld of view (FOV)

• Vamax - Velocity of the CME at amax

• Vlin - average velocity of the CME from linear ﬁt to the height-time data for the entire FOV

• Vmi (ami) - mean velocity (acceleration) in the inner corona (< 3 R(cid:12)) computed by taking the mean of the

velocity (acceleration)-time data points obtained from derivatives of the height-time data

• am (Vm) - Overall mean acceleration (velocity) in the entire FOV by computing the mean of the acceleration

(velocity)-time data points obtained from derivatives of the height-time data

• aconst - constant acceleration in the entire FOV, found from quadratic ﬁt to the height-time data for the entire

FOV.

• hamax (hvmax) - height at which peak acceleration (velocity) was attained

3. RESULTS

We derived the parameters mentioned in Section 2.2 from the velocity and acceleration calculations of the 59 CMEs
described in Majumdar et al. (2020), studied their correlations and established several empirical relations amongst
them. In this regard, some of the CMEs studied in Majumdar et al. (2020) show deceleration very close to the Sun
(see Figure 2 of Majumdar et al. 2020). It should be noted that we have used coronagraph images with a FOV starting
from 1.4 R(cid:12) (in the plane of sky) and in some cases the CMEs have already reached 2 R(cid:12) (projected height) for the
ﬁrst measurement. According to Gui et al. (2011), the impulsiveness of the CMEs occurs below 1.5 R(cid:12). As the above
mentioned CMEs are well beyond this height for the initial points of measurement, it is possible to have deceleration
at the start of the coronagraph FOV. Further, in this regard, Sachdeva et al. (2017) had reported that for fast CMEs,
solar wind drag can act earlier, leading to the deceleration. It should also be noted that the widths mentioned in Table
1 of Majumdar et al. (2020) is the value of the half-angle parameter measured at a particular instant of time and height
(as mentioned in the table), beyond which the parameter experiences further evolution. Further, while comparing the
GCS width with the width given in the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) catalogue (Gopalswamy et al.
2009), it must be kept in mind that the complete width of the CME as measured from the GCS model is estimated
as 2(half angle + Sin−1(aspect ratio)), while CDAW provides the ﬁnal projected width, and for halo or partial-halo
CMEs, the projected width becomes an over-estimate. In Table 1 of this work, we provide the Pearson’s correlation
coeﬃcient (CC) and for better appreciation of our results, the Pearson’s critical correlation coeﬃcients (CCCs). We
also provide the associated p-value which shows the statistical signiﬁcance of the correlation. The average signiﬁcance
level (α) for the correlations was found to be 0.05 on average, thus correlations with p-values lesser than 0.05 and CCs
higher than CCCs implies statistically signiﬁcant result. In Figure 1(a) We plot amax versus Vmax. We ﬁnd that the
two parameters are positively correlated with a CC of 0.63 and can be described by the following relation:

A similar result was also reported by Bein et al. (2011) but it must be noted that their numbers suﬀered from projection
eﬀects and their numbers were obtained by combining Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and White Light (WL) observations
which brings in an additional ambiguity of whether the same physical feature is being tracked in EUV and WL (for a
discussion, see Song et al. 2019, and references therein), as the former corresponds to the temperature structure of a

CME while the later corresponds to the density structure (Ying et al. 2020). In our work, we do away with both of
these limitations, as our measured numbers are in 3D and the measurements are done uniquely in WL. Thus, we ﬁnd
that the power law remains unchanged in 3D. Since we also have the information of the source regions of the CMEs,
we further ﬁnd the correlation between these quantities, separately for CMEs coming from diﬀerent source regions.
From this, we ﬁnd that amax and Vmax are strongly correlated (CC = 0.91) for CMEs coming from ARs, while the
ones coming from APs and PEs show weaker correlations of 45% and 41% respectively. This thus indicates at the
diﬀerence in the CCs for CMEs connected to ARs and CMEs connected to prominences (APs and PEs). We also ﬁnd
that the the two quantities for CMEs from ARs are now related by the relation,

amax = 10−2.71 V1.98
max.

(2)

Thus, besides arriving at a similar conclusion in 3D as was reported earlier by Bein et al. (2011) in 2D, with the aid
of the source region information, we now understand that the source regions have a distinct imprint on the correlation
between these parameters, and concluding based on just the overall correlation washes away this crucial information.
For a better understanding, we also plot in Figure 1(b) Vamax versus amax. In this case too we ﬁnd an overall positive
correlation of 0.57. This positive correlation can be described by the relation,

Vamax = 101.30 a0.43
max.

(3)

A similar behaviour was also reported by Joshi & Srivastava (2011) based on fewer samples, although no such power
law relation (or any CC) was reported by them. Further looking into the CCs for CMEs coming from diﬀerent sources,
we ﬁnd that the ones coming from ARs show a relatively higher correlation with a CC of 0.77 , while it is lesser for
those coming from APs and PEs (with CC of 0.42 and 0.57 respectively). Thus once again (in support of our previous
result) hinting towards the fact that possibly the dynamics of the CMEs connected to ARs are diﬀerent from those
which are connected to prominences.

Majumdar et al.

The CMEs from ARs have a CC of 0.63, while the CMEs connected to prominence eruptions (that is APs or
PEs) have a higher correlation of 0.78. This indirectly indicates that such CMEs connected to erupting prominences,
experience a small and gradual acceleration that continues during their propagation in the higher heights, while the
ones from ARs are more prone to an initial impulsive acceleration followed by a decelerating or constant velocity proﬁle
from thereon. Although this was reported in earlier works (Sheeley et al. 1999; Moon et al. 2002; Webb & Howard
2012), it is important to note that this result is based on 3D quantities, and with the relative contribution of diﬀerent
source regions to the overall correlation. Also, from our results we show that similar conclusions (which are well known
from previous studies as mentioned above) on the kinematics of gradual and impulsive CMEs can also be obtained
from a diﬀerent perspective by studying the statistical kinematic properties.

Figure 2(a) also projects the importance of considering the kinematics in the inner corona, and how the kinematic
parameters in the outer corona is inﬂuenced by those in the inner corona. Also, several models of CME arrival time
predictions, use Vlin as input to calculate their arrival times (for a review see Zhao & Dryer 2014; Riley et al. 2018).
An important aspect in this regard is the lead time of forecast, which is the diﬀerence between the observed arrival
time of CME, and the time of submission of the forecast (Riley et al. 2018). With the help of equation 4, the lead
time can be minimised, by estimating Vlin from Vmi, thereby reducing the absolute dependency on outer corona
observations for arrival time predictions. Please note that an estimate of the gain in lead time would be possible
only with the availability of near-real time data. Apart from that, it will also depend on the telemetry rate of the
instruments involved, as that would dictate the accessibility of the near real time data. Having said that, we would
also like to emphasize that our result will help in the implementation of inner coronal observations from space missions
like ADITYA-L1 (Seetha & Megala 2017; Prasad et al. 2017) and PROBA-3 (Renotte et al. 2014) (which do not have
outer coronal observations) solely for the purpose of arrival time estimation of CMEs.

In Figure 2(b), we plot Vmax versus Vm and ﬁnd that the two quantities are positively correlated, with an overall

CC of 0.73, and they can be related by the relation,

Vmax = 101.05 V0.72
m .

(5)

This throws light on the kind of acceleration proﬁles, the CMEs experienced. The ones experiencing impulsive
acceleration also experience a high retardation (see Figure 2 in Majumdar et al. 2020) which will largely aﬀect Vm,
while the ones experiencing uniform acceleration do not experience such high retardation. Again, looking at the source
region contributions, we see that the ones from ARs have a comparatively lower CC of 0.67, and similar value for the
ones from PEs, while the CMEs from APs shows a higher CC of 0.88. This thus re-establishes that CMEs connected
to ARs are mostly impulsive ones and experience higher deceleration than those connected to APs, which is leading
to a lower correlation in the former. A lower correlation in the case of CMEs from PEs again point that they are
gradual events where a steady small acceleration prevents the mean velocity to correlate more strongly with the peak
velocity (as the later keeps on increasing). It is important to note that this was also pointed out by Majumdar et al.
(2020), and thus we re-aﬃrm those results in a more statistical manner here. The above relation (Equation 5) could
also be empirically used to estimate one of the quantities when the other is known. For example, if we have inner
corona observations in the future from Aditya-L1/VELC and STEREO/COR-1A, then Vmax could be measured in
inner corona from which the mean speed (Vm) could be estimated based on such empirical relation quickly. Vm has
further diﬀerent applications such as in drag based models for CME propagation.

We look into the correlation between aconst and Vmi in Figure 3(a). We ﬁnd a clear anti-correlation between the two

quantities with a CC of -0.67, where the two quantities are related by

.

mi

aconst = 545.6 V−0.52
This indicates at the interaction of the CME and the solar wind and hence the drag experienced by the former due
to the later. It is worthwhile to note that such acceleration velocity anti-correlation has been reported earlier (see
Moon et al. 2002; Vrˇsnak et al. 2004), but such reports only include results in the outer corona and with projected
values of acceleration and velocities (starting with projected height of at least 2 R(cid:12)). In our work, we report on a
similar anti-correlation that exists in the inner corona as well, and our result is based on 3D acceleration and velocity.
This anti-correlation thus shows that the inﬂuence of the drag forces comes into play as early as in the inner corona.
Further, on looking into the individual source region contributions, we ﬁnd that the CMEs from ARs have a CC of
-0.61, and a similar correlation (-0.62) for CMEs from APs, while this anti-correlation is relatively poor for PEs (-0.30).
This distinct diﬀerence in the CC for CMEs from PEs and CMEs from active regions (ARs and APs) points to the

coded according to the source regions.

contrasting acceleration experienced by the CMEs. CMEs with impulsive acceleration are faster, which increases the
drag, and hence a higher retardation which is reﬂected in the higher value of anti-correlation in the case of CMEs
connected to ARs. This is not the case for CMEs from PEs which are predominantly gradual events, and hence a
weaker anti-correlation reﬂecting a weaker drag experienced. Thus we again ﬁnd the importance of the source region
information in the study of statistical kinematics of CMEs.

In Figure 4(a) we plot the distribution of Vmi and Vm. We ﬁnd that the distribution of Vm has been shifted towards
the right side with respect to the distribution of Vmi. Thus, for average quantities, it is important to specify the
region where the average has been taken, as we can see that the numbers change from the inner to the outer corona.
For a better illustration, in Figure 4(b) we plot Vm versus Vmi. The solid line represents the boundary where both
the quantities are equal. We see that for most of the CMEs, Vm is greater than Vmi implying that the CMEs have
gained speed while propagating in the outer corona. We also note that for CMEs which have Vmi greater than Vm,
most of them are from ARs, thus re-indicating the presence of impulsive accelerations in the lower heights, followed by
deceleration later. Also, the CMEs coming from PEs have Vm greater than Vmi, thus conﬁrming that they experience
gradual acceleration for a longer duration that lead to a steady increase in their velocities as they propagate outwards.
So, we note that working with a single average velocity of the CME for its entire trajectory, often masks this important
information. Similarly, in Figure 4(c) we plot the distribution of ami and am. We ﬁnd that the distribution of ami was
relatively more spread out around the zero value, thus indicating acceleration and deceleration and hence the wide
range of kinematics exhibited by CMEs connected to diﬀerent source regions, while the distribution of am is more
narrowed around the zero value with the mode of the distribution lying in the range of 0-100 m s−2. Thus showing
that the CMEs experience very little acceleration in their higher heights. For a better understanding, in Figure 4(d)
we plot the distribution of hamax and hvmax.
In support to our former argument on Figure 4(c), here too we see
that the distribution of hamax is not as spread out as the distribution of hvmax. We also see that the mode of the
distribution of hamax lies at 2-3 R(cid:12), which is also supported by the results of Majumdar et al. (2020) on the fact that
the impact of Lorentz force on the 3D kinematics of CMEs stays dominant till a height range of 2.5-3 R(cid:12). Thus,
this result also points to the fact that it is also the Lorentz force that is closely responsible for the CMEs attaining
their peak accelerations during their propagation. While looking into the distribution of hvmax, we ﬁnd that we do
not get to see any such clear peak in the distribution, and that it is much more spread out. This is possibly because
we have selected events from three diﬀerent classes, CMEs from ARs which show presence of impulsive acceleration

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the behaviour of several 3D kinematic parameters of the 59 CMEs studied by Majumdar et al.
(2020) and we extended their analysis in this work. Several correlations studied between diﬀerent kinematic parameters
showed the importance of considering inner corona observations in the understanding of CME kinematics, and how
diﬀerent kinematic parameters in the outer corona are inﬂuenced by the parameters in the inner corona. We also

found that the overall correlations often washes away crucial information and individual correlations for CMEs from
diﬀerent source regions show the imprint of source regions on the kinematics. In this regard, the change in the power
law exponent for the diﬀerent CCs is not much pronounced which has led to a considerable overlapping of the data
points for diﬀerent source regions. Recently, Pant et al. (2021) reported on the clear inﬂuence of the source region on
the width distribution of slow and fast CMEs, concluding on the possibility of diﬀerent physical ejection mechanisms
for the CMEs from ARs and PEs. In this work, we thus look into the correlations of several kinematic parameters,
and we again ﬁnd a clear imprint of the source regions (in the form of distinctly diﬀerent individual CCs) on the
overall correlations. Further, we ﬁnd that while working with average kinematic quantities, it is important to specify
the region where the average is taken, as the average values change with the CME propagating from the inner to the
outer corona. It should also be noted that even within the inner corona, the average values change, and in this work,
we pointed out this, that tagging a single average speed to a CME might not be the best way to comment on its speed
and hence we show as an example that the average speed of a CME indeed changes as the CME travels from the inner
to the outer corona. It is also worth noting that our results are based on 3D parameters and are hence independent
of projection eﬀects. In the following, we conclude our main results,

• A study of amax and Vmax revealed that the two quantities are positively correlated with a CC of 0.63. The
CC is signiﬁcantly higher (0.91) for CMEs from ARs as compared to the ones from APs and PEs. A study of
amax and Vamax further showed that despite a moderate overall correlation, the ones coming from ARs show a
much higher positive correlation (CC 0.77), indicating that the maximum velocity and accelerations are better
correlated for CMEs from ARs.

• We found Vlin and vmi to be positively correlated (CC 0.68), and that the former can be estimated from the later
through equation 4, thus enabling the use of inner coronal observations to CME arrival time predictions with
better lead time of forecast. Further a study of Vmax and vm indicated indirectly at the acceleration experienced
by the CMEs from diﬀerent source regions.

• We also found an anti-correlation between aconst and Vmi with a CC of -0.67 that shows evidence of the drag
experienced by the CME due to interaction with the solar wind. Thus showing that the inﬂuence of the drag
forces comes into play as early as in the inner corona. While, the CMEs from ARs and APs have similar CCs,
for PEs, the correlation is much weaker with a CC of -0.30.

• From Figure 4(a) and (b), we found the average velocities change as the CMEs travel from the inner to the
outer corona, and that the CMEs from PEs experience weak and gradual accelerations, while the ones from ARs
experience impulsive accelerations followed by retardation. This was further supported by Figure 4(c) which
showed that am is more conﬁned around the zero value while ami is relatively more spread about the zero value.
Also, we found the distribution of hamax peaks around 2 − 3 R(cid:12), which supports the results of Majumdar et al.
(2020) on the fact that the impact of Lorentz force stays dominant in 2.5-3 R(cid:12). Thus indicating the role of
Lorentz force in propelling the CMEs to their peak accelerations.

A number of upcoming space missions like ADITYA-L1, PROBA-3 and the recently launched Solar Orbiter (M¨uller
et al. 2013) will be observing the inner corona, and we believe these results will provide rich inputs to their observation
plans. Also, the above correlations correlating the parameters in the inner corona to the parameters in the outer
corona will help in better exploiting the inner coronal observations. Further extending this study over a larger sample
size, will help in better establishing our claims. The results will also provide inputs to models that study CME ejection
mechanisms, thus aiding in our present understanding of the same.
