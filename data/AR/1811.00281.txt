Abstract

Employing the high spatio-temporal Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph 1330 ˚A observa-

tions, we investigated the jet-like features that occurred during the X8.2 class ﬂare in NOAA

active region (AR) 12673 on 2017 September 10. These jet-like features were rooted in the

ﬂare ribbons. We examined 15 features, and the mean values of the lifetimes, projected widths,

lengths and velocities of these features were 87 s, 890 km, 2.7 Mm and 70 km s−1, respec-

tively. We also observed many jet-like features which happened during the X1.0 class ﬂare on

2014 October 25. We studied the spectra at the base of a jet-like feature during its develop-

ment. The Fe XXI 1354.08 ˚A line in the corona displays blueshift, while the Si IV 1402.77 ˚A

line in the transition region exhibits redshift, which indicates the chromospheric evaporation.

This is the ﬁrst time that the jet-like features are reported to be rooted in the ﬂare ribbons,

and we suggest that these jet-like features were driven by the mechanism of chromospheric

evaporation.

1 Introduction

Solar X-ray jets, extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) jets, surges are similar plasma eruptions that are

magnetically rooted in the photosphere and ejected into the corona along open magnetic ﬁled

lines (e.g., Shibata et al. 1994; Yokoyama & Shibata 1995; Raouaﬁ et al. 2016). Solar jets have
been extensively studied in many wavelengths, e.g., Hα (Schmieder et al. 1995; Li et al. 2015),

ultraviolet (UV; Chen et al. 2008), EUV (Jiang et al. 2007; Innes et al. 2016), X-ray (Zhang et

al. 2000) and white light (Moore et al. 2011).

Solar jets are ubiquitous transient features occurring in various solar environments, such

as coronal holes (Yang et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2012), active regions (ARs; Shimojo et al. 1996)

and quiet regions (Hong et al. 2011; Panesar et al. 2016). Sometimes, jets are observed to

be associated with ﬁlament eruptions (Moore et al. 2010; Sterling et al. 2015), coronal mass

ejections (CMEs, Shen et al. 2012) and ﬂares (Wang & Liu 2012).

The unceasing advances made on spatial and temporal resolution of data obtained by

diﬀerent space missions have enriched our understanding of diﬀerent observational processes

and numerical investigations behind solar jets. However, the underlying driving mechanisms of

solar jets have not been understood completely. A generally accepted driving mechanism for jets

is magnetic reconnection between emerging magnetic ﬂuxes and ambient magnetic ﬁelds (e.g.,

Canﬁeld et al. 1996; Zhang & Zhang 2017), which sometimes is also accompanied by magnetic

cancellation (Young & Muglach 2014). Furthermore, simulation works furnish evidence that

coronal jets can be generated by the mechanism of chromospheric evaporation (Shimojo et al.

2001; Miyagoshi & Yokoyama 2003).

There are also many small scale plasma eruptive phenomena such as macrospicules

and chromosphere dynamic structures like spicules and mottles. These jet-like structures are

thought to be diﬀerent scale jets or manifestations in diﬀerent wavelengths of the jet phe-

nomenon (e.g., De Pontieu et al. 2011; Tsiropoula et al. 2012). In this Letter, exploring the

X8.2 ﬂare produced in AR 12673 and the X1.0 class ﬂare in AR 12192, we reported the jet-like

features rooted in the ﬂare ribbons for the ﬁrst time.

2 Observations and data analysis

We adopted the observations from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al.

2012; Schou et al. 2012) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on

board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). The HMI full-disk line-of-
sight magnetograms with the pixel size of 0′′.5 and the cadence of 45 s were employed. AIA gives
2

full-Sun images with high spatial resolution (0.′′6 pixel−1, ∼ 430 km) and high temporal cadence
(12/24 s) in seven EUV wavelength bands and three UV-visible channels. On September 10,
we used the AIA 94 ˚A, 131 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, and 304 ˚A images, which have strong responses

to logarithmic temperatures (Kelvin) of about 6.8, 7.0 (and 5.6), 5.8, 6.2 and 4.7 respectively,

from 15:30 UT to 16:30 UT to study the jets occurring during the X8.2 ﬂare.

The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al. 2014) satellite pro-

vides simultaneous spectral and imaging observations of the solar atmosphere. For the X8.2
class ﬂare on 2017 September 10, we obtained a series of IRIS slit-jaw 1330 ˚A images taken
from 12:59:47 UT to 19:23:38 UT with a pixel scale of 0′′.333, a cadence of 9 s, and a ﬁeld
of view (FOV) of 119′′ × 119′′. The 1330 ˚A channel contains emission from the strong C II
1334/1335 ˚A lines formed in the chromosphere and lower transition region as well as the contin-

uum from the photosphere and lower chromosphere. For the X1.0 class ﬂare on 2014 October
25, we obtained the IRIS slit-jaw 1330 ˚A images with a cadence of 16 seconds and a pixel scale
of 0′′.333. We also employed the IRIS spectral proﬁles of two windows at “C II 1336” and “Si
IV 1394” with a cadence of 5 s.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 The X8.2 ﬂare on 2017 September 10

From 2017 September 4 to 10, AR 12673 produced 4 X-class, 27 M-class and plenty of lower-

class ﬂares, becoming the most actively ﬂaring region of Cycle 24 (Yang et al. 2017). On

September 10, an X8.2 class ﬂare occurred in this AR. This X8.2 class ﬂare started at 15:35 UT
and reached its peak at 16:06 UT. Using the AIA 171 ˚A observations (see Figures 1 (a1)−(a4)

and the animation of Figure 1), we observed numerous jet-like features at the south side of

this ﬂare. At 15:55 UT, these small scale jet-like features began to occur. Along with the

development of the ﬂare, the jets appeared farther south in succession since 16:09 UT, with an
average spreading speed of ∼ 45 km s−1. Two obvious jet-like features (labelled by “1” and “2”
in panel (a2)) are displayed. These features emerged, rapidly grew and had apparent velocities
of 192 km s−1 and 212 km s−1 in 171 ˚A, respectively. The apparent velocity here is the speed
of the propagating intensity front of the feature. The lengths of the two features were both
more than 9 Mm. The red arrows in panels (a3)−(a4) denote the post ﬂare loops in the 171 ˚A

observations. As the post ﬂare loops showed up, the jet-like features rooted in the footpoints

of these loops faded away (see panel (a4)). These jet-like features are also distinct on the other
AIA wavelength images. Panels (b1)−(b2) and panels (d1)−(d2) are the AIA 193 ˚A images

IRIS also observed lots of jet-like features rooted in the ﬂare ribbons (see the animation

of Figure 2) and the FOV of IRIS is delineated by the red square in Figure 1(a1). Figures
2(a1)−(a6) display the development of these jet-like features observed in IRIS 1330 ˚A. At 15:38

UT, small scale jet-like features (marked by the green arrow in panel (a1)) started to occur.

From 15:52 UT to 15:58 UT, the jet-like features on a ﬂare ribbon brightened up successively
as indicated by the green arrows in panels (a2)−(a4). The second ribbon can also be observed

since 15:58 UT, and there were a lot of jet-like features rooted in the both ﬂare ribbons as

shown in panel (a5). After 16:23 UT, there was cold material which started to condense at

the top of the loops and dropped to the footpoints, identifying the structures of the post-ﬂare

loops. Since the condensation showed up, these jet-like features located on the ﬂare ribbons

began to disappear (see panel (a6)). To estimate the number of the jet-like features, we studied
the brightness along the positions identiﬁed by slice “A−B” in panel (a4). The trend value

is estimated using the Single Gaussian ﬁtting. Figure 2(b) displays the result of brightness
minus the trend value. The background value was about 1000 DN pixel−1, and we deﬁned
that a feature’s brightness exceeded a quarter of the background brightness. Therefore, there
existed 28 jet-like features whose exceeded brightness were over 250 DN pixel−1 (the blue line
in panel (b)) on the 41 Mm length area. We estimate the number of the jet-like features and

its variations during the ﬂare are presented in panel (c) with the red cross symbols. The brown
curve displays the variation of the GOES soft X-ray 1-8 ˚A ﬂux, and the begin and peak times

of the ﬂare are indicated by the blue dotted lines. The jet-like features occurred after the ﬂare

began, and the number of jets increased. After the peak of the ﬂare, the number of the jet-like

features decreased and then disappeared.

Figure 3 displays the evolution of two jet-like features observed in IRIS 1330 ˚A images.

The blue arrows in the upper/lower panels point out the positions of the ﬁrst/second feature

we focus on. The ﬁrst jet-like feature occurred at the area outlined by the green rectangle in

Figure 2(a2), which began at 15:59:52 UT, rose up from the limb and then fell back. During
its rising stage, the feature had a apparent velocity of 44 km s−1. The feature had a maximum
width of 1040 km, and lasted for about 140 s. At 16:09:59 UT, the second feature took place

in the area delineated by the green rectangle in Figure 2(a5). It ejected upward, fell back, and

then disappeared at 16:10:55 UT. The width of the second feature was about 820 km, and the
feature had a apparent velocity of 116 km s−1.

We analyzed the properties of 15 isolated jet-like features. The lifetimes of the jet-like
features were 56 ∼ 184 s, with the mean value of 87 s. The widths of the jet-like features were

panels (a3) and (b3) indicate the trajectories of the bright points which we track to determine the velocities of these features.

between 670 and 1340 km, and the lengths of the jet-like features were 2.0 ∼ 3.8 Mm. All these
features went upward and had apparent velocities of 28 ∼ 116 km s−1. Through statistics,
the mean values of width, length and velocity of the jet-like features were 890 km, 2.7 Mm
and 70 km s−1, respectively. The IRIS observed the ﬂare ribbon with a length of 51 Mm, and
the occurrence of the jet-like features lasted for about 20 minutes. Since there were 28 jet-like

features on a 41 Mm length ﬂare ribbon and the mean lifetime of jet-like features was 87 s, we

can estimate that there arose approximately 480 jet-like features in the IRIS observations.

The jet-like features rooted in the ﬂare ribbons are reported for the ﬁrst time. The

temporal and spatial relationships between the jet-like features and ﬂare suggest that these jet-

like features may possess a diﬀerent driving mechanism, which is related to the onset of the two-

ribbon ﬂare. According to the standard model of two-ribbon ﬂares (Forbes 2010; Fletcher et al.

2011), magnetic reconnection release energy, and this energy accelerates non-thermal particles

and heats the plasma near the reconnection site. The combination of the thermal conduction

and particles beams transport the energy to the chromosphere through the relatively tenuous

7

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
corona and stop in the cooler, dense plasma. When the energy input to the chromosphere

exceeds what can be shed by radiative and conductive losses, chromospheric material is heated

rapidly up to a temperature on the order of 10 MK. The overpressure associated with the

chromospheric heating will drive the heated plasma upward to ﬁll the ﬂare loops (Priest &

Forbes 2002). The evaporation upﬂows are often from the outer edges of the ﬂare ribbons,

which may look like that the evaporation upﬂows are rooted in the ﬂare ribbons.

This ﬂare was located at the solar west limb, so we could directly observe the vertical

motions of the jet-like features against the solar surface. These jet-like features were rooted

in the ﬂare ribbons and could be recognised using the AIA EUV wavelengths. The velocities
of jet-like features were 28 ∼ 116 km s−1 with the mean value of 70 km s−1, consistent with
previous IRIS spectroscopic observations in which the velocities of evaporation upﬂows are
mostly around 100 km s−1 or smaller (e.g., Zhang et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017). Combining these
observations with the theory, we suggest that these jet-like features on the ﬂare ribbon were

driven by chromospheric evaporation.

3.2 The X1.0 ﬂare on 2014 October 25

Previous works on chromospheric evaporation mostly rely on spectroscopic observations, since

the best way to observe vertical ﬂow in on-disk observations is spectroscopy. The spectral

signature of chromospheric evaporation is the blueshift of hot emission lines, indicating the
presence of hot and fast (from tens of km s−1 to several hundreds of km s−1) plasma upﬂows
(Fisher et al. 1985; Tian et al. 2015). We checked more IRIS data to look for the events in

which similar jet-like features occurred and the features were captured by the IRIS slit. During

the X1.0 class on 2014 October 25, we found similar jet-like features. The X1.0 ﬂare happened

in AR 12192, which produced 6 X-class and 29 M-class ﬂares from October 18 to 29. As shown
in Figure 4(a), this ﬂare is a two-ribbon ﬂare. The GOES soft X-ray 1−8 ˚A ﬂux showed that

the X1.0 ﬂare initiated at 16:55 UT and reached its peak at 17:08 UT (see the green curve).
The ﬂare ribbons could also be observed using the IRIS 1330 ˚A slit-jaw images. During the

rising stage of the ﬂare, we observed several jet-like features at one ribbon of this ﬂare, and two
of them are displayed in Figures 4(b1)−(b2).

During the development of the jet-like feature “1”, it passed through the IRIS slit. At

the base of the jet-like feature (marked by the green cross symbols), we employed the IRIS

raster level 2 data, which have been dark corrected, ﬂat ﬁelded, and geometrically corrected,
to measure the spectral information of this jet-like feature. The hot line of Fe XXI 1354.08 ˚A

(log T ∼ 7.05) in the corona and the cool line of Si IV 1402.77 ˚A (log T ∼ 4.8) in the transition

region were chosen to investigate chromospheric evaporation (De Pontieu et al. 2014; Tian et
al. 2014). The nearby relatively strong neutral lines, “O I” 1355.5977 ˚A and “S I” 1401.5136
˚A (Tian et al. 2015) were used for absolute wavelength calibration, respectively. As shown in

rest position. There are several neutral and singly ionized lines, i.e., the C I line at 1354.29 ˚A,
the Fe II lines at 1353.02 ˚A, 1354.01 ˚A, and 1354.75 ˚A, the Si II lines at 1352.64 ˚A and 1353.72
˚A, and some unidentiﬁed lines at 1353.32 ˚A and 1353.39 ˚A, are blended with the broad line of
Fe XXI 1354.08 ˚A. However, these lines are narrow and cannot explain the bulk enhancement.

This emission feature is likely due to the blueshifted Fe XXI line. The blueshift of the Fe
XXI line became enhanced and more clear as the jet-like feature developed (∼ 143 km s−1,
see panel (d2) and Movie3). As shown in panels (e1) and (e2), the cool Si IV 1402.77 ˚A line

exhibits obvious redshift, and the Doppler velocity relative to the background was about 13
km s−1 (see panels (f1) and (f2)). Our results agree with the spectroscopic observations that
explosive chromospheric evaporation is usually identiﬁed by high speed blueshift (∼ 100−400
km s−1) in the hot lines from corona, and accompanied by chromospheric condensation which
is distinguished by low speed redshift (∼ 10−40 km s−1) in the cool lines from the upper
chromosphere and the transition region (Doschek et al. 2013).

4 Conclusions

We explored the X8.2 class ﬂare in AR 12673 on 2017 September 10. Using the SDO/AIA 171
˚A observations, we discovered lots of jet-like features occurring in succession along with the
development of the ﬂare ribbons. The average spreading speed of these features was 45 km s−1,
in accordance with the elongation velocity (ranging from 11 to 100 km s−1) of the ﬂare ribbons
(Fletcher et al. 2004; Qiu et al. 2017). The footpoints of these jet-like features were located on
the ﬂare ribbons and the apparent velocities of two most distinct jets were 153 km s−1 and 192
km s−1. These jet-like features could also be distinguished in other EUV wavelengths. Using
the high tempo-spatial IRIS 1330 ˚A data, we also observed a great deal of jet-like features

rooted in the ﬂare ribbons. During the development of the ﬂare, these jet-like features rose up

from the limb and then fell back. We studied 15 isolated features and their estimated lifetime,

average projected width, projected length and apparent velocity were 87 s, 885 km, 2.7 Mm
and 70 km s−1, respectively. After 16:23 UT, cold material started to condense, dropping from
the top to the footpoints of the loops, and the jet-like features stopped occurring.

Using the IRIS spectroscopic observations, we also investigated the jet-like features

appeared during the X1.0 ﬂare in AR 12192 on 2014 October 25. We analysed the spectral
proﬁles of Fe XXI 1354.08 ˚A and Si IV 1402.77 ˚A at the base of a jet-like feature. The hot Fe
XXI line is blueshifted by ∼ 143 km s−1, while the cool Si IV line exhibits obvious redshift of
∼ 13 km s−1, which is consistent with the scenario of chromospheric evaporation.

Here, we directly observed the jet-like features with apparent motion perpendicular to

the ﬂare ribbons, which is the direct observational evidence of chromospheric evaporation.
