LOCAL HOMOLOGICAL PROPERTIES AND
CYCLICITY OF HOMOGENEOUS ANR COMPACTA

V. VALOV

Abstract. In accordance with the Bing-Borsuk conjecture [2],
we show that if X is an n-dimensional homogeneous metric AN R
compactum and x ∈ X, then there is a local basis at x consist-
ing of connected open sets U such that the homological proper-
ties of U and bd U are similar to the properties of the closed ball
Bn ⊂ Rn and its boundary Sn−1. We discuss also the following
questions raised by Bing-Borsuk [2], where X is a homogeneous
AN R-compactum with dim X = n:

• Is it true that X is cyclic in dimension n?
• Is it true that no non-empty closed subset of X, acyclic in

dimension n − 1, separates X?

It is shown that both questions have simultaneously positive or
negative answers, and a positive solution to each one of them im-
plies a solution to another question of Bing-Borsuk (whether every
ﬁnite-dimensional homogenous metric AR-compactum is a point).

1. Introduction

There are few open problems concerning homogeneous compacta,
see [2]. The most important one is the well known Bing-Borsuk con-
jecture stating that every n-dimensional homogeneous metric ANR-
compactum X is an n-manifold. Another one is whether any such X
has the following properties: (i) X is cyclic in dimension n; (ii) no
closed non-empty subset of X, acyclic in dimension n − 1, separates X.
It is also unknown if there exists a non-trivial ﬁnite dimensional metric
homogeneous AR compactum.

In this paper we address the above problems and investigate the
homological structure of homogeneous metric ANR-compacta. In ac-
cordance with the Bing-Borsuk conjecture, we prove that any such a

compactum has local homological properties similar to the local struc-
ture of Rn, see Theorem 1.1. It is also shown that the properties (i)
and (ii) from the second of the above questions are equivalent, so each
one of them implies that every ﬁnite-dimensional homogeneous metric
AR is a point.

Reduced ˇCech homology Hn(X; G) and cohomology groups H n(X; G)
with coeﬃcients from G are considered everywhere below, where G is
an abelian group. Suppose (K, A) is a pair of closed subsets of a space
X with A ⊂ K. By in
A,K we denote the homomorphism from Hn(A; G)
into Hn(K; G) generated by the inclusion A ֒→ K. Following [2], we
say that K is an n-homology membrane spanned on A for an element
γ ∈ Hn(A; G) provided γ is homologous to zero in K, but not ho-
mologous to zero in any proper closed subset of K containing A. It
is well known [2, Property 5., p.103] that for every compact metric
space X and a closed set A ⊂ X the existence a non-trivial element
γ ∈ Hn(A; G) with in
A,X (γ) = 0 yields the existence of a closed set
K ⊂ X containing A such that K is an n-homology membrane for γ
spanned on A. We also say that a space K is a homological (n, G)-
bubble if Hn(K; G) 6= 0, but Hn(B; G) = 0 for every closed proper
subset B ⊂ K.

For any abelian group G, Alexandroﬀ [1] introduced the dimension
dGX of a space X as the maximum integer n such that there exist a
closed set F ⊂ X and a nontrivial element γ ∈ Hn−1(F ; G) with γ
being G-homologous to zero in X. According to [1, p.207] we have the
following inequalities for any metric ﬁnite-dimensional compactum X:
dGX ≤ dim X and dim X = dQ1X = dS1X, where G is any abelian
group, S1 is the circle group and Q1 is the group of rational elements
of S1.

Because the deﬁnition of dGX does not provide any information for
the homology groups Hk−1(F ; G) when F ⊂ X is closed and k <
dGX − 1, we consider the set HX,G of all integers k ≥ 1 such that there
exist a closed set F ⊂ X and a nontrivial element γ ∈ Hk−1(F ; G) with
ik−1
F,X(γ) = 0. Obviously, dGX = max HX,G.

Using the properties of the sets HX,G, we investigate in Section 2
the local homological properties of metric homogeneous ANR com-
pacta. The main result in that section is Theorem 1.1 below, which is
a homological version of [11, Theorem 1.1].

Theorem 1.1. Let X be a ﬁnite dimensional homogeneous metric
ANR with dim X ≥ 2. Then every point x ∈ X has a basis Bx = {Uk}
of open sets such that for any abelian group G and n ≥ 2 with n ∈ HX,G
and n + 1 6∈ HX,G almost all Uk satisfy the following conditions:

Homogeneous AN R

(1) Hn−1(bd U k; G) 6= 0 and U k is an (n − 1)-homology membrane
spanned on bd U k for any non-zero γ ∈ Hn−1(bd U k; G);
(2) Hn−1(U k; G) = Hn(U k; G) = 0 and X \ U k is connected;
(3) bd U k is a homological (n − 1, G)-bubble.

Corollary 1.2. Let X be as in Theorem 1.1. Then X has the following
property for any abelian group G and n ≥ 2 with n ∈ HX,G and n + 1 6∈
HX,G: If a closed subset K ⊂ X is an (n − 1)-homology membrane
spanned on B for some closed set B ⊂ X and γ ∈ Hn−1(B; G), then
(K \ B) ∩ X \ K = ∅.

In Section 3 we show that the following two statements are equiva-
lent, where H(n) is the class of all homogeneous metric ANR-compacta
X with dim X = n:

(1) For all n ≥ 1 and X ∈ H(n) there is a group G such that

H n(X; G) 6= 0 (resp., Hn(X; G) 6= 0);

(2) If X ∈ H(n) with n ≥ 1, and F ⊂ X is a closed separator of
X with dim F = n − 1, then there exists a group G such that
H n−1(F ; G) 6= 0 (resp., Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0).

Therefore, we have the following result (see Corollary 3.3):

Theorem 1.3. Suppose for all n ≥ 1 and all X ∈ H(n) the following
holds: For every closed separator F of X with dim F = n−1 there exists
a group G such that either H n−1(F ; G) 6= 0 or Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0. Then
there is no homogeneous metric AR-compactum Y with dim Y < ∞.

2. Local homological properties of homogeneous

ANR-compacta

We begin this section with the following analogue of Theorem 8.1

from [2].

Proposition 2.1. Let X be a locally compact and homogeneous sepa-
rable metrizable ANR space. Suppose there is a pair F ⊂ K of compact
proper subsets of X such that K is contractible in X and K is a homo-
logical membrane for some γ ∈ Hn−1(F ; G). If (K \ F ) ∩ X \ K 6= ∅,
then there exists of a proper compact subset P ⊂ X contractible in X
such that Hn(P ; G) 6= 0.

Proof. We follow the proof of [6, Lemma 1] (let us note that the proof
of Proposition 2.1 can also be obtained following the arguments of [2,
Theorem 8.1]). Let a ∈ (K \ F ) ∩ X \ K. Then a is a boundary
point for K. Because K is contractible in X, there is a homotopy
g : K × [0, 1] → X such that g(x, 0) = x and g(x, 1) = c ∈ X for

4

all x ∈ K. Then we can ﬁnd an open set U ⊂ X containing K and a
homotopy g : U ×[0, 1] → X extending g and connecting the identity on
U and the constant map U → c (this can be done since X is an ANR).
So, U is also contractible in X. Moreover, we can assume that U is
compact. Fix a metric d on X generating its topology in the following
way: consider X as a subspace of its one-point compactiﬁcation αX
and take d to be the restriction to X of some admissible metric on
αX. Let 2ǫ = d(a, F ) and take an open cover ω of U such that for
any two ω-close maps f1, f2 : K → U (i.e., for all x ∈ K the points
f1(x), f2(x) are contained in some element of ω) there is an ǫ-homotopy
Φ : K × [0, 1] → U between f1 and f2 (i.e., each set MΦ(x) = {Φ(x, t) :
t ∈ [0, 1]}, x ∈ K, is of diameter < ǫ). This can be done because U is
an ANR. Now, we ﬁx an open set V ⊂ X containing K with V ⊂ U
and let δ be the Lebesgue’s number of the open cover {Γ∩V : Γ ∈ ω} of
V . According to Eﬀros’ theorem [4], there is a positive number η such
that if x, y ∈ X are two points with d(x, y) < η, then f (x) = y for some
homeomorphism h : X → X, which is min{δ, d(K, X \ V }-close to the
identity on X (the Eﬀros’ theorem can be applied because of the special
choice of the metric d). Since a is a boundary point for K, we can choose
a point b ∈ V \K with d(a, b) < η. Then, there exists a homeomorphism
h′
1 : X → X such that h′
1(x)) < min{δ, d(K, X \ V },
x ∈ X. Let h1 be the restriction h′
1|K. Obviously, h1 : K → h1(K) is a
homeomorphism with h1(K) ⊂ V and h1 is δ-close to the identity on K.
Then, according to the choice of δ, there is homotopy h : K ×[0, 1] → U
such that h(x, 0) = x, h(x, 1) = h1(x) and d(x, h(x, t)) < ǫ for all x ∈ K
and t ∈ [0, 1].

1(a) = b and d(x, h′

Let K1 = K ∪ h(F × I), K2 = h1(K) and K0 = K1 ∩ K2, where
I = [0, 1]. Since 2ǫ = d(a, F ) and h is an ǫ-small homotopy, b ∈ K2 \K1.
So, K0 is a proper subset of K2 containing h1(F ). Hence, D = h−1
1 (K0)
is a proper subset of K containing F , which implies γ1 = in−1
F,D (γ) 6= 0.
Because h1 is a homeomorphism, (ϕ1)∗ : Hn−1(D; G) → Hn−1(K0; G)
is an isomorphism, where ϕ1 = h1|D. Thus, ˆγ = (ϕ1)∗(γ1) 6= 0.

We are in a position now to complete the proof of Proposition 3.1.
Let P = K1 ∪ K2. Since h(K × I) ⊂ U, P ⊂ U. Therefore, P is
contractible in X (recall that U is contractible in X). Finally, by
Claim 1 and the Phragmen-Brouwer theorem (see [2]), there exists a
(cid:3)
non-trivial α ∈ Hn(P ; G).

For simplicity, we say that a closed set F ⊂ X is strongly contractible
in X if F is contractible in a closed set A ⊂ X and A is contractible
in X.

Corollary 2.2. Let X be a homogeneous compact metrizable ANR-
space such that n ∈ HX,G and n + 1 6∈ HX,G. Then for every closed set
F ⊂ X we have:

(1) Hn(F ; G) = 0 provided F is contractible in X;
(2) F separates X provided Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0 and F is strongly con-

tractible in X;

(3) If K is a homological membrane for some non-trivial element of
Hn−1(F ; G) and K is contractible in X, then (K \F )∩X \ K =
∅.

Proof. Since F is contractible in X, every γ ∈ Hn(F ; G) is homologous
to zero in X. So, the existence of a non-trivial element of Hn(F ; G)
would imply n + 1 ∈ HX,G, a contradiction.

To prove the second item, suppose Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0 and F is strongly
contractible in X. So, there exists a closed set A ⊂ X such that F is
contractible in A and A is contractible in X. Then, by [2, Property 5.,
p.103], we can ﬁnd a closed set K ⊂ A containing F which is a homolog-
ical membrane for some non-trivial γ ∈ Hn−1(F ; G). Because K (as a
subset of A) is contractible in X, the assumption (K \ F ) ∩ X \ K 6= ∅
would yield the existence of a proper closed set P ⊂ X contractible
in X with Hn(P ; G) 6= 0 (see Proposition 2.1). Consequently, there
would be a non-trivial α ∈ Hn(P ; G) homologous to zero in X. Hence,
n + 1 ∈ HX,G, a contradiction. Therefore, (K \ F ) ∩ X \ K = ∅. This
means that X \ F = (K \ F ) ∪ (X \ K) with both K \ F and X \ K
being non-empty open disjoint subsets of X.

The above arguments provide also the proof of the third item.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Suppose X satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theo-
rem 1.1. By [11, Theorem 1.1], every x ∈ X has a basis Bx = {Uk}k≥1
of open sets satisfying the following conditions: bdUk = bd U k; the sets
Uk, bd U k and X \ U k are connected; H dim X−1(A; Z) = 0 for all proper
closed sets A ⊂ bd U k. We may also suppose that each U k+1 is con-
tractible in Uk and all U k are strongly contractible in X. Let G be an
abelian group and n ≥ 2 with n + 1 6∈ HX,G and n ∈ HX,G. So, there
exist a closed set B ⊂ X and a nontrivial element γ ∈ Hn−1(B; G)
with in−1
B,X (γ) = 0. Then, by [2, Property 5., p.103], there is a closed set
K ⊂ X containing B which is a homological membrane for γ. We ﬁx a
x ∈ K \ B and its open in K neighborhood W with W ∩ B = ∅.
point
e
According to [2, Property 6., p.103], W is an (n − 1)-homological mem-
brane for some non-trivial element of Hn−1(bdKW ; G). We can choose
W so small that W is contractible in X. Then Corollary 2.2 yields
(W \ bdKW ) ∩ X \ W = ∅. So, W \ bdKW is open in X and contains
x. Hence, there exists k0 such that Uk ⊂ W \ bdKW for all Uk ∈ Bex
with k ≥ k0. Below we consider only the elements Uk with k ≥ k0.
e
Applying again [2, Property 6., p.103], we conclude that every U k is a
homological membrane for some non-trivial element of Hn−1(bdUk; G).
By Corollary 2.2(1), Hn(U k; G) = 0. Suppose γ ∈ Hn−1(bdUk; G)
is non-trivial. Since X \ U k is connected, Corollary 2.2(2) implies

Homogeneous AN R

7

that Hn−1(U k; G) = 0. Consequently, γ is homologous to zero in U k.
So, by [2, Property 5., p.103], U k contains a closed set P such that
P is a homological membrane for γ. Then Corollary 2.2(3) implies
(P \ bdUk) ∩ X \ P = ∅. Hence, X \ bdUk is the union of the disjoint
open sets P \bdUk and X \P . Because Uk is connected and Uk ∩P 6= ∅,
Uk ⊂ P \ bdUk. Therefore, P = U k. This provides the proof of the
ﬁrst two conditions of Theorem 1.1.

To prove the last item of Theorem 1.1, assume that Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0
for some closed proper subset F of bdUk+1, where k ≥ k0. Because
F (as a subset of U k+1) is strongly contractible in X, according to
Corollary 2.2(2), F separates X. So, X \ F is the union of two disjoint
non-empty open in X sets V1 and V2 with V 1 ∩ V 2 ⊂ F . Let us show
that F separates U k. Indeed, otherwise U k \ F would be connected.
Then U k \ F should be contained in one of the sets V1, V2, say V1.
Since X \ U k is also connected and V2 6= ∅, X \ U k ⊂ V2. Hence,
U k \ F ∩ X \ U k ⊂ F . On the other hand, because U k \ F is dense in
U k (recall that F does not contain interior points), U k \ F ∩ X \ U k =
bdUk. So, F ⊃ bdUk, a contradiction. Therefore, F separates U k.

The proof of Theorem 1.1(3) will be done if we show that F can
not separate U k. According to [11, Theorem 1.1], U k is an (m − 1)-
cohomology membrane spanned on bdUk for some non-trivial α ∈
H m−1(bdUk; Z), where m = dim X. This means that α (considered
as a map from bdUk to the Eilenberg-MacLane complex K(Z, m − 1))
is not extendable over U k but it is extendable over any proper closed
subset of U k. Hence, by [9, Proposition 2.10], the couple (U k, bdUk)
Z -manifold (see [9] for the deﬁnition of a strong K m
is a strong K m
Z -
manifold). So, according to [9, Theorem 3.3], H m−1(F ; Z) 6= 0 because
F separates U k and F ∩ bdUk = ∅. Finally, we obtained a contra-
diction because H m−1(A; Z) = 0 for every proper closed subset A of
bdUk+1. Therefore, the all Uk, k ≥ k0 + 1, satisfy conditions (1) − (3)
from Theorem 1.1. ✷

Proof of Corollary 1.2. Suppose there exists a point a ∈ (K \ B) ∩
X \ K and take a set U ∈ Ba satisfying condition (1) − (3) from The-
orem 1.1 such that U ∩ B = ∅. Then FU = bdK(U ∩ K) is non-empty
and it follows from [2, Property 6., p.103] that U ∩ K is a homology
membrane for some non-zero α ∈ Hn−1(FU ; G). Because FU ⊂ bdU,
by Theorem 1.1(3), FU = bdU. So, U is a homological membrane for
α, see Theorem 1.1(1). This implies that in−1
bdU,U ∩K(α) 6= 0 provided
U ∩ K is a proper subset of U . Therefore, U ∩ K = U, which yields

8

U ⊂ K. The last inclusion contradicts the fact that a ∈ X \ K. Hence,
(K \ B) ∩ X \ K = ∅. ✷

3. Cyclicity of homogeneous ANR’s

Let H(n) be the class of all homogeneous metric ANR-compacta X

with dim X = n.

Theorem 3.1. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) If n ≥ 1, then for every space X ∈ H(n) there exists a group G

with H n(X; G) 6= 0;

(2) If n ≥ 1 and X ∈ H(n), then for every closed set F ⊂ X
separating X there exists a group G with H n−1(F ; G) 6= 0;
(3) If n ≥ 1 and X ∈ H(n), then for every (n − 1)-dimensional
closed set F ⊂ X separating X there exists a group G with
H n−1(F ; G) 6= 0.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) Suppose n ≥ 1 and X ∈ H(n). Then H n(X; G) 6= 0
for some group G, and by [10, Corollary 1.2], H n−1(F ; G) 6= 0 for every
non-empty closed set F ⊂ X separating X.
(2) ⇒ (3) This implication is trivial.
(3) ⇒ (1) Suppose that condition (3) holds, but there exists n ≥ 1
and X ∈ H(n) such that H n(X; G) = 0 for all groups G. Consider
the two-dimensional sphere S2 and a circle S1 separating S2. Then
X×S2 ∈ H(n+2) and X×S1 is a closed separator of X×S2 of dimension
n + 1. So, there is a group G′ such that H n+1(X × S1; G′) 6= 0. On
the other hand, according to the K¨unneth formula, we have the exact
sequence

H i(X) ⊗ H j(S1) → H n+1(X × S1) → X

X
i+j=n+1
where the coeﬃcient group G′ is suppressed. Because dim X = n and
dim S1 = 1, H n+i(X; G′) = 0 and H 1+i(S1; G′) = 0 for all i ≥ 1.
Moreover, H n(X; G′) = 0. So,

H i(X) ∗ H j(S1),

i+j=n+2

H i(X; G′) ⊗ H j(S1; G′) = X

X
i+j=n+1
Hence, H n+1(X × S1; G′) = 0, a contradiction.

i+j=n+2

H i(X; G′) ∗ H j(S1; G′) = 0.

(cid:3)

A homological version of Theorem 3.1 also holds.

Theorem 3.2. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) If n ≥ 1, then for every space X ∈ H(n) there exists a group G

with Hn(X; G) 6= 0;

Homogeneous AN R

(2) If n ≥ 1 and X ∈ H(n), then for every closed set F ⊂ X
separating X there exists a group G with Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0;
(3) If n ≥ 1 and X ∈ H(n), then for every (n − 1)-dimensional
closed set F ⊂ X separating X there exists a group G with
Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0.

Proof. Everywhere below,
H∗ denotes the exact homology (see [5], [7]),

which for locally compact metric spaces is equivalent to Steenrod’s ho-
mology [8]. For every compact metric space X and every k there exists
a surjective homomorphism T k

(1) ⇒ (2) Suppose n ≥ 1 and X ∈ H(n). Then Hn(X; G) 6= 0 for

some group G. By [7, Theorem 3], we have the exact sequence

(∗) Ext(H n+1(X; Z), G) →

Hn(X; G) → Hom(H n(X; Z), G) → 0.
b

Since dim X = n, H n+1(X; Z) = 0. Moreover
Hn(X; G) is non-
b
trivial because so is Hn(X; G) and T n
X is a surjective homomorphism.
Hence, H n(X; Z) 6= 0 and there exists a non-trivial homomorphism
ϕ : H n(X; Z) → G. Now, let F ⊂ X be a closed separator of X and
X \ F = X1 ∪ X2, where X1, X2 ⊂ X are closed proper subsets with
X1 ∩ X2 = F . Since H n(P ; Z) = 0 for every closed proper subset
P ⊂ X (see [10]), H n(F ; Z) = H n(X1; Z) = H n(X2; Z) = 0. Then it
follows from the Mayer-Vietoris sequence

H n−1(F ; Z)

ψ /

/ H n(X1; Z) ⊕ H n(X1; Z)

that H n−1(F ; Z) 6= 0 and ∂ is a surjective homomorphism. Conse-
quently, ϕ ◦ ∂ : H n−1(F ; Z) → G is also a non-trivial surjective homo-
morphism. Hence, Hom(H n−1(F ; Z), G) 6= 0 and the exact sequence
Hn−1(F ; G) → Hom(H n−1(F ; Z), G) → 0
b

0 → Ext(H n(F ; Z), G) →

yields
isomorphic to Hn−1(F ; G).

Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0. Finally, since H n(F ; Z) = 0,
b

Hn−1(F ; G) is

(2) ⇒ (3) This implication is obvious.
(3) ⇒ (1) As in the proof of Theorem 3.1, (3) ⇒ (1), suppose there
exists n ≥ 1 and X ∈ H(n) such that Hn(X; G) = 0 for all groups
Hn(X; G) is isomorphic to Hn(X; G) and H n+1(X; Z) = 0
G. Since
b
(recall that dim X = n), it follows from the exact sequence (∗) that
Hom(H n(X; Z), G) = 0 for all groups G. This implies H n(X; Z) = 0.
As above, the product X × S1 is a closed separator of X × S2, and

according to our assumption, Hn+1(X × S1; G′) 6= 0 for some group G′.
Because dim X × S1 = n + 1, Hn+1(X × S1; G′) ∼=
Hn+1(X × S1; G′)
b
and H n+2(dim X × S1, Z) = 0. Therefore, the exact sequence

Ext(H n+2(X ×S1), G′) →

Hn+1(X ×S1; G′) → Hom(H n+1(X ×S1), G′),
b

where the coeﬃcient group Z in H n+2(X × S1) and H n+1(X × S1) are
suppressed, yields that H n+1(X × S1; Z) 6= 0. On the other hand, the
K¨unneth formula from the proof of Theorem 3.1 (with Z being the
coeﬃcient group in all cohomology groups) implies H n+1(X × S1; Z) =
(cid:3)
0, a contradiction.

Corollary 3.3. Suppose for all n ≥ 1 and all X ∈ H(n) the following
holds: For every closed separator F of X with dim F = n−1 there exists
a group G such that either H n−1(F ; G) 6= 0 or Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0. Then
there is no homogeneous metric AR-compactum Y with dim Y < ∞.

If H(G, n) denotes the class of all homogeneous metric ANR-compacta

X with dimG X = n, the arguments from Theorem 3.1 provide the fol-
lowing result:

Proposition 3.4. The following conditions are equivalent:
(1) H n(X; G) 6= 0 for all X ∈ H(G, n) and all n ≥ 1;
(2) If X ∈ H(G, n) and n ≥ 1, then H n−1(F ; G) 6= 0 for every

closed set F ⊂ X separating X;

(3) If X ∈ H(G, n) and n ≥ 1, H n−1(F ; G) 6= 0 for every closed

set F ⊂ X separating X with dimG F = n − 1.

The corresponding homological analogue of Proposition 3.4 also holds

for some groups G.

Proposition 3.5. The following conditions are equivalent, where G is
either a ﬁeld or a torsion free group:

(1) Hn(X; G) 6= 0 for all X ∈ H(n) and all n ≥ 1;
(2) If X ∈ H(n), n ≥ 1, and F ⊂ X is a closed set separating X,

then Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0;

(3) If X ∈ H(n), n ≥ 1, and F ⊂ X is a closed set separating X

with dim F = n − 1, then Hn−1(F ; G) 6= 0.

Proof. All implications except (3) ⇒ (1) follow from the proof of Theo-
rem 3.2. To prove (3) ⇒ (1), we suppose there exists a space X ∈ H(n)
with Hn(X; G) = 0. Considering the (n + 1)-dimensional separator
X × S1 of X × S2, we conclude that Hn+1(X × S1; G) 6= 0. Because
X and X × S1 are ANR’s, their ˇCech homology groups are isomorphic

to the singular homology groups. Thus, we can apply the K¨unneth
formula

X
i+j=n+1

Hi(X) ⊗ Hj(S1) → Hn+1(X × S1) → X
i+j=n

Hi(X) ∗ Hj(S1),

where G is the coeﬃcient group. Since Hn(X; G) = Hn+1(X; G) = 0
and Hj(S1; G) = 0 for all j > 1, Pi+j=n+1 Hi(X; G)⊗Hj(S1; G) = 0. If
G is a torsion free group, then the group Pi+j=n Hi(X; G)∗Hj(S1; G) is
also trivial because H1(S1; G) = G yields Hn−1(X; G) ∗ H1(S1; G) = 0.
Therefore, Hn+1(X × S1; G) = 0, a contradiction.

When G is a ﬁeld, the group Hn+1(X × S1; G) is isomorphic to the
trivial group Pi+j=n+1 Hi(X; G) ⊗ Hj(S1; G). So, we have again a
(cid:3)
contradiction.
