ABSTRACT

Since Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the major drivers of space weather, it is crucial to study
their evolution starting from the inner corona. In this work we use Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS)
model to study the 3D evolution of 59 CMEs in the inner (< 3R(cid:12)) and outer (> 3R(cid:12)) corona using
observations from COR-1 and COR-2 on-board Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO)
spacecraft. We identify the source regions of these CMEs and classify them as CMEs associated with
Active Regions (ARs), Active Prominences (APs), and Prominence Eruptions (PEs). We ﬁnd 27 %
of CMEs show true expansion and 31 % show true deﬂections as they propagate outwards. Using 3D
kinematic proﬁles of CMEs, we connect the evolution of true acceleration with the evolution of true
width in the inner and outer corona. Thereby providing the observational evidence for the inﬂuence
of the Lorentz force on the kinematics to lie in the height range of 2.5 − 3 R(cid:12). We ﬁnd a broad range
in the distribution of peak 3D speeds and accelerations ranging from 396 to 2465 km s−1 and 176 to
10922 m s−2 respectively with a long tail towards high values coming mainly from CMEs originating
from ARs or APs. Further, we ﬁnd the magnitude of true acceleration is be inversely correlated to its
duration with a power law index of -1.19. We believe that these results will provide important inputs
for the planning of upcoming space missions which will observe the inner corona and the models that
study CME initiation and propagation.

1. INTRODUCTION

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are large structures of plasma with embedded magnetic ﬁelds that are ejected from
the solar atmosphere into the heliosphere (Webb & Howard 2012). They appear as discrete, bright, white light feature
propagating outwards in the coronagraph ﬁeld of view (FOV) (Hundhausen et al. 1984). CMEs apart from being such
dynamics events, they are also the major drivers of space weather as they are capable of producing events like transient
interplanetary disturbances, shock waves (Gosling 1993), Thus, it is importaant to understand their kinematics. CMEs
have been studied for several decades, with their observations dating back to the 1970s (Hansen et al. 1971). Dere
et al. (1997) made ﬁrst observation of the CME from its initiation to propagation in the outer corona while combining
data from Extreme ultra-violet Imaging telescope (EIT) (Delaboudini`ere et al. 1995) and Large Angle Spectroscopic
COronagraph (LASCO) (Brueckner et al. 1995) on board Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). St. Cyr et al.
(1999) investigated the kinematics of 246 CMEs observed between 1980 and 1989 combining the observations from
the inner ( < 2R(cid:12)) to outer (> 2R(cid:12)) corona using MK-3 K-coronameter (FOV: 1.12 - 2.44 R(cid:12)) at Mauna Loa Solar
Observatory (MLSO) and Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) (1.5 - 6 R(cid:12); MacQueen et al. 1980). It was proposed that a

driving force is responsible for the continuous acceleration and expansion of CMEs up to the FOV of the SMM. Later,
it was reported that CMEs pose three-phase kinematic proﬁle with an initial slow gradual rise phase, an impulsive
acceleration phase below 2 R(cid:12), and the ﬁnal phase with constant or decreasing speed (Zhang et al. 2001; Zhang et al.
2004; Bein et al. 2011). Beyond this, a CME propagates in the interplanetary medium with almost constant speed or
show gradual acceleration/deceleration due to the interaction with the ambient solar wind (Gopalswamy et al. 2000).
Thus, an anti-correlation between the average speed and acceleration, interpreted as an eﬀect of aerodynamic drag,
was found in height between 2-30 R(cid:12) for over 5000 CMEs (Vrˇsnak et al. 2004). Furthermore, it was found that during
the CME propagation, greater acceleration magnitudes (A) have small duration (T) and vice versa following A ∼ T−1
(Zhang & Dere 2006).

The study of the observable properties of CMEs using a large sample from SOHO provided an understanding on the
nature of CMEs and variation with the solar cycle (St. Cyr et al. 2000; Yashiro et al. 2004; Gopalswamy 2006; Vrˇsnak
et al. 2007; Gopalswamy et al. 2009).

CMEs are observed to be associated with ﬂares and eruptive prominences (Webb & Howard 2012). The kinematics
of CMEs associated with these two classes are investigated in earlier studies (Sheeley et al. 1999; Moon et al. 2002;
Chen et al. 2006; Bein et al. 2012). Vrˇsnak et al. (2005) studied a sample of 545 CMEs and reported a contrasting
result demonstrating that both the CME classes have similar kinematics characteristics. It has been observed that the
CME kinematics is governed by the interplay of three forces, namely the Lorentz force, the gravitational force and the
viscous drag force which is manifested in a wide range in their kinematics with their speeds ranging from a few tens to
thousands km s−1 and their acceleration ranging from a few tens to even a few 104 m s−2 (Wood et al. 1999; Zhang
et al. 2001; Webb & Howard 2012; Vrˇsnak et al. 2007). Also, CMEs attain enormous acceleration in the inner corona
where a strong magnetic ﬁeld generates large Lorentz force (Vrˇsnak et al. 2007; Bein et al. 2011). Recently, Cheng
et al. (2020) studied the slow rise and main acceleration phase of 12 CMEs using the data from Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) on-board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (Lemen et al. 2011) and EUVI on-board STEREO
and suggested that the main acceleration phase is qualitatively diﬀerent from the slow rise phase and that diﬀerent
physical mechanisms govern these two phases. Hence to understand this initial impulsive acceleration and the forces
involved in propelling the CME, it is important to understand the kinematics of CMEs in the inner corona (<2 R(cid:12)).
Apart from radial propagation, CMEs also exhibit lateral expansion leading to a increase in the width from the
inner to outer corona (Kay et al. (2015), and references therein). In earlier studies of CMEs the variation of radial
and expansion speeds was found and shown that it was dependent on the width of the CMEs (MacQueen & Fisher
1983; Gopalswamy et al. 2009).

The lateral expansion of CMEs is due to the injected energy from the magnetic ﬁeld of the source region.
The Lorentz force from this injected magnetic energy gives the necessary thrust that translates the CME and leads

to its expansion (Subramanian et al. 2014; Suryanarayana 2019).

Recently Cremades et al. (2020) studied 12 CMEs using the data from the SDO/AIA, SOHO/LASCO,
STEREO/SECCHI coronagraphs and inferred from 3D reconstruction that the initial true expansion of CMEs
below 3 R(cid:12) is asymmetric and non-self-similar.

It should be noted that in the studies based on LASCO-C1, EUVI or AIA to probe inner corona, the images observed
in emission lines were used to track CMEs. It is still debatable if the same features are observed in emission lines and
white-light. Moreover, a major limitation of all these studies is that the properties of CMEs, width, speed, acceleration,
propagation direction, are measured using observations from single view-point. As a result these values measured in the
plane of sky suﬀer from projection eﬀects (Cremades & Bothmer 2004; Burkepile et al. 2004; Temmer 2016; Balmaceda
et al. 2018a). To overcome such limitation, Sarkar et al. (2019) (and references therein) exploited the coronal cavity
observed in EUV and white-light images and found that the spatial relationship is preserved while tracking the feature
in 3D in these pass-bands. Further to minimise the projection eﬀects, Mierla et al. (2008) derived the 3D-kinematics
of CMEs using STEREO/COR-1, COR-2 images from two vantage points by a triangulation method and compared it
with other methods (Mierla et al. 2009, 2010, 2011). Using polarimetric capability of COR-1 A and B coronagraphs,
Moran et al. (2010) determined the 3D orientation of a CME. Another method based on forward modelling to ﬁt the
CME ﬂux rope on multi vantage point images was developed assuming the self-similar expansion of CMEs (Thernisien
et al. 2006, 2009; Thernisien 2011). An automated method based on triangulation to identify and track 3D structure
of CMEs is recently developed by Hutton & Morgan (2017).

One of the ﬁrst 3D kinematical study of CMEs combining the data from STEREO/EUVI and coronagraphs was
done by Joshi & Srivastava (2011). Bosman et al. (2012) derived and catalogued 3D properties of 51 CMEs from

3D evolution of CMEs

January 2007 to December 2010 using the data from STEREO/COR-2. Sachdeva et al. (2015) used a sample of 8
CMEs observed by SOHO/LASCO C2, STEREO/COR2 and STEREO/HI to study their propagation in 3D and the
impact of aerodynamic drag, and further extended their study in Sachdeva et al. (2017) to 38 events to understand
the relative importance of Lorentz force and drag force, but their height measurements left out the information in the
inner corona. The multi-viewpoint analysis of a CME observed on March 28, 2013 yielded a linear increase in angular
width of CME up to 5 R(cid:12) (Cabello et al. 2016).

A sample of 460 CMEs observed by twin STEREO spacecrafts was used to compare the single-viewpoint and 3D
kinematics (via triangulation) of CMEs in COR-2 FOV (Balmaceda et al. 2018a). It is worth noting that although
these studies provide 3D kinematic information, most of the analysis (Cremades et al. (2020) and Cabello et al. (2016)
being exceptions in this context) are carried out starting from the COR-2 FOV, and hence the essential information
in the inner corona is left out. Thus the major gap in our understanding of CME kinematics is to understand their
3D evolution in the inner corona.

During the early evolution phase, CMEs often show non-radial deﬂections in their trajectories (Gopalswamy et al.
2009; Gui et al. 2011; Lugaz et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2019). It has been observed that CMEs can get deﬂected from
their initial path when they get ejected near a coronal hole (Gopalswamy et al. 2009; Kahler et al. 2012).

Kay et al. (2013) developed a tool, ForeCAT (Forecasting a CME’s Altered Trajectory) for studying CME deﬂections
due to the magnetic forces. Kay et al. (2015) (and references therein), reported on observed latitudinal and longitudinal
deﬂections suﬀered by CMEs as they propagated outwards. A study of these deﬂections is important for a better
understanding of their trajectories and also for better space weather forecasting (Kay et al. 2015).

As it has been established that the Lorentz force is responsible for propelling and expanding the CME (Subramanian
et al. 2014), a connection between the evolution of the width of CMEs with their kinematic proﬁles will shed light on
the imprint of Lorentz force on the evolution of CMEs. In this work, to gain a better understanding of the kinematics
of CMEs, we perform a statistical study of 3D evolution of 59 CMEs in the inner and outer corona occurring between
May 2007 to April 2014 and connect them to their source region. To keep uniqueness in the physical feature we track
the CME only in white light coronagraph data. Since the use of triangulation method involves a smaller feature (point)
reconstructed in 3D, we used the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model developed by Thernisien et al. (2006, 2009)
which ﬁts a ﬂux rope to entire CME structure using a pair of observed images by the coronagraphs COR-1 and COR-2
on-board STEREO spacecrafts from two diﬀerent points. In this work we track the 3D structure of CMEs and try to
understand their true evolution during the propagation. The paper is organised as follow: in Section 2 we outline the
data sources that have been used followed by the working method. The results of our analysis are presented in Section
3 followed by summary and conclusions in Section 4.

2. DATA AND METHOD

2.1. Data Source and Data Preparation

We have used the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) catalogue, which records the properties of CMEs
detected manually in the SOHO/LASCO images (Gopalswamy et al. 2009) to select events. The data from diﬀerent
passbands of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (Lemen et al. 2011)
and Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) (Delaboudini`ere et al. 1995) on-board SOHO were used to identify
the source regions of CMEs that were coming from the front side of the Sun. For events happening at the back side of
the Sun, data from EUVI on-board Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) package
(Howard et al. 2002) of the twin spacecraft STEREO-A and STEREO-B was used. Since we aim to understand the
3D evolution of CMEs in the inner corona, high cadence data from multiple vantage points are needed. The COR-1
coronagraph on-board STEREO-A and STEREO-B oﬀers high cadence (5 minutes) observation of the inner corona
from two vantage points, which can be used to reconstruct the 3D structure of the CME. In this regard, the data
from COR-1 with ﬁeld of view 1.5 - 4 R(cid:12) and COR-2 having ﬁeld of view from 2.5 - 15 R(cid:12) of the SECCHI package
on-board STEREO-A and STEREO-B was combined to study the kinematics of CMEs close to their initiation in the
inner corona and their further evolution. Level 0.5 data of EUVI, COR-1 and COR-2 was reduced to level 1 using
secchi prep.pro in IDL. Next, base diﬀerence images were created by subtracting a pre-event image from successive
images of the event, thus ensuring that we are tracking the same feature in all images.

2.2. Event selection and Source Region identiﬁcation

4

Majumdar et al.

We select CMEs from the CDAW catalogue, occurring during the period from May 2007 to April 2014 which includes
the period of minimum sunspots in solar cycle 23 to the period of maximum sunspots of cycle 24, and which are bright in
STEREO data, so that GCS model can be ﬁtted with reasonable accuracy. We selected CMEs which showed a distinct
leading edge that can be clearly tracked in successive images of COR-1 and COR-2. We did not select CMEs which were
marked as ”very poor” in the CDAW catalogue because such CMEs have a very faint leading edge which is not clearly
seen in the successive frames of COR-1 and COR-2 images, thus tracking them can be ambiguous. In this regard, we
note that there are also other automated CME catalogues like SEEDs (Olmedo et al. 2008), CACTUS (Robbrecht &
Berghmans 2004; Pant et al. 2016), ARTEMIS (Boursier et al. 2009), CORIMP (Morgan et al. 2012; Byrne et al. 2012),
and others. JHUAPL (Vourlidas et al. 2017) identiﬁes the events visually, the measurements are however estimated
by a semi-automatic algorithm. But Since, we choose bright events in our analysis so that GCS model can be ﬁtted
with reasonable accuracy, these events are likely to be captured by both manual and automated catalogs. It seems
it does not matter which catalog we use to identify the CMEs. Having said that, we understand that the estimates
of the kinematic properties (such as velocity, width, and accelerations) might be diﬀerent in diﬀerent catalogs due
to diﬀerent measurement techniques used. But, our conclusions are not based on any catalogued parameters, and is
completely based on the computed GCS parameters. Thus, the choice of catalogue will not aﬀect our results. Only in
Section 3.3 we show a comparison of projected and true speeds to show the importance of true speeds over projected
speeds. For this we use CDAW speed because CDAW tracks the leading edge manually, and our work also involves
manual ﬁtting of the GCS model. Thus we believe that using automated catalogs instead of manual catalog will not
signiﬁcantly alter the results of this study. Motivated by the facts that CMEs show a wide range in their speeds (Webb
& Howard 2012) and that the average solar wind speed naturally divides CMEs into slow and fast ones (Gopalswamy
et al. 2000), we segregate the selected CMEs into slow (< 400 km s−1) and fast (> 400 km s−1) based on the average
solar wind speed, which is around 400 km s−1 (Schwenn 2006). After putting these constraints on our event selection,
we then back project the CMEs on to the solar disk and with the help of the data from SOHO/EIT (195 ˚A, 304 ˚A),
SDO/AIA (171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 304 ˚A), STEREO-A/EUVI-A (195 ˚A, 304 ˚A) and STEREO-B/EUVI-B (195 ˚A, 304 ˚A), we
identify their source regions. For associating a CME to its source region we follow a similar procedure as mentioned
in Gilbert et al. (2000). We spatially associate a source region to a CME by requiring that the latitude of the source
region to be around ± 30◦ to that of the central position angle (PA) of the CME converted to equivalent apparent
latitude (latP A) by the following relation:

latP A = 90 − P A [0 ≤ P A ≤ 180]

latP A = P A − 270

[180 < P A ≤ 360].

(1)

We temporally associate them by requiring that the source region erupts or shows radially outward movement in the
above latitude window within at least 30 minutes before the time of ﬁrst appearance of the CME leading edge in the
LASCO C2 ﬁeld of view. We classify the identiﬁed source regions into three broad categories. Active Regions (ARs),
which are regions of strong magnetic ﬁeld showing bright emissions in EUV and X-rays, Prominence Eruptions (PEs),
which are the quiescent prominences seen as dense hanging feature in the solar atmosphere and Active Prominences
(APs) which are PEs with their one or more foot-points connected to ARs (also refer Subramanian & Dere (2001)).
After associating the CMEs to their source regions, we segregated the CMEs into 6 separate classes, fast CMEs from
ARs, PEs, and APs and similarly for slow CMEs.

2.3. 3D Reconstruction and Estimation of Geometrical Parameters

To study the 3D kinematics of these CMEs, we use the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model developed by
Thernisien et al. (2009). This model assumes a ﬂux-rope structure of CMEs. It provides 6 parameters: height of the
leading front (h), longitude (φ), latitude (θ), tilt-angle (γ), aspect-ratio (k), and half-angle (α), to ﬁt the model to
an event and reproduce the large scale ﬂux-rope structure of the CME. We use this model by ﬁtting a geometrical
wireframe structure of the model simultaneously to a synchronized pair of SECCHI (EUVI, COR-1 and COR-2)
images. This geometrical structure resembles a hollow croissant with conical legs, and with a front section which is
in the approximate shape of a torus. This cross-section (a(r)) increases with height (r) subject to the condition that
the ratio of the former to the later (k = a(r)/r) is constant with time, where the k is the aspect-ratio parameter. The
ﬁtting is done interactively, until a good visual match is obtained between the wireframe projection of the model and
both the data views from COR-1 (A and B) or COR-2 (A and B). We start with a pair of image where the CME
leading front is well developed. We set the half-angle to zero initially and adjust the latitude and longitude to set
the location of the foot-point of the model. Then the height is adjusted until the wireframe covers the leading outer

3D evolution of CMEs

front of the CME. Next, we adjust the aspect-ratio to match the spatial extension of the CME. Finally, we change
and adjust the half-angle and tilt angle until the best visual match is obtained. Figure 1 shows an example of ﬁtting
the synthetic wireframe structure (in green) using GCS model to a pair of COR-1 images for the CME observed on
2012-11-09 at 01:00:00 UT. To quantify how well we have ﬁtted the model in reproducing the overall structure, the
uncertainty in ﬁtting is found by outlining a hand drawn contour on the stereoscopic pair of images (an automatic
optimizer is further used to reﬁne this ﬁt) and then a comparison is done between the hand drawn contour and the
binary contour of the projected wireframe structure of the model (for details refer Thernisien et al. (2009)). This whole
process is repeated iteratively for a time sequence of images in the COR-1 and COR-2 ﬁeld of view and the evolution
of each of the parameters is recorded. In this context, Thernisien et al. (2009) reported that for some cases, it is not
possible to determine the complete ﬂux-rope orientation from observation from two vantage points (in particular for
periods in which STEREO-A and STEREO-B are in/close to opposition.), use of a third vantage point will help in a
better 3D reconstruction (also refer Balmaceda et al. (2018b)). In this regard, use of LASCO images can help in better
constraining the parameters. But, since we want to study the evolution of CME in the inner corona, and LASCO C2
FOV starts from 2 R(cid:12), we will be able to use LASCO only beyond 2 R(cid:12), and below this height we have to use COR-1
only. Thus, to keep consistency throughout our analysis, we didn’t use LASCO data in this work.

2.4. Methods of the estimation of 3D kinematical properties

After ﬁtting the GCS model to a time sequence of images of COR-1 and COR-2, the ﬁtted parameters are recorded.
The height time data is ﬁtted with a cubic smooth spline (red curve in top panel of Figure 2). A R-based procedure
“smooth.spline.R” (R Core Team 2018) is used to perform cubic smooth spline ﬁtting. In this method, the number of
nodes are supplied by the user, and the ﬁtting function then decides on the position of the nodes, thus dividing the
entire height time data into those many segments. We choose on average, six to ten nodes to characterise the spline,
depending on the number of data points present in each event, thus if the number of data points were less, then the
number of nodes was reduced to 6 or 7, such that the diﬀerent phases of evolution can be captured. The speed and
acceleration are calculated by the ﬁrst and second order numerical diﬀerentiation of the height time data. The speed
and acceleration proﬁle (red curve in second and third panel) is similarly obtained by the numerical diﬀerentiation of
the ﬁtted height time smooth spline function. We also plot an inset with a zoom into the residual acceleration phase
in the bottom corner of the panel displaying acceleration.
The grey band around the red curve in the top panel denotes the uncertainty in the ﬁtted parameter which is estimated

6

Majumdar et al.

by computing the uncertainty in the ﬁtting of the GCS model to the pair of observed images. The uncertainty in
ﬁtting is found by outlining a hand drawn contour on the stereoscopic pair of images (an automatic optimizer is
further used to reﬁne this ﬁt) and then a comparison is done between the hand drawn contour and the binary contour
of the projected wireframe structure of the ﬁtted model (for details refer Thernisien et al. (2009) ). This procedure
is repeated several times on several images and the average uncertainty was found to be 20%. Thus the grey band
denotes the 20% uncertainty region.

In section 3.5, we study the acceleration magnitude and acceleration duration of the CMEs. The acceleration
phase is determined from the velocity proﬁles. We identify the starting time of acceleration (when the velocity starts
changing) and the ending time of acceleration (when the velocity reaches the highest value and then becomes constant
or decelerates from thereupon), from which we estimate the duration of the acceleration. The acceleration magnitude is
then calculated (as reported by Zhang & Dere (2006)) as the increase in velocity divided by the acceleration duration.
The uncertainty in the duration of the acceleration is due to the cadences of COR-1 and COR-2. The uncertainties in
height measurements (as mentioned earlier) and the time interval (from cadence of COR 1 and COR 2) are used to
compute the uncertainty in magnitude of the acceleration. Since the uncertainty of velocity change, and acceleration
duration is inherited into the uncertainty of acceleration magnitude, the uncertainty is higher for impulsive events, and
smaller for gradual events (also reported by Zhang & Dere (2006)). Apart from the image cadence, uncertainty in the
acceleration phase can come from the inconsistencies of the CME leading edge as measured in diﬀerent wavelengths
(EUV and white light), and from the change in intensity over the FOV of a single instrument (Temmer et al. 2010).
As we have mentioned earlier, we have not used EUV data with white light data, to remove such inconsistencies in the
measurement of the leading edge in diﬀerent wavelengths. We cannot rule out the acceleration below COR-1 FOV,
and in such cases, the measurement of the duration of the acceleration phase would be an under estimate. However,
including EUV data will be tricky since we do not know if the structures seen in EUV map to the same features
observed in white-light. Thus we conﬁned the analysis to white light only.

3. RESULTS

The details of the GCS ﬁtting is presented in Table 1 with all ﬁtting parameters at the time when the CME leading
front is well developed in the COR-1 FOV. The third column speciﬁes the identiﬁed source region of the CMEs. In
case of events where both the view points gave an edge-on view of the CME, in those cases, we have an ice cream cone
shape, which is reproduced by the model by setting α to zero, and in such cases we put a ‘−’ in the column for γ in
Table 1. Diﬀerent physical parameters of the model provide physical insights on their evolution. A change in the GCS
latitude, or longitude is generally interpreted as true deﬂection, a change in γ is generally interpreted as rotation as
the CME propagates into the heliosphere, and a change in the half-angle can be interpreted as true 3D expansion of
the CME (Thernisien et al. 2009; Bosman et al. 2012)
Once we record parameters of CME for a time series during the CME evolution through COR-1 and COR-2 FOV, we
explore the physics conveyed by these parameters and their impacts on the evolution of CMEs through the inner and
outer corona.

Majumdar et al.

3.1. Connecting Width to the 3D Kinematics

Since we aim to understand the 3D evolution of CMEs in the inner and outer corona, in this section we explore the
3D kinematic proﬁles of them. Of the three forces (Lorentz force, viscous drag force and gravitational force), that
govern the dynamics of CMEs, since Lorentz force is the main driving force in the initial eruption process (Kliem
et al. 2014; Isenberg & Forbes 2007) that leads to the initial translation and expansion of the CME (Subramanian
et al. 2014), we connect here the true width evolution of CMEs to their 3D kinematic proﬁles. Figure 2, shows the
kinematic proﬁles of four diﬀerent CMEs out of which (a) and (b) are two slow CMEs and the other two are fast ones
based on their speeds recorded in CDAW catalogue. Every panel further contain four subplots. From the top, the
ﬁrst panel shows the height-time curve of the CMEs derived using GCS model ﬁtting on COR-1 and COR-2. The
height-time data is ﬁtted with a cubic smooth spline which has an additional advantage of choosing the number and
position of nodes. This provides the advantage of capturing the diﬀerent stages of evolution in the kinematic proﬁles
such as the initial impulsive phase, the gradual acceleration phase because the acceleration of a CME does not remain
constant but changes with height (Vrˇsnak et al. 2007). For the ﬁtting, we choose on average from six to ten knots to
characterise the spline. A similar ﬁtting procedure was adopted by Mierla et al. (2013) and Bein et al. (2011). The
uncertainty in ﬁtting due to the uncertainty in the ﬁtted model parameters (refer Section 2) is shown by the light grey
shaded region around the ﬁtted spline in red (Figure 2). We use only white light data for the study of kinematics so
as to ensure that we are tracking the same physical feature in the FOV of diﬀerent instruments. The second and third
panels from the top show the variation of the speed and acceleration with time derived by numerical diﬀerentiation
of the height and velocity, respectively. To understand the nature of variation of the width of CMEs, in the bottom
panel, we plot the evolution of the half-angle of the CME, which signiﬁes the width of the CME. We also show the
height axis on top for a better understanding. Figure 2(a) shows a slow CME coming from AP on April 2, 2011.
The second and third panels show that the CME experienced an initial impulsive acceleration which accelerated the
CME to a high speed and then it got decelerated, with the speed eventually slowing down and becoming constant at
a smaller speed. Such increase and then decrease in speed of a CME hints towards the drag experienced by the CME
due to the solar wind, which reduces the speed to a lesser value and the CME propagates with that constant speed
as reported by Gopalswamy et al. (2000). The acceleration also shows a similar nature of variation, with a sudden
initial impulsive phase and then almost vanishes for the later part of the propagation phase. The expansion of the
CME shown in the fourth panel shows that the CME expand during its initial evolution and then propagated with a
constant width beyond 2.57 R(cid:12). Figure 2(b) shows a similar behaviour, but the speed after attaining a higher value,
became constant at that value, without showing much signs of further deceleration. A similar behaviour is seen for
panels (c) and (d) of Figure 2. Similar proﬁles were also reported by Bein et al. (2011), in this work we report on true
speed and acceleration proﬁles.

It is understood that the viscous drag force dominates over other forces at the higher heights (Sachdeva et al. 2015),
and the CME is expected to have a constant speed proﬁle with little or no acceleration (also refer Webb & Howard
2012). Thus, we plot a blue dotted vertical line on the acceleration plot corresponding to the height where the initial
impulsive acceleration vanishes. We also draw a similar vertical line on the width evolution plot, where the width is
becoming constant there upon. A comparison of these two heights (the height at which impulsive acceleration vanishes
and the height at which the width becomes constant) will tell us the height till which the Lorentz force leaves its
imprint on the kinematic proﬁles of the evolution of CME from the inner corona, to the heliosphere. For event (a), the
acceleration drops down at 3.28 R(cid:12), while the width becomes constant at 2.57R(cid:12). Similarly, the respective heights
for events (b), (c) and (d) are (2.25 R(cid:12), 2.02 R(cid:12)), (2.52 R(cid:12), 4.06 R(cid:12)) and (3.81 R(cid:12), 2.82 R(cid:12)) respectively. We note
that the heights of vanishing impulsive acceleration and expansion are similar for events (a), (b) and (d), while there
is a reasonable diﬀerence in the two heights for event (c), where we ﬁnd that despite the initial acceleration ceasing at
2.52R(cid:12), the CMEs show expansion till 4.06R(cid:12). We do not understand the reason yet for the diﬀerence in the heights
in event (c) and a detailed analysis is needed for a better understanding.

Thus, in the 3D kinematic proﬁles, we ﬁnd that CMEs ﬁrst experience impulsive acceleration, followed by a gradual
acceleration and ﬁnally a little or no acceleration, conﬁrming early works from a single vantage point (Zhang et al.
2001; Zhang et al. 2004; Bein et al. 2011). It is also evident that the average values of diﬀerent kinematic parameters
like speed, width, acceleration fail to provide insights about the complete nature of variation and hence can be
misleading. Motivated by the varied width evolution, and the connection between width expansion and vanishing
impulsive acceleration, we study the evolution of true width of CMEs and the impact of Lorentz force on the kinematics.

We study the evolution of true widths of CMEs in inner and outer corona and then further connect the true widths
of CMEs to their true accelerations to have a better understanding of the impact of Lorentz force on their 3D evolution
close to their initiation heights. Using the ﬁtted GCS model parameters, we select the CMEs which showed a change
in their half-angle as they propagated outwards. In Figure 3(a), we plot the change in half-angle of the CMEs which
show a change of more than 10 degrees of their initial half-angle (α). A change in α exhibits expansion of CMEs
(Thernisien et al. 2009) and we found that in 27 % (16 out of 59) cases, CMEs showed true expansion ( 12 % (7 out
of 59) of those showed more than 10 degrees of expansion, refer Figure 3(a)). We see that some CMEs show initial
rapid increase in width and then a subsequent saturation, whereas, some cases show a very gradual increase in the
width and then it becoming constant. The expansion of the CMEs in most of the cases is found to saturate before
4 R(cid:12), whereas, in a few cases the CMEs keep on expanding till 8 R(cid:12). Thus we ﬁnd a wide range of heights where
the width of the CME attains a constant value. Since, the Lorentz force leads to the impulsive acceleration and their
expansion in the inner corona, we selected the events which showed impulsive acceleration and 3D expansion in their
kinematic proﬁles (refer Figure 2). In Figure 3(b), we plot the histogram distribution of the heights where the widths
become constant (in blue) and the distribution of heights where the impulsive acceleration of the CME vanishes (in
red). We ﬁnd that both the distributions have a well overlapping height ranges, while the distribution of heights of
constant width has a wider spread than that of the heights of vanishing impulsive acceleration. We ﬁnd that for most
of the CMEs, the width became constant in the height range of 2.5 − 3 R(cid:12). This is in agreement with the results of
Cremades et al. (2020) who reported that the width of the CMEs changed considerably below 3 R(cid:12). We also note
from panel (b) that the mode of both the distributions fall in the overlapping height range of 2.5 − 3 R(cid:12). This tells us
that for most events, the vanishing of initial impulsive acceleration and the constancy of width happens in this height
range. Thus, this is the height range till which the impact of Lorentz force remains evident in the kinematic proﬁles
on the initial evolution of CMEs. This is also in agreement with the results of Sachdeva et al. (2017) who reported
that Lorentz forces peaked in the height range of 1.65 − 2.45 R(cid:12) in the evolution of CMEs.

3.2. Aﬃnity for the equator - 3D Deﬂection of CMEs

We investigate whether or not CMEs show any signatures of deﬂection from a radial path of propagation. We ﬁrst
look into the latitude distribution (refer top panel of Figure 4(a)) of the source regions of the CMEs. We can see that
it shows a bi-modal distribution with the peaks of the distribution lying in the latitude range of ± 10◦ − 30◦, which

led us to believe that most of the source regions were associated with ARs (Murray et al. 2018), which in our case are
either ARs or APs. In the bottom panel of the same ﬁgure, we convert the central Position Angle (PA) of the leading

PA equivalent latitude. Unlike the case for the bi-modal distribution of source location latitudes, for the CMEs we
ﬁnd a broad distribution with a distinct peak around the equator. This tells us that a majority of the CMEs while
ejecting, got deﬂected towards the equator. Similar signature was also reported by Gopalswamy et al. (2003) as they
found CMEs originating from prominences got predominantly deﬂected towards equator from the latitude distribution
of prominences and that of the CMEs. However, the latitude distribution in that study suﬀers from the projection
in the plane of the sky. To check whether the deﬂections (from Figure 4(a)) were actual deﬂections suﬀered by the
CMEs, we look into the GCS latitude of all the events. We plot in (b) the distribution of initial GCS latitude (top),
and ﬁnal GCS latitude (bottom). In this case we do not ﬁnd such change in the latitude distribution as we ﬁnd in
(a). We ﬁnd that the distribution remains bi-modal. To further look into this, we plot the ﬁnal versus initial GCS
latitude. The solid line is the boundary where both the initial and ﬁnal latitudes are equal, and hence the points lying
on this line denotes CMEs which did not get deﬂected. The dotted line marks the equator. The data points lying to
the left of the vertical dotted line denote CMEs with initial latitude in Southern hemisphere. In this region, the points
lying above the solid line shows events for which the ﬁnal latitude is greater than the initial latitude, and thus denote
equator-ward deﬂection, and vice versa in the region to the right of the vertical dotted line. As we see from the ﬁgure,
we do ﬁnd that most of the CMEs which suﬀer deﬂections, get deﬂected towards the equator. But in most of these
cases, the angle of deﬂections are small, and hence a distribution of GCS latitude does not show a single mode around
the equator. From this, we ﬁnd that the apparent deﬂection as found from the latitude v/s PA equivalent latitude plot
is not a conclusive proof of deﬂection of CMEs, as the actual deﬂection suﬀered (as measured from gcs lat) is much
lesser. Due to the uncertainty in the model ﬁtting (∼ 20%), in Figure 4(d), we plot the variation of GCS latitude with
height for only those cases which showed deﬂection greater than 10 degrees. In this case too, we ﬁnd that most of the
CMEs get deﬂected towards the equator irrespective of their location being in the northern or southern hemisphere.
In this context, Gopalswamy et al. (2009), Kahler et al. (2012) reported that CMEs can get get deﬂected from their
initial path when they get ejected near a coronal hole. In our sample of events, using the data from AIA and EUVI,
we found that for all the events that show large deﬂections (> 10 degrees) coronal hole was present near their location.
We used the JHelioviewer software (Muller et al. 2009; M¨uller et al. 2017) and the data from SDO/AIA 193 ˚A and
STEREO/EUVI 195 ˚A and identiﬁed the location of the coronal holes near the source regions of the deﬂected CMEs.
With the coordinates of the coronal holes provided by the Jhelioviewer, we found that on an average the coronal holes
are located within 17◦ of latitude of the eruption. Kay et al. (2015) reported that such interaction of CMEs with the
open ﬁeld lines of coronal holes guides the CMEs towards the heliospheric current sheet. Further, we also found that
ﬁve events plotted in Figure 4(a) have either active or quiet prominences (or ﬁlaments) as their source regions. This
is also supported by the reports on non-radial ejections of CMEs from prominences with majority of them getting
deﬂected towards the equator by Gopalswamy et al. (2003).

Thus we ﬁnd that, ﬁrst, the CMEs propagate in a non-radial path from their source region, and most of them got
deﬂected towards the equator . This initial deﬂection towards the equator was also sustained in some cases (refer
Figure 4(a) and 4(b)) where the CMEs continued getting deﬂected further towards the equator as it propagated into
the outer corona. We found true deﬂection in 31 % (18 out of 59) cases ( 9 % (5 out of 59) of those showed more
than 10 degrees of deﬂection). We found the average height till which CMEs got deﬂected around 3.35 R(cid:12). These
deﬂections are also very crucial from the perspective that they provide an indirect evidence of the CMEs exhibiting
interactions with ambient coronal structures like coronal holes and can largely aﬀect height-time measurement in 2-D
images, giving spurious results. Thus, although from the latitude v/s PA equivalent latitude plot (Figure 4(a)), we
ﬁnd the CMEs to be apparently getting deﬂected towards the equator, from the distribution of GCS latitudes (Figure
4(b)), we do not ﬁnd such strong signatures of equator-ward deﬂection. Although, we still ﬁnd from Figure 4(c) that
majority of the deﬂected CMEs get deﬂected towards the equator, yet for only for 5 cases we ﬁnd the angle of deﬂection
is greater than 10 degrees. Thus we conclude that from our analysis, we do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant statistical deﬂection,
as expected from earlier works (Gopalswamy et al. 2003), and thus Figure 4 (a) does not provide a conclusive evidence
of deﬂection of CMEs, as the numbers largely suﬀer from projection eﬀects. Further extending this study on a larger
data set with actual 3-D values will help establish our conclusions better.

Since our events are selected from the CDAW catalogue, it is worthwhile to compare results that we have obtained
applying GCS model with those already catalogued using 2-D studies. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the average 3D speed of all the

speeds as calculated using the GCS model. The dashed line is the boundary where both the 2-D and 3D speeds are equal.

CMEs as estimated using the GCS model. We ﬁnd a wide range in the average true speeds from 213 km s−1 to 1492
km s−1. The CMEs were segregated into slow and fast based on their average 2-D speed as quoted in the CDAW
catalogue. In Figure 5 we plot the average true speed versus the average projected speed for slow and fast CMEs.
Each data point represent the average speed of one single event. The dashed line is the boundary where both the
projected and true speeds are equal. In case of the slow CMEs, we ﬁnd that, almost all the true speeds are higher
than the projected speeds, which is expected. We thus ﬁnd that a good fraction (∼ 52%) (15 out of 29) of the slow
CMEs (< 400 km s−1 in CDAW catalogue) have higher true speeds. In the case of fast CMEs, we ﬁnd a good fraction
(∼ 63%) (19 out of 30) of the events showing 2-D speeds higher than 3D speeds. This contradicts our intuition. Shen
et al. (2013a) reported several reasons for this discrepancy. The GCS model does a 3D ﬁtting of the leading front of
the CME, whereas speeds in the CDAW catalogue is calculated by tracking the part of the leading edge which move
with the highest speed (which may be a part of the shock front of the CME). We also note that the projected speeds
are higher than the true speeds mostly for the fast CMEs which are capable of driving shocks. We also found that
all these fast CMEs with projected speeds higher than true speeds were marked as partial-halo events in the CDAW
catalogue. In this context, Gopalswamy et al. (2009) and Shen et al. (2013b) reported that the lateral expansion speed
might be greater than the radial propagation speed, and in the projected image, especially for halo or partial halo
CMEs, it is diﬃcult to distinguish between the two. Thus, for such events which are halo or partial-halo with respect
to one viewing point, it is important to study their kinematics by performing a 3D reconstruction with images taken
from more than one vantage point and then ﬁnd their true propagation speed and not their lateral expansion speed.
Further, diﬀerent values of solar wind speed at diﬀerent latitudes can have diﬀerent imprints on diﬀerent parts of the
CME leading edge, which will also inﬂuence the results of CDAW catalogue (as they track one single point on the
leading edge). But the GCS model ﬁts the leading front completely and hence this eﬀect will be much lesser. We also
note from Figure 2 that the average values fail to provide the complete picture of the kinematics and hence can be
misleading.

In Figure 6(a) we plot the distribution of peak 3D speeds (Vpeak) for all the 59 CMEs studied in this work. We ﬁnd
a wide range for Vpeak from 396 to 2465 km s−1 with a mean value of 984 km s−1, and the peak of the distribution

being in the range 600 to 800 km s−1. Bein et al. (2011) reported a range for Vpeak from 56 to 1279 km s−1 with a
mean value of 526 km s−1 and mode lying in the range 300 to 400 km s−1 for 95 events during 2007 to 2010 which
was during the solar minimum of cycle 23. Vrˇsnak et al. (2007) studied 22 events during 2002 to 2005 which was the
maximum and decay phase of cycle 23 and found Vpeak to range between 365 to 2775 km s−1 with a mean value of 940
km s−1. We ﬁnd our results are similar to the results of Vrˇsnak et al. (2007) and our events were selected during 2007
to 2014 which includes cycle 23 minimum, cycle 24 rising phase and maximum with a majority of the events (∼ 69%)
coming from cycle 24 maximum, and further, the speeds in our work are the true peak speeds. Bein et al. (2011)
reported on a long tail of the distribution of Vpeak towards high velocities. We also ﬁnd a similar trend in our result
(Figure 6(a)) and since we have the information of the source region, we wanted to look at the contribution of the
CMEs coming from the diﬀerent source region to this distribution. In panel (b), we plot the peak speed distribution
but for the CMEs segregated on the basis of their source regions. We ﬁnd that the tail of the distribution towards high
velocities is contributed by the CMEs coming from ARs and APs. We also note that the mode of the distribution is
the same for CMEs coming from ARs and APs (800 to 1200 km s−1), while for CMEs from PEs it is between 400 to
800 km s−1, which further implies that the CMEs from ARs and APs tend to have higher peak speeds than the ones
from PEs. In this regard, we also found that most of the CMEs (42 %) (25 out of 59) reached their true peak speeds
below 5 R(cid:12).

We also plot the distribution of peak true acceleration (apeak) in Figure 7(a). We note that while the distribution of
Vpeak increases gradually to a peak and then decreases with a long tail, in case of apeak, the distribution falls oﬀ with
increasing acceleration, but with a similar tail towards higher values. We further ﬁnd an even wider range for apeak
from 176 to 10922 m s−2 with a mean value of 2387 m s−2 and the mode of the distribution lying in the range 1000 to
2000 m s−2. This is again higher than the range obtained by Bein et al. (2011) from 19 to 6781 m s−2 with a mean of
756 m s−2. whereas Vrˇsnak et al. (2007) reported a higher range from 40 to 7300 m s−2. Again to ﬁnd the contribution
of diﬀerent source regions to the peak acceleration distribution, we again plot the distribution separately for the three
diﬀerent sources in panel (b). We again ﬁnd that the high acceleration tail is coming from the CMEs which had either
ARs or APs as their source regions. Thus, based on the distribution of peak true speeds and accelerations, we ﬁnd
that the CMEs originating from ARs and APs are more energetic than the ones coming from PEs. This conclusion is
based on the speed and acceleration of these CMEs. The injected ﬂux in the ﬂux-rope is responsible for translating
the CMEs (Subramanian et al. 2014; Webb & Howard 2012) , and thus, according to our deﬁnition of ARs, and APs,
CMEs associated with AR and AP might have more ﬂux injection leading to strong accelerations. This could be
responsible for large speeds and accelerations. A detailed investigation needs to be done considering the magnetic ﬁeld
of the source region and the injected ﬂux to the CMEs to further quantify this statement.

3.5. Acceleration duration and acceleration magnitude

Since CME events can range from being extremely impulsive to extremely gradual based on their accelerations, a
study of the true acceleration duration and acceleration magnitude is important as they greatly aﬀect the speeds of
CMEs (Zhang & Dere 2006). Based on the 3D kinematic proﬁles (refer Figure 2), we were able to track the change
in velocity, thereby identifying the onset and ending time, and hence the acceleration duration. In Figure 8(a), we
plot the distribution of the acceleration duration in minutes. We ﬁnd a wide range in the acceleration duration from
10 minutes to 703 minutes with the peak of the distribution in the range of 100-150 minutes and the mean duration
being 153 minutes. Such wide range in acceleration duration was also reported by Zhang & Dere (2006), Vrˇsnak et al.
(2007) and Bein et al. (2011) with a mean duration of 180, 120 and 44.6 minutes respectively. We ﬁnd our average
acceleration duration to be in agreement with the results of Zhang & Dere (2006) and Vrˇsnak et al. (2007) while
Bein et al. (2011) suggested such a relatively lower value was due to the fact that majority of the events studied were
impulsive events. Since the acceleration magnitude is also important for understanding the kinematics, we further
found the acceleration magnitudes of all the CMEs. For this we followed a similar procedure as Zhang & Dere (2006),
who reported that the acceleration magnitude is the increase in velocity divided by the acceleration duration. The
uncertainty in the acceleration duration is determined by the observational cadences, and the same for acceleration
magnitude is inherited from the uncertainty in the acceleration duration and the velocity change (Zhang & Dere
(2006)). In Figure 8(b), we plot the acceleration magnitude versus acceleration duration. We ﬁnd a strong inverse
correlation between acceleration magnitude and acceleration duration, that is higher acceleration magnitudes have
shorter duration and vice versa. This inverse correlation can be described with the following relation:

log(A) = 4.35 − 1.19log(T ),

(2)

where A is the acceleration magnitude in m s−2 and T is the acceleration duration in minutes. The correlation
coeﬃcient is -0.88. Similar inverse correlation was also reported by Zhang & Dere (2006) (power law index -1.09),
Vrˇsnak et al. (2007) (power law index -1.14) and Bein et al. (2011) (power law index -1.09). We note from our results
that the scaling relation remains similar in 3D study. This thus shows that impulsive events tend to have stronger
acceleration for shorter duration while the gradual events tend to have weaker acceleration for longer duration. We
also note from panel (b) that the CMEs coming from PEs (in green data points) are distributed in the lower region of
the scatter plot, indicating that they are gradual events with weaker acceleration magnitude with longer acceleration
durations.

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we study the 3D evolution of Coronal Mass Ejections in the inner and outer corona originating from
diﬀerent source regions, which are Active Regions, Prominence Eruptions and Active Prominences. A total of 59
CMEs were studied, of which 29 CMEs were slow (< 400 km s−1) CMEs and 30 CMEs were categorised as fast
(> 400 km s−1) CMEs based on their recorded 2-D speeds in the CDAW catalogue. The source regions of all these
59 CMEs were identiﬁed. This helped us to connect the true kinematics of CMEs in 3D to the source regions they
are coming from. Multi-viewpoint coronal observations from the twin spacecraft STEREO A and STEREO B was
used for the 3D reconstruction of the CME morphology by using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model. The
data from COR-1 and COR-2 was used in tracking the CME for studying its kinematics. Table 1 shows the GCS
ﬁtting parameters of events we studied in this work. The table also lists alongside, the identiﬁed source region of these
CMEs and their average true and projected speeds. For CMEs which were observed edge-on (that gives an ice cream
cone shape appearance) from both the view points, we couldn’t determine the half-angle uniquely for them and as a
consequence, the tilt-angle for such events are kept zero as it has no meaning when the half-angle cannot be determined
(for details refer Thernisien et al. (2009)). This problem might be ﬁxed, if another vantage point of observation can
be used to ﬁt the model to the event. For example, LASCO C2 data can be used to address this issue. We conclude
our main results that we have discussed in diﬀerent sections of this paper as follows.

• We studied the true width evolution of CMEs in the inner and outer corona (refer Figure 3(a)), and found that
in 28 % cases, CMEs showed true expansion ( 12 % of those showed more than 10 degrees of expansion). We
also found that some of the width proﬁles showed an initial rapidly increasing phase and then a saturation, while
some events showed a gradually rising phase or a late rising phase and then a subsequent saturation. Another
important feature is that there was a wide range of heights (2.5 − 8 R(cid:12)) till which CMEs showed an increase
in its width. Since, Lorentz force drives the initial rapid acceleration of the CME and is also responsible for
the expansion, we plotted the distribution of heights where the width became constant and the heights where
the initial impulsive acceleration vanished (Figure 3(b)). We found that both the distributions peaked at an
overlapping height range of 2.5 − 3 R(cid:12). Thus, we believe that the eﬀect of Lorentz force remained dominant in
the initial phase of evolution till a height range of 2.5 − 3 R(cid:12). In this regard, we note that Patsourakos et al.
(2010) tracked a circular bubble shaped cavity of a CME using the GCS model, but with a further constraint
that the legs of the model being co incident (that is alpha being 0, giving the ice cream cone shape). They
studied the timing of bubble expansion and acceleration and its relation to the associated ﬂare, and they do not
talk about the height of inﬂuence of Lorentz force. In this work, we do not put any such constraints on the model
parameters, and we further statistically ﬁnd the height of inﬂuence of Lorentz force on the evolution of CMEs,
by connecting width evolution and acceleration proﬁle. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst time the observational
impact of Lorentz force on CME kinematics is statistically shown by connecting true width evolution to the true
acceleration proﬁle using the GCS model.

• We found latitudinal deﬂection suﬀered by a subset of the events we have studied (Figures 4(a), (b), (c) and
(d),). We found true deﬂection in 31 % (18 out of 59) cases ( 9 % (5 out of 59) of those showed more than 10
degrees of deﬂection). A distribution of the latitudinal location of the source regions of these CMEs and of the
PA of the CME leading edge converted to equivalent latitude showed that the most of the CMEs propagated
non-radially and a majority of them apparently getting deﬂected towards the equator. But a distribution of
the initial and ﬁnal GCS latitudes did not show such strong signatures of equator-ward deﬂection. From the
plot of ﬁnal versus initial GCS latitude, we do ﬁnd most of the CMEs showing deﬂections towards the equator,
but the angle of deﬂection being small in most cases as mentioned earlier. Thus we conclude that the latitude
versus PA equivalent latitude plot does not provide a conclusive evidence of deﬂection of CMEs, as the numbers
largely suﬀer from projection eﬀects, and a study with the true numbers (the true latitudes found from 3D
reconstruction) give a better understanding. A plot of the change in latitude of the CMEs from the GCS model
ﬁtting (refer Figure 4(b)), further showed that most of the CMEs got deﬂected towards the equator. The presence
of coronal holes results in CMEs getting deﬂected and in our case too, coronal holes were found near the CMEs
which were deﬂected by more than 10 degrees. Kay et al. (2015) reported that such interaction of CMEs with
the open ﬁeld lines of coronal holes guides the CMEs towards the heliospheric current sheet. Such equator-ward
deﬂection of fast CMEs can be potential indicators of strong Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events happening at
1 AU (Kahler et al. 2012), as such CME and coronal hole interactions indicate a possible interaction between the
coronal hole magnetic ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld of the CME, producing driverless shocks at 1 AU, capable of
producing SEP events. Driverless shocks are the shocks at 1 AU which do not accompany any in-situ observation
of the associated interplanetary CME drivers (for details, please refer Gopalswamy et al. (2010)). Since we ﬁnd
only 5 cases which show strong equator-ward deﬂection, extending this study on a larger data set will help in
conﬁrming our conclusions.

• We found the peak 3D speeds of CMEs ranging between 396 to 2465 km s−1 with a mean value of 984 km s−1,
mode lying in the range 600 to 800 km s−1 and the peak 3D acceleration having an even wider range from 176
to 10922 m s−2 with a mean value of 2387 m s−2 and mode lying in the range 1000 to 2000 m s−2. We further
found that the distribution of Vpeak and apeak showed a long tail towards high speeds and accelerations and this
contribution to high values came from CMEs which had either ARs or APs as their source regions, thus showing
that such CMEs are more energetic than the ones originating from PEs. This conclusion is based on the speed
and acceleration of these CMEs. A detailed investigation needs to be done considering the magnetic ﬁeld of the
source region and the injected ﬂux to the CMEs to further quantify.

• We studied the distribution of acceleration duration of CMEs and found a wide range from 10 minutes to
703 minutes with the peak of the distribution in the range of 100-150 minutes and the mean duration being 153
minutes. We also plotted the true acceleration magnitude versus acceleration duration and found a strong inverse

20

Majumdar et al.

correlation (correlation coeﬃcient -0.88) between them with a power law index of -1.19, implying that stronger
acceleration magnitudes have shorter acceleration duration. Further by comparing our result with previous
results by Zhang & Dere (2006), Bein et al. (2011) and Vrˇsnak et al. (2007), we found that this scaling relation
between acceleration magnitude and acceleration duration remains similar in 3-D. Furthermore, we noted that
the CMEs from PEs were mostly gradual events with weaker accelerations and longer acceleration duration.
We also note that there would be acceleration below COR-1 FOV, and in such cases, the measurement of the
acceleration phase would be an under estimate. But including EUV (to capture the acceleration below COR-1
FOV) will be tricky since we do not know if the structures seen in EUV map to the same features observed in
white-light. Thus we conﬁned the analysis to white light only. This can be done in future using data from Solar
Orbiter (M¨uller et al. 2013), PROBA-3 (Renotte et al. 2014) and ADITYA L1 (Seetha & Megala 2017; Prasad
et al. 2017), which will observe the inner corona.

• We compared the average values of true speeds and projected speeds in Figure 5. The average true speeds showed
a wide range from 213 km s−1 to 1492 km s−1. We found that for almost all the slow CMEs, the 3D values
are higher than the projected 2-D values. However, for the fast CMEs, a large fraction of the CMEs (∼ 63%,
(19 out of 30)) showed projected speeds greater than the actual 3D speeds. Thus we see a striking dissimilarity
in the comparison of speeds for slow and fast CMEs. These fast CMEs were marked as partial-halo CMEs in
the CDAW catalogue. A 3D reconstruction from multi-view points where the CME was non-halo gives the true
picture with their true speeds. We also remind here that the method of tracking the CME height is diﬀerent in
our case and the one used in the LASCO images for the catalogue. One of the principal aim of studying CME
kinematics is to calculate their arrival times at Earth, and it is clear from here that for the slow CMEs, the
projected speeds will give a wrong estimation of the predicted arrival times. These considerations are important
for better arrival time predictions with the true 3D speed for halo CMEs and not with the misleading projected
speed which for halo CMEs might be the lateral expansion speed instead of the radial propagation speed.

We believe that this study will help us to understand and connect the true width evolution of CMEs in the inner
corona, and the presence of impulsive acceleration in the 3D kinematic proﬁles will provide important inputs to CME
ejection models. Comparison of projected and true speeds showed the importance of studying kinematics in 3D. We
also point out that extending this work on a larger data set will help in conﬁrming our conclusions. It is also worth
noting that the future solar missions, like ADITYA-L1 (Seetha & Megala 2017; Prasad et al. 2017), PROBA-3 (Renotte
et al. 2014) and the recently launched Solar Orbiter (M¨uller et al. 2013) have coronagraphs that will be observing
the inner corona. This work will provide essential inputs to plan the observing campaigns of these missions and the
data from these missions can be incorporated to extract more information on the kinematics of CMEs close to their
initiation heights.
