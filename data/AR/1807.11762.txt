Coherent control makes use of the quantum interfer-
ence of diﬀerent pathways to control the outcome of a
physical process [1]. As a quantum interference eﬀect it is
exquisitely sensitive to the requirement of pathway indis-
tinguishably. This condition presents a major challenge
for the control of bimolecular collisions, which requires
entanglement of internal vibrational and external transla-
tional degrees of freedom for quantum interference to oc-
cur [2–5]. However, there are two classes of processes for
which these obstacles were conceptually overcome: the
A2 + B2 [1, 4], as well
tetra-atomic reaction AB + AB
as Penning (PI) and Associative ionization (AI) [6, 7].
The control of the PI and AI is extremely important in,
e.g., the formation of Bose-Einstein condensates, since
the ionization leads to losses in the trap [8]. The PI and
AI are also important in the spectroscopy of surfaces [9],
plasma chemistry [10, 11] or atmospheric studies [12].
Similarly, control of AB + AB would eliminate undesired
chemical reactions in ultracold gases [13].

Although bond making has been demonstrated [14, 15],
to date there has been no experimental demonstration of
quantum interference controlled reactive collisional pro-
cesses. However, experimental technology in the control
and study of interatomic collisions has seen tremendous
progress in recent years. In particular, advances in the
control of ultracold atoms and molecules allows for a pre-
cise preparation and investigation of diﬀerent collision
scenarios [16–19] – including PI at 10mK [20]. In addi-
tion, the use of additional optical and static ﬁelds en-
ables one to study the stereodynamics of the collisional
processes [21]. Very recently this ansatz has been used to
obtain the branching ratio of PI and AI in the collision
of Ne∗(3P2)+Ar(1S) [22, 23] Kr, Xe and N2 [24], resolved
for diﬀerent initial incident angles. In light of these recent
developments in experimental techniques and the absence
of experimental demonstrations of collisional control, a
reexamination of coherent control approaches in colli-
sional processes is strongly motivated.

This letter provides a viable method for the coher-
ent control of Penning and Associative ionization as an
example of the interference-based control of collisional
processes. In addition to doing so we also resolve cru-
cial symmetry issues that were inadvertently neglected in
prior work [6, 7]. Resolving these issues also oﬀers consid-

erable insight into conditions for interference in angular
momentum controlled processes of interest here.

In Penning and Associative ionization (reviewed
in [25]) two atoms A and B collide - with at least one
(here B) being initially in a metastable state B∗ –, lead-
ing to ionization:

(1b)
In the Penning mechanism, the metastable species B∗ re-
laxes to its ground state while the other atom becomes
ionized. In AI, on the other hand, an ionic dimer (AB)+
is formed. In both cases an electron is ejected. In gen-
eral, PI and AI can decay to the same molecular channel,
where a bound (AI) or a continuum state (PI) is formed.
The initial state of the colliding atoms may be written

does not depend on the azimuthal angle, ϕ, that is, the
orbital magnetic quantum number is MN = 0, so that,
before the collision, the total magnetic quantum number
of the A-B∗ system is MJ = MN +MA+MB = MA+MB.
Further, the Hamiltonian H commutes with rotations
around any axis of the LFF, and in particular around
the Z-axis, i.e., [H, JZ ] = 0. Thus MJ = MA + MB is
a good quantum number, implying that the ﬁnal state,

any symmetry that is conserved by ˆW , these cross terms

symmetry [27]. For example, for the case of coherent
control of collisional processes in the absence of an ex-
ternal, time-dependent ﬁeld, the energy as a conserved
quantity leads to the constraint that the initial state has
to be a linear superposition of energetically degenerate
states. In past proposals for coherent control of the AI
and PI cross sections, this constraint was taken into ac-
count by choosing a metastable state with non-zero an-
gular momentum J, and using the degenerate states of
diﬀerent magnetic quantum number MJ to construct the
superposition state [6, 7]. However, as will be shown in
the following, this may not be suﬃcient since we must
also properly take into account the invariance of the col-
lisional cross section under rotations in the LFF.

Speciﬁcally, in the absence of an external ﬁeld, the
collision process is invariant with respect to any rotation
of the LFF. Consider then the collision between atoms
A and B, and deﬁne the Z axis of the LFF by the di-
rectional vector of the relative momentum ~k at t
.
→ −∞
Furthermore assume that the atoms A and B are initially
in states with well-deﬁned magnetic quantum numbers
MA and MB, which are the projection of each atom’s
electronic angular momentum on the Z-axis. The initial
state then reads

B , which is the same condition on the con-
servation of the total magnetic quantum number stated
above. Note that this condition is based on symmetry
operations in the LFF, and is independent of the inter-
action between the atoms. It is therefore generic for any
bimolecular collision using degenerate magnetic states for
coherent control. This rotational symmetry perspective
allows a simple principle to aid in formulating eﬀective
control scenarios. Speciﬁcally, any coherent control sce-
nario must rely on initial states that are anisotropic with
respect to rotations in the LFF.

scribes incoherent control via the population, and ξ co-
herent control via the relative phase. Typical results at
50 mK are shown in Fig. 1 and the cross sections σΩ for
each Ω are collected in Table I. Evident is the extensive
control of PI or AI as a function of η and ξ. For example,
the cross section for AI can be varied by means of η and
ξ from 400 to 1700 a.u., i. e., by a factor of over 4. (This
control is reduced to a factor of 2 if one only tunes the
relative phase ξ). Similar results are shown for control of
σPI. Interesting is that the functional dependence of σAI
and σPI on η, ξ are similar, so that control over the ra-
tio σAI/σPI is not as extensive (from 2.5 to 3.5). Hence,
one can control total ionization by η and ξ, an impor-
tant result, for example, for suppression of ionization in
a Bose-Einstein condensate [8].

In summary, we have introduced a viable means of con-
trolling, via quantum interference eﬀects, both Penning
and Associative ionization in atomic collisions. Symme-
try conditions were shown to provide insight into the se-
lection of initial states for which control is possible. The
axis of quantization along which superpositions of inter-
nal states is created was shown to be of particular im-

[27] Note that if the exit channel is not of a speciﬁc symmetry,
but a superposition of diﬀerent symmetries, it can couple
initial states of diﬀerent symmetry and non-zero cross
terms results. However, when calculating the total cross
section, and thus summing over all exit channels, the
cross terms cancel.

[33] This error resulted from the wrong treatment of the
branching ratios, WΩ→X , from an initial, Ω, to a ﬁnal
channel, X. This assumption lead to erroneous autoion-
ization widths ΓΩ(r) only dependent on the initial chan-
nel. In this work, the autoionization widths depend on
both the initial and the ﬁnal channel by means of the
branching ratios, ΓΩ→X (r) = ΓΩ(r)WΩ→X.
