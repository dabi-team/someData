puriﬁcation of the gaseous volume of the detector system using the XENON1T cryogenic
distillation column. A krypton-in-xenon concentration of (360 ± 60) ppq was achieved. It
is the lowest concentration measured in the ﬁducial volume of an operating dark matter
detector to date. A model was developed and ﬁt to the data to describe the krypton
evolution in the liquid and gas volumes of the detector system for several operation
modes over the time span of 550 days, including the commissioning and science runs of
XENON1T. The online distillation was also successfully applied to remove 37Ar after
its injection for a low energy calibration in XENON1T. This makes the usage of 37Ar as
a regular calibration source possible in the future. The online distillation can be applied
to next-generation LXe TPC experiments to remove krypton prior to, or during, any
science run. The model developed here allows further optimization of the distillation
strategy for future large scale detectors.

Introduction

1.
Intrinsic radioactive noble gas contaminants such as 85Kr and 222Rn are the main contrib-
utors to the background in today’s large scale liquid-xenon-based dark matter experiments
[1–5], as well as neutrinoless double beta decay experiments [6, 7]. Their removal is of
crucial importance for reaching the target sensitivities with growing demands on lowering
backgrounds. A well-established technology for this removal is the application of cryogenic
distillation columns that employ the diﬀerences in vapor pressure between the contaminant
and xenon. More volatile components such as krypton are enriched in the gaseous xenon
(GXe) phase, while less volatile constituents such as radon accumulate in the liquid xenon
(LXe) [8–12].

The isotope 85Kr is a β-emitter with an endpoint energy of 687 keV and a half-life of
10.76 yr. It is anthropogenically produced in uranium and plutonium ﬁssion and is released
in the atmosphere by nuclear weapon tests and nuclear reprocessing plants. The abundance
of 85Kr in natural krypton is typically reported to be 85Kr/natKr ∼ 10−11 [13]. Since xenon
is extracted from air by fractional distillation, a small portion of natural krypton is con-
tained within the xenon, typically at the level of ppm (10−6 mol/mol). Xenon with a lower
krypton concentration (natKr/Xe ∼10 ppb (10−9 mol/mol)) can be purchased from indus-
trial vendors. Current and future dark matter experiments require natural krypton-in-xenon
concentrations at the ppt (10−12 mol/mol) level or below [2]. Typically, it is assumed that
the release of krypton from the detector components is negligible. Therefore, it needs to be
removed from the xenon just once before the dark matter search. This removal is conven-
tionally done by oﬄine distillation or gas chromatography campaigns [3, 14] before the start
of an experiment, where both technologies are able to reach the required purity.

In the case of the XENON1T experiment, the detector was initially ﬁlled with about
3.2 tonnes of xenon without oﬄine krypton removal. After the veriﬁcation of the liquid
xenon time projection chamber (LXe TPC) functionality, a novel online krypton distillation

technique was developed using the existing XENON1T distillation column [10] to reduce the
krypton-in-xenon concentration while the detector was operated.

The same online distillation technique was applied to remove the more volatile noble
gas argon from xenon. The radioactive isotope 37Ar was introduced into the XENON1T
detector just before decommissioning for calibration purposes [15]. Its decay via electron
capture allowed the study of the detector response at low energies of 2.8 keV for K-shell
and 0.27 keV for L-shell transitions [16]. However, its half-life of 35.01 d is too long for it
to decay away in the scope of a dark matter search. A regular use is possible through the
active removal of the residual argon after the calibration via the online distillation of volatile
impurities.

The aforementioned new online distillation technique for argon and krypton is presented
in this paper. In section 2, the XENON1T detector system is summarized with a focus on
the involved systems for the online distillation. In section 3, a model is introduced in order
to describe the concentration evolution of the more volatile noble gases in the gaseous and
liquid xenon volumes of the detector for each operation mode. Section 4 describes the ﬁt of
the model to the krypton data obtained from the event rate inside the LXe TPC itself, as
well as from extracted xenon samples. Furthermore, the online removal of 37Ar is presented
in section 5. Section 6 gives a conclusion and outline for possible future applications of the
newly developed method.

2. Experimental setup

The XENON1T experiment (decommissioned in December 2018) was located underground
in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), Italy, and utilized a total of 3.2 tonnes
of xenon. The LXe TPC inside the cryostat enclosed about 2 tonnes, while the surrounding
1.2 tonnes were employed as a passive shield. The cryostat was placed inside a 10 m wide and
10 m tall water tank equipped with an active Cherenkov muon veto system [17], in order
to shield against environmental radioactivity and remaining cosmic radiation. A service
building next to the water tank hosted a cryogenic distillation column (DST), a puriﬁcation
(PUR) system, and a cryogenic (CRY) system, the relevant systems for this work. A complete
overview about the diﬀerent subsystems are summarized in Ref. [1].

The CRY system consists of three independent condensation towers as depicted in ﬁgure 1,
two equipped with redundant pulse tube refrigerators (PTRs) and one with liquid nitrogen
(LN2) cooling as backup. The system keeps the xenon temperature constant during data
taking. A double-walled vacuum insulated tube (cryopipe) connects the CRY system to the
cryostat to carry LXe to the cryostat after re-condensation. LXe is extracted and evaporated
from the cryostat via a tube-in-tube heat exchanger inside the cryopipe and the GXe pro-
duced is further warmed up with the help of two parallel-plate heat exchangers installed in
series. For simplicity, the series of heat exchangers is treated as one heat exchanger referred
to as HE. The HE outlet is subsequently guided to the PUR system. Most of the puriﬁed
GXe returns to the other side of this HE to liquefy the xenon again and feed it back into the
detector. A small gas fraction is guided directly into a diving bell system (omitted in ﬁgure
1) to regulate the liquid level inside the LXe TPC. Additionally, for puriﬁcation purposes, it
is possible to extract a fraction of the evaporating xenon from the cryostat at three diﬀerent
locations of the CRY system (feedthroughs, cryopipe, condensers) and send it to either the
DST or the PUR system before re-condensation.

Fig. 1: Online distillation scheme: The liquid (gaseous) xenon phase LXe (GXe) in the
cryostat contains the mass ML (MG) and a solute concentration of xL (xG). Diﬀerent con-
centrations in diﬀerent locations are denoted as xi with their respective xenon mass ﬂow
Fi. A constant solute particle ﬂow kS is entering the GXe volume to account for potential
internal out-gassing or external leaks. The global ﬂow path depends on the detector conﬁg-
uration applied as indicated by the diﬀerent colored lines. Details for each conﬁguration are
explained in section 3 and are summarized in table 1. In Conﬁguration 4 (gold), as example,
xenon is extracted from the LXe volume with (xL, FL) and from the GXe with (xG, FG).
The two ﬂows mix at the PUR inlet into (x1, F1). A fraction (x1, FD) is distilled with the
DST system and is returned with (xD, F (cid:48)
D) mixing back into (x2, F2) with a lower solute
concentration. From there, the ﬂow is split and a fraction (x3, F3) returns directly into the
GXe volume. The remaining ﬂow goes into the HE, where the xenon is partially liqueﬁed
due to the limited HE eﬃciency (cid:15)HE, and a ﬂow (x5, F5) goes into the LXe volume. The ﬂow
(x4, F4) stays gaseous and returns to the GXe volume. Note that in Conﬁguration 3 only
the black lines are relevant as no xenon is extracted for puriﬁcation.

The PUR system continuously recirculates xenon extracted from the CRY system to
remove electronegative impurities such as water and oxygen. These impurities can poten-
tially suppress the light and charge signals in the LXe TPC. The PUR system is divided
into two branches, each consisting of a high-purity pump, a ﬂow controller, as well as a gas
puriﬁer. Furthermore, the PUR system acts as a xenon gas distributor between diﬀerent

For a clearer visualization, the PUR system in ﬁgure 1 shows only the distribu-
tion lines relevant for this work. The DST system, designed to remove krypton from xenon,
consists of four key components, namely an input condenser, a package tube, a reboiler and
a top condenser. A scheme is shown in ﬁgure 2 along with a picture of the set-up in the
University of M¨unster before shipment to LNGS. The xenon enters the DST system with a
krypton concentration x1 and ﬂow FD and is partially liqueﬁed in the input condenser. From
there, GXe and LXe are fed into the package tube at diﬀerent heights. The reboiler at the
bottom contains a liquid xenon volume that is partially evaporated, while the top condenser
liqueﬁes again the up-going xenon gas. In this manner, a counter-ﬂow of up-going GXe and
down-going LXe is established along the surface of the package tube, so that more volatile
gases than xenon, such as argon or krypton, are enriched at the top and are depleted at the
bottom. Here, ultra-pure xenon with a krypton concentration xD can be extracted with a
ﬂow F (cid:48)
D, typically about 99 % of the feed ﬂow FD. At the top, a small xenon fraction of 1 %
of FD is extracted as krypton-enriched xenon oﬀgas (xO, FD − F (cid:48)
D) and is stored in bottles.
The oﬀgas is collected and distilled again in dedicated campaigns to minimize the xenon
losses. The DST system’s performance was determined by extracting samples during oﬄine
distillation campaigns, where xenon from bottles was distilled and ﬁlled into the XENON1T
storage system at the process speed of 72 kg/d. In one campaign, three bottles were measured
with a commercial gas-chromatograph yielding an average concentration of (453 ± 53) ppb.
For a fourth bottle, a certiﬁcate from the delivering company stated a concentration of less
than 1000 ppb of krypton. The puriﬁed outlet sample was measured to have a concentration
of (730 ± 140) ppq measured from an extracted sample at the PUR system. Assuming a uni-
form probability for the unknown concentration of the fourth bottle between 0 and 1000 ppb,
the reduction factor is (6.4+1.9
−1.4) × 105 between feed and bottom product. Absolute concen-
trations xD = natKr/Xe < 48 ppq (10−15 mol/mol) (90 % C.L.) were measured directly at the
DST system’s outlet when distilling xenon with input concentrations of about 50 ppb during
further oﬄine distillation runs. All details are presented in Ref. [10].

For the online distillation method, the cryostat in combination with the CRY system is
assumed to be a distillation-column-like system with an enrichment of more volatile noble gas
species in the detector’s GXe volume with respect to the LXe volume. In the following section,
the online distillation method is explained for the case of krypton, although the method is
applicable analogously to any noble gas species more volatile than xenon. The concept is
based on the continuous puriﬁcation of the GXe volume by the distillation column. This can
be achieved by extracting the krypton-enriched xenon gas via the ports of the CRY system
mentioned above. The krypton-free xenon from the DST system outlet returns to the PUR
system and from there, back into the detector. This operation disturbs the krypton particle
equilibrium between the LXe and GXe volumes, as the GXe volume now features a lower
krypton concentration. As a consequence, krypton particles from the LXe volume migrate
towards the GXe volume, from where they are removed again. Thus, a continuous krypton
migration from LXe to GXe volume is established. In this way, the total xenon inventory of
about 3.2 tonnes can be puriﬁed by continuously processing about 20 kg occupying the GXe
volume.

3. Online distillation model

In this section, an online distillation model is derived in order to describe the krypton
concentration evolution in the GXe as well as in the LXe volume inside the detector over
time. This paper covers a time span of 550 days from August 2016 until February 2018
including the commissioning phase, the ﬁrst (SR0) and the second science run (SR1) of
XENON1T [18]. For the online distillation model, the in-going and out-going krypton ﬂows
in both volumes are taken into account, leading to a coupled diﬀerential equation system
for a given detector conﬁguration. The model can be analogously applied for the removal of
any noble gas species more volatile than xenon, e.g. for the removal of argon. Therefore, the
more general terminology solute concentration is used in the following.

The PUR system continuously removes electronegative impurities from the LXe and GXe
volumes during a background or a calibration run. The solute transport in the global system
is derived based on this main operation. In the ideal case, the cryostat in ﬁgure 1 can be
simpliﬁed as a static LXe volume with mass ML and solute concentration xL with a GXe
volume above with mass MG and solute concentration xG. It is assumed that the solute in
each volume is homogeneously distributed at all times. At equilibrium, the more volatile
solute is enriched in the GXe. This enrichment can be described by the relative volatility α,
derived from Raoult’s law [19], which is deﬁned as the ratio between the vapor pressure of

From equation (1) the concentration xG in the GXe volume can be related to the concen-
tration xL in the LXe volume at equilibrium. For low solute concentrations (O(ppb) and
below) the following relation holds true

xG =

αxL
1 + (α − 1) xL

≈ αxL,

(2)

where it is assumed that xL(α − 1) (cid:28) 1.

Away from equilibrium, solute particles can migrate from the liquid into the gas until
equation (2) is satisﬁed. This eﬀect is introduced to the model via a migration term with
a migration ﬂow Fmig in units of a xenon mass ﬂow; and is added in equations (6) and (7)
describing the full model. More details on the migration term are given in Ref. [20].

In reality, the system is not static as xenon evaporates with a mass ﬂow Fvap in the cryostat
due to the external heat input. This xenon needs to be re-condensed with a mass ﬂow Fcon
with the help of one of the PTRs as shown in ﬁgure 1. It is possible that these two ﬂows
of xenon transport the solute between the two phases in the LXe TPC, but our data is
not sensitive to the magnitude of this eﬀect due to its degeneracy with Fmig and other free
parameters of the model. In this model, evaporating xenon carries a solute concentration
(αxL), and condensing xenon at the PTR coldﬁnger carries a solute concentration (cid:0) xG
(cid:1). It
implies that the cryostat in combination with the CRY system acts as a distillation-column-
like system with up to two distillation stages. This is further discussed below in subsection
Conﬁguration 3: No circulation. Xenon from the GXe volume with a solute concentration
xG is extracted from the CRY system and guided to the PUR system with a mass ﬂow FG.
From the LXe volume, xenon with a solute concentration xL is extracted and evaporated at
a mass ﬂow FL through the HE. It is assumed that the solute concentration in the extracted
xenon remains constant, as this is a pressure-driven ﬂow, and that the solute concentration
in general is independent from pressure changes in the ﬂow path. Both xenon streams from
the GXe and LXe volumes mix at the PUR system’s inlet. The concentration x1 in the
summed mass ﬂow F1 = FG + FL can be written as

At the PUR outlet, the solute particle ﬂow (x2F2) splits again. A solute particle ﬂow
(x3F3) returns into the GXe volume, while a small fraction of this ﬂow is guided directly
into the bell to stabilize the LXe TPC liquid level. In this model, the gaseous bell volume is
not separated from the rest of the GXe volume, as both are assumed to be in good contact
allowing for fast mixing. Thus, the bell is omitted in ﬁgure 1. The remaining solute ﬂow
(x2(F2 − F3)) ﬂows into the HE for liquefaction. Due to its limited eﬃciency of (cid:15)HE < 1,
the in-going ﬂow is divided into a solute particle ﬂow (x4F4) guided into the GXe and a
solute particle ﬂow (x5F5) added to the LXe volume. The solute concentration x4 should be
larger than x5, scaling with an enrichment factor αHE of the size of the relative volatility
α or even larger: x4 = αHEx5. The respective xenon mass ﬂows can be calculated to be
F5 = (cid:15)HE(F2 − F3) and F4 = (1 − (cid:15)HE) (F2 − F3). Hence, the two solute particle ﬂows to the

8/23

GXe and LXe volumes can be written down as

x4F4 =

x5F5 =

(1 − (cid:15)HE) (F2 − F3),

(cid:15)HE(F2 − F3).

The solute potentially enters the closed system either due to microscopic leaks in the global
system or out-gassing from materials. Since the two phenomena cannot be distinguished,
a single source parameter is introduced to the model as a constant solute particle ﬂow kS
entering the GXe volume as indicated in ﬁgure 1.

Combining all eﬀects, the solute concentration change over time dxG/dt in the GXe and

dxL/dt in the LXe volumes can be described by the following set of diﬀerential equations:

In both equations, the term (I) corresponds to the migration (gas-phase enhancement at
equilibrium), the term (II) to the condensation and the term (III) to the evaporation. For
the GXe volume, the additional terms are the gas extraction (IV), the directly returning
gas (V), the additional returning gas from the HE (VI) and the constant source term (VII).
For the LXe volume, further terms are the extraction (IV), and the liquid returning from
the HE (V). Each solute particle ﬂow is divided by the respective mass of the volume to
model a change in the solute concentration rather than in the number of solute particles.
Furthermore, the sign of each term indicates whether the solute is leaving (−) or entering
(+) a volume.

One additional remark is that the LXe TPC measures the decay of 85Kr particles, while
the other methods, presented in section 4, determine the natKr content within the samples.
With 10.76 yr, the half-life of 85Kr is much longer than the time period investigated here.
Thus, a krypton removal term due to its decay can be neglected for the diﬀerential equations.
During the time period that this paper concerns, the GXe circulation loop of XENON1T,
comprising the PUR and DST subsystems, was operated in seven distinct conﬁgurations.
The set of diﬀerential equations describing the solute transport must be tailored for a given
conﬁguration. For each conﬁguration, table 1 shows the terms in equations (6) and (7)
that are included, and ﬁgure 1 shows the corresponding ﬂow path. In the following, each
conﬁguration is brieﬂy explained.

Conﬁguration 1: Standard puriﬁcation without distillation
Some simpliﬁcations can be made for this conﬁguration: The two branches of the PUR system
are equipped with heated getters. While electronegative impurities are eﬃciently removed,
noble gases pass through these getters unaﬀected. Therefore, the inlet and outlet of the PUR
system feature the same ﬂow and solute concentration: F2 = F1 and x2 = x1, implying that
x3 = x1. Additionally, the directly returning ﬂow to the GXe volume is F3 = FG by design of
the system. This leads to (F2 − F3) = FL for the ﬂow to the HE. Due to its limited eﬃciency,
more gas goes back to the GXe volume than being extracted. In order to keep the masses in
the LXe and GXe volume constant, the condensation ﬂow Fcon needs to be larger than the
evaporated ﬂow Fvap in this conﬁguration, giving

Fcon = Fvap + (1 − (cid:15)HE) FL.

(8)

Conﬁguration 2: Evaporated-liquid-only puriﬁcation without distillation
In this conﬁguration, xenon is extracted and subsequently evaporated only from the LXe
volume with a concentration xL at a ﬂow FL, and thus FG = 0. This allows the extraction
of xenon samples at the PUR system with the concentration xL and gives direct insight to
the krypton inside the LXe volume.

In the PUR system the mass ﬂows are given by F2 = F1 = FL. At the PUR outlet, the ﬂow
back to the GXe volume is F3, where in this case it is equal to the ﬂow going directly into
the bell, and therefore lower than in other conﬁgurations. For the diﬀerent concentrations
x3 = x2 = x1 = xL holds true. The remaining ﬂow of (FL − F3) enters the HE. As a ﬂow FL

10/23

is extracted through the HE from the LXe volume, the HE can liquefy a returning xenon
ﬂow equal to (cid:15)HEFL. It implies that

(FL − F3) (cid:46) (cid:15)HEFL.

(9)

Therefore, the assumption is made that the complete ﬂow can be liqueﬁed and returns into
the LXe volume,

x4F4 = 0,

x5F5 = xL (FL − F3) .

Based on that, the condensation ﬂow in the CRY system needs to be

Fcon = Fvap + F3.

(10)

(11)

(12)

The coupled diﬀerential equation system for this mode can be achieved by inserting above
information into equations (6) and (7). For the GXe volume, the terms for gas extraction
(IV) as well as for the additional gas return from HE (VI) are not present.

Conﬁguration 3: No circulation
In this conﬁguration, e.g. during maintenance work on the PUR system, no xenon leaves or
enters the detector system (FG = FL = 0). Thus, equations (6) and (7) are reduced to the
migration (I), condensation (II) and evaporation (III) terms. The solute distribution between
the GXe and LXe volume for the equilibrium case ( dxG
dt = 0) can be investigated.
By neglecting the source (VII) term, and with equal evaporation and condensation ﬂows
(Fvap = Fcon) based on equation (6) it follows that

dt = dxL

(Fmig + Fcon)
(cid:0)Fmig + Fcon
The only unknown parameter is the migration ﬂow Fmig. Therefore, the two extreme cases
for a fast and a slow migration can be considered, that is

xG = α

(cid:1) xL.

xG = αxL
xG = α2xL

(15)

Due to the active cooling, the solute concentration in the GXe volume is enhanced by a
factor between α (single-stage distillation) and α2 (two-stage distillation).

Conﬁguration 4: Standard puriﬁcation with distillation
The proof of concept for the online distillation method was veriﬁed during the commissioning
of XENON1T. The campaign lasted from 11 Aug to 22 Aug 2016, in parallel with the LXe
TPC commissioning and without interference with other subsystems. Several xenon samples
with the concentration x1 were taken from the PUR system to monitor the krypton-in-xenon
evolution.

The detector was operated in the standard puriﬁcation mode to further decrease elec-
tronegative impurities, with the diﬀerence that a xenon mixture with solute ﬂow (x1FD)
was extracted from the PUR system and guided to the DST system. Here, the xenon was
puriﬁed from the solute with an oﬀgas loss (FD − F (cid:48)
D). The solute particle ﬂow returning to
the PUR system is given by (xDF (cid:48)

D).

An assumption is made to further simplify the equation above: The oﬀgas ﬂow (FD − F (cid:48)

The coupled diﬀerential equation system for C4 (Standard puriﬁcation with distillation)
includes the same terms as C1 (Standard puriﬁcation without distillation). The diﬀerence is
that the PUR outlet mass ﬂow F2 now contains a reduced solute concentration x2. Thus,
all ﬂows returning to the GXe and LXe volumes are also characterized by a lower solute
concentration.

Conﬁguration 5: Puriﬁcation and distillation of gas volume alone
In this conﬁguration, xenon was solely extracted from the GXe volume to test the solute
removal for a decreased exchange time with respect to C4 (Standard puriﬁcation with distil-
lation) of this volume. A ﬁrst attempt of this mode on 22 Aug 2016 was stopped after a few
hours due to a broken circulation pump. After the pump replacement, the main campaign
was performed from 24 Aug to 02 Sep 2016.

Since gas was only extracted from the GXe volume with particle ﬂow (xGFG), the ﬂow
from the LXe volume was FL = 0. Thus, F1 = FG and x1 = xG. Therefore, the samples taken
from the PUR system give direct access to xG. For the distillation, the same ﬂow path as in
C4 (Standard puriﬁcation with distillation) was used. The concentration in the PUR outlet
is given by

For a negligible oﬀgas ﬂow (FD − F (cid:48)

The HE is not operational in this mode as no liquid goes through it. Consequently, the
returning ﬂow from the PUR system goes fully back into the GXe volume with F3 = FG,
from which it follows that Fcon = Fvap.

Inserting the information above into equations (6) and (7), one ﬁnds that the solute con-
centration change in the LXe volume depends only on the migration (I), condensation (II)
and evaporation (III) terms, and no longer on the terms for extraction (IV) and return from
HE (V). Furthermore, both equations are independent from the HE eﬃciency. This is diﬀer-
ent from the other conﬁgurations and makes this conﬁguration more sensitive to Fmig, Fcon
and Fvap.

Conﬁguration 6: Standard puriﬁcation with upgraded gas-volume-only
distillation
The ultimate conﬁguration required hardware modiﬁcations to combine C4 (Standard puriﬁ-
cation with distillation) and C5 (Puriﬁcation and distillation of gas volume alone) with the

12/23

advantage of purifying both volumes from electronegative impurities, while only distilling the
GXe volume as rapidly as possible. For that, a direct connection between the GXe volume
and the inlet of the DST system was installed as represented in ﬁgure 1.

Two short online distillation campaigns, from 28 Sep to 29 Sep 2016 and 13 Oct to 14
Oct 2016, were performed to verify the functionality of the ﬁnal conﬁguration. Finally, a
long-term online distillation campaign was performed from 28 Oct to 12 Dec 2016. During
this operation, the total detector inventory was lowered by about 6 kg per week due to the
oﬀgas ﬂow. As a consequence, the liquid level inside the LXe TPC decreased by 0.1 mm
per week. However, the level was manually adjusted once per week to keep the impact on
the LXe TPC performance negligible. Other inﬂuences on the detector operation were not
observed.

In this conﬁguration, the ﬂow FD = FG from the GXe volume is guided directly into
the DST system and it contains the solute concentration xG. Note that no ﬂow from the
GXe volume is going directly to the PUR inlet. In parallel, only xenon from the LXe volume
ﬂows to the inlet of the PUR system with a solute content of x1 = xL at a ﬂow F1 = FL. The
puriﬁed xenon returns from the DST to the PUR system as shown in ﬁgure 1 with a solute
concentration xD and a ﬂow F (cid:48)
D. Under the assumption of a negligible oﬀgas ﬂow (FD − F (cid:48)
D)
it follows that F (cid:48)
D = FD = FG. Thus, the total ﬂow at the PUR outlet is F2 = FG + FL and
the concentration at this location can be calculated to be

x2 =

FL
F2

xL +

xD.

(20)

After the PUR system outlet, the ﬂow follows the path described in C1 (Standard puriﬁcation
without distillation).

Conﬁguration 7: Standard puriﬁcation with upgraded gas-volume-only
radon distillation
In addition to the online krypton distillation, two online radon distillation campaigns, from
19 Dec 2016 to 26 Jan 2017 and from 31 Jan to 02 Feb 2017, were performed to reduce
the radon-induced background. For this operation, the same ﬂow paths as for C6 (Stan-
dard puriﬁcation with upgraded gas-volume-only distillation) were used with the following
diﬀerence: Radon as the less volatile noble gas accumulates at the bottom of the distillation
column until it decays. The radon-depleted xenon exits the top of the column and returns to
the PUR system as visualized in ﬁgure 1. The more volatile solutes enriched at the top are
therefore not inﬂuenced and can pass through the DST system unaﬀected. Thus, the DST
system’s outlet ﬂow contains the same solute concentration xG as the inlet. It follows that

x2 =

More details on the online radon distillation are given in Ref. [20].

4. Krypton removal

The krypton concentration in the LXe and GXe volumes was monitored from August 2016
to February 2018 in order to observe the eﬃciency of the online distillation method for the
diﬀerent conﬁgurations as well as its evolution during the science runs. This was achieved
using three diﬀerent measurement methods: An on-site residual gas analyzer (RGA) system

13/23

behind a LN2-cooled coldtrap [21, 22], an oﬀ-site rare gas mass spectrometer (RGMS) [23],
and the electronic recoil (ER) event rate (ER rate) inside the LXe TPC itself.

The RGA system was utilized during C4 (Standard puriﬁcation with distillation) and C5
(Puriﬁcation and distillation of gas volume alone), for a quick and direct feedback of the
krypton decrease. The samples taken during C4 (Standard puriﬁcation with distillation)
contained the concentration x1 and were a mixture of xenon extracted and evaporated from
the LXe volume and xenon extracted from the GXe volume (referred to as ˆx1,RGA).

The samples during C5 (Puriﬁcation and distillation of gas volume alone) were extracted
solely from the GXe volume (referred to as ˆxG,RGA). During C6 (Standard puriﬁcation
with upgraded gas-volume-only distillation), the krypton concentrations were below the RGA
sensitivity and thus, no samples were measured with the RGA in this conﬁguration.

The RGMS is capable of detecting trace amounts of natural krypton-in-xenon down to the
ppq level [23]. It allowed for the determination of the krypton concentration xL within the
LXe volume throughout the full time period investigated, including commissioning, science
runs SR0 [24] and SR1 [18]. For the extraction of the samples (referred to as ˆxL,RGMS), the
detector operation was switched to C2 (Evaporated-liquid-only puriﬁcation without distilla-
tion), where xenon was extracted and evaporated solely from the LXe volume. Additionally,
on 25 May 2017, one sample with concentration x1 was extracted during C1 (Standard
puriﬁcation without distillation) (referred to as ˆx1,RGMS).

The ER event rate (referred to as ˆxL,ER) data from the LXe TPC gave the most precise
insight into the krypton evolution in the LXe volume as the krypton beta decay rate is
proportional to the number of krypton atoms. Before the online distillation, the krypton
concentration was on the order of ppb such that the overall detector event rate at energies
up to 200 keV was dominated by krypton beta events. Several selection criteria were applied
to obtain the rate in a core volume of about 725 kg. Days with low statistics or unstable
detector conditions were also neglected. Further details are presented in Ref. [20].

In ﬁgure 3, the resulting ER rate between August 2016 and February 2017 is visualized
in blue along with the absolute krypton-in-xenon concentrations obtained from the RGMS
data in red. The diﬀerent online krypton distillation campaigns are shaded in light grey
indicating the time periods when krypton was being removed from the system. The online
radon distillation campaign, shaded in dark grey, reduced the ER rate by another 20 %, but
it had no impact on the krypton concentration. The details for this operation are discussed
in Ref. [20]. The ﬁrst RGMS data point was taken in the krypton-dominated period and was
matched to the event rate. This scaling was used to convert all event rate data to equivalent
krypton concentrations for the purpose of ﬁtting the model. For comparison, the ER rates of
other liquid xenon-based dark matter experiments such as XENON100 [25], LUX [26] and
PandaX-II [27] are shown. Among them, XENON1T reached the lowest background to date
with the help of the online distillation method.

C4 (Standard puriﬁcation with distillation) and C5 (Puriﬁcation and distillation of gas vol-
ume alone) conﬁgurations eﬃciently reduced the krypton concentration inside the LXe TPC
as indicated by both the event rate as well as the RGMS data. After the two short tests with
C6 (Standard puriﬁcation with upgraded gas-volume-only distillation) where no large reduc-
tion can be observed, the RGMS samples still matched the event rate. During the long-term
online distillation campaign with C6 (Standard puriﬁcation with upgraded gas-volume-only

14/23

distillation), the event rate starts to level oﬀ around December 2016, while the RGMS data
points reveal a further absolute krypton concentration decrease. This is a clear indication
that krypton is no longer the dominant ER background source. Therefore, the event rate
cannot be further applied as a krypton monitoring tool starting from February 2017. The
lowest krypton concentration ever documented in a xenon-based detector is (360 ± 60) ppq,
measured in XENON1T with the xenon sample from 16 Feb 2017. This value was suﬃciently
low for XENON1T, as krypton was reduced to a subdominant ER source.

Fig. 3: ER event rate during online distillation campaigns in XENON1T: The ER event rate
ˆxL,ER (blue) between August 2016 and February 2017 was reduced by online krypton distil-
lation campaigns (light grey shaded area) using C4 (Standard puriﬁcation with distillation),
C5 (Puriﬁcation and distillation of gas volume alone), and C6 (Standard puriﬁcation with
upgraded gas-volume-only distillation). The ER event rate was further reduced by an online
radon distillation campaign (dark grey shaded area) by applying C7 (Standard puriﬁcation
with upgraded gas-volume-only radon distillation). Absolute krypton-in-xenon measurements
ˆxL,RGMS with the RGMS are illustrated in red. Note that the online radon distillation had
no impact on the krypton concentration. Figure based on [20].

In the following, the model derived in section 3 is ﬁtted to the absolute krypton concen-
trations from the diﬀerent methods mentioned above. For the diﬀerent conﬁgurations, the
values of FG(t), FL(t), FD(t), (cid:15)HE = 0.975, and Fcon(t) are derived from slow control param-
eters and thus are deﬁned at all times. These variables are used as input for the model and
a summary of typical values is given in table 2.

After the re-condensation by the PTR, an unkown amount of xenon evaporates while
travelling through the cryopipe before reaching the LXe volume in the cryostat. Thus, the
obtained values for Fcon(t) represent only an upper limit of the condensed ﬂow; and a free
ﬁt parameter 0 < (cid:15)con ≤ 1 was deﬁned to ﬁt the data with a scaled-down condensed ﬂow

((cid:15)conFcon(t)). This also aﬀects the size of the evaporation ﬂow Fvap(t) that is calculated from
Fcon(t). The relative volatility is ﬁxed to α = 10.5 (at −98 °C [28]) in all parts of the model,
except for the HE. The enrichment in the HE is unknown, and therefore the variable αHE
is a free ﬁt parameter. The masses in both volumes are initially ﬁxed to MG = 21.5 kg and
ML = 3190 kg, respectively. In the case of the LXe volume, ML subsequently decreases during
online krypton distillation campaigns due to the oﬀgas ﬂow (FD − F (cid:48)
D) that is derived from
slow control. Given the large separation factor with veriﬁed outlet concentrations below
48 ppq [10], it is assumed that no krypton leaves the distillation system’s puriﬁed outlet
(xD = 0). One unknown parameter is the migration ﬂow Fmig accounting for the migration
eﬀect in a static LXe volume with GXe phase above, away from equilibrium. That is ﬁtted
as well. Another free ﬁt parameter is the krypton source term kS to account for the krypton
increase in the system after the last online distillation campaign. Furthermore, a constant
background cbg is introduced as a free parameter to take the ﬂattening of the ER rate
during the long-term operation in C6 (Standard puriﬁcation with upgraded gas-volume-only
distillation) into account. With that, the ER data points are ﬁtted to

xL,ER(t) = xL(t) + cbg.

(22)

All ﬁt parameters are assumed to be time independent.

At t = 0, the detector is assumed to be in krypton particle equilibrium during C1 (Standard
puriﬁcation without distillation). Consequently, the change of krypton in the GXe as well as
LXe is (dxG/dt) |t=0 = (dxL/dt) |t=0 = 0. The starting concentration in the liquid xL,0 is a
free ﬁt parameter. By solving equation (6), the corresponding krypton concentration xG,0 in
the GXe can be calculated [20].

In order to infer the set of parameters which describes the data best, we construct for
each quantity we measure (ˆxG,RGA, ˆxL,RGMS, ˆxL,ER, ˆx1,RGA, ˆx1,RGMS) a likelihood term
which we combine into a ﬁnal likelihood used for inference. This means that the ﬁtting
routine minimizes the model prediction with respect to the data points. For example, xG
is compared with ˆxG,RGA, xL with ˆxL,RGMS, xL,ER with ˆxL,ER, and x1 with ˆx1,RGA as well
as ˆx1,RGMS. The optimization is implemented as a χ2-minimization with iMinuit [29, 30] to
obtain the set of best-ﬁt parameters shown in table 3. The corresponding model and data
points are depicted in ﬁgure 4. For better overview, the results are divided into diﬀerent
time intervals including the relevant data and ﬁt curves for each interval. The normalized
residuals are shown below each plot.

The initial krypton concentration xL,0 in the LXe volume allows to calculate the related
concentration within the GXe volume to be xG,0 = 1.3 × 105 ppt. The ratio between both
phases yields an enhancement in the GXe volume by a factor of 64, about 6 times larger
than the relative volatility α = 10.5. As shown in equations (14) and (15), an enhancement
factor between α (single-stage distillation) and α2 (two-stage distillation) is expected in the
GXe volume.

The ﬁtted factor (cid:15)con to scale Fcon, and by that also Fvap, is correlated with Fmig. Both,
(cid:15)con and Fmig, contribute to terms in equations (6) and (7) that allow the krypton to move
into the GXe volume. Our data does not allow to diﬀerentiate the two processes as explained
in section 3. However, from the best ﬁt result, the migration ﬂow of Fmig is the lowest with
respect to the other ﬂows used in the model. As discussed in more details in Ref. [20], the
evaporation ﬂow Fvap and the extraction ﬂow FL seem to be the main drivers of the krypton
removal from the LXe volume. The background cbg in units of a krypton concentration can
be interpreted as the radon contribution to the ER rate in XENON1T and can be converted
to a 222Rn activity concentration of (13.5 ± 2.6) µBq/kg [20]. This is in agreement with
the value of (13.6 ± 0.9) µBq/kg in XENON1T during December 2016 from independent
in-situ α−spectroscopy [31]. The source term kS can be attributed either to external leaks
or to desorption from internal detector materials. The obtained value would correspond to
an air leak rate of kair = (2.9 ± 0.2) × 10−5 (mbar × l)/s, assuming a krypton air fraction
of 1.14 × 10−6 vol/vol [32]. As the global XENON1T system was leak-checked to be below
10−8 (mbar × l)/s, the rate seems to be too high to originate from external leaks. The amount
of residual air trapped in PTFE detector components is inferred in Ref. [33] from the rate of
oxygen desorbing from their surfaces. The desorption rate is derived from a time-series ﬁt to
the electron lifetime, which is inversely proportional to the concentration of oxygen in the
LXe volume. The result is compatible with the source term kS found in this work, assuming
a krypton air fraction as stated above, implying that desorption of krypton from PTFE is
a measurable background source. This ﬁnding shows that the pumping time prior to xenon
ﬁlling crucially impacts the krypton-in-xenon concentration after the krypton removal. It
further shows that relying on the conventional oﬄine krypton removal technqiues is risky.
This risk can be fully avoided by applying the online distillation.

The enrichment factor αHE in the HE is constrained to be much larger than the relative
volatility α, meaning that basically all krypton entering the HE returns to the GXe volume
of the cryostat. This is mainly due to the C4 (Standard puriﬁcation with distillation) data,

operational during C5 (Puriﬁcation and distillation of gas volume alone). The large αHE
could be due to un-modeled systematics in these measurements, or a true enhancement in
the GXe solute concentration in the HE. Since the xenon ﬂow in the HE is unidirectional,
in contrast to the other volumes, the high krypton vapor pressure may make it diﬃcult for
krypton particles to enter the LXe from the GXe, leading to an enhancement as the xenon
repeatedly condenses and liquiﬁes along its path back to the cryostat, especially across the
large surface in the tube-in-tube heat exchanger section.

Figure 4 (Top) shows the time period from t = 0 d (05 Aug 2016) until t = 30 d including
C4 (Standard puriﬁcation with distillation) (dark grey) as well as C5 (Puriﬁcation and
distillation of gas volume alone) (light grey).

Figure 4 (Middle) contains the time period t = 30 d until t = 140 d. The two thin shaded
areas correspond to the short test operations using C6 (Standard puriﬁcation with upgraded
gas-volume-only distillation), while the wide shaded area represents the long term distillation
in this conﬁguration. According to the model, the minimum krypton concentration reached
inside the LXe TPC was xL,min = 80 ppq at t = 137 d. The corresponding concentration in
the GXe volume was calculated to be xG(t = 137 d) = 5.3 ppt, a factor of 66 larger than in
the LXe volume, as also observed during C1 (Standard puriﬁcation without distillation) at
the beginning of the time period investigated. Due to the source term kS, this unprecedented
low concentration could not be maintained. The eﬀective time constants τeﬀ for the exponen-
tial decrease of xL are computed for the diﬀerent online distillation conﬁgurations and are
compared in table 4 along with the reduction achieved in the LXe volume for the given dura-
tion. One ﬁnds that C6 (Standard puriﬁcation with upgraded gas-volume-only distillation) is
the most eﬃcient conﬁguration, as expected.

Figure 4 (Bottom) illustrates the time period from t = 140 d until t = 550 d (06 Feb 2018).
Compared to the minimum concentration, krypton increased by a factor of 13.5 to xL(t =
550 d) = 1 ppt.

Some time periods show a systematic mismatch between the model and data, indicating
un-modeled eﬀects and leading to a large (χ2/NDF) value. Given the complexity of the
system and the variation of detector conditions over the time span of 550 d, the model
described the data adequately overall.

5. Argon removal
A gaseous 37Ar source was deployed in XENON1T in October 2018 before its decommission-
ing [15] that allowed for a calibration down to energies of 2.8 keV and 0.27 keV via electron
capture [16].

At its critical temperature of −123 °C, argon features a vapor pressure of about 50 bar
[28]. At the LXe temperature of −96 °C, the argon vapor pressure is not deﬁned. Therefore,
the relative volatility is assumed to be αAr > 25 for a xenon pressure of 2 bar. The larger
volatility with respect to krypton should make the online distillation more eﬃcient, i.e.
reducing 37Ar with a faster eﬀective time constant than krypton.

The 37Ar event rate evolution in the LXe volume is ﬁtted with the online distillation
model of this work including the time periods of the injection, the calibration as well as
the removal. Conﬁgurations C1 (Standard puriﬁcation without distillation), C2 (Evaporated-
liquid-only puriﬁcation without distillation), and C6 (Standard puriﬁcation with upgraded
gas-volume-only distillation) were used during the 37Ar calibration campaign. In order to
apply the model to the argon data, small modiﬁcations need to be done to the coupled
diﬀerential equations (6) and (7) for the diﬀerent conﬁgurations.

First, the relative volatility was changed to a ﬁt parameter with αAr > 25 since argon is
supercritical at LXe temperature, and the source term kS was set to zero. Second, in contrast
to 85Kr, the reduction of the event rate due to the radioactive decay of 37Ar needs to be taken
into account. Therefore, the terms (−λAr37xG) and (−λAr37xL) with λAr37 = 0.019 80 d−1 are
added to the equations for GXe and LXe, respectively. The parameter (cid:15)con was ﬁxed to 0.31
as taken from the krypton removal ﬁt to reduce the number of free parameters, since it is
anyway strongly correlated with the migration ﬂow Fmig and the relative volatility αAr.

The gaseous source was added to the PUR system during C1 (Standard puriﬁcation without
distillation). In total, three 37Ar injections were done during the calibration campaign. For
simplicity, each injection in this model is added directly into the GXe volume as a delta
peak +kinject for its given injection time.

The results of the ﬁt are summarized in table 5 where the injections into the GXe volume
were directly transformed into an activity Ainject for better readability. The evolution of the
37Ar event rate in the LXe volume and the corresponding ﬁt curve xL are plotted in ﬁgure 5.
The corresponding evolution for the GXe volume xG was omitted for better visualization.
The ratio xG/xL shows an 37Ar enrichment in the GXe volume by a factor 100 during
C1 (Standard puriﬁcation without distillation), larger than the ﬁtted value for αAr. This
behaviour was also observed in the krypton case, and is expected from the discussions in
section 3. The migration ﬂow Fmig and the relative volatility αAr are part of the migration
term in the diﬀerential equations and thus, are correlated. Therefore, a comparison of the
migration ﬂow to the case of krypton is not possible. Furthermore, the model can eﬀectively

describe the argon evolution, but cannot be used to measure precisely the relative volatility
for argon in xenon since the global system is too complex and not designed for such a
measurement.

The eﬀective time constant for the 37Ar decrease during the online distillation campaign
is τeﬀ,Ar = 1.7 d and shows an eﬃcient reduction within two weeks. This makes it possible
to consider 37Ar as a regular calibration source for multi-tonne xenon detectors such as
XENONnT, LZ, PandaX-4T, and DARWIN.

In the case of XENONnT, the main xenon handling infrastructure relevant for the online
distillation method stays the same with the addition of a LXe puriﬁcation system. The GXe
volume mass remains about 20 kg, while the LXe volume mass is three times larger than in
XENON1T. The external heat input is expected to be also about three times larger, and
scales with the larger surface of the XENONnT cryostat. Thus, the time constant of the
evaporation term, one of the main drivers of the solute transport, is expected to be similar
in XENONnT. The extraction ﬂow FL, the other main driver, remains the same, and thus,
its time constant is larger resulting in a slower overall removal in XENONnT. However, the
new LXe puriﬁcation system extracts large ﬂows of xenon of about 2 LPM directly in liquid
form from the cryostat. Unless the returning LXe is sub-cooled through other means, the net
eﬀect would be an additional heat input to the cryostat. This could result in an enhanced
transport of lighter components from the LXe to the GXe volume by xenon evaporation
yielding a boost in the removal time constant. The size of this eﬀect cannot be estimated,
but will be further investigated in XENONnT.

Conclusion

A novel online distillation technique was developed for the XENON1T experiment to reduce
more volatile intrinsic noble gases inside the LXe TPC during its normal operation. The
method is based on a continuous distillation of the gaseous xenon volume of the detector
with the help of the XENON1T cryogenic distillation column. The main focus was to lower
the krypton-in-xenon concentration for the ﬁrst XENON1T science run. A conﬁrmed con-
centration of (360 ± 60) ppq in the liquid xenon detection volume was achieved, the lowest
measured in a dark matter detector to date. The online distillation was stopped as soon as
krypton was a negligible background with respect to radon, but before reaching its limits.
In addition, the online distillation method was applied to reduce 37Ar after it was deployed
as a calibration source for low energies down to 2.8 keV. Usually, the 37Ar half-life of 35.01 d
is too long for regular use of this source. However, the online distillation reduced the 37Ar
event rate inside the LXe TPC back to a negligible level within two weeks.

An online distillation model was developed to describe several detector conﬁgurations
based on coupled diﬀerential equations for the krypton-in-xenon concentrations within the
detector’s LXe and GXe volumes. The krypton time evolution in the system was monitored
via the event rate within the LXe TPC itself, as well as via several extracted xenon sam-
ples. The model was successfully ﬁtted to the data over a time span of 550 days, including
the commissioning, science run 0 and science run 1 of XENON1T. The gained knowledge
regarding the krypton transport inside the diﬀerent xenon handling subsystems helps for the
development of future experiments.

With small adaptions due to the properties of argon, such as a higher volatility compared to
krypton, the online distillation model was validated by successfully ﬁtting the 37Ar induced
event rate evolution in the LXe volume.

Whenever an online distillation is performed, a small oﬀgas ﬂow needs to be removed
from the distillation system, and thus from the global system. This xenon loss needs to be
balanced by over-ﬁlling (re-ﬁlling) the detector directly via the distillation column before
(after) the operation. In future applications, this process can be optimized and automated to
keep the xenon mass in the global system constant by supplying additional xenon from the
storage system to the DST system’s inlet. Other inﬂuences on the LXe TPC performance
were not observed.

In summary, the online distillation method can be applied at any given time during the
lifetime of an experiment, either to reduce impurities after initial detector ﬁlling or after
accidental leaks due to handling errors or hardware failures, or to remove more volatile
noble gas calibration sources. Since the concept was proven for argon and krypton, also
helium and neon should be eﬃciently removed.
