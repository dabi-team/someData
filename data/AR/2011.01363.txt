Electron beam ion traps (EBIT) are ideal tools for both production and study of highly charged ions (HCI).
In order to reduce their construction, maintenance, and operation costs we have developed a novel, compact,
room-temperature design, the Heidelberg Compact EBIT (HC-EBIT). Four already commissioned devices
operate at the strongest ﬁelds (up to 0.86 T) reported for such EBITs using permanent magnets, run electron
beam currents up to 80 mA and energies up to 10 keV. They demonstrate HCI production, trapping, and
extraction of pulsed Ar16+ bunches and continuous 100 pA ion beams of highly charged Xe up to charge
state 29+, already with a 4 mA, 2 keV electron beam. Moreover, HC-EBITs oﬀer large solid-angle ports and
thus high photon count rates, e. g., in x-ray spectroscopy of dielectronic recombination in HCIs up to Fe24+,
achieving an electron-energy resolving power of E/∆E > 1500 at 5 keV. Besides traditional on-axis electron
guns, we have also implemented a novel oﬀ-axis gun for laser, synchrotron, and free-electron laser applications,
oﬀering clear optical access along the trap axis. We report on its ﬁrst operation at a synchrotron radiation
facility demonstrating resonant photoexcitation of highly charged oxygen.

INTRODUCTION

Highly charged ions (HCI) constitute a large class of
atomic systems, since each element has as many ioniza-
tion states as it has protons – in a sense this extends
the periodic table by a further dimension. As a conse-
quence of virialization in deep gravitational potentials1,
HCIs are the predominant form in which most of the el-
ements appear in the visible universe, be it in or around
stars2, galaxies and their clusters3, or in the vast ex-
panses of the intergalactic medium4–6. Consequently,
for many decades the study of HCIs has been essential
for astrophysics and astronomy7–9, and many examples
of recent laboratory work continuously show its impor-
tance not only for astrophysics (see, e. g.,10–13 and ref-
erences therein), but also for plasma and fusion research
(e. g., in14–24). In atomic physics, HCI studies often deal
with fundamental interactions due to relativistic eﬀects,
quantum electrodynamics (QED) and nuclear-size con-
tributions which are all enhanced by several orders of
magnitude25–28 compared to neutral or singly charged

systems. This, for instance, facilitated the precise de-
termination of the electron mass29,30 and the electron
magnetic moment31 as well as stringent QED tests32–36.
Moreover, several proposals contemplate HCIs as ideal
laboratory probes of a possible variation of the ﬁne-
structure constant α37–50 and as frequency references
for optical clocks51–57 superior to state-of-the-art opti-
cal lattice or singly-charged ion clocks. The very low
polarizability of their electronic wave function explains
their insensitivity to both spurious external perturba-
tions and laser-induced light shifts. Suitable forbidden
optical transitions have been theoretically identiﬁed, and
preliminary laboratory determinations of their energies
carried out58. Other current applications are tumor ion
therapy59 and EUV nanolithography60–63. Nevertheless,
the HCI research community has remained rather small
as HCI production is perceived as demanding and, in-
deed, there are still open challenges before it becomes a
standard routine.

One of the ﬁrst ever mentions of an ‘ion trap’ in the
literature, by Pierce and others in the 1940’s64–66, de-
scribes a system in which atoms were ionized by electron
impact and their ions radially trapped by the negative
space charge potential of the electron beam and axially
by cylindrical electrodes forming an axial potential well.
They carried out investigations on ionic space charge and
its eﬀect on electron-beam propagation. Donets67–69 and
Arianer70,71 introduced the electron beam ion source,
with the addition of a magnetic ﬁeld for electron-beam

 
 
 
 
 
 
compression. The modern electron beam ion trap (EBIT)
based upon this was developed in the 1980’s at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) by Marrs and
Levine72–74. An EBIT operates by means of a focused
mono-energetic electron beam. Emitted from an electron
gun, this beam is accelerated, guided along the axis of a
set of cylindrical electrodes (referred to as drift tubes),
decelerated, and dumped on a collector electrode. A
strong axial magnetic ﬁeld of increasing ﬂux density com-
presses the beam to a diameter of a fraction of a millime-
ter at the trap center, resulting in an extremely high cur-
rent density (in certain EBITs on the order of 104 A/cm2)
– the key feature for eﬃcient ionization and subsequent
ion trapping. The beam energy results from the potential
diﬀerence between the cathode and the central trap elec-
trode, with corrections due to the space charge of both
electron beam and trapped ions, the work function of the
materials used for the electrodes, and adjacent poten-
tials. Neutral atoms can be injected as an atomic beam
by introducing a gas or a volatile organometallic com-
pound through a diﬀerentially pumped injection system.
Other techniques are also applied, employing a laser ion
source75 or a wire-probe target76. Ionized by electron-
beam impact, the ions are immediately trapped radially
by the negative space charge of the compressed electron
beam itself, as well as by the magnetic ﬁeld. Axially, the
conﬁnement is controlled by the electrostatic potentials
applied to the drift tubes. Charge breeding is realized
by further sequential ionization of the trapped ions by
the electron beam. The highest possible charge state is
limited by its kinetic energy. Finally, the charge-state
distribution is determined by the ionization and recom-
bination rates, depending on the electron beam energy
and density, the conﬁnement time, and the background
pressure77. Details on the operating principle can be
found elsewhere in the literature78–80.

With direct optical access to the conﬁned ion cloud,
mono-energetic excitation, narrow ion-charge distribu-
tions and small source-volume sizes, EBITs have be-
come essential spectroscopic tools in the last three
decades, from the pioneering work on x-rays at LLNL,
down to the optical range, there as well as in other
groups58,81–106. Beyond electron-impact excitation and
ionization of the trapped ions utilizing the electron beam,
photoexcitation and photoionization by mono-energetic
photons at synchrotrons107–111 and free-electron laser
(FEL) facilities12,112,113 have also been reported, in part
using the EBIT magnetic trapping mode114, for which
the electron beam is switched oﬀ. However, these experi-
ments are limited by Doppler broadening due to high ion
temperatures (105 to 107 K). To overcome this limitation,
HCIs can be extracted from an EBIT and loaded into
Paul115 or Penning traps116–121 where advanced cooling
techniques can be applied. Recently, Ar13+ ions have
been re-trapped in a cryogenic radio-frequency trap122
and sympathetically cooled down to below 100 mK by
laser-cooled Be+ Coulomb crystals123,124. This 8-orders-
of-magnitude cooling will ﬁnally allow high-precision

rect frequency-comb spectroscopy from the optical to

extraction and subsequent detection of
ions can be
used to determine the charge-state distribution in the
trap and has been used to investigate resonant pho-
toionization by synchrotron radiation107,108,111. EBITs
also operate as versatile HCI sources in experiments
investigating charge transfer processes127, HCI-surface
interactions128–133, and for rapid charge breeding of ra-
dioactive ions134,135.

Most of the reported experiments have been carried
out using high-performance EBITs, employing supercon-
ducting magnets with ﬂux densities from 3 to 8 T. Room-
temperature EBITs with permanent magnets have also
been developed in order to reduce size as well as costs
and to ease operation. After the pioneering apparatus
built in Paris by Khodja and Briand137, soon several
others followed in Dresden138,139, Tokyo140, Belfast141,
Shanghai142, Clemson143, and at NIST144. Related de-
vices based on permanent magnets were also recently
developed145.

Here, we report on a novel class of devices with a
stronger magnetic ﬁeld than for any other previously
built room-temperature EBIT. The operation with the
newly designed electron gun, drift-tube assembly, and
collector results in excellent performance parameters.

eight arrays of 3 × 3 magnets (dark green, encased in protecting aluminum cartridges), guided and focused by soft-iron and
magnetic-steel elements (light green). In the gap around the trap center the ﬁeld reaches 0.86 T. The electron gun is mounted
on a long titanium rod and positioned with an XYZ- and a linear manipulator. The drift-tube assembly and the collector
are mounted inside the central vacuum chamber. The inset shows a photograph of a bluish ﬂuorescing HCI cloud excited by
electron-beam impact.

Requirements of low cost, low maintenance, reliable and
stable operation, high-numerical-aperture optical access
for spectroscopy, easy transportability, and compact size
have been fulﬁlled. These points are crucial for provid-
ing HCIs to a variety of new experiments and are in part
prerequisites for measurements at synchrotron-radiation
sources and FELs. Following our ﬁrst prototype, already
serving as an HCI source for a Penning trap, we have
commissioned three further devices, PTB-EBIT, PolarX-
EBIT and Tip-EBIT, of the upgraded HC-EBIT design
on which this report will mainly focus.

II. DESIGN

A. Magnetic structure and central vacuum chamber

We chose a magnetic structure with a discrete four-
fold rotational symmetry, allowing for a compact overall
size and suﬃcient space around the trap (see Fig. 1).
Close access for detectors, spectrometers, pumps, and
target injection is oﬀered through four radial DN40CF
ports (see Figs. 2 and 3) machined on four sides of the
central cubical chamber (side length of 70 mm). Four
arrays of NdFeB permanent disk magnets (dark green
in Fig. 2) for each of the two poles generate the mag-
netic ﬁeld. Each disk magnet (N45 quality, diameter of
45 mm, height of 30 mm) is magnetized along its cylin-

structures with vacuum chamber. Blue-anodized aluminum

steel elements were burnished to prevent rusting.

der axis. The arrays consist of three parallel stacks of
three magnets each and are mounted between magnetic-
steel parts connected to four ﬂux-return rods (soft iron)
and two hollow conical pole pieces (soft iron), respec-
tively, constituting the entire yoke (light green in Fig. 2).

FIG. 4. Axial magnetic ﬁeld and electrostatic system of the HC-EBIT design. (a) Simulated and measured magnetic ﬂux
densities on the electron beam axis are shown. The COMSOL simulations apparently underestimate the saturation magnetiza-
tion and permeability of materials or the magnetization of the permanent magnets, resulting in slightly higher experimentally
achieved values. The measurements (with gaussmeter 7010, F.W. Bell) match within uncertainties except for minor deviations
between 30 and 110 mm from the trap center. (b) The electrostatic system including on-axis Pierce-type electron gun, drift-tube
assembly with drift tubes 1 to 6 (DT1 to DT6), water-cooled collector, and ion extraction optics composed of two individual
tubes for focusing is displayed. (c) An illustration of a typical axial electrostatic potential curve is shown. Here, DT1 to DT3
are used to refocus the electron beam while DT3 to DT5 provide the axial ion trapping. The extraction optics electrodes are
biased to a lower voltage than the cathode in order to prevent electrons from passing through.

These pole pieces guide and concentrate a nearly fully ro-
tationally symmetric magnetic ﬁeld into the trap region
while they are close to magnetic saturation. The pieces
are bisected along their symmetry axis and are mounted
surrounding two conical vacuum chamber sections, which
contain the electron gun and the collector. These sections
are welded at their respective narrow ends to the central
cube, which has an inner bore of 16 mm along the trap
axis, and houses the drift-tube assembly. The two coni-
cal sections widen to DN63CF ﬂanges and form together

with the cube a symmetric 405-mm-long chamber. The
pole pieces are ﬁtted into conical bores on either side
of the cube to reduce the magnetic gap (19 mm long,
19 mm bore diameter), while remaining outside of the
vacuum. The sharp-edged geometry at their tips helps
to leak out the ﬁeld eﬃciently. The brittle magnets are
mounted in stacked aluminum cartridges (see Fig. 3) pro-
viding mechanical protection and a water-cooling system
to keep them below their Curie temperature of 80 ◦C dur-
ing bake-out of the vacuum chamber.

320 mm × 350 mm with a height of 350 mm and generates
a magnetic ﬂux density of more than 0.86 T at the trap
center. Finite-element simulations (COMSOL136) were
used to optimize the setup with various simultaneous re-
quirements in mind: maximum ﬂux density at trap center
with zero ﬁeld at the cathode position for electron beam
compression according to Herrmann’s theory146 as well as
suﬃcient ﬂux density between trap center and both elec-
tron gun and collector for beam transport. The magnetic
ﬂux density at the trap center was found to be limited
by the material properties of the soft-iron pole pieces,
resulting in the choice of three layers of magnets on each
array. Adding a fourth layer would only increase the ﬂux
by about 3 % according to our simulations. Fig. 4(a)
compares our simulations and the measured ﬁelds, which
are slightly higher due to underestimated permeability
and saturation strength of both soft iron and magnetic
steel as well as the magnetization of the NdFeB magnets.
At 93.4(2.1) mm axial distance from the trap center, two
locations with zero ﬁeld are chosen for cathode and col-
lector positions. At larger distances the ﬁeld reverses di-
rection and increases again in magnitude before decaying
to zero (see Fig. 4(a)).

A further increase of the magnetic ﬁeld requires in-
vacuum pole pieces for a narrower bore. We follow this
approach with a very similar prototype at SPring-8147
using rectangular magnets and in-vacuum vanadium per-
mendur pole pieces (VIC International) with a bore of
only 8 mm diameter to reach ﬁeld strengths of over 1 T
(see Fig. 5). Measurements with this scalable appara-
tus and FEMM simulations of up to 6 magnet layers are
compared in Fig. 5(a) indicating good agreement.

B. Assembling the magnetic structure

Mounting the strong permanent magnets requires par-
ticular care, since forces acting on them can suddenly
appear. Their non-linear dependence on the magnetic
gap easily makes them uncontrollable, causing injuries
and destruction of the magnets. The magnets should
only be individually unpacked and handled, and mount-
ing of the magnetic structure should make use of tools
that keep body parts far away from a potential squeez-
ing hazard. To reduce such risks, we developed the fol-
lowing procedure: First, the central vacuum chamber is
horizontally mounted on two holders for the DN63CF
ﬂanges which are ﬁrmly ﬁxed to a heavy table (wooden
or aluminum-top). The holders permit, when loosened, a
rotation around the central axis of the vacuum chamber.
Then, the bisected conical pole pieces are inserted into
the grooves of the central cube and the similarly bisected
square-proﬁle yoke elements are mounted around the rim
of the pole pieces with a 90 ◦ rotation between their re-
spective cuts. The square-proﬁle elements are screwed to
the pole pieces and also to two rings welded to the vac-
uum chamber. The resulting stable structure protects

ulations (solid lines, FEMM) and measurements (circles) up
to 2 magnet layers. The good agreement promises achiev-
able magnetic ﬂux densities of more than 1 T. Diﬀering from

lar magnets and in-vacuum pole pieces allowing for a narrower

the weld seam at the cube from a potential bending or
torsion of the conical vacuum chamber extensions when,
e. g., the DN63CF ﬂanges are tightened. Prior to the
mounting of the magnets, their ﬁeld strengths were mea-
sured for their proper arrangement in the magnet arrays
to accomplish the rotational symmetry for the magnetic
ﬁeld of the EBIT. Furthermore, the polarity of each mag-
net was clearly marked on it. The magnets can be indi-
vidually handled, provided that no magnetic parts are
close nearby. For the mounting procedure, we have de-
signed a mounting tool capable of magnetically grabbing
a single magnet on a magnetic-steel piston brazed to the
end of a M10 threaded rod. This piston slides inside a
0.5 m-long hollow brass rod when screwing the threaded
rod in or out. A grabbed magnet rests on the far end of
the tool, since the tool has the same outer diameter of
45 mm as the magnet. By moving the magnetic piston
inwards, it slowly separates from the magnet and releases
it safely. The tool can be held with two hands at a safe
distance from the magnet and facilitates a careful man-
ual insertion of each magnet into the corresponding hole
of the cartridge. When the grabbed magnet approaches

currents induced in the aluminum cartridges and the lim-
ited air-ﬂow through the tight gap between the magnet
and the cartridge reduce the attracting force and prevent
damage when the magnet-magnet gap is closed. After
partial ﬁlling of one array, repulsive forces start to appear
at certain gap separations between the magnet being in-
serted and the layer of magnets below. The mounting
tool helps to push the magnet further in to overcome
this repulsion. Then, the force immediately reverses di-
rection and the magnet is again pulled inwards. After
completing two arrays by ﬁlling all six cartridges on one
side, the outer ﬂux-return rod is installed to complete
that quarter of the magnetic structure. In this last step,
the soft-iron rod, preinstalled to the magnetic-steel caps
on either side, is lowered to the two magnet arrays by
temporarily using long threaded rods to guide this mo-
tion. Further threaded rods are screwed through threads
in the magnetic-steel caps and rest on the two topmost
cartridges when the outer yoke part has slid towards the
arrays. By screwing these rods out, the outer yoke part
approaches the arrays further and the magnetic gap can
be closed in a controlled way. After that, one proceeds
to ﬁll the cartridges on the opposite side to keep mag-
netic forces balanced. By rotating the whole structure as
described above, one can always work in horizontal direc-
tion. In principle, the stacked structure of cartridges also
allows for removing possibly damaged magnets by sliding
the aluminum cartridges sideways and gradually reduc-
ing the magnetic forces between the stacked magnets.
However, no magnets were damaged during the assem-
bly of all three EBITs of the new HC-EBIT design. We
strongly recommend that the procedure described above
is only performed by trained personnel following strict
safety rules in order to avoid serious injuries.

C. Electron gun

1. Choice of the cathode

The strong electron beam of an EBIT, typically hun-
dreds of mA for a superconducting EBIT, can only be re-
liably sustained over long periods of operation by the use
of thermionic dispenser cathodes. Among many available
options, barium-impregnated tungsten dispenser cath-
odes have proven to be the most suitable cathode type for
EBITs. Due to their low work function (≈ 2 eV), they can
operate at rather low temperatures of around 1300 K and
yield current emission densities of up to 10 A/cm2. This
dispenser-type cathode has been the most widely used
choice in telecommunications, radar, aerospace, and re-
lated industries for decades. A depletion of barium on the
emission surface is compensated by a constant replenish-
ment from the tungsten-matrix reservoir of the dispenser
cathode. This principle aﬀords routine lifetimes of about
100,000 hours of operation even at strong emission cur-
rents. The material itself is not brittle, can be machined

viding high-voltage insulation with suﬃciently large creeping

and electron-beam welded. Molybdenum, alumina ce-
ramic, and OFHC copper (provided it is not too close
to the hot cathode) are compatible as adjacent materi-
als inside an electron gun and do not induce poisoning
of the cathode. Reliable commercial suppliers exist in
the market. Compared to alternative cathode materials
(e.g., IrCe or crystalline materials), barium-impregnated
dispenser-type cathodes oﬀer longer lifetimes, more sta-
ble emission behavior, resilience against experimental ac-
cidents, and a lower operation temperature. In particular
the latter advantage eases constrains on the choice of ad-
jacent materials in the electron gun, allows for a better
residual pressure there, and allows for a higher electron
beam compression in a given magnetic ﬁeld according to
Herrmann’s optical theory146.

2. Pierce-geometry on-axis electron gun

With its open structure, our new on-axis electron-gun
design aims at being even more sturdy against unex-
pected thermal loads, voltage spikes, and discharges than
our earlier models. This is particularly important for
the parts that are close to the cathode, since gaps have
to be small. The Pierce-type148 electron gun (shown in
Fig. 6) is, despite the rotational symmetry of the elec-
trodes around the electron beam, rotationally asymmet-

It employs a
3.4 mm-diameter thermionic barium-impregnated tung-
sten dispenser cathode (type ‘M’ coating) with a concave
spherical radius of 8.2 mm, which is clamped between
two molybdenum parts. An OFHC copper anode, a
molybdenum focus electrode, the cathode assembly, and
a stainless-steel base are stacked along three alumina-
ceramic rods (A in Fig. 6) with small dimensional tol-
erances to deﬁne the centering of the electrodes. These
rods also act as spacers between anode and base. The
cathode assembly is tightened with two threaded rods to
the base against alumina-ceramic tubes (B) which elec-
trically insulate and set the correct distances. Thinner
alumina-ceramic tubes (C) avoid spark-over to adjacent
metal parts. The focus electrode and anode are similarly
and independently clamped to the cathode assembly. An-
ode, focus electrode, and cathode are contacted on the
back of the electron gun by shims on which wires are
spot-welded. The cathode-heater ﬁlament is contacted
with a triangular plate on the back of the cathode as-
sembly through a lateral pin. All threaded rods, screws,
and nuts near the cathode are made from molybdenum
to resist the high temperature of the cathode of around
1400 K during operation. A crucial prerequisite for a re-
liable and strong long-term emission current, Ib, is a very
low local residual pressure. The chosen open gun struc-
ture allows good pumping to facilitate this. The anode,
with an aperture of 5 mm, is located at a distance of 5 mm
in front of the cathode and controls the emission current
independently of the potential diﬀerence between cath-
ode and trap-center electrode, determining the beam en-
ergy in the trap. Between cathode and anode, the focus
electrode compensates potential distortions to improve
the beam transport. Furthermore, the focus-electrode
voltage is dynamically adjusted to stabilize the emitted
electron-beam current to better than ∆Ib/Ib ≈ 10−4 on
a > 100 ms time scale to suppress long-term drifts when
performing hour-long measurements. At the beginning
of a measurement series, the gun position is carefully
adjusted to optimize the current, current density, and
beam transmission. For this, the electron gun is mounted
on the far end of a horizontal titanium rod attached to
an XYZ-manipulator by a universal joint on a DN40CF
ﬂange, also holding the high-voltage (HV) feedthroughs
for the gun. The rod angle is set by a vertical, linear
manipulator which supports the rod with a pivot point
located roughly at the middle of the rod. Moreover, the
gun can be completely retracted, sliding on ball bearings
on that pivot point, into a dedicated gun chamber, which
can be separated from the main chamber with a gate

erated more than 80 mA of electron-beam current with-
out approaching the temperature limit of the thermionic
cathode.

3. Oﬀ-axis electron gun

In the last decade, photoexcitation and photoioniza-
tion in EBITs have become reliable techniques for in-
vestigating HCIs. The energy resolution in such studies
allows to resolve the natural line widths of the transi-
tions involved and to study asymmetric line proﬁles due
to quantum interference. Monoenergetic x-ray photon
beams from both free-electron lasers12,112,113 and syn-
chrotron radiation sources107–111 have been used for this
purpose. Optical laser spectroscopy inside an EBIT has
also been demonstrated103,106. Usually, the preferred
method for these types of experiments is introducing the
photon beam through the collector along the trap axis,
since a maximum overlap of the photon beam and the
trapped HCI cloud is desirable. As a consequence, the
photon beam is dumped onto the electron gun and, ac-
cordingly, discarded. Further disadvantages are vacuum
degradation and HV problems, since the photon beam
can excessively produce photoelectrons at some of the
electron-gun electrodes. Sputtered ions and pressure in-
creases may damage the cathode and reduce its lifetime.
Furthermore, alignment can be diﬃcult.

To solve these problems we have developed a novel
oﬀ-axis electron gun as an alternative to the on-axis
gun and equipped PolarX-EBIT with it. Hence, a pho-
ton beam can propagate through PolarX-EBIT without
any obstructions while being axially overlapped with the
trapped HCIs. For this reason, the cathode is separated
from the trap axis by tilting it by an angle of 22 ◦ with
respect to the horizontal plane (see Fig. 7(b)). Directly
mounted on a precisely machined Macor insulator, the
cathode is located 9.5 mm in front of the anode. To
optimize the deﬂection and focusing capability of the
gun in the magnetic ﬁeld, we simulated the electrostatic
potentials and electron trajectories, using the software
SIMION (see Figs. 7(b) and 8 for visualization of such
simulations). For steering the electron beam onto the
trap axis, the anode is split into two separate electrodes
by a 35 ◦-plane with respect to the horizontal plane at the
intercept of the electron beam (see Fig. 7(b)). Whereas
the rear anode is used to deﬁne the extraction potential
inside the gun, the front anode is used to bend the beam
into the horizontal to direct it towards the trap center.
Since the electrons emerge non-coaxially to the magnetic
ﬁeld lines, their trajectories are deﬂected sideways due
to the Lorentz force. To compensate for this, the focus
element surrounding the cathode is vertically cut into
two mirror-symmetric electrodes (left and right focus) on
which diﬀerent potentials are applied. Additionally, the
focus electrodes are also used, similarly as for the on-axis
gun, to regulate the emission current. These electrodes
are mounted on the insulating Macor carrier. Owing to
the high temperature of the nearby cathode, the focus
electrodes are made of molybdenum. The rear and front
anodes, in turn, are mounted on the focus electrodes and
the Macor carrier by alumina-ceramic rods as spacers.
They are made of OFHC copper to distribute the possi-

tial (see Fig. 4(c)). Six independent drift tubes (DT1 to
DT6, manufactured of grade 5 titanium alloy) are stacked
along four alumina-ceramic rods (A in Fig. 9, diameter
of 3 mm), which center these electrodes and terminate on
either side in stainless-steel rings. Seven pairs of alumina-
ceramic rods (B) (diameter of 2 mm), precisely cut to the
correct length, set the diﬀerent distances between the
drift tubes and the stainless-steel rings as well as electri-
cally insulate them, accounting for appropriate creeping
distances. Two twisted copper wires, guided within a
groove in each of the rings and slots ﬁled on the ceramic
rods (A) on either side, keep this asymmetric 100 mm-
long assembly together. After assembling, the trumpet
of DT1 is screwed with its outside thread into the body
of DT1. Flexible silver-plated copper wires are used for
connecting the drift tubes by M1.6 set screws. The wires
need to be preinstalled since their electrode contact is not
accessible after installation. Thin ceramic tubes (C) are
used for insulating them within the 16-mm bore of the
central vacuum chamber. Next, the assembly is inserted
into this bore and clamped together by two stainless-steel
holders on either side, pushing against the outer stainless-
steel rings of the assembly. The central trap electrode
(DT4) occupies the position of maximum magnetic ﬂux
density and establishes a potential well of an eﬀective
trap length of 22 mm together with DT3 and DT5 (see
Fig. 4). Four slits of 2.5 mm height by 16 mm length are
aligned with the four DN40CF cube-side ports. To reduce
reach-through from the ground chamber potential, the
electrode apertures are covered with an electro-formed
stainless-steel mesh of 2 mm × 2 mm grid size. This ge-
ometry oﬀers an opening angle of 58◦ for each DN40CF
port. One port is needed for HV feedthroughs and pump-
ing. Another port is used for an atomic beam for trap
loading. The two remaining ports are available for ﬂu-
orescence detectors and spectrometers. Potentials ap-
plied to the ﬁrst three drift tubes are tuned to optimize
electron-beam focusing at the trap center (see Fig. 4(c)).

E. Collector

After passing the positively biased drift-tube section,
the electron beam enters a region at ground potential and
is therefore slowed down. Finally, it is dumped on the in-
side of a hollow water-cooled collector electrode (OFHC
copper) (see Figs. 4 and 10). The magnetic ﬁeld strength
at the collector is much lower than at the trap center,
and thus the electron beam expands again and hits the
wall. Behind the collector electrode, two extraction elec-
trodes are installed. The ﬁrst one has to be biased to a
more negative potential than the cathode to prevent the
electron beam from passing through the collector. Fur-
thermore, both tubes are also used as ion optics for HCI
extraction.

The collector is made of two copper parts, the inner
collector electrode and the outer shell, enclosing a vol-
ume for cooling water. These elements and the cop-

FIG. 7. Cross-sectional views of the oﬀ-axis electron gun.
The cathode (yellow) points at an angle of 22◦ to the trap
axis to allow an external photon beam to pass through the
unobstructed central bore. The mirror-symmetric focus elec-
trodes (light blue and blue) compensate for the drift of the
electron beam due to the Lorentz force. Bending of the elec-
tron beam onto the trap axis is realized by splitting the anode
into a rear (red) and a front (orange) electrode, cut by a 35◦-
plane with respect to the horizontal. Simulated electrostatic
potential lines (black) and electron beam trajectories (blue)
are also shown in (b). See text for further details.

ble heat load by scattered electrons.

The central bore of the oﬀ-axis gun along the trap
axis is 4 mm wide and, thus, in accordance with the re-
quirements of typical photon beam diameters of less than
1 mm. The alignment with the aim to maximize the over-
lap between the photon and the electron beam for a high
signal rate is eased by, ﬁrst, the short trap length of our
compact EBIT and, second, the capability to image the
photon beam after passing through the EBIT.

D. Drift tubes

A set of cylindrical electrodes (drift tubes) accelerates
and guides the electron beam towards the collector (see
Fig. 4(b)) and also shapes the axial ion-trapping poten-

to the unobstructed trap axis, photon beams can pass through the EBIT, injected either from the gun or the collector side.

per pipes for water inlet and outlet are electron-beam
welded together. The collector, an aluminum mounting
plate, and the two extraction tubes (OFHC copper) are
stacked by using alumina-ceramic rods as spacers and two
threaded rods to clamp the assembly together. Further
ceramic shims and ceramic tubes around the water pipes
are used for electrical insulation. Stainless-steel hydro-
formed, braze-soldered ﬂexible-bellow hoses connect the
collector piping to insulated ﬂuid feedthroughs. These
feedthroughs lead the current deposited by the electron
beam to the outside. The collector ﬂange is mounted on
its DN63CF side to the central vacuum chamber while
it widens on the other side to DN100CF for attaching
further extraction elements and a beamline. There, a
300 l/s turbomolecular pump (TMP) can be installed to
pump the collector section from the back. Inside the cen-
tral vacuum chamber, the collector assembly is mounted
with the mounting plate. Two safe-high-voltage (SHV)
connectors are welded on the collector ﬂange for bias-
ing the extraction tubes. The electrical insulation of the
collector also allows for biasing it, provided a protect-
ing enclosure is installed. However, in the current setups
it was operated very close to ground potential by con-
necting it through a 10 Ω resistor or an ampere-meter
measuring the current Icol for evaluating the transmis-

sion T = Icol/Ib. This is a key indicator for the quality
of the electron beam, with typical values of T ≈ 99 %.
The missing current lost to the electron-gun anode and
the six drift tubes is monitored and minimized during
voltage adjustment.

F. Pumping and injection system

A low residual gas pressure is an essential prerequisite
for achieving and keeping high charge states. We use a
cascaded TMP system to achieve an ultra-high vacuum
(UHV) at the low 10−9 mbar level: Four TMPs (prefer-

for the collector and 70 l/s for the injection system, or
better) share downstream a common intermediate high-
vacuum stage, which is pumped by a single 70 l/s wide-
range TMP, backed by an oil-free scroll pump. The use of
this two-stage TMP system raises the compression ratio
for H2 by more than three orders of magnitude and pre-
vents serious problems caused by a failure of either the
intermediate TMP or one of the UHV TMPs. In the ﬁrst
case, the scroll pump can maintain the required backing
pressure for the UHV TMPs. In the second one, the small
intermediate TMP still manages to keep a vacuum in the
10−6 mbar range in the EBIT. Then, a vacuum-interlock
safety system automatically turns oﬀ HV power supplies
and the cathode heating unit. This level of protection is
suﬃcient to prevent the cathode from permanent dam-
age at the price of introducing the intermediate high-
vacuum stage TMP. Additional protection is provided
by a solenoid valve at the inlet of the scroll pump.
It
closes in case of a power failure and maintains, together
with the forelines, a level of vacuum which is suitable
for the continuing operation of the TMPs during their
spin down. Again, the vacuum-interlock system immedi-
ately switches oﬀ the power supplies and also keeps them
switched oﬀ when power is suddenly restored, up to their
manual restart.
In this way, the cathode has enough
time to cool down, since this process takes many min-
utes. Hot-cathode ion gauges are installed in the various
chamber parts to monitor the pressure.

For immediate operation of the HC-EBITs after a
transport between laboratories or cities, the electron gun
can be isolated with gate valves in UHV in its own
chamber. This protects the cathode from degradation
and avoids a time-consuming re-activation after arrival.
Additionally, we have installed a non-evaporable getter
(NEG) pump close to the gun for the PolarX-EBIT to
maintain a UHV pressure for an extended period with-
out electrical power.

The gas-injection system has two UHV pumping stages
to deliver a very low-density atomic or molecular beam to
the central drift tube in order to introduce the element of
choice into the EBIT. An UHV needle valve is connected
to the ﬁrst UHV stage, pumped by the aforementioned
70 l/s TMP. There, the pressure is typically in the range
of 10−6 to 10−8 mbar. An aperture of 2 mm diameter
allows the beam to enter the second UHV stage, which
is pumped by the TMP attached to the central chamber.
Moreover, Tip-EBIT uses an implementation of the wire-
probe method76 in order to deliver minuscule quantities
of heavy elements for ionization. The wire probe will be
used for the study of rare isotopes.

III. OPERATION AND MEASUREMENTS

A. Commissioning

All devices of the HC-EBIT type showed a similar
behavior during commissioning. At the beginning, the
brand-new cathode is carefully heated up in a stepwise
manner to the required activation temperature over a
couple of days, dubbed ‘conditioning’. This process
causes a slow diﬀusion of the impregnants, driven by the
high temperature and the concentration gradient, dur-
ing which the barium aluminate reacts with some addi-
tives contained in the cathode, e.g., calcium oxide, and
forms barium. Due to its low work function (≈ 2 eV),
this substance builds a very eﬃcient emission layer at
the exterior surface of the cathode. The cathode sup-
pliers recommend not to exceed a certain heating cur-
rent since the type ‘M’ coating evaporates at too high
temperature. At higher values the cathode itself can be
damaged. However, due to the open gun structure, the
coupling through thermal radiation to the environment
is relatively good and we expect to be clearly below the
temperature limit. Because of the initial heating of the
cathode and its environment, the pressure, measured by
the gauge which is installed at the gun chamber, ap-
proaches the 10−7 mbar range while the pressure mea-
sured at the collector remains in the 10−9 mbar range.
Increased ion bombardment of the cathode emission layer
due to residual gas pressure removes some of the emit-
ting barium and counteracts the diﬀusion process of the
barium from the tungsten-matrix reservoir – initially lim-
iting the maximum emission current.

After a few weeks of operation, the chemical-physical
formation of the dispenser-cathode material has com-
pleted, the parts immediately surrounding the cathode
have out-gassed, and the cathode heating can be reduced
to prolong the lifetime, while maintaining the emission
current. This process can be accelerated by baking the
whole device while cooling the permanent magnets us-
ing the water-cooling of the protecting aluminum car-
tridges. After vacuum conditions have consistently im-
proved (low 10−9 mbar pressure at the gun), currents of
up to 80 mA for the on-axis gun and up to 30 mA for
the oﬀ-axis gun could be achieved. Nonetheless, some of
the commissioning measurements presented below were
obtained at lower currents, either because of a higher
residual gas pressure at the beginning or intentionally to
achieve higher electron-beam energy resolution.

Electrical discharges between the gun electrodes can
temporarily reduce or completely eliminate the emission
layer. Reconditioning of the cathode layer after recov-
ery of good vacuum conditions can be achieved, in most
cases,
in a matter of seconds or minutes. However,
extended, strong discharges can completely sputter the
emission layer or cover it with other materials from neigh-
boring electrodes. Such an incident can require many
hours or even days of reconditioning at higher cathode-
heating current, until the contaminating layers have been

11

by ﬁne positioning the gun and adjusting the drift-tube
voltages. The reason for the anode current is essentially a
partial reﬂection of the strongly focused electron beam by
the strong magnetic-ﬁeld gradient, hindering the electron
beam from entering the drift-tube region. Consequently,
the anode collects the largest part of the reﬂected beam,
since it is biased more positively than any other part
there. Therefore, the anode current is a proxy for the
quality of both the geometric alignment and the volt-
age adjustments. Once these steps are completed, hav-
ing a typical transmission of 99 % and a current loss to
the anode and each drift tube well below 0.5 mA (even
at emission currents of 80 mA), the anode voltage can
be increased to obtain the desired electron-beam cur-
rent. Possibly, the gun position, the focus voltage and
the drift tube voltages may need some readjustments
then. The geometric alignment is very reproducible and
hardly varies for a wide range of electron-beam energies
and currents. However, for each beam energy adjust-
ments of the drift-tube and electron-gun potentials may
be needed. Generally, also these parameters are reliably
reproducible and can be maintained at constant values
during long measurements.

The perveance P = Ib/U 3/2 is an important quantity
to describe the relation between beam current Ib and
extraction voltage U for space-charge limited, charged
particle beams. In particular, it is often used to qualify
the performance of electron guns. According to Child-
Langmuir’s law149,150 it is essentially determined by two
geometrical quantities for a given particle beam: the di-
ameter of the extracted beam and the distance between
cathode and anode. For our on-axis electron gun we ex-
pect a perveance on the order of 1 µperv with the 3.4
mm-diameter cathode. However, in practice this rela-
tion is not always fully applicable due to geometrical
deviations and experimental conditions, for instance, in
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld when the gun is op-
erated in an EBIT. Fig. 11 shows the emission cur-
rent as a function of the electron-gun extraction voltage,
i.e., the diﬀerence between anode and cathode voltage
while the focus electrode is operated at cathode poten-
tial. Fitting the data of 1.28 A cathode-heating current,
the gun operating in the space-charge limited regime, we
can conﬁrm an electron-gun perveance on the order of
1 µperv. Note that the electron-beam current of the HC-
EBITs, adjusted and regulated by the anode and focus-
electrode voltages, respectively, is widely independent of
the electron-beam energy which is determined by the
voltage diﬀerence between trap electrode and cathode.
The measurement was carried out with 3.6 keV beam en-
ergy, for instance.

2. Oﬀ-axis electron gun

In ﬁrst tests of the oﬀ-axis gun, the electrostatic de-
ﬂection of the emitted electron beam was analyzed in a
non-magnetic environment. In this setup, the electrons

FIG. 11. Perveance measurement of the HC-EBIT on-axis
electron gun. For two diﬀerent cathode-heating currents, the
emission current is shown as a function of the extraction volt-
age, i.e., the voltage diﬀerence between anode and cathode
while the focus electrode was kept on cathode voltage. A heat-
ing with 1.21 A (blue squares) indicates emission not being
fully space-charge limited. The ﬁt function Ib = a U c yields
the parameter a = 0.78(2) × 10−6 A/Vc and c = 1.428(3) for
the higher-temperature data (red circles).

evaporated and a fresh barium emission layer has formed
through permeation out of the reservoir. More serious
problems can arise if an accidental leak occurs. In such
cases, an vacuum-interlock system should instantly turn
oﬀ the cathode heating and the high voltages applied to
all the electrodes. Depending on how high the pressure
rises during such an event and how long a high cath-
ode temperature was maintained before restoring good
vacuum conditions, several days of slow emission-current
recovery can be required. In the worst case, the damage
to the cathode is permanent.

1. On-axis electron gun

The Pierce-type electron guns operate in the space-
charge limited regime. Appropriate high voltages have
to be applied to the diﬀerent electrodes. Typically, the
focus electrode is initially biased to a more negative value
than the cathode, thus completely blocking the emission.
The anode voltage can be kept on ground or a low posi-
tive potential of only a few hundred volts. By increasing
the focus voltage, emission slowly starts and the position
of the electron gun can be adjusted aiming at maximum
transmission all the way through the drift tubes to the
electron collector by monitoring the emission current and
the collector current. A rough positioning of the gun was
always suﬃcient to immediately measure electron-beam
current on the collector. In a second step, the current loss
to the anode and the diﬀerent drift tubes are minimized

hit a phosphor-coated screen mounted in front of the gun.
By changing the potentials of the electrodes, the electron
beam could be steered along the horizontal and verti-
cal direction independently. The focussing of the beam
could be adjusted by changing the bias voltage of the fo-
cus electrodes. Then, the oﬀ-axis gun was mounted on
an XYZ-manipulator and installed in the PolarX-EBIT.
The manipulator allows positioning of the gun at the
magnetic-ﬁeld minimum, a crucial requirement. Starting
with electrode potentials and a gun position optimized
by simulations, the cathode emitted already electrons
and the beam could be partially transmitted through the
EBIT to the collector. After a manual optimization, sta-
ble beams with electron losses below 1 % were achieved.
The Lorentz deﬂection strongly depends on the gun
position. If the cathode is misaligned, compensating the
beam drift calls for a voltage diﬀerence between the two
focus electrodes of up to 50 V. Its optimal value does
not strongly depend on the voltage diﬀerence between
cathode and anode. The potential between front and rear
anode, required for proper electron-beam steering, is in
good agreement with the simulations. Positive voltages
at the front anode are approximately half of those applied
to the rear anode, a ratio which is not much aﬀected
by the electron-beam current. However, if the voltage
diﬀerence between cathode and rear anode is increased,
i.e., essentially the beam energy is increased inside the
gun, the voltage applied to the front anode also needs to
be increased.

PolarX-EBIT was operated with stable electron beams
from a few hundred eV up to 8000 eV energy at the trap
center. The cathode could be biased down to -4000 V, the
limit of the cathode power supply. Stable space-charge
limited currents of up to 30 mA were achieved, limited
by the maximum voltage diﬀerence between cathode and
rear anode while a proper deﬂection of the electron beam
onto the trap axis was still possible.

B. HCI extraction

To test ion breeding and extraction, we installed the
prototype of the HC-EBITs at a beamline with charge-

state separation and detection. This device has a slightly
lower magnetic ﬁeld of 0.74 T at the trap center, uses an
older gun design, and delivered electron-beam currents of
a few mA at the time of the tests. Fig. 12 illustrates the
beamline setup. The HCIs leave the EBIT through an ex-
traction electrode behind the collector (cf. Fig. 4(b)) and
pass through a special, segmented einzel lens, dubbed
Sikler lens, similar to our previous design151,152. The
Sikler lens allows focusing and steering of the ion beam
in spite of its short length. It forms a collimated beam
towards a Wien-type velocity ﬁlter for separation accord-
ing to the charge-to-mass ratio q/m. The electric ﬁeld of
the Wien ﬁlter is scanned for q/m analysis using alterna-
tively either a Faraday cup measuring ion currents or a
position-sensitive detector comprised of a microchannel
plate (MCP) and a phosphor screen (PS), imaged onto a
charge-coupled device camera (CCD).

For operating the EBIT in pulsed mode, an axial
trap depth of up to 100 V is applied. At the cost of a
high ion temperature, this allows to breed high charge
states. By rapidly switching the trapping potential, an
HCI bunch is released. We tested this mode with ar-
gon (see Figs. 13(a) and 13(b)) and isotopically enriched
xenon-129 (see Fig. 14(a)). We also carried out contin-
uous extraction (‘leaky’ mode) with the prototype us-
ing a shallow axial trapping potential. Hereby, ions of
the hot tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution over-
come the axial trapping-potential barrier continuously.

C. Dielectronic recombination

Dielectronic recombination153 (DR) is a resonant in-
teraction process of a free electron with an ion. The for-
mer one, having a kinetic energy of Ekin, is captured
into an open shell of the latter one with binding en-
ergy EB while a second, bound electron is excited to a
higher level with energy diﬀerence ∆E by the released
energy Ekin + EB – fulﬁlling the resonance condition
∆E = Ekin + EB. A resulting excited, short-lived in-
termediate state is stabilized either by autoionization or
radiative decay. KLL DR (notation akin to the Auger
nomenclature referring to the electronic shells involved)
is illustrated in Fig. 15 for an initially He-like ion. Ob-
servation of KLL DR is an excellent diagnostic of the
charge-state distribution143, since the energies of charge-
state-resolved resonances are often well known. Hence,
we carried out DR measurements on iron with the HC-
EBITs, injecting an Fe-containing organometallic com-
pound. While scanning the electron-beam energy over
the KLL resonances, a high-purity germanium detector
counted the Kα photons, which were emitted by stabi-
lizing the intermediate state. Fig. 16 presents results for
two diﬀerent HC-EBITs, the PTB-EBIT featuring the
on-axis electron gun (upper panel) and the PolarX-EBIT
utilizing the novel oﬀ-axis electron gun (lower panel) with
electron-beam currents of 14 mA and 15.1 mA, respec-
tively. The appearing resonances give clear evidence of
high charge states up to He-like Fe24+. The HC-EBITs
reach a remarkably high electron-beam energy resolution
of E/∆E > 1500 for low electron-beam currents, even
improving on that of previous work using evaporative
cooling in cryogenic EBITs97,98. Arguably, this could be
interpreted as a consequence of the higher residual gas
pressure in the room-temperature HC-EBITs which pro-
vides low-atomic number HCIs for evaporative cooling by
default.

Fig. 14(b) shows results for 129Xe. Table I summarizes
the main results of these experiments. The HCI charge-
state distribution for the injected elements, and further
peaks from molecular and atomic ions arising from resid-
ual gas, are visible in the ﬁgures. A superimposed, dif-
fuse background between 0.03 and 0.06 e/u corresponds
to ions not originating from the trap-center potential.
With a 4 mA, 2.8 keV electron beam, Fig. 13(a) shows
all Ar charge states up to the He-like Ar16+, the high-
est accessible charge state for Ar at that electron-beam

HCI bunch spatially separated at low Wien-ﬁlter disper-
sion displaying simultaneously all produced charge states.

tribution at once. Extraction of much heavier 129Xe

with the electron mass me, charge e, and velocity vz, as
well as the Boltzmann constant kB.

Accordingly, in the magnetic ﬁeld of 0.86 T at the trap
center, as shown in Fig. 4(a), the electron-beam radius
is compressed down to 72 µm, assuming a cathode tem-
perature of 1400 K, a cathode diameter of 3.4 mm, an
electron-beam current of 80 mA, an electron-beam en-
ergy of 5 keV, and a residual magnetic ﬁeld at the posi-
tion of the cathode of about or even below 100 µT. The
latter one is a reasonable assumption, since the structure
of the magnetic ﬁeld causes a true minimum where the
ﬁeld direction reverses. The minimum is only slightly
shifted by the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld or a weak magnetic
background ﬁeld in the laboratory. Photographic images
of the ion cloud under electron-beam excitation (as dis-
played on the inset of Fig. 2) are, in spite of their limited
spatial resolution, consistent with a radius below 150 µm.
Based on the Herrmann radius of 72 µm, and also guided
by the ionization eﬃciency, we estimate an approximate
current density of 500 A/cm2 and an electron density of
7 × 1011 /cm3 at 5 keV beam energy.

FIG. 16. Dielectronic recombination of iron ions. The Kα
photons produced by the de-excitation of the intermediate
hole states, populated by resonant dielectronic capture, were
counted with a high-purity Ge detector while scanning the
electron-beam energy. Shown are raw data, uncorrected for
the space-charge potential and the inﬂuence of adjacent po-
tentials. Since the KLL dielectronic recombination of Fe is
well known98, the charge states can be unambiguously as-
signed. The upper panel shows a measurement with PTB-
EBIT and the on-axis electron gun with a 14 mA electron
beam, while the lower panel shows a measurement of PolarX-
EBIT equipped with the oﬀ-axis electron gun operated with
15.1 mA.

The electron-beam energy was limited by the power
supplies to 10 kV so far. Higher values of up to 15 kV
are likely to be possible in the future with other supplies
and possibly exchanging HV feedthroughs. If required,
modiﬁcations of the designs and lengths of the insulating
parts can be implemented to increase creeping distances.
The energy shifts as a function of the electron-beam
current observed in DR measurements by the space-
charge potential of the electron beam and trapped
ions at a trap depth of 10 eV were measured to be
0.397(8) eV/mA at about 2.2 keV electron-beam energy
of argon KLL DR and 0.505(3) eV/mA at about 4.8 keV
of iron KLL DR.

2. Oﬀ-axis electron gun

The observation of DR in argon at an electron-beam
current of 10 mA while varying the nominal trap depth,
i.e., the diﬀerence of the applied voltages of the central
trap electrode and the two adjacent drift tubes, allows for
a coarse estimate of the electron-beam radius through the
electronic space-charge potential Φe, though Φe is par-
tially compensated by the positive space-charge potential

The sum of these two contribu-
tions is the total space-charge potential Φtot = Φe + Φi
and reduces the nominal electron-beam energy, deﬁned
by the acceleration voltage applied to the electrodes.
Solving Poisson’s equation by assuming, for simplicity,
an inﬁnitely long electron beam propagating coaxially to
the trap axis with a top-hat charge density, the electronic
space-charge potential only depends on the separation r
from the axis (see also77,80) and is given by

is the potential diﬀerence between the edge of the electron
beam and the trap axis. Ib is the electron-beam current,
vz the electron’s velocity, and (cid:15)0 the vacuum permittivity.
The total space charge Φtot was determined by mea-
suring the shifts in the nominal electron-beam energy, at
which the DR resonances appear, as a function of the
electron-beam current. A value of 0.462(9) eV/mA was
obtained154, yielding a negative value of Φtot = −4.6 eV
for a 10 mA electron beam.

The space-charge contribution Φi of the trapped ions,
at this constant electron-beam current of 10 mA, could
be estimated by increasing the nominal trap depth from
a trapping condition to its inversion and even higher,
to, ﬁrst, gradually reduce the number of trapped ions
and, then, push transient ions out of the trap volume.
In addition to the trap depth, the electron-beam energy
was repeatedly scanned as the second parameter of this
measurement to cover the argon KLL DR resonances.
Fig. 17 shows the Kα ﬂuorescence as a function of both,
the nominal trap depth and the nominal electron-beam
energy, calibrated with atomic structure calculations us-
ing the Flexible Atomic Code155. The loss of positive
charges when ﬂatten the trap, resulting in a change of the
space-charge potential and, therefore, in a shift of the res-
onance positions on the electron-beam energy axis, is not
very large until a nominal trap depth of +13(2) V when
the trapped HCIs begin to escape along the trap axis.
From here, the space-charge compensation is noticeably
decreased and a signiﬁcantly higher nominal electron-
beam energy is needed to fulﬁll the DR resonance condi-
tion. At a nominal trap depth of +250 V, only a few ions
are still present and the Kα ﬂuorescence is very weak.
The diﬀerence of the required nominal electron-beam en-
ergy between the beginning of emptying the trap at the

FIG. 17. Dielectronic recombination of argon ions with con-
stant 10 mA electron-beam current as a function of the nomi-
nal electron-beam energy, deﬁned by the applied acceleration
potentials, and the nominal trap depth for storing the ions,
i.e., the diﬀerence between the applied voltages of central trap
electrode and adjacent drift tubes. The resonances are as-
signed to their corresponding charge states. Depending on the
trap depth, the number of stored ions and, consequently, their
positive space-charge contribution change. Hence, the nom-
inal electron-beam energies at which the resonances appear
shift. At +13 V nominal trap depth, the trap starts losing
ions, strongly aﬀecting charge-state distribution, resonance
intensities and space-charge compensation. The space-charge
contribution of the ions was determined to 22(2) eV. See text
for further details.

nominal depth of +13 eV and the end of this process
is determined to a value of 22(2) eV. This is our esti-
mate for the space-charge contribution Φi of the ions at
10 mA electron-beam current. By subtracting this value
from Φtot = −4.6 eV and taking an electrostatic reach-
through of 1.2 V into account, we can infer the electronic
space-charge potential Φe ≈ −25.4 eV. However, the to-
tal space-charge potential within the electron-beam ra-
dius re is essentially ﬂat due to the presence of the com-
pensating ions, and therefore −25.4 eV is our assumption
for Φe(re). Using Eq. 4, we calculate an upper bound
for the electron-beam radius of rb ≤ 74(30) µm. Using
Eq. 1 from Herrmann’s theory, we can conﬁrm operating
the cathode in a residual magnetic ﬁeld on the order of
BC ≈ 1 mT . This is in good agreement with the simu-
lated and measured magnetic ﬁeld, considering the oﬀ-
axis geometry and a possible misalignment. According
to Herrmann’s theory, the radius of such a compressed
electron beam only increases by less than 2 µm when
increasing the electron-beam current to 30 mA. Conse-
quently, we expect achievable current densities of more
than 170 A/cm2 with a 30 mA electron beam of the oﬀ-
axis electron gun.

or the continuous operation of cryocoolers, an HC-EBIT
has a much reduced cost of construction and operation. It
achieves, in spite of its compact size, the functionality of
a traditional superconducting EBIT in many aspects. A
large solid angle for detectors compensates for the lower
electron currents and shorter trap dimensions to some
degree. Mechanical vibrations from cryocoolers are elim-
inated. For many experiments in which an electron-beam
energy below 10 keV and current below 100 mA are suf-
ﬁcient, an HC-EBIT can be employed more conveniently
than its larger relatives. At the presently tested param-
eters one can expect to produce and study up to H-like
iron, and He-like or Li-like ions up to Xe.
Once adjusted for an experiment,

the HC-EBITs
have demonstrated stable operation over months without
readjustment. This renders these EBITs particularly at-
tractive for the use as a pulsed or continuous HCI source.
For instance, the prototype already successfully delivers
HCIs for the Penning-trap experiment ALPHATRAP121
aiming at g-factor determination of the bound electron,
PTB-EBIT will provide HCIs for a cryogenic Paul trap
to carry out quantum logic spectroscopy testing HCI-
based optical atomic clock applications, and Tip-EBIT is
equipped with a wire-probe76 for rare-isotope injection to
supply those HCIs to the Penning trap PENTATRAP119
where precision mass measurements will be performed.

For spectroscopic applications, the HC-EBITs oﬀers
excellent optical access with a large opening angle along
the trap axis. Optical, VUV, and x-ray detectors as well
as optics for spectrometers, all can be mounted at close
distance of only a few centimeters from the HCI cloud.
This proximity and the subsequently possible large solid
angles are more troublesome to achieve in superconduct-
ing EBITs due to the thermal shielding of the cryogenic
parts. Similarly, it seems easier to adopt other EBIT
techniques like the wire-probe method76 for rare-isotope
studies. If the desired charge state can be achieved and
signal intensity is suﬃcing, the seemingly disadvanta-
geous low electron-beam current provides a higher res-
olution since the electron-beam energy spread Φ0 due to
the electronic space charge (see Eq. 5) is reduced and
the HCIs are less heated, resulting in a reduced Doppler
broadening.

Moreover, PolarX-EBIT, now installed at the PETRA
III synchrotron, was speciﬁcally developed for measure-
ment campaigns at synchrotron or FEL facilities, provid-
ing HCIs as target for x-ray photons. Dedicated to this
purpose we have designed and built a unique oﬀ-axis elec-
tron gun which allows for clear through access along the
axially extended HCI cloud. An external photon beam
can pass through the EBIT without being blocked and
being available for a downstream experiment, facilitating
operation of the EBIT in a parasitic mode with negligi-
ble transmission loss. Photon-energy calibration based
on HCIs and photon-polarization diagnostics through the
anisotropic angular emission become possible with the
potential of providing an atomic absolute wavelength
standard in this spectral region. Transport and instal-

FIG. 18. Resonant photoexcitation of electronic transitions
in highly charged oxygen. The number of ﬂuorescence events,
recorded with two silicon drift detectors, is shown as a func-
tion of the photon beam energy. Five resonances of He- and
Li-like oxygen are observed.

E. Resonant photoexcitation

Operating the transportable FLASH-EBIT112 at FELs
or synchrotron light sources has demonstrated the feasi-
bility of resonant photoexcitation of electronic transitions
in trapped HCIs by employing the laser spectroscopy
technique in the XUV and x-ray regime12,107–113.
Tunable high-resolution monochromators allow high-
precision measurements of transition energies and nat-
ural line widths. Moreover, such light sources provide
femtosecond pulses. The PolarX-EBIT, with its novel
oﬀ-axis electron gun, has been designed for the purpose
of those experiments. We operated it at the BESSY II
synchrotron in Berlin, providing a cloud of highly charged
oxygen ions as target for the monochromatized x-ray
beam of beamline U49/2-PGM1. PolarX-EBIT was set
up with the electron beam collinear to the photon beam
and was equipped with silicon drift detectors to detect
the x-ray ﬂuorescence signal of the HCI cloud. After
coarse adjustment of the EBIT position using a YAG
crystal and a phosphor screen, the spatial overlap of ion
cloud and photon beam was optimized maximizing the
ﬂuorescence yield from the resonantly excited line w (fol-
lowing the nomenclature of Gabriel156) of He-like oxygen.
A typical diameter of the ion cloud of a few hundred mi-
crometers and an even smaller focus size of the photon
beam necessitated a positioning accuracy on the order
of 100 micrometers. By resonantly exciting electronic
transitions in He-like O6+ and Li-like O5+, as shown in
Fig. 18, we successfully demonstrated the application of
a room-temperature EBIT for high-resolution x-ray laser
spectroscopy. Details on the measurement campaign and
its results will be published elsewhere.

nient than that of a large superconducting EBIT such
as FLASH-EBIT112, and space requirements at a photon
beamline are signiﬁcantly relaxed.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have introduced the Heidelberg Com-
pact EBITs (HC-EBIT) as a novel class of compact room-
temperature devices. With possible electron-beam ener-
gies of up to 10 keV, more than 80 mA electron-beam
current, radial and axial access to the trapped HCIs, the
design has proven its suitability for studies of H-like HCIs
up to Fe, He-like and Li-like HCIs up to Xe, as well as
all intermediate charge states of heavy elements. Featur-
ing the novel oﬀ-axis gun, the operation at synchrotron
and FEL light sources allows for innovative experiments
with advanced photon-beam diagnostics based on atomic
systems.

The HC-EBITs should provide reliable access to HCIs
for a wide range of experiments, requiring much less ex-
pertise for its use, greatly reducing the investment and
cost of operation. Three devices, PTB-EBIT, PolarX-
EBIT, and Tip-EBIT, as well as the prototype are in
operation. Three more are currently under construction.
The HC-EBITs have already shown a performance com-
petitive with fully-ﬂedged superconducting EBITs in var-
ious applications. We are keen to share our design with
other research groups to facilitate new applications of
HCIs in, e. g., atomic physics, astrophysics, surface sci-
ence, and fundamental research.
