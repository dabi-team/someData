ABSTRACT

This paper presents two variations of architecture referred
to as RANet and BIRANet. The proposed architecture aims
to use radar signal data along with RGB camera images to
form a robust detection network that works efﬁciently, even
in variable lighting and weather conditions such as rain,
dust, fog, and others. First, radar information is fused in
the feature extractor network. Second, radar points are used
to generate guided anchors. Third, a method is proposed to
improve region proposal network [1] targets. BIRANet yields
72.3/75.3% average AP/AR on the NuScenes [2] dataset,
which is better than the performance of our base network
Faster-RCNN with Feature pyramid network(FFPN) [3].
RANet gives 69.6/71.9% average AP/AR on the same dataset,
which is reasonably acceptable performance. Also, both BI-
RANet and RANet are evaluated to be robust towards the
noise.

Index Terms— Object Detection, Radar Signals, Vision,
RGB Cameras, Fusion, Deep Learning, Autonomous Vehicle.

They are robust, reliable, and cheaper than LIDAR sensors.
Long-range object detection is beneﬁcial for autonomous ve-
hicles, especially commercial vehicles such as trucks, where
they need more time to slow down for an incoming obstacle or
object. Radar sensors and RGB cameras, make a very reliable
combination for object detection. Even after these signiﬁcant
merits of radar sensors, there is limited signiﬁcant research
work conducted on radar sensor and vision fusion.

In this paper, an architecture for object detection is intro-
duced, which utilizes RGB camera images and radar sensor
data. Radar points store location information of objects and
their distance from the sensor with high conﬁdence. We use
this high conﬁdence radar sensor information for better fea-
ture extraction and region proposals along with other intuitive
ideas. Proposed approaches are implemented to build a ro-
bust object detection network for the autonomous driving en-
vironment. For the demonstration of the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture, the NuScenes dataset is used, which
has recorded data from a full autonomous sensor suite(6 RGB
cameras, 1 LIDAR, 5 RADAR, GPS, IMU).

1. INTRODUCTION

2. RELATED WORK

With increasing demand and research in autonomous vehi-
cles, object detection has become a signiﬁcant task. RGB
images through cameras are the standard input of such ob-
ject detectors. However, bad weather conditions or dark envi-
ronment conditions distort the images or videos captured by
a camera in a driving scenario. Unpredictable environmen-
tal conditions make it troublesome for single modality based
object detectors to detect the object’s location, and it is cat-
egory precisely. To overcome this limitation, Vehicle indus-
tries are using different sensors in autonomous vehicles such
as LIDAR, radar, infrared cameras, and others. Each sen-
sor has it is own beneﬁts and drawbacks. However, LIDAR
and radar sensors have most commonly come into the pic-
ture when analyzed on the usability factor. LIDAR sensors
are highly efﬁcient in making 3d images of objects but at the
cost of the reliability issue. LIDAR has more moving parts
hence have room for more noise. Radar sensors, on the other
hand, provide very few points hence are not suitable for 3d ob-
ject image construction. However, radar sensors have a high
range, due to which they can detect objects at a long distance.

In autonomous vehicles, radar-based object detection is ex-
plored in work such as [4, 5, 6, 7]. All these works are
based on traditional techniques such as Haar-like features [8],
Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) [4], occupancy grid map [5],
and others. With the introduction of Convolutional Neural
Network(CNN), an informative representation of objects is
learned, and it shows drastic improvement in tasks such as
classiﬁcation and regression. CNN based object detectors are
very efﬁcient and common these days. Two-stage object de-
tectors generally overpower single-stage detectors in terms of
accuracy. The main strength of the two-stage object detector
is the region proposal network. Faster-RCNN [1] introduced
region proposal network(RPN) where they made network to
learn anchor proposals. RPN was a tremendous success in the
ﬁeld of object detection. RPN is further explored in multiple
works such as GA-RPN [9], Iterative RPN [10], Cascade
RPN [11], and others.

RPN is much explored on RGB camera images and very
less on radar data. However, there are few works such as [12],
where authors presented a 3D object detection network for car

 
 
 
 
 
 
detection using AVOD architecture on radar pointclouds and
camera images. Authors in [13], use range-doppler spec-
trums from FMCW radar signals and camera images for 3D
object detection and estimation.

Authors in [14], presented radar points-based anchors
where radar points are considered towards the center, left,
right, and bottom of the object. However, the authors did not
provide any speciﬁc reason for not considering the radar point
at the top of the object. The idea of radar point-based anchor
generation is accommodated in the presented work with some
intuitive changes.

3. PROPOSED OBJECT DETECTION NETWORK

The idea of sensor fusion is inspired by humans. We hu-
mans use multiple sensors to sense different attributes or
speciﬁcations, which are reﬁned together to come to a ﬁnal
observation. When it comes to artiﬁcial sensor fusion, the
same approach is followed.
In the proposed architecture,
input from RGB cameras and radar sensors are fused, re-
ﬁned, and processed for object detection. Two variations
of networks are proposed in this work, namely RANet and
BIRANet. Both follow the same architecture with two differ-
ences; First, RANet works only on radar point-based anchors.
However, BIRANet also utilizes anchors generated similar to
that in FFPN. Second, BIRANet has a different RPN target
generation method, ”Best of Two,” which is explained in sub-
section 3.4. Below is a detailed description of the proposed
architecture.

3.1. Radar + RGB Fusion

Radar sensors provide points, distance, velocity, azimuth, and
others. Radar points are in the 3D coordinate system(x,y,z)
where x and y coordinate of radar points provide the 2D loca-
tion of reﬂective objects in the view, and the third dimension
z corresponds to the distance of the object from the radar sen-
sor. Before feeding the radar data into the network, radar data

points are ﬁrst converted from vehicle coordinates to camera-
view coordinates, which will align radar points with the RGB
image. Second, radar points are resized and then converted
into a feature map of a size equivalent to that of the input im-
age. At each radar point location x, y of the feature map, the z
distance value is embedded and assign 0 to all other locations
where there is no radar point present. The resulting radar fea-

ture map is the input of radar feature extractor and has one
channel.

Fig. 2: Radar+RGB featuremap fusion. Small purple circles repre-
sents element-wise addition. Red dots in radar signal input represent
radar points.

In the proposed architecture, a separate radar feature ex-
tractor branch is formed, as represented in Fig 1. The idea
of residual network is adapted to extract radar features efﬁ-
ciently, and one convolution along with two identity blocks is
applied in the radar feature extractor branch. The radar fea-
ture extractor branch and RGB feature extractor branch are
fused in the feature extractor backbone. The feature extrac-
tor used for RGB images is ResNet [15]. While we exper-
imented with radar and RGB data fusion at different stages
of the feature extractor, the proposed conﬁguration shown in
Fig 2 proved to be the best. For fusion, element-wise addition
operation is performed on the output feature map of the radar
feature extractor branch and second stage output feature map
of the RGB feature extractor branch.

3.2. Attentive FPN

In Feature pyramid network(FPN) of FFPN 4 feature map
output, P2 to P5 are extracted from the feature extractor
backbone. Extracted feature maps are the features on which
the performance of the detection network is primarily based.
Hence these features have to be as good as possible. It is ex-
perimented and found that in the radar+RGB fused network,
the output feature maps can be boosted further with the help
of attention. With this motivation, an Attentive FPN is pro-
posed, which uses Concurrent Spatial and Channel Squeeze
& Excitation(scSE) blocks [16]. The scSE block acts as at-
tention and highlights important spatial features as well as
signiﬁcant channels.
In the attentive FPN, scSE attention
block is applied to the radar feature map. scSE blocks adap-
tively boost activation of areas where we have radar points
and suppress the activation at other locations. Boosted good
feature maps are then fused with RGB features map as shown
in Fig 2.

3.3. Radar Point-Based Anchors and RoIAlign Layer

Radar signals are reliable in providing an object’s location
even if they are far away hence have a long-range. When
radar points are superimposed on images, although radar sig-
nals do not point to all object’s in the image but incorporate
most of the objects and also those in long range. Therefore,
it is reasonable to use radar points for generating region pro-
posals. Another observation is that radar points are not only
present towards the center of the surface of the object but also
towards the top, bottom, left, and right edges of objects. Thus,
in a good proposal scheme, one cannot just consider the radar
point at the center of the bounding box but should also con-
sider the radar point on all four edges of the bounding box.

Anchor boxes are generated with 3 ratios (0.5, 1.0, 2.0) at
each radar point and with the consideration that each radar
point is at the top, down, left, right edge, and at the cen-
ter(TDLRC) of an anchor box, as shown in Figure 3.
In
RPN, Radar points are mapped to each output feature map
of FPN. Anchors for each radar point are extracted with dif-
ferent scales based on the level of the feature map.

In the region proposal network of FFPN, RoIPooling [3]
is used to obtain ﬁxed-size(e.g., 7X7) feature maps from each
region of interest. RoIPool, cause harsh quantization over fea-
tures which creates alignment issue between the input image
and extracted features. For a good point based proposals, it is
essential to have an accurate mapping of radar points in each
feature map. For feature alignment reason, the RoIPool layer
of FFPN is replaced with the RoIAlign [17] layer.

3.4. Best of Two - RPN Target Generation Method

In RPN target generation, anchors for each input image are
compared to the ground truth bounding boxes, and the IOU
score is calculated. Anchors, whose IOU score is greater than
0.7 are assigned with the positive label, and those with IOU
score less than 0.3 are assigned with the negative label. Out
of all anchor boxes, 128 positive and 128 negative labeled
anchor boxes are selected for further process.

In cases where few ground truth bounding boxes of an im-
age do not have any corresponding positive anchor box(i.e.,
Anchors with IOU>0.7), the IOU scores of all correspond-
ing anchor boxes are compared, and the one with maximum
IOU score is assigned with a positive label. In such scenarios,
radar point-based anchoring offers anchors with higher IOU

scores provided there is a radar point corresponding to those
ground truth objects. However, it is known that radar sensors
do not provide reﬂected points for all objects in the scene;
hence there are no anchors for them.

The Proposed Best of two method as outlined in Algo-
rithm 1 help in overcoming this limitation where all anchors
as per FFPN along with radar point-based anchors are uti-
lized in RPN target generation. The beneﬁts of this strategy
are; ﬁrst, objects which are not detected by using radar points
can now be detected by using RGB anchors similar to FFPN.
Second, this method increases the probability of having better
anchor candidates for the RPN. The effect of this method can
be seen in the performance comparison present in Table 1 and
2. We also want to highlight that the stated method causes a
negligible overhead at training time and no increment in in-
ference time.

4. DATASET

For training and evaluation, we used the NuScenes dataset
which is inspired by the KITTI dataset and covers a large va-
riety of outdoor conditions. To our knowledge, it is the only
publicly available dataset where radar data and camera images
are synchronized. For object detection, NuScenes provide 3D
bounding boxes with 23 classes.

Before using the NuScenes dataset, 3D bounding boxes
are converted into 2D and merged relevant classes to obtain
6 classes, which are Car, Truck, Person, Motorcycle, Bicycle,
and Bus. In the dataset, there are ground truth bounding box
annotations that are not visible in the image due to full occlu-
sion. Such cases are discarded by setting the visibility level
parameter from NuScenes as two. Also, the dataset is split
into 80:20% ratio for training and testing, respectively. To in-
vestigate the robustness of networks, extra noise is added to
evaluation images. Noise added are average blur noise with
kernel size three and additive Gaussian noise with 0.05 stan-
dard deviation. We also evaluated our networks on extreme

amount of noise. Because of page limitations all evaluation
and results are not presented here.

5. IMPLEMENTATION AND TRAINING

Faster R-CNN with feature pyramid network is our con-
ceptual base on which our proposed network is built. Ex-
periments are conducted on images of size 1024x1024 and
512x512. Scale used for anchor generation are (16, 32, 64,
128, 256) and (8, 16, 32, 64, 128) respectively. Maximum
number of objects per image is set to 100. Training is con-
ducted on one TITAN Pascal GPU with batch size of two.
First, base network FFPN is trained on COCO dataset [18]
with ResNet50 feature extractor. Then the trained weights
are used to initialize the weights of our proposed fused net-
works(RANet, BIRANet). These network are further trained
on the NuScenes training dataset. For training the network,
we use step-wise training with 0.001 learning rate.

6. RESULTS AND EVALUATION

For evaluation, COCO evaluation metric [18] is used with an
additional AP over 0.85 IOU for a more detailed evaluation.
FFPN generates anchors at each pixel of the image, whereas
RANet generates anchors only for locations corresponding to
which we get radar points. In the presented result Tables 1,
2, the performance of RANet lack by ∼5% in comparison to
that of FFPN, which is a reasonably good performance. Gen-
erally, we do not get radar points corresponding to each object
in the scene due to the limited ﬁeld of view, multiple surface
reﬂection, and others. So, it is reasonable to say that a net-
work trained on radar point-based network will not be able
to detect objects for which there is no corresponding radar

point. BIRANet took care of these missing objects, and pro-
vide better detection results in comparison to FFPN. Also, on
further observation, we ﬁnd many cases such as Fig 4, where
BIRANet detects objects which are not detected by FFPN.

On further noise addition, we see an expected decrease in
performance. However, the drop in performance of BIRANet
is less in comparison to that of FFPN. Both RANet and BI-
RANet show a minimal drop in performance, which proves
their robustness. Results presented in Table 2 over 512x512
size images, shows that proposed fusion networks are more
robust in low-resolution images. Hence, they can be efﬁcient
object detectors for vehicles with low-resolution cameras.

Based on the stated ﬁndings, we can say that radar data
help in making detection more robust towards noise and can
perform better. To our knowledge, RRPN is the only work
where RGB and radar sensor data of the NuScenes dataset
is used in the object detection task. In comparison, our net-
work’s performance is found to be better than theirs.

Proposed radar and RGB camera image fusion methods

are implemented on FFPN base network. We expect similar
behavior when proposed radar and RGB camera image fusion
is applied with state of the art object detection networks.
