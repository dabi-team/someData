Abstract. We present here the observations of solar jets observed on April 04, 2017 from
NOAA active region (AR) 12644 using high temporal and spatial resolution AIA instrument.
We have observed around twelve recurring jets during the whole day. Magnetic ﬂux emergence
and cancellation have been observed at the jet location. The multi-band observations evidenced
that these jets were triggered due to the magnetic reconnection at low coronal null–point.
Keywords. Sun: jets, Sun: magnetic reconnection, Sun:magnetic ﬁeld

1. Introduction

Solar jets are small scale eruptions in the solar atmosphere observed at diﬀerent wave-
lengths from ground as well as from space (Shibata et al., 1992, Schmieder et al., 2013,
Joshi et al., 2017). These can be originated from quite as well as in active regions. Several
attempts have been made to understand the dynamics, kinematics and their magnetic
topology. It is believed now that the magnetic reconnection between the closed and open
magnetic ﬁeld lines can be responsible for the origin of these phenomenon (Raouﬁ et al.,
2017). Magnetic ﬂux emergence and cancellation have been observed at the jet locations
(for example see. Chandra et al., 2017). Magnetic topology of jet locations suggested
that the null points, Quasi Sepratix Layers (QSL), bald patches etc can be found at jet
origin site (Mandrini et al., 1996). Numerical models have been proposed to shed light
in this phenomenon (Pariat et al., 2009, Moreno-Insertis et al., 2008). However it is de-
batable that what are the physical conditions on the solar surface, responsible for their
initiation. In this study, we present the multiwavelength study of recurrent jets observed
in NOAA active region (AR) 12644 on April 04, 2017. Section 2 presents observations
and dynamics of the jets. We summarize our results in section 3.
2. Observations and Results

For the present investigation, we have taken the data observed by Atmospheric Imag-
ing Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al., 2012) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO,
Pesnell, Thompson, & Chamberlin, 2012). The magnetic ﬁeld of the AR is explored by
Heliospheric Magnetic Imager (HMI, Schou et al., 2012) instrument.

NOAA AR 12644 (N13W91) was one of the highly jet productive region on April 04,
2017. It produced around twelve jets during the day in the north–west direction. Figure
1 (left) shows the location of AR in AIA 193 ˚A . The right panel of the Figure 1 is an
example of the evolution of one of the jets at 131 ˚A and 304 ˚A respectively. During the jets
we have observed both cool and the hot structure. The jet structures have reverse “Y” (or
Eiﬀel tower) type structure. Such Eiﬀel tower type morphology were also reported in the
earlier studies for example: Torok et al., 2009. The Eiﬀel tower type structures evidenced
the presence of magnetic null-point. The possible location of the null-point is shown by
the arrow in the ﬁrst image of right panel in ﬁgure 1. We have measured the height of
observed null-point and it is ∼ 7 Mm. We found the average speed, height, and lifetime
of the jets as 100 kms−1, 60 Mm, and 10 min respectively. For the magnetic causes of
current jets, we have look at the magnetic ﬁeld of the AR. The AR was at the west limb
on April 04, 2017, therefore it is diﬃcult to see its magnetic conﬁguration due to large

projection eﬀect. However, we track the evolution of the AR magnetic ﬁeld from April
01, 2017 onwards. Figure 2 shows the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld of AR. We found the
emergence of positive and negative ﬂux at the jet location. Later on this, newly emerged
positive ﬂux cancelled the existing negative ﬂux, which conﬁrms the reported ﬁndings
that both the ﬂux emergence and cancellation are responsible for the triggering of jets.
3. Summary

We have reported here the preliminary results of twelve solar jets from NOAA AR
12644 on April 04, 2017. All the jets were clearly visible in all EUV channels which shows
their multi–thermal nature. The morphology of them indicate the presence of null–point
type structure. Magnetic ﬁeld evolution of the AR shows the magnetic ﬂux emergence
and cancellation. We believe that the presence of null–point and the magnetic emergence
as well as cancellation at the jet’s locations could be responsible for the production of
these jets. In future, we plan to analyse them in more detail.
