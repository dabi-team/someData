Abstract 

Northwest Africa (NWA) 11042 is a heavily shocked achondrite with medium-grained 

cumulate textures. Its olivine and pyroxene compositions, oxygen isotopic composition, and 

chromium isotopic composition are consistent with L chondrites.  Sm-Nd dating of its primary 

phases shows a crystallization age of 4100±160 Ma.  Ar-Ar dating of its shocked mineral 

maskelynite reveals an age of 484.0±1.5 Ma.  This age coincides roughly with the breakup event 

of the L chondrite parent body evident in the shock ages of many L chondrites and the terrestrial 

record of fossil L chondritic chromite.  NWA 11042 shows large depletions in siderophile 

elements (<0.01×CI) suggestive of a complex igneous history involving extraction of a Fe-Ni-S 

liquid on the L chondrite parent body.  Due to its relatively young crystallization age, the heat 

source for such an igneous process is most likely impact.  Because its mineralogy, petrology, and 

O isotopes are similar to the ungrouped achondrite NWA 4284 (this work), the two meteorites 

are likely paired and derived from the same parent body.

1.0 Introduction 

NWA 11042 is a meteorite that was initially characterized as a primitive achondrite due 

to its igneous texture and affinity to L chondrites.  Primitive achondrites are texturally 

nonchondritic meteorites that bear affinities such as similar bulk mineralogy, chemical 

composition, or isotopic systematics, to chondritic precursors (Weisberg et al. 2006).  A great 

deal of diversity exists within primitive achondrites, and no single characteristic defines the 

group.  Some are thought to represent melts, partial melts, or melt residues from planetary bodies 

that underwent localized heating events such as early-stage partial differentiation or impact 

(Weisberg et al. 2006).  These include grouped meteorites such as the acapulcoites, brachinites, 

lodranites, ureilites, winonaites, and the silicates in IAB-IIICD iron meteorites (Mittlefehldt et al. 

1998).  All of these groups plot either on or below the terrestrial fractionation line in triple 
oxygen isotope space, i.e. they have close to zero or negative Δ17O values (Clayton and Mayeda 

1996; Greenwood et al. 2017).  In contrast to differentiated achondrites such as the SNC 

(shergottite-nakhlite-chassignites) or HED (howardite-eucrite-diogenite) groups, which are 

thought to have originated from Mars and 4 Vesta respectively (McSween 1985, 1994; Ruzicka 

et al. 1997; Treiman et al. 2000), the natures of the primitive achondrites’ parent bodies remain 

controversial (e.g. Benedix et al. 2005; Warren 2011; Gardner-Vandy et al. 2013; Keil 2014; 

Dhaliwal et al. 2017; Goodrich et al. 2017; Greenwood et al. 2017; Keil and McCoy 2018).  

Because of their chemical affinity to chondritic material (Weisberg et al. 2006), they are thought 

to represent intermediate rocks within the evolutionary trend between primitive chondrites and 

fully differentiated achondrites. 

While the internal heating of chondritic parent bodies by radioactive decay is generally 

thought to form primitive achondrites, impact heating and melting can also produce the igneous 

textures found in some achondrites.  The partial to wholesale melting produced by impact is 

capable of erasing any previously chondritic texture just as completely as heating by radioactive 

decay.  Additionally, large impacts on chondritic parent bodies sometimes produce melt pools 

extensive enough to differentiate the metal and silicate portions of initially chondritic material 

(Mittlefehldt and Lindstrom 2001; Benedix et al. 2008; Wu and Hsu 2019).  In this study, we 

present the mineralogy and petrology, oxygen and chromium isotopic composition, major and 
trace element geochemistry, noble gas composition, and geochronology using 147Sm/143Nd and 

40Ar/39Ar for NWA 11042.  We also compare its petrology with that of the primitive achondrite 

2 

 
 
 
NWA 4284 and its geochemistry with that of the L-impact melt PAT 91501 (Benedix et al. 

2008).  Our results suggest that this newly discovered meteorite formed through impact melting 

rather than primary differentiation of the L chondrite parent body. 

2.0 Samples and Methods 

NWA 11042 was purchased in Morocco by Abdelhadi Aithiba in 2016, and a deposit 

sample resides at the University of New Mexico.  Two small pieces were chipped off the main 

mass (90.1 g), mounted in epoxy, and polished to 0.05 µm smoothness.  Two thin sections were 

also produced from additional sawed pieces.  The thin sections were used for optical and electron 

microscopy, and the epoxy sections were analyzed using laser ablation inductively-coupled 

plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).  Eight acid-washed fragments were measured for their 

oxygen isotopic composition.  A chip of 1.5 g was crushed in a mortar and pestle and sieved to 

separate 500 µm, 250 µm, 150 µm, and ≤90 µm sized mineral grains.  The ≤90 µm portion was 

ground into powder as it likely represented close to the bulk composition of the meteorite.  The 

other portions were immersed in water and sonicated with a Fisher Sonic Dismembrator Model 

300 to remove any impurities from individual grains.  These grains were then magnetically 

separated, and then olivine, pyroxene, maskelynite, and melt pocket groups were hand-picked.  

Large mineral grains were selected by hand, while grain aggregates were further ground and 

sonicated in order to recover individual minerals.  Care was taken to avoid any weathered 

material, which is minimal as the fusion crust is intact and metal grains appear unaltered.  The 

olivine, pyroxene, melt pocket, and whole rock groups were used for Sm-Nd radiometric dating.  

Some of the maskelynite and whole rock samples were analyzed for their noble gas composition, 

including Ar-Ar dating. 

  A thin section of NWA 4284 on loan from Cascadia Meteorite Laboratory was also 

analyzed by electron microprobe for this study.  A thick section of PAT 91501, on loan from the 

National Meteorite Collection at the Smithsonian Institution, was also analyzed by LA-ICP-MS. 

2.1 Oxygen Isotope Analysis 

Eight fresh fragments of interior materials of NWA 11042 weighing between 1-2 mg 

were selected under a stereomicroscope to avoid any possible contamination from fusion crust.  

Oxygen isotopic analyses were performed using a CO2 laser + BrF5 fluorination system 

3 

 
 
 
following modified procedures outlined in Sharp (1990).  Oxygen isotope compositions were 

calculated using the following procedure: 

The δ17,18O values refer to the per mil deviation of a sample’s (17O/16O) and (18O/16O) 

ratios from the V-SMOW standard values, respectively, expressed as δ17,18O = 

[(17,18O/16O)sample/(17,18O/16O)V-SMOW -1]*103. The delta values were then converted to logarithmic 
δʹ in which δ17,18Oʹ = ln(δ17,18O/1000 + 1)*1000. The ∆17Oʹ values were obtained from the δʹ 

values following ∆17O’ = δ17Oʹ- 0.528 * δ18Oʹ. Typical analytical precision of the laser-
fluorination technique is better than ± 0.02‰ for ∆17Oʹ. 

2.2 Cr Isotope Measurements 

Chromium isotopic measurements were made on a small fusion crust-free chip of NWA 

11042. A homogenized powder was generated from the aliquot after crushing in an agate mortar 

and pestle. A 17.68 mg aliquot of the homogenized powder was placed into a PTFE capsule 

along with a 3:1 mixture of HF:HNO3 and sealed in a Parr pressure vessel stainless steel jacket. 

The sample was heated in an oven at 190° C for 96 h. After complete dissolution, including any 

refractory phases such as chromite, the sample solution was dried down and re-dissolved in 6 N 

HCl for separation of Cr through column chromatography. Chromium separation followed the 

previously described methods of Yamakawa et al. (2009). The isotopic composition of the 

purified Cr fraction was measured using a Thermo Triton Plus thermal ionization mass 

spectrometer at the University of California-Davis. Mass spectrometry and mass fractionation 

correction procedures followed those described in Sanborn et al. (2019). All isotope ratios are 

expressed as parts per 10,000 deviation (ε-notation) from the measured NIST SRM 979 Cr 

standard. 

2.3 Electron and X-Ray Microanalysis 

The thin sections and polished mounts were analyzed by electron probe microanalysis 

(EPMA) using a JEOL 8200 SuperProbe at UNM.  Analytical techniques included qualitative 

energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and quantitative wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy 

(WDS), including WDS mapping.  An accelerating voltage of 15 kV, a beam current of 20 nA, 

and a spot size of 1 µm were used for analyses.  Currents were reduced to 10 nA and spot sizes 

were increased to 10 µm for phases that included volatile elements.  Standards for WDS analysis 

4 

 
 
 
 
were manufactured by the C.M. Taylor Standard Corporation in Sunnyvale, CA.  EDS maps 

were also created using an FEI Quanta 3D field-emission gun (FEG) scanning electron 

microscope (SEM).  Certain areas of these sections and a whole rock powder were scanned using 

a Rigaku D/Max Rapid II X-ray diffractometer with a Cu tube Kα source.   

2.4 LA-ICP-MS Measurements 

Laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) measurements were performed on epoxy-mounted 

sections using an Electro Scientific Instruments New Wave™ UP193FX excimer laser ablation 

system coupled to a Thermo Element XR™ at the Plasma Analytical Facility, Florida State 

University. Analytical methods employed followed Yang et al. (2015) and Oulton et al. (2016). 

Mineral grains were analyzed with laser spot sizes of 50 or 100 microns, with a repetition rate of 

50 Hz and a dwell time of 10 seconds of ablation.  The bulk composition was determined by 

rastering the laser over an area of 8.6 mm2 using a 150 µm spot size scanned at 25 µm/s with a 

repetition rate of 50 Hz (about 60 µm depth).  Peaks analyzed, interference corrections, and 

standardization followed Yang et al. (2015, 2018).  Major elements were determined on the same 

spots using methods described in Humayun et al. (2010).  The USGS glasses BHVO-2g, BCR-2g 

and BIR-1g, NIST SRM 610, NIST 1263 a steel, and the iron meteorites North Chile (Filomena) 

and Hoba were used as standards to calibrate the abundances of about 60 elements (Yang et al. 

2018). Detection limits were determined from the 3-sigma standard deviation of the blanks taken 

with the laser off. Peaks not detected are shown as n.d.  Precision of LA-ICP-MS analyses for 

major elements on spots is in the 2-5% range (Humayun et al. 2010), and for trace elements it 

varies as a function of the concentration from 2-10%, except for elements near the detection limit 

(Yang et al. 2018). 

2.5 Sm-Nd Dating 

147Sm/143Nd analyses were conducted at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences 

at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, NM.  The olivine, pyroxene, chromite/melt 

pocket, and whole rock mineral separates were ground into fine powders and dissolved in Teflon 

bombs with HF and HNO3 for 72 hours, along with a blank sample.  The solutions were 

transferred to 30 mL Teflon beakers and merged with a Nd/Sm mixed spike.  This mixture was 

dried down and redissolved using 15N HNO3 until a brown crust was obtained.  The brown crust 

5 

 
 
 
was totally dissolved in several steps with 6N HCl, 2N HCl, 1N HCl, and finally 1N HNO3, to 

equilibrate the spike and the sample and prepare the solution for loading into the first set of 

columns.  These solutions were then run through two sets of 0.2 mL columns to separate out the 

Sr using Eichrom Sr spec resin and rare earth elements (REE) using Eichrom TruSpec resin.  The 

REE solutions were dried, dissolved in 0.18N HCl, and run through 10 mL Eichrom Ln resin 

columns to separate the Sm and Nd.  The Nd and Sm isotopic compositions of these cuts were 

measured using a Thermo Neptune™ multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass 

spectrometer.  The La Jolla Nd standard and a spiked Sm elemental standard were measured with 

the sample runs.  Data were reduced using an in-house spreadsheet.  Sm-Nd isochron age and 

plot were generated using IsoPlot (Ludwig 2008). 

2.6 Noble Gas Measurements 

Two bulk samples, a small and a large one, referred to as NWA 11042 “S” and “L”, 

respectively (~20 and ~100 mg, Table 3), and three grains of maskelynite (~100 μg each, Table 

3) were analyzed for their noble gas compositions at ETH Zürich to constrain exposure and 

radiogenic gas retention history and to trace potentially present trapped noble gases. 

For the bulk measurements, fragments of NWA 11042 were wrapped into Al foil and 

subsequently heated to 110°C for seven days in vacuum to reduce terrestrial atmospheric 

contamination.  The gas was extracted in one step by fusion in a Mo-crucible heated by electron 

bombardment to ~1700°C.  Gas-free re-extractions at ~1750°C demonstrated complete 

extraction.  The gases were separated into three fractions (He and Ne; Ar; Kr and Xe) and 

analyzed for all stable isotopes with a custom-built sector-field mass spectrometer equipped with 

a Baur-Signer ion source (Baur 1980), an electron multiplier operating in counting mode, and a 
Faraday cup for large gas amounts exceeding 1x10-9 cm3 STP (Riebe et al. 2017a).  Blanks were 

Al foil measured with the same procedure as the samples and amounted typically to 900, 150, 40, 
1, and <1 (in 10-12 cm3 STP) for 4He, 20Ne, 36Ar, 84Kr, and 132Xe, respectively.  Blank corrections 

were <1.5% for all He and Ne isotopes.  Ar, Kr, and Xe blank corrections were more significant: 
up to 4/20% for all Ar isotopes, ~20/40 % for 84Kr, and ~15/45 % for 132Xe in the large/small 

sample, respectively. 

Initially unaware of the details of NWA 11042’s parent body history, we analyzed 

maskelynite grains (“Mask1-3”) in addition to bulk material. ince The probability to trace noble 

6 

 
 
 
gases trapped from a potentially present atmosphere that could have been maintained if the 

parent body were sufficiently large is higher in quickly cooled glass. We used another in-house-

built, high-sensitivity mass spectrometer that enables a precise measurement of He and Ne in 

small samples.  An integrated molecular drag pump concentrates the noble gases into an ion 

source which increases the sensitivity by about two orders of magnitude compared to 

conventional mass spectrometers (Baur 1999).  To release the gases (preheated in the storage 

volume to 110°C for five days), each grain was heated individually by a Nd:YAG infrared laser 

(λ = 1064 nm) until melting (detailed procedure in Riebe et al. 2017b).  Re-extractions were 

performed at slightly increased laser power to ensure full gas extraction and, if significant (only 

for Mask1), added to the main extraction step.  Blank analyses  (obtained by laser heating of an 

area on the Al sample holder without any nearby sample yielded <1% of the sample signals and 

were hence negligible for all He and Ne isotopes. 

The measured noble gases were resolved into cosmogenic (cos), radiogenic (rad), and 

trapped (tr) components.  Adopting that 3He is entirely cosmogenic, (4He/3He)cos ~5.65 (Wieler 

2002), and 4Hetr is negligible, we obtain ~25 % of the 4He in the bulk samples is radiogenic.  In 
the maskelynite grains we observe larger variations from 25-80% 4Herad. Neon in the bulk 

samples is also essentially purely cosmogenic (20Ne/22Ne = 0.840-0.848 and 21Ne/22Ne = 0.895-
0.908). In contrast, the maskelynite grains contain small amounts of 20Netr (20Ne/22Ne = 1.018-

1.302, which is, however, too close to the endmember Necos to resolve Netr).  We assume Netr to 
be air.  The 36Ar/38Ar ratios (available only for the bulk samples) are slightly higher than the 

typical cosmogenic ratio, ~0.65 (Wieler 2002), which indicates a small amount of Artr.  We 
performed a two-component deconvolution between (36Ar/38Ar)cos of ~0.56-0.62, derived with 

the bulk chemical composition of NWA 11042 and a model for ordinary chondrite composition 
(Leya and Masarik 2009), and (36Ar/38Ar)tr of 5.31-5.36 (covering air and Q composition) to 

determine 38Arcos.  40Ar is likely entirely radiogenic, as the measured 40Ar/36Ar ratios and 40Ar 
concentrations are very similar, which would be very fortuitous if 40Ar from air would have been 

added to the fragments of very different masses. However, since we cannot fully exclude a 
contribution of atmospheric 40Ar the Ar retention ages obtained with the K-Ar method represent 

upper limits. 

The production rates (Table 6) for cosmogenic 3He, 21Ne, and 38Ar used for the 

calculation of the cosmic ray exposure (CRE) ages are based on 22Ne/21Ne as a shielding 

7 

 
indicator, the bulk chemical composition of NWA 11042 (Table 1), and the model for ordinary 

chondrite composition of the meteoroid (Leya and Masarik 2009). The uncertainty derived from 

the model is not included in the results but assumed to be 15-20%. In addition to this most 

reliable method to obtain precise CRE ages, we determined Kr-CRE ages for comparison with a 

model for ordinary chondrites (Eugster 1988). NWA 11042 shows Rb, Sr, Y, and Zr 

concentrations (Table 1), the most important target elements for the production of Kr, that are 

very similar to those found in L chondrites (Lodders and Fegley 1998). Hence, we preferred this 

approach to a model for production rates in achondrites (Eugster and Michel 1995).  In Eugster 

(1988), production rates for chondrites are given as a function of the shielding-dependent 
(22Ne/21Ne)cos ratio and the chemical composition of the different chondrites (here we assume L-

chondritic composition). The error of the production rate is estimated to be <20% (Eugster 

1988). The concentrations in NWA 11042 of the target elements Ba and La for the production of 

Xe deviate from typical L chondrite composition, as ~16.4 ppm Ba is high compared to average 

Ba of 4.1 ppm in L chondrites (Lodders and Fegley 1998).  However, this enrichment of Ba is 

likely related to terrestrial weathering.  Hence, we applied the same approach as for Kr to 

determine the Xe CRE age. The uncertainty for the production rate is estimated to be 5% (1σ) 

(Eugster 1988).  Nominal gas retention ages were determined for the U, Th-He, and K-Ar 
chronometers using radiogenic 4He and 40Ar (Table 3 and 4, respectively) and concentrations of 

U, Th, and K from Table 1.  Argon retention ages obtained with the 40Ar-39Ar technique are 

generally much more precise, hence, the additional age determination for conventional K-Ar 

rather allows a consistency check instead of delivering a high-quality value. 

2.7 40Ar/39Ar Dating 

Fragments of whole rock and a maskelynite mineral separate were analyzed by the 

40Ar/39Ar incremental heating method. The samples were irradiated at the TRIGA reactor in 

Denver, Colorado for 12 hours in the NM-290 package along with Fish Canyon Sanidine 

interlaboratory standard FC-2 with an assigned age of 28.201 Ma (Kuiper et al. 2008). Ages are 

calculated with a total 40K decay constant of 5.463×10-10 a-1 (Min et al. 2000).  40Ar/39Ar 

analyses were conducted at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology, New Mexico Institute of 

Mining and Technology in Socorro, NM. 

8 

 
 
 
After irradiation (without Cd shielding), the NWA 11042 samples were evacuated in an 

all metal argon extraction line and baked for 4 hours at 150°C. The samples were step-heated 

using an 810 nm diode laser, and each step consisted of 40 seconds of heating and 60 seconds of 

gas cleanup. Each extracted gas step was cleaned with a SAES GP 50 getter operated at 1.6 A 

and exposed to a cold-finger set at -125°C. Following gettering the gas was analyzed for argon 

isotopes using a Thermoscientific Helix MC-plus mass spectrometer operated in static mode. 

The collector configuration had 40Ar, 39Ar, 38Ar, 37Ar and 36Ar on the H2, H1, AX, L1 and CDD 
detectors, respectively. All Faraday detectors are equipped with 1x1012 Ohm resistors and the 

CDD is an ion counting detector with a dead time of 20 ns.  All data acquisition was 

accomplished with NM Tech Pychron software, and data reduction used Mass Spec (v. 7.875) 

written by Al Deino at the Berkeley Geochronology Laboratory.  Extraction line blank plus mass 

spectrometer background values are averages of numerous measurements interspersed with the 

unknown measurements. These values are 6.0±0.6, 1.00±0.12, 0.1±0.1, 0.10±0.05, 
0.1500±0.0075, x 10-17 moles from masses 40, 39, 38, 37, and 36, respectively.  Plateau ages 

represent the inverse variance weighted mean of the selected steps, the integrated age is the 

summation of all steps, and the error is calculated by quadratically combining the individual 

errors.  The plateau is defined by contiguous heating steps that overlap at the 2σ confidence 

level.  Errors are reported at 2σ. Other than blank 40Ar and reactor derived 40Ar from the 

irradiation of 40K all 40Ar is assumed to be radiogenic (that is the trapped initial 40Ar/36Ar is 

zero). 

3.0 Results 

3.1 Mineralogy and Petrology 

NWA 11042 is a rock that exhibits cumulate textures (Fig. 1). Its mineralogy consists of 

~400-800 µm subhedral grains of olivine (34.5 vol%), ~300-600 µm grains of anhedral 

orthopyroxene (36.2%) and augite (10.2 vol%), smaller grains of maskelynite (16.9%), chromite 

(1.2 vol%), troilite (0.4 vol%), and FeNi metal (0.7 vol%).  The FeNi metal is mostly kamacite 

with small amounts of taenite.  Trace amounts of apatite were also identified.  The olivine is 

uniform in composition without any signs of magmatic zoning (Fo75.4±0.2, n=20).  The pyroxene 

is bimodal and comprised of orthopyroxene (Fs20.2±0.4 Wo4.0±0.4, n=29) and augite (Fs10.5±0.5 

Wo38.5±0.1.5, n=17).  Any plagioclase that the rock might have had has been shocked to glassy 

9 

 
 
 
albitic maskelynite (Ab83.4±1.7 An11.9±1.8 Or4.8±0.4, n=10) which is surrounded by radiating fractures 

projecting into surrounding olivine or pyroxene grains.  Chromite grains (wt.% Al2O3=5.0±3.3, 

Cr2O3=56.4±1.7, Mg=3.0±0.4, Mn=0.79±0.3, Fe=29.1±1.2, TiO2=2.1±0.8, n=13) are similar in 

composition to those of ordinary chondrites in general (Johnson and Prinz 1991).  All FeNi metal 

is found paired with the troilite.  The calculated 2-pyroxene equilibrium temperature  is 1111 ± 

38 °C (Putirka 2008). 

NWA 11042 contains large (~500-5000 µm) shock-melt pockets scattered throughout the 

groundmass.  These are heterogeneously distributed, but melt fraction is estimated to be 10-15% 

cross-sectionally.  The largest pockets contain high-pressure phases such as ringwoodite, 

identified optically as large blue grains (Fig. 2) and confirmed using X-ray diffraction (Fig. A1).  

Some of the olivines around the pocket appear to have been stained brown due to shock-induced 

strain such as in the chassignite NWA 2737 (Bläß et al. 2010).  Other olivines show undulatory 

extinction under cross-polarized light (XPL).  EDS identification suggests that the shock-melt 

pockets contain relict partially melted major phases such as olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase, in 

addition to mesostasis.  Melted areas are enriched in free metal and sulfide relative to the 

groundmass.  Shock veins are also present in the sample, but the pockets are much more 

prevalent.  In backscattered electron (BSE) images, the melt pockets have dark (low Z) rims 

which show exsolving metal particles (Fig. 3). 

NWA 11042 is mineralogically and petrologically similar to ungrouped achondrite NWA 

4284 (Fig. 4), which contains the same phases in different modal abundance: olivine (34.1 vol%, 

Fo75.2±0.8, n=12), orthopyroxene (36.6 vol%, Fs20.5±0.1 Wo3.2±0.5, n=13), augite (6.0 vol%, Fs9.5±0.0 

Wo40.9±0.2, n=2), plagioclase (21.5 vol%, Ab82.0±2.1 An12.0±1.6 Or6.0±1.7), chromite (1.3 vol%), and 

troilite/kamacite (0.4 vol%).  NWA 4284, unlike NWA 11042, does not contain shock-melt 

pockets, and the plagioclase it contains has only partially been transformed to maskelynite.  The 

olivine and pyroxene compositions in both meteorites are largely similar to those of L chondrites 

(McSween et al. 1991). 

3.2 Trace Element Geochemistry 

Major and trace element concentrations determined by LA-ICP-MS for NWA 11042 are 

shown in Table 1.  Similar data gathered for PAT 91501 is shown in Table 2.  The bulk rock 

REE patterns of NWA 11042 and PAT 91501 are almost completely flat and ~2× CI chondritic 

10 

 
 
 
 
 
(Fig. 5-6).  The plagioclase and maskelynite show positive Eu anomalies, while the pyroxenes 

show complementary negative Eu anomalies.  This is characteristic of a somewhat reducing 

magmatic environment in which some of the Eu was incorporated into the plagioclase in a 

divalent state.  The melt pockets show smaller positive Eu anomalies, indicating plagioclase 

input.  They also contain lower concentrations of REE than the bulk rock, and as such appear to 

have undersampled augite.  The REE pattern of PAT 91501 (Fig. 6) is largely similar to that of 

NWA 11042 but with a slight negative Eu anomaly in the bulk rock data. 

Siderophile element compositions for NWA 11042 are compared with bulk ordinary 

chondrite compositions in Fig. 7. The bulk composition of NWA 11042 exhibits large 

compatible siderophile element depletions relative to bulk ordinary chondrites. This is reflected 

in the lower modal abundances of metal and troilite found in the meteorite.  The pattern of 

siderophile element depletion is similar to that in the L-impact melt PAT 91501 (Fig. 7). 

3.3 Stable Isotopic Data 

NWA 11042 has a Δ17O value of +1.03‰ and plots in the domain of the L ordinary 

chondrites on a triple oxygen diagram (Fig 1).  The oxygen isotopic composition is resolved 

from both H and LL chondrites. The eight analyses form a trend whose slope falls in between the 

slope of the terrestrial fractionation line (TFL) and the carbonaceous chondrite anhydrous 

mineral (CCAM) line (Clayton and Mayeda 1999).  The oxygen isotopic composition of NWA 

11042 does not plot anywhere near that of any grouped achondrites, but its O isotopes are similar 

to ungrouped achondrites NWA 4284, 5297, and 6698 (Fig. 8) (Greenwood et al. 2017).  The Cr 
isotopic composition of NWA 11042 is ε53Cr = +0.22 ± 0.04 and ε54Cr = -0.29 ± 0.08. When 

plotted on a ε54Cr versus Δ17O diagram (Fig. 9), the values for NWA 11042 plot within the 

compositional field defined by ordinary chondrites. 

3.4 Sm-Nd Dating 

The ratios 147Sm/144Nd and 143Nd/144Nd of the olivine, pyroxene, melt pocket, and whole 

rock samples were plotted against each other to assess if the mineral phases form an isochron 

(Fig. 10) with the linear equation 143Nd/144Nd = 143Nd/144Nd0 + 147Sm/144Nd*(eλt – 1), where 
143Nd/144Nd0 is the initial value at time t, and λ is the decay constant of the alpha decay of 147Sm 

to 143Nd, 6.539 × 10-12 a-1.  The olivine, pyroxene, and whole rock points form a line with t = 

11 

 
 
 
 
4.10 ± 0.16 Ga.  Since the melt pockets plot below this line, they were likely partially reset at a 

much later time than the crystallization age of the rest of the rock. 

3.5 40Ar/39Ar Dating 

40Ar/39Ar dating of NWA 11042 whole-rock and maskelynite yield similar age spectra 
that plateau for the first ~80-90% of 39Ar released, followed by a slight increase in age for the 

final heating steps (Fig. 11). The maskelynite plateau age is 484.0 ± 1.5 Ma, while the whole-

rock produces a less precise plateau age of 478.5 ± 5.5 Ma (2σ) (Fig. 11).  The maskelynite data 

are more precise than the whole-rock data due to the higher amount of K (0.77 vs 0.07 wt% K2O) 

in the maskelynite. Since the maskelynite is the major carrier of K, the whole-rock is likely 

dominated by degassing of maskelynite and thus both plateau ages likely reflect the closure age 
of the maskelynite.  Isochron plots of the maskelynite steps, corrected for cosmogenic 36Ar (see 

section 3.6), are shown in the appendix (Fig. A2).  The slopes of these plots show ages of 481.5 

± 1.6 Ma and 482.4 ± 1.7 Ma, and the similarities between these and the plateau ages suggest 

minimal non-radiogenic Ar components within the maskelynite.  As noted in the methods 
section, these ages are based on the assumption of a trapped 40Ar/36Ar value of zero and thus 

represent the maximum age of NWA 11042.  For instance, if we used a trapped value of 10 and 

20 to simulate potential atmospheric Ar contamination, the maskelynite age is reduced from 484 

Ma to 477 and 468 Ma, respectively.  Incorporating these 40Ar/36Ar values imparts significant 

internal discordance to the age spectrum and therefore we suggest that it is unlikely there is 

significant contamination with modern atmosphere and that the age of 484.0 ± 1.5 Ma is 

accurate. 

3.6 Noble Gas Measurements 

3.6.1 Concentrations and Isotopic Compositions 

He and Ne concentrations and isotopic compositions for bulk samples and maskelynite 

grains are given in Table 3. The results are mostly consistent within uncertainties for the two 

bulk samples. Larger variations can be observed compared to and amongst the concentrations 

and isotopic compositions of the maskelynite samples. Their 21Ne/22Ne ratios are slightly lower 

(indicating slightly larger relative contributions of trapped components) than for the bulk 

samples but still within the range of typical cosmogenic values (Wieler 2002). However, the 

12 

 
 
 
 
20Ne/22Ne ratios of the maskelynite grains indicate small amounts of 20Netr, with the highest 

amounts observed in Mask1. Consequently, even though the amounts are too low to resolve the 

trapped component, the maskelynites show trapped Ne which is not present in the bulk material. 

Since maskelynite forms by shock-induced melting and quenching of plagioclase (Chen and El 

Goresy 2000; Tomioka and Miyahara 2017), it is possible that parent body noble gases were 

trapped during maskelynite formation and, due to rapid cooling of the melt, preserved as gas 

vesicles in the glassy material. Hence, it seems worthwhile to also analyze the maskelynite grains 

for the heavier noble gases Ar-Xe in order to provide evidence and potentially allow 

characterization of trapped noble gases in the parent body of NWA 11042. 

Concentrations of Ar-Xe are generally small in bulk NWA 11042, as this achondrite has 

been intensely degassed, which is rather typical for thermally processed achondrites. The 
elemental abundances of trapped Ar and Kr relative to Xe (36Ar/132Xe = 702 and 680, 84Kr/132Xe 

= 2.97 and 6.19, for NWA 11042 L and S, respectively) represent an Ar-rich or subsolar phase 

(Crabb and Anders 1982; Busemann and Eugster 2002) mixed with minor amounts of Q and air.  

Kr isotopic ratios indicate a significant relative amount of Krcos mixed with Krtr 

(consistent with Q and air; solar wind is excluded based on its lack of light solar noble gases). 

Both samples also show additional excesses of 80Kr (pronounced) and 82Kr (less well resolved, as 
the excess/trapped Kr ratio is much lower for 82Kr than for 80Kr). For the determination of 

83Krcos, we assumed 86Kr to be entirely trapped, (80-83Kr/86Kr)tr to cover both Q and air, and 
applied a typical (80/82Kr/83Kr)cos ratio for L-chondrites (Lavielle and Marti 1988) to determine 

(80Kr/82Kr)excess ratios. The ratio is 2.9 ± 1.8 for NWA 11042 L and, hence, in good agreement 

with the published value of 2.6 (Marti et al. 1966) that would result from (n, γ) reactions 

predominantly caused by neutrons in the energy interval of 30-300 eV. This shows that the 
excesses of 80Kr and 82Kr are likely neutron-induced from 79Br and 81Br, respectively. Since 

these comparably slow neutron energies require greater depths, the occurrence of neutron-

induced isotopes implies a sufficiently large size of the meteoroid with a radius most likely >30 

cm (Eberhardt et al. 1963). 

The ratios of the lighter Xe isotopes also suggest considerable amounts of Xecos relative 

to Xetr (Q and air). Furthermore, we observe a 129I-derived excess of 129Xe. The concentration of 
129Xe is remarkably similar in both samples although 129I is usually heterogeneously distributed 

in only a few carrier minerals in small samples. The same holds for 40Arrad for which the 

13 

 
concentration is also constant within NWA 11042 L and S. This could indicate the presence of 

large pockets of melt during the formation of NWA 11042, accompanied by degassing of the 

originally perhaps heterogeneously distributed carriers of 129I and homogenization of Xe (and 
40Arrad). 

3.6.2 Production Rates and Cosmic Ray Exposure Ages 

We determined production rates (Table 6) of cosmogenic 3He, 21Ne, and 38Ar for the bulk 
samples based on the cosmogenic shielding parameter given here as 21Ne/22Ne, marked with * in 

Table 3, and the bulk chemical composition of NWA 11042 determined in this work. The 

applied model (Leya and Masarik 2009) allows a large range of possible meteoroid sizes and 

sample depths. We considered pre-atmospheric meteoroid radii from 20 to 150 cm (a radius of 

150 cm corresponds already to a meteoroid of ~45 t). Larger meteoroid sizes with >150 cm 

radius can likely be excluded: Only a few shielding depths (one per given radius 200, 300 and 

500 cm, respectively, randomly distributed in large depths between 180 and 350 cm) would be 

possible, while for radii between 20 and 150 cm, the shielding conditions are in a consistent, 

restricted and -as expected- shallow range between 4 and 9 cm right below the surface of the 

meteoroid. The randomly distributed unrelated matches at large depths of a large meteoroid are 

very likely artifacts of less well-determined parameters in the model predictions for large 

shielding, low particle flux and very small cosmogenic production.  

The preferred range of CRE ages for the two bulk samples deduced from cosmogenic 

3He, 21Ne, and 38Ar concentrations are given in Table 7. The ranges are essentially identical, 
which suggests no preferential loss of 3He e.g. during close orbital approaches to the Sun. The 

overall preferred range of CRE ages for NWA 11042 is 30-46 Ma which does not include the 

uncertainty of the physical model predictions assumed to be ~15-20 %.  Comparisons with CRE 

ages from other L chondrites will work best if the same production rate systematics are used.  
The less-precisely determined CRE age deduced from 83Krcos and 126Xecos based on the 

production rate given by Eugster (1988) are ~44 and ~55 Ma, respectively.  Hence, they tend 

towards higher ages than the average value obtained from the lighter cosmogenic noble gases.  

This trend could indicate loss during meteoroid transfer in space affecting especially the lighter 

noble gases. However, the very consistent ages received from cosmogenic He, Ne, and Ar rather 

14 

 
 
argue against such an effect. We used the error-weighted mean of the concentrations in NWA 
11042 L and S for both 83Krcos and 126Xecos. 

The same method as for the bulk samples has been used to determine the production of 

cosmogenic He and Ne nuclides in the maskelynite samples. However, this turned out to be less 

straightforward. The model predicted (21Ne/22Ne)cos ratios of about 0.67 (standard deviation = 

0.05) based on the measured maskelynite chemistry (Table 1). This is not consistent with the 

ratios measured in the maskelynite samples (between 0.81 and 0.85 for Mask1-3). Hence, it was 

not possible to determine the production rates and cosmic ray exposure ages for the maskelynite. 

The model prediction of very low (21Ne/22Ne)cos ratios can be expected for maskelynite 

with its high Na content (here ~7 wt%). Such low ratios have already been measured in previous 

studies, e.g., for martian maskelynites (Schwenzer et al. 2007). Hence, the discrepancy between 

predicted and measured ratios suggests a deviation of the actual chemistry of Mask1-3 from pure 

maskelynite chemistry as given in Table 1. Reasons for this deviation could be an insufficient 

separation of the maskelynites used for noble gas analysis. When we use a mixture of 

maskelynite with more dominant minerals of bulk chemistry (60-85 wt%) in the model, we 
actually obtain a number of possible (21Ne/22Ne)cos ratios that are consistent with the measured 

ratios. Images of the maskelynite-rich separates taken before noble gas analysis further 

strengthen this assumption: the visible contamination of the maskelynite grains with bulk 

material seems to increase in the order of Mask2 > Mask3 > Mask1, which is proportional to the 
measured (21Ne/22Ne)cos ratios. 

3.6.3 Radiogenic Gas Retention Ages 

The nominal gas retention ages for both bulk samples (Table 7) derived from radiogenic 

4He and bulk U and Th are in good agreement (T4, Table 3). The same holds for the retention 

ages received from 40Ar and bulk K (T40, Table 4). The T4 ages (average = 157 Ma) are 

generally much younger than the T40 ages (average upper limit for the K-Ar system 678 Ma and 

more reliably, ~484 Ma using the Ar-Ar data, see above) indicating further smaller heating 
event(s) after the reset of the 40K-40Ar chronology system. The T4 ages for the maskelynites vary 

between 89-648 Ma which may partly be ascribed to the application of the average concentration 

of U and Th for maskelynite in NWA 11042. The ages obtained from both K-Ar (assuming no 

40Ar air contamination) and Ar-Ar dating, are, at face value, not consistent. If we assume no air 

15 

 
 
contamination (our preferred option based on the very similar 40Ar in both samples, see above) in 
order to achieve a similar 40K-40Ar age as determined with the much more reliable 40Ar-39Ar 

method, about 870 ppm of K is required to produce the measured 40Arrad concentration, instead 

of the 581 ppm of K (Table 1) used here. 

4.0 Discussion 

The oxygen isotope composition of NWA 11042 suggests that it was derived from the L 

chondrite parent body.  The bulk REE pattern (Fig. 7) is roughly 2×CI chondritic and slightly 

elevated above that of ordinary chondrites (Nakamura 1974).  The compositions of the major 

phases, such as the Fo content of the olivine, the En content of the pyroxene, and the An content 

of the plagioclase, are also within the range of the L chondrites.  The Cr isotopic composition of 

NWA 11042 also plots within the field of the ordinary chondrites (Fig. 2).  These lines of 

evidence would put it in the category of the L-melt meteorites such as Chico and Patuxent Range 

(PAT) 91501, which crystallized from impact melted L chondrite material (Bogard et al. 1995; 

Mittlefehldt and Lindstrom 2001).  However, other lines of evidence obscure such a succinct 

classification.  NWA 11042 does not contain any relict chondrules within any of the areas 

studied.  L-melt rocks sometimes contain multiple lithologies, including unmelted chondritic 

material of metamorphic grade 3-6 along with melted areas (Bischoff et al. 2006).  Since NWA 

11042 is composed of a single igneous lithology, as evident from the thin section and hand 

sample, an impact-derived origin must have been energetic enough to initiate complete melting 

in the region this meteorite was formed.  The compositions of the major phases and textures of 

the unshocked portions of NWA 11042 resemble PAT 91501, which is also highly depleted in 

metal relative to the ordinary chondrites.  PAT 91501 was suggested to originate from a deep 

impact-melt sheet or dike on the L chondrite parent body  (Mittlefehldt and Lindstrom 2001; 

Benedix et al. 2008).   

The trace element composition of NWA 11042 is similar to other examples of impact 

melted L-chondrites.  Both NWA 11042 and the L impact melt PAT 91501 are depleted in 

siderophile elements (Fig. 9).  These include highly siderophile elements (HSE) such as Ir, Pt, 

and Au, which fractionate readily during partial melting and extraction of even a low-degree of 

Fe-Ni-S liquid, but also moderately siderophile elements such as P, Co, Ni, Ga, and Ge.  In 

particular, Ga/Al is depleted by a factor of ~2, and Ge/Si by a factor of ~100 relative to ordinary 

16 

 
 
 
chondrites.  These elements are more difficult to fractionate than HSE and their depletions are 

suggestive of moderate levels of partial melting enough to completely segregate the metal and 

silicate.  However, the flat REE pattern of NWA 11042 suggests that the silicate portion 

experienced minimal loss of silicate melt relative to ordinary chondrites.  Interestingly, the bulk 

REE pattern of PAT 91501 shows a slight negative Eu anomaly, implying that it lost some 

plagioclase by partial silicate melting. 

Some volatile lithophile elements are also depleted in NWA 11042 relative to ordinary 

chondrites (Fig. 12).  The K/Rb, K/La, and K/Th depletions indicate lower volatile contents than 

ordinary chondrites.  However, NWA 11042 is enriched relative to the ordinary chondrites in Tl, 

which is an even more volatile element than K (Lodders 2003).  While we cannot rule out that 

this might be due to weathering, it argues against simple devolatilization of the L chondrite 

parent body by impact melting. 

The whole rock Ar-Ar age of 478.5 ± 5.5 Ma and the maskelynite Ar-Ar age of 484.0 ± 

1.5 Ma fall within the range of many other Ar-Ar ages of shocked L chondritic material, which 

show a broad distribution peak between ~400 and 600 Ma (Bogard 2011; Swindle et al. 2014).  

These data suggest a large breakup event of the L chondrite parent body around this time, whose 

age has been refined to 470 ± 6 Ma by the separation of radiogenic Ar from various excess Ar 

components in several shocked L chondrites (Korochantseva et al. 2007).  Additional 

measurements of the shocked L6 chondrite NWA 091 yielded an age of 475.4 ± 5.9 Ma after 

removal of excess Ar components (Weirich et al. 2012).  Both of these studies used Cd shielding 

during irradiation of samples in order to resolve different components.  The meteorite Ar-Ar ages 

can be linked to the terrestrial stratigraphic record, which shows a spike in fossil meteoritic 

material bearing L chondritic signatures at 467.3 ± 1.6 Ma (Korochantseva et al. 2007; Heck et 

al. 2008; Schmitz 2013).  Lindskog et al. (2017) refined the age of the breakup event to 468.0 ± 

0.3 Ma using Pb-Pb dating of detrital zircons in a limestone bed with an age of 467.50 ± 0.28 Ma 

and the CRE ages of the fossil meteoritic chromites found in the bed.  Chromites found in these 

beds all have CRE ages under ~1.2 Ma (Heck et al. 2008; Schmitz 2013), and they are found to 

be progressively older proceeding up the stratigraphic section.  The oxygen isotopic composition 

of >99% of these grains is L-chondritic (Heck et al. 2016).  This suggests that they originated 

from a single impact event and transited rapidly from the asteroid belt to Earth-crossing orbits. 

17 

 
The Ar-Ar age of the maskelynite in NWA 11042 of 484.0 ± 1.5 Ma contributes an 

enigmatic data point to the narrative of L chondrite breakup event, previously established by Ar-

Ar dating.  While the stratigraphic record gives a precise age for a breakup event that delivered L 

chondritic material to Earth, the various Ar-Ar ages in the literature span a wide diversity of ages 

and uncertainties even within single lithologies (Fig. 13).  The works of Korochantseva et al. 

(2007) and Weirich et al. (2012) were major breakthroughs in pinning down a single age for the 

breakup event, but they notably relied on corrections for trapped Ar to achieve plateau ages.  By 

contrast, the Ar-Ar age of NWA 11042 contains minimal non-radiogenic Ar and thus does not 

require a trapped correction. Its plateau also converges on an age with a smaller error than any 

previously measured L chondritic material to our knowledge (Fig. 9).  The plateau represents 

92% of measured Ar, and as such it does not show any evidence for partial resetting or 

contamination.  Interestingly, the only meteorite of the five presented by Korochantseva et al. 

(2007) that had a clear plateau without requiring a trapped Ar correction was Mbale, whose age 

of 479 ± 7 Ma is within error of our measurement for NWA 11042. 

The high level of shock in NWA 11042, evident from the presence of ringwoodite in its 

melt pockets, is suggestive of a large impact event such as the breakup of the L chondrite parent 

body.  The shock event and its associated heating must have been transient enough to preserve 

ringwoodite within the shock melt pockets, suggesting that the Ar-Ar age is representative of the 

event itself and not a later cooling age.  Therefore, it is possible that the L chondrite parent body 

experienced a catastrophic impact event at 484.0 ± 1.5 Ma, and a large fragment was later 

disrupted causing an influx of material to Earth 15 Ma later.  Only the second event seems to be 

present in the terrestrial fossil record.  A fragment containing NWA 11042 would have then been 

disrupted much later, around 33 Ma ago, as evident from its exposure age, eventually bringing 

this meteorite to Earth.  However, it is also possible that the older age is due to analytical 

difficulties involving the 40K decay constant, as discussed below.  For the older age to be 

reflective of a second disruption event, the fragment containing NWA 11042 would have had to 

move away from the resonance that likely allowed the other fragment, involved in the 468 Ma 

disruption, to delivery material to Earth.  After this, NWA 11042 would have had to move back 

towards such a resonance after the 33 Ma event that dislodged it from the fragment.  Such a 

scenario is fairly complicated and must be weighed with other sources of inconsistency. 

18 

 
Although the analytical uncertainty of the maskelynite is reported at ±1.5 Ma, there are 

other important sources of uncertainty that require consideration when comparing variable 

geochronology data sets.  For 40Ar/39Ar dating, error in the age of dating standard Fish Canyon 
tuff sanidine and the 40K decay constant, as well as laboratory calibration issues, can be 

important.  Prominent work by Kuiper et al. (2008) and Renne et al. (2010, 2011) yield variable 

estimates of Fish Canyon age and decay constants as well as their associated uncertainties. 

However, because the age of the standard is balanced by the decay constant, there is no 

significant change in age between the two calibrations.  For instance, recalculating our reported 

age of 484.0 Ma based on Kuiper et al. (2008) to those of Renne et al. (2011) yields an age of 

484.7 Ma. The total decay constant error reported by Renne et al. (2011) is substantially smaller 

than the error reported by Min et al. (2000) that is embodied in the Kuiper et al. (2008) age of 

Fish Canyon sanidine. Approximately ±0.1 Ma additional error is imparted by the Renne et al. 

(2011) estimate of decay constant uncertainty, whereas this would be ~±1 Ma for the Min et al. 

(2000) value.  Finally, the NM Tech lab has not yet adopted the values of Renne et al. (2011) due 

to calibration issues between the lab and the Berkeley Geochronology Center.  Various published 

and unpublished datasets indicate about 0.1 Ma offset at the K-Pg boundary that likely stems 

from lab procedural differences (e.g. Niespolo et al. 2017).  If the offset is linearly extrapolated 

to 484 Ma, lab calibration errors would be about ±0.5 to 1 Ma. 

In summary, it is difficult to accurately quantify calibration and constant errors, but 

conservatively our analytical uncertainty at ±1.5 Ma could expand to about 3-4 Ma given the 

magnitude of the numbers reported above. Although it is intriguing to consider two separable 

impact events on the L chondrite parent, given multiple sources of uncertainty we cannot 

definitively conclude this at this time. 

The Sm-Nd age of NWA 11042 is less precise than the Ar-Ar age and reveals an ancient 

crystallization age completely different from the shock age (Fig. 10).  The shock-melt pockets 

that plot off the isochron have most likely been partially reset by the shock event that the Ar-Ar 

systematics dates.  Unfortunately, these partially reset components likely contaminated the rest 

of the mineral separates as well, as it would have been impossible to completely remove them 

during separation.  The whole rock portion, meanwhile, obviously contains these melted 

components.  The age of 4100 ± 160 Ma is thus only a minimum crystallization age for NWA 

11042, and the true age must be older. 

19 

 
The thermal history of the L chondrites and their parent body, revealed by Ar-Ar 

chronometry of meteorites, records a large number of impacts between 400 and 600 Ma, with 

few between then and 4300 Ma, and a large number of ages around 4400-4500 Ma (Swindle et 

al. 2014).  If the Sm-Nd age of NWA 11042 is taken to be “older than 4100 ± 160 Ma,” then it is 

possible that its formation resulted from a large impact on the L chondrite parent body during 

this early time in solar system history.  While the equilibrium temperature of 1111 ± 38 °C 

recorded by the pyroxenes in NWA 11042 is higher than the modelled maximum temperatures of 

impact-heated ordinary chondrite parent bodies by ~200 °C (Ciesla et al. 2013), its geochemical 

and petrological similarity to PAT 91501, determined to be an impact melt (Benedix et al. 2008), 

suggest that it could also be formed by impact melting. 

It has been observed that as the H chondrites increase in metamorphic grade, their 
radiogenic ages determined by Hf-W, phosphate 207Pb-206Pb, and phosphate fission track dating 

get increasingly younger (Trieloff et al. 2003; Kleine et al. 2008; Blackburn et al. 2017).  A 
similar trend in phosphate 207Pb-206Pb ages has been observed in the L chondrites as well 

(Blackburn et al. 2017).  The “onion-shell” model of ordinary chondrite parent bodies (Trieloff et 

al. 2003) suggests that the cause of this progressive decrease in age is that the U and Pb-bearing 

material in more highly metamorphosed chondrites took longer to reach closure temperature 

because they were deeper within their parent body and thus experienced a longer heating period.  

An alternative hypothesis to an impact melting origin is that NWA 11042, and potentially the 

ungrouped achondrite NWA 4284, could represent samples of material located even deeper 

within the “onion” which was partially melted and differentiated.  Partially melted material from 

this event has to this point not been identified in the meteorite collection, although interestingly 

the oxygen isotopes of silicate inclusions in the IVA iron meteorites also plot in the L chondrite 

field (Clayton and Mayeda 1996), and their chromium isotopes are similar to those of ordinary 

chondrites (Sanborn et al. 2018).  Other lines of evidence for primary melting of chondrite parent 

bodies include modelling results that suggest the possibility of planetesimal melting in the 

presence of insulating chondritic crusts (Elkins-Tanton et al. 2011; Weiss and Elkins-Tanton 

2013; Fu and Elkins-Tanton 2014), chronological evidence that suggests planetesimal melting 

and differentiation was concurrent with chondrule formation (Amelin 2008; Kleine et al. 2009; 

Schiller et al. 2011; Connelly et al. 2012; Srinivasan et al. 2018), and remanent magnetization 

20 

 
identified in ordinary chondrites suggesting they formed in the presence of a core dynamo (Shah 

et al. 2017). 

However, an undisturbed onion-shell model for ordinary chondrite parent bodies is 

inconsistent with varying metallographic cooling rates measured from diffusion profiles across 

FeNi metal grains in H and L chondrites (Taylor et al. 1987; Scott et al. 2014), which do not 

show a monotonic relationship with metamorphic grade.  Instead, early-formed parent bodies 

were likely disrupted by impacts prior to cooling below the temperature at which FeNi diffusion 

becomes negligible (~500 °C).  Importantly, this does not negate the radiochronometric evidence 

for an onion shell; it instead suggests that originally thermally stratified bodies were disrupted 

and reaccreted into “rubble piles” which preserved the radioisotopic imprint but reset the 

metallographic cooling history.  If NWA 11042 represents deep partial melting of an onion-shell 

parent body, then it must have melted before subsequent disruption. 

Wu and Hsu (2019) recently dated NWA 11042 using phosphate 207Pb-206Pb and found 

disturbed concordance with an upper intercept age of 4,479 ± 43 Ma and a lower intercept age of 

465 ± 47 Ma.  These ages concord with phosphate 207Pb-206Pb ages obtained from the L6 

chondrite Novato of 4,472 ± 31 Ma and 473 ± 38 Ma (Yin et al. 2014).  The younger ages, 

interpreted as shock resetting ages, agree well with our more precise Ar-Ar age of 484.0 ± 1.5 

Ma.  The older age of Wu and Hsu (2019), interpreted as the crystallization age, argues strongly 

against petrogenesis by partial differentiation of the L chondrite parent body, since any short-

lived radiogenic heat sources would have decayed away by that time.  Instead, Wu and Hsu 

(2019) suggest that NWA 11042 was formed inside a thick melt dike within a large impact 

structure which remained thermally insulated for long enough to generate the igneous properties 

observed in the meteorite. 

The petrologic characteristics of NWA 11042 and NWA 4284 (this work) suggest that 

their parent body experienced a low degree of partial melting, enough to extract an Fe-Ni-S 

liquid but not enough to mobilize low-degree silicate melts that would have preferentially 

extracted plagioclase.  This is consistent with the sub-liquidus temperature recorded by the 

pyroxene thermometer.  Plagioclase extraction would have also created a bulk composition 

depleted in light REE with a negative Eu anomaly.  Additionally, the Fe/Mn in the olivine and 

pyroxene in NWA 11042 and 4284, along with the Fo# in the two rocks and ordinary chondrites 

is virtually identical.  Were the two achondrites melt residues produced by fractional melting, a 

21 

 
trend in Fe/Mn with olivine Mg# would be expected (Sunshine et al. 2007).  Instead, a low 

degree of partial melt and extraction of an Fe-Ni-S liquid are likely responsible for the depletion 

of siderophile elements and the slight change in modal mineralogy observed between the two 

meteorites. 

Overall, the petrological, geochemical, and chronological evidence presented here and by 

Wu and Hsu (2019) suggest that NWA 11042 was originally formed by a deep impact melt vein 

or dike that imparted its igneous characteristics upon the L chondrite parent body.  Incidentally, 

while the asteroids 8 Flora and 6 Hebe are associated with the LL and H chondrites, respectively 

(Gaffey and Gilbert 1998; Vernazza et al. 2008), there is currently no large asteroid linked to the 

L chondrites.  It is therefore likely that this parent body was disrupted, and the shock ages of L 

chondritic material and terrestrial meteorite records attest to this.  While NWA 11042 likely 

represents an impact melt rock sourced from the L chondrite parent body, the possibility of 

primary igneous melting on ordinary chondrite parent bodies remains a possibility that cannot be 

ruled out based on current knowledge and available samples. 

Conclusions 

We have performed petrologic, geochemical, isotopic, and chronological analyses on 

NWA 11042, a cumulate rock with affinities to L chondrites.  These data were compared to the 

petrology of NWA 4284 and the geochemistry of PAT 91501.  Oxygen and Cr isotopes, along 

with bulk petrology and geochemistry suggest that NWA 11042 formed from the partial melting 

of the L chondrite parent body at least 4.10 ± 0.16 Ga ago, but likely earlier.  The 207Pb-206Pb 

crystallization age of 4,479 ± 43 Ma obtained by Wu and Hsu (2019) is likely more correct.  This 

partial melting event was likely caused by an impact large enough to form a deep insulating melt 

vein or dike that allowed slow cooling and the formation of a cumulate texture.  The removal of 

an Fe-Ni-S liquid caused heavy depletion of siderophile elements but left no evidence of 

fractional melting in the lithophile elements, similar to the L impact melt PAT 91501.  The Ar-

Ar chronometer was reset at 484.0 ± 1.5 Ma, implicating this meteorite with the breakup of the L 

chondrite parent body which is recorded in a spike of Ar-Ar ages of L chondritic material 

between 400 and 600 Ma and the terrestrial fossil record at ~468 Ma.  While the precision of this 

Ar-Ar age and that of the fossil chromite record could suggest the possibility of multiple large 

22 

 
 
 
impacts during the breakup, uncertainties within various geochronology parameters prevent a 

definitive conclusion of multiple events from being reached.

Table 3 showing concentrations of He and Ne isotopes and resolved components as well as 
isotopic compositions.  Concentrations in 10-8 cm3 STP g-1. Uncertainties on measured noble gas 
concentrations include ion counting statistics, uncertainties of sample mass and calibration gas 
amounts as well as variations in blank level and detector sensitivity. Uncertainties on isotopic 
ratios also include ion counting statistics and blank corrections, and instrumental mass 
discrimination. Uncertainties on cosmogenic and trapped concentrations include uncertainties 
related to the deconvolution when applied, i.e., the respective choice of cosmogenic and trapped 
endmember components and all experimental uncertainties. 4Herad uncertainties include 
uncertainties on 3Hecos concentrations and the typical (3He/4He)cos ratio (Wieler 2002). N.d. = not 
detected.  

a measured = cosmogenic concentration. 
* Higher precision for (21Ne/22Ne)cos in NWA 11042 S compared to NWA 11042 L due to measurement with the 
electron multiplier instead of the Faraday cup. Ratio used as shielding indicator to determine the production rates for 
both bulk samples.

Isotopic ratios corrected for blank, radioactive decay, and mass discrimination, not corrected for interfering reactions. 
Errors quoted for individual analyses include analytical error only, without interfering reaction or J uncertainties. 
Integrated age calculated by summing isotopic measurements of all steps. 
Integrated age error calculated by quadratically combining errors of isotopic measurements of all steps. 
Plateau age is inverse-variance-weighted mean of selected steps. 
Plateau age error is inverse-variance-weighted mean error (Taylor 1982) times root MSWD where MSWD>1. 

Plateau error is weighted error of Taylor (1982). 
Isotopic abundances after Steiger and Jäger (1977). 
x preceding sample ID denotes analyses excluded from plateau age calculations. 

   Weight percent K2O calculated from 39Ar signal, sample weight, and instrument sensitivity. 

Ages calculated relative to FC-2 Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine interlaboratory standard at  28.201 Ma (Kuiper et al. 2008). 

   Decay Constant (LambdaK (total)) =  5.463e-10/a (Min et al. 2000). 
   Correction factors: 

    (39Ar/37Ar)Ca = 0.00073 ± 0.000020
