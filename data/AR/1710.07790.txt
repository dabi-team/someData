The charge transfer reaction of Ar+ with H2 and D2 has been investigated in an experiment combining crossed beams
with three-dimensional velocity map imaging. Angle-differential cross sections for two collision energies have been
obtained for both neutral species. We ﬁnd that the product ions are highly internally excited. In the reaction with
H2 the spin-orbit excited Ar+ state’s coupling to the ’resonant’ vibrationally excited product H+
2 (v = 2) dominates
for both investigated energies, in line with previous investigations. The observed angular distributions, however, show
signiﬁcantly less back-scattering than was found previously. Furthermore, we discovered that the product ions are
highly rotationally excited. In the case of Ar+ reacting with D2 the energetically closest lying vibrational levels are
not strictly preferred and higher-lying vibrational levels are also populated. For both species the backward-scattered
products show higher internal excitation.

INTRODUCTION

Ion-molecule reactions play an important role in many
chemical environments such as interstellar molecular clouds
and planetary atmospheres1,2. Charge transfer processes in
particular were found to be of importance for the hydrogen
chemistry in the early universe3 and the X-ray emission of
comets4. To gain a mechanistic understanding of such reac-
tions both theoretical and experimental studies of the involved
dynamics are needed. To study charge transfer reaction dy-
namics we investigated one of the conceptually simplest sys-
tems: The reaction of Ar+(2PJ ) with H2 and its isotope D2.
Argon is the third-most abundant component of the earth’s at-
mosphere and is therefore an important reactant ion. Its reac-
tion with molecular hydrogen has been a focus of many exper-
imental and theoretical investigations over the last six decades
and is among the most studied ion-molecule reactions5–46:

It can proceed via proton transfer, also referred to as atomic
re-arrangement and indicated by equation (1), or via charge
transfer as shown in equation (2). The charge transfer com-
plex Ar-H+
2 acts as an intermediate conﬁguration for the pro-
ton transfer channel. The proton transfer and the charge
transfer channel are exoergic by 1.5 eV and 0.33 eV, respec-
tively. Ar+ possesses two spin-orbit states, Ar+(2P3/2) and
Ar+(2P1/2) that are separated by 178 meV. Equation (3) de-
scribes a collision induced change in the Ar+ spin-orbit state.

Early investigations of reaction (1) proposed a classical
Langevin-type capture model6,47,48. Later temperature depen-
dent studies revealed rates for reaction (1) smaller than the
Langevin model predicts and a weak positive energy depen-
dence over a large temperature range20,30. Spin-orbit state
selective ionization techniques revealed an enhanced reac-
tivity for spin-orbit excited Ar+ compared to the ground
state29,36,38,45. This enhancement is more pronounced for the
charge transfer than for the proton transfer channel. The pub-
lished ratios of the cross section of the spin-orbit excited com-
pared to the ground state are in the range of 5 to 13 at colli-
sion energies below 1.5 eV. For the proton transfer the ratios
are 1.3 to 1.5 in the same energy range38. At higher collision
energies this enhancement diminishes and approaches 0.8 to
1.0 for both channels above 5 eV.

The state-speciﬁc cross sections vary quite substantially for
the mentioned experimental studies. Tanaka et al. obtained a
cross section for the charge transfer of spin-orbit excited Ar+
of 2.7 ˚A2 at 0.48 eV collision energy compared to the 16.2 ˚A2
obtained by Liao et al. and 21.0 ˚A2 obtained by Henri et al. at
similar collision energies. It is interesting to note that the mea-
sured total cross sections for the combined reaction channels
(1) and (2) exceed the Langevin cross section for the reaction
of state selected Ar+(2P1/2) + H2 at low collision energies in
the experiments by Tanaka et al. and Liao et al. . Tanaka et al.
explain this by arguing that the proton transfer proceeds ﬁrst
via a long-range electron jump followed by a reaction of H+
2
with Argon. As Argon possesses a larger polarizability, the
resulting Langevin rate is larger and ﬁts as a limiting rate to
their experimental results29. The cross sections obtained by
Ervin and Armentrout34 as well as Tosi et al.41 for the proton
transfer channel with a statistical mixture of the two Ar+ spin-
orbit states are below the Langevin limit. The same is true for
the the results obtained by Hawley et al. for reactions with
state-selected ground state Ar+ at lower collision energies40.

In addition to state selective ionization Liao et al. used the
differential reactivity method to obtain the product ion vibra-

tional state distribution. They found a clear preference for
v = 2 in reaction (2) for reactions with spin-orbit excited
Ar+. The enhanced reactivity and preference for v = 2 in
the charge transfer reaction (2) has been explained by a quasi
resonance in energy. The energy of the educts Ar+(2P1/2) +
H2(X, v = 0) is very close to the energy of the vibrationally
excited products Ar(S0) + H+
2 (v = 2) (∆E = 16 meV). The
relevant energy levels are depicted in FIG. 1. This quasi-
resonance in energy gives rise to a seam in the asymptotic part
of the potential energy surfaces of the entrance and exit chan-
nel at intermolecular distances of approx. 4.4 to 5 ˚A39,41,45.
This seam represents an avoided crossing through which the
reaction of Ar+(2P1/2) can efﬁciently proceed to the vibra-
tionally excited product H+
2 (v = 2). The decreasing con-
tribution of this resonance effect at higher energies has been
explained by the opening of other reaction pathways medi-
ated by higher lying vibrational states.
In the conceptually
similar charge transfer reaction of Ar+ with N2 the cou-
pling to a vibrationally excited product state via an avoided
crossing has been theoretically predicted and experimentally
conﬁrmed38,49–51. The preference for the H+
2 (v = 2) prod-
uct is also evident in the reverse reaction as a signiﬁcantly
increased reaction rate if the H+
2 is in the v = 2 excited
state32,38,52,53. The Ar+ ground state (2P3/2) reacts slower
than the spin-orbit excited state and couples most efﬁciently to
H+
2 (v = 0) and (v = 1) at collision energies below 0.5 eV29.
In addition to reaction rate studies angle-differential cross
sections have been published by Hierl et al.26 They observed
forward scattering for all investigated collision energies and
an additional major backward contribution at a collision en-
ergy of 0.13 eV. The forward-scattered product ions were ob-
served close to the energy expected for the ’resonant’ vibra-
tional level of the H+
2 products. A number of theoretical inves-
tigations have been carried out on the charge transfer and pro-
ton transfer reaction pathways39,41,44–46,54. Baer et al.54 pub-
lished calculated reaction rates along with angle-differential

2

cross sections based on a ’reactive inﬁnite order sudden ap-
proximation (RIOSA)’ approach. They predict forward and
rainbow angle scattering for the charge transfer reaction. Re-
cently, a quantum wave-packet calculation has been carried
out by Hu et al. investigating the proton transfer channel of
the reverse reaction H+
2 + Ar55. To our knowledge no state-of-
the-art quantum scattering calculations have been published
for reactions (1) and (2) and none of the mentioned theoretical
work explicitly treated rotational excitation for these reaction
pathways.

The isotopic reaction of Ar+(2PJ ) + D2 has also been inves-
tigated in previous studies using various techniques29,34,40,43.
The quasi-resonance is not present in this system and stud-
ies have shown that the reaction rate of the excited spin-orbit
state for both reactions is only slightly enhanced compared to
reactions with ground state Ar+.

In this work we present angle- and energy-dependent differ-
ential cross sections of the charge transfer reaction obtained
with a crossed-beam velocity map imaging spectrometer. It
enables the detection of the full three-dimensional velocity
distribution of the product ions in a kinematically complete
way. From the observed velocities we extract the angular dis-
tribution of the reaction products and their excited rovibra-
tional quantum states after the reaction.

II. METHOD

The experimental setup has been described elsewhere in
more detail56 and only a brief description will be given here.
The experiment combines the crossed-beam technique with a
3D-velocity map imaging (VMI) spectrometer to study ion-
molecule reaction dynamics. It is operated at a repetition rate
of 20 Hz. The ions are produced either by electron impact in
a supersonic expansion of Argon or by igniting a plasma in
the expansion. Both techniques should produce a statistical
distribution of Ar+(2P1/2) to Ar+(2P3/2) of 1:2. The ions are
extracted, mass selected and guided into an octupole radio-
frequency ion trap.
Inside, through non-reactive collisions
with a buffer gas (usually Argon), the kinetic energy spread
of the ions is minimized and their spatial distribution conﬁned
using shaping electrodes. The ions are then extracted and
decelerated before entering the interaction region where they
cross a molecular beam, produced by a supersonic expansion,
under an angle of 60°. The molecular beam is produced by
a pulsed piezo-cantilever valve and skimmed before crossing
the ion-packet. The overlap region is located in the center of a
VMI electrode stack which is pulsed on to extract the product
ions perpendicular to the interaction plane. The velocity in the
scattering plane is mapped onto a position-sensitive detector
consisting of two multi-channel-plates and a phosphor screen.
The impact-position of the ions is detected by a CCD-camera.
Additionally, we record the ﬂight-time by measuring the ar-
rival of the photons emitted from the phosphor-screen with a
photo-multiplier-tube. The raw laboratory images are trans-
formed into a center-of-mass velocity distribution. Together
with the time-of-ﬂight information the full three-dimensional
velocity vector for each event can be extracted. The maximum

velocity is given by the available energy, namely the exother-
micity plus the collision energy, and is referred to as the kine-

matic cut off.
value, due to conservation of energy, we can attribute the dif-
ference to energy transfer into internal excitation of the molec-
ular products. Although we obtain the full three-dimensional
velocity distribution we usually represent them as a 2D dis-
tribution by projecting all ion velocity vectors into a plane
given by the velocity along the center-of-mass axis vx and a
radial velocity vr.
In this center-of-mass frame the neutral
beam travels to the left.

The velocity and energy spread of the reactant ion beam are
also obtained with the VMI technique. Typical values for the
energy spread (FWHM) of the Ar+ beam are in the order of
160-250 meV. In order to obtain the corresponding quantities
for the neutral beam, it is ionized by an electron gun prior
to detection with the VMI spectrometer. For the normal-H2
neutral beam the spread is around 40 meV corresponding to
a translational temperature of approx. 70 K. The obtained ve-
locity distributions are broadened by the energy spread of the
two reactant beams along with smearing caused by imperfect
imaging of the ions. We can estimate this broadening from
the experimental parameters obtained for the two beams and
simulation results of the VMI conditions57,58. Under the ex-
perimental conditions of the presented experiments the energy
spread of the beams dominates this broadening and amounts
to below 20 meV (FWHM) for forward-scattered ions at the
observed velocities.

III. RESULTS

The results of the charge transfer reaction of Ar+(2P3/2,1/2)
+ H2 are presented in FIG. 2 alongside the extracted inter-
nal energy distribution of the H+
2 products and the angular
distribution represented by -cos(θ) to be consistent with the
neutral beam direction for 0.1 eV and 0.28 eV collision en-
ergies. The outermost ring drawn into the velocity distribu-
tion corresponds to the kinematic cut off and the inner rings
represent the vibrational levels of the H+
2 products (see also
FIG. 1). The white rings correspond to the spin-orbit excited
Ar+(2P1/2) and the red rings to Ar+(2P3/2). The arrows mark
the mean velocity of the neutral and ion beam prior to collision
in the center-of-mass frame. In the second panel we present
the internal energy distribution along with an inset axis mark-
ing the vibrational levels of H+
2 for reactions with both spin-
orbit states. It is presented, here and in all of the following
plots, relative to the kinematic cutoff of Ar+(2P1/2). We ob-
serve predominantly forward scattering for both energies with
a small backwards fraction. The internal energy distribution
is sharply peaked corresponding to an internal excitation that
lies slightly above the energy expected for the excitation of
v = 2 resulting from a reaction with Ar+(2P1/2) for both
collision energies. We expect rotational excitation of the H+
2
resulting in additional internal excitation, which explains the
shift of the peak to higher internal energy. The width of the
peak at 0.1 eV relative energy is 80 meV (FWHM) and there-
fore several times broader than the experimental broadening.

3

This lets us conclude that multiple states, which are individ-
ually broadened by the experimental uncertainties, contribute
to the total width. At 0.28 eV collision energy the internal
energy distribution is broader (182 meV), slightly shifted to
higher internal energy and more symmetric. At this collision
energy two more state combinations are energetically allowed:
H+
2 (v = 2) resulting from a reaction with Ar+(2P3/2) at an
internal energy of 0.71 eV and H+
2 (v = 3) after reaction with
Ar+(2P1/2) at 0.77 eV.

From the internal energy distribution, we can conclude that
a lot of energy is transferred to internal excitation. The charge
transfer reaction is exothermic by 0.51 eV regarding the spin-
orbit excited state. All of the released energy is converted into
internal excitation and some additional energy is converted
from initial kinetic energy to internal degrees of freedom. This
leads to slower average velocities of the H+
2 products com-
pared to the initial neutral molecules. This difference can be
clearly seen when we compare the initial mean velocity of
the neutral beam, represented by the black arrow pointing left
drawn into the velocity distribution in the top panel of FIG. 2,
to the position of the main peak of the H+
2 product distribu-
tion.

In the low energy part of the internal energy distribu-
tion other state combinations contribute. Reactions with
Ar+(2P3/2) resulting in H+
2 (v = 1) should appear at 0.45 eV
and with Ar+(2P1/2) resulting in H+
2 (v = 1) at 0.28 eV. The
high energy part of the internal energy is limited by the maxi-
mum available energy: 0.61 eV and 0.79 eV respectively. This
explains the sharp drop and the resulting asymmetric peak
shape in the 0.1 eV collision energy data.

From the angular distributions we can immediately see that
the backwards contribution is very small compared to the
forward-scattered peak. At the lower collision energy a larger
backward-scattered fraction as well as scattering into larger
angles is observed. The backward-scattered peak lies at even
lower velocities corresponding to higher internal excitation of
the H+
2 ions. As this cannot be easily inferred from the scat-
tering image due to the low fraction of backward-scattered
product ions, we show the internal energy distribution for a
45° cone in forward (solid lines) and backward (dashed lines)
direction in FIG. 4. The backward fraction is enhanced by a
factor of ten. One can clearly see a shift towards higher inter-
nal energy in the backward-scattered fraction.

The results for the charge transfer reaction with D2 are de-
picted in FIG. 3. The rings drawn into the center-of-mass
velocity distribution again correspond to the kinematic cutoff
and the vibrational levels of D+
2 for reactions with Ar+(2P1/2)
(white) and Ar+(2P3/2) (red). The vibrational spacing in D+
2
is very close to the energy spacing between the two spin-orbit
states of Ar+. This makes it challening to disentangle the ini-
tial Ar+ state that is involved in the reaction.

We observe forward scattering with a small backward
contribution. At the lower investigated collision energy of
0.33 eV the forward peak position lies energetically above the
internal energy corresponding to the D+
2 vibrational level v =
1 and v = 2 for a reaction with Ar+(2P3/2) and Ar+(2P1/2)
respectively. The two higher-lying vibrational levels v = 2
and v = 3 also overlap with the distribution. At 0.56 eV rel-

FIG. 2: H+

2 velocity distribution, internal energy and angular

distribution at 0.1 eV (left) and 0.28 eV (right) relative
collision energy. The rings drawn into the velocity
distribution correspond to the kinematic cutoff for
Ar+(2P1/2) (white rings) and Ar+(2P3/2) (red rings) and the

corresponding vibrational levels of H+
2 . The positions of
these levels are also shown as an inset axis in the internal
energy distribution. The internal energy distribution for
0.28 eV collision energy also shows the ﬁt of a sum of
Gaussians to the measured distribution (see text for details).

ative energy the peak is a lot broader and extends to higher
internal energy. At this collision energy higher-lying vibra-
tional states are energetically accessible and contribute to the
internal energy distribution. The closest vibrational levels of
D+
2 , energetically speaking, are v = 1 for Ar+(2P3/2) and
v = 2 for Ar+(2P1/2) (see FIG. 1). While it appears that they
contribute, especially considering rotational excitation, higher
vibrational levels are signiﬁcantly populated. At the higher
collision energy this effect is especially evident. In this regard
the data obtained for the reaction with D2 differs from the ex-
periments with H2, where the quasi-resonant vibrational state
is predominantly excited.

As in the reaction with H2 the backward fraction is larger at
lower collision energy. Overall the back-scattered fraction is
larger in the reaction with D2 compared to the H2 results. The
internal energy distributions are signiﬁcantly broader com-
pared to the reaction with H2. This broadening partially stems
from the fact that the presented internal energy plots are in-

tegrated over all angles. One can already infer from the scat-
tering image that the backward-scattered ions appear at lower
velocities. Thus, they are even higher internally excited and
appear at higher energies in the Eint plot. This behavior is
more pronounced in the D2 data due to the larger backward-
scattered fraction, but is also present for the reaction with H2.
To illustrate this we present the internal energy distribution of
a 45° cone cut from the total differential cross sections in both
forward and backward direction in the lower panel of FIG. 4.
The backward contribution is enhanced by a factor of 2 in
this plot. We observe a clear shift towards higher energy in
the back-scattered fraction. At the lower collision energy the
purely forward-scattered peak is much more symmetric com-
pared to the peak integrated over all angles shown in FIG. 3.
At 0.56 eV collision energy the forward-scattered peak does
not appear more symmetric, instead the right slope appears al-
most bimodal and the decrease is less steep, when compared
with the lower energy and the H2 data. This might be ex-
plained by larger contributions of the v = 3 and v = 4 as
well as v = 4 and v = 5 vibrational levels for Ar+(2P3/2) and
Ar+(2P1/2), respectively.

IV. DISCUSSION

The majority of the previous studies on this reaction fo-
cused on obtaining total or state-speciﬁc cross sections. In or-
der to compare these to our results we extract the approximate
amount of product ions in speciﬁc vibrational states for both
spin orbit states of the reacting Ar+ from the internal energy
distribution of the product ions. To this end we ﬁt seven Gaus-
sian functions, one for each combination of quantum states, to
the measured energy distribution at 0.28 eV collision energy
(see FIG. 2, right column, central panel). Each Gaussian has
a width of 150 meV(FWHM) and is positioned to the right
of the respective quantum state marker to account for rota-
tional excitation (see below). Assuming a statistical 2:1 ratio
of Ar+(2P3/2) to Ar+(2P1/2) reactants, we obtain from the ﬁt
that about 85% of the product ions originate from reactions
with Ar+(2P1/2). More than 90% of these product ions are
excited to v = 2. Correspondingly, we estimate the total con-
tribution from reactions with Ar+(2P3/2) to be approx. 15%.
Here the majority (∼ 90%) is excited to v = 1. For the cross

5

section ratio σP1/2 / σP3/2 this yields a value of about 6. This
is in good agreement with previous studies, which found ratios
of 5 to 13 at similar collision energies38.

We also compare our results with the one previous angle-
and energy differential cross section measurement of the
charge transfer channel. Hierl et al. investigated the re-
action at three relative collision energies 0.13, 0.48 and
3.44 eV using rotatable crossed beams and a ﬁxed detector
arrangement26. They used a thermal hydrogen beam emit-
ted by a multi capillary array as their neutral beam source.
From their published angular distribution at 0.13 eV we esti-
mate the backward-scattered fraction, compared to the amount
of forward-scattered product ions, to be larger than 70%. Our
experiments show a signiﬁcantly smaller backward-scattered
fraction below 10% at a collision energy of 0.1 eV. While a
similar trend of decreasing backward-scattered fraction with
increasing collision energy is observed in both experiments,
there is also a disagreement for the higher energy data. In their
data for 0.48 eV collision energy a higher fraction (> 15%) is
scattered backwards compared to our data for 0.3 eV (8%).
In their published velocity contour maps the position of the
main peak in forward direction lies slightly above the velocity
corresponding to H+
2 (v = 2), which they label as ’resonant
charge transfer (RCT)’. In our measurements the main peak
lies below this velocity. We attribute this additional internal
excitation in our results to rotational excitation as discussed
below. The shift in energy might be due to the thermal H2
beam used in their experiments, when compared to our data
obtained from collisions with a supersonic, colder H2 beam.

Both Hierl et al. and the present work observe scattering
into larger angles and enhanced backward scattering at lower
collision energies. This indicates that small impact param-
eter collisions play a more important role at lower collision
energies. A similar attribution of scattering into large angles
to small impact parameter collisions was also done by Trip-
pel et al. in the investigation of the Ar+ + N2 charge transfer
reaction51. The main peak in the backward-scattered fraction
is observed at lower product velocities than the forward peak,
corresponding to even more transfer of kinetic energy into in-
ternal excitation, as already discussed in the results section.
This shift for the peak in backward direction has also been
observed in the experiments by Hierl et al. .

The simulated angular distribution published by Liao et al.
shows forward scattering with the addition of rainbow-angle
scattering at relatively high collision energies (1.44 eV)38.
This feature would smear out due to the limited resolution of
our experiment and the presence of rotational excitation, but
should still appear as a ’dip’ in the angular distribution. We
do not observe any change in the slope of the angular distribu-
tions at angles between 25-30° and therefore do not observe
any indication of rainbow scattering.

In the following we consider the role of product rotational
excitation in the studied reaction. As noted above, we at-
tribute the shift of the forward-scattered peak from the ex-
pected quasi-resonant vibrational level to additional rotational
excitation. To determine the amount of excitation we have to
assess the rotational state population prior to reaction. Pre-

FIG. 5: Internal energy distributions of the charge transfer
reaction with H2. The inset axes mark rotational levels of the
H+
2 products for the involved Ar+ spin-orbit states and H+
2
vibrational levels. Para-H2 rotational levels are depicted as
downward-pointing and ortho-H2 levels as upward-pointing
ticks.

pansions have shown that the rotational state population cools
almost completely to the ortho- and para-H2 ground states59.
Most of the population was found to end up in J = 0 and
J = 1 for para- and ortho-H2 respectively with contributions
of a few percent in J = 2 and J = 3. Based on this we expect
a statistical mixture of mostly ground state ortho- and para-
H2, speciﬁcally in a ratio of 3:1 and the two species can not
inter-convert through reactive collisions.

We present the area-normalized internal energy distribu-
tions of the reaction with H2 in FIG. 5. To exclude contri-
butions from the backward fraction we only consider product
ions in a forward cone with a half-angle of 30°. When ana-
lyzing the product rotational states we assume that the rota-
tional angular momentum quantum number can only change
by a multiple of two due to the symmetry of the interac-
tion potential. The four inset axes mark the energy of rota-
tional states J + of H+
2 corresponding to different originat-
ing Ar+ spin-orbit and vibrational states up to J + = 8. The
upward-pointing ticks show the odd-numbered rotational lev-
els for collisions with ortho-H2 and the downward-pointing
ticks show the energy of the rotational levels when colliding
with para-H2. The vertical dotted lines mark the rotational
ground state of H+
2 (J + = 0) and serve only as a visual guide.
In the following discussion we often refer to product rovibra-
tional states (v, J +) along with the originating spin-orbit state
Ar+(2PJ) and will use the notation (v, J +)PJ . Spin-rotation
coupling in the hydrogen ions is very small and safely ignored.
The peak maximum at 0.1 eV collision energy corresponds to
an energy close to (v = 2, J + = 2)P1/2. We interpret the peak
as an overlap of population in J + = 1 − 4 of this vibrational
level as well as contributions from rotational levels of the vi-
brational level (v = 1)P3/2. The maximum available energy is
very close to (v = 2, J + = 5)P1/2. Despite the lower reaction
rate a contribution from (v = 1, J +)P3/2 is not surprising, be-

6

cause there is twice as much population in this spin-orbit state.
We attribute the slowly increasing slope in the low internal en-
ergy part to contributions from (v = 1, J +)P1/2. Only highly
excited rotational levels of this state overlap with the main
peak.

In the internal energy distribution corresponding to the
higher relative energy of 0.28 eV shown in red, the peak is
broader and is shifted towards higher internal excitation. The
center of the peak lies close to (v = 2, J + = 4)P1/2 and
(v = 2, J + = 5)P1/2. The maximum available energy of
0.78 eV allows for rotational states of this vibrational level up
to J + = 8 to be populated and contributions from another
state in the right slope: (v = 2, J +)P3/2 . We can conclude
that a large fraction of the additional translational energy is
converted into internal energy and that even higher rotational
states are excited. Given that most of the neutral H2 molecules
are in the lowest ortho- and para-states, efﬁcient excitation of
multiple quanta of rotation in one reactive collision is needed
to explain the observed internal energy distributions.

To estimate the orbital angular momentum of the reactants
we consider the charge transfer distance of about 5 ˚A as an
upper limit for the impact parameter of the Ar+ + H2 colli-
sion. As described in the introduction this value is larger than
the maximum impact parameter obtained from the Langevin
model. At the collision energy of 0.28 eV we estimate the an-
gular momentum for this maximum impact parameter to be
about 90 ~. For the forward-scattered ﬂux we assume a min-
imum impact parameter of at least 1.5 ˚A, based on a simple
geometric estimate of the extent of the repulsive wall of the
interaction potential. Even at this lower limit the total angular
momentum is about 25 ~. Thus, the angular momentum avail-
able to forward scattering is clearly large enough to allow for
the rotational excitation up to J = 8 for H+
2 in v = 2 at
0.28 eV collision energy. Higher rotational excitations would
also be possible given the available angular momentum, but
they are energetically inaccessible at this vibrational level.

As a model to rationalize the large angular momentum
transfer from orbital angular momentum to hydrogen rotation
we suggest a two-step process. At the large internuclear sep-
aration around the charge transfer distance an electron moves
from H2 to Ar+. This changes the interaction potential to
an effective Ar-H+
2 potential, which is much more attractive
than the Ar+-H2 potential as mentioned in the introduction.
Rotationally inelastic scattering on this potential energy sur-
face may then lead to the rotational excitation of the hydrogen
molecular ion. Such inelastic cross sections can be substan-
tial, as recently calculated for the He-H+

2 system60.

For backward-scattered products we observe even more en-
ergy partitioning into internal excitation. At an impact param-
eter of 0.5 ˚A the angular momentum is still 8 ~ meaning an
excitation to high rotational levels is still feasible but must be
vastly more efﬁcient than for the forward-cattered products. In
line with the suggested two-step model this implies that this
efﬁciency, which depends on the details of the involved poten-
tial surface, is substantially different in the repulsive region at
short range. Detailed theoretical calculations are needed to
test this model quantitatively in comparison with the experi-
mental data.

 
V. CONCLUSION

We obtained angle- and energy-differential cross sections
for the charge transfer reaction of Ar+(2PJ ) with H2(X, v =
0, J) and D2(X, v = 0, J).
In both reactions we observe
predominantly forward scattering with a small backward-
scattered fraction. In the case of reactions with H2 we can
attribute most of the H+
2 product ions to reactions with spin-
orbit excited Ar+ resulting in vibrationally excited H+
2 in
v = 2 for both investigated collision energies. This resonant
coupling into a speciﬁc state is likely due to the small energy
difference between the spin-orbit excited state and this vibra-
tional state of the product.

For the isotopic reaction no energetically resonant state ex-
ists as the vibrational states of D2 are shifted compared to H2.
This changes the observed product state distribution. Instead
of predominant coupling to a single product state we observe
excitation of multiple vibrational states.

We also ﬁnd that the product ions are rotationally excited.
At the lower relative energy studied in the reaction with H2
they are excited up to the maximum available rotational state.
At the higher collision energy multiple rotational quanta are
excited in a single reactive collision. We observe a large trans-
fer of energy into internal excitation, even of initial kinetic
energy, despite the exoergic nature of the reaction. At low rel-
ative energy we observe scattering into larger angles and an
increased amount of back-scattered products for both neutral
species. The products that are scattered backwards show even
more internal excitation. For the reaction with D2 we observe
an overall increase in the backward-scattered fraction when
compared to H2.

We have suggested a simple two-step model to rational-
ize the rotational excitation in the molecular reaction product.
Detailed quantum scattering calculations would be helpful to
test this. Furthermore, they could help understand the discrep-
ancy in the cross section for backward and forward-scattered
products and the disparity in the internal excitation of the for-
ward and backward ﬂux. It seems despite the decade-spanning
study of this fundamental three-atom ion-molecule reaction
we still do not fully understand the mechanisms involved and
we hope this work will stimulate further investigations.
