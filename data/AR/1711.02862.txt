We review the current status of the leptogenesis scenario originally proposed
by Akhmedov, Rubakov and Smirnov (ARS). It takes place in the parametric
regime where the right-handed neutrinos are at the electroweak scale or below
and the CP-violating eﬀects are induced by the coherent superposition of diﬀer-
ent right-handed mass eigenstates. Two main theoretical approaches to derive
quantum kinetic equations, the Hamiltonian time evolution as well as the Closed-
Time-Path technique are presented, and we discuss their relations. For scenarios
with two right-handed neutrinos, we chart the viable parameter space. Both, a
Bayesian analysis, that determines the most likely conﬁgurations for viable lep-
togenesis given diﬀerent variants of ﬂat priors, and a determination of the max-
imally allowed mixing between the light, mostly left-handed, and heavy, mostly
right-handed, neutrino states are discussed. Rephasing invariants are shown to
be a useful tool to classify and to understand various distinct contributions to
ARS leptogenesis that can dominate in diﬀerent parametric regimes. While these
analyses are carried out for the parametric regime where initial asymmetries are

generated predominantly from lepton-number conserving, but ﬂavor violating ef-

and identify the regions of parameter space where these are relevant.

1. Introduction

One of the most interesting implications of the extensions of the Standard Model
(SM) with massive neutrinos is the possibility to explain the baryon asymmetry in
the Universe via leptogenesis [1]. This mechanism has been shown to be robust and
generic in seesaw models that involve a very high scale of new physics, much higher
that the electroweak scale, MN (cid:29) v. In the standard scenarios, leptogenesis takes
place during the freeze-out of some heavy states that can decay violating charge-
parity CP and lepton number L. These high-scale scenarios have been studied
extensively. For comprehensive reviews see [2] .

Akhmedov, Rubakov and Smirnov [3] (ARS) studied the possibility to generate a
baryon asymmetry in type I seesaw models at a much lower scale, MN (cid:46) v. The key
observation is that the small Yukawa couplings required to explain neutrino masses
in this low-scale scenario could be small enough to ensure that some of the sterile
states [also referred to as right-handed (RH) neutrinos] might not reach thermal
equilibrium before the electroweak phase transition, when sphaleron processes are
switched oﬀ. ARS leptogenesis therefore is a freeze-in scenario. Pending on the
parametric regime, lepton-number violating (LNV) processes may be negligible both
in the generation of the asymmetries as well as in the washout because the Majorana
mass of the RH neutrinos is small compared to the temperature. In that situation,
the initial asymmetries in active leptons are purely ﬂavored and lepton-number
conserving (LNC), and eventually total asymmetries in the active sector arise and
are approximatly counterbalanced by those in the sterile sector. If this situation

4

survives until the electroweak phase transition, a net baryon asymmetry results,
since the eventual equilibration later on can no longer be transmitted to the baryons
in the absence of eﬃcient sphaleron transitions. In other regions of parameter space
LNV contributions may be relevant or even dominating in the source as well as
washout terms and then must be accounted for. The aim of this chapter is to
review the ARS mechanism of leptogenesis.

The model involves the simplest extension of the SM with nR heavy Majorana

where Nk are RH spinors (such that PRNk = Nk), λ is a 3 × nR complex matrix,
MN is a nR-dimensional complex symmetric matrix, and φc = (cid:15)φ∗. The spectrum
of this theory contains three lighter states with a mass matrix given by the famous
seesaw formula

Mν = −

where v = 246 GeV, and nR heavy ones with masses of O(MN ). The naive seesaw
scaling (exact for one family) relating Yukawas with the light and heavy masses is
therefore Mν ∼ O( v2y2
2MN

), where y is speciﬁed through (3) below.
In most of this work we will assume the minimal scenarios where nR = 2, 3.
Diﬀerent parametrizations of the Yukawa matrices have been used in the literature.
For some purposes the parametrization in terms of the two unitary matrices that
bi-diagonalize λ is useful:

λ = V †diag(y1, y2, y3)W.
For the purpose of parameter scanning however the Casas-Ibarra [4] parametrization
is most appropriate. For nR = 2 it reads:

where Uν is the PMNS matrix, M diag
is the diagonal matrix of the light neutrino
masses (note that the lightest neutrino is massless because only two Majorana
singlets are included), MN ≡ M diag
N = diag(M1, M2), where M1, M2 are the heavy
neutrino masses and without loss of generality, we choose the mass basis for the RH
neutrinos, PNO is a 3 × 2 matrix that depends on the neutrino ordering (NH, IH)

2. Sakharov Conditions

As it is well known, three necessary Sakharov conditions need to be met in order
to generate a baryon asymmetry from a symmetric initial condition. The model of
Eq. (1) satisﬁes all of them:

• Baryon number B is violated by sphaleron processes
• C and CP violation

Charge C is violated maximally, while CP violation arises from the complex
nature of the ﬂavor parameters Y and MN . After performing all the allowed ﬁeld
rephasings, it is easy to see that 3(6) physical CP-violating phases exist for nR =
2(3).

• Out-of-equilibrium condition

Assuming that the only interactions of the singlets nR are the Yukawa couplings
in Eq. (1), it is easy to estimate when the states will reach thermal equilibrium. The
scattering rate of the sterile states at temperature T is roughly Γs(T ) ∼ y2T , with
y deﬁned in Eq. (3). Comparing this to the Hubble expansion rate in a radiation
dominated universe, and using the naive seesaw scaling:

P = MPl

where TEW ∼ 140 GeV is the temperature of the electroweak phase transition,
(cid:112)45/(4π3g∗), MPl is the Planck mass, and g∗ the eﬀective number of
M ∗
relativistic degrees of freedom at the temperature T . This naive estimate shows that
the singlet states thermalize quite close to the electroweak phase transition so it is
not unnatural to have at least one state that has not reached thermal equilibrium
by the time the sphaleron processes switch oﬀ.

As it is well known, CP-violating observables such as a lepton asymmetry, require
the quantum interference of diﬀerent amplitudes that involve diﬀerent CP-violating
phases as well as CP conserving ones. While in the standard scenario of leptogenesis
from out-of-equilibrium decay the CP-conserving phases can be computed from the
absorptive parts of the one-loop amplitudes, in the ARS case they are most suitably
described by oscillations among the RH neutrinos.a Indeed the sterile states are
produced in ﬂavor combinations that get modiﬁed in propagation, because they are
a superposition of the mass eigenstates. Two scales are therefore relevant in the
generation of the asymmetry the time when the oscillation rate is similar to the
Hubble expansion or oscillation time

aNote that in the resonant regime of standard leptogenesis, both descriptions, in terms of os-
cillations or absorptive loop contributions can be valid and in the extremely resonant limit, the
oscillation picture can be more suitable. We refer to Refs. [5–8] as well as the accompanying review
article on resonant leptogenesis [9] for further details.

(9)

Unless the mass eigenstates are extremely degenerate, there is a hierarchy of scales:

tosc (cid:28) teq ∼ tEW .

(10)

Note however that there are several ﬂavors and therefore several oscillation and
equilibration rates.

The generation of the asymmetry in the diﬀerent ﬂavors is eﬀective at t ∼ tosc,
so it takes place at temperatures much higher than the electroweak phase transition.
At later times, when oscillations are very fast, quantum eﬀects are no longer possible
and the lepton asymmetries no longer grow, but the total lepton asymmetry keeps
evolving because the equilibration rate of diﬀerent ﬂavors is diﬀerent. After all
the states reach the equilibration time t > teq, the asymmetry drops exponentially.
If the EW phase transition happens before that, the subsequent evolution of the
lepton asymmetries no longer aﬀects the baryons and therefore whatever baryon
asymmetry survives until tEW remains.

3. CP invariants and naive estimates

CP-violating observables should be ﬂavor basis invariant and be sensitive to the
physical phases.
In the case where we can consider all the ﬂavor parameters as
small so that we can Taylor expand in them, it is easy to ﬁnd the basis independent
invariants that usually require a minimum power of the ﬂavor parameters. These
invariants are useful because they allow to estimate the size of the asymmetry rather
simply.

A well-known example is that of the SM with massless neutrinos. There is
only one physical CP-violating phase in the quark sector and the lowest-order basis
invariant combination of the Yukawas is the famous Jarlskog invariant:

d), (11)

ijViiV ∗

where J ≡ Im[V ∗
jiVjj] and V is the CKM matrix. The invariant ICP contains
two factors: a rephasing invariant, the J factor, that depends on mixing angles,
which ensures that the phase becomes unphysical if any of the mixing angle van-
ishes, and a GIM factor that depends on the quark mass diﬀerences, which ensures
that the same thing happens if any two quarks are degenerate. Any ﬂavor-blind
CP-violating observable such as the baryon asymmetry, if generated at TEW in elec-
troweak baryogenesis scenarios for example, is expected to be proportional to ICP ,
which fails by many orders of magnitude as is found by direct computation [10–12].

7

In the seesaw model the situation is much more complicated because there are
three/six independent CP-violating phases for nR = 2/3. The ﬂavor or weak basis
(WB) invariants are constructed from products of the lepton Yukawa and mass
matrices. Those sensitive to the CP-violating phases have been derived in [13] within
the minimal type I seesaw model: all of them should vanish if CP is conserved, and
conversely the non-vanishing of any of these invariants signals CP violation. They
are invariant under the basis transformations:

(cid:96) → VL(cid:96) ,
eR → VReR ,
N → WRN ,
where eR are the RH charged leptons of the SM. In general, there are 3 ×(nR − 1)
independent phases, and thus the same number of independent WB invariants.
For nR = 3, three CP-violating WB invariants can be constructed using just the
neutrino Yukawa and mass matrices. Deﬁning h = λ†λ, and HM = M †
N MN , they
can be written as:

(12)

I1 ≡ ImTr[hHM M ∗
M M ∗
I2 ≡ ImTr[hH 2
M M ∗
I3 ≡ ImTr[hH 2

N h∗MN ],
N h∗MN ],
N h∗MN HM ] .

(13)

(14)

(15)

Since the Ia are WB invariants, we can evaluate them in any basis.
In the
WB where the sterile neutrino mass matrix MN is real and diagonal (MN =
Diag(M1, · · · , MnR )), one obtains:
(cid:88)

Ia =

Im(h2

ij)ga(Mi, Mj) ,

(16)

j

j , g2(Mi, Mj) = MiM 5

with g1(Mi, Mj) = MiM 3
j . From
the above equations one can see that in the case nR = 2 there is only one indepen-
dent CP-violating invariant, which at lowest order in the sterile neutrino masses is
I1. Note that the quantities Im(h2
ij) = Im[(λ†λ)2
ij] are related to the CP asymme-
tries which appear in unﬂavored leptogenesis via heavy Majorana neutrino decay,

j and g3(Mi, Mj) = M 3

i M 5

(cid:15)i ∝

(cid:88)

j

Im[(λ†λ)2

ij] f (Mi, Mj) ,

(17)

where f is a loop a function.

The remaining independent WB invariants that can be constructed involve also
the charged lepton Yukawa couplings, λ(cid:96). Since ARS leptogenesis occurs at T (cid:29) M ,
CP-violating phases associated with the Majorana character of the sterile neutrinos
are suppressed by M/T (cid:28) 1 and do not play any role, if these eﬀects are neglected.
In this case, the appropriate CP-violating invariants at lowest order for nR = 3 are
(only the ﬁrst one for nR = 2):
¯I (cid:48)
1 ≡ ImTr[hH 2

In the case nR = 2, we ﬁnd the third independent WB invariant at higher order in
λ, ImTr[h2H 2

¯hHM ].

One can also construct WB invariants involving λ(cid:96) and sensitive to Majorana
phases, related to the ﬂavored CP asymmetries in heavy neutrino decays, by just
changing the matrix h by ¯h in Eqs. (13)–(15) [13], but they contain the same phases
as the ones described here.

Note however that in ARS leptogenesis (and more generally in ﬂavored lepto-
genesis), charged lepton Yukawa couplings are not small parameters: in fact, they
mediate fast interactions that are resummed in the Boltzmann equations, leading
to density matrices diagonal in the charged lepton mass basis. Therefore for the
relevant CP-violating observables a perturbative expansion in the charged lepton
Yukawas does not work, but rather a projection on the diﬀerent ﬂavors: the total
lepton asymmetry is an incoherent sum of the ﬂavor lepton asymmetries, which
evolve independently. As a consequence the WB invariants ¯Ii do not appear in
the ﬁnal result, but the structure of the ﬂavored CP-asymmetries is dictated by
Eq. (22): for instance the (L-conserving) CP asymmetry in ﬂavor α produced in
the decay of the sterile neutrino i is (see the accompanying article [14])

(cid:15)iα ∝

(cid:88)

j

Im[(λ†Pαλ)ji(λ†λ)ij] f (Mi, Mj) =

Im[λαiλ∗

αj(λ†λ)ij] f (Mi, Mj) ,

(cid:88)

j

(23)
where Pα is the projector on ﬂavor α; and in ARS leptogenesis, where all sterile
neutrino species contribute, one ﬁnds

∆α =

(cid:88)

i,j

Im[λαiλ∗

αj(λ†λ)ij] ˜f (Mi, Mj) .

(24)

We can still use the above WB invariants to estimate the size of the baryon asymme-
try, in particular its dependence on the neutrino Yukawa couplings, λ, in processes
like ARS leptogenesis which are ﬂavor blind. From the above equations, we see
that it must be at least fourth order in λ, however it turns out that (cid:80)
α ∆α = 0,
therefore the baryon number asymmetry, which is proportional to the sum of all
the ﬂavored asymmetries, should be O(λ6). Thus the ﬁnal asymmetry in ARS is
expected to have the form

Y∆B ∝

(cid:88)

(λλ†)αα∆α .

α

(25)

This reﬂects the fact that the CP asymmetries ∆α (and (cid:15)iα) are lepton number
conserving: a net lepton number asymmetry is generated only because each ﬂavor

9

lepton asymmetry evolves at a diﬀerent rate. Notice that in the case of heavy Majo-
rana neutrino decays, in general there is an additional piece of the CP-asymmetry,

¯(cid:15)iα ∝

(cid:88)

j

Im[λ∗

αiλαj(λ†λ)ij] g(Mi, Mj)

(26)

which violates lepton number and does not vanish when summed over all ﬂavors.
Only in purely ﬂavored leptogenesis, or in inverse seesaw scenarios where ¯(cid:15)iα (cid:28) (cid:15)iα,
a similar cancellation occurs.

However the dependence of the baryon asymmetry on λ may change if one of the
lepton ﬂavors α is almost decoupled when the sphalerons freeze out, while the others
have equilibrated; in this case the Yukawa couplings of the fast interacting species
are not small parameters. Then, by lepton number conservation the asymmetry
sequestered in the ﬂavor α is equal and opposite to the asymmetry in the rest of
the leptonic sector, which is partially transformed into the baryon asymmetry. In
this situation, the ﬁnal result is O(λ4).

Even if the ﬁnal asymmetry is not WB invariant, in any basis there is still the
freedom to make phase rotations of the lepton ﬁelds, and the physical quantities
must be invariant under such rephasings. As a consequence, the CP-violating ob-
servables can be written in terms of independent rephasing invariants, as described
in [15]. In order to ﬁnd these, it is convenient to write explicitly the unitary matri-
ces V, W with the 3 ×(nR − 1) phases that remain physical after all allowed ﬁeld
rephasing transformations. For nR = 3 we have

W = U (θ12, θ13, θ23, δ)†Diag(1, eiα1, eiα2)
V = Diag(1, eiφ1 , eiφ2)U (θ(cid:48)
23, δ(cid:48)) ,

13, θ(cid:48)

12, θ(cid:48)

(27)

(28)

where U (θi, δi) represents the standard parameterization of a 3×3 mixing matrix,
with 3 angles and 1 phase. Notice that the phases φi only enter in processes which
depend on both, V and W , involving ν, N and charged leptons; ﬂavored and ARS
leptogenesis are an example of such processes, while unﬂavored leptogenesis depends
only on λ†λ, and therefore on W .

The Majorana phases of W , α1,2 are determined by two independent invariants of
the form Im[(WαjW ∗
αi)2], while the Jarlskog invariant JW = −Im[W ∗
32W33]
determines the phase δ. For nR = 2, there is a single Majorana phase in W , given by
11)2]. When considering the parametric regime
the rephasing invariant Im[(W12W ∗
of ARS leptogenesis where the Majorana nature of the sterile neutrinos does not
play a role, only the Dirac phase δ will be relevant and therefore we expect to ﬁnd
just the Jarlskog invariant of the matrix W, only in the case nR = 3.

23W22W ∗

The remaining invariants involve also the matrix V . They can be chosen as
the Jarlskog invariant JV and two combinations of the form Im[W ∗
2αW2i] for
two reference values of i, α, which ﬁx all the phases in the matrix V (δ(cid:48), φ1, φ2).
If nR = 2, there are only two more independent phases (δ(cid:48), φ1), and therefore two
independent rephasing invariants.

1iV1αV ∗

10

We can now write the CP asymmetries that appear in ARS leptogenesis in terms

of the rephasing invariants as:

Im[(λ†Pαλ)ji(λ†λ)ij] =

(cid:88)

β,δ,σ

yβyδy2

σ Im[W ∗

βiVβαV ∗

δαWδjWσiW ∗

σj] .

(29)

In turn, all these invariants can be written in terms of the 6 (3) independent ones
for nR = 3(2) by using the unitarity of the mixing matrices V, W .

Since the Majorana phases of W do not contribute in the limit of small sterile
neutrino Majorana masses that we are considering, we are left with 4 (2) invariants
for nR = 3(2). The result can be further simpliﬁed using that one of the sterile
neutrinos is very weakly coupled, so in the approximation of neglecting y3 (cid:28) y1, y2
we obtain:

Im[λαiλ∗

αj(λ†λ)ij] = y2

(30)

Moreover, it can be shown that in this limit the phase φ2 of the matrix V does not
appear in Eq. (30), thus only three independent invariants contribute for nR = 3,
which we can choose as:

I (2)
1 = −Im[W ∗
I (3)
1 = Im[W ∗

Although JW can be related to the above invariants, it is simpler to write
the ﬁnal baryon asymmetry for nR = 3 in terms of the four rephasing invari-
ants {I (2)
2 , JW }. In the case nR = 2, only the two independent invariants,
1 , I (3)
{I (2)

1 , I (3)

4. Quantum kinetic equations

The generation of lepton asymmetries is a purely quantum phenomenon and will
therefore be missed in any classical treatment of the production of the sterile species.
A related physical problem is that of oscillating neutrinos in the early Universe for
which a formalism based on quantum kinetic equations was developed a long time
ago [16]. Other approaches have been proposed [5, 17], and while there is not yet a
fully uniﬁed formulation, diﬀerent methods seem to give similar results.

There are two basic ingredients in any formulation of the problem: the dispersion
relation of sterile neutrinos in a thermal plasma or refractive index and the scattering
rates.

11

4.1. Dispersion relations of sterile neutrinos in a thermal plasma

The relativistic RH neutrinos acquire dispersive corrections from the thermal loop
made up of Higgs and lepton doublets that can become of quantitative importance in
certain parametric regions. This is in particular the case for strong mass degeneracy
among the RH neutrinos or large active-sterile mixing, i.e.
in the overdamped
regime (cf. Sec. 5.3.2 and Sec. 6.2), where the damping time scale (or the scale
associated with scattering rates) is of the same order or faster than the time scale of
oscillations. This well-known refractive eﬀect is calculated in the general context of
fermions at ﬁnite temperature in Ref. [18]. Away from the mass-degenerate regime,
the thermal mass corrections appear at next-to-leading order and are therefore
subdominant. For leptogenesis in the strong washout regime, this aspect is discussed
in the accompanying article [19].

4.2. Collision rates

For ultrarelativistic RH neutrinos, the phase space for reactions N ↔ (cid:96)φ is sup-
pressed at leading order and only opens up when Standard Model interactions, in
particular mediated by gauge and top-quark Yukawa couplings are included. The
leading logarithmic correction turns out to originate from the t-channel exchange
of a doublet lepton (cid:96) in a 2 ↔ 2 process with gauge radiation. Beyond the leading
logarithm, also the leading order eﬀects from hard scatterings as well as dispersive
thermal eﬀects have been computed.

The production of ultrarelativistic RH neutrinos has ﬁrst been calculated us-
ing the imaginary-time formalism of thermal ﬁeld theory in Refs. [20, 21]. The
derivation in the Closed-Time-Path formalism can be found in Ref. [22]. While it
appears not to be of immediate consequence for ARS leptogenesis in the mass-range
considered here, the interpolation between the production of ultrarelativistic and
non-relativistic RH neutrinos is addressed in Refs. [23, 24]. More important may
be the eﬀects on the rate from the slowly evolving Higgs ﬁeld expectation value
through the electroweak crossover that is computed in Ref. [25], but this has not
yet been implemented in a phenomenological calculation on ARS leptogenesis. In
the accompanying article [19], a detailed discussion of these matters is provided in
Sec. 3.2.

4.3. Raﬀelt-Sigl formalism

The starting point of this formalism is to consider the time evolution of number
density matrices represented by the expectation values of the number density op-
erators for the particle states (right-helicity states) and antiparticles (left-helicity
states):

(cid:104)a†
(cid:104)b†

j(k)ai(k(cid:48))(cid:105)T ≡(2π)3δ3(k − k(cid:48)) (ρ(k))ij ,
i (k)bj(k(cid:48))(cid:105)T ≡(2π)3δ3(k − k(cid:48)) (¯ρ(k))ij .

(34)

12

It is assumed that M/T eﬀects are negligible.
The diagonal elements of
(ρ(k))ii, (¯ρ(k))ii represent therefore the number density of the i-th sterile particles
with positive, negative helicity. By working out the time evolution of the number
density operators at second order in perturbation theory in the Yukawa interaction,
it can be shown [16] that the densities satisfy

(38)
and 1 ↔ 2 processes: φ → ¯(cid:96)N including resummed soft-gauge interactions. All
these contributions have been computed for vanishing leptonic chemical potential
in [21, 24, 26] and including the eﬀect of a leptonic chemical potential to linear
order in [27] .

Finally we need the equations that describe the evolution of the leptonic chemical
potentials. These are obtained from the equation that describes the evolution of the
conserved charges in the absence of neutrino Yukawas, that is the B
3 − Lα numbers,
where Lα is the lepton number in the ﬂavor α. These numbers can only be changed
by the same out of equilibrium processes that produce the sterile neutrinos and it
is possible to relate the integrated rates of these equations to those of the sterile
neutrinos and their densities:

It is interesting to compare these equations to those used in the literature. In the
seminal ARS paper [3], only top-quark scatterings were included, and the evolution
of the leptonic chemical potentials was neglected. The latter approximation turns
out to be too restrictive as an asymmetry builds up in the sterile sector only if at
least three sterile species are involved. This approximation missed the important
physical eﬀect that the plasma at the relevant temperatures erases any quantum
coherence in the charged leptons, which are in kinetic equilibrium also via their
Yukawa couplings. The plasma is able therefore to select a charged-lepton ﬂavor.
This important point was addressed by Asaka and Shaposhnikov [29, 30]. They took
into account the evolution of the leptonic chemical potentials and demonstrated that
lepton asymmetries could arise also in the minimal case with nR = 2. Compared to
Eq. (40) and Eq. (41), the equations of Refs. [29–32] included only top-quark scat-
terings, assumed Boltzmann statistics, neglected spectator eﬀects and all non-linear
terms in the equations, in particular those of O(µρN ). The latter approximation
was relaxed in Refs. [26, 33, 34].

Finally, in Ref. [35], the Boltzmann approximation was kept but all relevant
scatterings were included in the µ independent terms (and approximately for the
µ dependent ones), and spectator eﬀects were properly included by considering the
evolution of the B/3 − Lα chemical potentials.

4.4. Closed-Time-Path formalism

Provided the initial state is known, there are exact equations that in principle
describe the microscopic evolution of an ensemble of non-equilibrium systems. In a

15

classical theory, these are given by the Liouville equation. In quantum ﬁeld theory,
one may choose between an operator formalism leading to von Neumann equations,
as reviewed in Sec. 4.3, or a functional approach that we discuss in the present
section. The functional approach leads in a direct manner to Schwinger-Dyson
equations on the Closed-Time-Path (CTP) [36]. For practical reasons, the non-
equilibrium reactions that are the essence of particle cosmology are often described
by supplementing cross sections into classical Boltzmann equations, thus bypassing
the ﬁrst step of the program shown in Fig. 1.
In contrast to this practice, the
ARS scenario is mostly treated in the operator or the CTP approach from the
outset because at its core is the time evolution of quantum correlations among the
diﬀerent RH neutrinos. As indicated in Fig. 1, further simpliﬁcations, ideally by
applying controlled approximations, are necessary in order to make analytical or
numerically fast predictions that are suitable for phenomenological studies.

Both, operator and functional approach, start from ﬁrst principles, and there is
apparent beneﬁt in verifying results using these complementary methods. Interest-
ing features of the CTP approach that we mention before going into the technical-
ities are:

• The functional approach makes no reference to the interaction picture states
that are a necessary ingredient to the operator formalism. Rather, the
state of the system can be encoded in two-point functions. This can be
an advantage because in a realistic system, it is non-trivial to relate the
interaction picture states to the physical initial conditions, which are non-
Gaußian in general [37]. However, for leptogenesis as a weakly coupled
model, this is hardly an issue because the non-Gaußian correlations can be
reliably constructed using the straightforward perturbation expansion.
• The functional approach directly leads to Feynman rules on the CTP, which
appear to be more easily tractable than evaluating the commutators that
occur in the operator approach. Moreover, the CTP techniques are closely
related to the real-time formalism in equilibrium ﬁeld theory, such that it is
comparably simple to obtain the relevant self-energies in ﬁnite temperature

16

or non-equilibrium backgrounds for leptogenesis.

• Related to the previous point, all self-energies relevant for leptogenesis have
been evaluated in the CTP formalism (see e.g. Ref [22] for the self-energy
of relativistic RH neutrinos relevant in the ARS scenario), such that this
approach is self-contained.

We emphasize however that given the the standard perturbative expansion appro-
priate for leptogenesis as a weakly coupled theory and provided the same approx-
imations are made, operator-based and CTP approaches will also yield identical
results. At the present state of the art, the choice of method is therefore a matter
of preference, calculational transparency or convenience rather than accuracy.

After these more general remarks, we now apply the program sketched in Fig. 1
to derive the ﬂuid equations for ARS leptogenesis in the CTP framework. The
present emphasis is on the evolution of the state of the RH neutrinos, while the ﬂa-
vor dynamics of the active doublets from the perspective of the Schwinger-Keldysh
CTP formalism is presented in detail in the accompanying article on ﬂavored lepto-
genesis [14]. For now, we note that the ARS scenario is a variant of purely ﬂavored
leptogenesis because the initially produced total B − L asymmetry vanishes while
there are asymmetries in the individual ﬂavors. Further, we are in the fully ﬂavored
regime since the temperatures are low enough such that there are no coherent cor-
relations between the doublet ﬂavors because these are erased immediately by the
SM lepton Yukawa couplings, which mediate reactions that are fast compared to the
Hubble rate. The source for the asymmetry, i.e. the time derivative of the lepton
charge density is given by

(48)

i.e. with the Yukawa couplings stripped, and the spectral self-energy Σ/A
N (k) can be
interpreted as the cut part of the Higgs-lepton loop at ﬁnite temperature [5]. The
indices α, β = e, µ, τ denote the lepton ﬂavor, and we can delete the oﬀ-diagonal cor-
relations since we are in the fully ﬂavored regime. Since the two scenarios are closely
related, the CTP derivation of the expression (47) is discussed in the accompanying
review article on resonant leptogenesis [9].

Now we turn to the main focus of the present section, the computation of iδSN ij,
which is the out-of-equilibrium component of the statistical propagator of the RH
neutrinos N . The present discussion constitutes a summary of the elaboration in
Ref. [38], where more technical details are provided. The indices i, j denote the
RH neutrino ﬂavors, while spinor indices are suppressed. Note that for the RH
neutrinos, the oﬀ-diagonal correlations are crucial because these provide the CP-
even phases that are required in order to obtain a CP-violating eﬀect.

17

Formulation of the kinetic equations The Schwinger-Dyson equations on the
CTP are most straightforwardly formulated in terms of two-point functions. Let Ψ
be a spinor ﬁeld with mass matrix M , then the Wightman functions are given by
(49)
where ρ and σ are spinor indices, which we suppress in the following. Flavor indices
can be introduced straightforwardly. From these basic correlators, we can construct
the following Green’s functions:

ρσ(x1, x2) = −(cid:104) ¯Ψσ(x2)Ψρ(x1)(cid:105) ,

ρσ(x1, x2) = (cid:104)Ψρ(x1) ¯Ψσ(x2)(cid:105) ,

Corresponding quantities can be deﬁned for other two-point functions, in particular
for the self-energies /Σ, and we identity these by the same superscripts.

We take as the starting point for the derivation of kinetic equations Schwinger-
Dyson equations on the CTP, which are exact in principle, cf. the scheme outlined
in Fig. 1. We then make the transition from position into Wigner space through a
Fourier transformation with respect to the relative coordinate x1 − x2 while keeping
the average coordinate X = (x1 + x2)/2. For weakly coupled particles, the spectral
function then exhibits a quasi-particle peak at the mass shell, and the Wigner
space coordinate k can be interpreted as the four momentum. In Wigner space,
the convolution integrals take the form of a Moyal product [39–42]. The gradient
expansion consists (in the present spatially homogeneous case) of dropping temporal
derivatives that are of order of the Hubble rate (if the associated process is close to
equilibrium) or the particular relaxation rate (if the process is far from equilibrium).
At leading order, the Moyal product corresponds to an ordinary multiplication.

In order to isolate the non-equilibrium dynamics on top of the equilibrium back-
ground, we further decompose

H = ¯H + δH , G = ¯G + δG , S + = ¯S + + δS ,

(54)

where ¯H and ¯G are H and G evaluated in thermal equilibrium and with vanish-
ing chemical potentials. The two-point function ¯S + = ( ¯S > + ¯S <)/2 is a time-
independent static solution that satisﬁes the algebraic equation

[ ¯H, ¯S +] − [ ¯N , ¯S H ] =

(cid:0){ ¯G>, ¯S <} − { ¯G<, ¯S >}(cid:1) .

(55)

Eventually, to leading order in gradients, couplings and chemical potentials over
temperature, the non-equilibrium part of the statistical propagator is a solution to
the kinetic equation

The deviation from equilibrium due to the expansion of the Universe enters through
a non-vanishing ∂t ¯S +,b and the ﬁrst of the commutator terms leads to phase oscil-
lations in the oﬀ-diagonal ﬂavor correlations.

We now specialize to the case of ARS leptogenesis, where δSN denotes the
deviation of the propagators of the RH neutrinos (and their ﬂavor correlations) from
equilibrium. For that purpose, we can truncate the equations at second order in the
RH neutrino Yukawa couplings λ, and we expand up to linear order in the chemical
potentials of the doublet leptons and the Higgs bosons. In this approximation, the
terms involving δH and δN in Eq. (56) can be dropped, whereas the remaining
contributions can be wrapped up as

neutrinos.

Separation of the spinor structure To this end, δSN is still a product of a
spectral function with a statistical distribution. First, the spinor structure can be
factorized apart as

(60)

and where the functions g are Hermitian matrices in the space of RH neutrino
ﬂavors.
In this decomposition, there occur also left-handed components in the
correlations, i.e. δSN can be constructed from Majorana spinors. Due to the chiral
nature of the Yukawa interactions, these components are however projected out,
such that it would be also possible, but notationally perhaps more cumbersome, to
use purely RH spinors

We can now use the constraint equation (52a) in order to establish to leading

order in MN /k0 and λ the relations

g1h =

g2h =

1
2k0 ({(cid:60)MN , g0h} + [i(cid:61)MN , g3h]) ,

g3h = hsign(k0)g0h .

Quasi-particle approximation Eventually, we have reached the point where
we can factorize the spectral function from the quasiparticle distributions. For that
purpose, we can once more take Eq. (52a) and establish that

We emphasize that this quasi-particle approximation is derived from the constraint
equation and does not correspond to an ad hoc ansatz. The mass-square term Ω2
i
can be derived from the constraint equations or alternatively from the equations for
the retarded and advanced propagators. It includes the tree-level Majorana masses
as well as thermal corrections. However, since we work in the relativistic regime
where T (cid:29) MN i, we can approximate Ωi ≈ 0 up to a small error due to kinematic
corrections.

(65)

We can interpret δf0h(|k|, k) + fF (|k|) as the distribution function of particles
and 1 − δf0h(−|k|, k) − fF (−|k|) of antiparticles. For the heavy neutrinos, the
Majorana condition in the mass eigenbasis implies

δf0h(−k0) = δf ∗

0h(k0) ,

(66)

such that we only need to track the particle distribution, i.e. we can restrict to the
case sign(k0) = 1.

Taking the zeroth moment

Here, all quantities are evaluated on the zero-mass shell k0 = |k|, as it is valid in

The expansion of the Universe can be accounted for by using conformal time η,
which can be normalized during the radiation era as η = 1/T . It then follows that

(69)

where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to η. This equation for the dis-
tribution function is the analogue of Eq. (40) derived in the operator formalism.
The momentum |k| now denotes a comoving momentum from which we obtain the
physical one when dividing by the scale factor a = aRη, where aR is an arbitrary
parameter during radiation domination. Accordingly, T is a comoving temperature,

21

and we need to divide by a to obtain the physical temperature. Equation (69) is
a Boltzmann-like or quantum-Boltzmann equation that corresponds to the second
It can also be useful to trade η for the proportional but
step shown in Fig. 1.
dimensionless parameter z = Tref /T = ηTref . For the present problem, we choose
Tref = 130 GeV, which coincides with sphaleron freeze-out.

Since aR/a = T can be interpreted as a comoving temperature, the equilibrium

distribution for massless sterile neutrinos that appears in Eq. (69) is given by

f eq =

1
e|k|/aR + 1

,

(70)

which is independent of conformal time, such that the term f eq(cid:48)
in Eq. (69) vanishes.
This reﬂects a key diﬀerence between the ARS scenario and standard leptogenesis
in the strong washout regime: while in the latter case, the relevant deviation from
equilibrium is due to the fact that red shift drives the distribution of massive RH
neutrinos away from the Fermi-Dirac form, in the present case, the deviation from
equilibrium is given as an initial condition, where it is usually assumed that the RH
neutrino distributions are vanishing in ﬁrst place.

Reduction to ﬂuid equations Equation (69) would render leading order accu-
rate predictions, given the approximations that we have discussed to this end as well
as the required input from the loop functions. The reduced Hermitian self energy
ˆΣHµ is simply given by the well known real part of the thermal loop made up from
a Higgs boson and a doublet lepton [18] (cf. the discussion in Sec. 4.1), whereas the
reduced spectral self energy ˆΣAµ is dominated by a cut that involves gauge radiation
or top-quark pair-production [20–22] (cf. the discussion in Sec. 4.2). Nonetheless, a
numerical solution would be costly because the individual momentum modes would
have to be tracked and moreover, these modes couple among one another via the
backreaction of the doublet lepton asymmetries that aﬀect the helicity asymmetries
of the RH neutrinos.

Therefore, we derive from Eq. (69) a ﬂuid equation for the number densities of
the RH neutrinos by taking the zeroth moment over the momentum k. It can be
formulated in terms of the equilibrium number density

neq =

(cid:90) d3k

(2π)3 f eq =

and the deviations from equilibrium

δnhij =

(cid:90) d3k

(2π)3 δf0hij(k) .

(71)

(72)

Since the RH neutrinos are relativistic, rather than taking higher moments, a suit-
able procedure for going beyond the zeroth moment approximation would be to
solve the Boltzmann equations for a grid of momentum modes, making use of spa-
tial isotropy. For the reasons described above, phenomenological studies to this end
rely on the zeroth-moment approximation, and one should keep in mind that this
amounts to a theoretical uncertainty of order one.

22

In particular, this uncertainty is due to the fact that when integrating Eq. (69)
over d3k, dependencies on |k| do not only enter via δf0h and f eq but also through
HN , ΓN and ˜ΓN , such that extra factors of 1/|k| occur. These originate, e.g., from
the contributions

with the averaged rate γav ≡ Γav/T , which turns out to be dominated by the t-
channel exchange of charged leptons associated with gauge radiation. This rate has
been estimated or computed using a variety of methods in Refs. [20–22, 24, 25, 43–
49]. We emphasize that it is possible to derive this rate using CTP methods [22],
such that we can comply with the plan to remain with our derivations inside the
framework of the CTP formalism. In Ref. [50], the value γav = 0.012 is used, which
is based on the derivations of Refs. [21, 22].

For an electroweak crossover and a large degree of degeneracy in the eigenvalues
of the Majorana mass matrix MN , the evolution of the vacuum expectation value
v(z) of the Higgs ﬁeld may become relevant around electroweak temperatures. When
inserting the vacuum expectation values perturbatively and neglecting the small
admixture of doublet leptons to the sterile neutrinos for v(z) (cid:54)= 0, the Hermitian
part of the self-energy can be decomposed as follows

The result (76) corresponds to the ﬁnal box shown in Fig. 1 as well as the
momentum-averaged Eqs. (45) found in the operator-based approach.

Coming back to the order one inaccuracy in these equations, we note that it
is essentially due to the fact that the non-equilibrium distribution δf0h(k) of the
RH neutrinos is not known unless the momentum modes are tracked separately.
The remaining particles such as charged leptons, Higgs and gauge bosons that take
part in the relevant interactions are maintained in kinetic equilibrium by the gauge
interactions. Therefore their distributions are known and the momentum integrals
can be evaluated accurately. Regarding the RH neutrino distributions, the situation
in the ARS case is also diﬀerent from standard leptogenesis in the strong washout
regime because in the latter case, the momentum can be assumed to be much smaller
than the temperature due to the Maxwell suppression. The momentum integral over
these non-relativistic RH neutrinos can therefore be evaluated without incurring an
order one inaccuracy.

Leptonic charges Another decisive diﬀerence between strong washout and ARS
leptogenesis lies within the fact that in the former case, the Majorana mass of
the RH neutrinos close-to-maximally violates the chirality and hence the fermion
number, whereas for the relativistic RH neutrinos of the ARS case, this is a sub-
dominant eﬀect. Fermion number is therefore conserved to leading approximation,
and it is therefore useful to deﬁne the even and odd parts of the number densities

This charge is produced due to the backreaction from the asymmetry in doublet lep-
tons and in turn also appears as a source for the doublet asymmetry. Including also

5. Analytical expansions

The Eqs. (45) are challenging to treat numerically because they involve two or more
relevant time scales, in particular tosc(ij) and teq(α) that can be widely diﬀerent.
For this reason it is useful to have some analytical understanding on the expected
solutions. Several analytical approaches have been considered in the literature.
The most straightforward one is a perturbative expansion in the Yukawa couplings,
which is also a weak-washout expansion, since it implies that the equilibration
rates, O(λ2) (or teq(α)−1) are assumed small compared to any other scale in the
problem, in particular small compared to tosc(ij)−1 and to t−1
EW . This implies
that this approximation would fail for regions of parameter space where any ﬂavor
equilibrates before the EW phase transition teq(α) < tEW .

The results Eq. (84) and Eq. (85) are expressed for M1 < M2 < · · · . In Ref. [51],
it was estimated that in the case when one of the ﬂavors would be very far from
thermalization at TEW , while the others would have thermalized, a good approxi-
mation to the total baryon asymmetry should be the asymmetry in the slow ﬂavor

5.2. Perturbative expansion in mixings

In Ref. [34], an approximation that would allow to reach the equilibration regime
t (cid:39) teq(α) systematically was considered. It involves an expansion in the mixing
angles of the two unitary matrices that diagonalize the neutrino Yukawa coupling,
V, W . Since at least one state is not expected to reach equilibrium before tEW , we
assume is the third state and take y3 (cid:39) 0.

The kinetic equations could be solved analytically (neglecting the running of
the couplings and non-linear terms) also in the equilibration regime of the two fast
ﬂavors, 1, 2, and allowed the identiﬁcation of the ﬂavor and rephasing invariant
structures expected on general grounds, as explained in Sec. 3. This allowed to
clarify the relation between the original ARS result, which relies on a ﬂavor in-
variant that necessary involves three singlet families, and those found for example
in Ref. [29], which corresponds to a diﬀerent ﬂavor invariant that involves only
two singlet families. In the most general case, all these contributions are present
simultaneously.

For nR = 3, the result is of the form

Y∆B (cid:39) 3 · 10−3 (cid:88)

(90)

Note that only four invariants appear, because two phases are actually unphysical
if terms of O(M/T ) are neglected. Only the ﬁrst two invariants exist in the case
nR = 2. The functions Ai(t) are complicated functions of the Yukawas and the mass
diﬀerences (for the full expressions see [34]). Only in the weak washout regime the
dependence on the Yukawas is polynomial as in the estimates of the previous section.
On the other hand simpliﬁcations arise also in the strong washout regime for the
fast modes, y2
P t (cid:29) 1. In this limit, the leading dependence on the Yukawas is
O(y4) as opposed to O(y6).

5.3. The oscillatory and the overdamped regime

While it is a straightforward matter to solve the system of ﬂuid equations for the RH
neutrino number densities as well as for ∆α = B/3 − Lα, analytic approximations
give valuable insights, and they can prove useful in order to eﬃciently chart the vi-
able parameter space. We discuss two distinct regimes that rely on well-motivated
parametric conﬁgurations, and we refer to these as oscillatory and overdamped [38].
While the overdamped regime covers a part of the parameter space that is com-
plementary to the one addressed in Sec. 5.2, there is an overlap for the oscillatory
regime.

In order to qualify the dynamics that separates the two regimes, we note that

the ﬁrst oscillation among a pair of RH neutrinos i, j occurs at the time

zosc ≈ (cid:0)aR|M 2

j |(cid:1)−1/3
such that z3
N || = O(1), where ||·|| yields the modulus of the largest eigenvalue
of a matrix. This is to be compared with the damping rate at which the RH
neutrinos approach equilibrium, which corresponds to the time scale

(99)

In analogy with a mechanical system, zosc (cid:28) zeq corresponds to the oscillatory and
zeq (cid:28) zosc to the overdamped regime. Of course, in systems with more than two RH
neutrinos, there are in general several distinct oscillation frequencies and damping
rates, such that for the present discussion of analytic approximations, we mainly

28

conﬁne ourselves to the simple but relevant case of nR = 2 RH neutrinos. The
diﬀerent time-scales in the oscillatory and overdamped regimes are made visible
in Fig. 3, and we next explain the analytic approximations pertinent to these two
cases.

12 , the SM conserved
asymmetries ∆a, a = e, µ, τ and the baryon-to-entropy ratio Y∆B over z = Tref /T for Tref =
130 GeV. For the panel on the left, an exemplary parameter point in the oscillatory regime is
chosen, and on the right a point representing the overdamped regime.

5.3.1. Oscillatory regime

The dynamics of the oscillatory regime is exempliﬁed in the left panel of Fig. 3.
The approach for analytic approximations is ﬁrst to consider the evolution of the
RH neutrinos through the ﬁrst few oscillations while neglecting the backreaction
from the doublet lepton asymmetries. These early asymmetries can then rather
accurately be computed from a source term that depends on the phase oscillations
in the correlations of the diﬀerent mass eigenstates of the RH neutrinos.
In a
second step, at later times toward electroweak symmetry breaking, we consider the
redistribution of the leptonic charges that then induces in interplay with sphaleron
processes a net baryon asymmetry.c

Oscillations and creation of early asymmetries When the oscillations at
temperatures way above the electroweak scale are fast compared to the Hubble
rate (i.e. the mass-degeneracy is moderate at most), thermal corrections to the RH

cIf one of the active ﬂavors only couples very weakly to the RH neutrinos, washout of the pertaining
asymmetry can be avoided to a large extent. This leads to a variant of ARS that also works with
RH neutrinos above the electroweak scale [50].

It is further possible to show that up to order |λ†λ|, no sterile charges are produced
in the diagonal components of δnodd (for nR = 2 RH neutrino ﬂavors, this holds to
all orders), such that we can neglect the approximately conserved fermion number
in the RH neutrino sector to this end.

This asymmetry is yet purely ﬂavored such that it is crucial now to incorporate the
washout eﬀects that allow for a net baryon-to-entropy ratio Y∆B to emerge at late
times, cf. Fig. 3.

Washout and redistribution of leptonic charges By deﬁnition, washout be-
gins in earnest when z ∼ zeq, where the oﬀ diagonal correlations of the RH neutri-
nos have already decayed or they are oscillating so rapidly that their eﬀect averages
out. We can therefore neglect the source term for the asymmetry as well as the oﬀ-
diagonal RH neutrino correlations, such that the ﬂuid equations can at this stage
be approximated by

The baryon number density then takes the value

(113)

and Y∆B = B/s. The results discussed here agree up to the numerical prefactor
with what is derived in Sec. 5.2 with the result of Eq. (86) for the weak washout
regime. Since we do not rely here on the expansion in small mixing angles, the
result shown here is somewhat implicit because of the diagonalization (111), which
however is performed easily at little numerical cost.

5.3.2. Overdamped regime

The overdamped regime where zeq (cid:28) zosc requires a strong level of mass-degeneracy
among the RH neutrinos or large RH neutrino Yukawa couplings compared to the
smallest viable values in the seesaw parameter space.
In order to avoid strong
parametric tuning, one may appeal to lepton number as an approximately conserved
classical symmetry [52–55], where two of the RH neutrino states can be arranged to
form a pseudo-Dirac fermion. For nR = 2 RH neutrinos, the case for which we here
discuss the analytic approximations, the overdamped regime implies approximate
lepton number conservation.

A salient feature of approximate lepton number conservation is that one of the
interaction eigenstates of the RH neutrinos almost decouples. In the interaction
basis, where λ†λ is diagonal and

we can therefore neglect the smaller eigenvalue, i.e. the second one for deﬁniteness,
and drop all terms of O (cid:0)(λ†λ)22
(cid:1). In the interaction basis, the Hamiltonian due to
the vacuum mass matrix H vac

Here, we have suppressed the helicity index h, which we only show if necessary in
the following.

The key approximation that we apply now is one that is familiar from resonant
leptogenesis in the strong washout regime [6, 9, 56]. Due to the hierarchy in the RH
neutrino Yukawa couplings, the more strongly coupled RH neutrino N1 as well as its
ﬂavor correlations with N2 almost instantaneously reach the value that is implied
by the non-vanishing δn22. Thus, we neglect the derivative terms in Eqs. (117) and
solve these algebraically for δnij with i (cid:54)= j. These solutions are then substituted
back into Eq. (118) that then determines the time-dependent dynamics. This pro-
cedure is appropriate in particular if the rates implied on the right-hand side of
Eqs. (117) are larger than the Hubble rate. Somewhat tedious but straightforward
algebra thus leads to the CP-odd correlation

While in the oscillatory regime, the early oscillations of the oﬀ-diagonal correla-
tions of the RH neutrinos lead to a separation of the production from the washout
of SM charges, in the overdamped regime, both aspects have to be considered si-
multaneously because these are driven by the damping mediated through the RH
neutrino Yukawa couplings, cf. Fig. 3.

In the present setup, we assume that the processes mediated by the larger
Yukawa couplings λα1 are fast compared to the Hubble rate, i.e. N1 can be treated
as a fully equilibrated spectator. This modiﬁes the evolution of the SM conserved
charges [cf. Eq. (80)] to

We emphasize that because the overdamped regime allows for large active-sterile
mixing angles while being in agreement with the observed oscillation and mass-scales
of the light active neutrinos, it is of particular relevance in view of direct search
bounds for RH neutrinos that are available currently as well as in the intermediate
future. In particular, for the parametric conﬁgurations corresponding to the upper
bound on the active-sterile mixing that is shown in Fig. 6, ARS leptogenesis takes
place in the overdamped regime.

6. Numerical results

The parameter space on which these models can explain both the measured neutrino
masses and mixings, as well as the matter-antimatter asymmetry has been studied
in several works [27, 31–35, 38, 51, 57]. Particularly interesting is to know the range
of masses of the heavy neutrinos and their mixings to the charged leptons, since

34

both are measurable quantities, as well as the possible correlation of the matter-
antimatter asymmetry with the CP-violating phases in the neutrino mixing matrix,
or the amplitude of neutrinoless double-beta decay. We describe the results of two
recent scans of parameter space in the minimal model.

6.1. Bayesian analysis in the minimal model

a nested sampling algorithm implemented in the public package MultiNest [58,
59] and the Markov Chain sample analysis tool GetDist are used to get posterior
probabilities. At each point of the parameter space sampled the kinetic Eqs. (45) are
solved numerically using the software SQuIDS [60], designed to solve the evolution
of a generic density matrix in the interaction picture. For further details on the
numerical treatment of these equations we refer to Ref [27].

The scan is performed using the Casas-Ibarra parameters of Eq. (4). The light
neutrino masses and mixings are ﬁxed to the present best ﬁt points in the global
analysis of neutrino oscillation data of Ref. [61], for each of the neutrino orderings
(normal, NH, and inverted, IH), and the remaining free parameters are: the complex
angle of the R matrix, the CP phases of the PMNS matrix and the heavy Majorana
(cid:1),

Figures 4 and 5 show, for IH and NH, the posterior probabilities of the spectrum
of the two relevant states, M1, M2, the active-sterile mixings of the ﬁrst heavy state
|Uα4|2 (those of the second state are almost identical), the neutrinoless double beta
decay eﬀective mass |mββ| and the baryon asymmetry Y∆B. The two diﬀerent colors
(light blue and red) correspond to the two prior options for M2. The signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between the two posteriors show the eﬀect of allowing or not for ﬁne-
tuning in the degeneracy of the two heavy states. Even though the contours are
typically larger if more ﬁne-tuning is allowed, interesting solutions with a mild
degeneracy are found, which tend to correlate with smaller M1, M2, larger values
of the active-sterile mixing parameters and a sizable non-standard contribution
to neutrinoless double beta decay, which obviously imply much better chances of
testability. The chances of testability and the correlation with CP violation in
mixing will be discussed in more detail in the accompanying review article [62].

α = e, µ, τ . The blue and red contours correspond respectively to the assumption of a ﬂat prior
in log10 M1 and log10 M2 and to a ﬂat prior in log10 M1 and log10(∆MN 12). Plot taken from
Ref. [27].

6.2. Large-mixing solutions in the minimal model

Approximate lepton-number conservation [52–55] for nR = 2 RH neutrinos (as well
as for nR > 2 provided the additional RH states decouple) implies a strong mass
degeneracy among the pseudo-Dirac RH neutrino pair and allows for larger Yukawa
couplings and consequently for large active-sterile mixing. As it is explained in
Sec. 5.3.2, ARS leptogenesis then tends to take place in the overdamped regime, in
particular when the active-sterile mixing is close to the maximal presently allowed
level. The dynamics of this regime is illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 3.

In order to determine the upper bound on the active-sterile mixing, one can make
use of the insights from Sec. 5.3.2 into the analytic dependencies of the baryon asym-
metry on the input parameters as well as some general scaling arguments [38]. First,
the ﬂavored asymmetries are most eﬃciently turned into a net baryon asymmetry

Fig. 5. Triangle plot with 1D posterior probabilities and 2D 68% and 90% probability contours
in the nR = 2 scenario for NH. The parameters shown are the observables M1, ∆MN 12/M1 =
(M2 − M1)/M1, mββ , Y∆B, and the three mixings with the ﬁrst of the heavy states |Uα4|2 for
α = e, µ, τ . The blue and red contours correspond respectively to the assumption of a ﬂat prior
in log10 M1 and log10 M2 and to a ﬂat prior in log10 M1 and log10(∆MN 12). Plot taken from
Ref. [27].

provided one of the active ﬂavors (i.e. the one that mixes most strongly with the
lightest of the light neutrino mass eigenstates) couples as weakly as possible to the
RH states. This readily ﬁxes the remaining CP phases in the PMNS matrix that
are yet to be determined experimentally. (In turn, in the case of a discovery of RH
neutrinos with large active-sterile mixing, this leads to a particular opportunity of
testing ARS leptogenesis with nR = 2 sterile ﬂavors, see Ref. [57] and the pertain-
ing discussion in the accompanying paper [62]). Then, maximizing the CP-violating
source also ﬁxes the real part of the complex Casas-Ibarra angle. Finally, it can be
shown that a rescaling MN → ξMN and ∆M 2
N results in a change of the
ﬁnal baryon asymmetry B(z = 1) → B(z = η1/3)ξη−1/3. For a given point in pa-
rameter space, the mass splitting can thus be adjusted such that the time when the
baryon asymmetry reaches its maximum value coincides with sphaleron freeze-out.

Fig. 6. The viable range for ARS leptogenesis is shown between the blue lines for normal hierarchy
in the upper panel and for inverted hierarchy in the lower panel. Superimposed are exclusions from
past experiments and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) along with the theoretical lower bound on
the mixing from the seesaw mechanism. We assume nR = 2 RH neutrinos, ¯M is their average
mass, and U 2 = (cid:80)

i,α |Uαi|2 the total active-sterile mixing.

These analytic constraints make it practicable to identify the maximally possible
active-sterile mixings (for normal as well as inverted hierarchies) that are compared
with presently available experimental and cosmological constraints in Fig. 6. Note
that when comparing the results presented in this article, one should be aware that
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the most likely regions of the viable parameter space un-
der the assumption of the given priors while Fig. 6 shows the total range of viable
active-sterile mixing, what includes also points that have a small posterior likeli-
hood in the Bayesian analysis. These results are therefore partly complementary

and do not contradict one another.

6.3. The next-to-minimal model

The case with nR = 3 has been considered in Refs. [3, 34, 51] . It has been shown
that successful leptogenesis does not require mass degeneracies in this case, but also
the testability of the scenario will be much more challenging due to the enlarged
parameter space.

6.4. Remark on the reaction rates

While we have already commented on the agreement in the structure of the networks
of ﬂuid equations (45) and the one consisting of Eq. (76) and Eq. (80), we now also
compare the rates that enter the numerical solutions based on these two approaches.
By deﬁnition, the averaged rates (cid:104)γ(0)
N (cid:105) and γav are identical but slightly diﬀerent
numerical values have been substituted due to theoretical uncertainties. First, γav
used in Refs. [38, 57] is evaluated with coupling constants at the renormalization
scale 103 GeV, whereas (cid:104)γ(0)
N (cid:105) from Refs. [27] takes account of their running at
leading logarithmic order. Since the running of the SU(2) coupling, that dominates
these rates, is comparably weak however, this does not correspond to the leading
discrepancy. Rather, the evaluation of the logarithmically enhanced terms due to
soft lepton exchange in the t-channel for RH neutrino production associated with
gauge bosons requires a numerical evaluation of the scatterings mediated by the
one-loop resummed lepton propagator in the soft-momentum regime [22] or one
that is based on analytic approximations [20, 22, 24]. The value for γav based on
Ref. [22] therefore turns out to be about 30% larger than the value used for (cid:104)γ(0)
N (cid:105)
based on Refs. [20, 24].

Further, distinguishing between the averaged rates (cid:104)γ(0,1,2)

(cid:105) can lead to some
quantitative improvement when compared to using a single averaged rate. However,
the discrepancy incurred is within the range of the order one uncertainty due to the
the missing information on the RH neutrino distribution.

N

Finally, the rates αLC , αLC

W and αLV quoted in Sec. 7 include the opening of the
phase space due to thermal masses only, as assumed in Refs. [20, 63–65]. It has been
reported that this indeed is a suitable approximation for αLV [66]. Phenomenologi-
cal analyses should therefore include the dominant scattering contributions to αLC
and αLC

W as well (cf. Ref [66]).

7. The resonant regime: L-violating Higgs-decay leptogenesis

As discussed at length above, in the ARS regime the generation of the asymmetry
occurs at temperatures much higher than the Majorana masses MN i. Therefore, one
can deﬁne a total lepton number (or fermion number) L as the sum of the SM lepton
number and the helicity of the RH neutrinos, in such a way that this is typically

CP-violation.

treated as approximately conserved. However, as originally argued in [63], and later
conﬁrmed in the Raﬀelt-Sigl formalism in [64], leptogenesis can occur also via L-
violating Higgs decays, i.e. the decays of the Higgs doublet into a RH neutrino and
a SM lepton that do involve a Majorana mass insertion and violate L, analogously
to leptogenesis from N decays. This LNV eﬀect can become important, or even
dominant with respect to the LNC one discussed in detail in the previous sections,
in some regions of the parameter space in the resonant regime |MN i−MN j| ≪ MN i.
In Ref. [63] this phenomenon was studied in the (quantum) Boltzmann equations
formalism, with CP-violating rates accounting for the CP violation in the decays
φ ↔ ¯(cid:96)N . This process is depicted in Fig. 7. Naively, one would not expect any CP
violation in this decay: in order to be kinematically accessible, this decay requires
MN + M(cid:96) < Mφ; in turn, this implies that the propagators in the loop cannot go
on shell because of energy conservation, so that no (CP-violating) absorptive part
should be present. However, this argument holds true only at zero temperature.
Thermal eﬀects yield CP violation in this decay [67, 68] because the thermal bath
can provide the energy required to put on shell the propagators in the loop of Fig. 7.
Since also the other Sakharov conditions are fulﬁlled, as long as the RH neutrino in
the ﬁnal state is out of equilibrium, this process can therefore produce an asymmetry
in the early Universe. While this possibility to generate an asymmetry has been
known for quite some time [30, 32, 51, 67, 68], this phenomenon was typically
considered negligible for the generation of the baryon asymmetry at low scale and
N /T 2 suppression
therefore neglected, because the corresponding rates have a M 2
Instead, as argued recently
with respect to the LNC ones discussed in Sec. 4.2.
in [63, 64], at the level of the solution to the relevant Boltzmann or density-matrix
equations, the parametric dependence of the LNV contribution is diﬀerent from the
LNC one, so that the two phenomena dominate in diﬀerent regions of the parameter
space, as we are going to discuss now.

The LNV and LNC mechanisms can be described in the same framework by
means of density-matrix equations similar to the ones discussed in detail in Sec. 4.
The overall structure is similar to those, with the main novelty given by the presence
N /T 2 with respect
of L-violating terms, whose rates are suppressed by a factor M 2
to the L-conserving ones. The detailed form for the φ ↔ ¯(cid:96)N processes can be found

φ¯l¯lNNφ40

in [64] (see also [32]). These equations can be solved numerically (in practice if the
mass splitting is not too large), or even analytically, in some particular regimes. It
is instructive to consider the latter in the weak-washout expansion, limiting to the
ﬁrst non-zero order as in Eq. (85), where the washout for the LNC ARS mechanism
is treated at linear order.

Notice that, as already discussed in Sec. 3, the LNC contribution in this regime
is O(λ6). The reason is that at O(λ4) the asymmetry generated vanishes, when
summed over SM ﬂavors, since (cid:80)
= 0, so that in the LNC case an asym-
metric washout of the diﬀerent ﬂavors is necessary. This yields, in the linear regime,
an additional suppression factor (λλ†)αα (cf. also (25)). Equation (127) depends on

Notice that this is nonzero when summed over ﬂavors, so that at leading order in the
weak-washout expansion no washout is involved. This implies that the L-violating
contribution Eq. (130) in this regime is O(λ4), diﬀerently from the LNC one. Notice
that in the weak-washout regime the two contributions are additive and, since the
parametric dependence of Eq. (127) and Eq. (130) is diﬀerent, they dominate in
diﬀerent regimes. In particular, for M ∼ 1 GeV, in the weak-washout regime the

the Y∆B asymmetry obtained. The observed value, Y∆B (cid:39) 0.86 × 10−10 is denoted by the dashed
line. In the right panel, we plot the ratio of the full LNC + LNV result to the LNC ARS one
only. Exclusion limits and future prospects from various experiments are also shown. For further
details, see [64].

To study the relative importance of the two phenomena beyond the linear weak-
washout regime, one can solve numerically the relevant density matrix equations.
The numerical results for an illustrative choice of parameters are given in Fig. 8,
with |MN 1 −MN 2|/MN 1 = 10−10. On the left panel we show the region of successful
leptogenesis, as given by the full density-matrix equations, which take into account
both the LNC and LNV phenomena. On the right panel we show the ratio of the
full result with the one obtained artiﬁcially switching oﬀ the L-violating eﬀects.
In the light gray region the L-violating eﬀects are small, and the “standard” LNC
ARS phenomenon dominates. Instead, for small values of the imaginary part γ of
the Casas-Ibarra angle, i.e. for values of the Yukawa couplings that do not require
large cancellations in the seesaw relation, the two phenomena have comparable size
(with the LNV one typically dominating for small mass splitting as in Fig. 8), as
already discussed above at the level of the weak-washout analytic solutions, which
are valid in this regime.

In addition, for large values of γ, the LNV contribution becomes generically dom-
inant, even by many orders of magnitude with respect to the LNC one [64]. The
origin of this is clear: for large γ we are in the strong washout regime. In this regime,
the L-conserving washout processes will eﬀectively wash out the LNC part of the
asymmetry, whereas the LNV washout part, which is suppressed by an extra M 2
N /T 2
factor, will wash out less the asymmetry in the total lepton number L (and only at
later times due to this factor), resulting in a dominant L-violating part. This dom-
inance occurs generically for Yukawa couplings large enough, even for larger mass

the region in which this occurs corresponds to successful leptogenesis.

We conclude this section by commenting on the dependence on the initial “re-
heating” temperature Tin, where the RH neutrino population is assumed to vanish.
As argued in [63], the L-violating Higgs-decay mechanism is a low-scale one, in
the sense that the asymmetry is generated mainly at temperatures close to the
sphaleron decoupling one Tc. The LNC ﬂavored asymmetries, instead, are mainly
produced at Tosc ≈ (M ∗
N )1/3 (at least in the weak-washout regime), which
easily lies well above Tc, in which case the latter is sensitive to physics at scales
much higher than the electroweak one.

P ∆M 2

The discussion in this section takes into account exclusively the baryon asym-
metry produced by φ ↔ ¯(cid:96)N processes. As discussed in Sec. 4.2, a number of other
processes are fully relevant, in particular the top-quark and gauge scattering and
the IR-enhanced gauge corrections to Higgs decay. These processes will generate a
baryon asymmetry in a similar way because they involve as a subprocess the same
φ ↔ ¯(cid:96)N transition. One could therefore anticipate that, including them, the L-
violating rates will be enhanced by a factor of few similarly to the L-conserving
ones. A fully quantitative calculation of the baryon asymmetry, with a proper in-
clusion of all these relevant L-conserving and L-violating processes, may therefore
modify the numbers given above, but is not expected to change qualitatively the
picture.

8. Conclusions

In this Chapter, we have reviewed the basic mechanism of ARS leptogenesis and
beyond that, have put particular emphasis on the following developments that have
taken place during the recent years:

• A variety of diﬀerent parametric regimes and source terms for the ARS
In addition to
scenario that lead to viable leptogenesis has been found.
the the original ARS source term, the weak washout, strong washout and
overdamped regimes have been identiﬁed and predictions have been made
using numerical as well as analytical methods presented in Sec. 5. In cate-
gorizing these, weak basis invariants of the neutrino sector have proved to
be valuable, see Sec. 3.

• There has been an advancement of theoretical computations, both in reﬁn-
ing the operator formalism as well as in formulating and solving the mech-
anism in the CTP framework. It has been understood which the relevant
scattering rates for the RH neutrinos are, and state-of-the art computations
of these have been included, see Sec. 4.

• Along with the development of these techniques, more accurate and com-
prehensive surveys of the parameter space have been performed, both from
a Bayesian perspective as well as by ﬁnding the upper limits of the active-

43

sterile mixing imposed by neutrino phenomenology in conjunction with vi-
able leptogenesis, see Sec. 6.

• Lepton-number violating eﬀects have been included and the regions of pa-
rameter space where these are relevant have been identiﬁed, as discussed in
Sec. 7.

ARS leptogenesis is a plausible scenario for baryogenesis that will either be fur-
ther constrained or even receive support by new experimental results in the foresee-
able future, see the accompanying article [62] for more details on phenomenological
aspects. Therefore, it is timely to implement more methodical reﬁnements. Most
importantly, uncertainties due to the momentum-averaging of the RH neutrinos
should be removed, LNV eﬀects in the source and the washout terms should be
included for all relevant processes, and also the dependence of the rates through the
electroweak crossover ought to be accounted for.

Finally, we emphasize that the numerical examples and some of the ana-
lytical methods discussed here are for the case of the SM supplemented with
nR = 2 RH neutrinos, for deﬁniteness as well as simplicity. The obvious relax-
ation nR = 3 of this assumption is known to lead to a largely increased viable
parameter space [34, 51], and it will therefore be interesting to investigate ARS lep-
togenesis in embeddings of the seesaw mechanism in scenarios beyond the Standard
Model.
