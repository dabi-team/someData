Abstract

We propose to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) using a dual-phase liquid
argon time projection chamber (TPC) with 200 kg ﬁducial mass. The detector is expected to be adjacent
to the JUNO-TAO experiment and to be about 35 m from a reactor core with 4.6 GW thermal power at
Taishan. The antineutrino ﬂux is approximately 6×1012 cm−1s−1 at this location, leading to more than 11,000
coherent scattering events per day in the ﬁducial mass. However, the nuclear recoil energies concentrate in
the sub-keV region, corresponding to less than ten ionization electrons in the liquid argon. The detection of
several ionization electrons can be achieved in the dual-phase TPC due to the large ampliﬁcation in the gas
region. With a feasible detection threshold of four ionization electrons, the signal rate is 955 per day. The
detector is designed to be shielded well from cosmogenic backgrounds and ambient radioactivities to reach a
16% background-to-signal ratio in the energy region of interest. With the large CEνNS sample, the expected
sensitivity of measuring the weak mixing angle sin2 θW , and of limiting the neutrino magnetic moment are
discussed. In addition, a synergy between the reactor antineutrino CEνNS experiment and the dark matter
experiment is foreseen.

Introduction

There has been over forty years since D. Freedman predicted the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
process (CEνNS) [1]. In the weak neutral current, the ν + A → ν + A elastic scattering process should have
a sharp coherent forward peak for qR (cid:28) 1. Here, q is the absolute momentum transfer from the neutrino
to the nucleus, and R is the weak nuclear radius. The CEνNS is dominated interaction for neutrinos with
energies less than ∼100 MeV. It has been ﬁrstly observed at a 6.7σ conﬁdence level with a CsI[Na] detector in
the COHERENT experiment [2]. It used pulsed neutrinos from the Spallation Neutrino Source (SNS). Later
on, the ν-Ar coherent scattering is also detected by the COHERENT experiment using a single phase liquid
argon detector [3]. Since the neutrinos are produced in the pion-decay-at-rest process, the nuclei recoil energy
concentrates in a range of several to tens of keV (keVnr).

Given the high cross section and the unique properties of the CEνNS process, many studies have been carried
out using the COHERENT data. For example, the weak mixing angle is measured at the low momentum
transfer [4]. The average CsI neutron density distribution is obtained [5]. When endowed with mass and
electromagnetic properties, the neutrino magnetic moment µν [6] and the neutrino charge radius [7] are limited.
On the other hand, via the CEνNS process, astrophysical neutrinos create an unavoidable background in the

experiments searching for the WIMP dark matter [8–10], that is the ’neutrino ﬂoor’. In addition, the search for
low-mass WIMP using the ionization signal only has drawn more and more attention [11–13]. Understanding
the response of LXe and LAr from sub-keV to several keV nuclear recoil energies is crucial to the search for
light dark matter via this approach.

Given such abundant physics topics, many experiments are on projecting or proceeding [14]. Larger
detectors with lower detection threshold will be employed in the COHERENT experiment [15]. On the other
hand, experiments using the strongest artiﬁcial neutrino source on the Earth, i.e., the nuclear reactors, are
growing quickly, such as CONNIE [16], MINER [17], CONUS [18], and Red-100 [19]. Compared to the neutrinos
with energies of a few tens MeV at SNS, the 2 MeV average energy of reactor antineutrinos requires a signiﬁcant
reduction of the detection threshold. Thus, the corresponding detectors used in the above experiments are the
cryogenic Ge/Si detector, or the dual-phase Xe Time Projection Chamber (TPC).

In this paper, we propose an experiment to measure the coherent scattering between reactor νe’s and
argon nuclei using a dual-phase argon TPC at Taishan, referred to as Taishan Coherent Scattering Experiment
here after. The Taishan Coherent Scattering Experiment will use 200 kg argon as target and will be located
side-by-side with the JUNO-TAO experiment [20], which aims to precisely measure the reactor νe spectrum
using a ton-scale liquid scintillator detector with a percent level energy resolution. The antineutrino ﬂux
is approximately 6×1012 cm−1s−1 at this location, and the vertical overburden is about 5 meters of water
equivalent (m.w.e.) [20]. The TPC size is limited primarily by the size of the elevator to enter the lab. Thus,
the maximum ﬁducial argon mass is 200 kg.

There are many advantages of using argon in the detection of CEνNS. As a noble element detector, the
target mass is easy to reach hundreds of kilograms. This leads to much larger statistics compared to the kg-scale
Ge/Si detectors. Although the ν−Xe CEνNS cross section is about 16 times larger than that of ν−Ar, due to
the mass of an argon nucleus is approximately 3.4 times smaller than xenon, the larger nuclear recoil energy
leads to much easier detection in argon. The large CEνNS sample not only allows to measure the weak mixing
angle sin θW using the reaction rate, but also opens a door to explore more physics using the spectral shape,
for example, constraining the neutrino magnetic momentum, and measuring the ionization electron yield at
keVnr energy range. The major problem of using argon is the intrinsic 1 Bq/kg 39Ar decays in the atmospheric
argon (AAr). A possible solution is to use the depleted underground argon (UAr) [21]. As a feasibility study,
we will use a 0.7 mBq/kg 39Ar decay rate in the following sections.

The paper is structured as follows: Sec. 2 presents the conceptual design of the low threshold Argon TPC
detector. Sec. 3 focuses on the background simulation and the design of shielding. Sec. 4 presents the study of
expected sensitivities. A short summary and prospects are discussed in Sec. 5.

where Eν is the energy of the neutrino, GF is the Fermi constant, M is the nucleus mass, and TN is the nuclear
recoil energy. The weak charge QW is deﬁned as:

QW = N − (1 − 4 × sin θW ) · Z,

(2)

where N and Z are the numbers of neutrons and protons in the nucleus, and θW is the Weinberg mixing angle.
The weak form factor F 2
W (q2) is taken as 1 due to the low q values in the scattering between reactor νe’s and
nuclei [22].

Using the reactor neutrino spectra in the 2-8 MeV range provided in Refs. [23, 24] and applying an
exponential extrapolation for spectra below 2 MeV, the nuclear recoil energy spectra of Ar are calculated
and shown in Fig. 1. The νe-Ar CEνNS reactions from neutrinos in sliced energy ranges (0-1 MeV; 1-1.8 MeV;
1.8-3 MeV; 3-10 MeV) are also drawn for better illustration. The detection of reactor νe’s with energies smaller
than 1.8 MeV, i.e., below the threshold of the inverse-beta-decay reaction, is quite diﬃcult. Because the nuclear

recoil energy is less than 0.15 keVnr where the electron yield is about 6.4 e−/keVnr , corresponding to a single
ionization electron. In the energy region above 0.2 keVnr, the signals are dominated by νe’s with energies larger
than 3 MeV. This puts a stringent requirement on lowering the detection threshold to sub-keVnr.

The dual-phase TPC using argon or xenon suits such low energy detection. An obvious advantage of argon
is the smaller nucleus mass than xenon. The signal rate on argon is larger than that on xenon with the same
target mass when the recoil energy is larger than 0.17 keVnr. To estimate a feasible detection threshold, we
take the experience from the DarkSide-50 and the Red-100 experiments. The DarkSide-50 dual-phase argon
TPC has achieved the detection of single ionization electron and the analysis of energy threshold above 4
ionization electrons. The latter value corresponds to approximately 0.5 keVnr [11]. The Red-100 experiment
has performed the ﬁrst ground-level laboratory test of the dual-phase xenon TPC and proved the feasibility
of a threshold of 4 ionization electrons (about 0.6 keVnr in xenon) [19, 25, 26]. Thus, we will use 4 ionization
electrons (about 0.5 keVnr in argon) as the analysis threshold in the following studies.

The proposed Taishan Coherent Scattering Experiment will be located side-by-side with the JUNO-TAO
experiment in the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant. There are two reactor cores in operation now. Each of them
has a thermal power of 4.6 GW. The experiment will be in a basement of an elevation of –9.6 meters, in which
the measured cosmic-ray muon ﬂux is one third of that at the ground level. The argon TPC is approximately
35 m to one reactor core and is 253 m to another one. The entrance to the laboratory relies on an elevator
with a width of 1.39 m and a height of 1.99 m. Thus, the size of TPC together with the outer shielding and
insulation materials is limited to 1.4 m and the total ﬁducial mass is about 200 kg. In addition, the height of
the detector, including the shield, should be less than 3.85 m due to the limitation of experimental hall space.
Figure 2 shows the conceptual design of the dual-phase argon TPC detector. The most inner region is the
sensitive argon target (SensAr). A cylindrical acrylic vessel (57 cm height, 57 cm diameter) is used to hold
∼ 200 kg liquid argon. A drift electric ﬁeld is applied in the vertical direction by the high votage on the copper
rings. A gas argon layer with a height of 1.5 cm is above the liquid argon. A luminescent electric ﬁeld is applied
in the gas region for the single ionization electron detection. The energy deposition in liquid argon produces
photons and free electrons. The photons are promptly detected by photosensors and are commonly named as
S1. The free electrons will drift to the gas layer in the vertical electric ﬁeld. Then, one electron could generate
an electroluminescence signal named as S2. The S2 photoelectron (p.e.) yield can reach 23±1 p.e./e− [11]. The

point to the gas phase. The electron drift speed is related to the strength of the drift electric ﬁeld [27]. In the
reactor νe-Ar CEνNS reaction, it is great diﬃculty to detect S1. For the argon detector, the better light yield
is about 10 PE/keVee for S1. So the S1 is few and even zero PE in the sub − keVnr considering the quenching
factor. Thus, the experiment would rely on S2 only. A set of photosensor array is equipped on the top and
the bottom of the TPC. The photon sensitive coverage is 30% similar to that of DarkSide-50. To simulate the
background, 44*2 Hamamatsu R-11065 PMTs are used as the photon sensor array.

great importance to tag the multiple scattering γ’s and neutrons.

3 Veto and shielding design

Although the number of CEνNS signals could reach 1,000 per day in the 200 kg argon target above a detection
threshold of 4 ionization electrons, the signals could be easily washed out by the backgrounds from cosmic
ray muons (about 60 Hz/m2) and ambient radioactivity decays. To design the veto and shielding, lots of
simulation are carried out using Geant4 [28]. The ambient radioactivity and cosmic ray muons are simulated.
The concentrations of 238U, 232Th, and 40K in the materials are listed in Table 1. The muon generators are
taken from the JUNO-TAO simulation [20]. The veto and shielding design is shown in Fig. 3.

layer stands for 15 cm lead to shield the ambient radioactivity from hall. Then, a polypropylene layer acts as
thermal insulation and also can shield neutrons generated by muons. With 90 cm polypropylene, the acrylic
vessel can keep -186 oC stably.

There are two liquid argon detectors, the outer liquid argon detector is served as a veto detector,
instrumented with photosensors and named as the VetoAr, and the inner detector is the aforementioned dual-
phase liquid argon TPC, used to detect νe’s and named as the SensAr. The VetoAr not only passively shields
the SensAr from radioactivity from outer materials or hall concrete, but also can tag the multiple scattering
γs or neutrons. Once the VetoAr observes an energy deposit, a 600 µs veto window could be applied to the
SensAr according to the maximum drift time of electrons from the TPC bottom to the top. Since most of
backgrounds are from gammas, a quenching factor of 0.25 [29] is used to convert the nuclear recoil energy and
the electron energy, that is, 1 keVee = 4 keVnr. In the following sections, the backgrounds are provided in the
energy range of 0 to 1 keVee, corresponding to 0 to 4 keVnr.

Figure 3: Conceptional design of veto and shielding of the Taishan Coherent Scattering Experiment.

3.1 Natural radioactivity

3.1.1 Backgrounds from the hall

In the simulation of the natural radioactive decays in the concrete of the hall, the simulation generators
including the γ/α/e− from radioactive decay are placed in the shell extending 30 cm into the inner wall.
According to simulation results, the gamma rays beyond the 30 cm are almost impossible to transport into the
sensitive argon. Figure 4 shows the energy spectrum in the SensAr after shielded by 15 cm lead and other inner
materials. The background level is about 0.22 /day/kg/keVee in the 0 to 1 keVee energy region. Considering
the 101 t weight of the 15 cm lead, diﬀerent thicknesses of lead are also simulated, listed in Table 2. It can be
found that the 15 cm lead is diﬃcult to reduce.

In addition to the gammas,

fast neutrons could be produced via the (α, n) reaction and in the
238U spontaneous ﬁssion, named as radiogenic neutrons. The neutron ﬂux from Hall
is estimated as
2.0 × 10−6 /cm2/s [30], and the average neutron kinetic energy is about 1.7 MeV. The attenuation length
of neutron is about 6.8 cm in the material that contains 10% hydrogen. After about 90 cm polypropylene, the
neutron ﬂux could be reduced by 106. Thus, the radiogenic neutron contributes only a few background per day

that can be ignored.

3.1.2 Backgrounds from the detector material

The background contributions in the SensAr from major detector components are listed in Table 3. If the energy
deposit in the VetoAr is larger than 0.1 MeV, this event triggers the veto argon detector, and a subsequent 600 µs
veto window is applied in the sensitive detector. Here list the statistics of radioactivity counts (Edep > 0.1 keV)
and also list the count of the energy interval (0.1 keV < Edep < 1 keV). The radioactivity from material could
be vetoed by veto argon detector. The threshold in the veto detector is also varied, and the corresponding veto
eﬃciency is shown in Fig. 5. The diﬀerent color mean diﬀerent material. For higher veto eﬃciency and lower
trigger, an energy threshold of 0.1 MeV is recommended. The ”Edep” is the energy deposit in the sensitive
argon. The total trigger rate will be about 2 Hz in the sensitive detector. With the help of the VetoAr, the
background in the energy range of interest is only 18 per day in SensAr, much smaller than the 1,000 signals.

Another crucial background comes from the intrinsic 39Ar and 85Kr decays in the argon. It is well known
that the 39Ar concentrations in the argon from atmosphere (AAr) or underground (UAr) are quite diﬀerent as
shown in Table 4 [21, 31]. If the AAr is used in the SensAr, the number of 39Ar decays in the energy of interest
could reach 40 times of the signal. Thus, UAr is a must for the detection of CEνNS using reactor νe’s. In
this case, the background rate is 25 per day per 200 kg in the energy range of interest. If the AAr is used in
VetoAr, the dead time could reach more than 50%.

As a short summary, the energy spectra of backgrounds from materials are shown in Fig. 6. The residual
backgrounds are dominated by the intrinsic 39Ar and 85Kr decays. A lower 85Kr concentrations could be
achieved using the distillation at low temperature.

3.2 Cosmic ray muons

Although most of the hadronic components of cosmic rays have been absorbed, the muons with a rate of
∼60 Hz/m2 in the experimental hall would contribute signiﬁcant backgrounds if they are not well tagged.
In the conceptual design, two detectors are employed to tag the muons. The ﬁrst one is a layer of plastic
scintillator with 5 cm thickness as the outmost tag. The VetoAr detector is used to tag muons close to the
sensitive argon TPC as Fig. 3. Table 5 summarizes the rates and veto eﬃciency of muons and secondary
particles in diﬀerent detectors. Figure 7 shows the time interval distribution between the energy deposit in
SensAr and the corresponding muon. Black line shows the all events in SensAr; blue line shows the residual
events after the veto of plastic scintillator; red line shows the residual events after the vetof of VetoAr. For
illustration, the time interval longer than 30 µs is ﬁlled in the bin of 29 µs. There are two typical cases to
discuss.

I. Muons passing through or stopped in the SensAr or VetoAr. Once a large energy deposit is found in the
two detectors, a subsequent 600 µs veto window is applied in the SensAr. Neutrons or radioactive nuclei could
be produced in the interaction of cosmic ray muon and detector materials, such as radioisotopes of S/Cl/Ar/K.
The energetic particles generated in the neutron capture and the nuclei decays form the long tail in the time
interval distribution. The 600 µs veto window removes most of neutrons and muon decay signals. The events
with longer life are diﬃcult to be vetoed. The VetoAr could reduce signiﬁcantly such background because a γ
from the decay of cosmogenic isotopes could deposit energy both in the VetoAr and SenAr detectors, shown as
the red line in Fig. 7.

II. For muons only passing through the plastic scintillator detector, the plastic scintillator could tag them
with a very high eﬃciency. Due to the 3400 Hz trigger rate of the plastic scintillator detector, the subsequent
correlation time window with the argon detectors could set only to 1 to 10 µs. It could help to classify the
events in the argon detectors, as cosmic ray muons contribute the largest trigger rate in the argon detectors,
as listed in Table 6.

3.3 Summary of background rates and the detector live time

Table 6 lists the summary of background rates and dead time. The veto time window is 600 µs in SensAr once
the VetoAr observes an energy deposit larger than 0.1 MeV. This design signiﬁcantly reduces the background
in the SensAr. A 10µs correlation window will be used between the argon detectors and the plastic scintillator

UAr in the VetoAr is not necessary, but it can save the 42% dead time as the value in the brankets. Moreover,
the low trigger rate in VetoAr by using underground argon can help set up an online anti-coincidence to
reduce the amount of data. After shielding and veto, the background level is about 1.424 event/kg/keV/day
in 0.1-1 keVee.

Expected sensitivity of the Taishan Coherent Scattering Experiment

With the ∼1,000 CEνNS signals per day of the Taishan Coherent Scattering Experiment above the 0.5 keVnr
threshold, many physics topics can be studied, for example, the weak mixing angle at low momentum transfer
and the neutrino magnetic moment, etc. Moreover, the reactor νe’s, with 2%∼3% spectrum shape precision
measured in Ref. [32], provide a powerful tool to study the ionization electron yield at keVnr energy range.
This will beneﬁt the search of low-mass WIMP dark matter, in particular for the analyses using the ionization
signal only [11, 33]. A synergy between the neutrino detector and the dark matter detector is foreseen. Some
discussions are presented in this section.

To perform these analyses, a simpliﬁed detector response is added to the signal and background spectra.
The ﬁrst step is to convert the nuclear recoil energy and the electron energy to the number of ionization
electrons (Ne−). The ionization electron yield (Ye−) refers to the results in Ref. [11]. As mentioned above,
a quenching factor of 0.25 is used between keVee and keVnr. The Ne− distribution is assumed to follow the
Poisson distribution. The electron extraction eﬃciency is set to 100%. Figure 8 shows the CEνNS signal and
background spectra in the unit of ionization electrons. To get a good signal to background ratio, the energy
region of interest is selected to 4 to 11 e−. The 4 e− is chosen to get rid of the backgrounds released by
impurities after a large energy deposit. In the 4 to 11 e− energy range, the number of signals and background
events is 955 and 153, respectively, per day per 200 kg argon.

In the future, the background can be measured in-situ using the reactor on-oﬀ information. According to
the reactor running status, there would be an one-month reactor oﬀ period per year. The background can be

of σbkg = 1/(cid:112)Nbkg/Nbin = 4.2% per ionization electron bin. This number will be used in the following
analyses.

The systematic uncertainties consist of the trigger eﬃciency, the target mass, and the reactor νe rate and
spectrum. According to Ref. [11], the trigger eﬃciency has reached to 100% at 4 ionization electrons. Since all
the sensitive argon is hold in the acrylic vessel, no ﬁducial volume cut is used, the target mass uncertainty only
arises from the liquid level instability. The νe prediction will beneﬁt from the reactor neutrino experiments using
the IBD channel [20, 32, 34, 35]. Thus, 1% (aggressive) and 3% (conservative, nominal) bin-to-bin correlated
uncertainties will be tested.

Spectra of CEνNS signals and simulated background, taken a simpliﬁed detector response into

The measured CEνNS spectrum in terms of the number of ionization electrons is sensitive to several
parameters. Here, we take the weak mixing angle sin2 θW , the neutrino magnetic moment νµ, and the ionization
electron yield Ye− for illustration. The nominal value of sin2 θW is set to 0.2386 according to the Particle Data
Group [36], νµ is set to 0, and Ye− to 7 per keVnr. Then, three spectra are generated by changing one parameter
and keeping the other two unchanged. Their ratios to the nominal spectrum are shown in Fig. 9. The weak
mixing angle sin2 θW changes the number of events in all the bins by the same ratio. An obvious upward trend
is found when Ye− is enlarged by 10%. It means the Ye− can be extracted by ﬁtting the measured spectrum
shape with the high statistics data. This provides a unique probe to calibrate the ionization electron yield in
sub-keVnr energy range, in which there is no suitable neutron source up to now. Finally, if a non-zero νµ value
is introduced, a downward trend is found, since the CEνNS cross section will be plus the term:

using the reactor oﬀ data as mentioned above. Thus, the 4.6% background uncertainty is treated as bin-to-bin
uncorrelated as βi in the denominator. The nuisance parameter α stands for the systematic uncertainty, and
3% is used conservatively as the nominal value. The results with 1% systematic uncertainty are also shown in
the plots.

By minimizing the χ2 function, the expected sensitivities of sin2 θW and µν are obtained and shown in
Fig. 10. The 90% C.L. of sin2 θW is 0.232 to 0.246 at keV energy transfer. The upper limit of the neutrino
magnetic moment is µν/µB <6.6 × 10−11. As a comparison, the best measurement of sin2 θW at low energy
transfer is the atomic parity violation (APV) experiment, 0.238 ± 0.005 (1σ) [37]. From the COHERENT
experiment, the value of sin2 θW is 0.26+0.04
−0.03(1σ) [38]. The best limit for µν is µν <2.9 × 10−11µB measured by
GEMMA [39].

For example, µν is ﬁxed to 0 when studying sin2 θW . Similarly, sin2 θW is ﬁxed at the nominal value when
searching for the upper limit of µν. In the future, a joint ﬁtting of sin2 θW , µν, and Ye− can be performed
based on the large CEνNS data set.

5 Summary

In this paper, we have put forward a 200 kg dual-phase argon time projection chamber to detect the CEνNS
from the Taishan nuclear reactor. The outer shielding and the active veto are designed. The backgrounds from
ambient radioactivity and cosmic-ray muons are simulated. With the help of a single-phase argon detector
surrounding the dual-phase TPC, the background level is 153 per day in the energy range of interest. This
compares to a CEνNS signal rate of 955 per day. With the large data set, the expected sensitivities of the
weak mixing angle sin2 θW , the neutrino magnetic moment νµ are presented. In addition, a synergy between
the reactor antineutrino CEνNS experiment and the WIMP dark matter experiment is foreseen, not only in
the better understanding of the neutrino ﬂoor, but also in the understanding of the detector response at keV
nuclear recoil energy range.
