Abstract— Despite the existence of different error metrics for
trajectory evaluation in SLAM, their theoretical justiﬁcations
and connections are rarely studied, and few methods handle
temporal association properly. In this work, we propose to
formulate the trajectory evaluation problem in a probabilistic,
continuous-time framework. By modeling the groundtruth as
random variables, the concepts of absolute and relative error
are generalized to be likelihood. Moreover, the groundtruth is
represented as a piecewise Gaussian Process in continuous-time.
Within this framework, we are able to establish theoretical
connections between relative and absolute error metrics and
handle temporal association in a principled manner.

I. INTRODUCTION

Visual(-inertial) odometry (VO/VIO) and simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM) are important building
blocks in robotic systems, as they provide accurate state
estimate for other tasks, such as control and planning. To
benchmark such algorithms, the most used method is to
evaluate the estimated trajectory (i.e.,
timestamped pose
series) with respect to the groundtruth.

The central task for trajectory evaluation is to summa-
rize certain metrics from the estimate and the groundtruth
to indicate the performance. There are many established
evaluation methods, most notably the absolute trajectory
error (ATE) [1] and the relative error (RE) [2]. While these
methods are widely used in practice and can be indicative
of the performance, there are still many open problems.
Speciﬁcally, in this paper, we are interested in the following:
1) It is well known that different metrics reﬂect different
properties of estimate [3]. However,
the connection
between them is not clear. Indeed, it is observed in
practice that relative and absolute errors are often highly
correlated (e.g., [1]), but no theoretical proof has been
proposed before.

2) Almost all the existing methods assume perfect tempo-
ral correspondences or adopt a naive matching strategy.
For example,
to ﬁnd the corresponding groundtruth
of the estimate at time t, most tools simply use the
closest groundtruth, which is only acceptable when the
groundtruth is of sufﬁciently high temporal resolution.
There is no principled method currently to take into
consideration of the imperfect
temporal association,
which can in practice have an impact for low rate
groundtruth providers or missing data.

In this work, we proposes to formulate the trajectory
evaluation in a probabilistic, continuous-time framework.
First, instead of considering the groundtruth as deterministic
values, we model it as random variables and thus generalize
the concepts of absolute and relative error as likelihood.
While this step seems trivial (e.g., sum of squared error
is simply the likelihood from Gaussian uncertainties), this
allows us to draw connection between relative and abso-
lute error (Section III). Second, to reason about temporal
association in a principled manner, we propose to use
Gaussian Process (GP) to represent the groundtruth. As a
probabilistic and continuous-time representation, GP reports
uncertainty for any query time, which, for example, gives
higher uncertainties for query times far away from the actual
groundtruth samples. In this way, the effect of imperfect
temporal association can be handled elegantly, which is not
possible with many other continuous-time representations,
such as polynomials.

It

is well known that

the trajectory evaluation prob-
lem is mainly complicated by the unobservable degrees-of-
freedoms (DoFs) in the estimator [3], and thus is speciﬁc to
different sensing modalities. For simplicity, throughout the
paper, we present the framework for trajectory estimates with
unknown rigid-body transformations (e.g., stereo or RGB-
D sensors). However, our method can be adapted to other
interesting setups (monocular, visual-inertial) in future work.

A. Contributions and Outline

The contributions of this work are:
• we provide the ﬁrst theoretical proof that draws con-

nection between relative and absolute error.

• the proposed probabilistic, continuous-time framework
is the ﬁrst that is able to handle temporal association
properly.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section II,
we formulate the evaluation problem of interest and introduce
essential notations. In Section III, the generalized versions
of RE and ATE are derived with the probabilistic modeling
of the groundtruth, and the connection between them are
presented. In Section IV, we show how to represent the
groundtruth as a Gaussian process on SE(3). Finally, we
conclude the paper and discuss future work in Section V.

II. THE TRAJECTORY EVALUATION PROBLEM

Informatics, University of Zurich , and Dep. of Neuroinformatics, University
of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Switzerland— http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch.

In this work, we are interested in evaluating the estimate
consisting of 6 DoF poses, which is mostly common for

 
 
 
 
 
 
VO/VIO/SLAM setups. We parameterize a 6 DoF pose as an
element (a 4 × 4 matrix) in matrix Lie group SE(3), denoted
as T. As for the subscripts, Ta,b denotes the pose of frame b
with respect to frame a (expressed in frame a).

To express the uncertainty associated with T, we adopt
the method in [4] to deﬁne distributions directly on the
corresponding lie algebra se(3). Basically, to represent a
stochastic pose T(cid:48), we use a deterministic pose T and a
random variable ξξξ ∈ R6. The stochastic pose is then

T(cid:48) = T exp(ξξξ∧) (cid:44) T Exp(ξξξ),

where exp(·) is the exponential map of SE(3). For a Gaus-
sian distribution ξξξ ∼ N (0, Σ), we can write T(cid:48) ∼ NT(cid:48)(T, Σ).
We will also heavily use the adjoint in SE(3), denoted as
AdT (a 6 × 6 matrix), and some useful identities that will be
used are:

T Exp(ξξξ) = Exp(AdTξξξ)T,
det |AdT| = 1,
AdT1 AdT2 = AdT1T2,

(2)

(3)

(4)

and (4) also entails (AdT)−1 = AdT−1 by setting T1 = T−1
2 .

B. Estimate, Groundtruth and Evaluation

Technically speaking, a trajectory is a continuous function
that maps from time to the state of interest (e.g., 6 DoF
pose, velocity). In practice, we usually only have access to
a limited number of samples from this continuous function.
Therefore, we can write the groundtruth and the estimate as

¯X = {¯Ti}N
X = {Ti}M

i=1, ¯τ = {¯ti}N
i=1
i=1, τ = {ti}M
i=1.

(5)

(6)

Note that the times for the groundtruth and estimate ¯τ and τ
are not necessarily the same. For the case of perfect temporal
association, we should have ∀ti ∈ τ, ∃¯tki ∈ ¯τ : ¯tki = ti,
where ki is the index of the matching groundtruth for ti.
In addition, we intentionally associate uncertainties with the
groundtruth:

¯Λ = { ¯Σi}N

i=1 where ¯T(cid:48)

i ∼ N¯T(cid:48)

i

(¯Ti, ¯Σ).

(7)

One may argue that the uncertainties in the groundtruth are
negligible. While it is usually true for a single pose, we will
see later that introducing uncertainties to groundtruth allows
us to formulate the relative error in a more principled manner
(Section III-A) and handle imperfect temporal association
elegantly (Section IV).

With (5), (6) and (7) containing all the information about
the estimated and groundtruth trajectories, a general perfor-
mance metric should be a function of the form

f ( ¯X, ¯Λ, ¯τ , X, τ ).

(8)

The evaluation problem is about designing such a perfor-
mance metric. Next, we will generalize the concepts of ATE
and RE with the aforementioned notations.

III. GENERALIZED RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE ERROR

In this section, we derive the counterparts of the commonly
used RE and ATE from a probabilistic perspective, which
can be seen as the generalized versions of them. We assume
perfect temporal association in this section, and the general
case is handled in Section IV. To avoid the cluttering of
subscripts, we denote the corresponding groundtruth and
estimate as

¯X = {¯Ti}M

i=1, ¯Λ = { ¯Σi}M

i=1; X = {Ti}M

i=1.

(9)

A. Generalized Relative Error

The basic idea of RE is to perform evaluation on the
the
relative poses between pose pairs, and in this way,
ambiguity of the absolute reference frame is removed. Here
we consider the relative poses of consecutive estimated
poses. To put it formally, we have the relative poses as

¯Xr = {¯T−1
Xr = {T−1

¯Ti+1}M −1
i Ti+1}M −1

i=1 = {¯Ti,i+1}M −1
i=1 ,
i=1 = {Ti,i+1}M −1
i=1 .

i

(10)

(11)

Since we treat the groundtruth as stochastic variables, its
covariance also need to considered. For the stochastic poses
i and ¯T(cid:48)
¯T(cid:48)
i,i+1 = (¯T(cid:48)
¯T(cid:48)

i+1) = (¯Ti Exp(ξξξi))−1¯Ti+1 Exp(ξξξi+1)

i)−1(¯T(cid:48)

i+1

(2)= ¯Ti,i+1 Exp(− ¯Ai,i+1ξξξi) Exp(ξξξi+1),

(12)
where ¯Ai,j (cid:44) Ad¯Ti,j is the adjoint map of SE(3). Then the
random variable ξξξi,i+1 satisﬁes

Exp(ξξξi,i+1) = Exp(− ¯Ai,i+1ξξξi) Exp(ξξξi+1),

(13)

and ξξξi,i+1 can be expressed as inﬁnite series using Baker-
Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula [4]. Since both ξξξi and
ξξξi+1 are small (i.e.,
the groundtruth is usually of high
accuracy), we are justiﬁed to keep the ﬁrst-order terms

ξξξi,i+1 (cid:39) − ¯Ai,i+1ξξξi + ξξξi+1.

Stacking {ξξξi}M
as column vectors σσσ and
σσσr, we can write (14) collectively σσσr = Qσσσ, Since σσσ ∼
Nσσσ(0, ¯V ) with ¯V = diag( ¯Σi), we have [5, p. 41]
σσσr ∼ Nσσσr (0, Q ¯V Q(cid:62)) = Nσσσr (0, ¯Vr),

With (10), (11) and (15), we can now represent the error
between Xr and ¯Xr as the probability p(Xr| ¯Xr). We ﬁrst
calculate the difference in the relative poses er, which is a
column vector stacked up by

ei (cid:44) Log((¯Ti,i+1)−1Ti,i+1);

(16)

then the probability of the estimate given the groundtruth,
which is our generalized relative error, is
PRE(X| ¯X, ¯Λ) = Ner (0, ¯Vr).

(17)

It is worth noting that, from (14), we can see that there
is actually correlation between ξξξi−1,i and ξξξi,i+1, which is
captured by the off-diagonal blocks in ¯Vr (Fig. 1).

ATE tries to ﬁnd an optimal alignment transformation g∗
(usually in terms of position errors) ﬁrst and then use it to
calculate error metrics (in the world frame). The approach is
inherently problematic due to the fact that g∗ is calculated
from the estimate and then used in turn to evaluate the
estimate. In a probabilistic notation, the commonly used
ATE is actually

Note that we are using an noninformative prior [6, p. 117],
namely p(ξξξg) = 1, ∀ξξξg ∈ R6, in (19), which is not a proper
distribution. This means that LAE is not a valid PDF of the
estimate X any more.

Unfortunately, (19) is non-trivial to calculate analytically.
(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)i in (20) can be written as inﬁnite series (BCH formula).
But since we are considering ξξξg ∈ R6 (i.e., not necessarily
small), we cannot keep the ﬁrst-order terms only. However,
by examining the ﬁrst-order terms, we are able to draw
connections between (17) and (19).

C. Connection between Absolute and Relative Error

it

Conventional ATE and RE reason about estimation error
in completely different ways. However, it is usually observed
that they are strongly correlated [1]. With our probabilistic
setup,
is actually possible to establish the connection
between generalized absolute and relative error theoretically.
Starting from the generalized absolute error (19), without
loss of generality, we assume that ¯T1 = T1. The reason is
that we can always ﬁnd a ∆T such that ¯T1 = ˆT1 (cid:44) ∆T ·
T1, and using ˆTi for evaluation should give the same error
metric as Ti, since they are equivalent estimate [3]. Under
this assumption, (20) can be simpliﬁed for the ﬁrst pose as

(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)1 = Log(Exp( ¯A−1

1 ξξξg)¯T−1

1 Ti) = ¯A−1

1 ξξξg,

which also gives

d(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)1 = det | ¯A−1

1 |dξξξg

(3)= dξξξg.

(21)

(22)

We then further write the rest of the PDFs (i.e., i > 1) in
(19) in terms of (cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)1 by repeatedly applying (2) and (4) and
keeping the ﬁrst-order terms in BCH formula. For instance,
for the second pose:

(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)2 = Log(¯T−1

p(X| ¯X, g)|g=g∗ ,

(18)

And in general, for h ∈ [1, M ]

and worse still, the optimal g∗ is also not well-deﬁned.

Can we get rid of g in calculating the absolute error?
Looking at (18), a straightforward idea is to marginalize g. At
ﬁrst thought, marginalization seems to lose the information
about the reference frame. However, from the perspective
of an estimator (whose performance we want to evaluate),
there is simply no information about the unobservable DoFs.
Therefore, we propose to marginalize g in (18) to get the
generalized absolute error, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

In our setup, g is a rigid-body transformation parameter-
ized as an element in SE(3). Similar to [4], we integrate
exponential coordinates ξξξg ∈ R6 directly :

(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)h (cid:39) ¯Ah1(cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)1 + ¯Ah2e1 + · · · + ¯Ah,h−1eh−2 + eh−1,

the approximation (23), the individual Gaussian PDF can
be written in terms of (cid:15)(cid:15)(cid:15)1 as [5, p. 41]

the groundtruth samples.

where SAE is again a Gaussian function. It is worth noting
that SAE only depends on relative poses via (25) and (26) but
not the alignment transformation ξξξg. It is possible to further
prove that

SAE(X| ¯X, ¯Λ) = PRE(X| ¯X, ¯Λ).

(29)

The proof is straightforward (e.g., comparing the covariance
matrix and quadratic terms in the Gaussian functions) but
lengthy, and thus omitted for the sake of space. In words,
under our probabilistic setup, the generalized absolute error
(19) is the same as the generalized relative error (17) up to
the ﬁrst order.

D. Discussion

To summarize, in this section, we generalize the concepts
of RE and ATE respectively to (19) and (17) from a
probabilistic perspective. An interesting observation is that
up to the ﬁrst-order terms, the generalized relative error
and absolute error is actually the same. Admittedly,
the
equivalence that we established in Section III-C is only
valid for ﬁrst-order terms. One future direction is to examine
higher order terms in details.

IV. GROUNDTRUTH AS A GAUSSIAN PROCESS

In this section, we will ﬁrst give a brief introduction of
GP regression and then describe how to use GP to model
groundtruth trajectories in a continuous-time and probabilis-
tic manner.

A. Gaussian Process Regression

A Gaussian process is a collection of random variables,
and any subset of them has a joint Gaussian distribution [8].
In the context of a regression task, suppose we know the
samples at z = {zi}P
i=1, and

i=1 with the output y = {yi}P

which gives both the regressed value and variance.

Obviously, the properties of the prior (30) and the re-
gressed result (31) depends on the function k(·). k(a, b) is
called the kernel function, and intuitively encodes the cor-
relation of the outputs at a, b. Often k(·) is a parameterized
functions, whose parameters are the hyperparameters of a
GP. Perhaps the most used kernel function is the Squared
Exponential function

kSE(a, b) = σ2 exp(−

(a − b)2
2l2

),

(32)

where σ and l are the hyperparameters.

GP is a ﬂexible model that ﬁnds many applications in
robotics (e.g., motion planning [9], state estimation [10]).
For simplicity, the above introduction is limited to the case
where both the output and input are scalars. However, GP can
also be generalized to vector input and output. For a thorough
description of GP (e.g., optimization of hyperparameters), we
refer the reader to [8].

B. Piecewise GP on SE(3)

The application of GP to 6 DoF poses is more compli-
cated due to the rotation components in rigid-body poses.
We use a piecewise GP, similar to [11]. In particular, we
divide the whole trajectory into several segments. Within
each segments, we select a reference pose Tref and denote
the poses inside this segment using the elements in se(3)
around Tref, which can be seen as a vector space locally and
expressed using a GP.

Using a piecewise GP, however, brings complication to
the choice of hyperparameters. Speciﬁcally, if we optimize
a GP for each segment of the trajectory separately, there
is no guarantee that the uncertainties and the mean value
is continuous at the boundaries. In practice, we adopt the
following strategy: i) we select the segments so that the
adjacent segments overlap (e.g., 50%) with each other; ii)
we use the same hyperparameters for all the segments. An
example of the resulting piecewise GP is illustrated in Fig. 3.

C. Using GP in Trajectory Evaluation

Once we have constructed the piecewise GP to represent
the groundtruth, we are able to query the groundtruth at any
given time, with uncertainty estimate using (31), which can
then be directly used in our evaluation setup (8).

An example of the advantage of using GP can be observed
in Fig. 3. We can see that for query time that is far from the
groundtruth samples, the uncertainty increases. Intuitively,

45505560657075time(sec)0.60.70.80.91.01.11.2position(meter)GP0GP1GP2Groundtruthsampleswith a larger uncertainty, the same difference in the mean
value will result in a lower likelihood (i.e., larger error) in
(27) or (17). In this way, the temporal association is taken
into account properly.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we propose to formulate the trajectory evalu-
ation problem in a probabilistic, continuous-time framework.
By using Gaussian process as the underlying representation
and formulating the estimation error probabilistically, we are
able to draw theoretical connections between relative and
absolute error metrics and handle temporal association in a
principled manner.

Future work could go in several aspects:
• The equivalence of relative and absolute error metrics
in Section III is only proved up to ﬁrst order. It is
interesting to know whether similar conclusions can be
drawn for higher order terms.

• In Section IV, to make the piecewise GP continuous
(the mean values and variances), we adopted the simple
strategy of using overlapping segments with shared
hyperparameters. Ideally, the continuity should be en-
forced via additional constraints in the optimization of
the hyperparameters.

• Thorough comparative experiments are needed to better
understand the properties of the proposed method (com-
pared to existing approaches) in different situations.
