ABSTRACT

Context. Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) bursts are localised features thought to be driven by magnetic reconnection.
Although these events are well-studied, it remains unknown whether their properties vary as their host active regions (ARs) evolve.
Aims. In this article, we aim to understand whether the measurable properties (e.g. frequency, area, location, spectral characteristics)
of IRIS bursts are consistent during the evolution of their host ARs.
Methods. We study 42 dense 400-step rasters sampled by IRIS. These rasters each covered one of seven ARs, with each AR being
sampled at least four times over a minimum of 48 hours. An automated IRIS burst detection algorithm is used to identify IRIS burst
proﬁles in this work. Data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager are also used to provide context
about the co-spatial line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld.
Results. Of the rasters studied, 36 (86 %) were found to contain IRIS burst proﬁles. Five ARs (11850, 11909, 11916, 12104, and
12139) contained IRIS burst proﬁles in each raster that sampled them whilst one AR (11871) was found to contain no IRIS burst
proﬁles at any time. A total of 4019 IRIS burst proﬁles belonging to 752 connected objects, which we deﬁne as parent IRIS bursts,
were studied. IRIS burst proﬁles were only detected within compact regions in each raster, with these regions appearing to increase
in size as the host ARs aged. No systematic changes in the frequency of IRIS burst proﬁles or the spectral characteristic of IRIS burst
proﬁles through time were found for these ARs. Finally, 93 % of parent IRIS bursts with areas between 1 arcsec2 and 4 arcsec2 were
observed to occur co-spatial to bi-poles in the photosphere.
Conclusions. IRIS bursts are small-scale brightenings which have remarkably consistent spectral and spatial properties throughout
the evolution of ARs. These events predominantly form within the cores of larger and more complex ARs, with the regions containing
these events appearing to increase in size as the host region itself evolves.

1. Introduction

Small-scale burst activity has been widely observed across the
broad temperature range of the solar atmosphere, from Ellerman
bombs (EBs) in the photosphere (see, for example, Ellerman
1917; Vissers et al. 2013; Nelson et al. 2015), through UV bursts
in the transition region (as discussed by Peter et al. 2014; Judge
2015; Young et al. 2018), to the recently discovered campﬁres
in the corona (e.g. Berghmans et al. 2021; Mandal et al. 2021;
Panesar et al. 2021). Each of these dynamic events is thought to
be driven by localised magnetic reconnection between opposite
polarity magnetic ﬁelds, with the properties of the reconnection
(e.g. height in the atmosphere, amount of energy released) seem-
ingly dictating which type of burst is formed. Recent numerical
simulations have supported this assertion (see: Danilovic 2017
for EBs; Hansteen et al. 2017 for UV bursts; and Chen et al.
2021 for campﬁres) providing us with a clearer understanding of
the physical mechanisms responsible for these events. Despite
this general understanding, there is still much we don’t know
about these features, including whether UV bursts are detected
in all active regions (ARs) and whether their properties (poten-
tially diagnosing the physics of the magnetic reconnection driv-
ing these events) change during the evolution of the host ARs.

A new sub-set of UV bursts, characterised by large increases
in intensity in spectral lines sampling the transition region (in-
cluding the Si iv 1394 Å and 1403 Å lines), were identiﬁed re-
cently in data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS; De Pontieu et al. 2014) by Peter et al. (2014). Those au-
thors studied a raster sampling AR 11850 and found four burst
events, which were later named IRIS bursts in the literature, co-
spatial to bi-poles in the photosphere. It was suggested that these
events could be driven by magnetic reconnection heating the lo-
cal plasma to temperatures close to 80 kK. The presence of sev-
eral chromospheric absorption lines (e.g. Ni i 1393 Å) over-laid
on the IRIS burst spectra, however, indicated that these events
occurred deep in the solar atmosphere, potentially at heights
as low as several hundred km. Subsequent research found that
IRIS bursts could occur co-spatial to EBs (Vissers et al. 2015;
Tian et al. 2016), which are known to have temperatures well be-
low the typical formation temperatures of the Si iv lines (see, for
example, Fang et al. 2006; Hong et al. 2014), and cancelling bi-
poles (e.g. Nelson et al. 2016) in the photosphere. Dedicated 1D
modelling eﬀorts have so far been unable to reproduce co-spatial
EB and IRIS burst spectra, in part due to their large temperature
diﬀerences (e.g. Reid et al. 2017; Hong et al. 2017).

In order to better assess the overall impact of IRIS bursts on
the global solar atmosphere, Kleint & Panos (2022) conducted
an extensive statistical analysis of IRIS burst proﬁles using the
more than 3500 IRIS spectral datasets sampled during 2013 and

2014 (utilising the methods detailed in Panos et al. 2021 and
Panos & Kleint 2021). Those authors considered a Si iv 1394 Å
spectra to be IRIS burst-like if absorption lines were over-laid
on it, agreeing with one of the key observational characteristics
of these events as noted by Young et al. (2018). More than 100
k IRIS spectra satisﬁed this criteria (within 287 datasets), indi-
cating that around 0.01 % of all Si iv 1394 Å spectra recorded
by IRIS are IRIS burst proﬁles. Of the sample reported, no IRIS
burst proﬁles were detected in the quiet-Sun or close to the solar
poles suggesting that these events occur exclusively in ARs. It
is likely, therefore, that the potential quiet-Sun IRIS burst pre-
sented by Nelson et al. (2017) would not have been classed as
being IRIS burst-like by this algorithm (if it had been applied to
that dataset) due to the lack of clear absorption lines over-laid on
the relatively narrow Si iv 1394 Å line. Finally, no systematic in-
crease in emission co-spatial to IRIS burst proﬁles was found ei-
ther for the IRIS Fe xxi line or for the EUV lines sampled by the
Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(SDO/AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) by Kleint & Panos (2022) sug-
gesting that the magnetic reconnection hypothesised to be driv-
ing these events does not heat the local plasma to coronal (>106
K) temperatures.

Although we focus speciﬁcally on IRIS bursts in this arti-
cle, it should be noted that a whole host of other burst events
have also been detected in the solar atmosphere in spectral win-
dows sampling similar temperature ranges. This wider family
of events are collectively known as UV bursts, and include fea-
tures such as explosive events (Dere et al. 1989) and blinkers
(Harrison 1997). Whilst one of the unique deﬁning properties
of IRIS bursts are the characteristic overlying absorption lines on
the Si iv 1394 Å spectra, other types of UV bursts have a plethora
of other spectral shapes (some are extremely narrow whilst some
are extremely broad) and properties (some are symmetric about
the spectral line whilst some display broadenings in only the red
or blue wings). This large variance in spectral signatures means
other UV burst types will not be identiﬁed by the version of the
algorithm developed by Kleint & Panos (2022). The inclusion of
more template spectra would be required if these other types of
UV bursts were to be studied in an automated manner in the fu-
ture. The spectral diﬀerences between distinct types of UV bursts
also means that the deﬁning properties of this family of events
must be taken from other observable properties, with key signa-
tures being that they are: i) compact (areas typically below 2′′);
ii) short-lived (lifetimes of up to around one hour); iii) intense
compared to the local background; iv) relatively stationary; and
v) not linked to larger-scale ﬂares. Given these properties it is,
therefore, possible for an event to display an IRIS burst proﬁle
but not be a UV burst. For a comprehensive review of both IRIS
bursts and the wider family of UV bursts see Young et al. (2018).

The algorithm developed by Kleint & Panos (2022) provides
numerous opportunities for advancing our understanding of the
importance of IRIS bursts in the solar atmosphere. In this arti-
cle, we utilise a slightly modiﬁed version of this algorithm to
investigate how the measurable properties of IRIS bursts (e.g.
frequency, area, location, spectral characteristics) in large IRIS
rasters vary during the evolution of seven ARs. The motiva-
tion behind this research is to identify whether there are pref-
erential conditions for when and where magnetic energy is re-
leased in ARs as they evolve. We structure our work as follows:
In Sect 2 we detail the data products analysed and outline the
changes made to the IRIS burst detection algorithm; In Sect. 3
we present the results of our research and a brief discussion; be-
fore in Sect. 4 we draw our conclusions.

this article, with diﬀerent colours corresponding to diﬀerent ARs. IRIS
burst proﬁles are detected in multiple rasters sampled over multiple days
for six of the seven ARs. Clearly, no IRIS burst proﬁles were detected
at any time within AR 11871. General information about the identiﬁed
IRIS burst proﬁles is presented in Table A.1.

2. Methods

2.1. Observations

The primary data products analysed in this research were sam-
pled by IRIS, a highly versatile instrument which can be em-
ployed in a plethora of observing modes allowing the user to
vary the spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions of the re-
turned data based on scientiﬁc need. This versatility creates a
comprehensive data catalogue but also means we must ﬁlter the
available datasets in order to isolate only those of interest for this
particular study. Here, we focus our analysis on ARs that were
sampled by a minimum of four separate 400-step IRIS rasters in
the time-period studied by Kleint & Panos (2022). These obser-
vations must include the Si iv 1394 Å line, and have time dif-
ferences between the ﬁrst and ﬁnal rasters of at least 48 hours.
Seven ARs (11850, 11856, 11871, 11909, 11916, 12104, and
12139) satisﬁed these criteria, forming the sample we analyse
here. Of these, two ARs (11871 and 11916) emerged onto the
solar disk between one and three days prior to their ﬁrst IRIS
raster scans, whilst the remaining ﬁve (11850, 11856, 11909,
12104, and 12139) rotated onto the solar disk as fully formed
ARs between four and six days prior to the ﬁrst IRIS raster scans
which sampled them.

Overall, 42 IRIS datasets were analysed in this study.
Each of these datasets had a raster step size of 0.35′′ and
a pixel scale along the slit of 0.17′′, allowing us to consis-
tently measure the properties of IRIS bursts. General informa-
tion about each of these datasets is provided for reference in
Table A.1. From this sample, 35 datasets were found to con-
tain a combined total of 4019 IRIS burst proﬁles using the
modiﬁed IRIS burst detection algorithm. This accounts for 0.02
% of the total number of IRIS Si iv 1394 Å proﬁles analysed

12104 at the core wavelength of the Si iv 1394 line (logarithmically scaled to enhance contrast). Our algorithm did not identify any bursts in this
raster. The two times during which IRIS passed through the SAA, thereby causing noisy spectra, during this observation are marked by red arrows.
The orange circles locate two pixels whose spectra are shown in the right-hand panels (black lines), one containing a manually detected burst and
the other containing no burst spectra. (Right-hand panels) The two IRIS spectra selected to demonstrate how a small number of IRIS burst proﬁles
may be missed by the algorithm. The top panel plots a manually detected IRIS burst with a clear, albeit shallow, absorption blend over-laid on
the Si iv 1394 Å line, while the bottom panel is a typical non-burst spectrum. Both spectra are normalised to their peak intensity. We over-plot the
mathematically closest reference spectrum considered by the algorithm to each of these proﬁles (blue lines), which in both cases is a non-burst
reference spectrum. Therefore, no IRIS burst proﬁle is found for either pixel by the algorithm. The nearest IRIS burst reference spectrum to the
manually detected IRIS burst proﬁle is also over-plotted on the top panel for reference (orange line).

here. To supplement this automated detection, we also con-
ducted a manual analysis of the remaining seven datasets using
CRISPEX (Vissers & Rouppe van der Voort 2012) in order to
identify whether any clear and obvious IRIS burst proﬁles were
missed by the algorithm. IRIS burst proﬁles, identiﬁed through
the presence of absorption lines on the Si iv 1394 Å spectra for
consistency, were detected in one further dataset through these
checks. The remaining six datasets did not appear to contain
any clear and obvious IRIS burst proﬁles (we cannot deﬁnitively
state that a small number of pixels did not evade our manual
search which will have been biased towards more intense pix-
els). The locations on the Sun of each of the IRIS burst proﬁles
detected using automated methods are plotted in Fig. 1. The dif-
ferent coloured boxes correspond to diﬀerent ARs, as detailed in
the legend.

Given longer exposure times may lead to an increase in the
number of saturated pixels (which are removed from the sample
before the algorithm is applied), it is also important to investigate
the numbers of potential IRIS burst proﬁles removed from each
of these datasets before any additional analysis is conducted. In

order to test this, we identiﬁed all pixels which were saturated
(counts> 16180) at one or more spectral positions in the wave-
length range 1393.75 ± 0.2 Å. In total 239 pixels matched this
criterion across all 42 datasets with approximately 100 of these
appearing to be caused by cosmic ray spikes and another 100
appearing to be some other kind of burst, with relatively nar-
row spectra and no absorption lines over-laid on the Si iv 1394
Å spectra. This, therefore, left around 40 potential IRIS burst
proﬁles which were spread across four datasets. Around half of
these saturated potential IRIS burst proﬁles were found in the
ﬁrst dataset sampling AR 11916, which already contained 715
IRIS burst proﬁles, whilst the others were detected in the seventh
raster to sample AR 11916, the ﬁrst raster sampling AR 12104,
and the third raster sampling AR 12104. Overall, the small num-
bers of saturated pixels displaying potential IRIS burst proﬁles
(less than 1 % of the sample studied here) and the centralisation
of these to only a small number of datasets indicates that the re-
moval of saturated pixels does not overly inﬂuence the results
obtained in this manuscript.

We also made use of data from SDO’s Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) in order to
study the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld co-spatial to the
IRIS observations. Full-disk LOS magnetic ﬁeld maps were
downloaded with a cadence of one hour in the time-period span-
ning from six hours prior to the start time of the ﬁrst IRIS raster
to six hours after the end time of the last IRIS raster for each
AR. A zoomed 180′′×180′′ ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) cut-out was
then created co-temporal to the ﬁrst IRIS scan centred on the
pointing co-ordinates of that raster. All other SDO/HMI frames
were then de-rotated to that time, before a co-spatial cut-out
was constructed in order to create a consistent FOV through the
entire time-period. Comparisons of these SDO/HMI maps with
plage regions in the IRIS rasters indicated that these alignments
were reasonable (estimated errors < 5′′). As we only study the
overall behaviour of the magnetic ﬁeld within the entire ARs
and the general structure of the magnetic ﬁeld co-spatial to the
IRIS burst proﬁles through time, no further alignment between
instruments was conducted. These SDO/HMI data have a post-
reduction pixel scale of 0.6′′ which is more than adequate for
investigating the overall behaviour of these ARs.

2.2. Modiﬁcationsto the IRIS burst detection algorithm

To detect IRIS burst proﬁles, the algorithm of Kleint & Panos
(2022) was used with slight modiﬁcations applied in order to
both be able to study rasters that may have a small number of
IRIS burst proﬁles and ﬁx two minor bugs, which became ap-
parent during this analysis. To tackle the ﬁrst issue, the crite-
rion of requiring at least 30 potential IRIS burst proﬁles applied
by Kleint & Panos (2022) was dropped and any observation that
had at least one candidate IRIS burst proﬁle was analysed fur-
ther. This increased the sample of IRIS burst proﬁles detected
within these 42 rasters from 2462 to 3113 (a 26.44 % increase).
Following this adaption, the ﬁrst bug, related to times when the
IRIS orbit passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)
and hence returns noisy spectra, became apparent in the results.
Speciﬁcally, the IRIS FITS SAA level2 keyword defaults to the
value that is true for most of the observation. Therefore, observa-
tions where more time was spent in the SAA than outside of the
SAA (which is very rare) will have this keyword set to 1 at all
times and were, thus, excluded in the ﬁrst version of the pipeline.
The ﬁrst version of the pipeline correctly queried the level1 data,
which includes the actual ﬂag for SAA/no SAA and updated the
corresponding header entry in the level2 data to 1 during times of
SAA. However, it did not check if the header entry may already
be set to 1 due to the convention of the level2 data for SAA dom-
inant datasets, even though no SAA occurred at the speciﬁc time
when the spectra were sampled. The new version of the pipeline
does both checks.

The second bug is related to the fact that the Si iv observing
window width changed slightly with the evolution of the IRIS
linelists, and between the diﬀerent types of linelists. The origi-
nal pipeline had a bug with extrapolations of spectra, leading to
unintended values far away from the Si iv lines. This did not af-
fect strong bursts (since the signal is near the line center and the
continuum is close to zero due to the normalization), which have
always been classiﬁed properly, but it could mistakenly classify
noisy burst spectra into a non-burst category. Extrapolated val-
ues are now properly set to zero and thus do not aﬀect the clas-
siﬁcation. The classiﬁcation in Kleint & Panos (2022) focused
on minimizing false-positives and if in doubt, a spectrum was
excluded from being of burst-type so this should not have inﬂu-
enced their results excessively. Applying the algorithm follow-

Article number, page 4 of 12

ing these subsequent modiﬁcations increased the sample further
from 3113 IRIS burst proﬁles to a total of 4019 IRIS burst pro-
ﬁles (a further increase of 29.10 %). These new IRIS burst pro-
ﬁles mostly have very weak absorption lines and/or are noisy,
but do visually look like bursts so are included here for com-
pleteness. Notably, these events were detected across a total of
35 datasets, up from 15 using the algorithm before removal of
the 30 spectra criterion and the subsequent modiﬁcations.

It should be mentioned, however, that the variety of burst
spectra makes it impossible to catch every single burst with a
classiﬁcation template of “only” 423 diﬀerent spectral types. We
are conﬁdent, though, that the most common types of burst spec-
tra are identiﬁed reliably. An example of an IRIS burst proﬁle
which was not detected by the pipeline is displayed in Fig. 2.
In the left-hand panel we plot the intensity of the Si iv 1394 Å
line core for the fourth raster sampling AR 12104 (i.e. the raster
where IRIS bursts were detected manually but not automati-
cally). The locations where IRIS passed through the SAA during
this observation are marked by the red arrows. The orange cir-
cles outline two pixels, one containing a manually detected IRIS
burst proﬁle and one containing a non-burst proﬁle, chosen for
reference. In the right-hand panels, the black lines plot the ob-
served spectra at each of these pixels with clear, albeit shallow,
absorption blends indicative of an IRIS burst proﬁle visible on
the top panel. The blue lines plot the reference spectra deemed
to be the closest mathematically to the observed spectra which
in both cases is a non-burst reference spectra. The orange line
included on the top panel plots the closest IRIS burst reference
spectrum to this spectrum, which was mathematically ‘further’
from the observed spectrum than the non-burst reference spec-
trum (distance of 0.83 compared to a distance of 0.52). The only
way to improve detections of such bursts would be to increase
the number of template reference spectra from the 423 currently
used. Given we only found a very small number (around ten) of
additional IRIS burst proﬁles through our manual checks, and
adding further reference spectra risks increasing the rate of false
detections, we did not deem this necessary for this study.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. General AR properties

To begin our analysis, we investigated the general properties of
each AR in order to better contextualise any subsequent infer-
ences about IRIS bursts. Firstly, we identiﬁed the number of
raster scans which displayed IRIS burst proﬁles for each AR
ﬁnding varying behaviour. Of the seven ARs studied here, ﬁve
(11850, 11909, 11916, 12104, and 12139) contained IRIS burst
proﬁles in each raster scan, including both IRIS burst proﬁles
detected using automated methods and those identiﬁed through
the subsequent manual analysis. AR 11916 contained the most
automatically detected IRIS burst proﬁles, with 2052 (51.06 %
of the total sample studied here) being identiﬁed over the eight
rasters analysed, whilst the other four ARs each contained be-
tween 1144 and 168 automatically detected IRIS burst proﬁles.
On top of this, one AR (11856) was found to contain IRIS burst
proﬁles in some but not all rasters and one AR (11871) was
found to contain no IRIS burst proﬁles at any time. This anal-
ysis indicates that the age of the AR is not a deﬁning factor in
whether IRIS burst proﬁles are present with the two youngest
ARs (11871 and 11916), which both emerged onto the solar disk
in the three days prior to the IRIS scans, displaying sharply con-
trasting behaviour.

these regions during the time studied. (Middle column) The Si iv 1394 Å line core intensity sampled from the IRIS raster with start time closest

hand column) The evolution of the total unsigned (solid lines), positive (dashed lines), and negative (dotted lines) magnetic ﬂux within the wider
180′′×180′′ FOV through the time-period studied here for each AR. The red contours over-laid on the left-hand column outline the IRIS burst
proﬁles returned using automated methods from the IRIS raster plotted in the respective middle column. The ﬁve ARs with the highest peak
magnitudes of the unsigned ﬂux were found to contain the majority of the IRIS burst proﬁles identiﬁed here.

Secondly, we calculated the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux
within a zoomed 180′′×180′′ FOV around each AR at each
SDO/HMI time-step. Interestingly, the ﬁve ARs which contained
IRIS burst proﬁles in each raster had the ﬁve highest peak ﬂuxes
(1.44 × 1021 Mx, 1.66 × 1021 Mx, 1.91 × 1021 Mx, 2.23 × 1021
Mx, and 1.50 × 1021 Mx for ARs 11850, 11909, 11916, 12104,
and 12139, respectively) with each exceeding 1021 Mx. The re-
maining two ARs, which contained either a small number or
zero IRIS burst proﬁles, both had peak ﬂuxes of less than 1021

Mx (8.60 × 1020 Mx and 5.38 × 1020 Mx for ARs 11856 and
11871, respectively). In the left-hand column of Fig. 3, we plot
100′′×100′′ zoomed SDO/HMI images sampled at the time at
which the peak unsigned magnetic ﬂux was measured for three
ARs (11850, 11871, and 11916 from top to bottom, respec-
tively). The middle column of Fig. 3 plots the IRIS Si iv 1394
Å line core intensity across this FOV sampled at the closest
raster to the SDO/HMI images, with the pointing corrected for
solar rotation. The red contours over-laid on the SDO/HMI im-

individually coloured) occurring in this small region. (Middle panel) Histogram of parent IRIS burst area against frequency constructed using

subsequent rasters within which IRIS bursts were detected. The physical number of bursts plotted in each bar segment can be found in Table A.1.

ages outline the locations of the IRIS burst proﬁles identiﬁed in
these rasters using automated methods. The right-hand column
of Fig. 3 plots the evolution of the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux
(solid line), positive ﬂux (dashed line), and negative ﬂux (dot-
ted line) calculated from the larger 180′′×180′′ SDO/HMI FOV
with time. Clearly, ARs 11916 and 11850 are more complex in
their magnetic structuring (left-panels of Fig. 3) and have total
unsigned magnetic ﬂuxes which initially increase before reach-
ing a peak and then decreasing (right-panels of Fig. 3). On the
other hand, AR 11871 is less complex and has a total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux which slowly decreases with time. Our results in-
dicate that the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux and the complexity
of the structuring of that ﬂux within an AR may be a dominant
factor determining whether IRIS bursts are widely detected or
not, rather than the age of the AR.

3.2. Spatialproperties of IRIS burst proﬁles

We continued our analysis by grouping the 4019 IRIS burst pro-
ﬁles identiﬁed here into separate, connected objects which we
deﬁne as parent IRIS bursts. To achieve this, we created binary
maps of the locations of IRIS burst proﬁles within each raster
scan and then combined IRIS burst proﬁles which were adja-
cent in the x − y plane together into parent IRIS bursts. If two
parent IRIS bursts were separated by even one pixel, we consid-
ered that they were diﬀerent events. Additionally, if the obser-
vational routine had more than one raster then only the middle
raster was considered here in order to avoid longer-lived par-
ent IRIS bursts, potentially present in repeated rasters, being
counted multiple times. Importantly, our analysis of these par-
ent UV bursts does not include any temporal component. This
stipulation only removed 119 IRIS burst proﬁles from our sam-
ple meaning it should not have a major inﬂuence on our results.
Overall, this analysis returned 752 parent IRIS bursts spread
across the 35 IRIS rasters. In the left-hand panel of Fig. 4, we
plot an example of a binary map displaying the locations of nu-
merous IRIS burst proﬁles from one speciﬁc raster within AR
11850. This plot is calculated from the dataset which was used

by Peter et al. (2014) to originally identify IRIS bursts, with the
four largest parent IRIS bursts corresponding to the four events
studied by those authors. This clearly shows the eﬀectiveness of
the algorithm developed by Kleint & Panos (2022) and modiﬁed
here. The zoomed cut-out over-laid on this panel more clearly
displays how adjacent IRIS burst proﬁles are combined to form
separate parent IRIS bursts. Nine parent IRIS bursts are present
within this small FOV, with each event being plotted in a diﬀer-
ent colour.

In the middle panel of Fig. 4, we plot a histogram of parent
IRIS burst area against frequency for all of the 752 identiﬁed
events. The histogram is binned across 0.3 arcsec2 (ﬁve pixels)
and the y-axis is plotted using a logarithmic scale. Clearly, the
majority of the studied events are small, with 383 of these parent
IRIS bursts having areas of only one pixel. The mean area of this
sample of parent IRIS bursts is 0.31 arcsec2 (corresponding to
5.19 pixels); however, the distribution is non-Gaussian and the
standard deviation of this sample is 0.72 arcsec2 (12.18 pixels),
more than double the mean, suggesting one should not interpret
this as a precise estimate. Our results do, though, clearly indicate
that the majority of parent IRIS bursts are extremely small-scale.
Notably, several larger brightenings in the Si iv 1394 Å line core
are found to contain numerous parent IRIS bursts through our
analysis. For example, one 6.30′′×2.72′′ region in the second
raster sampling AR 12104 (around xc ≈ 200′′, yc ≈ −296′′)
was found to contain 20 parent IRIS bursts, with an average area
of 0.12 arcsec2 (corresponding to 1.57 pixels). From the entire
sample studied here, only 52 parent IRIS bursts (6.91 %) have an
area over 1 arcsec2 (corresponding to 17 pixels) with 28 of these
occurring in AR 11916. The largest parent IRIS burst occurred
in AR 11916 and had an area of 8.98 arcsec2 (corresponding to
151 pixels), much larger than the typical sizes of UV bursts in
general (see Young et al. 2018).

In the right-hand panel of Fig. 4, we plot a bar chart dis-
playing the number of parent IRIS bursts identiﬁed per AR. The
colours in each bar indicate parent IRIS bursts identiﬁed in dif-
ferent rasters, with the bottom (light yellow) portion correspond-
ing to the ﬁrst raster within which IRIS burst proﬁles were iden-

tiﬁed for that speciﬁc AR. A high proportion of the parent IRIS
bursts were found within ARs 11850 and 11916 (70.61 % of the
total sample) whilst AR 11871 contains zero parent IRIS bursts.
The highest number of parent IRIS bursts in a single raster was
65, which were identiﬁed in the ﬁrst raster sampling AR 11916,
with the mean number of parent IRIS bursts per raster being
17.90. The average area of the parent IRIS bursts was found to
change in a seemingly random way from raster to raster (nei-
ther monotonically increasing or decreasing) as the host ARs
evolved. In total, ten rasters within the sample analysed here con-
tained more than 30 parent IRIS bursts, with ﬁve of these occur-
ring in AR 11916, three occurring in AR 11850, and one occur-
ring in both ARs 12104 and 12139. Overall, these results imply a
parent IRIS burst spatial frequency of 0.00069 arcsec−2 in ARs,
well below the spatial frequency of, for example, spicules in the
chromosphere. See Table A.1 for a summary of these ﬁndings.

3.3. Locations of IRIS burst proﬁles withinARs

One of the main aims of this research is to identify whether IRIS
burst proﬁles are detected randomly across ARs or whether they
are conﬁned to consistent localised regions through time. In or-
der to analyse this, we studied the locations of IRIS burst proﬁles
within the two ARs (namely ARs 11850 and 11916) for which
more than 100 IRIS burst proﬁles were detected using the al-

gorithm in more than one raster. We de-rotated each raster to a
consistent pointing which we converted as the origin (0′′, 0′′),
constructed binary maps of the locations of IRIS burst proﬁles,
and then calculated the centres-of-mass of IRIS burst proﬁles
for each raster. In Fig. 5, we plot a visualisation of this analysis
on maps of the Si iv 1394 Å line core intensity (logarithmically
scaled) from one representative raster for each AR (11850 in the
left-hand panel and 11916 in the right-hand panel). The over-
laid contours denote the locations of IRIS burst proﬁles and the
crosses indicate the centres-of-mass for each speciﬁc raster. The
relationship between colour and raster number is consistent with
the colours used in the right-hand panel of Fig. 4.

For both ARs, IRIS burst proﬁles were found to be predom-
inantly localised to relatively small regions, with approximate
areas of 100′′×60′′. The centres-of-mass of IRIS burst proﬁles
also appeared to be consistent through time for both ARs, only
varying by a maximum of 31.11′′ in AR 11850 and 37.96′′ in AR
11916. In general, the locations of IRIS burst proﬁles within the
ARs appeared to be limited to the most pronounced polarity in-
version lines, as would be expected for events hypothesised to be
driven by magnetic reconnection. Interestingly, IRIS burst pro-
ﬁles in both of these ARs appeared to become more spatially sep-
arated through time, with the contours in Fig. 5 appearing further
away from the centres-of-mass for subsequent rasters. In order
to investigate this, we calculated the average separation between

the IRIS burst proﬁles and the centres-of-mass through time for
the rasters containing more than 100 IRIS burst proﬁles. For
AR 11850, this separation increased from 13.00′′ (±10.42′′) to
45.46′′ (±9.20′′) over the ﬁve rasters studied here; whilst for AR
11916, the average separation increased from 9.51′′ (±10.32′′)
to 32.10′′ (±15.07′′) over the ﬁrst ﬁve rasters before decreas-
ing again to 18.63′′ (±15.04′′) by the sixth raster. Although this
analysis indicates there may be an increase in the separation of
IRIS burst proﬁles within an AR as it evolves, we note that two

Article number, page 8 of 12

ARs were studied and large standard deviations were calculated,
meaning this result is still tentative and requires further analysis
using a larger sample of ARs in the future.

3.4. Spectral properties of IRIS burst proﬁles

To continue our analysis, we next investigated whether several
spectral properties of IRIS burst proﬁles varied systematically
during the evolution of ARs or whether they remained relatively

region of 5′′×5′′ centred on the location of the parent IRIS burst from the closest SDO/HMI image in time, de-rotated to the time of IRIS burst
proﬁle detection. The red and blue contours outline regions of positive and negative magnetic ﬁelds saturated at 20 G and −20 G, respectively,
whilst the orange contours outline the approximate locations of the parent IRIS bursts. Opposite polarity magnetic ﬁelds are found within the FOV
for 43 (93 %) of these parent IRIS bursts.

consistent. Once again, only rasters within ARs 11850 (left-hand
panels) and 11916 (right-hand panels) which contained more
than 100 IRIS burst proﬁles were studied in order to provide ap-
propriate statistics. In Fig. 6, we plot the distributions of three
parameters calculated from the Si iv 1394 Å spectra sampled
at all pixels automatically identiﬁed as IRIS burst proﬁles, for
the appropriate rasters. The top panels plot the mean intensity
(logarithmically scaled) from a ±0.075 Å window around the
Si iv 1394 Å line core, the middle panels plot the logarithmically
scaled peak intensity of the Si iv 1394 Å line for the identiﬁed
IRIS burst proﬁles, whilst the bottom panels plot the spectral
positions where the maximum intensity was measured for each
IRIS burst proﬁle. The diamonds on each distribution indicate
the mean value calculated for that raster, and the top and bottom
crosses plot the 75th and 25th percentile values, respectively.
Overall, although some changes in the distributions are observed
between speciﬁc rasters, no systematic changes (e.g. monotonic
intensity increases, transitions from blue to red shifts) in these
parameters is detected as the ARs age.

Following on from this, we also studied which reference
spectra were returned the most frequently as the ‘closest’ ﬁts
to the IRIS burst proﬁles identiﬁed in each of these rasters. This
analysis allowed us to infer whether any changes in the common
spectral shapes of IRIS burst proﬁles are present through time. In
these datasets, no single reference spectrum was found to be the
most accurate mathematical match to more than 7.34 % of all of
the IRIS burst proﬁles within a single raster. Additionally, unique
reference spectra were found to make up, on average across these
datasets, 47.57 % of all of the observed spectra indicating that a
huge variety of spectral shapes of IRIS burst proﬁles exist for
each dataset. These two combined facts suggest that no pref-
erential reference spectrum is present in any given raster, with
the identiﬁed IRIS burst proﬁles being randomly spread between
diﬀerent reference spectra.

3.5. Relationsto the local LOS magneticﬁeld

Our ﬁnal analysis focused on the relationship between the parent
IRIS bursts identiﬁed in this study and the co-spatial under-lying
LOS magnetic ﬁeld structure as inferred by the SDO/HMI in-
strument. It is well known that IRIS bursts often occur co-spatial
to regions of opposite polarity magnetic ﬁeld (see, for example,
Young et al. 2018) where magnetic reconnection is thought to be
possible in the lower solar atmosphere. As the SDO/HMI instru-
ment has a spatial resolution of approximately 1′′, we only stud-
ied parent IRIS bursts with areas greater than 1 arcsec2 (corre-
sponding to approximately 17 pixels). Additionally, we removed
the parent IRIS bursts with areas above 4 arcsec2 (corresponding
to 70 pixels) as the foot-points of those events would be diﬃcult
to deﬁne in a consistent manner. These stipulations left 46 par-
ent IRIS bursts for analysis. In Fig. 7, we plot the LOS magnetic
ﬁeld saturated at ±100 G sampled for a 5′′×5′′ FOV surrounding
the centre of each parent IRIS burst. The red and blue contours
outline positive and negative polarity LOS magnetic ﬁelds at val-
ues of 20 G and −20 G, respectively, while the orange contours
outline the locations of the parent IRIS bursts. The magnetic ﬁeld
map for each event was constructed by de-rotating the closest
temporal frame in the respective one hour cadence SDO/HMI
dataset to the time at which the parent IRIS burst was detected,
meaning the locations of the bursts with respect to the magnetic
ﬁeld are only an approximation. Although this method will have
some inherent errors on small-scales, the alignment appears to
work well for the full FOV (as can be seen in Fig. 3) giving us

Article number, page 10 of 12

conﬁdence that a closer alignment is not required for this general
analysis.

Overall, 43 (93 %) of the panels plotted in Fig. 7 contain
bi-poles in the LOS magnetic ﬁeld within the 5′′×5′′ surround-
ing the parent IRIS bursts. For the three remaining events, one
occurs co-spatial to an apparently uni-polar region of positive
polarity ﬂux and the other two occur co-spatial to apparently
uni-polar regions of negative polarity ﬂux. As the magnetic ﬁeld
maps could have been measured up to ±30 minutes around the
detection of the parent IRIS burst, we note that these magnetic
ﬁeld maps may not be entirely representative of the exact mag-
netic ﬁeld structure at the time of potential reconnection as, for
example, cancellation could have occurred removing evidence
of any bi-poles (see for example, Nelson et al. 2016) for the
three uni-polar events. Additionally, the spatial resolution of the
SDO/HMI instrument may be insuﬃcient for resolving all of
the magnetic ﬁeld elements at these locations (as discussed by
Reid et al. 2016) which could cause us to detect a uni-polar re-
gion when a bi-polar region was actually present. It is clear, how-
ever, that the majority of parent IRIS bursts with areas between
1 arcsec2 and 4 arcsec2 occur co-spatial to regions of opposite
polarity magnetic ﬁeld in the lower solar atmosphere, support-
ing the assertion that these events could be driven by magnetic
reconnection.

4. Conclusions

In this article, we used a slightly modiﬁed (see Sect. 2.2) version
of the algorithm originally applied in Kleint & Panos (2022) in
order to investigate whether changes in the measurable proper-
ties of IRIS burst proﬁles occurred as their host ARs evolved. We
studied 42 dense IRIS rasters which each sampled one of seven
host ARs, with each AR being sampled at least four times. We
found:

– The maximum total unsigned magnetic ﬂux within an AR,
and the complexity of the structuring of that ﬂux, may be
important as an indicator of whether IRIS burst proﬁles are
present. The two ARs with the lowest peak total unsigned
magnetic ﬂuxes contained far fewer IRIS burst proﬁles than
the ﬁve ARs with the highest unsigned magnetic ﬂuxes.
Speciﬁcally, AR 11871 (with a peak unsigned magnetic ﬂux
of 5.38 × 1020) was found to contain no IRIS burst proﬁles in
the four rasters which sampled it, whilst AR 11856 (with a
peak unsigned magnetic ﬂux of 8.60×1020 was found to con-
tain only 25 IRIS burst proﬁles (0.62 % of the total number of
IRIS burst proﬁles studied here) across the ﬁve rasters which
sampled it. The age of the AR was not found to inﬂuence
the number of IRIS burst proﬁles returned by the algorithm,
with the two youngest ARs (11916 and 11871) being found
to contain the most and least IRIS burst proﬁles, respectively.
– In total, 4019 IRIS burst proﬁles were returned by the algo-
rithm from these 42 rasters, with these being found to be-
long to 752 parent IRIS bursts. These parent IRIS bursts had
a mean area of 0.31 arcsec2, with 93.09 % of the identiﬁed
events having areas below 1 arcsec2 (centre panel of Fig. 4).
We note that the mean area should not be over-interpreted
due to the large standard deviation from this dataset (0.72
arcsec2) but it can be used to show that these events are typi-
cally small-scale. The frequencies and areas of these features
did not monotonically increase or decrease as the host ARs
evolved but instead varied in a seemingly randomly man-
ner from raster to raster. The largest parent IRIS burst found
through this analysis had an apparent area of 8.98 arcsec2

Nelson et al.: IRIS Burst Properties

(corresponding to 151 pixels). The overall spatial frequency
of IRIS burst proﬁles across the studied ARs was calculated
to be 0.00069 arcsec−2, well below the coverage of spicules,
for example.

– IRIS burst proﬁles are typically conﬁned to localised re-
gions (around 100′′×60′′ for the two ARs studied here) close
to the cores of ARs (as is displayed in Fig. 5). The av-
erage spatial separation between the centre-of-mass of all
IRIS burst proﬁles within a raster and the individual IRIS
burst proﬁles themselves appeared to increase with time in
ARs 11850 and 11916 (the only ARs which contained more
than 100 IRIS burst proﬁles in multiple rasters), suggesting
IRIS bursts occurred across a larger area as their host ARs
evolved. This increase in area potentially corresponds to the
growth of the ARs themselves. These results suggest that
one must be very careful when selecting appropriate targets
for co-observations of IRIS burst-Ellerman bomb pairs with
ground-based telescopes with limited FOVs, e.g. with the
Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST; Rimmele et al.
2020; Rast et al. 2021).

– The spectral properties (e.g. peak intensities, spectral loca-
tions of the peak intensities) of IRIS burst proﬁles varied
in a non-monotonic way in datasets sampling ARs 11850
and 11916 which contained more than 100 IRIS burst pro-
ﬁles, and then only slightly, through time. On top of this, the
automatically detected IRIS burst proﬁles were found to be
spread across a large number of the reference spectra used
by the detection algorithm with, on average, unique refer-
ence spectra equalling 47.57 % of the total number of IRIS
burst proﬁles in any given raster. Additionally, no individ-
ual reference spectrum was found to be the best ﬁt for more
than 7.34 % of the IRIS burst proﬁles returned for any given
raster. These combined result indicate that no ‘typical’ IRIS
burst spectra exists for the rasters studied here.

– 93 % of all parent IRIS bursts with areas between 1 arcsec2
and 4 arcsec2 occurred co-spatial to bi-poles in the so-
lar photosphere. This result further supports the assertion
that these events are driven by magnetic reconnection in
the lower solar atmosphere (Peter et al. 2014; Vissers et al.
2015; Hansteen et al. 2017).

Expanding this research to include a larger number of ARs (i.e.
those sampled after 2014) will allow us to make further infer-
ences about IRIS bursts in the future.
