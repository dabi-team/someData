Abstract  –  The  Sariçiçek  howardite  meteorite  shower  consisting  of  343  documented  stones 

occurred on 2 September 2015 in Turkey and is the first documented howardite fall. Cosmogenic 

isotopes show that Sariçiçek experienced a complex cosmic ray exposure history, exposed during 

~12–14 Ma in a regolith near the surface of a parent asteroid, and that an ~1 m sized meteoroid 

was launched by an impact 22 ± 2 Ma ago to Earth (as did one third of all HED meteorites). SIMS 

dating of zircon and baddeleyite yielded 4550.4 ± 2.5 Ma and 4553 ± 8.8 Ma crystallization ages 

for the basaltic magma clasts. The apatite U-Pb age of 4525 ± 17 Ma, K-Ar age of ~3.9 Ga, and 

the U,Th-He ages of 1.8 ± 0.7 and 2.6 ± 0.3 Ga are interpreted to represent thermal metamorphic 

and  impact-related  resetting  ages,  respectively.  Petrographic,  geochemical  and  O-,  Cr-  and  Ti-

isotopic studies confirm that Sariçiçek belongs to the normal clan of HED meteorites. Petrographic 

observations and analysis of organic material indicate a small portion of carbonaceous chondrite 

material in the Sariçiçek regolith and organic contamination of the meteorite after a few days on 

soil.  Video  observations  of  the  fall  show  an  atmospheric  entry  at  17.3  ±  0.8  kms-1  from  NW, 

fragmentations at 37, 33, 31 and 27 km altitude, and provide a pre-atmospheric orbit that is the 

first dynamical link between the normal HED meteorite clan and the inner Main Belt. Spectral data 

indicate the similarity of Sariçiçek with the Vesta asteroid family (V-class) spectra, a group of 

asteroids  stretching  to  delivery  resonances,  which  includes  (4)  Vesta.  Dynamical  modeling  of 

meteoroid delivery to Earth shows  that the complete disruption of a ~1 km sized Vesta family 

asteroid or a ~10 km sized impact crater on Vesta is required to provide sufficient meteoroids ≤4 

m in size to account for the influx of meteorites from this HED clan. The 16.7 km diameter Antonia 

impact crater on Vesta was formed on terrain of the same age as given by the 4He retention age of 

Sariçiçek. Lunar scaling for crater production to crater counts of its ejecta blanket show it was 

formed ~22 Ma ago.

INTRODUCTION 

The  link  from  asteroid  (4)  Vesta  to  howardite-eucrite-diogenite  (HED)  meteorites  has  been 

thoroughly covered in the literature since the work by McCord et al. (1970) demonstrated a shared 

(V-class) visible-to-near-infrared spectrum. Since that time, studies of HED's petrographical and 

geochemical properties support an origin from a Vesta-like protoplanet (e.g., Consolmagno and 

Drake 1977; Mittlefehldt 2015). More recently, the Dawn mission (especially the Gamma Ray and 

Neutron Detector instrument spectroscopic results of Prettyman et al. 2015), further cemented the 

link  between  the  main  group  (normal)  HEDs  and  Vesta  by  showing  good  agreement  in  the 

concentration of K and Th within Vesta's regolith to that of eucrite-rich howardites.  

Most  normal  HED  meteorites  fall  from  0.1  to  4  m  sized  meteoroids  that  were  excavated  in  an 

impact in the last ~100 Ma. The cosmic-ray exposure age distribution of HED meteorites is broad 

(Eugster  and  Michel  1995),  meaning  more  than  one  collision  is  responsible  for  the  meteorites 

collected at Earth. However, about one-third of all measured non-anomalous HED meteorites have 

a distinct cosmic-ray exposure age of 22 Ma (Llorca et al. 2009; Welten et al. 2012; Cartwright et 

al. 2014).   

The source crater of the 22 Ma clan of HED meteorites remains to be identified. That impact may 

have occurred on Vesta itself. Now Dawn has visited Vesta and mapped in detail a great many 

craters; efforts have begun to date the most recently formed craters using crater size-frequency 

distributions on their ejecta blankets. Because the population of small impactors is unknown in the 

asteroid belt, two different chronology systems have been developed that result in different age 

estimates (O'Brien et al. 2014; Schedemann et al. 2014).  

Alternatively, the impact may have involved the disruption of one of the larger members of Vesta's 

associated asteroid family (the Vestoids), which likely originated from the impacts that formed the 

Rheasilvia impact basin and the smaller and partially overlapping (older) Veneneia impact basin 

(Marchi et al. 2012, Ivanov and Melosh 2013). Astronomers studying the Vesta asteroid family in 

the  1990's  demonstrated  that  the  distribution  of  V-class  asteroids  stretches  to  the  3:1  delivery 

resonance that can bring V-class asteroids to near-Earth orbit (e.g., Cruikshank et al. 1991; Binzel 

5 

 
et al. 2002). The much smaller HED meteoroids are more affected by radiation-driven forces and 

may  follow  a  different  pathway,  a  pathway  that  can  only  be  probed  from  the  arrival  orbits  of 

documented HED falls. 

Not all HED meteorites originate from Vesta or its asteroid family. There is a group of isotopically 

anomalous eucrites (Sanborn and Yin 2014; Mittlefehldt 2015; Sanborn et al. 2016). One example 

is the meteorite Bunburra Rockhole (Bland et al. 2009; Benedix et al. 2017), the only documented 

HED  fall  with  precise  orbital  information  (Spurny  et  al.  2012).  Bunburra  Rockhole  is  an 

anomalous eucrite with isotopic signatures suggesting it originated from a different source than 

most HED meteorites (Bland et al. 2009; Benedix et al. 2017).  

Well documented HED falls are important also because they shed light on the damage caused by 

larger Vestoid impacts on Earth. These basaltic achondrites represent a distinctly different type of 

material than ordinary chondrites. Only ~4% of the 20 m to 2 km sized near-Earth asteroids in 

danger  of  impacting  Earth  are  of  V-class,  but  half  would  have  relatively  high  entry  speed  and 

impact energies of 1–1000 Mt (Reddy et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2016).  

On 2 September, 2015, an eucrite-rich howardite fell in Turkey. Here, we present results from a 

consortium study of what proved to be the first documented normal-clan HED meteorite fall. We 

determined  the  approach  trajectory  and  orbit  of  the  meteoroid,  its  size  and  impact  speed,  and 

studied a few of the recovered meteorites in great detail to determine its material properties and 

collisional history. In this paper, we will focus on results that further the study of the impact risk 

and the search for the normal 22 Ma clan HED source crater.  

METHODS 

A bolide of ~0.13 kT initial kinetic energy was detected by U.S. Government satellite sensors at 

+39.1ºN and 40.2ºE, near the town of Bingöl, Turkey, at 20:10:30 UTC on September 2, 2015 

(https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs).  Small  meteorites  fell  on  corrugated  roofs  in  the  nearby 

village of Sariçiçek. "Sariçiçek" (Turkish for "Yellow-Flower") is now the official name of the 

meteorite (Bouvier et al. 2016).  

Field study of the fall 

6 

 
A field expedition to the area was conducted by the University of Istanbul and Bingöl University 

on Sep. 29 – October 4, 2015. Video camera recordings and data from seismic sensors in the area 

were  used  to  reconstruct  the  meteor  trajectory  and  its  airburst.  The  bolide's  entry  speed  and 

direction  were  derived  from  direct  imaging  of  the  meteor  and  shadows  cast  using  techniques 

described in Popova et al. (2013) and Borovicka et al. (2013). From all available video security 

footage, seven sites were selected that offered the best calibration opportunities (Table 1), with 

three redundant sites at Bingöl University and Muş Alparslan University to recognize systematic 

errors,  and  two  sites  at  Kiği  and  Karliova  that  offered  a  perpendicular  perspective  to  the  line 

connecting Bingöl and Muş (Fig. 1). This provided six independent pairs of perspectives, from 

which the uncertainty in the direction of the trajectory and entry speed was determined. 

For  calibration,  suitable  sun-shadow  images  were  obtained  from  those  same  video  cameras  at 

different times in the day. The height of shadow obstacles was measured in the field. In addition, 

calibration images were taken with a digital camera, from the perspective of the video security 

cameras, with a number of 50 cm markers scattered in the field of view to assist the correction for 

perspective. The shadow of the Bingöl rectorate building was traced (Fig. 1A), with azimuth angles 

of the front tip of the shadow measured relative to the position under the tip of the overhanging 

building.  At  the  soccer  court,  the  shadow  of  a  fence  was  traced  (Fig.  1B).  Uncertainty  in 

determining  the  exact  position  on  the  ground  below  the  lamp  head  at  the  third  site  in  Bingöl 

University  (Fig.  1C)  proved  responsible  for  a  small  systematic  error  of  ‒3º  azimuth  and  +1.2º 

elevation compared to the other two sites.  

Muş Alparslan was far enough from the trajectory to capture the final part of the meteor itself in 

two videos. The foreground in one street-view scene (Fig. 1D) has significant perspective with 

nearby buildings and distant lights, and required only a small warp to remove the lens distortions. 

Star-background  images  were  taken  with  the  digital  camera  just  in  front  of  the  video  security 

camera,  providing  a  good  match  to  foreground  features.  Stars  aligned  to  a  precision  of  1.6’ 

observed-calculated (O-C). Before the meteor itself entered the frame, video frames were recorded 

only  every  0.17s,  making  the  earlier  illumination  of  the  landscape  less  suitable  for  light  curve 

reconstruction.  Camera  #64    (Fig.  1E)  reproduced  the  star  field  to  5.4’  O-C,  but  the  observed 

7 

 
images of the meteor were in fact internal reflections in the camera or camera housing, not a direct 

image of the meteor itself. This was confirmed by a third site at Muş based on shadows from a 

lantern pole (Fig. 1F). 

Photographs of the building in Kiği (Fig. 1H) from different viewpoints, as well as the height of 

the  shadow  obstacle  in  Karliova,  were  provided  by  the  Bingöl  video  security  center.  The 

photographs  helped  determine  the  ground-projected  point  below  the  building's  roof  tip.  In 

calibrating the depth scale at Kiği, we took into account that the street slopes down in a direction 

away from the camera. 

At the meteorite fall site near Sariçiçek, a grid search (within the survey bands marked in Fig. 5 

below) was conducted perpendicular to the trajectory in the densest part of the meteorite strewn 

field.  Following  this  demonstration,  local  inhabitants  of  Sariçiçek  (led  by  Nezir  Ergun)  with 

assistance from Bingöl University staff tracked new meteorite recoveries and collected positional 

information. In total, 343 meteorites were documented (Table 2).  

Analysis of the meteorites 

Several meteorites were made available for this study. Figure 2 shows Sariçiçek samples SC12 

and  SC14,  which  are  the  main  focus  of  the  work  presented  here.  Samples  were  broken  and 

fragments  of  each  stone  were  distributed  to  the  international  community  of  researchers 

participating in this consortium study. Additional samples of Sariçiçek became available later and 

were used for comparison studies (last column of Table 2). In the remainder of this section, the 

methods used for each analysis are described in the order in which results are later presented. 

At  NASA  Ames  Research  Center  in  Moffett  Field,  California,  first  a  small  tip  of  SC12  was 

removed for classification (sample SC12a). Subsequently, the bulk volume density of SC12b and 

whole  stone  SC14  were  determined  using  a  NextEngine  3D  laser  scanner.  The  samples  were 

rotated eight times for a full 360° image, taking 3300 polygons per rotation. The measurement was 

repeated after rotating the sample 90° to scan the poles, and all were aligned for a full 3D image 

the grain volume densities were determined with a Quantachrome gas pycnometer, using nitrogen.

Next, SC12 (SC12b) and SC14 were broken to distribute samples in the consortium (Fig. 2). At 

NASA Ames, the quasistatic compression strength was measured in unconfined compression at 

~6 MPas‒1 (load rate of 33 Ns‒1), using a SouthWark-Emery Tensile Machine to measure the load 

at which uncut meteorites developed the first crack. SC12 failed at a load of 218 kg (480 lbs). 

SC14 already failed at a load of 100 kg (220 lbs), but was further compressed to a load of 530 kg 

(1170 lbs), creating more fragments (Fig. 2). Aluminum foil between meteorite and press was used 

to determine the surface area. In the same manner, at the Geology Department of the University of 

Istanbul,  Turkey,  other  meteorites  (SC50,  54,  57  and  239)  were  broken  using  a  Yüksel  Kaya 

Makina press (model YKM071 and press390 software by Teknodinamik Co.) and a load rate of 

100 Ns‒1 

At the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (New Mexico Tech.) in Socorro, New 

Mexico, small samples of SC12 and SC14 were cut into nominal 5 x 5 x 5 mm cubes. These are 

smaller than the 10 x 10 x 10 mm samples  typically employed, but in this case the material was 

fine grained and cracked on a small scale. Sample SC14 broke in the final preparation step, but 

sample SC12 was suitable for measurement. The sample was compressed to failure at a constant 

displacement rate of 0.01 mms‒1 (corresponding strain rate 2x10-3 s‒1) using a MTS Landmark 

Load Frame. Images of the sample were recorded during compression to track the evolution of 

failure in the sample. 

The larger Sariçiçek sub-samples of SC12 (SC12b) and SC14 were imaged with high-resolution 

X-ray computed tomography at the Center for Molecular and Genomic Imaging of the University 

of California Davis. Each sample arrived with a small fragment broken off (SC12b-a1 and SC12b-

a2). SC14-a1 was further broken into two equal pieces that were aligned and imaged together. X-

ray tomographic images were obtained on a MicroXCT-200 specimen CT scanner (Carl Zeiss X-

ray Microscopy). The CT scanner has a variable X-ray source capable of a voltage range of 20–90 

kV with 1–8 W of power. Once the source and detector settings were established, the optimal X-

ray filtration was determined by selecting among one of 12 proprietary filters for optimal contrast 

(90 kV and 88 microAmp). 1600 projections were obtained over a 360° rotation. The camera pixels 

were binned by 2 to increase signal to noise in the image and the source-detector configuration 

9 

 
resulted in a voxel size of 28.3 µm for SC12b-a1, 20.3 µm for SC14-a1, and 5.5 µm for SC12b-a2 

and SC14-a2.  

The  distribution  of  fracture  lengths  was  measured  from  the  microCT  images  using  the  ImageJ 

software and the Ride Detection plugin (Steger 1998). Fractures are planes. Each microCT scan 

provided multiple two-dimensional views of the fractures. We assume that fracturing follows the 

Weibull distribution (Weibull 1951), that they are randomly distributed through the target, and that 

the likelihood of encountering a fracture increases with distance. This results in a relationship: 

sl = ss(ns/nl)α   

where ss and sl refers to stress in the small and large object, ns and nl refer to the number of cracks 

per unit volume of the small and large object, and α is the shape parameter called the Weibull 

coefficient.  A  relationship  exists  between  the  distributions  of  measured  trace  length  and  actual 

fracture plane size (Piggott 1997), where the slope of a log‒log plot of trace length versus fracture 

density is proportional to α. The value for α remains mostly unknown in meteorites (Asphaug et 

al. 2002), while terrestrial rocks like concrete, granite and basalt have an α of ~0.20, ~0.16 and 

~0.11, respectively.  

Petrographic analyses of the small tip broken from sample SC12 and of a subsample of the broken 

SC14 were carried out using the Cameca SX100 electron microprobe at the E-beam laboratory of 

the  Astromaterials  and  Exploration  Science  (ARES)  Division,  NASA  Johnson  Space  Center  in 

Houston, Texas. A 15 kV focused beam was used, and the following natural mineral standards: 

kaersutite, chromite, rutile, apatite, rhodonite, troilite, orthoclase and oligoclase. Pure metals were 

used as standards for Ni and Co. 

At the Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences of the University of Munich, Germany, 

analyses of sample SC182 were carried out using a Cameca SX100 electron microprobe. It was 

operated at 15 keV acceleration voltage and 20 nA beam current.  Synthetic wollastonite (Ca), 

natural olivine (Fe in silicates, Mg, Si), hematite (Fe in oxides, metals and sulfides), corundum 

(Al),  natural  ilmenite  (Mn),  fluorapatite  (P),  orthoclase  (K),  sphalerite  (S),  synthetic  NiO  (Ni), 

10 

 
synthetic Cr2O3 (Cr) and albite (Na) were used as standards. A matrix correction was performed 

by using the PAP procedure (Pouchou and Pichoir 1984).  

At the Ural Federal University in Ekaterinburg, Russian Federation, a search of xenolithic clasts 

in a thin section of SC181 was conducted under normal and polarized light using an Axiovert 40 

MAT  microscope,  and  by  Scanning  Electron  Microscopy  (SEM)  analysis  using  an  Auriga 

CrossBeam SEM with an X-max 80 energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) device (Oxford 

Instruments). At Istanbul University, a thin section of SC18 was studied with a Leitz OrthoplanPol 

optical  microscope,  while  SC18  was  studied  by  SEM  at  Namik  Kemal  University  in  Merkez, 

Turkey. And at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, a small fragment of SC239 was studied using 

a Horiba LabRam HR Evolution micro-Raman system, with He-Ne laser excitation at 632.8 nm, 

spectral  resolution  1.5  cm-1,  and  spot  size  0.85  micrometer.  Spectra  were  collected  with  an 

acquisition time of 20 s, 10 accumulations, and laser power ~4 mW.  

The  next  analysis  techniques  pertain  to  composition  measurements  and  are  described  in  more 

detail. At the University of California at Davis, fusion crust free material was selected from several 

small ~0.1g fragments of SC12b. A subsample of the crushed, homogenized powder (40.21 mg) 

was placed into a PTFE Parr bomb along with a mixture of ultraclean concentrated HF and HNO3 

acids in a 3:1 ratio. The PTFE bomb was sealed in a stainless steel jacket and heated in a 190°C 

oven for 96 h to ensure complete dissolution of refractory phases. After 96 h, the resulting solution 

was  dried  down  and  treated  with  alternating  treatments  of  concentrated  HNO3 and  6  N  HCl  to 

dissolve any fluorides formed during the dissolution procedure.  The resulting sample solution was 

divided into two aliquots: one for major/minor/trace bulk composition measurements (10% of the 

sample),  and  the  other  for  Cr  isotopic  analysis  (90%  of  the  sample).  The  aliquot  for  the 

major/minor/trace bulk composition measurements was brought up in a 2% HNO3 solution and 

prepared in two dilutions (2000´ for trace elements and 40000´  for major elements). The sample 

solutions and calibration standard solutions were spiked with an internal standard composed of Re, 

In, and Bi to account for drift in the mass spectrometer during the analytical session. As a result, 

we do not report Re, In and Bi in the meteorite samples. A calibration curve, a fit line of counts 

per second versus concentration R2 = 0.999 or better was generated for each element using the 

11 

 
well-characterized Allende Smithsonian standard reference material to determine abundances of 

individual elements of Sariçiçek. A separate aliquot of the CM chondrite Murchison was measured 

as an unknown to check for accuracy during the analytical session. Both Allende and Murchison 

were  processed  using  the  same  dissolution  and  dilution  procedures  as  the  Sariçiçek  sample. 

Measurements  were  made  using  a  Thermo  Element  XR  high-resolution  inductively  coupled 

plasma‒mass  spectrometer  (HR-ICP-MS)  at  UC  Davis,  at  the  low,  medium  or  high  resolution 

needed for a particular element. 

At Fordham University in Bronx, New York, bulk chemical analysis was conducted on chips and 

powder  of  SC14.  The  material  was  separated  into  five  individual  aliquots  for  replicate 

measurements. The mass (mg) of each aliquot are as follows: (n = 5, 137.9, 115.5, 106.4, 106.1, 

and 92.1).  Dissolution and inductively coupled plasma‒mass spectrometry (ICPMS) analyses are 

based on a matrix-matching scheme (Friedrich et al. 2003; Wolf et al. 2012). In short, each sample 

aliquot was ground to <100 mesh in a clean agate mortar and pestle. Those powders were placed 

in Teflon bombs with 1 mL HF and 5 mL HNO3 and placed in a microwave digestion system. The 

resulting solution is taken to incipient dryness in Teflon beakers on a specially constructed drybath 

incubator at 75 °C. HClO4 is then added and again the solution is taken to incipient dryness at 75 

°C. The samples are then taken up to a total of 50 mL of ~1% HNO3 solution after adding internal 

standards  (Be,  Rh,  In,  Tl)  used  to  correct  for  potential  mass-dependent  drift  during  ICP-MS 

analysis. These solutions were used for trace element analysis; fivefold dilutions of portions of 

those solutions were used for major element analyses akin to the method of Wolf et al. (2012). A 

Thermo Scientific X Series II ICP-MS was used for all analyses. During ICP-MS analysis, the 

Allende Standard Reference Meteorite (Jarosewich et al. 1987), USGS basaltic standards BIR-1 

and BCR-1, and the NIST 688 basalt standard were used for an external calibration scheme for 

quantification of the individual elemental analytes. Standards and procedural blanks were digested 

using the same method outlined above.  

Two  samples  of  Sariçiçek,  SC12b  and  SC14,  were  analyzed  for  triple  oxygen  isotopes  at  the 

University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The two samples were gently crushed with a mortar 

and pestle. A few fragments of interior material were selected under a stereoscopic microscope to 

12 

 
avoid any possible contamination from fusion crust. The bulk fragments were pretreated by an 

acid-wash with weak HCl and subsequent rinsing in distilled water (removal of possible terrestrial 

weathering products). One portion of SC14 was not acid-treated, and several subsamples of this 

portion  were  also  analyzed.  Two  large  feldspar  (plagioclase)  grains  were  picked  from  SC14. 

Oxygen  isotope  analyses  of  several  subsamples  of  the  two  stones  were  performed  by  laser 

fluorination at UNM (Sharp 1990). Samples were pre-fluorinated (BrF5) in a vacuum chamber in 

order to clean the stainless steel system and to react residual traces of water or air in the fluorination 

chamber. Molecular oxygen was released from the samples by laser-assisted fluorination (20W 

far-infrared CO2 laser) in a BrF5-atmosphere, producing molecular O2 and solid fluorides. Excess 

BrF5 was then removed from the produced O2 by reaction with hot NaCl. The oxygen was purified 

by freezing onto a 13Å molecular sieve at ‒196°C, followed by elution of the O2 from the first 

sieve  at  ~300  °C  (heat  gun)  into  a  He-stream  that  carries  the  oxygen  through  a  CG  column 

(separation of O2 and NF3, a possible interference with the  17O measurement) to a second 13Å 

molecular sieve at −196°C. After removal of the He, the O2 is then released directly into a dual 

inlet  isotope  ratio  mass  spectrometer  (Thermo  Finnigan  MAT  253).  The  oxygen  isotope  ratios 

were  calibrated  against  the  isotopic  composition  of  San  Carlos  olivine.  Each  sample  analysis 

consisted of 20 cycles of sample-standard comparison. Olivine standards (~1‒2 mg) were analyzed 

daily. Oxygen isotopic ratios were calculated using the following procedure: The δ18O values refer 

to  the  per-mil  deviation  in  a  sample  (18O/16O)  from  SMOW,  expressed  as  δ18O  = 

[(18O/16O)sample/(18O/16O)SMOW‒1] * 103. The delta values were converted to linearized values by 

calculating: δ18/17O’ = ln([δ18/17O + 103]/103) * 103 in order to create straightline mass-fractionation 

curves. The δ17O’ values were obtained from the linear δ–values by the following relationship: 

δ17O’ = δ17O’ – 0.528 * δ18O’, Δ17O’ values of zero define the terrestrial mass-fractionation line, 

and  Δ17O’  values  deviating  from  zero  indicate  mass-independent  isotope  fractionation.  Typical 

analytical precision of the laser fluorination technique is better than ± 0.02‰ for Δ17O’.  

At the University of California Davis, bulk rock powders were generated from a fusion crust free 

portion of a subsample of Sariçiçek SC12 and the howardite Bholghati by crushing in an agate 

mortar and pestle. The bulk rock powders were homogenized and an aliquot of 40.21 mg and 15.24 

mg were taken of the Sariçiçek and Bholghati powders, respectively. The powders were combined 

13 

 
with a 3:1 solution mixture of concentrated HF and HNO3 and sealed in PTFE Parr bomb capsules 

within  stainless  steel  jackets.  The  Parr  bombs  were  heated  in  a  190  °C  oven  for  4  days.  After 

dissolution  was  complete,  the  solutions  were  dried  down,  acid-treated  with  6  M  HCl  and 

concentrated HNO3 to remove fluorides, then brought up in 1 mL of 6 M HCl. Chromium was 

separated using a three-column chromatography following a procedure described by Yamakawa 

et al. (2009). The isotopic composition of the purified Cr separate was determined using a Thermo 

Triton Plus thermal ionization mass spectrometer at UC Davis. A total of 3 μg of Cr was combined 

with 3 µl of an Al-boric acid-silica gel activator solution and loaded onto an outgassed W filament. 

A total of four filaments were prepared for each sample (total Cr load of 12 μg). Each set of four 

sample filaments were bracketed with two filaments before and after loaded with the NIST SRM 

979  terrestial chromium isotopic standard, prepared in the same manner and with the same Cr load 

as  the  samples.  Each  filament  analysis  was  made  up  of  1200  ratio  measurements  with  an  8  s 

integration time. A gain calibration was performed at the start of each filament and a baseline was 

measured every 25 ratios. The amplifiers were rotated between each 25-ratio block to eliminate 

any  bias  due  to  differing  cup  efficiencies.  Instrumental  mass  fractionation  was  made  using  the 

50Cr/52Cr ratio (50Cr/52Cr = 0.051859; Shields et al. 1966) and corrected using the exponential law. 

The signal intensity for 52Cr was set to 10 V (±15%) for the duration of the run. 

At ETH Zürich, Switzerland, high precision Ti isotope data were obtained using an ion exchange 

procedure for Ti separation from the sample matrix followed by measurements on a Neptune MC-

ICP-MS.  The  analytical  method  follows  that  of  Williams  (2015)  with  a  modification  based  on 

Zhang et al. (2011). In brief, two subsamples (SC14-Z1 and SC14-Z3) were crushed and dissolved 

using the Parr Bomb digestion procedure described in Schönbächler et al. (2004). For the first step 

of the chemical separation, the procedure of Zhang et al. (2011) using TODGA resin was adapted. 

This was followed by an ion exchange column using anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad AG1-X8), in 

which the samples are loaded in 4 M HF, followed by matrix elution in 4 M HF, 0.5 M HCl + 0.5 

M HF and the collection of Ti in 6 M HCl + 1M HF (Schönbächler et al. 2004; Williams 2015). 

This column was carried out twice to achieve an improved Ti separation from interfering elements 

such as Ca, Cr and V. Blanks for the Parr Bomb digestion were 0.69 ng Ti and for the column 

chemistry  6.65  ng  Ti.  Considering  the  total  Ti  amount  in  the  sample  (>  20  μg),  the  blanks  are 

14 

 
negligible. The isotopic analyses were performed on a Neptune MC-ICP-MS and corrections for 

isobaric interferences from Ca, Cr and V on Ti isotopes were applied. The samples were bracketed 

by  an  ETH  in-house  Ti  wire  standard  solution.  Each  analysis  consisted  of  one  block  with  40 

integrations of 8.39 s for the main and 4.19 s for the second cycle. On-peak background correction 

was  applied  and  samples  were  analysed  in  medium-  and  high-resolution  mode.  The  measured 

ratios were internally normalized to 49Ti/47Ti =0.749766 (Niederer et al. 1981) and are reported in 

the epsilon notation (the deviation from the Ti wire standard expressed in parts per 104).  

In addition to the Sariçiçek samples processed at ETH Zürich, a separate aliquot was processed at 

UC Davis.  The aliquot was the same sample from which Cr was previously separated.  The column 

separation  and  mass  spectrometry  followed  the  procedures  described  in  Zhang  et  al.  (2011). 

Titanium isotope ratios were measured on the Thermo Neptune Plus ICP-MS at UC Davis. 

At  NASA  Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  in  Greenbelt,  Maryland,  two  separate  amino  acid 

measurements were made of a ~155 mg aliquot of a crushed fragment of SC12 and a 1.72 g aliquot 

of SC14. As controls, a 150 mg sample of a pebble collected from the fall location of SC14 and an 

830 mg sample of soil collected from the fall location of the Sariçiçek SC16 meteorite were also 

extracted and analyzed for amino acids. The SC12 meteorite sample and SC14 recovery site pebble 

were powdered separately in a ceramic mortar and pestle, transferred to a borosilicate glass test 

tube, flame-sealed with 1 ml of Millipore Milli-Q Integral 10 (18.2 MΩ, < 1 ppb total organic 

carbon) ultrapure water and heated at 100 °C for 24 h. The soil sample was fine-grained and did 

not need to be powdered prior to hot water extraction. A procedural blank (glass tube with 1 ml 

Millipore water) was carried through the identical extraction protocol. After heating, one half of 

the water extract was transferred to a separate glass tube, dried under vacuum, and the residue 

subjected  to  a  6  M  HCl  acid  vapor  hydrolysis  procedure  at  150  °C  for  3  h  to  determine  total 

hydrolyzable amino acid content. The acid-hydrolyzed water extracts were desalted using cation-

exchange  resin  (AG50W-X8,  100‒200  mesh,  hydrogen  form,  BIO-RAD),  and  the  amino  acids 

recovered by elution with 2 M NH4OH (prepared from Millipore water and NH3(g) (AirProducts, 

in vacuo). The remaining half of each water extract (non-hydrolyzed fraction) was taken through 

the identical desalting procedure in parallel with the acid-hydrolyzed extracts to determine the free 

15 

 
amino acid abundances in the meteorites and soil sample. The amino acids in the NH4OH eluates 

were dried under vacuum to remove excess ammonia; the residues were then redissolved in 100 

µl of Millipore water, transferred to sterile microcentrifuge tubes, and stored at ‒20°C prior to 

analysis. Based on our analysis of amino acid standards taken through the entire extraction and 

acid hydrolysis procedure, we found no evidence of significant decomposition, racemization, or 

thermal degradation of the amino acids during the extraction procedure. The amino acids in the 

NH4OH eluates were derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde/N-acetyl-L-cysteine (OPA/NAC) for 15 

min at room temperature. The abundance, distribution, and enantiomeric compositions of the two- 

to  six-carbon  aliphatic  amino  acids  present  in  the  non-hydrolyzed  and  acid-hydrolyzed  water 

extracts of SC12 and controls were then determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography 

fluorescence detection and time of flight mass spectrometry (hereafter LC-FD/ToF-MS) using a 

Waters  ACQUITY  H  Class  UPLC  with  fluorescence  detector  and  Waters  Xevo  G2  XS.  The 

instrument parameters and analy<tical conditions used were similar to those described elsewhere 

(Glavin et al. 2006, 2010).  For the Xevo mass calibrations, an automatically applied lockmass of 

a fragment of Leucine Enkephalin (278.1141 Da) with a scan time of 1 s every 60 s is used. The 

capillary voltage was set to 1.2 kV. The amino acids and their enantiomeric ratios were quantified 

from the peak areas generated from both fluorescence detection and from the mass chromatogram 

of their OPA/NAC derivatives as described previously (Glavin et al. 2006). The reported amino 

acid abundances in the Sariçiçek SC12 meteorite sample and controls below are the average value 

of  three  separate  LC-FD/ToF-MS  measurements.  The  errors  given  are  based  on  the  standard 

deviation of the average value of three separate measurements.  

The concentrations of short-lived cosmogenic radionuclides, as well as long-lived cosmogenic 26Al 

and  natural  radioactivity,  were  measured  using  non-destructive  gamma  ray  spectroscopy.  The 

complete stone SC26 (131.88g) was measured in the STELLA (SubTErranean LowLevel Assay) 

facility of underground laboratories at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy, 

using a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector of 370 cm3 (Arpesella 1996). The counting time 

was 7.8 days. The counting efficiencies were calculated using a Monte Carlo code. This code was 

validated through measurements and analyses of samples of well-known radionuclide activities 

and geometries. The uncertainties in the radionuclide activities are dominated by the uncertainty 

16 

 
in the counting efficiency, which is conservatively estimated at 10%. The density and composition 

were taken from the measurements performed on other specimens of this meteorite and presented 

in this paper.  

For the analysis of the long-lived cosmogenic radionuclides 10Be (half-life = 1.36 ´ 106 yr), 26Al 

(half-life = 7.05 ´ 105 yr) and 36Cl (half-life = 3.01 ´ 105 yr), samples of 52.0 and 58.5 mg of SC12 

and SC14 were dissolved in a mixture of concentrated HF/HNO3 along with ~2.8 mg of Be and 

~3.6 mg of Cl carrier. After dissolution, Cl was isolated as AgCl, and the remaining solution was 

evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in dilute HCl and a small aliquot was taken for 

chemical analysis by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using 

an iCAP 6300 instrument. The elements Mg, Al, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni were analysed.  

After measuring the Al content of the dissolved sample, we added 5.0 and 5.4 mg of Al carrier to 

the  main  solution  of  SC12  and  SC14,  respectively.  We  separated  Be  and  Al  using  procedures 

described previously (e.g., Welten et al. 2001, 2012) and measured the concentrations of 10Be, 26Al 

and 36Cl by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana 

(Sharma et al. 2000). The measured  10Be/Be,  26Al/Al and  36Cl/Cl ratios are corrected for blank 

levels (which are <1% of the measured values) and normalized to AMS standards (Sharma et al. 

1990; Nishiizumi 2004; Nishiizumi et al. 2007). 

At the Helmholtz Zentrum München, Germany, an extract of SC12 for negative mode electrospray 

Fourier  transform  ion  cyclotron  resonance  mass  spectrometry  (ESI(-)-FT-ICR-MS,  12  Tesla) 

analysis was prepared as described previously in Schmitt-Kopplin et al. (2012). Briefly, an intact 

fragment of about 80 mg weight was first washed with methanol (rapid contact with 1 ml methanol 

that  was  subsequently  discarded)  and  immediately  crushed  in  an  agate  mortar  with  0.5  mL  of 

LC/MS grade methanol and further transferred into an Eppendorf tube within an ultrasonic bath 

for  1  min.  The  tube  was  then  centrifuged  for  3  min.  The  supernatant  (methanolic  extract)  was 

directly  used  for  infusion  FT-ICR-MS.  Three  thousand  scans  were  accumulated  with  4  million 

data points. The conversion of the exact masses into elementary composition is based on exact 

mass differences and shown in more detail in Tziotis et al. (2011). The average mass resolution 

ranged near 1,000,000 at nominal mass 200, 400,000 at mass 400 and 300,000 at mass 600. Prior 

17 

 
the sample extraction, great care was used to clean the agate pillar with solvent in ultrasonic bath. 

A “blank” sample was produced by following the same extraction procedure without any meteorite 

fragment, and analysed before and after the meteorite analysis. No significant mass peaks in the 

mass range of the meteorite extract were observed. In order to fully exploit the advantages of FT-

ICR-MS,  we  routinely  control  the  instrument  performance  by  means  of  external  calibration  on 

arginine clusters prior to any analysis. Relative m/z errors were usually < 100 ppb across a range 

of 150 < m/z < 1,500.  

At ETH Zurich, noble gases were measured in two samples of SC12 (SC12-Z1 and SC12-Z2) with 

masses of 44.6 and 92.0 mg, respectively, and two samples of SC14 (SC14-Z2.1 and SC14-Z2.2) 

with masses of 32.5 and 19.7 mg, respectively. Samples were weighed (uncertainty <0.05 mg), 

wrapped into Al-foil and loaded into a custom-built single-collector sector-field noble gas mass 

spectrometer equipped with a Baur‒Signer source. The samples were then exposed to ultra-high 

(~10-10 mbar) vacuum for about 2 weeks, before being analyzed according to a protocol described 

by Meier et al. (2017). Blank contributions to the total signal were negligible (<0.02%) for all He, 

Ne, and <2% for Ar isotopes. 

Before in-situ U-Pb analysis, datable minerals were searched in a polished section of Sariçiçek 

meteorite SC12a polished mounts. Backscattered electron (BSE) images were obtained by the field 

emission  scanning  electron  microscope  (FESEM)  of  Carl  Zeiss  SUPRA-55  at  the  National 

Astronomical Observatories (NAO), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing, China. U-

bearing mineral grains, including zircon, baddeleyite, and apatite, were identified and located with 

an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Cathodoluminescence and corresponding BSE images 

for  zircon  grains  were  taken  by  a  Nova  NanoSEM  FESEM  at  the  Institute  of  Geology  and 

Geophysics (IGG), CAS, in Beijing. 

Subsequently,  micro-Raman  spectra  were  taken  of  the  identified  grains  to  confirm  the  mineral 

assignments. Raman spectra were collected using a laser Raman spectrometer of Horiba LabRaM 

HR800 connected to a Olympus BX41 microscope at IGG, CAS. The 532 nm wavelength of a 

solid-state  laser  was  used,  with  the  beam  focused  on  a  ~1  micrometer  spot.  The  laser  Raman 

18 

 
spectrometer was calibrated to the peak at 520 cm‒1 with a single-crystal silicon standard. Raman 

spectral mapping scanned from 120 to 800 cm‒1, covering the characteristic peaks of baddeleyite. 

In-situ isotopic analysis of U-Pb was performed on a large-geometry, double-focusing secondary 

ion mass spectrometer, CAMECA IMS-1280HR ion microprobe at the Institute of Geology and 

Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. A polished section of the SC12 was carbon-

coated prior to SIMS analysis. U-Pb dating for zircon and baddeleyite in Sariçiçek was conducted 

with a small primary beam of O‒ with a diameter of ~ 4 × 5 μm under dynamic multi-collector 

mode,  slightly  modified  from  procedure  of  Liu  et  al.  (2015).  The  analytical  method  here  is 

described only briefly. The “oxygen flooding technique” with a working O2 gas pressure of 4~5 

´10‒6  Torr  was  used  to  greatly  enhance  Pb  ion  yield  and  suppress  the  baddeleyite  crystal 

orientation effect (Wingate and Compston 2000; Li et al. 2010). The primary ion beam of O‒ was 

accelerated at ‒13 kV potential, with an intensity of ~ 0.8 nA. Mass resolving power is set at 8000 

(50% peak height definition). Before analysis, each spot was pre-sputtered using a ~ 3 nA primary 

beam on a square area of 25×25 μm2 for 120 s to remove the surface contamination and to enhance 

the  secondary  ions  yield.  For  zircon  and  baddeleyite  analyses,  we  used  the  207Pb/206Pb  ratio  of 

M257 zircon standard to calibrate the EM yields. The data acquisition includes five sequences. 

The 90Zr2

16O+ was measured as matrix peak. 180Hf 16O+ peak was used for peak centering. 204Pb+, 

206Pb+  and  207Pb+  were  obtained  simultaneously  during  the  third  sequence  on  L2,  L1  and  C 

detectors, and 238U+, 232Th16O+ and 238U16O+ in the fourth sequence. 238U16O2

+ was detected in the 

final sequence. Each measurement for U-Pb dating consists of seven cycles, taking nearly 14 min. 

Pb/U fractionation was calibrated with the empirically established power law relationship between 

206Pb/238U  and  238U16O2/238U  against  standard  RM  M257  (Nasdala  et  al.  2008).  Uranium 

concentrations  were  calibrated  against  zircon  M257  with  U  ~840  ppm  (Nasdala  et  al.  2008). 

Correction of common Pb was made by measuring the amount of 204Pb and the CDT Pb isotopic 

compositions (206Pb/204Pb = 9.307, 207Pb/206Pb = 1.09861, Tatsumoto et al. 1973).  

U-Pb  dating  was  performed  for  apatites  in  Sariçiçek  with  a  20  x  30  μm  beam  spot  size  under 

dynamic  multi-collector  mode  as  well.  The  O2

‒  primary  ion  beam  was  used  with  an  intensity 

between 9 and 12 nA. The detector configuration is similar to that of zircon and baddeleyite. The 

19 

 
only difference is that 40Ca3

31P2

16O2

+ peak was used as matrix peak and for peak centering, which 

was measured in the first sequence. Accurate Pb isotopic composition in NIST610 glass was used 

to calibrate the relative yields among different electron multipliers. Each measurement for apatite 

U-Pb dating consists of 10 cycles, taking nearly 18 min.  

Pb/U ratios were calibrated with a power law relationship between Pb/U and UO2/U relative to an 

apatite standard of NW-1 (1160 Ma) that comes from the same complex of Prairie Lake as that of 

the  Sano  et  al.  (1999)  apatite  standard  (PRAP).  U  concentration  is  calibrated  relative  to  the 

Durango apatite which has U ~9 ppm (Trotter and Eggins 2006). Correction of common Pb was 

made by measuring the amount of 204Pb and the CDT Pb isotopic compositions (Tatsumoto et al. 

1973).  

At  NASA  Ames  Research  Center,  the  natural  and  induced  thermoluminescence  (TL)  were 

measured using a modified Daybreak Nuclear and Medical Inc. Thermoluminescence Analyzer.  

One chip of ~40 mg was taken from Sariçiçek SC12, being greater than ~6 mm from clearly visible 

fusion  crust.  This  was  gently  crushed,  the  magnetic  fraction  removed,  and  then  gently  crushed 

again to produce ~200 µm grains. A 140 Ci 90Sr beta source was used for the irradiations in the 

determination of induced TL. Two aliquots, removed from the homogenized powder, each of 4 mg 

were measured. Natural TL is determined by the “equivalent dose” method since the anomalous 

fading prevents the use of the better (internally normalized) peak height ratio method.  The dose 

administered (calculated from 25 krad in 1987; Hasan et al. 1987) was 12.74 krad. 

At Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, reflectance spectra measurements were made 

directly  on  a  fragment  of  SC12  and  on  ground  material  taken  from  the  surface  of  this  sample. 

Before  grounding  the  sample,  any  fragments  with  fusion  crusts  were  separated,  and  only  the 

interior  portions  were  ground.  The  ground  particulate  sample  was  dry-sieved  into  three  size 

fractions: <25, <125, and 125‒500 µm. Their bidirectional UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectra were 

measured at NASA Reflectance Experiment Laboratory (RELAB) from 0.3 to 2.6 µm at every 5 

nm under the viewing geometry of 30° incidence and 0° emergence angles while each sample was 

spun at a rate of 1.5 s/rotation. Biconical Fourier transform reflectance spectra of the same samples 

were measured from 1.5 to 100 µm and were scaled to and spliced with the UV-Vis-NIR spectra 

20 

 
at 2.5 µm. Near-IR absorbance measurements were performed on meteorites numbered SC51, 55, 

239 and 327 at the University of Istanbul, Turkey. Each sample was crushed in an agate mortar 

with pestle to make fine powders. A Nicolet 6700 FT-IR Spectrometer with Nicolet NIR Smart 

Updrift unit was used, with a spectral resolution of 4 cm‒1 in the 0.9–2.5 μm wavelength region. 

For each measurement 256 scans were added. 

Finally, the fusion crust and melting properties of SC239 were analyzed at the Laboratories of the 

Institute of Physical Chemistry and Institute of Optical Materials and Technologies at Bulgarian 

Academy of Sciences, Sofia, using both SEM (JEOL 6390) and TEM (JEOL 2100). A mesh was 

placed on a set of SEM images of the crust, which was found rich in bubbles. The center of each 

bubble  was  manually  identified,  after  which  the  diameter  and  volume  of  each  bubble  was 

calculated. To improve the volume measurements, fragments of SC239 were scanned by X-ray 

computed tomography (Bruker SkyScan 1272 microtomograph). A larger fragment with fusion 

crust size 65 × 33 × 27 mm was scanned at voxel size of 4 micron, and a smaller piece with size 

1.2 × 1.0 × 0.9 mm was scanned at a voxel size of 0.4 micron. To determine the temperature at 

which the material started to melt, forming the bottom of fusion crust, one small sample of SC239 

was  studied  by  means  of  in-situ  hot  stage  optical  microscopy  (a  horizontal  optical  dilatometer 

model Misura ODLT), by heating the sample at a rate of 5º/min, up to 1593 K and observe the 

changes in the sample's morphology. 

RESULTS 

Meteoroid and Atmospheric Entry  

Trajectory and Orbit 

The results of linear trajectory reconstructions are presented in Table 3 and Fig. 3. The precision 

of the final trajectory solution was evaluated based on the range of solutions for individual pairs 

of  perspectives  and  how  the  solution  changed  when  one  of  the  stations  was  removed  from  the 

combined  least-squares  fit.  Different  station  combinations  showed  that  the  position  of  the 

21 

 
 
trajectory is uncertain by ±0.6 km for fits assuming a constant speed (an approach least sensitive 

to random measurement errors near the end of the trajectory). In that case, the direction of the 

radiant is uncertain by ±0.8º. When we, instead, assume a Jacchia-type deceleration profile along 

the  trajectory  (Jacchia  et  al.  1967),  then  the  entry  speed  is  uncertain  by  ±0.8  kms‒1.  As  a  final 

check,  the  average  speed  was  calculated  for  short  altitude-sections  of  the  trail  (assuming  no 

deceleration in each section) and the result was compared to the velocity fit from all data combined 

and found in agreement (large open circles compared to other symbols in Fig. 3), except for the 

first point based on faint shadows seen at Kiği. 

The combination of all data provides the apparent radiant position at R.A. = 276.5 ± 1.4º, Decl. = 

+59.7 ± 0.8º, near the star x-Draconis, and apparent entry speed at V∞ = 17.1 ± 0.8 kms‒1, assuming 

a Jacchia et al. (1967) decleration profile (Fig. 3). If the strongly decelerated final part of the meteor 

trajectory, captured only in the Muş Alparslan street camera, is ignored, and the speed is assumed 

constant,  instead,  then  the  best-fit  solution  is  a  constant  V∞  =  16.9  ±  0.4  kms‒1  over  the  entire 

trajectory and an apparent radiant R.A. = 276.4 ± 0.9º, Decl. = +59.6 ± 0.7º, in good agreement.  

The meteor was first detected as a faint shadow in Kiği (Fig. 1H), when it was at ~60.2 km altitude. 

Only at ~58.4 km was the roof top shadow well enough defined to give an accurate direction. The 

final fragments of the meteor were seen to fade in the Muş Alparslan street camera (Fig. 1D) when 

it penetrated to 21.3 km, with strong deceleration in the final 4–6 km, especially in the final 2 km 

of the visible flight.  

The Light Curve 

The lightcurve of the meteor is shown in Fig. 4, both as a function of time and as a function of 

altitude. The lightcurve was determined from the brightness of surfaces illuminated by the meteor. 

Pixel intensity curves (in arbitrary units, a.u.) were corrected for range to the meteor (to a standard 

distance of 100 km) and aligned vertically on a logarithmic scale as a function of time, assuming 

all  remaining  factors  that  translate  flux  to  pixel  brightness  are  multiplicative.  When  aligned  in 

altitude, instead, the light curves from individual stations do not perfectly overlap (Fig. 4). Note 

how Kiği and Karliova are slightly shifted relative to the Bingöl rectorate site and the #66 camera 

22 

 
at Muş, for example. This implies that small systematic errors are still present in the trajectory 

solution.  Taking  this  uncertainty  into  account,  we  determined  that  the  initial  fragmentation 

occurred at 36.5 ± 1.0 km altitude, followed by flares at 33.0 ± 1.0, 31.0 ± 1.2, and 27.4 ± 1.4 km 

altitude.  

The absolute brightness was calibrated against that of the Moon, casting a shadow of the roof on 

the  street  in  Kiği.  At  the  time  of  the  fireball,  the  Moon  had  an  apparent  brightness  of  ‒11.3 

magnitude, defined in the visible V Johnson pass band, with zero magnitudes corresponding to Fv 

= 3.67 ´ 10‒11 W m‒2 nm‒1 (Jenniskens 2006). The black-and-white camera pass band was broader, 

presumably covering the range of about 400–700 nm. By comparing meteor shadows to those cast 

by the Moon, it was determined that an apparent visual magnitude of ‒12.7 ± 0.7 caused the first 

roof tip shadows measured in this video (at 66 km from the meteor path). From this calibration, 

the meteor reached an absolute (at 100 km-distance) peak visual magnitude of Mv = ‒16.8 ± 0.7 (a 

peak flux of Fv = 1.9 ´ 10‒4 W m-2 nm-1). 

Meteorite Strewn Field 

Table 2 gives the assigned meteorite numbers and mass of 343 meteorites, 168 of those with find 

coordinates. For masses >10g (below which the distribution is not fully sampled), the distribution 

has a differential mass index of s = 1.77 ± 0.05 (corresponding to a magnitude size distribution 

index of c = 2.04 ± 0.09 if they would be observed as independent meteors). Most mass is in the 

larger  fragments.  That  distribution  is  more  shallow  than  that  expected  for  catastrophic 

fragmentation and steeper than expected for a collisionally relaxed distribution. The value is that 

expected for a collisional cascade, where bigger particles break up into smaller pieces, and then 

those smaller pieces become the parent of even smaller pieces, etc. (Jenniskens 2006). 

A total of 24.78 kg of documented falls has been collected, the largest fragment weighing 1.47 kg 

(Fig. 5). The finder of an additional ~4.5 kg of reported finds (bringing the total to 446 meteorites) 

could not be verified, making it uncertain that some of these are not already in the list. 

Figure  5  shows  the  distribution  of  find  locations  relative  to  the  ground-projected  meteoroid 

trajectory. Open symbols in Fig. 5 show the position where we calculated that masses of different 

23 

 
size would have fallen if they were released during the first flare at 36.5 km (diamonds), or during 

the  final  one  at  27.4  km  altitude  (squares).  The  atmospheric  wind  sounding  data  from  stations 

17351  Adana  and  17130  Ankara  for  12h  UTC  September  2  and  0  h  UTC  September  3 

(http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html)  were  interpolated  to  estimate  the  prevailing 

winds at 20h10m UTC over Bingöl. The strewn field is compact, with small stones being blown 

towards the larger meteorites (Fig. 5). The calculated positions are in reasonable agreement with 

the actual find locations, the difference suggesting that the actual trajectory over the fall location 

was ~0.7 km further west than that extrapolated from the meteor trajectory. This is within bounds 

of the ±0.6 km uncertainty of the trajectory at the position of the meteor and ±0.8º uncertainty in 

direction of the radiant. 

The dispersion of the strewn field is most consistent with meteorites having fallen from the final 

disruption at 27.4 km. If material survived from the early breakup, then small masses should have 

fallen farther north of the known strewn field.  

Infrasound and Seismic Signals  

Infraround signals from the fireball were detected on the arrays I31, I48 and I46 of the International 

Monitoring  System  (IMS)  (Christie  and  Campus  2010).  Signals  were  identified  based  on  an 

increased signal correlation across the array, with the corresponding best beam azimuths consistent 

with arrival from the bolide and showing celerities near 0.28 kms-1 as expected for stratospheric 

arrivals (Ens et al. 2012). The signals measured at I46 and particularly I48 are quite weak, the 

latter  being  virtually  at  the  noise  level.  Other  stations  located  within  4,000  km  range  of  the 

estimated terminal burst location (39.1N, 40.2E) included I19, I26 and I43, which did not record 

the fireball.  

The Sariçiçek multi-station period average is 2.6 sec, which using the corresponding Ens et al. 

(2012) relation provides a yield of 0.12 kT (kiloton equivalent TNT = 4.184 x 1012 J). However 

the  confidence  bounds  are  comparable  to  the  value  itself  (i.e.,  0–0.20  kT).  For  this  event,  the 

periods are internally consistent for I31 and I46, but are much higher for I48 where the SNR is 

small. The I48 period (~5 s) is near the middle of the microbarom band (Garces et al. 2010) and 

24 

 
the pre- and postsignal microbaroms at this station are well defined and emanate from within a few 

tens of degrees of the bolide arrival azimuth. This makes the resulting signal suspect, as we cannot 

clearly distinguish the bolide signal from microbaroms at the station given the low SNR. Taking 

the I31 and I46 periods near ~1.8 s gives a 0.03 kT yield, using either the AFTAC period-yield 

relation (ReVelle 1997) or the Ens et al. (2012) single station period with a formal uncertainty 

upper limit of <0.06 kT.  

The amplitude and signal at I31 are sufficiently high that amplitude-based yields might also be 

expected to produce reasonable values (Edwards et al. 2006). Using the wind-corrected amplitude-

yield  in  Ens  et  al.  (2012)  produces  an  independent  estimate  of  ~0.05  kT.  The  small  dominant 

periods at the stations with strong, clear signals is consistent with a modest (~0.1 kT) yield and 

certainly not the type of infrasound signal normally found from a larger, kT-class bolide. A larger 

(>0.2 kT) event would have shown significantly more high-frequency content than detected at the 

stations.  

Turkey itself has a dense seismic network that monitors a seismically active area. Among the usual 

seismic  signatures  detected  by  nearby  stations,  we  searched  for  a  consistent  wave  pattern  that 

arrived at the stations at about the expected time for an airburst to couple to the ground after the 

event time at 20:10:30.15 (36.5 km altitude) UTC (Cansi 1995). Fourteen stations recorded a signal 

that traced the airwave generated by the meteor during the travel in the atmosphere, although they 

are covered by noise at some stations. Most energy in the airwave was at frequencies higher than 

3 Hz.  

Based on expected travel times, first arriving at most stations were the airwaves emanating from 

the  lower  final  airburst  at  27.4  km  altitude.  The  Bingöl  (BNGB)  and  Solhan  (SLHN)  seismic 

stations were nearest to this final flare at 38.9623N, 40.5289E. The time difference between the 

arrival times of airwaves at these stations is 63 s, which corresponds to a wave velocity of ~330 m 

s‒1, which is consistent with the mean sound wave velocity (Fig. 6). The airburst propagated slower 

to  the  stations  in  backward  direction  relative  to  the  meteor  path,  where  they  displayed  a  sharp 

waveform (Fig. 6), and arrived at these stations slightly later than the estimated arrival time from 

a constant 330 m s‒1.

Meteorite Physical Properties  

Density and Strength of Recovered Meteorites. 

The mean bulk volume density is 2.929 ± 0.003 g cm‒3 for SC12 (SC12b) and 2.890 ± 0.004 g/cm3 

for SC14, based on 3D volumes of 9.232 ± 0.011 and 6.822 ± 0.008 cm‒3, respectively. We adopted 

an  average  value  of  2.910  ±  0.020  g  cm‒3.  The  average  value  of  grain  density  from  multiple 

measurements of the same fragments is 3.221 ± 0.015 g cm‒3. From the bulk and grain densities, 

an average porosity of 9.4 ± 0.9% follows, in agreement with values in Macke et al. (2008). 

A cube-shaped sample of SC12 (5.09 ± 0.01 mm along the load direction, and 4.93 ± 0.01 mm and 

5.12 ± 0.01 mm in directions mutually perpendicular to this) was compressed to an initial peak of 

~75 MPa, followed by a slight drop corresponding to some failure. The sample then reloaded to 

an absolute maximum stress level of 79.1 ± 0.3 MPa, which is taken to be the compressive strength 

of  this  sample.  All  strength  values  were  measured  at  load/displacement  rates  low  enough  to 

correspond to quasistatic measurements of the sample strength. The range of strengths observed 

in  this  work  are  within  the  range  of  compressive  strengths  previously  observed  in  ordinary 

chondrite  samples  (6.2–420  MPa),  as  summarized  by  Kimberley  and  Ramesh  (2011).  Some 

laboratory strength measurements have been performed on metal meteorite samples (e.g. Johnson 

& Remo 1974; Furnish et al. 1995) and carbonaceous chondrites (Cotto-Figueroa et al. 2015), but 

there are no published strength measurements of achondritic stony meteorites, making the above 

reported measurement unique. 

The  whole-stone  compression  strength  measurements  are  more  uncertain,  because  of  possible 

shear stresses and an uncertain surface area. The combined data are shown in Table 4 and serve 

mainly to point out that SC12 may be representative for other recovered meteorites, but SC14 was 

significantly weaker.  

Fractures and Grain Orientation 

Figure 7 shows representative microCT images of Sariçiçek SC12 and SC14. The larger fragment 

SC12b-a1 shows the rich clast texture of this meteorite. Interesting features to note are the FeNi 

grains surrounded by a dark silicate in Fig. 7B, the large FeNi grain (~1mm) in Fig. 7C, and a grain 

26 

 
consisting of FeNi and FeS in Fig. 7H. Because SC14-a1 separated into two halves before imaging, 

the largest fracture line in Figs. 7E–F shows how the two halves were aligned for imaging.  

The  fractures  in  these  samples  were  mostly  caused  by  sample  preparation,  and  may  include 

intrinsic fractures and perhaps also fractures caused by the fall. The fracture length distribution in 

these samples may be representative for fracturing of the meteoroid during atmospheric entry. The 

density of fracture lengths from the highest resolution microCT images of SC12b-a2 and SC14-a2 

are displayed in Fig. 8. The fracture distribution is not a power law over the entire range of sizes 

because of limitations in counts at the smaller end, and limitations of the sample size at the larger 

end. In between, the slope corresponds to α = 0.130 ± 0.008 and 0.144 ± 0.011 for the SC12b-a1 

and SC14-a1, respectively. This value for α is lower than the value of 0.16 commonly used in 

models of atmospheric entry of ordinary chondrites. Instead, the value more similar to α ~ 0.11 of 

terrestrial basaltic rock. 

Analysis  of  the  alignment  of  metal  and  metal  sulfide  grains  in  fragment  SC12b-a1  show  weak 

evidence of grain shape orientation (Fig. 9). Each graph displays the orientation direction of the 

major  axis  of  the  grains.  There  is  a  common  band  in  both  graphs  that  may  be  interpreted  as 

flattening due to impact or perhaps as an effect of settling of soil particles. The axis of flattening 

is close to the center (0,0) direction in the graph. This analysis in 3D scans is the first of its kind 

in  a  howardite  sample  to  our  knowledge.  Previously,  Gattacceca  et  al.  (2008)  measured  the 

anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility of HED achondrites. They found, too, that the average 

petrographic fabric of magnetic grains in eucrites and howardites is oblate.  

Meteorite Petrography, Mineralogy, and Cosmochemistry  

Petrography and Mineralogy 

SC12a  (Fig.  10)  and  SC14  (Fig.  11)  contain  petrographically  heterogeneous  rock  consisting  of 

lithic and mineral clasts in a fine-grained matrix of crushed material. The matrix consists of high-

Ca pyroxene (probably clinopyroxene) from the eucritic component (having a composition range 

of Fs12‒68Wo6‒45, FeO/MnO= 21.0–45.9, with average Fs47Wo9 and Percent of Mean Deviation 

(PMD)  =  19.1%,  N=29),  low-Ca  pyroxene  (probably  orthopyroxene)  from  the  diogenitic 

27 

 
component  (Fs22‒70Wo1‒5,  FeO/MnO=  25.2–52.2,  average  Fs34Wo1,  PMD=35.5%,  N=29), 

plagioclase (An83.5‒89.6Or0.2‒4.0), silica, kamacite, troilite, chromite, ilmenite and rare olivine (Fa18-

21, FeO/MnO= 30.1–43.1, average Fa80, PMD=1.6%, N=4). Clino- and ortho-pyroxene are present 

in approximately equal amounts. Single mineral grains and clasts of orthopyroxene (Fs22‒70Wo1‒

2), clinopyroxene (Fs28‒60 Wo6‒36)‒some compositionally zoned, plagioclase (An85.5‒89.6Or0.2‒0.6), 

and  rare  olivine  (Fa21),  all  to  a  maximum  size  of  1  mm.  Sariçiçek  also  contains  rare  grains  of 

zircon, baddeleyite, and merrillite. 

Crystals  of  clinopyroxene  frequently  contain  exsolution  lamellae  of  orthopyroxene,  both 

containing oriented chromite inclusions. Three types of rock clasts are distinguished (see details 

in  Fig.  11).  (1)  Clasts  consisting  of  plagioclase  and  silica,  the  former  containing  inclusions  of 

chromite  and  ilmenite,  and  the  latter  containing  blebs  of  troilite;  (2)  clasts  consisting  of  an 

intergrowth of plagioclase and silica, with both phases hosting large blebs of troilite; (3) ophitic to 

subophitic  basalt  clasts  consisting  of  an  intergrowth  of  plagioclase  (An85Or1)  laths  and  zoned 

clinopyroxene (Fs33‒55 Wo6‒12), in some cases with troilite blebs situated along the boundaries of 

the  plagioclase  crystal  laths.  Single  mineral  grains  and  clasts  show  different  degrees  of  shock 

deformation, including irregular fractures and kinked pyroxene lamellae, and a significant fraction 

of  the  matrix  is  so  fine-grained  that  it  appears  opaque  in  thin  section.  The  total  abundance  of 

diogenitic material exceeds 10 vol % (Fig. 12A), which classifies the meteorite as a howardite.  

In sample SC181, xenolithic clasts detected comprised of metallic particles, a 2 mm sized clast 

rich in finely dispersed metallic iron grains similar to material found in ordinary chondrites, a 350 

micron sized chondrule, and a carbonaceous chondrite like clast. The metal grains sometimes had 

troilite (FeS) inclusions. Individual grains of troilite and chromite (FeCr2O4) were also found as 

inclusions in the silicate matrix. Metal grains consisted of kamacite with Ni content of 4–7 wt.% 

and Co of ~1 wt.%. Some grains with Ni content of 8–9 wt.% may have been martensite. One had 

associated Cu inclusions. Only one grain was found with both kamacite (4 wt% Ni) and taenite 

(43  wt%  Ni).  Two  kamacite  grains  had  exceptionally  low  Ni  abundance  of  0  and  1  wt%, 

respectively.  Similar  low  Ni  abundances  were  seen  in  metal  veins  in  the  silicate  matrix.  Many 

ilmenite and chromite inclusions were observed. 3–5 wt.% of Al was present, suggesting some 

28 

 
amount of hercynite (FeAl2O4). Two silicate particles, of size 0.5 and 0.2 mm respectively, had 

mosaic structure. The iron content was 2–6 wt% in black particles, 6–7 wt% in dark gray particles, 

and 14–17 wt% in light gray particles. One particle had an associated ilmenite inclusion (FeTiO3) 

at one side of the particle and many troilite inclusions bordering the other side.  

Bulk ElementalCcomposition: Major, Minor and Trace Element Abundances. 

The abundances for 58 major, minor, and trace elements are presented in Table 5. Thirty-eight 

elements were quantified by both laboratories in the consortium investigating the bulk composition 

of Sariçiçek. University of California at Davis (UCD) results are for the measurement of a single 

aliquot with a typical reproducibility of ≤5% based on repeat measurements of samples. Fordham 

University results are presented as a mean of the results for the five analyzed aliquots (see Methods 

section above). For the Fordham results, inter-aliquot errors in percent relative standard deviation 

are ≤14% for all elements except for the following (K: 18%, Ni: 17%, Cs: 20%, Ir: 24%), which 

is typical considering sample homogeneity.  

The measured aliquots are large enough for the interlaboratory analyses of most elements to agree 

within measurement error. Larger differences are found for: Na (28% difference), Al (28%), Co 

(70%), Ni (factor 2.5 difference), Ga (50%), Ru (80%), and Pt (40%), which indicate variation in 

the  amounts  of  plagioclase  and  FeNi  alloys  between  the  samples  measured.  In  general,  the 

refractory  platinum  group  and  siderophile  elements  show  larger  discrepancies  than  lithophile 

elements,  which  may  be  attributed  to  a  nugget  effect  during  sampling  or  because  of  intrinsic 

differences between stones SC12 (measured at UCD) and SC14 (Fordham). Because of the general 

agreement of the values generated by the two laboratories, when discussing our results we use the 

mean value of the two. We note that the conclusions would be the same if either laboratory’s results 

would have been used separately. 

As may be expected from their origins as mixtures of eucritic and diogenitic end members, the 

howardites  generally  possess  compositions  between  those  established  for  the  eucrites  and 

diogenites. Compared to the very complete database of Warren et al. (2009), Sariçiçek has Al, Co, 

Ni, Sc, Sm, and V abundances as a function of Ca and Mg that indicate a howardite composition 

29 

 
(e.g., Al2O3 versus MgO in Fig. 12B). The compositions indicate a slightly greater affinity to the 

eucrites than the diogenites. This is borne out in the mineralogy of Sariçiçek, which shows greater 

eucrite material than diogenite material.  

Warren  et  al.  (2009)  postulated  that  a  subset  of  the  howardites  possess  higher  than  typical 

siderophile element abundances and higher than typical amounts of noble gases (Fig. 13).  They 

called these the “regolithic howardites” and this subgroup differs from typical howardites in that 

they are probably true surface material rather than simply eucrites‒diogenite mixtures. Sarıçiçek 

has a relatively high iridium abundance of 8–10 ng g‒1 (Table 5). This relatively high siderophile 

element content of Sarıçiçek and noble gas abundance (20Ne = 1.8 nL g‒1 STP), see below, would 

place  Sariçiçek  in  the  “regolithic  howardite”  region  defined  by  Warren  et  al.  (2009).  The 

Meteoritical  Bulletin  has  352  entries  for  howardites  (17  falls)  (https://www.lpi.usra.edu/ 

meteor/metbull.php, last accessed April 5, 2018). Including Sariçiçek, 15 are now known to be 

regolithic howardites (Cartwright et al. 2013, 2014). 

Oxygen Isotope Analysis 

Oxygen  isotope  values  are  listed  in  Table  6.  The  δ18O  values  of  bulk  Sariçiçek  rock  chips  are 

typical of other HED meteorite (Clayton and Mayeda 1996, 1999; Scott et al. 2009). The Δ17O’ 

values are on the more negative side of typical HEDs, but overlapping the normal HED ranges of 

Δ17O' = ‒0.247 ± 0.050 and δ18O = 3.74 ± 0.56 (2s). The prime symbol here points to differences 

based on isotope ratios being plotted on a natural log scale. In contrast, Bunburra Rockhole had 

Δ17O' = ‒0.127 ± 0.044 (Bland et al. 2009). The portion of SC14 that was not acid-treated yielded 

the same oxygen isotope results, suggesting that terrestrial alteration in this stone was absent to 

minimal. Stone SC14 was larger than SC12, and was possibly only affected by rain at its outermost 

areas. Sample SC12 was found 16 days after the fall, sample SC14 28 days (Table 2). 

The two monomineralic feldspar analyses yielded the most positive δ18O values of this entire data 

set. The variation in three-oxygen isotope space of the bulk rock subsamples are a function of their 

modal  abundances  of  pyroxenes  and  feldspars,  as  expected  from  intermineral  isotope 

30 

 
 
fractionations  in  magmatic  systems  which  show  a  temperature-dependent  difference  between 

pyroxene δ18O values (more negative) and feldspar δ18O values. 

Chromium and Titanium Isotope Analysis 

The Cr isotopic results are shown in Table 7. The Cr isotopic composition is reported in ε-notation, 

deviations of the  53Cr/52Cr and  54Cr/52Cr ratios from the measured NIST SRM 979 terrestial Cr 

isotopic standard in parts per 10,000.  Figure 14 shows the combined Δ17O’-ε54Cr systematics for 

Sariçiçek.  While previous studies have documented the composition of eucrites and diogenites 

(Trinquier et al. 2007; Sanborn and Yin 2014, Sanborn et al. 2016), prior to this study there have 

been no howardites investigated. To this end, in addition to Sariçiçek, another classified howardite, 

Bholghati, was also analyzed. In terms of both Δ17O’ and ε54Cr, Sariçiçek SC14 and Bholghati 

overlap in their composition. While the Δ17O’ for Sariçiçek plots marginally lower than the bulk 

of the normal eucrites and diogenite field, the ε54Cr is indistinguishable with that of the normal 

eucrites and diogenites. The small offset in Δ17O’ (Fig. 14) is probably due to the regolithic nature 

of Sariçiçek (see above), a small admixture of xenolith clasts, or a cryptic component that were 

thoroughly mixed with the howardite. Both isotopes could be displaced from the normal HEDs 

towards the lower right by carbonaceous chondrite components, most likely CM/CV types, which 

plot outside and to the lower right of Fig. 14 at around ε54Cr ~ +0.9 and Δ17O’ ~ -3 (Sanborn et al. 

2016). 

The  Ti  isotope  results  are  listed  in  Table  8.  In  addition  to  Sariçiçek,  dissolutions  from  three 

different eucrites (Béréba, Juvinas, and Pasamonte) were also analyzed in this study. The average 

of  the  Ti  isotope  data  for  Sariçiçek  agrees  with  the  average  obtained  from  the  three  eucrites. 

Moreover, the Ti isotope composition of Sariçiçek and the three eucrites overlap with previous 

data obtained on eucrites and the howardite Kapoeta (Zhang et al. 2012; Williams 2015) within 

the analytical uncertainties. Since each meteorite group displays its own characteristic Ti isotope 

compositions (Trinquier et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2012; Williams 2015), this is further evidence 

that Sariçiçek belongs to the HED meteorite clan. 

Xenolithic Organic Matter 

31 

 
The  inner  face  white/light  grey  regions  of  meteorite  SC239  are  plagioclase  feldspars  (major 

component,  anorthite)  and  quartz,  while  the  Raman  spectra  of  the  probed  dark  grey  and  black 

regions  are  essentially  identical,  showing  signatures  of  pyroxene  type  minerals  (clino-  and 

orthopyroxene) and traces of olivine, mixed with carbonaceous materials (D- and G-bands) (Fig. 

15). The carbonaceous material is thought to be xenolithic. 

No visible carbonaceous inclusions were found in SC12a, but a carbonaceous chondrite clast was 

observed  in  SC181  (see  above).  SC12  did  contain  a  cryptic  component  of  organics.  SC12  was 

found to be highly depleted in amino acids with a total amino acid abundance of 45 ppb (Table 9). 

SC12 contained only trace amounts (~0.2‒10 ppb) of the common protein amino acids glycine, 

aspartic and glutamic acids, serine, alanine and valine, as well as the nonprotein amino acids, a-, 

b- and g-amino-n-butyric acid, a-aminoisobutyric acid and e-amino-n-caproic acid. In contrast to 

most  carbonaceous  chondrites  which  contain  several  hundred  to  several  thousand  ppb  of 

extraterrestrial amino acids in the free form (Glavin et al. 2010), no free amino acids above a level 

of 0.1 ppb were detected in SC12. This suggests the parent body of Sariçiçek was highly depleted 

in amino acids and amino acid precursors. 

Trace  amounts  of  predominately  the  L-enantiomers  of  the  protein  amino  acids  aspartic  and 

glutamic acids, alanine, serine, and valine were detected above procedural blank levels in SC12, 

which indicates that this sample was exposed to some terrestrial amino acid contamination before 

it  was  recovered  on  September  18,  2015,  during  collection,  or  during  subsequent  handling. 

Sariçiçek SC14 had a much higher amino acid abundance (~ 666 ppb total), but it was recovered 

12  days  later,  after  rain,  and  the  enantiomeric  composition  of  amino  acids  was  similar  to  the 

terrestrial pebble and soil collected at the meteorite recovery locations, pointing to direct exposure 

to terrestrial amino acids at the landing site (Table 9). 

Sariçiçek SC12 was also poor in polar soluble organic matter, but did contain compounds intrinsic 

to meteorites. Signals covered the whole mass range up to 750 amu (atomic mass unit). All mass 

peaks  resulted  in  4000  elementary  compositions  in  the  C-H-N-O-S-Mg  elemental  space. 

Thermostable compounds containing C, H, and O, as well as those containing C, H, O and Mg, 

including the dihydroxymagnesium carboxylates described by Ruf et al. (2016), were equally most 

32 

 
important in number and covered almost 75% of the total number of elementary compositions, 

followed by sulphur- and nitrogen-containing compounds respectively. Terrestial impurity signals 

were minimized to ubiquitous alkyl benzene sulfonates and biogenic fatty acids.  

Cosmogenic Randionuclides and Pre-Atmospheric Size 

The  AMS  results  for  10Be,  26Al,  and  36Cl  of  samples  SC12  and  SC14  are  listed  in  Table  10. 

Calculated  production  rates  from  the  model  of  Leya  and  Masarik  (2009)  use  the  measured 

elemental concentrations from Table 5. Figure 16 compares the measured concentrations for 26Al, 

to model calculations for objects with radii of 12–100 cm. Similar calculations were done for 10Be 

and 36Cl. These concentrations are not only affected by shielding conditions, but also by variations 

in target element composition. The main target elements for 36Cl production are Ca and Fe. Since 

the relative production rate of 36Cl from Ca is a factor of 10 higher than from Fe, we normalized 

the measured 36Cl concentrations to total Fe +10 ´ Ca to account for variations in the two main 

target elements for 36Cl production in Sariçiçek. The higher 36Cl concentration in SC14 is partly 

due to a higher Ca content and partly due to a higher shielding depth of this fragment. The high 

measured concentrations clearly indicate that 10Be, 26Al and 36Cl levels represent saturation values, 

as expected for a meteorite with the CRE age of ~22 Ma derived from the cosmogenic noble gases.  

There are two degrees of freedom in fitting the models to the measurements: the production rates 

have an absolute uncertainty of about 10% (Leya and Masarik 2009), which permits a 10% vertical 

shift  of  the  model  diagram,  and  the  pre-atmospheric  depth  of  the  two  Sariçiçek  samples  is  not 

known a priori, which permits a horizontal shift of the measured points in Fig. 16. However, the 

pre-atmospheric  depth  of  a  given  fragment  needs  to  be  the  same  for  all  elements  considered. 

Consistent results are achieved for a shielding depths of 5 ± 5 cm (SC12) and 15 ± 5 cm (SC14), 

respectively, and an object with a pre-atmospheric radius of ~50 cm. With those shielding depths, 

the nominal production rate model of 10Be by Leya and Masarik (2009) needs to be increased by 

8% (shifting the model up 8%), consistent with our previous findings that the 10Be production rates 

are systematically on the low side (Welten et al. 2012), while 36Cl production rates were increased 

by 10%.  

33 

 
The  example  of  Fig.  16  shows  that  the  26Al  concentration  for  both  SC12  and  SC14  are  in  the 

expected range of calculated production rates for howardites with pre-atmospheric radii of 40–60 

cm (mass of 800–2600 kg). All radionuclide concentrations would permit irradiation in an object 

with a radius up to ~80 cm, but this would not yield a consistent shielding depth for SC14. For 

example, the 26Al concentration would also permit irradiation at a depth of 15–20 in an object with 

80 cm radius, whereas the  10Be and  36Cl concentrations would favour a depth of >40 cm in the 

same object. We thus favour a radius of 40–60 cm. 

The stone SC26 (Fig. 24, below) was measured at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso by 

gamma ray spectroscopy 35 days after the fall. The concentrations of the natural radionuclides 

232Th and 238U as well as for 40K in the meteorite specimens are listed in Table 11. All of them are 

in accordance with the measurements presented in Table 5.  

In Table 11 are given also the measured activity concentrations for the positively identified short- 

and medium-lived cosmogenic radionuclides (7Be, 46Sc, 54Mn, 22Na, 26Al). Only upper detection 

limits are reported for  48V, 51Cr,  56Co, 57Co,  58Co,  60Co and  44Ti. The activity of the very short-

lived radionuclides 52Mn (half-life = 6 days), 48V (half-life = 16 days) and 51Cr (half-life = 28 days) 

was  below  the  detection  limit.  The  radionuclides  of  cobalt  are  expected  to  be  low,  as  the 

composition of the howardite shows this element only in trace quantities. The given activities are 

the ones calculated back to the date of fall following the simple decay law, taking into account the 

time that passed between the fall of the meteorite and its measurement. In order to estimate the 

depth of origin of the specimen within the meteoroid, the data of 54Mn and 22Na were used. The 

22Na  data  was  compared  to  the  calculations  of  Bhandari  et  al.  (1993)  for  H  chondrites, 

renormalizing the measured concentrations and taking into account the different concentrations of 

the target elements (Al, Mg, Si) in the howardite with respect to an average H chondrite (Table 5). 

If we take the measured activity as saturation value the resulting possible range in the radius is 5–

15 cm. If we assume that it came from anywhere in the meteoroid the range cannot be determined. 

The  rather  low  specific  activity  shows  only  that  the  specimen  most  probably  comes  from  the 

surface of the parent body.  

34 

 
The data of 54Mn was normalised to the concentration of its main target Fe (as reported in the other 

sections). Comparing the measured activity of  54Mn to the calculations of Kohman and Bender 

(1967) would give a range for the radius of <20 cm in case SC26 came from the central part, or a 

larger radius if it came from near the surface of a larger body. Indeed, the measured value for 26Al 

of (79.0 ± 6.1) dpm kg-1 plots in the top few centimeters of the surface of a larger meteoroid (Fig. 

16). 

Solar Wind Derived Noble Gases (He, Ne, Ar) and Cosmic-Ray Exposure Ages 

Regolithic howardites are defined primarily by their high content of solar wind noble gases (see 

previous Fig. 13; Warren et al. 2009; Cartwright et al. 2014). Results from noble gas measurements 

are  listed  in  Table  12.  From  the  three  noble  gases  He,  Ne,  and  Ar  measured,  Ne  is  the  most 

straightforward to interpret. The Ne isotopic composition of all Sariçiçek samples (Fig. 17) can be 

understood  as  a  two-component  mixture  between  a  solar  wind  component  fractionated  during 

implantation into the regolith (Grimberg et al. 2006) and a cosmogenic component with 22Ne/21Ne 

= ~1.11. 

This 22Ne/21Ne ratio–according to a production rate model by Leya and Masarik (2009) for a radius 

of R = 50 cm meteoroid with target chemistry measured in Sariçiçek–is compatible with shielding 

depths of 5 ± 5 cm and 15 ± 5 cm for SC12 and SC14, respectively, deduced from cosmogenic 

radionuclides. The concentration of cosmogenic 21Ne (21Necos) resulting from the two-component 

deconvolution between solar and cosmogenic endmembers is given in Table 12. The elemental 

composition of Sariçiçek SC12 and SC14 (Tab. 5) and the cosmogenic 22Ne/21Ne ratio (~1.11) was 

used  to  determine  production  rates  of  cosmogenic  nuclides  (3He,  21Ne,  38Ar),  applying  the 

empirical formulas given by Eugster and Michel (1995) for howardites. The calculated production 

rates, nominal and regolith-contribution-corrected cosmic-ray exposure ages are given in Table 

13. 

The He isotopic composition of Sariçiçek is a mixture of at least three components: solar wind He, 

cosmogenic  He  (addopting  4He/3He  =  5.2  as  suggested  by  Eugster  and  Michel  1995),  and 

radiogenic 4He from the decay of U and Th. So there are three components, but only two isotopes 

35 

 
to resolve them. This degeneracy can partially be broken by using the variable concentration of 

solar noble gases in the samples. The non-cosmogenic 20Nenon-cos, i.e., the measured 20Ne minus 

the  cosmogenic  20Ne  calculated  from  21Necos,  can  plausibly  be  assumed  to  be  pure  solar  wind, 

based on the Ne three isotope diagram (Fig. 17). By plotting the non-cosmogenic 4He (where 4Hecos 

~ 5.2 × 3Hemeas, since the 3He/4He ratio suggests ~90% of the 3He is cosmogenic) against 20Nenon-

cos, extrapolation to 20Nenon-cos = 0 should reveal any radiogenic 4He excess as y-axis intercept (Fig. 

18). Using a trend line through all four samples, the radiogenic 4He excess corresponds (with SC26 

whole stone U = 57 ± 3 ppb [Table 11] and typical Th/U = 3.5 [Nittler et al. 2004]) to a radiogenic 

retention age of 2.3‒".$
Th  abundances  in  Table  5  (assuming  3%  uncertainty  in  absolute  concentrations)  the  resulting 

%".& Ga (1σ). If the samples are fitted individually using the measured U and 

radiogenic  4He concentration corresponds to radiogenic retention ages (1σ) of 1.76‒".’(
SC12 and 2.6 ± 0.3 Ga for SC14, respectively (Table 13).  

%".)* Ga for 

All four samples yield a consistent 40Ar concentration of 10.30 ± 0.15 (1σ) × nL g‒1 STP (Table 

12), suggesting that the 40Ar is mainly radiogenic. The concentration of adsorbed atmospheric 40Ar 

would be expected to vary with the sample surface area and mass. The measured concentration 

corresponds (at measured K = 248 ± 14 and 220 ± 10 ppm, see Table 5) to a retention age of 3.50 

± 0.07 and 3.7 ± 0.1 Ga for SC12 and SC14, respectively. 

The nominal cosmic-ray exposure ages of Sariçiçek SC12 (given in brackets in Table 13) are 20, 

29, and 29 Ma for cosmogenic He, Ne, and Ar, respectively, and 24, 30, 30 Ma for fragment SC14. 

The He ages are lower than the Ne and Ar ages, which is often observed for meteorites and usually 

explained by partial diffusive loss of He. These exposure ages have to be corrected for potential 

pre-exposure of the samples in the regolith, as shown by Wieler et al. (1989) for Fayetteville (H4) 

and more recently by Meier et al. (2014) for Ghubara (L5). Grains with higher residence times 

have a higher average probability to pick up solar wind, and will also experience, on average, a 

longer exposure to cosmic rays. 

This means that for regolith breccias, the nominal cosmic-ray exposure age is not representative 

of  the  time  the  meteoroid  actually  spent  in  space  on  its  way  to  Earth  (4π  exposure),  but  also 

contains a pre-exposure signature from irradiation in the parent body regolith (2π exposure). When 

36 

 
extrapolating the Ne (or Ar) data down to a concentration of zero solar gas, the 4π exposure (which 

affects all samples invariably) can be resolved from the 2π exposure, which affects samples as a 

function  of  their  solar  wind  content  (Fig.  19).  The  resulting  4π  exposure  ages  (corrected  for 

shielding at the respective positions of the two samples) are in a range of 20–23 Ma, in excellent 

agreement  with  a  peak  in  the  exposure  age  distribution  of  howardites  (Welten  et  al.  1997).  A 

cosmic-ray exposure age at the peak of the 22 Ma clan distribution suggests that Sariçiçek did not 

further break after ejection prior to impacting Earth. Since the production rates fall roughly by a 

factor of ~2 when going from 4π to 2π exposure (e.g., Leya et al. 2001), the 2π cosmogenic noble 

gases  correspond  to  regolith  exposure  ages  of  ~12–14  Ma.  This  regolith  exposure  must  have 

happened within a few meters of the surface, at an arbitrary time before ejection ~22 Ma ago.  

U-Pb Chronology 

The  U-Pb  dating  results  for  zircon  (some  examples  shown  in  both  cathodoluminescence  and 

backscattered electron images in Fig. 20A) and baddeleyite (shown in Fig. 20B) are listed in Tables 

14 and 15, respectively, where uncertainties for individual isotopic data analyses are reported as 

1σ.  

The U-Pb dating results for apatite (individual grains shown in Fig. 21) are listed in Table 16, 

where uncertainties for individual isotopic data analyses are reported as 1σ. The intercept age and 

Pb-Pb ages in Fig. 22, quoted at the 95% confidence level, were calculated using ISOPLOT 3.0 

(Ludwig 2003). The new solar system average 238U/235U ratio of 137.794 ± 0.027 (Goldmann et 

al. 2015) was used in the age calculations and data reduction.  

Raman results show that the baddeleyite in Sariçiçek is monoclinic, which implies that later impact 

events did not disturb its U-Pb isotopic system (Niihara 2012, Zhou et al. 2013). The U-Pb ages 

of zircons, baddeleyites and apatites revealed a concordant ages of 4550.4 ± 2.5 Ma, 4553.5 ± 8.8 

Ma, and 4525 ± 17 Ma, respectively, consistent within error to their corresponding Pb-Pb ages of 

4551.1  ±  2.8  Ma,  4558.0  ±  8.2  Ma,  and  4524  ±  12  Ma.  Using  the  new  solar  system  average 

238U/235U ratio of 137.794 ± 0.027 (Goldmann et al. 2015) in place of old value of 137.88 results 

37 

 
in a downward age adjustment of ‒0.88 Ma. It is still within the quoted uncertainties of SIMS 

results.  

Thermoluminescence 

The natural thermoluminescence (TL) of Sariçiçek (Table 17) is at the peak in the histogram for 

HED meteorites at 10 krad equivalent dose (Sears et al. 1991; Takeda and Graham 1991). This 

reflects the recent recovery of the meteorite and an orbit with a “normal” perihelion. The measured 

perihelion distance of Sariçiçek (q = 1.0087 AU) is therefore characteristic of other HED falls.  

If Sariçiçek were an eucrite, the induced TL sensitivity values would place it in the petrologic type 

3  class  defined  by  Takeda  and  Graham  (1991),  which  have  TL  sensititivy  of  250–400.  The 

presence of diogenite will lower the TL sensitivity by dilution. A 10% diogentic component would 

place Sariçiçek still in the petrologic type 3 class.  

Spectral Reflectance 

Reflectance spectra of all the samples are plotted in Fig. 23. The samples are reasonably fresh for 

the optical spectroscopic purposes based on the 1 and 2 µm band shapes (Table 18) and the strength 

of the 3 µm hydration (terrestrial weathering) band. According to the Band I and Band II center 

and band area ratio plots (Fig. 23), the reflectance spectra are consistent with a howardite that is 

relatively rich in eucrite material. The spectra are also broadly consistent with Vesta, given that 

Vestan regolith is richer in eucrite material than diogenite material (Ruesch et al. 2015).  

The near-IR reflection and absorption spectra show two major bands at 0.9 μm (Band I) and 2.0 

μm (Band II). Two weak bands were observed at 1.19 µm and 1.31 µm, which are attributed to the 

M1 site in pyroxenes (Klima et al. 2008) or small amounts of plagioclase (Karr et al. 1975; Cloutis 

et  al.  2013),  respectively.  Plagioclase  contains  minor  amounts  of  Fe+2.  The  Band  I  center  was 

observed at 0.93 μm for each sample while Band II center was observed at 1.97 μm, 1.97 μm, 1.98 

μm and 2.00 μm for SC55, SC239, SC327 and SC51, respectively (Table 18). Ruesch et al. (2015) 

reported that a correlation exists between the wavelengths of Band I, Band II centers and ferrosilite 

(Fs),  wollastonite  (Wo)  contents.  Table  18  lists  the  calculated  Fs  and  Wo  contents.  The 

38 

 
spectroscopic  ranges  obtained  overlap  the  compositional  range  measured  with  the  electron 

microprobe. 

Heating and Surface Ablation 

In this sample SC26, we have a rare surviving fragment of surface material, presumably from the 

back of the original meteoroid (Fujiwara et al. 1989). SC26 has features that show its predominant 

orientation during the late stages of flight. The back side (Fig. 24A) shows a melt rim, where melt 

flowing from the front side of the meteorite was blown away. The front side (Fig. 24B) has flow 

lines and more rounded features. This side has the smooth relatively flat surfaces that are created 

in  a  late  breakup  relatively  deep  in  the  atmosphere,  presumably  during  the  27.4  km  altitude 

breakup.  

The  back  side  (Fig.  24A)  is  much  more  irregular  in  shape.  The  regmaglypts  (thumbprint-like 

indentations)  point  to  a  different  manner  of  ablation.  With  less  than  2  cm  overburden  from  its 

center, it is unlikely that the regmaglypt pattern is due to turbulent flow. Instead, the pattern may 

have originated from spallation of low-melting-point minerals near the surface, or from features 

in the surface that were pre-atmospheric. 

All samples have a distinct sheen, which was identified as due to abundant vesicles (from vapor 

bubbles)  in  the  fusion  crust,  presumably  trapped  in  a  melt  with  higher  viscosity  than  that  of 

ordinary chondrites (Fig. 25A). The number of vesicles decreases exponentially with increasing 

vesicle size in the 6–50 µm range, with most vesicle volume at small 6–10 µm size scales (Fig. 

25B). Just above the unmelted meteorite material is a layer of initially modified material, which 

appears homogenized with some scattered vesicles (Fig. 25A). At other places, the bottom of the 

fusion crust showed a pattern of parallel fractures filled with silicate melt (not shown). At places, 

melted troilite fills pre-existing cracks. At the bottom of the melt layer are metal grains. A small 

grain of gold was detected here in the Ural Federal University study of SC181. Above that layer, 

bubbles form in a densely stacked pattern throughout a melt layer as a result of the evaporation of 

volatile components such as sulfides (layer labeled "viscous melt" in Fig. 25A). At the top of the 

glass layer, large bubbles are found, some of which have broken the surface (Fig. 25A). 

39 

 
The  heating  experiments  at  ambient  pressure  of  SC239  showed  that  the  sample  remained 

unchanged up to 1300 K. At 1490 K, a notable amount of liquid phase is formed on the surface, 

causing a foaming. This confirms that gasses remained trapped in the melt. At 1499 K, bubbles 

migrate  to  the  surface  and  pressure  was  released.  At  1513  K,  the  meteorite  showed  increased 

melting and started to deform into a droplet-like shape. When heated at 5 K min‒1, the apparent 

viscosity of the sample reached a value of about 1010 poises (the sintering point) in the temperature 

range 1370–1410 K and a value of about 105.5  poises (at the half sphere point) at 1510–1530 K. It 

is  not  clear  that  the  sample  was  totally  molten  at  these  temperatures.  Tomography  of  the  heat-

treated sample shows inhomogeneity, suggesting that some parts did not melt completely at the 

temperatures applied. The porosity of the heat-treated sample was 45%, suggesting significant gas 

evolution during heat treatment.  

The front (Fig. 24B) side of SC26 has fusion crust that is slightly more red in color compared to 

the  yellowish  back  side  (Fig.  24A).  This  coloration  is  also  seen  in  other  oriented  Sariçiçek 

meteorites.  The  redder  color  signifies  a  stronger  oxidation  at  higher  temperatures:  The  melted 

sample SC239 had changed colour from its original dark brown to a more reddish-brown. At high 

magnification in SEM images obtained by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences institutes, crystals 

were seen scattered in a glassy matrix. The glassy matrix has a composition similar to the bulk 

meteorite based on EDS analysis. Triangular crystals have a composition rich in iron and oxygen, 

suggesting the formation of octrahedral magnetite, while some other crystals suggest the formation 

of iron carbonates based on EDS analysis. Such crystals are also found inside the vesicles.  

DISCUSSION 

Chronology of Primary Igneous Differentiation and Thermal Metamorphism in Sariçiçek 

The peak age of basaltic magmatism on Vesta is 4552 ± 7 Ma (2σ), based on combining our U(Pb)-

Pb  dating  results  for  zircons  and  baddeleyites  in  Sariçiçek  with  the  compilation  of  published 

U(Pb)-Pb zircon data from non-cumulate eucrites (e.g., Zhou et al. 2013). Although the U-Pb ages 

for zircon and baddeleyite are similar to each other within analytical error, it seems that the age of 

baddeleyite  is  slightly  but  systematically  older  than  zircon.  This  is  reasonable  because  (1)  a 

40 

 
baddeleyite  core  was  seen  surrounded  by  a  zircon  mantle  (Fig.  20B,  upper  right  panel);  (2) 

baddeleyite (ZrO2) forms during early stages of magma crystallization, and zircon (ZrSiO4) forms 

later when silica (SiO2) saturation is achieved during magmatic differentiation and evolution. The 

age difference is likely to be small, depending on the longevity of the magma chamber. However, 

zircon could also be formed by metamorphic or metasomatic replacement of primary baddeleyite 

in contact with silica-rich partial melt or fluid. Age difference can be large or small in this case. 

This has been observed in terrestrial magmatic systems (e.g., Davidson and Van Breemen 1988; 

Amelin et al. 1999). 

Younger apatite ages clearly post date the crystallization ages of zircons and baddeleyites by ~27 

Ma.  This  could  be  due  to  impact  resetting,  or  alternatively  due  to  parent  body  metamorphism. 

Evidence from eucrites indicates that most mafic material  on Vesta underwent metamorphism on 

a global scale (Yamaguchi et al. 1996, 1997). If so, the lower closure temperature for Pb diffusion 

in this phase allowed those grains to continue to equilibrate during metamorphism after the zircon 

phases had had their U-Pb ages frozen in. 

Meteoroid Size, Fragmentation and Impact Hazard 

Sariçiçek is the first 22 Ma clan HED meteorite fall that was observed by instrumental techniques. 

The manner of energy deposition of the meteoroid is ground truth for models that simulate the 

damaging effects from impacts of larger 20‒100 m sized V-class asteroids.  

Light Curve Simulation From Simple Fragmentation Models 

The  meteor 

lightcurve  was  modeled  using 

the  one-dimensional 

triggered  progressive 

fragmentation model (TPFM) (ReVelle 2003, 2004; Ceplecha and ReVelle 2005), which calculates 

the  bolide's  light  curve  and  deceleration  profile  based  on  an  assumed  fragmentation  behaviour 

rooted  in  empirical  modeling  of  bolides.  The  initial  breaking  strength,  strength  increase  (via  a 

strength multiplier), and porosity are free parameters. The strength parameter controls the peak of 

the calculated lightcurve, the porosity value the drop off.  

Best-fit curves are shown in Fig. 4. The assumed initial breaking strength of 0.05 MPa for the 

meteor does replicate the fragmentation features observed in the high-altitude portion of flight; the 

41 

 
replication  of  one  or  more  of  the  features  in  the  light  curve  only  requires  the  strength  of  the 

fragments to increase by a factor of 1.5 over each fragmentation event. This appears to hold good 

up to an altitude of 55 km. From an altitude of 55 km down to an altitude of 40 km, the strength 

increase is more than an order of magnitude. The breakup altitudes at approximately 36, 33, 31, 

27 km correspond to dynamic strengths of 0.05, 0.075, 0.11, 2.0 MPa. Although the code cannot 

replicate multiple flares, the break up of the meteoroid from 40 km down to roughly 27 km is 

replicated in a mean sense by allowing the ablation coefficient to vary with altitude.  

We conclude that solutions for meteoroid diameters of 0.8–1.2 m can fit the lightcurve based on 

the  proposed  calibration  of  absolute  intensity  of  the  fireball,  in  agreement  with  the  diameter 

derived from cosmogenic nuclides of ~1.0 m. With an entry speed of 17.1 ± 0.8 km s‒1, the impact 

energy was 0.025–0.101 kT. This energy estimate agrees well with the 0.03–0.05 kT estimates 

from analysis of the infrasound signals of the Sariçiçek event. These results are a factor of two 

lower than the 0.13 kT impact energy reported from U.S. Government satellites. 

Fragmentation in 2-D Hydrodynamical Simulation 

To gain more insight into the manner of fragmentation, a set of hydrocode simulations were run 

on  the  Sariçiçek  meteoroid  entry.  Simulations  were  conducted  on  the  NASA  Pleiades 

supercomputer  at  NASA  Ames  Research  Center,  using  the  hydrocode  ALE3D  from  Lawrence 

Livermore National Laboratory (Robertson and Mathias 2015). Larger asteroids are thought to be 

rubble piles, with rubble following a size frequency distribution N ~ 1/r3, deduced from imaging 

of asteroid Itokawa (Sanchez and Scheeres 2014). Small asteroids such as Sariçiçek could be either 

a monolithic rock of relatively high strength or a weakly consolidated collection of boulders held 

together by Van der Waals forces (e.g., Hirabayashi et al. 2015, Campo Bagatin et al. 2018). 

The  high  altitude  emission  from  Sariçiçek  points  to  exposed  weakly  consolidated  materials  or 

efficient ablation of rock at the exposed surface due to melting and vaporization in the intense heat 

of the bow shock. The smaller a meteoroid, the more important ablation is. Small ~0.1 m sized 

meteoroids in meteor showers ablate high in the atmosphere. For large meteoroids, ablation is less 

important because it is only a surface effect and thermal penetration is typically only centimeters 

42 

 
deep, or less. The approximate 1 m diameter Sariçiçek meteoroid is at the boundary between where 

ablation  is  dominant  and  where  it  is  negligible.  Here,  we  investigated  the  effects  of  a  weakly 

consolidated layer. The investigation of heat transfer and ablation is postponed to a future study.  

To account for the flares at 36‒27 km altitude, there are two options. The first is a monolithic rock 

with internal fractures, voids, or other weaknesses of a particular strength that would fail when the 

dynamic pressure exceeds those strengths. Under this scenario, the rock would initially fracture 

when the dynamic pressure overcomes the strength of the monolith. In the fragment-cloud model 

of Wheeler et al. (2017), it would fracture into two or more pieces plus a cloud of dust. The dust 

cloud would be responsible for a flare and the resulting fragments would continue until they in 

turn reach a dynamic pressure that causes them to fail.  

One of our simulations studied a “cherry” structure asteroid with a thick strengthless outer layer 

of material and a core with randomized strengths of 5, 10, and 20 MPa. The outer layer does blow 

off high in the atmosphere and even appears to roughly match the peak in energy deposition seen 

at  56  km,  but  does  not  sustain  the  energy  deposition  rate  observed  at  lower  altitudes.  The 

simulation does show distinct flares, but at higher altitude than observed. When the core starts to 

fail at 43 km altitude, smaller pieces are swept away into the flow and rapidly decelerated, while 

some material persists to lower depth as large fragments. Significantly higher strengths would be 

required to match the flares, but this simulation showed it is possible to create distinct flares from 

the disruption of a monolithic object with a distribution of internal strengths. 

Figure 26 shows the results for an alternative interior structure consisting of a rubble pile of four 

monolithic boulders embedded in weaker fine-grained material. Integrating the energy under the 

light curve gives energies of 149 GJ for material deposited above 38 km, and 116, 88, 78, 94 GJ 

for the flares. Using the density of recovered meteorites (2910 kg m‒3) and a flight speed of 17.1 

km s‒1, the boulders can be estimated as being of diameters 0.81, 0.73, 0.70, and 0.75 m within 

1.27 m3 of weaker material at the surface, assuming all the weaker material blows off in the upper 

atmosphere and each boulder deposits all of its energy in each flare. The simulation shows the 

exterior weak layer blowing off at high altitude and as expected shows four flares. With sufficient 

tuning, this could also provide a match to the observed lightcurve.  

43 

 
Interestingly the simulation also shows, at around 33 km altitude, the weaker leading and trailing 

boulders have structurally failed but are not immediately dispersed into the flow (Fig. 26). Instead 

the stronger unbroken boulder and the bow shock hold the leading debris in place, and the trailing 

debris drafts behind. In this way the intact boulder delays the dispersion of some of the weaker 

material, and a significant amount of it remains entrained until the strongest boulder finally fails 

then pancakes and flares. The simulation was axi-symmetric 2D, and the extent to which failed 

material can draft in front or behind an intact boulder in a 3D simulations remains to be seen.  

However, the observed distribution of fragments on the ground implies that most of the meteoroid 

held together until the final flare at 27 km altitude. This suggests that the lighter, weaker pieces 

contributed to the higher flares, and were reduced to dust creating few meteorites on the ground, 

but the stronger, larger pieces remained together until the final flare. The rubble pile simulation 

shows a mechanism through which that could happen by drafting structurally failed material in 

front or behind an intact boulder.  

If the rubble pile model of the approximate 1 m diameter Sariçiçek is scaled up to the 20 m diameter 

meteoroid the size of Chelyabinsk (Brown et al. 2013; Popova et al. 2013) the strengths should be 

reduced according to the Weibull distribution of fragment length scales. Terrestrial analogs show 

that the Weibull modulus holds constant for many rocks from centimeter size samples up to large 

rock masses tens or hundreds of meters across (e.g., National Research Council 1996; Bonnet et 

al. 1999), so it is not unreasonable to scale a 1 m rubble pile up to a 20 m rubble pile using a 

Weibull modulus to decrease the strength. For the measured modulus of 0.137, this gives a strength 

ratio of about a third (0.325), implying strengths of 1, 3, 10, and 30 MPa should be used.  

Without the Weibull scaling, the energy deposition curve of the 3–100 MPa rubble pile of Sariçiçek 

material on a Chelyabinsk trajectory shows a peak energy deposition at an altitude of 15 km instead 

of 30 km, with approximately the same peak energy deposition rate (Fig. 27). The point on the 

ground  directly  below  the  point  of  maximum  energy  deposition  would  be  moved  west  and  the 

overpressure at that point would be higher by a factor of 4–8 due to being twice as close to the 

ground and assuming either cylindrical or spherical shock wave expansion. However, 30 km away 

from the ground track, such as was seen at the city of Chelyabinsk, the overpressure would have 

44 

 
been very similar due to a similar amount of energy being deposited, a similar peak deposition 

rate, and a similar distance from the peak deposition location. 

Simulation of the Airburst 

The consequences on the ground are a function of the impact angle. The Sariçiçek airburst was 

modeled using the multimaterial, multiphysics, multidimensional CTH suite of computer codes 

that are designed for a wide range of shock wave propagation and material motion applications 

(McGlaun  et  al.  1990;  Boslough  and  Crawford  2008).  CTH  uses  finite-volume  analogs  of  the 

Lagrangian equations of momentum and energy with remapping at every time step for Eulerian 

differencing. It includes the option of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to increase resolution in 

regions of interest.  

The observed light curve (in 94 steps) was used as a proxy for energy deposition along the known 

flight path with known velocity and timing (e.g., Brown et al. 2013). For each time interval, a 

quantity of energy was deposited along a known segment of the trajectory into a cylindric volume 

containing a mass of air 10 times the mass ablated during the interval (assumed for this purpose to 

be proportional to the fraction of energy lost). The mass of the cylindrical parcel was increased by 

this amount, it was given an increment of internal energy, and it was inserted with a velocity along 

the path to conserve momentum.  

For these simulations, we exploited bilateral symmetry, with a rectangular half-space domain 160 

km along the ground track, 80 km in the lateral direction, and 80 km high. Six levels of refinement 

were  used,  with  a  minimum  zone  size  of  125  m  for  the  shock  wave  at  the  surface.  We  used  a 

gravitationally stabilized US Standard Atmosphere from sea level up to 80 km, and inserted the 

hot cylinders sequentially for the first 3.14 s of simulation time. 

Seismograms  were  calculated  at  the  position  and  altitude  of  the  seismic  stations,  but  without 

including actual topography of the terrain. Reflections from coupling to the ground are not in the 

model.  Thus  the  records  are  not  intended  to  be  synthetic  seismograms,  but  are  only  useful  for 

determining first arrival times for comparison to actual data.  

45 

 
Calculated results are in generally good agreement to observations (Fig. 6). Nearby stations have 

slightly earlier arrival times calculated than observed, but stations further out are a good match. 

The over pressure pattern on the ground (Fig. 28) shows an asymmetry similar to that observed in 

the  treefall  pattern  at  Tunguska  and  the  damage  pattern  at  Chelyabinsk,  with  stronger  shock 

propagation in the uprange and lateral directions and a weaker shock downrange. This is the result 

of  the  angle  of  entry  and  the  long  section  along  the  entry  trajectory  along  which  energy  is 

deposited,  with  shock  arrival  times  being  similar  at  those  locations  for  different  deposition 

altitudes.  

It is also instructive to look at the shape of the shock wave in the vertical symmetry plane, which 

can be seen in the distribution of kinetic energy (Fig. 28). This figure shows that the reason for the 

stronger  uprange  shock  is  because  the  shock  in  that  direction  has  a  cylindrical  shape  that  is 

diverging  less  (waves  closer  together)  than  the  spherically  shaped  shock  in  the  downrange 

direction of motion. 

Trajectory and Orbit 

The Sariçiçek fall provided the first pre-atmospheric impact orbit of a 22 Ma clan HED meteoroid. 

The measurements brought to light significant errors in the velocity vectors reported from U.S. 

Government (USG) satellite observations, enabled a search for pre-impact images of the meteoroid 

in  NEO  survey  programs,  and  provided  insight  into  the  source  region  of  the  22  Ma  clan  HED 

meteoroids in the asteroid main belt. 

Comparison to Satellite Data. 

Large errors in USG-detected fireball directions were recently reported (Jenniskens et al. 2018). 

The pre-entry velocity vector of Sariçiçek in ECF coordinates was given initially as VX = 5.1 km 

s‒1, VY = ‒6.3 km s‒1, VZ = ‒16.0 km s‒1, corresponding to a 17.9 km s‒1 entry speed (Fig. 3), 

later modified to VX = 10.3 km s‒1, VY = ‒12.2 km s‒1, VZ = ‒18.0 km s‒1, or 24.1 km s‒1entry 

speed (http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/fireballs/). Both solutions have the bolide arriving on a shallow path 

from the NE. The video-derived direction of the trajectory is ~74º rotated in azimuth to the west. 

Our  derived  entry  angle  of  53.4º  is  also  steeper  than  the  28º  calculated  from  the  ECF  vector 

46 

 
components. Our calculated entry speed of 17.1 ± 0.8 km s‒1 agrees with the 17.9 km s‒1 initially 

reported, not with the later value, but that may be coincidental given that the actual direction of 

the trajectory is quite different than reported from USG satellite observations.  

Dynamical Orbit and Search for Pre-Impact Observations 

Because the orbital elements for the Sariçiçek meteoroid were derived from serendipitous video 

observations, they are necessary less precise than the atmospheric trajectories and pre-atmospheric 

orbits  of  meteorites  that  fall  in  dedicated  photographic  all-sky  camera  networks.  However,  the 

results  are  sufficiently  accurate  to  investigate  the  possible  serendipitous  pre-impact  imaging  of 

Sariçiçek.  Assuming  the  estimated  diameter  of  1.0  m  and  an  albedo  of  0.15,  the  Sariçiçek 

meteoroid would have been an H = 32.7 magnitude object, which can be detected by NEO survey 

programs just prior to impact. Using methods described in Clark and Wiegert (2011), we generated 

1000  test  meteoroids  using  Gaussian  distributions  across  the  means  and  uncertainties  of  the 

Sariçiçek  first  detection  state  documented  in  Table  3.  The  test  meteoroid  probability  cloud 

members were integrated back in time using a RADAU integrator (Everhart 1985). The trajectory 

and expanse of the cloud was then matched against our 10,000,000+ sky survey image database 

which  includes  major  ground-base  surveys  (e.g.  Catalina,  PanSTARRS,  CFHT),  all  surveys 

contributing to the Minor Planet Centre Sky Coverage database, and space-based surveys (HST, 

WISE,  NEOWISE).  Visibility  of  the  object  was  calculated  using  the  asteroidal  diameter-

magnitude relationship of Bowell et al. (1989).  

Back integration of the contact state and uncertainties yields the 60-day prior to contact dynamical 

orbit shown in Table 3.  Sixty days was chosen as a somewhat arbitrary cutoff ensuring that the 

meteoroid is outside of Earth's influence, and any ongoing orbital changes are primarily due to 

precession. The small discrepancy in longitude of the ascending node is due to gravitational impact 

on the node being missed by analytic methods.  

The object’s near 23° inclination combined with its greater orbit speed result in near equal rate of 

change  in  solar  longitude,  and  apparent  vertical  decent  of  Sariçiçek  from  the  northern  ecliptic 

direction. As a result, the meteoroid phase angle was near 90° for much of its approach. 15 min 

47 

 
prior to contact Sariçiçek was an apparent magnitude m = 15.9 object with a phase angle Ø of 

103.9°. Its magnitude dropped quickly at greater distance and decreasing phase angle: m = 17.2, 

Ø = 98.6° at 30 min, m = 18.6, Ø = 94.9° at 1 h, m = 20.0, Ø = 92.7° at 2 h; reducing in to magnitude 

m = 24 (the approximate limiting magnitude of large surveys) and Ø = 90.5° 13 h prior to contact 

at just over 600,000 km (less than two lunar distances) from the Earth. 

Because of uncertainties in initial position and direction, the probability cloud is quite large. The 

cloud quickly expands to a 7° apparent width as we move 1 h back in time from contact, remaining 

approximately that apparent size for the preceding days as ongoing expansion is counteracted upon 

by distance. Our image database contains 62,729 images captured during the 2 months prior to the 

Sariçiçek impact. Only 12 images were found to contain any members of the probability cloud, 

these being images taken by Pan-STARRS on August 29 when the object was at m = 28.5 and 32.1 

respectively, well beyond the limiting magnitude of PanSTARRS. Based on counts of probability 

cloud elements that intersect these images, the probability that these images actually contained the 

object is low, ranging from 0.2% to 4.0%.  

It is difficult to make any statement on the visibility of Sariçiçek on prior passages through the 

ecliptic. Uncertainties in meteoroid contact velocity manifest themselves as uncertainties in orbit 

semimajor axis and period. Twenty-one months prior to contact, the first opportunity for a prior 

near  approach,  the  probability  cloud  has  dispersed  a  full  270°  in  true  anomaly,  making 

circumstances of a prior fly-by indeterminable. In the most opportune (and theoretical) of cases, 

the object would have been detectable for just over 1 day. 

Constraints on the Source Region from the Pre-Atmospheric Orbit 

Based on the Sariçiçek orbit, we estimate the likelihood for its entrance route (ER) into the NEO 

region using the NEO model presented in Granvik et al. (2016). The probabilities vary as a function 

of  the  absolute  magnitude  (a  proxy  for  the  physical  size),  throughout  the  modelled  diameter 

interval ranging from about 2 km to 30 m. The most likely ERs are in the Hungaria population and 

the inner Main Belt, with delivery via the n6 resonance (Fig. 29). The other ERs are substantially 

more unlikely with an estimated combined probability of about 5%. Among inner Main Belt ERs, 

48 

 
the relatively high inclination suggests that a high-inclination source such as Vesta or the Vesta 

asteroid family is the most probable if the Sariçiçek or its parent escaped the Main Belt through 

the n6 resonance.  

The high probability for a source in the Hungaria population is a consequence of the Hungaria-

like orbital inclination of Sariçiçek. However, the Hungaria population has very different spectral 

properties than Vesta (Kelley and Gaffey 2002), making it unlikely Sariçiçek originated from the 

Hungaria family.  

Constraints on the Source Crater of Normal 22 Ma Clan HED 

Can the Source Be the Disruption of a Vesta Family Asteroid? 

HED meteorites are often thought to be debris from the ongoing collisional disruption of Vesta's 

asteroid family, the Vestoids, members of which come to Earth preferably via the 3:1 resonance 

(Binzel et al. 2002; Davis et al. 2002, Moskovitz et al. 2008). This family consists of 0.8–8 km 

sized fragments from the formation of the large Rheasilvia basin and is the source of most V-class 

near-Earth asteroids (Ivanov and Melosh 2013).  

The 22 Ma clan of HED meteorites do not appear to originate directly from the V-class near-Earth 

asteroids, although these can experience collisions in the asteroid belt or disrupt in processes other 

than  collisions.  Such  disruptions  would  put  meteoroids  on  Earth-crossing  orbits  almost 

immediately and would not require another ~22 Ma to arrive at Earth.  

In a Main Belt population of V-class asteroids in collisional equilibrium with their surroundings, 

small fragments tend to represent a variety of CRE ages. Based on a collisional equilibrium size 

frequency  distribution  (Ivanov  and  Melosh  2013),  extrapolation  of  the  observed  population  of 

Vestoids into the small-size regime would result in about 3–7 ´ 107 asteroids of D ≥ 1 m diameter, 

after  taking  into  account  that  Yarkovsky  and  YORP  thermal  recoil  forces  quickly  remove  the 

smallest  asteroids  with  an  escape  rate  proportional  to  the  semi-major  axis  drift  rate,  which  is 

proportional to 1/D.  

49 

 
Only  collisions  involving  asteroids  with  D  ≥  0.3  km  would  be  capable  of  producing  sufficient 

meteoroids with similar CRE age to account for the 22 Ma clan of HED at Earth (see below). This 

would make the 525 km diameter Vesta a more likely place of that impact, because it has at least 

a five times larger cross section for collisions than that of all >0.3 km sized Vesta family members 

combined.  

Possible Source Crater on Vesta. 

NASA’s Dawn mission imaging of Vesta provides crater retention ages that constrain the location 

of possible source craters. Unfortunately, crater count derived ages have a factor of 2–5 systematic 

uncertainties, depending on the crater size range considered, due to the unknown population of 

small impactors. The distribution of projectile diameters below ~3 km is extrapolated either based 

on  computer  models  involving  collisional  evolution,  resulting  in  the  asteroid  flux  model 

chronology  system  (Marchi  et  al.  2012;  O'Brien  et  al.  2014),  or  based  on  the  observed  lunar 

cratering record of small craters, called the lunar surface chronology system (Schedemann et al. 

2014).  

Several craters with well-defined ejecta blankets overlaying old terrain have been dated by the 

Dawn  mission  team  by  counting  impacts  on  these  ejecta  blankets.  Figure  30  summarizes  the 

estimated formation age of Vesta craters as far as they are known now. Results are given in both 

chronology systems. 

The results show that in the lunar surface chronology system (black dots in Fig. 30), many of the 

smaller craters have ages in the range of CRE ages of HEDs. In contrast, the asteroid flux model 

chronology  system  (grey  dots  in  Fig.  30)  assigns  ages  >100  Ma  for  small  craters,  which  is 

significantly older than the 22 Ma clan of HED meteorites. In this scheme, none of the dated craters 

on Vesta could have produced these HED.  

The lunar surface chronology system provides a ~3.5 Ga formation age of the Rheasilvia basin 

(Yingst et al. 2014) that is contemporary with the ~3.6 Ga K-Ar age of Sariçiçek (Fig. 30). Most 

other  non-anomalous  HED  meteorites  experienced  such  collision  4.1–3.4  Ga  ago  based  on 

published Ar-Ar ages (Bogard and Garrison 2003; Bogard 2011) and the 3.8–3.3 Ga old impact 

50 

 
melt clasts in howardites (Cohen 2013). The asteroid derived chronology system suggests ~1.2 

Ga, instead (Marchi et al. 2012). The dynamical age of the Vestoids is at least 1 Ga, but an age of 

up  to  3.8  Ga  is  needed  to  account  for  outliers  at  semi-major  axis  2.3–2.5  AU.  The  observed 

combined  Vestoid  mass  is  consistent  with  a  collisional  and  dynamical  mass  loss  over  ~3.5  Ga 

(Moskovitz et al. 2008).  

Of  all  craters  on  Vesta,  the  relevant  craters  in  each  size  bracket  are  those  young  enough  to  be 

sharp-rimmed with a well defined ejecta blanket. Those happen to be also the ones studied by the 

Dawn team. Of all craters shown in Fig. 30 in the lunar surface chronology system, the relevant 

candidate source crater for the 22 Ma HED clan in each age bracket is the largest crater, which 

likely  produced  most  fragments.  Larger  craters  tend  to  be  older  because  the  impact  frequency 

increases sharply with decreasing impactor size. The formation age of the crater should be less 

than the highest HED cosmic ray exposure age of ~100 Ma, but not be so young that debris can 

not yet have reached Earth.  

The  larger  craters  Marcia,  Oppia  and  Octavia  (and  Publicia‒personal  communication)  were  all 

found 100–200 Ma old in the lunar surface chronology system, much older than the CRE age of 

most HED (Ruesch et al. 2014; Williams et al. 2014a, 2014b). Licinia is the youngest known large 

crater with a formation age in the range of measured CRE ages (Fig. 30). If the 49.5 ± 4.6 Ma date 

of Ruesch et al. (2014)  is accurate, Licinia is not responsible for the 22 Ma clan of HED. 

The next biggest crater is the 16.75 km diameter Antonia impact crater, which has an asymmetric 

ejecta blanket directed mostly downhill (Fig. 31). It is located on a slope in the Rheasilvia impact 

basin, where old terrain howardites overlay diogenite materials as a result of landslides and impact 

gardening. Only howardites contain the recent solar wind implanted noble gases, suggesting that 

a deposit of howardites covered eucrite- and diogenite-rich units at the time of the impact. Based 

on the scaled systematics of lunar surface chronology, crater size-frequency distributions on two 

different parts of the ejecta blanket of Antonia provided the ages of 18.5 ± 1.2 Ma (Antonia Ejecta 

East) and 23.7 ± 1.1 Ma (Antonia Ejecta West) (Kneissl et al. 2014), in good agreement with the 

measured CRE ages of 22 Ma clan HED and that of Sariçiçek (Fig. 31). Antonia Ejecta South gave 

an age of 12.9 ± 1.4 Ma, which is significantly younger, but this age was based on a smaller area 

51 

 
with much less craters (97 versus 477 and 348, respectively). While consistent in the lunar surface 

chronology system, the asteroid-derived chronology gives a factor of four higher ages (Fig. 30). 

Crater size-frequency distributions of the underlying terrain provided an age of 1.45 ± 0.64 Ga 

(Antonia ejecta West) in the same system (Kneissl et al. 2014). We noticed that this age is similar 

to the relatively low radiogenic retention ages derived for 4He in Sariçiçek SC12 (1.8 ± 0.7 Ga) 

and SC14 (2.6 ± 0.3 Ga). However, the 4He content are necessarily derived from different aliquots 

of  SC12  and  SC14  than  used  for  the  composition  measurement  (both  are  destructive 

measurements). Measured values of the U,Th concentrations are given in Tables 5 and 11, with U 

concentrations ranging from 34 ppb (SC12) to 57 ppb (SC26). Figure 32 shows how the derived 

U,Th-He  age  changes  if  the  U  concentration  in  the  measured  aliquot  was  different  from  that 

measured  in  another  part  of  the  same  stone.  Unless  both  the  SC12  and  SC14  aliquots  had 

significantly lower U (and Th) concentrations than measured for each stone, both ages fall below 

the common ~3.7 Ga peak of Ar-Ar ages in HED (Bogard 2011). The measured U,Th-He resetting 

ages are upper limits, because not all accumulated radiogenic He may have been lost from minerals 

in the smaller impacts that determine the terrain age. Indeed, SC12 could have been shocked more 

than the more fragile SC14. The terrain age around Antonia is also similar to young ~1.4 Ga 40Ar-

39Ar ages measured for feldspar grains close to a glass vein in the howardite Kapoeta (Lindsay et 

al. 2015).  

During the formation of that terrain, solar wind noble gases were implanted into the outer micron 

of individual soil particles of loose regolith on the surfaces of airless bodies (McKay et al. 1991). 

Impact gardening mixes those grains in the regolith, gradually accumulating noble gases. When 

that regolith is lithified by shocks to form a regolithic breccia assembly, only some of that gas is 

released. Sariçiçek's high content of solar wind implanted noble gases implies it was excavated 

from material that accumulated from soil particles at the surface of Vesta. Those particles included 

exogenous  matter  and  shocked  material  from  impacts  elsewhere  on  Vesta  (shocked  enough  to 

cause flattening of Fe and FeS). Sariçiçek's regolith exposure age of ~12–14 Ma may signify the 

regolith mixing timescale at the depth from which this meteoroid was excavated.

Dynamical Arguments for a Source Crater on Vesta. 

Using an ejecta scaling model (Housen and Holsapple 2011), 3–9 ´ 1011 kg of material can have 

escaped  the  gravity  of  Vesta  from  the  Antonia  impact.  Assuming  a  Weibull  size-frequency 

distribution  with  the  same  2.0  shape  parameter  exponent  as  the  Vestoids  (Ivanov  and  Melosh 

2013), but a scale parameter of 1.0 m, puts most mass in the size range of 0.25–1.25 m, with ~7 ´ 

107 fragments D ≥1-m in size and the largest fragment ~4 m.  

To  estimate  the  fraction  of  Earth  impactors  among  Vestoids  that  escape  the  main  asteroid  belt 

through  the  n6  secular  resonance,  we  reanalyzed  integrations  of  4153  test  asteroids  with  initial 

osculating orbital elements similar to the Vesta family 2.26 < a < 2.48 AU, 0.035 < e < 0.162, and 

5.0 < i < 8.3º until they end up in one of the predefined sinks: a collision with a planet or the Sun, 

or escape from the inner solar system (Granvik et al. 2016, 2017). Vesta itself is located near the 

center of the Vesta family, with proper elements a = 2.362 AU, e = 0.099, and i = 6.36º. Granvik 

et al. 2016, 2017) used an augmented version of the RMVS3 integrator implemented in the SWIFT 

package (Levison and Duncan 1994) that allows modeling of Yarkovsky drift in semimajor axis. 

The Yarkovsky force causes the test asteroids to drift towards the n6 secular resonance, the 3:1 

mean  motion  resonance  and  a  variety  of  minor  resonances  (Nesvorny  et  al.  2008),  which  then 

increases  their  eccentricity  until  the  test  asteroids  reach  the  near-Earth  space,  defined  as  a 

perihelion distance q < 1.3 AU. The short semimajor axis of Sariçiçek during impact suggests it 

drifted  towards  the  n6  secular  resonance.  At  this  stage,  Granvik  et  al.  (2016)  turned  off  the 

Yarkovsky  drift  because  it  becomes  negligible  compared  to  the  perturbations  caused  by  close 

planetary encounters. For modeling the Yarkovsky drift they assumed that all test asteroids have 

the same diameter D = 100 m. The assumption for diameter has a negligible effect on the orbital 

distribution for test asteroids entering the near-Earth space (Granvik et al. 2017), and the results 

can therefore be assumed representative also for 1 meter diameter class objects. Finally we find 

that 84 test asteroids (2.0 ± 0.2%) eventually impact the Earth. 

Yarkovsky and YORP forces determine the transfer efficiency from Vesta to the n6 resonance. 

Based on the integrations, it takes 79 Ma on average for 100 m sized Vestoids to evolve from their 

source in the Vesta asteroid family into a perihelion distance q = 1.3 AU orbit and another 14 Ma 

53 

 
to impact Earth (total 93 Ma). The manner in which the ejection conditions put Antonia ejecta into 

a slightly different regime of semi-major axis and eccentricity has little effect. The final phase is 

not size dependent, because it is dominated by gravitational perturbations. The early phase is size 

dependent, with smaller asteroids evolving faster into resonances. The canonical Yarkovsky drift 

rate of semimajor axis is 0.0002 AU/Ma for D = 1 km, and inverse scaling with D. For a 1 m 

meteoroid, that time is about 1.3 Ma. We conclude that it takes Antonia debris about 1.3 + 14 = 

15.3 Ma to reach Earth by way of the n6 resonance that delivered Sariçiçek.  

The 1.3 Ma time can be longer if YORP cycling is important. The idea behind YORP cycling is 

that YORP will spin-up a body until a deformation of the shape or fragmentation of the body will 

counteract further spin-up or even dramatically slow down the rotation rate (Bottke et al. 2015, 

Granvik et al. 2017). The obliquity of the spin axis is more easily changed, by, e.g., impacts from 

small meteoroids, when the rotation rate has slowed down. A change in the obliquity of the spin 

axis has a substantial effect on the drift rate in semimajor axis caused by the Yarkovsky effect. In 

the most extreme cases it may even change the direction of the Yarkovsky drift thereby leading to 

a Brownian-like drift in semimajor axis. YORP will eventually spin up the body again and the 

cycle  will  repeat.  In  recent  simulations  (Granvik  et  al.  2017),  it  was  found  that  accounting  for 

YORP  cycles  will  lead  to  a  net  Yarkovsky  drift  rate  that  is  comparable  to  an  instantaneous 

Yarkovsky  drift  rate  for  asteroids  two  orders  of  magnitude  larger.  That  is,  the  instantaneous 

Yarkovsky drift rate for 100 m sized objects (used in the simulations discussed above) corresponds 

to the net drift rate for 1 m sized objects with YORP cycling. If YORP cycling is important even 

for small 1 m sized meteoroids like Sariçiçek, then Antonia debris would take about 93 Ma to 

impact Earth. Such a long timescale is unlikely (cf. Granvik et al. 2017), given that this would 

produce much higher CRE ages than observed, but it does suggest that YORP may increase the 

travel time to somewhat higher than 15.3 Ma. 

The  observed  rate  of  impacts  (about  one  asteroid  with  D  ≥  1  m  every  4  years  globally)  is 

understood if Earth now experiences the wave of Antonia debris at its peak, and the duration of 

the wave is only 5–10 Ma.

Possible Source Craters of Other HED Meteorites. 

Meter-sized debris from Marcia, Oppia, Octavia, and Publicia have long passed. If Licinia's debris 

of age 49.5 ± 4.6 Ma (Ruesch et al. 2014) accounts for the CRE peak at ~54 Ma (Fig. 31), then 

some of Licinia's debris may still be on its way to Earth. Licinia could account for HED meteorites 

with CRE ages in the range 45–55 Ma (Fig. 30). The relatively large amount of debris that was 

excavated could explain why these meteoroids are still arriving at Earth in significant numbers. 

This would imply that the arrival time distribution at Earth has a long ~50 Ma tail, as perhaps 

expected from variable YORP cycling.  

After Antonia, the next biggest craters with ejecta blankets, 14.9 km Cornelia (dated to 9–14 Ma 

by Krohn et al. 2014), 11.6 km Fabia, and 11.3 km Canuleia can be responsible for other peaks in 

the CRE age distribution of Fig. 31. If so, these groups sample different terrains and may have 

different material properties.  

If 10.3 km wide Rubria (14–24 Ma according to Krohn et al. 2014) is contemporary with Antonia, 

it would add ~23% of ejecta to the Antonia peak based on the relative crater size. Rubria is located 

on the Rheasilvia ejecta blanket, but has reddish ejecta that may be unlike Sariçiçek. The reddish 

material has been interpreted as Rheasilvia impact melt or HED material rich in exogenic (non 

HED) material (Le Corre et al. 2013, 2015).  

Material from the young (~2.5 Ma: Ruesch et al. 2014) 10.5 km Arruntia crater is likely still on its 

way to the n6 resonance (Fig. 30). The next biggest, 8.1 km Sossia, and all smaller craters with 

ejecta blankets together ejected only ~60% of the ejecta mass of Antonia. Some of those impacts 

will be too young for material to have arrived at Earth.  

CONCLUSIONS 

The Sariçiçek meteoroid arrived at Earth on a 23º inclined orbit with a semimajor axis of ~1.44 

AU. It approached Earth in an apparent vertical descent from northern ecliptic latitudes, reaching 

+16 magnitude brightness with a 104º phase angle 15 min prior to contact with Earth's atmosphere, 

but in an area of the sky for which no archived images were found.  

55 

 
The impact created an airburst sufficient to trigger seismic sensors, albeit 300 times less powerful 

than the one that swept the city of Chelyabinsk. The 53º inclined entry angle in Earth's atmosphere 

and extended duration of energy deposition caused a more pronounced overpressure and sharper 

onset  in  the  backward  direction,  where  travel  times  from  different  sources  along  the  trajectory 

coalesced.  

The Sariçiçek meteorites consist of mostly lithic and mineral clasts of eucritic composition in a 

fine-grained  matrix  of  crushed  material.  The  diogenitic  component  of  this  eucrite-diogenite 

mixture exceeds 10 vol%, which defines this as a howardite.  

Oxygen, chromium (Cr), and titanium (Ti) isotopic compositions confirm that Sariçiçek originated 

from the same parent body as the HED clan of meteorites, excluding the anomalous eucrites. Bulk 

Sariçiçek (SC) rock chips of stones SC12 and SC14 have a mean Δ17O' = ‒0.31 ± 0.08 and ‒0.31 

± 0.06 (2s), respectively, with δ18O = 3.54 ± 0.20 and 3.60 ± 0.14, overlapping the normal HED 

ranges of Δ17O' = ‒0.247 ± 0.050 and δ18O = 3.74 ± 0.56 (2s). Cr and Ti isotope compositions of 

Sariçiçek are also normal, with. e54Cr = ‒0.66±0.07, e46Ti/47Ti = ‒0.19 ± 0.16, e48Ti/47Ti = +0.05 

± 0.16, and e50Ti/47Ti = ‒1.26 ± 0.21, compared to Bholghati's e54Cr = ‒0.63 ± 0.10, and Kapoeta's 

e46Ti/47Ti = ‒0.22 ± 0.05, e48Ti/47Ti = ‒0.14 ± 0.20, and e50Ti/47Ti ‒1.23 ± 0.04, respectively.  

Further  geochemical  analysis  of  Sariçiçek  sheds  new  light  on  the  origin  and  evolution  of  the 

howardite material. The 207Pb/206Pb ages of Sariçiçek apatites at 4524 ± 12 Ma (2s, 8 grains) are 

systematically younger by about 27 Ma compared to those of zircons at 4551.1 ± 2.8 Ma (2s, 30 

grains)  and  baddeleyites  at  4558.0  ±  8.2  Ma  (2s,  10  grains).  The  latter  coincide  in  age  with  a 

period  identified  earlier  as  the  peak  age  of  basaltic  magmatism  on  the  eucrite  parent  body, 

presumably when the crust of the parent body solidified. The possiblly younger zircon age is likely 

due to the progressive silica saturation in the magma where zircon formed later or metasomatic 

replacement of primary baddeleyite by silica-rich fluid or partial melt. The younger apatite-derived 

age suggests that the lower closure temperature for Pb diffusion in this phase allowed the grains 

to continue to equilibrate during thermal metamorphism for another ~27 Ma.  

56 

 
If the measured K composition is representative for the sample analysed for noble gas content, 

then the terrain in which Sariçiçek resided experienced at least one large impact able to reset the 

K-Ar  chronometer  ~3.6  Ga  ago.  Other  non-anomalous  HED  meteorites  experienced  such 

collision(s) 4.1–3.4 Ga ago, possibly from the formation of the, partially overlapping, Rheasilvia 

and Veneneia impact basins.  

If the measured U and Th composition is representative, stones SC12 and SC14 have U,Th-He 

ages of 1.8 ± 0.7 Ga and 2.6 ± 0.3 Ga, respectively, younger than the K-Ar ages. These ages are 

interpreted to be due to radiogenic 4He loss from smaller impacts that continued to affect the terrain 

where Sariçiçek was excavated.  

In recent times, Sariçiçek was situated close to the terrain surface. It is rich in noble gas isotopes 

from  solar  wind  implantation,  with  20Ne  =  1.8  nL  g‒1  STP,  and  in  siderophile  elements  from 

chondritic contamination, with an iridium abundance of 8–10 ng g‒1.  

Both noble gas implantation and cosmogenic radionuclides show Sariçiçek was a meteoroid and 

exposed to cosmic rays during the past 22 ± 2 Ma. Thus, the Sariçiçek orbit is specifically relevant 

to the common HED group with cosmic ray exposure ages of 19–26 Ma. There is evidence of prior 

exposure  for  12–14  Ma,  when  the  meteoroid  was  still  part  of  a  larger  body,  confirming  that 

Sariçiçek was located close to the surface at the time of the collision.  

Based on the meteorite's natural thermoluminescence, the orbit did not evolve much closer to the 

Sun than the 1.0 AU distance at impact. Of all near-Earth objects approaching in such inclined and 

short orbits, ~66% are expected to originate from the 16–34º inclined Hungaria asteroid family 

and ~31% from lower inclined sources in the inner Main Belt that deliver through the n6 resonance. 

Hungaria asteroids do not have Sariçiçek's two prominent pyroxene absorption bands at 0.93 ± 

0.01 and 1.98 ± 0.02 μm wavelength, but Vesta and the 5–8º inclined Vesta asteroid family (the 

Vestoids) do, which are located in the inner Main Belt. 

The 16.7 km Antonia impact crater on Vesta is large enough to account for the influx of 10 cm to 

1 m sized HED to Earth, given the fraction that can escape the gravity of Vesta, the time it takes 

to  evolve  into  a  Sariçiçek-like  impact  orbit,  and  the  fraction  of  meteoroids  that  impact  Earth. 

57 

 
Antonia was formed on terrain of the same age as given by the  4He retention age of Sariçiçek. 

Lunar scaling for crater production to crater size-frequency distributions of its ejecta blanket show 

it was formed ~22 Ma ago, contemporary with the CRE age of the 22 Ma clan of HED meteorites. 

Sariçiçek represents a typical 1.0 ± 0.2 m diameter sample of Antonia impact ejecta, terrain from 

the Rheasilvia impact basin where most V-class asteroids originated. The pre-atmospheric size of 

Sariçiçek was determined from cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations of  10Be,  36Cl, and  26Al 

and is consistent with the observed optical luminosity and infrasound energy.  

This suggests that some material properties of Sariçiçek, such as the Weibull coefficient for the 

fracture length scale distribution, may be representative for large V-class asteroids. The manner in 

which  Sariçiçek  fragmented  in  Earth's  atmosphere,  depositing  its  kinetic  energy  at  37–27  km 

altitude  and  generating  an  airburst  that  was  detected  at  the  surface,  provided  ground  truth  for 

models designed to forecast the damage from future Vestoid impacts.

All ages given in Ma (million years). Nominal ages are given in parentheses, while the regolith exposure corrected 
ages are given without parentheses. “PR or concentration” = U, Th, K concentration in ppm or the production rate (*) 
in  10‒8  cm3  STP  g‒1  Ma  calculated  using  the  formulas  given  by  Eugster  and  Michel  (1995)  and  the  elemental 
composition of Table 5. Cosmogenic radionuclide data suggest that production rates in SC14 are about 8%, 19%, and 
17% higher for He, Ne, Ar than in SC12 (Leya and Masarik 2009); therefore, the given rates have been multiplied by 
an additional correction factor to determine the exposure ages given in the last column. aFor SC14, the 4π 38Ar-age 
could not be determined as the “regolith trend line” for Ar is negative.
