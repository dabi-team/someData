Abstract: We report on the recent development of a versatile analog front-end compatible with
a negative-ion µ-TPC for a directional dark matter search as well as a dual-phase, next-generation
O(10 kt) liquid argon TPC to study neutrino oscillations, nucleon decay, and astrophysical neutrinos.
Although the operating conditions for negative-ion and liquid argon TPCs are quite diﬀerent (room
temperature vs. ∼88 K operation, respectively), the readout electronics requirements are similar.
Both require a wide-dynamic range up to 1600 fC, and less than 2000–5000 e− noise for a typical
signal of 80 fC with a detector capacitance of Cdet ≈ 300 pF. In order to fulﬁll such challenging
requirements, a prototype ASIC was newly designed using 180-nm CMOS technology. Here, we
report on the performance of this ASIC, including measurements of shaping time, dynamic range,
and equivalent noise charge (ENC). We also demonstrate the ﬁrst operation of this ASIC on a
low-pressure negative-ion µ-TPC.

Introduction

We report on a custom analog front-end electronics system developed by the KEK-Kobe University
joint project LTARS (Low-Temperature Analog Readout System). The project goal was to establish
an analog readout system for the NEWAGE directional dark matter experiment (NEw general Wimp
search with an Advanced Gaseous tracker Experiment) [1], and for a next-generation neutrino
oscillation experiment [2].

The NEWAGE detector is a µ-TPC (micro-Time Projection Chamber), which uses an MPGD
(Micro Patterned Gaseous Detector), e.g., µ-PIC [3] or Micromegas (Micro-MEsh Gaseous Struc-
ture) [4] to read out the TPC. NEWAGE aims to detect the directional signature of galactic dark
matter [5, 6]. Typically, TPCs operate in electron-drift mode: a charged nuclear recoil ionizes
the surrounding low-pressure gas to generate electron-ion pairs. An electric ﬁeld then transports
the electrons to a readout plane where they are ampliﬁed and collected by the MPGD. µ-TPCs can
therefore record a recoil track in three dimension. While three-dimensional tracking is possible with
this approach, diﬀusion limits the drift length of the detector. To suppress diﬀusion and improve
track reconstruction, a negative-ion drift gas can be used, in which ionization electrons attach to

– 1 –

electronegative gas molecules to form negative ions [7]. The negative ions are then transported to
the readout plane. These TPCs are called negative-ion (NI) µ-TPCs. The DRIFT experiment uses
a NI TPC, and has demonstrated diﬀusion at the thermal limit [8].

In addition to reduced diﬀusion, the use of a NI µ-TPC also enables full-volume ﬁducialization
through 3D position reconstruction of the event vertex [9]. Because the main backgrounds of
TPC-based dark matter searches are α-particles and daughter nuclei from 238U/232Th chain decays
of isotopes on the MPGD and drift planes, ﬁducialization can enable background-free operation
[8, 10]. Fiducialization along the drift direction is possible because NI gases can produce multiple
species of charge carriers, each with diﬀerent mass and therefore mobility. As a result, the diﬀerence
of arrival times between species correlates with total drift distance. For example, nuclear recoils in
SF6 primarily produce SF−
5 (so-called a “minority carrier”), whose
mobility is ≈ 5% larger [11]. Because the time-scale for events in a NI µ-TPC is orders of magnitude
longer than for an electron-drift TPC, new electronics, such as the LTARS, are required to read out
these detectors.

6 , but also trace amounts of SF−

In addition to improving the sensitivity of directional dark matter searches, the LTARS system
can also beneﬁt large-scale liquid argon (LAr) detectors. An O(10 kt) LAr time projection chamber
(LAr-TPC) will be utilized for next-generation neutrino oscillation studies, and also for studies of
nucleon decay and astrophysical neutrinos. Toward the realization of such a large detector, a world-
wide R&D eﬀort on kilo-ton-scale LAr-TPC demonstrators is underway [12]. One approach to
reading out the ionization electron signal uses a dual-phase LAr-TPC [13]. In the dual-phase TPC,
the ionization electrons are extracted from the liquid to the vapor phase, and extracted electrons are
multiplied with a thick-GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) and collected with a two-dimensional strip
anode. The main advantage of a dual-phase readout is the high signal-to-noise ratio aﬀorded by
the gas multiplication. This enables longer drift lengths over which some primary electrons are lost
to impurities in the LAr. The high signal-to-noise ratio also beneﬁts the physics sensitivity for the
neutrino oscillation, nucleon decay, and astrophysical neutrino signals.

6 /SF−

Both the directional dark matter search and LAr TPCs for neutrino experiments require inno-
vations in readout electronics. Since the drift speed of negative-ions is orders of magnitude smaller
than that of electrons in a low-pressure gas (≈ 10−2 cm/µs vs. ≈ 1 cm/µs), existing electronics
designed for high-rate TPC readout in collider experiments are too fast to collect charges from NI
µ-TPC. Additionally, since the minority carrier signal strength is typically only a few percent of the
primary signal in optimized gas conditions, a wide dynamic range is also required for the electronics
to sense SF−
5 with high signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., typical signals are 3 fC for minority species
and 80 fC for the main species). Also, ﬁne MPGD spatial resolution necessitates a high-channel
count readout in a small form-factor (e.g., 1500 channels for a 30 × 30 cm2 readout area with strip
pitch of 400 µm). The signal timescale for LAr-TPCs is similar to that of the NI µ-TPC since the
ionization electrons drift in the liquid (the drift speed is typically ≈ 10−1 cm/µs). The wide dy-
namic range requirement also applies to the LAr-TPC. The typical ionization signal for a minimum
ionization particle (MIP) track is ≈ 10 fC depending on the thick-GEM gain. A single-channel
signal for events associated with electromagnetic or hadronic showers is ∼50 times larger than for a
MIP. The number of readout channels is expected to be O(105) for a O(10 kt) detector. Moreover, to
minimize detector capacitance, the analog front-end electronics must be located as close as possible
to the strip readout. As a consequence, the analog front-end must operate at ∼88 K.

In this article, we report on the recent development and characterization of a prototype analog
front-end ASIC, which meets the needs of both NI µ-TPC and LAr-TPC detectors. We describe the
ASIC design in section 2, report on the test results in section 3, discuss the design reﬁnements in
section 4, and give conclusions in section 5. The characterization of 88 K operation is out of scope
of the present paper. The full detail of the cryogenic operation is going to be described in a next
paper.

2 Speciﬁcation of the ASIC

2.1 Overview of the ASIC

The readout ASIC was implemented with Silterra 180-nm CMOS technology with a chip size of
5 × 5 mm2. The objectives of the prototype were to establish operation of basic signal processing
components such as a preampliﬁer and CR-RC shaper stage, and to demonstrate the successful
operation of these elements on a detector. For evaluation purposes, we implemented two diﬀerent
signal processing chains in the ASIC: (a) a pair of static gain stages to handle wide (±1600 fC)
and narrow (±80 fC) dynamic-range signals (hereafter referred as “static architecture”), and (b) a
dynamic gain-switching architecture (hereafter “dynamic architecture”). Each ASIC implements
eight independent channels of each architecture. Table 1 lists the speciﬁcation and performance
requirements of the ASIC, and Figure 1 shows a photograph of the ASIC. Signals are processed
from left to right on the chip. The main circuit core occupies the central quarter of the ASIC. The
remainder of the chip houses bias nodes for the two architectures and decoupling capacitors.

2.2 Circuit Properties

2.2.1 Static gain architecture

Figure 2 shows the block diagram of a single channel of the static architecture. The detector
is externally AC-coupled with electro-static discharge protection diodes to the charge-sensitive
ampliﬁer (CSA) input. Calibration test pulses can be injected via an on-chip capacitor of 100 fF.
The CSA implements a modiﬁed folded cascode topology with a large input NMOS transistor (W/L
= 40 µm/300 nm, M = 100, gm/Id=7.5 mS/280 µA). The bias condition of input and load transistors

located in the central region, and the remainder of the chip houses decoupling capacitors to stabilize the bias
and power supplies.

are adjusted independently by acquiring constant currents from the VDD and VSS. A transfer gate-
type PMOS is employed for the CSA DC-feedback component. The CSA is designed to handle
signals of either polarity, and includes pole-zero cancellation. The CSA drives a 2-stage shaping
ampliﬁer, whose output is shared by high- and low-gain ampliﬁers whose gains are optimized for
narrow and wide dynamic-range signals (see Table 1). Although the time constants of each stage in
Fig. 2 seem to be set at 3 µs/1.5 µs (Csh1Rsh1) and 3.6 µs/1.2 µs (Csh2Rsh2), respectively, the overall
response becomes slower since the PZC (pole-zero cancellation circuit) is directly connected to the
CSA output instead of the source follower’s output as a popular conﬁguration. We thus carefully
designed for a default peaking time of 7 µs/3.5 µs by SPICE simulation. In this work, we focus
on the 7 µs performance. All resistor components are implemented with high-value poly resistors
(1.05 KΩ/sq.).

2.2.2 Dynamic gain-switching architecture

The signal processing chain for the dynamic gain switching architecture is shown in Figure 3. The
circuit is based on Ref. [14]. The CSA uses a folded cascode conﬁguration with an input PMOS
transistor, and the CSA DC-feedback FET is implemented with NMOS. The feedback capacitor
is selectable via a CMOS switch (designated as COMP_FBIN) between 340 fC and 8.58 pF for
narrow-range and wide-range modes, respectively. This gain setting of either “L” or “H” (at ﬁrst
set as “H” with high-gain) is provided from a discriminator output after comparison with the CSA
output and an external threshold voltage. An RS latch is inserted between the gain switch and the
discriminator to prevent unexpected bit transition during the signal processing. After ﬁnishing each
event process, the latched gain setting is reset from an external DAQ (or FPGA) board. The CSA
output is fed into a band-pass ﬁlter circuit with pole-zero cancellation and a second-order low-pass
ﬁlter. The latter utilizes two sets of high-resistance circuits, functioning as a selectable mega Ω
resistor by implementing with a poly resistor of 66/330 kΩ and current mirrors [15]. The transfer

By choosing C1R1 = 4C2R2, the transfer function becomes T(s) = −
second order low-pass ﬁlter. The peaking times are selectable via the CMOS switch of the resistor
circuits R1 & R2. Circuit conﬁguration, such as test pulse enable and peaking time selection, is
done by daisy chained shift registers.

3 Measurement Results

3.1 Experimental setup

To evaluate the circuit properties, the ASIC was directly mounted on a test board before connecting
to a detector. A computer interface was established using a commercially available digital board

for the dynamic architecture.

with a Xilinx FPGA (the SOY board from Bee Beans Technology [16]). All necessary bias voltages
for the ASIC were provided from potentiometers and resistors on the PCB.

3.2 Waveforms

Figure 4 shows the high-gain outputs for each architecture for an input charge of −50 fC. In the static
architecture (left panel), the peak pulse height is measured to be −512 mV for a peaking time of
5.4 µs. The simulation predicts a smaller pulse amplitude (−426 mV) and a slightly slower peaking
time (6.7 µs).

As for the dynamic architecture, we needed bias optimization before injecting test pulses. This
is because the default bias settings obtained from simulation did not provide appropriate conditions
to the ASIC, and we observed the following phenomena: (1) the measured pulse height was 2–3
times smaller than the simulation for the default bias voltages, and (2) the eﬀect of the detector
capacitance Cdet was worse than predicted, i.e.
the gain decreases rapidly as Cdet increases. We
describe these issues in detail in Section 5. After increasing the bias voltage on the VM node by
0.5 V (see Figure 3), analog outputs were observed from the chip, as shown in the right panel of
Figure 4. Even after bias optimization, however, the measured waveform peaking time (∼ 11 µs)
does not match expectation, and the pulse height was still small by 10%.

Next, we characterized the dynamic gain-switching response. Figure 5 shows screen shots
for injected charges of 90 fC and 100 fC, respectively. The threshold level was set between those
values. We can clearly see that the output of COMP_FBIN (indicated in green at the bottom) in the
left ﬁgure remains in the low state below the threshold, while the expected transition is seen in the
right panel when the shaper output crosses threshold. A short spike in the shaper output of the
right panel seems to coincide with a rising edge of COMP_FBIN, however, this is an artifact caused
by noise injection due to coupling between oscilloscope probes. The switching noise from the
CMOS switch seems clearly removed in the band-pass ﬁlter, and the waveform shows the expected
semi-gaussian shape.

3.3 Voltage gain and Dynamic range

Figure 6 shows measurements of the dynamic range for each architecture. The lower panels show
the ratio of the measurements and a linear ﬁt between ±80 fC for high-gain and ±1000 fC for

low-gain, respectively. A ±10% level is also presented in dashed lines. This level is deﬁned
as a negligible range, compared with an energy resolution of the gas detectors of typically 20%,
including a position dependence of the MPGD [17]. For the static architecture, the measured gains
are 10.05 mV/fC and 0.54 mV/fC, respectively, which meet the LTARS design speciﬁcation. For the
fast peaking time mode (3.5 µs), the measured gains are 10.29 mV/fC and 0.51 mV/fC, which also
meet the design speciﬁcation. For the dynamic architecture, the measured gains are 7.05 mV/fC
and 0.49 mV/fC (7 µs peaking time), and 7.33 mV/fC and 0.51 mV/fC (1 µs peaking time).

The low-gain dynamic ranges for both architectures look narrower than the design speciﬁcation
of ±1600 fC. However, by adjusting the output baseline oﬀset, the speciﬁcation can be achieved. For
standard operation, this is a satisfactory approach because the ASICs operate with a pre-determined
polarity.

3.4 Noise characteristics

The simulated and measured equivalent noise (rms) as a function of detector capacitance is shown
in Figure 7. The simulation includes parasitic resistance and capacitance of the core circuits. The

– 7 –

noise slopes are roughly consistent with the simulation for both architectures, however, we can
clearly see a noise oﬀset of ∼1000 e−. The origin of that excess noise oﬀset is under investigation,
however the 2 mm-long metal traces with a width of 3 µm between the ASIC pads and the CSA
inputs are likely contributing and/or easily aﬀected by external noises. On the other hand, the
measured ENCs of the low-gain modes meet the design requirements for a detector capacitance of
300 pF: 6950 e− for the static architecture and 3.5×104 e− for the dynamic architecture. Although
the noise measurement for the dynamic architecture was made without activating the gain-switching
circuit, the noise contribution from CMOS switching is negligibly small (∼3%) compared with the
ENC in the low-gain mode.

4 Demonstration with a Micromegas detector

4.1 Experimental setup

After characterizing the full chip functionality, we connected the LTARS test boards to a NI µ-TPC
with Micromegas readout to assess the performance on a detector. The detector was developed as a
prototype directional dark matter detector at Wellesley College in the USA. The experimental setup
and the schematic readout diagram are shown in Figure 8. The experiment was performed with an
α-ray source and the tracking capability for α-rays was demonstrated.

The Micromegas was made by CERN with an ampliﬁcation area and gap of 10 × 10 cm2 and
256 µm, respectively [18]. The drift length was 1.5 cm and a radioactive source of 210Po was
placed 5 mm away from the Micromegas. SF6 gas with a pressure of 60 Torr was used as a NI-drift
gas. The high voltages of the drift plane and mesh were −1525 V and −625 V, which formed a
drift electric ﬁeld of 0.6 kV/cm. The gas gain was ∼100. A two-dimensional strip readout with a
high-resistivity strip layer for spark protection on the top was used. The pitch of the readout and
protection strips was 200 µm. The strip patterns were formed on a ﬁlm with a thickness of 50 µm.
Three ﬁlms, namely Y-strips (bottom), X-strips (middle) and resistive-strips (top), were layered.
The resistive strips were parallel to the Y-strips. The α-source was mounted such that the mean

Figure 8. Experimental setup (left) and schematic readout diagram (right). Two of the four TOSHIZOU2
test boards (blue) mounted on the lateral sides of the setup are visible in the photograph.

α-particle direction was parallel to the X-strips. A total of 32 strips (16 consecutive X-strips and
16 consecutive Y-strips) covering a detection area of 3.2 × 3.2 mm2 were connected to four test
boards, labeled as TOSHIZOU2 in Figure 8. The closest Y-strip to the α-source was used as a
trigger. The analog outputs from the test boards were digitized at 2.5 MHz by the FPGA board. The
resulting digital data was recorded by a PC. All data were taken with the static gain architecture in
the high-gain, slow peaking time mode to reduce electronic noise. The noise levels were 16 mVrms,
corresponding to an ENC of 9937 e−. The detector capacitance per strip (10 cm long) was measured
to be 50 pF. This value is approximately four times larger than the estimation from Fig. 7. However,
periodic noise is clearly visible in the waveforms of Fig. 10, indicating that the remaining noise
originates elsewhere in the experimental setup.

4.2 Track reconstruction

Figures 9 and 10 show sample waveforms from each strip for a single α-event. Some channels in
the Y-strips were broken during the measurement. In this two-dimensional readout with resistive
strips on the top, positive charges are induced when the ampliﬁed electrons are collected at the
high-resistive strip. Thus, the polarities of observed waveforms from both strips are consistent with
expectation. While we can see the TPC-like signal propagation of fast signals clearly in the Y-strips
(top waveforms ﬁrst and bottom waveforms last), the induced signals in X-strips are much longer in
duration than Y-strips. The X-strip waveforms seen in Figure 9 have long duration because charges
propagate in the high-resistive strips (parallel to the Y-strips) with a time constant of O(10∼100) µs
and induce extra hits in the X-strips. Although three-dimensional track reconstruction was hindered
due to this eﬀect, we successfully demonstrated that the LTARS ASIC could successfully read out
signal charges from the Micromegas with a very low gain of ∼100 and a strip pitch of 200 µm.

5 Discussion for performance improvements

In this section, we address the discrepancy between the measured and simulated performances for
each architecture, and discuss design improvements for the next version of the LTARS ASIC. The
static architecture meets the design speciﬁcation, but with slightly larger gain than expected (see
Figure 4, left). This discrepancy cannot be explained by the transistor’s corner parameters. We

each channel is oﬀset for clarity. The upper strip is closest to the α-source, and peaks earliest in time. This
track thus pointed away from the Micromegas.

speculate instead that process variation of the poly resistor is the cause, i.e., three high-value poly
resistors are placed in series with the minimum design width and dummy structures for a large
resistance of 600 kΩ in the ﬁrst shaping ampliﬁer (Rsh1 in Fig. 2). Since the poly resistors are
formed by chemical etching on metal layers in this technology, the absolute resistance accuracy is
typically 10% even with dummy structures, when the poly width follows the minimum rule. If we
denote Rsh1 as the feedback resistor in the ﬁrst shaping ampliﬁer (see Fig. 2), the voltage gain which
is proportional to Rsh1 becomes larger than expected under over-etching condition.

On the other hand, the performance discrepancies of the dynamic architecture cannot be
explained only by the process variation since the circuit does not include poly resistors over 330 kΩ
in the high-resistance circuit. The origin is likely due to the transconductance gm of the input
PMOS in the preampliﬁer (W/L = 11.2 µm/ L = 200 nm, M = 100). The hypothesis that the

dynamic architecture performance is aﬀected by gm also explains other observations. Due to the
Miller Eﬀect, the eﬀective input capacitance of the ampliﬁer is Cf (1 + A), where Cf is the feedback
capacitance and A is the open-loop gain of the ampliﬁer. Hence, the fraction of charge generated in
, where A = gm × ro, and ro is the
the detector and absorbed by Cf is written as
output impedance of the preampliﬁer. Ideally, gm is suﬃciently large, and the Cdet dependence can
be ignored. The gm that is smaller than intended will degrade the S/N. This is consistent with the
observation in the Cdet vs. gain curve, which was worse than the design. A small gm also aﬀects
the output peaking time. The rise time of the CSA is generally given as tr = Cdet
, where

µ0 ≡
large gm (ideal case), the rise time of the preampliﬁer is fast, while the rise time becomes longer
with decreasing gm (current case). As a result, a slower waveform is observed at the ﬁnal output
stage (Figure 4, right). This is caused through multiple factors: (i) the expected Id i.e. designed as
I=500 µA, is not supplied to the PMOS even under the maximum external bias, due to insuﬃcient
transistors’ W/L in bias current mirrors, and (ii) gm is sensitive to the VM node since the node is
not only connected to the source of the input FET, but also to the gate of the cascode transistor
(Fig. 3). If we consider the IR drop in the VM node, the decrease of gm is a reasonable conclusion.
Figure 11 shows the simulation result of gm vs. Id of the input PMOS under various VM condition.
After the optimization of the bias current mirrors, we separated the gate of cascode FET from the
VM line, and also increased the ﬁnger number of the cascode FET. The improved gm is overlaid in
Fig. 11.

The remaining issue is the ENC. This should be considered from experimental viewpoints. As
shown in Table 1 and Figure 7, the targeted noise level of less than 2000 e− (rms) was not achieved
in the current design. If we relax the S/N constraint to 5, fake events appear at 0.2 Hz in one strip,
taking account of the band-width of ∼ 100 kHz. In the µ-TPC experiment, we normally read out
multiple strips for each event, and the fake events can be easily recognized if the noise rate is about
0.2 Hz. We thus reset the design speciﬁcation of ENC to 4000 e− (S/N=5) and we will improve the
layout to achieve the design speciﬁcation in the next submission.

6 Conclusion

For the purpose of reading out NI µ-TPC and LAr-TPCs, we have newly developed a dedicated
analog ASIC in 180-nm CMOS technology. To meet the wide dynamic range of 1600 fC with
a detector capacitance of 300 pF, the ASIC contains two diﬀerent readout architectures: one was
constructed with a static and separate gain-stages and another was implemented with a dynamic gain-
switching topology. We mounted the ASIC on a test board and compared the ASIC performance to
a SPICE simulation, in terms of shaping time, dynamic range, and ENC. For the static architecture,
the shaping time and dynamic range meet the design speciﬁcations. For the dynamic architecture,
the gain switching works as designed, however, some design issues were found in the preampliﬁer
circuit. By using a multi-ﬁnger cascode FET and separating the source of the input FET and gate of
the cascode FET in the preampliﬁer, we expect to ﬁx the problem, and achieve the required noise level
in the next version of the ASIC. The ENCs of both architectures are still larger than desired, however,
the excess noise is likely due to the long metal routing between a wirebonding pad and an analog
input. This issue can be improved by optimizing the layout. In anticipation of cryogenic operation,
we carefully chose the gate lengths of devices to reduce the impact ionization probability at 88 K.
At low temperature, the CMOS transconductance increases due to the increased carrier mobility,
which is expected to improve the noise performance.
In order to assess such cryogenic eﬀects,
however, the overall noise performance must be improved. Therefore the cryogenic characterization
of the LAr-TPC will be done with the next design. We conclude that the static architecture reaches
the requirements for an actual NI µ-TPC dark-matter experiment. We also demonstrated the ASIC
front-end on an NI µ-TPC with Micromegas gas ampliﬁcation and 200 µm-pitch strip electrodes.
