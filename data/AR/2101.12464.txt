Abstract

∆ + aR (a > 0) under the backward Ricci ﬂow on locally
Let λ(t) be the ﬁrst eigenvalue of
homogeneous 3-manifolds, where R is the scalar curvature.
In the Bianchi case, we get the
upper and lower bounds of λ(t). In particular, we show that when the the backward Ricci ﬂow
converges to a sub-Riemannian geometry after a proper re-scaling, λ+(t) approaches zero, where

∆ + R/4 under the Ricci ﬂow, where

The research on the eigenvalues of operators under geometric ﬂows has attracted many at-
In a seminal paper [29], Perelman depicted the nondecreasing behavior of the ﬁrst
tentions.
∆ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator, R
eigenvalue of
denotes the scalar curvature. As an application, he proved the non-existence of nontrivial steady
or expanding breathers on closed manifolds. Perelman’s results were extended by Cao [2] to the
operator
2 on manifolds with nonnegative curvature operator under the Ricci ﬂow. Li [24]
removed Cao’s curvature assumption and got the similar conclusion. One may refer to [3, 5, 27]
0) and refer to [32, 31] for the p-Laplace op-
for more studies about the operator

erator. In particular, the upper and lower bounds of eigenvalues were obtained by analyzing the
evolution equation on closed Riemann surfaces [5, 32].

There are also many results under other geometric ﬂows. In [25], Li obtained the monotonic-
ity of eigenvalues under various re-scaled versions of Ricci ﬂow. For the normalized powers of
the mth mean curvature ﬂow, Zhao [33] established the monotonicity of the ﬁrst eigenvalue of
p-Laplace operator under certain conditions. Under the harmonic-Ricci ﬂow, Li [26] studied the
the eigenvalues and entropies. Fang and Yang [11] investigated the ﬁrst eigenvalue of the oper-

the Yamabe ﬂow. Along the re-scaled List’s extended Ricci ﬂow, Huang and Li [19] considered
monotonicity formulae of eigenvalues of the Laplacian and entropies. For the monotonicity of
eigenvalues and quantities along the Ricci-Bourguignon ﬂow, one may refer to [9, 30]. Related
results also include [1, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 28].

In general, it’s diﬃcult to get the upper and lower bounds of eigenvalues of geometric op-
erators under ﬂows. The obstacle is that the metric is variable, hence the classical methods,
such as gradient estimates of eigenfunctions, heat kernel estimates et al., can not be employed
directly. While on closed surfaces, by controlling the scalar curvature, we studied the derivative
of the eigenvalue, then got the upper and lower bounds of eigenvalues by integration [5]. But
the approach is not available for high dimensional manifolds. In order to explore possibilities
on locally homogeneous 3-manifolds, we developed a new method to estimate the eigenvalues
by comparing components of the Ricci curvature [16, 17]. Similar methods were also taken by
R under the Ricci ﬂow. In this paper,
Korouki and Razavi [23] to study the eigenvalue of
∆ + aR under the backward Ricci ﬂow on locally
we consider the eigenvalues of the operator
homogeneous 3-manifolds, where a is a positive constant.

There are nine classes of locally homogeneous 3-manifolds. These classes can be divided
R, where
into two families. According the classiﬁcation in [20], H(3), H(2)
H(n) means the group of isometries of hyperbolic n-space, belong to the ﬁrst family. Six other
classes R3, SU(2), SL(2, R), Heisenberg, E(1, 1) (the group of isometries of the plane with ﬂat
Lorentz metric) and E(2) (the group of isometries of the Euclidian plane) belong to the second
family which is called the Bianchi case.

In the Bianchi case, there is a Milnor frame (X1, X2, X3) which can diagonalize the initial
metric and the Ricci tensor. The property that the Ricci ﬂow keeps the diagonalization enables
us to write

g = A(t)θ1

θ1 + B(t)θ2

θ2 + C(t)θ3

θ3,

where (θ1, θ2, θ3) is the frame dual to (X1, X2, X3). Hence we reduce the Ricci ﬂow to an ODE
system in (A, B, C). The following backward Ricci ﬂow

∂t

(1.1)

was studied in [4, 6]. An interesting phenomenon is that after a proper re-scaling, the ﬂow
converges uniformly to a sub-Remannian geometry in many cases. For more results about the
Ricci ﬂow on locally homogeneous manifolds, we refer the reader to [18, 21, 22] and so on.

We obtain the following theorem which extends the results in [16].

Theorem 1. Let (M, g(t)), t
[0, T+), be a solution to the backward Ricci ﬂow in the Bianchi
case where T+ is the maximal existence time. Let λ(t) be the ﬁrst eigenvalue of
0.
When the ﬂow converges to a sub-Riemannian geometry after a proper re-scaling, λ+(t) goes to
zero as t

Since the ﬁrst eigenvalue of the Laplacian is nonnegative and the convergence is described
∆ + aR, a > 0. The remaining part of this
in [16], we only study the eigenvalue of the operator
paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we introduce an evolution equation of the eigenvalue
under the backward Ricci ﬂow. Since the analysis on R3 is trivial, from Section 3 to Section 7, we
only investigate the behaviors of eigenvalues on Heisenberg, SU(2), E(1, 1), E(2) and SL(2, R)
case by case.

For a given metric g0, there exists a Milnor frame such that

[X2, X3] = 2X1, [X3, X1] = 0, [X1, X2] = 0.

Let A0, B0, C0 be the initial value of A, B, C respectively. We take the normalization A0B0C0 = 4.

In the second case, ¯g(t) = (B0/B(t))g(t) converges to a sub-Riemannian geometry.

We will prove the following theorem.
