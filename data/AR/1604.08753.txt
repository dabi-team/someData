To optimize the adhesion of layers presenting strong barrier properties on low-density polyethylene (LDPE) surfaces, 
we investigated the influence of argon and argon–oxygen atmospheric  pressure post-discharges. This study was 
performed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, optical emission spectroscopy (OES) 
and  dynamic  water  contact  angle  (WCA)  measurements.  After  the  plasma  treatment,  a  slight  increase  in  the 
roughness  was  emphasized,  more  particularly  for  the  samples  treated  in  a  post-discharge  supplied  in  oxygen. 
Measurements of the surface roughness and of the oxygen surface concentration suggested the competition of two 
processes playing a role on the surface hydrophilicity and occurring during the post-discharge treatment: the etching 
and the activation of the surface. The etching rate was estimated to about 2.7 nm s−1 and 5.8 nm s−1 for Ar and Ar-
O2 post-discharges, respectively. The mechanisms underlying this etching were investigated through experiments, 
in which we discuss the influence of the O2 flow rate and the distance (gap) separating the plasma torch from the 
LDPE surface located downstream. O atoms and NO molecules (emitting in the UV range) detected by OES seem to 
be good candidates to explain the etching process. An ageing study is also presented to evidence the stability of the 
treated surfaces over 60 days. After 60 days of storage, we showed that whatever the O2 flow rate, the treated films 
registered  a  loss  of  their  hydrophilic  state  since  their  WCA  increased  towards  a  common  threshold  of  80°.  This 
‘hydrophobic recovery’ effect was mostly attributed to the reorientation of induced polar chemical groups into the 
bulk  of  the  material.  Indeed,  the  relative  concentrations  of  the  carbonyl  and  carboxyl  groups  at  the  surface 
decreased with the storage time and seemed to reach a plateau after 30 days. 

1. Introduction 

Polymers such as polyethylene present excellent physical and chemical bulk properties but exhibit poor surface adhesion features. The 

deposition of a subsequent layer onto a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) surface can be achieved for specific applications, for instance 

a layer acting as an oxygen barrier for food packaging. In order to improve the adhesion of a subsequent layer onto this polymer, a pre-

treatment of its surface is therefore usually performed. One of the most promising techniques is the plasma activation which—for 

instance—consists  of  exposing  the  sample  surface  to  the  post-discharge  of  a  radio  frequency  (RF)  plasma  torch.  These  plasma 

treatments can be carried out with different gases and vapours like O2, N2, NH3, H2O, CO2, air and noble gases [1–4]. Depending on the 

experimental  conditions,  it  is  considered  that  a  plasma  treatment  leads  to  one  of  the  four  following  effects:  cleaning  (removing  of 

organic contaminants), etching (removing of polymer material and degradation of polymer), cross-linking (formation of free radicals 

and  branching  of  macromolecules)  and  functionalization  (formation  of  new  chemical  functions)  [5–10].  Furthermore,  these  plasma 

treatments can be performed at atmospheric pressure, thus avoiding the costs of a vacuum installation and favouring their potential 

implementation into industrial applications. In particular, He or Ar post-discharges generated by a RF plasma torch demonstrated their 

efficiency in polymer treatment [8, 11] and in polymer plasma deposition [12]. Duluard et al [13] studied the optical emission of the 

species produced in an  Ar  post-discharge enriched  in water vapour. They explained the increase in ozone and in  nitrogen intensity 

(second  positive  system)  as  resulting  from  an  increase  of  the  torch-to-substrate  distance  (gap).  The  plasma  activation  could  be

accompanied by a slight etching process (without degradation of the underlying substrate) improving the surface roughness and tending 

to increase the hydrophilicity and furthermore the adhesion of a future layer. 

From the literature, it is commonly admitted that the hydrophilic character enhancement of a polyethylene surface is due to its oxidation 

which can be achieved by a plasma treatment to produce new oxygen-based functionalities such as hydroxyl or carboxylic groups on 

the surface [5, 6, 14]. However, this plasma-treated surface is subject to an ageing effect which occurs immediately after the plasma 

treatment and is considered as finished once the water contact angle (WCA) values reach a plateau. This plateau is usually located from 

5◦ to 25◦ higher than the values of freshly treated surfaces, depending on the nature of the film: polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide 

or LDPE [15–17]. This hydrophobic state recovery [18] can be  explained  by a reorientation of induced  polar chemical groups which 

occurs into the material bulk to minimize the interfacial free energy between the polymer surface and its environment [19]. Moreover, 

the majority of the free functions or radicals can react either with the oxygen from the ambient air or among themselves. Besides the 

storage conditions, the ageing of plasma-treated polymer surfaces is also influenced by many other parameters such as the nature of 

the working gas and the crystallinity of the treated material [20–22]. 

The present study is focused on the etching/functionalization processes and on the ageing behaviour of plasma-treated LDPE surfaces. 

For this purpose, an atmospheric-pressure argon plasma torch was used with or without oxygen added as reactive gas. In addition, the 

influence of the gap and of the oxygen flow rate is evaluated. 

2. Experimental details 

In this study, transparent LDPE films (2×2 cm2) provided by PackOplast-Belgium were used, with a thickness of 40μm and a density of 

0.93 g cm−3. The polymer was treated using an AtomfloTM-250D plasma source provided by SurfX Technologies LLC [12]. The plasma 

was  generated  between  an  RF  powered  upper  electrode  (27.12  MHz)  and  a  lower  grounded  electrode.  The  argon  flow  rate  was 

maintained at 30 L.min−1 for all experiments, whereas the oxygen flow rate (O2) was varied between 0 and 25 mL.min−1 (at fixed gap). 

The emissive region of the post-discharge can be assimilated to a plume presenting a length estimated to 1 mm. Due to possible thermal 

damaging effects, the distance between the LDPE surface and the plasma torch (gap) was tuned between 2 and 30 mm, so that the 

exposed surfaces were not interacting with the plume. For the ageing study, samples were kept in Petri dishes in ambient conditions 

(room temperature at 20°C with 72% of humidity). 

The dynamic WCA measurements were performed using a Krüss DSA 100 (Drop Shape Analyser) in an air-conditioned room and the 

working  liquid  was  milli-Q  water.  Advancing  (aWCA)  and  receding  (rWCA)  angles  were  measured  by  depositing  and  withdrawing  a 

droplet  of  5μl  on  the  surface.  In  this  paper,  each  value  of  dynamic  WCA  corresponds  to  the  average  measurements  of  five  drops, 

randomly deposited onto the sample surface. 

The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with a PHI 5600 photoelectron spectrometer, operating at 

300W with a Mg Kα, 1,2 x-ray source (1253.6 eV) and under a vacuum of 9×10−9 Torr. Pass energies of the survey spectra and high-

resolution spectra were fixed at 93.90 eV and 23.5 eV, respectively. The take-off angle of the photoelectrons was 45° with respect to 

the sample normal axis. The C1s core level at 285.0 eV was used to calibrate the binding energy scale. The surface elemental composition

was calculated after removal of a Shirley background by using the following sensitivity coefficients: SC = 1 and SO = 2.85. The peak fitting 

of the C1s components was carried out with the Casa XPS software. 

The  mass  losses  of  the  plasma-treated  LDPE  films  were  evaluated  by  employing  a  Sartorius  BA110S  Basic  series  analytical  balance, 

characterized by a 110 g capacity and 0.01 mg readability. 

The  surface  roughness  was  evaluated  on  images  obtained  from  the  atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM)  technique.  The  device  was  a 

Dimension 3100 AFM using a Nanoscope IIIa controller equipped with a phase imaging extender, from Digital Instruments operating in 

the tapping mode (TM-AFM). Standard silicon tips (Tap300Al, BudgetSensors) were used with a 42N.m−1 nominal spring constant and a 

300 kHz nominal resonance frequency. All images were recorded in air at room temperature with a scan speed of 1 Hz. Except a second-

order polynomial function background slope correction, no further filtering was performed. From these flattened corrected data, the 

root-mean-squared roughness (Rrms) and the maximum topographic height were determined on the flattened 5 × 5μm2 images. 

Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) was performed with a Shamrock 500i from ANDOR Technology equipped with a CCD camera (iDus 

420 series camera with 1024 × 255 pixels). A 1800 grooves.mm−1 grating blazed at 300 nm (linear dispersion of 1.06 nm.mm−1 at a 

wavelength of 575 nm) was used for optical emission spectra in the visible–near infrared range. The spectra were acquired with an 

exposure time fixed to 2 ms and a number of accumulations as high as 30. 

3. Results 

3.1. Influence of the gap 

3.1.1. Wetting/functionalization 

The variation of the aWCA as a function of the gap is shown in figure 1 in the case of a polyethylene film exposed during 30 s to Ar and 

Ar-O2 post-discharges powered at 60W. Whatever the nature of the post-discharge, the highest wettability was obtained for the samples 

treated with the smallest gap. In the case of a pure argon plasma treatment (figure 1(a)), the aWCA decreases from 94° (untreated 

surface) to 57°±3° for a gap of 10mm and can even reach a value of 43°± 2.5° for a gap of 2 mm. The LDPE films treated with an Ar-O2 

post-discharge (figure 1(b)) depicts the same behaviour with values as low as 41° for a gap of 2 mm. For both plasma treatments, one 

can emphasize that the LDPE surface becomes more hydrophilic for a gap lower than 15 mm. 

In order to verify whether the surface activation could be achieved by polar groups (i.e. incorporation of oxygen functions responsible 

for the increasing hydrophilicity) [6, 14, 23, 24], the atomic oxygen concentration was determined from the area estimated under the 

O1s peak from the wide XPS spectra. In figure 1(a) as in figure 1(b), a small amount of oxygen is detected on the films treated for gaps 

higher than 15mm while more oxygen is implanted on smaller gaps. Indeed, at 2 mm, the oxygen surface concentration reaches almost 

25.0% and 29.5% in Ar and Ar-O2 post-discharges, respectively. This small change in the oxygen surface concentration between these 

two treatments could be explained by the etching process occurring on the topmost surface layers. A correlation between the etching 

rate and the oxygen flow rate is suggested later in this paper.

post-discharge (t = 30 s, P = 60W, O2 = 15 

mL.min−1 (b)). 

3.1.2. Topography/etching 

In order to investigate topographical changes of the plasma-treated surfaces, AFM imaging was achieved in tapping mode and compared 

to mass losses measurements performed on the samples after exposure to the post-discharge. The Rrms values and the relative mass 

losses for Ar and Ar-O2 post-discharge treatments as a function of the gap are shown in figures 2(a) and (b), respectively. 

In  figure  2(a),  for  a  gap  ranging  between  2  and  30  mm,  a  decrease  in  the  Rrms  is  observed  from  42.5  to  1.8  nm,  this  last  value 

corresponding to the pristine state. For gaps lower than 15 mm, the high Rrms values suggest a significant etching of the surface induced 

by the plasma treatment. Figure 2(a) also indicates a mass loss close to 35 μg.cm−2 for a gap of 2mm while almost no material was 

removed for gaps higher than 15 mm. A similar behaviour can be observed in the case of an Ar-O2 plasma treatment where the mass 

loss turns around 49 μg.cm−2 for a gap of 2mm (figure 2(b)). The correlation between the surface roughness values and the mass loss 

measurements could indicate an enhancement of the surface etching induced by a decrease of the gap.

3.1.3. The plasma phase 

OES was carried out in order to determine the species from the plasma phase which could contribute to the surface modification. For a 

gap of 10 mm, no ion could be detected in the Ar or in the Ar-O2 post-discharge, but only singlet Ar, O, N, OH and NO species. The 

intensities of O (777.7 nm), Ar (772.9 nm), N2 (380.8 nm) and NO (274.2 nm) are plotted as a function of the gap in figures 3(a) and (b). 

We also reported in figure 4 the emission spectra of N2 (C–B, 0–2) and NO (B2 –X2) respectively detected at 380.8 nm and 274.2 nm. 

In figure 3(a) as in figure 3(b), the intensities of the Ar and O species decrease monotonically as a function of the gap, which is consistent 

with the assumption of their production within the discharge. The intensities of these emitted species are globally lower in the Ar post-

discharge than in the Ar-O2 post-discharge. The intensities of the N2 and NO bands increase between 2 and 10mm for the Ar and the Ar-

O2 post-discharges, but then continuously decrease beyond these two thresholds. Duluard et al—who worked on the same RF plasma 

torch setup—suggested that theN2 molecules diffusing into the post-discharge were either completely dissociated or flowed with the 

injected carrier gas [13]. As Duluard et al detected a very low intensity of the N2(C) species for a gap lower than 7 mm, the air diffusion 

was assumed to be weak in the range of 2–5 mm, due to the elevated argon flow rate (30 L.min−1).

species observed in the post-

discharge (a) versus the gap in

at 60W.

measured in the Ar-O2 flowing post-

discharge for Ar = 30 L.min−1, O2 = 15 

mL.min−1, P = 60W, gap = 5 mm. 

3.2. Influence of the reactive gas flow (O2) 

In this section, the hydrophilicity, the roughness and the etching mechanisms of the plasma-treated LDPE surfaces were studied as a 

function of the oxygen flow rate. The gap was fixed to 10mm since beyond this value the plasma–surface interactions were too weak, 

and below (lower than 5 mm), the treated films sustained significant degradations attributable to thermal effects. 

3.2.1. Wetting/functionalization 

Figure 5 reports the variations of the dynamic WCA but also the oxygen and nitrogen relative surface concentrations versus the oxygen 

flow rate, for post-discharge treatments with a gap fixed at 10 mm, an RF power of 60W and a treatment time set to 30 s. For an increase 

in the oxygen flow rate from 0 to 5 mL.min−1, the aWCA decreases while for higher flow rates, a plateau close to 47° is reached. In 

contrast, the receding WCA (rWCA) continuously decreases over the 0–25 mL.min−1 range. For comparison, the XPS spectrum of the 

untreated LDPE is only dominated by the C1s peak. The wide survey of the treated LDPE shows the presence of both C1s and O1s peaks, 

and to a lesser extent nitrogen N 1s. Besides, the increase in the O2 flow rate from 0 to 25 mL.min−1 demonstrates a higher incorporation 

of oxygen from 21% to 26% and a small increase in the nitrogen concentration from 0.5% (no oxygen) to 2.5% (25 mL.min−1 of oxygen). 

The surface of the films freshly treated by the Ar-O2 post-discharge tends to be saturated in oxygen for O2 > 15 mL.min−1.

3.2.2. Topography/etching 

Figure 6 illustrates AFM images  of (a) an untreated LDPE surface and (b), (c) several plasma treated  LDPE surfaces for 5, 15 and 25 

mL.min−1 in the O2 flow rate. The corresponding Rrms values of these pictures, but also of the pictures obtained at 10 and 20 mL.min−1 

of O2, are reported as a function of the oxygen flow rate in figure 7. Whatever the O2 flow rate, the Rrms values are always much higher 

than the Rrms of a native surface, which is only 1.8 ± 0.2 nm. In a pure Ar post-discharge, the Rrms is 5.8±0.3 nm and increases until 36 

nm for O2 = 25 mL.min−1. Furthermore, the mass loss of the plasma-treated surface reported in figure 7 follows a linear increase with 

the O2 flow rate. A close correlation can therefore be suggested between the roughness and the mass loss of the sample. 

Figure 8 shows typical mass losses of the sample after its exposure to the post-discharge as a function of the treatment time for several 

oxygen  flow  rates.  As  the  mass  loss  varies  linearly  with  the  plasma  exposure  time,  a  mean  etching  rate  (nm.s−1)  was  evaluated  by 

calculating the slope of each linear fit. Knowing the density of the LDPE (0.93 g.cm−3), the mass loss (expressed in μg.cm−2) could easily 

be converted to a thickness (nm). The etching rates are plotted versus the oxygen flow rate in figure 8(b). The mean etching rate is 

linearly increasing with the oxygen flow rate, with a maximum as high as 7.3 nm.s−1 reached for O2 = 25 mL.min−1.

3.3. Stability of the modified surfaces 

As the atmospheric plasma treatment considerably enhanced the amount of polar groups at the polymer surface, a dedicated study 

was achieved to investigate the evolution of the surface wettability over time. The plasma-treated films were subjected to the air ageing 

(72% RH, 20°C) to evaluate their hydrophobic recovery time, as shown in figure 10(a), where the aWCA are plotted as a function of the 

oxygen flowrate. Immediately after the post-discharge treatment (gap of 10mm and RF power of 60 W), the LDPE film freshly treated 

by an Ar post-discharge becomes less hydrophilic (55.7±1.7°) than a film treated by an Ar-O2 post-discharge (47.5 ± 2.8°). This difference 

between Ar and Ar-O2 post-discharge treatments vanishes with ageing time. In figure 10(b), whatever the oxygen flow rate, the ageing 

process can be regarded as completed after 30 days since the aWCA values reach a plateau close to 80°. Even after 60 days of ageing, 

the effect of the plasma treatment is still permanent since the treated LDPE surfaces remain more hydrophilic (about 80°) than the 

untreated surfaces (close to 94°). 

Figure 10. (a) aWCA measurements of plasma-treated films versus the ageing time, (b) atomic oxygen concentration for films treated by an Ar-O2 

post-discharge with O2 equal to 0, 15 and 25 mL.min−1. 

These aWCA measurements can be correlated with the chemical surface composition detected by XPS. Figure 10(b) shows the relative 

elemental concentration of atomic oxygen present on the LDPE surface as a function of the ageing time. Here again, the films treated 

by  the  post-discharge  with  the  highest  O2  flow  rate  reach  the  final  hydrophilic  state  faster.  Whatever  the  initial  amount  of  oxygen 

measured on the surface, they all reach a concentration close to 12% after 30 days. 

It is noticeable that the variation of the oxygen concentration is in an exponential decay: 

[O] = k.exp(−t/τ) + [O]0, 

where [O]0 is the offset corresponding to [O] when t tends to the infinity, k is the amplitude and τ is the decay constant (or time constant) 

in terms of the ageing time. The variation of the oxygen concentration can be fitted with a first-order linear time invariant. From the 

fitted curves (figure 10(b)), the constant time (τ) was evaluated to 10.17, 11.42 and 12.04 days for pure argon plasma, Ar-O2 plasma ( 

O2 = 15 mL.min−1) and Ar-O2 plasma (O2 = 25 mL.min−1), respectively. ‘[O]0’ (representing the plateau reached in figure 10(b)) presents 

the same value (12%) whatever the post-discharge treatment, since the LDPE-treated surface keeps the same oxygen concentration 

after  the  ageing  process,  whatever  the  plasmas  conditions.  The  correlation  between  the  XPS  results  and  the  aWCA  measurements 

demonstrate that the oxygen functionalities are mainly responsible for the hydrophilic state of the plasma-treated surfaces.

To evaluate the chemical composition modifications of the plasma-treated LDPE surfaces, figure 11 introduces two XPS survey spectra: 

(a) is for the untreated surface and (b) for the surface treated by an Ar post-discharge. High-resolution peak fitting on C1s peaks are also 

plotted in both cases to highlight the nature of the chemical bonds supported by the C atoms. Before the plasma treatment, the C1s 

peak contains three components corresponding to (i) the hydrocarbon bond (285.0 eV), (ii) the carbon oxide bond (286.5 eV) and (iii) 

the carbonyl bond (288.0 eV). After the plasma treatment, the C1s peak contains a fourth contribution, namely a carboxyl carbon bond 

(288.9 eV) [21].

The presence of nitrogen (<3%) on the plasma-treated surface may slightly influence the oxygenated contributions defined at 286.5 eV 

and 288.0 eV as these bond energies are also specific to (C–N, C=N, C≡N) and (N–CO–N, N–C–O, N–C=O) groups, respectively [25]. Since 

the energy difference between some nitrogen- and oxygen-related groups is too small to allow a mathematical separation within error 

bars, the identification of the functional carbons based on the binding energies of the N1s and O1s peaks is rather difficult. Besides, the 

N1s peak lies between 397 and 403 eV: an energy range where several carbon–nitrogen species such as amides, imides, nitriles can be 

found. The peak fitting of N1s cannot therefore accurately specify the nature of the nitrogen containing functionalities on the LDPE 

surface. According to table 1, the nitrogen surface concentration is vanishing with the ageing time for a post-discharge treatment of 30 

s and an O2 flow rate of 15 mL.min−1. The same day after the plasma exposure, the nitrogen content is 2.8% while it is lower than 0.5% 

10 days afterwards.

oxygenated functions decrease with the ageing time, to the benefit of the C–C and/or C–H bonds.

4. Discussion 

4.1. The plasma phase 

Surfaces treated by an atmospheric plasma torch sustain milder conditions than in a low-pressure plasma source since the lifetime of 

the reactive species is shorter at atmospheric pressure and also due to the UV radiation which is less emissive in a post-discharge. As a 

consequence, the species produced in the discharge lose their reactivity upon an increase in the gap and only the long-life species can 

diffuse and reach the polymer surface to participate in the incorporation of functional groups [15, 26, 27]. 

Several  mechanisms  are  usually  considered  to  explain  the  production  of  O  species,  even  if  all  cannot  apply  here.  At  atmospheric 

pressure, the argon metastable species are mostly produced within the discharge by collisions between electrons and argon atoms, 

according to reaction (1) in table 2. The argon metastable species from the discharge could be consumed by quenching with O2 or O 

species according to reactions (2) and (3) respectively, or by collision with two argon atoms to produce molecular argon (Ar2) according 

to reaction (4). The production of O atoms can be achieved either by the electronic dissociation of O2 or assisted by the argon metastable 

species as suggested in reaction (2). As no band of O2 excited molecules was detected, not even O2 metastable species between 750 

and 770 nm [40], a complete dissociation of O2 in O radicals can be assumed and reaction (5) seems a good candidate to explain the 

possible production of O3. The O (1D) oxygen species may de-excite towards their fundamental level (3P) through the collisional process 

(6). They cannot be involved in the destruction of O3 according to reaction (7) since no emission of O2 metastables was detected between 

750 and 770 nm. The radiative decay of N2 reported in reaction (8) is validated since the transition (B 3 → A 3 ) was evidenced by OES 

at 654 nm. Furthermore, the N2 molecules can recombine with O2 to produce NO molecules as suggested in reaction (9) and as observed 

experimentally in figure 3. No N atoms were detected by OES either because no N atom was produced or because some of them are 

produced  but  consumed  upon  a  reaction  presenting  a  very  elevated  rate  coefficient.  The  hypothetical  excess  in  N  atoms  could  be 

consumed by O2 to produce NO and O species (reaction (10)). This observation is consistent with the increase in intensity of NO and O 

atoms when the gap is increased.

Table 2. Partial list of the chemical reactions with their rate coefficients for the Ar-O2 flowing post-discharge. 

At atmospheric pressure, OH radicals are produced mainly (i) by electron-impact dissociation of H2O molecules or (ii) by electron-impact 

ionization of H2O followed by dissociation of H2O+ to produce OH. As these reactions require energetic electrons they probably do not 

occur within the post-discharge. The production of OH radicals is assumed to be performed between the electrodes. The injection of O2 

in  the  post-discharge  is  assumed  to  decrease  the  electron  density,  thus  limiting  the  production  of  OH  radicals  and  therefore  their 

emission intensity. For this reason, a decrease in the OH emission is observed in figure 9 as a function of the increasing O2 flow rate. 

In a non-thermal plasma, two types of active species can be distinguished: the ones which are chemically reactive (for example O∗ and 

N∗) and the others which are non-reactive but able to break chemical bonds (photons, electrons, non-reactive ions and non-reactive 

excited species) provided a sufficient energy [46, 47]. The comparison between the energy of the species produced within the post-

discharge (Ar, NO, O) and the bond dissociation energies (in the LDPE structure) reported in table 3, suggests that the O radicals, excited 

states of Ar atoms and N2

+ ions have enough energy to be responsible for the etching process occurring during the treatment. The Arm 

species could be sufficiently energetic but could not be detected in the post-discharge.

4.2. Competitive and synergetic surface processes: activation, etching and oxygen diffusion 

During the plasma exposure, two simultaneous competitive processes occurred: the etching (figure 8) and the activation (figure 5) of 

the surface. The diffusion of oxygen could also participate as an additional process during the plasma treatment [48] provided a prior 

surface saturation in oxygenated functional groups.

4.2.1. Etching process 

As expected, the LDPE surface becomes much rougher after Ar or Ar-O2 plasma treatments. The increase in the Rrms of the plasma-

treated films correlated with the mass loss measurements indicated a significant etching process of the films. Similar linear behaviours 

have already been observed in other polymers [11]. For instance, in the case of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sample treated by 

an atmospheric He-O2 plasma torch, Hubert et al correlated a variation Rrms of 45 nm with a mass loss variation m of −550 ppm [49]. 

The mass losses were greater if oxygen was mixed with the carrier gas. 

In our case, the mean etching rate, estimated between 2.7 and 7.3 nm.s−1, is much higher than those observed for other polymers. 

Indeed Inagaki et al [4] who treated PET surfaces with a density of 1.38 g.cm−3, found a lower etching rate (close to 1.15 nm s−1) that 

may be attributed to their experimental conditions: an RF low-pressure argon plasma (13.3 Pa). Moreover, the density of the treated 

polymer  was  higher  than  the  density  of  the  LDPE  studied  here.  For  the  sake  of  comparison,  table  4  reports  various  etching  rates 

corresponding to different plasma treatments. 

The various etching rates from table 4 seem to indicate that they do not strongly depend on the pressure since they all are on the order 

of few nm.s−1 for pressures ranging between 13 Pa and atmospheric pressure. The detected species with a high energy (such as OI: 10.74 

eV) can be responsible for a physical etching since the bond dissociation energies of C–H and C–C are 4.81 eV and 3.65 eV, respectively. 

The  roughness  formation  can  be  due  to  two  randomly  distributed  phases  with  different  etch  rates.  Two  etching  modes  could  be 

defined/examined as follows: (1) with anisotropic flux of species (sputtering) and (2) with isotropic flux of etchants (chemical etching), 

as explained in  the works of Zakka et al  [52]. The roughness in our  case  is the anisotropic  etching  mode. The roughness formation 

mechanism  could  rely  on  a  natural  self-organization  mechanism  occurring  during  the  erosion  of  surfaces,  based  on  the  interplay 

between roughening induced by energetic species etching and cross-linking due to surface reorganization [53]. It could also result from 

the existence of local crystalline micro-areas on the surface which require more energetic species from the post-discharge than the 

amorphous regions to be etched. This assumption has been supported by Hubert et al to explain the texturization of PTFE surfaces 

induced by O radicals produced from a He-O2 flowing post-discharge at atmospheric pressure [11]. 

In figure 5, the hysteresis resulting from the aWCA and the rWCA versus the oxygen flow rate is in agreement with a Wenzel state, 

where the water remains trapped in the asperities resulting from the etching process [54]. As reported in table 5, the hysteresis can be 

correlated with the surface roughness but also with surface composition heterogeneities (particularly when a polymer surface contains 

both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups) and surface rearrangements during the contact with water. As a result, two parallel synergetic 

phenomena occur on the surface: the incorporation of oxygen functional groups promoting its hydrophilic character and the etching 

process promoting its roughening. Bico et al studied the influence of the roughness on the surface hydrophilicity [55] and showed that 

a rougher hydrophilic surface would become more hydrophilic than a smooth surface.

4.2.2. Activation 

In  the  literature  [14,  17],  different  treatment  times—from  few  milliseconds  to  several  minutes—are  reported  for  polymer  surface 

modifications. At the  beginning  of the treatment, contaminants  from the polymer  surface can be removed,  which may also lead to 

improved wettability. With further treatment time, the insertion of oxygen/nitrogen atoms on active sites of the polymer surface can 

occur, leading to the formation of various functional groups, thus changing the surface wettability. For longer treatment times, excessive 

scissions may take place leading to a layer of low molecular weight fragments on the surface such as LMWOM (low molecular weight 

oxidized material) as discussed afterwards. 

In our case, the plasma activation resulted in the insertion of active species (oxygen containing species) from the radicals of the post-

discharge. This phenomenon was more pronounced on samples exposed to a post-discharge enriched in oxygen (oxygen flow rate >5 

mL.min−1)  since  greater  amounts  of  oxygen  radicals  were  generated.  The  O  and  OH  radicals  from  the  post-discharge  are  known  to 

abstract secondary hydrogen atoms from LDPE polymer chains, resulting in the formation of alkyl radicals, as indicated in reaction (11). 

These alkyl radicals can react with atomic oxygen or ozone and lead to the formation of alkoxyl radicals. As Duluard et al [13] showed, 

the increase of the ozone concentration by increasing the oxygen flow rate with the same RF plasma torch, reaction (11) could explain 

the increasing incorporation of oxygen functions onto the LDPE surface. 

Moreover, C-radical sites from LDPE could react with oxygen radicals from the ambient air and result in the formation of peroxy radicals 

(reaction (12)) and hydroperoxides (reaction (13)) [21]. During the plasma treatment, chains scissions occur while chains with radical 

tails  having  more  mobility  are  created.  The  breaking  of  some  polymer  chains  can  induce  surface  rearrangements  such  as  polymer 

crystallinity modifications [23–56]. Immediately after post-discharge exposure, radicals from the surface can react with the oxygen from 

the ambient atmosphere and enhance the surface activation [57]. 

4.3. Ageing study 

In figure 12, the relative proportion of the oxygenated functions decreases with the ageing time to the benefit of the C–C and/or C–H 

functions. This result correlated with the increase in the aWCA obtained during the ageing process (figure 10(a)) may be attributed to a 

reorientation of the induced polar groups into the bulk of the polymer, whatever the plasma treatment. The treated surface would 

reorganize itself immediately after the Ar or Ar–O2 plasma treatment, without—nevertheless—recovering its native hydrophilic state. 

Besides, as reported in table 1, the nitrogen species could be ejected from the surface after the treatment under the form of NOx gases, 

since no nitrogen was detected by XPS on the surfaces of the films aged more than 10 days. 

J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys., 2014, Vol. 47, Issue 6, 065203, http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0022-3727/47/6/065203

In figure 10(a), the sharp increase observed in aWCA in one day was similar with the sharp decay of atomic oxygen concentration from 

the XPS curve in figure 10(b). According to Gerenser et al, low molecular weight oxidized material (LMWOM) coming from chain scissions 

during the plasma treatment, could slowly diffuse into the bulk material upon the ageing time, thus contributing to decrease the amount 

of oxygen on the topmost layers of the surface film [58]. The formation of non-volatile oligomers (i.e. LMWOM) may dominate the 

etching process, depending on the polymer, the reactive gas and the discharge conditions. The ageing study of the treated surfaces 

reveals a well-known [20] and partial recovery of the native wettability state, resulting from the rearrangement of polar species and the 

migration of LMWOM after a few days. The post-discharge also removes LMWOM or converts them into high molecular weight oxidized 

material (HMWOM) through cross-linking reactions. As a result, the weakly bound layers formed by the LMWOM are removed [59, 60]. 

This recovery remained partial since even two months later, the highest aWCA turned around 80° instead of 94° (native LDPE). An inert 

gas discharge can induce a so-called CASING (cross-linking by activated species of inert gases) process, creating a cross-linked layer on 

the polymer surface [60]. On the one hand, the formation of this layer due to the plasma treatment can subsequently restrict the chain 

mobility and thus partially inhibit the recovery of the native wettability state. The polar groups, which are likely to reorient into the 

bulk, are confronted to a cross-linking of the top layer. In the case of the ultra-high modulus polyethylene (UHMPE), the wettability 

seemed to decrease linearly with the ageing time [61]. On the other hand, the formation of a rougher surface after the exposure to the 

post-discharge causes an increase in hydrophilicity (lower contact angle), in agreement with the Wenzel model. The roughness of surface 

area seems to be stable with ageing time and this stability always creates a lower contact angle than the untreated LDPE one. After 40 

days of storage, the UHMPE WCA was close to 90°, without nevertheless reaching any plateau that could indicate the end of the ageing 

process (contrarily to our case). The slow ageing rate (increase of aWCA with the storage time) obtained in this paper, can therefore be 

considered as a better result. What is more, the induced treatment is favourable to the good adherence [62, 63] between the plasma-

treated LDPE film and a subsequent layer to be deposited. 

5. Conclusion 

The correlation between the aWCA, XPS and AFM results showed a better functionalization and roughness in the case of an Ar-O2 post-

discharge than for a pure Ar post-discharge. The Ar-O2 post-discharge seems to create the same functional polar groups but at higher 

concentrations and to promote the surface roughness, hence a better wettability state. The reactive gas flowrate as well as the gap 

influenced the chemical composition of the LDPE surface, but also its morphology and its wettability. Etching rates (between 2.7 and 

7.3 nm.s−1) specific to the plasma treatment conditions were determined by correlating mass loss measurements (between 10 and 60 

μg.cm−2) with treatment times. The improvement of the hydrophilicity was greater for the smaller gaps (lower than 15 mm) where—

according to our OES results—the more energetic species were able to break bonds and either eject fragments from the surface or 

create surface radicals. The ageing study showed that the aWCA of the modified surfaces increased towards a common threshold of 83° 

after 30 days of storage, whatever the O2 flow rate, thus indicating a partial recovery of the native wettability state. The formation of 

LMWOM or of HMWOM through the CASING process could explain the fact that the surface was not stable over a period shorter than 

30 days. Furthermore, we showed with the ageing time, that the functionalization was partially vanishing while the surface roughness 

was preserved. As a consequence, the fact that the  native wettability  state was never totally  recovered could  be attributed to this 

persisting roughness but also to the presence of remaining polar groups reoriented into the bulk.
