ABSTRACT

Context. The binary system AR Sco contains an M star and the only known radio-pulsing white dwarf. The system
shows emission from radio to X-rays, likely dominated by synchrotron radiation. The mechanism that produces most of
this emission remains unclear. Two competing scenarios have been proposed: Collimated outﬂows, and direct interaction
between the magnetospheres of the white dwarf and the M star.
Aims. The two proposed scenarios can be tested via very long baseline interferometric radio observations.
Methods. We conducted a radio observation with the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) on 20 Oct 2016 at 8.5 GHz
to study the compactness of the radio emission. Simultaneous data with the Australian Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) were also recorded for a direct comparison of the obtained ﬂux densities.
Results. AR Sco shows radio emission compact on milliarcsecond angular scales ((cid:46) 0.02 AU, or 4 R(cid:12)). The emission
is orbitally modulated, with an average ﬂux density of ≈ 6.5 mJy. A comparison with the simultaneous ATCA data
shows that no ﬂux is resolved out on mas scales, implying that the radio emission is produced in this compact region.
Additionally, the obtained radio light curves on hour timescales are consistent with the optical light curve.
Conclusions. The radio emission in AR Sco is likely produced in the magnetosphere of the M star or the white dwarf,
and we see no evidence for a radio outﬂow or collimated jets signiﬁcantly contributing to the radio emission.

1. Introduction

Jet-like outﬂows are a ubiquitous feature of accreting sys-
tems from the supermassive black holes at the center of
galaxies to the stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars
in close binary star systems, and including young stars in
star forming regions. Accreting white dwarfs however seem
by and large to be exceptions to the rule. Despite being
common enough to be nearby and accessible to detailed
study, for the most part accreting white dwarfs show lit-
tle evidence for highly collimated outﬂows, although there
have been suggestions of directed outﬂows in some high-
accretion-rate systems (Brocksopp et al. 2004). Jets from
black holes and neutron stars are associated with radio
emission, and so the detection of radio emission has been
used as indirect evidence for jet outﬂows from some accret-
ing white dwarfs (Körding et al. 2008, 2011), however such
a direct connection has yet to be proven. In the vast major-
ity of cases, cataclysmic variable stars are not strong radio
sources. A survey of 121 magnetic systems using the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) detected only 19 of them,
all but one having a ﬂux density below 1 mJy (Barrett et al.
2017). A study of disk accreting systems in their high states
detected several, but with ﬂux densities < 0.1 mJy (Coppe-
jans et al. 2016). The one exception, the system AE Aqr,

which can exceed 10 mJy, is believed to be in an unusual
“propellering” state in which its rapidly spinning magnetic
white dwarf is ﬂinging mass transferred from its companion
out of the binary (Wynn et al. 1997), and it is thought that
this expelled gas is the source of its radio emission (Meintjes
et al. 2012).

Very recently the ﬁrst rival to AE Aqr in terms of its
persistent radio ﬂux was discovered (Marsh et al. 2016).
The system, AR Scorpii (AR Sco) is a close binary sys-
tem composed of an M star and a white dwarf with an
orbital period of 3.56 h. The system hosts the ﬁrst and
only radio pulsing white dwarf discovered so far. Its emis-
sion pulses periodically on a period of 1.97 min, thought
to reﬂect the spin period of the white dwarf (Marsh et al.
2016). AR Sco, which is located at a distance of 116±12 pc,
exhibits emission from radio to X-rays, with a broadband
spectral energy distribution (SED) characteristic of syn-
chrotron emission. The optical and radio emission are both
modulated by the 1.97 min spin period, and the optical
emission is also strongly modulated on the 3.56-h orbital
period. The radio ﬂux density of AR Sco, which was ob-
served to vary from 6 to 17 mJy at 9 GHz in an hour’s run
on the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA, Marsh
et al. 2016), is very similar to that of AE Aqr, which at a
similar frequency was observed to vary from 3 to 17 mJy
during two six-hour-long runs on the VLA (Mauche et al.
2012). AR Sco’s orbital modulation features a maximum

in optical ﬂux around 0.1 orbital cycles before inferior con-
junction of the white dwarf (when it is closest to Earth at
orbital phase φ = 0.5). Much of the emission appears to
originate in the magnetosphere of the M star on the side
facing the white dwarf (Marsh et al. 2016; Katz 2017). The
ATCA data presented in the discovery paper were too short
in duration to test whether AR Sco’s radio emission is also
aﬀected by the binary orbit. The observed emission (with a
luminosity (cid:104)L(cid:105) ≈ 1.7 × 1025 W) is predominantly from the
synchrotron component which is powered by the spin-down
luminosity of the white dwarf (Marsh et al. 2016). The X-
ray luminosity is only ∼ 4% of its optical luminosity, which
together with the lack of Doppler-broadened optical emis-
sion lines indicates that there is little or no accretion in the
system. In this respect it diﬀers signiﬁcantly from AE Aqr,
which shows erratic ﬂaring behavior in overall ﬂux and line
emission that is rooted in mass transfer and ejection.

The pulses in AR Sco are observed from radio to ultra-
violet wavelengths, showing a spin-down of P ˙P −1 ∼ 107 yr,
while the cooling time of the white dwarf is (cid:38) 109 yr (Marsh
et al. 2016; Beskrovnaya & Ikhsanov 2016). Strong optical
linear polarization (up to 40%) and small but signiﬁcant
circular polarization have been observed, both being mod-
ulated by the orbital and spin periods (Buckley et al. 2017).
The presence of this polarization suggests a global topology
for the magnetic ﬁeld in the emission region, and may be
indicative of a rapidly rotating white dwarf with a strong
magnetic ﬁeld, as seen in neutron star pulsars such as the
Crab.

Most of the emission appears to arise on or near the M
star, however it is not clear how the energy is transferred
from the white dwarf to the M star. Two possibilities have
been proposed so far (Marsh et al. 2016; Buckley et al. 2017;
Katz 2017): Collimated relativistic particle outﬂows, and
direct interaction between the white dwarf magnetosphere
and the M star. Some form of collimation or speciﬁcity is re-
quired because the observed synchrotron emission amounts
to ∼ 7% of the total spin down power, whereas the M star
only covers ∼ 2% of the sky as seen from the white dwarf,
ruling out isotropic “irradiation” as the transfer mechanism
(Marsh et al. 2016). This, along with the synchrotron spec-
trum, raises the question of whether the radio emission in
AR Sco comes from a relativistic jet, interesting given the
often-used association between radio emission and jet out-
ﬂows referred to earlier.

In this letter, we report on a very long baseline interfero-
metric radio observation with the Australian Long Baseline
Array (LBA) that allowed us to study the compactness of
the radio emission from AR Sco. We present the observa-
tions and the data reduction in Sect. 2. We quote the results
of these observations in Sect. 3 and discuss the properties of
the observed radio emission and the constraints that these
results place on the origin of the radio emission in Sect. 4.
Finally, we state our conclusions in Sect. 5.

2. Observations and data reduction

We observed AR Sco at 8.4 GHz on 20 October 2016 from
0:20 to 9:00 UTC with the LBA (project code V548A).
Seven stations participated during this observation: ATCA,
Ceduna, Hobart, Mopra, Parkes, Katherine, and Wark-
worth. The data were recorded with a total bandwidth of
32 MHz divided into two subbands of 32 channels each,

with full polarization. The ATCA also recorded simultane-
ous interferometric data with a larger bandwidth of 2 GHz
to study the emission on arcsecond angular scales. We used
3C 273 as a fringe ﬁnder, and J1625−2527 as the phase
calibrator (located 2.7◦ away from AR Sco and with a ﬂux
density of ∼ 1.2 Jy). A phase-referencing cycle of 5 min
was used, expending 3.5 min on AR Sco and 1.5 min on
J1625−2527.

The LBA data have been reduced in AIPS1 and Difmap
(Shepherd et al. 1994) following standard procedures.
A-priori amplitude calibration was performed using the
known gain curves and system temperature measurements
recorded on each station during the observation. For Wark-
worth we used the nominal System Equivalent Flux Density
(SEFD). Manual ﬂagging was ﬁrst performed to remove
bad data (those mainly aﬀected by Radio Frequency In-
terference). We then fringe-ﬁtted and bandpass calibrated
the data using 3C 273. We imaged and self-calibrated the
phase calibrator, J1625−2527, to improve the ﬁnal calibra-
tion of the data. Finally, the obtained solutions were trans-
ferred to AR Sco. Diﬀerent weighting schemes were used
during the imaging. The ﬁnal images were obtained by us-
ing a Briggs robust weighting of zero (Briggs 1995), which
provided the optimal balance between resolution and sen-
sitivity, and a natural weighting, which allowed us to self-
calibrate the data in phase due to the higher sensitivity.
This self-calibration improved the phase solutions, produc-
ing thus a more accurate image of the source.

We characterized the emission observed in the ﬁnal im-
ages following two diﬀerent approaches: by ﬁtting a Gaus-
sian component to the uv-data, which provides a more
reliable measurement of the source size, and by ﬁtting a
Gaussian component in the image plane. Since in very-long-
baseline interferometric (VLBI) observations we cannot use
primary ﬂux calibrators (they are resolved on mas scales),
our LBA ﬂux density measurements reported below may be
in error at the 10–20% level.

The ATCA data have been reduced in Miriad (Sault
et al. 1995) and CASA2 following standard procedures. The
amplitude calibration of all stations was set using 3C 273.
We then calibrated the data in phase using J1625−2527.
The solutions in amplitude and phase were then transferred
to AR Sco, which was ﬁnally imaged.

3. LBA and ATCA results

As can be seen in Fig. 1, AR Sco is detected in the LBA
data as a radio source compact on milliarcsecond angular
scales. Figure 1 (left) shows the image obtained with a nat-
ural weighting. AR Sco is detected at the position αJ2000 =
16h21m47.294570(5)s, δJ2000 = −22◦53(cid:48)11.24987(9)(cid:48)(cid:48) with a
ﬂux density, measured in the image plane, of 6.5 ± 0.7 mJy.
The rms noise level of the image is 0.4 mJy. A ﬁt in the
uv-data converges into a source with a ﬂux density of
≈ 7.3 mJy and a size of 1.2 mas (compatible with the syn-
thesized beam of 2.4×3.5 mas2, position angle, PA, of 39◦).
We note the presence of phase errors in the data that
can introduce artiﬁcial features in the source structure, a

well-known caveat of phase-referencing observations (e.g.,
see the large-scale anti-symmetric amplitudes in Fig. 1, left,
around the source). To improve the results we conducted
a phase self-calibration of the data using 30-min solution
intervals. A natural weighting provided a more sensitive
image with a point-like source of 6.8 ± 0.2 mJy (rms of
0.16 mJy). A Briggs robust weighting of zero provided a
map with a higher resolution (see Fig. 1, right) with a syn-
thesized beam of 1.8 × 2.9 mas2, PA = 40◦. No extended
emission is detected above the rms of 0.4 mJy. A ﬁt to the
uv-data converges to a point like source of ≈ 7.1 mJy and
a size of ∼ 0.17 mas (∼ 10% of the synthesized beam).
We note that the consistent solutions obtained across the
sub-bands after self-calibration, the compatible ﬂux densi-
ties obtained for AR Sco before and after self-calibration,
and the lack of any visible extended emission in the orig-
inal data provide further conﬁdence in the self-calibrated
results.

The ATCA data present a much larger synthesized beam
(14 × 13 arcsec2, PA = 83◦), showing compact radio emis-
sion with a ﬂux density of 6.2 ± 0.2 mJy, consistent with
that obtained from the LBA data on mas scales.

Almost 2.5 orbital cycles of AR Sco were covered in our
observation. This allows us to search for variability within
the observation while keeping reasonable uv-coverage in
both the LBA and the ATCA data sets. Figure 2 shows
the light curve of AR Sco as a function of the orbital phase
during the performed observation as obtained from the LBA
and ATCA data, using the ephemerides provided by Marsh
et al. (2016). We observe a signiﬁcant variability in the
ATCA data (> 6σ). The LBA data show the same trend
but with a signiﬁcance of 2.8σ due to the larger uncertain-
ties. The minimum of the radio emission takes place at an
orbital phase of ≈ 0.0, and is coincident with the minimum
of the optical emission (see Fig. 2 and Marsh et al. 2016).
AR Sco thus shows the same behavior along the orbital
phase on both arcsec and mas scales, and all ﬂux densities
agree within 2σ. The LBA ﬂux densities exhibit slightly but
consistently higher values (20–30%), which can be under-

stood by a systematic oﬀset applied between ATCA and
LBA calibrations. Indeed, the obtained ﬂuxes in the cali-
brator J1625−2525 exhibit a 30% deviation between both
datasets conﬁrming this.

4. Discussion

4.1. Astrometry of AR Sco

The position of AR Sco obtained from the LBA data shows
a statistical uncertainty of ∼ 0.01 mas. However, systematic
errors must be taken into account for further comparisons.
First, the uncertainty in the position of the phase calibra-
tor, J1625−2527, is 0.2 and 0.1 mas in right ascension and
declination, respectively (Beasley et al. 2002). Secondly, the
phase-referencing technique also introduces additional un-
certainties to the ﬁnal positions. Using the estimations pro-
vided by Pradel et al. (2006) in phase-referencing VLBI ob-

servations, we expect an uncertainty of ∼ 0.3 mas in our
image of AR Sco. As a conclusion, we would expect a total
uncertainty of ∼ 0.5 mas on the measured position.

The position of AR Sco reported in Gaia DR1 (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2016) is αJ2015.0 = 16h21m47.293745s ±
0.23 mas, δJ2015.0 = −22◦53(cid:48)11.157505(cid:48)(cid:48) ± 0.45 mas. This
position was obtained from measurements over the inter-
val 25 July 2014 and 16 September 2015 and is referenced
to J2015.0, although, as AR Sco is not bright enough to
appear in the Tycho catalog, it does not have a full ﬁve-
parameter astrometric solution in Gaia DR1. The uncer-
tainties in the listed position are based upon modeling with
a Bayesian prior on the proper motion and parallax (Micha-
lik et al. 2015). The fourth U.S. Naval Observatory CCD
astrograph catalog (UCAC4, Zacharias et al. 2013) provides
proper motion estimates of µα = 12.4 ± 3.0 mas yr−1, µδ =
−50.5 ± 2.4 mas yr−1 for AR Sco. Correcting the radio
position for parallax assuming a distance of 116 pc, we
ﬁnd that the LBA minus Gaia DR1 position diﬀerence is
∆α = −4 ± 5 mas, ∆δ = −3 ± 4 mas (without correct-
ing for parallax the values are ∆α = −10 and ∆δ = −1).
The uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainties in the
ground-based proper motion measurements and can be ex-
pected to decrease signiﬁcantly once a full ﬁve-parameter
solution becomes available with Gaia DR2. At present the
optical and radio positions match within their uncertain-
ties.

4.2. Compactness of the radio emission

AR Sco shows a compact radio emission on milliarcsec-
ond scales with no signatures of extended emission. The
model ﬁt to the self-calibrated data provides a source size
of 0.17 mas. Given the synthesized beam of the image
(1.8 × 2.9 mas2), this value is comparable to the max-
imum resolution reachable by an interferometer (Martí-
Vidal et al. 2012). We thus conclude that the radio emission
from AR Sco is unresolved on mas scales. This size implies
that the radio emitting region is (cid:46) 0.02 AU (or 4 R(cid:12), which
is ∼ 3 times the semimajor axis of the orbit). We thus infer
a brightness temperature of Tb (cid:38) 5×109 K, clearly implying
non-thermal emission.

AR Sco shows a compatible (at 2-σ level) ﬂux density of
∼ 6.5 mJy in both the LBA and the ATCA data, implying
that there is no signiﬁcant ﬂux lost on mas scales. This
supports the idea that most (if not all) the radio emission
arises from a compact region near the white dwarf or at the
surface of the M star (as suggested by Marsh et al. 2016;
Katz 2017).

4.3. Variability

AR Sco exhibits radio and optical light curves modulated
by both the orbital and spin period (see Marsh et al. 2016;
Stanway et al. 2017, in prep). The simultaneous LBA and
ATCA data show that the radio emission on arcsecond and
mas scales is synchronized in time on ∼ 20-min timescales
(see Fig. 2). This adds further support to the lack of signif-
icant outﬂows or collimated jets in the system. If they were
to exist we would expect those outﬂows to be detected in
the LBA data, or to be resolved out. In the latter case we
would expect a) lower emission on mas scales and b) a pos-
sible time delay between the two light curves (or no correla-

tion at all) given the dynamical timescales of the particles
producing the radio emission.

5. Conclusions

We observed the radio-pulsing white dwarf binary AR Sco
with the Australian Long Baseline Array and Australian
Telescope Compact Array, and found it to be unresolved
on milliarcsecond scales. If the energy transport between
the white dwarf and its companion M dwarf is via a jet,
then either that jet must not contribute signiﬁcantly to the
electromagnetic ﬂux from the system, or it must fade on
a scale of a few solar radii. Alternatively, there is no jet,
and the energy ﬂow is sustained through magnetic inter-
action, perhaps inductive in nature, with most dissipation
occurring close to the M dwarf. Our observations contain
evidence for variability of a factor of two in radio ﬂux on
the orbital cycle, with the time of minimum ﬂux matching
the phase of minimum optical ﬂux.
