ABSTRACT

Context. The origin of the quiet Sun magnetism is under debate. Investigating the solar cycle variation observationally
in more detail can give us clues about how to resolve the controversies.
Aims. We investigate the solar cycle variation of the most magnetically quiet regions and their surface gravity oscillation
(f -) mode integrated energy Ef .
Methods. We use 12 years of HMI data and apply a stringent selection criteria, based on spatial and temporal quietness,
to avoid any inﬂuence of active regions (ARs). We develop an automated high-throughput pipeline to go through all
available magnetogram data and to compute Ef for the selected quiet regions.
Results. We observe a clear solar cycle dependence of the magnetic ﬁeld strength in the most quiet regions containing
several supergranular cells. For patch sizes smaller than a supergranular cell, no signiﬁcant cycle dependence is detected.
The Ef at the supergranular scale is not constant over time. During the late ascending phase of Cycle 24 (SC24, 2011-
2012), it is roughly constant, but starts diminishing in 2013, as the maximum of SC24 is approached. This trend continues
until mid-2017, when hints of strengthening at higher southern latitudes are seen. Slow strengthening continues, stronger
at higher latitudes than at the equatorial regions, but Ef never returns back to the values seen in 2011-2012. Also, the
strengthening trend continues past the solar minimum, to the years when SC25 is already clearly ascending. Hence Ef
behavior is not in phase with the solar cycle.
Conclusions. The solar cycle dependence at the supergranular scale is indicative for the ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld being
replenished by tangling from the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld, and not solely due to the action of a ﬂuctuation dynamo
process in the surface regions. The absence of variation at smaller scales might be an eﬀect of the limited spatial
resolution and magnetic sensitivity of HMI. The anticorrelation of Ef with the solar cycle in gross terms is expected,
but the phase shift of several years indicates a connection to the large-scale poloidal magnetic ﬁeld component rather
than the toroidal one. Calibrating AR signals with the QS Ef does not reveal signiﬁcant enhancement of the f -mode
prior to AR emergence.

1. Introduction

Localized regions of intense bipolar magnetic structures,
called active regions (ARs), are seen on the solar surface.
Their numbers vary periodically in an 11-year cycle and
trace the butterﬂy diagram, which reveals a cyclic mag-
netic activity of the Sun in a latitude–time domain. Such
diagrams have proven to be useful and reveal some proper-
ties of the solar large-scale magnetic ﬁeld. The large-scale
magnetic ﬁeld reverses its polarity every second such cycle,
which constitutes the solar magnetic cycle of 22 years. The
origin of this global variability is not yet fully understood
(see, e.g., Charbonneau 2010).

In addition to the global solar magnetic ﬁeld, it is ob-
servationally known that there are ubiquitous small-scale
magnetic ﬂuctuations, the origin of which is equally debated
- they could arise through the action of a small-scale dy-
namo instability or tangling of the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld
due to turbulence driven by convection, but it is not self-
evident how the former mechanism could work in the solar

plasma, where the conditions are in general unfavourable
for it (see, e.g. Brandenburg & Subramanian 2005). These
magnetic ﬂuctuations are usually studied by investigating
the magnetically quiet regions on the solar surface (here-
after referred to as the quiet Sun, QS). Several observa-
tional studies of QS magnetism have been conducted, and
it has been argued that the QS magnetic ﬁeld is indepen-
dent of the solar cycle (see, e.g., Kleint et al. 2010; Buehler
et al. 2013; Faurobert & Ricort 2015; Jin & Wang 2015a,b).
On the other hand, some other studies have proposed that
some dependence should exist (e.g. Lites et al. 2014; Meu-
nier 2018; Faurobert & Ricort 2021). Taken the theoretical
and observational controversies, further studies of QS mag-
netism are required, and long-term investigations are now
enabled by instruments like Helioseismic and Magnetic Im-
ager (HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) on board
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012)
This instrument provides high sensitivity, high spatial res-
olution, long-term stability, and constant conditions. Cur-

rently, the data covers 12 years of observations, enabling
solar-cycle-scale studies.

Another motivation to study the QS comes from re-
cent observational investigations (Singh et al. 2016; Waidele
et al. 2022) that have reported strengthening of solar sur-
face or the fundamental f -mode about one to two days be-
fore the formation of ARs using diﬀerent kinds of local he-
lioseismic techniques. Accompanied with numerical simula-
tions that have given similar indications Singh et al. (2014,
2015, 2020), this seems as a very promising avenue of study-
ing the origin of solar sub-surface magnetism and the mech-
anism of active region formation. The observational stud-
ies, however, suﬀer from a lack of proper calibration method
against the QS. Singh et al. (2016), for example, rely on QS
regions on the opposite hemisphere to compare with the AR
f -mode. This method requires that a quiet patch exists on
the other hemisphere, and hence limits the number of ARs
that can be included in the hindcasting procedure. It is also
prone to be aﬀected by the probable ﬂuctuations in the QS
f -mode level. Although the results look promising, proper
calibration with statistically sound QS level, not just a com-
parison of a random QS patch on the other hemisphere, is
necessary to prove the robustness of these ﬁndings. Also,
such a calibration procedure is necessary for increasing the
sample size. Building such a QS calibration data product
is one of the main aims of this study: we carefully identify
the quietest regions on the solar surface based on the level
of magnetic activity observed in line-of-sight (LOS) magne-
tograms that are readily available from HMI, and compute
the f -mode energy at the central meridian as function of
latitude and time with suitable averaging. Building such a
data product for the f -mode, requiring us to identify the
most inactive regions on the solar surface, allows us to ex-
tract statistics of the QS magnetism as well, which is the
second main aim of this study.

The paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 we describe
the data, the necessary steps to clean it, and the automated
pipeline we built for harvesting the data and compiling the
end products, namely the QS magnetism data products,
and the QS and AR f -mode data. In Sect. 3 we discuss
our ﬁndings for the QS magnetism, f -mode, and the lastly
present some AR data with the QS calibration applied.

2. Observations

Our analysis is based on data from HMI@SDO. We use
two standard data products: (i) full-disk line-of-sight (LOS)
magnetograms, computed every 720 s by combining ﬁlter-
grams obtained over a time interval of 1260 s (hmi.M_720s),
and (ii) full-disk LOS dopplergrams, computed every 45 s
from six positions across the nominal 6173.3 Å spectral line
(hmi.V_45s). We processed the two data sets in a semi-
automatic pipeline (see Fig. 2), optimized for obtaining re-
liable information about the magnetic ﬁeld in the QS re-
gions and for a robust computation of the f -mode power
from the dopplergrams. The left tree in Fig. 2 describes the
pipeline used for the magnetograms, the right tree for the
dopplergrams. In the following we use the following nota-
tion and deﬁnitions. We denote the solar latitude with λ,
longitude with ϕ, both in the Stonyhurst coordinate system
(Thompson 2006), and time with t.

Fig. 1. Data pipeline. The leftmost tree illustrates the pipeline
to collect the magnetograms in the most quiet patches, while the
rightmost one the pipeline to track data from the quiet patches
from the HMI database, and compute the f -mode energy. The
central path of AR processing is otherwise equivalent to the QS
pipeline, but there AR coordinates are sent for tracking in the
MPS (in Germany) cluster environment, and an additional step,
namely QS calibration, is performed in the end. Rectangular
boxes represent analysis functions, and ellipsoids the derived
data products. The rectangles with yellow frames stand for the
corrective functions applied to the data.

2.1. Magnetograms

The ﬁrst data product, full-disk line-of-sight (LOS) mag-
netograms, provides a direct measurement of the variabil-
ity of the QS magnetism during a solar cycle. To enhance
the signal-to-noise ratio in the LOS magnetograms we per-
formed a newly developed algorithm for spatial and tem-
poral averaging: The full-disk HMI magnetograms starting
from 27-Apr-2010 and ending at 04-May-2022 were down-

Korpi-Lagg et al.: Quiet-Sun Solar Variability

loaded from the Joint Science Operation Center (JSOC)
hosted at Stanford University (http://jsoc.stanford.edu)
to a temporary storage (see Fig. 2, ’Mahti storage’) and
tracked at full spatial resolution for 8 hours to compensate
for the solar rotation (’Full disk tracking’). We neglected
diﬀerential rotation due to the short tracking time. The
step between tracked sequences was 4 hours, so that a total
of 6 tracked sequences were gathered per one day, resulting
in more than 25765 tracked sequences (as of 04-May-2022).
From each tracked sequence, we extracted two data
products by dividing the visible solar disk between latitudes
and longitudes from −80◦ to +80◦ into (i) 64 × 64 overlap-
ping patches of 15◦ (in solar latitude and longitude) and (ii)
180 × 180 patches of 1◦. Every of these patches therefore
contains a space-time cube of LOS magnetograms at full
spatial resolution at a 12-minute cadence, from which we
compute the root-mean-square (rms) of the magnetic ﬁeld
strength, averaged over the full ﬁeld-of-view of the tracked
cube and over the full 8 hour period (Brms=(cid:112)(cid:104)B2(cid:105)LOS).
The 15◦ patches (i) are large enough to cover several super-
granulation cells containing network and internetwork ﬁelds
(Rieutord & Rincon 2010) with a typical size of 30–35 Mm
(we refer to them as Nw cubes), and the 1◦ patches (ii) are
small enough that some of them lie completely in the in-
ternetwork (INw cubes). The statistics for each patch were
stored as data products (see also Fig. 2) including the infor-
mation about latitudinal and longitudinal position as well
as the Carrington longitude for network and internetwork.
We refer to these maps as the Nw and the INw statistical
maps.

2.2. Quiet region selection
From the statistics computed from the cubes, Brms turned
out to be the best tracer for determining the magnetic ac-
tivity level. It could clearly distinguish between 15◦ patches
containing active regions, plage, enhanced network and
quiet network. Also, it depicted very well the low-ﬁeld in-
ternetwork regions.

The analysis of the solar-cycle variation of the QS mag-
netism required a careful selection of the most quiet regions,
deﬁned as being free of enhanced solar activity. We there-
fore searched for the minimum value of Brms in both, the
Nw and the INw statistical maps, on a latitudinal grid with
a 10◦ spacing fulﬁlling the following additional criteria:

(i) the most quiet pixel must be within ±10◦ around the

central meridian,

(ii) this pixel must belong to the 10% most quiet pixels

of the month,

(iii) this pixel must be the most quiet pixel within a 4-day

interval.

Criterion (i) was chosen to get the strongest magnetic
ﬁeld signal along the central meridian. Criterion (ii) guar-
antees an equal distribution of quiet pixels over the 12-year
period of available HMI measurements, and criterion (iii)
ensures that the quiet pixels for the 1-month period do not
originate from the same supergranular structure, since the
dynamical evolution time of the supergranulation lies be-
tween 24 and 48 h (Rieutord & Rincon 2010). As a result
of applying these criteria we obtained two time series of
the Brms for the most quiet patches in the network and
the internetwork regions. Note that this selection also ef-

ﬁciently removes the 24 h modulation present in the HMI
magnetograms.

2.3. Correction for HMI sensitivity change

The temporal evolution of INw Brms value revealed clearly
a change in the HMI observing mode, performed on 13-
Apr-2016. On this day, HMI switched to a more eﬃcient
observing mode (see Hoeksema et al. 2018, 2014; Couvidat
et al. 2016). By combining both HMI cameras to determine
the vector-ﬁeld observables the cadence for full-disk magne-
tograms could be reduced from 135 s (observational mode
MOD-C) to 90 s (MOD-L). This reduced the noise level for
Stokes V measurements by 17%, resulting in a decrease of
the noise level in the LOS magnetograms by 5%.

For the long-term study presented in this paper, we need
to correct for this sensitivity change. A very accurate cor-
rection method can be derived from the INw time series:
since it contains only the most quiet pixels over a certain
latitude region and time, the sensitivity change results in
a step function. The value of the step was determined by
ﬁtting a polynomial to the Brms values determined from
the INw time series plus a Heaviside step function, cen-
tered at the date of the mode change. We used the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC, Stoica & Selen 2004) to deter-
mine the degree of the polynomial, which lies between 1
and 6 for the various latitudes. We want to note that the
retrieved amplitude of the Heaviside step function is only
weakly dependent on the degree of the polynomial. This ﬁt-
ting is exempliﬁed in Fig. 2 for the solar latitude 0◦, where
the minimum value for the BIC was reached for a ﬁt with
a polynomial of degree 3. The so-determined amplitude of
the Heaviside step function is added to the Brms data points
after 13-Apr-2016 for all data presented in this paper.

2.4. Dopplergrams

The second HMI data product used in this paper are the
LOS velocity maps. The goal is to compute the energy con-
tained in the surface gravity mode, the so-called f -mode,
and investigate whether variability during the solar cycle
is present. Such variations could be caused by the pres-
ence of non-emerging sub-surface magnetic ﬁelds, as the
f -mode is known to be strongly aﬀected by the presence of
magnetic ﬁelds (see, e.g., Cally et al. 1994; Cally & Bog-
dan 1997; Singh et al. 2016). It is also very important to
study this question in more detail, for establishing a reli-
able calibration method for a measurement of the claimed
f -mode enhancement prior to AR emergence Singh et al.
(2016); Waidele et al. (2022).

The dopplergram data is hosted in the German Data
Center for SDO (GDC-SDO) on a server at the Max Planck
Institute for Solar System Research (MPS Göttingen, Ger-
many) whereas the analysis is executed in the CSC su-
percomputing environment (Finland). We have utilized a
function-as-a-service client based on funcX (Chard et al.
2020) for accessing the required data in the database server.
We have developed functions based on funcX API and de-
ployed the functions in the MPS environment. These func-
tions leverage the mtrack1 command to prepare the dopp-
lergram cubes within the GDC-SDO environment and sub-
sequently transfer them to the CSC environment. The co-
ordinates of the selected QS regions were sent to the funcX
service, which invokes suitable functions to automate the
data retrieval and movement. The data processing pipeline
used Astropy2, a community-developed core Python pack-
age for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration et al. 2013,
2018) and version 3.1.6 of the SunPy3 open source software
package (The SunPy Community et al. 2020).

2.5. Computation of the f -mode energy

Subsequent processing involved calculating the three-
dimensional power spectra for each dopplergram cube and
integrating in (kx, ky)-plane, for each angular frequency ω,
(cid:113)
over all wavenumbers, k =
, to obtain a collapsed
x + k2

y
power spectrum, P (ω, k). An illustrative case for a fre-
quency value at which f -mode is strong, is shown in Fig. 3,
upper panel. Such a procedure signiﬁcantly reduced the
noise level leading to smooth one-dimensional k−ω spectra,
an example being shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3; in this
kind of a plot, the f -mode is the rightmost peak at the high-
est k values. The adopted procedure is justiﬁed for the QS
spectra, as the ring diagrams are radially symmetrical w.r.t.
ω axis. To obtain the total energy contained in the f -mode,
Ef , we performed another integration over the separated f -
mode signal. In contrast to earlier studies (Singh et al. 2016;
Waidele et al. 2022), we did not perform ﬁtting to the f -
mode for its extraction. Instead, we only determined the
background signal, and subtracted this contribution. The
background determination used the fact that the position
of the f -mode peak for low values for ω (between 3 and 6
rad s−1) lies outside the k range used for the computation
of the f -mode power. Since the background level does not

change signiﬁcantly with ω, the average spectrum over this
ω range provided a good estimate for the background sig-
nal. Then, an integration range in k space was selected for
each constant ω in a following way: ﬁrst the maximum of
f -mode kmax and the minimum between f -mode and ﬁrst
p-mode kstart were detected; kstart was chosen as the start
of integration range and the end of the integration range
kend was set as kend = kmax + 2(kmax − kstart); kend chosen
in such a way guarantees that the integration range is suf-
ﬁciently wide to cover signiﬁcant part of the f -mode signal
in k-space. Integration range in ω space was chosen between
values starting from 14.45 and ending at 29.03, where the
signiﬁcant part of the f -mode power resides. As the end
result, we have computed the f -mode energy

After completing the described steps in the CSC super-
computing environment, we have collected a total of 22680
f -mode energies for patches close to central meridian over
all latitudes covering most of SC24 and the ascending phase
of SC25.

Orbital correction of the f -mode energy
Since the f -mode energy is computed from the LOS dopp-
lergrams, its value depends strongly on the viewing geom-
etry. This dependence, roughly following the cosine of the
solar latitude for data taken at the central meridian, is ad-
ditionally modulated by the orbital motion of the Earth
around the Sun, which changes the viewing angle at any
given solar latitude by ≈ ±7◦ during one year. We compen-
sated for this periodic variation by ﬁtting the parameters
(x0(λ), ..., x3(λ)) of the following function to all observa-
tions of a given latitude λ:

Acorr(λ) = x0(λ)(2((1 + cos(Φ + x1(λ)))/2)x3(λ) − 1)

+ x2(λ),

(2)

with Φ being the phase angle of the Earth deﬁned as the
cotangens computed from the x, y barycentric position of
the Earth. This correction Acorr(λ) is then subtracted
from the computed Ef values, which eﬃciently removes any
yearly variation.

3. Results
After applying the selection criteria described in Sec. 2.2
and the subsequent correction for the HMI’s sensitivity
change (Sec. 2.3) we obtain the dependency of the Brms
values of the most quiet region at the central longitude as a
function of heliographic latitude and time. Fig. 5 presents
the Brms values from May 2010 until May 2022 for the
Stonyhurst latitude and longitude (λ, ϕ) = (0, 0)◦. The in-
dividual data points (red dots) are computed over an area of
15◦ in latitude and longitude and over a time of 8 hours. At
disk center, this corresponds to an area of ≈ 180×180 Mm2,
and therefore contains 30–40 supergranular cells. The Brms
value therefore contains network and internetwork ﬁelds.
Typical magnetograms at disk center at solar minimum
(July 2010) and maximum (Nov 2014) are presented in
Fig. 4. There is no obvious diﬀerence between the two maps:

Korpi-Lagg et al.: Quiet-Sun Solar Variability

The average Brms value in the internetwork is in ≈ 6 G.
Using the area of one HMI pixel this corresponds to a mag-
netic ﬂux of 3 × 1016 Mx. This value is certainly aﬀected
by the sensitivity of the HMI instrument, and is reduced
to (cid:46) 5 G after the HMI sensitivity change described in
Sect. 2.3.

3.1. Quiet Sun f -mode butterﬂy diagram
To investigate whether the f -mode energy has any sig-
niﬁcant solar cycle dependence, we construct butterﬂy-
diagram-like plots by computing and removing the tempo-
ral mean, and plotting the so-obtained data in a binned
latitude-time diagram. We compute the temporal mean
over the whole time series as

Ef (λ) = 1/nt

(cid:88)

t

Ef (λ, t),

(3)

where nt is the total number of time points at a certain
λ, and denote it with an overbar. Next, we compute the
variation of the f -mode energy around this level, deﬁned
as

E(cid:48)

f (λ, t) = Ef (λ, t) − Ef (λ),

(4)

and plot this quantity for the central meridian as function of
latitude and time as in Figure 7, in patches with a 3-month
binning in time and roughly 6 degrees in latitude.

To estimate the overall variability level of the QS, and
compare it to the cycle variation level deﬁned above, we
will use the standard deviation of the data in a patch. We
take Nt bins in time, Nλ in latitude, and denote the number
of Ef measurements contained in such a patch by NP . We
compute the average f -mode energy in a patch as

(cid:104)Ef (cid:105) = 1/NP

Ef (λ, t).

(cid:88)

NP

(5)

Then we can straightforwardly calculate the standard de-
viation as

σ =

(cid:116)

NP

(cid:88)

patch

(Ef (λ, t) − (cid:104)Ef (cid:105))2.

(6)

From this we form the average error at each latitude by tak-
ing an average over time and denote it as σ. This quantity
is plotted as the error bar in the right panel of Fig. 7. By in-
specting the level of variability around the temporal mean
and the overall variability of the QS, we must conclude that
these signals are of the same order of magnitude. In this re-
spect, the solar cycle dependent signal is very weak, but if
we compare that to the noise level in the data, both the
QS variability level and cycle-dependent signal exceed the
noise level by an order of magnitude, hence this is not an
issue concerned with the instrument sensitivity.

What could be the cause of the strong QS variability
level is most likely related to the strongly varying sub-
surface magnetic ﬁelds that aﬀect the f -mode, invisible in
the surface Brms which was used as the selection criterion
for really quiet patches. This is illustrated in Fig. 9, where
we show the measured f -mode energy versus the Brms in the
patches. The f -mode energy is not correlated with the Brms
seen at the surface, and strong, nearly constant, variabil-
ity is seen at diﬀerent epochs of the solar cycle. This poses

both show similar minimum and maximum ﬁeld strengths,
and the visible impression of the supergranular cells with
the strong ﬁeld patches of both polarities surrounding the
internetwork regions is indistinguishable.

Fig. 5 clearly indicates the solar cycle dependence of the
QS magnetic ﬁelds, consisting of network and internetwork.
The Brms values peak in the second half of 2014, around half
a year later compared to the declared maximum of solar
cycle #24 (April 2014, source: WDC-SILSO, Royal Obser-
vatory of Belgium, Brussels). The variation is statistically
signiﬁcant, as indicated by the the mode and the 97% per-
centiles, computed by ﬁtting a log-normal distribution over
a 1-year sliding window.

A similar plot is presented in Fig. 6, but now the Brms
value was computed only for a 1◦ window in latitude and
longitude, corresponding to an area of only 12 × 12 Mm2
at disk center. The quiet-region selection criteria (Sec. 2.2)
guarantees, that this patch lies fully within the internet-
work, and is not ‘contaminated’ by network ﬁelds. Clearly,
there is no dependence of Brms with solar cycle detectable.
The slight increase over the 12-year period might be an ef-
fect of the aging of the HMI instrument and the resulting
decrease in the sensitivity for magnetic ﬁeld measurements.

early 2010; this cycle ended by around 2020 (see also the
lower panel of Figure 8, showing the sunspot number of
SC24 and SC25 up to the writing of this manuscript).
Broadly, we ﬁnd an anti-correlation of the f -mode energy
with the activity cycle of the Sun — during the so-
lar minimum and early rising phase (∼ 2010 − 12), the
f -mode energies are larger, and around cycle maximum
to the declining phase, the f -mode energy is suppressed.
This correlation is strongest near the solar equator, within
about ±20◦ in latitude, and it decreases with higher lati-

high as the values observed during the ascending phase of
SC24 (2011-2012).

In Figure 8 we present cuts through the butterﬂy dia-
gram at three diﬀerent latitudes, equator, and ±29◦, and
sinusoidal ﬁts to the data points. The variability is the
strongest at the equator, but also contains the largest scat-
ter. The minimum f -mode energy is obtained there around
the beginning of the year 2018. There, the diﬀerence in
magnitude during SC24 and 25 is the largest. Southern
higher latitudes show very weak variation in contrast to
the equator, while the Northern one with an intermediate
magnitude. The shift w.r.t. the solar cycle is somewhat lat-
itude dependent. At the higher northern latitude, the f -
mode minimum occurs roughly a year earlier than at the
equator. The shift in the f -mode mode phase w.r.t. the
sunspot cycle is of the order of three to four years, hence
it is more in phase with the poloidal phase of the magnetic
ﬁeld than the toroidal one.

3.2. AR f -mode with QS calibration

In this section we compare the f -mode time evolution be-
fore and after the emergence of two ARs (11130 in Figure 10
and 11105 in Figure 11), that were reported to show an en-
hancement both in Singh et al. (2016) and Waidele et al.
(2022) w.r.t. a QS control patch in the opposite hemisphere
several days before their emergence. The main diﬀerence in
our analysis is that the f -mode energy is now normalized to
the actually measured average QS level around the speciﬁc
time and latitude. To minimize the QS ﬂuctuations, Gaus-
sian smoothing to the QS Ef is applied, but the smoothing
kernel width used is kept at 5◦ in longitudinal and latitu-
dinal direction so that the ﬁt to the data can be considered
accurate. f -mode energy of 1 is hence equivalent to that
of the QS, and values stronger/weaker indicate enhance-
ment/quenching of the f -mode w.r.t. QS. Another diﬀer-
ence is that we use the full ring diagram when computing
the f -mode energy, while the other papers used only kx = 0
cuts. We have, however, performed analysis with kx = 0 and
ky = 0 cuts, and see no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the
two, nor w.r.t. the full ring data, except for the increased

tudes. Interestingly, we observe a temporal shift in the f -
mode butterﬂy diagram with respect to the solar cycle, such
that the minimum of the f -mode occurs later, i.e., in the
declining phase of SC24, roughly around the end of the year
2016.

During mid-2017, we see weak strengthening of the
f -mode strength to commence, ﬁrst occurring at higher
Southern latitudes. During the minimum (2018-2019) be-
tween the SC24 and 25, the strengthening appears stronger
in the higher latitudes. It also continues after the minimum,
when SC25 has already started its ascending phase. What
is also noteworthy is that the f -mode energy never rises as

noise level in Ef derived from single cuts. As the measure-
ment is done exactly in the same manner for the QS and
ARs, we anyway anticipate that this diﬀerence should not
inﬂuence the results signiﬁcantly. Also, as more integration
is performed, the less noisy is the signal, hence improving
the data quality.

The results from our AR analysis are shown with green
symbols and lines in Figure 10 and Figure 11:
in the
top panel, each orange point shows the normalized f -
mode energy, ˜Ef , with four-hour cadence, smoothed with
a 24-hour boxcar to remove a daily ﬂuctuation otherwise
prominently present in the HMI data. The shaded areas
show the QS variance, E(cid:48)
, determined from the standard
f
deviation of the variation presented in Fig. 9, is roughly
constant (around 4–5 percent) at all latitudes and longi-
tudes. When it is used as normalization of the f -mode, then
the uncertainty at large longitudes becomes very high, as is
indicated by the rapidly fanning shaded areas toward the
limbs. The Brms measured simultaneously at the surface is
shown in the lowest panels of the ﬁgures with black sym-
bols.

In the middle panels of Figure 10 and Figure 11, we com-
pare the diﬀerent calibration curve candidates. The calibra-
tion curve used by Singh et al. (2016), based on more sim-
ple cosinus dependence of the form cos α [q + (1 − q) cos α]
with q = 0.5 and cos α = cos λ cos ϕ, is shown with blue
symbols and lines in the aforementioned panels. As this
speciﬁc curve does not ﬁt the QS data very well, we also
performed a ﬁt and determined the optimal value of q, that
turns out to be −0.045; this curve and calibration with it
are plotted with orange symbols and lines in the top and
middle panel of the ﬁgures. The diﬀerences between these
calibration curves are illustrated in the middle panels: The
Singh et al. (2016) calibration curve does not ﬁt the data,
overplotted with gray dots, well at larger longitudes. There,
it is decreasing less strongly than the data. Near the disk
center the amplitude is too low to present the data well.
The new cosinus ﬁt and the Gaussian convolution applied
to the QS data represent it better, with the consequence
that the calibration curves decrease more steeply toward
the limbs. The ﬁtted cosinus curve has somewhat larger
amplitude than the Gaussian convolution. This has the ef-
fect that the ˜Ef calibrated with the cosinus ﬁt tends to
be always below the QS level. The Gaussian convolution
calibration results at ˜Ef values maximally at the QS level
before the AR emergence.

As can be seen from Figure 10 and Figure 11 top pan-
els, applying the new QS calibration curve ﬂattens the sig-
nal proﬁle in comparison to the earlier q = 0.5 calibra-
tion used. For both of the selected ARs, the f -mode energy
close to the limb is below the QS level to start oﬀ with,
which could indicate that both of these active regions occur
in an environment already aﬀected by a sub-surface mag-
netic ﬁeld. Applying the earlier calibration curve, a clear
enhancement above the QS level is visible for AR11130,
while for AR11105 the proﬁle is similar, but the enhance-
ment amplitude remains within the level of QS variability
(shaded area). The new calibration shows a more modest
enhancement, reaching its peak value at similar times as
with the earlier calibration for AR11130, while somewhat
earlier for AR11105, but its amplitude is not exceeding QS
level signiﬁcantly. Unfortunately, the possible enhancement
of f -mode energy of the selected ARs occurs so close to the

limb that it is not completely certain whether it is an arte-
fact of the rather uncertain limb calibration data, or a true
eﬀect. Obviously, a larger sample size should be studied,
including also ARs that emerge closer to the west limb to
completely prove/refute this scenario.

4. Discussion and conclusions

The ﬁrst part of the paper presented an analysis of QS mag-
netism, where the main ﬁndings were the solar cycle inde-
pendence of the internetwork magnetic ﬂuctuations, studied
by using 1◦ patches, while network and internetwork ﬁelds,
studied by using 15◦ patches, were found to show a statis-
tically signiﬁcant solar cycle dependence. The maximum of
the magnetic ﬂuctuations at the disk center was observed
to exhibit a phase shift of roughly half a year w.r.t. to the
sunspot-number-deﬁned cycle. We interpret these ﬁndings
as follows. The independence of the internetwork magnetic
ﬁelds is either reﬂecting the fact that these ﬁelds, clearly
on smaller scales than the supergranular cells, are generated
by the ﬂuctuation (or small-scale) dynamo alone, or then
the sensitivity of the HMI instrument prevents one to see
any variation. The solar cycle dependence of the network
and internetwork ﬁelds reﬂects the fact that two separate
processes are responsible for generating these ﬁelds. Turbu-
lence is tangling the solar-cycle dependent large-scale sub-
surface ﬁeld resulting in magnetic ﬂuctuations that have
the same dependence, and these are then expelled to the
edges of the supergranular cells. The magnetic ﬂuctuations
generated by the ﬂuctuation dynamo also become expelled
in a similar fashion, but as the growth of these ﬂuctuations
is exponential due to the dynamo instability, the ﬂuctua-
tion dynamo can quickly replenish the ﬂuctuations also in
the internetwork regions. The tangling process can be en-
visioned to have an ampliﬁcation time scale that is slower,
only linear over time.

As is extensively reviewed in Brandenburg & Subra-
manian (2005), in turbulent dynamo theory, the magnetic
ﬁelds grow under the constraint of magnetic helicity con-

servation, which leads to a bihelical spectrum of magnetic
helicity. Signs of such bihelical nature of the solar surface
magnetic ﬁeld have already been reported by Brandenburg
et al. (2017); Singh et al. (2018). Accumulation of small-
scale magnetic helicity leads to the quenching of large-scale
dynamo. In order to further grow its large-scale magnetic
ﬁeld, the system must shed its small-scale helicity. Being
an open system, the Sun may have ﬂuxes of magnetic he-
licity where ARs could play a vital role in removing the
magnetic helicity from small-scales, thus leading to a reju-
venation of the large-scale dynamo. This mechanism was
proposed to lead to a phase shift between the cycles for
sunspot and magnetic helicity, that was seen to peak half a
year later than the sunspot cycle in Singh et al. (2018). We
see similar evidence here for the solar-cycle dependent part
of the magnetic ﬂuctuations in the network and internet-
work - the phase shift by half a year is consistent with the
large-scale ﬁeld being rejuvenated later, when ARs have al-
ready peaked, and shed some small-scale magnetic helicity
out from the system to allow for the growth of the global
ﬁeld.

The second part of our study built a novel method for
calibrating the f -mode energy using the very quiet patches

harvested in the ﬁrst part. Even though more than 22 000
patches were analysed to obtain the statistics over the so-
lar cycle, the f -mode energy variations of the QS remained
large, and they show no clear correlation with the rms mag-
netic ﬁeld strength measured at the surface. We interpret
this as an indication of the f -mode energy being aﬀected by
sub-surface magnetic ﬁelds, and the surface rms magnetic
ﬁeld being an inadequate indicator to ﬁnd the QS level.
The measured QS f -mode energy, indeed, shows a solar-
cycle variation, which is, in broad terms, anti-correlated
with the solar cycle, the f -mode energy being lower/higher
when the rms magnetic ﬁeld is strong/weak. Such a behav-
ior is expected in the light of many previous investigations,
which have suggested f -mode damping to occur as a result
of absorption of the f -mode mode by the magnetic ﬁelds in
ARs (Cally et al. 1994; Cally & Bogdan 1997; Singh et al.
2016). This eﬀect is the dominant one over the possible en-
hancement prior to AR emergence, as can be seen also in
the hindcasted AR data in this study. Combined with the
heavy averaging, any possible enhancement will be washed
out from a statistic measuring the global behavior.

The phase shift of several years between the sunspot cy-
cle and the f -mode modulation is too large to be explicable
by the scenario suggested above for the half a year phase
shift of the QS magnetism maximum w.r.t. the sunspot cy-
cle. The f -mode energy modulation appears to follow more
closely the poloidal component of the global ﬁeld than the
toroidal part that is commonly thought to give rise to the

ARs. These two ﬁeld components are known to have a sys-
tematic phase diﬀerence of roughly π (see, e.g., Charbon-
neau 2010).

The general trend of f -mode energy being reduced dur-
ing SC25 in comparison to SC24 could be a result of the
instrument aging, but the clear diﬀerences seen over dif-
ferent latitudes and hemispheres is speaking against of an
overall instrumental degradation. If it were a physical ef-
fect, it would suggest that the sub-surface magnetic ﬁeld is
stronger during the ascending phase of SC25 than the one
of SC24, and that could lead to SC25 being stronger than
SC24. Further investigations and ﬁne tuning of the method
are required to verify the results and conclusions reached
in this study, but the QS f -mode energy seems to have po-
tential applications in diagnosing the sub-surface magnetic
ﬁelds in the Sun.

The third and last part of our study presented two
hindcasted AR f -mode signals, that have been proposed
to show a clear enhancement of the f -mode energy in the
earlier studies (Singh et al. 2016; Waidele et al. 2022), with
our novel QS calibration method. In summary, our analy-
sis shows that the transient and weak enhancement signal
is very sensitive to the calibration method used. The new
method for the QS calibration developed here tends to show
a more ﬂat signal with mild enhancement only in compari-
son to the earlier calibration method of Singh et al. (2016).
Although in general a signature of an enhancement is seen,
it remains unclear whether it is an eﬀect caused by the un-
certainties close to the limb or a real eﬀect. In the light of
the QS data, the magnitude of the enhancement is weaker
than the QS variability level, and hence its detection and
usage as an AR emergence predictor is not possible with
the QS calibration method.
