We consider the most general (ﬁnite-dimensional) quantum mechanical information source, which
is given by a quantum system A that is correlated with a reference system R. The task is to compress
A in such a way as to reproduce the joint source state ρAR at the decoder with asymptotically
high ﬁdelity. This includes Schumacher’s original quantum source coding problem of a pure state
ensemble and that of a single pure entangled state, as well as general mixed state ensembles. Here,
we determine the optimal compression rate (in qubits per source system) in terms of the Koashi-
Imoto decomposition of the source into a classical, a quantum, and a redundant part. The same
decomposition yields the optimal rate in the presence of unlimited entanglement between compressor
and decoder, and indeed the full region of feasible qubit-ebit rate pairs.

I. WHAT IS A QUANTUM SOURCE?

A quantum source is a quantum system together correlations with a reference system. A criterion of how
well a source is reproduced in a communication task is to measure how well the correlations are preserved with
the reference system. Without correlation, the information does not make sense because a known quantum
state without correlations can be reproduced at the destination without any communication.

√

To elaborate more on these notions, consider the source that Schumacher deﬁned in his 1995 paper [1, 2]
as an ensemble of pure states {p(x), ∣ψx⟩A}, where the source generates the state ∣ψx⟩ with probability p(x).
The ﬁgure of merit for the encoding-decoding process is to keep the decoded quantum states on average
very close to the original states with respect to the ﬁdelity, where the average is taken over the probability
distribution p(x). By basic algebra one can show that this is equivalent to preserving the classical-quantum
state ρAX = ∑x p(x)∣ψx⟩⟨ψx∣A ⊗ ∣x⟩⟨x∣X , where system A is the quantum system to be compressed. Another
source model that Schumacher considered was the puriﬁcation of the source ensemble, that is the state
∣ψ⟩AR = ∑x
p(x)∣ψx⟩A∣x⟩R, where the ﬁgure of merit for the encoding-decoding process was to preserve the
pure state correlations with the reference system R by maintaining a high ﬁdelity between the decoded state
and ψ. He showed that both deﬁnitions lead to the same compression rate, namely, the von Neumann entropy
of the source S(A)ρ = S(ρA), where ρA = TrRρAR. Incidentally, the full proof of optimality in the ﬁrst model,
without any additional restrictions on the encoder, had to wait until [3] (see also [5]); the strong converse, i.e.
the optimality of the entropy rate even for constant error bounded away from 1, was eventually given in [4].
Another example of a quantum source is the mixed state source considered by Horodecki [5] and Barnum et
al. [6], and ﬁnally solved by Koashi and Imoto [7], where the source is deﬁned as an ensemble of mixed states
{p(x), ρA
x }. Preserving these mixed quantum states, on average, in the process of encoding-decoding, the
task is equivalent to preserving the state ρAX = ∑x p(x)ρA
x ⊗ ∣x⟩⟨x∣X , that is the quantum system A together
with its correlation with the classical reference system X.

The reference system is not usually considered in the description of classical information theory tasks, but
arguably it is conceptually necessary in quantum information. This is because it allows us to present the
ﬁgure of merit quantifying the decoding error as operationally accessible, for example via the probability of
passing a test in the form of a measurement on the combined AR-system. This point is made eloquently in
the early work of Schumacher on quantum information transmission [8, 9].

In this work, we consider the most general ﬁnite-dimensional source in the realm of quantum mechanics,
namely a quantum system A that is correlated with a reference system R in an arbitrary way, described by
the overall state ρAR. In particular, the reference does not necessarily purify the source, nor is it assumed to
be classical. The ensemble source and the pure source deﬁned by Schumacher are special cases of this model,
where the reference is a classical system in the former and a purifying system in the latter. So is the source
considered by Koashi and Imoto in [7], where the reference system is classical, too.

Understanding the compression of the source ρAR has paramount importance in the ﬁeld of quantum
information theory and uniﬁes all the models that have been considered in the literature. Schumacher’s pure
source model in a sense is the most stringent model because it requires preserving the correlations with a
purifying reference system which implies that the correlations with any other reference system is preserved
which follows from the fact that the ﬁdelity is non-decreasing under quantum channels. However, the converse
is not necessarily true: if in a compression task the parties are required to preserve the correlations with a
given reference system which does not purify the source state, they might be able to compress more eﬃciently
compared to the scenario where the reference system puriﬁes the source. This is exactly what we show in this
paper: we characterise the gap precisely depending on the reference system.

We ﬁnd the optimal trade-oﬀ between the quantum and entanglement rates of the compression which
are in terms of a decomposition of the state ρAR introduced in [10]. This decomposition is a generalization
of the decomposition introduced by Koashi and Imoto for a set of quantum states in [11], so when the
reference system is classical, the quantum rate reduces to the rate derived by Koashi and Imoto. We show the
optimality of the rates with a new converse proof which is based on the decoupling of the environment systems
of the encoding and decoding operations from the decoded systems and gives us an insight into how general
mixed states are processed in an encoding-decoding task. Our results also cover the entanglement assisted
compression task considered in [12] when the side information system is trivial, as well as the entanglement
assisted version of the Koashi-Imoto compression.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In the reminder of this section, we introduce the notation that we
use throughout the paper. In Sec. II, we rigorously deﬁne the task of the asymptotic compression of the source
ρAR, where as for the communication purposes, we let the encoder and decoder share initial entanglement,
and the encoder sends the compressed information to the decoder through a noiseless quantum channels. In
Sec. III, we ﬁrst introduce the Koashi-Imoto decomposition of the state ρAR, and then in Theorem 2 we state
the main result of this paper, that is the optimal rate region for the compression of the source in terms of
the trade-oﬀ between the entanglement and quantum rates, then we prove the achievability of the rates in
the same section, but we leave the converse proofs for the subsequent sections which need more involved
machinery. In Sec. IV, we deﬁne two functions which emerge in the converse proofs, and in Lemma 6 we
state some important properties of these functions which then we use to prove the tight asymptotic converse
bounds of Theorem 2. We prove Lemma 6 in Sec. V. Finally, in Sec. VI we discuss our results and some
related open problems.

Notation. Quantum systems are associated with (ﬁnite dimensional) Hilbert spaces A, R, etc., whose
dimensions are denoted by ∣A∣, ∣R∣, respectively. Since it is clear from the context, we slightly abuse the
notation and let Q denote both a quantum system and a quantum rate. The von Neumann entropy is deﬁned
as S(ρ) = −Trρ log ρ (throughout this paper, log denotes by default the binary logarithm). The conditional
entropy and the conditional mutual information, S(A∣B)ρ and I(A ∶ B∣C)ρ, respectively, are deﬁned in the
same way as their classical counterparts:

S(A∣B)ρ = S(AB)ρ − S(B)ρ, and
I(A ∶ B∣C)ρ = S(A∣C)ρ − S(A∣BC)ρ

= S(AC)ρ + S(BC)ρ − S(ABC)ρ − S(C)ρ.

The ﬁdelity between two states ρ and ξ is deﬁned as F (ρ, ξ) = ∥
∥X∥1 = Tr∣X∣ = Tr

II. THE COMPRESSION TASK

3

We will consider the information theoretic limit of many copies of the source ρAR, i.e. ρAnRn = (ρAR)
We assume that the encoder, Alice, and the decoder, Bob, have initially a maximally entangled state ΦA0B0
on registers A0 and B0 (both of dimension K). The encoder, Alice, performs the encoding compression
operation C ∶ AnA0 —→ M on the system An and her part A0 of the entanglement, which is a quantum
channel, i.e. a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map. Notice that as functions CPTP maps
act on the operators (density matrices) over the respective input and output Hilbert spaces, but as there is
no risk of confusion, we will simply write the Hilbert spaces when denoting a CPTP map. Alice’s encoding
operation produces the state σM B0Rn
with M and B0 as the compressed system of Alice and Bob’s part of the
entanglement, respectively. The dimension of the compressed system is without loss of generality not larger
than the dimension of the original source, i.e. ∣M ∣ ≤ ∣A∣n. We call 1
n log ∣M ∣ the entanglement
rate and quantum rate of the compression protocol, respectively. The system M is then sent to Bob via a
noiseless quantum channel, who performs a decoding operation D ∶ M B0 —→ ˆAn on the system M and his
part of the entanglement B0. We say the encoding-decoding scheme has ﬁdelity 1 − (cid:15), or error (cid:15), if

n log K and 1

⊗n

.

F (ρAnRn

, ξ

ˆAnRn

) ≥ 1 − (cid:15),

(2)

where ξ ˆAnRn = ((D ○ C) ⊗ idRn ) ρAnRn
. Moreover, we say that (E, Q) is an (asymptotically) achievable rate
pair if for all n there exist codes such that the ﬁdelity converges to 1, and the entanglement and quantum
rates converge to E and Q, respectively. The rate region is the set of all achievable rate pairs, as a subset of
R≥0 × R≥0.

According to Stinespring’s theorem [14], a CPTP map T ∶ A —→ ˆA can be dilated to an isometry
U ∶ A ↪ ˆAE with E as an environment system, called an isometric extension of a CPTP map, such that
T (ρA) = TrE(U ρAU †). Therefore, the encoding and decoding operations are can in general be viewed
as isometries UE ∶ AnA0 ↪ M W and UD ∶ M B0 ↪ ˆAnV , respectively, with the systems W and V as the
environment systems of Alice and Bob, respectively.

We say a source ωBR is equivalent to a source ρAR if there are CPTP maps T ∶ A —→ B and R ∶ B —→ A

in both directions taking one to the other:

ωBR = (T ⊗ idR)ρAR and ρAR = (R ⊗ idR)ωBR.

(3)

The rate regions of equivalent sources are the same, because any achievable rate pair for one source is
achievable for the other source as well. This follows from the fact that for any code (C, D) of block length
n and error (cid:15) for ρAR, concatenating the encoding and decoding operations with T and R, i.e.
letting
C′ = C ○ R⊗n and D′ = T ⊗n ○ D, we get a code of the same error (cid:15) for ωBR. Analogously we can turn a code
for ωBR into one for ρAR.

III. THE QUBIT-EBIT RATE REGION

The idea behind the compression of the source ρAR is based on a decomposition of this state introduced in
[10], which is a generalization of the decomposition introduced by Koashi and Imoto in [11]. Namely, for any
set of quantum states {ρx}, there is a unique decomposition of the Hilbert space describing the structure of
x }. This idea was generalized in [10] for a general mixed state ρAR
CPTP maps which preserve the set {ρA
describing the structure of CPTP maps acting on system A which preserve the overall state ρAR. This was
achieved by showing that any such map preserves the set of all possible states on system A which can be
obtained by measuring system R, and conversely any map preserving the set of all possible states on system
A obtained by measuring system R, preserves the state ρAR, thus reducing the general case to the case of
classical-quantum states

ρAY = ∑
y

q(y)ρA

y ⊗ ∣y⟩⟨y∣Y = ∑
y

TrRρAR(11A ⊗ M R

y ) ⊗ ∣y⟩⟨y∣Y ,

which is the ensemble case considered by Koashi and Imoto. As a matter of fact, looking at the algorithm
presented in [11] to compute the decomposition, it is enough to consider an informationally complete POVM
(My) on R, with no more than ∣R∣2 many outcomes. The properties of this decomposition are stated in the
following theorem.

Theorem 1 ([10, 11]) Associated to the state ρAR, there are Hilbert spaces C, N and Q and an isometry
UKI ∶ A ↪ CN Q such that:

4

1. The state ρAR is transformed by UKI as

(4)

where the set of vectors {∣j⟩C} form an orthonormal basis for Hilbert space C, and pj is a probability
distribution over j. The states ωN

act on the Hilbert spaces N and Q ⊗ R, respectively.

2. For any CPTP map Λ acting on system A which leaves the state ρAR invariant, that is (Λ ⊗ idR)ρAR =
ρAR, every associated isometric extension U ∶ A ↪ AE of Λ with the environment system E is of the
following form

U = (UKI ⊗ 11E)† ⎛

†
where the isometries Uj ∶ N ↪ N E satisfy TrE[UjωjU
j ] = ωj for all j. The isometry UKI is unique (up
to trivial change of basis of the Hilbert spaces C, N and Q). Henceforth, we call the isometry UKI and
the state ωCN QR = ∑j pj∣j⟩⟨j∣C ⊗ ωN
the Koashi-Imoto (KI) isometry and KI-decomposition of
the state ρAR, respectively.

j ⊗ ρQR

j

3. In the particular case of a tripartite system CN Q and a state ωCN QR already in Koashi-Imoto form (4),
property 2 says the following: For any CPTP map Λ acting on systems CN Q with (Λ ⊗ idR)ωCN QR =
ωCN QR, every associated isometric extension U ∶ CN Q ↪ CN QE of Λ with the environment system E
is of the form

U = ∑
j

∣j⟩⟨j∣C ⊗ U N

j ⊗ 11Q
j ,

(6)

where the isometries Uj ∶ N ↪ N E satisfy TrE[UjωjU

†
j ] = ωj for all j.

According to the discussion at the end of Sec. II, the sources ρAR and ωCN QR are equivalent because
there are the isometry UKI and the reversal CPTP map R ∶ CN Q —→ A, which reverses the action of the KI
isometry, such that:

ωCN QR = (UKI ⊗ 11R)ρAR(U

ρAR = (R ⊗ idR)ωCN QR = (U

†
KI ⊗ 11R)
†
KI ⊗ 11R)ωCN QR(UKI ⊗ 11R) + Tr[(11CN Q − ΠCN Q)ωCN Q]σ,

(7)

†
where ΠCN Q = UKIU
KI is the projection onto the subspace UKIA ⊂ C ⊗ N ⊗ Q, and σ is an arbitrary state
acting on A ⊗ R. Henceforth we assume that the source is ωCN QR, which is convenient because our main
result is expressed in terms of the systems C and Q. Notice that the source ωCN QR is in turn equivalent to
ωCQR, a fact we will exploit in the proof.

Moreover, since the information in C is classical, we can reduce the compression rate even more if the
sender and receiver share entanglement, by using dense coding of j. In the following theorem we show the
optimal qubit-ebit rate tradeoﬀ for the compression of the source ρAR.

Theorem 2 For the compression of the source ρAR, all asymptotically achievable entanglement and quantum
rate pairs (E, Q) satisfy

Q ≥ S(CQ)ω −

1
2

S(C)ω,

Q + E ≥ S(CQ)ω,

where the entropies are with respect the KI decomposition of the state ρAR, i.e. the state ωCN QR. Conversely,
all the rate pairs satisfying the above inequalities are asymptotically achievable.

Remark 3 This theorem implies that the optimal asymptotic quantum rates for the compression of the source
ρAR with and without entanglement assistance are S(CQ)ω − 1
2 S(C)ω and S(CQ)ω qubits, respectively, and
1
2 S(C)ω ebits of entanglement are suﬃcient and necessary in the entanglement assisted case.

Remark 4 If in the compression task the parties were required to preserve the correlations with a purifying
reference system, then due to Schumacher compression the optimal qubit rate would be S(A)ρ = S(CN Q)ω.
However, Theorem 2 shows that the parties can compress more if they are only required to preserve the
correlations with a mixed state reference. This gap can be strictly positive if the redundant system N is mixed
given the classical information j in system C, that is S(CN Q)ω − S(CQ)ω = S(N ∣CQ)ω > 0.

Figure 1. The achievable rate region of the entanglement and quantum rates.

2 S(C)ω, S(CQ)ω − 1

Proof. We start with the achievability of these rates. The converse proofs need more tools, so we will
leave them to the subsequent sections. Looking at Fig. 1, it will be enough to prove the achievability of
the corresponding corner points (E, Q) = (0, S(CQ)ω) and (E, Q) = ( 1
2 S(C)ω) for the
unassisted and entanglement assisted cases, respectively. This is because by deﬁnition (and the time-sharing
principle) the rate region is convex and upper-right closed. Indeed, all the points on the line Q + E = S(CQ)ω
for Q ≥ S(CQ)ω − 1
2 S(C)ω are achievable because one ebit can be distributed by sending a qubit. All other
rate pairs are achievable by resource wasting. The rate region is depicted in Fig. 1.
As we discussed, we can assume that the source is (ωCN QR)⊗n = ωCnN nQnRn

. To achieve the point
(0, S(CQ)ω), Alice traces out the redundant part N n of the source, to get the state ωCnQnRn
and applies
Schumacher compression to send the systems C nQn to Bob. Since the Schumacher compression preserves
the puriﬁcation of the systems C nQn, it preserves the state ωCnQnRn
as well. To be more speciﬁc, let ΛS
denote the composition of the encoding and decoding operations for the Schumacher compression of the state
∣ω⟩CnQnRnR′n
where the system R′n is a purifying reference system which of course the parties do not have
access to. The Schumacher compression preserves the following ﬁdelity on the left member of the equation,
therefore it preserves the ﬁdelity on the right member:

1 − (cid:15) ≤ F (ωCnQnRnR′ n

, (ΛS ⊗ idRnR′n )ωCnQnRnR′n

) ≤ F (ωCnQnRn

, (ΛS ⊗ idRn )ωCnQnRn

) ,

where the inequality is due to monotonicity of the ﬁdelity under partial trace. The rate achieved by this
scheme is S(CQ)ω. After applying this scheme, Bob has access to the systems ˆC n ˆQn, which is correlated

6

with the reference system Rn:

ˆCn ˆQnRn

ζ

= (ΛS ⊗ idRn )ωCnQnRn

.

Then, to reconstruct the system N n, Bob applies the CPTP map N ∶ CQ —→ CN Q to each copy, which acts
as follows:

N (ρCQ) = ∑
j

(∣j⟩⟨j∣C ⊗ 11Q)ρCQ(∣j⟩⟨j∣C ⊗ 11Q) ⊗ ωN
j .

This map satisﬁes the ﬁdelity criterion of Eq. (8) because of monotonicity of the ﬁdelity under CPTP maps:

1 − (cid:15) ≤ F (ωCnQnRn

, ζ

ˆCn ˆQnRn

)

2 S(C)ω, S(CQ)ω − 1

To achieve the point ( 1
2 S(C)ω), Alice applies dense coding to send the classical system
C n to Bob which requires n
2 S(C)ω qubits [15]. When both
Alice and Bob have access to system C n, Alice can send the quantum system Qn to Bob by applying
Schumacher compression, which requires sending nS(Q∣C) qubits to Bob. Therefore, the overall qubit rate is
2 S(C)ω + S(Q∣C) = S(CQ)ω − 1

IV. CONVERSE

In this section, we will provide the converse bounds for the qubit rate Q and the sum rate Q + E of
Theorem 2. We obtain these bounds based on the structure of the CPTP maps which preserve the source
state ωCN QR. Namely, according to Theorem 1 the CPTP maps acting on systems CN Q, which preserve
the state ωCN QR, act only on the redundant system N . This implies that the environment systems of such
CPTP maps are decoupled from systems QR given the classical information j in the classical system C.
This gives us an insight into the structure of the encoding-decoding maps, which preserve the overall state
asymptotically intact.

To proceed with the proof, we ﬁrst deﬁne two functions that emerge in the converse bounds. Then, we state
some important properties of these functions in Lemma 6 which we will use to compute the tight asymptotic
converse bounds.

In this deﬁnition, the dimension of the environment is w.l.o.g. bounded as ∣E∣ ≤ (∣C∣∣N ∣∣Q∣)2 because the
input and output dimensions of the channel are ﬁxed as ∣C∣∣N ∣∣Q∣; hence, the optimisation is of a continuous
function over a compact domain, so we have a maximum rather than a supremum.

Lemma 6 The functions Z(cid:15)(ω) and J(cid:15)(ω) have the following properties:

1. They are non-decreasing functions of (cid:15).

7

2. They are concave in (cid:15).

3. They are continuous for (cid:15) ≥ 0.

4. For any two states ωC1N1Q1R1

1

and ωC2N2Q2R2
2

and for (cid:15) ≥ 0,

J(cid:15)(ω1 ⊗ ω2) ≤ J(cid:15)(ω1) + J(cid:15)(ω2),
Z(cid:15)(ω1 ⊗ ω2) ≤ Z(cid:15)(ω1) + Z(cid:15)(ω2).

5. At (cid:15) = 0, Z0(ω) = S(N ∣C)ω and J0(ω) = 0.

The proof of this lemma follows in the next section. Now we show how it is used to prove the converse
(optimality) of Theorem 2. As a guide to reading the subsequent proof, we remark that in Eqs. (24) and (28),
the environment systems V W of the encoding-decoding operations appear in the terms I( ˆN nV W ∶ ˆC n ˆQn∣C ′n)
and S( ˆN nV W ∣C ′n), which are bounded by the functions J(cid:15)(ω⊗n) and Z(cid:15)(ω⊗n), respectively. As stated in
point 4 of Lemma 6, these functions are sub-additive, so basically we can single-letterize the terms appearing
in the converse. Moreover, from point 3 of Lemma 6, we know that these functions are continuous for (cid:15) ≥ 0;
therefore, the limit points of these functions are equal to the values of these functions at (cid:15) = 0. When the
ﬁdelity is equal to 1 ((cid:15) = 0), the structure of the CPTP maps preserving the state ωCN QR in Theorem 1
implies that J0(ω) = 0 and Z0(ω) = S(N ∣C)ω, as stated in point 5 of Lemma 6. Thereby, we conclude the
converse bounds in Eqs. (27) and (31).

Proof of Theorem 2 (converse). We ﬁrst get the following chain of inequalities considering the process of the
decoding of the information:

nQ + S(B0) ≥ S(M ) + S(B0)

≥ S(M B0)
= S( ˆC n ˆN n ˆQnV )
= S( ˆC n ˆQn) + S( ˆN nV ∣ ˆC n ˆQn)
≥ nS(CQ) + S( ˆN nV ∣ ˆC n ˆQn) − nδ(n, (cid:15))
≥ nS(CQ) + S( ˆN nV ∣ ˆC n ˆQnC ′n) − nδ(n, (cid:15))
= nS(CQ) + S( ˆN nV ∣ ˆC n ˆQnC ′n) − S( ˆN nV ∣C ′n) + S( ˆN nV ∣C ′n) − nδ(n, (cid:15))
= nS(CQ) − I( ˆN nV ∶ ˆC n ˆQn∣C ′n) + S( ˆN nV ∣C ′n) − nδ(n, (cid:15))
≥ nS(CQ) − I( ˆN nV W ∶ ˆC n ˆQn∣C ′n) + S( ˆN nV ∣C ′n) − nδ(n, (cid:15))

where Eq. (9) follows because the entropy of a system is bounded by the logarithm of the dimension
of that system; Eq. (10) is due to sub-additivity of the entropy; Eq. (11) follows because the decoding
isometry UD ∶ M B0 ↪ ˆC n ˆN n ˆQnV does not change the entropy; Eq. (12) is due to the chain rule; Eq. (13)
follows from the decodability: the output state on systems ˆC n ˆQn is 2
2(cid:15)-close to the original state C nQn
in trace norm; then the inequality follows by applying the Fannes-Audenaert inequality [16, 17], where
2(cid:15)); Eq. (14) is due to strong sub-additivity of the entropy, and system C ′ is
δ(n, (cid:15)) =
a copy of classical system C; Eq. (15) follows from data processing inequality where W is the environment
system of the encoding isometry UE ∶ C nN nQnA0 ↪ M W .

where Eq. (16) is due to sub-additivity of the entropy; Eq. (17) is due to the chain rule; Eq. (18) follows
because the encoding isometry UE ∶ C nN nQnA0 ↪ M W does not the change the entropy; Eq. (19) follows
because the initial entanglement A0 is independent from the source; Eq. (20) is due to the chain rule; Eq. (21)
follows because C ′ is a copy of the system C, so S(C ′∣CN Q) = 0; Eq. (22) is due to the chain rule and the
fact that the entropy is additive for product states; Eq. (23) follows because conditional on system C the
system N is independent from system Q.

Now, we add Eqs. (15) and (23); the entanglement terms S(A0) and S(B0) cancel out, and by dividing by

In the limit of (cid:15) → 0 and n → ∞, we thus obtain the following bound on the rate sum:

where the equality follows from point 5 of Lemma 6.

Q + E ≥ S(CQ) − J0(ω) = S(CQ),

∎

Remark 7 Our lower bound on Q + E in Eq. (31) reproduces the result of Koashi and Imoto [7] for the
case of a classical-quantum source ρAX = ∑x p(x)ρA
x ⊗ ∣x⟩⟨x∣X . This is because a code with qubit-ebit rate pair
(Q, E) gives rise to a compression code in the sense of Koashi and Imoto using a rate of qubits Q + E and no
prior entanglement, simply by ﬁrst distributing E ebits and then using the entanglement assisted code.

It is worth noting that conversely, Eq. (31) can be obtained from the Koashi-Imoto result, as follows. Any

for any POVM (My) on R, simply by the monotonicity of the ﬁdelity under CPTP maps. As discussed before,
by choosing an informationally complete measurement, the KI-decomposition of the ensemble {q(y), ρA
y } is
identical to that of ρAR in Theorem 1. Thus the unassisted qubit compression rate of ρAY and of ρAR are
lower bounded by the same quantity, the right hand side of Eq. (31).

V. PROOF OF LEMMA 6

1. The deﬁnitions of the functions J(cid:15)(ω) and Z(cid:15)(ω) directly imply that they are non-decreasing functions

of (cid:15).

2. We ﬁrst prove the concavity of Z(cid:15)(ω). Let U1 ∶ CN Q ↪ ˆC ˆN ˆQE and U2 ∶ CN Q ↪ ˆC ˆN ˆQE be the
isometries attaining the maximum for (cid:15)1 and (cid:15)2, respectively, which act as follows on the puriﬁcation
∣ω⟩CN QRC′R′

of the previously introduced state ωCN QRC′

and ∣τ2⟩ ˆC ˆN ˆQERC′R′

∣τ1⟩ ˆC ˆN ˆQERC′R′

= (U1 ⊗ 11RC′R′)∣ω⟩CN QRC′R′

= (U2 ⊗ 11RC′R′)∣ω⟩CN QRC′R′

,

where TrR′[∣ω⟩⟨ω∣CN QRC′R′ ] = ωCN QRC′
which acts as

. For 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, deﬁne the isometry U0 ∶ CN Q ↪ ˆC ˆN ˆQEF F ′

Then, U0 deﬁnes its state τ . for which the reduced state on the systems ˆC ˆN ˆQRC ′ is

Therefore, the ﬁdelity for the state τ is bounded as follows:

)

The ﬁrst inequality is due to simultaneous concavity of the ﬁdelity in both arguments; the last line
follows by the deﬁnition of the isometries U1 and U2. Thus, the isometry U0 yields a ﬁdelity of at least
1 − (λ(cid:15)1 + (1 − λ)(cid:15)2) =∶ 1 − (cid:15). Now let E′ = EF F ′ denote the environment of the isometry U0 deﬁned
above. According to Deﬁnition 5, we obtain
Z(cid:15)(ω) ≥ S( ˆN E′∣C ′)τ

= S( ˆN EF F ′∣C ′)τ
= S(F ∣C ′)τ + S( ˆN E∣F C ′)τ + S(F ′∣ ˆN EF C ′)τ
≥ S( ˆN E∣F C ′)τ
= λS( ˆN E∣C ′)τ1 + (1 − λ)S( ˆN E∣C ′)τ2
= λZ(cid:15)1 (ω) + (1 − λ)Z(cid:15)2 (ω),

(37)

(38)
(39)

where the state τ in the entropies is given in Eq. (34); Eq. (36) is due to the chain rule; Eq. (37) follow
because for the state on systems ˆN EF F ′C ′ we have S(F ′∣C ′) + S(F ′∣ ˆN EF C ′) ≥ 0 which follows from
strong sub-additivity of the entropy; Eq. (38) follows by expanding the conditional entropy on the
classical system F ; Eq. (39) follows from the deﬁnitions of the isometries U1 and U2.
Moreover, let U1 ∶ CN Q ↪ ˆC ˆN ˆQE and U2 ∶ CN Q ↪ ˆC ˆN ˆQE be the isometries attaining the maximum
for (cid:15)1 and (cid:15)2 in the deﬁnition of J(cid:15)(ω), respectively. Again, deﬁne the isometry U0 as in Eq. (32), which
leads to the bound on the ﬁdelity as in Eq. (35), letting E′ = EF F ′ be the environment of the isometry
U0. According to Deﬁnition 5, we obtain

10

J(cid:15)(ω) ≥ I( ˆN EF F ′ ∶ ˆC ˆQ∣C ′)τ

≥ I( ˆN EF ∶ ˆC ˆQ∣C ′)τ
= I(F ∶ ˆC ˆQ∣C ′)τ + I( ˆN E ∶ ˆC ˆQ∣F C ′)τ
≥ I( ˆN E ∶ ˆC ˆQ∣F C ′)τ
= λI( ˆN E ∶ ˆC ˆQ∣C ′)τ1 + (1 − λ)I( ˆN E ∶ ˆC ˆQ∣C ′)τ2
= λJ(cid:15)1(ω) + (1 − λ)J(cid:15)2 (ω),

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)
(44)

where Eq. (40) follows from data processing; Eq. (41) is due to the chain rule for mutual information;
Eq. (42) follows from strong sub-additivity of the entropy, I(F ∶ ˆC ˆQ∣C ′)τ ≥ 0; Eq. (43) is obtained by
expanding the conditional mutual information on the classical system F ; ﬁnally, Eq. (44) follows from
the deﬁnitions of the isometries U1 and U2.

3. The functions are non-decreasing and concave for (cid:15) ≥ 0, so they are continuous for (cid:15) > 0. The concavity
implies furthermore that J(cid:15) and Z(cid:15) are lower semi-continuous at (cid:15) = 0. On the other hand, since the
ﬁdelity, the conditional entropy and the conditional mutual information are all continuous functions of
CPTP maps, and the domain of both optimizations is a compact set, we conclude that J(cid:15)(ω) and Z(cid:15)
are also upper semi-continuous at (cid:15) = 0, so they are continuous at (cid:15) = 0 [18, Thms. 10.1 and 10.2].

4. We ﬁrst prove Z(cid:15)(ω1 ⊗ ω2) ≤ Z(cid:15)(ω1) + Z(cid:15)(ω2).

In the deﬁnition of Z(cid:15)(ω1 ⊗ ω2), let the isometry
U0 ∶ C1N1Q1C2N2Q2 ↪ ˆC1 ˆN1 ˆQ1 ˆC2 ˆN2 ˆQ2E be the one attaining the maximum, which acts on the
following puriﬁed source states with purifying systems R′

Now, we can deﬁne an isometry U1 ∶ C1N1Q1 ↪ ˆC1 ˆN1 ˆQ1E1 acting only on systems C1N1Q1, by letting
2R′
U1 = (U0 ⊗ 11R2C′

It has the property that ∣τ ⟩ ˆC1 ˆN1 ˆQ1R1C′
1 has the same reduced
state on ˆC1 ˆN1 ˆQ1R1 as τ from Eq. (45). This isometry preserves the ﬁdelity for ω1, which follows from

VI. DISCUSSION

We have introduced a common framework for all single-source quantum compression problems, i.e. settings
without side information at the encoder or the decoder, by deﬁning the compression task as the reproduction
of a given bipartite state between the system to be compressed and a reference. That state, which deﬁnes the
task, can be completely general, and special instances recover Schumacher’s quantum source compression (in
both variants of a pure state ensemble and of a pure entangled state) [1] and compression of a mixed state
ensemble source in the blind variant [5, 7].

Our general result gives the optimal quantum compression rate in terms of qubits per source, both in
the settings without and with entanglement, and indeed the entire qubit-ebit rate region, reproducing the
aforementioned special cases, along with other previously considered problems [12]. Despite the technical
diﬃculties in obtaining it, the end result has a simple and intuitive interpretation. Namely, the given source
ρAR is equivalent to a source in standard Koashi-Imoto form,

ωCQR = ∑
j

pj∣j⟩⟨j∣C ⊗ ρQR

j

,

so that j has to be compressed as classical information, at rate S(C), and Q as quantum information, at rate
S(Q∣C); in the presence of entanglement, the former rate is halved while the latter is maintained. Indeed,
what our Theorem 2 shows is that the original source has the same qubit-ebit rate region as the clean
classical-quantum mixed source

ΩCQRR′C′

= ∑
j

pj∣j⟩⟨j∣C ⊗ ∣ψj⟩⟨ψj∣QRR′

⊗ ∣j⟩⟨j∣C′

,

j

puriﬁes ρQR

where ∣ψj⟩QRR′
, and RR′C ′ is considered the reference. In Ω, C is indeed a manifestly classical
source, since it is duplicated in the reference system, and conditional on C, Q is a genuinely quantum
source since it is purely entangled with the reference system. As TrR′C′ΩCQRR′C′ = ωCQR, any code and any
achievable rates for Ω are good for ω, and that is how the achievability of the rate region in Theorem 2 can
be described. The opposite, that a code good for ω should be good for Ω, is far from obvious. Indeed, if
that were true, it would not only yield a quick and simple proof of our converse bounds, but would imply
that the rate region of Theorem 2 satisﬁes a strong converse! However, as we do not know this reduction to
the source Ω, our converse proceeds via a more complicated, indirect route, and yields only a weak converse.
Whether the strong converse holds, and what the detailed relation between the sources ωCQR and ΩCQRR′C′
is, remain open questions.

As we were ﬁnishing the write-up of the present paper, we became aware of related work by Anshu et al.
[19], who consider a source consisting of a commuting mixed state ensemble, with the aim of showing a large
separation between the Holevo information of the ensemble and the actual (blind) compression rate of the
ensemble, even at non-zero error. Unlike our work, which follows source coding convention by considering
block error, they deﬁne the error as “error (inﬁdelity) per letter”, which is a weaker requirement, and prove
a rate lower bound in their [19, Thm. 2]. It is worth noting that ﬁrst, our lower bounds in Theorem 2
only require the error per letter criterion, and that indeed Eqs. (26) and (30) give rate lower bounds for
asymptotically large n and non-zero error (cid:15), which in addition in the limit (cid:15) → 0 become tight:

Q ≥ S(CQ) −

√

where J(cid:15) and Z(cid:15) are as in Deﬁnition 5, and δ((cid:15)) =

2(cid:15) log(∣C∣∣Q∣).
