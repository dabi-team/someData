We study ionization dynamics of aligned diatomic molecules N2 in strong elliptical laser ﬁelds
experimentally and theoretically. The alignment dependence of photoelectron momentum distri-
butions (PMDs) of N2 measured in experiments is highlighted with comparing to Ar measured
synchronously. Our results show that the PMDs of N2 depend strongly on the alignment of the
molecule, relative to the main axis of the laser ellipse. In particular, the most-probable electron-
emission angle which is often used in attosecond measurement, diﬀers remarkably when changing
the molecular alignment. We show that the interplay of two-center interference and tunneling when
the electron goes through the laser-Coulomb-formed barrier, plays an important role in these phe-
nomena. Our work gives suggestions on studying ultrafast electron motion inside aligned molecules.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Tunneling is one of the most fundamental physical pro-
cesses in the interaction of atoms and molecules with
strong laser ﬁelds. The electronic wave packet created
through tunneling triggers rich ultrafast dynamical pro-
cesses such as above-threshold ionization (ATI) [1–4],
autoionization [5, 6], photoelectron holography [7–10],
photoelectron diﬀraction [11–13], nonsequential double
ionization (NSDI) [14–18], and high-harmonic genera-
tion (HHG) [19–22], etc. Using these processes, peo-
ple can probe the structure of the target and trace
the electron motion in atoms and molecules on the at-
tosecond time scale, opening the new research region
in ultrafast science, namely attosecond physics [23–25].
Therefore, studies on the electron dynamics inside atoms
and molecules in the tunneling process are of basic sig-
niﬁcance for understandings and applications of these
tunneling-triggered strong-ﬁeld processes.

Strong-ﬁeld tunneling can be well described with the-
ories of ADK [26, 27], PPT [28] and strong-ﬁeld approx-
imation (SFA) [29, 30]. These theories provide deep in-
sights into roles of structure of the target in tunneling
ionization. In the frame of SFA with saddle-point the-
ory, the motion of the tunneling electron under the bar-
rier, which is formed by the laser ﬁeld and the Coulomb
potential, is characterized by an imaginary momentum.
For aligned symmetric diatomic molecules [31] with a not
very large internuclear distance R, it has been shown that
the interference of the electronic wave between these two
atomic centers of the molecule under the barrier induces
the remarkable increase of ionization yields of the target
molecule in comparison with its partner atom with a sim-
ilar ionization potential Ip [32–34]. Further theoretical
studies showed that this eﬀect has important inﬂuences
on alignment dependence of ATI [35, 36], HHG [37] and
NSDI [38] of symmetric molecules, as well as ATI and
HHG of oriented asymmetric molecules [39].

On the other hand, photoelectron momentum distribu-
tions (PMDs) in strong elliptically-polarized laser ﬁelds
with large ellipticity have been widely used in probing
the tunneling dynamics of atoms and molecules, and
the relevant probing procedure has been termed as atto-
clock [40, 41]. In the attoclock experiments, the bright-
est part of PMD, which is associated with the most-
probable emission angle of the photoelectron, is generally
used as the observable characteristic quantity through
which the key dynamical information of the studied sys-
tem is deduced [40–52]. For example, with this charac-
teristic quantity, the intriguing issues of tunneling time
[40, 41, 43, 45, 47–51], tunneling exit [42], nonadia-
batic eﬀects in tunneling [44], excited tunneling [46],
permanent-dipole eﬀects in tunneling [52], etc., have been
explored deeply.

In the attoclock experiments of molecular targets, it
is important to study the eﬀect of two-center interfer-
ence under the barrier on the most-probable emission
angle when the molecule is aligned along a speciﬁc angle
relative to the laser polarization. Since many dynam-
ical properties of molecules in intense laser ﬁelds such
as tunneling [27] and excitation [34] depend strongly on
the molecular alignment. Such studies can be performed
theoretically with assuming perfect alignment [36]. How-
ever, in experiments, perfect alignment is impossible and
therefore a clear identiﬁcation of the interference eﬀect is
not easy to achieve.

In this paper, we study ionization dynamics of the N2
molecule in strong elliptical laser ﬁelds at diﬀerent align-
ment angles θ (θ, the angle between the molecular axis
and the major axis of the laser ellipse) experimentally,
with synchronous measurements of N2 and Ar. Then we
compare the experimental results with those obtained
with numerical solution of time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation (TDSE) and a modiﬁed SFA model (MSFA)
which considers the eﬀect of long-range Coulomb po-
tential. To overcome the diﬃculty of imperfect align-

 
 
 
 
 
 
ment and highlight the eﬀect of a speciﬁc alignment an-
gle, we analyze the relative PMD related to the diﬀer-
ence between PMDs of aligned N2 and Ar synchronously
measured in experiments. The relative PMD shows the
strong dependence on the molecular alignment, and the
corresponding oﬀset angle φ (φ, the angle between the
most-probable electron-emission direction and the minor
axis of the laser ellipse) shifts remarkably when the an-
gle θ changes. In addition, the distribution of transverse
momentum of the molecule also diﬀers remarkably for dif-
ferent angles θ and diﬀers from that of the reference atom
Ar. These results are in good agreement with TDSE and
MSFA predictions. Our further analyses show that the
eﬀect of two-center interference under the barrier which
is sensitive to the angle θ plays an important role in
the alignment dependence of PMD of molecules, with
remarkably aﬀecting the oﬀset angle and the transverse
momentum.

II. EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL
METHODS

A. Experimental setup

Our experiment setup includes a pump-probe laser sys-
tem and a cold target recoil ion momentum spectrometer
(COLTRIMS)[53]. The experimental device was intro-
duced in our previous publications in detail [6, 53, 54],
where the produced ions and electrons are coincidence
measured. The laser pulses in our experiments are gener-
ated from a Ti: sapphire femtosecond laser system (∼35
fs) with a repetition rate of 1 kHz at the wavelength of
800 nm. The laser beams are focused on the supersonic
beam with a concave mirror (f=75 mm) to ionize the
atoms and molecules. A linearly-polarized laser and an
elliptically-polarized laser are chosen as the pump and
probe lasers. The pumping laser is stretching to around
300 fs by passing through a 5 cm BK7 glass. The po-
larization of probing laser is achieved by adjusting the
relative angle between half-wave plate and quarter-wave
plate, and the ellipticity of the probing laser is set as
ε∼0.8. The alignment of N2 is triggered by the pump-
ing laser and the revival of alignment is monitored by
scanning the delay time between pumping and probing
lasers [55, 56]. The pump laser beam has a diameter of
around 8 mm and the diameter of probing laser beam is
12 mm, this setup is to ensure that only aligned molecules
prepared by pumping laser are ionized by probing laser.
The brief process of experiment is exhibited in Fig. 1.
In order to compare ionization mechanism of molecule
with atom, a gas mixture containing N2 and Ar (2:1) is
applied to reduce any possible diﬀerence of experimental
conditions in the measurements for diatomic molecules
and their companion atoms. We keep the pumping laser
to a suﬃciently low intensity so that ionization rate is
low enough. The aligned samples (cos2θ ∼ 0.65) are pre-
pared by setting the probing laser at ∼ 3.9 ps, the relative

angle between the molecular axis and the major axis of
ellipsoidal light is controlled by rotating the polarization
of the pump laser.

B. Numerical methods

The Hamiltonian of the model molecule studied here

has the form of

H(t) = H0 + r · E(t)

(1)

with the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian H0 = p2/2 + V (r). We
use the soft-Coulomb potential

cases. Here, R is the internuclear distance. The indices
i and o denote the inner and outer limits of Z1 and Z2,
ρ is the screening parameter. ξ = 0.5 is the smoothing
parameter which is used to avoid the Coulomb singular-
ity. We have used the parameters [37] of Z1i=Z2i = 5,
Z1o = Z2o=0.5, ρ = 1.555 and R = 2.079 a.u. for N2 with
the ionization potential of Ip = 0.57 a.u.. For compari-
son, the parameters of Z1i = Z2i = 0.517, Z1o = Z2o = 0,
ρ = 0 and R = 0 a.u. are also used for a model Ar atom
with a similar Ip to N2. E(t) = Ez(t)~ez + Ey(t)~ey with
Ez(t) = f (t)
√1+ε2 sinω0t
√1+ε2 cosω0t and Ey(t) = εf (t)
is the laser electric ﬁeld. ε is the laser ellipticity and ε0
is the laser amplitude relating to the peak laser intensity
I. f (t) is the envelope function, ω0 is the laser frequency
and ~ez(~ey) is the unit vector along the major (minor)
axis of the polarization ellipse.
In our simulations, we
employ a 15-cycles laser pulse which is switched on and
oﬀ linearly over three optical cycles and keeps a constant
intensity for nine additional cycles.

We solve the TDSE of i ˙Ψ(r, t) = H(t)Ψ(r, t) numer-
ically through the spectral method [57]. The numerical
details can be found in [35]. In our simulations, for N2,

ε0

we select the eigenstate of H0 with 3σg symmetry as the
initial state, and for the model Ar atom, the eigenstate of
the corresponding H0 with 1s symmetry is selected. The
ground state of the active electron of the real Ar atom
has the 3p symmetry. However, in our experiments, the
Ar atom is randomly distributed, so it behaves similarly
to an atom with s symmetry.

C. Strong-ﬁeld approximation

In the SFA, the amplitude of the photoelectron with

the drift momentum p can be written as [29]

t{[p + A(t′)]2/2 + Ip}dt′ is
Here, the term S(p, t) =
the semiclassical action and Tp is the length of the to-
R
tal pulse. The term di(v) = hv|r|0i denotes the dipole
matrix element for the bound-free transition. The term
t E(t′)dt′ is the vector potential of the electric
A(t) = −
ﬁeld E(t).
R

For the laser ﬁeld with high intensity and low fre-
quency, the temporal integral in Eq.
(3) can be eval-
uated by the saddle-point method [29, 30], with solving
the following equation

[p + A(ts)]2/2 + Ip = 0.

(4)

The solution ts of the above equation is complex which
can be written as ts = t0 +iti. The real part t0 can be un-
derstood as the ionization time, and the imaginary part
ti can be understood as the tunneling time. The corre-
sponding momentum-time pair (p, t0) have been termed
as electronic trajectory. The corresponding amplitude of
the trajectory (p, t0) can be written as

F (p, t0) ≡ F (p, ts) ∝

βE(ts) · di(p + A(ts))eiS

,

(5)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

with S ≡ S(p, ts) and β ≡ (1/det(ts))1/2. The term
det(ts) in the deﬁnition of β is the determinant of the
matrix formed by the second derivatives of the action
[29]. The whole amplitude for photoelectron with a mo-
mentum p can be written as

c(p) ∝

Xs

F (p, ts).

(6)

The sum runs over all possible saddle points.

The SFA neglects the Coulomb eﬀect which is impor-
tant for the appearance of the nonzero oﬀset angle in
PMD of elliptical laser ﬁelds [40, 41]. To consider the
Coulomb eﬀect, we use a MSFA model [58] following the
semiclassical procedures in [59–61]. In this model, after
tunneling, the electron motion in the combined laser and
Coulomb ﬁelds is governed by the Newton equation

¨r(p, t) = −E(t) − ∇rV (r)

(7)

for each SFA electron trajectory (p, t0) with initial con-
ditions of exit momentum ˙r(p, t0) = p + A(t0) and exit

position r(p, t0) = Re
t′ [p + A(t′′)]dt′′ at t′ = t0 + iti.
The ﬁnal Coulomb-modiﬁed drift momentum is obtained
R
with

pf = ˙r(p, t → ∞),

(8)

with the amplitude F (pf , t0) ≡ F (p, t0). Accordingly,
the whole amplitude for photoelectron with the Coulomb-
corrected momentum pf in the present MSFA model can
be written as

c(pf ) ∝

Xs

F (pf , ts).

(9)

With considering the permanent dipole, the MSFA model
can also be applied to polar molecules [62].

D. Two-center interference in tunneling

Next, we discuss the form of the dipole term di(ks)
with ks = p + A(ts) in Eq.
(5) for the model
N2 molecule. With the linear combination of atomic-
orbitals-molecular-orbitals (LCAO-MO) approximations
[63] and assuming that the molecular axis is along the
z axis, the ground state wave function of N2 with 3σg
κrb .
symmetry can be written as hr|0i3σg ∼zae−
2Ip, za,b = z ± R/2 and ra,b = |r ± R/2|.
Here, κ =
Then the dipole di(ks) for N2, denoted with d3σg (ks) =
hks|r|0i3σg , can be written as [37]

κra − zbe−

p

d3σg (ks) ∝ N3σg [−2isin(

ks · R
2

)d2pz (ks)].

(10)

Here, R is the vector between these two nuclei of the
molecule and N3σg is the normalization factor. The term
sin(ks · R/2) describes the interference of the electronic
wave between these two atomic centers of the molecule,
and the term

d2pz (ks) = hks|r|0i2pz

(11)

is the atomic dipole moment from the 2pz orbit.

Clearly, according to Eq.

(4), for nonzero Ip, with
the complex solution ts = t0 + iti, the momentum ks =
p + A(ts) is complex, which characterizes the tunneling
process of the bound electron going through the laser-
Coulomb-formed barrier. For the elliptical laser ﬁeld, the
complex z and y components of the vector potential A(ts)
can be written as Az(y)(ts) = Ar,z(y)(ts) + iAi,z(y)(ts).
Then the complex momentum ks can be expressed as
ks = kr
s+iki
s = [pz+Ar,z(ts)]~ez+[py+Ar,y(ts)]~ey
and ki
s = Ai,z(ts)~ez + Ai,y(ts)~ey. Accordingly, the inter-
ference term sin(ks · R/2) has the following form

s with kr

sin(ks · R/2) = sin(kr

s · R/2 + iki

s · R/2).

synchronously with N2 at these angles. The case of Ar mea-
sured with N2 at θ = 0o is shown in (d). Other cases of Ar are
similar to that shown here. All of the results are normalized
to the whole amplitude of the corresponding distribution.

With assuming |pz +Ar,z(ts)| ∼ 0 and |py +Ar,y(ts)| ∼ 0,
as in [35], we have ks ≈ iki
s. By Eq. (4), we also have
|ki

s| ≈ κ. Accordingly, we have

sin(ks · R/2) ≈ sin(

iκR cos θI
2

).

(13)

Here, θI is the angle between the vector ki
s and the molec-
ular axis. A similar expression to Eq. (13) have been
used in [35] to analyze eﬀects of two-center interference
in ATI in orthogonal two-color laser ﬁelds. The approxi-
mate expression of Eq. (13) shows the interference of the
electronic wave in tunneling, characterized by the imag-
inary momentum “iki
s” with |ki
s| ≈ κ. The interference
eﬀect depends on the molecular alignment as the angle
θI is alignment dependent. On the whole, the value of
the term | sin( iκR cos θI
)|/2
increases with the increase of the internuclear distance R
and the decrease of the angle θI . For a linearly polar-
ized laser ﬁeld, we have θI = θ, and the above expression
clearly indicates that the ionization is the strongest at
θ = 0o and is near zero at θ = 90o. In the following, we
will show that the interference eﬀect inﬂuences remark-
ably on the PMD in the elliptical laser ﬁeld, especially
for the oﬀset angle.

Note, according to Eq. (5), the ATI from an atom with
a p-style orbital such as 2pz orbital, the wave function of
which is not spherically symmetric, also depends on the
angle between the laser polarization and the z axis of the
chosen coordinate system, since the term E(ts) · d2pz (ks)
is also angle dependent. However, in real experiments,
atoms can not be aligned and are randomly distributed,
so the ionization of atoms is considered to be alignment
independent. The laser intensity used in our experiments
is I∼2 × 1014W/cm2.
In our theoretical calculations,
we have used the laser parameters of I=2 × 1014W/cm2,
λ=800 nm and ε=0.8.

retical results are normalized to the whole amplitude of the

III. RESULT AND DISCUSSIONS

In our experimental studies for N2, we focus on three
typical alignment angles of θ = 0o, θ = 45o and θ = 90o.
However, the molecule can not be aligned fully in the
pump step. As a result, the measured PMD of N2 at
a certain alignment angle always contains the informa-
tion of other angles, making the PMD of the aligned
molecule somewhat similar to the randomly-distributed
atomic case. To highlight the comparison for PMDs of
N2 at diﬀerent angles, the PMDs of N2 aligned at a cer-
tain angle and Ar are measured at the same time, as
introduced in the method section. Then we evaluate the
diﬀerence between the normalized PMDs of N2 at the
angle θ and Ar.

In Fig. 2, we plot the measured PMDs of N2 at these
three typical angles and Ar. In each panel, the alignment
of the molecular sample relative to the main axis of the
laser ellipse is also reﬂected at the center of the distri-
bution by a dark line. All of the results are somewhat
similar, with the PMDs showing a small counterclock-
wise rotation relative to the axis of pz = 0. This rotation

 
 
has been attributed to the Coulomb eﬀect. For an atom,
this rotation disappears in the general SFA simulations
without considering the Coulomb eﬀect. However, the
situation changes for the diﬀerence of aligned N2 and Ar,
as shown in the ﬁrst row of Fig. 3. In contrast to Fig. 2,
the results diﬀer remarkably from each other here. When
both of the results of θ = 0o and 45o show an anticlock-
wise rotation structure for the bright part of the distri-
bution, with the brightest parts locating in the second
and the fourth quadrants, the result of 90o shows the
clockwise one, with the brightest parts in the ﬁrst and
the third quadrants. In addition, the oﬀset angle (which
is deﬁned as the angle between the axis of pz = 0 and the
axis which goes through the origin and the brightest part
of the PMD) for the result at θ = 45o is larger than that
at θ = 0o. These remarkable diﬀerences between diﬀer-
ent angles are in good agreement with the predictions of
TDSE and MSFA, as shown in the second and the third
rows of Fig. 3. They are also reproduced by the SFA,
as shown in the fourth row of Fig. 3, implying that the
Coulomb eﬀect plays a small role in these diﬀerences.

With the observations in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, we arrive
at the ﬁrst conclusion of the paper that imperfect align-
ment can play an important role in the PMDs of aligned
molecules measured in experiments, and to study dynam-
ical properties of ATI of molecules aligned at a speciﬁc
angle in experiments, the eﬀects of imperfect alignment
need to be minimized. The inﬂuence of imperfect align-
ment on PMDs arises from the fact that ionization yields
of molecules can diﬀer remarkably at diﬀerent alignment
angles. For example, for N2, the yields at θ = 00 are one
order of magnitude higher than those at θ = 900. As
a result, the main contributions to PMD in experiments
with imperfect alignment may not come from the aligned
sample. The alignment dependence of ionization of N2
has been discussed in detail in [27] with the MO-ADK
theory. It can also be understood with the interference
mechanism under the barrier in the frame of SFA, as dis-
cussed in Sec. II. D.

Next, we explore the potential mechanism for the
alignment-dependent phenomena in Fig. 3. In Fig. 4,
we plot the oﬀset angles of PMDs of N2 at diﬀerent
angles θ obtained with diﬀerent methods. The TDSE
result (the down-triangle curve) shows that the oﬀset
angle decreases with the increase of the alignment an-
gle. The experimental result (the star symbol) agrees
with the TDSE prediction. When the MSFA prediction
with the full dipole d3σg (ks) of Eq. (10) (the up-triangle
curve) also agrees with the TDSE one, the MSFA sim-
ulations with considering only the sin-type interference
term sin(ks · R/2) of Eq. (13) (the square curve) or only
the atomic dipole d2pz (ks) of Eq. (11) (the circle curve)
predict the similar tendency for the alignment-dependent
oﬀset angle, with showing a slower decrease of the oﬀset
angle for the increase of θ. When the result of MSFA
with only the interference term sin(ks · R/2) is somewhat
nearer to the full MSFA simulation with the molecular
dipole d3σg (ks) than that with only the atomic dipole

ments (star). Experimental results are abstracted from distri-
butions in the ﬁrst row of Fig. 3. The deﬁnition of the oﬀset

wise) rotation of the PMD, we deﬁne the oﬀset angle is minus
(plus).

d2pz (ks), we expect that the interference in tunneling
associated with the internuclear distance R plays a more
important role in this decrease than the contribution of
the atomic component d2pz .

With the above analyses, the angle dependence of
PMD of N2 can be understood with SFA. In Eq. (5),
the main contributions to the amplitude F (p, t0) come
from the interference term Eq. (13) and the real part of
the term eiS with S = a + ib. That is

F (p, t0) ∼ sin(

(14)

As the term θI is functions of both t0 and θ, the term b
is the function of only t0. Then we have

the maximal value when the time t0 is near to the peak
time of the main component Ez(t) of the elliptical laser
ﬁeld. The term Fb = | sin
| arrives at the
maximal value when the angle θI (t0, θ) is near to zero,
(cid:3)
and it has the minimal value of zero at θI (t0, θ) = 90o.
The interplay of these two terms Fa and Fb dominates the
maximal value of the photoelectron amplitude |F (p, t0)|.
For θ = 0o, the values of these two terms peak at the
same t0 corresponding to the drift momentum pz = 0.
However, for θ = 45o, they peak at diﬀerent t0. As a
result, the maximal value of |F (p, t0)| peaks at a certain
value t0 which is deviated from the peak time of Ez(t)
and is corresponding to the drift momentum with pz 6=
0. Accordingly, the absolute value of the oﬀset angle is

Figure 5: Distributions of transverse momentum of N2 at dif-
ferent angles θ and Ar, obtained with experiments (a), TDSE
(b), MSFA (c), SFA with considering the full dipole d3σg (ks)
of Eq. (10) (d), SFA with only considering the atomic dipole
d2pz (ks) of Eq. (11) (e). In (f), we show the direct compari-
son between the results of θ = 0o in (d) and (e). Experimental
results for aligned N2 are abstracted from distributions in the
ﬁrst row of Fig. 3 and those for Ar are from Fig. 2(d). TDSE
and model results for Ar are calculated with 1s initial state
to mimic the randomly-distributed Ar in experiments. All of
the results are normalized to the maximal amplitude of the
corresponding distribution.

larger for θ = 45o than for θ = 0o. Note, the Coulomb
eﬀect induces the rotation of the whole PMD, relative
to the description of SFA where the Coulomb eﬀect is
neglected, for both cases of these two alignment angles
and is not the main reason for the diﬀerence of the oﬀset
angles between them, as shown in Fig. 3. Generally, due
to the interference eﬀect, the maximum of the amplitude
|F (p, t0)| for aligned N2 prefers a trajectory (p, t0) at
which the angle θI is nearer to zero. For the reason, for
θ = 90o, it is the minor component Ey(t) of the elliptical
laser ﬁeld that dominates the ionization of N2. As a
result, the case of θ = 90o shows a larger absolute oﬀset
angle. We mention that in Fig. 4, the absolute value
of the experimental oﬀset angle at θ = 90o is somewhat
larger than the theoretical one. The reason may be that
the ionization signal of the system at the speciﬁc angle of
θ = 90o is weak and therefore the inﬂuence of imperfect
alignment can not be fully eliminated in obtaining Fig.
3(a3).

Besides the oﬀset angle, another characteristic quan-
tity which can be used to quantitatively study the inter-
ference eﬀect on PMD is the distribution of transverse
momentum, as shown in Fig. 5. Here, we plot rele-
vant distributions for N2 at these three typical angles
and for the reference atom, obtained with diﬀerent meth-
ods. First, the results of experiments, TDSE and MSFA,
shown in the ﬁrst row of Fig. 5, are similar. When the

6

distribution at θ = 0o shows a single-peak structure with
the position of the peak around pz = 0, the distribu-
tions at θ = 45o and 90o show the two-peaks one with
these two peaks appearing around pz = ±1. The distri-
bution for atom is similar to but somewhat wider than
that of θ = 0o. These main characteristics for angle de-
pendence of transverse-momentum distribution also ap-
pear in Fig. 5(d) of SFA simulations, implying that the
Coulomb eﬀect plays a small role here, in agreement with
our previous discussions. For SFA simulations with only
considering the atomic dipole of Eq. (11), the distribu-
tions at θ = 0o and θ = 45o are near to the atomic one,
as shown in Fig. 5(e). This phenomenon is in remark-
able disagreement with the SFA prediction of Eq. (10)
in Fig. 5(d), indicating the important contributions of
the interference term sin(ks · R/2) included in Eq. (10)
to the results in Fig. 5(d).

To highlight the interference eﬀect of Eq. (13) on the
distribution of transverse momentum, in Fig. 5(f), we
give a direct comparison of the results at θ = 0o in Fig.
5(d) with the interference term and Fig. 5(e) without
the interference term. One can observe that the distri-
bution with the interference term is narrower than that
obtained with neglecting the interference term in calcu-
lations. This phenomenon suggests that the interference
eﬀect under the barrier aﬀects remarkably on the distri-
bution of transverse momentum of the aligned molecule.
This is easy to understand. As discussed below Eq. (15),
the interference eﬀect will remarkably increase the am-
plitude of the brightest part of the PMD of the molecule
at θ = 0o, making the whole distribution of transverse
momentum of the molecule sharper in comparison with
the result without considering the interference eﬀect. As
a result, the relative width of the transverse-momentum
distribution for the molecule becomes narrower.

The above results support our another main conclusion
in the paper that the interference eﬀect under the barrier
plays an important role in alignment dependence of PMD
of N2 in elliptical laser ﬁelds.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have studied the alignment depen-
dence of ionization of N2 in strong elliptical laser ﬁelds
experimentally and theoretically. Due to that the ion-
ization yields of N2 diﬀer remarkably for diﬀerent align-
ment angles and perfect alignment is impossible in exper-
iments, photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs)
of aligned N2 measured in experiments can include a
great deal of information of imperfect alignment, which
will preclude a clear identiﬁcation of alignment depen-
dence of ATI of the molecule in elliptical laser ﬁelds.
With the synchronous measurement of aligned N2 and
Ar, we are able to highlight the alignment eﬀect on ATI
and minimize the eﬀect of imperfect alignment. When
the measured PMDs of N2 are not sensitive to the molec-
ular alignment, the diﬀerences between PMDs of aligned

 
 
 
N2 and Ar depend strongly on the alignment angle θ (the
angle between the molecular axis and the main axis of the
laser ellipse). This strong dependence is in good agree-
ment with predictions of TDSE and MSFA (a Coulomb-
modiﬁed semiclassical SFA model) where perfect align-
ment is assumed.

In particular, SFA simulations without considering
the Coulomb eﬀect also give a good description of this
strong dependence, suggesting that this strong depen-
dence arises mainly from quantum eﬀects associated with
the molecular properties in strong laser ﬁelds. With per-
forming analyses based on SFA, we show that the inter-
play of two-center interference (which is related to the
molecular bond length) and tunneling (which is related
to the electron motion under the laser-Coulomb-formed
barrier) plays an important role in the alignment depen-
dence of PMD of N2 in elliptical laser ﬁelds. Due to
this interplay, the oﬀset angle of PMD (which is closely
related to the most-probable emission angle of the photo-
electron) changes remarkably with the alignment angle.
For example, for θ = 00, the photoelectron of N2 prefers
to escape along the minor axis of the laser ellipse, while
for θ = 900, the main axis of the laser ellipse is preferred.
When the oﬀset angle of PMD is often used as a charac-
teristic quantity to deduce the temporal information of
the dynamical process of the target in attosecond mea-
surement, our results show that the molecular properties
already enter the oﬀset angle and need to be fully consid-

7

ered in future experimental study of attosecond probing
of aligned molecules based on photoelectron spectra.

Besides the oﬀset angle, this interplay also inﬂuences
remarkably on the distribution of transverse momentum
of aligned N2. For the typical case of θ = 0o, when the
interference eﬀect under the barrier remarkably increases
the ionization yields of the molecular system in compar-
ison with the reference atom with similar Ip and orbital
components to N2, it also induces the whole distribution
of transverse momentum of the molecule shaper than the
atomic one. As a result, the width of this distribution
for the molecule is narrower than the reference atom.

Our work suggests a manner for studying the align-
ment eﬀect on strong-ﬁeld ionization of molecules, which
is important in ultrafast measurement and control of elec-
tron motion inside molecules.
