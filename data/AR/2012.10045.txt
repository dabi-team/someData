Pinned solitons are a special class of nonlinear solutions created by a super-sonically moving object
in a ﬂuid. They move with the same velocity as the moving object and thereby remain pinned to
the object. A well known hydrodynamical phenomenon, they have been shown to exist in numerical
simulation studies but to date have not been observed experimentally in a plasma. In this paper
we report the ﬁrst experimental excitation of pinned solitons in a dusty (complex) plasma ﬂowing
over a charged obstacle. The experiments are performed in a Π shaped Dusty Plasma Experimental
(DPEx) device in which a dusty plasma is created in the background of a DC glow discharge Ar
plasma using micron sized kaolin dust particles. A biased copper wire creates a potential structure
that acts as a stationary charged object over which the dust ﬂuid is made to ﬂow at a highly
supersonic speed. Under appropriate conditions nonlinear stationary structures are observed in the
laboratory frame that correspond to pinned structures moving with the speed of the obstacle in the
frame of the moving ﬂuid. A systematic study is made of the propagation characteristics of these
solitons by carefully tuning the ﬂow velocity of the dust ﬂuid by changing the height of the potential
structure. It is found that the nature of the pinned solitons changes from a single humped one to
a multi-humped one and their amplitudes increase with an increase of the ﬂow velocity of the dust
ﬂuid. The experimental ﬁndings are then qualitatively compared with the numerical solutions of a
model forced Korteweg de Vries (fKdV) equation.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Solitons are a well known class of stable localized non-
linear structures that have been widely observed and
studied in a variety of natural and laboratory settings in-
cluding ocean waves[1], excitations in optical ﬁbres [2, 3]
and semiconductors [4, 5], plasmas systems[6–10], laser
plasma interactions [11–13], etc. A number of model non-
linear evolution equations that are known to be fully in-
tegrable yield soliton solutions. The Korteweg-de Vries
(KdV) equation [14–17] is one such nonlinear partial dif-
ferential equation that has been extensively employed
as a model to study low frequency nonlinear wave phe-
nomena in a plasma under conditions of weak dispersion
and weak nonlinearity. The emergent non-linear self-
reinforcing wave packets that maintain their shape and
identity while propagating at a constant velocity over a
large distance are well represented by the exact mathe-
matical soliton solutions of the KdV equation. While the
KdV model works well for impulsive excitations of non-
linear pulses where the excitation source provides only an
initial perturbation, the model is inadequate to describe
experimental situations where the source continues to be
operational in a continuous manner. Such is the case
for example when a moving object continuously excites
waves in a ﬂuid medium. To model such a situation a
KdV equation with a driving term - the so called forced
KdV (fKdV) equation - has been adopted and used suc-
cessfully in the past to interpret nonlinear phenomena in
hydrodynamics e.g. to study nonlinear waves excited by
fast moving objects in water [18–21]. The fKdV model
yields some interesting and novel nonlinear solutions such

as precursor solitons that travel ahead of the moving ob-
ject at a speed faster than the object. These precur-
sors can be excited when the speed of the moving object
crosses the sound speed of the medium. The fKdV model
also yields another class of soliton solutions that travel at
the same speed as the moving object and remain pinned
to the object as an envelope structure. These pinned soli-
tons can be excited at a much higher speed of the object
than what is required for the precursor solitons.

Precursor solitons in a plasma were recently observed
for the ﬁrst time under controlled laboratory conditions
by ﬂowing a dust ﬂuid supersonically over a station-
ary charged object [22].
In a frame where the ﬂuid is
stationary and the object is moving, the solitons were
shown to propagate in the upstream direction as precur-
sors while linear wake structures were seen to propagate
in the downstream direction [22]. In a subsequent exper-
iment, the propagation characteristics of these nonlinear
structures were shown to depend on the shape and size of
the charged object [23] over which the ﬂuid ﬂows. Exper-
imental observations of this fore-wake phenomenon were
well explained qualitatatively with the help of the forced
KdV model equation [22, 23].

While propagating precursor solitons in plasmas ap-
pear to be well established both experimentally and the-
oretically the topic of pinned solitons has so far not re-
ceived much attention. A detailed theoretical study on
them over a range of amplitudes, widths and the veloc-
ities of the moving charged object was carried out by
Tiwari et al.
[24] using extensive ﬂuid simulations. To
the best of our knowledge, there has yet been no experi-
mental study on pinned solitons in plasmas. Our present
work addresses that topic and we report on the ﬁrst suc-
cessful excitation of such structures in a dusty plasma
medium. A dusty plasma provides a convenient medium
to study wave phenomena since the massive dust parti-

 
 
 
 
 
 
cles suspended in the plasma medium can be easily vi-
sualized and their low frequency behavior captured in a
non-intrusive manner in a video recording. Our experi-
ments have been carried out in the DPEx device [25] that
has been successfully used in the past to study precursor
solitons [22, 23]. The major diﬀerence from past experi-
mental conditions is in the speed of the dust ﬂow which
is kept highly supersonic and in the ﬁne tuning of this
speed by careful control of the height of the potential bar-
rier created by a biased copper wire placed in the path
of the dust ﬂow. Our experiments show not only the ex-
istence of single humped pinned solitons enveloping the
moving source but also multi-humped solutions as pre-
dicted in the theoretical studies of Tiwari et al [24]. Our
present ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst experimental evidence
of the existence of these interesting nonlinear structures
and have the potential of stimulating further experimen-
tal and theoretical explorations in this area of nonlinear
physics.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND
PROCEDURE

FIG. 1: A schematic diagram of the dusty plasma experi-
mental (DPEx) setup. (b) A zoomed view of the tray shaped
grounded cathode showing the copper wire (connected with a
variable resistance) and two conﬁnement strips.

Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the Dusty
Plasma Experimental (DPEx) device in which the exper-
iments have been carried out. It is basically an inverted
Π shaped vacuum chamber consisting of a primary cylin-
drical glass tube which is radially attached with two sec-
ondary tubes. There are several radial and axial ports
connected with the primary as well secondary chambers

2

to serve various experimental needs. A disc shaped an-
ode suspended axially from the top of the left secondary
chamber and a tray type grounded cathode housed in
the primary chamber are used for the production of the
plasma. Two conﬁning potential strips are placed on the
cathode for conﬁning the dust particles in the axial direc-
tion whereas the bent sides of the cathode tray provide
radial conﬁnement. A more detailed description of the
device along with its associated diagnostics are available
in Ref.[25]. A biased copper wire of diameter 1 mm and
length 50 mm mounted radially on the cathode creates
a potential sheath around it which acts as a stationary
charged obstacle in the path of the dust ﬂow and leads
to the excitation of the pinned structures. The potential
of the wire can be varied between grounded to ﬂoating
by changing a variable resistor (ranging between 10 kΩ
– 10 MΩ) that is connected in series with the wire. The
variable bias changes the height of the potential barrier
and thereby the speed of the dust ﬂow. A DC power
supply (with a range of 0-1 kV and 0-500 mA) is used to
strike a discharge between the electrodes. Micron sized
poly-dispersive particles of diameter ranging from 2 to 5
µm are sprinkled on the cathode in between the wire and
the right strip for producing a dusty plasma. The aver-
age mass of these micron sized dust particles is estimated
to be ∼ 8.6× 10−14 kg.

Initially, the chamber is pumped down to a base pres-
sure of 0.1 Pa by fully opening the gate valve attached at
the mouth of the pump. The working pressure is set to
9-15 Pa by closing the gate valve to 20 % and opening the
ﬂow meter attached to the gas port to 5-10 % as shown
in Fig. 1. An equilibrium pressure inside the chamber is
maintained through out the experiments by balancing the
pumping rate and the gas ﬂow rate. An Argon plasma is
formed between the electrodes by applying a voltage in
the range of 290 − 360 V and the plasma parameters are
measured using a single Langmuir probe and an emis-
sive probe over a range of discharge parameters. For the
present range of discharge conditions, the plasma den-
sity (ni) is in the range of ∼ 0.5-1.5 ×1015/m3 and the
electron temperature (Te) is found to be 2 − 5 eV. The
above parameters are consistent with past reported mea-
surements in similar DC glow discharge argon plasmas
by several researchers [26–30]. The proﬁles of plasma pa-
rameters over a wide range of discharge parameters are
the same as presented in Ref. [25].

To create a dusty plasma, an equilibrium pressure
P = 9 Pa is ﬁrst set and then the applied voltage is in-
creased to 400 V so that a high electric ﬁeld is created and
the particles sprinkled on the cathode get charged. These
particles acquire a negative charge in the plasma environ-
ment and form an equilibrium dust cloud by the balance
of electrostatic and gravitational forces. In the vertical
direction, the gravitational force pulls the particles in
the downward direction whereas the electrostatic force
(arising from the cathode sheath electric ﬁeld) pushes
the negatively charged particles in the upward direction.
When these two forces balance each other the particle

in the dust ﬂuid compared to past experimental values
of M (∼ 1.1 − 1.3) [22, 23].
In addition, as mentioned
above, we have performed our experiments at a pres-
sure of 9 pa which is comparatively lower than that of
the previous experiments (11–12 Pa) [33]. This leads to
a lower dust neutral collision frequency of about 9 s−1
[25, 34] which is half the value of 18 s−1 reported for ear-
lier experiments carried out on this device [33]. We have
chosen this lower dust neutral collisional regime so that
dissipation becomes less important thereby avoiding the
excitation of shock waves. The ion density and electron
temperature values, measured using a single Langmuir
probe, are found to be ni ∼ 0.5× 1015 /m3 and Te ∼5
eV. The dust density (nd) is approximately estimated
as ∼ 1011 /m3 from the high resolution camera images,
whereas the dust temperature (Td) is estimated by track-
ing the individual particles of the tail part of the dust
cloud for 100 consecutive frames using a super Particle
Identiﬁcation Tracking (sPIT) [35] code and comes out
to be Td ∼ 0.6-1.2 eV. The charge Qd ∼ 104e is estimated
from the Collision Enhanced Plasma Collection [31, 32]
(CEC) Model for the present set of discharge conditions.
With the help of plasma and dusty plasma parameters,
the dust acoustic speed is theoretically estimated to be
Cda ∼ 22-25 mm/sec. We have also conducted a separate
experiment to excite dust acoustic waves (DAW) in the
same experimental regime but in the absence of ﬂow to
independently determine the dust acoustic velocity. The
waves were excited by applying a small electrical pulse
to the wire [36]. The average phase velocity (Cda) was
obtained by tracking diﬀerent crests of DAWs over time.
For the range of discharge conditions of the present set of
experiments, the measured phase velocity comes out to
be Cda ∼ 20 mm/sec. This is in good agreement with the
theoretical estimation as discussed above and the earlier
measurements of Jaiswal et al. [36].

To investigate the propagation characteristics of the
nonlinear waves, a highly supersonic ﬂow of the dust ﬂuid
ranging from 30 mm/sec to 60 mm/sec (corresponding
to M=1.4 to 3) is initiated by altering the conﬁning po-
tential for a particular discharge condition, p=9 Pa and
V=300 V. The height of the potential hill is suddenly
reduced from grounded potential to an intermediate po-
tential (a potential which is less negative with respect to
the particles), which generates a ﬂow of the dust ﬂuid
from right to left as shown in Fig. 2(b). Within a few
ms, the dust particles attain a constant velocity due to
the neutral drag force [36, 37] and the magnitude of this
constant velocity is varied by changing the value of the
intermediate potential and it is found that the maximum
velocity is achieved when the wire is switched to ﬂoating
potential. The ﬂow velocity of the dust ﬂuid is estimated
using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique
[38]. It is worth mentioning that the same technique of
ﬂow generation was used by Jaiswal et al [22] to excite
precursor solitons in the upstream direction and wakes
in downstream direction. In their experiments the range
of ﬂuid ﬂow velocity was M = 1.0 − 1.2. In the present

levitates in the vertical direction. The outward repulsive
interactions among the negatively charged dust particles
in the horizontal direction are countered by the inward
repulsive force of the sheath electric ﬁeld of the cathode
edges in the radial direction and by that of the grounded
copper wire and the right strip in the axial direction.
The force balance in axial, radial, and vertical directions
provide the overall conﬁnement to create an equilibrium
dust cloud. At equilibrium, the dust particles only show
their thermal motion. The levitated particles are visu-
alised by shining a green laser light of thickness ∼ 1 mm
in the x − z plane and their dynamics is captured by a
fast CCD camera looking in the same plane. The voltage
is then reduced to 300 V at which a highly dense dust
cloud is seen in between the grounded wire and the right
conﬁning strip. Fig. 2(a) shows the y-z plane of the dust
ﬂuid, which is conﬁned in between the grounded wire
and the right strip. At this speciﬁc discharge condition,
the potential of the wire remains highly negative with
respect to the plasma (∼ 290 V) and ﬂoating (∼ 270 V)
potentials, whereas the surface potential of the dust as
predicted by the CEC model [31, 32] is ∼ −7 V with re-
spect to plasma potential. In other words, the potential
around the grounded wire becomes negative with respect
to the surface potential of the dust and as a result the
particles remain conﬁned in the potential well created by
the wire and the strip.

The present set of experiments have been carried out
at a discharge voltage of Vd = 300 V and a background
pressure of 9 Pa, which are lower as compared to the
past experiments on precursor solitons [22, 23]. For the
present discharge conditions, the particles levitate at a
height of 2.75 cm from the cathode, which is higher than
the (∼ 2.1 cm) height of the earlier experiments on the
excitation of precursor solitons [22, 23]. This allows us to
generate a higher supersonic ﬂow, M (vf /Cda) ∼ 1.4 − 3

camera is directly proportional to the dust density due
to the linear response of the camera [41, 42]. The
width (L) of the pinned soliton is measured from the
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the intensity
proﬁle of perturbed dust density. The experimental
data associated with the high amplitude essentially cor-
responds to an intense wave crest (indicative of stronger
nonlinearity ) as shown in Fig. 3, whereas the higher
width signiﬁes broadened structures. The amplitude (A),
width (L) and the parameter (AL2) for a typical single
humped nonlinear structure, measured over a number
of frames for which it remained stationary, was found
to be A ∼ 1.3310 ± 0.0649, L ∼ 0.8575 ± 0.0765 and
AL2 ∼ 0.9859 ± 0.0179. As is well known, the electro-
static single humped soliton is formed when there is an
exact balance of the nonlinear steepening of a wave with
the broadening associated with dispersion. As shown
theoretically [43, 44] and experimentally [8, 22, 40] in
the past, solitons with larger amplitude always propagate
with higher velocity and smaller width in such a manner
that the product of the amplitude and the square of the
width remains constant. To test this conservation prop-
erty, a slightly diﬀerent set of experiments was carried
out by lowering the ﬂuid ﬂow velocity to M ∼ 1.4 but
keeping the plasma parameters to be the same. The am-
plitude and width of the consequent excited single peaked
solitary structure were found to be A = 1.2721 ± 0.0265
and L = 0.8645 ± 0.0728 respectively giving a value of
AL2 ∼ 1.0997 ± 0.01581, which is very close to the value
obtained in the earlier set of experiments. The constancy
of AL2 provides further evidence that such a structure is
indeed a soliton [8, 10] - in this case a pinned soliton.

(c) Many pinned solitons along with the wakes. The yellow
dashed line represents the location of the charged object.

When the ﬂow velocity of the ﬂuid is increased further
to M = 2.1 and above, by changing the wire potential
under the same discharge conditions, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
change in the shape of the pinned soliton. As shown in
Fig. 4 a variety of multi-humped pinned structures ap-
pear for ﬂow velocities M=2.1, 2.5 and 3.0 respectively.
Figure 4(a)-(c) clearly shows that the number of humps
increases with an increase in the ﬂow velocity. The corre-
sponding intensity proﬁles of the structures of Fig. 4(a)-
(c) are plotted in Fig. 5(a)-(c). Fig. 5(a) shows the proﬁle
of a fully developed two humped pinned soliton that re-

experiments the ﬂuid velocity is kept higher than these
earlier values and the consequent excitations of nonlinear
structures studied.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The ﬂow technique discussed above is used to generate
a ﬂow in the dust ﬂuid with ﬂow velocities ranging from
M ∼ 1.4 − 3 along the axis of the chamber. The initial
experiments are carried out by adjusting the resistance
value in such a way that the ﬂow velocity of the dust
ﬂuid becomes M ∼ 1.5. Fig. 3(a) shows a snapshot of the
wave excitations occurring at this ﬂow velocity, whereas
Fig. 3(b) shows the axial proﬁle of density compression,
which is extracted from Fig. 3(a). We see a distinct one

not the physical dimension of the wire but the width of
the electrostatic sheath created by the potential of the
wire. The dashed line in Fig. 3 indicates the physical
location of the wire, whereas the actual charged object
(the sheath) extends approximately 1.5 cms on both sides
of the wire [23] as indicated by the red (solid) vertical
lines. The distance from the wire to the single soliton in
Fig. 3 is ∼ 0.8 mm; hence the soliton is located within
the sheath and remains stationary. However, within the
experimental errors, it is hard to ascertain whether it is
exactly at the center of the sheath.

For a quantitative analysis, the amplitude and the
width of these non-linear structures are calculated by
following a standard technique used in the past [8, 10,
39, 40]. The amplitude, A (deﬁned as nd
− 1, where nd
ndo
and ndo are the instantaneous and equilibrium dust den-
sities, respectively) is calculated from the average pixel
intensities of the images of perturbed (I) and equilib-
rium (I0) dust densities using the formula A = I
− 1.

mains stationary in the laboratory frame and Fig. 5(b)
shows the proﬁle for a similar four peaked pinned soliton.
It is to be noted that the two and four peaked structures
have a symmetric proﬁle around the wire. Interestingly,
in the case of M ∼ 3.0 (see Fig. 5(c)), the multi-humped
pinned soliton has an asymmetric structure with respect
to the wire with the peaks to the right having a higher
amplitude compared to the ones at the left. The charac-
teristics of the wakes however remain the same with the
increase of ﬂow velocity and are always found to propa-
gate in the direction of ﬂow or in the downstream direc-
tion in the frame of the ﬂuid.

The time evolution of a three peaked soliton (as cap-
tured from subsequent frames) for the case of M = 2.3 is
plotted in Fig. 6(a) where the high amplitude structures
in the ﬁgure represent the three peaked soliton whereas
the lower amplitude structures on the left are wakes.
Fig. 6(a) also shows that the soliton remains nearly sta-
tionary in its position in the laboratory frame of reference
like the stationary charged object. In the frame of the
ﬂuid, the charged object moves from left to right along
with the pinned soliton with the same velocity. The wake
structures however are not stationary and propagate in
the downstream direction as has been observed earlier in
the experiments of Jaiswal et al. [22] and also shown in
Fig. 6(b), which is a zoomed view of Fig. 6(a) with only
the wakes. To summarize, the highly supersonic ﬂuid
ﬂow over a stationary charged object excites non-linear
pinned solitons in the upstream direction which maintain
their shape and size in the course of time, whereas the
wakes propagate in the downstream direction.

To quantify the dependence of the amplitude on the
ﬂow velocity the maximum values of the amplitudes of
the solitons excited in the range of M=1.5 to 3 are plot-
ted against the Mach number in Fig. 7. It can be seen
that with an increase in M , the maximum amplitude
of the excited stationary structures increases. This is in
qualitative agreement with the scaling observed in earlier
ﬂuid simulation studies of pinned solitons [24].

FIG. 6: (a) Intensity proﬁle of a three humped pinned soliton
and wakes over time. The dashed lines show that the higher
amplitude soliton remains stationary in the laboratory frame,
whereas the wakes move along the ﬂow. The dotted line rep-
resents the location of the wire. (b) The zoomed view of a
portion of Fig. 6(a) clearly shows that the wakes move from
right to left.

For a further qualitative understanding of the exper-
imental results we have solved a model f-KdV equation
numerically with a Gaussian source term [45] and com-
pared the numerical results with our experimental obser-
vations. The f-KdV equation for a dusty plasma is given

where S2 represents the source term. nd1 is the perturbed
dust density normalized to the equilibrium density ndo
and ξ = (z − upht) is the coordinate in the wave frame
moving at phase velocity uph normalized to the dust
acoustic speed. The spatial coordinate z is normalized by
the dust Debye length (λD) whereas time (t) is normal-
ized by the inverse of dust plasma frequency (ωpd).The
coeﬃcient α = [δ2 + (3δ + σi)σi + 1
i )]/(δ − 1)2,
where δ and σ are the ratio of ion to electron density
and temperature, respectively. For our numerical inves-
tigations we have used the value of α to be 2 as per the
plasma parameters. A Gaussian source function is used
in the form S2(ξ + F t) = Bexp(−(ξ + F t)/G)2) where, B
and G are the amplitude and width of the source function
respectively and F = 1 − vd, with vd the velocity of the
source function with respect to the frame of ﬂuid. The
coeﬃcient α in the unforced part of the model equation is
associated with the nonlinear contribution arising from
the plasma properties. It is the balance of this contri-
bution with the dispersive term that produces the stan-
dard KdV soliton. As a result, the nature of the KdV
soliton does depend on the value of α. However in our
case since we are not altering the plasma conditions this
dependence remains unchanged. For our driven exper-
iment we are interested in the inﬂuence of the driving
amplitude (B) and width (G) of the source term as well
as its velocity on the nature of the pinned solitons. In
general all these three quantities inﬂuence the propaga-
tion properties of the emitted soliton. An exact analytic
form of such a dependence is not known except for very
special forms of the driving term (e.g. a sech2 driving
term gives rise to a sech2 soliton as discussed in Ref.

[45]). For the Gaussian shaped source we have numeri-
cally explored various values of the amplitude, width and
velocity to investigate the excitation of single peaked and
multi-peaked pinned solitons. One guiding factor is that
the area of the Gaussian should be suﬃcient to produce
a soliton. The additional amount is radiated away.

In our experiments the sheath around the wire plays
the role of the charged object S2. This wire was also used
for the successful excitation of precursor solitons in our
earlier experiments [22, 23]. The knowledge of the shape
and size of the sheath potential from our earlier experi-
mental measurements [46] indicates that it is close to a
Gaussian shape. This has prompted our choice for the
form of the source function S2 for the numerical solution
of the f-KdV equation. The pinned solitons are numeri-
cally obtained by solving Eq. 1 for a Gaussian source with
B = 2.0, G = 2.0 that is made to move with vd = 1.5 in
accordance with the experimental condition of M = 1.5.
The snap shots of S2 and the normalized perturbed
dust density nd/ndo are shown in the left panel of
Fig. 8(a)-(d) for t = 6, 12, 18, 24, respectively. The red
dashed lines in Fig. 8 represents the position of the
charged object that moves with supersonic velocity in
the ﬂuid frame. The blue solid lines represent the nu-
merical solution of the fKdV. As can be seen, similar
to the experimental results (see Figure 3(b)), a single
peaked structure representing a single humped pinned
soliton is created near the source and remains stationary
with respect to it. The structures to the left of the ob-
ject consisting of wakes are seen to travel to the left. The
slightly oscillating - decaying behaviour of the excitation
observed in the left panel Fig. 8 is a consequence of the

(i)(ii)structure trying to settle down to a soliton state by ra-
diating waves. The right panel of Fig. 8 (a)-(d) shows
snapshots of a three peaked structure for t =17, 20, 23,
24, respectively as it settles down to a quasi-stationary
state for a Gaussian source with B = 4, G = 8 and
vd = 2.0. We have also numerically investigated the con-
servation property (AL2) by looking at the single peak
structure solutions of diﬀerent amplitudes in the forced
KdV model. For this investigation, the values of vd were
changed between 1.1 to 1.5 (see Table-I) for a given val-
ues of B = 2 and G = 2. Table-I shows that over a range
of the ﬂow velocity (vd), the solitons get excited with
diﬀerent values of amplitudes (A) and widths (L) but
the value of the solitonic parameter AL2 remains nearly
constant as also seen in the case of experiments.

1.1 1.354 ± 0.028 3.18 ± 0.05 13.67 ± 0.71
1.2 1.512 ± 0.045 3.09 ± 0.06 14.48 ± 0.99
1.3 1.816 ± 0.027 2.71 ± 0.05 13.35 ± 0.69

For further comparisons with the experiment, Eq. 1 is
solved for diﬀerent values of the amplitude, width and
speed vd of the source term to investigate the dependence
of the nature of the pinned solitons on the source param-
eters. In the experiments the change in the velocity of
the source is brought about by a change in the amplitude
and width of the source e.g. the velocity of the source
function was increased by increasing its amplitude which
in turn increased the width. Keeping that in mind we
have changed the amplitude, width and the velocity vd
in the source and then solved the f-KdV equation. The
results are shown in Fig 9(a-c) for source parameters with
B = 2, 4, 6, G = 2, 8, 20 and vd = 1.5, 2.0, 2.2 respectively
at t = 24. The solid lines correspond to the stationary
structures excited by the moving source and the dashed
line indicates the position of the source. Similar to the
experiments, it can be seen that with an increase in the
velocity (vd) of the source function, the number of peaks
of the excited pinned solitons increases as does the value
of the maximum amplitude. This is once again in quali-
tative agreement with the ﬂuid simulation results of [24]
where it was found that the amplitude as well as the
number of modulation peaks of the excited pinned soli-
tons increased with an increase in the source velocity
and amplitude. The scaling of the density compression
with velocity from our numerical solutions is plotted in
Fig. 10. Similar to the experimental ﬁndings (see Fig. 7),
the density compression increases almost linearly with
the increase of ﬂow velocity.

V. CONCLUSIONS

To conclude, experimental observations of a new class
of stationary solitons, known as pinned solitons, is re-

ported in a ﬂowing complex plasma. These experiments
have been performed in the Dusty Plasma Experimental
Device in which a large dust cloud was created in a DC
glow discharge Argon plasma. For the purpose of gener-
ating a highly supersonic ﬂow in the dust ﬂuid, the dis-
charge voltage and the background pressure were set such
that the dust particles levitated at a height far above the
cathode. The ﬂow in the dust ﬂuid was generated over
the stationary charged object by changing the height of
the potential hill used for the axial conﬁnement. The
highly supersonic ﬂow of dust ﬂuid was seen to generate

the wire. In the frame of the moving ﬂuid, these struc-
tures remain attached to the moving object (wire) and
constitute propagating pinned solitons. The maximum
amplitude of the solitonic structures was found to dis-
play an increase with the increase of the ﬂuid ﬂow veloc-
ity. In addition, the number of amplitude modulations
(peaks) in the density perturbation was also found to in-
crease with the increase in the dust ﬂow velocity. The
results are in qualitative agreement with numerical solu-
tions of the forced-KdV equation with a Gaussian source
function moving with a supersonic velocity. It must be
remarked here that the f-KdV model as well as the previ-
ous ﬂuid simulations [24] are based on a one dimensional
approximation of the dynamics and hence have inherent
limitations. They ignore, for example, eﬀects associated
with ﬁnite length eﬀects in the direction transverse to the
direction of propagation of the soliton that can lead to
bending or curving of the soliton proﬁles that would show
up in an experiment carried out in a ﬁnite device. Hence
the model results can only serve as a qualitative guide for
the interpretation of the results. However, as we see in
the present experiment and as has also been observed in
past experimental studies of solitons in laboratory plasma
devices [22, 23, 29], a KdV based model does capture the
essential features of soliton excitation and its propagation
characteristics. In the present case we are able to quali-
tatively establish the predominant features of the pinned

8

solitons by their stationary nature, the constancy of the
quantity AL2 for the one-humped structure and the ex-
istence of multi-humped forms predicted by the model.
So it appears that higher dimensional eﬀects may not be
important for our experiment. Our present results apart
from being of fundamental importance may have some
potential applications in real life situations. The experi-
mental conditions in the Earth’s bow shock region with
a supersonic solar wind impinging on a charged Earth is
similar in conﬁguration to our experimental set up. Like-
wise in the Earth’s ionosphere objects like space craft and
space debris get naturally charged from the ionospheric
plasma and can have similar associated nonlinear exci-
tations. The possibility of such excitations have already
been discussed in the literature [45] and recognized for
their utility [47]. It is hoped that such potential applica-
tions as well as the intrinsic importance of this nonlinear
phenomenon can stimulate further explorations on this
topic.
