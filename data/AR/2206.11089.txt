We report on a two-fold increase of the 39Ar loading rate in an atom trap by enhancing the
generation of metastable atoms in a discharge source. Additional atoms in the metastable 1s5 level
(Paschen notation) are obtained via optically pumping both the 1s4 − 2p6 transition at 801 nm
and the 1s2 − 2p6 transition at 923 nm. By solving the master equation for the corresponding
six-level system, we identify these two transitions to be the most suitable ones and encounter a
transfer process between 1s2 and 1s4 when pumping both transitions simultaneously. We calculate
the previously unknown frequency shifts of the two transitions in 39Ar and conﬁrm the results with
trap loading measurements. The demonstrated increase in the loading rate enables a corresponding
decrease in the required sample size, uncertainty and measurement time for 39Ar dating, a signiﬁcant
improvement for applications such as dating of ocean water and alpine ice cores.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The noble gas radioisotope 39Ar with a half-life of
268 ± 8 years [1, 2] has long been identiﬁed as an ideal
dating isotope for water and ice in the age range 50-
1800 years due to its chemical inertness and uniform dis-
tribution in the atmosphere [3, 4]. However, its extremely
low isotopic abundances of 10−17 − 10−15 in the environ-
ment have posed a major challenge in the analysis of
39Ar.
In the past, it could only be measured by Low-
Level Counting, which requires several tons of water or
ice [5].

In recent years, the sample size for 39Ar dating has
been drastically reduced by the emerging method Atom
Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA), which detects individual
atoms via their ﬂuorescence in a magneto-optical trap
(MOT). This laser-based technique was originally devel-
oped for 81Kr and 85Kr [6–9] and has later been adapted
to 39Ar, realizing dating of groundwater, ocean water
and glacier ice [10–13]. The latest state-of-the-art system
reaches an 39Ar loading rate of ∼10 atoms/h for mod-
ern samples and an 39Ar background of ∼0.1 atoms/h
[14, 15]. Still, its use in applications like ocean circula-
tion studies and dating of alpine glaciers is hampered by
the low count rate, which determines the measurement
time, precision and sample size.

Laser cooling and trapping of argon atoms in the
ground level is not feasible due to the lack of suitable
lasers at the required vacuum ultra violet (VUV) wave-
length. As it is the case for all noble gas elements, ar-
gon atoms need to be excited to the metastable level 1s5
where the 1s5 − 2p9 cycling transition at 811 nm can be
employed for laser cooling and trapping (Paschen nota-
tion [16] is used here, the corresponding levels in Racah

notation [17] can be found in Fig. 7 in Appendix A).
The 1s5 level is ∼10 eV above the ground level and, in
operational ATTA instruments, is populated by electron-
impact excitation in a RF-driven discharge with an eﬃ-
ciency of only 10−4 − 10−3.
Increasing this eﬃciency
would raise the loading rate of 39Ar accordingly.

Since the discharge excites atoms into not only the
metastable 1s5 but also many other excited levels, the
metastable 1s5 population can be enhanced by trans-
ferring atoms from these other excited levels to the
metastable 1s5 via optical pumping (Fig. 1). This mech-
anism has been demonstrated in a spectroscopy cell for
argon with an increase of 81% [18, 19] and for xenon with
an increase by a factor of 11 [20, 21]. It has also been
observed in an argon beam with an increase of 21% [18].
While these experiments were done on stable and abun-
dant isotopes, a 60 % increase in loading rate has recently
been observed for the rare isotopes 81Kr and 85Kr [22].
In this work, we theoretically and experimentally ex-
amine the enhancement of metastable production by op-
tical pumping for the rare 39Ar as well as the abun-
dant argon isotopes. We identify the 1s4 − 2p6 transi-
tion at 801 nm and the 1s2 − 2p6 transition at 923 nm
as the most suitable candidates. Implementing the en-
hancement scheme for 39Ar on these transitions requires
knowing the respective frequency shifts, which we calcu-
late and experimentally conﬁrm. Moreover, loading rate
measurements support the theoretically predicted trans-
fer process between 1s2 and 1s4 levels when driving the
923-nm and 801-nm transitions simultaneously.

A. Transfer eﬃciency

We solve the Lindblad master equation (see details in
Appendix B) for the 6-level system shown in Fig. 1(a)
which corresponds to the even argon isotopes without
hyperﬁne structure. The resulting steady-state solution

level can be obtained analytically as a function of the ini-
tial populations in |2(cid:105) and |3(cid:105), using the initial condition

(cid:101)ρij(t = 0) = 0 for (i, j) (cid:54)= (2, 2) and (i, j) (cid:54)= (3, 3). (1)

If only one transition is driven, e.g. Ω34 = 0, then
(cid:101)ρ55(t → +∞) simpliﬁes to the expressions given in [22].
We use these expressions to calculate the transfer eﬃ-
ciency (cid:101)ρ55(t → +∞) for the diﬀerent 1s − 2p transi-
tions in even argon isotopes as a function of laser power.
The transitions with the highest transfer eﬃciencies are
shown in Table I (see Table III in Appendix C for all
transitions).

ciencies from each 1s level, calculated for a laser beam

laser beam is assumed.

From the metastable level 1s3 (see Fig. 7 in Appendix
C), the 1s3 − 2p10 transition at 1047 nm has the highest
transfer eﬃciency of 77 %. Since 1s3 is also metastable,
only a few mW of laser power are needed to saturate the
transition. However, experimentally we only achieve an

increase in the metastable 1s5 population of ∼10 % by
pumping this transition. Since the increase in the popu-
lation of the metastable 1s5 is the product of the transfer
eﬃciency (=0.77, Table I) and the initial population in
the 1s3, it follows that the latter is only 10%/0.77 = 13%
of that in the metastable 1s5. Given this limitation, op-
tical pumping on 1s3 is not investigated further in this
work.

The transfer eﬃciency from 1s2 is the highest for the
923-nm transition to 2p6, reaching a high-power limit of
17 %. From 1s4 the transfer eﬃciency is the highest for
the 801-nm transition to 2p6, reaching a high-power limit
of 5 %. Since the populations of these levels in the ar-
gon discharge are not known, the actual increase in the
metastable population needs to be determined experi-
mentally. In the following we focus on these two transi-
tions as illustrated in Fig. 1(b) for the odd isotope 39Ar.

laser beams are sent into the source

frequency of 40Ar at rest as monitored in a spectroscopy cell.

Interestingly, when these two transitions are driven si-
multaneously (i.e. Ω24 (cid:54)= 0, Ω34 (cid:54)= 0) the ﬁnal population
in the metastable level ρ55 is smaller than the sum of the
individually driven transitions (see bottom row of table
I). This eﬀect is the consequence of stimulated emission
from 2p6 to 1s4 by the 801-nm light, together with the
923-nm light eﬀectively transferring atoms from 1s2 to
1s4. In the same way atoms are also transferred from 1s4
to 1s2. However, since the decay rate to the ground level
from 1s4 is three times higher than from 1s2 (see Fig. 7
in Appendix A), the total increase in the metastable level
is lower than the sum of the individually driven transi-
tions. As the laser power increases also the stimulated
emission increases, leading to a further decrease in the
combined transfer eﬃciency to the metastable level.

B.

Isotope shifts and hyperﬁne splittings for 39Ar

The total frequency shifts of 39Ar for the 801-nm and
923-nm transitions consist of the isotope shifts and the
hyperﬁne splittings. The hyperﬁne coeﬃcients of 39Ar for
1s2 and 1s4 were measured in [23], whereas for 2p6 they
can be calculated from the corresponding hyperﬁne coef-
ﬁcients measured for 37Ar [24], using the measured nu-
clear magnetic dipole moments and electric quadrupole
moments of 39Ar and 37Ar [22, 24–26]. The resulting
hyperﬁne coeﬃcients are shown in Table V in Appendix
D. Isotope shifts of neither the 801-nm transition nor
the 923-nm transition for any argon isotope have been
found in the literature. The isotope shifts for 36Ar and
38Ar have therefore been measured in this work (see be-
low), allowing us to calculate the isotope shifts for 39Ar
[22, 27, 28]. The resulting isotope shifts and hyperﬁne
splittings for 39Ar relative to 40Ar are given in Table VI

in Appendix D.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

For measuring the metastable population increase by
optical pumping in 39Ar as well as the stable argon iso-
topes, we use an ATTA system as described in [14].
Metastable argon atoms are generated in a RF-driven dis-
charge by electron impact (Fig. 2) and are subsequently
laser cooled and detected in a magneto-optical trap. Sin-
gle 39Ar atoms are detected via their 811-nm ﬂuorescence
in the MOT using an electron-multiplying charged cou-
pled device (EMCCD) camera. During a measurement
of 39Ar (39Ar/Ar=8 × 10−16 in modern air), the stable
and abundant 38Ar (38Ar/Ar=0.06 % in air) is measured
as well to account for drifts in the trap loading eﬃciency.
The loading rate of 38Ar for this normalization purpose
is measured by depopulating the MOT with a quenching
transition and detecting the emitted ﬂuorescence [7, 14].
For testing optical pumping on 38Ar and the other sta-
ble argon isotopes the loading rate is measured by ﬁrst
clearing the MOT with a quenching transition and then
the initial linear part of the rising slope of the MOT ﬂu-
orescence is measured [29].

For optical pumping, we shine in the 923 nm and
801 nm laser beams counter-propagating to the atomic
beam (Fig. 2). The laser beams are weakly focused
and slightly larger than the inner diameter of the source
tube (
10 mm). The optical pumping light is generated
by tapered ampliﬁers seeded with diode lasers, providing
up to 1.0 W of usable laser power at 801 nm and 1.6 W
at 923 nm. For measuring the diﬀerent argon isotopes,
the laser frequency needs to be tuned and stablilized
over several GHz. For this purpose, the two lasers are

partially removed so that 39Ar and 38Ar are enriched by
a factor ∼ 200. The ratio of 39Ar and 38Ar is not changed
in the enrichment process [33], which is important for the
normalization described above. The 40Ar, 36Ar and 38Ar
abundances in the enriched sample are 60 %, 30 % and
10 %, respectively.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The loading rate of the stable argon isotopes is mea-
sured versus the frequencies of the 801-nm and 923-nm
light (Fig. 3). A clear increase in the loading rate is
observed for all isotopes. For 40Ar we obtain most prob-
able Doppler shifts around −230 MHz in agreement with
the expected temperature of the liquid-nitrogen-cooled
atomic beam. The small 40Ar feature mirrored on the
positive detuning side is likely caused by the optical
pumping light reﬂected at the window behind the source.
The window is partially coated by metal which has been
sputtered by argon ions that are produced in the dis-
charge. From the observed resonances for 36Ar and 38Ar

we obtain the isotope shifts with respect to 40Ar for the
801-nm as well as the 923-nm transition shown in Table
IV. Based on these measured isotope shifts, we calculate
the isotope shifts for 39Ar (Table IV) using King plots
[27]. Interestingly, the loading rate of 36Ar shows a pro-
nounced increase also at the 40Ar resonance for both, the
801-nm and the 923-nm transition. Looking closely, an
increase in loading rate is visible for each isotope at the
resonances of the other two isotopes. This additional in-
crease is likely caused by metastable exchange collisions,
e.g. transferring an increase in the metastable popula-
tion of 40Ar to that of 36Ar. The maximum loading rate
gain is lower for 40Ar than for the less abundant 36Ar and
38Ar. This diﬀerence is discussed in more detail below.
Fig. 4 shows the 39Ar loading rate gain vs frequency
of the 801-nm and 923-nm light. For both transitions,
a clear increase in the loading rate is observed. For
923 nm, the F = 9/2 → 11/2 transition is the strongest
as expected from the multiplicity and transition strength
[34]. Moreover, the measurements conﬁrm the other cal-
culated hyperﬁne transitions. For 801 nm, the overlap
of the F = 9/2 → 11/2 and F = 7/2 → 7/2 transi-
tion is the strongest. The loading rate increase is lower
compared to that achieved with the 923-nm light. Ac-
cordingly, the diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions are resolved
less clearly. Nevertheless, the measurements are in good
agreement with the calculated hyperﬁne transitions. In
order to address not only one but two hyperﬁne levels of

measured with the enriched argon sample. The lines are saturation ﬁts according to the expressions given in [22].

39Ar, we add sidebands to the 801-nm and 923-nm light.
At 801 nm no increase is detectable by adding a side-
band resonant with the overlap of the F = 7/2 → 9/2
and F = 5/2 → 5/2 transitions. At 923 nm we observe
a maximum increase of only ∼10 %, although according
to Fig. 4(b) an increase of 40 % appears possible. Likely,
the increase by adding a sideband is compensated by the
decrease due to the lower laser power on the carrier fre-
quency.

The loading rate gain as a function of laser power is
shown in Fig. 5. As already observed in Fig. 3(a), the
maximum loading rate gain is lower for 40Ar than for the
less abundant 36Ar and 38Ar. This may be caused by the
higher density of 40Ar leading to a stronger trapping of
the 764 nm ﬂuorescence (see Fig. 1), which can quench
other metastable atoms. Moreover, the saturation inten-
sity is signiﬁcantly lower for 40Ar than for 36Ar and 38Ar.
This may also be caused by the higher density of 40Ar,
leading to trapping of the re-emitted 801-nm and 923-nm
light. The saturation intensity for 39Ar is diﬃcult to as-
sess due to the large measurement uncertainties and the
contribution from neighbouring hyperﬁne levels.

Table II lists the maximum loading rate gains of the
diﬀerent argon isotopes for the 801-nm and the 923-nm
transitions, as well as for both transitions driven to-
gether. As predicted by the calculation in section I A and
Appendix B, driving both transitions simultaneously re-
sults in a lower gain than the addition of the individual
gains. This result conﬁrms the transfer due to stimu-
lated emission between 1s2 and 1s4 via the intermediate
2p6, driven by the 923-nm and 801-nm light. For 39Ar a
two-fold gain in the loading rate is obtained by optical
pumping when simultaneously using 801-nm and 923-nm
light and addressing the F = 9/2 level. According to the

loading rate gain obtained for the other hyperﬁne levels
(Fig. 4), if sidebands are introduced with additional laser
power a near three-fold gain in the loading rate should
be possible.

As mentioned above and observed in Fig. 5, the load-
ing rate gain varies for diﬀerent isotopes. Moreover, we
observe that the loading rate gain depends on density
and sample composition. In order to examine the depen-
dence, we measure the 36Ar and 40Ar loading rate gains
vs. argon pressure in the chamber at the outlet of the
source tube (Fig. 6). In this measurement, atmospheric
argon (abundances of 40Ar, 36Ar and 38Ar are 99.6 %,
0.33 % and 0.06 %, respectively) is used instead of the
enriched sample. The loading rate gains of the two iso-
topes diﬀer signiﬁcantly. For 36Ar the loading rate gain
increases with the argon pressure whereas for 40Ar the
loading rate gain decreases beyond a maximum. More-
over, the loading rate gain for 36Ar in this measurement
with atmospheric argon reaches the value 3.3 whereas
it is only 2.2 when measured with the enriched sample
(36Ar abundance=30 %) as in Fig. 5. These ﬁndings
indicate that the populations of the 1s-levels in the dis-

photon excitation [35, 36]. For a more precise measure-
ment of the hyperﬁne coeﬃcients and the isotope shifts,
spectroscopy on samples highly enriched in 39Ar will be
necessary [37, 38].

The presented method for enhanced production of
metastable argon can be directly implemented in exist-
ing ATTA setups to increase the 39Ar loading rate by a
factor 2-3. For state-of-the-art ATTA systems, the 39Ar
loading rate is ∼10 atoms/h. For 39Ar analysis at a pre-
cision level of 5 %, this loading rate leads to a measur-
ing time of ∼50 h during which the 39Ar background in
the ATTA system increases linearly with time. There-
fore, the two-fold increase in 39Ar loading rate realized
in this work constitutes a signiﬁcant advance for measur-
ing time, precision and sample size of 39Ar analysis in
environmental applications such as dating of alpine ice
cores and large scale ocean surveys.

pendences might be caused by various mechanisms such
as trapping of light from the VUV ground level transi-
tions, which together with the optical pumping light can
produce metastable argon atoms.

IV. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have realized a two-fold increase of the 39Ar load-
ing rate in an atom trap system via optical pumping in
the discharge source. A three-fold increase is expected by
adding sidebands with additional laser power that cover
all the hyperﬁne levels of 39Ar. Similarly, we obtain an
increase of the MOT loading rate by a factor 2-3 for the
stable argon isotopes 36Ar, 38Ar and 40Ar. We observe
that the loading rate gain varies for diﬀerent isotopes and
that it depends on the argon pressure in the discharge
as well as the abundance of the respective isotope. We
assign these dependences to the complex population dy-
namics of the 1s-levels in the discharge via mechanisms
such as radiation trapping and metastable exchange col-
lisions. Consequently, using the method presented here
for practical 39Ar analysis requires a stable control of
the pressure so that the loading rate gain due to optical
pumping for both 39Ar and 38Ar stays constant during
measurements.

The hitherto unknown isotope shifts in 36Ar and 38Ar
as well as the 39Ar spectra for the 801-nm and 923-
nm transitions have been measured in this work. They
constitute an important contribution to the eﬀorts on
optically generating metastable argon via resonant two-

in Fig. 1. As described in section I A, |1(cid:105) is the ground
level and |5(cid:105) the metastable level for laser cooling and

to |5(cid:105) by driving the transition to |4(cid:105) followed by spon-

Appendix C: TRANSFER EFFICIENCIES FOR 1s–2p TRANSITIONS IN 40Ar

To determine the most suitable transitions for optical pumping to the metastable level 1s5, we have theoretically
investigated all the 1s−2p transitions in argon. The transfer eﬃciency for each transition has been calculated according
to the derivation in Sec. I A and the results are compiled in Table III. For each 1s level we can thereby identify the
transition with the highest transfer eﬃciency. Among these, we experimentally ﬁnd the 1s2 − 2p6 transition at 923 nm
and the 1s4 − 2p6 transition at 801 nm to be the strongest ones for optical pumping and therefore have chosen them
for this work. A scheme of all 1s − 2p transitions in argon is illustrated in Fig. 7 with the levels in Racah as well as
in Paschen notation.

Table III: Transfer eﬃciencies (cid:101)ρ55(t → +∞) for 1s − 2p transitions in 40Ar calculated for a laser beam with 9-mm
diameter and diﬀerent powers P . The transitions highlighted in bold are the ones with the highest transfer eﬃciency.
The levels are provided in Paschen as well as in Racah notation.

Appendix D: ISOTOPE, HYPERFINE, AND TOTAL FREQUENCY SHIFTS FOR THE 801-nm AND
923-nm TRANSITION IN 39Ar

Realizing optical pumping for the odd argon isotopes requires knowledge of the frequency shifts for the employed
801-nm and 923-nm transition. The total frequency shift is the sum of the isotope shift and the hyperﬁne shift. The
isotope shifts for 39Ar have not been measured and were calculated based on the measured isotope shifts for the stable
isotopes (see Sec. I B). The resulting isotope shifts for 36Ar, 38Ar and 39Ar are shown in Table IV. The hyperﬁne
constants of the involved levels have been measured for 39Ar or can be calculated from measurements for 37Ar (see
Sec. I B). The resulting hyperﬁne shifts for the diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels are compiled in Table VI together with the
isotope shifts and the total frequency shifts.
