ABSTRACT

The sheer interstellar abundance of helium makes any bound molecules or com-
plexes containing it of potential interest for astrophysical observation. This work uti-
lizes high-level and trusted quantum chemical techniques to predict the rotational,
vibrational, and rovibrational traits of HeHHe+, HeHNe+, and HeHAr+. The ﬁrst
two are shown to be strongly bound, while HeHAr+ is shown to be more of a van
der Waals complex of argonium with a helium atom. In any case, the formation of
+ is exothermic. HeHHe+ exhibits the
HeHHe+ through reactions of HeH+ with HeH3
quintessentially bright proton-shuttle motion present in all proton-bound complexes
in the 7.4 micron range making it a possible target for telescopic observation at the
mid-IR/far-IR crossover point and a possible tracer for the as-of-yet unobserved he-
lium hydride cation. Furthermore, a similar mode in HeHNe+ can be observed to the
blue of this close to 6.9 microns. The brightest mode of HeHAr+ is dimmed due the
reduced interaction of the helium atom with the central proton, but this fundamental
frequency can be found slightly to the red of the Ar−H stretch in the astrophysically
detected argonium cation.

INTRODUCTION

Helium and hydrogen make up nearly all of the observ-
able matter in the universe leaving chemists to squabble
over the remaining scraps. These scraps are what compose
the planets, our bodies, and most other things engineered
by human beings. Nearly all other processes depend upon
atoms much more interesting than the ﬁrst two on the pe-
riodic table. Even so, helium and hydrogen can engage in
chemistry with one another almost certainly combining to
make HeH+ (Hogness & Lunn 1925). This cation should
be produced in detectable amounts if for no other reason
than the sheer abundance of the constituents in the in-
terstellar medium (ISM) (Roberge & Dalgarno 1982). How-
ever, such an interstellar observation of this diatomic cation
has yet to be reported in the literature. It was the anal-
ogous ArH+ that has been observed toward various as-
tronomical sources(Barlow et al. 2013; Schilke et al. 2014;
Roueﬀ, Alekseyev & Bourlot 2014; Neufeld & Wolﬁre 2016)
making the argonium and not helonium (helium hydride)
cation the ﬁrst noble gas molecule detected in nature. The
smaller and more abundant helium and even neon hydride
cations have not been observed, yet.

The chemistry of helium is likely the least voluminous
for any of the elements between hydrogen and iron even in

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS

controlled laboratory conditions. However, helium will make
complexes and form some bonds. Helium cationic clusters
+ clusters have been synthe-
have been predicted, HemHn
sized, dication complexes observed, and even hydrogen-like
replacement structures analyzed (Frenking & Cremer 1990;
Roth, Dopfer & Maier 2001; Grandinetti 2004; Savic et al.
2015; Zicler et al. 2016). In all cases, the issue is that the
helium cation binding in any of these complexes is relatively
weak making long-lifetime molecules and high enough abun-
dances for observable interstellar spectra of such chemical
combinations quite unlikely.

Like unto helium, neon is reluctant to form bonds.
There is little surprise here due to the high ioniza-
tion potentials and relatively poor polarizabilities in these
smallest of noble gas compounds
(Taylor et al. 1989;
Rice et al. 1991; Pauzat & Ellinger 2005, 2007; Pauzat et al.
2009, 2013). Neonium (NeH+) has been well-characterized
(Ram, Bernath & Brault 1985; Matsushima et al. 1998;
Gamallo, Huarte-Larranaga & Gonz´alez 2013; Koner et al.
2016; Coxon & Hajigeorgiou 2016), but it has yet to be con-
clusively observed in any astrophysical environment. While
the reaction of Ar+ with ubiquitous hydrogen gas leads to
ArH+ and hydrogen atoms in the ISM, the analogous re-
action with neon will initially lead to neutral neon atoms

and ionized hydrogen gas (Theis, Morgan & Fortenberry
2015). More complicated neon structures beyond NeH+ have
been proposed and even synthesized, but few have bond
strengths in the covalent range (Frenking & Cremer 1990;
Grandinetti 2011). Notable exceptions include NeOH+ and
NeCCH+ recently characterized theoretically at high level
(Theis & Fortenberry 2016; Novak & Fortenberry 2017),
but these are several
factors less stable than their ar-
gon counterparts. With helium and neon being so very
abundant in the ISM, neon even more so than nitrogen
(Savage & Sembach 1996), molecules containing these atoms
may still be awaiting detection.

These molecules in waiting could be proton-bound
complexes. These structures involve a mostly bare proton
situated between two other atoms or molecules where the
mutual attraction of the ligands to the proton creates
fairly strong interactions. These structures are of additional
signiﬁcance to astrochemistry and astrophysical observation
due to their proton “rattle” or “shuttle” motion. In such
vibrational modes, basically only the proton moves. Hence,
little of the mass but nearly all of the charge is moving
creating an immense change in dipole moment. As a
result, such vibrational transitions are incredibly strong
absorbers/emitters meaning that small column densities of
materials are required to create observable spectral features.
OCHCO+, NNHNN+, and the heteromolecular combina-
tions have been analyzed recently showing that these
bright vibrational modes can be found from the near- to
(Terrill & Nesbitt
mid- and even far-IR wavelengths
2010; Cotton et al.
2015;
Yu et al.
2016b,a;
2015; Fortenberry, Lee & Francisco
Begum & Subramanian 2016) making them tantalizing
targets for the epoch for growth in IR telescopic power in
which we are currently in the midst.

Fortenberry et al.

Proton-bound complexes of noble gases have been
known for some time. In fact, the simplest, HeHHe+, was
noted for its relatively strong bonds nearly 35 years ago
(Dykstra 1983). However, a complete and reliable set of rovi-
brational spectroscopic data have yet to be produced for this
simple system while other insights into its nature have been
explored theoretically (Baccarelli, Gianturco & Schneider
1997; Panda & Sathyamurthy 2003; Bartl et al. 2013).
Other data for related noble gas molecules have been pro-
duced including those with helium (Fridgen & Parnis 1998;
Lundell, Pettersson & Rasanen 1999; Koner, Vats & Panda
2012; Koner et al. 2014; Borocci, Giordani & Grandinetti
2015; Grabowski et al. 2016; Koner et al. 2016), but full
spectral charactization is still lacking for most of these struc-
tures.

Very recently, the vibrational spectra of ArnH+ com-
plexes were characterized experimentally including ArHAr+
(McDonald II et al. 2016) with its bright proton motion at
10.11 microns with dissociation not occurring until 1.74 mi-
crons (or 0.711 eV). Simultaneously, theoretical work on this
complex produced a very similar dissociation energy (0.719
eV) and comparable vibrational frequencies (Fortenberry
2017). The NeHNe+ and NeHAr+ complexes were also an-
alyzed. Fortenberry (2017) showed that the NeHNe+ com-
plex is actually more strongly bound than ArHAr+ indi-
cating that, for once, the neon bonds are actually stronger
than the more polarizable argon bonds in a cation. The
NeHNe+ dissociation is higher at 0.867 eV, but interstel-

lar synthesis of NeHNe+ is most likely in the gas phase
+. Again, the former has
from reactions of NeH+ with NeH3
yet to be observed, and the latter is only weakly bound
(Theis & Fortenberry 2015). ArHAr+ is also favorably cre-
+ where the former is, again,
ated from ArH+ and ArH3
known in the ISM and the latter is a viable interstel-
lar candidate (Pauzat & Ellinger 2005; Pauzat et al. 2013;
Theis & Fortenberry 2015). Additionally, ArHAr+ has a
much brighter and longer wavelength proton shuttle motion
making it more likely to be observed in the ISM (Fortenberry
2017).

complexes

Consequently,

the question lingers as

to whether
proton-bound complexes
involving the abundant he-
lium atom are viable interstellar detection candidates.
Furthermore, combinations of noble gas atoms in such
complexes with helium are known to be fairly stable
(Koner, Vats & Panda 2012; Grabowski et al. 2016) and
those with other noble gas atoms have been classi-
ﬁed at high-level with good comparison to experiment
(Fortenberry 2017). As a result, this work will employ
the same methodology as that utilized previously on
proton-bound
(Fortenberry, Lee & Francisco
2016a,b; Fortenberry 2017) where comparison in other
molecules to gas phase experimental results has provided
exceptional accuracy on the order of 0.01 micron accuracy
for vibrational features and 30 MHz for rotational constants
(Huang & Lee 2008, 2009; Huang, Taylor & Lee 2011;
Zhao, Doney & Linnartz 2014; Fortenberry et al. 2011a,b,
2012; Huang, Fortenberry & Lee 2013a,b; Fortenberry et al.
2013,
2015;
Kitchens & Fortenberry 2016; Fortenberry, Roueﬀ & Lee
2016). These data will be useful for the spectral char-
acterization of such molecules in the ISM with current
and upcoming ground- and space-based telescopes such as
the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope. Potentially
expanding the noble gas molecular budget of the ISM will
grow our understanding of interstellar chemical bonding
and provide novel chemical pathways for these so-called
“inert” and noble gases.

As a consequence of the diﬀerences in geometrical connec-
tivities and atomic symmetries, HeHHe+ requires the use of
57 total points, while HeHNe+ and HeHAr+ require 69 to
deﬁne the QFF.

At each displacement point, CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ,
-pVQZ, and -pV5Z energies are extrapolated to the com-
plete basis set (CBS) limit via a three-point formula
(Martin & Lee 1996) and augmented for inclusion of core
correlation from the MT basis sets as well as scalar relativ-
ity (Douglas & Kroll 1974). This produces the CcCR QFF
for “CBS,” “core correlation,” and “relativity.” The rela-
tivistic computations are made with the MOLPRO 2010.1
quantum chemistry package (Werner et al. 2010). A least-
squares ﬁtting of the points produces the equilibrium ge-
ometry, and reﬁtting the points produces zero gradients
and the subsequent force constants. The ﬁtting is tight
with a sum of squared residuals on the order of 10−17
a.u.2 for the Ne and Ar complexes and 10−18 a.u.2 for
HeHHe+. The force constants are transformed from the
symmetry-internal coordinates into more generic Cartesian
coordinates with the INTDER program (Allen & coworkers
2005). Then, second-order vibrational perturbation theory
(VPT2) and rotational perturbation theory are employed to
provide the frequencies and spectroscopic constants (Mills
1972; Watson 1977; Papousek & Aliev 1982) within the
SPECTRO program (Gaw et al. 1991). Double-harmonic in-
tensities are computed with the Gaussian09 program and
the MP2/6-31+G∗ level of theory (Møller & Plesset 1934;
Hehre, Ditchfeld & Pople 1972; Frisch et al. 2009) which
has been shown to provide notable agreement for the vi-
brational intensities of NNHNN+ with a more advanced
and time-consuming semi-global dipole moment surface
(Yu et al. 2015).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The interstellar presence for any of these proton-bound com-
plexes can be established by observing the necessary rota-
tional or vibrational transitions. However, the possible for-
mation of these species must be established in order for
such searches to be deemed even plausible before observa-
tion can begin. In light of such, high-level computations at

the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z level are performed here in or-
der to determine if these proton-bound complexes can form
exothermically in the gas-phase. Similar and previous anal-
ysis (Fortenberry 2017) shows that ArHAr+ is a likely inter-
stellar proton-bound complex created from the reaction of
+. Table 1 contains these data for HeHHe+,
ArH+ with ArH3
HeHNe+, and HeHAr+ in the standard chemistry unit of
kcal/mol as well as in eV. The complexes lie to the right
of the reaction arrow indicating that negative energies are
desirously exothermic in the gas phase.

HeHHe+ is thermodynamically stable since removal of
a single helium atom has a 0.57 eV energy cost. Removal
of both helium atoms is over ﬁve times higher in energy.
The collision of two helium hydride cations will not form
HeHHe+ and a hydrogen atom. However and like with
ArHAr+, the reaction of helium hydride with helium trihy-
dride produces HeHHe+ with an excess of 0.52 eV of energy.
+ is a matter of further discussion,
The formation of HeH3
+ is stable requiring a small but non-negligible
but HeH3
amount of energy to dissociate the helium atom.

HeHNe+ is also thermodynamically stable, but removal
of the helium atom (-0.52 eV) is nearly half as energetically
costly as removal of the neon atom at -0.95 eV. This is likely
actually the strongest neon bond produced thus far besides
neonium itself. The neon bonding in NeOH+ is -0.53 eV,

(Theis & Fortenberry 2015; Pauzat et al. 2013). Reacting
this specie with the almost guaranteed interstellar HeH+
produces HeHAr+ and -1.73 eV of energy.

+ has the strongest Ng

Hence, HeHAr+ is the most energetically-favored prod-
uct, but interstellar abundances still point to HeHHe+ as the
most likely to be observed. In any case, only spectroscopic
observation in the ISM can determine the presence for any
of these compounds. The following data for each complex
should be able to assist in the laboratory or even interstel-
lar observation of these noble gas, molecular cations.

3.1 HeHHe+

The force constants, those needed to construct the QFF po-
tential within the Hamiltonian, for the proton-bound, he-
lium cation dimer are given in Table 2. The harmonic, di-
agonal force constants can be viewed as proportional to
bond strength. Breaking these symmetry-internal coordi-
nates (from Eqs. 1-4) down into simple-internal coordi-
H coordinates, produces a 2.165 mdyne/˚A2
nates, i.e. He
−
force constant for the He
H stretch. This is is nearly
−
identical to the 2.158 mydne/˚A2 Ne
H force constant in
NeHNe+ and greater than that in ArHAr+ (Fortenberry
2017). This is greater even than the force constant in
NeOH+ (Theis & Fortenberry 2016). Consequently, the no-
table bond energy discussed previously for the removal of the
helium atom from HeHHe+ is corroborated by the internal
molecular structure, as well.

−

−

−

Further corroboration comes from the He

H bond
length given in Table 3. This value is 0.946 ˚A, which is
0.17 ˚A longer than the same bond in the helium hydride
cation. However, the He
H bond length is still signiﬁcantly
less than bond lengths in helium van der Waals complexes
which often approach 3 ˚A. The rotational constants are also
given even though HeHHe+ possesses no permanent dipole
moment. The distortion constants are fairly large since the
molecule has a fairly small mass and a labile proton. On the
other hand, the vibrationally-excited rotational constants
(Bν), notably B1 and B2, can be utilized for rovibrational
spectral modeling.

Furthermore, the vibrational intensities indicate that
the proton-shuttle motion will be have a large transition mo-
ment/be a strong absorber or emitter as would be expected
for such a complex. The double-harmonic 2661 km/mol in-
tensity for ω1 is nearly the same as NeHNe+ and roughly
half that of ArHAr+ which are all two orders of magnitude
greater than most vibrational intensities. The anharmonic
shuttle motion, ν1, lies at 1345.2 cm−1 or 7.43 microns at
the red end of the mid-IR. Deuteration drops this value into
the far-IR at 1030.8 cm−1 or 9.70 microns. Inclusion of the
lighter 3He isotope blueshifts the frequencies slightly for each
inclusion. The ν2 bending mode also has a notable inten-

sity and is actually quite bright relative to more traditional
vibrational modes. The anharmonic frequency for the bend
(or perpendicular proton motion) is 884.9 cm−1 or 11.30 mi-
crons. The two-quanta combination bands and overtones are
also given in Table 3. Those modes containing ν1 will also be
bright as has been shown for ArHAr+ (McDonald II et al.
2016).

3.2 HeHNe+

−

−

The HeHNe+ force constants are given in Table 4. Immedi-
ately, the He
H F11 force constant shows weakening in this
bond upon inclusion of the neon atom. However, the F22
H force constant is quite close to that in NeHNe+ and
Ne
actually is even greater by a small margin corroborating the
energetic data from Table 1. The He
H bond length conse-
quently grows to 0.977 ˚A in HeHNe+ relative to the helium
H bond length is small at 1.124 ˚A, as
dimer, and the Ne
shown in Table 5. This is shorter than the 1.156 ˚A Ne
H
bond length in NeHNe+ (Fortenberry 2017).

−

HeHNe+ is rotationally active and has a large dipole
moment of 3.10 D computed with the center-of-mass at the
origin from CCSD/aug-cc-pVTZ. The dipole moment and
subsequent rotational constants provided in Table 5 will as-
sist in pointing closely towards the placement for the ro-
tational lines of this linear complex. Isotopic substitution
with 3He actually has more of an eﬀect than D in this case
since the helium atoms are on the outside of the molecule
and the hydrogen is closer to the center-of-mass. Again, the
vibrationally-excited rotational lines are also given in Ta-
ble 5 in order to provide complete rovibrational analysis of
HeHNe+. The magnitudes of the distortion constants are not
as large in this complex as they are in HeHHe+, and scale,
at least for De, with the mass of neon relative to helium.

The ω1 proton-shuttle motion in HeHNe+ has a sim-
ilar intensity at 2610 km/mol (Table 5) as HeHHe+ and
NeHNe+. The ω3 stretch can be classiﬁed as both the Ne
and He atoms moving away from the proton, but the lighter
He atom has a larger vector leading to the qualitative de-
scription of this state as the He
H stretch. This fundamen-
tal will also be visible, but the change in dipole moment is
quite small creating only a 15 km/mol intensity. The bend
intensity is also in the same range as the bending frequency
intensities in HeHHe+ and NeHNe+.

−

Replacement with the neon atom to create HeHNe+ ac-
tually blue-shifts the bright ν1 fundamental vibrational fre-
quency to 1453.6 cm−1 (6.88 microns) relative to the bright
mode in HeHHe+. The other two modes red-shift as one
would expect for vibrational frequencies involving a heavier
atom, neon in this case. The reason for this likely lies in
the non-zero, by symmetry, F21 mixed harmonic force con-
stant that is forbidden in HeHHe+. This additional overlap
is quite large at 1.169 mdyne/˚A2 from Table 4 and allows the
two stretches to couple further since more symmetry-allowed
avenues are opened. Consequently, the total interatomic in-
teraction increases in the proton-sharing for HeHNe+. The
ν3 stretch in HeHNe+ is further red-shifted relative to the
helium proton-bound dimer since the He
H F11 force con-
stant is computed here to be signiﬁcantly reduced in the
CcCR QFF VPT2 computations.

does the ν2 bend with shifts of 106.1 cm−1 and 9.1 cm−1, re-
spectively. Inclusion of 22Ne aﬀects the frequencies, as well,
but the shift in relative mass is less obtrusive for this atom
making its isotopic shifts far less than those for D and 3He.

3.3 HeHAr+

As the previously discussed energetics indicate, the be-
havior of HeHAr+ is quite diﬀerent from the other two
proton-bound complexes described in this work and also
H force constant in HeHAr+
from NeHNe+. The F11 He
−
is quite small at 0.105 mdyne/˚A2 in Table 6. The F22
H force constant is quite large at 4.011 mdyne/˚A2,
Ar
nearly the same magnitude as that in argonium itself
(Theis, Morgan & Fortenberry 2015). Table 7 corroborates
H bond-
the strong Ar
ing in the bond lengths themselves. The 1.558 ˚A He
H
bond length is much longer than any in the other two he-

H bonding and relatively weak He

lium proton-bound complexes, and the 1.276 ˚A Ar
H bond
length is quite close to the 1.292 ˚A bond length in argonium
(Cueto et al. 2014).

−

The longer bond lengths and the heavier argon mass
increase the rotational constants such that they are roughly
half as large as Bv in HeHNe+ which are roughly half-
again as large as Bv in HeHHe+. The center-of-mass-origin,
CCSD/aug-cc-pVTZ dipole moment for HeH40Ar+ is 1.48
D smaller than that in HeHNe+ making any rotational in-
tensities less for HeHAr+ than in the neon complex. The
more weakly bonded nature of HeHAr+ is also carried out
in increases of the quartic and sextic (De and He, respec-
tively) distortion constants. Both of these values are higher
for HeHAr+ relative to HeHNe+, and the -40.138 Hz He in
HeH36Ar+ is of greater magnitude than the same parameter
in HeHHe+. The bond lengths and the distortion constants,
as well as the energetics, show that the HeHAr+ proton-
bound complex is likely a strong van der Waals interaction
between the argonium cation and a helium atom and not a
covalent interaction on the helium end.

The intensities of the vibrational modes also belie a shift
in the physical construction of this complex. The proton-
shuttle motion is relatively dim (although still absolutely
bright) with an intensity of 703 km/mol. The bend and
H stretch are also less intense, but they do not drop
He
in value by as much of a percentage relative to HeHHe+ as
ω1. Similar behavior is reported for ArHNe+ (Fortenberry
2017) making these trends highly likely to be observed phys-
ically.

−

The ν1 proton shuttle motion now is actually more
correctly described as the Ar
H
stretching component coeﬃcient in deﬁning the potential

H stretch since the He

shuttle motion normal mode is small. The ν1 Ar
H stretch
in HeH36Ar+ is 2469.3 cm−1 (4.05 microns) which is fairly
H stretch in argonium at 2612.5 cm−1 (3.83
close to the Ar
microns) (Cueto et al. 2014). The frequency of the ν2 bend
and the ν3 He
H stretch drop signiﬁcantly relative to the
other complexes further highlighting the relative weakness of
the helium interactions with the argonium core. These two
far-IR transitions are only weakly aﬀected by the change in
argon mass, but, unexpectedly have a larger shift for inclu-
sion of the lighter 3He isotope as shown in Table 8. However,
the moderate intensity of the ν2 bend at 316.5 cm−1 (31.60
microns) makes this fundamental vibrational frequency a
tantalizing candidate for far-IR observation, especially for
the next generation of space telescopes currently within dis-
cussion of the presently ongoing decadal surveys.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The most striking result from this study in light of the ear-
lier work by Fortenberry (2017) is that neon and helium
behave very similarly while argon does not. The intensities,
fundamental vibrational frequencies, and even binding en-
ergies are not signiﬁcantly changed when moving down the
periodic table from helium to neon in such proton-bound
complexes. Once argon is invoked, the chemistry changes
fundamentally. This is likely due to the polarizability of ar-
gon and the energy proximity of the additional d orbitals
close to argon’s valence orbital occupation.

In any case, the proton-bound complexes involving he-
lium and neon (HeHHe+, HeHNe+, and NeHNe+) give very
intense proton shuttle motions in the range where the mid-
IR becomes the far-IR. The newest generation of space-
based telescopes like the upcoming James Webb Space Tele-
scope (JWST) or even the Stratospheric Observatory for
Infrared Spectroscopy can potentially be utilized to observe
these vibrational frequencies. The HeHNe+ dipole moment
is also large making this proton-bound complex a candi-
date for rotational observation with ground-based telescopes
as has been the common practice for half a century. The
HeHAr+ complex appears to be readily formed from hy-
pothesized interstellar species, the helonium and argon tri-
hydride cations. HeHAr+ is also rotationally active and has a
bright fundamental vibrational frequency, but both of these
are reduced relative to HeHNe+.

The sheer abundance of helium and hydrogen as well as
the relatively high abundance of neon make any molecules
comprised of these species notable for interstellar chemistry

and subsequent astrophysical observation. The relative ener-
getics, zero-point energies, and spectroscopic data provided
in this work will enhance further laboratory, modeling, or in-
terstellar studies. While estimates of the actual abundances
are beyond the scope of the present work, the formation en-
ergetics imply that the abundances of these proton-bound
complexes are likely dependent upon the abundances of
the possible precursors, notably the noble gas-hydride and
-trihydride cations. As a result, HeHAr+ will likely have
the highest abundance. However, the signiﬁcant intensities
present for the proton shuttle fundamental frequencies of the
helium and neon complexes should make relatively small
abundances for any of these noble gas species detectable
with JWST. Consequently, the present work is showing a
likely case where more, natural noble gas molecules may be
detected in the ISM and the chemistries of these atoms can
be further enhanced.

5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
