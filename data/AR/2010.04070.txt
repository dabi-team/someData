Can a crystal be the ground state of a Bose system?

It is usually assumed that the Bose crystal at T = 0 corresponds to the genuine ground

state of a Bose system, i.e., this state is non-degenerate and is described by the wave function

without nodes. By means of symmetry analysis we show that the ground state of a Bose system

of any density should correspond to a liquid or gas, but not to a crystal. The main point is

that any anisotropic state of a system of spinless bosons is degenerate. We prove this for an

inﬁnite three-dimensional (3D) system and a ﬁnite ball-shaped 3D system. One can expect

that it is true also for a ﬁnite system of any form. Therefore, the anisotropic state cannot

be the genuine ground state. Hence, a zero-temperature natural 3D crystal should correspond
to an excited state of a Bose system. The wave function Ψc
0 of a zero-temperature 3D Bose
crystal is proposed for zero boundary conditions. Apparently, such Ψc
0 corresponds to a local
minimum of energy (absolute minimum corresponds to a liquid). Those properties yield the
possibility of existence of superﬂuid liquid H2, Ne, Ar, and other inert elements. We propose
several possible experimental ways of obtaining them.

Keywords: Bose crystal; ground state; degeneracy; superﬂuidity.

Introduction

In the Nature, liquids usually crystallize at the cooling. This leads to the natural commonly

accepted assumption that the lowest state of a dense three-dimensional (3D) Bose system

corresponds to a crystal. However, we will see in what follows that this is apparently not the

case. The question about the structure of the ground state (GS) is of primary importance.

In a strange way, it has been little investigated in the literature. Below, we will try to clarify

this question mathematically (Sect. 2) and consider the possible experimental consequences

(Sect. 3).

In this regard, we mention the book by K. Mendelssohn [1], that provides an

excellent review of the history of the development of low-temperature physics till 1965.

In the literature, three solutions were proposed for the GS wave function (WF) Ψc
0 of a Bose
crystal. All of them correspond to WF without nodes. Thus, it was assumed that the crystal

at T = 0 corresponds to the genuine GS of the system. At ﬁrst the following localized ansatz

was considered (see works [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and reviews [9, 10, 11]):

Here, the sum including Sj describes the j-particle correlations. In ansatz (2), the crystal
lattice is postulated, and it is assumed that the atoms execute small oscillations near the
sites. The function ϕ(r) from (2) in the approximation of small oscillations is ϕ(r) = e−α2r2/2
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The simple analysis shows that, for such solution, no condensate of

atoms is present [10, 18, 19].

It is a translationally invariant anisotropic solution. We denote the anisotropy of function (7)
by a vector kr (this is the reciprocal lattice vector with the nonzero smallest components). It
is known that GS of a liquid or a gas is described by an isotropic WF (6), (4) [15, 16, 17, 37,

38, 39] (we consider the function (4) to be isotropic). It was assumed in a number of works
that, at some critical density ρ = ρc, the liquid solution (6), (4) spontaneously transforms
into a crystalline solution (6), (7) [33, 34, 35, 40].

Let us clarify which of functions (2), (5) and (6), (7) can be the solution for a crystal. In

order to verify the bulk structure of solutions, we can use any boundary conditions (BCs).

Let us test the crystal solutions (2), (5), and (6), (7) for periodic BCs. The periodic system

is translationally invariant, which yields two consequences. (i) The properties of a system on

a ring must not change at a rotation of the ring. This holds provided that, at a displacement
0, WF of the system is multiplied by a
of the system as a whole by the radius-vector δr
constant:

→

Ψ(r1 + δr, . . . , rN + δr) = (1 + ipδr)Ψ(r1, . . . , rN ) = eipδrΨ(r1, . . . , rN ).

(ii) Since

Therefore, the full collection of WFs Ψj(r1, . . . , rN ) of such a boundary-value problem can
be constructed so that each WF is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator ˆP, i.e., it
satisﬁes conditions (8) and (10). This is well known from quantum mechanics.

The most widely used ansatz is WF (2), where the coordinates of sites Rj are ﬁxed and

With regard for the anharmonic corrections to ϕ(r), the formula for ˆPΨc
0 is complicated, but
the conclusion does not change. More complicated modiﬁcation of WF (2) was proposed in

[41]. For it, relation (10) does not hold as well.

Solution (2) is impossible for periodic BCs also because the concentration of a periodic
Bose system is an exact constant: n(r) = const [31, 42, 43, 44]. This surprising property
is related to the translation invariance and can be easily proved (for any pure state with a

deﬁnite momentum, including the lowest state (T = 0), see the calculation of the density

matrix in the coordinate representation in [44] and in the operator approach in [31]; for
T > 0, this can be proved analogously to the analysis in [44], using the formula n(r) =
2 and property (8)). The constancy of the
const
density means that, in a periodic system, the crystalline ordering is hidden. It must manifest
itself in oscillations (with the period of a crystal) of the two-particle density matrix g2(r1, r2),
rather than in the density. But solution (2) corresponds exactly to the oscillating particle
density: n(r + b) = n(r), where bx, by, bz are the sizes of crystal cell. [Let us show it. Since
S0 in (3) and (4) correspond to a constant density, we set S0 = 0 in (2). Then we get
n(r) = ˜C
= const. On the other hand, n(r + b) = n(r), since the translation
of the crystal by one step is equivalent to the renumbering of sites, which does not change

0, if θ(rj) =

This equals ~pΨc
(see below). We get p = 0 at θ(rj) = const. Then ansatz (5) is reduced to the solution (6)
with S0 (4). However, it is a solution for WF of the ground state of a uniform and isotropic
system (liquid or gas) [15, 16, 17, 37, 38, 39].

It is important that WF of the ground state of a crystal (or liquid) with periodic BCs

must correspond to zero momentum: ~p = 0. The case p
crystal would contain a quasiparticle, then the momentum ~p
this quasiparticle. But the ground state contains no quasiparticles, and the crystal as a whole

= 0 is unphysical. Indeed, if the

does not move. Therefore, the separated direction that is set by nonzero momentum cannot
be associated with a physical property. In view of this, we have p = 0.

This can be shown mathematically. Hamiltonian (1) commutes with the operator of in-
version ˆI and the operator of total momentum ˆP, but two last operators do not commute
with each other. According to the well-known theorem of quantum mechanics [45, 46], each

energy level of such a system should be degenerate. The exception is the energy level cor-
responding to the zero momentum. Indeed, let the state Ψ1 correspond to the momentum
~p1 and the energy E1: ˆPΨ1 = ~p1Ψ1 and ˆHΨ1 = E1Ψ1. Let us act by the inversion

other words, the state Ψ2 is characterized by the momentum
Ψ2 correspond to diﬀerent momenta, they are physically diﬀerent states. Hence, the level E1
is degenerate. Only at p1 = 0 the states Ψ1 and Ψ2 are characterized by the identical energies
and momenta. Such states are equivalent. In this case, the level E1 is non-degenerate. If WF
Ψ1 corresponds to the energy E1 and does not correspond to a deﬁnite momentum, it can be
expanded in WFs of states with a deﬁnite momentum and the energy E1. Such expansion
must contain at least one WF with ~p
= 0, i.e., the state Ψ1 is degenerate. However, GS
must be non-degenerate [47]. Thus, the genuine GS can correspond only to zero momentum.
The structure of WF of the ground state, Ψ0, of a Bose system with periodic BCs can be
easily determined. The condition p = 0 and formulae (8) and (10) imply that Ψ0 should not
vary at a translation. Therefore, it can depend only on the diﬀerence of coordinates. The

−

general form of such nodeless function is given by formulae (6), (4) or (6), (7). This can be

proved strictly (see [39] and Appendix 1 below).

It is interesting to note that the structure of Ψ0 (6), (4) of a quantum liquid is usually
obtained from the requirement that Ψ0 should be invariable at a translation [p = 0 in (8)]
[16, 39]. However, the translation invariance of a system admits p
= 0 in (8). Apparently,
it was not shown previously in the literature that the Bose system with p
= 0 does not
correspond to GS. This was proved above. Therefore, the condition p = 0 is primary, and
the translation invariance of Ψ0 is a consequence of this requirement.

Note also that, in a series of articles [35, 40, 48, 49, 50], Bose liquid and Bose crystal were

described by a “shadow” WF (SWF)

If ur, usr, us are represented in the form of

(13), (14) is a partial case of the general solution (6), (4) [or (6), (7)] written in a diﬀerent

form. This was noted in reviews [35, 36]. In this case, SWF has a relatively simple structure

and, apparently, enables one to indirectly involve, at least partially, all higher correlation

corrections [35]. The authors of works [35, 40, 48, 49, 50] assert that SWF (13), (14) describes

a Bose liquid at some densities and a Bose crystal at other ones. This is equivalent to the
assumption that, at some ρ = ρc, the liquid solution (6), (4) spontaneously transforms into a
crystalline solution (6), (7).

We have shown above that the ground state of a periodic system of interacting spinless

bosons corresponds to zero momentum. Among four above-considered solutions (liquid solu-

tion and three crystalline ones), this requirement is satisﬁed by the liquid solution (6), (4)

and the crystalline one (6), (7). The other two crystalline solutions, (2) and (5), describe

the states without a deﬁnite momentum. Hence, only WF (6), (7) can be an exact solution

for GS of a crystal with periodic BCs. The key question is as follows: Can such crystalline

solution exist?

2.2 Degeneracy of an anisotropic state

The available literature gives no answer to the above question, to our knowledge. Apparently,

it is impossible to ﬁnd it analytically. The numerical methods also do not give an exact answer

because they give incomplete information. However, the answer can be found by means of the

symmetry analysis considered in what follows. Two other methods are proposed in [51, 52].

×

Hamiltonian (1) of the 3D system is invariant under the group of orthogonal transfor-
mations O(3) = SO(3)
Ci consisting of the group of rotations SO(3) and the group of
inversions Ci (it contains two elements: inversion I and I 2 = 1; here and below, we consider
that any symmetry transformation is applied to all coordinates r1, . . . , rN ). This invariance
is preserved if ˆH also includes a three-particle interaction [53, 54, 55, 56]. Therefore, ˆH
commutes with the operator of rotation ˆR = eiϕiϕ ˆL/~ [45, 46, 57], where ˆL is the operator of
total angular momentum of the system, ϕ is a rotation angle, and the unit vector iϕ sets the
2
rotation axis. Hence, [ ˆH, ˆL] = 0, and [ ˆH, ˆL
and ˆLz commute
with each other, the complete set of eigenfunctions can be constructed so that those functions

2
] = 0. Since the operators ˆH, ˆL

be the eigenfunctions of these three operators [45, 46]. It is important that BCs must admit

this (as a rule, this point is not mentioned in textbooks). Therefore, we consider the system

to be inﬁnite (closed or not) or ﬁnite ball-shaped. In the ﬁrst case, BCs are invariant under

the translations and rotations, which corresponds to the uniformity and isotropy of the space.

This gives the laws of conservation of the momentum and angular momentum [45, 46]. If BCs

would not be uniform and isotropic at inﬁnity, then the laws of conservation of the momentum

and angular momentum would not hold in our world. For a ﬁnite ball, BCs are invariant only

under the rotations. In both cases, since the Hamiltonian and BCs are invariant with respect

to the rotations, WFs can be set so that they are transformed by the irreducible represen-

tations of the rotation group SO(3) [57, 58]. This group is characterized by the complete

collection of irreducible representations g

ˆTl(g) with l = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, . . . ,

and the

dimension 2l + 1 (here, g is an element of the group). The representations with integer and

half-integer l are, respectively, one- and two-valued [57, 58, 59, 60]. The scalar WFs can be
transformed only by the representations with integer l. In this case, ˆL
Ψ(l) = ~2l(l + 1)Ψ(l)
[57, 58]. The operator of rotation is deﬁned by the formula [45, 46]

where rj and ´rj = Arj are the coordinates of a vector before and after a rotation, A is the

degeneracy multiplicity is equal to the sum of the dimensions 2l+1 of all these representations.

Thus, only the isotropic state is not degenerate. It is the state that transits into itself at any

rotation and is transformed by the unit representation of the group SO(3). Since the genuine

GS of a Bose system is non-degenerate [47] (see also Appendix 2 below), it should correspond
to an isotropic state. In Appendix 1 it is shown that Ψ0 (6), (4) corresponds to ˆLΨ0 = 0
and, therefore, is isotropic. Thus, we have proved that any anisotropic state of an inﬁnite

(or ﬁnite ball-shaped) 3D system of spinless bosons is degenerate and, therefore, does not

correspond to the genuine GS of the system.

WFs of a many-boson system are usually constructed as eigenfunctions of the momentum

operator [38, 39, 61, 62, 63, 64]. In this case, WF of any excited state of a periodic system of

N bosons can be written in the form [61, 65] (see also Appendix 1)

transfers solution (18) into the equivalent solution: Ψp(r1, . . . , rN )
Such approach assumes that ˆH is invariant under translations and, therefore, commutes with
the operator of translations ˆT = eiaP/~ and the operator of total momentum ˆP. In view of
this, one can ﬁnd the complete set of orthogonal functions, being the eigenfunctions of the
2
operators ˆH and ˆP (it diﬀers from the complete set for the operators ˆH, ˆL
, and ˆLz, since ˆP
and ˆL do not commute with each other). Functions (18) with all possible p and the function
Ψ0 (6), (4) realize such a set [39, 61, 65]. It can be called a P-set. Earlier, the analysis of
crystalline solutions was performed only within the P-approach. Apparently, this is why the
degeneracy of the anisotropic state was not noticed.

The many-boson systems are usually described in the P-approach, since it is simpler and
more physical (as a rule, a quasiparticle is characterized by a deﬁnite momentum, rather than
an angular momentum). The L-set of eigenfunctions is used for the description of the electron
shell of an atom. For many-boson systems, the L-approach was used rarely and only for the
corresponding BCs [66, 67]. If BCs admit both approaches, then any WF from the P-set can
be expanded in the complete set of WFs from the L-set, and vice versa. Interestingly, Ψ0
(6), (4) belongs simultaneously to the P- and L-set of WFs. This function is transformed by
the unit representations of the SO(3) group and the group of translations T (3).

Thus, for two types of systems (ﬁnite ball-like and inﬁnite ones), we have shown that the

crystal solutions do not contain the genuine (nodeless) GS and, therefore, do not form the

complete set of eigenfunctions of the Schr¨odinger boundary-value problem. The genuine GS

correspond always to the liquid solution. Based on the liquid GS, one can construct a set of

excited liquid states. The group SO(3) contains, as subgroups, point groups corresponding

to seven types (syngonies) of crystal lattices. Therefore, it is obvious that, for two indicated

types of systems, the complete set of WFs of the Schr¨odinger boundary-value problem con-

tains all solutions for each syngony and all solutions for a liquid. The lowest state of a crystal

of each type must correspond to WF with a large number of nodes. For the inﬁnite system

such a solution can be rotated by any angle, then we will apparently obtain another solution

of the same boundary-value problem [51]. That is, the complete set of WFs of a Bose system

should contain solutions for crystals of all possible types, including the inﬁnite number (for

the inﬁnite system) of all admissible rotated solutions of each type. In this case, the collection

8

of solutions for a crystal with ﬁxed lattice and orientation contains the inﬁnite number of

WFs, but is an inﬁnitely small part of the complete collection of WFs of the boundary-value

problem. The latter can be found by means of the construction of the general system of
2
, and ˆLz or (for the inﬁnite system) the operators ˆH
eigenfunctions of the operators ˆH, ˆL
and ˆP. It is known that each type of crystals is stable at deﬁnite densities. In such interval of
densities, the lowest state of a crystal must correspond to a local statistical-thermodynamic

minimum of the energy in the space of states (this is the minimum in the sense that small

perturbations of a crystal increase its energy). Otherwise, the crystal would be unstable. In

this case, the absolute minimum corresponds to a liquid (see Fig. 1).

For clarity, consider the following example. Assume that the Hamiltonian ˆHc of a Bose
system contains an external potential Uc corresponding to a point symmetry group of a crystal
of some type:

) + Uc(r1, . . . , rN ).

(20)

In this case, the Hamiltonian is characterized by two symmetries: the continuous group O(3)
and a discrete group that is a subgroup of the group O(3) and corresponds to the potential Uc.
It is clear that if Uc sets a very deep well on the place of each lattice site, then the structure
of low-lying states must be deﬁned by the potential Uc. That is, all WFs of low-lying states
must be transformed by irreducible representations of the discrete group of the crystal. In

this case, the crystalline solutions apparently form the complete set of eigenfunctions of the

given boundary-value problem, and GS of the crystal should correspond to the nodeless non-

degenerate GS of the system. As the potential
decreases, the solutions for WFs should
approach those for the unperturbed Hamiltonian (1). If the potential Uc is weak relative to
the interatomic one, then the structure of all WFs has to be determined by the group O(3).

Uc|

Therefore, we may expect that, at some small ﬁnite Uc, WFs acquire the structure of WFs
of the unperturbed Hamiltonian (1). We may expect that, in this case, the nodeless GS
corresponds to a liquid at any density, and the weak potential Uc changes insigniﬁcantly the
solutions corresponding to Hamiltonian (1). As Uc decreases to an inﬁnitely small value, the
solutions should coincide with those for Hamiltonian (1).

We mention the idea to obtain the crystal nodeless GS from a liquid GS as a result of

the spontaneous breaking of the translational and rotational invariances of the Hamiltonian
(1) due to the introduction of an inﬁnitely small crystal potential Uc in (1) [9, 68]. In our
opinion, such mechanism does not work. Indeed, it was supposed in [9, 68] that the constant

density (liquid GS) arises due to the averaging over many conﬁgurations that diﬀer from one

another only by translations. Therefore, the removal of the translational invariance could

lead to the crystal nodeless GS with oscillating density. We think that this reasoning is

not quite correct. We note that, under a translation WF (18), (19) is only multiplied by a

unit modulus constant. Therefore, all states diﬀering from one another only by translations

enter the statistical sum as one state. In other words, there is no averaging over such states.

Moreover, the constant density is characteristic of any WF (18), (19). The crystalline nodeless

GS cannot be obtained as a result of the spontaneous choice of one of solutions (18), (19),

or (6), (4), since the crystalline nodeless WF is simply absent among those WFs: At any

density, the nodeless WF corresponds to a liquid, as is shown above.

Note that Hamiltonian (1) is also invariant under the group of permutations SN . It is of
interest that any symmetric Bose solution is transformed by the identical (unit) representation
of the group SN . Thus, the isotropic solution (6), (4) realizes the most symmetric state of an
inﬁnite periodic system. This state is invariant with respect to all groups of symmetries of
the Hamiltonian: O(3), T (3), and SN . Apparently, for any BCs the ground state corresponds
to the most symmetric solution that is transformed by the unit representations of all groups

of symmetries of the boundary-value problem [58]. Indeed, such a solution is non-degenerate

and changes most smoothly in space. Therefore, it should correspond to the lowest energy.

symmetry group O(3)

We note also that for a ﬁnite ball the Hamiltonian and BCs are characterized by the
SN. Therefore, GS should be invariant with respect to these groups,
which corresponds to a liquid state. Thus, the lowest state of a ﬁnite crystal ball corresponds

×

to WF with nodes for any parameters of the system.

In the above reasoning, the degeneracy is related to the noncommutativity of the operators
ˆLx, ˆLy, ˆLz. In work [51], the degeneracy of an anisotropic state was proved for an inﬁnite Bose
system with the help of a general quantum-mechanical analysis. In this case, the degeneracy
is related to the noncommutativity of the operators ˆL and ˆP. In the two-dimensional (2D)
case, ˆL has only the component ˆLz. In this case, only the proof from work [51] is valid.

We now make some remarks about the method in use. It is impossible to ﬁnd the wave

functions for a many-particle system of complicated shape. Therefore, it is reasonable to take

10

such BCs and such size of the system for which the solution can be most easily found. The

properties of a macroscopic system should not depend on the shape of boundaries and should

not vary at an increase of the system sizes to inﬁnity (at a constant density). Therefore, we

considered the systems that are the simplest for the symmetry analysis: the inﬁnite system

under periodic BCs and a ﬁnite ball-shaped one under zero BCs. For clarity, it would be
useful to give the general solution in the L-approach (besides the solutions (18), (19) in the
P-approach). However, such solutions have not been found in the available literature. The
degeneracy of an anisotropic state of the inﬁnite system can be seen without calculations: if
the isotropic WF Ψ0 at some density transits spontaneously to an anisotropic WF Ψ′

a separated vector k, then exactly the same solutions Ψ′

degeneracy. For a ﬁnite system, the degeneracy is always ﬁnite [47]. This is due to BCs. For

example, for the periodic BCs, the momentum of the system of quasiparticles can have only

discrete values. Therefore, it can be “turned” only by certain discrete angles.

For a visual image we give several known anisotropic solutions for an inﬁnite periodic Bose

system. The solutions for a liquid with one and two phonons in the zero approximation reads
Ψk(r1, . . . , rN ) = ρ−kΨ0 [12, 37, 38, 61] and Ψk1k2(r1, . . . , rN ) = ρ−k1ρ−k2Ψ0 [65, 69, 70],
respectively. These solutions are inﬁnite-fold degenerate with respect to rotations. The

crystal solution for such a system was proposed in [51]. It is also inﬁnite-fold degenerate.
In all these cases the degeneracy is caused by that the Hamiltonian ˆH (1) commutes with
the operators ˆL and ˆP, which do not commute with each other. Visually, the degeneracy is
related to the equivalence of all directions in space.

2.3 Possible exact ansatz for the ground state of a Bose crystal

Let us try to ﬁnd WF of a zero-temperature crystal. We will call a zero-temperature state

of a crystal the ground state of a crystal. It is obvious that the weakly excited states of the

Bose system cannot correspond to a crystal. In particular, the solution for the liquid state

with one phonon in the zero approximation reads [12, 37, 38, 61, 71]

Ψk(r1, . . . , rN ) = ρ−kΨ0, Ψ0 = eS0

(21)

(for periodic BCs). The solution for a two-phonon liquid state under the same BCs in the

zero approximation is [65, 69, 70]

Ψk1k2(r1, . . . , rN ) = ρ−k1ρ−k2Ψ0.

(22)

Therefore, it is clear that GS of a crystal should correspond to a highly excited state of the

Bose system. In addition, it is natural to expect that the network of nodes of WF does not

change at the displacement of the crystal by the lattice period. The solution for GS of a

crystal can be easily guessed for a simple rectangular lattice with N

and the zero BCs

Here, the product of sines directly sets the crystal lattice (we suppose that faces coincide
with lattice planes), (klx, kly, klz) = (lxπ/Lx, lyπ/Ly, lzπ/Lz) = (π/ax, π/ay, π/az), ax, ay, az
are the periods of the lattice, lx, ly, lz are integers, Lx, Ly, Lz are sizes of the crystal; and
Sc(r1, . . . , rN ) is a correction function. Function (23) has a wave structure, but possesses a lot
of nodes, in contrast to (5). Near any maximum x0, the function sin(kx) can be represented
as e−α2(x−x0)2/2. This allows us to theoretically get the ﬁtting constant α with reasonable

accuracy [72]. Furthermore, if we use ϕ(r) =
α2r2/2, then those conﬁgurations, for which the atoms are located near the lattice
ϕ(r) =
sites, are described by functions (23) and (2) equally (a more complicated “nondiagonal”
function ϕ(r) was considered in [41, 73]). On the whole, WF (2) can be considered as a
fairly good zero approximation. This property, jointly with ﬁtting parameters, enables one to

explain with the help of WF (2) some experimental properties of crystals [6, 74]. However, the

general structure of the wave function is represented by ansatz (2) incorrectly. In particular,
ansatz (2) loses the condensate of atoms Ψc(r)
sin (klxx) sin (klyy) sin (klz z) which follows
from WF (23). Moreover, ansatz (2) does not catch that GS of a crystal has to be higher by

≃

energy than GS of a liquid (see Fig. 1).

Note that a possible ansatz for GS of a crystal with periodic BCs was proposed in [51].

Comparing WF (23) with the one-phonon (21) and two-phonon (22) solutions for a liquid,

we see that GS of a crystal with the zero BCs corresponds to a liquid with N identical
quasiparticles with quasimomentum kl. That is, GS of a crystal can be considered as a liquid
In this case, namely the condensate of quasiparticles

creates a crystal lattice in the medium. As was mentioned above, GS (23) contains also
a condensate of atoms with quasimomentum kl. Small deviations from GS of a crystal
correspond to a crystal with several quasiparticles or defects. The temperature T of a crystal

can be introduced in the ordinary way with the help of the partition function, by connecting

T with quasiparticles.

We note that the solutions for a crystal that are characterized by a condensate of atoms

with quasimomentum k

= 0 were considered previously [23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 31]. However,

it was assumed in those works that, in addition to such “coherent crystal” [27, 28], there

exists the “ordinary crystal” with nodeless ground-state WF and without a condensate. But

the above analysis shows that such “ordinary crystal” is impossible, at least for an inﬁnite

system. Moreover, the idea of that a crystal is formed by a condensate of quasiparticles with
quasimomentum 2π/ax [in one dimension (1D)] was advanced in [25].
above conclusion, but the quasiparticles here and in [25] are diﬀerent. In function (23), the

It is similar to the

quasiparticles are introduced relative to the genuine liquid GS of the system, whereas the

12

6
quasiparticles in [25] are considered relative to GS of a crystal.

The above analysis uses an anisotropy and is not suitable for a 1D space. In the recent

work [52], the exact solutions were found for a 1D system of point bosons with a small value

of N. In this case, the crystalline solution agrees with formula (23). We are not aware of

other exact solutions for a 1D crystal which is not placed in a trap ﬁeld. On the other hand,

for the 1D system of dipolar bosons, the crystal regime was numerically found for the genuine

nodeless GS (see the recent work [75] and references therein). Thus, in one dimension, the

genuine GS can be either a liquid or a crystal, depending on the nature of the interatomic

interaction and on parameters of the system.

We have noted above that the properties of a macroscopic system should not depend on

the shape of boundaries. It is a commonly accepted assumption. However, it is not proved

in the general case. In our opinion, we cannot omit, in principle, the possibility of a strong

inﬂuence of boundaries as a topological eﬀect. But we do not know works, where a similar

eﬀect is accurately found. The available solutions show that the boundaries exert a negligible

inﬂuence on the bulk properties of a Bose liquid such as the energy of GS (see the solutions

for the periodic [37, 39, 76, 77], zero [78, 79, 80], and mixed [81] BCs) and the dispersion

law of quasiparticles [80, 82, 83]. In this case, the solutions [76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82] are exact.

Based on the above-executed analysis and those solutions, we assume that the genuine GS

of a Bose system corresponds to a liquid at any shape of boundaries, any density, and any

dimensionality of a system.

Monte Carlo solutions for Bose crystals are discussed in Appendix 3. The nature of GS

of a Bose system can be clariﬁed by the multiconﬁguration time-dependent Hartree method
[84] that allows one to ﬁnd a solution with good accuracy for a 1D system of N <

Apparently, the last modiﬁcations of this method [85] enable one to study even 2D systems
of N <
10 bosons. This method is also suitable for the study of the transition from the

crystalline genuine GS to the liquid one, as the bare crystal potential Uc decreases, for 1D
and 2D systems of N <

3 Physical consequences

On the basis of the above analysis, we assume that, for any BCs, the inequality

holds. Here, Ec

the same ρ. However, the phase transitions occur in experiments at the same pressure P .

(26)

For 4He, inequality (25) is satisﬁed (at the pressure of crystallization P
pendix 3). The liquid satisfying condition (25) must be stable against crystallization, at low

25 atm, see Ap-

≈

P and T . If (26) is satisﬁed, the liquid corresponds to a metastable state, but the duration

of the transition into the stable crystalline state may be long.

Inequality (24) testiﬁes to the existence of a large number of quantum states corresponding

to a liquid and possessing the energies less than the GS energy of a crystal. We will call such

states “under-crystal liquid” (“underliquid” for short). Since this region of states is large,

one can expect that at least part of it is observable. It is also clear that, at suﬃciently low

temperatures, the underliquid has to be superﬂuid. The creation of such superﬂuids will

mean that, in addition to the vessels with He II, physical laboratories will possess the vessels

with other superﬂuids. Let us try to ascertain how the underliquid can be produced.

For all known liquids, except for 4He, the (P, T ) phase diagram is separated into the
regions corresponding to a gas, a liquid, and a crystal and has the triple point (see Fig. 2).
The (P, T ) diagram of 4He has no triple point: the gas contacts only with the liquid. Each
of the transitions (gas–liquid, liquid–crystal, and gas–crystal) is operated by three equations
describing the equilibrium between phase 1 and phase 2 [86]: P1 = P2 ≡

where Ej is the internal energy per atom for the system staying in the j-th phase, vj and sj
are the volume and entropy (per atom) of the j-th phase. Equation (27) is equivalent to the
equality of the chemical potentials of phases 1 and 2: µ1(P, T ) = µ2(P, T ).

The possible position of the underliquid region on the (P, T ) diagram is shown by stars

in Fig. 2. The upper and lower boundaries of the underliquid region are set by condition

(27). The lower boundary corresponds to the transition underliquid–gas. The possible upper

boundary corresponds to the transition underliquid–crystal. In the limits of these boundaries,
the liquid can be stable or metastable, as was noted above. The right boundary Pul−c(T ) is
shown in Fig. 2 approximately. It corresponds not to a phase transition, but to the condition
El(P, T ) = Ec
0(P ) (that is possible, if (25) is satisﬁed). The equation for the lower boundary
will be obtained in what follows. It is easy to estimate the location of the upper boundary
Pul−c(T ). At T = 0, relation (27) yields

Using the parameters of the triple point for neon (T3 = 24.55 K [88, 89, 90], cs = 628 m/s,

The basic question is: How can we “get to” the region of underliquid in experiments?
(The underliquid state of 4He has already been obtained: as it is easy to guess, this is He
II.) On top and to the right from the region of underliquid, the crystalline states are placed.
The region of underliquid corresponds to very low temperatures: T <
0.5T3. The crystalline
∼

15

 
 
states at such T were experimentally studied for many substances, but the underliquid states

were not found. According to (25) and (26), the crystal with T and P from the region of

underliquid should be metastable or stable, respectively. In the metastable state, such crystals

live, apparently, very long (otherwise, the underliquid would be found experimentally long

ago). Therefore, we believe that it is impossible to produce an underliquid from a crystal (by

decreasing T or P ).

The underliquid can be, apparently, obtained by strong supercooling of a liquid whose

initial temperature is higher than the melting one. To avoid the crystallization, it is necessary

to purify a liquid from impurities and to use a vessel with smooth walls (or to cover the walls

with a special coating, see below). A shortcoming of the method consists in the necessity of

a strong supercooling, which requires the high degree of smoothness of walls and of purity of

a liquid.

It may be easier to get in the underliquid region by isothermal compression of a gas at
T3,
T3. According to Fig. 2, at the isothermal increase in the pressure of a gas with T
we cross ﬁrstly the curve gas–crystal and then the curve gas–liquid. Therefore, the gas must

turn into a crystal (not in the underliquid), which corresponds to experiments. Nevertheless,

we will show below that the underliquid can be obtained in such a way. For this purpose, it is
T3 and to create the conditions

necessary to perform the transition at the temperature T

preventing the crystallization.

To substantiate this point, we consider the transitions gas–crystal (g-c) and gas–liquid

(g-l) in more details. First, one needs to get the dependences P (T ) setting the curves g-c

and g-l. As is known, along the line P (T ) of the phase transition the Clapeyron–Clausius

4He has no triple point. If we set formally T3 = 1 K for 4He, then Eq. (38) agrees very

In Fig. 2, this solution is shown as the curve g-l and solution (38) as the curve g-c. Of

course, such correspondence between the formulae and the curves is only qualitative. For

Fig. 2 we use parameter ξ = 9.69 corresponding to neon. In this case, the parameter f = 7

curves g-c and g-l, respectively. The exact curves g-l and g-c can signiﬁcantly diﬀer from
those presented in Fig. 2, because the corrections s2 and v2 were taken into account in a
rough model form. However, this analysis is suﬃcient to show that the solutions of such type

correctly describe experimental curves g-l and g-c. The second important conclusion is that
though the corrections s2 and v2 separate the curves g-l and g-c, these curves should be close.
For example, at ˜T = 0.1 we have Pgl/Pgc = e ˜T 3− ˜T f
1.001, according to relations (38) and
(40) with f = 7.

It is signiﬁcant that, for inert elements, the slopes of the experimental P (T ) curves g-l (at
T > T3) and g-c (at T < T3) near the triple point are very close [89]. This agrees with our
conclusion that these curves should be close at T

T3.

If the ratio Pgl/Pgc = ζ is close to 1, the phase transitions gas–crystal and gas–liquid are
“switched-on” almost simultaneously. At the compression, the system transits in a liquid or a

If we use a vessel with smooth walls whose microstructure diﬀers signiﬁcantly from that of

According to the analysis in Appendix 4, in order to prevent the crystallization of a gas

and to “switch-on” the bulk spontaneous mechanism of formation of nuclei, one needs to

purify a gas from suspended solid impurities and to prevent the formation of crystalline

nuclei on the walls. To achieve the latter, one can take a vessel with smooth walls (though,

it is impossible to obtain an ideally smooth walls), and the molecules of walls should weakly

interact with the molecules of a gas (or the crystalline ordering of walls should signiﬁcantly

diﬀer from that of crystal nuclei forming from a gas). In addition, the molecular dynamics

simulations show that the crystallization of a liquid on walls is suppressed, if the walls are

covered with a solid amorphous layer whose structure is similar to that of a liquid [97] (see

also [98], Sect. 2.4.2). We propose one more method: One can cover the walls from inside by

a microscopically thin ﬁlm of He II, then the surface of walls should be liquid and smooth.

In this case, the formation of crystal nuclei on the walls would become diﬃcult. Moreover,

the interaction of helium atoms with molecules of the majority of gases is weak, which must

prevent the adsorption of molecules of a gas on the walls and the formation of surface nuclei.
It is noted in books [99, 100] that, at the compression of a gas at a temperature T < T3, the
metastable liquid is sometimes formed and then crystallizes. These properties are evidence
0(P ) < El
of the validity of the inequality Ec

0(P ) > El
some substances, the inequality Ec
0(P ) (25) should hold. In this case, the liquid
formed at the compression of a gas should be stable and should not crystallize.

Interestingly, the transition crystal–underliquid can occur at a negative pressure. By

a crystal. The idea of the creation of a liquid from a crystal by applying a negative pressure

was advanced by J. Frenkel [100, 101].

The above analysis shows that the form of the (P, T )-diagram at low P and T should

depend on how we got in this region. If we have got into it from above (by cooling a crystal),

we obtain an ordinary diagram with the triple point. The result will be the same, if we

will try to get into the region of underliquid from the bottom (from the region of a gas) or

from the right (from the region of a liquid) in the absence of the conditions preventing the

formation of crystal nuclei. But if we try to enter from the bottom (or from the right) in the

presence of such conditions, then we should obtain the state of underliquid. In other words,

the phase diagram in the region to the left from the melting curve and above the sublimation

curve should have two levels (or two “layers”): liquid-type and crystal-type ones. Such liquid

states were obtained previously by supercooling a liquid. In this case, it was considered in

19

the literature that the liquid state at T = 0 is impossible. Therefore, the supercooling of a

liquid down to T

0 and the obtaining of a stable liquid by the compression of a gas at

T

0 were also considered impossible. However, both are possible, since a liquid can have

≈

≈

the zero temperature, as was shown in Sect. 2.

Our reasoning is general and should be suitable for any inert element (H2, Ne, Ar, etc., see
review [102]), except for helium. We propose to carry out three following experiments. (i) To
supercool isobarically liquid H2, Ne, and Ar down to temperatures that are by several times
less than the temperature of the Bose condensation of the ideal gas Tc = 3.31
kBm n2/3 [94]
(here, s is the spin of a particle; for liquid inert elements, except for hydrogen and helium,
Tc < 1 K). In this case, we should obtain a superﬂuid underliquid. We note that, at a strong
overcooling, the energy barrier of the nucleation for some liquids, apparently, disappears (see

(2s+1)2/3

~2

[98], Sect. 1.1.4 and 2.2.2). Such liquids can easily crystallize spontaneously. One needs to
pass through this temperature region and to get lower T <
Tc at which the microcrystals
∼
should become unstable (according to the above analysis). (ii) To compress isothermally a
0.1T3 up to a pressure that exceeds by several times the
dilute gas (H2, Ne, Ar) at T
saturated vapor pressure for the same T . The underliquid should also be created. In both

∼

experiments, it is necessary to create the conditions hampering the crystallization (see the

discussion above and Appendix 4), and condition (25) must be satisﬁed for the stability

of a liquid.

In the second experiment, a less supersaturation is required. Therefore, the

requirements to the puriﬁcation and to walls can be apparently less strict. (iii) To create a
negative pressure Pul−c <
0.1T3. One can
expect that some of such crystals will melt into an underliquid.

If the underliquid is metastable (inequality (26)) and has a small life-time, then such
underliquid state can be unobservable. However, 4He is stable (inequality (25)). Therefore, it
is natural to expect that, among inert elements, there are several other ones with the stable

underliquid state. In view of this, it is desirable to execute the experiments with all inert
elements (except for 4He).

The inert elements were investigated mainly at T >

or liquid turned into a crystal, rather than into an underliquid. Moreover, the underliquid

state was considered impossible and was not sought.

Why do the liquids in the Nature crystallize at the cooling, though the crystal corresponds

to a highly excited state of a system? Mathematically, this is related to the fulﬁllment of

condition (27) for the liquid–crystal transition. The possible physical explanation is as follows:

at the cooling of a liquid down to some temperature, the microcrystals arising as ﬂuctuations

become stable. And the visual reason is that the system falls into the local energy minimum

20

corresponding to a crystal (see Fig. 1). As a result, the liquid crystallizes, and we obtain a

crystal with some number of quasiparticles. In this case, the cooling of the crystal means a

decrease in the number of quasiparticles introduced relative to GS of a crystal.

We note also that, at the strong supercooling, the viscosity of some liquids increases

sharply, and they transit into a glass-like state. However, the atoms of inert gases are spher-
ically symmetric (except for hydrogen which forms molecules H2) and, therefore, should not
turn into a glass at the supercooling. We may expect that, at T <
0.1Tc, liquid inert ele-
∼
ments have to be similar to He II, i.e., they should contain a condensate of atoms with zero

momentum and should be superﬂuid.

Undoubtedly, inequality (24) should be correct. Therefore, the region of underliquid must

exist, and the task is to enter this region in experiments.

In Appendix 3, we also consider the third principle of thermodynamics and properties of

4He.

4 Conclusions

Our analysis shows that the genuine ground state of a system of spinless bosons should

experimental data. However, we expect that relation (25) holds for the majority of inert
elements (in particular, it holds for 4He). The underliquid state, that does not crystallize
at the cooling and is superﬂuid at very low temperatures, should exist for such substances.

→

This is our main experimental prediction. We assume that the underliquid can be created in

experiments by compressing a gas at a low temperature or by strong supercooling an ordinary

liquid (in both cases, it is necessary to create the conditions preventing the crystallization).

According to the above analysis, a Bose crystal is a standing wave in the probability ﬁeld.

Most likely, this property is a general principle valid not only for Bose systems. Therefore,

it is possible that the underliquid state and the superﬂuidity are inherent not only in inert

elements. Such properties can be inherent in all substances that form molecular crystals:

inert elements, water, methane, etc. Although it may seem implausible now.

If inequality (24) is true under any boundary conditions, it will change our comprehension

of the nature of crystals and lead to the discovery of new physical phenomena. For example,

the space apparatus “New Horizons” found in 2015 that the Sputnik Planitia surface on Pluto

consists of solid nitrogen and is similar to a mosaic made of hexagons and pentagons. This

1Such idea was proposed previously in [72], but that work of ours is immature and contains something very similar to errors;

see, in particular, the Introduction in [80]

valley has no craters, though they are present on the remaining Pluto’s surface. It is possible

that a liquid water ocean exists under the surface [103, 104, 105]. That is surprising because

the Pluto’s surface temperature is about 40 K. However, we have established above that the

liquids of low viscosity can exist even at T = 0 K. This can help one to understand some

anomalous properties of cosmic objects.

We hope that the above-proposed experiments to create the underliquid state will be

carried out.

Formula (48) can be written in the form (18), (19) (with other bj), which is more suitable

for the description of quasiparticles.

23

We note that function (49) can be isotropic (formula (4)) or anisotropic (formula (7)). The
above analysis (in this appendix) does not allow us to establish whether S0 (49) is isotropic.
However, it was shown in book [47] (see Appendix 2 below) that GS of a Bose system is non-

degenerate. Moreover, we have shown in Section 2 that any anisotropic state of the inﬁnite
3D Bose system is degenerate. This property establishes a restriction for S0 (49): for the
inﬁnite 3D Bose system, this function must be isotropic, since it corresponds to the ground

state. Such function can depend only on the quantities that are invariable at any rotation,

as well as at any translations.

Therefore, we can write S0 in the form S0 = S0(f1, . . . , fj), where fl is (rj1 −

rj2)2, (rj1 −
rj4). It can be proved directly that such S0 satisﬁes the

It is natural to expect that, at the transition to a ﬁnite periodic system, the structure of S0
does not change. Hence, for a ﬁnite periodic 3D system, S0 should also be isotropic. Thus,
function (6), (4) speciﬁes the general form of GS WF of a periodic 3D Bose system.

6 Appendix 2. Proof of the nondegeneracy of the ground state

In the classical monograph by R. Courant and D. Hilbert [47], the theorem of nodes was

proved for one particle located in a ﬁnite two-dimensional volume with zero BCs. The proof

can be easily generalized to the case of a large number of particles and any dimensionality
of space. The proof in [47] admits the presence of the degeneracy (Ej = Ej−1) of ﬁnite
multiplicity (multiplicity is ﬁnite, if the volume of the system is ﬁnite, see [47],
2). If GS
§
is doubly degenerate, then one of the states is described by a nodeless WF ψ1 (according
to the theorem of nodes). WF ψ2 of the second state can have a single node, according to
the same theorem. On the other hand, ψ2 should be orthogonal to ψ1 and, therefore, must
have at least one node. Thus, the theorem of nodes [47] admits the possibility for GS to be

degenerate.

The nondegeneracy of GS was proved at the other place of book [47]. The proof is based

on the Jacobi method (see [47],

7). We will give it in a slightly more detailed form.

24

exists a solution ψ1 of Eq. (53) corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue E1, then ψ1 can be
found by solving the following variation problem [47]: the inequality

should be satisﬁed for all functions ϕ(x, y) that are equal to zero on the boundary of the
region G and have “good” properties (ϕ should be continuous, whereas ϕx and ϕy should be
∂ϕ/∂y. Inequality (54) becomes an equality
piecewise continuous). Here, ϕx ≡
only for ϕ(x, y) = c1ψ1(x, y), where c1 = const. It follows from the theorem of nodes that ψ1
has no nodes [47].

∂ϕ/∂x, ϕy ≡

Assume that GS is degenerate and corresponds to two functions: ψ1 and ψ2.

In this
case, ψ1 has no nodes, and ψ2 must have one node (as was noted above). In this case from
the variation viewpoint, ψ1 and ψ2 satisfy condition (54) and the zero BCs, and ψ2 satisﬁes
additionally the condition of orthogonality of the functions ψ1 and ψ2. Since ψ1 has a constant
sign everywhere inside G, we may set ψ2(x, y) = ϑ(x, y)ψ1(x, y). We will see now whether
such solution is possible. We set ϕ(x, y) = η(x, y)ψ1(x, y) in D[ϕ] (54). Then

Let us use the relations 2ηηx = (η2)x, 2ηηy = (η2)y and integrate the terms with ηηx and ηηy
by parts. We obtain two integrals over the boundary which are equal to zero due to the zero

BCs. The remaining terms give

The equality is obtained only for η(x, y) = C = const. Hence, the wave function corre-

sponding to the energy E1 can have only the form const
ψ2(x, y) = ϑ(x, y)ψ1(x, y) with ϑ(x, y)
= const is impossible. This proves that the lowest
level is always non-degenerate. In this case, any excited state ψj>1(x, y) can be degenerate
(because ψj>1(x, y) has nodes, and, therefore, the representation ϕ(x, y) = η(x, y)ψj(x, y) is
inapplicable).

·

If we pass in all formulae from x, y to r1, . . . , rN , the reasoning conserves its validity.
Therefore, the conclusion about the nondegeneracy of GS is true for systems with any N and

for any dimensionality of space. The above analysis was performed for a ﬁnite system under

the zero BCs. We may expect that the main conclusion holds for any BCs and for inﬁnite

systems. Apparently, the above consideration can be applied to inﬁnite systems, if the zero

BCs are set at inﬁnity.

4He, Monte Carlo simulations

We now consider the third principle of thermodynamics. Some researchers believe that namely

a crystal (rather than a liquid) corresponds to the genuine GS of a system, since the crystal
is more ordered in the r-space and, therefore, should be characterized by a lower entropy.

However, we have seen in Sect. 2 that in point of fact a liquid is characterized by a higher

symmetry as compared with a crystal. Moreover, according to quantum statistics, the entropy
is determined by properties of a system in the space of quantum states (not in the r-space).
It is given by the formula S = kB ln(N(E)) [95], where N(E) is the number of states with
energy close to E. To what is N(E) equal for the GS of a Bose crystal? Inequality (24)

the phase under consideration (gas, liquid, or crystal) into account in the statistical sum. In

addition, the complete set of eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian should contain the solutions

for crystal lattices of various types and various spatial orientations (see Subsect. 2.2). Of

course, while describing a crystal, it is necessary to consider in the statistical sum only the

states associated with one type and one orientation of the lattice. Then for each phase we

obtain N(E) = 1 and S = 0 at T = 0, i.e., the Nernst theorem is satisﬁed. However, if the
lowest state of a real ﬁnite crystal is j-fold degenerate, we obtain for it S(T = 0) = kB ln(j).

the GS energy of a crystal by 0.6 K higher, than E0 of a liquid. In this case, liquid and solid
helium have densities of 0.1725 g/cm3 [106, 109] and 0.191 g/cm3 [108, 109], respectively. To
verify the basic inequality (24), we need to compare E0 of liquid and solid helium at the
same ρ. We can determine E0 of liquid helium at ρ = 0.191 g/cm3 by the known formula

However, such data are not available, since He II does not exist at such densities: it solidiﬁes.

It is signiﬁcant that GS of liquid helium at the crystallization pressure (P

25 atm) has a

lower energy, than GS of a crystal. Nevertheless, liquid helium crystallizes. The reason is
known and is as follows. 4He possesses large zero oscillations. Therefore, at low pressures,
the crystal is unstable. As a result, the system at low pressures and temperatures is in the

≈

state of underliquid. This is He II. As the pressure increases, the ratio of the amplitude
of zero oscillations to the lattice period decreases [9, 110]. At P >
25 atm, the crystal
∼
embryos become stable and liquid 4He crystallizes [111, 112]. In this case, the formation of
microcrystals and the external pressure make the liquid state unstable: the external pressure
compresses the system, performs the work, and increases the energy of the system up to E0

of a crystal. This results in the formation of a crystal. By such a scenario, the ground state
of 4He at P > 25 atm corresponds to a liquid, but this state cannot be obtained. However,
the crystallization pressure should rise above 25 atm provided we prevent the formation of

crystal nuclei (one needs to purify helium from impurities and use the smooth walls with a

microstructure diﬀerent from the structure of a helium crystal). We do not know whether

attempts to obtain high-density liquid helium in this way were made before. If He II with
ρ = 0.1725–0.191 g/cm3 could be obtained, it would be possible to verify inequality (24) for
ρ = 0.191 g/cm3.

The analytic analysis of crystalline solutions is very complicated. Therefore, the majority

of theoretical studies of quantum crystals were executed numerically by the Monte Carlo (MC)

method (see works [7, 8, 21, 22, 33, 40, 48, 49, 50, 55, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120,

121, 122, 123] and reviews [11, 35, 36, 124]; an introduction to the MC methods can be found

in books [125, 126]). Some MC methods are “exact” and are independent of (by authors’

opinion) a trial function [8, 21, 40, 50, 113, 114, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123]. However,

the “exact” MC simulations do not give an analytic solution for WF. Therefore, the authors

believed that the solution corresponds to a nodeless WF of a crystal, by basing on indirect

signs. Usually, such sign is simply the density of the system equal to the experimental density

of the crystal [8, 33, 48, 49, 115, 117, 119]. Sometimes, the authors distinguished a liquid
solution and a crystalline one by trial WFs [8, 21, 22, 114, 116], the inequality Ec

crystal from a liquid, namely, the anisotropy of solutions, was studied only in a few works

[40, 50, 114, 118, 121, 122, 123] (solutions for the classical system of hard balls see in [128]).

By means of the symmetry analysis we have shown in Sect. 2 that the genuine GS must

correspond to a liquid for any density. The symmetry analysis is a more strong argument,

than a MC simulation. Since the former presents the exact information, whereas the latter

gives only an approximate one. Therefore, we suppose that the MC simulations gave always a

nodeless liquid solution or a crystalline solution corresponding to a WF with nodes (instead of
r2) was obtained
a nodeless crystalline solution). In particular, the isotropic function g2(r1 −

With the help of the shadow PIGS (path integral ground state) MC method, the authors of

work [118] obtained a crystal-like distribution of atoms. Within an analogous method the

solutions for 2D and 3D crystals were obtained in [50] and [40], respectively. The crystal
character of a solution was determined by the Bragg peak of the structural factor S(ky)
[50] or S(k) [40]. We think that works [40, 50, 118, 121, 122, 123] present the crystalline

solutions corresponding to a local crystalline energy minimum (see Fig. 1) and WFs with

nodes. As far as we understand, the Green’s function MC [114, 116], PIGS MC [40, 50, 118],

PIMC [121, 122], and a diﬀusion MC [123] are “exact” methods, but they do not allow one

to reliably clarify whether the obtained WF has nodes.

In works [40, 50], no comparison

of the parameters of the Bragg peak and the lattice parameters was made. It is worth to

verify whether the lattice is one-dimensional (this would explain the smallness of the quantity

Usually, the MC simulations lead to the crystalline solution at a suﬃciently high concen-

one can try to take it oﬀ this minimum by increasing the step of simulation by one order

of magnitude or by starting a new simulation with a small step using the previous or new

trial function. The “exact” MC simulations usually give information that is insuﬃcient to

reliably determine the lattice type and to clarify whether the crystal WF is nodeless. For

the determination of a type and dimensionality of the lattice, one needs to ﬁnd the function

We hope that the modern capabilities of computers and theory are suﬃcient to perform the

detailed studies and to clarify the general picture with the help of MC simulations.

8 Appendix 4. Formation of nuclei

The theory of formation of nuclei of a new phase is not completed (especially, the theory of

crystallization), but its general contours are apparently clear (see reviews [98, 130] and books

[86, 99, 100, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138]). The nuclei of the other phase can be

created on the walls of a vessel and in bulk. We will consider only the simpler bulk case.

The bulk condensation of a gas into a crystal or liquid occurs under the avalanche-like

if P or T
increase in the number of nuclei of the new phase. Such growth is possible,
diﬀers from the value P = P∞ or T = T∞ corresponding to the condition of equilibrium
(27). Consider a gas at low P = P∞ and low T = T∞. Let us compress it isothermally

where n is the concentration of atoms in a droplet, P∞ is the saturated vapor pressure, αlg
is the coeﬃcient of surface tension of a liquid on the boundary with a gas. Let the pressure
Pr correspond to the radius r = r0, according to (58). Then the droplets of radius r < r0
must evaporate. The condensation of atoms of a gas on a droplet decreases the pressure in a
gas, which makes it possible for the droplets of radius r > r0 to exist. As a result, the mean
radius of droplets must increase with the time, until the whole gas transforms into one large

drop [95]. The crystal embryos in a gas can be described analogously. We will get formula

(58), where the parameters of a microdrop should be replaced by those of a microcrystal.

According to a more detailed theory, the process of formation of embryos is as follows

[100, 130, 131, 134, 135, 136, 137]. The ﬂuctuations in a gas result in the spontaneous

formation of microscopic embryos of a liquid (microdrops) and a crystal (microcrystals) in a

gas. The embryo can randomly capture atoms of the gas, which will lead to the growth of this

embryo. The reverse process is possible as well. As a result, some (non-stationary, generally

speaking) distribution of embryos over sizes should be formed.

In this case, the embryos

of sizes larger than the critical one (Eq. (58)) must unboundedly grow. Such embryos are

usually called nuclei.

If the system is supplied with a gas in the amount compensating

the loss due to the formation of nuclei, we get a stationary distribution of nuclei and the

continuous transformation of small nuclei into large ones. If such pumping of a gas is absent,

then in the usual case (isothermal formation of nuclei in a closed system with permanent

supersaturation) the non-stationary process eventually becomes stationary [136, 137, 138].

Therefore, we may consider the process to be stationary. The kinetic analysis shows that, in

this case, the rate J of homogeneous (i.e., without exterior impurities) formation of nuclei is

[98, 99, 100, 131, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138]

J = ngBe− W

(59)

where ng is the gas concentration, B is the kinetic factor (which can depend on P and T ),
W > 0 is the work of formation of a critical nucleus (an embryo of such size for which W

is maximum at the given P and T ). Condition (58) yields the radius of such a nucleus as a
function of P = Pr at T = T∞ = const. Frequently, the dependence of the critical radius r
on T at P = P∞ = const is studied. Then [100, 134]

It is diﬃcult to calculate the value of B in (59). Diﬀerent models give diﬀerent values.

Within the classical approach (high T and large nuclei), J. Gibbs [86] found W for a critical

liquid nucleus,

and for a critical crystal nucleus,

Wl = ςαlg/3,

Wc =

(62)

Here, ς = 4πr2 is the droplet surface area, j is the number of a crystal face, ςj is the area of
the j-th face of a crystal, and αj is the coeﬃcient of surface tension for the j-th face of the
crystal which contacts with the gas. It is useful to write formula (62) in the form [99]

Wc = ς ¯αcg/3,

(63)

where ¯αcg is the average coeﬃcient of surface tension of the crystal on the boundary with the
gas, and ς is the area of a sphere with the volume equal to that of a crystalline nucleus. At
T = T∞ and P = P∞, the radius of a critical nucleus is r =
which corresponds to the equilibrium of phases.

. Therefore, J turns to zero,

∞

Apparently, the underliquid can be obtained easier by means of the isothermal compression

of a gas, than by its isobaric cooling. We now consider only the ﬁrst way. The modern theory

cannot exactly conclude whether the compressed gas will turn into a liquid or a crystal. This

is not surprising, because the process of transition of one phase into another one is complex

and depends on many factors.

First, we note that W is less at the condensation of a gas on the surface, than at the

condensation in bulk [130, 131, 132, 135, 137]. In particular, the work of formation of a dome-
shaped critical nucleus (liquid or crystalline) of radius r0 on a solid wall is [131, 132, 135, 138]

W 2D = (ςα/12)[2 + cos θ][1

cos θ]2,

(64)

−
where ς = 4πr2
0, θ is the angle between the nucleus surface and the wall, α is the surface
tension of the nucleus that is in contact with a gas. At the complete nonwetting (θ = π),
the value of W 2D = ςα/3 coincides with that of the bulk work W (61) or (63).
If the
wetting is present (θ < π), then W 2D < Wl, Wc, and a nucleus can be easier formed on
the wall, than in bulk. Of course, crystallization is a complex process that is not reduced

to the formation of dome-like nuclei. However, formula (64) shows that a crystal nucleus

can be easier formed on the surface, than in bulk [99, 131, 134, 135, 137]. Therefore, if the

gas contains solid impurities (or the walls of a vessel contain some inhomogeneities able to

become the centers of condensation), then the surface condensation, rather than the bulk

one, is realized. In practice, the impurities and inhomogeneities of walls are usually present.
Moreover, W 2D
l < Wl even for the ideally smooth wall provided θ < π. Therefore, the
condensation of a gas usually occurs on the walls or on impurity particles.

According to experiments, at T < T3 a gas condenses into a crystal. This is because the

from impurity particles and the vessel with very smooth walls is used.

In addition, the

microstructure of walls of a vessel should be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the microstructure

of a crystal, into which the gas can condense. Under these conditions, the condensation of a

gas into a liquid (on the walls or in bulk) should be dominant.

Assume that the bulk homogeneous mechanism of spontaneous formation of nuclei is

realized.

In this case, crystalline and liquid nuclei will arise. The rate of each of these

processes is given by formula (59), where W is determined by formulae (61) or (63). It is

For the surface mechanism of formation of nuclei, the formulae are signiﬁcantly more
complicated, especially for crystalline nuclei. In the last case, the work Wc depends also on
the relationship of the crystalline structures of a nucleus and the substrate [98, 130, 131, 133,
135, 137]. We did not make estimates for this case. Most likely, the ratio P/P cg

atoms of a gas interact weakly with atoms of the walls, then the bulk formation of nuclei

(drops or crystals) should be more intense, as compared with the formation of nuclei on the

walls.

Our analysis is rather crude, but the main conclusions are apparently qualitatively right.

at several diﬀerent temperatures T

Thus, the experiment on gas compression should be carried out with diﬀerent walls of vessels
T3. The condensation of a gas into a liquid has to be
more probable than the crystallization, provided that (i) the microstructures of the wall and

crystal nuclei are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (or atoms of the gas interact weakly with atoms of the

wall and relation (67) holds) and (ii) the gas is puriﬁed from impurities. Condition (i) can

be fulﬁlled by covering the internal surfaces of the walls of a vessel with a solid amorphous

substance [97, 98] or with a microlayer of helium-II. Perhaps, this is the simplest way to

obtain the underliquid.
