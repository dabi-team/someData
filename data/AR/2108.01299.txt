Magnetic Flux and Magnetic Non-potentiality of Active Regions
in Eruptive and Conﬁned Solar Flares

ABSTRACT

With the aim of understanding how the magnetic properties of active regions
(ARs) control the eruptive character of solar ﬂares, we analyze 719 ﬂares of
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) class ≥C5.0 during
2010−2019. We carry out the ﬁrst statistical study that investigates the ﬂare-
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) association rate as function of the ﬂare intensity
and the AR characteristics that produces the ﬂare, in terms of its total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux (ΦAR). Our results show that the slope of the ﬂare-CME association
rate with ﬂare intensity reveals a steep monotonic decrease with ΦAR. This means
that ﬂares of the same GOES class but originating from an AR of larger ΦAR, are
much more likely conﬁned. Based on an AR ﬂux as high as 1.0×1024 Mx for solar-
type stars, we estimate that the CME association rate in X100-class “superﬂares”
is no more than 50%. For a sample of 132 ﬂares ≥M2.0 class, we measure three
non-potential parameters including the length of steep gradient polarity inversion
line (LSGP IL), the total photospheric free magnetic energy (Ef ree) and the area
with large shear angle (AΨ). We ﬁnd that conﬁned ﬂares tend to have larger
values of LSGP IL, Ef ree and AΨ compared to eruptive ﬂares. Each non-potential
parameter shows a moderate positive correlation with ΦAR. Our results imply
that ΦAR is a decisive quantity describing the eruptive character of a ﬂare, as
it provides a global parameter relating to the strength of the background ﬁeld
conﬁnement.

Introduction

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most catastrophic phenomena in
the present solar system, driven by a sudden release of magnetic energy stored in the solar
corona. Large solar ﬂares are often, but not always, associated with CMEs. We dub ﬂares
with a CME “eruptive” and ﬂares without a CME “conﬁned” (Moore et al. 2001). There
are two main factors that are considered to determine whether a ﬂare event is CME-eruptive
or not. One factor is the constraining eﬀect of the background magnetic ﬁeld overlying the
ﬂaring region, i.e., the strength of magnetic ﬁeld or its decay with height (Wang & Zhang
2007; Yang et al. 2014; Thalmann et al. 2015; Baumgartner et al. 2018). Li et al. (2020)
analyzed 322 large ﬂares and found that the ﬂare-CME association rate decreases with the
increasing magnetic ﬂux of the active region (AR) that produces the ﬂare, implying that
large magnetic ﬂux generally tends to conﬁne eruptions.

Another factor determining the eruptive character of solar ﬂares is thought to be related
to magnetic complexity and non-potentiality of ARs (Sun et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2016; Jing et
al. 2018; Duan et al. 2019), such as free magnetic energy, relative helicity, magnetic twists,
etc. Numerous statistical studies have revealed that strong ﬂares mostly occur in ARs with
a complex conﬁguration and high non-potentiality of magnetic ﬁelds (Mayﬁeld & Lawrence
1985; Falconer et al. 2002; Chen & Wang 2012, 2020; Su et al. 2014). However, there are
only a few statistical studies focusing on magnetic non-potential measures in conﬁned versus
eruptive ﬂares (Nindos & Andrews 2004; Cui et al. 2018; Vasantharaju et al. 2018). Nindos
& Andrews (2004) and Gupta et al. (2021) found that in a statistical sense the pre-ﬂare
coronal magnetic helicity of ARs producing conﬁned large ﬂares is smaller than that of ARs
producing eruptive large ﬂares. Bobra & Ilonidis (2016) used machine-learning algorithms
to predict CME productivity and found that the “intensive” parameters (those not scaling
with the AR size) distinguish between eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares. Until now, the key non-
potential parameters of ARs governing the eruptive character of solar ﬂares are still unknown
based on statistical results. Moreover, the access to open ﬂux (open to the interplanetary
space) is also thought to inﬂuence whether an X-class ﬂare is likely to be eruptive (DeRosa
& Barnes 2018).

In this Letter, we carry out the ﬁrst statistical study that investigates the ﬂare-CME
association rate R as a function of the AR characteristics that produces the ﬂare, in terms
of its total magnetic ﬂux (ΦAR). Our ﬁndings reveal clear diﬀerences of R, with the slope

– 3 –

of R as function of ﬂare intensity being a monotonically decreasing function of ΦAR. This
result has important implications for the prediction of CMEs occurring in association with
large ﬂares as well as for the solar-stellar connection, where the solar ﬂare-CME association
rates are used to estimate stellar CME occurrence frequencies. Moreover, we also ﬁnd the
distinct diﬀerences of non-potential parameters characterizing ARs in eruptive and conﬁned
large ﬂares.

2. Observational Data and Analysis

2.1. Data and Event Selection

We check for the soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂare catalog recorded by the Geostationary Op-
erational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system and select ﬂare events ≥C5.0 occurring
within 45◦ from the central meridian, from June 2010 to June 2019. A total of 719 events are
selected, including 322 M-class (Li et al. 2020) and 397 C-class ﬂares. To determine whether
a ﬂare is associated with a CME, we use the CME catalog1 of the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO)/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et
al. 1995). The observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) and the twin
Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO; Kaiser et al. 2008; Howard et al. 2008)
are also used to help determining the CME association (see detailed description in Li et al.
2020). Out of these 719 ﬂares, 251 events are eruptive and 468 are conﬁned (see Table 1 and
the database FlareC5.02). For each event, we calculated ΦAR before the ﬂare onset (within
30 min) by using the available vector magnetograms from Space-Weather Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) AR Patches (SHARP; Bobra et al. 2014).
Only pixels that host a radial component of the magnetic ﬁeld |Br|>100 G are considered
(Kazachenko et al. 2017).

2.2. Calculation of Magnetic Non-potential Parameters of ARs

For a subset of 132 ﬂare events ≥M2.0 (86 eruptive and 46 conﬁned), we calculated
three non-potential parameters before the ﬂare onset (within 30 min) including the length of
polarity-inversion lines (PILs) with steep horizontal magnetic gradient (LSGP IL), the total

– 4 –

photospheric free magnetic energy (Ef ree) and the area with strong magnetic shear (AΨ).
Magnetic PILs mark the separation between positive and negative magnetic ﬂux in the pho-
tosphere of ARs. Properties of PILs in ARs have been found to be strongly correlated to
solar ﬂare and CME occurrences (Falconer et al. 2002; Vasantharaju et al. 2018; Kon-
togiannis et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2020). High-gradient, strong-ﬁeld PILs are proxies of
(near-)photospheric compact electrical currents and the occurrence of major ﬂares was often
associated with the emergence of ﬂux with high-gradient, strong-ﬁeld PILs (Schrijver 2007;
Toriumi & Wang 2019). According to the method of Chen & Wang (2012), we measured
the length of the PILs with a steep horizontal magnetic gradient (≥ 300 G Mm−1) for each
ﬂare event based on the SHARP vector magnetograms.

The energy that is released during a ﬂare is generally believed to originate from the free
magnetic energy stored primarily in ARs, which is the amount of magnetic energy in excess
of the minimum energy attributed to the potential ﬁeld (Molodensky 1974). It was found
that the higher the free magnetic energy stored in an AR, the larger the size (magnitude) of
upcoming ﬂares (Jing et al. 2010; Su et al. 2014). We use a proxy for the total photospheric
free magnetic energy (Wang et al. 1996; Chen & Wang 2012), which can be calculated as

Ef ree = Σρf reedA,

(1)

where ρf ree is a proxy for the density of the free magnetic energy in the photosphere, deﬁned
as

ρf ree =

|Bo − Bp|2
8π

,

(2)

where Bo and Bp are the observed and the potential magnetic ﬁelds, respectively. Bp was
derived from the observed Br component using the Fourier transform method. ρf ree and
Ef ree are in units of [erg cm−3] and [erg cm−1], respectively. We measured Ef ree by only
considering the pixels with ρf ree ≥4.0×104 erg cm−3.

Magnetic shear, deﬁned as the angular diﬀerence between the measured ﬁeld and the
calculated potential ﬁeld, is another commonly used parameter in describing the magnetic
complexity and non-potentiality (Wang et al. 1994; Zhang et al. 2007). We measured the
area with shear angle ≥80◦, AΨ (Chen & Wang 2012). The shear angle is given by

Ψ = arccos

3. Statistical Results

3.1. Relations of Flare-CME Association Rate with Flare Intensity and

Magnetic Flux of ARs

We investigate the ﬂare-CME association rate R as function of both the ﬂare class
and the total ﬂux of the source AR for 719 ﬂares (≥C5.0 class). Figure 1(a) shows the
scatter plot of ΦAR versus ﬂare peak SXR ﬂux (FSXR). Blue (red) circles are the eruptive
(conﬁned) ﬂares. Obviously, when ΦAR is large enough (>1.0×1023 Mx; black dashed line),
an overwhelming majority (about 97%) of ﬂares do not generate CMEs (57 of 59 ﬂares are
conﬁned). Out of the ﬂare events of ΦAR>1.0×1023 Mx (a total of 59 events), 32 ﬂares
occurred in AR 12192, the huge AR known as ﬂare-rich but CME-poor (Sun et al. 2015),
and the fraction is about 54%. If we remove the events in AR 12192, almost all the events
are conﬁned (26 of 27 ﬂares are conﬁned).

The value of ΦAR for the 719 ﬂares ranges from 8.5×1021 Mx to 2.3×1023 Mx, and we
divide ΦAR into ﬁve subintervals. Figure 1(b) shows the relations of the association rate R
with FSXR within the ﬁve ΦAR subintervals. For each subinterval, R clearly increases with
FSXR. Each straight line in Figure 1(b) shows the linear ﬁt

R = α log FSXR + β,

(4)

where R is in percentage and FSXR is in units of W m−2. For the smallest ΦAR subinterval (≤
2.0×1022 Mx), the slope α is 113.8±13.1 and R reaches 100% when the ﬂare is >M1.3 class
(red straight line). For the subinterval of 2.0<ΦAR≤3.5×1022 Mx, the slope α decreases
to 82.0±10.6 (green straight line).
It can be seen that in ARs with a small ΦAR, about
50% C5.0-class ﬂares have associated CMEs. For the moderate ΦAR subintervals (blue and
orange lines), the slopes α are 48.2±5.4 and 38.4±6.3, respectively. The Spearman rank
order correlation coeﬃcients rs are 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. In ARs with the largest ΦAR
(> 9.0×1022 Mx), R decreases signiﬁcantly when compared to subintervals characterized by
smaller ΦAR (black straight line; also see Table 1). The relation between R and FSXR in the
largest ΦAR subinterval is

R = (22.9 ± 3.8) log FSXR + (125.7 ± 17.9).

(5)

Based on Eq. 5, only 20% of all M-class ﬂares originating from the largest ARs have associ-
ated CMEs and the rate R reaches about 40% for ﬂares >X2. Almost all of C5.0-class ﬂares
are conﬁned due to the strong constraining ﬁelds in the largest ARs.

Figure 1(c) shows the relation of the slope α with ΦAR. ΦAR is here deﬁned as the
mean of the individual log values in each ΦAR subinterval. The plot shows that the slope

– 6 –

α decreases monotonically with increasing ΦAR. We assume ARs in solar-type stars of ΦAR
∼ 1.0×1024 Mx (Maehara et al. 2012; Shibata et al. 2013). For there are only ﬁve known
slope values, it is diﬃcult to ﬁt the plot and make an extrapolation. We use the slope in
the largest solar ARs, i.e., 22.9, minus the average error estimate of ﬁve known slope values
(∼7.8, corresponding to the average error of ﬁve diamonds), that is 22.9 minus 7.8 equals
15.1 as the slope α for stellar ARs of ΦAR ∼ 1.0×1024 Mx. We estimate that the slope α
might be no more than 15.1±7.8 (red circle). If C5.0-class ﬂares are all conﬁned on solar-type
stars (similar to the subinterval of ΦAR > 9.0×1022 Mx), we can extrapolate the ﬂare-CME
association rate for solar-type stars is given as

R = (15.1 ± 7.8) log FSXR + 80.0.

(6)

Thus, for X100-class superﬂares in solar-type stars, the estimated association rate R is no
more than 50%.

3.2. Magnetic Non-potentiality of ARs in Eruptive and Conﬁned Flares

We calculate three non-potential parameters for 132 ﬂares ≥M2.0. Figure 2 shows an
example of an eruptive X2.2-class ﬂare occurring on 2011 February 15 in AR NOAA 11158.
The SGPIL is located between two ﬂare ribbons, and the distributions of the photospheric
free energy density ρf ree and shear angle Ψ show similar patterns. In Figure 3, we display
the scatter plots and histograms of the three non-potential measures for the whole set of 132
ﬂare events. It can be seen that the distributions of LSGP IL show evident diﬀerences between
conﬁned and eruptive cases (Figures 3(a)-(b)). For LSGP IL<22 Mm (black dash-dotted line
in Figure 3(a)), an overwhelming majority (about 90%) of ﬂares are eruptive. The log-mean
value of LSGP IL for conﬁned ﬂares is 40.2 Mm (red dotted line in panel (b)), much larger
than that for eruptive events (20.8 Mm, blue dotted line in panel (b)). The distributions of
Ef ree are similar to those of LSGP IL. For Ef ree <1.5×1023 erg cm−1 (black dash-dotted line
in Figure 3(c)), 48 in 58 ﬂares are eruptive. For AΨ<60 Mm2, about 79% (30 in 38) ﬂares
are eruptive (Figure 3(e)). The log-mean values of Ef ree and AΨ for conﬁned ﬂares are much
larger than those for eruptive events (Figures 3(d) and (f)).

In Figure 4, we investigate the relationship between the three non-potential parameters
and ΦAR in Figure 4. It can be seen that each two non-potential parameters have strong
correlations at rs ∼ 0.69−0.85 (Figures 4(a)-(c)). The high correlation coeﬃcients between
LSGP IL, Ef ree and AΨ imply that ARs with long SGPIL tend to store more free magnetic
energy and have strong shearing. The scatter plot of LSGP IL with ΦAR illustrates that they
have a moderate correlation at rs ∼ 0.4 (Figure 4(d)). About 89% of the conﬁned ﬂares occur

– 7 –

in ARs with ΦAR > 3.5×1022 Mx and SGPIL longer than 22 Mm. Moderate correlations were
also obtained for Ef ree versus ΦAR and AΨ versus ΦAR (Figures 4(e)-4(f)). Their moderate
correlations with ΦAR indicate that there is some trend that the more magnetic ﬂux of an
AR, the higher non-potentiality of the AR.

4. Summary and Discussion

In this study, we have examined 719 ﬂares ≥C5.0-class that were observed on-disk from
June 2010 to June 2019. We investigate for the ﬁrst time the ﬂare-CME association rate
R as function of both the ﬂare class FSXR and the total ﬂux ΦAR of the AR that produces
the ﬂare. We ﬁnd that, for each ΦAR subinterval, R clearly increases with FSXR, i.e., larger
ﬂares are more likely associated with a CME. This result is in agreement with previous
ﬁndings studying CME-ﬂare association rates (Andrews 2003; Yashiro et al. 2006), who
reported overall CME associations of about 60% for M-class ﬂares and 90% for X-class
ﬂares. However, what is new and particularly important in our study is that we considered
not only the relation to the intensity of the ﬂare but also to the characteristics of the
AR in terms of its total magnetic ﬂux. Our results show that the slope of the ﬂare-CME
association rate depends on the total ﬂux of the AR that produces the ﬂare, and reveals a
steep monotonic decrease with ΦAR (Figure 1(c)). This means that ﬂares of the same GOES
class but originating from an AR of larger ΦAR, are much more likely conﬁned. Within the
smallest ΦAR subinterval (≤ 2.0×1022 Mx), all ﬂares >M1.3 are all eruptive. On the other
end of the distribution for the largest ΦAR subinterval (> 9.0×1022 Mx), only about 20%
M-class ﬂares have associated CMEs and the association rate R reaches about 40% for those
ﬂares >X2.

Our results imply that ΦAR is a key factor determining the eruptive character of solar
ﬂares, consistent with our previous studies (Li et al. 2020). ΦAR can be considered to be
both a measure of the total ﬂux that is in principle available for ﬂaring as well as being a
measure of the background ﬁeld conﬁnement overlying the ﬂaring region. Our ﬁndings imply
that the latter is the more important factor here. Large ΦAR means a strong conﬁnement
and thus the ﬂare-CME association rate is relatively low compared to small ΦAR. Moreover,
based on solar observations, we can speculate the associate rate R on solar-type stars by
assuming ΦAR of 1.0×1024 Mx (Maehara et al. 2012; Shibata et al. 2013). For X100-class
“superﬂares” on solar-type stars, no more than 50% ﬂares can generate stellar CMEs. This
may provide an explanation why the detection of stellar CMEs is rare (e.g. Leitzinger et
al. 2014, Vida et al. 2019, Argiroﬃ et al. 2019, Moschou et al. 2019, Veronig et al. 2021),
while extrapolating current ﬂare-CME relations to solar-type stars leads to unphysically

– 8 –

high CME rates (Drake et al. 2013; Odert et al. 2017). Our ﬁndings provide an important
contribution to revise the ﬂare-CME association rates for solar-type stars, by including the
distinct diﬀerences in these relations in dependence of the AR magnetic ﬂux.

Using HMI vector magnetograms, we also have studied the relation between the degree
of magnetic non-potentiality and the eruptive character of 132 ﬂares ≥M2.0, ﬁnding distinct
diﬀerences between eruptive and conﬁned ﬂares for all three non-potentiality parameters
derived (Figures 3-4). LSGP IL, Ef ree and AΨ all give smaller log-mean values for eruptive
than non-eruptive ﬂares. Each non-potential parameter shows a moderate correlation with
ΦAR. Our study shows that the three “extensive” parameters (those scaling with the AR
size) can only discriminate the ﬂares with small non-potential parameters. As seen in Figure
3, 42 out of 47 events with LSGP IL<22 Mm are eruptive. However, for the remanent 85 ﬂares
with LSGP IL>22 Mm, it is diﬃcult to tell whether a ﬂare is accompanied by a CME or not.
The appearance of other two parameters is similar to that of LSGP IL. Only a fraction of ﬂare
events can be discriminated between conﬁned and eruptive events. Thus we speculate that if
we use these “extensive” parameters to predict the CME productivity, the True Skill Score
(TSS) value is not high. This is consistent with the study of Bobra & Ilonidis (2016), who
shows that TSS for predicting the CME productivity is low based on “extensive” parameters.
They show that “intensive” parameters can predict the CME productivity. In our study, we
did not calculate “intensive” parameters. In our future work, we will consider “intensive”
parameters in conﬁned and eruptive large ﬂares based on our database.

In the statistical results of Cui et al. (2018), conﬁned ﬂares have larger values of ΦAR
and the gradient-weighted area of the polarity inversion region than eruptive ﬂares, which
are in agreement with our results. It was found that large conﬁned ﬂares tend to occur in
large ARs (Toriumi et al. 2017; Li et al. 2020), and thus LSGP IL, Ef ree and AΨ are larger for
conﬁned than eruptive ﬂares due to their positive correlations with ΦAR. Our results imply
that ΦAR is a key factor in determining whether a ﬂare is eruptive or conﬁned, as it provides
a global parameter relating to the strength of the background ﬁeld conﬁnement.

Fig. 1.— Relations of ﬂare-CME association rate (R) with ﬂare peak soft X-ray ﬂux (FSXR)
and total unsigned magnetic ﬂux of ARs (ΦAR). (a) Scatter plots of ΦAR vs. FSXR. Blue
(red) circles are the eruptive (conﬁned) ﬂares (≥ C5.0-class). Black dashed line corresponds
to ΦAR of 1.0×1023 Mx. (b) Association rate R as a function of FSXR separately for ﬁve
diﬀerent subintervals of ΦAR. The colored straight lines show the results of linear ﬁtting, and
slopes α and Spearman rank order correlation coeﬃcients rs are shown at the bottom right.
(c) Plot of slope α vs. ΦAR (plotted at the average of the log values in each subinterval).
Colored diamonds denote the slopes α in ﬁve diﬀerent ΦAR subintervals. The red circle is
the estimated value of slope α (about 15.1) for solar-type stars by assuming ΦAR of 1.0×1024
Mx (Maehara et al. 2012; Shibata et al. 2013).
