ABSTRACT

After performing the morpho-kinematic analysis of the planetary nebula (PN) PC 22, we
now present its nebular and stellar analysis. The plasma investigation relies on the novel use of
a Monte Carlo analysis associated to the PYNEB code for the uncertainty propagation. The in-
nermost region of the nebula shows electronic temperatures Te ≈ 10,800 K using [N II] and ≈
13,000 K using [O III] and electronic densities ne ≈ 600 cm−3. We also used for the ﬁrst time
a Machine Learning Algorithm to calculate Ionisation Correction Factors (ICFs) speciﬁcally
adapted to PC 22. This has allowed us to have pioneer ICFs for (S+ + S++)/O++, Cl++/O++,
and Ar3++Ar4+, as well as a possible new determination for the total abundance of neon. The
study of the stellar spectrum revealed the presence of broad emission lines consistent with a
Wolf-Rayet-type [WR] classiﬁcation and more precisely a [WO1]-subtype based on different
qualitative and quantitative criteria. This classiﬁcation is also coherent with the high stellar
temperature derived from the reproduction of the ionization state of the gas with the Mexi-
can Million Models database (3MdB) and the best ﬁt model obtained with the NLTE model
atmosphere code PoWR. PC 22 is therefore a new addition to the [WO1]-subtype PNe.

INTRODUCTION

In a previous work, Sabin, et al. (2017, hereafter Paper I) performed
the morpho-kinematics analysis of the planetary nebula (PN) PC 22
and classiﬁed it as an evolved starﬁsh with fast outﬂows. The deep
imaging used for the morphological analysis also revealed an inter-
esting spatial distribution for the [O III] λ 5007 nebular emission.
The latter appeared as the dominant emission line not only in the
central part of the PN, but also in its outermost regions, i.e. the faint
lobes, therefore probing the high excitation state of PC 22. This PN
could therefore be compared to other highly ionised objects such
as NGC 6309 (Rubio, et al. 2015), NGC 6905 (Cuesta, Phillips
& Mampaso 1993; Gómez-González et al. 2022) and NGC 6058
(Guillén, et al. 2013) for example.

In this second part of our investigation of PC 22 we use op-
tical long slit spectroscopic observations of its nebular and stellar

components to determine the chemical abundances of the PN and to
characterise its central star (CSPN). Amongst the highlights of this
paper is also the ﬁrst time application of the Mexican Million Mod-
els database (3MdB, Morisset, Delgado-Inglada & Flores-Fajardo
2015) coupled with a Machine Learning Algorithm to study the
PN plasma (i.e. electronic temperatures and densities, ionic and
elemental abundances). With this information it will therefore be
possible to obtain a comprehensive analysis of PC 22, but also to
perform some comparative studies with other high excitation PNe.
The article is organized as follows. The observations are pre-
sented in section §2. The results of the nebular and stellar anal-
ysis are shown in §3 and §4, respectively. Finally our discussion
and concluding remarks are presented in section §5 and §6, respec-
tively.

2 OBSERVATIONS

Long-slit intermediate resolution optical spectroscopic observa-
tions of PC 22 were performed on July 19, 2015 with the Alhambra
Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (ALFOSC) mounted on the
2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) at the Roque de los Mucha-
chos Observatory (ORM, La Palma, Spain). The detector was an
E2V 42-40 2k×2k CCD with pixel size 15 µm, providing a plate
scale of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)2138 pixel−1 and a ﬁeld of view (FoV) of 6.(cid:48)3×6.(cid:48)3.
The grism #7, providing a dispersion of 1.7Å pixel−1, was used
in conjunction with the grism #14, which provides a dispersion of
1.6Å pixel−1. The use of both grisms allowed a total coverage from
3200Å to 7110Å. The slit length matches the FoV and a slit width
of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)55 was selected. This slit width provides a spectral resolution
of ∆λ = 4.1Å for the grism #7 and ∆λ = 3.8Å for the grism #14.

The slit was placed along the bright internal elliptical struc-
ture’s minor axis of PC 22 at position angle (PA) of 133◦ (see
Fig. 1). This slit allows us to analyse the external outﬂows and in-
ternal bright elliptical structure of PC 22, as well as its CSPN. The
exposure time was set to 2×1500s with grism #7 and 2×600s with
grism #14.

The data reduction was performed following standard proce-
dures with IRAF and includes bias subtraction, ﬂat-ﬁelding, wave-
length calibration with a helium-neon arc lamp and ﬁnally ﬂux cal-
ibration using the standard star Feige 110.

3 NEBULAR ANALYSIS

We identiﬁed and extracted ﬁve nebular zones along the minor axis
of the internal elliptical structure of PC 22 using the IRAF task
apall (Fig. 1). Two of these regions are located inside the main
elliptical structure (named R2 and R4) and three correspond to the
opposite outﬂows (named R1, R5 and R6). The central star (R3)
has also been extracted and its analysis is presented in section §4.
The presence of strong He II λ 4686 emission in the whole
nebular spectrum of PC 22 denotes a highly excited nebula. The
hydrogen Balmer lines are therefore likely to be affected by the
contribution from unresolved He II Pickering lines. We calculated
an average contamination level of 6% on the basis of Brocklehurst
(1971)’s theoretical Balmer line ratios. The corrective procedure,
mostly valid for the regions R2 and R4 (see below), does not affect
the extinction measurement but can impact the abundances deter-
mination (if not performed).

3.1 The faint outﬂows

Table 1 indicates that the spatially most extreme regions, corre-
sponding to the South-East and North-West outﬂows (R1, R5 and
R6) present a relatively scarce number of emission lines. Hence,
for the regions R1 and R5 we only detected the Balmer lines Hα
and Hβ , as well as [N II] λ 6584 (not in R1), [O III] λ λ 4959, 5007,
and interestingly He II λ 4686. Due to the faintness of the Hβ line,
the error on the extinction determination, using the Cardelli et al.
(1989) law with Rv=3.11, is large ((cid:62) 50%). The logarithmic extinc-
tion c(Hβ ) values for R1 and R5 show a large variation from 0.6 to
0.1 respectively.
In the case of the region R6, the Hβ line is absent and therefore im-
pedes the dereddening of the detected emission lines (i.e. Hα, [N II]
λ λ 6548, 6584 and [O III] λ λ 4959, 5007). We therefore chose not
to include this region in Table 1 although it is worth noting though
that if we consider Hα=100, [O III] λ 5007 = 1140±130.

As inferred from the analysis of the images in Paper I, the
[O III] λ 5007 line is dominant and we now quantify that it is up to
15.5 times the Hβ value. The outﬂows also display a high ioniza-
tion degree with He II λ 4686 to Hβ ratios of 1.2 and 1.6 in R1 and
R5, respectively. The high value in the latter could be associated to
the presence of a denser ﬁlamentary area. The tip of the North-West
outﬂow (R6) does not show this emission at all. It was not possible
to derive the electronic temperatures (Te) and densities (ne) in these
external regions due to the lack of appropriate diagnostic emission
lines, nor was it possible to obtain the chemical abundances.

3.2 The bright elliptical structure

Based on Table 1, most of the emission is seen in the internal re-
gions, namely R2 and R4, which correspond to the bright central
regions of PC 22. The determination of c(Hβ ) for the two regions
is obtained from their respective Hα/Hβ line ratio and we found an
identical value of 0.32.
However, a careful analysis of both areas does not indicate sub-
stantial differences in terms of the presence of the different lines
identiﬁed and their ﬂuxes. We therefore decided to combine both
R2 and R4 spectra, and extract the emission lines again with apall.
The new results are shown in Table 2.

with PYNEB version 1.1.15b2. The atomic data used to determine
the ionic abundances are listed in Table 3.

3.2.1 Error propagation using a Monte Carlo analysis

We quadratically add 10% to the errors based on the noise close
to the lines, to take into account the additional uncertainties on the
various calibrations performed and to anticipate the uncertainties
on the atomic data used in the processes applied to the line intensi-
ties when deriving the abundances. To explore the uncertainty prop-
agation from the line intensities to the ﬁnal abundances, we adopt
a Monte Carlo (MC) based approach generating 5,000 artiﬁcial ob-
servations (above this number the statistics does not signiﬁcantly
change) with intensities following a normal distribution around the
observed uncorrected values with a standard deviation correspond-
ing to the uncertainty of each line. The MC is automatically done
using the addMonteCarloObs method of the Observations class
in PYNEB. Each emission line intensity is now a vector of 5,001
values (the ﬁrst one being the original observed value). We use
the uncorrected values to generate the MC data set, the redden-
ing correction being also a source of uncertainty. The pipeline used
to determine the electronic temperatures and densities (Te, ne), the
ionic abundances and the ﬁnal elemental abundances, described in
the following sections, is applied to each one of the 5,001 "ob-

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2021)

servations". The computation is made using the parallel mode of
PYNEB (pn.config.use_multiprocs()). In the following sec-
tions, we will refer to the values of physical parameters obtained
using the original observed intensities as the "original" method,
while the mean or median values as well as the standard deviations
are obtained from the MC distributions. We explored the effect of
the systematic 10% added to the line intensities by reducing this
value to 5%: all the derived parameters remain the same, the only
change being the standard deviation, reduced by 0.03 to 0.06 dex,
depending on the emission lines involved in their determination.

3.2.2 Logarithmic extinction c(Hβ )

To take into account uncertainties due to this reddening correction,
we compute the value of c(Hβ )α from only Hα/Hβ , and c(Hβ )αγδ
from the mean of the values determined from Hα/Hβ , Hγ/Hβ and
Hδ /Hβ . We then determine a coefﬁcient C uniformly randomly
distributed between 0 and 1 to compute the ﬁnal value as c(Hβ )
= C * c(Hβ )αγδ + (1-C) * c(Hβ )α . This procedure is applied for
each realisation of the 5000 MC observations. The resulting mean
value in our MC distribution for c(Hβ ) is 0.35± 0.13, correspond-
ing to Hα/Hβ = 2.95 ± 0.2. The "original" value of c(Hβ ) using
c(Hβ )αγδ is 0.28. We note that while the extinction factor Rv can

3.2.3 Te and ne diagnostics

First we present in Figure 2 the classical diagnostic diagram of the
"original" values, obtained with the Diagnostic.plot() method,
showing the intersections of the temperature-sensitive ( [O III]
λ λ 4363/4959+5007 and [N II] λ λ 5755/6548+6584) and density-
sensitive line ratios ([S II] λ λ 6731/6716, [Ar IV] λ λ 4740/4711 and
[Cl III] λ λ 5538/5518). We adopted a 2-regions description of the
plasma: a low ionization region where the [N II] and [S II] lines
arise, and a high ionization region emitting [O III], [Cl III] and
[Ar IV] lines. We present the results of the electron temperature and
density in the upper part of Table 4. We obtained electronic tem-

peratures of ≈10,900 K using [N II] and ≈13,000 K using [O III].
As the [O III] temperatures obtained with [Cl III] and [Ar IV] are
roughly identical, we adopted the mean value for the high ioniza-
tion region. From Figure 2 (or using getCrossTemDen PYNEB
method) we can determine the electron density for the 3 diagnos-
tics. They all indicate the same order of magnitude between 500
and 630 cm−3.

It is important to notice here that the high ionization density
diagnostics ([Cl III] and [Ar IV]) are both sensitive in a high density
range2, the ﬁrst one being efﬁcient between 103.4 and 105.2 cm−3,
while the second one is sensitive between 104.0 and 105.8 cm−3.
This implies that those two diagnostics are in principal not usable
for low density regions. Nevertheless, the density determined by
the 3 diagnostics being very similar, we will use ne([S II]) for the
low ionization region, and a mean of ne([Cl III]) and ne([Ar IV]) for
the high ionization region.

For the MC distribution, we indicate in Table 4 the mean, me-
dian and standard deviation of the distribution. As aforementioned,
the values obtained by applying the method to the original observed
intensities is called "original" method. In Figure 3 we show the MC
distribution and its median value for the electron temperature and
density. We observe that in the case of the electron density, the dis-
tribution is more symmetrical when using a logarithmic scale.

This procedure therefore indicates that the electronic tempera-
tures obtained with the mean and median are relatively equal to the
value obtained directly with the observed line ratios. In all cases
the standard deviation is small. Interestingly, we notice a high tem-
perature tail in the values determined from the pair [O III] - [Ar IV]
(Fig. 3, bottom left): they come from MC realisations correspond-
ing to low density. In the following, we will consider as the tem-
perature for the high ionization zone the mean of Te obtained from
the [O III] - [Cl III] and [O III] - [Ar IV] pairs. Once this mean value
is obtained, the tail at high Te is strongly reduced and does not
signiﬁcantly affect our main results.

The electronic densities derived with the MC method diverge
slightly from the "original" method for the highly ionised species.
Indeed, we can see in Figure 3 and Table 4 that the distributions for
[Cl III] and [Ar IV] are biased toward higher values than the ones
obtained directly from the observed line ratios. This is due to the
fact that those two diagnostics are less efﬁcient in the case of low
density gas. This effect would be even more important in case of
higher uncertainties on the line ratios. In all the cases the MC and
"original" methods are in very good agreement with ne ∼ 700 cm−3
within the errors.

3.2.4

Ionic abundances

The ionic abundances are calculated with the adopted Te [N II] or
Te [O III] based on the ionization potential, 30 eV being the thresh-
old between low and high excitation regions (see Table 4). Sim-
ilarly to the electronic temperature and density, we proceeded to
estimate the ionic abundances using the standard method as well
as a MC procedure (with the corresponding temperatures and den-
sities). The results are shown in the lower part of Table 4 and the

2 The density diagnostic line ratios are sensitive to density variations in
a range between the so-called low- and high-density limits. Outside this
range, the line ratios become insensitive to density variations. In this work
the have limited the use of density-sensitive line ratios to values correspond-
ing to 10% above the low-density limit and 10% below the high-density
limit. The values of the line ratios corresponding to those density ranges
have been obtained with the PYNEB method Atom.getDensityRange.

3.2.5

ICFs adapted to PC 22 using Machine Learning

To determine the elemental abundances from the ionic ones, the
ionic abundances obtained from the observations are added and
then a correction factor for the unseen ions is applied, the so-called
Ionisation Correction Factor (ICF). The ﬁrst ICFs were derived
from similarities in the ionisation potentials of different elements

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2021)

(e.g. N+/O+ = N/O, from Peimbert & Costero 1969). ICFs can
also be computed using photoionisation models (e.g. Kingsburgh
& Barlow 1994, hereafter KB94). More recently, Delgado-Inglada,
Morisset, & Stasi´nska (2014) (hereafter DIMS14) computed a new
set of ICFs from the large 3MdB database of models3 (Morisset,
Delgado-Inglada & Flores-Fajardo 2015).

In this work we will use the classical ICFs from KB94 as well
as those of DIMS14. But we will also, and for the ﬁrst time, use
Machine Learning techniques to determine ICFs using the 3MdB

grid of photoionisation models and to compute new ICFs speciﬁ-
cally dedicated to our object (see a also our discussion in §5.1). We
choose to look for ad-hoc ICFs for our object because PC22 is at
the limit where the DIMS14 ICFs are said by the authors not to be
valid, the nebula being too highly ionised: since the ICFs based on
O+ are not usable here, we determine ICFs for chlorine and sulfur
based on O++. We also need ICFs to be applied to (Ar3+ + Ar4+)
/ H+.

The main idea behind the determination of ICFs is to ﬁnd
photoionisation models that reproduce what is observed for a
given object, in terms of ionisation stage, to predict the ionisa-
tion of other elements. Most of the time, one ionic fraction deter-
mined from the observation is used as a proxy to determine the
ionisation stage of other elements, and in ﬁne the ICFs. Some-
times 2 fractions are used, as in the ICFs by DIMS14, based on
v =He++/(He++He++) and ω =O++/(O++O++). But only two
of their ICFs (namely N/O and Ne/O) are based on a combination
of v and ω, the other ICFs refering to only one. This is mainly
due to the difﬁculty in ﬁnding analytic functions that describe the
behaviour of one ionic fraction relative to the other one. This is ba-
sically a problem of multivariate regression, where Machine Learn-
ing based regressors excel.

In our observations of PC 22, we have 5 ionic abundances ra-
tios that can be used to determine ICFs: He++/He+, O++/O+,
Ne4+/Ne3+, Ne3+/Ne++, and Ar4+/Ar3+. The dominant ion
Ne3+ abundance is determined through the faint auroral line at
4726Å, but we still prefer to rely on this ion to compute the ICF
for Ne rather than the Ne4+/Ne++ ratio which implies two resid-
ual ions with large uncertainty. We choose to compute the ICFs
directly from the corresponding line ratios, instead of using ionic
abundance ratios. We therefore need to have some constraints on
the electron temperature that connect the line intensities to the ionic
abundances: we choose to add the [OIII] 4363/5007 line ratio to the
inputs of the Machine Learning (ML) process.

We use the python implementation of XGBoost (Chen &
Guestrin 2016) to build the ML algorithm (MLA), using a learn-
ing rate of 0.1, a number of estimators of 500, and a maximum
depth of 10 (we checked that changing these values to lower learn-
ing rates and higher number of estimators does not signiﬁcantly
changes the results, but increases the training time). Other hyper-
parameters have their default values. The XGBoost library is called
through the AI4neb facility (Morisset et al., in prep).

The input vector X is build from a 6D vector of the logarithmic

values of the following line ratios:
• He II λ 4686 / He I λ 5876
• [O III] λ 5007 / [O II] λ 3727
• [Ne V] λ λ 3426, 3346 / [Ne IV] λ 4726
• [Ne IV] λ 4726 / [Ne III] λ 3869
• [Ar V] λ 6435 / [Ar IV] λ λ 4711, 4740
• [O III] λ λ 4363/5007
We note that throughout the paper the notations [Ne V] λ λ 3426,
3346 and [Ar IV] λ λ 4711, 4740 indicate the sum of the emission
lines.
The output vector y is directly the set of the following ICFs (loga-
rithmic values are used):
• O / (O+ + O++)
• N/O × O+ / N+
• Ne / (Ne++ + Ne4+)
• Ne / (Ne++ + Ne3+ + Ne4+)
• Ne / O × O++ / Ne++
• S / (S+ + S++)
• S / O × O+ / (S+ + S++)
• S / O × O++ / (S+ + S++)
• Cl / O × O+ / Cl++
• Cl / O × O++ / Cl++
• Ar / (Ar3+ + Ar4+)

XGBoost MLA is only able to predict one output. We then
build 11 XGB MLAs, each one dedicated to the prediction of one
of the ICFs from the output.

The MLAs are trained using a subset of the 3MdB database,
corresponding to the PNe_17 models (updated version of the
database described in Morisset, Delgado-Inglada & Flores-Fajardo
(2015) and in the web site https://sites.google.com/site/
mexicanmillionmodels/, using Cloudy v17.02). We only con-
sider models close to PC 22 i.e. the models for which the predicted
values differ from the observed values by less than 0.6 dex for each
one of the 6 line ratios considered in the X vector. These ﬁlters
reduce the number of models from more than 720,000 (the whole
3MdB PNe database) to (cid:39) 16,000. We then build 11 ad-hoc re-
gressors locally around the position of PC 22 in the X space. The
training is performed on 80% of this set, the remaining 20% being
used for testing the performances of the MLAs.

The performances of the MLAs are shown in Figure 5 where
the predicted values of the 11 ICFs are compared to the real values,
for the testing set. For each ICF, the value of the standard devia-
tion of the distribution is given in dex above each plot. The color
bar (the same is used for the 11 subplots) ranges over the values
of log([O III]/[O II]) selected for the training set, ±0.6 around the
observed value of 1.6. For most of the cases, the regression is very
satisfactory, with a few percents of deviation from the real value.
The most problematic cases are the one normalized to O+, which
is a residual ion in these high excitation models.

The analysis of the feature importance of the XGBoost trained
MLAs shows that the most important line ratio is systematically
[O III]/[O II]. The second most important is He II/He I (in case of

and Ar / (Ar3+ + Ar4+) ) or [Ne V]/[Ne IV] for the other ICFs.

Once the MLAs are trained and tested, we can apply it to the
determination of the ICFs for our observation and its 5,000 MC re-
alisations. We also computed the ICFs obtained following KB94
and DIMS14. The results of the corresponding distributions are
shown in Figure 6. For some ICFs KB94 gives only one single value
that does not depend on any line ratio, in this case no distribution
is derived. For (S+ + S++)/O++, Cl++/O++, and Ar3++Ar4+, we
are producing pioneer ICFs, no comparison is possible with previ-
ous determinations.

The ICF applied to Ne++ + Ne3+ + Ne4+ (not shown here) is
very close to 1.0. The MLAs not being trained to be strictly posi-

tive, some values lower than 1.0 are predicted: they are set to 1.0
before using this ICF.

Once we have a good method to obtain ICFs dedicated to our
object, we can proceed in the determination of the total abundances
of He, N, O, Ne, Ar, Cl, and S.

3.2.6 Total abundances

We applied the ICFs determined in the previous section to the ionic
abundances to obtain the element abundances. The corresponding
distributions are shown in Figure 7. As in the case of the ICFs pre-
sented in the previous section, for each method used to obtain abun-
dances, the value corresponding to the median of the distributions
is shown with a vertical line. These values, as well as the "original"

tions, are reported in the lower part of Table 5.

The difference in using MLA, KB94 or DIMS14 for the de-
termination of the nitrogen or oxygen abundance is small (less than
0.1 dex). In the case of the sulphur abundance, our result is closer to
that obtained from the ICFs of KB94 (0.06 dex) than that from the
ICFs of DIMS14 (0.25 to 0.40 dex from MLA, depending on the
ICF used.) As explained earlier, only our estimation of the argon
abundance is present which is a unique and interesting fact.

The chlorine abundance derived with the MLA can only be
compared to that derived with DIMS14’s ICFs, and the difference
is not negligible with ≈0.13 to ≈0.28 dex.

Finally, an interesting feature is the determination of the neon
abundance where there is a difference whether Ne3+ is included
in the calculation of the ICFs or not. KB94 and DIMS14 do not
consider this line, which was likely too faint (or absent) to be taken
into account. In our case, the use of Ne3+ changes the constraint on
the neon (as the ICF is now equal to 1) and this would imply that
our estimation of Ne/H is more correct as all the neon ions are taken
into account. However, while the line is detected in PC 22, it is very
faint (∼2% of Hβ ) and very sensitive to the electron temperature.
Changing the value of Te from 13,000 to 15,000 K increases its
emissivity by a factor of 2.6, reducing the determined value of Ne/H
by almost the same factor. This could therefore cast some doubts on
the precision of the derived abundance. Also, we have to take into
account the error on the measurement of the neon abundances using
the ML with the Ne3+ included.

4 STELLAR ANALYSIS

4.1 Spectral analysis output

The spectrum of the central star of PC 22 (Fig. 8) exhibits several
WR features, including the so-called blue and red bumps (BB and
RB) at ∼4686 Å and ∼5806 Å, respectively, as well as the oxygen
or violet bump (VB) at ∼3820 Å. Other emission lines related to
WR features are also present in the optical spectrum: O VI λ 5290
and Ne VIII λ 6068.

We note that the spectrum was corrected for extinction by us-
ing the c(Hβ ) value estimated from the Balmer decrement method.
We assume an intrinsic Balmer decrement ratio corresponding to a
case B photoionised nebula of Te = 10,000 K and ne = 100 cm−3
(see Osterbrock & Ferland 2006) and the reddening curve of
Cardelli et al. (1989).

The VB and BB are composed of several blended emission
lines and need a careful ﬁtting in order to separate their broad and
narrow contributions. This was done by applying the analysis de-
scribed in detail by Gómez-González et al. (2020). The method
consists on ﬁtting the broad WR features with multi-Gaussian com-
ponents using a tailor-made code that uses the IDL routine LMFIT4.
As a result, the ﬂuxes, central wavelengths, FWHMs and equivalent
widths (EW) from the WR spectral features, as well as contributing
nebular lines, have been estimated. All these parameters are listed
in Table 6. We note that the FWHM of lines listed as WR features
is larger than that of the nebular lines.

Figure 9 shows the ﬁts for the different WR features of the

Marquardt algorithm, incorporated in the routine mrqmin from Press et al.

central star of PC 22. The VB feature is made of a broad O VI
λ 3820 (FWHM∼66 Å) of stellar origin, and several narrow lines
of nebular origin, such as H and Ne. In the BB feature the broad
He II λ 4686 WR line is blended with the C IV λ 4658. In addition,
the narrow emission lines He II and [Ar IV], present for highly ex-
cited nebulae, also contribute to the BB. There is no contribution of
nebular lines to the RB, made of the C IV λ λ 5801, 5811 doublet.

The classiﬁcation system concerning low mass [WR] stars is
based on the relative strength of the carbon (C II, C III and C IV) and
oxygen (O V, O VI, O VII and O VIII) lines (Acker & Neiner 2003).
We note that the last two features were reclassiﬁed by Werner et al.
(2007) as Ne VII and Ne VIII lines, respectively, from stellar origin.
First, an appropriate criterion to separate WO from WC appears to
be the absence of C III, as proposed by Kingsburgh (1995). A WCL-
type is excluded since the spectrum of the central star of PC 22 does
not show any C II λ 4267 and/or C III λ 5696 (see Figure 1 and Ta-
ble 3 in Crowther et al. 1998). Without this line, the WC criteria
fail. The presence of the O VI λ λ 3811, 3834 doublet is essential
for the classiﬁcation as a [WO]-subtype. The central star presents
O VI λ 3820 and O VI λ 5290 additional to the C IV λ λ 5001, 5012
doublet. This is consistent with a [WO1]-subtype. Also, quantita-
tively, for a [WR] to be classiﬁed as [WO1], log(O VI λ 3820/C IV
λ 5806) > 0.2, which applies for the spectrum of the central star as
this translates into

(i) log(EWO VI λ 3820/EWC IV λ 5806) = 1.7, ([WO1 (cid:62) 0.2; WO2 (cid:62)

0.2; WO3 = [−1 to 0.2]), which is closer to [WO1].

Based on Acker & Neiner (2003), we performed a quantitative

classiﬁcation of the central star with the following criteria:

(i) FO VI λ 3820/FRB = 7561.3, ([WO1 > 1400; WO2 = 1000±200;

WO3 = 250±40), consistent with [WO1];

(ii) FC IV λ 4658/FRB = 819.9, ([WO1 = 300 ± 100; WO2 = 270 ± 60;

WO3 = 23 ± 2), consistent with [WO1];

(iii) FC IV λ 4686/FRB = 789.7, ([WO1 = 500 ± 200; WO2 = 300 ± 30;

WO3 = 130 ± 30), consistent with [WO1];

(iv) FNe VII λ 5290/FRB = 150.0, ([WO1 > 80; WO2 = 48±2; WO3 =

20±5), consistent with [WO1];

(v) FNe VIII λ 6068/FRB = 50.3, ([WO1 = 20 ± 8; WO2 = 6±1; WO3 =

2 ± 1), consistent with [WO1].

We note that the FWHMs of the C IV λ λ 5801, 5811 dou-
blet are 4.2 and 9.2 Å, respectively, which are below expected
([WO1 = 33±5; WO2 = 32±3; WO3 = 37±6). WCL are expected
to have such small FWHMs, however, this classiﬁcation is com-
pletely ruled out for our central star as it does not present any C II
λ 4267 and/or C III λ 5696 as stated above. Furthermore, only the
early [WO]-types are expected to display strong O VI λ 3820 broad
emission lines.

Finally, the sole presence of Ne VIII λ 6068, once thought to be
O VIII, is enough to assign a temperature > 150,0000 K according
to Werner et al. (2007). We highlight that this line has only been
observed in early-type [WO] central stars.

4.2 Using 3MdB to determine Teff

We also made use of 3MdB to estimate the effective temperature of
PC 22. The main caveat is the use of a database in which the models
are built with a black body as a model atmosphere to describe the
central star, while we already established the [WR] nature of the
nucleus of PC 22. Hence, owing to the fact that there is no avail-
able UV data for the source that would have allowed us to better

constrain the nucleus characteristics, we will concentrate on repro-
ducing the ionization state of the gas seen in PC 22.

We looked for the models in 3MdB that reproduce simulta-
neously He II λ 4686 / Hβ and the consecutive ions line ratios:
[O III] λ 5007 / [O II] λ 3727, [Ar V] λ 6435 / [Ar IV] λ λ 4740, 4711,
[Ne IV] λ 4726 / [Ne III] λ 3868, and [Ne V] λ λ 3426, 3346 / [Ne IV]
λ 4726. The number of models coinciding with the ionization state
of the PN depends on the tolerance used when deﬁning the mask.
Hence, we identiﬁed 4 models ﬁtting the observations of PC 22
within a tolerance of 0.15 dex and 47 within a tolerance of 0.20
dex. In the former case the corresponding Te f f range from 230,000

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2021)

to 250,000 K, and in the latter case Te f f range from 140,000 to
250,000 K. These values, although quite high, agree with the pre-
diction by Werner et al. (2007) mentioned above.

ments, leading to a value of 4.7+2.7
−1.7 kpc (Bailer-Jones et al. 2018) from the
DR2 release. The latter has been recently superseded by the Gaia EDR3
release, resulting in a geometrical distance of 7.5+2.8
−2.3 kpc (Bailer-Jones et
al. 2021) for PC 22. However the negative parallaxes and the large uncer-
tainties of both Gaia measurements (DR2: −0.0235 ± 0.1985 mas, EDR3:
−0.1045 ± 0.1430 mas) impede the derivation of accurate distances and we
will therefore not use those based on Gaia parallax measurements.

proximately the same emission line equivalent widths, independent
of the speciﬁc combination of the particular wind parameters, as
long as T∗ and the chemical composition are the same.

Here we use a clumping contrast of D = 10, as reported by
Todt et al. (2008) for WC-type CSPNe, but we also tested larger
values without a noticeable impact on the synthetic spectrum.
Smaller values of D give a worse ﬁt.

The best ﬁt to the observation is obtained for a transformed
radius of log(Rt/R(cid:12)) = 1.27 ± 0.05. Much larger values result in
a too weak O VI λ λ 3811,3834 multiplet, while for models with
smaller value of Rt all lines become too strong.

In terms of stellar temperature, the best ﬁt to the optical spec-
trum is achieved for models with a stellar temperature of about T∗ =
130+3
−5 kK, which is the effective temperature at R∗. Our R∗ is de-
ﬁned at a radial Rosseland continuum optical depth τRoss = 20. Our
optimum T∗ corresponds to the lower limit found using 3MdB and
the highest tolerance. Temperatures below 125 kK lead to too strong
lines of O VI λ λ 3811,3834, C IV λ λ 5801,5812, O V λ 5114, and
He II λ 4686, while temperatures above 133 kK result in a too weak
O VI λ λ 3811,3834 multiplet.

We note the presence of an emission feature at about 6068 Å,
which can be reproduced with much hotter models (T∗ > 170 kK) as
a Ne VIII emission line, as reported by Werner et al. (2007). How-
ever, for such high temperatures the ﬁt to the O VI λ λ 3811,3834
multiplet becomes much worse (see Fig. 11) and also the O V lines
in the model disappear. Unfortunately, the O V lines are even in
the best ﬁtting model too weak to be unambiguously identiﬁed in
the observation, due to its low S/N. Otherwise their clear detection
would give a more reliable temperature estimate.

In the absence of stellar lines with P Cygni proﬁles, as, e.g.,
typical for the UV range, we have to estimate the terminal wind
velocity from the width of the stellar optical emission lines. In our
models the O VI λ λ 3811,3834 doublet turns out to be the most
sensitive line regarding the terminal velocity. We inferred a termi-
nal velocity of about v∞ ≈ 4500 ± 500 km s−1 with a large uncer-
tainty due to the low quality of the optical spectrum. The velocity
ﬁeld is prescribed by a so-called β -law, where we use a value of

β = 1. We also tested different values of β , but could not achieve
an improvement of the ﬁt quality.

The carbon abundance can be best determined from the
C IV λ λ 5801,5812 doublet. A good match to the observation is
obtained by models with a mass fraction of XC = 0.10 ± 0.02. As
there is no strong unblended helium line in the observation, we use
the He II λ 4684 line to estimate the helium abundance and ﬁnd a
sufﬁcient ﬁt for XHe = 0.76 ± 0.10.

As the most prominent O VI feature, the O VI λ λ 3811,3834
doublet turns out to be sensitive to several parameters. We use the
other, less sensitive O VI lines, λ λ 4500,4502, λ λ 5291,5292, and
λ 6200 (see Fig. 11) to infer an oxygen mass fraction of XO =
0.10+0.04
−0.02.
The object shows an enrichment in neon of about XNe =
0.04+0.02
−0.01 by mass, as inferred from the Ne VI λ 3902 line. Interest-
ingly, the model with the larger temperature (see above) gives for
the same neon abundance a good ﬁt to the (alleged) Ne VIII λ 6069
line, but fails to reproduce the Ne VI λ 3902 line. The reason for
such behaviour is unclear at the moment.

We can not detect any nitrogen line in the observation, hence
we give an upper limit of XN < 0.003, which is about four times the
solar value.

For hydrogen we can only give an upper limit for its abun-
dance too, as stellar Balmer lines would be blended with the corre-
sponding He II lines from the Pickering series and the strong nebu-
lar hydrogen emission lines. We ﬁnd that a hydrogen mass fraction
below 25 per cent would escape detection.

In the absence of an existing UV observation we could not

determine an iron abundance and adopted instead the solar value.

With the distance-independent parameters ﬁxed, we ﬁnally ﬁt-
ted our synthetic SED from the PoWR model to the Gaia EDR3
photometry and our observed optical spectrum, which is only rela-
tive ﬂux-calibrated. However, the absolute ﬂux level of our optical
spectrum was scaled to the Gaia Gbp magnitude. Using the redden-
ing law from Cardelli et al. (1989) with an RV = 3.1 we obtained
the luminosity distance of about 6.2 kpc and a reddening of about
E(B −V ) = 0.3 ± 0.05 mag, which is slightly higher, but still con-
sistent with the color excess inferred from c(Hβ ).

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 A new approach for the nebular analysis of PNe

In this paper we use a Monte-Carlo based method to estimate the
propagation of the uncertainties due to emission line intensity mea-
surements through the whole pipeline starting from the reddening
correction, to obtain as ﬁnal product the element abundances. The
complete distributions of the intermediate and ﬁnal parameters de-
scribing the nebula (Te, ne, ionic abundances, and total abundances)
are shown in detail, leading to an easy visualization of the asymme-
tries of the uncertainties in some cases. The resulting distributions
obtained in the previous sections depend on the initial distribution
of the uncertainties on the emission line intensities, to which we
added a systematic 10% to take into account other sources of er-
rors, for example the atomic data needed in almost any step of the
pipeline.

The ﬁnal abundance uncertainties are ranging from 0.06 dex
for O/H and 0.05 dex for Ar/H to ∼0.10 dex for N/H, Ne/H and
Cl/H and ﬁnally 0.13 dex for S/H. It is practically impossible to fol-

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2021)

low every step of the process leading to these abundances, to apply
the uncertainties propagation. The Monte Carlo method is the only
safe way to obtain this result, nowadays being easily computable
with parallel mode and multiple CPUs.

This is the ﬁrst time ICFs has been determined from a grid of
photoionisation models interpolated using an MLA. This allows a
more versatile determination of the relation between the observed
line ratio (used here instead of the ionic fraction ratios, with a proxy
for the electron temperature given by the [O III] λ λ 4363/5007 line
ratio) and the ICFs. We do not need here to ﬁrst deﬁne the form
of a function for which we will have to determine some parame-
ters using a χ 2 minimisation. This method allows also to determine
the ICFs based on 6 observed line ratios, instead of one (or two
in rare cases) ionic abundance ratios. Another advantage of using
Machine Learning is the possibility to tailor the ICFs calculations
to the object of study. These can then be compared to the more
traditional ICFs estimations by KB94 and DIMS14. In our case,
we unveil totally new ICFs for (S+ + S++)/O++, Cl++/O++, and
Ar3++Ar4+ which could not have been determined otherwise. As
a consequence the determination of the total abundances of Argon
but also neon (with some caveat, see above) in PC 22 are unique.

5.2 PC 22: a new extreme [WR]-type PN

Since Paper I, it was clear that PC 22 was a highly excited PN and in
this work the spectroscopic analysis from the nebula and the central
star conﬁrmed our previous assertion. PC 22 is not only a [WR]-
type PN but more precisely a [WO1]-subtype, placing it in a select
group of objects. Indeed, in the new edition of their CSPNe cata-
logue Weidmann, et al. (2020) listed only 5 objects with a [WO 1]-
type nucleus, namely NGC 2371-72, NGC 2452, PB 6, NGC 5189,
and Sand 3. PC 22 is therefore a new addition to this reduced group
and in the following we proceed to a comparative study with the
other [WO 1] PNe.

Similarly to NGC 2371-72 (Gómez-González et al. 2020),
NGC 5189 (Sabin et al. 2012), PB 6 (Dufour et al. 2015), and
NGC 2452 (Corradi et al. 1996), PC 22 presents a [O III]-dominated
ﬁlamentary and clumpy morphology (often characterised as "com-
plex") with internal (low ionisation) micro-structures under the
form of [N II] knots. We did not ﬁnd any mention of an extended
optical nebula around Sand 3, but at infrared wavelengths, with

18

L. Sabin et al.

WISE, a spherical or bipolar morphology (depending on λ ) has
been detected, as well as a single knot which displays an optical
counterpart (Grifﬁth et al. 2015; Gvaramadze et al. 2020). When
compared to the solar abundances derived by Lodders (2010) (see
Table 8), PC 22 is clearly N over-abundant with (N/H) ≈ 4.9(N/H)(cid:12)
and (N/O) ≈ 5.7(N/O)(cid:12). The same can be said about the Ne abun-
dance if all the ionic species are used for the calculation of the
ICFs, and in this case (Ne/H) ≈ 4.6(Ne/H)(cid:12). The difference is
less pronounced when it comes to He, Ar, S and Cl with varia-
tions of approximately 1.6, 1.5, 1.9 and 1.9 times their correspond-
ing solar values. The only sub-solar abundance is that of O with
(O/H) ≈ 0.9(O/H)(cid:12). Among the other [WO]-type PNe for which
total abundances were derived, namely NGC 2371-72 (Gómez-
González et al. 2020), PB6 (Ali & Dopita 2017) and NGC 5189
(García-Rojas et al. 2013), PC 22 shows relatively higher Ne, S
and Cl chemical abundances and could therefore be considered as
slightly more metal rich than its counterparts (see Table 8) .

In terms of effective temperatures, the different methods used
(3MdB, NLTE modelling, presence of Ne VIII λ 6068 line) point
towards a very high Teff for the CSPN of PC 22. The NLTE PoWR
analysis indicates a value of at least 130 kK. This temperature is
consistent with the other known [WO1]-type CSPNe where the
temperatures are in average on the order of ∼140 kK (see Table
9). We also emphasize the difﬁculty for the model to appropriately
ﬁt the Ne VIII λ 6068 line alongside the other bright oxygen lines
(mainly O VI λ 3811,3834).

Finally, the stellar spectral analysis suffers from the low
S/N (for this purpose) and the absence of UV data. Therefore,
our reported values for parameters such as the terminal veloc-
ity of the stellar wind (v∞ ≈ 4500 km s−1) and the mass-loss rate
( ˙M/M(cid:12) yr−1 ∼ 4.2 × 10−8) have to be taken carefully, the latter in
particular because of the unknown distance towards PC 22.

6 SUMMARY

Following the morpho-kinematics investigation of the planetary
nebula PC 22 (Paper I), we now present a nebular and stellar anal-
ysis. The main ﬁndings are described in the following:

• We described in detail the use of a Monte Carlo (MC) analy-
sis combined with PyNeb to allow a sensible analysis of the pho-
toionised nebular environment of the PN. The MC method takes
into account typical uncertainties of the line intensities in the whole
process, leading to abundances determination (including redden-
ing correction, electron temperature and density, and ionic abun-
dances). Ultimately, we ﬁnd that the values of the elemental abun-
dances are determined with ± 12% to ± 30% of uncertainties (0.05
to 0.13 dex).
• We also made use of a Machine Learning technique to determine
the ICFs speciﬁc to PC 22 by employing the python implementation
of XGBoost in combination with the 3MdB database. Our ICFs
were also compared to those from Delgado-Inglada, Morisset, &
Stasi´nska (2014) and Kingsburgh & Barlow (1994); and in the case
of (S+ + S++)/O++, Cl++/O++, and Ar3++Ar4+ we report ﬁrst
time ICF estimations.
• The nebular analysis is based on the data from the internal re-
gion of the nebula and we obtained electronic temperatures Te ≈
10,800 K using [N II] and ≈ 13,000 K using [O III]. The electronic
density ne is ≈ 700 cm−3. We used our ICFs to determined the
total abundances and we draw a particular attention to the neon
abundance where we obtained an ICF=1 after including Ne3+ in

the calculations and therefore producing variations from the esti-
mations by DIMS14 and KB94. PC 22 is found to be nitrogen and
neon over-abundant but in the same range as its [WO]-type counter-
parts (see below) and also shows an oxygen deﬁciency (sub-solar
abundances).
• The stellar analysis indicated a [WO1]-type classiﬁcation for
PC 22 based on the presence of the so-called violet (or oxygen)-
(3820Å), blue- (4686Å) and red- (5806Å) bumps as well as the
O VI λ 5291,5292 and Ne VIII λ 6068 lines. The presence of the
latter allowed us to constrain the stellar temperature (hence as-
sumed to be (cid:62) 150 kK). The 3MdB was also used to reproduce
the ionization state of the gas, implying effective temperatures be-
tween 140 kK and 250 kK (depending on the adopted tolerance).
Finally, and in addition, the PoWR NLTE model atmosphere code
was also applied to our observations and the best ﬁt model indi-
cated a stellar temperature of 130+3
−5 kK, which might be higher
as the Ne VIII λ 6068 could not be properly ﬁt. Overall, the CSPN
of PC 22 shows a high Teff consistent with [WR]-type CSPNe as
well as other [WO1]-type in particular. The NLTE modelling also
allowed us to derived values for the high stellar wind velocity and
the mass loss but these have to be taken with caution due to the
low S/N of the stellar spectrum and the unknown distance. Finally
the best ﬁt for the surface abundances (by mass fraction) of PC 22
indicated values of H<0.25, He=0.76, C=0.10, N<0.003, O=0.10,
Ne=0.04 and Fe=0.0014.

PC 22 is therefore a new addition to the small group of [WO1]-
type PNe, although the lack of UV spectroscopic data hampers a
more complete analysis (mostly of the CSPN) as it was the case
for NGC 2371-72 Gómez-González et al. (2020) and NGC 6905
Gómez-González et al. (2022). However, besides the presentation
of new sophisticated analysis techniques, the data presented here
will without a doubt contribute to the better understanding of ob-
jects with [WR]-type CSPNe.
