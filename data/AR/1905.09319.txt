ABSTRACT

We examine the diﬀerent element abundances exhibited by the closed loop solar corona and the slow
speed solar wind. Both are subject to the First Ionization Potential (FIP) Eﬀect, the enhancement
in coronal abundance of elements with FIP below 10 eV (e.g. Mg, Si, Fe) with respect to high FIP
elements (e.g. O, Ne, Ar), but with subtle diﬀerences. Intermediate elements, S, P, and C, with FIP
just above 10 eV, behave as high FIP elements in closed loops, but are fractionated more like low
FIP elements in the solar wind. On the basis of FIP fractionation by the ponderomotive force in the
chromosphere, we discuss fractionation scenarios where this diﬀerence might originate. Fractionation
low in the chromosphere where hydrogen is neutral enhances the S, P and C abundances. This arises
with nonresonant waves, which are ubiquitous in open ﬁeld regions, and is also stronger with torsional
Alfv´en waves, as opposed to shear (i.e. planar) waves. We discuss the bearing these ﬁndings have
on models of interchange reconnection as the source of the slow speed solar wind. The outﬂowing
solar wind must ultimately be a mixture of the plasma in the originally open and closed ﬁelds, and
the proportions and degree of mixing should depend on details of the reconnection process. We also
describe novel diagnostics in ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy now available with these
new insights, with the prospect of investigating slow speed solar wind origins and the contribution of
interchange reconnection by remote sensing.

1. INTRODUCTION

The prediction of the existence of the solar wind
(Parker 1958) must rank as one of the key theoretical
insights in the history of heliophysics. Since its discov-
ery (Gringauz et al. 1960; Neugebauer & Snyder 1962),
Parker’s original concept of a wind driven by thermal
pressure in a corona heated by magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) waves (Parker 1963) has been slightly modiﬁed
to a scenario where the MHD waves drive the wind

directly (e.g. Belcher 1971; Isenberg & Hollweg 1982;
Ofman 2010). The fast solar wind is established to
emerge from coronal holes, open ﬁeld regions where
plasma emerges directly from the solar chromosphere
into the wind, and exhibits largely unbalanced Alfv´enic
turbulence (Bruno & Carbone 2013; Ko et al. 2018). By
contrast the slow solar wind, which shows strong chemi-
cal fractionation eﬀects in its composition and more bal-
anced (or high cross-helicity) turbulence, is frequently
believed to originate in closed coronal loops where the
fractionation occurs (e.g. Antiochos et al. 2011), before
being released into the solar wind by interchange recon-
nection with surrounding open ﬁeld, as well as possibly

coming directly from open ﬁeld like the fast solar wind
(Cranmer et al. 2007).

Solar wind acceleration and composition depend on
processes at three transition layers in the solar upper at-
mosphere. The ﬁrst, usually located in the low chromo-
sphere, is where the pressure changes from being ther-
mally dominated to being magnetically dominated. In
this region the sound speed and Alfv´en speed are equal,
and a number of processes involving wave mode conver-
sion and other wave-wave interactions can occur. This
is where a signiﬁcant fraction of the MHD waves that
eventually accelerate the solar wind are generated from
motions ultimately deriving from solar convection. The
second transition layer appears higher up in the chromo-
sphere, where largely neutral gas gives way to the ion-
ized plasma that ends up as the solar corona and wind.
This transition gives rise to strong density gradients and
associated wave reﬂection and refraction. Alfv´en waves
interacting with this density gradient generate the pon-
deromotive force. This combines the eﬀect of the wave
pressure gradient and the force on the plasma wave due
to wave reﬂection and refraction. Since the waves are
fundamentally magnetic in character, only ions see this
force, and ion-neutral separation is the result, giving rise
to element fractionation in the upper atmosphere known
as the First Ionization Potential (FIP) Eﬀect. This
abundance anomaly has been seen in the solar corona
and wind for over ﬁfty years (e.g. Pottasch 1963), and
can be seen to oﬀer a key observable for wave processes
that until now has remained largely unexploited.

The third transition layer, and arguably the hardest to
understand in a quantitative theoretical manner, is the
evolution of the solar plasma from a ﬂuid to a collision-
less plasma dominated by kinetic eﬀects. This happens
where the ion-proton collision rate becomes slower than
the solar wind expansion rate, vw (r) /r, where vw (r)
is the solar wind speed and r is the heliocentric radius.

acceleration of the solar wind. Ions can only be acceler-
ated by the absorption of ion cyclotron waves once they
are decoupled from ﬂuid motions (Cranmer et al. 1999;
Miralles et al. 2001). Diﬀerent ions will accelerate at
diﬀerent rates depending on where exactly they decou-
ple and on how much MHD wave energy is available to
them at their ion cyclotron resonant frequency.

The behavior of waves and how they interact with
these three transition layers is crucial to the accelera-
tion and elemental composition of the solar wind. The
varieties of fractionation that are routinely exhibited by
the solar corona and wind are shown in Figure 1, re-
plotted from data given in Table 1 of Reames (2018).
The top panel shows element fractionations for Solar
Energetic Particles (SEPs) relative to the O abundance
of Caﬀau et al. (2011), given as black circles with error
bars, together with model calculation designed to match
abundances determined remotely by spectroscopy of a
closed coronal loop, with an assumed coronal magnetic
ﬁeld of 30G for shear (magenta dashed curve) and tor-
sional (green dashed curve) Alfv´en waves. The calcula-
tion is described in detail below, but for now we point
out that both in observations and the model, S, P and
C behave mainly as high FIP elements, being fraction-
ated by an insigniﬁcant amount. Reames (2018) points
out that this correspondence in element abundances be-
tween SEPs and closed coronal loops means that the
particles that end up being accelerated in shock waves
must have an origin in the closed loop solar corona, and
cannot be swept up out of the ambient solar wind, as
previously argued elsewhere. Laming et al. (2013, and
references therein) reach the same conclusion on some-
what diﬀerent grounds.

The middle panel shows similar measurements for ac-
celerated particles measured in Corotating Interaction
Regions (CIRs, black symbols) and slow solar wind
(dark gray symbols). In contrast with the case above,
in CIRs, the accelerated particles are swept up directly
from the solar wind, hence the correspondence between
the sets of observations. The models show fractionations
in open ﬁeld with a magnetic ﬁeld of 30G at the top of
the chromosphere for shear and torsional Alfv´en waves
as before. A key diﬀerence, picked up by both model
curves but especially by the torsional Alfv´en waves, is
that S, P and C now behave more like low FIP ele-
ments. This diﬀerence in behavior between SEPs and
solar wind had been visible previously in SEPs (Ko et al.
2013) and solar ﬂares (Sylwester et al. 2008, 2012), com-
pared with solar wind observations (Giammanco et al.

(2012). As we argue further below, this diﬀerence in
fractionation pattern is crucial to understanding slow
solar wind origin, and the processes such as interchange
reconnection that form it.

Finally, for completeness, in the bottom panel we show
results for the fast solar wind, together with models
(again for shear and torsional waves) for open ﬁeld re-
gions with coronal ﬁelds of and 10 G. With the excep-
tion of S which has large error bars,(but is measured
lower by Gloeckler & Geiss 2007), shear Alfv´en waves
(the magenta curve) are clearly favored by the model
(more details given in section 2), while torsional waves
better reproduce the slow solar wind abundances, espe-
cially S, P, and C.

Although interchange reconnection was originally in-
troduced as a means of releasing FIP fractionated ma-
terial in closed loops into the solar wind, we are ﬁnding
that it is also important as a source of torsional Alfv´en
waves, which we discuss further below. Thus plasma
fractionation on open ﬁeld lines may be qualitatively
diﬀerent in coronal holes away from closed ﬁelds or in
active regions close to closed ﬁeld regions.

The diﬀerences between these panels suggest that pos-
sibilities exist for diagnosing the origin of the solar wind
in terms of the magnetic geometry of the structure(s)
from which it emanates in terms of the microphysics as
embodied by the element abundances. In section 2 of
this paper, we give a more detailed discussion of the ori-
gins of the FIP fractionation and how the variations in
fractionation may be related to wave properties in diﬀer-
ent magnetic structures. Section 3 gives model results,
while section 4 summarizes other possible mechanisms
of fractionation. Section 5 outlines an observational ap-
proach to validate some of these hypotheses, and section
6 concludes.

2. FIP FRACTIONATION

Laming et al.

2.1. Open Versus Closed Field

We describe in more detail the calculations producing
the model results in Fig. 1. We begin with the two
simple scenarios shown schematically in Fig. 2, an open
ﬁeld region and a closed coronal loop, which serve as
the basic models for fast solar wind and coronal or SEP
abundances respectively. In open ﬁeld regions, waves de-
riving from convection within the solar envelope prop-
agate upwards to the footpoint, and either enter the
coronal hole or are reﬂected back down again. These
waves entering the coronal hole ultimately drive the so-
lar wind outﬂow. Typically the periods of these waves
(three or ﬁve minutes) are too long for resonance with
a closed coronal loop, and so in this case they are gen-
erally reﬂected back downwards when encountering the
footpoints of such loops. Resonant waves are most plau-
sibly excited within the coronal loop itself, most likely as
a byproduct of the mechanism(s) that heat the corona
(Dahlburg et al. 2016; Tarr 2017). In open ﬁeld regions,
such a resonance does not exist, and only waves propa-
gating up from footpoints are possible. Cranmer et al.
(2007) was able to show that the MHD turbulence in an
open slow-solar-wind ﬂux tube could have some low-FIP
abundance enhancement (i.e., the Fe/O ratio) without
the need for closed loops to undergo interchange recon-
nection. Hence the slow solar wind composition is most
likely a combination of the compositions arising from
the two scenarios, as a closed loop interchange recon-
nects (e.g. Lynch et al. 2014; Higginson & Lynch 2017)
with neighboring open ﬁeld to release its plasma into
the solar wind. This has been recently discussed in
terms of the evolution of the Separatrix-Web (S-Web;
Antiochos et al. 2011), the network of quasi-separatrix
layers formed by open ﬁeld corridors within otherwise
closed ﬁeld regions.

Interchange reconnection is also important in ex-
citing torsional Alfv´en waves.
Lynch et al. (2014);
Higginson & Lynch (2017) report simulations showing
a large scale torsional Alfv´en wave arising as open ﬁeld
reconnects with a twisted closed loop, with the twist
being transferred to the resulting open ﬁeld. The twist
excites torsional waves as it relaxes. In the models pre-
sented above ponderomotive force from torsional waves
seems to be important in fractionating S/O to the levels
seen in the slow speed solar wind, and the torsional
wave amplitudes seen in the simulation of Lynch et al.
(2014) and in the observations of Tiwari et al. (2018)
are consistent with our models.
It is possible that
this wave is not involved in the solar wind accelera-
tion. Vasheghani Farahani et al. (2012) argue that these
waves do not couple to other modes or to each other as
well as shear Alfv´en waves, meaning that any turbulent

cascade will be less eﬃcient in producing waves in the
ion-cyclotron range that can resonant with solar wind
ions. But conversely they might better survive prop-
agation through the chromosphere to fractionate the
plasma. In this way the fast wind is also diﬀerent; the
(shear) waves that fractionate the plasma are also taken
to be the waves that reﬂect, cascade and ultimately
accelerate the solar wind.

2.2. Ponderomotive Ion-Neutral Separation

Laming (2004) introduced the idea that ion-neutral
separation in the chromosphere arises as a result of the
ponderomotive force. This force arises as a result of
Alfv´en or fast mode (collectively known as “Alfv´enic”
when close to parallel propagation) waves propagating
through or reﬂecting from the solar chromosphere. In
the absence of wave reﬂection or refraction (the WKB
approximation), the ponderomotive force is just the neg-
ative wave pressure gradient. However, in the presence
of wave reﬂection or refraction, the wave particle inter-
action is mediated through the refractive index of the
plasma, with the result that MHD waves and ions are
attracted to each other (the opposite of the negative
wave pressure gradient). A general form for the instan-
taneous ponderomotive acceleration, a, experienced by
an ion is (see e.g. the appendix of Laming 2017)

a =

where δE is the wave electric ﬁeld, B the ambient mag-
netic ﬁeld, c the speed of light, and z is a coordinate
along the magnetic ﬁeld.

The element fractionation by the ponderomotive force
is calculated from momentum equations for ions and
neutrals in a background of protons and neutral hydro-
gen. The ratios, fk, of densities ρk for element k at
upper and lower boundaries of the fractionation region
zu and zl respectively, is given by the equation (Laming
2017)

ward and downward propagating sound waves. Because

νki >> νkn in the fractionation region at the top of the
chromosphere, small departures of ξk from unity can re-
sult in large decreases in the fractionation. This feature
is important in suppressing the fractionation of S, P, and
C at the top of the chromosphere, while allowing it lower
down where the H is neutral, giving rise to the diﬀerent
fractionation of these elements in the various panels of
Fig. 1.

The speciﬁcation of v||,osc is outlined in the next sub-
section. Here we describe the implementation of some
important approximations near the plasma β = 1 layer.
When v||,osc is greater than the local Alfv´en speed,
all fractionation is assumed to cease. We argue that
the sound waves will excite counter-propagating Alfv´en
waves which can then cascade to microscopic scales mix-
ing the plasma at a rate much faster than it can be
fractionated. In general, v||,osc has contributions from
upward propagating sound waves excited by solar con-
vection, and sound wave excited in the chromosphere
by the Alfv´en wave driver (e.g. Arber et al. 2016) by
the modulational instability (sometimes known as para-
metric excitation e.g. Landau & Lifshitz 1976). Similar
arguments restrict the fractionation to the plasma β < 1
region of the solar atmosphere. Here sound waves can
also decay directly to counter-propagating Alfv´en waves
which can again cause mixing after cascading to micro-
scopic scales.

2.3. Chromospheric Model and Wave Fields

We take the chromospheric model of Avrett & Loeser
(2008) for temperature, density and electron density
proﬁles, combined with a force free magnetic ﬁeld cal-
culated from formulae given by Athay (1981). This
captures the behavior low in the chromosphere as the
magnetic ﬁeld decreases with height near the plasma
β = 1 layer, and is constant with height above this re-
gion. The temperature and density proﬁles are shown
in the top left panel of Fig. 3. The hydrogen ionization
balance dominating the electron density is shown as the
thick line on the top right panel of Fig. 3. The de-
gree of ionization inferred observationally is higher than
equilibrium at the local density and temperature would
suggest, presumably due to the passage of shock waves
that elevate the ionization fraction on timescales faster
than that associated with electron-proton recombination
(Carlsson & Stein 2002). Ionization balances for other
elements are calculated here using the local tempera-
ture, density, and radiation ﬁeld. This comprises coro-
nal radiation from above, taken from Vernazza & Reeves
(1978), absorbed progressively in the chromosphere, and
trapped chromospheric Lyman α photons. The coronal
spectrum varies from coronal holes to active regions,

introducing small variations in the ionization fraction
of minor ions, most visible in the high FIP elements.
Atomic data are taken from Verner et al. (1996) for
photoionization cross sections, and from Mazzotta et al.
(1998) for collisional rates. We are only concerned with
neutral atoms and singly charged ions so subsequent
reﬁnements to dielectronic recombination rates as con-
sidered in Bryans et al. (2009) are largely unimportant.
We do however include the eﬀects of electron density on
the dielectronic recombination, following Nikoli´c et al.
(2013). Uncertainties in the ionization balance are prob-
ably dominated by the underlying chromospheric model
and the assumed coronal ionizing spectrum rather than
by atomic data deﬁciencies.

Chromospheric acoustic waves are introduced to
match simulations and data analysis in Heggland et al.
(2011) and Carlsson et al. (2015). Acoustic waves with
a ﬂux of 108 ergs cm−2s−1 propagate upwards through
the chromosphere with their amplitude increasing as the
density decreases in accordance with the WKB approx-
imation, until the amplitude reaches the local sound
speed. At this point we stop the amplitude growth,
arguing that the excess energy is lost to the wave by
radiation and conduction, principally cooling by Lyman
α with a timescale of the order of seconds. Lower down
the cooling is dominated by H− with a timescale of
order minutes (Ayres & Rabin 1996).

The Alfv´en waves are modeled using transport equa-
tions given by Cranmer & van Ballegooijen (2005) and
Laming (2015),

The Alfv´en wave spectrum in the coronal hole model
is taken from from Cranmer et al. (2007). We spec-
ify ﬁve waves to match the peaks in the theoretical
spectrum, and start the integration at an altitude
of 500,000 km, where the outgoing waves dominate
(Cranmer & van Ballegooijen 2005). At an altitude of
1,000 km in the coronal hole, where the sound speed
and Alfv´en speeds are equal, the Alfv´en wave solution
107 ergs cm−2s−1,
corresponds to an energy ﬂux of
comparable to but slightly less than the upward acoustic
wave energy ﬂux that generates these waves.

In the closed ﬁeld model, we assume coronal waves
only, which are taken to be the loop resonant mode as
in Laming (2012, 2017) and Rakowski & Laming (2012).

observed FIP fractionations, and is typically

this amplitude are indeed produced as a “by-product”
of the heating mechanism (Dahlburg et al. 2016; Tarr
2017).

At high Alfv´en wave energy ﬂuxes, the ponderomotive
force will modify the structure of the chromosphere it-
self. We estimate when this will occur as follows. The
expression for the ponderomotive acceleration can be
modiﬁed to (Laming 2015)

ﬂow speed in the chromospheric model. Since the pon-
deromotive force separates ions from neutrals, its eﬀect
on the background plasma to smooth out density gradi-
ents depends on the coupling between ionized and neu-
tral hydrogen, and is strongest in regions where hydro-
gen is fully ionized (ξ = 1), and becomes signiﬁcant at
ponderomotive accelerations above about 106 cm s−2,
possibly giving rise to a mechanism of saturation.

ionization balances for low and high FIP elements. The
bottom three panels show the energy ﬂuxes (left and
right going) for the ﬁve shear Alfv´en waves compris-
ing the model spectrum, the ponderomotive acceleration
and amplitude of sound waves generated by the Alfv´en
wave driver, and the resulting fractionations. At alti-
tudes below about 1,400 km, the amplitude of sound
waves is higher than the local Alfv´en speed and no frac-
tionation occurs. Above this height, fractionation of Fe,
Mg, and Si sets in with magnitude 1.5 - 2.0, S and C are
much less enhanced, by 1.1 - 1.2, and Ar, Ne and He are
depleted. This depletion of He is characteristic of frac-
tionation concentrated at the top of the chromosphere.

3.2. Closed Coronal Loop

Figure 4 shows similar panels to Fig. 3, but now for
a closed coronal loop with a magnetic ﬁeld at the top of

the chromosphere of 30G. The β = 1 layer is now at 750
km altitude. However fractionation still is only signiﬁ-
cant at heights similar to that in the coronal hole. Here
the reason is that the model contains only one coronal
shear Alfv´en wave that is trapped in the coronal loop,
and insuﬃcient wave energy leaks low enough in the
chromosphere to cause fractionation lower down. The
pattern of fractionation is similar, but larger than, that
in the coronal hole. Fe, Mg, and Si are enhanced by fac-
tors of 3 - 4.5, S and C by 1.1 - 1.6, and He and Ar are
again depleted. Similarly to the coronal hole, the pon-
106 cm s−2,
deromotive acceleration shows a spike of
about twice as large as in the coronal hole, at an altitude
of 2,150 km where the chromospheric density gradient is
strongest, and this is where the strongest fractionation
occurs.

3.3. Slow Speed Solar Wind

Both examples above show S and C behaving more
like high FIP elements, in that they do not fractionate
appreciably. Figure 5 shows examples of fractionation
in open ﬁeld with magnetic ﬁeld similar to the closed
loop (30 G at the top of the chromosphere) that show a
transition from S and C behaving as high FIP elements
as above, to becoming fractionated like the low FIP el-
ements. The top row, (a), (b), and (c) show the (shear)
Alfv´en wave energy ﬂuxes, and ponderomotive accelera-
tion and associated slow mode amplitude, and the FIP
fractionations respectively. This example has relatively
high Alfv´en wave amplitudes, leading to a spike in the
ponderomotive acceleration of about 106 cm s−2 as in
the closed loop case, and similar fractionation to that
case. The slow mode wave amplitude developing in the
lower chromosphere is larger than the local Alfv´en speed,
suppressing any fractionation there.

The middle row (d), (e), and (f), show similar plots,
but for an open ﬁeld with lower energy ﬂuxes for the
shear Alfv´en waves. The signiﬁcance of the spike in the
ponderomotive acceleration is reduced, but slow modes
lower down are of lower amplitude, allowing fraction-
ation to occur there. The shift of FIP fractionation to
lower altitudes where H is largely neutral allows S and C
to behave more like low FIP elements. In equation 3 we
no longer have νki >> νkn, and so a small departure of
ξk from unity no longer suppresses the fractionation in
the same way as it does in a background gas of protons.
Hence elements like S, P, and C can become fraction-
ated low in the chromosphere, whereas higher up they
cannot. This behavior is even more pronounced in the
bottom row, panels (g), (h), and (i), which show a sim-
ilar model except that shear Alfv´en waves have been
replaced by torsional waves, which generate even lower
slow mode wave amplitudes (Vasheghani Farahani et al.
2011; Laming 2017). Even more fractionation occurs
close to the β = 1 layer, with correspondingly more S
and C. Such waves, when combined with mass depen-
dent fractionation discussed in section 3 give the green
dashed curve in the middle panel of Fig. 1. Note the
enhanced S, P, and C compared to the magenta curve
representing shear Alfv´en waves. Such eﬀects are much
less prominent in the closed loop model. Here shear
and torsional Alfv´en waves produce essentially the same
fractionation pattern (Laming 2017), because the Alfv´en
waves remain trapped in the loop and do not penetrate
to the lower chromospheric regions where H is neutral,
and where the amplitude of sound waves coming up from
the photosphere is much lower.

When FIP fractionation is concentrated low in the
chromosphere, He remains undepleted, and S, P, and C

are fractionated. The reverse is true when FIP fraction-
ation is concentrated at the top of the chromosphere;
He and Ne are depleted, and S, P, and C are essentially
unchanged.
In this way the pattern of FIP fractiona-
tion can be seen to be dependent on wave properties
in the solar atmosphere, and to oﬀer an novel and un-
expected window into this physics. In particular, per-
turbations akin to torsional Alfv´en waves are expected
as part of the slow solar wind release process through
interchange reconnection. Open ﬁeld reconnecting with
twisted closed ﬁeld takes on the twist (e.g. Lynch et al.
2014; Higginson & Lynch 2017) which propagates away.
This process should easily excite both upward and down-
ward propagating torsional waves as the it proceeds.
Even so, this observed behavior may suppress the ex-
citation of sound waves compared to shear waves even
more than that modeled in Vasheghani Farahani et al.
(2011) and Laming (2017), reinforcing our conclusion.

4. MASS AND CHARGE DEPENDENT
FRACTIONATION AND ACCELERATION

4.1. Introduction

While FIP fractionation by the ponderomotive force
is the dominant mechanism of abundance modiﬁcation,
a number of other possibilities exist in the solar wind.
Analysis of solar wind samples returned by the Genesis
mission has revealed isotopic fractionation between fast
and slow solar wind (Heber et al. 2012a), where lighter
isotopes are more abundant relative to heavy ones of the
same element in the slow wind compared to the fast.
This is the reverse of what equation 3 would predict for
the ponderomotive force, so clearly other mechanism(s)
must be at work.

4.2. Ineﬃcient Coulomb Drag

Ineﬃcient Coulomb Drag (ICD) is usually imple-
mented following Geiss et al. (1970). Assuming that
H ﬂows fastest in the solar wind, the ﬂow velocity of
other elements vk is calculated relative to that of H, VH ,
as

An important point is that abundance modiﬁcations are
only sustainable in the solar wind while there is a colli-
sional connection back to the solar disk. Once the ﬂow
becomes collisionless according to equation 1, no further
fractionation is possible. All elements passing through
this region must eventually ﬂow out in the solar wind.

with the implication that in the solar wind ICD
only fractionates particles according to the variation
of r/vw (r) where they freeze in,
since the factor

writing, this is a diﬃcult eﬀect to quantify, but we spec-
ulate that it results in possibly a much smaller fraction-
ation than quoted previously (e.g. Bodmer & Bochsler
1998; Bochsler 2007). The parameter controlling this
most closely will be the plasma density, which has the
strongest variation with r.

−

At 1 A.U. though, minor ions (including He) are gen-
erally observed to ﬂow faster than H (e.g. Kohl et al.
2006; Berger et al. 2011), limiting the applicability of
equation 6. This preferential acceleration presumably
sets in once the wind has become collisionless, where
equation 6 is no longer valid in any case.

4.3. Gravitational Settling

Gravitational settling in a closed coronal loop prior to
eruption can be modeled with the same equation. The
whole loop can be assumed to be collisionally coupled to
the solar disk, so the complication from the transition to
collisionless plasma does not arise. From the continuity
equation

While He depletion can be caused by the ponderomotive
force as part of the FIP fractionation, Ne should be-
have similarly. And the He depletions observed, He/H
as low as 1% (Kasper et al. 2012; Kepko et al. 2016),
appear to be too extreme to be reproduced by the pon-
deromotive force, so gravitational settling where He set-
tles relative to O and O settles relative to Ne appears
to be the most plausible explanation. Finally, heavy
ion dropouts are also observed on occasion in the solar
wind (Weberg et al. 2012, 2015), clearly indicating grav-
itational settling prior to plasma release into the solar
wind as in Feldman et al. (1998) where Fe (settling time
according the above of 2.4 days) is seen depleted relative
to Si (4.3 days).

4.4. First Adiabatic Invariant Conservation

In Laming et al. (2017),

it was argued that the
dominant mass-dependent fractionation eﬀect should
be that of the conservation of the ﬁrst adiabatic in-
variant,
in conditions where the ion gyrofrequency
Ω = eB/mkc >> νip. When an ion undergoes many
gyro-orbits around the magnetic ﬁeld line in the time
between Coulomb collisions with other ions (mainly
protons), the magnetic ﬂux enclosed by its orbit is con-
v2
served. Hence Br2
⊥/B is constant (rg is the particle
gyroradius), giving rise to an acceleration

when v2 = v2
⊥ is constant. While the plasma is still
collisionally connected to the solar envelope (i.e. before
it becomes collisionless and undergoes acceleration into
the solar wind) a mass dependent fractionation results

where L is the loop length, and vk is the element settling
velocity (absolute magnitude) calculated from equation
6 with VH = 0. This has solutions of the form

106 K and L = 75, 000
Assuming n
km, the gravitational settling (1/ exp) times evaluate
to 1.5, 3.6, and 5.0 days for He, O, and Ne respectively.
Thus such abundance modiﬁcations are only likely to oc-
cur in the most quiescent of solar coronal structures (see
e.g. Raymond et al. 1997). Landi & Testa (2015) ob-
serve variations in the Ne/O abundance ratio consistent
with this, in quiescent coronal streamers and in the slow-
est speed solar wind at solar minimum of 2005 - 2008,
with Ne/O increasing to 0.25 during this period, higher
than its more usual value of 0.17. Kasper et al. (2012)
and Rakowski & Laming (2012) observe the He/H and
He/O abundance ratios moving in the opposite direction.

This arises because the thermal speeds v2
⊥ and 2kBT /mk
are proportional to 1/mk, while v2
k represent-
ing ﬂuid motions are not, and are usually much larger,
and can match the isotopic diﬀerences between high
speed and low speed solar wind.

4.5. Resonant Heating by Ion Cyclotron Waves

Since the advent of the SOlar and Heliospheric Obser-
vatory (SOHO Domingo et al. 1995) and ensuing imag-
ing missions, the solar atmosphere has come to be in-
creasingly appreciated as a dynamic and complex en-
vironment. Waves play a much larger role in shaping
the plasma properties than hitherto assumed and they
can have comparable energy densities to the thermal
gas in the corona. For example, a major discovery made

by the Ultraviolet Coronagraph-Spectrometer on SOHO
(UVCS Kohl et al. 1995, 1997, 2006) was that of sig-
niﬁcant heating in the O5+ ion inferred from spectral
line broadening, beginning at altitudes where the plasma
becomes collisionless according to equation 1, and to a
lesser extent also in Mg9+. It is likely that all heavy ions
are heated in this manner and location— O VI and Mg X
were the only ions accessible to UVCS observation with
suﬃcient counting statistics. This heating is believed
to derive from resonance with ion-cyclotron waves. Ma-
jor questions surround the origin of the ion cyclotron
waves, with in situ generation, presumably via a tur-
bulent cascade from lower frequency Alfv´en waves, be-
ing favored (Cranmer 2001; Hollweg & Isenberg 2002),
and the degree of isotropy in the heating, with strongly
anisotropic energization with perpendicular tempera-
ture, T⊥ >> T||, the parallel temperature, favored. This
T⊥ is converted to parallel velocity in the expanding
magnetic ﬁeld lines by conservation of the ﬁrst adiabatic
invariant, leading to solar wind acceleration.

Further insight into these processes can only come
from observing ion cyclotron resonant heating in a wider

variety of ions, establishing the spectrum of ion cy-
clotron waves and the rates of acceleration of various
ions into the solar wind. For example, ion energization
can arise as ion cyclotron waves progressively cascade
to higher frequencies, or are brought into resonance by
frequency sweeping might be expected to lose all their
energy to the lowest gyrofrequency ion in the plasma
(e.g. Vocks & Marsch 2002), until the velocity distribu-
tion function of that ion becomes suﬃciently distorted to
reach marginal stability allowing wave to pass through
that resonance to the next lowest gyrofrequency ion.
Such a case would have a quite diﬀerent distribution of
ion non-thermal line broadenings to a case where ion cy-
clotron waves were excited directly by e.g. reconnection
(Liu et al. 2011).

5. OBSERVING STRATEGIES TO TEST THE
ROLES OF ELEMENT FRACTIONATION AND
MHD WAVES

5.1. General Observing Concept

Oﬀ-limb observations give the best view of the so-
lar corona uncontaminated by emission from plasma at
lower altitudes. The choice of waveband is a trade-
oﬀ between count rates and the selection of diagnostic
lines available, with the best compromise generally be-
ing found in the Far Ultraviolet (FUV) and close by part
of the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) wavebands. Higher
throughput may be achieved at longer wavelengths, es-
pecially from the ground (e.g. the Daniel K. Inouye So-
lar Telescope; Tritschler et al. 2015), but with reduced
availability of useful diagnostic lines for our speciﬁc
purposes. Pushing further into the EUV would give
more useful lines, but with diminished count rates due
to mirror and grating reﬂectivities. Additionally, the
FUV/EUV combination includes the H Lyman series
and also lines with radiative and collisionally excited
components, adding to the diagnostic utility.

Such oﬀ-limb UV spectroscopy would directly observe
the element abundance fractionations (e.g. those illus-
trated in Table 1) in various coronal structures, allow-
ing these to be traced back to the solar disk and re-
lated to the properties of MHD waves propagating in
the solar atmosphere, with particular references to how
these waves interact and drive the solar wind through
ion cyclotron resonance. This approach drives the spa-
tial and temporal resolution of observations, discussed
further below. Figure 6 shows a schematic diagram of
the observation concept. Slits observing oﬀ limb at pro-
jected heliocentric distances between 1.3 and 3.0 R⊙ re-
turn Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) and Far UltraViolet
(FUV) spectra. The slit heights are chosen to represent
the solar corona ﬂuid-kinetic transition region discussed

12

Laming et al.

above, where the acceleration of the solar wind com-
mences, and a region where solar wind acceleration and
the associated line broadening should be readily visible.
Ideally, several slit conﬁgurations would be available e.g.
a single slit for detailed spectroscopy of the widest pos-
sible selection of lines, and two slits for observing only
the strongest lines for wave and shock studies, allow-
ing the discrimination between upward and downward
propagating, and standing waves.

In an alternative approach, the Spectral Investigation
of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) instrument on So-
lar Orbiter (Fludra et al. 2013) views the solar disk di-
rectly, in order to study the solar source of the wind
simultaneously detected in situ on the same spacecraft.
It will view a subset of the lines in our envisaged EUV
bandpass, and use one slit (of varying sizes) at a time.
These observations will be more focussed on identify-
ing the precise sources of the solar wind through their
abundance patterns, and less on the wave physics and
acceleration processes in the extended corona. They
will, however, have strong S lines within their bandpass,
allowing the study of some of the subtle fractionation
issues discussed above.

In the following subsections, we consider the spectral
bandpasses in the FUV and EUV which optimize the
coverage of spectral lines from diﬀerent low and high
FIP elements for FIP fractionation studies (5.2), and
the special considerations required for lines which are
also excited radiatively by absorption of light from the
solar disk (5.3). Following those we discuss the observ-
ing approach for abundance studies, speciﬁcally He and
S (5.4), direct wave observations with two slits (5.5),
and the application of our strawman instrumentation to
other topics in solar wind science (5.6).

5.2. Spectral Bandpass and Resolution

In Tables 2 and 3 we give the spectral bandpasses
(short and long in the UV range, with count rates ap-
propriate to the quiet solar corona) most appropriate
for testing the theoretical predictions above. They are
similar to the UVCS bandpasses, but with extended
wavelength ranges to observe a wider sample of coro-
nal ions. The long wavelength region has been extended
to include the He II 1640 ˚A multiplet. Lines from S
X and S XI appear in both long and short wavelength
range. These become very important since the only lines
from carbon are C IV which are diﬃcult to compare
with other similar temperature lines, and phosphorus
has a low abundance making its lines intrinsically weak.

understanding solar wind origins, does not strongly con-
strain the required resolution, since spectral line inten-
sities are the main observables. Wave studies are more
demanding in this respect. The H I Lyman α line is typ-

(2013), the radiatively excited component is calculated
as a four dimensional nested integral, integrating over
the frequency overlap between the disk and coronal line
proﬁles, the azimuthal and poloidal angles, φ and θ re-
spectively from point P projecting back to the solar disk,
and ﬁnally the distance along the line of sight. The

alizations, and Raouaﬁ & Solanki (2004) considered de-
viations from radial ﬂow in the solar wind caused by the
super-radial expansion of magnetic ﬁeld lines, though
further discussion is beyond our scope here.

This last approximation is used in calculating the ra-
diative and collisional components of the Li-like dou-
blets, N V, O VI and Ne VIII shown in Fig. 7, and
of the He II 1640.4 and 1084.9 ˚A multiplets, shown in
Fig. 8, both for quiet Sun conditions. In Fig. 7, the
solid curves give the intensity ratio between the two
components of the doublet. In conditions of pure col-
lisional excitation, this is precisely 2. Radiative excita-
tion favors the stronger of the two components, so the
intensity rises above 2 as we move oﬀ-limb, with a the-
oretical maximum in conditions of pure radiative exci-
tation of 4. Above about 3

returns to 2, unless other lines exist in the disk spec-

C II 1036.34/1037.02 ˚A for O VI; see Li et al. 1998)
which move into resonance to continue the radiative ex-
citation. The short dashed lines show the (negative, i.e.
orthogonal to the radial direction) polarization in the
stronger component of the doublet, arising due to the
radiative excitation (e.g. Cranmer 1998).

In Fig. 8 in each case the solid line gives the total
He II line intensity. The long dash lines give the contri-
bution from collisional excitation, the remainder being
radiatively excited by emission from the solar disk in
5p 237.36 ˚A lines
the 1s
for 1640.4 and 1084.9 ˚A respectively. These last pro-
cesses are calculated using line intensities observed by
Malinovsky & Heroux (1973) and Linsky et al. (1976),
with line widths inferred from Brown et al. (2008).
Close to the solar limb collisional excitation dominates.
As the electron density declines moving out into the
corona, collisional excitation proportional to density
squared declines faster than radiative excitation, and
radiative excitation dominates. Even further out, be-
yond 3-4 R⊙ – in this example, the acceleration of the
solar wind has Doppler-shifted the coronal line proﬁle
out of coincidence with the disk emission, and collisional
excitation is again important. Radiative excitation leads
to linear polarization in the line, given by the short dash
curve to be read on the right-hand axis.

The polarization has two eﬀects on the measured line
intensity, compared to the unpolarized case. The ﬁrst is
that the polarized light is emitted anisotropically. This
is included in the calculation using the redistribution
functions given by Cranmer (1998). The second eﬀect
arises if the instrumentation has polarization sensitivity,
which needs to be corrected for. In the usual case, to
be discussed further below, using gratings near normal
incidence, (the grating is the dominant polarization sen-
sitive component), we estimate a polarization sensitivity
of only a few %, which when observing a line polarized to
10-20 % leads to errors in the intensity measurement of
order 1%. This is well below other uncertainties (mainly
counting statistics), and so is considered negligible from
here on. A future experiment to measure the polariza-
tion in the He II lines could be directly interpreted in
terms of the acceleration of the He component of the
solar wind.

The coronal He abundance (Laming & Feldman 2001;
2003) is also a key diagnostic of solar wind acceleration.
Rakowski & Laming (2012) showed that He abundance
variations also result from the ponderomotive force that
generates the FIP fractionation. Kasper et al. (2007;

2012) ﬁnd extreme He abundance variations in the slow-
est speed solar wind near solar minimum. There is a
complex interplay between the heating, acceleration and
wave absorption by helium (e.g., Kasper et al. 2008;
Bourouaine et al. 2011, 2013; Chandran et al. 2013;
Verscharen et al. 2013) and direct observation of such
complex interplay will provide strong conﬁrmation of
wave driving of the solar wind.

5.4. Abundances and Waves

The discussion above suggests that coronal sources of
the slow speed solar wind may be detectable by their
abundance signature(s). Table 1 summarizes the frac-
tionations expected for fast wind, closed coronal loop,
and slow wind (i.e. open ﬁeld, but with similar magnetic
ﬁeld to the closed loop), in each case for ponderomotive
fractionation alone, and for a combination of pondero-
motive and adiabatic invariant conservation designed to
reproduce the isotopic fractionation seen in Genesis sam-
ple return data. While the basic FIP fractionation can
be similar between material originating in closed loops
or in open ﬁeld region, subtle details like the fractiona-
tion of S, P and C, and also He and Ne can vary. This
is potentially an important diagnostic. The slow solar
wind is believed to originate in interchange reconnection
between closed and open ﬁeld, and the released wind
should have have a composition determined by the rela-
tive amounts of originally closed and open ﬁeld plasma
that ultimately are released. The S abundance mea-
surements of Giammanco et al. (2007a,b) suggest that
this is indeed the case, falling as they do between our
closed loop and open ﬁeld slow solar wind models. We
therefore expect He, C, Ne, P and S, the elements that
change the most between the closed loop and slow wind
models in Table 1, to be the most important element
abundances to study.

To estimate the potential instrument performance, let
us consider the requirement for detecting a factor of two
change in the S or He abundance. The most intense
lines of S are the S X 1196.217 and 1212.932 ˚A lines in
the FUV bandpass, where the eﬀective area is usually
highest. Assuming a 10” slit at 1.5R⊙, the solar wind
is moving at 20 km s−1 and takes 375 s to cross the slit
ﬁeld of view. Taking 100 counts (very conservative) in
each line as a minimum to detect a factor of two change,
and an eﬀective area of 0.2 cm2, this can be done in 375 s
10−9 rad, or approximately
within a solid angle of 3.7
12.5”. The He II 1640.4 ˚A multiplet is less in-
12.5”
tense, and falls in a region of lower throughput, leading
to about an order of magnitude less signal, or meaning-
ful abundance measurements when integrated over 10”
100” solid angle. At 2R⊙ heliocentric distance, the

Note—p.o.s. = plane of sky; l.o.s. = line of sight

line intensities are two orders of magnitude lower. The
eﬀective area, however, could be higher and a wider slit
would lead to about one order of magnitude higher count
rate.

5.5. Direct Wave Observations with Two Slits

The diﬀerent regimes of the solar wind are known to be
distinguishable by their turbulence and wave character-
istics (e.g. Bruno & Carbone 2013; Ko et al. 2018). The
fast wind shows mainly Alfv´enic, but unbalanced turbu-
lence, while the slow wind is more balanced, but less
Alfv´enic. These characteristics match naively with the
thought that FIP fractionated slow wind originates in
closed coronal loops, where the balanced turbulence is a
relic of that trapped in the loop, while relatively unfrac-
tionated fast wind originates from open ﬁeld where, with
Alfv´en waves propagating up from the chromosphere,
the turbulence is naturally unbalanced.

However the solar wind is not so simple. Interchange
reconnection between open and closed ﬁeld is necessary
to allow the plasma originally contained in loops to es-
cape (e.g. Antiochos et al. 2011). And as we have shown
above (subsection 2.6), the high S abundance in the slow
speed solar wind appears to require nonresonant waves,
most plausibly from an open ﬁeld region. The double
slit geometry outlined above would allow us to make di-
rect observations of waves, and assess their frequency,
wavenumber, mode, cross-helicity, etc.

Table 4 summarizes the observational properties of the
various MHD wave modes, and how they might be iden-
tiﬁed from variations in line centroid, width and inten-
sity. Simultaneous observations in two slits also allows
inferences on direction of motion and cross-helicity (i.e.
degree to which waves are “balanced”). Consider two
counterpropagating waves with amplitudes a ad b,

a exp i (ωt

kz) + b exp i (ωt + kz) =

−

2b exp iωt cos kz + (a

b) exp i (ωt

kz) .

With the ﬁrst slit at z = 0, the signal is

but at a second slit a projected distance L away, the sig-

anced portion of the disturbance produces oscillations is
in phase in both slits. The unbalanced portion produces
a second oscillation in the second slit with phase diﬀer-
ikL. Except when kL = 2π, balanced and un-
ence
balanced waves can be diagnosed, for comparison with
predictions coming from the abundance pattern.

−

Low-frequency coronal waves themselves will be thus
revealed by careful observation of the central region of
the Lyα line proﬁle. Recently, 5-minute Alfv´enic waves
have been detected with the Coronal Multichannel Po-
larimeter (CoMP; Tomczyk et al. 2007) at low heights
where the plasma is collisional, together with Alfv´enic
turbulence in coronal loops (De Moortel et al. 2014; Liu
et al. 2014), and in open ﬁeld (Morton et al. 2015),
albeit with lower amplitudes than expected. McIntosh
& De Pontieu (2012) discuss possible reasons for this,
e.g., the “dilution” of the signal by foreground and back-
ground emission. It is also possible that waves exist with
higher amplitudes at diﬀerent frequencies, as yet unde-
tected. Mancuso & Raymond (2015) detect propagating
kink waves (an almost parallel propagating fast mode
wave) with SOHO/UVCS revealed by Doppler shift os-
cillations in H I Lyα.

5.6. Shock Waves

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) can also drive waves
through the solar corona with important consequences
for SEP acceleration when these steepen into shocks as
the magnetic ﬁeld decreases oﬀ-limb. Two-slit observa-
tions can determine the height of shock formation and
the plasma properties of the pre-CME corona (Raymond
et al. 2003). It is important to correlate the He abun-
dance of the pre-CME corona with the large variations
of He abundance in SEPs. Limits on the Alfv´en and
shock speeds (key parameters in SEP acceleration mod-
els) can be set by detection of the shock arrival at diﬀer-
ent heights as determined by the timing of the increase in
line widths of UV emission lines (Mancuso et al. 2003;
Ciaravella et al. 2006). The angle between the shock

18

Laming et al.

front and the magnetic ﬁeld requires the pre-shock ﬁeld
direction, which can be determined from streamer mor-
phology.

Shocks are seen in white light images because they
compress
the plasma (Vourlidas et al. 2003, 2013;
They appear in UV spectra as
Liu et al. 2017).
drastic increases in line widths due to shock heating
(Mancuso et al. 2002; Vourlidas & Bemporad 2012).
These observations provide the compression ratio in
the shock (a key parameter determining SEP spectral
shape, e.g. Kwon & Vourlidas 2018) and information
about thermal equilibration among electrons, protons
and ions (Bemporad et al. 2014). At high eﬀective area,
a large number of ionization states will be available for
observation with this instrument concept, revealing the
progress of ionization behind the shock consistently and
providing the electron temperature (Ma et al. 2011).
UV spectroscopy can test collisionless theories of multi-
ion shock heating as a function of mass-per-charge (Lee
& Wu 2000; Zimbardo 2011). Polarimetry,
if avail-
able, can also yield inferences on shock microphysics
(Shimoda et al. 2018), following the initial prediction
(Laming 1990) and discovery (Sparks et al. 2015) of po-
larized emission in Hα from collisionless shock waves
in SN 1006.
In the solar case, H I Lyman α, usually
polarized in a North-South direction due to resonant
scattering of disk radiation, will be Doppler shifted out
of resonance with the disk line and become polarized
in a direction along the shock velocity vector, usually
close to East-West, by collisions with the anisotropic
post-shock electron and proton distributions.

Spectroscopy can also shed light into the heating and
acceleration of CMEs. UVCS observations of Fe17+
6 MK) within thin structures trailing CMEs, pro-
(Te ≃
vide evidence for reconnection in current sheets, a key
prediction of many CME initiation models (Ciaravella et
al. 2002; Lin et al. 2015). Other UVCS measurements
show that the thermal energy is comparable or can even
exceed the CME kinetic energy (Akmal et al. 2001;
Murphy et al. 2011). Yet, these observations are few
and far between to allow a detailed investigation of the
energy transfer in eruptive events. An instrument con-
cept with greatly increased sensitivity over the UVCS
telescope will observe many high temperature (multiple
Fe ions from 18+ to 21+) and low-temperature lines (C
3+, Si 3+) that can greatly expand our understanding
of the CME initiation and initial evolution.

6. CONCLUSIONS

Our emerging understanding of FIP fractionation in
terms of the ponderomotive force due to Alfv´en waves,
and improved observations revealing hitherto unex-
pected variations in the abundances of He, S, P, and
C, suggest that we are on the cusp of signiﬁcant break-
throughs in solar wind science. The S, P, C abundance
enhancements can be traced to the diﬀering altitudes
in the chromosphere at which fractionation occurs, and
this in turn can be traced to the diﬀering properties of
the Alfv´en waves causing the fractionation, with respect
to the magnetic structures in which they are propagat-
ing. Relationships should exist between the solar wind
abundances and the nature of the turbulence entrained
within it, a prime example being the cross-helicity or
degree of balance between sunward and anti-sunward
propagating waves. The cross-helicity is a crucial pa-
rameter in the development of a turbulent cascade, by
means of which ﬂuctuations on large scales can be trans-
ferred to smaller and smaller scales until they resonate
with solar ion winds, heating and ultimately accelerat-
ing them.

Multi-slit oﬀ-limb spectroscopy in the EUV and FUV
thus holds great promise for discoveries in solar wind sci-
ence. Following on from the pioneering observations of
SOHO/UVCS, with modern fabrication techniques we
expect an increase of over a factor of 100 in instrument
sensitivity, greatly extending the range of detectable
spectral lines and the height oﬀ-limb at which obser-
vations can be made. Extending the UVCS bandpass
to include the He II 1640 ˚A multiplet will capture He
abundance variations, as well as S and C. Solar wind
acceleration is one of the phenomena associated with
the transition from ﬂuid to collisionless plasma, and it
oﬀers a probe of this third transition layer in the solar
atmosphere.
