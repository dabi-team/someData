ABSTRACT 

We  propose  an  out-of-distribution  detection  method  that 
combines  density  and  restoration-based  approaches  using 
Vector-Quantized  Variational  Auto-Encoders  (VQ-VAEs). 
The VQ-VAE model learns to encode images in a categorical 
latent  space.  The  prior  distribution  of  latent  codes  is  then 
modelled using an Auto-Regressive (AR) model. We found 
that the prior probability estimated by the AR model can be 
useful  for  unsupervised  anomaly  detection  and  enables  the 
estimation  of  both  sample  and  pixel-wise  anomaly  scores. 
The  sample-wise  score  is  defined  as  the  negative  log-
likelihood of the latent variables above a threshold selecting 
highly  unlikely  codes.  Additionally,  out-of-distribution 
images are restored into in-distribution images by replacing 
unlikely latent codes with samples from the prior model and 
decoding  to  pixel  space.  The  average  L1  distance  between 
generated  restorations  and  original  image  is  used  as  pixel-
wise anomaly score. We tested our approach on the MOOD 
challenge datasets, and report higher accuracies compared to 
a standard reconstruction-based approach with VAEs.

1. INTRODUCTION 

A  wide  range  of  methods  using  deep  learning  has  been 
recently  proposed  to  automatically  identify  anomalies  in 
medical  images  [1].  Most  of them  are  based  on  supervised 
learning,  and  consequently  have  two  important  constraints. 
First,  they  require  large  and  diverse  annotated  datasets  for 
training.  Second,  they  are  specific  to  the  abnormalities 
annotated  in  the  datasets,  and  therefore  are  unable  to 
generalize  to  other  pathologies.  Unsupervised  anomaly 
detection methods, on the other hand, aim to overcome these 
constraints by not relying on annotated datasets [2]. Instead, 
they focus on learning the underlying distribution of normal 
images and then identifying as anomalies the images that do 
not conform to the learnt distribution. 

Recently, methods based on Variational Auto-Encoders 
(VAEs)  have  been  proposed  to  identify  and  localize 
anomalies  in  medical  images  [2,3,4].  VAEs  are  generative 

models trained by minimizing a loss function composed of a 
reconstruction term (measuring the distance between original 
images  and  reconstructions)  and  a  Kullback–Leibler  (KL) 
divergence term (measuring the distance between the latent 
distribution and a prior, generally assumed to be Gaussian). 
The default approach consists in using the reconstruction loss 
to identify samples with anomalies, based on the assumption 
that  the  VAE  will  reconstruct  their  anomaly-free  versions. 
However,  recent  results  suggest  that  the  KL  divergence  is 
actually a better anomaly score [3]. This can be caused by the 
high representational power of VAEs, which can reconstruct 
even  (previously  unseen)  anomalies.  In  addition,  in  [4] 
anomalies are modelled as spatially localized deviations from 
a  prior  distribution  of  normal  images.   Gradient  descent  in 
pixel space is used to “restore” images, effectively removing 
anomalies.  Anomalies  are  then  localized  by  comparing 
original images to restorations. Restoration-based approaches 
seem to overall outperform reconstruction-based ones [2].  

Under the hypothesis that abnormal images are encoded 
in  different,  lower  density  regions  in  the  latent  space,  we 
propose to use an estimated latent density as anomaly score. 
Vector-Quantized VAEs (VQ-VAEs) [5] are well suited for 
this strategy because their discrete latent distribution can be 
modelled  with  expressive  Auto-Regressive  (AR)  models, 
which  provide  state  of  the  art  performance  in  density 
estimation  in  images.  Additionally,  we  enable  anomaly 
localization relying on the generative capabilities of the AR 
model,  with  a  method  that  we  refer  to  as  Latent  Space 
Restoration.  Results  obtained  in  the  MOOD  challenge 
datasets (consisting of brain MR and abdominal CT images) 
suggest 
that  our  approach  outperforms  a  standard 
reconstruction-based anomaly detection method using VAEs. 

2. METHODS 

2.1. Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoders 

Vector  Quantized  Variational  Auto-Encoders  (VQ-VAEs) 
[5]  encode  observed  variables  in  a  discrete  latent  space 
instead of a continuous one. The discrete latent space can be 
very expressive, allowing the generation of high quality and 
detailed  reconstructions.  The  discrete  latent  space  also 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
restorations.  In  an  AR  model,  the  joint  probability  is 
modelled using  factorization, meaning  that  each  variable  is 
modelled  as  dependent  from  previous  variables:  𝑝(𝑥) =
∏ 𝑝(𝑥𝑖|𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑖−1)
.  In  our  implementation,  we  used  the 
PixelSNAIL [6] architecture for the AR model.

2.3. Sample-wise anomaly score estimation 

A sample-wise anomaly score is a numerical indicator of 
how likely it is for a given sample to contain an anomaly. 
Scores are generally either density-based (based on an 
estimated probability of a sample) or reconstruction-based 
(based on the assumption that models trained on normal data 
will not be able to reconstruct anomalies). 

Consistent with our previous findings using VAEs,  VQ-
VAE with a large enough latent space are able to reconstruct 
abnormal regions of images and this makes the full VQ-VAE 
loss a poor anomaly score. However, we found that abnormal 
regions translate into unusual latent variables, for which the 
AR model assigns low probability. Therefore, we derived a 
sample  wise  anomaly  score  from  the  prior  probability 
estimated by the AR model. 

A  negative  log-likelihood  (NLL)  threshold  𝜆𝑠  defines 
highly  unlikely  latent  variables.  The  proposed  sample-wise 
anomaly  score  (𝐴𝑆sample)  is  the  sum  of  NLL  of  the  latent 
variables above threshold (over a total of 𝑁 variables):

𝜉(𝑧) =   {

− log(𝑧), if −log(𝑧) > 𝜆𝑠
0,  otherwise

2.4. Pixel-wise anomaly score estimation 

Pixel-wise  anomaly  scores  quantify,  for  each  pixel  in  an 
image, its likelihood of containing an anomaly, consequently 
providing anomaly localization. 

The  proposed  pixel-wise  score  follows  the  restoration 
paradigm presented in [4]. Our restoration method consists in 
replacing  high  loss  latent  variables  with  samples  from  the 
learnt  prior AR model and keeping low loss latent variable 
unaltered.    New  samples  are  drawn  only  when  their  latent 
NLL  is  above  a  threshold  λp.  Fig.  2  illustrates  this  process 
(that  we  refer  to  as  “Latent  Space  Restoration”).  The 
restoration image is then generated with the decoder network, 
and the residual image is computed as |𝑋 − Restoration|. 

Multiple restorations (j ∈ 1,2,...,S) are generated for each 
test image to reduce variance in the anomaly estimation. The 
multiple residual images are consolidated using a weighting 
𝑖|
factor wj defined as: 𝑤𝑗 = softmax(𝑘 / ∑ |Y𝑖 − 𝑋𝑗
), where 
k is a softmax temperature parameter and the sum is over all 
the  image  pixels  P.  w  reduces  the  weight  of  restorations 
which  have  lost  consistency.  The  final  consolidated  pixel-
wise  anomaly  score  (𝐴𝑆pixel)  is  estimated  as  the  weighted 
mean of all residuals:

discrete keys to a D-dimensional embedding space. In other 
words, the encoder  network maps observed variables to the 
embedding  space,  𝑧𝑒(𝑥)   ∈   R𝐷.  Differently  from  standard 
VAEs,  for  which  the  posterior  𝑞(𝑧|𝑥)  follows  a  Gaussian 
distribution,  the  posterior  in  VQ-VAEs  is  categorical  and

Given  that  the  argmin  operator  is  non-differentiable,  the 
gradient  in  the  encoder  is  usually  approximated  using 
straight-through estimator [5]. Additional terms  in the VQ-
VAE loss function are introduced to provide gradients to the 
embeddings  and  to  incentivize  the  encoder  to  commit  to 
embeddings.  The  complete  VQ-VAE  loss  function  is 
therefore defined as

2.2. Auto-Regressive prior modelling 

In  our  method,  the  prior  distribution  of  VQ-VAE  is  learnt 
using  an  Auto-Regressive  model  (AR).  This  will  allow  the 
estimation of the probability of samples and consequently the 
identification of anomalies (defined as samples associated to 
low probability). In addition, since AR models are generative, 
they enable the iterative sampling of one variable at a time, a

3. EXPERIMENTS 

3.1. Datasets 

MOOD challenge  [7] datasets  have been used to train and 
evaluate the proposed method. They consist of 

•  Brain  MR:  800  scans  obtained  from  the  Human 
Connectome  Project  (HCP)  dataset  [8].  HCP 
incorporates only young healthy participants;  

•  Abdominal CT: 550 normal scans from [9]. 

The challenge test set is kept confidential. However, images 
from  4  subjects  for  each  dataset  with  added  synthetic 
anomalies were provided as validation set and used for hyper-
parameter  tunning.  Results  listed  in  the  following  section 
correspond to this validation set.  

Both datasets are pre-processed according to guidelines 
from  challenge  organizers.  Images  were  resized  to  obtain 
axials  slices  of  160x160  pixels.  Brain 
images  were 
normalized  to  have  zero  mean  and  unit  standard  deviation 
subject-wise.  Image  augmentation  used  in  the  training  set 
included elastic transforms, gaussian blur, random scale and 
rotations,  random  brightness,  contrast  adjustment  and 
gaussian noise. 

3.2. Implementation details 

Our VQ-VAE includes 5 blocks, each composed of 4 residual 
blocks  and  a  downsample/upsample  operator.  The  latent 
space in the brain dataset was set to 20x20 with an embedding 
space with 128 keys and 256 dimensions. The latent space in 
the abdominal dataset was set to 10x10. L1 distance was used 
as  reconstruction  loss.  Additionally,  dropout  with  0.1 
probability is used during training.  

PixelSNAIL network consists of 4 blocks, each with 4 
residual  blocks  and  a  self-attention  module.  Latent 
probability  distribution  was  conditioned  on  the  axial  slice 
position.  Consequently,  in  order  to  estimate  a  sample 

probability,  the  AR  model  receives  as  input  not  only  the 
encoded sample but also the position of the slice within the 
volume, encoded in a variable in the range [-0.5,0.5]. Dropout 
with 0.1 probability is used during training. 

Network  architectures  and  training  procedures  were 
implemented  in  PyTorch  and  made  openly  available  in 
https://github.com/snavalm/lsr_mood_challenge_2020/.  

Adam  optimizer  (with  parameters  β1=0.9,  β2=0.999, 
ε=10−8) and learning rate of 10−4 were used to train both VQ-
VAE and PixelSNAIL networks.  A batch size of 64 was used 
in  both  networks.  Batches  were  created  by  combining  8 
random  slices  from  8  volumes.  VQ-VAE  was  first  trained. 
The  trained  encoder  was  then  used  to  generate  the  latent 
variables  fed  to  PixelSNAIL,  which  was  consequently 
trained. Networks were trained on a single Nvidia GTX1070. 
Finally,  λ𝑠  and  λ𝑝  thresholds  were  adjusted  using  the 
validation set provided (slice-wise performance was used for 
λs).  We  used  λ𝑠 = 7 and λ𝑝 = 5 ,  corresponding 
to 
percentiles 98 and 90 respectively in the validation set. In the 
pixel-wise score, we found that a lower threshold incentivizes 
more  variance  in  reconstructions  which  improved  results. 
𝑆 = 15  restorations was also heuristically determined. 

We  compare  our  method  to  a  standard  VAE  with  the 
same architecture as the VQ-VAE (5 downsample/upsample 
blocks,  each  with  4  residual  blocks).  A  dense  layer  is 
incorporated as the final layer of the encoder to define a 128 
latent  space.  VAE  loss  is  used  as  sample-wise  AS  and 
reconstruction as pixel-wise AS.  

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Since  only  4  volumes  are  provided  for  each  dataset,  we 
approximated the sample-wise performance using slice-wise 
performance  metrics.  Slice  and  pixel-wise  results  for  our 
method  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  Area  under  receiver 
operating  characteristics  curve  (AUROC)  and  average 
precision (AP) are reported for sample and pixel wise scores. 
In  pixel-wise  score  we  additionally  evaluated  the  Dice 
similarity coefficient (DSC) by  identifying abnormal pixels 
with an AS threshold. We include examples of the sample-
wise scores assigned by our method in Fig. 3. For pixel-wise 
scores,  Fig.  4  shows  one  validation  image,  2  of  the  15 
restorations generated, residuals and final anomaly score.

Table 1. Comparative of slice and pixel-wise performance.  

The  obtained  results  suggest 

that  our  approach 
outperforms a standard VAE method. Pixel-wise results are 
superior  in  brain  images  compared  to  abdominal  (probably 
due to the higher variance in the abdominal dataset). We also 
observed that the method is sensitive to the pixel intensity of 
the  anomaly.  Anomalies  with  intensities  near  the  expected 
intensities are often missed. This can be due to the anomaly 
scored  being  calculated  as  the  residual  of  pixel  intensities. 
Alternative scores will be evaluated in the future. 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

We  presented  a  novel  unsupervised  anomaly  detection  and 
localization method based on VQ-VAEs that improves results 
upon  an  existing  standard  VAE  approach.  In  the  MOOD 
challenge,  our  approach  achieved  2nd  and  3rd  position  in 
sample and pixel-wise respectively, only surpassed by non-
VAE-based methods. In the future, we intend to evaluate our 
approach  in  a  broader  range  of  datasets  and  medical 
anomalies to better assess its robustness and usefulness in a 
realistic scenario.
