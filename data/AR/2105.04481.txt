One strategy for arresting propagating detonation waves in pipes is by imposing a sudden area enlargement,
which provides a rapid lateral divergence of the gases in the reaction zone and attenuates the leading shock.
For suﬃciently small tube diameter, the detonation decays to a deﬂagration and the shock decays to negligible
strengths. This is known as the critical tube diameter problem. In the present study, we provide a closed form
model to predict the detonation quenching for 2D channels. Whitham’s geometric shock dynamics, coupled
with a shock evolution law based on shocks sustained by a constant source obtained by the shock change
equations of Radulescu, is shown to capture the lateral shock dynamics response to the failure wave originating
at the expansion corner. A criterion for successful detonation transmission to open space is that the lateral
strain rate provided by the failure wave not exceed the critical strain rate of steady curved detonations. Using
the critical lateral strain rate obtained by He and Clavin, a closed form solution is obtained for the critical
channel opening permitting detonation transmission. The predicted critical channel width is found in very
good agreement with our recent experiments and simulations of diﬀracting H2/O2/Ar detonations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

When a detonation wave emerges from a tube or chan-
nel into an open space, the sudden expansion of the
gases in the reaction zone of the detonation wave decou-
ples the reaction zone from the shock near the corner1.
If the opening is suﬃciently small, the detonation can
completely degenerate into a weak shock followed by a
deﬂagration wave. This so-called critical tube diameter
problem, or critical channel height in 2D, has attracted
much interest since the pioneering work of Zel’dovich,
Kogarko, and Simonov 2, due to its practical importance
in detonation initiation or quenching applications. For
gaseous detonations, a review of the state of the art
can be found in the PhD thesis of Schultz 3 for work
prior to 2000, while a discussion of the more recent lit-
terature appears in the notable contributions of Jones
et al. 4, Meredith, Ng, and Lee 5 , Sorin et al. 6 , Kha-
sainov et al. 7 , Nagura et al. 8 , Li et al. 9 , Shi, Uy, and
Wen 10, Gallier et al. 11, Pintgen and Shepherd 12, Yuan
et al. 13, Li et al. 14. While this list is not exhaustive,
the scope of our present communication is not to pro-
vide a critical review of the vast available litterature on
the subject. We note however that in spite of numerous
eﬀorts in modeling the diﬀraction process, a predictive
model for the critical tube diameter is still lacking15–17.
The prime objective of the present communication is to
formulate such a model.

The lack of a predictive model is due in part to the
presence of a cellular structure of the front of all det-
onations, which modiﬁes the reaction zone structure of
detonations and its sensitivity to the global expansion
during the diﬀraction process, as recently shown by Xiao
and Radulescu 18. For example, a unique signature of the
transverse wave structure of detonations is the anoma-
lous scaling of the diﬀraction process between the 2D
channel problem and 3D axisymmetric problem, as ﬁrst
noted by Radulescu 19 when reviewing previous data, and
subsequently conﬁrmed experimnetally by Meredith, Ng,
and Lee 5 . This anomalous scaling of a tube diameter to
channel width greater than 2 cannot be reconciled with
curvature based criteria for failure and extensions to in-
clude non-steady eﬀects20, and is beleived to be a unique
feature of unstable cellular detonations. Recovering the
correct scaling can be deemed the ultimate acid test for
any theoretical model of diﬀraction for unstable deto-
nations. Recently, however, Meredith, Ng, and Lee 5 and
Radulescu and Lee 21 in porous walled tubes, have shown
that only weakly unstable detonations waves do obey the
ideal curvature-based scaling, substantiating Lee’s claim
of the failure mechanism being associated with a criti-
cal curvature22. This ideal curvature based scaling was
veriﬁed numerically by Li et al. 9 for weakly unstable det-
onations. The present study addresses whether a curva-
ture based prediction of critical transmission is compati-
ble with experiments in weakly unstable detonations and
can quantitatively predict the critical diﬀraction condi-
tions.

Recent work by Xiao and Radulescu 23 in slowly enlarg-
ing channels has shown that the quasi-steady dynamics

of such weakly unstable cellular hydrogen detonations
at low pressure, which are characterized by much longer
reaction zones as compared to induction zones, can be
well captured by the predictions of the ZND model with
curvature23 and neglect of the cellular structure.
It is
thus of interest to verify whether the diﬀraction process
in these same mixtures can be equally well predicted
by neglecting the inﬂuence of the cellular structure for
these conditions using a critical curvature criterion, as
suggested by Lee 22. The model we formulate, based
on a maximum permissible curvature, is thus meant for
weakly unstable detonations. This is the ﬁrst step to-
wards predicting the behavior of more unstable detona-
tions, as it can serve as a benchmark for more unstable
conditions.

The prediction of the critical conditions for transmis-
sion in open space of a detonation wave requires model-
ing the dynamics of the diﬀracting detonations and the
distribution of transverse ﬂow strain rate (i.e., curva-
ture times ﬂow speed) behind the lead shock. Previ-
ous studies have shown that the reaction zone decou-
ples from the lead shock behind a failure wave prop-
agating to the axis1,24. The shape of the de-coupled
shock wave was shown to be approximately self-similar
by Bartlma and Schroder 25, and approximately captured
by Whitham’s geometrical shock dynamics theory for
inert shock waves26. Arienti compared the curvature
predicted by the model of Whitham with his computa-
tions and found it under-predicted the wave curvature16.
Wescott, Stewart and Bdzil (henceforth WSB) have ex-
tended Whitham’s characteristic rule to under-driven
detonation waves by assuming quasi-steady dynamics
and a reaction zone with an embedded sonic surface, but
did not compare their predictions to gaseous diﬀracting
detonations with sensible shock sensitivity permitting lo-
cal extinction27. Recently, we have conducted detailed
numerical simulations and experiments of diﬀracting det-
onations in weakly unstable 2H2+O2+2Ar detonations28.
In this study, we wish to compare the predictions of
Whitham and WSB curvature distribution behind the
diﬀracting detonation waves with our recent experiments
and simulations.

While both Whitham’s and the WSB models will be
shown to provide an adequate approximation for the lat-
eral strain rate distribution required for predicting fail-
ure, we also introduce a novel self-similar approximation
for the shock dynamics weakly supported by the motion
of the detonation products. This model provides an im-
proved prediction for the detonation dynamics. Combin-
ing the prediction of lateral strain rate and the maximum
strain rate obtained for steady waves29–31, we obtain a
closed form expression for the critical channel height for
detonation transmission. We show that the closed form
prediction for detonation failure is in excellent agreement
with the simulations and good agreement with experi-
ment.

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst brieﬂy re-
view our previous numerical results and experiments. We

then compare the detonation dynamics with the predic-
tions of Whitham’s Geometrical Shock Dynamics using
the Whitham and Westcott’s truncations utilizing the
characteristic rule, as well as our weakly supported shock
model. We conclude by formulating the critical diﬀrac-
tion model based on a maximum curvature and its com-
parison with experiment and simulations.

II. NUMERICS AND EXPERIMENTS

Our recent detonation diﬀraction experiments and
simulations in 2H2+O2+2Ar are discussed in detail
elsewhere11,28. The numerical simulations were per-
formed using a realistic chemical kinetic scheme for hy-
drogen combustion using AMR (Adaptive Mesh Reﬁne-
ment) with a minimum grid spacing of 7 µm. This reso-
lution of 7 µm corresponds to 40 to 90 grid points in the
induction length (depending on pressure), which is well
above usual recommendations. Given that low pressure
hydrogen detonations have reaction zones longer than
the induction zones by an order of magnitude, and half-
reaction zone lengths 2-3 times larger than the induction
zone length23, our eﬀective resolution is on the order of
100 to 200 grid points per half reaction length. For refer-
ence, the recently reported state of the art simulations of
Shi, Uy, and Wen 10 used only 24 grid points per half re-
action length, a limitation imposed by the lack of AMR.
We have tested the convergence of the calculations in
straight channels for three diﬀerent resolutions (7, 14 and
28 µm) in wide channels permitting up to 10 cells and
no eﬀects on cell size were observed. The eﬀect of grid
resolution on the diﬀraction behavior was not performed
due to limitation in computational resources.

Figure 1 shows three examples of supercritical, critical
and subcritical diﬀraction obtained in the numerics. For
a ﬁxed geometry, at a suﬃciently low pressure and long
reaction zone (row a), the detonation wave is quenched
by a lateral failure wave originating at the corner, which
penetrates to the axis of symmetry. The shock and re-
action zone de-couple and decay. This is the classical
failure dynamics observed in the past experiments and
simulations with realistic parameters of gas phase deto-
nations, as also recently documented in detail by Gallier
et al. 11, Pintgen and Shepherd 12. At a suﬃciently high
pressure and short reaction zone (row c), the failure wave
cannot penetrate to the axis and the detonation wave
never extinguishes on the axis. Instead, it continues to
propagate with a cellular structure. At critical conditions
intermediate to the two others (row b in the ﬁgure), re-
inititiation is observed through the ampliﬁcation of lat-
eral hotspots, previously observed and analyzed by Jones
et al. 4, Shi, Uy, and Wen 10, Arienti and Shepherd 24.
The experiments showed very similar dynamics. Close
to the limit, the failure wave does not penetrate to the
axis and a curved detonation wave survives quenching
(Fig. 2). At the limit (Fig. 3), re-initiation occurs from
a transverse wave ampliﬁcation into a transverse deto-

identiﬁable by the protuberance on the failing detona-
tion front, can be traced back to the axis in subﬁgure
a), which also coincides closely to the failure wave ar-
rival at the top wall. In this sense, this critical experi-
ment oﬀers a magnifying glass on the critical dynamics of
diﬀraction. The detonation wave survives quenching by
the ampliﬁcation of transverse modes over a length scale
comparable to the original channel width, signifying that

the phenomena controlling sustenance are not strictly lo-
cal. The local hotspot formation was analyzed by Jones
et al. 4 , Shi, Uy, and Wen 10, Arienti and Shepherd 24. Of
interest, Arienti 16 further pursued this analysis in the
context of Strehlow’s ray trapping theory32. While this
avenue of research appears very worthwhile in explain-
ing the details of the re-initiation mode and the build-up
of transverse waves, how the cellular structure impacts

fusion assists the auto-ignition phenomena18, this is left
for future study. Table I provides a summary of the limits
observed experimentally and numerically in terms of the
ratio between the channel bi-thickness W normalized by
the ZND induction zone length. For reducing the experi-
ments, since the detonation prior to diﬀraction was found
to propagate at a speed lower than CJ due to wall losses,
the channel width was normalized by the induction zone
length calculated for the conditions of the weaker lead
shock. The numerical limit of W(cid:63)/∆i = 176 was found
approximately 30% lower than the experiments, where
W(cid:63)/∆i varied between 200 and 260. This variability in
the experiments is due to the stochasticity, which can be
attributed to the cellular structure controlling the details
of the limiting phenomena, as illustrated in Fig. 3, for ex-
ample.

III. WHITHAM’S SELF-SIMILAR GSD SOLUTION FOR
THE SHOCK CURVATURE DISTRIBUTION

Whitham’s geometric shock dynamics (GSD) provides
a simple framework to predict the dynamics of shocks
aﬀected by changes in the shock inclination angles,
such as diﬀraction, as well as determine the curvature
evolution26. For generic local shock evolution equations

V. THE EXPONENT n FROM SHOCK EVOLUTION
EQUATIONS

An exact solution for decaying shock waves yielding the
exponent n is not currently available. Physically based
approximations have been proposed, and we brieﬂy re-
view those relevant for the present problem of diﬀraction.
Whitham’s model for the shock evolution equation is ob-
tained by projecting the shock state changes along the
trajectory of a C+ characteristic. This model applies to
shock waves for which the rear boundary conditions play
a negligible inﬂuence on the shock dynamics. For strong
shocks, Whitham26 obtains the exponent n given by:

n = nW = 1 +

γ

+

(cid:114) 2γ
γ − 1

(10)

For γ = 1.4, corresponding to the post shock state in
the experiments and numerics discussed above, this ex-
ponent is 5.07. The predictions of the decoupled deto-
nation are shown in the Figs. 1, 2 and 3 as the orange
curves. The model is in fair agreement with the experi-
ments and numerics. Note that the Whitham exponent
is sometimes erroneously quoted with + in the square
root instead of the −. This unfortunate typographical er-
ror in Bartlma and Schroder25 has persisted in the more
modern literature34. Using the incorrect exponent leads
to better agreement with simulations and experiments,
but a purely fortuitous one. The characteristic rule has
also been applied to underdriven detonations relevant to
diﬀraction problems by Wescott et al.27. Their model as-
sumes the detonation in quasi-steady state, and requires
an embedded sonic surface. The resulting exponent n of
their model for sonic under-driven detonations is:

n = nW BS = 3

(cid:19)

(cid:18) γ + 1
γ

(11)

The model reproduces one of the limits obtained by more
rigorous perturbation methods by Yao and Stewart33.
Again, this exponent has unfortunately also been re-
ported erroneously (as the inverse of this expression
above) in the paper of Wescott et al. For γ = 1.4, cor-
responding to the post shock state in the experiments
and numerics discussed above, the correct exponent is
5.14, i.e., almost identical to the inert shock model of
Whitham. The shock prediction using this model is
shown in blue; it provides the same fair agreement as
the Whitham model for this value of γ, although they
model fundamentally diﬀerent phenomena. The charac-
teristic rule adopted in the previous two models is aimed

7

to model the dynamics of shock waves not inﬂuenced by
rear boundary conditions. This is physically inconsis-
tent with the dynamics observed in experiments. For the
detonation diﬀraction problem, the arrival of the failure
wave quenches the chemical reactions by sudden ﬂow ex-
pansion. The shock is subsequently partially supported
by the motion of the products, which act as a piston and
inﬂuence the shock dynamics, at least in the region im-
mediately adjacent to the arrival of the failure wave and
conducive to reaction quenching. This situation was ana-
lyzed for pulsed sources by Chekmarev35 and Radulescu
and Law36 in the context of jets issuing from ﬁnite sized
sources. These authors have found two asymptotic be-
haviors, the near ﬁeld dynamics of the shock were con-
trolled by the source outﬂow speed, while the far ﬁeld was
controlled by the free dynamics of the mass layer bounded
by inner and outer facing shocks. The early dynamics of
the failed detonation fronts can be argued to correspond
to the former class. In the detonation problem, a rear
facing shock is not formed, while for the diﬀraction of
a purely inert shock, the rear facing shock is formed to
match the post shock state to the supersonic expansion.
Indeed, the ﬂow in the lab frame following a detonation
is subsonic, whereas it is supersonic for a strong inert
shock. Based on these physical considerations, a physi-
cal model for shock dynamics in supported shocks is to
assume that there is no time variation in the piston sup-
port of the products, mimicking a constant rear support.
Radulescu has recently derived an exact expression link-
ing ∂u
∂t immediately behind the shock with the local dy-
namics of curved shocks using Fickett and Davis’ shock
change equations37. For strong inert shocks, this local
balance can be written as

To model the weak support provided by the detonation
products upon arrival of the failure wave, we assume the
evolution of the rear support to vary slower than the
shock wave response to area changes, i.e., we neglect the
term on the left-hand-side of this equation. This resulting
local quasi-steady approximation for the motion of the
piston leads to a simple evolution equation for the shock
of the desired form (1), with n given by

n = nR = 2

(cid:19)

(cid:18) γ + 1

(13)

For γ = 1.4, corresponding to the post shock state in the
experiments and numerics discussed above, this exponent
is 3.43. The shock dynamics predicted by this truncation
for the shock dynamics are shown in green in Figs. 1, 2
and 3. The simple model is found in very good agree-
ment with both the simulations and experiment. It can
thus serve to evaluate the lateral strain rate behind the
shock when the failure wave reaches the axis, as discussed
above. We note that the truncation suggested was not
derived through a rational derivation using a systematic

multi-scale approach. We note that Whitham’s model
and the WSB model, and more generally all truncations
of this type, are physically justiﬁed but do not derive
systematically from ﬁrst principles. Their good perfor-
mance in shock and detonation diﬀraction applications
clearly warrants a future eﬀort to derive these approxi-
mations from ﬁrst principles. For its further numerical
validation, future work should also attempt to evaluate
each of the terms in (12) in a ray tube perpendicular to
the mean shock locus in order to evaluate the accuracy
of the balance suggested. This would necessitate taking
ensemble averages of multiple realizations for achieving
a coarse-grained description at a hydrodynamic scale, as
attempted in the past in stationary problems by Rad-
ulescu et al. 38 and Reynaud, Virot, and Chinnayya 39.
The non-stationarity of the present problem makes this
exercise much more diﬃcult, and it is left for future study.
To further illustrate however how the detonation diﬀrac-
tion problem diﬀers from the problem of diﬀraction of an
inert shock, we have computed numerically the diﬀrac-
tion of a Mach M = 5 shock for γ = 1.4, the same
parameters as for the reactive case. The self-similar den-
sity ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 6, along with the predictions
of shock dynamics discussed above. Clearly, for the in-
ert shock dynamics, the shock shape is well captured by
the Whitham characteristic rule. Note however the barrel
shock system that separates the supersonic steady expan-
sion of the ﬂow passing the corner and the gas layered
between the inner and outer facing shocks, whose dynam-
ics dictate the shock evolution. This is fundamentally
diﬀerent from the detonation diﬀraction process, where
these elements are absent and are replaced by a wall vor-
tex. The discussion of the shock dynamics predicted by
diﬀerent physics has shown that the shape of the diﬀract-
ing shock is weakly dependent on which model is used,
since the conditions immediately behind the shock aﬀect
its motion. More fundamentally, while the diﬀraction
process is not expected to be strictly self-similar, as the
local front is more likely well approximated by the WSB
model close to the axis where the reactions are still cou-
pled, our model when reactions decouple and the shock is
weakly supported by the motion of the detonation prod-
ucts, and the Whitham inert model further from the axis
for free-decay, the close coincidence of these exponents
suggests quasi-self similarity. For engineering purposes,
taking any of them should be satisfactory. Neverthe-
less, a formal multi-scale analysis is warranted in the
framework of the theory of Detonation Shock Dynam-
ics of Bdzil and Stewart 20 formulated for a kinetic law
compatible with the long reaction zone character of hy-
drogen detonations and activated induction zone, such as
the model investigated by Short and Bdzil 40. This is well
outside the scope of the present discussion, which aims
at formulating an approximate transmission criterion.

VI. TRANSMISSION CRITERION

With the exponent n in closed form from the diﬀer-
ent approximations discussed above, the critical chan-
nel height for detonation transmission to open space can
be obtained in closed form by substituting the expres-
sions for n given above in (9). For our model with quasi-
constant rear support, negligible non-steady eﬀects and
negligible transverse wave structure,

Similar expressions can be obtained using the other ex-
pressions for the constant n. For the 2H2+O2+2Ar mix-
ture tested, the postshock γ is 1.4 and the reduced ac-
tivation energy is 4.4, obtained from the sensitivity of
the ignition delay to temperature changes at the Von
Neuman state using Cantera for the calculations. The
resulting predictions of critical channel width using the
diﬀerent values of n are shown in Table 1, along with
the experimental and numerical values obtained in our
previous experiments and simulations discussed above.
The weakly supported shock model predicts the critical
value obtained from the simulations with an error of less
than 7%. The predictions based on Whitham and West-
cott et al. models for the shock dynamics underestimate
the critical channel width by 17%, which is also quite re-

for which the limit is approximately 30% larger than for
the numerics.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The proposed model for critical detonation diﬀraction
relies on the prediction of the wave curvature eﬀected by
the failure wave originating from the diﬀraction corner.
While the models of Whitham and Westcott, Bdzil and
Stewart are found to predict these dynamics fairly well,
we propose an improvement on the shock dynamic pre-
diction using a weakly supported shock model, which is
found in very good agreement with experiment and sim-
ulations. Using these simple estimates for the maximum
wave curvature attained when the failure waves meet
the axis, a simple criterion for successful transmission is
that this curvature not exceed the maximum curvature
that can be sustained by a curved detonation in quasi-
steady state. The closed form limits obtained for the
critical diﬀraction channel height are found in very good
agreement with numerics and under-predict the experi-
ments by approximately 40%. While the present study
suggests that the diﬀraction of weakly unstable detona-
tions are well predicted by the maximum curvature of a
steady ZND detonation, future work should address how
this prediction performs in much more unstable detona-
tions, where non-steady eﬀects become more prominent41
and the turbulent structure of the reaction zone pro-
vides a mechanism to enhance the ignition process18. In-
deed, detonation attenuation with controlled side relief
in porous walled tubes19,21 and weakly divergent tubes18
showed that the curved ZND model predictions fail with
increasing instability.
