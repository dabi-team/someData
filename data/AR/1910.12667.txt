Abstract 

The  successful  application  of  titanium  oxide-graphene  hybrids  in  the  fields  of 
photocatalysis,  photovoltaics  and  photodetection  strongly  depends  on  the  interfacial 
contact  between  both  materials.  The  need  to  provide  a  good  coupling  between  the 
enabling conductor and the photoactive phase prompted us to directly grow conducting 
graphenic structures on TiO2 crystals. We here report on the direct synthesis of tailored 
graphenic structures by using Plasma Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition that present 
a clean junction with the prototypical titanium oxide (110) surface. Chemical analysis of 
the  interface  indicates  chemical  bonding  between  both  materials.  Photocurrent 
measurements under UV light illumination manifest that the charge transfer across the 
interface is efficient. Moreover, the influence of the synthesis atmosphere, gas precursor 
(C2H2)  and  diluents  (Ar,  O2),  on  the  interface  and  on  the  structure  of  the  as-grown 
graphenic material is assessed. The inclusion of O2 promotes vertical growth of partially 
oxidized carbon nanodots/rods with controllable height and density. The deposition with 
Ar  results  in  continuous  graphenic  films  with  low  resistivity  (ρ=6.8·10-6  Ω·m).  The 
tailored  carbon-
synthesis  protocols  developed  here  are  suitable 
semiconductor  structures  on  a  variety  of  practical  substrates  as  thin  films,  pillars  or 
nanoparticles.

1.  Introduction 

Since  the  discovery  of  the  photo-activity  of  TiO2  under  UV  light  irradiation  [1,  2] 

significant  efforts  have  been  made  to  develop  strategies  that  enhance  its  “photonic 

efficiency” or light-to-current conversion capability. The efficiency is usually hindered 

by the high recombination rate (>90%) of electrons and holes inside the material [3-6] 

before  their  diffusion  to  the  surface,  where  the  generated  charges  can  be  extracted  or 

expected to promote chemical (redox) reactions [7, 8].  

Stimulated  by  the  pioneering  work  of  Kamat  and  co-workers  [9],  several  attempts 

have  been  made  to  combine  graphene  or  other  carbon  materials  with  TiO2  to  obtain 

platforms  that  minimize  the  recombination  rate  [10,  11].  It´s  worth  mentioning  that 

recent reports strongly manifest that the use of graphene in the nanoscale is in essence 

the  same  as  using  other  carbon  (nanotubes  or  activated  carbon)  materials  on 

enhancement  of  photoactivity  of  TiO2[12].  Recently,  graphene  and  graphene  oxide 

mesoscopic flakes with intrinsic defects were successfully used as doping agents to the 

mesoporous TiO2 electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells, boosting the power 

conversion  efficiency  of  the  device  [13].  The  use  of  graphene  or  carbon  structures  in 

contact with the semiconductor under light exposure results in an efficient separation of 

the  yielded  charge  carriers  across  the  interface  of  both  materials  [14-17].  The 

combination  of  carbon  materials  with  TiO2  also  improves  its  molecular  adsorption 

capabilities  and  widens  its  light  absorption  range,  therefore,  enhancing  the  overall 

performance [8, 18-20].  

A  high  quality  interface  between  carbon  and  TiO2  free  of  recombination  centers, 

such  as  adsorbates  or  contamination,  and  with  a  well  established  chemical  contact 

between  both  materials  is  critical  for  charge  separation  [16,  20].  Importantly,  the 

properties  of  the  interface  are  strongly  depending  on  the  synthetic  route  [21,  22]. 

Recently,  chemical  vapor  deposition  (in  atmospheric  pressure  and  with  thermal 

activation)  has  been  used  to  directly  deposit  contamination-free  graphitic  carbon 

coatings  either  on  TiO2  single  crystals,  as  a  model  system  [7],  and  on  TiO2 

nanoparticles [23] that may present a direct application in photocatalysis [24]. However, 

the initial stages of carbon nucleation and growth direction of the carbon phase on the 

TiO2 substrate are aspects not assessed in these works. In close relation to this, a recent 

theoretical report [25] depicted a scenario in which vertical arrangement of mesoscopic 

2	

	
 
 
 
graphene sheets on the substrate may enhance charge separation properties. This work 

emphasizes the need of “vertical” or columnar growth with interfacial chemical bonds 

for  more  efficient  charge  transfer  processes  in  comparison  with  graphene-TiO2  flat 

heterostructures (often referred to as “van der Waals”) with clear interface and physical 

contact.  

 Tuning the growth mode from its initial states can be achieved by plasma assisted 

chemical  vapor  deposition  as  a  versatile  technique  to  control  the  growth  direction  of 

graphene. Thus, horizontal coatings [26, 27] or vertical nanowalls, and nanorods [28] on 

different  insulators  and  semiconductors  have  been  grown.  Moreover,  the  plasma 

assisted deposition enhances the degree of activation of the precursor molecules and the 

substrate  surface  at  lower  temperature  than  thermal  synthesis,  which  positively 

influences the resulting interfacial bonding. 

We  here  report,  for  the  first  time,  on  a  new  plasma-based  approach  for  the  direct 

synthesis  of  graphitic  carbon  structures,  namely  atomically  thin  films,  nanodots  and 

nanorods, on rutile TiO2 (110) single-crystal surface. We have chosen this face due to 

the  high  stability  of  this  surface  [29]  and  because  it  is  the  most  common  interfacial 

termination in nanostructured TiO2 (e.g. nanoparticles) providing us a model system to 

investigate the carbon-TiO2 hybrid. The influence of the deposition atmosphere on the 

structure, the junction and the growth direction of the graphitic material is assessed. The 

chemical analysis of the interface indicates that covalent bonds are established between 

both  materials.  Subsequent  photocurrent  measurements  under  light  illumination  reveal 

that the charge transfer across the interface is efficient. The methodologies shown here-

after  led  to  the  fabrication  of  clean  carbon-semiconductor  interfaces  and  can  be 

extended  to  a  variety  of  practical  semiconducting  structures  as  thin  films,  barrier 

layers[30], pillars or nanoparticles [23, 31]. 

2.  Experimental 

Carbon  materials  synthesis:  Electron  Cyclotron  Resonance  chemical  vapor 

deposition  (ECR-CVD)  plasma-assisted  technique  is  used  for  the  deposition  of 

graphenic materials. The employed ASTEX AX 4500 system consists of a microwave 

power source, a two zone chamber and a two stage pumping system [32]. The reaction 

chamber  is  polarized.  The  bias  electrodes  attract  electrons  and  ions  from  the  plasma 

generated in the plasma chamber as, in this way, only neutral species reach the sample 

3	

	
 
surface  and  the  formation  of  defects  is  greatly  minimized.  Rutile  TiO2  (110),  rutile 
single crystals (Crystal GmbH, ref. TIO 205E, 5x5x0.5 mm3, single side polished) are 

used  as  substrates  and  C2H2  as  carbon  precursor  diluted  in  Ar  or  O2.  The  surface 

roughness  of  these  crystals  measured  by  AFM  is  rms=0.6  Å  (fig.  S2).The  growth 

process is separated into two steps, with different temperature to control the nucleation 

(675ºC) and growth stages (735ºC) [26, 33, 34]. In the first step, high quality graphitic 

seeds nucleate. In the second step, the growth is promoted from the nucleated dots up to 

the  graphenic  structure  or  layer  formation.  The  plasma  power  (200  W)  and  precursor 

(C2H2) pressure and flow are kept constant throughout the study (see text).

measurements are performed with a commercial instrument and software from Nanotec 

[35]. Two different operation modes are employed: dynamic mode, exciting the tip at its 

resonance frequency (∼75 kHz) to acquire topographic information of the samples and 

contact  mode  to  sweep  away  the  carbon  deposits  and  measure  the  thickness.  Charge 

transfer through carbon-TiO2 interface under light illumination is assessed by measuring 

current  vs  bias  voltage  characteristics  with  a  Keithley  2450  source-meter.  The 

photocurrent  measurements  are  performed  by  the  direct  microprobing  method  using 

carbon  fiber  tips  to  avoid  the  scratching  of  the  surface  and  minimize  the  contact 

potentials  with  graphene.  The  probes  are  made  out  polyacrylonitrile  (PAN)  carbon 

fibers  ~1mm  long  and  7  µm  diameter  [36].  We  illuminate  the  sample  in  the  UV-Vis 
range using a Bentham TLS120Xe tunable light source with 8 mW/cm2 constant power 

density.  To  modulate  the  light  power  we  use  a  variable  attenuator  in  between  two 

optical fibers (one connected to the lamp and the other connected to the set-up) in order 

to adjust the power of the light at the end of the last optical fiber. The photocurrent is 

extracted  from  the  measured  current  under  illumination  by  subtracting  the  current 

values  in  dark  conditions.  The  structure  of  our  composites  is  addressed  by  Raman 

spectroscopy using a confocal Raman microscope (Witec alpha-300R). Raman spectra 

have  been  obtained  using  a  532  nm  excitation  laser  and  a  100x  objective  lens  (NA  = 

0.9).  The  incident  laser  power  is  1  mW.  The  nature  of  the  chemical  bonds  between 

carbon  and  TiO2  is  determined  with  X-ray  Photoelectron  Spectroscopy  (XPS).  XPS 

measurements  are  carried  out  under  ultra-high  vacuum  (UHV)  conditions  using  a 

PHOIBOS  100  1D  delay  line  detector  electron/ion  analyzer,  monochromatic  Al  Kα 

anode  (1486.6  eV),  and  a  pass  energy  of  15  eV.  The  binding  energy  (BE)  scale  is 

4	

	
calibrated with respect to the Ti 2p core level peak at 459.3 eV [37]. All peaks shown in 

this  work  are  fitted  using  Voigt  functions  after  subtraction  of  a  Shirley-type 

background.  In  all  cases,  the  Lorentzian  full-width  half-maximum  (FWHM-L)  is  kept 

constant during the fitting (0.25 and 0.35 eV for C 1s and O 1s, respectively) while the 

Gaussian one (FWHM-G) is allowed to change. The sheet resistance of the continuous 

films  is  characterized  by  four  point  probe  measurements  (JANDEL  RMS2  Universal 

Probe)  with  continuous  current  (from  1  to  100  μA).  Light  absorption  is  measured  by 

ultraviolet-visible  spectroscopy  (UV-Vis)  by  using  a  SHIMADZU  SolidSpec–3700 

Spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. 

3.  Results and discussion 

3.1 Growth and morphology of graphitic structures on TiO2 (110) 

We  have  used  various  gas  mixtures  of  O2/C2H2  and  Ar/C2H2  for  the  synthesis 

rendering  a  variety  of  graphenic  materials.  Figure  1(a)  compares  the  optimized 

deposition profiles in both cases, with only O2 during synthesis (see blue dashed line) 

and with only Ar during synthesis (see black dotted line) as diluents. In both protocols, 

the  initial  heating  step  is  carried  out  under  an  O2  atmosphere  to  preserve  the  oxide 

surface from possible thermal-induced O desorption during this stage. The final cooling 

step is also carried out under an Ar atmosphere to avoid carbon oxidation. Best results 

are achieved when 675ºC and 735ºC are used during the nucleation and growth steps, 

respectively. Processing time, plasma power, partial  pressures of O2,  Ar  and  C2H2 are 

kept constant during the synthesis (see the footnote under fig. 1 for further information 

of parameters). 

Figures  1(b1)  and  (b2)  show  the  AFM  topographic  images  of  the  carbon  structures 

grown with an O2/C2H2 atmosphere. It can be clearly observed in the AFM line profile 

of fig. 1(b3) that a columnar growth occurs, resulting in carbon dots/rods with apparent 

lateral size of around 50-70 nm and few nm (8-12 nm) in height. The nucleation density 
is low and well controlled with an average value of 5 nuclei/µm2. The carbon dots are 

homogeneously  distributed  on  the  TiO2  surface,  0.5  cm  in  lateral  size  (our  plasma 

deposition system has been previously checked to deposit materials homogeneously in 

samples  up  to  two  cm  in  diameter).  We  relate  this  growth  mode  to  the  preservation 

effect of O2 on the surface. As it can be noticed in Fig. 1(b1-b2), the surface remains flat, 

5	

	
 
 
similar  to  pristine  sample,  confirming  the  role  of  oxygen  neutralizing  the  thermal-

induced  O  desorption  from  the  TiO2  surface,  decreasing  its  degree  of  activation  and 

minimizing the nucleation points.

This  resulting  graphenic  structure  deposited  over  the  semiconductor  could  be 

suitable  for  photocatalytic  applications  as  it  resembles  the  desired  structure  of  metal 

cluster loaded semiconductor photocatalyst [38], even more taking into account that de 

nucleation density can be controlled, as we show below. Figures 1(c1) and (c2) show the 

AFM images of the deposit performed with an Ar/C2H2 atmosphere. It can be noticed 

that in this case the surface is fully covered with a continuous film (see fig. 1(c2)) with 

homogeneous  structure  and  average  grain  size  of  30-50  nm  (see  the  structure  in  fig. 
1(c1)) that corresponds to a nucleation density of 400 nuclei/µm2, approximately. 

Figure 1(c3) shows the roughness profile of the film. The film thickness is around 4 

nm (see Fig. S1). It is worth mentioning that it is possible to control the thickness of the 

film with the deposition time even at submonolayer regime. Figure S1 in SI shows that 

the  substrate  surface  does  not  suffer  any  etching  during  growth.  The  electrical 

continuity  of  this  film  has  been  tested  by  four  point  probe  measurements  with  an 
average  sheet  resistance  of  3  kΩ·sq-1  (corresponding  ρ=6.8·10-6  Ω·m).  This  high 

conductivity is related to the graphenic character of the film. Taking into account that 

the  probe  separation  is  3  mm  and  film  thickness  is  around  4  nm  the  continuity  of  the 

film accounts for the homogeneous distribution of the material.  

The  optimized  nucleation  density  of  both  growth  protocols  can  be  compared  by 

observing  the  AFM  images  in  figs.  1(b2)  and  1(c2).  We  can  speculate  that  the  low 

nucleation  density  in  the  first  case  is  due  to  the  critical  role  that  O2  gas  plays  in 

replacing the vast majority of the desorbed terminal O atoms which would promote the 

generation of vacancies on the surface due to the high temperature during growth [29]. 

The  balance  between  O  removal  and  O  replacement  affects  the  nucleation  rate  and 

strongly depends on the diluents used. In the case of Ar, balance is not achieved which 

results in a surface activation that promotes a noticeable amount of nucleation centers. 

The  activation  of 

the  surface 

is  related 

to 

its  slight  reduction  and  partial 

functionalization by H atoms generated by the plasma activation of C2H2. However, this 

effect is greatly minimized by the fast deposition rate.

methodology  with  Ar  diluent.  Temperature:  675ºC  (nucleation),  735ºC  (growth),  t0=40  min, 
t1=4 min, t2=12 min, t3=40 min. Ar flow= 30 sccm, C2H2 flow=15 sccm. Plasma power 200W.

sccm. Plasma power 200W. Vertical scale in both figures: 0-5 nm. 

In order to further demonstrate the benefits of using a two-step synthesis protocol, 

figure 2 presents a comparison between the sample grown with a two-step protocol with 

Ar/C2H2 and one sample grown with a single-step protocol without the nucleation step 

and similar growth conditions. Figure 2(a) shows the continuous film structure with an 

average grain size of 50 nm in diameter (see the amplified image on the right). Figure 

2(b) shows the structure of the deposit performed using a one-step growth procedure. In 

the latter case, it can be clearly observed that the average grain size is less than 20 nm, 

much smaller than in the two-step case. This smaller grain size has a direct impact in the 

final resistance of the film (tens of kΩ). It is also important to underline that the lateral 

increase of the grain observed with the two-step Ar/C2H2 protocol does not occur in the 

8	

	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
O2/C2H2 protocol. Figure 3 shows that in this case, only an increase in the height of the 

nuclei  and  in  the  nucleation  density  is  observed.  Both  the  nucleation  density  and  the 

nuclei height can be tuned by modifying the deposition parameters, but the diameter of 

the  grains  remains  nearly  constant.  This  is  the  main  feature  that  corroborates  that  the 

vertical growth of the nuclei is favored with respect to its horizontal growth.

3.2 Structural and surface analysis of the deposits and the interface with TiO2 (110) 

Figure  4(a)  shows  the  Raman  spectra  of  the  samples  deposited  in  two  steps  using 

Ar/C2H2  (in  black)  and  O2/C2H2  (in  blue)  atmospheres.  The  Raman  spectra  from  the 

TiO2 reference crystal (in purple) and sample deposited in one step with Ar/C2H2 (see 

fig  2(b))  are  also  included  (in  red)  for  comparison.  Both  spectra  obtained  from  the 

samples deposited with Ar present similar structure of the grown material (the intensity 

9	

	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is  lower  in  one-step  probably  related  to  smaller  thickness)  and  show  the  typical  D,  G 

and  2D  carbon  peaks,  confirming  that  the  deposits  are  crystalline  and  graphenic  in 

nature [39, 40].   

Figure 4. (a) Confocal Raman spectra of samples deposited in two steps with O2 diluent (blue 
line),  Ar  diluent  (black  line)  and  TiO2  reference  crystal  (purple).  The  spectrum  from  the  one-

O2 in two steps showing the main contributions.

The low intensity of the 2D peak, the low I2D/IG ratio and the high value of the ID/IG 

ratio  (≈1)  indicate  a  small  grain  size  and  a  high  density  of  grain  boundaries,  in  good 

agreement with Fig. 2. Along with the grain boundaries, another contribution to the high 

D peak intensity could be some remaining internal defects within the grains as well as 

some  functionalization  with  plasma  species  (i.e.  certain  amount  of  hydrogen  from  the 
C2H2 plasma, inducing some sp3 hybridization in the corresponding carbon atoms) [41]. 

In order to assess more in depth the crystallinity of the continuous film deposited with 

Ar  we  subjected  the  sample  to  X-Ray  diffraction  (XRD)  measurements  (Fig.  S3).  In 

principle, the XRD analysis suggests that our sample lacks long range graphitic order. 

However,  the  analysis  confirms  that  it  is  composed  by  turbostratic  graphenic  carbon 

nanoflakes. The spectrum in blue in Figure 4(a), corresponding to the sample deposited 

with  O2  in  two  steps,  shows  a  D  carbon  related  peak  with  low  intensity,  that  can  be 
ascribed to the small amount of deposit (5 nuclei/µm2) as observed in fig. 1(b) together 
with a high contribution of the substrate. The carbon G peak (1600 cm-1) overlaps with 
a substrate band (purple line), which is located at a similar shift around 1630 cm-1, and 

2D peak does not appear in the spectrum. However, the small D peak observed confirms 

the  carbon  deposition.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  appearance  of  a  clear  and  relatively 
narrow  D  peak  (FWHM≈45  cm-1)  is  related  to  the  tiny  size  of  the  dots  observed  and 

verifies that the deposit is not amorphous but of crystalline nature [39].  

In order to further elucidate the chemical structure and the quality of the interface 

between the deposits and the TiO2 (110), we perform a surface analysis of the samples 

with XPS. Figure 4(b) shows the characteristic XPS C 1s core level spectra obtained for 

both samples, i.e., the one grown with O2 diluent (blue curve) and the sample deposited 

with  Ar  diluent  (black  curve).  Comparison  between  both  spectra  gives  important 

insights  into  the  chemical  composition  of  both  systems.  First,  we  notice  the  lower 

intensity  of  the  carbon  signal  of  the  sample  grown  with  O2  compared  to  the  sample 

grown  using  Ar  as  diluent;  this  is  a  further  corroboration  of  the  lower  amount  of 

graphenic  material  obtained  using  the  former  approach.  Second,  the  spectrum  of  the 

sample  grown  with  O2,  shows  a  wider  peak  which  is  shifted  toward  higher  binding 

energy (BE) with respect to the sample grown with Ar.

core  level  peak  of  the  two-steps  O2/C2H2  sample.  The  peak  can  be  decomposed  into  three 
different  components.  Black  dots:  raw  data;  red  curve:  fit;  blue,  green,  and  orange  curves: 
components. (d) Ti2p core level peak of the two-steps O2/C2H2 sample. The peak can be fitted 
with a single doublet component. Black dots: raw data; red curve: fit; blue curve: component. 

In order to better understand the origin of the difference in shape and position of the 

two  peaks,  we  have  deconvoluted  them  into  their  components  (see  Fig.  5  (a-b)).  The 

C1s core level associated to the Ar sample is composed of three peaks located at 284.7, 
285.8,  and  290.2  eV.  The  first  one  is  characteristic  of  a  sp2  configuration,  thus 

12	

	
 
 
 
 
compatible with the presence of graphitic C species [42]. The second peak is associated 

with  C-OH  species,  which  could  be  due  to  functionalization  of  grain  boundaries. 

Finally, the third component, presenting a very low area and appearing at 290.2 eV, is 

assigned to C=O or O-C=O associated to other adsorbed organic species. On the other 

hand, the deconvolution of the C1s core level peak of the sample prepared under an O2-

rich environment in figure 5(b) yields important differences (see also the XPS analysis 

of the O2 reference sample experiencing similar process without C2H2 and only with O2, 

in Fig S4). First of all, it is composed of five components instead of three, with a small 
component at 285.0 eV corresponding to graphitic sp2 carbon (this contribution is from 

adventitious carbon in Fig. S4 (a)). This result implies that there is a lower amount of 
purely sp2 graphitic structures as one would expect. Instead, we observe the presence of 

a component at 285.9 eV, similar to that found in the other sample, and associated to C-

OH, and another component 287.2 eV, associated with C-O, (i.e. Ti-O-C bonds). These 

two  are  the  majority  species  (the  C-O  bond  at  287.2  eV  is  undetectable  in  reference 

sample).  Then,  there  are  two  other  minority  species  appearing  at  289.3  and  293.5  eV, 

that we assign to C=O or O-C=O species, and second order events (i.e. plasmon losses 

or shake-up features), respectively. Thus, considering all the components present in the 

O2-rich  sample,  we  can  unambiguously  state  that  a  great  amount  of  C  atoms  on  the 

surface are covalently bound to O, thus confirming the formation of oxidized graphene 

or highly reduced graphene oxide [43-45]. In order to further corroborate the presence 

of  Ti-O-C  bonds  in  the  interface,  we  analyse  O1s  and  Ti  2p  peaks  from  the  sample 

grown with O2 as diluent (see fig. 4(c-d)) and deconvolute them into their components 

(see  fig.  5(c-d)  and  fig.  S4  (b-c)).  Figures  4(c)  and  5(c)  show  that  three  main 

components can be identified in O1s peak, one at 530.4 eV corresponding to oxygen in 

TiO2, and another at 531.2 eV, assigned to C-O, C-OH and Ti-O-C bonds [42, 43, 46]. 

Finally,  a  third  contribution  found  at  around  533.1  eV  which  is  usually  attributed  to 

C=O, O-C=O species [42, 47]. However, it can be clearly observed that in this case this 

component  is  quite  strong.  We  analyzed  in  depth  the  survey  and  detailed  spectra 

acquired  from  this  sample  and  from  the  O2  reference  sample  experiencing  similar 

process  without  C2H2  (see  fig.  S4  (b)  and  fig.  S5)  and  we  confirmed  that  there  also 

exists a contribution from impurities to this peak (i.e. SiOx residuals from TiO2 (110) 

surface  polishing  procedure).  Figure  4(d)  shows  the  XPS  Ti2p  spectrum  for  the  O2 

sample. This spectrum is formed by a single component located at 459.3 eV, in perfect 

agreement  with  the  expected  position  for  titanium  in  TiO2  substrates  [48].  Other 

13	

	
contributions  due  to  titanium  carbide  formation  (Ti-C  bond  at  455  eV)  or  substrate 
reduction (Ti3+ at 458 eV) are not detected (see fig. 5(d)). With these results, we propose 

that the signals observed in the C 1s spectrum at 287.2 eV and O 1s spectrum at 531.2 

eV are contributed by Ti-O-C bonds to a large extent. However, as the O1s component 

at  531.3  eV  is  present  in  the  O2  reference  sample  in  Fig.  S4  (b),  the  results  are  not 

conclusive  (it  should  be  noted  that,  even  though  this  component  is  present  in  both 

samples, we perceive that its ratio with the component from oxygen in TiO2 is higher). 

Moreover,  Ti-O-C  component  is  missing  in  the  spectra  acquired  from  the  sample 

deposited with Ar in two-step. In this case, the signal comes mostly from the continuous 

graphenic layer (few nm thick) being the signal from the interface weak.  

To  ascertain  the  composition  of  the  interface  of  the  deposits  made  with  Ar,  we 

analyse the structure and interface on the sample deposited in one-step as this sample is 

thinner than the sample grown in two steps and the interfacial contribution to the spectra 

is expected to be much higher. We also performed the XPS analysis of an Ar reference 

sample experiencing similar process without C2H2 and only with Ar. We show in Figure 

6,  the  characteristic  XPS  C  1s,  O  1s  and  Ti  2p  core  level  spectra  obtained  from  both 

samples.  

Overall,  the  C1s  and  O1s  core  level  spectra  in  fig.  6  (a-d)  safely  confirm  the 

formation of chemical Ti-O-C bonds between C and O (TiC bond is not detected).  The 

C1s component at 287.2 eV (pink) in Fig. 6(a), that correspond to Ti-O-C bonds, does 

not appear in the  C1s core level peak of the Ar reference sample in Fig. 6(b). Neither it 

appears in Fig. 5 (a) related to the C1s core level associated to the Ar sample deposited 

in  two-steps.  Also,  the  O1s  at  531.7  eV  (green),  assigned  to  C-O,  C-OH  and  Ti-O-C 

bonds is very low in the Ar reference sample in comparison with the deposited sample. 

This bonding in an oxygen-free atmosphere, where the only source of O is the sample 

itself,  undoubtedly  confirms  a  direct  contact  between  the  graphitic  film  and  the  TiO2 

surface, a crucial characteristic in efficient charge transfer and extraction processes [49]. 

The  formation  of  this  chemical  bond  has  been  previously  proposed  in  graphene-TiO2 

composites [23, 24, 46, 50, 51] without such clear evidence.

3.3 Optical absorption of carbon-TiO2 (110) structures 

Figure  7  shows  the  UV-visible  diffuse  reflectance  spectra  of  carbon-TiO2  samples 

deposited in two steps with Ar/C2H2 (in black) and O2/C2H2 (in blue) and their related 

photographs. For pristine TiO2, both, the reference spectrum (in red) and the photograph 

are  also  included  for  comparison.  There  is  no detectable  difference  in  the  reflectance-

absorbance between the reference spectrum and the sample deposited with O2/C2H2. We 

relate this result to the lack of oxygen vacancies or reduction [52] and the low density (5 
nuclei/µm2) and size of the nuclei (lateral size around 50 nm and 8-12 nm in height) for 

16	

	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this  sample.  However,  a  remarkable  absorption  in  the  visible  range  for  the  sample 

grown  with  Ar/C2H2  can  be  seen.  A  grey  contrast  in  the  photography  and  diminished 

reflectance  in  the  spectrum  in  Fig.  7  is  clearly  observed.  This  grey  contrast  is  mainly 

related  to  graphitic  carbon  light  absorption  which  depends  on  the  thickness  of  the 

deposited  film  (few  nm  in  this  case)  [53].  However,  other  causes  of  visible  light 

absorption  might  be  present,  as  generation  of  oxygen  vacancies  by  reduction  of  the 

substrate  that  modifies  the  electronic  band  gap  [54].  In  the  case  of  the  Ar/C2H2,  the 

C2H2  molecule  under  plasma  activation  can  generate  certain  amount  of  H  promoting 

superficial  or  even  bulk  reduction  of  the  substrate  in  combination  with  the  process 
temperature  [55].  Also  Ar+  from  the  plasma  can  promote  surface  sputtering  and 

preferential  desorption  of  O  [56].  These  well-known  effects  [52,  57]  can  be  ruled  out 

with further characterization of the electrical response of the system under illumination, 

as we show below.

step  protocol  with  Ar/C2H2  (in  black),  O2/C2H2  (in  blue)  and  their  related  photographs.  The 
reference pristine TiO2 substrate (in red) is also included. The absorbance values are qualitative 
and have a comparative purpose. 

17	

	
 
 
 
 
 
There  results  show  that  the  incorporation  of  graphitic  carbon  to  TiO2  promotes  an 

extended  light  absorption  range  which  should  eventually  improve  the  overall 

performance of the material in potential applications in photocatalysis or photovoltaics 

[8, 18-20]. 

3.4 Photocurrent generation through carbon-TiO2 (110) interface  

In  order  to  test  the  electrical  response  to  the  light  of  the  carbon-TiO2  structure, 

several current vs.  bias voltage measurements of the continuous sample deposited with 

Ar/C2H2 mixture in two steps have been performed. Figure 8(a) presents the set-up used 

to  acquire  the  measurements  [36].  With  this  configuration,  we  make  contact  onto  the 

graphitic film with two carbon probes applying a voltage difference between them and 

obtaining the in-plane generated current both in dark conditions and after illumination. 

Figure 8(b) shows the current vs.  bias voltage output characteristics of the carbon-TiO2 

sample in dark conditions (black line) and at different wavelengths in the UV-Vis range. 

Due to the high conductivity of the graphitic film, the current in dark conditions is in the 

order of tens of µA. The response of the sample to the visible light is negligible, as can 

be  seen  in  the  output  (420  nm-blue  line)  included  as  an  example  in  figure  8(b),  with 

similar  results  at  longer  wavelengths.  However,  the  response  to  the  UV  light  is 

significant (300 nm-purple line). This further confirms that the chemical interaction at 

the  interface  is  fairly  good  and  the  charge  transfer  is  effective.  Moreover,  once  the 

chemical  contact  is  confirmed,  the  lack  of  excitation  under  visible  light  illumination 

means that the band gap of the material has not been notably modified. As the substrate 

reduction  would  decrease  in  a  remarkable  way  the  band  gap  of  the  material  [54],  this 

effect and its contribution to the visible light absorption can be ruled out. Accordingly, 

visible light absorption of the sample deposited with Ar/C2H2 in figure 7 can be mainly 

attributed to the graphitic layer itself.  

Figure  8(c)  depicts  the  response  to  the  UV  light  at  different  wavelengths.  The 

photocurrent  is  extracted  from  the  total  current  under  illumination  conditions  by 

subtracting the values in dark conditions. The response to the UV light is dependent on 

the wavelength and increases with the light energy at shorter wavelengths. This effect is 

related  to  the  intrinsic  light  absorption  of  the  TiO2  in  this  range  [6].  The  detected 

photocurrent  is  in  the  order  of  µA,  one  order  of  magnitude  higher  than  already 

published  values  of  photocurrent  generation,  i.e.  in  photocatalytic  TiO2  nanoparticles 

doped with C [49], or wrapped with graphene [15]. Moreover, the lack of excitation to 

18	

	
visible light postulates this type of carbon-TiO2 junction as promising candidate in high 

performance UV selective photodetectors [58].

4.  Conclusions 

The  present  study  demonstrates  an  efficient  methodology  for  the  growth  of 

graphenic  structures  on  TiO2.  The  structure,  composition  and  growth  dynamics  of  the 

deposited  materials  on  the  TiO2  (110)  interface  can  be  tailored  by  modifying  the 

synthesis  atmosphere.  On  one  hand,  the  synthesis  with  O2/C2H2  results  in  graphene 

oxide  nanodots/rods  with  controllable  height  and  density.  On  the  other  hand  the 

synthesis  performed  with  Ar/C2H2  gases  promotes  the  direct  growth  of  continuous 

graphenic  films.  The  measured  grain  size  (~50  nm)  and  few  layer  thickness  of  the 
graphenic network induce a markedly low resistivity (ρ=6.8·10-6 Ω·m) in the films. The 

chemical  state  established  between  carbon  and  TiO2  is  carefully  investigated  by  XPS 

and the formation of Ti-O-C chemical bonds is proposed. High photocurrent measured 

through  carbon-TiO2  interface  demonstrates  an  efficient  charge  transfer  that  further 

confirms an intimate contact between both materials.  

In conclusion, the synthesis methods carried out in this work led to the fabrication of 

structurally  tailored  and  clean  graphenic  semiconductor  interfaces.  The  reported 

processes are intrinsically pure, scalable and can be applied onto other semiconducting 

structures as nanoparticles [31].
