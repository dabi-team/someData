Introduction

The Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver of an Artin algebra is a quiver whose vertices correspond to
indecomposable modules of the algebra and whose arrows correspond to irreducible morphisms
between the modules. In particular, for a Dynkin quiver Q of ﬁnite type X = ADE and the
corresponding path algebra CQ, Gabriel [10] showed that the corresponding AR quiver ΓQ
consists of the set of vertices identiﬁed with the set Φ+ of positive roots.

On the other hand, for a given Dynkin quiver Q, there are the corresponding Coxeter element
of reduced expressions of the longest element

w0 in the Weyl group W . Interestingly, the AR-quiver ΓQ is closely related to φQ, ≺Q and
as follows (see Section 2.1 and 2.2 for details).

]

]

ΓQ is completely determined by the Coxeter element φQ or the Dynkin quiver Q.
ΓQ can be understood as the Hesse diagram of ≺Q deﬁned on Φ+. In other words,

for α, β ∈ Φ+, α ≺Q β

⇐⇒

there exists a path from β to α in ΓQ.

A reduced expression

w0 of w0 which is adapted to Q can be obtained by reading the AR-

quiver ΓQ properly. The set of reduced expressions adapted to Q forms the commutation class

Moreover, in [24, 25, 26], the ﬁrst named author investigated that certain statistics of AR-
quivers provide some signiﬁcant information in the representation theories of quantum groups
Uq
and KLR-algebras. Especially, he read the denomina-
tor formulas and Dorey’s rule by constructing a simple algorithm for labeling ΓQ which depends
only on its shape. More precisely, he showed the followings

1. Reduced expressions and combinatorial AR-quivers

In this section, we review notions related to reduced expressions of the longest element in a
Weyl group and introduce an r-cluster point, which consists of commutation classes of reduced
expressions. Also, we recall the combinatorial AR-quiver associated to a class of reduced ex-
pressions, which is a generalization of the AR-quiver (Section 2) associated to a class of adapted
reduced expressions.

In this paper, we deal with two types of r-cluster points: adapted r-cluster points (Deﬁnition
2.2) and twisted adapted r-cluster points (Section 3). An adapted r-cluster point consists of
adapted reduced expressions. This type of r-cluster points are well-investigated. On the other
hand, twisted adapted r-cluster points are newly investigated in this paper for the best of
authors’ knowledge.

i 0 of w0, we can deﬁne a total order <i 0 on Φ+ as follows:

βi 0
k ∶

Interestingly, the order <i 0 is convex in the following sense (see [31, 35]): We say that an order
≺ on Φ+ is convex if it satisﬁes the following property: For α, β ∈ Φ+ satisfying α + β ∈ Φ+, we
have either

2.1. Coxeter elements and the adapted r-cluster point

quiver Q, which is obtained by orienting all edges of the Dynkin diagram ∆. For a sink i of Q,
we denote by iQ the quiver obtained from Q by reversing the orientation of each arrow incidents
with i in Q. For a reduced word i , we say that i = i1i2⋯il is adapted to Q if

Also, recall that a Coxeter element φ = si1si2⋯sin is a product of simple reﬂections, where

The following theorem shows that Dynkin quivers and Coxeter elements are closely related

to classes of reduced expressions.

3.1. Twisted Coxeter elements. As we showed in Section 2, a Coxeter element has informa-
tion about the corresponding adapted commutation class. In a similar sense, a twisted Coxeter
element introduced in this subsection gives rise to a commutation class, which will be called
a twisted adapted class. Note that a twisted Coxeter element is closely related to a twisted
Dynkin quiver deﬁned in Appendix B via the correspondence (B.3).

Remark 3.1. We can view the Weyl group W as a subgroup of GL
generated by the set
of simple reﬂections
. In this case, we use the term “reduced expression” instead of
}
“reduced word”. Moreover, we sometimes abuse the notation i to represent reduced expressions.

● A reduced expression associated to a twisted Coxeter element, type A2n+1 case:

Proposition 3.7. The word i♮0 in (3.4) is a reduced expression of w0 of type A2n+1 which is not
adapted to any Dynkin quiver. Hence it can be denoted by i♮0 instead of i♮

Proof. Let us recall that the Weyl group of type A2n+1 is the symmetric group S2n+2 and w0
satisﬁes w0

Denote t = s1s2⋯snsn+1s2n+1s2n⋯sn+1 and t− = s1s2⋯snsn+1. Then one can check that

Remark 4.12. Note that there are only 4 × 3n−1-many twisted Coxeter elements of type A2n+1
while there are 22n-many twisted adapted classes. Thus there are twisted adapted classes which
are not associated to any twisted Coxeter element in the sense of Theorem 4.11.

Now, using the properties above, we shall derive an algorithm (Algorithm 4.15) to get the
combinatorial AR-quiver associated to a twisted adapted class. Recall that, by Lemma 4.8, we

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows from Proposition 4.19 and 4.20. Also, since distinct twisted
Coxeter elements of type Dn+1 give rise to reduced expressions with distinct combinatorial AR-
of type Dn+1 is the same as the number of twisted Coxeter

Remark 4.22. Analogous to the case of adapted commutation classes, there is the natural one-
to-one correspondence between the set of twisted Coxeter elements and twisted commutation
classes of type Dn+1. It follows by the fact that the number of elements in both sets is 2n.

By Proposition 4.20 and Proposition 4.19, we can consider pDn+1

between twisted adapted classes of type Dn+1 and adapted classes of type An, i.e.,

Remark 4.25. As quivers, two AR-quivers ΓQ∗ and ΓQ are isomorphic to each other. More
explicitly, ΓQ∗ ≃ ΓQ by the map which relates a vertex in ΓQ∗ with residue i to a vertex in ΓQ
with residue i∗ = n + 1 − i. This fact will be used crucially in Section 6.2.

We can derive an algorithm of ﬁnding twisted adapted AR-quiver of type Dn+1 by Remark

(3) Change residues of vertices from n to n + 1 if they correspond to n + 1 in i 0.

(1) Let i 0 be of type A2n+1 and ∨ be the one in (3.1a). By the surgery in Algorithm 4.15, if

j = 2n + 2 − i, the parity of p and q are diﬀerent and hence our assertion follows.

(2) For i 0 of type Dn+1 and ∨ in (3.1b), our assertion is obvious from the surgery in Algorithm

4.26.

The remained exceptional cases can be checked directly.

We call the

Recall the notions induced and non-induced vertices in Remark 4.17. Note that a sectional path

Proposition 6.2. Let k ≥ n.

(1) Every vertex in an N -path with k-arrows has 2n + 1 − k as the ﬁrst component.
(2) Every vertex in an S-path with k-arrows has k + 1 as the second component.

Proof. Note that we have a maximal N -path with 2n-arrows. By Proposition 2.10, its ﬁrst

By Lemma 6.5 and Proposition 6.2, we have the following theorem:

[

(1) every induced N -path with k-arrows shares 2n + 1 − k as the ﬁrst component,
(2) every induced S-path with k-arrows shares k + 1 as the second component.

Hence, for every vertex in Υ

Now, if α, β, γ, δ consists of size m × n rectangular, then by applying the same argument m ⋅ n

Proposition 6.18. Labeling for vertices in ΥC
precisely, if γ ∈ ΥC

is the intersection of

an N -path crossing α =

and an S-path crossing β =

then γ =

Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that α and β are in S and N . Since α, β, γ

satisfy assumptions in Lemma 6.17 (2), we have γ = α + β.

Theorem 6.19. We can label Υ

by only observing its shape.

[i0]

Proof. (1) By Proposition 6.14, Proposition 6.15, we can label the vertices lying in (i) all sectional
-arrows, (ii) N and (iii) S by using Theorem 2.11. Since every vertices

Proposition 6.18 depend only on the shape of Υ

For the rest of this subsection, we shall list up the combinatorial properties of the labeling of

Υ[i 0] followed by Theorem 6.19:

Proposition 6.20. A folded AR-quiver

[i0]

satisﬁes the following properties:

(1) Every vertex in a sectional path shares a component.
(2) Consider the N -path and the S-path which have the vertices with folded coordinates

ˆ1, p
)
(
ˆ1, p + 1
, respectively. If every vertex in the N -path shares the component i then
)
(

and
every vertex in the S-path shares the component −i.

(3) Consider the N -path and the S-path which have the vertices with folded coordinates

ˆn, q

(
ˆn, q − 1

)
(

and
every vertex in the S-path also shares the component i.

Remark 6.21. Inspired from Proposition 6.20 (3), we will deﬁne a swing in Deﬁnition 8.16
below, which plays an important role in later sections.

By Proposition 6.20, we get the following corollary.

In [26], the ﬁrst named author described denominator formulas for untwisted aﬃne type

of ﬁnite type ADE and relations between distance polynomials and denominator formulas.

Then we introduce how to generalized the results to the cases of untwisted aﬃne type BCFG

Proposition B.9. There is a natural one-to-one correspondence between (triply) twisted Dynkin
quivers and (triply) twisted Coxeter elements deﬁned as follows:

where φQ∨ is an element in W all of whose reduced expressions are adapted to Q∨.
Proof. By deﬁnitions, there exists only one φQ∨

Hence (B.3) is a one-to-one correspondence. The assertion for triply twisted case can be proved
(cid:3)
directly.

Recall (4.6), (4.8) and (4.10) (resp. (4.11)), a (triply) twisted Coxeter element φQ∨

∨ induces
a reduced expression of w0. Let us denote the class associated to the (triply) twisted Coxeter
element φQ∨

Considering Remark B.3, the following theorem tells that a reduced expression adapted to
Q∨ can be understood as a reduced expression which is related to a Dynkin diagram of type Bn,

Proposition B.10. If i0 is adapted to Q∨ then i0 ∈

im+1 (resp. im) is a sink in rimrim−1⋯ri2ri1Q ∨ (resp. rim+1 rim−1 ⋯ri2ri1Q∨)
