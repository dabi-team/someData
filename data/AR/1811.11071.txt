Abstract

Designing an eﬃcient membrane for He puriﬁcation is quite crucial in scientiﬁc

and industrial applications. Ultrathin membranes with intrinsic pores are highly

desirable for gas puriﬁcation because of their controllable aperture and homo-

geneous hole distribution. Based on the ﬁrst−principles density function theory

and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the compressively

strained graphitic carbon nitride (CN) can eﬀectively purify He from Ne and

Ar. Under a −6% strain, the CN monolayer with a suitable pore size presents

an easily surmountable barrier for He (0.11 eV) but formidable for Ne (0.51 eV)

and Ar (2.45 eV) passing through the membrane, and it exhibits exceptionally

high selectivity of 5.17 × 106 for He/Ne and 1.89 × 1039 for He/Ar, as well as ex-

cellent He permeance of 1.94 × 107 GPU at room temperature, superior to those

of porous graphene and C2N membrane. Our results conﬁrm that strain−tuned

CN membrane could be potentially utilized for He separating from other noble

gases.

1. Introduction

With various properties, such as lower density than air, incombustibility and

low index of refraction, the lightest noble gas, helium, has been extensively ap-

plied in the ﬁelds of semiconductors, airships and solar telescopes.[1, 2] However,

He immediately drifts up during the extraction from the natural gas, resulting in

its irreversibly losing on earth. And the traditional physical methods of produc-

ing He, like cryogenic distillation or pressure−swing adsorption of natural gas, is

hard to obtain high enough concentration to meet the commercial utilization of

He.[3] Due to the low cost and easy operation, membrane separation technology

has been increasingly used in gas separation and sewage puriﬁcation.[4] The gas

permeability are quite sensitive to the thickness of membrane materials.[5, 6, 7]

Therefore, the ideal membrane should be as thin as possible to receive maximum

ﬂux, mechanically robust to prevent cracking, and with well−deﬁned pore sizes

to increase selectivity. It is highly desirable to design the eﬃcient He separation

membrane having atomic thickness and sub−nanometer pores.

The single atomic thickness makes two−dimensional (2D) materials ideal for

gas separation compared to conventional membranes.[8, 9] For gas puriﬁcation,

the hole size of the material plays a dominated role in determining the selectivity

and permeability. Although the introduction of vacancy defects on the pristine

graphene, silicene and germanene ecane which are impermeable to gas molecules,

could provide a suitable pore size for gas separation.[10, 11, 12] However, it re-

mains diﬃculties in controlling the size and number of pores experimentally.[13]

Excitingly, some 2D porous ﬁlms with uniform sub−nanopores, such as graphitic

carbon nitride (C3N4,[14] C2N[8]) and stanene,[7] can act as natural molecular

sieves and have great potential for future He puriﬁcation. To meet the in-

creasing demand of He, researchers are focusing on designing more eﬃcient and

accurate molecular sieves. Based on the characteristics that porous membranes

are sensitive to mechanical strain, the multi−stage gas separation approach by

strain−modulating pore size has attracted great interest.[15, 16, 17]

As one of the graphitic carbon nitride family, the experimentally prepared

2

porous CN has fascinated considerable attention owing to its potential applica-

tions in energy storage and catalysts.[18, 19, 20] CN possesses honeycomb−like

structure similar to graphene but with six−membered carbon−nitride ring in

units [see Fig. 1 (a)], which makes it a candidate for gas separation. As re-

ported, the stability of CN was conﬁrmed by calculating the phonon dispersion

spectrum, and CN membrane could separate H2 from mixed composition in-

cluding CO, N2 and CH4.[21] To the best of our knowledge, research on the

utilization of CN for eﬃcient He puriﬁcation is still lacking.

In this work, we propose that the CN sheet, under a biaxial compressive−strain

of 6%, is a good candidate for He separation. The microscopic permeation pro-

cesses of He, Ne and Ar are discussed in terms of minimum energy passway,

energy proﬁle, and electron density isosurface. In addition, the diﬀusion and

separation capacity are judged from permeance and selectivity at room temper-

ature.

2. Computational details

The ﬁrst−principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations are per-

formed to optimize the structure of the porous CN, describe the electron density

isosurfaces for noble gas molecules interacting with the porous CN monolayer,

and carry out the energy barrier of noble gases permeating through CN mem-

brane by using the VASP package.[22] The perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE)

functional[23] under the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with van

der Waals correction proposed by Grimme (DFT−D2)[24] is employed by the

spin−unrestricted all−electron DFT calculations. The electron wave−functions

are expanded by plane waves with cut−oﬀ energies of 500 eV, and the conver-

gence criteria for electronic and ionic interactions during structure relaxation

are set to be 10−4 eV and 0.01 eV, respectively. The Monkhorst−Pack meshes

of 7 × 7 × 1 are used in sampling the Brillouin zone for 2 × 2 supercells of CN,

and a 20 ˚A vacuum thickness is introduced to avoid interlayer interactions. For

the transition state calculations, we have performed minimum energy path pro-

3

ﬁling using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI−NEB) method[25] as

implemented in the VASP transition state tools.

At the various temperatures, the He permeance of porous CN monolayer

are investigated using MD simulations in the NVT ensemble, where the tem-

perature of the system is controlled by the Andersen thermostat method. A

condensed−phase optimized molecular potential for atomistic simulation stud-

ies (COMPASS) in the Material Studio software is used for describing the in-

teratomic interaction.[26]

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Pore size and stability of CN nano−sheet

Figure 1(a) presents a top view of a fully relaxed 2 × 2 CN supercell. The

C−C and C−N bond lengths are 1.51 and 1.34 ˚A, respectively, and the optimized

lattice parameter is 7.12 ˚A, consistent with previous literature.[20] The hole

size, with a diameter of 5.47 ˚A, are illustrated by the dashed interior circle.

The electron density isosurface plot, shown in Fig. 1(b), indicates that the pore

size of CN monolayer is characterized by the eﬀective diameter of the inscribed

circle, 3.28 ˚A, which is much larger than the kinetic diameters of He (2.6 ˚A)

and a little bit larger than that of Ne molecules (3.2 ˚A).[27] Therefore, it oﬀers

the possibility to reduce the pore width in-between kinetic diameters of He and

Ne molecules and makes CN sheet as an eﬃcient He−isolating membrane. The

biaxial compressive strain is deﬁned as ε = (ι − ι0)/ι0 × 100% , where ι and

ι0 are the strained and original lengths of the monolayer along one of strain

direction (the sample is compressed in two distinct directions with the same

strain), respectively.

We investigate the He separation performance in the absence/presence of

compressive strain on CN monolayer. Under compressive strain, the structural

stability of CN is a key issue. As presented in Fig. 1(c), CN can sustain

a biaxial compressive strain up to −24%, which means that the structure of

the membrane is robust under a small compression. Then, we ﬁgure out the

4

cohesive energies of CN membrane under diﬀerent strains. The cohesive energy

is expressed by:[28]

Ecoh = (nCEC + nNEN − ECN)/(nC + nN)

(1)

Where EC, EN and ECN are the energy of single C atom, single N atom, total

CN membrane, respectively; and nC, nN are the total number of C and N

atoms. Fig. 1(c) shows that Ecoh decreases with the increasing strain, while

Ecoh under 6% compressive strain is 6.05 eV per atom, which is still much

lower than that of silicene (3.17 eV per atom).[29] And the strain energy of

the system (Es, the energy diﬀerence between strained and equilibrium states),

which actually equals to Es = −[Ecoh(εi) − Ecoh(ε0)] × (nC + nN), increases with

strain monotonically until the strain reaches the critical value of −24%. Note

that silicene can be successfully used as gas separation membrane,[30] therefore

CN under moderate mechanical strain is stable enough for He separation.

3.2. Diﬀusion energy barrier of the noble molecule

Before exploring the transition state and energy barrier, we ﬁrst optimize

the energetically most stable state (SS) of gas molecules on the surface of CN

monolayer. The atomic structures of He atom adsorbed on CN surface with and

without strain are presented in Fig. 2. The interaction energy between a noble

gas molecule and CN membrane is deﬁned by:

Eint = Egas/CN − Egas − ECN

(2)

Where Egas/CN, Egas and ECN represent the total enegy of gas/CN system,

isolated gas molecule and pure CN monolayer, respectively. The interaction

energy and adsorption height of the SS under diﬀerent compressive strains are

summarized in Table 1. The interaction energy and adsorption height are in the

range of −6.9 to −25.5 meV and 1.05 to 2.61 ˚A, respectively, indicating the gas

molecules are all physically adsorbed on the CN monolayer via weak van der

Waals interaction. The magnitude of adsorption energy is comparable to those

of the noble gases adsorbed on C3N4 (−17 to −99 meV) and C2N sheet (−60

5

to −90 meV). The general trend is that as the compressive strain increases, the

reduction in pore size would enhance the repulsion interaction between the gas

molecules and the CN membrane, leading to an increase in molecular adsorption

height. Speciﬁcally, Ar has the highest adsorption height, which is due to the

relatively large kinetic diameter.

When the gas migrates from the most stable adsorption site to the CN ﬁlm,

due to the symmetry, the transition state (TS) should be which the gas molecules

are at the center of the cavity and in the same plane as the ﬁlm. The TS state

is conﬁrmed using the NEB approach. The energy barrier (Eb) is deﬁned as:

Eb = ETS − ESS

(3)

Where ETS and ESS represents the energy between gas molecules and CN mem-

brane at the TS and SS, respectively. The energy proﬁles and barriers of He, Ne

and Ar passing through the pore under diﬀerent compressive strain are shown

in Fig. 3. The barrier for He, Ne and Ar passing through the pristine CN is

0.03, 0.18 and 1.13 eV, respectively. Clearly, the relatively low penetration bar-

rier for both He and Ne make it impracticable to purify He via unstrained CN

membrane. Fortunately, the energy barrier increases as the compressive strain

is exerted.

In particular, when the strain is reached to −6%, the barrier for

He, Ne and Ar is further increased to 0.11, 0.51 and 2.45 eV, respectively. The

unexpectedly lower penetration barrier for He is within the threshold barrier for

gas penetration (0.50 eV),[31] while the values for the other two noble gases are

lager than 0.50 eV, suggesting that the He separation performance of CN can

be signiﬁcantly improved by inducing a 6% compressive strain.

To deeply understand of the change of energy barrier when the molecules

pass strain−modiﬁed CN ﬁlm, we show the electron density isosurface of noble

gases interacting with CN at TS under −6% strain. Intuitively, large electron

density overlap would induce strong repulsion which hinder the movement of

gas molecules through the pore. From Fig. 4(a), it can be seen that there is no

overlap between the electron density of He and the CN, therefore He could easily

move through the membrane. However, the electron density overlap increases

6

for Ne and Ar, as presented in Fig. 4(b) and (c), the Ar molecule and the

porous CN sheet completely overlap in electron density, so the Ar gas molecules

cannot pass through the ﬁlm. The eﬀective diameter of strained CN [shown in

the inscribed circle of Fig. 4(a)] is now 2.99 ˚A, which is between the kinetic

diameter of He and Ne. Hence the compressed membrane only allows He to

penetrate.

The He separation eﬃciency of the porous CN membrane can be quantita-

tively examined through the Arrhenius−equation.[32] The selectivity (S) for He

over other two noble gas molecules is estimated by:

SHe/gas =

γHe
γgas

=

AHeexp(−EHe/RT )
Agasexp(−Egas/RT )

(4)

Where γ is the diﬀusion rate, the diﬀusion prefactor, A, is set to 1011 s−1,[27] R

and T are the Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature, respectively.

E is the diﬀusion energy barrier. The temperature−dependent diﬀusion rates of

noble gas molecules and He selectivity relative to Ne and Ar are depicted in Fig.

5(a) and (b), respectively. Generally, with the temperature increasing, the dif-

fusion rate of the molecules increases, while the He selectivity of CN membrane

relative to Ne and Ar decreases. The main reason is that, when the temperature

rises, the kinetic energy of the inert gas molecule is greatly increased, make it

possible to overcome the energy barriers and pass the CN ﬁlm. Signiﬁcantly,

at a certain temperature, the enhanced compressive strain reduces down the

He diﬀusion rate [Fig. 5(a)] but greatly increases the selectivity for He/Ne and

He/Ar [Fig. 5(b)], which demonstrates the appropriate compressive strain can

eﬀectively accelerate the separation of He from Ne and Ar. As summarized in

Table 2, at room temperature, the selectivity for He/Ne and He/Ar are about

5.17×106 and 1.89×1039 by subjecting to a −6% strain, respectively. The values

are much superior than that of other theoretical results and surely acceptable

for the industrial application.[8, 30, 33]

7

3.3. He separation by MD simulations

Permeability is another critical criterion to characterize the separation per-

formance of CN membrane. Based on MD simulations, we investigate the gas

ﬂow to estimate the permeability of CN membrane quantitatively at room tem-

perature, which is deﬁned as:[34]

F =

ν
S × t × ∆P

(5)

Where ν and S represent the moles of gas molecules in the permeate side and

the area of CN membrane, t is the time duration, and the pressure drop (∆P )

is set to 1 bar across the pore.

As shown in the Fig. 6, the 4 × 4 supercell with a height of 90 ˚A is divided

into three parts of the same capacity. Periodic boundary conditions along the

lateral directions are imposed to mimic the inﬁnite ﬁlm. At the beginning of

each simulation, the gas reservoir, consisting of 40 He molecules, 40 Ne molecules

and 40 Ar molecules, is initially located in the middle part of the supercell, that

is, between the two monolayers of CN. The van der Waals interactions and

Ewald electrostatic interactions are applied with a cutoﬀ distance of 9.5 ˚A.

Each simulation is carried out for a time period of 10 ns with a time−step

of 1 f s.

In the process of simulations, due to the existing of diﬀerence in

gas concentration among diﬀerent spaces, the molecules are pushed cross the

sheet into the vacuum region. After 10 ns simulation, the ﬁnal conﬁgurations

under 0%, −3% and −6% strain at room temperature are shown in Fig. 6.

Some of Ne atoms pass through the pristine CN membrane [see Fig. 6(a)], and

there are still several Ne atoms penetrate the membrane under a small strain

of −3% [see Fig. 6(b)], which are consistent with the low penetration barriers

in Fig. 3(a) and (b). However, under a −6% strain [see Fig. 6(c)], 27 He in 40

molecules pass through CN ﬁlm to the vacuum space, without any Ne and Ar

penetrating. The MD simulations further conﬁrm that the strain−controlled

nanoporous CN membrane can be applied in the puriﬁcation of He from other

noble gas molecules.

8

The calculated He permeance of porous CN monolayer under −6% strain

with area of 28.48 × 28.48 ˚A2 together with that of the previously proposed

porous monolayer are summarized in Table 3. The strain−modiﬁed CN mem-

brane exhibits a He permeability as high as 1.94 × 107 GPU at 300 K, which

is almost twice that of C2N, and 270 times greater than that of the porous

graphene (PG), far much higher than the industrially acceptable gas separation

value of 20.[33]

4. Conclusions

Combining DFT−D2 calculations and classical MD simulation, we predict

that strained porous CN monolayer can be used for He separation with high

selectivity and permeability. The pristine CN is permeable for both He and

Ne because of the lower barriers than threshold value. The energy barriers

of gas molecules can be eﬀectively modulated by biaxial compressive strain

to the membrane. Subjecting the CN membrane to a −6% strain results in

non−passability of Ne and exceptionally high selectivity for He/Ne (Ar) at

300 K. Meanwhile, the MD simulations further verify that the strained CN

membrane exhibits a high He permeance of 1.94×107 GPU, which is superior to

those of PG and C2N sheets. Our results demonstrate that strain is an eﬃcient

strategy to tune the separation performance of low−dimensional materials and

reveal that strain−controlled CN monolayer has great potential application in

He separation.
