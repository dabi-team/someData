Peculiarities of the Dynamics of Solar NOAA Active Region 12673

ABSTRACT

The dynamics of active region (AR) 12673 is qualitatively studied using observational data obtained with
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager of the Solar Dynamics Observatory on August 31–September 8, 2017.
This AR was remarkable for its complex structure and extraordinary ﬂare productivity. The sunspot group
in this AR consisted of (1) an old, well-developed and highly stable, coherent sunspot, which had also been
observed two solar rotations earlier, and (2) a rapidly developing cluster of umbral and penumbral fragments.
Cluster (2) formed two elongated, arc-shaped chains of spot elements, skirting around the major sunspot (1),
with two chains of magnetic elements spatially coinciding with the arcs. AR components (1) and (2) were in
relative motion, cluster (2) overtaking spot (1) in westward motion, and their relative velocity agrees in order
of magnitude with the velocity jump over the near-surface shear layer, or leptocline. The pattern of motion
of the features about the main spot bears amazing resemblance to the pattern of a ﬂuid ﬂow about a roundish
body. This suggests that spot (1) was dynamically coupled with the surface layers, while cluster (2) developed
in deeper layers of the convection zone. The magnetic-ﬂux emergence in cluster (2) appeared to be associated
with ﬂuid motions similar to roll convection. The mutual approach of components (1) and (2) gave rise to light
bridges in the umbrae of sunspots with the magnetic ﬁeld having the same sign on both sides of the bridge.

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar NOAA active region (AR) 12673, which was ob-
served in September 2017, was remarkable for its complex
structure and extraordinary ﬂare productivity—the highest in
Solar Cycle 24 (Yang et al. 2017; Attie et al. 2018; Hou et al.
2018). It produced 4 ﬂares above X1 class and 8 ﬂares above
M3 class; moreover, its X-9.3 ﬂare (on 2017 September 6,
11:53 UT) was the most intense one since 2005 (see, e.g.,
Sun & Norton 2017). The behavior of the ﬂow and magnetic
ﬁeld in this AR deserves special attention. In particular, the
magnetic-ﬁeld and sunspot dynamics suggests that diﬀerent
parts of this complex aggregate might be dynamically cou-
pled with diﬀerent layers of the solar convection zone and
atmosphere.

The sunspot group in AR 12673 consisted of (1) a well-
developed, highly stable, coherent sunspot with a magnetic
ﬁeld exceeding 2 kG, which had previously existed, and (2) a
cluster of umbral and penumbral fragments, which emerged
on 2017 September 2 and fused later into new larger spots.
We will see that component (2) was not deﬁnitely opposite

to spot (1) in its polarity, so that the whole magnetic conﬁg-
uration of AR 12673 could not be classiﬁed as a bipolar one.
Sunspot (1), as its position on the solar disk suggests, was
already present two solar rotations before cluster (2) started
developing (Figure 1a), being the leading spot of a regular
bipolar group attributed to AR 12665. One rotation later,
this sunspot appeared to be unipolar, belonging to AR 12670
(Figure 1b).

The evolution of AR 12673 (Figures 1c–1e) as the main
subject of this study will be discussed below. Now, we only
note that a unipolar sunspot was also present one and two
rotations after the period of development of AR 12673 not far
from its location, being attributed to ARs 12682 and 12685
(Figures 1f and 1g, respectively).

This study follows the avenue of investigation of the AR
and sunspot-group formation mechanisms as outlined by
Getling & Buchnev (2019) and based on parallel analyses
of the magnetic and velocity ﬁelds simultaneously recorded
in an AR. Currently available observational facilities provide
a wealth of data admitting multifaceted description of the
MHD processes in question. This should be highly promising
in terms of understanding the physical mechanisms involved.

Our study is based on data from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) of the Solar Dynamics Observa-
tory (SDO), which are stored at and available from the Joint
Science Operations Center (JSOC, http://jsoc.stanford.edu).
Speciﬁcally, we use a Spaceweather HMI Active Re-
gion Patch (SHARP; see Bobra et al. 2014) with the data
remapped to a heliographic Lambert cylindrical equal-area
projection (CEA). This automatically selected patch is cen-
tered at the ﬂux-weighted centroid of the AR. The magnetic-

ﬁeld vector in the SHARP is decomposed into a radial (ver-
tical), latitudinal and longitudinal components. The Dopp-
lergrams are also CEA-remapped but not projected, still rep-
resenting the line-of-sight, rather than radial, velocity com-
ponent. We neglect the projection eﬀects taking advantage
of the fact that the AR was not far from the disk center on
September 2–4, and the diﬀerence between the line-of-sight
and the radial (vertical) component was not important.

As can be found from the headers of the downloaded FITS
data ﬁles, the Carrington longitude of the center of this patch
changed by 2.8 heliographic degrees over the 8-day period
considered (2017 August 31, 00:00 TAI–2017 September 8,
00:00 TAI), the latitude being naturally constant. Alterna-
tively to the SHARPs, JSOC oﬀers a possibility of selecting,
for a given AR, CEA-remapped arbitrarily sized continuum-
intensity image patches with a ﬁxed Carrington longitude;
such images can be downloaded with time cadences down to
45 s—in contrast to the SHARPs, which have a cadence of
12 minutes. We use the short-cadence patches to construct
full-vector velocity maps with the horizontal velocities com-
puted by a modiﬁed local-correlation-tracking (LCT) tech-
nique (Getling & Buchnev 2010). To jointly analyze the two
sets of images, we cut out fragments coaligned with the short-
cadence patches from the SHARPs, using the values of the
Carrington longitude indicated in the FITS headers.

The pixel size of the HMI images is 0.5 arcsec ≈ 366 km.
The SHARP under study originally measures 547 × 372 pix-
els, or 200 × 136 Mm2, and the size of short-cadence patches
and our SHARP cutouts is 400 × 400 pixels, or 146.4 × 146.4
Mm2.

We apply Fourier subsonic ﬁltering (Title et al. 1989) with
a cutoﬀ phase speed of 4 km s−1 to the continuum images and
Dopplergrams taken with a cadence of 45 s. To eliminate the
velocity ﬂuctuations on a granular scale, we smooth the line-
of-sight velocities and reduce each smoothed Dopplergram
to zero average.

The LCT procedure is applied here to a sequence of images
selected with a cadence of 135 s. For this procedure to be
successful, we magnify the images doubling the number of
pixels in each horizontal dimension with the use of a standard
bilinear-interpolation procedure. To obtain ﬁnal representa-
tions of the horizontal-velocity ﬁeld, we either average the
measured velocities over nine time steps (20 minutes 15 s),
which yields vector velocity maps, or integrate the displace-
ments of imaginary corks, or test particles, distributed over
the area of interest, thus constructing cork trajectories for 2-
hour time intervals.

We will be interested in assessing the proper motions of
the two components of the AR. However, the motion of clus-
ter (2), consisting of a multitude of small features, can hardly
be inferred from the LCT-based velocity ﬁeld, which gives
an idea of the local ﬂow structure but does not yield the bulk
velocity of the cluster. This is why, along with employing the
LCT technique, we estimate horizontal photospheric veloci-
ties by tracking the motion of some clear-cut features in the
images, such as pores, umbral islands, and penumbral frag-
ments. To this end, we visually identify these in a sequence
of images and read their coordinates. The advantage of this
approach stems from the possibility of choosing most repre-

sentative markers of plasma motion and obtaining results less
aﬀected by (convective) noises.

3. EVOLUTION OF THE ACTIVE REGION

Figure 2 gives an overview of the evolution of AR 12673
as seen in white-light images and in magnetic-ﬁeld vector
maps (note that the both are not equally spaced in time). The
coordinates x and y are measured in the longitudinal and the
latitudinal direction, respectively. During the ﬁrst two days
after 2017 August 31, 00:00 TAI, the starting point of our
consideration, the AR is represented in essence by only one
isolated, well-developed positive-polarity sunspot (which has
apparently survived two solar rotations that have elapsed af-
ter the decay of AR 12665); remember that we denote it as
component (1) of the AR. It has a fairly regular structure with
a nearly axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld, which exceeds 2300 G
at the spot center (see the upper panel of Figure 2). In the
Carrington frame of reference, the spot shifts eastward.
It
is remarkable in terms of its stability:
it largely preserves
its structure even at the later stage of strong interaction with
cluster (2) consisting of smaller, less regular features.

On September 2, cluster (2) starts developing south–
southeast of sunspot (1). A multipolar magnetic pattern
emerges together with small spots, pores, and fragments of
penumbra (panel for September 3, 00:00, in Figure 2). Dur-
ing September 3, the cluster extends both longitudinally and
especially latitudinally, acquiring a speciﬁc arc-shaped struc-
ture. Two elongated, bow-shaped chains of spot elements
skirting around the major sunspot (1) originate, with two
chains of magnetic elements spatially coinciding with them.
The western chain is of the positive polarity, and the east-
ern one, of the negative polarity (see panel for September 3,
18:00). We will designate this evolutionary stage as the two-
arc stage . These features persist over a certain time interval,
the magnetic ﬁeld being enhanced but the whole pattern ex-
periencing only moderate complications in its structure (see
panel for September 4, 00:00). At later times, the interaction
between AR components (1) and (2) becomes so strong that
the pattern of sunspots and magnetic ﬁeld undergoes dra-
matic changes (panel for September 6, 00:00). It is worth
noting that the ﬁrst ﬂare in this AR occurred near the end
of the two-arc stage (on September 3, at 20:45), while all
other ﬂares took place after a signiﬁcant complication of the
magnetic ﬁeld, starting from September 4, 22:10.

It is the two-arc stage of the evolutionary scenario that will
be of particular interest to us. Before and during this stage,
the pattern of sunspots and magnetic ﬁeld remains relatively
ordered and can give some insight into the underlying physi-
cal mechanisms.

Even a visual inspection of the panels of Figure 2 for
September 3, 18:00, and September 4, 00:00, reveals that
AR components (1) and (2) are in relative motion, coming

close to each other. To quantify this motion, let us keep
track of some features identiﬁable with most certainty in the
optical images of the AR. Information on these features is
summarized in Table 1; for each feature, it presents the ini-
tial, tstart, and the ﬁnal, tﬁn, time of the interval for which
the feature was tracked (in hours, measured from August 31,
00:00), the initial (xstart, ystart) and the ﬁnal (xﬁn, yﬁn) local co-
ordinates of the feature (in Mm) in the short-cadence patches
(ﬁxed to the Carrington frame of reference), and the mean x-
velocity of the feature (in Mm hr−1) deﬁned as ∆x/∆t, where
∆x = xﬁn − xstart and ∆y = tﬁn − tstart. The movements of these
features are also shown by Figure 3a in the form of tracks on
the longitude–latitude plane in the Carrington frame of ref-
erence and by Figure 3b in a longitude–time diagram, with
each track labeled by the feature number in both panels.

Feature 0 is the main sunspot, or component (1) of the AR.
Its track is shown by a heavy curve both in Figure 3a and Fig-
ure 3b. This spot exhibits only a moderate shift in the Car-
rington frame of reference with a mean x-velocity of about
−0.023 Mm hr−1. The tracks of other features mainly refer
to the two-arc stage and to the stage of subsequent compli-
cation of the entire pattern, September 3 and 4 (times of 72–
120 hr). What attracts one’s attention in Figure 3b is the fact
that most features in the right-hand part of the diagram (re-
gion x > 65 Mm) move westward, while a few features (6, 7,
11, 13, 14) in its left-hand part exhibit eastward drift. The en-
tire ﬂow pattern appears more consistent as considered in the
longitude–latitude plane (Figure 3a). It becomes clear that
these movements are predominantly directed along the arcs,
roughly, to the northwest in the northern part of the pattern
and to the southwest in its southern part (more precisely, the
separatrix between the northward and southward streams is
directed to the southeast of the main spot). Very few features
exhibit arc-aligned movements directed oppositely compared
to nearby features, so that countercurrent streams are inter-
mixed to a certain extent: feature 13 moves oppositely com-
pared to nearby features 3, 5, 10, 15, and features 7 and 11
move oppositely compared to feature 8. There are also mo-
tions across the arcs (features 1, 4, 6); they can be revealed
more clearly from velocity maps and will be discussed below.
While feature 0 (the main sunspot) slightly shifts eastward,
the cluster comprising other features moves as a whole west-
ward, as can be grasped from Figure 3. This is apparent de-
spite the presence of inner motions superposed on the bulk
motion of the cluster. The data presented in Table 1 and vi-
sualized in Figure 3 make it possible to estimate the relative
velocity of spot (1) and cluster (2). Comparatively stable and
well localized features are few in number, and averaging their
velocities implies fairly large mean absolute deviations (they
are indicated in the table). Nevertheless, a ﬁgure of order
0.3 Mm hr−1 seems to be a realistic estimate for the west-

ward velocity of the cluster relative to the Carrington frame
of reference and to the main spot.

On the whole, as Figure 3a demonstrates, the pattern of
motion of the features about the main spot bears amazing
resemblance to the pattern of a ﬂuid ﬂow about a roundish
body. At the same time, the pattern of local inner motions
in cluster (2), as obtained using the LCT technique, exhibits
some likeness to the pattern of roll thermal convection. This
is most pronounced at the two-arc stage of AR development
and illustrated in Figure 4a by a full-vector velocity map and
in Figure 4b by a map of cork trajectories: the ﬂow pattern
is like that of a couple of bowed convection rolls with su-
perposed arc-aligned motions, as schematically sketched in
Figure 4c.

The indications for a roll ﬂow are not very surprising by
themselves: roll-like motions were previously detected in the
solar photosphere (Getling 2006; Getling & Buchnev 2008).
In our case, it is remarkable that (i) roll motions can be de-
tected in the area where a relatively strong magnetic ﬁeld
with a fairly complex structure is present and (ii) the roll-
ﬂow pattern interacts with an obstacle moving relative to this
pattern, i.e., with the coherent magnetic ﬁeld of the main
sunspot, and experiences deformations due to this interac-
tion. Fine details complicating the pattern seemingly reﬂect
a considerable role of the magnetic ﬁeld aﬀecting the ﬂow.

4. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION

Our interpretation of the above-described evolution pattern
of AR 12673 is based on the available information on the
diﬀerential rotation of the Sun. We use data of helioseis-
mological inversions determining the rotation rate of deeper
layers. In particular, the diﬀerence in the rotation rate across
the near-surface shear layer, or leptocline, can be estimated
based on Figure 1 of Howe et al. (2000). Speciﬁcally, at
a latitude of ϕ = ±9◦, nearly corresponding to the latitude
of AR 12673, the rotation frequency Ω/2π increases from
the surface to depths of about 0.04R(cid:12) by ∆Ω/2π ≈ 15 nHz
(having characteristic values of about 460 nHz). The corre-
sponding linear-velocity shear in a solidly rotating frame of
reference is ∆u = ∆Ω R(cid:12) cos ϕ = 0.24 Mm hr−1, which is a
quantity of the same order of magnitude as the relative veloc-
ity of the main sunspot (1) and cluster (2), 0.3 Mm hr−1. This
suggests that the main sunspot may be dynamically coupled
to higher layers than the cluster. The well-developed, stable
magnetic feature—sunspot (1)—extends through the lepto-
cline but moves with the surface layers, while the plasma of
the deeper layers ﬂows about this magnetic obstacle together
with cluster (2). The long prehistory of sunspot (1) may be a
fair indication that it has had time to become “ﬁxed” to near-
photospheric layers, whereas the fresh cluster magnetic ﬁeld
developing at deeper levels has not.

TAI, with three light bridges (labeled with letters) intersecting the
umbrae of sunspots.

We can also put forward some tentative considerations of
the magnetic-ﬁeld emergence in cluster (2) during the two-
arc stage. The observed pattern of this process resembles the
interaction of a couple of convection rolls with a horizontal
magnetic sheet lying at a certain depth. The ﬁeld in this sheet
should be directed from west to east. As it is carried by the
upﬂow, which extends along the join between the two con-
vection rolls, and then stretched by the diverging eastward
and westward ﬂows, is can form the negative and the positive
arc observed along the downﬂow portions of the rolls.

5. NOTE ON THE FORMATION OF LIGHT BRIDGES

In addition, an interesting comment can be made in passing
on the formation process of light bridges in sunspot umbrae.
This phenomenon is typically attributed to the decay stage of
sunspots (see, e.g., Felipe et al. 2016, where, in particular,
a comprehensive survey of light-bridge properties is given).
AR 12673, which we consider here, demonstrates a diﬀerent
scenario of the development of light bridges. Bridges A–C
in Figure 5 formed as spot (1) and cluster (2) came close to-
gether to form a more complex sunspot; they appear as rem-
nants of the bright space that previously separated the two
components of the sunspot group. These bridges can be clas-
siﬁed as strong light bridges (Felipe et al. 2016): the mag-
netic ﬁeld on both sides of them has the same polarity.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have analyzed the dynamics of AR 12673 us-
ing SDO/HMI data for 2017 August 31, 00:00 TAI–
2017 September 8, 00:00 TAI. The sunspot group in this
AR consisted of (1) an old, well-developed and highly sta-
ble, coherent sunspot and (2) a rapidly developing cluster
of umbral and penumbral fragments. The most remarkable
manifestation of the cluster evolution is the formation of
two elongated, arc-shaped chains of spot elements skirting

8

Getling

around the major sunspot (1), with two chains of magnetic
elements spatially coinciding with the arcs (the two-arc evo-
lutionary stage). The western chain is of the positive polarity,
and the eastern one, of the negative polarity. Components (1)
and (2) are in relative motion, coming close to each other;
in its westward motion, cluster (2) is overtaking spot (1) at a
speed of order 0.3 Mm hr−1.

On the whole, the pattern of motion of the features about
the main spot bears amazing resemblance to the pattern of
a ﬂuid ﬂow about a roundish body. Together with the es-
timate of the relative speed of components (1) and (2) and
in view of the existence of a near-surface shear layer, or
leptocline, this suggests that the main spot may be dynam-
ically coupled to higher layers than the cluster. According
to helioseismological data, at the latitude of AR 12673, in a
solidly rotating frame of reference, the linear-velocity shear
between the photosphere and the base of the leptocline (a
depth of 0.04R(cid:12)) is 0.24 Mm hr−1. A velocity increase, rel-
ative to the photosphere, of the order of the estimated rel-
ative speed of sunspot (1) and cluster (2) should therefore
be achieved at depths comparable to the leptocline thickness.
Likely, the well-developed, stable magnetic feature—sunspot
(1)—extends through the leptocline but moves with the sur-
face layers, while the plasma of the deeper layers ﬂows about
this magnetic obstacle together with cluster (2). The long
prehistory of spot (1) may be fair indication that it has had
time to become “ﬁxed” to near-photospheric layers, whereas
the fresh cluster magnetic ﬁeld developing at deeper levels

has not.
It seems reasonable to ﬁnd out in further studies
whether relatively low revolution rates is a distinctive prop-
erty of old, stable sunspots.

The pattern of local inner motions in cluster (2) exhibits
some likeness to the pattern of roll thermal convection. The
observed pattern of magnetic-ﬁeld emergence in cluster (2)
during the two-arc evolutionary stage resembles the interac-
tion of a couple of convection rolls with a horizontal mag-
netic sheet lying at a certain depth.

During the evolution of AR 12673, a few light bridges de-
velop in the sunspot group. The formation of some of them
is deﬁnitely not related to the decay of sunspots; in contrast,
they are remnants of the bright space between the spots that
have come close to each other. These bridges can be classi-
ﬁed as strong light bridges: the magnetic ﬁeld has the same
polarity on both sides of them.

We see that the pattern of relative motion of diﬀerent pho-
tospheric features may prove to be informative about the in-
teraction of diﬀerent near-photospheric layers. The diagnos-
tic value of the ﬂow patterns seems to deserve further inves-
tigation, in particular, with invoking helioseismological data.
