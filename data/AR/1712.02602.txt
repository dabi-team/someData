More than 99% of the mass in the visible universe –
the material that makes up ourselves, our planet, stars
– is in the atomic nucleus. Although the matter has ex-
isted for billions of years, only over the past few decades
have we had the tools and the knowledge necessary to
get a basic understanding of the structure and dynamic
of nuclei. Nuclear physicists around the world have made
tremendous strides by initiating a broad range of key
questions that can be best attacked with various exper-
imental probes at diﬀerent beam energies. Moreover,
through these eﬀorts, we have gained access to the origin
of elements and the nucleosynthesis processes that were
and still are shaping the world we are living in.

The energy region at around 300 MeV gives rise to
the so-called energy window for nuclear structure stud-
ies. At this energy range, the distortion eﬀects on the
projectile wave functions are relatively small due to the
weak strength of the scalar-isoscalar interaction, which
further suppresses the multistep processes in the nuclear
reaction mechanism. This brings advantages in study-
ing nuclear spin and isospin excitations [1] and nucleon
density distribution of very exotic nuclei characterized
by short lifetimes and very diﬀerent isospins from the
stable ones [2, 3]. Quantitive investigations in the two
topics can yield precision information on the weak inter-
action processes and on how protons and neutrons are
distributed in atomic nuclei. They play important roles
not only in nuclear physics but also in astrophysics for
stellar events such as supernovae explosions.

Experimentally, such investigations are closely linked
to the availability of separators and spectrometers to se-
lect and identify the rare isotopes of interest at relativis-
tic energies of around 300 MeV/nucleon (about 65% of
the speed of light). Among all the separators operating at
energies more than300 MeV/nucleon worldwide, the Sec-
ond Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou (RIBLL2),
one of the key components in the Heavy Ion Research
Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL-CSR) [4] at IMP, China, is
unique to have an asymmetric double achromatic conﬁg-
uration.

RIBLL2 was constructed in 2007 connecting the syn-
chrotron cooler storage main ring (CSRm) and the exper-
imental storage ring (CSRe) in the HIRFL-CSR complex.
It has been utilized to deliver radioactive isotopes into
the CSRe for mass measurements [5]. Yet its full poten-
tial as an individual experimental terminal has not been
explored. The schematic layout of RIBLL2 and external
target facility (ETF) is shown in Fig. 1(a).

RIBLL2 has four independent sections, each consisting
of a 25◦ dipole magnet and a set of quadrupole magnets
before and after the dipole to fulﬁll ﬁrst-order focusing
conditions. Additional 8 hexapole and 4 octupole mag-
nets are equipped for higher-order corrections. The whole
separator is about 55 meters long, while the ﬁrst half
(F0-F2) and the second half (F2-F4) are about 26 and
29 meters, respectively. Shown in Fig. 1(b) is the ﬁrst
order ion-optics in the horizontal plane calculated by GI-
COSY [6]. The foci at F2 and F4 are fully achromatic.
The ﬁrst half (F0-F2) is a mirror-symmetric system, and
can realize a point-to-point image. The proﬁle of the
second half (F2-F4) is almost reversed to the ﬁrst half
to further purify rare-isotope beam (RIB). A maximum
dispersion of 1.169 m/% can be reached at the dispersive
planes F1 and F3. Considering the magniﬁcation factor
of -0.48 from F0 to F1 (or from F2 to F3), the momen-
tum resolution power of 1200 can be expected for a beam
size at half width of 1 mm.

Here we report the recent decisive progress in particle
identiﬁcation for relativistic heavy-ion fragments using
RIBLL2. About 80 isotopes have been produced and
identiﬁed unambiguously. For the ﬁrst time, we demon-
strated that in combination with the external target ter-
minal the ﬁrst half of RIBLL2 is able to deliver, separate
and identify rare isotopes with the proton number Z<30.
In the experiments, heavy ions were extracted from
CSRm to bombard a primary target (PT) placed at the
entrance of RIBLL2. Rare nuclei of interest were then
separated in ﬂight with the ﬁrst half of RIBLL2 (F0-F2)
and delivered to ETF. The magnetic rigidity (Bρ) of RIB
was ﬁnely selected by a pair of horizontal passive slits at

FIG. 1: (Color online) (a) A schematic layout of the RIBLL2
beam line. The labels Dn and Fn indicate the positions of
dipole magnets and foci, respectively. PT and ST represent
the primary target, reaction target, respectively. At each fo-
cus, PS (plastic scintillator), DC (drift chamber), Si (Silicon
detector), MUSIC (multi-sampling ionization chamber), slit
and degrader indicate the types of detectors or devices that
have been installed (black letters) or will be installed (red
letters). Horizontal beam trajectories are calculated with the
ﬁrst-order optics by GICOSY for the full RIBLL2 (F0 to F4)
(b) and RIBLL2-ETF (c). 18O8+ at 400 MeV/nucleon with
a momentum dispersion of ±2% was used in both calcula-
tions. The beam emittance of 20π and 75π mm mrad was
used in the calculation of RIBLL2 (b) and RIBLL2-ETF (c)
conﬁgurations, respectively.

F1. Figure 1 (c) shows the proﬁle in the horizontal plane
of the separator up to ETF. A spot size of typically about
5 mm (FWHM), and an emittance of less than about 100
πmm mrad have been obtained at ETF.

Particle identiﬁcation with respect to nuclear mass
number A and mass-to-charge ratio A/Q is achieved by
coincidence measurements of the energy loss (∆E) at
ETF, Bρ analysis at the dispersive focal plane F1, and
the time-of-ﬂight (TOF) determination by two plastic
scintillators placed at F1 and ETF. ∆E is measured typi-
cally with a large-area stack silicon detector or a multiple-
sampling ionization chamber (MUSIC) [7].

Figure 2 summarizes the continuously marked progress
towards a better isotopic identiﬁcation in the past years.
They correspond to the cocktail beams produced by
360 MeV/nucleon 16O on a 15mm-thick Be target, 400
MeV/nucleon 18O on a 30 mm-thick Be target, and 320
MeV/nucleon 40Ar on a 10 mm-thick Be target, respec-
tively. This achievement of the isotopic resolution is
mainly attributed to the improvement in the beam ion
optics and the detector system of both timing and energy
loss determination. In total 77 isotopes were produced

the 16O, 18O and 40Ar fragments in three experiments per-
formed in 2013 (a), 2015 (b) and 2016 (c), respectively. The
same ion species groups together in the TOF-∆E scatter plot.
Labelled are several selected identiﬁed isotopes. The energy

and identiﬁed via the fragmentations of 18O and 40Ar (see
Supplementary material Table I). In particular, Fig. 2(c)
corresponds to the Bρ setting centered in 26Na (see Sup-
plementary material Table II for the relative production
yields). The experimental results show that the ﬁrst half
of RIBLL2 is already capable of identifying all ions with
Z<30.

Due to the inevitable channeling eﬀect in silicon de-
tectors (see in particular the 17N case in Fig. 2(b)), the
MUSIC detector is preferred for relativistic heavy ions. A
charge resolution of 0.12 (σ) has been achieved as demon-
strated in Fig. 2(c), and it does not change for the range
of elements measured here.

The intrinsic TOF resolution (σ) from detectors is de-

by one PMT at F1 is a plastic scintillator with a cross-
section of 100 mm × 100 mm and a thickness of 3 mm.
Such relatively large size is required to cover the large
beam emittance at the F1 dispersive plane. The TOF-
stop detector at ETF has a dimension of 50 mm × 50mm
× 3 mm, and is viewed by two fast PMTs positioned at
both ends of the plastic scintillator.
Its intrinsic time
resolution is determined to be about 30 ps (σ) [8, 9].

The initial Bρ or momentum spread from the fragmen-
tation process is the dominant source for the ﬁnal mass
resolution. A detector with a position resolution of less
than 0.5 mm at F1 can make a precise Bρ measurement
possible and this can further improve the mass resolution.
A full commissioning RIBLL2 requires a complete de-
tector system for both the beam monitoring and the ion
tracing measurements (see Fig. 1(a)), which brings ad-
vantages in a better isotopic puriﬁcation due to more
freedom to manipulate magnetically the secondary ions
and in better isotopic identiﬁcation ability due to a much
longer TOF path length. The total TOF length is 42 me-
ters from F1 to F4. This is by 16 meters longer than that
of RIBLL2-ETF, thus a much better separation quality
can be expected for heavier nuclear system.

In particular, the unique asymmetric arrangement pro-
vides a natural way to operate RIBLL2 in the separator-
spectrometer mode. The ﬁrst stage (half) of RIBLL2
can be used to produce and separate RIB with the
Bρ − ∆E − Bρ method (see Fig. 1(a)-(b)). An energy
degrader for ∆E analysis will be installed at F1. A sec-
ondary reaction target can be placed at the achromatic
focus F2. Then the second stage (F2-F4) can work as a
high-resolution zero-degree spectrometer, to analyze and
identify further the outgoing reaction products with the
standard TOF-Bρ-∆E on an event-by-event basis. An-
other energy degrader can be placed at F3 to further
purify the RIBs. Such a full realization of the RIBLL2
beam line is going to open new opportunities for address-
ing many interesting and important nuclear structure
problems at around 300 MeV/nucleon, one of which is
a new direct method to weigh masses of most neutron-
rich atomic nuclei [10]. It should be also mentioned that
the development of RIBLL2 would provide a very valu-
able experience to design the high-energy fragment sepa-
rator at the High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility
(HIAF) [11] in China.
