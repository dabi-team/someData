Abstract 

Time  integrated  spectroscopic  measurements  are  carried  out  to  characterize  transient  plasma 

stream  produced  in  a  coaxial  pulsed  plasma  accelerator.  This  method  allows  the  estimation  of 

different  plasma  parameters  and  its  evolution  with  time.  It  also  provides  information  on  the 

existence of different excited states from the spectral emissions of plasma. Using Argon as the 

discharge medium, the electron density estimated from Stark broadened line profiles gives a peak 

value ̴ 5 × 1021 m-3 at a discharge voltage of 15 kV and the flow velocity of the plasma stream is 

measured to be ̴ (22 + 5) Km using Doppler shift method. Assuming p-LTE model, the electron 

excitation temperature is found to be ̴ 0.88 eV using Boltzmann plot method. A temporal evolution 

of the plasma stream and its characteristic variation is studied from a time of 50 µs – 300 µs in 

steps of 50 µs by adjusting delay time in the triggering.  Analysis of different spectral lines shows 

the existence of some metastable states of Ar II having a long lifetime. The evolution of different 

Ar II transitions to metastable and non-metastable lower levels is observed for different time frame. 

The temporal evolution study shows a decrease in electron density from 1.96 × 1021 m-3 to 1.23 × 

1020 m-3at 300 µs after the initiation of plasma formation. A decrease in excitation temperature 

from 0.86 eV to 0.72 eV is observed till 250 µs and then again rises to 0.77 eV at 300 µs.

1.  Introduction: 

Pulsed Plasma Accelerators (PPA) are a source of transient plasma which provide a high density, 

high velocity plasma stream. The typical nature of the plasma stream makes it front  runner for 

many applications like plasma matter interaction (PMI) of fusion interest [1,2], fueling to fusion   

device [3], in material processing [4,5], space propulsion [6], study of astrophysical jets [7] etc. 

For  these  applications,  detailed  characterization  of  the  plasma  stream  is  necessary  and  this  is 

carried  out  by  using  many  diagnostic  tools  like  electrostatic  probes  and  Optical  Emission 

Spectroscopy (OES), Interferometry, Thomson scattering etc.  It is generally seen that the insitu 

measurements by electrostatic probes are widely used, but faces certain limitations as it obstructs 

the plasma. On the other hand, OES is used by many researchers since it is a remote measurement 

technique  where  the  scope  of  causing  any  perturbation  to  the  plasma  is  completely  ruled  out. 

Morever, it is less complex and cost effective as compared to other optical methods which qualifies 

it  to  be  a  promising  and  reliable  diagnostic  in  plasma  studies  [8–12].  Further,  OES  provides 

information  about  the  constituents  of  plasma  including  the  impurity  particles  from  different 

elements present in the plasma. In addition to element identification, several works involving the 

use of OES for plasma parameter determination and study of temporal evolution is being reported 

[13,14]. This work presents time integrated spectroscopic measurements for different time frame 

of plasma life (time window) that are carried out to study the characteristics of the transient plasma 

stream produced in a pulsed plasma accelerator. In this method of  OES measurement, the duration 

of emitted light collected from plasma can be changed adjusting the delay to the triggering of OES. 

2 

 
 
Therefore  by adjusting the delay time to  triggering with respect to initial bearkdown of the plasma, 

we can have collected time integrated emission spectrum of the plasma from the trigger time till 

the dying out time of the plasma. 

Here,  different  plasma  parameters  such  as  plasma  flow  velocity,  plasma  density,  and  electron 

excitation  temperature  are  estimated  using  this  non-invasive  spectroscopic  technique.  The 

initialization of the plasma and its evolution to till its quenching can be well understood by this 

study and  hence dynamical behavior of plasma parameters can be well documented. The plasma 

stream observed in this way at different time window corresponding to different delay times has 

provided  information  on  different  spectral  emissions.  The  temporal  variation  of  density  and 

excitation temperature of the plasma stream is obtained from the evolution study. This study also 

reveals the emission from different atomic particles of the working gas from different excitation 

and ionization levels. This information provides an insight to the equilibrium state of the transient 

plasma and its behavior with time evolution. A study of this kind is found to be limited only to 

few systems and lack an elaborate analysis of the subject in these type of transient plasma devices. 

This attempt is considered to be helpful in understanding the dynamics of a transient plasma stream 

having a comparatively longer lifetime than the conventional ones [1,15]. 

2.  Experimental setup and diagnostics arrangement: 

The pulsed plasma accelerator (PPA)  is a two electrode system of cylindrical geometry. The inner 

electrode, which consists of 13 number of rods,  is the cathode of the electrode system. The cathode 

is concentrically surrounded by an assembly of 17 numbers  of rods to form the outer electrode. 

The outer electrode here is grounded and behaves as anode [16]. The whole experimental chamber 

is initially evacuated to a base pressure of 10-6 mbar  with the help of a turbo-molecular pumping 

3 

 
 
system. The PPA is powered by a 200 kJ pulsed power system (PPS), which delivers a damped 

sinusoidal current pulse for a time period of 1.0 ms with a peak discharge current of around 100 

kA, while operating at 15 kV [17]. The transient high power pulse produced by the PPS is applied 

to  the  set  of  coaxial  electrodes,which  then  energizes  the  plasma  system.  Argon  is  used  as  the 

working  gas  which  is  initially  stored  in  the  plenum  or  storage  unit  of  an  Electromagnetic  Gas 

injection valve (GIV). A Trigger pulse generator [BNC 575] is used for synchronized triggering 

of the main discharge pulse of PPS and the gas injection from the GIV. Different delays can be set 

in the trigger generator which enables triggering of different systems at different times. A delay of 

~ 4 ms is set between the triggering of the PPS and the GIV, so that the discharge occurs when a 

Fig.1. Schematic of Pulsed Plasma Accelerator along with diagnostic arrangement 

substantial amount of gas particles reaches the discharge initiation point in the annular region of 

the  electrodes.  On  triggering  the  GIV,  the  gas  is  injected  into  the  chamber  through  24  nos.  of 

nozzles  present  between  the  coaxial  cathode  and  anode  assemblies.  The  breakdown  of  the  gas 

forms a plasma sheath in the annular region. The plasma sheath moves towards the open end of 

the electrode by the J×B force where J is the current density in the plasma sheath and B is the self 

generated magnetic field. The diffuse plasma sheath moving during the discharge pulse forms the 

4 

 
 
plasma stream and while leaving the electrode the stream is compressed by the radial component 

of  J×B force. The experimental studies in this work is carried out by collecting light from this 

region  of  compression  zone  at  the  exit  of  electrode  assembly.  This  is  performed  by  an  optical 

system arrangement which provides an emission spectrum as described in next section.  

The main part of the of the OES system is a spectrometer working in the visible range of light 

spectrum.  The spectrometer [Avantes AvaSpec-Dual] used here is equipped with a grating of 1200 

lines/mm and 10 µm slit and gives a resolution of 0.1 nm at a blazing wavelength of 500 nm.  The 

sensitivity of the detector lies in the visible spectral wavelength range of 350 - 820 nm. The main 

objective of the work is the identification of the emitted  lines from the plasma, the determination 

of the plasma parameters and the study of the behavior of  plasma stream in different time window 

of its life span. An optical fiber is positioned and mounted on a side viewport of the chamber so 

that it collects light emitted in the radial direction from the plasma stream just at the exit region of 

electrodes  end.  The  other  end  of  the  fiber  is  coupled  to  the  spectrometer.The  triggering  of  the 

spectrometer  is  carried  out  through  the  trigger  pulse  generator,  which  is  synchronized  wih  the 

discharge pulse of PPS. The trigger pulse to the spectrometer is  adjusted by varying the delay time 

with reference to discharge current pulse and this allows the spectrometer to capture the spectrum 

of the plasma stream in different time window. Although a time-integrated spectrum is obtained, 

spectral data of plasma can be collected for different period of plasma lifetime from the trigger 

time to  the  end of the plasma life. Prior to collecting spectra from plasma, the spectrometer is 

calibrated for wavelength with a standard calibration source of Hg-Ar. It is noted that there is no 

other  broadening  mechanism  in  the  calibration  source  so  the  broadening  of  the  spectral  lines 

emitted from Hg-Ar atoms is purely due to the spectrometer. This instrumental broadening of the 

spectrometer is calculated from the FWHM (λI) of the Gaussian profile of the Hg-Ar spectral lines 

5 

 
and is found to be 0.15 nm. After calibration, the emission spectra of plasma beam were collected 

at two different discharge voltages of 8 kV and 15 kV and their spectra were analyzed for deriving 

various plasma parameters such as plasma flow velocity, plasma density and electron excitation 

temperature.  For  our  convenience,  the  experiments  to  collect  spectral  information  for  different 

time window are conducted at lower discharge voltage of 8 kV. The pressure of the plenum of 

GIV is set at 4 bar  for whole experimental work.  

3.  Results and Discussions: 

3.1 Emission spectrum for the entire plasma lifetime and its measurement 

The line emission spectrum is obtained during the entire plasma lifetime as shown in fig. 2. Here, 

the Atomic Spectra Database of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is used for 

identification  of  spectral  lines  [18].  The  emission  spectrum  obtained  from  the  plasma  in  PPA 

shows mostly the lines from singly ionized argon and few other impurity atoms.  The singly ionized 

argon lines are found to be intense and dominant in the spectrum. These lines are mostly located 

in the wavelength range of 400-500 nm. Afew low intense lines from neutral excited argon atoms 

are  also  observed.  These  low  intense  lines  lie  in  the  higher  wavelength  side  of  the  spectrum.  

Moreover,  two  neutral  lines  (763.51  nm,  811.53  nm)  are  also  observed  (as  shown  in  emission 

spectrum) while the intensity of other neutral lines are comparatively low. There are some impurity 

lines and they are identified to be of Fe (354.71 nm, 356.06 nm, 373.13 nm, 378.19 nm, 385.43 

nm, 387.17 nm, 656.53 nm), C (657.80 nm), Mn (357.78 nm) as labeled in the spectrum shown in 

fig. 2. These impurity lines are expected in PPA. This is due to the dragging of the plasma sheath 

during its acceleration down the electrode channel and in the process it erodes electrodes surface. 

The insulator surface coming into the contact of plasma sheath also gets some surface erosion. An 

increase in impurity level is obtained in the plasma produced by higher discharge voltage. Thus, it 

6 

 
 
can be infered that erosion of electrodes and insulator becomes much higher if we apply higher 

discharge voltage to produce the plasma stream.

Another important observation by optical emission spectroscopy is the broadening and shift that 

may occur in an emitting plasma and these measurements can give interesting information about 

electron density, electron temperature, electron excitation temperature and plasma flow velocity. 

Thus the  broadening and shift of the spectral lines which are observed from our plasma stream 

also,  has  given  important  information  about  it.  The  width  of  the  spectral  lines  occurs  due  to 

different  broadening  mechanisms  like  Doppler  broadening,  natural  line  broadening,  pressure 

7 

 
              
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
broadening,  and  Instrumental  broadening.    The  Doppler  broadening  is  caused  due  to  thermal 

motion  of  the  emitters  whereas  the  natural  line  broadening  arises  as  a  result  of  uncertainty 

principle.  The  pressure  broadening  includes  stark  broadening  caused  by  perturbations  due  to 

charged particles,  Vander Waals’ broadening occurring due to  the interaction of emitter dipole 

with the dipole of the surrounding perturbing neutrals and resonance broadening due to dipole-

dipole interaction of emitter atoms with the ground state atoms of the same element [19–21]. The 

Instrumental broadening arises due to finite resolution of the spectrometer and can be calculated 

as  mentioned  earlier.  Besides  broadening  and  shift,  dip  or  flat  top  in  the  spectral  lines  is  also 

observed  which  indicates  presence  of  self-absorption.  This  occurs  due  to  the  absorption  of 

radiation by the cold atoms present in the periphery of the central hot core of plasma stream. The 

self-absorbed  lines  are  known  as  optically  thick  lines  where  the  intensity  of  the  emissions 

decreases and the broadening of the lines increases [22,23]. For measurement pupose, in this work, 

we  have  considered  only  the  lines  which  don’t  have  flat  top  or  dip  structures,  which  implies 

optically thin condition.  The self absorbed lines are discarded as it results in overestimation of 

plasma parameters. For analysis, we fitted the spectral lines to voigt profile, which is a convolution 

of Lorentzian and Gaussian profile. 

3.1.1 Plasma stream velocity 

As mentioned earlier, the plasma sheath formed in the inter-electrode region of the pulsed plasma 

accelerator is accelerated due to Lorentz force. This results in a high flow velocity of plasma stream 

moving towards the outer end of the electrode assembly. For the estimation of this plasma flow 

velocity, the Doppler shift method of light emission is employed [24]. This method involves the 

shift in light frequency due to relative motion of the emitter particles or source of emission in the 

plasma. The emission spectrum is recorded for two different directions of observations. The light 

8 

 
emission is first collected from the open end of the electrodes system in radial direction where line 

of sight is perpendicular to plasma flow direction. The measurements are then taken along the axial 

direction where the line of sight is parallel to the direction of motion of the plasma particles. As 

the plasma stream moves along the axial direction, there is movement of the emitting particles 

towards the detector which causes a blue Doppler shift in the wavelength of the line emission.The 

wavelength of line emission obtained in radial view is considered as the reference wavelength. 

During the axial view,the shift in wavelength observed with respect to the reference wavelength, 

is  used  to  calculate  the  velocity  of  the  emitting  particles  by  using  Doppler  shift  formula.  The 

Doppler shift (Δλ) of spectral line is given by equation (1) as-

Where ‘λ’ is the reference wavelength in nm, ‘v’ is the velocity of the emitting particles in m/s 

and ‘θ’ denotes the angle between line of sight and direction of motion of the emitting particles.

In the axial view, the line of sight is along the direction of motion of the emitting plasma particles 

and this gives a value of unity for the cosine term in eqn. (1). From the emission spectrum obtained 

in both directions, a prominent Ar II spectral line of wavelength 480.60 nm is identified using the 

NIST database. 

Since simultaneous observation is not possible in our case, spectra of 3 shots (1 Shot refers to a 

single gas discharge for plasma formation in PPA) were analyzed for plasma stream velocity at 

same experimental condition of PPA. Using the relation (1), the average velocity of the plasma 

stream  flow,  obtained  from  3  pair  of  consecutive  shots  taken  in    radial and  axial  directions,  is 

estimated to be 22+ 5 km/s.  Similarly, five other spectral lines (434.80 nm, 473.59 nm, 484.78 

nm, 487.98 nm, 500.93 nm) from the same spectra emitted from argon plasma are analyzed to find 

the velocity. The observation shows a variation of plasma flow velocities in the range 10-30 km/s. 

Similar variation of velocity in spectroscopic measurements were also reported by others [25]. It 

is worth mentioning that the plasma flow velocity (~20 Km/s) was theoretically estimated in this 

PPA and experimentally (~ 25 ± 1.5 Km/s) by using Double plate probe, which corroborates our 

estimation in this experimentation [16,26]. 

3.1.2 Plasma Density 

In  plasma,  the  local  micro  electric  fields  exist  due  to  the  presence  of  charged  particles  and  it 

influences or interacts with the surrounding plasma species such as ions or neutral atoms. This 

electric fields perturb the degenerate energy levels of the surrounding atoms or ions. This electric 

field breaks or lifts the degeneracy of the energy levels and splits it into different levels of slightly 

different energies. This is known as the Stark effect which can be commonly observed in plasma 

of  density  >1020 m-3 [27,28].  The  plasma  stream  of  PPA  is  a  high  density  plasma  as  estimated 

earlier by using Triple Langmuir probe which is of the order of 1021 m-3 [29]. Due to the higher 

10 

 
density of plasma, Stark effect is likely to be dominant than the other broadening mechanisms. The 

strong electric fields alter the emission process of the neutrals and ions as the atomic transitions 

taking  place  from  different  closely  spaced  energy  levels  result  in  broadening  and  shift  of  the 

spectral lines. Obradovic et al. measured the macroscopic electric field strength by the stark shift 

caused by macroscopic electric field in Magnetoplasma compressor (MPC) device [30].  

Different models are put forward in literature for the analysis of observed spectral emissions. The 

measurement of electron density by Stark broadening is an indirect method which depends on the 

assumption of the model employed. The broadening and shift of the spectral emissions is due to 

the combined effect of electric fields from ions and electrons. As the high mobility of electrons 

result to fast collisions, therefore an electron impact approximation is used to study the effects on 

line broadening. On the  other hand, due to  slow-moving ions,  a static electric field  is  assumed 

which however depends on the timescale of the electric field variation and the timescale of the 

emitter  dipole  interaction.  For  a  larger  field  variation  timescale,  a  quasi-steady  model  can  be 

assumed. The broadening of spectral lines caused by impact of fast electrons is symmetric and 

follows a Lorentzian profile while those influenced by heavy ions have an asymmetric profile [31]. 

For hydrogen atom or for atoms in which the energy difference between perturbed energy levels 

is  small  in  comparison  to  the  interaction  energy  between  emitter  and  surrounding  perturbing 

plasma  particles,  the  Stark  effect  is  linear.  For  other  non-hydrogenic  atoms,  the  Stark  effect  is 

quadratic. The electron density, Ne (cm-3) can be calculated using the equation (2) which considers 

both  electron  contribution  (first  part  of  the  equation)  and  ion  contribution  (second  part  of  the 

equation) to the line broadening [32,33].

Here, ∆𝜆𝐿is the Lorentzian FWHM of the spectral line in nm, 𝜔 is the electron impact parameter 

in nm, A is the ion broadening parameter in nm, ND is the number of particles in the Debye sphere. 

It is seen that, Hα and Hβ of hydrogen are the most widely used lines for calculation of electron 

density as the highly degenerate states of the hydrogen atoms leads to a linear stark effect. In some 

experiments, hydrogen gas is mixed in lower proportion with the working gas to obtain the Hα and 

Hβ lines for analysis purposes. In our work, there is no hydrogen mixing with the working gas of 

argon and the spectral lines of argon are used for analysis. Some of the most degenerate levels of 

a particular emission are highly perturbed by the intense electric fields resulting in dip structures 

and hence cannot be used for analysis purpose. It is found that the symmetric singly ionized argon 

intense line of 454.50 nm [3p4 (3P) 4p  ̶  3p4 (3P) 4s] is free from such dip structure and thus it is 

used  to  calculate  the  electron  density  from  its  stark  broadening.  The  ion  contribution  to  the 

broadening is considered to be negligible as no asymmetry is observed in the selected line profile

Hence for dominant electron contribution, the second part of eqn. (2) vanishes. The equation thus 

reduces to the form (3) 

                                                          ∆𝜆𝐿 = 2 𝜔 [

The FWHM of Lorentzian profile of the spectral line is obtained after de-convolution of its voigt 

profile as shown in fig. (4). Using this Lorentz width ∆𝜆𝐿 (0.02542 nm) and value of ω [34], the 

plasma density is estimated from the equation (3). The estimated plasma density, which is averaged 

over  for  three  consecutive  shots,  is  found  to  be  around  (5.29  ±  0.38)  ×1021  m-3.  This  value  of 

plasma density is very close to the experimentally measured data using Triple Langmuir probe in 

this device [29]. Similar density has already been observed for plasma streams of  other pulsed 

plasma devices like QSPA Kh-50, QSPA-M, MPC etc. [12,35]. 

3.1.3 Electron excitation temperature 

The excitation temperature in plasma arises due to the transfer of kinetic energy of electrons during 

collisions  with  the  ions  or  neutrals.  It  can  be  assumed  here  that  the  plasma  is  in  partial  local 

thermodynamic equilibrium (p-LTE) where the plasma cannot be defined by a single temperature  

and the electron temperature and excitation temperature are related in this case as Te > Texc [36]. 

The  electrons  in  plasma  establish  equilibrium  between  different  upper-level  populations  of  the 

higher  excited  ions.  Under  the  assumption  of  p-LTE,  the  excited  level  populations  follow  a 

Boltzmann distribution and the emission intensity from these excited levels can be expressed as-

The slope of the plot obtained by the linear fit of data points is found to be (-1.13388). The electron 

excitation  temperature  estimated  from  the  slope  of  the  plot  is  around  0.88  eV  for  Argon.  The 

estimation was carried out for three consecutive shots and a small deviation of 0.003 eV is observed.  

Using theBoltzmann plot method, the electron temperature can be estimated provided the plasma is 

in LTE and the upper energy level gap of the lines used for the plot should be many times greater 

than  the  electron  temperature  (KTe).  This  clearly  shows  that  for  plasma  having  high  electron 

temperature, the Boltzmann plot method cannot be used for estimation of electron temperature and 

gives the electron excitation temperature [37].

3.2  Plasma stream evolution 

The characteristic of the plasma  stream changes from its initiation till its quenching. The evolution 

study of the plasma beam is important to know any variation in the characteristics of the plasma 

and its constituent particles from the initiation of plasma formation to the end of its lifetime. The 

characteristics of such plasma stream at different time of its evolution can be understood with OES 

method by capturing emission spectra at different times.This is done by triggering the spectrometer 

to  record  the  spectral  data  at  different  times  using  a  delay  generator  with  respect  to  plasma 

initiation  at  breakdown  and  this  allows  the  emission  spectrum  to  be  obtained  at  different  time 

window. The shots are taken by applying delay times of 50 µs, 100 µs, 150 µs, 200 µs, 250 µs and 

300  µs  to  the  triggering  of  spectrometer  from  the  initiation  of  the  plasma  produced  by  8  kV 

discharge pulse. Fig. 5 shows the emission spectrum obtained for different delay times. Since the 

trigger point of the spectrometer starts the recording of an emission, hence it can be noted here 

that with 50 µs delay will contain all data of the emission spectrum of the plasma beam excluding  

the initial duration of 50 µs. Similarly for 100 µs, 150 µs, 200 µs, 250 µs and 300 µs delay also, 

the emission spectrum will be collected for other time windows of plasma life excluding the initial 

time frames of 100 µs, 150 µs, 200 µs, 250 µs and 300 µs respectively. This provides information 

depending on the dominant emissions during that time window. It is observed that with increasing 

delay, the excitation and upper-level population decreases which indicates the decrease of energy 

and  dying  out  of  plasma.  Strong  emissions  of  singly  ionized  argon  ions  from  different  upper 

excitation levels having both high and low energy value could be observed till 200 µs from the 

initiation of plasma formation. After 200 µs and onward, transitions occur mostly from low excited 

upper energy level which is observed in the emission spectrum. This indicates the decrease in  

16

17 

 
 
electron energy in the system which results in less energy transfer to the ions and atoms by electron 

collisions. After 300 µs, no prominent emissions are observed as the intensity of the lines is very 

less and the spectrum appears to be noisy. The spectrum obtained at 350 µs delay appeared noisy 

and hence cannot not be considered for analysis. Contrary to the change in intensity of ionic lines 

(Ar  II), no significant  change  in  intensity  of neutral  argon atoms (Ar  I)  is  observed during the 

entire time window. Transitions of Ar I spectral lines obtained in the emission spectrum are due 

to  radiative  decay  from  3p54p  levels  to  3p54s  levels.  The  singly  ionized  argon  (Ar  II)  line 

transitions are from 3p44p to 3p44s levels and few are from 3p44p to 3p43d levels. The emissions 

from the higher excited states are not observed towards later time due to absence of high energy 

electrons in the plasma. Hence, at this stage electrons does not have sufficient energy to excite the 

atoms to higher states. 

                  In this study  we have  also  observed  the  role of metastable states in  the emission of 

plasma.  Using  selection  rules ∆𝐿 = 0, ±1, ∆𝑆 = 0 and ∆𝐽 = 0, ±1 for  optically  allowed 

transitions,  the  metastable  states  of  singly  ionized  argon  are  identified.  The  emission  spectrum 

reveals the presence of transitions to lower levels which are metastable states having a long lifetime 

(10-3 sec to few seconds) and decay from these states are not radiative. Very few transitions occur 

to lower excited level which are not metastable states.The allowed transitions from upper excited 

levels  to  metastable  levels  occur  by  spontaneous  emission  whereas  forbidden  transitions  occur 

from the metastable levels to the ground state by collisions. The allowed transitions are radiative 

and  forbidden  are  non-radiative  transitions.  Excitations  from  the  metastable  states  are  more 

probable and involve less energy. But excitations from ground state require much more energy and 

hence are less probable. Moreover, the electron-impact excitation from the metastable states have 

greater cross-sections than that from the ground state. Due to this, the intensity of the transitions 

18 

 
occurring to metastable lower energy level decreases gradually with time. This is observed in the 

spectrum where the intensity of transitions occurring to non-metastable levels decreases sharply 

with time. Fig. 6 shows the intensity variation of few lines making transitions to metastable and 

non-metastable states, with different delay times. As obtained in the evolution study of the pulsed 

plasma stream, the argon atoms are singly ionized during the first 100  µs from the initiation of 

plasma formation. 

Fig. 6. Spectral line of Ar II  (454.50 nm, 448.18 nm) making transitions to lower non-

metastable  level  whereas  Ar  II  (442.60  nm,  434.80  nm)  making  transitions  to  lower 

metastable level. Figure shows the evolution of the lines with increase in delay time. 

This is confirmed as during that time window, optically allowed transitions to the metastable states 

could be observed from singly ionized argon atoms. Beyond 100 µs, it is seen that the intensity 

indicating the population of the argon states in the metastable levels decreases which indicates that 

no further  ionized argon atoms are  formed  and the ions  are only  excited from  their metastable 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
states. With increase in time delay, depopulation of the metastable states occurs through collisions 

making non-radiative decays to the ground state. 

3.2.1 Temporal evolution of Electron Density 

Using stark broadening as discussed above, the plasma density is estimated from emission spectra  

corresponding  to  different  delay  times.  The  spectral  line  454.50  nm  is  considered  for  density 

calculation for different successive delay time up to 150 µs. Beyond 150 µs, the intense line 484.78 

nm is considered for density calculation, which is free from dip structures at this time window. 

Using the different electron impact parameter for the corresponding lines selected, the densities 

are estimated at different times.  

Fig. 7. Plasma density variation as a function of different delay times 

The accuracy in estimating the density using different spectral lines for different times is checked 

by  calculating  the  error  that  arises.  This  is  done  by  considering  two  more  lines  457.93  nm  ad 

496.50 nm in addition to 454.50 nm line at a particular time upto 150 µs as plotted in figure 7. 

After  150  µs,  error  estimation  is  done  by  considering  the  lines  487.98  nm  and  480.60  nm  in 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
addition to 484.78 nm spectral line. It is seen that the plasma density decreases with time from 

1.96 × 1021 m-3 estimated at 50 µs to 1.23 × 1020 m-3 at 300 µs. With the decay in discharge current 

pulse, the energy input in the system decreases. Moreover, the decrease in current density (due to 

decaying discharge pulse) results in decrease of Lorentz force acting on the charged particles in 

the plasma. This reduces the compression of the plasma stream at the exit of the electrode assembly 

and hence, the plasma density decreases with delay time. 

3.2.2 Temporal evolution of electron excitation temperature 

The change in electron excitation temperature is also determined using the Boltzmann plot method 

as  described  above.  With  increase  in  time,  less  number  of  excited  levels  follow  a  Boltzmann 

distribution  as  the  density  decreases  and  energy  transfer  occurs  only  between  particles  having 

greater population.  

Fig. 8. Variation of electron excitation temperature with different delay time 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Initially, 7 lines were used for the plot but later some of the excited level populations deviates from 

the  equilibrium  state  and  the  excitation  temperature  is  obtained  from  those  levels  still  in 

equilibrium. The decrease in excitation temperature at different time window is shown in figure. 

8. The decrease of temperature reveals that there is less transfer of electron kinetic energy to the 

atoms and hence excitation from higher excited levels could not be observed towards later delay 

time. However, as observed in figure 8, there is an increase in excitation temperature at a delay of 

300  µs  and  this  is  reflected  as  increase  in  intensity  of  highly  populated  spectral  lines.  This  is 

probably due to energy transfer to the electrons during the decrease of plasma density. Similar 

observation was obtained in an earlier experiment in this device with TLP [29].  

4.  Conclusions 

Time-integrated spectroscopic measurements of plasma flow velocity, plasma density, and electron 

excitation temperature is presented for discharge voltage of 15 kV and 4 bar plenum pressure of 

gas injection valve for simultaneous triggering of the optical device and the PPS. The plasma flow 

velocity  is  found  to  be  22  +  5  km/s,  the  plasma  density  to  be  (5.29  ±  0.38)  ×1021  m-3  and  the 

excitation temperature to be 0.88 eV. This high-velocity plasma stream achieved in this device may 

be suitable for plasma fueling for fusion devices. The high density of plasma gives a high energy 

flux which can be utilized for PMI study. The excitation temperature is significant as it reveals the 

capability of effective kinetic energy transfer of the highly mobile electrons to heavy plasma species 

(ions and neutrals) through collisions. The evolution of plasma in different time window of its life 

is studied by adjusting the delay to the trigger of the spectrometer and the information collected 

from the spectrum shows a variation of plasma density, electron excitation temperature with respect 

to time. The plasma density has a gradual dcrease from 1.96 × 1021 m-3 estimated at 50 µs to 1.23 

× 1020 m-3 at 300 µs while electron excitation temperature has shown a rise towards the end of the 

22 

 
plasma  life.  This  change  is  attributed  to  energy  transfer  to  electrons  during  decrease  of  plasma 

density. This characterization of plasma stream in a pulsed plasma accelerator shows the presence 

of metastable species which is significant for material processing due to the high reactivity of the 

metastable species having a long lifetime.
