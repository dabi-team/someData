ABSTRACT
We present two events to study the driving mechanism of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)
waves that are not associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), by using high reso-
lution observations taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar
Dynamics Observatory. Observational results indicate that the observed EUV waves
were accompanied by ﬂares and coronal jets, but without CMEs that were regarded as
the driver of most EUV waves in previous studies. In the ﬁrst case, it is observed that
a coronal jet ejected along a transequatorial loop system at a plane-of-the-sky (POS)
speed of 335 ± 22 km s−1, in the meantime, an arc-shaped EUV wave appeared on the
eastern side of the loop system.
In addition, the EUV wave further interacted with
another interconnecting loop system and launched a fast propagating (QFP) magne-
tosonic wave along the loop system, which had a period of 200 s and a speed of 388 ±
65 km s−1, respectively. In the second case, we also observed a coronal jet ejected at a
POS speed of 282 ± 44 km s−1 along a transequatorial loop system and the generation
of bright EUV wave on the eastern side of the loop system. Based on the observational
results, we propose that the observed EUV waves on the eastern side of the transe-
quatorial loop systems are fast-mode magnetosonic waves, and they were driven by the
sudden lateral expansion of the transequatorial loop systems due to the direct impinge-
ment of the associated coronal jets, while the QFP wave in the ﬁst case formed due
to the dispersive evolution of the disturbance caused by the interaction between the
EUV wave and the interconnecting coronal loops. It is noted that EUV waves driven
by sudden loop expansions have shorter lifetimes than those driven by CMEs.

1. INTRODUCTION

Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves in the
solar atmosphere have been intensively stud-

ied for many years, mainly due to their impor-
tance for coronal heating and their applications
in coronal seismology (Alfv´en 1947; Nakariakov
et al. 1999; Nakariakov & Ofman 2001; Nakari-
akov & Verwichte 2005; Tomczyk et al. 2007;
McIntosh et al. 2011; Long et al. 2017).
In
the past several decades, various types of MHD
waves have been detected in the solar atmo-
sphere. For example, large-scale chromospheric
Moreton waves (e.g., Moreton 1960; Muhr et al.
2010; Shen & Liu 2012b; Krause et al. 2018) and
coronal Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) waves (e.g.,
Thompson et al. 1998; Liu et al. 2010; Chen &
Wu 2011; Zheng et al. 2013a; Xue et al. 2013;
Yang et al. 2013; Zong & Dai 2017), slow (e.g.,
Ofman et al. 1997) and fast modes of magne-
tosonic waves (e.g., Liu et al. 2011a; Shen &
Liu 2012a; Yuan et al. 2013; Shen et al. 2013b,
2018a,b), Alfv´en waves (e.g., Cirtain et al. 2007;
Jess et al. 2009), and various types of oscilla-
tions and waves in coronal loops and ﬁlaments
(e.g., Shen et al. 2014b,a; Pant et al. 2016; Li
et al. 2017a; Zhang et al. 2017, 2018; Kolotkov
et al. 2018). For more information on solar
MHD waves, one can refer to recent reviews on
this topic (e.g., Nakariakov & Verwichte 2005;
Liu & Ofman 2014; Warmuth 2015).

Large-scale EUV waves in corona have at-
tracted a lots of attentions since their discovery
(Moses et al. 1997; Thompson et al. 1998). In
the past twenty years, a large number of studies
have been performed to study the driving mech-
anism and the physical nature of EUV waves,
because interpretations about these basic prob-
It is unclear that the
lems are controversial.
observed EUV waves are driven by ﬂare pres-
sure pulses or coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
because of that EUV waves exhibit both wave
and non-wave characteristics. Since the launch
of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pes-
nell et al. 2012), the high temporal and high spa-
tial resolution multi-wavelengths observations
taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly

(AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the SDO
provides us an unprecedented opportunity to
clarify these long-standing but basic problems.
Based on AIA data, more and more observa-
tional studies tend to support that EUV waves
are fast-mode magneticsonic waves in nature
and they are driven by the associated CMEs
(e.g., Chen et al. 2002; Chen 2006; Chen & Wu
2011; Shen & Liu 2012b; Shen et al. 2017a; Long
et al. 2017; Xue et al. 2013). The wave nature of
EUV waves are conﬁrmed by a lots of wave phe-
nomena such as their fast-mode speed, reﬂec-
tion, transmission, and refraction eﬀects dur-
ing their interaction with other magnetic struc-
tures (e.g., Long et al. 2008; Gilbert et al. 2008;
Gopalswamy et al. 2009; Li et al. 2012; Olmedo
et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2013a; Yang et al. 2013).
In particularly, Chen (2006) performed a sta-
tistical study to investigate the driver of EUV
waves, and the authors found that EUV waves

dicates that EUV waves are driven by CMEs

this, there were a small number of reported
EUV waves that were not associated with CMEs
(e.g., Wills-Davey & Thompson 1999; Thomp-
son et al. 2000; Nitta et al. 2013).
In addi-
tion, a large number of theoretical works are
also performed to understand the physical na-
ture of EUV waves (e.g., Wu et al. 2001; Chen
et al. 2002; Ofman & Thompson 2002; Wang
et al. 2009; Mei et al. 2012; Downs et al. 2011,
2012; Vrˇsnak et al. 2016; Krause et al. 2018).

Some studies based on high temporal and high
spatial resolution data have revealed the de-
tailed evolution process and the relationship
between EUV waves and CMEs. By using
stereoscopic observations from two viewpoints
and three-dimensional geometrical modeling of
the CME and wave structures, Patsourakos &
Vourlidas (2009) found that the EUV wave oc-

cupies and aﬀects a much bigger volume than
the associated CME. Therefore, the authors
suggested that the observed EUV wave and the
associated CME were separated in space, and
the former is likely driven by the latter (see also,
Liu et al. 2011b). Cheng et al. (2012) identiﬁed
the separation of an EUV wave from the ex-
panding CME bubble in a powerful active region
GOES M2.5 ﬂare, which provided the direct ev-
idence for supporting the scenario that EUV
waves are driven by expanding CMEs. Very re-
cently, Shen et al. (2017a) also observed similar
separation process of a small-scale EUV wave
ahead of an expanding loop that was associ-
ated with a mini-ﬁlament eruption and a less
energetic GOES B1.9 ﬂare in the quiet-Sun re-
gion. Although no CME was associated with
this miniature eruption, the expanding loop sys-
tem can be regarded as the CME prototype in
the low corona. This observation and previous
studies on small-scale EUV waves together sug-
gested the similarity between small- and large-
scale EUV waves, and they also conﬁrmed that
EUV waves are driven by CMEs (Zheng et al.
2012b, 2013b).

Coronal jets are ubiquitous in the solar at-
mosphere, they are frequently observed in coro-
nal holes, active regions, and the quiet-Sun
regions (e.g., Chen et al. 2008; Yang et al.
2011; Young & Muglach 2014; Chen et al. 2012,
2015). Basically, coronal jets are thought to
be caused by magnetic reconnection between
emerging bipoles and their ambient open ﬁelds,
therefore, many studies reported that coronal
jets are tightly associated with magnetic ﬂux
emergences (e.g., Liu & Kurokawa 2004; Shi-
bata et al. 2007; Yokoyama & Shibata 1995;
Shen et al. 2011a; Li et al. 2015a; Liu et al.
2016). In addition, magnetic ﬂux cancellations
are also important for triggering coronal jets
(e.g., Jiang et al. 2007; Shen et al. 2012b, 2017b;
Panesar et al. 2016, 2017). Based on high reso-
lution observations, many studies revealed that

a large number of coronal jets are tightly in as-
sociation with the eruptions of mini-ﬁlaments,
and such kind of jets are dubbed as blowout
jets (e.g., Moore et al. 2010; Shen et al. 2012b,
2017b; Yang et al. 2012a,b; Li et al. 2015b; Ster-
ling et al. 2015; Hong et al. 2016; Sterling et al.
2016; Hong et al. 2017, 2013; Joshi et al. 2017;
Zhu et al. 2017; Li et al. 2017b; Joshi et al. 2018;
Li et al. 2018). We note particularly that some-
times a normal coronal jet can cause a single
CME in the ﬁeld-of-views (FOVs) of corona-
graphs, and the shape of the associated CME
often resemble the shape of the jet (e.g., Wang
& Sheeley 2002; Liu et al. 2005; Liu 2008). How-
ever, a blowout jet can cause a jet-like and
a bubble-like CMEs simultaneously,
in which
the jet-like CME is resulted from the reconnec-
tion between open magnetic ﬁelds and the ad-
jacent closed loops, while the bubble-like CME
is caused by the eruption of the mini-ﬁlament
conﬁned in the jet-base (Shen et al. 2012b). Re-
cently, it is interesting that some observational
studies reported that coronal jets are dynam-
ically related to large-scale EUV waves. How-
ever, most of the jet-related EUV waves are also
provided to be driven by the associated CMEs
(e.g., Zheng et al. 2012a, 2013a). In particularly,
Su et al. (2015) reported an EUV wave that was
in association with a coronal jet and a type II
radio burst, but the event did not accompanied
by a CME. The authors identiﬁed that the type
II radio burst was produced by the EUV wave,
and they further proposed that the generation
of the EUV was possibly caused by the expan-
sion of the newly formed magnetic loops during
the magnetic reconnection that produced the
observed coronal jet.

Generally speaking, any disturbance can
cause a wave in the coronal plasma. For mag-
netosonic waves, both the magnetic and the
plasma pressure act as the restoring forces.
Considering the complicated magnetic struc-
tures in the solar corona, the generation of fast-

mode EUV waves should have other drivers
besides CMEs. In this paper, we observed that
large-scale EUV waves can be launched by the
loops caused by
lateral expansion of coronal
the direct impingement of coronal jets. Two
similar events are presented in this paper to
illustrate this new driving mechanism of large-
scale EUV waves. Main observational results
are described in Section 2; interpretation of the

driving mechanism of the EUV waves are pre-
sented in Section 3; Conclusion and discussion
are given in the last section.

tively. The ﬂare was in association with a coro-
nal jet, but it did not cause any detectable CME
in coronagraphs. The AIA 171, 211, and 1600
˚A images are displayed in the top row of Fig-
ure 1 to show the pre-eruption magnetic con-
ditions.
It can be seen that three active re-
gions, AR11158, AR11159, and AR11161, were
involved in this event, in which AR11158 lo-
cated in the southern hemisphere, while the
other two located in the northern hemisphere.
As outlined by the white dotted curves, these
active regions were connected by two groups
of loop systems. The one connected AR11161
and AR11159, while the other is a transequato-
rial loop system that connected AR11158 and
AR11159.

The eruption of the jet is displayed in the bot-
tom two rows of Figure 1 with running ratio
images of AIA 171, 211, and 193 ˚A images, and
the dotted curves in each panel show the posi-
tion of the loop system that connected AR11159
and AR11161. Here, a running ratio image is
obtained by dividing an image by the one taken
at 24 s before, in which moving features can be
observed more clearly. It should be noted that
only two moments of the eruption are shown in
Figure 1, and one can see the online animation
for more detailed information. The coronal jet
erupted at about 04:29:00 UT from AR11158
and along the transequatorial loop system. It
is noted that the ejecting material of the jet
was trapped in the transequatorial loop sys-
tem. During the ejection, a bright wavefront
appeared on the eastern side of the transequa-
torial loop system at about 04:35:00 UT (see
Figure 1 (e) and (f)). The arc-shaped wavefront
propagated eastwardly at the ﬁrst, and then its
propagation direction changed to southeast. It
is noted that the curvature of the wavefront be-
come increasingly smaller.
In the meantime,
the brightness of the wavefront became increas-
ingly weaker, and it ﬁnally disappeared at about
04:45:00 UT. The lifetime of the EUV wave was

about 10 minutes, which is much shorter than
the typically hour-long lifetime of EUV waves
(Liu & Ofman 2014). Based on these obser-
vational results, we think that the generation of
the eastward EUV wave was possibly due to the
sudden eastward expansion of the transequato-
rial loop system caused by the sudden impinge-
ment of the coronal jet upon the loop system.

It is interesting that the northern section of
the wavefront interacted with the other loop
system that connected AR11161 and AR11159
at 04:38:38 UT, which caused obvious bright-
ening around the interaction position. A few
minutes later, multiple wavefronts appeared
and propagated along the loop system that
connected AR11159 and AR11161. The new
formed wavefronts can be best seen in the AIA
171 ˚A running ratio images (see the arrows
in Figure 1 (g)), and it could be regarded as
a quasi-periodic fast propagating (QFP) wave
(e.g., Liu et al. 2011a; Shen & Liu 2012a; Shen
et al. 2013b, 2018a,b).
In most of the previ-
ous studies, the generation of QFP waves were
found to be associated with the pulsations in
the accompanying ﬂares. Here, based on the
close temporal and spatial relationship between
the QFP wave and the EUV wave, it is obvious
that the generation of the multiple wavefronts
were associated with the interaction of the EUV
wave. Therefore, the generation of this QFP
wave was possibly due to the dispersive evolu-
tion of the disturbance caused by the interaction
(Liu et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2018b). Here, we
would like to point out that mode conversion
of solar EUV wavefronts have been reported
in recent observational and simulation stud-
ies, where fast-mode magnetosonic waves trans-
formed into slow-mode magnetosonic waves
during their interaction with other magnetic
structures (Chandra et al. 2016; Chen et al.
2016; Zong & Dai 2017).

The kinematics of the coronal jet and the
waves are studied with time-distance diagrams.

shown in Figure 2 (e), in which the red dotted lines indicate the propagating wavefronts. Panel (b) shown
the percentage intensity (red) and its detrended (blue) proﬁles along the white dashed line in panel (a). The
vertical arrows in panel (b) indicate the positions of the wavefronts. Panel (c) shows the wavelet power map
of the intensity proﬁle, and the global power is plotted on the right.

In a time-distance diagram, a moving feature
can be observed as an inclined bright stripe
whose slope represent the moving speed. To
obtain a time-distance diagram, one need to
ﬁrst obtain the one-dimensional intensity pro-
ﬁles along a speciﬁed path at diﬀerent times,
then a two-dimensional time-distance diagram
can be generated by stacking the obtained one-
dimensional intensity proﬁles in time. The top
row of Figure 2 shows the time-distance dia-
grams made from AIA 171, 211, and 193 ˚A run-
ning ratio images along the main axis of the
jet body. By applying a linear ﬁt to the bright
stripe, it is obtained that the average speed of
the jet is about 335 ± 22 km s−1. The time-
distance diagrams along the black dashed curve
as shown in Figure 1 (h) are plotted in the mid-
dle row of Figure 2, which show the kinemat-
ics of the EUV wavefront on the eastern side
of the transequatorial loop system.
It can be
seen that the wavefront show obvious deceler-

ation during its propagation. By ﬁtting the
stripes with a linear (quadratic) functions, it
can be obtained that the mean speed (decel-
eration) of the wavefront was about 466 ± 12
km s−1 (-0.65 ± 0.23 km s−2). The bottom row
of Figure 2 shows the time-distance diagrams
made along the white dashed curve as shown
in Figure 1 (a), which show the kinematics of
the QFP wave along the loop system that con-
nected AR11159 and AR11161. There are two
strong stripes can be clearly identiﬁed in the
time-distance diagrams, and the average speed
(deceleration) of the wavefronts was about 388
± 65 km s−1 (-0.38 ± 0.17 km s−2). It should
be pointed out that the speeds of the jets and
waves in the present paper are the POS speeds
on the sky plane, which are the lower limits of
their true three-dimensional values.

To further analyze the properties of the QFP
wave, the details of the white box region is
zoomed in in Figure 3 (a), from which one can

gating QFP wavefronts, and the ﬁrst ﬁve wave-
fronts are highlighted with red dotted lines. The

veals a strong period of about 200 ± 30 s in the
QFP wave (see Figure 3 (c)).

2.2. The Event on 2014 August 21

On 2014 August 21, a ﬂare occurred in NOAA
active region AR12148 in the northern hemi-
sphere of the Sun, which was associated a coro-
nal jet heading to the southern hemisphere, but
it did not cause any CME in coronagraphs. It
is unable to distinguish the class of the ﬂare,
because it was covered by a large GOES M3.4
ﬂare near the eastern limb of the solar disk. By
observing the start of the brightening in EUV
observations, it can be determined that the start
time of the ﬂare was at about 13:28:00 UT. The
pre-eruption magnetic condition is shown in the
top row of Figure 4 with AIA 171, 211, and
1600 ˚A images. The active regions AR12147
and AR12148 were involved in this event, and
they were connected by a group of transequato-
rial loop system. In addition, there is a closed
loop system connected the opposite magnetic
polarities in AR12147, and it was outlined by
the two dotted curves in Figure 4 (a).

Simultaneously with the start of the ﬂare, a
coronal jet ejected outward from the ﬂaring re-
gion in AR12148. The ejection of the coronal
jet was in the south direction and along the
transequatorial loops, which directly impinged
on the closed loop system in AR12147 at around
13:31:49 UT, and caused obvious brightening
around the interaction region and sudden move-
ment of the loop system in the southeast direc-
tion (see the middle row of Figure 4). After
the start of the interaction, a part of the eject-
ing plasma stopped around the interaction re-
gion, while the other part of the ejecting plasma
moved back along the ejection path. This pat-
tern of mass motion is similar to the failed ﬁl-
ament eruptions in which the erupting ﬁlament
plasma is prevented to erupt by the overlying
magnetic ﬁelds (e.g., Shen et al. 2011b, 2012a).
In addition, the closed loop system showed os-
cillation motion after the interaction, due to the

return motion of the loop system. More in-
terestingly, the interaction between the jet and
the closed loop system directly launched multi-
ple bright wavefronts in the eastern side of the
the closed loop system, which are highlighted
with red dashed curves in Figure 4 (g) and (i).
It is noted that the wavefronts can be divided
into two sets based on their propagation direc-
tions, in which one was in the east direction,
while the other was in the southeast direction.
Here, the eastward propagating wavefronts were
probably excited by the eastward expansion of
the transequatorial loops like the EUV wave ob-
served in the ﬁrst case, while the southeastward
wavefronts were possibly caused by the sudden
southeastward motion of the closed loop due to
the interaction of the coronal jet.

The kinematics of the coronal jet and the
wavefronts are studied with time-distance dia-
grams, and the results are shown in Figure 5.
The time-distance diagrams made from the AIA
171 and 304 ˚A running ratio images along the
main axis of the coronal jet are plotted in Fig-
ure 5 (a) and (b), respectively. It can be seen
that the jet started at about 13:28:00 UT, then
it ejected with a linear speed.
It is measured
that the speeds of the jet were about 326 and
238 km s−1 based on the AIA 171 and 304
˚A time-distance diagrams, respectively. There-
fore, the average speed of the jet is 282 ± 44
km s−1. When the coronal jet reached a dis-
tance of about 350 Mm from the eruption source
region, a part of the ejecting plasma stopped
there for about 30 minutes due to the impedi-
ment of the closed loop system in AR12147, and
the other part of the ejecting material started to
move back along the transequatorial loop sys-
tem. The time-distance diagrams plotted in
Figure 5 (c) and (d) are made along paths 1
and 2 as shown in Figure 4 (h) that are along
the propagation directions of the two sets of
wavefronts. Since the wavefronts are very weak,
in each time-distance diagram only one incline

linear ﬁt to the moving jet (top row) and the wave fronts (bottom row).

stripe can be clearly recognized. By applying
a linear ﬁt to the stripes, it is obtained that
the propagation speeds of the waves along paths
1 and 2 were about 320 and 360 km s−1, re-
spectively. The appearance and disappearance
times of the EUV waves were at about 13:32:47
UT and 13:39:59 UT, respectively. Therefore,
the lifetimes of the EUV waves were about only
7 minutes.

2.3. Magnetic Field Extrapolation

To better illustrate the magnetic topolo-
gies and the entire evolution processes of the
two events, we further extrapolated the three-
dimensional magnetic ﬁelds by using the po-
tential ﬁeld source surface (PFSS) software
available in the SolarSoftWare (SSW) package

(Schrijver & De Rosa 2003). The extrapolated
results of the events on 2011 February 15 and
on 2014 August 21 are shown in the left and
the right columns of Figure 6, respectively. It
should be pointed out that only some repre-
sentative magnetic ﬁeld lines are overlaid on
the AIA 171 ˚A images and the LOS magne-
tograms before the eruptions. For the event on
2011 February 15, the loop system connected
AR11161 and AR11158 is plotted in gray, the
transequatorial loop system is plotted in yellow,
and the yellow dashed arrow indicates the eject-
ing coronal jet. For the event on 2014 August
21, the transequatorial loop system is plotted in
gray, while the closed loop system in AR12147 is
plotted in yellow. In the same way, the ejecting

of-sight magnetograms (panels (b) and (d)) on 2011 February 15 and 2014 August 21, respectively.
In
the magnetograms, the white and black patches represent the positive and negative magnetic polarities,
respectively. The cyan and yellow curves are the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld lines based on the PFSS
software. The dashed pink arrows indicate the ejection direction of the coronal jets. The numbers of the
active regions are also plotted in the ﬁgure.

coronal jet is indicated by the purple dashed
arrow.
It can be seen that the extrapolated
magnetic ﬁeld lines do not exactly match the
actual coronal loops observed in the AIA 171
˚A images, which is due to the approximations
used in the PFSS extrapolation model in which
the magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be potential.
However, the extrapolated results do not aﬀect
the understanding of the large-scale magnetic
topologies and the connectivities.

3. INTERPRETATION

To better understand the driving mechanism
of the observed EUV and QFP waves in the
present study, we plot a cartoon in Figure 7 to
illustrate the detailed evolution processes of the
two events. It should be noted that only some
representative magnetic ﬁeld lines are plotted in
the ﬁgure, and the active regions are indicated
as letters. The pre-eruption magnetic conﬁgu-
ration of the event on 2011 February 15 is plot-
ted in Figure 7 (a), in which the letters P, N1,
and N2 represent the active regions AR11159,
AR11161, and AR11158, respectively. The ejec-
tion of the coronal jet from N2 can result in

for the events on 2011 February 15 and 2014 August 21, respectively. The red and yellow curves are some
representative ﬁeld lines connecting the polarities. The dashed gray curves in panels (b) and (e) indicate
the position of the undisturbed ﬁeld lines. The wave fronts are plotted as green and brown colors, and
the ejecting jets are also marked in the ﬁgure. The letters P, N1, and N2 in the top row represent the
active regions AR11159, AR11161, and AR11158, respectively. In the bottom row, P1 represents the active
region AR12148, while P2 and N indicate the positive and negative polarities of active regions AR12147,

the sudden lateral expansion or movement of
the transequatorial loop system in the east di-
rection. This will abruptly increase the mag-
netic and gas pressure forces perpendicular to
the transequatorial loop system, which there-
fore results in the generation of the observed
EUV wave (see Figure 7 (b)). The generation
of the QFP wave is shown in Figure 7 (c). Due
to the eastward propagation of the EUV wave,
it will interact with the loop system that con-
nects P and N1. This interaction will result
in a strong disturbance in the loop, which can
further evolve into multiple wavefronts due to
the dispersive evolution of the disturbance in
the inhomogeneous plasma medium (Shen et al.
2018b).

The pre-eruption magnetic conﬁguration of
the event on 2014 August 21 is plotted in Fig-

ure 7 (d), in which the letters P1, P2, and N rep-
resent the active region AR12148, and the posi-
tive and negative polarities of AR12147, respec-
tively. Here, the generation of the EUV wave on
the eastern side of the transequatorial loop sys-
tem that connects P1 and N is the same with
the one observed in the event on 2011 February
15 (see Figure 7 (e) and (f)), while the genera-
tion of the EUV wave in the southeast direction
is possibly caused by the sudden southeastward
motion of the closed loop system that connects
N and P2, due to the impingement of the coro-
nal jet.

found that the EUV waves were in association
with the violent eruption of coronal jets along
transequatorial loops.

For the event on 2011 February 15, the coro-
nal jet ejected at a speed of about 335 ± 22
km s−1 along the transequatorial loop system
that connected AR11158 and AR11159. Dur-
ing the ejecting of the coronal jet, a bright arc-
shaped EUV wave appeared on the eastern side
of the transequatorial loop system, which prop-
agated outward in the east direction at an av-
erage speed (deceleration) of about 466 ± 12
km s−1 (-0.65 ± 0.23 km s−2). During the prop-
agation of the EUV wave, the northern sec-
tion of the EUV wavefront interacted with an
other loop system that connected AR11159 and
AR11161. The interaction between the wave
and the loop system directly caused the genera-
tion of a QFP wave along the loop system. It is
measured that the period of the QFP wave was
about 200 s, while the average speed (decelera-
tion) was about 388 ± 65 km s−1 (-0.38 ± 0.17
km s−2).

For the event on 2014 August 21, it is observed
that a coronal jet ejected from AR12148 at an
average speed of about 282 ± 44 km s−1. The
ejection of the coronal jet was along the transe-
quatorial loop system that connected AR12147
and AR12148. The jet directly impinged on the
closed loop system in AR12147, which caused
the sudden southeastward movement of the loop
system. After the interaction, the closed loop
system showed obvious oscillation motion.

the meantime, EUV wavefronts are simultane-

transequatorial
that the speeds of the EUV waves on the east-
ern side of the transequatorial loop system and
the southeast direction of the closed loop sys-
tem were about 360 and 320 km s−1, respec-
tively. The EUV waves observed in the ﬁrst

event showed obvious deceleration during their
propagation, but those in the second case did
not. In addition, the propagation speeds of the
observed EUV waves in the two events are all
signiﬁcantly higher than the sound speed (150
– 210 km s−1; Liu & Ofman 2014) and fall
in the range of fast-mode speed (230 – 1500
km s−1; Wills-Davey et al. 2007) in the quiet-
Sun corona. In addition, due to the projection
eﬀect the true wave speed should be larger than
those we obtained from the imaging observa-
tions. Therefore, these EUV waves should be
regarded as fast-mode magnetosonic waves in
nature.

Previous statistical studies have revealed that
EUV waves are excited by CMEs rather that
ﬂare pressure pulses (e.g., Chen et al. 2002;
Chen 2006; Chen & Wu 2011; Shen & Liu
2012b; Shen et al. 2017a; Long et al. 2017; Xue
et al. 2013). However, the eruptions studied
in the present paper did not cause any CME
in coronagraphs, which suggests that the ob-
served EUV waves were driven by other physi-
cal processes rather than CMEs. Based on the
observational results, we propose that the ob-
served EUV waves on the eastern side of the
transequatorial loop systems in the present two
cases were driven by the sudden lateral expan-
sion of the loop systems due to the impingement
of the associated coronal jets. In addition, the
observed QFP waves along the loop system that
connected AR11159 and AR11161 in the ﬁrst
event was formed by the dispersive evolution
of the disturbance caused by the interaction be-
tween the EUV wave and the loop system (Shen
et al. 2018b).

In the driving mechanism of EUV waves pro-
posed in the present paper, the sudden change
of magnetic and plasma pressures perpendicular
to the transequatorial loop systems may need to
be fast enough to drive EUV waves. The fast
moving coronal jets, that possess high kinetic
energy, provide enough momentum to drive the

lateral expansion of the loop systems and there-
fore increase the magnetic and plasma pres-
sures. The lifetimes of the EUV waves in the
present two events were all less than 10 minutes,
which are much shorter than the typically hour-
long lifetime of EUV waves (Liu & Ofman 2014).
This is possibly because of that the driven times
of the EUV waves due to sudden lateral ex-
pansion of the transequatorial loop systems are
much shorter than those driven by large-scale
CMEs. Obviously, CMEs can provide a con-
tinuous driving force for EUV waves during the
initial stage, whereas the lateral expansion of
loops caused by coronal jets can only drive EUV
waves within a short time interval. Since the
ejection of coronal jets are transient phenom-
ena, the expanded loop systems will return to
their initial equilibrium positions when the ejec-
tion of the coronal jets ﬁnished. Therefore, the
short lifetimes of the observed EUV waves also
support the scenario that the observed EUV
waves were driven by the sudden lateral expan-
sion of the transequatorial loop systems due to
the interaction of coronal jets. Su et al. (2015)
also reported an EUV wave that was excited
by the expansion motion of coronal loops. We
noted that the lifetime of the EUV wave studied
in Su et al. (2015) was about 6 minutes, which
is in agreement with our result that EUV waves
driven by loop expansions should have a shorter
lifetimes than those driven by CMEs.

The formation mechanisms of the loop expan-
sions in Su et al. (2015) and the present cases

are totally diﬀerent. In Su et al. (2015) the loop
expansion was caused by the expansion of the
newly formed reconnected loops resembling of
the mechanism of a slingshot in the eruption of
coronal jets. In the present study, the expansion
of the loop systems were directly cased by the
impingement of fast coronal jets. Although the
diﬀerent formation mechanisms of the coronal
loop expansion, the driving mechanism of the
EUV waves in these cases should be similar to
each other; namely, all of them were driven by
the fast expanding coronal loops. In the future,
more similar observational and theoretical stud-
ies are required to test the scenario proposed in
the present paper.
