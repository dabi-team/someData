ABSTRACT   

Since the start of full science operations from 2004, the Submillimeter Array has been implementing plans to expand IF 
bandwidths and upgrade receivers and cryostats. Metal mesh low-pass filters were designed to block infrared (IR) radiation 
to reduce the thermal load on the cryostats. Filters were fabricated on a quartz wafer through photolithography and coated 
with anti-reflection (AR) material. The filters were tested from 200 to 400 GHz to verify their passband performances. The 
measurement results were found to be in good agreement with EM simulation results. They were tested in the far-infrared 
(FIR)  frequency range  to  verify  out-of-band  rejection.  The  IR  reflectivity  was  found  to be  approximately  70%, which 
corresponded to the percentage of the area blocked by metal.

INTRODUCTION 

Submillimeter  Array  (SMA)  has  been  in  operation  since  its  dedication  in  2004  and  is  on  track  to  expand  its  IF 
bandwidths (wideband Submillimeter Array, wSMA) [1] and upgrade receivers and cryostats. In the new cryostat, the plan 
is to install low-pass infrared (IR) filters on the 65 K radiation shield to reduce the thermal load. Although a plain quartz 
wafer  coatings  can  also  be  used  to  absorb  IR  [2],  However,  limited  by  thermal  conduction  between  the  filter  and  the 
radiation shield, the filter may heat up and re-emit at an elevated temperature to the 4 K stage. To minimize these effects, 
a low-pass filter that can reflect IR radiation is preferred. Such thermal filters have been used with large aperture detector 
arrays to minimize background radiation [3]. 

Ade et al. [4] provided a comprehensive review of metal mesh filters. Metal mesh filters are characterized as inductive, 
capacitive,  or  resonant  grids,  and  provide  high-pass,  low-pass,  and  bandpass  properties,  respectively.  We  designed  a 
capacitive metal mesh filter to block IR radiation of approximately 10 µm or 30 THz, where the maximum intensity of 
radiation emitted by a blackbody at 300 K is. In the following sections, the design, fabrication, and testing of the IR filter 
are described. 

II. 

IR FILTER DESIGN 

The  design  began  with  a  layer  of  capacitive  metal  mesh.  Because  of  the  periodicity  of  the  grid,  a  unit  cell  with 
symmetric walls [5] was used during 3D EM simulations. In a low-pass grid, the grid period corresponds to a frequency 
where cutoff occurs. A grid period of 40 µm, corresponding to a cutoff frequency of approximately 7.5 THz, was chosen 
initially. However, the bandpass loss around 500 GHz was close to 0.4 dB. Another trial is to use a grid period of 12 µm 
with a cutoff frequency of approximately 25 THz. However, to achieve a blocking area percentage of more than 70%, the 
gap between gold patches would be less than 2 µm, which may not be easy for the lift-off process used in fabrication. 
Therefore,  a  grid  period  of  20  µm  with  gaps  of  3  µm  was  adopted  considering  the  in-band  transmission,  out-of-band 
rejection, and fabrication. Fig. 1 shows the model of a unit cell with the capacitive grid in the 3D EM simulator HFSS [6]; 
the simulated responses are shown in Fig. 2. The cutoff frequency was approximately 15 THz, where the grid period is 
close to the free-space wavelength. Diffraction occurred above 15 THz, when the wavelength was less than the grid period.

also shown (green line: transmission, brown line: reflection). 

Modeling provides us with insights into the characteristics of the metal mesh and is useful for multilayer filter design. 
An equivalent circuit with a shunt capacitor, as shown in Fig. 3, was used to model the capacitive grid. The transmission 
is expressed as

normalized to the free-space wave impedance 0 of 377 Ω. By fitting the transmission at lower frequencies, the capacitance 
was estimated to be approximately 3.1 × 10−14 F. A modified equivalent circuit was suggested [7] to include an inductor 
and a resistor to account for self-resonance and loss. For the modified equivalent circuit, the transmission T and reflection 
 are expressed as

A slab of a quartz substrate was added to the model, along with two quarter-wavelength AR coatings at the top and 
bottom, as shown in Fig. 4. Crystalline quartz with a dielectric constant of 4.45 [8] was chosen as the substrate. Its initial 
thickness was 860 µm, which corresponded to approximately two wavelengths at 345 GHz. Low-density polyethylene 
(LDPE), which has a refractive index of approximately 1.52 [8], was used as the AR material. Transmission was optimized 
between 210 and 360 GHz by varying the thicknesses of the quartz wafer and AR coatings. The optimal parameters of the 
IR filter are listed in Table I. The simulated spectral responses are shown in Fig. 5.

FABRICATION 

A 4" z-cut both side polished quartz wafer was used to fabricate the filter. The thickness of the filter was specified to 
be  1.078  mm  ±  25 µm.  An  approximately  200-nm-thick  gold  layer  was  deposited  via  e-beam  evaporation  with  a  thin 
(approximately 20 nm) layer of Ti underneath. The lift-off process was followed to form the capacitive grid. Few images 
taken after the processing are shown in Fig. 6. 

After the capacitive grid was processed, LDPE films were attached on both sides of the filter as AR coating. The 
LDPE films were thermally bonded [2] to the quartz wafer at 0.25 psi in an oven at 180 °C for 6 hours. Because the LDPE 
films in our inventory are of only a few thicknesses, two films were combined to produce a single-layer coating. The final 
thickness of the LDPE film was 186 µm on the grid side and  153 µm on the other side; both these values were lower than 
the design values. Images of the IR filter with the AR coatings are shown in Fig. 7.

The IR filter was tested in lab at room temperature to measure the transmission and reflection within the passband. 
Far-infrared (FIR) Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS) was also used to verify the out-of-band behavior up to 30 THz.

LAB TESTING 

A. In-Band Test 

A scalar system was set up to measure the passband properties of the IR filter from 200 to 400 GHz. The transmission 
measurement setup is shown in Fig. 8. Tone signals up to 20 GHz were provided with a signal generator and then frequency 
multiplied. The test tone was transmitted by a horn and propagated using two lenses that formed a Gaussian beam telescope 
[9] to the receiving horn. The IR filter was placed around the beam waist between the two lenses. The received power was 
measured  using  a  millimeter-wave  power  meter.  Measurements  were  performed  with  and  without  the  IR  filter.  A 
comparison of the two sets of results  determines the transmission of the IR filter, as shown in Fig. 9. 

Reflection measurements were also performed using the setup shown in Fig. 10. The reflected power was measured 
using either the IR filter or a reference plate. A quartz wafer deposited with a 200-nm-thick gold layer was used as the 
reference plate. The reflection of the IR filter was derived and the results are shown in Fig. 11. The reflection pattern 
shifted to higher frequencies compared with that obtained in the 3D EM simulations. This was attributable to the thinner 
AR coatings used. Another filter with slightly thicker AR coatings (196 µm on the grid side, and 159 µm on the other side) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was tested using a quasi-optical vector network analyzer (QO-VNA) [10]. The measurement results obtained with this 
filter were in better agreement with the simulation results, as seen in Fig. 11. 

The improved method of intersecting lines [11] was used to measure the insertion loss of the mesh filter. The mesh 
filter was placed in front of the window of an SMA receiver operating at LO 264 GHz. The difference in intercept was 3.9 
(±0.5) K, corresponding to a loss of approximately 1.2% (±0.2%) at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 12.

reflection between components. The data were shifted to higher frequencies compared with the 3D EM simulations (solid

B. FTS Testing 

FIR FTS was used to measure the out-of-band properties of the IR filter. The transmissions of a quartz wafer and the 
IR filter were measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 13. The measurements were performed in two frequency ranges 
(one up to 10 THz, and the other up to 30 THz). The results show that the IR filter blocked FIR radiation above 5 THz,  
where  the  quartz  wafer  still  has  some  transmission.  The  reflection  measurements  show  that  the  IR  filter  achieved 
approximately 70% reflectivity in the FIR frequency range; this value corresponds to the percentage of area blocked by 
the capacitive grid (172/202 = 72%), as shown in Fig. 14. Reflectivity of the quartz wafer was approximately 20%. 

Given the reflectivity of the IR filter and quartz wafer, we can estimate the radiation heat transfer between the quartz 
vacuum window and the IR filter by using the radiation network method [12]. Based on Equation (4) and the parameters 
listed in Table II, the radiation heat transfer from the vacuum window to the IR filter is estimated to be approximately 1.3 
W, lower than 2.5 W when a plain quartz wafer is in place.

SUMMARY 

We designed, fabricated, and tested a metal mesh IR filter for wSMA to reduce the thermal load on cryostats. The in-
band  transmission  and  reflection  measurement  results  were  in  good  agreement  with  the  EM  simulations.  FTS 
measurements indicated that the IR filter achieved a 70% reflectivity in the FIR frequency range, which corresponded to 
the percentage of area blocked by the capacitive grid.
