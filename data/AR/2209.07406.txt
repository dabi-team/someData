ABSTRACT

Solar ﬂare prediction is a central problem in space weather forecasting and has captivated the
attention of a wide spectrum of researchers due to recent advances in both remote sensing as
well as machine learning and deep learning approaches. The experimental ﬁndings based on
both machine and deep learning models reveal signiﬁcant performance improvements for task
speciﬁc datasets. Along with building models, the practice of deploying such models to production
environments under operational settings is a more complex and often time-consuming process
which is often not addressed directly in research settings. We present a set of new heuristic
approaches to train and deploy an operational solar ﬂare prediction system for ≥M1.0-class ﬂares
with two prediction modes: full-disk and active region-based. In full-disk mode, predictions are
performed on full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms using deep learning models whereas in active
region-based models, predictions are issued for each active region individually using multivariate
time series data instances. The outputs from individual active region forecasts and full-disk
predictors are combined to a ﬁnal full-disk prediction result with a meta-model. We utilized an
equal weighted average ensemble of two base learners’ ﬂare probabilities as our baseline meta
learner and improved the capabilities of our two base learners by training a logistic regression
model. The major ﬁndings of this study are: (i) We successfully coupled two heterogeneous ﬂare
prediction models trained with different datasets and model architecture to predict a full-disk
ﬂare probability for next 24 hours, (ii) Our proposed ensembling model, i.e., logistic regression,
improves on the predictive performance of two base learners and the baseline meta learner
measured in terms of two widely used metrics True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Heidke Skill Score
(HSS), and (iii) Our result analysis suggests that the logistic regression-based ensemble (Meta-
FP) improves on the full-disk model (base learner) by ∼9% in terms TSS and ∼10% in terms of
HSS. Similarly, it improves on the AR-based model (base learner) by ∼17% and ∼20% in terms
of TSS and HSS respectively. Finally, when compared to the baseline meta model, it improves on
TSS by ∼10% and HSS by ∼15%.

Coupling Full-disk and Active Region-based Flare Prediction

1 INTRODUCTION

A solar ﬂare is an intense burst of electromagnetic radiation through magnetic reconnection and plasma
instability coming from the release of magnetic energy associated with active regions (AR) and they
transpire as a sudden brightening of light on the Sun’s corona Toriumi and Wang (2019). Coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), which are often associated with solar ﬂares, have comparable energies, and can release
large amounts of mass resulting into major geomagnetic storms which creates intense currents in the
Earth’s magnetosphere, changes in the radiation belts, and in the ionosphere Feng et al. (2020). When
particles emitted by the Sun are accelerated during a ﬂare or by a CME event and reach the Earth along
interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld lines, Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are produced N´u˜nez and Paul-Pena
(2020). Primarily, solar ﬂares are considered to be the central phenomena in space weather forecasting, and
this paper discusses on the predictive models for solar ﬂares. Solar ﬂares can induce intense variation in
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, causing potential disruptions to many stakeholders such as the electricity supply
chain, airlines industry, astronauts in space, and communication systems including satellites and radio.
Forecasting solar ﬂares has been a major challenge in heliophysics owing to the yet unsolved fundamental
cause of this phenomenon which makes it difﬁcult to predict the exact occurrence of a ﬂare, especially
for relatively large ones. However, recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning methods
have demonstrated great experimental success and catalyzed the efforts in prediction of solar ﬂares, which
captivated the interest of many interdisciplinary researchers Li et al. (2020); Nishizuka et al. (2018); Huang
et al. (2018). Developing predictive models for ﬂare prediction is limited to the nature, quantity, and quality
of ﬂaring instances as well as the inductive bias of learning algorithms when predicting such ﬂare events.
As a consequence of the intrinsic limitations pre-incorporated by the predictive models during problem
formulation or model selection or utilizing different data products, an individual ﬂare prediction model is
limited in performance. Although all the models built so far for ﬂare forecasting have limitations, different
comprehensions and insights on data distribution are still valuable for making the ﬁnal decision in an
operational ﬂare forecasting system. Therefore, it is intuitive to use as many pieces of information that
can be gathered from different sets of models such as machine learning or deep learning models obtained
from different data modalities in terms of active region magnetogram patches, full-disk magnetograms or
magnetogram’s metadata (magnetic ﬁeld parameters) to issue a reduced risk prediction.

In active region-based models, predictions are issued for certain areas on the Sun with greatly enhanced
magnetic ﬂux, known as active regions. Active regions have lifetimes of days to month, feature strong and
entangled magnetic ﬁelds and are the exclusive locations of strong ﬂares and major eruptions, including fast
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This said, only a slim minority (10% or less) of active regions appearing
in a given solar cycle provide ﬂares of GOES class ≥M1.0 and fast CMEs (e.g., Georgoulis et al. (2019);
Toriumi and Wang (2019)). These regions can host solar eruptions. To employ active region-based models
in an operational setting, individual active region forecasts are aggregated by computing the probability of
ﬂare from at least one active region assuming conditional independence and then these ﬂare probabilities
are used to compute a full-disk ﬂare occurrence probability. However, for an operational system, working
with near-real time data and issuing near-real time predictions, active region-based models relying on
magnetic ﬁeld observations possess a limited forecasting ability as they restrict the training datasets within
central regions (±70◦) due to severe projection effects Hoeksema et al. (2014). Besides the unreliable
measurements, foreshortening closer to the solar limbs greatly impacts the operational use of magnetic
ﬁeld data. This leads to reduction in signiﬁcant information required to make reliable ﬂare predictions in
active regions. Moreover, predictions from active region-based models often rely on sampled subset of
statistical features that were used to train the model and therefore when examining forecasts from different

Preprint

subsets of features, it is common to observe that for the similar condition of the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld, they can give varying values for prediction probabilities of a particular ﬂare to happen.

To account for the limitations of active region-based ﬂare predictors, full-disk prediction models provide
a complementary approach for operational ﬂare forecasting systems Pandey et al. (2021). The full-disk
model utilize the compressed line-of-sight magnetograms and these magnetograms are used for shape
based parameters (such as size, directionality, borders of sunspots) and do not possess the magnetic ﬁeld
properties as in the magnetogram rasters which is advantageous over the active region-based models where
individual active region magnetic ﬁeld parameters used near the limb are more prone to projection effects.
The signiﬁcant part of an operational ﬂare forecasting model is to issue a reliable forecast for which we use
a heterogeneous ensemble that combines two different base learners. In addition, to address the operational
aspect of our system, we consider two essential system-level criteria: (i) near-real-time availability of
input data is ensured given that both of our base learners are trained with line-of-sight magnetograms and
physical parameters obtained from a line-of-sight magnetograms and vector magnetograms available at a
cadence of 12 minutes, and (ii) our proposed system is scalable in a sense that it allows the ﬂexibility of
adding a new base learner (if needed in the future) in the system as it will be one step away from retraining
the ensemble and deploying it back to our forecasting system.

In this work, to issue more reliable forecasts in an operational settings, we propose a heuristic ensemble
approach which consolidates the predictive results of the two aforementioned prediction modalities into
one combined solar ﬂare forecast. The major contributions of this paper are following: we present a
methodology on how to train and validate an ensemble ﬂare prediction model in regard to its operations-
ready characteristics. The ensemble combines the predictions from two base learners: (i) a deep learning-
based full-disk ﬂare predictor using SDO/HMI images and (ii) a set of probabilistic predictions from a time
series classiﬁer utilizing active region patches’ magnetic ﬁeld metadata in the form of multivariate time
series. For both base learners, we use the similar time-segmented tri-monthly data partitioning strategy
Pandey et al. (2021) to perform 3-fold cross-validation experiments. Finally, we use the probability scores
of these two base learners obtained from the validation and test partitions to train and validate our proposed
meta-learner which converges to a more robust full-disk ﬂare predictor.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we present the related work on ensemble
solar ﬂare forecasting models. In Sec. 3, we provide a detailed workﬂow of our methodology. In Sec. 4, we
present our detailed experimental evaluation with settings and results. In Sec. 5 we present a discussion on
the ensembles created and, lastly, in Sec. 6, we present our conclusions and discuss future work.

2 RELATED WORKS

The idea of automatically extracting forecast patterns from the large volume of intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld
data on the photosphere of the sun using machine learning methods has begun from the early 1990’s Aso
et al. (1994). Since then, with the rapid development in machine learning and deep learning approaches, a
number of research groups Nishizuka et al. (2018); Huang et al. (2018); Li et al. (2020), Nishizuka et al.
(2021), and references therein present their efforts in applying such methods to build ﬂare forecasting
models.

In recent years, Li et al. (2020); Huang et al. (2018) used a deep learning model based on CNN
with different data products for ﬂare forecasting. Although they show an impressive performance on ﬂare
classiﬁcation, they limit the scope of the prediction to smaller areas by using active region-based data within
±30◦ to 45◦ of the central meridian of the Sun which may counter their performance for true operational

forecasting. In addition, Florios et al. (2018) calculated physical features of ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs
obtained from the SDO/HMI’s near-real-time vector magnetogram data and trained SVMs, multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs), and decision tree algorithms to predict occurrences of ≥M1.0-class and ≥C1.0-class
ﬂares with a forecast horizon of 24 hours. In Benvenuto et al. (2018), a combination of supervised lasso
regression for identifying the signiﬁcant features and then an unsupervised fuzzy clustering is used for the
classiﬁcation of ≥M1.0-class and ≥C1.0-class ﬂares. Furthermore, Park et al. (2018); Pandey et al. (2021)
uses full-disk magnetograms data as a point in time observation with CNN based deep learning models,
which have limitations in capturing the evolution of solar ﬂares and they do not account for ﬂares that are
on the eastern-limb of the Sun. Overall, some methods are appropriate for constructing prediction models
for the temporal data variation, whereas others are beneﬁcial for spatial data variation, which demands a
need for a coupled hybrid model that can exploit the gains of multiple models.

Jonas et al. (2018) designed a time series data set using photospheric and coronal images from HMI/SDO
and AIA/SDO instruments to forecast ≥M1.0-class ﬂares within the next 24 h. They utilize random
partitioning of datasets into 80% and 20% for training and testing the linear classiﬁer. Apart from devising
ﬂare forecasting as a binary classiﬁcation task, Abduallah et al. (2021) formulates it as a multiclass
classiﬁcation problem to classify B-, C-, M- and X-class ﬂares by utilizing the physical parameters within
±70◦ provided by the SHARP series of HMI/SDO. Finally, the author uses majority voting as an ensemble
to issue a ﬁnal ﬂare forecast from three different models trained on the same data. The training procedure
in their work uses random 10-fold cross-validation.

Instead of using a single prediction model, ensembles use a set of predictions and combine these results
to improve on a single-model prediction. In addition, an ensemble can be created with a single model
itself by perturbing its initial conditions or parameter settings to produce multiple results and then combine
those results into one called homogeneous ensembles Breiman (1996); Freund and Schapire (1996). Flare
forecasting problems also make use of decision tree-based homogeneous ensembles. Liu et al. (2017a)
apply random forest (RF) Breiman (2001) – a meta-algorithm that ﬁts a number of decision tree classiﬁers
on different sub-samples of a dataset and utilizes averaging to improve the model’s performance. Similarly,
Nishizuka et al. (2017) employed an extremely randomized tree (ERT) classiﬁer Geurts et al. (2006) by
ﬁtting several decision-tree classiﬁers on a random subset of features with a randomly deﬁned threshold to
prevent overﬁtting. While RF and ERT are meta-algorithms based on the bagging technique, XGBoost
Chen and Guestrin (2016) follows boosting approach to ensemble construction and focuses on incorrect
predictions. It varies from Random Forest such that XGBoost always prioritizes functional space while
reducing the cost of a model, whereas Random Forest tries to prioritize hyperparameters when optimizing
the model. McGuire et al. (2019) uses XGBoost for window-based feature extraction from time series of
physical parameters to classify solar ﬂares. However the aforementioned ensembles can optimize on one
set of data modality.

Besides decision trees, different models trained with different algorithms but with same data modalities
can also be used in an ensemble as in Liu et al. (2017b). However, they only included magnetograms with
ARs within ±30◦ of the central meridian of the Sun for ≥C1.0-class ﬂares and then designed a multimodel
integrated learner (MIM) by ﬁtting several distinct base learners, such as neural networks, naive classiﬁers,
and SVMs. Finally, the outputs of base learners were combined by a genetic algorithm. Similar efforts for
≥C1.0-class ﬂares forecasting can be seen in Campi et al. (2019) where ARs extracted from SDO/HMI
images from 2012 September 14 and 2016 April 30 are used and two-third of the instances are randomly
selected for training and one-third for testing their models. Furthermore, in Domijan et al. (2019) they
study the predictive capabilities of magnetic-feature properties located within ±45◦ from the solar central

meridian and detected using Solar Monitor Active Region Tracker Higgins et al. (2011) in Michelson
Doppler Imager (MDI) magnetograms and analyze the features to predict ≥C1.0-class ﬂares within the 24
hours following the observation. In this data-driven era of predictive models, complex models can bring on
higher accuracy, but also ensembles allow many weak models to be combined to produce a meta model
that can compete with the state-of-the-art research efforts Murray (2018).

In recent years, the usage of ensembles have become a more popular research topic in space weather
forecasting. Guerra et al. (2015) created a multi-model ensemble from four base learners for ≥M1.0-class
ﬂare prediction, ﬁnding an improved forecast output compared to any one single model. Similarly, Schunk
et al. (2016) built an ionosphere-thermosphere-electrodynamics multimodel ensemble prediction system
based on seven physics-based data assimilation models. Furthermore, in Guerra et al. (2020), full-disk
probabilistic forecasts from six operational forecasting methods are converted to an ensemble for ≥M1.0-
class ﬂares by a linear classiﬁer and create a total of 28 ensembles to show the improvement of such
a technique over individual model forecasts. Although, ensemble methods are increasingly being used
by space weather researchers, much of this research has yet to be implemented into operations, where
transitioning comes with issues of model compatibility.

It is worth noting that using a ﬂare forecasting model in operational settings, generally it is preferred to use
more simplistic robust methods. Diving into meteorology’s scenario, The NASA Community Coordinated
Modeling Center’s (CCMC) CME Scoreboard (1) and solar ﬂare Scoreboard (2) provide an weighted and
equi-weight average of multiple forecast scores. Using an equal weighted average of multiple forecasts
can be used as a reliable ﬁrst guess over a more complex model runs or deciding on one speciﬁc forecast
out of several in operations Murray (2018), however, an ensemble derived from a linear combination of
multiple models can add to the decision making capabilities on one ﬁnal forecast leveraging the advantage
of simplicity and hence making it more reliable to trust its decision while in operation.

To evaluate a ﬂare forecasting system in an operational scenario, Cinto et al. (2020) provides a set of
criteria that are worth considering and can be used to distinguish a non-operationally evaluated system:
(i) model evaluation without truly unseen data, (ii) using active region (AR) magnetograms only near the
center of the solar disk, (iii) only using AR magnetograms linked to ≥C1.0-class ﬂares, and (iv) using
insufﬁcient data instances. The author argues that the non-operationally evaluated system are evaluated
under certain bias and that does not make them wrong, however, evaluating under such speciﬁc conditions
might impair their predictive capabilities in real operational settings. In addition to these guidelines, it is
essential to note that, most of the studies, create a cross-validation dataset by randomizing the process
of data splitting. While such data splitting leads to higher experimental accuracy scores, it often fails to
deliver similarly real-time performance as discussed in Ahmadzadeh et al. (2021). We build our models
that meet the standard of the aforementioned criteria as they can address the near-limb events with the
full-disk base learner, they are trained and tested with a time-segmented partitioning of data from solar
cycle 24, and we evaluate our models using data instances that were not presented to the models during
training to address the operational settings of ﬂare forecasting.

In this work, we combine the prediction probabilities of two types of base learners by the means of
a linear classiﬁer based on logistic regression. Our ﬁrst base learner, which is a deep learning based
model which focuses on spatial variation of a full-disk magnetogram. Similarly, our second base learner
is a heuristic-based aggregation model which outputs full disk probability using the results from active

region-based multivariate time series classiﬁers. We train and validate an operations-ready ensemble ﬂare
prediction model which optimizes the predictive performance of both our base learners and provides a
better conﬁdence while issuing a ﬂare forecast.

3 METHODOLOGY

Ensemble approaches integrate multiple forecasts into a single prediction by combining the predictions
from multiple base learners. A simplistic way of integrating the forecasts is to use an equal weighting
for each forecast and combine to improve on a single-model prediction which we use as our baseline
meta-model. As mentioned earlier, we attempt to combine the predictions of two base learners: (i) a deep
learning-based full-disk ﬂare predictor using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument onboard
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) images and (ii) a multivariate time series classiﬁer utilizing magnetic
ﬁeld metadata to issue one combined full-disk ﬂare forecast.

3.1 Base Learners

3.1.1 Time-Series Forest

Our active region-based prediction model is a multivariate Time Series Forest (TSF), trained with Space
Weather Analytics benchmark dataset for solar ﬂare prediction (SWAN-SF) Angryk et al. (2020a,b) to
predict the occurrence of ≥M1.0-class ﬂares within the next 24 hours by using an observation window
of 12 hours. The SWAN-SF is an open source multivariate time series (MVTS) dataset that provides
time series instances for a collection of space weather related physical parameters within ±70◦ primarily
calculated for each active regions from solar photospheric magnetograms. The TSF model is trained by
utilizing six magnetic-ﬁeld parameters: (i) TOTUSJH (Total unsigned current helicity), (ii) TOTPOT
(Total photospheric magnetic free energy density), (iii) TOTUSJZ (Total unsigned vertical current), (iv)
ABSNJZH (Absolute value of the net current helicity), (v) SAVNCPP (Sum of the modulus of the net
current per polarity), and (vi) USFLUX (Total unsigned ﬂux) from the suggested list of 13 parameters in
Bobra and Couvidat (2015) as these are available in near-real time, which is a necessity for an operational
system. The model outputs the ﬂaring probability for an individual active region and the implementation of
this model is based on Ji et al. (2020).

3.1.2 Deep Learning Model

We trained an AlexNet-based Krizhevsky et al. (2012) Convolutional Neural Network to perform full-
disk binary ﬂare prediction for ≥M1.0-class ﬂares. Similar to the active region-based counterparts, the
full-disk model assumes a 24 hour prediction window, but uses a single image (point-in-time observation)
to perform the predictions. For this task, we collected compressed 8-bit images created from full-disk
line-of-sight magnetograms provided by HMI/SDO. We collected two compressed magnetogram images
per day (bi-daily image samples) at 00:00 UT and 12:00 UT from December 2010 to December 2018
using Helioviewer API Muller et al. (2009) and labeled them based on maximum of GOES peak X-ray
ﬂux converted to NOAA/GOES ﬂare classes observed in next 24 hours as shown in Fig.1. Unlike the TSF
model, this deep learning model outputs ﬂaring probability for the entire full-disk and its implementation
is based on Pandey et al. (2021).

We used trimonthly partitioning for training our models, which is non-chronological time-segmented
partitioning strategy, where Partition-1 contains data from January to March, Partition-2 from April to June,
Partition-3 from July to September, and Partition-4 from October to December in a timeline from 2010 to

2018. The AR-based model also uses the same partitioning for aligning our training partitions and avoiding
the penetration of training partitions into testing data in different prediction modalities to ensure the fair
comparisons and avoid partial memorization through temporal coherence Ahmadzadeh et al. (2021).

3.2 Flare Prediction Ensemble

Our active region-based model outputs probabilities of ﬂare (PF L) for each active region which we then
aggregate to obtain a restricted full-disk ﬂaring probability (i.e., from active regions in central locations).
We use the following heuristic function in Eq. (1) to determine aggregated active region ﬂaring probability.

Paggregated = 1 −

(cid:2)1 − PF L(ARi)(cid:3)

(cid:89)

, where PF L (ARi) is the ﬂaring probability of an active region, and the aggregated result calculates the
probability of having at least one ﬂaring active region, assuming the ﬂaring events from active regions
are conditionally independent. The product term calculates the probability of having no ﬂaring active
regions. These aggregated results from the active-region based model are then concatenated with full-disk
model’s output. The aggregation procedure searches for most-recent valid active-region predictions up to 6
hours prior to the designated forecast issue time. These gathered predictions from full-disk and aggregated
full-disk probabilities are then combined to issue a ﬁnal ﬂare forecast using an ensemble. In this work,

while preparing our ﬁnal dataset for the full-disk model, we do not include magnetogram images where the
observation time of the available image and requested image timestamp is more than six hours. Therefore
due to data unavailability through helioviewer, we have used a total of 4,235 data instances, where 3,502
are No Flare (NF) instances and 733 are Flare (FL) instances. The detailed distribution of the dataset
for each tri-monthly partition is shown in Fig. 2 and the class imbalance ratios across the partitions are
generally consistent from ∼ 12 to 22% (∼3.6:1 to ∼7.2:1).

Figure 2. Total number of Flare and No Flare instances across 4 trimonthly partitions used in this work3

In our baseline meta-model approach, we use equal weighted averaging of ﬂare probabilities from
aggregated active-regions and full-disk ﬂaring probabilities for issuing a ﬁnal forecast. In other words,
given two ﬂaring probabilities from two approaches, the baseline approach is to compute the arithmetic
average of the probabilities, assuming equal importance. This simplistic combination of ﬂare probabilities
will serve as our baseline, although it is a naive approach that does not consider the intrinsic characteristics
of long-term diagnostic results from the models.

Our alternative approach to the baseline meta-model is logistic regression-based classiﬁer that is trained
with ﬂaring probabilities from the base learners. As we already use two powerful algorithms to train our
base learner to extract the complex dynamics of the datasets, we chose a linear model, logistic regression,

3 We note that, while aggregating active regions based outputs to full-disk probabilities, there were instances that were not available even when we search for
most-recent valid active-region predictions up to 6 hours prior to the designated forecast. Therefore, such instances are also removed from full-disk models for
consistency.

because of its simplicity and computational efﬁciency for the ﬁnal prediction result.The infrastructure of
our complete ﬂare prediction system design is presented in Fig. 3 which shows our overall methodology
for creating an ensemble using two heterogeneous base learners that outputs a full-disk ﬂare forecast.

where, Z in Eq. ( 2) is the linear combination of two base learners’ output, σ is the sigmoid activation

to get the better values of weights using a logistic loss function as shown in Eq. ( 4).

our meta model, referred to as Meta-FP, interchangeably. We note that we aim to provide full-disk forecasts
by computing the aggregated ﬂare probability scores from active regions to make it compatible with the
full-disk model using the probabilistic heuristic shown in Eq. ( 1).

4 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

4.1 Experimental Settings

In this work, we trained two base learners for ﬂare prediction (≥M1.0-class ﬂares) with two different
dataset and model conﬁgurations and architectures. Although our two base learners utilize two different
data modalities (i.e., point-in-time image and multivariate time series), we used time-segmented tri-monthly
partitioning when training both of these models. We divided our datasets into four partitions to ready our
3-fold holdout cross-validation dataset. The data in Partition-1 contains images from the months of January
to March, Partition-2 from April to June, Partition-3 from July to September, and Partition-4 from October
to December. Here, this partitioning of the dataset is created by dividing the data timeline from Dec 2010 to
Dec 2018 into four partitions on the basis of months rather than chronological partitioning, to incorporate
approximately equal distribution of ﬂaring instances in every fold for training , validating, and testing the
model. Furthermore, such a partitioning strategy diversify the data instances in both the training and testing
phase of our models as it considers instances during solar maxima and minima of solar cycle 24 used in
this work.

We create three sets of base learner models from 3-fold cross-validation experiments as our base learners

where we use Partition-3 as our hold-out test set (i.e., never used in training and validation). Then,

• In Fold-1, we trained both of our base learners with Partition-1 and Partition-2 and validated on

Partition-4

• In Fold-2, we trained both of our base learners with Partition-1 and Partition-4 and validated on

Partition-2

• In Fold-3, we trained both of our base learners with Partition-2 and Partition-4 and validated on

Partition-1.

All of these three base learners are tested on Partition-3. Partition-3 as a test differs from the validation sets
in each fold such that, we used the validation set in every epoch to track the performance of our model
whereas the test set, Partition-3, is used only once to conﬁrm the performance of the trained models and
meta-models at the end.

To train and validate our Meta-FP, we create our dataset based on the probability scores of our three base
learner sets obtained from 3-Fold cross validation experiments. The details of our experimental design is
shown in Fig. 4. We used the ﬂare probability scores from the validation set and test set used in respective
base learners interchangeably to train and validate our Meta-FP model which is a general linear model i.e.,
logistic regression (LR). The experiments for Meta-FP are performed in such way that:

• In Expt. 1, we performed 2-fold cross validation with Partition-4 and Partition-3.
• In Expt. 2, we performed 2-fold cross validation with Partition-2 and Partition-3.

• In Expt. 3, we performed 2-fold cross validation with Partition-1 and Partition-3.

In doing so, we trained six Meta-FP models based on logistic regression and compared our results with a
baseline Meta-FP which is an equal weighted average of two base learners. To evaluate the performance

of our models, we create a contingency matrix, which includes information on True Positives (TP), True
Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN) to evaluate the performance of our base
learners and Meta-FP. Note that, in the context of our ﬂare prediction task, Flare (FL) is considered as
the positive outcome while No Flare (NF) is the negative. Using these four outcomes we use two widely
used performance metrics in space weather forecasting, True Skill Statistics (TSS, shown in Eq. ( 5)) and
Heidke Skill Score (HSS, shown in Eq. ( 6)) to evaluate our model.

The values of TSS range from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates all correct predictions, -1 represents all incorrect
predictions, and 0 represents no-skill, often transpiring as the random or one-sided (all positive/all negative)
predictions. It is deﬁned as the difference between True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR)
and does not account for class-imbalance, i.e., treats false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) equally.
Similarly, HSS measures the forecast skill of the models over an imbalance-aware random prediction. It
ranges from -∞ to 1, where 1 represents the perfect skill and 0 represents no skill gain over a random
prediction. It is common practice to use HSS for the solar ﬂare prediction models (similar to weather
predictions where forecast skill has more value than accuracy or single-class precision), due to the high
class-imbalance ratio present in the datasets.

4.2 Evaluation

Although AR-based classiﬁers are better for pinpointing the source active regions for ﬂares and giving
more accurate estimations for forecasting ﬂaring phenomena, the aggregated results drop signiﬁcantly in
contrast to our expectation. The results from AR-based models shows TSS=0.82±0.02 and HSS=0.20±0.04
when these methods are evaluated solely on active region based confusion matrices. However, when
we aggregate them, these models fail to reach the acceptable levels of skill scores as they drop to
TSS=0.32±0.04 and HSS=0.15±0.02. The reason for these issues may stem from three reasons: (i)
limb events are not considered (beyond ±70◦) as there are no reliable magnetic ﬁeld readings, (ii) these
models are not optimized for full-disk ﬂare prediction, and/or (iii) an independent, equally weighted
aggregation scenario in our heuristic approach. Furthermore, the drop in aggregated skill scores can be
attributed to the number of high false positives, which is common in rare-event forecasting problems
and particularly in ﬂare forecasting. The reason we empirically observed throughout the years for these
false positives are often the models’ inability to distinguish [C4+ to C9.9] ﬂares from ≥M-class ﬂares as
discussed in Pandey et al. (2022). All in all, our ﬁrst observation is that for full-disk ﬂare prediction, our
designated deep learning models are more effective when compared to the AR aggregations as it considers
the near-limb events by using a compressed full-disk magnetogram which are suitable to capture the shape
parameters in the active regions within and beyond ±70◦ of the central meridian of the Sun.

Figure 7. Validation Scores of base learners in Fold-3 (base learners trained with Partitions 2 and 4) and
the corresponding validation scores of Meta-FP (meta models trained in Expt. 3).

Analyzing our results, we observed that our logistic regression-based Meta-FP improves on both TSS and
HSS compared to two base learners and equal weighting baseline meta learner on respective test partitions
as shown in Fig. 5, 6, 7. In our ﬁrst experiment, we trained two Meta-FP models that utilizes the ﬂare
probability scores of two base learners that are trained with Partition-1 and Partition-2 of the respective
datasets. We train and validate our Meta-FP with respect to the unused two partitions that are Partition-3
and Partition-4 for the ﬁrst experiment as shown in Fig. 5. Our other two experiments are also consistent
with making sure to only use two such partitions that have not been used while training the base learners
as shown in Fig. 6 and 7. While the improvement in terms of TSS and HSS on both the base learner
and baseline Meta-FP can be seen across all six logistic regression-based Meta-FP model, the maximum
improvement of logistic regression over base learners and baseline can be seen with base learners in Fold-1
(trained with Partition-1 and Partition-2) where the Meta-FP is trained with Partition 3 and tested on
Partition-4 (right side of the Fig. 5). In this experiment, the logistic regression model improves on full-disk
(base learner) in terms of TSS by ∼6% and HSS by ∼14%. Similarly, it improves on aggregated AR-based
models in terms of TSS by ∼22% and HSS by ∼28%. While we used the equal weighted averaging as a
baseline model, it does not improve on the results from the full-disk base learner. However, compared to
the baseline for the same experiment (Fold-1) as explained above, the logistic regression model improves
by ∼13% and ∼21% in terms of TSS and HSS respectively.

Coupling Full-disk and Active Region-based Flare Prediction

On an average, we observe that our full-disk model (base learner) has TSS=0.40±0.07 and
HSS=0.25±0.07 and the AR-based model (base learner) has TSS=0.32±0.04 and HSS=0.15±0.02
computed over both test and validation results from all three folds. When we employed the baseline
meta learner (equal-weighted average), the average TSS=0.39±0.05 and HSS=0.20±0.04 is observed.
Given that, equal weighted average is used as a common way to ensemble two or more models, it can be
problematic as it could not even surpass the scores of a base learner (full-disk model). With the logistic
regression-based meta learner (Meta-FP), the average TSS and HSS observed is 0.49±0.02 and 0.35±0.05
respectively. Therefore, we see that on an average, the Meta-FP improves on the full-disk model by ∼9%
in terms of TSS and ∼10% in terms of HSS. Similarly, it improves on the AR-based model by ∼17%
and ∼20% in terms of TSS and HSS respectively. Finally, when compared to the baseline meta model, it
improves on TSS by ∼10% and HSS by ∼15%.

5 DISCUSSION

Ensemble methods combines multiple models to obtain better predictive performance than could be
obtained from any of the constituent model alone. By using an ensemble method, we learn how the
single model output can be improved based on (a) maximum voting, (b) equal weighted averaging, and
(c) weighted voting. Learning the weights in weighted voting, in the scope of this paper, is structured
as a logistic regression problem. One usual way to create an ensemble is to simply average the forecast
probabilities of multiple models and provide a ﬁnal forecast decision, however, it is naive to assume that
all base-learners are equally good. Therefore, the main objective of training an ensemble here is to learn
and assign better weights for two base-learner predictions by quantifying the level of impact of individual
models predictions on the ﬁnal forecast. The prediction distribution for Partition-3 and Partition-4 used in
Experiment-1 for training and testing the ensemble alternatingly and the learned decision-boundary by
Meta-FP LR is shown in Fig. 8 as an example to show how an ensemble improves over the base-learner by
coupling using a linear classiﬁer. The predicted probability distribution and learned decision boundary in
Experiment-2 and 3 is presented in Fig. S1 and S2 respectively. Furthermore, the confusion matrices for
base-learners predictions and for the consequent ensembles created in all three experiments are presented
in Table S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6.

Ensemble methods defy the idea of making one model and relying on this model as the best/most accurate
predictor we can make. It rather take a multitude of models into account, and combine those models to
produce one ﬁnal model that issues a ﬁnal forecast. At this point, we do have access to very complex
machine learning paradigms that have proven to be very effective in several areas, such as computer vision
and image classiﬁcation. However, relying on the forecast of a single model for rare events like major solar
ﬂares might be critical for a system in operation. The model thus obtained might be biased on the dataset
used to train the model and can be just as good as the curated dataset used to create the model. Therefore, it
is essential to have a reliable ﬂare forecasting model obtained by assembling multiple models with different
data modalities to leverage the most with coupling.

6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this work, we trained a logistic regression-based meta learner for ﬂare prediction that combines the
probabilities of two ﬂare prediction models trained with different datasets and machine learning paradigms.
While we have two models (base learners) with their own advantages in prediction capabilities, we observed

that for base learners, full disk models have better performance for full disk ﬂare forecasting compared
to AR-aggregation. Therefore, with a motive of further improving the performance of base learners, we
explored a simplest way to combine them by training an ensemble ﬂare predictor which automates the task
of assigning weights to the outputs of our base learners, thus improving the overall performance of our
models and adding robustness to the prediction task compared to equal weighted ensembling.

Furthermore, considering that we only used bi-daily observations, the shape parameters considered in
compressed magnetograms proves to be actually powerful. AR-based models on the other hand, using
magnetic ﬁeld data, either as images or derived products, as they are now, will have limited capability
although they have higher sensitivity per active region. Therefore, a complementary approach is necessary
that does not only rely directly on magnetic ﬁeld rasters and this work introduces a technique which
considers both the magnetic-ﬁeld parameters and shape-based parameters to obtain ﬂare forecasting models
with their own essence and abilities. Finally, we combine these two heterogeneous models into one coupled
model using a linear ensemble to improve overall performance. Although we see signiﬁcant improvements
in skill scores after ensembling, our coupled models are not without limitations that are also inherited from
our full-disk based model trained with point-in-time bi-daily observations, which overlooks the temporal
evolution of magnetic-ﬁeld parameters of the active regions which can limit the predictive capabilities
of full-disk ﬂare predictors. Therefore, our next goal is to formulate the ﬂare prediction task as a video
classiﬁcation problem using full-cadence image sequences that will account for the temporal evolution
of active regions. Furthermore, there are several other directions that can be explored such as using a
basis function on the aggregated active region prediction probabilities, ﬁnding other better aggregation
strategies that could boost the performance of AR-based models while computing a full-disk probability
and elaborate the ensemble using more sophisticated classiﬁers, aiming to further improve the predictive
capabilities of our models.
