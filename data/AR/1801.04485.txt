PERSISTENCE OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL AR(1)-SEQUENCES

G ¨UNTER HINRICHS, MARTIN KOLB, AND VITALI WACHTEL

Abstract. For a class of one-dimensional autoregressive sequences (Xn) we
consider the tail behaviour of the stopping time T0 = min{n ≥ 1 : Xn ≤ 0}.
We discuss existing general analytical approaches to this and related problems
and propose a new one, which is based on a renewal-type decomposition for the
moment generating function of T0 and on the analytical Fredholm alternative.
Using this method, we show that Px(T0 = n) ∼ V (x)Rn
0 for some 0 < R0 < 1
and a positive R0-harmonic function V . Further we prove that our conditions
on the tail behaviour of the innovations are sharp in the sense that fatter tails
produce non-exponential decay factors.

1. Introduction and setting

The analysis of ﬁrst hitting times of subsets of the state space by a Markov
chain (Xn)n≥0 is a subject with a long history, but still many recent contributions.
For many applications it is important to gain precise control of the tail behaviour
of hitting times. One of the aims of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness
of the combination of analytic and probabilistic techniques using the example of
autoregressive processes.

Let ξk be independent, identically distributed random variables and let a

be a ﬁxed constant. An AR(1)-sequence is deﬁned by

Xn = aXn−1 + ξn, n

where the starting point X0 of this process may be either deterministic or dis-
If X0 = x then we write Px
tributed according to any probabilistic measure ν.
for the distribution of the process and if X0 is distributed according to ν then we
shall write Pν for the distribution of the process. The sequence (Xn)n∈N0 deﬁnes a
Markov chain with state space R, whose properties have been analysed in a great
number of papers and we only refer to some of the more recent contributions, such
as [2], [3], [7], [17], [18], [19]. Closest to our present contribution and the main stim-
ulus for the present paper is the recent work [2], where persistence probabilities for
the process (1) and its multidimensional versions have been studied. The focus of
[2] has been on deriving the existence and basic properties such as positivity and
monotonicity of the persistence exponents

i.e. the ﬁrst time at which the process becomes negative. Similar to [2], we are
going to study the tail behaviour of this stopping time, but, in contrast to [2], we
are aiming at precise instead of rough asymptotic results. This means we aim to
ﬁnd the precise, without logarithmic scaling, asymptotics of

that the tail of the stopping time T0 has an exactly exponential decay. We will
focus on the one-dimensional situation.

Denoting by P (x, dy) the transition probability of the Markov chain (Xn)n≥0 we

observe that, for every x > 0,

From the Gelfand formula for the spectral radius it is tempting to connect λa to
the spectral radius of some operator induced by P+. From an operator theoretic
perspective the problem consists in the fact that, due to the unboundednes of the
), the substochastic kernel P+ is usually not a (quasi-)compact
state space (0,

functions. One way out is to ﬁnd better adapted Banach spaces, which is often
possible. A diﬀerent strategy which we are going to present as well consists in

In fact, similar arguments
appear in the investigation of other large time problems in the theory of stochastic
processes such as [16] and [24]. In order to deduce the required properties we will
show that Ex

theoretic properties of the corresponding transition operator. This leads to a mero-

the present contribution also serves as template on powerful analytic methods for
persistence and quasistationary problems.

Several authors, see [7, 17, 18], have obtained exact expressions for the Laplace
transform in the case when the distribution of the innovations is related to the
exponential distribution. Unfortunately, the expressions are very complicated, and
it is not clear how to invert them or how to use them for deriving the tail asymptotics
for T0. Moreover, it is not clear whether one can obtain an explicit expression for
λa. If, for example, the innovations ξn have density e−µ|x|/(2µ) then, as it has been
shown in [17],

E0sT0 =

s(as, a2)∞

,

k=0(1

−

uqk). Therefore, eλa is the minimal positive solution to
where (u, q)∞ =
the equation (as, a2)∞ + (s, a2)∞ = 0. It is obvious that this solution lies between
1 and a−1, but an explicit expression is not accessible. In order to analyse the tail
behaviour of T0 we have to take into account all singularities of this function on
the circle of radius eλa , but this information is also rather hard to extract from
the exact expression. Expressions in [7] and in [18] are even more complicated.
Summarising, all known explicit expressions for the Laplace transform of T0 do not
seem to provide any useful information on the asymptotic properties of T0.

The structure of the paper is the following. In Section 2 we prove under rather

general assumptions the existence and positivity of the decay rate

λa :=

lim
n→∞

−

1
n

log Px

T0 > n

.

In Section 3 we consider the situation where the distribution of the innovations has
bounded support. In this case, one can use results in [5] in order to show that the
tails have a precise exponential decay. For unbounded innovations this approach is
no longer possible.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

In order to be able to cover also unbounded innovations we introduce in Section
4 a diﬀerent functional analytic approach relying on the concept of a quasicompact
operator and the associated spectral theory.

Section 5 presents another way to deal with unbounded innovations, which is
based on a renewal argument in combination with some basic operator theoretic
arguments applied to the renewal operator.

Section 6 deals with the situation of regularly varying case, where the foregoing

theory is not applicable.

In Section 7, the essential ingredients of our techniques and their applicability

to diﬀerent problems are discussed.

2. Rough asymptotics for persistence probabilities

In this section we establish a general result concerning the exponential decay of
the tails of the hitting time T0. Results of this type will be an essential ingredient
for the further investigation of more detailed properties of the ﬁrst hitting time T0.
More precisely, we shall derive asymptotics for the logarithmically scaled tail of T0.
In contrast to [2] we study the one-dimensional situation, but there we are able to
work under much weaker hypotheses.

P(ξ1 > 0) > 0 is imposed to avoid a trivial situation when the chain Xn is mono-
tone decreasing before hitting negative numbers. As it has been mentioned at the
beginning of this section, the existence of the logarithmic moment yields the er-
godicity of Xn. Finally, the ﬁniteness of E(ξ+
1 )δ is needed for the positivity of λa
only.

Existence and ﬁniteness of the limit λa follow also from Theorem 2.3 in [2] in a
multidimensional situation at least under the condition that an exponential moment
exists. We use a weaker moment assumption E(ξ+

Relation (6) is a simple consequence of relation (2.4) in [2]. It should be noted
that the proof of (2.4) does not use the assumption that the innovations are normally
distributed and, consequently, we may use (2.4) in the proof of (6).

We conclude this section with the following open problem: For which starting
distributions µ(dx) = P(X0 ∈
dx) the statement of Theorem 1 remains valid?
A general observation that the persistence exponent may depend on the initial
distribution of an AR(1)-sequence has been made in Proposition 2.2 in [2]. The
reader can ﬁnd conditions on the initial distribution in [2], in [6] and also in Section
4.2 below ensuring the validity of Theorem 1. Until now a complete characterization
does not seem to exist. At this point we want to emphasize that this phenomenon is
well known in the theory of quasistationary distributions and is strongly related to
the fact that quasistationary distributions are not unique in general (see e.g. [8]).
Conditions ensuring uniqueness of quasistationary distributions are given in [5].

3. Innovations with bounded to the right support:
approach via quasistationarity
Exponential decay of P(T0 > n) is often related to a quasi-stationary behaviour
. Recall that the quasistationarity

T0 > n

of (Xn) conditioned on the event
implies that

{

}

P(T0 > n + 1

T0 > n)

e−λa.

|

→

So, the logarithmic asymptotics in Theorem 1 should also follow from the quasis-
tionarity of (Xn). Furthermore, it is quite natural to expect that the knowledge on
the rate of convergence towards a quasi-stationary distribution will imply preciser
statements on the tail behaviour of T0. This has been recently conﬁrmed in [5],
where necessary and suﬃcient conditions for an exponentail speed of convergence
in the total variation norm to a quasistationary distribution have been provided.
There, it has also been shown that such fast convergence yields a purely exponential
decay of P(T0 > n).

Let us formulate conditions from [5] in terms of the AR(1)-sequence (Xn)n∈N0 .

First condition: there exist a probability measure ν and constants n0 ≥

It is rather obvious that (14) can not be valid for all x > 0. This observation implies
that the results in [5] are not applicable to AR(1)-sequences with unbounded to
the right innovations. So, we shall assume that innovations ξk are bounded. Let R
denote, as in the previous section, the essential supremum of ξ1. Then the invariant
measure lives on the set (
a). If the starting point
lies in (0, R∗] then the chain Xn does not exceed R∗ at all times. Consequently,
we have to ﬁnd restrictions on the distribution of innovations which will ensure the
validity of (13) and (14) for x

4. Functional analytic approaches

In this section we combine probabilistic insights with some basic functional an-
alytic observations in order to derive the precise tail behaviour of T0. We want to
stress that even though we call this approach functional analytic we will only make
use of rather fundamental properties of compact operators combined with asser-
tions of Perron-Frobenius type. The functional analytic ingredients can be found
in standard references such as [1], [9], [14] and [22].

4.1. Quasi-compactness approach for bounded innovations. The initial idea
from the introduction can be most straightforwardly carried through for bounded
innovations ξi. We assume that they have a density ϕ which is strictly positive on
A, B] (A, B > 0) and consider P+f (x) := Ef (ax + ξ1) (where
all of its support [
−
f (y) := 0 for y < 0) as an operator on C
with the supremum norm. In
this case, we are going to show that P+ is compact with a simple largest eigenvalue

Px(T0 > n) = P n

+1[0,∞)(x) = V (x)e−λa n + O(e−(λa+ε)n)

(20)

for some nonnegative V and ε > 0. Apart from condition (19), which is not needed
in this approach, the result is contained in Theorem 5. Our main purpose here is to
ﬁnally lead over to those cases of unbounded innovations in which conditions from
[5] are not valid.

Consequently, all eigenvalues of P+ must have modulus less than 1. We now invoke
the following generalization of the Perron-Frobenius theorem (see Theorems 6 and
7 in [21]):

(21)

(22)

Theorem A (see [21]). Let K be a proper closed cone in a Banach space B which
is fundamental and assume that B is a lattice with respect to the ordering induced
B be quasicompact operator, which is positive with respect to
by K. Let T : B
f ∗ > 0 there
K, i.e. T K
exists an integer n(f, f ∗)

b) the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue r(T ) is one-dimensional and

functions. It is closed, proper (i.e. K
that K spans a dense subset of B, which is clear since K
K = B). P+, taking the
role of T , is positive. The density ϕ was assumed to be strictly positive, so positivity
holds true even in the stronger sense that P+ maps nonnegative functions which are
somewhere strictly positive to functions which are everywhere strictly positive. For
our choice of the space B its dual space B∗ consists of all functionals f

with ﬁnite signed Borel measures µ, positive functionals correspond to positive
measures. Therefore, this strong positivity implies that f ∗(T f ) > 0 for all f > 0

that the corresponding dual space consists of signed ﬁnitely additive and absolutely

In other words, we have an exponentially fast convergence to a quasistationary

4.2. Quasi-compactness approach for unbounded innovations. If the inno-
vations ξi are absolutely continuous, but are unbounded, P+ still maps bounded
families to equicountinous ones and has the same positivity properties, but is in
general not compact. A way out is to choose a more suitable Banach space. This
can be, for example, explicitely carried through in the case of innovations with
standard normal distributions. In this case, X is a discretized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process: The latter is given, e.g., by the stochastic diﬀerential equation

dZt = θZt dt + σdBt, Z0 = x,

12

HINRICHS, KOLB, AND WACHTEL

where θ, σ > 0 are constants and (Bt)t≥0 denotes a Brownian motion. The random
variable Zt is normal distributed with

E[Zt] = xe−θt

and Var[Zt] =

[20] as well as [12]). In the literature on quasistationary distributions an approach
of this type has been presented in [11]. Our main goal is to indicate via the ex-
ample of autoregressive processes that the results of [6] can be to a large extent
reproved via the concept of quasicompact operators. We hope that our outline of
standard analytic ideas in a probabilistic context iluminates further the interrela-
tionship between probabilistic and analytic concepts related to persistence expo-
nents/quasistationarity on the one hand and spectral theoretic ideas on the other.

power moments. Therefore, the condition Eelog1+b ξ1 <

the existence of all power moments.

5. Alternative approach for unbounded innovations

In this section we present another approach to investigate the tails of the hit-
ting times, which, in contrast to Perron-Frobenius-type methods, has the potential
to deal with situations where the transition operator is not quasicompact and to
identify additional polynomial decay factors. Apart from birth/death processes
and one-dimensional diﬀusions quasistationary convergence in cases with no spec-
tral gap has not yet been established. Moreover, only basic properties of compact
operators play a role and therefore the functional analytic machinery will be more
straightforward.

As an alternative to the search for a weight function, we now start with the
following observation: The larger Xn is, the more it is diminished by the prefactor
a in the recursion Xn+1 = aXn+ξn+1. In contrast, adding ξn+1 has always the same
absolute eﬀect, no matter how large Xn is. Therefore, in some sense, it is easier

16

HINRICHS, KOLB, AND WACHTEL

for the process to reach average positive values from extremely large values than to
reach zero from average values, so, also in the case of unbounded innovations, the
main part in estimating Px(T0 > n) should still be to analyse what happens for not
too large x.

The transition operator will in general not be (quasi-)compact on the usual space
C(R+
0 ), but, as shown on the next pages, a modiﬁed functional analytic approach,
in which one basically works on the continuous functions on some interval and keeps
under control what happens outside, is possible. In contrast, the “coming down
from inﬁnity” which we just described has not the uniform character that would be
needed to apply the results in [5].

Here is the main result of this section:

Theorem 10. Assume that the distribution of innovations has a density ϕ(x) which
is positive a.e. on R. Assume also that E(ξ+
for all t > 0 and E(ξ−
for some δ > 0. Then there exist γ > 0 and a positive function V such that

Again, this result describes not only the exact asymptotic behaviour of Px(T0 =
n) but states also that the remainder term decays exponentially faster than the main
term. It is worth mentioning that the existence of all power moments required in
Theorem 10 is the minimal moment condition. More precisely, we shall show in
Proposition 19 that if the tail of ξ1 is regularly varying then it may happen that
eλanP(T0 > n)

0.

The starting point of the approach, which we are going to use in this section,

clude that λa is a pole. Observe that this implies that the operator valued function
Kz)−1 has a pole at z = λa. Therefore, we conclude that Kλa has the eigenvalue
(I
1.

Observe next that for λ < λa + ε the operator Kλ is positive and compact on
the Banach lattice X. Using the second part of Lemma 15 we conclude by the clas-
sical Krein-Rutman theorem as given in Theorem 4 of [21] that the spectral radius
r(Kλ) > 0 is in fact an eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity one and the associated
eigenfunction can be chosen to be non-negative. Furthermore, by Theorem 2.1 in
[10] the spectral radius is continuous in λ.

We now claim that 1 coincides with the spectral radius of Kλa . Assume con-
trary that the spectral radius r(Kλa ) of Kλa is strictly bigger then 1. Under this
assumption and the continuity of the spectral radius we conclude that for λ < λa
we still have ρ(Kλ) > 1. We now claim, that this contradicts that the equation

Lλ = Fλ + KλLλ

(40)

24

We now aim to show that the function L has a simple pole at λa. Here, we can
observe that the derivative d

the Banach space X. Therefore, we have shown, that the properties P 1, P 2 and
P 3 in [24] are satisﬁed and, as shown on page 233 of [24], we can then conclude via
Corollary 1 in [24] that the pole at λa is in fact simple.

Now assume that L(z) has another pole at z = λa + iψ, i.e. Kz has an eigenvalue
1 with some eigenfunction g there. Applying the triangle inequality to the deﬁnition

Completion of the proof of Theorem 10. It follows from the Proposition 18 that the
generating function Ex[zT0] has the unique simple pole at eλa and that there are
no further poles on the disc or radius eλa+γ with some γ > 0. Then we have the
following representation

(cid:3)

In order to see, that spectral properties remain relevant in the situation at hand
we observe the following assertion formulated in terms of Tweedie’s R-theory (see
[25] and [26]).

28

HINRICHS, KOLB, AND WACHTEL

Corollary 21. Assume that the conditions (50) and (52) are satisﬁed. Then for r
large enough the operator Kλa is well deﬁned and the spectral radius r(Kλa ) belongs
to [0, 1]. Under the assumption r(Kλa ) < 1 the Laplace transform of T0 remains
bounded up to the critical line. In particular, the Submarkovian transition operator
P is R-transient in the sense of Tweedie.

Until now a complete analysis of persistence probabilities including the eﬀects
of polynomial decay factors as well as thorough investigation the quasistationary
behaviour of AR(1) sequences with heavy tailed innovations does not seem to exist
and constitutes an interesting open problem.

7. Discussion

In this section we summarise the general ideas of the two main analytic ap-
proaches used in this work and comment on their possible applicability to other
models. As a matter of fact both approaches use diﬀerent tools but also share some
structural similarites. For a Markov process (Xn)n∈N0 we want to ﬁnd the precise
tail behaviour of the ﬁrst hitting time TB of a measurable subset B of the state
space.

•

The ﬁrst approach is in essence spectral theoretic. We ﬁrst analyse the
decay rate

θB =

lim
n→∞

−

1
n

log Px

TB > n

and make sure that θB does not depend on the starting point. The second
step consists in showing that for a strictly larger measurable set B′
B
one has

⊃

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

θB < θB′ .

(54)

This allows to introduce a suitable weighted Banach space and under ap-
propriate conditions on the distribution of the innovations to prove the
quasicompactness of the killed transition kernel. Application of a suitable
result of Perron-Frobenius type allows to establish precise exponential de-
cay of the tails of TB.
The second approach consists in analysing the Laplace transform

{

| ℜ

z < θB + ε

near the abscissa of convergence θB. We prove that Fλ(x) has a meromor-
phic extension to
for some ε > 0 with λB being a
pole. This allows to deduce the precise exponential decay using a suitable
Tauberian theorem. In order to prove the existence of a meromorphic ex-
tension we derive a renewal type equation in terms of the transition kernel
Kλ. The existence of a meromorphic extension is shown using the analytic
Fredholm alternative and suitable properties of Kλ. In particular, we need
to show that the operators Kλ are compact for all λ with
λ < λa + ε and
satisfy the conditions of a suitable Perron-Frobenius theorem. Here results
of the type given in (54) are again essential as well as absolute continuity
and strict positivity of the transition kernel.

ℜ

We believe that these methods can be applied without big changes to some other
Markov chain models. For example, to max-autoregressive processes or to random
exchange processes, which are quite closely related to AR(1)-sequences, see [27].

PERSISTENCE OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL AR(1)-SEQUENCES

29

In both approaches, we have assumed that the underlying distributions are ab-
solutely continuous with almost everywhere positive density and have suﬃciently
light tails. The positivity on the whole axis has been used only to give very simple
proofs of the posivity of compact operators. We believe that this positivity can
be shown also in the case when the density is zero on signiﬁcant parts of the axis.
Probably one will have the positivity of an appropriate power of the operator, but
this does not restrict the applicability of Perron-Frobenius type results. The abso-
lute continuity assumption seems to be really crucial for both approaches, and it
is not clear whether one can replace it by the existence of an absolute continuous
component. A very challenging problem is to study the case of discrete innovations.
The second approach might also be applicable to chains with a certain period-
icity, presumably resulting in poles of higher order. A diﬀerent behaviour of the
pole(s) also can be expected in the presence of distributions with regularly varying
tails. Getting completely rid of absolute continuity seems so be much more tricky.
Moreover, the stochastic monotonicity of AR(1)-sequences was extensively used, a
lack of this property is expected to result in largely technical complications.

The authors of [6] are able to prove similar results using a diﬀerent approach.

Their conditions are of the following types (see page 8 in [6]):

Local minorization of Doeblin-type
Two global Lyapunov criteria
Local Harnack inequality
Aperiodicity

•
•
•
•

The approach used by Champagnat and Villemonais is more related to coupling
ideas of Doeblin type. The global Lypunov criteria are related to our condition (54)
whereas the local minorization, the local Harnack inequality as well as the aperiod-
icity are closer to the condition used in our approaches to prove quasicompactness
with a leading eigenvalue of mulitiplicity one in approach one and compactness
of the renewal operator with a leading eigenvalue of multiplicity one in approach
two. All three approaches have their merits. As far as possible extensions to AR(1)-
processes with fat tailed innovations are concerned, the approach in Section 5 seems
to be most promising.
