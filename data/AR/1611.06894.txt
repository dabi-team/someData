1.  Introduction 

WEST (Tungsten (W) Environment in Steady-state Tokamak) will start operating in 2016 as a 

test  bed  for  ITER  divertor  components  in  long  pulse  operation.  In  this  context,  radiative 

cooling  of  heavy  impurities  like  tungsten  (W)  sputtered  from  Plasma  Facing  Components 

(PFC)  into  the  plasma  core  is  a  critical  issue  for  the  plasma  performances  and  stability. 
Indeed,  even  small  W  concentrations  such  as  3.10-5  increases  by  20%  the  minimum  triple 

product nTτE required to make the thermonuclear burn possible [1], and can sometimes lead to 

radiative  collapse.  Thus  reliable  tools  are  needed  to  monitor  W  density  and  avoid  its 

accumulation  in  the  plasma  core,  where  its  radiation  is  dominant  in  the  Soft  X-ray  (SXR) 

range  0.1  keV  –  15  keV  with  complex  contributions  from  line  transition,  radiative 

recombination and Bremsstrahlung emission.  

The SXR diagnostic of  WEST  will be equipped 

with  two  new  GEM  (Gas  Electron  Multiplier) 

based  poloidal  cameras  [2],  [3]  allowing  to 

perform  2D  tomographic  reconstructions  in  a 

poloidal  cross-section  [4],  see  Fig.1,  and  with 

spectral  resolution  in  tunable  energy  bands,  in 

the  contrast  with  former  Tore  Supra  silicon 

barrier  diodes  working  in  current  mode.  Thus 

once  the  GEM  response  to  plasma  emissivity  is

characterized thanks to a synthetic diagnostic, it will offer new possibilities [5] to disentangle 

the different SXR contributions in the prospect of W monitoring in harsh fusion environments 

 
 
 
 
like WEST or ITER. In this work, a simple model is developed to predict GEM response to 

SXR  radiation.  Then,  parametrization  of  the  model  is  performed  using  Magboltz  [6].  This 
model  is  validated  by  comparison  to  experimental  results  with  Fe55  radioactive  sources. 

Finally, work is ongoing to apply the synthetic diagnostic on WEST cases with W impurities. 

2.  A simple model of GEM response to SXR radiation 

The  GEM  diagnostic 

is  structured  as  follows. 

Photoionization  occurring  for  each  detected  X-ray 

photon  in  the  GEM  gas  mixture  Ar-CO2  (70-30%) 

produces an electron cloud in the conversion chamber. 

This  electron  cloud  drifts  and  diffuses  in  the  gas 

toward the anode due to electric fields 𝐸𝐼,𝑇,𝐶

⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗  of a few 

kV/cm,  see  Fig.2.  The  three  GEM  foils  under  high 

Figure 2. Layout of the GEM principle 

voltages  𝑉𝐺𝐸𝑀 ∽ 400𝑉 amplify the  electron cloud  by 

electron avalanching. The total electron cloud charge is thus collected on the anode strips with 
a linear average gain 𝐺̅. Photon energy, time and position values are computed and stored. In 

this  section,  the  implementation  of  these  successive  processes  in  the  synthetic  diagnostic  is 

briefly discussed.  

Each incoming X-ray photon of energy hν passing 

through  the  SXR  filters  can  be  detected  by 

photoionization  of  an  Argon  atom,  see  [7]  and 

Fig.3, releasing a free electron of energy E ≃ hv – 

Eb, where Eb is the binding energy of the electron. 

This  energetic  electron  creates  an  electron  cloud 

by collision with neighboring gas atoms, resulting 

in  𝐸 𝑤⁄   electron-ion  pairs,  where 

the  mean

ionisation energy w(Ar-CO2) ≈ 28 eV. The residual energy Eb in the photoionized Argon atom 

can  be  released  by  Auger  emission  such  that  the  total  average  number  of  electron-ion  pairs 
𝑁̅ ≃ ℎ𝑣 𝑤⁄  ~ 102. For hv ≳ 3.2 keV there is a probability of 0.14 to have instead emission of 

a  2.9  keV  photon  by  Argon  K  fluorescence  [8]  that  can  escape  the  detecting  volume.  This 

missing energy leads to a parent Argon escape peak in the GEM signal. 

The electric field ~ 50-100 kV/cm in GEM holes of r1 - r0 ~ 50µm is high enough, see Fig.4, 

to trigger electron avalanches by collision with gas atoms:

where 𝐴̅ > 1 is the amplification factor, α is the first Townsend coefficient and 𝐺̅ ~ 102-104 is 

the average gain. The associated relative standard deviation is determined by:

where  F  (~  0.19  for  Argon)  is  the  Fano  factor  [9]  and  f  ~  0.6  is  the  electron  avalanche 

standard deviation. This corresponds to a loss of spectral resolution of ~ 5-10% per GEM foil. 

The spatial electron distribution n(x,y,z,t) is determined by solving the 3D advection-diffusion 

equation [10], in presence of electric field 𝐸⃗  = 𝐸𝑧𝑢𝑧⃗⃗⃗⃗ , and applied on the electron cloud.

The  drift  velocity  vz  and  diffusion 

coefficients  DL,T  of  the  electron  cloud 

are  determined  using 

the  program 

Magboltz  [6],  see  Fig.  4.  Magboltz 

solves the Boltzmann equations to study 

electron  avalanche  and  transport  in  a 

given  gas  mixture  under  influence  of 

electric  and  magnetic 

fields.  The 

magnetic 

field  created  by  WEST 

magnetic coils will be up to 0.3 T at the 

GEM  location  and  might  interfere  with 

the  electron  cloud  transport.  However, 

Magboltz  simulations  have  shown  [11] 

Figure 4. Magboltz parametrization of electron avalanche and 
transport coefficients at B = 0 T 

that the deflection of electron trajectories (so called the  Lorentz angle) due to  the ExB drift 

should  not  exceed  ~5°  in  the  worst  case,  well  below  the  deflection  limit  of  1  pixel  (~10°). 

Furthermore, an additional µ-metal shielding will decrease the magnetic field below 0.1 T to 

avoid any perturbative effect on the GEM. 

3.  Tests with a Fe55 radioactive source 

The  synthetic  diagnostic  is  applied  to  a  radioactive  Fe55  source  (5.9  keV)  with  a  2D  square 

GEM.  Fig.5 shows the results of the simulation, including the charge spatial distribution on 
the  GEM  anode  (left)  and  the  Fe55  spectrum  acquired  by  the  GEM  (right)  with  its  Argon 

 
 
escape peak at ~ 3 keV. These results are in agreement with experimental tests performed at 

IPPLM on a 2D hexagonal GEM prototype [12].

the charge value distribution (right). 

Two  Fe55  sources  will  be  implemented  in  WEST  SXR  cameras  in  order  to  allow  an  in  situ 

spectral calibration of the GEM before and after every plasma discharge. 

4.  Perspectives for tungsten monitoring on WEST 

WEST  will  be  the  first  tokamak  to  use  the  GEM  technology  as  SXR  diagnostic  for  plasma 

tomography,  using  a  Minimum  Fisher  algorithm  [13].  Preliminary  ongoing  studies  on  the 
 = 0.6 MA [14] 
standard WEST Physics basis scenario with heating power of 12 MW and Ip
are  encouraging  in  terms  of  incoming  photon  flux  (105-107  ph/strip/s),  tomographic 

reconstruction capabilities and observation of W poloidal asymmetries. Furthermore, W line 

radiation  around  ~2  keV  might  be  disentangled  from  the  continuum  background  plasma 

radiation ≳ 4 keV by choosing appropriately the GEM energy bands.
