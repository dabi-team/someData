Abstract—Discrete phase shifters of intelligent reﬂecting sur-
face (IRS) generates phase quantization error (QE) and degrades
the receive performance at the receiver. To make an analysis of
the performance loss caused by IRS with phase QE, based on the
law of large numbers, the closed-form expressions of signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) performance loss (PL), achievable rate (AR),
and bit error rate (BER) are successively derived under line-of-
sight (LoS) channels and Rayleigh channels. Moreover, based on
the Taylor series expansion, the approximate simple closed form
of PL of IRS with approximate QE is also given. The simulation
results show that the performance losses of SNR and AR decrease
as the number of quantization bits increase, while they gradually
increase with the number of IRS phase shifter elements increase.
Regardless of LoS channels or Rayleigh channels, when the
number of quantization bits is larger than or equal to 3, the
performance losses of SNR and AR are less than 0.23dB and
0.08bits/s/Hz, respectively, and the BER performance degradation
is trivial. In particular, the performance loss difference between
IRS with QE and IRS with approximate QE is negligible when
the number of quantization bits is not less than 2.

I. INTRODUCTION

With the rapid development of wireless networks, the de-
mands for high rate, high quality, and ubiquitous wireless
services will result in high energy consumption like the ﬁfth
generation (5G) systems [1]. To achieve an innovative, energy-
efﬁcient and low-cost wireless network, intelligent reﬂecting
surface (IRS) has emerged as a new and promising solution.
IRS, consisting of a large number of low-cost passive reﬂective
elements integrated on a plane, can signiﬁcantly enhance the
performance of wireless communication networks by intel-
ligently reconﬁguring the wireless propagation environment
[2]–[4]. There are heavy research activities on the investigation
of various IRS-aided wireless networks [5]–[13].

Assuming all channels are the line-of-sight (LoS) channels,
the authors in [14] maximized the secrecy rate (SR) by jointly
optimizing IRS phases, and the trajectory and power control
of unmanned aerial vehicle, based on the successive convex
approximation, and the SR was signiﬁcantly improved with
the assistance of IRS. In [15], a secure IRS-aided directional
modulation network was investigated, and two alternating
iterative algorithms, general alternating iterative and null-
space projection, were proposed to maximize the SR. An
IRS-assisted downlink multi-user multi-antenna system in the
absence of direct links between the base station (BS) and user
was proposed in [16], a hybrid beamforming scheme with
continuous digital beamforming for the BS and discrete analog
beamforming for the IRS was proposed to maximize sum-rate.
In [17], the phase shifters of multiple IRSs were optimized
to maximize rate, based on the least-squares method,
the
substantial rate gains were achieved compared to the baseline
schemes. The problem of joint active and passive beamforming
optimization for an IRS-aided downlink multi-user multiple-
input multiple-output (MIMO) system was investigated in [18],
where a vector approximate message passing algorithm was
proposed to optimize the IRS phase shifts. In [19], the transmit
covariance matrix and passive beamforming matrices of the
two cooperative IRSs were jointly optimized to maximize rate,
and a novel low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm
was presented.

in order to enhance the security,

Actually, there are many works focusing on the beam-
forming methods in the Rayleigh channels. An IRS-assisted
multiple-input single-output (MISO) system without eaves-
dropper’s channel state information (CSI) was proposed in
[20],
the oblique mani-
fold method and minorization-maximization algorithms were
proposed to jointly optimize the precoder and IRS phase
shift. In [21], the continuous transmit beamforming at the
access point (AP) and discrete reﬂect beamforming at the
IRS were jointly optimized to minimize the transmit power
at AP. An efﬁcient alternating optimization algorithm was
proposed and near-optimal performance was achieved. An
IRS-aided secure multigroup multicast MISO communication
system was proposed in [22], and the semideﬁnite relaxation
scheme and a low-complexity algorithm based on second-order
cone programming were designed to minimize the transmit
power. In [23], based on the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm, the
source precoders and IRS phase shift matrix in the full-duplex
MIMO two-way communication system were optimized to
maximize the sum rate. A fast converging alternating algorithm
to maximize the sum rate was proposed in [24]. Compared to

 
 
 
 
 
 
the algorithm in [23], the proposed algorithm achieved a faster
convergence rate and lower computational complexity. In [25],
the authors proposed to invoke an IRS at the cell boundary of
multiple cells to assist the downlink transmission to cell-edge
users, and the precoding matrices at the BSs and IRS phase
shifts were jointly optimized to maximize the weighted sum
rate of all users.

Similar to that discrete-quantized radio frequency phase
shifter would cause performance loss in [26]–[28], using
discrete-phase shifters in IRS will also result in performance
loss in IRS-aided wireless network [16], [21], [29]. Choosing a
proper number of quantization bits for discrete-phase shifters
with a given performance loss will provide a reference for
striking a good balance between hardware circuit cost and
performance loss. However, to the best of our knowledge, there
is no research work on performance loss analysis of the IRS
with discrete-phase shifters. Thus, in what follows, we will
present an analysis on impact of discrete-phase shifters on
the performance of IRS-aided wireless network system in this
paper. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

1) To make an analysis of performance loss caused by
discrete-phase shifters, an IRS-aided wireless network is
considered. We assume that all channels are LoS chan-
nels. Based on the law of large numbers, the closed-form
expressions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance
loss, achievable rate (AR), and bit error rate (BER) are
successively derived. Simulation results show that the
performance losses of SNR and AR gradually decrease
as the number of quantization bits increase, while they
gradually increase as the number of IRS phase shifter
increases. When the number of quantization bits is
equal to 3, the performance losses of SNR and AR are
respectively less than 0.23dB and 0.08bits/s/Hz, and the
BER performance degradation is negligible.

2) In the Rayleigh fading channels, with the weak law
the
of large numbers and the Rayleigh distribution,
closed-form expressions of SNR performance loss (PL)
is derived while AR and BER with PL are given.
In addition, based on the Taylor series expansion, the
simple approximate performance loss (APL) expression
of SNR is derived whereas AR and BER with APL
are given. Simulation results show that the SNR, AR
and BER PL tendencies in the Rayleigh channels are
similar to those in LoS channels. That is, 3-bit phase
shifters are sufﬁcient to achieve an omitted performance
loss. In particular, the approximate simple expression of
performance loss makes a good approximation to the
true performance loss when the number of quantization
bits is larger than or equal to 2.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II describes the system model of a typical IRS-aided three-
node wireless network. The performance loss derivations in
the LoS and Rayleigh channels are presented in Section III
and Section IV, respectively. Numerical simulation results are
presented in Section V. Finally, we draw conclusions in Section
VI.

In this section, it is assumed that all channels are the LoS
channels. The use of IRS with discrete phase shifters may lead
to phase quantization errors. In what follows, we will make a
comprehensive investigation of the impact of IRS with discrete
phase shifters on SNR, AR, and BER.

h(θ) =

Observing the above equation, it is apparently that if and only
if
φm = 0, the phase alignment at user is achieved to realize
the optimal coherent combining gain M 2. Due to the use of
ﬁnite phase shifting, in general,
φm is random and is unequal
to zero, this means that the combining gain is lower than or far
less than M 2. In other words, the receive performance decays.

where β and µ depend on the type of approximation and the
modulation type, β represents the number of nearest neighbors
to a constellation at the minimum distance, and µ is a constant
that is related to minimum distance to average symbol energy,

is a phase quantization error due to the effect of phase
mismatching, i.e.,

incurred. Due to the phase mismatching of discrete phase

In this section, simulation results are presented to evaluate
the effect of phase mismatching caused by IRS with dis-
crete phase shifters from three different aspects: SNR, AR,
and BER. The path loss at the distance ¯d is modeled as
g( ¯d) = PL0 −
30dB represents
the path loss reference distance d0 = 1m, and γ is the
path loss exponent. The path loss exponents of Alice
IRS,
IRS
Bob channels are respectively chosen
as 2, 2, and 2 in the LoS channels, and the one are respectively
set to be 2.5, 2.5, and 3.5 in the Rayleigh channels. The
default system parameters are chosen as follows: M = 128,
d = λ/2, θab = π/2, θai = π/4, dab = 100m, dai = 30m,
Pa = 30dBm. αai = αib = αab = 0.5.

LoS and Rayleigh channels, respectively, where three different
IRS element numbers M are chosen: 8, 64 and 1024. It can
be seen from the two subﬁgures that regardless of the case
of performance loss (PL) or APL, the SNR performance loss
in the LoS channels and Rayleigh channels decreases as the
number of quantization bits k increases, while it increases with
M increases. In addition, when k is larger than or equal to
3, the SNR performance loss is less than 0.23dB even when
the number of IRS phase shift elements M tends to large
scale (e.g., M = 1024). This means that 3 bits is sufﬁcient to
achieve a trivial performance loss.

Figs. 3 (a) and (b) show the curves of AR versus the number
k of quantization bits ranging from 1 to 6 in LoS and Rayleigh
channels, respectively, where SNR is equal to 15dB. From
Fig. 3, it is seen that the AR performance loss at Bob decreases
as k increases, and increases as M increases. Additionally, the
AR increases as the number of IRS phase shift elements M
increases. Compared with the case of no PL, 3 quantization
bits achieves a AR performance loss less than 0.08 bits/s/Hz

in the cases of PL and APL regardless of the number of IRS
phase shift elements. When the number of quantization bits is
larger than or equal to 2, the simple approximate PL expression
coincides with the true performance loss.

Fig. 4 illustrates the curves of BER versus the number k of
quantization bits from 1 to 6, where SNR is equal to
5dB.
From Fig. 4, it can be seen that with increasing the number
k of quantization bits, the BER performances of PL and APL
rapidly approach that no PL. When k reaches up to 3, the BER
performances of PL and APL are almost identical to that of no
PL, which means that it is feasible in practice to use discrete
phase shifters with k = 3 to achieve a trivial performance loss.
This dramatically reduces the circuit cost and the required CSI
amount fed back from BS or user.

an analysis of the performance loss caused by IRS with
phase quantization error, we considered two scenarios: LoS
and Rayleigh channels. The closed-form expressions of SNR
performance loss, AR, and BER with PL were derived using
the law of large numbers and some mathematic approximation
techniques. With the help of the Taylor series expansion, the
simple approximate performance loss expressions of IRS with
approximate quantization error were also provided. Simulation
results showed that when the number of quantization bits is
larger than or equal to 3, the performance losses of SNR and
AR are less than 0.23dB and 0.08bits/s/Hz, respectively, and
the corresponding degradation on BER is negligible. The sim-
ple approximate expression approaches the true performance
loss when the number of quantization bits is larger than or
equal to 2.
