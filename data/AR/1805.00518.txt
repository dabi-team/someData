ABSTRACT
We present high-speed optical photometric observations, spanning ∼2 years, of the
recently-discovered white dwarf pulsar AR Scorpii. The amplitudes of the orbital, spin
and beat modulations appear to be remarkably stable and repeatable over the time
span of our observations. It has been suggested that the polarized and non-polarized
emission from AR Scorpii is powered by the spin-down of the white dwarf. However,
we ﬁnd that our new data is inconsistent with the published spin-down ephemeris.
Whilst our data is consistent with a constant spin period further observations over an
extended time-base are required in order to ascertain the true spin-evolution of the
white dwarf. This may have implications for the various models put forward to explain
the energetics and evolution of AR Scorpii.

1 INTRODUCTION

AR Scorpii (hereafter AR Sco) is a 3.56h binary system con-
sisting of a rapidly spinning (Ps = 117 s) white dwarf and an
M-type main sequence companion star. It was discovered to
pulse across the electromagnetic system, from UV to radio,
dominantly at the ∼118s beat period (Marsh et al. 2016).
More recently (Takata et al. 2017) reported that the UV/X-
ray emission observed with (XMM-Newton) also shows or-
bital and beat modulations. The spectral energy distribu-
tion of AR Sco is characterized by two synchrotron power
law (Sν ∝ να) components, with the addition of the M-star
spectrum (Marsh et al. 2016) and a hot multi-temperature
thermal plasma (kT ∼ 1 − 8 keV, Takata et al. (2017)). For
radio to infrared frequencies (ν ≤ 1012 − 1013 Hz) α ∼ 1.3,
typical of self absorbed synchrotron emission. For higher fre-
quencies (ν ≥ few×1014 Hz), from optical to X-rays, α ∼ −0.2
(Marsh et al. 2016; Geng et al. 2016). Marcote et al. (2017)
and Littleﬁeld et al. (2017) report on high-angular-resolution
radio interferometric observations and long-cadence optical
observations respectively.

The optical pulsed emission was discovered to be highly
linearly polarized, up to 40%, (Buckley et al. 2017), which
led to the interpretation that AR Sco is the ﬁrst white dwarf
pulsar, with a spin period of ∼117s. Various models consist-
ing of magnetic interactions between the two stars, acceler-
ating relativistic electrons producing synchrotron radiation

and MHD interactions have been put forward to explain
the power behind the observed polarized and non-polarized
emission, e.g. Marsh et al. (2016), Buckley et al. (2017),
Takata et al. (2017), Takata et al. (2018), Geng et al. (2016)
and Katz (2017).

1.1 The white dwarf spin period

Marsh et al. (2016) report that the white dwarf in AR Sco
(cid:219)ω = −(2.86 ± 0.36) × 10−17Hz
is slowing down at a rate of
s−1. It is suggested that the source of AR Sco’s observed
luminosity comes from the spin-down power of the highly
magnetic (∼500 MG, Buckley et al. (2017)) white dwarf,
through dissipation of dipole radiation. Consequently an ac-
curate measure of the spin-down rate is important for the
understanding of the energetics and evolution of AR Sco.

We have observed AR Sco photometrically, with high-
time resolution, on multiple occasions over a timespan of ∼2
yr, between 2015 and 2017 (see Table. 1). Over this time the
total accumulated error is ∼ 20 seconds, using the quoted un-
certainties for the spin and spin-down frequencies in Marsh
et al. (2016). This is signiﬁcantly shorter than the white
dwarf spin period of ∼117s and therefore there is no ambi-
guity in the spin cycle count over our datasets.

Over the course of the two years of our dataset (2015 to
2017) the spin-down rate will result in an accumulated shift
in spin-phase of ∼0.06 equivalent to ∼7s. Our data sets have
a time resolution of ∼1s and, in addition, the spin and beat
pulses are of high-amplitude on short time scales. Therefore

it should be possible to conﬁrm the spin-down rate reported
by Marsh et al. (2016) with our new dataset.

In the next sections we present our new observations
from the 2016 and 2017 observing seasons and the results
of our period analysis combined with the 2015 observations
from Marsh et al. (2016). We show that our observations are
inconsistent with the spin-down ephemeris of Marsh et al.
(2016).

2 OBSERVATIONS

Table 1 shows a log of all the high speed photometry obser-
vations of AR Sco included in this study, which includes the
original 2015 ULTRACAM photometry reported in Marsh
et al. (2016) plus observations obtained by us at the South
African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in 2016 and
2017. Observations were made with the HI-speed Photo-
POlarimeter (HIPPO; Potter et al. (2010)) on the SAAO
1.9-m telescope.

The HIPPO was operated in its simultaneous linear and
circular polarimetry and photometry mode (all-Stokes). Un-
ﬁltered (deﬁned as ‘clear’) observations (3500-9000 ˚A, de-
ﬁned by the response of the two RCA31034A GaAs photo-
multiplier tubes), and ﬁltered observations were undertaken,
the latter using OG570 and I ﬁlters. The analysis of the
polarimetric observations will be the subject of a separate
publication.

Photometric calibrations were not carried out; photom-

etry is given as total counts. Background sky measurements
were taken at frequent intervals during the observations.

All of our observations were synchronized to GPS to
better than a millisecond. Given the high-speed nature of the
instruments, their timing accuracy has been veriﬁed through
feeding GPS pulsed LED light fed through the instruments.
We corrected all times for the light travel time to the
barycentre of the Solar system, converted to the barycentric
dynamical time (TDB) system as Barycentric Julian Date
(BJD; see (Eastman, Siverd & Gaudi 2010), for achieving
accurate absolute times and time standards). By doing this
we have removed any timing systematics, particularly due to
the unpredictable accumulation of leap seconds with UTC,
and eﬀects due to the inﬂuence of, primarily Jupiter and Sat-
urn, when heliocentric corrections only are applied. HIPPO
data reduction then proceeded as outlined in (Potter et al.
2010).

3 THE PHOTOMETRY

Fig. 1 shows our longest observation, speciﬁcally the clear-
ﬁlter HIPPO observations taken on the night of 2017 June
23/24 for a total of ∼8 hours. Clearly seen is the high am-
plitude orbital modulation covering ∼ 2.25 cycles as well as
the strong beat and spin pulses at ∼2 minutes. An expanded
view of part of the light curve can be seen in the inset re-
vealing the spin/beat pulses in more detail. This is consistent
with the observations reported by Marsh et al. (2016) and
Buckley et al. (2017).

Fig.2 shows the details of the spin and beat modula-
tions as a function of orbital phase, in the form of a 2D
colour coded image, also known as a dynamic pulse proﬁle.
The ﬁgure was constructed by phase-fold binning on the or-
bital ephemeris of Marsh et al. (2016) and the spin/beat
ephemeris derived in section 4. The best signal-to-noise
HIPPO clear ﬁltered 2016 and 2017 observations were used
to increase the signal-to-noise. The photometric orbital, spin
and beat modulations are remarkably stable and repeatable
over all our data sets. Individual data sets show the same
orbital/spin/beat 2D image albeit at lower signal-to-noise.
Both 2D images show that the double-peaked spin and
beat pulses evolve in amplitude over the orbital cycle peak-
ing at ∼0.4-0.5 in orbital phase and signiﬁcantly reduced at
orbital phase ∼0. There also appears to be a second set of
double pulses (spin and beat) between orbital phases ∼0.6-
1.0. The spin and beat pulses also appear not to be stable
in phase, i.e. the spin and beat pulses appear to drift later
and earlier respectively as a function of orbital phase, giving
the diagonal appearance. The “slopes” of the diagonal pulses
in the spin/beat-orbit phase-space is consistent with cross
“contamination” between the spin and beat frequencies.

4 FOURIER ANALYSIS

All of the photometry, listed in Table 1, were subjected to
Fourier analysis. Fig. 3 presents the amplitude spectra. We
are able to identify all of the peaks in the amplitude spectra
as a result of the orbital-spin sidebands and their harmon-
ics. Clearly seen are the multiple harmonics of the spin (ω)

and beat (ω − Ω) frequencies as well as other sideband com-
binations of the spin and orbit frequencies. The spectrum
is heavily aliased due to daily, weekly, monthly and yearly
gaps in the dataset.

Fig. 4 shows further expanded views of the amplitude
spectrum centered on the frequencies as labeled. The side-
band peaks are a result of ∼1 year aliasing. Fig. 4 shows that
the spin/beat frequencies and particularly their harmonics,
calculated from the ephemeris of Marsh et al. (2016), do not
match well to the tallest peaks of the amplitude spectrum.
This is further exempliﬁed in the top 2 panels of Fig. 6 where
the red, green and blue curves are the spin and beat folded
light curves from the separate 2015, 2016 and 2017 data sets,
respectively, where there is a clear phase oﬀset between each
successive year. The phase oﬀset between the 2015 and 2017
observations is ∼0.4 in phase, which corresponds to ∼50-60
seconds. Therefore the ephemeris of Marsh et al. (2016) is
inconsistent with our data. We stress that the ephemeris
consists of three terms: a ﬁducial date (T0), a spin frequency
(ω) and a spin frequency derivative ( (cid:219)ω). In deriving the

particularly in the top panel.

Figure 5. Black curves are magniﬁed views centered on a sam-
ple of spin and beat harmonics re-scaled in frequency space with
respect to the spin fundamental. e.g. the frequencies centered on
2ω were divided by 2. Once rescaled the black curves (including
others identiﬁed in Fig. 3 but not plotted here) were summed to
produce the red curve. All spectra have been vertically displaced
to aid visualization. The vertical solid line represents the loca-
tion of the spin and beat harmonics assuming the spin frequency
(corrected for spin down to 2015 and 2017) using the (Marsh et
al. 2016) spin ephemeris. The vertical black dashed line indicates
the location of the spin and beat harmonics using the center of
the tallest peak in the summed red spectrum.

folded light curves. Top and bottom panels used the spin-down

light curves from the separate 2015, 2016 and 2017 data sets re-
spectively. See text for details.

ephemeris all three terms are calculated simultaneously. We
note that Marsh et al. (2016) do not explicitly state the
ﬁducial date of their ephemeris, which is BMJD0 = 55000.0
expressed as a Modiﬁed Julian Day number (MJD = JD -
2400000.5) (Marsh, private communication).

Exploring our data further, Fig. 4 suggests that the
tallest peaks are located at lower frequencies than suggested
by the spin-down ephemeris of Marsh et al. (2016). How-

ever there are comparable sized peaks at several of the 1
year alias locations. Nevertheless, the amplitude spectrum
in Fig. 3 shows many sidebands and harmonics of the spin
and orbit frequencies. The most likely true spin (and beat)
frequency, amongst the aliases, will be the one that also has
corresponding high peaks amongst all the sidebands and har-
monics.

Therefore, in order to eliminate between the aliases we
ﬁrst re-scaled the frequency axis of the magniﬁed spectra in
Fig. 4. such that they co-aligned with the fundamental of the
spin frequency. For example the frequencies centered on 2ω
(the second right panel of Fig 4.) were divided by 2 and the
frequencies centered on 3(ω − Ω) (the forth left panel of Fig
4.) had Ω added then divided by 3. The black curves in Fig.
5 show 4 examples of such spectra re-scaled with respect to
the fundamental of the spin frequency. The 15 tallest am-
plitude peaks in Fig.3 were re-scaled in frequency and then
their amplitudes summed to produce the total amplitude
spectrum, shown in red in Fig 4.

Note that each sub-spectrum was normalized by its peak
amplitude before being added, otherwise the higher harmon-
ics (lower panels) would make an insigniﬁcant contribution
to the total sum despite their having good signal-to-noise
ratio. Despite there being several aliases, not all of them
have corresponding peaks at the various spin/orbit/beat
sidebands and harmonics, resulting in a reduced summed
amplitude at those frequencies. Conversely the most prob-
able frequency has peaks in all the sub-spectra and hence
has summed to produce the most signiﬁcant peak in the
total sum amplitude spectrum. Even without summing, it
is immediately apparent from Fig. 5. that the tallest peak

The multiple combinations and harmonics of the spin,
beat and orbital frequencies has enabled us to eliminate
between aliases and to derive a suﬃciently accurate spin
frequency to correctly phase all of our data sets. Our spin
ephemeris is inconsistent with the spin-down ephemeris re-
ported by Marsh et al. (2016). We suggest that the earlier
observations used in the analysis of Marsh et al. (2016) are
too sparse and of insuﬃcient time resolution to derive an
ephemeris as they reported.

Currently any spin derivative within the range ∼ (−2) −
(+1) × 10−16 Hz s−1 is undetectable given the time base of
the observations. Longer term photometric monitoring is re-
quired in order to accurately measure the spin-evolution of
the white dwarf in AR Sco essential for understanding its
energetics and evolution.

(amongst the aliases) in each sub frequency spectrum are
consistent with each other and therefore the most probable
solution amongst the aliases.

For the above we assumed the orbital frequency of
Marsh et al. (2016). We repeated the exercise of Fig. 5 for
a range of orbital frequencies (not shown). We ﬁnd that
the most signiﬁcant orbital frequency is in agreement with
Marsh et al. (2016).

We measure the spin frequency to be ω = 0.008538220(3)
Hz, where the error is measured from the width of the red
peak (Fig. 5) at half its amplitude. We phase-fold our ob-
servations using:

Φt = (BMJDt − BMJD0) × ω

(1)

expressed as a Modiﬁed Julian Day number (MJD =
JD - 2400000.5) and BMJD0 = 57530.0 corresponding to our
2016 dataset. BMJDs are ﬁrst converted to seconds.

The bottom 2 panels of Fig. 7 show the separate 2015,
2016 and 2017 data sets folded on our ephemeris and dis-
played in the same manner as the top panels. Compared
to the top 2 panels (folded on the spin-down ephemeris of
(Marsh et al. 2016)), the light curves appear well aligned
conﬁrming the frequency measured from our Fourier analy-
sis. Note that we used data between orbital phases 0.4-0.6
only, where the spin/beat pulses are the strongest and most
clearly deﬁned.

We next investigated the possibility of adding a non-
zero spin-derivative to our linear ephemeris. We used a grid
of spin and spin derivatives and for each grid point we pro-
duced 6 folded light curves (3 spin plus 3 beat) as in Fig. 6.
The 6 light curves were then cross-correlated for each grid
point.

Fig. 7 shows the results as a color coded image with
the best cross-correlation values indicated as black. The
tallest total-amplitude peak associated with the spin fre-
quency (from Fig. 5.) is also over-plotted, rotated on its side.
The solution for our constant frequency ephemeris is indi-
cated by the central cyan cross. The black region indicates
that there is a range of spin and spin-derivative combinations
that give comparable cross-correlation values to the zero
spin-derivative solution. The black region shows that there
are no spin-frequency solutions (as a result of adding a spin
derivative term) that are outside the frequency range deﬁned
by the width of the amplitude peak. However, the width
(spin-derivative axis) of the black region (∼ (−2)−(+1)×10−16
Hz s−1) indicates the range of possible spin-derivatives that
are currently “hidden” in the resolution of the data. Only by
adding more observations and thereby extending the time-
base of the dataset can this range be narrowed.

We note that we assumed the orbital frequency of Marsh
et al. (2016) in the cross-correlation analysis above (Figs. 6
and 7).

5 SUMMARY

We have obtained and analysed new high-speed photomet-
ric observations spanning 2 years between 2015 and 2017.
Repeatable spin, beat and orbital modulations are seen
throughout our dataset and are clearly deﬁned in our Fourier
analysis which displays multiple harmonics of the spin and
beat pulses as well as other multiple combinations thereof.
