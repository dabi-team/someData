Abstract: 
A statistical-type model is developed to describe the ion production and electron emission in 
collisions of (molecular) ions with atoms. The model is based on the Boltzmann population of 
the  bound  electronic  energy  levels  of  the  quasi  molecule  formed  in  the  collision  and  the 
discretized continuum. The discretization of the continuum is implemented by a free electron 
gas  in  a  box  model  assuming  an  effective  square  potential  of  the  quasi  molecule.  The 
temperature  of  the  electron  gas  is  calculated  by  taking  into  account  a  thermodynamically 
adiabatic  process  due  to  the  change  of  the  effective  volume  of  the  quasi  molecule  as  the 
system  evolves.  The  system  may  undergo  a  transition  with  a  small  probability  from  the 
discretized continuum to the states of the complementary continuum. It is assumed that these 
states  are  decoupled  from  the  thermodynamic  time  development.  The  decoupled  states 
overwhelmingly determine the yield of the asymptotically observed fragment ions. The main 
motivation  of  this  work  is  to  describe  the  recently  observed  H-  ion  production  in  OH+  +Ar 
collisions.  The  obtained  differential  cross  sections  for  H-  formation,  cation  production  and 
electron emission are close to the experimental ones. Calculations for the atomic systems O+ 
+Ar  and  H+  +Ar  are  also  in  reasonable  agreement  with  the  experiments  indicating  that  the 
model can be applied to a wide class of collisions. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

The understanding of the basic processes induced by the collisions of ions with atoms 
or  molecules  is  essential  for  modeling  the  chemical  changes  in  various  mediums,  e.g., 
astrophysical environments [1] and living matter [2]. The heavy ions of the solar wind can be 
accelerated  via  an  electromagnetic-wave–particle  interaction  mechanism  in  the  magnetized 
plasma  of  the  corona  and  reach  speeds  of  up  to  several  hundred  km/s,  which  correspond  to 
several keV energy [3]. Collisions in this energy range are important in the interaction of solar 
wind with cometary and planetary atmospheres and also in life sciences as they correspond to 
the  distal  region  of  the  Bragg-peak  [4].  The  electron  capture  processes  maximize  here, 
inducing chemical changes in living tissues and astrophysical environments [5,6]. As a result 
of  the  capture  and  ionization  processes,  ionized  molecules  are  created,  which  may  undergo 
fragmentation  processes  due  to  Coulomb-explosion  and  form  highly  reactive  radicals.  Slow 
electrons  are  also  effectively  ejected  from  the  collisions  [7].  These  electrons  efficiently 
produce single- and double-strand breaks of DNA molecules due to the dissociative electron 
attachment  (DEA)  process  leading  to  cell  death  in  radiolysis  [8].  Ordinary  perturbation 
theories  cannot  handle  atomic  or  molecular  collision  in  this  energy  range.  The  projectile 
velocities  are  well  below  one  atomic  unit,  so  the  perturbation  is  strong,  which  leads  to 
difficulties in the calculations. 

Recently the production of negative ions of hydrogen was observed in 7-keV OH+ +Ar 
collisions  [9,10].  The  H-  ions  are  able  to  form  molecules  in  collisions  with  atoms  due  to 
associative  electron  detachment  (AED).  Thus  they  play  significant  role  in  the  chemistry  of

planetary  atmospheres  and  star  formation  as  precursor  of  molecular  hydrogen  and  larger 
molecules  [11,12].  The  observed  H-  ions  in  Ref.  [9]  were  due  to  binary  collision  of  atomic 
centers  detaching  the  H  center  from  the  OH+.  It  was  unexpected  that  the  detached  center  is 
able to grab two electrons with significant probability in those violent collisions to form the 
delicate loosely-bound two-electron system of H-. However, as it was found later, this process 
is general, H- emission was observed from many other molecular species [9,13].  

As expected, effective positive hydrogen ion formation by binary collisions was also 
observed  [10].  The  ratio  of  the  fractions  (H-/H+)  in  those  experiments  was  about  1/100  and 
was independent of the observation angle, and thus, independent of the impact parameter of 
the  collision.  This  was  surprising  and  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the  different  charge  states 
were populated by some simple statistical law. This is supported by the fact that the outgoing 
channels  for  the  hydrogen  center  are  very  limited,  H+  and  H-  have  only  one  (stable)  state, 
while  the  intermediate  channels  of  the  collisional  quasi  molecule  are  quite  numerous.  The 
large number of possible transitions between the  different intermediate states may  cause the 
process to be stochastic, which leads to the statistical distribution of the final states.  

The decisive role of the  electronic excitations in the process was also shown.  In less 
violent collisions, when the impact parameter is large enough, the energy transferred to the H 
center is smaller than necessary to detach it from the molecular ion in its ground state. In such 
collisions,  when  the  scattering  angles  are  less  than  ~10°,  however,  large  H-  and  H+  yields 
were measured [10]. This indicates that the molecular ions are excited by the collision and a 
kinetic  energy  release  (KER)  separates  the  centers.  By  a  semi-classical  model  calculation, 
where KER of several eV was included, the observed energy and angular distribution of the 
positive  and  negative  ions  could  be  well  described  [10].  Also,  the  recently  observed  large 
fraction  of  negative  H-  fragment  ions  quasi-isotropically  emitted  from  H2O  target  with  low 
kinetic  energies  in  large-impact-parameter  collisions  with  O+  was  reproduced  by  the  model 
[13]. The main shortcoming of the model is that it does not give explanation for the formation 
mechanism of negative ions and the values for the relative population of the different charge 
states are taken from the experiment.  

In  Ref.  [9],  electrons  with  broad  energy  distribution  in  the  0.1-100  eV  energy  range 
were also observed. The emission shows a maximum at the low energy side and has a slowly 
decreasing high energy tale. This is a general feature of low energy ion-atom or ion-molecule 
collisions [7]. Binary collisions between the slow projectile and the target electrons cannot be 
the source of this emission since the energy of the recoiled electrons, which regarded as quasi 
free, is 0.2 eV at maximum. The observed relatively high-energy electrons may originate from 
multiple scattering sequentially on the target and projectile centers, however. This is the so-
called  Fermi-shuttle  effect  [14].  Up  to  fourfold  scattering  sequences  for  the  electrons  were 
observed  experimentally  in  C+  +  Xe  collision  in  the  MeV  energy  range  [15].  The  energy 
distribution of electrons showed wide peak structures at energies corresponding to 2V and 4V 
velocities, where V is the velocity of the projectile. The velocity of the electrons increases by 
2V  at  each  scattering  event  by  the  projectile.  In  the  keV  collision  energy  range,  these 
structures are smeared out, but classical trajectory calculations showed that the electrons may 
undergo 6−14-fold scattering sequences [16]. 

In this work, a model calculation of statistical type is presented in order to explain the 
emission of fragment ions and electrons in slow molecular collisions. The main motivation is 
to  explain  the  H-  emission  in  OH+  +Ar  collisions,  for  which  rigorous  quantum  mechanical 
approach  appears  to  be  of  prohibitive  difficulty.  The  different  electronic  levels  of  the 
collisional quasi molecule OHAr + are supposed to be populated by a statistical law during the 
collision.  In this approach, transition probabilities are not involved, which greatly simplifies 
the  calculations.  The  population  of  the  excited  levels  of  the  OHAr+  quasi  molecule  that 
dissociate  to  an  H-  ion  leads  to  the  observed  anion  formation.  The  H-  production  cross 
sections resulting from the model are close to the experimental values.  

The  outline  of  this  work  is  as  follows.  First,  the  basic  concepts  of  the  model  are 
introduced  in  section  II.  In  section  III,  the  obtained  results  are  presented  for  three  collision 
systems  in  separated  subsections.  The  results  are  compared  with  available  experimental

results.  In  section  IV,  the  conclusions  obtained  by  the  model  are  summarized.  In  the 
appendices, the details of the calculations are presented. 

II. THE THEORETICAL MODEL 

The model is presented for the OH+ + Ar system, but it may be easily generalized to 
other  molecular  or  atomic  collisions.  Atomic  units will be  used throughout  the paper  unless 
otherwise noted. 

 A semi-classical approach is adopted, in which the nuclei follow classical trajectories. 
The  model  uses  the  energy  levels  of  the  electrons,  which  are  from  ab  initio  quantum 
mechanical  calculations  or  reasonable  approximations.  Initially,  the  collision  partners  are 
separated  and  they  are  in  their  ground  state.  When  the  projectile  approaches  the  target,  the 
system  can  be  characterized  by  electronic  eigenstates  at  fixed  atomic  centers  of  the 
quasimolecular  collision  system.  In  the  course  of  the  collision,  nuclear  motion  couples  the 
different  states  and  transitions  may  occur  between  them.  The  outgoing  channels  describe 
excitation,  capture  and  ionization  processes.  Calculating  the  probability  of  the  different 
outcomes  as  a  function  of  the  impact  parameter  allows  us  to  deduce  cross  sections  for  the 
different processes.    In  ordinary  methods  to  solve the  underlying problem,  the  expansion  of 
the  time  dependent  state  vector  of  the  system  in  the  unperturbed  electronic  eigenstates  is 
performed. This leads to coupled equations for the resulting time dependent coefficients of the 
different channels. The solution of this problem may be complicated due to the large number 
of channels and the strong coupling between them.  

The basic concept of this model is different at this point. In the present treatment, it is 
assumed that the transitions between all the electronic states except some of the highly excited 
ones open up at a critical distance of approach Rcrit, and in the further development, transitions 
are  so  frequent  that  the  states  are  statistically  populated.  For  the  validity  of  this 
approximation,  it  is  necessary  that  there  is  enough  time  for  multiple  transitions  during  the 
collision process, that is, the collision is sufficiently slow. This condition may be expressed as 
Rcrit/ V >>τ, where V is the projectile velocity  and τ is the characteristic time for transitions 
between the channels, which is proportional to the inverse of the square of the corresponding 
coupling matrix element. Since the latter one is in the order of an atomic unit as well as Rcrit 
for  small  quasimolecular  collision  systems,  projectile  velocities  smaller  than  1  a.u.  are 
considered in this work. 

In such slow collisions, the scattered free electrons have enough time to undergo many 
collisions  with  the  atomic  centers  before  they  are  emitted,  giving  way  to  frequent  energy 
exchange  between  them  and  the  atomic  centers.  This  effect  contributes  to  the  statistical 
distribution  of  energies.  The  thermodynamic  equilibrium  is  expected  to be  reached  within  a 
small fraction of time of the collision. 

A schematic view of the collision with electric potential for the electrons is shown in 
Figure 1. The critical distance is taken as the classical overbarrier capture distance [17].  At 
this point, the most loosely bound electron may pass the barrier between the nuclei classically. 
Quantum  mechanically,  this  is  the  typical  distance,  where  the  wavefunctions  localized 
originally  on  the  target  or  the  projectile  expand  to  both  of  them.  This  opens  up  transitions, 
since geometrical overlap of the wavefunctions increases.

of approach the most loosely bound electron of Ar passes the barrier and becomes quasi molecular. The pseudo-

the quasi molecule. The population of the states is depicted by the Boltzmann factor.

where Ib is the binding energy of the most loosely bound electron on the neutral target, which 
in  this  case  is  the  argon  atom  and  q  is  the  charge  state  of  the  projectile.  For  the  studied 
systems,  Rcrit=5.18  a.  u.  is  obtained.  The  overbarrier  model  was  developed  for  atomic 
projectile  ions,  where  the  distance  of  approach  is  measured  from  nucleus  to  nucleus.  In  the 
case of molecular projectile, this definition is ambiguous. In the model, the H center is taken 
to be the effective charge carrier, from where this distance is measured.  

In  the  statistical  distribution  of  energies,  the  electrons  in  the  continuum  play  a 
significant  role.  In  order  to  introduce  them  in  this  model,  their  energy  levels  have  to  be 
discretized. It is plausible to assume that only those electrons in continuum interact with the 
system and  are involved in the statistical distribution of energies,  which are localized in the 
volume of the quasi molecule. The energy spectrum of such electrons, which are referred to as 
pseudo-localized free electrons (PLFE), is discrete (see Figure 1). A derivation of their energy 
levels and their energy density is presented in Appendix A. 

Due  to  the  stochastic  energy  exchange  between  the  nuclei  and  electrons,  different 

electronic states are populated with probabilities defined by the Boltzmann factor

where E is the energy of the state, T is the temperature and k is the Boltzmann constant. Be 
aware  that  in  E,  the  energy  of  the  PLFEs  as  well  as  that  of  the  bound  electronic  system  is 
included.  The resulting probabilities for populating the excited states of the quasi molecular 
system  and  the  related  statistical  quantities  like  the  expectation  value  for  the  energy  of  the 
system  are  given  in  Appendix  B.      As  the  collision  partners  approach  each  other,  the 
characterizing temperature T increases due to thermodynamically adiabatic compression. The 
equations governing the temperature are also given in Appendix B.  

In  the  way  out  of  the  collision,  the  partners  are  getting  separated  and  the 
system cools down. When the H center approaches the critical distance again, the transitions 
between the electronic states become less likely so that they practically stop. After asymptotic 
separation  of  the  centers,  certain  charge  states  of  the  atomic  centers  may  be  observed 
depending on this final state. These are expected to be mostly low charge states since the final 
temperature  is  low.  Contrary,  high  charge  states  up  to  threefold  are  observed  in  the 
experiments. Therefore one may conclude that some of the populated highly excited levels are 
coupled out from the stochastic time development and fixed earlier. This is also supported by 
the  observed  relatively  high  fraction  of  anions,  which  are  accompanied  by  emission  of 
cations.  They  are  formed  efficiently  during  the  collision  at  close  approach  of  the  collision 
partners, but the system  is likely to make a transition to the energetically favorable neutral–
neutral or neutral–cationic state in the way out of the collision both in the picture of stochastic

transitions and in coupled channel calculations. For the explanation of the observed relatively 
high  anion  production,  the  switching  off  the  stochastic  transitions  with  some  probability 
during the collision process seems to be necessary from this point of view.  

In order to explain this, the role of the active PLFEs in the stochastic transitions have 
to  be  considered.  Transitions  between  the  different  excited  levels  of  the  transient  quasi 
molecule  may  be  hampered  by  the  large  energy  difference  between  them.  The  situation  is 
different  when  a  PLFE  is  present.  The  energy  difference  can  be  taken  by  the  PLFE  since  it 
can occupy many different energy levels in the quasi continuum so that the total energy of the 
system does not change significantly. The PLFE, howewer, with a small probability can leave 
the  volume  of  the  quasi  molecule,  that  is,  the  electron  is  ejected.  Then  the  electromagnetic 
interaction between the electron and the rest of the system becomes negligible and the energy 
exchange becomes practically impossible. The quasi molecule is left in a specific state, which 
adiabatically  develops  further.  Its  energy  continuously  varies  with  the  varying  internuclear 
distance but the jumps between different energy  levels do not happen  any  more.  In order to 
demonstrate  this  some  simulations  are  performed,  which  are  presented  in  the  supplemental 
material  [18].  The  Schrödinger  equation  is  numerically  solved  for  a  particle  in  a  box  with 
walls  of  finite  heights.  The  width  of  the  box  slowly  gets  narrower  in  time  representing  the 
quasi  molecule  in  the  way  in  of  the  collision.  If  the  initial  state  is  a  bound  state  containing 
only one mode with a given wavelength, that mode remains the dominant one for a time far 
longer that 1 atomic time unit. If another particle being in a pseudo-localized free state is also 
present in the box, the other modes appear very soon, indicating that transitions between the 
different energy levels of bound states are open. 

In  the  present  statistical  model,  the  time  development  of  the  system  is  followed  in 
small discrete time steps. In each step, the position of the nuclei, the force acting on them, the 
temperature  of  the  system  and  the  probability  of  populating  the  different  excited  states  and 
PLFEs  are calculated assuming statistic distribution of the excitation energies.  It is assumed 
that when a PLFE leaves the volume of the quasi molecule the state of the remaining ionized 
quasi  molecule  is  fixed  as  explained  above,  that  is,  a  certain  state  is  branched  out  from  the 
stochastic time development. The probability of such events is calculated in Appendix C. The 
motion of the nuclei is then calculated by the adiabatic potential energy surface corresponding 
to the fixed excited state in the further time steps. Each potential surface is associated with a 
different  dissociation  limit  of  the  constituent  atomic  ions  at  far  internuclear  separation.  The 
populated charge state of the fragment ions is recorded  after the  collision letting the system 
develop  for  sufficient  time.  Many  trajectories  are simulated  with  different  initial  conditions. 
Since  the  time  developments  starting  from  a  given  initial  condition  is  the  same  up  to  the 
earliest branching point, a stochastic time development is needed to be calculated only once 
letting  it  to  be  active  for  the  whole  time  duration.  Then  selecting  some  branching  points, 
further calculations are performed that belong to the same initial condition, in order to sample 
random events of branching outs.  

The  population  of  pseudo-localized  free  states  by  the  Boltzmann  factor  and  the 
subsequent  transitions  to  unlocalized  free  states  describe  excitation  processes  to  free  states 
and  ejection  of  electrons  at  each  time  step.  The  density  of  pseudo-localized  free  states 
obtained  in  Appendix  A  allows  the  determination  of  the  energy  distribution  of  the  ejected 
electrons. The populated free states are expected to be s waves, since in these slow collisions, 
the angular momentum of the electrons is not expected to take high values. This again limits 
the  validity  of  the  model  to  low  velocities.  The  s-waves  are  expected  to  be  centered  on  the 
different  scattering  centers,  the  nuclei  and  free  electrons.  Considering  this,  the  angular 
distribution of the emitted electrons can be determined (see Appendix D).  

The  excitation  into  free  states  may  be  referred  to  as  evaporation  of  electrons,  which 
appeared  in  the  model  of  Russek  [19]  for  ionization  in  atomic  collisions.  The  source  of  the 
excitation energy was supposed to be a friction mechanism due to electron-electron collisions. 
This energy was statistically divided in uniform energy cells representing the energy levels of 
the  atoms  and  the  continuum.  With  two  fitting  parameters,  a  good  agreement  was  obtained 
with  the  experimentally  observed  charge  states  distribution  of  ions  following  Ar++Ar 

5 

 
 
collisions.  In a developed version of the model, the friction mechanism was replaced by the 
excitation to discrete levels of autoionizing states which depends on the  closest approach of 
nuclei [20]. Later, the model was further developed.  Phase-space cells were used instead of 
energy  cells.  Using  an  adjusting  parameter  for  the  transitional  matrix  elements,  a  better 
agreement  was  found  for  the  final  charge  state  distribution  [21].  Other  different  statistical 
approaches for atomic collisions were also developed [22,23]. 

In the present model, ab initio electronic energy levels of diatomic molecules are used 
instead  of  energy  cells.  The  potential  surfaces  of  the  triatomic  system  are  approximated  by 
sum of diatomic potentials. Sometimes screened charged potential approximation is used if ab 
initio  potentials  are  not  available.  More  on  the  used  potential  curves  can  be  found  in 
Appendix E.   In the calculations, some atomic levels corresponding to different dissociation 
limits are excluded. Since it is not likely that the angular momentum of the bound electrons 
increases  in  slow  collisions,  the  atomic  levels  with  J>4  are  excluded.  Energy  levels  lying 
higher than certain energy limit above the ground state, high energy cut limit (HECL) in the 
following,  are  also  excluded  in  order  to  avoid  population  of  infinite  number  of  levels 
approaching  the  continuum.  This  is  justified  if  one  considers  that  highly  excited  (Rydberg) 
states  are  expanded  in  space,  so  that  they  cannot  be  considered  as  localized  to  the  quasi 
molecule.  Their  overlaps  with  low  lying  states  are  small,  therefore  the  transition  times  may 
exceed the collisional time. Since the characteristic radii (4 a. u.) of the 2s and 2p orbitals of 
hydrogen (2l level in the following) are relatively large, it is assumed that the 2l level should 
be excluded. This level is just above 10 eV excitation energy, which is, therefore, accepted as 
a  common  HECL  leading  to  results  in  good  agreement  with  the  experimental  ones.  Unless 
otherwise  noted,  the  10  eV  HECL  is  used  in  the  presented  results  in  section  III.  The 
autoionizing  states  are  skipped  merely  to  save  computation  time.  Since  they  are  highly 
excited, they are not effectively populated by moderate thermal processes. Despite their low 
population, their contributions can be observed in the experimental energy spectra, since they 
emit electrons in narrow peaks 

 No adjusting parameters like in the Russek model [19-21] are involved in the present 
model.  The  ion  production  and  electron  emission  cross  sections  obtained  for  the  OH+  +Ar 
collisions,  as  well  as  for  the  atomic  collision  systems  of  H+  +  Ar  and  O+  +  Ar  are  in  good 
agreements with the experiments. This indicates that the model can be applied to a wide class 
of  collisions  without  system  dependent  adjusting  parameters.  Moreover,  it  is  possible  to 
simulate coincidence events with the model. 

III. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 

In  this  section  the  results  obtained  for  three  collision  systems  are  presented  and 
compared  with  experimental  results  from  the  literature.  Since  the  calculations  are  of  high 
computation demands, only sparse sampling in angle and energy are feasible. The theoretical 
results of this work are, therefore, represented by symbols, while the experiments sometimes 
are denoted by lines since the sampling was dense in the experiments. 

A. The OH++Ar system 

The calculations for OH++Ar collisions have been performed with HECLs of 10 and 
12  eV.  In  the  former  case,  only  the  ground  state  is  included  for  the  atomic  hydrogen,  since 
energy  of  the  2l  level  (10.2  eV)  is  above  the  limit. With the  higher  cut  limit,  the  2l  level is 
also included.  

In Figure 2, the results obtained for H- and H+ production cross sections using the 10 
eV HECL are shown and compared with the experimental results from Ref. [9-10] for 7-keV 
collision energy as function of the observation angle. The calculated values agree reasonably 
well with the measured data. However, significant statistical errors occur in the calculation as 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it can be seen from the non-monotonous decrease of the obtained H- production cross section 
above 60°.  The analysis shows that the errors stems from the relatively spare sampling of the 
random orientation of the primary OH+.  

The  calculation  has  been  performed  for  one  thousand  impact  parameters  all  with 
different  random  orientation  of  the  primary  projectile.  For  each  impact  parameter,  one 
hundred branching outs are modeled. The process has been repeated once more. The resulting 
ion production cross sections for the two runs agree within a factor of 2 except for one data 
point. In the Figure 2, the average of the two results is shown. The statistical errors are larger 
than  those  expected  from  the  number  of  the  simulated  events.  The  fact  that  only  the  initial 
orientation of the projectile was different in the two runs implies that the process is sensitive 
for  the  initial  orientation  of  the  OH+  projectile.  For  atomic  ion  projectiles,  where  no 
orientation is involved, the statistical errors are significantly smaller as it is obvious from the 
obtained results shown in the next subsections. 

In  average,  the  calculations  overestimate  the  H-  production  cross  section  by  about  a 
factor of 2 and underestimate H+ production by about a factor 1.5. With the 12 eV HECL, the 
obtained  angular  dependences  (not  shown  here)  are  similar,  but  the  H-  production  is 
underestimated  by  a  factor  of  about  8.  This  is  probably  due  to  the  fact  that  the  relative 
statistical weight for H- is significantly decreased with the inclusion of the first excited state 
of H.

earlier works of  the author et al. [9,10]; solid lines are two body H scattering calculations on Ar multiplied by 
fitting factors indicated in the figure, also from Ref. [9-10]. 

In Figure 3, the calculated electron emission cross section differential with respect 
to the energy  and angle  are shown.  In the 0.2-100 eV emission energy  range, the calculated 
results using the 10-eV HECL are in good agreement with the experimental ones [9] except in

some  narrow  energy  ranges.  In  the  case  of  the  12-eV  energy  cut  limit,  the  calculations 
resulted in values lower by a factor of up to 3.5 between 20 and 100 eV.   

In order to explain the partial deviations, it should be noted that the experimental 
results measured by an electrostatic spectrometer have rather large uncertainties below 1 eV 
(not shown in Ref. [9]). There is also an instrumental effect at small observation angles below 
60°,  at  which  angles  the  scattered  projectiles  may  enter  the  spectrometer.  This  leads  to 
elevated  background  in  the  spectra,  particularly  visible  above  100  eV,  where  the  signal  is 
weak. 

An  MNN  Auger-line  of  Ar  is  prominently  present between  10  and  20  eV  in  the 
experimental energy spectra. This feature cannot be reproduced with the present model since 
the autoionizing states are excluded from the calculation.

 Energy of electrons (eV)

Figure  3  Electron  emission  cross  sections  differential  with  respect  to  energy  and  angle  for  7-keV  OH+  +  Ar 
collisions at different observation angles indicated in the figure. For graphical reasons the spectra are multiplied 
by factors indicated next to the observation angles. Open squares: this work with HECL of 10 eV; closed circles: 
this work with HECL of 12 eV; solid thick lines the experimental results from the earlier work of the author et 
al. [9]. Symbols are connected to guide the eye. 

The analysis of the trajectories shows that a large fraction of the emitted is due to such 
collisions  where  the  oxygen  atom  suffers  a  close  impact  parameter  collision  with  the  target 
atom.  The  enhanced  electron  emission  is  due  to  the  higher  temperature  of  electron  system 
reached in such collisions as it is demonstrated in Figure 4. The temperature is expressed as 
energy  E=kT  in  units  of  electron  volts  (eV)  in  the  following.  When  both  projectile  centers 
pass the target relatively far from it (a), the temperature increases up to 4 eV. In the case when 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the H center approaches significantly closer (b), while the oxygen is still far, the temperature 
moderately increases up to 6 eV. However, when the oxygen center suffers a close collision 
with  the  target  (b),  the  maximum  of  the  temperature  reaches  28  eV.  According  to  the 
calculation,  in  the  latter  cases,  the  ionization  degree  reaches  4,  while  in  the  former  cases  it 
does  not  exceed  1.  The  high  temperature  favors  for  the  population  of  highly  excited  states 
such as the ionic H-−O+ channels. The impact parameter of the O center depends on the initial 
orientation  of  the  projectile.  This  is  the  explanation  why  the  population  of  ionic  states  is  so 
sensitive to the orientations.  

The analysis of the final charge states shows that in close collision by the O center, the 
most likely outgoing channel leading to H- formation is the (e-, H-, O+, Ar2+) one. In the case 
when the oxygen does not suffer a  close  collision, H- is also  formed by the weaker but still 
significant channel, the (H-, O+, Ar+) one. This outgoing channel is one of those channels that 
couple out from the stochastic development at the critical distance and do not involve electron 
emission.  Such  channels  could  be  identified  by  coincidence  techniques,  but  no  such 
experiments  have  been  performed  so  far.  A  comparison  of  the  theory  with  coincidence 
experiments may be a subject of a future work.  

All together, good agreement with the experiment is obtained for this collision system 
in both electron and ion emission for collision velocity of 0.13 atomic unit and with HECL of 
10 eV.

Time (a.u.)

Figure 4 Temperature of the electron system as a function of the time for 7-keV OH+ + Ar collisions at different 
impact parameters bO for oxygen and bH for hydrogen as indicated in the figure. The starting point of the time is 
when the H center is at a distance of  5.18 a.u. from the target center. In the vertical axis, 1 eV corresponds to 
11605 K. 

B. The O++Ar system 

The calculation for this system has been performed for 50-keV collision energy. This 
energy  corresponds  to  a  velocity  of  0.35  a.u.,  which  is  still  below  the  upper  limit  of  the 
validity  of  the  model.  In  Table  1,  the  total  experimental  ion-production  cross  sections  are 
compared with the calculated ones using the HECL of 10 eV. For single electron capture (O0 
production),  they  agree  within  the  experimental  uncertainties.  The  single  electron  loss  (O2+ 
production)  cross  section  is  underestimated  by  factor  of  1.4.  For  double  electron  loss  (O3+ 
production), experimental result is not available at this energy. An estimated value is obtained 
from the experimental results by extrapolation in energy. The theoretical value underestimates 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this  by  a  factor  of  about  4.  This,  however,  does  not  exclude  the  possibility  of  better 
agreement. 

 Significant  disagreement  has  been  found  for  negative  ion  production,  which  is 
underestimated by more than one order of magnitude. The simplest outgoing channel leading 
to O- formation is the O- + Ar2+ one. Ab initio potential energy curves for this channel are not 
available. Instead, approximate screened-charge potentials are used, which likely overestimate 
the exact potentials of bounding orbitals. The overestimated potential energy may explain the 
low population of the negative oxygen ions in the calculation.

In  Figure  5  (a),  the  calculated  differential  cross  sections  for  ion  productions  are 
presented  as  a  function  of  the  observation  angle.  It  is  seen  that  each  charge  state  follows 
nearly the same angular dependence as one may expect from the statistical characteristics of 
the model. Differential experimental results are not available in the literature. 

 In  panel  (b)  of  Figure  5,  the  charge  state  distribution  is  shown  at  30°  observation 
angle, where also the results obtained for the HECL of 13 eV are shown. The latter results are 
nearly the same as those belonging to the HECL of 10 eV except for O0 charge state, which is 
significantly  enhanced.  The  reason  behind  this  is  that  there  are  many  levels  for  this  charge 
state between 10 and 13 eV so that their inclusion increases the statistical weight for neutrals.

Double  differential  cross  sections  for  electron  emission  are  shown  in  Figure  6.  The 
results of the calculations are presented for 10 and 13 eV HECLs, too. They nearly agree with 
each other above the emission energy of 10 eV. Below this energy, the former ones slightly 
exceed  the  latter  ones.  Between  20  and  100  eV,  a  good  agreement  with  the  experimental 
results [27] is found. Note that prominent Auger lines are visible between 10 and 20 eV (Ar 
MNN) and between 150 and 250 eV (Ar LMM) in the experimental spectra. These lines are 
absent in the theoretical spectra, since the model does not calculate the contribution due to the 
10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Auger process. At forward angles, the slopes of the theoretical curves are slightly smaller than 
the slopes of the experimental cross sections. 

 It should be noted that Ref. [27] reports on a remarkable feature that the cross sections 
slightly increase from 90° going towards larger backward angles. The origin of this feature is 
still under question. One key factor in this may be the fact that oxygen is significantly lighter 
than  argon.  Therefore,  the  oxygen  center  recoiled  at  small  impact  parameters  moves 
backwards  with  respect  to  its  initial  velocity.  In  the  present  model,  enhanced  electron 
emission at backward angles may be expected due to the backscattered oxygen center, which 
grabs electrons with itself. In the results of present calculation, however, no increasing cross 
sections towards large angles was obtained.

In Figure 7, a comparison with the previously investigated OH+ + Ar system is made 
for the electron emission cross sections at 90° observation angle. Both theory and experiment 
show that for the atomic O+ projectile, the electron emission cross sections are significantly 
higher  than  for  the  molecular  projectile  OH+  at  emission  energies  between  20  and  100  eV.  
One may suppose that the reason behind this is the higher collision energy. In order to check 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this, a calculation has been performed for OH+ projectile with 53 keV, which corresponds to 
the same projectile velocity as that for 50-keV O+. Despite the same velocity, the calculated 
cross sections are significantly lower in the case of molecular projectile. The results for 7- and 
53-keV  OH+,  however,  nearly  match.  This  demonstrates  that  the  collision  energy  is  not  the 
decisive  parameter  for  the  intensity  of  electron  emission.  The  electron  emission  rather 
depends on the type of the projectile.

Figure 7 Electron emission cross sections at 90° observation angle for different systems (7- and 53-keV OH++Ar 
and  50-keV  O++Ar)  indicated  in  the  figure.  Solid  thick  lines  belong  to  experiments  [9,  27].  Symbols  denote 
calculations. They are connected to guide the eye. Full circles with connected with dashed lines are the results 
for 53-keV OH+ + Ar collisions. Open circles belong to 7-keV OH+ + Ar collisions, and closed squares belong to 
50-keV O+ + Ar collisions. 

The more intensive electron emission at large emission energies in the case of atomic 
projectile may be caused by the higher electron temperatures. In Figure 8, it is shown that for 
O+ + Ar collisions, indeed higher temperatures are obtained in the calculations. For a collision 
with impact parameter of 1 a.u. (b), the maximum of the temperature reaches 30 eV, while for 
the  OH+  +  Ar  system  similar  collisions  by  the  oxygen  leads  to  only  6  eV  at  maximum,  see 
Figure  4(b).  According  to  the  model,  the  higher  electron  temperature  in  the  case  of  atomic 
projectile is caused by the higher volume compression ratio of the quasimolecular system. In 
the  model,  the  volume,  where  the  electrons  move  quasi  freely,  is  proportional  to  the 
internuclear  distance.  For  atomic  projectile,  this  can  be  as  small  as  0.1  a.u.  at  the  closest 
approach. While in the case of OH+ projectile, even when one of the centers approaches the 
target,  the  other  center  is  likely  to  be  still  relatively  far  from  the  colliding  centers.  This 
practically does not allow the sum of internuclear distances to decrease below a limit, which 
is about twice of the bound length of OH+. This limitation of the compressed volume of the 
quasimolecular system leads to lower adiabatic heating.  

The temperature of the  electron  gas during the collision process also depends on the 
shape  potential  energy  curves  of  the  bound  states.  Therefore,  the  electronic  structure  of  the 
colliding atoms is expected to play a significant role in the intensity of electron emission, too.

a.u. from the target center at the beginning. In the vertical axis, 1 eV corresponds to 11605 K. 

C. The H++Ar system 

Collisions for this system have been modeled with impact energies of 1 and 5 keV for 
which experimental data are available. These energies correspond to velocities of 0.2 and 0.45 
a.u. respectively. 

 Single differential cross sections for H- and H0 production in the 0–5° angular range 
are  presented  in  Figure  9  (a)  and  (b)  for  1  and  5  keV  collision  energies,  respectively.  The 
theoretical results obtained with the 10 eV HECL are shown.  

For 1 keV collision energy, the theoretical result for the H0 production cross section is 
close to experimental one [28] in the 0–1° angular range. At angles larger than 1°, the cross 
section is somewhat overestimated. Compared to the experimental H- cross section measured 
by Martinez et al. [29], the present calculation leads to an overestimation in the whole range 
by about a factor of 5, see Figure 9 (a). 

 For 5 keV collision energy (panel (b) in Figure 9), a better agreement has been found. 
Both  the  calculated  H0  and  H-  production  cross  section  are  close  to  the  experimental  ones. 
Significant deviations appear only above 2–3°. The bumps at 3.1° are artifact. This scattering 
angle corresponds to the closest approach of the nuclei of about 0.7 au. In the fitted potential 
energy curves there are some artificial crossings at this internuclear distance, which is close to 
the  limit  of  the  range  of  the  available  data.  There,  the  potential  energy  curves  closely 
approach each other so that even a small change of the potentials can lead to crossings. The 
calculation  shows  that  passing  through  such  crossings  leads  to  increased  temperature  of  the 
electronic  system,  causing  higher  populations  of  excited  states  and  enhanced  electron 
emission. 

The  overestimation  of  H-  production  at  1  keV  may  stem  from  the  exclusion  of  2l 
levels  of  atomic  hydrogen  by  the  HECL  of  10  eV.  This  reduces  the  population  of  neutral 
states partly in the favor of negative hydrogen ion population. The inclusion of 2l level indeed 
decreases  the  population  of  H-  and  moderately  increases  that  of  H0  as  the  calculations  with 
HECL of 12 eV indicates, (not shown in the figure). The decrease of the H- cross section is, 
however,  dramatic.  It  becomes  about  one  order  of  magnitude  smaller  than  the  experimental 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
one. This suggests that the 2l level is active, but its population is lower than that expected at 
thermodynamical equilibrium. It may be due to the low transition rates from the other levels. 
It  is  likely  that  this  level,  though  appreciably  populated,  does  not  reach  thermodynamical 
equilibrium  during  the  time  of  the  collision.  For  faster  collisions,  its  population  likely 
becomes  negligible  due  to  the  shorter  available  time.  This  is  supported  by  the  fact  that  the 
theory  gives  nearly  correct  cross  sections  at  the  collision  energy  of  5  keV  without  the 
inclusion of 2l level.

Closed symbols denote the experimental values of Alarcon and Martinez et al. [28,29]. 

In  Table  2,  total  ion  production  cross  sections  determined  in  Ref.  [28]  and  [29]  by 
integration  of  the  measured  single  differential  cross  sections  over  the  solid  angle  are 
compared  with the results of the present calculations. The total cross sections in the present 
work are determined by a different method. The ion production probabilities multiplied by the 
cross sectional areas are integrated over the impact parameter. The so obtained cross sections 
are  higher  than  the  experimental  ones  for  both  H-  and  H0  at  5  keV  collision  energy.  This  is 
somewhat puzzling, since the differential results are in good agreement, see Figure 9 b. Note 
that, bumps at 3.1° have little contribution to the total cross sections so that it cannot explain 
the  difference.  The  high  peaks  at  zero  degree,  however,  have  significant  contribution  to  the 
total cross sections and are significantly higher in the calculations.

In  a  recent  theoretical  work  [30],  total  H0  production  cross  section  was  found  to  be 
close  to  the  experimental  values,  but  the  obtained  H-  production  cross  section  significantly 
overestimated the experimental ones. These results were obtained by calculating the classical 
trajectories  of  the  active  electrons  in  the  quasi  molecule.  The  electrons  were  treated 
independently  without  interaction  between  them.  In  this  classical  description,  the  ionization 
potential of the H- ion was significantly overestimated. This led to the overestimation of the 
H- production. In the present model the ionization potentials of the H- ion are discrete values 
obtained  from  the  literature.  This  eliminates  the  drawbacks  that  emerge  in  the  classical 
trajectory  calculations.  The  presently  obtained  total  H-  production  cross  sections  are 
somewhat  closer  to  the  experimental  ones.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  the  differential 
cross  sections  may  be  divergent  at  0°,  which  makes  the  accurate  determination  of  the  total 
cross sections difficult both in theory and experiment. 

Double differential cross sections for electron emission are presented in Figure 10 for 
three observation angles. The theoretical results obtained with the HECL of 10 eV are shown. 
Experimental data measured in two laboratories for this system [31, 32] are also shown in the 
figure. The calculated cross sections are close to the experimental ones in magnitude, but the 
shape  of  the  curves  are  somewhat  different.  Significant  deviations  can  be  observed  only 
below  1  eV  at  90°.  Here  the  experiments  are  less  reliable,  as  indicated  by  the  fact  that  the 
experimental results also deviate from each other below 5 eV. The present results do not seem 
to favor any of the experiments, partial agreements are found for both. Inaccuracies expected 
in the calculations, too, due to the artificial potential curve crossings that cause also the bumps 
in Figure 9 (b).

IV. Conclusions 

A  statistical-type  model  is  developed  in  order  to  describe  the  differential  ion-
production  and  electron-emission  cross  sections  in  collisions  of  molecular  ions  with  atoms. 
The internal dynamics of the quasi molecular system formed in the collision is approximated 
by adiabatic heating of the electrons and the Boltzmann distribution of the electronic energy 
levels. The energy levels above the continuum are discretized by confining the electrons to the 
volume of the quasi molecule. The electrons may undergo a transition with a small probability 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from the discretized continuum to the states of the complementary continuum.  It is assumed 
that  due  to  this  process  the  rest  of  the  quasi  molecular  system  is  coupled  out  from  the 
statistical  dynamics.    Population  of  the  out-coupled  states  overwhelmingly  determines  the 
yield of the observed outgoing ions.  

The theoretically challenging anion production from molecular cations can be handled 
in  the  model  without  complications.  For  7-keV  OH+  +  Ar  collisions,  the  calculated  anion 
production  cross  sections  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  experimental  data.  A  good 
performance of the model is observed also for the cation and electron emission cross sections. 
The obtained energy and angular dependences are very similar to the experimental ones. The 
angular distribution of the emitted H+ and H- ions are found to be similar to each other both in 
the  theory  and  in  the  experiment  indicating  that  the  present  statistical  model  gives  a  correct 
account  and  explanation  for  the  observed  statistical  behavior  of  final  charge  states  found  in 
Ref. [10]. The good agreement in ion production for small angles, which corresponds to large 
impact parameter collisions, where the pure binary process is not able to break the molecular 
projectile, indicates that the thermal process in the present model describes the disintegration 
of the projectile by excitations. The kinetic energy released in this process is not only due to 
the excitation energy, but the pressure of the quasi free electron gas contributes to it, too.  

 For collision systems with atomic ion projectiles of O+ and H+ colliding on Ar, a good 
agreement with the experiments is found in both dependences and magnitude. This indicates 
that  the  model  can  be  applied  for  different  systems.  The  magnitude  of  the  cross  sections  is 
close  to  the  experimental  ones  except  for  the  anion  formation  from  O+  and  from  1-keV  H+ 
projectiles. The discrepancies may partly be due to inaccuracies in the applied pair potential 
curves.  More  complete  ab  initio  potential  dataset  is  desirable  to  perform  more  accurate 
calculations.  

 It is supposed in the model that the transition rate between the different energy 
levels  is  significant  only  up  to  a  certain  excitation  energy,  and  only  the  levels  below  are 
populated according to the Boltzmann distribution. The results with the energy limit (HECL) 
of  10  eV  are  in  reasonable  agreement  with  the  experiments  for  almost  all  of  investigated 
systems. The only exception is the 1-keV H+ + Ar system, where the population of the levels 
just  above  this  limit  is  found  to  be  non–negligible  but  less  than  in  thermodynamic 
equilibrium.  The  calculations  with  higher  HECLs  (12-13  eV),  however,  have  led  to  poorer 
agreement  for  each  system.  A  better  thumb  rule  for  the  transition  rates  based  on  ab  initio 
calculations and more sophisticated selection of the effectively populated states may improve 
the quality of the calculations.  

It  is  shown  that  the  temperature  of  the  electron  gas  is  higher  for  atomic  ion  –  atom 
than for molecular ion – atom collisions due to the larger adiabatic compression in the case of 
atomic  collisions.  This  leads  to  more  intensive  electron  emission  in  accordance  with  the 
experiment. Also it has been found that close collisions of O+ on Ar result in more intensive 
electron emission than the similar collisions with H+ projectiles. 

In the future the model may be applied for larger collision systems in interest such as 
O+ + H2O [13]. Also, anion and cation production from carbon and metal clusters colliding on 
atoms  attracted  considerable  attention  recently  [33-36].  The  experimental  results  were 
interpreted in terms of statistical and thermodynamic models of fragment  emission from the 
hot  excited  clusters  after  the  collisions.  One  of  the  challenging  tasks  in  those  models  is  the 
determination of the excitation energy of the clusters after the collisions. The present model 
may be used to calculate the excitation energies of small clusters induced by atomic collisions 
as well as the fragmentation during the collision.

APPENDIX A: DENSITY OF THE STATES OF THE FREE ELECTRONS  

Treating the continuum electronic states is a fundamental problem in quantum 
mechanical  calculations.  For  feasible  calculations,  the  discretization  of  the  continuum  is 
necessary. Several methods were developed for this purpose using the so called pseudo states. 
These  are  orthogonal  states,  which  are  constructed from  finite  set  of  basis  functions  [37]  or 
obtained by the integration of eigenfuntions over disjoint intervals of the continuous positive 
energy spectrum [38,39]. The latter method may implement limitation on the wavefunction in 
space  according  to  the  Heisenberg  uncertainty  relation.  The  choice  of  the  pseudo  states  is, 
however, not unique, which leads to uncertainties in the calculations. 

 In the present model, a similar but more intuitive method is followed, which gives the 
condition  for  appropriate  selection  of  pseudo  states.  The  method  is  confining  the 
wavefunction of the free states corresponding to certain energy eigenvalues to the size of the 
quasi molecule. The selection of the eigenvalues is performed such that the resulting system 
of  wavefunctions  could  be  orthonormalized.  This  allows  only  discrete  energy  eigenvalues. 
The confining is performed by truncating the wavefunctions outside the volume of the quasi 
molecule.  The  resulting  states  are  referred  to  as  pseudo-localized  states  and  the  electrons 
being in those states as PLFEs (see Figure 1 and Figure 11). This method is justified by the 
following  reasons:  The  quasi  molecule  acts  as  an  effective  potential  valley  for  the  electrons 
trying  to  confine  them  as  a  box.  On  the  other  hand,  the  electron  emission  is  expected  to 
proceed  in  two  steps.  Initially,  the  pseudo-localized  states  are  populated,  which  have  large 
overlap with the bound states.  

Transitions directly to other free states, which spread in the whole space, are unlikely 
because  of  the  lack  of  significant  overlap  with  the  bound  states.  The  wavefunctions  of  the 
states  complementary  to  the  pseudo-localised  states  are  truncated  inside  the  quasi  molecule. 
These are referred to as unlocalized free states in the following. This way the Hilbert space of 
free electrons is divided to an active and a non-active part, which simplifies the description of 
ionization processes.  

The calculation of the exact energy levels of the PLFEs is complicated. Since they are 
expected to be spaced densely, they may be approximated by a quasi continuous distribution. 
The model requires only a good approximation for the density of states. It is supposed that the 
electrons move freely along the lines connecting the nuclear centers in an effective potential. 
The potential of quasi molecule is modeled by a square potential (see Figure 11). The width of 
effective potential well L  is taken to be the sum of the distance of the atomic centers plus 1 
atomic  unit  taking  into  account  approximately  the  width  of  the  potential  of  the  atoms 
L=ROH+1+RArH+1+RArO+1. The effective depth of the potential is denoted by Veff. As shown, 
one  can  consider  the  following  types  of  wavefunctions  for  free  electrons  in  such  potential 
shape. In the general case, the wavefunctions with definite positive kinetic energies expand to 
the whole space and have a sinusoidal shape with different wavelength inside and outside the 
box, see Figure 11 (a). Due to the continuity of the derivative, the amplitude within the well 
may  be  smaller  than  outside.  These  states  have  small  geometrical  overlap  with  the  bound 
states, therefore the probability of transitions between them is small. As a consequence, they 
are not directly populated by the thermal energy  exchange. Wavefunctions of the other type 
are such that the part outside the box is cut down, see Figure 11 (b). These may be realized by 
appropriate superposition of the wavefunctions of the former type. The corresponding states, 
the pseudo-localized states, after normalization, have large overlaps with the bound states, so 
that frequent transitions are expected to occur between them. They contain many components 
of  different  wavelengths,  but  the  expectation  value  of  their  energy  is  determined  by  the 
wavelength inside the box.

is valid, where N is an integer, which gives the number of energy levels up to the energy ε.  
Those energy levels, however, are not necessarily positive, so the corresponding states do not 
belong  to  the  continuum.  In  order  to  have  wave  functions  in  the  continuum  of  type  (b)  a 
common phase factor is applied to the wave functions given by (A1)

on the other n-1 free electrons. With each scattering center, a series of states defined by (A2) 
is associated.  

APPENDIX B: STATISTICAL QUANTITIES 

The method for calculating the different quantities of interest as population of energy 
levels, the ionization degree and the mean internal energy for the quasi molecule etc. during 
the thermodynamically stochastic time development is given here.  

The  system  at  ionization  level  n  is  divided  into  two  components:  1)  n  free  electrons 
being in pseudo-localized states and 2) the atomic centers with the bound electrons. The free 
electrons are labeled by j. Each of them has energy εj. The subsystem 2) has an energy of En,i, 
where  n  denotes  the  degree  of    ionization  and  i  corresponds  to  the  level  of  excitation.  The 
energy of the total system is

The  probability  of  population  of  an  excited  state  indexed  by  n  and  i  is  given  by  the

continuous distribution, integration is used instead of a sum:

where g(εj)  is  the  density  of  states  given  by  (A5).  The  division  by  n!  is  applied  because  all 
possible permutations of εj’s establish the same state since electrons are indistinguishable. It is 
necessary for the validity of (B2) that the energies of the free electrons should be independent. 
This is a plausible condition, since except binary collisions free electrons weakly interact with 
each other. The effects of Pauli’s exclusion principle are neglected here, since the occupancy 
of  the  pseudo  states  is  expected  to  be  much  smaller  than  unity.    Simplification  and 
normalization of expression (B2) leads to

 and thereby Z, too, would be divergent. This shows that for a realistic

This is the usual expression in equipartition theorem for the average kinetic energy per degree 
of freedom. It should be noted that in the model the motion of the electrons is restricted along 
the lines connecting the nuclei. Therefore the electrons have one degree of freedom.  

The internal energy of the system is the mean value of the energy,

En,i  depends  on  the  internuclear  separation  as  well  as  pn,i,  which  also  depends  on  the 
temperature. 

In order to determine the change of the temperature as function of time the motion of 
the nuclei is followed in small time steps defined later. First, the change of the temperature of 
the free electrons (subsystem 1) is determined when the internuclear separation coordinates R1 
is changed to R2 by a small step while switching off the interaction with the rest of the system. 
R  is  a  general  coordinate  including  all  the  internuclear  separation  distances  R=(ROH,  RArH, 
RArO).  According  to  thermodynamics,  the  free  electron  gas  adiabatically  heats  up  as  the 
volume V1, where the electron can freely move is decreased to V2. The initial temperature T1 
increases to

where f is the degree of freedom of the electrons, which equals to 1, since the motion of the 
electrons is essentially one dimensional in the quasi molecule. The volumes V1,2 are supposed 
to be proportional to L1,2, which corresponds to the picture that the electrons can move freely 
along  the  lines  connecting  the  nuclear  centers.  The  volume  ratio  therefore  can  be  expressed 
with the internuclear distances. The mean energy of the electrons increases due to the increase 
of the temperature. The energy of the rest of the system also changes due to the changes in the 
potential  energies.  The  populations  of  the  energy  levels  of  subsystem  2)  are  kept  fixed  as  a 
first order approximation. The total internal energy after the small change of the coordinates

potential energy surfaces of the different states. The second term can be identified as a force 
due  to  the  pressure  of  the  free  electron  gas.  Since  the  population  of  the  energy  levels  is 
statistical, some statistical deviations from the resulting trajectories of the atomic centers are 
expected.  However,  it  is  expected  that  the  rapid  change  of  the  populations  averages  out  the

 The initial temperature of the system is determined by the initial energy of the system 
if  it  is  in  an  excited  state.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  ground  state  corresponds  to  zero 
temperature,  which  is  not  allowed  if  one  concerns  a  thermodynamically  adiabatic  process. 
Therefore, if the system is in the ground state by the ansatz, the internal energy is taken to be 
that of the lowest excited state assuming that this is the most likely state to be populated when 
the  transitions  open  up  at  nuclear  separation  Rcrit.  This  initial  energy  is  then  thermalized  so 
that the expectation value of the internal energy should be equal to it. The initial temperature 
is numerically determined by the equation

In Figure 12, example trajectories corresponding to the stochastic development of the 
system and also corresponding to the time development after branching out are presented. At 
branching  out,  one  of  the  excitation  levels  of  the  quasi  molecule  is  fixed  with  some

sufficient  number  of  sampling,  a  good  account  for  the  development  of  the  most  likely 
outgoing channels can be achieved. With a calculated probability given by the next appendix, 
a  time  step  is  selected  when  the  branching  out  occurs  and  also  a  fixed  excitation  level  is 
selected by the probability (B3). The subsequent motion of the centers is calculated according 
to  the  force  given  by  the  corresponding  potential  energy  surface  of  the  selected  excitation 
level

is  the  number  of  events  in  which  the  regarded  ion  is  emitted  with  an  angle  falling  into  the 
binning interval ±∆θ/2 around the observation angle θ. Sometimes a non-uniform binning is 
used in order to have sufficient statistics at each angle. 

APPENDIX C: PROBABILITY OF BRANCHING OUT 

As model conjeture, the fixing of a certain state of the quasi molecule happens when at 
least  one  electron  escape  from  it.  This  process  may  be  identified  as  a  transition  to  an 
unlocalized  free  state.  It  is  not  feasible  to  calculate  by  strict  quantum  mechanics  the 
probability  of  such  transitions.  But  good  approximation  can  be  obtained  classically.  It  is 
assumed  that  initially,  the  free  electrons  are  evenly  distributed  within  the  size  of  the  quasi 
molecule,  which  is  modeled  now  by  a  sphere  for  simplicity  with  radius  of  r=(L/3)  (see 
Appendix A). The thermally distributed free electrons have a velocity distribution of

Here  spherical  symmetry  is  assumed,  since  only  s-waves  are  expected  to  be  populated. 
Furthermore,  the  velocities  of  the  atomic  centers,  which  may  shift  the  centers  of  these 
distributions,  are  neglected  here,  since  they  are  much  less  than  1  a.u.  compared  to  the 
velocities of free electrons typically of several atomic units. The number of electrons which 
escape from the confining sphere during a small time interval ∆t is calculated by elementary 
considerations.

occurred before  is  equal  to  the  expectation  value  of  the  number  of  escaping  electrons. Note 
that Ne is also a differential quantity since it corresponds to a small time interval ∆t, so that it 
is expected to be much smaller than 1. The probability Pl’ that branching out does not occur

The  final  step  m  has  to  be  treated  separately.  At  the  final  step,  the  stochastic  time 
development  stops  any  way,  because  the  charge  carrier  of  the  projectile  reaches  critical 
distance  so  that  all  transitions  are  closed.  Therefore,  all  the  states  are  fixed  at  the  final  step 
even if no electron escapes from the quasi molecule. The probability for this to happen is Pm= 
Pm’. 

'.

After  a  time  step  is  selected,  when  branching  out  occurs,  the  question  still  remains 
which state is fixed. In order to calculate the corresponding probabilities, besides population 
probabilities  (B3),  it  has  to be  taken  into  account  how  many  PLFEs  are  associated  with  the 
states.  This  is  given by  the  ionization  degree n.  The probability  of branching  out  is  linearly 
scales with it, therefore, for a given state, the fixing probability is

At final time step, the formula (B3) is applied for the fixing probability of given state since it 
is no more connected with electron emission. 

APPENDIX D: ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF THE EMITTED ELECTRONS 

According to the experiments, the angular distribution of the electrons is enhanced in 
the forward direction. In the framework of the model, this is due to the motion of the atomic 
centers on which the velocity distribution of the scattered electrons is centered. It is assumed 
that  on  each  scattering  center  there  is  a  free  electron population  with  equal probability.  The 
scatterings  result  in  zero  angular  momentum  electrons  (s-waves)  in  most  of  the  cases,  since 
the  velocity  of  the  scattering  centers  is  well  below  an  atomic  unit  and  the  effective  impact 
parameter  of  the  electrons  is  limited  to  a  few  atomic  units.  This  gives  a  net  angular 
momentum for electrons close to zero with respect to the scattering center. The wavefunctions 
of these states far from the scattering center inside the box behave as that of a free particle. In 
case of electron-electron collision, considering the equal masses, the position of the scattering 
center is taken to be the center of their mass. The energy distribution of the free electrons is 
determined by the  Boltzmann-factor. At a given  moment of the collision when n PLFEs  are 
present, their velocity distribution in the laboratory frame is given as follows

This  is  a  self-consistency  equation  for  the  velocity  distribution  of  n  electrons  Fn(v).  The 
velocity  distribution  of  the  single  electrons  f  is  defined  in  Eq  (C1),  vX  and  u1,2  are  the 
velocities  of  the  scattering  atomic  centers  and  electrons,  respectively.  The  sum  that  appears 
first  in  the  parenthesis  in  (D1)  describes  the  electrons  scattered  on  the  atomic  centers.  The 
single  electron  velocity  distributions  are  shifted by  the  velocities  vX  of  the  atomic  centers X 
and  summed.  The  following  term  describes  electron-electron  scattering  in  which  the  energy 
exchange with the rest of the system is involved. Before the scattering, the electrons have u1

and u2 velocities.  After the scattering event the one of the electrons will have velocity of  v 
with  a  distribution  of  f  centered  on  the  center  of  mass  of  the  electrons.  This  distribution  is 
integrated over all the possible velocity combination of colliding electrons weighted by their 
velocity distribution and multiplied by the number of the scattering electrons n-1. In order to 
get normalized n-electron distribution, the whole expression is multiplied by the total number 
of the free electrons n, and divided by the total number of the scattering centers. The number 
of  the  scattering  centers  is  the  number  of  the  atomic  centers  Na  plus  the  number  of  the 
scattering electrons n-1. 

 In order to solve Eq. (D1) for Fn(v), a Fourier transformation is used that transforms

The  second  term  in  the  sum  represents  a  contribution  from  multiple  ionization  processes 
where more PLFEs are involved above the electron, which escapes within a selected time step 
causing the branching out. The corresponding states of excess PLFEs are expected to be fixed 
by the branching out as well as the bound molecular states. The PLFEs are finally released as 
the  collision  partners  separate.  This  term  represents  a  small  contribution,  since  multiple 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
ionization  processes  are  not  dominant.  But  with  its  inclusion,  a  better  agreement  with  the 
experiments has been found. 

Absolute  cross  sections  for  the  distribution  of  emitted  electrons  are  obtained  by 
performing  the  calculation  for  different  impact parameters.  The  cylindrical  symmetry  of  the 
system is used for sparing computation time. The distribution of electrons associated with one 
impact parameter is rotated around the Z-axis with finite steps of 10° and averaged. This may 
cause  deviations  from  the  calculations  performed  ideally  with  random  initial  position  and 
orientation  for  the  projectile.  Since  the  used  set  of  the  impact  parameters  and  rotations  is 
dense  enough,  those  effects  are  expected  to  be  small.  The  double  differential  cross  sections 
(DDCS) with respect to energy and angle are calculated as

APPENDIX E: ENERGY LEVELS OF THE QUASI MOLECULE 

The energy levels of the triatomic system En,i   at ionization level n depend on all the 
three  internuclear  distances.  Strict  quantum  mechanical  calculations  for  the  3-dimensional 
potential  energy  surfaces  would  lead  to  high  computational  demand.  Instead  the  sum  of 
pairwise potentials of the binary subsystems (OH, ArO, ArH) is used as an approximation. At 
asymptotic  internuclear  separation  the  energy  of  the  quasi  molecule  is  the  sum  of  atomic 
energy levels, which are taken from the NIST database [40].  

The labeling of En,i is abbreviated.  To fully characterize the energy levels the index n 
is extended to set of indices (nh, no, na) denoting the ionization degree  of the H,  O and Ar 
atoms  respectively.  Whenever  sum  over  n  is  performed  in  the  statistical  quantities  in 
Appendix B , it denotes the sum over all three indices taking into account the n=nh+no+na-q 
relation. Likewise, the level index i should be extended to (ih, io, ia) denoting the excitation 
level of the H, O and Ar respectively. The energy level of the system is expressed as sum of 
atomic energy levels and pairwise potentials

where  J  denotes  the  total  angular  momentum  of  the  atomic  ions  at  the  dissociation  limit. 
Above ionization degree of 1 of both partners, both screening radii are small and the ions can 
be  considered  as  point  like  charges.  Therefore,  at  high  ionization  degrees,  the  energies 
obtained  from  screened  Coulombic  potentials  are  expected  to  be  close  to  the  real  ones.  For 
low  ionization  degrees,  where  molecular  features  are  pronounced  in  the  potential  energy 
curves, the use of ab initio potentials is essential for accurate results. 

 The  potential  energy  curves  taken  from  the  literature  are  fitted  by  approximating 
functions.  Table  3  gives  a  list  of  the  data  sources  and  fitting  functions  with  descriptions  of 
their usage. In a general case, different potential energy curves exist for a given dissociation 
limit of a diatomic system. These are labeled by the molecular terms. A molecular term can be 
degenerated.  In  this  case,  replicas  of  that  term  are  introduced  in  the  calculation  to  take  into 
account its multiplicity.  

The Boltzmann factors associated with a given atomic dissociation limit are averaged 
over all the combination of the diatomic molecular terms and weighted by the factor (E4) in 
the  calculated  probabilities.  Arbitrary  combinations  of  the  three  diatomic  molecular  terms 
may overestimate the number of possible states, but (E4) gives the correct weights. In the case 
when the model is applied to collisions between atomic ions and atoms, such overestimation 
does not occur.

In  Figure  13,  some  of  the  resulting  fit  functions  for  the  overall  three  center  system 
(Ar+(ground state)+OH) are shown compared with the data from the literature as function of 
the  OH  distance.  When  the  Ar+  center  is  asymptotically  far  in  panel  (a),  the  fit  functions 
reproduce  the  two  body  OH  potential  energy  curves  from  the  literature.  In  this  case,  the 
separate Ar+ ion only implies a shift in the total energy of the system. In panel (b), the case is 
presented  when  the  Ar+  center  is  at  a  molecular  distance  of  2.5  au.  from  the  H  center.  The 
potential curves are significantly changed. Some  of the ionic states (red curves in electronic 
version)  get closer to the levels corresponding to atomic dissociation limits (black curves in 
electronic version), and even cross them at large internuclear distances of 3 atomic units. As 
the energy of the levels of the ionic states are getting lower relatively to the other levels, the 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
population  of  the  ionic  states  increases  according  to  the  Boltzmann  factor.  This  effect 
enhances the positive and negative ion emission in a triatomic collision system. It is to be also 
noted that the diatomic potential energy curves splits due to the vicinity of the third center in 
Figure 13 (b).

Internuclear distance R (a.u.)

Figure 13 (Color online) Energy levels of the Ar+(2P) + OH system as function the OH distance. Dissociation 
limits for the OH radical and molecular terms are indicated in the figure. Lines are the resulting fit functions (see 
text). Black lines: atomic dissociation limit (O + H), red lines: ionic dissociation limits (O- + H+), and blue lines: 
(O+ + H-). Circles: data from the literature see Table 3. Asymptotic levels are fitted to the sum of atomic energy 
levels from NIST database [40]. The (Ar, H, O) centers form a right triangle. The Ar–H distance r is 100 au. and 
2.5 au. in panel (a) and (b) respectively. In panel (b), one can observe the splitting of the primary OH curves due 
to the nearness of Ar center.
