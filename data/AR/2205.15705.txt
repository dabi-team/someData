Abstract: We demonstrate generation of 7.6 fs near-UV pulses centered at 400 nm via 8-fold 
soliton-effect self-compression in an Ar-filled hollow-core kagomé-style photonic crystal fiber 
with ultrathin core walls. Analytical calculations of the effective compression length and soliton 
order  permit  adjustment  of  the  experimental  parameters,  and  numerical  modelling  of  the 
nonlinear pulse dynamics  in  the fiber  accurately predict the  spectro-temporal profiles of the 
self-compressed  pulses.  After  compensation  of  phase  distortion  introduced  by  the  optical 
elements along the beam path from the fiber to the diagnostics, 71% of the pulse energy was in 
the main temporal lobe, with peak powers in excess of 0.2 GW. The convenient set-up opens 
up  new  opportunities  for  time-resolved  studies  in  spectroscopy,  chemistry  and  materials 
science. 

1. 

Introduction 

Ultrashort  pulses  in  the  ultraviolet  (UV,  100  to  400  nm)  are  needed  for  time-resolved 
applications in fields such as ultrafast spectroscopy and femtochemistry [1,2], owing to large 
scattering  cross-sections  and strong  absorption  bands  that all  natural  molecules  have  in  this 
spectral region [3]. There are multiple approaches to generating ultrafast UV light, the most 
common being non-collinear optical parametric amplifiers [4], which are complex systems that 
require  careful  alignment  and  maintenance,  and  nonlinear  spectral  broadening  in  gas-filled 
wide-bore capillaries followed by post-compression [5]. Anti-resonant-reflecting hollow-core 
photonic crystal fibers (ARR-PCFs) [6,7], by permitting low loss guidance in a core some 10 
times smaller than wide-bore capillaries, permit operation with few microjoule pulses at much 
higher (MHz) repetition rates [8]. They also provide enhanced spatial mode quality, excellent 
broadband UV transparency, a high optical damage threshold, and pressure-tunable dispersion, 
which  taken  together  allow  confinement,  manipulation  and  safe  transport  of  UV  light  in  a 
precise manner over long distances. 

When filled with gas at different pressures,  the dispersion and nonlinearity of the  ARR-
PCFs can be easily adjusted, allowing access to different regimes of operation. In this context, 
generation  of  sub-μJ  near-UV  pulses  of  ~5.7  fs  duration  centered  at  400  nm  was  recently 
demonstrated using soliton-effect self-compression [9]. However, as in other previous studies 
in,  e.g.,  the  near-infrared  [10],  such  short  durations  could  only  be  indirectly  inferred  by 
numerically subtracting the external dispersion introduced by several optical components such 
as the windows sealing the gas cells, located along the beam path from the fiber endface to the 
diagnostics.  It  is  worth  noticing  that  most  optical  materials  become  increasingly  more 
dispersive  at  shorter  wavelengths,  which  hampers  ultrafast  UV  applications  especially  for 
larger  bandwidth  pulses.  Although  removing  the  windows  and  working  with  ambient  air 
partially resolves this issue [11], the compressed pulses are limited in energy, do not reach sub-
10-fs  duration  and  undergo  significant  spectral  red-shift  as  a  result  of  intra-pulse  Raman 
scattering, principally by N2. 

Here we report efficient self-compression of ~64 fs-long, chirped near-UV pulses centered 
at 400 nm (~40 fs bandwidth-limited duration) to ~7.6 fs (compression factor ~8.4) in an ultra-
thin-walled,  kagomé-style  ARR-PCF  filled  with  argon.  By  judiciously  choosing  the  fiber 
parameters, namely its length, core size, core-wall thickness, and gas pressure, we could operate 
with a low soliton order N ~ 3, thereby ensuring a fair compromise between compression factor 
and pulse quality Q, which we define as the ratio, in percentage, between the energy contained 
within the main temporal lobe of the pulse to the total pulse energy.  In contrast to previous 
reports, post-compensation of the distorted spectral phase using dispersive mirrors enabled in-
situ  characterization  of  the  ~7.6  fs-long  near-UV  pulses  using  self-diffraction  frequency-
resolved optical gating (SD-FROG) [12]. This direct measurement revealed that the quality of 
the output pulses reached values as high as Q ~ 71%, which along with peak powers up to ~0.2 
GW  and  excellent  spatial  mode  quality,  make  this  source  very  appealing  for  ultrafast 
spectroscopy. 

2.  Physical system 

The  proposed  scheme  relies  on  soliton-effect  self-compression  [10,13],  followed  by  post-
compensation of the chirp introduced along the optical path from the fiber output to the point 
of  use.  Upon  propagation  in  ARR-PCF,  pulses  with  sufficiently  high  peak  power  broaden 
spectrally  due  to  self-phase  modulation,  generating  a  positive  frequency  chirp,  which  is 
compensated  by  the  negative  group  velocity  dispersion  (GVD)  of  the  hollow  core  [14].  If 
higher-order effects and Raman scattering are absent, the pulse would reach a temporal focus 
2/|𝛽2| being  the dispersion  length 
after  propagating  a  distance 𝐿𝐶 ≈ √𝐿𝐷𝐿𝑁𝐿/2 [15], 𝐿𝐷 = 𝑇0
and 𝐿𝑁𝐿 = 1/𝛾𝑃0 the nonlinear length. Here, 𝑇0 is the pump pulse duration, 𝑃0 its peak power, 
𝛽2 the GVD and 𝛾 the nonlinear coefficient of the fiber. Fig. 1(a) shows the compression length 
for bandwidth-limited pulses of 40 fs centered at 400 nm, as a function of fiber core diameter 
and filling gas pressure (properties which  𝛽2 and 𝛾 depend on). For a ~22 μm-core ARR-PCF 
such as that used in our experiments, reasonable compression lengths of the order of 1 m are 
obtained for gas pressures of ~250 mbar (indicated by the pink dots). Furthermore, since the 
self-compression  quality is inversely proportional to the soliton order 𝑁 = √𝐿𝐷/𝐿𝑁𝐿, low  N 
values are required to achieve high enough Q, which again requires operation at low pressure 
(see inset of Fig. 1(a)). For our experimental parameters N ~ 3, permitting high-Q, 8-fold self-
compression of the initial near-UV pulses, as we will see below. 

Fig. 1(b) plots the wavelength dependence of the GVD for an ARR-PCF filled with Ar at 
250  mbar  (solid-blue  line)  and  evacuated  (solid-green  line).  The  analytical  calculation  was 
based  on  approximating  the propagation  constant  of  the  fundamental  LP01-like  mode  of  the 
kagomé ARR-PCF using the expression derived for a wide-bore capillary [16]: 

𝛽01(𝜔, 𝑝, 𝑇) = 𝑘√𝑛𝑔

2(𝜔, 𝑝, 𝑇) − (

2

, 

𝑢01
𝑘𝑎

)

(1) 

where 𝑘 = 𝜔/𝑐 is  the  vacuum  wavenumber, 𝑛𝑔 is  the  refractive  index  of  the  filling  gas  (at 
frequency  𝜔 ,  pressure  𝑝  and  temperature  𝑇 ), 𝑎  is  the  fiber  core  radius,  and 𝑢01  ≈  2.405. 
Importantly,  achieving  anomalous  dispersion  in  the  UV  (an  essential  ingredient  for  soliton-
effect self-compression) requires the fiber core to be small and the gas pressure low. Moreover, 
the core wall must be extremely thin (below 100 nm) so as to push the first-order anti-crossing 
between the fundamental core mode and resonances in the thin glass walls into the deep UV, 
thereby ensuring broadband operation and shallow dispersion above 200 nm. There is currently 
a  growing  interest  in  another  type  of  ARR-PCF  with  a  simplified  cladding  composed  of  a 
single-ring of hollow tubes [17,18]. While these structures offer remarkably low attenuation 
[19,20] and polarization-maintaining properties [21] in the near-infrared and visible domains, 
the UV region remains a challenge [22] where kagomé-style fibers are still competitive.

the light-red and white shading. Inset: Scanning electron micrograph of the fiber core structure. 

3.  Experimental set-up 

The experimental set-up is sketched in Fig. 2(a). Energy-tunable pulses at 400 nm, obtained 
from a frequency-doubled Ti:sapphire amplified system, were spatially filtered and launched 
with ~70% efficiency into a 1.14 m-long kagomé-style ARR-PCF with ~22 μm-core diameter 
and ~85 nm average core-wall thickness (see inset in Fig. 1(b)). The fiber was enclosed between 
two gas cells hermetically sealed with MgF2 windows, allowing selective gas pressurization. 
Eight bounces off a pair of negatively-chirped mirrors provided a total group delay dispersion 
(GDD) of ~ −400 fs2, and a pair of thin fused silica wedges were used to finely balance the 
positive GDD introduced by the output MgF2 window and the air-path to the SD-FROG set-up.

dashed  line  encloses  the  home-built,  all-reflective  SD-FROG  system.  Inset:  Self-diffracted 
orders on a view card placed at the position of the physical block. (b)  Temporal profile of the 
pump pulses characterized using SD-FROG. Inset: Transverse beam profile of the pump pulses. 

In  the  home-built,  dispersion-free  SD-FROG  system  (see  Fig.  2(a)),  a  D-shaped  mirror 
spatially divided the pulse into two identical replicas, the relative delay being controlled by a 
motorized stage. Upon interaction in a third-order nonlinear medium—in our case a thin fused-
silica plate—the two pulses generated a thin transient grating capable of diffracting the same 
pulses in the Raman-Nath regime, resulting in the pattern depicted in the inset. The SD-FROG 
spectrogram was then recorded by spectrally resolving one of the first diffracted orders for a 

 
 
 
series  of  incremental  delays.  It  is  well-known  that  the  limited  sensitivity  of  the  SD-FROG 
geometry  requires  sufficiently  high  input  energy  to  generate  a  detectable  signal  in  the  first 
diffracted order. To meet this requirement, we positively chirped the ~40 fs bandwidth-limited 
pump pulses to ~64 fs duration in order to permit damage-free launching of microjoule levels 
of energy into the fiber, which  provided strong enough output signal  for  complete temporal 
characterization using SD-FROG. The complete spatio-temporal profile of the pump pulses is 
shown in Fig. 2(b). 

4.  Results and discussion 

When 3 μJ pulses were launched into the ARR-PCF, filled with Ar at 250 mbar, 2.4 μJ was 
measured at the fiber output. The spectrogram recorded by SD-FROG after self-compression 
of the input pulses is shown in Fig. 3(a). It is a very simple trace featuring a tilted central stripe 
that contains two main peaks and several satellite lobes. The slight negative slope of the SD-
FROG spectrogram indicates that a small amount of negative GDD ~ −5 fs2 from the chirped 
mirrors was not totally compensated by the thin wedges. An algorithm based on the extended 
ptychographic  iterative  engine  [23]  was  then  used  to  retrieve  the  pulses.  The  retrieved 
spectrogram (Fig. 3(b)) is in good agreement with the measured one, containing the same main 
features. Thus, the ptychographic algorithm yielded a pulse duration of ~7.6 fs (Fig. 3(c)) with 
a quality factor Q ~ 71% and excellent transverse beam quality. The main peak is surrounded 
by pre- and post-pulses, a clear signature of higher-order-soliton-effect self-compression [13]. 
Finally, the excellent agreement between the retrieved spectrum and an independent reference 
(Fig. 3(d)) further confirmed the reliability of the pulse retrieval procedure.

self-compressed  pulses.  (d)  Retrieved  normalized  spectral  intensity  (solid-blue  line),  spectral 
phase (dashed-orange line), and measured reference spectrum (shaded gray). 

To  gain  further  insight  into  the  near-UV  self-compression  process,  we  simulated  the 
propagation  dynamics  of  the  measured  pump  pulses  (Fig.  2(b))  along  the  fiber  using  the 
generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation [11,14]. The simulated fiber characteristics were 
the same as in the experiment, the values of gas dispersion and nonlinearity being taken from 
[24] and [25].  The results of the simulations are displayed in Fig. 4. The  dynamic interplay 
between nonlinear self-phase modulation and the negative fiber GVD causes the pump pulses 

 
 
to  spectrally  broaden  (Fig.  4(a))  and  temporally  self-compress  (Fig.  4(b)).  Slight  deviations 
from an initial quasi-Gaussian spectral shape (Fig. 5(a)), along with the presence of  a small 
amount  of  third-order  dispersion  leads  to  an  asymmetric,  double-hump  output  spectrum,  in 
good  qualitative  agreement  with  the  experiments  (Fig.  5(a)).  Quantitatively,  however,  the 
bandwidth of the simulated spectrum is broader, extending up to 450 nm and supporting pulses 
with ~6.6 fs (solid-red line in Fig. 5(b)), slightly shorter than those measured by SD-FROG 
(shaded cyan in Fig. 5(b) for comparison). 

Fig. 4.  Simulated  spectral  (a) and  temporal  (b)  evolution  of  the  real  pump pulse propagating 
along  the  ARR-PCF  employed  in  the  experiment.  To  achieve  the  best  agreement  with  the 
experimental  results,  the  simulated input  pulse  energy  was decreased  by 40%  (there  is  some 
uncertainty in the values of the nonlinear coefficients in the UV). The plots are normalized to 
the overall maximum intensity and the time delay is relative to a reference frame co-moving at 
the pump group velocity. 

We attribute this discrepancy between simulated and measured pulse durations to the likely 
loss of some spectral components in the experiment along the pathway from the fiber output to 
the diagnostics. To support this assertion, we simulated this effect by numerically applying a 
super-Gaussian window to filter out the red tail of the simulated output spectrum (solid-red line 
in Fig. 5(a)) so that it would resemble more closely the experimental reference (shaded gray 
region in Fig. 5(a)). The spectrum obtained as a result of this short-pass filtering (dashed-purple 
line in Fig. 5(a)) indeed supports high-quality pulses of ~7.8 fs (dashed-purple line in Fig. 5(b)), 
in close agreement with the retrieval.

spectral profiles of the out-coupled pulses, together with the initial pump spectrum (solid-blue 
line). The result of applying a super-Gaussian filter of 67 nm full-width at half-maximum and 
centered  at  387  nm  to  the  simulated  spectrum  is  also  displayed  in  dashed-purple  line.  (b) 
Simulated  (solid-red  line)  and  retrieved  (shaded  cyan)  temporal  profiles  of  the  out-coupled 
pulses. For comparison, the temporal profile corresponding to the filtered spectrum shown in (a) 
is also included in dashed-purple line. 

 
 
 
 
5.  Conclusions and outlook 

Near-UV, μJ-level pulses of tens of femtoseconds at 400 nm can be efficiently self-compressed 
down to few femtoseconds using a suitably designed meter-scale kagomé-style ARR-PCF filled 
with Ar at low pressure. By adding dispersion compensation elements after the fiber output, 8-
fold compression of the input pulses to ~7.6 fs duration can be obtained, with very high spatio-
temporal  quality  and  peak  powers  as  high  as  ~0.2  GW.  Numerical  modelling  accurately 
describes  the  nonlinear  soliton  dynamics,  confirming  the  spectro-temporal  properties  of  the 
experimental  self-compressed  pulses.  The  system  could  be  used  "as  is"  for  time-resolved 
applications in fields such as spectroscopy or materials science.
