Abstract

Solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections are among the most prominent manifestations of the magnetic activity of the Sun. The strongest events
of them tend to occur in active regions (ARs) that are large, complex, and dynamically evolving. However, it is not clear what the key observational
features of such ARs are, and how these features are produced. This article answers these fundamental questions based on morphological and
magnetic characteristics of ﬂare-productive ARs and their evolutionary processes, i.e., large-scale ﬂux emergence and subsequent AR formation,
which have been revealed in observational and theoretical studies. We also present the latest modeling of ﬂare-productive ARs achieved using the
most realistic ﬂux emergence simulations in a very deep computational domain. Finally, this review discusses the future perspective pertaining to
relationships of ﬂaring solar ARs with the global-scale dynamo and stellar superﬂares.

1. Introduction

The Sun ceaselessly exhibits activity events of various scales
over the whole spectrum of electromagnetic waves. Solar ﬂares
and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are among the most promi-
nent energy-releasing phenomena in the current solar system
(Fletcher et al., 2011; Shibata & Magara, 2011). Most power-
ful events often emanate from active regions (ARs) that harbor
substantial magnetic non-potentiality.

ARs are created owing to the emergence of dynamo-
generated toroidal magnetic ﬂux from the subsurface layer (ﬂux
emergence; Parker 1955). In the convection zone, where the
gas pressure surpasses the magnetic pressure (i.e., plasma-β is
greater than unity), magnetic ﬂux is buﬀeted by convective tur-
bulence and accumulates twist during its ascent. However, as
the ﬂux reaches the photosphere and moves further into the at-
mosphere, where the plasma density drastically decreases and
the magnetic ﬁeld is dominant (β < 1), the ﬂux begins to build
up ARs. Owing to the drastic reduction of the external gas
pressure, the ﬂux expands into the atmosphere, and the accu-

mulated twist can be released. If an AR has a suﬃcient amount
of magnetic ﬂux, sunspots are gradually produced, and ﬂares
and CMEs may occasionally occur if the free magnetic energy
(∆Emag) stored in the corona is suddenly released, where

Fig. 1 presents the observation of an M-class ﬂare (occurred
in February 2011) in NOAA AR 11158. The chromospheric
image (top panel) displays two bright patches, known as ﬂare
ribbons, that extend at both sides of the polarity inversion line
(PIL), where the magnetic polarity (Bz, or the Stokes-I/V signal
in the middle panel) alters its sign.

In the ﬂare theories such as the CSHKP model (after
Carmichael, 1964; Sturrock, 1966; Hirayama, 1974; Kopp &
Pneuman, 1976) and its variations, the ﬂare ribbons brighten in
response to the injection of energy that precipitates along the
loops, sourcing from the site of magnetic reconnection in the
corona. The heated chromospheric plasma evaporates and ﬁlls
the coronal loops, which leads to the stark enhancement of the
soft X-ray ﬂux, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. The

mary targets in solar physics to be explored in the next decade
(see, e.g., Schrijver et al., 2015).

In the rest of this article, we focus on the ﬂux emergence and
formation of ARs that are prone to major solar ﬂares, and thus,
for the understanding of ﬂares and CMEs, readers are advised
to refer to other excellent reviews (e.g., Priest & Forbes, 2002;
Chen, 2011; Fletcher et al., 2011; Shibata & Magara, 2011; Jan-
vier et al., 2015; Benz, 2017, and references therein).

Section 2 provides an overview of ﬂare-productive ARs by
reviewing the observational features of the ARs. Section 3
presents theoretical studies to numerically reproduce the for-
mation processes of ﬂaring ARs. Section 4 introduces the latest
modeling attempts of ﬂaring ARs with the most realistic setup.
Section 5 summarizes the paper and discusses some remaining
problems.

2. Observational aspects

This section deals with the observational aspects of ﬂare-
productive ARs. Since the discovery of solar ﬂares (Carrington,
1859; Hodgson, 1859), signiﬁcant eﬀort has been made to scru-
tinize the mechanism and origin of eruptions. Considering that
strong ﬂares mostly occur in ARs, we can directly examine the
relationship between the ﬂares and morphological and magnetic
characteristics of their hosting sunspots, which we elaborate in
the following subsections.

2.1. δ-sunspots and ﬂare activity

Observers have noticed that the structure of sunspots is one
of the key factors that determine the ﬂare activity. For instance,
in the following Mt. Wilson sunspot classiﬁcation, δ-spots are
known to be very ﬂare-active (K¨unzel, 1960):

• α, a unipolar spot group

• β, a single bipolar spot group of both positive and negative

polarities

• γ, a complex spot group in which spots of both polarities
are distributed so irregularly as to prevent classiﬁcation as
a β group

• δ, a spot group in which umbrae of opposite polarities are
separated by less than 2◦ and situated within the common
penumbra

Sammis et al. (2000) showed that the ﬂare magnitude increases
with the size and complexity of the spot groups. According to
these authors, all ≥X4-class ﬂares occur in spot groups of areas
greater than 1000 MSH and classiﬁed as the most complex βγδ.
Major spaceweather events in history were mostly caused
by δ-spots. For instance, the great geomagnetic storm in March
1989, which caused a severe power outage in Quebec, Canada,
and damaged devices at power plants in New Jersey, USA, is
related to NOAA AR 5395 and its series of strong ﬂares (e.g.,
Allen et al., 1989). The images and magnetograms of this AR,
as shown in Wang et al. (1991), reveal the existence of large
complex-shaped δ-spots.

Fig. 1. M6.6-class ﬂare in NOAA AR 11158 as observed by Hinode/SOT (Ko-
sugi et al., 2007; Tsuneta et al., 2008) with the GOES soft X-ray light curve.
The detailed analysis suggests that the hook-shaped magnetic ﬁeld on the PIL
triggered the event (Kusano et al., 2012; Bamba et al., 2013). Figure reproduced

loops gradually cool down with time through radiation and ther-
mal conduction, and eventually, the X-ray light curve returns to
the background level.

As a result of reconnection, a helical ﬂux rope is ejected
upward, probably with the support of plasma instabilities, and,
if successful, it develops into a CME that travels through the
interplanetary space. The ﬂare event in Fig. 1 was reportedly
accompanied by the CME eruption (e.g., Liu et al., 2012; Inoue
et al., 2018).

The overall description above, i.e., from the dynamo, ﬂux
emergence, AR formation, to the subsequent occurrence of
ﬂares and CMEs, is accepted in the research community. How-
ever, in this article, we address the following two key questions:

• What are the important observational features of the ﬂare-

productive ARs?

• If there exist any, how are these features created?

As the genesis of ﬂaring ARs is related to the prediction and
forecasting of ﬂare eruptions, it is recognized as one of the pri-

Zirin & Liggett (1987) categorized the formation of δ-spots

into three types:

• Type 1: spots emerging all at once, intertwined

• Type 2: satellite spots near larger older spots

• Type 3: collision of two bipoles

The representative spot group of Type 1 is NOAA 5395 (March
1989), but other events, such as NOAA 5629 (August 1989),
5747 (October 1989), and 6659 (June 1991), have been exten-
sively analyzed (Tang & Wang, 1993; Schmieder et al., 1994).
A clear example of Type 2 is NOAA 10930 (December 2006).
An X3.4-class ﬂare occurred between sunspots of positive and
negative polarities, but the positive spot was a part of a newly-
emerging bipole, whose counterpart was quickly disappearing
(Kubo et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008): Observations of NOAA
10930 are summarized in Section 8 of Hinode Review Team
et al. (2019). NOAA 11158 (Fig. 1: February 2011) is the
typical Type 3 δ-spot. In this event, two bipoles emerged and
underwent ﬂy-by motion (near head-on collision). A series of
strong ﬂares occurred between the positive and negative spots,
originated from diﬀerent emerging bipoles, at the center (Chint-
zoglou & Zhang, 2013; Toriumi et al., 2014).

Fig. 2 displays four categories of ﬂaring ARs (Toriumi et al.,
2017). Surveying 51 ≥M5-class events that occurred within
45◦ from the disk center over six years, these authors classi-
ﬁed ARs based on their evolutionary patterns: (1) spot-spot, a

complex, compact δ-spots, in which an elongated PIL extends
across the entire AR (probably equivalent to Type 1 δ-spot); (2)
spot-satellite, where a new emerging ﬂux collides with an ex-
isting spot (Type 2); and (3) quadrupolar, the collision of two
bipoles (Type 3). It was found that 83% of the analyzed ARs
displayed δ-structures. However, two ﬂares (X1.2 and M5.1)
occurred at the boundaries among separated independent ARs
(inter-AR cases), indicating that X-class events do not require
δ-spots.

Therefore, it is possible to categorize the formation of ﬂar-
ing ARs based on the apparent motions of individual polarities.
However, we cannot investigate the subsurface ﬂux emergence
from direct optical observations. This is why the series of ﬂux
emergence simulations have been conducted.

2.2. Observational characteristics

In ﬂaring ARs, PILs show a strong horizontal ﬁeld (>4000
G), strong Bz gradient (∼100 G Mm−1), and strong magnetic
shear (80◦–90◦ from the direction of the potential ﬁeld) (Sev-
ernyj, 1958; Hagyard et al., 1984; Wang et al., 1996; Schri-
jver, 2007). Recently, Okamoto & Sakurai (2018), Wang et al.
(2018), and Castellanos Dur´an et al. (2020) detected super-
strong magnetic ﬁelds of &6000 G in the transverse ﬁelds of
δ-spots light bridges (i.e., PILs). These values are probably the
strongest ever measured on the Sun, including the sunspot um-
brae. These strong-ﬁeld, strong-gradient, highly-sheared PILs
can be direct manifestation of the non-potentiality of magnetic

4

ﬁelds. Therefore, observational parameters that characterize
ﬂaring PILs have been extensively used to predict ﬂares and
CMEs (e.g., Falconer et al., 2002; Leka & Barnes, 2003; Schri-
jver, 2007; Kusano et al., 2020).

Such ﬂaring PILs are often produced in the course of spot ro-
tations and counter-streaming ﬂows at PILs (Harvey & Harvey,
1976). For instance, the ﬂares in NOAA 10930 occurred along
the PIL between the two spots, and Min & Chae (2009) reported
a fast spot rotation with an angular speed of ∼ 8◦ hr−1 before
the X-class event, which sheared the magnetic ﬁelds around the
PIL and supplied free energy. Chintzoglou et al. (2019) pointed
out that ﬂaring PILs are created by the relative movement of the
spots, especially when the shearing and ﬂux cancellation de-
velop owing to the spot collision (collisional shearing). These
PILs sometimes exhibit the “magnetic channel,” an alternating
pattern of elongated positive and negative polarities (Zirin &
Wang, 1993a,b).

The complexity of ARs are often quantiﬁed by the magnetic
helicity, a measure of magnetic topology such as twists, kinks,
and internal linkage (Elsasser, 1956). The helicity of the mag-
netic ﬁeld B fully contained in volume V is deﬁned as

H =

ZV

A · B dV,

(2)

where A is the vector potential of B, i.e., B = ∇ × A. In prac-
tical situations in solar physics, the magnetic ﬁeld lines cross
the boundary (e.g., the photosphere); therefore, it is more con-
venient to use the relative helicity,

HR =

ZV

( A + A0) · (B − B0) dV,

(3)

where A0 and B0 are the reference values of A and B, respec-
tively (Berger & Field, 1984; Finn & Antonsen Jr, 1985). HR
has the advantage of being gauge invariant, and, in many cases,
the potential ﬁeld Bpot (= ∇ × Apot) is chosen as the refer-
ence ﬁeld. Numerous observations have claimed the relation-
ship between helicity injection and ﬂare occurrence (see, e.g.,
D´emoulin & Pariat, 2009; Valori et al., 2016, and references
therein).

The “magnetic tongues,” the two extended polarities on
magnetograms at both sides of the PILs, especially when they
have a yin-yang pattern, are assumed to be the vertical projec-
tion of the poloidal component of the twisted emerging mag-
netic ﬂux (L´opez Fuentes et al., 2000). Therefore, the arrange-
ment of the tongues and PILs represent the sign of helicity in
ARs, and observations reveal that ﬂaring ARs show such ying-
yang tongues (e.g., Mandrini et al., 2014; Poisson et al., 2015).
In the atmosphere above the PIL, magnetic ﬂux ropes (bun-
dles of twisted ﬁeld lines) are sometimes observed as “sig-
moids” in soft X-rays (Rust & Kumar, 1996; Canﬁeld et al.,
1999) and “ﬁlaments” in Hα images (Pevtsov, 2002). The ob-
servations indicate that the ﬁlament formation is in favor of
the model proposed by van Ballegooijen & Martens (1989), in
which converging and shearing ﬂows around the PIL cause can-
cellation and twisting of the ﬁeld lines to eventually produce a
ﬂux rope (ﬁlaments/prominences) above the PIL.

Other characteristics, such as non-neutralized electric cur-
rents, structural complexity of photospheric magnetograms,
non-thermal broadening of coronal emission lines, and helio-
seismic (subsurface) signatures, exist. Moreover, the triggering
of ﬂare eruptions are often associated with the rapid develop-
ment of photospheric magnetic ﬁelds. For more comprehensive
discussion, readers may refer to Section 3 of Toriumi & Wang
(2019).

3. Theoretical aspects

As ARs are created through ﬂux emergence from below the
solar surface, it is essential to trace the evolution of magnetic
ﬂux from the deeper convection zone into the atmosphere. To
realize this, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of
ﬂux emergence have been performed (Archontis, 2008; Fan,
2009; Cheung & Isobe, 2014; Schmieder et al., 2014). In typ-
ical ﬂux emergence simulations, in the stratiﬁed atmospheric
layers representing the solar convection zone, photosphere,
chromosphere, and corona, a ﬂux tube is initially embedded
into the convection zone. The ﬂux tube starts rising by, for
instance, perturbing velocity ﬁelds inside the tube or partially
reducing the density from the tube to trigger the buoyant emer-
gence (Parker instability: Parker 1979). As it ascents to the
atmosphere, the ﬂux tube builds up bipolar spots in the photo-
sphere and magnetic loops in the corona.

To explain the generation of ﬂare-productive ARs, several
scenarios have been suggested and tested by performing such
ﬂux emergence simulations. In this section, we review the past
attempts to theoretically model the observed characteristics of
ﬂaring ARs.

3.1. Idealized models

Many of the ﬂux emergence simulations conducted so far
fall into the category of idealized models, where the subsurface
layer is given as an adiabatically stratiﬁed, plane parallel atmo-
sphere; i.e., the interior is not convectively unstable. This treat-
ment sets aside the complex eﬀect of turbulent convection and
allows modelers to focus on the essential physical processes.

One of the representative scenarios of δ-spot formation is
the “kinked tube” model, in which a strongly twisted tube rises
owing to the kink instability (Tanaka, 1991). Using the anelas-
tic MHD code, Fan et al. (1999) calculated the emergence of
a kink-unstable ﬂux tube in the interior and discovered that
the horizontal slice of the emerging ﬂux tube displays a com-
pact bipolar pair with sheared PIL. Although this morphology
is reminiscent of δ-spots, these simulations were limited to the
convection zone due to the anelastic approximation. Takasao
et al. (2015) coped with this problem by solving fully compress-
ible MHD equations and extending the computational box to the
corona. Interestingly, their modeled spots present, in spite of
the simple bipolar conﬁguration, a quadrupolar structure com-
prising main bipolar spots with an elongated pair in between
(left column of Fig. 3). Owing to the release of the helicity, the
main spots show strong rotational motions, which is one of the

6

key characteristics of the ﬂaring ARs. The complex morphol-
ogy in the magnetogram suggests that the kinked tube model
may explain Type 1 δ-spots (see also Knizhnik et al., 2018).

The second group is the “interacting tube” model, in which
multiple ﬂux bundles interfere with each other to build a single,
perhaps complex, AR (e.g., Murray & Hood, 2007). As shown
in Fig. 3, second column from the left, a parasitic ﬂux tube is
placed right above the main tube along the orthogonal direction.
Lifted by the main tube, the parasitic tube produces satellite
spots in the proximity to the main spot (indicated by green ar-
rows). Therefore, this scenario may be one of the mechanisms
of Type 2 δ-spots, in which newly emerging ﬂux appears within
the penumbra of the existing spot (see also Jouve et al., 2018).
In the “multi-buoyant segment” scenario, a single ﬂux tube
becomes buoyant at two segments along the tube, probably
caused by the convective pinning at the middle, and produces a
pair of emerging bipoles on the surface, i.e., a quadrupolar AR
(Toriumi et al., 2014). In this case, the two bipoles cause head-
on collision in between, and as a result, strongly packed positive
and negative polarities are created with a highly sheared PIL in
the center of the quadrupolar AR (Fig. 3, third column). The
overall evolution resembles Type 3 δ-spots (Fang & Fan, 2015;
Syntelis et al., 2019).

These models succeeded in reproducing δ-conﬁgurations,
sheared PILs, ﬂux ropes, and others, all of which are the essen-
tial ingredients of the ﬂaring ARs. Toriumi & Takasao (2017)
performed a systematic survey of the aforementioned models
using similar numerical conditions with as little diﬀerence as
possible (Fig. 3). Key ﬁndings are summarized below.

• Highly sheared PILs are formed owing to the combined
eﬀects of advection, stretching, and compression of mag-
netic ﬁelds, exerted by the spot motion.

• Flux ropes are created above the PIL. However, access to
the outer atmosphere (interplanetary space) depends on the
magnetic structure of the entire AR, and this may deter-
mine the CME productivity.

• Free energy is accumulated in the corona in the form of
current sheets. Magnetic parameters that predict solar
ﬂares with high accuracy (e.g., Bobra & Couvidat, 2015)
reﬂect the free magnetic energy stored in the corona well.

3.2. Realistic models

Contrary to idealized models, ﬂux emergence models that
incorporate the eﬀect of thermal convection enable us to under-
stand complex realistic aspects of the evolution, in particular,
the coupling of magnetic ﬁeld and turbulence. For instance,
Cheung et al. (2010) modeled the emergence of a twisted ﬂux
tube from the convective convection zone and eventual forma-
tion of proto-sunspots. By kinematically inserting the ﬂux tube
from the bottom boundary, placed at 7.5 Mm below the photo-
sphere, as a sequentially updated bottom boundary, the authors
succeeded in reproducing spots with umbral dots, light bridges,
and penumbral ﬁlaments, which are the manifestation of mag-
netoconvection (see also Rempel & Cheung, 2014).

Using the updated version of the same code, which is now
extended to the solar corona, Cheung et al. (2019) mimicked
the emergence of small satellite spots within the penumbra of
the existing spot to reproduce X-class ﬂares in NOAA 12017
(April 2014). Their numerical results explain the properties of
solar ﬂares, such as temporal evolution of X-ray light curve,
chromospheric evaporation, and ﬂare ribbon expansion.

The interplay between the global-scale convection and mag-
netic ﬂux has been strenuously investigated by using the 3D
spherical shell models. For example, Nelson et al. (2013) sim-
ulated the self-consistent generation of Ω-loops from a bundle
of toroidal ﬂux, whereas Jouve et al. (2013) modeled the emer-
gence of a magnetic ﬂux tube that is placed at the depth of the
convection zone. Jouve et al. (2018) also investigated the in-
teraction of multiple emerging ﬂux tubes and pointed out the
possibility that such interactions introduce complexity to ARs.
Although these computations are limited to the convection zone
due to the anelastic approximation and, thus, cannot simulate
the emergence into the photosphere, they revealed the impor-
tance of the turbulent background convection and the mutual
interaction of ﬂux tubes.

4. New twist

Flux emergence simulations have succeeded in explaining
various aspects of the mechanisms behind the formation of
ﬂare-producing ARs. However, most simulations are idealized:
many models lack the realistic convection zone, or the emer-
gence is triggered by artiﬁcially imposed buoyancy. Even in
convective ﬂux emergence simulations, the bottom boundary
is not deep enough, at most −30 Mm (Chen et al., 2017), and
ﬂux tubes are kinematically injected from the bottom boundary.
However, in reality, ARs are formed as the outcome of interac-
tion between magnetic ﬂux and background turbulent convec-
tion. To elucidate the eﬀect and importance of deep large cells
on the ﬂux emergence, there has been a demand for detailed
calculations.

To overcome these issues, Toriumi & Hotta (2019) lever-
aged the newly developed radiative MHD code R2D2 (Hotta
et al., 2019; Hotta & Iijima, 2020). In brief, this code repro-
duces the realistic solar convection in a very deep domain by
employing the reduced sound-speed technique (Rempel, 2005;
Hotta et al., 2012) and allows for the exploration of magneto-
convective evolution in the whole solar convection zone. First,
the 3D computation box that spanned from −139.2 Mm to +700
km in height with a horizontal width of 98.3 Mm × 98.3 Mm
was prepared, and the box was numerically resolved by a
1024 × 1024 × 256 grid (see Fig. 4). Considering that the pre-
vious convective emergence models reached down to approxi-
mately −30 Mm and that the solar convection zone is a strongly
stratiﬁed medium, the simulation with the bottom boundary at
−140 Mm is a signiﬁcant advancement: The gas pressure at
−140 Mm is eight orders of magnitude greater than that in the
photosphere. The periodic boundary condition was applied to
both horizontal directions.

After the development of thermal convection in the box, a
twisted force-free ﬂux tube was placed at the depth of 16.7 Mm,

Shin Toriumi / Advances in Space Research xx (2021) xxx-xxx

and 70 Mm) drag down the ﬂux tube to make a W-shaped con-
ﬁguration. On the surface, the two emerging bipoles approach
each other as they expand, and eventually, two δ-spots, N1-
P2 and N2-P1, are formed. The visibility in the intensity map
shows that in each spot, the umbrae of opposite polarities reside
in a common penumbra, satisfying the deﬁnition of the δ-spot
(Section 2.1).

The PIL between the two spots within each δ-spot shows a
narrow lane of elongated granular cells (light bridge), and the
polarity pattern resembles the magnetic channel structure. The
previous simulations revealed that the light bridges in regular
spots comprise granules, which, especially in the case of nar-
row light bridges, resemble the penumbra with an elongated
magnetic ﬁeld (Cheung et al., 2010; Toriumi et al., 2015a,b).
The δ-spot light bridge reproduced here shares a similar mag-
netoconvective structure.

In the photosphere, all four spots show counter-clockwise
rotations owing to the releasing of the twist of the tube, which
was imposed as the initial condition. As a result, a sheared (or
counter-streaming) ﬂow is excited around the PIL between the
two neighboring spots of each δ-spot, and this velocity ﬁeld ar-
ranges the transverse component of the magnetic ﬁeld to make
the PIL highly sheared. The ﬁeld strength pertaining to the PIL
area far exceeds the equipartition value, which is of the order of
1 kG. Hotta & Toriumi (2020) performed high-resolution cal-
culations, where the grid spacing is up to four times ﬁner, and
discovered that a very strong horizontal ﬁeld of &6000 G is
formed at the edge of the δ-spot light bridge. The ﬁeld strength
matches the recent observations made by Okamoto & Sakurai
(2018) and others.

Fig. 6 shows the ﬁeld line structure above one of the δ-spots
in Fig. 5. Driven by the counter-streaming ﬂow in the photo-
sphere, the overlying arcade ﬁeld is sheared and forms a ﬂux
rope structure. The 6-kG horizontal ﬁeld (Hotta & Toriumi,
2020) is created by the strong shear at the δ-spot PIL, which is
sustained owing to the downward magnetic force caused by the
overlying arcade.

The above simulations demonstrate that the ﬂux emergence
in the deep-enough computational box self-consistently repro-
duces δ-spots and other key features. The entire evolution of
δ-spots follows the multi-buoyant segment scenario, in which a
single ﬂux system in the interior rises at two locations to pro-
duce colliding bipoles. It should be emphasized that the δ-spot
formation is a result of coupling between the magnetic ﬂux and
turbulent background convection.

5. Summary and discussion

In this article, we discussed important observational features
of ﬂare-productive ARs, including δ-spots, sheared PILs, mag-
netic channels, rotating spots, and ﬂux ropes. These structures
are reproduced by numerical models that have been performed
over the past decades.
In particular, state-of-the-art realistic
ﬂux emergence simulations that contain large convective cells
in deeper layers are now able to reproduce all these features in
a self consistent manner, and we understand that the interac-

a0 = 2.404825, and Rtb = 7 Mm the tube’s radius. Unlike previ-
ous models, the ﬂux tube was neither endowed with an artiﬁcial
buoyancy nor forcibly injected into the domain. The tube was
simply advected by the turbulent background convection.

Note that using 16.7 Mm as the initial depth allows us to
investigate the emergence from the critical layer, where the
approximations assumed in the previous simulations become
invalid (around −20 Mm for the anelastic and thin ﬂux tube
approximations; Fan 2009). The artiﬁcial inﬂuences caused
by adding a ﬂux tube into the domain at one time step where
there was none at the previous step (e.g., Cheung et al., 2008),
such as a lack of the perfect mechanical balance, can be cir-
cumvented using the ﬂux injection method. However, these
inﬂuences would be minor because vigorous turbulence dras-
tically reforms the magnetic conﬁguration (see the following
paragraphs).

Fig. 5 shows the evolutions of intensity, surface magne-
togram, and magnetic ﬁeld in the vertical cross-section. First, a
large convection upﬂow elevates the ﬂux tube at the side edge of
the box at x = 0 and 98.3 Mm (because of the periodic boundary
condition), and a bipolar pair P1-N1 appears in the photosphere.
As time progresses, the secondary pair P2-N2 emerges in the
middle of the domain owing to another upﬂowing region and,
consequently, a quadrupolar AR is formed. The right column
demonstrates that two strong downdrafts (approximately x = 30

be noted that this ﬂux rope is created as a result of magnetic reconnection between the ﬁeld lines originating from the two independent but neighboring sunspots N2
and P1, rather than the direct emergence of the original ﬂux tube. Figure reproduced from Toriumi & Hotta (2019) by permission of the AAS.

Fig. 7. Selected key observational features (mainly photospheric) discussed in this article and their relationships as revealed by the series of observational and
theoretical studies. The morphological and magnetic complexities of ﬂare-productive ARs are derived ultimately from the close interplay between magnetic ﬂux
and turbulent convection, i.e., the magnetoconvective nature of dynamo mechanisms in the deep interior.

tion between magnetic ﬂux and turbulent convection introduces
such complexity in the ARs (see Fig. 7).

Although most sophisticated models reveal the critical as-
pects of the formation of ﬂare-productive ARs, there still re-
mains a scale gap between the localized ﬂux-emergence sim-
ulations and global-scale dynamo models. For instance, al-
most none of the initial ﬂux tubes in the ﬂaring AR models
introduced in Sections 3 and 4 is given as a dynamo-generated
toroidal ﬂux, and it is not obvious if these initial conditions are
truly natural. Therefore, the next step of the R2D2 calculation
would be to test the realistic ﬂux emergence from much deeper
layers. Ultimately, it is necessary to simultaneously solve the
dynamo action in the deep convection zone of a global scale
and the development of ARs on the surface to gain comprehen-
sive understanding of the entire history from the interior to the
surface.

From the observational aspect,

it has been pointed out
that the ﬂare reconnection is triggered by small-scale, per-
haps subarcsec-sized, photospheric ﬁelds around the PIL (Wang
et al., 2017, and references therein). Therefore, to understand
the origin and development of ﬂare triggers, unprecedented
high-resolution polarimetry as achieved by DKIST (Rimmele
et al., 2020) is demanded. Further, UV observations suggest
that the charging of ﬂare energy in the atmosphere may be quan-
tiﬁed by the non-thermal broadening of coronal emission lines

(Harra et al., 2009; Imada et al., 2014). Such spectroscopic
signatures of energy accumulation over the course of AR de-
velopment would be one of the optimal targets of the next-
generation space UV observatories Solar-C (EUVST) (Shimizu
et al., 2019) and MUSE (De Pontieu et al., 2020). Neverthe-
less, these eﬀorts would be facilitated more by the support of
advanced modeling capabilities.

Recent progress in observing stellar ﬂares indicates the oc-
currence of superﬂares on solar-type stars, which are 10–1000
times stronger than those on the Sun (e.g., Maehara et al., 2012),
and this leads to the discussion on the possibility of superﬂares
on the Sun (e.g., Aulanier et al., 2013; Shibata et al., 2013).
Then, how do such superﬂaring starspots occur? As described
in Section 2, on the Sun, we know that large, complex, rapidly-
evolving ARs tend to produce massive ﬂares. Therefore, it is
required to obtain the information of starspot evolution and its
relation with stellar ﬂares (Namekata et al., 2019). Recently,
Toriumi et al. (2020) focused on the Sun-as-a-star spectral ir-
radiance variations of transiting sunspots and revealed that the
multi-wavelength monitoring of the stars may help us under-
stand the structures and evolutions of starspots. In future, prob-
ably by combining with the numerical models, we may have a
more detailed approach on ﬁnding the cause of stellar ﬂares.
