ON A GENERALIZATION OF TWO RESULTS OF HAPPEL TO
COMMUTATIVE RINGS

TONY J. PUTHENPURAKAL

Abstract. In this paper we extend two results of Happel to commutative
rings. Let (A, m) be a commutative Noetherian local ring. Let Db
f (mod(A))
be the bounded derived category of complexes of ﬁnitely generated modules
over A with ﬁnite length cohomology. We show Db
f (mod(A)) has Auslander-
Reiten(AR)-triangles if and only if A is regular. Let K b
f (proj A) be the ho-
motopy category of ﬁnite complexes of ﬁnitely generated free A-modules with
ﬁnite length cohomology. We show that if A is complete and if A is Gorenstein
then K b
f (proj A) has
AR triangles and if A is Cohen-Macaulay or if dim A = 1 then A is Gorenstein.

f (proj A) has AR triangles. Conversely we show that if K b

1. introduction

Let Γ be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra over a ﬁeld k. Happel proved that its
bounded derived category Db(mod(Γ)) has Auslander-Reiten (AR) triangles if and
only if Γ has ﬁnite global dimension, see [5, 3.6], [7, 1.5]. He also proved that
K b(proj Γ) the homotopy category of bounded complexes of ﬁnitely generated pro-
jective Γ-modules has right AR triangles if and only if Γ is a Gorenstein algebra,
see [8, 3.4]. As exempliﬁed by Auslander that concepts in the study of repre-
sentation theory of Artin algebras have natural analogues in study of maximal
Cohen-Macaulay modules over Cohen-Macaulay local rings. In this paper we study
natural analogues of Happel’s results in the context of commutative Noetherian
rings.

Let (A, m) be a commutative Noetherian local ring of dimension d. Let

Cb(mod(A)) be the category of bounded complexes of ﬁnitely generated A-modules.
Let K b(mod(A)) be the corresponding homotopy category and let Db(mod(A) be
the bounded derived category of A. We write complexes cohomologically.

with di+1 ◦ di = 0 for all i.

Let Cb(proj A) (and C−,b(proj A)) be category of bounded complexes (respec-
tively bounded above with H ∗(X•) ﬁnitely generated for all X•) ) of ﬁnitely gen-
erated free A-module and let K b(proj A) (and K −,b(proj A)) be the corresponding
homotopy categories. Recall that in general Db(mod A) ∼= K −,b(proj A) and if A is
regular local then Db(mod A) ∼= K b(mod A). Let Db
f (mod(A)) be the bounded de-
rived category of complexes of ﬁnitely generated modules over A with ﬁnite length
cohomology. Then it can be shown that Db
f (mod(A)) is a Hom-ﬁnite Krull-Schmidt

triangulated category, see 4.1. Our generalization of Happel’s results [5, 3.6], [7,
1.5] is the following:

Theorem 1.1. Let (A, m) be a commutative Noetherian local ring. The following
conditions are equivalent:

(i) A is regular.
(ii) Db

f (mod(A)) has AR-triangles.

Our proof is not similar to Happel’s.
To state our next result we need the following notation. Let K b

f (proj A) be
the subcategory of K b(proj A) with ﬁnite length cohomology. By Happel’s result if
(A, m) is a zero-dimensional commutative Gorenstein ring then K b(proj A) has AR-
triangles. For higher dimensional Gorenstein rings we prove the following extension
of one direction of Happel’s result [8, 3.4].

Theorem 1.2. Let (A, m) be a complete Gorenstein local ring. Then K b
has AR-triangles.

f (proj A)

Remark 1.3. When A is complete then Theorem 1.1 ((i) =⇒ (ii)) follows from
Theorem 1.2. However even in the complete case it is relevant to prove Theorem1.1
directly. The reason is that the proof of Theorem 1.2 uses a non-trivial result due
to Neeman [14] while proof of Theorem1.1 is entirely self-contained.

We believe the converse to Theorem 1.2 is true. More precisely

Conjecture 1.4. Let (A, m) be a complete Noetherian local ring. If
K b

f (proj A) has AR-triangles then A is Gorenstein.

We prove Conjecture 1.4 under the following cases:

f (proj A) has AR-triangles. Then

Theorem 1.5. Let (A, m) be a complete Noetherian local ring. Assume
K b
(1) if A is Cohen-Macaulay then A is Gorenstein.
(2) if dim A = 1 then A is Gorenstein.
then A is Gorenstein.

If A is also Henselian then Cb(proj A) is also a Krull-Schmidt category.
It
then can be easily veriﬁed that K b(proj A) is also a Krull-Schmidt category. Let
K b
f (proj A) denote the complexes in K b(proj A) with ﬁnite cohomology. We give
two results which justify why we are concentrating on K b

f (proj A).

Our ﬁrst result is the following. In a Krull-Schmidt triangulated category we
may consider the notion of right (left) AR( Auslander-Reiten) triangles. We prove

Theorem 1.6. Let (A, m) be a Henselian commutative Noetherian local ring. Let
X• ∈ K b(proj A). If there is a right (left) AR-triangle ending at X• then H ∗(X•)
has ﬁnite length.

The techniques used to prove Theorem 1.6 are inspired by some techniques of

Yoshino, see [19, Chapter 2].

To state our second result we require some preliminaries: Let X• ∈ Cb(proj A)

be a minimal complex i.e ∂(X•) ⊆ mX•. Set

width X• = sup{i | Xi

• 6= 0} − inf{i | Xi

• 6= 0}

ON A GENERALIZATION OF TWO RESULTS OF HAPPEL TO COMMUTATIVE RINGS 3

and

rank X• =

rank Xi
•.

i
X
In general if X• ∈ Cb(proj A) then X• = U• ⊕ V• where U• is minimal complex
and V• is a ﬁnite direct sum of shifts of the complex 0 → A 1−→ A → 0. We set

width X• = width U•

and

rank X• = rank U•.

We note that if X• ∈ K b(proj A) then we can deﬁne width and rank of X• to be
same as considered as a complex in Cb(proj A). It can be easily seen that this is
well-deﬁned.

Our second result justifying study of K b

f (proj A) is

Theorem 1.7. Let T be a thick subcategory of K b(proj A) and let X• ∈ T . Let
m = width X• and r = rank X•. Suppose T has only ﬁnitely many complexes (upto
shift) with width ≤ 2m and rank ≤ 2r. Then H ∗(X•) has ﬁnite length.

The proof of the above result is an abstraction of a proof due to Huneke and
Leuschke, see [9, Theorem 1]. To get our abstraction we need an analogue of a
theorem of Miyata [13, Theorem 1]. Miyata proved that if R is a commutative
Noetherian ring and let Γ be an R- algebra which is ﬁnitely generated as a R-
module. Let M, N, L be ﬁnitely generated Γ modules such that there is an exact
sequence

s : 0 → M → N → L → 0

If N ∼= M ⊕ L then s is split.

Let C be a triangulated category. If s : M → N → L 0−→ M [1] is a triangle then it
is well-known that L ∼= N ⊕ M ; see [15, 1.2.7]. Our analogue of Miyata’s theorem
is as follows:

Theorem 1.8. Let Γ be a left Noetherian ring (not necessarily commutative). Sup-
pose we have a triangle in K −,b(proj Γ)
u−→ W•

v−→ U•[1],

w−→ V•

s : U•

such that W• ∼= U• ⊕ V• then v = 0 (equivalently there is ξ : V• → W• such that
w ◦ ξ = 1V•)).

We now describe in brief the contents of this paper. In section two we discuss
some preliminary results that we need. In section three we discuss some prelim-
inaries on AR-sequences that we need. In section four we prove that Db
f (A) is a
Krull-Schmidt category. In the next section we give a proof of Theorem 1.1( (i)
=⇒ (ii)). In section six we give a proof of Theorem 1.2. In section seven we discuss
a ﬁltration of certain DG-algebras that we need. In section eight we give a proof
of Theorem 1.1( (ii) =⇒ (i)). In section nine we give a proof of Theorem 1.5. In
the next section we give a proof of Theorem 1.6. In section eleven we prove our
analogue of Miyata’s theorem. Finally in section twelve we give a proof of Theorem
1.7.

We discuss a few preliminarly notions and results that we need.

2.1. (co-chain)-Complexes: Let Γ be a (not-necessarily commutative) left Noether-
ian ring. We will consider co-chain complexes over Γ

X• : · · · → Xi
•

∂i
−→ Xi+1

∂i+1
−−−→ Xi+2

• → · · ·

•
with ∂i+1 ◦ ∂i = 0 for all i. By H i(X•) we denote the ith cohomology of X•. By
the mth shift of X• we mean the co-chain complex X•[m] with X•[m]i = Xi+m
and diﬀerential d[m]i = (−1)mdi+m.

•

2.2. cones of maps: Let f : U• → V• be a co-chain map. Then by cone(f ) we
denote the co-chain complex with cone(f )n = Un+1
• with diﬀerential given by

• ⊕ Vn

∂n(u, v) = (−∂n+1(u), ∂n(v) − f n+1(u)).

We also have an exact sequence

(2.1)

0 → V• → cone(f ) → U•[1] → 0

where the left map sends v to (0, v) and the right map sends (u, v) to −u. We need
the following result

Lemma 2.3. Let r be in center of Γ. Let f : U• → V• be a map. Then we have a
commutative diagram

r

cone(f )

ψ

where the horizontal maps are as in 2.1 and j is the identity map on U•[1].

Proof. Deﬁne ψ as

ψ(u, v) = (u, rv).

The commutativity of the diagram can be easily veriﬁed.

(cid:3)

2.4. Triangulated categories:
We use [15] for notation on triangulated categories. However we will assume that
if C is a triangulated category then HomC(X, Y ) is a set for any objects X, Y of C.

2.5. By Cb(mod Γ) we mean the category of bounded co-chain complexes of ﬁnitely
generated left Γ-modules. Let K b(Γ) be the corresponding homotopy category.
Furthermore let Db(mod(Γ)) be its derived category. We note that K b(Γ) and
Db(mod(Γ)) are triangulated categories with shift functor [1]. Let C−,b(proj Γ) be
the category of bounded above complexes of ﬁnitely generated projective Γ-modules
with ﬁnitely generated cohomology and let K −,b(proj Γ) be the corresponding ho-
motopy category.
It is well-known that we have an equivalence of triangulated
categories K −,b(proj Γ) ∼= Db(mod(Γ)).

2.6. We now work over a commutative Noetherian ring A. We ﬁrst note that if
U•, V• ∈ K b(A) then it is easy to verify that for any prime P in A the natural
map

HomK b(A)(U•, V•)P → HomK b(AP )(U•P , V•P )

is an isomorphism. As a consequence we get

Corollary 2.7. Let (A, m) be a Noetherian local ring. Let X• ∈ K b(proj A) be
such that for any u ∈ HomK(proj A(X•, X•) and any r ∈ m we have rnu = 0 then
H ∗(X•) has ﬁnite length.
Proof. Let P 6= m be a prime. Our assumptions imply that

HomK(proj A)(X•, X•)P = 0.
By our earlier observation we get that HomK(proj AP )(X•P , X•P ) = 0. So X•P = 0.
It follows that H ∗(X•P ) = 0. Therefore H ∗(X•)P = 0. As P is any non-maximal
(cid:3)
prime the result follows.

2.8. Let U•, V• be complexes. The complex of homomorphisms from U• to V• is
a complex HomA(U•, V•) consisting of modules

HomA(U•, V•)n =

HomA(Ui

•, Vi+n
•

),

and diﬀerential deﬁned on a element f in HomA(U•, V•)n by

i
Y

∂(f ) = ∂V• ◦ f − (−1)nf ◦ ∂U• .

It is elementary to observe that

H 0(HomA(U•, V•)) = HomK(A)(U•, V•).
2.9. It is clear that if U•, V• ∈ Cb(mod(A)) then HomA(U•, V•) ∈ Cb(mod(A)).
Furthermore if P is a prime ideal in A then

(2.2)
2.10. Let U• ∈ Cb(proj A). Then set U∗
as a complex concentrated in degree zero. Clearly we have

HomA(U•, V•)P ∼= HomAP (U•P , V•P ).

f (proj A) to

K b(proj A) to K b(proj A) which also restricts to a functor from K b

•)) < ∞.

2.11. We can consider D as (covariant) functor from K b(proj A) → K b(proj A)op.
It is routine but tedious to verify that D is a triangulated functor and in-fact an
equivalence of triangulated categories.
2.12. Let Inj A denote the category of injective A-modules. Let K b(Inj A) be the
homotopy category of bounded complexes of injective A-modules. Let E denote the
injective hull of k = A/m. Let K b(E) be the thick category of K b(Inj A) generated
by E. Let E(−) = HomA(−, E). Then E : K b(proj A) → K b(E)op is a triangulated
functor.
2.13. Let (A, m) be a complete Noetherian local ring. Then by Matlis duality we
get HomA(E, E) = A. Using this fact it follows that for any X• ∈ K b(proj A) and
Q• ∈ K b(E) we have natural isomorphism of complexes
E(E(X•)) ∼= X•

and E(E(Q•)) ∼= Q•.

So the functor E : K b(proj A) → K b(E)op is an equivalence of categories.
2.14. If A is also Henselian then Cb(proj A) is also a Krull-Schmidt category. It
then can be easily veriﬁed that K b(proj A) is also a Krull-Schmidt category.

3. Preliminaries on AR-triangles

The notion of AR-triangles in a triangulated Krull-Schmidt category was intro-
duced by Happel [6, Chapter 1]. First note that the notion of split monomorphism
and split epimorphism makes sense in any triangulated category. They are called
section and retraction respectively in [6]. However in [6] AR-triangles are deﬁned
only in Hom-ﬁnite categories and in this case right AR-triangles are also left AR-
triangles (and vice-versa). However we need the notion of AR-triangles (both left
and right) in general. So in this section we carefully deﬁne the relevant notions.

Let C be a Krull-Schmidt triangulated category with shift functor

.

N in C is called a right AR-triangle (ending at

By considering the functor HomC(D, −) it is easy to see that (AR3) is equivalent

to

(RAR3l)

If D is indecomposable then for every non-isomorphism t : D → M

there exists q : D → E with g ◦ q = t.

It is also easy to see that (RAR3l) is equivalent to
(RAR3g)

If W is not-necessarily indecomposable and s : W → M is not a

retraction then there exists q : W → E with g ◦ q = s.

have t ◦ w = 0.

If D is indecomposable then for every non-isomorphism t : N → D we

By considering the functor HomC(−, D) it is easy to see that (LAR3) is equivalent

to

(LAR3l)

If D is indecomposable then for every non-isomorphism t : N → D

there exists q : E → D with q ◦ f = t.

It is also easy to see that (LAR3l) is equivalent to
(LAR3g) If W is not-necessarily indecomposable and s : N → W is not a section

then there exists q : E → W with q ◦ f = s.

Deﬁnition 3.1. We say a Krull-Schmidt triangulated category C has AR-triangles
if for any indecomposable M ∈ C there exists a right AR-triangle ending at M and
a left AR-triangle starting at M .

In [6, 1.4.2] it is proved that in a Hom-ﬁnite Krull-Schmidt category if N

Remark 3.4. It is shown in [6, 1.4.3] that AR triangles are unique up-to isomor-
phism of triangles. However the proof only works in Hom-ﬁnite categories. We
prove uniqueness of AR-triangles in C in general.

We ﬁrst prove:

Lemma 3.5. Let s : N
N be a triangle in C with N indecompos-
able and h 6= 0. Let θ : s → s be a morphism of triangles such that θM = 1M . Then
P
θ is an isomorphism of triangles.

f
−→ E

g
−→ M h−→

N is indecomposable. If u = θP N is not an isomorphism
Proof. We note that
then u is in the Jacobson radical of R = HomC(
N ). As s is a morphism of
P
triangles we get u ◦ h = h. Therefore (1R − u) ◦ h = 0. Note 1R − u is invertible.
This forces h = 0; a contradiction. So u is an isomorphism. It follows that θN is
an isomorphism. As θM , θN are isomorphisms it is well known that θE is also an
(cid:3)
isomorphism. So θ is an isomorphism of triangles.

N,

We now prove uniqueness of right AR-triangles in C.

Proposition 3.6. In C consider the following two right AR-triangles ending at M .

Then s ∼= s′.
Proof. As h, h′ are non-zero we get that g, g′ are not retractions; see [6, 1.4]. By
(AR3g) there exists lifts q : E′ → E and q′ : E → E′ lifting g′ and g respectively.
So we have morphism of triangles α : s → s′ and β : s′ → s with αM = βM = 1M .
Consider β ◦ α : s → s. As N is indecomposable and h 6= 0 we get by Lemma 3.5
that β ◦ α is an isomorphism. Similarly α ◦ β is an isomorphism. So s ∼= s′.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 3.7. Let s : N
N be a right AR-triangle ending at
M . Then by Proposition 3.6 N is determined by M (upto a not-necessarily unique
isomorphism). Set τ l(M ) = N .

Remark 3.8. Dually one can show that left AR-triangle starting at N are isomor-
phic.

We now concentrate on when C = K b(proj A) where (A, m) is a Henselian Noe-
therian local ring. We consider the behaviour under the duality operator. More
precisely we prove
Lemma 3.9. Let (A, m) be a Henselian Noetherian local ring. In K b(proj A) we

(1) Clearly U∗

• are indecomposable. Also as (h∗)∗ = h we get h∗ 6= 0. Let
D• ∈ K b(proj A) be indecomposable and let t : V∗
• → D• is not an isomorphism.
Then t∗ : D∗
• → V• is not an isomorphism. Also D∗
• is indecomposable. As s is an
AR-sequence ending at V• we get that h ◦ t∗ = 0. So t ◦ h∗ = 0. It follows that l
(cid:3)
is an AR-sequence starting at V∗
•.

3.10. As an application of Lemma 3.9 we give a proof of Proposition 3.3 in the
case of our interest.

Proof of 3.3 when C = K b(proj A). Let s be the given left AR-triangle. By 3.9 we
get that we have a right AR-triangle ending at N ∗.

l : M ∗ → E → N ∗ w

−−→ M [1]

∗

As H ∗(M ) has ﬁnite length it follows that H ∗(M ) has ﬁnite length. Thus
HomK b(proj A)(M ∗, M ∗) is Artinian. So by 3.2 the rotation of l

t : N ∗[−1]

[−1]

−w

is a left AR-triangle starting ar M ∗. So again by 3.9 we get a right AR triangle
ending at M ,

p : N → W → M

−w[1]
−−−−→ N [1]

is a right AR-triangle ending at M . As a triangle is determined upto isomorphism
(cid:3)
by any of its maps the result follows.

In a fundamental work Reiten and Van den Bergh, [16], related existence of
AR-triangles to existence of a Serre functor. Let (A, m) be a Noetherian local ring
and let E be the injective hull of k = A/m. Set (−)∨ = HomA(−, E). Let C be
a Hom-ﬁnite A-triangulated category. By a right Serre-functor on C we mean an
additive functor F : C → C such that we have isomorphism

ηC,D : HomC(C, D) → HomC(D, F (C))∨,

for any C, D ∈ C which are natural in C and D. It can be shown that if F is a
right Serre functor then F is fully faithful. If F is also dense then we call F to be
a Serre functor. We will use the following result:

Theorem 3.11. [see [16, Theorem I.2.4]] Let C be a Hom-ﬁnite A-linear triangu-
lated category. Then the following are equivalent

(i) C has AR-triangles.
(ii) C has a Serre-functor.

Remark 3.12. In [16], Theorem I.2.4 is proved for k-linear Hom-ﬁnite triangulated
categories where k is a ﬁeld. However the same proof generalizes to our situation.

4. Krull-Schmidt property of Db

f (A)

In this section we prove:

Lemma 4.1. Let (A, m) be a Noetherian local ring. Then Db
triangulated Krull-Schmidt category.

f (A) is a Hom-ﬁnite,

Proof. It is elementary that Db
it is a triangulated category.

f (A) is a thick subcategory of Db(A). So in particular

Next we prove that idempotents split in Db

f (A). Let e : X• →
X• be an idempotent. Then as idempotents split in Db(A) (see [1, 2.10] or [10,
Corollary A]) we have that there exists U• ∈ Db(A) and maps α : X• → U• and
β : U• → X• such that β ◦ α = e and α ◦ β = 1U• . Taking cohomology we get
an inclusion H i(β) : H i(U•) → H i(X•) for all i ∈ Z. It follows that U• ∈ Db
f (A).
Thus idempotents split in Db

f (A). Let X• ∈ Db

Set K = K−,b(proj A). It is well-known that Db(A) ∼= K. Let X•, Y• be bounded
f (A). Let F be a projective resolution of X• with F i ﬁnitely

complexes in Db
generated free A-modules and F i = 0 for i ≫ 0. Then we know that

f (A).

HomDb(A)(X•, Y•) ∼= HomK(F , Y•).
Let E = HomA(F , Y•) be the complex of homomorphisms from F to Y•; see
2.8. Then it is clear that E i = 0 for all i ≫ 0 and E i is ﬁnitely generated A-module
for all i ∈ Z (note Y• is a bounded complex). So H i(E) is a ﬁnitely generated
A-module for all i ∈ Z. In particular H 0(E)) = HomK(F , Y•) is ﬁnitely generated
A-module. Let P 6= m be a prime ideal in A. Set KP = K−,b(proj AP ).

We note that EP ∼= HomAP (FP , Y•P ). Furthermore

H 0(E))P ∼= HomKP (FP , Y•P ). But FP has zero homology. As it is bounnded
above we get that FP = 0 in KP . Thus H 0(E))P = 0 for any prime P 6= m. As
it is also ﬁnitely generated we get that H 0(E)) has ﬁnite length. Thus Db
f (A) is a
Hom-ﬁnite category

Next we show that any object in Db

f (A). Let c = h(X•) =

f (A) is a ﬁnite direct sum of indecomposable
i H i(X•). Then it is clear that
objects. Let X• ∈ Db
X• cannot be a direct sum of c + 1 non-zero complexes in Db
f (A). Thus X• is a
ﬁnite direct sum of indecomposable objects in Db
f (A) is Hom-ﬁnite with
split-idempotents it follows that the endomorphism rings of indecomposable objects
(cid:3)
are local, see [11, 1.1.5]. It follows that Db

P
f (A). As Db

f (A) is a Krull-Schmidt category.

5. Proof of Theorem 1.1( (i) =⇒ (ii))

In this section we give a proof of Theorem 1.1( (i) =⇒ (ii)). We need the

following preliminaries to prove our result.

5.1. Let (A, m) be a Noetherian local ring with residue ﬁeld k. Let E = E(k) the
injective hull of k. Let Y• ∈ Cb(mod(A)) and let X• ∈ Cb(proj A). Then note that
the natural map

ΨY•,X• : Y• ⊗ HomA(X•, A) → HomA(X•, Y•),

deﬁned by

is an isomorphism of complexes.

ΨY•,X• (y ⊗ f )(x) = f (x)y

10

5.2. Set

TONY J. PUTHENPURAKAL

D(−) = HomA(−, A) and E(−) = HomA(−, E).
By 5.1 we have that for any Y• ∈ Cb(mod(A)) and X• ∈ Cb(proj A) we have a
natural isomorphism

E(HomA(X•, Y•)) = HomA(HomA(X•, Y•), E),

∼= HomA(Y• ⊗ D(X•), E)
∼= HomA(Y•, E ◦ D(X•)).

5.3. Instead of working with Cb(mod(A)) it is bit convenient to work with C−,f g(A)
consisting of bounded complexes with ﬁnitely generated cohomology (the modules
in the complexes need not be ﬁnitely generated. Let K −,f g(A) be it’s homotopy
category. After inverting all quasi-isomorphisms we obtain D−,f g(A). It is easy to
show that D−,f g(A) ∼= Db(mod(A)). Also recall the equivalence from D−,f g(A) to
K −,b(proj A) (K +,b(Inj A))is given by the projective ( injective) resolution functor
p (i).
5.4. Now assume that (A, m) be a Henselian regular local ring. Consider the functor
F which is the following composite of A-linear functors:
p
−→ K b

f (proj A) D−→ K b

f (proj A) E−→ K b

f (proj A).

f (Inj A)

K b

Theorem 5.5. (with hypotheses as in 5.4) The functor F is dense.

We give a proof of Theorem 1.1 assuming Theorem 5.5.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Set (−)∨ = HomA(−, E). Then we have for X•, Y• ∈ K =
K b
f (proj A)

HomK(X•, Y•)∨ = (H 0(HomA(X•, Y•)))∨
∼= H 0(E(HomA(X•, Y•)))
∼= H 0(HomA(Y•, (E ◦ D)(X•)))
= HomK−,f g (A)(Y•, (E ◦ D)(X•))
∼= HomD−,f g (A)(Y•, (E ◦ D)(X•))
= HomD−,f g (A)(Y•, p((E ◦ D)(X•)))
∼= HomK(Y•, F (X•)).
Taking dual’s with respect to E again we get (as the A-modules considered have
ﬁnite length) an isomorphism

ηX•,Y• : HomK(X•, Y•) → HomK(Y•, F (X•))∨.
It can be easily seen that ηX•,Y• is natural in X• and Y•. So F is a right Serre-
functor on K. By 5.5 F is also dense. Thus F is a Serre-functor on K. By 3.11 we
(cid:3)
get that K has AR-triangles.

It remains to prove Theorem 5.5. We need a few preliminaries to prove this
result. The following result is essentially known. We give a proof due to lack of a
reference.

It follows that
H 0(X•) = k and H i(X•) = 0 for i < 0. Thus X• is a projective resolution of k. A
minimal injective resolution of k is the required injective resolution of X•.

• = 0 for j > 0.

Let ℓ(H ∗(X•)) = n and assume the result is proved for all complexes Y• with
ℓ(H ∗(Y•)) < n. We may assume that X• is minimal and Xj
• = 0 for j > 0. It
follows that W = H 0(X•) 6= 0. If H i(X•) = 0 for i 6= 0 then X• is a projective
resolution of W . A minimal injective resolution of W yields the required injective
resolution of X•. Next consider the case when H i(X•) 6= 0 for some i 6= 0. Let P•
be a minimal projective resolution of W . So we have a co-chain map ψ : X• → P•
which induces an isomorphism on H 0(−). It follows that H ∗(cone(ψ)) has length
< n. We have a triangle in K b(proj A)

X• → P• → cone(ψ) → X•[1].
We have an equivalence K b(proj A) → K b,f g(Inj A) obtained by taking injective
resolutions. So we have a triangle

By our induction hypotheses we can choose i(P•), i(cone(ψ)) of the required form.
Now notice that

i(X•)[1] ∼= cone(g).

The result follows.

Next we show

6. Proof of Theorem 1.2

In this section we prove Theorem 1.2. We need some preliminaries regarding
thick subcategories of a triangulated categories and its behaviour under triangulated
functors.

6.1. Let T be a triangulated category with shift functor
. Let I1, I2 be two
subcategories of T . We denote by I1 ∗ I2 the full subcategory of T consisting of
objects M such that there is a triangle M1 → M → M2 →
M1 with Mi ∈ Ii.
Let I be a full subcategory of T . By hIi we denote the smallest subcategory of T
containing I which is closed under ﬁnite direct sums, direct summands, shifts and
isomorphisms. Set I1 ⋄ I2 = hI1 ∗ I2i.

P

P

Set hIi0 = 0. Then inductively deﬁne hIii = hIii−1 ⋄ hIi. It is clear that hIii−1

is a subcategory of hIii for all i ≥ 1. Set

hIi∞ =

hIii.

[i≥0

6.2. Let I be a subcategory of T . By thick(I) we mean the intersection of all

hIi∞.

Let T , U be a triangulated categories and let F : T → U be a triangulated
functor. Let I be a subcategory of T . By F (I) we mean the full subcategory
of U consisting of objects F (M ) where M is an object of I. It is clear from 6.2
that F restricts to a triangulated functor Fr : thick(I) → thick(F (I)). If F is an

ON A GENERALIZATION OF TWO RESULTS OF HAPPEL TO COMMUTATIVE RINGS 13

equivalence with quasi-inverse G, then note that as GF (M ) ∼= M for all M we get
that G induces a triangulated functor Gr : thick(F (I)) → thick(I). It follows that
Fr is an equivalence with quasi-inverse Gr.
6.3. For the rest of this section we assume (A, m) is a complete Gorenstein local
ring of dimension d. We will use notation introduced in 2.11 and 2.13. Let S be
the category of ﬁnite length A-modules which also have ﬁnite projective dimension.
As A is Gorenstein each element M in S also has ﬁnite injective dimension.
If
M ∈ S then M ∨ = HomA(M, E) has ﬁnite injective dimension. As A is Gorenstein
it follows that M ∨ ∈ S. Thus we have a duality (−)∨ : S → Sop. Also note that
M ∨ ∼= Extd

A(M, A).

For each M ∈ S ﬁx a minimal projective resolution PM

Lemma 6.4. (with hypotheses as in 6.3) Consider the three equivalences
D : K b(proj A) → K b(proj A)op, E : K b(proj A) → K b(E)op and
p : K −,f g(Inj A) → K −,f g(proj A). Then
(1) D induces an equivalence Dr : Ff → F op
f .
(2) E induces an equivalence Er : Ff → I op

Remark 6.6. By Neeman’s classiﬁcation of thick subcategories of K b(proj A),
see [14, Lemma 1.2], it follows that K b
f (proj A) does not have proper thick subcate-
gories. So Ff = K b
f (proj A). We had to go through the whole strategy of the above
proof because 6.5 implies the following result of which I do not know a direct proof:

Proposition 6.7. Let X• ∈ K b
injective resolution i(X•) ∈ K b

f (proj A) and Y• ∈ K b

f (E) and a projective resolution p(Y•) ∈ K b

We now give

Proof of Theorem1.2. Just as in proof of Theorem 1.1 we have for
X•, Y• ∈ K b

f (proj A) an isomorphism

ηX•,Y• : HomFf (X•, Y•) → HomF (Y•, G(X•))∨.
It is easily veriﬁed that ηX•,Y• is natural in X• Y•. So G is a right Serre functor.
By 6.5 G is an equivalence. In particular G is dense. So G is a Serre-functor. So
(cid:3)
by 3.11, K b

f (proj A) has AR-triangles.

7. A filtration of certain DG-algebras

We will need to recall a few basic results. Let A be a Noetherian ring. We will
recall Tate’s construction of DG-resolution of A/I where I is an ideal in A, see [18].

7.1. An associative algebra X• over A is called an non-positive DG-algebra over A
if the following hypotheses are satisﬁed:

n≤0 Xn

• with each Xi

• a ﬁnitely gener-

(1) X• is non-positively graded X• =
• ⊆ Xi+j

ated A-module and Xi

•Xj

•

for all i, j ≤ 0.
L
• such that X0
• = A1.

(2) X• has a unit element 1 ∈ X0
(3) X• is strictly skew-commutative; (for homogeneous element x ∈ Xi

• set

|x| = i) For homogeneous elements x, y we have

(i) x.y = (−1)|x||y|yx.
(ii) x2 = 0 if |x| is odd.

(4) There exists a skew derivation d : X• → X• such that

• ) ⊆ Xn+1

(i) d(Xn
(ii) d2 = 0.
(iii) For x, y homogeneous,

•

for all n ≤ 0.

The map d is called skew derivation on X•.

d(xy) = d(x)y + (−1)|x|xd(y).

7.2. Next we recall Tate’s process of killing cycles; [18, section 2]. Let X• be a
non-positive DG-algebra. Let ρ < 0 be a negative integer. Let t ∈ Z ρ+1(X•) be a
cycle of degree ρ + 1.

Case 1: ρ is odd. Let Y• = A ⊕ AT be the exterior power algebra with degree

of A is zero and deg T = ρ and T 2 = 0
Case 2: ρ is even. Let Y• =
T0 = 1) and multiplication deﬁned by
L

j≤0 ATj with ATj ∼= A in degree −jρ (with

TiTj =

(|i| + |j|)!
|i|!|j|!
In both cases X• ⊗ Y• is again a non-positive DG-algebra. Furthermore there is a
unique skew-derivation d on Y• extending that on X• = X• ⊗ 1 with d(T ) = t in
case (1) and d(Tj) = tTj+1 for all j in case (2). Furthermore we get H q(X• ⊗ Y•) =
H q(A) for q > ρ + 1 and H ρ+1(X• ⊗ Y•) = H ρ+1(X•)/At.

Ti+j.

Remark 7.3. Following Tate we denote in both cases X• ⊗ Y• = X• < T > with
d(T ) = t.

7.4. Let X• be a non-positive DG-algebra over A. We assume Xi
• is a ﬁnitely
generated free A-module for all i ≤ 0 and ℓ(H ∗(X•)n) < ∞ for all n ∈ Z. By a
good ﬁltration F = {F•(i)}i≥0 of X• we mean

(1) F•(i) is a sub-complex of X• with F•(i)n a direct summand of Xn

• for all

n ≤ 0.

(2) F•(i) ⊆ F•(i + 1) for all i ≥ 0 and
(3) F•(i)n is a direct summand of F•(i + 1)n for all n ≤ 0.
(4) There exists c depending on X• and F such that

i≥0 F•(i) = X•.

S

F•(i)nF•(j)m ⊆ F•(i + j + c)n+m.

(5) ℓ(H ∗(F•(i))) < ∞ for all i ≥ 1.

ON A GENERALIZATION OF TWO RESULTS OF HAPPEL TO COMMUTATIVE RINGS 15

We call c the parameter of F . The main result of this section is

Theorem 7.5. (with hypotheses as in 7.4.) Let ρ < 0 be such that H i(X•) = 0 for
0 > i ≥ ρ + 2. Suppose H ρ+1(X•) 6= 0 and let t ∈ Z ρ+1(X•) be a cycle of degree
ρ + 1 such that its residue class in H ρ+1(X•) is non-zero. Let Z• = X• < T > with
d(T ) = t. Then Z• also has a good ﬁltration as discussed in 7.4.

Proof. Let F be a good ﬁltration of X• with parameter c. Suppose t ∈ F•(r)ρ+1.
We have to consider two cases.
Case (1): ρ is odd. Note Z•

T . Set G = {G•(i)}i≥0 where

n ⊕ Xn−ρ

n = X•

•

G•(i)n = F•(i + r + c)n ⊕ F•(i)n−ρT

We ﬁrst show that G•(i) is a sub-complex of Z•. Let gn = (f (i+r+c)n, f (i)n−ρT ) ∈
G•(i)n. Then note that

d(gn) = d(f (i + r + c)n) + (−1)n−ρf (i)n−ρt + d(f (i)n−ρT.

We note that

f (i)n−ρt ∈ F•(i)n−ρF•(r)ρ+1 ⊆ F•(i + r + c)n+1.

Thus d(G•(i)n) ⊆ G•(i)n+1. It follows that G•(i) is a sub-complex of Z•. Clearly
hypotheses (1), (2), (3) is satisﬁed. We note that

G•(i)nG•(j)m = (F•(i + r + c)n ⊕ F•(i)n−ρT ) · (F•(j + r + c)m ⊕ F•(j)m−ρT )

⊆ F•(i + j + 2r + 3c)n+m ⊕ F•(i + j + r + 2c)n+m−ρT
= G•(i + j + r + 2c)n+m.

So G has parameter r + 2c. We have a short exact sequence of complexes

0 → F•(i + r + c) α−→ G(i)

β
−→ F•(i)[−ρ] → 0,

where α is the usual inclusion and

(*)

βn(∗, xn−ρT ) = (−1)nxn−ρ.

Note as ρ is odd we get that β is a chain map.The face that (∗) is a short exact
sequence of complexes is clear. As ℓ(H ∗(F•(i + r + c))) and ℓ(H ∗(F•(i))) are ﬁnite
it follows that ℓ(H ∗(G•(i))) is also ﬁnite. Thus hypotheses (4) of 7.4 is satisﬁed.
So G is a good ﬁltration of Z•.

Case (2): ρ is even. We note that

Zn

• = Xn

• ⊕ Xn−ρ

•

T−1 ⊕ Xn−2ρ

•

T−2 ⊕ · · ·

Set G = {G•(i)}i≥0 where

−i

G•(i)n =

F•((i + l)(r + c))n+ρlTl

Ml=0

We ﬁrst show that G•(i) is a sub-complex of Z•. Let l with −i ≤ l ≤ 0 be ﬁxed.
Let u = aTl ∈ G•(i)n. Then

d(u) = d(a)Tl + (−1)|a|atTl+1.

16

TONY J. PUTHENPURAKAL

We note that d(a)Tl ∈ G•(i)n+1. Furthermore

atTl+1 ∈ F•((j + l)(r + c))n+ρlF•(r)ρ+1Tl+1,

⊆ F•((j + l)(r + c) + r + c)n+ρl+ρ+1Tl+1
= F•((j + l + 1)(r + c))n+1+ρ(l+1)Tl+1,
⊆ G•(i)n+1.

Thus G•(i) is a sub-complex of Z•. Clearly hypotheses (1), (2), (3) is satisﬁed. Let
u = aTl1 ∈ F•((j + l1)(r + c))n+ρl1 Tl1 and v = bTl1 ∈ F•((i + l2)(r + c))m+ρl2 Tl2.
Then

uv ∈ F•((j + l1)(r + c))n+ρl1 F•((i + l2)(r + c))m+ρl2 Tl1+l2,
⊆ F•((j + l1 + i + l2)(r + c) + c)n+ρl1+m+ρl2Tl1+l2 ,
⊆ G•(i + j + 1)n+m.

So G has parameter 1.

Next we show that ℓ(H ∗(G•(i))) < ∞ for all i ≥ 0. Fix i ≥ 0. Set for s = 0, . . . , i,

−s

K•(i, s)n =

F•((i + l)(r + c))n+ρlTl

Ml=0

It is straight forward that K•(i, s) is a sub-complex of G•(i) and K•(i, i) = G•(i).
We prove by induction on s that H ∗(K•(i, s)) has ﬁnite length for all s. For s = 0
we have K•(i, 0) = F•((i)(r + c)) and so by our hypotheses ℓ(H ∗(K•(i, 0))) has
ﬁnite length. Let s ≥ 1. Note we have an obvious short exact sequence of complexes

0 → K•(i, s − 1) → K•(i, s) → F•((i − s)(r + c))[−ρs] → 0
Note by our hypotheses ℓ(H ∗(F•((i − s)(r + c))) has ﬁnite length. Furthermore
by induction hypotheses H ∗(K•(i, s − 1)) has ﬁnite length. Thus by induction
H ∗(K•(i, s)) has ﬁnite length for s = 0, . . . , i. In particular for i = s we get that
(cid:3)
H ∗(G•(i)) has ﬁnite length. Thus G is a good ﬁltration of Z•.

Remark 7.6. Let I be an ideal in A such that A/I has ﬁnite length. Let X• be
the Koszul complex on a set of generators of I. Then H ∗(X•) has ﬁnite length.
Then if Y• is any step in the Tate resolution of A/I begining at X• then Y• has
a good ﬁltration.

8. Proof of Theorem 1.1( (ii) =⇒ (i))

In this section we prove:

Theorem 8.1. Let (A, m) be a Noetherian local ring. If Db
then A is regular local.

f (A) has AR-triangles

f (A) with K −,b

Throughout we identify Db

(proj A) the homotopy category of
bounded above complexes of ﬁnitely generated free A-modules with ﬁnite length
cohomology. Let X• be a minimal projective resolution of k. Then clearly X•
is indecomposable in K −,b
(proj A). We will use a result independently proved by
Gulliksen [3] and Schoeller [17], i.e., one can use the Tate process to yield a minimal
resolution of k. Theorem 8.1 follows from the following result:

Proposition 8.3. Let (A, m) be a Noetherian local ring. Let U• ∈ K −,b

9. Proof of Theorem 1.5

In this section we give a proof of Theorem 1.5. We restate it for the convenience

of the reader.

f (proj A) has AR-triangles.

Theorem 9.1. Let (A, m) be a complete Noetherian local ring. Assume
K b
(1) if A is Cohen-Macaulay then A is Gorenstein.
(2) if dim A = 1 then A is Gorenstein.
then A is Gorenstein.

We will need the following result:

Proposition 9.2. Let (A, m), (B, n) be Henselian local rings. Let
X• ∈ K b
f (proj A) be a minimal complex with width X• = l. Then
(1) If X• = 0 → Fl → · · · → F0 → 0 then µ(Hom(X•, X•[l])) = rank(Fl) rank(F0).

(2) Hom(X•, X•[j]) =

6= 0
= 0
f (proj A) → K b

(

if l = j
for j > l

(3) Let F : K b

f (proj B) be an equivalence commuting with [1]. Then

for any X• ∈ K b

f (proj A) we have width X• = width F (X•).

Proof. (1) We note that if f ∈ Hom(X•, X•[l]) is null-homotopic then
f ∈ m HomA(Fl, F0). The result follows.

(2) The ﬁrst assertion follows from (1). The second is obvious.
(3) We have Hom(X•, X•[l]) ∼= Hom(F (X•), F (X•)[l]) 6= 0. So width F (X•) ≤
width X•. By considering F −1 we obtain the reverse inequality. The result follows.
(cid:3)

We now give

Proof of Theorem 9.1(1). If dim A = 0 then result holds by [8, 3.4]. So assume d =
dim A > 0. Let x1, . . . , xd be a system of parameters of A. Set I = (x1, .., xd). Let
X• be a minimal resolution of A/I. As K b
f (proj A) has AR-triangles we have a Serre
f (proj A) with Hom(X•, X•) ∼= Hom(X•, F (X•))∨.
f (proj A) → K b
functor F : K b
We note that F is an equivalence. So by 9.2, d = width X• = width F (X•). By

ON A GENERALIZATION OF TWO RESULTS OF HAPPEL TO COMMUTATIVE RINGS 19

acyclicity lemma we get that F (X•) is a minimal resolution of some ﬁnite length
module M (upto shift). Note

A/I = Hom(X•, X•[d]) ∼= Hom(F (X•), F (X•)[d]).
So by 9.2(1) we get that M is cyclic, say M = A/J. We note that
A/I = Hom(X•, X•) ∼= Hom(F (X•), F (X•)) = A/J.

So I = J. So we have

(A/I)∨ = Hom(X•, X•)∨ ∼= Hom(X•, F (X•)) = (A/I)( d
m)

for some m. Counting lengths we get that m = 0 or d. Furthermore as

(A/I)∨ ∼= A/I
we get that A/I is a Gorenstein ring. As x1, . . . , xd is an A-regular sequence we
(cid:3)
get that A is Gorenstein.

Let Γ(A) be the ideal of m-torsion elements of A. To prove Theorem 9.1(2) we

need the following result:
Proposition 9.3. Let (A, m) be a one-dimensional complete Noetherian local ring.
Then there exists a parameter x of A with (x) ∩ Γ(A) = 0.

Proof. Let y be a parameter of A. By Artin-Rees Lemma there exists t ≥ 1 such
that for n ≫ 0 we have

(y)n ∩ Γ(A) = (y)n−t((y)t ∩ Γ(A).
We note that (y)n−t((y)t ∩ Γ(A) = 0 for n ≫ 0. Taking x = yn for n suﬃciently
(cid:3)
large yields our result.

We now give

Proof of Theorem 9.1(2). By (1) it suﬃces to show A is Cohen-Macaulay. Suppose
if possible A is not Cohen-Macaulay. So depth A = 0. In particular Γ(A) 6= 0. By
9.3 we can choose a parameter x of A with (x) ∩ Γ(A) = 0. Let

X• : 0 → A x−→ A → 0,
concentrated in degrees 0.−1. Note H 0(X•) = A/(x) and H −1(X•) = (0 : x). Note
ℓ(H 0(X•)) > ℓ(H −1(X•)); see [2, 4.7.6]. As K b
f (proj A) has AR-triangles we have
a Serre functor F : K b

f (proj A) → K b

f (proj A) with

Hom(X•, X•) ∼= Hom(X•, F (X•))∨.

We note that F is an equivalence. So by 9.2, 1 = width X• = width F (X•). So

F (X•) : 0 → Am → An → 0.

As ℓ(H ∗(F (X•)) < ∞ it easily follows that m = n.

As F is an equivalence we get that

Hom(X•, X•[1]) ∼= Hom(F (X•), F (X•)[1]).

It is easily veriﬁed that Hom(X•, X•[1]) = A/(x). By 9.2(1) we get that

So m = 1. Let

µ(Hom(F (X•), F (X•)[1])) = m2.

F (X•) : 0 → A

y
−→ A → 0.

20

TONY J. PUTHENPURAKAL

Note Hom(F (X•), F (X•)[1]) = A/(y). So (x) = (y). In particular y = λx where λ
is a unit. Thus F (X•) = X•[s] for some s.

As Hom(X•, F (X•))∨ ∼= Hom(X•, X•) 6= 0, we get s = 1, 0, −1. We will show
that s = −1 is not possible. Furthermore we show that in both cases s = 0, 1 we
get depth A > 0. This will prove our result.

Case 1: s = −1. It is easily veriﬁed that Hom(X•, X•[−1]) = (0 : x). The natural
map A → Hom(X•, X•) has kernel (x). Thus we have a natural map η : A/(x) →
Hom(X•, X•). Also note that if f ∈ Hom(X•, X•) Then H 0(f ) : A/(x) → A/(x) is
A-linear. Furthermore H 0(−) ◦ η = 1A/(x). So we have Hom(X•, X•) = A/(x) ⊕ L
for some ﬁnitely generated A-module L. So we have
A/(x)⊕L = Hom(X•, X•) ∼= Hom(X•, F (X•))∨ = Hom(X•, X•[−1]))∨ = (0 : x))∨.

So we have ℓ(A/(x)) ≤ ℓ(0 : x) which is a contradiction.

Case 2: s = 1. We have

A/(x) ⊕ L = Hom(X•, X•) ∼= Hom(X•, F (X•))∨ = Hom(X•, X•[1]))∨ = (A/x))∨.

Computing lengths we have L = 0. So the natural map η : A/(x) → Hom(X•, X•)
is an isomorphism. Let t ∈ (0 : m) be non-zero. Consider the following chain map
ψ : X• → X• where ψ0 = 0 and ψ−1 is multiplication by t. As η is an isomorphism
we get that ψ is multiplication by some α ∈ A. So η(α) − ψ is null-homotopic say
deﬁned by s : X0
• . Then sx = α and sx = α − t. So t = 0 a contradiction.

• → X−1
Case 3: s = 0. In this case we have

S = Hom(X•, X•) ∼= Hom(X•, F (X•))∨ = Hom(X•, X•))∨
Note as X• is indecomposable we get that S is a local Artin A-algebra. As S ∼= S∨
we get that S is self-injective. So S has one-dimensional socle. Let φ ∈ S. Say
φ0, φ−1 are multiplication by u, v respectively. Then clearly u is a unit if and only
if v is a unit. Furthermore if both u, v are units then φ is an isomorphism. Thus
φ ∈ rad(S) if and only if both u, v ∈ m.

Let t ∈ (0 : m) be non-zero. Let α : X• → X• be deﬁned by α0 = 0 and α−1 is
multiplication by t. Also deﬁne β : X• → X• by β−1 = 0 and β0 is multiplication
by t. Then α, β ∈ socle of S. Furthermore it is easily veriﬁed that α 6= 0 and β 6= 0.
So α = θ ◦ β for some unit θ ∈ S. So α − θ ◦ β is null-homotopic say deﬁned by
s : X0

• . Note we get sx = t. So t ∈ (x) which contradicts our choice of x.

• → X−1

Thus depth A > 0. So A is Cohen-Macaulay. By (1) we also get that A is
(cid:3)

Gorenstein.

10. Proof of Theorem 1.6
In this section we give a proof of Theorem 1.6. Throughout (A, m) is a Henselian

Noetherian local ring. Set K = K b(proj A).

10.1. Let X• ∈ K be an indecomposable minimal complex. Set

S(X•) = {s : X•[−1]

us−→ U•s → K•s → X• |
s is a triangle in K with U•s indecomposable and us 6= 0}.

Our ﬁrst result is

Lemma 10.2. (with hypotheses as in 10.1) S(X•) is non-empty.

ON A GENERALIZATION OF TWO RESULTS OF HAPPEL TO COMMUTATIVE RINGS 21

Proof. Let t : 0 → V• → P• → X• → 0 be a short exact sequence in Cb(mod(A))
It is well known that P• is a ﬁnite direct sum of shifts of
with P• projective.
complex of the form 0 → A 1−→ A → 0. Thus t is a short exact sequence in
Cb(proj A). So we have a triangle in K

l : X•[−1] u−→ V• → P• → X•.

We assert that u 6= 0. Otherwise l is split. So V• is a direct summand of P•. But
P• = 0 in K. So V• = 0 in K. This forces H ∗(V•) = 0. Taking long exact sequence
in cohomology induced by t we get H ∗(X•) = 0. So by 11.1 we get X• = 0 in K, a
contradiction.

Say V• = V•(1) ⊕ V•(2) · · · ⊕ V•(r) with V•(i) indecomposable in K for all i.
Let u = (u1, . . . , ur) along this decomposition. As u 6= 0 some ui 6= 0. We note
that ui induces a triangle

s : X•[−1]

ui−→ V•(i) → K• → X•.

It follows that S(X•) is non-empty.

(cid:3)

10.3. A partial order on S(X•). Let s, t ∈ S(X•). We say s > t if there is a
morphism of triangles s → t

X•[−1]

U•s

K•s

X•

j

X•[−1]

/ U•t

/ K•t

/ X•

where j is the identity map.

We ﬁrst prove:

Lemma 10.4. (with hypotheses as in 10.1) If s > t and t > s then s ∼= t.

Proof. We compose the two morphism s → t and t → s to obtain a morphism
s → s

X•[−1]

j

X•[−1]

U•s

h

/ U•s

K•s

X•

/ K•s

/ X•

where j is the identity map. If h is not an isomorphism then as U•s is indecompos-
able we get that h is in the Jacobson radical of R = HomK(U•s, U•s). We obtain
h ◦ us = us. So we get (1 − h) ◦ us = 0. As h is in the Jacobson radical of R we
get that 1 − h is invertible. So us = 0, a contradiction. So h is an isomorphism.
It follows that the above diagram is an isomorphism. Similarly the composite of
t → s and s → t is an isomorphism t → t. It follows that s ∼= t.
(cid:3)

Thus we have a well-deﬁned partial order on S(X•). To be completely precise

one has to identify elements of S(X•) upto isomorphism.

Next we show that S(X•) is directed,i.e,

Lemma 10.5. (with hypotheses as in 10.1) If s, t ∈ S(X•) then there exists l ∈
S(X•) with s > l and t > l.

Proof. We write

s : X•[−1]

t : X•[−1]

us−→ U•s → K•s
ut−→ U•t → K•t

ps−→ X•
pt−→ X•

Claim: The map (ps, pt) : K•s ⊕ K•t → X• is not a retraction.
Otherwise there exists qs : X• → K•s and qt : X• → K•t with

ps ◦ qs + pt ◦ qt = 1X• .

As X• is indecomposable this implies that ps ◦ qs or pt ◦ qt is an automorphism
on X•. This implies that ps or pt is a retraction. So us = 0 or ut = 0 which is a
contradiction.

Consider the triangle

α : X•[−1] v−→ V• → K•s ⊕ K•t

(ps,pt)
−−−−→ X•.

As (ps, pt) is not a retraction we get that v 6= 0. Say V• = V•(1) ⊕ V•(2) · · · ⊕
V•(r) with V•(i) indecomposable in K for all i. Let v = (v1, . . . , vr) along this
decomposition. As v 6= 0 some vi 6= 0. We note that vi induces a triangle

l : X•[−1]

vi−→ V•(i) → K•l → X•.

with l ∈ S(X•). We have a map α → l,

X•[−1]

where j is the identity map and i is the obvious inclusion. Composing s → α with
(cid:3)
α → l we obtain a map s → l. So s > l. Similarly t > l. The result follows.

Thus by the 10.5 and 10.4 if there is a minimum element in S(X•) it is unique

upto isomorphism of triangles.

The utility of the construction of S(X•) is that it gives a convenient way to

handle left AR-triangles. We show

Theorem 10.6. Let s : X•[−1] w−→ U• → K• → X• be a triangle in K. Then the
following conditions are equivalent:

(1) s is a left AR-triangle starting at U•.
(2) s is the minimal element of S(X•).

ON A GENERALIZATION OF TWO RESULTS OF HAPPEL TO COMMUTATIVE RINGS 23

Proof. We ﬁrst prove (2) =⇒ (1). By construction of S(X•) we get that X•, U•
are indecomposable and w 6= 0. Let D• ∈ K be indecomposable and let t : U• → D•
be a non-isomorphism. Then we have a morphism of triangles

X•[−1] w

j

U•

t

K•

X•

X•[−1] t◦w /

/ D•

/ P•

/ X•

where j is the identity map and P• = cone(t ◦ w). Let l denote the lower triangle
above. If t ◦ w 6= 0 then l ∈ S(X•). Furthermore s > l. But s is the minimal
element in S(X•). So l > s. By 10.4 we get s ∼= l. So t is an isomorphism, a
contradiction.

We now prove (1) =⇒ (2). Suppose if possible s is not minimal element in

S(X•). Then s > l and s ≇ l for some l ∈ S(X•). So we have

X•[−1] w

j

U•

t

K•

X•

X•[−1]

ul

/ U•l

/ K•l

/ X•

where j is the identity map. So we get ul = t ◦ w. But ul 6= 0 and t is a non-
(cid:3)
isomorphism. This contradicts the fact that s is a left AR-triangle.

Next we show

Theorem 10.7. Let s : X•[−1] w−→ U• → K• → X• be a left AR-triangle in K.
Then H ∗(X•) has ﬁnite length.

Proof. By 10.6 we get that s is the minimal element of S(X•). Suppose if possible
H ∗(X•) does not have ﬁnite length. Let P be a non-maximal prime such that
H ∗(X•)P 6= 0. So H ∗(X•P ) 6= 0. Let t : 0 → V• → P• → X• → 0 be a short exact
sequence in Cb(mod(A)) with P• projective. It is well known that P• is a ﬁnite
direct sum of shifts of complex of the form 0 → A 1−→ A → 0. Thus t is a short
exact sequence in Cb(proj A). So we have a triangle in K
l : X•[−1] v−→ V• → P• → X•.
By considering tP it follows that V•P 6= 0 in K(proj AP ). Note we have a triangle

lP : X•P [−1]

vP−−→ V•P → P•P → X•P .

But P• is a contractible complex and so is P•P . If vP is zero then lP splits and
this forces V•P = 0 a contradiction.

Say V• = V•(1) ⊕ V•(2) ⊕ · · · ⊕ V•(r) with V•(i) indecomposable in K for all
i. Let v = (v1, . . . , vr) along this decomposition. As vP 6= 0 some (vi)P 6= 0. We
note that vi induces a triangle in S(X•).

q : X•[−1]

vi−→ V•(i) → Q• → X•.

Let α ∈ m \ P . As (vi)P 6= 0 we get that αnvi 6= 0. So for all n ≥ 1 we have a
triangle qn ∈ S(X•) where

qn : X•[−1]

αnvi−−−→ V•(i) → Q•n → X•.

(cid:3)
which is a contradiction.

We now give a proof of Theorem 1.6. We restate it in a convenient form.

Theorem 10.8. In K we have
(1) If s : X•[−1] w−→ U• → K• → X• is a left AR-triangle then H ∗(X•), H ∗(U•)

and H ∗(K•) has ﬁnite length.

(2) If t : U• → K• → X•

h−→ U•[1] is a right AR-triangle then H ∗(X•), H ∗(U•)

and H ∗(K•) has ﬁnite length.

Proof. (1) By 10.7 we get that H ∗(X•) has ﬁnite length. So HomK(X•, X•) is
Artin local. From 3.3 we have a right AR-triangle

In this section we prove our analogue to Miyata’s theorem. We will need the

following well-known result

Lemma 11.1. Let Γ be a left Noetherian ring. Let X•, F•, G• ∈ K −,b(proj Γ).
We have
(1) If H i(X•) = 0 for all i ∈ Z then X• = 0.
(2) Let u : F• → G•.

If H i(u) is an isomorphism for all i ∈ Z then u is an

ON A GENERALIZATION OF TWO RESULTS OF HAPPEL TO COMMUTATIVE RINGS 25

Proof of Theorem 1.8. Let θ = (α, β) : W• → U• ⊕ V• be an isomorphism. Let
t : U• → U• ⊕ V• → V•

0−→ U•[1] be the obvious split triangle.

We note that i ◦ (α ◦ u) = θ ◦ u. So there exists h : V• → V• which induces a map
of triangles s → t. Taking cohomology we get a commutative diagram

H i(U•)

/ H i+1(U•)

As H i(θ) is an isomorphism and H i(π) is surjective a simple diagram chase shows
that H i(h) is surjective. As H i(V•) is ﬁnitely generated Γ-module and as Γ is
left Noetherian we get that H i(h) is an isomorphism. By 11.1 we get that h is an
isomorphism. It follows that α◦u is also an isomorphism. Thus the map of triangles
s → t is an isomorphism. A simple diagram chase shows that v : V• → U•[1] is
(cid:3)
zero.

12. Proof of Theorem 1.7

In this section we give

Proof of Theorem 1.7. Let u ∈ Hom(X•, X•) be any. Let r ∈ m be any. Set
K•(n) = cone(rnu). We have triangle

X•

rnu−−→ X• → K•(n) → X•[1]

We note that K•(n) ∈ T . Furthermore width K•(n) ≤ width X• + 1 and
rank K•(n) ≤ 2 rank X•. So by our assumption we get that K•(n) ∼= K•(m) in
K b(proj A) for some n < m. Set v = rnu and t = rm−n. We will show v = 0. By
2.7 it follows that H ∗(X•) has ﬁnite length. Note by 2.3 we have a commutative
diagram in Cb(mod(A))

where j is the identity map. We now note that Cb(mod(A)) is an abelian category.
It follows that K•(m) is the pushout of i and the multiplication map on X• by t.
So we have

K•(m) ∼=

X• ⊕ K•(n)
{(tx, −i(x)) | x ∈ X•}

.

So we have an exact sequence in Cb(mod(A)),

0 → X•

(t,−i)
−−−−→ X• ⊕ K•(n) → K•(m) → 0.

The above exact sequence consists of objects in Cb(proj A). So we have a triangle
in K b(proj A)

X•

(t,−i)
−−−−→ X• ⊕ K•(n) → K•(m)

g
−→ X•[1].

As K•(n) ∼= K•(m) in K b(proj A) it follows by our analogue of Miyata’s theorem
that g = 0 and so the above triangle is split. Using the functor Hom(X•[1], −) on
the above triangle we get that the map

θ : Hom(X•[1], X•[1])

∗

∗

[1],−i

(t
−−−−−−−−→ Hom(X•[1], X•[1] ⊕ K•(n)[1])

[1])

is a split injection and denote it’s left inverse by δ.

We also have a triangle in K b(proj A)

X•

v−→ X•

i−→ K•(n) → X•[1].

Using the functor Hom(X•[1], −) on the above triangle we get an exact sequence

Hom(X•[1], X•[1])

∗

v[1]
−−−→ Hom(X•[1], X•[1])

[1]

∗
i
−−−→ Hom(X•[1], K•(n)[1]).

It follows that

So we get

Applying δ we get

i∗[1](v[1]) = (i∗[1] ◦ v∗[1])(1X•[1]) = 0.

θ(v[1]) = (tv[1], 0).

v[1] = tδ(v[1], 0)

= tδ(tδ(v[1], 0), 0)
= t2δ(δ(v[1], 0), 0)

Iterating we get that v[1] is inﬁnitely divisible by t. So v[1] = 0. Thus v = 0.
