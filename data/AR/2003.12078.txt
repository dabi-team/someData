ABSTRACT
Traditionally, the strongest magnetic ﬁelds on the Sun have been measured in sunspot umbrae. More recently,
however, much stronger ﬁelds have been measured at the ends of penumbral ﬁlaments carrying the Evershed and
counter-Evershed ﬂows. Superstrong ﬁelds have also been reported within a light bridge separating two umbrae
of opposite polarities. We aim to accurately determine the strengths of the strongest ﬁelds in a light bridge
using an advanced inversion technique and to investigate their detailed structure. We analyze observations from
the spectropolarimeter on board the Hinode spacecraft of the active region AR 11967. The thermodynamic
and magnetic conﬁgurations are obtained by inverting the Stokes proﬁles using an inversion scheme that allows
multiple height nodes. Both the traditional 1D inversion technique and the so-called 2D coupled inversions,
which take into account the point spread function of the Hinode telescope, are used. We ﬁnd a compact structure
with an area of 32.7 arcsec2 within a bipolar light bridge with ﬁeld strengths exceeding 5 kG, conﬁrming the
strong ﬁelds in this light bridge reported in the literature. Two regions associated with downﬂows of ∼5 km s−1
harbor ﬁeld strengths larger than 6.5 kG, covering a total area of 2.97 arcsec2. The maximum ﬁeld strength
found is 8.2 kG, which is the largest ever observed ﬁeld in a bipolar light bridge up to now.

1. INTRODUCTION

Sunspots are the most striking magnetic features at the so-
lar surface. Their darkness relative to their surroundings is
caused by the strong magnetic ﬁelds they harbor, which sup-
press convective energy transport (e.g., Solanki 2003; Rem-
pel & Schlichenmaier 2011).
It is unclear, however, how
strong the ﬁeld in sunspots can be and, in particular, where
in sunspots the strongest ﬁelds are found.

Livingston et al. (2006) investigated archives from three
diﬀerent observatories that gathered data from 1917 to 2004,
ﬁnding 55 spots with magnetic ﬁeld strengths larger than
4 kG, with the strongest ﬁeld being 6.1 kG. These authors
found these strong ﬁelds inside the darkest parts of the
sunspot umbrae. Equally strong or even stronger ﬁelds have
been reported in highly sheared regions, where two active
regions (ARs) with diﬀerent polarities collide (e.g., Zirin &
Wang 1993; Wang et al. 2018). Thus, Wang et al. (2018)
reported ﬁelds of 5.57 kG measured directly from the Zee-
man splitting of the Fe I 1.5648 µm spectral line. Okamoto
& Sakurai (2018) obtained magnetic ﬁeld strengths up to

6.25 kG inside the light bridge of AR 11967 by ﬁtting the
observed Stokes proﬁles assuming a Milne-Eddington (ME)
type atmosphere. These authors stated that their measure-
ments correspond to the strongest ﬁeld ever reported directly
deduced from Zeeman splitting in Stokes I.

Recently two locations harboring very strong ﬁelds were
detected in two diﬀerent parts of the penumbra (van Noort
et al. 2013; Siu-Tapia et al. 2017, 2019). The ﬁrst de-
tected region is located at endpoints of penumbral ﬁlaments.
The strong ﬁelds are related to strong and often supersonic
downﬂows (van Noort et al. 2013). These authors obtained
ﬁeld strengths reaching up to 7.25 kG in the deepest layers
accessible to observations at such locations with velocities
up to 20 km s−1. The second reported region is a peculiar
piece of penumbra, displaying inward motion at the bound-
ary between the penumbra and umbra (Siu-Tapia et al. 2017).
These inward ﬂows are also known as counter-Evershed ﬂow
owing to the reversal of the direction compared to the clas-
sical Evershed ﬂow (Evershed 1909; Siu-Tapia et al. 2018).
Siu-Tapia et al. (2017) found an area of more than 5.1 arcsec2
with a ﬁeld strength larger than 7 kG, with maximum values
of ∼8.3 kG at the strong downﬂow regions bordering the um-
bra. However, these authors stated that their ﬁts to the com-
plex Stokes proﬁles were not as good as in other places of the
analyzed AR and therefore excluded them from their analy-

sis in 2017. In recent work, Siu-Tapia et al. (2019) studied
the likelihood of these complex Stokes proﬁles to be pro-
duced either by strong ﬁelds or by a multicomponent atmo-
sphere within the resolution element. These authors, based
on Bayesian analysis, concluded that the strong-ﬁeld sce-
nario is the most likely explanation for their observations.
It is worth noting that both strong ﬁelds in the inner and
outer parts of the sunspot were both associated with super-
fast downﬂows. In this paper, we present a third location in
which to ﬁnd strong magnetic ﬁelds: a bipolar light bridge.
However, the strong ﬁelds presented here diﬀer from previ-
ous ones in their association with slow downﬂow velocities.
Light bridges are elongated intrusions that appear in the
umbra of sunspots (e.g., Leka 1997). Lagg et al. (2014) stated
that light bridges can usually be divided into three categories
depending on their size and brightness: faint light bridges
(Lites et al. 1991), strong light bridges (Sobotka et al. 1993),
and granular light bridges (Vazquez 1973; Rouppe van der
Voort et al. 2010). These categories share the property of a
rather weak ﬁeld strength on the order of hundreds of gauss
or even lower in their deepest observable layers (e.g., Lagg
et al. 2014; Toriumi et al. 2015). However, there is another
type of light bridge, not mentioned in Lagg et al. (2014), one
separating umbrae of opposite polarities, i.e. light bridges in
delta-spots. The only possibility for such a bipolar conﬁg-
uration of sunspot umbrae to develop is the convergence of
two ARs. Such light bridges appear along the polarity inver-
sion line (PIL) and in some cases have been found to harbor
strong ﬁelds of the order of (cid:38)4 kG (e.g., Tanaka 1991; Zirin
& Wang 1993; Livingston et al. 2006; Jaeggli 2016; Okamoto
& Sakurai 2018; Wang et al. 2018).

In this paper, we have analyzed the same observations
as Okamoto & Sakurai (2018), but with more sophisticated
tools to extract more of the information encoded in the sun-
light. We interpret the observations by solving the radiative
transfer equations assuming a height-stratiﬁed atmosphere
and taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of
the telescope. This type of inversion builds on more realistic
assumptions than the simplistic, ME-type atmospheres, al-
lowing us to determine the magnetic properties of these light
bridges and in particular of the strong ﬁelds they harbor in
greater detail.

2. OBSERVATIONS

The main data set we use to infer the magnetic ﬁeld infor-
mation at the light bridge was recorded by Hinode/Spectro-
Polarimeter (SP). We also employ Hinode/BFI ﬁltergrams
and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data to follow
the evolution of the AR as it passed over the solar disk.

We studied 32 scans taken by Hinode/SP of AR 11967.
These scans were taken from 2014 February 1 to February
6. In this article we focus our analysis on the scan starting
at 19:00 UT on 2014 February 4, when the AR was located
at 16◦ W, 8◦ S. The selected scan is the same as analyzed
by Okamoto & Sakurai (2018) and is the one in which the
strongest magnetic ﬁeld is found. The spectropolarimetric
data were obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT;

Tsuneta et al. 2008), speciﬁcally with the SP (Ichimoto et al.
2008) on board the Hinode satellite (Kosugi et al. 2007). Hin-
ode/SP measures the full Stokes vector of the Fe I spectral
lines at 6301.5 Å and 6302.5 Å, with a spectral sampling of
21.5 mÅ. The plate scale along the slit is 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)32 pixel−1, and
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)29 pixel−1 along the scan direction (=fast scan mode). Fig-
ure 1 shows the continuum image and the maps of magnetic
ﬁeld strength, inclination, and line-of-sight velocity of AR
11967. The black boxes on the left side of each panel of Fig-
ure 1 mark the region of interest that harbored strong mag-
netic ﬁelds.

The data are calibrated using the standard reduction tools
(Lites & Ichimoto 2013). These routines account for spurious
continuum polarization (SCP). However, for those proﬁles
with extreme Zeeman splitting, the wing of the Fe I line is ex-
tremely broad and therefore aﬀects the result of the standard
calibration procedures. As a consequence, an oﬀset in Stokes
Q and U is detected. This eﬀect can be easily seen, for exam-
ple, in Figure 1 of Okamoto & Sakurai (2018), where the re-
gions with strong ﬁelds show clearly nonzero Stokes Q and U
intensities in the continuum, where the signal should be zero.
This spurious signal is on average ∼0.5% but can be as high
as 2% in the linear polarization. Since this eﬀect only occurs
in a few pixels, we correct it post facto by simply subtract-
ing this oﬀset. In the case of Okamoto & Sakurai (2018), the
SCP does not aﬀect their conclusions signiﬁcantly, as these
authors assumed an ME-type atmosphere. However, for a
height-dependent inversion, like the one used for this study,
the SCP strongly aﬀects the information retrieved at lower
heights (see next section), since this information is predomi-
nantly contained in the wings of the spectral lines.

We followed the temporal evolution of the AR 11967 us-
ing data from the HMI (Scherrer et al. 2012) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012). We
took continuum intensity images and magnetograms to track
the AR from a longitude of -45◦ to +45◦ every 30 minutes.
This interval ranges from January 31 at 02:00 UT to Febru-
ary 6 at 22:00 UT. In addition, we used a full 45 s cadence
lasting for 10 hr around the Hinode’s scan starting on Febru-
ary 4 at 17:00 UT. The continuum images are enhanced us-
ing the neuronal network Enhance (D´ıaz Baso & Asensio
Ramos 2018). In addition, we use Hinode/BFI observations
starting on February 4 at 00:00 UT and lasting for 26 hr. We
focus on the ﬁltergrams of the Ca II h at 3968.5 Å with 1-
minute cadence and the G-band ﬁltergrams around 3883.5 Å
with 10-minute cadence. Note that there are some gaps in
the data that depend on the observing mode. Three videos
are provided as online material. Snapshots of each video are
described in Figures 10-12 in Appendix B.

3. INVERSIONS

In an optical system, the PSF determines how an observed
point source is imaged on the detector plane. Inversely, the
PSF can also be used to calculate how much of the informa-
tion within a resolution element (pixel) actually comes from
the surroundings. For a diﬀraction-limited instrument, more
than 80% of the photons originating from a point source on

the solar surface are distributed to the neighboring pixels,
assuming a spatial sampling at the Nyquist frequency.
In
the current dataset, however, the data are undersampled by
a factor of almost two, limiting the expected contamination
of each pixel by the surroundings to less than 25%.

Solar magnetometry is based on measuring the degree of
polarization of sunlight to infer the magnetic ﬁeld properties
in the Sun. Light coming from two diﬀerent magnetic struc-
tures on the solar surface will have, in principle, two diﬀerent
degrees of polarization. After passing the optical system, the
measurements of light from these two objects are blurred ow-
ing to the PSF, thus mixing the observed degree of polariza-
tion from both objects. On top of that, if we take into account
the central obscuration of Hinode/SP that introduces a more
complex PSF into the system, then properly addressing the
PSF while analyzing spectropolarimetric data is clearly nec-
essary.

We carried out two types of stratiﬁed inversions using the
SPINOR code (Frutiger et al. 2000, which relies on the STO-
PRO routines (Solanki 1987) to do the polarized radiative
transfer): the traditional pixel-by-pixel (1D) approach, and
a spatially coupled scheme that takes into account the PSF
of the instrument (hereafter denoted as 2D inversion follow-

ing van Noort 2012). Three nodes were used, located at
log τ = −2.3, -0.8, and 0.0, where τ is the continuum opti-
cal depth at 5000 Å, for all relevant atmospheric parameters,
which serve as free parameters used to obtain a ﬁt to the data.
This choice spans the formation heights of the Fe I lines at
6300 Å, which lie, depending on the atmospheric parameter,
in the range of log τ = [+0.1, −2.7] assuming a standard VAL-
C model (Vernazza et al. 1981). The locations of the nodes
were optimized to obtain the global minimum for the entire
map of the ﬁts. This is important for the 2D inversions, since
the information from diﬀerent pixels is coupled. As a con-
sequence of this global approach, there might be locations
where the node placement is locally not optimal. In addition,
we performed tests by placing the nodes at diﬀerent optical
depths and repeating the inversions (see Table 4 in the ap-
pendix A). For example, we shifted the bottom node even
below the log τ = 0. We also tried setting two nodes for the
vLOS. However, all our experiments clearly maintained the
strong-ﬁeld character of the light bridge (see appendix A
for details). Therefore, the choice of node location does not
strongly aﬀect the reported results.

proﬁles, with the observations being represented by black crosses. The ﬁeld strengths given in the Stokes I panels refer to log τ = 0. The best

Figure 3. Maps of atmospheric parameters obtained with the 1D
inversions. Columns show, from left to right, temperature, magnetic
ﬁeld strength, and the inclination and velocity relative to the line
of sight. Each row denotes diﬀerent optical depths: log τ = −2.3
(top), log τ = −0.8 (middle), and log τ = 0 (bottom). The arrows
in the leftmost column point to the solar disk center. The color
bar of a column applies to all rows of that column. Overplotted
on the images are ﬁeld strength contour levels at 5.0 and 6.1 kG
at log τ = 0. The green line in the last column traces the PIL at
each optical depth. The azimuth at the light bridge is presented in
Figure 5.

The free parameters of the inversion are the temperature
(T ), magnetic ﬁeld strength (|(cid:126)B|), inclination (γ), azimuth (φ),
line-of-sight velocity (vLOS) and microturbulence (vmicro). It
is worth noting that both inversion schemes have the same
number of free parameters. A Gaussian kernel with an
FWHM of 24.3 mÅ is used to account for the spectral in-
strumental broadening. No further parameter is needed to
justify the broadening of the line, such as a macroturbulence.
We also veriﬁed that for the Fe I line pair at 6300 Å and a
ﬁeld strength of 6000 G, i.e. close to the maximum value re-
ported by Wang et al. (2018), we are still far away from the
Paschen-Back regime, which was ignored in our analysis.

Examples of the ﬁts to the observed Stokes proﬁles within
the light bridge are shown in Figure 2. Black crosses indi-
cate the observed data, while the best-ﬁt proﬁles resulting
from the 1D classical inversion scheme and the 2D inver-
sion are represented by the red and green lines, respectively.

(cid:38) χ2

Vertical gray lines show the Zeeman splitting by a magnetic
ﬁeld |(cid:126)B|, given by ∆λ|(cid:126)B|
= 4.67 × 10−13geﬀλ0|(cid:126)B|, where geﬀ
is the eﬀective Land´e factor of the transition with a wave-
length λ0. We used the magnetic ﬁeld retrieved by the 2D at
log τ = −0.8. For all the plotted proﬁles, the ﬁt by the 2D in-
version scheme is better both visually and quantitatively (in
the sense that χ2
2D). Figure 2 corroborates how well
1D
the 2D inversions ﬁt the observed Stokes proﬁles, even in ex-
tremely complex cases, such as those in panels (c), (e), (f),
and (h). Only in panel (d) is the ﬁt less perfect, as evinced
by the fact that the reduced χ2 for both inversion schemes
is signiﬁcantly larger than unity. As we shall discuss later,
the possibility of the existence of a second atmospheric com-
ponent within the resolution element can be excluded (Sec-
tion 5.1). For all other proﬁles, the complexity can be fully
explained by the light contributed to that pixel by neighbor-
ing pixels, which often have quite diﬀerent proﬁle shapes,
so that the observed proﬁle looks quite complex, although
the atmospheric structure in that particular pixel may be rel-
atively simple. Thus, these very complex proﬁles can be re-
produced by simple one-component models if the stray light
from the other pixels is properly taken into account.

Magneto-optical eﬀects can be excluded as a source of the
complex proﬁles observed near the PIL. These eﬀects con-
tribute negatively to the polarization degree in the absorption
matrix, resulting in a reversal at wavelengths where the core

4. RESULTS

4.1. Atmospheric conditions at the light bridge

Following the inversion schemes described in section 3,
the atmospheric maps obtained by 1D and 2D inversions are
presented in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. Columns give
temperature, magnetic ﬁeld strength, inclination, and line-
of-sight velocity at the three optical depth nodes. The optical
depth for each row is indicated in the ﬁeld strength column.
The levels of the ﬁeld strength contours are 5 and 6.1 kG, (the
latter corresponds to the largest ﬁeld reported by Livingston
et al. 2006). Clear evidence of the smearing by the PSF
can be seen in the size of the area covered by the magnetic
ﬁeld. In the 1D inversion the atmospheric maps appear more
blurred, with the contours for the ﬁeld >5 kG being roundish
and extending far outside the light bridge. In contrast, the 2D
inversion conﬁnes the strong ﬁelds on the light bridge, and
the 5 kG contour nicely follows the light bridge shape.

The PIL passes through the light bridge and separates not
only the magnetic polarities but also, in the southern part of
the light bridge, the negative and positive Doppler velocities
(green lines on the fourth column in Figures 3 and 4). An area
of 32.7 arcsec2 harbors ﬁelds larger than 5 kG. The strong
ﬁelds occur in the bright region such as a light bridge, and
not in the dark umbra. Table 1 lists the number of pixels for
both inversions with ﬁelds larger than the thresholds from 5
to 7.5 kG at log τ = 0 and log τ = −0.8 in parentheses.

at log τ = 0 and, in parenthesis, at log τ = −0.8. The pixel size is
0.29(cid:48)(cid:48)×0.32(cid:48)(cid:48).

Both 1D and 2D inversions show two regions with ﬁelds
stronger than 6.5 kG mainly at log τ = 0.0 and log τ = −0.8,
but in a few pixels also at log τ = −2.3. These two regions are
associated with downﬂows observed at all three nodes. The
velocity is higher in deeper layers, and the mean velocity is
around 5 km s−1 at log τ = 0, which is in the subsonic regime.
Inside these regions, the strongest magnetic ﬁelds at log τ = 0
are ∼7.3 kG (1D) and ∼8.2 kG (2D), while at log τ = −0.8
the largest ﬁeld strengths are 6.6 kG for both inversions. For
the 2D inversions, 287 pixels harbor ﬁelds larger than 5 kG at
log τ = −0.8 and in ﬁve of them exceeding 6.5 kG. It is worth

noticing that the large Zeeman splitting can directly be seen
in the Stokes I proﬁles (see vertical lines in Figure 2 marking
the Zeeman splitting at the magnetic ﬁeld strength retrieved
by the 2D inversions at log τ = −0.8).

Table 2 lists the average atmospheric values for both 1D
and 2D inversions. The values come from the 32 pixels with
|(cid:126)B| > 6.5 kG at log τ = 0 in the 2D inversion. The param-
eters obtained for the pixel with the strongest ﬁeld strength
in the 2D inversion are given in parentheses. As the strong
ﬁelds are located on both sides of the PIL, we remove the
polarity information before averaging the inclination angle.
Therefore, in Table 2, we list the inclination ranging between
0◦ ≤ γ(cid:48) ≤ 90◦, i.e., how inclined the ﬁeld is with respect to
the surface of the Sun, irrespective of its polarity. γ(cid:48) = 90◦
corresponds to horizontal magnetic ﬁelds (i.e., parallel to the
solar surface), and the smaller γ(cid:48) is, the more vertical are the
ﬁelds.

Table 2 shows that the temperature in the light bridge,
where the strongest ﬁelds are located, is similar to the tem-
perature observed in regular penumbral ﬁlaments (Column
(3)), which is an indication that magneto-convection is strong
enough to allow hot material coming from subsurface layers
to ﬁll the light bridge. The mean ﬁeld strength at these loca-
tions is 6.9 kG at the bottom of the photosphere and 5.1 kG at
log τ = −2.3 (Column (4)). In addition, the ﬁeld is highly in-
clined, being somewhat more vertical in deeper layers (Col-
umn (5)). This conﬁguration resembles a low-lying loop-like
geometry.

Another characteristic of the strongest ﬁelds is that they
are usually associated with subsonic line-of-sight velocities
(Column (6)). This is in contrast to the strong-ﬁeld observa-
tions at the endpoints of penumbral ﬁlaments reported by van
Noort et al. (2013) and Siu-Tapia et al. (2017, 2019), which
are associated with strong, supersonic downﬂows.

The azimuth modulo 180◦ inside the region of interest at
log τ = 0 is presented in Figure 5 (panel (a)). The mean an-
gle of the ﬁeld with respect to the PIL is ζ ∼46◦, exceed-
ing ζ ∼60◦ at the locations of the strong ﬁelds (panel (c)).
The ﬁlaments visible in the intensity image are inclined at
a similar angle with respect to the PIL, suggesting that the
magnetic ﬁeld in the light bridge is oriented along the ﬁl-
ament direction (see Figure 5 and the animation associated
with Figure 11).

Since the strongest ﬁelds are returned by the 2D inversion,
it is important to test how results of the 2D inversions com-
pare with those of the generally used 1D inversions. To com-
pare the 1D with the 2D inversion, Figure 6 shows the scatter
plots of the ﬁeld strength, inclination, line-of-sight velocity,
and χ2 obtained from these two types of inversions. These
scatter plots are based on the points on the light bridge with
a continuum intensity Ic > 0.3. Choosing a diﬀerent thresh-
old does not alter the scatter plots since the boundary be-
tween the umbra and the light bridge in continuum intensity
is rather sharp (see Figure 5(d)). The scatter plots highlight
the following points: (i) The results from the two types of
inversions agree rather well with each other. The two in-
version methods do not show a systematic diﬀerence for the

presented atmospheric parameters. The green lines in panels
(a)-(c) show the linear ﬁts between the results from the two
inversion schemes, with correlation coeﬃcients larger than
0.94 for the ﬁeld strength and inclination and below 3% dis-
crepancy between the linear ﬁt and the 1:1 relationship. The
correlation for vLOS is only slightly worse (χ2=0.94) with an
11% slope discrepancy. (ii) In 55% of the pixels inside the
light bridge, the 1D inversion recovered larger values of |(cid:126)B|
at log τ = 0. (iii) The ﬁt to the Stokes proﬁles using 2D in-
versions is by far superior compared to the 1D inversions.
99.96% of the pixels in the χ2 scatter plot (Figure 6(d)) lie
below the 1:1 line.

There are 11 pixels with line-of-sight downﬂow veloci-
ties larger than 6 km s−1 in the 2D inversion (see Figure 6c).
These pixels are located on the boundary between the um-
bra regions and the light bridge. The median ﬁeld strength
obtained from the 2D inversions, where the fastest ﬂows are
located, is 5.5 kG, with a standard deviation of 2.6 kG, and
a maximum of |(cid:126)B| = 7.0 kG at log τ = −0.8. The corre-
sponding Stokes proﬁles are highly complex, and the two
inversion schemes return diﬀerent ﬁts. While the 2D inver-
sion better accounts for such complex proﬁles by adjusting
the ﬁeld strength, the 1D inversions ascribe a higher vLOS to
these lines and provide a worse ﬁt to the observations (e.g.,
Figure 13, row (d)).

5. DISCUSSION

The results presented in this paper conﬁrm the presence
of very strong magnetic ﬁelds in a bipolar light bridge.
Okamoto & Sakurai (2018) reported ﬁelds of 6.2 kG for
the same region. However, the ME approach struggles in
ﬁtting the often highly complex observed Stokes proﬁles
(see Figure 1 of Okamoto & Sakurai (2018)) because it
cannot handle height gradients that produce the asymme-
tries clearly visible in the observed proﬁles (Figures 3 and
4). The height-dependent inversions return considerably
stronger ﬁelds. While the 1D inversions show these strong
ﬁelds distributed over a larger area, even extending into the
umbra adjacent to the light bridge, the 2D inversions con-
centrate the strong ﬁelds on the light bridge and in smaller

regions with a maximum strength of 8.2 kG, while providing
better ﬁts to the Stokes proﬁles. All along the light bridge, the
magnetic ﬁeld is stronger than 5 kG for both 1D and 2D in-
versions. The ﬁelds are mostly horizontal (i.e. parallel to the
solar surface), and their azimuth suggests that they connect
the two umbrae, with an average angle of ∼46◦ measured
with respect to the normal to the PIL (see Figure 5). The
strongest ﬁelds within the bright structure are associated with
downﬂows (as already noticed by Okamoto & Sakurai 2018)
and have temperatures that are commonly found in penum-
bral ﬁlaments.

5.1. Need for multicomponent atmospheres?

The complexity of the Stokes proﬁles might be an in-
dication of the presence of a second atmospheric compo-
nent. However, our inversion results show that the observed
Stokes proﬁles can also be reproduced with a simple, one-
component atmospheric setup that allows depth-dependent
atmospheric parameters. This setup works particularly well
when combined with 2D inversions, which make use of the
prior knowledge about the PSF of the optical system (see
Figure 2). For comparison, we made experiments with two-
component atmospheres for both the 1D and 2D inversion
schemes (see Figures 7 and 8). We tested two simple atmo-
spheric models with a second component to ﬁt the observa-
tions. In both models, the new atmospheric component adds
extra free parameters to those described in Section 3. The
models are as follows:

• Model 1: Reference model (RM; Section 3). One-
component atmosphere with three nodes with 16 de-
grees of freedom (dof) per pixel.

• Model 2: RM + a second component with height-
independent parameters except for the temperature.
The dof are 16 for the ﬁrst component, 9 for the sec-
ond component (3 for T , and 1 each for |(cid:126)B|, γ, φ, vLOS,
vmicro, and the ﬁlling factor α). vmicro was coupled be-
tween the two components (dof per pixel: 24).

• Model 3: Two height-stratiﬁed components, each with
three nodes for all atmospheric parameters. The dof

velocity and ﬁeld strength. We also measured the velocity of
the possible second component (v(cid:48)
red ≈ 18 km s−1), and we
used it as the initial condition of the more rapidly downﬂow-
ing component. We also tried bounding the second compo-
nent to values ±5 km s−1 around the v(cid:48)
red value. In other ex-
periments, we varied the initial values for both components
of ﬁeld strength and velocity. We also tried to initialize the
inversion with a second component of opposite polarity, or to
impose the ﬁlling factor for the second component. None of
our tests produced results that deviated signiﬁcantly from the
values of the strong ﬁelds that we report below.

Figures 7 and 8 show examples from 5 pixels with strong
ﬁelds and with a possible second component. The green, red,
and blue lines show the best ﬁt using models 1 to 3, respec-
tively. The corresponding values for the reduced χ2, |(cid:126)B|, γ,
vLOS and the ﬁlling factor α for the three models are listed
in Table 6 in Appendix E. Our experiments provide clear ev-
idence for the existence of strong ﬁelds irrespective of the
model: the observations are well ﬁtted, and the large ﬁelds

|(cid:126)B|, γ, φ, and vLOS vary along the line of sight, each
contributing with three free parameters, as well as the
ﬁlling factor α). vmicro was coupled between the two
components (dof per pixel: 32).

Fitting a second component (Model 3) to the complex pro-
ﬁles in the light bridge requires a careful selection of the ini-
tial conditions for the inversion to ensure convergence to the
global minimum, especially when one of the components is

(>6 kG) appeared in both 1D and 2D inversions, even when
applying a two-component atmosphere model.

In addition, our experiments did not ﬁnd that a second
component signiﬁcantly increased the quality of the ﬁt to the
observed Stokes proﬁles. The ﬁlling factors for the second
component are usually small ((cid:46)20%), while the reduced χ2
does not improve with increasing number of free parameters,
in particular for the 2D inversion. There is some improve-
ment for the 1D inversions, which is expected (see below).

The need for a second component within the resolution el-
ement is obviously only necessary to account for the photons
originating from the strong-ﬁeld regions in the light bridge
that are distributed over a larger area by the telescope PSF
or to mimic the eﬀects of vertical gradients in the atmo-
sphere. Figures 3 and 4 show the existence of such gradi-
ents, which cannot be reproduced by the height-independent
ME-type atmospheres (such as the inversion scheme applied
by Okamoto & Sakurai 2018). For these reasons, we can
safely state that a second atmospheric component within the
resolution element is not required to reproduce the complex
observed Stokes proﬁles.

5.2. Temporal evolution of the light bridge

The AR 11967 appeared on the east limb on 2014 January
28. On the 29th, two opposite-polarity umbrae merged and

formed a large, complex sunspot. The two opposite-polarity
umbrae coexisted over the whole time while transiting the
solar disk. The region between the two umbrae was occu-
pied by the light bridge harboring the strong ﬁelds. This
light bridge remained there with varying thickness and in-
tensity over the whole time the AR crossed the solar disk.
The negative-polarity (γ < 0) umbra adjacent and east of the
light bridge in Figure 1 moved in a northwesterly direction,
while the umbra adjacent and west of the light bridge moved
in a southeasterly direction. The light bridge appears exactly
at the PIL between both opposite-polarity umbrae (see Fig-
ure 10). As a consequence, this light bridge is not of the
classical type that usually appears in a decaying umbra with
a single polarity.

To understand the existence of the strong ﬁelds in the light
bridge, measured around 19:00 UT on 2014 February 4, we
study its temporal evolution. There were two ﬂares before
the observation of the strong ﬁelds at 16:02 UT and 18:49 UT
and another at 19:41 UT after the observations ended (see
Table 3). SDO/AIA images suggest that these ﬂares were
associated with the light bridge. The photospheric images
taken by HMI and Hinode/BFI reveal the formation of a very
long ﬁlament connecting the light bridge on one end to a pore
moving away from the spot on the east side of the AR (see
Figure 12). This long ﬁlament breaks down around 16:00 UT,

the time of the maximum of Flare 1. The breakdown seems to
be connected with brightenings in the Ca II images. Then, for
about an hour, the light bridge separating the two opposite-
polarity umbrae almost vanished. After this, a new light
bridge formed at the PIL with a ﬁlamentary structure inclined
by ∼46◦ with respect to the PIL. The light bridge broadened
until it reached a width of 3 Mm at 19:11 UT. Flare 2 is ob-
served between 18:36 and 18:54 UT before the Hinode/SP
observations at the light bridge that took place between 19:10
and 19:12 UT. Finally, 15 minutes later, GOES reported the
start of a C5.4 class ﬂare at 19:27 UT. Another possibility for
the appearance of the light bridge would be that the two um-
brae move away from each other. However, with this process
it would be more diﬃcult to explain the strong ﬁelds on the
light bridge. Further information about all ﬂares produced by
the AR 11967 is summarized in Table 5.

It is unclear whether the disappearance of the light bridge
is caused by Flare 1. It should be noted that the maximum
ﬁeld strength in this light bridge might have been reached
between the two Hinode/SP scans at 15:42 UT and 19:00 UT,
but there are no Hinode/SP observations available to prove it.

5.3. Possible mechanisms to amplify the magnetic ﬁeld

The main aim of this paper is the reliable determination
of the strong magnetic ﬁelds in the light bridge. Nonethe-
less, in this section we brieﬂy sketch some possible mecha-
nisms for the ampliﬁcation of the magnetic ﬁeld to such high
values. More insight into the mechanisms can be gained by
performing a statistical study of diﬀerent ARs with a similar,
opposite-polarity conﬁguration of umbrae. We already iden-

LOOKING DEEPER IN THE ATMOSPHERE

The strong ﬁelds are located in a light bridge and not in
the umbra. The temperature inside the structure is similar
to penumbral ﬁlaments; therefore, the opacity is expected to
be higher than in the umbra owing to the higher tempera-
ture (for a ﬁxed ﬁeld strength). The very strong ﬁelds, how-
ever, imply a strong evacuation of the gas due to horizon-
tal force balance, which in turn lowers the opacity, so that
where the strong ﬁelds are measured we are seeing deeper
layers in which ﬁelds are typically stronger. Downﬂows also
may enhance the evacuation, although for subsonic down-
ﬂows the eﬀect will likely be limited. It is worth mention-
ing that assuming that the ﬂows inside the light bridge are
ﬁeld aligned (vf-a = vLOS/ cos γ), the velocities in some pix-
els reach values close to or even somewhat above the sound

the 8.2 kG pixel, the ﬁeld-aligned velocity reaches its maxi-
mum of ∼8.9 km s−1 at log τ = −0.9. However, in most of the
pixels with strong ﬁelds the ﬁeld-aligned velocities are sub-
sonic at all heights. In particular, the ﬁeld-aligned velocities
are far from the 22 km s−1 previously reported for strong-ﬁeld
regions at the outer boundary of the penumbra of a sunspot
(van Noort et al. 2013), or at the tails of counter-Evershed
ﬂows (Siu-Tapia et al. 2017). Consequently, the evacuation
and reduced opacity helps to explain the very strong ﬁelds
but is on its own not suﬃcient.

Downﬂows have been proposed to enhance magnetic ﬁeld
strengths by the convective collapse instability (Parker 1978;
Spruit 1979; Grossmann-Doerth et al. 1998). The >7 kG
strong ﬁelds reported by van Noort et al. (2013) have large
downﬂow velocities of up to 22 km s−1 associated with them
(see Esteban Pozuelo et al. 2016). Siu-Tapia et al. (2019) re-
ported strong ﬁelds in a region occupied by counter-Evershed
ﬂows. Those strong ﬁelds were also associated with fast
downﬂow velocities, where the umbra acts as a magnetic bar-
rier, compressing the channels along which the downﬂows
occur. The large downﬂow velocities observed in both stud-
ies are also observed in MHD simulations, which means that
such solutions can be explained using the assumptions un-
derlying the simulations. Despite many similarities to these
works, our situation is diﬀerent in one aspect: we observed
that 85% of the strong ﬁelds exceeding 6.5 kG are associated
with subsonic downﬂows, with velocities of 5 km s−1 on av-
erage and 3 km s−1 for the strongest ﬁeld. Nevertheless, the
process of amplifying the ﬁeld could be the same: magne-
tized plasma hits a barrier (i.e., the umbra), where it is forced
to ﬂow down at the endpoints of these ﬁlaments associated
with strong and more vertical magnetic ﬁelds at deeper lay-
ers.

Okamoto & Sakurai (2018) suggested that the magnetic
ﬁeld lines at the light bridge are subducted by the Evershed
ﬂow. The strongest ﬁelds, however, appear in the ﬁlaments
carrying a ﬂow toward the umbra, opposite to the normal Ev-
ershed ﬂow direction (as pointed out by the referee; see foot-
note 6 in Okamoto & Sakurai 2018). However, in the present
conﬁguration of a penumbra existing between two umbrae
it is not even clear what the normal Evershed ﬂow direction
should be. Nevertheless, it can be stated that the strong mag-
netic ﬁeld strength within the bipolar light bridge of the AR
11967 is associated with downﬂows, avoiding the association
with Evershed ﬂows.

MAGNETIC FLUX EMERGENCE

The bipolar light bridge harboring strong ﬁelds can also
be an example of an emerging photospheric ﬂux rope sim-
ilar to the one reported by Guglielmino et al. (2017, 2019)
and Bharti et al. (2017). A ﬂux rope is inherently associ-
ated with strong ﬁelds buoyantly rising from subsurface lay-
ers. From the temporal evolution observed by HMI and Hin-

ode/BFI, the light bridge seems to be twisted (see the online
animations) and increases in width with time. In addition, the
negative-positive Doppler velocity pattern obtained from the
inversions tends to agree with this picture (Lites et al. 2010).
The special conﬁguration of two adjacent opposite-polarity
umbrae oﬀers an alternative ﬂux emergence scenario:
the
previously ﬁeld-free gas, trapped between the two opposite-
polarity umbrae in subsurface layers, advects the magnetic
ﬁeld of the adjacent ﬂux tubes connected to the two umbrae.
This advection occurs during the motion within the elongated
convection cell forming the ﬁlamentary channels observed on
the light bridge.

SHEAR-INDUCED FIELD AMPLIFICATION

The light bridge consists of ﬁlaments with a tilt angle of
40◦ to 60◦ with respect to the PIL. This tilt could be the result
of a shear, caused by the motion of the two umbrae relative to
each other, which would have ampliﬁed the ﬁeld through in-
duction (see e.g., Toriumi & Hotta 2019; Anﬁnogentov et al.
2019).

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

The thermodynamic and magnetic ﬁeld properties of the
observed light bridge separating two umbrae of opposite po-
larity can be summarized as follows:

• We ﬁnd ﬁelds larger than 5 kG at all three optical depth
node points used during the inversions. The area cov-
ered by ﬁelds >5 kG is 32.7 arcsec2 at log τ = 0, and
26.6 arcsec2 at log τ = −0.8. Fields larger than 6.5 kG
are observed in 32 pixels distributed over two contigu-
ous regions. In nine of these pixels the ﬁeld strength
exceeds 7 kG. We report evidence of a record-high
ﬁeld strength of 8.2 kG at τ = 1 in one pixel.

• Coupled 2D inversions (van Noort 2012) provide bet-
ter ﬁts than 1D inversions but give on average similar
|(cid:126)B| values. However, for the strongest ﬁelds, 2D inver-
sions give larger ﬁeld strength.

• The best ﬁt to the observed Stokes proﬁles does not
require a second atmospheric component. However,
in all tested inversion setups (height-dependent one-
component and two-component atmospheres of diﬀer-
ent complexity), the strong magnetic ﬁelds are repro-
duced.

• The ﬁelds are mainly horizontal (see Figures 3and 4),
and the ﬁelds are observed to be more vertical at deeper
layers, independent of their polarity (see Table 2).

• The angle of the magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the PIL
is on average ∼46◦. At the places with the strongest
magnetic ﬁelds, this angle is ∼60◦ (see Figure 5).

• The vLOS is higher in deeper layers. The positive and
negative Doppler velocities are approximately sym-
metric and separated by the PIL. The strongest ﬁelds

12

are associated with downﬂows. A total of 32 pixels
with ﬁelds larger than 6.5 kG have subsonic line-of-
sight velocities.

• The temperature stratiﬁcation inside the light bridge is
similar to the temperature stratiﬁcation inside penum-
bral ﬁlaments. This indicates that the ﬁlaments in the
light bridge have a similar origin to penumbral ﬁla-
ments, where magneto-convection is supplying the ﬁl-
aments with hot material from deeper layers.

The sum of our observational ﬁndings suggests that the
light bridge is composed of a twisting and likely emerging
ﬂux rope, still largely buried under the surface at the time of
the analyzed observations. However, this and other poten-
tial interpretations will be tested on a larger data set in an
upcoming publication.

The largest ﬁeld observed in this analyzed light bridge has
a magnitude of 8.2 kG (=0.82 tesla). A systematic study of
similar conﬁgurations of ARs, where a light bridge separates
two umbrae of opposite polarities, could provide insight into
how common such extremely strong magnetic ﬁelds are and
if even stronger ﬁelds exist on the Sun. An important step
toward the discovery of even stronger ﬁelds would be high
spatial resolution observations of such a light bridge using
the infrared Fe lines located at 1.56 µm, sampling the deep-

est observable layers of the photosphere (e.g., Solanki et al.
1992; Mili´c et al. 2019).

APPENDIX

A. NODE POSITION
The choice of the location of the nodes can aﬀect the ﬁts of
the proﬁles, the results, and even in some cases the interpreta-
tion. Only results that are robust against the exact placement
of the nodes can be considered to be reliable. For the values
reported in this work, the locations of the nodes were opti-
mized to obtain the global minimum for the entire map. To
test the reliability of the reported strong ﬁelds, we performed
a set of experiments by placing one of the nodes at a dif-
ferent optical depth using the 2D inversion scheme. Table 4
presents the ﬁeld strength retrieved at log τ = (0, −0.8, −2.3),
the reduced χ2, and the mean reduced χ2 over the area inﬂu-
enced by the PSF. For the sake of the example, we chose the
same pixel reported harboring 8.2 kG magnetic ﬁeld strength
(Table 4(a)).

In test (b), we placed the bottom node below log τ = 0 at
the locations of log τ = (+0.05, +0.1, +0.5). As it can be seen
from Table 4, the results do not depend strongly on the loca-
tion of the bottom node. The standard deviation of the ﬁeld
strength between these experiments is 70, 160 and 300 G for
the bottom, middle, and top nodes, respectively. In the case
of the middle, and top nodes, we selected two places above
and below the node position used in the paper (Table 4, tests
(b)/(c)). The magnetic ﬁeld strength in these cases still shows
the mean value of 7.89 ± 0.28 kG at log τ = 0.

Additionally, we performed inversions with two nodes in
the velocity. Figure 9 shows the comparison between the
three-node (top) and two-node (bottom) inversions. For the
case of the 8.2 kG pixel, the reduced χ2 is smaller compared
to the χ2 = 3.6 when having three nodes. However, for other
pixels within the light bridge, the magnetic ﬁeld and the re-
duced χ2 values are larger (see Figures 9 (d)-(f)). The mean
χ2 value increases from 1.7 to 1.9, with a larger standard
deviation changing from 1.4 to 1.6. For the strongest ﬁeld
pixel, the magnetic ﬁeld decreased by 3.5% at log τ = 0. On
the other hand, the mean ﬁeld strength over the entire light
bridge increased by 12.5% (see left panels in Figure 9). This
increment in the magnetic ﬁeld can be easily explained: to ﬁt
the asymmetries in the wings of the spectral line, the code as-
signs larger magnetic ﬁeld strength to compensate the miss-
ing information carried by the line-of-sight velocity.

The mean values of the magnetic ﬁeld between all the ex-
periments are |(cid:126)B|(log τ = 0) = (8.09 ± 0.23) kG, |(cid:126)B|(log τ =
−0.8) = (6.77 ± 0.26) kG, and |(cid:126)B|(log τ = −2.3) = (6.23 ±
0.32) kG. This clearly supports the strong-ﬁeld character of
the light bridge. Therefore, the location of the bottom node
seems to not aﬀect strongly the reported results.

C. SOME NOTEWORTHY STOKES PROFILES INSIDE

THE REGION OF INTEREST
Examples of special regions at/next to the light bridge are
presented in Figure 13. Rows (b), (d), (f), and (g) show
the outliers pointed out in Figure 6, where the |(cid:126)B| from 1D
and 2D inversions presented diﬀerences larger than 1 kG at
log τ = 0, or at log τ = −0.8 (row (f)), or diﬀerence in vLOS
(row (d)). Rows (c) and (d) show proﬁles that result in very
strong magnetic ﬁelds associated with superfast velocities
(cid:38)6.9 km s−1 (the sound speed in the penumbra ranges from
∼6 to ∼8 km s−1).

For completeness in rows (a) and (e), we display com-
mon dark umbra proﬁles that are clearly contaminated with
molecular lines, excluded in our analysis. Proﬁles from rows
(b), (f), and (g) show similar contamination eﬀects, although
not as strong as in row (e), since the temperature in those
regions is still high enough to prevent molecules from fully
dominating these proﬁles.

at 00:39 UT. While the Ca II images run continuously, the G-band
images are updated every 10 minutes. The video ends the next day
at 02:00 UT in the top panel and 5 minutes before in the bottom one.
The duration of the video is 67 seconds.

D. FLARE PRODUCTION OF THE AR 11967

It is worth noting that such a large AR, harboring ﬁelds
>5 kG, produced only small ﬂares. We checked GOES 1-8 Å
for those days when the region crossed the solar disk. Table
5 summarizes the total number of C- and M-class ﬂares per
day that were hosted by the AR 11967 from 2014 January
26 to February 9. Row (4) marks the largest ﬂare of the day.
The largest ﬂare was an M6-class ﬂare that occurred 5 days
before the 8 kG ﬁelds were observed (see Table 5). The low
activity of AR 11967 contrasts with that of AR12673 pre-
sented by Wang et al. (2018). The AR 12673 presented sim-
ilarly strong ﬁelds (see, e.g., Anﬁnogentov et al. 2019), but
produced multiple X-class ﬂares (e.g., Verma 2018; Romano
et al. 2019) and a coronal mass ejection (Veronig et al. 2018),
including the largest ﬂare of the 24th solar cycle (e.g., Hou
et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2018). We conﬁrmed the existence
of the strong ﬁelds by applying both 1D and 2D inversions
to the Hinode/SP data of AR 12673, but this discussion goes
beyond the scope of the present paper (see also review by
Toriumi & Wang 2019).
