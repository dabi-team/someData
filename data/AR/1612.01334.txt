Pion spectra in Ar+Sc interactions at SPS energies∗

Maciej Lewicki for the NA61/SHINE Collaboration

Faculty of Physics and Astronomy, University of Wrocław, pl. Uniwersytecki 1,
50-137 Wrocław, Poland

This contribution discusses recent results from analysis of Ar+Sc in-
teractions recorded with the NA61/SHINE detector at six beam momenta:
13A, 19A, 30A, 40A, 75A, 150A GeV/c at the CERN SPS. Rapidity and
transverse mass spectra of pions obtained with the ”h-” analysis method
are presented and compared to results from p+p, Be+Be and Pb+Pb col-
lisions.

1. Introduction

NA61/SHINE is a ﬁxed target spectrometer located in CERN’s North
Area utilizing the SPS proton, ion and hadron beams [1]. Tracking capabil-
ities are provided by four large volume Time Projection Chambers (TPC),
two of which are located in the magnetic ﬁeld. The Projectile Spectator
Detector (PSD) – a zero degree, modular calorimeter, is used to determine
centrality of the collisions.

The aim of the experiment is to explore the QCD phase diagram (µB, T )
by a two-dimensional scan in collision energy and system size. The yields of
hadrons produced in the collisions are studied for indications of the onset of
deconﬁnement (kink, horn and step) and the critical point of the phase tran-
sition (hill in event-by-event ﬂuctuations). Recent measurements of Argon
and Scandium collisions are an important step in this program. Compari-
son of negative pion spectra give important insight into the dynamics of ion
collisions at the border of light and heavy nuclei.

2. h− Method

Negatively charged pion spectra were measured using the so called ”h−
method”. It exploits the fact that ≈ 90% of negative hadrons produced
in the SPS energy range are π− mesons. The small (≈ 10%) contribution
of other particles (K−, ¯p) was subtracted from negative pion spectra using
simulations with the EPOS-1.99 model [2]. The latter was tested on proton-
proton data and showed only small discrepancies in the ratio K−/π− (K−
are the main contribution to the correction)[3].

3. Data analysis

The events recorded by the NA61/SHINE spectrometer were selected
for data quality and centrality of the collisions. Centrality classes were de-
termined using the PSD, located most downstream on the beam line It
measures predominantly the projectile spectator forward energy EF of the
non-interacting nucleons of the beam nucleus. The distibution of EF was
used to deﬁne and select event classes corresponding to the collision cen-
trality.

Corrections of the raw data was based on EPOS-1.99 [2] (version CRMC
1.5.3.) model simulation of hadron interactions and the GEANT-3.2 code
for particle transport and detector simulation (see [4]). Centrality classes
in the model calculations were selected by the number of forward spectator
nucleons.

Results presented in the plots are shown only with statistical uncerain-
ties. These come from two sources: the experimental data and the simulation
based corrections. The contribution of the latter is insigniﬁcant (< 0.1%).
Based on the previous analysis of Be+Be[5] and p+p[4] reactions, we esti-
mate systematic errors at a level of 5%-10%.

4. Rapidity and Transverse Momentum Spectra

Results, corrected for acceptance and background, were obtained for the
5% most central Ar+Sc interactions at beam energies of 19A, 30A, 40A,
75A and 150A GeV/c. These are compared to measurements from inelastic
p+p [4] and the 5% most central Be+Be collisions [5] from NA61/SHINE
as well as from central (5 %or 7%) Pb+Pb collisions from NA49 [6, 7].
Preliminary results on double diﬀerential negatively charged pion spec-
tra are presented in Fig.1 for beam energies of 19A, 40A, and 150A GeV/c.
They cover the full forward rapidity hemisphere.
In order to obtain ra-
pidity distributions dn
dy , the data was extrapolated beyond the detector accp-
tance. The extrapolation in the direction of pT from the acceptance edge to
the pT = 3.0 GeV/c was performed with an exponential dependence ﬁtted

Resulting rapidity spectra (see Fig. 2) are asymmetric with respect to
mid-rapidity. Thus they were ﬁtted with two Gaussian functions, placed
symmetrically around mid-rapidity, with diﬀerent amplitudes:

Two opposiing eﬀects inﬂuence the asymmetry of the spectra: the asym-
metry of the system (40Ar projectile on 45Sc target) and the centrality se-
lection based on projectile spectators. The eﬀect of the projectile-spectator
asymmetry (Arel > 1) is overcome by the larger eﬀect introduced by central-
ity selection (Arel < 1) (see Fig. 3 left). The width σ of the rapidity distri-
butions shows monotonic behavior with increasing energy (see Fig 3 right).
However, non-monotonic behavior is observed for the dependence of σ

on the system size (Fig. 3 right):

Results for p+p collisions, however, are not yet corrected for isospin eﬀects.
In order to investigate the system size dependence of the shape of the
π− rapidity spectra dn
dy the results from central nucleus-nucleus interactions
are divided by those from inelastic p+p interactions. The spectra were nor-
malized to the same integral in y ∈ (0.0, 0.5) before division.

dy spectra of π− produced in central nucleus-nucleus collisions

From the results plotted in Fig 4 one observes that the spectrum shape
of π− produced in Ar+Sc interactions is almost identical to the one from
Pb+Pb, while data for Be+Be drift away signiﬁcantly.

5. Transverse mass distribution

Transverse mass spectra of π− for Ar+Sc interactions, shown in Fig.5,
show deviations from the exponential behaviour seen in p+p collisons. These

Another observation on transverse mass spectra is that the deviation
from the p+p data at high mT is larger for heavier nuclei, while there is no
observable dependence on collision energy (see Fig. 6).
