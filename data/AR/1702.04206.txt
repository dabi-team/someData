The category of ﬁnite dimensional representations over Q is denoted by rep(Q). The path
category k(Q) has Q0 as set of objects and Homk(Q)(x, y) is the vector space with basis given
by the paths from x to y. The trivial arrow in x is denoted by (cid:15)x. Since Q is locally bounded,
the category k(Q) is locally bounded in the sense of [7, 2.1]. A ﬁnite-dimensional module over
a locally bounded category A is a functor F : A
x∈A dimk F (x) is ﬁnite.
The category mod A has Auslander-Reiten sequences (see [7, 2.2]). Since a ﬁnite dimensional
module over k(Q) is the same as a representation of Q, the category rep(Q) has Auslander-
Reiten sequences.
If moreover Q0 is a ﬁnite set, we denote with kQ the path algebra of Q with idempotents
Q0. In this case kQ is a ﬁnite dimensional, associative, basic and connected k-algebra.

mod kQ
We denote by mod kQ the class of ﬁnite-dimensional kQ left modules. Given M
we let Mx := exM . The categories mod kQ and rep(Q) are equivalent (see for example [1, III
1.6]). We will therefore switch freely between representations of Q and modules of kQ, if one
of the approaches seems more convenient for us. We assume that the reader is familiar with
Auslander-Reiten theory and basic results on wild hereditary algebras. For a well written survey
on the subjects we refer to [1], [10] and [11]. Recall the deﬁnition of the dimension function
