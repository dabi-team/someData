Abstract We characterize a niobium-based superconducting quantum inter-
ference proximity transistor (Nb-SQUIPT) built upon a Nb-Cu-Nb SNS weak
link. The Nb-SQUIPT and SNS devices are fabricated simultaneously in two
separate lithography and deposition steps, relying on Ar ion cleaning of the Nb
contact surfaces. The quality of the Nb-Cu interface is characterized by mea-
suring the temperature-dependent equilibrium critical supercurrent of the SNS
junction. In the Nb-SQUIPT device, we observe a maximum ﬂux-to-current
transfer function value of about 55 nA/Φ0 in the sub-gap regime of bias volt-
ages. This results in suppression of power dissipation down to a few fW. The
device can implement a low-dissipation SQUIPT, improving by up to two or-
ders of magnitude compared to a conventional device based on an Al-Cu-Al
SNS junction and an Al tunnel probe (Al-SQUIPT).

1 Introduction

The superconducting quantum interference proximity transistor (SQUIPT) [1]
is a sensitive magnetometer based on the proximity eﬀect [2,3,4,5,6,7]. The
SQUIPT consists of a superconducting loop (S1) interrupted by a normal metal
(N) in clean contact with it while a superconducting probe (S2) is tunnel cou-
pled to the middle of the weak link. The operation of the device relies on
the magnetic ﬁeld modulation of the DoS [4,8,9,10] in the proximized normal
metal (N) [11,12,13] embedded between superconducting electrodes (S1), re-
sulting in the opening of a minigap [4,8,14] in the N part. As shown in Fig. 1,
the superconducting loop and probe are Nb and Al, respectively. A large num-
ber of applications has been proposed for SQUIPTs, similar to SQUIDs [15,16,
17], including measurement of magnetic ﬂux induced by atomic spins, single-
photon detection and nanoelectronical measurements [18, 19,20]. The SQUIPT
represents a sensitive interferometer with reduced power dissipation and po-
tentially low ﬂux noise in contrast to conventional SQUIDs [1,21]. So far, a
number of SQUIPT devices with an aluminum tunnel probe (S-SQUIPT) [1,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26,27,28,29] have been reported due to the high quality native
oxide of Al, yielding excellent tunnel barriers [27].

The ﬂux sensitivity of a SQUIPT device can be improved by maximizing
the proximity eﬀect in the normal metal N, hence increasing the responsivity
of the device to a change in magnetic ﬁeld. In this respect, replacing the su-
perconducting loop with a larger-gap superconductor such as vanadium [27]
or niobium [25] is an evident direction to look for sensitive SQUIPTs. Re-
cently, a device with normal-conducting probe (N-SQUIPT) has been shown
to be a promising candidate for the implementation of SQUIPTs with very
low dissipated power [29]. However, implementing low dissipation S-SQUIPTs
has not been explored in detail up to now. Operating the S-SQUIPT at sub-
gap bias voltages on the supercurrent branch allows to obtain extra-low power
dissipation, reduced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to earlier
devices [1,23]. In this article, we present a detailed experimental demonstra-
tion of Nb-Cu-Nb weak links and a SQUIPT based on a Nb superconducting
loop (Nb-SQUIPT), ﬁrst considered in Ref. 25. The devices are realized using
an etching-based two-step fabrication process. We ﬁrst characterize Nb-Cu-
Nb junctions through low temperature switching current measurement and
then investigate a Nb-SQUIPT, obtained by attaching an Al tunnel probe to
the SNS weak link. In this prototype magnetometer, we observe the maxi-
mum ﬂux-to-current transfer function value of about |∂I/∂Φ|max ≈ 55 nA/Φ0
at T = 80 mK, which has been measured close to zero bias voltage. Here,
Φ0 = h/(2e) is the superconducting ﬂux quantum.

2 Experimental methods and fabrication

Both Nb-SQUIPT devices and Nb-Cu-Nb junctions on the same chip are fab-
ricated using a process with two separate electron beam lithography (EBL)
steps as discussed in detail in Ref. 25. The ﬁrst step accomplishes patterning
of the Nb structures. We start with an oxidized 4 inch Si wafer with 200 nm
sputter-deposited Nb. In the ﬁrst lithography step, we write into a layer of
spin-coated positive tone AR-P 6200.13 resist. The lithography is followed by
wet development and 5 min reﬂow baking at 150◦C. In order to transfer the
exposed pattern into the Nb ﬁlm, reactive ion etching (RIE) is used with a
mixture of SF6 and Ar. Nb etching is followed by the second EBL step us-
ing a conventional bilayer resist [30], consisting of a 200 nm thick polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) layer on top of a 900 nm layer of copolymer. This step
provides the NIS tunnel junction and the Cu wire, and importantly, the clean
electrical contacts between Nb and Cu in the Nb-Cu-Nb weak link.

The creation of a transparent contact between Nb and Cu is achieved by
exposing the chip to in situ Ar ion etching, prior to the Cu deposition in
the same vacuum cycle. The Nb-Cu-Nb weak link and Nb-SQUIPT devices
with an Al-AlOx-Cu Normal metal−Insulator−Superconductor (NIS) tunnel
junction are simultaneously fabricated: After Ar etching, 25 nm of Al at an
angle θ = 27◦ is deposited and oxidized for 1−5 min at a pressure of 1−5 mbar
to form the tunnel barrier of the NIS probe. Next, approximately 25 nm Cu at
θ = −14◦ is evaporated to complete the NIS junction and to form the normal

mK.

3 Results and discussion

The relevant dimensions of a typical measured SNS structure [see inset of
Fig. 2(b)] are the minimum Nb electrode separation L1 = 0.49 µm, the full
length L2 = 2.15 µm and minimum width w = 0.54 µm of the Cu wire.
We measure typical low temperature resistance value of the Cu strip to be
about 0.4 Ω. In the diﬀusive SNS junction, the Thouless energy ETh = ¯hD/L2
determines the energy scale for the proximity eﬀect. Here D and L are the
diﬀusion constant and the eﬀective length of the Cu wire, respectively [32,33,
34]. The eﬀective length of the normal metal L = 1.2 µm is derived from the

D = 0.01 m2s−1 [25]. The Nb-Cu-Nb sample considered here is in the long
junction limit L ≈ 16 ξ0, where ξ0 = (cid:112)¯hD/∆ is the coherence length and
∆ ≈ 1.2 meV the superconducting energy gap of Nb.

The current-voltage characteristic of the Nb-Cu-Nb structure is shown in
the main panel of Fig. 2(b) at diﬀerent values of bath temperatures. The dc
voltage VSNS is measured across the structure biased by a current ISNS in a
four probe conﬁguration as indicated in the inset of Fig. 2(b). As shown by
the IV curves, the hysteretic behavior from self-heating in the ﬁnite-voltage
state is observable at T < 650 mK and hence the magnitudes of switching Isw
and retrapping Ir current diﬀer from each other. At the base temperature, we
ﬁnd them to be about 30 µA and 6 µA, respectively.

An IV characteristic of the Nb-SQUIPT is illustrated in Fig. 3(a), mea-
sured at two diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds, Φ = 0 (red) and Φ = 0.5 Φ0 (blue),
corresponding to maximum and minimum minigap opened in the normal weak
link [10,14]. Furthermore, the ﬂux-dependent onset of current on the quasi-
particle branch is shown in the inset when |V | exceeds the sum of the probe
electrode gap ∆Al/e and the minigap induced in the N part. In the diﬀusive

regime of a metallic SNS junction, the minigap in the normal metal is of the
order of the Thouless energy ETh [6]. Considering the bias voltage depen-
dence of the diﬀerential conductance [22,23] and subtracting the contribution
of an eﬀective series resistance RS = 1 kΩ, arising from the two point mea-
surement technique, the magnitudes of the superconducting probe electrode
gap and minigap are ∆Al = 253 µeV and ∆g = 27 µeV, respectively. As a
consequence of the minigap variations, the current I(Φ) is periodic as a func-
tion of the ﬂux through the loop. Typical current modulations are displayed
in Fig. 3(c) for some selected values of bias voltages V in the quasiparticle
branch from 250 µV to 320 µV. Figure 3(c) indicates that the measured cur-
rent modulation reaches a peak-to-peak amplitude as large as δI = 5.5 nA
at the bias voltage V = 300 µV. We now consider the ﬂux modulation in
the low bias regime. Figure 4(a) demonstrates the extent of the ﬂux modula-
tion of the IV curve in the sub-gap regime close to zero bias at two diﬀerent
temperatures, T = 80 mK (blue) and T = 190 mK (red). At T = 190 mK,
almost full magnetic ﬂux modulation of the IV is visible due to increased
SNS weak link inductance in comparison to the loop inductance [24]. We can
furthermore observe current peak at the bias voltage V = 30 µV with the
maximum current Imax = 3.6 nA. It is caused by multiple Andreev reﬂec-

tions, which are visible due to relatively low tunnel resistance of the probe
junction, RT = 1 kΩ. In this sub-gap regime, the current modulation as a
function of magnetic ﬂux I(Φ) is shown in Fig. 4(b) at few selected values
of applied bias voltage. At |V | ≈ 30 µV, we ﬁnd the maximum peak-to-peak
amplitude as large as δI ≈ 2.5 nA, corresponding to the maximum sensitivity
|∂I/∂Φ|max ≈ 55 nA/Φ0. The eﬀect of temperature T on the ﬂux-to-current
transfer function is displayed in Fig. 4(c), showing the temperature dependence
of the maximum sensitivity in the low bias regime. It decreases monotonously
with increasing T . For comparison, the transfer functions close to the optimum
bias values in the supercurrent and quasiparticle regions are plotted in Fig. 5.
We now discuss the bias voltage dependence of the maximum sensitivity
|∂I/∂Φ|max at the base temperature T ≈ 80 mK. Figure 6 indicates that the
maximum current responsivity is obtained at |V | (cid:39) 30 µV, corresponding to
|∂I/∂Φ|max ≈ 55 nA/Φ0. At this working point, the typical output current
level is I ≈ 3 nA implying an average total power dissipation for the Nb-
SQUIPT to be below 10−13 W. The value can be further reduced by simply
increasing the resistance of the probing junction. This power is two orders of
magnitude smaller than in our previous device with an Al superconducting
probe [23]. The sub-gap operation of a SQUIPT is thus a possible choice
for applications where very low dissipation is required. Let us now brieﬂy
discuss the mechanism behind the SQUIPT response to the magnetic ﬁeld at

low bias. Considering ﬁrst an ideal case, we assume that the response comes
from the Josepshson current of the probe junction, which is modulated by the
ﬁeld together with the minigap in the copper island. The expected value of
the critical current may be estimated by means of the Ambegaokar-Baratoﬀ
formula [35] for an asymmetric junction with the gaps of the leads ∆g(Φ) and
∆Al. With the junction resistance RT = 1 kΩ we ﬁnd a maximum critical
current IC = 150 nA.

Assuming now that the minigap is modulated as ∆g(Φ) ≈ ∆g |cos(πΦ/Φ0)|,
we can estimate the maximum responsivity of the device as ∼ πIC/Φ0 ≈ 500
nA/Φ0, which is about 10 times higher than in the experiment. Unfortunately,
in our sample we observe only a very small critical current IC = 2.4 nA,
which, on top of that, is not modulated by ﬂux, and this simple mechanism
is not working. However, our analysis shows that improving the quality of the
probe junction may potentially increase the sensitivity of the SQUIPT. We
believe that the observed low-bias current modulation in our device comes
from multiple Andreev reﬂections (MAR). The tunnel barrier of the probe
junction is rather transparent (overlap size 310 nm × 510 nm, characteristic
resistance ≈ 150 Ωµm2) and MAR signatures are clearly visible in the I-V
curve plotted in Fig. 7. The observed pattern agrees well with the one expected
for a junction between two diﬀerent superconductors with the gaps ∆g and ∆Al
[36]. Namely, we ﬁnd current peaks at eV = ∆g, eV = ∆Al, a current jump

∆Al/3e etc. In terms of responsivity at low bias, the MAR peak centered
around ∆g/e = 27 µV is important. The position of this peak follows the
magnetic ﬁeld dependent minigap ∆g(Φ), which results in the modulation
of the current at ﬁxed voltage shown in Fig. 4(b). The peak is smeared by
increasing temperature and eventually vanishes at T > ∆g/kB ≈ 300 mK, see
Fig. 4(c).

4 Summary

To summarize, we have investigated Nb-Cu-Nb weak links and, consequently,
a Nb-SQUIPT at low bias voltages of the tunnel probe. The structures are
based on a fabrication process with two independent lithography and deposi-
tion steps, relying on Ar ion cleaning of the Nb contact surfaces. The typical
power dissipation in the fW range gives the opportunity of using the Nb-
SQUIPT as a low dissipation magnetometer and, furthermore, in other detec-
tor applications such as ultrasensitive bolometers and calorimeters.
