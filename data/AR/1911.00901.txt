Abstract

Active region (AR) NOAA 11476 produced a series of conﬁned plasma ejec-
tions, mostly accompanied by ﬂares of X-ray class M, from 08 to 10 May
2012. The structure and evolution of the conﬁned ejections resemble that
of EUV surges; however, their origin is associated to the destabilization and
eruption of a mini-ﬁlament, which lay along the photospheric inversion line
(PIL) of a large rotating bipole. Our analysis indicate that the bipole rota-
tion and ﬂux cancellation along the PIL have a main role in destabilizing the
structure and triggering the ejections. The observed bipole emerged within
the main following AR polarity. Previous studies have analyzed and dis-
cussed in detail two events of this series in which the mini-ﬁlament erupted
as a whole, one at 12:23 UT on 09 May and the other at 04:18 UT on 10
May. In this article we present the observations of the conﬁned eruption and
M4.1 ﬂare on 09 May 2012 at 21:01 UT (SOL2012-05-09T21:01:00) and the
previous activity in which the mini-ﬁlament was involved. For the analysis
we use data in multiple wavelengths (UV, EUV, X-rays, and magnetograms)
from space instruments. In this particular case, the mini-ﬁlament is seen to
erupt in two diﬀerent sections. The northern section erupted accompanied
by a C1.6 ﬂare and the southern section did it in association with the M4.1

location of a far ﬂare kernel, to where the plasma is seen to ﬂow, suggest
that both ejections and ﬂares follow a similar underlying mechanism.

1. Introduction

Solar activity produces several kinds of ejecta from full-ﬂedge coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) to surges, jets, and sprays. These ejections are character-
ized by their evolution, observed size, geometry, associated energies, and
masses involved, and sometimes are classiﬁed considering the instruments
with which they have been observed (Webb and Howard, 2012; Raouaﬁ et al.,
2016; Canﬁeld et al., 1996; Schmieder et al., 1996). For instance, the classiﬁ-
cation of phenomena like surges and sprays has its origin in Hα observations
(see e.g. Foukal, 2004). The main diﬀerence between them is that while ma-
terial in surges falls back down through the same magnetic structure through
which it was ejected, in sprays the ejected mass apparently reaches escape
velocity continuously ascending away from its point of origin in the chromo-
sphere or very low corona (see Webb and Jackson, 1981).

Recent investigations have associated coronal jets to the eruption of so-
called mini-ﬁlaments, whose plasma provides most of the ejected material
(Shen et al., 2012; Adams et al., 2014; Sterling et al., 2015, 2016; Panesar
et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2018; Yang and Zhang, 2018; Moore et al., 2018).
Even in cases of lower resolution observations, mini-ﬁlament reformation and
eruption has been postulated as the origin of a series of blow-out jets and re-
lated events (Chandra et al., 2017). In all the previous works, the mechanism
proposed for the destabilization of the mini-ﬁlament is the magnetic ﬂux can-
cellation along the polarity inversion line (PIL) above which the mini-ﬁlament
lays. Given the appropriate magnetic conﬁguration, two reconnection pro-
cesses may occur: a ﬁrst, ”inner”, reconnection process in the magnetic ﬁeld
below the mini-ﬁlament, usually associated to a ﬂare, and a second, ”exter-
nal” process produced by the ascent of the mini-ﬁlament, whose supporting
magnetic ﬁeld lines reconnect with the ones of the overlying magnetic ﬁeld
yielding the injection of material into open lines producing the jet (Sterling
et al., 2016).

2

The role of mini-ﬁlaments in the process just described led Wyper et al.
(2017, 2018) to suggest that jets are produced by the same kind of mechanism,
namely breakout reconnection, proposed to explain larger scale phenomena
like CMEs (see e.g. Karpen et al., 2012). The numerical conﬁguration in those
simulations consists of a magnetic bipole emerging in a uniform unipolar
magnetic ﬂux area. This kind of conﬁguration leads to the appearence of a
coronal null-point above the bipole. Shearing motions imposed on the system
provide free magnetic energy and produce a small ﬂux rope that supports the
mini-ﬁlament. The sheared magnetic structure expands and a reconnection
process is triggered in the region around the coronal null point. As in the
classical breakout model of CMEs, the reconnection removes part of the ﬁeld
restraining the ﬂux rope, so it is propeled to rapidly ascend. At the same
time, reconnection below the twisted ﬂux rope is stimulated, consistently
with the phenomenology described in the previous paragraph.

It has been observed in occasions that only part of the full structure of
the ﬁlament is ejected (see e.g. Cheng et al., 2018, and references therein).
In those cases, the ﬁlament splits in two or more segments, some of which
erupt at diﬀerent times or not at all (Zuccarello et al., 2009; Tripathi et al.,
2006; Chandra et al., 2010). This behaviour has been identiﬁed also in the
case of mini-ﬁlament eruptions associated to coronal jets (see e.g. Panesar
et al., 2017).

The ejections studied in this article occurred in a similar magnetic conﬁg-
uration to that proposed to explain coronal jets, i.e. the presence of bipolar
structures in the middle of a more extended unipolar region, in this case, the
extended following polarity of active region (AR) NOAA 11576. A large mag-
netic bipole is observed to rotate along serveral tens of hours accompanied
by a series of eruptions associated to ﬂares. One of these, which occurred on
09 May 2012 at 12:23 UT, has been extensively analyzed by us in previous
articles (L´opez Fuentes et al., 2015; L´opez Fuentes et al., 2018), and another,
which occurred on 10 May 2012 04:18 UT, was studied by Yang and Zhang
(2018). The main diﬀerence between the events studied here and a regular
jet is that the ejected material remained conﬁned within the closed magnetic
structure of the AR instead of reaching open ﬁeld lines. After the eruption,
the ejected material ascended along ﬁeld lines that connected the main po-
larities of the AR, part of it reached the farther footpoints of the lines, and
part of it fell back to the region where the ejection initiated. This observed
evolution resembled that of Hα and EUV surges (see the aforementioned
references).

The main EUV event analyzed here occurred in AR 11576 on 09 May 2012
and was associated to an M4.1 ﬂare with a peak in GOES soft X-ray light
curve at ≈ 21:01 UT. A close inspection of high resolution observations pre-
vious to the event, in the 304 ˚A band of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA: Lemen et al., 2012), onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO),
indicates the presence of a mini-ﬁlament whose following eruption, accompa-
nied by reconnection with the overlaying ﬁeld, constitutes the main source of
the ejected material. The extended analysis some tens of minutes before the
main M4.1 event indicates that a previous smaller ejection ocurred 36 min
before, involving the eruption of a diﬀerent section of the same mini-ﬁlament.
This previous event was associated to a less energetic C1.6 ﬂare with peak
intensity at ≈ 20:25 UT.

In Sections 2.2–2.4, we analyze the evolution of both conﬁned eruptions
and accompanying ﬂares in several wavelengths using data from the instru-
ments described in Section 2.1.
In Section 3 we compare these successive
events with the one analyzed by L´opez Fuentes et al. (2018) and interperet
our observations in the frame of that study.
In Section 4 we present our
concluding remarks.

2. Observations and Characteristics of the Events

2.1. The Data Used

To study the ﬂares and conﬁned eruptions we use UV continuum and EUV
data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012),
onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and EUV observations from
the Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI:
Howard et al., 2008), onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory
(STEREO) spacecraft B, soft X-ray data from the X-ray Telescope (XRT:
Golub et al., 2007) onboard Hinode, and magnetograms from the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al., 2012), onboard SDO. Figure 1
depicts the soft X-ray curve in the 1 – 8 ˚A channel, where we have identiﬁed
with arrows and labels both ﬂaring events, as well as the one that occurred
at 12:23 UT (L´opez Fuentes et al., 2018), and the one that occurred at 04:18
UT on May 10 (Yang and Zhang, 2018).

SDO/AIA data are from the 1700 ˚A channel (from now on AIA 1700,
T ≈ 5000 K) and 304 ˚A channel (AIA 304, T ≈ 5×104 K). Both events
are observed in AIA 304, while only the ﬂare at 21:01 UT is observed in
AIA 1700. We select subimages containing AR 11576 from full-disk data for

4

the temporal range covering the analyzed events. We coalign the subimages
and construct movies that are associated to the ﬁgures of Section 2.3. All
images are displayed in logarithmic intensity scales for better contrast. We
complement the SDO/AIA EUV data with images of the events from the
195 ˚A channel of the SECCHI instrument. We use this band because it
has the highest temporal resolution (5 minutes) in SECCHI. On the day of
our events, STEREO-B was at an Earth ecliptic (HEE) longitude of -118◦
away from Earth, from this location AR 11576 was seen in the solar limb.
SDO/HMI data are line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms, which are selected
from full-disk images to study the evolution of the AR magnetic ﬁeld (see
Section 2.2).

2.2. Summary of the Photospheric Magnetic Field Evolution

The magnetic evolution of AR 11476 from appearance, on the eastern solar
limb, on 04 May 2012 until the end of 10 May has been discussed in detail
by L´opez Fuentes et al. (2018). We summarize here their main results.

AR 11476 had a global bipolar structure; its preceding negative polarity
was compact and was followed by a very dispersed following positive polarity
(see Figure 2). By 7 May two bipoles, which we have labeled as B1 and
B2 in Figure 2, were seen in the middle of the AR main positive polarity.
The magnetogram in this ﬁgure corresponds to 20:00 UT, 25 min before
the ﬁrst event analyzed here. In the panels of Figure 3 we show the bipole
orientations at the times of particular events. Figure 3a corresponds roughly
to the time of GOES soft X-ray peak of the M4.7 ﬂare on 9 May at 12:23 UT,
Figure 3b to approximately the time of GOES peak of the M4.1 ﬂare analyzed
in this article, Figure 3c depicts the bipole locations at approximately the
time of an M5.7 ﬂare peak at 04:18 UT on 10 May, while the last panel
shows the magnetic conﬁguration of the AR much later, when both bipoles
had long ago stopped rotating and the negative polarity of B1 had almost
disappeared. Both ﬂares studied here and their related conﬁned eruptions or
surges, originated in the neighborhood of B1 and B2.

The bipoles, B1 and B2 were seen rotating clockwise. B1 rotated by ≈ 180◦
from 8 May at 00:00 UT to 10 May at 22:00 UT, while B2 rotated by ≈ 100◦
from the same starting time until ≈ 10:00 UT on 10 May. The rotation of
each bipole is characterized by the rotation of their tilt angle, which is deter-
mined following the method developed by Poisson et al. (2015). We include a
movie showing the bipole rotations (bipole-rotation.mov) as supplementary
material. The bipole rotations imply the injection of magnetic helicity and

accompanied by labels indicating the X-ray class and time of the ﬂares. As a reference we
identify the peak of the event at 12:23 UT that was studied by L´opez Fuentes et al. (2018)
and that of the event at 4:18 UT studied by Yang and Zhang (2018). The peak between
the C1.6 and M4.1 ﬂares, indicated with a red arrow, corresponds to a ﬂare associated to
the neighboring jet that occurred next to AR 11576 to the east at 20:45 UT and that is
mentioned in Section 2.3.

arrows in panel a point to the locations of the bipoles. Panels a – c correspond approxi-
mately to the times of the M ﬂares on 9 and 10 May, while panel d shows the AR when
B1 had almost completely disappeared. Blue corresponds to negative magnetic ﬁeld and
red to positive ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld contours in pink correspond to ±200 G. The axes
are in arcsec. The black and white dots correspond to the location of the negative and
positive magnetic barycenters of bipole B1, computed following the method described by
Poisson et al. (2015). The evolution of the black segment joining the barycenters of B1
indicates the variation of the bipole tilt angle, deﬁned here in the usual way, accordingly
to Joy’s law, as the bipole inclination with respect to the solar equator. A movie show-
ing this rotation along three days is appended to this article as supplementary material
(bipole-rotation.mov).

consequently the accumulation of free magnetic energy; this evolution might
contribute to the destabilization and eruption of the mini-ﬁlament during all
the observed ﬂares as proposed by Wyper et al. (2017, 2018). Furthermore,
as we measured the bipole rotations, we also computed their magnetic ﬂux.
We found that the ﬂuxes of B1 and B2 decreased steeply. In the case of B1 its
ﬂux mainly cancelled with the surrounding magnetic ﬁeld, while in the case
of B2 it was probably mostly dispersed. As discussed in Section 1, magnetic
ﬂux cancellation has been observed associated with surges and jets. Figure 4
depicts the rotation of the tilt angle and the magnetic ﬂux evolution of B1
from 8 May to 10 May. B1 is the largest and main bipole involved in the
events studied in this article.

2.3. UV Continuum and EUV Evolution as Seen from Earth

Figures 5 and 7 show AIA 304 images at the times of the ﬁrst partial mini-
ﬁlament eruption and accompanying C1.6 ﬂare, and of the M4.1 ﬂare and
second partial mini-ﬁlament eruption, respectively. An HMI magnetogram
contour is overlaid on the images in Figure 5a and Figure 7a as a reference.

9

As discussed in Section 1, recent observations relate jets to the eruption
of mini-ﬁlaments, which are smaller versions of normal large-scale ﬁlaments.
In the events analyzed in this article we ﬁnd evidence of the partial eruption
of a curved mini-ﬁlament that extends all along the PIL of B1. This mini-
ﬁlament is observed to erupt and reform several times from 8 May to 10 May.
We infer that the continuous rotation and ﬂux cancellation of B1 along these
days contribute to the mini-ﬁlament reformation and destabilization. We
include as supplementary material a movie with high temporal resolution
(5 images per minute) in AIA 304 showing both ﬂares and mini-ﬁlament
eruptions (aia304.mp4). In the movie a jet is also observed at the east of
the AR (right at the left border of the images) occurring around 20:45 UT.
This event is unrelated to those studied here as it occurred away from the
bipole areas where the mini-ﬁlament eruptions and ﬂares took place. A ﬂare
associated to this jet is identiﬁed in Figure 1 with a red arrow (no label)
between the C1.6 and M4.1 ﬂares.

Figure 5 illustrates the initiation and evolution of the ﬁrst event. High
resolution imagers, like SDO/AIA, allow us to clearly observe a curved dark
structure with one section oriented in the NE–SW direction (henceforth, the
northern section) and another oriented in the NW-SE direction (henceforth,
the southern section, see also Figure 6b). These two sections have been
pointed with black arrows in Figure 5b. Figure 5c shows the appearance
of two bright kernels (indicated with a white arrow) that we consider to be
the footpoints of a short arcade formed as the mini-ﬁlament northern section
erupts. At the same time, a dense plasma eruption is seen extending towards
the W. Figure 5d shows the eruption at its maximum extension reaching a far
kernel, indicated with a white arrow, that globally has the same shape as the
far kernel observed during the earlier event at 12:23 UT. Another elongated
brightening, pointed by a white arrow in Figure 5b and d, is also seen to the
W on the main negative AR polarity. The location of the ﬁrst ﬂare kernels,
as well as the place from where the mini-ﬁlament eruption initiates, indicates
that only the northern section of the mini-ﬁlament erupts.

In Figure 6 we show an enlargement of the image in Figure 5a and b.
Figure 6a shows the magnetic map as a reference.
In this panel we have
numbered the main polarities involved in the events studied in this arti-
cle. Figure 6b corresponds to the AIA 304 image where the shape of the
mini-ﬁlament before both eruptions can be more clearly seen. For an eas-
ier identiﬁcation of the mini-ﬁlament portions we added an inset showing a
further enlargement of the bipole area. The north and south portions for

10

the mini-ﬁlament are indicated both in Figure 6b and in the inset. Notice
the presence of a circular-shape brightening, pointed by a white arrow in
Figure 5b (also observable in Figure 6b), that surrounds all the negative and
part of the postitive polarity of B1 and all of B2, as happened in the event
at 12:23 UT. This circular brightening is present since around 08 May, which
strongly suggests that energy release at a very low rate occurred accompa-
nying the rotation of the bipoles plausibly because of their interaction with
the overlaying magnetic ﬁeld.

Figure 7 shows the evolution of the second surge and associated M4.1 ﬂare
as observed in the AIA 304 band. As in Figure 5, in Figure 7a we include an
SDO/HMI contour as a reference to easily identify the location of the main
AR polarities and B1 and B2 bipoles. In Figure 7b we indicate with a black
arrow the remaining southern portion of the mini-ﬁlament, which is seen
prominently right before starting to rise. In Figure 7c, the mini-ﬁlament is
observed already ascending and an incipient brightening is noticeable below
it. In Figure 7d, all the area around B1 is seen bright as the peak intensity of
the ﬂare happens. The mini-ﬁlament material is ejected and it is part of the
ascending bright front whose evolution is seen in the following panels (e and
f). The full evolution can be followed in the AIA 304 movie accompanying
this article as supplementary material (aia304.mp4). Notice also the far
brightening located at the AR main negative polarity and indicated with
white arrows in Figure 7d and f. As this area brightens consequently with
the M4.1 ﬂare development, we infer that it is another kernel of the ﬂare,
as we show in the description of Figure 8 in what follows. As observed in
Figure 7e and f, and in the accompanying movie, the ejected material travels
along magnetic loops connecting the area surrounding the bipoles with this
far kernel.

From the observed evolution of the ascending surge front in AIA 304 data
we can estimate its velocity in the plane of the sky. By following the vertical
motion of the bright front from the original location of the mini-ﬁlament to
the maximum volumetric extent of the surge we estimate a mean velocity
of approximately 280 km s−1. We obtained this velocity by tracking the
front along successive images and then computing the slope of the position
versus time curve, from the original ﬁlament location to the farthest position
reached by the surge front. Although this velocity is higher than the 190 km
s−1 obtained for the 12:23 UT surge studied by L´opez Fuentes et al. (2018), it
is still within the usual values observed in this kind of events (Raouaﬁ et al.,
2016).

extending along the PIL of B1 is visible (see also Figure 6b). Two black arrows point to
the northern portion of the mini-ﬁlament, which is oriented in the NE–SW direction, and

indicate the location of the circular brightening and another one located on the negative
AR main polarity to the W (see text for details). (c) Shows two bright kernels that we

mini-ﬁlament eruptions, is attached as electronic supplementary material (aia304.mp4).

In order to identify the locations of the main M4.1 ﬂare kernels, we analyze
AIA 1700 images. The C1.6 ﬂare is not visible in this AIA band. Figure 8
shows a series of images in AIA 1700. In Figure 8b–d the ﬂare kernels and

kernels using the same letters as L´opez Fuentes et al. (2018) used in their
analysis of the event at 12:23 UT. The location of the initial emission in this
band, as well as its evolution, together with the AIA 304 evolution discussed
in the previous paragraph, suggests that it is the southern section of the
mini-ﬁlament that erupts in association with the M4.1 ﬂare. Notice that the
far kernel to where the plasma is observed to ﬂow in AIA 304 during this
second mini-ﬁlament eruption is barely seen in this band. We include as
supplementary material a movie with the highest temporal resolution in AIA
1700 showing the M4.1 ﬂare and the second mini-ﬁlament partial eruption
(aia1700.mp4); in this movie we can see that some plasma appears ﬂowing
up at this temperature range. Notice the bright kernels associated to the jet
at the east of the AR (right at the left border of the images) that starts at
approximately 20:45 UT. As we mentioned before, this event is unrelated to
those studied here.

As mentioned in L´opez Fuentes et al. (2018), several EUV surges can be
identiﬁed in AIA 304 when examining images in this band in Helioviewer
(www.helioviewer.org). All these surges are associated to M-class ﬂares, ex-
cept the ﬁrst partial eruption studied in this article at ≈ 20:25 UT. The more
extended surges are: one on 8 May at ≈13:05 UT (ﬂare M1.4), another one
on 9 May at ≈ 12:23 UT (ﬂare M4.7, see L´opez Fuentes et al., 2018), the
one analyzed here at ≈ 21:01 UT (ﬂare M4.1), and two on 10 May at ≈
04:15 UT (ﬂare M5.7, see Yang and Zhang, 2018) and at ≈ 20:25 UT (ﬂare
M1.7). All these M-class ﬂares and surges started mainly at the location of
the largest rotating bipole (B1) and the plasma was launched along large-
scale loops with far footpoints on the negative main AR polarity to the W.
This series of events suggests a recurrence of energy storage, mini-ﬁlament
reformation as proposed by Chandra et al. (2017) (see also the simulations
of Wyper et al., 2017, 2018), and energy release processes in a time range
between around 8 and 23 hours.

2.4. EUV Evolution as Seen by STEREO-B

As described in Section 2.1, at the time of the studied events the STEREO
probe B was located in an orbital position from which AR 11576 was observ-
able on the solar limb. This provides us the vantage point of a side view

second surge. In (e) and (f) the front of the second surge is indicated with white arrows 5
min and 10 min after the eruption begins. The associated M4.1 ﬂare is also observable as
an extended area of saturated pixels at the base of the ejected structure. The full evolution
observed from STEREO B can be seen in the accompanying movie (stereo195.mp4).

to observe the ejections. In Figure 9 we show a series of SECCHI images
in the 195˚A band (hereafter SECCHI 195) covering both surge evolutions.
The cadence of this set of images is 5 min. In Figure 9a we show an image
of AR 11576 right before the ﬁrst event took place (at 20:20 UT). By 20:30
UT (Figure 9b) we identify a bright ascending front, indicated with a white
arrow, that coresponds to our ﬁrst surge. It can be still observed progressing
in Figure 9c (20:35 UT), where we identiﬁed the highest point of the surge
front with a white arrow. Regarding the evolution of the second surge, in
Figure 9d (21:00 UT), we point with a white arrow the location of the mini-
ﬁlament portion associated to this eruption, as observed from STEREO. In
Figure 9e and f (21:05 UT and 21:10 UT, respectively), the white arrows in-
dicate the position of the ascending surge front. Notice the bright saturated
pixels at the base of the erupting material produced by the associated M4.1
ﬂare. The evolution can be fully observed in the short movie accompanying
this article as supplementary material (stereo195.mp4).

Although the cadence of the SECCHI 195 data does not allow a continuous
track of the erupted material as in the case of AIA 304, we can still observe
the mini-ﬁlament just before the ejection begins and the ejected material at
a high altitude 5 min later. Therefore, we can make a very rough estimation
of the mean velocity of the surge by dividing the observed distance traveled
by the material by the time diﬀerence between the images in Figure 9d and
f. The mean velocity estimated in this way is approximately 300 km s−1,
which is consistent with the result obtained from the AIA 304 analysis.

3. Comparing the phenomenology of the conﬁned ejections on 9

May 2012

In this section we compare the conﬁned eruptions of 9 May 2012, which
were associated to the M4.7, the C1.6, and M4.1 ﬂares occurring at 12:23,
20:25, and 21:01 UT, respectively, as identiﬁed in Figure 1. In L´opez Fuentes
et al. (2018) we performed a detailed study of the magnetic ﬁeld connectivity
in the regions where the ﬂare kernels were located and interpreted our ob-
servational results in terms of the magnetic ﬁeld topology of AR 11576. We
interpret the observations of the two successive ﬂares and conﬁned eruptions,
just discussed, in the context of our previous results in view that the mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration has not changed substantially, i.e. the main change
is the continuous rotation of B1 and B2.

Figure 10: 3D sketch showing sets of ﬁeld lines connecting the diﬀerent polarities identiﬁed
in Figure 6 and the relative location of the mini-ﬁlament. As the mini-ﬁlament rises two
reconnection processes occur, as identiﬁed with thick green segments: the internal one
below the mini-ﬁlament and the external one above it, which reconnects (blue) ﬁeld lines
connecting polarities 3 and 4 with ﬁeld lines connecting 1 and 2. This latter process
eventually yields the injection of mini-ﬁlament material in ﬁeld lines connecting 3 and 2
and 4 and 1 (highlighted in red color) producing the observed eruption. See Section 3 for
a detailed description.

19

It is clear from Figure 5 that only the northern section of the mini-
ﬁlament erupts at around 20:25 UT, when two small ﬂare kernels are seen
at both sides of the northern section of the PIL of B1. A C1.6 ﬂare ac-
companies the eruption; this is a faint event compared to the other ones
on 9 May, in particular, it is not even classiﬁed as a ﬂare in SolarMoni-
tor (https://www.solarmonitor.org/). Based on the magnetic ﬁeld topology
computed in L´opez Fuentes et al. (2018), the evolution seen in the movie
that accompanies this article (aia304.mp4), and the diﬀerent panels in Fig-
ure 5, we infer that the continuous rotation of B1 and ﬂux cancellation at its
PIL, produces an instability triggering this ejection. When this happens, the
mini-ﬁlament starts to rise and two reconnection processes set in. Magnetic
ﬁeld lines connecting polarities 3 and 4 (see Figure 6a), at both sides of the
PIL, reconnect below the mini-ﬁlament, in what is called internal reconnec-
tion. Figure 10 shows a 3D sketch of the magnetic ﬁeld lines connecting
the diﬀerent polarities and the relative position of the mini-ﬁlament. The
internal reconnection site is identiﬁed with a thick green segment below the
mini-ﬁlament location in Figure 10. This process creates a new set of ﬁeld
lines whose footpoints are located at both sides of the PIL, clearly seen in
Figure 5c as the two bright kernels pointed with a white arrow. The other
set of reconnected ﬁeld lines surrounds the mini-ﬁlament. Simultaneously,
and as the mini-ﬁlament rises, the closed ﬁeld lines above it that still con-
nect 3 and 4 are forced to reconnect with those connecting 2 and 1. This
reconnection process is called external and is identiﬁed with a thick green
segment above the mini-ﬁlament location in Figure 10. In this process the
mini-ﬁlament plasma has access to the large-scale ﬁeld lines connecting 4
and 1 and we observe the surge ﬂowing towards the southern portion of the
far kernel to the W in 1, pointed with a white arrow in Figure 5d. Notice
that in this case the loops connecting 4 and 1 are shorter and probably not
as high as those in the surge observed associated to the ﬂare at 12:23 UT
and the later one at 21:01 UT. Because of the surge and other brightenings,
the counterpart kernel in 4 is not evident in AIA images. At the same time
we should have seen part of the mini-ﬁlament plasma reaching a ﬂare kernel
located in 2, in a similar way as happens with the surge at 12:23 UT; however
as these events are less energetic than the latter one, this is not visible in
the 304 movie. Anyway, a ﬂare kernel is located in 2 at around 20:23 UT
and later (see the white arrow to the east in Figure 5c. Summarizing, this
fainter ﬂare and conﬁned ejection can be explained in a similar way as the
events at 12:23 UT, but in this particular case only the northern portion of

20

the mini-ﬁlament is ejected.

As we show in Figure 7 the origin of the events at 21:01 UT was the
ejection of the southern portion of the mini-ﬁlament on the PIL of bipole B1.
In this particular case, the ﬂare and eruption are homologous to the events
studied by L´opez Fuentes et al. (2018). In Figure 8b we have labeled the
ﬂare kernels as k1, k2, k3 and k3’, and k4 and k4’, using the same notation
as in that article. We associate these kernels to the location of the polarity
regions labeled as shown in Figure 6a. Kernels k3’and k4’ are located in
polarities 3 and 4 and are the result of the internal reconnection process
that sets in when the southern portion of the mini-ﬁlament destabilizes and
starts rising. Kernels k4 and k1, as well as kernels k2 and k3, result from the
external reconnection process when the loops above the rising mini-ﬁlament
and linking polarities 3 and 4 reconnect with the overlying closed ﬁeld lines
connecting 2 and 1 (see Figure 10).

Finally, we notice that, even with the high spatial resolution of AIA im-
ages, it is not clear if the mini-ﬁlament at the time of the events studied
here is formed by two sections and, therefore, we have no clue of why the
mini-ﬁlament erupts in two sections.

4. Concluding Remarks

We studied a two-step mini-ﬁlament eruption in AR NOAA 11576 on 9
May 2012, at 20:25 UT and 21:01 UT. These eruptions were observed as
EUV surges in SDO/AIA data and occurred in conjunction with a C1.6
and an M4.1 ﬂares, identiﬁed in the GOES soft X-ray emission curve. We
studied the evolution of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld of the AR, observed
in SDO/HMI magnetograms, and related these events to the rotation and
ﬂux cancellation of bipolar structures located in the middle of the AR main
positive polarity.

By identifying the ﬂare kernels and comparing them with the previous
event at 12:23 UT, in Section 3 we propose a phenomenological explanation
of both eruptions. This is done in terms of the ejection of two sections of a
mini-ﬁlament located along the PIL of the largest rotating bipole, magnetic
connections between the magnetic polarities of the AR conﬁguration, and
reconnection processes between ﬁeld lines connecting these polarities. The
location of ﬂare kernels, the shape of the brightened structures, and the
observed evolution suggest that the same magnetic topology found by L´opez
Fuentes et al. (2018) is present during the events studied in this article.

21

Except for the fact that the mini-ﬁlament material is ejected through
closed magnetic ﬁeld lines that connect the main polarities of the AR, the
studied events resemble the kind of evolution observed and modeled in previ-
ous works for jets (see e.g. Sterling et al., 2016; Wyper et al., 2017, 2018, and
other references in the Introduction), for which the material is ejected along
open magnetic ﬁeld lines. Our study conﬁrms the role of mini-ﬁlaments in the
development of jets and surges and contributes to understand the magnetic
conﬁgurations and evolution associated to this kind of events. In particular,
we further conﬁrm the suggestion proposed in previous works (see references
in Section 1), that the repeated mini-ﬁlament reconstructions and eruptions
accompanied by ﬂares, as observed in AR 11576, are sustained by the con-
tinuous rotation and ﬂux cancellation of the bipolar structures located in
the middle of the AR main positive polarity. Although our study focuses
on events of the surge type, in which the ejected material falls back to the
coronal base, the similarity of the processes producing the events analyzed
here and jet observations (both standard and blow-out) studied elsewhere,
suggest the possibility that other typical ejections, such as Hα sprays (see
references in Section 1), might be produced by similar mechanisms. This
possibility would need to be addressed in future high resolution studies of
solar ejective phenomena.
