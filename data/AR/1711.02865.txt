Abstract: The focus of this chapter lies on the possible experimental tests of
leptogenesis scenarios. We consider both leptogenesis generated from oscilla-
tions, as well as leptogenesis from out-of-equilibrium decays. As the Akhmedov-
Rubakov-Smirnov (ARS) mechanism allows for heavy neutrinos in the GeV range,
this opens up a plethora of possible experimental tests, e.g. at neutrino oscilla-
tion experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay, and direct searches for neutral
heavy leptons at future facilities. In contrast, testing leptogenesis from out-of-
equilibrium decays is a quite diﬃcult task. We comment on the necessary con-
ditions for having successful leptogenesis at the TeV-scale. We further discuss
possible realizations and their model speciﬁc testability in extended seesaw mod-
els, models with extended gauge sectors, and supersymmetric leptogenesis. Not
being able to test high-scale leptogenesis directly, we present a way to falsify such
scenarios by focusing on their washout processes. This is discussed speciﬁcally
for the left-right symmetric model and the observation of a heavy WR, as well as
model independently when measuring ∆L = 2 washout processes at the LHC or
neutrinoless double beta decay.

As the Standard Model (SM) is not able to explain the asymmetry by itself, this
observation is a clear indication for the existence of new physics [2–10]. While
diﬀerent ideas exist to create such an asymmetry (e.g. electroweak baryogenesis [11–
16], Aﬄeck-Dine mechanism [17, 18], etc.), the most popular scenario is baryogenesis
via leptogenesis [19, 20], as it allows one to address additionally open questions of
neutrino physics like the underlying mechanism of neutrino mass generation and
mixing.

While the SM charged fermions can only acquire Dirac masses, as they carry
charges of the unbroken electromagnetic/color groups, the SM neutrinos νL, being
electric and color charge neutral, can lead another type of masses,a

with the ﬂavor index being suppressed. This was pointed out for the ﬁrst time by
Ettore Majorana. The Majorana mass term can be described by the dimension-5
Weinberg operator [21, 22]

where y is some dimensionless coupling and Λseesaw is the seesaw scale at which new
degrees of freedom set in. There are three possible ultraviolet completions of the
Weinberg operator at tree-level, known as type I, type II and type III seesaw. The
respective new degrees of freedom are singlet fermions, SU (2)L triplet scalars and
SU (2)L triplet fermions.

(1) leptogenesis from out-of-equilibrium decays.

In order to feature small
enough neutrino masses and at the same time a large enough baryon asym-
metry, the right handed (RH) neutrino mass is constrained. This was ﬁrstly
discussed in [23] in the context of type I seesaw and is known as Davidson-
Ibarra bound. For thermal production, the heavy neutrino mass is bounded
from below as

with m3 being the heaviest of the SM neutrinos. While this bound holds
for vanilla seesaw models, it does not apply to the inverse seesaw model or
radiative neutrino mass generation. However, the tight connection of the
CP-violating decays with the washout processes, forces the heavy neutrino
mass to similar high values in order to achieve successful baryogenesis. Due
to this, the vanilla seesaw scenarios as mechanism behind leptogenesis are
diﬃcult to probe. These problems (and possible solutions) will be discussed
in more detail in Sec. 3. The main features of the thermal leptogenesis
scenario including its possible connection to CP violation in the lepton
sector are reviewed in the accompanying chapters of this review [24–26].

In the following sections, we will discuss models which lead to successful
leptogenesis and can be tested for at diﬀerent experiments. In Sec. 4, seesaw
models with additional new matter ﬁelds will be addressed. Seesaw models
with an extended gauge sector will be considered in Sec. 5. Testability of
leptogenesis in the supersymmetric context will be discussed in Sec. 6. If
the energy scale of the new physics is too high to be tested, possibilities
to falsify high-scale models exist. A model independent approach will be
outlined in Sec. 7.

Besides leptogenesis from out-of-equilibrium decays, another approach

exists, namely

(2) leptogenesis from oscillations. This scenario is also called Akhmedov-
Rubakov-Smirnov (ARS) mechanism, being ﬁrstly discussed in Ref. [27].
In this approach, Yukawa couplings have to be small and feature a certain
hierarchy such that at least one of the sterile neutrinos does not reach ther-
mal equilibrium until the critical temperature of sphaleron decoupling (tc),
whereas at least another one thermally equilibrates before tc. While the
total lepton number is approximately conserved, ﬂavor oscillations create
an asymmetry in between the diﬀerent ﬂavor sectors. The singlets that
are in thermal equilibrium are able to transfer their asymmetry to the ac-
tive neutrino sector before sphaleron decoupling and thus create a baryon
asymmetry. The ones having not reached thermal equilibrium before tc will
have, however, no eﬀect on the ﬁnal baryon asymmetry as they translate
their asymmetry only after sphaleron decoupling. For further details on this
setup, we refer to [28]. With respect to testability, this scenario is highly

interesting. As the Yukawa couplings are generally small, heavy neutrinos
with much smaller masses, i.e. around the GeV scale, are allowed

This opens up a plethora of possible experimental tests, which will be the
topic of the following Sec. 2.

2. Testability of GeV-scale leptogenesis

−

≥

In chapter [28] we have reviewed the Akhmedov-Rubakov-Smirnov mechanism of
leptogenesis in the context of the type I seesaw model at low scales, i.e. for Majorana
neutrino masses between 0.1
100 GeV. We have seen that the type I seesaw model
in Eq. (5) can explain neutrino masses provided that a number of Majorana singlets
n
2 is added to the SM. In spite of being a relatively mild extension of the
SM, these models add an enormous complexity to the lepton ﬂavor sector, which
increases rapidly with n. The type I seesaw model with n = 2 involves four mixing
angles, four mass eigenstates and three CP phases. The model with n = 3 instead
involves six angles as well as six masses and six CP phases. However, at present
only two mass diﬀerences and three angles have been determined (see [26] for a
summary of the current status of data on neutrino masses and lepton mixing).

The ﬂavor complexity opens up in full blossom when considering observables
such as the baryon asymmetry. For the n = 2 model, for example, it has been
shown that this observable is sensitive to all ﬂavor parameters of the lepton sector
[29–32]. The question is therefore, whether there is any hope that all these ﬂavor
parameters can be determined experimentally, at least in principle, and thus the
baryon asymmetry predicted.

A number of experiments will explore the lepton ﬂavor sector with more accuracy
in the future. Particularly important to test the ARS leptogenesis scenario will be
the following experiments:

Neutrino oscillation experiments
These experiments will search for leptonic CP violation in light neutrino
mixing. The oscillation probabilities are sensitive to the light neutrino mix-
ing angles, mass diﬀerences and the CP phase, δ, of the PMNS matrix, see
Eq. 2 in [26]. Although existing accelerator neutrino experiments such as
T2K [33] and NOνA [34], as well as atmospheric neutrino experiments,
are sensitive to δ, this sensitivity is rather limited and will be improved
signiﬁcantly in the future with the experiments DUNE [35] and Hyper-
Kamiokande [36]. For a maximal CP phase, they could measure the phase
δ with

0.17 rad accuracy.

Neutrinoless double beta (0νββ) decay searches

7

This measurement is very sensitive to low-scale seesaw scenarios [37–41],
as the heavy neutrinos can give a signiﬁcant contribution to the amplitude
for masses below 1 GeV. Besides, the light neutrino contribution to this
amplitude is very sensitive to the CP phases of the PMNS matrix, in par-
ticular the Majorana phases that decouple from neutrino oscillations, but
nevertheless are relevant for the baryon asymmetry. For a review of current
and future searches of 0νββ decay we refer to [26].

•

Future direct searches for neutral heavy leptons
Experiments such as SHiP [42, 43] or high intensity e+e− colliders [44–46]
will improve signiﬁcantly the sensitivity to neutral heavy leptons in the
range of masses relevant for ARS leptogenesis. If neutral heavy leptons are
discovered and their masses and mixings to the diﬀerent ﬂavors measured,
these observables provide very useful information on CP phases and other
ﬂavor parameters.

In the next section we will show that in the context of the minimal model with
n = 2, these three inputs might suﬃce to actually predict the baryon asymmetry if
the Majorana masses lie in the GeV range.

Other phenomenological implications of seesaw models include lepton ﬂavor vio-
lating processes, such as µ
e conversion in nuclei [47–49], lepton
3e or µ
electric dipole moments [50–52], electroweak corrections [53–58], or CP-violating
meson decays as will be covered in Sec. 2.4. Any such measurement could of course
add very valuable information on the ﬂavor parameters, but it is unlikely that the
parameter space relevant for successful baryogenesis will give measurable contri-
butions to these observables in the near future, since typically this would require
larger mixings.

2.1. Testing the minimal seesaw model at the GeV-scale

In the following, we constrain ourselves to the n = 2 type I seesaw model, the
simplest extension of the SM that can explain neutrino masses. A convenient pa-
rameterization of the Yukawa matrix in the Lagrangian Eq. (5) is given by the
Casas-Ibarra parameterization (adapted to the case of n = 2) [59]:

This parameterization assumes that non-unitarity eﬀects are suﬃciently small,
which is a good approximation in the mass range relevant for leptogenesis, given
the existing constraints reviewed in the following Sec. 2.3.

It is important to stress that the model with n = 2 is also a good representation
of the model with n
3 in which one of the states is very weakly coupled and
eﬀectively decouples from the physics relevant in baryogenesis. This happens e.g.
in the νMSM [60], where the almost-decoupled state could play the role of warm
dark matter. The realization of leptogenesis in this minimal model, which is, in
practice, equivalent to the νMSM, has been studied by many authors. As the
mechanism has been described in detail in [28], we refer to that chapter for a full
list of references.

In a recent work, the Bayesian posterior probabilities from a successful prediction
of the baryon asymmetry have been evaluated [32]. The results for the heavy state
2 with α = τ, µ, e versus the mass M1 is reproduced in Fig. 1 for normal
mixing
(left) and inverted (right) hierarchy. The result for the 0νββ decay amplitude mββ
versus the mass degeneracy ∆M12/M1 is shown in Fig. 2. The blue/red regions
,
M1|
correspond to considering ﬂat priors in log10 M1 and log10 M2/log10 |
respectively. Thus, the red regions allow for larger tuning in the degeneracy of the
masses. Interestingly, the less tuned blue regions are within the reach of SHiP, and
seem to be correlated with a sizeable non-standard contribution to the amplitude
of 0νββ decay, see Fig. 2. This has been observed as well in other studies [61, 62].
On general grounds, we expect that, in the weak washout regime, where a per-
turbative expansion in Yukawas is a good approximation, the baryon asymmetry is
proportional to the most general weak-basis invariant:

maximal atmospheric mixing. We see that for both neutrino hierarchies, the baryon
asymmetry depends on all ﬂavor parameters of the model: the light neutrino masses
and mixings, the heavy neutrino masses, as well as the real and imaginary part of
the Casas-Ibarra complex angle θ, γ. A very important question is how many of
these parameters could be measured in the future experiments listed above, at least
in principle.

Future searches for heavy neutral leptons in the GeV range are obviously most
promising.
Ideally, such experiments could discover the two heavy states of the
minimal model, measure their splitting, and their mixings to individual SM ﬂavors.

muon ﬂavor depends only on the light neutrino masses and the PMNS mixing angles
and phases. In particular it depends on the two unknown CP phases: δ which can
be determined in future neutrino oscillation experiments and the Majorana phase
φ1, that modiﬁes the amplitude for 0νββ decay. A recent study [63] has evaluated
the sensitivity of this observable to leptonic CP violation.

Note that there is no dependence at this order on the angle θ and therefore
the measurement of the mixings and masses of the heavy states does not provide
suﬃcient information to predict the baryon asymmetry. There is always a choice of
θ for which the asymmetry vanishes in this approximation.

There is, however, what could be called a GeV-miracle: the heavy states in
this mass range can give non-standard contributions to 0νββ decay, as we have
seen in the posterior probabilities in Fig. 2. Interestingly, the angle θ controls the
interference between the light and heavy contributions to this observable. In the (cid:15)

As a proof of principle, we have considered the model indicated by the star
in Fig. 1, corresponding to an inverted neutrino hierarchy. Assuming a putative
measurement of the two heavy states at SHiP, with M1, M2 determined with a
0.1% accuracy, and their mixings to electrons and muons with a 1% accuracy, the
Bayesian posterior probabilities in the plane (Y∆B,
) are shown in Fig. 3. The
red contour corresponds to a measurement of SHiP only, while the blue includes the
assumption that the phase δ is determined in future neutrino oscillation experiments
with a 0.17 rad accuracy [35]. The latter measurement is very important, because it
resolves the (δ, φ1) correlation in the mixings. The shape of the blue contour can be
understood as resulting from this correlation [32]. Depending on the measurement
of 0νββ decay, the baryon asymmetry might be predicted up to a sign.

This exercise clearly demonstrates the synergy of the diﬀerent experimental tests
of this minimal model: long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, 0νββ decay
and direct searches of neutral heavy leptons, are optimal for probing the GeV range,
where a prediction of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe might be
achievable.

to the relation Eq. (6) and the fact that the light neutrino masses are very small.
If we neglect the matrix structure of Eq. (6), i.e., pretend to live in a world with
only one generation of SM particles and one ﬂavour of heavy neutrinos, then the
magnitude of the Majorana mass MN uniquely ﬁxes the size of the Yukawa coupling
as λ2 = 2MN mν/v2. When the matrices MN and λ have no special structure, then
one would expect a similar scaling for their eigenvalues. In this case we can estimate

In this scenario,

smallness of the light neutrino mi is primarily a result of the smallness of (cid:15) and

1 typically establish relations between these
parameters, i.e., specify a trajectory in the (cid:15)-µ plane along which the limit µ, (cid:15)

nothing but a manifestation of the fact that the B

the model building and treat (cid:15) and µ as independent parameters. In the following

2.2.1. Leptogenesis with large mixing angles

(cid:28)

The limit µ, (cid:15)
1 is interesting for two diﬀerent reasons. First, it allows to realize
large active-sterile mixing angles while respecting constraints from light neutrino
oscillation data. Second, it allows for at least three mechanisms of low-scale lepto-
genesis in the minimal model, see (5).
cOne may consider it questionable that the name “seesaw” is appropriate for scenarios with
MN /v (cid:38) 1. However, it is common to refer to the Lagrangian (5) with the parameter choice
Mi < TeV as low-scale seesaw.

15

130 GeV [69].

(a) For Mi above the electroweak scale, the baryon asymmetry can be generated
in the decay of Ni via resonant leptogenesis [68]. The lower bound on the
mass comes from the requirement that the heavy neutrinos freeze out and
decay before sphalerons freeze out at TEWsp ∼

(b) For smaller masses Mi, the baryon asymmetry can be produced in the
decay of Higgs bosons into heavy neutrinos and SM leptons. This decay
is kinematically possible in the symmetric phase of the SM due to the
“thermal masses” that (quasi)particles obtain from forward scatterings in
the primordial plasma. Both, the Higgs bosons and the SM leptons receive a
thermal mass of equal size due to their gauge interactions. The Higgs boson
receives an additional contribution to its thermal mass from the couplings
to fermions (primarily the top quark) and its self-interaction, which makes
the 1
2 decay into a SM lepton (cid:96)a and a heavy neutrino Ni kinematically
possible. This kinematic possibility was already realized in Ref. [70] and
brieﬂy discussed in Ref. [71] (cf. also Ref. [72] in the context of sterile
neutrino Dark Matter production). In Refs. [73, 74] it has been pointed
out that it opens a new channel for low-scale leptogenesis. In addition to
the decays and inverse decays considered in Ref. [73], scatterings may play
an important role for total lepton number violation. This is known to be
the case for purely ﬂavor violating processes [75, 76], see Refs. [77–79].
(c) For Mi below the electroweak scale, the baryon asymmetry may also be
generated via CP-violating oscillations of the heavy neutrinos during their
production (instead of their decay) [27, 60]. This mechanism of leptogenesis
from neutrino oscillations is reviewed in detail in [28].

in the νMSM [29]. The parametric dependence of the baryon asymmetry on the
model parameters is in general non-polynomial. A detailed discussion can be found
in Ref. [83] and in [28].

∼

The 1/(cid:15) enhancement of one eigenvalue of λ†λ also implies that successful lepto-
genesis is possible for much larger mixing angles Uαi than in the oscillatory regime.
This can be seen by comparing Figure 1 and Figure 4. Note that, in contrast to
Fig. 1, the upper limits on the mixings in Fig. 4 are the maximum values found
compatible with leptogenesis. Instead, Fig. 1 shows the most probable regions (at
90%CL) in a Bayesian analysis that assumes a ﬂat measure in the chosen param-
eter space. Even though this measure does not disfavor the symmetry protected
scenario, it does not favor it either. In contrast to the contours in Fig. 1, the lines
in Fig. 4 do not correspond to Bayesian likelihoods, but simply show the boundaries
of the viable parameter region if one remains entirely agnostic about the values of
the heavy neutrino parameters (in particular (cid:15) and µ) and the unknown phases
δ and α in the light neutrino mixing matrix Uν. Here δ is the Dirac phase and
α the Majorana phase, see [28]. These results were obtained from the ﬂavored
source alone; total lepton number violating processes should be included in further
studies [46, 84, 85].

2.2.2. Testability

From a viewpoint of testabilityg the symmetry protected scenario is very attractive
because the 1/(cid:15) enhancement of the Yukawa coupling allows for larger mixing angles
and hence larger branching ratios in experiments. The quantities that determine the
2. The overall interaction
branching ratios in experiments are the mixing angles
strength of the heavy neutrinos can be characterized by the quantity U 2 = tr(U †U ),
which can be expressed in terms of the model parameters by Eq. (25) without any
approximations, which clearly shows the enhancement for small (cid:15).

Uαi|

To relate the dynamics during leptogenesis to the behavior in the laboratory,
we have to relate the heavy neutrino interaction eigenstates (i.e., the ﬂavor eigen-
vectors of the matrix ΓN = λ†λγavT ) to the physical mass states. In the very early
Universe, the eﬀective heavy neutrino masses are dominated by the thermal masses
λ†λT . Hence, ΓN and the eﬀective mass matrix are both proportional to the ma-
∝
trix λ†λ and can be diagonalized simultaneously, so that the Ni mass and interaction
eigenstates are identical. As the temperature drops, the contribution from MN to
their eﬀective mass becomes increasingly important, and the gradual decrease of the

gBy “testability” we here mean the potential to actually discover the heavy neutrinos in near
future experiments, which requires that their masses are below the TeV-scale. The potential to
indirectly rule out leptogenesis with larger Mi has been studied in Refs. [98, 99], cf. Sec. 7.

asymmetry and compare it to the observed value. The parameter space can even
be over-constrained if measurements of indirect observables that are sensitive to
the heavy neutrino properties are added, such as 0νββ decay, lepton universality
violation or searches for CP-violation in the heavy neutrino decay (cf. Sec. 2.3). This
at least in principle makes the low-scale seesaw a fully testable model of neutrino
masses and baryogenesis [86].

However, in practice it may be diﬃcult to determine all parameters with suﬃ-
cient accuracy to reliably predict the baryon asymmetry. In particular, it will be
very diﬃcult to resolve the heavy neutrino mass splitting ∆M , which strongly aﬀects
the baryon asymmetry, at SHiP or future lepton collider if it is smaller than about
10 MeV.j For the tiny mass splittings in the overdamped regime this is certainly

As a result, one cannot put constraints on the two parameters ∆M and θ, both of
which are crucial for leptogenesis, if µ is very small. In spite of this, consistency
checks for both, the hypothesis that the Ni generate the light neutrino masses via
the seesaw mechanism and the BAU via leptogenesis, are still possible [32, 86]. In
the approximation µ = 0, a measurement of all U 2
α allows to uniquely ﬁx (cid:15), cf.
Eq. (25). The relative sizes of the U 2
α are then entirely determined by the phases α

and δ alone. Since not every set (U 2
τ ) can be realized by varying (α, δ, γ),
see Fig. 5, the consistency of the U 2
α measurements with each other and with a
possible determination of δ in neutrino oscillation experiments allow to rule out or
support the minimal model with n = 2. Moreover, for large U 2, leptogenesis re-
quires U 2
1 for at least one ﬂavor in order to prevent a complete washout of
the asymmetries before sphaleron freeze-out. This means that the requirement for
successful leptogenesis allows to make additional predictions for the allowed range
of U 2

α/U 2, cf. Fig. 5, which can be used as a test for leptogenesis.
Finally, it has been pointed out in Refs. [32, 111] that one may turn the tables
and use the U 2
α measured in heavy neutrino decays at SHiP or a future collider to
constrain the phases in Uν, in particular the Majorana phase α, which is hard (if
not impossible) to detect in light neutrino experiments.

indirect probe of heavy neutrino properties, their masses cannot be constrained
from the relation (6) alone for two reasons:

(1) If one assumes that MN and λ have no special structure, then the relation

(6) predicts MN ∼
is, any value of Mi can be made consistent with the constraints on the light
neutrino mass matrix Mν by adjusting λ.

(2) There is even more freedom if we make use of the full matrix structure
of equation (6). What is experimentally constrained to be small are the
eigenvalues m2
i of MνM †ν , not the individual entries of the matrix Mν. For
example, in the symmetry protected scenario described in Sec. 2.2, rather
large individual entries can be made consistent with small mi in a natural
way if the parameters µ and (cid:15) deﬁned in Eq. (23) are chosen small.

Hence, the range of masses allowed by neutrino oscillation data in principle is very
large and reaches from the eV-scale [115] up to values above the suspected scale
of grand uniﬁcation.m We in the following restrict the discussion to the parameter
region in which the heavy neutrinos that generate the baryon asymmetry can be
found in existing or proposed experiments. This eﬀectively restricts us to masses Mi
below the electroweak scale.n A more general discussion of right handed neutrinos
with various diﬀerent masses and their role in particle physics and cosmology can
e.g. be found in the review [117].

In addition, they may have other (new physics) interactions that we do not discuss
here because they are model dependent. A popular choice are e.g. SU(2) gauge
interactions in left-right symmetric theories, which are e.g. discussed in Ref. [118]
and references therein. It is instructive to classify the experimental signatures in two
qualitatively diﬀerent categories. In direct searches the Ni appear as real particles
and can therefore be discovered. In contrast to that, we refer to experiments that
are indirectly aﬀected by the heavy neutrinos as indirect searches; this usually
primarily happens via the modiﬁcation of the light neutrino interactions due to the
non-unitarity in (31).

mA theoretical upper bound can be imposed if one requires that their Yukawa interactions can
be described by perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory; then their masses Mi should be at least 1-2
orders of magnitude below the Planck mass [116].
nHeavier Ni can of course in principle be produced at the LHC or future colliders, but the produc-
tion rates are much smaller than those in weak gauge boson decays, and it is currently not clear
whether searches can enter the range of

Depending on their mass, heavy neutrinos are predominantly produced in meson
decays (Mi < 5 GeV), real weak gauge boson decays (5 GeV < Mi < 80 GeV
or exchange of virtual weak gauge bosons (80 GeV < Mi).o Being neutral, the
Ni themselves do not leave any trace in the detector and can only be observed
by studying the kinematics of the charged particles that are produced along with
them and when they decay into charged particles. The best search strategy strongly
depends on their mass because their lifetime scales as

[42].

Heavy neutrinos that are light enough to be produced in meson decays can be so
long lived that the number of Ni-decays within conventional detectors at colliders is
very small. They can, however, be observed in ﬁxed target experiments if one places
a detector behind the target. Past beam dump experiments include PS191 [126],
NuTeV [127], CHARM [128], CHARM and CHARM II [129], NA3 [130], E949 [131],
IHEP-JINR [132], BEBC [133], FMMF [134] and NOMAD [135]. The NA62 ex-
periment has performed peak searches [136] and will perform a dedicated search
for heavy neutrinos in dump mode (“SHADOWS run”). In the next decade, the
proposed SHiP [43, 137, 138] experiment could improve the existing constraints by
several orders of magnitude [88]. For very small masses even ﬁxed target experi-
ments are limited by the length of their detector. However, the heavy neutrinos
may still reveal their existence because their on-shell production causes a peak in
the spectrum or charged leptons emitted in meson decays. Peak searches have been
performed using kaons and pions as initial mesons [139–146]. For larger masses of a
few GeV, the experiments BELLE [147] LHCb [148]p have looked for lepton number
violation in meson decays, which can be mediated by heavy neutrinos. LHCb has
also looked for displaced vertices [150]. The interesting possibility to look for CP
violation in meson decays mediated by heavy neutrinos is discussed in Sec. 2.4.

Heavy neutrinos with larger masses have been searched for by the experiments
DELPHI [151], L3 [152, 153], ATLAS [154] and CMS [155–157]. The LHC searches
have so far been focused on lepton number violating signals, such as same sign
di-leptons in the ﬁnal state. These are probably the most promising signals if
the heavy neutrinos decay promptly and have been studied by a large number of
authors (see e.g. Refs. [118, 158] for a partial list of references). However, if the Ni
are lighter than the W boson, they may be long lived enough to be observed by the
displacement between their production and decay. How light exactly they have to be
depends on the experiment. Displaced vertex searches are more powerful at masses
below roughly 20-30 GeV at ATLAS and CMS [95–97] or LHCb [94]. Based on the
current estimates, none of these experiments can reach deeply in the leptogenesis
region for n = 2 (though at least LHCb may touch it in the high luminosity run
of the LHC). An upgrade of the MATHUSLA-type [159] could enable the LHC to

probe at least part of the leptogenesis region. For n > 3 the leptogenesis region is
larger and may be accessed by current LHC experiments or BELLE II [112].q The
perspectives to search for heavy neutrinos are certainly much better at a future
high energy collider. They have been studied by a number of authors, see e.g. [118]
for a partial list of references. A recent summary of signatures at diﬀerent types of
colliders can be found in Ref. [160]. In Ref. [46] the potential of future colliders to
probe low-scale leptogenesis has been studied speciﬁcally.

The results from diﬀerent past searches are shown in Fig. 6.

In Fig. 4 we
compare the sensitivity of diﬀerent planned or proposed direct searches to the viable
leptogenesis parameter region for n = 2.

2.3.2. Indirect Searches

The properties of heavy neutrinos are not only constrained by the negative result of
direct searches for them, but also by searches for deviations from the SM predictions
in precision observables and rare processes. These are primarily sensitive to the
properties of the Ni because they modify the weak interactions of the SM leptons
in Eq. (32). Various processes have been studied by a large number of diﬀerent
authors. A (possibly incomplete) list can e.g. be found in Refs. [158, 162, 165–167],
along with a (certainly incomplete) list of references. The most important ones in
the parameter regime considered here are

Neutrino oscillation data - The strongest indirect constraints on Ni proper-
ties come from neutrino oscillation data. The requirement to generate the
observed light neutrino masses imposes a mass dependent lower bound on
U 2, which provides a “bottom line” for experimental searches. The physi-
cal reason is that the right handed neutrinos cannot give mass to the SM
neutrinos if they do not interact with them. For n = 2 this requirement also
imposes a lower bound on the individual U 2
α [104, 105], which can be seen
in Fig. 4. The lower bound is considerably weaker for n > 2 [158, 168]. In
addition, neutrino oscillation data also constrains the relative size U 2
α/U 2 of
the heavy neutrino couplings to individual SM ﬂavours, cf. Fig. 5. The use
of the Casas-Ibarra parameterization (9) automatically ensures consistency
with neutrino oscillation data constraints at tree level. For mixing angles
much larger than the ”naive seesaw estimate” (22), loop corrections may
be not negligible. They can be included by using the radiatively corrected

qThe results presented in Ref. [112] should be treated with some care because the authors did
2
not take the fast equilibration of some heavy neutrino interaction eigenstates in the large
regime into account consistently. However, the main observation made in this paper is that the
constraints from neutrino oscillation data allow for larger hierarchies amongst the Ni couplings
to individual SM ﬂavors (i.e., smaller U 2
α/U 2) for n > 2, as compared to the minimal model with
n = 2. This allows to protect part of the asymmetries from washout even if some heavy neutrino
interaction eigenstates have reached equilibrium. Hence, the conclusion that leptogenesis can be

equilibration.

1 is a
necessary requirement for leptogenesis. For n = 3, no mass degeneracy is
required [80], and a large mββ can easily be realized within the leptogenesis
parameter region [61]. Moreover, even in the model with n = 2, there exists
a corner in the parameter space in which the observed baryon asymmetry
can be reproduced while the term
µ/(cid:15) in mββ dominates [32, 61, 62]. A
part of this region that is not constrained by any other experiment has been
ruled out by the constraints from GERDA [170] and KAMLAND-Zen [171]
experiments, making them the strongest constraint on Ni properties in
this regime [61]. Possibly even more importantly, this allows to constrain
the parameter θ even if µ is so small that direct searches cannot kine-
matically distinguish the two heavy neutrinos, at least in the region where
Λ/ ¯M > 0.1 [32, 86].

All other indirect constraints are currently not sensitive to the small mixing angles
required for leptogenesis. For completeness, we shall nevertheless mention the most
important observables that can constrain the low-scale seesaw model with Mi below
the TeV-scale, even though most of these are very far from being able to constrain
the parameter region where low-scale leptogenesis is possible.

Lepton universality - The existence of heavy neutrinos violates the univer-
sality of the strength at which diﬀerent SM neutrinos couple to the weak
interaction. This e.g. leads to deviations of the relative size of the branch-
ing ratios at which mesons decay into muon and electron ﬁnal states. If
one tries to explain the observed data within the minimal seesaw model,
the best ﬁt value actually suggests U 2
= 0 [166]. However, the signiﬁcance
e (cid:54)
of this preference is rather low, and it would be diﬃcult to make this result
consistent with other observables.
CKM unitarity - The CKM matrix is unitary in the minimal seesaw model.
However, its elements are experimentally determined from processes involv-
ing leptons, whose branching ratios are modiﬁed by the eﬀect of the heavy

the eﬀect of the non-unitarity in the light neutrino mixing matrix Uν. The
constraints from CKM data are currently sub-dominant, but almost sat-

entire mass range considered [158].
Electroweak precision data - The modiﬁcation of the weak currents (32)
also aﬀects the relations between the weak gauge boson masses, the Wein-
berg angle, the observed Fermi constant and the ﬁne structure constant at
the Z pole. These relations are measured with high precision. In Ref. [55]
it was reported that data provides tentative evidence for the existence of
TeV-scale heavy neutrinos. In most of the mass range below the W boson
we consider here, the constraints from electroweak precision data are sub-
dominant compared to direct searches. Also observations of the invisible
Z decay width are not sensitive to heavy neutrinos that are much lighter
than the Z boson because, as a result of the unitarity of the total (light and
heavy) neutrino mixing matrix or “GIM suppression”, the additional decay
channels into Ni are exactly compensated by a reduction of the decay am-

Leptogenesis from neutrino oscillations in principle can generate the observed
baryon asymmetry for Mi as small as 10 MeV [30, 31, 174]. However, such small
masses are strongly disfavored in the context of the seesaw mechanism because they
lead to Ni lifetimes that are long enough that their decay in the early Universe dis-
turbs Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) [175, 176] unless their mixing angles are
very large. More precisely, the requirement to decay before nucleosynthesis imposes
a lower bound on U 2
2 for given Mi, which becomes stronger than the
lower bound from neutrino oscillation data for Mi below a few hundred MeV. The
exact point where the bound from nucleosynthesis becomes stronger depends on the
ﬂavor structure and neutrino mass hierarchy. Combining these consideration with
the negative result of various past experimental searches [86, 104, 158, 162], one
ﬁnds that the lower bound on Mi is roughly 100 MeV [105, 177, 178] in the minimal
model with n = 2. To reach this conclusion, one has to bear in mind that right
handed neutrinos that decay after BBN leave an imprint in the eﬀective number
of relativistic degrees of freedom Neﬀ , either because they are relativistic during
BBN or because their decay disturbs the phase space distribution of SM particles
at later times, which would have a similar eﬀect on the properties of temperature
ﬂuctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background as extra relativistic particles. A
more careful analysis reveals that this conclusion can be avoided for some of the
heavy neutrinos for n > 2 [178]. However, the states with masses below 100 MeV
are required to have very feeble mixing angles Uαi in order to avoid thermalization
in the early Universe. While this opens up the interesting possibility that these
particle compose the Dark Matter [179, 180], which is e.g. realized in the Neutrino
Minimal Standard Model (νMSM) [60, 181] (see Ref. [182] for a review), it means
that the contribution of these states to the seesaw mechanism and to leptogenesis is
negligible. We will therefore not further discuss this case and only consider masses
Mi > 100 MeV. For a recent review of the sterile neutrino DM scenario, we refer
the interested reader to Ref. [183]. Leptogenesis does not provide an upper bound
on the magnitude of the Mi, but heavy neutrinos with masses heavier than a few

30

hundred GeV cannot be produced in sizable numbers at any existing experiment.

2.3.4. Global Constraints

Within a given model, it is possible to obtain “global constraints” on the properties
of the heavy neutrinos by combining the various observables mentioned above. Var-
ious authors have done this under diﬀerent assumptions about the data sets that
should be included, the number n of heavy neutrinos, the mass mlightest of the light-
est neutrinos and the validity of cosmological constraints (which obviously depend
on at least moderate assumptions about the thermal history of the universe) [31,
38, 41, 52, 57, 58, 61, 86, 104, 105, 117, 118, 158, 162, 165–167, 174, 178, 184–195].
Most of these eﬀorts have been focused on the minimal model with n = 2, where
the number of free parameter is rather low and the combination of diﬀerent bounds
imposes considerably stronger constraints than simply superimposing them in the
MN -U 2
α plane. The gray area in Fig. 4 corresponds to the global constraints for
n = 2 as reported in Ref. [86]. It is shown along with the minimal and maximal
U 2
In Ref. [158] a similar analysis has
been performed for n = 3. The leptogenesis parameter space has not been explored
systematically for n = 3 to date.

of B± and B±c .

3. General mechanisms for low scale leptogenesis from out-of-

equilibrium decays

After focusing on probing GeV-scale leptogenesis via oscillations, we want to review
the testability of leptogenesis from out-of-equilibrium decays. As already described
in Sec. 1, in the latter type of leptogenesis an asymmetry is created by L-violating
out-of-equilibrium decays of new heavy degrees of freedom X that provide a new
source of CP violation via loop eﬀects. As long as these decays generate a net
asymmetry above the electroweak scale, when electroweak sphalerons are in thermal
equilibrium, baryogenesis via leptogenesis [19] becomes possible. For more detailed
reviews about leptogenesis from out-of-equilibrium decays, the reader is referred to
Refs. [20, 204–207] and references therein.

Before addressing the possibility of probing speciﬁc models, we review in this
section the main diﬃculties which arise in order to achieve thermal baryogenesis
from heavy particle decays at low temperatures (around or below the TeV scale)
and brieﬂy explain the three known mechanisms to avoid the most crucial one. Let
us note that the discussion also applies to baryogenesis from particle annihilations.
Thermal baryogenesis from particle decays or annihilations at low energy scales

faces two main problems:

(a) Small neutrino masses. The CP violation relevant for baryogenesis is pa-
rameterized by the CP asymmetry (cid:15) per decay (or annihilation) of heavy
particles. In some leptogenesis models (cid:15) is proportional to the masses of
both, the light (mostly active) neutrinos and the heavy ones. Given the
tiny value of light neutrino masses (compared to the electroweak scale), the
leptogenesis scale set by the mass of the heavy neutrinos has to be very
high in order to generate a large enough lepton asymmetry. Let us study
this in more detail, considering the vanilla mechanisms of type I, type II,
and type III seesaw, where the respective new degrees of freedom are singlet
fermions, SU (2)L triplet scalars and SU (2)L triplet fermions, respectively.

This back-of-the-envelope estimation [208–211] agrees with the exact
bound ﬁrstly derived by Davidson and Ibarra in the context of type I lepto-
genesis, cp. (7) [23]. The main diﬀerence between type I compared to type
II and III leptogenesis is that the heavy degrees of freedom in the former
are singlet under SU (2)L, while those for the latter two are triplets and
hence they will be maintained close to thermal equilibrium by gauge inter-
actions. Nevertheless, the bound obtained in these models does not diﬀer
very much from the estimation in Eq. (40). For a more detailed discussion
the reader is referred to Sec. 4.2 and the reviews [212, 213]. The bound
on the mass of the new heavy degree of freedom, can be relaxed if lepton
ﬂavor eﬀects [208, 214–216] are taken into account. In the context of type
I leptogenesis, it was shown in Ref. [217] that the bound can be lowered to
106 GeV.

Although present in well motivated scenarios, this problem is not generic
and does not arise in neutrino mass models like the inverse seesaw or the
radiative ones.

(b) Interplay between CP asymmetry and washout. This problem is intrinsic to
all models for thermal baryogenesis from particle decays (or annihilations).
In order to generate a CP asymmetry, both a CP odd and a CP even
phase are required. The former comes from complex couplings while the
latter from the absorptive parts of one-loop contributions to the decay pro-
cesses, which are always proportional to the amplitude of B or L-violating
scatterings [218], as depicted in Fig. 9. Therefore the size of the CP asym-
metry is tied to the strength of processes capable of erasing the asymmetry

34

Fig. 9. At leading order the CP asymmetry in N1 decays arises from the interference of tree-
level and one-loop diagrams (upper part). The vertical cuts through the loops point out that the
propagating particles can go on shell -a requisite for having CP even phases-. This entails the
existence of L-violating processes, which might be very eﬃcient at erasing the lepton asymmetry
(lower part). Here the inert doublet model with sterile neutrinos has been used as an example.

when they are faster than the expansion rate of the Universe H. Given
T 2/MPl), it is diﬃcult to
that H decreases with the temperature T (H
have both, small washout and large CP asymmetries (see Fig. 10) when
the baryogenesis scale is very low relative to MPl. In this review, this is-
sue will be discussed more speciﬁcally in Sec. 4.1.1, taking an extension to
type I seesaw as an example. In [219], the tight connection between CP
asymmetry and washout was discussed extensively within the Inert Doublet
Model (IDM) with singlet neutrinos [220],s which circumvents problem (a)
by having radiatively generated neutrino masses. The lower limit on the
heavy neutrino mass was found to be M1 (cid:38)
TeV when none of the
low scale mechanisms for baryogenesis explained next are incorporated. As
discussed in [219], this bound is arguably quite model independent, e.g. it
is similar within an order of magnitude in the inverse seesaw model [217]
and for cloistered baryogenesis discussed in Sec. 4.1.1.

In order to allow for leptogenesis at or below the TeV scale, the aforementioned
two problems have to be addressed. In the following we would like to discuss the
three known ways to avoid problem (b), which is the one common to all scenarios
of thermal baryogenesis from particle decays or annihilations:

•

Almost degenerate particles: In case of decaying particles almost degenerate
in mass, the CP asymmetry can be enhanced up to O(1) values [222–224].
As an example, let us consider two sterile neutrinos Nk (k = 1, 2), with
masses Mk, Yukawa couplings λαk, and decay widths Γk. When the reso-

masses Mk. The new ﬁelds are odd under a conserved Z2 discrete symmetry.

H(T =M1) constant for all M1 (with Γ1 being the N1 decay width). It is
in order to keep (cid:15)1 and
apparent that for M1 (cid:46) 107 GeV, YB falls exponentially as M1 decreases. However if the washout
is omitted, as sometimes done -wrongly- in the literature, the baryon asymmetry only decreases
linearly and its value at the TeV scale is many orders of magnitude above the true one. This ﬁgure
has been taken from Ref. [221].

processes can be diminished by choosing small values of (λ†λ)22, while
compensating the associated decrease in (cid:15)1 with a tiny value for δ.t This
approach, known as “resonant leptogenesis” mechanism is thoroughly dis-
cussed in the accompanying chapter of this review [225].
Late decay: The washout processes inherent to the CP asymmetry in N1
decays have a rate proportional to (T /M2)a for T (cid:46) M2, where a = 2 (4) for
a Majorana (scalar or Dirac) mediator with mass M2. Rising M2 relative to
M1 is not helpful for lowering the baryogenesis scale, since both, washout
and CP asymmetry, decrease by the same amount. Nevertheless, the pre-
vious relation shows that the washout eﬀects can be diminished by letting
N1 decay very late. Two conditions must be fulﬁlled for this “late-decay”
mechanism to be successful:
(1) a small decay width Γ1 (cid:28)

(2) an interaction to populate the Universe with the N1’s which is diﬀerent
from the one inducing the decay (as this one is too weak in order to
fulﬁll (1)), e.g. a new gauge interaction [226, 227]. This interaction
should be eﬀective only at T (cid:38) M1 such that the N1’s disappear via
the CP-violating processes.

•

With this setup, it is possible to achieve TeV-scale leptogenesis (as well as
baryogenesis at much lower scales when the decays violate B, see [219] for
more details).
Massive decay (annihilation) products: In general the washout rate depends
not only on the amplitude of the corresponding process, but also on the
number density of the particles involved. Therefore, if one of these particles
has a mass such that it becomes non-relativistic in the baryogenesis era,
the washout is Boltzmann suppressed. Under the non-trivial conditions
explained next, this mechanism of washout suppression was demonstrated
to enable baryogenesis at the TeV scale from DM annihilation in [228] and
from heavy particle decays later in [219]. It also allows for baryogenesis
well below the electroweak scale if B is violated perturbatively.

For clarity purposes we consider a speciﬁc model, the IDM with sterile
neutrinos heavier than the exotic Higgs doublet φ2. The decays of the
heavy neutrino N1 generate an asymmetry in both, leptons and φ2 (which
plays the role of the massive decay product with mass Mφ2). In turn, the
asymmetries in each of these sectors ((cid:96) and φ2) induce washout of the lepton
asymmetry (e.g. more (cid:96)’s than ¯(cid:96)’s, but also more φ2’s than ¯φ2’s, lead to
(cid:96)φ2). Under kinetic
an increase of the rate of (cid:96)φ2 →

low energy scales persists. Instead, if the asymmetry in φ2 can be erased by
some fast interaction diﬀerent from the one that sources baryogenesis, with
chemical equilibrium implying that Y∆φ2 is Boltzmann suppressed relative
to Y∆(cid:96), then a way opens for thermal baryogenesis at the TeV scale.

These possibilities can be illustrated by one of the terms in the scalar
potential of the IDM, λ5(φ†φ2)2/2. If λ5 = 0 there is a conserved lepton
number (φ2 is assigned L =
1), whereas for large values of λ5, new fast φ2-
depleting interactions exist. With λ5 modeling a non-trivial w2(z), Fig. 11
demonstrates the crucial dependence of the baryon asymmetry on the size
of these interactions.

Diﬀerent ways of implementing consistently heavy decay or annihilation
products in order to achieve baryogenesis at low scales have been developed
in Refs. [228–231]. A more radical approach to avoid the potential prob-
lem related to the asymmetry in the heavy sector is to make a Majorana
fermion play the role of the heavy decay or annihilation product [232]. In
this way there is no asymmetry in the heavy ﬁeld and the aforementioned
problem is completely avoided. An implementation of this idea developed
in [232] is to have baryogenesis from DM annihilation, with the sterile neu-
trinos responsible for the masses of the SM neutrinos playing a key role in
baryogenesis and the freeze-out of DM annihilations.

To conclude, we have summarized the main diﬃculties which have to be over-

come to achieve TeV-scale leptogenesis and discussed the three known mechanisms
which allow to circumvent the main problem common to all models of thermal
baryogenesis from particle decays (or annihilations). In the following sections, we
will discuss their implementation in the context of speciﬁc models giving us the
possibility to probe TeV-scale leptogenesis experimentally.

4. Testability of leptogenesis in extended seesaw models

As we have seen in the previous section, speciﬁc conditions have to be fulﬁlled in
order to obtain TeV-scale leptogenesis. As this is diﬃcult for the “vanilla” see-
saw models, as shown in Eq. (40), we want to concentrate on extensions to these
models which allow for testable scenarios. First, we focus on extensions to the stan-
dard seesaw models by new matter ﬁelds only, without considering any new gauge
interactions.

4.1. Extensions to the type I seesaw model

In type I seesaw, at least two heavy Majorana singlet fermions Nk are introduced,
resulting in the Lagrangian given in Eq. (5). For deﬁniteness, we consider three gen-
erations of RH neutrinos k = 1, 2, 3. As illustrated in the previous section, Eq. (40),
the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino N1 is bounded from below, essentially due

to constraints implied by the light neutrino mass scale.
constraints, we can extend the type I seesaw by coupling Nk to other SM fermions.
The type of new interactions is restricted by gauge invariance such that only new
scalars with the same quantum numbers as SM fermions (generically denoted as ψ)
can be involved [233]:

The cases ˜(cid:96), ˜e, and ˜Q, instead, are viable without additional assumptions. If
these new scalars are around the TeV scale, they could be produced at colliders
in principle. Notice that ˜(cid:96) has the same electroweak quantum numbers as the
SM Higgs doublet and as such, their presence can generally induce ﬂavor-changing-
neutral currents at tree-level [236]. However, experimental limits require that either
˜(cid:96) is very heavy, or that its couplings are very small [237]. A TeV scale ˜e can be
pair produced at the LHC via electroweak processes, while ˜Q (leptoquark) can be
produced with a large rate via QCD processes [238–242]. Their production modes
are discussed in Ref. [233] and will not be discussed further in this review.

From the new interactions, we can also have new contributions to CP violation

In Sec. 4.1.1, we will show that in the case of hierarchical RH neutrinos, the
107 GeV within extended
bound on M1 (cf. Eq. (40)) can be lowered down to
seesaw models. This result does not apply only to extensions to the type I seesaw,
but is valid in general. However, due to the interplay between CP violation and
washout scatterings, leptogenesis with hierarchical RH neutrinos in the TeV range,
as suggested in [233], cannot be reached. The reason, in case of hierarchical RH
neutrinos, is the following: In order keep the washout scatterings under control at
the TeV scale, the amount of CP violation will be too small for successful leptoge-
nesis. When considering, however, a scenario with quasi-degenerate RH neutrinos
and resonantly enhanced CP asymmetries, TeV leptogenesis can still be realized.

∼

In Sec. 4.1.2, we will then discuss cloistered baryogenesis [235] that, as was
already mentioned above, is based on an extension to the type I seesaw with ˜u, where
conservation of baryon number at the perturbative level is imposed. In particular,
we will prove that even in the presence of fast B
L violating interactions, an
asymmetry can still be obtained.

−

4.1.1. The scale for extended type I seesaw baryogenesis

In this section we show that assuming a non degenerate RH neutrino spectrum, we
can derive a lower bound on the temperature that allows for successful baryogen-
esis via leptogenesis, and speciﬁcally also for cloistered baryogenesis. In that case
the bound follows from the interconnection between the CP asymmetry and the
requirement that the cloistered sector will remain secluded from the active sector
or, in other words, from the requirement that the washout processes are kept under
control. This argument was ﬁrst put forth in [219], in the context of the inert Higgs
doublet model (the case of ˜(cid:96) in Table 1), and in relation to the derivation of a bound
on the mass of the lightest RH neutrino.

In cloistered baryogenesis, one is interested in the case in which a Majorana
RH neutrino decays in a SM u-type quark and in the complex conjugate of a new

Niχm˜χ+Ni˜χχmNj˜χ′χ′nχm˜χNj˜χχmNi+41

scalar ˜u of equal baryon charge. However, the argument does not apply only to
the inert Higgs doublet model or to cloistered baryogenesis, but it is quite general.
Although below we will present it referring to a B asymmetry, we are conﬁdent
that its wide range of validity will be easily understood. Consider a generic U (1)B
invariant interaction between two self conjugate particles Xi = X c
i (i = 1, 2) and
two other complex ﬁelds Y and Z carrying opposite U (1)B charges

where g1 and gs are two relatively complex parameters Arg(g∗1g2)
= 0. In general
Xi can be Majorana fermions while Y and Z a pair of complex scalar and fermion
or Xi can be real scalars while Y and Z a pair of fermions or complex scalars.
In the ﬁrst two cases gi are dimensionless couplings while in the last case they
have mass dimension one. Now let us assume MX2 > MX1 > MY + MZ such
Y Z, ¯Y ¯Z are kinematically allowed. These decays are in
that the decays Xi →
general CP-violating, implying that B asymmetries in Y and Z that are equal in
size and opposite in sign can be generated. Let us further assume that X1 decays
while electroweak sphalerons are still active and that Y has in-equilibrium chemical
reactions with electroweak sphalerons while Z remains chemically decoupled from
the thermal bath, i.e. cloistered. The B asymmetry in Z, denoted by ∆BZ, remains
constant, while the B asymmetry carried by Y gets quickly distributed among
the SM particles through electroweak sphalerons. Due to partial conversion to L
asymmetry, the B asymmetry in the thermal bath is no longer balanced by the one
∆BZ. Eventually after electroweak sphalerons switch
stored in Z i.e. ∆BSM (cid:54)
oﬀ, the B conserving decays of Z into the SM particles give rise to a nonzero total
B asymmetry ∆B = ∆BSM + ∆BZ (cid:54)

The CP asymmetry between Y baryons and ¯Y anti-baryons produced in X1
decays can be deﬁned as the diﬀerences in their decay widths normalized over their

Ref. [219] that, by taking a ﬁnal state mass of the order of MX1, due to Boltzmann
suppression of the washout scatterings it is possible to lower the scale MX1 down to
the TeV region. Arranging for such a condition, the leptogenesis scenarios proposed
in Ref. [233] becomes viable also at the TeV scale. (See Sec. 3 for details about the
conditions required for lowering the scale of leptogenesis from out-of-equilibrium
decays.)

4.1.2. Cloistered baryogenesis

In the following, we will present a simple model which realizes cloistered baryoge-
nesis [235]. We consider the fourth model of Table 1, in which besides three RH
singlet fermions Nk a new scalar ˜u with the SM quantum numbers of the SU (2)
singlet RH up-type quark u is also introduced. The relevant terms involving ˜u are

In the initial stage, the decays of N1 generate an equal and opposite sign B asymmetries
respectively in u and ˜u denoted by ∆Bu and ∆B˜u. At electroweak sphaleron decoupling the B
asymmetry in SM particles ∆BSM is no longer equal in magnitude to the opposite sign asymmetry
∆B˜u due to the electroweak sphaleron processes which distribute the initial ∆Bu among the SM
particles in which part of the asymmetry resides in the lepton sector. As a result, we obtain a net
nonzero baryon asymmetry ∆BSM + ∆B˜u

arguments rule out the possibility of cosmologically stable heavy colored particles
[243–245], ˜u must eventually decay. It is a feature automatically embedded in our
model that ˜u will decay only after electroweak symmetry breaking. Decays can in
fact proceed through the mixing between active and RH neutrinos (ν–N ), which
opens up the decay channel ˜u
uaν. After electroweak symmetry breaking and
switch oﬀ of electroweak sphaleron processes, the ∆B˜u released into the thermal
bath from ˜u decays remains largely unbalanced by the baryon asymmetry already
present in the thermal bath, resulting in a net nonzero baryon asymmetry. The
mechanism for this scenario is sketched in Fig. 13. Notice that at this temperatures
the CP asymmetry for the standard N1 leptogenesis (assuming a hierarchical RH
neutrino mass spectrum) is way too small [23]. Here for simplicity we will assume

Using the method advocated in Ref. [246] once we identiﬁed the eﬀective U (1)

related to the asymmetry stored in ˜u. The crucial point is that U (1)˜u remains an

Let us conclude by pointing out that the discovery at the LHC or at future
colliders of new, relatively long-lived scalars, with similar properties to the ones
discussed in this review, will support the possibility that baryogenesis arises from
extended seesaw models of type I. To avoid issues with BBN, the lifetime of these

Nevertheless, to probe directly that these scenarios are truly responsible for the
cosmological baryon asymmetry would require producing also Nk. However, as was
shown in [233], bringing down the RH neutrino mass scale to energies accessible at
foreseeable colliders remains quite challenging, and it would require, for example,
quasi-degenerate Nk to resonantly enhance the CP asymmetries.

4.2. Extensions to type II and III seesaw models

As well-known and already emphasized above, to generate the neutrino masses at
tree-level, an exchange of RH neutrinos between SM lepton and scalar doublets is
not the only possibility. There exist two alternatives, from the exchange of one
or more scalar triplets with hypercharge Y = 2 (type II seesaw) and from the ex-
change of self-conjugate triplets of fermions (type III seesaw). These scenarios oﬀer
the possibility to generate the lepton asymmetry from the decay of these heavy
scalar triplets (type II leptogenesis [212, 250–256]) or of these fermion triplets (type
III leptogenesis [212, 257–260]). In order to discuss possibilities of testing/falsifying
these scenarios it is necessary to brieﬂy review how they work, discussing in partic-
ular the eﬀects of gauge scatterings. For a detailed review, see Ref. [212].

The relevant Lagrangians for the type II and type III seesaw models are given in
Table 2, together with their contribution to neutrino masses and the deﬁnition of the
total lepton number CP asymmetries they lead to. Type II or type III seesaw states
appear naturally in many gauge extensions of the SM. These extensions include the
usual left-right (L-R) models and renormalizable SO(10) models, which on top of
RH neutrinos involve a type II SU (2)L scalar triplet (related, together with its
SU (2)R partner, to the generation of the RH neutrino masses). Other examples
are the SU (5) models with an adjoint fermion representation [258, 261–265], which
contains both a type I and a type III seesaw state. Seesaw models with an extended
gauge sector will be discussed in more detail in Sec. 5 and in Sec. 6 in the context
of Supersymmmetry.

A single seesaw state cannot lead to successful leptogenesis because such a state
cannot generate alone the necessary CP asymmetry. But, if at least a second seesaw
state exists, as in all these GUT inspired models, this is possible. For instance, as
shown in Fig. 15, from the decay of a scalar triplet one can generate a CP asymmetry
from a diagram involving any heavier seesaw state, for example a heavier second

lightest state is a RH neutrino, still, the presence of a heavier triplet can modify
the type I leptogenesis scenario [252, 266], because it will contribute to the CP
asymmetries of the RH neutrinos, see the last diagram of Fig. 15. For the pure type
III leptogenesis scenario the diagrams are the same as for the type I case, replacing
each of the RH neutrinos in these diagrams by a SU (2)L triplet [257].

Similarly to the type I case, the type II and III leptogenesis scenarios highly

depend on the type of seesaw state mass spectrum. By far the simplest case arises
if the seesaw states have a hierarchical spectrum. It is easy to show that in this
case, the total lepton number CP asymmetries depend on the heavy seesaw states
(which are virtual in the one-loop diagram) only through their contributions to the
neutrino mass matrix [267], whereas they depend on the decaying state through
both its contribution to the neutrino mass matrix and its mass. For the type II
and III cases, for each of the 3 triplet components, the CP asymmetry takes the
form [252, 253, 257]

hierarchical spectrum of seesaw states, the produced lepton asymmetry depends
only on the mass and interactions of the lightest state, and on the contribution of
the heavy seesaw states to the neutrino mass matrix, no matter what these heavy
states are. As these equations show, the smaller the mass of the decaying seesaw
state is, the smaller is the CP asymmetry. This implies that successful leptogenesis
requires this mass scale to be large enough. As mentioned already in Sec. 3, this
lower bound is of order 1010 GeV. For a quasi-degenerate spectrum of seesaw states,
these simple picture and bounds do not hold.
In this case, self-energy diagrams
involving two states of the same type, such as in the ﬁrst diagram of Fig. 15, are
resonantly enhanced. This allows successful leptogenesis for much smaller mass
scales. Thus, as for type I leptogenesis, it is the quasi-degenerate case, which is
relevant for possible tests, as already generally discussed in Sec. 3.

Triplets, unlike RH neutrinos, undergo gauge interactions, leading in particular
SM SM transitions. These processes do not cause any washout eﬀect,

TA, the gauge
when one of these two conditions is not fulﬁlled anymore, say at T
scatterings have a negligible eﬀect. As the γA/γD ratio is Boltzmann suppressed at
T < MX (due to the double Boltzmann suppression of γA), this decoupling of the
gauge scatterings always happens for MX /TA not larger than a few. This is why at
T > TA no substantial asymmetry can be created, but afterwards it can, because the
number of triplets remaining at this time and decaying afterwards, which is given
MX /TA, can be substantial. This explains [251, 253] why type II or
by
type III leptogenesis can still be successful for MX much smaller than 1014 GeV.
However, the smaller MX is, the more the gauge scatterings are in thermal equilib-
rium at T
MX . The larger MX /TA is, the smaller is the asymmetry produced.
In practice, see the details in Ref. [212], the ﬁnal asymmetry depends on whether at
TA the decay/inverse decay rate is still in thermal equilibrium. If they are not
T
in thermal equilibrium, the ﬁnal asymmetry produced is not aﬀected by any washout
eﬀect from inverse decays and one lies in the so-called “gauge regime” [212, 260]. In
the opposite case, one lies in the “Yukawa regime”, where, at T
TA, one enters in
a strong washout regime, in case the ﬁnal asymmetry does not depend on the fact
that there were gauge scatterings occurring at T > TA [212, 260].

The type III leptogenesis scenario diﬀers from the type I scenario mainly by the
fact that it involves this gauge scattering eﬀect (besides the fact that it involves a
number of decaying and virtual states in the one-loop diagrams which is three times
larger than for the type I case). As a result of this eﬀect, the lower bound on the
lightest triplet for a hierarchical mass spectrum of seesaw states is a factor of about
two orders of magnitude [257] larger than for the type I case, MΣ (cid:38) 3
1010 GeV. Be-
low this mass scale, the number of triplets remaining at the temperature TA, whose
subsequent decays produce the asymmetry, is already too Boltzmann suppressed to
produce a large enough lepton asymmetry (given the CP asymmetry in this case,
Eq. (62)). For a quasi-degenerate spectrum of triplet fermions, the resonance of the
self-energy diagram allows for much larger CP asymmetries. Still, the lower MΣ is,
the larger is the gauge reaction rate with respect to the Hubble rate at T
MΣ, the
larger is MΣ/TA, the more the remaining number of triplets at TA is Boltzmann
suppressed, the less an asymmetry is produced. For instance, for MΣ = 1 TeV,
25. At this temperature the number of triplets remaining is so
one gets MΣ/TA ∼
suppressed that even with CP asymmetries of order unity successful leptogenesis
cannot proceed. One obtains the lower bound from taking a CP asymmetry of order
one [259]

MΣ > 1.6 TeV .

Note that ﬂavor eﬀects have no impact on this bound. These eﬀects for type III
leptogenesis have been incorporated in Ref. [260]. For the regime where the inverse
decays do have an impact on the asymmetry (Yukawa regime), they can be relevant,
by reducing the washout eﬀect from these inverse decays, similarly to the ﬂavor
eﬀects in type I leptogenesis. In contrast, for the regime where inverse decays can
be neglected (gauge regime), the suppression comes only from the gauge scatterings.
These processes and the resulting suppression are ﬂavor blind: gauge scatterings
put nX close to neq
X no matter Boltzmann equations are considered for individual
lepton ﬂavors or only for the total lepton number. The 1.6 TeV bound above is
clearly obtained deeply in the gauge regime.

The gauge scatterings have the same eﬀects in type II and type III leptogenesis.
This is why the bound we get with a quasi-degenerate spectrum, i.e. with CP
asymmetries of order unity from the self-energy diagram involving at least two
diﬀerent scalar triplets, is basically the same [259]

M∆ > 1.6 TeV .

(66)

However, the dynamics operating for type II leptogenesis for the creation of the
asymmetry is quite diﬀerent from the one in the fermion seesaw cases. One impor-
tant diﬀerence is that a scalar triplet, unlike the type I and type III states, is not
self-conjugated. This implies that one must distinguish the number of triplets and
antitriplets. Both number densities do not necessarily evolve in the same way. As a
result, with respect to the other cases, the type II leptogenesis scenario involves one
more Boltzmann equation, determining the triplet-antitriplet asymmetry number
density. Moreover, unlike the fermion seesaw states, which involve only one type
of couplings (the Yukawa couplings), the type II seesaw is based on two completely
diﬀerent interactions: the coupling of the scalar triplet to two Higgs doublets and to
two lepton doublets, whose coexistence breaks lepton number. This leads naturally
to situations where one decay channel could proceed much faster than the other, re-
sulting in an approximate conservation of lepton number, even if the triplets decay
at a rate much larger than the Hubble rate. All in all, this implies that the interplay
of Boltzmann equations can be very diﬀerent from the fermion cases, resulting in a
diﬀerent dynamics. For instance, this allows a lepton asymmetry to be eﬀectively
stored in a large triplet-antitriplet asymmetry which is created ﬁrst, and which will
lead to a lepton asymmetry afterwards, when these states will decay. Details can
be found in Refs. [212, 253], including the lower bound on the scalar triplet mass
in the hierarchical case (which around 1010 GeV depends on the contribution of
the heavier seesaw states to the neutrino mass matrix). Similarly, these eﬀects and
the fact that a single scalar triplet can induce all three neutrino masses (unlike a
fermion seesaw state, which can induce only one) lead to diﬀerent ﬂavor dynamics
when the ﬂavor eﬀects are incorporated [254–256], see also the related discussion
in [24].

All the discussion above, in particular on the role of the gauge scatterings,
lead us to a situation which is representative of the diﬃculties one has to face

50

when one tries to ﬁnd ways to test leptogenesis. The fact that the type II and
type III seesaw states undergo gauge interactions is welcome from the point of
view of discovering the seesaw states at the LHC. These states, unlike the type I
seesaw fermions, can be pair produced via SM gauge interactions [261, 263, 268–271],
and they are intensively searched for at the LHC experiments. The seesaw states
can also lead in addition to speciﬁc signatures, in particular displaced vertices,
since at LHC energies the seesaw mechanism naturally predicts small values of the
seesaw couplings, leading to slow decays, i.e. characteristic displaced vertices [269].
However, as discussed above, the very same interactions that allow seesaw states
production also imply that these states will be pretty close to thermal equilibrium
when they decay, leading to very large suppression of the produced asymmetry at
these energies. In particular, even in the best situation where the CP asymmetry is
of order unity, one cannot go below the
1.6 TeV lower bound above, due to this
∼
eﬀect. This scale turns out to be already a bit too high to be reachable at LHC. But
at the very least this oﬀers clear possibilities of falsifying these leptogenesis scenarios
or even any leptogenesis scenario producing the asymmetry at higher energies. For
instance a triplet which would be discovered at the LHC would not be able to
produce the asymmetry through its decay but could washout a previously produced
asymmetry, if it has large enough interactions (to all lepton ﬂavors). More generally
if these triplets are present at LHC energies they could come with other associated
states, such as in the L-R model which, on top of the scalar triplets, involves a
ZR or a WR. The discovery of such associated states, especially a WR (because its
thermalization eﬀect is extremely eﬃcient at these energies, see Sec. 5 below) could
rule out type I leptogenesis, in case at the seesaw level one would be left with the
type II or type III options.

Extensions of the low scale type II/III leptogenesis scenarios usually involve
the addition of new scalars and fermions, which either implement the resonant
enhancement of the asymmetry or provide an additional/dominant contribution
to the neutrino mass generation (see, e.g., [210, 272–281]). In some scenarios (see
Ref. [278] for an example of TeV scale type II and Refs. [279, 280] for TeV scale type
I/III (inverse) seesaw mechanisms), an initial asymmetry is dynamically produced
from lepton number conserving decays of new electroweak singlet ﬁelds and in a
second step transferred to the SM leptons through the same Yukawa interactions
which contribute to neutrino mass generation via the seesaw mechanism. All in all,
this separation between the scale involved in the generation of the lepton/baryon
asymmetry and the one responsible for neutrino masses, typically, increases the
phenomenology and testability of this class of models. In particular, the new TeV
scale ﬁelds carrying gauge interactions provide speciﬁc collider signatures, testable
in the current run of LHC. Note that for type I leptogenesis low scale alternatives
[210, 219, 282, 283] to the resonant mechanism are to consider a radiative generation
of the neutrino masses, with either a hierarchy of couplings for the various seesaw
states or with seesaw states decaying to three-body decays rather than to two-body

51

decays. To generate in those ways the baryon asymmetry from the decay of type
II or III states does not help much because, still in these cases, too large gauge
scatterings heavily suppress the result at low scale.

5. Testability of leptogenesis with extended gauge sectors

So far we just covered leptogenesis within seesaw models that are based on an ex-
tended matter sector with particles obeying the SM gauge groups. In the following,
we open up the discussion for models with an extended gauge sector and allow for
the observation of an additional gauge boson. As an example, we discuss the Z (cid:48)
and the L-R symmetric model.

5.1. TeV leptogenesis in Z(cid:48) models

RH neutrinos realizing the seesaw mechanism may be connected to the presence
of an extra gauge symmetry U (1)(cid:48) and an extra gauge boson Z (cid:48) at the TeV scale,
which can be searched for at colliders. However, such U (1)(cid:48) seesaw models have
a diﬃculty to provide successful baryogenesis as the resulting lepton asymmetry is
highly suppressed by eﬃcient gauge annihilations through Z (cid:48) mediation. Such a
strong suppression may be compensated by a resonant enhancement, which generi-
cally involves an unpleasant ﬁne-tuning. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to see
if leptogenesis can work successfully in Z (cid:48) models, or to set a limit on the Z (cid:48) mass
(or the U (1)(cid:48) gauge coupling, g(cid:48)) for successful leptogenesis. Assuming the standard
2/4π = 1/60 and maximal CP asymmetry, the Z (cid:48)
gauge coupling strength α(cid:48)
≡
mass has to be larger than 2
3 TeV [284]. It will be an interesting task to ﬁnd
such a heavy Z (cid:48) and the associated large CP violation required for TeV leptogenesis
at colliders.

g(cid:48)

For a deﬁnite discussion, we assume a Z (cid:48) model with U (1)χ [285–287]. In terms
of the SU (5) notation, the SM fermions and the singlet ﬁeld N carry the U (1)χ
charges as follows:

leptogenesis can work even with one RH neutrino via “soft leptogenesis” and the

expects from such large K and an even larger gauge annihilation eﬀect, the RH
sneutrinos follow closely the thermal equilibrium distribution until very low tem-
perature, and the lepton asymmetry freezes out at large z, that is, T < 100 GeV.
Such a behavior is shown in Fig. 16, in which the evolution of the lepton asymme-
try, log(Y∆L/(cid:15)), is plotted. The lepton asymmetry increases for a larger MZ(cid:48), as
annihilation processes are suppressed for heavy MZ(cid:48). For lager z, the asymmetry
reaches an asymptotic value for which the annihilation eﬀect eventually drops out
due to Boltzmann suppression.

∼

Let us note that the lepton asymmetry is still increasing during the electroweak
phase transition at T
100 GeV, which is well before the asymptotic value is
reached. Therefore, it is important to include the sphaleron eﬀect after phase
transition to obtain the right value for the baryon asymmetry. To do this, let

main features of the seesaw mechanism [47, 294–297], namely, the existence of

saw model. Here, the RH neutrinos are a necessary part of the model guaranteed
by the gauge symmetry and anomaly cancellations, and do not have to be added
ab initio to implement the seesaw mechanism [47, 294–297]. An important point is
that the RH neutrinos acquire a Majorana mass as soon as the SU (2)R symmetry
is broken at a scale vR. This is quite analogous to the way the charged fermions
get masses in the SM by the Higgs mechanism when the SU (2)L gauge symmetry
is broken at the EW scale v. The Higgs ﬁeld that gives mass to the RH neutrinos
becomes the analogue of the 125 GeV Higgs boson discovered at the LHC.

Just as in the minimal seesaw with RH neutrinos, the observed baryon asym-
metry of the Universe can be explained in the L-R seesaw by the mechanism of
leptogenesis. For this to be both eﬃcient and testable in laboratory experiments,
we need two main ingredients: (i) low RH scale vR not far above the TeV scale, so
that the RH neutrino eﬀects are experimentally accessible; (ii) quasi-degeneracy be-
tween at least two RH neutrinos, with the mass diﬀerence comparable to their decay
widths in order to have a resonant enhancement of the CP asymmetry [68, 224, 301],
109 GeV on the RH neutrino
thus avoiding the Davidson-Ibarra lower bound of
mass [23, 302] for successful leptogenesis (see Eq. (7)). Unlike in the minimal seesaw
case, we do not necessarily require the Yukawa couplings to be large in L-R seesaw
for observable RH neutrino eﬀects, thanks to the purely RH gauge interactions. For
instance, both the production and decay of the RH neutrinos at colliders can proceed
via the RH charged-current process pp

However, the same RH gauge interactions that lead to new experimental signals
in the L-R seesaw could have potentially dangerous eﬀects on successful leptoge-

equations, it was concluded in [319] that even for maximal CP asymmetry (cid:15)
(1),
the observed value of the baryon asymmetry can be explained by leptogenesis in
the minimal L-R model, only if MWR ≥
18 TeV. Turning this argument around, if
a positive signal for WR is observed at the LHC, this will falsify leptogenesis in L-R
seesaw framework. It is worth noting here that the leptogenesis constraint on WR
is signiﬁcantly more stringent than that on Z (cid:48) (see Section 5.1) mainly because the
Z (cid:48)-induced RH neutrino scattering processes are doubly Boltzmann suppressed, and
therefore, their interaction rates drop more quickly than the decay/inverse decay
rate and the WR induced scattering, which are simply Boltzmann suppressed.

Since this is such an important issue for the survival of the L-R seesaw lep-
togenesis, it is worth examining the robustness of the lower bound on MWR to
see if there exists any allowed parameter space in TeV-scale L-R seesaw models
with successful leptogenesis for smaller values of MWR . The basic idea is that the
only source term for leptogenesis comes from the CP-violating RH neutrino decays
(cid:96)φ, (cid:96)cφc, which depends on the Dirac Yukawa coupling. So, for a class of the
N
L-R seesaw models with larger Yukawa couplings [323], it is in principle possible to
overcome the large dilution eﬀect induced by a lighter WR, thereby weakening the
lower bound on MWR [320, 321]. Of course, a TeV-scale type I seesaw with large
Yukawa couplings comes with the price of ﬁne-tuning in the seesaw matrix in order
to be consistent with the light neutrino oscillation data [324]. However, such special
textures of the Dirac and Majorana neutrino mass matrices can be motivated from
some ﬂavor symmetry in the leptonic sector, which ensures their stability against
large radiative corrections [323, 325]. For such L-R seesaw models with large Dirac
Yukawa couplings and taking into account ﬂavor eﬀects, it was found that successful
9.9 TeV for the maximal CP asymmetry [321]. A sim-
leptogenesis requires MWR ≥
ilar estimate of this absolute lower bound was also given in Ref. [319]. This absolute
lower bound is not too far from the generic bound of 18 TeV, which is consistent

57

with the expectation that ﬂavor eﬀects cannot signiﬁcantly alter the results because
gauge scatterings are ﬂavor-blind. For comparison, the √s = 14 TeV LHC with the
high-luminosity option can probe WR masses only up to 5-6 TeV [326]. Therefore,
a positive signal for WR at the LHC will indeed falsify leptogenesis as a mechanism
for understanding the origin of matter in L-R seesaw framework.

In summary, observing a heavy WR gauge boson at the LHC would directly
exclude leptogenesis in the L-R symmetric model, as for MWR < 10 TeV the dilution
eﬀect due to WR-induced scattering processes is too strong to yield the observed
baryon asymmetry. Hereby, the precise limit on the WR mass depends highly on the
assumption of Dirac Yukawa couplings as was discussed above, but the statement
on the falsiﬁability of leptogenesis by the LHC holds true in all cases studied here.

6. Testability of supersymmetric leptogenesis

When supersymmetry (SUSY) is imposed on leptogenesis, new (undesirable, neutral
and desirable) features arise:

(1) Undesirable. The main undesirable feature is the gravitino problem [328,
329]:v The thermal production of gravitinos increases with the reheating
temperature TR. While the limit on its abundance places an upper bound

vTo include gravity, SUSY should be local.

62

on TR (in order not to overclose the Universe), thermal production of RH
neutrinos for leptogenesis requires a minimum TR. The severity of this ten-
sion is model-dependent: besides TR and the gravitino mass, it also depends
on the mass spectrum of supersymmetric particles. For stable gravitinos
(a form of dark matter) TR (cid:46) 109 GeV (see a recent study [330] and the
references therein) while for unstable gravitinos TR (cid:46) 105
1010 GeV with
stringent bounds coming mainly from BBN constraints (see Ref. [331] and
the references therein). For hierarchical RH neutrinos, however, a dedi-
cated study [332] in supersymmetric type I leptogenesis gives TR (cid:38) 109
GeV. (See Sec. 4 for possibilities of lowering the scale of leptogenesis by
extending seesaw models.)

−

(2) Neutral. Doubling degrees of freedom and new eﬀective global symme-
tries at high temperature are neutral features [333]. In type I leptogenesis,
the impact of doubling degrees of freedom [334–336] and new global sym-
metries [337] give rise to
(1) modiﬁcations with respect to non-SUSY
scenarios.

O

(3) Desirable. A desirable feature of SUSY leptogenesis is the introduction of
new sources of CP violation, arising from the soft SUSY breaking terms (or
just soft terms) [283, 338–340]. Via dimensional analysis, one can naively
estimate the leading CP parameter from the soft term of scale msoft to be

This relaxes or completely avoids the gravitino problem. In a particular

be obtained [341], turning the previously neutral feature to a desirable one.

6.1. Type I soft leptogenesis

Here we will work within the framework of type I seesaw soft leptogenesis based
on [339, 340] (see a recent review [342]). Since the CP violation comes from soft
terms, leptogenesis proceeds through decays of RH sneutrinos
Nk and its antipar-
N ∗k . In particular, soft leptogenesis can proceed even within one generation
ticles
of RH sneutrinos since the otherwise degenerate masses of
N ∗k within a
single generation will be split due to the presence of soft bilinear Bk terms. In the
following we will assume that the RH neutrinos are hierarchical such that only the
N1 is relevant for soft leptogenesis. Henceforth, we will drop
lightest RH sneutrino
N1 and λα ≡
the family index of RH neutrinos, e.g. N

λα1, etc..

In the original proposal [339, 340] a soft trilinear term Aα which is proportional
to the neutrino Yukawa coupling Aα = Aλα was assumed. As a result, the leading
CP violation vanishes in the limit of zero temperature, while only with thermal
eﬀects, the cancellation between asymmetries from the decays of RH sneutrinos to
leptons and sleptons is avoided, resulting in a ﬁnite, but suppressed total lepton
asymmetry. Furthermore, a small soft bilinear term B
msoft is required to
resonantly enhance the CP violation to achieve successful leptogenesis.

(cid:28)

In the following, however, we will focus on a generic trilinear soft Aα term [343]

in soft leptogenesis [344], which results in interesting consequences:

(a) The leading CP violation can be nonzero even when thermal corrections

are neglected, implying a nonthermal and enhanced CP violation.

(b) The mixing CP violation away from the resonance is of the order of λαAα/B
msoft can be

and large enough for leptogenesis. As a result, a natural B
maintained.

∼

(c) The generic Aα gives contributions to charged lepton ﬂavor violating pro-
cesses which are close to the sensitivities of present and future experiments.

In order to discuss the aforementioned consequences, we assume the temperature
range T (cid:46) 108 GeV for msoft ∼
1 TeV, where the eﬀective global symmetries
discussed in Ref. [333] are absent. The enhancement eﬀects of eﬀective global sym-
metries in soft leptogenesis are discussed in Ref. [341] and will not be considered
further.

far away from the resonant regime. We see that nonthermal CP
violation can signiﬁcantly enhance the eﬃciency of soft leptogenesis. Notice that we
have assumed some hierarchies in A and λ to illustrate lepton ﬂavor eﬀects. Though
not crucial for leptogenesis, the hierarchy in A is needed to satisfy phenomenological
bounds, which we will discuss next.

In the following, we will discuss the phenomenology of having generic Aα. Since

MN can contribute to Electric Dipole Moments (EDM) of leptons and to Charged
Lepton Flavor Violating (CLFV) interactions. Under the assumption of universal-

contributions to lepton EDM and CLFV processes are much below the experimental
bounds. Here we will repeat the analysis by considering generic Aα. This, as we will
show below, can enhance the contributions to lepton EDM and CLFV processes.y

In conclusion, in the framework of supersymmetric type I seesaw, soft lepto-
genesis is an attractive mechanism to explain the cosmological matter-antimatter
asymmetry since it works at a lower temperature regime T (cid:46) 109 GeV, where the
tension caused by overproduction of gravitinos can be relaxed or even evaded. By
considering generic soft trilinear Aα couplings, we reach both, interesting theoret-
ical and phenomenological consequences. Theoretically, nonthermal CP violation

(cid:54)
69

can dominate and successful leptogenesis can be achieved with all relevant soft pa-
rameters taking natural values at the around the TeV-scale. Phenomenologically,
such large Aα couplings allow signiﬁcant contributions to CLFV processes that are
close to sensitivities of present and future experiments. While the direct probe of
soft leptogenesis with generic Aα terms will require the production of ˜N , which is
not possible with current or foreseeable particle colliders, the detection of CLFV
processes consistent with this framework will provide a boost of such a realization.

6.2. Type II soft leptogenesis

The type II seesaw, in which a Higgs triplet boson is responsible for the observed
neutrino masses and mixing, enjoys also the basic features of soft leptogenesis [364,
365]. Contrary to the type I leptogenesis, the type II leptogenesis suﬀers from rather
eﬃcient gauge annihilation processes, which strongly suppresses the resulting lepton
asymmetry (see the detailed discussion in Sec. 4.2). The gauge annihilation eﬀect
becomes weaker for higher Higgs triplet mass, which, however, suppresses the lepton
asymmetry in soft leptogenesis as it is inversely proportional to the Higgs triplet
mass. For TeV-scale seesaw, the huge suppression of lepton asymmetry by gauge
annihilations can be overcome by the eﬀect of soft SUSY breaking terms such that
successful TeV-scale leptogenesis can be obtained [365].

In the supersymmetric type II seesaw a vector-like pair of ∆ = (∆++, ∆+, ∆0)

Concerning the evolution of Y∆j with j = (cid:96)(cid:96) and ˜(cid:96)˜(cid:96), let us recall that the
combined lepton asymmetry vanishes in the supersymmetric limit, Y∆(cid:96) ≡
Y∆(cid:96)(cid:96) +
Y∆˜(cid:96)˜(cid:96) = 0, as the CP asymmetries in the bosonic and fermionic ﬁnal states takes
(cid:15)˜(cid:96)˜(cid:96). A nonvanishing lepton asymmetry arises after taking
the opposite sign, (cid:15)(cid:96)(cid:96) =

Boltzmann approximation to the second order. The total lepton asymmetry density

Combining the two simpliﬁed Boltzmann equations, Eq. (118) and Eq. (119), it
is straightforward to get solutions for the lepton asymmetry Y∆(cid:96). Figure 24 shows

A doubly charged boson in type II seesaw can lead to clean signals of same-
(cid:96)±α (cid:96)±β . The LHC13 data from the

integrated luminosity of 13.9 fb−
of 570 GeV assuming Br(∆±±
e±e±)=1 [366]. Observation of a same-sign di-
lepton resonance would be a hint for type II seesaw. A concrete conﬁrmation could
come from measuring branching ratios and checking if they are consistent with
the observed neutrino mass matrix as the type II seesaw relation requires Bαβ ≡

A more striking feature of type II seesaw is triplet-antitriplet oscillation, which
can lead to a signal of same-sign tetra-leptons [368]. Observation of such signals can
tell us about the triplet vacuum expectation value correlated with a tiny neutral
triplet mass splitting driven by the neutrino mass [368]. The triplet vev v∆ ≡

production of a triplet-antitriplet pair oscillates into a triplet (or antitriplet) pair

7. Model independent falsiﬁcation of high-scale leptogenesis

While the previous sections were mainly focused on probing a certain model of lepto-
genesis, we review now the possibility to falsify leptogenesis in a model independent
approach. Especially, when the generation mechanism of the lepton asymmetry is
at high scale, and thus diﬃcult to access experimentally, such a method can be a
powerful tool to narrow down possible underlying leptogenesis mechanisms.

Soon after scenarios of high energy baryogenesis, such as leptogenesis were de-
vised, it was realized that baryon and lepton number violating eﬀective operators
would washout the generated asymmetry [369, 370] (for further details we refer to
Sec. 3). In Refs. [98, 99, 371] , it was demonstrated that an observation of ∆L = 2
washout processes via non-standard contributions at experiments would directly
imply a sizable washout rate. Due to the signiﬁcant washout, leptogenesis models
that generate a lepton asymmetry above the scale of observation could be excluded,
leading to an insuﬃcient small baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale.

The low energy eﬀects can be described by ∆L = 2 operators of odd mass
dimension, assuming no other light particles beyond the SM at or below the elec-
troweak scale. A full list of all possible 129 ∆L = 2 operators up to 11-dim is given
in Ref. [372] , extending the work of Ref. [373] . These operators can be probed
in diﬀerent experimental set ups, e.g. at the LHC [98], neutrinoless double beta
decay [99], meson decays [374–377], or other low energy experiments [378, 379] (for
an overview see e.g. Ref. [380]). Especially sensitive to such ∆L = 2 operators are
0νββ decay experiments. As depicted in Fig. 26, 0νββ decay could be realized not
only by the standard Weinberg operator (Fig. 26 (a)), but also via a long- (Fig. 26
(b)) or short-range contribution (Fig. 26 (c,d)). We quote one operator for each

contribute as well to the washout processes in the early Universe. Applying the

Assuming an observation of 0νββ decay at the current (Fig. 27, left bars) and
future sensitivities (Fig. 27, right bars), the corresponding temperature interval for
a highly eﬃcient washout can be obtained. This leads to the main result, directly
extractable from Fig. 27: If 0νββ was discovered and was not triggered by the
standard Weinberg operator, this will imply that any baryogenesis mechanism will
be excluded above the scale ˆλD, implying anywhere but close to the electroweak
scale.

This, however, makes it necessary to being able to distinguish between the Wein-
berg operator and other higher dimensional operators. Although being a challenge,
this is not an impossible task:

•

0νββ decay triggered by a 9-dim or 11-dim operator hints towards a visible
signature at the LHC. In contrast, the scale of a 7-dim or 5-dim operator
is already pushed towards too high values in order to be observable at the

LHC [98]. Possible signatures include an invariant mass peak correspond-
ing to the mass of the new physics particle created on-shell or a possible
asymmetry in the rate of e+e+ and e−e− ﬁnal states [383–385].
Speciﬁcally the 7-dim operator can be probed with the future SuperNEMO
experiment, as it will be able to measure the angular and energy distribu-
tion of the two electrons involved in 0νββ. As 0νββ decay realized by a
long-range contribution features a signature of a left- and a right-handed
electron in contrast to two left-handed ones for the standard mass mecha-
nism, SuperNEMO will be able to distinguish them [386].
A comparison with cosmology can as well reveal a new physics contribution.
A discrepancy between the sum of the neutrino masses from cosmology and
from 0νββ decay experiments would imply that 0νββ is not realised
mββ|
|
by the Weinberg operator.
A discrepancy when comparing the experimental ratio of the 0νββ half-
life of diﬀerent isotopes with the theoretical prediction could as well hint
towards new physics contributions. While systematic uncertainties and ef-
fective couplings cancel by considering the ratio T1/2(76Ge)/T1/2(AX) =
2G(AX)), the ratio of the half-life, how-
(
|

ever, still depends on the model dependent matrix element and phase space
factor and is thus sensitive to new physics [387].
As demonstrated in Ref. [388], the comparison between 0νβ−β− decay and
0νβ+/EC or 0νβ−β− and 0νβ+β+ decay can point us as well towards new
physics. Similarly, the comparison between 0νββ decay to the ground state
and an excited state is interesting with that respect [389].

In order to guarantee that no lepton asymmetry is hidden in another ﬂavor sector,
LNV should be observed as well in the µµ and τ τ sector or in lepton ﬂavor violating
(LFV) ∆L = 0 rare decays. In order to estimate above which scale an equilibration
of an asymmetry between ﬂavors is highly eﬃcient, a similar analysis as outlined
above was performed in Ref. [99]. To this end, the corresponding operators

Cllγ ¯(cid:96)lσµν ¯lcHFµν and

corresponding rare decays at their current and future sensitivity, the operator scale

can be evaluated

Although this approach is conservative and model independent, certain limi-

where the parton distribution function fq1q2 has to be singled out for calculating
the reaction density of the washout process in the early Universe. As shown in
Fig. 29 (left), the observation of an LNV signal at the LHC would imply a signiﬁcant
washout such that high-scale leptogenesis models would be excluded. Similarly, this
was discussed in Sec. 5.2 within the context of the L-R symmetric model, where
10 TeV would exclude viable
a discovery of a heavy WR with a mass below
leptogenesis.
If the CP asymmetry is generated below the scale of the resonant
mass MX , a falsiﬁcation is not necessarily possible, however, a lower limit on the
CP asymmetry can be set in order to create the observed baryon asymmetry ηobs
with the washout present. In order to demonstrate this, a scale MN at which the
CP asymmetry of order ω is generated was considered [98]

The results are shown in Fig. 29 (right). For MN < MX , there exists a lower limit

leptogenesis models.
In concordance with the discussion before, for MX < MN ,
high-scale leptogenesis models would be excluded. Similarly to the discussion of the
limitations with respect to 0νββ decay, it should be guaranteed that no asymmetry
is stored in another ﬂavor. To this end, diﬀerent ﬂavor combinations should be

In this chapter, we have reviewed the possibility to probe leptogenesis models at
experiments. In Table 3 we show an overview of experimental signatures probing
diﬀerent leptogenesis models, in Table 4 signatures are summarized which allow for
falsifying certain models.

We commenced this chapter with GeV-scale leptogenesis, discussing experimen-
tal prospects of the type I seesaw model that allows for a baryon asymmetry via the
ARS-mechanism. In Sec. 2.1, we reviewed the experimental prospects of the mini-
mal seesaw model with n = 2 RH neutrinos in the oscillatory regime. We showed
that the input from neutrino oscillation experiments, neutrinoless double beta de-
cay searches, and future searches for heavy leptons at SHiP or high intensity e+e−
colliders might be suﬃcient in order to fully constrain the model by the observed
baryon asymmetry of our Universe and is thus possible to be probed. In contrast to
the naive seesaw regime, we reviewed in Sec. 2.1 the symmetry protected scenario
in the overdamped regime. It can accommodate successful leptogenesis for much

Table 3. Overview of experimental signatures of diﬀerent leptogenesis/baryogenesis models. Besides ARS
leptogenesis where the mass scale of new particles is around GeV, other leptogenesis/baryogenesis models from
decays require new particles to be above the electroweak sphalerons freeze-out temperature TEWSp (lattice
2.3 GeV [69]) such that a nonzero baryon asymmetry can be induced. In
calculation gives TEWSp = 131.7
general, low-scale realizations of the second type of models face two issues due to constraints from (a) the
light neutrino mass scale (b) washout from scatterings as described in Sec. 3. The scale can be lowered down
to TEWSp by evoking resonant enhancement from almost degenerate decaying particles (see Sec. 3 for details).

larger mixing angles and leads hence to larger branching ratios. As for relatively
large U 2, the requirement U 2
α/U 2 << 1 has to be met for at least one ﬂavor in order
to generate successfully the correct baryon asymmetry, a comparison of all three
U 2
α can be used as a test for leptogenesis. As leptogenesis via the ARS-mechanism
requires light RH neutrinos, they can be searched for at experiments. The current
constraints on RH neutrino was reviewed in Sec. 2.3 including direct and indirect
searches, cosmological and “global” constraints. Another hint for RH neutrinos are
lepton-number violating meson decays. The possibility to measure CP violation in
these rare decays was discussed in Sec. 2.4.

After focusing on the testability of leptogenesis from oscillations, we discussed
the possibility to probe leptogenesis from out-of-equilibrium decays.
In Sec. 3,
we summarized the problems that have to be addressed in order to obtain TeV-
scale leptogenesis. We outlined three mechanisms in order overcome the destructive
interplay between CP asymmetry generation and washout processes and to achieve
models testable at current experiments: almost degenerate particles, late decays or
massive decay products.

We then reviewed diﬀerent models which allow for viable TeV-scale leptogen-
esis. We started with extensions of the standard, vanilla seesaw models involving

81

new matter ﬁelds. After discussing the diﬀerent possibilities to extend the type I
seesaw model with scalar particles charged under SM quantum numbers, and af-
ter identifying the corresponding complications to achieve low-scale leptogenesis,
we highlighted cloistered baryogenesis in Sec. 4.1.
In this mechanism, a global
U (1)B is imposed. The decays of heavy states N generate an equal in size and
opposite in sign baryon asymmetry in the two daughter particle species u and ˜u
∆B˜u). While the u-sector couples to electroweak sphalerons, the ˜u sec-
(∆Bu =
tor remains chemically decoupled (cloistered), and since baryon asymmetry in u
gets partially converted to lepton asymmetry, it does no longer balance the asym-
metry stored in ˜u. Eventually ˜u particles decay into SM particles but only after
electroweak sphalerons freeze out, so that a non-vanishing total baryon asymmetry
= 0 results. This scenario requires a new long-lived particle
∆B = ∆Bu + ∆B˜u (cid:54)
carrying color and baryon number, which can be looked for at hadron colliders.

In Sec. 4.2, we then discussed limitations and possible extensions to type II and
type III seesaw models. Triplets, unlike heavy neutrinos, undergo gauge interac-
tions. These do not lead to any washout, however, they get thermalized which leads
to a suppression of the lepton asymmetry: If the gauge interaction rate is larger
than the Hubble rate and the decay rate, the asymmetry production is suppressed
by the ratio of these two rates. This leads to a lower bound on the triplet mass
1010GeV. Assuming a quasi-degenerate spectrum and a CP asymmetry
MΣ > 3
of order one, the bound can be lowered to MΣ > 1.6 TeV for type III, holding
as well for M∆ in type II. This opens up the possibility to falsify these scenarios
by discovering lighter states. Unlike type I seesaw states, the new heavy states in
type II and type III seesaw can be pair produced at the LHC and are intensively
searched for. Also characteristic displaced vertices could be probed. By extending
these models by new scalars and fermions, either the resonant enhancement takes
place or an additional contribution to the neutrino mass generations mechanism is
added. This leads to a separation between the scales of leptogenesis and neutrino
mass generation, and opens up a new versatile phenomenology and testability.

We then focused on leptogenesis generated by seesaw models involving an ex-
tended gauge sector. In Sec. 5.1, we discussed (resonant) U (1)(cid:48) models. Here, LHC
bounds already strongly constrain the mass of the Z (cid:48) (MZ(cid:48) > 3.7 TeV) and thus the
corresponding heavy neutrino mass. Observation of large CP violation in same-sign
di-lepton ﬁnal states at the LHC would be a hint for this scenario. Another popular
scenario is the L-R symmetric model, which was reviewed in Sec. 5.2. With the
mass of the WR being constrained to be above 10 TeV in order to have successful
leptogenesis, it is diﬃcult to test this scenario. Thus, we discussed to which extent
it is possible to falsify this model if a WR with a mass below 10 TeV were to be
discovered at the LHC.

We further reviewed supersymmetric leptogenesis models. While the direct
probe of type I soft leptogenesis with generic trilinear couplings by the observation
of heavy sneutrinos is not forseeable in the future, possible signiﬁcant contributions

82

to CLFV processes are close to sensitivities of present and future experiments. This
was discussed in Sec. 6.1. As shown in Sec. 6.2, also in type II soft leptogenesis
the heavy neutrinos are too heavy to be probed directly. However, signatures of
doubly charged bosons decaying into same-sign leptons at the LHC are an indicator
for this scenario, as well as a same-sign tetra-lepton signal from triplet-antitriplet
oscillations.

Being unable to probe high-scale models directly at current experiments, we
reviewed in Sec. 7 the possibility to falsify high-scale leptogenesis by the observation
of ∆L = 2 washout processes. We demonstrated that the observation of pp
→
(cid:96)±(cid:96)±qq without missing energy at the LHC would imply the falsiﬁcation of certain
high-scale models. Similarly, the observation of 0νββ by a non-standard operator
would point us towards a low-scale leptogenesis model.

Generally, we could show that common experimental and theoretical eﬀort are

underlying mechanism responsible for the generation of the observed cosmic baryon
asymmetry.
