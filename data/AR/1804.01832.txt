Abstract

Fragment mass distributions from ﬁssion of excited compound nucleus 178Pt have been deduced from the measured fragment
velocities. The 178Pt nucleus was created at the JAEA tandem facility in a complete fusion reaction 36Ar + 142Nd, at beam energies
of 155, 170 and 180 MeV. The data are indicative of a mixture of the mass-asymmetric and mass-symmetric ﬁssion modes asso-
ciated with higher and lower total kinetic energies of the fragments, respectively. The measured fragment yields are dominated by
asymmetric mass splits, with the symmetric mode contributing at the level of ≈ 1/3. This constitutes the ﬁrst observation of a mul-
timodal ﬁssion in the sub-lead region. Most probable experimental fragment-mass split of the asymmetric mode, AL/AH ≈ 79/99,
is well reproduced by nuclear density functional theory using the UNEDF1-HFB and D1S potentials. The symmetric mode is as-
sociated by theory with very elongated ﬁssion fragments, which is consistent with the observed total kinetic energy/fragment mass
correlation.

1. Introduction

Understanding of the nuclear ﬁssion process is important for
many areas of fundamental science, technology, and medicine.
In particular, ﬁssion is crucial for the existence of many
transuranium nuclei, including the predicted long-lived super-
heavy isotopes [1], as well as for the heavy element formation
in the astrophysical r-process [2–5]. Better knowledge of ﬁs-
sion properties is also essential for our understanding of the
antineutrino ﬂux from nuclear reactors [6, 7]. Regardless of the
area, one needs detailed information on ﬁssion rates and ﬁssion
fragment (FF) mass distributions (FFMDs).

At present, our experimental knowledge of ﬁssion is pri-
marily limited to nuclei close to the stability line [8, 9] and
within a fairly narrow isospin range N/Z ∼ 1.48 − 1.58. Ex-
trapolation of this knowledge to higher neutron-excess regions
(N/Z > 1.8) relevant to the r-process is highly model depen-
dent [2, 4, 5]. While there has been exciting progress in global
modeling of nuclear properties, facilitated by advanced com-
puting, a comprehensive, microscopic explanation of nuclear
ﬁssion is still diﬃcult to achieve, due to complexity of the pro-

cess [10, 11]. To advance theoretical modeling of ﬁssion, ex-
perimental FFMDs data are needed in broader range of N/Z-
values, to test the isospin dependence of model predictions.

Due to its experimental accessibility, the neutron-deﬁcient
sub-lead region (N/Z ∼ 1.3) provides excellent testing ground
for studies of the isospin dependence of ﬁssion observables.
Due to exotic N/Z ratio, new facets of ﬁssion process can
be expected.
Indeed, the observation of asymmetric ﬁssion
of 178,180Hg [12, 13] attributed to shell eﬀects in pre-scission
conﬁgurations [14–17] has generated an appreciable interest
in this region, both experimentally and theoretically. Inspired
by the 180Hg results, FFMDs have been experimentally studied
for several neutron-deﬁcient sub-lead nuclei [13, 18–20]. As
shown by theory [14–16, 21–24], the topology of potential en-
ergy surfaces (PES) in sub-lead nuclei is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
(ﬂat, broad and rather structureless) from those in the actinides,
which explains fairly low dependence of the corresponding ex-
perimental FFMDs on the compound nucleus (CN) excitation
energy (cf. [18]). According to the global survey of FFMDs
[25], a new extended region of asymmetric ﬁssion is expected in
neutron-deﬁcient Re-Pb isotopes with 98 (cid:54) N (cid:54) 116. It is sep-
arated from predominanly asymmetrically-ﬁssioning actinides
by a zone of symmetric ﬁssion around Ir-At in the vicinity of
N ∼ 120–126 [8], whose properties were extensively investi-

gated in the past (cf., e.g., Refs. [26, 27]). The experimentally
studied neutron-deﬁcient 178,180,182,190,195Hg and 179,189Au iso-
topes [12, 13, 18–20] lie on the northern border of this region.
As concluded in Ref. [25], new high-quality FFMDs data for
selected sub-lead isotopes are needed to test and guide theoret-
ical developments.

In the transitional regions between asymmetrically and sym-
metrically ﬁssoning sub-lead nuclei, an interplay between dif-
ferent ﬁssion modes might exist, by analogy to light [28, 29]
and heavy [30, 31] actinides.
In view of PES properties in
the sub-lead region [12, 14–16], an observation of a compe-
tition between ﬁssion modes will shed light on the nature of
near-scission conﬁgurations of nuclei, which are some 60 nu-
cleons lighter and greatly deﬁcient in neutrons, as compared to
actinides and transactinides. This Letter provides the ﬁrst ex-
perimental demonstration of the existence of competing ﬁssion
modes in sub-lead nuclei, by revealing the presence of asym-
metric and symmetric ﬁssion modes through measurements of
FFMDs from ﬁssion of 178Pt.

2. Experiment

178Pt was produced at the JAEA tandem accelerator [32] in a
complete fusion reaction 36Ar + 142Nd → 178Pt∗. A 75 µg/cm2-
thick 142Nd target was made by sputtering of the 142NdF3 ma-
terial (isotopically enriched to 99%) onto a thin (42 µg/cm2)
carbon backing facing the beam. Stability of the target per-
formance with irradiation time was conﬁrmed by the measure-
ments of the 36Ar ions scattered into a Si detector placed at
backward angles, as well as by the constancy (within every
beam energy setting) of the counting rate monitored during the
experiment. The 36Ar beam intensity was a few pnA, and the
measurements were performed at three beam-energy settings
(155, 170, and 180 MeV). Table 1 gives details on the energy
balance of the formed CN.

The coincident ﬁssion fragments of 178Pt were detected with
a two-arm time-of-ﬂight (TOF) setup placed downstream the
target, with two TOF arms positioned symmetrically at ±60◦
relative to the beam axis, with horizontal and vertical accep-
tance of ±15◦. The chosen detection angles allowed for sim-
ilar angular acceptance for both mass-symmetric and mass-
asymmetric ﬁssion events and, thus, excluded inﬂuence of the
setup geometry on the observed ﬁssion properties. Each TOF
arm was comprised of a micro-channel plate based detector
(MCP) and a position-sensitive multi-wire proportional counter
(MWPC), providing the timing START and STOP signals. For
the central trajectory, the target–MCP foil distance was 67 mm,
and the TOF base of 243 mm was identical for the two TOF
arms. The MWPCs (active area of 200 × 200 mm2) were op-
erated with isobutane gas at a pressure of 1.5 Torr and had a
2 µm aluminum-coated Mylar entrance window, whereas the
MCP-based detectors were equipped with a thin (0.5 µm) My-
lar foil coated with Au and CsI (100Å and 20Å of thickness,
respectively). In addition to timing signals and spacial coordi-
nates for the detected events, the MWPCs have also provided
information on their partial energy loss in the isobutane.

3. Results

Figures 1a-b give samples of recorded coincident data, in
which experimental observables (timing signals and energies)
are used without any preliminary treatment. Three groups of
events are distinctly visible in the plots. Their identiﬁcation as
projectile/target scattering and ﬁssion events is obvious directly
from the plotted raw data.

For the follow-up analysis, we select ﬁssion events by mak-
ing use of two conditions on the observables, indicated in
Figs 1a-b as contours 1. Angular information extracted from
the MWPC impact coordinates (folding angles: see Ref. [18]
for details) was used to check for the selection quality.

For every identiﬁed ﬁssion event, velocities of coincident FFs
were derived from the measured TOF values and TOF distances
calculated with help of the MWPC coordinates. They were then
calibrated with the scattered 36Ar beam and corrected for the
reaction kinematics, as well as for attenuation in the target (cal-
culated for a half of the tickness) and the TOF detectors’ foils.

remaining events are from the projectile-target scattering. (b) Summed energy
signals from the MWPC detectors for Ebeam = 170 MeV plotted against the dif-
ference in their timing signals (coincidence with MCPs not demanded). Con-
toured are ﬁssion events producing more ionization in detectors, due to their
signiﬁcantly larger ionic charge states and, hence, higher eﬀective charges that

tered 36Ar beam, corrected for attenuation in the target and TOF detectors. The
inset shows a typical (free) ﬁt of the data at Ebeam = 170 MeV. (d) Events from
(a) represented in terms of their total kinetic energy and mass both calculated
from experimentally obtained velocities, assuming ﬁssion process as the only
events’ origin. Group of events in the plot’s center is coincident with data in
contours in (a) and (b).

1 An alternative approach for the ﬁssion event selection is to extract from the
measured data masses and total kinetic energies and to construct a correspond-
ing correlation plot, as shown in Fig. 1d. This analysis does not necessitate any
prior gating but uses commont treatment (two-body ﬁssion kinematics) for all
of the measured events. The approach does not work if not ﬁssion but (elastic)
scattering is assumed as the only origin of the detected events.

Figure 1c shows the obtained FF velocities for one of the
TOF arms. The striking feature of these distributions is their
pronounced non-symmetric character. A good description of
the velocity spectra is achieved with a two-Gaussian ﬁt, as
demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 1c. The asymmetry in the
velocity spectra allows one to conclude that the ﬁssion of 178Pt
produces fragments with diﬀerent masses and is therefore pre-
dominantly asymmetric.

Importanly, the two-component velocity ﬁts as in Fig. 1c de-
liver very diﬀerent distribution widths and thus do not yield
the same integral for the expected light and heavy fragment
groups. This is a direct indication of presence of symmetric-
ﬁssion events in the data.

The mass numbers AL and AH of light and heavy FF groups,
respectively, along with their respective total kinetic energy
(TKE), can be readily derived from the fragments’ velocities
vL and vH, under assumption of no particle emission (i.e.,
AL + AH = ACM) from the compound nucleus ACM during the
pre-ﬁssion stage: ALvL = AHvH and TKE = 0.5ACMvLvH. An
example of the deduced TKE-mass data is shown in Fig. 2b.
Projection of the data in Fig. 2b on the TKE-axis gives the
TKE distribution (Fig. 2a), whose average value TKE and width
σTKE are found to slightly change with the increasing beam en-
ergy (∆TKE = −1.9(2) MeV, ∆σTKE = 1.2(2) MeV for the
measured Ebeam range). This corraborates recent results on the
TKE parameters’ behaviour in 180,190Hg [18] and is generaly

The TKE distribution in Fig. 2a is clearly skewed. The sim-
ulated FF energy straggling in the target and TOF detectors’
foils could not reproduce the observed asymmetry eﬀect in the
TKE, unless unrealistic assumptions are made about the inho-
mogeneity of the MCP foil (thickness varying from zero till 10
times the nominal value of 0.5µm). Similarly-skewed TKE dis-
tributions were obtained also at Ebeam=155 and 180 MeV. Based
on the velocity analysis, an unconstrained two-Gaussian ﬁt was
carried out to describe the TKE data. This ﬁt, statistically re-
liable only at the two higher energies, yields two TKE compo-
nents placed at TKElow (maximum of the shadowed-area curve
in Fig. 2a) and TKEhigh (maximum of the other dashed curve);
their numerical values are given in Table 1.

The TKE components TKElow and TKEhigh are linked to the
symmetric and asymmetric ﬁssion modes. This is demonstrated

3

by the diﬀerence in the shape of the partial MDs constructed
with events in Fig. 2b in the regions below TKElow and above
TKEhigh and projected on the mass-axis (cf. the dotted lines and
arrows in the Figure): narow and clearly symmetric in Fig. 2d
and wide and ﬂat-top in Fig. 2c. The best-ﬁt desciptions of
partial MDs in Figs 2c-d are achieved with one- and two Gaus-
sians, respectively. The latter determines the light (AL=79(1)
amu) and heavy (AH=99(1) amu) FF peak positions. Thus, our
experimental results shown in Fig. 2c-d oﬀer the ﬁrst direct ex-
perimental evidence of the co-existing symmetric and asym-
metric ﬁssion modes in the 178Pt nucleus and in the sub-lead
region. Contrary to the Mulgin et al.
[37] who interpreted
earlier experimental data close to the β-stability line around
A∼200 [26, 27] within a liquid-drop model with phenomeno-
logical shell corrections added, our conclusion on the coexis-
tence of two modes in 178Pt is based on the assumption-free de-
convolution of experimental TKE-mass data which makes the
result unambiguous.

The experimental total FFMDs are shown in Figs. 2e-g by
the black circles. Solid red and dashed lines are results of the
analysis in terms of two ﬁssion modes, with the ﬁt function
composed of three Gaussians with ﬁxed positions as obtained
above. Overall, a good description of the experimental data is
achieved. The asymmetric mode is found to be dominant, in
accordance with the velocity analysis. The weight of the sym-
metric mode amounts to ∼31% at the three considered beam
energies. Thus, in contrast to actinides [36], the balance be-
tween symmetric and asymmetric modes in the FFMDs does
not seem to be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the excitation energy.
This can be explained in terms of the energy considerations of
Table 1: corrections to the excitation energy E∗

lations were performed in the collective space of quadrupole
(Q20) and octupole (Q30) moments, and also in the hexade-
capole direction Q40 in the D1S model.
It is encouraging to
see that both approaches yield very similar picture of PES.
In both calculations, the static ﬁssion path leads to the mass-
asymmetric AL/AH ≈80/98 split, which matches the experi-
mental result very well.
(We note that the Brownian shape-
motion method Ref. [25] predicts a strongly asymmetric split
with AL/AH ≈70/108 at the CN excitation energy of 16.5 MeV.)
To understand the formation of fragments corresponding to
the 178Pt ﬁssion pathways, we use the concept of nucleon lo-
calization functions (NLFs) [41]. Within this framework, the
elongated conﬁgurations on the way to scission are composed
of two clusters (pre-fragments) connected by a neck. At scis-
sion, the neck nucleons are redistributed into pre-fragments,
producing the ﬁnal ﬁssion fragments. As shown in Ref. [42],
NLFs quantify the appearance of pre-fragments more eﬃciently
than nucleonic density distributions as the concentric patterns in
NLFs – due to shell structure in the nuclear interior – are aver-
aged out in density distributions. Figure 3 displays the result-
ing NLFs along the two ﬁssion pathways: asymmetric (ABCD)
and symmetric (ABcd). Based on the analysis of NLFs accord-
ing to the procedure of Ref. [42], the asymmetric pre-scission
conﬁgurations marked “C” and “D” in Fig. 3 are composed of
a nearly-spherical cluster around 86Sr and a lighter deformed
pre-fragment. Such a structure results in FFs around 98Mo and
80Kr. As far as the symmetric conﬁguration “c” is concerned,
its pre-fragments can be associated with spherical 64Ni nuclei.
The static ﬁssion valley in Figs. 3 and 4 evolves on a fairly
ﬂat landscape, in contrast to a typical situation in heavy ac-
tinides (see e.g. [16, 22]). Absence of any ridge in the area of
low octupole moments, along with a fairly small energy diﬀer-

fragments, the neutron localization functions [41, 42] corresponding to various

paths are plotted.

ence between the asymmetric and symmetric paths, suggests a
possibility for a competition between diﬀerent ﬁssion modes.
At present, a detailed description of this competition is diﬃcult
to assess theoretically, as the post-scission conﬁgurations asso-
ciated with fusion valleys [15] enter the picture and produce a
sudden drop in PES at very large elongations (cf. Figs. 3 and
4a), which makes it practically impossible to follow adiabati-
cally the original ﬁssion trajectory.

A detailed analysis of the PES in Fig. 4b shows that the
plateau predicted for nearly-symmetric shapes around Q20 =
190 b in the region between the paths CD and cd, has a
rather complicated structure. Namely, at the same values of
quadrupole and octupole moments, two local symmetric PES
minima with similar energies but distinct hexadecapole mo-
ments and nuclear density distributions are found. One of these

while that with Q40 ≈ 85 b2 can be associated with very elon-
gated fragments. In both models, the symmetric pathway as-
sociated with elongated-fragment conﬁgurations, expected to
have lower TKE, is predicted to be energetically slightly more
favored than that associated with compact fragments. There-
fore, it cannot be excluded that the symmetric ﬁssion mode seen
experimentally contains contributions from both structures. It
is interesting to see that competing ﬁssion pathways involving
similarly asymmetric, compact, or elongated shapes have been
predicted for multimodally ﬁssioning nuclei in the fermium re-
gion [43, 44], i.e., for nuclei with much larger values of ACN
and N/Z.

at Q20 = 190 b (b) obtained in D1S. The solid thick line in (a) indicates the
static ﬁssion path obtained by the local minimization of PES. Dashed lines in
(b) indicate the symmetric PESs corresponding to compact (smaller Q40) and
elongated (larger Q40) fragments. The minimum corresponding to the static
ﬁssion path in (a) is marked by the red dot.

Experimentally, we ﬁnd that both symmetric and asymmetric
ﬁssion modes follow the trend previously observed in heavier,
trans-lead, nuclei [45]. In particular, higher values of TKE in
the asymmetric mode (cf. Table 1) – which also match well
the TKE=135.9 MeV value expected from the Viola systemat-
ics [46] – are indicative of less deformed scission conﬁgura-
tions, whereas for the symmetric mode, highly elongated FF
shapes are expected from its lower TKE values. This ﬁnding
is consistent with the shapes of nucleon localizations shown in
Fig. 3: symmetric conﬁguration “d” corresponds to highly de-
formed fragments without a well deﬁned neck. As discussed
above, a similar conﬁguration associated with symmetric elon-
gated fragments has been predicted in the D1S model: in Fig. 4b
it is marked by a black dot at Q40 ≈ 85 b2 and Q30 ≈ 0.

5. Conclusions

Moreover, its average TKE follows the systematics [46] estab-
lished for nuclei with N/Z ∼ 1.5, which suggests the asym-
metric mode’s insensitivity to the isospin of the CN, at least for
ACN > 177.

The UNEDF1-HFB and D1S calculations support the expri-
mental results. Namely, they correctly reproduce the measured
mass division associated with the dominant asymmetric ﬁssion
mode, and they predict highly elongated pre-scission conﬁgura-
tions along the symmetric ﬁssion path, which is in accordance
with the lower experimental TKE value for this mode.

The present work provides new experimental information on
the extension of the recently-discovered island of asymmetric
ﬁssion towards lower atomic numbers. For the ﬁrst time, the in-
terplay between diﬀerent ﬁssion modes has been found in a nu-
cleus from the sub-lead region. The result provides strong mo-
tivation for extending microscopic models of ﬁssion to FFMDs
and TKE distributions at nonzero excitation energies. Finally,
beyond-DFT extensions of the current formalism are needed, as
the PESs predicted for pre-lead nuclei are generally very ﬂat in
the pre-scission region, resulting in possible interferences be-
tween asymmetric and symmetric ﬁssion modes.

In summary, the FFMDs of 178Pt produced in a complete
fusion reaction 36Ar + 142Nd are found to be predominantly
asymmetric, with the most probable mass division AL ≈ 79
and AH ≈ 99. The combined analysis of the FFMDs and TKE
distributions made it possible to separate asymmetric and sym-
metric ﬁssion modes. It is found that the asymmetric mode is
associated with larger TKE values than the symmetric mode.
