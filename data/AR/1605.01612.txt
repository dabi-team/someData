ABSTRACT
The CHemical Abundances of Spirals (CHAOS) project leverages the combined power of the Large
Binocular Telescope (LBT) with the broad spectral range and sensitivity of the Multi Object Double
Spectrograph (MODS) to measure “direct” abundances (based on observations of the temperature-
sensitive auroral lines) in large samples of H II regions in spiral galaxies. We present LBT MODS
observations of 109 Hii regions in NGC 5457 (M 101), of which 74 have robust measurements of key
auroral lines (50 [O III] λ4363, 47 [N II] λ5755, 59 [S III] λ6312, 67 [O II] λλ7320, 7330 and 70 [S II]
λ4076 at a strength of ≥ 3 σ), a factor of ∼3 larger than all previous published detections of auroral
lines in the Hii regions of NGC 5457. Comparing the temperatures derived from the diﬀerent ionic
species we ﬁnd: (1) strong correlations of T[N ii] with T[S iii] and T[O iii], consistent with little or no
intrinsic scatter; (2) a correlation of T[S iii] with T[O iii], but with signiﬁcant intrinsic dispersion; (3)
overall agreement between T[N ii], T[S ii], and T[O ii], as expected, but with signiﬁcant outliers; (4)
the correlations of T[N ii] with T[S iii] and T[O iii] match the predictions of photoionization modeling
while the correlation of T[S iii] with T[O iii] is oﬀset from the prediction of photoionization modeling.
Based on these observations, which include signiﬁcantly more observations of lower excitation Hii
regions, missing in many analyses, we inspect the commonly used ionization correction factors (ICFs)
for unobserved ionic species and propose new empirical ICFs for S and Ar. We have discovered an
unexpected population of H II regions with a signiﬁcant oﬀset to low values in Ne/O, which deﬁes
explanation. We derive radial gradients in O/H and N/O which agree with previous studies. Our
large observational database allows us to examine the dispersion in abundances, and we ﬁnd intrinsic
dispersions of 0.074 ± 0.009 in O/H and 0.095 ± 0.009 in N/O (at a given radius). We stress that this
measurement of the intrinsic dispersion comes exclusively from direct measurements of Hii regions in
NGC 5457.

INTRODUCTION
1.1. CHAOS
As the dominant sites of current star formation, nearby
spiral galaxies provide the best laboratories for under-
standing the star formation process. Presently we are
secure in our knowledge of several properties of present
day spiral galaxies. Over the past decades, the mor-
phological sequence identiﬁed by Hubble and contem-
poraries has become understood as a sequence in both
mass and gas content (e.g., Blanton & Moutakas 2009).
The more actively star forming galaxies are generally of
lower mass and higher gas content, indicating that the
eﬃciency of star formation is related to the mass sur-
face density of galaxies. We also know that the vast
majority of spiral galaxies show a correlation between
their luminosities and the abundance of heavy elements
in their interstellar media (e.g., Shields 1990). The dis-
persion in this correlation is markedly smaller when one
plots heavy element abundance versus stellar mass, indi-
cating that it is the mass of the galaxy that drives this
correlation (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004). Additionally, the
chemical abundances of spiral galaxies are known to show
radial gradients (e.g., Pagel & Edmunds 1981). While

this ﬁrst-order description of present day spiral galaxies
is secure, there are important aspects, in particular re-
garding their chemical evolution, that are, simply put,
unknown. These missing details are preventing us from
understanding key processes in the evolution of galaxies.
While numerous spectra of star forming galaxies have
been obtained through large surveys such as SDSS
(Tremonti et al. 2004), PINGS (Rosales-Ortega et al.
2010), CALIFA (Marino et al. 2013), MaNGA (Bundy
et al. 2015; Law et al. 2015), and SAMI (Bryant et al.
2015) few of these observations enable direct determi-
nations of absolute gas-phase abundances, as they do
not detect the faint auroral lines that reveal the elec-
tron temperatures of the Hii regions. Even determining
the relative abundances can be challenging given possi-
ble biases, both in the observations and the methodol-
ogy of determining gas-phase metallicity using only the
brightest lines (Kewley & Ellison 2008). Furthermore,
the coarse spatial resolution that results from observing
distant galaxies means that non-homogenous clouds of
gas will co-inhabit each spectrum (Moustakas & Kenni-
cutt 2006).

Assembling very high quality spectra of Hii regions
in spiral galaxies, which allow accurate determinations

Croxall et al.

of absolute and relative abundances, reveals the com-
plex nature of understanding chemical evolution across
a broad range of parameter space. Observations of HII
regions in spiral galaxies indicate that multiple tempera-
ture diagnostics are useful when attempting to under-
stand the ionization structure of nebulae (Berg et al.
2015). Failure to measure multiple ionic temperatures,
in cases with single discrepant temperatures or system-
atic biases, can lead to an increased apparent dispersion
in the chemical abundances at a given radius, and in-
creased dispersions can result in an artiﬁcial ﬂattening
of gradients.

We recognize that having a direct abundance is not
the ﬁnal word on abundances and that systemic eﬀects
can exist for direct abundances also (e.g., Peimbert 1967;
Stasi´nska 2005). However, we believe that obtaining a
very large sample of direct abundance is our best chance
to assess the possible systematics in the direct abun-
dances.

1.2. NGC5457 / M101
The nearly face-on spiral galaxy NGC 5457 (also known
as M 101) presents numerous luminous Hii regions for ob-
servation.
In a seminal study, Kennicutt et al. (2003)
measured direct oxygen abundances in 20 Hii regions
spanning the optical disk of NGC 5457, showing that
this galaxy exhibits a steep metallicity gradient. More
recently, Li et al. (2013) found indications of possible
azimuthal abundance variations via observation of nine
additional Hii regions between 0.55≤R/R25≤ 0.6 kpc.

While Kennicutt et al. (2003) found good agreement
between various ionic temperatures and the photoioniza-
tion models of Garnett (1992), a re-analysis of the re-
ported line ﬂuxes from Kennicutt et al. (2003), using up-
dated atomic data, ﬁnd possible disagreements between
these ionic temperatures (Berg et al. 2015). However,
we note that the [O iii] λ4363 and [N ii] λ5755 lines were
simultaneously detected in only 7 Hii regions. Including
regions from Li et al. (2013) does not clarify the situa-
tion, as their spectra do not extend redward of 5100˚A.
Furthermore, both of these studies primarily focus on
metal poor Hii regions where these discrepancies seem
to diminish (Binette et al. 2012). Accordingly, we are
able to use multiple emission line diagnostics to deter-
mine the physical conditions in the Hii regions and trace
disagreements between measured temperatures and pho-
toionization models, with a set goal of determining abso-
lute and relative chemical abundances with uncertainties
<0.1 dex.

Here we present observations taken with the Multi-
Object Double Spectrographs (MODS, Pogge et al. 2010)
on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). With these ob-
servations we increase the number of direct oxygen abun-
dance measurements in NGC 5457 by a factor of ∼3. This
will enable a broader study of possible extra-radial vari-
ations in abundance.

We have observed Hii regions in NGC 5457 as part of
CHAOS to increase the number of auroral line detections,
to investigate multiple means of determining the electron
temperature in metal-rich galaxies, and to verify its ab-
solute metallicity gradient. Our observations and data
reduction are described in §2. In §3 we determine elec-
tron temperatures and direct gas-phase chemical abun-

dances. We present abundance gradients for O/H and
N/O in §4. We discuss these abundance gradients and
the azmuthal patterns of chemical evolution in §5. Fi-
nally, we summarize our conclusions in §6.

2. OBSERVATIONS
2.1. Optical Spectroscopy
Optical spectra of NGC 5457 were taken using MODS
on the LBT during the spring semester of 2015. All spec-
tra were acquired with the MODS1 unit. We obtained
simultaneous blue and red spectra using the G400L (400
lines mm−1, R≈1850) and G670L (250 lines mm−1,
R≈2300) gratings, respectively. This setup provided
broad spectral coverage extending from 3200 – 10,000 ˚A.
In order to detect the intrinsically weak auroral lines,
i.e., [O iii] λ4363, [N ii] λ5755, and [S iii] λ6312, in nu-
merous Hii regions, 13 ﬁelds were targeted; seven using
multi-object masks and six using the 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)2 facility long-
slit mask. The individual ﬁeld masks were cut such that
∼15–20 spectra, including both Hii regions and sky-slits,
were simultaneously obtained. We obtained multiple ex-
posures of 1200s for each ﬁeld. For multi-object masks
we obtained six exposures, for a total integration time
of 2-hours for each; long-slit targets were typically lumi-
nous, massive Hii regions and thus were only observed
with between three and ﬁve exposures each, depending
on the cloud cover at the time of observations.

Figure 1 shows the locations of slits overlaid on an Hα
map of NGC 5457. Throughout this work, we label all
locations as oﬀsets, in right ascension and declination,
from the center of NGC 5457, as listed in Table 1. We
obtained our observations when NGC 5457 was at rela-
tively low airmass, typically ∼1.2. We also cut our slits
close to the median parallactic angle of the observing
window. The combination of low airmass and matching
the parallactic angle minimizes ﬂux lost due to diﬀeren-
tial atmospheric refraction between 3200 – 10,000 ˚A(cf.
Filippenko 1982).

Our targeted regions (see Table 5), as well as align-
ment stars, were selected based on archival broad-band
and Hα imaging (Hoopes et al. 2001). We cut most slits
to be ∼15(cid:48)(cid:48) long with a 1(cid:48)(cid:48) slit width. Slits were placed
on relatively bright Hii regions across the entirety of the
disk; this ensured that both radial and azimuthal trends
in the abundances could be investigated. When extra
space between slits was available, slits were extended to
make the best use of the available ﬁeld of view. As the
bright disk of NGC 5457 complicates local sky subtrac-
tion, we also cut sky-slits in each mask that provided a
basis for clean sky subtraction.

For a detailed description of the data reduction pro-
cedures we refer the reader to Berg et al. (2015). We
only note here the primary points of our data pro-
cessing. Spectra were reduced and analyzed using the
development version of the MODS reduction pipeline1
which runs within the XIDL2 reduction package. One-
dimensional spectra were corrected for atmospheric ex-
tinction and ﬂux calibrated based on observations of ﬂux
standard stars (Bohlin 2010). At least one ﬂux standard
was observed on each night science data were obtained.

An example of a ﬂux-calibrated spectrum is shown in
Figure 2. Given that each light path traversed diﬀerent
physical portions of the dichroic, we extract a 1D ﬂat
spectrum for each object and subsequently correct the
ﬂux calibration of each spectrum individually using the
ratio of the local ﬂat spectrum and the ﬂat spectrum
extracted at the position of the standard star.

While many Hii regions exist in the central region of
NGC 5457, we chose to observe a few of these regions
in multiple masks. This serves to conﬁrm that our cali-
brations as stable and robust against changing observing
conditions and permits us to obtain even deeper spectra
in metal rich regions near the center of NGC 5457 where
the innate weakness of the auroral lines makes them diﬃ-
cult to detect. For regions with coverage in multiple slit
masks, in general, we coadd individual ﬂux calibrated
spectra to create the ﬁnal spectrum.
In two cases we
did not coadd all the spectra as some were clearly more
noisy. In all cases, analyses of the individual spectra are
consistent with the summed spectrum.

We provide a detailed description of the adopted con-
tinuum modeling and line ﬁtting procedures applied to
the CHAOS observations in Berg et al. (2015). Here we
will only highlight the principle components of the pro-
cess. We model the underlying stellar continuum using
the STARLIGHT3 spectral synthesis code (Cid Fernan-
des et al. 2005) in conjunction with the models of Bruzual
& Charlot (2003). This allows us to ﬁt for stellar absorp-
tion which is blended with the observed ﬁne-structure
lines.

Allowing for an additional faint nebular continuum,
modeled as a linear component, we ﬁt Gaussian proﬁles
to each emission line. We note that blended emission
lines in the Balmer sequence at the blue end of the spec-
trum (H7, H8, and H11 – H14) are not ﬁt but are modeled
based on the measurements of unblended Balmer lines
and the tabulated atomic ratios of Hummer & Storey
(1987), assuming Case B recombination. As the line
proﬁles are not perfect Gaussian’s, we subsequently use
the modeled baselines and positions to integrate under
the continuum subtracted spectrum, for all non-blended
lines. In general, the diﬀerence between the ﬂux returned
by a Gaussian ﬁt and direct integration is less than 2%
of the line ﬂux.

Given that precise measurements of the auroral lines
are vital to this study, we measured the ﬂux of each au-
roral line by hand in the extracted spectra to conﬁrm the
ﬁt. While the majority of measurements were found to
be in agreement, in cases where these measurements were
in disagreement, we adopted the by hand measurement.
This was most common for the [N ii] λ5755 line which
falls in the wavelength region aﬀected by the dichroic
cutoﬀ of MODS and the continuum here is not always
well ﬁt by the modeled starlight and the resultant ﬁt
was thus inadequate.

Fig. 2.— Example of a one dimensional spectrum taken from MODS1 observations of NGC 5457, namely NGC5457+667.9+174.1. Notable
major emission features are marked and labeled. We have not corrected for major telluric absorption features.

We correct the strength of emission features for line-of-
sight reddening using the relative intensities of the three
strongest Balmer lines (Hα/Hβ, Hα/Hγ, Hβ/Hγ). We
report the determined values of c(Hβ) in Table 6 (the
full table is available online). We do not apply an ad-
hoc correction to account for Balmer absorption as the
lines were ﬁt on top of stellar population models that ac-
counted for this feature. We note that the stellar models
contain stellar absorption with an equivalent width of
≈1 – 2 ˚A in the Hβ line. We report reddening-corrected
line intensities measured from Hii regions in the target
ﬁelds in Table 6.

The uncertainty associated with each measurement is
determined from measurements of the spectral variance,
extracted from the two-dimensional variance image, Pois-
son noise in the continuum, read noise, sky noise, ﬂat
ﬁelding calibration error, error in continuum placement,
and error in the determination of the reddening. We
add, in quadrature, an additional 2% uncertainty based
on the precision of the adopted ﬂux calibration standards
(Bohlin 2010, see discussion in Berg et al. 2015).

2.3. Diagnostic Diagrams
We targeted Hii regions using narrowband Hα imaging
which was continuum subtracted. While Hα is prominent
in the ionized gas of an Hii region, other objects besides

Hii regions can also produce such emission. For exam-
ple, planetary nebulae and supernovae remnants can be
targeted based on the presence of ionized gas. To verify
that we are measuring lines from photoionized Hii re-
gions, we inspected standard diagnostic diagrams (Bald-
win, Phillips, & Terlevich 1981, BPT): [O iii]/Hβ versus
[N ii]/Hα, [S II]/Hα, and [O I]/Hα, and ionization pa-
rameter P versus R23, where

that stand out in both [S II]/Hα and [O I]/Hα relative to
[O iii]/Hβ. We have performed our analysis both includ-
ing and excluding these data and found they alter neither
the conclusions nor the ﬁts to the abundance trends.

We also note that three regions, NGC5457-12.3-271.1,
NGC5457-219.4+308.7, and NGC5457-167.8+321.5, lie

oﬀset from the trend of ionization parameter with R23
in the sense of a low ionization parameter for the given
R23. However, all other line diagnostics for these three
regions are normal, and the spectra do not stand out as
unusual. Therefore, we include these regions in our ﬁts.

3. GAS-PHASE ABUNDANCES
The ability to determine an elemental abundance from
an emission spectrum is dependent on knowledge of (1)
the electron density (ne), (2) the electron temperature
(Te), and (3) a correction factor for unobserved ionic
states. Observationally, the challenge is to detect the
intrinsically faint auroral lines which, when paired with
their stronger ionic counterparts, are sensitive to elec-
tron temperature (e.g., see Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).
Lacking detections of these lines, one must turn to indi-
rect methods, wherein measurements of the strong-lines
have been calibrated either empirically or via photoion-
ization modeling (e.g., Edmunds & Pagel 1984). In cal-
culating temperatures and abundances we have adopted
the updated atomic data presented in Berg et al. (2015).

region, depending on the energy needed to excite the

temperature scales. We have chosen to represent
the temperature structure of an Hii region with a
three-zone model. The diﬀerent zones are characterized

transitions, and thus present

[S iii],

One primary reason we selected NGC 5457 for this
study was the large number of bright Hii regions that
enhance the likelihood that multiple auroral lines will
be detected in any given Hii region. Indeed, the ability
to compare multiple temperature measures for a given
Hii region allows us to compare the diﬀerent tempera-
ture scales. Previous investigations of these relations has
found very good agreement between the photoionization
models of Garnett (1992), namely,

T[S III] = 0.83T[O III] + 0.17 (104K),

T[N II] = T[O II] = 0.70T[O III] + 0.3 (104K),

(4)

and the empirically measured temperatures from multi-
ple ions (e.g., Kennicutt et al. 2003). In Croxall et al.
(2015) we found good agreement between T[S iii] and
T[N ii] in Hii regions in NGC 5194. However, no Hii re-
gions in that sample have measurements of T[O iii] with
which they may be compared. In Berg et al. (2015) we
detected both the [O iii] and [S iii] auroral lines in several
Hii regions. These showed an oﬀset relative to equation
(3) and signiﬁcant scatter, calling into question the rote

acceptance of T[O iii] as ground truth. Following our
practice in Berg et al. (2015) we adopt a theoretical ratio
of λ9532/λ9069 = 2.51 to correct for possible contami-
nation of the red end of the spectrum by atmospheric
absorption.

The sensitivity of MODS on LBT allows us to greatly
increase the number of regions used in a comparison of
electron temperatures, even while restricting ourselves
to a single galaxy, particularly when the selected galaxy
has numerous luminous Hii regions as is the case with
NGC 5457. As was noted in Berg et al. (2015), the
current atomic data lead to signiﬁcant changes in the
temperatures derived from [S iii] and [O ii]. Given this
change in atomic data since the Garnett (1992) models
were run, changes in the resultant temperature relations
would not be unreasonable.

We plot the various temperature-temperature relations
in Figure 3. Linear regression ﬁts are computed using
the Bayesian method described by Kelly (2007) that ac-
counts for measurement errors in both variables and in-
cludes explicit ﬁtting for intrinsic scatter in the regres-
sion (see also Hogg et al. 2010, for a thorough discus-
sion of this ﬁtting problem in an astrophysical context).
This method models the intrinsic scatter in the inde-
pendent variables as a linear mixture of Gaussian dis-
tributions. We use J. Meyers Python-language imple-
mentation of Kellys original IDL code4 to perform the
calculations. This implementation uses a Markov chain
Monte-Carlo to compute 10000 samplings from the pos-
teriors. We adopt as the “best ﬁt” parameters the medi-
ans of the resulting marginal posterior distributions for
the slope, intercept, intrinsic scatter, and linear correla-
tion coeﬃcients, and evaluate the standard deviation of
these posterior distributions to estimate the uncertain-
ties for each ﬁt parameter. We show the resulting ﬁts as
solid black lines; we also include equations (3) and (4),
the relations derived from the photoionization models of
Garnett (1992), as dashed blue lines.

As can be seen in the top panel of Figure 3, we ﬁnd a
reasonable agreement with the models of Garnett (1992)
when comparing T[N ii] and T[S iii]. We do measure a
slight shift in both the slope and zero-point oﬀset in the
empirical relationship, compared to the result of com-
bining equations (3) and (4). However, these diﬀerences
are only at the one and two sigma level, respectively.
Furthermore, in the region where data exist, the two re-
lations show a striking similarity. These slight oﬀsets
are consistent with diﬀerences in atomic data we have
adopted compared to the atomic data used by Garnett
(1992).

In the middle panel of Figure 3 we show the relation-
ship between T[N ii] and T[O iii]. In this case we ﬁnd
agreement with the slope derived by Garnett (1992) and
only note a slight shift in the zero-point oﬀset of the re-
lationship. While the zero-point oﬀset is just over the
three sigma conﬁdence level it can be explained given
the diﬀerences in the adopted atomic data.

Similar to the results of Kennicutt et al. (2003), we ﬁnd
a good correlation between T[O iii] and T[S iii] in the
37 regions where both temperature sensitive line ratios
are measured, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure
3. However, in this case, we do not ﬁnd good agree-

Croxall et al.

ment with the models of Garnett (1992). Again, this
may, in part, also arise from the diﬀerent atomic data
adopted, however, the atomic data alone cannot explain
the diﬀerence. Rather, as shown in Figure 3 the empir-
ical relationship between these two ionic temperatures
is signiﬁcantly steeper than that given by equation (3).
This is particularly important for cool Hii regions where
the [S iii] auroral line is more frequently detected rela-
tive to the [O iii] auroral line.
Indeed, in the coolest
regions where the [S iii] λ6312 line is detected, the two
diﬀerent relations lead to temperatures that diﬀer by
more than 2,000 K. We also note that, in contrast with
what was seen in NGC 628 (Berg et al. 2015), the rela-
tionship between T[O iii] and T[S iii] is fairly tight with
a root-mean-square-deviation of ≈2200 K, compared to
the scatter we measure in the NGC 0628 data, ≈5000 K.
Nevertheless, we do note that there are Hii regions which
lie below this relation in the regime largely populated in
NGC 628.

Two Hii regions, NGC5457-397.4-71.7 and NGC5457-
226.9-366.4, exhibit anomalously high T[N ii] and have
been excluded from these ﬁts and plots. Kennicutt et al.
(2003) also noted some discrepant points when compar-
ing these two temperatures and concluded that unphys-
ically high T[N ii] were likely the result of marginally
detected lines. Careful investigation of our spectra do
not support a similar conclusion for our two discrepant
data points. Indeed, in the most discrepant of the two re-
gions, NGC5457-397.4-71.7, the [N ii] λ5755 line can be
seen in each of the six individual two dimensional im-
ages, ensuring it is not an anomalous measurement due
to contamination via cosmic rays. Rather these anoma-
lous temperatures likely indicate a complex environment
in these giant star-forming complexes. The existence of
such unusual temperature signatures can lead to highly
skewed results if only a single temperature measure is
observed for a given Hii region.

Given that we derive abundances using diﬀerent atomic
data from those used in the models of Garnett (1992), ap-
plying those temperature relations would introduce sys-
tematic oﬀsets. While previous data sets (e.g., Berg et al.
2015; Croxall et al. 2015) did not cover a large enough
range of parameter space to truly constrain empirical
temperature-temperature relations, the number of ob-
served Hii regions with multiple temperature measure-
ments and the steep oxygen gradient in NGC 5457 (Ken-
nicutt et al. 2003) result in the ideal uniform data set to
derive empirical temperature relations. We thus adopt
the empirical temperature relations ﬁt to CHAOS data
for which multiple auroral lines were detected in a single
region, namely:

T[N II] = 0.714 (±0.142)T[O III] + 0.257 (±0.125) (104K),
(5)
T[S III] = 1.312 (±0.075)T[N II] − 0.313 (±0.058) (104K),
(6)

and
T[S III] = 1.265 (±0.140)T[O III] − 0.232 (±0.135) (104K).
(7)
These empirical relations are consistent with intrinsic
dispersion of 280±140 K, 290±60 K, and 1,050±160 K re-
spectively. We adopt these values as lower limits for the
uncertainty of a temperature derived via these relations.

To ensure that we are not introducing additional bias in
our abundance determinations by adopting these tem-
perature relations we conﬁrm that oﬀsets from equations
(5) – (7) do not correlate with the oxygen ion fraction,
O+/O, or excitation.

In addition to measuring electron temperatures in each
ionization zone of our three-zone model, we also measure
three independent ionic ratios that characterize the low-
ionization zone, T[O ii], T[S ii], and T[N ii]. The stan-
dard practice is to adopt either one of the temperature-
temperature relations already discussed or to measure
T[N ii]. This has arisen due to a large amount of scatter
in T[O ii] and the relative weakness of the [S ii] auro-
ral lines. The increased dispersion in T[O ii], compared
to other measurements of electron temperature, has also
been attributed to contributions from direct dielectric
recombinations to the 2P 0 level, from which the auro-
ral lines arise (Rubin 1986). Furthermore, in the case
of T[O ii] underlying telluric absorption, proximity of
strong OH Meinel band emission, possible contribution
due to recombination (Liu et al. 2000), and a susceptibil-
ity of [O ii] to collisional de-excitation complicate tem-
perature measurements from [O ii] lines. Additionally
the temperature sensitive line ratios for [O ii] and [S ii]
are separated by ≈3,600 ˚A and ≈2,600 ˚A, respectively,
making them more sensitive to the eﬀects of reddening.
Our measurements of T[O ii], T[S ii], and T[N ii] do
indeed suggest that they largely arise from a common
ionization zone.
In Figure 4 we plot the measured
T[O ii] (Top) and T[S ii] (Bottom) against the measured
T[N ii]for Hii regions where both respective sets of auro-
ral lines were measured. While there is noticeable scatter
about the one-to-one relation, with intrinsic dispersions
of ≈900 K for T[S ii] and ≈1,100 K for T[O ii], the three
temperatures are clearly correlated and suggest that the
three ions are roughly measuring the electron tempera-
ture in an equivalent volume of gas. While an exhaustive
investigation of the [O ii] and [S ii] lines is not the pur-
pose of this paper, we have looked for possible trends
in the deviations of T[O ii] and T[S ii] from T[N ii]. We
do not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant correlations with a variety of
parameters such as the ionization parameters and red-
dening coeﬃcient that might be expected given previous
explanations of this scatter. Notably, restricting the sam-
ple to only the highest signal to noise detections does not
decrease the scatter between these three temperatures.

3.2. Comparison with Previous Work
Electron temperatures have previously been reported
in a signiﬁcant number of Hii regions in NGC 5457, mak-
ing it a useful benchmark test for the CHAOS program.
Notably, we have signiﬁcant overlap with the samples of
Kennicutt et al. (2003) (14/20 regions), Bresolin (2007)
(2/2 regions), and Li et al. (2013) (6/10 regions). Given
that we adopt slightly diﬀerent atomic data (Berg et al.
2015), we take their reported line measurements and re-
compute electron temperatures and abundances.

In Figure 5, we compare the derived electron temper-
atures from the line measurements reported in Kenni-
cutt et al. (2003), Bresolin (2007), and Li et al. (2013)
with those reported here. As can be seen, the calcu-
lated temperatures lie close to a one-to-one relation for
all three ions used to independently derive the temper-

more diﬃcult to detect. This is reﬂected in the larger
errors in the warmer Hii regions. Indeed, in two regions,
NGC5457-371.1-280.0 (H143) and NGC5457-368.3-285.6
(H149), Kennicutt et al. (2003) adopt signiﬁcantly lower
temperatures for the low ionization region based on tem-
peratures derived from the [O iii] measurements. We do
not plot these two regions in the right panel of Figure
5; however, we note that while their measured T[N ii]
is highly discrepant from ours, their adopted value is in
agreement with our measurements.

In addition to electron temperatures, we report line
strengths and the recomputed oxygen, nitrogen, and sul-
fur abundances for Hii regions measured in the litera-

ture and our newly obtained data in Table 2.
eral, we ﬁnd very good agreement between the abun-
dances derived from reported line strengths in Kennicutt
et al. (2003), Bresolin (2007), and Li et al. (2013) and
those presented in this work, with an average diﬀerence
in 12+log(O/H) and log(N/O) of 0.02 dex and 0.08 re-

spectively.

While most Hii regions we have in common with
previous
reported studies are in agreement within
the stated errors, two regions exhibit signiﬁcant de-
viations.
Comparing abundance determinations in
NGC 5457+354.1+71.2 and NGC 5457-75.0+29.3 reveals
that our new line measurements yield gas-phase oxygen
abundances that are discrepant at the level of 0.25 dex,
well above the stated errors, compared to recomputed
abundances. However, the recomputed abundances are
also not in agreement with the original computed abun-
dances. In the case of NGC 5457+354.1+71.2, Kennicutt
et al. (2003) do not adopt the temperature derived from
the [O iii] λ4363 line. Rather, they adopt a signiﬁcantly
lower temperature for this Hii region, which places it
in agreement with our CHAOS observations. On the
other hand the individual electron temperatures derived
for NGC 5457-75.0+29.3 are all in agreement, while spe-
ciﬁc ionic abundances seem to be highly discrepant. The
large diﬀerences for the recomputed abundances in these
two regions could easily be due to typographical errors
in the published tables of line strengths, so we compare
our CHAOS data with the published abundances from
the original works.

3.3. Electron Densities and Temperature Selections
To calculate abundances in regions where one or
more temperature sensitive line ratios were measured,
we adopt an electron density, ne, based on the
[S ii] λ6717/6731 line ratio as these relatively strong lines
are cleanly separated in MODS1 spectra. The large ma-
jority of Hii regions observed, 95 out of 109, lie in the low-
density regime [I(λ6717)/I(λ6731) > 1.35]. For these re-
gions we thus adopt an ne of 100 cm−3. For the remaining
14 regions we calculate electron densities using a ﬁve level
atom code based on FIVEL (De Robertis et al. 1987), see
Table 7. Although these regions have densities that are
higher than the low density limit, they are all still low
enough that collisional de-excitation is not an important
factor. We note that the [O ii] λλ3726,3729 doublet is
blended for all observations; however, in the majority of
spectra, the doublet proﬁle is clearly non-Gaussian. We
have modeled this doublet using two Gaussian proﬁles,
for use primarily as a consistency check of the [S ii] den-
sity determination. For all calculations aside from this
density check, we sum the ﬂux in the [O ii] λλ3726, 3729
doublet.

In regions where we have measured T[O iii], T[S iii],
and T[N ii], we adopt the measured temperatures for
each individual ionization zone when calculating abun-
dances. When one or more of these temperatures
have not been measured, we use equations (5) – (7)
to calculate a temperature for the ionization zone that
is not measured. Given the scatter measured in the
new temperature-temperature relations, where possible,
T[N ii] is selected over T[S iii] where estimating T[O iii];
similarly, T[O iii] is preferentially selected to estimate
T[N ii]. When an ionic temperature is calculated via
equations (5) – (7), the intrinsic dispersion for the rela-
tion used is adopted as the uncertainty in that adopted
temperature. Both measured temperatures and the
adopted temperatures are reported in Table 7 (the full
table is available online).

Note. — Hii regions that are in common between our new observations and Kennicutt et al. (2003), Bresolin (2007), and Li et al. (2013). For each
Hii region we give the oﬀset from the galaxy center given in Table 1 on the ﬁrst line along with the derived results from this study. In the subsequent
lines for each given region we report the name used in the comparison study as well as give an abbreviated name for each study, namely, K03 for
Kennicutt et al. (2003), B07 for Bresolin (2007), and L13 for Li et al. (2013). Fluxes are given in units of Hβ = 100.

† These regions are compared to the published values from Kennicutt et al. (2003), Bresolin (2007) as discussed in the text.

3.4. Ionization Correction Factors
Nebular oxygen abundances obtained from optical
spectra are quite straightforward. Given the similar
ionization potentials of neutral hydrogen and oxygen,
13.60 eV and 13.62 eV respectively, we can reasonably as-
sume that all the oxygen in an Hii region is ionized. Fur-
thermore, the high ionization potential of O++, 54.94 eV,
means that O+++ is also negligible in typical Hii regions.
Thus, we can account for all oxygen ions present by sum-
ming the number of singly and doubly ionized oxygen
ions. Unfortunately, other elements do not have a corre-
spondingly simple pairing of observable lines in all ion-

ization species and we must account for the presence of
unobserved ionization states.

While many studies have investigated ionization cor-
rection factors, most empirical studies are focused on
higher ionization nebulae where auroral lines are easier
to detect. By expanding our study towards low ioniza-
tion Hii regions, we must explore diﬀerent options in ion-
ization correction factors and the regime in which each
correction is valid. We refer the interested reader to Ap-
pendix A wherein we discuss the details of diﬀerent ion-
ization correction factors for each element of interest to
this work.

To derive nitrogen abundances we assume N/O =

10

Croxall et al.

N+/O+, given the well matched ionization potential of
these two species. Neon abundances were derived under
the assumption Ne/O = Ne++/O++ (Peimbert & Cos-
tero 1969). The ionization correction factor for sulfur
becomes more challenging in low ionization nebulae as
the parameter space has not been fully explored empiri-
cally. Thus, we adopt

S
O

=

S+ + S++

(8)

for O+/O ≥0.4 and the ionization correction of Thuan
et al. (1995) for O+/O ≤0.4. Similar to Kennicutt et al.
(2003) we ﬁnd the ratio of Ar++/S++ traces the Ar/S
ratio. However for low ionization nebulae we adopt a
linear correction to Ar++/S++,

log

report all ionization correction factors and abundance
ratios in Table 7.

We calculate the deprojected distance from the galaxy
center in units of the isophotal radius, R25, using the pa-
rameters given in Table 1. We plot the radial abundance
gradients for O/H, N/O, S/O, Ar/O, and Ne/O in Figure
6. The CHAOS observations span the disk of NGC 5457
from R/R25 ∼0.10 to R/R25 ∼1.05, and including previ-
ously published direct abundances extends that outward
to R/R25 ∼1.25. For consistency, we have, in addition
to recomputing the abundances using new atomic data
as described above, deprojected the distance to each Hii
region using the same parameters. When a given Hii
region is present in multiple samples we have elected to
adopt the new measurements from this study.

We note that the N/O abundance ratio is insensitive
to changes in temperature because the temperature sen-
sitivities of N+ and O+ are very similar. Thus, in regions
where we do not any detect auroral line, we report the
assumed temperature and derived N/O values in Table
3. These are based on a semi-empirical approach (van
Zee et al. 1997) where an electron temperature is used to
calculate the relative N/O abundance ratio. Speciﬁcally,
we use an electron temperature consistent with the av-
erage of the the R-calibration and the S-calibration from
Pilyugin & Grebel (2016).

Using the Bayesian method described by Kelly (2007,
see description in Section 3.1), we ﬁt each elemental
abundance gradient as both a function of the isophotal
radius and the radius in kpc. We have assumed an error
of 0.05 (R/R25 on the radial positions, though the eﬀect
of including this error was found to be negligible. This
approach allows us a better understanding of the internal
dispersion of each element that could be present in the
gradient and the error envelope of the slopes. The best
ﬁt to our direct abundance determinations are given as:

8.716(±0.023) − 0.832(±0.044) (R/R25)

We plot these radial trends as solid lines in Figure 6.
We also plot the distribution of possible ﬁts from our
Monte-Carlo ﬁtting as lighter gray lines. For the O/H
gradient we also plot the derived gradients of Kenni-
cutt et al. (2003) and Li et al. (2013) as green and cyan
dashed lines respectively. Both gradients reported in the
literature are in agreement within our distribution of un-
certainties. Our ﬁt suggests that the O/H is character-
ized by an internal dispersion of 0.074 ± 0.009 about the
O/H gradient and the N/O gradient is characterized by
a dispersion of 0.095 ± 0.009. While no ﬂattening of the
O/H gradient is apparent, past R/R25 = 0.64 the N/O is
better characterized by a constant value of log(N/O) =
−1.434 ± 0.107. Finally, as can be seen in Figure 6 we do
not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant gradients in S/O, Ar/O
or Ne/O.

3.6. Strong-Line Abundances
Despite their larger systematic uncertainties (e.g. Kew-
ley & Ellison 2008), strong-line abundance calibrations
are often used to determine abundances when auroral
lines are not detected. Even though these strong-line
systems lack an absolute calibration (cf., Pilyugin &
Grebel 2016) some authors have recently claimed that
these methods may be more reliable as they do not rely
on a weak line whose measurement uncertainty could be
underestimated and thus produce less scatter (Arellano-
C´ordova 2016).

While a full analysis of all strong line methods will

using identical atomic data and temperature-temperature relations. We plot the O/H and N/O abundance gradients we derive from direct
abundance determinations as solid lines, with the ﬂattened portion of the N/O gradient plotted as a dashed line. We include data from
Hii regions in which auroral lines are not detected as smaller points on the N/O gradient, as this quantity is relatively insensitive to the
electron temperature. For the S/O and Ar/O gradients we plot the mean value of the data as a dashed line. For Ne/O the dashed line

be deferred to leverage a complete CHAOS dataset to
more fully cover the excitation and abundance parame-
ter space, we have compared the direct abundance results
presented in this work with strong-line calibrations. In
particular, we compared with the recent work by Pilyu-
gin & Grebel (2016) that used published observations of
NGC 5457 as the veriﬁcation set for their strong-line cal-
ibration. Both strong-line calibrations developed by Pi-
lyugin & Grebel (2016) successfully reproduce the abun-
dance gradient within the one-sigma errors. More im-
portantly, they do not decrease the scatter seen about
the gradient. However, we note that any strong-line cal-
ibration can mask actual deviations from the abundance
gradient detected by direct abundances.

4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Internal Dispersion and Second Parameters in the

Abundance Gradient

When piecing together the history of chemical en-
richment in galaxies, simplifying assumptions are made.
Hence it is common to assume that abundances in a mas-
sive spiral galaxy vary radially with little to no scatter
azimuthally. While this assumption must clearly break-
down at some point, it has been hard to quantify the
amount of scatter at a given radius given the data that
have hitherto been available for most galaxies. We have
measured an internal dispersion of 0.074±0.009 about the
O/H gradient in NGC 5475. While this is less than the
scatter seen by Rosolowsky & Simon (2008) (0.11 dex)
and Berg et al. (2015) (0.16 dex), in M33 and NGC 0628
respectively, it is non-negligible.

Although we have gone to great lengths to propagate
uncertainties in determining abundances, apparent scat-
ter in the abundances could be due to underestimated un-
certainties. In order to produce an average error equal to
the scatter in O/H gradient, we would have to increase
the uncertainty of 12+log(O/H) in each Hii region by
0.06 dex. Similarly, to reduce the internal dispersion ﬁt
by our Monte-Carlo Markov Chain so that it is insigniﬁ-
cant we would need to locate an additional 0.1 dex. Even
though we cannot preclude the possibility of unaccounted
for uncertainties (see Section 2.2) we cannot justify an
additional 0.06 dex, much less 0.1 dex, uncertainty in ev-
ery abundance determination.

Berg et al. (2015) suggest that some of the scatter in
their derived O/H gradient could arise from temperature
abnormalities. In contrast, in this dataset we ﬁnd a good
correlation between diﬀerent ionic temperatures (see Fig-
ure 3). Accordingly, the dispersion seen at a given radius
in NGC 5457 cannot be due to simply using incorrect
temperatures. Furthermore, if scatter were introduced
as a function of the electron temperature used to de-
duce abundances, the dispersion should be suppressed in
the N/O ratio, which is signiﬁcantly less sensitive to the
temperature of the nebula. However, both the O/H and
N/O gradients show the approximately the same amount
of internal dispersion.

To better understand the dispersion about the O/H
gradient in NGC 5457 we have investigated it as a func-
tion of various additional parameters.
In Figure 7 we
show residuals from the O/H gradient as a function of
the radial extent and color-coded based on O+/O. We
also plot dashed lines at ±0.074, the extent of the in-

ternal dispersion measured in the O/H. It is clear that
low ionization regions at the center of the galaxy do ex-
hibit both larger uncertainties and an increased disper-
sion. However, Hii regions of all excitations ﬁll the ex-
tent of the measured internal dispersion. Additionally, in
Figure 7 we highlight two regions, NGC 5457-368.3-285.6
and NGC 5457-540.5-149.9, labeled A and B respectively,
which are located at a similar radius in NGC 5457 and
which exhibit similar states of ionization. However, these
two regions lie on opposite sides of the O/H gradient
with signiﬁcant residuals. To highlight the physical dif-
ferences in these regions, we also plot a portion of their
extracted spectra, focused on the auroral [O iii] λ4363.
The blue line shows the modeled spectrum, assuming
Gaussian line proﬁles, while the red line indicates the
line strengths needed to yield an abundance that would
lie on equation (10). It is clearly evident that line mea-
surements that would yield abundances consistent with
the mean O/H gradient are not consistent with the data.
In addition to investigating residuals from the O/H
gradient with respect to radial location we consider many
other logical candidates for possible second parameters.
These include physically motived parameters, such as the
ionization parameter P, and data driven considerations,
for example the equivalent width of the auroral lines.
In Table 4 we give the parameters searched and their

parameters show a signiﬁcant correlation with the O/H
residuals.

Looking at the two dimensional distribution of abun-
dances in NGC 5457 we do see a possible mild correlation
with the spiral arms, as traced out by the Hii regions.
Using the CONTOUR routine in IDL we interpolate be-
tween our irregularly spaced data to create surface maps
of oxygen abundance in NGC 5457. We show two di-
mensional maps of 12+log(O/H) in NGC 5457, based on
assuming a simple radial gradient (left) and the direct
abundances measured in regions where we detect auro-
ral lines (right), in Figure 8. Comparing these two maps
shows that deviations from the O/H gradient are rela-
tively localized. Indeed, isolating individual spiral arms

Fig. 7.— Residuals from the O/H abundance gradient plotted against their R/R25. Each Hii region is color coded using its derived ratio
of O+/O to trace ionization state. We identify two regions which are located at similar radius and have a similar ionization state but which
have very diﬀerent abundances with residuals on opposite sides of the spread. Spectral extractions, focused on the portion of the spectrum
containing [O iii] λ4363, for these two regions are shown to the right with data plotted in black and the modeled spectrum shown in blue.
The redline indicates the measurement of the [O iii] λ4363 required to fall on the O/H gradient.

in ﬁtting abundance gradients does not signiﬁcantly di-
minish the internal dispersion measured. However, care
must be taken as comparing the locations of the observed
Hii regions (Black + signs) to the structure shows that
even with 74 regions, sparse sampling clearly aﬀects the
derived map.

While we cannot justify the signiﬁcant amount of error
which must be added to our measurements to eliminate
this large amount of scatter, there are other possibilities
that remain to be explored. One likely contribution to
this scatter is the fact that we have assumed each Hii re-
gion is composed of three zones that exist as isothermal
slabs as gas-phase entities embedded in the surrounding
interstellar medium. This is clearly not a physically ac-
curate description of the system. Rather, as the higher
ionization zone is embedded within the lower ionization
there must be, at the very least, a gradual transition of
electron temperature across this boundary. Further com-
plicating this picture is the fact that images of Hii regions
clearly show they are not smooth Str¨omgren spheres but
show noticeable structure.

Eﬀects of this scenario were ﬁrst discussed by Peimbert
(1967), who established a formalism to deal with the in-
homogeneity of the temperature zones. These thermal
inhomogeneities have been estimated to necessitate cor-
rections on the order of 0.15−0.35 dex (Pe˜na-Guerrero et
al. 2012), a factor that is larger than the measured dis-
persion. While investigation of temperature ﬂuctuations
is beyond the scope of this work we note that the MODS
spectra contain numerous detections of the Balmer neb-
ular continuum jump, which is useful in determining the
normalized standard deviation from the average temper-
ature, i.e,

t2 =

(cid:28) [T (r)− < T (r) >]2
< T (r) >2

(cid:29)

.

(12)

Furthermore, the exquisite data will permit detailed
modeling by photoionization codes (e.g., Ferland et al.
2013; Dopita et al. 2013) that can go beyond a simple
three-zone model.

4.2. Enrichment relative to Oxygen
In Figure 9 we plot N/O, S/O, Ne/O, and Ar/O as
a function of O/H. As expected from stellar nucleosyn-
thetic yields (e.g., Woosley & Weaver 1995) and the as-
sumption of a universal initial mass function, these ratios
are ﬂat as a function of the radial extent of the galaxy.
The S/O, Ar/O, and Ne/O ratios are largely consistent
with the constant values observed in massive and low
mass star-forming galaxies. We note that some of the
oﬀset seen between our data (red points) and data culled
from the literature is likely due to the adoption of slightly
diﬀerent atomic data and ICFs. Furthermore we note
that by using the updated ICFs we do not detect de-
pressed values of Ar/O and S/O in the most metal rich
Hii regions (12 + log(O/H) (cid:38) 8.75) as reported in Croxall
et al. (2015). As seen in other studies, we ﬁnd increased
secondary production of nitrogen at higher O/H (e.g.,
Vila-Costas & Edmunds 1992). Similar to Croxall et al.
(2015) we detect signatures of massive Wolf-Rayet stars
in several apertures (see Table 5). However, the pres-
ence of features attributed to Wolf-Rayet stars does not
appear to lead to any trends of altered abundances.

While the bulk Ne/O trend is indeed ﬂat, there exists
a population of Hii regions with a signiﬁcant oﬀset to
low values of Ne/O, i.e., log(Ne/O)≈ −1 (see Figures
6 and 9). The existence of two populations of Ne/O,
rather than simply a large spread in a single population,
is conﬁrmed using a nonparametric kernel technique that
does not presuppose an a priori shape to the distribution
(Vio et al. 1994; Ryden 2006). Hii regions that exhibit
low Ne/O do not display unusual deﬁcits in other relative

abundances, e.g., O/H, N/O, S/O, or Ar/O, and span
the full range of O/H we have measured. These regions
are not isolated in a speciﬁc location in NGC 5457, nor
are they correlated with the presence of unusual features,
such as Wolf-Rayet features or narrow He ii emission, in
the spectra.

We note that in our derivation of Ne abundances we
have used only the isolated [Ne iii] λ3868 line; thus, the
low abundances cannot be attribution to errors in de-
blending the [Ne iii] λ3967 line with the nearby H7 line.
Furthermore, Figure 9 shows that similar values of Ne/O
are not uncommon in the literature. However, the re-
duction in measurement uncertainty permitted by the
CHAOS data reveal these regions to be a second popu-
lation and not simply statistical outliers.

5. CONCLUSIONS
Leveraging the the power of the LBT with the broad
spectral range and sensitivity of MODS, we measure have
measured uniform “direct” abundances in a large sample
of Hii regions in spiral galaxies as part of the CHAOS
project. Here we highlight our observations of 101 Hii
regions in NGC 5457 (M 101), with a speciﬁc focus on
the 74 regions where we detected at least one of the tem-
perature sensitive auroral lines of either [O iii], λ4363,
[N ii], λ5755, or [S iii], λ6312.
In 55 cases, more than
one of these innately faint emission lines were detected,
permitting a comparison of multiple temperature mea-
surements.

The detection of multiple auroral lines in numerous
Hii regions allows us to explore the correlations between
the diﬀerent derived ionic temperature zones. We have
found (1) strong correlations of T[N ii] with T[S iii] and
T[O iii], consistent with little or no intrinsic dispersion
and the predictions of photoionization modeling; (2) a
correlation of T[S iii] with T[O iii], but with signiﬁcant
dispersion and signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the prediction
of photoionization modeling; (3) overall agreement be-
tween T[N ii], T[S ii], and T[O ii], as expected, but with
signiﬁcant dispersion.

Given these numerous detections of lines, particularly
in the less explored low ionization regime, i.e., O+/O>
0.4, we inspect the commonly used ICFs. Unfortunately,
many of the common ICFs are found to be deﬁcient in

this region of parameter space. We propose new empir-
ical ICFs for S and Ar based on our large uniform data
set.

One additional reason we targeted NGC 5457 was to
permit a robust comparison with the data of Kenni-
cutt et al. (2003), Bresolin (2007), and Li et al. (2013).
We show that our pipelines produce results that are in
very good agreement with the older data, when updated
atomic data are taken into consideration. Furthermore,
our MODS spectra show that some of the unusual tem-
peratures measured in Kennicutt et al. (2003) can be
rectiﬁed with the higher signal-to-noise of our data. On
the other hand, we also detect clear evidence that some
unusual temperatures are not due to the diﬃculty of mea-
suring innately weak lines.

We measure abundance gradients in both O/H and
N/O that are in good agreement with the previous
measurements in the literature, namely a steep gradi-
ent that drops from approximately solar-neighborhood
metallicity in the center of NGC 5457 (Nieva & Przy-
billa 2012). At R/R25 ≈0.7 we detect a clear ﬂatten-
ing of the N/O gradient signaling the low metallicity
outer regions of NGC 5457 are dominated by primary
production of N. We ﬁt these abundance gradients using
a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo approach that includes the
possibility that intrinsic dispersion is present. Despite
diﬀerent dependencies on temperature, both O/H and
N/O gradients show the presence of signiﬁcant internal
dispersion at a given radius, namely, 0.074 ± 0.009 dex
and 0.095±0.009 dex respectively. Furthermore, we have
shown that this dispersion is not related to ionization or
other likely second parameters measured from the spec-
tra or their location in the galaxy but appears to be
somewhat stochastic.

In contrast, Ne/O, Ar/O, and S/O all exhibit ﬂat
trends with O/H consistent with no evolution of these
abundance ratios across the entire disk of NGC 54557.
While the median value of Ne/O is indeed constant with
O/H, we discover a population of Hii regions with a sig-
niﬁcant oﬀset to low values in Ne/O, ∼ −1. This popula-
tion is present across the range of ionization parameters
and abundance trends measured. Comparing Ne/O mea-
surements from CHAOS with those from the literature

advent of very sensitive multi-object spectrographs have
we been able to measure the requisite features necessary
to truly map out the patterns of the evolution. These
observations are vital in understanding the origin of the
elements and their role in the shaping galaxies and the
universe as we see it.

APPENDIX

IONIZATION CORRECTION FACTORS

Nitrogen
Nitrogen abundances were derived under the assumption that

N/O = N +/O+.

(A1)

This assumption has been well tested in low abundance nebulae (Garnett 1990). Unfortunately, it’s validity is less
certain in higher abundance spiral galaxies. We note that combining observations of the ultraviolet N iii] and the
far-IR [N iii] 57µm line with the now large sample of metal rich Hii regions with optically measured N+/O+ would be
greatly beneﬁcial in establishing the veracity of this assumption in cool metal-rich environments.

We note that the work of Nava et al. (2006) suggest that the nitrogen ICF should have a scale factor of 1.08±0.09
rather than that of unity. While we have not at this time adopted this scale factor, we note that its adoption does not
alter any conclusions and merely results in a simple increase of all reported log(N/O) values by 0.03 dex.

Fig. 10.— The ratio of Ne++/O++ as a function of the ionization fraction of oxygen, O+/O for Hii regions in NGC 5457. We also include

the ionization corrections fractions derived by Dors et al. (2013).

Neon
Similar to nitrogen, neon can only be measured in one ionization state in optical nebulae. Peimbert & Costero

(1969) suggested that neon abundance could be derived under the assumption

N e/O = N e++/O++.

(A2)

As neon is signiﬁcantly stronger in high-ionization nebula, it has predominantly been measured in low abundance
nebula.
In pushing towards neon measurements in low-ionization nebula, Kennicutt et al. (2003) noted that the
scatter in Ne++/O++ increased at higher O+/O. This could indicate that the neon ionization correction factor does
signiﬁcantly change as Hii regions become cooler. Dors et al. (2013) revisited the ionization fraction of neon by using
mid-IR observations of [Ne ii] and [Ne iii] to directly measure the neon ionization fraction. However, they note that
the overlap between visible and IR measurements of neon is limited to more metal poor regions.

Given the sensitivity of the MODS1 spectrograph, we are able to detect the [Ne iii] λ3869 line in 40 Hii regions with
a 12+log(O/H) ≥ 8.4. In Figure 10 we show the ratio of Ne++/O++ as a function of the ionization fraction of oxygen,
O+/O. In addition to the Peimbert & Costero (1969) relation we also plot the two ionization correction factors derived
by Dors et al. (2013),

and

where

ICF (N e++)model = 0.741 − 0.08x + 0.393/x,

ICF (N e++)IR = 2.382 − 1.301x + 0.05/x(for x > 0.4),

x ≡ O++/(O+ + O++),

(A3)

(A4)

(A5)

normalized to a constant log(Ne/O) = -0.70.

The majority of our data are indeed consistent with a constant ratio across a wide range of ionization. Compared
to equation (A2), both ICFs derived by Dors et al. (2013) appear to under-predict the amount of Ne relative to
oxygen. Indeed, adopting the ionization correction of Peimbert & Costero (1969) for neon yields agreement with the
IR measurements of Dors et al. (2013), a constant Ne/O ratio at log(Ne/O) = -0.70.

However, we see a related phenomena to the increased scatter at higher O+/O reported by Kennicutt et al. (2003)
in our signiﬁcantly larger dataset, 42 regions in this portion of parameter space compared to two regions. Ne++/O++
appears to bifurcate and inhabit either a high or a low ratio, both of which are ﬂat as a function of O+/O. It is worth
noting that the cluster at Ne++/O++ ∼ 1.0 appears to agree more closely with the results from IR data (Dors et al.
2013). Given the quality of the spectra, we rule out measurement error as a cause for the low values of Ne++/O++.
Furthermore, we note that only the [Ne iii] λ3869 line has been used, thus this can not be attributed to blended lines
that have skewed the measurement of the [Ne iii] λ3967 line, which does give consistent results.

For this work we choose to use the ionization correction formula from Peimbert & Costero (1969), i.e., equation (A2).
However, we note that this result is more robust in metal poor Hii regions that are characterized by high ionization
parameters. Indeed, the mid-IR lines in metal rich regions warrant more investigation once the JWST is active.

Sulfur
While both S+ and S++ are observed in our spectra, we must account for the presence of S+3 (30.2 eV) in the highly
ionized region (Garnett 1989). An analytical ionization correction factor for sulfur has been reported by Thuan et al.

on earlier photoionization models (Stasi´nska 1978):

with α = 2.5. We show these two relations as dashed blue (Kennicutt et al. 2003) and dotted red (Thuan et al. 1995)
lines, along with our data in Figure 11 for an assumed (constant) intrinsic log(S/O) = −1.60. While our data do
not explore the parameter space of highly ionized regions (i.e., O+/O ≤0.2), compared to previous works, they more
thoroughly populate the low ionization region revealing a clear trend with the oxygen ionization fraction that is not
seen in the models. We also note that atomic data for sulfur has been signiﬁcantly revised in recent years. This change
in atomic data alone can account for a shift of ≈0.1 dex between the reported values of (S+ + S++)/(O+ + O++) and
those derived by models using older atomic data.

Comparing the ionization potentials of the observed sulfur ions, S+ (10.4 eV) and S++ (23.3 eV), with the observed
oxygen ions, O+ (13.6 eV) and O++ (35.1 eV), suggests that singly ionized oxygen may be a better tracer of the sulfur
in cooler Hii regions. This is clearly illustrated in the bottom panel of Figure 11 where the ratio (S+ + S++)/O+
is constant for O+/O ≥0.4. This ratio was previously adopted as an ICF for sulfur (Peimbert & Costero 1969).
However, Pagel (1978) noted a correlation with O+/O in the observed Hii regions at the time. While we do detect
this correlation, the larger dataset, which is in agreement with the data of Pagel (1978), shows that the correlation is
limited to high ionization Hii regions.

Adopting the Thuan et al. (1995) or Kennicutt et al. (2003) ICFs for sulfur results in a signiﬁcant trend in S/O with

O+/O whereas (S+ + S++)/O+ indicates this ratio should be ﬂat (Garnett 1989). Therefore, we adopt

S

(A8)

for O+/O ≥0.4 and the ionization correction of Thuan et al. (1995) for O+/O ≤0.4

Argon
Similar to neon, only one ionization state is observed. However, like sulfur, in most nebular conditions, thee ionization
states can be present: Ar+ in low ionization zones and Ar+3 in the highly ionized portions of the nebulae. Given that
the ionization potentials of sulfur and oxygen ions bracket the respective energy levels in argon ions, ratios with both
elements have been used to trace the unseen argon.

In Figure 12 (top panel) we show the ratio of Ar++/O++ as a function of O+/O along with the ICF of Thuan et al.

where x is again deﬁned in (11), for an assumed (constant) intrinsic log(Ar/O) = −2.20. In agreement with Kennicutt
et al. (2003), we ﬁnd that this ratio is strongly correlated with the ionic fraction of oxygen and is thus a poor predictor

of Ar/O. We also show the ratio of Ar++/S++ as a function of O+/O in Figure 12 (bottom panel). Kennicutt et
al. (2003) found this ratio to be uncorrelated with O+/O and, aside from a single low ionization region, to exhibit
a constant value, log(Ar++/S++)= -0.60. Our sample clearly shows that low ionization regions do not maintain a
constant value of Ar++/S++ rendering it insuﬃcient as a sole representative of Ar/S.

To correct for the decrease in Ar++/S++ in low ionization nebula, we adopt a linear correction to Ar++/S++,

to account for an increase in the Ar+ population before adopting this ratio as representative of the Ar/S ratio, with
an uncertainty of ≈ ±0.1 dex. To fully explore the validity of this assumption, observations of the 70 µm [Ar ii] line
are needed. Currently, this line is only accessible with the SOFIA observatory.

Note. — Observing logs for Hii regions observed in NGC 5457 using MODS on the LBT during the 2015A semester. Each exposure was taken
with an integrated exposure time of 1200s on clear nights, with, on average ∼1.(cid:48)(cid:48)00 seeing, and airmasses less than 1.3. Slit ID, composed of the
oﬀset in R.A. and Dec., in arcseconds, from the central position listed in Table 1 is listed in Column 1. The right ascension and declination of
the individual Hii regions are given in units of hours, minutes, and seconds, and degrees, arcminutes, and arcseconds respectively in columns 2
and 3. We list the position angle of the slit and the size of the region extracted along each slit in columns 4 and 5. The de-projected distances of
Hii regions from the center of the galaxy as a fraction of R25 is listed in column 6. Columns 7-11 highlight which regions have [O iii] λ4363, [N ii]
λ5755, [S iii] λ6312, [O ii] 7330, [S ii] λ4070 auroral lines detections at the 3σ signiﬁcance level. We note in columns 12 and 13 which Hii regions
have detections of broad Wolf-Rayet features and narrow He ii λ4686 emission. Finally Column 14 reports alternate names for the observed Hii
regions primarily taken from Hodge et al. (1990)
