Abstract A broadband two-layer anti-reﬂection (AR) coating was developed for
use on a sapphire half-wave plate (HWP) and an alumina infrared (IR) ﬁlter for
cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarimetry. Measuring tiny CMB B-mode
signals requires maximizing the number of photons reaching the detectors and
minimizing spurious polarization due to reﬂection with an oﬀ-axis incident angle.
However, a sapphire HWP and an alumina IR ﬁlter have high refractive indices
of (cid:39) 3.1, and an AR coating must be applied to them. Thermally sprayed mullite
and Duroid 5880LZ were selected in terms of index and coeﬃcient of thermal
expansion for use at cryogenic temperatures. With these materials, the reﬂectivity
was reduced to about 2% at 90/150 GHz and <1% at 220/280 GHz. The design,
fabrication, and optical performance evaluation of the AR coatings are described.
The coatings were used in a current ground-based CMB experiment called the
Simons Array. They could also be applied to next-generation CMB experiments,
such as the Simons Observatory.

1 Introduction

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) has a variety of information that is use-
ful for understanding the early universe [1, 2]. In particular, B-mode polarization
is a unique pattern of parity-odd polarization that derives from primordial gravi-
tational waves and gravitational lensing. The observation of B-mode polarization
from primordial gravitational waves would provide strong evidence of inﬂation.

For high-precision CMB experiments, recent advances in the development of
devices to reduce systematic errors originating from optical systems and to im-
prove sensitivity have occurred. Optical elements, such as continuously rotating
half-wave plates (HWPs) and ﬁlters, have been introduced. A HWP modulates

the polarization signal, and the ﬁlter removes infrared (IR) signals. However, the
sapphire and alumina used for HWPs and IR ﬁlters have high refractive indices of
(cid:39) 3.1 [3, 4]. Thus, they refract much light and increase systematic and statistical
uncertainties.

To solve this problem, an anti-reﬂection (AR) coating is critical for these ma-
terials. Some ways to apply AR coatings like layering dielectrics or machining
sub-wavelength structures have been reported [5, 6]. In these methods, layering
dielectrics were chosen in terms of the hardness of machining substrates, which
are sapphire or alumina, machining speed of large-diameter substrates, and ap-
plication possibility to the high-frequency band. Our AR coating consists of two
dielectric layers and can reduce reﬂectivity using the materials with diﬀerent re-
fractive indices on the surface of optical elements. By adjusting the thickness of
the coating materials, an AR coating can be optimized for a speciﬁc frequency
band.

In this paper, the development of broadband multi-layer AR coatings for CMB
experiments with 90/150 GHz and 220/280 GHz dichroic detectors that each cover
approximately 30% of the fractional bandwidth is presented. To realize this broad-
band frequency coverage, two-layer coatings with an average reﬂectivity of less than
3% were developed. Two challenges regarding AR coatings for CMB observations
should be mentioned. First, it is diﬃcult to apply a coating on 50-cm-diameter
sapphire or alumina with uniformity of tens of microns. Second, the AR-coated
optical elements are cooled down to 40 or 4 K to reduce thermal radiation on the
cryogenic detectors, which creates challenges associated with diﬀerential thermal
contraction.

For the ﬁrst layer, thermally sprayed mullite [3], a ceramic material (Tocalo
Corporation) [7], was used, while the second layer was Duroid 5880LZ, a com-
posite material (Rogers Corporation) [8]. These materials were selected both for
their refractive index and coeﬃcient of thermal expansion. AR coating’s design,
fabrication, and its optical performance at room temperature are discussed.

2 Design and fabrication

The targets of our AR coating are ground-based CMB experiments, and the re-
quirements of the HWP and IR ﬁlter are described bellow:

– The diameters of the HWP and the ﬁlter are about 50 cm, and the AR coating

needs to be applied evenly to this large diameter [9, 10].

– The reﬂectance should be reduced to a few percent at the detector bands.
Roughly, 80-110/130-170 GHz and 200-260/260-320 GHz were chosen to cal-
culate the average reﬂectance for each one [11, 12, 13].

– The AR coatings should not delaminate when cooled because the ﬁlter and the

HWP are used at 40-50 K, and ∼4 K in some cases [10].

Multiple reports have been made so far [14, 15, 16], but producing repeatable at
large diameters is still challenging. To achieve such broadband and low-reﬂectivity
coatings, two-layer coatings were developed in our study. In our coating, the re-
ﬂectance was minimized at a speciﬁc frequency band by layering dielectrics with
diﬀerent refractive indices, which step down to a refractive index of 1 for air.
First, the optimal indices of the layers were calculated. Using the condition that
the optical thickness of each layer was λ/4 wavelengths relative to the incident

for which n1, n2, and ns are the indices of the ﬁrst layer, second layer, and sapphire
or alumina, respectively. This order originates from the transmitted and reﬂected
waves being 180 degrees out of phase, and the interference causes a reduction in
the reﬂectance [17]. Considering the index, coeﬃcient of thermal expansion, and
compressive modulus, coating materials were chosen to satisfy the study require-
ments. Figure 1 shows a diagram of our AR coatings. Mullite ceramic [7] was
selected as the ﬁrst layer and Duroid 5880LZ [8] aluminosilicate microspheres as
the second layer. Mullite had been used before [3], but the combination of mullite
and Duroid was used for the ﬁrst time. The properties of the coating layers are
listed in Table 1.

After selecting the coating materials, small test samples were fabricated after
calculating the thicknesses of layers by minimizing the average reﬂectance between
the frequency bands. The predicted reﬂectance was calculated as an inﬁnite plane
wave incident on a homogeneous dielectric thin layer.

The middle part of Figure 1 shows a photo of the fabricated AR coating sam-
ple. A 10-cm square of alumina with a thickness of 4 mm was used. The ﬁrst
layer of mullite was thermally sprayed on both alumina surfaces [3] by the Tocalo
Corporation. This process uses an established and available technology and can
be fabricated to a high precision of 10 µm. Because mullite has a coeﬃcient of
thermal expansion matched to that of alumina and adheres better to alumina, it
would not cause delamination under cryogenic conditions [3]. The second layer of
Duroid was glued on with 40-µm-thick Epo-Tek, a type of epoxy. Duroid thickness
was machined to 385±10 µm at Suzuno Giken [18]. To compute the accurate model
during simulation, the reﬂectance was eﬀectively calculated with three layers in-
cluding the thin layer of Epo-Tek. Thickness of the Epo-Tek layer is 20-40µm.
While this may appear rather large uncertainty, there is relatively an impact on
the transmission due to this thickness because the Epo-Tek layer is thin and its

index is almost exactly the mean of the indices of mullite and Duroid. The optical
performance at 300 K was checked, and the thickness was reoptimized while con-
sidering the thickness trend resulting from the optical measurement. This process
was repeated until the best coating was ﬁnally obtained.

A large-diameter sample was fabricated in the same way as the small sample
after determining the optimal thickness with a small test sample, thus completing
the development of coatings for 90/150 GHz. A HWP sandwiched between AR-
coated alumina (Figure 1) and an IR ﬁlter with our coatings were used in an
experiment with the telescope of the Simons Array.

3 Optical performance and cryogenic validation

The optical performance of the small samples was analyzed using a vector network
analyzer (VNA) at Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe
(IPMU). The reﬂectivity at an incident angle of 45 degrees and transmissivity of
55 to 330 GHz was measured, which is the required frequency range for CMB
observation. The measurement setup at room temperature is shown in Figure 2.
We measured an alumina slab without AR before measuring AR coating samples
as a validation of the setup and conﬁrmed that the same fringe patterns were
measured as predicted.

Figure 3 shows the measured reﬂectivity (an example from the 220/280 GHz
sample). First, measured reﬂection at 45-degree incidence was ﬁtted with thickness
and index of each layer. Optical measurements were performed once after spraying
mullite but before applying Duroid coating, so the resulting thickness and index
were reliable. The ﬁt values were then substituted in the model with a zero-degree
incident angle. Finally, the average reﬂectance was calculated at zero degrees at
the detector bands. Some samples were also measured at a diﬀerent incidence angle
(18 degrees) to conﬁrm that this analytical process was accurate.

Table 2 shows the average reﬂectance results of the small samples. It was
possible to make samples with an average reﬂectance of <3% for 90/150 GHz
and 1% for 220/280 GHz. The diﬀerence between the sample and design mainly
originates from the thickness of each layer and the production tolerance. This error
is roughly in the 2σ range. However, the overall performance is important, and

both the 90/150 GHz and 220/280 GHz samples were well constructed. For the
90/150 GHz sample, another AR coating using other dielectrics was available, and
the performance of our coating was comparable to that of it.

The transmission to estimate the AR coating’s loss tangent, tanδ, was also
measured. By measuring the decrease in transmittance and combining it with the
reﬂectance measurement, tanδ could be determined. The loss tangents of materials
increase as the frequency increases, and it is necessary to estimate them, especially
for the 220/280 GHz sample. At lower temperatures, the loss tangent is expected
to decrease. Therefore, an upper limit on the loss tangent could be added by
measuring the transmittance at room temperature.

Figure 4 shows the measured data of the 220/280 GHz sample. For prediction,
the index and thickness ﬁt values obtained from the reﬂectance measurement were
substituted. First, it was conﬁrmed that the fringe patterns of reﬂectance and
transmittance were consistent, and the results showed that the measurement sys-
tem was valid. Then, the materials’ loss tangent was ﬁtted while ﬁxing the indices
and thickness to the values obtained from the reﬂectance measurement. After ﬁt-
ting the measured transmission, the transmission was estimated at about 80 K,
the temperature at which the HWPs and alumina ﬁlters operate. The AR coat-
ing’s loss tangent decreased at low temperature, and transmission was expected
to increase by ∼20% at 80 K. To estimate how much the average transmittance
increases at the cryogenic temperature, the values of the alumina index were ﬁxed
according to Inoue et al. [3] and the other indices and thicknesses to the measured
values at room temperature, and how much the average transmittance increased
(how much absorption decreased) was estimated. Table 3 shows the ﬁt values and
prediction of the materials’ loss tangents at 80 K. Since these estimates rely on
some of the values extrapolated from other frequencies or temperature, actual mea-

surements must be taken to conﬁrm them. The performance at low temperature
will be evaluated in future work.

As a cryo-mechanical test, a cooldown test was also conducted to make sure
that the fabricated samples did not delaminate when cooled. Duroid was diced into
4 × 4 cm square islands after the Epo-Tek has cured while the mullite layer was
not diced to prevent peeling due to heat shrinkage. The large diameter sample was
cooled three times to 30 K at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization.
No delamination after cooldown occurred, and the optical performance was the
same as before cooling. This cooldown test was performed every time a large
sample was fabricated. After the cooldown test, an optical test was performed
to conﬁrm that the optical performance was unchanged compared to the earlier
stage, indicating that no delamination had occurred. For optical measurements,
a total of nine locations were measured (center and eight peripheral locations) to
ensure that the coating was uniform. The detail of the veriﬁcation process will be
described in our future manuscript.

4 Conclusion

The designs, fabrication, and optical performance of a 2-layer AR coating for CMB
polarimetry at 90/150 GHz and 220/280 GHz are presented. Our coatings with
mullite and Duroid 5880LZ led to a reduction in the reﬂectivity to about 2.7%
at 90/150 GHz and < 1% at 220/280 GHz. A HWP and an IR ﬁlter with our
90/150 GHz coating was used in the Simons Array experiment. This technique
could also be applied to other CMB experiments, such as the Simons Observatory.
