Simulation of angular resolved RABBITT measurements in noble gas atoms

(Dated: April 30, 2018)

We simulate angular resolved RABBITT (Reconstruction of Attosecond Beating By Interference
of Two-photon Transitions) measurements on valence shells of noble gas atoms (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe).
Our non-perturbative numerical simulation is based on solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation for a target atom driven by an ionizing XUV and dressing IR ﬁelds. From these simulations
we extract the angular dependent magnitude and phase of the RABBITT oscillations and deduce the
corresponding angular anisotropy β parameter and Wigner time delay τW for the single XUV photon
absorption which initiates the RABBITT process. Said β and τW parameters are compared with
calculations in the random phase approximation with exchange (RPAE) which includes inter-shell
correlation. This comparison is used to test various eﬀective potentials employed in the one-electron
TDSE. In lighter atoms (Ne and Ar), several eﬀective potentials are found to provide accurate
simulation of RABBITT measurements for a wide range of photon energies up to 100 eV above
the valence shell threshold. In heavier atoms (Kr and Xe), the onset of strong correlation with the
d-shell restricts the validity of the single active electron approximation to several tens of eV above
the valence shell threshold.

INTRODUCTION

Angular resolved RABBITT (Reconstruction of At-
tosecond Beating By Interference of Two-photon Tran-
sitions) experiments have been used to coherently con-
trol the photoelectron emission direction [1] and, more
recently, to measure angular dependent time delay in
atomic photoionization [2, 3]. These experiments bring
sensitive information on ultrafast electron dynamics in-
ﬂuenced by correlation and exchange eﬀects. Theoretical
modeling of the angular resolved RABBITT process have
been provided within the framework of lowest order per-
turbation theory (LOPT) [4, 5] and non-perturbatively,
by solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
(TDSE) [2, 6]. As in our preceding paper [6], we solved
TDSE for a noble gas atom (He and Ne) driven by an
ionizing XUV and dressing IR ﬁelds in the conﬁguration
of a typical RABBITT measurement. From this solu-
tion we deduced the angular dependence of the photoe-
mission time delay as measured by the RABBITT tech-
nique [7, 8]. Our model was calibrated against a recent
angular resolved measurement on He [2]. We employed
the soft photon approximation (SPA) and used a hydro-
genic continuum-continuum (CC) correction to connect
the magnitude and phase of the RABBITT oscillations
with the angular anisotropy β parameter and the Wigner
time delay τW for the single XUV photon absorption
which initiates the RABBITT process.

Solution of the TDSE in [6] was obtained in the sin-
gle active electron (SAE) approximation and utilized the
optimized eﬀective potentials (OEP) of Sarsa et al. [9].
While such approach was found to be valid for He, this
remains to be shown for Ne and heavier noble gas atoms.
In the present work, we conduct these tests for noble
gases from Ne to Xe by making comparison of the β
and τW parameters with those coming from calculations

performed in the random phase approximation with ex-
change (RPAE), the latter including inter-shell correla-
tion and exchange of the photoelectron with the remain-
ing ionic core. These eﬀects are not included in the
TDSE/SAE model. However, the latter model takes an
accurate account of ultrafast electron dynamics whereas
the RPAE is unable to do so by its basis based construc-
tion. In lighter atoms (Ne and Ar), several eﬀective po-
tentials are found to provide accurate simulation of RAB-
BITT measurements over a wide range of photon energies
up to 100 eV above the valence shell threshold. In heav-
ier atoms (Kr and Xe), the onset of strong correlation
with the sub-valent d-shell restricts validity of the SAE
approximation to several tens of eV above the valence
shell threshold.

A further goal of the present work is to test universality
of the hydrogenic CC correction (τcc). This correction
relates the single-photon Wigner time delay (τW ) and
the measured atomic time delay (τa) via

τa = τW + τcc .

(1)

A hydrogenic CC correction was used in the theoretical
analysis of the photoemission time delay measured close
to the 3s ionization cross-section minimum in Ar [10].
The theoretical and experimental time delays reported
in [10] diﬀered by as much as 50 as and no plausible
explanation to this disagreement was found to date. We
address this issue in the present work. More recently, the
RABBITT measurement on Ne of Isinger et al. [11] has ﬁ-
nally reconciled the persistent disagreement between the
earlier experiment [12] and a large number of theoretical
predictions [13–18]. Our present calculations are simi-
larly in perfect agreement with [11].

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II we describe our method and numerical tech-
niques.
In Section III we present and analyse our nu-
merical data. We conclude by highlighting links with

 
 
 
 
 
 
existing experimental measurements and propose several
new areas of interest.

II. THEORY

A. Solution of TDSE

As previously [6], we solve the one-electron TDSE for

a target atom

sion amplitudes

The Hamiltonian ˆHint(t) describes interaction with the

This external ﬁeld is comprised of both XUV and IR

Here A0 is the vector potential peak value and T = 2π/ω
is the period of the IR ﬁeld. The XUV central frequency
is ωx and the time constants τx, τT are chosen to span
a suﬃcient number of harmonics in the range of photon
frequencies of interest for a given atom.

The vector potential of the IR pulse is modelled by the

cosine squared envelope

A(t) = A0 cos2

(cid:18)

cos[ω(t − τ )] .

(6)

The IR pulse is shifted relative to the APT by a variable
delay τ such that the RABBITT signal of the even 2q
sideband (SB) oscillates as

S2q(τ ) = A + B cos[2ωτ − C] .

(7)

Solution of the TDSE (2) is found using the iSURF
method as given in Morales et al. [19]. A typical cal-
culation with XUV and IR ﬁeld intensities of 5 × 109 and

A, B ∝ |J1(α0 · k)|2|hf |z|ii|2

(9)

∝ [1 + βP2(cos θk)] cos2 θk .

Here we made a linear approximation to the Bessel func-
tion as the parameter α0 = F0/ω2 is small in a weak IR
ﬁeld. See Appendix for a more detailed derivation. In
Eq. (9) θk is the angle between the photoelectron emis-
sion direction ˆk and the electric ﬁeld vector of the lin-
early polarised light. By ﬁtting the calculated angular
dependence of the A and B parameters with the SFA ex-
pression Eq. (9) we can obtain the two sets of the angular
anisotropy parameters βSB
B and compare them
with the value calculated by the RPAE model. At the
same time, we derive the angular dependence from the
odd high harmonic (HH) peaks by ﬁtting angular varia-
tion of their amplitude with 1 + βHHP2(cos θk). Thus, for
each target atom three sets of β parameters are extracted
and analyzed over a wide photon energy range.

A and βSB

Laurent et al. [1] proposed a diﬀerent parameterization
of the angular dependence of the RABBITT signal. In
case the APT has only the odd HH peaks, it reads

2Lmax

Fq(θk, τ ) =

βj(q, τ )Pj (cos θk)

(10)

j=0
X

∝ 1 + β2P2(cos θk) + β4P4(cos θk)

While β2 in Eq. (10) is identical with our deﬁnition of
βHH, β2 and β4 can be expressed via βSB. By expanding
Eq. (9) over the Legendre polynomials, we arrive to the
following expressions:

β2 =

70 + 55βSB
35 + 14βSB

,

β4 =

36βSB
35 + 14βSB .

(11)

A ≃ βSB

In the following, we will show that in all presently stud-
ied cases, βHH ≃ βSB
B and one set of β parameters
ﬁts all the RABBITT measurement. The β4 and β2 pa-
rameters depend on this β linearly. Thus β4 parameter
is redundant and its introduction by Cirelli et al. [3] is
superﬂuous.

The C parameter is converted to the atomic time delay
τa by (8) and analyzed as a function of the photoelectron
direction relative to the polarization axis. The angular

dependence of τa is compared with the analogous depen-
dence of the Wigner time delay τW [21]. The time delay
diﬀerence τa − τW in the zero angle direction is compared
with the hydrogenic CC correction τCC [22].

B. One-electron potential

In our previous work on He and Ne, we employed an
optimized eﬀective potential (OEP) [9]. This potential is
derived by a simpliﬁed treatment of the exchange term
in the Hartree-Fock (HF) equations using the Slater X-α
ansatz [23]. The OEP potential takes the form

where the eﬀective charge Z ∗(r) varies from the un-
screened nucleus charge Z0 as r → 0 and unity at large
distances r → ∞. The former limit is satisﬁed by impos-
n0
ing the condition
k=1 ck,0 = 1. The eﬀective charges
Z ∗(r) for Ne and Ar are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2,
respectively.

It is instructive to compare Z ∗ with the eﬀective
charge derived from the spherically symmetric part of
the Hartree potential Z ∗

Here r> = max(r, r′) and the upper limit in the sum
N − 1 indicates that the number of electrons in the singly
ionized atomic core is reduced by one. The charge Z ∗
H is
derived from the charge density of the occupied atomic
orbitals and it neglects the exchange of the departing
photoelectron with those in the core. Thus Z ∗
H provides
a convenient baseline for elucidating the exchange eﬀects.
The charge diﬀerence Z ∗ − Z ∗
H is expected to be negative
as the exchange softens the atomic core and reduces its
screening capacity. In density functional theory (DFT),
this eﬀect is termed the exchange and correlation hole
[26].

A further model potential that we employ is that of a
localized Hartree-Fock (LHF) potential generated from a
known continuous orbital calculated in a frozen HF core
[27]. The radial Schr¨odinger equation with the atomic
Hamiltonian (3) can be rewritten such that the LHF is

The LHF should be weakly sensitive to the choice of the
momentum κ and the orbital momentum ℓ. For practical
reasons, we chose κ = 0.01 and ℓ = 0 to avoid multiple
nodes of Pκℓ(r) where the RHS of Eq. (14) diverges. The
eﬀective charge Z ∗ = −rVHF(r) derived from Eq. (14)
is a smooth function outside of these nodes and can be

the Cooper minimum (CM) known from experiment. The
eﬀective charges generated with the potentials (16) and
(17) for Ar are shown in Fig. 2 along with those extracted
from the OEP and LHF potentials. As compared with
Ne, the role of exchange is signiﬁcantly larger in Ar with
the corresponding exchange hole being much greater. We
also note that charge diﬀerence Z ∗−Z ∗
H in argon with the
LHF, and particularly MD, potentials is slightly positive
at larger distances.

The valence shell energies calculated with various
model potentials along with the experimental threshold
energies are compiled in Table I. For the LHF poten-
tial, we also show in parentheses the α parameters from
Eq. (15).

III. RESULTS

A. Neon 2p shell

In Fig. 3 we display the angular anisotropy β parame-
ters for the Ne 2p valence shell extracted from the TDSE
calculations with the LHF potential (top) and the OEP
potential (bottom). The βHH parameters extracted from
the angular dependence of the high harmonic peaks are
plotted along with the βSB parameters extracted from
the angular variation of the RABBITT A and B param-
eters in Eq. (8). The RPAE calculation is shown with the
solid line. This calculation is known to reproduce accu-
rately the experimental β parameters across the studied
photon energy range [29].

We see that the harmonics and sidebands TDSE calcu-
lations of β parameters are consistent between each other
and are fairly close to the XUV-only RPAE calculation,
with the LHF results marginally closer to the RPAE than
the OEP ones.
In our previous work [6] we employed
the OEP potential and quoted βSB ≃ 0.3 for sideband 20
(SB20) which is in reasonable agreement with the present
results of both potentials.

Angular dependence of the atomic time delay τa(θk) as
a function of the escape angle is shown in Fig. 4. The top

the LHF and OEP potentials, respectively. The bottom
panel shows the angular dependence of the Wigner time
delay τW(θk) from the XUV-only RPAE calculation. We
see that both TDSE calculations are quite close to one
another while the RPAE calculation suggests an angu-
lar dependence which is an order of magnitude weaker.
The consequence being that nearly all the angular depen-
dence of the atomic time delay in Ne comes from the CC
correction introduced by the probe IR ﬁeld. A similar ob-
servation was made in He where the Wigner time delay is
isotropic [2]. In Ne, the Wigner time delay is not entirely
isotropic because the 2p → ǫs and 2p → ǫd channels
enter the ionization amplitude with their own spherical
harmonics, namely Y00(θk) and Y20(θk). However, as a
result of the Fano propensity rule [30], the d-continuum is
strongly dominant and the s-continuum contributes only
a very weak angular modulation. We note that this sit-
uation would change drastically near the CM in Ar and
heavier noble gases where the angular dependence of the
Wigner time delay is very strong.

The time delay in the polarization axis direction θk = 0
is shown in Fig. 5. On the top panel, we compare the
atomic time delay from the TDSE calculation with the

which is shown separately, is then added to the Wigner
time delay. This correction, as a function of the photo-
electron energy, is represented by the analytic expression

τCC(E) = N E−3/2[a log(E) + b]

(18)

where the coeﬃcients N , a and b are found from ﬁt-
ting the regularized continuum-continuum delay shown
in Fig. 7 of [22]. We see that except for the near thresh-
old region where the photoelectron energy is very small
and where the regularization of τCC may not be applica-
ble, the identity (1) τa ≃ τW + τcc holds very well.

This utility of the hydrogenic CC correction can be
used to analyze the recent set of RABBITT measure-
ments on Ne [11] where the time delay diﬀerence between
the 2s and 2p shells in Ne was determined. This anal-
ysis is shown in Fig. 6. On the top panel, we plot the

FIG. 5: (Color online) Time delay in the polarization axis
direction θk = 0. Top: the atomic time delay τa from the
TDSE calculation (red ﬁlled circles) is compared with the
Wigner time delay (orange triangle) from the RPAE calcula-
tion. The CC correction τCC is shown with the thin dotted
line whereas the sum τW + τCC is displayed with the (blue)
dotted line. Bottom: the CC correction τCC (thin dotted line)
is compared with the atomic and Wigner time delay diﬀerence
τa − τW from the TDSE calcualtions with the LHF and OEP
potentials (shown with the red ﬁlled and black open circles).

Wigner time delay from the RPAE calculation for the
individual 2s and 2p shells and their diﬀerence. On the
bottom panel, the Wigner time delay diﬀerence is aug-
mented by that of the CC correction. We assume that
the CC correction τCC is a universal function of the pho-
toelectron energy and as such the CC correction diﬀer-
ence between shells at the same photon energy is caused
by their varying ionization potentials. The atomic time
delay diﬀerence

τa(2s) − τa(2p) = τW(2s) − τW(2p)

(19)

+ τCC(2s) − τCC(2p)

is compared with the RABBITT measurement and the
RPA calculation presented in [11]. We see that both cal-
culations (almost indistinguishable in the scale of the ﬁg-
ure) reproduce the measurement [11] very well. In con-
trast, the older measurement [12] deviates from the the-
oretical predictions by nearly a factor of 2.

τW(2s) − τW(2p) (red solid line) is augmented by the CC cor-

which is compared with the calculated result of Isinger et al.

B. Argon 3p shell

The β parameters for the Ar 3p shell extracted from
the angular dependence of the high harmonic peaks and
sidebands are shown in Fig. 7. The TDSE calculations
performed with the LHF and OEP potentials are shown
on the top and bottom panels, respectively. The three
sets of β parameters are compared with the RPAE calcu-
lation and the experiment [31]. We observe from this ﬁg-
ure that all three sets of β parameters extracted from the
TDSE calculation with the LHF potential follow closely
the RPAE prediction and agree with the experiment. At
the same time, the OEP TDSE results are displaced rel-
ative to the RPAE in the photon energy scale by as much
as 10 eV. This mismatch is a reﬂection of the displace-
ment of the CM position in the photoionization cross-
section. This position can be located very accurately
from the squared radial integral [32]

CM position is misplaced for each of the potentials except
the LHF. Subsequently, in the following, we present our

In Fig. 9 we compare β2 and β4 parameters as mea-

On the top panel we compare β2 and βHH derived from
the main harmonic peaks while on the bottom panel we
display β2, β4 as measured directly from the SB ampli-
tude and as expressed via βSB(A) and βSB(B) in Eq. (11).

We see that the β4 parameters compare rather favourably
whereas the β2 parameters are a bit higher than in the
experiment.

FIG. 9: (Color online) Top: the anisotropy parameters de-
rived from the angular variation of the high harmonic peaks.
The two sets of experimental values β2 from [3] are shown by
open circles with error bars. The synchrotron measurement
[33] is shown with black dots. The orange triangles connected
with solid line visualize βHH from the LHF TDSE calcula-
tion whereas the black solid line displays the RPAE result.
Bottom: the experimental β2 and β4 parameters are shown
by the same symbols as on the top panel. The same param-
eters extracted from the LHF TDSE calculation are shown
with purple triangles (derived from A parameter) and blue
asterisks (B parameter).

The angular variations of the atomic time delay ∆τa =
τa(θk) − τa(0) in various sidebands of the Ar 3p RAB-
BITT trace, and the Wigner time delay angular varia-
tion ∆τW = τW(θk) − τW(0) at the same photon ener-
gies, are displayed in Fig. 10 (top and bottom panels
respectively). In stark contrast to the analogous set of
data for Ne 2p shown in Fig. 4, the angular variation
of the Wigner time delay for Ar 3p is of the same order
of magnitude, and is almost identical for SB30 near the
CM. As a reference, in both panels of Fig. 10, the LOPT
calculation [4] for SB32 is shown. Beyond the CM (SB48
and SB60), the angular variation of the Wigner time de-
lay ﬂattens whereas the same variation of the atomic time
delay changes its sign and simultaneously lessens in mag-
nitude.

In Fig. 11 we compare the angular variation of the
atomic time delay ∆τa = τa(θk)−τa(0) in SB14 (top) and
SB16. In the experiment [3], SB16 is tuned in resonance
with the 4s−15p autoionizing state while SB14 is oﬀ the

FIG. 10: (Color online) Top: angular variation of the atomic
time delay ∆τa = τa(θk) − τa(0) in various sidebands of the
Ar 3p RABBITT trace calculated with the LHF potential.
Bottom: angular variation of the Wigner time delay ∆τW =
τW(θk) − τW(0) from the XUV-only RPAE calculation. The
angular variation of time delay for SB32 from [4] is shown for
comparison.

FIG. 11: (Color online) Same as Fig. 10 for SB14 (top) and
SB16 (bottom). Two sets of measurements from [3] are shown
by open circles with error bars. The LOPT result from the
same work is visualized by a dashed line. The LHF TDSE
result is shown with orange triangles connected by the solid
line. The bottom panel also shows the calculation from [3]
which includes the Fano resonance (black solid line).

resonance. For SB14 we ﬁnd a fairly good agreement be-
tween the experiment and the present LHF TDSE calcu-
lation. The LOPT calculation reported in [3] is also very
close. For SB16 both the TDSE and LOPT calculations
predict considerably weaker angular dependence than in
the experiment and the calculation which accounts for
resonance by the Fano conﬁguration interaction formal-
ism.

Various time delays for the Ar 3p shell in the zero
angle polarization direction are shown in Fig. 12. On
the top panel, we display the atomic time delay τa from
the TDSE LHF calculation, the Wigner time delay τW
from the RPAE calculation, the regularized hydrogenic
CC correction τCC and their sum τW + τCC. We also
show the atomic time delay τa from the LOPT calculation
[4]. The latter is almost indistinguishable from the sum
τW + τCC, but visibly diﬀerent from the TDSE calcula-
tion for τa. On the bottom panel we show the hydrogenic
τCC and the argon speciﬁc value τCC = (φ−
CC)/2ω
obtained from the phases φ±
CC reported in [3]. Both val-
ues, which are remarkably close, are compared with the
diﬀerence τa − τW. Unlike in the Ne 2p case, displayed
on the bottom panel of Fig. 5, these two derivations of
the CC correction give quite diﬀerent results. This dif-
ference may, in principle, be attributed to the diﬀerent
approximations used in TDSE-LHF and RPAE calcula-
tions. The former employes a localized version of the
HF potential and neglects the correlation while the lat-

CC − φ+

ter gives the full account to the exchange and inter-shell
correlation. However, the same calculations return quite
similar sets of β parameters. As such it is more likely
that the hydrogenic approximation to τCC breaks for the
argon 3p shell.

This break down may have implications to theoretical
interpretation of the time delay diﬀerence in the valence
shell of Ar shown in Fig. 13. Here the atomic time delay
diﬀerence

τa(3s) − τa(3p) = τW(3s) − τW(3p)

(21)

+ τCC(3s) − τCC(3p)

is computed with the hydrogenic CC corrections and
compared with the RABBITT measurement [10]. As
τCC(3p) deduced from the present TDSE calculation is
more negative by about 20 as near the 40 eV mark as
compared to the hydrogenic estimate, the atomic time
delay diﬀerence estimated from Eq. (21) will be shifted
upwards by the same amount.
It will make the dis-
agreement with the measurement [10] even worse. The
present TDSE calculation is not able to give an estimate
to τCC(3s) as ionization of this shell is strongly corre-
lated with that of the valence 3p shell and goes beyond
the SAE approximation.

C. Krypton 4p shell

We test validity of various eﬀective potentials for Kr
by determining the CM position in the 4p photoioniza-
tion cross-section. We do so by comparing the squared
radial integrals (20) calculated with the bound state 4p
orbital and the continuous d-wave obtained from the ra-
dial Schr¨odinger equation Eq. (3). This comparison is
shown in Fig. 14. Unlike in the case of Ar 3p photoion-
ization, illustrated in Fig. 8, the CM position calculated
in the HF and RPAE diﬀers by nearly 20 eV. This is
so because of the inﬂuence of the inter-shell correlation
between the 4p and 3d shells and which is accounted for
in the RPAE but not in the HF calculation. This cor-
relation is absent in the case of Ar 3p as the 3d shell is
vacant for this atom. The CM position calculated with
the LHF and MD potentials is in between the HF and
RPAE whereas the OEP calculation displaces the CM to
lower energies very signiﬁcantly. We discard the OEP in
the following.

The three sets of angular anisotropy β parameters ex-
tracted from the high harmonic peaks and the side bands
are shown in Fig. 15 calculated with the LHF (top) and
MD (bottom) potentials. We see that agreement between
the TDSE and RPAE calculations is generally good but
these calculations diverge at higher photon energies. This
occurs well below the 3d threshold whose position can
be identiﬁed by the converging autoionization resonances
visible in the RPAE curve. The experiment [34] clearly
favors the RPAE calculation. Partial agreement between
the TDSE calculations with the LHF and MD poten-

by the CC correction diﬀerence τCC(3s) − τCC(3p) (dotted
line) to get the atomic time delay diﬀerence τa(3s) − τa(3p)
(blue dashed line).

fortuitous given a strong deviation of the TDSE binding

Should the β parameters in Fig. 15 be plotted versus the

This tendency of deviation of the TDSE calculations
with various local potentials from the RPAE and exper-
iment is aggravated further in Xe. As an illustration,
we show in Fig. 16 the CM position deduced from the
squared radial integral (20). Firstly, we observe that the
HF and RPAE results diverge by as much as 40 eV. This
is a clear sign of a very strong correlation between the
5p and 4d shells accounted for in the RPAE but missing
in the HF. Second, both the LHF and OEP give the CM
position which is displaced by 20 eV from the RPAE for
the same reason.

It is well known that missing the inter-shell correlation
between the 5p and 4d shells in Xe has a profound eﬀect
on the anisotropy β parameter. It becomes strongly dis-
placed relative to the experiment as shown graphically in
Fig. 1 of [35]. We therefore do not expect any reasonable
agreement of the presently employed TDSE/SAE model
with the experiment either.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We presented a series of simulations and their anal-
ysis for the angular dependent RABBITT traces in the
valence shells of noble gas atoms from Ne to Xe. Our
simulations are based on numerical solutions of the one-
electron TDSE driven with the XUV ionizing ﬁeld and
the IR probing pulse. Exchange between the departing

photoelectron and the ionized atomic core is accounted
for by various eﬀective one-electron potentials. The ac-
curacy of this account is tested by making comparison
with the Hartree-Fock approximation which includes the
exchange by constriction. The inter-shell correlation be-
tween the valence np and sub-valent ns, (n − 1)d shells
are neglected in a one-electron TDSE. To elucidate the
strength of this correlation, we compare the TDSE results
with the RPAE calculation which is known to account
for the inter-shell correlation very accurately. However,
the RPAE is unable to account for ultrafast electron dy-
namics and designed for much slower ionization processes
initiated by long pulses of synchrotron radiation.

We focus our analysis on the anisotropy β parameter
which is extracted from the angular dependence of the
high harmonic peaks as well as sideband RABBITT os-
cillation amplitude A and B factors. Within the scope
of the soft photon approximation, all the three sets of β
should be in agreement which was found to be the case.
This streamlines considerably the analysis of a angular
resolved RABBITT measurement and makes redundant
the introduction of multiple sets of angular anisotropy
parameters which was made by Cirelli et al. [3]. The
phase of the RABBITT oscillation is converted to the
angular dependent time delay which is compared with
the RPAE calculations. The time delay in the polariza-
tion direction is used to test accuracy of the hydrogenic
CC correction.

Our results can be broadly categorized into the two
groups. In lighter atoms, Ne and Ar, the single active
electron model is generally valid. The Ne calculations
are particularly robust with all the tested eﬀective po-
tentials producing accurate results close to the RPAE
predictions both for the angular anisotropy and the time
delay. In Ar, because of the appearance of the Cooper
minimum, the TDSE calculations become very sensitive
to the choice of the eﬀective potential and a simple ana-
lytic ﬁt to the localized HF potential produces the best
results for β parameters. At the same time, this calcula-
tion suggests deviation of the CC correction from the reg-

  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ularized hydrogenic expression. Because of the Cooper
minimum, the angular variation of the Wigner time de-
lay is of the same magnitude as the that variation of the
atomic time delay. In Ne, the angular variation of the
Wigner time delay is negligible.

In heavier atoms, in Kr and particularly in Xe, the
inter-shell correlation between the valence np-shell and
sub-valent (n−1)d shell becomes very strong. In Kr, with
some choice of eﬀective potentials, the present model can
return sensible Cooper minimum position and β param-
eters away from the (n − 1)d shell threshold. In Xe, no
eﬀective potential is expected to replace the strong eﬀect
of inter-shell correlation and the present model is gener-
ally invalid.

Our ﬁndings are of importance to the theoretical anal-
ysis of angular resolved RABBITT measurements. Par-
ticularly that there is a linear dependence of the β2 and
β4 parameters which can be derived from the single set
describing the whole RABBITT measurement, both the
high harmonic peaks and the side bands. This set can
be easily compared with predictions of the RPAE theory
which is valid for all noble gas atoms. These β parameters
can also be tested against the XUV only measurements
[29, 31, 33–35].

This work is a step forward in resolving the persistent
controversy in the time delay measurement in Ar [10].
However, as the measurement involved both the valence
3p and the sub-valent 3s shells, we are unable to conclu-
sively do so. The 3s shell in argon is strongly correlated
with the 3p shell and this inter-shell correlation goes be-
yond the scope of the present model.

The model, as it stands now, can be applied to the
sub-valent Kr 3d and Xe 4d shells which are not ef-
fected strongly by inter-shell correlation with outer va-
lence shells. The nd correlation with inner core is only
noticeable near corresponding deeper thresholds. We can
also easily incorporate the eﬀect of a fullerene cage [36]
to model a RABBITT process in encapsulated atoms.
Eventually, we will attempt to generalize our model to
account for inter-shell correlation. This will require con-
siderable development of the existing one-electron TDSE
code.

Appendix: RABBITT in soft photon approximation

We start from Eqs. (10) and (11) of Maquet and Ta¨ıeb
[20] and write the amplitude of the XUV photon absorp-
tion modulated by absorption (+) or emission (−) of n IR
photons as

+∞

S =

Snδ(k2/2 − E0 − ωx − nω)

(A1 )

n=−∞
X

Sn = −2πiJ−n(a0 · kn) exp[−i(φx + nφ)]hkn|ǫ · ∇|ii

with kn ≃ [2(E0 + ωx + nω)]1/2 being the shifted mo-
mentum of the photoelectron and ωx, φx and ω, φ as the
XUV and IR frequencies and phase shifts respectively.
Here the matrix element hkn|ǫ · ∇|ii of the XUV photon
absorption is written in the velocity gauge.

In RABBITT we are only interested in the n = 1 and
n = −1 sidebands. Their corresponding amplitudes are

S±1 ≡ M(±)

k±1 = −2πiJ∓1(a0 · k±1)

(A2 )

× exp[∓iφ±

CC]hk±1|ǫ · ∇|ii .

Here we introduced the phase φ±
CC associated with the
continuum-continuum transition in absorption or emis-
sion of an IR photon. For simplicity we have dropped the
XUV phase φx and thus neglected the harmonic group
delay. Using the transformation J−n = (−1)nJn we write

S+1 + S−1 =

We can relate the phases of the dipole matrix elements
with the soft photon shifted momenta by the phase en-
ergy derivative,

Further, we assume J1(α0 · k±1) ≈ J1(α0 · k) and subse-
quently ﬁnd the magnitude of the RABBITT signal (8)
