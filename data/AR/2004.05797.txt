ABSTRACT

Aims. To perform a detailed analysis to understand the evolution and dynamics of propagating intensity disturbances observed in a
fan loop system.
Methods. We perform multiwavelength time-distance analysis of a fan loop system anchored in an isolated sunspot region (AR 12553).
The active region was observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We measure the
phase speeds of the propagating intensity disturbances by employing cross-correlation analysis, as well as by obtaining the slopes in
xt-plots. We obtain original as well as de-trended light curves at diﬀerent heights of the time-distance maps and characterize them by
performing Fouriér and Wavelet analysis, respectively.
Results. The time-distance maps reveal clear propagation of intensity oscillations in all the coronal EUV channels except AIA 94
and 335 Å. We determine the nature of the intensity disturbances as slow magneto-acoustic waves by measuring their phase speeds.
The time-distance maps, as well as the de-trended light curves, show an increase and decrease in the amplitude of propagating 3-min
oscillations over time. The amplitude variations appear most prominent in AIA 171 Å, though other EUV channels also show such
signatures. Fouriér power spectrum yield the presence of signiﬁcant powers with several nearby frequencies between 2–3 minutes (5–
8 mHz), along with many other smaller peaks between 2–4 minutes. Wavelet analysis shows an increase and decrease of oscillating
power around 3-min simultaneous to the amplitude variations. We obtain the modulation period to be in the range of 20–30 minutes.
Conclusions. Our results provide the viability of occurrence of phenomenon like ‘Beat’ among the nearby frequencies giving rise to
the observed amplitude modulation. However, we can not at this stage rule out the possibility that the modulation may be driven by
variability of an underlying unknown source.

1. Introduction

Identiﬁcation and characterization of magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) waves and oscillations are major thrust areas of research
in the ﬁeld of solar plasma-astrophysics. MHD waves are con-
sidered to be an important candidate for heating of the solar at-
mosphere (Erdélyi 2004; Ofman 2005; Taroyan & Erdélyi 2009;
Rajaguru et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2019). They may have signiﬁcant
roles in triggering of jets (De Pontieu et al. 2004; Chandra et al.
2015) as well as in the acceleration of fast solar wind (Cranmer
2009).

One of the wave modes observed in the solar corona is slow
mode magneto-acoustic waves. The propagation of this wave
mode is largely conﬁned to the magnetic ﬁeld direction. They
are compressional in nature, and propagate with speed that is
less than the local sound speed in the solar corona. Such waves
are often observed as ﬂuctuations in intensity as well as in
Doppler velocity (Wang et al. 2009; Gupta et al. 2012). These
waves were ﬁrst reported as propagating intensity disturbances
(PIDs) by Ofman et al. (1997) in coronal plumes in oﬀ-limb ob-

servations recorded by the UltraViolet Coronagraph Spectrom-
eter (UVCS, Kohl et al. 1995) on-board the Solar and Helio-
spheric Observatory (SOHO). Similar intensity oscillations in
coronal fan loops were ﬁrst detected by Berghmans & Clette
(1999) using the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT,
Delaboudinière et al. 1995) on board SOHO in 195 Å channel,
and later conﬁrmed by De Moortel et al. (2000) in the obser-
vations recorded by Transition Region and Coronal Explorer
(TRACE, Handy et al. 1999) in the 171 Å channel. Fan loops
are magnetic plasma structures in the corona with temperature
between 0.6–1 MK (Reale 2010; Ghosh et al. 2017). They are
found at the edges of active regions, and are mostly rooted in
the umbra and umbra-penumbra boundaries of sunspots. They
also remain anchored to the penumbra and non-sunspot (such
as, plage) regions. From a statistical study, Kiddie et al. (2012)
concluded that PIDs of sunspot origin are temperature dependent
and have subsonic propagation speed.

Since the discovery of PIDs in coronal fan loops, a num-
ber of theoretical and observational studies have been per-

formed to unravel their characteristics, propagation and dissipa-
tion and also their counterparts in the lower solar atmosphere
(see, e.g., Nakariakov et al. 2000; De Moortel et al. 2002a,c;
Roberts 2006; De Moortel 2009; Bogdan 2000; Bogdan & Judge
2006; Khomenko & Collados 2015). Using wavelet analysis,
De Moortel et al. (2002b) found that the periods of the PID are
of the order of 282 ± 93 s. However, careful observation of their
footpoint locations showed that the coronal fan loops rooted in
sunspot regions have a dominant period of 172 ± 32 s, and the
loops rooted in non-sunspot regions, such as plages are dominant
in 321 ± 74 s period oscillations. This distinction was explained
in terms of the underlying driver at the photospheric level, excit-
ing the loop footpoints.

In addition to the regular 3-min and 5-min oscillation,
few studies have reported longer-period oscillations in the fan
loops. Wang et al. (2009) has reported longer-period propagat-
ing waves at around 12 and 25 minutes along a fan-like coro-
nal structure in the intensity (see also Marsh et al. 2009) and
Doppler shift of the Fe XII 195 Å line using EUV Imag-
ing Spectrometer (EIS, Culhane et al. 2007) on-board HINODE
(Kosugi et al. 2007). Stenborg et al. (2011) showed the presence
of waves in multiples of 8 minutes in coronal fan loops such
as, in 16-min, 24-min, 40-min etc. It was speculated that the
presence of the 8-min period could be attributed to beat phe-
nomenon, which may occur due to the superposition of ubiqui-
tous 3-min chromospheric and 5-min photospheric oscillations
that leak into the corona through the inclined guide ﬁeld that is
provided by fan loops. However, they did not emphasise the ex-
citation mechanisms of other longer-period oscillations that they
detected in their observations.

In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of intensity
perturbations propagating along a fan loop system anchored
within a sunspot. We track the evolution of these intensity os-
cillations by using the high spatially and temporally resolved
data recorded by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA,
Lemen et al. 2012) on-board the Solar Dynamic Observatory
(SDO, Pesnell et al. 2012). Our motivation is to understand how
intensity oscillations with a range of periodicities interact, and
aﬀect the propagation characteristics of most dominant 3-min
oscillations along fan loops. The rest of the paper is structured
as follows. In Section 2, we describe the observations obtained
for this study and brieﬂy address the data reduction and prepara-
tion. We present the details of the diﬀerent analyses acquired in
this study, such as time-distance maps, Fouriér analysis, wavelet
analysis and respective results in Section 3. Finally, we sum-
marise our ﬁndings and conclude in Section 4.

2. Observations

The main aim of this work is to perform a multi-wavelength
study of the dynamics of a fan loop system. For this purpose
we have utilised the observations recorded by AIA using its UV
channel, AIA 1600 Å and all the EUV channels, AIA 304 Å,
171 Å, 131 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å, 335 Å, and 94 Å. These chan-
nels are dominated with diﬀerent spectral lines formed in a
range of temperatures. For more information on the tempera-
ture sensitivity of diﬀerent channels see O’Dwyer et al. (2010),
Del Zanna et al. (2011), and Boerner et al. (2012). AIA provides
full disk images with a cadence of 12 s in EUV and 24 s in
UV. In addition, for contextual purpose, we use continuum data
obtained using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI,
Schou et al. 2012a,b), also on-board SDO. The AIA and HMI
data are processed using standard processing software provided

Article number, page 2 of 13

in the solar software (SSW; Freeland & Handy 1998) distribu-
tion. The processed level 1.5 AIA and HMI data provides a pixel
resolution of 0.6′′.

The fan loop system, which is studied here, belongs to the
active region NOAA AR 12553 observed on June 16, 2016. We
have analysed the AIA observations recorded between 07:30:10
to 10:30:10 UT. We note that all the observations taken in dif-
ferent channels are rotated/de-rotated to the reference time at
9:15:00 UT for further analysis. Panel (a) in Fig. 1 displays a
portion of the Sun’s disk image including AR 12553 observed
in 171 Å passband. The yellow box encloses the fan loop sys-
tem named as region of interest, a zoom-up of which is shown in
panel (b).

3. Data Analysis and Results

In Fig. 2, we plot the regions of interest observed from HMI
and AIA. Panels (a) and (b) show the HMI intensity and line-
of-sight [LOS] magnetogram, respectively. The magnetogram
is displayed within the magnetic ﬁeld range of ±1000 G (with
white indicating positive polarity and black indicating negative
polarity). Panel (c) to (i) are taken by AIA in passband as la-
belled. The over-plotted cyan inner and yellow outer contours are
plotted to visualise the umbra-penumbra and penumbra-plage
boundaries, respectively. The umbra-penumbra contour is at the
level of 38000 DN, whereas the penumbra-plage boundary is at
the level of 53000 DN based on HMI continuum image. These
contours are further over-plotted on the UV and EUV intensity
images obtained in 1600 Å and 171 Å, shown in panels (c) and
(e). Panel (e) reveals that some fan loops are rooted deep inside
the umbra, and some are at the umbra-penumbra boundary.

Since our primary motivation is to study the wave dynamics
of steady fan loops, we focus on the region that does not suﬀer
from any ﬂaring activity. With this condition in mind, we lo-
cated three diﬀerent regions on the fan loop system with white
boxes, as shown in the panel (a) of Fig. 3 and studied the corre-
sponding light curves over the following three-hour period. The
resultant light curves are shown in panel (b) of Fig.3. The light
curves are normalized with respect to the maximum intensities
of each curve. The light curves conspicuously give the impres-
sion that the fan loop system does not show evolution more than
10% from the mean. Therefore, these could be considered for
our study. The blue light curve taken from a location along fan
loop 3 indicates some background intensity enhancement from
time to time.

In order to study the existence and propagation of intensity
disturbances along the fan loops, we employ time-distance anal-
ysis and construct artiﬁcial slits (slits 1, 2 and 3) along the three
fan loops as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 3. We choose 171 Å image
for the identiﬁcation of fan loops as they are best seen at temper-
ature of log [T/K] = 5.80 (e.g., Brooks et al. 2011; Ghosh et al.
2017). We note that each slit is four pixels wide. We further
emphasise that this analysis could be performed using one slit.
However, to check the consistency of the results, we have used
three diﬀerent slits along diﬀerent fan loops anchored in the um-
bra of the sunspot (see panel (a) in Fig. 3). We describe the re-
sults for slit 1 in the following, and provide the results for slits 2
and 3 in the Appendix for brevity.

3.1. Time-distance maps

ridges are observed up to a distance of 8-10′′ (5.90-7.35 Mm)
along the slit.

locations considered for obtaining the light curves for further analysis. The slanted yellow line along the propagating feature is used to estimate
average projected speed.

Fig. 5 displays the time-distance maps obtained along slit 1
from other AIA EUV channels as labelled. The PIDs are clearly
discernible in all the EUV channels of AIA except for channels
like 335 Å, and 94 Å, which are formed above a temperature of
2.5 MK. In AIA 193 Å, the PIDs are observed up to a distance
of 8-10′′ (5.9-7.35 Mm) similar to 171 Å channel of AIA. How-
ever, in channels such as 131 Å, and 211 Å the PIDs are only
seen upto a distance of around 4′′ (2.9 Mm). The time-distance
maps also reveal a decrease in the signal strength of the propa-
gating features as they travel along the loops, which indicates a
reduction in their amplitude of oscillations (≈ 10% to 5%).

To perform a quantitative analysis on the propagation of the
intensity disturbances, we obtain light curves at diﬀerent pro-
jected heights from the origin of the slit. The yellow dashed lines
in Figs. 4 and 5 highlight the locations chosen to receive the
light curves. We denote the locations by L1, L2, L3, and L4 that
correspond to 1.2′′, 3.0′′, 4.8′′, and 6.6′′, respectively. We note
that the light curves are obtained from the absolute, unprocessed
time-distance maps. We show such light curves in 171 Å for a
few projected heights in Fig. 6 (left column). In the right column
of Fig. 6, we plot corresponding de-trended light curves. The
over-plotted blue lines on the original light curves indicate the

Although the phase speeds obtained above by manually
drawing slopes provides a feasible estimate of the phase
speeds, it is subjected to errors due to its user-dependent na-
ture. Therefore, in order to avoid the human bias associated
with this method, we employ a technique that provides phase
speeds by cross-correlating the light curves obtained at dif-
ferent heights (e.g., Gupta et al. 2010; Kiddie et al. 2012). The
cross-correlation yields the time lag corresponding to the maxi-
mum cross-correlation coeﬃcient and thereby the phase speeds.
We carry out this analysis by using the standard IDL routine
c_correlate. For this purpose, we consider the de-trended light
curves obtained at locations L1 and L2 (marked by yellow
dashed lines in Figs. 4 and 5). We emphasise that the analysis
carried out with the original light curves also gives similar time
lags.

The cross-correlation curves obtained for diﬀerent AIA EUV
channels are shown in Fig. 7. The obtained phase speeds are
given in Table 1 against diﬀerent time-lags observed in diﬀerent
EUV channels. For comparison, we have also listed the phase
speeds achieved using the ridges of time-distance maps. We note
that the obtained phase speeds using both the methods are in
agreement within the errors.

The obtained phase speeds are not the true speed but pro-
jected speeds in the plane of sky, as mentioned earlier. In order
to measure the true phase speed, we need an estimate of the incli-
nation angle (the angle between the line of sight and the guided
magnetic ﬁeld along which the wave propagates). The true phase
speed is then obtained from the measured projected phase speed
divided by the sine of the inclination angle. Since we do not have
direct measurement of the inclination angle of the guide ﬁeld, we
consider a range of possible angles varying between 10◦ to 90◦
and estimate the respective true phase speeds for diﬀerent AIA
channels. Our ﬁndings show that the true phase speeds remain
close to the sound speed in corona1. The sound speed for 1 MK
coronal plasma is around 140 km s−1. As an example, we dis-
cuss the estimated true phase speeds of the PIDs in AIA 171 Å
channel considering diﬀerent inclination angles in the Appendix
A. The phase speeds of the PIDs closer to the speed of sound
suggest that they are slow mode magneto-acoustic waves.

3.3. Amplitudemodulationobserved in AIA 171 Å

The de-trended light curves in 171 Å (Fig. 6) reveal a peculiar
oscillatory pattern. We ﬁnd the clear presence of an amplitude
modulation with an overall increase and decrease of the wave
pattern over time. The modulation is discernible even in the time-
distance map shown in Fig. 4 in terms of brightness.

In order to understand the modulation in more details, we
have obtained the frequency components responsible for such
patterns using Fouriér analysis and studied their evolution using
wavelet analysis (Torrence & Compo 1998).

3.3.1. Fouriér Analysis

Fig. 8 displays the normalised Fouriér power spectra derived
from the original light curves for the locations L1 – L4 in Fig. 4
(marked by yellow dashed lines). The power in the panels is nor-
malised with respect to the maximum power obtained at location
L1. The power spectra of all the locations indicate three domi-
nant peaks within 5 – 6 mHz (3.33 – 2.78 minutes). They are at
around 5.26 mHz (3.17-min, marked as f2 in Fig. 8), 5.56 mHz

1 The speed of sound in the solar corona is given by 0.14T 1/2 km s−1
with T measured in kelvin [K] (see Aschwanden 2004)

background trends, which are obtained from a running average
over 30 minutes. We see that 30-min running average describe
the low-frequency background very well. We then, subtract the
background trends from the respective original light curves to
obtain the de-trended light curves. The de-trended light curves
provide a very clear, evident, and unperturbed evolution of the
intensity. We use the de-trended light curves for further studies.

3.2. Phase speeds of the PropagatingIntensity Oscillations

Before going into the details of the analysis, we intend to char-
acterize the PIDs in terms of their phase speeds, as its measure-
ments play a vital role in understanding their nature. To obtain
the phase speeds, we employ two methods. In one method, we
obtain the phase speeds by obtaining the slopes of the ridges ob-
served in the time-distance plots. We draw multiple slopes (more
than 20) along the propagating ridges by visual inspection and
obtained the average propagation speed. The over-plotted yel-
low and white slanted lines in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate the slopes
used to measure the average projected phase speeds of the PIDs.
We obtain the average projected phase speeds along slit 1 as
50.0 ± 9.0 km s−1 for 171 Å, 50.0 ± 10.0 km s−1 for 131 Å,
57.7 ± 10.0 km s−1 for 193 Å, and 49.0 ± 13.6 km s−1 for 211 Å.
The noted errors are the standard deviation obtained using mul-
tiple slopes.

(3.00-min, marked as f3), and 5.83 mHz (2.85-min, marked as
f4). In addition, there are other smaller peaks identiﬁed at around
4.99 mHz (3.34-min, f1), 6.11 mHz (2.72-min, f5), 6.84 mHz
(2.44-min, f6) and 7.42 mHz (2.24-min, f7). The vertical dashed
black lines mark these peaks. We also observe a decrease in the
power of the frequency peaks as we go away from the footpoint
of the fan loop.

The observations of several nearby frequencies in the power
spectra led us to postulate that the phenomenon of beat may play
a role to generate the amplitude modulation. The beat is a phe-
nomenon which occurs when two waves of slightly diﬀerent fre-
quencies, say, f1 and f2, interfere giving rise to a resulting wave
undergoing amplitude modulations with frequency, fb = f1-f2.
We call this frequency, ‘fb’, as beat frequency. In the current ob-
servations, assuming the interaction of the three dominant fre-
quency components (f2, f3, and f4) observed in Fig. 8, we ﬁnd
that for frequency components 5.26 mHz (f2) and 5.83 mHz (f4),
there is a beat frequency fb = 0.57 mHz, i.e.,≈ 29-min. We note

that the 29-min is close to the modulation period that we obtain
from a simple visual inspection of the detrended light curves in
Fig. 6 (see also section 3.3.2).

The other combinations give us fb = 0.30 mHz (≈ 55-min) for
5.26 mHz (f2) and 5.56 mHz (f3) and fb = 0.27 mHz (≈ 61.70-
min) for 5.56 mHz (f3) and 5.83 mHz (f4). Similarly, the inter-
ference of the dominant frequency around 5.56 mHz (3-min.)
with those of frequencies at around 4.99 mHz (f1), 6.11 mHz
(f5), 6.84 mHz (f6), and 7.42 mHz (f7), give rise to beat fre-
quencies of around 0.57 mHz (29-min), 0.55 mHz (30-min), 1.28
mHz (13-min), and 1.86 mHz (8.96-min), respectively. However,
we note that in the dynamic and complex solar atmosphere, it is
diﬃcult to explain the observed period of amplitude modulation
in terms of a particular beat period as the propagation becomes
aﬀected by all the frequency components. Krishna Prasad et al.
(2015) observed amplitude modulation in the Fouriér-ﬁltered
light curves with a mean period of 20 – 27 minutes, and re-
ported the possibility of occurrence of the beat. We note that

presence of dominant power peak (P1) at around 3-min period
for all the locations. We obtain second power peaks (P2) around
57.68-min. and 44.48-min. for locations L1 and L2, and at 28.84-
min and 20.30-min for locations L3 and L4, respectively. We see
that these second power peaks are below the 99% conﬁdence
level, therefore unreliable.

To quantify the modulation period, we follow a particu-
lar approach (Krishna Prasad et al. 2015; Sharma et al. 2017).
We see that it is the 3-min wave amplitude that is modulated.
The Fouriér Power Spectrums (Fig. 8) also illustrate signiﬁ-
cant power within 2 to 4 minutes, with dominant peaks around
3-min. Inspecting the power within 2 to 4 minutes, we mea-
sure the wavelet oscillatory power averaged within this period
range. This oscillatory power will essentially mimic an ampli-
tude variation that would be caused by all the waves having
periods within the 2 and 4-minute range (Sharma et al. 2017;
Krishna Prasad et al. 2015; Sych et al. 2012). Then, we apply
wavelet to the obtained amplitude variation to estimate the dom-
inant period of amplitude modulation. Fig. 10 shows wavelet
power spectrums obtained in such way for AIA 171 Å for lo-
cations, as done for Fig. 9. We obtain the dominant/ﬁrst power
peaks (P1) around 34.30-min, 20.39-min, 22.24-min, and 26.45-
min for locations L1, L2, L3, and L4, respectively. We ﬁnd the
longer-period power peaks above the 99% conﬁdence level for
all the marked locations of Fig. 4. We emphasise that we ﬁnd
similar results with the unﬁltered, original light curves.

3.4. Amplitudemodulationin other AIA EUV channels

For completeness, we study the light curves obtained from other
AIA EUV channels at the locations shown by over-plotted yel-
low dashed lines of Fig. 5. We de-trended the light curves in a
similar way as was done for those obtained from 171 Å and per-
formed further analysis. In Fig. 11, we present the wavelet analy-
sis results obtained using light curve at L1 for 193 Å (left panels)
and 211 Å (right panels). The power is concentrated at a period
(P1) around 3-min, and undergo an increase and decrease over
time, as can be seen in the panels (b) of Fig. 11. To quantify the
modulation period, we approached the similar method as done
for AIA 171 Å (described in the last paragraph of 3.3.2). We
obtain the dominant power peaks (P1) around 22.24-min, 20.39-
min for 193 Å and 211 Å respectively The analysis of 131 Å
showed similar behaviour and provided the dominant modula-
tion period around 22.24-min However, we emphasize that the
modulation is best seen in AIA 171 Å.

3.5. AIA 1600 Å and 304 Å observations at the footpointof

the fanloop

To investigate the origin of the modulation shown by the prop-
agating slow MHD waves in AIA EUV channels, we study the
footpoint of the fan loop in AIA 1600 Å and 304 Å. Fig. 12
shows an AIA 1600 Å image with the footpoint of the fan loop
obtained from AIA 171 Å traced by slit 1. A yellow box bounds
the footpoint location situated in the sunspot umbra. The size of

large-period oscillations with periods of around 8-min, 12-min,
24-min, 40-min, 63.4-min in coronal fan loops have also been
reported before by Wang et al. (2009); Stenborg et al. (2011).
However, no observational pieces of evidence were provided to
answer their origin.

3.3.2. Wavelet Analysis

To study the temporal variation of the frequency, we perform
wavelet analysis on the 30-min de-trended 171 Å light curves
obtained at locations marked in Fig. 4. For this purpose, we use
the Morlet wavelet as the basis function, which is a plane wave
multiplied by a gaussian, and convolve it with the light curves
(Torrence & Compo 1998). In Fig. 9, we plot the wavelet results
for the light curves obtained at locations, L1 (left panel) and L3
(right panel). Each wavelet plot consists of three panels. The de-
trended light curve used for wavelet analysis is displayed on top
panel (a). The wavelet power spectrum that shows the variation
of power at diﬀerent periods with time is plotted in the bottom
left panel (b). The global wavelet power spectrum, obtained by
taking the average over the time domain of the wavelet trans-
form, is plotted in the bottom right panel (c). In each wavelet
spectrum (lower left panel), we denote a cross-hatched region
called the cone-of-inﬂuence (COI). The COI region appears be-
cause of the edge eﬀects which arises due to the ﬁnite-length of
time series. Any estimate of the oscillation period in this region
becomes unreliable. The horizontal dashed lines in the global
wavelet panels show the longest period that can be detected due
to COI. We mention the ﬁrst two power peaks (P1 and P2) ob-
tained from the global wavelet at the right top corner of the
wavelet plots.

In the wavelet spectrum panels, we ﬁnd that most of the os-
cillating power lies in the range 2–4 minutes throughout the ob-
served duration. We also observe an increase and decrease in the
wavelet power, which is co-temporal with the appearance and
disappearance of the modulations observed in the corresponding
light curves. As expected, the global wavelet spectra show the

note that we detect the high-frequency components in 90% con-
ﬁdence level. Therefore further observational work is required to
establish the viability of this ﬁnding.

3.6. Observation of highfrequency component

Besides the modulation, we observe some high-frequency oscil-
lations around 1.5-min (≈ 11 mHz) in the wavelet power maps
(panel b). We show zoomed up versions of the wavelet power
panels (b) in Fig. 14 for diﬀerent AIA channels as labelled.
Such powers are observed at the footpoint of the fan loop in the
sunspot umbra (Fig. 12) at 304 Å, and at location L1 of the fan
loops for the coronal channels 171 Å, 193 Å, and 211 Å. How-
ever, they are not present throughout the time-series. Besides, we

4. Summary and Conclusions

In this work, we have studied the nature of PIDs observed in an
active region fan loop system rooted in a sunspot umbra using
AIA/SDO observations. We ﬁnd that the PIDs are best observed
in 171 Å data. The PIDs were also seen in other channels of AIA
except for 335 Å and 94 Å. We have measured the phase speeds
of the PIDs in all the AIA channels and found that the phase
speeds are subsonic. This is suggestive that these are slow mode

magneto-acoustic waves. We further found that the phase speeds
measured in diﬀerent channels are not dependent on tempera-
ture. This is in contradiction with the results obtained by, e.g.,
Banerjee et al. (2009); Krishna Prasad et al. (2012); Kiddie et al.
(2012); Gupta (2014). A possible reason for this may be the
broad temperature response of the AIA channels. Fan loops are
structures of typically 1 MK; therefore it may be that the emis-
sions from the lower-temperature components are contributing to
these diﬀerent AIA EUV emissions (Ghosh et al. 2017), thereby
giving similar phase speeds.

Our result shows that the PIDs have longer detection length
(≈ 5.9 − 7.35 Mm) in 171 Å and 193 Å, whereas a shorter de-
tection length (≈ 2.9 Mm) in 131 Å and 211 Å. The similar
detection length in 171 and 193 Å could be due to the similar
temperature range covered by both these channels. We note that
AIA 131 Å has a peak formation temperature closer to that of
171 Å in quiet conditions. Therefore, the shorter detection length
observed in 131 Å may be due to the weaker signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) (< 10) than that of 171 Å (> 65). The shorter detection
length observed in 211 Å channel may also be related to its SNR,
which we ﬁnd to be less than 20.

and right panels are from 304 Å. Diﬀerent panels are explained in Fig. 9.

(c-d) are from Fig. 11.

The light curves obtained at multiple locations along the
loops show an increase and decrease in the amplitude of os-
cillations over time. Such variation is better seen in the de-
trended light curves (see Fig. 6). Fouriér analysis on the orig-
inal light curves reveals that there are several nearby frequen-
cies within 5–8 mHz. The ﬁndings obtained here suggest that
beat may be a possibility behind the observed amplitude mod-
ulation that are very likely created due to the interference of
the nearby frequency components. We observe similar frequency
peaks in all the AIA EUV coronal (except AIA 335 Å and
94 Å) as well as chromospheric channels. Lites (1986) has re-
ported the various frequencies peaks identiﬁed in our study
in chromospheric umbra, and Fludra (2001) reported them in
transition region sunspot plumes. Centeno et al. (2006, 2009);
Krishna Prasad et al. (2015) observed the presence of amplitude
modulations in Fouríer ﬁltered light curves and measured a mod-

ulation period of 20-27 minutes (Krishna Prasad et al. 2015).
However, in our study, the amplitude modulations were promi-
nent enough to detect them prior to any ﬁltration (Fig. 6), which
to our knowledge is the ﬁrst such observational ﬁnding. Wavelet
analysis also reveals an increase and decrease of the oscilla-
tion power around 3-min simultaneous to the observed ampli-
tude modulation. We obtain the modulation period to be in the
range 20-30 minutes.

Observation of similar amplitude variation at the lower so-
lar atmosphere (right panels of Fig. 13) as observed by AIA
304 Å (log [T/K] = 4.7, Lemen et al. (2012)) supports one
more possibility that may be the amplitude variability is caused
by the underlying driver. Photospheric p-modes are, in gen-
eral, assumed to be the cause of propagating slow magnetoa-
coustic waves observed in the corona (De Pontieu et al. 2005;
Krishna Prasad et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2016). Hence, the ampli-

tude variability of the p-mode may aﬀect and give rise to the
particular amplitude variation of the propagating intensity waves
observed along the fan loop. Observational studies have shown
the eﬀect oscillatory phenomenon in the lower solar atmosphere
on the propagation of slow-magnetoacoustic waves along coro-
nal fanloops (Jess et al. 2012; Sharma et al. 2017). However, fur-
ther study is required both observationally and theoretically to
understand the origin of such amplitude modulation in time se-
ries.

In addition to the amplitude modulation, we see presence
of low period (high frequency) oscillations around 1.5-min
(11 mHz) (see Fig. 14) in this study. We observe these high-
frequency oscillations both at the chromospheric and coronal
heights. Wang et al. (2018) ﬁrst observed high-frequency os-
cillations by imaging observations at diﬀerent heights above
sunspot umbra in the range 10 – 14 mHz (around 1-min.). They
related such high-frequency modes at coronal heights to per-
turbations at photospheric umbra. Krishna Prasad et al. (2017)
reported frequencies around 13 mHz using IRIS 2796 Å in
chromospheric sunspot umbra. We note that the observed high-
frequency around 11 mHz is close to the double of the domi-
nant (fundamental) frequency at around 5.56 mHz, and hence
is similar to the second harmonics. However, one needs to be
cautious to associate the high-frequency modes observed in our
study to second harmonics, as harmonics are so far, observed in
standing waves in coronal closed loops (Srivastava & Dwivedi
2010). Verwichte et al. (2004) reported the detection of higher
harmonics in coronal kink wave oscillations with a deviation
in the frequency ratio of second to ﬁrst harmonics from its
canonical value of 2 in a homogeneous medium. Andries et al.
(2005); Erdélyi & Verth (2007); Luna-Cardozo et al. (2012) pro-
posed that such deviation may occur because of longitudinal
density and or magnetic stratiﬁcation along stratiﬁed expanding
ﬂux tubes like those in the corona, and therefore can be used as
a seismological tool to measure the density scale height.

Appendix B : PIDs along slits 2 and 3

Fig. .1. Time-distance maps obtained along slits 2, and 3 in AIA 171 Å.
Clear propagation of intensity oscillations along the slits are observed.
The region averaged between the overlaid yellow dashed lines are taken
for further analysis.

We analyze the evolution of intensity disturbances propagat-
ing along slits 2 and 3 (shown in Figure 3-a). We ﬁnd the 3-min
propagating intensity oscillations along slits 2 and 3 undergoing
amplitude modulations. However, modulations were not strong
enough as observed for slit 1. Figures .2 and .3 present the in-
crease and decrease of wavelet power of the 3-min oscillations
representing the modulations.
