Abstract 

The origin of ultralow friction and high wear resistance in ultrananocrystalline diamond 

(UNCD) films is still under active debate because of the perplexed tribochemistry at the sliding 

interface. Herein, we report a comparative study on surface topography and nanoscale friction of 

tribofilms, in wear tracks of two sets of UNCD films having different structural characteristics. 

Despite both the films display ultralow coefficient of friction, the UNCD films grown under Ar 

atmosphere (UNCDAr) exhibit a high wear resistance while the wear rate is higher for the films 

grown  in  N2  (UNCDN).  Frictional  force  microscopic  (FFM)  investigations  clearly  reveal  the 

manifestation  of  shear  induced  graphitization  on  both  the  films.  However,  the  wear  track  of 

UNCDAr films have a large network of a few layer graphene (FLG) structures over the amorphous 

carbon tribofilms while only isolated clusters of FLG structures are present in the wear track of 

UNCDN films.  Here, we demonstrate the direct micro-/nanoscopic evidence for the formation of 

large  network  of  ~  0.8  -  6  nm  thick  FLG  structures,  as  a  consequence  of  shear  induced 

graphitization and discuss their decisive role in ultralow friction and wear.

1. Introduction 

Friction and wear are one of the major challenges in  mechanical  assembly  systems  and 

they lead to significant energy loss and frequent device failure. The materials with anti-wear and 

ultralow  friction  characteristics  are  the  most  desirable  in  mechanical  engineering  applications 

where the carbon based materials have potentials to play a major role. Since ultralow friction and 

negligible  wear  are  demonstrated  in  ultrananocrystalline  diamond  (UNCD)  and  diamond-like 

carbon (DLC) films at ambient conditions, the research interest is ever increasing drastically over 

the recent past years [1,2,11–20,3,21–30,4,31–34,5–10]. The formation of tribofilms which occurs 

due to the shear induced graphitization is one of the crucial factors for achieving ultralow friction 

in carbon materials [5,10,20–26,35]. Especially when the tribofilm consists of layered structures 

e.g. a few layer graphene (FLG), the friction becomes vanishingly low [7,31–33,36]. Since the 2D 

layered materials have outstanding structural, chemical, physical and mechanical properties due to 

the  strong  in-plane  interactions  and  very  weak  van  der  Waals  out  of  plane  interactions,  these 

materials become highly attractive for tribological applications, apart from the well demonstrated 

novel  electronic  and  optoelectronic  applications  [37,38].  Apart  from  graphene  layers, 

carbon/graphene quantum dots, graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide, nanodiamonds and other 

2D materials such as hexagonal BN, MoS2, NbSe2 and WS2 have shown remarkably low friction 

and wear that encourages to use them as solid lubricants in tribology [13,38–41]. 

There are numerous reports available in the literature on the factors affecting the ultralow 

friction and wear of UNCD and DLC films.  Among them, the surface roughness of tribo-contacts, 

contact  pressure,  tribo-environment,  crystalline  orientation,  structural  defects,  mechanical 

properties, and surface chemistry – passivation by functionalization or the formation of secondary 

phase tribofilms due to tribo-chemical reactions  at the sliding interface play significant role on 

2 

 
 
 
tribological  properties  [14–20].  The  chemical  and  microstructure  analysis  of  the  tribofilm  can 

provide  invaluable  information  about  the  tribochemical  reactions  at  the  interface  and  the  wear 

mechanism.  Despite  significant  knowledge  gained  over  the  period,  the  microscopic  origin  of 

ultralow  friction  and  wear  in  UNCD  films  are  still  not  well  understood.    The  most  acceptable 

postulates on ultralow friction and wear in UNCD and DLC are either due to surface passivation 

or rehybridization. Of them, the surface passivation is reasonably explained on the superlubricity 

in UNCD and DLC films based on tribotests at different environments [3–5,21,22]. On the other 

hand  the  surface  rehybridization,  which  occurs  through  the  shear  pressure  leading  to  either 

amorphization or graphitization,  is a complex phenomenon  at atomic-scale  with  bond  breaking 

and re-bonding at the sliding interface.  

The shear induced graphitization is mostly verified experimentally by observation of sp2 

and sp1 rich a-C in  the tribofilms  which are studied by several  analytical  tools such as  Raman 

spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron energy loss 

spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption 

fine  structures  [10,18,20,22–26,35].  Recently,  in-situ  Raman  tribometry  has  given  tremendous 

support in understanding the tribochemical reactions at the sliding interface [10]. However, the 

obtained information is not limited to surface alone but includes a significant contribution from 

bulk and also, the spatial resolution is poor.   While XPS is a well-known surface sensitive tool, it 

offers average information over a wide area and limits the knowledge at micro-/nano-scopic scale 

[4,18,20,23]. Moreover, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and tip-enhanced Raman 

spectroscopy (TERS) are well established as surface sensitive tools with much improved lateral 

resolution  as  compared to  conventional  Raman spectroscopy.  Despite  the SERS and TERS are 

well-established  for  detection  of  single  molecular  level  and  have  high  potential  for  intensive 

3 

 
tribological analysis at molecular level, the usage of these techniques are very limited until now 

[42].   

In-situ  and  post  wear  HRTEM  and  EELS  studies  had  shown  evidences  on  the 

rehybridization of UNCD into sp2- and sp1-rich amorphous carbon (a-C) embedded with small sp2 

crystallites of ~ 1 nm, fullerene-like structures and graphene nanoscroll which are attributed to the 

superlubricity [2,6,10,23,25–27,35]. However, there are no direct microscopic evidence of large 

size  two  dimensional  (2D)  graphene  structures  in  the  tribofilms.  Also,  molecular  dynamic 

simulations  by  different  groups  had  predicted  superlubricity  on  UNCD  and  DLC  films. 

Nevertheless, the superlubricity is achievable only when the formation of 2D graphene layers are 

considered at the sliding interface with minimum of two or more layers [8,24,28–30]. Based on 

the experimental assumptions and theoretical predictions, there are several reports on  usage of a 

few layer graphene (FLG) structures as a solid lubricants and it has been demonstrated reduction 

in wear and friction on various types of tribo-couples including superlubricity on carbon materials 

[7,31–33,36].  Thus, 2D graphene layers are well proved for their effectiveness in protecting the 

surface and minimizing friction.  

Even  though  the  concept  of  2D  graphene  layer  formation  on  tribofilms  through  shear 

induced graphitization is well recognized by both experimental and theoretical simulations, it is 

surprising  to  note  here  that  direct  micro-/nanoscopic  evidences  for  the  formation  of  layered 

graphene structures on tribotrack are still lacking in literature [27,34]. This is mainly because of 

the  challenges  in  distinguishing  the  atomically  thin  layers  from  rough  wear  track  by  the 

conventional microscopic techniques. Interestingly, atomic force microscope (AFM) can play a 

major role in studying the tribofilms since it  can work from  hundreds of micrometers down to 

atomic-scale. In addition, it also has several functional capabilities such as studying friction, elastic

modulus, electrical and magnetic properties. Further, the frictional force microscope (FFM) has 

been explored in probing friction of carbon based materials and several other layered structures at 

nanometer-scale  [36,39,43–45].  Since  the  coefficient  of  friction  (CoF)  is  different  for  various 

carboneous materials, a combined mapping of surface topography and friction using FFM would 

provide  information  about  the  tribofilms  in  the  wear  track.  Table  1  provides  the  performance 

comparison of different analytical techniques for surface analysis of materials. As evident from 

the  Table  1,  AFM  based  techniques  have  an  edge  over  other  techniques  for  surface  analysis, 

especially for carbon materials.

In the present study, we report AFM based nanoscale  friction  analysis and evolution of 

ordered graphene layers over the a-C tribofilms in the wear track of two different sets of UNCD 

films  grown  under  Ar  and  N2  atmospheres.  These  UNCD  films  were  pre-studied  with  various 

macroscale measurements such as Raman spectroscopy, HRTEM, EELS and XPS [6]. Herein, our 

FFM study provides a direct micro-/nanoscopic evidence for the formation of 2D graphene layers 

through shear induced graphitization and these secondary phases have distinct friction behavior 

compared to the a-C tribofilm matrix. Moreover, these layered graphene structures play a decisive 

role on the ultralow friction and wear in these UNCD films.   

2. Experimental  

Two sets of UNCD films grown under Ar and N2 atmospheres (labeled as UNCDAr and 

UNCDN,  respectively)  are  considered  for  the  study.  The  physical  and  macroscopic  tribological 

properties  of  the  films  are  reported  elsewhere  [6].  Herein,  in  order  to  understand  the  origin  of 

ultralow friction and wear,  a systematic nanoscale friction analysis is performed using FFM inside 

the wear track that were run for different sliding distances, viz. 30, 100 and 500 m for UNCDAr 

and 2.5, 100, and 500 m for UNCDN films. Topography and friction force images are acquired 

simultaneously using AFM ( NT-MDT, Russia) with soft Si cantilevers of ~ 350 m length and ~ 

0.05 N/m spring constant. AFM measurements are repeated with typical scan area of ~ 40 x 100 

m2 over a section across the wear track whose width is about 255 and 310 m for UNCDN and 

UNCDAr films, respectively. Further, FFM measurements are repeated on several locations in the 

wear track encompassing FLG nanostructures at different AFM tip normal load. In addition, the 

local  elastic  modulus  of  unworn  and  worn  out  surfaces  are  estimated  by  measuring  contact 

resonance  frequency  (CRF)  using  stiff  Si  cantilevers  in  atomic  force  acoustic  microscopy 

(AFAM).  The  experimental  details  of  AFAM  and  estimation  of  elastic  modulus  can  be  found 

6 

 
elsewhere [46–48]. A typical normal load of ~ 1 nN and 1 N is applied on AFM tip for FFM and 

AFAM measurements respectively, unless otherwise specifically mentioned in the text.  

3. Results  

Before  going  into  the  FFM  study,  a  brief  summary  of  previous  results  is  valuable.  The 

macroscale tribometric studies reveal that the UNCDAr films exhibit an ultrahigh wear resistance 

with average saturated CoF of ~ 0.08. Further, it is observed that the CoF is higher ( ~ 0.27 ) during 

the  initial  stage  of  sliding  and  it  gradually  decreases  to  lower  value  (0.08)  after  a  long  run-in 

distance of about 100 m. On the other hand, UNCDN films have ultralow friction with saturated 

CoF of ~ 0.04 with negligible run-in distance, however, the wear rate is relatively higher compared 

to UNCDAr films. Also, the hardness (elastic modulus) of pristine UNCDAr and UNCDN films is 

found to be ~ 23 (215 GPa) and 14.8 (165 GPa) GPa respectively, as measured by nanoindentation. 

Based on Raman spectroscopy,  HRTEM, EELS   and XPS  analysis, the  pristine  UNCDAr  films 

were  found  to  have  higher  sp3/sp2  ratio  with  thin  a-C  layer  at  grain  boundaries  (GBs)  while 

diamond grains are encapsulated with thick nanographitic layers at GBs of pristine UNCDN films 

[6]. In addition, the post wear analysis of the tribo tracks by the above mentioned techniques clearly 

revealed the presence of tribofilms with excess amount of graphitic phase [6] but they could not 

provide a conclusive remark for the difference in the tribological properties of these UNCD films.

distance. The arrow marks in Fig. 1(e,g,i)  represent the presence of FLG structures which are not obviously 

visible due to a large height variation in the matrix. However, the presence of FLG can be obviously noticed 

in the corresponding friction images of Fig. 1(f,h,j) with much lower friction values. The height profiles 

across a FLG structures marked as P1 and P2 in Fig.1g and 1i are given in Fig. 1k and 1l, respectively. The 

double arrow marks in the images (a, c, e, g, i) indicate the sliding direction. Scale bar = 20 m for the 

images in 1a-1f. The angle between the graphene edges are found to be ~ 90 and 120o as marked in the 

Fig.1j.

topography  (FFM)  represent  the  objects  with  maximum  and  minimum  height  (friction  force), 

respectively. The wear track of UNCDAr film is partially worn out after 30 m run-in distance, as 

shown in Fig. 1a and the wear scratches introduce very high root mean square (rms) roughness of 

22.4 nm, measured over the entire image. The partially worn out surfaces have lower friction as 

compared  to  pristine  surface,  as  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  1b.  After  a  sliding  distance  of  100  m,  the 

surface of wear track is slightly smoothened due to the movement of tribofilms (rms roughness = 

16.9 nm) as depicted Fig.1c. The Fig. 1d shows the FFM image of the corresponding area in the 

wear track that displays both low and high friction areas. A careful observation of the magnified 

part of the topography ( Fig. 1g) reveals the presence of secondary phase, over the tribofilm matrix, 

as isolated bright batches with nearly flat top surface at an elevated height of (3.0 ± 1.0) nm and 

few hundreds of nanometer in lateral size in the wear track. Here, the error value is obtained from 

statistical mean of height measured on multiple particles. The corresponding FFM mapping (Fig. 

1h)  also  displays  dark  regions  (indicating  lower  friction  force)  wherever  secondary  phases  are 

present in the tribofilms and a few such areas are marked as circles in Fig. 1h. The height profile 

of one such cluster labelled as P1 in Fig. 1g is shown in Fig. 1k and it has the height of ~ 2 nm 

with a flat top surface and sharp edges at the periphery. 

Figures 1e, 1i and 1f, 1j are topography and friction images respectively, recorded at two 

different  locations  in  wear  track  of  UNCDAr  films  that  ran  for  500  m  sliding  distance.  The 

topographic images become more textured due to the wear ball induced scratches along the wear 

direction and the formation of tribofilms which move normal to the sliding direction, as can be 

evidenced in Fig.1e and 1i. The calculated rms roughness is found to be 24.7 and 7.2 nm for the 

wear  track  shown  in  Fig.1e  and  1i,  respectively.  Further,  Fig.  1i  shows  prominent  and  large 

networks of 2D nanoribbon like structures with height of ~ (3 ± 2.0) nm and length > 15 µm.  The 

9 

 
width  of  the  nanoribbons  varies  from  ~  1  to  10  m.  A  careful  look  at  Fig.  1e  also  reveals  the 

presence of similar 2D nanoribbon networks and they are indicated by arrow marks as guide to 

eye. The presence of such 2D nanoribbons make striking difference in corresponding FFM images 

with  lowest friction values (dark regions) as illustrated by arrow marks in Figs. 1f and 1j. The 

Fig.1l shows the height profile of one such nanoribbon indicated by an arrow in Fig.1i at position 

P2. The height and width of the nanoribbons are 4 nm and 1.8 m, respectively. In addition, these 

2D nanoribbon structures are mostly oriented along the sliding direction and a few branches are 

noticed  in  normal  to  the  sliding  direction.  Apart  from  the  large  networks  of  2D  nanoribbon 

structures, there are also smaller clusters with unique friction characteristics in the wear track that 

was formed with 500 m sliding distance. On the other hand, such secondary phase nanoclusters or 

2D  nanoribbon  structures  with  unique  low  friction  characteristics  are  not  detected  on  the  wear 

track of UNCDAr films for the sliding distance of 30 m, even though UNCDAr films had undergone 

mild wear at this sliding distance.  We note here that the observation of 2D structures with atomic 

step  height  and  flat  top  surface  suggest  the  signature  of  FLG  structures  [36].  Moreover,  the 

observation  of  low  friction  on  the  FLG  structures  reaffirms  the  presence  of  layered  graphitic 

structure which is well known for low friction [36,39,43,49].  Here, the typical thickness of 2 nm 

indicates  that  the  FLG  structures  have  about  5  atomic  layers  of  graphene  since  the  monolayer 

graphene has the thickness of ~ 0.34 nm.  

Figure  2a  (2c)  ((2e))  and  2b  (2d)  ((2f))  depict  the  topography  and  friction  images 

respectively,  in  the  wear  track  of  UNCDN  films  that  ran  for    2.5  m  (100  m)  ((500  m))  sliding 

distances. The rms roughness of the wear track is about 27.9, 27.1 and 86.2 nm for sliding distance 

of 2.5, 100 and 500 m, respectively. The surface of the UNCDN films undergo smoothening even 

after the sliding distance of 2.5 m (Fig. 2a). With increasing the sliding distance to 100 m, the

topography becomes much rougher with  movement of tribofilms normal to the sliding direction 

(Fig.2c).    After  500  m  sliding,  the  wear  track  appears  smooth  due  to  the  rearrangement  of 

tribofilms. However, the depth of trenches induced by the roughness of the wear ball is higher 

(Fig.2e) compared to that observed at shorter sliding distance. A magnified part of the topography 

and  friction  images  of  the  wear  tracks  are  shown  in  Fig.  2g-2l.  There  is  no  signature  of  FLG 

secondary phases in the magnified part of the topography (Fig.2g) and friction mapping (Fig.2h) 

of wear track after 2.5 m sliding distance. After 100 m sliding distance, the friction mapping (Fig. 

2d and 2j) contains large number density of dark spots indicating lower friction areas in the wear 

track, that can be attributed to the presence of graphitic nanoclusters which are not obviously seen 

from topography (Fig. 2c). However, the magnified part of the topography confirms the presence 

of FLG nanoclusters with large number density in the wear track. Similarly a large amount of FLG 

nanoclusters are also present in the wear track that ran for 500 m sliding distance (Fig 2k, 2m). 

Figures 2o and 2p (2q and 2r) show the line profile of height and friction force recorded on 

selected  FLG  structures  marked  as  L1  and  L2  (  L3  and  L4)  in  the  Fig.2i  and  Figs.  2l  &  2n, 

respectively  on  the  wear  track  of  100  m  (500  m)  siding  distance.  Moreover,  based  on  height 

measurements, the average height and lateral size of the nanoclusters are ~ (5.0 ± 3.0) nm  [(4 ± 

2.5) nm] and (250 ± 50) nm [(600 ± 300) nm] for sliding distance of 100 m [500 m] , respectively. 

These  FLG  nanostructures  with  uniform  diameter  are  homogeneously  distributed  over  entire 

region of the wear track after sliding for 100 m while the FLGs are inhomogeneously distributed 

over entire region of the track after 500 m sliding distance.  

For  nanoscale  friction  analysis  of  these  FLG  nanostructures,  FFM  measurements  were 

performed on selected area by varying normal load. Sequence of friction images were recorded at 

constant normal load over a selected area and for each image, the normal load on AFM cantilever

in the selected region (Fig. 3e, 3f). We also note here that the friction force signal was collected 

twice in each specified location viz. during the forward and reverse scan of AFM tip and the net 

friction force mapping was constructed by subtracting one from the other. Subsequently, the

in Fig. 3j, the friction force increases as a function of normal load for both FLG nanoclusters and 

the a-C tribofilm matrix. The increase in friction is attributed to the puckering effect which arises 

due to elastic deformation of the FLG structures with increase in normal load [36,39]. The weak 

Van der Waals force between the graphene layers allows puckering which results in reduction of 

lateral dimension of the FLG structures, as can be seen from Fig. 3d. Based on the slope of 10 and 

27.7 (unnormalized), the relative CoF of FLG structure is about three times lower than the matrix 

in the track. A similar analysis is also performed for the wear track of UNCDN (500 m) and the 

plot is shown in Fig. 4. The height of the FLG structure is 4 nm, comprising 10 layers of graphene. 

In this wear track also the friction force increases with normal load. The slopes of the curves for 

FLG structures (low friction areas) and matrix (high friction areas) are found to be 3.1 and 5.4 

respectively.  As similar to UNCDAr films, the relative CoF is lower for FLG structures in UNCDN 

as  compared  to  the  matrix.  In  addition,  the  relative  CoF  of  FLG  structures  and  the  matrix  in 

UNCDN films is ~ 3 and 5 times lower than that of UNCDAr films, respectively. These results are 

consistent with macroscopic tribo measurements which shows the average saturated CoF of ~ 0.08 

and 0.04 for UNCDAr and UNCDN films [6]. 

Further, the layered nature of the newly formed FLG structures and their binding on the 

tribofilms in the wear track are tested by measuring topography and friction mapping at slightly 

higher normal load on the cantilever. Fig. 5a and 5d show the simultaneously measured topography 

and friction force mapping on wear track of UNCDAr (500 m) at a normal load of 4 nN on the 

cantilever. As discussed earlier, the FLG structures have lower friction (darker area) as compared 

to the tribofilm of the matrix. Also, some part of the FLG structures (arrow mark in Fig. 5a) have 

already started peeling off and it is also reflected as bright areas in the FFM mapping (arrow mark 

in Fig. 5d). Subsequent imaging at higher load of 10 nN on the same location reveals that the FLG  

15 

 
 
Fig.  5.  Simultaneously  acquired  topography  and  friction  mapping  on  a  few  layer  graphene  structures. 

Mappings are recorded at normal load of 2 nN for the images given in 5a,5c,5d, and 5f,  and at 10 nN for 

the images in 5b an 5e. The rectangle symbol on Fig. 5f indicates the previously AFM measured area at 

higher load of 10 nN. The line profile of (g) height and (h) lateral force measured along the line marked in

structures are completely removed from the matrix as can be seen from Fig. 5b. It is also noticed 

that  the  previously  known  low  friction  area  (darker  regions)  switches  into  higher  friction  area 

(bright regions in  Fig. 5e) immediately after the removal of FLGs.   Moreover, the bright areas 

(high friction regions) on right side ligament of the Y junction (Fig. 5d) indicate that the partial 

FLG structures are peeled off during the forward scan, which is not reflected in the topography 

(Fig. 5a), but it shows the effect on friction force image. In order to verify the flipping of friction 

from low to high upon removal of FLG structures, an additional FFM measurement at 2 nN normal 

load was performed on larger area encompassing the previously measured area, and the topography 

and FFM image are shown in Fig. 5c and 5f, respectively. This measurement confirms the lower 

friction of FLG when the physical structure is intact (upper part of Fig 5c). Subsequently, after the 

FLG structures are physically removed, the underneath area becomes even higher in friction than

the matrix. Since the friction measurements were performed immediately after removal of FLGs, 

the newly exposed area exhibits high friction due to inherent nature of the tribofilms which consist 

of  highly  disordered  a-C  with  a  large  amount  of  dangling  bonds  that  increase  the  friction.  In 

contrast, the smaller dimension FLG structures that are present on the wear track are not being 

completely removed, as compared to large networks of FLG.  However, at higher normal load on 

AFM tip, the smaller FLG structures undergo mechanical deformation as can be seen in Fig. 3c 

and Fig. 4c. 

Further, the adhesion behavior of the newly formed 2D structures are measured on wear 

track of UNCDAr film by varying the tip scan velocity under constant normal loads of 1 and 8 nN.  

Fig. 6a and 6b depict the topography and friction mapping respectively, measured in the wear track  

Fig. 6. Simultaneously acquired topography (a) and friction (b) mapping on a few layer graphene structures, 

measured  at  normal  load  of  1  nN.  The  height  of  the  individual  structure  is  ~  1.6,  0.8,  2.4  and  2.0  nm 

respectively, from left to right. The variation of lateral force as a function of AFM tip scan velocity at (c) 1

at normal load of 1 nN. Here, the friction is lower on the 2D structures as compared to matrix a-C 

tribolayer.    Further,  sequence  of  friction  images  were  recorded  at  constant  normal  load  over  a 

selected area and for each image, the AFM tip scan velocity is varied from 0.5 to 5 m/s. Then, 

histogram is constructed for each friction image to extract the average lateral force on the low and 

friction areas for different scan velocities.   Fig. 6c and 6d show the variation of lateral force as a 

function of scan velocity at normal load of 1 and 8 nN, respectively.  As can be seen from Fig. 6c 

& 6d, the low and high friction areas display negative and positive slope for friction as a function 

of scan velocity. The negative slope of friction in the FLG nanocluster is attributed to meniscus 

force which arises due to the condensation water molecules between tip and sample surface. The 

slower  scan  rate  increases  the  contact  area  leading  to  higher  friction  and  also,  this  behavior 

indicates hydrophilic nature of the FLG nanoclusters. On the other hand, the positive friction is 

associated with the hydrophobic character of a-C matrix which is similar to earlier report [50]. 

Though  the  friction  measurements  could  not  be  performed  under  higher  scan  velocity  due  to 

structural deformation of FLG, this observation clearly reveals the different surface chemistry of 

FLG structures and a-C matrix.  In addition, the elastic properties also influence the tribological 

properties  and  hence,  the  elastic  properties  of  these  UNCD  films  and  tribolayers  are  measured 

using AFAM and are discussed below. 

3.2 Atomic force acoustic microscopy  

Atomic force acoustic microscopy is a versatile technique to probe local elastic properties 

of materials at nanometer-scale. In AFAM measurements, the sample is mounted on a piezoelectric 

transducer which generates ultrasound frequencies upto 5 MHz. When the sample is vibrated at a 

drive frequency, the AFM cantilever, in contact with sample, is also forced to vibrate at contact 

resonance frequency (CRF) which mainly depends on the elastic modulus of the tip and sample, 

18 

 
and contact load on the AFM tip. By analyzing CRF, the elastic modulus of the samples can be 

calculated using the equation (1) when the cantilever properties are known [46].  

  ………………….. (1) 

where, Es and Eref  are the elastic modulus of unknown and reference sample, respectively.  The 

  and 

  are  the  effective  contact  stiffness  parameter  of  unknown  and  reference  samples, 

respectively;  Also, 

, depends on the contact  resonance  frequency of tip-sample in 

collective vibration (

) of the cantilever in air. Fig. 7 shows 

the CRF spectra of the pristine UNCDAr, UNCDN films and Si (100) wafer (reference). Based on

equation 1 and Eref  of 170 GPa for Si (100), the elastic modulus of the UNCDAr, and UNCDN films 

is estimated to be 184 ± 10 and 163 ± 10 GPa, respectively. The estimated elastic modulus of the 

films is almost close to the value of 215 and 165 GPa respectively, measured by nanoindentation 

[6]. In order to have better understanding on the local elastic modulus of the tribofilms, the matrix 

and FLG structures in the wear track, AFAM CRF mapping was employed and the  results are 

discussed below.    

Figures 8a and 8b (8c and 8d) display the simultaneously acquired topography and CRF 

mapping respectively, on the wear track of UNCDAr (UNCDN) film with 500 m sliding distance.

Similar  to  friction  mapping,  CRF  mapping  (Fig.  8b)  also  displays  both  bright  and  dark  areas 

corresponding  to  high  and  low  elastic  modulus,  respectively.  A  careful  observation  of  the 

topography corresponding to the brighter regions indicates the presence of atomically thin FLG 

structures  which  are  well  known  for  their  lower  elastic  modulus  as  compared  to  other  carbon 

allotropes. The line profiles of height and CRF variation across a FLG structure (marked as A1 

and A2 in Fig. 8b) are given in Fig. 8e and 8f, respectively. The CRF decreases down to 30 kHz 

(~ 2 %) on FLG structures ( ~ 2 nm thickness, as shown in Fig. 8e) compared to the tribofilm in 

the wear track. Note that the observed lower CRF indicates reduction in effective elastic modulus 

of  the  coupled  FLG  structures  and  the  a-C  tribofilm  matrix.  Similar  AFAM  measurements  on 

UNCDN reveal  that only small  clusters having low elastic modulus  are present  inside the wear 

track. The estimated elastic modulus of the tribofilms in the wear track of UNCDAr is larger than 

that of the UNCDN films due to higher sp3 content and the inherent mechanical characteristics of 

the unworn UNCD films. Moreover, a significant amount of mixed low and high elastic modulus 

regions are present in the wear track of UNCDAr films while a homogeneous distribution of elastic 

modulus regions with isolated low elastic modulus are observed in the wear track of UNCDN films. 

Thus, the AFAM studies reveal the variation in elastic modulus of the tribofilms and corroborate 

the FFM studies in terms of distribution of FLG structures in the wear tracks of both the UNCD 

films. 

4. Discussion  

Based on the experimental observation, a brief summary of the results are discussed here. 

The surface topography and friction force mapping unveil that the wear track of UNCDAr films 

consists of a large network of 2D FLG nanoribbons with thickness of ~ (3 ± 2) nm, width and 

length of several micrometers. On the other hand, the wear tracks of UNCDN films only have small 

21 

 
FLG structures with a large number density, thickness of ~ (4 ± 2.5) nm and lateral size of < 1 m. 

Besides, we observe a mixture of bilayer, trilayer and multilayer graphene nanosheets with < 15 

layers  on  the  wear  tracks  of  both  these  UNCD  films  as  confirmed  by  the  atomic  step  height 

measurements by AFM. Nevertheless, the statistical distribution of height analysis suggest that the 

FLG structures in the wear track of UNCDAr films have lower thickness than that of UNCDN films. 

Further,  the  local  friction  is  much  lower  in  specific  areas  in  the  wear  track  wherever  the  FLG 

structures are present. Furthermore, the relative nanoscale CoF of the tribofilms on the wear tracks 

of UNCDN is lower than that of the tribofilms in UNCDAr, as discussed in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. This 

result supports the macroscopic tribo measurements which gives the average saturated CoF of 0.08 

and 0.04 for UNCDAr and UNCDN films, respectively. The lower CoF in UNCDN films can be 

attributed  to  the  presence  of  thicker  FLG  structures  than  in  UNCDAr  films  since  the  CoF  is 

thickness dependent and it is lowest for bulk graphite and increases with decrease in layer thickness 

[38].  

Another important observation is that the local friction in the tribofilms increases when the 

protective FLG structures are removed. This observation endorses that the matrix, the dangling 

bonds  in  the  a-C  tribofilms,  undergoes  surface  passivation  by  termination  of  –H  and  –OH 

functional groups originated from the dissociation of H2O molecules in the ambient atmosphere 

because  of  the  tribochemical  reactions  at  the  sliding  interface  [5,18,51,52].  Especially,  the 

electrostatic repulsion offered by H- termination in diamond or DLC can lead to the superlubricity 

between the counterfaces [52]. Further, the C-H bonding in sp3-rich matrix is more stable than the 

sp2-rich matrix due to the high binding energy.  Moreover, the presence of higher sp3 content in 

tribofilms of UNCDAr films is also reflected as higher elastic modulus than that of the UNCDN 

films, as estimated by AFAM.  Raman spectroscopic studies in the wear track clearly confirm that 

22 

 
UNCDAr has higher sp3 content compared to UNCDN films [6]. Hence, perhaps, the higher sp3 C-

C  bonding  in  the  tribofilms  of  UNCDAr  films  had  also  facilitated  a  more  efficient  surface 

passivation that can result in ultralow friction with a minimum wear rate. In contrast, the higher 

sp2 C=C bonding in the tribofilms of UNCDN films enables the formation of C-OH, C-O or C=O 

bonding that are highly unstable leading to CO or CO2 molecules and make the surface to wear 

out at higher rate. Moreover, it has been recently reported that the in-plane tensile fracture strength 

and  critical  compressive  strain  to  failure  decrease  with  increase  in  layer  thickness  of  graphitic 

structures [53,54]. Thus, the FLG structures with slightly high thickness in UNCDN films undergo 

failure at higher rate than that of tribofilms in UNCDAr films and this makes the wear rate to be 

higher in UNCDN.  

Based on the above discussion, we propose here that large networks of FLG structures act 

as lubricant as well as protecting layer that results in ultralow friction and high wear resistance in 

UNCDAr  films  [7,8,32].  Also,  Wijk  et  al  [8]  predicted  that  the  FLG  act  as  wear  protection  of 

diamond, by preventing further plastic deformation of diamond into a-C. On the other hand, the 

UNCDN  films  have  large  number  density  of  FLG  nanoclusters  which  act  as  efficient  lubricant 

resulting in ultralow friction. However, the high wear rate in UNCDN films can be associated with 

inability  to  form  larger  networks  of  FLG  nanostructures.  Also,  the  adhesion  of  newly  formed 

layered  FLG  structures  over  the  a-C  matrix  tribofilm  is  poor.  This  results  in  the  removal  of 

tribofilms in the wear track leading to a significant wear rate on both the films. However, the higher 

wear rate in UNCDN films than that of the UNCDAr films, can be associated with the tribofilms 

with higher sp2 content which are easily moved out of the track due to the roughness of the counter 

body [3,6].  

23 

 
 
Despite  the  above  discussion,  the  question  remains  that  whether  the  newly  formed  low 

friction structures are few layer graphene or not ? or, is it sp2-rich a-C adlayer since there is no 

alternative direct evidence. Here, we reiterate the following evidences revealed by combined AFM 

and FFM measurements.  

1.  Atomic step height and low friction behavior of FLG structures as shown in Figs. 1- 6.  

2.  Partial cleavage with sharp edges and variation of friction with layer thickness ( Fig. 5) 

3.  Angle between adjacent edges are about 60, 90 and 120o as indicated in Figs. 1 and 5. 

These angles are characteristic of graphene edge chirality that arises due to armchair 

and zigzag edges [55].   

4.  Friction  force  decreases  with  increase  in  AFM  tip  scan  velocity  on  FLG  structures 

while an opposite behavior is observed for a-C matrix (Fig. 6) 

All the above mentioned four points are characteristics of layered graphene structures. Suppose if 

we were to assume the newly formed structure as sp2-rich a-C, it is impossible to cleave the partial 

top layer with sharp edges and also, the friction does not change with thickness. Moreover, the 

adhesion / surface chemistry cannot be opposite to the a-C matrix. Based on these facts, we infer 

that  the  newly  formed  tribolayers  are  indeed  layered  graphene  structures.  However,  a  direct 

measurement like TERS can confirm the layered structure with distinct Raman characteristics of 

FLG structures. Also, HRTEM, scanning tunneling microscopy and Kelvin probe microscopy can 

shed more light  on the layered nature of the FLG. Nevertheless, these techniques do also  have 

several drawbacks to study of lateral tribolayers which are sparsely and randomly present on a 

rough wear track. Yet, AFM is a powerful and relatively simple tool which helps to understand the 

complex wear track with the support of well-established characteristics of carbon materials.   

24 

 
 
Finally, it is very intuitive to know the driving force for the nucleation of ordered graphene 

structures over the tribolayers.  Here, the rms roughness and wear test environments are almost 

identical for both the films, though, the structural characteristics, sp3/sp2 ratio, and hardness are 

different and they might play a significant role on wear and friction. It is mostly accepted that the 

shear force induces sp3-sp2 order – disorder transformation which leads to the formation of sp2-

rich a-C tribolayers at the sliding interface [19]. Further, the shear localization mechanism suggests 

that  rehybridization  occurs  at  the  tribo-interface  with  structural  phase  transformation,  covalent 

bond reorientation and local structural ordering [28]. Thus, the clusters of ordered crystallites with 

~ 1 nm in size nucleate in the a-C matrix which has already been experimentally evidenced by 

HRTEM [2,6,10,35]. However, it was not clear so far that whether these small crystallites grow 

into large size graphene layers or not. In fact, this work by AFM studies provide evidences of the 

growth  of  micro-/nanoclusters  with  ordered  graphene  layers  or  a  large  network  of  graphene 

nanoribbons  in  the  wear  track.  Moreover,  it  should  be  noted  here  that  the  shear  force  induced 

energy dissipation at the sliding interface is very high for UNCDAr films due to the initial high 

CoF along with long run-in distance, high hardness and elastic modulus which are leading to the 

formation of large networked FLG structures. However, the energy dissipation is much lower for 

UNCDN  films  due  to  the  higher  sp2  content  which  makes  negligible  run-in  distance  and  lower 

mechanical properties. Thus, the structural and mechanical properties play a significant role on the 

tribological properties of UNCD films. Also, we cannot rule out the role of H - surface passivation 

of the tribofilms which can play a significant role on friction and wear in UNCD films.   

5. Conclusions  

The formation of bilayer, trilayer, and a few layer graphene-like structures which arise due 

to shear induced graphitization are observed over the amorphous carbon (a-C) tribofilms on two 

25 

 
 
different sets of UNCD films using frictional force microscopy. Since the newly evolved few layer 

graphene structures act as lubricant as well as wear protector, UNCD films with large networked 

few layer graphene structures exhibit high wear resistance with low friction. In contrast, UNCD 

films  only  with  isolated  FLG  structures  display  ultralow  friction  but  it  could  not  protect  wear. 

However, the growth of ordered graphene structures over the tribolayers depends on the structural 

and mechanical characteristics of the UNCD films. In nutshell, the shear induced graphitization 

and the subsequent formation of ordered graphene layers play a major role on the ultralow friction 

and wear in UNCD films. Further, we cannot rule out the effect of H- surface passivation of the 

sp2-rich  a-C  tribofilms  on  friction  and  wear.  Carefully  designed  experiments  are  required  to 

elucidate the driving force behind the formation of a large networks of ordered graphene structures 

since the tribochemical reactions are complex. Moreover, despite the 2D materials have excellent 

frictional properties, they are easily affected by surface conditions, resulting in poor tribological 

results. Intensive study of atomic level friction using emerging 2D materials is need of the hour in 

the field  of tribological  research.  Overall,  the frictional  force microcopy, combined with  other 

macro-scale measurements, can serve as an excellent tool for understanding the tribology of carbon 

materials.
