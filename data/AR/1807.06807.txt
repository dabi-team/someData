Abstract

The source theory provides a straightforward way to obtain the Newton’s potential upon establishing

the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude in quantized Einstein theory of gravity. Here, we use the
same method to derive the gravitational potential of two static point masses in f (R) = R + aR2

Introduction

Source theory, ﬁrst invented and developed by Julian Schwinger, is an alternative formulation of quantum

ﬁeld theory which avoids some of the well-known diﬃculties of the operator formalism. This elegant, powerful

yet economic formalism has been extensively applied to particle physics [1, 2]. It has been also fruitful in

gravitational physics. For example, using the source theory one can derive the Einstein’s gravitational

radiation formula in an economic and elegant way. Utilizing the same formalism, one easily derives the

Newton’s potential for the masses mediating graviton [1-3].

In a recent study the source theory is used to study quantized modiﬁed gravity with Lagrangian density
f (R) = R + aR2 where the vacuum persistence amplitude (or vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude) is
constructed to calculate the average number of emitted gravitons [4]. The so called modiﬁed theories of

gravity, is an attempt to extend the Einstein’s gravitational action to include the terms of higher powers in

curvature tensor [5, 6].
In this letter, we use the vacuum persistence amplitude of f (R) = R + aR2 model to derive the gravitational
energy of two static point-masses. The result is in accordance with the result obtained in [7-9], where the
gravitational potential in quantized f (R) = R+aR2 model is derived by calculating the scattering amplitude
of two massive scaler ﬁelds mediating gravitons. However, as we are going to show, the source theory is a

straightforward method to obtain the static potential even within context of modiﬁed theories of gravity.

Our choice for the signature of Minkowski metric is (

3 Vacuum Persistence Amplitude

In source theory, the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude plays a central role. For the gravitational

theories, its variation with respect to the energy-momentum tensor yields the expectation value of the

We note that the third and forth terms of (4) make no contribution to (8) due to the conservation of

energy-momentum tensor. The ﬁrst of exponent in (8) is reminiscence of the Einstein gravity [1-3], but the
second term appears due to aR2 term of modiﬁed action (1).

result is reported in [7-9] where the static potential is obtained upon invoking the formula (11) by calculating

the fourier transform of the scattering matrix. However, as we demonstrated in this letter, the source theory

method is a rather straightforward way to obtain the gravitational potential.

5 Conclusion

We used the source theory to derive the gravitational potential of two static point-masses in modiﬁed gravity.

The result is in agreement with the result derived using the standard ﬁeld theory calculations.
