ABSTRACT

Aims. To investigate the structure, elemental abundances, physical conditions and the immediate surroundings of supernova remnant
0540-69.3 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
Methods. Imaging in [O iii] and spectroscopic studies through various slits were utilized using European Souther Observatory’s Very
Large and New Technology Telescopes. Densities, temperatures and abundances were estimated applying nebular analysis for various
parts of the remnant.
Results. Several new spectral lines are identiﬁed, both in the pulsar-wind nebula part of the remnant, and in interstellar clouds shocked
by the supernova blast wave. In the pulsar-wind nebula, all lines are redshifted by 440 ± 80 km s−1 with respect to the rest frame of
the host galaxy, and a 3D-representation of the [O iii] emission displays a symmetry axis of ring-like structures which could indicate
that the pulsar shares the same general redshift as the central supernova ejecta. [O ii], [S ii], [Ar iii] and Hβ share a common more
compact structure than [O iii], and possibly [Ne iii]. The average [O iii] temperature in the pulsar-wind nebula is 23 500 ± 1 800 K,
and the electron density derived from [S ii] is typically ∼ 103 cm−3. By mass, the relative elemental abundances of the shocked ejecta
in the pulsar-wind nebula are O : Ne : S : Ar ≈ 1 : 0.07 : 0.10 : 0.02, consistent with explosion models of 13 − 20 M(cid:12) progenitors,
and similar to that of SN 1987A, as is also the explosive mixing of hydrogen and helium into the center. From Hβ and He i λ5876,
the mass ratio of He/H in the center is estimated to be in excess of ∼ 0.8. The rapid cooling of the shocked ejecta could potentially
cause variations in the relative abundances if the ejecta are not fully microscopically mixed, and this is highlighted for S/O for the
period 1989–2006. [O iii] is also seen in presumably freely coasting photoionized ejecta outside the pulsar-wind nebula at inferred
velocities out to well above 2 000 km s−1, and in projection [O iii] is seen out to ∼ 10(cid:48)(cid:48) from the pulsar. This is used to estimate that
the pulsar age is ≈ 1 200 years. The freely coasting [O iii]-emitting ejecta have a strictly non-spherical distribution, and their mass is
estimated to be ∼ 0.12 M(cid:12). A possible outer boundary of oxygen-rich ejecta is seen in [O ii] λλ3726,3729 at ∼ 2 000 − 2 100 km s−1.
Four ﬁlaments of shocked interstellar medium are identiﬁed, and there is a wide range in degree of ionization of iron, from Fe+ to
Fe13+. One ﬁlament belongs to a region also observed in X-rays, and another one has a redshift of 85 ± 30 km s−1 relative to the host.
From this we estimate that the electron density of the [O iii]-emitting gas is ∼ 103 cm−3, and that the line of the most highly ionized
ion, [Fe xiv] λ5303, come from an evaporation zone in connection with the radiatively cooled gas emitting, e.g., [O iii], and not from
immediately behind the blast wave. We do not ﬁnd evidence for nitrogen-enriched ejecta in the south-western part of the remnant, as
was previously suggested. Emission in this region is instead from a severely reddened H ii-region.

1. Introduction

Supernova remnant (SNR) 0540-69.3 (henceforth simply 0540)
has been observed at wavelengths ranging from X-rays to the
radio. Both in the radio and in X-rays. the remnant is bounded by
an outer shell, which has a radius of ∼ 20−35(cid:48)(cid:48) (Manchester et al.
1993b; Gotthelf & Wang 2000). In the optical, the outer shell
coincides with two bright ﬁlaments to the west and southwest
(Mathewson et al. 1980), one emitting [O iii] and the other [N ii],
respectively. As cautioned by these authors, the [N ii] ﬁlament

vatory, La Silla and Paranal, Chile (ESO Programmes 56.C-0731 and
68.D-0394).

may not belong to the remnant, as it coincides with two bright
stars.

Inside the outer shell, the emission from the remnant is con-
centrated to a substantially smaller nebula (Mathewson et al.
1980; Kirshner et al. 1989; Caraveo et al. 1992; Morse 2003;
Seraﬁmovich et al. 2005; Lundqvist et al. 2011). In [O iii] the
diameter of the main emission is ∼ 8(cid:48)(cid:48) (Caraveo et al. 1992).
Henceforth we will refer to this as the ‘central part of the SNR’
(SNRC), and in [S ii] and Hα the observed structures are even
smaller and weaker, decreasing in size and strength in this order.

The SNRC also contains an optical continuum source; this
is synchrotron emission from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN)
(Chanan et al. 1984; Seraﬁmovich et al. 2004; Lundqvist et al.
2011). The synchrotron emission and its spectral characteristics

have been studied throughout the energy range from radio to X-
rays (Seraﬁmovich et al. 2004; Lundqvist et al. 2011; Mignani
et al. 2012; Brantseg et al. 2014; Lundqvist et al. 2020) A PWN
is expected since the remnant harbors the young pulsar (PSR)
B0540-69 whose pulsed emission has been documented in X-
rays (Seward et al. 1984), in the UV (Mignani et al. 2019), in
the optical (Middleditch & Pennypacker 1985), and in the radio
(Manchester et al. 1993a).

The SNRC with its pulsar bears many similarities to the Crab
Nebula, and a detailed discussion and comparison of 0540 with
the Crab pulsar and its PWN can be found in Seraﬁmovich et al.
(2004). However, as revealed by spectral studies in the optical
(Mathewson et al. 1980; Dopita & Tuohy 1984; Kirshner et al.
1989; Morse et al. 2006), the elemental abundances in 0540 are
very diﬀerent from those in the Crab. While the Crab is helium-
rich, but not conspicuous in other respects (MacAlpine et al.
1996), 0540 is dominated by forbidden oxygen and sulphur lines,
and is classiﬁed as an “oxygen-rich SNR” (OSNR). The most
studied object in this class is undoubtedly Cas A, which, how-
ever, is not pulsar-powered, although it contains a neutron star
(Tananbaum 1999; Pavlov et al. 2000). SN 1987A is another
case that is now entering its remnant stage, with an oxygen-
mass of ∼ 1.8 − 1.9 M(cid:12) within its innermost ejecta, i.e., out
to ∼ 2 000 km s−1 (Kozma & Fransson 1998; Jerkstrand et al.
2011). 0540 makes an interesting link between pulsar-powered
remnants in general and OSNRs.

In all the emission lines, projected images on the sky of the
SNRC appear to be concentrated to a few blobs (e.g., Lundqvist
et al. 2011). In addition, spectroscopy of 0540 by Kirshner et al.
(1989) showed that the weighted emission of the SNRC is red-
shifted with respect to the LMC rest velocity. This was further
studied by Morse et al.
(2006) who, however, also revealed a
faint [O iii] “halo" between −1400 and +1900 km s−1, with the
center of expansion close to the systemic velocity of the sur-
rounding H II region. Sandin et al. (2013) used the the integral
ﬁeld unit (IFU) ESO/VLT/VIMOS to probe the 3D structure of
the whole SNRC and found that [O iii] the full velocity range be-
tween −1650 ≤ v[O iii] ≤ +1700 km s−1, where v[O iii] is relative
to the systemic velocity of local LMC redshift. In the plane of
the sky, an [O iii] halo can be traced out to ∼ 8(cid:48)(cid:48) from the pulsar
(Morse et al. 2006) . Williams et al. (2008, who also included in-
frared observations with the Spitzer Space telescope) interpreted
the halo emission to come from photoionized unshocked super-
nova ejecta outside the PWN, but inside the reverse shock of the
SNR. At a distance of 50 kpc, ∼ 8(cid:48)(cid:48) and v[O iii] ≈ 1700 km s−1
would imply an age of ∼ 1.1 × 103 years for 0540, which is less
than the spin down age of the pulsar (1.6 × 103 years, Reynolds
1985).

Spectroscopy and imaging show that there are clear diﬀer-
ences, not only in the size of the SNRC, but also in the struc-
ture of the emitting gas depending on the emission line traced.
In particular, the structures of [O iii] and [S ii] emission have a
very low correlation in the bright southwest part of the SNRC,
while the [S ii] emission correlates well with continuum emis-
sion (Lundqvist et al. 2011). This could be due to diﬀerences
in the ionization structure as a function of position angle, or it
could be diﬀerence in elemental structure.

The 3D structure probed by Sandin et al.

(2013) shows
that [S ii] comes from a more central part, −1200 ≤ v[S ii] ≤
+1200 km s−1, than [O iii] with very weak emission in the
−1200 ≤ v[S ii] ≤ −800 km s−1 range. Sandin et al.
(2013)
used the [S ii] line to make a map of the electron density, ne,
and found that the [S ii] emission mainly comes from regions
with ne <∼ 750 cm−3, although there could be “pockets" with

Article number, page 2 of 30

ne ∼ 2 × 10−3 cm−3. In particular, [S ii] emission is strong from
a speciﬁc feature called “the blob" in our previous papers (Ser-
aﬁmovich et al. 2004, 2005; Lundqvist et al. 2011; Sandin et al.
2013), located ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 3 south-west of the pulsar. This blob is con-
spicuous in continuum emission from radio to X-rays (Lundqvist
et al. 2011, 2020), and De Luca et al. (2007) argued for that the
blob appears to change position and continuum brightness be-
tween 1995 and 2005. Lundqvist et al. (2011) oﬀered the alter-
native explanation, also including optical polarimetry and X-ray
data in their analysis, that a local energy deposition may have
occurred around 1999, and that the emission from that faded un-
til later epochs. Sandin et al. (2013) suggested that the energy
deposition in the blob region could be due to interaction of the
blob with the pulsar-wind torus.

There are also more recent evidence of time-varying emis-
(2019) showed that the sudden
sion from the PWN. Ge et al.
change in the spin-down rate in December 2011 could be linked
to a gradual brightening of the PWN in X-rays by ∼ 30% in
about ∼ 2 years. Lundqvist et al.
(2011) suggested that spa-
tial changes in polarization angle along an axis in the northeast-
southwest direction, and crossing the blob, point to past changes
in activity along this axis. It is intriguing that the presumed pul-
sar jet has been suggested to point nearly orthogonal to this axis
(e.g., Gotthelf & Wang 2000).

Here we report on imaging and spectroscopic observations
of 0540 and its immediate surroundings using NTT/EMMI from
1996 and VLT/FORS from 2002 (Sect. 2 & 3). We also include
results from Sandin et al. (2013). Since our data are deeper than
previously reported spectral studies, our aim is to improve the
knowledge about the spatial velocity distribution of various el-
ements, and on the temperature and ionization of the diﬀerent
parts of the remnant and its neighborhood (Sect. 4). We summa-
rize our conclusions in Sect.5. A preliminary version of parts of
our work was presented in Seraﬁmovich et al. (2005).

2. Observations and data analysis

2.1. NTT Observations

Observations of 0540 were performed on 1996 January 17, using
the 3.58m ESO/NTT equipped with the ESO Multi-Mode Instru-
ment (EMMI). Narrow-band images were obtained in [O iii] λ =
5007 Å at zero velocity using the [O iii]/0 ﬁlter1, and through
the [O iii]/6000 ﬁlter which is shifted to +6000 km s−1 from the
rest wavelength of [O iii]. The pixel size was 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 268×0(cid:48)(cid:48). 268. On
the same night we also carried out low-resolution (2.23 Å/pixel)
long-slit spectroscopy of 0540 in the 3850-8450 Å range using
the EMMI RILD mode with grism#32. The log of the observa-
tions is presented in Table 1. The EMMI [O iii]/0 image of the
0540 neighborhood is shown in Fig. 4, where we also show the
slit position of the NTT spectral observation (marked by “2”).
The position angle of the slit is PA=22◦, and the slit crosses the
SNRC containing the pulsar and the PWN.

2.2. VLT observations

Further spectral observations were carried out in the 3600–
6060 Å range on 2002 January 9 and 10 with the FOcal Re-
ducer/low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS1) on the 8.2m UT3

has a dispersion of 50 Å/mm, or 1.18 Å/pixel. The optical path
also includes a Linear Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector that
compensates for the eﬀects of atmospheric dispersion (Avila
et al. 1997). The spatial scale of the FORS1 CCD is 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 2 per
pixel. On January 9 and 10 we obtained seven and six exposures
of 1320 s each, respectively (see Table 1), i.e., a total exposure
time of 154 and 132 minutes. The position angles, PA=88◦ and
PA=51◦, were the same in all these exposures, and the slit posi-
tions are marked by “1” and “3” in Fig. 1, respectively.

Slits 1 (VLT) and 2 (NTT) were chosen to include the SNRC
and the pulsar. Slit 3 (VLT) does not cross the SNRC, but was
placed west of it to probe the emission from the outer shell that
is most clearly identiﬁed in the Chandra X-ray images (Hwang
et al. 2001, see Fig. 2). All spectroscopic observations (both
NTT and VLT) were performed using a slit width of 1(cid:48)(cid:48) and the
seeing was generally about 1(cid:48)(cid:48).

2.3. NTT and VLT data reduction

The spatial and spectral images were bias-subtracted and ﬂat-
ﬁelded using standard procedures and utilities from the NOAO
IRAF package. We used the averaged sigma clipping algorithm

avsigclip with the scale parameter set equal to none to combine
the images. Wavelength calibration for the 2D spectral images
were done using arc frames obtained with a He/Ar lamp and pro-
cedure transform. The spectra of the objects were then extracted
from the 2D image using the apall and background tasks. Flux
calibration of the spectra was accomplished by comparison to
the spectrophotometric standard star LTT 3864 (Hamuy et al.
1994) for both the NTT and VLT spectra. Atmospheric extinc-
tion corrections were performed using a spectroscopic extinction
table provided by ESO4.

2.4. HST and Chandra observations

The SNR 0540-69.3 ﬁeld has been imaged with the HST several
times in various bands. In particular, narrow and medium band
ﬁlters are useful to compare with our spectral information. The
HST data highlighted here are described and discussed in Morse
(2003), Morse et al. (2006) and Lundqvist et al. (2011).

To compare the optical and X-ray data we also discuss data
retrieved from the Chandra archive. In Lundqvist et al. (2011)
we discuss these data in greater detail and how they were re-
duced.

(middle) bands with NTT/EMMI, and in the 1.5−6.4 keV X-ray range (right) with Chandra/ACIS (Hwang et al. 2001). The positions of all the
slits used in the spectral observations, and of the detected H II regions are marked as in Fig. 1. A 20(cid:48)(cid:48)×20(cid:48)(cid:48) box marks the inner region of 0540

SNR.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Imaging

Narrow-band [O iii] images of 0540 obtained with NTT/EMMI
through the zero velocity and +6 000 km s−1 ﬁlters ([O iii]/0 and
[O iii]/6000, respectively) are shown in the left and middle panels
of Fig. 2, respectively. The FWHM of the transmission curve for
both ﬁlters corresponds to 3 300 km s−1 (cf. Fig. 3). The +6 000

Article number, page 4 of 30

km s−1 image shows no obvious sign of [O iii] emission in any
part of the remnant, conﬁrming the spectroscopic observations
by Kirshner et al. (1989) who did not ﬁnd any line emission with
redshifts higher than ∼ 3 000 km s−1. The only emission seen
from the remnant in the +6 000 km s−1 image is the continuum
radiation from the PWN powered by the pulsar B0540-69.3 in
SNRC (see Seraﬁmovich et al. 2004; Lundqvist et al. 2011, for
details on the continuum part).

of sight (Sandin et al. 2013), the F673N ﬁlter (cf. Fig. 4) should
encapsulate most of the [S ii] emission.

Figure 4 demonstrates

the diﬀerence between the
HST/WFPC2/F673N (left) and NTT/EMMI/[O iii]/0 (right)
images. The images are presented for the same spatial scale and
the contours of the Chandra/ACIS X-ray image are overlaid
on each optical image to help us to better compare the sizes
and shapes of the SNRC in both images. In the F673N image
the emission from the SNRC in the optical traces the X-ray
emission, and we see no [S ii] emission outside the X-ray PWN
(see also Lundqvist et al. 2011).

One eﬀect not discussed in Morse et al.

(2006) is the in-
ﬂuence of the [O iii] λ4959 line on ﬁlter observations cen-
tered on [O iii] λ5007. Since the velocities of the remnant are
high enough for the λ4959 component to be probed by the
F502N ﬁlter at velocities in the range 1 900 − 4 000 km s−1
(including LMC redshift), and since the expected intensity ra-
tio Iλ5007/Iλ4959 is 3, the eﬀective F502N ﬁlter transmission of
[O iii] λλ4959, 5007 looks like the green curve in Fig. 3. From
this we can clearly see that [O iii] λλ4959, 5007 is not probed
well by F502N for v[O iii] ≤ −1 200 km s−1 and at a redshift
between 1 300 − 1 900 km s−1, bottoming at around 5% eﬀec-
tive transmission at ∼ +1 600 km s−1, while emission from gas
at higher velocities has about 20% eﬀective transmission. If we
compare with the velocity maps of Sandin et al. (2013) for the
VIMOS/IFU ﬁeld, the F502N ﬁlter mainly misses emission from
gas moving away from us at projected positions ∼ 2(cid:48)(cid:48) −3(cid:48)(cid:48) north-
east and northwest of the pulsar, close to the pulsar and ∼ 3(cid:48)(cid:48)
southwest of the pulsar. This is shown in Fig. 6. As we discuss
in Sect. 3.2, there are also regions outside the VIMOS/IFU ﬁeld
that are not probed well by the F502N ﬁlter.

The [O iii]/0 ﬁlter used in our NTT/EMMI observations has
its peak transmission at 5009 Å and has 25% transmission of the
peak value at 5042 Å. Including the emission in [O iii] λ4959,
Fig. 3 shows that 20% eﬀective transmission extends out to
∼ +3500 km s−1 (including LMC redshift), without any dropouts
in transmission like those of the F502N ﬁlter. The 20% transmis-
sion cutoﬀ on the blue side of [O iii] λ5007 is at ∼ −2 200 km s−1.
The [O iii]/0 ﬁlter is therefore likely to probe gas with all likely
velocities, and with less bias than the F502N ﬁlter. Fig. 3 also
shows that the eﬀective transmission is the same (19 %) for
[O iii]/0 and [O iii]/6000 ﬁlters at ∼ 3 600 km s−1, and that the
[O iii]/6000 ﬁlter only kicks in at velocities >∼ 3 000 km s−1,
which is higher than seen in spectra for [O iii].

A diﬀerence image between [O iii]/0 and [O iii]/6000 ﬁlter
observations should therefore remove stars and the synchrotron
continuum from the PWN, and in principle provide a cleaner im-
age than using HST/F502N to probe [O iii]-emitting gas moving
at velocities between ∼ −2 200 km s−1 and ∼ +3 000 km s−1, al-
beit at lower spatial resolution. We show such an image in Fig. 5.
The [O iii]/0 image was smoothed to match the slightly worse
seeing of the [O iii]/6000 image before subtraction. However,
some residuals from the image subtraction remain. The surface
intensity has a square root scaling to bring out faint emission.
To guide the eye, we have included a circle, which corresponds
to the distance freely expanding SN ejecta would reach in 1 100
years if moving at 2 150 km s−1 (or in 1 200 years if moving at
1 980 km s−1) and for a distance to the LMC of 50 kpc (e.g.,
Pietrzy´nski et al. 2019). Although the nebulous [O iii] emission
is complex, there is a hint of emission associated with the SNRC
out to this radius. Fig. 5 also highlights ﬁlaments F1, F2, F4 and
F5.

For the PWN part of the SNRC, the ground-based VI-
MOS/IFU [O iii] images in Sandin et al. (2013), are superior to

Fig. 3. Eﬀective transmission curves for the ESO/[O iii]/0 (red),
ESO[O iii]/6000 (blue) and HST/F502N (green) ﬁlters. The velocity is
centered on the rest velocity of [O iii] λ5007 in the local gas in the LMC,
which we assume has a systemic shift of +273 km s−1 compared to Earth
(cf. Morse et al. 2006). The red wings of the curves ESO/[O iii]/0 and
HST/F502N are due to emission from [O iii] λ4959 that enters the ﬁlter
with a shift of ∼ 2 870 km s−1. We have assumed that this line is a factor
of three weaker than [O iii] λ5007.

The zero-velocity [O iii] image of Fig. 2 reveals more ex-
tended emission in accordance with Caraveo et al. (1992). Faint
patchy nebulosity from the LMC background is also seen. A
comparison between the [O iii]/0 image and the X-ray image
obtained with Chandra/ACIS (right panel of Fig. 2), where the
shell-like structure associated with the outer SNR shock activ-
ity is clearly detected (Hwang et al. 2001), shows no obvious
morphology that connects the optical to the X-ray emission. As
seen in Fig. 4, the slits used for our spectroscopic observations
encapsulate X-ray structures of the SNR. This enables us to test
(see Sect. 3.2) whether or not optical structures projected on the
regions with strong X-ray emission and named “F1", “F2", “F4”
and “F5” in Figs. 1 and 2 belong to, or are aﬀected by the SNR.
The high spatial resolution of HST/WFPC2 allows us to re-
solve in great detail the ﬁlamentary structure of the SNRC. In
Fig. 4 we present an image of this ﬁeld obtained in the narrow
band F673N, centered on [S ii] λλ6716,6731. The F637N data,
and data for the F502N band, centered on [O iii] λ5007, were
shown and discussed by Morse et al. (2006) and Lundqvist et al.
(2011).

Although detailed, the HST [S ii] and [O iii] narrow-band im-
ages may not fully reliably reveal the real structure and size of
the SNRC. The reason is that the narrow band ﬁlters F502N
and F673N may not fully cover the whole line proﬁles of the
[O iii] and [S ii] emission, respectively. As shown in Morse et al.
(2006), the F502N ﬁlter cuts around 5035 Å, which corresponds
to ∼ +1 415 km s−1 from the rest wavelength of [O iii] λ5007 (if
we include a systemic shift of +273 km s−1 for the local gas in
the LMC), but spectroscopic studies show (Kirshner et al. 1989,
Sect. 3.2 of this paper) that the faint [O iii] emission extends up
to at least +1 700 km s−1 (in the rest frame of LMC). This can,
as pointed out by Morse et al. (2006), mean that F502N image
misses out some high-velocity features of the SNRC (see also
below).

The F673N ﬁlter cuts around 6770 Å, which corresponds to
∼ +1 475 km s−1 from the rest wavelength of [S ii] λ6731 (for
the same systemic redshift). Since the [S ii] emitting region is
truly more compact than that emitting [O iii] also along the line

As seen, the [S ii] emission dominating in the HST image does not extend outside the PWN, whereas the [O iii] glow in the NTT image extends far
outside the PWN.

the combination of [O iii]/0 and[O iii]/6000 as it also adds veloc-
ity information, but those images only cover 13(cid:48)(cid:48) × 13(cid:48)(cid:48). A prob-
lem with all the mentioned methods to study the SNRC, even
with the good spectral resolution of the VIMOS/IFU data, is to
clean the images from [O iii], and to a minor extent, He i λ5016
(cf. Fig. 6) emission from H II regions in the LMC.

The [O iii] emission in our NTT image extends outside the X-
ray PWN, and the faint [O iii] glow ﬁlls the space out to ﬁlament
F1. This can certainly not be explained by worse spatial resolu-
tion of the ground-based observations, and further shows that we
are losing some important information in the narrow band HST
ﬁlters. Extended [O iii] emission was discussed in Morse et al.
(2006), and was traced out to a radius of ∼ 8(cid:48)(cid:48). As ﬁlament F1
lies at a projected distance of ≈ 8(cid:48)(cid:48). 5 from the pulsar, the [O iii]
glow is therefore more extended than argued for by Morse et al.
(2006, see also below). As shown in Fig. 5, there is in particular a
broad region of [O iii] glow to the southwest which extends well
outside the ring with a radius of 10(cid:48)(cid:48). We return to this below
whether or not this glow is intrinsic to 0540, or emanates from
other nebulae.

The [O iii] glow in 0540 contrasts the situation for the Crab
nebula, where the ﬁlamentary structure terminates with a shell-
like structure. Observations of the ﬁlamentary ejecta in the Crab
(e.g., Blair et al. 1997; Hester 1998) suggest that the ﬁlaments
are the result of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the interface be-
tween the synchrotron nebula and the swept-up ejecta. The emis-
sion comes from the cooling region behind the shock driven into
the extended remnant by the pressure of the PWN. The same
most likely applies to 0540 (cf. Williams et al. 2008, see also
Section 3.4), but in the Crab there is no external glow (e.g. Tzi-
amtzis et al. 2009), presumably simply because of lack of fast
SN ejecta (Yang & Chevalier 2015). Further comparing with the
Crab, the protruded [O iii] glow in the south-western direction in
0540, bears similarities with the Crab chimney (e.g., Rudie et al.

Article number, page 6 of 30

2008), especially when viewed through the HST/WFPC2/F502N
ﬁlter (see Fig. 6).

3.2. Two-dimensional spectroscopy

As seen from Fig. 1, slits 1 and 2 cross the SNRC in two al-
most orthogonal directions. In both directions the angular sizes
of the SNRC are about ten times larger than the ∼1(cid:48)(cid:48) seeing
value in our NTT and VLT spectral observations. This enables
us to spectrally resolve diﬀerent spatial parts of the SNRC pro-
jected on the slits, i.e., to create space-velocity maps of the en-
capsulated SN ejecta. In these space-velocity maps the contin-
uum emission was subtracted using the IRAF background task
along the spatial axis to reveal the kinematic structure from the
emission lines. We caution that the uneven LMC background in-
troduces some uncertainty in the derived velocity structure, es-
pecially for Hα, at velocities embracing the LMC redshift, i.e.,
at ∼ 270 ± 150 km s−1. In Fig. 6, where we include results for
[O iii] from Sandin et al.
(2013), we have used LMC redshift
as the reference velocity, and will continue to do so as default
throughout the paper, unless otherwise remarked.

The slit (“slit 2") in Fig. 7 (top panel) is oriented almost along
the continuum-emitting elongated structure of the central PWN,
discussed in detail by Lundqvist et al. (2011). In Fig. 7 we have
used a zoomed-in and rotated version of our NTT/EMMI [O iii]
diﬀerence image in the right panel of Fig. 6 for reference, as this
image is free from continuum sources, to show how slit 2 probes
0540.

The second panel from the top in Fig. 7 shows the space-
velocity distribution of the [O iii] λ5007 emitting material encap-
sulated by slit 2. The space-velocity structure of [O iii] λ5007 is
unaﬀected by contamination from [O iii] λ4959 which is shifted
in velocity to [O iii] λ5007 by 2 870 km s−1.

Fig. 5. Right: 65(cid:48)(cid:48) × 33(cid:48)(cid:48) diﬀerence image between NTT/EMMI/[O iii]/0 and NTT/EMMI/[O iii]/6000 with square root intensity scaling to bring
out faint details. The [O iii]/0 image was smoothed to match the slightly worse seeing of the [O iii]/6000 image before subtraction. North is up
and east is to the left. The image can trace faint [O iii] emission to large distances from the pulsar. A blue circle is drawn with radius 10.0(cid:48)(cid:48),
corresponding to ∼ 2 150 km s−1 for ejecta coasting freely for 1 100 years (or ∼ 1 980 km s−1 for 1 200 years) at at distance of 50 kpc. The
ﬁlaments F1, F2, F4 and F5, discussed in the text, are marked. Note PWN protrusions to the north, presumably in the pulsar jet direction, and to
the southwest, which could be a structure similar to the Crab chimney.

The [O iii] emission is dominated by a component with an
average redshift velocity of ∼ 400 km s−1 (relative to LMC
redshift). There is a slight asymmetry with the northeast part be-
ing redshifted with a few hundred km s−1 more than the south-
western part. From the 3D structure of [O iii] outlined by Sandin
(2013), the dominating centra of [O iii] emission in our
et al.
space-velocity map are parts of two separate dominating ring-
like structures in the ejecta. They are clearly displayed in Fig. 6.
To highlight the fainter [O iii] emission, we have constructed
a similar plot to that in Fig. 7, but for wider velocity and spa-
tial ranges. This is shown in Fig. 8 where we have again used
our NTT/EMMI [O iii] diﬀerence image, but this time a rotated
version of that in Fig. 5 to highlight fainter emission. Fig. 8
also includes [O iii] λ4959, which is ≈ 3 times fainter than
[O iii] λ5007, as expected. Both components of the doublet are
shown to more easily evaluate high-velocity features, as well as
the structure of the faint glow outside the SNRC. We have care-
fully subtracted stars, the PWN and LMC H ii regions to trace the
weakest features. Despite this, artifacts due to over-subtraction
of the LMC background emission are seen, but are not crucial to
conclusions about the space-velocity structure of the [O iii] glow.
As seen, the faint glow has a completely diﬀerent structure to
that of the core, as its maximum redshift, close to +2 100 km s−1,
occurs in the southwestern part, whereas the maximum blueshift,
∼ −1 300 km s−1, is in northeastern part. The structures appar-
ent for the two [O iii] line components do not overlap, and have
counterparts in both components that increase the reliability of
the velocity structure. It is evident that the SNRC emission and
the outer [O iii] glow form two distinctly diﬀerent ejecta compo-
nents, which is fully consistent with the ﬁndings of Sandin et al.
(2013) (see also Fig. 6), although the 3D cube of Sandin et al.
(2013) did not include the highest velocities on the receding side.

We also note that the +2 100 km s−1 component has a contin-
uation from ∼ 3 − 4(cid:48)(cid:48) southwest of the pulsar, and further along
the slit in the same direction, all the way out to the edge of the
frame at 9(cid:48)(cid:48) from the pulsar, where the glow has a velocity just
redward of LMC rest velocity, but perhaps also connects to emis-
sion on the blue side. It appears as if the glow is part of an incom-
plete shell structure with stronger emission on the receding side
to the southwest and on the approaching side to the northeast.
This is also consistent with the VIMOS/IFU image in Fig. 6. The
glow continues further to the southwest, but the signal-to-noise
is too low in the NTT/EMMI spectrum to trace the velocity out-
side the frame of Fig. 8. Signal-to-noise was also too low in the
study of Mathewson et al.
(1980) to probe possible broad-line
emission in this direction (at PA = 60◦).

Turning to [S ii] λλ6716,6731 in Fig. 7 we note that it has
a smaller extent to the southwest than [O iii], but similar ex-
tent to the northeast. Although not shown here, we see a simi-
larly small extent in [Ar iii] λ7136. The two line components of
[S ii] blend together which makes the real space-velocity struc-
ture of each component more diﬃcult to disentangle than for
[O iii]. In Sandin et al. (2013) we devised a way to separate the
components, and at the same time create an electron density map
from the relative intensities of the two [S ii] line components, and
we highlight this here in Sect. 3.2.2. The [S ii] lines follow the
trend for [O iii] in Fig. 7, i.e., there is a general redshift towards
the northeast compared to the southwest. The spectral structure
range between a blueshift of ∼ 800 km s−1 and a redshift of
∼ 1 100 km s−1.

The Hα space-velocity structure (second panel from the bot-
tom of Fig. 7) is less organized, mainly due to subtraction of the
uneven LMC background in Hα, but there is also a hint of sub-
traction residuals due to [N ii] λλ6548,6583. The bright emis-

meaning as in Fig.5. The ﬂux scaling is linear. To highlight the [O iii] glow, red contours are inserted for intensities up to 23% of the peak surface
intensity of the PWN. Filament F1 has been marked. North is up and east to the left. Middle two top panels: [O iii] λ5007 as viewed by VIMOS/IFU

of the two panels brings out fainter halo emission. Middle two bottom panels: Same as the two top panels, but in velocity space. A symmetry axis
(also shown in the top panel) is marked that goes through rings of [O iii] emitting ejecta, and a possible jet axis is highlighted for the pulsar jet.
For the lower right panel, likely contamination from LMC H II region He i λ5016 is marked, as is also a region with emission on the approaching
side (≤ −750 km s−1) named the blue “Wall" (also seen for [O iii] λ5007 in Fig. 10). Left: Wavelet ﬁltered HST/WFPC2/F502N map and contours
of a wavelet ﬁltered HST/WFPC2/F457M map (Lundqvist et al. 2011). Areas where the F502N fails to detect [O iii] emission are highlighted. To
guide the eye, a 1(cid:48)(cid:48) slit with PA = 90◦ has been drawn across all top panels. A green line in the rightmost panel marks how far west the VIMOS

sion between 700 − 1 200 km s−1 actually falls on top of the
[N ii] λ6583 line from the LMC. Hα or [N ii] was a serious mat-
(1989). To underline this,
ter of discussion in Kirshner et al.
there is no strong [O iii] or [S ii] emission just north of the pulsar
along the slit reaching out to ∼ +1 900 km s−1), whereas the Hα
plot shows emission there. We agree with Morse et al.
(2006)
that [N ii] λ6583 from 0540 contributes at those wavelengths.
That we expect Hα from 0540 at all mainly rests on the results
from slit 1 which clearly displays several Balmer lines (see be-
low). This was reported for the ﬁrst time in Seraﬁmovich et al.
(2005), and this has led to the interpretation that 0540 stems from
a Type II SN explosion with a zero-age main-sequence mass of
∼ 20 M(cid:12) (Chevalier 2006; Williams et al. 2008; Lundqvist et al.
2011).

Moving to the space-velocity diagrams for slit 1, these are
shown in the images in Fig. 9. We have again used a zoomed-
in and rotated (this time by 2◦) version of our NTT/EMMI
[O iii] diﬀerence image in the right panel of Fig. 6 for reference.
The [O iii] λ5007 VLT/FORS image along slit 1 (Fig. 9) has a
“pepper-slice"-like shape that also reﬂects the expansion of the
SNRC. Like for slit 2, the emission is heavily redshifted, but less
skewed in the space-velocity diagram. The line can be traced be-
tween about −700 km s−1 and +1 400 km s−1. It is easy to imag-
ine a relatively symmetric (but redshifted) shell with ﬁlamentary
structures reaching inward toward the center around the average
velocity of the shell, i.e., ∼ 400 km s−1. However, judging from
the 3D structure derived by Sandin et al. (2013) and shown in

Fig. 6, the eastern and western parts of the “pepper" come from
the same two ring-like features for the SNRC discussed for slit 2
above.

Hβ (panel two from the bottom of Fig. 9) is partly corrupted
by the LMC background subtraction, but can be seen to have a
surprisingly similar structure to that of [O ii] λλ3727,3729 (bot-
tom panel of Fig. 9 in which the velocity scale is centered on
3727.5Å). Both Hβ and the [O ii] lines lack emission at the high-
est velocities ( >∼ 1 200 km s−1) west of the pulsar. The diﬀerent
structures in [O ii] and [O iii] reveal diﬀerent ionization condi-
tions, especially in the western part along the slit. As a matter
of fact, the [S ii] 3D structure of Sandin et al. (2013) resembles
those of Hβ and [O ii] in Fig. 9, which may argue for that the dif-
ferences between the [O iii] and [S ii] are more likely to be due to
an eﬀect of diﬀerent levels of ionization rather than abundance
eﬀects. Moreover, the similarity between Hβ and [O ii] further
argues for contamination of [N ii] in the Hα image in Fig. 7.

Like the NTT data in Fig. 8, the VLT data in Fig. 10 show
a glow of [O iii] λ5007 emission outside the inner part of the
SNRC. The glow extends out to a radius of about 8(cid:48)(cid:48) − 10(cid:48)(cid:48), and
seems to connect to ﬁlament F1 in the west, which in turn ap-
pears to emit at a velocity close to LMC rest velocity. The blue
circle in the upper panel marks a 10(cid:48)(cid:48) radius from the pulsar. The
space-velocity plot in Fig. 10 reveals four interesting features:
fast blueshifted (at least to −1 600 km s−1) faint emission around
the pulsar position, fast redshifted (at least to +1 800 km s−1)
faint emission to the west of the pulsar, no redshifted emission

at ∼ −1 250 km s−1. Contamination by He i λ5016 would intro-
duce emission at ∼ +530 km s−1, and could be responsible for
the “horn" sticking out on the eastern side in the space-velocity
plot, but a similar feature is seen for [O iii] λ4959, so background
subtractions do not leave imprints from He i λ5016 in Fig. 8, con-
trary to the VLT/VIMOS/IFU images of Sandin et al. (2013, cf.
Fig. 6). We highlight that the VLT/VIMOS/IFU images neither
cover F1 nor the low-velocity feature to the east.

The impression from slit 1 is the same as from slit 2, i.e, there
appears to be glow from fast [O iii]-emitting ejecta with a tilt to-

wards red on the western side and towards the blue on the east-
ern side. "Glow" (or at least fast [O iii]-emitting ejecta) can be
seen in the VIMOS/IFU image in Fig. 6 to be more pronounced
for ejecta moving towards us than away from us, and this agrees
with the fast blue-shifted ejecta in Fig. 10 with a projected center
slightly to the east of the pulsar position.

The blue circle drawn in, e.g., Fig. 10 has a radius of 10(cid:48)(cid:48) and
corresponds to a maximum velocity of freely coasting [O iii]-
emitting ejecta with velocity

where DLMC is the distance to 0540 in kpc and tyr is the age of
0540 in years. As the space-velocity spectra do not really reveal
[O iii] at velocities >∼ 2 000 km s−1 (taking the spectral resolution
into account), one may come to the conclusion that there is no
support for space motions of [O iii]-emitting gas much in excess
of 2 000 km s−1 (relative to LMC). However, for both slits 1 and

ordinate (in arcseconds) along the slit, respectively. The horizontal
black lines (for Hα) mark the velocity spread of H II regions in LMC
(∼ ±125 km s−1). The velocity interval aﬀected by the subtraction of
the uneven LMC background is somewhat larger because of the ﬁnite
spectral resolution. Hα is more aﬀected by the background subtraction
than other lines, and blended with [N ii] λλ6548,6583. The vertical line
in the [S ii] image is described in Sect. 3.2.1.

where robs is the projected distance from the pulsar at which the
maximum observed redshift velocity, vobs, of [O iii], emission oc-
curs, and t is the age since explosion. With D = 50 kpc and robs ≈
3.0 × 1018 cm (corresponding to 4(cid:48)(cid:48)), one obtains vtrue([O iii]) ∼
2 090 (2 060) km s−1 for tyr = 1 100 (1 200) and vobs =
1 900 km s−1 for slit 1, and vtrue([O iii]) ∼ 2 270 (2 240) km s−1
for tyr = 1 100 (1 200) and vobs = 2 100 km s−1 for slit 2, respec-
tively. This is several hundred km s−1 faster than vmax([O iii])
for the SNRC on the red side, and also faster than the glow on
the blue side, although confusion with [O iii] λ4959 causes un-
certainty there.

To guide the eye, we have inserted two ellipses in Fig. 10.
Both are for constant vtrue in all azimuthal directions carved out
by the slit, and they are both tuned to give vobs ± 1 900 km s−1
at 4(cid:48)(cid:48) west of the pulsar (as for slit 1). The blue and red curves

set of emission lines, as marked in the panels. The spatial extent of
the images along the slit is 10(cid:48)(cid:48). As for Hα in Fig. 7, the Hβ image is

are for tyr = 1 100 and tyr = 1 200, respectively, and DLMC = 50.
Both curves encapsulate F1, but reach zero velocity at ±9(cid:48)(cid:48). 7 and
±10(cid:48)(cid:48). 4, respectively. If vtrue is indeed the same for the full region
encapsulated by the slit west of the SNRC, Figs. 5 and 10 point
to an age of 1 100 <∼ tyr <∼ 1 200. At the position of F1 (i.e., at
∼ 8(cid:48)(cid:48). 5), the red side of [O iii] λ5007 should reach 800 km s−1
for tyr = 1 100, and 1 200 km s−1 for tyr = 1 200. For a non-
accelerating scenario determining vtrue (as in Eq. 2), the pulsar
seems to be signiﬁcantly younger than the spin-down age, i.e.,
∼ 1600 years. We return to the pulsar age in Section 3.4.3.

Fig. 10. Same as in Fig. 8, but for slit 1. The spatial extent of the images
along the slit is 20(cid:48)(cid:48). Filament F1 is highlighted. Ellipses are drawn
around [O iii] λ5007 marking an ejecta velocity of +1 900 km s−1 at 4(cid:48)(cid:48)
west of the pulsar, assuming freely coasting ejecta and an age of 1 100
years (blue) and 1 200 years (red) for 0540. See text for further details.

Looking at other parts of the space-velocity structure of the
[O iii] λ5007 glow for slit 1, we note that vtrue appears to be sig-
niﬁcantly lower than for the receding region west of the SNRC,
perhaps except for the very eastern part, and towards the center
of the SNRC on the blue side. The absence of [O iii] λ5007 at
high velocities on the red side towards the SNRC is remarkable,
This could be due real diﬀerences in the azimuthal distribution
of [O iii]-emitting gas, but it could in principle also be due dust
absorption screening of the red side behind the SNRC. We ﬁnd
this explanation less likely though, since the dust would have
to be located between the SNRC and fast (unseen due to dust)
ejecta on the blue side, while there is no dust counterpart on the
approaching side. Moreover, one does not see this eﬀect in the
Crab, despite it containing large amounts of dust (Gomez et al.
2012). In the Crab the dust is concentrated to ﬁlaments with
modest ﬁlling factor which in the optical are notably strong in
[O iii].

The picture that emerges for the [O iii] glow seen through
slits 1 and 2 is that it does not come a spherically symmetric shell
surrounding the SNRC, but from a much less complete structure.

Article number, page 11 of 30

A&A proofs: manuscript no. lundqvist_0540

On the blue side it appears to be concentrated to the “wall"-like
structure centered just west of the pulsar position and reaching
out to ∼ −1 600 km s−1 seen and marked as “Blue Wall" in Fig. 6
and shown by Sandin et al. (2013). On the red side, the fastest
glow is in the southwestern and western parts ∼ 4(cid:48)(cid:48) from the pul-
sar reaching space velocities well in excess of 2 000 km s−1. In
the eastern part, velocities covered by slits 1 and 2 are less ex-
treme, especially on the receding side. However, our slits do not
cover the southeastern part. Here we make use of the long-slit
observations by Morse et al. (2006) (described more in Section
3.3.1) as they cover the southeastern and northwestern parts of
the [O iii] glow region. Figure 5a of Morse et al. (2006) shows
a clear asymmetry for the [O iii] glow not covered by our slits
1 and 2, or the VIMOS/IFU data of Sandin et al.
(2013). The
(2006) shows strong [O iii] glow on the
ﬁgure of Morse et al.
approaching side to the northwest, as well to the southeast for
the receding side. Apart from the “wall"-like structure on the
blue side (which is also evident as the blue-ward emission in the
VIMOS/IFU spectrum in. Fig 19), it appears as if the incom-
plete shell of [O iii] glow is devoid of emission on the receding
northern side, and on the approaching southern side.

3.2.1. Density from [S ii] λλ6716,6731

The two components of the [S ii] doublet in Fig. 7 have a dif-
ference in wavelength corresponding to a velocity shift of ≈
640 km s−1. In 0540 they blend together because of the veloc-
ity broadening of the emitting gas. There are, however, a few
positions along the slit for which the blend is small. One such
position is marked with a vertical solid line in Fig. 7, along de-
tector row 29 in our notation. We discussed the deblending of
[S ii] λλ6716,6731 along this row in Seraﬁmovich et al. (2005),
assuming that the line intensity ratio R[S ii] = I(λ6716)
is the
I(λ6731)
same for all parts of the supernova remnant encapsulated by
the slit row. As R[S ii] is density sensitive (e.g., Osterbrock &
Ferland 2006), we eﬀectively assumed that the density is con-
stant in this part of the remnant. The debelendig in Seraﬁmovich
et al. (2005) resulted in R[S ii] = 0.7, and the multilevel model
for [S ii] described in Maran et al.
(2000) was used to obtain
ne = (1.4 − 4.3) × 103 cm−3 for the temperature T = 104 K, and
ne = (1.8 − 5.3) × 103 cm−3 for T = 2 × 104 K.

As we discuss in Sect. 3.4, the temperature in [S ii]-emitting
gas is probably T ∼ 15 000 K. In addition, a more careful back-
ground subtraction along row 29 than the preliminary one in Ser-
aﬁmovich et al. (2005) gives R[S ii] = 0.85±0.10, translating into
ne = (0.9 − 2.0) × 103 cm−3. This is fully consistent with densi-
ties found in the Crab Nebula for which [O ii] and[S ii] line ratios
indicate electron densities in the range 4 × 102 − 4 × 103 cm−3 for
the various ﬁlaments observed (Davidson & Fesen 1985). For the
region mapped out by our detector row 29, Sandin et al. (2013)
estimate ne <∼ 1×103 cm−3. As emphasized by these authors there
are, however, pockets of ejecta with ne ∼ (1 − 2) × 103 cm−3 in
the SNRC when spectra from individual ﬁbers are studied; their
density plot was smoothed over a 2 × 2 pixel kernel. Inspection
of the individual ﬁbre spectra of Sandin et al. (2013) also reveals
background LMC residuals, which introduces a bias to underes-
timate electron densities from [S ii]. The reason is the small ﬁeld
of view of VIMOS which makes background subtraction cum-
bersome. Our estimate of ne ∼ (1 − 2) × 103 cm−3 for detector
row 29 are therefore not in conﬂict with Sandin et al.
(2013).
For a more complete discussion about the variation of electron
density from [S ii] within the SNRC we refer to Sandin et al.
(2013), with the caveat in mind that the electron densities in that

Article number, page 12 of 30

paper coud be somewhat underestimated in general. In addition,
we emphasize that the densities derived for detector row 29 and
in Sandin et al. (2013) are average densities along the line-of-
sight for the SNRC, unlike the situation in the Crab for which
more detailed 3D studies can be done more easily due its prox-
imity (e.g., Charlebois et al. 2010; Martin et al. 2021). In the
analysis in Sect. 3.4 for the SNRC we will use ne = 103 cm−3
unless otherwise speciﬁed.

3.3. One-dimensional spectroscopy

3.3.1. The central part of 0540

Previous optical spectroscopic studies of the SNRC were car-
ried out by Mathewson et al. (1980), Kirshner et al. (1989) and
Morse et al. (2006), and we reported preliminary results of our
NTT/EMMI and VLT/FORS observations in Seraﬁmovich et al.
(2005). We will mainly compare with Kirshner et al. (1989) and
Morse et al. (2006). Kirshner et al. (1989) used a slightly larger
slit (1(cid:48)(cid:48). 5) than us, and positioned their slit to cross the SNRC
at PA = 77◦. Morse et al.
(2006) used an even wider slit (2(cid:48)(cid:48))
at PA= 124◦, and we discussed some of their results already in
Sect. 3.2.

We extracted 1D spectra of the SNRC from our spectral im-
ages using the IRAF procedure apall and spatial extents of 10(cid:48)(cid:48)
and 8(cid:48)(cid:48) centered on the pulsar for slits “1" and “2", respectively.
The extracted windows correspond to the observed extents of the
SNRC along the respective slit directions. The extracted spectra
are shown in Fig. 11 and 12.

Line ﬂuxes were derived by integrating over each line pro-
ﬁle. (No Gausian ﬁtting can be done since the line proﬁles are
strongly non-Gaussian.) This gives accurate ﬂuxes for strong
lines like [O ii] and [O iii] as found from a test where we varied
the background level up and down by 1σ from the mean value;
the statistical error of the strongest lines is less than 5%. For faint
lines like the [Fe ii] lines and Mg i] the ﬂux uncertainty can be up
to 40%. In Table 2 we have marked the ﬂuxes of such lines by a
colon.

A list of identiﬁed lines and their measured ﬂuxes, central
wavelengths and velocities is presented in Table 2. The results
of Kirshner et al.
(2006) are also in-
(1989) and Morse et al.
cluded for comparison. All our ﬂuxes have been dereddened us-
ing E(B − V) = 0.19 and R=3.1, as was also done by Kirshner
et al., while Morse et al. (2006) used E(B − V) = 0.20. A de-
tailed discussion on the extinction towards 0540 can be found
(2004). The ﬂuxes were then normal-
in Seraﬁmovich et al.
ized to [O iii] λ5007. We note that Kirshner et al.
(1989) and
Morse et al. (2006) normalized to the sum of [O iii] λ4959 and
[O iii] λ5007. In Table 2 we therefore simply assumed a 1 : 3
line ratio of those two components, and renormalized all ﬂuxes
in Kirshner et al. (1989) and Morse et al. (2006) to [O iii] λ5007.
Guided by the VIMOS/IFU observations of Sandin et al. (2013),
who concentrated on the two doublets [O iii] λλ4959, 5007 and
[S ii] λλ6716, 6731, one expects line ﬂuxes for the various slit
orientations shown in Table 2 to be diﬀerent just because of dif-
ferent parts of the SNRC being caught by the slits.

Our 1D spectra of the SNRC are consistent with those of the
other studies but also reveal many diﬀerences. The higher sensi-
tivity of the VLT observations allowed us in Seraﬁmovich et al.
(2005) to report many new lines not detected in previous studies,
and we report more here. The most important ﬁndings in Ser-
(2005) were [Ne iii] λλ3869,3967 and Balmer
aﬁmovich et al.
lines of hydrogen all the way down to H i λ3889 (Hζ). While the
neon lines constrain the supernova, the Balmer lines show that

highlight weaker lines. The spectrum has been dereddened using E(B − V) = 0.19 and R=3.1. “Hα" is a blend of Hα and [N ii] λλ6548,6583.

the previously detected emission around Hα is at least partly due
to Hα, and not only to [N ii] λ6583, or any other line as dis-
cussed by Caraveo et al. (1998). We do not try to separate Hα
from [N ii] λλ6548,6583. However, from the Hα panel of Fig. 7
it is clear that [N ii] is present with a velocity structure that looks
similar to that of [S ii], and with a velocity for [N ii] λ6583 that
reaches at least +1 000 km s−1 in the LMC rest frame. Morse
et al. (2006) estimated an intensity ratio of IHα/I[N ii] ∼ 1.1 for
their slit position.

The [Ne iii] λλ3869,3967 lines, and [O iii] λ4363 are all
contaminated by H i lines, which leads to an overestimate of
the ﬂuxes of these lines not accounted for in Table 2, and for
[O iii] λ4363 ﬂuxes in previous investigations. Another compli-
cation is that all H i lines suﬀer from inﬂuence of the uneven
LMC background which must be compensated for. We discuss
this further Sect. 3.4.

Using unblended lines we estimate that the mean velocity of
the central region of the 0540 system is +500±55 km s−1 for
slit “1" and +380±60 km s−1 for slit “2", respectively, when the
LMC redshift of 270 km s−1 is accounted for. Within errors both
values are consistent with each other, and a mean velocity of the
two gives +440±80 km s−1. This is ∼ 100 km s−1 higher than
the value of Kirshner et al. (1989), but the two investigations are
consistent with each other, despite diﬀerent slit orientations.

The redshift of the SNRC of 0540 is indeed large. An expla-
nation could be that the 0540 system is the result of an asymmet-
(2004). The
ric explosion, as discussed by Seraﬁmovich et al.

SNRC of 0540 is not unique in that sense. Balick & Heckman
(1978) found that the oxygen-rich SNR NGC 4449 also moves
at a velocity of ∼ 500 km s−1 relative to its surrounding H II re-
gions. Like 0540, this remnant is also oxygen-rich. Over a larger
scale, 0540 may not be all that asymmetric as revealed by the
[O iii] glow from ejecta moving at high speed ( >∼ 1 500 km s−1)
both towards and away from us discussed in Sect. 3.2. (see also
Morse et al. 2006; Sandin et al. 2013).

3.3.2. Filaments

SNR 0540-69.3 is near the LMC H II region DEM 269 and the
OB association LH 104 (see Kirshner et al. 1989, and references
therein, as well as below.) This is consistent with that we detect
narrow emission lines that vary spatially in strength along our
slits. The lines are spectrally unresolved (except for one case,
see below).

To study whether or not some of these emitting regions are
aﬀected by the SNR activity, we looked at ﬁlaments detected
along the slits. We mainly considered those with an [O iii] tem-
perature in clear excess of 104 K, as is usually observed in shocks
or photoionization heated regions of known SNRs. We assumed
the same extinction for the ﬁlaments as for the remnant, and used
the standard ratio R[O iii] = I(λ4959)+I(λ5007)
for the temperature
(e.g., Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). We also looked for lines of
highly ionized ions as tracers of inﬂuence by the SNR. We de-

spectrum has been dereddened using E(B − V) = 0.19 and R=3.1. Note the signiﬁcantly higher signal-to-noise in the VLT spectrum compared to
Fig. 11, which made it possible to detect new lines in SNR 0540-69.3 as reported in Seraﬁmovich et al. (2005) and here. Of particular importance
are the [Ne iii] lines and Hβ (see text).

tected a few ﬁlaments of interest along the VLT slits “1" and “3",
and they are marked as F1, F2, F4 and F5 in Fig. 1. We also mark
ﬁlament F3, and use this as reference for a presumed LMC H II
region.

The typical size of the ﬁlaments along the slit is ∼ 3(cid:48)(cid:48). As in
the case of the SNRC we have constructed 1D spectra for each
ﬁlament. The dereddened spectra of F1, which is closest to the
SNRC in projection, and F5, which appears close to the outer
shock front detected in X-rays, are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, re-
spectively. Spectra of the other ﬁlaments are similar to the ones
presented. Lists of identiﬁed spectral lines for F1-F5 with mea-
sured ﬂuxes, central wavelengths and velocities, are presented in
Tables 3 and 4. We return to a more detailed discussion of the
ﬁlaments in Sect. 3.4.2.

3.4. Line proﬁles and intensities

3.4.1. The central part

Supernova remnants are good laboratories to test the theory of
stellar evolution, explosive nucleosynthesis, radiation processes
and shock physics. To test the ﬁrst two items, an estimate of ele-
mental abundances of the ejecta is essential. As the information
from SNRs mainly rests on collisionally excited lines, we there-
fore also require knowledge about the density and temperature
of the emitting gas.

Article number, page 14 of 30

The observed strength of the spectral lines allow us to de-
duce this information. The prime thermometer is R[O iii]. Because
we see [O iii] λλ4959, 5007 and [O iii] λ4363 in all VLT spectra
of 0540 and the ﬁlaments, we are able to estimate the tempera-
ture of the [O iii] emitting plasma in both the SN ejecta and the
ﬁlaments.

for

Unfortunately,

the SNRC with its broade lines,
[O iii] λ4363 is blended with Hγ. This may lead to over-
estimating the [O iii] temperature. To get the real [O iii] tem-
perature we subtracted Hγ from the line proﬁle of the observed
[O iii] λ4363+Hγ blend. As a template proﬁle for all H i lines
we used Hβ. As shown in Fig. 15, the Hβ template is aﬀected by
[Fe iii] λ4481, but this has very small impact on the process of re-
moving the bluer Balmer lines. A further complication is that all
hydrogen lines suﬀer from background contamination of emis-
sion around LMC rest velocity. We approximated this for all H i
lines by a linear approximation of the ﬂux across the corrupted
frequency range.

The expected ﬂux of Hγ relative to Hβ was estimated
from Case B theory (Brocklehurst 1971). The bottom panel
of Fig. 15 shows how we were able to remove Hγ from the
[O iii] λ4363+Hγ blend. As a spin-oﬀ, the line subtraction con-
ﬁrms the values we used for the dereddening, i.e., E(B − V) =
0.19 and R = 3.1; when the Balmer line was removed, contin-
uum level was attained.

After the Hγ subtraction, the ﬂux of [O iii] λ4363 relative
to [O iii] λ5007 (set to 100) is ∼ 4.3 (instead of 5.7, if Hγ

in Figs. 11 and 12, we have also plotted the spectra with expanded ﬂux scales to highlight weaker lines. The spectrum was dereddened using
E(B − V) = 0.19 and R=3.1. Note the broad base of the [O iii] λλ4959,5007 lines skewed to the red as compared to the narrow components,
reaching at least +1 700 km s−1. No such features are seen in spectra of the emission from ﬁlaments F2, F3, F4 or F5 (see Fig. 14) as marked in
Fig. 1. Line ﬂuxes of all ﬁlaments are given in Tables 3 and 4.

is unaccounted for). This gives R[O iii] ∼ 31. We can, how-
ever, reﬁne this analysis by comparing the deblended proﬁle of
[O iii] λ4363 to that of a template proﬁle for [O iii] λλ4959,5007.
The template for the latter was made from a similar procedure
(2013), i.e., the blue part
to what was done in Sandin et al.
of [O iii] λ4959 and the red part of [O iii] λ5007 were used as
initial guesses for the template. With the known intensity ra-
tio of 3 for I(λ5007)/I(λ4959), we constructed the combined
[O iii] λλ4959,5007 template shown in red in Fig. 16. The tem-
plate is for the sum of the two line components. In the same
ﬁgure we have also included the “clean" [O iii] λ4363 proﬁle
from Fig. 15. Once multiplied by a factor of 28, and once by
34. In general, the [O iii] λ4363 proﬁle is similar to that of the
[O iii] λλ4959,5007 template, although noise limits the useful-
ness of the [O iii] λ4363 proﬁle in its wings.

We thus ﬁnd R[O iii] = 31 ± 3, with a tendency for a lower
ratio in the blue part of the line proﬁle compared to the red.
The corresponding [O iii] temperature range for the SNRC is
23 500 ± 1 800 K (cf. Table 5). This is less than ∼ 34 000 K, but
consistent with ≈ 25 500 K estimated by Kirshner et al. (1989)
and Morse et al.
(2006), resepctively. In neither of those two
studies Hγ was accounted for. The slightly larger ratio we ﬁnd
for R[O iii] for the receding side of the remnant (compared to LMC
rest velocity) could be due to a lower temperature in this part of
the SNRC, or intrinsic dust reddening. The latter would not be

surprising considering that dust in the Crab nebula is concen-
trated to [O iii]-emitting ﬁlaments, and the pathlength through
dust to the receding side of the SNRC is likely to be longer than
to ejecta moving toward us. To compensate for the factor ∼ 1.2
in larger R[O iii]-value for the red side, E(B − V) would have to be
∼ 0.5 instead of 0.19. This would depress the red side of the line
proﬁles severely, which is not what we see. Dust is therefore not
a likely reason for the large R[O iii]-value on the red side of the
[O iii] lines.

Fig. 16 shows that the blue sides of [O iii] λ4959 and
[O iii] λ5007 nearly reach −1 900 km s−1, which was diﬃcult
to disentangle from Fig. 10 due to blending. For the red side, the
maximum velocity is +1 700 km s−1, which is consistent with
the space- velocity results. Fig. 17 shows that the construction
of the [O iii] λλ4959,5007 template reveals a residual that we at-
tribute to [Fe iii] λ4986, a line that is also seen in the spectra of
the ﬁlaments and other SNRs (Fesen & Hurford 1996).

The [Ne iii] λλ3869,3967 doublet is also aﬀected by blending
with Balmer lines. The same subtraction routine was applied for
both components of [Ne iii], and in Fig. 15 we show how the
Balmer lines Hζ and H(cid:15) were removed from their blends with
[Ne iii] λ3869 and [Ne iii] λ3968, respectively. As seen from the
ﬁgure, [Ne iii] λ3869 is insigniﬁcantly contaminated by Balmer
line emission, whereas [Ne iii] λ3967 is more aﬀected.

Fig. 14. Spectrum of an H II region along the VLT slit “3” at a projected distance of 25(cid:48)(cid:48) to the west of the pulsar (called ﬁlament F5 in Figs. 1
and 2). As in Fig. 11, we have also plotted spectra with expanded ﬂux scales to highlight weaker lines. The spectrum have been dereddened using
E(B − V) = 0.19 and R=3.1.

A direct comparison between [Ne iii] λ3869 and [O iii] λ5007
is shown in Fig. 18. The proﬁle of the neon line is fairly
noisy, but it is consistent with the general features and maxi-
mum velocities of [O iii] λ5007. The ratio of the two lines is
I[O iii] λ5007/I[Ne iii] λ3869 ∼ 30. With a temperature in the 23 500 ±
1 800 K, and assuming similar ionization structures of O2+ and
Ne2+, our multilevel atom models (e.g., Maran et al. 2000; Mat-
tila et al. 2010), updated with the recent atomic data in the CHI-
ANTI database (Del Zanna et al. 2021), result in a mass ratio
MNe/MO ∼ 0.07, which should probably be considered a lower
limit since the ionization zone of O2+ is likely to be wider than
that of Ne2+. In this context, we highlight the observations of
Morse et al. (2006). They detected [Ne iii] λ3869, but neither got
a 3σ detection of [Ne iii] λ3967, nor corrected for Balmer line
contamination. Their ﬂux values translate into MNe/MO ∼ 0.13
for the temperature we ﬁnd from [O iii].

Williams et al. (2008) modeled the emission from 0540, and
in those models they assumed the abundance ratio Ne/O = 0.2
(i.e., a mass ratio of 0.25), and obtained I[Ne iii] λ3869/I[O iii] λ5007 =
0.093. This is almost three times the value we obtain from our
observations; if the MNe/MO ratio in their model is lowered to
0.085 (i.e., close to our value of 0.07), their predicted line ratio
should agree with our observations. The question is how likely a
value of MNe/MO ∼ 0.1 could be. It is, for example, about half
the mass ratio for the inner ejecta found in a recent model for
the nucleosynthesis yields for the central part of an exploding
11.8 M(cid:12) star (Sieverding et al. 2020), but the models of Chieﬃ
& Limongi (2013), which take rotation of the progenitor into ac-

count, yield MNe/MO = 0.063 (0.053) (0.21) M(cid:12) for progenitor
masses of 13 (15) (20) M(cid:12). For non-rotating progenitors Chieﬃ
& Limongi (2013) ﬁnd MNe/MO = 0.22 (0.46) (0.32) M(cid:12). Judg-
ing from this, rotation could be important as MNe/MO in those
models agree with the values derived from observations.

In the models of Williams et al.

(2008), infrared lines ob-
served with Spitzer Space Telescope were included. To compare
the IR lines to optical lines, these authors multiplied the ﬂuxes in
Morse et al. (2006) by a factor of 4 to account for the 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slit in
the optical as the infrared observations observed the full region.
We use the same procedure, but to put the slit compensation on
ﬁrmer footing, we make use of the VLT/VIMOS observations
of Sandin et al.
(2013). In Fig. 19 we show the line proﬁle of
[O iii] λ5007 for the full 13(cid:48)(cid:48) × 13(cid:48)(cid:48) ﬁeld observed with VIMOS,
and compare this to 7.2× the template [O iii] λ5007 proﬁle from
our slit 1 observations. With the 7.2 factor, the integrated emis-
sion of the two proﬁles is the same for velocities >∼ −750 km s−1.
About 10% of the VIMOS [O iii] λ5007 ﬂux falls at velocities
below −750 km s−1, and is mainly attributed to [O iii] glow not
captured eﬃciently by the slits used by Morse et al. (2006) and
us. We therefore use the factor of 7.2 for most lines For lines
with suspected glow we use 8.0 since the Spitzer ﬁeld-of-view is
likely to capture much of the glow. (The corresponding numbers
for our NTT/EMMI slit, i.e., slit 2, is 6.3 and 6.6, respectively.)
As Morse et al. (2006) obtain ≈ 1.6 times larger [O iii] λ5007
ﬂux through their 2(cid:48)(cid:48) × 11(cid:48)(cid:48) slit than we do through our 1(cid:48)(cid:48) × 10(cid:48)(cid:48)
slit, the conversion factor Williams et al.
(2008) should have
used for most lines is 4.5, instead of their 4. For [O iii] λ5007, and

line components. The [O iii] λ4363 is the blue-red proﬁle in the bottom

of relatively weaker [O iii] λ4363 on the blue side, which could mean
hotter [O iii]-emitting plasma on the receding side of 0540 (see text).

The diﬀerence (red) is attributed to [Fe iii] λ4986. The maximum veloc-
ity on the red side of [O iii] λ5007 is ≈ +1 800 km s−1, which may be
less than on the blue side (≈ −1 900 km s−1, see Fig. 16).

which is twice as high as in the model of Williams et al.
(2008). From our multilevel modeling it is obvious that the
[Ne iii] 15.6µ ﬂux cannot come from the same hot gas as the
[O iii] lines we observe, since the ratio for this at 23 000 K is
I[Ne iii] 15.6µ/I[Ne iii] λ3869 ∼ 0.14. An intensity ratio of 6.7 is only
obtained for temperatures <∼ 7 000 K. Although there are several
uncertainties, the main explanation must be that [Ne iii] 15.6µ
predominantly comes from regions with much lower tempera-
tures than that emitting the optical [O iii] and [Ne iii] lines. The
most likely region is gas heated by photionization rather than
by shocks, as shock-heated material would be hotter. Extinction

(blue) together with the “cleaned" [Ne iii] λ3869 proﬁle in Fig. 15. The
[Ne iii] proﬁle was multiplied by a factor of 30 to match [O iii] λ5007.
Note the similar widths and structures of the two proﬁles. Noise is too
high for the [Ne iii] line to trace it out the highest velocities on the blue
side.

the [O ii] lines is centered on 3727.5 Å. The [O ii] proﬁle was multiplied
by a factor of 2 to match 1.33× [O iii] λ5007. Note that [O ii] λ3726
only reaches ≈ −1 400 km s−1 on the blue side (when the 118 km s−1
diﬀerence between [O ii] λ3726 and 3727.5 Å is accounted for). On the
red side of [O ii] λ3729 the emission is blended with [Fe vii] λ3759 as
shown by the inset. The red curve is Savitzky-Golay ﬁtting to the noisy
[Fe vii] line proﬁle.

observed by Sandin et al. (2013). The slit 1 proﬁle was multiplied by a
factor of 7.2 to match the integrated emission at ≥ −750 km s−1. Note
the strong [O iii] emission for ≤ −750 km s−1 for the larger ﬁeld-of-view
compared to the slit 1 observations. This emission corresponds to about
10% of the total [O iii] emission. A minor fraction (∼ 10%) of the emis-
sion at ≤ −750 km s−1 could be due to [Fe iii] λ4986, as displayed in
Fig. 17, but most of it comes from the approaching “wall" described in
Sect. 3.2.

Fig. 21. Same in Fig. 18, but for [S ii] λλ4069,4076 (black, and
smoothed in red) instead of [Ne iii] λ3869. The [O iiii] proﬁle was mul-
tiplied by a factor of 0.03 to match [S ii]. The sulphur doublet was
velocity-centered on the λ4069 component. LMC rest frame velocities
for both components are marked by vertical thin lines. The red side
of the [S ii] doublet is aﬀected by Hδ. (The dip in Hδ is due to over-
subtraction of the LMC background.)

due to internal dust may be a complementary explanation as this
would not aﬀect the IR line.

Fig. 19 emphasizes the redshift of all [O iii] emission from
the full SNRC, and shows that the line proﬁle through slit
1 surprisingly well represents the emission at most velocities.
The most obvious diﬀerence is the strong emission at velocities
<∼ − 750 km s−1 (which is also evident from Fig. 6, and which
is mainly due to the approaching “wall" described in Sect. 3.2)
as well as slightly more emission at >∼ + 750 km s−1. The peak
around LMC rest velocity is at least to some extent artiﬁcial due
to diﬃculty with removing LMC background emission due to the

small ﬁeld-of-view of VIMOS. The VIMOS data are not sensi-
tive enough to trace velocities >∼ | ±1 500 | km s−1.

Turning to ions of lower degree of ionization observed
through slit 1, we show [O ii] λλ3726,3729 in Fig. 20,
[S ii] λλ4069,4076 in Fig. 21, and He i λ5876 in Fig. 22. For
[O ii] and [S ii] we have centered the velocity on 3727.5 Å and
the strongest component of [S ii] (i.e., λ4069), respectively. As
already discussed in Sect. 3.2, [O ii] has a proﬁle similar to that
of Hβ, and [S ii] λλ4069,4076 is similarly narrow, i.e., primarily
extends from ∼ −700 km s−1 to ∼ +1 000 km s−1, although there
is a blue wing of [O ii] that reaches ∼ −1 400 km s−1. This is not

O+ to emit [O ii] λλ7319-7331 at the observed relative inten-
sity. In particular, for the [O iii] temperature T ∼ 23 000 K,
I[S ii] λλ6716,6731/I[O ii] λλ7319−7331 ∼ 7 for S/O = 0.1 and elec-
tron densities estimated by Sandin et al. (2013). The ratio rises
steeply below 20 000 K.

Another way to estimate a temperature in the [O ii]-emitting
regions is from the ratio I[O ii] λλ3726,3729/I[O ii] λλ7319−7331, but for
this we have to combine slits 1 and 2. Using the slit correction
factors 7.2 and 6.3, respectively, we obtain ∼ 6.2, which is very
close to ∼ 6.5 by Kirshner et al. (1989), but very diﬀerent from
the modeled ﬂux by Williams et al. (2008), which is ≈ 14.7. Our
multilevel model suggests very high temperatures (well above
30 000 K) to get a ratio below 8.0, which appears unlikely. Since
our ﬂux agrees with that of Kirshner et al. (1989), a possible ex-
planation could be that [O ii] λλ7319-7331 is contaminated by
[Ca ii] in both our slit 2 and the data in Williams et al. (2008).
Such contamination (at 20% level) was already discussed by Kir-
shner et al. (1989).

(2006) and Williams et al.

A combination of slits 1 and 2 can also be used to estimate
an [S ii]- temperature from I[S ii] λλ6716,6731/I[S ii] λλ4069,4076, which
with our slit compensations is ∼ 30. This is much higher than
∼ 17 by Kirshner et al.
(1989), and inconsistent with ∼ 9.4
by Morse et al. (2006) as well as the model by Williams et al.
(2008) which predicts ∼ 7.4. Our multilevel models show some
density dependence, but intensity ratios such as those by Morse
et al.
(2008) require temperatures
at least as high as our derived [O iii] temperature from slit 1,
whereas our ratio and that of Kirshner et al.
(1989) indicate
temperatures of well below 10 000 K and around 15 000 K, re-
spectively. Comparing observations through diﬀerent slits, and
at diﬀerent epochs, admittedly increases the risk of systematic
errors, so to make a consistency check we have used the full
SNRC [S ii] spectra of Sandin et al.
(2013) to make artiﬁcial
observations of [S ii] through slits 1 and 2. From this exercise
we ﬁnd that the slit compensation for [S ii] λλ6716,6731 is 6.5
for slit 1 and 7.7 for slit 2 (instead of the values 7.2 and 6.3,
as indicated by [O iii]). This is not large enough to change our
I[S ii] λλ6716,6731/I[S ii] λλ4069,4076 ratio by much (and actually makes
it even larger).

lie in the large
relative [S ii] λλ6716,6731 ﬂux we get for slit 2 compared
to others (cf. Table 2), and/or the lower ﬂux we measure
for [S ii] λλ4069,4076. The latter is not unreasonable since
[S ii] λλ4069,4076 is aﬀected by Hδ. From Brocklehurst
(1971) we estimate that Hδ would amount to ∼ 25% of Hβ,
which would decrease the I[S ii] λλ6716,6731/I[S ii] λλ4069,4076 ratio
accordingly, if not corrected for. This eﬀect, of course, does not
aﬀect the modeled results of Williams et al. (2008). Regarding
[S ii] λλ6716,6731 we can do a direct test against the VIMOS
observations of Sandin et al. (2013) by placing artiﬁcial slits on
the VIMOS images to simulate slits 1 and 2. From ﬁgure 3 of
Sandin et al. (2013) it can be seen that I[S ii] λλ6716,6731/I[O iii] λ5007
is never higher than ∼ 0.8, and for slits 1 and 2 we get ∼ 0.47 and
∼ 0.35, respectively. Even if we allow for slight displacement of
slit 2 due to atmospheric dispersion (which was not accounted
for in the NTT/EMMI observations), the ratio will not increase
by more than ∼ 20%. Careful check of possible erroneous
background subtraction of [S ii] λλ6716,6731, together with the
fact that the ﬂux of other lines through slit 2 agrees with the
results of Kirshner et al. (1989) and Morse et al. (2006), leaves
us no choice other than to suggest that the [S ii] λλ6716,6731
ﬂux could vary with time. If we use a ratio of 0.35 from a
simulated slit 2, we obtain I[S ii] λλ6716,6731/I[S ii] λλ4069,4076 ∼ 12,

seen for [S ii] λλ4069,4076 in Fig. 21, but the low signal-to-noise
does not allow us to draw ﬁrm conclusions on that part of the line
proﬁle. Interestingly enough, the full view SNRC observations
of [S ii] λλ6716,6731 by Sandin et al. (2013, their Figure 2) does
show a blue wing between −1 200 km s−1 and −700 km s−1. Our
choice to center the [O ii] doublet on 3727.5 Å is because this
does not introduce any bias for either of the two doublet compo-
nents. What is intrinsically assumed by centering on 3727.5 Å is
that we assume that I[O ii] λ3729/I[O ii] λ3726 ≈ 1.11, which means
ne ∼ 350 (400) cm−3 for T ∼ 20 000 (30 000) K. According to
our multilevel model, the intensity ratio decreases from ≈ 1.35 to
≈ 0.38 as electron density increases from 102 cm−3 to 104 cm−3.
Our observed I[S ii] λλ4069,4076/I[O ii] λλ3726,3729 ratio is ∼ 0.06.
For the temperature interval 10 000 − 15 000 K and density inter-
val 500 − 1 000 cm−3, our multilevel model atoms translate the
observed ratio into an abundance ratio of S/O= 0.05 ± 0.01, and
thus a mass ratio MS/MO = 0.10 ± 0.02. The models of Chieﬃ
& Limongi (2013) predict a ratio of 0.05 − 0.06 for rotating pro-
genitors for progenitor masses between 13−20 M(cid:12), and between
0.05 − 0.13 for non-rotating (with 0.05 for 20 M(cid:12)). The more re-
cent model of Sieverding et al. (2020) predicts MS/MO = 0.085
from their 11.8 M(cid:12) model for the inner ejecta and 0.12 M(cid:12) for

their models, and underproduced [S iii] 18µ and [S iv] 10µ by
factors of ∼ 1.4 and ∼ 2.8, respectively, when we adjust their
results with more accurate slit compensations. It therefore ap-
pears as if their model would ﬁt the Spitzer data better with
MS/MO ∼ 0.1, which is consistent with both Chieﬃ & Limongi
(2013) and Sieverding et al. (2020), albeit perhaps not for non-
rotating low-mass progenitors in the case of Chieﬃ & Limongi
(2013). However, the model of Williams et al. (2008) gives an
I[S ii] λλ4069,4076/I[O ii] λλ3726,3729 ratio which is ∼ 0.09, and that
is on the high side compared to our observations already with
MS/MO = 0.05.

MS/MO can also be estimated from our slit 2 data for which
we have I[S ii] λλ6716,6731/I[O ii] λλ7319−7331 ∼ 9.0. This is similar to
≈ 8.4 by Kirshner et al. (1989), and 10 in the model of Williams
(2008) assuming S/O = 0.1). Our multilevel atom mod-

In each panel grey arrows mark velocities for other nebular lines seen in SNRs (Fesen & Hurford 1996). In particular, [Fe ii] λ5159 could be
blended with (and even dominated by) [Fe vii] λ5159. Note the broad wings of [Fe v] λ4227, possibly reaching ±2 000 km s−1.

which is more aligned with what other groups get, and would
suggest an [S ii] temperature of ∼ 20 000 K. The question
remains regarding our high [S ii] λλ6716,6731 ﬂux. We note
that there are NTTT/EMMI spectra covering [S ii] λλ6716,6731
from 1995 January, i.e., only one year before our NTT spectrum,
which were shown in Caraveo et al. (1998). Unfortunately, these
authors did not provide any ﬂuxes. As there is activity going on
in the south-western part of the PWN, at least between 1999-
2007, the NTT spectra of Caraveo et al.
(1998) could prove
decisive regarding temporal variations in [S ii] λλ6716,6731.
As discussed in Sect. 3.4.2, variations of elements other than
oxygen on relative short time scale are conceivable.

Figure 22 shows that He i λ5876 is very concentrated to
within ±500 km s−1, in a fairly similar fashion to Hβ and [S ii].
This means that hydrogen was deeply mixed into the core region
during the explosion. Such mixing is expected from 3D explo-
sion models (e.g., Hammer et al. 2010), and the amount of hy-
drogen mixed into the SNRC is sensitive to hydrodynamic insta-
bilities at the composition interfaces (e.g., Wongwathanarat et al.
2015). A crude He/H ratio for the SNRC can be estimated from
recombination theory, assuming similar ionization zones for H
and He. The observed ﬂux ratio of He i λ5876 to Hβ for our slit
1 is ∼ 0.24, with at least 40% uncertainty. For a temperature in
the range 10 000 − 20 000 K this translates into a mass ratio of
He+/H+ which is ∼ 0.8. As He0 roughly has the same ionization
potential as S+, and [S ii] emission dominates over [S iii] in 0540
(Kirshner et al. 1989), a larger fraction of helium is likely to be
neutral than that of hydrogen, and MHe/MH is likely to be larger

Article number, page 20 of 30

than 0.8 for the SNRC of 0540. The fraction of fully ionized
helium could in principle be tested with He ii λ4686, but it sits
in a spectral range with strong [Fe iii] lines, and is not detected.
SN 1987A may serve as interesting comparison for MHe/MH,
and we note that Jerkstrand et al.
(2011) estimate that both H
and He have ∼ 1.2 M(cid:12) each in the central 2000 km s−1 region of
SN 1987A, i.e., the mass ratio is MHe/MH ≈ 1, which is consis-
tent with what we estimate for the SNRC of 0540.

Through slit 2 we also detect [Ar iii] λ7136 and [Ni ii] λ7378
with intensities relative to [O iii] λ5007 similar to what was re-
ported by Kirshner et al. (1989) (cf. Table 2). On the other hand,
the modeled [Ar iii] λ7136 ﬂux by Williams et al.
(2008) was
more than twice as high as the observed relative ﬂuxes of the
line. This could suggest that Ar/O is less than the value of 0.1
assumed by Williams et al. (2008). Tuning the model results of
(2008) with the observed [Ar iii] λ7136 ﬂuxes
Williams et al.
then suggest MAr/MO ∼ 0.02. The nucleosynthesis yields in
the model of Sieverding et al. (2020) give the same value, i.e.,
MAr/MO ∼ 0.02 for the total yield of Ar and O. The ratios in
Chieﬃ & Limongi (2013) are ∼ 0.01 for 13 − 20 M(cid:12) rotat-
ing, and 20 M(cid:12) for non-rotating progenitors, whereas the ratio
is higher, ∼ 0.02, for 13 M(cid:12) non-rotating progenitors. Our mul-
tilevel model atoms suggest MAr/MO = 0.015(0.030) for equal
ionization zones of Ar2+ and O2+ in the SNRC and for tempera-
tures of 20 000 (30 000) K. The observed level of [Ar iii] λ7136
is therefore consistent with that expected from elemental yields
in progenitor models and with [O iii] temperatures.

5007 Å and 3727.5 Å, i.e., ∼ 355 km s−1 and ∼ 476 km s−1, respectively. Note the broad bases seen for [O iii] and possible broad base wings for
[O ii] λλ3726,3729. Lines of the H i Balmer series are marked in the middle panel. For the iron lines, Gaussians have also been drawn (in blue)

[Fe iii] λ5270,

[Fe ii] λλ4287,4414,5044,

As shown in Fig. 17 ([Fe iii] λ4986), Fig. 20 ([Fe v] λ3726)
and Fig. 23 ([Fe ii] λ5159,
[Fe v] λ4227
and [Fe vii] λ5721) we detect several forbidden iron lines
through slit 1, with decent signal-to-noise. We also de-
[Fe iii] λ4658,4881,4986,
tect
[Fe v] λλ3783-3797 and [Fe vii] λ5721. The strongest line is
[Fe iii] λ4658, but it blends with several other [Fe iii] lines, as
do also several [Fe ii] lines around ∼ 4474 Å. Through slit 2
we detect [Fe ii] λ5159 and [Fe iii] λλ4658,5270, but with poor
signal-to-noise.

We have chosen to concentrate on presumably unblended
lines observed through slit1. In general, the line proﬁles are
similar to those of the [O ii] lines. In particular this is the
case for [Fe iii] λ5270 and the core of [Fe v] λ4227, whereas
[Fe vii] λ5721 is noisy, and perhaps also aﬀected by [N ii] λ5755
in the far red wing. In Fig. 23 we have marked the velocities
corresponding to other lines detected in SNRs (Fesen & Hur-
ford 1996) which could perhaps contribute to the lines we have
highlighted. For example, [Fe ii] λ4247 could contribute to the
red wing of [Fe v] λ4227, and our identiﬁcation of [Fe ii] λ5159
could instead be dominated by [Fe vii] λ5159, in particular since
we also detect [Fe vii] λ5721. To test this we have used our nine-
level model atom for Fe6+, including data from Berrington et al.
(2000) and Del Zanna et al.
(2021, and references therein).
For ne = 103 cm−3 and T = 30 000 K, the expected strongest
[Fe vii] lines are (in order and normalized to [Fe vii] λ5721):
[Fe vii] λ6089, [Fe vii] λ3759, [Fe vii] λ3587, [Fe vii] λ4990 and
[Fe vii] λ5159 with relative strengths 1.9, 1.4, 1.0, 0.7 and 0.5,
respectively. Unfortunately, [Fe vii] λ3587 and [Fe vii] λ6089 are
outside the spectral range of our slit 1 observations, although

the latter line can, after smoothing, be hinted in the NTT/EMMI
spectrum. [Fe vii] λ3759 is clearly detected through slit 1, and
[Fe vii] λ4990 may add to [Fe iii] λ4986 in Fig. 17. Judging from
the weak measured ﬂux of [Fe vii] λ5721, and that [Fe vii] λ5159
is not expected to be stronger, we conclude that the spectral line
at ∼ 5171 Å (and ∼ 5160 Å through slit 2) is dominated by
[Fe ii] λ5159. The line has a possible broad blue wing, which is
also hinted for [Fe v] λ4227 (cf. Fig. 23). However, since no such
wing is expected for [Fe ii] lines, it is probably not real. Deeper
observations are needed to check the wing of the [Fe v] line.

3.4.2. Masses and abundances - a summary

In the previous section we estimated the relative abundances in
0540. We now summarize this and estimate the total ejecta mass
of the elements we have discussed. The mass of O2+ ions in the
SNRC emitting [O iii] λ5007 is

M(O2+) ≈ 3.2 × 10−5

Here f[O iii]λ5007 is the dereddened ﬂux for one of the slit positions
with a slit correction included to account for the full SNRC. For
the SNRC we get f[O iii]λ5007 ∼ 3.0×10−13 erg cm−2 s−1. j[O iii]λ5007
is the emissivity of the λ5007 transition, which for T = 23 500 K
is ∼ 1.1 × 10−21 erg cm3 s−1 sr−1. For ne = 103 cm−3 one then
gets M(O2+) ∼ 9 × 10−5 M(cid:12).

Article number, page 21 of 30

A&A proofs: manuscript no. lundqvist_0540

A similar estimate for M(O+) from [O ii] λλ3726,3729 gives
M(O+) ∼ 5 × 10−5 M(cid:12) when we use T = 20 000 K (and from
this j[O iii]λλ3726,3729 ∼ 1.1 × 10−21 erg cm3 s−1 sr−1). A combined
mass of M(O+) + M(O2+) ∼ 1.4 × 10−4 M(cid:12) may seem like a
surprisingly low mass considering that about two solar masses of
oxygen should be present in 0540 (if similar to, e.g., SN 1987A).
However, this estimate is only for the amount of oxygen in the
SNRC that has been recently shocked. Those shocks are thin due
to intense radiative cooling. The cooling time, calculated from a
simple six-level model atom of pure O2+ at T = 30 000 K with
ne = 103 cm−3, is ∼ 0.02 years, and at T = 50 000 K it is
∼ 0.024 years. The similar numbers for pure O+ at T = 20 000 K
and T = 30 000 K are ∼ 0.023 years and ∼ 0.02 years. The
real cooling time is longer if the shocked gas starts out hotter
than T = 50 000 K, although this is not so important since the
cooling function for pure oxygen peaks around ∼ 2 × 105 K (cf.
Borlowski & Shull 1990), and falls monotonically towards lower
temperatures. More important is that the cooling is counteracted
by photoionization of ambients photons from the PWN. With
this in mind, a lower limit on the cooling time is ∼ 0.05 years.
Thus, ∼ 1.4 × 10−4 M(cid:12) has to be replenished every >∼ 0.05 years,
which means ∼ 0.3 M(cid:12) of shocked oxygen in >∼ 100 years.

Williams et al. (2008) did shock modeling for a similar situa-
tion where they assumed a low-velocity shock of 20 km s−1 aided
by photoionization of PWN photons to account for the heavy-
element ejecta lines. This is much lower than the shock veloc-
ity in Borlowski & Shull (1990) for Cas A, although that study
only included preionization by photons produced by the shock.
The oxygen column density of the emitting region in Williams
et al. (2008) is ∼ 1014 cm−2, and the mass ﬂux of ejecta ﬂowing
into the low-velocity shocks is ∼ 0.01 M(cid:12) yr−1, which appears
consistent with our estimate of <∼ 0.003 Xother M(cid:12) yr−1, where
Xother > 1 is the correction factor to include all elements, and not
only oxygen.

The mass fractions we estimated in Sect. 3.4.1 for the SNRC
of 0540, namely O : Ne : S : Ar = 1 : 0.07 : 0.10 : 0.02 and
H : He = 1 : >∼ 0.8, are thus sampled over a very small fraction
of the inner ejecta at any given time. How representative these
numbers are for all inner ejecta is not very clear. However, one
could imagine that there could be ﬂuctuations on moderate time
scales if the low-velocity shocks run into regions which are not
fully microscopically mixed. This could be the reason for the ap-
parent elevated sulphur abundance indicated by our NTT/EMMI
observations.

3.4.3. The halo and beyond

Added to the mass of the SNRC is the mass of ejecta in
the unshocked freely moving supernova ejecta. According to
Williams et al.
(2008), the inner part of this is photoion-
ized to O2+, so we use Equation 3 with ne = 1 cm−3 and
f[O iii]λ5007 ∼ 1.5 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1, which corresponds to
the integrated broad base of [O iii] emission in Fig. 19, and as-
suming that the VIMOS/IFU ﬁeld-of-view misses roughly one
third of the halo emission. For the photoionized halo we fur-
ther assume a temperature of ∼ 12 000 K, so that j[O iii]λ5007 ∼
4 × 10−22 erg cm3 s−1 sr−1. With these assumptions, the mass of
O2+ in the halo, M(O2+)halo ∼ 0.12 M(cid:12). The mass is most likely
higher since ne = 1 cm−3 only stems from the 4 a.m.u. at the in-
ner boundary of the unshocked SN ejecta estimated by Williams
et al. (2008). The average electron density could be ne < 1 cm−3
in the unshocked [O iii] emitting halo. According to Williams
et al.
(2008), enough ionizing photons are produced to ionize
∼ 1 M(cid:12) halo ejecta. In a mixed abundance model by Blinnikov

Fig. 25. Velocities estimated for emission lines from Filament F1. No
doublets/multiplets are included except [O ii] λλ3726,3729. As can be
seen, the wavelength calibration is stable across the spectrum. Interest-
ingly, there is a group of lines with LMC redshift, although the majority
has a redshift close to ∼ +120 km s−1 compared to LMC redshift. See
Table 3 and text for further details.

et al. (2000) for SN 1987A, which contains ∼ 2.0 M(cid:12) of oxygen
with a drop in mass fraction just short of 2 000 km s−1, the mass
fraction of oxygen falls from ∼ 0.3 from ∼ 1 300 km s−1 to well
below 0.1 at 2 000 km s−1. Choosing 0.1 for the 0540 halo makes
our estimate for M(O2+)halo consistent with the ionized mass es-
timated by Williams et al. (2008), and if the total oxygen mass
is similar to that in SN 1987A, roughly half of the oxygen is now
conﬁned to the ﬁlaments in the SNRC.

In SN 1987A, the total mass inside 2 000 km s−1 is domi-
nated by He, O and H (cf. Blinnikov et al. 2000). We may as-
sume the same situation for 0540. For a density of 4 a.m.u. at
the inner boundary of the halo, corresponding to Vhalo,inner ∼
1 200 km s−1, and an outer velocity for the ionized halo of
Vhalo,outer >∼ 1 900 km s−1 (as is indicated by our results here),
the total mass in this shell is ∼ 6.8 M(cid:12), assuming a ﬂat density
proﬁle of the unshocked ejecta (cf. Williams et al. 2008). This
compares well with the mixed model for SN 1987A by Blin-
(2000) in which the total mass inside the radius
nikov et al.
corresponding to this velocity is about 5 − 6 M(cid:12). It therefore
seems that 0540 and SN 1987A could be fairly similar, and per-
haps stem from progenitors with roughly similar zero-age-main
sequence masses. The main diﬀerence between the dynamics in
these events is of course the inﬂuence of a pulsar, which, if ex-
istent in SN 1987A (e.g., Cigan et al. 2019; Greco et al. 2021;
Alp et al. 2021), plays a much smaller role than in 0540. On top
of that, one has the 3D eﬀects stemming from the explosion hy-
drodynamics, and possibly pre-explosion rotation. In our mass
estimates for the halo we have compared with models assuming
1D, but from Sect. 3.1.1. it is evident that the halo is far from

Lundqvist et al.: Supernova remnant 0540-69.3

spherically symmetric. This obviously introduces uncertainties
in our mass estimates for the halo.

Moving further away from the SNRC, we introduced in Sect.
3.3.2 ﬁve interesting ﬁlaments which we have named F1-F5. For
all ﬁlaments, the spectral lines are unresolved, except for F1,
which displays broad bases of the [O iii] λλ4959,5007 line pro-
ﬁles, skewed to the red as compared to the positions of the nar-
row and strong (unresolved) peaks of these lines (cf. Fig. 24).
The minimum and maximum velocities of the base (relative to
LMC) are at least −900 km s−1 and +1 300 km s−1, with a pos-
sible extension in the red to even larger velocities. No such fea-
tures are seen in spectra of F2-F5. The presence of the broad
base is consistent with the fact that F1 is projected onto the re-
gion showing the faint [O iii] glow (cf. Fig. 10, top panel). As
seen in the lower panel of Fig. 10, high redshifted velocities
from the glow (which is emitted by the halo discussed above)
occur close to the position of F1. Despite its projected proximity
to the SNRC, the unresolved spectral components of ﬁlament F1
are therefore not part of the inner region of the SNR itself (see
also below).

In Sect. 3.2 we connected the maximum recession velocity
of the glow at F1 to the pulsar age. For a maximum velocity of
>∼ + 1 200 km s−1, the pulsar would be older than 1 200 years.
Fig. 24 shows that this could be the case. However, a maximum
velocity of +1 300 km s−1 at the position of F1 would imply
vtrue ∼ 2 130 km s−1 for a pulsar age of 1 200 years, which
in turn would correspond to a radius of ∼ 10(cid:48)(cid:48). 8 rather than
∼ 10(cid:48)(cid:48). 0 in Fig. 5 for the same expansion as vtrue in the west-
ward direction orthogonal to the line-of sight. Fig. 5 does not
really support this, which could indicate aspherical symmetry of
the fastest glow even on smaller scales. Unfortunately, the VI-
MOS/IFU ﬁeld does not reach this far from the pulsar to test the
degree of non-sphericity over a larger scale, but Fig. 19 shows
that even within the 13(cid:48)(cid:48) × 13(cid:48)(cid:48) ﬁeld of view of VIMOS, there
is large asymmetry of the fast “glow". However, at the position
of F1 speciﬁcally the broad base is fairly symmetric and less
redshifted than the emission from the SNRC (highlighted in red
in Fig. 24). Given the results in Sect. 3.2 and what is shown in
Fig. 24, the pulsar age is closer to 1 200 years than 1 100 years.
Given that the data we have analyzed were taken ∼ 20 years ago,
the pulsar age today should be close to 1 200 years.

Fig. 24 also shows the [O ii] λλ3726,3729 doublet along
with [Fe ii] λ5159, [Fe xiv] λ5303, and other lines as marked in
Fig. 24. [Fe ii] λ5159 and [Fe iii] λ5270 both showed hints of
broad wings for the SNRC. Nothing like that is seen for the po-
sition at F1, but this could be due to the limited signal-to-noise.
Of greater importance are the two spectral bumps on each side
of the central unresolved blend of the [O ii] doublet. One pos-
sible interpretation is that they originate in the same part of the
ejecta as the [O iii] halo, and possibly in its outermost part as a
result of a transition of the photoionized state from O2+ to O+,
at vtrue ∼ 2 000 km s−1. Another possibility is that the bumps are
due to Balmer lines emission from F1. We have marked the po-
sitions of them in the middle panel of Fig. 24. On the blue side
H i λλ3712,3722 emit at ≈ −1 249 km s−1 and ≈ −443 km s−1,
respectively (when we center on 3727.5 Å), but on the red side,
no H i line ﬁts. Moreover, the strengths of the λ3712 and λ3722
lines are expected to be < 1% of [O ii] λλ3726,3729, using Hβ
as template. Deeper observations are needed to test the [O ii]
interpretation, along with photoionization modeling like that in
Williams et al. (2008).

Closing in on the narrow components of the lines from the
ﬁlaments, the weighted velocity of individual lines can be used
to test both the physical velocity of the ﬁlaments and to check

possible systematics in the wavelength calibration. The calibra-
tion is problematic far in the very blue due to warped spec-
tra, which makes the velocities for [O ii] λλ3726,3729 system-
atically low. As an example, we show in Fig. 25 the veloci-
ties of the detected lines across the spectrum for F1. The ve-
locity of [O ii] λλ3726,3729 was estimated using 3727.5Å (see
below). We note that a group of lines tend to have LMC red-
shift, while most lines cluster at ∼ +120 km s−1 compared to
the LMC. The dashed lines in Fig. 25 shows 1σ uncertainty for
the wavelength solution. Taking the extremes of this ﬁt (i.e., the
solid line in the ﬁgure) to assign a combined uncertainty, we ar-
rive at 355 ± 30 km s−1 for F1. For the other ﬁlaments we ﬁnd
260±25 km s−1 for F2, 290±30 km s−1 for F3, 255±20 km s−1 for
F4 and 240 ± 20 km s−1 for F5. This means that all of them have
velocities consistent with LMC velocity, except for F1, which is
redshifted by an extra 85 ± 30 km s−1.

In Table 5 we list [O iii] temperatures of all ﬁlaments. The
temperatures were calculated in the same way as for the SNRC
in Sect. 3.3.2. For the ﬁlaments, we have assumed an electron
density of ne = 103 cm−3 (see below), but the diﬀerence in
estimated temperature is very small for electron densities in
the range 102 − few × 103 cm−3. The temperature is highest
for F1. If we include [O iii] λλ4959,5007 with its full base we
get (3.6 ± 0.4) × 104 K. However, from the Gaussian ﬁt for
[O iii] λ5007 in Fig. 25 we estimate that only ∼ 60% of the
ﬂux is in the spectrally unresolved component. If the base orig-
inates in a photoionized halo with a presumed temperature of
<∼ 2 × 104 K, no base is expected to be detected from F1 for
the weak [O iii] λ4363 line, which is also conﬁrmed by our data.
For the unresolved component, a better estimate of the [O iii]
temperature could therefore be >∼ 5.5 × 104 K. For the other ﬁl-
aments we estimate (3.0 ± 0.4) × 104 K (F2), (1.8 ± 0.2) × 104 K
(F3) (1.9 ± 0.2) × 104 K (F4) and (2.5 ± 0.4) × 104 K (F5). The
temperatures are somewhat higher than reported in our prelimi-
nary analysis in Seraﬁmovich et al. (2005). For the central peak
of [O ii] λλ3726,3729, we tested possible skewness to reveal the
density of F1 (cf. Sect. 3.4.1 for how I[O ii] λ3729/I[O ii] λ3726 de-
pends on density). Unfortunately, the spectral resolution is too
poor to draw any such conclusions.

The spectra of all ﬁlaments show many forbidden iron lines.
Filaments F1 and F3 have lines of [Fe ii] and [Fe iii], whereas F2
also shows [Fe v] λ4227. Filaments F1, F4 and F5 show the very
highly ionized [Fe xiv] λ5303 (cf. Fig. 25), possibly with some
contamination from [Ca v] λ5309. There is also a line at λ5537.9
for F1 that could be [Ar x] λ5534. Based on these ﬁndings, the
X-ray morphology of the remnant, the ﬁlament dispositions (cf.
Fig. 2), and the high temperatures of the ﬁlaments, it is likely that
ﬁlaments F1, F2, F4 and F5 are ionized by the SNR, most likely
through shock activity. Filament F3 sits 1(cid:48).4 east of the pulsar and
has no physical connection to the remnant. However, it is not a
normal H ii region in the LMC. Typical [O iii] temperatures in,
e.g., the 30 Doradus region vary rather mildly (±140 K) from
the average value of 10 270 K (Krabbe & Copetti 2002). The
high [O iii] temperature of F3, 18 000 ± 2 000 K, suggests that
it too is aﬀected by the remnant, presumably through intense
photoionization by high-energy photons.

Brantseg et al. (2014) studied the radio and X-ray emission
from 0540, and we note that one of the regions they studied in
detail includes our ﬁlament F4. Their models of the detected X-
ray emission from this region indicate a shock temperature of
Ts ∼ 7 × 106 K. Three of the ﬁve other outer SNR regions they
studied have similar temperatures, whereas the two others are
cooler and hotter by a factor of ∼ 2. Using the Rankine-Hugoniot
relations for fully ionized plasma, this translates into a shock

speed of Vs ∼ 510 km s−1 for the region including F4 (e.g.,
Brantseg et al. 2014). Brantseg et al.
(2014) argue for a suf-
ﬁciently short timescale for temperature equilibration between
electrons and ions, and we will use this here as well. Brantseg
et al.
(2014) also estimated the electron density of the X-ray-
emitting regions, and arrive at ne ∼ a few cm−3, and for the re-
gion including F4 in particular, ne ∼ 4.0+0.6

−0.3 cm−3.

A shock with velocity Vs ∼ 510 km s−1 can collisionally
ionize iron up to Fe18+, with almost no iron in Fe13+ if the
plasma is in collisional equilibrium (e.g., Arnaud & Raymond
1992). However, with the low densities in the shocks studied by
Brantseg et al. (2014), collisional equilibrium is not fully estab-
lished, and one has instead to resort to non-equilibrium ioniza-
tion. More speciﬁcally, the collisional ionization time-scale of
Fe13+ to Fe14+ is

tion(Fe13+) ≈ 3.2

where Cion(Fe13+) is the collisional ionization rate coeﬃcient
for collisions from Fe13+. We use the formalism of Arnaud &
Rothenﬂug (1985) which gives Cion(Fe13+) ≈ 6.8×10−10 cm3 s−1
for Ts ∼ 7 × 106 K, which means tion(Fe13+) ∼ 12 years for ne =
4.0 cm−3. The corresponding time scales tion(Fe14+), tion(Fe15+)
and tion(Fe16+) are ∼ 15 years, ∼ 29 years and ∼ 230 years,
respectively. For young enough shocks, there will certainly be
no iron ionized beyond Fe16+, and for shocks younger than a
couple of decades, Fe13+ should still be present. Brantseg et al.
(2014) estimate an ionization time scale of ∼ 1600 years for
ne = 4.0 cm−3, which seems unreasonably long for F4, unless the
density of the shocked gas is substantially higher than 4.0 cm−3.
This could be the case for a low ﬁlling factor of the shocked gas.
The ionization time scales should be compared with recom-
bination time scales, and for the recombination from Fe13+ to
Fe12+, trec(Fe13+), we write

trec(Fe13+) ≈ 317

(2006), i.e., αrec(Fe13+) ≈ 1.55 ×
the results of Schmidt et al.
10−11cm3 s−1 at Ts ∼ 7×106 K, we get trec(Fe13+) ∼ 510 years for
ne = 4.0 cm−3. This means that once ionized to Fe13+, the ISM
shocked by SNR 0540-69.3 would not have time to recombine.
Collisional ionization to Fe14+ is far superior, which immediately
shows that the low-density shocked ISM with ne = 4.0 cm−3 is
not the source of the low-ionization lines from ﬁlament F4.

This is further strengthened if we study the cooling time of
the shocked gas. For this we use an expression for the shocked
circumstellar matter of SN 1987A, which reads (Gröningsson
et al. 2006), valid for 100 km s−1 <∼ Vs <∼ 600 km s−1,

Here nﬁlament is the density of the ﬁlament. Even though this ex-
pression was tailored for the enriched He and N abundances of
SN 1987A, it is obvious that the cooling time for 0540 is far too
long for the shocked gas to cool down to the temperature derived
from [O iii].

From our discussion we ﬁnd that the shocks running into the
low-density ISM are adiabatic. Fe13+ is most likely in a transi-
tory state to becoming further ionized, although full collisional
equilibrium will not be attained. This plasma cannot be the same

Article number, page 24 of 30

as that emitting low-ionization like, e.g., [O iii] (see below). The
situation could therefore be similar to that in the Cygnus Loop
(Ballet et al. 1989; Fesen & Hurford 1996; Raymond et al.
2015), N49, N63A, N103b and SN 1987A in the LMC (Danziger
& Dennefeld 1976; Murdin et al. 1978; Dopita & Mathewson
1979; Gröningsson et al. 2006; Dopita et al. 2019), Puppis A
(Clark et al. 1979) and SNR S8 in IC 1613 (Fesen & Weil 2020),
all in which coronal iron lines coexist with lower-ionization iron
lines. The situation is diﬀerent from that in, e.g., SNR 1E0102.2-
7219 in the SMC (Vogt et al. 2017), where only coronal lines are
seen, nicely tracing the blast wave. We return to [Fe xiv] λ5303
below.

The low-ionization lines from F1, F2, F4 and F5 likely orig-
inate as results of shocks with lower velocity than the shocks
studied by Brantseg et al. (2014). From Filament F1 we detect
Fe6+ lines, and in collisional equilibrium this ion peaks in abun-
dance at ∼ (2 − 3) × 105 K, corresponding to a shock speed of
∼ 100 km s−1. Since we expect the shock speed in the ﬁlaments
to scale as ∝ n1/2
ﬁlament, the density of the ﬁlaments emitting the
low-ionization lines should be ∼ 4.0 (VX−ray/Vopt)2 cm−3, where
VX−ray and Vopt are the shock speeds in the X-ray emitting region
and low-ionization line emitting region, respectively. This points
to nﬁlament ∼ 102 cm−3 for the low-ionization line emitting re-
gions. According to Equation 5, this would mean tcool ∼ 13 years
(for Vopt = 100 km s−1). These shocks are therefore radiative (as
opposed to the adiabatic shock created by the blast wave). If the
postshock gas is in near pressure equilibrium, the density in the
[O iii]-emitting region should be a factor of ∼ 10 higher than that
emitting [Fe vii] lines, i.e., ∼ 103 cm−3. This justiﬁes our choice
of 103 cm−3 when we estimated the [O iii] temperature earlier in
this subsection. A decisive measurement for this picture would
be to measure the density from [O ii] and/or [S ii]. Unfortunately,
[S ii] emits outside the spectral range of our ﬁlament spectra, and
the spectral resolution is too low to draw conclusions from [O ii].
While four of our ﬁlaments have velocities consistent with
LMC velocity, Figs. 24 and 25 show that ﬁlament F1 recedes by
85 ± 30 km s−1 compared to the others. This is also the only ﬁl-
ament which is not situated at, or outside the projected position
of the blast wave. According to the Rankine-Hugoniot shock re-
lations for polytropic index γ = 5/3, this means that the shocked
gas in the low-ionixzation line-emitting medium is accelerated
to 3Vopt/4. For a spherically- symmetric model with a shock ra-
dius corresponding to ∼ 20(cid:48)(cid:48) − 25(cid:48)(cid:48) at the distance of LMC, and
8(cid:48)(cid:48). 5 for the projected distance between the pulsar and F1, the ob-
served 85 ± 30 km s−1 for F1 translates into 90 ± 35 km s−1. If we
correct for the factor 4/3, we arrive at Vopt = 120 ± 45 km s−1,
which is fully consistent with what we estimated from the esti-
mated shock velocity required to ionize up to Fe6+ for a radiative
shock being responsible for the low-ionization lines. In reality,
there are most likely a range of shock velocities depending on
the distribution of densities, much in the same way as for the
well-studied inner ring of SN 1987A (Gröningsson et al. 2006).
We reiterate that the broad and narrow lines from the F1 region
come from completely diﬀerent components; the broad [O iii]
lines come from the halo of freely coasting SN ejecta, while the
narrow lines from the shocks at the SNR front on the rear side
of the remnant, presumably some ∼ 20(cid:48)(cid:48) − 25(cid:48)(cid:48) from the pulsar.
Filaments F2, F4 and F5 are moving mainly orthogonal to the
line-of-sight, and do not show any blue- or redshift compared to
LMC velocity.

In this picture, the [Fe xiv] λ5303 velocity for F1 should
be more redshifted than lines from low-ionization ions, i.e., if
it comes from behind the blast wave. Although [Fe xiv] λ5303

The electron density is from [S ii] λλ6716,6731, and the velocity of the emitting gas is LMC rest velocity. See text for further details.

may be slightly more redshifted than the bulk of emission lines
(cf. Table 3 and Fig. 25), we do not see a several hundred
km s−1 diﬀerence in velocity. There could be at least two ex-
planations for this. The ﬁrst is that we have misinterpreted an-
other spectral line for being [Fe xiv] λ5303, and the second is
that if [Fe xiv] λ5303 is indeed the correct identiﬁcation, it is
not emitted immediately behind the inter-cloud fast shock. In-
stead it originates from closer to the clouds. To check the ﬁrst
explanation, we focus on the right panels of Fig. 25 in which
the stronger iron lines peak around 130 − 140 km s−1, whereas
[Fe xiv] λ5303 peaks at ∼ 180 km s−1. The Gaussian ﬁt to
[Fe xiv] λ5303 is consistent with a single feature. The FWHM
is ≈ 335 km s−1, so any thermal broadening of the line is im-
possible to trace. That the line may appear somewhat broader
than the Gaussian ﬁt is likely due to poor signal-to-noise. In
the line list by Fesen & Hurford (1996), there are a few lines
close to [Fe xiv] λ5303, namely [Fe ii] λ5297 and [Ca v] λ5309.
(None of them marked in Fig. 25). Their velocities relative to
[Fe xiv] λ5303 are −340 km s−1 and +357 km s−1, respectively.
Whereas theire is no hint for the [Fe ii] line, [Ca v] line could be
responsible for a possible slight extension of the [Fe xiv] λ5303
main part of the line feature. This is why we have added the
[Ca v] λ5309 line in Tables 3 and 4. That [Fe xiv] λ5303 is
present seems solid.

But why is then [Fe xiv] λ5303 from F1 not more redshifted
than the lower-ionization iron lines in Fig. 25? The results of
Miceli et al.
(2006) may provide a clue. These authors per-
formed 2D axial symmetric simulations of a fast shock interact-
ing with a cloud in a tenuous medium. The setup was intended to
model the X-ray emission from the Vela SNR, but general con-
clusions can be drawn. They tested two geometries, a spherical
cloud, and an elliptical cloud with major axis along the shock
direction (to simulate a ﬁlament). In the spherical cloud case
(which we will concentrate on), the shock interaction results in
something like a two-temperature situation, where soft X-rays
are produced in the transmitted shock in the cloud, and a higher-
temperature region in the shocked tenuous medium emits harder
X-rays. What is important is that the hard X-ray emission does
not mainly come from region immediately behind the blast wave.
It instead comes from a halo around the cloud. Conduction be-
tween the cloud and the hot shocked tenuous medium drives an

evaporation of the cloud and the formation of a hot diﬀuse halo.
We suggest that [Fe xiv] λ5303 originates in this zone along with
the hard X-rays. As this zone is tied to the cloud, there should
not be any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in velocity as determined from
the line proﬁles. Future tests of this scenario would be to study
the 0540 ﬁlaments in higher spectral resolution, as well as in
the red part of the spectrum to probe, e.g., [Fe x] λ6374 and
[Fe xi] λ7892, as well as to measure the [S ii] density.

Moving to regions in the south-western part of SNR 0540-
69.3, the possibly N-rich ﬁlament identiﬁed by Mathewson et al.
(1980) is outside the reach of our slits and and the ﬁeld-of-
view of the VIMOS/IFU of Sandin et al.
(2013). However,
our NTT/EMMI slit covers a region close to it which shows
strong nebular emission. In Fig. 26 we show this region and its
spectrum, dereddened using EB−V = 0.19, and normalized to
[O iii] λ5007. (The region discussed by Mathewson et al. 1980,
is marked with an “M".) The electron density from [S ii] in the
yellow-marked region along the EMMI slit is <∼ 102 cm−3, which
is fully consistent with an H ii region in the LMC, as is also the
velocity of the emitting region. However, there is an oddity with
the overall spectrum in that it is very red. With EB−V = 0.19 the
Balmer decrement Hα/Hβ ∼ 5.0., which is almost a factor of
≈ 1.8 higher than expected from an H ii region. The simplest so-
lution to this is that the emission comes from an H ii region, but
that EB−V ∼ 0.95 for this area rather than the value we use for
0540. From a visual inspection of Fig. 1 it is clear that the neb-
ulous emission is less pronounced in an area that includes both
the yellow part along the slit in Fig. 26 and the region M high-
lighted by Mathewson et al. (1980). Absence of [O iii]-emission
is also vero clearly seen for this region in Figure 1A of Mathew-
son et al. (1980). Such patchy structure is expected if there are
dusty regions embedded in a large H ii region like N 158 (Heinze
1956) with its superbubble around the OB association LH 104 in
the north (Lucke & Hodgei 1970; Testor& Niemela 1998). which
dominates this part of the LMC. Finally, we note that the ﬁlter
(1980) to study [N ii] was centered
used by Mathewson et al.
on 6584 Å with a FWHM of 16 Å. With an LMC redshift of
270 km s−1, Hα is redshifted to ∼ 6569 Å and [N ii] λ6584 to
6589Å. In the spectrum of Fig. 26, I[N ii]λ6584/IHα ∼ 2.2, and if
this is also the case for region “M", ∼ 20% of the emission in
the 6584 Å ﬁlter used by Mathewson et al. (1980) is due to Hα

(if Gaussian), however, the exact fraction being sensitive to the
transparency of the blue wing of their 6584 Å ﬁlter.

4. Conclusions

A combination of [O iii] ﬁlters centered on 0 km s−1 and
+3 000 km s−1 was used to reveal structures in the central part of
SNR 0540-69.3 (SNRC), not previously detected by HST ﬁlters,
and disproves some structures indicated by the VLT/VIMOS
integral-ﬁeld-unit (IFU) observations by Sandin et al.
(2013).
We detect [O iii] emission out to ∼ 10(cid:48)(cid:48) from the pulsar, which
corresponds to an average ejecta velocity of ∼ 2 000 km s−1 for
an age of 1 200 years. The ﬁlter images complement the IFU
images in [O iii] to suggest ring-like structures around a symme-
try axis from north-east to south-west, also seen in [S ii] (Sandin
et al. 2013). In a 3D-representation, the symmetry axis crosses
the projected pulsar position ∼ 500 km s−1 on the receding side
of the remnant, which if it is due to pulsar activity, could indi-
cate that the pulsar shares the same general redshift as the SNRC.
Such pulsar activity could occur if the pulsar jet is oriented along
this axis rather than as displayed in Fig. 6. It is emphasized that
there is evidence for substantial past and present activity along
the suggested jet axis (cf. Lundqvist et al. 2011), but the rings
could also have an origin related to the supernova explosion.

SNR 0540-69.3 was also studied through two slits roughly
orthogonal to each other (PA = 22◦ and PA = 88◦). Several new
spectral lines are identiﬁed for the SNRC, and 2D spectroscopy
along the slits reveals fast [O iii]-emitting ejecta outside the
SNRC corresponding to a space velocity of vtrue ∼ 2 100 km s−1
on the receding western part. This velocity agrees with our imag-
ing, as well as a pulsar age of ≈ 1 200 years. In the southwest on
the receding side of vtrue >∼ + 2 200 km s−1. On the approaching
side, the [O iii] emission reaches vtrue ∼ 1 900 km s−1. Although
substantially weaker, [Ne iii] emission has similar structure to
that of [O iii], whereas [O ii], [S ii], [Ar iii] and Hβ are emitted
by the more compact structure of the SNRC, in agreement with
the [S ii] IFU image of Sandin et al.
(2013). The luminosity-
weighted average of the lines is +440 ± 80 km s−1 with respect
to the host galaxy, which is accord with previous ﬁndings, as
well as the possible pulsar motion.

The average [O iii] temperature of the SNRC is 23 500 ±
1 800 K, which is somewhat
than previously re-
ported, mainly because we have included a correction of the
[O iii] λ4363 ﬂux due to the blend with Hγ. The electron density
derived from [S ii] λλ6716,6731 is found to be ne ∼ 103 cm−3,
which is slightly higher than in the density map of Sandin et al.
(2013).

lower

The VIMOS/IFU data of Sandin et al. (2013) were used to
construct slit correction factors for our spectroscopic data in or-
der to estimate overall abundances and masses of various ele-
ments in the SNRC. Infrared data from Spitzer (Williams et al.
2008) were also included in these estimates. In particular, rel-
ative mass ratios were found to be O : Ne : S : Ar ≈ 1 : 0.07 :
0.10 : 0.02. Those ratios are consistent with explosion models of
13 − 20 M(cid:12) progenitors (e.g., Chieﬃ & Limongi 2013; Sieverd-
ing et al. 2020), as well as SN 1987A (cf. Jerkstrand et al. 2011).
The argon abundance is a factor of ∼ 2 lower than used in the
models by Williams et al. (2008) (which was also suggested by
those authors as a possibility). The fact that we detect H and He
mixed in deep into the central region is a clear sign of explosive
mixing, as in SN 1987A. The mass ratio of He/H in the SNRC
is estimated to be at least ∼ 0.8, which is another similarity with
SN 1987A.

Article number, page 26 of 30

The mass of [O ii] and [O iii] emitting oxygen in the SNRC
is only ∼ 1.4 × 10−4 M(cid:12), but the cooling time of shocked
gas in the SNRC is so short ( >∼ 0.05 years) that the mass ﬂux
through the low-velocity shocks in the SNRC can be up to
∼ 0.003 Xother M(cid:12) yr−1, where Xother is the correction factor to in-
clude all elements, not only oxygen. This is on the low side com-
pared with ∼ 0.01 M(cid:12) yr−1 estimated by Williams et al. (2008).
The rapid cooling of the shocked gas in the SNRC could in prin-
ciple make it possible to detect ﬂuctuations in the ﬂux of lines
other than those from oxygen if the SNRC is not microscopically
mixed. We note a possible such ﬂuctuations in [S ii]λλ6716,6731
between 1989–2006. This eﬀect could potentially make abun-
dance estimates for the whole SNRC vulnerable for elements
other than oxygen in the SNRC. IFU images for various spec-
tral lines separated in time be several years could resolve this
uncertainty.

The fastest emitting [O iii] ejecta (which have components
with velocities in excess of 2 000 km s−1) come from a freely
coasting halo of photoionized supernova ejecta. The mass of the
halo is ∼ 0.12 M(cid:12) if spherical symmetry is assumed. However,
the halo shows clear asymmetry with no detectable emission on
the receding side to the north and only weak emission on the
approaching side to the south. On the approaching side, there
appears to be a “wall"-like feature centered slightly to the north-
west of the projected pulsar position and it has velocities more
blueward than ∼ −750 km s−1. We have used the VIMOS/IFU
results of Sandin et al. (2013) to constrain that structure. There
is a hint of [O ii]λλ3726,3729 emission from fast photoionized
ejecta (both approaching and receding), which would mark the
outer boundary of the photoionized region. Oxygen-rich ejecta
out to ∼ 2 000−2 200 km s−1, and a total mass of oxygen which is
∼ 2 M(cid:12) are yet other similarities with SN 1987A (cf. Jerkstrand
et al. 2011, and references therein for properties of SN 1987A).
However, for 0540 most of the oxygen is likely to be located in
ﬁlaments in a pulsar-wind nebula, which for SN 1987A is not
the case.

A third slit was placed along the western part of the super-
nova remnant shock. Two optical ﬁlaments, named F4 and F5,
are detected for this slit position, and three further ﬁlaments (F1,
F2 and F3) are identiﬁed for the PA = 88◦ slit. Although hav-
ing an [O iii] temperature of 18 000 ± 2 000 K, ﬁlament F3 lies
too far from SNR 0540-69.3 to be physically connected to it,
and is most likely an H ii region in the vicinity of the remnant.
The other ﬁlaments are hotter, and three of them (F2, F4 and F5)
show [Fe xiv] λ5303 emission. The hottest (F1), with an [O iii]
temperature in excess of 55 000 K, is redshifted by 85±30 km s−1
relative to the LMC redshift, and is located only 8(cid:48)(cid:48). 5 west of the
pulsar. We argue that the redshift was acquired when F1 was
shocked by the SNR blast wave. Similar acceleration for F2, F4
and F5 would have occurred orthogonal to the line of sight since
they show no red- or blueshift. Filament F4 overlaps with a re-
gion studied in X-rays by Brantseg et al. (2014), and including
temperatures and densities from the X-ray modeling by these
authors, we conclude that most of the optical lines from F1, F2,
F4 and F5 come from radiative shocks in ISM clouds, overtaken
by the supernova blastwave. The electron density of the [O iii]
emitting gas is estimated to be ∼ 103 cm−3. Lines from more
highly ionized ions, and in particular [Fe xiv] λ5303, are argued
to come from an evaporation zone in connection with the ra-
diatively cooled gas. Future observations of these ﬁlaments at
higher spectral resolution is needed to test these conclusions.

Finally, a portion of the slit with PA = 22◦ was used to probe
a region close to a possibly N-rich ﬁlament identiﬁed by Math-
(1980). Our spectrum reveals that the emission is

highly reddened with a Balmer decrement of Hα/Hβ ∼ 5.0, and
that the emitting gas has a low electron density ( <∼ 102 cm−3).
It is most likely emission from an H ii region unrelated to the
supernova. The severe reddening boosts red lines compared to,
e.g., [O iii] which is weak in this region. The [N ii] ﬁlter used by
(1980) could also have been aﬀected by Hα
Mathewson et al.
emission. An N-rich supernova ﬁlament in this region therefore
seems unlikely.
