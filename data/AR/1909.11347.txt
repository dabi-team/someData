A Geometric Vietoris-Begle Theorem, with an Application to

Convex Subsets of Topological Vector Lattices

Andrew McLennan∗

August 10, 2021

Abstract

We show that if L is a topological vector lattice, u : L → L is the function u(x) = x ∨ 0,

C ⊂ L is convex, and D = u(C) is metrizable, then D is an ANR and u|C : C → D is a

homotopy equivalence, so D is contractible and thus an AR. This is proved by verifying the

hypotheses of a second result:

if X is a connected space that is homotopy equivalent to an

ANR, Y is an ANR, and f : X → Y is a continuous surjection such that, for each y ∈ Y and
each neighborhood V ⊂ Y of y, there is a neighborhood V ′ ⊂ V of y such that f −1(V ′) can
be contracted in f −1(V ), then f is a homotopy equivalence. The latter result is a geometric
analogue of the Vietoris-Begle theorem.

Introduction

The project this paper reports on began with a seemingly simple question. Let u : Rn → Rn
+
be the function u(x) = (max{x1, 0}, . . . , max{xn, 0}). If C ⊂ Rn is convex and D = u(C), is D
contractible? Easily visualized examples such as a disk pierced by the corner of R3
+ suggest an
aﬃrmative answer. It is not hard to prove that D is contractible when C is a line or line segment,

but the argument does not easily generalize.

To see why this question might appeal to a mathematical economist, we review some ﬁxed

point theory. If X and Y are topological spaces, a correspondence F : X → Y is an assignment of

a nonempty F (x) ⊂ Y to each x ∈ X. Such an F is convex (compact, etc.) valued if each F (x) is

convex (compact, etc.), and F is upper hemicontinuous if, for each x ∈ X and each open V ⊂ Y

containing F (x), there is a neighborhood U of x such that F (x′) ⊂ V for all x′ ∈ U . The Kakutani
ﬁxed point theorem asserts that if C ⊂ Rn is nonempty, compact, and convex, and F : C → C
is an upper hemicontinuous, compact, convex valued correspondence, then there is an x∗ ∈ C
such that x∗ ∈ F (x∗). This extension of the Brouwer ﬁxed point theorem is used to prove the

fundamental equilibrium existence results for game theory and general economic equilibrium, and

it (and its inﬁnite dimensional extensions) are frequently applied throughout economic theory.

Insofar as the conclusion of the Kakutani ﬁxed point theorem is topological, the geometric

hypotheses seem perhaps too strong. Eilenberg and Montgomery [9] showed how they can be

relaxed. A space Z is acyclic with respect to a homology theory H∗ with associated reduced
homology ˜H∗ (cohomology theory H ∗ with associated reduced cohomology ˜H ∗) if ˜Hn(Z) = 0
( ˜H n(Z) = 0) for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Recall that a metric space X is an absolute retract (AR)
if, whenever e : X → Z is an embedding of X as a closed subset of a metric space Z, there is

a retraction r : Z → e(X). The Eilenberg-Montgomery ﬁxed point theorem asserts that if C

is a nonempty compact AR and F : C → C is an upper hemicontinuous correspondence that is
compact and acyclic (for Vietoris homology) valued, then there is an x∗ ∈ C such that x∗ ∈ F (x∗).

Since homology and cohomology are invariant under homotopy, a contractible space is acyclic

for any homology or cohomology theory. We can imagine composing a convex valued corre-

spondence with u to obtain a contractible valued correspondence, then applying the Eilenberg-

Montgomery theorem. To be honest, what I initially thought might be an application of this sort

turned out to be a mirage, and I know of no actual economic application, but nevertheless the

issue still seems quite interesting.

We can place our problem in a more general setting. A vector lattice or Riesz space is a vector

space L over the reals endowed with a partial order ≥ such that: a) if x ≥ y, then x + z ≥ y + z for

all z ∈ L and αx ≥ αy for all α ≥ 0; b) any two elements x, y ∈ L have a least upper bound x ∨ y

and a greatest lower bound x ∧ y. Fix such an L. The lattice cone of L is L+ = { x ∈ L : x ≥ 0 }.
Let u : L → L+ be the function u(x) = x ∨ 0. (For any a ∈ L all of our results hold equally, with
obvious modiﬁcations, for the functions x 7→ x ∨ a and x 7→ x ∧ a.)

An important basic result ([1, p. 5]) is that L is a distributive lattice:

x ∨ (y ∧ z) = (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ z)

and x ∧ (y ∨ z) = (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z)

for all x, y, z ∈ L. Two other basic results will be important. Let | · | : L → L+ be the function
|x| = (x ∨ 0) − (x ∧ 0).

Lemma 1. For all x0, x1 ∈ L and t ∈ [0, 1],

u(x0)−|u(x1)−u(x0)| ≤ u(x0)∧u(x1) ≤ u((1−t)x0 +tx1) ≤ u(x0)∨u(x1) ≤ u(x0)+|u(x1)−u(x0)|.

2

Proof. For the ﬁrst inequality we have the general computation

y0 − |y1 − y0| = y0 + (y1 − y0) ∧ 0 − (y1 − y0) ∨ 0 ≤ y0 + (y1 − y0) ∧ 0 = y1 ∧ y0.

For the second inequality we compute that

u(x0) ∧ u(x1) = (x0 ∨ 0) ∧ (x1 ∨ 0) = (x0 ∧ x1) ∨ 0 = ((1 − t)(x0 ∧ x1) + t(x0 ∧ x1)) ∨ 0

≤ ((1 − t)x0 + tx1) ∨ 0 = u((1 − t)x0 + tx1).

The third and fourth inequalities follow from symmetric computations.

Corollary 1. For each y ∈ L+, u−1(y) is convex.

A set A ⊂ L is solid if, for all y ∈ A, A contains all x ∈ L such that |x| ≤ |y|. If, in addition to

being a Riesz space, L is a (not necessarily Hausdorﬀ) topological vector space and its topology

has a base at the origin consisting of solid sets, then L is locally solid, and a topological vector

lattice. A result of Roberts and Namioka ([1, p. 55]) asserts that L is locally solid if and only if
the function (x, y) 7→ x ∨ y is uniformly continuous1, and this is the case if and only if the function

(x, y) 7→ x ∧ y is uniformly continuous. (It is possible ([1, p. 56]) that u is continuous even when

L is not locally solid.) From this point forward we assume that L is a topological vector lattice.

Recall that a metric space X is an absolute neighborhood retract (ANR) if, whenever e : X → Z

is an embedding of X as a closed subset of another metric space Z, there is a neighborhood U ⊂ Z

of e(X) and a retraction r : U → e(X). An ANR is an AR if and only if it is contractible ([10,

11.2]).

If C ⊂ L is convex, then for any x0 ∈ C the contraction c : C × [0, 1] → C given by
c(x, t) = (1 − t)x + tx0 is continuous by virtue of the continuity of the vector operations (even if
L is not locally convex) so C is contractible, and thus an AR if it is an ANR.

Our ﬁrst main result is:

Theorem 1. If C ⊂ L is convex and D = u(C) is metrizable, then D is an ANR and u|C : C → D

is a homotopy equivalence, so D is an AR.

Remark: Among various ways that D may be metrizable even if L is not, we mention that

Varadarajan [21] has shown that if L is the space of measures on a compact metric space with

the weak topology, then L+ is metrizable, but L itself is metrizable only under quite restrictive
conditions. This case is common in economic applications.

The next result is one of the key ideas of the proof of Theorem 1.

for all x, y, x

Proposition 1. If y ∈ L+ and U ⊂ L is a neighborhood of the origin, then there is a neighborhood
W ⊂ U of the origin such that the convex hull of u−1(y + W ) is contained in u−1(y + U ).

Lemma 2. For any neighborhood U ⊂ L of the origin there is a neighborhood V ⊂ U of the origin

such that w ∈ U whenever u, v ∈ V , w ∈ L, and u ≤ w ≤ v.

Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that U is solid. Since ∨, ∧, and the vector

operations are continuous, there is a neighborhood V of the origin such that −(u ∧ 0) + (v ∨ 0) ∈ U

for all u, v ∈ V . If u, v ∈ V , w ∈ L, and u ≤ w ≤ v, then u ∧ 0 ≤ w ∧ 0 and w ∨ 0 ≤ v ∨ 0, so

|w| ≤ −(u ∧ 0) + (v ∨ 0) and thus w ∈ U .

Proof of Proposition 1. Lemma 2 gives a neighborhood V ⊂ U of the origin such that w ∈ U

whenever u, v ∈ V and u ≤ w ≤ v. Since ∨, ∧, and the vector operations are continuous, there

is a neighborhood W of the origin such that y0 − |y0 − y1| − y, y0 + |y0 − y1| − y ∈ V for all
y0, y1 ∈ y + W . For any x0, x1 ∈ u−1(y + W ) and any t ∈ [0, 1] we have u(x0) − |u(x0) −
u(x1)|, u(x0) + |u(x0) − u(x1)| ∈ y + V and therefore u((1 − t)x0 + tx1) ∈ y + U by virtue of
Lemma 1.

2 A Suﬃcient Condition for Homotopy Equivalence

Following Milnor [18] let W0 be the class of spaces which have the homotopy type of a countable
CW-complex. As Milnor explains, results of Whitehead [24] and Hanner [11] imply that W0 is
also the class of all spaces that have the homotopy type of a separable ANR, the class of all spaces

that have the homotopy type of a countable locally ﬁnite simplicial complex, and the class of all
spaces that are dominated2 by a countable CW-complex.

Let X and Y be topological spaces, and let f : X → Y be a map, A compressive pair for
f is a pair (V ′, V ) where V and V ′ are open subsets of Y with V ′ ⊂ V such that f −1(V ′) is
contractible in f −1(V ): there is a continuous ξ : f −1(V ′) × [0, 1] → f −1(V ) such that ξ(·, 0) is the
identity function of f −1(V ′) and ξ(·, 1) is a constant function. We say that f is compressive if it

is surjective and, for every y ∈ Y and every neighborhood V ⊂ Y of y, there is a neighborhood
V ′ of y such that (V ′, V ) is a compressive pair. Evidently Proposition 1 implies that:

Lemma 3. u|C : C → D is compressive.

Theorem 1 will follow from this and Theorem 2, which is our second main result. Prior results

similar to Theorem 2 include various results in Section 3 of [2] and Proposition 2.1.8 of [23]. In all

2A space P dominates a space X if there are maps f : X → P and g : P → X such that gf ≃ 1.

4

of those results X and Y are assumed to be compact and ﬁnite dimensional, and the assumption

imposed on the ﬁbers of f is (in eﬀect) that they are compact AR’s.

Theorem 2. If X is a connected element of W0, Y is an ANR, and f : X → Y is a compressive
surjection, then f is a homotopy equivalence.

Fix X, Y , and f : X → Y satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 2. The remainder of this

section proves Theorem 2 by verifying the hypotheses of the following result, which is Theorem 1
of [24] with slightly less reﬁned hypotheses. It has come to be known as Whitehead’s theorem 3.

Proposition 2. If X and Y are connected elements of W0, then a surjective map f : X → Y is
a homotopy equivalence if and only if f∗ : πn(X) → πn(Y ) is an isomorphism for all n = 1, 2, . . ..

A compressive cover for f is a collection V of compressive pairs such that { V ′ : (V ′, V ) ∈ V }

is a locally ﬁnite cover of Y . For any open cover U of Y there is a compressive cover V such that
for all (V ′, V ) ∈ V, V ∈ U : since f is compressive, there is a collection Z of compressive pairs
(V ′, V ) such that V ∈ U and { V ′ : (V ′, V ) ∈ Z } is a cover of Y , and since Y is metric, hence
paracompact, { V ′ : (V ′, V ) ∈ Z } has a locally ﬁnite reﬁnement. We say that a compressive cover
˜V is a star reﬁnement of V if, for each ( ˜V ′, ˜V ) ∈ ˜V, there is a (V ′, V ) ∈ V such that

[
0 , ˜V0)∈ ˜V, ˜V0∩ ˜V 6=∅

( ˜V ′

˜V0 ⊂ V ′.

Lemma 4. For any compressive cover V there is an compressive cover ˜V that star reﬁnes it.

Proof. Since Y is metric, [7, VIII.3] gives a reﬁnement U of { V ′ : (V ′, V ) ∈ V } such that for
SU ′∈U ,U ∩U ′6=∅ U ′ ⊂ V ′ for some (V ′, V ) ∈ V. As we pointed out above, there is a

each U ∈ U ,
compressive cover ˜V such that for all ( ˜V ′, ˜V ) ∈ ˜V, ˜V ∈ U .

The Arens-Eells embedding theorem (e.g., [10, p. 597]) implies that Y can be isometrically

embedded as a closed subset of a normed linear space NY . Fix a retraction sY : VY → Y of a

neighborhood VY ⊂ NY of Y . Let WY ⊂ Y ×Y be a neighborhood of the diagonal { (y, y) : y ∈ Y }

such that (1 − t)y0 + ty1 ∈ VY for all (y0, y1) ∈ WY and t ∈ [0, 1].

For each positive integer k let Dk and Sk−1 be the closed unit ball in Rk and its boundary.

Proposition 3. Let K be a ﬁnite simplicial complex, let J be a subcomplex, and let g : K → Y

and η : J → X be maps such that f η = g|J . Then there is a continuous extension γ : K → X of

η such that (g(p), f (γ(p))) ∈ WY for all p ∈ K.

3Hatcher [12, Ch. 4] presents an accessible proof of Proposition 2 when X and Y are CW-complexes, and [12,
Prop. A.11] also shows that a space that is dominated by a CW-complex is homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex.

Proof. (The following construction also occurs in [3, p. 436].) Let n be the dimension of K. Let
Vn be a compressive cover such that for all (V ′, V ) ∈ Vn, V × V ⊂ WY . Choose compressive
covers Vn−1, . . . , V0 such that each Vk is a star reﬁnement of Vk+1. In the usual way we let the
vertices of K be the standard unit basis vectors of a Euclidean space, and we let each simplex be

the convex hull of its vertices. The Lebesgue number lemma implies that for each k ≥ 1 there is
εk > 0 such that for any point in K the ball of radius εk around that point is contained in g−1(V )
for some (V ′, V ) ∈ Vk. After suﬃcient repeated barycentric subdivision (e.g., [4]) the mesh of
K is less than min{ε1, . . . , εn}, so we may assume that for each k-simplex σ of K there is some
(V ′, V ) ∈ Vk such that g(σ) ⊂ V .

Let K (k) be the k-skeleton of K. Proceeding inductively, for k = 0, . . . , n we will construct
extensions γk : J ∪ K (k) → X of η such that for each k-simplex σ of K there is some (V ′, V ) ∈ Vk
such that γ(σ) ⊂ f −1(V ). First construct an extension γ0 : J ∪ K (0) → X by letting the image
γ0(v) of a vertex v of K that is not in J be any element of f −1(g(v)). (Of course γ0(v) ∈ f −1(V )
for any (V ′, V ) ∈ V0 such that g(v) ∈ V .)

Now suppose that γk−1 has already been constructed, σ is a k-simplex of K that is not in J,
and τ is a facet of σ. Let ( ˜V ′, ˜V ) be an element of Vk−1 such that g(τ ) ⊂ ˜V . Since every facet of
σ intersects τ and Vk−1 is a star reﬁnement of Vk, there is a (V ′, V ) ∈ Vk such that g(∂σ) ⊂ V ′.
Let ξ : f −1(V ′) × [0, 1] → f −1(V ) be continuous with ξ(·, 0) the identity function of f −1(V ′) and
ξ(·, 1) a constant function. For any homeomorphism h : Dk → σ such that h(Sk−1) = ∂σ, γk−1|∂σ
has an extension γk|σ : σ → f −1(V ) (which is obviously continuous) given by setting

γk|σ(h((1 − t)p)) = ξ(γk−1(h(p), t))

for all p ∈ Sk−1 and t ∈ [0, 1), and letting γk|σ(h(0)) be the constant value of ξ(·, 1). Combining
such extensions for all k-simplices in K that are not in J constructs γk. Finally let γ = γn.

Proof of Theorem 2. For any n ≥ 1 and continuous g : Sn → Y the last result gives a continuous
γ : Sn → X such that (g(p), f (γ(p))) ∈ WY for all p ∈ Sn, so that h(p, t) = sY ((1 − t)g(t) +
tf (γ(p))) is a homotopy between g and f γ. Thus f∗ : πn(X) → πn(Y ) is surjective. If η : Sn → X
is continuous and g : Dn+1 → Y is an extension of f η, then the last result gives a continuous
extension γ : Dn+1 → X of η. Thus f∗ : πn(X) → πn(Y ) is also injective, so Proposition 2 implies
that f is a homotopy equivalence.

3 The Proof of Theorem 1

A convex subset of a topological vector space is contractible (even if the TVS is not locally convex,

because the vector operations are continuous) so C is an element of W0. In view of Lemma 3,

6

once we have shown that D is an ANR, Theorem 2 implies the other assertions of Theorem 1.

The following suﬃcient condition for a space to be an ANR is well known (e.g., [17, Prop. 8.3]).

Lemma 5. If Z is a Hausdorﬀ locally convex topological vector space, K ⊂ Z is convex, U ⊂ K
is (relatively) open, A ⊂ U is metrizable, and r : U → A is a retraction, then A is an ANR4.

Since D is metrizable, the Arens-Eells theorem implies that there is an embedding e : D → N
of D in a normed linear space N such that ˜D = e(D) is closed in N . Let ˜u = e ◦ u|C , and let
˜K be the convex hull of ˜D. Since a metric space is paracompact, the open cover of ˜K \ ˜D whose
elements are the balls (in ˜K) centered at the various ˜x ∈ ˜K \ D of radius one third of the distance
from ˜x to ˜D, has a locally ﬁnite reﬁnement ˜U . For each ˜U ∈ ˜U choose an x ˜U ∈ C such that
the distance from ˜U to ˜u(x ˜U ) is less than twice the distance from ˜U to ˜D. Let {ϕ ˜U } ˜U ∈ ˜U be a
partition of unity subordinate to ˜U , deﬁne ρ : ˜K \ ˜D → ˜D by setting

ρ(z) = ˜u

ϕ ˜U (z)x ˜U (cid:1)

,

(cid:0) X
˜U

and let r : ˜K → ˜D be the function that is the identity on D and ρ on ˜K \ ˜D. Lemma 5 implies that
D and ˜D are ANR’s if r is a retraction, which is evidently the case if it is continuous. Evidently
r is continuous at each point in ˜K \ ˜D. Fixing a point ˜y ∈ ˜D and a neighborhood ˜V ⊂ ˜D, our
goal is to ﬁnd a neighborhood ˜V ′′ ⊂ ˜K of ˜y such that r( ˜V ′′) ⊂ ˜V .

Proposition 1 gives a neighborhood ˜V ′ ⊂ ˜V such that ˜u−1( ˜V ) contains the convex hull of
˜u−1( ˜V ′). Let δ > 0 be small enough that ˜V ′ contains the ball of radius δ (in ˜D) centered at ˜y,
and let ˜V ′′ be the ball of radius δ/6 (in ˜K) centered at ˜y. Fix a point ˜z ∈ ˜V ′′. If ˜z ∈ ˜D, then
r(˜z) = ˜z ∈ ˜V ′′ ∩ ˜D ⊂ ˜V , so assume that ˜z ∈ ˜V ′′ \ ˜D.

Any ˜U ∈ ˜U that contains ˜z is contained in the ball centered at some ˜x ∈ ˜K \ ˜D of radius
α, where α is one third of the distance from ˜x to ˜D. Choose ˜w ∈ ˜U whose distance from ˜u(x ˜U )
is less than twice the distance from ˜U to ˜D, and thus less than 8α. The distance from ˜z to ˜w
is less than 2α, so the distance from ˜y to ˜u(x ˜U ) is less than the distance from ˜y to ˜z plus 10α,
and thus less than 6 times the distance from ˜y to ˜z because the latter quantity is greater than
2α. Therefore ˜u(x ˜U ) ∈ ˜V ′ for all ˜U ∈ ˜U that contain ˜z, so
˜u−1( ˜V ′) and thus ρ(˜z) ∈ ˜V , as desired.

˜U ϕ ˜U (˜z)x ˜U is in the convex hull of

4For the sake of self containment we include the proof. Suppose that X is a metric space, e : A → X maps A
homeomorphically onto e(A), which is closed. A generalization of the Tietze extension theorem due to Dugundji
−1 : e(A) → A has a continuous extension j : X → K. (Dugundji’s proof is a variant of our proof
that D is an ANR, and after reading that the reader may have little diﬃculty constructing his argument.) Then
V = j−1(U ) is a neighborhood of e(A), and e ◦ r ◦ j|V : V → e(A) is a retraction.

4 Relation with the Vietoris-Begle Theorem

We state two versions of the Vietoris-Begle theorem, which use Alexander-Spanier cohomology

and homology respectively. The ﬁrst might be regarded as the “standard” version. It asserts that

if X and Y are paracompact Hausdorﬀ spaces, f : X → Y is a closed continuous surjection, and,
for some n ≥ 0, ˜H k(f −1(y)) = 0 for all y ∈ Y and k < n, then ˜H k(f ) : ˜H k(X) → ˜H k(Y ) is an
isomorphism for k < n and an injection for k = n. A particularly elegant proof is given in [15].

The second version (which we use in the proof of Theorem 3) is a dual result that was established

by Volovikov and Ahn [22] and reproved by Dydak [8]. It asserts that if X and Y are compact
metrizable spaces, f is a continuous surjection, and, for some n ≥ 0, ˜Hk(f −1(y)) = 0 for all y ∈ Y
and k < n, then ˜Hk(f ) : ˜Hk(X) → ˜Hk(Y ) is an isomorphism for k < n and a surjection for k = n.
In each case ˜H ∗(f ) or ˜H∗(f ) is an isomorphism if the ﬁbers are acyclic.

Insofar as each passes from an assumption that the ﬁbers of f are, in some sense, trivial, to

a conclusion that f is or induces an isomorphism, Theorem 2 and the Vietoris-Begle theorem

(including other versions in the literature) are quite similar. In this connection we should also

mention the Main Theorem of [20], which asserts that if X and Y are path connected, locally
compact, separable metric spaces, X is LC n, and for each y ∈ Y , f −1(y) is LC n−1 and (n − 1)-
connected5, then Y is LC n and f∗ : πk(X) → πk(Y ) is an isomorphism for all k < n and a
surjection when k = n.

Theorem 3 further develops the relation between these results. In comparison with Theorem

2, it imposes an hypothesis on the ﬁbers themselves, rather than the preimages of neighborhoods

of points of Y , but the domain must be compact and simply connected.

Theorem 3. If X and Y are compact connected ANR’s, X is simply connected, f : X → Y
is a continuous surjection, and, for each y ∈ Y , f −1(y) is contractible, then f is a homotopy

equivalence.

We need a technical result that is a variant of [19, Lemma 1] and [20, Lemma 1].

Lemma 6. If A is a compact space, B is a Hausdorﬀ space, g : A → B is a map, b ∈ B, and
U ⊂ A is an open neighborhood of g−1(b), then there is an open V ⊂ B containing b such that
g−1(V ) ⊂ U .

Proof. Otherwise for each open V ⊂ B containing b there would be an aV ∈ A \ U such that

g(aV ) ∈ V . Since A \ U is compact, a subnet of {aV } would converge to one of its elements, say

5A path connected space X is: (a) n-connected if, for every 1 ≤ k ≤ n, every map Sk → X has a continuous
extension Dk+1 → X; (b) LC n if, for every x ∈ X and neighborhood U ⊂ X, there is a neighborhood V ⊂ U of x
such that for each 1 ≤ k ≤ n, every map Sk → V has a continuous extension Dk+1 → U .

8

a. Since B is Hausdorﬀ, continuity gives g(a) = b, but then a ∈ g−1(b) ∩ (A \ U ) = ∅.

As before we assume that X and Y are isometrically embedded in normed linear spaces NX and

NY , we ﬁx retractions retractions rX : UX → X and sY : VY → Y of neighborhoods UX ⊂ NX and

VY ⊂ NY of X and Y , and we let W ⊂ Y × Y be a neighborhood of the diagonal { (y, y) : y ∈ Y }

such that (1 − t)y0 + ty1 ∈ VY for all (y0, y1) ∈ W and t ∈ [0, 1].

Lemma 7. If y ∈ Y and f −1(y) is path connected, then, for any open V ⊂ Y containing y, there
is an open V ′ ⊂ V containing y such that any function η∂ : {−1, 1} → f −1(V ′) has a continuous
extension η : [−1, 1] → f −1(V ).

Proof. Since f −1(y) is compact there is a δ > 0 such that the open δ-ball Bδ in NX around
f −1(y) is contained in r−1
X (f −1(V )). Lemma 6 gives an open V ′ ⊂ V containing y such that
f −1(V ′) ⊂ Bδ. Suppose η∂ is a function from {−1, 1} to f −1(V ′). Choose x−1, x1 ∈ f −1(y) such
that the distance from η∂(−1) to x−1 and the distance from η∂(1) to x1 are both less than δ. A
satisfactory extension η can be constructed by combining reparameterizations of the three paths
t 7→ rX((1 − t)η∂(−1) + tx−1), a path π : [0, 1] → f −1(y) with π(−1) = x−1 and π(1) = x1, and
the path t 7→ rX((1 − t)x1 + tη∂(1)).

Fix a point x0 ∈ X, and let y0 = f (x0). Let ˜X and ˜Y be the universal covering spaces of X
and Y , with respect to the base points x0 and y0, and let ˜f : ˜X → ˜Y be the lift of f with respect
to these base points. The proof of Theorem 3 veriﬁes the hypotheses of the following variant of

Proposition 2, which is Theorem 3 of [24].

Proposition 4. If X and Y are connected elements of W0, a map f : X → Y is a homotopy
equivalence if and only if f∗ : π1(X) → π1(Y ) is an isomorphism and ˜Hn( ˜f ) : ˜Hn( ˜X) → ˜Hn( ˜Y ) is
an isomorphism for each n = 2, 3, . . ..

Proof of Theorem 3. Lemma 7 implies that there is an open cover { V ′ : (V ′, V ) ∈ V} of Y where V
is a collection of pairs (V ′, V ) such that V and V ′ are open subsets of Y , V × V ⊂ W , V ′ ⊂ V , and
any function η∂ : {−1, 1} → f −1(V ′) has a continuous extension η : [−1, 1] → f −1(V ). Consider
a continuous g : S1 → Y . After suﬃcient subdivision S1 is a simplicial complex, each of whose
1-simplices σ satisﬁes g(∂σ) ⊂ V ′ for some (V ′, V ) ∈ V. For each vertex v of this complex choose
γ0(v) ∈ f −1(g(v)). As in the proof of Proposition 3, there is an extension γ1 : S1 → X of γ0 such
that (g(p), f (γ(p))) ∈ W for all p ∈ S1, so that h(p, t) = sY ((1 − t)g(t) + tf (γ(p))) is a homotopy
between g and f γ. Thus f∗ : π1(X) → π1(Y ) is surjective.

Since X is simply connected, it follows that Y is simply connected, so f∗ : π1(X) → π1(Y )
is an isomorphism and ˜X, ˜Y , and ˜f are (up to irrelevant formalities) just X, Y , and f . As

we mentioned previously, since each ﬁbre f −1(y) is contractible, it is acyclic, and ˜X = X is
compact, so the dual Vietoris-Begle theorem of Volovikov-Ahn and Dydak implies that ˜Hn( ˜f ) is
an isomorphism for all n ≥ 2, after which Proposition 4 implies that f is a homotopy equivalence.

(The dual Vietoris-Begle theorem is speciﬁc to Alexander-Spanier homology, and Whitehead uses

it is well known that Alexander-Spanier homology agrees with
singular homology. However,
ˇCech homology on compact Hausdorﬀ spaces, and ˇCech and singular homology agree on ANR’s
[6, 14, 16].)

The assumptions of Theorem 3 imply those of Theorem 2 if each ﬁber is an AR.

Lemma 8. If X is a locally compact metric space, f : X → Y is a surjective map, V ⊂ Y is
open, y ∈ V , and f −1(y) is a compact AR, then there is an open V ′ ⊂ V containing y such that
(V ′, V ) is a compressive pair.

Proof. We can replace V with a smaller neighborhood of y, so we may assume that V × V ⊂ W .
Fix a contraction c : f −1(y) × [0, 1] → f −1(y) and a retraction r : U → f −1(y) where U ⊂ X is a
neighborhood of f −1(y). Since f −1(y) is compact,

U ′ = { x ∈ U : (1 − t)x + tr(x) ∈ r−1

X (f −1(V )) for all t ∈ [0, 1] }

is an open neighborhood of f −1(y). Lemma 6, applied to a compact neighborhood of f −1(y)
contained in U ′, implies that there is an open V ′ ⊂ V containing y such that f −1(V ′) ⊂ U ′. Let
ξ : f −1(V ′) × [0, 1] → f −1(V ) be the function

ξ(x, t) = 




rX ((1 − 2t)x + 2tr(x)),

c(r(x), 2t − 1),

0 ≤ t ≤ 1
2 ,

1
2 ≤ t ≤ 1.

We conclude with an example of a map f satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 3, but with

one ﬁber that is not an AR, so that Lemma 8 cannot be used to verify the hypotheses of Theorem

2. Kinoshita [13] (see also [17, 8.1]) created an example that came to be known as the tin can
with a roll of toilet paper. This is the space T = (D × {0}) ∪ (C × [0, 1]) ∪ (S × [0, 1]) ⊂ R3 where:

D = { x ∈ R2 : kxk ≤ 1 }, C = { x ∈ R2 : kxk = 1 }, S = { θ

1+θ (cos θ, sin θ) : 0 ≤ θ < ∞ }.

There is an obvious contraction of T that deformation retracts vertically onto D × {0}, then

compresses that set. Kinoshita gave a continuous function from T to itself that does not have a

ﬁxed point, so, in view of the Eilenberg-Montgomery ﬁxed point theorem, T cannot be an AR.

Let S2 = { z ∈ R3 : kzk = 1 }. It is easy to see6 that there is a homeomorphism h : S2 ×
(0, ∞) → R3 \ T such that T =
Tε>0 h(S2 × (0, ε)). For x ∈ R3 \ T let h−1(x) = (p(x), α(x)). Let
X ⊂ R3 be a compact ball centered at the origin that contains T , let f : X → R3 be the function
that maps each x ∈ T to the origin and maps each x /∈ T to α(x)p(x), and let Y = f (X). Clearly

f : X → Y satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 3 but not those of Lemma 8.

6Here is an explicit construction. Let L be a line in R2 that passes through the origin, and let CL = (L × R) ∩ S2.
For ε > 0 let DL.ε = PL,ε ∪ QL,ε ∪ RL,ε where PL,ε = { x ∈ L : kxk ≤ 1 + ε } × {−ε}, QL,ε = { x ∈ L : kxk =

1+ε }×[−ε, 1+ε], and RL,ε is the union of { x ∈ L : 1 ≤ kxk ≤ 1+ε }×{1+ε}, the singleton {(0, 0, 1+ε)}, and for each

pair of consecutive points x0, x1 ∈ L∩S the set { ((1−t)x0 +tx1, max{1+ε−min{t, 1−t}kx1 −x0k/ε, ε}) : t ∈ [0, 1] }.

It is easy to construct maps hL,ε : CL × {ε} → DL,ε that combine to give a satisfactory h.
