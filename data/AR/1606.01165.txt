ABSTRACT

The hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) is rich in metals, which are synthesised by supernovae (SNe) explosions and accumulate over
time into the deep gravitational potential well of clusters of galaxies. Since most of the elements visible in X-rays are formed by type
Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae, measuring their abundances gives us direct information on the nucleosynthesis
products of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star formation peak (z ∼ 2–3). In this study, we use the EPIC and RGS instruments
on board XMM-Newton to measure the abundances of nine elements (O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni) from a sample of 44
nearby cool-core galaxy clusters, groups, and elliptical galaxies. We ﬁnd that the Fe abundance shows a large scatter (∼20–40%) over
the sample, within 0.2r500 and especially 0.05r500. Unlike the absolute Fe abundance, the abundance ratios (X/Fe) are uniform over
the considered temperature range (∼0.6–8 keV) and with a limited scatter. In addition to an unprecedented treatment of systematic
uncertainties, we provide the most accurate abundance ratios measured so far in the ICM, including Cr/Fe and Mn/Fe which we ﬁrmly
detected (>4σ with MOS and pn independently). We ﬁnd that Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the proto-solar values.
However, the large uncertainties in the proto-solar abundances prevent us from making a robust comparison between the local and the
intra-cluster chemical enrichments. We also note that, interestingly, and despite the large net exposure time (∼4.5 Ms) of our dataset,
no line emission feature is seen around ∼3.5 keV.

1. Introduction

About 80–90% of the baryonic matter in the Universe is in the
form of a hot and diﬀuse intergalactic gas, which has mostly a
very low density and, therefore, is hard to observe. However, in
the largest gravitationally bound regions of the Universe, which
are clusters of galaxies, the density and temperature of this hot
gas, or intra-cluster medium (ICM), becomes high enough for it
to glow in X-rays. This ICM, which has been extensively studied
by X-ray observatories over the past decades (for a review, see
Böhringer & Werner 2010), is particularly rich in metals (e.g.
Mitchell et al. 1976; Mushotzky et al. 1996). Since the bary-
onic content of the Universe just after the Big Bang consists ex-
clusively of hydrogen and helium (and traces of lithium), these
heavy elements – typically from oxygen to nickel – must have
been synthesised by stars and supernovae (SNe) in the galaxy
members and then ejected into the ICM (for a review, see Werner
et al. 2008; de Plaa 2013).

Although the general picture of this chemical enrichment is
now well established, many aspects are still poorly understood.
In addition to the question of the transport mechanisms that
drive the enrichment, a major uncertainty resides in the metal
yields produced by type Ia (SNIa) and core-collapse (SNcc) su-
pernovae. In fact, the nature of the SNIa progenitors and the

SNIa explosion mechanisms are still under debate, while the
global nucleosynthesis of SNcc highly depends on the initial
mass function (IMF) and the initial metallicity of the consid-
ered stellar population. Moreover, in addition to SNe, AGB stars
can also play a role in releasing lighter metals (e.g. nitrogen)
or even heavy metals (via the s-process). Taken together, these
unsolved questions lead to large uncertainties in predicting the
global abundance ratios that are ﬁnally released by the SNe and
AGB stars into the ICM.

In contrast to the remaining uncertainties in the theoretical
yields from the SNe/AGB models, the current generation of X-
ray observatories measures the chemical abundances in the ICM
with remarkable accuracy since most transitions of H- and He-
like elements from Z=7 to Z=28 fall within 0.2–12 keV. Thanks
to the large eﬀective area and the good spectral resolution of its
European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC, Strüder et al. 2001;
Turner et al. 2001) and Reﬂection Grating Spectrometer (RGS,
den Herder et al. 2001), XMM-Newton is particularly suitable
for measuring abundances of elements like oxygen (O), neon
(Ne), magnesium (Mg), silicon (S), sulfur (S), argon (Ar), cal-
cium (Ca), iron (Fe), and nickel (Ni), especially in cool-core ob-

jects1 which exhibit a high surface brightness in X-ray and where
the most prominent K-shell emission lines of these elements are
clearly detected. Consequently, the accuracy of these measure-
ments can, in principle, bring new constraints on the SNe (and
AGB) models, and can lead to a deeper understanding of the
chemical enrichment processes beyond galactic scales.

Several authors have reported such analyses by measuring
the abundances in the ICM of nearby clusters and groups. For
instance, de Plaa et al. (2007) has compiled a sample of 22
cool-core clusters and found that the standard SNIa models fail
to reproduce the Ar/Ca and Ca/Fe abundance ratios. They also
show that the number of SNIa over the total number of SNe
highly depends on the considered models. De Grandi & Molendi
(2009) have shown that Si/Fe abundance ratios are remarkably
uniform over a sample of 26 cool-core clusters observed with
XMM-Newton, arguing for a similar enrichment process within
cluster cores. However they suggest that systematic uncertain-
ties are too large to precisely estimate the relative contribution
of SNIa and SNcc. Finally, many abundance studies have also
been performed on individual objects (e.g. Werner et al. 2006;
de Plaa et al. 2006; Sato et al. 2007a; Simionescu et al. 2009;
Mernier et al. 2015). From these studies, and considering the ac-
tual instrumental performances of current X-ray observatories, it
appears that higher quality data (i.e. with longer exposure time)
spread over larger samples are needed to clarify the actual pic-
ture of the precise origin of metals in the ICM.

In this work (hereafter Paper I), we use new and archival
XMM-Newton EPIC observations to measure the chemical abun-
dances of nine elements (O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni) in
the core of a sample of nearby cool-core galaxy clusters, groups,
and elliptical galaxies. These EPIC observations are then com-
bined with the RGS abundance measurements adapted from de
Plaa et al. (to be submitted) in order to derive average X/Fe abun-
dance ratios representative of the nearby ICM. Taking into ac-
count as many systematic uncertainties as possible, we discuss
the robustness of these measurements and compare them to the
proto-solar abundances. In a second paper (Mernier et al. 2016,
hereafter Paper II), we discuss in detail the astrophysical impli-
cations of our results, and compare our average abundance pat-
tern presented here with predictions from theoretical SNIa and
SNcc yield models.

This paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the
sample and the data reduction pipeline. In Sect. 3 we describe
the spectral analysis procedure applied to our EPIC observations.
Our results are presented in Sect. 4, brieﬂy discussed in Sect. 5,
and summarised in Sect. 6. Throughout this paper we assume
cosmological parameters of H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.3,
and ΩΛ = 0.7. All the error bars are given at a 68% conﬁdence
level.

2. Observations and data preparation

Our sample consists of the CHEERS2 catalogue (de Plaa et al.,
to be submitted), and is detailed in Table 1 (see also Pinto et al.
2015, and de Plaa et al., to be submitted). It includes 44 nearby
(z < 0.1) cool-core clusters, groups, and elliptical galaxies for
which the O viii 1s–2p line at 19 Å is detected by the RGS instru-
ment with >5σ. More information on the intrinsic properties of
these objects (e.g. ﬂuxes) can be found in various available clus-

ter catalogues, such as the HIGFLUGCS (Reiprich & Böhringer
2002), the REFLEX (Böhringer et al. 2004), and the ACCEPT
(Cavagnolo et al. 2009) catalogues. In our sample, recent XMM-
Newton observations (AO-12, PI: de Plaa) have been combined
with archival data. We only select the pointings for which the
combined EPIC observations (MOS 1, MOS 2, and pn) gather
at least 15 ks of net exposure time. The observations that suf-
fer from high soft ﬂare events or calibration problems are also
excluded.

2.1. Data reduction

All the data are reduced with the XMM-Newton Science Anal-
ysis System (SAS) v14.0.0 and by using the calibration ﬁles
dated by March 2015. The RGS data are the same as used
in Pinto et al. (2015, see their Table 1), and are reduced the
same way. We reduce the EPIC data by using the standard
pipeline command emproc and epproc, and, following the stan-
dard recommendations, we keep the single to quadruple pixel
MOS events (PATTERN≤12), and only the single pixel pn events
(PATTERN==0). Moreover, only the highest quality MOS and
pn events (FLAG==0) are taken into account. We ﬁlter our ob-
servations from soft-proton ﬂares by building good time inter-
val (GTI) ﬁles following the method described in Mernier et al.
(2015). We extract light curves within the 10–12 keV (MOS)
and the 12–14 keV (pn) bands in 100 s bins, we calculate the
mean count rate µ and the standard deviation σ, and we apply a
threshold of µ ± 2σ to the ﬁtted distribution. For safety (Lumb
et al. 2002), we repeat the procedure for the 0.3–10 keV band
in 10 s bins. The average fraction of “good” time accepted after
such a ﬁltering is ∼77%, ∼78%, and ∼66% for MOS 1, MOS 2,
and pn, respectively, although this fraction varies widely from
pointing to pointing. For each object, the net exposure times of
the EPIC instruments are indicated in Table 1. Combining our
whole dataset, we obtain total EPIC and RGS net exposure times
of ∼4.5 Ms and ∼5.1 Ms, respectively.

Finally, point-like sources might pollute our spectra; there-
fore, we need to discard all of them from the rest of our analy-
sis. We ﬁrst detect the point sources of every dataset within four
spectral bands (0.3–2 keV, 2–4.5 keV, 4.5–7.5 keV, and 7.5–12
keV) using the SAS task edetect_chain. After a second check
by eye, we excise circular regions with 10(cid:48)(cid:48) of radius around
the point sources (except in some speciﬁc situations where a
larger excision radius is required to remove scattered photons
from bright foreground sources). This radius size is estimated to
be a good compromise between discarding the polluting ﬂux of
the point sources and keeping a maximum of cluster emission
in their neighbourhood (Mernier et al. 2015). Depending on the
target, the typical fraction of removed ﬂux after discarding the
point sources varies between ∼0.3% and ∼4%.

2.2. Spectra extraction

The sources of our sample span a wide range of sizes, masses,
and temperatures, and studying their elemental abundances with
EPIC over one common astrophysical scale rcore is diﬃcult in
3 for the farther (and, by
practice. A deﬁnition of rcore as 0.2r500
selection, hotter) clusters is commonly found in the literature
(e.g. de Plaa et al. 2007); however, most of the nearest galaxy
groups from our sample are seen at this radius with an angular
size θ > 15 arcmin, i.e. beyond the EPIC ﬁeld of view (FoV).

3 r500 is deﬁned as the radius within which the gas density is 500 times
the critical density of the Universe.

The letter h stands for the “hot” clusters (>1.7 keV), while the letter c stands for the “cool” groups/ellipticals (<1.7 keV). M 87 is
an exception, and is classiﬁed as cool even though its central temperature is about ∼2 keV (see text).

Moreover, extracting spectra over a large θ for these cooler and
more compact objects will include a lot of background, which
may dominate beyond ∼2–3 keV and entirely ﬂood the K-shell

lines of crucial elements such as S, Ar, Ca, or Ni. Therefore, we
choose to split our sample into two subsamples:

1. The “hot” galaxy clusters (kT ≥ 1.7 keV, 23 objects),

Article number, page 3 of 17

A&A proofs: manuscript no. Core_abundances-I_hk

2. The “cool” galaxy groups and ellipticals (kT < 1.7 keV, 21

objects).

Using the SAS task evselect, we extract the EPIC spectra of
every source within a circular region, centred on the peak of the
cluster X-ray emission and within a radius of 0.05r500. Since in
the hot clusters a radius of 0.2r500 can also be reached and pro-
vides better signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we extract these spectra
as well.

Table 1 classiﬁes each object in one of these two subsamples.
Only M 87 deviates from the rule. Indeed, although its main cen-
tral temperature is about ∼2 keV (and is thus considered a hot
object), its 0.2r500 limit is beyond the EPIC FoV, and only the
spectra within 0.05r500 could be extracted.

We extract the RGS spectra as described in Pinto et al. (2015)
and in de Plaa et al. (to be submitted). Since the dispersion di-
rection of RGS extends along the whole EPIC FoV, its extraction
region will be always diﬀerent from our circular EPIC extraction
regions. Therefore, we extract all the RGS spectra using a cross-
dispersion width of 0.8(cid:48) from the EPIC FoV, which still focuses
on the ICM core. In Sect. 4.3 we show that this choice does not
aﬀect our results.

The redistribution matrix ﬁle (RMF), which gives the chan-
nel probability distribution for a photon of given energy, is built
using the task rmfgen. The ancillary response ﬁle (ARF), which
provides the eﬀective area curve as a function of the energy and
the position on the detectors, is built using the task arfgen. Both
the RMF and the ARF contain all the information relative to the
response of the instruments, and need to be further applied for
each observation to the spectral modelling4.

3. EPIC spectral analysis

We use the SPEX ﬁtting package (Kaastra et al. 1996) v2.05 to
perform the spectral analysis of our sample. We ﬁt all our spectra
using the C-statistics (i.e. a modiﬁed Cash statistics; Cash 1979),
which is appropriate for Poisson-noise dominated data (see the
SPEX manual).

Making the reasonable assumption that the hot ICM is in a
collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) state, throughout this pa-
per we describe its emission using a cie model (based on an
updated version of the MEKAL plasma code, Mewe et al. 1985).
This model includes processes such as collisional ionisation and
excitation-autoionisation, as well as radiative and dielectronic
recombination (for further details, we refer the reader to the
SPEX manual5). We adopt the updated ionisation balance cal-
culations of Bryans et al. (2009). The abundances are calculated
from all the transitions and ions of a given element, and are
scaled to the proto-solar values6 of Lodders et al. (2009).

We ﬁt the cluster emission component in EPIC with a
multi-temperature cie model, the Gaussian Diﬀerential Emis-
sion Measure (gdem) model, which reproduces a Gaussian tem-
perature distribution in the form

where x = log(kT ) and xmean = log(kTmean), kTmean is the peak

maximum of the distribution (see de Plaa et al. 2006). By deﬁni-
tion, σT =0 provides a single-temperature cie model (1T).

The use of a multi-temperature model for such a study is
crucial since most of the clusters and groups have a complicated
thermal structure in their cores where the cooling rate and tem-
perature gradient are quite important. Therefore, assuming the
plasma to be isothermal in general may lead to the so-called Fe
bias, i.e. an underestimate of the Fe abundance (see e.g. Buote &
Canizares 1994; Buote & Fabian 1998; Buote 2000). The eﬀects
of diﬀerent thermal models on the abundances and a compari-
son between EPIC and RGS measurements are discussed below
(Sect. 4.3).

For both EPIC and RGS abundances, we also correct the O
and Ne estimates from updated calculations of the radiative re-
combination contribution to the cluster emission as a function
of its mean temperature. We do so by multiplying the O and Ne
best-ﬁt measurements of each object by the factors of the cor-
rected O viii and Ne x Lyman α ﬂuxes, as described in Appendix
B. On average, these corrections increase the O and Ne abun-
dances by ∼20% and ∼6%, respectively.

The Galactic absorption that we apply to our ﬁtted thermal
models is modelled by the transmission of a neutral plasma (hot
model, for which kT =0.5 eV). In EPIC, the hydrogen column
density NH has been estimated from a grid search of (ﬁxed) val-
ues within

NH i − 5 × 1019 cm−2 ≤ NH ≤ NH,tot + 1 × 1020 cm−2,

(2)

where NH i and NH,tot are respectively the neutral (Kalberla et al.
2005) and total (neutral and molecular) hydrogen column densi-
ties estimated using the method of Willingale et al. (2013). More
details on the reasons for this approach are given in Appendix A.
Details on the RGS spectral analysis (including models, free
parameters, and background treatment) can be found in de Plaa
et al. (to be submitted), and in Pinto et al. (2015).

3.1. Background modelling

Although the clusters considered in this work are usually bright
and display a high S/N within their core, in most of them the
EPIC background can still play a signiﬁcant role, especially in
the hard spectral bands (i.e. >∼2 keV) where less thermal emission
is expected. Because a slightly incorrect scaling in the subtrac-
tion of background data (taken from either ﬁlter closed wheel
data or blank sky observations) can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the tem-
perature estimates and thus bias the spectral analyses (de Plaa
et al. 2006), we choose here to model the background directly
in our spectra. The method we use is extensively described in
Mernier et al. (2015). In summary, we model ﬁve separate back-
ground components:

– the local hot bubble, modelled by a non-absorbed isothermal
cie component, whose abundances are kept proto-solar;
– the galactic thermal emission, modelled by an absorbed
isothermal cie component, whose abundances are also kept
proto-solar;

– the unresolved point sources, modelled by an absorbed
power law with a photon index ﬁxed to 1.41 (De Luca &
Molendi 2004);

– the hard particle background, modelled by a broken power
law (unfolded by the eﬀective area) and several instrumental
Gaussian proﬁles. The parameters are taken from Mernier
et al. (2015), except for all the normalisations, which are left
free;

F. Mernier et al.: Origin of central abundances in the hot intra-cluster medium

– the soft-proton background, modelled by a power law (un-
folded by the eﬀective area). The parameters are estimated
using EPIC spectra covering the total FoV (where the param-
eters of the gdem component from the ICM are also left free;
see Sect. 3.2). From such spectra, the ICM emission can be
easily constrained in the soft band (<∼2 keV), while the parti-
cle backgrounds clearly dominate the harder bands, making
the soft-proton background contribution easier to estimate.

The ﬂuxes and the temperatures of the local hot bubble and
galactic thermal emission components, as well as the ﬂux of
the unresolved point sources, are estimated from ROSAT PSPC
spectra extracted from the region beyond r200 of each object
(Zhang et al. 2009).

Finally, all these background components are ﬁxed and
rescaled to the sky area of our EPIC core spectra (except the nor-
malisation of the hard particle background, which we always left
free in order to avoid incorrect scalings and temperature biases,
see above).

In addition to the background described above, M 87, M 89,
NGC 4261, NGC 4636, and NGC 5813 host a powerful active
galactic nucleus (AGN), which can generate cavities in the hot
gas (e.g. Russell et al. 2013), but can also pollute the total X-ray
emission. For each of these observations, we start by extracting
a circular region of 30(cid:48)(cid:48) centred on the AGN, and we ﬁt its EPIC
spectra with an absorbed power law (in addition to the clus-
ter emission and the background components described above).
We then extrapolate this additional component to the EPIC core
spectra, ﬁxing its column density and photon index values de-
rived from the 30(cid:48)(cid:48) aperture region, and rescaling its normalisa-
tion to the area ratio of these two extracted regions. We note that
in the EPIC core spectra the 0.5–10 keV ﬂux of the AGN compo-
nent is never larger than ∼15–20% of the cluster emission. This
justiﬁes a posteriori our choice of ﬁtting the AGN contribution
rather than excising the AGN, i.e. where the peak of the cluster
emission is.

3.2. Global ﬁts

In addition to the normalisation of the hard particle background,
the only parameters that are left free when ﬁtting our spectral
components to the EPIC spectra of the core regions are the nor-
malisation (or emission measure, Y = (cid:82)
nenHdV) of the gdem
model; its mean temperature (kTmean); σT ; and the abundances
of O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni. The other Z ≥ 6 abun-
dance parameters are coupled to the value of the Fe abundance
parameter, and are thus not free. The MOS and pn spectra of
every pointing are ﬁtted simultaneously. Since the large num-
ber of total parameters prevents us from ﬁtting simultaneously
three observations or more, for each object we form pairs of two
pointings that we ﬁt simultaneously. For objects including ≥3
pointings, we then combine the results of the ﬁtted pairs using a
weighting factor of 1/σ2
i , where σi is the statistical error on the
considered parameter.

An important variable that might aﬀect our EPIC results is
the spectral ranges of our ﬁts. In particular, signiﬁcant cross-
calibration issues between MOS and pn have been reported in
the soft bands (Read et al. 2014; Schellenberger et al. 2015).
Similarly, we observe a sharp and extremely variable soft tail
in the EPIC ﬁlter wheel closed events7 that might considerably
aﬀect the spectra below 0.5 keV. On the other hand, we would

7 See also the XMM-Newton Calibration Technical Note, XMM-SOC-
CAL-TN-0018 (Ed: Guainazzi, 2014).

like to keep our spectral range as large as possible, for instance to
estimate the abundance measurements of O and the temperature
structure in the Fe-L complex. A good compromise is found by
using the 0.5–10 keV and 0.6–10 keV bands for MOS and pn,
respectively.

3.3. Local ﬁts

In the case of a plasma in CIE, the abundances of a given el-
ement showing prominent and well-resolved emission lines are
easy to derive as they are proportional to the ratio between the
line ﬂux and the continuum ﬂux, namely the equivalent width
(EW). However, as a consequence of the imperfections of the
EPIC instruments eﬀective areas, when ﬁtting the EPIC spectra
over a large range (0.5/0.6–10 keV in the previous subsection,
hereafter the “global” ﬁts), the modelled continuum emission
may be slightly over- or underestimated in some speciﬁc energy
bands. Consequently, the modelled line ﬂuxes tend to compen-
sate the continuum discrepancies in the global ﬁts, by, in turn,
slightly under- or overestimating the value of the abundance pa-
rameters.

This eﬀect, already discussed in Mernier et al. (2015), can
be easily corrected by ﬁtting the EPIC spectra locally, in or-
der to allow the modelled continuum to be ﬁtted to its correct
(local) level. Therefore, we re-ﬁt the EPIC spectra within local
bands successively centred around the strongest K-shell lines of
each element (except Ne, whose strongest lines reside in the Fe-
L complex and are not resolved by the EPIC instruments). The
temperature parameters kTmean and σT are frozen to their EPIC
global best-ﬁt values, in such a way that in every local ﬁt, the free
parameters are only the (local) normalisation Y and the abun-
dance of the considered element. We compare these abundances
estimated locally in MOS (MOS 1 and MOS 2 are ﬁtted simulta-
neously) and in pn individually. If the MOS and pn abundances
agree within 1σ, we combine the measurements using a weight-
ing factor of 1/σ2
i (see also Sect. 3.2). Otherwise, we compute
the weighted average and artiﬁcially increase the combined un-
certainties until they fully cover the extreme MOS and pn 1σ
values. By applying such a conservative method to each object,
we cover individual systematic uncertainties related to the EPIC
cross-calibration issues (see also Sect. 4.3), and ensure getting
fully reliable abundance measurements.

Hereafter, all the EPIC abundances are locally corrected, un-
less otherwise stated. We note, however, that the EPIC Fe abun-
dances reported in this paper are obtained using global ﬁts be-
cause they are more accurately determined using both the Fe-
K and Fe-L complexes. Except A 3526 (for which we estimate
Fe using local ﬁts), all the other objects show (<2σ) consistent
EPIC Fe abundances when using successively local and global
ﬁts, so this choice does not aﬀect our results.

4. Results

The ﬁnal abundance estimates for EPIC (within 0.2r500 and
0.05r500) and RGS of all the objects in the sample are presented
in Fig. 1 (Fe abundance) and Fig. 2 (other relative-to-Fe abun-
dance ratios), spread over their EPIC mean temperatures.

As can be seen in Fig. 1, some sources show a signiﬁcant
discrepancy between their EPIC and RGS measured Fe abun-
dances. This is not surprising, since the RGS extraction regions
always have the same angular size (∼30(cid:48)×0.8(cid:48)), while the radius
of the circular EPIC extraction regions is diﬀerent for each object
(Sect. 2.2). Moreover, owing to its poorly constrained continuum

level and its limited spectral range (in particular with no access
to the Fe-K lines), RGS is not very suitable for deriving absolute
Fe abundances. In the case of very extended sources, the instru-

mental line broadening makes Fe even more diﬃcult to derive
with RGS, leading to larger uncertainties. Nevertheless, the rel-
ative abundance ratios O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe measured with

RGS do not depend on the continuum and are easier to constrain
(Sect. 4.1).

√

(cid:113)

Within 0.2r500 (red triangles), the Fe abundance of the hot
clusters are somewhat dispersed, with a mean value of 0.71.
Within 0.05r500 (black squares), the mean Fe abundance in the
cool groups/ellipticals is 0.64, while in the hot clusters it is 0.78
(see also Fig. 3). We estimate the intrinsic scatter in our subsam-
ples, and its upper and lower 1σ limits by following the method
described in de Plaa et al. (2007). Knowing the statistical errors

int that have χ2 = k ±

the number of degrees of freedom). For the hot clusters we ﬁnd
an intrinsic scatter of (21 ± 4)% within 0.2r500, and (33 ± 7)%
within 0.05r500. The intrinsic scatter in the cool groups (0.05r500)
is (31 ± 5)%, which is comparable to the value found in hot clus-
ters within the same core radius. Finally, we note an interesting
trend regarding the pair of measurements (0.05r500,0.2r500) for
each hot cluster (blue dotted lines). When the cluster mean tem-
perature increases, the temperature gradient seems to increase,
while on the contrary, the Fe gradient seems to ﬂatten.

All the abundance ratios shown in Fig. 2 are consistent with
being uniform over the considered temperatures range, even
when considering the two diﬀerent EPIC extraction regions. This
is particularly striking for Si/Fe (although a slightly decreasing
trend cannot be excluded) and S/Fe. This trend is investigated
more quantitatively in Sect. 4.3 where we compare the average
abundance ratios of the hot and the cool objects. Moreover, we
note that both EPIC and RGS measurements are consistent; the
exception is Ne/Fe, for which the RGS measurements remain
uniform while the EPIC values suggest a decrease with tempera-
ture (see discussion in Sect. 4.1, and a further inspection in Sect.
4.3). Finally, although their uncertainties are large and deriving
any trend is very diﬃcult, we note that the Ni/Fe abundance ra-
tios are all consistent with being larger than the proto-solar value.

4.1. Estimating reliable average abundances

Assuming that all these relative-to-Fe abundance ratios are in-
deed uniform over clusters and do not depend (much) on their
histories, we can combine our individual measurements and es-
timate for each element one average abundance ratio represen-
tative of the nearby cool-core ICM as a whole. We estimate the
average relative-to-Fe abundance of a given element “X” by us-
ing the weighting factors 1/σ(X/Fe)2
i , where σ(X/Fe)i is the un-
certainty on the X/Fe abundance in the ith observation. In the
case of asymmetric X/Fe uncertainties in some observations, we
systematically choose the larger one (in absolute value).

In addition to studying the subsamples of the hot clusters
(within either 0.2r500 or 0.05r500), we can also combine the
hot subsample (within 0.2r500) with the cool subsample (within
0.05r500), in order to get a “full” sample, named hereafter (0.05+
0.2)r500, which contains the highest statistics. A complete com-
parison of this full sample with the three subsamples mentioned
above is discussed in Sect. 4.3.

As mentioned earlier, RGS measures the absolute Fe abun-
dance with a high degree of uncertainty. However, it is quite re-
liable in measuring the abundance ratios of O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and
sometimes Mg/Fe (assuming a low redshift and a high S/N,
which is the case for our sample). Unlike RGS, EPIC is not very
suitable for measuring O/Fe abundance ratios (whose main emis-
sion lines reside at ∼0.6 keV near the O absorption edge and
where the calibration is somewhat uncertain) and Ne/Fe abun-

dance ratios (whose K-shell transitions are within the Fe-L com-
plex, which depends on the temperature structure and is not re-
solved by the EPIC instruments), but can in principle make re-
liable measurements of all the other considered ones. Moreover,
EPIC observes both the Fe-L and Fe-K complexes, as well as
the continuum emission, and thus provides more trustworthy ab-
solute Fe abundances and temperatures. We note that we ﬁnd
large positive residuals around 1.2 keV in the EPIC spectra of
NGC 5813 and NGC 5846, which prevents us from estimating
reasonable Mg abundances, even by performing local ﬁts. For
these two groups, the Mg/Fe ratios inferred from RGS are un-
doubtedly more reliable.

Taking these instrumental characteristics into account, in the
following we use the O/Fe and Ne/Fe abundances from RGS. We
use EPIC for the Mg/Fe (except in NGC 5813 and NGC 5846),
Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Fe, and Ni/Fe abundances. We discuss
more extensively the robustness of this choice in Sect. 4.3. Ta-
ble D.1 shows the best estimated temperature and selected abun-
dance measurements for all the objects in our samples. The av-
erage abundance ratios and their statistical uncertainties σstat are
indicated in the second and third columns of Table 2. We note
again that O/Fe and Ne/Fe have been corrected from updated ra-
diative recombination calculations (Appendix B).

4.2. EPIC stacked residuals

The large net exposure time allows us to stack the residuals of
the previously ﬁtted global EPIC spectra. The residuals of each
observation are obtained after ﬁtting the three instruments simul-
taneously for each pointing (Sect. 3.2), and are corrected from
their respective redshift before the stacking process. The residu-
als are summed over observations following

to stack the results. This weight, which depends on both the ob-
servation and the spectral bin considered, is the product of two

values: the inverse square of the statistical error of data(k)i and a
factor, between 0 and 1, corresponding to the overlapping frac-
tion between a bin from a reference spectrum, and a bin from
a spectrum to be stacked to the reference one (e.g. if the “ref-
erence spectrum” and “stacking spectrum” bins do not overlap,
the overlapping fraction is 0, if they fully overlap, the fraction
is 1; see also Leccardi & Molendi 2008). This second factor is
necessary because the spectra (or spectral residuals) from diﬀer-
ent observations have diﬀerent oﬀsets in their rest frame binning
owing to their diﬀerent redshift corrections. Figure 4 (top three
panels) shows the stacked MOS 1, MOS 2, and pn residuals.

Although the deviations are not larger than a few per cent,
remaining cross-calibration issues between MOS and pn eﬀec-
tive areas clearly appear, and positive residuals in one instrument
are often compensated by negative residuals in the other, espe-
cially around the Fe-L complex (and more generally below 2
keV). In the 4–6 keV band, the model underestimates the spec-
tra, while above 7 keV, the opposite situation occurs. It is also
worth mentioning the apparent slightly overestimated broaden-
ing of the modelled Fe-K line complex, in particular in MOS
(seen through the characteristic dips on both sides of the peak),
which is likely due to imperfections of the RMF. The pn stacked
residuals also suggest a small oﬀset due to incorrect energy cali-
bration. Although the last two points should not signiﬁcantly af-
fect our results, the overall shape of the stacked residuals clearly
illustrates that, despite past and recent eﬀorts to cross-calibrate
the EPIC instruments, imperfections are still present and bring
additional uncertainties in the parameter determination (see also
Schellenberger et al. 2015). In particular, the biased determi-
nation of the continuum, especially beyond 4 keV, emphasises
the importance of using a local ﬁtting method to derive reliable
abundances (Sect. 3.3).

We do the same exercise, this time by ﬁtting the instruments
independently (to minimise the cross-calibration residuals dis-
cussed above), and by setting all the line emission to zero in
the gdem model after having ﬁtted the spectra. We calculate the
residuals relative to this “continuum only” model for each obser-
vation, and we sum the residuals as described above. The stacked
result is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 4, and reveals all the
emission lines/complexes that the EPIC instruments are able to
resolve. The small stacked error bars on the residuals allow us to
detect the main emission lines of chromium (Cr) and manganese
(Mn) around ∼5.7 keV and ∼6.2 keV respectively. Following
the Gauss method described in Mernier et al. (2015), we re-ﬁt
locally the EPIC spectra of every pointing with a local contin-
uum and an additional Gaussian centred successively on these
two energies. From this we get the EWs of the two lines, which
we can convert into Cr and Mn abundances. After stacking these
measurements over the whole sample, the MOS and pn instru-
ments ﬁnd a positive detection of Cr/Fe with >7σ and >4σ sig-
niﬁcances, respectively. For Mn/Fe, the positive detection is >5σ
in both MOS and pn. Combining the MOS and pn instruments,
we obtain average Cr/Fe and Mn/Fe abundances of 1.56 ± 0.19
and 1.70±0.22, respectively. These abundances are not so diﬀer-
ent from the Fe values assumed for Cr and Mn in the previously
discussed ﬁts (Sect. 3.2), and consequently, their residuals did
not bias our ﬁts much, if at all. We also note that because the er-
ror bars of these abundances in individual pointings are often 1σ
consistent with zero, we must ensure that negative abundances
are allowed in order to avoid statistical biases when averaging
over the whole sample (Leccardi & Molendi 2008).

The stacking process described above can also be performed
separately in the hot and cool subsamples, respectively within
0.2r500 and 0.05r500. This comparison is shown in Fig. 5. Unsur-

residuals of the (0.05 + 0.2)r500 sample (using a gdem model). Before
stacking, the MOS and pn spectra of every pointing were ﬁtted simulta-
neously with coupled parameters. The vertical dotted lines indicate the
position of the detected line emissions in the EPIC spectra (see lower
panel). Bottom: EPIC stacked and redshift-corrected residuals of the
(0.05+0.2)r500 sample (using a gdem model, all instruments combined).
Before stacking, the MOS and pn spectra of every pointing were ﬁtted
independently and the line emission was set to zero in the model. The
height of the peak of the Fe-K complex is ∼1.95.

prisingly, most of the emission lines, including the Fe-L com-
plex, are clearly enhanced in the cool subsample (grey curve),
while the Fe-K and Ni-K lines are more prominent in the hot
subsample (black). Beyond ∼6 keV, the overestimate of the con-
tinuum (discussed above and in Sect 3.3) also seems more im-
portant in the cool subsample.

4.3. Systematic uncertainties

A crucial point when averaging the abundances over a large sam-
ple is that the stacked statistical uncertainties become very small.
Therefore, the systematic uncertainties may clearly dominate,
and care must be taken to evaluate them properly. The average
abundance ratios and all their uncertainties discussed below are
summarised in Table 2.

First, because of their diﬀerent chemical histories, it seems
reasonable to assume that some clusters intrinsically deviate
from the average estimated abundances. Such an intrinsic scat-
ter σint has been already introduced, and has been estimated (as
well as their 1σ uncertainties) for all the available abundance

EPIC abundance ratios are marginal, well below the range of the
other systematic uncertainties discussed above. Therefore, we
do not consider this eﬀect in the rest of this paper.

Assuming the systematic errors mentioned above to be
roughly symmetric, we add them in quadrature to obtain the total
uncertainties:

Finally, we must note that further systematic uncertainties
might still play a role. For example, we show in Appendix B
that too simple approximations in the calculation of the emission
processes might alter the line emissivities, and thus the abun-
dances we measure. Therefore, we cannot exclude that future im-
provements in the currently used spectral ﬁtting codes could still
slightly aﬀect the measurements we report here. Moreover, from
some aspects (e.g. Fe xvii line ratios; see de Plaa et al. 2012),
small deviations have been reported in the spectral modelling of
CIE plasmas using either the SPEX code, or the APEC model
(based on the AtomDB code). In terms of abundances, the dis-
crepancies between the two codes may bring further uncertain-
ties, at least for RGS measurements (de Plaa et al., to be sub-
mitted); however, APEC is a single-temperature model, which
should be avoided in this kind of analysis (Sect. 3). Moreover,
this lack of multi-temperature distribution for APEC makes a di-
rect comparison between the two codes diﬃcult.

ratios (Table 2). Except for O/Fe (∼16%) and Mg/Fe (∼29%),
the intrinsic scatter of the other elements are of the order of a
few percent. In order to remain as conservative as possible in de-
termining our ﬁnal abundance ratios, we choose to consider the
most extreme case where the true instrinsic scatters would actu-
ally correspond to the (1σ) upper limits of σint. In the follow-
ing, the systematic uncertainties we associate with the instrinsic
scatters are, therefore, σint + 1σ. Owing to their still large statis-
tical error bars, no intrinsic scatter was needed for Ar/Fe, Cr/Fe,
Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe.

Second, we investigate whether the average abundance ra-
tios change signiﬁcantly when considering diﬀerent EPIC ex-
traction regions and/or subsamples. The comparison of these ra-
tios over the four (sub-)samples described in Sect. 4.1 is shown
in Fig. 6 (left panel). The abundance ratios of all the elements
are consistent, except for S/Fe and Ar/Fe, which we discuss
more extensively in Sect. 5.1. For these two elements, we deter-
mine the systematic uncertainty σregion by artiﬁcially increasing

Third, after correction for σint and σregion, we look for pos-
sible cross-calibration biases by comparing the average abun-
dances estimated from the separate XMM-Newton instruments
(Fig. 6, right panel). Three elements have MOS and pn abun-
dance ratios that diﬀer with more than 1σ signiﬁcance, and need
an additional systematic uncertainty (σcross-cal, deﬁned similarly
to σregion): Si/Fe, Ar/Fe, and Ni/Fe. The last two are the most
striking: pn estimates the Ar/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios on average re-
spectively ∼25% lower and ∼52% higher than MOS. A further
discussion on the discrepancies found in these two ratios will be
addressed in Sect. 5.1.

Fourth, since the conversion from the EW of a considered
line to the abundance of its element strongly depends on the
plasma temperature, a multi-temperature structure deviating
from the gdem distribution may aﬀect the abundance ratios. We
investigate this dependency for the best EPIC observations of
Perseus and M 87 in Appendix C. Among the two continuous
temperature distributions tested here (which are thought to be
the most reasonable to describe the thermal structure of the
ICM; e.g. de Plaa et al. 2006), we ﬁnd that the deviations in the

5. Discussion

In this work, we have derived the abundances in the cores of 44
galaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals (CHEERS), using both
the EPIC and RGS instruments. We have shown (Fig. 2) that
the abundance ratios of O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe,
Ca/Fe, and Ni/Fe are quite uniform over the considered ranges
of temperatures in the sample (0.6–8 keV). These results corrob-
orate the study of De Grandi & Molendi (2009), who also found
ﬂat trends for Si/Fe and Ni/Fe independently of the considered
clusters. This strongly suggests that regardless of their precise
nature and of their diﬀerent spatial scales, the physical processes
that are responsible for the enrichment of the ICM must be the
same for ellipticals, galaxy groups, and galaxy clusters.

Unlike these ratios, the absolute Fe abundance is far from
being uniform, and seems much more dependent on cluster his-
tory (Fig. 1). The scatter is more important in the inner regions
(0.05r500) of the core. A less scattered Fe abundance within
0.2r500 could suggest a ﬂatter abundance distribution as we look
away from the centre with a similar level of enrichment outside

the core of most objects. This is in agreement with the hypoth-
esis of an early (pre-)enrichment, supported by recent Suzaku
observations of outskirts of clusters/groups (Werner et al. 2013;
Simionescu et al. 2015).

The cool groups/ellipticals appear on average to be less Fe-
rich than the hot clusters. In particular, it is interesting to note
that nine hot clusters have an Fe abundance that is higher than
proto-solar within 0.05r500, while, at the same scale, no cool
group/elliptical has a similar feature (Fig. 3). This trend has been
already reported observationally (Rasmussen & Ponman 2009)
and in simulations (Liang et al. 2016). It might be explained by
several scenarios:

– More massive objects are more eﬃcient in retaining metals
within their core (owing to their larger gravitational well or
a less powerful AGN activity);

– The more massive clusters are somewhat more eﬃcient in

injecting synthesised metals into the ICM;

– The galaxies of the more massive clusters are somewhat

more eﬃcient in producing stars, and hence, SNe;

– A more eﬃcient cooling in group cores removes the enriched

gas observed in X-ray.

While Liang et al. (2016) propose that the last scenario ex-
plains the lack of metal-rich gas in lower-mass (hence, lower-
temperature) objects, Rasmussen & Ponman (2009) explored the
four possibilities, and argue that the the two ﬁrst are the most
likely. In particular, the galactic outﬂows could be less eﬃcient
in releasing metals in the ICM of cooler groups or, alternatively,
the AGN activity of the BCG could have helped to remove met-
als from their core (see also Yates et al. 2016). However, we must
emphasise that several of these mechanisms might co-exist, and
that the list above is not necessarily exhaustive. For instance,
Elkholy et al. (2015) recently found a hint of a positive correla-
tion between the metallicity in low-mass clusters, and the mor-
phological disturbance of their ICM (likely related to the dynam-
ical activity of their galaxy members). Alternatively, cooler ICM
might be more eﬃcient in depleting ionic Fe (and probably other
metals) into grains close to the brightest central galaxy, although

Article number, page 10 of 17

Panagoulia et al. (2015) found hints of Fe depletion in the cores
of more massive clusters as well.

We must warn, however, that the large intrinsic scatters men-
tioned above prevent us from claiming any clear and signiﬁcant
trend on the absolute Fe abundances. Moreover, a more compli-
cated thermal structure in groups/ellipticals than in more massive
clusters cannot be excluded, and could lead to a slight but signif-
icant Fe bias, which would aﬀect in priority the cooler objects in
our sample.

We have also found an apparent variation in the Fe abun-
dance and temperature gradients (i.e. between 0.05r500 and
0.2r500) in the hot clusters. These diﬀerences could be related
to the individual cluster enrichment histories or to other param-
eters, such as the cooling rate. Linking the history of each clus-
ter/group to its Fe budget requires a more careful spatial study
of the Fe distribution. Establishing radial proﬁles for the entire
sample is beyond the scope of this work, but will be addressed
in a separate paper.

From the stacked results of our (0.05 + 0.2)r500 sample, we
have estimated the average abundance ratios and their respec-
tive total uncertainties (statistical and systematic). This also in-
cludes Cr/Fe and Mn/Fe, which we have detected within >4σ
signiﬁcance with MOS and pn independently. To our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst time that Mn has been ﬁrmly detected in
the ICM. For comparison, Werner et al. (2006) already detected
Cr in 2A 0335+096 within 2σ (but were unable to detect Mn),
while Cr and Mn have been detected in Perseus within 5σ and
1σ, respectively (Tamura et al. 2009). It is also striking to note
that we do not see any emission line feature around ∼3.5 keV in
the stacked EPIC spectra (Fig. 4 bottom, Fig5) contrary to sev-
eral claims from recent studies, in particular Bulbul et al. (2014)
and Boyarsky et al. (2014), whose total EPIC net exposure times
are ∼3 Ms and ∼1.5 Ms, respectively (i.e. less than in this work).
Such an apparent non-detection is thus very interesting to re-
port, since it might challenge the hypothesis of decaying sterile
neutrinos, known as a dark matter candidate, being observed in
the ICM. We note that the dark matter interpretation is far from
being the only possible explanation of an emission line at ∼3.5

keV (e.g. Gu et al. 2015), and our non-detection could also be ex-
plored in the context of these other possibilities. However, this
question is not the initial purpose of this present study, and a
more detailed investigation of our stacked spectra around ∼3.5
keV, and consequent discussions, are left to a future paper.

5.1. Discrepancies in the S/Fe, Ar/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios

The average S/Fe ratio shows a slight but signiﬁcant enhance-
ment in the cool objects within 0.05r500 compared to the hot ob-
jects within 0.2r500 (Fig. 6). From Fig. 2 (left, third panel), it is
clearly that M 49 (kTmean ∼ 1.148 keV) and A 3581 (kTmean ∼
1.637 keV) largely contribute to this higher S/Fe ratio measured
in the cool subsample because their statistical errors are small
compared to the other cool objects. Moreover, the >1σ discrep-
ancy between the cool and hot measured S/Fe ratios disappears
when considering the same radius (0.05r500) for all the objects.

The Ar/Fe discrepancy observed in Fig. 6 (left) is more in-
triguing, since a larger aperture seems to lower its measurement.
This trend is diﬃcult to interpret. A change in the relative Ar to
Fe radial distribution in the ICM cannot be excluded, although
we would then expect it for other elements as well. A full study
of the abundance radial proﬁles of the sample will be performed
in a future paper. Furthermore, it also appears from Fig. 6 (right)
that MOS and pn measure signiﬁcantly diﬀerent Ar/Fe values,
even after taking account of the uncertainty described above (i.e.
σregion). The reason for this second Ar/Fe discrepancy is again
challenging to clearly identify, but it is very likely due to imper-
fections in the calibration of the EPIC instruments.

As seen in Fig. 6 (right), the large MOS-pn discrepancy
in the Ni/Fe abundance ratio prevents us from deriving a pre-
cise measurement. This discrepancy is worrying, but can be ex-
plained by imperfections in the cross-calibration of the two in-
struments. Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, the high en-
ergy band around the Ni-K transitions is signiﬁcanly aﬀected
by the instrumental background (as the ﬂux of the cluster emis-
sion sharply decreases at high energies). This hard particle back-
ground (already mentioned in Sect. 3.1) has a diﬀerent spectral
shape in MOS and pn, which might even vary with time, thus be-
tween observations. In particular, an instrumental line (Cu Kα)
is known to aﬀect pn at a rest-frame energy of ∼8 keV (Mernier
et al. 2015). Despite our eﬀorts to carefully estimate the back-
ground, that line might interfere with the Ni-K line in several
observations, making a proper modelling of the Ni-K line im-
possible, and hence, boosting the Ni absolute abundance in pn. In
this context, it can be instructive to compare our Ni/Fe measure-
ments with those of Suzaku, which has a lower relative hard par-
ticle background. Sato et al. (2007b) (A 1060) and Tamura et al.
(2009) (Perseus) reported ratios of ∼1.3±0.4 and ∼1.11±0.19,
respectively (after rescaling to the proto-solar values). Although
these measurements might be also be aﬀected by further uncer-
tainties (e.g. the choice of the spectral modelling, Sect. 4.3), they
appear to be consistent with the Ni/Fe average ratio measured
with MOS is this work, favouring our above supposition that
MOS is more trustworthy than pn for measuring Ni/Fe. How-
ever, in order to be conservative, we prefer to retain the pn value
as a possible result and, therefore, we keep large systematic un-
certainties for Ni/Fe. We ﬁnally note that, unsurprisingly, Ni/Fe
cannot be constrained in the cool objects (Fig. 6, left) because
the gas temperature is too low to excite Ni-K transitions.

Fig. 7. Average abundance ratios in our (0.05 + 0.2)r500 sample (black
squares) versus proto-solar abundances (grey dashed line) and their 1σ
uncertainties (red dash-dotted lines, adapted from Lodders et al. 2009).

5.2. Comparison with the proto-solar abundance ratios

In Fig. 7 (black squares), we report our ﬁnal X/Fe abundance
pattern measured in the (0.05 + 0.2)r500 sample, accounting for
all the systematic uncertainties discussed earlier in this paper. At
ﬁrst glance, most of the abundance ratios measured in the ICM
look signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the proto-solar abundance ra-
tios. Indeed, if we ﬁt a constant to our abundance pattern (dashed
grey line), we obtain a χ2 of 43.1 for 10 degrees of freedom, in
poor agreement with the abundance ratios in the ICM. However,
as shown by the red dash-dotted lines (adapted from Lodders
et al. 2009), the solar abundance ratios also suﬀer from large un-
certainties, typically about 20–25%. When comparing the two
sets of abundance ratios taken with their respective uncertain-
ties, we ﬁnd that the O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Si/Fe S/Fe, Ar/Fe,
and Ca/Fe ratios measured in the ICM are consistent within 1σ
with the proto-solar values (±1σ). The Cr/Fe abundance ratios
measured in the ICM are consistent within 2σ with the proto-
solar values (±1σ), and the Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe abundance ratios
are consistent within 3σ.

Given these considerations, whether the chemical enrich-
ment in the ICM is similar to the chemical enrichment of the
solar neighbourhood is not a trivial question to solve. As men-
tioned above, while most of the relative abundances appear to
be consistent with being proto-solar, Ni/Fe, Mn/Fe, and perhaps
Cr/Fe seem to be signiﬁcantly enhanced. This result might be of
interest since signiﬁcant diﬀerent abundance ratios in the ICM
means that the fraction of SNIa (or conversely SNcc) respon-
sible for the ICM enrichment diﬀers from that of the Galactic
enrichment. We will address this discussion in greater detail in
Paper II. We recall, however, that the abundances of interest in
this context (Cr, Mn, and Ni) are not well constrained in X-ray,
given the current instrument capabilities. Moreover, as speciﬁed
in Sect. 4.3, we do not exclude that diﬀerences in current atomic
codes might bring further systematic uncertainties to the mea-
surements reported in this work. Therefore, whether our abun-
dance ratios are signiﬁcantly more accurate than the proto-solar
estimates should still be considered an open question.

5.3. Current limitations and future prospects

As we have shown throughout this paper, our excellent data
quality (∼4.5 Ms and ∼3.7 Ms of total net exposure time for
EPIC MOS and pn, respectively) provides very accurate abun-
dance measurements in the ICM of cool-core galaxy clusters and
groups. Therefore, these data should be a legacy for any future
work directly or indirectly related to the chemical enrichment in
the ICM. However, our study clearly reveals that the abundance
ratios of some elements of interest are still poorly constrained.
In particular, the Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios in our study ap-
pear higher than the solar neighbourhood and are thus crucial
to study in detail, which is currently challenging given the lim-
ited spectral resolution of CCDs and the large cross-calibration
uncertainties (at least for Ni/Fe) that we emphasise here.

In this work we probably reach the instrumental limitations
of XMM-Newton in terms of abundance determination, and thus
stacking more data will have very little impact on the current
accuracy of our already existing measurements. Indeed, in our
sample, the statistical uncertainties are already marginal com-
pared to the systematic ones. In addition to further eﬀorts in cal-
ibrating the instruments and improving the atomic databases, it
is clear that a sensibly higher X-ray spectral resolution is now
needed.

Such an improvement can be reached with micro-calorimeter
spectrometers, which should be on board the next generation of
X-ray observatories. In particular, the Japanese X-ray observa-
tory Hitomi (formerly named ASTRO-H; Takahashi et al. 2014)
has been able to resolve, for instance, K-shell and also L-shell
Ni lines with a limited instrumental background, and should thus
reduce the Ni/Fe uncertainties to a few per cent. Unfortunately,
owing to a loss of contact a few weeks after launch, the fate
of the mission is now unclear. Alternatively, the X-IFU instru-
ment, which will be on board the Athena observatory (Nandra
et al. 2013), will greatly improve the spectral resolution currently
achieved with XMM-Newton to ∼2.5 eV. Undoubtedly, this up-
coming mission will allow a signiﬁcant step forward in such an
analysis, especially if improvements in atomic data are also car-
ried out.

6. Conclusions

In this paper, we have used the XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS in-
struments to investigate the Fe abundance and abundance ratios
of O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe,
and Ni/Fe in the central regions of 44 cool-core galaxy clusters,
groups, and elliptical galaxies (CHEERS). Our main results can
be summarised as follows.

– The X/Fe abundance ratios appear quite uniform over the
mean temperature range of our sample. This conﬁrms pre-
vious results, and indicates that no matter what the physical
mechanisms responsible for the enrichment are, they must be
very similar in enriching the ICM of ellipticals, groups, and
clusters of galaxies.

– By stacking all the EPIC spectra of our sample (within
0.2r500 when possible, within 0.05r500 otherwise), we were
able to derive abundances of Cr/Fe and Mn/Fe independently
with MOS and pn, with >4σ signiﬁcance. While Cr had been
already detected in the past, this is the ﬁrst time that a ﬁrm
detection of Mn in the hot ICM has been reported.

– Contrary to recent claims, and despite the large net exposure
time (∼4.5 Ms) of our combined data, we do not see any
emission line at ∼3.5 keV. Although a deeper investigation

Article number, page 12 of 17

will be addressed in a future paper, this might challenge the
possibility of decaying sterile neutrinos, a dark matter candi-
date, being observed in the ICM.

– The Fe abundance varies between 0.2–2 times the proto-solar
values, and shows an important scatter, especially within a
radius of 0.05r500 (∼30–40%). Looking at smaller (0.05r500)
and larger (0.2r500) central regions in a subsample of hot
clusters, it appears that the Fe peak sharpens and the tem-
perature drop ﬂattens as the mean cluster temperature de-
creases. Clearly, these various Fe abundances must depend
on individual clusters histories, and complete abundance ra-
dial proﬁles will be investigated in greater detail in a future
work.

– Having beneﬁted from a large total net exposure time (∼4.5
Ms) and having processed a very careful estimation of the
systematic eﬀects that could aﬀect our measurements, we
have shown that the systematic uncertainties clearly domi-
nate over the statistical ones. Taking these systematic uncer-
tainties into account, most of the ICM abundance ratios mea-
sured in this work are consistent with the proto-solar abun-
dance ratios. Notable exceptions are Mn/Fe, Ni/Fe, and per-
haps Cr/Fe, which are found to be signiﬁcanly higher in the
ICM than in the solar neighbourhood.

– Overall, our careful analysis demonstrates that stacking more
observations would not further improve the accuracy of our
results, and, more generally, that we have probably reached
the limits of the current X-ray capabilities (in particular
XMM-Newton) for this science case. Therefore, our data con-
stitute the most accurate abundance ratios ever measured in
the ICM, and should be a legacy for future work. Using the
results presented in this paper, a full discussion on the role
of the SNIa and SNcc in the context of both the proto-solar
and the ICM enrichments will be addressed in Paper II. How-
ever, a more accurate comparison between the local Galactic
enrichment and the ICM enrichment in the local Universe
will require improvements in atomic data, as well as better
calibration of the instruments. In parallel to these needs for
improvements, the upcoming X-ray observatories should fur-
ther improve the accuracy of the abundance measurements,
and thus help to solve the puzzle of the chemical enrichment
in the hot ICM.

Fig. A.1. Comparison between the EPIC and RGS measurements of the
O/Fe abundance ratio in most objects of our (0.05 + 0.2)r500 sample.
The blue dotted line shows the one-to-one EPIC-RGS correspondence.
In our ﬁts we alternatively ﬁx the NH to the weighted neutral+molecular
values calculated from Willingale et al. (2013), and leave it free within
the ranges given by Eq. (A.1). The two approaches are shown in red and
black, respectively.

Appendix A: EPIC absorption column densities

In the hot model used in this work to mimic absorption of X-
rays through interstellar material (Sect. 3), we initially ﬁxed the
hydrogen column density NH to the weighted value NH,tot of both
the neutral (NH i, Kalberla et al. 2005) and the molecular (NH2 ,
Schlegel et al. 1998) materials, calculated using the method of
Willingale et al. (2013)8. However, this approach often gives
poor ﬁts in the soft band of our EPIC spectral modelling, by sig-
niﬁcantly under- or overestimating the ﬂux of its continuum. In
order to compensate this eﬀect, the O abundance is often biased
consequently by the ﬁts. Fig. A.1 (red data points) clearly illus-
trates that some objects have their EPIC O/Fe ratio signiﬁcantly
oﬀset from the corresponding RGS values.

The EPIC-RGS correlation for the O/Fe ratio is clearly im-
proved if we free the NH (Fig. A.1, black data points). Similarly,
most of the ﬁts are improved in terms of C-stat/d.o.f. However,
keeping NH as a free parameter without any further constraint is
quite dangerous, and might lead to unphysical results. In order
to remain reasonably consistent with the estimated values of NH i
and NH,tot mentioned above, we allow NH to take values within
the following arbitrary limits:

NH i − 5 × 1019 cm−2 ≤ NH ≤ NH,tot + 1 × 1020 cm−2.

(A.1)

These upper and lower ranges allow limited deviations also
around NH i and NH,tot. Since constraining a free parameter within
a narrow range can lead to problems in evaluating the statisti-
cal errors, we perform a grid search of ﬁxed NH values (taken
within the limits mentioned above), and select the one that gives
the lowest C-stat/d.o.f. to the ﬁts. Despite all these precautions,
it should also be kept in mind that the O abundance measured
in clusters with EPIC is also aﬀected by the oxygen absorption
in the interstellar medium, which in turn depends on NH (e.g.
de Plaa et al. 2004). Similarly, the measured O abundance in
the ICM may be also aﬀected by the foreground thermal X-ray
emission.

Appendix C: Effects of the temperature distribution

on the abundance ratios

As already speciﬁed in Sect. 3, the measured absolute abun-
dances (in particular Fe) are in principle sensitive to the choice of
the thermal model used in the ﬁts (single- vs. multi-temperature).
Among multi-temperature models, the assumed temperature dis-
tribution might also aﬀect the measured (X/Fe) abundances. We
explore this possibility by successively ﬁtting the best-quality
observations of Perseus and M 87 (which both have excellent
statistics but rather diﬀerent mean temperatures) with a 1T (i.e.
cie), a 2T (i.e. cie+cie), and a power-law diﬀerential emission
measure model9 (wdem; see e.g. Kaastra et al. 2004). The results
are shown in Fig. C.1 and Table C.1. From Fig. C.1, it clearly
appears that the abundance pattern depends on the considered
thermal model. In particular, Ne/Fe varies a lot (i.e. by more than
a factor of 6 for Perseus and by almost a factor of 3 for M 87)
because the Ne abundance parameter from the models is used by
the ﬁts to compensate the EPIC residuals in the Fe-L complex
(e.g. de Plaa et al. 2006). This illustrates that the EPIC estimate
of Ne/Fe cannot be interpreted as a reliable Ne abundance (Sect.
4.1). Striking diﬀerences in the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios consider-
ing the four diﬀerent models should also be noted; for instance,
a considerably high Ca/Fe ratio is measured by the 1T and/or 2T
model(s).

Despite these considerations, and the fact that the real tem-
perature distributions in the ICM is unknown, considering a con-
tinuous distribution is clearly more realistic than only one or two
unique temperatures. By comparing only the gdem and wdem
models, we note that they give very similar abundance ratios
for both Perseus and M 87. Except for Ne/Fe, the largest dif-
ference is found for Ni/Fe, and is clearly smaller than the range
of systematic uncertainties aﬀecting the measurements. There-
fore, using a wdem model instead of a gdem model should have
a limited impact on our EPIC ﬁnal results. For comparison, de
Plaa et al. (to be submitted) ﬁnd that such an eﬀect on the O/Fe
ratio derived from RGS is always smaller than 20%. Therefore,
considering further uncertainties related to the thermal models is
not necessary for the purpose of this work.

Appendix D: Best-ﬁt temperature and abundances

In Table D.1 we present the full results of our best-ﬁt parameters
(kT , σT , the absolute Fe abundance, and the abundance ratios of
O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe, Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, and Ni/Fe) for
each object of CHEERS, within a radius of 0.05r500. When pos-
sible (hot clusters), we indicate the parameters extracted from
0.2r500 as well. The O/Fe and Ne/Fe abundances have been cor-
rected from updated RR calculations, as described in Appendix
B.

9 This model is thought to reproduce quite well the temperature struc-
ture in the ICM of most cool-core objects, but has not been used in this
work owing to computing time.

like Lyman α lines of O and Ne as a function of the cluster (mean)
temperature (adapted from the results of Mao & Kaastra 2016).

Appendix B: Radiative recombination corrections

The version of SPEX that is used in this work calculates the
line emissivities assuming that the radiative recombination (RR)
rates of the cluster emission can be expressed as a power law
of the electron temperature (Mewe & Gronenschild 1981; Mewe
et al. 1985). However, this approximation has turned out to be
too simpliﬁed at high temperature. A more accurate calculation
of the RR rate coeﬃcients has been done by Badnell (2006), and
parametrised by Mao & Kaastra (2016) as a function of the tem-
perature T in the form

R(T ) ∝ T −b0−c0 ln T

(cid:32)

1 + a2T −b2
1 + a1T −b1

(cid:33)

,

(B.1)

where a0, b0, c0, a1, a2, b1, and b2 are constant (ﬁtted) parame-
ters.

Since the RR rates directly aﬀect the line emissivities, which
in turn aﬀect our estimated abundances, the RR updated model
of Mao & Kaastra (2016) must be taken into account in our anal-
ysis, even though its implementation into SPEX is yet to come.
Knowing that the O and Ne emission lines seen in clusters spec-
tra are dominated by H-like Lyman α transitions, and that these
two elements are the most aﬀected by changing RR rates, we
correct their abundances by computing the change in ﬂux of their
H-like Lyman α lines from the old RR calculations (i.e. used in
the current SPEX version) to the new ones. This RR correction
factor is shown (again, for O and Ne) in Fig. B.1 as a function of
the plasma temperature, and is to be multiplied by the measured
O and Ne abundances of each object in our sample.

Figure B.1 clearly shows that better calculations of the RR
rates can lead to signiﬁcant increases of the estimated O and
Ne abundances in hot clusters. After applying this RR correc-
tion factor for each source, we ﬁnd that, on average, the O/Fe
and Ne/Fe abundance ratios increase by ∼20% and ∼9%, respec-
tively. We note, however, that reprocessing the whole analysis
presented in this paper by using the uncorrected O and Ne abun-
dance values does not aﬀect our main conclusions, since we keep
large systematic uncertainties in the ﬁnal abundance ratios.
