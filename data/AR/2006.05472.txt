Abstract  

  The long standing controversy between the melting curves of the bcc Mo,Ta,W and vanadium 
  (V) metals measured by diamond anvil Cells (DAC) and the shock dynamic experiments  is 

explained by the behavior  the liquid or solid pressure transmitting mediums compressed by the 
thermal expansion of the these transition metals. This explains the observed isobaric behavior of 
the laser heated  DAC experiments containing different transmitting mediums reported in the 
literature [1, 2, 3], thus solving the standing enigma described in very many publications. 

   It  is shown that the Ar pressure transmitting medium is in its liquid state which is compressed  
by the thermal expansion of the Mo,Ta,W metals. The liquid Ar shows evidence of a liquid-
liquid phase transition. This is observed by a density (viscosity) change upon increasing the 
pressure and the temperature in the laser heated DAC. Two density regions are detected: below ~ 
40GPa where dTm/dP >0  and above ~40 GPa where dTm/dP → 0. The different slopes of the 
melting curves  are  enlarged  in the insets of Fig.s 2-4 indicating different resistance to the 
thermal expansion of the transition metals relative to the softer liquid Ar. The melting anomaly 
observed above 40GPa is discussed.

  Introduction-The standing controversy between the static DAC measurements  and 
the dynamic  shock wave melting curves of the bcc transition metals is an important 
physical issue that attracted the high pressure researchers for long time. It is about 
two decades since D. Errandonea, B.Schwager, R. Ditz, C. Gessmann, R. Boehler 
and  M.  Ross  published  in  PRB  the  paper  “  Systematics  of  the  transition  metals 
melting”  [1].  The  high-pressure-temperature  measurements  of  Mo,Ta,W  and  V 
metals were performed  in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell (DAC) up to nearly 100 
GPa  and  4000  K  where  most  data  were  obtained  in  argon  pressure    transmitting 
medium (PTM). Small melting slopes which approach zero at high pressures were 
reported hinting isobaric conditions in the DAC. All the experimental dynamic shock 
waves data (SW) and first principle ab-initio DFT calculations for the  melting of 
these transition metals are incompatible with Errandonea’s et al. DAC experiments. 
Nevertheless,  no  conclusive  explanations  of  this  behavior  can  be  found  in  the 
literature, thus up to date the discrepancy between the SW data and the DAC data 
remains enigmatic.   

  It has been shown by Dewaele et al.[2]  and recently be Errandonea et al. [3] that this 
isobaric behavior is strongly related to the behavior of the PTM used in the DAC 
experiments.  Commonly used  for pressure  transmitting mediums are Ar, Al2O3, 
KCl , NaCl, MgO [3]. In the present contribution the behavior of Ar PTM is analyzed 
taking  into  account  the  negligible  chemical  reaction  of  the  medium  with  the 
investigated sample and with the compressing diamonds [1].  

   Studies of compressed noble gases revealed  different slope of the melting curves of 
Ar,Xe,Kr which were related to the fcc and the hcp crystallographic structures [4]. 
Recently,  the  extrapolated  melting  curve  of  compressed  Ar,  utilizing  Gilvarry-
Lindemann approximated (LG) criterion,  indicated  that under  pressures and above  
4500K, Ar is absolutely in the liquid state [5] . In the present paper it is claimed that 
the experimental data measured by D. Errandonea  et al. shows evidence of a liquid-
liquid phase transition in Ar which is observed by a density (viscosity) change upon 
increasing the pressure and the temperature in the laser heated DAC.       

   In conclusion, it is claimed that the discrepancy between the SW data and the DAC 
data  or  the  ab-initio  DFT  calculations  [6,7,8,9]  can  be  explained  by  the  thermal 
expansion of the hard transition metals Mo, Ta, W pressing the softer Ar liquid PTM. 
This  applies  also  to  vanadium  metal  using  different  pressure  mediums  (see 
discussion). The enigma mentioned above is thus solved.

  The combined approach-  In previous publications it was shown that by introducing 
a constraint demanding that the fitting of the experimental equation of state (EOS) 
will simultaneously fit the experimental melting data. By combining the LG criterion 
with the EOS a consistent bulk moduli are obtained allowing the extrapolation of the 
fitted melting curves to high pressures and temperatures. Assuming harmonic Debye 
solids and adopting the LG approximation [10], good fits of the melting curve at 
high pressures and temperatures for Al,Cu and U metals as well as for Ar,Xe Kr, 
were obtained [5]. Utilizing the present  combined approach and assuming negligible 
thermal  pressure  the  melting  curve  and  the  EOS  of  compressed  Ar  were 
simultaneously fitted and parametrized as depicted in Fig.1: 

                                             Liquid 

                                                                    hcp 

                                      fcc                                     

Fig.  1:  Argon  phase  diagram  and  EOS.  Melting  curve  of  the  fcc  and  hcp  phases    fitted  separately  for  each 
crystallographic phase (fcc,hcp) utilizing  the combined approach step 1 [5]. The EOS (P-V space) is shown in the 
inset. Note that the phase transition (slope) observed in the melting curve is also clearly pronounced in the EOS inset. 
The solid lines represent fittings  appllying Murnaghan equation of state. 

The solid lines are the best fits parameterized with Bo=8.5(2)GPa , Bo’=3.5  
and γo =1.6 (marked 8.5/3.5/1.7) for the fcc phase and Bo=13(2)GPa, Bo’=3.5 and  
γo =2.10 (marked 13/3.5/2.10) for the hcp crystallographic region. The derived bulk 
modulus indicate that hcp-Ar is an extremely soft solid. Most important result is that 
in any pressure above 4500K Ar is in its liquid state.

Molybdenum-  At ambient temperature and approaching the melt Mo is a body- 
centered-cubic (bcc-Im3m) 4d transition metal. The pressure dependent melting 
temperatures of the Mo metal is taken from  D. Errandonea et al. [1]. These high- 
pressure measurements were performed in a laser-heated DAC with argon (PTM)   
up to nearly 100 GPa and 4000 K. Most striking in Ref.1(Fig.1) is that after melting 
no chemical reaction of the Mo metal with the tungsten (diamond coated) gasket or 
with the pressing diamonds can be identified. In addition,  above 35GPa the slope 
approach zero indicating isobaric conditions in the DAC. Nevertheless, all the 
experimental dynamic shock waves (SW) data  [7,14] and first principle ab-initio DFT 
calculations reveal incompatible melting curve with Errandonea’s et al.[1] DAC 
experiments.  

The melting of Mo metal measured by dynamic and static experiments are depicted in 
Fig.2:

SW data reported by L.C.Cai [7].  The solid blue line is the melting curve fitted with Gilvarry-Lindemann 
approximated criterion combined with Vinet EOS. The red squares are the melting points measured in a 
DAC with Ar PTM [1]. The inset clearly demonstrate two regions of melting slopes which are related to the 
melted Ar compressed by the Mo thermal expansion. The magenta x line and blue dashed line represent Ar 
melting curve.  (b) Isotherm 300K fitted with Vinet EOS parametrized with Bo=260(4) and Bo’=4.2(2)

  In  Fig.2(a)  the  parametrization  of  the  bulk  moduli  and  the  melting  curve  yield 
Bo=260(4) GPa and Bo’=4.2(2) and γo=1.85(1)  (marked 260/4.2/1.85). The fitting 
and the extrapolation takes into account only the experimental SW melting data as 
recorded by L.C. Cai et al. [7]. By applying the LG criterion together with the EOS 
constraint  (the  combined  approach)  the  extrapolated  melting  curve  of  Mo  was 
obtained  assuming  that  the  SW  data  is  the  anchor.  The  magenta  x  line  and  the 
extrapolated dashed blue line are the Ar melting curve indicating that Ar is a liquid 
PTM.  The enlarged P-T melting data in the inset clearly shows two different slope 
regions  dTm/dP=7K/GPa)  and  dTm/dP=0K/GPa.  In  Fig.2(b)  the  blue  solid  line 
represents the 300K isotherm fitted with VIN EOS of the experimental P-V deta [6]. 
As  the  Ar  PTM  is  in  the  liquid  state  the  volume  thermal  expansion  of  the 
molybdenum metal compress the liquid Ar which show different densities in the two 
pressure regions, evidence of liquid-liquid phase transition.  

 Tantalum:    Ta  is  a  body-  centered-cubic  (bcc-Im3m)  at  room  temperature  and 
approaching the melt [15,16]. The pressure dependent melting temperatures of Ta 
metal confined in the DAC [1] were performed in  argon PTM and a laser-heated 
DAC up to nearly 100 GPa and 4000 K. Above 35GPa the melting slope approach 
zero and definitely points to isobaric conditions in the DAC. Similar to Mo, all the 
experimental  dynamic  shock  waves  data  (SW)  and  first  principle  ab-initio 
calculations [16,17] are incompatible with Errandonea’s et al. DAC experiments [1]. 
Certain corrections using non equilibrium heat flashing [17] or different PTM [3] 
failed to match the melting curve of Ta based on the SW anchor.

and Bo’=3.6(2) and γo=1.68(1) marked 194/3.6/1.68 in the figure. The fitting and the 
extrapolation takes into account only the measured experimental SW melting data 
as reported by C. Dai  at al.[14] and Haskins and Moriarty [16]. By applying the LG 
criterion  together  with  the  EOS  constraint  (the  combined  approach)  the  melting

curve of Ta is obtained. The enlarged P-T melting data measured in the DAC, shown 
in  the  inset,  clearly  demonstrate  two  different  regions  of  slopes,  0-40  GPa  with 
dTm/dP=9K/GPa  and  dTm/dP=1K/GPa  above  40GPa.  As  the  Ar  PTM    is  in  the 
liquid state, the thermal expansion of the hard solid Ta metal compress the soft Ar 
liquid. Two different slop regions  are clearly observed in the inset of Fig.3, reliant  
to the resistance of the Ar liquid, evidence of liquid-liquid phase transition in the 
molten Ar.   

 Tungsten-  Approaching  the melt W exhibits a body- centered-cubic (bcc-Im3m) 
crystallographic structure. The pressure dependent melting temperatures of the W 
metal confined in a DAC embedded in Ar PTM, as reported by D. Errandonea et 
al.[1],  is  shown  in  Fig  3(a).  The  measurements  were  performed  under  similar 
conditions of Mo and Ta. The experimental dynamic SW melting point is the only 
data reported in the literature [6,8]. The melting curve is constructed with the LG 
and  VIN  EOS  (combined  approach)  and  parametrized  with  Bo=300(4)GPa, 
Bo’=4.2(2) and γo =1.97 (300/4.2/1.97), in accord K. D. Litasov et al.[22].

slopes, 0-42 GPa with dTm/dP=5.47K/GPa, and above 42GPa dTm/dP~1K/GPa.  As 
the Ar PTM is in the liquid state (magenta X and dashed blue) the volume thermal 
expansion of the hard solid W metal presses the soft liquid Ar.  The two different 
density  regions  are  clearly  observed,  evidence  of  liquid-liquid  phase  transition  in 
liquid Ar.   

Discussion – There are three important contributions  on the melting properties of 
Mo,Ta and W metals studied separately by laser-heated DAC utilizing Ar as PTM; 
the first is Arrandonea et al. [1] (2001) followed by  C. Dewaele et al.(2010) [2] and  
A.Karandiker  and  R.  Boehler  [17]  (2016).  Each  of  the  reported  measurements 
yielded  different  melting,  raising  the  question  whether  the  interpretation  of  the 
experimental results are misleading. The latest paper [17] calls for a reevaluation of 
theoretical,  shock  compression,  and  diamond  cell  approaches  to  determine  the 
melting at high pressures. I would rather say that the DFT simulations including the 
quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) predictions are, within the errors, in accord 
with    the  experimental  SW  data  (see  Fig.1,[17]).  As  will  be  discussed  below  the 
reason for the discrepancies comes from the thermal expansion interplay between 
the investigated sample and the PTM in DAC measurements.  

   There exist three situations in DAC experiments; 

1.  The melting temperature of PTM and the bulk modulus at ambient temperature   
are much  higher than the investigated  sample. For example, Al2O3, KCL or 

8 

 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
Ar are used in DAC experiments deriving melting points of Al and Cu metals. 
Here, at each applied pressure the  thermal pressure increases upon raising the 
temperature  in  association  with  increase  of  the  melting  temperature,  thus 
isochoric condition in the DAC exists [10].   

2.  The melting temperature of PTM is very much lower than the melting 

temperature and bulk modulus of the investigated sample. Namely, high 
compressible PTM as compared to  extremely low compressibility of  
Mo,Ta,W and V, exhibiting very high melting temperatures. For example, 
liquids Ar, Al2O3, KCL or NaCl  PTMs as compared to the above transition 
metals. Here, very small thermal pressure can develop leading to observed 
isobaric like situation in the DAC.   

3.  No PTM, meaning that the investigated sample (pressed powder) fills the 

whole volume in the DAC up to the gasket, preventing uniaxial stress, like 
for example in the case of Zr metal [19]. 

   In the present study I concentrate on transition metals confined in a DAC imbedded 
in an Ar bath. Upon reaching the melt no chemical reaction with the diamonds with 
Ar  or  with  the  gasket  has  been  observed  [1,17].  The  transition  metals  melting 
temperatures  at  zero  pressure  and  ambient  conditions  are  2869K(Mo), 
3290K(Ta),3655(W) (handbook). The bulk moduli  as calculate above revealed high  
Bo= 260,194,300 GPa respectively, compared to compressed solid Ar Bo=8-13GPa 
and melting temperatures of 400-2200K,  which upon raising the temperature all the 
way Ar is liquid.   

  The  only  experiment  in  which  the  samples  were  indeed  completely  molten  is 
Errandonea  et al. [1].  Starting from ambient pressure and temperature, the samples 
confined in the DAC sense small thermal pressure yielding increase of the melting 
temperature in the region 0~40GPa.  Above 40GPa  isobaric behavior is observed 
Fig.s 2-4, all in thermodynamically equilibrium state. Critics on the measurements 
of Ref.2 can be found in Ref.17 pointing that the measurements are performed in a 
non-equilibrium conditions. However, the measurements reported by  A.Karandiker 
and R. Boehler [17] are completely different from the measurements of Errandonea 
et al. because  of the following reasons:  the flushing    laser-speckle pattern  on the 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sample surface forms a non-equilibrium heat spike in which the molten Ta expansion 
is  suppressed  by  surrounding  solid  Ta  metal.  Thus,  developing  thermal  pressure 
yielding    higher  pressure  and  elevated  melting  temperatures  as  depicted  in  Fig.2 
black squares. In addition, the determination of melting by in-situ XRD is partially 
correct as this information relate only to the surface of the sample.  

  The recent (Sep. 2019) contribution of D.Errandonea et al [2] demonstrates  that the 
melting  curve  and  phase  diagram  of  vanadium  under  high-pressure  and  high-
temperature  conditions  measured  by  DAC,  show  closer  matching  to  the  SW 
experimental and theoretical DFT(QMD) calculations. They used  NaCl or MgO as 
PTM which  are mostly solid [21] and exhibits higher resistance to the expansion of 
the  V  metal,  yielding  thermal  pressure  which  elevates  the  melting  temperature 
accordingly.  Thus,  better  matching  the  SW  up  to  ~  60GPa  was  obtained. 
Nevertheless, the pressure reported in Fig.5 of Ref.2 is not the actual pressure.   

   Finally, Errandonea et al. measurements were based on  observation of a change in 
the emissivity of the surface until a complete melting was achieved. In addition, they 
used  diamond-coated  tungsten  gaskets  which  are  known  for  excellent  sealing.  It 
could  be  claimed  that  for  some  reason  these  gaskets  leaks  above  40GPa  and  the 
liquid-liquid transition observed is just an artefact. However, Errandonea at al. [1,21] 
reported that the in situ laser spackle method gave the same results where no changes 
in  the  surface  texture  on  recovered  or  quenched  samples  were  ovserved. 
Nevertheless,  what  is  missing  in  their  research  are  several  pressure-temperature 
cycles looking for hysteresis effects that would prove that no Ar was lost. Trusting 
the high quality experimental work performed by D. Errandonea and his coworkers 
I  conclude  that  liquid  to  liquid  phase  transition  do  occur  in  liquid  argon  under 
pressures  and  high  temperatures.  The  fact  that  above  40GPa  Tm/dP→0  is  an 
anomaly that should be further considered. 

  It is proposed to re-measure  the melting temperatures of Mo,Ta,W and V 
  without PTM according to situation 3 explained above [19], predicting no 
  discrepancy between DAC and SW results.

  Conclusions  –  Thermal  expansion  of    Mo,Ta,W  metals  imbedded  in  an  Ar  bath 
confined  in  a  DAC  compress  the  softer  liquid  Ar  PTM.  Two  viscus  regions  are 
observed:  0  to  ~40  GPa    and    above  40  GPa,  evidence  of  liquid-liquid  phase 
transition.  

  The DFT simulations including the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) predictions 
are, within the errors, are in accord with the experimental SW data. The reason for 
the discrepancies between the SW and DAC experiments comes from the interplay 
between the thermal expansion of  Mo, Ta, W, V samples vs. the soft PTMs in DAC 
experiments.
