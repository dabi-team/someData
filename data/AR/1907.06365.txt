ABSTRACT

Context. In September 2017 the largest X-class ﬂare of Solar Cycle 24 occured from the most active region (AR) of this cycle, AR
12673. The AR attracted much interest because of its unique morphological and evolution characteristics. Among the parameters
examined in the AR was magnetic helicity, but either only approximately, and/or intermittently.
Aims. This work is interested in studying the evolution of the relative magnetic helicity and of the two components of its decomposi-
tion, the non-potential, and the volume-threading one, in the time interval around the highest activity of AR 12673. Special emphasis
is given on the study of the ratio of the non-potential to total helicity, that was recently proposed as an indicator of ARs eruptivity.
Methods. For these, we ﬁrst approximate the coronal magnetic ﬁeld of the AR with two diﬀerent optimization-based extrapolation
procedures, and choose the one that produces the most reliable helicity value at each instant. Moreover, in one of these methods, we
weight the optimization by the uncertainty estimates derived from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument, for the
ﬁrst time. We then follow an accurate method to compute all quantities of interest.
Results. The ﬁrst observational determination of the evolution of the non-potential to total helicity ratio seems to conﬁrm the quality
it has in indicating eruptivity. This ratio increases before the major ﬂares of AR 12673, and afterwards it relaxes to smaller values.
Additionally, the evolution patterns of the various helicity, and energy budgets of AR 12673 are discussed and compared with other
works.

1. Introduction

Magnetic helicity is a physical quantity that is used often in
investigations of the eruptive behaviour of solar active regions
(ARs, Rust 1994; Nindos & Andrews 2004; Green et al. 2018).
This is because it is a conserved quantity of ideal magneto-
hydrodynamics (MHD), and thus it determines the dynamics of
magnetized systems (Taylor 1974; Pariat et al. 2015; Linan et al.
2018). Magnetic helicity is a geometrical quantity that describes
the level of complexity of a magnetic ﬁeld, through the twist and
writhe of its ﬁeld lines, and their interlinking.

Magnetic helicity however is well deﬁned only for systems
that are magnetically closed, and thus is of limited use in the Sun
and all other astrophysical conditions. The appropriate form of
helicity in these situations is relative magnetic helicity (Berger
& Field 1984; Finn & Antonsen 1985). It is deﬁned through a
volume integral as

H =

(cid:90)

V

(A + Ap) · (B − Bp) dV,

(1)

where B denotes the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic ﬁeld in
the volume of interest, V, while Bp is a reference ﬁeld that usu-
ally is taken to be potential. The two ﬁelds are generated from
the vector potentials A and Ap. The potential magnetic ﬁeld is
chosen to have the same normal components with B along the
boundary of the volume, ∂V, namely
ˆn · B|∂V = ˆn · Bp|∂V ,

(2)

with ˆn denoting the unit vector that is normal to ∂V. This choice
guaranties that the relative magnetic helicity given by Eq. 1 is

independent from the gauges of the vector potentials, and thus
physically meaningful.

Relative magnetic helicity can also be uniquely split into two

gauge-independent components (Berger 1999), namely
H = Hj + Hpj.

These are the non-potential component

Hj =

(cid:90)

V

(A − Ap) · (B − Bp) dV,

(3)

(4)

that depends only on the current-carrying part of the magnetic
ﬁeld, Bj = B − Bp, and the volume-threading component

Hpj = 2

(cid:90)

V

Ap · (B − Bp) dV,

(5)

that depends additionally on the potential ﬁeld. The detailed
analysis of the behaviour of these components, and of their dy-
namics in Linan et al. (2018), showed that, unlike relative mag-
netic helicity, they are not conserved quantities of ideal MHD.

The study of the diﬀerent components of relative magnetic
helicity is important however, as they provide additional infor-
mation compared to H. Already from the ﬁrst separate examina-
tion of these two components in eruptive ARs (Moraitis et al.
2014), it was observed that the non-potential component was
ﬂuctuating in accordance with the eruptions of the AR. This was
noted in both observed, and synthetic, MHD-modelled eruptive
ARs.

Moreover, using this decomposition of helicity in a set of
eruptive, and non-eruptive MHD ﬂux-emergence simulations,

Pariat et al. (2017) have determined that the ratio |Hj|/|H| is
an excellent indicator of the system’s eruptivity. They noticed
that the helicity ratio behaved diﬀerently in the eruptive than in
the non-eruptive simulations, as well as between the pre-, and
post-eruptive phases of the former. The helicity ratio obtained
high values only in the eruptive cases, and only before the erup-
tions. The possible importance of |Hj|/|H| was also highlighted
in Linan et al. (2018) by using an MHD simulation of the forma-
tion of a coronal jet. Again, the helicity ratio attained very high
values during the generation of the jet, and it droped signiﬁcantly
after that.

This result was further tested in Zuccarello et al. (2018) with
a diﬀerent set of line-tied, eruptive MHD simulations where the
quality of the helicity ratio as an eruptivity indicator was recon-
ﬁrmed. Additionally, by carefully identifying the onset of the
eruption in these simulations, it was found that a threshold value
of |Hj|/|H| (cid:39) 0.3 was reached by all simulations when the erup-
tions occured.

These promising results on the ratio |Hj|/|H| led to an interest
in deriving it in observations. In a ﬁrst observational determina-
tion of the helicity ratio, James et al. (2018) have found the value
|Hj|/|H| (cid:39) 0.17 for the ﬂux rope of an AR, one hour before the
occurence of an eruption. A reasonable next step is to study the
evolution of the helicity ratio in an observed AR, which is the
central task of this work.

A perfect target for this is the most active region of Solar
Cycle 24, AR 12673 (Sun & Norton 2017). During its passage
through the solar disk on the week of 4-10 September 2017 it
produced four X-class ﬂares, including the two strongest of the
cycle, 27 M-class ﬂares, and numerous more of smaller size, as
the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)
soft X-ray (0.1 − 0.8 nm) light curve of Fig. 1 depicts.

A few of these ﬂares also produced coronal mass ejections
(CMEs). Of the three halo CMEs, two were Earth-directed and
geoeﬀective (Chertok et al. 2018), while one of them led to par-
ticle acceleration at the produced shock front (Morosan et al.
2019), and also to a ground-level enhancement of energetic par-
ticles (Augusto et al. 2019). This particle event originated from
an X8.2 ﬂare and its associated CME of 10 September 2017
(Veronig et al. 2018), when AR 12673 was crossing the west
solar limb.

Most of the interest in the activity of AR 12673 was fo-
cused however on the two X-class ﬂares of 6 September 2017;
the conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare that started at 08:57 UT (SOL2017-09-
06T08:57), and the eruptive X9.3 ﬂare, the largest since 2005,
that followed three hours after the ﬁrst, at 11:53 UT (SOL2017-
09-06T11:53). In this work, we are interested in a 10-hours time
interval centered around the X2.2 ﬂare of 6 September that also
includes the X9.3 ﬂare.

The photospheric morphology of AR 12673 started as a sin-
gle positive-polarity sunspot and quickly became quite compli-
cated, displaying a complex network of δ-sunspots. It exhibited
signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence and the highest instantaneous ﬂux
rate ever observed (Sun & Norton 2017), with values reaching
up to 1021 Mx hr−1 during the third of September, as Fig. 1 also
shows. Many dipoles emerged close to the initial sunspot and the
successive interactions between them resulted in the increased
complexity of the system.

The magnetic ﬁeld of the AR as measured by the Helioseis-
mic and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al. 2012) instru-
ment onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (Pesnell et al.
2012) was very strong, especially along the polarity inversion
line (Wang et al. 2018). Photospheric shearing and twisting mo-
tions were also observed (Verma 2018), which helped in the cre-

study, which is shown zoomed in at the bottom. The purple bands in

ation of the highly non-potential conﬁguration that powered the
two ﬂares.

Many models were invoked in order to explain the evolution
of AR 12673 towards the two X-class ﬂares and the eruption
of the second. Yang et al. (2017) associated the increased ﬂare-
productivity of the AR with the blocking of newly emerging ﬂux
by already existing ﬂux, and the eruptive ﬂare with a ﬁlament be-
coming kink unstable. The formation of a coronal sigmoid and
the initiation of both X-class ﬂares from the core of the sigmoid,
led Mitra et al. (2018) to characterize the AR as a single “sig-
moid–to–arcade” event.

Hou et al. (2018) attributted the generation of the two ﬂares
to the formation of multiple ﬂux ropes and twisted loop bundles
that eventually erupted. The presence of a large, highly-twisted
magnetic ﬂux rope, and some smaller ones, was also conﬁrmed
by the MHD modelling of the X9.3 ﬂare of AR 12673 made by
Inoue et al. (2018).

The highly-twisted ﬂux ropes that were found by many au-
thors indicate that magnetic helicity should be an important fac-
tor in the eruptivity of AR 12673. Indeed, Liu et al. (2018) have
found a signiﬁcant enhancement, by almost a factor of three, of

Moraitis et al.: Magnetic helicity and eruptivity in AR 12673

the magnetic helicity during the conﬁned X2.2 ﬂare, although
they approximated helicity only with its twist. In another study,
Yan et al. (2018) did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant change of helicity dur-
ing the ﬁrst X-class ﬂare, but only a small decrease during the
second. They found however a negative helicity injection rate
throughout the day of the two ﬂares, consistent with the rota-
tional motions of the sunspots in AR 12673.

The sign of magnetic helicity was actually negative for the
whole week of the AR’s activity, as was deduced by integrating
the helicity injection rate (Vemareddy 2019). The same author
found that AR 12673 exhibited very fast helicity injection, by a
factor of three higher compared to other ARs when it was nor-
malized to the square of magnetic ﬂux.

All these support the choice of AR 12673 as an interesting
case to study the evolution of the helicity ratio in an observed
AR. The question we want to address is whether this evolution
relates with the eruptivity of the AR, as proposed by Pariat et al.
(2017). Apart from |Hj|/|H|, we are also interested in examining
the evolution of all helicity-, and energy-related budgets of the
AR. For determining all quantites of interest, the coronal mag-
netic ﬁeld must ﬁrst be estimated. The method we followed for
this is described in Section 2. The results that we obtained are
presented in Section 3, and they are then discussed in Section 4.

2. Method

This section describes the method we followed to compute all
magnetic helicities and energies in AR 12673. We ﬁrst describe
the non-linear force-free (NLFF) ﬁeld extrapolation method that
we used in order to approximate the coronal magnetic ﬁeld of the
AR. Then, we check that the produced coronal ﬁelds are suitable
for use with the helicity computation method, which we brieﬂy
describe afterwards.

2.1. Coronal ﬁeld modelling

The starting point of all computations performed in this work
were magnetic ﬁeld data from the HMI instrument of SDO.
We used the vector magnetogram data with 12 minutes cadence
(product hmi.sharp_720s). The actual cadence of the data var-
ied during the interval of interest due to an eclipse of the ob-
servatory and a few low-quality data during the two ﬂares. The
morphology of the Bz-distribution on the photosphere at the be-
ginning and at the end of the 10-hours interval of study is shown
in Fig. 2.

The next step was to model the 3D magnetic ﬁeld of AR
12673 in a ﬁnite volume above the AR with a NLFF ﬁeld extrap-
olation method. Such methods try to simultaneously satisfy the
force-free, and the solenoidal conditions for the magnetic ﬁeld,
which read

(∇ × B) × B = 0
∇ · B = 0.

(6)
(7)

The unavoidable presence of numerical errors in the solution
process hinders the exact fullﬁlment of these conditions. The
solenoidal condition is thus never fully constrained in a NLFF
extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld. The level of non-solenoidality is
however very important for the helicity computations. Valori
et al. (2016) have showed that the values of helicity are unreli-
able when the non-solenoidality errors are above a certain level.
It is therefore essential to estimate the level of solenoidality of
the given magnetic ﬁeld when computing relative magnetic he-
licity, which we do with two ways, as described in Sect. 2.2.

Fig. 2. Photospheric distribution of Bz in AR 12673 at the beginning, top
plot at 04:12 UT, and the end of our study interval, bottom plot at 13:36
UT. Blue contours correspond to Bz = −500 G, and red to Bz = 500 G.

A possible way to optimize the 3D magnetic ﬁeld model with
respect to its divergence-freeness is to perform diﬀerent extrap-
olations and then to keep the best-performing one. In this work
we estimated the magnetic ﬁeld of AR 12673 using two diﬀer-
ent NLFF methods. The investigation of the various parameters
in each method was not exhaustive since our goal was to have a
reliable magnetic ﬁeld for the helicity computations and not to
determine it with the highest possible accuracy.

The ﬁrst extrapolation method that we used was the opti-
mization method of Wiegelmann (2004, hereafter W04). This
tries to minimize a functional so that to fullﬁl the divergence-
, and force-free conditions, given by Eqs. 6, 7. We note at this
point that the assumption that the magnetic ﬁeld is force-free is
not always true, especially near the photosphere, and during so-
lar ﬂares. For this, the magnetograms were ﬁrst preprocessed so
that to become more compatible with the force-free assumption
(Wiegelmann et al. 2006) with the standard set of preprocess-
ing parameters [µ1, µ2, µ3, µ4] = [1, 1, 10−3, 10−2], in the authors’
original notation.

The resolution used in the extrapolations was 1", or 720 km,
while the grid size was 320×320×320 pixels. The computational
volume consisted of the volume of interest surrounded by a
boundary buﬀer layer in the lateral and top boundaries with 16
pixels on each side. In the helicity computations only the in-
ner, physical part of the ﬁelds were kept, after further cutting in
height, at roughly the 2/3 of the total height. The ﬁnal datacubes

A&A proofs: manuscript no. paper-text

thus consisted of 288×288×203 pixels. The total snapshots were
28, covering 10 hours starting from 6 September, 04:00 UT.

The second extrapolation method that we used was the newer
version of the same optimization code (Wiegelmann et al. 2012,
hereafter W12), which usually performs better. The idea of W12
is to add another term to the functional of W04 so that to take
into account the uncertainties in the measurements of the pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬁeld components. This is done by weighting
each pixel separately according to its uncertainty. In this study
we used the actual HMI measurement uncertainties for the ﬁrst
time. The empirical weighting function that we employed was:

(cid:40)

w =

0.01 + 0.99 exp
0.01,

(cid:17)

(cid:16)
− σB
0.03B

,

pixels with B ≥ 200 G
pixels with B < 200 G

.

(8)

Here B denotes the magnetic ﬁeld strength at a pixel on the pho-
tosphere, and σB its uncertainty. We assumed a value of 200 G
for the typical noise threshold, and 0.03 for the typical value
of σB/B. This choice sharply de-emphasizes the contribution of
bad measurements in several strong ﬁeld regions.

All remaining parameters were the same as in the W04 case,
except from the size of the buﬀer which was 32 pixels in this
case. The ﬁnal datacubes were thus 256×256×203 pixels. The
number of snapshots were also smaller in this case, 18 instead
of 28, but with the same coverage until the ﬁrst ﬂare. The mor-
phology of the 3D magnetic ﬁeld for the two cases and for the
same snapshot is shown in Fig. 3. We note that the two cases
exhibit many diﬀerences in morphology. The morphology of the
magnetic ﬁeld evolves during the ﬂares, following the evolution
of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld.

extrapolation methods (W04 to the top, W12 to the bottom). The same
footpoints were used in both cases. Field lines are colored according to
the magnitude of the electrical current density.

We ﬁnally note that we checked other cases for the ex-
trapolation parameters also, such as diﬀerent µ3 and/or µ4 pre-
processing parameters in W04, diﬀerent binning in W04, and
diﬀerent weighting of the various terms in the functional of W12.
None of these cases produced better results however, and so we
presented here the two most accurate cases.

2.2. Solenoidality level estimation

The resulting magnetic ﬁelds were then tested for their quality
with respect to how divergence-, and force-free they were. A tra-
ditional way to quantify the divergence-freeness of a magnetic
ﬁeld is through the average absolute fractional ﬂux increase,
(cid:104)| fi|(cid:105), (Wheatland et al. 2000). This parameter expresses the av-
erage of the local non-solenoidalities in the volume of interest;
the smaller it is the more solenoidal the ﬁeld is. The level of
divergence-freeness in the W04 case was quite high with a mean
value over all the 28 snapshots of (cid:104)| fi|(cid:105) = (5.9 ± 0.5) × 10−4.
The respective values for the W12 set were slightly better, with
a mean value over all 18 snapshots of (cid:104)| fi|(cid:105) = (5.3 ± 0.6) × 10−4.
We also tested the level of force-freeness of the extrapo-
lated ﬁelds with an angle, θJ, that expresses the average current-
weighted angle between the current and the magnetic ﬁeld
(Wheatland et al. 2000). The mean value we found for the W04
magnetic ﬁelds was θJ = (16.8±2.6)o, typical for this method. In
the W12 case, the force-freeness level was again slightly better,
with an average angle θJ = (15.1 ± 1.5)o.

Another parameter that indicates the divergence-freeness of
a magnetic ﬁeld is the energy ratio Ediv/E, originally used by
Valori et al. (2016). It expresses the fraction of the total energy
that is related to all the (numerical) non-solenoidalities of the
magnetic ﬁeld. To derive the mathematical expresion for Ediv one
needs to decompose the magnetic ﬁeld into potential and current-
carrying components, B = Bp + Bj, and then split each compo-
nent into solenoidal and non-solenoidal parts, Bp = Bp,s + Bp,ns,
and Bj = Bj,s + Bj,ns, following Valori et al. (2013). By deﬁning
the energy budget of each component through the relation

Ex = 1
8π

(cid:90)

V

x dV,

(9)

we end up with the following decomposition for the total energy
of the given magnetic ﬁeld

E = Ep,s + Ep,ns + Ej,s + Ej,ns + Emix,

(10)

with Emix the energy corresponding to all the cross terms. A non-
negative energy associated to all non-solenoidal components of
the magnetic ﬁeld can then be deﬁned by the quantity

Ediv = Ep,ns + Ej,ns + |Emix|.

(11)

It is an upper limit to the non-solenoidal energy since the abso-
lute value of Emix, the only signed term in the decomposition of
Eq. 10, is considered. A perfectly solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld has
Ep,ns = Ej,ns = Emix = 0, and thus also Ediv = 0; the larger the
values of Ediv are, the more non-solenoidal it gets. Valori et al.
(2016) have showed that when Ediv/E exceeds ∼ 8 − 9%, then
the values of helicity become unreliable.

Since the energy ratio Ediv/E is important for helicity com-
putations we focused more on this quantity. We calculated all
components in the energy decomposition following Valori et al.
(2013), and we show in Fig. 4 the evolution of Ediv/E for the two
sets of extrapolated magnetic ﬁelds that we used. Also shown is
the condition Ediv/E = 0.08 which, according to Valori et al.

3. Results

The evolution of relative magnetic helicity and its two compo-
nents in AR 12673 is shown in the top panel of Fig. 5. We notice
that relative magnetic helicity is negative, in agreement with pre-
vious studies, and that all helicity budgets are also negative. The
absolute values of relative magnetic helicity are very high, and
reach up to 5 × 1043 Mx2, mostly because of the high magnetic
ﬂux of the AR. The current-carrying component of helicity is
much smaller than the other two helicities, as was also found in
other cases (e.g., Moraitis et al. 2014). The evolution patterns
are similar for all helicities, increasing before the ﬁrst ﬂare, re-
laxing after it, then again increasing before the second ﬂare and
relaxing afterwards.

The bottom panel of Fig. 5 shows the helicity budgets nor-
malized to the square of the magnetic ﬂux, Φ, which is calculated
from the Bz maps of the NLFF ﬁelds as Φ = 1
|Bz|dS . The
2
normalized helicity exhibits much more typical values compared
to the helicity in physical units, conﬁrming that the high values
of helicity are due to the high ﬂux. This plot reveals another fea-
ture of the helicities evolution. The normalized helicities have
a much smoother evolution compared to the regular helicities
before the ﬁrst X-class ﬂare, while afterwards both behave simi-
larly. This could mean that the rise of the helicity budgets before
the ﬁrst ﬂare are related to the increase of the ﬂux then, but the
later ﬂuctuations are purely ﬂare-related.

(2016), discriminates between magnetic ﬁelds that lead to reli-
able values of helicity and those that do not.

We note that the energy ratio in the W04 case performs
well until the ﬁrst X-class ﬂare with values around the limit
Ediv/E = 0.08, but all snapshots after the ﬁrst ﬂare have much
higher values. On the contrary, most of the snapshots in the W12
case are well below the limit, with the exception of three points;
the two right before the ﬁrst ﬂare, and the one after the second
ﬂare. Additionally, the values of the energy ratio for the W12
ﬁelds are much lower than the W04 ones except from the two
points before the ﬁrst ﬂare. Therefore, we kept in the following
computations the best-performing snapshots of the W12 method,
except from the two snapshots before the ﬁrst ﬂare which were
replaced by the W04 ones that are better, and the snapshot af-
ter the second ﬂare where both methods are above the limit and
were thus discarded.

2.3. Magnetic helicity and energy computations

For each snapshot in the ﬁnal dataset we computed relative mag-
netic helicity from its deﬁnition, Eq. 1, and also the two gauge-
independent components that it splits into, Eqs. 4, and 5. All
the helicities of interest were computed following the method
of Moraitis et al. (2014). Brieﬂy, this method ﬁrst calculates the
potential magnetic ﬁeld that satisﬁes Eq. 2 so that the relative
magnetic helicity given by Eq. 1 is gauge independent. The po-
tential ﬁeld is obtained from the numerical solution of Laplace’s
equation with pure Neumann boundary conditions. The two vec-
tor potentials are then computed following the recipe of Val-
ori et al. (2012), which makes the clever choice for the gauges,
Az = Ap,z = 0, that results in the straightforward integration of
the equations.

We were also interested in the evolution of the various energy
budgets of the AR; the total ﬁeld energy, E, the potential energy,
Ep, including any non-solenoidal contribution it may have, and
the free energy, Ef = E − Ep. For a perfectly solenoidal magnetic
ﬁeld this free energy coincides with Ej,s as deduced from Eq. 10,
and deviates from it proportionally to the value of Ediv.

A&A proofs: manuscript no. paper-text

very high values due to the high magnetic ﬂux of the AR. We
notice that the energy of the potential ﬁeld changes only slightly
during the 10 hours of our study, as a consequence of the modest
evolution of the normal ﬁeld on the boundary that is evident in
Fig. 2. The change of the normal ﬁeld is less than that in the hor-
izontal ﬁeld however, which developed extensive kilogauss bald
patches during this period (Sun et al., in preparation). We also
note that, although not directly comparable, the evolution pattern
of Ep is quite diﬀerent that the one of Hpj, despite that both quan-
tities involve the potential ﬁeld. As a result of the small change
of the potential energy, free energy and total ﬁeld energy show
very similar evolution patterns. Moreover, this pattern resembles
the one of the helicities, increasing before the ﬂares, and relaxing
afterwards.

The local maximum of the energy ratio before the second ﬂare
is however much weaker compared to the corresponding local
maximum of the helicity ratio. We note in Fig. 7 that free energy,
from the peak of ∼ 34% of the total energy before the ﬁrst ﬂare,
it drops to ∼ 25% between the two ﬂares, and ﬁnally to ∼ 15%
after the second. Diﬀerently than the helicity ratio therefore, the
energy ratio cannot be used to set a threshold above which ﬂares
occur.

4. Discussion

This paper dealt with the detailed study of the helicity and en-
ergy properties of AR 12673 at the time around its two consecu-
tive X-class ﬂares of 6 September 2017. All involved quantities
were accurately computed for the whole period of intense activ-
ity, for the ﬁrst time in such detail. The computations followed
a recent ﬁnite volume method, and the careful modelling of the
3D magnetic ﬁeld of the AR.

In the latter, the coronal magnetic ﬁeld was extrapolated with
two diﬀerent versions of an optimization-based NLFF method.
In the newer version of the method, an observationally-derived,
empirical weighting that employs the HMI uncertainty estimate
was used, for the ﬁrst time on such methods. This version turned
out to be the most accurate, as deduced by a parameter that dis-
criminates extrapolations leading to reliable helicity values from
those that do not, but not in all the cases examined. The older
version performed better in two snapshots right before the ﬁrst
X-class ﬂare. The best-performing NLFF ﬁelds from the two
methods were compiled into the ﬁnal dataset used.

In a very recent work (Thalmann et al. 2019) the authors sug-
gest that the threshold in the parameter Ediv/E should be lower
that the one used in this work, 5% instead of 8%, for a NLFF
ﬁeld to be used in helicity studies. We expect to see diﬀerences
of the order of 4 − 5% to the derived helicities with such a NLFF
ﬁeld, as follows from Valori et al. (2016, Section 7), and so our
results should not be aﬀected by such a change.

The modelling of the magnetic ﬁeld enabled us to follow the
evolution of the relative magnetic helicity and its two compo-
nents, the non-potential, and the volume-threading one, in AR
12673. The negative sign of all helicity components conﬁrmed
the ﬁndings of other authors. The values of relative helicity that

onset times at 08:57 UT and 11:53 UT, respectively. Filled points cor-

The main purpose of this work was to examine whether an
observed eruptive AR is compatible with the results of Pariat
et al. (2017) and Zuccarello et al. (2018), that the helicity ratio
|Hj|/|H| can indicate AR eruptivity. The evolution of this quan-
tity for AR 12673 is shown in Fig. 7. We note that |Hj|/|H| in-
creases before the two X-class ﬂares and drops after them. The
maximum values of the helicity ratio are |Hj|/|H| (cid:39) 0.20 right
before the ﬁrst X-ﬂare, and |Hj|/|H| (cid:39) 0.17 before the second.
Additionally, these two local maxima are the highest values in
the helicity ratio time variation. In other words, a threshold in
the value of |Hj|/|H| can be identiﬁed from Fig. 7 (red dotted
line) above which ﬂares occur. Of course, the exact value of this
threshold could depend on the conditions of the speciﬁc AR and
it should be further examined whether a universal threshold ex-
ists or not. This result seems to be in agreement with the ﬁnding
of Pariat et al. (2017) that |Hj|/|H| attains its highest values be-
fore eruptions. Moreover, the ratio |Hj|/|H| rises again at the end
of our study interval, possibly indicating the subsequent activity
of AR 12673.

Figure 7 also displays the evolution of the ratio of free energy
to total energy, Ef/E, in AR 12673. This parameter has also been
examined by Pariat et al. (2017) and Zuccarello et al. (2018),
and it was found to be less indicative of eruptivity compared to
|Hj|/|H|. The energy ratio evolution pattern that we ﬁnd exhibits
some similarities to the helicity ratio one, which could be a re-
sult of the relation between free energy and relative magnetic
helicity magnitude (Tziotziou et al. 2012; Tziotziou et al. 2014).

we estimate are similar in magnitude with those reported by
Vemareddy (2019), reaching up to −5 × 1043 Mx2. They were
however three orders of magnitude higher than those of Yan
et al. (2018), although both cited works used the ﬂux integration
method for computing helicity. Compared to Liu et al. (2018),
our helicity values are again much larger, but these authors ap-
proximated helicity only with its twist, and so the diﬀerence is
reasonable. The change of helicity during the ﬁrst ﬂare that we
found was also much smaller than theirs.

Additionally, we examined the evolution of the various en-
ergy budgets in AR 12673. The evolution pattern of the free en-
ergy that we derived seems to agree with Mitra et al. (2018),
although a direct comparison is not possible since the authors
provide only the ratio Ef/Ep. The ﬁeld energy that we derive,
which is as high as 2.5 × 1033 erg, compares also well with that
of Vemareddy (2019) that is computed as the sum of the accu-
mulated energy in the system.

The focus of this work was the examination of the behaviour
of the helicity ratio |Hj|/|H| during the two ﬂares. This ﬁrst ob-
servational determination of the evolution of this ratio in an AR
seems to conﬁrm the ﬁndings of Pariat et al. (2017); the helic-
ity ratio increases before major ﬂares, and it relaxes afterwards.
Moreover, the much smaller current-carrying part of helicity, i.e.,
the fact that |Hj|/|H| < 1, is in agreement with previous results
(Moraitis et al. 2014). Also, the examination of the energy ratio
Ef/E is compatible with the results of Pariat et al. (2017) and
Zuccarello et al. (2018); this ratio relates also to AR eruptivity,
but to a smaller extent than |Hj|/|H|, and without the capability
of providing a threshold above which ﬂares occur, unlike the he-
licity ratio.

In order to establish these results, the evolution of the he-
licity ratio should be examined in a large number of ARs, with
diﬀerent characteristics regarding their evolutionary stage and/or
their eruptivity, and with the highest possible cadence. A step to-
wards this direction is made with the work of Thalmann et al. (in
preparation). The present paper nevertheless, provides the ﬁrst
observational support to the relation of the helicity ratio |Hj|/|H|
with solar eruptivity.
