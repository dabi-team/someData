We propose a Hamiltonian dynamics formalism for the current and magnetic ﬁeld driven dynamics of ferro-
magnetic and antiferromagnetic domain walls in one dimensional systems. To demonstrate the power of this
formalism, we derive Hamilton equations of motion via Poisson brackets based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
phenomenology, and add dissipative dynamics via the evolution of the energy. We use this approach to study
current induced domain wall motion and compute the drift velocity. For the antiferromagnetic case, we show
that a nonzero magnetic moment is induced in the domain wall, which indicates that an additional application
of a magnetic ﬁeld would inﬂuence the antiferromagnetic domain-wall dynamics. We consider both cases of the
magnetic ﬁeld being parallel and transverse to the N´eel ﬁeld. Based on this formalism, we predict an orientation
switch mechanism for antiferromagnetic domain walls which can be tested with the recently discovered N´eel
spin orbit torques.

INTRODUCTION

The insensitivity of antiferromagnets (AFM) to external
magnetic ﬁelds, together with their inherent faster dynamics,
affords these materials a technological advantage over their
ferromagnetic (FM) counterparts [1, 2]. However, the mag-
netic invisibility is responsible also for the difﬁculty in detect-
ing and manipulating spin-textures that can store information
in such materials. Making antiferromagnetic active compo-
nents in spintronic devices is the focus of the emerging ﬁeld
of antiferromagnetic spintronics [3, 4]. This emerging ﬁeld
has seen a lot of recent progress in experimental techniques
[5–10], which has led to a raise in theoretical studies of the
dynamics of AFM domain walls (DW) and other AFM spin
textures [11–25]. Describing effectively the dynamics of these
textures is a vital goal to connect experimental observables to
the AFM textures and their dynamics.

The analysis of FM DW dynamics in terms of a ﬁnite set of
parameters have been considered recently in Refs. [26, 27].
The results obtained from such description based on a ﬁnite
set of collective coordinates representing soft modes agree
with experimental and numerical data. In this paper we show
that, under some conditions, it is possible to combine such
soft modes in terms of conjugated parameters and a Hamil-
tonian dynamics description. We apply this procedure to the
electrical current and magnetic ﬁeld driven dynamics of both
FM and AFM DWs in nanowires. We derive the form of the
effective Hamiltonian for DW dynamics based on the symme-
tries of the problem alone due to the transparent Hamiltonian
structure of the effective equations of motion.

A strength of the Hamiltonian dynamics formalism pro-
vided in this paper is that it is insensitive to the details of the
microscopic magnetic Hamiltonian. This aspect makes this
formalism very powerful and rich as one can easily, with a few
assumptions, study many known aspects of AFM DW dynam-
ics and also include various interactions. Moreover, within the

spirit of a phase space given by the conjugated soft modes, we
may consider interactions and scattering of DWs, as well as
thermodynamic effects. As an application of the developed
formalism, we will show that it is capable of describing: i)
current-induced dynamics for both FM and AFM DWs, ii)
magnetic ﬁeld induced dynamics for both FM and AFM DWs,
iii) orientation switching by current for AFM DWs. The orien-
tation switching mechanism is a novel feature for AFM DWs
which is naturally derived within our approach. The switch of
conﬁgurations on antiferromagnets may have several applica-
tions to magnetic memory devices [28]. We also show below
that other effects such as different anisotropies, nanowire in-
homogeneity, etc., can be incorporated within the same for-
malism.

The paper is structured as follows. We will ﬁrst describe
the highly non linear dynamics of the magnetization ﬁeld.
We then deﬁne a simpler FM DW description through the
use of proper canonical Hamiltonian variables. After deriv-
ing the Hamilton equations of motion for the spin polarized
current driven FM DW in the dissipationless case, we show
how the dissipation must be included in these equations. We
also demonstrate how the form of the effective DW Hamilto-
nian can be understood from the symmetries of the problem.
Finally, we apply this formalism to the case of AFM DWs,
solve certain general cases for AFM DW dynamics, and make
proposals for future AFM DW experiments.

EFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN DESCRIPTION

In the absence of spin-orbit torques (SOT) [29–38] the mag-
netization dynamics of a FM due to magnetic ﬁelds and elec-
tric current is described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)
equation [39, 40]:

˙(cid:126)m = γ0 (cid:126)m ×

δHm
δ (cid:126)m

− J∂ (cid:126)m + α (cid:126)m × ˙(cid:126)m + β (cid:126)m × (J∂ (cid:126)m), (1)

Hamiltonian equations of motion. To do so we calculate the
Poisson brackets for two parameters of this object.

The Poisson brackets of the unit vector (cid:126)m, a representation

of SO(3), are

{mi(x), mj(x(cid:48))} = (cid:15)ijkmk(x)δ(x − x(cid:48)).

(3)

The magnetization conﬁguration (cid:126)m(x) of a single DW in a
nanowire may be described in terms of the soft modes X, the
position of the domain wall, and φ, the rotation of magneti-
zation at the DW center around the nanowire axis, see Fig. 1.
A variation of the conﬁguration in terms of these parameters
corresponds to

dmi(x) = −dX∂mi(x) + dφ(cid:15)ijkejmk(x),

(4)

where (cid:126)e is the unit vector along the wire. Comparing the total
volume of the phase space in terms of (cid:126)m and variables X and
φ, we ﬁnd

{X, φ} = ±1,

(5)

where the + and − signs are for the tail-to-tail and head-to-
head DWs, respectively [43]. Note that for a FM DW, the
DW position X and the angle φ are canonically conjugated
Hamiltonian variables independent of the microscopic form
of the Hamiltonian.

Let us now consider the dependence of the total magnetic
energy on time. As the Hamiltonian does not depend explic-
itly on time, we can write
(cid:90)

˙E =

δHm
δmi(x)

˙midx

(6)

and substitute Eq. (1) for ˙(cid:126)m. Upon doing this we notice that
only one of the terms is not dissipative, −J (cid:82) δHm
δmi(x) ∂midx =
J∂X E, where X is the DW center coordinate. The remaining
terms are ﬁrst order in dissipation. Using (cid:15)ijkmj
= ˙mi +
J∂mi we ﬁnd

δHm
δmk

˙E − J∂X E = −

(cid:90)

( ˙mi + J∂mi)(α ˙mi + βJ∂mi)dx.

(7)

First we consider the dissipationless dynamics, where we
set α = β = 0. We obtain then the equation of Hamiltonian
dynamics ˙E = J∂X E. Therefore, there exists an effective
˙E = {E, H} = J∂X E. In
Hamiltonian H(X, φ) such that
the absence of current, the Hamiltonian must be equal to the
magnetic energy E(X, φ) of the DW, and thus we conclude

H(X, φ) = E(X, φ) ± Jφ,

(8)

˙E. This energy function
as this Hamiltonian gives the correct
is all one needs to know to obtain the effective equations of
motion for the FM DW.

The Hamiltonian equations for the coordinates X and φ

take the form

FIG. 1. A sketch of ferromagnetic tail-to-tail domain wall. X and
φ denote the position and the tilt angle of the DW. J corresponds to
the injected spin polarized current. We assume the polarization of J
follows (cid:126)m.

where (cid:126)m2 = 1 is the unitary vector along the magnetization,
γ0 is the gyromagnetic constant, the spatial derivative ∂ is
along the nanowire, Hm is a magnetic Hamiltonian, α is the
Gilbert constant damping, and β is a dimensionless damping
parameter. J corresponds to the spin-polarized current along
the nanowire, with the amplitude given by

J =

jP gµB
2eMs

,

(2)

where j is the current density, P is the polarization of the
current, and Ms is the saturation magnetization. The current,
α, and β terms generally depend on the microscopic details of
the full system. In particular, the dissipative α and β terms de-
pend on the strength and nature of the magnetization-electron
and magnetization-phonon interactions. However, we assume
locality (both in space and time) of the dissipative effects. The
symmetry demands a speciﬁc form of the the dissipative terms
and the current interaction. As the current, α, and β terms
couple with the variation of the magnetization, at the scales
of the magnetization conﬁgurations considered on this paper,
only linear terms of these couplings are relevant. We also as-
sume here the isotropic form of all current, α and β terms,
although this requirement can be violated in some materials.
Nevertheless, generally the LLG equation has been shown to
describe magnetization dynamics well in many different ma-
terials, see e.g. Ref. 41.

The magnetic Hamiltonian Hm includes all interactions for
the local magnetization in the ferromagnet, such as the ex-
change interaction and all the magnetic anisotropies. It may
also include Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, dipole-dipole, and other
interaction terms. We assume that Hm does not explicitly de-
pend on time.

Domain wall motion in a ferromagnet

A typical transverse DW in a ferromagnetic nanowire is
well approximated by a rigid object, which can move along
and rotate around the wire axis [42]. During this motion the
DW shape changes a little, since in the presence of anisotropy
the modes corresponding to the change of the DW shape are
gapped. Here we derive the dynamics of the DW based on the

Next, we include dissipative terms γX and γφ in these equa-
tions:

˙X = {X, H} + γX ,

˙φ = {φ, H} + γφ.

(10)

To calculate the dissipative terms, we expand Eq. (7) for the
DW motion to the linear order in J

˙E − J∂X E = −α ˙X 2∆−1

X + 2α ˙φ ˙XΓ − α ˙φ2∆φ

+(α + β)J ˙X∆−1

X − (α + β) ˙φJΓ, (11)

where the constants are deﬁned as
(cid:90)

X =

and Γ =

They are the parameters determining the DW dynamics and
depend on the DW shape. For a planar DW, when the mag-
netic Hamiltonian has no Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term [42],
the constant Γ vanishes, Γ = 0.

We compare now Eq. (11) to the same expression we com-
˙φ, and

˙E − J∂X E = ∓Jγφ ± γφ ˙X ∓ γX

puted using (10),
ﬁnd for the dissipative terms

γφ = ∓α ˙X∆−1
X ± βJ∆−1
X ,
γX = ±α ˙φ∆φ ∓ 2α ˙XΓ ± (α + β)JΓ.

(12)

(13)

We note that Eqs. (10), together with the constants γX and γφ
deﬁned above, completely determine the DW dynamics in a
ferromagnetic nanowire in terms of α, β, and the parameters
of the magnetic Hamiltonian.
In particular, many previous
results on ferromagnetic DW dynamics [26, 42, 44–46] can
be easily obtained within this formalism.

We emphasize that although in this paper we assume the
direction of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy to be along the
nanowire, this description is valid for any other anisotropy di-
rection. The angle φ is then just the angle of the central spin in
the DW, which rotates around the anisotropy axis. In the case
of anisotropy axis perpendicular to the nanowire this angle
describes the oscillations between the Bloch and N´eel DWs.

Domain wall motion in an antiferromagnet

Below we show how to extend the Hamiltonian formalism
of DW dynamics to the important case of AFM DW. Both the-
oretical and experimental studies [5–14, 18–24] of the AFM
dynamics have been very active recently due to improved
experimental capabilities to detect, produce, and manipulate
these systems. However, a more systematic approach to the
motion of AFM DWs is still missing and here we make an
attempt to ﬁll in this gap.

We consider a collinear AFM on a bipartite lattice with sub-
lattices A and B. A typical nanowire is quasi one-dimensional
from the point of view of magnetization and magnetization
dynamics, but still is three-dimensional from the point of view

FIG. 2. A sketch of antiferromagnetic domain wall. The AFM
DW is a composite object consisting of two ferromagnetic DWs on
two sublattices (A and B) with respective position XA (XB) and the
tilt angle of the ferromagnetic DW φA (φB) on respective sublattice.
One ferromagnetic DW is tail-to-tail (A) and the other is head-to-
head (B). The inset shows the AFM lattice with up- and down-spin
sublattices and nearest (second nearest) neighbor hopping constants

of the electronic degrees of freedom. An electron has hop-
ping matrix elements both between the nearest neighbors and
between next nearest neighbors on the lattice.
In the pres-
ence of the AFM order in the case of large on-site electron
spin-magnetization interaction the hopping between the near-
est neighbors – between a site of sublattice A and a nearest
site in sublattice B – is suppressed, while the hoping between
the next nearest neighbors – the sites of the same sublattice –
is unaffected. Thus, we can assume that each electron lives on
its own sublattice and interacts only with the magnetization
of the same sublattice. A hybrid systems of bilayer materi-
als, i.e. what is known as an artiﬁcial antiferromagnet, where
both layers have ferromagnetic in-layer order coupled anti-
ferromagnetically to each other is a good example of such a
description.

In the presence of an AFM DW this separation of the elec-
trons to different sublattices is not perfect, but under the as-
sumption that the DW width is much larger than the electronic
coherence length, the corrections to this picture are expected
to be small. It is important to note that, if there is a percola-
tion within each sublattice, the potential difference across the
wire is the same on both sublattices, however the resistivity
of each of them does not have to be the same. Thus the elec-
trical currents on the two sublattices can be different. This
case is especially crucial in the situation where the sublattices
are made of different atoms, as it is on some hybrid systems.
To simplify the equations, however, we assume that, given the
assumptions of the scales considered, the currents on the two
sublattices are the same [47].

The above described situation leads to the following pic-
ture. A single AFM DW is composed of two coupled FM
DWs on each of the sublattices with its own current. One of
the DWs is tail-to-tail (DW on sublattice A in Fig. 2) and the
other one is head-to-head. We thus introduce two sets of vari-

ables, XA and φA for the head-to-head DW on sublattice A
and XB and φB for the tail-to-tail DW on sublattice B. To
simplify the expressions below we assume that the DW pa-
rameters ∆φ, ∆X , α, and β are the same for the two DWs,
and that the DWs are planar, i.e. Γ = 0.

The magnetic Hamiltonian depends now on the two sets of
coordinates H(XA, φA, XB, φB). The center of the DW is
at X = 1
2 (XA + XB). The value of XA − XB gives the
magnetization of the AFM DW along the nanowire. φB − φA
is the angle between the directions of the spins at the center
of the DWs. It corresponds to the magnetic moment of the
AFM DW perpendicular to the AFM DW plane. The coupled
equations of motion are:

and thus depends on the two sets of coordinates. In a trans-
lationally invariant nanowire the energy E is independent of
XA + XB. However, in the problems for the DW dynamics in
a nanowire with a non-uniform shape [46], one should add a
term Ω(X 2
B)/2 to the energy E, where Ω is a constant
inversely proportional to the nanowire curvature.

A + X 2

One can write the function E(XA, φA, XB, φB) in a very
general form. We notice that the minimum of the total AFM
DW energy is reached at XA − XB = 0 and φA − φB = π.
Expanding for small |XA − XB| and the ﬁrst harmonic of the
angular dependence, we ﬁnd

E(XA, φA, XB, φB) =

change constant. One also can add a transverse anisotropy
by adding K(sin2 φA + sin2 φB) to the energy.

Using the Hamiltonian (16) with energy (17) to calculate

the Poisson brackets, we obtain

the current through this material would lead to the rotation of
the AFM DW as in the case of a ferromagnetic DW above the
Walker breakdown. In this paper we assume that the easy-axis
magnetic anisotropy is along the wire, and the magnetic ﬁeld
h in the above equations is also along the wire – along the
anisotropy axis. However, the general formalism is valid for
any direction of the anisotropy after a trivial change of nota-
tions.

The equations of motion (18) and (19) are one of our main
results. They provide the dynamics of AFM DW interacting
with both magnetic ﬁeld h and electrical current J. These two
interactions may be studied independently.

Current induced AFM DW dynamics.- Many aspects of
the current driven dynamics of magnetization conﬁgurations
in antiferromagnetic is well known, see for example Refs.
[15, 16, 23, 25, 28]. We show that some results may be eas-
ily derived within the Hamiltonian formalism. From Eqs. (18)
– (19) we consider next the case with no magnetic ﬁeld, i.e.
h = 0, and

˙XA − ˙XB = −α( ˙φA + ˙φB)∆φ,
˙φA + ˙φA = 2∆1(XA − XB) +

(20)
( ˙XA − ˙XB). (21)

α
∆X

As ˙XA − ˙XB is already ﬁrst order in the dissipation, the sec-
ond term on the right-hand side (RHS) of Eq. (21) should be
dropped. Then, by substituting Eq. (21) into (20) we obtain,

˙XA − ˙XB = −2α∆φ∆1(XA − XB).

(22)

It has an exponentially decaying solution for XA − XB ∝
exp(−2α∆φ∆1t) and thus in the steady state ˙φA = − ˙φB.
We also obtain the other two equations from the system (18) -
(19):

˙φA − ˙φB =

J,

˙X = ∆2 sin(φA − φB) − α∆φ

+ J.

Similarly ˙φA − ˙φB is already of the ﬁrst order in dissipation,
so we can neglect the second term on the RHS of the second
equation to ﬁnd:

˙X = ∆2 sin(φA − φB) + J.
(23)
This set of equations has the simple solutions ˙φA − ˙φB = 0

and ˙X = V given by

There is a critical current Jc = α∆2
|α−β| up to which this solu-
tion exists. This current is generally large, since ∆2 is of the
order of the exchange constant. Physically this critical current
corresponds to the situation when the magnetizations on the
two sublattices rotate with respect to each other and eventu-
ally point in the same direction. For small currents J (cid:28) Jc
this solution shows that a moving AFM DW is not rotating and

has a magnetic moment of the order of ∆X

Magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the nanowire.- Next, we con-
sider the AFM DW dynamics under the action of the mag-
netic ﬁeld along the wire in the absence of current. In this
situation we ﬁnd from Eqs. (18) – (19) that in the steady state
˙φA = ˙φB = 0, and φB = π + φA (a small deviation from this
decays exponentially with time), while ˙XA = ˙XB = 0, and
XA − XB = h/∆1, which show that the induced magnetic
moment is ∼ h∆X /∆1. Also, notice that unlike in a FM DW,
there is no motion induced by an external magnetic ﬁeld in
this conﬁguration.

Magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the nanowire with current.-
Let us consider the AFM DW dynamics under the magnetic
ﬁeld perpendicular to the current, i.e. the nanowire axis. This
magnetic ﬁeld couples to the angles φA and φB, the corre-
sponding term in the Hamiltonian is −h(sin φA + sin φB),
where h is the magnetic ﬁeld multiplied by the perpendicular
magnetization of a single DW. Such term in the Hamiltonian
does not change the equations for ˙φA and ˙φB, see Eqs. (18)
– (19), but adds a term h cos φA to the RHS of equation for
˙XB. Then, it
˙XA and −h cos φB to the RHS of equation for

A simple solution for the steady state at small J and h is given
by XA = XB and ˙XA = β

this is the same result as for the current driven AFM DW mo-
tion. For the angles, we obtain φA = π + φB and

(26)

We notice from Eqs. (24) – (25) that as we switch the cur-
rent with constant magnetic ﬁeld, the angles could also be
switched.

AFM DW orientation switching mechanism.- Given a static
AFM DW without current or magnetic ﬁelds applied to it,
from Eqs. (18) – (19) the conﬁguration is given by XA = XB
and φA = φB or φA = φB + π. The ﬁrst corresponds to a
ferromagnetic state. The second conﬁguration, as we apply a
magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the nanowire, may represent
two different drift velocities, see Eqs. (18) – (19). These dif-
ferent behaviors suggest that it would be interesting to study a
reorientation mechanism for an AFM DW.

First, we notice that a weak magnetic ﬁeld applied parallel
to the nanowire would induce a precession of the AFM DW.
This precession, however, would be extremely slow. As we

5

are interested in practical use for the reorientation, we need to
consider faster processes. This may be obtained by consider-
ing a time dependent current and a magnetic ﬁeld perpendic-
ular to the nanowire.

To illustrate the reorientation mechanism, we consider that
initially XA = XB = X and φA = π − φB = φ. From
Eqs. (24) – (25), we note that these relations are valid for the
entire switching process as long as we apply a time-dependent
current of the form

J(t) =

(cid:104)

1
α − β

∆X

˙φ + α cos φ (2∆2 sin φ − h)

(cid:105)
, (27)

where we neglected the terms proportional to α2. Other types
of currents may be considered for the reorientation. However,
the dynamics involved will be a lot more complex and may not
be possible to obtain the exact time dependence analytically.
For initial angle φ0 we consider that we have a static AFM
DW proﬁle with no current. This implies

sin φ0 =

h
2∆2

.

(28)

In order to obtain the minimum Ohmic losses for the switch-
ing process with ﬁnite time of switching T , we ﬁnd that the
time dependence of φ is given by

t =

γ

(cid:90) φ(t)

(cid:113) ET

(29)

where γ = 2∆2α and ET = ∆2

the time of switching T by

T =

∆X
γ

(cid:90) π−φ0

(cid:113) ET

dφ
γ2 + cos2 φ (sin φ − sin φ0)2

(30)

Therefore, with the current given by Eq. (27) and Eq. (29) sat-
isfying Eq. (28), we are able to efﬁciently switch the orienta-
tion of the AFM DW within a ﬁnite time T given by Eq. (30).
It is important to notice, however, that with the time dependent
current, Eq. (27), it is also possible to obtain other φ(t) evolu-
tions that also corresponds to the switching process, but with
higher energy losses. The integral can be solved in terms of el-
liptic functions, see Fig. 3(a). Once we are able to switch the
orientation in a controllable fashion, one must then measure
the switching of this 180 AFM DW. Whereas most measure-
ments cannot directly observe such DW, a system that contains
the newly discovered Neel spin-orbit torque, [17, 28], can in
principle be sensitive to the orientation of a 180 DW as shown
in Ref. [17]. The measurement of the DW orientation was also
considered in Refs. [45, 48]. One must also notice that dur-
ing the switching process a ﬁnite magnetic moment arises, see

indirect measure of the process.

In the present formulation the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld in the plane perpendicular to the nanowire is arbitrary.
However, in the presence of the transverse anisotropy this ef-
fect will be the largest if the ﬁeld direction is perpendicular

to the transverse anisotropy axis. The current required for the
switching in this case will be determined by both the magni-
tude of the magnetic ﬁeld and by the anisotropy.

CONCLUSION

We have developed a Hamiltonian approach to the current
and magnetic ﬁeld driven dynamics of both ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic DWs, which describes the domain walls as
rigid topological objects. We have shown how dissipation is
included in this description by means of LLG equation for-
malism. The dynamics can be described by a set of univer-
sal equations which depend only on a few parameters. These
parameters can be measured in real nanowires either through
magnetoresistance or through electrical means as shown in
Ref. [45].

We have shown that the developed formalism allows to
solve various problems of both FM and AFM DW dynamics
on the same footing and extend it to different geometries. As
the Hamiltonian formalism does not depend on microscopic
aspects, it allows to easily introduce new interactions. In par-
ticular, it can be used to describe both FM and AFM DW dy-
namics induced by parallel magnetic ﬁeld and current. As a
consequence of this analysis, we were able to obtain a novel
orientation switch mechanism for AFM DWs. With the devel-
opments of measuring techniques, the mechanism described
here may be useful for memory devices.
