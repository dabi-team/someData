The kaon to pion ratio K +/π+ and the scaled variance ω− for ﬂuctuations of negatively charged

particles are studied within the statistical hadron resonance gas (HRG) model and the Ultra rel-

ativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport model. The calculations are done for

p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, and Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron energy range

to reveal the system size dependence of hadron production. For the HRG calculations the canonical

ensemble is imposed for all conserved charges. In the UrQMD simulations the centrality selection in

nucleus-nucleus collisions is done by calculating the forward energy EF deposited in the Projectile

Spectator Detector, and the acceptance maps of the NA61/SHINE detectors are used. A compar-

ison of the HRG and UrQMD results with the data of the NA61/SHINE Collaboration is done.

To understand a diﬀerence of the event-by-event ﬂuctuations in p+p and heavy ion collisions the

centrality selection procedure in the sample of all inelastic p+p events is proposed and analyzed

within the UrQMD simulations.

A main goal of the experimental programs in high energy nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions is to form and

study a new state of matter – the quark gluon plasma (QGP). Proton-proton (p+p) reactions at the same energy

per nucleon serve then as the ‘reference point’, e.g., the strangeness enhancement [1] and J/ψ suppression [2]

observed in central heavy ion collisions have been often referred as the QGP signatures.

An ambitious experimental program for a search of the critical point related to the deconﬁnement transition

is carried out by the NA61/SHINE Collaboration at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) of the European

Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) [3–5]. The program includes a variation in the atomic mass number

A of the colliding nuclei as well as an energy scan. Using these data one hopes to scan the phase diagram in

the plane of temperature T and baryon chemical potential µB and locate a position of the critical point by

studying its event-by-event (e-by-e) ﬂuctuation signals. The results on p+p, Be+Be, and Ar+Sc collisions have

been presented by the NA61/SHINE Collaboration [3, 4, 6], while the Pb+Pb data were presented earlier by

the NA49 Collaboration [7–12]. The studied collisions and the projectile momenta are the following:

Centrality selection of collision events is important for a proper physical interpretation of the measured

ﬂuctuations. In peripheral collisions of heavy ions one can not avoid strong ﬂuctuations of the number of nucleon

participants. These participant number ﬂuctuations become the dominant ones in all e-by-e ﬂuctuations of ﬁnal

hadrons (see a discussion of this point in Refs. [13–19]). The preliminary data on Be+Be collisions from the

NA61/SHINE Collaboration provoked speculations on ‘the onset of ﬁreball’ – rather speciﬁc change of hadron

production properties when moving from small systems, like those created in p+p and light nuclei (Be+Be)

to central collisions of heavy nuclei like Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb in the SPS energy region [6, 20, 21]. The two

observables were presented: a ratio of the mean hadron multiplicities (cid:104)K +(cid:105)/(cid:104)π+(cid:105) and the scaled variance for

negatively charged particles

ω[N−] ≡

3

where (cid:104). . .(cid:105) denotes the e-by-e averaging1.

At the top SPS energy 150 A (158 A) GeV/c the experimental value of the scaled variance ω− in p+p collisions

appears to be larger than in central Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb collisions. On the other hand, the preliminary data in

the central Be+Be collisions correspond to the value of ω− even larger than that in the p+p reactions. The

K +/π+ ratio at the SPS energies remain approximately the same for p+p and Be+Be collisions, but this ratio

becomes (much) larger for heavy ions like Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb. The above results admit a possibility of the

step-like behavior of K +/π+ and ω− as functions of the system size with almost no changes between p+p and

Be+Be, and a signiﬁcant change between Be+Be and Ar+Sc. Thus, the collisions of light nuclei seem to look

as the samples of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions, while the central collisions of heavy ions lead to the

ﬁreball formation. A similar physical picture was suggested in terms of the parton percolation model [22]. What

is an exact value of the atomic number A of colliding nuclei where the ‘onset of ﬁreball’ takes place? How rapid

is the transition from independent nucleon-nucleon collisions observed in reactions with the light nuclei to a

ﬁreball-like behavior seen in the central A+A collisions of heavy nuclei? The answers to these questions are

still unclear.

A goal of this paper is to probe the eﬀects observed by the NA61/SHINE Collaboration by the statistical

hadron resonance gas (HRG) and the transport Ultra relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD)

[23, 24] models. These two approaches are both popular and successful phenomenological models to describe

the hadron production in A+A collisions. We use both models to calculate K +/π+ and ω− in p+p, Be+Be,

Ar+Sc, and Pb+Pb collisions at the SPS energy region.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the canonical ensemble (CE) HRG model calculations.

The results of the UrQMD simulations are presented in Sec. III. Sections II and III include also a comparison

of both models with the available data. Section IV summarizes the paper.

II. K +/π+ RATIO AND ω− IN THE CE HRG

4

In the central collisions of heavy nuclei a formation of the statistical system (ﬁreball) is expected. The HRG

model is used for a description of the latest stage of the ﬁreball evolution, the chemical freeze-out. There are

also numerous successful attempts to use the HRG model for a description of the hadron yields produced in p+p

reactions, see, e.g., [25–28], and references therein. In this case, due to a small size of the system an exact charge

conservation for each microstate of the statistical system becomes important. Thus, the CE should be used. In

the present paper we use the CE HRG calculations for all systems in order to make a systematic comparison

of the hadron production for both small and large systems within the HRG model. For the hadron yields in

Pb+Pb collisions at the SPS energies most of the CE results for hadron yields converge to the grand canonical

ensemble (GCE) results. This is known as the thermodynamic equivalence of the statistical ensembles. In the

GCE, only the average values of the conserved charges are ﬁxed, but their changes from one microstate to

another are allowed. Therefore, the e-by-e hadron number ﬂuctuations are essentially diﬀerent in the CE and

GCE even in the thermodynamic limit [29].

A. Canonical ensemble results

We use the CE HRG for non-interacting hadrons and resonances, presented in details in the recent papers

[26, 28]. The calculations were done using Thermal-FIST package [30], which is publicly available. In the CE

the following parameters are introduced

T, V, γS ,

(2)

where T and V are, respectively, the system temperature and volume at the chemical freeze-out, and γS [31–33]

is the strangeness suppression parameter, which takes into account incomplete chemical equilibration of strange

hadrons. In what follows we use the system radius R ≡ [3V /(4π)]1/3 instead of volume V for convenience. The

baryon number B, electric charge Q and net strangeness S = 0 of the considered system are strictly ﬁxed by

the corresponding values of colliding nuclei.

To clarify the system size dependence in most simple and transparent way, we assume ﬁrst a complete

strangeness equilibrium, γS = 1, and the same value of temperature T for all colliding systems. The values of

5

T at diﬀerent collision energies are taken in the following form [34]:

sN N

(3)

where the parameters a, b, c, d, and e are ﬁxed from the ﬁt to the central Pb+Pb data at the SPS energies in

Ref. [26]. The

√

sN N is the center of mass energy of the nucleon pair in the colliding systems. Therefore, only

the size R of the considered system at the chemical freeze-out remains diﬀerent for diﬀerent colliding nuclei.

To ﬁnd the system size at the freeze-out for diﬀerent colliding nuclei we use an approximation of equal baryon

densities ρB in all considered A+A systems, and assume that this value of ρB is equal to the values found in the

GCE HRG with Eq. (3). The function ρB(

√

sN N ) calculated in this way is shown in Fig. 1 (a). The obtained

radius R = [3B/(4πρB)]1/3, where total baryonic number B equals to the number of nucleon participants, is

shown in Fig. 1 (b) for the systems studied by the NA61/SHINE Collaboration. Note that the numerical values

of ρ and R should be interpreted with care because of the excluded volume corrections eﬀects neglected in the

present paper. A presence of nonzero baryon proper volumes would lead to smaller ρB and larger R values [35].

The corresponding values of K +/π+ and ω− calculated in the CE HRG for non-interacting hadron species

are shown in Figs. 2 (a) and (b), respectively, as functions of the collision energy.

6

Figure 2: The results of the CE HRG calculations for the K +/π+ ratio (a) and the scaled variance ω− of negatively

charged particles (b) as functions of the collision energy.

Within HRG the intensive quantities, particularly K +/π+ and ω−, are the functions of T and µB, and they

are not sensitive to the system volume V in the GCE. This is not the case for the CE considered in our studies.

The global charge conservation suppresses the mean multiplicities of hadrons in small systems. Signiﬁcant

CE suppression eﬀects happen for hadron yields when the total number of particles and antiparticles of that

corresponding conserved charge is of an order of unity or smaller. This leads, e.g., to (cid:104)K +(cid:105)CE < (cid:104)K +(cid:105)GCE at

ﬁnite values of V because of the exact strangeness conservation. This diﬀerence of the hadron yields in the CE

and GCE becomes negligible in the thermodynamic limit V → ∞. On the other hand, the smaller CE values of

the particle number ﬂuctuations, e.g. ω−

CE < ω−

GCE

∼= 1, are just most pronounced in the thermodynamic limit.

From Fig. 2 one can see the CE eﬀects due to the charge conservation, i.e., (K +/π+)A+A > (K +/π+)p+p

and (ω−)A+A < (ω−)p+p. Even more, the K +/π+ ratio increases and ω− decreases monotonously with the

size of colliding systems. Therefore, the CE suppression is stronger for the particle yields in small systems like

p+p, and for particle number ﬂuctuations in large systems like Pb+Pb, Figs. 2 (a) and (b), respectively (see

also Ref. [29]). Note that the diﬀerences between p+p and A+A collisions are stronger at the smallest collision

energies. These features of the CE HRG are similar to those observed in the data. However, contrary to the

data, practically the whole system size dependence in the CE HRG model occurs in between p+p and Be+Be,

and a little change is seen in between Be+Be and Pb+Pb.

B.

Incomplete strangeness equilibration and acceptance corrections in HRG

A quantitative comparison of the CE HRG model results with the data requires several further steps. An

incomplete equilibration of the strange hadrons and a ﬁnite detector acceptance should be taken into account.

Many previous ﬁts of the hadron multiplicity data within the HRG model, both in the GCE and CE, demon-

strated an incomplete chemical equilibration of the strange hadrons. This is usually compensated by the

strangeness suppression parameter γS [31–33, 36] with numerical values in the range of 0.5 < γS < 1 for the

SPS energies. The number of strange and antistrange particles becomes then smaller than that expected in

the equilibrium HRG. The suppression factor γn

S for each hadron depends on the number n of strange quarks

and/or antiquarks in a given hadron. The small values of γS ∼ 0.5 correspond to p+p and small SPS energies,

larger γS ∼ 1 to central collisions of heavy nuclei and large SPS energies [37]. A comparison of the CE HRG

results with the available data are presented in Fig. 3. Dashed and dotted lines in Figs. 3 (a) and (b) present

the CE HRG results with, γS = 1 and γS = 0.5, respectively.

The HRG model calculates the hadron multiplicities in the whole phase-space, the so-called full 4π acceptance.

However, e-by-e hadron yield measurements are done within the ﬁnite acceptance of the detectors. In order to

correct the HRG scaled variance with respect to the experimental acceptance the following simple formula is

often used (see, e.g., [29])

ω− = 1 − q + q ω−

4π .

(4)

In Eq. (4), q = (cid:104)N−(cid:105)/(cid:104)N−(cid:105)4π, where (cid:104)N−(cid:105) and (cid:104)N−(cid:105)4π are the average N− values in the accepted region and

in the full phase space, respectively, and ω− and (ω−)4π denote the scaled variances of the accepted hadrons

and all ﬁnal hadrons, respectively. Equation (4) assumes the binomial acceptance probability which, however,

can be violated (see, e.g., Ref. [19]). The CE HRG results presented in Figs. 3 (c) and (d) are calculated for

γS = 1. The value of ω− is almost independent of γS, as the majority of negatively charged particles are π−

mesons. The CE HRG predicts a monotonous decrease of the 4π values of ω− with atomic number of colliding

8

nuclei. This is seen in Fig. 2 (b). The results presented in Figs. 3 (c) and (d) are based on Eq. (4) with the

acceptance parameter q estimated by the Monte-Carlo simulations of the detector acceptance. The eﬀects of

a non-monotonous behavior of ω− with A seen in Figs. 3 (c) and (d) for the accepted particles appear only

because of the smaller values of the acceptance parameter q in Eq. (4) for Pb+Pb collisions (q ∼= 0.06 and

q ∼= 0.16 for 30 and 158 A GeV/c, respectively) in comparison to other A+A and p+p reactions (q ∼= 0.3 and

q ∼= 0.4 for 30/31 and 150/158 A GeV/c, respectively).

The value of ω− < 1 are observed for all colliding systems at 30/31 A GeV/c and for large systems, namely

Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb, at the highest available SPS energy, 150/158 A GeV/c. All these data can be qualitatively

described by the CE HRG. However, for the two smallest systems, p+p and Be+Be, at 150/158 A GeV/c the

data correspond to the large values, ω− > 1. In these two cases the CE HRG results are in contradiction with

the data.

III. K +/π+ RATIO AND ω− IN THE URQMD MODEL

A. Centrality Selection in A+A collisions

The NA61/SHINE Collaboration uses the Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD) to measure the forward energy

EF. This is the energy deposited in a small angle of the forward hemisphere. The calorimeter is not able to

identify particles, thus, not only the projectile spectators contribute to EF. To make a proper comparison with

the data the experimental centrality selection and acceptance are imposed in our UrQMD simulations. This is

done in Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions with the maps of the PSD and NA61/SHINE detectors [41]. In Pb+Pb

collisions the zero value of the impact parameter b is used in the UrQMD simulations, and only the acceptance

maps of the NA61/SHINE detectors are imposed. Pb+Pb collisions with b = 0 correspond approximately to

the 1% most central events (see, e.g., Refs. [14, 40]).

A selection of an appropriate centrality class is a special task. One needs a sample with the suﬃcient number

of events. On the other hand, this sample can not be too wide to minimize the ‘background ﬂuctuations‘, e.g.,

geometrical ﬂuctuations of the impact parameter b. The centrality classes obtained in the UrQMD simulations

are presented in Fig. 4. The event distributions by the EF look rather monotonous where contributions from

number of nucleons in the colliding nuclei. See text for details. The data are shown by red squares for K +/π+ [7, 38, 39]

and for ω− [20, 40].

every single participant are smeared out by secondary particles that ﬂy into forward calorimeter. However,

for small systems and energies one is still able to observe peaks in the distributions that allow to identify

contribution from a single participant. For example, in Be+Be at 30A GeV one can observe 7 peaks that are

produced by 1-7 spectator nucleons in the Be+Be collision, see Fig. 4(a).

A behavior of the scaled variance ω− as a function of centrality is shown in Fig. 5. For 1% of most central

collision events the values of ω− are saturated. An increase of the scaled variance ω− in the wider samples of

collision events is seen. It happens because of large ﬂuctuations of the number of nucleon participants. This

eﬀect has mostly a simple geometrical origin.

The colored regions correspond to diﬀerent centrality classes that are indicated with respective numbers.

EP = Ebeam − EF .

(5)

Figure 5 shows that the value of Ω[N−, EP] is not much sensitive to the centrality class. One also observes that

the saturation of ω− does occur in the region of centralities where ω− ∼= Ω[N−, EP].

Centrality selection in inelastic p+p reactions

12

A model of the independent sources, particularly the wounded nucleon model [43], considers A+A collisions

as independent nucleon-nucleon collisions. Under these assumptions the scaled variance ω− can be presented

as [43]

A+A = ω−

where ω−

N+N and (cid:104)n−(cid:105)N+N are, respectively, the scaled variance and mean multiplicities of negatively charged

hadrons in nucleon-nucleon collisions, and ωpart is the scaled variance for the e-by-e ﬂuctuations of the nucleon

participants. At plab = 150 GeV/c the approximate relations (cid:104)n−(cid:105)N+N

to be valid [13, 14]. Equation (6) gives then a larger value of ω− in any A+A collisions than that in p+p

rigid centrality selection in A+A collisions. However, Eq. (6) is evidently in contradiction with ω−

seen in the data. At the largest SPS collision energies the experimental data suggests ω−

p+p > 1, and ω−

A+A < 1

for most central heavy ion collisions.

What is the origin of ω−

p+p > 1 at large collision energies? We argue that the main reason of the large e-by-e

ﬂuctuations of hadron multiplicities is an absence of the ‘centrality selection’ in p+p inelastic reactions. For

p+p reactions one considers a sample of all inelastic p+p events. A comparison of the hadron production in

most central A+A events and all inelastic p+p reactions is not however conclusive. In fact, one expects the

strong non-statistical ﬂuctuations in p+p reactions. A presence of these non-statistical ﬂuctuations in p+p

reactions is clearly seen at very high collision energies where ω− (cid:29) 1.

To study this problem we introduce the ‘centrality selection’ for p+p inelastic reactions within the UrQMD

simulations. The centrality samples in p+p inelastic reactions will be deﬁned by measuring EF in the same way

as in the A+A collisions. We do not discuss here a physical interpretation of these diﬀerent centralities in p+p

reactions. Because of a lack of the PSD acceptance maps for p+p collisions, we use the Be+Be experimental

maps to calculate the energy deposited in the PSD. The UrQMD results for the ‘centrality samples’ in p+p

inelastic reactions are shown in Figs. 6 (a) and (b). In p+p inelastic reactions there is a non-vanishing probability

that no particle is emitted to the forward energy calorimeter. Among inelastic p+p collisions at plab = 31 GeV/c

and 158 GeV/c there are, respectively, about 48% and 13% of inelastic collision events with EF = 0. These

samples with EF = 0 will be deﬁned as most central p+p inelastic reactions. Future experimental improvements

would make possible a more precise centrality triggering.

C. Comparison with the data

14

We present now a comparison of the UrQMD results with the new experimental data of NA61/SHINE

Collaboration and older Pb+Pb data of the NA49 Collaboration. The K +/π+ and ω− as functions of the

system size are presented in Fig. 7.

As seen from Figs. 7 (a) and (b) the UrQMD values of the K +/π+ ratio are systematically smaller than

the experimental ones. A main reason of an underestimation of strange hadron production in the UrQMD

model is a restriction to the two-body hadron collisions only [44]. In the transport approach which includes the

parton degrees of freedom the strange hadron production seems to be in agreement with the data [45]. On the

other hand, a monotonic increase of the K +/π+ ratio with the size of colliding nuclei observed in the data is

reproduced by the UrQMD simulations.

As already pointed out, the scaled variance ω− is very sensitive to the centrality selection. Figures 7 (c) and

(d) present a comparison of the UrQMD results with the available data for ω−. The UrQMD demonstrates a

good agreement with the ω− data for Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb central collisions, and for all inelastic p+p collisions.

There is only one reaction which is out of the description – Be+Be at 150A GeV/c. Note that this data point

has still a preliminary status, and additional experimental checks are in progress [46].

For the UrQMD simulations of p+p reactions we also present the results for ‘most central’ p+p events

calculated in the samples with EF = 0. These results are presented by crosses. The centrality selection

performed for p+p reactions within the UrQMD simulations leads to essentially smaller values of ω−

p+p.

IV. SUMMARY

The K +/π+ ratio and the scaled variance for negatively charged particles ω− are calculated within the

HRG and UrQMD models in p+p and A+A collisions at the SPS energy range. The HRG calculations are

done within the CE with the three conserved charges – baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness. A

qualitative agreement with the new data of the NA61/SHINE Collaboration – a monotonous increase of the

K +/π+ ratio with a size of colliding nuclei – is observed. The strangeness suppression factor γS < 1 reﬂecting

an incomplete strangeness equilibration leads to improvement of the quantitative agreement of the CE HRG

results with the K +/π+ data.

The data on ω− < 1 in Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb most central collisions can be described by the CE HRG.

However, for the two smallest systems, p+p and Be+Be, at the highest SPS energy, the CE HRG results are in

contradiction with the large experimental values of ω− > 1.

The UrQMD calculations are done by applying the acceptance cuts and event selection procedure used by

the NA61/SHINE Collaboration. Particularly, the centrality selection is done using the forward energy EF

deposited in the PSD. The UrQMD explains the qualitative trends of the K +/π+ ratio. A comparison of the

UrQMD results with the data on ω− looks well except for only one point – Be+Be at 150A GeV/c.

Two eﬀects – statistical and dynamical – are identiﬁed in the e-by-e ﬂuctuations of hadron production at the

SPS energies. Statistical eﬀects are clearly seen in the both CE HRG and UrQMD calculations. This is ﬁrst

of all a suppression of the particle number ﬂuctuations because of the global charge conservation. Contrary

to naive expectations these suppression eﬀects are stronger for large collective systems. On the other hand,

one also sees a presence of the dynamical ﬂuctuations. They are most clearly pronounced in the sample of all

inelastic p+p reactions at high collision energy. The experimental value of the scaled variance ω− becomes

larger than unity. This can not be explained within the CE HRG model. The UrQMD model takes the p+p

data, both hadron yields and their e-by-e ﬂuctuations, as the input to describe A+A collisions. Thus, the model

takes into account these dynamical eﬀects in p+p reactions. The only reaction for which the value of ω− is not

described by the UrQMD simulation is Be+Be at 150 A GeV/c. Note that the UrQMD results for ω− in this

reaction appear to be extremely sensitive to the exact centrality selection procedure.

To clarify the dynamical features of the e-by-e ﬂuctuations we propose to implement the centrality selection

procedure in p+p reactions. A comparison of p+p and A+A collisions should be done with the appropriate

centrality selection procedures in both reactions.
