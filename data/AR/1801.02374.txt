Introduction

The group III-nitrides are excellent materials for fabrication of diﬀerent types of
electronic and optoelectronic devices [1] owing to their superior electronic and
structural properties such as wide, direct and tunable bandgap, high electron
mobility, high electron peak velocity, stability in harsh chemical environments,
high thermal conductivity, etc. Examples of applications of III-nitrides include
LEDs, lasers, high power and high frequency electronics, sensors, photovoltaics,
etc. However, to attain optimal performance of these devices several issues need
to be resolved. Among the various limitations, forming dislocation and defect
free III-nitride thin ﬁlms, p-doping the material and making ohmic contacts
to the device structures remain predominant, and are constantly addressed by
researchers. Though several approaches have been adopted, of late, there is great
interest in nanostructuring the material to exploit their novel properties in low
dimensions, due to electron and photon conﬁnement, strain relaxed growth and
large surface to volume ratio.[2]

In the recent past, we have reported several interesting results on the for-
mation and properties of the self-assembled GaN nanowall network.[3],[4] This
conﬁguration displays unprecedented properties such as low defect, high conduc-
tivity, high mobility, etc. Fabrication of devices exploiting these nanostructures
necessitates a thorough understanding of the surface and interface properties
of diﬀerent morphological manifestations of materials which display diﬀerent
surface chemistry and electronic states. This diﬀerence, in turn, aﬀects forma-
tion of metal contacts, [5] Fermi level pinning, [6] band bending [7] etc, all of
which are crucial in device fabrication. By kinetically varying growth condi-
tions, nanostructured ﬁlms of various morphologies can be deposited. Density

and type of point defects and dislocations, strain, etc, all depend on the struc-
ture and morphology of the material and therefore electrical and luminescence
properties can be tuned by changing the kinetics of growth. In this work we have
grown GaN samples of diﬀerent morphologies using PAMBE by controlling the
growth parameters and probed their surface chemistry and electronic structure,
and related them to the corresponding electrical and luminescence properties.

2 Experimental

The GaN thin ﬁlms S1 to S3 were grown using a radio frequency plasma assisted
molecular beam epitaxy system (SVTA). High purity Ga metal (99.99999 %)
and nitrogen gas (99.9995%) were used as sources. C-plane sapphire (α-Al2O3)
was used as the substrate, which was degreased by ultrasonicating in organic
solvents and rinsed in deionized water, before being inserted in the preparation
chamber of MBE. Here, it was subjected to thermal cleaning by degassing it
at 600 ◦C for 1 hour. The substrate is then transferred to the main growth
chamber where it is again degassed at 850 ◦C for 30 minutes. The samples
S1 to S3 were grown in nitrogen rich conditions, while the substrate was held
at 630 ◦C. Ga K cell temperatures of 1050 ◦C, 1020 ◦C, 1100 ◦C and nitro-
gen ﬂow rates of 4.5 sccm, 6 sccm and 4.5 sccm were used for forming samples
S1, S2 and S3, respectively. All samples were grown for a duration of 4 hours
with the RF plasma forward power of 375 W. The sample S4 is a commercially
obtained 2 µm thick MOCVD grown GaN ﬂat epilayer which is used for com-
parative studies of morphology dependence of properties. The morphology of
the samples were observed by a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
(FESEM, FEI Qunata 3D), which is also equipped to provide the cathodolumi-
nescence (CL) spectra of the samples. Electrical properties were determined by
Hall measurements at room temperature using Ecopia Hall measurement sys-
tem (HMS 3000) and the surface chemistry was studied by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, Omicron). The as-deposited samples were directly inserted
in the XPS chamber, without any surface treatment, to determine their native
properties. Both non-monochromated Al K-α (1486.7) and Mg K-α (1253.6)
were used as X-ray sources. After the initial studies, 0.8 KeV energy Ar+ ion
sputtering was employed for various times to remove the surface contaminants,
followed by XPS core level and valence band analysis.

3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the plan view FESEM images of samples S1 to S4, which display the
reducing surface roughness and porosity. S1 is a highly porous random network
of nanowalls, which will henceforth be referred to as nanowall network (NWN).
The width of the base of the tapered walls are a few hundred nanometres whereas
the tips (apex) are less than 10 nm. S2 is a relatively ﬂat ﬁlm with high density
of small pores, while sample S3 consists of large coalesced ﬂat topped islands.

S4 is the highly ﬂat GaN epilayer. The surface roughness of the samples was
quantiﬁed by atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Figure 1: The FESEM plan view images of S1-S4. The samples are progressively
ﬂatter. The scale bar is 1 µm.

From the SEM image it is clear that since the pores of S1 are deep, the
tapping mode AFM study may not provide an accurate value of roughness, but
it is suﬃcient for comparison purposes. The RMS roughness of the samples from
S1 to S4 were found to be 57.4, 19.9, 7.8 and 0.4 nm, respectively. The samples
were cut into smaller pieces (≈ 1cm x 1cm), and indium metal contacts were
made on one set of samples to study the electrical properties. Four probe Hall
measurement, in van der Pauw geometry was carried out. The bulk electron
concentration and resistivity of the samples are given in Table 1. All samples
are unintentionally n-doped,with S1 and S2 having bulk electron concentration
of (cid:118) 1020cm−3 , while S3 has (cid:118) 1019cm−3 and S4 has (cid:118) 1017cm−3 . Also it is
seen that resistivities of S1 and S2 are about 10−3 Ω-cm whereas S3 and S4 are
about 10−1 Ω-cm.

A number of factors can be responsible for this unintentional doping, such
as nitrogen vacancy (VN ), oxygen impurity (ON ) [8] etc. A tiny amount of oxy-
gen is observed, which may come from impurities in the source or by diﬀusion
from the Al2O3 substrate.The natural propensity of GaN to be unintention-
ally n-doped has often been attributed to the formation of VN [9]. The XPS
studies of the samples, were done by acquiring survey and core level spectra,
without any surface treatment, to study the native surface. It was found that
the GaN samples have oxygen and carbon contaminants on the surface due to
handling, storage, and atmospheric exposure. The adventitious carbon is usu-
ally unreactive and does not react with gallium. The oxygen species can form

3

stoichiometric (Ga2O3) or non-stoichiometric (GaOx) gallium oxides or even
gallium oxynitrides. For the analysis of XPS data, the adventitious carbon was
assumed to be of hydrocarbon nature [10] and its binding energy (B.E.) was
taken as 284.8 eV . For the analysis of core level spectra a Shirley background
correction was employed and then deconvolution was performed using ﬁtting
parameters from the literature. The peak shape was taken to be Voigt, with
Gaussian function of 80% and Lorentzian of 20%. Fig. 2. shows the deconvo-
luted Ga 3d spectra of samples S1-S4. The peak at 18.1 is due to the Ga-Ga
metallic bond [11]. While the peak at (19.3 ± 0.2) eV and the one at (20.4 ± 0.1)
eV have been assigned to Ga-N bond and Ga-O bond, respectively.
[12][13]
Prabhakaran et. al.
[14] found the native oxide on GaN to be predominantly
monoclinic β −Ga2O3 although they could not rule out formation of oxynitrides.

Figure 2: The deconvoluted Ga 3d core level spectra of samples S1 - S4

The spectra in all cases predominantly show the Ga-N component, with
Ga-O component occurring at higher B.E. value and the Ga-Ga component oc-
curring at low B.E. value. It can be observed in Fig. 2 that samples S1 and S2
contain Ga-Ga metallic bond which is absent in samples S3 and S4.To get the
absolute surface composition of a sample from XPS, a completely clean surface
is required. Various methods are employed to achieve completely clean surfaces,
such as, ion sputtering [15], HCl cleaning [16], atomic hydrogen cleaning [17], in
situ annealing, [18] etc. Each of these methods have their own peculiar eﬀects
on the surface.The surface chemistry changes signiﬁcantly after prolonged Ar+
sputtering, whereas without sputtering, the adsorbates mask the true composi-
tion. The thick GaN epilayer (S4) has been assumed to be stoichiometric GaN
and relative compositions for sample S1-S3 have been estimated. A light 5 min-

4

utes sputtering (0.8 KeV, 50 µA) was employed on all the samples to remove
some of the adsorbed contaminants. After that the peak intensities (area under
peak after background subtraction) were measured and the elemental concen-
trations for Ga, N, O and C were estimated with appropriate atomic sensitivity
factors (ASF), using the following relation:

Concentration of X =

IX /SX
(cid:80) Ii/Si

(1)

where, Ii and Si are intensity and ASF of i-th element. In Fig. 3 the nitrogen
to gallium concentration ratio has been plotted along with the bulk electron
concentrations obtained from Hall measurements.
It can be seen from this
ﬁgure that porous samples S1 and S2, have a Ga rich surface, with higher
electron concentrations and lower resistivities (see Table 1). Sample S3 has
the most Ga deﬁcient surface and least electron concentration among the MBE
grown samples studied.

Figure 3: Graph showing surface stoichiometry of 5 minute sputtered samples
and their respective bulk electron concentration measured from Hall experiment.

A surface rich in gallium might mean either the surface is Ga terminated (N
polar material), or that the N vacancies on a nonpolar/semipolar surface yield
a termination consisting mostly of Ga atoms, whose dangling bonds reconstruct
to minimize the high surface energy. Similar to that reported for InN, the
thermodynamically stable GaN surface conﬁguration is cation terminated with
another cation adlayer on top of it, which can yield the Ga rich surface, [19]
forming an electron accumulation layer. Considering S3, a Ga deﬁcient surface
can indicate the presence of Ga vacancies, yielding the well known GaN yellow
luminescence (YL) at around 2.2 eV ((cid:118)560 nm). [20],[21]

To see the presence of such features, cathodoluminescence (CL) of samples
S1-S4 was carried out at room temperature,with diﬀerent acceleration voltages
and electron beam currents. Fig. 4 shows the CL spectra of the samples with
an acceleration voltage of 20 KV and a beam current of 4nA. All the samples
yield a peak at (3.40 ± 0.03) eV, which is related to the band edge emission of
GaN. It is clear that for the NBE emission, GaN epilayer (sample S4) has the

lowest FWHM of 84 meV; followed by GaN NWN (sample S1) 104.4 meV, while
S3 and S2 have higher widths of 111.3 meV and 134.4 meV, respectively. An
important point to observe is hat S1 has no defect related luminescence in the
400-600 nm region. Sample S2 has an unusually broad NBE peak with signiﬁcant
asymmetry. S3 has another peak around 3.2-3.25 eV and a broad peak around
2.2 eV which is the YL peak. Sample S4 has atleast two defect related peaks,
one around 2.8 eV and one around 2.15 eV. The 2.8 eV blue luminescence (BL),
(cid:118) 3.25 eV UV luminescence (UVL) are identiﬁed as defect related emissions in
the literature, but the attribution to speciﬁc defects has been ambiguous. Some
researchers [22],[23] ascribe the 2.8 BL to nitrogen vacancy or its complexes,
eg. (VN -H), while H.C. Yang et. al. [24] relate it to the transition between ON
donor level and (VGa-ON ) complex deep level. Appearance of the 3.25 eV peak
in the nominally undoped GaN sample is somewhat unusual, as it is mostly seen
in Mg:GaN materials, [25]. Nevertheless this emission is sometimes explained
to be due to nitrogen vacancies and incorporated hydrogen. [22]

To understand the variation of band structure due to the morphology of
the ﬁlms, we use XPS to locate the position of Fermi level, band bending and
band ﬁlling. While the conduction band edge and surface Fermi level positions
can be found from absorption (or luminescence) spectra and XPS valence band
measurements, respectively, the position of Fermi level in the bulk of the sample
is not easy to experimentally measure, unless the sample is degenerately doped.
To estimate (EF -EV ) in the bulk, a simple calculation was performed. [26] For
n-doped semiconductors, the electron concentration before doping (ni) and after
doping (n0) are related as:

6

n0 = ni exp(

EF − Ei
KBT

)

which can be rearranged to give

EF − Ei = KBT ln(

n0
ni

)

Now, ni is given as : [27]

ni =

where, NC and NV are the conduction and valence band density of states,
and other symbols have their usual meaning. Further, these two quantities are
given as :

Using standard values and taking T=300 K, we get NC = 2.23x1018 cm−3
and NV = 4.16x1019 cm−3 from which the intrinsic electron concentration is
found to be: ni = 3.87x10−10 cm−3.

NV = 2[

]

Then, by using the n0 values from Table 1, we get the energy diﬀerence
between bulk Fermi level and band midpoint (Ei) for samples S1-S4 as: 1.78
eV, 1.76 eV, 1.70 eV and 1.60 eV, respectively, corresponding to decreasing n-
doping. Thus, we observe that samples S1 and S2 are degenerately doped,which
is also seen in UV-visible spectroscopy studies (not shown here) with absorption
edge at (cid:118) 3.5 eV, for sample S1. To locate the position of Fermi level on the
sample surface, a straight line was ﬁt to the leading edge of the valence band
spectra, whose intersection with the background gives the position of valence
band maximum (EV ), with respect to EF = 0 eV binding energy. (EF -EV )
values so found, are: 2.0 eV, 1.8 eV, 1.6 eV and 1.7 eV, respectively, for samples
S1, S2, S3 and S4. The resulting band diagrams for S1 and S2 are shown in
Fig 5. All the samples show an upward band bending of 1.44 eV, 1.63 eV,
1.8 eV and 1.6 eV, respectively. These values are also conﬁrmed by measuring
the separation between valence band maximum and Ga 3d core level, which is
independent of band bending or any other eﬀect. Using the (EV - EGa3d ) value
of 17.76 eV, given by Waldrop and Grant, [28] and the Ga 3d core level position,
the position of surface Fermi level with respect to VBM, (EF -EV ) are found to
be : 2 eV, 1.7 eV, 1.7 eV and 1.3 eV, for S1, S2, S3 and S4 respectively, which
agree well with the ﬁrst method.

Thus, the results show that the Fermi level gets pinned at (1.8 ± 0.2) eV
above VBM, for samples S1 and S2. Earlier, the experimental work of Koan et.
al. [29] showed that for GaN samples covered with a thin Ga adlayer, the Fermi
level gets pinned 1.65 eV above VBM, and Van de Walle et. al. showed by

7

Figure 5: The calculated band bending for samples S1 and S2. The band gap
was found to be 3.4 eV from CL spectra. The surface Fermi level position was
determined from XPS by linear ﬁt of valence band leading edge. The bulk Fermi
level position was estimated from band theory calculations.

DFT calculations [30] that for a metallic bilayer consisting of the terminating
Ga atom and a Ga adatom, the Fermi level gets pinned at 1.8 eV above VBM for
both polar and non-polar GaN surfaces. Comparison of these literature values
and our data suggests that a Ga adlayer exists at the surface of samples S1 and
S2.

Next, we study the eﬀect of sputtering on the samples surface chemistry.
Ar+ sputtering is a very commonly used method to prepare clean surfaces. [15]
However, an inherent problem in that is the sputter yield, (average number of
target atoms sputtered per incident Ar+ ion) is not the same for all elements.
Since the rate of nitrogen sputtering is more than that of gallium, the surface
chemistry is signiﬁcantly changed. Fig. 6 shows the core level Ga 3d spectra of
S1 deconvoluted into Voigt components, for the unsputtered sample and after
10 and 20 minutes of sputtering. As it can be expected, with sputtering, the
gallium oxide component reduces, while the metallic Ga-Ga bond contribution
increases. The calculated Ga/N absolute concentration ratio for unsputtered S1
sample and after 5, 10 and 20 minutes of sputtering, are: 0.3, 0.9,0.9 and 1.2,
respectively, indicating that the surface becomes more metal rich with increasing
Ar+ sputtering. Such surface metallization with ion sputtering is also reported
in the literature [31],[32].

Fig. 7 shows the normalized VB spectra of sample S1 at diﬀerent sputtering
times. Defects at semiconductor surfaces lead to a change in the DOS. [33] As
VB spetcra reﬂects the total DOS of the semiconductor, the type and abundance
of point defects can be estimated from VB spectra. A few observations can be
made from Fig. 7. The unsputtered VB spectra has two prominent features, one
around 3-4 eV (PA) and another around 8-9 eV (PB). The low binding energy
peak originates from the hybridization of Ga 4p and N 2p orbitals and is p-like.
The higher binding energy peak is s-like and is attributed to hybridization of
Ga 4s and N 2p orbitals. The feature appearing in between these two peaks is
attributed to adsorbates or mixed hybridized orbitals. [34],[35] It has been found
from experimental studies that there is a direct correlation between relative
intensities of PA and PB and the polarity of the sample.

D. Skuridina et. al.

[36] showed that if the intensity of PA is higher than
PB, the material is cation polar, whereas if the reverse occurs, it is N polar. So,
from the Fig. 7, it appears that S1 is N polar. After this initial visual analysis,
the VB spectra was ﬁtted by 4 Voigt peaks each, in the way described earlier.

The peaks at 5.4 eV and 9.1 eV are assigned to Ga 4s N 2p hybridized orbitals.

The peak P3, as mentioned before, is generally attributed to be either adsor-
bate related or due to mixed hybrid orbitals. Since this peak intensity did not
change with sputtering, we discount the role of adsorbates, and attribute it to
mixed hybrid orbitals. A prominent observation that can be made from Fig. 7
is that a signiﬁcant intensity can be seen gradually building up near the Fermi
level position with sputtering, which is a characteristic of surface metallization
as also seen in the Ga 3d core level changes in Fig. 6.

4 Conclusion

In conclusion, MBE grown GaN samples of diﬀerent morphologies were studied.
It was found that GaN nanowall network has high conductivity and no defect
related luminescence. From XPS measurements and theoretical calculations it
was found that the Fermi level gets pinned (1.8±0.2) eV for the nanowall, which
indicates that there is a Ga metallic adlayer present on its surface. The ﬂatter
samples showed lower conductivity and defect related yellow luminescence due
It was found that Ar+ sputtering, leads
to Ga vacancies at their surfaces.
to surface metallization as conﬁrmed from XPS core level and valence band
measurements. This study helps gain an insight into the correlation between
morphology and surface chemistry that is useful in employing such systems to
fabricate devices.
