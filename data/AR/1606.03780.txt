Angular dependence of photoemission time delay for the valence np3/2 and np1/2 subshells of
Ar, Kr and Xe is studied in the dipole relativistic random phase approximation. Strong angular
anisotropy of the time delay is reproduced near respective Cooper minima while the spin-orbit
splitting aﬀects the time delay near threshold.

INTRODUCTION

A measurable time delay in laser driven atomic ion-
ization has been discovered recently [1, 2].
Since
the ﬁrst pioneering experiments, the time-delay spec-
troscopy of
laser-induced atomic ionization (attosec-
ond chronoscopy) has become a rapidly developing ﬁeld
[3]. Among other characteristic features, an angular
anisotropy of attosecond time delay relative to polariza-
tion of laser light has been predicted theoretically [4, 5]
and measured experimentally [6].
In one-photon pho-
toionization of atomic np subshells, the time delay can
show some angular anisotropy due to the interplay of the
ǫs and ǫd photoelectron continua [4, 5]. This anisotropy
becomes particularly strong near a Cooper minimum
ǫd channel, making the nomi-
in the dominant np
nally weak np
In two-color
(two-photon) XUV/IR experiments, the interference of
these photoemission channels can manifest itself even in
a spherically symmetric ns atomic subshell. This leads
to a strong angular anisotropy of the measured time de-
lay when the ǫd continuum has a kinematic node near
the magic angle of 54.7◦. Such a strong anisotropy has
indeed been measured in He in a recent RABBITT (Re-
construction of Attosecond Beating By Interference of
Two-photon Transitions) experiment[6]. Another inter-
esting aspect of photoemission time delay is its sensitivity
to the ﬁne structure of the ionized target. Recent experi-
ments have detected such a sensitivity in the valence shell
photoionization of the Kr and Xe atoms [7].

In this paper, we investigate both the angular and spin
dependence of the time delay using the dipole relativis-
tic random phase approximation (RRPA). We expand
our previous relativistic studies of the time delay [8, 9]

and include the full interference of all the spin-orbit cou-
pled photoionization channels. In the previous studies,
only the time delay in the dominant channel was evalu-
ated. We validate our theoretical model using the angu-
lar dependent time delay near the Cooper minimum of
the 3p subshell of Ar. For the relatively light Ar atom,
our RRPA results agree very well with non-relativistic
random-phase approximation with exchange (RPAE) 1
calculations [4]. For heavier Kr and Xe atoms, we clearly
observe the manifestation of relativistic eﬀects. One such
eﬀect is a spin-orbit splitting of the time delay near
threshold.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II a a brief
theoretical formulation is given. In section III the results
for the angle and energy dependence of Wigner time delay
for photoemission from outer np1/2 and np3/2 subshells
of atomic Ar, Kr and Xe are presented and discussed; Ne
is omitted because there is no Cooper minimum in its
photoionization cross section. Conclusions are drawn in
section IV.

II. THEORETICAL METHOD

A. Photoionization amplitude

We adopt the multichannel RRPA formalism of John-
son and Lin [11].
In this formalism, the amplitude for
a transition from the ground state (ui) to an excited
state (ωi±),
induced by a time varying external ﬁeld
v+e−iωt + v−eiωt is given by

A. Argon

Argon is hardly a relativistic target and only cho-
sen here for validation and calibration of our theoretical
model against the previous calculations [4, 5] and experi-
ment [17]. The time delay of Ar 3p1/2 and 3p3/2 subshells
in the energy range encompassing the Cooper minimum
is shown in Fig. 1 for the ﬁxed emission angles θ = 0◦
(top panel) and θ = 45◦ (middle panel). Comparison is
made with the non-relativistic RPAE calculations [4, 15]
and the exterior complex scaling (ECS) calculation [5].
The bottom panel displays the angular averaged result
where a comparison is also shown with a RABBITT ex-
periment [17] in which no discrimination with the photo-
electron direction was made.

Using Eqs. (5) and (7), we can express the amplitudes
via the corresponding radial integrals modiﬁed by the
phase factors. For a mildly relativistic atom, the radial
integrals with ¯j = ¯l
1/2 orbitals will be very similar.
Hence we can neglect this diﬀerence and reduce the am-
plitudes to the following expressions:

The RRPA calculations have been performed with the
following channels coupled: 14 channels for Ar (all dipole
excitations from the 3p, 3s and 2p subshells), 18 channels
for Kr (excitations from the 4p, 4s, 3d and 3p subshells)
and 18 channels for Xe (the 5p, 5s, 4d and 4p subshells).
In addition, where available, experimental threshold en-
ergies from [16] were used to facilitate better comparison
with experiment. These energies are identical to those
displayed in Table 1 of [8].

FIG. 1: (Color online) The time delay of Ar 3p1/2 (green
dashed line) and 3p3/2 (blue dotted line) is plotted versus
the photon energy. The nonrelativistic RPAE results from
Ref. [15] and RPAE-2 from [4] are shown by the red solid
line and ﬁlled circles, respectively. The top panel: θ = 0◦,
middle panel: θ = 45◦, bottom panel: angular average. The
experimental data from [17] are shown on the bottom panel
with error bars.

In the polarization direction at θ = 0◦, the present

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
RRPA results and non-relativistic RPAE [4, 15] results
agree very well. Not surprisingly, there is very little dif-
ference in the time delay between the 3p1/2 and 3p3/2
subshells in Ar, indicating that the spin-orbit interaction
is unimportant here . The ECS calculation [5] diﬀers no-
ticeably. This may be attributed to a diﬀerent methodol-
ogy of the time delay determination in this work. Indeed,
all the RRPA and RPAE calculations were performed
for single-photon XUV photoionization. Hence it is the
Wigner time delay that was evaluated in the present
work.
In the ECS calculation [5], the time delay was
computed using correlated two-photon (XUV+IR) above
threshold matrix elements [18]. In such a deﬁnition, the
atomic time delay contains the so-called Coulomb-laser
coupling (CLC) correction.

τa = τW + τCLC ,

(11)

This correction is known to decrease rapidly with a grow-
ing photoelectron energy and is relatively small near the
Cooper minimum. However, it is large near threshold and
will be accounted for in our calculations presented in the
next section. At the ﬁxed photoelectron emission angle
θ = 45◦ (middle panel), the RPAE results [4, 15] and the
present RRPA calculation are still rather close. How-
ever, the ECS calculations is considerably further away
than in the case of θ = 0◦. This deviation can be possi-
bly attributed to further suppression of the ǫd continuum
because of the kinematic node of the f -wave close to 45◦.
We note that the ǫd continuum is converted to the p-
and f -waves by the IR photon absorption in two-color
photoionization experiments. When the angular average
is taken (bottom panel), the diﬀerence between all the
calculations is not so pronounced and they compare rea-
sonably well with the experiment [17]. A more accurate
angular resolved measurement is needed to validate var-
ious theoretical predictions in the directions away from
the polarization axis.

B. Krypton and xenon

The time delay of Kr 4p1/2 and 4p3/2 subshells in
the energy range encompassing the Cooper minimum is
shown in Fig. 2 in the two ﬁxed directions θ = 0◦ and
θ = 45◦. The time delay displays the characteristic dip
near the Cooper minimum but not as deep as in the case
of argon. The depth of the minimum indicates the rel-
ative strength of the nominally weaker channel near the
Cooper minimum of the normally stronger channel. In
the non-relativistic RPAE model, this stronger channel
can be identiﬁed with the 4pm=0 →
ǫd transition. Other
1 in this channel
angular momentum projections m =
are excluded in the θ = 0◦ polarization direction. Away
from this direction, weaker channels 4pm=±1 →
ǫd, along
ǫs channel, also make their contri-
with the 4pm=0 →
bution to the photoionization amplitude and the time
delay. Hence the Cooper minimum in the time delay
is getting shallower. Overall the angular dependence is
much weaker in Kr than in the case of Ar. Nevertheless,
the RRPA calculations show a noticeable deviation from
the RPAE and the spin-orbit splitting of the time delay
becomes visible.

toionization resonances 5s1np [19] and 4d9np [20]. These
resonances cause rapid oscillations of the time delay
which are well resolved in the present RRPA calculation
but not so well in the RPAE [15]. As in the case of Kr,
the relativistic eﬀects are noticeable in Xe. Similar to
other atoms, the Cooper minimum of the time delay is
ﬂattening away from the polarization direction.

C. Near threshold region

The time delay near the threshold is dominated
strongly by the Coulomb singularity. The scattering
phase of the photoelectron propagating in the ﬁeld of
the singly charged parent ion diverges to negative inﬁn-
ity as the photoelectron energy goes to zero [21]. Cor-
respondingly, the photoelectron group delay (the Wigner
time delay) tends to positive inﬁnity near threshold. The
CLC correction has a similar logarithmic singularity [22]
but it is negative. So the total atomic time delay (11) is
the sum of the two divergent terms of the opposite signs.

In the near threshold experiment [7], it is the diﬀerence
of the atomic time delays in the np1/2 and np3/2 subshells
that is measured. Because of the diﬀerent ionization po-
tentials, the photoelectron ejected from the deeper np1/2
subshell has a smaller kinetic energy than the one ionized
from the np3/2 subshell. Hence the Wigner time delay in
the np1/2 subshell is larger than the np3/2 subshell at the
same photon energy. This characteristic behavior is seen
on the top panels of Fig. 4 for Kr and Fig. 5 for Xe. The
same diﬀerence in the photoelectron kinetic energies will
aﬀect the respective CLC corrections to the time delay
in the np1/2 and np3/2 subshells. To account for this ef-
fect, we used the values of τCLC plotted in Fig. 5 of [22]
as a function of the photoelectron energy. We ﬁtted it
with an analytical formula and calculated the diﬀerence

data from [7] are plotted with error bars.

The resulting values of the time delay diﬀerence are
shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 for Kr
and Xe, respectively. In the case of Kr, the angular de-

as can be seen in comparison of the values obtained for
the two ﬁxed scattering angles θ = 0◦ and θ = 45◦. Hence
the values of the atomic time delay diﬀerence τ 3/2

evaluated in the direction of the polarization axis can be
compared with the angular averaged experiment [7]. In
the case of Xe, this diﬀerence is even smaller and not
noticeable in the scale of the bottom panel of Fig. 5.

In comparison to Kr, Xe has smaller ionization thresh-
olds. Hence, at the same photon energy, the photoelec-
trons have larger kinetic energy which take them further
away from the threshold. Therefore, the eﬀect of the
Coulomb singularity on the Wigner time delay and the
CLC correction is weaker. The net atomic time delay
diﬀerence in Xe becomes positive near threshold whereas
it is negative or close to zero in the case of Kr. These
ﬁndings are in line with the experiment [7].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We applied the relativistic formalism and RRPA com-
putational scheme to evaluate the time delay in the va-
lence shell of noble gas atoms, Ar, Kr and Xe. The two
characteristic features of the time delay are analyzed: the
angular dependence near the Cooper minimum and the

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
eﬀect of the spin-orbit splitting near the threshold. Com-
parison with nonrelativistic calculations serves as a con-
venient test and a calibration tool. The eﬀect of the spin-
orbit splitting is not strong near the Cooper minimum
which is relatively far away from the ionization thresh-
old. However, the angular dependence is signiﬁcant in
this photon energy range due to eﬃcient competition of
the nominally weak and strong photoionization channels.
This dependence is most pronounced in Ar. Indirectly,
this angular dependence is conﬁrmed by the angular in-
tegrated experiment [17] which agrees much better with
angular averaged calculations rather than angular spe-
ciﬁc data. In heavier noble gases, Kr and Xe, the angular
dependence also noticeable but not as pronounced as in
Ar.

The time delay in the near-threshold region shows little
or no angular dependence while the spin-orbit splitting
eﬀect is large. At the same photon energy, the photo-
electron ejected from a deeper np1/2 subshell has smaller
kinetic energy and less aﬀected by the Coulomb singu-
larity as its counterpart ejected from the shallower np3/2
subshell. The corresponding diﬀerence in the Wigner

time delays is oﬀset by the diﬀerence in the correction
due to the Coulomb-laser coupling. As a result, the net
atomic delay diﬀerence becomes positive in Xe and re-
mains negative in Kr. These ﬁndings are in line with
recent experimental observations [7].
