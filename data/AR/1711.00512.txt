ABSTRACT 

The simulation of Cherenkov light lateral distribution function (CLLDF) in Extensive Air Showers (EAS) was 
performed by using the Monte Carlo CORSIKA code for  configurations of Tunka-133 EAS Cherenkov array. 
This simulation was carried out for different primary particles (e+, e-, p, O, Ar and Fe) around the knee region 
with  the  energy  3.1015  eV  at  different  zenith  angles.  By  depending  on  the  Breit-Wigner  function  a 
parameterization of CLLDF was reconstructed on the basis of this simulation as a function of the zenith angle. 
The  parameterized  CLLDF  was  verified  for  four  fixed  zenith  angles  in  comparison  with  the  simulation  that 
performed using CORSIKA code for each primary particle. 

Keywords: Cherenkov light; lateral distribution function; extensive air showers.   

1. INTRODUCTION 

The  Cherenkov  radiation  effect  can  be  seen  when 
charged  particles  breaks  through  dielectric  medium, 
such  as  air,  when  exceeds  the  phase  of  light  in  the 
medium (  > c/n), where     is the speed of light;    is 
the  speed  of  the  charged  particles  and     is  the 
refractive  index  of  the  medium.  The  emission  of 
Cherenkov  radiation  can  be  characterized  by  the 
superposition  of  spherical  waves  using  Huygen’s 
principle [1]. 

As shown in the Fig. 1, the radiation is observed only 
in  a  distinctive  cone  with  a  specific  angle  θ  between 
the particle velocity and the emission direction, where 
the Cherenkov angle can be obtained as [1]:

2. TUNKA-133 EAS ARRAY 

Tunka-133 is located in the Tunka valley (50 km from 
Lake  Baikal,  Russia)  with  nearly  1  km geometric 
area  which  designed  to  register  EAS  events  from 
cosmic rays or high energy gamma ray and detect the 
Cherenkov light of air showers during dark and clear 
nights [9, 10]. Tunka-133 array consists of 133 wide-
angle optical detectors on the basis of PMT EMI 9350 
with a hemispherical photocathode of 20 cm diameter. 
The optical detectors in the array are separated by 19 
compact  sub  arrays  that  are  called  clusters,  each 
cluster  composed  of  7  optical  detectors  in  each  one-
six  hexagonally  arranged  detectors  and  one  in  the 
center  [11]. The  distance  between  the  detectors  is  85 
m and the configuration of the array is shown in Fig. 2 
[12].

3.1  The  Simulation 
CORSIKA Code 

of  CLLDF  Using 

CORSIKA  (Cosmic  Ray  Simulations  for  KAscade) 
code  is  a  detailed  Monte  Carlo  program  to  study  the 
evolution  and  properties  of  EAS  in  the  atmosphere 
[13].  In  this  work,  the  simulation  of  CLLDF  was 
performed  by  using  CORSIKA  code  with 
two 
hadronic  models:  QGSJET  (Quark  Gluon  String 
model  with  JETs)  code  [14]  that  was  used  to  model 
interactions  of  hadrons  with  energies  greater  than  80 
GeV  and  GHEISHA  (Gamma  Hadron  Electron 
Interaction  SHower)  code  [15]  which  was  used  for 
energies  lower  than  80  GeV.  The  simulation  of 
the 
CORSIKA  program  was  performed 
configurations of the Tunka-133 for different primary 
particles  (e+,  e-  ,  p,  O,  Ar  and  Fe)  with  the  energy 
3.1015 eV at different zenith angles.

3.2  The  Parameterization

CLLDF 

The number of Cherenkov photons per the interval of 
wavelength  (      ) can be  obtained from the Tamm

At sea level           , and the Cherenkov light can 
be  emitted  by  the  electrons  that  exceed     i.e.  when 
          .  By  neglecting  the  absorption 
of atmospheric Cherenkov radiation, the total number 
of  Cherenkov  photons     ,  which  can  be  radiated by 
electrons will be written as [17]: 

The  relation  (6)  is  utilized  for  experimental  data 
processing as demonstrated by direct measurements of 
Cherenkov radiation.  
The  parameterization  of  the  simulated  CLLDF  was 
performed by a function that proposed in Ref. [8] as a 
function  of  the  distance  R  from  the  shower  axis  and 
zenith angle θ that depended on four parameters a, b, 
σ and ro: 

   (7) 

when 

                                                (4) 

Where  C=103  m-1  is  the  normalization  constant  [20] 
and β is defined as:

where      is  the  critical  energy  that  equals  to  the 
ionization  losses  at  t-unit:              .  For  electron, 
                              ,                     and 
              [18]. 

Therefore, the number of Cherenkov photons in EAS 
shower is directly proportional to the primary particle 
energy.  The  Cherenkov  light  density  of  photons  per 
unit  area  of  the  detector  to  the  primary  energy  of 
particles is given by the relation [19]: 

                                                (6) 

The  estimation  of  Cherenkov  light  density  was 
performed  around  the  knee  region  with  the  energy 
3.1015  eV  at  different  zenith  angles  and  for  different 
primary  particles.  Unlike  Refs.  [21-23],  zenith  angle 
dependence  of  the  parameters  a, b,  σ    and  ro  permits 
us  to  calculate  the  CLLDF  for    any  zenith  angle  and 
fit the LDF which was simulated by CORSIKA code. 
The  zenith  angle  dependence  of 
the  CLLDF 
parameters was approximated by the relation: 

, (9) 

here k() = a, log b, log σ, log r0; where θ is the zenith 
angle;  co,  c1,  c2  and  c3  are  coefficients  that  depended 
on the zenith angle (see Tables 1 and 2).

Fig.  3  demonstrates  the  results  of  the  simulated 
CLLDF  (solid  curves)  in  comparison  with  that 
parameterized  (Dash  lines)  using  Equations  (7)  and 
(8)  with  their  parameters  (Equation  (9))  for  different 
primary  particles  (e-,  e+,  p,  Fe,  O  and  Ar)  at  zenith 
angles   =5°  and  10°.  While  in  Fig.  4  was  shown  the 
results  of  the  simulated  CLLDF  (solid  curves)  in 
comparison  with  that  parameterized  at  zenith  angles 
 =15° and 20° (Dash lines). 

The  parameterized  CLLDF  in  Figs.  3  and  4  for  slant 
EAS  showers  slightly  differs  from  the  simulated 
CLLDF  that  depended  on  the  Tunka133  EAS  array 
configuration.  This  difference  was  identified  by 
minimizing the function:

illustrated in Table 3 for two fixed zenith angles.

5. CONCLUSION 

The  Cherenkov  light  lateral  distribution  function  in 
EAS  was  simulated  using  CORSIKA  code  for 
conditions  and  configurations  of 
the  Tunka-133 
Cherenkov array for different primary particles (e+, e- 
,  p,  O,  Ar  and  Fe)  around  the  knee  region  with  the 
energy 3.1015 eV at different zenith angles. The lateral 
distribution  function  of  Cherenkov  radiation,  which 
was  proposed 
in  Ref.  [6]  was  developed  by 
approximating the results of the numerical simulation 
of  CLLDF  as  a  function  of  the  distance  from  the 
shower  axis  and  zenith  angle  θ.  The  parameterized 
CLLDF  by  using  Equations  (7),  (8)  and  (9)  for  each 
primary  particle  was  verified  with  four  different 
zenith angles (5o, 10o, 15o and 20°). This verification 
was  gave  a  good  agreement  in  comparison  with  the 
simulated CLLDF in the core distance range 2.5-40 m 
and from 150-400  m. There is a partial disagreement 
in  the  range  50-200  m  from  the  shower  axis  because 
the 
of 
CORSIKA  code  simulation  especially.  The  main 
advantage  of  the  given  approach  consists  of  the 
possibility  to  make  a  library  of  LDF  samples  which 
could  be  utilized  for  analysis  of  real  events  which 
detected with the EAS array and reconstruction of the 
primary  cosmic  rays  energy  spectrum  and  mass 
composition.
