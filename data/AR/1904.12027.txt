Abstract Strong solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections, here deﬁned not only as the
bursts of electromagnetic radiation but as the entire process in which magnetic en-
ergy is released through magnetic reconnection and plasma instability, emanate from
active regions (ARs) in which high magnetic non-potentiality resides in a wide vari-
ety of forms. This review focuses on the formation and evolution of ﬂare-productive
ARs from both observational and theoretical points of view. Starting from a general
introduction of the genesis of ARs and solar ﬂares, we give an overview of the key
observational features during the long-term evolution in the pre-ﬂare state, the rapid
changes in the magnetic ﬁeld associated with the ﬂare occurrence, and the physical
mechanisms behind these phenomena. Our picture of ﬂare-productive ARs is sum-
marized as follows: subject to the turbulent convection, the rising magnetic ﬂux in
the interior deforms into a complex structure and gains high non-potentiality; as the
ﬂux appears on the surface, an AR with large free magnetic energy and helicity is
built, which is represented by δ-sunspots, sheared polarity inversion lines, magnetic
ﬂux ropes, etc; the ﬂare occurs when sufﬁcient magnetic energy has accumulated,
and the drastic coronal evolution affects magnetic ﬁelds even in the photosphere. We
show that the improvement of observational instruments and modeling capabilities
has signiﬁcantly advanced our understanding in the last decades. Finally, we discuss
the outstanding issues and future perspective and further broaden our scope to the

1 Introduction

Shin Toriumi, Haimin Wang

Ever since sunspot observations with telescopes started in the beginning of 17th cen-
tury, vast amounts of observational data have been collected. Triggered by the mo-
mentous discovery of solar ﬂares by Carrington (1859) and Hodgson (1859) and by
the report of the existence of magnetic ﬁelds in sunspots by Hale (1908), the close re-
lationship between the production of solar ﬂares and the magnetism of active regions
(ARs) has been extensively argued.

Advances in ground-based and space-borne telescopes have accelerated this trend.
In recent decades, new instruments such as Hinode (Kosugi et al. 2007), Solar Dy-
namics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012), and the Goode Solar Telescope (GST;
Cao et al. 2010)1 have delivered rich observational information and enabled us to
study ﬂares and ARs in unprecedented detail. Moreover, the ever-increasing capa-
bility of numerical simulations performed on supercomputers has improved the ad-
vanced modeling of these phenomena and deepened our understanding of their phys-
ical background.

From experience we know that there are ﬂare-productive and ﬂare-quiet ARs.

Then, some of the key questions are:

– What are the important morphological and magnetic properties of the ﬂare-productive

ARs that differentiate these from ﬂare-quiet ARs?

– What are the key observational features that are created during the course of large-

scale, long-term AR evolution?

– What subsurface dynamics and physical mechanisms produce such observed prop-

erties and features?

– What rapid changes occur in magnetic ﬁelds during the ﬂare eruptions?

The understanding of the ﬂaring of ARs is not only motivated by academic curios-
ity but also desired by the practical demand of space weather forecasts that is growing
more rapidly than ever before. Needless to say, the ﬂaring activity of our host star di-
rectly affects the condition of the near-Earth environment through emitting coronal
mass ejections (CMEs), electromagnetic radiation, and high energy particles.2 As the
successful detection of stellar ﬂares and starspots of solar-like stars is now increasing
more and more, it is a key remaining issue for solar physicists to reveal the conditions
of strong ﬂare eruptions based on the rich information of solar ARs and ﬂares.

Therefore, we set as primary aim of this review article the summary of the cur-
rent understanding of the formation and evolution of ﬂare-productive ARs that has
been brought about through decades of effort of observational and theoretical inves-
tigations. For this aim, we ﬁrst highlight key observational properties of ﬂaring ARs

during the course of long-term and large-scale evolution. We then proceed to the theo-
retical studies that try to understand the physical origins of these observed properties.
We switch our focus to the drastic evolution during the main stage of the ﬂare and
discuss the possibility that the changes in coronal ﬁelds affect the photospheric con-
ditions. After we summarize what we have learned so far, especially in the age with
Hinode, SDO, and GST, our discussion extends further to the possibilities of space
weather forecasting and historical data analysis and even to the connection with stel-
lar ﬂares and CMEs. Although we carefully avoid stepping into the details too much,
we provide references to excellent reviews since the main topic of this article, i.e.,
the development of ﬂaring ARs, is closely related to a wide spectrum of phenomena
from solar dynamo, ﬂux emergence and AR formation to sunspots, ﬂares and CMEs.
The rest of this article is structured as follows. Sect. 2 provides the general intro-
duction to the AR formation, solar ﬂares and CMEs, and their relationships. Sect. 3
reviews the key morphological and magnetic properties of ﬂare-productive ARs that
are observed during the long-term and large-scale evolution. Then, in Sect. 4, we
show the theoretical and numerical attempts to model and understand how these prop-
erties are created. Sect. 5 is dedicated to the discussion on rapid changes associated
with ﬂare eruptions. Finally, the summary and discussion are given in Sects. 6 and 7,
respectively.

2 Active regions and solar ﬂares

Figure 1 shows example images of the Sun. In the southern hemisphere, one may
ﬁnd a large sunspot group (top left: surrounded by a box), in which the magnetic
ﬁeld is strongly concentrated (top middle: magnetogram by SDO’s Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI); Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) and the bright loop
structures are clearly seen in the EUV image (top right: 171 ˚A channel of SDO’s
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA); Lemen et al. 2012). This region, numbered
12192 by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), appeared in
October 2014 as one of the largest spot groups ever observed with a maximum spot
area of 2750 MSH3 and produced numerous solar ﬂares including six X-class events
on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) scale. These cen-
ters of activity are called ARs (see van Driel-Gesztelyi and Green 2015, for the history
of the deﬁnition of ARs). In the simplest cases, ARs take a form of a simple bipole
structure. However, as the detailed observation by Hinode’s Solar Optical Telescope
(SOT; Tsuneta et al. 2008) shows, ARs are sometimes composed of a number of
magnetic elements of various size scales (bottom panels), and the ﬂare productivity
is known to increase with the “complexity” of the ARs.

In this section, we introduce the present knowledge of how the ARs and sunspots
are generated, how they become unstable and produce ﬂares and CMEs, and how
these features, i.e., the spots and ﬂares, are related.

2.1 Flux emergence and AR formation

It is generally thought that ARs are created as a result of the emergence of toroidal
magnetic ﬂux from the deeper convection zone (ﬂux emergence: Parker 1955; Bab-
cock 1961). In most dynamo models (Charbonneau 2010; Brun and Browning 2017),
the toroidal ﬂux is generated and ampliﬁed by turbulence and shear in the tachocline,
the thin shear layer at the base of the solar convection zone. There are alternative pos-
sibilities such as the dynamo working in the near surface shear layer (Brandenburg
2005) and the ampliﬁcation of advected horizontal ﬁelds by convection (Stein and
Nordlund 2012). Magnetic ﬂux systems created through these processes emerge to
the solar surface and eventually generate ARs.

Below we introduce the emergence processes in the interior and to the atmosphere
from both theoretical and observational viewpoints. For more comprehensive discus-
sion, interested readers may also consult the review papers by Fisher et al. (2000),
Charbonneau (2010), and Brun and Browning (2017) that are specialized in mag-
netism in the solar interior, Zwaan (1985) and van Driel-Gesztelyi and Green (2015)
for observational properties, and Archontis (2008), Fan (2009a), Cheung and Isobe
(2014), and Schmieder et al. (2014) that elaborate on theories and models of ﬂux
emergence.

photosphere and erupts into the corona. Normalizing units are H0 = 200 km for length, τ0 = 25 s for time,
and B0 = 300 G for magnetic ﬁeld strength. Image reproduced by permission from Toriumi and Yokoyama

2.1.1 Emergence in the interior: theory

Parker (1955) demonstrated that a horizontal ﬂux tube, a horizontal bundle of mag-
netic ﬁeld lines, will rise due to magnetic buoyancy. Let us assume pressure balance
between inside and outside the thin ﬂux tube,

pe = pi +

B2
8π

,

(1)

where pi and pe are the pressure inside and outside the ﬂux tube, whose average
ﬁeld strength is B. When the plasma is in local thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e.,
Te = Ti = T , the above equation can be rewritten as

ρe = ρi +

B2
8π

m
kBT

,

(2)

where ρ is the density, m mean molecular mass, and kB the Boltzmann constant. It is
obvious from this equation that the ﬂux tube is buoyant (ρi < ρe), and the buoyancy
per unit volume is

fB = (ρe − ρi)g =

B2
8π

mg
kBT

=

B2
8πHp

,

(3)

where Hp = kBT /(mg) is the local pressure scale height.

In most parts of the interior, the plasma-β (≡ 8πp/B2) is (much) greater than
unity. For a magnetic ﬂux at the base of the convection zone with a ﬁeld strength
of 105 G, which is 10 times stronger than the ﬁeld strength that is in equipartition
with the local kinetic energy density, the plasma-β is of the order of 105 (e.g., Fan
2009a). In such a situation, the rising ﬂux can still be affected by external ﬂow ﬁelds
of thermal convection.

A large number of numerical models have been developed and revealed various
physical mechanisms of ﬂux emergence and observed AR characteristics. For ex-
ample, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations show that a horizontal magnetic
layer at the base of the convection zone in mechanical equilibrium can break up and
develop into buoyant magnetic ﬂux tubes through the magnetic buoyancy instability
(Cattaneo and Hughes 1988; Matthews et al. 1995; Fan 2001a). In order to keep the
ﬂux tube coherent, it was suggested that the ﬂux tube needs twist, i.e., the azimuthal
component of the magnetic ﬁeld should wrap around the tube’s axis (Parker 1979a;
Longcope et al. 1996; Moreno-Insertis and Emonet 1996). Abbett et al. (2000) found
that, in 3D simulations, the amount of twist necessary for the tube to retain its co-
herency is reduced substantially comparing to the 2D limit.

The effect of the Coriolis force on the rising ﬂux tube, including the asymmetry
between the leading and following spots of bipolar ARs, has been studied by simula-
tions with the assumption that the ﬂux tube is thin enough that the cross sectional evo-
lution can be neglected (thin ﬂux tube approximation: e.g., Spruit 1981; Choudhuri
and Gilman 1987; Fan et al. 1993; D’Silva and Choudhuri 1993; Caligari et al. 1995).
The emergence in the convective interior and its interaction with the ﬂow ﬁelds have
been considered in simulations that apply the anelastic MHD approximation (e.g.,
Gough 1969; Fan et al. 2003; Fan 2008; Jouve and Brun 2009; Nelson et al. 2011;
Weber et al. 2011; Jouve et al. 2013). The top panels of Fig. 2 illustrate the anelastic
simulation by Nelson et al. (2013), who modeled the buoyant rise of Ω-shaped loops
generated self-consistently from a bundle of toroidal ﬂux (magnetic wreath).

However, these assumptions become inappropriate in the uppermost convection
zone above a depth of about 20 Mm (Fan 2009a). This difﬁculty motivated Toriumi
and Yokoyama (2010, 2011) to conduct fully-compressible MHD simulations that
seamlessly connect the different atmospheric layers from a depth of 40 Mm in the
interior to the solar corona. They found that, as illustrated in 3D models in Fig. 2(d–
f), the rising ﬂux tube, starting at −20 Mm, temporarily slows down and undergoes
horizontal expansion (pancaking) while generating escaping plasma ﬂows before it
resumes emergence into the photosphere and beyond. This process, termed “two-step
emergence,” is widely observed in the larger-scale models from the interior to the
atmosphere (see Sect. 3.3.5 of Cheung and Isobe 2014). As an alternative approach,
Abbett and Fisher (2003) and Chen et al. (2017) joined global-scale anelastic models
and local MHD simulations from the near-surface layer upwards and investigated
fuller history of emergence.

2.1.2 Emergence in the interior: observation

Several attempts have been made to detect the subsurface emerging magnetic ﬂux us-
ing local helioseismology (see review by Gizon and Birch 2005). One of the earliest
works, Braun (1995), reported on the p-mode scattering starting about two days be-
fore the spot formation in the emerging AR NOAA 5247. The following case studies
mainly focused on the wave-speed perturbation and subsurface ﬂow ﬁelds before the
ﬂux appearance: Chang et al. (1999), Jensen et al. (2001), Komm et al. (2008), Koso-
vichev and Duvall (2008), Zharkov and Thompson (2008), and Kosovichev (2009).
However, in most cases, it was difﬁcult to detect signiﬁcant seismic signatures asso-
ciated with the emerging ﬂux, probably because of the fast rising motion and accord-
ingly short observation time, which leads to low signal-to-noise ratio.

A recent observation by Ilonidis et al. (2011), however, detected strong seismic
perturbations in NOAA 10488 at depths between 42 and 75 Mm, up to two days
before the photospheric ﬂux reaches its maximum ﬂux growth rate. The estimated
rising speed from 65 Mm to the surface is about 0.6 km s−1 (see also Braun 2012;
Ilonidis et al. 2013; Kholikov 2013; Kosovichev et al. 2018). Statistical studies by
Komm et al. (2009, 2011b, 2012) showed indications of upﬂows, rotations, and in-
creased vorticity in the subsurface layer. Leka et al. (2013), Birch et al. (2013), and
Barnes et al. (2014) analyzed more than 100 emerging regions and found that there
are statistically signiﬁcant seismic signatures in average subsurface ﬂows and the ap-
parent wave speed, at least one day prior to the emergence, although their individual
samples did not show discernible signal greater than the noise level.

Other possible precursors of ﬂux emergence on the surface are the reduction in
acoustic oscillation power (Hartlep et al. 2011; Toriumi et al. 2013b), f-mode am-
pliﬁcation (Singh et al. 2016), and horizontal divergent ﬂows (Toriumi et al. 2012,
2014a).

2.1.3 Birth of ARs: observation

As the rising magnetic ﬂux reaches the photosphere, it starts to build up an AR if
the ﬂux is sufﬁciently large. Figure 3(a) and its accompanying movie show various
aspects of a newly emerging ﬂux region. In a magnetogram (Stokes-V/I map), the
emerging ﬂux is scattered throughout the region as a number of small-scale magnetic
elements of positive and negative polarities. These elements merge with and cancel
each other in the middle of the region and gradually form pores and, if the emerged
ﬂux is sufﬁcient, they eventually create sunspots (Zwaan 1978). Zwaan (1985) in-
troduced the hierarchy of magnetic elements. Sunspots with a ﬂux of 5 × 1020 Mx
or more have a penumbra and the umbral ﬁeld is 2900–3300 G, sometimes exceed-
ing 4000 G, while the ﬂux of pores is 2.5 × 1019–5 × 1020 Mx and the ﬁeld strength
is ∼ 2000 G. If the ﬂux is less than 1020 Mx, the emerging regions do not develop
beyond ephemeral regions (Harvey and Martin 1973).

From the observation of repeated emergence and cancellation of photospheric
magnetic elements, Strous et al. (1996) and Strous and Zwaan (1999) suggested that
this behavior is due to the rising of undulatory (sea-serpent) ﬁeld lines. Georgoulis
et al. (2002), Bernasconi et al. (2002), and Pariat et al. (2004) suggested that Ellerman

bombs, the bursty intensity enhancements in Hα line wings (Ellerman 1917), are
located at the dipped parts, at which magnetic reconnection takes place to disconnect
emerged ﬂux from un-emerged, mass-laden parts of the ﬂux tube (resistive emergence
model). UV bursts in the transition region lines are similarly found at the cancellation

sites (Peter et al. 2014; Young et al. 2018). Brightenings seen in 1400 ˚A, 1600 ˚A, and
Ca II H of Fig. 3(a) correspond to Ellerman bombs and UV bursts.

Soon after the magnetic ﬂux shows up, an arch ﬁlament system (AFS) appears
as parallel dark ﬁbrils, probably the manifestation of rising magnetic ﬁelds (Bruzek
1967, 1969, see Mg II k3 image of Fig. 3(a)). Bipolar plages are observed in the
chromospheric Ca II H and K lines at the footpoints of the AFS (Kawaguchi and
Kitai 1976, brightenings above the pores in Fig. 3(a)). The Hinode analysis of AFS
by Otsuji et al. (2007, 2010) shows the horizontal expansion and upward accelera-
tion of emerging ﬂux, which strongly supports the “two-step emergence” scenario
(Sect. 2.1.1). The observational characteristics of emerging ﬂux regions are schemat-
ically summarized by Shibata et al. (1989) as an illustration in Fig. 3(b).

2.1.4 Birth of ARs: theory

The MHD modeling of ﬂux emergence from the photospheric layer to the corona
was pioneered by Shibata et al. (1989), who simulated the 2D emergence due to
the Parker instability, the undular mode of the magnetic buoyancy instability (Parker
1979a). They successfully reproduced the observed dynamical features such as rising
motion of the AFS and the strong downﬂow along the ﬁeld lines. Since then, the ﬂux
emergence process has been widely studied both in 2D and 3D (e.g., Shibata et al.
1990; Kaisig et al. 1990; Nozawa et al. 1992; Magara 2001; Matsumoto and Shibata
1992; Matsumoto et al. 1993; Fan 2001b; Magara and Longcope 2001; Archontis
et al. 2004; Isobe et al. 2005; Murray et al. 2006).

Figure 4 shows a typical example of ﬂux emergence simulations by Fan (2001b),
which models the buoyant rise of a twisted ﬂux tube from just beneath the photo-
sphere (−1.5 Mm) and upwards. The initial ﬂux tube, which is horizontal and en-
dowed with a density deﬁcit at the middle with respect to the surroundings, starts
rising due to the magnetic buoyancy and deforms into an Ω-loop (panel a). As the
ﬂux tube penetrates into the upper atmosphere, a ying-yang pattern of positive and
negative polarities (vertical ﬁeld Bz) is produced in the photosphere (panels c–e),
which resembles the polarity layout in the actual AR (panel g). Due to the initial
twist, magnetic ﬁeld lines in the atmosphere show a twisted structure, which also
mimics the observed helical nature of the AFS (panel i).

Forbes and Priest (1984) and Yokoyama and Shibata (1995, 1996) investigated
the interaction between emerging ﬂux and the preexisting coronal loop (the model
proposed by Heyvaerts et al. 1977) and successfully reproduced jet ejections (see
also Miyagoshi and Yokoyama 2003; Moreno-Insertis et al. 2008; Nishizuka et al.
2008; Murray et al. 2009; Archontis et al. 2010; Takasao et al. 2013; Moreno-Insertis
and Galsgaard 2013). Magnetic ﬂux cancellation at the emerging undular ﬁelds and
the resultant production of Ellerman bombs were modeled by Isobe et al. (2007) in
2D and Archontis and Hood (2009) in 3D.

With the growing ability of computation resources, simulations have become
more realistic and now take into account the effect of thermal convection on ﬂux
emergence. For instance, Cheung et al. (2008) performed 3D radiative MHD simula-
tions of the emergence of an initially horizontal ﬂux tube in the granular convection.
They found that, due to vigorous convective ﬂows at the top of the convection zone,

the rising tube is highly structured by the surface granulation pattern, which is well in
agreement with the Hinode/SOT observations. The series of numerical simulations of
similar setups consistently showed that the granular cells are expanded and elongated
as the horizontal ﬂux approaches and that the surface convection makes undular ﬁeld
lines (dipped ﬁeld at the downﬂow lanes), which reconnect with each other and drain
down the plasma from the surface layer (Abbett 2007; Cheung et al. 2007; Isobe
et al. 2008; Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2008, 2009; Tortosa-Andreu and Moreno-Insertis
2009; Fang et al. 2010). The realistic modeling by Archontis and Hansteen (2014) and
Hansteen et al. (2017) successfully reproduced the small-scale reconnection events at
the dipped ﬁelds and showed that they can be observed as Ellerman bombs or UV
bursts depending on the reconnection heights. Throughout these processes, the mag-
netic elements grow larger and, eventually, the sunspots are formed (Cheung et al.
2010; Rempel and Cheung 2014).

2.2 Solar ﬂares and CMEs

In most astronomical contexts, the term “ﬂare” refers to the abrupt increase in in-
tensity of electromagnetic waves, and the ﬂares on the Sun are detected over a wide
range of spectrum such as X-rays, (E)UV, radio, and even white light. In fact, the
discovery of ﬂares was made as a remarkable intensity enhancement in white light
(Carrington event on 1859 September 1; Carrington 1859; Hodgson 1859). Figure 5
is the original whole-disk drawing by Carrington, which shows a large spot group that
produced the strong white light ﬂare. Nowadays, ﬂare strengths are grouped by peak
soft X-ray ﬂux over 1–8 ˚A, measured by GOES, into logarithmic classes A, B, C,
M, X, corresponding to 10−8, 10−7, 10−6, 10−5, 10−4 W m−2 at Earth, respectively,
so X1.2 and M3.4 represent 1.2 × 10−4 W m−2 and 3.4 × 10−5 W m−2, respectively.

The Carrington ﬂare is arguably considered as the most powerful event ever with the
estimated magnitude of X45 (±5) and bolometric energy of 5 × 1032 erg (Tsurutani
et al. 2003; Cliver and Svalgaard 2004; Boteler 2006; Cliver and Dietrich 2013).

Solar ﬂares are now considered as the conversion process of (free) magnetic en-
ergy to kinetic and thermal energy as well as particle acceleration, most probably
through magnetic reconnection. Figure 6 shows the GOES X3.4-class ﬂare in AR
NOAA 10930. From this ﬁgure and the corresponding movie, one may ﬁnd that the
ﬂare occurs between the two major sunspots, particularly at the polarity inversion
line (PIL: also called the neutral line), where the vertical ﬁeld Bz or the line-of-sight
(LOS) ﬁeld BLOS remains zero and the sign ﬂips across it. The most pronounced fea-
ture is the pair of ﬂare ribbons that spreads along and away from the PIL (Bruzek
1964; Asai et al. 2004). The magnetic ﬁeld in the corona, which is computation-
ally extrapolated from the photospheric magnetogram using the non-linear force-free
ﬁeld (NLFFF) method (Sect. 4.3.1), shows a helical topology above the PIL. Such a
highly non-potential, twisted magnetic structure called a magnetic ﬂux rope is often
observed in soft X-rays prior to the ﬂare occurrence (see Sect. 3.3.1).

Various observational characteristics of the ﬂares, not only the ribbons and the
ﬂux rope but also the cusp-shaped loops seen in soft X-rays (Tsuneta et al. 1992),
hard X-ray loop-top source (Masuda et al. 1994), inﬂows toward a current sheet
(Yokoyama et al. 2001), etc., altogether lend support to the well-established ﬂare
model based on the magnetic reconnection scenario, referred to as the standard model,
or the CSHKP model after its major contributors (Carmichael 1964; Sturrock 1966;
Hirayama 1974; Kopp and Pneuman 1976, see Fig. 7(a)). In this paradigm and its
updated versions (e.g., Forbes and Malherbe 1986; Shibata et al. 1995; Aulanier et al.
2012; Janvier et al. 2013), the key features are explained as follows. The magnetic
ﬂux rope becomes unstable and erupts into the higher atmosphere, entraining the
overlying coronal ﬁeld. The legs of the coronal ﬁeld are drawn into a current sheet
underneath the ﬂux rope as inﬂows and reconnect with each other. The outﬂows from
the reconnection region further boost the ﬂux rope eruption. The post-reconnection
ﬁeld lines form a cusp structure, while the accelerated electrons from the reconnec-
tion site precipitate along the ﬁeld lines and heat the chromosphere to produce ﬂare
ribbons.

The ﬂux rope, if ejected successfully, expands and develops into the magnetic
skeleton of a CME that travels through interplanetary space. This is well demon-
strated by in-situ observations of magnetic ﬁelds at vantage points, e.g., in front of
the Earth (Burlaga et al. 1981; Klein and Burlaga 1982; Marubashi 1986). Fig. 7(b)
shows a schematic illustration of the inferred topology. The helical nature of the mag-
netic ﬁeld of the CMEs is strongly suggestive of their solar origins.

Regarding the onset of ﬂux rope eruption and subsequent ejection of CMEs, var-
ious theories have extensively been proposed and investigated, such as ﬂux emer-
gence (Heyvaerts et al. 1977), breakout (Antiochos et al. 1999; DeVore and An-
tiochos 2008), tether-cutting (Moore et al. 2001), emerging-ﬂux trigger (Chen and
Shibata 2000), kink instability (T¨or¨ok and Kliem 2005; Fan and Gibson 2007), and
torus instability (Kliem and T¨or¨ok 2006), along with a more recent concept of the
double-arc instability (Ishiguro and Kusano 2017). In any case, there appears to be
a consensus, at least, that the ﬂare/CME occurrence is caused through the dynami-

cal coupling between the unstable eruption of a ﬂux rope (ideal MHD process) and
magnetic reconnection of surrounding arcades (resistive MHD process).

It should be noted, however, that not all the stronger ﬂares are accompanied by
CMEs (e.g., Yashiro et al. 2006). The best example is the giant AR NOAA 12192
(Fig. 1). Throughout the disk passage, this AR produced numerous energetic ﬂares
including the six X-class ones, but surprisingly none of them were CME-eruptive.
Sun et al. (2015) showed that in this AR, the decay index n = −∂ln Bh/∂ln z, which
measures the decreasing rate of the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld Bh with height z, re-

mains below the critical value nc ≈ 1.5 for the torus instability until a large altitude
and thus only failed eruptions took place (Inoue et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2016a; Amari
et al. 2018). The conﬁnement of ﬂux rope eruption by strong overlying ﬁeld is also
shown by the statistical studies on a number of ARs (Wang et al. 2017a; Vasantharaju
et al. 2018; Jing et al. 2018). The same mechanism explains the observed result by
Toriumi et al. (2017b) that the ratio of reconnected ﬂux (in the ﬂare ribbons) to the
total AR ﬂux is, on average, smaller for failed events than eruptive cases. DeRosa and
Barnes (2018) showed that X-class ﬂares located near coronal ﬁelds that are open to
the heliosphere are eruptive at a higher rate than those lacking access to open ﬁelds.
The topics we have discussed above are only the most representative aspects of
the ﬂares and CMEs. In order to keep our primary focus on the formation and evolu-
tion of ﬂare-productive ARs, however, we stop the discussion at this point and yield
the rest to reviews by, e.g., Schrijver (2009), Fletcher et al. (2011), and Benz (2017)
for observational overviews and Priest and Forbes (2002), Forbes et al. (2006), Chen
(2011), Shibata and Magara (2011), and Janvier et al. (2015) for theoretical and mod-
eling aspects.

2.3 Categorizations of sunspots and ﬂare productivity

The number of sunspots varies with the 11 year solar activity cycle (Schwabe 1843;
Hathaway 2015). Early in a cycle, the spots appear in higher latitudes up to 40◦
and, throughout the cycle, the latitude gradually drifts lower to the equator (Sp¨orer’s
law: Carrington 1858). This behavior is illustrated by the Maunder butterﬂy diagram
(Fig. 8 top). In each bipolar AR, the preceding spot tends to appear closer to the equa-
tor than the following spot (Joy’s rule: Hale et al. 1919). As the magnetic observation
started in the beginning of 20th century (Hale 1908), Hale’s polarity rule was dis-
covered: for each cycle, the bipolar ARs are aligned in the east-west orientation with
opposite preceding magnetic polarities on the opposite hemispheres. Soon, they also
noticed that the polarities of the preceding spots alternate between successive cycles
and these features are now altogether called Hale-Nicholson rule (Fig. 8 bottom: Hale
and Nicholson 1925).

Along with such long-term characteristics, which impose strong constraints on
dynamo models, the structure of each sunspot group is also recognized as an impor-
tant factor (see reviews by Solanki 2003; Borrero and Ichimoto 2011). One method of
categorizing the sunspots is the Zurich classiﬁcation (Cortie 1901; Waldmeier 1938),
which was further developed as the McIntosh classiﬁcation (McIntosh 1990). The
McIntosh classiﬁcation uses three letters to describe the white-light properties of the
spots, which are the size, penumbral type, and distribution (see Fig. 9). The combina-
tion of the three letters shows the morphological complexity of ARs and, according
to Bornmann and Shaw (1994), the ﬂare production rate increases along the diagonal
line in the 3D parameter space from the simplest corner “A/B/Hxx” to the most com-
plex end “Fkc”. Other studies show essentially a consistent result: morphologically
complex ARs produce more ﬂares (e.g., Atac 1987; Gallagher et al. 2002; Ternullo
et al. 2006; Norquist 2011; Lee et al. 2012; McCloskey et al. 2016). The primary

Schematic diagram showing the polarity alignments. The preceding spots appear closer to the equator than
the following spots (Joy’s rule). In each cycle, the preceding polarities on one hemisphere are the same
and are opposite to those on the other hemisphere, and the order of the polarities reverses in the successive
cycle (Hale-Nicholson rule). These are merely the overall trends and there exist many exceptional ARs.

advantage of this method is that the spots are categorized simply from the white light
observation and thus it requires no magnetic measurement.4

Another categorization method is the Mount Wilson classiﬁcation, which refers to
the magnetic structures of ARs. The original scheme of this method has the following
three identiﬁers (Fig. 10 top: Hale et al. 1919; Hale and Nicholson 1938):

– α, a unipolar spot group;
– β, a simple bipolar spot group of both positive and negative polarities; and
– γ, a complex spot group in which spots of both polarities are distributed so irreg-

ularly as to prevent classiﬁcation as a β group.

Often more than one identiﬁer is appended to each AR to indicate even more com-
plex structures, such as βγ, a bipolar spot group which is so complex that preceding
or following spots are accompanied by minor polarities. It was shown that the ﬂare
productivity is related to this categorization. Giovanelli (1939) found that the prob-
ability of the ﬂare eruption is proportional to the spot area and it increases with the
spot complexity (in the order of α, β, βγ, and γ). Consistent results were reported by
Kleczek (1953), Bell and Glazer (1959), and Greatrix (1963).

4 McIntosh (1990) mentioned that “[r]arely will the measured magnetic class conﬂict with” his deﬁni-

tions of unipolar and bipolar groups.

sion from McIntosh (1990), copyright by ***.

Later, the δ group, a spot group in which umbrae of opposite polarities are sep-
arated by less than 2◦ and situated within the common penumbra, was added to the
Mount Wilson classiﬁcation by K¨unzel (1960, 1965). In this scheme, the most com-
plex ARs are the spots appended with βγδ. Ever since K¨unzel (1960) showed that
the δ-spots are highly ﬂare-productive, a number of statistical investigations have
been carried out and showed consistent results (e.g. Mayﬁeld and Lawrence 1985;
Sammis et al. 2000; Tian et al. 2002; Ternullo et al. 2006; Guo et al. 2014; Toriumi
et al. 2017b; Yang et al. 2017b). The bottom panel of Fig. 10 is a diagram of the peak
GOES soft X-ray ﬂux vs. the maximum sunspot area for various ARs by Sammis
et al. (2000). Here, one may easily ﬁnd the clear positive correlation that the ﬂare
magnitude increases with the spot area. However, this diagram also shows that more
complex regions produce stronger ﬂares. For example, all ≥X4-class ﬂares occur in
ARs of area greater than 1000 MSH and classiﬁed as the most complex βγδ. Other
studies show the correlations and associations between the δ-spots and the produc-
tion of proton ﬂares (here meaning that ﬂares that emit energetic protons: Warwick
1966; Sakurai 1970), white-light ﬂares (Neidig and Cliver 1983), γ-ray ﬂares (Xu
et al. 1991), and fast CMEs (Wang and Zhang 2008).

Yet another important ﬁnding is that the inverted or anti-Hale spot groups, i.e.,
the ARs violating Hale’s polarity rule, are ﬂare productive (Smith and Howard 1968;
Zirin 1970; Tang 1982). In most cases, polarities of ARs follow the Hale-Nicholson
rule described earlier in this subsection and the spot groups violating this rule are very

1989; Khlystova and Sokoloff 2009; Stenﬂo and Kosovichev 2012; McClintock et al.
2014). However, it is known that once this structure is created, an AR tends to pro-
duce strong ﬂares. For example, Tian et al. (2002) selected the 25 most violent ARs
in Cycles 22 and 23 based on ﬁve criteria: the largest spot area > 1000 MSH; X-ray
ﬂare index (related to the sum of peak ﬂare intensities) > 5.0; 10.7 cm radio ﬂux
> 1000 s.f.u.; proton ﬂux (> 10 MeV) > 400 p.f.u.; and geomagnetic Ap index > 50.
They found that most of them (68%) violate the Hale-Nicholson rule. Surveying 104
δ-spots, Tian et al. (2005a) showed that about 34% violate the Hale’s rule but fol-
low the hemispheric current helicity rule, which describes the dominance of negative
(positive) current helicity in the northern (southern) hemisphere (e.g., Pevtsov et al.
1995, see also Sect. 3.3.3). Tian et al. (2005a) found that such ARs have a much
stronger tendency to produce X-class ﬂares.

In this subsection, we reviewed several schemes of sunspot categorization and
showed that ARs producing larger ﬂares tend to have: a larger spot area; morpho-
logical and magnetic complexity, which is qualitatively indicated by McIntosh and
Mount Wilson schemes; and anti-Hale alignment. However, for producing strong
ﬂares, probably it is not enough to satisfy just one of these conditions. For exam-
ple, the largest-ever sunspot since the late 19th century, RGO (Royal Greenwich Ob-
servatory) 14886 on April 1947 (maximum spot area of 6132 MSH), is reported as
ﬂare quiet. The spot image shown in Fig. 3 of Aulanier et al. (2013) indicates that
this region has a simple bipolar structure (β-spot). On the other hand, the fourth
largest in history, RGO 14585 on July 1946 (4279 MSH) as in Fig. 11, produced
great ﬂares and geomagnetic storms with a ground-level enhancement (Ellison 1946;
Forbush 1946; Dodson and Hedeman 1949). The spot image reveals that this region
is strongly packed as if it is a δ-spot and, judging from the Mount Wilson drawing,
it is very likely true. Therefore, it is important to ﬁnd if there exist critical conditions
for the strong ﬂares and, if so, what they are, by conducting observational and theo-
retical studies of any kinds to investigate the magnetic structure of ﬂaring ARs and
their evolution.

3 Long-term and large-scale evolution: observational aspects

Observationally, the changes of magnetic ﬁelds that are associated with ﬂares are
often divided into two regimes: the long-term, gradual evolution of large-scale ﬁelds
and the rapid changes associated with (i.e., in the time scales comparable to) the ﬂare
occurrence. In what follows (Sects. 3 and 4), we review the ﬁrst topic, the long-term
evolution, which is essentially related to the energy build-up process in the pre-ﬂare
state.

3.1 Formation and development of δ-spots

The role of long-term magnetic development in ﬂare production was ﬁrst recog-
nized by Martres et al. (1968), who pointed out that the ﬂares are often associated
with evolving magnetic structures (Structure magn´etique ´evolutive) of opposite po-
larities, in which one is growing and the other decreasing. Through accumulating a
vast amount of observational data, observers gradually found certain regularities of
ﬂare-productive ARs. After 18 years of observations at Big Bear Solar Observatory
(BBSO), Zirin and Liggett (1987) summarized and classiﬁed the formation of δ-spots
that produce great ﬂares in three ways:

– Type 1: A complex of spots emerging all at once with different dipoles inter-
twined. This type is tightly packed with a large umbra and called “island δ
sunspot”;

– Type 2: A single δ-spot produced by emergence of satellite spots near large older

spots; and

– Type 3: A δ-conﬁguration formed by collision between two separate but growing
bipoles. The overall polarity layout is quadrupolar and the preceding spot of one
bipole collides with the following spot of the other.

Figure 12 shows two typical examples of Type 1. The AR in Fig. 12(a), McMath
11976, appeared in August 1972 and produced great ﬂares (Zirin and Tanaka 1973).
This region emerged as a tight complex of sunspots with inverted magnetic polar-
ity (i.e., anti-Hale region). The negative spot P1 pushed into the positive spots (F1,
F2, and F3) and caused steep magnetic gradient on the central PIL. The ﬁlament on
the north (ﬁl 1), which may be the extension of the central PIL, repeatedly erupted
due to the continuous spot motion. Another example is NOAA 5395 in March 1989
(Fig. 12(b): Wang et al. 1991). This region also had a closely packed structure of
multiple spots and produced great ﬂares including X4.5 (March 10) and X10 (March
12). This region is known to produce the geomagnetic storm that triggered the severe
power outage in Quebec, Canada, on March 13 to 14 (e.g., Allen et al. 1989; Cliver
and Dietrich 2013). The analysis shows that, at one edge of the large positive spot F1,
negative polarities successively emerged and moved around the main spots, creating
a clockwise spiraling penumbral ﬁelds around it (Wang et al. 1991; Tang and Wang
1993; Ishii et al. 1998). The series of strong ﬂares occurred along the PIL surrounding
the main positive spots. Similar island-δ sunspots are observed to show signiﬁcant
ﬂaring activity, such as ﬂares in McMath 13043 (July 1974), X20 event in NOAA
5629 (August 1989), X13 in NOAA 5747 (October 1989), and X12 in NOAA 6659
(June 1991) (Tanaka 1991; Tang and Wang 1993; Schmieder et al. 1994).

Type 2 events are the ﬂare eruptions caused by the newly emerging satellite spots
in the penumbra of an existing spot (Rust 1968), and Zirin and Liggett (1987) clas-
siﬁed spot groups Mount Wilson 19469 and 20130 into this category (Patterson and
Zirin 1981; Tang 1983). Figure 13 shows a clear example of this type, NOAA 10930
in December 2006 (Kubo et al. 2007). Within the southern penumbra of the main
negative spot, a positive spot appears and drifts around to the east with showing a
counter-clockwise rotation. As a result, an X3.4-class ﬂare occurred on December

corresponding movie).

Figure 14 shows NOAA 11158 in February 2011, the typical case of Type 3 δ-
spot (Toriumi et al. 2014b). Because of the collision of two emerging bipoles P1–
N1 and P2–N2, a highly sheared PIL with steep magnetic gradient is produced in
the central δ-spot (N1 and P2) and a series of ﬂares including the X2.2-class event
(February 15) occur. Similar structures are seen in a variety of ARs, such as NOAA
8562/8567, 6850, 7220/7222, 10314, and 10488 (van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2000;
K´alm´an 2001; Morita and McIntosh 2005; Poisson et al. 2013; Liu and Zhang 2006).
How are these complex structures formed? Zirin and Liggett (1987) mentioned
that “because Types 1 and 2 erupt in the same place, and Type 3 requires large dipoles
that are not close by mere accident, the δ conﬁguration must be the product of a
subsurface phenomenon.” However, we cannot directly observe below the surface.

One way to reconstruct the 3D topology of emerging magnetic ﬁelds is to study it
using sequential images (e.g., white light and magnetograms). For example, Tanaka
(1991) studied the evolution of ﬂare-active Type 1 δ-spots McMath 13043 and 11976
and explained the observed proper motions, the non-Hale spots turning to obey it, by
the emergence of knotted twisted ﬂux tubes (twisted knot model: Fig. 15(a)). This

scenario was supported by many successive researchers (e.g., Fig. 15(b)) and it was
suggested that the deformation of emerging Ω-loops is due to the helical kink in-
stability (e.g., Lites et al. 1995; Leka et al. 1996; L´opez Fuentes et al. 2000, 2003;
Holder et al. 2004; Tian et al. 2005a,b; Nandy 2006; Takizawa and Kitai 2015) (see
Sect. 4.1.1 for theoretical investigations on the kink instability and Appendix A for
the story of the original advocates of this instability as the formation mechanism of
the δ-spots). Poisson et al. (2013) explained the formation of Type 3 δ-spot NOAA
10314 as the ascent of a single large Ω-loop whose top is curled downward and has

a U-loop below the photosphere (Fig. 15(c); see also Pevtsov and Longcope 1998;
van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. 2000; Takizawa and Kitai 2015). Ishii et al. (2000) and
Kurokawa et al. (2002) even used ﬂexible wires to manually model the inferred 3D
conﬁgurations (Fig. 16). From vertically stacked sequential magnetograms, Chint-
zoglou and Zhang (2013) inferred the subsurface topology of NOAA 11158 (Fig. 14).
These observations consistently show that the emerging ﬂux tubes of δ-spots do not
have a simple Ω-shape but are deformed within the convection zone, prior to emer-
gence.

Toriumi et al. (2017b) surveyed all ≥M5-class ﬂares within 45◦ from disk center
for six years from May 2010 and classiﬁed the host ARs into four groups depending
on their developments (Fig. 17): (1) Spot-spot, a complex, compact δ-spot, in which
a large long, sheared PIL extends across the whole AR (equivalent to Type 1 δ-spot);

(2) Spot-satellite, in which a newly emerging bipole appears in the vicinity of a preex-
isting main spot (i.e., Type 2); and (3) Quadrupole, a δ-spot is created by the collision
of two bipoles (i.e., Type 3). However, they also noticed that even X-class events do
not require δ-spots or strong-gradient PILs. Instead, some events occur between two
independent ARs, situations called (4) Inter-AR events (Dodson and Hedeman 1970).
For example, the X1.2 event on 2014 January 7 occurred between NOAA 11944 and
11943 (M¨ostl et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015). Figure 17 also provides possible 3D
topologies, which were later modeled by numerical simulations (see Sect. 4.1.5).

Through the analysis of Mount Wilson classiﬁcations from 1992 to 2015, Jaeggli
and Norton (2016) discussed the possible production mechanism of complex ARs.

They found that while the fractions of α- and β-spots remain constant over cycles
(about 20% and 80%, respectively), that of complex ARs appended with γ and/or δ
increases drastically from 10% at solar minimum to more than 30% at maximum.
According to the authors, this may indicate that complex ARs are produced by the
collision of simpler ARs around the surface layer through the higher rate of ﬂux emer-
gence during solar maximum. This idea may be related to the successive emergence
model (Kurokawa 1987) and perhaps to the concepts of “complexes of activities”
and “sunspot nests” (Bumba and Howard 1965; Gaizauskas et al. 1983; Castenmiller
et al. 1986; Gaizauskas et al. 1994).

3.2 Photospheric features

3.2.1 Strong-ﬁeld, strong-gradient, highly-sheared PILs and magnetic channels

Because ﬂares are the release of magnetic energy via magnetic reconnection, it is
natural that these events are observed around the PILs, where the electric currents
are strongly enhanced (see, e.g., Fig. 6). Since this fact was ﬁrst pointed out by Sev-

Flare-productive active regions

29

erny (1958), the importance of the PILs in the ﬂare occurrence has been repeatedly
emphasized (e.g., Zirin and Tanaka 1973; Hagyard et al. 1984; Wang et al. 1996;
Schrijver 2007). The photospheric characteristics of the ﬂaring PILs are summarized
as follows.

Strong ﬁeld: Both the vertical ﬁelds surrounding the PIL and the transverse ﬁelds
along the PIL are very strong. Tanaka (1991) and Zirin and Wang (1993b) re-
ported on the detection of strong transverse ﬁelds of up to 4300 G (see also Jaeg-
gli 2016; Wang et al. 2018a). Livingston et al. (2006) also pointed out that part
of the exceptionally strong ﬁelds they found are likely related to the transverse
ﬁelds in light bridges of δ-spots (i.e., PILs). Okamoto and Sakurai (2018) no-
ticed the ﬁelds as high as 6250 G in a PIL, which is probably the highest value
ever measured on the Sun including the sunspot umbrae.

Strong gradient: The horizontal gradient of the vertical ﬁeld across the PIL is steep,
indicating that positive and negative polarities are tightly pressed against each
other (Moreton and Severny 1968; Wang et al. 1991, 1994b). The gradient is
sometimes up to several 100 G Mm−1 (Wang and Li 1998; Jing et al. 2006; Song
et al. 2009).

Strong shear: The transverse ﬁeld is directed almost parallel to the PIL. The shear
angle is often measured in the frame where 0◦ is the azimuth of a potential ﬁeld
(Hagyard et al. 1984; Lu et al. 1993), and large shears of 80◦ to 90◦ are observed
at ﬂaring PILs (Hagyard et al. 1990; Hagyard 1990). Figure 18 clearly shows that
the transverse ﬁelds at the PIL of NOAA 10930 are along the direction of the PIL
(marked by the box).

The strong-ﬁeld, strong-gradient, highly-sheared PILs may be the direct manifes-
tation of non-potentiality of magnetic ﬁelds and, therefore, these features are often
used for the prediction of ﬂares and CMEs. Falconer et al. (2002, 2006) measured the
lengths of PILs of, e.g., strong transverse ﬁeld (> 150 G), large shear angle (> 45◦),
and steep gradient (> 50 G Mm−1) and demonstrated that these parameters predict
the occurrence of CMEs. Schrijver (2007) evaluated the total unsigned ﬂux near the
strong-gradient PILs and showed that it gives the upper limit of possible GOES ﬂare
class.

Another important feature of the ﬂaring PILs is the “magnetic channel”, which is
an alternating pattern of elongated positive and negative polarities (Zirin and Wang
1993a; Wang et al. 2002a). Figure 18 displays the magnetic channel in NOAA 10930
(see PIL marked by the box). Wang et al. (2008) and Lim et al. (2010) showed that
high resolution with high polarimetric accuracy is needed to adequately resolve such
small-scale structures (width . 1′′). Figure 19 clearly shows that the pre-ﬂare bright-
ening continues around this structure and the ﬂare ribbons originate from here (see
also the movie of Fig. 6). From these observations, Bamba et al. (2013) suggested
that such ﬁne-scale magnetic structures galvanize the whole system into producing
ﬂare eruptions (Toriumi et al. 2013a; Bamba et al. 2017; Bamba and Kusano 2018).
The signiﬁcance of the sheared PIL, magnetic channel, and small-scale trigger
was also veriﬁed by a super high-resolution observation by BBSO/GST. Figure 20
shows the GST/NIRIS magnetogram of AR NOAA 12371. Here, Wang et al. (2017b)
found that the ﬁeld is highly sheared with respect to the PIL, especially in the pre-

cursor brightening region (panels (a) and (b)). This signiﬁes a high degree of non-
potentiality, as reﬂected by the concentration of magnetic shear along the PIL (panel
(c)). In the region around the initial precursor brightening enclosed by the box in
panel (b), they observed a miniature version of a magnetic channel with a scale of
only 3,000 km, which can also be recognized as the ﬂare-triggering ﬁeld. Impor-
tantly, the evolutions of both polarities within the channel are temporally associated
with the occurrence of precursor episodes (panel (d)).

3.2.2 Flow ﬁelds and spot rotations

Given the high-β condition in the photosphere, it was speculated that such ﬂaring
PILs are generated by the sheared, converging ﬂow ﬁelds around it. In fact, Harvey
and Harvey (1976) observed strong shear ﬂows along the ﬂaring PILs and associated
these ﬂows with the occurrence of ﬂares (Meunier and Kosovichev 2003; Yang et al.

2004; Deng et al. 2006; Shimizu et al. 2014). Also, Keil et al. (1994) showed that the
ﬂare kernels correspond to the locations of convergence in the horizontal ﬂows. The
converging ﬂow and the sustained cancellation of positive and negative polarities on
the two sides of the PIL are thought to be the key process in building up a magnetic
ﬂux rope (van Ballegooijen and Martens 1989, see also Sect. 3.3.1 of this article for
detailed discussion).

The large-scale spot motions drive the ﬂow ﬁelds around the PILs and, because of
the frozen-in state of the ﬁeld, the magnetic structures are reconﬁgured. For instance,
Krall et al. (1982) revealed that the shear ﬂow in the PIL is in association with rapid
spot motions, which enhances the magnetic shear at the PIL and leads to the series of
ﬂares. Wang (1994) observed that magnetic shear development is intrinsically related
to the newly emerging ﬂux.

Strong spot rotations (both the spot rotating around its center and the spot rotating
around its counterpart in the same AR) are also often observed in the pre-ﬂare state.
Figure 21 is a clear example of rotating sunspots in AR NOAA 10930 (Min and Chae

2009). This ﬁgure highlights that the southern spot rotates in the counter-clockwise
direction before the X3.4-class ﬂare occurs. Brown et al. (2003) analyzed rotating
sunspots in seven ARs and found that the spots rotate around their umbral centers
up to 200◦ in 3–5 days. The coronal loops are twisted as the spot rotates, and six
of them showed ﬂares and/or CMEs (R´egnier and Canﬁeld 2006; Zhang et al. 2007,
2008; Vemareddy et al. 2012; Ruan et al. 2014; Vemareddy et al. 2016). Brown et al.
(2003) considered that the spot rotation is caused by the ﬂux tube emergence (see
Sect. 4.1 for the discussion). The observed association of spot rotations and eruptions
is consistent with the theoretical suggestion by Stenﬂo (1969) and Barnes and Stur-
rock (1972) that such spot rotations accumulate ﬂare energy in the atmosphere. Yan
et al. (2008) surveyed 186 rotating sunspots in 153 ARs and statistically investigated
the relationship between the spot rotation and the ﬂare productivity. They found that
ARs with sunspots of rotation direction opposite to the global differential rotation are
in favor of producing M- and X-class ﬂares.

These ﬂow ﬁelds and spot motions strongly suggest the possibility that the ﬂar-
ing ARs, if not all, are produced by the emergence of magnetic ﬂux with a strong
twist. Through these processes, the magnetic ﬂux transports the energy and magnetic
helicity (Sect. 3.2.3) from the subsurface layer to the atmosphere.

Flare-productive active regions

3.2.3 Injection of magnetic helicity

Magnetic helicity is a measure of magnetic structures such as twists, kinks, and in-
ternal linkage (Elsasser 1956) and is a useful tool to quantify and characterize the
complexity of ﬂaring ARs. The magnetic helicity of the magnetic ﬁeld B fully con-
tained in a volume V (i.e., the normal component Bn vanishes at any point of the
surface S) is deﬁned as

A · B dV,

H =

ZV

(4)

where A is the vector potential of B, i.e., B = ∇ × A. H is invariant to gauge trans-
formations and, in ideal MHD, H is a conserved quantity. Even under resistive MHD
where magnetic reconnection can occur, it is shown that dissipation of H is much
slower than dissipation of magnetic energy (Berger 1984). However, in many prac-
tical situations, the ﬁeld lines cross the surface of the volume of interest S (e.g., the
photosphere) and thus it is convenient to use the relative magnetic helicity (Berger
and Field 1984; Finn and Antonsen Jr 1985):

HR =

ZV

(A + A0) · (B − B0) dV,

(5)

where A0 and B0 are the reference vector potential and magnetic ﬁeld, respectively
(B0 has the same Bn distribution on S). HR is also a gauge-invariant quantity, and
often the potential ﬁeld Bp (= ∇ × Ap) is chosen as the reference ﬁeld:

HR =

ZV

(A + Ap) · (B − Bp) dV.

(6)

One way to calculate the relative helicity in the coronal volume is to rely on 3D
magnetic extrapolations as it is not yet possible to fully measure the magnetic ﬁelds in
the atmosphere (Sect. 4.3.1). Alternatively, it is also possible to monitor the helicity
ﬂux (helicity injection rate) through the photosphere over the AR, 5

where v is the velocity of the plasma and vn is the component normal to the surface.
This parameter has been used more commonly to investigate the accumulation of
helicity during the course of AR evolution (Chae 2001; Chae et al. 2001; Green et al.
2002; Nindos et al. 2003; Chae et al. 2004). Note that in the last equation, the ﬁrst
and second terms in the bracket are called the “emergence term” and “shear term,”
respectively.

Many observational studies have shown the temporal relationship between the
helicity injection and the occurrence of ﬂares and CMEs (Moon et al. 2002a,b; Chae
et al. 2004; Magara and Tsuneta 2008; Park et al. 2008, 2012). For instance, Moon
et al. (2002a,b) revealed that the signiﬁcant amount of helicity was impulsively in-
jected around the peak time of X-ray ﬂux of the ﬂare events they studied, especially

for the strong ones (Fig. 22(a)). The authors attributed the observed impulsive helic-
ity injection to the horizontal velocity anomalies near the PIL. However, because the
location of helicity injection is near the ﬂaring site (e.g., Hα ﬂare ribbons), the possi-
bility can not be ruled out that the observation is affected by an artifact of the magne-
togram (SOHO/MDI) due to emission caused by particle precipitation that changes
the spectral line’s shape.

From long-term monitoring, Park et al. (2008, 2012) found that the helicity ﬁrst
increases monotonically and then remains almost constant just before the ﬂares. Some

events show the sign of injected helicity reverses and, in such cases, the ﬂares are
more energetic and impulsive and the accompanying CMEs are faster and more re-
curring. Park et al. (2010a) and Jing et al. (2012) compared the accumulated helicity
injection measured by integrating Eq. (7) over time and the coronal helicity derived
from the NLFFF extrapolation (Sect. 4.3.1) and found close correlations between the
two parameters (see Fig. 22(b)).

From the viewpoint of helicity budget, the CME works as a carrier of helicity that
is taken away from a ﬂaring AR and leads the magnetic system of the AR to lower en-
ergy states (see illustration in Fig. 7(b): Rust 1994; D´emoulin et al. 2002; Green et al.
2002). However, accumulated helicity may also be reduced by annihilation of two
magnetic systems of opposite helicity sign (through magnetic reconnection). Several
observations show that magnetic systems with oppositely singed helicity commonly
exist in a given AR and the interaction of these systems play a key role in driving
ﬂares and CMEs (Kusano et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2004c; Chandra et al. 2010; Ro-
mano et al. 2011; Zuccarello et al. 2011). This scenario is further supported by MHD
simulations by Kusano et al. (2004, 2012), in which the emergence of reversed shear
near the PIL triggers the eruption.

Statistical investigations on a number of ARs clearly demonstrate the tendency
that ﬂare-productive ARs have a signiﬁcantly higher amount of helicity than ﬂare-
quiet ARs (Nindos and Andrews 2004; Park et al. 2010b). LaBonte et al. (2007)
compared 48 X-ﬂare-producing ARs and 345 non-X-ﬂaring regions and derived an
empirical threshold for the occurrence of an X-class ﬂare that the peak helicity ﬂux
exceeds a magnitude of 6 × 1036 Mx2 s−1 (see Fig. 23). Tziotziou et al. (2012, 2014)
found a consistent monotonic scaling between the relative helicity and the free mag-
netic energy for both observational data sets and MHD simulations (Moraitis et al.

36

Shin Toriumi, Haimin Wang

2014). However, it should be noted that these results do not take into account the area
of ARs. Because the magnetic helicity in a ﬂux system scales as the square of that
system’s magnetic ﬂux, we can compare, by normalizing the magnetic helicity by the
ﬂux squared, how much the magnetic conﬁguration is stressed in ARs of the same
size (D´emoulin and Pariat 2009).

As mentioned above, ﬂaring ARs exhibit a fairly complicated distribution of
both positive and negative signs of magnetic helicity. The helicity ﬂux distribution
can be measured by computing and mapping the density of helicity ﬂux in Eq. (7):
GA = 2[(Ap · B)vn − (Ap · v)Bn], or simply GA = −2(Ap · v)Bn. However, Pariat et al.
(2005) showed that GA is not a proper helicity ﬂux density as GA can be non zero (GA
map can show variation) even with simple translational motions that do not inject
any magnetic helicity. Then, they proposed an alternative proxy of the helicity ﬂux
density, GΦ, which takes into account the magnetic ﬁeld connectivity and thus re-
quires 3D magnetic extrapolations. Dalmasse et al. (2013, 2014) developed a method
to compute GΦ and applied it to observational data of the complex ﬂaring AR NOAA
11158 (Fig. 14), showing that this proxy reliably and accurately maps the distribution
of photospheric helicity injection.

3.2.4 Magnetic tongues and importance of structural complexity

In vertical (or LOS) magnetograms, the newly emerging regions, especially of AR
scales, display “magnetic tongue” structures, the extended magnetic polarities at both
sides of the PIL (Fig. 24(a)), ﬁrst mentioned by L´opez Fuentes et al. (2000). The
magnetic tongues that resemble the yin-yang pattern are thought to be the vertical
projection of the poloidal component of the twisted emerging magnetic ﬂux tube
(Fig. 24(b)), and thus, the layout of tongues and the direction of PILs are used as
proxies of magnetic helicity sign of emerging ﬁelds (Sect. 3.2.3: Luoni et al. 2011;
Takizawa and Kitai 2015; Poisson et al. 2015, 2016). Multiple observational studies
showed that such yin-yang tongues are seen in ﬂaring ARs, along with other ob-
servational characteristics including sigmoids, sheared coronal loops, and J-shaped
ﬂare ribbons (Li et al. 2007; Green et al. 2007; Canou et al. 2009; Chandra et al.
2009; Mandrini et al. 2014). This may indicate that the ﬂaring ARs tend to possess
substantial magnetic helicity.

One of the important conclusions from the series of statistical investigations in
Sect. 2.3 was that magnetic ﬁelds of ﬂare-productive ARs exhibit higher degrees of
complexity. While classical sunspot categorizations (e.g., McIntosh and Mount Wil-
son schemes) simply provide qualitative indices of the ARs’ complexity, one well-
studied quantitative measure of the complexity is the fractal dimension, an indication
of self-similarity of structures (Mandelbrot 1983). From the fractal dimension anal-
ysis using full-disk magnetograms over 7.5 years, McAteer et al. (2005) found that
the ﬂare productivity, in terms of both GOES magnitude and frequency, has a good
correlation with fractal dimension. They showed a threshold fractal dimension of 1.2
and 1.25 as a necessary requirement for an AR to produce M- and X-class ﬂares,
respectively, within next 24 hour period. Interestingly, McAteer et al. (2005) also
found that the frequency distributions of the fractal dimension for different Mount
Wilson classes (α, β, βγ, βγδ) are similar to each other with a mean fractal dimen-

sion of 1.32. Perhaps this result indicates that, for the production of strong ﬂares, the
complexity of mid-to-small scales (smaller than the whole AR: detected by the frac-
tal dimension analysis) has to exist along with the large-scale complexity (AR size:
characterized by the Mount Wilson class).

Importance of small-scale ﬁelds in the ﬂare production is also demonstrated by
plotting the power spectra of magnetograms. Abramenko (2005) calculated the power-
law index α of the magnetic power spectrum E(k) ∼ k−α of the magnetograms for
16 ARs, where k being the spatial wavenumber, and compared α with the ﬂare index
FI, which represents the ﬂare productivity of a given AR:

and l designate ﬂares in each class. As shown in Fig. 25, it was revealed that higher
ﬂare productivity is associated with steeper spectrum: the power-law index is α > 2.0
for ARs producing X-class ﬂares and is α ≈ 5/3 for ﬂare-quiet ARs (i.e., regime
of classical Kolmogorov turbulence; Kolmogorov 1941). Although not mentioned
in Abramenko (2005), the above result might also be explained by the observation
that larger ARs tend to produce stronger ﬂares (e.g., Sammis et al. 2000): the spatial
power spectrum of a large AR would have more power at low wavenumbers but have
the same power at higher wavenumbers, which leads to a steeper power spectrum for
a larger AR.

The works introduced in this subsubsection essentially show the fractal, multi-
fractal, and/or turbulent nature of ﬂaring ARs (Abramenko et al. 2002, 2003; Abra-
menko and Yurchyshyn 2010; McAteer et al. 2010; Georgoulis 2012). Regarding
the practical ﬂare prediction, Georgoulis (2005) revealed, however, that the fractal
dimension does not have signiﬁcant predictability. Rather, they suggested that the
temporal evolution of the fractal diagnostics may be practically useful in ﬂare predic-
tion.

3.2.5 (Im)balance of electric currents

Magnetic energy that is released in solar ﬂares stems from the non-potential, magnetic
ﬁeld associated with electrical currents. An important and long-standing question
about the electric current is whether or not the current is neutralized in ARs, and, if
not, to what extent and how (e.g., Melrose 1991, 1995, 1996; Parker 1996).

Flare-productive active regions

39

For the violation of current neutralization, two basic mechanisms have been pro-
posed, which are (1) the magnetic ﬁeld lines are stressed and twisted by photospheric
and sub-photospheric ﬂow motions (e.g., Klimchuk and Sturrock 1992; T¨or¨ok and
Kliem 2003; Dalmasse et al. 2015); and (2) the current is provided by the emergence
of twisted, i.e., current-carrying ﬂux tubes (e.g., Leka et al. 1996; Longcope and
Welsch 2000; Fan 2001b).

The current neutralization is investigated by examining whether the total electric
current integrated over a single magnetic polarity of an AR vanishes. This is equiva-
lent to whether the main (direct) current of a ﬂux tube is surrounded by the shielding
(return) current of equal strength and opposite direction. A number of observers have
tried to address this issue by measuring the longitudinal (vertical) component of elec-
tric current density from the vector magnetogram,

where c is the speed of light. Whereas Wilkinson et al. (1992) stated that their data
do not convincingly show a non-neutralized current system, many observations have
consistently suggested the existence of twisted ﬂux systems, in favor of the scenario
(2) (see a variety of observations introduced in previous sections). To cite a case,
Wheatland (2000) examined vector magnetograms for 21 ARs and found that the
electric currents in the positive and negative polarities signiﬁcantly deviated from
zero in more than half of the ARs studied, indicating that the AR currents are typ-
ically not neutralized. Using vector magnetograms of the highest quality by Hin-
ode/SOT/SP, Georgoulis et al. (2012) investigated the distribution of currents in a
ﬂaring/eruptive AR (NOAA 10930) and a ﬂare-quiet one (NOAA 10940). They found
that substantial non-neutralized currents are injected along the photospheric PILs and
that more intense PILs yield stronger non-neutralized currents. From statistical stud-
ies, Liu et al. (2017b) and Kontogiannis et al. (2017) showed that the ﬂare- and CME-
producing ARs are characterized by strong non-neutralized currents.

However, because the measurement of electric currents is strongly hampered by
the limited resolution and ambiguities of magnetogram, it has always been a challeng-
ing task to accurately evaluate the distribution of currents as in Eq. (9). Therefore, to
ﬁgure out whether the ARs are born with net currents, it is desirable to enlist the aid
of numerical modeling (T¨or¨ok et al. 2014, see Sect. 4.1).

3.3 Atmospheric and subsurface evolutions

3.3.1 Formation of ﬂux ropes: sigmoids and ﬁlaments

In ﬂare-productive ARs, free magnetic energy is stored in non-potential coronal ﬁelds
that harbor signiﬁcant amount of shear and twist. When observed in soft X-rays,
these coronal ﬁelds display forward or inverse S-shaped structures, which was ﬁrst
observed by Acton et al. (1992) and are called “sigmoids” (Rust and Kumar 1996):
see review by Gibson et al. (2006). Figure 26(top) shows a typical example of a
sigmoid. One may ﬁnd that its structure is in good agreement with the extrapolated

become sheared and converged due to the photospheric motions (panels a to c). Magnetic reconnection then

coronal ﬁelds, which shows the form of a magnetic ﬂux rope. From the statistical
analysis of the data from Yohkoh’s Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT; Tsuneta et al. 1991),
Canﬁeld et al. (1999) revealed that ARs are signiﬁcantly more likely to be eruptive
if they are either sigmoid or large: 51% of all ARs analyzed are sigmoid and they
account for 65% of the observed eruptions. This result attracted interest in sigmoids
as precursors of ﬂare eruptions, and the trend was conﬁrmed later by Canﬁeld et al.
(2007), Savcheva et al. (2014), and Kawabata et al. (2018).

Sigmoids are often accompanied by Hα ﬁlaments (e.g., Pevtsov et al. 1996;
Pevtsov 2002), and they form above and along the PILs in the evolving ARs. It is
therefore important to understand the formation mechanism of sigmoids in relation
to the large-scale/long-term evolution of the photospheric ﬁelds (as we saw earlier in

Flare-productive active regions

41

Sects. 3.1 and 3.2). In fact, the series of sigmoid observations indicate that they are
created in the manner anticipated in the ﬁlament formation model by van Ballegooi-
jen and Martens (1989) (see Fig. 26(bottom)), in which the shearing and converging
ﬂow around the PIL drives ﬂux cancellation and twists up the arcade ﬁelds to create
a ﬂux rope (see also Martens and Zwaan 2001).6

Figure 27 is one of the most compelling examples of the sigmoid formation
through spot evolution (Green et al. 2011). At the central PIL of this AR, about one
third of the magnetic ﬂux cancels in 2.5 days before the ﬂare eruption and the photo-
spheric ﬁeld shows an apparent shearing motion (top panels). At the same time, the
coronal structure transforms ﬁrst from a weakly to a highly sheared arcade then to a
sigmoid that lies over the PIL (bottom panels). The sigmoid ﬂux rope erupts even-
tually during the GOES B1.4-class ﬂare, leaving an arcade structure in soft X-ray
images (Sterling and Hudson 1997; Hudson et al. 1998; Sterling et al. 2000). A sim-
ilar long-term transition of coronal ﬁelds from a sheared arcade or a pair of J-shaped
loops to the sigmoid was also observed by Tripathi et al. (2009), Green and Kliem
(2009), and Savcheva et al. (2012b). From these observations, one can infer that the
twisted ﬂux rope in a ﬂaring AR is formed above the PIL due to the photospheric
driving before the eruption.

Then, it is natural to speculate that magnetic helicity is the cause of the ﬂux rope
structure. To this end, Yamamoto et al. (2005) analyzed three sigmoid ARs and found
that in two regions, the magnetic helicity injected through the sigmoid footpoints is
comparable to the helicity content of the sigmoid loops. However, this is not true for
the other AR, which may be because the sigmoid consists of multiple loops. They
concluded that, excluding the latter complex AR, the magnetic twist of sigmoids is
consistent with the helicity injected from the sigmoid footpoints. Investigating var-
ious ﬁlament eruption events associated with sigmoids, Green et al. (2007) showed
that the structure of a sigmoid agrees with the helicity of a ﬁlament (e.g., forward
S-shaped sigmoid for positive helicity ﬁlament) and that the rotation of a ﬁlament
apex during the eruption is consistent with the helicity of the ﬁlament (e.g., clock-
wise rotation for positive helicity ﬁlament). The authors found that these behaviors
agree with the kink instability scenario as numerically modeled by T¨or¨ok and Kliem
(2005).

Thermal structures of sigmoid ARs have been investigated by differential emis-
sion measure (DEM) analysis (for detailed account of this method, see Sects. 7
and 8 of Del Zanna and Mason 2018). For instance, the DEM maps of AR NOAA
11158 in Fig. 28, calculated from six EUV images of SDO/AIA by Cheung et al.
(2015), clearly reveals that a hot core structure is embedded in the center of AR
(log (T [K]) > 6.6) and covered by cooler overlying loops (log (T [K]) . 6.3). Syntelis
et al. (2016) analyzed the pre-eruptive phase of NOAA 11429, which is responsible
for the two consecutive X-class ﬂares with fast CMEs, using data from both AIA and
Hinode’s EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS; Culhane et al. 2007). They found that the
mean DEM of the ﬂux ropes in the temperature range of log (T [K]) = 6.8–7.1 grad-
ually increased by an order of magnitude about ﬁve hours before the CME eruption.

6 It is also suggested that the ﬂux ropes emerge bodily from below the surface (e.g., Lites et al. 1995;

Okamoto et al. 2008).

This increase was associated with the rising of the ﬂux rope and may be related to
the observed heating in CME cores (Cheng et al. 2012; Hannah and Kontar 2013),
although the physical relationship with instabilities is not clear.

wavelength of the emission line, c the speed of light, vt the thermal velocity, and vnt
the non-thermal velocity.

Alexander et al. (1998), Ranns et al. (2000), and Harra et al. (2001) showed that
the non-thermal broadening peaks in the early phase of, or even tens of minutes, be-
fore the ﬂare occurrence, and suggested that the broadening indicates turbulence that
is related to the ﬂare triggering mechanism. However, Harra et al. (2009) revealed
that the pre-ﬂare broadening starts much earlier. They measured the non-thermal ve-
locity of Fe XII 195 ˚A line using Hinode/EIS and found that, as shown in Fig. 29,
the increase in the line width begins up to one day before the X-class ﬂare occurs
after the helicity injection saturates (Magara and Tsuneta 2008). Imada et al. (2014)
revisited this event and showed that this pre-ﬂare broadening occurs in concurrence
with upﬂow of about 10 to 30 km s−1. They speculated that the upﬂow indicates the
expansion of outer coronal loops and this rising motion (observed as the Doppler
blueshift) causes the excess broadening.

3.3.3 Helioseismic signatures in the interior

Given the complex features of magnetic ﬁelds in ﬂaring ARs, it is natural to ask if
there is any subsurface counterpart. One of the earliest attempts to apply the local he-
lioseismology techniques to search for the statistical relation between the subsurface
ﬂow ﬁeld and the ﬂare occurrence was done by Mason et al. (2006): Fig. 30 (top).
They applied the ring-diagram method to 408 ARs from the Global Oscillation Net-
work Group (GONG) data and 159 ARs from the SOHO/MDI data to measure the
vorticity of ﬂows (ω = ∇ × v) and compared it with the total ﬂare intensity (equiva-
lent to the ﬂare index FI: Eq. (8)). It was found that the maximum unsigned vorticity
components at a depth of about 12 Mm, calculated from a synoptic maps of global
subsurface ﬂows that are generated by averaging the ring-diagram ﬂow ﬁelds over
7 days (Haber et al. 2002), are correlated well with the ﬂare intensity greater than
3.2 × 10−5 W m−2. For ﬂare activity below this value, the relation was not appar-
ent. Komm and Hill (2009) expanded the analysis to 1009 ARs including non-ﬂaring
ones. As shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 30, they demonstrated a clear relation be-
tween the magnetic ﬂux density (total magnetic ﬂux averaged over area: in the unit of
G) and vorticity for ﬂaring ARs (correlation coefﬁcient CC = 0.75). The non-ﬂaring
ARs show a similar trend but the correlation is weaker (CC = 0.5) and the mean
values of ﬂux and vorticity are smaller. The authors concluded that the inclusion of
vorticity helps to distinguish between ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring regions.

Reinard et al. (2010) put more focus on the temporal evolution of subsurface ﬂow
ﬁelds. By analyzing 1023 ARs with the ring-diagram method, they showed that (1) at
ﬁrst, about 2–3 days before the ﬂare occurrence, the kinetic helicity density, v · ω =
v · (∇ × v), has a large spread in values with depth, but the spread decreases on the
days of the ﬂares, and that (2) the degree of shrinking is greater for stronger ﬂares. The
observed tendency lends support to the interpretation that the subsurface rotational
turbulent ﬂows twist the magnetic ﬁelds into unstable conﬁgurations and drives the
ﬂare eruptions. Komm et al. (2011a) further applied discriminant analysis to various
magnetic and subsurface ﬂow parameters and found that the subsurface parameters
improve the ability to distinguish between the ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring ARs. The most
important parameter is the structure vorticity, which estimates the horizontal gradient
of the horizontal vorticity components.

As an independent ring-diagram study, Lin (2014) compared the ﬂare activity lev-
els of 77 ARs and the quantities that describe the subsurface structural disturbances.
According to the author, there was no remarkable correlation between these parame-
ters.

Another approach is to apply time-distance helioseismology. Using the sequential
SDO/HMI data of ﬁve ﬂare-productive ARs, Gao et al. (2012, 2014) compared the
kinetic helicity density measured from the subsurface velocity maps and the current
helicity density calculated from the photospheric vector magnetograms, B · (∇ × B),7
and found a good correlation between the two values. They found that eight out of a
total of 11 events show a drastic amplitude change of the kinetic helicity density, and
ﬁve of them are accompanied by ﬂares stronger than M5.0 level within eight hours,

7 Not to be confused with the magnetic helicity density, B · A = A · (∇ × A): see Sect. 3.2.3.

either before or after the amplitude change. The spread of the kinetic helicity density
in depth also showed strong variations, which conﬁrms the observational result of
Reinard et al. (2010).

Braun (2016) used helioseismic holography to more than 250 ARs observed be-
tween 2010 and 2014. They found that individual ARs show mostly variations asso-
ciated with non-ﬂare related evolution, although correlations between the ﬂare soft
X-ray ﬂux and subsurface ﬂow indices are in general similar to those found previ-
ously by Komm and Hill (2009). Moreover, they detected no remarkable precursors
or other temporal changes that are speciﬁcally associated with the ﬂare occurrences.
It should be pointed out that whereas not a small number of results have been re-
ported, there is no clear physical model that explains the statistical correlations found
between ﬂaring and various properties of subsurface ﬂows. For instance, it is not clear
why the subsurface vorticity is correlated with AR ﬂux, better for the ﬂaring ARs than
for the non-ﬂaring ARs (Fig. 30). Therefore, further investigation, probably with the
aid of numerical simulations, is required to interpret the observational results.

The difﬁculty resides also in the observational techniques. In many cases, the ex-
istence of strong magnetic ﬂux (i.e. ARs) is assumed as a small perturbation when
solving the linear inverse problem in seismology. However, this may not be true (see
Gizon and Birch 2005, Sect. 3.7). Development of seismology techniques, again with
the assistance of modeling, may overcome this shortcoming and deepen our under-
standing of subsurface evolutions.

3.4 Summary of this section

In this section, we have reviewed the important observational characteristics that are
created in the long-term and large-scale evolution of ﬂare-productive ARs. Many of
these characteristics manifest the morphological and magnetic complexity of such
ARs and prove the inherent high non-potentiality of the magnetic system.

The δ-spots, in which the umbrae of both polarities share a common penum-
bra (Sect. 2.3), are formed in three ways (Sect. 3.1): Type 1 (Spot-spot), the tightly
packed sunspot with multiple bipoles intertwined; Type 2 (Spot-satellite), where a
newly emerging ﬂux appears in close proximity to a pre-existing spot; and Type 3
(Quadrupole), the head-on collision of two neighboring bipoles. However, X-class
ﬂares also emanate from between two separated ARs, albeit rarely (Inter-AR). The
δ-spots develop the strong-ﬁeld, strong-gradient, highly-sheared PILs, which some-
times show a magnetic channel, a narrow lane structure consisting of elongated ﬂux
threads of opposite polarities (Sect. 3.2.1). These magnetic evolutions are caused by
the shearing and converging ﬂows around the PIL, where as remarkable sunspot ro-
tations, both the self and mutual rotations, are also observed (Sect. 3.2.2).

Injection of magnetic helicity is found to have temporal correlation with ﬂare
productivity, while X-class ﬂares require a signiﬁcantly higher amount of helicity
injection (Sect. 3.2.3). The magnetic tongue structure is thought to be the manifesta-
tion of emergence of twisted magnetic ﬂux and is used as a proxy of magnetic helicity
sign (Sect. 3.2.4). In studies addressing the old question of whether AR currents are
neutralized or not, the preponderance of recent evidence supports the view that elec-

48

Shin Toriumi, Haimin Wang

tric currents are not neutralized, particularly in regions prone to exhibit large ﬂares
(Sect. 3.2.5).

Twisted ﬂux ropes, observed as Hα ﬁlaments and soft X-ray sigmoids, can be
produced in the atmosphere above the PILs due to the shearing and converging ﬂows
and helicity injection, which eventually erupt in the ﬂares and evolves into CMEs
(Sect. 3.3.1).

Though more extensive surveys are desired, several works have shown that ﬂar-
ing ARs have more smaller-scale features, probably reﬂecting the morphological and
magnetic complexity (Sect. 3.2.4), coronal upﬂows with excess broadening of EUV
emission lines in response to the helicity injection (Sect.3.3.2), and properties of vor-
ticity in the convection zone (Sect. 3.3.3).

AR NOAA 12673, which appeared in September 2017 and produced numerous
ﬂares including the X9.3-class event, is characteristic of the important features intro-
duced in this section. Figure 31 by Yang et al. (2017a) shows the overall evolution
and the formation of the ﬂaring PIL. This AR rotates on to the visible disk as a simple
α-spot of positive polarity. On September 3, two bipolar systems A and B suddenly
emerge to the east of the pre-existing central spot (panels a1–a3), and two additional
bipoles C and D emerge more in the north-south direction within the ﬁrst two pairs,
forming a highly complex δ-spot (panels b1–b3). This evolution reminds us of a
Type-2 δ-spot, but at the same time the collision of the secondary bipoles C and D is
also reminiscent of the Type-3 structure. Sun and Norton (2017) pointed out that the
emergence rate of this AR is one of the fastest emergence events ever observed.

As the negative polarity of D rapidly intrudes into the positive polarities, it pro-
duces a strong-ﬁeld, strong-gradient, highly-sheared PIL (Fig. 31: location where free
energy is enhanced in panel c1). According to Yang et al. (2017a), because the pre-
existing central spot blocks the free development of the newly-emerging ﬁelds, the
Bz gradient at the PIL becomes much enhanced. As Fig. 32 illustrates, Wang et al.
(2018a) detected exceptionally strong transverse ﬁelds of up to 5570 G around this
PIL. In the corona above this PIL, a ﬂux rope structure is clearly reproduced by the
NLFFF modeling (Fig. 31: red ﬁeld lines in panel b2), which agrees well with the sig-
moidal structure. Moreover, Verma (2018), Yan et al. (2018), and Vemareddy (2019)
reported on the PIL shear ﬂows, spot rotations, and helicity injection, respectively,
which combined seems to activate the X9.3 ﬂare.

4 Long-term and large-scale evolution: theoretical aspects

As we saw in the preceding sections, in its long history of solar observation, a vast
amount of key observational features that differentiate the ﬂare-productive ARs from
the quiescent ones have been discovered. The essential questions we have are, of
course, how are they created and what is the underlying physics? The other side of
solar physics, the theoretical and numerical studies, may provide answers to these
questions.

Because there have already been substantial number of simulation models to date,
in order to offer the reader a guideline, we introduce three genres of modeling, follow-
ing the discussion in Cheung and Isobe (2014). The ﬁrst group is the data-inspired

models, which assume an ideal simulation setup that is “inspired” by the observa-
tions. Flux emergence and ﬂux cancellation models fall into this group. The sec-
ond group is the data-constrained models, in which the models use observational
data at a single moment to drive computations. The series of extrapolated magnetic
ﬁelds, computed from the sequential photospheric magnetogram, is one represen-
tative model of this group. However, it is less likely that such static solutions are

applicable to ﬂare-producing, i.e., dynamically evolving ARs. So, another way of the
data-constrained models is to use the extrapolated ﬁeld as the initial condition and
solve the time-dependent MHD equations to trace the temporal evolution. The third
group, the data-driven models, even utilizes a temporal sequence of observational
data, such as the series of magnetograms, to drive the models.

The ﬂux emergence and ﬂux cancellation models are introduced in Sects. 4.1 and
4.2, respectively. The data-constrained and data-driven models, which are still rather
the newcomers, are jointly shown in Sect. 4.3.

4.1 Flux emergence models

The fundamental premise of the formation and evolution of ﬂaring ARs is that solar
ARs are produced ultimately by emerging ﬂux from the convection zone. Therefore,
it is not surprising that many theoretical models have focused on the evolution process
of ﬂaring ARs from below the surface of the Sun, which we call the ﬂux emergence
models. These models leverage the 3D ﬂux emergence simulations, such as those in
Sect. 2.1.4, and try to capture some aspects of observed magnetic features of ﬂaring
ARs. In fact, even classical models that conﬁgure a simple Ω-loop can explain some
of the observed features.

Magnetic tongues: As the series of observational studies predicted, magnetic tongues,
the extended magnetic patches on the both sides of the PIL, are well reproduced
by the emergence of a twisted ﬂux tube (see, e.g., Fig. 4(e)). Archontis and Hood
(2010) compared the magnetogram of AR NOAA 10808 and that produced in
their numerical simulation and showed that the pattern of magnetic tongues de-
pends on the azimuthal ﬁeld of the emerging ﬂux tube.

Flux ropes and sigmoids: It was Manchester et al. (2004) who ﬁrst reproduced the
ﬂux rope structures self-consistently in the 3D ﬂux emergence simulation. In
their model, where the buoyant segment of the ﬂux tube is shorter than that of
Fan (2001b)’s model, the upper part of the emerged ﬂux tube becomes detached
from the main body and forms a coronal ﬂux rope that erupts into the higher at-
mosphere as in a CME. Archontis and T¨or¨ok (2008) explained the formation of
a ﬂux rope as magnetic reconnection between a set of emerging loops. Because
the original ﬂux tube is twisted, the emerged loops are sheared above the PIL and
reconnect with each other, forming a ﬂux rope structure. Archontis et al. (2009)
revealed that the electric current sheets, which originally have a pair of J-shaped
conﬁgurations, are joined to form a sigmoid structure as observed in soft X-rays.
Similar sigmoid structure was observed in the models by, e.g., Magara (2006),
Fan (2009b), and Archontis and Hood (2012).

Shear ﬂows: The essential driver of the shear ﬂows in the emergence simulations is
the Lorentz force on the two sides of the PIL in opposite directions (Manchester
2001). When the twisted ﬂux tube emerges into the atmosphere, the rapid expan-
sion deforms the ﬁeld lines of the ﬂux tube and drives the shear ﬂows around the
PIL. Fan (2001b) and Manchester et al. (2004) explained the twisting up of the
coronal ﬁeld as a shear Alfv´en wave propagating upward, while Fan (2009b) in-
terpreted it as a torsional Alfv´en wave. The horizontal velocity vector of Fig. 4(e)
clearly displays the shear ﬂows around the PIL.

Helicity injection: Injection of magnetic helicity ﬂux through the photosphere was
investigated by Magara and Longcope (2003), who revealed that in the earliest
stage, the emergence term dominates, which then reduces and the shear term be-
comes the main source of the helicity injection for the rest of the period (see
Sect. 3.2.3 for the deﬁnition of the terms). The helicity transport by the shear term
is explained by the horizontal shearing and rotational motions at the footpoints of
the emerged magnetic ﬁelds (Longcope and Welsch 2000; Fan 2009b).

Spot rotation: This can be considered as the subtopic of the helicity injection. Long-
cope and Welsch (2000) proposed a theoretical model that treats both the ex-
panded twisted ﬂux tube in the corona and that remaining in the convection zone.
In this model, as a twisted tube emerges, the torsional Alfv´en wave propagates
downward into the convection zone due to the mismatch of twists between the
two layers and causes the spot rotation. Magara and Longcope (2003) and Ma-
gara (2006) found that the rotational ﬂows are formed in each of the spots soon
after the rising ﬂux tube becomes vertical, whereas Fan (2009b) shows that sig-
niﬁcant vortical motions develop as a torsional Alfv´en wave propagates along the
ﬂux tube. Sturrock et al. (2015) used a toroidal tube model (Hood et al. 2009)
and revealed that two sunspots do undergo rotation (not an apparent effect). They
explained the rotation by unbalanced torque produced by magnetic tension.

(top) is loosened, the original twist
converts into the writhe of the coiled
ribbon (bottom). In an analogous way,
a twisted ﬂux tube deforms into a
curled shape if the twist is sufﬁciently
strong, which is the helical kink insta-
bility.

(Im)balance of electric currents: T¨or¨ok et al. (2014) considered the emergence of a
ﬂux tube that contains neutralized electric currents (i.e., the situation where the
direct current along the axis is balanced with the return current at the tube’s pe-
riphery). As the signiﬁcant emergence to the surface begins, the current rapidly
deviates from the neutralized state and the total direct current remains several
times larger than that of the return current throughout the whole evolution. They
suggested that when the tube approaches the surface, the return current is pushed
aside by the direct current. Also, most of the return currents remain beneath the
surface because the tube does not undergo a bodily emergence. It was therefore
concluded that ARs are born on the surface with substantial net electric currents.

The above features are formed as parts of relaxation processes in which the twist
of the ﬂux tube is released through the emergence from the convection zone to the
corona. However, in most of the these numerical models that assume a simple buoy-
ant emergence of ﬂux tubes, other important characteristics of ﬂaring ARs, such as
tightly-packed δ-spots with strong-ﬁeld, strong-gradient, highly-sheared PILs, are
not reproduced. The two photospheric footpoints of the emerging Ω-loops are prone
to separation in a monotonous fashion and never form a converged, δ-shaped struc-
ture. Therefore, to overcome this difﬁculty, one needs to assume subsurface magnetic
ﬁelds with not-so-simple conﬁgurations.

4.1.1 Kinked tube model

The idea of the emergence of a kink-unstable magnetic ﬂux tube is inspired by the
observations of ﬂare-productive ARs, especially of Type 1 δ-spots (see Sect. 3.1).
These regions have compact morphology and strong twists, and the tilt often deviates
so much from parallel to the equator that sometimes it even violates Hale’s polarity
rule. The 3D conﬁgurations inferred from the proper motion of the spots strongly
suggest the emergence of “a knotted twisted ﬂux tube” (Tanaka 1991, see Fig. 15(a)
of this article).

According to Kurokawa (1991), it was Piddington (1974) who ﬁrst proposed the
concept of emerging twisted ﬂux tubes for the energy source in the Alfv´en wave

Flare-productive active regions

53

theory of solar ﬂares. In Appendix A, we show the history about who suggested the
kink instability ﬁrst as the formation mechanism of the δ-spots.

The helical kink instability is the instability of a highly-twisted ﬂux tube, in which
the twist of the tube (turning of the ﬁeld lines around the tube’s axis) is converted
to writhe (turning of the axis itself) due to the helicity conservation (see Fig. 33:
Berger and Field 1984; Moffatt and Ricca 1992). It was applied to laboratory plasma
(e.g., Shafranov 1957; Kruskal et al. 1958) and to coronal plasma (e.g., Gold and
Hoyle 1960; Anzer 1968; Raadu 1972; Hood and Priest 1980, 1981), before Linton
et al. (1996) considered the kink instability of ﬂux tubes in a high-β plasma.8 For a
uniformly twisted cylindrical ﬂux tube with the axial and azimuthal ﬁelds of Bx(r)
and Bφ(r) = qrBx(r), respectively, where r is the radial distance from the tube’s axis
and the twist q is constant, the ﬂux tube becomes unstable against the kink instability
when q exceeds a critical value

qcr = a−1,

(11)

where a−2 is the coefﬁcient for the r2 term in the Taylor series expansion of the axial
ﬁeld Bx about the ﬂux tube: Bx(r) = Btube(1 − a−2r2 + . . .). In the case of commonly
used Gaussian ﬂux tubes, in which

with Rtube being the typical radius of the tube, the critical twist is simply expressed

tube. Linton et al. (1996) also argued that, as the ﬂux tube rises through the
convection zone, the originally stable tube may become unstable because the tube
expands (Rtube increases) due to the decreasing surrounding pressure, which lowers
the critical twist (qcr decreases).

The ﬁrst 3D non-linear simulation of the kink-unstable emergence was done by
Matsumoto et al. (1998) for reproducing the sequence of sigmoid ARs (top left panel
of Fig. 26). Linton et al. (1998, 1999) performed linear and nonlinear calculations
of the kink instability in a uniform medium without taking into account the effects
of gravity and stratiﬁcation of external plasma. Using the 3D anelastic MHD code,
Fan et al. (1998b, 1999) calculated the emergence in an adiabatically stratiﬁed atmo-
sphere representing the solar convection zone (Fig. 34) and found that, due to the kink
instability, the writhing of the tube increases the buoyancy at the apex and accelerates
the emergence. The horizontal cross-section of the tube shows a compact bipolar pair
of Bz with a highly sheared horizontal ﬁeld along the PIL, and the line connecting
the two polarities is deﬂected by more than 90◦ from its original orientation. These
structures are highly reminiscent of the δ-spots.

8 Note that the kink instability is also suggested as one driving mechanism of CME eruption: see

Sect. 2.2.

However, because these emergence simulations were conﬁned to the convection
zone, it remained unclear if the kinked tubes can really produce observed character-
istics when they emerge into the atmosphere. To overcome this issue, Takasao et al.
(2015) performed a fully compressible MHD simulation in which a subsurface kink-
unstable ﬂux tube rises from the convection zone seamlessly into the solar corona. In
their model, the rising ﬂux tube develops a knotted structure as in the previous sim-
ulations (e.g., Fan et al. 1998b; Linton et al. 1999) and, at the top-most convection
zone, it undergoes a strong horizontal expansion due to the strong stratiﬁcation and
deforms into a pancake-like shape (two-step emergence, a commonly observed fea-
ture of large-scale ﬂux emergence models: see Sect. 2.1.1 and Fig. 2). Interestingly, as
opposed to the simple bipolar structure observed in the kinked tube simulations lim-
ited to the convection zone (right panel of Fig. 34), the photospheric magnetogram
in Fig. 35 shows a quadrupolar structure consisting of the main bipolar pair of large
roundish spots that appears in the earlier phase and the narrow, elongated middle pair
formed later. The middle pair is created due to the submergence of dipped ﬁelds,
which is a part of the emerged magnetic ﬁelds (see also the accompanying movie).
The ﬁeld lines in Fig. 35 show that magnetic reconnection takes place between the
two emerging loops (blue and yellow ﬁeld lines) and creates lower-lying and over-
lying post-reconnection ﬁeld lines (purple and white ﬁeld lines, respectively). Here,
the lower-lying ﬁelds are almost parallel to the central PIL. It is also found that, as a
consequence of Lorentz force exerted by the two emerging loops (expanding arcades)
on both sides of the central PIL, a strong converging ﬂow is excited around it and the
horizontal magnetic ﬁeld becomes aligned more parallel to it.

Later, Knizhnik et al. (2018) surveyed the evolution of kink-unstable tubes with
varying the twist intensity. They revealed, for example, that the separation of both

polarities on the surface becomes smaller (i.e., more compact) with increasing the
twist, which underpins the kink instability as a promising candidate for explaining
δ-spot formation.

It should be noted that the assumed twists in these simulations may be too strong
compared to the twists of the actual ARs. Pevtsov et al. (1994, 1995) quantiﬁed the
twist of ARs by calculating the force-free parameter α, the constant of a force-free

and averaging it over the AR to obtain one global estimate of the twist. The observed
α is typically of the order of 0.01 to 0.1 Mm−1 (e.g., Pevtsov et al. 1995; Leka et al.
1996; Longcope et al. 1998), which yields q . 0.1 Mm−1 under the simple relation
of α ≈ 2q (Longcope and Klapper 1997), though there remains a possibility that the
observed ARs are inclined to regular, ﬂare-quiet ones due to selection bias. On the
other hand, the threshold twist for the kink instability is, say, qcr = 1 Mm−1 for the
typical tube radius of 1 Mm in the deeper convection zone. Therefore, the twists of
the ﬂux tubes assumed in the simulations, q > qcr = 1 Mm−1, are at least one order
of magnitude larger than the observed AR twists, q . 0.1 Mm−1, even though each
elementary bipole in ARs may satisfy the assumed condition (Longcope et al. 1999).

4.1.2 Multi-buoyant segment model

Type 3 δ-spots like the quadrupolar AR NOAA 11158 (Fig. 14), in which two emerg-
ing bipoles collide against each other to form a δ-structure with a ﬂaring PIL in be-
tween, are redolent of a subsurface linkage of the two bipoles. That is, the observed
bipoles are the two emerging sections of a single subsurface ﬂux system, distorted
perhaps by convective buffeting during its rise (Fig. 15(c)).

ρv2/2, L and v are the size scale and speed of the convection, respectively, and CD
is the aerodynamic drag coefﬁcient, which is of order unity. At the bottom of the
convection zone, (L/Rtube)1/2 = 3–5 and Beq ∼ 10 kG (Fan 2009a). In fact, Fan et al.
(2003) numerically demonstrated that ﬂux tubes of Btube ∼ Beq are signiﬁcantly in-
ﬂuenced by turbulent convection. As Fig. 36 shows, the section of the emerging ﬂux
tube within convective upﬂows is strongly pushed up while the downdraft sections
are pinned down. To make things intriguing, the apex of the rising Ω-tube encounters
another local downdraft and takes an M-shaped structure.

eq/(8π) =

Such a situation was modeled by Toriumi et al. (2014b), who reproduced NOAA
11158 (Fig. 14) by simulating the emergence of a single horizontal ﬂux tube that
rises at two sections along the tube. As the photospheric magnetogram of Fig. 37(top)
displays, the two buoyant segments produce a pair of emerging bipoles P1–N1 and
P2–N2, and the inner polarities (N1 and P2) become tightly packed to create a δ-spot.
The strong conﬁnement of the central polarities happens because the two emerging
loops (P1–N1 and P2–N2) are joined by a dipped ﬁeld beneath the photosphere.

These authors also modeled the emergence of two buoyant ﬂux tubes that are
placed closely in parallel (but not connected). In this case, the inner polarities of the
two emerging bipoles move closer but just ﬂy-by and never form a compact δ-spot.
Bottom of Fig. 37 compares the relative motion of the two inner polarities (time evo-
lution of the vector from N1 to P2) for NOAA 11158, the single tube case, and the
double tube case. In the actual AR (see also Fig. 14), P2 continuously drifts along
the southern edge of N1 from east to west in a counter-clockwise direction and be-
comes closer to N1, producing a highly-sheared, strong-gradient PIL. Between the
two simulation cases, only the single tube case shows the monotonic decrease of the
distance. Therefore, they concluded that this Type 3 quadrupolar AR is, between the
two scenarios, more likely to be created from a single multi-buoyant-segment ﬂux
tube.

Exactly the same situation was investigated later by Fang and Fan (2015), but in
a much larger computational domain of a realistic AR size with an adaptive mesh
reﬁnement code to resolve ﬁne-scale structures. Fig. 38 shows three snapshots from
their simulation, which clearly shows that the M-shaped emerging loop produces two
arcades in the corona and, through magnetic reconnection, overlying and lower-lying
ﬁeld lines, which is expected from the coronal observation of NOAA 11158 (see bot-
tom panels of Fig. 14). The striking consistency between the more realistic simulation

and the observation further supports the scenario of multi-buoyant-segment ﬂux tubes
for the Type 3 δ-spots.

4.1.3 Interacting tube model

Another possible origin of the complexity of ARs is the subsurface interaction of
multiple rising ﬂux systems. Based on the study of potential ﬂow around circular
cylinders, Parker (1978, 1979b) predicted that when two cylindrical ﬂux tubes are
rising in a ﬂuid one above the other, the lower tube is attracted toward the other
because of the wake of the tube ahead and, when rising side by side, the tubes attract
each other due to the Bernoulli effect. However, from 2D simulations on the cross-

and another tube is in front of it, rotated by an angle iπ/4 clockwise to it in such a way that RL0/RR0
is parallel and RL4/RR4 is anti-parallel. The solid curves show 2(KEpeak − KE0)/ME0, where KEpeak is
the peak global kinetic energy during the simulation, KE0 is the initial global kinetic energy, and ME0 is
the initial global magnetic energy. The dashed curves show the global magnetic energy near the end of
the simulations normalized by ME0. The dotted circles are the normalized energy levels of 0.15 and 0.3.

sectional evolution, Fan et al. (1998a) found that the interaction of the two tubes is
much more complicated. When the tubes rise side by side, because the wake behind
each tube interacts with that of the other, each tube sheds a succession of eddies
of alternating signs and gains Magnus force in the lateral direction, leading to the
repeated attractive and repulsive motions during their ascents. On the other hand,
when the tubes do not have the same initial height, the tube behind is drawn into the
wake of the tube ahead and eventually merges with it. At the interface between the
two tubes, dissipation of oppositely directed ﬁeld components (twists) occurs.

Linton et al. (2001) focused more on magnetic reconnection between two strongly-
twisted ﬂux tubes in the 3D low-β volume (i.e., the solar corona) to study the trigger-
ing of ﬂares and eruptions. They found that, depending on the helicity (twist handed-

ness) and the relative angle of the tube axes, the interaction can be classiﬁed into four
distinct classes (see Fig. 39): (1) bounce, in which the two tubes bounce off each other
with very little reconnection, occurring for example between parallel counter-helicity
tubes (RL0); (2) merge, in which the tubes merge due to reconnection of azimuthal
components, e.g., between parallel co-helicity tubes (RR0: bottom of Fig. 39); (3)
slingshot, in which the tubes reconnect and “slingshot” away in a manner analogous
to the classical 2D reconnection, e.g., between anti-parallel counter-helicity tubes
(RL4); and (4) tunnel, in which ﬁeld lines of the tubes undergo reconnection twice
and the tubes pass through each other, occurring when the co-helicity tubes are placed
in the orthogonal direction like RR6. These interactions were also investigated by
Sakai and Koide (1992). Linton and Antiochos (2005) and Linton (2006) demon-
strated that the situations may differ depending on the level of twist and the balance
of magnetic ﬂux contained in the two tubes.

Murray and Hood (2007) simulated the interaction of emerging ﬂux tubes in the
stratiﬁed high-β medium representing the solar interior. They examined the cases

62

Shin Toriumi, Haimin Wang

where two horizontal tubes are placed in such a way that the lower one is buoyant
whereas the upper one remains stable. For the case of parallel tubes, or LL0 (the
mirror symmetry of RR0) following the notation by Linton et al. (2001), they found
that the tubes gradually merge, though not totally, and the photospheric magnetogram
shows a simple ying-yang pattern similar to that of the single tube case (like in Fig. 4).
Of more interest is the case with orthogonal tubes in Fig. 40, or LL2 (corresponding
to RR6), where the two tubes are expected to perform a slingshot reconnection due to
their lower degrees of twist (Linton 2006). The authors found that, as opposed to the
expectation, the two tubes do not undergo a complete slingshot because the tubes dif-
fer much in strength. The resultant magnetogram becomes much more complicated.
As Fig. 40 illustrates, the polarity layout is at ﬁrst positive negative from left to right
when the upper tube emerges. However, as the lower tube reaches the photosphere,
the layout reveals a quadrupolar structure and transits to negative positive, eventually
recovering the classical ying-yang pattern.

The interaction of two emerging ﬂux tubes inside the solar interior was also ex-
amined by Jouve et al. (2018) in a global scale. By extending their anelastic MHD
models of the ﬂux emergence in a spherical convective shell with large-scale mean
ﬂows (e.g., Jouve et al. 2013), they conducted simulations on the pairs of emerg-
ing toroidal loops that have different combinations of the twist handedness and axial
direction. They found that if the two loops are given opposite handedness and the
same axial direction or the same handedness but opposite axial direction, they bounce
against each other through rising, which is in good agreement with RL0 and RR4 of
Linton et al. (2001). Consequently, as in the top panels of Fig. 41, the map of the
radial magnetic ﬁeld near the top boundary (substituting the solar surface) shows a
quadrupolar region constituted of two emerging bipoles. On the other hand, the case
with parallel co-helicity loops (corresponding to RR0) yields a simple bipolar pat-
tern due to the merging of the loops (Fig. 41 (bottom)), just like the ﬁrst model of
Murray and Hood (2007). However, in such a case, the non-neutralized currents, sug-
gested to be the origin of eruptive events (Sect. 3.2.5), are much more pronounced
than the other cases because the return currents contained in the periphery of each
loop are annihilated at the current sheet between the merging loops. From the series
of simulation runs in Jouve et al. (2018), a variety of AR structures are formed by in-
teraction of two rising ﬂux tubes, from simple bipolar to complex quadrupolar ones.
Since the magnetograms investigated in this study are at 0.93R⊙ (i.e., about 50 Mm
below the actual surface of the Sun) due to the limitation of anelastic models, further
investigations with the fully compressible calculations that enable the direct access
to the surface are needed to elaborate how much of the emerging ﬂux does reach the
photosphere and what the possible AR conﬁgurations at the surface are.

ARs with much higher degree of complexity were modeled by Prior and MacTag-
gart (2016), who simulated the buoyant emergence of braided magnetic ﬁelds from
the convection zone to the corona. For instance, their “pigtail” ﬁeld, in which three
ﬂux tubes are entangled with each other, develops a magnetogram with a number
of positive and negative polarities intertwined: see Fig. 13 of Prior and MacTaggart
(2016).

4.1.4 Effect of turbulent convection

As we have discussed in Sect. 2.1 and above, thermal convection exerts a diverse
range of impacts on the emerging ﬂux, and the series of realistic simulations have
revealed the dynamic interactions between the magnetic ﬁelds and convective ﬂows,
such as boost-up and pin-down of large-scale emerging ﬁelds (Fan et al. 2003; Jouve
and Brun 2009), elongation of the surface granular cells (Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2008;
Cheung et al. 2008), and the local undulation of emerging ﬁelds (Tortosa-Andreu and
Moreno-Insertis 2009; Fang et al. 2010; Cheung et al. 2010).

Fang et al. (2012b,a) simulated the buoyant rise of a twisted ﬂux tube from the
convection zone in which turbulent convection resides. Fig. 42 shows the evolution
of photospheric magnetograms, which reveals the rapid growth of magnetic concen-
trations (spots) with the unsigned total ﬂux of up to 1.37 × 1021 Mx (at t = 5 hr),
the strong spot rotations (see the large negative spot at x = 6 Mm), and the shearing
and converging motions around the PIL. Here, both the shearing and rotational mo-
tions are driven by the Lorentz force and these motions transfer the magnetic energy
and helicity into the corona (consistent with, e.g., Manchester 2001; Fan 2001b). The
authors found that the convection-driven convergence ﬂow produces a strong mag-
netic gradient and ﬂux cancellation at the PIL. Together with the shear ﬂow, the ﬁeld
lines above the PIL undergo a tether-cutting reconnection and produce long overly-
ing sheared arcades and short submerging loops (Moore et al. 2001). Comparison of
the model and extrapolated ﬁeld lines in Fig. 43 clearly illustrates the development of
non-potential, sigmoidal structure above the PIL that is covered by the more potential
coronal loops.

66

Shin Toriumi, Haimin Wang

Similar convective emergence simulation was also performed by Chatterjee et al.
(2016), who employed a horizontal magnetic ﬂux sheet instead of a tube at the start of
the simulation. The ﬂux sheet breaks up into several ﬂux bundles due to the undular
mode instability (Fan 2001a) and develops into a large-scale U-shaped loop, which
appears in the photosphere as a pair of colliding ﬂux concentrations (i.e., a δ-spot).
The strong cancellation between the two spots manifests as a series of ﬂare eruptions
with magnitudes comparable to GOES C- and B-class events (Kors´os et al. 2018).
Through the creation of a δ-spot and the ﬂaring activity, they observed the repeated
formation of cool dense ﬁlaments above the PIL and the ejection of helical ﬂux ropes.
Another intriguing possibility of δ-spot formation was suggested by Mitra et al.
(2014), who conducted the direct numerical simulation of the strong stratiﬁed dy-
namo with forced turbulence. Their 3D computation box holds two-layered turbu-
lence, the helical and large-scale dynamo in the lower layer and the non-helical tur-
bulence in the upper layer. As a result, they observed the formation of strong bipolar
ﬂux concentrations with super-equipartition ﬁelds, which sometimes move closer to
take a δ-spot conﬁguration. While the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld in the deeper layer
is created through a large-scale dynamo (α effect), the spontaneous spot formation
in the upper layer may be due to the so-called negative effective magnetic pressure
instability (NEMPI), which is caused by suppression of the turbulent hydromagnetic
pressure and tension due to the mean magnetic ﬁeld (Brandenburg et al. 2011).

4.1.5 Toward the general picture

The numerical simulations introduced above have suggested the possibility that dif-
ferent types of ﬂare-productive ARs have different subsurface origins and evolution
histories (Zirin and Liggett 1987; Toriumi et al. 2017b). For example, the δ-spots
of Types 1 (Spot-spot) and 3 (Quadrupole) may be produced from the kinked and
multi-buoyant-segment ﬂux systems, respectively (Linton et al. 1999; Fan et al. 1999;
Takasao et al. 2015; Toriumi et al. 2014b; Fang and Fan 2015).

In order to scrutinize the differences between the above three cases plus another
type of X-ﬂaring ARs, the Inter-AR case, created by two independent but closely
neighboring episodes of ﬂux emergence, Toriumi and Takasao (2017) conducted a
systematic survey of ﬂux emergence simulations by using similar numerical con-
ditions with as little difference as possible, and explored the formation of δ-spots,
ﬂaring PILs, and their evolution processes. Figure 44 summarizes the numerical con-
ditions and results. For the Spot-spot case, the initial twist strength is intensiﬁed so
as to exceed the critical value for the kink instability (Linton et al. 1996, see also
Sect. 4.1.1). The Spot-satellite is modeled by introducing a parasitic ﬂux tube above
the main tube in a direction perpendicular to it, the situation similar to the interacting
tube models in Sect. 4.1.3. The Spot-satellite may also be produced from a single
bifurcating tube, which, however, was not considered for the sake of simplicity. The
Quadrupole ﬂux tube has two buoyant sections along the axis, resembling the sim-
ulations in Sect. 4.1.2. Finally, for the Inter-AR case, two ﬂux tubes are placed in
parallel.

As the movie of Fig. 44 demonstrates, all cases except for Inter-AR produce δ-
shaped polarities with strongly-sheared, strong-gradient PILs in their cores that are

coupled with ﬂow motions, but the most drastic evolution appears for the Spot-spot
case. As discussed in Sect. 4.1.1, the knotted apex enhances the buoyancy that leads
to the fastest emergence among the four cases. The total unsigned magnetic ﬂux in

where Bpot is the potential ﬁeld, are also largest for the Spot-spot case.

It is also suggested from these models that the difference in initial simulation
setup may determine the fate of a CME eruption. As shown in Fig. 45, in the case
of Spot-satellite, Quadrupole, and Inter-AR, the newly formed ﬂux rope above the

nection of emerged loops indicated with yellow and green lines. Except for the Spot-spot case, the ﬂux

sheared PIL is exposed to outer space, an ideal situation for successful CME eruption.
However, in the Spot-spot case, the ﬂux rope is trapped and conﬁned by the overlying
loops. Very strong conﬁnement may explain the ﬂare-rich but CME-poor nature of
the Spot-spot AR NOAA 12192 (see Fig. 1 and discussion on successful and failed
eruptions in Sect. 2.2).

In addition, this model is able to account for the formation of “magnetic chan-
nels,” another important feature of the ﬂaring PILs (Zirin and Wang 1993a, see Sect. 3.2.1).
In the magnetogram of the Spot-spot case (Fig. 44), one may ﬁnd that the central PIL
has an elongated alternating pattern of positive and negative polarities, resembling

Flare-productive active regions

69

the magnetic channel. This structure is produced because the photospheric ﬁelds are
highly inclined to horizontal and almost parallel to the PIL with slight undulations.

The series of simulations above provides a uniﬁed, general view of the birth of
ﬂare-productive ARs. Within the solar interior, probably due to convective evolution,
the emerging ﬂux systems that form δ-spots are severely twisted to take on tortuous
structures, partially pinned down to bear multiple rising segments, bifurcated into
entangled branches, or hit against other ﬂux systems to undergo mutual interactions.
All of these processes are prone to enhancement of free magnetic energy. As the
ﬂuxes reach the photosphere, complex magnetic structures, prominently manifested
by δ-spots, sheared PILs, sheared coronal arcades, and ﬂux ropes, develop. The δ-
spots are likely generated by multiple emerging loops instead of a single Ω-loop, and
the different patterns of polarity layouts, such as Types 1, 2, and 3, stem from the
difference in the subsurface evolution. Even two separated, seemingly independent
ARs may intensify the free energy if located in the closer proximity (Inter-AR case).
The stored free energy is, if accumulated enough, released in the form of ﬂares and
CMEs.

One possibility that was not considered in Toriumi and Takasao (2017) is the
situation where a new, delayed ﬂux emerges into a pre-existing ﬂux system (i.e.
the concepts of successive emergence, complexes of activities, and sunspot nests in
Sect. 3.1). Schrijver (2007) interpreted the formations of ﬂaring PILs with this idea,
and Welsch and Li (2008) overall agreed. This situation is qualitatively similar to the
Spot-satellite case, in which a minor bipole appears in the close proximity to the ma-
jor sunspot, but the scale is much larger. Therefore, toward a more complete view, we
may need to take into account this successive emergence case.

4.2 Flux cancellation models

It is thought that coronal ﬂux ropes can also form post-emergence as a coronal re-
sponse to photospheric driving. Antiochos et al. (1994) and DeVore and Antiochos
(2000) demonstrated that a sheared arcade lying above a PIL, produced by shearing
motion in the photosphere (without convergence), contains a dipped structure that
supports the prominence material. In the theory of van Ballegooijen and Martens
(1989) (see Fig. 26), coronal loops above the PIL become sheared and converged
due to photospheric motions and eventually reconnect against each other to form a
ﬂux rope. Most of the simulations based on this theory, often referred to as the “ﬂux
cancellation” models, deal with the evolution of coronal ﬁeld lines within the compu-
tational box above the photospheric surface, i.e., the situation after the magnetic ﬂux
is emerged.

Figure 46 shows the representative 3D calculation by Amari et al. (2003a). Here,
the original potential ﬁeld (panel a) is twisted by two co-rotating vortices imposed at
the photospheric boundary. After the system is relaxed (panel b), converging motion
is applied and magnetic reconnection between the sheared loops leads to the forma-
tion of a twisted ﬂux rope, with a small low-lying arcade below, and an overlying
arcade above (panel c). As the reconnection goes on, the unstable ﬂux rope is ejected
(panel d).

Field lines of the magnetic conﬁguration after the converging ﬂow is applied from t0 = 400τA to 450τA,
where the unit τA denotes the Alfv´en transit time. Shown is the case for ts = 200τA, in which the sheared
loops are obvious around the PIL. (c) The state after the convergence is applied to t = 498τA. A helical
ﬂux rope, low-lying arcade, and overlying arcade are now formed through magnetic reconnection between
the sheared loops. (d) The convergence is further applied to t = 530τA. The ﬂux rope erupts upward with
entraining the overlying arcades successively.

For instigating the ﬂux cancellation of sheared loops, several types of mecha-
nisms have been considered (see, e.g., Mackay et al. 2010; Aulanier 2014). Other
than the convergence ﬂow (Amari et al. 2003a; Aulanier et al. 2010), proposed mech-
anisms include decrease of photospheric ﬂux through shearing motion (Amari et al.
2000, 2010), turbulent diffusion (Amari et al. 2003b; Mackay and van Ballegooijen
2006; Yeates and Mackay 2009; Aulanier et al. 2010), and reversal of magnetic shear
(Kusano et al. 2004).

Kusano et al. (2012) investigated the process where the sheared arcade ﬁeld above
the PIL reconnects to create a ﬂux rope and erupts, triggered by emerging ﬂux from
the photospheric surface (rather than the convergence ﬂow or diffusion). This model
sheds light on the importance of small-scale magnetic structures, which are often
observed around ﬂaring PILs, in the destabilization of the entire system (Toriumi et al.
2013a; Bamba et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2017b). In the particular simulation case of
Fig. 47, emerging ﬂux with the ﬁeld direction opposite to that of the arcades triggers

the reconnection and produces an erupting ﬂux rope. From a systematic survey on the
orientations of arcade and emerging ﬂux, it was found that there exist two kinds of
emerging ﬂux capable of initiating the cancellation: the opposite-polarity type (shown
as Fig. 47) and the reversed-shear type (comparable to Kusano et al. 2004).

As a more recent attempt, Xia et al. (2014), Xia and Keppens (2016), and Kaneko
and Yokoyama (2017) performed 3D ﬂux cancellation simulations that take into ac-
count the effect of thermodynamical processes. Due to the strong radiative cooling,

72

Shin Toriumi, Haimin Wang

coronal plasma within the helical ﬁeld lines of the ﬂux rope becomes condensed and
piles up on the dipped part at the bottom. In this way, these authors successfully re-
produced ﬁlaments (prominences) in a more realistic manner than those lacking in
the thermodynamical processes.

4.3 Data-constrained and data-driven models

4.3.1 Field extrapolation methods

One way to trace the development of coronal magnetic ﬁeld is to sequentially com-
pute the ﬁeld lines from the routinely measured photospheric magnetograms by using
extrapolation methods which neglect non-magnetic forces (such as pressure gradient)
and assume that the Lorentz force vanishes, i.e., the force-free condition,

where j is the current density

j × B = 0,

j =

c
4π

∇ × B.

(19)

(20)

The potential (current-free) ﬁeld is the simplest approximation, under which ∇ ×

B = 0. This can be replaced by

B = −∇ψ,

(21)

where ψ is the scalar potential, and combined with the solenoidal condition (∇ · B =
0), further rewritten as

∇2ψ = 0.

(22)

The potential coronal ﬁeld is calculated by solving this equation with using the nor-
mal component of the photospheric ﬁeld Bz as the boundary condition. Schrijver
et al. (2005) and Schrijver (2016) assessed the non-potentiality of coronal ﬁelds of
95 and 41 ARs by comparing potential ﬁeld extrapolations to the corresponding coro-
nal images from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE; Handy et al.
1999) and SDO/AIA, respectively. They concluded that, in most cases, signiﬁcant
non-potentiality exists in ARs with newly emerging ﬂux within ∼ 30 hours or when
opposite-polarity concentrations are evolving and in close contact.

The force-free condition, Eq. (19), is also expressed as

∇ × B = αB,

(23)

where α is called the force-free parameter. If α is constant everywhere in the coro-
nal volume under consideration, the magnetic ﬁeld is called a linear force-free ﬁeld
(LFFF); otherwise, a non-linear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF). In these models, all com-
ponents of the vector magnetogram are used as the bottom boundary condition. As
Figs. 26 and 31 show, the NLFFF extrapolations provide realistic coronal ﬁelds com-
parable to the actual observations. By applying NLFFF methods to the complex

quadrupolar AR NOAA 11967, Liu et al. (2016b) and Kawabata et al. (2017) inves-
tigated the topology of coronal ﬁelds and elucidated the homologous occurrence of
X-shaped ﬂares. However, it has been shown that the NLFFF models are sensitive to
the quality of photospheric boundary conditions, and thus do not faithfully reproduce
observed coronal loop structures (e.g., DeRosa et al. 2009, 2015). Moreover, the in-
put vector magnetograms are subject to the intrinsic ambiguity in the direction of the
transverse magnetic ﬁeld and this hampers fundamentally any magnetogram-driven
coronal ﬁeld reconstructions.

Representative NLFFF techniques include the optimization method, MHD re-
laxation method, and ﬂux-rope insertion method. For the basis and comparison of
various extrapolation methods, we refer the reader to DeRosa et al. (2009, 2015),
Wiegelmann and Sakurai (2012), and Inoue (2016).

4.3.2 Data-constrained models

Even if one applies the most sophisticated technique of the NLFFF extrapolations to
the accurate sequential magnetograms by Hinode/SOT and SDO/HMI, the obtained
temporal evolution is still far from the real one because these models unavoidably
assume a static state. One approach to overcome this issue is to use time-evolving
data-constrained modeling. In this more physics-based method, the temporal evolu-
tion is obtained by solving the MHD equations with setting the reconstructed coronal
ﬁeld for the initial condition. Jiang et al. (2013) were the ﬁrst to apply this method
to the actual AR. As in Fig. 48, they reconstructed the initial coronal ﬁeld of AR
NOAA 11283 with the NLFFF model and demonstrated the CME eruption from this
AR. According to the authors, due to small numerical errors in the extrapolation (i.e.,

their NLFFF was not perfectly force free), the system became unstable and the ﬂux
rope was erupted via the torus instability.

Since then, the data-constrained approach has become the hot topic (Kliem et al.
2013; Amari et al. 2014). Inoue et al. (2014, 2015) modeled the X2.2-class event in
NOAA 11158 (Fig. 14) and found that, interestingly, the ﬂux rope at the core of this
AR does not erupt directly but rather reconnects with ambient weakly twisted ﬁelds.
Then, the ambient ﬁeld transforms into a ﬂux rope, which eventually exceeds the

Flare-productive active regions

75

critical height of the torus instability. Muhamad et al. (2017) applied this method to
NOAA 10930 (e.g., Figs. 6 and 19) and, by inserting emerging ﬂux at the PIL from
the bottom boundary, they succeeded in triggering the ﬂux rope eruption, which is in
line with the ﬂare-triggering scenario by Kusano et al. (2012). The dramatic eruption
in the X9.3 ﬂare in NOAA 12673, which we introduced in Sect. 3.4, was modeled
by Inoue et al. (2018b). They found that, as in Fig. 49, multiple compact ﬂux ropes
lying along the sheared PIL reconnect with each other and merge into a large, highly
twisted ﬂux rope that eventually erupts.

4.3.3 Data-driven models

Even more realistic reconstruction of the evolving coronal ﬁeld is to sequentially
update the photospheric boundary condition, which is called the data-driven model.
The ﬁrst approach of the data-driven models we show here is the magneto-frictional
method (Yang et al. 1986), in which the magnetic ﬁeld evolves due to the Lorentz
force,

v =

1
νc

j × B,

(24)

where ν is the frictional coefﬁcient. In this formulation, the (pseudo) velocity is sim-
ply proportional to the Lorentz force. Cheung and DeRosa (2012) applied this method
to the sequential magnetogram of NOAA 11158 and reproduced ﬂux ropes that were
ejected in the series of M- and X-class ﬂares in this AR.

Another recent, yet nascent attempt is to directly solve the MHD equations with
sequentially replacing the magnetogram to self-consistently reconstruct the coronal
evolution (Wu et al. 2006). This was demonstrated by Jiang et al. (2016a,b) for ARs
NOAA 11283 and 12192, respectively. Hayashi et al. (2018) calculated the photo-
spheric electric ﬁeld E from the sequential magnetogram B and drove the model of
NOAA 11158 through Faraday’s law

∂B
∂t

= −c∇ × E,

instead of solving the induction equation

∂B
∂t

= ∇ × (v × B).

(25)

(26)

Here, E is determined, for instance, by solving Ohm’s law (E = −V × B/c) by using
the velocity V obtained with ﬂow tracking techniques (see Welsch et al. 2007, and
references therein). As Fig. 50 displays, the initial coronal ﬁeld, obtained by matching
the potential ﬁeld to the observed vector magnetogram and relaxing it, undergoes
substantial elongation and twisting, especially above the central PIL, in response to
the shear motion in the photosphere.

A data-driven, dynamic model is supposed to calculate the coronal ﬁeld that
matches the changing photospheric magnetogram. An accurate model would, in prin-
ciple, produce a ﬂare or eruption at the same time that the actual Sun does. Inevitable
simpliﬁcations of the model and inaccuracies in its initial state, however, suggest that

it may be difﬁcult to reproduce ﬂares or eruptions. This is because the observed, grad-
ual photospheric change (before and around the ﬂare onset) might be insufﬁcient to
cause any drastic change in the (inaccurate) model’s coronal ﬁeld.

Another caveat is that the model is limited by the temporal frequency of the driv-
ing data. Using the ﬂux emergence simulation as the ground-truth data set, Leake
et al. (2017) performed a data-driven simulation with the assumption that the photo-
spheric information is provided every 12 minutes (the default cadence of the SDO/HMI
vector magnetogram). They showed that the data-driven models can reproduce the
slowly emerging ARs over 25 hour with only ∼ 1% error in the free magnetic energy.
However, the modeling was largely affected by rapidly evolving features. Even if one
applies interpolation to the driving data, the coarse sampling generates a strobe ef-
fect, in which smoothly evolving features appear to jump across the photosphere. For
an emerging bipole with a spatial extent of L = 1 Mm with an apparent horizontal
velocity of vh = 20 km s−1, the sampling interval needs to be less than L/vh = 50 s.
Note that this may be partly overcome by using faster-cadence LOS magnetograms.

4.4 Summary of this section

In this section, we presented theoretical investigations that try to address the subsur-
face origin and physical mechanisms behind the large-scale/long-term evolution of
ﬂare-producing ARs. We ﬁrst showed in the beginning of Sect. 4.1 that classical ﬂux
emergence simulations of the Ω-loop emergence can explain several characteristics,

Flare-productive active regions

77

such as magnetic tongues, formation of ﬂux ropes and sigmoids, generation of shear
ﬂows and spot rotation, helicity injection, and non-neutralized currents. However,
most of these models do not reproduce other important features of ﬂaring ARs such
as the highly-sheared PIL between closely neighboring opposite-polarity sunspots.

From the observational evidence of emergence of top-curled ﬂux tube, the helical
kink instability was invoked as the possible production mechanism of the δ-sunspots
(Sect. 4.1.1). 3D models demonstrate that (1) a tightly twisted tube develops a kink
instability; (2) the rise speed of the kinked tube is accelerated due to the enhanced
buoyancy; and (3) the tube reproduces a quadrupolar polarity pattern with a sheared
PIL on the photospheric surface. These models can reproduce the observed charac-
teristics of Type 1 (Spot-spot) δ-spots.

Type 3 (Quadrupole) δ-spots may be produced by the emergence of a ﬂux tube
with multiple buoyant segments (Sect. 4.1.2). Such a top-dent conﬁguration is in fact
created in a large-scale convective emergence model. Inspired by the observation of
the quadrupolar AR NOAA 11158, the emergence of a ﬂux tube that rises at two
sections along the axis was investigated. It was found that the time evolution of the
photospheric polarities, i.e., the collision, shearing, and converging motions of the
central bipole, is fairly consistent with that of the actual AR. Such evolutions were
not achieved by a pair of emerging ﬂux tubes that are placed in parallel. Together
with the follow-up study, the multi-buoyant segment model is considered as a likely
candidate for quadrupolar δ-spots.

Interaction of emerging ﬂux systems is also recognized as a source of complexity
(Sect. 4.1.3). In fact, 3D simulations showed that complex-shaped ARs can be created
by interaction of multiple tubes in the solar interior. One interesting consequence of
the interaction, both aerodynamic and bodily, is that even simple bipolar ARs may
originate from multiple ﬂux systems through merging. In this case, non-neutralized
currents can be signiﬁcant because the return currents are annihilated.

Turbulent convection results in a multitude of effects on the rising ﬂux (Sect. 4.1.4).
The convective emergence simulation revealed that the two polarities on the photo-
sphere undergo shearing and rotational motion due to the Lorentz force and that the
converging motion at the PIL causes ﬂux cancellation, which leads to the production
of a ﬂux rope in the atmosphere. It was also found that the strong collision of opposite
polarities results in a series of ﬂare eruptions.

With the aim to obtain a uniﬁed perspective of production of ﬂaring ARs, a com-
parison of different modeling setups was performed (Sect. 4.1.5). It was assumed
that the production of Spot-spot, Spot-satellite, Quadrupole, and Inter-AR types are
due to the emergence of a kink-unstable tube, two interacting tubes, a multi-buoyant-
segment tube, and two independent tubes, respectively. Although all models except
for the Inter-AR case successfully reproduced δ-spots with ﬂaring PILs, the Spot-spot
case showed a by far fastest rising with the largest free magnetic energy. Therefore,
the difference in the observed evolution on the solar surface likely stems from the
subsurface history, probably caused by turbulent convection, such as a strong twist-
ing, downward pinning, and collision with other ﬂux systems.

Flux rope formation and the consequent eruption have been extensively surveyed
in the sheared arcade and ﬂux cancellation models (Sect. 4.2). Many of these sim-
ulation models are based on the ﬁlament formation theory by van Ballegooijen and

78

Shin Toriumi, Haimin Wang

Martens (1989): the coronal ﬁelds are tied to the photospheric bottom boundary and
the photospheric motion, such as shearing, converging, and/or diffusion, drives the
overall evolution. However, the reversed-shear and small-scale emerging ﬁeld at the
PIL are also suggested as the trigger of magnetic reconnection between coronal ar-
cades. Flux cancellation models that take into account the effect of thermodynamics
now reproduce the condensation of ﬁlament plasma due to radiative cooling.

Along with the extrapolation methods (Sect. 4.3.1), recent progress in the more
physics-based modeling of the coronal ﬁeld is facilitated by the development in mag-
netographs, especially by the advanced vector magnetograms of Hinode/SOT and
SDO/HMI. There are two methods in this category, which are data-constrained mod-
els, where a single snapshot is used for creating the initial coronal ﬁeld (Sect. 4.3.2),
and data-driven models, where the bottom boundary is sequentially updated to drive
the calculation (Sect. 4.3.3). These methods, although still in the stage of develop-
ment, provide the means to trace the evolution of coronal ﬁelds in a more realistic
manner, such as the formation of ﬂux ropes in response to the photospheric motion
and the resultant eruptions, and may open the door to real-time space weather fore-
casting.

5 Rapid changes of magnetic ﬁelds associated with ﬂares

As we saw in the previous sections, the gradual magnetic ﬁeld evolution (in the time
scale of hours to days) is the key factor for the energy build up of solar eruptions.
Then, can solar eruptions in the corona cause rapid (within minutes) magnetic ﬁeld
changes in the photosphere? The changes in the photosphere in response to the coro-
nal eruptions have been expected to be small because the photospheric plasma den-
sity is much larger than that of the corona. Aulanier (2016) gave a review of this topic
from both observational and modeling perspectives and provided a physical analysis
of this issue called the “tail wags the dog” problem. Under certain circumstances, the
coronal eruption can cause rapid changes in the photospheric magnetic topology.

Earlier, Hudson et al. (2008) and Fisher et al. (2012) quantitatively assessed the
back reaction on the solar surface and interior resulting from the coronal ﬁeld evo-
lution required to release energy and made the prediction that after ﬂares, the pho-
tospheric magnetic ﬁeld would become more horizontal at the ﬂaring PILs. Their
analysis is based on the principle of energy and momentum conservation and builds
upon the proposal by Hudson (2000) that the coronal ﬁeld should, in an overall sense,
contract or implode if there is a net decrease in magnetic energy (coronal implosion).
This is one of the very few models that speciﬁcally predict that magnetic destabiliza-
tion associated with ﬂares can be accompanied by rapid and permanent changes of
photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and the pattern of the ﬁeld changes. One special case
related to this scenario is the tether-cutting reconnection model for sigmoids (Moore
et al. 2001; Moore and Sterling 2006), which involves a two-stage reconnection pro-
cess. At the eruption onset, the near-surface reconnection between the two sigmoid
elbows produces a low-lying shorter loop across the PIL and a larger twisted ﬂux rope
connecting the two far ends of the sigmoid. The second stage reconnection occurs
when the large-scale loop cuts through the arcade ﬁelds, which causes the erupting

ﬂux rope to evolve into a CME and precipitation of electrons to produce ﬂare rib-
bons (see Fig. 7(a) for illustration). If scrutinizing the magnetic topology close to the
surface, one would ﬁnd a permanent change of magnetic ﬁelds that conforms to the
scenario as described above: the magnetic ﬁelds turn more horizontal near the ﬂaring
PIL due to the newly formed short loops there.

Whereas an earlier review by Wang and Liu (2015) summarizes certain aspects
of research up to that time, focusing primarily on the results obtained before the SDO
era, this section summarizes more recent observational ﬁndings of rapid magnetic
ﬁeld and sunspot structure changes associated with ﬂares and brieﬂy discusses the
related theoretical insights.

5.1 Magnetic transients

Before the discovery of the persistent photospheric magnetic ﬁeld changes associated
with ﬂares, some studies showed observations of the so-called “magnetic transients”–
the rapid, but short-lived change in the LOS magnetic ﬁelds. In the earlier studies
(e.g., Tanaka 1978; Patterson 1984), these apparent transient reversals of magnetic
polarity associated with ﬂare footpoint emissions were interpreted as real physical
effects of change in magnetic topology. Some later studies demonstrated that the
short-lived magnetic transients are the observational effect due to changes in proﬁles
of observing spectral lines caused by the ﬂare emissions (Kosovichev and Zharkova

2001; Qiu and Gary 2003; Zhao et al. 2009), so they are sometimes called magnetic
anomalies. The most comprehensive study in this topic is a recent paper by Sun et al.
(2017), who analyzed the 135-s cadence HMI data and demonstrated the line proﬁle
changes and associated ﬁeld signatures of transients (Fig. 51). Non-LTE9 modeling
by Hong et al. (2018) explained the proﬁle changes of Fe I 6173 ˚A line that the HMI
uses and provided a quantitative assessment of magnetic transients. Song et al. (2018)
suggested that magnetic transients and white-light ﬂares are closely related spatially
and temporally.

All the above magnetic transients are for the LOS component of the magnetic
ﬁelds. Taking advantage of the unprecedented resolution provided by the 1.6-m GST
at BBSO, Xu et al. (2018) showed a sudden rotation of the magnetic ﬁeld vector by
about 12◦–20◦ counterclockwise, in association with the M6.5-class ﬂare on June 22,
2015. Such changes of the azimuth angles of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld are well

9 In local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE), it is assumed that the state of plasma is described simply
by the Saha-Boltzmann equations, i.e., as a function of the local kinetic temperature and electron density
alone. Non-LTE indicates that this assumption is not valid.

pronounced within a ribbon-like structure (∼ 600 km in width), moving co-spatially
and co-temporally with the ﬂare emission as seen in the Hα line (see Fig. 52). How-
ever, they are not related to the magnetic transients as shown above. A strong spatial
correlation between the azimuth transient and the ribbon front indicates that the en-
ergetic electron beams are very likely the cause of the rotation. During the rotation,
the measured azimuth becomes closer to that of the potential ﬁeld, which indicates
the process of energy release (untwisting motion) in the associated ﬂare loop. The
magnetic ﬁelds restored their original direction after the ﬂare ribbons swept through
over the area. This was the ﬁrst time that a transient ﬁeld rotation was observed.
Possible explanations of this phenomenon include (1) effect of induced magnetic
ﬁelds; (2) effect of downward-drafting plasma; (3) polarization of emission lines due
to return current and/or ﬁlamentary chromospheric evaporation (different from the
original concept of magnetic transient); and (4) effect of Alfv´en waves. The authors
claimed that the observed ﬁeld change cannot be explained by existing models. This
new, transient magnetic signature in the photosphere may offer a new diagnostic tool
for future modeling of magnetic reconnection and the resulting energy release.

5.2 Rapid, persistent magnetic ﬁeld changes

In the early 1990s, the Caltech solar group discovered obvious rapid and permanent
changes of vector magnetic ﬁelds associated with the ﬂares using the BBSO data
(Wang 1992; Wang et al. 1994a). They found that the transverse ﬁeld shows much
more prominent changes compared to the LOS component. Some of the results ap-
peared to be puzzling: the magnetic shear angle (an indicator of non-potentiality),
deﬁned as the angular difference between the potential magnetic ﬁeld and the mea-
sured ﬁeld (see Sect. 3.2.1), increases following ﬂares. It is well known that, in order
to release the energy for a ﬂare to occur, the coronal magnetic ﬁeld has to evolve to a
more relaxed state to release energy. For this reason, there have been some doubts to
these earlier measurements, especially because the data were obtained from ground-
based observatories that may suffer from certain effects such as atmospheric seeing
and lack of continuous observing coverage.

Kosovichev and Zharkova (2001) studied high-resolution SOHO/MDI magne-
togram data for the “Bastille Day Flare” on 2000 July 14, and found regions with
a permanent decrease of magnetic ﬂux, which are related to the release of magnetic
energy. Using high cadence GONG data, Sudol and Harvey (2005) found solid evi-
dence of step-wise ﬁeld changes associated with a number of ﬂares. The time scale
of the changes is as fast as 10 minutes (GONG cadence is 1 minute), and magnitude
of change is in the order of 100 G. Petrie and Sudol (2010), Johnstone et al. (2012),
Cliver et al. (2012), and Burtseva and Petrie (2013) also surveyed more comprehen-
sively the rapid and permanent changes of LOS magnetic ﬁelds with GONG data,
which were indeed associated with almost all the X-class ﬂares studied by them.

The above studies using the LOS ﬁeld data demonstrated the step-wise property
of ﬂare-related photospheric magnetic ﬁeld change. However, the underlying cause
of those changes was not clearly revealed. The work by Cameron and Sammis (1999)
was the ﬁrst to use near-limb magnetograph observations to characterize ﬂare-related

82

changes of magnetic ﬁelds, taking advantage of the projection effect. In a number of
papers, it was found that, for the LOS magnetic ﬁeld, the limb-ward ﬂux increases
in general, while the disk-ward ﬂux in the ﬂaring ARs decreases (Wang et al. 2002b;
Wang 2006; Yurchyshyn et al. 2004; Spirock et al. 2002; Wang and Liu 2010). Such
a behavior suggests that after ﬂares, the overall magnetic ﬁeld structure of ARs may
change from a more vertical to a more horizontal conﬁguration, which is consistent
with the scenario that the Lorentz force change pushes down the ﬁeld lines. Note that
most of the observations listed in Wang and Liu (2010) are made by SOHO/MDI,
which has a cadence of up to one minute. The drastic change in inclination angle of
magnetic ﬁelds in sunspots associated with the ﬂare eruption was also detected by
Ye et al. (2016) by using vector magnetograms from the SDO/HMI, and the observa-
tional result was consistent with the expectation of the coronal implosion scenario.

As more and more evidence indicates the irreversible photospheric magnetic ﬁeld
changes following ﬂares, it is natural to ﬁnd whether these changes are detectable in
white-light structures of ARs. The white-light signatures of topological changes are
indeed discovered in a number of papers (e.g. Wang et al. 2004a; Liu et al. 2005;
Deng et al. 2005; Li et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2009, 2013, 2018b). The most prominent
changes are the enhancement (i.e., darkening) of penumbral structure near the ﬂaring
PILs and the decay of penumbral structure in the peripheral sides (outer edges) of
δ-spots. Fig. 53 clearly demonstrates some examples of such spot structure changes.
The difference image between pre- and post-ﬂare states always shows a dark patch
at the ﬂaring PIL that is surrounded by a bright ring. They correspond to the en-
hancement of the central sunspot penumbrae and the decay of the peripheral penum-
brae, respectively. These examples were discussed in detail by Liu et al. (2005), in

which they showed that (1) these rapid changes are associated with ﬂares and are
permanent, and (2) the decay of sunspot penumbrae is related to the magnetic ﬁeld
in the outer edge of AR that turns to a more vertical direction, while the darkening
of sunspot structure near the central PIL is related to the magnetic ﬁeld that turns to
a more horizontal direction. Chen et al. (2007) statistically studied over 400 events
using TRACE white-light data and found that the signiﬁcance of sunspot structure
change is positively correlated with the magnitude of ﬂares. Using Hinode/SOT G-
band data, Wang et al. (2012a) further studied the intrinsic linkage of penumbral
decay to magnetic ﬁeld changes. They took advantage of the high spatio-temporal
resolution Hinode/SOT data and observed that in sections of peripheral penumbrae
swept by ﬂare ribbons, the dark ﬁbrils completely disappear while the bright grains
evolve into faculae where the magnetic ﬂux becomes even more vertical. These re-
sults again suggest that the component of horizontal magnetic ﬁeld of the penumbra
is straightened upward (i.e., turning from horizontal to vertical) due to magnetic ﬁeld
restructuring associated with ﬂares. Also notably, the ﬂare-related enhancement of
penumbral structure near central ﬂaring PILs has also been unambiguously observed
with BBSO/GST. Using GST TiO images with unprecedented spatial (0.1”) and tem-
poral (15 s) resolution, Wang et al. (2013) reported on a rapid formation of sunspot
penumbra at the PIL associated with the 2012 July 2 C7.4 ﬂare (see Fig. 54 and
the corresponding movie). The most striking observation is that the solar granulation
evolves to the typical pattern of penumbra consisting of alternating dark and bright
ﬁbrils. Interestingly, a new δ-sunspot is created by the appearance of such a penum-
bral feature, and this penumbral formation also corresponds to the enhancement of
the horizontal ﬁeld. Similar pattern of penumbral formation is shown by Wang et al.
(2018b).

A very clear demonstration of ﬂare related changes in vector magnetic ﬁelds came
from the analysis of SDO/HMI vector data by Wang et al. (2012b). The analysis of
the X2.2 ﬂare in AR NOAA 11158 on 2011 February 15 clearly demonstrated a
rapid/irreversible increase of the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld at the ﬂaring PIL. The
mean horizontal ﬁelds increased by about 500 G within 30 minutes after the ﬂare.
The authors also found that the photospheric ﬁeld near the ﬂaring PIL became more
sheared and more inclined towards horizontal, consistent with the earlier results (e.g.,
Wang 1992; Wang et al. 1994a; Liu et al. 2005). Following that initial study, a number
of papers using HMI data demonstrated the consistent changes of magnetic ﬁelds (Liu
et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012c; Petrie 2012, 2013; Yang et al. 2014;
Castellanos Dur´an et al. 2018). The found patterns of the changes are consistent in
the sense that the transverse ﬁeld enhances in a region across the central ﬂaring PIL.
Figure 55 shows the typical time proﬁles of such ﬁeld changes.

Associated with the above ﬁndings in the 2D photospheric magnetic ﬁelds, there
must be a corresponding magnetic ﬁeld evolution in 3D above the photosphere. The
NLFFF extrapolation works as a powerful tool to reconstruct the 3D magnetic topol-
ogy of the solar corona (see Sect. 4.3.1 for the extrapolation methods). Using Hin-
ode/SOT magnetic ﬁeld data, Jing et al. (2008) showed that the magnetic shear (in-
dicating non-potentiality) only increases at lower altitude while it still largely relaxes
in the higher corona, therefore the total free magnetic energy in 3D volume should
still decrease after energy release of a ﬂare. Using HMI data, Sun et al. (2012) clearly

showed that the electric current density indeed increases at the ﬂaring PIL near the
surface while it decreases higher up, which may explain the overall decrease of free
magnetic energy together with a local enhancement at low altitude (see Fig. 56). The
above results may also imply that magnetic ﬁelds collapse toward the surface. Such
a collapse was even detected in a C7.4 ﬂare on 2012 July 2 as reported by Jing et al.
(2014) and shown in Fig. 54. The collapse (or contraction) of magnetic arcades as re-
ﬂected by NLFFF models across the C7.4 ﬂare is spatially and temporally correlated
with the formation of sunspot penumbra on the surface (Wang et al. 2013), as ob-
served in high resolution observations of GST. The physics of this phenomenon is not
fully understood: this could be due to newly reconnected magnetic ﬁelds above the
PIL, or perhaps the reduction of local magnetic pressure due to a removal/weakening
of the magnetic ﬂux rope instigates the collapse.

Using vector magnetograms from HMI together with those from Hinode/SOT
with high polarization accuracy and spatial resolution, Liu et al. (2012) revealed sim-
ilar rapid and persistent increase of the transverse ﬁeld associated with the M6.6 ﬂare
on 2011 February 13, together with the collapse of coronal currents toward the surface
at the sigmoid core region. Liu et al. (2013) further compared the NLFFF extrapo-
lations before and after the event (see Fig. 57). The results provide direct evidence
of the tether-cutting reconnection model. There are four ﬂare footpoints. About 10%
of the ﬂux (∼ 3 × 1019 Mx) from the inner footpoints (e.g., FP2 and FP3 of loops
FP2–FP1 and FP3–FP4) undergoes a footpoint exchange to create shorter loops of
FP2–FP3. This result presents the rapid/irreversible changes of the transverse ﬁeld

and corresponding 3-D ﬁeld changes in corona. A more comprehensive investiga-
tion including the 3D magnetic ﬁeld restructuring and ﬂare energy release as well as
the helioseismic response of two homologous ﬂares, the 2011 September 6 X2.1 and
September 7 X1.8 ﬂares in AR NOAA 11283, was performed by Liu et al. (2014).
Their observational and modeling results depicted a coherent picture of coronal im-
plosions, in which the central ﬁeld collapses while the peripheral ﬁeld turns vertical,
consistent with what was found by Liu et al. (2005).

There are two research directions that are particularly worth mentioning here.

– Joint analysis of photospheric magnetic ﬁelds and coronal topology. Petrie (2016)
studied two X-class ﬂares observed by SDO and the Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory (STEREO; Kaiser et al. 2008). They found that the rapid changes of
magnetic ﬁelds at the PIL is associated with coronal loop contraction. G¨om¨ory
et al. (2017) analyzed VTT (Vacuum Tower Telescope) data covering an M-class
ﬂare and found an enhancement of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld of approximately
550 G. This transverse ﬁeld was found to bridge the PIL and connect umbrae of
opposite polarities in the δ-spot. At the same time, a newly formed system of
loops appeared co-spatially in the corona as seen in 171 ˚A passband images of
SDO/AIA. Therefore, the rapid photospheric magnetic ﬁeld evolution is a part of
3D magnetic ﬁeld re-structuring.

– Statistical study of a large number of events. Castellanos Dur´an et al. (2018) car-
ried out a statistical analysis of permanent LOS magnetic ﬁeld changes during
18 X-, 37 M-, 19 C-, and 1 B-class ﬂares using data from SDO/HMI. They in-
vestigated the properties of permanent changes, such as frequency, areas, and
locations. They detected changes of LOS ﬁeld in 59 out of 75 ﬂares and found
that the strong ﬂares are more likely to show changes. Figure 58 demonstrates the
correlation between the affected LOS ﬁeld change area and the peak GOES ﬂux.
It is apparent that larger ﬂare produces more prominent ﬁeld changes.

5.3 Sudden sunspot rotation and ﬂow ﬁeld changes

The evolution of magnetic ﬁelds is closely associated with photospheric ﬂow mo-
tions. Obviously, the studies of the ﬂow ﬁelds along with the magnetic ﬁeld evolution
is very important. Several methods of ﬂow tracking have been developed as sum-
marized and compared by Welsch et al. (2007). One particular method is the differ-
ential afﬁne velocity estimator (DAVE; Schuck 2005, 2006) that uses the induction
equation to derive ﬂow ﬁelds. A substantially improved version, DAVE for vector
magnetograms (DAVE4VM; Schuck 2008), derives not only the horizontal but also
the vertical component of the ﬂows, which thus can analyze the ﬂux emergence (i.e.,
vertical motions) in addition to the horizontal motions.

Wang et al. (2014) showed some initial results of the ﬂare-related acceleration
of sunspot rotation that is derived by DAVE using SDO/HMI observations of AR
NOAA 11158. The rotational speeds of the two sunspots increase signiﬁcantly dur-
ing and right after the X2.2 ﬂare. Moreover, the direction of the enhanced sunspot
rotation agrees with that of the change of the horizontal Lorentz force. Using the
estimated torque and moment of inertia, Wang et al. (2014) estimated the angular
acceleration of the sunspots. Although there are some uncertainties in the measure-

ments and assumptions, the values agree with the observed angular acceleration of
suddenly rotating sunspot immediately after the ﬂare.

Liu et al. (2016a) used GST data to analyze the ﬂow motions of the 2015 June 22
M6.6 ﬂare. It is particularly striking that the rotation is not uniform over the sunspot:
as the ﬂare ribbon sweeps across, its different portions accelerate (up to 50◦ hr−1) at
different times corresponding to peaks of the ﬂare hard X-ray emission. Associated
with the rotation, the intensity and magnetic ﬁeld of the sunspot change signiﬁcantly,
and the Poynting and helicity ﬂuxes temporarily reverse their signs, indicating that
the energy propagation that causes the rotation is from the higher atmosphere down
to the photosphere. Figure 59 demonstrates the key results of that study (see also the
corresponding movie).

Wang et al. (2018b) analyzed the same AR with GST and HMI data. For a penum-
bral segment in the negative ﬁeld adjacent to the PIL, an enhancement of penumbral
ﬂows (up to an unusually high value of 2 km s−1) and extension of penumbral ﬁb-
rils after the ﬁrst peak of the ﬂare hard X-ray emission. They also found an area at
the PIL, which is co-spatial with a precursor brightening kernel, that exhibits a grad-

ual increase of shear ﬂow velocity (up to 0.9 km s−1) after the ﬂare. The enhancing
penumbral and shear ﬂow regions are also accompanied by an increase of horizontal
ﬁeld and decrease of magnetic inclination angle measured from the horizontal. These
results further conﬁrm the concept of back reaction of coronal restructuring on the
photosphere as a result of ﬂare energy release. Figure 60 shows the evolution of the
ﬂow ﬁelds covering the ﬂare.

5.4 Theoretical interpretations

The modeling efforts of ARs and related eruptions are summarized in Sect. 4. Here
we review certain points in explaining magnetic ﬁeld restructuring following ﬂares.
Longcope and Forbes (2014) reviewed solar eruption models and classiﬁed them into
three categories, tether-cutting, break-out and loss-of-equilibrium, all of which can be
catastrophic. The tether-cutting model assumes a two-step reconnection that leads to
eruption in the form of ﬂares and CMEs, in particular, for sigmoid ARs (e.g., Moore

Flare-productive active regions

91

and Labonte 1980; Moore et al. 2001; Moore and Sterling 2006). The ﬁrst-stage re-
connection occurs near the solar surface at the onset of the eruption and produces a
low-lying shorter loop across the PIL and thus explains the observed enhancement
of transverse ﬁelds after ﬂare. It also produces a much longer twisted ﬂux rope con-
necting the two far ends of a sigmoid that triggers the second stage of eruption: the
twisted ﬂux rope becomes unstable and erupts outward to form a full CME.

It is possible that in the earlier phase of the eruption, contraction of the shorter
ﬂare loop occurs. This has received increasing attention recently (e.g., Ji et al. 2006)
and possibly corresponds to the ﬁrst stage of the tether cutting. The ribbon separation
described in the standard ﬂare models such as the CSHKP model (Sect. 2.2) man-
ifests the second stage. This model may explain other observational ﬁndings such
as (1) transverse magnetic ﬁeld at ﬂaring PILs increases rapidly/persistently imme-
diately following the ﬂares (Wang et al. 2002b, 2004b; Wang and Liu 2010); (2)
penumbral decay occurs in the peripheral penumbral areas of δ-spots, indicating that
the magnetic ﬁeld lines turn more vertical after a ﬂare in these areas (Wang et al.
2004a; Liu et al. 2005); and (3) hard X-ray images of the Reuven Ramaty High En-
ergy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI; Lin et al. 2002) show four footpoints,
two inner ones and two outer ones, and sometimes the hard X-ray emitting sources
change from conﬁned footpoint structure to an elongated ribbon-like structure after
the ﬂare reaches intensity maximum (Liu et al. 2007a,b).

In an attempt to quantitatively compare observations and modeling, Li et al.
(2011) compared idealized MHD simulation of emerging ﬂux in ﬂare triggering with
observation. They selected a lower level in the simulation to examine the near-surface
magnetic structure evolution. Changes of magnetic ﬁeld orientation and strength in
the photosphere after ﬂares/CMEs are indeed found in the simulation. The most ob-
vious match is at the ﬂaring PIL, where ﬁeld lines in the simulation are found to be
more inclined towards the horizontal, and transverse ﬁeld strength increased after the
eruption. At the outer side of the simulated sunspot penumbral area, ﬁeld lines turn
to a more vertical direction with a decreased transverse ﬁeld strength. These are con-
sistent with the observed penumbral enhancement at the PIL and decay of peripheral
penumbrae (Liu et al. 2005). The simulation also shows the downward net Lorentz
force pressing onto the photosphere, conﬁrming the related observations.

Recently, Inoue et al. (2018a) performed an MHD simulation that takes into ac-
count the observed photospheric magnetic ﬁeld to reveal the dynamics of a solar
eruption in a realistic magnetic environment. In this simulation, they conﬁrmed that
the tether-cutting reconnection occurring locally above the PIL creates a twisted ﬂux
tube, which is lifted into a toroidal unstable area where it loses equilibrium, destroys
the force-free state, and drives the eruption. Figure 61 shows that the simulation not
only reproduces the ﬂare ribbons well but also demonstrates the irreversible trans-
verse ﬁeld enhancement at the photospheric PIL. Although the authors did not em-
phasize this point, the peripheral penumbral decay is also apparent in the simulated
data. The same event has been analyzed in detail observationally by Liu et al. (2012,
2013). Note that Inoue et al. (2015) demonstrated similar ﬁeld changes for the X2.2
ﬂare in the same AR. The rapid ﬁeld change coincides with the onset of the ﬂare.

As we mentioned earlier, Hudson et al. (2008) and Fisher et al. (2012) intro-
duced the back reaction concept. The authors made the prediction that after ﬂares,

at the ﬂaring PIL, the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds become more horizontal. The
analysis is based on the simple principle of energy and momentum conservation: the
upward erupting momentum must be compensated by the downward momentum as
the back reaction. In addition, the ﬁeld change should be stepwise (i.e. permanent)
because it results from the removal of magnetic energy and magnetic pressure from
the corona. This is one of the few models that speciﬁcally predict the rapid and per-
manent changes of photospheric magnetic ﬁelds associated with ﬂares and support
the observed Lorentz force change (e.g., Wang et al. 2012b,c; Liu et al. 2012; Sun
et al. 2012; Petrie 2013, 2014, 2019).

As a more recent study, Wang et al. (2018c) analyzed four ﬂare events using
SDO/AIA and STEREO and demonstrated the existence of real contractions of loops.
They identiﬁed two categories of implosion, which are (1) a rapid contraction at the
beginning of the ﬂare impulsive phase, as magnetic free energy is removed rapidly
by a ﬁlament eruption; and (2) a continuous loop shrinkage during the entire ﬂare
impulsive phase that corresponds to ongoing conversion of magnetic free energy in a
coronal volume.

Finally, in Aulanier (2016), the sudden sunspot rotation is somehow demonstrated
in their simulation (see Fig. 62). Note that these simulations usually assume the line-
tying condition, i.e., the footpoint motions are not allowed (see Sect. 4.2 for details).
Nevertheless, the observed trend slightly above the photosphere can demonstrate the
direction for the rotational force, although quantitative comparison is very difﬁcult.

6 Summary

How close have we reached to the complete picture of the formation and evolution
of ﬂare-producing ARs? Thanks to the advancement of observation techniques and

94

Shin Toriumi, Haimin Wang

modeling efforts, we have acquired a substantial amount of knowledge that may set
the grounds for a more complete understanding. In this section, we summarize our
current understanding of the genesis and evolution and key observational features of
these ARs.

6.1 The era with Hinode, SDO, and GST

To a greater degree, our understanding of the ﬂaring ARs has been pushed forward
by the ceaseless improvement of observation instruments, and the progress in the last
decade has been made in particular by Hinode, SDO, and GST. In fact, many parts of
this review article are based on the outcome of these missions.

Since launch in September 2006, the Hinode spacecraft has sent us various im-
portant observables. By virtue of seeing-free condition from space, one of its trio of
instruments, SOT, has acquired high-resolution vector magnetograms, revealed the
detailed structure of ﬂaring PILs, and showed us its importance in triggering ﬂares
and CMEs (Sect. 3.2.1). With the vector magnetograms, though not quite satisfacto-
rily, now we can extrapolate the coronal ﬁeld by the NLFFF techniques, which is used
as the initial condition of data-constrained simulations (Sect. 4.3). Moreover, through
simultaneous multi-wavelength observation in concert with XRT and EIS, Hinode
realized even more comprehensive tracing of the dynamical evolution over the differ-
ent atmospheric layers. The ﬂux rope formation due to the photospheric shear motion
and the non-thermal broadening of EUV lines in response to the helicity injection
are good examples of Hinode’s multi-wavelength probing of ﬂare-producing ARs
(Sects. 3.3.1 and 3.3.2).

Everyday, tons of observational data are ceaselessly poured to the ground from
SDO (launched in February 2010). They include photospheric intensitygram, Dopp-
lergram, (vector) magnetogram, and (E)UV images. Its constant full-disk observa-
tion enables us to statistically investigate the evolution of ARs from appearance to
eventual ﬂare eruption with unprecedented details. Together with EIS and XRT, the
multi-ﬁlter (multi-temperature) observation of AIA provided the thermal diagnostics
of ARs such as DEM inversions (Sect. 3.3.1). The steady supply of vector magne-
togram by HMI revealed the rapid changes of not only the LOS ﬁeld but also the
transverse ﬁeld in time scales of down to ∼ 10 minutes (Sect. 5.2). Several new
attempts to utilize vector data have started. For instance, the series of vector mag-
netograms are used in data-driven simulations to sequentially update the boundary
condition of coronal ﬁeld models (Sect. 4.3.3). Various photospheric parameters cal-
culated from the vector data are used for predicting the ﬂares and CMEs (see discus-
sion in Sect. 7.2.1).

Thanks to the high spatial resolution with the 1.6-m aperture and the longer duty
cycle, BBSO/GST (scientiﬁc observation initiated in January 2009) has played a key
role in obtaining insights into the rapid changes of photospheric (high-β) ﬁelds in
response to dynamical evolution of coronal (low-β) ﬁelds during the course of ﬂares
and CMEs (Sect. 5). The most important science outputs made by BBSO/GST related
to the ﬂare-AR science include (1) the detailed structure, development, and destabi-
lization of a ﬂux rope, (2) the sudden ﬂare-induced rotation of sunspots and evolution

Flare-productive active regions

95

of photospheric ﬂow ﬁelds, and (3) the tiny and transient ﬂare precursors in the lower
atmosphere. Through these discoveries, now we know that the answer to the “tail
wags the dog” problem, i.e., whether the coronal eruption can cause changes in the
photospheric ﬁeld, is yes.

The advancement of instruments has also motivated the development of numer-
ical modeling. For instance, the long-term monitoring of ﬂare-productive ARs by
Hinode and SDO from birth to eruption inspired the ﬂux emergence models and gave
a clue to the formation mechanisms of δ-spots (e.g., NOAA 11158 in February 2011:
Sect. 4.1.2). Fine-scale ﬂare-triggering ﬁelds and rapid magnetic changes during the
ﬂares, which are observable only with advanced instruments, have been compared
with the results of the ﬂare simulations (Sects. 4.2 and 5.4). Filtergram images of var-
ious wavelengths by XRT and AIA provide the means to diagnose the coronal ﬁelds
(e.g., XRT image and NLFFF extrapolation of sigmoids: Sect. 3.3.1). All of these
results underscore the importance of direct comparison of observation and modeling
in unraveling the formation and evolution of ﬂare-producing ARs.

6.2 From birth to eruption

In this subsection, we summarize some of the key aspects related to the genesis of
ﬂare-producing ARs and eventual energy release, which have been uncovered by the
observational and theoretical studies presented in this review article.

(1) Subsurface evolution: The dynamo-generated toroidal ﬂux loops start rising
in the convection zone (Sect. 2.1). Subject to the background turbulent convection,
some of them may lose a simple Ω-shape and deform into a helical structure, a top-
dent conﬁguration, bifurcated multiple branches, or collide with other ﬂux systems
(Sect. 4.1). Through these processes, the rising ﬂux systems gain non-potentiality that
is represented by free magnetic energy and magnetic helicity.

(2) Formation of δ-spots: On their appearance in the photosphere, some of these
rising ﬂux loops form δ-sunspots, in which umbrae of positive and negative polar-
ities are so close to share a common penumbra (Sect. 2.3). Most of the δ-spots are
generated by multiple emerging loops rather than a single Ω-loop and the diversity of
polarity layout stems from the difference in the subsurface history, but strong ﬂares
also emanate from non-δ sunspots such as the Inter-AR case (Sect. 3.1).

(3) Development of ﬂaring PIL and photospheric features: Due to shearing and
converging motion, the PIL between the opposite polarities obtains a strong trans-
verse ﬁeld with high gradient and shear (Sect. 3.2). This is the outcome of the Lorentz
force, and this force also causes the rotational motion of sunspots (Sect. 4.1).

(4) Formation of ﬂux rope: The coronal ﬁelds lying above the PIL become sheared
in sync with the photospheric driving, cancel against each other, and form a magnetic
ﬂux rope. This helical structure is observed as a sigmoid in soft X-rays and as a
ﬁlament (prominence) in Hα (Sects. 3.3 and 4.2).

(5) Flare occurrence and CME eruption: When the energy is sufﬁciently accu-
mulated, the solar ﬂare is eventually initiated (Sect. 2.2). The ﬂux rope becomes
destabilized and erupts, often as a CME into the interplanetary space, leaving behind
a variety of remarkable observational features on the Sun. The drastic evolution of

coronal ﬁelds causes rapid and profound changes in magnetic and ﬂow ﬁelds even in
the photosphere (Sect. 5). If the conﬁnement of the overlying arcade in an AR is too
strong, however, the ﬂux rope may not develop into a CME.

As is obvious from the fact that helical structures are seen in many parts in the
story above, the whole process of AR formation, ﬂare eruption, and CME propagation
appears to be, overall, the large-scale transport of magnetic helicity and energy from
the solar interior all the way to outer space (Low 1996, 2002; D´emoulin 2007). In
this sense, the formation of δ-spots, where abundant evidence of non-potentiality is
observed, is accepted as a natural consequence of the helicity that is delivered from
the interior.

6.3 Key observational features and quantities

In the long history of observation of ARs producing strong ﬂares and CMEs, various
features have been investigated. Perhaps these features can be summarized into three
important factors, which are (a) the size, (b) complexity, and (c) evolution. Given
the large magnetic energy accumulated in the ARs, it is reasonable that these ARs are
larger in spot area, or naturally in total magnetic ﬂux. However, as we saw in Sect. 2.2,
the largest spot in history, RGO 14886, was not ﬂare active, probably because this
AR had a simple bipolar (i.e., potential) magnetic ﬁeld. To increase free magnetic en-
ergy that is released through ﬂare eruptions, ARs need to contain morphological and
magnetic complexity, which is manifested as the dispersed polarities (i.e., γ-spots),
strong-ﬁeld, strong-gradient, highly-sheared PILs in δ-spots, magnetic tongues, ﬂux
ropes, sigmoids, etc. These complex structures manifest during the course of AR evo-
lution, observed as ﬂux emergence of various scales, shearing motion on both sides of
a PIL, and rotational motion of the sunspots. Of course, such evolutionary processes
may serve as a trigger of eventual ﬂare eruption.

As we have seen in many parts in this review, there is a multitude of statistical
investigations that reveal the quantitative differences between ﬂaring and quiescent
ARs. In Table 1, we pick up several parameters from the literature that are suggested
to differentiate (and may subsequently predict) X-class ﬂares.

One may notice from this table and other references in this article that many of
the variables that have been investigated so far are snapshot parameters, i.e., those

Flare-productive active regions

97

derived from observation at a single moment. However, since it is the AR evolution
that drives the ﬂaring activities, we need to understand the importance of dynamic
parameters, i.e., those that describe the temporal change of magnetic ﬁelds. One of
the most striking examples is the very fast ﬂux emergence in the super-ﬂaring AR
NOAA 12673 (Fig. 31). Sun and Norton (2017) showed that the ﬂux growth rate
(i.e., time derivative of unsigned total magnetic ﬂux) in this AR was greater than any
values reported in the literature, and its X9.3 ﬂare occurred a couple of days after
this remarkable emergence was detected. Therefore, such time derivative quantities
might be key to predict ﬂares and CMEs (Sect. 7.2.1; see also Leka and Barnes 2003,
2007).

7 Discussion

Despite the remarkable progress made to date, many outstanding questions remain.
However, some of them will be answered if observational and numerical techniques
are improved more in the near future. In this section, we list some of the important
questions and discuss the possibilities to utilize our knowledge of ﬂare-productive
ARs in related science ﬁelds.

7.1 Outstanding questions and future perspective

Observationally, we still do not have a “visual” image of the subsurface emerging ﬂux
and thus we cannot establish whether the complex 3D conﬁguration of ﬂaring ARs
deduced from the surface evolution is real or not. In a statistical sense, on average,
these ARs show enhanced vorticity before they cause ﬂare eruptions (Sect. 3.3.3).
However, we still do not have robust methods of imaging the rising ﬂux because the
(local) helioseismic probing is hampered by the fast emergence and the low signal-
to-noise ratio. The existence of strong ﬂux may not be treated as a small perturbation,
which is assumed when solving the linear inverse problem in seismology. Advance-
ment in helioseismology techniques, probably with the support of numerical model-
ing, is desired to overcome this difﬁculty.

Turbulent convection plays a crucial role in producing the morphological and
magnetic complexity of these ARs. The generation of Ω-loops from the magnetic
wreath in the global anelastic simulations begins to establish the concept of the “spot-
dynamo” (Fig. 2: see Nelson et al. 2013; Brun et al. 2015). However, due to the lim-
itation of the anelastic approximation, it is difﬁcult to trace the story after the ﬂux
loops pass through the uppermost convection zone (about −20 Mm and upward).
Compressible simulations that enable access to (very close to) the solar surface, such
as by Hotta et al. (2014), may reveal the dynamical interaction between the magnetic
ﬁeld and turbulent convection in much greater detail. The genesis of magnetic helic-
ity, namely, the twist and writhe of emerging ﬂux (observed in the form of magnetic
shear, spot rotations, magnetic tongues, sigmoids, etc.: Sect. 3), is still a big mystery
(Longcope et al. 1999). Regarding the formation of ﬂaring ARs, it is also an inter-
esting question how and why super strong transverse ﬁeld appears at the PIL in a

98

Shin Toriumi, Haimin Wang

δ-spot instead of at the core of sunspot umbra. These issues may be solved by an
advancement of numerical models.

There has been a dichotomy of theory whether a magnetic ﬂux rope is created
well before the eruption or at the very moment of it (see, e.g., Forbes et al. 2006,
p. 266). Thanks to the NLFFF, data-constrained, and data-driven models, now the
ﬂux rope appears to be created from before eruption, at least in the ﬂare-productive
ARs, through the continued shearing along the PIL. These numerical methods may be
advanced even more and provide a conclusive answer. For example, vector ﬁeld mea-
surements in higher atmospheric layers may realize more accurate extrapolations.
In the current force-free methods, it is assumed that the input photospheric vector
ﬁeld is in force-free (Sect. 4.3.1). However, this is apparently not the case because
the photosphere is in the realm of high-β plasma (i.e., the photospheric plasma is
largely affected by the non-magnetic forces such as pressure gradient), which re-
quires a smoothing of the photospheric vector ﬁeld before the extrapolation is ap-
plied. Chromospheric low-β ﬁelds, obtained by future instruments such as the Daniel
K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), may give better boundary conditions for the
force-free extrapolations, data-constrained and data-driven models. Moreover, mag-
netic information at multiple altitudes allows us to calculate the partial derivatives in
the vertical direction (i.e., ∂Bx/∂z and ∂By/∂z) and may provide better estimates of
the total (vector) current density, horizontal velocity, electric ﬁeld, and Lorentz force
density.

Stereoscopic monitoring of the Sun from multiple vantage points, for instance by
spacecrafts around the Earth and at the Lagrangian L5 point or by off-ecliptic ex-
plorers like Solar Orbiter, is helpful in various aspects (Akioka et al. 2005; Schrijver
et al. 2015; Gibson et al. 2018). Apart from the early warning of space weather events
like Earth-directed CMEs and violent ARs beyond the east limb, it may help probing
the deeper interior with local helioseismology, resolving the ambiguity of magnetic
measurements, and assessing the topology of entangled coronal ﬁelds (see results
from STEREO). With advanced spectroscopic and imaging instruments, atmospheric
evolution such as build-up and eruption of ﬂux ropes and non-thermal broadening of
EUV lines (Sect. 3.3) may be revealed in further detail. All these new capabilities
will greatly improve our understanding of the nature of ﬂare-productive ARs.

The detection of ﬂare-related activities from ground-based large-aperture tele-
scopes has been, in most cases, done by GST (Sect. 5). To better understand the
ﬁne-scale dynamics in AR build-up and ﬂare eruption, it is necessary to increase the
detection rate of these events by enhancing the observing time. One possible idea is
to organize an international network of high-resolution telescopes, such as DKIST
(4-m aperture in Maui), New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST; 1-m aperture in Yun-
nan), Swedish Solar Telescope (SST; 1-m aperture in La Palma), GREGOR (1.5-m
aperture in Tenerife), and European Solar Telescope (EST; 4-m aperture under con-
templation), and conduct a long-running monitoring of a target AR. Several key ob-
servations of dynamic activities in ﬂaring ARs were already made with NVST (Xue
et al. 2016, 2017) and SST (Guglielmino et al. 2016; Robustini et al. 2018). There-
fore, the combination of these stations may open up unexplored discovery space and
provide insights into the evolution of small-scale magnetic features in the very long
run (days to weeks).

7.2 Broader impacts on related science ﬁelds

7.2.1 Prediction and forecasting of solar ﬂares and CMEs

Probably one of the most practical applications of the knowledge of ﬂaring ARs
we have acquired is the prediction of ﬂares and CMEs. Statistical investigations of
various events that introduce parameters such as those in Table 1 characterized the
ﬂare-productive ARs. In the last decades, the knowledge-based ﬂare predictions using
these quantities have been signiﬁcantly developed.

Nowadays, these methods employ machine-learning algorithms. For example,
Bobra and Couvidat (2015) extracted various photospheric parameters from the SDO/HMI
vector magnetograms for individual ARs, trained the machine, and obtained a good
predictive performance for ≥M1.0 ﬂares. The parameters investigated are listed in
Table 2, which are basically the previously suggested variables (Leka and Barnes
2003; Fisher et al. 2012; Schrijver 2007), It should be noted that most of them are
“extensive,” where a given parameter increases with AR size (Tan et al. 2007; Welsch
et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2015; Toriumi and Takasao 2017).

Many of the parameters listed in Table 2 are, again, snapshot ones (see Sect. 6.3),
and the inclusion of dynamic parameters may be helpful in ﬂare predictions (Leka
and Barnes 2003, 2007). For instance, to the ﬂare-predictive parameters in Table 2,
Nishizuka et al. (2017) added additional information that indicates ﬂare history and
chromospheric pre-ﬂare brightening and also time derivatives of various observables.
By training the machine with three different algorithms, the authors successfully ob-
tained a prediction score higher than that of Bobra and Couvidat (2015). This study
clearly highlights the usage of dynamic parameters.

However, it is worth noting that increasing the number of parameters does not
necessarily improve the prediction performance. In fact, Leka and Barnes (2007) and
Bobra and Couvidat (2015) found that there was little value to add parameters more
than a few. This is because the model with many parameters (i.e. large degrees of

100

Shin Toriumi, Haimin Wang

freedom) tends to overﬁt the training data and, in that case, the model may perform
worse on the validation data.

Today, while there remains a view that the occurrence of ﬂares is a “stochas-
tic” process (e.g., the avalanche model by Lu and Hamilton 1991) and therefore the
“deterministic” forecasting might be fundamentally impossible (Schrijver 2009), the
knowledge-based prediction is growing much more rapidly than ever before (e.g.,
Qahwaji and Colak 2007; Colak and Qahwaji 2009; Yu et al. 2010; Ahmed et al.
2013; Muranushi et al. 2015; Bobra and Ilonidis 2016; Liu et al. 2017a; Jonas et al.
2018; Huang et al. 2018; Nishizuka et al. 2018). Together with the attempts to build
up physics-based (i.e., modeling-based) algorithms (Sects. 4.3.2 and 4.3.3), the re-
cent development of this ﬁeld may tell us that the real-time space weather forecasting
will come true in the very near future.

7.2.2 Investigating extreme space-weather events in history

The strongest ﬂare activity ever observed with an estimated GOES class of ∼X45
is the Carrington ﬂare in September 1859 (see Sect. 2.2). To understand the mech-
anisms and trends of such extreme space weather events that may affect the Earth
(like the occurrence frequency; Schrijver et al. 2012; Riley 2012; Curto et al. 2016),
it is crucial to increase the sample number by surveying the greatest events in history.
However, often these events do not have observations of sufﬁcient data quality for
scientiﬁc analysis. In the modern age, the data analyzed are often digitized intensity
images of various wavelengths and LOS or vector magnetograms. For the historical
events, however, available records can be photographic plates or perhaps only sunspot
drawings. But still, there are several ways to elucidate how and why the strong events
occurred.

For instance, there are several attempts to achieve magnetic information from
historical sunspot drawings. For the great storm of May 1921 (Silverman and Cliver
2001; Kappenman 2006), Lundstedt et al. (2015) reconstructed “magnetograms” by
applying their torus model to the daily Mount Wilson drawings of sunspot magnetic
ﬁelds and studied the development of the target AR. They found that spot rotations
and ﬂux emergence occurred in the AR. They pointed out the close association be-
tween the drastic spot evolutions and the eventual magnetic storm.

Another approach is to reconstruct vector magnetogram from existing LOS mag-
netogram by applying one of the machine-learning methods called transfer learning
(Pan and Qiang 2010). One of the purposes of this method is to convert some source
data to target data and, with this method, one may use SDO/HMI vector magne-
tograms (for Cycle 24) and SOHO/MDI LOS magnetograms (for Cycle 23) as the
source data and target data, respectively, and reproduce “vector magnetograms” for
ARs of Cycle 23. Because there were many more stronger ﬂares in Cycle 23, such
vector data may help investigate the driving mechanisms of extreme events.

In many respects, studying historical records is beneﬁcial in understanding the ac-
tivity of the Sun. It may tell us how strong events the Sun can produce, how frequently
these events occur, and how they make an impact on our magnetic circumstances. Al-
though it is not easy to derive useful information from such records, we can still take
advantage of the current knowledge of ﬂaring ARs. Attempts to examine drastic spot

Flare-productive active regions

101

evolution and reconstruct magnetograms may give us clues to understand the nature
of severe space-weather events.

7.2.3 Connection with stellar ﬂares and CMEs

The production of stellar ﬂares and CMEs are now of great importance, not only
from the viewpoint of mass and angular momentum loss rates especially of the active
young stars (e.g., Aarnio et al. 2012), but also in the search for habitability of orbit-
ing exoplanets. The type II radio burst, which is believed to be produced by MHD
shocks in front of the CME propagating into the interplanetary space (Gurnett 1995),
is currently the best way of detecting the stellar CMEs (Osten and Wolk 2017).

In this regard, Crosley and Osten (2018a,b) attempted to detect type II bursts
on nearby, magnetically-active, well-characterized M dwarf star EQ Peg. During 20
hours of simultaneous radio and optical observation, they detected four optical ﬂare
signatures but no radio features identiﬁable as type II bursts. Two radio bursts were
found during the additional 44 hours of radio-only observation. However, their char-
acteristics were not consistent with that of type II events. From the statistics of the
solar ﬂares and CMEs (Yashiro et al. 2006), all the four detected ﬂares are empiri-
cally predicted to have associated CMEs, but none was detected at radio wavelengths
in this data set.

As an independent analysis, Leitzinger et al. (2014) searched for ﬂares and CMEs
on 28 young late-type (K to M) stars in the open cluster Blanco-1. From the ﬁve hour
observation, they found four Hα ﬂares from three M stars and one K star. Interest-
ingly, however, they also did not detect any clear indications of CMEs such as spectral
asymmetries of the Hα line caused by large Doppler velocities.

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the signals were less than the
detection sensitivity, it is worth discussing the reason of the “failed” eruptions by em-
ploying the knowledge of ﬂare-productive ARs of the Sun. As we saw, for instance, in
Sects. 2.2 and 4.1.5, the ﬂare eruption tends to fail when the overlying coronal loops
are strong and slowly decaying over height (Wang et al. 2017a; Vasantharaju et al.
2018; Jing et al. 2018). Observations and numerical modeling of ﬂaring ARs show
that, for the failed events, a magnetic ﬂux rope is often trapped in the AR core and
does not have an access to open ﬁelds (Toriumi et al. 2017b; Toriumi and Takasao
2017; DeRosa and Barnes 2018). As the Zeeman Doppler Imaging by Morin et al.
(2008) suggests, active M dwarfs tend to be covered by strong magnetic patches over
the entire stellar surface. Due to the strong conﬁnement by coronal loops extending
from these patches, we may expect less successful CME eruptions even if energetic
stellar ﬂares occur (Drake et al. 2016). The conﬁnement may also be due to the strong
large-scale dipolar ﬁeld, as numerically modeled by Alvarado-G´omez et al. (2018).

Thanks to the advancement of observational capabilities, many more “super-
ﬂares” are now detected on solar-like G-type stars (Maehara et al. 2012; Shibayama
et al. 2013). Indications of huge starspots with large magnetic energy are seen in
these stars (e.g., Notsu et al. 2013). By conducting spectroscopic and polarimetric
observations on the properties of superﬂares and starspots, and by comparing them
with numerical models of solar-stellar ﬂares and ARs, the production mechanisms,

102

similarities and diversities, and their stellar space-weather impacts may be revealed
in detail in the near future.

A Appendix: Original advocates of the kink instability

Little has been known about who ﬁrst proposed the helical kink instability as the
formation mechanism for the δ-spots. Almost certainly, it is Linton et al. (1996)
who for the ﬁrst time investigated this instability in the context of δ-spot formation.
However, the authors did not clearly claim in their paper that they were the ﬁrst to
propose this idea. Before that, from the observed proper motions of δ-spots, Tanaka
(1991) suggested in his posthumous publication that the rising of a knotted twisted
ﬂux tube creates the δ-spots (twisted knot model). Although his illustration, adopted
as Fig. 15(a) in this review, is highly evocative of the kink instability, the term “kink
instability” was not used at all in his paper. It is now almost impossible to ﬁnd out
whether Katsuo Tanaka and his longtime collaborator Harold Zirin held an idea of
the kink instability at that time because both of them are deceased. Here we show
a brief history between Tanaka (1991) and Linton et al. (1996), which George H.
Fisher, Mark G. Linton, and Yuhong Fan gave to us.

While Fisher was working on the thin ﬂux tube model (Sect. 2.1.1) with Fan in the
University of Hawaii, he conceived an idea to add magnetic twist to the thin ﬂux tube,
inspired by Mouschovias and Poland (1978), who proposed magnetic twist as a driver
of the ﬂux rope eruption. Although the concept of Mouschovias and Poland (1978)
was based more on the lateral kink instability, in which the displacement of a twisted
ﬂux tube is in a single perpendicular direction (i.e., an Ω-loop in a 2D plane), Fisher
had the misconception that the driving mechanism was the helical kink mode, where
the direction of the displacement rotates along the tube axis (see Priest 2014, Sect.
7.5.3 for the two modes). When Fisher and Linton started working on this issue after
Fisher moved to the University of California, Berkeley in 1992, Dana W. Longcope
showed that the thin ﬂux tube model cannot represent the helical kink instability

Flare-productive active regions

103

because this model, in principle, assumes that any physical value is uniform over the
tube’s cross section and thus does not include internal motion within the tube.

In the meantime, they studied the textbook of Zirin (1988), especially on the
“island δ” sunspot,10 as well as the seminal work by Tanaka (1991). These two pub-
lications stimulated them to propose the helical kink instability as the origin for the
island δ-spot. Over 1994 and 1995, Linton performed energy principle analysis on the
instability with Longcope and, eventually, the work resulted in Linton et al. (1996).
Moreover, the presentation by Linton et al., probably in the 26th AAS/SPD meeting
in 1995, evolved into a collaboration with Russell B. Dahlburg on MHD simulations,
which was published later as Linton et al. (1998).

Therefore, it is not easy to narrow down the originator of the idea to one. However,
the above story should be a good example of a coincidental misconception serendip-
itously producing fruit.
