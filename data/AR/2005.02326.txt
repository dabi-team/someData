Abstract On September 10 2017, a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) erupted from the active

region (AR) 12673, leading to a ground level enhancement (GLE) event at Earth. Using

the 2D improved Particle Acceleration and Transport in the Heliosphere (iPATH) model, we

model the large solar energetic particle (SEP) event of 10 September 2017 observed at Earth,

Mars and STEREO-A. Based on observational evidence,we assume that the CME-driven

shock experienced a large lateral expansion shortly after the eruption, which is modelled by a

double Gaussian velocity proﬁle in this simulation. We use the in-situ shock arrival times and

the observed CME speeds at multiple spacecraft near Earth and Mars as constraints to adjust

the input model parameters. The modelled time intensity proﬁles and ﬂuence for energetic

protons are then compared with observations. Reasonable agreements with observations at

Mars and STEREO-A are found. The simulated results at Earth differ from observations

of GOES-15. Instead, the simulated results at a heliocentric longitude 20◦ west to Earth ﬁt

reasonably well with the GOES observation. This can be explained if the pre-event solar wind

magnetic ﬁeld at Earth is not described by a nominal Parker ﬁeld. Our results suggest that a

large lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock and a distorted interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld

due to previous events can be important in understanding this GLE event.

1 INTRODUCTION

Solar energetic particle events are historically classiﬁed into two broad categories: impulsive and gradual

events (Cane et al. 1986; Reames 1995, 1999). In this paradigm, impulsive SEPs are accelerated at solar

ﬂares and propagate along the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld to Earth with a rapid rise and decay phase in

the particle time intensity proﬁles. In comparison, gradual SEPs are accelerated via the diffusive shock

acceleration mechanism at CME-driven shocks. Because shocks are of large scale and last much longer

than ﬂares, these events are characterized by a prolonged intensity proﬁle and often higher ﬂuences than

impulsive events. Large gradual SEP events are of particular concern because the accompanying high-

energy protons pose the most serious radiation threats to astronauts living beyond low-Earth orbit and can

damage electronics on satellites in the space (Desai & Giacalone 2016). In some largest events, accelerated

particles can reach energies up to several GeV, leading to signiﬁcant increases in particle count rates through

neutron monitors at the Earth’s surface and are known as Ground Level Enhancements. Large SEP events are

usually associated with fast shocks and high ambient energetic particle intensity (referred as seed particles)

prior to the shock (Kahler 1996; Kahler et al. 2000). The increasing abundance of the seed particles is

possibly from preceding ﬂares (Mason et al. 2019) or preceding CMEs (Gopalswamy et al. 2004; Li &

Zank 2005). Li et al. (2012) proposed a twin-CME scenario for GLE events in which two CMEs erupt from

same or near active region within a period of 9 hours. The preceding CME and its driven shock disturbs

the coronal and interplanetary environment and leads to enhanced turbulence level which facilitates a more

efﬁcient acceleration at the second CME-driven shock. The scenario was later extended to large SEP events

(Ding et al. 2013).

The most recent GLE event occurred on September 10 2017, classiﬁed as GLE 72 (Mishev et al.

2018). A X8.2 class solar ﬂare erupted around 15:35 UT from AR 12673 at S09W88, followed by a wide

and very fast Coronal Mass Ejection. The eruption was well observed by multiple spacecraft at different

longitudes, provided a stereo view of this extreme case. The halo CME was ﬁrst observed by the Solar and

Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) at 16:00 UT,

with a reported linear speed of ∼3136 km/s from the CDAW catalog. Before this extreme eruption, there

were multiple preceding eruptions between 4 September and 9 September and the eruption directions varied

from the longitude of 4◦ to 105◦ (Luhmann et al. 2018). However, this event would not be classiﬁed as a

”twin-CME” (Li et al. 2012), because the closest preceding CME erupted on 23:12 UT on 9 September

2017, ∼17 hours before the main eruption, exceeding the time interval threshold of 13 hours (Ding et al.

2014) as a twin-CME. The global EUV waves (Hu et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2018), signatures of a ﬂux rope

and a long current sheet (Seaton & Darnel 2018; Warren et al. 2018; Yan et al. 2018) were observed

by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Liu et al.

(2019) studied the geometry and kinematics of

the CME-driven shock. They argued that the close shock arrival times at Earth and Mars is a result of

large lateral expansion of the shock early in the eruption. They suggested that a large lateral expansion of

the shock can affect particle acceleration and consequently the observations at different longitudes. Large

lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock for large CME eruptions have been investigated previously.

Gopalswamy et al.

(2012) examined the white-light CME evolution and noted a rapid and large lateral

expansion of the CME erupted on 2010 June 13. Kwon et al.

(2015) noted the apparent width of halo

CMEs as seen from multiple spacecraft was related to the expanding shock with a 360◦ envelope. Recent

works (e.g. Liu et al. 2017, 2019; Zhu et al. 2018) have suggested that lateral expansions of shock occur

frequently in large big eruptions. However, the effects of lateral expansion on solar energetic particles have

not been considered before. In this work, we will examine this problem.

Energetic particles associated with this fast CME were observed at Earth and Mars as well as Solar

Terrestrial Relations Observatory A (STEREO-A). GLE was observed by several neutron monitors stations

at about 16:15 UT on 10 September 2017 (Guo et al. 2018; Mishev et al. 2018). The different energy

channels from the instruments on board Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 15 (GOES-15)

show an intensive and long-lasting enhancement of energetic particles intensity (Bruno et al. 2019; Guo et

al. 2018). This event observed at Earth has a soft spectrum at high energies compared with most of GLE

events in the solar cycle 23 (Bruno et al. 2019; Cohen & Mewaldt 2018; Gopalswamy et al. 2018). On 10

September at around 19:50 UT, the high energy protons were detected by Radiation Assessment Detector

(RAD) (Hassler et al. 2012) from Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) (Ehresmann et al. 2018; Guo et al.

2018; Lee et al. 2018; Zeitlin et al. 2018). Later, high energetic protons were observed with a slow increase

at STEREO-A at around 08:00 UT on 11 September 2017 (Guo et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2018).

Attempts of modeling particle acceleration and transport of SEP events have been undertaken by many

groups (e.g. Heras et al. 1995; Kallenrode 1997; Luhmann et al. 2007, 2010, 2017). These models treat

CME-driven shock as a source of energetic particles without acceleration process. A dynamic onion-shell

model of the strong shock propagation and particle acceleration has been developed by Zank et al. (2000).

This model was improved by Rice et al.

(2003) for shocks with arbitrary intensities, and by Li et al.

(2003) to model the transport of energetic particles using a Monte-Carlo approach. Li et al. (2005) further

extended the model to include heavy ions. A comprehensive numerical model, developed by these authors,

called Particle Acceleration and Transport in the Heliosphere(PATH) model. Modeling speciﬁc SEP events

using the PATH model shows their reasonable agreement (Verkhoglyadova et al. 2009, 2010). Recently, Hu

et al. (2017) have extended the PATH to a 2D model, named improved Particle Acceleration and Transport

in the Heliosphere (iPATH). The new model has the capability to study the characters of particle acceleration

and transport at a 2D shock in multiple locations of the ecliptic plane. Hu et al. (2018) modelled an example

gradual SEP event as observed at multiple locations.

In the iPATH model, the shock speed proﬁle at the inner boundary is assumed to be a Gaussian form

in longitude and the propagation direction of the shock is assumed to be radial. Such an assumption is

for simplicity. As we discussed earlier, large lateral expansion of shocks can be common for large events.

A lateral expansion implies that the open angle of the shock will increase over time. This means that the

treatment of the inner boundary of the shock proﬁle in the iPATH model needs to be improved. In this

4

Z.-Y. Ding et al.

work, we modify the inner boundary of the shock proﬁle to examine the effect of the large lateral expansion

on producing solar energetic particles. We note that because the background solar wind is unlikely to be

homogeneous, the lateral expansion and the shock proﬁles do not need to be homogeneous. Therefore there

is no need to assume a symmetric eruption.

In this paper, we discuss our modeling of the 10 September 2017 GLE event using the iPATH model.

In section 2, we describe the iPATH model and the model setup. In section 3, we discuss the CME-driven

shock conﬁguration and shock parameters. Modelled time intensity proﬁle are compared with GOES-15

observation results in different energy channels. We integrate the data of proton ﬂux from the Advanced

Composition Explorer (ACE) and GOES-15 and ﬁt the spectrum using the Band function. The modelled

spectrum is compared with observation ﬁtted results. We also compare the modelled time intensity proﬁles

with the observation results at Mars and STEREO-A. We then discuss our results and conclude in section

4.

2 MODEL

The iPATH model is a two-dimensional MHD code plus a particle transport code developed by Hu et al.

(2017). It is a continuation of the earlier 1D PATH model (Zank et al. 2000;Li et al. 2003, 2005), addressing

solar energetic particle events in the ecliptic plane. It contains two separate modules: the ﬁrst module models

the background solar wind and follow particle acceleration at the shock front, the second module models

the transport of SEPs escaped from the upstream of the CME-driven shock. Here we limit ourselves to the

modiﬁcations that we introduce to the iPATH in modeling the 10 September 2017 event.

We model the propagation of background solar wind and CME-driven shock limited only in the ecliptic

plane using a 2D MHD code. For simplicity, the background solar wind is assumed to be homogeneous. We

use the 8-hour averaged in-situ solar wind observation near Earth before the CME eruption as the solar wind

inputs. The CME-driven shock is treated by perturbing the inner boundary (proton number density n, solar

wind speed Vsw and temperature T ) at 0.05 AU for a short period of time (e.g. 1 hour). Such a simpliﬁed

treatment is similar to the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model for the space weather prediction. The inner boundary

is set at 0.05 AU (∼ 10Rs) in this work, thus we can not model particle acceleration in the low corona.

Modeling CME eruption in the low corona needs a more detailed description about the magnetic ﬁeld and

the corona condition. However, CME-driven shock can be formed in the low corona (Gopalswamy et al.

2013, Liu et al. 2009) and some highest energy particles are produced within several solar radii. Modeling

this part of SEPs is beyond the scope of the iPATH model. In this work, we introduce two Gaussian velocity

proﬁles to account for both a lateral expansion of the shock and any inhomogeneity in the background solar

wind. Speciﬁcally, we consider the following eruption proﬁle:

where A1, A2 are the perturbed model parameters (number density, speed, temperature) at longitudes φc1

and φc2 . The angles φc1 and φc2 are the central longitude of the two Gaussian distributions. The variances

σ1, σ2 are related to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the perturbed width. For the second proﬁle,

we identify a range given by [φmin, φmax] as the perturbed range associated with the lateral expansion.

D1, D2 are the perturbing duration of two eruption proﬁles, and ts is the start time of the second eruption,

which we take as the start time of the lateral expansion. H is the Heaviside function. For simplicity, the

background interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be a Parker spiral,

where Br and Bφ are the radial and azimuthal component of the IMF at heliocentric distance r. usw is solar
wind speed. θ = 90◦ corresponds to the magnetic ﬁeld in the ecliptic plane. B0 is the radial component of

the IMF at R0.

After perturbing the inner boundary, the CME-driven shock is followed in the code and the shock pa-

rameters are calculated at every time step. From these shock parameters we obtain the dynamic timescale

tdyn = R

dR/dt . Balancing tdyn with the acceleration time scale yields the maximum particle momentum

Note that this functional form is different from previous works (e.g. Hu et al. 2017; Li et al. 2005), where

the exponential exp(−E/E0) tail was not included. In Drury (1983), the dynamical time tdyn in equa-

tion (3) is to be understood as the average time for accelerating particles from pinj to pmax. Clearly, some

portion of these particles would take longer time than tdyn. However, when t > tdyn, shock parameters

can not be regarded as constant anymore, so we expect a roll-over of f (p) near pmax. This, of course, is

the consequence of a ﬁnite acceleration time. In an earlier paper, Forman & Drury (1983) examined the

6

Z.-Y. Ding et al.

effect of ﬁnite time analytically and showed that the particle distribution function at higher momentum is of

exponential decay of the diffusion coefﬁcient, which is a function of particle momentum. Ellison & Ramaty

(1984) adopted an exponential decay tail at high energy ∼ exp(−E/E0) to account for the effect of ﬁnite

shock size and ﬁnite acceleration time. Some recent numerical simulations by Zuo et al. (2011) and Kong

et al. (2019) which examined particle acceleration at a prescribed shock showed that the time dependent

particle spectra are consistent with a power law with an exponential tail. With these considerations, we

adopt equation (4).

To model SEP events at multiple locations simultaneously, the iPATH model uses a 2D onion shell

module to keep track energetic particles in the shock complex. At the j-th time step, the j-th shell (the

outermost shell) is generated and divided longitudinally into different parcels (jr, kφ) with an angular width

of 5◦. Particles accelerated at the shock front experience convection with the parcel and diffusion between

parcels. Note that particles only diffuse in parcels whose pj,k

max are greater than particles’ momentum p.

This is because for parcels with pj,k

max < p, there is no excited wave turbulence that can trap these particles.

Particles can escape when they diffuse far enough ahead of the shock. Zank et al.
escape length l = 4λesc, where λesc = κrr
Ushk

is the scatter length scale and κrr is the particle upstream

(2000) assumed an

diffusion coefﬁcient in the direction of shock normal. Within the length l, the excited wave density is

signiﬁcantly higher than that of the ambient solar wind. If the wave intensity has no x-dependence, then the

particle distribution function decay exponentially with the escape length in the shock front. This allows one

to obtain the escaped particle distribution function. Alternatively Li et al. (2005) calculated the escaped

particle number explicitly instead of using the particle distribution function. Note, the escape boundary is

related to each individual parcel. In this work, we follow Li et al. (2005) and obtain the escaped particle

number of momentum p at time tk and at longitude φ related to the outmost parcel (jr, kφ) by,

where Nesc(k, p, tk) is the number of particles escaped from shock complex at time tk and longitude φ

2([rj+1,k(tk) − rj,k(tk)]/2)2 decides how many particles escape from the parcel (j, k). This parameter is

larger for high energy particles since the diffusion coefﬁcient κ increases with momentum. Nj,k (tk − 1) is

the particle number in the parcel (j, k) before diffusion, r∗

distance of the center of parcel (j, k), x = (resc − r∗

j = (rj,k + rj+1,k)/2 represents the heliocentric
j,k)/∆R∗ is a dimensionless parameter, and resc =

rJ(k,p),k + l represents the escaping boundary for particles of momentum p.

Once particles escape from the shock complex, they propagate along the IMF in the relatively undis-

turbed solar wind. We follow closely Hu et al. (2017) in describing the transport of escaping particles in the

second module of the iPATH model. In particular, we also include the cross-ﬁeld diffusion and use the back-
ward stochastic differential equation method. The cross-ﬁeld diffusion is governed by a term ∼ (cid:79)·(κ⊥ · (cid:79)f )

(see equation (18) of Hu et al. (2017)), where κ⊥ is the perpendicular diffusion coefﬁcient of energetic par-

Modeling solar energetic particle event of 10 September 2017

7

ticles, Hu et al. (2017) calculated κ⊥ from the parallel diffusion coefﬁcient κ(cid:107) based on the Non-Linear

Guiding Center theory (NLGC). In the NLGC theory, the solar wind turbulence is assumed to have a ge-

ometry of ”slab+2D”, where the slab component describes Alfv´enic ﬂuctuation along the background ﬁeld

and the 2D turbulence describes how the background ﬁeld line (here the Parker ﬁeld) meanders. An impor-

tant parameter describing the 2D component of the turbulence is the bend-over scale l2D (Shalchi et al.

2010). In the work of Hu et al. (2017) the radial dependence of lslab and l2D was ignored. Hu et al. (2018)

considered a more general case of,

lslab ∼ rα; l2D ∼ rα,

(7)

where α is a parameter and close to 1. In this work, we set α = 0.8 and assume the turbulent magnetic ﬁeld

square δB2 ∼ r−3, thus the radial dependence of κ(cid:107) and κ⊥ used in Hu et al. (2018) has the following

form:

where v is particle speed, B is the background magnetic ﬁeld, and r the heliocentric distance. In this work,

we set κ⊥/κ(cid:107) to be 0.0099 at 1AU for 1 MeV proton. With this choice of κ⊥, we examine cross ﬁeld

transport of energetic particles and discuss the observations at Mars and STA, which, as we show below,

depend strongly on κ⊥.

3 RESULTS

For our simulation, we average 8 hours of solar wind observation before the CME eruption as a guide to

the background solar wind inputs. This yields a solar wind speed as 500 km s−1, a magnetic ﬁeld of 3.9

nT and a number density of 0.8 cm−3 at 1 AU. Note that there were some preceding CMEs, which mostly

affects the number density of these three parameters. To account for the recovery of the corona after the

preceding CME, we use the 8-hours averaged number density of 3.5 cm−3 before shock arrival. As shown in

equation (1), we use a double Gaussian proﬁle for the velocity disturbance and the corresponding parameters

describing these two Gaussian proﬁles are listed in Table 1. To model the large lateral expansion, we use

a large variance for the second Gaussian distribution but limit the perturbation only within the longitudes

of [φmin, φmax] = [10, 90]. The perturbation duration (D1, D2) both are set to be 1 hour and the start time

(ts) for the second perturbation is at 1 hour. The injection efﬁciency is assumed to be 1% for θBN = 0 (i.e.

parallel shock geometry). We set the ambient turbulence level δB2/B2 to be 0.5 at 1 AU.

Figure 1 shows the location of various spacecraft when the event occurred and plots the scaled number

density for two cases: one for the single Gaussian perturbation and the other for a double Gaussian per-

turbation. When the CME erupted, Earth was located at r = 1.0 AU with φ = 0◦; and Mars was located

at 1.66 AU and φ = 157.5◦, STEREO-A is located at 0.96 AU and φ = 232◦. Venus and Mercury are

on the propagation path of this CME. However, there were no available data at these two locations. The

CME-driven shock arrived at Earth and Mars at ∼50.5 hours and ∼59 hours, respectively, after the eruption

(Guo et al. 2018). Previous work by Guo et al. (2018) of this event has obtained a speed of 2600 km s−1

at 17.6Rs with the central axis at 110◦. In another study by Luhmann et al. (2018) employing the Cone
model, the authors obtained a radial speed of 2500 km s−1 at 21.5Rs with the center axis at 108◦. In our

simulation with a single Gaussian proﬁle, shown in Figure 1 (a), we assumed the central axis is along φc=

100◦ and the variance σ of the Gaussian disturbance was set to be 42◦. At the inner boundary located at

0.05 AU (∼ 10Rs) we increase the solar wind speed to 2400 km s−1 and the number density from the

background by a factor of 4 at φc, and the disturbance lasts 1 hour. With these parameters, our simulated

shock arrival time is 49.2 hours at Earth and 58.5 hours at φ = 155◦ near Mars, in reasonable agreement

to observations. However, with these parameters, the eastern ﬂank of the shock, magnetically connecting to

Earth, is very weak and it does not accelerate particles to high energies. As noted by Liu et al. (2019), large

lateral expansion of CME-driven shock could lead to enhanced SEPs for observers that are connected to

the shock ﬂank. To evaluate the effect of the large lateral expansion, panel (b) of Figure 1 shows the shock

proﬁle using a double-Gaussian proﬁle with parameters given in Table 1. As we can see, a high density

blob now appears in the eastern ﬂank, leading to a locally enhanced shock compression ratio. The modelled

shock arrival times are also similar with observations: 48.5 hours of Earth and 58.1 hours in the longitude

of 155◦ near Mars. The shock speed at Earth is about 570 km s−1 (Liu et al. 2019), and the modelled shock

speed at Earth is about 650 km s−1.

Figure 2 plots the evolution of shock parameters in the ecliptic plane. Three observers at 1 AU with

different longitudes: 0◦,10◦,20◦ are chosen. The white dash lines in the ﬁgure are interplanetary magnetic

ﬁeld lines assuming a solar wind speed of 500 km/s. From panel (a) we can see that the eastern ﬂank of the

shock maintains a quasi-parallel geometry for the entire propagation, implying that the eastern ﬂank of the

shock has a higher efﬁciency to accelerate particles. Panel (b) shows the evolution of the shock speed. We

note that the shock speed is smaller than 1200 km/s most of the time when Earth connected to the shock

fronts. Panel (c) shows the maximum particle energy at shock fronts as the shock propagates from 10Rs

to 1 AU. The maximum energy occurs near the Sun at a longitude ∼ 110◦. However, even along the ﬁeld

line connecting to Earth, the maximum energy can reach hundreds MeV early on.This is due to large lateral

expansion: the presence of the second Gaussian proﬁle leads to a larger compression ratio and a larger shock

speed in the eastern ﬂank. Panel (d) shows the compression ratio along the shock front during the shock

Modeling solar energetic particle event of 10 September 2017

propagation. There are two high-compression-ratio lobes, corresponding to the two velocity proﬁles. The

high compression ratio in the eastern ﬂank enhances the acceleration efﬁciency, indicating the importance

of the large lateral expansion.

In Figure 3, the modelled time intensity proﬁles, shown in panels (b) to (d), at longitudes of 0◦ and

20◦ are compared with the observations of the Energetic Proton, Electron, and Alpha Detector (EPEAD-A)

instrument on board GOES-15, shown in panel (a). Note that the EPEAD-A detector has a westward-

viewing angle. From our model, we choose energy channels that are similar to the observations. Because

the shock arrival time differs for different longitudes, the x axis is normalized by Tn, the shock arrival

time for each observer. From panel (a) we can see that the observed intensity at all energy channels show

substantial enhancements at the beginning of the event and are followed by slow decays. Panel (b) presents

the simulated result at Earth (i.e. φ = 0). The intensity shows a rapid enhancement at the beginning, similar

to the observation. However, the decay is also very rapid, which differ considerably from the observation.

As shown in panel (b) and (d) of Figure 2, this is due to the fact that after ∼ 0.5 AU, Earth is connected to a

portion of the shock that has a weaker compression ratio and a low speed. Note that this connection is under

the assumption that the IMF is given by a Parker ﬁeld. There was some preceding CMEs in this event and the

magnetic connection can therefore be different from the Parker ﬁeld. We will discuss this later. Panel (c) is

the simulated result at longitude of 20◦. It is interesting to note that simulation results at longitudes 20◦ show

similar decay behavior as the observation. This observer maintains relatively long duration connecting to

regions of the shock that have high compression ratios. The presence of this long-duration high compression

ratio is the result of the second Gaussian proﬁle. Clearly, the assumption of the large lateral expansion of

CME-driven shock is crucial for our results. We also note that if the preceding CMEs perturb the IMF such

that Earth is also magnetically connected to the second Gaussian for an extended period, then we would

expect observers at Earth could see results similar to panel (c). Panel (d) shows the simulated result at Earth

with ﬁve times as large as κ⊥. The results between panel (b) and panel (d) are only slightly different, which

illustrates that by invoking a large perpendicular diffusion alone can not explain the Earth observation. One

may think that by aligning the center axis of the second Gaussian proﬁle closer to the Earth direction can

improve the simulation results at φ = 0◦ with an ambient ﬁeld that is Parker like. However, the proﬁle of the

second Gaussian proﬁle is constrained by the shock arrival time at Earth. If one further tunes the center axis

of the second Gaussian proﬁle toward φ = 0◦, the shock arrival time will be earlier than the observation.

As a consequence, one has to decrease the amplitude of the second Gaussian, which will lead to a weaker

shock and does not accelerate particles to high enough energy early on. Furthermore, if the second Gaussian

proﬁle is further towards Earth, the overall CME and shock proﬁle will be quite distorted and appear more

like two separate eruptions, which is not supported by observations.

Besides the time intensity proﬁles for the 6 energies, we also consider the event-integrated spectra at

φ = 20◦. Reasonable agreement with the observation is also obtained. Left panel of Figure 4 shows the

simulated and observed event-integrated proton ﬂuence. For the observation, we use the lower-energy data

10

Z.-Y. Ding et al.

from the Low Energy Magnetic Spectrometer-120 (LEMS-120) of the Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor

(EPAM) on board ACE, for four energy channels ranging from 330 keV to 4.75 MeV; and the high-energy

data from EPEAD-A (P2-P6) and the High Energy Proton and Alpha Detector (HEPAD, P8-P10) on board

GOES-15. The integration period is from 16:05 UT on 10 September 2017 to 18:30 UT on 12 September

2017.

We ﬁt both the observed and the modelled spectra with a Band-function form (Band et al. 1993), given

by,

J(E) = CE−γa [(γb − γa)E0]γb−γa exp(γa − γb) f or E (cid:62) (γb − γa)E0,

(9)

where J(E) is the particle ﬂuence, C is a normalization constant. γa and γb are the spectral indices in the

low energy region and high energy region respectively. E0 is the spectral break energy, which typically

occurs at energies of tens MeV. Following Bruno et al. (2019), we use the calibration schemes by Sandberg

et al. (2014) and Bruno (2017), below and above 80 MeV, respectively, to obtain the mean energy values

of every channel. Using different satellite instruments, calibration schemes and integrated periods lead

to different ﬁtted parameters. Cohen & Mewaldt

(2018) obtained γa ∼0.73, γb ∼3.39 and E0 ∼19.1

MeV. The smaller γa is caused by using data from the Ultra-Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS)

instrument on board ACE. Bruno et al. (2019) obtained γa ∼1.21, γb ∼ 4.04 and E0 ∼ 37.0 MeV for

a longer period, from 16:05 UT on 10 September 2017 to 00:00 UT on 17 September 2017. The ﬁtted

parameters for our period in this work are γa ∼1.21, γb ∼ 3.79 and E0 ∼ 38.68 MeV, similar to Bruno

et al. (2019). In comparison, the ﬁtted parameters of the modelled ﬂuence observed at longitude of 20◦

are: γa ∼ 1.14, γb ∼ 3.48 and E0 ∼ 50.77 MeV. These are similar to the observations. The right panel

of Figure 4 shows the simulated event-integrated proton ﬂuence at different longitudes of 0◦, 10◦ and 20◦.

Note that while the time intensity proﬁles at these three locations are quite different as shown in Figure 3,

the differences of the event-integrated spectra of these three observers are however, small. Nonetheless,

comparing the three spectral indices γb in the right panel shows that the high energy portion of the spectra

becomes softer as the longitude decreases. This is because at lower longitudes the observer connects to parts

of the shock ﬂank with a compression ratio decreases quicker.

This GLE event is one of the only two GLE events identiﬁed in the solar cycle 24. The high energy

spectral index of this GLE event was softer than many GLE events observed in cycle 23 (Cohen & Mewaldt

2018; Gopalswamy et al. 2018). Gopalswamy et al.

(2018) suggested that the soft spectrum may be

caused by poor latitudinal and longitudinal connectivities. Because the iPATH model is a 2D code and is

limited to the ecliptic plane, we cannot consider the latitudinal effects. As to the longitudinal connection,

our results suggests that the observation at Earth (with φ = 0◦) is very close to the simulation results at

longitude of 20◦. Note that our simulation assumes the background magnetic ﬁeld is given by the Parker

ﬁeld. Distortion of the background ﬁeld is possible due to preceding CMEs. There were multiple CMEs

prior to the September 10 event. A large and fast CME occurred on the 6th, whose propagation direction is

Modeling solar energetic particle event of 10 September 2017

11

40◦ west to Earth. At Earth, the magnetic cloud (MC) behind the shock was observed on the 8th and ends

on the beginning of 9th (Werner et al. 2019). It is very likely that the MC is a manifestation of a ﬂux rope

structure whose two feet are anchored on the solar surface. If so, as this ﬂux rope can further propagate

out, it can affect the ﬁeld that is connected to Earth on the 10th. Besides the CME on the 6th, there were

also multiple smaller CMEs occurred on the 8th and 9th. The effects of these smaller CMEs on the global

magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration are also unclear. In our simulation, we assume the background ﬁeld is of Parker,

so we can not address the connection issue. Note that the large lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock is

crucial for obtaining our results. Liu et al. (2019) have suggested that the enormous lateral expansion of the

shock has an important effect on SEPs production of this event. However, to our knowledge, there has been

no simulations addressing SEPs that consider the effect of lateral expansion of a CME and its driven shock.

A large lateral expansion of the shock can affect both the time intensity proﬁle and the even-integrated

spectra. This is clearly illustrated in Figure 2, from which we can see that the observer at φ = 20◦ can

initially connect to a weak part at the edge of ﬁrst Gaussian proﬁle (compression ratio ∼ 2) of the shock,

and followed by a stronger part (compression ratio ∼ 4) of the shock.

The high energy SEPs associated with the fast CME were also detected by Mars and STA. Zeitlin et al.

(2018) reported the radiation dose rate on the surface of Mars measured by the Radiation Assessment

Detector (RAD), mounted on the Mars Science Laboratory’s (MSL’s) curiosity rover. The black curve

shown in Figure 5 is the derived integral ﬂux of proton energy greater than 113 MeV observed by RAD

(Zeitlin et al. 2018). The proton onset time is 19:50 on 10 September 2017 at Mars, which was ∼4 hours

after the CME onset. A rapid increase is detected after the onset. The red curve in Figure 5 is the simulated

integral ﬂux of proton energy greater than 119 MeV. The event peaked on 11 September, from about 4:00

to 14:00 UT (Zeitlin et al. 2018). The modelled result shows a similar peak in the ﬁgure. From panel (b)

of Figure 1 we can see that Mars was connected to the very western ﬂank of the shock initially and as

the shock propagates out, the connection becomes ever weaker. Many SEPs observed at Mars are particles

that undergo cross ﬁeld diffusion in the IMF. They are accelerated at the stronger part of the shock. To the

observer at Mars, the event is a typical eastern event. Therefore we see a clear decay phase after the peak.

The shock arrival time is ∼02:50 UT on 13 September 2017 followed by a clear Forbush decrease (Guo et

al. 2018). The simulated shock arrival time is ∼02:00 UT on 13 September 2017.

STEREO-A also observed this event. In Figure 6, the modelled proton time intensity proﬁle in the

energy bands 11.2-94.3 MeV is shown as the blue curve. This is to be compared with observation of 13.6-

100 MeV proton (red curve) from the High Energy Telescope (HET) instruments onboard STEREO-A.

Both of them show a gradual rising phase after the CME eruption. The absolute value of the ﬂux are also

similar. The STA was at longitude of 232◦ which was connected to the back side of the sun when the CME

erupted. Therefore the SEPs detected at STA must have undergone cross ﬁeld diffusion as they propagate

out. Our results suggest that the perpendicular diffusion coefﬁcients and its radial dependence used in this

work are reasonable.

4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we model the 10 September 2017 SEP event using the iPATH model. The most important as-

sumption we made in this work is a large lateral expansion of CME-driven shock, modelled by two Gaussian

velocity proﬁles. In previous practices of iPATH modeling (Fu et al. 2019; Hu et al. 2017, 2018), a sin-

gle symmetric Gaussian-shape velocity proﬁle is adopted to simulate the inner boundary condition of the

the CME-driven shock. To illustrate the lateral expansion, we use a velocity proﬁle at the inner boundary

consisting of two Gaussian proﬁles with different propagation directions and different start times. We then

examine the time intensity proﬁles and the event-integrated spectra at multiple observation locations corre-

sponding to observers at Earth, Mars and the STEREO-A spacecraft. We adjust the initial CME perturbation

parameters such that the modelled shock arrival times at Earth and Mars are close to the observations. The

introduction of a second velocity proﬁle to mimic the lateral expansion leads to stronger particle accelera-

tion at the eastern ﬂank of the shock, which is necessary to understand the observation at Earth. Our model

results at φ = 0◦, which is the Earth’s location, show similar event-integrated spectra as the ACE and GOES

observations, but the modelled time intensity proﬁle shows a clear differences from that of observation. In

comparison, the model results at φ = 20◦ are comparable to ACE and GOES observations for both the

time intensity proﬁles and the event-integrated spectra. We interpret this by a possible ﬁeld line distortion

due to preceding events. There were multiple smaller CMEs before this event, which can cause the IMF

to be deviated from the nominal Parker conﬁguration. We do point out that in the acceleration module of

our model a Parker-like background IMF is assumed. When the unperturbed ﬁeld line is non-Parker, it will

affect the shock obliquity, and therefore the acceleration process. Modelling a CME with a non-Parker ﬁeld

is out of the scope of this work and will be pursued in a future work.

We also obtain time intensity proﬁles at longitudes that correspond to Mars and STEREO-A. The model

results at these two locations are in good agreements with the observations. Because both Mars and STA are

not well connected to the CME-driven shock, SEPs observed in these locations have to undergo cross-ﬁeld

diffusion. The agreements between the modeling results and the observations therefore provide a conﬁrma-

tion of our choice of the perpendicular diffusion coefﬁcient, and its radial dependence.

Our study suggests that modeling a realistic SEP event needs 1) an in-depth understanding of the in-

ﬂuence of preceding CMEs, in particular the effect of a non-Parker ﬁeld, and 2) taking into account of

possible lateral expansion. Indeed, observations have shown that large lateral expansion of CME-driven

shock is quite frequent in large eruptions, so considering the lateral expansion and capturing a realistic

CME-driven shock proﬁle, such as the shock speed and obliquity along the shock surface is also crucial for

any SEP modelings. We point out that lateral expansion are intrinsically inhomogeneous because the plasma

conditions at different part of the shock ﬂank are different. In this work, we use a second Gaussian proﬁle

to mimic the lateral expansion. Finally, ﬁtting observations at multiple longitudes can provide very strong

constraints on the perpendicular diffusion coefﬁcients of energetic particles. Although our simulation is for

the 10 September 2017 event, it forms a nice basis for understanding other large SEP events as well.
