High-intensity laser pulses covering the ultraviolet to terahertz spectral regions are nowadays
routinely generated in a large number of laboratories. In contrast, intense extreme-ultraviolet (XUV)
pulses have only been demonstrated using a small number of sources including free-electron laser
facilities [1–3] and long high-harmonic generation (HHG) beamlines [4–9]. Here we demonstrate
a concept for a compact intense XUV source based on HHG that is focused to an intensity of
2 × 1014 W/cm2, with a potential increase up to 1017 W/cm2 in the future. Our approach uses
tight focusing of the near-infrared (NIR) driving laser and minimizes the XUV virtual source size
by generating harmonics several Rayleigh lengths away from the NIR focus. Accordingly, the XUV
pulses can be refocused to a small beam waist radius of 600 nm, enabling the absorption of up to four
XUV photons by a single Ar atom in a setup that ﬁts on a modest (2 m) laser table. Our concept
represents a straightforward approach for the generation of intense XUV pulses in many laboratories,
providing novel opportunities for XUV strong-ﬁeld and nonlinear optics experiments, for XUV-pump
XUV-probe spectroscopy and for the coherent diﬀractive imaging of nanoscale structures.

Nonlinear optical techniques have widespread applica-
tions including frequency mixing [10–12], Raman ampli-
ﬁcation [13], Kerr-lens modelocking [14] and self-phase
modulation [15, 16]. In the long-wavelength range, the
development of compact and eﬃcient secondary terahertz
sources with microjoule energies [17] has boosted the ﬁeld
of nonlinear terahertz optics [18]. The situation is diﬀer-
ent in the XUV and X-ray wavelength range, where the
generation of high pulse energies in combination with
high intensities has only been demonstrated at a lim-
ited number of facilities including free-electron lasers [1–
3] and at long (≥ 10 m) HHG beamlines [4–9]. While ﬁrst
nonlinear XUV optics experiments including multiphoton
absorption [19–21], four-wave mixing [22] and XUV-XUV
pump-probe spectroscopy [23] have been performed, the
large sizes and complexity of existing experimental setups
using intense XUV pulses impede faster progress in this
ﬁeld, which would beneﬁt from more compact and less
complex setups. Such sources would furthermore pave
the way to the application of powerful techniques like
attosecond-pump attosecond-probe spectroscopy [6, 24]
and coherent diﬀractive imaging of nanoscale structures
and nanoparticles [5, 25, 26] in a much larger number of
laboratories than is currently the case.

Our concept for a compact intense XUV source is based
on HHG, which has traditionally been performed at or
close to the focal plane of the fundamental laser [12] be-
cause of the high driving light intensities (≈ 1014 W/cm2)
that are required for eﬃcient HHG. After more powerful
driving lasers became available, loose-focusing geometries
were adopted [4–9], in which the fundamental laser is fo-
cused by a lens or a spherical mirror with a long focal
length on the order of 10 m. This increases the focus

size of the fundamental laser, leading to a large volume
from which high harmonics are emitted and resulting in
XUV pulses with microjoule energies [4, 20, 27]. A cru-
cial disadvantage of this approach is its complexity and
its intrinsic requirement of a large laboratory. Moreover,
this approach does not readily lead to higher XUV inten-
sities, since the XUV source size grows proportionally to
the focal length that is used [28], and source demagniﬁ-
cation factors that can be achieved using focusing optics
are ﬁnite.

In order to increase the focused XUV intensity in a
compact setup, we propose to generate high harmon-
ics several Rayleigh lengths away from the focal plane
of the driving laser, employing a focusing element with
a relatively short focal length of 1 m (see Fig. 1a). As
schematically shown in Fig. 1b, this leads to a situation
where the driving laser wavefronts in the HHG medium
are curved, resulting in curved wavefronts of the gen-
erated XUV pulses [29]. Due to the short wavelengths
of the generated harmonics, this curved wavefront is ac-
companied by a virtual HHG source size that is much
smaller than the focus size of the driving laser, as we will
demonstrate later. Further demagniﬁcation of the HHG
source size (here, using a spherical B4C-coated mirror
with f = 75 mm) results in a small XUV focus size and a
high XUV intensity that can be used for experiments. In
the experiments to be discussed in this paper, the entire
XUV beamline has a length of 2 m, which is comparable
to or even smaller than most standard HHG beamlines.
To demonstrate the applicability of this scheme,
we performed an experiment at the Max-Born-Institut
(MBI), where high harmonics were generated in a Kr
gas jet (1.5 mm length) that was operated at a backing

FIG. 1: Compact intense XUV source. a,
Experimental setup: NIR driving pulses with a duration
of 40 fs and a pulse energy of up to 16 mJ are focused
using a spherical lens with f = 1 m. HHG takes place in
a high-pressure gas jet that is placed in the converging
or diverging NIR beam. An Al ﬁlter attenuates the NIR
pulses after HHG, and the XUV pulses are focused to
high intensities by a spherical mirror with f = 75 mm.

transfer of curved wavefronts from the fundamental to

size which is signiﬁcantly smaller than the NIR focus
size. c, HHG yield using Kr at a backing pressure of
4 bar as a function of the distance between the jet and
the NIR focus (blue curve). The maximum XUV
photon yield is observed when the jet is placed 2.5 cm
behind the NIR focus. The relative NIR peak intensity
as a function of the jet-focus distance (gray dotted
curve) was determined using a camera, while the
absolute NIR peak intensity was determined at the NIR
focal plane using the measured NIR beam waist radius,
pulse duration and pulse energy. At 2.5 cm the NIR
peak intensity is 4 × 1014 W/cm2, i.e. 25 times smaller
than at the focus.

pressure of 4 bar, using 40 fs near-infrared (NIR) driving
pulses with a central wavelength of 800 nm and a pulse
energy of 16 mJ. Fig. 1c shows the HHG yield as a func-
tion of the distance between the NIR focal plane and the
gas jet. As a general feature we observe two maxima
of the HHG yield, one when the jet is behind the NIR
focus and another one when the jet is in front of the
NIR focus. For the speciﬁc parameters used in Fig. 1c,
the curve has a maximum at 2.5 cm, meaning that the
jet is placed 2.5 cm — or about 5 Rayleigh lengths —
behind the NIR focus. The NIR intensity at this posi-

spectra at backing pressures of 1 bar and 4 bar,
exhibiting a clear blueshift in the latter case. The XUV

backing pressure of 4 bar is shown in the inset on the
right side. b, Using a backing pressure of 4 bar, the

tion is 4 × 1014 W/cm2, which is much smaller than the
NIR intensity at the focus (1 × 1016 W/cm2). This corre-
sponds to a regime where the NIR beam propagation and
the propagation of the XUV beam resulting from HHG
can be well approximated by geometrical optics. Using
this scheme, an XUV pulse energy of 0.3 µJ was mea-
sured using an XUV photodiode (AXUV100G), which is
comparable to the results obtained with two long HHG
beamlines available at the MBI [7, 21].

We will show in the following that HHG far away from
the NIR focus exhibits a number of favorable proper-
ties which are beneﬁcial for applications. As depicted in
Fig. 2a, variation of the backing pressure results in an
HHG yield that is almost constant for backing pressures
> 1 bar, making the optimization of HHG straightfor-
ward. Corresponding HHG spectra at backing pressures
of 1 bar and 4 bar are shown in the left inset and demon-

XUV ﬂux is observed in the simulations, which is com-
parable to the XUV ﬂux that we have obtained in a sim-
ulation using an upscaled HHG source, where an NIR
focal length of 9 m and an extended gas medium with
a length of 20 mm were used. The corresponding XUV
beam proﬁle at a distance of 50 cm from the gas jet pre-
sented in Fig. 3b exhibits a divergence similar to the ex-
periment. This beam proﬁle has an annular structure,
which can be less or more pronounced depending on the
speciﬁc parameters used in the simulations. We note
that an annular beam proﬁle was also observed exper-
imentally in certain conditions, but for the current ex-
periments we chose to optimize the beam proﬁle to be
more homogeneous (see inset of Fig. 2a). Diﬀerence in
the XUV beam proﬁles might also be explained by the
fact that an ideal NIR Gaussian beam was used in the
simulation, whereas the NIR beam used in the experi-
ment was not an ideal Gaussian beam. As depicted in
Fig. 3c, backpropagation of the simulated XUV pulses
— centered at 55 nm wavelength — shows that the vir-
tual HHG source is located close to the NIR focal plane
and has a beam waist radius of only 3.5 µm (Fig. 3c),
which is signiﬁcantly smaller than the simulated NIR
beam waist radius of 30 µm. Demagniﬁcation of the vir-
tual XUV source using a spherical XUV focusing mirror
with f = 75 mm placed 70 cm behind the NIR focus re-
sults in an XUV beam waist radius of only 350 nm, which
is substantially smaller compared to the values achieved
in loose-focusing HHG setups [5, 7, 8, 20, 26]. Using the
calculated beam waist radius in combination with the
calculated XUV pulse duration of ∆t = 25 fs and using a
pulse energy of E = 30 nJ as available in the experiment
(taking into account an aluminium (Al) ﬁlter transmis-
sion of 40 % and a focusing mirror reﬂectivity of 25 %),
the theoretically achievable XUV peak intensity is esti-
mated as Ipeak = 2E/(∆tπw2

0) = 8 × 1014 W/cm2.

The ability to generate intense XUV pulses is experi-
mentally demonstrated by studying multiphoton absorp-
tion in Ar atoms. To this end, we generated harmon-
ics in Xe (using a backing pressure of 2 bar and an NIR
pulse energy of 8 mJ) and focused the XUV pulses into
an atomic jet using a B4C-coated spherical mirror with
a focal length of 75 mm. Applying ion spatial imaging
(see Methods for details), Ar2+ and Ar3+ ion yields were
recorded along the XUV propagation direction, as shown
in Fig. 4a,b. While the Ar+ ion yield is constant as a
function of the distance from the XUV focal plane (not
shown), the Ar2+ and Ar3+ ion yields are peaked at
the XUV focal plane, demonstrating that these signals
scale nonlinearly with the XUV intensity. The genera-
tion of Ar2+ from neutral Ar requires an energy of at
least 43.4 eV, indicating that its generation is the result
of a two-photon absorption process, considering that the
maximum XUV photon energy is 27.8 eV (see Fig. 4d).
Indeed, the Ar2+ ion yield was found to scale as I 1.9±0.1
(see Fig. 4e). Similarly, the generation of Ar3+ ions,

XUV beam proﬁle 50 cm away from the gas jet. c, The
beam radius of the backpropagated XUV beam as a
function of distance from the gas jet shows that the
position of the virtual XUV source almost coincides
with the NIR focal plane, which is consistent with the
predictions of the modeling performed in Ref. [29]. d,

strate that the individual harmonics are blueshifted when
the pressure is increased, which provides a possibility to
tune the HHG spectra. This blueshift is a consequence
of propagation eﬀects of the NIR driving laser in the gas
jet [30]. The XUV beam proﬁle measured 50 cm from the
gas jet is depicted in the inset on the right side of Fig. 2a.
As a direct consequence of generating harmonics far away
from the NIR focus, we ﬁnd that the corresponding full-
width half maximum divergence matches the NIR diver-
gence of 10 mrad. Fig. 2b shows that the HHG yield
increases monotonically with increasing NIR pulse en-
ergy, demonstrating that the presented HHG scheme is
scalable. A further advantage is that the shot-to-shot
ﬂuctuations are low, making this a very robust source.
As shown in the inset of Fig. 2b, a standard deviation of
1.5 % was measured over 1000 single shots.

To better understand HHG far away from the driving
laser focus, we performed simulations (see Methods for
details). Fig. 3a shows how the NIR pulse is reshaped
in the gas medium: The initial Gaussian spatial proﬁle
of the driving laser is modiﬁed to an almost ﬂat-top NIR
proﬁle after propagating through the jet as a result of ab-
sorption (including losses due to ionization [31]). In this
way, an NIR intensity of ∼ 6 × 1013 W/cm2 is achieved
over a large volume. As a consequence, a relatively high

achieved by further scaling of our approach. We expect
the XUV intensity to scale as IXU V ∝ E2
N IR (where
EN IR is the NIR pulse energy), if all relevant parame-
ters including the NIR beam size before focusing and the
XUV focusing mirror size are scaled appropriately. Us-
ing e.g. an NIR pulse energy of 40 mJ instead of 8 mJ for
HHG in Xe as well as a 5 times larger NIR beam area
before focusing (using the same focusing lens), the XUV
pulse energy is expected to increase by a factor of 5 due to
the 5 times larger generation area, whereas the NIR focal
area and the XUV virtual source area are expected to de-
crease by a factor of 5, resulting in a 25 times higher XUV
intensity. In this case, the XUV focusing mirror needs to
5 larger XUV beam diver-
be able to accommodate the
gence. If accompanied by a reduction of the XUV pulse
duration ≤ 1 fs [6, 24], an intensity of 1017 W/cm2 would
come within reach.

√

In summary, we have demonstrated a compact setup
for the generation of high XUV intensities by generating
high harmonics several Rayleigh lengths away from the
driving laser focus. This concept beneﬁts from two fa-
vorable properties: (i) A large number of XUV photons
are emitted from the large generation volume without
the need to apply a loose-focusing geometry. (ii) XUV
pulses with curved wavefronts are generated, and are ac-
companied by a small virtual XUV source size, making
refocusing of the XUV pulses to a small beam waist ra-
dius possible. The small size and robustness of our con-
cept makes it straightforward to generate intense XUV
pulses in a large number of laboratories in the future.
Areas that we may expect to beneﬁt from this develop-
ment are XUV-pump XUV-probe spectroscopy in gases,
liquids and solids as well as coherent diﬀractive imaging
of nanoscale structures and nanoparticles. Furthermore,
our concept is ideally suited for experiments that require
either a high XUV ﬂux or a small XUV focus.

which requires a minimum energy of 84.1 eV, is attributed
to a four-photon absorption process. In combination with
the measured XUV beam radius on the XUV focusing
mirror (wXU V,mirror = 7.4 mm), the Ar2+ ion distribu-
tion along the XUV propagation direction (blue curve in
Fig. 4c) can be used to estimate the Rayleigh length of
the XUV beam as zR = 6.5 µm (see Methods) and its
waist radius as w0 = wXU V,mirror(1 + d2
R)−1/2 ≈
wXU V,mirrorzR/dXU V = (600 ± 100) nm, where dXU V =
81 mm is the distance between the XUV focusing mir-
ror and the image plane. The larger value with respect
to the calculated beam waist radius of 300 nm may be
attributed to imperfect alignment as well as to wave-
front distortions induced by the NIR pulse and by the
XUV focusing mirror. Combining this waist radius with
the afore-mentioned XUV pulse duration of 25 fs and
the pulse energy of 30 nJ, the experimental XUV peak
intensity is estimated as Ipeak = 2 × 1014 W/cm2.

the future, signiﬁcantly higher XUV intensities could be

METHODS

Experimental methods. The experiments were per-
formed using a Ti:sapphire laser system [32] operating at
a central wavelength of 790 nm and delivering pulses with
an energy up to 35 mJ and a duration of 40 fs. A pulse en-
ergy of up to 16 mJ was used in the current experiments.
These pulses were focused using a spherical lens with a
focal length of 1 m and coupled into the vacuum using
a 3 mm thick fused silica window. A pulsed gas jet was
generated by a piezoelectric valve with a nozzle diame-
ter of 0.5 mm that was mounted from above, applying a
backing pressure of up to 10 bar. The relative position of
the laser focus with respect to the gas jet was varied by
mounting the lens on a long translation stage. A charge-
coupled device (CCD) camera was used to record NIR
beam proﬁles at the gas jet position.

The NIR pulses co-propagating with the HHG pulses
were attenuated using a 100 nm thick Al ﬁlter. The XUV
pulses were spectrally resolved using a diﬀraction grating,
and the spectra were recorded using a microchannel plate
(MCP) / phosphor screen assembly in combination with
a CCD camera. The XUV beam proﬁle was measured

via the same detection method and using the grating in
zeroth order. The XUV pulse energy was measured by
an XUV photodiode (AXUV100G) that was temporarily
placed at a distance of about 0.5 m behind the gas jet.

To generate high XUV intensities, the XUV pulses
were refocused using a B4C-coated spherical mirror with
a focal length of 75 mm that was placed at a distance of
103 cm behind the gas jet. The focused XUV beam was
intersected by a pulsed gas jet that was generated by a
piezoelectric valve [33]. A molecular beam skimmer with
an oriﬁce diameter of 0.5 mm was used to select the cen-
tral part of the atomic beam and to provide eﬃcient dif-
ferential pumping between the gas jet chamber and the
interaction chamber. Photoions were generated in the
interaction zone of a velocity-map imaging spectrome-
ter [34], which was operated in spatial imaging mode.
The MCP / phosphor screen detector of the VMIS was
gated to be able to separately record the ions in diﬀerent
charge states.

To determine the XUV Rayleigh length from the Ar2+
ion distribution, the measurement shown in Fig. 4a was
repeated at a lower gas density to avoid any possible
space charge eﬀects. The Ar2+ ion yield scales with
I 2(z) × w2(z) ∝ 1/w4(z) × w2(z) = 1/w2(z), assuming
that two XUV photons are required for the generation of
Ar2+. Here I(z) is the intensity as a function of the dis-
(cid:112)(1 + z2/z2
R)
tance from the focal plane and w(z) = w0
is the beam radius as a function of the distance from the
focal plane. It follows that the Ar2+ ion distribution is
proportional to (1 + z2/z2
R)−1. This formula was used to
ﬁt the measured Ar2+ ion distribution. In addition, the
transverse Ar2+ ion distribution was used to determine
the spatial resolution after applying a Gaussian ﬁt. De-
convolution of these two curves results in the extracted
Ar2+ ion distribution shown as a red curve in Fig. 4c,
from which a Rayleigh length of 6.5 µm was obtained.
For comparison, we also show the convolution of the red
and black curves as green dotted curve, which agrees well
with the measured Ar2+ distribution (blue curve).

Numerical methods. The HHG simulations were per-
formed with an extended version of a three-dimensional
nonadiabatic simulation code described in [35]. The
model solves the paraxial wave equation in combination
with the Lewenstein integral [36] to obtain the macro-
scopic response of a gas medium to a strong laser ﬁeld. As

a ﬁrst step, propagation of the laser pulse in the ionized
medium is calculated assuming a cylindrical symmetry
and taking into account the time- and space-dependent
neutral and plasma dispersion, along with the optical
Kerr eﬀect. The dipole responses of single atoms in the
interaction volume are obtained using the strong-ﬁeld
approximation. These dipole responses serve as source
terms in each spatial grid point of the interaction medium
when solving the wave equation of similar form as for the
fundamental laser ﬁeld. When calculating the propaga-
tion of the harmonic ﬁeld, neutral dispersion and absorp-
tion are taken into account. Further details are available
in the supplementary material of Ref. [37]. Backpropaga-
tion of the generated high-harmonic radiation was carried
out using the ABCD-Hankel transform [38].
