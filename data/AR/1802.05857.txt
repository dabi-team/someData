We employ the recently introduced Ising-QCD partition function (N. G. Antoniou et al., Phys.
Rev. D 97, 034015 (2018)) to explore in detail the behaviour of the moments of the baryon-number,
within the critical region around the critical endpoint. Our analysis is based on the relation of
ﬁnite-size scaling in real space with intermittency in transverse momentum space. It demonstrates
in practice the recent observation (N. G. Antoniou et al., Phys. Rev. D 97, 034015 (2018)) that
combined measurements of the intermittency index φ2 and the freeze-out parameters µb (baryochem-
ical potential), T (temperature), provide us with a powerful tool to detect the critical point. We
also show that the ﬁnite-size scaling (FSS) region, as a part of the critical region, is very narrow
in both the chemical potential and the temperature direction, even for light nuclei. Furthermore,
sN N = 17.2 GeV (NA49
using published experimental results for (µb, T, φ2) in A+A collisions at
experiment, CERN-SPS), we are able to make a set of predictions for the freeze-out states of Ar
+ Sc and Xe + La collisions at the same energy in the NA61/SHINE experiment (CERN-SPS). In
particular, we ﬁnd that the Ar + Sc system freezes out outside the FSS region but very close to its
boundary, a property which may leave characteristic traces in intermittency analysis.

INTRODUCTION

2

The hunt for the QCD critical endpoint (CEP), remnant of the chiral symmetry breaking, in modern ion collision
experiments approaches its apex. During the last decade it became evident that in the phase diagram of strongly
interacting matter of ﬁnite size, as it is the case for colliding nuclei, the CEP is replaced by an extended critical region
in the temperature-baryon chemical potential plane [2]. Recent experimental measurements of the baryon number
non-Gaussian kurtosis κ (times variance σ2) in the Beam-Energy Scan (BES-I) program at BNL-RHIC [3] display a
broad minimum in the range 15 GeV <
s < 40 GeV as a function of the beam energy. This non-monotonic behaviour
is interpreted as a potential trace of criticality [3, 4]. Two years ago, measurements of the intermittency index φ2,
employing proton transverse momenta in A+A collisions at beam energy
s = 17.2 GeV in NA49 experiment (CERN-
SPS), provided an indication for the occurrence of critical ﬂuctuations in the Si + ”Si” freeze-out state [5]. These
two, seemingly incompatible results if the critical region is not unnaturally wide, may constitute an invaluable guide
for locating the CEP, as we will show in the analysis presented in this paper.

√

√

Our aim is to use the recently introduced Ising-QCD partition function [1] to investigate in some detail the phe-
nomenology of the critical region in terms of ﬁnite-size scaling (FSS) in baryon number moments and its relation to
intermittency in momentum space. In our treatment we consider the freeze-out states generated in relativistic ion
collision experiments in thermal and chemical equilibrium as supported also by the experimental ﬁndings. Therefore,
we expect that dynamical eﬀects related to the relaxation process and studied recently in the literature [6, 7], are not
necessarily the guiding rules in the phenomenology of the baryonic ﬂuid in the critical region, which is governed by
equilibrated critical ﬂuctuations.

√

In particular we will demonstrate that the FSS region, which is a subregion of the critical one, is very narrow along
the temperature direction, particularly for large size ions. This suggests that the formation of freeze-out states within
the scaling region of the critical point, is visible in central collisions of relatively light ions (A ≈ 27 ± 4) with colliding
energy
s ≈ 17.2 GeV. We discuss the impact of our analysis on expected results for the most important running ion
experiments: the NA61/SHINE (SPS, CERN) and the STAR (BNL, RHIC). We ﬁnd that accurate measurements of
the intermittency index φ2 in Ar + Sc central and peripheral collisions at highest colliding energy (
s = 17 GeV) of
the running NA61/SHINE experiment (CERN-SPS) could provide helpful information for the location of the QCD
CEP. On the opposite side, due to the narrowness of the critical region along the baryochemical direction [1], the
beam energy scan in BES program at RHIC (BNL) cannot resolve the critical region. Such a task would require
much denser covering of the colliding energy range than that available in BES I. Our analysis reveals that in general
the strategy of using only ions of large size is not optimal for the CEP search. In addition the energy scan is also
inadequate since the scaling region around the CEP is very narrow. In fact, the size scan becomes decisive.

√

Our paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we brieﬂy present the theoretical framework (Ising-QCD partition
function) used in our subsequent phenomenological analysis. More extensive presentation can be found in [1]. In
section 3 we present the connection of ﬁnite-size scaling in conﬁguration space with intermittency in transverse
momentum space emphasizing on the constraints imposed to the temperature for freezing out within the FSS region.
In section 4 we perform a detailed phenomenological analysis, combining existing experimental results with the
theoretical framework developed in [1], in order to obtain a set for predictions concerning measurable quantities,
related to critical ﬂuctuations, in the NA61/SHINE and STAR experiments. Finally, in section 5 we present our
conclusions and give also some perspectives in forthcoming experimental searches for the CEP.

II.

ISING-QCD CRITICAL THERMODYNAMICS

We start our study recalling the basic thermodynamics of the critical ﬂuid, which signals the QCD CEP, adopting
the viewpoint of [1]. Due to baryon number conservation, the slow mode of the order parameter, dominating at
macroscopic scales, is the baryon number density nb. Since the CEP is expected to belong to the 3-d Ising universality
class, as supported by several theoretical works[8–12], the ﬂuctuations of nb near the critical point are described by
the universal eﬀective action found by Monte-Carlo simulations in [13]. Thus, the thermodynamics of the strong
interacting matter close to the CEP are determined by the Ising-QCD partition function:

where N is the baryon number in volume V = M β3

ﬁxed by the critical temperature Tc. The dimensionless variable M quantiﬁes the size of the considered baryonic
system. The dimensionless universal couplings g4 = 0.97 ± 0.02, g6 = 2.05 ± 0.15 are calculated in [13] while ˆm = βcm
is related to the correlation length ξ = m−1 of the inﬁnite system. Finally, ζ = exp[ µb−µc

kB Tc

3

is the (critical) baryochemical potential. The partition function (1) provides a valid description of the critical ﬂuid
thermodynamics within the critical region where a distinction between hadronic and quark phase is not possible. As
T approaches Tc the ﬂuid enters into the ﬁnite-size scaling (FSS) region for which ξ > V 1/d (with d the topological
dimension, here d = 3). Deﬁning t± = | T±−Tc

|, the border of the FSS region in the temperature axis is given by:

with ν = 2
3 the correlation length critical exponent for the 3-d Ising. The index ”±” is used to indicate that there are
diﬀerent correlation length amplitudes above (ξ0,+) and below (ξ0,−) the critical temperature Tc with a universal ratio
ξ0,+
≈ 2 in the 3-d Ising class [14]. As a consequence, the FSS region for T > Tc is more extended in the temperature
ξ0,−
direction than the corresponding region for T < Tc. A quantitative estimate of the width of the FSS region requires
the knowledge of the critical temperature Tc and one of the amplitudes ξ0,+ or ξ0,−.

III. FINITE-SIZE SCALING AND INTERMITTENCY IN MOMENTUM SPACE

According to the Ising-QCD partition function (1), within the FSS region in the (mub, T )-plane, the integrated

baryon number density moments, as shown in [1], very close to CEP obey the scaling relation(s):

(cid:104)N k(cid:105) ∼ M kq

;

q = dF /d, k = 1, 2, ..

(3)

with d the embedding (topological) dimension and dF the fractal dimension related to the baryon number density
critical ﬂuctuations. The latter, as discussed in earlier work [18], imply also a local scaling behaviour of the baryon
number density-density correlation function:

(cid:104)nb(r)nb(r0)(cid:105) ∼ |r − r0|−d(1−q)

(4)

Within the FSS region, the scaling law (4) applies also for large |r − r0|, i.e. at scales of the order of the system’s
size. This property has an important consequence: the power-law behaviour of eq. (4) is transferred to an analogous
behaviour in transverse momentum space for small momenta diﬀerences through a Fourier transform [19], as dictated
by critical opalescence. Adapted to the geometry of the ﬁreball created in relativistic ion collisions, this line of
thoughts leads to the appearance of a power-law behaviour of the baryon number density-density correlation function
in transverse momentum space [1, 18, 19] of the form:

(cid:104)nb(k)nb(k0)(cid:105) ∼ |k − k0|− 2

3 dq

(5)

which is directly observable through intermittency analysis. The latter requires the calculation of the second factorial
moment of the proton number density within M⊥ small cells of transverse momentum space and looking for the scaling
behaviour:

F2(M⊥) ∼ (M⊥)φ2

;

φ2 =

1
3

qd , q =

6

, d = 3

(6)

in terms of the number of cells M⊥ [18]. Thus, the exponent q of FSS in real space is directly linked to the intermittency
index φ2 in transverse momentum space: φ2 = q and therefore it is an observable quantity characterizing the scaling
region. In fact, as discussed in [1], this link between scaling at large distances in conﬁguration space and intermittency
(scaling of factorial moments) in transverse momentum space, holds for the entire FSS region, despite that the value
of q varies, as we depart from the immediate neighborhood of the CEP, becoming ˜q (cid:54)= dF /d. Of course in this more
general case: φ2 = ˜q. As argued in [1] the critical region associated with the QCD CEP is determined by the condition:

3
4

< ˜q < 1

(7)

while the FSS region is the sub-domain of the critical region for which both eq. (7), as well as the condition that
the correlation length of the inﬁnite system is greater than the characteristic system’s size, are valid. In the context
of intermittency in transverse momentum space we are interested in the transverse size of the system. In the case
of colliding ions, the transverse size of the formed ﬁreball can be at best estimated in the central rapidity region
where transverse and longitudinal coordinates decouple [18]. Then, a natural measure for the average transverse size
is obtained by R⊥ =
S with S the average transverse area of the formed ﬁreball. Assuming radial symmetry, the

latter can be estimated as: S = πR2 with R = R0A1/3 and R0 ≈ 1.25 fm. To calculate the inﬁnite system’s correlation
length ξ and compare with R⊥ we need to know the critical temperature Tc and the non-universal amplitude ξ0,+, as
also discussed in the previous section.

To determine Tc we employ recent results relating the actual critical temperature at ﬁnite chemical potential to the
(pseudo)critical temperature of Lattice QCD at zero chemical potential by a a factor 0.94 ± 0.01 [2]. This information,
combined with latest accurate results on Polyakov loop and strange quark susceptibilities at zero chemical potential
[17], restricts the value of the critical endpoint temperature in the range 160 MeV < Tc < 165 MeV. Here we will
use the value Tc = 163 MeV as a representative one. Furthermore, for determining the amplitude ξ0,+ we assume
that the correlation length at T = 2Tc is signiﬁcantly smaller than the proton radius 1.25 fm, using indicatively the
value ξ(2Tc) = ξ0,+ ≈ 1
2 fm. With this choice we can ﬁnd, for diﬀerent nuclear systems, the temperatures T± which
determine the upper (+) and lower (−) limits of the FSS region along the temperature axis, compatible with the Ising-
QCD partition function (1). The results are summarized in Table I, where the transverse size of the corresponding
nuclei (in fm) is also given:

Thus, T+ and T− deﬁne a temperature zone where the critical scaling of baryon number density-density correlation
in conﬁguration space is transferred to an analogous scaling for small transverse momenta diﬀerences and consequently
an intermittency eﬀect in proton transverse momenta is expected to occur. To observe such a behaviour in a system of
colliding ions, the temperature of the corresponding freeze-out state has to lie between these two limiting temperatures.
This conclusion complements the analysis of [1]. There, it has been shown the narrowness of the critical region in the
chemical potential direction (∆µb ≈ 5 MeV). Here, we show that the FSS region is narrow also along the temperature
direction and in fact even narrower for large systems.

IV.

ISING-QCD PHENOMENOLOGY IN THE FSS REGION

In this section we will develop a systematic phenomenological study of the FSS region related to the QCD critical
point based on two basic ingredients: (i) accurate measurements of the freeze-out parameters for a set of A+A systems
at speciﬁc collision energy, and (ii) an accurate measurement of φ2 for an A+A system at the same collision energy,
freezing out within the FSS region. Actually both requirements are partially fulﬁlled by existing experimental data
√
s = 17.2 GeV. Within these limitations, scaling behaviour
of the NA49 experiment (CERN-SPS) at collision energy
compatible with the presence of critical ﬂuctuations is observed in the factorial moments of proton transverse momenta
of the Si + ”Si”-system (central collisions) [5] while, for the same beam energy, the freeze-out parameters for the
systems C + C, Si + ”Si” and Pb + Pb have been determined in [20]. However, these measurements, and in particular
the φ2 measurement in Si + ”Si”, possess signiﬁcant statistical errors. To proceed, we will ﬁrst employ the results
of the measurements described previously, ignoring the experimental error of φ2. Exploiting these (experimental)
results we will be able to derive a series of predictions for measurements in the running ion collision experiments at
CERN (NA61/Shine) and BNL (RHIC-BES I). We will also discuss the impact of the error in φ2 on some of these
predictions.

A. Freeze-out parameters

The chemical potential µb and the temperature T of the freeze-out states generated by central C + C, Si + ”Si”
and Pb + Pb collisions at
s = 17.2 GeV are given in reference [20]. For completeness we show the corresponding
values in Table II, including also the result for the intermittency index φ2 measurement in the transverse momentum

µ = µ0 + µae−wµA

;

µ0 = 247.36 MeV, µa = 17.54 MeV, wµ = 0.01

(9)

Taking into account also the corresponding errors we obtain an upper and lower envelop in each case.

√

The expressions (8,9) can now be used to estimate the freeze-out parameters for the Be + Be, Ar + Sc and Xe
+ La central collisions at
s = 17.2 GeV in the NA61/SHINE experiment. We ﬁnd the results given in Table III:
To obtain the (T, µb)-values in Table III for the slightly asymmetric systems Ar + Sc and Xe + La we have used as
mass number A the mean between the mass numbers of the two colliding nuclei. The values for the various freeze-out
parameters are displayed graphically in Fig. 1(a,b). In Fig. 1a the blue circles represent the freeze-out temperature
for the central collisions of A+A systems in NA49 experiment (A=C, Si, Pb) while with red circles are shown the
predicted freeze out temperatures for A+A’ collisions in NA61/SHINE (A=Be, Sc, Xe). The central solid black line is
the ﬁt with eq. (8) while the two dashed lines are the lower and upper envelope obtained when taking into account the
experimental errors. Similarly in Fig. 1b the blue stars refer to the freeze-out chemical potential of the NA49 systems
while the red stars are predictions of the freeze-out chemical potential for the NA61/SHINE systems. The solid black
line is the ﬁt with eq. (9) while the dashed lines are upper and lower envelopes induced by the experimental errors.

Finally, reversing the way of thinking, eq. (8) can be used to determine the range of values for the mass number
A for which the condition T− ≤ T ≤ Tc is valid. This is a crucial information for ion collision experiments:
it
provides us with the relevant sizes of nuclei to form freeze-out states within the FSS region, if the colliding energy is
√

s = 17.2 GeV and the collisions are central. It is straightforward to obtain: 23 ≤ A ≤ 31.

B. The intermittency index φ2

As a next step we use the NA49 measurement of the intermittency index φ2 to locate the freeze-out state of the Si
+ ”Si” (central collisions at
s = 17.2 GeV) within the critical region of the QCD CEP. To achieve this we follow
the line of thinking introduced in [1] and summarized brieﬂy in the previous section. There are two conditions for a
freeze-out state of A+A ion collisions to lie within the critical region:

√

1. The freeze-out temperature T should obey T+ < T < T− for the given system’s size and

2. the FSS exponent ˜q (and therefore also the intermittency index φ2) characterizing the scaling of the mean baryon

number (cid:104)N (cid:105) ∼ M ˜q with the system’s size M should fulﬁl the condition: 3

4 < ˜q < 1.

If we ignore measurement uncertainties, both requirements are satisﬁed by the freeze-out state of central Si + ”Si”
s = 17.2 GeV since T = 162.2 MeV [20] (while for Si T− ≈ 161.8 MeV, T+ ≈ 166.3 MeV, see table I)

√

to [20] are given by the blue circles. The red circles are predictions for the freeze-out temperature of central A+A’ collisions
in NA61/SHINE experiment (
s = 17.2 GeV) estimated using eq. (8) (black solid line). The dashed lines are determined
by the experimental errors. (b) Similar to (a) but now for the freeze-out chemical potential. The existing data for NA49
A+A collisions [20] are shown by the blue stars while the red stars are predictions for the A+A’ collisions in NA61/SHINE

into account the experimental errors.

√

We can now employ the partition function (1) to determine all the pairs (ln ζ = µb−µc
kB Tc

|) within the FSS
region fulﬁlling the condition ˜q = 0.96. To this end we calculate (cid:104)N (cid:105) for a dense lattice in the (ln ζ, t)-plane and
we determine the points of the lattice for which (cid:104)N (cid:105) ∼ M 0.96 holds. In fact we ﬁnd all the (ln ζ, t) pairs within the
critical region which lead to (cid:104)N (cid:105) ∼ M ˜q with 0.955 < ˜q < 0.965. The results of this calculation are presented in Fig. 2.
The blue line in Fig. 2 is the line for which ˜q ≈ 0.96 (with an accuracy of 0.005). The Si + ”Si” freeze-out state in

with T (Si) the temperature of the Si + ”Si” freeze-out state. Thus, knowing Tc it allows for the determination of µc
and ﬁnally opens up the possibility to locate freeze-out states in Fig. 2. We will use the same Tc value as that in Table
I (Tc = 163 MeV) to calculate the critical chemical potential µc employing eq. (11) and achieve the placement of the
freeze-out states of running ion collision experiments on the plane presented in Fig. 2. Since t(Si) < 0, we have to
use the lower branch in eq. (11) obtaining µc = 257.9 MeV. We observe that this value is very close to the estimated
central value of the freeze-out chemical potential in the Ar + Sc system shown in Table III. The corresponding central
value for the freeze-out temperature (T = 160.9 fm) lies outside the FSS region. However, the experimental errors
for the freeze-out parameters are large enough to allow the entrance into the FSS region as a possibility for Ar + Sc.
More accurate measurements of the freeze-out parameters are clearly necessary. This holds for all freeze-out states
presented in Tables II and III. On the basis of the central values for (µb, T ) in Ar + Sc freeze-out state, the appearance
of an intermittency eﬀect in this system is not expected. On the other hand the freeze-out temperature of Ar + Sc
is very close to the corresponding T− ≈ 162 MeV. Therefore, assuming a smooth change of the scaling properties in
the freeze-out states departing slightly from the FSS region we expect that the intermittency eﬀect, valid within the
FSS region, becomes gradually distorted in a twofold way:

• It will occur only up to transverse momentum cells of linear size δp⊥ fulﬁlling δp⊥ ≈ 1
δx⊥

with δx⊥ a scale
set by the correlation length of the ﬁnite system. The later is expected to be a small fraction of its average
transverse size R⊥. Therefore, the intermittency eﬀect will gradually disappear with increasing distance from
the FSS region.

• The value of the associated intermittency index may be altered by boundary eﬀects.

This is in contrast to the behaviour expected to occur for a system freezing out within the FSS region. In this case
the intermittency eﬀect should appear as a power-law behaviour of the corresponding factorial moments valid up to
transverse momentum cells of linear size δp⊥ ≈ 1
with R⊥ the average transverse size of the ﬁreball. Furthermore,
R⊥
the intermittency index φ2 should be equal to the FSS exponent ˜q. Such a behaviour is indeed observed in the
intermittency analysis of the Si + ”Si” system [5] where the power-law behaviour is clearly valid up to transverse
momentum cells of linear size δp⊥ ≈ 30 MeV, corresponding to a length scale of 6.6 fm which is very close to R⊥
for Si (see Table I). Theoretically, for transverse momentum cells with size less than 1
we expect a saturation of
R⊥
the factorial moments to a constant value. This is also compatible with the behaviour seen in Si + ”Si”, since in
this region of M⊥ values the factorial moment, after the background subtraction, varies very little and the associated
errors are very large [5].

Having determined (µc, Tc) it is straightforward to calculate (ln ζ (A), t(A)) for the freeze-out states of all the systems
presented in Tables II and III. The resulting plot is presented in Fig. 3 and errors in both chemical potential as well
as temperature direction are included. In the following discussion we will focus on the central values of the freeze-out
parameters which are presented by the colored stars in the plot. In Fig. 3 we have also included the freeze-out state
of central Au+Au collisions with
s = 14.5 GeV generated in RHIC. For the corresponding freeze-out parameters we

II) or expected to be measured in the NA61/SHINE experiment (Table III). The freeze-out state of central Au + Au collisions

large and more accurate measurements are needed. The dashed lines (blue, green) present the boarders of the FSS region in
each case (Si + ”Si”, Ar + Sc).

use the analytic relations given in [21]. We observe that the central value lies outside the critical region. Notice that
no other freeze-out states from the RHIC BES-I program can ﬁt in this plot. The reason is that the critical region
is very narrow in the chemical potential direction, as explained in [1]. On the other hand the beam energy scan at
RHIC uses energy steps, which lead to chemical potential values diﬀerences which appear very large, compared to the
size of the critical region. Coming back to the NA61/SHINE experiment, we observe that, according to Table III, the
freeze-out state of the Xe + La system TXe = 158 MeV, µXe = 251 MeV is expected to lie outside the critical region
(central value). Similar arguments hold also for the Pb + Pb freeze-out state.

According to this analysis, the critical region can be explored by ion collisions at

s = 17.2 GeV with nuclei with
mass number 23 ≤ A ≤ 31. Concerning the Ar + Sc system at highest SPS energy we observe that the expected
freeze-out state (green star) for central collisions lies within the critical region but outside the FSS region, close to the
boundary. Thus, in an intermittency analysis in this system we expect a distortion of the scaling behaviour, along the
lines we have described in the previous paragraph. In peripheral Ar + Sc collisions at
s = 17.2 GeV the freeze-out
temperature could increase and the chemical potential is expected to remain close to the critical one since the colliding
energy does not change. This means that eventually the freeze-out state of peripheral Ar+Sc collisions could enter
into the FSS region. In Fig. 3 we omitted for clarity reasons the experimental errors which are very large, especially
in the freeze-out chemical potential, indicating the need of more accurate measurements for a safe prediction of the
CEP location. Concerning the uncertainty in φ2 of the Si + ”Si”, it should be noticed that assuming a value less
than 0.96, which is within the interval dictated by the experimental error, we observe a shift of the location of all
freeze-out states to lower values of ln ζ. In particular, for the limiting value φ2 = 0.75, the NA61/SHINE freeze-out
states of Ar + Sc and Xe + La collisions at
s = 17.2 GeV would lie outside the critical region. Thus, this relation
between the diﬀerent freeze-out states suggests that accurate φ2 measurements in NA61/SHINE could also restrict
the uncertainty of φ2 in Si + ”Si” system.

C. Global ﬂuctuations, higher order cumulants

Closing this section it is worth to discuss the possibility to observe critical ﬂuctuations using higher order moments
(cumulants) integrated over the entire phase space. Such global measures have been proposed in the literature
[4, 22, 23] as a tool to observe the CEP in ion collisions. In particular, the non-Gaussian kurtosis is expected to
depend very sensitively on the correlation length when approaching the critical point. As a consequence even a
mild maximum of the correlation length will be magniﬁed at the level of kurtosis [22]. Furthermore, it is predicted
that kurtosis should be negative close to the critical point [4]. These predictions support the occurrence of a sharp

minimum in kurtosis as a function of the ion colliding energy and this strategy in the search for the CEP was adopted
by the STAR experiment within the framework of the BES-I program at RHIC [3]. In [24] an extensive analysis of the
STAR data on kurtosis times variance κσ2, along the lines dictated by the Ising-QCD partition function in eq. (1),
has been performed. It is argued that the occurrence of minima in kurtosis times variance of baryon number is not
a unique signature of the critical point. Furthermore, in [24] it has been argued that the quantity κσ2 is a good
candidate for the description of ﬂuctuations outside the critical region, while within the critical region the relevant
quantity is the kurtosis itself. In fact, this can be shown rigorously, employing a general grand-canonical description
of the partition function of the baryon system far from the critical point:

Z =

(cid:88)

N

eN ln ζ exp[−F (N, V, T )]

(12)

with ζ = µb−µc
are expressed as:

Tc

and V the system’s volume as in eq. (1). Then, all the higher cumulants Ck of the baryon number N

Ck =

∂k

∂(ln ζ)k ln Z ;

k = 2, 3, ..

(13)

is proportional to 1

as it can be proven easily by induction. Therefore, since ln Z (Gibbs free energy) is proportional to the volume V of
the system and ln ζ is an intensive quantity, the cumulants Ck are proportional to V . Consequently, non-Gaussian
kurtosis κ = C4
V and κσ2 (with σ2 = C2) is a size independent quantity. This description
C2
2
breaks down in the critical region due to the anomalous scaling in eq. (3). There, κ itself is size independent and it
should be used as a measure of ﬂuctuations for freeze-out states within the FSS region. In fact, the baryon number
kurtosis, within the Ising-QCD description, has been calculated in [24] and it has been shown that it possesses a
very sharp minimum, becoming at the same time negative, in accordance with the theoretical expectations discussed
above. However, the width of this minimum in the beam energy direction is extremely tiny. This is related to the
narrowness of the critical region along the chemical potential direction. Thus, since the BES-I program at RHIC
explores the QCD phase diagram in the (µb,T ) plane with minimal step-size ∆µb ≈ 50 MeV it is very unlikely to
detect ﬂuctuations characterizing the critical region which has a size of ≈ 5 MeV along the baryochemical potential
axis.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have performed a detailed phenomenological study of the critical region around the QCD critical endpoint
using two basic tools: measurements of the freeze-out parameters for central ion collisions at
s = 17.2 GeV and
measurements of the corresponding intermittency index φ2 using proton transverse momenta at midrapidity. Our
analysis, based on the connection of intermittency in transverse momentum space with the FSS in conﬁguration
space, as revealed in [1], leads to an estimate of the critical chemical potential value µc ≈ 258 MeV and a series
of predictions for expected experimental results in eventual measurements of the intermittency index φ2 in running
experiments.

√

Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the freeze-out chemical potential of the Ar + Sc system (central collisions at

s = 17.2
GeV) is expected to lie very close to the critical chemical potential. However, the corresponding freeze-out temperature
will lie outside the FSS region suppressing the intermittency phenomenon in transverse momentum space. This is due
to the fact that the FSS region is very narrow along the temperature axis. This is a crucial observation complementary
to the one made in [1]: there, it has been shown that the critical region is very narrow along the baryochemical
direction. Here we have shown that the ﬁnite-size scaling region, subdomain of the critical region, is very narrow also
along the temperature direction. This makes the φ2-measurement in Si + ”Si” collisions at the NA49 experiment of
exceptional importance, since this process appears to freeze-out within the FSS region. Very accurate measurements
of φ2 in central Si + ”Si” collisions at
s = 17.2 GeV could provide us with invaluable information concerning the
location of the CEP.

√

Furthermore, we emphasize that the scheduled energy variation in the BES-I program at RHIC, leading to steps
of at least 50 MeV along the chemical potential axis, cannot capture the conditions necessary for the entrance into
the critical region with a size of ≈ 5 MeV in µb direction [24]. Thus, to produce freeze-out states within the critical
region, a high resolution for the freeze-out chemical potential is required, which can only be achieved using colliding
nuclei of varying size.

According to our analysis, potentially promising measurements for observing critical ﬂuctuations are linked to
peripheral Ar + Sc collisions in the NA61/SHINE experiment at maximum SPS energy. Accurate measurements of

√

the freeze-out state parameters and the intermittency index φ2 in these collisions, as well as in systems with mass
number 23 ≤ A ≤ 31, are of high priority.
