Recent neutrino oscillation experiments used high atomic number nuclear targets

to attain suﬃcient interaction rates. The use of these complex targets introduced

systematic uncertainties due to the nuclear eﬀects in the experimental observables

and need to be measured properly to pin down the discovery. Through this simula-

tion work, we are trying to quantify the nuclear eﬀects in the argon (Ar) target in

comparison to hydrogen (H) target which are proposed to be used at Deep Under-

ground Neutrino Experiment far detector and near detector, respectively. Generates

Events for Neutrino Interaction Experiments and NuWro, two neutrino event gen-

erators, are used to construct ﬁnal state kinematics. To quantify the systematic

uncertainties in the observables, we present the ratio of the oscillation probability

(P(Ar)/P(H)) as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy.

Keywords: Neutrino, uncertainties, ﬁnal-state interactions, survival probability, nu-

INTRODUCTION

The proposed Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neu-

trino oscillation experiment [1–4]. The primary scientiﬁc goal of this experiment is to make

precise measurements of the parameters governing neutrino oscillations and constraining the

CP violation phase in the leptonic sector [5]. Another scientiﬁc goal of the DUNE project is

the determination of mass hierarchy, either it is normal hierarchy (NH) or inverted hierarchy

(IH) which is not known yet from experiments of supernova physics [6], atmospheric neutrino

physics, and proton decay physics [7]. DUNE will have neutrino and anti-neutrino spectrum

(νµ( ¯νµ), νe( ¯νe), and ντ ( ¯ντ )) beam facility at Fermilab that will be characterized by a near

detector (ND) near the neutrino source at Fermilab and also by far detector(FD) at Sanford

Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota, USA. This will provide a baseline

facility of length 1248 km to study the matter eﬀect. Both the detectors will have Argon

(Ar) target material to observe the neutrino spectrum that will help to overcome various

systematic uncertainties. ND will be observing the un-oscillated neutrinos spectrum while

the FD will be observing the oscillated neutrinos spectrum. Precise energy measurement

of each ﬂavor at both the detectors is crucial for achieving the scientiﬁc goal planned for

the experiment. Oscillation probabilities as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy are

measured by comparing the events rate as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy at

both ND and FD detectors, which are used to constrain values of the neutrino oscillation pa-

rameters and also proton lifetime measurement. These uncertainties cause major challenges

in the determination of the CP-violating phase which is yet to be constrained. Precise CP

phase value is not only crucial for verifying the baryon asymmetry of the universe but also

for explaining physics beyond the standard model and eﬀective mass of neutrinos [8].

Neutrinos are weakly interacting massive (extremely tiny mass) particles that interact

very rarely with matter. Due to its weakly interacting nature, it is very hard to detect them

in ordinary detectors. The detector thus proposed by DUNE collaboration is an extremely

advanced detector of this generation compared to other baseline neutrino experiment detec-

tors. This multipurpose DUNE detector will have a modular structure and each module has

diﬀerent technology. Each detector will be capable of detecting neutrino events and other

rare phenomena. Neutrino interacts with the charged current(CC) and neutral current (NC)

processes. Interaction event with the CC process produces leptons ( e+, e−, µ+, µ−, τ +, τ −)

corresponding to the neutrino ﬂavors (νe, ¯νe, νµ, ¯νµ, ντ , ¯ντ ) and hadrons in the ﬁnal states.

Interaction events with the NC produce the same neutrino ﬂavor and hadrons in the ﬁnal

states. Those processes are not considered in our MC sample. Recent neutrino experiments

are using a material with a high atomic number as detector materials in order to increase

the interaction rates and that further adds systematic uncertainty in neutrino energy re-

construction due to nuclear eﬀects. Major nuclear eﬀects present in the nuclear targets

are, uncertainties from the binding energy, multinuclear correlation, nuclear Fermi motion

eﬀects, and ﬁnal-state interactions (FSI) of produced hadrons in diﬀerent interaction chan-

3

nels. The requirement for accurate knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters depends

on many factors among which precise reconstruction of neutrino energy is of utmost im-

portance. The neutrino oscillation probability itself relies on the energy of the neutrinos,

and any inaccuracy of measurement of neutrino energy will be disseminated to the measure-

ments of neutrino oscillation parameters, since it causes uncertainties in the cross-section

measurement and event identiﬁcation. These kinds of systematics can be constrained by

using a simple targeted neutrino-hydrogen (H) scattering (ν(¯ν) − H) data.

Besides, the uncertainties in the total neutrino cross-sections which adds systematic un-

certainties in the observables [9], the secondary particles that come out of the nucleus after

the FSI also count up to systematic errors [10, 11]. One of the main reasons is that the nu-

cleons are neither at rest nor non-interacting inside the target nucleus. The intense neutrino

beams in recent experiments resulted greatly in an increase of statistics and decrease the

statistical uncertainty. Now, these experiments appeal to the careful handling of systematic

uncertainties. In this generation, neutrino experiments are using a complex nuclear target for

interaction that result in sizeable and non-negligible nuclear eﬀects. In most of the neutrino

experiments, the nuclear eﬀects are taken into consideration by Impulse Approximation [12]

or Fermi Gas Model [13] when simulating neutrino scattering events. Recent experiments

believe that nuclear eﬀects need to be modeled carefully after looking at experimental results

of diﬀerent neutrino experiments at diﬀerent energy ranges. Neutrino experiments that used

lower energy neutrino beams like MiniBooNE [14] and MicroBooNE [15] are sensitive to only

two types of neutrino interactions i.e. Quasi-Elastic (QE) and Resonance (RES). The pion

production in these experiments makes up only 1/3 of the total neutrino-nucleon interaction

cross-section. As we move towards the higher energy neutrino beam experiments such as

NOvA, MINERvA, and DUNE, the pion production increases to two-third of the total cross-

section [16]. Thus, it is important to measure the pion production channels carefully under

good and quantitative control. One of the most important nuclear eﬀects that gives rise to

wrong events is due to the FSI of hadrons which are produced in the reaction along with

leptons [17]. The pions which are produced in neutrino-nucleon interactions while traveling

inside the nucleus, can be absorbed, can change direction, energy, charge, or even produce

more pions due to various processes like elastic and charge exchange scattering with the

nucleons that exist in the nucleus through strong interactions. This leads to wrong number

of events depending on the emerging particles from the nucleus.

The paper is organized in the following sections: the neutrino event generators GENIE

and NuWro used in this work including a detailed comparison of the nuclear models incor-

porated in them are described in Section II. The experimental details and simulations are

described in Section III, the results, and the discussion are described in Section IV. Finally,

our conclusions are presented in Section V.

II. EVENT GENERATORS: GENIE AND NUWRO

Event generators are used to generate the events for the detectors to perform the

simulation-based results for any experiments to get an idea about the expected observ-

ables. Neutrino communities have their own event generators that have inbuilt models that

are tuned based on experimental data and generators work as a bridge for experimental and

theoretical physicists. We have selected the two most common neutrino event generators:

Generates Events for Neutrino Interaction Experiments (GENIE) v-3.0.6 [18] and NuWro

[19] version 19.01 to perform our studies that are currently being used by most of the neu-

trino experiments in the USA and other countries. GENIE is being used by many neutrino

baseline experiments running around the world, such as Minerva [20], MINOS [21], Micro-

BooNE [14], NOvA [22], and ArgoNEUT [23] experiments. NuWro has been developed by

a group of physicists Cezary Juszczak et. al. at the Wroclaw University [19] and is now

being used as a complementary neutrino events generator by most neutrino experiments.

GENIE has been developed putting special emphasis on scattering in the energy region of

few GeV, important for ongoing and future oscillation studies experiments, while NuWro

covers the neutrino energy scale from ∼ 100 MeV to ∼ 100 GeV. The basic architecture of

NuWro follows better known MCs like NEUT [24] or GENIE [18]. It operates all types of

interactions important in neutrino-nucleus interactions as well as Deep Inelastic Scattering

(DIS) hadronization and intranuclear cascade. NuWro serves as a tool to estimate the rele-

vance of various theoretical models being investigated now. GENIE is a modern and ﬂexible

platform for neutrino events simulation.

In this section, we will go over the qualitative theoretical diﬀerences in nuclear models,

as well as how neutrino-nucleus interaction processes are accounted for in both generators

and some popular approaches to neutrino-nucleus interaction analysis. In GENIE, the Rela-

tivistic Fermi gas (RFG) model is used which is based on the model suggested by A. Bodek

5

and J.L. Ritche [25] while in NuWro, Local Fermi gas (LFG) is used as a nuclear model.

Modeling of QE scattering is according to Llewellyn Smith model [26] in both the genera-

tors. Also the latest BBBA07 [27] and BBBA05 [28] vector form factors are used by GENIE

and NuWro, respectively. GENIE uses a variable value of axial mass MA between 0.99 - 1.2

GeV /c2 while NuWro uses a variable value of axial mass between 0.94 - 1.03 GeV /c2. In our

work, we have used axial mass MA = 1 GeV /c2. GENIE considered ∆ contribution as well

as other resonance modes individually based on Rein-Sehgal model [29] however, in NuWro

we have only ∆ contribution and for the rest of resonance modes, we have an average based

on Adler-Rarita-Schwinger model [30] for RES events. For DIS events, NuWro employs

Quark-Parton model [31] while GENIE uses Bodek and Yang model [32].

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS AND SIMULATIONS

DUNE at Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) will consist of ND and FD with same

target material, but the diﬀerence is in dimensions and technology. The ND system will be

located at Fermilab, 574 m downstream and 60 m underground [5] from the neutrino beam

source point.

The baseline design of the DUNE ND [2] system comprises of three main components: (1)

A 50t LArTPC called ArgonCube with pixellated readout; (2) A multi-purpose tracker, the

high-pressure gaseous argon TPC (HPgTPC), kept in a 0.5T magnetic ﬁeld and surrounded

by electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), together called the multi-purpose detector (MPD);

(3) and an on-axis beam monitor called System for on-Axis Neutrino Detection (SAND).

SAND [1] will consist of an ECAL, a superconducting solenoid magnet, a thin active LAr

target, a 3D scintillator tracker (3DST) as an active neutrino target, and a Low-density

tracker to precisely measure particles escaping from the scintillator. The FD (and the

similar ND) has to be made of heavy nuclei rather than hydrogen that is the main source of

complication. The primary goal of SAND is constraining systematics from nuclear eﬀects.

For a better understanding of nuclear eﬀects in neutrino-nucleus interactions, it is useful

to examine what would happen if the detectors will be made of hydrogen because in a

detector made of hydrogen, the initial state is a proton at rest and there is no FSI. The

40 kt DUNE FD will comprise of four separate LArTPC detector modules, each with a

ﬁducial volume (FV) of at least 10 kt, installed ∼1.5 km underground at the SURF [33].

6

The internal dimensions 15.1 m (w) × 14.0 m (h) × 62.0 m (l) of each LArTPC ﬁts inside

an FV containing a total LAr mass of about 17.5 kt. Detailed detector simulation and

reconstruction analysis is done by the DUNE-collaboration that can be found in detail in

references [5, 34]. We have applied the same detector eﬃciency from ﬁgure 4.26 of Ref. [34]

and energy resolution 18% for muon and 34% for hadrons for the particles available in the

FSI while reconstructing the neutrino energy in our analysis.

We have used DUNE-ND νµ and ¯νµ ﬂux [35] having an energy range of 0.125-10 GeV

shown in Figure 1 and this ﬂux is also folded with the oscillation probability to get the ﬂux

at the FD site.

In this energy range, there is a mashing of several interaction processes

viz. QE, RES, DIS, and two particle-two hole or Meson Exchange Current (2p2h/MEC). In

order to do our analysis, we have generated an inclusive event sample of 1 million νµ( ¯νµ)-Ar,

and νµ( ¯νµ)-H using both GENIE and NuWro event generators. In our analysis, we took into

account all of these interaction mechanisms.

Figure 1: The DUNE ﬂux as a function of neutrino energy used in our work.

The oscillation probability used here is represented by equation 1 and the true set of values

of the oscillation parameters [5] considered in this analysis are presented in Table I. One

can see that the oscillation parameters and neutrino energy are involved in the oscillation

probabilities equation. The uncertainties in the measured neutrino energy directly translate

into uncertainties in oscillation parameters. The oscillation probability of νµ → νe channel

through matter for the three-ﬂavor scenarios and constant density approximation is written

calorimetric method of neutrino energy reconstruction demands information of all the de-

tectable ﬁnal state particles on an event by event basis i.e. total of the energy deposited

by all reaction products in the detector and thus permitting for precise reconstruction of

neutrino energy. It is appropriate to all types of events, unlike the kinematic method which

is only applicable for QE event reconstruction. Still, this method gives rise to challenges

in the way of true neutrino energy reconstruction. The main challenges are the precise

reconstruction of all produced hadrons, where neutrons are assumed to escape detection

ν-Ar (upper panel) and ¯ν-Ar (lower panel) at ND, without oscillations and at the FD, with

the reconstructed neutrino energy is very well reconstructed using the calorimetric method

for both the generators.

In order to measure the impact of systematic uncertainties arising due to nuclear eﬀects

in neutrino energy reconstruction, we have taken the ratio of Muon (anti)neutrino survival

a lot of ﬂuctuations at lower energy. We also note two sharp peaks, one around 0.5 GeV and

another around 2.7 GeV. The ratio of P(Ar)/P(H) calculated as a function of true neutrino

energy (shown by blue stars) shows less ﬂuctuations as compared to the ratio calculated

with reconstructed neutrino energy (shown by red stars). Similar analysis is also performed

version (v3.0.6) of GENIE are better than the older version (v2.12.10) of GENIE.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We should have a good understanding of the hadronic physics of neutrino-nucleus inter-

actions since it is critical to understand nuclear eﬀects. The information about the energy

dependence of all exclusive cross-sections and nuclear eﬀects is important for the construc-

tion of any nuclear model. Any ignorance of theoretical uncertainties in the nuclear models

while simulating results cost inaccuracy. We use diﬀerent event generators, which are built

upon diﬀerent nuclear models to test results from the neutrino oscillation experiments.

Figure 8 shows that the nuclear models of the two most extensively used neutrino event

generators, GENIE and NuWro, have non-negligible systematic inaccuracies, especially in

the energy range of 1-3 GeV. To augment our knowledge of the poorly understood nuclear

eﬀects, a study of high-statistics ν-H scattering data is required. Through our work, we may

conclude that for long-baseline neutrino experiments like DUNE a multi-target approach

might be useful to reduce nuclear eﬀects.
