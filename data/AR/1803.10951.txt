The proton-unbound argon and chlorine isotopes have been studied by measuring trajectories
of their decay-in-ﬂight products by using a tracking technique with micro-strip detectors. The
proton (1p) and two-proton (2p) emission processes have been detected in the measured angular
correlations “heavy-fragment”+p and “heavy-fragment”+p+p, respectively. The ground states of
the previously unknown isotopes 30Cl and 28Cl have been observed for the ﬁrst time, providing the
1p separation energies Sp of −0.48(2) and −1.60(8) MeV, respectively. The relevant systematics of
1p and 2p separation energies have been studied theoretically in the core+p and core+p+p cluster
models. The ﬁrst-time observed excited states of 31Ar allow to infer the 2p-separation energy S2p
of 6(34) keV for its ground state. The ﬁrst-time observed state in 29Ar with S2p = −5.50(18) MeV
can be identiﬁed either as a ground or an excited state according to diﬀerent systematics.

INTRODUCTION

The location of the driplines — the borderlines sepa-
rating particle-stable and particle-unstable isotopes — is
one of the fundamental questions of nuclear science. The
unbound states with small decay energy can have life-
times which are long enough to be treated as quasista-
tionary states. Thus they may be considered as station-

∗ D.Kostyleva@gsi.de

ary states in many theoretical applications. This nat-
urally leads us to the question: what are the limits of
nuclear structure existence? In other words, how far be-
yond the driplines the nuclear structure phenomena fade
and are completely replaced by the continuum dynam-
ics? This question represents a motivation for studies of
nuclear systems far beyond the driplines.

The proton and neutron driplines have been accessed
for nuclides in broad ranges of Z (number of protons) and
N (number of neutrons) of the nuclear chart. However,
even in these regions the information about the nearest
to the dripline unbound isotopes is scarce and often miss-

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

ing. Thus the fundamental question about the limits of
the nuclear structure existence remains poorly investi-
gated. For example, if we consider the proton dripline
within Z ≤ 20 (p- and sd-shell nuclei), the most exten-
sively investigated case in that region is the ﬂuoride iso-
tope chain. Here our knowledge extends three mass units
beyond the proton dripline: the 15F and 16F nuclides are
well studied, and considerable spectroscopic information
is available now for 14F [1] in addition.

This paper continues our analysis of the data on reac-
tions with a relativistic 31Ar beam populating particle-
unstable states [2–4]. The article [2] was focused on 30Ar
and 29Cl isotopes which were reported for the ﬁrst time.
It was also found that the decay mechanism of 30Ar is
likely to belong to a transition region between true 2p
and sequential 2p decay mechanisms. Such a “transition
regime” exhibits strong sensitivity of observed kinematic
variables to the values of parameters deﬁning the decay
mechanism: 2p-decay energy ET , ground state (g.s.) res-
onance energy in the core+p subsystem Er, and its width
Γr. The practical implementations of this fact, including
opportunity of a precise determination of Γr from the 2p
correlation data, were recently elaborated in Ref. [3]. In
paper [4] a detailed consideration of the data from [2] was
given.

In present work we report on the byproduct data of
the same experiment which resulted in Refs. [2–4], which
include observation of 28Cl and 30Cl ground states and
several (presumably excited) states in 29Ar and 31Ar. In
order to clarify the situation with the observed states, we
have performed systematic studies of separation energies
in the chlorine and argon isotope chains. The depth of
the performed “excursion beyond the proton dripline” in
the argon and chlorine isotope chains is similar now in
extent to that for the ﬂuorine isotope chain, the best-
studied case in the whole Z ≤ 20 nuclei region.

II. EXPERIMENT

In the experiment, described in detail in Refs. [2, 4],
the 31Ar beam was obtained by the fragmentation of a
primary 885 AMeV 36Ar beam at the SIS-FRS facility at
GSI (Germany). The prime objective of the experiment
was study of 2p decays of 30Ar isotopes. The scheme
of the measurements is shown in Fig. 1 (a). We brieﬂy
repeat the general description of the experiment and the
detector performance given in Ref. [4] in detail.

The FRS was operated with an ion-optical settings in
a separator-spectrometer mode, when the ﬁrst half of the
FRS was set for separation and focusing of the radioac-
tive beams on a secondary target in the middle of the
FRS, and the second half of FRS was set for detection of
heavy-ion decay products. The 620 AMeV 31Ar ions with
the intensity of 50 ions s−1 were transported by the ﬁrst
half of the FRS in order to bombard a 9Be secondary tar-
get located at the middle focal plane S2. At the ﬁrst focal
plane S1 of the FRS, an aluminum wedge degrader was

FIG. 1. Sketch of the experiment at the FRS fragment sep-
arator. (a) General layout, see details in [4]. Primary 36Ar
beam hits a target at S0, and a secondary beam of 31Ar is
selected and focused on the middle focal plane S2 by using a
wedge degrader at S1. Nuclei of interest 31Ar∗, 29Ar are pro-
duced in the secondary target at S2 in in-elastic scattering
and two-neutron knock-out reactions. Heavy-ion decay prod-
ucts 29,27S are identiﬁed by their energy-loss and time-of-ﬂight
as well as the magnetic rigidity by using the standard beam
detectors at S2 and S4. At S4, the studies of stopped ions
can be performed by using Optical Time Projection Chamber
OTPC. (b) The detector setup downstream of the secondary

installed in order to achieve an achromatic focusing of
31Ar at the secondary target. In the previously reported
data [4] the 30Ar nuclei were produced via one-neutron
(−1n) knockout from the 31Ar ions. The decay products
of unbound 30Ar were tracked by a double-sided silicon
micro-strip detector array placed just downstream of the
secondary target, see Fig. 1 (b). The projectile-like parti-
cles, outgoing from the secondary target, were analyzed
by the second half of the FRS, which was operated as
a magnetic spectrometer. The magnet settings between
the S2 and S4 focal planes were tuned for the transmis-
sion of the targeted heavy ion (HI) fragments (e.g., 28S)
down to S4, the last focal plane. In addition to 30Ar, the
studies of decay properties of the stopped 31Ar ions were
performed by using the OTPC detector at S4 [5].

A double-sided silicon micro-strip detector (DSSD) ar-
ray consisted out of four large-area DSSDs [6] was em-
ployed to measure hit coordinates of the two protons and
the recoil heavy ions, resulting from the in-ﬂight decays
of the studied 2p precursors. The high-precision posi-
tion measurement by DSSDs allowed for reconstruction
of all fragment trajectories, which let us to derive the
decay vertex together with an angular HI-p and HI-p-p
correlations. For example, the trajectories of measured
28S+p+p coincidences were a basis for the analysis and
the concluded spectroscopic information on 30Ar [4].

the 2p-decay events have the same decay energy. The data

-tilted diagonal dash-dot line.

However, a number of by-product results were obtained
in a similar way from the data recorded in the same ex-
periment. Namely, excited states of 31Ar were populated
by various inelastic mechanisms, and 29Ar spectrum was
populated in two-neutron (−2n) knockout reaction. The
unbound 31Ar and 29Ar states were detected in triple
29S+p+p and 27S+p+p coincidences, respectively, see the
respective angular correlation plots in Figs. 2 and 3. The
relative angles there and everywhere below are presented
in milliradian units (mrad). Also the states of 28Cl and
30Cl can be populated both in the fragmentation of 31Ar
and as the result of proton emission from the correspond-
ing 31,29Ar isotopes. These mechanisms have lower cross
sections, and the obtained results have less statistics, see
the respective angular p-HI correlation plots in Figs. 9
and 6. In spite of poor statistics with few events regis-
tered, we have obtained several nuclear-structure conclu-
sions from the experimental data.

A. How nuclear-structure information can be
obtained from proton-ion angular correlations

Before the data analysis presentation, we remind the
reader, how nuclear-structure information concerning the
nuclei involved in a 1p or 2p decay can be obtained by
measuring only the trajectories of the decay products,
without measuring their kinetic energies. This approach
has been successfully tested in analyses of 1p, 2p decays
of the known states in 19Na, 16Ne and has been described
in details in Ref. [7].

For the discussion of 2p decays given below, let us con-
sider three diﬀerent mechanisms. These cases are illus-
trated in Fig. 4. The upper panels schematically show
the nuclear states involved in 2p decay of nucleus with
mass number A, the lower panels show the corresponding
momentum correlations kp1-HI − kp2-HI, where HI corre-
sponds to the A−2 nucleus. In the ﬁrst case (a) of prompt
2p decay, sequential 2p emission should be energetically
forbidden. As both emitted protons should share 2p-

decay energy Q2p, their energy spectra are broad and
centered around the value of Q2p/2; consequently, the 2p
momentum-correlation plot should have the shape of an
arc, with a radius corresponding to the Q2p value and
with most of the counts lying in the peak indicated by
the dark spot in the lower panel of Fig. 4 (a). Note that
all momentum-correlation plots in Fig. 4 are symmetric
with the respect to the 45◦ line since the protons p1 and
p2 are indistinguishable.

The case (b) represents the sequential emission of two
protons through a narrow resonance in the intermediate
nucleus with A − 1. The proton energies are ﬁxed here,
and the kp1-HI−kp2-HI correlation plot should yield double
peaks as indicated by the black dots in the lower panel
of Fig. 4 (b).

The third 2p-decay mechanism is 2p emission from sev-
eral broad continuum parent states via a low-lying state
in A − 1, see Fig. 4 (c). This mechanism should reveal a
peak in the p-HI energy with the corresponding broad dis-
tribution along the narrow “slice” as shown in the lower
part of Fig. 4 (c).

In the present method, we measure only total HI mo-
mentum and relative p-HI angles in the transverse di-

rection. We register trajectories of all decay products
directly downstream from the secondary-reaction target.
Fig. 5 (b) shows the kinematics plot for the simple case
of isotropic and mono-energetic single-proton emission
from a high-energy heavy ion. Fig. 5 (c) shows the corre-
sponding distribution of laboratory p-HI opening angles,
θp-HI. The angular spectrum exhibits a sharp peak cor-
responding to the proton emitted almost orthogonal to
the HI momentum vector. Thus the maximum value of
θp-HI is directly related to the decay energy Qp of the
emitted proton.
In the same way, the kp1-HI − kp2-HI
momentum correlations for 2p decays (Fig. 5) can be re-
placed by the corresponding θp1-HI − θp2-HI correlations.
If the initial and ﬁnal states of p emission are narrow,
the width of a peak in the angular distribution is gov-
erned mostly by the angular straggling of the proton in
the secondary-reaction target. If those states are broad,
the width results from a convolution of the state’s width
with the proton angular straggling.

The cases, sketched in Figs. 4 and 5 represent ideal
cases. In reality, several proton branches may be present,
representing more than one of the cases, shown schemat-
ically in Fig. 5 (a), and leading to a complicated spectra
with several peaks. One can, however, clean up the spec-
tra and enhance e.g. transitions with the small Q2p-values
by gating on the small angles of θp1-HI and plotting the
spectrum of θp2-HI under this condition.

Another tool of data analysis is a kinematic variable

ρθ = qθ2

p1-HI + θ2

p2-HI ,

describing 3-body HI+p+p angular correlations. Since ρθ
is related to the energy sum of both emitted protons and,
therefore, to the Q2p of the parent state by the relation
Q2p ∼ ρ2
θ [8], one can obtain an indication of the parent
state and its 2p-decay energy by studying the distribution
of ρθ. In a case of the decay from the same state, two
protons share Q2p, and such events should be located
along a root-mean-square arc in an angular correlation
plot θp1-HI − θp2-HI. By gating on a particular ρθ arc, the
decay events from a certain 2p-precursor can be selected.
The ρθ distributions are very useful in the analysis of
2p-decay data since they produce the spectra with less
peaks and allow to gate on a speciﬁc excitation-energy
regions.

In all cases, detailed Monte-Carlo simulations are re-
quired in order to interpret the angular spectra quantita-
tively by taking into account the corresponding response
of the experimental setup. For example, the angular cor-
relation for ﬁxed energy decay must be ﬁrst calculated.
This predicted angular correlation is then compared to
the measured one. The resonance energy is obtained by
the best-ﬁt where the probability that the two distribu-
tions are identical has maximum value. In the same way,
limits for the width of a resonance can be obtained.

The above-described analysis procedure, where the
states observed in a 2p-precursor were investigated by
comparing the measured angular θ and ρθ correlations

We follow this procedure in the present work, and the
applied detector calibrations are taken from the previous
30Ar analysis of the same experiment [4].

B. The data analysis: unknown states in 29Ar and
28Cl

We begin from the analysis of the relatively simple
case of the measured 27S+p+p correlations presented
by the θp1-27S − θp2-27S and θ − ρθ plots in Figs. 3 and

prise just seven 2p-decay events, each being measured in
triple 27S+p+p coincidence. Each detected event pro-
vides two θp-27S and one ρθ values. Most of them are
very well focused around the locations at θ = 44 mrad or
ρθ = 84 mrad. These values correspond to the 1p-decay
of the 28Cl state with Er of about 1.6 MeV and to the
2p-decay of the 29Ar state with Q2p of about 5.5 MeV.
A cross-check of this conclusion is illustrated in Fig. 6(a)
where the angular correlations θp-27S projected from the
27S+p+p correlation plot [in Fig. 6(b)] are compared with
the “inclusive” θp-27S distribution obtained from the mea-
sured p-27S double-coincidence events. One may see that
the “inclusive” spectrum consists of relatively enhanced
peaks (1–3). The peaks (1) and (2) have the best-ﬁts
at the 1p-decay energies Er of 1.60(8) and 3.9(1) MeV,
respectively. They have been assigned as the ﬁrst- and
second-emitted protons from the 5.5 MeV state in 29Ar,
and their sum decay energy gives the total 2p-decay en-
ergy of 5.50(18) MeV.

The data-ﬁtting procedure is illustrated on the exam-
ple of the (1) peak at θ = 44 mrad in the p-27S correla-
tion in Fig. 7. This is the same procedure described in
details in Refs. [4, 7]. The best-ﬁt simulations obtained
for the in-ﬂight decay of 28Cl with the 1p-decay energy of
1.60 MeV describe the data quantitatively, and the ﬁg-
ure inset shows that the probability of the data matching
simulations is about 1. The full width at half maximum
of the probability distribution provides the evaluation of
the Er uncertainty.

There are two additional events in the decay patten
of the 5.5 MeV state in Fig. 6 (b) corresponding to the
inclusive peaks (3) and (4) in Fig. 6 (a). As the inclusive
peak (3) is much enhanced, we may speculate that it may
be an evidence on the second state in 28Cl, which is also
fed by the other unspeciﬁed reaction channels, illustrated
in Fig. 4(c). The best-ﬁt 1p-decay energy of the peak (3)

In addition, there are indications on 27S+p+p corre-

have the second-emitted proton energy of 1.6 MeV, which
corresponds to the lowest assigned state in 28Cl.

The derived decay scheme and levels of 29Ar and 28Cl

are shown in Fig. 8.

We argue below in Section III, that our empirical as-
signments are backed by the isobaric mirror symmetry
systematics and that the most probable interpretation of
the measured decay-product correlations is the observa-
tion of 28Cl ground state with Sp = -1.60(8) MeV and
the 29Ar excited state with S2p = -5.50(18) MeV.

C. The data analysis: unknown states in 31Ar and
30Cl

The 2p-decay pattern of 31Ar, derived from the
29S+p+p data, is more complicated. Several separated
regions with events, corresponding to the same 2p-decay
energy, can be distinguished at the low angles in Fig. 2,
which indicate diﬀerent states in 31Ar. The tentatively
selected arcs are labeled by the Roman numerals (i)–(iv).
The same event groups can be found in the angular θ −ρθ
correlation plot in Fig. 9 (c) derived for the assumed 31Ar

the angles θ = {26, 37, 43} mrad, which point to possi-
ble low-energy states in 30Cl. The ρθ projection indi-
cates several 2p-decay patterns in 31Ar with the centre-
of-gravity values at ρθ = {45, 53, 61} mrad.

dences is low, and the non-selective projections do not

                      
                      
                      
 
 
 
                      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
allow for a quantitative analysis. Thus we have used
the slice θ projections gated by the ρθ selected areas (i-
v) in Fig. 9 (a). These gated projections are shown in
Fig. 10 in the panels (i-v), respectively. Two additional
projections gated at very large ρ values are shown in the
panels (vi,vii). In analogy to the 29Ar analysis, the “in-
clusive” θp-29S distribution obtained from the measured
p-29S double-coincidence events is shown in the lowest
panel of Fig. 10. This inclusive distribution display the
same low-energy peak (1) at around 26 mrad as well
as the peaks (4,5), though evidence on the Fig. 9(c)-
indicated peaks at 37 and 43 mrad (marked as (2) and
(3), respectively) is weak.

Similarly to the 28Cl case, the MC simulations of the
well-distinguished peaks (1,4,5) in the lowest panel of
10 by the experimental-setup response have re-
Fig.
sulted in assigning of the unknown 30Cl states with the
1p-decay energies Er of 0.48(2), 2.00(5) and 3.0(2) MeV,
respectively. On the basis of the performed analysis, the
0.48(2) MeV peak is assumed to be the ground state of
30Cl. Such an assignment is supported by the observed
29S+p+p correlations where one of the emitted protons
has relatively large energy and another proton’s energy
is peaked at around 0.5 MeV, see Fig. 10(vii). This is
a typical situation for a ﬁnal-state interaction due to the
30Cl g.s. resonance, see illustration in Fig. 4(c).
By using the parameters of the 30Cl g.s.

one may
obtain the 2p-decay energy of the lowest-energy state in
31Ar observed in the 29S+p+p correlations, see Fig. 10(i).
We have ﬁtted the θ projection (i) by a sequential proton
decay of 31Ar via the g.s. of 30Cl, and the obtained value
of 2p-decay energy is 0.95(5) MeV. Though the pattern
centered at ρθ = 35 mrad has low statistics, it is very
important for an overall interpretation of the data, as it
highly likely corresponds to the 31Ar ﬁrst excited state.
Thus we may lay the ﬁrst piece into the puzzle of the
31Ar excitation spectrum and its 2p-decay scheme whose
complete reconstruction is shown in Fig. 11 and which is
explained in a step-by-step way below.

• Namely, the gated θ projections in Fig. 10 (ii) and
(iii) exhibit the same peak (3) at 43 mrad, which
point to the sequential 2p decays of these 31Ar
states via the same state in 30Cl. The peak (3)
is best-ﬁtted by assuming the 1p decay of the 30Cl
state with Er=1.35(5) MeV. Then the 31Ar states
corresponding to the complementary bumps in the
structures (ii) and (iii) have the ﬁtted 2p-decay
energies of 1.58(6) and 2.12(7) MeV, respectively.
One should note that the projection (ii) provides
very broad and statistically poor signal from the
corresponding 31Ar state, which makes the assign-
ment very tentative, see Fig. 11.

• Next, the gated θ projections in Fig. 10 (iv) and
(v) reveal events matching the same 2.00 MeV peak
(4) in the inclusive spectrum in the lowest panel in
Fig. 10. They point to the sequential 2p decays of
two more states in 31Ar via the 2.00 MeV state in

which is complementary to the peak (4) in the pro-

 
 
 
 
 
 
8

jection (v) yields its energy of 1.56(10) MeV, and
together they allow for assignment of the new 31Ar
state with the 2p-decay energy of 3.56(15) MeV,
see Fig. 11. Interpretation of the θ projections in
Fig. 10 (iv) is more complicated, because it has the
additional components, and one of them matches
the peak (2) at 37 mrad due to a suspected state
in 30Cl.

• The contribution of such a state can be spot-
ted also in the θ projection (vi) in Fig. 10 as
well as in the “inclusive” θ distribution labeled
as (2). The corresponding ﬁts provide the 1p-
decay energy of 0.97(3) MeV assigned to the 30Cl
state. Then the whole structure of the θ dis-
tribution (iv) in Fig. 10 may be explained by
a sequential 2p-decay of one state in 31Ar by
two branches via the intermediate 0.97 and 2.00
states in 30Cl. The respective ﬁts provide two in-
dependent evaluations of the 2p-decay energy of
the 31Ar state of 0.97(3)+1.65(10)=2.62(13) and
2.00(5)+0.45(3)=2.45(8) MeV, respectively. They
agree within the statistical uncertainties. One may
note that the assigned 2p-decay branch via the
2.00 MeV state in 30Cl has the ﬁrst-emitted pro-
ton energy of 0.45(3) MeV, which coincides with
the 1p-decay energy of the g.s. of 30Cl. Therefore
the sequential 2p decay may proceed also via the
g.s. of 30Cl. These two assignments indistinguish-
able in our experiment are shown in Fig. 11 by the
dotted arrows. Due to this uncertainty, we accept
the 31Ar state to be at 2.62(13) MeV.

• Finally, the gated θ projection in Fig. 10 (vi)
with the assumed peak (2) due to the 0.97 MeV
state in 30Cl allows for identiﬁcation of the highest
state observed in 31Ar with the 2p-decay energy of
0.97(3)+3.2(2)=4.2(2) MeV.

• The only undiscussed peak (5) at about 65 mrad
in the “inclusive” θ distribution in the lowest panel
of Fig. 10 is also detected in the observed 29S-p-p
correlations, see Fig. 9(b). However, energy of an-
other emitted proton is distributed in a broad range
of energy, which points to a continuum region of
31Ar excitations above 5 MeV. Therefore the peak
(5) can not be assigned to an individual 31Ar state.
We may speculate that it probably belongs to the
3.0(2) MeV state in 30Cl which is strongly popu-
lated by de-excitation of high-energy continuum in
31Ar.

Summarizing the above considerations, we have as-
signed the 30Cl states with the decay energies Er of
0.48(2), 0.97(3), 1.35(5), 2.00(5) and 3.0(2) MeV. There
is also some indication that the structure around θ =
26 mrad may consist of two sub-structures at about 24
and 28 mrad (corresponding to the Er values of 0.48
and 0.55 MeV, respectively), which we will discuss below.

III. SYSTEMATICS FOR CHLORINE ISOTOPES

As a ﬁrst step in the interpretation of the data, we
would like to evaluate the energies of the states in proton-
rich chlorine isotopes systematically by using the known
information about their isobaric mirror partners. The
obstacle here is the Thomas-Ehrman shift (TES) eﬀect
[9, 10], especially pronounced in the s-d shell nuclei. The
systematics of orbital size variations for s- and d-wave
conﬁgurations are diﬀerent when approaching the pro-
ton dripline and beyond it. This leads to a signiﬁcant
relative shift of the s-wave and d-wave dominated states
distorting the expected (due to isobaric symmetry) nu-
clear level ordering in isotopes near the proton dripline.
The core+p cluster model is a reasonable tool for consid-
eration of this eﬀect.

The Coulomb displacement energies in the core+p clus-
ter model depend on two parameters: the orbital radius,
which is mainly controlled by the potential radius, and
the charge radius of the core. We use the potential with
a Woods-Saxon formfactor and with a conventional dif-

provided by the standard parameterizations

r0 = 1.2(Acore + 1)1/3 .

(1)

The charge radii of sulphur isotopes are poorly stud-
ied [11], so we use the extrapolation shown in Fig. 12.
Here we use two limits, corresponding to either ascend-
ing or descending trend near the dripline (both trends are
not excluded by the available systematics of the charge
radii). One should note that the 26S case is already un-
certain. This particle-unstable nuclide (expected to be a
2p-precursor [12]) has the valence-proton wave function
expected to well penetrate into the sub-barrier region.

Then the Coulomb potential of the charged sphere is

used with the radius parameter rsph,

sph = (5/3)[r2

where rch(p) = 0.8 fm. The potential parameters are
collected in Table I. The results of the calculations are
collected in Fig. 13. Below, we study the chain of ﬁve
chlorine isotopes 32−28Cl.

A.

31Cl and 32Cl cases

One can see in Fig. 13 (a,b), that for known isotopes
31Cl and 32Cl the used systematics of potential param-
eters given by Eqs. (1) and (2) provides level energies
which are overbound a bit (by ∼ 150 keV) in comparison
with the data. However, the general trend is well repro-
duced, thus the standard set of the parameters could be
the good starting point for the systematic evaluation of
the whole isotope chain.

B.

30Cl and 29Cl cases

Spectrum of 29Cl was discussed in details in [2, 4], see
Fig. 13 (d). The data on 30Cl spectrum is reported in
this work for the ﬁrst time. The spectra of these isotopes
can be reasonably interpreted only on the bases of the
strong TES eﬀect for some states. The calculated levels
shown in Fig. 13 (c) present evidence that two low-lying
structures in the spectrum of 30Cl (at 0.48(2) and 0.97(3)
MeV) can be associated with nearly-overlapping doublets
2+–3+ and 1+–3+. We assume that the 3+ g.s. in 30Al
has a d-wave structure. Then its doublet partner, the 2+
state is expected to be strongly shifted down by TES,
and therefore to become the 30Cl g.s. There is a hint in
the data shown in Figs. 9 and 10, that the “ground state
peak” in 30Cl at θ = 26 mrad actually consists of two
substructures, diﬀerently populated in the decays of sev-
eral 31Ar states. In this work, the 30Cl g.s. prescription is
based on the lower substructure with the corresponding
proton emission energy Er = 0.48 MeV.

Why the above-mentioned prescription is reliable? The
Thomas-Ehrman shift for the 30Al-30Cl g.s. pair is about
330 keV. If we assume that the 3+ g.s. in 30Al has an s-
wave structure, then the Thomas-Ehrman shift leads to
the evaluated energies Er = 50 − 150 keV of the 3+ g.s.
in 30Cl. For such low decay energies, the 30Cl g.s. should
live suﬃciently long time in order to “survive” the ﬂight
through the second achromatic stage of the FRS frag-
ment separator (of ∼ 150 ns). We don’t report such an
experimental observation. We may also assume a d-wave
structure of the 2+ and second 3+ states. However such
an assumption practically does not change the predicted
Sp energy of 30Cl, but it requires the existence of peaks
which are not seen in our data.

C.

28Cl case

A doublet of low-lying states can be found in the bot-
tom of 28Na spectrum, see Fig. 13 (e). Presumably, the
2+ and 1+ states are separated by just of ∼ 50 keV. The
1+ state can be only d-wave dominated, while 2+ can be
either s-wave or d-wave dominated. If both states have

a d-wave structure, then the 28Cl g.s. should be found
at about 2.4 MeV. In contrast, the observation of decay
events corresponding to Er = 1.60(8) MeV can be easily
interpreted as the s-wave g.s. of 28Cl with the predicted
energy of 1.77 − 1.84 MeV.

IV. SYSTEMATICS LOOK ON ARGON
ISOTOPES

After we have systematically investigated the behavior
of 1p separation energies for the chlorine isotopic chain,
we can turn to the systematic studies of the correspond-
ing argon isotopic chain, which is based on the obtained
information. Namely, we apply the systematics of odd-
even staggering (OES) energies which were shown to be a
very helpful indicator concerning the dripline systems in
our previous works [2, 12, 13]. The OES energy is deﬁned
as

2EOES = S2p − 2Sp .

The systematics of EOES is presented in Fig. 14. One
can see that the systematic trends are very stable for
the all considered isotopic chains. The EOES is always
smaller for the proton-rich systematics compared to the
neutron-rich one. The diﬀerence of 0.5 MeV is practically
the same value for all three cases, see the gray line in Fig.
14. EOES also systematically decreases with an increase
of mass number, which indicates a borderline of nuclear
stability. The EOES for 30Ar was found to be smaller
than the corresponding systematic expectation [2].
It
was argued in this work that such a deviation is typical
for systems beyond the dripline, which is conﬁrmed by
the examples of well studied 2p emitters 12O, 16Ne and
19Mg. Theoretical basis for such an eﬀect is provided
by the three-body mechanism of TES [14], which was
recently validated by the high-precision data and theo-
retical calculations in Ref. [15]. When extrapolating this
trend to the nearby isotopes, one may expect that 31Ar
should reside on the EOES systematics curve or slightly
below, while the 29Ar could be considerably below.

The excitation spectrum of 31Ar obtained in this work
demonstrates a very high level of isobaric symmetry in
respect to its mirror 31Al, see Fig. 11. Based on the
isobaric symmetry assumption, we can infer very small
value of the 2p threshold S2p = −3(50) keV for the g.s. of
31Ar. This value is obtained by a comparison of the 2p-
decay energy of 950(50) keV and the literature value of
946.7(3) keV of the excitation energy of the ﬁrst excited
state in 31Ar and its mirror 31Al [16], respectively. The
S2p value of 31Ar g.s. may be also obtained by a com-
parison of the aligned low-energy exited states in 31Ar
and 31Al. Namely, the states in 31Ar with 2p-decay en-
ergy of 1.580(60), 2.120(70) and 2.620(130) MeV match
the known excited states in 31Al [16] at excitation en-
ergy of 1.613(0.24), 2.090(11) and 2.676(28) MeV, re-
spectively. By assuming the same energy between the
g.s. and the respective excited state both in 31Ar and

31Al, we obtain more estimations of the g.s. of 31Ar: at
S2p = +33(60), −30(81), +56(158) keV, respectively.

The weighted mean of all four pairs provides the aver-
aged S2p value of +6(34) keV which we ﬁnally accept for
the g.s. of 31Ar. Our evaluation agrees within the exper-
imental uncertainties with the previously-estimated S2p
value of -3(110) keV obtained in beta-decay studies of
31Ar [17], and precision of the present result is improved
by the factor of 3. Our conclusion is that the 31Ar g.s. is
rather bound than not.

With the known value Sp(30Cl) = −0.48(2) MeV, we
can estimate the value 2EOES = 0.966(74) MeV for
31Ar, which is in a good agreement with the extrap-
olated OES energy trend in Fig. 14 (a), which gives
2EOES = 0.915 MeV. This is an additional argument in
favor of the isobaric symmetry (or very close to that) of
the 31Ar and 31Al ground states.

So, the 31Ar g.s. is evaluated to be likely bound with
the 2p separation energy of less than 40 keV. Even if
it is 2p-unbound (which can not be excluded by our re-
sults), its decay status is not aﬀected: for such a small
decay energy the 2p partial-lifetime of 31Ar is incompa-
rably longer than its β-decay lifetime. Then the g.s. of
31Ar can still be considered as a quasi-stable state in
many theoretical applications. An interesting issue here
could be the possible existence of the 2p-halo in such an
extremely lousy-bound proton-rich nuclide.

Now let us turn to the 29Ar system. As discussed
above, we expect the chlorine isotopes to be overbound
in comparison with their mirror isobars (relative to the
isobaric symmetry expectations) in a region beyond the
dripline because of the TES. For the argon isobars far
beyond the dripline, there should be a competition of
two trends. One is the overbinding because of TES
(the Coulomb displacement energy decreases because of
the increase of the valence orbital size). An opposite
trend is underbinding due to EOES reductions (the p-p
pairing energy decreases because of the increase of the
valence-proton orbital size). One must note that the ab-
solute value of extrapolated OES energy is quite low,
2EOES = 0.361 MeV [see Fig. 14 (c)]. As the nega-
tive or extremely small value of paring energy seems to
be unrealistic assumptions, we accept the following val-
ues {EOES, 2EOES} = {0.155, 0.361} MeV as the limits
of an OES energy variation. Then we obtain the value
S2p = −2.93(25) MeV for the g.s. of 29Ar by accepting
Sp = −1.60(8). According to this estimate, the state
observed in 29Ar at S2p = −5.50(18) MeV can not be
assigned as its ground state, and therefore it should be
one of the excited states in 29Ar. However, one should
note that this prediction based on the OES systematics is
not in accord with the other systematics and the results
of theoretical calculations available in the literature, see
Table II reviewing the published results on 29Ar. So, fur-
ther studies of the 29Ar system are required in order to
clarify the issue.

V. CONCLUSION

The new isotopes 29Cl and 30Ar were recently discov-
ered [2] and the spectroscopy of these two nuclei was

performed [4] with the reactions of 31Ar exotic beam at
620 AMeV energy on light target. In this work, we in-
vestigated the additional inelastic excitation and particle
knockout channels of those reactions. The main results
of this work are:
(i) Two previously-unknown isotopes, 28Cl and 30Cl,
which are unbound respective to the 1p emission have
been observed. The ground state energies of 28Cl and
30Cl have been derived by using angular 27,29S+p corre-
lations. In addition, four excited states of 30Cl have been
identiﬁed as the sub-systems of the previously-unknown
excited states of 31Ar. These states were populated by
inelastic excitation of secondary 31Ar beam and identiﬁed
by registering 29S+p+p correlations.
(ii) The ﬁrst-time observed excitation spectrum of 31Ar
matches very well the excitation spectrum of its isobaric
partner 31Al. The registered isobaric symmetry is used
in order to infer the position of the 31Ar ground state
at the 2p separation energy S2p = 0.006(34) MeV. The
high level of isobaric symmetry of these mirror nuclei is
conﬁrmed by the systematics of OES energies. The near-
zero value of S2p of 31Ar suggests speculations about the
possibility of 2p halo in this nuclide.
(iii) First evidence on a state in a previously-unobserved
isotope 29Ar has been obtained by detecting 27S+p+p
correlations. The state was found to be 2p-unbound with
S2p = −5.50(18) MeV. The results of the diﬀerent energy
systematics do not allow to clarify the status of the ob-
served state. It may be either an excited at ∼ 1 − 2 MeV
above the ground state (as estimated in this work) or it
may be a ground state of 29Ar according to Refs. [18–20].
This situation calls for further measurements.
