ABSTRACT

A GOES M1.9 ﬂare took place in active region AR 11153 on February 9, 2011. With the resolu-
tion of 200 kHz and a time cadence of 80 ms, the reverse-drifting (RS) type III bursts, intermittent
sequence of type U bursts, drifting pulsation structure (DPS), and ﬁne structures were observed by
the Yunnan Observatories Solar Radio Spectrometer (YNSRS). Combined information revealed by the
multi-wavelength data indicated that after the DPS which observed by YNSRS, the generation rate
of type U bursts suddenly increased 5 times than before. In this event, the generation rate of type U
bursts may depend on the magnetic reconnection rate. Our observations are consistent with previous
numerical simulations results. After the ﬁrst plasmoid produced (plasma instability occurred), the
magnetic reconnection rate increased suddenly 5-8 times than before. Furthermore, after the DPS, the
frequency range of turnover frequency of type U bursts is obviously broadened 3 times than before,
which indicates the ﬂuctuation amplitude of the density in the loop-top. Our observations also support
the numerical simulations during the ﬂare impulsive phase. The turbulence occurs at the top of the
ﬂare loop, the plasmoids can trap the non-thermal particles and cause the density ﬂuctuation at the
loop-top. The observations are generally consistent with the results of numerical simulations, helping
us to better understand the characteristics of the whole physical process of eruption.

Keywords: Solar ﬂare — Solar radio emission — Solar magnetic reconnection

1. INTRODUCTION

Magnetic reconnection is a common phenomenon in the solar atmosphere and it can occur in a slowly changing
way, which may contribute to coronal heating (e.g., Priest & Schrijver 1999), but more often happen as sudden violent
processes such as ﬂares, coronal mass ejections (CME), jet eruptions, etc (e.g., Lin & Forbes 2000; Cassak & Shay 2012).
Magnetic reconnection leads to plasma heating and particle acceleration, which in turn, can eﬃciently contribute to
chromospheric evaporation, thermal conduction fronts, and solar radio bursts during the solar eruption (e.g., Tian et
al. 2014; Ni et al. 2015, 2016, 2017; Hong et al. 2017, 2019; Cairns et al. 2018; Bi et al. 2020).

The energetic electrons are accelerated by magnetic reconnection, the instability of an electron beam can generate
Langmuir (plasma) waves at the local plasma frequency that can be converted into electromagnetic emission. Then
the electron beam propagates in upward direction (anti-sunwards) along open magnetic ﬁeld lines producing normal
type III solar radio bursts with a negative frequency drift rate. Cairns et al. (2018) provided the long-desired direct
evidence that electrons energized in magnetic reconnection regions to produce type III solar radio bursts. In contrast,
the energetic electrons propagate in downward direction (sunwards) to form the reverse-drifting (RS) type III bursts
with a positive frequency drift rate, as the energetic electrons move mirror in a closed magnetic ﬁeld line and show
ﬁrst a negative drift rate and later a positive drift rate after they crossed the loop apex, which appears shaped as
an inverted letter U, and thus are named type U bursts. In some cases, the energetic electrons are accelerated by
magnetic reconnection and reach the mirror point near the opposite footpoint of the ﬂare loop system, and then by
the magnetic mirror eﬀect, the energetic electrons moving along the loops and type U bursts are formed. A partial
type U burst which does not show a fully developed downward branch is named a J burst (e.g., Aschwanden et al.
1993; Wang et al. 2001; Ning et al. 2000, 2003; Kong et al. 2016). The physical relevance of type III and U bursts

is the diagnostics whether the electron beams propagate along open or closed magnetic ﬁeld lines (e.g., Aschwanden
2009).

The radiation mechanism of type III, U bursts, and their subtypes is usually considered as plasma radiation, which
produces radiation at the plasma frequency (or second harmonic frequency), and its square is directly proportional to
the electron density. Therefore, the coronal electron density distribution can be diagnosed by the frequency distribution
of type III, type U bursts, and their subtypes. Especially, the type III pair bursts occurring in ﬂare impulsive phase
have lower separate frequencies, indicates the plasma density of the magnetic reconnection energy release region (Tan
et al. 2016a,b). The coronal altitude of the magnetic reconnection region can be estimated by the coronal density
models (e.g., Aschwanden and Benz 1995).

In the numerical simulations of the magnetic reconnection in current sheet, Shen et al. (2011) found that the rate
of magnetic reconnection, MA, after the ﬁrst plasmoid generation was about 5 to 8 times higher than before. Similar
results were found in numerical simulations of Ni et al. (2018), their results also demonstrated after appearing the
plasmoid instabilities, the reconnection rate sharply increased by a factor of about 5 times. This phenomenon of
magnetic reconnection was not observed due to the limited resolution of observations.

In addition, the jets are usually considered to be the results of the plasma heated and accelerated by magnetic
reconnection and moving along open or large scale magnetic ﬁeld lines. Therefore, they often have straight or slightly
curved structures. The observations also show that there are lots of ﬁne structures and radio bursts in the process of
jets (e.g., Shen et al. 2011, 2012; Zhang et al. 2017; Shen et al. 2018).

2. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS

A GOES M1.9 class ﬂare in soft X-rays occurred in active region AR 11153 on February 9, 2011. The onset, peak
and end times are 01:23 UT, 01:28 UT and 01:31 UT, respectively. In the same time, several solar radio bursts and
ﬁne structures were observed by theYunnan Observatories Solar Radio Spectrometer (YNSRS, Gao et al. 2014a) and
Hiraiso Radio Spectrograph (HiRAS, Kondo et al. 1995).

The solar radio bursts occurred between 01:26 and 01:36 UT on February 9, 2011 and were detected by HiRAS, which
consists of three antennas, HiRAS-1, HiRAS-2, and HiRAS-3, which have the frequency ranges of 25−70, 70−500 and
500−2500 MHz with spectral resolution are 45 kHz, 430 kHz, and 2 MHz, respectively. Fig. 1 displays the dynamic
spectrum of this event obtained by HiRAS with a time cadence of 1 s. In the dynamic spectrum observed by HiRAS-3,
between 01:26:24 and 01:30 UT, some type III bursts with narrow band embellish over a group of decimetric radio
bursts (DCIM) occurred from 700 to 1500 MHz. Actually, these type III bursts observed by HiRAS are three groups
of type U bursts observed by YNSRS with the higher time and frequency resolution (see Fig. 2a). Fig. 1 also shows
the drifting pulsation structure (DPS) drifting from 440 MHz at 01:28:21 UT to 340 MHz at 01:28:45 UT, as well as
the two U bursts that are stringed together, these type U bursts occurred from 220 to 300 MHz observed by HiRAS-2
between 01:30:15 and 01:30:42 UT. The obvious radio storm, observed by HiRAS-1, occurred between 01:28:06 and
01:34:50 UT and the frequency range from 27 to 70 MHz.

The dynamic spectrum in the white box of Fig. 1 was also observed by YNSRS, which works in the frequency range
from 625 to 1500 MHz with the spectral resolution of 200 kHz and a time cadence of 80 ms. The frequency range of
800−975 MHz has no data because of the notch ﬁlters that suppress serious interferences in this band (see Gao et al.
2014a). The dynamic spectrum of the event obtained by YNSRS is plotted in the Fig. 2a between 01:26 and 01:30 UT
on February 9, 2011, which shows the reverse-drifting (RS) type III bursts, type U bursts, ﬁne structures, and DCIM
which were also observed by HiRAS. We assigned the type U bursts into three groups with the obvious time interval
of each group (Groups 1−3). These groups include 1 (01:26:42.280−01:26:42.920 UT), 6 (01:27:28−01:27:46 UT), and
16 (01:28:17−01:28:52 UT) type U bursts, respectively. We also note that it is hard to resolve type U bursts in Fig. 1,
therefore, if there is a lack of high-resolution data, these type U bursts may be usually considered narrow-band type
III bursts in previous observations. The continuous curve with yellow color in Fig. 2a is time derivative of GOES 1−8
˚A time series, which is used as a proxy for the missing HXR data because no RHESSI data at that time interval were
available. Around the peak of the ﬂare (∼01:28 UT), the Group 3 type U bursts have the largest number and the
fastest generation rate, meanwhile the rising and dramatic variability happened in the time derivative curve of GOES
1−8 ˚A time-series. In addition, the red curve in Fig. 2a is the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP, Nakajima et al.
1994) ﬂux plot at 1 GHz, which shows the maximum ﬂux density of these radio bursts is about 300 s f u.

In order to investigate the details of these radio bursts, we zoomed in each region of Fig. 2a, hence, Figs. 2b−2f
are corresponding to type RS bursts, groups 1− 3 type U bursts, respectively. Fig. 2b shows a group of type RS

Decimetric type U solar radio bursts

bursts between 01:26:24 and 01:26:38 UT. Combining the HiRAS-3 and YNSRS data revealed by Figs. 1 and 2b, we
found the type RS bursts drifting from 660 to 970 MHz with the drifting rate of 660 ±110 MHz s−1. The ﬁrst group
(Group 1) has one type U burst (No.1 see Fig. 2b), which is after the type RS bursts and starts at 01:26:42.280 UT,
as well as the time duration is about 640 ms. Both the beginning and ending frequency are 800 MHz, as well as the
turnover frequency is 766 MHz. Figs. 2c and 2d display the second group (Group 2) of the type U bursts (Nos.2−7),
which occurred between 01:27:28 and 01:27:46 UT. The Nos.2−4 and 6 have almost the same beginning, ending and
turnover frequency, which are 800, 800 and 766 MHz, respectively. The turnover frequencies of Nos. 5 and 7 are lower
than the others, which are about 740 and 700 MHz, respectively. Figs. 2e and 2f show the last group with 16 type U
bursts (Nos.8−23) between 01:28:17−01:28:52 UT, which is the largest number of type U bursts in this event. Some
enhancements between them are not included. Hence, 16 is a lower limit, possibly more type U bursts occurred in
this group. In addition, there are some ﬁne structures (FSs) in HiRAS and YNSRS data, such as drifting pulsation
structures (DPSs) (see Figs. 1 and 2e).

DPS is considered to be the radio signatures of plasmoids forming and moving during magnetic reconnection in the
impulsive phase of the ﬂare (e.g., Kliem et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2010; Gao et al. 2014b). In the numerical simulations of
magnetic reconnection, the emergence of plasmoids is considered to be a sign of plasma instability and turbulence (Shen
et al. 2011; Ni et al. 2015, 2016, 2017). Two DPSs in this event are displayed in Figs. 1 and 2e, respectively. HiRAS
observed the DPS with the center frequency drifting from 420 to 360 MHz, and the time interval is 01:28:21−01:28:45
UT, as well as the drifting rate is −3 ± 0.5 MHz s−1 (marked with ‘DPS’ in Fig. 1). The other DPS after No.9 type
U burst with the drifting rate of −6.2 ± 2.7 MHz s−1 observed by YNSRS occurred in the higher frequency, the center
frequency range is about from 728 to 712 MHz, and the time interval is about 01:28:23−01:28:25 UT (marked with
‘DPS-H’ in Fig. 2e).In addition, after the DPS of Fig. 1, the crowded two type U bursts occurred between 300 and
220 MHz observed by HiRAS-2 with the time interval of 01:30:18−01:30:36 UT, the turnover frequency is about 290
MHz.

Figs. 2c−2f display some FSs in type U bursts. Fig. 2c shows the No.5 type U burst which is superimposed over the
No.4. Both of them have almost the same turnover time (∼01:27:36 UT) but the diﬀerent turnover frequency, which
are 760 and 740 MHz, respectively. We also note that Nos. 10−18 type U bursts occurred after the ‘DPS-H’ observed
by YNSRS (see Fig. 2e and 2f), and their turnover frequencies are not concentrated in one point, but distributed in
a frequency range of ∼30 MHz (such as No.10 type U burst in Fig. 2f). In contrast, before the ‘DPS-H’, the turnover
frequencies of type U bursts Nos.1−9 are distributed in the range of ∼10 MHz (such as No. 9 type U burst in Fig.
2e).

2.1. Radio Data Analysis

The physical mechanism of type III and U bursts is considered to be plasma radiation. The energetic particle motion
in the coronal plasma with the velocity of 0.1−0.3 c causes the Langmuir instability and ﬂuctuation, and then the
corresponding energy is transferred to the electromagnetic wave with the same frequency at the local plasma frequency
and/or second harmonic frequency. Therefore, the frequency fobs of the observed radio bursts is related to the plasma
frequency fp and the electron density ne in the source region by fobs = sfp, fp [kHz] = 8.98(cid:112)ne [cm−3], and thus
to the altitude of the source region, if a coronal density model, ne=ne(h), is given. Here s stands for the fundamental
(s = 1) and for the harmonic (s = 2) band, respectively (McLean & Labrum 1985).

In this work, we use the electron density model of Aschwanden and Benz (1995) for the ﬂare region:

(cid:40)

ne(h) =

n1(h/h1)−p
nQ exp(−h/λ)

h < h1,
h > h1,

(1)

where h1 is a transition height at which the way ne depending on h changes. This model is constrained by the electron
density nQ at the base of the quiet corona and the density scale height λ. It was developed for the region that has
been aﬀected by the heating and chromospheric evaporation in the ﬂare process. A smooth transition between the
two regimes is obtained by requiring that the function and its ﬁrst derivative be continuous at the transition height
h = h1. These continuity conditions determine h1 and the density n1 = ne(h = h1):

h1 = pλ,

n1 = nQ exp(−p),

(2)

with p = 2.38, λ = 6.9 × 109 cm, and nQ = 4.6 × 108 cm−3.

Gao et al.

The type RS bursts were observed by YNSRS at the beginning of this event (see Figs. 2a and 2b), they indicated
the electron beams propagating in the sunward direction in contrast to the normal type III solar radio bursts. The
starting frequency of the type RS bursts is 695 ± 3 MHz, according to the altitude of the region of particle accelerated
by magnetic reconnection can be calculated by Equation (1), and is 20.6 ± 0.1 Mm (from the solar surface).

We investigated the radio data from YNSRS, the EUV data from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et
al. 2012) and LOS magnetograms from Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager (HMI, Schou et al. 2012) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). A newly emerging magnetic loop appeared below the existing magnetic loop at
01:25:45 UT in 131 ˚A band (see Fig. 4a). At 01:26:21 UT, a disturbance of EUV was observed, which moved from
one upper left footpoint of the original magnetic loop to another lower right footpoint (see the red arrow in Fig. 4b).
The cusp-shape structure formed at 01:26:26 UT in 94 ˚A (see Fig. 4c), the loop top of the cusp-shape structure and
the two footpoints brightened at the same time. The brightened areas are identiﬁed with red dashed box and orange
arrows in Fig. 4c, respectively. Meanwhile, the loop top of cusp-shape structure was located in the junction of two
opposite magnetic ﬁeld (see the red dashed box in Figs. 4c and d, respectively). It indicates that the region of magnetic
reconnection may be locate in the current sheet above cusp-shape structure (see Figure 1 of Forbes & Acton 1996). At
the same time (01:26:24−01:26:38 UT), YNSRS observed the type RS bursts (see the right lower panel in Fig.4c and
Fig.2b). Combining with the EUV and radio data, we realize that the scenario may be the newly emerging magnetic
loop reconnected with the original loop, forming a cusp-shape structure. Type RS bursts caused by the electron beam
accelerated by the magnetic reconnection and propagating from loop-top toward the footpoints (sunwards) in the
cusp-shape structure. The accelerated electrons ﬁnally enter in the lower atmosphere and heat the lower atmosphere,
resulting in the phenomenon of two footpoints brightening at the same time in 94 ˚A (see Fig. 4c).

Fig.

After the type RS bursts, the type U bursts (Nos.1−23) appeared, the turnover frequencies and corresponding
coronal altitudes deduced from Equation (1) of type U bursts were displayed in Fig. 3. The turnover frequency of
type U burst is the lowest frequency of each type U burst. In other words, the turnover frequency is a lower than the
starting and ending frequency of each type U burst, respectively, which means that the trajectory of the electron beam
ﬁrst moves from the high-density coronal region to the low-density region, and then to the high-density region again.
4e shows that chromospheric evaporation phenomenon may be observed in the cusp-shape structure at
01:27:09 UT in 131 ˚A. It is manifested as the brightening EUV propagating along the loop from the right foot-
point to the left one (see the yellow arrows in Fig. 4e). Meanwhile, the Nos.1−7 type U bursts occurred (see lower
right and left panels in Fig. 4e). According to the sequence of various features shown in Figs. 4a-4e, we acquire a
scenario such that the electrons were accelerated by magnetic reconnection and the cusp-shape structure formed. The
accelerating electrons propagate along the magnetic loop to the footpoints (sunwards) and produced type RS bursts,
some energetic electrons were reﬂected by the magnetic mirror eﬀect in one footpoint region and moved up along the
loop to the loop-top (unti-sunwards), and then moved down to another footpoint (sunwards) producing the type U
bursts. A part of the energetic electrons and heating conduction front reached the chromosphere (see Forbes & Acton,
1996, Figure 1), the energetic electrons injected into the chromosphere and heated the chromospheric plasma, the
chromospheric plasma propagating along the loop caused the brightening EUV moving in the loop observed in 131
˚A (see Fig. 4e) with the velocity of about 360 km s−1.

Subsequently, at 01:27:33 UT, the remote brightening of the cusp-shape structure was observed in 131 ˚A(see
Fig. 4f), and the whole cusp-shape structure rose up and brightened. The third group of type U bursts (Nos. 8−23,
01:28:17−01:28:52 UT), which is the type U bursts with the largest number and the fastest generation rate occurred at
this event. After the third group of type U bursts, a signiﬁcant brightening in the whole EUV bands until the detector
was saturated and could no longer distinguish the cusp-shape structure. At this time, the ﬂare was at the maximum
moment in soft X-ray observed by GOES.

We investigated the turnover frequencies of the type U bursts (Nos.1−23) and their corresponding coronal altitudes
(see Fig. 3). We notice that the turnover frequencies of all type U bursts occurred between 696±3 and 766±3 MHz,
and the corresponding coronal altitudes were between 20.5±0.1 and 19.0±0.1 Mm (from the solar surface). Combining
with the evolution of cusp-shape structure observed by SDO/AIA, the corresponding region of the turnover frequency
should be the loop-top of cusp-shape structure. Therefore, the decreasing turnover frequency of type U bursts means
the rising altitude of the loop-top continuously, which indicated the expansion of the whole ﬂare loop system. According
to the turnover frequencies of type U bursts in Fig. 3, we estimated the frequency drift rate is − 0.7 ± 0.1 MHz s−1
by the linear ﬁtting, and the velocity of the whole ﬂare loop system is 14.7 ± 0.2 km s−1 (unti-sunwards) estimated by
Equation (1). In addition, from the observation data of YNSRS and HiRAS, we have not found the second harmonic

Decimetric type U solar radio bursts

structure of type U bursts. Therefore, the calculation of coronal altitude is based on the fundamental frequency
radiation, that is, s = 1 in fobs = sfp.

Fig. 3 shows the lowest turnover frequency of the type U bursts is 695±3 MHz, which corresponding to the density
of the loop-top is about 6.0(±0.1) × 109 cm−3 by fp [kHz] = 8.98(cid:112)ne [cm−3]. The two bifurcations of the type U
bursts extend to about 800±3 MHz, which corresponding to the density of footpoints is about 7.9(±0.1) × 109 cm−3.
Both theories and observations assume that the ﬂare loop system is expanding continuously during the solar eruption,
which is manifested by the rising of ﬂare loop system and the separation of footpoints in the corona. At the same
time, a newly formed ﬂare loop will be at a higher height of the corona than the others (e.g. ˇSvestka et al. 1987; Lin
et al. 1995; Forbes & Acton 1996; Lin 2004; Yan et al. 2013; Gao et al. 2014b). This behavior of the ﬂare loop is
not dependent on the plasma motion, but the result of the region of magnetic reconnection moving to new magnetic
ﬁeld lines. We notice that the curve of the turnover frequency of type U bursts in Fig. 3 is very steep at U5 and
U7, it indicates that the turnover frequencies of Nos. 5 and 7, type U bursts decrease signiﬁcantly at that moments,
also means the loop-tops rising signiﬁcantly. In contrast, the turnover frequencies of the other type U bursts decrease
relatively slowly, it indicates the slow rising of the loop-tops. The possible explanations of the Nos. 5 and 7 decreasing
signiﬁcantly is that the electron beams which reﬂected by the magnetic mirror eﬀect move along the newly formed
loops at a higher height in the magnetic reconnection region. Meanwhile, the turnover frequencies of most type U
bursts decrease steadily, it may demonstrate that the whole ﬂare loop system is rising. We calculate the velocity of
the ﬂare loop system rising is 14.7± 0.2 km s−1. According to Figure 4 in Lin (2004), we sketch the formation process
of U5 and U7 (see Fig.5).

It is worth noting that DPS in decimetric band is usually interpreted as radio signals of plasmoids formed during
magnetic reconnection (e.g. Kliem et al. 2000; B´arta et al. 2008; Gao et al. 2014b; Karlicky et al. 2018). Based on
Lin & Forbes (2000) solar eruption model, Shen et al. (2011) studied the magnetic reconnection rate MA during
magnetic reconnection through the numerical simulations, and found that MA increased very slowly in the initial
stage of magnetic reconnection, but increased signiﬁcantly 5−8 times after the emergence of the ﬁrst plasmoid or
magnetic island (see Figure 5 in Shen et al. 2011). Likewise, the numerical simulations of Ni et al. (2015, 2016, 2018)
also demonstrated that the magnetic reconnection rate increased rapidly to 5 times after the emergence of plasma
instability. In our work, the DPS occurred after the No. 9 type U burst observed by YNSRS at 01:28:23 UT and
the frequency range is about 700−740 MHz see ‘DPS-H’ in Fig. 2e). The center frequency and drifting direction of
‘DPS-H’ are displayed with solid arrows in Fig. 3. According to the Equation (1), the velocity of the plasmoid is 137
± 60 km s−1 (anti-sunwards). Meanwhile, the structure of this plasmoid can also be clearly observed in SDO/AIA
94, 131, and 211 ˚A bands (see Fig. 6), especially in 94 ˚A (as shown by the arrows in Figs. 6a-6b). According to the
SDO/AIA data, we obtain the velocity of the plasmoid is about 212 km s−1 (anti-sunwards). These two speeds are
almost the same, the little diﬀerence of the plasmoid velocity calculated in EUV and radio data may be due to the
coronal density model dependent or projection eﬀect.

In this event, before the occurrence of ‘DPS-H’ in Fig. 2e, the generation rate of the type U bursts was about 1 every
10 seconds, and after the ‘DPS-H’, it increased to about 5 every 10 seconds. It manifested that after the emergence
of the ﬁrst plasmoid, the generation rate of type U bursts enhanced ﬁve times. Furthermore, Fig. 2f displayed that
some type U bursts after ‘DPS-H’ appeared intensively and caused some of them too close to resolve. Therefore, we
assume that a factor of 5 times is just a lower limit. The type U bursts are generated by electron beams moving
along the ﬂare loop, so the generation rate of type U bursts may represent the generation rate of electron beams,
and the magnetic reconnection rate could be described by the generation rate of type U bursts. We suggest that this
observed phenomenon may ﬁrstly support the results of numerical simulations by Shen et al. (2011); Ni et al. (2015,
2016, 2018), in the process of magnetic reconnection, when the plasma instability occurs, the magnetic reconnection
rate will increase signiﬁcantly.

In addition, we also note that type U bursts occurred before/after the ‘DPS-H’ observed by YNSRS (see Figs. 2e-2f),
and their turnover frequencies are not concentrated in one point. Before the ‘DPS-H’, the turnover frequency range
of type U burst (such as No.9) is between 706 and 716 MHz, as well as the frequency range is about 10 MHz (see
Figs. 2e). However, after the ‘DPS-H’, the frequency range of turnover frequency is obviously broadened. From Figs.
2f, the frequency range of turnover frequency, such as No.10 in Fig. 2f, is between 696 and 726 MHz with the frequency
range of 30 MHz. The duration of this state is 20 seconds, since then, the frequency range turns back to 10 MHz
(see No.19 in Fig. 2f).According to the sequence of features, the changes of turnover frequency range before/after the
‘DPS-H’ may manifest the variation of the density at the loop-top, we calculate the average density of the loop-top

6

Gao et al.

before the ‘DPS-H’ (or the plasmoid generation), it is about 6.3 ×109 cm−3, and the ﬂuctuation amplitude of the
density is ± 0.1×109 cm−3. On the other hand, after the plasmoid generation, the average density of the loop-top
is about 6.3 ×109 cm−3, but the ﬂuctuation amplitude of the density is ±0.3×109 cm−3. It demonstrates that the
density at the loop-top has been in a signiﬁcant ﬂuctuation before and after the ‘DPS-H’ (or the formation of the
plasmoid), which is from 6.3(±0.1) × 109 cm−3 to 6.3(±0.3) × 109 cm−3. The observation results may support the
numerical simulations of Fang et al. (2016), they simulated the deposition of energy driven by magnetic reconnection
in a ﬂare loop during the ﬂare impulsive phase, resulting in chromospheric evaporation between the two footpoints at
a speed of hundreds of kilometers per second. The simulation results show that the turbulence phenomenon appears
at the top of the ﬂare loop and may be an eﬀective non-thermal particle accelerator, and the magnetic island (or
plasmoid) can capture non-thermal particles at the loop-top and cause the density ﬂuctuation.

radio frequency interferences, ‘Storm’ and ‘DPS’ structures are also displayed. The frequency range of YNSRS data of Fig. 2a is indicated

2.2. EUV Observations

In order to better understand the physical process in this event, we review this process from EUV observations.
By analyzing the data from SDO/AIA and HMI LOS magnetograms, the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory
(STEREO, Kaiser et al. 2008), we found this event including three procedures, EUV disturbances, magnetic reconnec-
tion, and jet eruptions.

triangle symbols represent turnover frequencies and associated altitudes of type U bursts. The center frequency and altitude of ‘DPS-H’ is
indicated by a solid line.

2.2.1. The ﬁrst stage: EUV disturbances

Before the radio bursts, the cusp-shape structure was not formed in SDO/AIA, and EUV disturbances occurred
between 01:16:09 and 01:22:36 UT (see Fig. 7). Four obvious EUV disturbances were observed in 94 and 171 ˚A bands,
respectively, which manifested the rapid movement of the enhancement structures in the ﬂare loop. According to
the distribution of emission intensity in time sequence, we estimated that the velocity of the ﬁrst and the second
disturbances are 217.6 km s−1 and 113.3 km s−1, respectively. After 01:20:45 UT, the studied ﬂare loop slightly rises
up, which result in the unsuitable the speed of the third and the fourth disturbances.

Figs. 7a-7b show the ﬁrst EUV disturbance observed in 94 and 171 ˚A, respectively. Fig. 7c shows the second EUV
disturbance observed in 94 ˚A, and Figs. 7e-7f display the third and fourth EUV disturbance, respectively. We also
note that all the EUV disturbances in this event come from the left upper footpoint of the original magnetic loop (the
area framed with red dashed box in Fig. 7c), the corresponding region is also drawn in the HMI magnetogram of
Fig. 7d. It manifests that the left upper footpoint of the original magnetic loop is located at polarity inversion line.
Therefore, the EUV disturbances propagating in the magnetic loop may come from the magnetic reconnection near
the left upper footpoint of loops. Furthermore, in this event, we have not observed the reﬂection phenomenon of EUV
disturbance in the ﬂare loops, which have been reported by Kumar & Cho (2013) and Kumar et al. (2015).

2.2.2. The second stage: magnetic reconnection

The second process occurred between 01:25 and 01:28 UT (see Fig. 4). A variety of radio bursts such as RS type
III bursts, DPS and the groups of type U bursts were observed by YNRSR and HiRAS. Around the peak of the ﬂare
(∼01:28 UT), the third group of type U bursts has the largest number and the fastest generation rate, as well as the
time derivative curve of GOES 1-8 ˚A soft X-ray ﬂux also shows dramatic variability during this period (see the yellow
curve of Fig. 2a).

2.2.3. The third stage: jet eruptions
Figs. 8a-8c display the evolutionary features of three jets observed by SDO/AIA 304 ˚A between 01:32:22 and 01:48:22
UT. The ﬁrst and second jets are straight jets (see Figs. 8a and 8b), as well as the second jet has the obvious falling
down (see the white arrow of Fig. 8c). The third jet propagates along the magnetic loop rising and falling, together
In addition, because of the STEREO-A satellite
with two plasmoids are found in the third jet (see the Fig. 8c).

the same movement tendency as the SDO/AIA observed. Furthermore, we also investigate the velocity of each jet in
Fig. 9, Figs. 9a and 9b show the third jet including two parts, one part has the straight direction with the velocity of
403 km s−1 (anti-sunwards), and the other part propagates along the magnetic loop with the rising and falling speed
of 106 km s−1. The dashed lines ‘CD’ and ‘CE’ in Fig. 9c are corresponding to the second and ﬁrst jet motion trail,
respectively. The velocity of the second jet is about 260 km s−1 and the falling part is in white dashed box in Fig. 9d.

the dashed curve indicates a new loop formed after magnetic reconnection. At this time, due to the magnetic mirror eﬀect, the upward
moving electron beam just moves along the newly formed loop, resulting in the No. 5 type U burst. (b) another new loop is formed at
the magnetic reconnection point. Similar to the formation mechanism of No.5 type U burst, the new loops are constantly produced in the
magnetic reconnection point, and the electron beam moves along the newly formed loops to form No.7 type U burst.

3. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

A GOES M1.9 class ﬂare in soft X-rays occurred on February 9, 2011 including three stages: EUV disturbances,
magnetic reconnection, and jet eruptions. In the ﬁrst stage, EUV disturbances propagate from the left upper corner
footpoint of the original magnetic loop to the right lower corner footpoint (see Fig. 7). In the second stage, after the
EUV disturbances, a newly emerging magnetic loop emerges around right lower corner footpoint (see Fig. 4a) and may
be reconnect with the original magnetic loop to form cusp-shape structure (see Fig. 4c). Magnetic reconnection occurs
in current sheet above the cusp-shape structure, and chromosphere evaporation may be found to occur between the
two footpoints (see Fig. 4e). In the third stage, the magnetic reconnection releases energy and drives the jet eruptions.

Figure 10. Schematic illustration of the radio bursts and jet eruptions. (a) the newly emerging loop reconnects with the
original loop above. (b) the electrons are accelerated by magnetic reconnection to high speed and propagating along the loops,
as well as pouring into the footpoints (the RS type III solar radio bursts produced), partial energetic electrons propagating
along the loop (red curves in b) by magnetic mirror eﬀect, and the type U bursts are produced. (c) electrons propagate along
the freshly loops to produced the Nos. 5 and 7 type U bursts (red dashed curves in c). Magnetic reconnection also can lead to
the formation of jets (yellow arrows in b and c)

The scenario of this event is demonstrated in Fig. 10, in the magnetic reconnection, the high-resolution observation
data of YNSRS show several type U bursts, which are hard to be resolved in HiRAS data at the same time. After
No.9 type U burst, a DPS is recognized with a frequency drift rate of −6.2 ± 2.7 MHz s−1 (see ‘DPS-H’ in Fig. 2e).
According to the Equation (1), we calculate the velocity of the plasmoid represented by the DPS is is 137 ± 60 km s−1
(anti-sunwards), and the plasmoid is also observed by SDO/AA near the loop-top of cusp-shape structure with the
velocity of 212 km s−1 (anti-sunwards). The diﬀerence of the plasmoid velocities measured in diﬀerent wavelengths
may be due to the projection eﬀect and the uncertainty in the coronal density model. In addition, we measure the
generation rates of type U bursts before and after the ‘DPS-H’ as 1 per 10 seconds and 5 per 10 seconds, respectively.
The observations are generally consistent with the results of numerical simulations, helping us to better understand
the characteristics of the magnetic reconnection.

We also note that the frequency range of turnover frequency of type U bursts before and after the ‘DPS-H’. Before the
‘DPS-H’ (before the plasmoid formation), turnover frequency of type U burst covers a frequency range of 10 MHz. In
contrary, after the ‘DPS-H’ (after the plasmoid formation), the frequency range of turnover frequency is about 30 MHz,
as well as the latter is three times than the former one. This observations also support the numerical simulations of
the energy deposition driven by magnetic reconnection during the ﬂare impulsive phase, which produces chromospheric
evaporation between the two footpoints, and the turbulence occurs at the top of the ﬂare loop, and the plasmoids can
capture the non-thermal particles and cause the density ﬂuctuation of the loop-top.

By analyzing all the type U bursts in this event, we found that the turnover frequency of the whole type U bursts
decreased slowly, except the turnover frequency of Nos. 5 and 7, decreased suddenly. This process can be explained
by the physical process of the whole ﬂare system is expanding, and the newly loop formed by magnetic reconnection is
existing at the higher attitude than the previous loops. The energetic electron beam moving along the newly formed
loop makes the turnover frequency of Nos. 5 and 7 decreased signiﬁcantly. We calculated the rising velocity of the
whole ﬂare loop system is 14.7± 0.2 km s−1 (unti-sunwards) estimated by Equation (1). We also studied the jets
eruptions, after the magnetic reconnection, the velocity of jet eruptions is about 200−400 km s−1.
