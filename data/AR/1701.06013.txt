Abstract 

Analyses  for  81Kr  and  noble  gases  on  groundwater  from  the  deepest  aquifer  system  of  the  Baltic 

Artesian  Basin  (BAB)  were  performed  to  determine  groundwater  ages  and  uncover  the  flow 

dynamics of the system on a timescale of several hundred thousand years. We find that the system is 

controlled  by  mixing  of  three  distinct  water  masses:  Interglacial  or  recent  meteoric  water  (δ18O  ≈ 

−10.4‰) with a poorly evolved chemical and noble gas signature, glacial meltwater (δ18O ≤ −18 ‰) 

with  elevated  noble  gas  concentrations,  and  an  old,  high-salinity  brine  component  (δ18O  ≥ 

−4.5‰, ≥ 90 g Cl−/L)  with  strongly  depleted  atmospheric  noble  gas  concentrations.  The  81Kr 

measurements  are  interpreted  within  this  mixing  framework  to  estimate  the  age  of  the  end-

members.  Deconvoluted  81Kr  ages  range  from  300 ka  to  1.3 Ma  for  interglacial  or  recent  meteoric 

water and glacial meltwater. For the brine component, ages exceed the dating range of the ATTA-3 

instrument of 1.3 Ma. The radiogenic noble gas components  4He* and  40Ar* are less conclusive but 

also support an age of > 1 Ma for the brine. Based on the chemical and noble gas concentrations and 

the  dating  results,  we  conclude  that  the  brine  originates  from  evaporated  seawater  that  has  been 

modified by later water-rock interaction. As the obtained tracer ages cover several glacial cycles, we 

discuss the impact of the glacial cycles on flow patterns in the studied aquifer system.

1.  Introduction 

The evolution of brines and their mixing with – and replacement by – fresh water following changes 

in  hydrogeological  conditions  have  been  intensely  studied.  For  many  sedimentary  basins  at  high 

latitudes in North America and the crystalline Canadian Shield, the buildup and demise of Pleistocene 

ice sheets resulted in a considerable reorganization of groundwater flow systems (e.g. Person et al., 

2007; Stotler et al., 2012). Shallow aquifers were flushed completely with glacial meltwater (Clark et 

al., 2000; McIntosh et al., 2012) and, in many places, relict meltwater is still found today (e.g. Person 

et  al.,  2007;  McIntosh  et  al.,  2012).  In  Europe,  several  hydraulic  modeling  and  hydrogeochemical 

studies  examined  the  effect  of  the  Scandinavian  ice  sheet  on  groundwater  dynamics  (Voss  and 

Andersson, 1993; Smellie et al., 1995; Boulton et al., 1995; 1996; Piotrowski, 1997; Laaksoharju et al., 

1999;  2008;  Zuzevicius,  2010;  Saks  et  al.,  2012).  In  the  sedimentary  Baltic  Artesian  Basin  (BAB), 

located  south  of  the  Fennoscandian  shield,  glacial  meltwater  was  identified  (e.g.  Vaikmäe  et  al., 

2001; Raidla et al., 2009) and glacial flushing was studied by Zuzevicius et al. (2010) and Saks et al. 

(2012).  Knowing  how  the  Pleistocene  glaciations  influenced  the  flow  dynamics  in  the  BAB  has 

important implications for sustainable management of the groundwater as a source of drinking water 

(Vaikmäe et al., 2001) and for potential long-term storage of radioactive waste or CO2 (Shogenova et 

al., 2011). 

In the deeper parts of the BAB, a high-salinity brine is present (Mokrik, 1997), the evolution of which 

has  never  been  studied  in  detail.  Many  such  types  of  brines  originated  from  seawater,  which  was 

later  modified  by  water-rock  interaction.  Proposed  processes  for  the  mineralization  of  such  brines 

include  evaporation  (evaporative  brines)  and  freezing  (cryogenic  brines)  of  seawater  (e.g.  Herut  et 

al., 1990; Bottomley et al., 1999; Starinsky and Katz, 2003), besides the dissolution of evaporite rocks, 

or a combination of these (e.g. Knauth, 1988; Fontes and Matray, 1993; Fritz, 1997; Vengosh et al., 

2000;  Pinti  et  al.,  2011;  Millot  et  al.,  2011;  Bagheri  et  al.,  2014).  These  processes  are  often 

distinguished  based  on  the  chemical  composition  of  the  brine,  which  is  complicated  by  the 

dissolution and precipitation of rock forming minerals that further modify the chemical composition 

of  the  brine  on  different  time  scales  (e.g.  relatively  fast  reacting  carbonate  and  sulphate  mineral 

phases  versus  slowly  reacting  Al-silicate  mineral  phases).  Recently,  Greene  et  al.  (2008)  proposed 

using heavy noble gas concentrations as an alternative tool to differentiate between evaporation and 

freezing.  The  two  processes  result  in  very  distinct  changes  in  noble  gas  concentrations  as  salinity 

increases  during  brine  formation.  Far  fewer  processes  can  potentially  change  the  noble  gas 

concentrations after the brine formation compared to the range of processes that might change the 

chemical composition of the brine.

In this study, we focus on the Cambrian Aquifer System (CAS) of the BAB. This aquifer system is found 

across the entire basin and has been studied extensively in Northern Estonia, where it occurs close to 

the surface (Vaikmäe et al., 2001; Raidla et al., 2009; 2012; 2014). Raidla et al. (2009) proposed that 

groundwater in the northeastern part of the CAS represents a mixture of three distinct water types: 

a) recent meteoric fresh water, b) fresh glacial meltwater with an isotopic composition depleted in 

18O  and  2H  (δ18O  as  low  as  −23‰),  and  c)  a  brine  component  enriched  in  18O  and  2H.  Raidla  et  al. 

(2012) used 14C to date the meltwater intrusion in Northern Estonia to 14–27 ka before present (BP), 

which is also the time of the advance and maximum extent of the Weichselian glaciation in the area 

(Kalm,  2012).  Similarly,  water  in  the  overlying  Middle-Upper  Devonian  aquifer  system  in  Lithuania 

was also  14C-dated to a few thousand years to 27 ka ago (Mokrik et al., 2009). So far, the evolution 

and residence time of the deepest formation waters in the BAB with high brine fractions have only 

been  qualitatively  assessed  by  Mokrik  (1997)  based  on  the  paleohydrogeological  evolution  of  the 

area, the degree of the mineralization and relative ratios of major ions of the different groundwaters 

(e.g.  (Na++Cl-)/HCO3

-).  The  chemical  composition  of  the  deep  formation  waters  (Mokrik,  1997)  is 

considerably  more  evolved  compared  to  that  of  groundwater  from  the  Middle-Upper  Devonian 

aquifer  system  (Mokrik  et  al.,  2009),  indicating  residence  times  on  the  order  of  hundreds  of 

thousands to millions of years. 

Radioisotope dating of the groundwater in deeper (older) parts of the basin could further constrain 

the  evolution  of  the  brine  and  improve  the  understanding  of  present  and  past  flow  dynamics,  but 

expected residence times are outside the dating range of  14C. Although  36Cl would be applicable to 

the expected range of residence times, it would be difficult to interpret due to the unknown origin of 

the  high  salinity  in  the  deeper  part  of  the  basin  (Phillips,  2000).  Similarly,  4He,  40Ar,  and  other 

radiogenic  noble  gas  isotopes  can  be  used  for  absolute  dating  only  after  calibration  of  their 

accumulation  rates  by  independent  age  information  (Torgersen  and  Stute,  2013).  Under  these 

conditions,  81Kr  is  a  near  ideal  tracer  thanks  to  its  chemical  inertness,  constant  atmospheric 

concentration,  and  the  likely  absence  of  any  significant  subsurface  sources  or  sinks  other  than 

radioactive  decay  (Collon  et  al.,  2004,  Jiang  et  al.,  2012).  Recent  advances  in  the  measurement 

technique  resulting  in  higher  counting  efficiency  and  thus  smaller  sample  size  and  shorter 

measurement time (Jiang et al., 2012) have enabled a more widespread application of this tracer in 

dating old groundwater (e.g. Sturchio et al., 2014; Aggarwal et al., 2015). 

Here, we present chemical, isotope, and noble gas data of groundwater collected from the Cambrian 

aquifer  system  (CAS)  of  the  BAB,  with  a  special  emphasis  on  81Kr.  Because  ice  sheets  reorganized 

groundwater flow on a regional scale, the CAS should also be studied at a regional scale. Most of the 

past studies were conducted on more local scales, except for two modeling studies (Saks et al., 2012; 

4 

 
Virbulis et al., 2013), the latter of which estimated the hydraulic age of groundwater in the CAS to be 

on the order of several hundreds of ka to 1 Ma. In the light of such long residence times, it is crucial 

to  consider  the  effect  of  repeated  glacial  cycles  on  the  long-term  evolution  of  groundwater 

composition and flow. Sampling the deeper parts of the CAS on a regional scale for chemistry, noble 

gases, and multiple dating tracers (81Kr, 85Kr, 39Ar, 14C, 4He, 40Ar) allows us to elucidate the evolution 

of the  brine,  mixing  proportions  of  the  different  groundwater components,  and  the  flow  dynamics 

over the last 1 Ma.  

2.  Study Area 

The Baltic Artesian Basin (BAB), one of the largest artesian basins in Europe, covers the territory of 

Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, parts of Poland, Russia, and Belarus as well as a large area of the Baltic 

Sea (Fig. 1a). Geologically, the BAB is situated in the northwestern part of the East European platform 

on the southern slope of the Fennoscandian Shield. The Proterozoic crystalline basement is covered 

by some Proterozoic (Ediacaran) and mainly Paleozoic (Cambrian to Cretaceous) sedimentary rocks. 

To  the  north,  northwest,  and  southeast,  the  basin  is  delimited  by  the  outcropping  crystalline 

basement (Mokrik, 1997; Raukas and Teedumäe, 1997). From there, the basement and the overlying 

sediments gradually dip towards the central part of the BAB by 2–4 m/km (Fig. 1c). In the east and 

the  southwest,  the  BAB  borders  the  Moscow  basin  and  the  Danish-Polish  basin,  respectively.  The 

southwest dipping sediments reach a maximum thickness of ~600 m in the east and of ~5000 m at 

the border to the Danish-Polish Basin (Fig. 1b; Mokrik, 1997).  

Hydrogeologically,  the  BAB  is  a  complex  multi-layered  system  of  aquifers  and  aquitards  (Mokrik, 

1997).  The  Cambrian  aquifer  system  (CAS),  which  is  the  focus  of  this  study,  directly  overlies  the 

crystalline  basement  in  most  of  the  BAB  (Fig.  1)  and  consists  mainly  of  dolomitic  sandstones  and 

siltstones  (Raidla  et  al.,  2006).  In  the  northeastern  part,  the  system  is  also  known  as  Cambrian-

Vendian (Ediacaran) aquifer system (Cm–V) due to the occurrence of Ediacaran sandstones and clays. 

There, the CAS constitutes an important drinking water resource. The thickness of the CAS averages 

at  about  80–100 m,  but  varies  from  about  50 m  in  the  central  part  to  200  m  at  the  northern  and 

southern fringes to several 100 m near the Danish-Polish Basin (Poprawa et al., 1999; Luksevics et al., 

2012). The CAS is covered by less permeable dolomitic limestones and claystones of the Ordovician-

Silurian (O–S) formation (Fig. 1b, c) that reach a thickness of more than 1 km in the deeper parts of 

the BAB and pinch out in the southeastern and northern parts (Poprawa et al., 1999; Luksevics et al., 

2012).  

Both formations, the CAS and the O–S, have been faulted considerably during the Late Silurian and 

Early Devonian, especially along the Liepāja-Pskov fault zone in the central part of the BAB (cf. Fig. 1; 
5 

 
Raukas and Teedumäe, 1997; Brangulis and Kanevs, 2002). Later major tectonic activity was mostly 

limited to the glacioisostatic downwarping and uplift caused by the late Cenozoic glaciations (Mokrik, 

1997; Raukas and Teedumäe, 1997). Faults are an important factor for aquifer connectivity, as they 

might  either  limit  the  groundwater  flow  or  act  as  vertical  conduits  and  connect  otherwise 

disconnected  aquifers  (Virbulis  et  al.,  2013).  In  addition,  they  may  also  have  acted  as  potential 

pathway for the infiltration of the brine from the surface. 

The  present-day  hydraulic  heads  indicate  recharge  of  the  CAS  in  the  southeast  along  the  Belarus-

Masurian Anticline, a general northward flow direction, and discharge of groundwater to the Baltic 

Sea. Virbulis et al. (2013) estimated a hydraulic conductivity K of 2.95 m/day for the CAS. In contrast, 

for  the  thick  overlying  O–S  rock  formation,  they  obtained  a  hydraulic  conductivity  on  the  order  of 

10−9 m/day,  making  it  an  effective  aquitard.  This  situation  results  in  a  predominately  horizontal 

groundwater  flow  in  the  CAS  (Virbulis  et  al.,  2013).  Several  authors  have  suggested  that  regional 

groundwater  flow  in  the  BAB,  including  the  CAS,  reversed  during  the  various  glacial  cycles  of  the 

Quaternary (Jõeleht, 1998; Vaikmäe et al., 2001; Vaikmäe et al., 2008; Zuzevicius, 2010; Saks et al., 

2012), when the Scandinavian ice sheet covered much of the BAB (cf. Fig. 1a; Guobyte and Satkunas, 

2011; Kalm, 2012). 

3.  Methods 

3.1.  Sampling and Analytical Methods 

Groundwater  samples  were  collected  from  seven  deep  wells  (cf.  Table  1,  Fig. 1)  during  three  field 

campaigns: (I) from May to September 2012 for 14C analyses, (II) in October 2012 for 81Kr, 39Ar, δ18O, 

δ2H, and chemical analyses, and (III) from June to October 2013 for noble gas analyses. To monitor air 

contamination during gas extraction for 81Kr and 39Ar dating and/or inter-aquifer leakage in the well, 

85Kr  analyses  were  conducted.  More  details  on  the  fieldwork  and  the  correction  for  (air) 

contamination are given in the Electronic Appendix A. 

Radiocarbon samples were extracted by direct precipitation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from 

200–300 L of water (Aggarwal et al., 2014). Radiocarbon activities in groundwater were measured by 

ultra-low-level liquid scintillation (Quantulus 1220) at Tallinn University of Technology. The 14C results 

are reported as percentage of modern carbon (pmC) with a measurement error of the radiocarbon 

activity of ±0.5 pmC. 

For  81Kr  and  39Ar  dating,  a  sample  size  of  2000–3000 L  of  water  is  required.  These  large-volume 

samples were pumped through a vacuum extraction chamber and the extracted gas transferred to a 

6 

 
steel container (Purtschert et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2014). Extraction of Kr and Ar from the bulk gas was 

performed  at  the  Physics  Institute,  University  of  Bern,  by  preparative  gas  chromatography 

(Purtschert et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2014). 

The  isotope  ratios  81Kr/Kr  and  85Kr/Kr  were  determined  using  the  ATTA-3  instrument  in  the 

Laboratory for Radiokrypton Dating, Argonne National Laboratory (Jiang et al., 2012). The Atom Trap 

Trace  Analysis  method  (ATTA)  is  a  selective  and  efficient  atom  counter  capable  of  measuring  both 

81Kr/Kr and 85Kr/Kr ratios of environmental samples in the range of 10−14–10−10 (Chen et al., 1999). For 

81Kr dating in the age range of 50 ka–1.3 Ma, the required sample size is 5–10 μL (STP) of krypton gas, 

which  can  be  extracted  from  approximately  100–200  L  of  water.  Abundances  of  81Kr  are  reported 

relative  to  modern  atmospheric  air  as  Rsample  =  (81Kr/Kr)sample/(81Kr/Kr)air.  For  85Kr,  the  results  are 
reported  in  the  conventional  units  of  dpm/ccKr,  which  stands  for  the  number  of  85Kr  decays  per 
minute  per  mL (STP)  of  Kr  gas  (for  conversion,  100  dpm/ccKr  corresponds  to  a  85Kr/Kr  ratio  of 
3.03 × 10−11). 

Activities  of  39Ar  were  measured  by  low-level  gas  proportional  counting  at  the  Physics  Institute, 

University  of  Bern  (Loosli,  1983;  Loosli  et  al.,  1986;  Forster  et  al.,  1992).  Results  are  expressed  in 

%modern Ar, relative to the atmospheric activity concentration of 1.78 mBq/LAr (Loosli et al., 2000). 

Stable  isotope  ratios,  expressed  in  standard  delta  notation  (δ18O  and  δ2H),  were  measured  at  the 

Physics  Institute,  University  of  Bern,  with  a  Picarro  cavity  ring-down  laser  analyzer.  Duplicate 

measurements  are  generally  in  good  agreement  (±0.5‰  for  δ18O  and  ±1‰  for  δ2H),  close  to  the 

analytical uncertainty of 0.1‰ and <1‰ for δ18O and δ2H, respectively. 

The  samples  for chemical  analysis  were  stored  at  room temperature  (21°C)  in  brown  200 mL  glass 

flasks with a rubber sealing until analysis at the Institute of Geological Sciences, University of Bern, in 

January  2015.  The  samples  were  filtered  with  0.45  µm  PES-filters.  For  the  various  analyses,  the 

groundwater samples were gravimetrically diluted in up to four different dilutions (1:100 to 1:2000) 

due  to  the  elevated  salinity.  Total  inorganic  carbon  (TIC)  and  total  organic  carbon  (TOC)  were 

analyzed using a TIC/TOC Analyzer (Analytic Jena multi N/C 2100S). Major anions and cations were 

analyzed  by  ion-chromatography  (Metrohm  ProfIC  AnCat  MCS)  and  trace  elements  by  ICP-OES 

(Varian 710ES). Chemical data from Northern Estonia were measured by ion-chromatography at the 

University of Vilnius. The analytical error of all the chemical analyses is ±5% with the total uncertainty 

being  better  than  ±10%.  Mineral  saturation  states  were  modeled  with  the  geochemical  code 

PHREEQC  (Parkhurst  and Appelo, 1999; v.  2.18)  using  the  Wateq4f  and  Pitzer  activity  formulations 

and databases for samples with salinities below and above that of seawater, respectively. 

For  noble  gas  analysis,  water  samples  were  transferred  to  copper  tubes  in-line  with  the  well,  and 

subsequently  the  tubes  were  immediately  pinched  off  (Beyerle  et  al.,  2000;  Aeschbach-Hertig  and 
7 

 
Solomon,  2012).  The  samples  were  analyzed  with  a  GV  Instruments  MM5400  noble  gas  mass 

spectrometer  at  the  Institute  of  Environmental  Physics,  Heidelberg  (Freundt  et  al.,  2013). 

Measurement  precision  is  better  than  1%  for  light  noble  gas  concentrations,  1–2 %  for  the  heavy 

noble gases, and better than 0.5 % for the Ne isotope ratio. 

3.2.  Evaluation of the Noble Gas Data 

Often,  groundwater  is  found  to  be  oversaturated  relative  to  air-equilibrated  water  (AEW)  and  the 

additional  amount  of  dissolved  gases  is  termed  excess  air  (EA,  Heaton  and  Vogel,  1981)  and 

expressed as relative Ne excess ΔNe:

Δ𝑁𝑁 = �

(1) 

For  a  mixture  of  different  water  components,  as  in  the  BAB,  two  definitions  of 

 are 

possible:  a) 

   –  the  concentration  in  air-equilibrated  water  at  the  salinity  and  temperature

where fi are the mixing proportions of the water components. This second definition, which requires

(𝑇𝑒, 𝑆𝑒)

𝑒

some knowledge about the composition of the mixing components, reflects the amount of excess air 

added during infiltration. 

Groundwaters oversaturated in gases at ambient conditions are prone to degassing, which may be a 

diffusion-controlled  and/or  solubility-controlled  process,  resulting 

in  characteristic  noble  gas 

fractionation  patterns  (e.g.  Aeschbach-Hertig  et  al.,  2008;  Aeschbach-Hertig  and  Solomon,  2012). 

While the groundwaters sampled in this study were all undersaturated in-situ, this may have changed 

into  oversaturation  during  the  ascent  of  the  water  in  the  wells  due  to  the  decreasing  hydraulic 

pressure. The simplest form of fractionation is the Rayleigh fractionation model (Stute and Schlosser, 

2000; Ballentine et al., 2002):

and  Liss,  1984).  Early  excess-air  degassing  models  used  n=1  (e.g.  Stute  and  Schlosser,  2000), 

however, recently it has been pointed out that n could be smaller (e.g. Aeschbach-Hertig et al., 2008; 

Aeschbach-Hertig  and  Solomon, 2012).  For diffusion-controlled degassing, f can be calculated from 

the 20Ne/22Ne isotope fractionation by rearranging Equation 3:

3.3.  Deriving Groundwater Ages 

For easier reading, we employ the following definitions of 81Kr ages: 

81Kr age (81t):   Apparent  groundwater  residence  time  of  a  water  sample  that  neglects  dispersive 

mixing (also known as piston-flow age) and that is simply calculated by (Sturchio et

The individual end members – in this study interglacial or recent meteoric water (henceforth called

activities, it is therefore necessary to separate the measured noble gas concentrations to obtain the 

contribution from each end member. Thereby, two effects have to be considered: a) the nonlinearity 

of decay ages and b) the different Kr concentrations of the mixing endmembers.

4.  Results 

4.1.  Chemical Composition 

Groundwaters show a considerable range in chemical composition (Table 2). Groundwater pH values 

measured in the field range between 7.0 and 8.1 (Table 2) and become 5.75 and 7.20 when adjusted 

for  calcite  saturation  (see section  5.1.3).  At the well head,  mildly  reducing  redox  potentials  prevail 

(EhAg/AgCl –72 to –12 mV) in agreement with observed concentrations of CH4 (Table 3) and the absence 
− (<1.6 mg/L; Table 2). Total dissolved solids (TDS) range from brackish water (5.1 

of measurable NO3

g/kg)  to  brines  that  are  enriched  in  salt  by  3–5  times  relative  to  seawater  (up  to  144 g/kg). 

Groundwaters  are  of  the  general  Na-Cl  type,  with  elevated  amounts  of  Ca2+  or  Mg2+  in  the  more 

saline groundwaters. Ionic concentrations display linear relationships between Cl– and Na+, K+, Li+, Br–

10 

 
 
 
 
–2 (except well 6) from the brackish to the saline groundwaters. Molar ratios of Na+/Cl– and 

, and SO4
Br–/Cl–  are  close  to  those  of  seawater.  The absolute  concentrations of  Cl–,  Na+,  and  Br– extend  the 

range  of  previously  collected  groundwater  from  the  CAS  along  the  line  defined  by  evaporation  of 

seawater and dilution of seawater with pure water (Fig. 2). 

4.2.  Stable Isotopes of Water (δ18O and δ2H) 

Stable  isotopes  of  the  water  molecule  range  from −13.6‰  to  −4.4‰  for  δ18O and  from  −101‰  to 

−35‰ for δ2H (Fig. 3, Table 2) and vary in their D-excess (D=δ2H−8*δ18O), indicating a varying origin 

of the dominant water component in the groundwater samples. Groundwater from wells 1 and 2 are 

isotopically depleted in  18O and  2H compared to the present-day annual-mean isotopic composition 

of −10.6 ‰ for δ18O in Riga (IAEA/WMO, 2016). In contrast, the saline samples are enriched in  18O 

and 2H compared to the present-day annual mean. These shifts in isotopic composition are explained 

by mixing of meteoric fresh water with isotopically depleted (but meteoric) glacial meltwater and an 

isotopically  enriched  brine  component,  as  proposed  by  Raidla  et  al.  (2009).  The  shift  in  isotopic 

composition away from the MWL for the more saline samples suggests a non-meteoric source of the 

brine component or evaporation and/or high temperature water-rock interaction (Horita, 2005). 

4.3.  Dissolved Gases 

Noble  gas  data  from  campaign III  are  shown  in  Table  3,  including,  for  comparison,  air-equilibrated 

concentrations  for the  possible  water  components. The atmospheric noble gas concentrations vary 

quite  widely,  ranging  from  significantly  above  to  far  below  air-equilibrated  fresh  water  with 

increasing salinity. Groundwater samples from wells 1, 2, 5, and 7* are considerably oversaturated in 

Ne  with  respect  to  both  definitions  of 

,  especially  for  wells  1  and  2  with  the  highest  glacial 

meltwater proportion (Table 3). Shallower and less mineralized groundwater samples from the CAS 

𝑁𝑒
𝐶𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒

in Northern Estonia exhibit even higher amounts of excess air (Weißbach, 2014), which is attributed 

to the recharge of glacial meltwater either through basal melting (Vaikmäe et al., 2001) or infiltration 

of  surface  meltwaters  (Grundl  et  al.,  2013).  In  contrast,  negative  ΔNes  for  wells  3  and  4  indicate 

degassing. A similar pattern is also observed for the heavier noble gases. 

All samples contain several orders of magnitude more  4He than does AEW (Table 3).  3He/4He ratios 

are depleted compared to the atmosphere (3Heatm/4Heatm = 1.38·10−6) and are typical for the crustal 
production ratio, which is on the order of 2·10−8 (Mamyrin and Tolstikhin, 1984; Torgersen and Stute, 

2013). The 40Ar/36Ar ratios (Table 3) are considerably higher (up to 419) than the atmospheric ratio of 

 = 298.6  (Lee  et  al.,  2006).  Both  He  and  Ar  thus  indicate  the  presence  of  a  non-atmospheric 

𝐴𝑎
component.

The  concentrations  of  major  gases  inferred  from  the  gas  extracted  in  the  field  for  81Kr  analysis 

(campaign II) complement the noble gas data from campaign III (Table 3). The Ar concentrations from 

the two sampling campaigns are generally consistent with each other for an extraction yield of 80–

90% of the field degassing (see Fig. A2 in the Electronic Appendix C). Total dissolved gas contents of 

the  groundwater  range  from  19–107 cm3 (STP)/kg  for  an  extraction  yield  of  85%  (Table  3).  The 

composition of the extracted gas is dominated by N2 (>97%), with the exception of well 6, where CH4 

constitutes  60%  of  the  gas.  N2  concentrations  in  the  groundwater  correspond  to  a  dissolved  gas 

pressure  of  about  2.5–11  bar  in  the  samples,  based  on  N2  solubility  extrapolated  from  seawater 

(Battino et al., 1984).  

Oversaturation of N2 relative to AEW is considerably higher than noble gas oversaturation, suggesting 

subsurface N2 sources. Measured redox potentials lie within those required for denitrification and N2 
− 
+. The similarly absent NO3

reduction, the latter in agreement with the absence of measurable NH4

suggests  that  denitrification  might  have  produced  some  N2.  However,  without  any  support  from 

isotope  and  bacteriological  data,  it  is  not  possible  to  judge  to  what  degree  denitrification  might 

explain  the  excess  in  N2.  Similarly  unknown  is  the  original  source  of  CH4  except  that  the  isotopic 

composition  indicates  a  biogenic  origin  (see Raidla et  al.,  2012  for  discussion). Based on  measured 

redox potentials and isotope compositions of dissolved CH4, TIC, SO4

2– (Raidla et al., 2012, 2014), it 

appears that, currently, CH4 in the deep CAS groundwaters is being consumed by sulphate reduction 

rather than being produced by methanogenesis. 

4.4.  Radioisotopes 

The  results  of  85Kr,  39Ar,  14C,  and  81Kr  analyses  are  given  in  Table  4.  The  85Kr  concentrations  for 

samples 2, 4, and 6 are likely the result of contamination either during gas extraction or in the well 

through  a  leaky  casing.  The  estimated  contamination  is  2–13%  and  39Ar  and  81Kr  activities  were 

corrected  accordingly  (Table  4,  see  Electronic  Appendix A  for  details  of  the  contamination 

correction). After this correction, only well 1 and, possibly, well 4 exhibit remaining 39Ar activity. For 

14C of DIC, no correction was applied, because 14C was sampled during a separate sampling campaign 

and because the degree of contamination could be different for gases and dissolved constituents. 

Contamination-corrected  isotopic  abundances  of  81Kr  relative  to  modern  atmospheric  air  (R/Rair) 
range  from 0.00±0.02  to  0.38±0.03.  This  constrains  the  upper  level  of  subsurface-produced  81Kr  to 

0.02  R/Rair  in  the  CAS,  confirming  a  previous  estimate  by  Lehmann  et  al.  (1993)  that  underground 
production  is  negligible  for  81Kr  in  most  settings.  Consequentially,  underground  production  is 

neglected  in  the  81Kr  age  calculations  in  this  article.  Abundances  of  85Kr,  39Ar,  14C,  and  81Kr  below 

detection  limits  indicate  the  absence  of  water  younger  than  50 a,  1000 a,  35 ka,  and  1.3 Ma, 

12 

 
respectively. The presence of measurable  39Ar (well 1 and 4) or  14C (well 4) activities in significantly 

81Kr depleted waters is likely due to mixing of water components of different age. For example, Well 

1 could be explained by a binary mixture of tracer-free very old water with a water component that is 

a few hundred years old (85Kr- but not 39Ar-free). The low 14C value in well 1 probably is the result of 

addition of  14C-dead  carbon,  likely  from the carbonate cement present in the aquifer (Raidla  et  al., 

2006; 2012). The reason for the relatively high 14C activity of well 4, compared to the low 81Kr value, 

is unclear, but could be related to contamination, since 14C was not contamination corrected (39Ar is 

within 2 σ< DL). In the CAS, underground production of  39Ar is negligible because  39Ar activities are 

below the detection limit for several wells. 

Based on the flow regime indicated by the present-day hydraulic head distribution (Recharge in the 

southeast, flow to the northwest and finally discharge in the north, Fig. 4, Virbulis et al., 2013), we 

expect relatively high 81Kr abundances in the southeast and decreasing values towards the Baltic Sea. 

Fig.  4  shows  that  the  well  with  the  highest  81Kr  abundance  is  indeed  located  closest  to  today’s 

recharge area in the South (sample 5). However, the 81Kr abundances of the northernmost samples (1 

and 2) are relatively high as well, in contradiction with the expected spatial pattern. 

5.  Discussion 

5.1.  Genesis of the Brine 

5.1.1.  Origin of the Brine  

The origin, time of formation, and chemical evolution of brines in sedimentary basins and crystalline 

rock environments are still under debate (e.g. McNutt et al., 1987; Knauth, 1988; Herut et al., 1990; 

Frape et al., 2003; Starinsky and Katz, 2003; Leybourne and Goodfellow, 2007; Greene et al., 2008; 

Stotler  et  al.,  2012;  Bagheri  et  al.,  2014).  With  respect  to  the  origin  and  the  time  of  formation  of 

deep-seated  brines,  different  scenarios  have  been  invoked.  These  include  dissolution  of  evaporite 

rocks,  evaporation  of  seawater  (with  or  without  later  modification  by  water-rock  interaction),  and 

enrichment  of  seawater  by  cryogenic  or  ion-filtration  processes.  All  these  processes  carry  certain 

qualitative  information  about  the  brine  formation  time  and  need  to  be  consistent  with  the  paleo-

hydrogeological evolution of the basin. Evaporite dissolution may take place whenever groundwater 

is  exposed  to  evaporitic  sediments.  Evaporative  enrichment  of  seawater  requires  the  presence  of 

seawater  and  appropriate  climatic  and  surface  hydraulic  conditions  such  that  evaporation  in  the 

basin is larger than precipitation and other inflows to the basin. Such conditions are unlikely to have 

existed  in  the  Baltic  Basin  during  the  Quaternary  (e.g.  Wohlfahrt  et  al.,  2008;  Kalm  et  al.,  2011; 

Guobyte and Satkunas, 2011) and evaporative brine formation must therefore date back to Tertiary 

13 

 
times or earlier (> 2.6 Ma ago) when more suitable conditions prevailed in the basin (Jansen et al., 

2007).  Ion-filtration  processes  are  most  efficient  during  burial  of  the  sediment  pile  and  are  thus 

related to the diagenetic phase(s) of the sedimentary basin. Therefore, ion-filtration processes also 

commonly date back to pre-Quaternary times, but may have been re-induced during the Quaternary 

by  the  glacial  overburden.  Cryogenic  enrichment  of  brackish  water  or  seawater  requires  a  cold 

climate and might therefore have occurred during Quaternary times. 

The  chemical  composition  of  deep-seated  groundwater  in  the  CAS  is  most  consistent  with  an 

evaporative  origin  of  the  brine.  An  origin  of  the  brine  purely  from  dissolution  of  halite-bearing 

evaporite  rocks  is  incompatible  with  observed  Na+/Cl−  and  Br−/Cl−  ratios  (cf.  Fig. 2).  Furthermore, 

evaporitic sequences are  known only  from the Permian sediments  but have not been found in the 

CAS (Kalvāns, 2012). Some impacts of mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions including evaporite 

dissolution  are,  however,  present,  as  indicated  by  the  ratios  of  K+/Cl−,  Li+/Cl−,  which  deviate  in 

opposite  directions  from  the  seawater  evaporation  line  (cf.  Fig. 2)  and  the  almost  constant 

(Ca2++Mg2+)/Cl− ratio with a well-developed linear correlation between Ca2+ and Mg2+. Furthermore, 

the  various  mineral  saturation  states  (Table 5)  all  indicate  carbonate,  sulphate,  and  (Al-)silicate 

mineral dissolution  and  precipitation  in addition to evaporative enrichment of seawater. Cryogenic 

formation  of  saline  groundwaters  has  been  documented  for  crystalline  rocks  in  the  Baltic  region 

(Bein and Arad, 1992). However, cryogenic enrichment is incompatible with the observed δ18O–δ2H 

signature  of  the  saline  groundwaters  (Fig. 3)  as  it  would  shift  the  isotope  signature  of  the  residual 

water  to  the  left  of  the  GMWL  (e.g.  Stotler  et  al.,  2012).  Evaporation  shifts  it  to  the  right  of  the 

GMWL, as observed (Fig. 3). Furthermore, cryogenic enrichment of seawater and ion-filtration during 

diagenesis seem incompatible with the observed chemistry in the sedimentary CAS, as these would 

result in different fractionation patterns of dissolved components. 

Different brine formation processes also lead to distinct functional dependencies between noble gas 

concentrations and salinity as shown in Fig. 5 (Greene et al., 2008). In the case of ion-filtration (and 

evaporite  dissolution),  the  initial  noble  gas  concentrations  of  the  seawater  would  be  mainly 

conserved, because the clay acts as a membrane that impedes the passage of ions, but may allow the 

neutral noble gases to pass through together with the water (Appelo and Postma, 1993). Evaporating 

brines remain in contact with the atmosphere during their genesis so that concentrations decrease in 

parallel  to  the  decreasing  solubility  due  to 

increasing  salinity,  resulting 

in 

low  noble  gas 

concentrations. For cryogenic brine formation on the other hand, the overlying ice impedes contact 

with the atmosphere. This isolation results in highly enriched heavy noble gas concentrations in the 

residual water, because they cannot be incorporated into the ice lattice, whereas the lighter isotopes 

(He, Ne) can be incorporated and become depleted in the residual water (Hood et al., 1998; Greene 

14 

 
et  al.,  2008;  Malone  et  al.,  2010).  Thus,  the  decreasing  noble  gas  concentrations  with  increasing 

salinity clearly support an evaporative origin (Fig. 5). In conclusion, based on chemical, stable isotope, 

and noble gas signatures of the most saline groundwaters, the here preferred origin of the brine in 

the BAB is one of evaporated seawater that has later been modified by water-rock interaction and 

diluted by fresh water including glacial meltwater. 

5.1.2.  Chemical Modification of the Brine  

Considering  the  aquifer  mineralogy  (Raidla  et  al.,  2006)  and  the  long  timescales,  in-situ,  all 

groundwaters  are  in  equilibrium  with  respect  to  calcite  and  dolomite.  Modeling  of  the  mineral 

saturation states shows that at calcite saturation, the brine-dominated groundwaters (wells 3 to 7*) 

are  in  equilibrium  with  gypsum  and  celestite,  except  for  the  most  saline  groundwater  from  well  6 

(Genciai). The calculated equilibrium with respect to barite and quartz (Table 5) indicates an evolved 

geochemical  evolution  for  the  brackish  groundwaters  and,  based  on  mineral  dissolution  kinetics, 

suggests  a  considerable,  albeit  significantly  shorter,  residence  time  of  the  groundwater  mixture 

compared to the brine-dominated groundwater mixtures. 

The  modeled  equilibrium  state  of  gypsum  and  celestite  (Table  5)  for  samples  with  a  high  brine 

proportion cannot be explained by dissolution of these minerals within the aquifer itself, as gypsum 

and celestite are not observed in the rocks of the CAS (Raidla et al., 2006). Alternative explanations 

include a brine component that had been equilibrated with gypsum and celestite prior to infiltration 

into the CAS and/or sulfate reduction in the groundwater within the aquifer. For the latter there is 

ample  evidence  from  S-  and  C-isotope  investigations  on  shallower,  less  mineralized  groundwater 

from the CAS (Raidla et al., 2012, 2014) and – for the saline deep groundwaters – also from well 6, 

for which the low SO4

–2 and high organic carbon (TOC) contents (Table 2) indicate sulfate reduction. 

Highly elevated CH4 concentrations in well 6 indicate microbial methanogenesis in addition to sulfate 

reduction.  Such  substantial  sulfate  reduction  results  in  strong  undersaturation  of  this  highest 

mineralized groundwater with respect to SO4-bearing mineral phases (Table 5). This suggests that in 

the bulk of brine-dominated groundwaters, gypsum saturation was reached before infiltration of the 

brine component and  later  dilution  with fresh water types was not efficient enough to deviate the 

groundwater  composition  from  this  equilibrium.  In  line  with  this  is  the  modelled  undersaturation 

with  respect  to  gypsum  and  celestite  in  the  brackish  groundwaters  (wells  1  and  2)  with  a)  much 

higher proportions of freshwater components and b) potential ongoing sulfate reduction as observed 

in shallower groundwater of the CAS (Raidla et al., 2014).  

A  mixing  of  fresh  water,  glacial  meltwater,  and  brine  components  has  been  observed  in  other 

sedimentary basins mainly in North America (e.g. Pearson et al., 1991; McIntosh and Walter, 2006; 

McIntosh et al., 2012), but also for the CAS in Northern Estonia (Raidla et al., 2009). The patterns of 
15 

 
chemical  composition,  saturation  states,  and  stable  isotopes  for  samples  from  the  deeper  parts  of 

the CAS all indicate a common evolution of the collected groundwaters by gradual dilution of a single 

brine end member by fresh water including glacial meltwater. 

5.1.3.  Degassing  

The  low  noble  gas  concentrations  of  wells  3  and  4  indicate  the  occurrence  of  degassing  (Fig.  5). 

Depleted 20Ne/22Ne ratios compared to the atmospheric value (

, Eberhardt et al., 1965) 

for  these  wells  point  to  diffusion-controlled  degassing  (Peeters  et  al.,  2002).  Diffusive  degassing  is 

𝑁𝑒
𝑅𝑎𝑎𝑚

= 9.80

likely  driven  by  gas  stripping  into  a  gas  phase  depleted  in  noble  gases  (e.g.  N2  or  CH4,  similar  to 

Sültenfuss  et  al.,  2011)  in  accordance  with the  negative  ΔNes  values of  wells 3 and  4  (Table  3).  An 

additional complication in our case is the presence of mixing of very distinct water components that 

may have individual degassing histories. Concerning the timing of the degassing, three scenarios are 

possible: a) gas loss during transfer to or storage in the Cu tubes; b) gas stripping during the rise of 

the groundwater in the borehole due to decompression (Late degassing); and c) gas stripping during 

infiltration  of  the  brine  (Early  degassing,  before  mixing)  caused  for  example  by  gases  released  by 

tectonic  activities  or  geochemical  reactions  such  as  denitrification  and  methanogenesis  in  the 

recharge  zone  at  that  time.  Option  a)  is  unlikely  because  Ar  concentrations  determined  from 

sampling  campaigns  II  and  III  generally  show  consistent  results  (see  Fig. A2  in  the  Electronic 

Appendix C). 

Gas stripping in the groundwater body due to decompression and ebullition of oversaturated N2 is a 

well-known mechanism  and  cannot  be  excluded. Such a late degassing process would also  cause a 

loss  of  CO2,  explaining  the  apparent  oversaturation  of  all  sampled  groundwaters  with  respect  to 

calcite when using the pH value measured in the field. However, the fact that the partial pressure of 

CO2 in the samples  calculated  with  the  field pH value is more than one order of magnitude higher 

than that of the atmosphere (Table 5) indicates that degassing during the rise of the groundwater in 

the borehole and sampling was limited. For well 4, the estimated CO2 degassing is 16%, whereas the 
20Ne/22Ne ratio suggests that 67% (n=1) to 81% (n=2/3) of Ne was lost. An early degassing instead of 

a  late  degassing  is  further  supported  by  an  increasing  degree  of  degassing  with  increasing  brine 

proportion,  which  suggests  that  the  brine  had  already  degassed  prior  to  mixing  with  the  other 

groundwater components (see Fig. 5 for a modified mixing model). 

An early degassing of the brine component before the mixing is difficult to quantify today, as most of 

the atmospheric noble gases in the samples today will derive from the other two mixing components, 

even for relatively high brine fractions. A late degassing, in turn, can be estimated and corrected for 

using  Equations 3  and  4.  The  calculated  proportion  f  of  Ne  that  remained  in  the  groundwater 

samples  decreases  from  95-97%  (for  n=2/3  to  1)  to  19-34%  with  increasing  salinity.  Noble  gas 
16 

 
concentrations Ci

0 corrected for a late degassing for n=1 are higher and show better agreement with 

the  mixing  model  for  an  evaporative  origin  of  the  brine  for  the  more  saline  samples,  but  the  light 

noble gases like Ne are corrected too much relative to the heavy noble gases like Xe. Using n=2/3 for 

the degassing correction results in a more balanced correction of light and heavy noble gases (Fig. 5). 

For  the  most  saline  samples,  corrected  concentrations  are  above  the  mixing  model  for  an 

evaporative  brine  origin  in  Fig. 5  and  could  be  explained  similarly  well  by  membrane  filtration. 

However,  these  corrected  values  are  an  upper  limit,  as  the  20Ne/22Ne  isotopic  ratio  could  also  be 

lowered by accumulation of nucleogenically produced Ne with a lower  20Ne/22Ne ratio, discussed in 

detail  in  section  5.3.2.  Assuming  the  brine  component  before mixing  had  a  20Ne/22Ne  ratio  of  9.65 

instead of 9.80 (black mixing line in Fig. 5e) due to nucleogenic production is completely consistent 

with  the  20Ne/22Ne  ratios  measured  in  wells  1,  2,  5,  and  7*.  For  wells  3  and  4,  additional  diffusive 

degassing is still required (59% and 64% of Ne lost, respectively). Degassing corrected concentrations 

in this case are entirely consistent with an evaporative origin of the brine (Fig. 5a-d). 

It  is  worthwhile  to  note  that  neither  incomplete  gas  extraction  during  sampling  nor  timing  or 

mechanism of the degassing affect 81Kr and 39Ar dating or 85Kr significantly because all these methods 

are based on isotope ratios with small mass differences (Purtschert et al., 2013). This is in contrast to 

accumulation ages deduced from radiogenic  4He* and  40Ar*, for which timing and magnitude of the 

degassing are very critical. 

5.2.  Mixing Proportions 

Based on  the  conclusions  so  far,  we  adopt  and extend  the  mixing model  proposed  by  Raidla  et  al. 

(2009) to the deeper parts of the CAS (Fig. 6). In their model, the brine component was assumed to 

be Paleozoic seawater with a Cl– content of 25 g/L and a δ18O value of –2‰ VSMOW. In the present 

study,  the  highest  Cl–  content  of  groundwater  is  90 g/kg  (well 6,  no  noble  gas  data),  which  was 

chosen as an adjusted brine end member composition. The oxygen isotope composition in turn was 

shifted to 0‰ VSMOW to be more consistent with the evaporative genesis of the brine (Fig. 6). It can 

be shown that more enriched or depleted δ18O values (e.g. ±2‰ VSMOW), albeit slightly altering the 

mixing proportions, would not significantly affect the interpretation of the noble gas concentrations 

and of the dating tracers in the next section. As a further simplification, mixing is assumed to be a 

non-fractionating, chemically conservative process. As shown in Fig. 6, the subspace of the modified 

mixing model indeed delineates the observed Cl– and δ18O values of the deep groundwaters from the 

CAS,  except  for  well 6,  and  is  consistent  with  the  proposed  origin  of  the  brine  from  evaporated 

seawater. In terms of groundwater residence times, an evaporated-seawater origin of the brine end 

member  constrains  the  formation  time  of  this  end  member  to  certainly  pre-Quaternary  and  more 

likely even much earlier times. For the glacial meltwater end member in turn, a Pleistocene origin is 

17 

 
plausible. The third component was considered to be of Holocene origin in Northern Estonia (Raidla 

et al., 2009)  and  consequently  was  named “recent”. However, in the deeper  parts of  the CAS, this 

third component  could be  considerably  older, originating from previous interglacial periods.  In this 

paper, it is thus called simply “meteoric” component, even though the glacial component is also of a 

meteoric origin. 

Mixing  proportions 

 of  the  three  end  members  calculated  from  Cl−  and  δ18O  for  each 

groundwater sample from the CAS are given in Table 6. As an extension to here presented data, end-

𝐻2𝑂

𝑓𝑒

member proportions were also calculated for selected samples from Northern Estonia (NE1–NE3, cf. 

Fig. 6), using the δ18O and Cl− values reported by Raidla et al.  (2009). More details on the calculation 

of  the  mixing  proportions  are  provided  in  the  Electronic  Appendix  B.  Four  of  the  seven  deep 

groundwater samples are dominated by the brine component (>50%) and in three of the samples (5–

7*),  the  glacial  meltwater  component  is  absent  or  insignificant  (Table 6).  However,  for  the  most 

saline samples that plot close to the brine end member, the distinction between the dilution of the 

brine by meteoric water and/or glacial meltwater can no longer be adequately resolved due to the 

uncertainty  in  the  exact  signature  of  the  brine  end  member.  Fig. 7  shows  that  glacial  meltwater 

intruded the CAS mostly in the northern part of the BAB (Estonia), i.e. north of the fault zone, and did 

not reach Lithuania. In turn, the brine proportion is highest in wells in the deeper central part of the 

BAB and lower towards the boundaries of the BAB where the CAS is closer to the surface. 

The mixing proportions 

 of krypton, which are needed for the interpretation of the 81Kr data, are 

then  calculated  using  Equation 7,  based  on  the 
𝑓𝑒

𝐾𝑎

 and  the  Kr  concentrations  of  the  three  end 

members. Noble gas concentrations of the end members were estimated in the following way: For 
𝑓𝑒
the meteoric water, an infiltration temperature of 5°C, an elevation of the recharge area of 200 masl, 

𝐻2𝑂

unfractionated  excess  air  corresponding  to  ΔNe=25%,  and  negligible  salinity  were  assumed.  The 

noble  gas  concentrations  for  the  glacial  end  member  are  based  on  the  median  of  concentrations 

measured in samples from Northern Estonia with a clear glacial meltwater signature in the isotope 

composition  (Weißbach,  2014,  for  numerical  values  see  Electronic  Appendix  B).  The  noble  gas 

signature  of  the  brine  end  member  is  chosen  as  AEW  at  a  salinity  of  163 g/kg  (corresponding  to 

90 g/kg  of  Cl−  for  seawater-like  composition)  and  a  temperature  of  25°C.  For  Kr,  the  respective 

concentrations  are  11·10-8,  19·10-8,  and  2·10-8 cm3STP/g  for  meteoric  water,  glacial  meltwater,  and 

brine. The resulting noble gas concentration-Cl– mixing subspace, as denoted by the mixing lines in 

Fig. 5, is consistent with the measured pattern, with the exception of wells 3 and 4, for which a noble 

gas  deficit  is  observed.  This  deficit  is  attributed  to  degassing  of  the  groundwater.  For  a  degassing 

during  the  genesis  of  the  brine,  this  would  lead  to  a  lower  noble  gas  content  of  the  brine  end 

member  and  consequently  shifted  mixing  lines  (Fig.  5).  For  a  degassing  during  the  rise  of  the 

18 

 
groundwater  in  the  borehole,  the  correction  for  diffusive  degassing  in  Equations  3  and  4  bring  the 

wells 3 and 4 in better alignment with the unmodified mixing lines. A direct comparison of modelled 

Kr concentrations with measured concentrations is provided in Electronic Appendix B. 

5.3.  Groundwater Residence Times 

5.3.1.  81Kr Ages (of the glacial and meteoric water) 

In  the  CAS,  (apparent)  81Kr  ages  range  from  319 ka  to  more  than  1.3 Ma  (Table 7).  The  positive 

correlation  between  81Kr  ages  and  brine  proportions  implies  that  the  brine  is  the  oldest  water 

component, that is, older than 1.3 Ma – outside the dating range of 81Kr. This is the first time that 81Kr 

groundwater ages beyond the  81Kr dating range are reported. For the deconvolution of ages, it can 

thus be assumed that Rbrine/Rair < 0.02 ≈ 0, which reduces the number of unknowns in Equation 7 by 

one. For samples not containing any glacial meltwater, the meteoric component can thus be dated. 

To deconvolute the 81Kr ages, it is very important to consider the Kr proportions fi’ (see Equation 7), 

which  are  quite  different  from  the  water  proportions  (Fig. 7).  Due  to  the  low  noble  gas 

concentrations in the brine, the meteoric and glacial components dominate the budget of noble gas 

isotopic  tracers  like  81Kr  even  for  relatively  high  brine  water  proportions.  Therefore,  the  81Kr  age 

mainly  represents  the  age  of  the  meteoric  water  and  glacial  meltwater  components,  except  for 

samples with very high brine proportions. This distinction between water proportions and noble gas 

proportions  is  often  not  made  when  analyzing  isotopic  tracers,  but  is  crucial  for  a  correct 

interpretation of 81Kr in this study. 

Residence times of the meteoric and glacial components are unlikely to be constant throughout the 

whole  CAS,  due  to  the  highly  variable  thickness  of  the  overburden,  the  large  spatial  extent  and  a 

predominately  horizontal  flow  (at  least today).  However,  well-specific  Rglacial  and  Rmeteoric  mean  that 

Equation 7 is underdetermined when only using 81Kr. Thus, for the wells containing glacial meltwater, 

especially wells 1 and 2, further assumptions are required. For example, it could be assumed that all 

the glacial meltwater originates from the last deglaciation and is therefore between 10 and 25 ka old. 

However, this would result in negative 81Kr abundances of the meteoric component Rmeteoric, which is 

physically impossible. Therefore, the glacial component must be a mixture of meltwater from at least 

the last two glaciations implying that water from (the) previous glacial period(s) was not completely 

flushed from the CAS during the last interglacial period. To solve Equation 7, it is thus assumed that 

the  glacial  meltwater  and  the  meteoric  water  in  any  one  well  have  approximately  the  same  age, 

resulting  in  81Krm  ages  of  the  meteoric  and  glacial  components  that  are  similar  to  the  81Kr  ages, 

ranging from 300 ka to over 1.3 Ma (Table 7). Because only a lower age limit of 1.3 Ma can be given 

19 

 
for the brine, only a lower limit can be given for tmix (Equation 6), which ranges from 400 ka to 1.3 Ma 

(Table 7). 

5.3.2.  He, Ne, and Ar Accumulation Ages (of the brine) 

The  very  old  groundwater  ages  deduced  from  81Kr  are  also  supported  by  the  elevated  4He 

concentrations  and  40Ar/36Ar  ratios  in  samples 3, 4, and  7  (cf.  Table 3, Torgersen  and  Stute,  2013). 

Especially such elevated 40Ar/36Ar ratios are typically only observed in very old water with residence 

times  of  at  least  several  hundred  ka  due  to  accumulation  of  radiogenic  40Ar.  The  radiogenic 

component, 40Ar*, can be calculated by (Aeschbach-Hertig and Solomon, 2012):

Nucleogenic production of Ne also leads to an accumulation of both  20Ne and  22Ne (Kennedy et al., 

1990, Ballentine and Burnard, 2002). The amount of 20Ne* can be estimated by:

 is the atmospheric 20Ne/22Ne ratio of 9.80 and p22/p20 is the nucleogenic production ratio 

⋅

of the two isotopes. All three equations neglect gas loss and isotopic fractionation in the subsurface 

e.g. during degassing. For a late degassing, measured values first have to be corrected for degassing 

using  Equations 3  and  4.  An  early  degassing  would  have  a  negligible  effect  on  4He*  and  40Ar* 

estimations,  but  lead  to  a  considerable  overestimation  of  20Ne*  when  using  Equation 11  as  the 

degassing would lower the initial 20Ne/22Ne ratio. 

Crustal 4He*/40Ar* production ratios in the rocks of ~3.4 were calculated according to Ballentine and 

Burnard (2002) with K, U, and Th concentrations for the CAS from the literature: Raidla et al. (2006) 

(K2Oeq = 4% in Estonia) and Shogenova et al. (2003) (3% K, 1.5 ppm U and 7 ppm Th in three samples 
from  Lithuania).  All  water  samples  show  higher  4He*/40Ar*  ratios  than  the  production  ratio  in  the 

rock (up to 4.5 times the production ratio, see Fig. 8a). This is attributed to preferential release of the 

smaller  and  lighter  4He  from  the  host  minerals  (Mamyrin  and  Tolstikhin,  1984;  Ballentine  et  al., 

1994). The higher the temperature, the higher the likelihood that the produced atoms are released 

into the water-filled pore space.  The closure temperature above which most atoms are released is 

between 200 and 300°C for  40Ar and ~100°C for  4He (Ballentine and Burnard, 2002). Depending on 

20 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
the  in-situ  temperature  and  on  the  grain  size  distribution  of  the  U  and  K  bearing  minerals, 

considerably higher 4He*/40Ar* ratios are possible. 

For an estimation of 20Ne*, the production ratio of 20Ne*/22Ne* is required, which is very sensitive to 

the O/F ratio of the rocks contributing the Ne. The average crustal value is O/F=752 (Ballentine and 

Burnard,  2002),  but  Kennedy  et  al.  (1990)  suggested  that  O/F=113  is  more  appropriate  for  the 

mineral  environment  in  which  the  U  and  Th  are  typically  sited.  Based  on  Ballentine  and  Burnard 
(2002)  and  using  K,  U,  and  Th  as  given  above,  a  Ne  production  ratio  p22/p20 =19.53  is obtained  for 

O/F=113 and the estimated 20Ne* ranges from 1.0 to 5.5·10-12 cc/g. For O/F=752, the production ratio 

is 2.942, which also results in ~7 times higher 20Ne*. Comparing the estimated 20Ne* to 4He* excludes 

O/F=752 as some samples already contain more 20Ne* than expected with O/F=113 (assuming 100% 

of produced Ne is released, see Fig. 8b). In fact, to explain the apparent 4He*/20Ne* ratio of sample 4, 

the  O/F  ratio  would  have  to  be  as  high  as  45.  In  other  words,  either the  O/F  ratio  or  the  released 

fraction of Ne have to vary by a factor of over 2.5 in the CAS. 

Alternatively, degassing, which has not been taken into account so far, might be responsible for the 

differences in estimated 4He*/20Ne* ratios. Solubility-controlled degassing has only a relatively small 

effect on the  4He*/20Ne* ratio, even if the degassing happened after the accumulation (Fig. 8b) and 

for  20Ne*/40Ar*  the  effect  is  actually  in  the  wrong  direction  (Fig. 8c).  An  early  diffusive  degassing 

(before  the  accumulation  started)  does  not  affect  4He*  and  40Ar*significantly  but  would  result  in  a 

reduced initial  20Ne/22Ne ratio. This results in an overestimation of the produced  20Ne* when using 

Equation 11. The initial 20Ne/22Ne ratio can be calculated from the 20Ne* value obtained when tracing 

the red line (parallel to the production line) in Fig. 8b to 4He*=0. The “apparent” initial 20Ne* is 3.6E-

12  cc/g  for  wells  3  and  4,  corresponding  to  an  initial  20Ne/22Ne  ratio  of  9.75  instead  of  9.80.  The 

effect  of  late  degassing  (during  the  ascent  in  the  well)  is  also  shown  in  Fig. 8.  The  underlying 

assumption  is  that,  at  first,  radiogenic  and  nucleogenic  production  increase  4He*,  20Ne*,  and  40Ar* 

along  the  (release-modified)  in-situ  production  lines.  Then,  diffusion-  or  solubility-controlled 

degassing  according  to  Equations 3  and  4  takes  place  and  finally,  3He*,  20Ne*,  and  40Ar*  are 

calculated  according  to  Equations  9-11.  Interestingly,  during  the  degassing,  the  “apparent”  20Ne* 

increases initially, before it starts decreasing. The reason is that the degassing reduces not only the 

Ne concentration in the groundwater, resulting in less “apparent”  20Ne*, but at the same time also 

reduces the  20Ne/22Ne ratio, resulting in more  “apparent”  20Ne*. The first effect dominates if more 

than 50% of the Ne is lost, whereas the second effect dominates initially, until 50% of the Ne is lost. 

Fig. 8b  shows  that  samples  3  and  4  lost  ~55%  and  ~60%  of  the  initial  Ne  by  diffusive  degassing, 

respectively.  Fig. 8a  gives  a  similar  value  for  well 4,  but  shows  no  significant  degassing  for  well 3. 

However, the result from Fig. 8b is more robust, as it is independent of the only weakly constrained 

21 

 
release  fraction  of  40Ar*.  The  degrees  degassing  estimated  from  Fig. 8b  are  very  close  to  those 

estimated  based  on  the  20Ne/22Ne  ratios  as  a  function  of  salinity  in  section  5.1.3  and  Fig. 5e.  They 

thus also lead to very similar corrections for the noble gas concentrations in Fig. 5a-d, consistent with 

an evaporative origin of the brine. In summary, the measured  20Ne/22Ne ratios of wells 3 and 4 are 

most consistent with a combination of diffusive degassing and nucleogenic production with O/F=113. 

Early  and  late  degassing  both  seem  possible,  but  they  differ  considerably  in  the  amount  of  4He*, 

20Ne*,  and  40Ar*  accumulated  in  samples 3  and  4.  Unfortunately,  concentrations  of  21Ne  and  38Ar, 

which would provide much better constraints on the relative importance of nucleogenic production 

and mass fractionation, were not measured. 

The concentrations of 4He*, 20Ne*, and 40Ar* are often used as qualitative dating tools because their 

absolute  accumulation  rates  r  are  difficult  to  determine.  Qualitatively,  the  4He*,  20Ne*,  and  40Ar* 

systematics  agree  with  the  conclusions  drawn  from  81Kr  activities:  The  three wells  with  higher  81Kr 

ages  (wells  3,  4,  and  7*)  also  exhibit  higher  4He*  and  40Ar*  concentrations  (see  Table  3  and  7).  In 

several  studies,  the  4He*  accumulation  rate  was  calibrated  using  14C  (Torgersen  and  Clarke,  1985; 

Marty  et  al.,  1993)  or  81Kr  (Lehmann  et  al.,  2003;  Purtschert  et  al.,  2013;  Aggarwal  et  al.,  2015). 

However,  this  approach  is  problematic  here,  because  81Kr  mainly  dates  the  meteoric  and  glacial 

component, whereas a large proportion of the 4He*, 20Ne*, and 40Ar* originates from the older brine 

component. Therefore,  4He*,  20Ne*, and  40Ar* concentrations are related to the proportion of brine 

water (fbrine), as shown in Fig. 9, rather than to the groundwater ages deduced from 81Kr. For wells 3 

and  4,  uncorrected  values,  values  corrected  for  an  early  degassing  and  values  corrected  for  a  late 

degassing  are  shown.  The  expected  linear  relationships  of  4He*,  20Ne*,  and  40Ar*  with  the  brine 

fraction fit best with the late-degassing values, providing further evidence for a late degassing. 

Ranges  of  4He*,  20Ne*,  and  40Ar*  concentrations  of  the  meteoric/glacial  component  and  the  brine 

end member are estimated by extrapolating the linear fit in Fig. 9 to a brine proportion of 0 and 1, 

respectively: 

<1.5·10−4 cm3 (STP)/gwater 

and 

1.72·10−3 cm3 (STP)/gwater 

for 

4He*, 

<1.5·10−12 cm3 (STP)/gwater  and  6.8·10−12 cm3 (STP)/gwater  for  20Ne*,  and  <2.0·10−5 cm3 (STP)/gwater  and 
9.1·10−5 cm3 (STP)/gwater for  40Ar*. The deduced ratios of  4He*/20Ne*,  4He*/40Ar*, and  20Ne*/40Ar* of 

the brine component are close to the respective ratios of in-situ production rates. 

A calibration of 4He*, 20Ne*, and 40Ar* accumulation rates by means of 81Kr data is limited to samples 

where the brine proportion is small (wells 1 and 2), because groundwater ages deduced from 81Kr do 

not  capture  the  brine  age.  The  81Kr  age  scale  shown  Fig. 9  is  based  on  the  mixed  81Kr  ages  (tmix, 

Equation 6) of samples 1 and 2 (Table 7). These are minimal age estimates since the brine component 

might be older than 1.3 Ma. For comparison, age scales corresponding to in-situ production and an 

external influx (Torgersen and Clarke, 1985) are also shown. In-situ production rates (assuming 100% 
22 

 
release) were calculated according to Ballentine and Burnard (2002) for a rock density of 2.7 g/cm3 

and a porosity of 5% (porosity of the shallow parts of the CAS is 20% or more, but has been reduced 

to less than 5% in 2000 m depth by sediment compaction (Raidla et al., 2006)). Accumulation rates 

for an external influx were estimated based on crustal fluxes reported by Torgersen (2010) for  4He* 

and Torgersen et al. (1989) for 40Ar* and assuming that the top of the CAS is impermeable (i.e. no gas 

is lost to overlying strata). The 20Ne* flux was calculated based on the 4He* flux and the 20Ne*/4He* 

production ratio. On the 81Kr-calibrated age scale, 4He*, 20Ne*, and 40Ar* ages of the meteoric/glacial 

component  are  <450 ka,  <650 ka  and  <1.0 Ma,  respectively.  The  81Kr-calibrated  4He*,  20Ne*,  and 

40Ar* ages of the brine component in turn are 5.0±0.8 Ma, 3.0±0.6 Ma, and 4.5±1.3 Ma, respectively. 

Overall,  4He*  and  40Ar*  qualitatively  support the groundwater ages deduced from  81Kr and suggest 

that  the  brine  is  pre-Quaternary,  in  line  with  the  evaporative  origin  of  the  brine  proposed  in 

section 5.1.1. 

5.4.  Recharge Dynamics and Flow Pattern 

5.4.1.  Spatial Pattern of 81Kr Ages and He and Ar Accumulation Ages  

The 81Krm ages of the meteoric and glacial water show a higher correlation with depth below surface 

(Fig. 10b) than with distance from the present day recharge area in the southeast (Fig. 10a). This is 

the  combined  result  of  (i)  the  concave  shape  of  the  basin,  translating  horizontal  movement  into  a 

vertical stratification and (ii) the present-day distribution of 81Kr ages reflecting net groundwater flow 

direction and velocity over the last 1 Ma, integrating over several glacial cycles with complex changes 

of the hydraulic regime. The correlation with depth does not mean, however, that the groundwater 

is stagnant, as diffusion would be too slow to transport enough 81Kr downwards.  

A similar spatial pattern as for  81Krm is also observed for  4He* and  40Ar*. The observed patterns can 

be explained neither by the flow pattern implied by the present-day hydraulic heads nor by assuming 

that  the  water  is  essentially  stagnant  on  time  scales  of  several  hundred  thousands  of  years.  This 

implies  that  either  flow  patterns  have  been  different  in  the  past,  possibly  due  to  hydraulic 

reorganization during glaciations (Person et al., 2007), or that vertical exchange between the CAS and 

overlying formations is much larger at least in some areas, resulting in a more complex present-day 

flow pattern than the one presented so far. 

An  aquifer  as  large  as  the  CAS  will  take  a  considerable  time  to  adjust  to  the  change  in  hydraulic 

(head)  conditions.  Rousseau-Gueutin  et  al.  (2013)  proposed  a  method  to  estimate  the  time  tNE 

needed for an aquifer to reach a near-steady state (NE = near-equilibrium) following a large hydraulic 

perturbation. For a confined aquifer with horizontal flow, it is 

23 

 
2                                                                           (12)
tNE is thereby defined as the time after an initial perturbation dissipated by an average of 95% across 

𝑡𝑁𝑁 = 3 ∙

2
4𝑆𝑠𝐿
𝐾ℎ𝜋

the aquifer. L  is the  aquifer length  (650 km),  Kh the hydraulic conductivity (2.95 m/day in the CAS), 

and Ss the specific storage. According to Domenico and Mifflin (1965), the specific storage of material 

from  dense  sand  to  fissured  rock  is  on  the order of  10−4 m−1.  These  numbers result  in  a  relaxation 

time of  tNe ~50 ka suggesting that the CAS is probably still recovering from the last glaciation. With 

two changes of hydraulic conditions during each full glacial cycle of ~100 ka, the CAS was in transient 

states  for  most  of  the  time  over  the  last  1  Ma.  Long  relaxation  times  act  as  a  low  pass  filter, 

dampening and delaying the system’s response to changing hydraulic conditions. 

5.4.2.  Transient Groundwater Flow Over Several Glacial Cycles 

The purpose of this section is to present a simple conceptual model of groundwater flow over several 

glacial  cycles  that  is  in  accordance  with  the  observed  tracer  data  and  its  spatial  patterns.  The 

simplified  conceptual  model  assumes  that  the  Ordovician-Silurian  (O-S)  aquiclude  is  impermeable, 

isolating  the  CAS  completely  except  in  the  recharge  and  discharge  zones  in  the  southeast  and  the 

Baltic  Sea.  In  light  of  the  complexity  and  size  of  the  CAS  and  the  small  number  of  81Kr  samples,  it 

would  not  be  sound  to  draw  detailed  or  quantitative  conclusions  from  the  conceptual  model. 

However,  we  believe  that  the  conceptual  model  is  valuable  in  recommending  relevant  future 

research directions to better understand long-term groundwater flow in the CAS. 

Hydrogeochemical studies (Vaikmäe et al., 2008; Raidla et al., 2009), noble gas studies (Vaikmäe et 

al., 2001), and hydrodynamic modeling (Saks et al., 2012) suggest the intrusion of glacial meltwater – 

most  likely  in  the  outcrop  area  (Raidla  et  al., 2012;  Saks et  al.,  2012)  and  probably  through  buried 

valleys  in  Northern  Estonia  (Vaikmäe  et  al.,  2001)  –  and  a  regional  reversal  of  the  flow  direction 

during the last glaciation. Such an intrusion may be the reason for the relatively young 81Krm ages of 

the  glacial  and  meteoric  component  in  wells  1  and 2.  Studies  in other  regions  across  the  northern 

hemisphere found that glacial water may reach depths of up to 1000 m and smaller aquifers can be 

flushed in a few ka because of the significantly higher hydraulic gradients during the LGM (Boulton et 

al., 1996; Piotrowski, 1997; Lemieux et al., 2008; Lemieux and Sudicky, 2010; McIntosh et al., 2012). 

However, due to the large size of the BAB, one glacial cycle is insufficient to flush the whole system 

(Saks  et  al.,  2012).  Over  several  glacial  cycles,  multiple  reversals  of  the  flow  direction  in  the  CAS 

occurred (blue arrows in Fig. 10a). 

Conceptually,  throughout  a  glacial  cycle,  four  stages  of  glacial  overburden  and  groundwater  flow 

patterns can be distinguished in the CAS (Fig. 11). Stage 1 (interglacial) represents the present-day 

24 

 
 
situation with recharge in the southeast and discharge in the northwest of the BAB. Stage 2 prevails 

at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  glaciation,  when  the  present-day  discharge  area  in  the  north  is 

covered by ice, but the fault zone is still ice-free. In case of vertical leakage across the fault zone, it 

now acts as a discharge zone because of the highly elevated hydraulic head underneath the ice sheet. 

In case of no leakage, the flow pattern is identical to stage 3, which is reached when the fault zone is 

also  ice  covered.  At  this  point,  the  aquifer  system  discharges  to  the  present-day  recharge  area, 

whereas recharge takes place below the glacier. The increasing lithostatic pressure from the glacier 

might reduce the conductivity of the fractures in the fault zone, reducing vertical leakage or blocking 

it completely (Saks et al., 2012). In Stage 4, the whole BAB is covered by ice and groundwater flow is 

driven by the hydrostatic pressure at the ice sheet base, which follows ice sheet topography. Stage 4 

was  probably  not  reached  during  the  last  glaciation  (Weichselian),  but  was  so  during  the  Saalian 

(Guobyte and Satkunas, 2011). During deglaciation, the stages are passed through in reverse order. 

For simplicity, the effects of permafrost on groundwater flow are not discussed in detail here (see for 

example Boulton et al., 1996; Lemieux et al., 2008; McIntosh et al., 2012; for the BAB: Jõeleht, 1998; 

Zuzevicius, 2010; Saks et al., 2012). The interrelations between permafrost, glaciers and groundwater 

flow  are  complex,  but  will  likely  not  significantly  change  the  conceptual  model  presented  above, 

other than some stages lasting for a slightly longer or shorter time. 

The  net  flow  rate  of  this  conceptual  model  over  the  last  1 Ma  depends  on  the  balance  between 

volumetric fluxes in the present-day flow direction and in the reverse direction integrated over a full 

glacial  cycle.  A  reconstruction  of  the  ice  sheet  extent  during  the  last  glacial  cycle  based  on 

lithostratigraphical,  biostratigraphical,  and  geochronological  information  (Guobyte  and  Satkunas, 

2011) provides evidence that stages 2 and 3 were prevalent for considerable periods during the last 

glacial  cycle.  The  temperature-corrected  global  marine  δ18O  record,  which  is  a  proxy  for  global  ice 

volume, indicates that over the last 1 Ma, several glaciations occurred with similar or even larger ice 

volumes  (Shakun  et  al.,  2015).  Furthermore,  a  shorter  duration  of  the  stages  with  reverse  flow 

direction might be compensated for by higher volumetric fluxes during these stages due to the larger 

hydraulic gradients during the reversed flow (Jõeleht, 1998). Finally, if the integrated volumetric flux 

in one of the two directions dominates markedly, a continuous increase of groundwater ages in the 

net  flow  direction  results,  which  is  in  conflict  with  the  observed  pattern  of  81Krm  ages.  With 

integrated volumetric fluxes of a similar magnitude in both directions, a back-and-forth movement 

results.  The  resulting  integrated  net  flux  and  net  seepage  velocity  in  the  direction  with  the  larger 

volumetric flux is thus  smaller  than the average modulus of the instantaneous volumetric flux rate 

and seepage velocity. This would explain why our 81Krm ages suggest a smaller seepage velocity than 

the  one  deduced  by  Virbulis  et  al.  (2013,  Fig.  10c).  Even  for  a  zero  net  flux,  there  is  still  a  81Kr 

25 

 
concentration  gradient  and  transport  of  81Kr  due  to  dispersion.  A  rough  estimate  shows  that  a 

dispersivity of ~10km could potentially reproduce the 81Krm ages (Fig. 10c.). 

So far, it was assumed that the CAS only gains or loses water in the current recharge and discharge 

areas  only.  However,  topography  driven  recharge  and  discharge  fluxes  on  sub-basin  scales  (Tóth, 

1963),  and  especially  vertical  exchange  across  the  Liepāja-Pskov  fault  zone  might  also  occur.  The 

reduced net flux resulting from the back-and-forth movement of our conceptual model indicates that 

even relatively small leakage fluxes might be relevant for the long-term water budget (purple arrows 

in Fig. 10a). 

Overall,  there  is  some  evidence  from  our  data  that  flow  patterns  in  the  past  differed  significantly 

from the present-day pattern, with reversed flow during glaciations. Furthermore, the system must 

have been in a transient state for much of the last 1 Ma. Finally, understanding flow in the Liepāja-

Pskov  fault  zone  and  other  (even  relatively  small)  leakage  fluxes  is  crucial  for  an  improved 

understanding  of  the  flow  pattern  in  the  CAS  as  a  whole.  Apart  from  further  modelling  attempts, 

sampling additional wells for 81Kr dating along a flow line from the Belarus-Masurian Anticline to the 

Baltic Sea and from the fault zone towards the Moscow Basin would help to test our hypotheses. 

6.  Conclusions 

In this study of the Cambrian Aquifer System in the Baltic Artesian Basin, chemistry, stable isotopes, 

noble  gases,  and  dating  tracers  were  combined  for  a  better  understanding  of  flow  and  recharge 

dynamics  of  the  system  over  the  last  one  million  years.  We  find  that  the  variability  in  chemical 

composition, stable isotopes and noble gas concentrations in the basin is predominately controlled 

by  mixing  of  three  distinct  water  masses:  Holocene  and  Pleistocene  interglacial  meteoric  water, 

glacial  meltwater,  and  a  brine  end  member.  Thanks  to  its  inertness,  constant  atmospheric  input 

function, and its insensitivity to degassing,  81Kr turns out to be a nearly ideal dating tracer for such 

old  waters.  This  is  the  first  groundwater  study  with  81Kr  activities  below  the  detection  limit  of  the 

ATTA-3 instrument, currently at 2% of the atmospheric  81Kr/Kr ratio. Our results confirm that under 

normal conditions, underground production of  81Kr is not affecting the  81Kr dating results. However, 

the differing noble gas concentrations of the different water components, in particular the depleted 

noble  gas  concentrations  of  the  brine,  have  to  be  considered  when  interpreting  measured  81Kr 

activities in terms of groundwater age. Diffusive loss of 81Kr to stagnant water is another process that 

might affect groundwater ages deduced from  81Kr (Purtschert et al., 2013; Sturchio et al., 2014) but 

was neglected in this study because of the relatively high porosity and large thickness of the CAS. The 

radiogenic  4He* and  40Ar* concentrations provide additional age information, but are more difficult 

26 

 
to interpret. Qualitatively they support and complement the age structure derived from the 81Kr data 

as they “date” mainly the brine component, which is beyond the dating range of 81Kr. 

The dating tracers  81Kr,  4He*,  and  40Ar*  indicate a residence  time of the brine component of more 

than 1–5 Ma. Some uncertainty about the brine formation process remains, but the combination of 

chemical  and  stable  isotope  composition  of  the  brine,  noble  gas  concentrations  and  dating  results 

favors  evaporative  enrichment  of  seawater,  implying  a  pre-Quaternary  origin  of  the  brine.  Tracer 

ages of meteoric water and glacial meltwater are on the order of several hundred thousand years, so 

that  the  possibility  of  multiple  reversals of the  flow direction  in  the  Cambrian Aquifer  System  as  a 

result of the paleoclimatology of the area has to be taken into account. Under such conditions, small 

vertical leakage,  through  fracture  zones for example, might have a considerable impact on the net 

flow  pattern.  Due  to  the  cyclic  changes  in  hydraulic  conditions  and  potential  reversals  of  flow 

direction,  the  aquifer  was  probably  in  a  transient  state  over  most  of  the  last  1 Ma  period,  which 

needs to be considered in future modeling attempts. 

The conclusions we can draw are limited by the small number of samples from the deeper parts of 

the  aquifer  system.  Furthermore,  an  improved  modelling  approach  concerning the  faults  and their 

effect on flow dynamics could help to test different potential explanations of the spatial age pattern 

found in this study. More research is also needed on the role of permafrost in blocking recharge or 

discharge pathways. Finally, noble gas measurements from Estonia, where the proportion of glacial 

meltwater is high, noble gas derived infiltration temperatures and stable isotopes could be used to 

differentiate  the  glacial  recharge  mechanism  (basal  melting  or  surficial  meltwater)  as  Grundl  et  al. 

(2013)  have  done  for  groundwater  recharged  from  the  Laurentide  Ice  Sheet  in  southeastern 

Wisconsin.

(modified after Virbulis et al., 2013). Figure a) denotes the extent of the Cambrian aquifer system 

(CAS, thick black line) with the dashed parts indicating the aquifer outcrop areas. The thick gray line 

along the Belarus-Masurian Anticline shows the extent of the Scandinavian ice sheet during the last 

glacial maximum (Kalm, 2012). Figures b) and c) are cross-sections of the BAB along the fine dashed 

lines in 1a), showing the hydrogeological setting of the studied wells (200x vertical exaggeration). 

Vertical thin lines sketch the major faults. As a reminder that well 7* is the only well located in the 

overlying Devonian aquifer, it is marked with a star throughout the paper.

lines) and enriched by evaporation (dotted lines) assuming present-day average seawater 

composition.

Figure 5: a)–d) Measured concentrations (solid diamonds) of atmosphere-derived noble gas isotopes 

and e) Ne isotopic ratios versus Cl−, which is a proxy for the brine proportion. The evolution of noble 

gas concentrations during brine genesis depends strongly on the brine formation process (dashed 

and dotted black lines). Noble gas concentrations for air-equilibrated water (long dashed lines) are 

calculated according to Smith and Kennedy (1983) for various temperatures. Solid black lines in a) to 

d) show the range of concentrations expected for a mixing of the three end members (squares, 

numerical values of the noble gas signatures for the three end members are listed in the Electronic 

Appendix B) with and without degassing prior to mixing. Noble gas concentrations corrected for 

degassing according to Equations 3 and 4 (based on the 20Ne/22Ne ratio and assuming the degassing 

happened after mixing) are depicted as open diamonds. Taking into account the possibility of 

46 

 
 
nucleogenic production of 20Ne and 22Ne for the brine end member results in the mixing line shown 

in e). In this case, the degassing correction for samples 3 and 4 in a) to d) is smaller and degassing is 

negligible for the rest of the samples. 

Figure 6: Relation between Cl− and δ18O, allowing the identification of end members (EM) based on 

the mixing model proposed by Raidla et al. (2009). The new data (filled symbols) result in an 

adjustment of the brine end member compared to that proposed by Raidla et al. (2009) based on 

samples from Northern Estonia (open symbols), without interfering with the proposed general 

mixing behavior of the less saline groundwaters. Also shown are the standard mean ocean water 

(SMOW) and the compositional range of evaporating paleo seawater. The change in δ18O during 

evaporative enrichment is calculated using the equation provided in Ferronsky (2015) for an 

evaporating reservoir without recharge at 25°C, with the kinetic fractionation calculated according to 

Gat et al. (2001). The shaded area represents a range of atmospheric conditions (isotopic 

47 

 
 
 
composition of atmospheric water vapor δa and relative humidity h) during evaporation from 

δa=−20‰ and h = 0.65 to δa=−13‰ and h = 0.5 (corresponding to conditions reported for the 

Mediterranean (Gat et al., 2003). The measurement uncertainty is generally smaller than the symbol 

size. Numerical values of the Cl− and δ18O signatures for the three end members are listed in the 

Electronic Appendix B.

accumulation  lines  for  in-situ  production  and  partial  release  of  40Ar*  into  the  water  phase  (black 

lines).  Orange  lines  and  the  blue  line  represent  the  apparent  changes  in  4He*,  20Ne*,  and  40Ar* 

resulting from  a late  degassing  (diffusion-controlled and solubility-controlled, respectively),  starting 

from  sample 7  or  from  hypothetical  samples  with  the  same  accumulation  ratio  but  50%  and  100% 

higher concentrations. The thin orange lines and numbers refer to the remaining Ne fraction in the 

water during the course of the degassing (e.g. 40% to 45% of initial Ne in b) for wells 3 and 4). An 

early  degassing  and  the  subsequent  accumulation  of  4He*,  20Ne*,  and  40Ar*  is  shown  by  the  red 

dashed line in b). An early diffusive degassing shifts the  20Ne/22Ne ratio away from the atmospheric 

ratio, resulting in a significant amount of apparent 20Ne* before accumulation begins.

Black symbols refer to uncorrected values whereas open symbols are concentrations corrected for an 

early degassing (saline samples only) and red symbols are concentrations corrected for a late 

degassing as determined from Fig. 8. Based on a linear fit of the values corrected for early degassing 

(black line, the gray shading indicates the 1σ-uncertainty), concentrations in pure brine and the 

meteoric/glacial components are estimated (brown squares). On the right side, age scales for in-situ 

production, an accumulation rate based on 81Kr ages of wells 1 and 2, and an external crustal flux are 

shown.

demise of the ice sheet. In the shallow aquifers (dashed arrows), and the fault zone, flow is mainly 

driven by topography during interglacial periods. Once covered by ice, we assume that the fault zone 

has negligible influence on water flows and flow is mainly driven by ice sheet topography.

A.  Fieldwork and Contamination Correction 

The seven sampling locations of this study (Fig. 1a, Table 1) were selected based on low radiocarbon 

activities  from  previous  campaigns.  Four  of  the  wells  (1–4)  are  artesian;  otherwise,  submersible 

pumps  were  used  for  sampling.  During  sampling,  any  water  treatment  (e.g.  any  admixture  of 

additives) in actively used wells was paused. 

Contamination  from  leakage  could  occur  in  the  well  due  to  a  corroded  well  casing  or  in  the  gas 

extraction or noble gas separation system, although the extraction system was tested for leaks prior 

to  and  during  sampling.  Contamination  detection  is  based  on  85Kr,  since  the  deep  waters  are 

presumably older than 60 years and thus 85Kr-free (Sturchio et al., 2014):

given  in  Table  4.  Only  well 6  seems  to  be  substantially  contaminated  (12%).  Contamination  with 

atmospheric  air  during  sampling  only  affects  the  gas  tracers  of  campaign  II  (85Kr,  81Kr,  and  39Ar). 

Intrusion  of  relatively  young  water,  on  the  other  hand,  would  also  affect  all  other  parameters 

measured in  the  different  campaigns.  Contamination by shallow groundwater through a leaky well 

casing could be underestimated, depending on the groundwater residence time: If the water is very 
young, 85Krcont is similar to the atmospheric 78.5 dpm/ccKr. For older water, some of the 85Kr will have 

decayed  already,  resulting  in  an  underestimation  of  the  admixed  fraction  of  young  water.  This 

underestimation  results  in  an  overestimation  of  the  true  81Kr  abundance.  Because  it  is  difficult  to 

separate  the  two  processes  and  because  there  is  no  simple  proxy  of  contamination  for  the  other 

sampling campaigns, only 81Kr and 39Ar data were corrected.  

B.  Mixing Calculations 

The mixing proportions given in Table 6 in the main text were determined based on mass 

conservation for δ18O and Cl− and end member signatures as listed in Table A1. A Monte-Carlo 

simulation was performed (n=10’000) to determine the uncertainties of the calculated mixing 

 
 
 
 
 
  
proportions. The end member compositions for δ18O, Cl–, and 81Kr were assumed to be uniformly 

distributed within the ranges given in Table A1. For the measurements, normally distributed 

uncertainties with a standard deviation of 0.5‰ VSMOW, 5%, and values as reported in Table 4 were 

used for δ18O, Cl–, and 81Kr, respectively. For end-member proportions close to 0 or 1, the median is 

more informative than the mean and therefore, we report the median of the Monte-Carlo 

simulation. 

Table A1: Cl-δ18O and noble gas signatures of the end members. For Cl–, δ18O, and 84Kr, which are 

used in the mixing calculations, the range of uncertainty is also given. These are based on the 

absolute uncertainty of the measurements for Cl– and δ18O and on the standard deviation of 84Kr 

concentrations of the glacial-meltwater-rich samples from Northern Estonia (Weissbach, 2014) for 

the glacial 84Kr.

The median and standard deviation of Kr proportions calculated from the mixing proportions and Kr 

concentrations of the end members (cf. Equation 7, Table A1) are also reported in Table 6. The 

calculated total Kr concentrations for each sample agree well with the measured Kr concentrations 

(Fig. A1) confirming the suitability of our mixing model for the noble gases. The R2-value in Fig. A1 

shows that 81% of the variation in noble gas concentrations can be explained by the three 

component mixing model (without samples 3 and 4 it is over 90%).
