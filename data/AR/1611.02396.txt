Mean pion multiplicities in Ar+Sc collisions∗

Michał Naskręt

University of Wroclaw, NA61/SHINE

Preliminary results for mean negatively charged pion multiplicities (cid:104)π−(cid:105)
using the h− method are presented for central Ar+Sc collisions at 13, 19,
30, 40, 75 and 150A GeV/c beam momentum. The data were recorded by
the NA61/SHINE detector at the CERN SPS. Starting with rapidity distri-
butions dn/dy the procedure of obtaining total multiplicities is presented.
The mean number of wounded nucleons (cid:104)W (cid:105) extracted from the Glissando
MC model is used to calculate the ratio (cid:104)π−(cid:105)/(cid:104)W (cid:105). The results are com-
pared to those from other experiments and their dependence on colliding
systems and collision energy is discussed.

PACS numbers: 25.75.-q, 25.75.Nq

1. Introduction

NA61/SHINE is a large acceptance ﬁxed target experiment which stud-
ies ﬁnal hadronic states in interactions between various particles and nu-
clei [1]. Pions are by far the most abundant particles produced in heavy ion
collisions. Using the h− method one can select negatively charged pions out
of all the produced particles [2].

Central Ar+Sc collision measurements are very important in the physics
programme of the NA61/SHINE experiment. Analysis of the data will help
understand the physics of the onset of deconﬁnement and the critical point.
Among the many diﬀerent hadrons produced in high energy collisions, pions
are the lightest and the most numerous. Thus, data on pion production
properties is crucial for constraining the basic properties of models of strong
interactions.

2. π− rapidity distributions

The starting point for the analysis described herein are the π− rapidity
distributions dn/dy for the 5 % most central collisions as shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1. π− Rapidity distributions with ﬁtted Gaussian functions for all measured
beam momenta. The red boxes are measured points, open boxes are measured
points reﬂected at midrapidity, dashed curves are ﬁtted Gaussians and the solid
curve is the sum of the ﬁtted Gaussians.

They were obtained by M. Lewicki using the so-called h− method wich is
described in a separate contribution. Centrality was determined by selecting
the 5 % of collisions with the smallest forward going energy as measured by
the projectile spectator detector.

Due to the wide acceptance of the NA61/SHINE experiment spectra
could be extrapolated reliably to 4π acceptance. The extrapolation process
consisted of two steps - extrapolation in transverse momentum pT for each
bin of rapidity y and extrapolation of dn/dy in rapidity. For the latter a
sum of two Gaussian functions was ﬁited, g(y) = gT(y) + gP(y), where

3. Mean multiplicities of π−

In order to calculate the mean negatively charged pion multiplicity (cid:104)π−(cid:105),

we utilized the following formula:

Thus the ﬁnal result is the sum over measured values of dn/dy in the
acceptance region and the integral over the Gaussian ﬁts outside. This
procedure gave the results presented in table 1. Statistical uncertainties
σstat((cid:104)π−(cid:105)) were obtained by propagating the statistical uncertainties of
spectra. Systematic uncertainties σsys((cid:104)π−(cid:105)) are assumed to be 5%

4. Obtaining the number of wounded nucleons (cid:104)W (cid:105)

The estimate of the mean number of wounded nucleons was performed
using two Monte Carlo models - Glissando 2.73 [3] and EPOS 1.99 (version
CRMC 1.5.3) [4]. Uncertainties of (cid:104)W (cid:105) were not calculated and will not
be presented. In both models event selection was based on the number of
projectile spectators: collisions with the 5% lowest number were chosen.

The diﬀerences between the resulting values of (cid:104)W (cid:105) are signiﬁcant, see
table 2. For lower momenta EPOS gives much smaller numbers than Glis-
sando.

In order to stay consistent with previously used values, the result from
the Glauber model based Glissando calculation (cid:104)W (cid:105)Glissando was chosen.
The resulting ratios of (cid:104)π−(cid:105)/(cid:104)W (cid:105) are presented in table 3.

5. (cid:104)π−(cid:105)/(cid:104)W (cid:105) and the ’kink’ plot

The preliminary results on (cid:104)π−(cid:105)/(cid:104)W (cid:105) from central Ar+Sc reactions are
plotted in Fig. 2 together with other measuremets of NA61/SHINE [5,
2], and data from NA49 [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and other experiments [11, 12,
13]. In order to compare results obtained for diﬀerent systems, an isospin
correction should be applied. To this end phenomenological formulas are
used: (cid:104)π−(cid:105)N+N = (cid:104)π−(cid:105)p+p + 1/3 and in the case of Au+Au the average
((cid:104)π−(cid:105)Au+Au + (cid:104)π+(cid:105)Au+Au)/2. This procedure is based on the compilation of
the world data and the model presented in [14]. The correction for nucleus-
nucleus collisions was only applied at 13A GeV where it is large. As seen
from Fig. 2 the (cid:104)π−(cid:105)/(cid:104)W (cid:105) ratio shows little dependence on the system size at
the lower energies while a rising tendency is observed at the highest energy.
The (cid:104)π(cid:105)/(cid:104)W (cid:105) ratio has often been plotted against the Fermi energy

As for NA61/SHINE there are results only for (cid:104)π−(cid:105) in Ar+Sc, Be+Be
and p+p collisions, the multiplicities of (cid:104)π+(cid:105) and (cid:104)π0(cid:105) were approximated
by (cid:104)π(cid:105)p+p = 3(cid:104)π−(cid:105)p+p + 1 and (cid:104)π(cid:105)Ar+Sc = 3(cid:104)π−(cid:105)Ar+Sc. Figure 3 shows a
compilation of world data compared to the NA61/SHINE measurements.
One observes that for high SPS energies Ar+Sc follows the Pb+Pb trend,
i.e. pion enhancement in central collisions of nuclei. On the other hand, for
low SPS energies Ar+Sc follows the results from p+p reactions.
