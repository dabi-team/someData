We present the ﬁrst next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic resummation for the two-jet rate in e+e−
annihilation in the Durham and Cambridge algorithms. The results are obtained by extending the
ARES method to observables involving any global, recursively infrared and collinear safe jet algorithm
in e+e−
collisions. As opposed to other methods, this approach does not require a factorization
theorem for the observables. We present predictions matched to next-to-next-to-leading order, and
a comparison to LEP data.

Jet rates and event shapes in electron-positron colli-
sions played a crucial role in establishing QCD as the the-
ory of strong interactions, see e.g. [1, 2]. Nowadays, these
observables are still among the most precise tools used for
accurate extractions of the main parameter of the theory,
the strong coupling constant αs. These ﬁts rely on com-
paring precise measurements of distributions to accurate
perturbative predictions supplemented with a modelling
of non-perturbative eﬀects. Fixed order predictions up
to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for e+e−
3
jets are available [3–7]. However, they are not reliable
in the two-jet limit, where the cross section is dominated
by multiple soft-collinear emissions. In this region, terms
s L2n) (where L = ln(1/v)) appear to all
as large as
orders in the integrated distributions of an observable v
that vanishes in the two-jet limit. These large logarithms
invalidate ﬁxed-order expansions in the coupling constant
and reliable predictions can only be obtained by resum-
ming the logarithmically enhanced terms to all orders in
s L2n) are known to
αs. Double logarithmic terms
exponentiate (see e.g. ref. [8]) and give rise to a well-
known Sudakov peak in diﬀerential distributions, where
most of the data lies. For exponentiating observables, it
is customary to deﬁne leading logarithms (LL) as terms
s Ln+1 for the logarithm of the cross section,
of the form αn

e+e− observables, NNLL predictions (in some cases even
beyond) are nowadays available [9–17]. On the contrary,
two-jet rates have been described only at NLL accuracy
so far [18]. The lack of precise theory predictions close
to the peak of the distribution limits the ﬁt range that
can be used to extract αs and results in larger pertur-
bative uncertainties in the latter. Among the existing
ﬁts, extractions from the thrust and C-parameter [19–
21] that rely on the most precise theory predictions show
a tension with the world average determination of the
coupling [22]. One of the issues is that at LEP energies
non-perturbative corrections are sizeable, and the sep-
aration between perturbative and non-perturbative ef-
fects is subtle. Fits of αs from the two-jet rate have
been so far performed based on pure NNLO [23], or

(αn

O

NNLO+NLL [24–26] results. Owing to the diﬀerent sen-
sitivity to non-perturbative eﬀects, an extraction of αs
from NNLO+NNLL predictions for the two-jet rate and
from the vast amount of high-precision LEP data [27–31]
can shed light on this disturbing tension. The aim of this
letter is to present the ﬁrst NNLL+NNLO results for this
observable.

The two-jet rate is deﬁned through a clustering algo-
rithm based on an ordering vij and a test variable yij. In
the Durham algorithm [8] the two variables coincide

where θij is the angle between (pseudo-)particles i and j,

center-of-mass energy. The clustering procedure selects
the pair with the smallest y(D)
. If the latter is smaller
ij
than a given ycut, the two particles are recombined into a
pseudo-particle according to some recombination scheme.
Otherwise, the clustering sequence stops, and the number
of jets is deﬁned as the number of pseudo-particles left. In
the Cambridge algorithm [32, 33], the test and ordering
variables diﬀer, and are deﬁned by

the two particles are recombined into a pseudo-particle,
otherwise the softer particle becomes a jet. This is
commonly referred to as the soft freezing mechanism.
The procedure stops when no pseudo-particles are left.
The angular-ordered (AO) version of the Durham algo-
rithm [32] works identically to the Cambridge algorithm,
but without the freezing mechanism. The three-jet reso-
lution parameter y3 is deﬁned as the minimum ycut that
produces two jets. The two-jet rate is the cumulative in-
tegral of the y3 distribution, normalized to the total cross

The resummation technique formulated in ref. [14] for
event shapes does not require the factorization of the
singular soft and collinear modes in the observable’s def-
inition, but it rather relies on a property known as re-
cursive infrared and collinear (rIRC) safety [34]. In this
sense, the all-order treatment does not require a factor-
ization theorem for the observable.1 In the following, we
present an extension of the above method to jet observ-
ables and apply it to the two-jet rate in the Durham and
Cambridge algorithm.

The NNLL corrections are obtained by correcting a single
parton of the above ensemble to account for all kinematic
conﬁgurations that give rise to NNLL eﬀects [14]. The

it is universal for all observables featuring the same scal-

Fclust. The remaining algorithms are obtained following

the same strategy of taking the asymptotic limit in the
region considered in each correction. They are reported
in ref. [35] both for the Durham and for the Cambridge.
We will ﬁrst discuss the case of the Durham algorithm,
and we will eventually obtain the Cambridge result as a
trivial case of the discussion that follows.2

We start by recalling the calculation of

FNLL, which
is determined by an ensemble of soft-collinear, strongly
angular-ordered partons emitted independently oﬀ the
Born legs. For soft emissions, recoil eﬀects are negligi-
ble and all transverse momenta can be computed with
respect to the emitting quark-antiquark pair. For each
emission ki we deﬁne the rapidity fraction with respect
to the emitting leg ℓi as ξ(ℓi)
/ ln(1/√ycut), where
i =

ηi|

1 Note that a factorization theorem for the Cambridge algorithm

is straightforward.

2 We note that the NNLL results presented in this letter are valid
for all commonly used recombination schemes in e+e− collisions
(schemes E, E0, P , P0, cf. ref. [8] for their deﬁnition), while
their NNLO counterpart depends on the recombination scheme.

ln(1/√ycut) is the NLL rapidity bound, common to all
emissions at this order. For this ensemble, the Durham
algorithm is approximated by the following simpliﬁed
version, ysc

to step 1.

Because of the assumption of strong rapidity ordering
between the emissions, this algorithm ensures that
FNLL
is free from subleading eﬀects. We point out that as
long as emissions are strongly ordered in rapidity, the
clustering history only depends on the rapidity ordering
among emissions, and not on the actual rapidities.

The above algorithm is used whenever emissions are
soft-collinear and widely separated in angle, even be-
yond NLL order. In particular it can be used to compute
the NNLL soft-collinear correction δ
Fsc. This function is
made of two contributions with diﬀerent physical origins:

be non-zero only if the rapidity of emission k is, in mag-
nitude, the largest of all. The rapidity correction is then
computed by using the strongly-ordered algorithm de-
ﬁned above, with emission k ﬁxed to be the most for-
ward/backward of all [35]. Note that this issue is irrele-
vant for event shapes since they are independent of the
rapidity fractions, and that the derivation of the rapidity
correction given here can be equally applied in that case.

for the jet-veto resummation in ref. [36], and is reported
in [35].

the NNLL logarithmic structure is much simpler.
In
this case the ordering variable (2) only depends on the
angular distance between emissions. Since at NLL all
partons are well separated in rapidity, there will be no
clustering between the emissions, and each of them will
be recombined with one of the Born legs in an angular-
ordered way. One therefore obtains the trivial result
FNLL(λ) = 1. The same arguments imply that the NNLL
corrections δ
Fhc = 0 [35]. Moreover, both the re-
coil and the wide-angle corrections admit a simple ana-
lytic form given that the emission emitted either at wide
angles or collinearly will never cluster with any of the
other soft-collinear emissions. As a consequence the con-
tribution from this emission factorizes with respect to
the remaining ensemble [35]. The same property applies
to the clustering and correlated corrections which can be
entirely formulated in terms of the clustering condition
between two soft-collinear emissions [35], analogously to

We illustrate the impact of our calculation by matching
the NNLL two-jet rate (4) to the
s) result obtained
with the program EERAD3 [40] for both the Durham
and the Cambridge algorithms. Figure 1 shows the
matched diﬀerential distributions for the three-jet res-
olution parameter, deﬁned in (3), at NNLL+NNLO and
NLL+NNLO. The results are obtained at Q = MZ, using
the coupling αs(MZ) = 0.118, and the E recombination
scheme. To impose unitarity, following ref. [14], we em-
ploy the modiﬁed logarithms

in such a way that the xy dependence is N3LL. This also
ensures that the distribution vanishes at the kinematical
endpoint y3,max, taken from the NNLO result. Further-
more, the variation of xy probes the size of subleading
logarithmic eﬀects. Our theoretical uncertainties are ob-
tained by varying, one at the time, xy and the renor-
malization scale µR by a factor of two in either direction
around the central values xy = 1 and µR = Q, and taking
the envelope of these variations.

For the Durham algorithm, as expected, we observe a
signiﬁcant reduction of the theory error when going from
NLL to NNLL. On the contrary, for the Cambridge algo-
rithm, NNLL corrections are quite large, and the NNLL
uncertainty is larger than the NLL one, which in turn
seems to be underestimated. This eﬀect can be under-
stood by observing that the NLL prediction for the Cam-
bridge algorithm does not contain any information about

multiple emissions eﬀects since no clustering occurs at
FNLL = 1. These eﬀects appear only at
this order and
NNLL, explaining the sizable numerical corrections. It
follows that the NLL theory uncertainty as estimated in
ﬁgure 1 is unable to capture large subleading eﬀects. A
similar phenomenon was already observed in the resum-
mation for the jet-veto eﬃciency [36].

To conclude, in ﬁgure 2 we compare our NNLL+NNLO
prediction to the data taken by the L3 collaboration at
LEP2 [30] at Q = 206 GeV. At this high center-of-mass
energy the impact of hadronization eﬀects, which are not
included in our calculation, is moderate. Overall, we ﬁnd
good agreement with data down to the lowest values of
ycut. Owing to the small residual perturbative uncertain-
ties, our calculation shows promise for a precise determi-
nation of the strong coupling using e+e− data measured
at LEP.

In this paper we have presented a general method for
ﬁnal-state resummation at NNLL order for global rIRC
safe observables that vanish in the two-jet limit, where
a single family of large logarithms is resummed. We de-
rived explicit results for the two-jet rate in e+e−. The
computer code ARES used to obtain the results presented
here can be made available upon request to the authors.

Next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic real corrections

Resolved real corrections at NLL

At NLL accuracy the details of the resolved real radiation are described by the multiple emission function

FNLL.
FNLL is deﬁned on an ensemble of independently-emitted soft and collinear partons, widely separated in rapidity.
< ln(1/√ycut). The multiple emission function depends on

Soft-collinear correction

8

The soft-collinear NNLL correction takes into account the correct rapidity bound for one of the soft-collinear
emissions that give rise to the NLL multiple emission function, as well as NNLL contributions arising from the
running of the QCD coupling in the soft-collinear matrix elements. We denote by k the emission for which we account
for either eﬀect, and introduce ζ such that ysc
t /Q2 = ζycut. If y3 were an event shape, we could integrate
3 (
{
inclusively over the rapidity fraction of each emission. As a result, the emission probability for k, collinear to the
Born leg ℓ, would be proportional to the function R′ℓ (ζycut) deﬁned in Section 2 of ref. [14]. In this case both NNLL
eﬀects could be accounted for by expanding R′ℓ (ζycut) as follows:

, k) = k2

R′ℓ (ζycut)

R′NLL,ℓ(ycut) + δR′NNLL,ℓ(ycut) + R′′ℓ (ycut) ln

.

(12)

The full expressions for δR′NNLL,ℓ(ycut) and R′′ℓ (ycut) are given in ref. [14]. In the present case, this correction must be
formulated in a slightly more general way than the corresponding one deﬁned for event-shape observables [14]. The
NNLL term proportional to δR′NNLL,ℓ(ycut) in eq. (12) contains the contribution from the one-loop cusp anomalous
dimension as well as from the two-loop running of the QCD coupling. In this term, the rapidity of all emissions is
bounded by the NLL limit ln(1/√ycut). Therefore this correction is unchanged with respect to event shapes, and
gives rise to

The term proportional to ln(1/ζ) is purely NNLL. Therefore, when integrating over the emissions’ phase space, we can
set all rapidity bounds to the NLL limit ln(1/√ycut), neglecting subleading logarithmic terms. This approximation is
identical to the one deﬁning eq. (13), therefore the two corrections can be put together to deﬁne the running-coupling

The second term in eq. (14) is associated with the correct rapidity bound for emission k. Given that the observable
in this case depends on the rapidity fractions of the emissions, unlike for event shapes the latter correction is not
accounted for by eq. (12).

To study how the form of this correction is modiﬁed, let us consider a given ensemble of n emissions k1, . . . , kn
strongly ordered in rapidity, collinear to the same hard leg, say ℓ = 1 which corresponds to positive rapidities. All

9

˜p
}

of the emissions have the NLL rapidity bound ln(1/√ycut) except for the emission kj which has the exact rapidity
bound ln(Q/ktj) > ln(1/√ycut). The latter relation can be proven by observing that for all emissions ki one has that
√ycutQ. This statement is trivial if no clustering occurs. If pseudo-particles kI and kJ are recombined, the
kti ≤
will be larger than ktI and ktJ . This is because a clustering
transverse momentum of the resulting jet
occurs only if ~ktI ·
~ktJ > 0 in the NLL algorithm. By induction, in all conﬁgurations which end up with two jets (i.e.
ysc
3 (

Let us consider a given ordering of transverse momenta

of the n emissions. For such a conﬁguration of
transverse momenta, n! rapidity orderings are available. Each rapidity ordering corresponds to a diﬀerent value for
the observable in its NLL version (see the algorithm given in the previous section). We now assume that all emissions
but kj have the NLL rapidity bound ln(1/√ycut), whereas ηj < ln(Q/ktj). Without loss of generality, we start by

We stress that this result is the same regardless of the rapidity bound of emissions k2,

in eq. (18) is correct under the assumption of strong rapidity ordering. The extra NNLL correction originating
from conﬁgurations in which two emissions are close in rapidity, for which the NLL version of the observable cannot
be applied, is taken into account in the clustering corrections derived below. It is manifest that the integral (18)
contributes to a given kinematic conﬁguration starting at NLL. To neglect subleading eﬀects, we can expand the
strong coupling in eq. (18) as in eq. (15). This leads to

The bound in η2 can be replaced with ln(1/√ycut) since the region where η2 > ln(1/√ycut) gives rise to a subleading
correction. Moreover, the argument of the running coupling can be replaced with √ycutQ for all emissions at NNLL.

Eq. (22) gives a pure NNLL contribution, and it is obtained in the limit of strong rapidity ordering. The conﬁguration
in which two emissions are close in rapidity here gives a subleading correction, proving that there is no overlap with
the conﬁgurations contributing to the clustering correction.

In eq. (19) we can recognise the NLL contribution (ﬁrst term in the r.h.s.) that gives rise to the function

FNLL,
and the NNLL correction proportional to λR′′ℓ in eq. (16), that starts at
s). Eq. (22) gives rise to a pure NNLL
correction which accounts for the exact rapidity bound for a single emission. At NNLL accuracy, this bound matters
only for the most forward/backward emission. We denote this correction by δ

Clustering corrections

This correction describes an ensemble of soft-collinear partons emitted oﬀ the Born legs of which at most two
are close in rapidity and the remaining ones are strongly separated in angle. For rIRC safe observables, this kine-
matical conﬁguration contributes only at NNLL order and beyond. The clustering correction δ

Similarly, the recoil correction implements the eﬀect of the hard-collinear emission on the observable by taking
into account the exact recoil kinematics in this regime.
In fact, for a hard-collinear parton k, the approximation

momenta with respect to the thrust axis of the event. In the above conﬁguration, we have to distinguish between the
transverse momentum kt of k with respect to the ﬁnal thrust axis and its transverse momentum k′t with respect to
the emitter prior to the hard-collinear emission, as discussed in ref. [14]. In turn this will give the correct transverse
momentum of the collinear emission with respect to the ﬁnal direction of the emitter, which enters the deﬁnition of
y3. Denoting by z the momentum fraction carried away from the emitter by the hard collinear parton k emitted oﬀ
the Born leg ˜pℓ, we have [14]

Durham algorithm: since, by deﬁnition, the wide-angle emission has the smallest rapidity fraction amongst
all emissions, if it recombines with any of the other collinear partons, it will be pulled at larger rapidity fractions
(see step 3 of the NLL algorithm). Therefore, the result of the recombination will be the same as if k were soft

and collinear. It follows that the soft-wide angle contribution is non-zero only if k does not cluster with any of
the soft-collinear emissions. For this emission, the expression of y3 becomes
