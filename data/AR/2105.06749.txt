The many-body-theory approach to positronium-atom interactions developed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 183402
(2018)] is applied to the sequence of noble-gas atoms He–Xe. The Dyson equation is solved separately for an
electron and positron moving in the ﬁeld of the atom, with the entire system enclosed in a hard-wall spherical
cavity. The two-particle Dyson equation is solved to give the energies and wave functions of the Ps eigenstates
in the cavity. From these, we determine the scattering phase shifts and cross sections, and values of the pickoﬀ
annihilation parameter 1𝑍eﬀ including short-range electron-positron correlations via vertex enhancement factors.
Comparisons are made with available experimental data for elastic and momentum-transfer cross sections and
1𝑍eﬀ. Values of 1𝑍eﬀ for He and Ne, previously reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 183402 (2018)], are found to
be in near-perfect agreement with experiment, and for Ar, Kr, and Xe within a factor of 1.2.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Positronium (Ps) is the bound state of an electron and
positron. Being a purely leptonic system, and the simplest
“anti-atom", Ps interactions with matter are of fundamental
interest and have applications in many areas [1]. For exam-
ple, the AEgIS and GBAR experiments at CERN [2, 3] aim
to test whether gravity aﬀects antimatter equivalently to mat-
ter, making antihydrogen in Ps collisions with antiprotons,
with Ps produced in a mesoporous material [4]. Ps is widely
used in condensed-matter physics to determine pore sizes in
nanoporous materials and to probe intermolecular voids in
polymers [5]. Moreover, Ps formation in porous materials
is used to study its interactions with gases, e.g., Xe [6, 7],
or the interaction between the Ps atoms themselves [8–11],
with prospects of room-temperature Bose-Einstein condensa-
tion and an annihilation gamma laser [12–14]. There are also
proposals for using a beam of long-lived Rydberg Ps for mea-
suring the free fall of a matter-antimatter system [15] and for
detecting positron-atom bound states [16].

The theoretical description of Ps-atom interactions is chal-
lenging due to the composite nature of both scattering objects
and a signiﬁcant cancellation between the short-range Ps-atom
repulsion (which results from the exchange interaction between
the electrons in the target atom and the electron in Ps) and
the long-range van der Waals attraction. Accurate calculations
must account for virtual excitation of both objects during the
collision.

In this work we carry out calculations of Ps scattering by
noble-gas atoms at low energies (i.e., below the Ps ionization
potential, 6.8 eV). The authors have previously considered this
problem in the frozen-target approximation, where virtual ex-
citations of the target atom are neglected, and also using a
model van der Waals potential to approximately account for
such excitations [17]. The calculated scattering cross sections
did not agree with the experimental data for Ar and Xe, which

∗ a.swann@qub.ac.uk
† d.green@qub.ac.uk
‡ g.gribakin@qub.ac.uk

indicated that the cross section becomes very small at low Ps
energies, suggesting that a Ramsaeur-Townsend minimum may
be present [18]. In a subsequent publication, we developed a
many-body theory description of Ps-atom interactions by com-
bining the many-body theory description of electron-atom and
positron-atom interactions, while including the important ef-
fect of screening of the electron-positron Coulomb interaction
by the atom [19]. As ﬁrst applications, we computed scatter-
ing cross sections and pickoﬀ annihilation rates 1𝑍eﬀ for Ps
collisions with He and Ne [19]. The cross section for both
targets was found to be an overall rather featureless curve gen-
tly decreasing with higher momenta, with no appearance of
a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum. The scattering lengths were
found to be positive (1.70 a.u. for He and 1.76 a.u. for Ne), in-
dicating that the Ps-atom interaction is overall repulsive at low
energy. The calculations of 1𝑍eﬀ were the ﬁrst to account for
short-range electron-positron correlations, which are known to
enhance annihilation rates by a factor of 2–5 [20, 21]. Including
the short-range enhancement gave agreement with experimen-
tal measurements of 1𝑍eﬀ for He and Ne at room tempera-
ture [22] at the level of 5–10% accuracy. Here we describe the
many-body-theory approach in more detail and extend its ap-
plication to Ar, Kr and Xe, including a study of the sensitivity
of the results on the energies at which the screened Coulomb
interaction is calculated.

Unless otherwise stated, atomic units (a.u.) are used
throughout, with the symbol 𝑎0 denoting the Bohr radius (the
atomic unit of length).

II. THEORY

A. Hard-wall conﬁnement

The system under consideration is a ground-state Ps atom
moving in the ﬁeld of a closed-shell many-electron atom. We
enclose the entire system by an impenetrable spherical wall
of radius 𝑅𝑐 centered on the target atom. This has the eﬀect
of making all Ps states discrete [23]. This hard-wall cavity
is a key feature of our method. Values of 𝑅𝑐 are chosen in
such a way that the cavity does not aﬀect the atomic ground
state and allows for an accurate description of the distortion

 
 
 
 
 
 
of Ps as it scatters on the target atom. This enables us to
determine Ps-atom scattering phase shifts from the discrete
energy eigenvalues [17].

We construct the Ps wavefunction as an expansion of elec-
tron and positron states that are solutions of the Dyson equa-
tion, which involves the self-energy for the respective particle
in the ﬁeld of the atom. The Ps state satisﬁes a two-particle
Dyson equation (Bethe-Salpeter equation), which we solve to
ﬁnd the expansion coeﬃcients and discrete energy eigenvalues
from which the scattering phase shifts can be determined [17].
We now describe each step in detail.

𝜓𝐸 = 𝐸𝜓𝐸 .

A conventional treatment of an electron or positron interac-
tion with an 𝑁-electron atom would start from the Schrödinger
equation for the total wave function for the 𝑁
1 particles. In
many-body theory we instead start from the Dyson equation
(see, e.g., Refs. [24, 25]):
𝐻0 +

)
Here, 𝜓𝐸 is the single-particle (quasiparticle) wave function
of the incident electron or positron, 𝐸 is its energy, and 𝐻0
is a central-ﬁeld Hamiltonian that describes the motion of the
incident electron or positron in the static ﬁeld of the atom (in-
cluding exchange for the electron). The key quantity in Eq. (1)
is Σ𝐸 , a nonlocal, energy-dependent correlation potential that
is equal to the self-energy part of the single-particle Green’s
function of the electron or positron in the ﬁeld of the atom [26].
Due to its nonlocal, dynamical nature, Σ𝐸 operates on 𝜓𝐸 as
an integral operator:

∫

The self-energy Σ𝐸 is given by an inﬁnite series in pow-
ers of the residual electron-electron and/or electron-positron
interactions. The use of the Hartree-Fock approximation for
the atomic electrons and inclusion of the electrostatic (and
exchange) interaction in 𝐻0 means that the expansion for Σ𝐸
starts with the second-order diagrams, and the diagrams do
not contain elements that describe the electrostatic potential
of the atom [27]. For electrons, this also implies the absence
from Σ𝐸 of the contribution of the target exchange potential.
As a result of the spherical symmetry of the problem, Eq. (1)
can be solved separately for each partial wave of the incident
electron or positron. The self-energy is expanded in partial
waves as

Eq. (15) for each partial wave yields the Dyson-orbital energies
and corresponding expansion coeﬃcients for the quasiparticle
wave functions. For the electron, the result is a set of negative-
energy states corresponding to the atomic orbitals, along with
a set of positive-energy “contimuum” states. For the positron,
all of the states are positive-energy “continuum” states.

E. Energy dependence of the self-energy

Because of the dynamic nature of the electron- or positron-
atom correlation potential, the self-energy is energy depen-
dent: the energy 𝐸 appears in the energy denominators of the
Goldstone diagrams [see, e.g., Eq. (7)]. However, in ﬁnding
the Dyson orbitals we do not know the value of 𝐸 until we have
𝜀
solved Eq. (16), which requires the matrix elements
(cid:105)
to already have been calculated. This problem could be circum-
vented by solving the Dyson equation self-consistently with
𝜀
some initial guess for the energy 𝐸 being used in
(cid:105)
(e.g., the corresponding Hartree-Fock energy). However, there
are at least two diﬃculties associated with such an approach:

𝜀(cid:48)|

𝜀(cid:48)|

Σ𝐸

Σ𝐸

(cid:104)

(cid:104)

|

|

1. For any given partial wave of the incident electron or
positron, the self-consistent solution of the Dyson equa-
tion would have to be carried out separately for each
radial state, i.e., when solving Eq. (16) only the energy
and expansion coeﬃcients for the state under considera-
tion are accurate; the energies and expansion coeﬃcients
that arise for the other states must be ignored.

2. If each of the Dyson orbitals is calculated with its
𝜀(cid:48)|
then they will not
own self-energy matrix
be mutually orthogonal. Hence they will not be suitable
for constructing the two-particle Ps wave function (see
Sec. II F).

Σ𝐸

𝜀

(cid:105)

(cid:104)

In light of this, we have chosen to consistently calculate all of
the self-energy diagrams at 𝐸 = 0. The energy dependence of
the self-energy matrix elements
is rather weak in
the energy range of interest and provides a good description of
electron and positron interactions with noble-gas atoms [19].
In Sec. IV C we will brieﬂy investigate the eﬀect of changing
the value of 𝐸 on the results.

𝑉 is the attractive
the self-energy of the electron (positron),
−
Coulomb interaction between the electron and positron in Ps,
and Ψ is the two-particle Ps wave function with energy 𝐸 [35].
The operator 𝛿𝑉𝐸 is the screening correction to the electron-
positron Coulomb interaction. The diagrams for the matrix
elements
are shown in Fig. 3; again, we
(cid:105)
calculate diagrams up to second order. The direct screening
diagram (the second diagram in Fig. 3) is essential for cancel-
ing the long range 𝑟 −
4 behavior of the single-particle electron
and positron polarization diagrams and making the long-range
Ps-atom interaction of the required 𝑅−
6 van der Waals form,
where 𝑅 is the distance between the nucleus of the target atom
and the Ps center of mass. The exchange screening diagrams
(the third, fourth, and ﬁfth diagrams in Fig. 3) are more ex-
pensive to calculate than the direct diagram, but they partially
cancel each other are almost negligible in comparison (see
Sec. IV A and Fig. 7); consequently, we will not include the
exchange screening diagrams in our calculations.

From this point forward, we shall, without exception, use
the label 𝜇 to refer to electron states in the ﬁeld of the atom,
and we shall use the label 𝜈 to refer to positron states in the
ﬁeld of the atom. Since the electron and positron Dyson or-
bitals 𝜓𝜇
are eigenstates of the single-particle
Dyson equations (1), they form mutually orthonormal sets.
From them, a two-particle Ps wave function with ﬁxed total

F. Two-particle Ps states

Having determined the Dyson-orbital energies and wave

Ps moving in the ﬁeld of the target atom is

The factor of 1

tribute to pickoﬀ annihilation (assuming that all annihilation

)

Our interest is in values of 1𝑍eﬀ at small (thermal) Ps ener-
gies, where only the 𝑆 wave contributes. Higher contributions
are suppressed as 𝐾 2𝐿, where 𝐾 is the Ps momentum and 𝐿 is
the orbital angular momentum of the Ps center-of-mass motion.
We therefore use Ψ = Ψ0+ (with appropriate normalization) in
Eq. (21).

To account for the short-range-correlation corrections to
1𝑍eﬀ (neglected in the independent-particle approximation),
we augment Eq. (21) with vertex enhancement factors 𝛾𝑛𝑙,
which are speciﬁc to the electron orbital 𝑛 and positron partial
wave 𝑙, and were calculated for positron annihilation in noble-
gas atoms in Refs. [20, 21]. Explicitly, substituting Eq. (18) into
Eq. (21), using orthonormality of the electron wave functions,
and introducing the enhancement factors yields

where the positron states 𝜓𝜈 and 𝜓𝜈
(cid:48) both have angular momen-
tum 𝑙 (see Appendix A for details of how 1𝑍eﬀ is computed in
practice). The enhancement factors are largest for the valence
electrons but may still be signiﬁcant for the core electrons [37].
Also, the values of 𝛾𝑛𝑙 are dependent on the energy of the in-
cident positron, though this dependence is not very strong (see
Fig. 13 in Ref. [27]). Here we use values of 𝛾𝑛𝑙 at zero energy
of the positron. Note that the 𝛾𝑛𝑙 can be calculated using either
Hartree-Fock or Dyson states for the positron. Here we use the
Hartree-Fock values, because when the positron is “packaged”
within Ps, it is shielded from the target atom by its partner elec-
tron. The two particles together cannot polarize the atom as
much as a lone positron could, and virtual Ps contributes lit-
tle because the positron already has a partner electron. Table I

A. B-spline bases

First, a standard Hartree-Fock program [38] is used to com-
pute the electrostatic potential of the ground-state target atom.
Then, a 𝐵-spline basis is used to calculate the single-particle
electron and positron Hartree-Fock wave functions 𝜑 𝜀𝑙𝑚 (see,
e.g., Ref. [27]). We do this for both the electron and positron
using two diﬀerent sets of 𝐵 splines: the ﬁrst set contains 40
splines of order 6, deﬁned in a cavity of radius 𝑅𝑐 = 30 a.u.,
using an exponential knot sequence (see Eq. (31) in Ref. [27]);
the second set contains 60 splines of order 9, deﬁned in a
cavity of radius 𝑅𝑐 = 10, 12, 14, or 16 a.u., using a quadratic-
linear knot sequence (see Eq. (28) in Ref. [17]). The reason for
using two distinct sets of 𝐵 splines is as follows. Calculation

electron and positron self-energies requires summation over a
complete set of intermediate states. The exponential knot se-
quence is well-suited to this, since it provides rapid saturation
of the electron and positron continua (see Fig. 6 in Ref. [27]).
However, we ultimately want to use the electron and positron
states to construct a two-particle Ps wave function; for this we
need the single-particle states to accurately represent “phys-
ical” states in the cavity, for which the quadratic-linear knot
sequence is well suited [17]. The two sets of Hartree-Fock
states for both the electron and positron are used to ﬁnd the
Dyson orbitals in the following manner:

the Dyson-orbital energies of the electron or positron in

This method enables the exponential-sequence Hartree-Fock
wave functions to be used in the sums over intermediate states
of diagrams, thus ensuring completeness, while the Dyson-
orbital energies and wave functions are ultimately calculated
using the quadratic-linear sequence, meaning that they can
be used to accurately calculate Ps states in the cavity and
determine Ps-atom scattering phase shifts.

Note that when we construct the two-particle Ps wave
function from the single-particle electron and positron states
[Eq. (18)], we only use the Dyson-orbital states for the ﬁrst
few partial waves, speciﬁcally, 𝑙 = 0–3. To solve the Dyson
equation for all angular momenta of the incident electron or
positron included in the expansion of the Ps wave function (up
to 𝑙 = 20; see Sec. III C) is computationally expensive and

6

unnecessary. For higher 𝑙, the centrifugal barrier prevents the
electron or positron from approaching the target atom closely,
and the eﬀect of correlations (i.e., Σ𝐸 ) is small. Hence, we just
use the Hartree-Fock states for 𝑙

(
In practice, we calculate the self-energy diagrams for 𝑙max =
7, 8, 9, and 10, diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix for each
value of 𝑙max, and extrapolate the resulting eigenenergies using
the values for 𝑙max = 9 and 10 to ﬁnd the parameters 𝐸 and
𝐴 in Eq. (24). We use 32 radial states for each angular mo-
mentum in all calculations of second-order diagrams. We ﬁnd
that extrapolation typically changes the 𝑙max = 10 value of the

C. Convergence with respect to number of electron and

In Eq. (18), the sums over the electron and positron states
should, in theory, run over all orbital angular momenta and
radial quantum numbers (up to inﬁnity), but in practice we use
ﬁnite maximum values 𝑙max and 𝑛max, respectively [43]. The

D. Normalization of Ps wave function in calculation of 1𝑍eﬀ

In Eq. (22), the Ps wave function needs to be such that
the center-of-mass motion is normalized to a plane wave at
large distances; however, in our calculations in the cavity, it is
normalized as

Assuming that the Ps wave function can be factorized into
internal and center-of-mass parts (see Eq. (11) in Ref. [17]),
which are themselves normalized to unity in the cavity, the
normalization of the center-of-mass motion can be corrected
as follows:

1. The center-of-mass density 𝜌cm(

center of mass from the center of the cavity. We calculate
the value of 𝜌cm on a grid from 0 to 𝑅𝑐, using integer
and half-integer values of 𝑟. See Appendix A for details

This extrapolation typically changes the value of 𝜌cm

principle one can also extrapolate in 𝑛max; however, it
was found that doing so changes the value of 𝜌cm by less
than 0.5%, so it can be neglected.

3. In the asymptotic region of the cavity, i.e., the region
where the Ps center of mass is not too close to either the

where 𝐵 is a normalization constant, 𝐾 is the Ps center-

phase shift. The value of 𝐵 is determined by performing
a least-squares ﬁt of Eq. (31) to the calculated values
of 𝜌cm, with 𝐵 as a parameter. The phase shift 𝛿0 can
be taken from the scattering calculation or allowed to
be a second parameter of the ﬁt. We generally ﬁnd that
allowing 𝛿0 to be a variable parameter gives a slightly
better ﬁt to the calculated values of 𝜌cm, so we allow
this in all calculations [45]. Figure 4 shows the center-
of-mass density for the lowest-energy Ps eigenstate in
collisions with Ar, in a cavity of radius 𝑅𝑐 = 10 a.u.,
in the frozen-target approximation [where we excluded
Σ𝐸 for both the electron and positron and 𝛿𝑉𝐸 from
Eq. (17)].

𝐵2 to obtain correctly normalized values.

IV. RESULTS

We have previously reported the scattering cross sections
and values of 1𝑍eﬀ for He and Ne in Ref. [19]; however, we
include them again here for ease of comparison with the current
results for Ar, Kr and Xe.

Figure 5 shows the 𝑆-, 𝑃-, and 𝐷-wave scattering phase
shifts 𝛿𝐿 obtained for Ps collisions with He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and
Xe. The phase shifts are calculated at discrete values of the
Ps center-of-mass momentum 𝐾, and eﬀective-range theory
is used to determine the general dependence of 𝛿𝐿 on 𝐾; see
Appendix B for details. In spite of the large diﬀerences in the
sizes and polarizabilities of the atoms, there is a great degree
of similarity between the phase shifts for all of them. This is
a result of cancellation of the eﬀect of increasing repulsion in
the He to Xe sequence (due to increasing atomic sizes) and
increasing strength of the correlation (van der Waals–type)
attraction between the Ps and the atom. Note that the 𝑆-wave
phase shift is negative at low 𝐾 for all ﬁve target atoms, i.e.,
the scattering length is positive for all of them. Therefore, we
can immediately deduce that a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum
will not appear in any of our cross sections, in contrast to the
experimental prediction [18].

Table II shows the scattering lengths and zero-energy cross
sections, along data from a number of previous calculations:
the frozen-target calculations and model van der Waals cal-
culations of Swann and Gribakin [17]; the coupled-channel
𝑅-matrix calculation for He (which included 9 Ps states and
9 He states in the channel space) of Walters et al. [47]; ﬁxed-
core stochastic-variational calculations for Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe
(which included model polarization potentials for the electron
and positron, along with a two-body polarization potential
to ensure the correct long-range van der Waals behavior) of
Mitroy and coworkers [48, 49]; and the calculations of Fab-
rikant and coworkers where the electron- and positron-atom
interactions were modeled using pseudopotentials, along with
a model long-range van der Waals potential [50, 51]. For Ps
scattering on He, we obtain a scattering length of 1.70 a.u.,
which is close to our previous calculation [17] that mimicked
distortion of the target atom using a model van der Waals po-
tential (with 𝑅0 = 3.0 a.u.; see Eq. (24) in Ref. [17]) and the
9-Ps–9-He–state 𝑅-matrix calculation of Walters et al. [47]
at the level of 6%. This corresponds to a zero-energy cross
section of 11.6𝜋𝑎2
0. Note that the scattering length has reduced
from its frozen-target value [17] by 9%, and the zero-energy
cross section has reduced by 16%. The scattering lengths for
Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe are 1.76 a.u., 1.98 a.u., 2.06 a.u., and
2.12 a.u., respectively. The reduction of the scattering length
from its frozen-target value [17] increases with the nuclear
charge of the target, from 13% for Ne to 41% for Xe. In-
deed, the zero-energy cross section for Xe is approximately
one third of its frozen-target value. These results show that
the van der Waals–type interaction due to simultaneous dis-
tortion of the Ps and the target plays a very signiﬁcant role
in Ps-atom scattering and must be accounted for in order to
obtain accurate results. Its eﬀect is greater for heavier, more
polarizable atoms. Among other predictions, our calculations
are closest to the stochastic-variational results of Mitroy and
coworkers [48, 49].

Figure 6 shows the elastic scattering cross sections as func-
tions of the Ps center-of-mass momentum 𝐾, up to 𝐾 = 1 a.u.
(the Ps breakup threshold). They are generally rather ﬂat and

previous van der Waals calculations [17] at high Ps momenta.
The cross section for He is also in good agreement with the
9-Ps–9-He–state calculation of Walters et al. [47], with only a
10% discrepancy near 𝐾 = 0.

As we move along the noble gases in order of increasing
nuclear charge, the behavior of the cross section at low energy
goes from being decreasing for He, Ne, and Ar to almost ﬂat
for Kr, and to gently increasing for Xe. This is caused by the
increasing contribution of 𝑃-wave scattering at intermediate
momenta. Also, the valence electrons are less strongly bound
for heavier target atoms (heavier target atoms have lower ion-
ization potentials), so at low Ps energies, virtual excitations of
Ps and the valence atomic electrons make for stronger attrac-
tion than for lighter target atoms.

The level of agreement with the available experimental data
for Ar and Xe [18] is mixed. The contribution of the 𝐷 wave
remains small for all atoms. For Xe there is close agreement
for 0.6 (cid:46) 𝐾 (cid:46) 0.8 a.u. However, the experimental datum for

𝐾 = 0.44 a.u. is about a factor of 2 lower than our theoretical
prediction, and the two experimental data with the highest

to our calculation. The 𝑛 = 2 excitation threshold for Ps lies at
𝐾 = √3

inelastic scattering with excitation of Ps(𝑛 = 2) states, which is

The eﬀect of including or excluding the exchange screening
diagrams (see Fig. 3) on the scattering cross section has been
investigated for Ar. Figure 7 shows the total cross section for
Ar in three diﬀerent approximations: including only the di-
rect screening diagram, including the direct and exchange dia-
grams, and including neither the direct nor exchange screening

diagrams (i.e., treating the interaction between the electron and
positron as just the bare Coulomb interaction). Also shown is
the previous van der Waals calculation with 𝑅0 = 3.0 a.u. [17].
It is evident that including only the direct screening diagram
or including the direct and exchange screening diagrams gives
very a similar cross section, diﬀering by no more than 2%
across the momentum range considered. It is therefore justi-
ﬁed to exclude the exchange screening diagrams, on account

and the many-body-theory and van der Waals calculations co-
alesce at high 𝐾. Also shown in Fig. 8 are the experimental
data from several groups, which are not direct measurements
but the results extracted from observation of Ps thermalization
in the noble gases.

For He, our calculation lies within the error bars of the ex-
perimental result of Nagashima et al. [56] but is about 30–45%
higher than the earlier measurements of Canter et al. [52], Ryt-
sola et al. [53], and Coleman et al. [54]. The measurements of
Skalsey et al. [55] and Engbrecht et al. [57] give much lower
values, and the zero-energy cross section according to Eng-
brecht et al. [57] is not consistent with the measurements of
Canter et al. [52], Rytsola et al. [53], and Coleman et al. [54].
As we noted in Ref. [19], this may be because the meaure-
ments of Skalsey et al. [55] and Engbrecht et al. [57] are
based on Doppler-broadening spectroscopy, and they may suf-
fer from errors related to the discrimination of the narrow Ps
annihilation component on the background of the positron-He
annihilation signal.

For Ne, there is agreement with the results of Skalsey et
al. [55], but our calculations lie outside the error bars of the
measurement of Saito et al. [58], and we have an approxi-
mately 40% discrepancy with Coleman et al. [54]. For Ar,
there is agreement with the measurement by Nagashima et
al. [59], but the discrepancy with the results of Coleman et
al. [54], Skalsey et al. [55], and Sano et al. [60] is at the level
of 70, 60, and 300%, respectively. We again note that the gen-
eral trend of the experimental data for Ar is a rapid decrease of
the momentum-transfer cross section with increasing energy,
which is qualitatively similar to our results but faster than the
calculation predicts. Finally, for Xe, our momentum-transfer
cross section is approximately 30% larger than the experimen-
tal ﬁnding of Shibuya et al. [7]. However, as we explained in
Ref. [17], Shibuya et al. deduced this datum by comparing the
measured time evolution of the Ps center-of-mass energy 𝐸

of the computational expense required to calculate them. Note
that these cross sections have the same basic shape as the ear-
lier van der Waals cross section [17], coming into very close
agreement for 𝐾 (cid:38) 0.5 a.u. It is quite remarkable that using
a simple, local van der Waals potential with a single ﬁtting
parameter gives the cross section in such close agreement with
the sophisticated ab initio many-body-theory calculation. One
may conclude from this that this potential (with a judiciously
chosen cutoﬀ radius 𝑅0) captures well the physics of the Ps-
atom interaction. The calculation where neither the direct or
exchange screening diagrams are included is in stark contrast
to the others; the zero-energy cross section is more than a fac-
tor of 2 larger, and at 𝐾
0.2 a.u. it is almost a factor of 2
lower. It also has a distinctly diﬀerent momentum dependence.
It is the least computationally expensive of the three types
of approximation, but it is theoretically inconsistent, having
neglected the eﬀects of screening altogether. It serves as a
useful illustration of the importance of accounting for screen-
𝑅6 asymptotic behavior
ing (which ensures the correct
of the Ps-atom interaction) in order to obtain reliable results.
The unusual behavior is caused by the interplay of the 𝑆- and
𝑃-wave contributions to the total cross section. At low 𝐾, the
𝑆-wave phase shift 𝛿0 is actually positive (the scattering length
is negative, 𝐴 =
0.28 a.u., 𝛿0 passes
through zero and becomes negative, so the 𝑆 wave gives no
contribution to the total cross section at this point (producing
a Ramsauer-Townsend minimum). Coincidentally, the 𝑃-wave
partial cross section has a maximum at almost the same mo-
mentum, oﬀsetting the zero contribution of the 𝑆 wave.

35%, and 75%, respectively. A diﬀerence of about 20% is
not unexpected, because unlike the present frozen-target cal-
culations, the static-exchange calculations do not account for
distortion of the Ps projectile. As for the much larger dis-
crepancies with Refs. [66, 67], it was pointed out earlier by
Mitroy and Ivanov [48] that the model exchange interaction
used in Ref. [67] was of “dubious validity,” and the fact that
the value of 1𝑍eﬀ (
in Ref. [67] is in excellent agreement with
experiment [22] is a coincidence. In fact, this static-exchange
calculation is in poor agreement with the other static-exchange
calculations [63, 64]), and one of the authors of Ref. [66] later

admitted that an assumption made therein (that the direct po-

value of 1𝑍eﬀ (
increases in moving from He to Ne and from
Ne to Ar, but it decreases in moving from Ar to Kr and from
Kr to Xe. The frozen-target calculations of Mitroy and cowork-
ers [48, 49] similarly increase from He through to Ar and then
decrease from Ar through to Xe. These trends indicate that
distortion of the target atom and short-range electron-positron
correlations are much more important for heavier target atoms.
With regard to the experimental data [22, 68], the frozen-
target values of 1𝑍eﬀ (
are, unsurprisingly, an order of mag-
nitude too small, which is expected from a calculation that ne-
glects the distortion of the target atom and short-range electron-
positron correlations.

Our many-body-theory calculations of 1𝑍eﬀ (

ment at the level of 1–28% with the stochastic-variational cal-
culations of Mitroy and coworkers [48, 49] with inclusion of
the van der Waals interaction. They still underestimate the ex-
perimental data [22, 68] by a factor of 2–4 as a result of the
missing short-range electron-positron correlation eﬀects.

Including the vertex enhancement factors in Eq. (22) re-
sults in an order-of-magnitude increase in 1𝑍eﬀ (
from the
frozen-target value for all of the atoms. For He and Ne, there is
excellent agreement with experiment [22]—at the level of 5%
and 9%, respectively. In both cases, our calculation slightly
overestimates the experiment. For Ar, Kr, and Xe, our cal-
culations of 1𝑍eﬀ (
overestimate the experiment [22, 68] by
factors of 1.6, 1.9, and 2.0, respectively. The value of 1𝑍 (cid:48)eﬀ has
changed sign from positive (in the frozen-target approxima-
tion) to negative for Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe. Note that this sign
change occurs even if the many-body-theory Ps wave function
is used to calculate 1𝑍eﬀ without enhancement of the annihi-
lation vertex (see Table III). A possible explanation for this
phenomenon is as follows. In the frozen-target approximation,
the overall Ps-atom interaction is repulsive. With increasing
energy, the Ps overcomes this repulsion to some extent and
penetrates the target atom more, making pickoﬀ annihilation
> 0. When the Dyson-orbital states
more likely; hence 1𝑍 (cid:48)eﬀ
and screening corrections are used to construct the Ps wave
function, the dispersion interaction aﬀects the Ps mostly at
low energy; hence 1𝑍eﬀ (
increases signiﬁcantly. At higher
energy the eﬀect of electron- and positron-atom correlations
decreases, and values of 1𝑍eﬀ get closer to what they were
in the frozen-target approximation; hence 1𝑍 (cid:48)eﬀ reduces (and
happens to become negative for Ne, Ar, and Kr).
Our vertex-enhanced many-body-theory values of 1𝑍eﬀ (
0
)
increase monotonically with the number of target electrons, as
is observed in experiment [22, 68]. However, our theoretical
approach appears to systematically overestimate the measured
1𝑍eﬀ, and the discrepancy increases with increasing number of
atomic electrons. Possible explanations for this behavior are
as follows:

0
)

1. The Ps may be too strongly attracted to the target atom,
i.e., the correlation potential for the electron and/or
positron may be too strongly attractive. There is a possi-
blilty that the electron and positron self-energy and the
screening correction should all be smaller due to the fact
that the energy 𝐸 that appears in the denominators of
the corresponding diagrams should be negative, rather
than zero. This is investigated in Sec. IV C.

2. We may have overestimated the eﬀect of short-range
electron-positron correlations, i.e., the enhancement fac-
tors in Table I could be too large. This could be partly due
to using enhancement factors calculated using Hartree-
Fock states rather than Dyson states. However, using
the Dyson enhancement factors instead would still give
values of 1𝑍eﬀ signiﬁcantly larger than experiment for
Ar, Kr, and Xe. For example, for Xe, the enhance-
ment factor that most signiﬁcantly reduces in switch-
ing from Hartree-Fock to Dyson states is for an 𝑠-
wave positron annihilating on the 5𝑝 orbital; its value
changes from 9.26 to
6 [21]. Crudely scaling our cur-
rent value of 1𝑍eﬀ (
0.65 gives
9.26

)
0.61, still 30% larger than the experimental
1𝑍eﬀ (

) ≈
value of 0.48 [68]. And if we were to correctly change the
enhancement factors for each orbital and partial wave to
their Dyson values separately, we would obtain a value
even larger, as the enhancement factors for higher partial
waves and/or core orbitals change less signiﬁcantly.

3. The enhancement factors that were used were calcu-
lated for zero energy of the positron. However, when
the positron is “packaged” within Ps, the positron states
in the expansion (18) of the Ps wave function cover a
range of energies. It is possible that the contributions
of higher-energy positron states should not be enhanced
to the same degree as those of the lower-energy states.
However, it is not clear why this eﬀect would be more
important for the heavier noble-gas atoms.

C. Dependence of results on energy used in energy
denominators of diagrams

As we noted in Sec. II E, in calculating the self-energy of
the electron or positron in the ﬁeld of the atom and the screen-
ing corrections to the electron-positron Coulomb interaction
within Ps, the energy 𝐸 appears in the energy denominators
of the Goldstone diagrams, so we consistently calculated all
of the self-energy and screening diagrams at 𝐸 = 0. We now
brieﬂy investigate how changing the value of 𝐸 aﬀects the
scattering cross section and value of 1𝑍eﬀ (
The true value of 𝐸 in the energy denominators should be

calculated
for the electron and positron for the lowest-
energy Ps eigenstate for He, Ar, and Xe (with 𝐸 = 0), and
found typical values to be in the range 0.125–0.15 a.u. In-
deed, for a suﬃciently large cavity, the potential energy for
the electron or positron is mostly due to the Coulomb interac-
tion with the other particle (since in a large cavity, the Ps is
statistically likely to be found far away from the target atom).
The expected values of the Ps kinetic energy 𝑇 and potential
energy 𝑉 satisfy the virial theorem, 2

It is clear that for each atom, making the value of 𝐸 more
negative results in a larger cross section (although for Xe, in
the momentum range 𝐾
0.25 a.u.
cross section is smaller than the 𝐸 = 0 cross section, due to the
delicate interplay of the 𝑆- and 𝑃-wave contributions). This
occurs because making the energy denominators in the Gold-
stone diagrams more negative reduces their overall magnitude.
Thus, the attraction of the electron and positron to the target
atom (mainly due to the ﬁrst, polarization-type diagrams in
Fig. 1) is weakened, resulting in more negative phase shifts
and a larger scattering length. The change in the cross section
due to varying the value of 𝐸 is more pronounced at low Ps
momenta 𝐾 and for heavier target atoms. For He, changing the
0.375 a.u. increases the cross section at
value of 𝐸 from 0 to
𝐾 = 0 by 6%, while the corresponding increase for Xe is 40%.
Despite the signiﬁcant change for all atoms, the basic shape
of the cross section remains the same for all values of 𝐸, and
agreement with the experimental data [18] has not improved.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a many-body-theory approach to study-
ing low-energy Ps interactions with noble-gas atoms. The en-
tire Ps-atom system was enclosed in a hard-wall spherical

cavity. The Dyson equation was solved separately for the elec-
tron and positron moving in the ﬁeld of the target atom, and
the resulting states were used to construct the two-particle Ps
wave function. Construction of the Ps wave function in this
manner ensured that distortion of both the target atom and
the Ps were accurately accounted for. The two-particle Dyson
equation was solved, and the energies and wave functions of
the Ps eigenstates in the cavity were used to determine the scat-

Our calculations of the scattering cross section did not agree
with the experimental data for Ar and Xe of Brawley et al. [18].
In fact, it was found that the general shape of each cross section
was similar to that predicted by simpler calculations that mim-
icked distortion of the target atom using a long-range model
van der Waals potential [17], and the many-body-theory and
van der Waals calculations generally came into good agree-
ment for Ps momenta greater than 0.5 a.u. (at lower momenta,
the van der Waals cross sections are quite sensitive to the choice
of cutoﬀ radius used in the model potential [17]). Agreement
with measurements of the momentum-transfer cross sections
was also found to be mixed, though we note that measurements
by diﬀerent experimental groups are not always consistent.

Calculations of 1𝑍eﬀ in the frozen-target approximation (per-
formed by constructing the Ps wave function from Hartree-
Fock electron and positron states in the ﬁeld of the target
atom) gave values an order of magnitude below the experi-
mental value, due to the neglect of the eﬀects of target-atom
distortion and short-range electron-positron correlations. Ac-
counting for target-atom distortion by constructing the Ps wave
function from electron and positron Dyson states, and account-
ing for the short-range electron positron correlations by scaling
the atomic-orbital– and positron-partial-wave–speciﬁc contri-
butions to 1𝑍eﬀ by the annihilation vertex enhancement factors
from Ref. [21], we found values of 1𝑍eﬀ in excellent agreement
with experiment for He and Ne, and within a factor of 2 for Ar,
Kr, and Xe.

Finally, we investigated the eﬀect of changing the energy
𝐸 at which the electron and positron self-energy diagrams
and screening corrections to the electron-positron Coulomb
interaction were calculated. A value of 𝐸 = 0 had been used
0.25
throughout, but the calculations were repeated for 𝐸 =
0.375 a.u. Making 𝐸 more negative resulted in an over-
and
all less attractive Ps-atom interaction; thus, the scattering cross
sections increased and the values of 1𝑍eﬀ decreased. In going
0.375 a.u., the zero-energy cross section
from 𝐸 = 0 to 𝐸 =
increased by 6–40%, with the smallest (greatest) increase for
He (Xe). However, the basic shape of the cross sections was un-
changed, and no better agreement with the experimental data
for Ar and Xe [18] was obtained. As for the pickoﬀ annihila-
0.375 a.u.,
tion parameter 1𝑍eﬀ, in going from 𝐸 = 0 to 𝐸 =
the zero-energy values decreased by 5–45%, with the small-
est (greatest) decrease for He (Xe). This brought the values
of 1𝑍eﬀ for He and Ne into near-exact agreement with experi-

−

−

16

ment [22] and within a factor of 1.2 of experiment [22, 68] for
Ar, Kr, and Xe. Our calculations of 1𝑍eﬀ for Ps collisions with
noble-gas atoms are the only ones in the literature in which
the short-range electron-positron correlation eﬀects have been
accounted for, and serve as current benchmarks.

The work presented here represents a major step forward in
our understanding of low-energy Ps-atom interactions: virtual
target-atom excitations have now been included in Ps scatter-
ing by heavy atoms, and short-range electron-positron corre-
lations have been accounted for in 1𝑍eﬀ. However, there are
many ways in which the calculations could be improved and
extended. In the self-energy expansion for the electron-atom
interaction, only diagrams up to second order in the electron-
electron Coulomb interaction were included; similarly, only
second-order diagrams were included in the screening correc-
tion to the electron-positron Coulomb interaction within Ps.
Though technically cumbersome, it is possible to implement
higher-order corrections and check whether these signiﬁcantly
aﬀect the Ps-atom scattering cross section and pickoﬀ annihi-
lation rate. Also, the many-body theory used in the calculations
is nonrelativistic: all of the Goldstone diagrams were calcu-
lated using single-particle Hartree-Fock electron and positron
orbitals. Although we expect relativistic corrections to be small
for the Ps-atom problem, in principle, Dirac-Fock orbitals
could be used to account for these eﬀects. Further, we have
only considered elastic scattering of Ps by noble-gas atoms.
By investigating the nature of higher-energy states of Ps in
the ﬁeld of the target atom within the cavity, it may be possi-
ble to obtain information about inelastic scattering processes,
e.g., excitation and/or ionization of the Ps and/or target atom.
Lastly, although we have used the two-particle Ps wave func-
tion to calculate the pickoﬀ annihilation parameter 1𝑍eﬀ for
each atom, it could also be used to compute the cross sec-
tion of spin-orbit quenching, a spin-changing collision that
transforms orthopositronium (with mean lifetime 142 ns) into
parapositronium (with mean lifetime 0.125 ns), which rapidly
annihilates into two or more 𝛾 rays [70].

The persisting discord between calculated low-energy Ps-
atom scattering cross sections and experimental data is a cause
for concern. From the point of view of theory, to produce a
Ramsauer-Townsend minimum in the cross section, as pre-
dicted for Ar and Xe in Ref. [18], would require the overall
Ps-atom interaction at low energy to be attractive (indicated
by a positive 𝑆-wave phase shift, giving a negative scattering
length), becoming repulsive at intermediate energies (indi-
cated by the 𝑆-wave phase shift becoming negative). How-
ever, the excellent agreement we obtained with experiment for
1𝑍eﬀ leads us to believe that our many-body-theory approach
broadly captures the essential physics of the Ps-atom system
correctly. We hope that ongoing theoretical and experimen-
tal investigations will resolve the discrepancies for the cross
sections in the near future.

Appendix B: Eﬀective-range-theory ﬁts for scattering phase
shifts

The Ps scattering phase shifts are determined from the
Ps energy eigenvalues using the boundary condition on the
Ps center-of-mass motion at the cavity wall, as described in
Ref. [17]. Calculations were performed using cavity radii of
10, 12, 14, and 16 a.u. Eﬀective-range-type ﬁts were used to in-
terpolate the 𝑆, 𝑃, and 𝐷 phase shifts calculated at the discrete
values of the Ps center-of-mass momentum 𝐾. These ﬁts were
used to determine the scattering length and the partial contri-
butions to the elastic and momentum-transfer cross sections.
Here we detail the ﬁts for the phase shifts.

At low momenta 𝐾, the 𝑆-wave phase shift 𝛿0 behaves ac-

cording to

𝐾 cot 𝛿0 (cid:39) −

respectively, where 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝜀, 𝜁, 𝜂, 𝜆, and 𝜇 are constants [73].
We found that simple polynomial ﬁts obtained by truncating
these expansions tend to grow large as 𝐾

the following Padé-type ﬁts instead:

These ﬁts have the correct leading-order behavior as 𝐾

and vary relatively slowly at large 𝐾, as observed in the calcu-
lated phase shifts. Table V shows the values of the parameters
of the ﬁts for 𝛿𝐿 (𝐿 = 0, 1, 2) for He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe.
