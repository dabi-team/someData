ABSTRACT

Context. Atmospheric compositions oﬀer valuable clues to planetary formation and evolution. Jupiter has been the most well-studied
giant planet in terms of its atmosphere; however, the origin of the Jovian atmospheric composition remains a puzzle as the abundances
of nitrogen and noble gases as high as those of other elements could only originate from extremely cold environments.
Aims. We propose a novel idea for explaining the Jovian atmospheric composition: Dust pileup at the H2O snow line casts a shadow
and cools the Jupiter orbit so that N2 and noble gases can freeze. Planetesimals or a core formed in the shadowed region can enrich
nitrogen and noble gases as much as other elements through their dissolution in the envelope.
Methods. We compute the temperature structure of a shadowed protosolar disk with radiative transfer calculations. Then, we investi-
gate the radial volatile distributions and predict the atmospheric composition of Jupiter with condensation calculations.
Results. We ﬁnd that the vicinity of the current Jupiter orbit, approximately 3–7 AU, could be as cold as (cid:46) 30 K if the small-dust
surface density varies by a factor of (cid:38) 30 across the H2O snow line. According to previous grain growth simulations, this condition
could be achieved by weak disk turbulence if silicate grains are more fragile than icy grains. The shadow can cause the condensation
of most volatile substances, namely N2 and Ar. We demonstrate that the dissolution of shadowed solids can explain the elemental
abundance patterns of the Jovian atmosphere even if proto-Jupiter was formed near Jupiter’s current orbit.
Conclusions. The disk shadow may play a vital role in controlling atmospheric compositions. The eﬀect of the shadow also impacts
the interpretation of upcoming observations of exoplanetary atmospheres by JWST.

1. Introduction

Atmospheric compositions encapsulate the information on
planet formation. Jupiter has been the most well-studied gas gi-
ants in terms of atmospheric composition. Extensive observa-
tions by the Galileo probe, Cassini, and JUNO spacecraft have
revealed that O, C, N, S, P, Ar, Kr, and Xe are all uniformly
enriched from protosolar abundances by a factor of two to four
(Mahaﬀy et al. 2000; Wong et al. 2004; Fletcher et al. 2009;
Bolton et al. 2017; Li et al. 2020). The heavy-element enrich-
ment likely originates from planetesimals and/or pebbles dis-
solved in the atmosphere (e.g., Pollack et al. 1986; Iaroslavitz &
Podolak 2007; Hori & Ikoma 2011; Venturini et al. 2016) and/or
core erosion (e.g., Guillot et al. 2004; Moll et al. 2017). Intrigu-
ingly, the abundances of highly volatile elements, such as N and
Ar, are comparable to the other elemental abundances.

The origin of the uniformly enriched Jovian atmosphere has
been a long-standing puzzle because solid dissolution hardly en-
hances the highly volatile elements. Owen et al. (1999) sug-
gested that the uniform enrichment originates from planetesi-
mals formed in extremely cold (< 30 K) environments, where
noble gases can freeze. Öberg & Wordsworth (2019) suggested
that the uniform enrichment could be explained if the Jovian
core had formed beyond the Ar snow line, presumably placed at
> 30 AU (see also Bosman et al. 2019). However, the migration

of a core from > 30 AU to 5 AU is a rare occurrence, according
to theoretical studies on core formation and migration (Bitsch
et al. 2015, 2019). Even if such a migration occurs, the core ar-
rives at the current orbit at > 1 Myr (Alibert et al. 2005; Bitsch
et al. 2019). This is in tension with the isotope dichotomy of
meteorites, indicating that Jupiter may demarcate the inner and
outer Solar System within ∼ 1 Myr (Kruijer et al. 2017, 2020).

In this letter we propose an alternative idea to explain the
uniformly enriched Jovian atmosphere: The shadow cast by dust
pileup at the H2O snow line produced extremely cold environ-
ments near the current Jupiter orbit, leading to the formation
of volatile-rich solids there. The dissolution of such “shadowed
solids” can enrich the abundances of highly volatile elements as
much as other elements, even if proto-Jupiter formed near the
current orbit.

2. Method

2.1. Basic idea

The mid-plane temperature in the outer region of protoplanetary
disks is determined by the stellar irradiation grazing at the disk
surface. Since the stellar light comes from the center of the disk,
a shadowed region where the direct stellar light never reaches is
potentially generated, depending on the surface structure of the

inner region. For example, a puﬀed inner disk rim can block oﬀ
stellar light and cast a shadow, so-called self-shadowing (Dulle-
mond et al. 2001; Dullemond & Dominik 2004). The presence of
the self-shadow has been suggested from several disk observa-
tions (e.g., Garuﬁ et al. 2017; Avenhaus et al. 2018). The shadow
can also emerge when dust grains are accumulated somewhere
and block oﬀ the stellar light. Ueda et al. (2019) showed that a
dust pileup at the inner edge of the dead zone casts a shadow
behind it, producing cold regions of ∼50 K at ∼2–7 AU around
a Herbig-type star.

One potential mechanism of the shadowing onto the current
Jupiter orbit is a dust pileup at the H2O snow line. The dust sur-
face density inside the H2O snow line can be enhanced by or-
ders of magnitude because eﬃcient fragmentation slows the ra-
dial drift of silicate grains (Birnstiel et al. 2010; Banzatti et al.
2015; Pinilla et al. 2017). With high surface density and scale
height, such fragmented dust may cast a shadow behind the H2O
snow line and provide cold regions where volatile substances can
freeze. The primary purpose of this letter is to investigate how
cold this shadowed region is and what kinds of volatile gases
can freeze there.

2.2. Numerical model

We adopted a parameterized disk model in which the dust sur-
face density steeply varies around the H2O snow line, described
by

Σg = 670

where Σg is the gas surface density, Σd is the surface density
of the small dust (i.e., (cid:46) 100 µm) contributing to the opacity,
and RSL is the radial location of the H2O snow line set to RSL =
1.3 AU. We varied the parameter fSL to examine the eﬀects of the
dust pileup magnitude. The actual value of fSL depends on how
easily the fragmentation of silicate and icy grains takes place,
which is controlled by the turbulence strength and stickiness of
the grains (Birnstiel et al. 2010; Banzatti et al. 2015; Pinilla et al.
2017). For example, Banzatti et al. (2015) reported the surface
density variations of fSL ∼ 0.1, 0.001, and 0.01 around the H2O
snow line for the turbulence strengths of αt = 10−2, 10−3, and
10−4, respectively.

With the radial density proﬁle, we calculated the tempera-
ture structure of the shadowed region using the Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code RADMC-3D (Dullemond et al. 2012).
Since the vertical dust distribution and the temperature structure
are mutually dependent, the radiative transfer calculations were
iteratively performed to obtain the self-consistent disk struc-
ture (Ueda et al. 2019). The simulations also included the in-
ternal energy released by the disk accretion with a form of
ΩK with αt = 3 × 10−4, where ρg is the gas
qacc = (9/4)αtρgc2
s
density, cs is the sound speed, and ΩK is the Keplerian frequency.
We adopted the DSHARP dust opacity model with the minimum
and maximum dust radii of 0.1 and 100 µm (Birnstiel et al. 2018;
see also Henning & Stognienko 1996; Draine 2003; Warren &
Brandt 2008).

Using the computed temperature structure, we estimated the
mid-plane volatile abundances in gas and solid phases at each
orbital distance by balancing condensation and sublimation rates

(Appendix B). Following Öberg & Wordsworth (2019), we per-
formed the calculation for H2O, CO2, CO, C2H6, N2, NH3, Ar,
Kr, and Xe based on the up-to-date protosolar abundances in As-
plund et al. (2021). We then estimated the elemental abundance
of the Jovian atmosphere, Ni/NH, using volatile abundances of
gas and solids at 5 AU, as (see Appendix B.2)

sulfur to evaluate MZ/Menv since most sulfur likely exists as re-
fractory solids (Kama et al. 2019). We adjusted MZ/Menv so that
the S abundance matches the observed S abundance of Jupiter
and then calculated other elemental abundances. We also esti-
mated the atmospheric composition of Saturn from solid- and
gas-phase volatile abundances at 10 AU using the same proce-
dure.

3. Results

3.1. Mid-plane temperature in a shadowed disk
Figure 1 shows the mid-plane temperature for diﬀerent fSL. In
general, the temperature inside the H2O snow line is indepen-
dent of fSL and is primarily controlled by viscous heating, yield-
ing the radial dependence of ∝ r−9/10 (e.g., Oka et al. 2011). The
temperature structures with diﬀerent fSL converge to a similar
ﬂared disk solution of T ∝ r−1/2 at >∼ 10 AU (Kenyon & Hart-
mann 1987), implying that these regions are directly irradiated
by sunlight.

The dust pileup at the H2O snow line drastically alters the
mid-plane temperature at ∼2–10 AU owing to shadow forma-
tion. The temperature at ∼2–10 AU decreases with decreasing
fSL, as the shadow extends to more outer regions. Even a small
change in dust surface density with fSL = 0.3 causes the cooling
of ∼ 20 K from a non-shadowed disk with fSL = 1. Remarkably,
the shadow cools the vicinity of the current Jupiter orbit, ∼ 3–
7 AU, to < 30 K for fSL < 0.03. Although the dust-to-gas mass
ratio inside the H2O snow line may be higher than that assumed
here, especially in the young disks of <∼ 1 Myr (e.g., Birnstiel
et al. 2010), we have conﬁrmed that the shadow can still cool the
Jupiter orbit to < 30 K in that case (Appendix C).

3.2. Radial volatile distributions

Most volatile substances freeze in the cold shadowed regions.
Figure 2 shows the radial distributions of volatile abundances
in solids and gases for fSL = 0.03. In the shadowed disk,
CO2, C2H6, and NH3 have snow lines at nearly the same or-
bit, ∼1.5 AU. These crowded snow lines originate from the steep
temperature gradient in the shadow right behind the H2O snow
line. CO, N2, Ar, and Kr exhibit intriguing orbital distributions:
They freeze into solids at ∼ 3–7 AU but return to gas phases at
>∼ 7 AU. These volatile distributions are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from conventional non-shadowed disks (e.g., Öberg et al. 2011;
Öberg & Wordsworth 2019).

The magnitude of the dust pileup at the H2O snow line deter-
mines if volatile substances can freeze in shadowed regions. The

if we approximate Menv≈Mp. This is well below the total heavy
element mass of ∼8–36M⊕, the upper limit allowed for dissolved
volatile mass, constrained by JUNO (Wahl et al. 2017; Ni 2019).
The estimated abundance pattern explains the uniform enrich-
ment observed in the Jovian atmosphere well.

In our shadow scenario, Saturn, in contrast to Jupiter, may
not undergo the uniform enrichment. This is because Saturn’s
orbit is near the outer edge of the shadowed regions; this area
is too warm to allow the condensation of N2 and noble gases,
although this depends on the gas and dust disk properties. As a
result, N and Ar abundances become signiﬁcantly lower than the
others. The estimated elemental abundances explain the C, N, P,
and S abundances of Saturn well, although the N, P, and S abun-
dances are still uncertain (see Atreya et al. 2018). A possible de-
pletion of N and noble gases is intriguing because other uniform
enrichment scenarios, such as the accretion of volatile-enriched
disk gases (e.g., Guillot & Hueso 2006; Monga & Desch 2015;
Ali-Dib 2017; Mousis et al. 2019), would likely result in the uni-
form enrichment on Saturn being similar to that on Jupiter. Since
noble gas abundances can only be constrained by in situ mea-
surements, future entry probe missions on Saturn (Mousis et al.
2016; Simon et al. 2018) would help to distinguish the shadow
scenario from other scenarios.

4. Discussion

4.1. Implications for Jupiter formation

There are two possible pathways to incorporate shadowed solids
into the Jovian atmosphere: core dissolution and solid accretion
after envelope formation. In the former case, the shadow sce-
nario suggests that the Jovian core may form near the current or-
bit via planetesimal (e.g., Pollack et al. 1996; Inaba et al. 2003;
Kobayashi & Tanaka 2018) and/or pebble accretion (e.g., Lam-
brechts & Johansen 2012; Lambrechts et al. 2014). The upward
mixing of the dissolved core could enrich the envelope if pri-
mordial composition gradients exist (Guillot et al. 2004; Vazan
et al. 2018). The JUNO observations do suggest the presence of
a dissolved core (Wahl et al. 2017; Ni 2019). In the latter case,
the core could be formed elsewhere. Based on isotopes in mete-
orites, Alibert et al. (2018) suggested that substantial planetes-
imal accretion occurred on Jupiter during the envelope accre-
tion. Conversely, the capture of planetesimals is ineﬃcient for
gap-opening Jupiter, and an enhanced surface density of plan-
etesimals may have been needed to achieve suﬃcient enrichment
(Shibata & Ikoma 2019). It is vital to understand how many plan-
etesimals form in the shadowed regions.

4.2. Implications from disk observations

Recent observations of protoplanetary disks have shown that
shadow-like structures are common in scattered light images
(Avenhaus et al. 2018; Garuﬁ et al. 2018). The origin of these
structures is still unclear, but most of them are observed at the
outer region (>10 AU) and hence would not be related to the
H2O snow line. Due to the limited angular resolution and the
bright emission coming directly from the central star, it is still
challenging to constrain the disk surface structure within 10
AU. However, the prevalence of the shadow on the disk surface
implies that the disk temperature no longer follows the simple
power-law proﬁle.

Interestingly, recent multiwavelength studies of the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have shown that
ring and gap structures reside even in the optically thick region

proﬁles of small dust. (Bottom) Mid-plane temperature at each orbital
distance. Diﬀerent colored lines show the proﬁles for diﬀerent fSL.

bottom right panel of Fig. 2 shows the solid-phase abundance of
Ar, the most volatile substance in our model. For fSL = 1 and
0.3, Ar only freezes at outer regions of > 20 AU. On the other
hand, Ar freezes in solids at ∼ 3.5–6 AU for fSL = 0.03 and at
∼ 2.5–8 AU for fSL = 0.003. Thus, highly volatile substances
can freeze even at the current Jupiter orbit if the small-dust sur-
face density varies by a factor of >∼ 30 across the H2O snow line.

3.3. Comparison with Jovian atmospheric composition

Figure 3 compares the estimated elemental abundances of the
Jovian atmosphere with those constrained by observations. In
weakly shadowed disks of fSL ≥ 0.3, N and noble gases have al-
most protosolar abundances as they are still present in gas phases
at ∼ 5 AU, inconsistent with the observations. On the other hand,
N and noble gases can be enriched as much as other elements for
fSL ≤ 0.03 as the cold shadowed regions cause the condensation
of N2 and noble gases at 5 AU. The estimated dissolved volatile
mass is MZ/Menv = 0.022 for fSL ≤ 0.03, equivalent to ≈ 7M⊕

(Carrasco-González et al. 2019; Macías et al. 2021). This im-
plies that the substructures are induced by the temperature vari-
ation and/or intensity reduction from scattering (e.g., Liu 2019;
Zhu et al. 2019; Sierra & Lizano 2020; Ueda et al. 2020), not
by the density variation. For example, the HL Tau disk has a gap
at ∼13 AU at the wavelength where the region is expected to be
optically thick (Carrasco-González et al. 2019). This gap might
be linked with a shadow cast by the H2O snow line, which is
expected to be located at ∼ 10 AU. However, the dust size in the
inner region of the HL Tau disk is unlikely to be smaller than that
at >10 AU (Carrasco-González et al. 2019; Ueda et al. 2021). To
precisely estimate the dust size and the disk temperature, multi-
wavelength millimeter observations with more than four wave-
lengths are needed, which have only been conducted for a few
disks. The future multiwavelength ALMA observations would
tell us if the gap is associated with the shadow.

4.3. Diagnostic ratios for exoplanet observations
It is generally expected that the C/O ratios of exoplanetary atmo-
spheres are linked to the compositions of protoplanetary disks
(e.g., Öberg et al. 2011; Madhusudhan et al. 2014; Mordasini

Article number, page 4 of 9

et al. 2016; Booth et al. 2017; Cridland et al. 2020; Notsu et al.
2020; Miley et al. 2021). In shadowed disks, the solid C/O ratio
reaches the solar value in shadowed regions, similar to the outer
disk (Fig. 4). The gas C/O ratio is almost unity at >∼ 2 AU be-
cause CO accommodates most of the gas-phase C and O there.
Thus, planets formed in the shadowed regions would have atmo-
spheres with C/O ratios similar to those formed in the outer parts
of protoplanetary disks.

It is worth noting that the N/O ratio shows a spatial variation
that is much larger than that of the C/O ratio (Fig. 4). The solid
N/O ratio reaches a solar value in the shadowed region as all N
and O reservoirs freeze. Interestingly, the gas N/O ratio exceeds
unity in the shadowed region because N2 has a desorption energy
lower than that of CO, leading to a higher N2 vapor abundance.
Thus, the planets formed in the shadow would have atmospheres
with solar N/O and super-solar metallicity (the case of Jupiter) or
N/O> 1 and sub-solar metallicity. Exoplanetary nitrogen abun-
dances can be constrained by the observations of NH3 and HCN
(MacDonald & Madhusudhan 2017a,b). These molecules would
be detectable by the upcoming observations of the James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST).

atmospheric elemental abundances using the volatile abundances at 5 AU for Jupiter and 10 AU for Saturn. The empty dots denote the abundances

the protosolar abundances of Asplund et al. (2021), and we also plot the abundances normalized by the protosolar abundances of Lodders et al.

oxygen abundance at the deep equatorial region of Jupiter retrieved by JUNO (Li et al. 2020). We caution that the observed P abundances may not
represent the bulk abundances, that the N abundance in Saturn may be a lower limit, and that the S abundance in Saturn is model dependent (see
Atreya et al. 2018).

5. Summary

Acknowledgements

The disk shadow may signiﬁcantly aﬀect disk temperature struc-
tures and planetary compositions. If the dust surface density
varies by a factor of >∼ 30 (i.e., fSL <∼ 0.03) across the H2O snow
line, the vicinity of the current Jupiter orbit could be shadowed
and as cold as <∼ 30 K. We have demonstrated that the uniformly
enriched Jovian atmosphere could be explained if the Jovian core
was formed in the shadowed regions or if the envelope expe-
rienced shadowed solid dissolution. The required condition of
fSL <∼ 0.03 was observed for αt <∼ 10−3 in previous grain growth
simulations that assumed the fragmentation velocity to be 1 and
10 m s−1 for silicate and H2O ice grains (Birnstiel et al. 2010;
Banzatti et al. 2015; Pinilla et al. 2017). Such a weak turbulence
may be compatible with recent ALMA observations of several
protoplanetary disks (e.g., Pinte et al. 2016; van Boekel et al.
2017; Flaherty et al. 2020). The past cold environment can be
compatible with ammoniated rocks discovered on several Jupiter
Trojan asteroids, Jupiter-family comets, and (1) Ceres (de Sanc-
tis et al. 2015; Brown 2016; Poch et al. 2020). Although these
indications of cold environments can be explained by the dy-
namical scattering of objects from the outer Solar System (e.g.,
Morbidelli et al. 2005), the shadow scenario might provide an
alternative explanation.

Figure 5 schematically summarizes our shadow scenario. In
reality, since the location of the H2O snow line evolves over time
(e.g., Garaud & Lin 2007; Oka et al. 2011; Dr ˛a˙zkowska & Dulle-
mond 2018; Mori et al. 2021), the shadow location would evolve
as well. The shadow may also disappear once Jupiter opens up a
gap and shuts oﬀ drifting pebbles (Morbidelli et al. 2016). Fur-
ther modeling on time-evolving disks with the shadow is war-
ranted to understand how the shadow impacts planetary forma-
tion and compositions, which will be the subjects of our future
studies.

Appendix A: Elemental abundances

Recently, Asplund et al. (2021) provided new recommended
compositions of the protosun, which we have adopted in this
study. Table A.1 summarizes the up-to-date elemental abun-
dances of the protosun along with the abundances of Jupiter and
Saturn normalized by them. We note that the protosolar abun-
dances are higher than the photospheric abundances of the cur-
rent Sun (see Sect. 5 of Asplund et al. 2021).

Appendix B: Condensation model

Appendix B.1: Model description

Here we describe the condensation model we used for evalu-
ating volatile distributions. The abundances can be evaluated
by equating condensation and sublimation rates (e.g., Öberg &
Wordsworth 2019). The former is given by

Rcond,i =

σgr
4

Ng,ivth,i,

(B.1)

√

where σgr is the total grain surface area per unit volume calcu-
lated from the dust size distribution used in the radiative trans-
fer model, Ng,i is the number density of gas-phase atoms or
molecules, and vth,i =
8kBT/πmi and mi are the mean thermal
velocity and mass of species i atoms or molecules, respectively.
We note that the gas-phase number density is associated with the
total number density, Nt,i, as
Nt,i = Ng,i + σgrnd,i,

(B.2)

where nd,i is molecular or atomic surface number density on
grain surfaces.

The sublimation behavior depends on how much the
molecules or atoms are adsorbed onto the grain surface. In a low
surface density regime where all adsorbed particles are exposed,
the sublimation rate is proportional to the surface density, so-
called ﬁrst-order desorption (e.g., Collings et al. 2003). As the
surface density increases, two factors aﬀect the sublimation rate.
The ﬁrst is that only particles in a few of the uppermost molec-
ular or atomic layers can directly desorb from the grain surface,
leading to the upper limit of “desorption active” surface density
to be set at nd,i ∼ 1015 cm−2 (e.g., Collings et al. 2003). The
second is that the desorption energy decreases with increasing
surface coverage of molecules or atoms owing to the increased
number of particles weakly bound on the surface (Fayolle et al.

Article number, page 8 of 9

2016; He et al. 2016). In the limit of the high surface density of
adsorbed molecules or atoms, one can expect that the sublima-
tion rate eventually approaches the rate of pure ice, which has
been studied in the context of cloud microphysics in planetary
atmospheres (e.g., Pruppacher & Klett 1996).

Based on this consideration, we modeled the sublimation rate

as

Rsubl,i = σgr min

(cid:34)

(cid:32)

νind,i exp

−

(cid:33)

,

Edes,i
kBT

Ps,i
4kBT

(cid:35)
,

vth,i

(B.3)

where Edes and ν are the desorption energy and attempt fre-
quency of particles adsorbed onto grains and Ps is the vapor pres-
sure. Equation (B.3) returns to the ﬁrst-order desorption rate at
low nd,i (e.g., Collings et al. 2003) and ensures that the sublima-
tion rate approaches that of pure ice in the limit of high nd,i (e.g.,
Pruppacher & Klett 1996). The vapor pressure of each substance
is taken from Fray & Schmitt (2009).

Our condensation model assumes that the dust and gas share
the same temperature, which is mostly valid at the dense disk
mid-plane. In the disk mid-plane, which the high-energy stellar
photons hardly penetrate, gas particles tend to have lower tem-
peratures than dust. The gas heating rate by collisions with dust
is given by (e.g., Tielens 2005)

mgngascp

dTgas
dt

= 2ngasngrπa2vgkB(Tgr − Tgas)αa,

(B.4)

where mg is the mean mass of gas particles, cp is the spe-
ciﬁc heat capacity, πa2 is the mean cross section of dust, vg =
(cid:112)
8kBTgas/πmg is the mean thermal velocity, αa ∼ 0.15 is the ac-
commodation coeﬃcient, ngas and ngr are the number densities
of gas and dust, and Tgr and Tgas are the dust and gas tempera-
tures. The timescale with which the gas temperature is relaxed
to the dust temperature, Tdust(dTgas/dt)−1, is given by

τrelax ≈

We used (4πa3ρd/3)ngr = fdΣg/(
2πcsΩ−1) and kB/mgcp = (1 −
γ−1), where γ = 7/5 is the adiabatic index for diatomic gases, ρd
is the dust internal density, Ω is the Kepler frequency, and fd is
the dust-to-gas mass ratio. We assumed ρd = 3 g cm−3 and the
solar mass. The lowest dust-to-gas mass ratio is fd = 3 × 10−5
in this study. Even in this case, the relaxing timescale is ∼ 3 yr,
still much shorter than the timescale of disk evolution.

Appendix B.2: Atmospheric composition estimation

We estimated the atmospheric elemental abundances of Jupiter
and Saturn by summing up disk gas and solid contributions. Let
Ni denote the total number of a species i element in the envelope.
The total number can be written as

Ni = NH

Ng,i
Ng,H

+ MZ

qd,i

(B.6)

where NH is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the enve-
lope and qd,i = mind,i/ (cid:80) mind,i is the mass mixing ratio of the
species i element in dissolved solids. We have reasonably as-
sumed that hydrogen comes mostly from disk gases. Using the
envelope mass of Menv ≈ mHNH + mHeNHe, where NHe is the

Fig. C.1. Same as Fig. 1, but the dust surface density is an order of
magnitude higher than that assumed in Fig. 1 (Eq. C.1).

We adopted the desorption energy for the atoms and
molecules adsorbed onto compact amorphous water ices as H2O
is the most abundant ice. We used the simultaneously measured
attempt frequency, ν, if available; otherwise, we adopted a con-
ventionally used value of 1012 s−1 (e.g., Penteado et al. 2017).
The desorption energy is potentially higher than that assumed
here if the amorphous water ices have porous structures in cold
environments (e.g., Ayotte et al. 2001; Fayolle et al. 2016). In
that case, the shadow would further expand the regions where
highly volatile substances can freeze.

disks

where mH+He = (mHNH +mHeNHe)/(NH +NHe) is the mean mass
of the hydrogen-helium mixture and md = (cid:80) mind,i/ (cid:80) nd,i is the
mean mass of the dissolved volatiles.

Appendix B.3: Material properties

Table B.1 summarizes the total abundances, desorption energy,
and desorption attempt frequency of the atoms and molecules
considered in this study. We determined each volatile abundance
following the procedure from Öberg & Wordsworth (2019) that
is motivated by the composition of the interstellar medium. We
set the absolute abundances so that they sum up to the protoso-
lar abundance recommended by Asplund et al. (2021), as sum-
marized in Table A.1. We partitioned oxygen into refractory sili-
cates (33.33%), H2O (33.33%), CO (16.67%), and CO2 (8.33%).
The above estimated CO and CO2 abundances comprise about
45% of the total carbon abundance. We partitioned the remain-
ing carbons into volatile organics (25%) and refractory organics
(75%), where the volatile organics are represented by C2H6, as
in Öberg & Wordsworth (2019). Nitrogen was partitioned into
N2 (90%) and NH3 (10%). The total abundances of Ar, Kr, and
Xe are the same as the protosolar abundances. We partitioned all
S and P into refractory solids. The actual abundance of each el-
ement reservoir is uncertain, as noted by Öberg & Wordsworth
(2019). However, the detail of each abundance hardly aﬀects the
conclusions of this study as all elements are eventually frozen
into solids when the disk is so cold that N2 and Ar can freeze.

While we have assumed the dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01 inside
the H2O snow line, the ratio is likely higher in the younger disks
that may be more relevant to the formation of Jupiter. Figure C.1
shows the disk mid-plane temperature for the higher dust surface
density of

Here we conducted the calculations only for fSL = 0.003 and
0.03. It should be noted that fSL should be less than 0.1; oth-
erwise, the dust-to-gas mass ratio of the whole disk exceeds
the interstellar value of 0.01. Figure C.1 shows that the shadow
cools the vicinity of the current Jupiter orbit to < 30 K even in
the young dust-rich disks. Thus, we expect that the shadow sce-
nario still holds for relatively young disks. We note that the snow
line moves outward as the dust surface density inside the H2O
snow line increases. In Fig. C.1, we adopt αt = 10−4 instead of
αt = 3×10−4 to keep the snow line at ∼ 2 AU. The actual location
of the H2O snow line depends on the gas and dust disk proper-
ties (Oka et al. 2011; Dr ˛a˙zkowska & Dullemond 2018) as well
as the accretion mechanism (Mori et al. 2019, 2021). Therefore,
comprehensive parameter studies would be necessary to further
understand the shadowing eﬀects on forming giant planets.
