ABSTRACT
Atomic data are an important source of systematic uncertainty in our determinations
of nebular chemical abundances. However, we do not have good estimates of these
uncertainties since it is very diﬃcult to assess the accuracy of the atomic data in-
volved in the calculations. We explore here the size of these uncertainties by using 52
diﬀerent sets of transition probabilities and collision strengths, and all their possible
combinations, to calculate the physical conditions and the total abundances of O, N,
S, Ne, Cl, and Ar for a sample of planetary nebulae and H ii regions. We ﬁnd that
atomic data variations introduce diﬀerences in the derived abundance ratios as low as
0.1–0.2 dex at low density, but that reach or surpass 0.6–0.8 dex at densities above 104
cm−3 in several abundance ratios, like O/H and N/O. Removing from the 52 datasets
the four datasets that introduce the largest diﬀerences, the total uncertainties are re-
duced, but high density objects still reach uncertainty factors of four for their values
of O/H and N/O. We identify the atomic data that introduce most of the uncertainty,
which involves the ions used to determine density, namely, the transition probabilities
of the S+, O+, Cl++, and Ar+3 density diagnostic lines, and the collision strengths
of Ar+3. Improved calculations of these data will be needed in order to derive more
reliable values of chemical abundances in high density nebulae. In the meantime, our
results can be used to estimate the uncertainties introduced by atomic data in nebular
abundance determinations.

1 INTRODUCTION

The determination of chemical abundances in ionized nebu-
lae requires the use of atomic data, such as transition prob-
abilities and collision strengths, whose values are derived
from theoretical calculations. The accuracy of these data is
diﬃcult to assess, since experimental measurements are gen-
erally unavailable and cannot be easily obtained. When there
are several atomic data calculations for the same ion, it is
not unusual to ﬁnd important diﬀerences between them. For
example, Galavis et al. (1997) compare transition probabil-
ities from various sources and ﬁnd diﬀerences around 10–20
per cent for most transitions, but that reach or exceed 50 per
cent in some cases. Similarly, Grieve et al. (2014) ﬁnd dif-
ferences of up to 50 per cent when comparing their collision
strengths for S++ with previous calculations. The discrep-
ancies can be due to errors in the atomic codes or to the
diﬀerent approximations that must necessarily be made in
order to perform the calculations, making the assessment

of atomic data a very complex issue (Aggarwal & Keenan
2013).

Several works have explored the eﬀects of using diﬀer-
ent atomic data in the determination of physical conditions
and chemical abundances in ionized nebulae, ﬁnding that the
choice of data can have a signiﬁcant impact on the results
(e.g. Rodr´ıguez 1999; Copetti & Writzl 2002; Wang et al.
2004; Luridiana & Garc´ıa-Rojas 2012; Stasi´nska et al. 2013;
Mendoza & Bautista 2014). However, a single set of atomic
data can aﬀect all the calculations, and diﬀerent combina-
tions of atomic data will aﬀect the results in complex ways.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has explored
the combined eﬀect of using many diﬀerent datasets for all
the observed ions, propagating the diﬀerences through all
the calculations.

Here we use pyneb, a code for the analysis of nebu-
lar emission lines developed by Luridiana, Morisset & Shaw
(2015), and the 52 atomic datasets of transition probabili-
ties and collision strengths that it includes for nine ions, in
order to explore the dispersion introduced by atomic data in
the determination of physical conditions and chemical abun-

dances in a sample of 36 PNe and 8 H ii regions that have the
best available spectra in the literature. Assuming that the
atomic data calculated by diﬀerent authors with diﬀerent
approximations provide good estimates of atomic data un-
certainties, our results can be used to constrain the system-
atic uncertainties introduced by atomic data in the physical
conditions and chemical abundances of ionized nebulae.

2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA

Most determinations of chemical abundances in ionized neb-
ulae are based on the analysis of optical spectra. Hence,
we have selected a sample of 36 PNe and eight H ii regions
with available optical spectra which are deep enough to al-
low the measurement of a large number of emission lines
that can be used to derive physical conditions and chemi-
cal abundances. The sample objects cover a wide range in
characteristics such as excitation degree and electron den-
sity, and in that sense can be considered representative of
the population of ionized nebulae. We used as initial se-
lection criteria the presence in the published spectra of
lines belonging to the four most used density diagnostics,
[S ii] λ 6716/λ 6731, [O ii] λ 3726/λ 3729, [Cl iii] λ 5518/λ 5538,
and [Ar iv] λ 4711/λ 4740, and the two most used temper-
ature diagnostics, [N ii] λ 5755/(λ 6548 + λ 6583) and [O iii]
λ 4363/(λ 4959 + λ 5007). Besides these diagnostics, the spec-
tra of the sample allow us to derive the ionic abundances
of O+, O++, N+, Cl++, Ar++, Ar+3, Ne++, S+, and S++
from collisionally excited lines, in addition to the total abun-
dances of the corresponding elements. Since the initial selec-
tion lacked nebulae having both low density, ne <
∼ 103 cm−3,
and a low degree of ionization, log(O+/O++) > 0.6, we added
to the sample the Galactic H ii regions M16 and M20, even
though the [Ar iv] density diagnostic is not available for
these objects.

(Garc´ıa-Rojas et al. 2007).

3 ATOMIC DATA

The emissivities of the collisionally excited lines that we will
be using can be obtained by solving the equations of statis-
tical equilibrium for the lower laying 5–8 levels of each ion
(Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). All downward radiative tran-
sitions, electron collisional excitations and de-excitations
are included in the calculations. Therefore, the results of

these calculations depend on the values used for the Ein-
stein coeﬃcients, Ai j, and the eﬀective collision strengths,
ϒi j (the Maxwellian-averaged collision strengths). Recombi-
nation can also contribute to the population of the upper
levels of some transitions. This eﬀect can be important for
at least one of the lines we are using, [N ii] λ 5755 (Rubin
1986; Liu et al. 2000), as we discuss in Section 4.1.

Table 1 shows the atomic datasets of transition proba-
bilities and collision strengths that are included in pyneb for
the ions that we are considering in our calculations. For ease
of comparison, we adopt the same notation used in pyneb
for the atomic data references. The datasets established by
default in pyneb are labelled with the letter D; the other
datasets are assigned a number n that we will use for iden-
tiﬁcation purposes below. Note that some datasets include
data from diﬀerent works and that not all datasets are in-
dependent. For example, the sets of collisions strengths for
O+ identiﬁed as 8 and 9 in Table 1 both include data from
Pradhan (1976) and McLaughlin & Bell (1993) but these
data are used for diﬀerent transitions in each dataset.

For each transition where three or more calculations of
the collision strengths or transition probabilities are avail-
able in pyneb, we have calculated the geometric mean of
these atomic data. Fig. 1 shows the distributions of the devi-
ations from these geometric means of the collision strengths
(for an electron temperature Te = 10000 K, top panel) and
the transition probabilities (bottom panel). Most results can
be seen to be within 0.1 dex of the mean value but the
data for some transitions have large diﬀerences. We iden-
tify in Fig. 1 the data that show the largest departures
from the mean values. Besides, there are three values of the
collision strengths calculated by Tayal & Gupta (1999) for
S++ that fall outside of the range plotted in Fig. 1. They
correspond to the transitions 1–2, 3–4, and 1–5, and have
log ϒi j− < log ϒi j >= −1.01, −1.19, and −1.65, respectively.
Most of the diﬀerences have a large impact on the calcula-
tions, especially so for the data involved in density determi-
nations, as we show below.

The ionic and total abundances are derived with respect
to hydrogen, and the He+ and He++ abundances are used to
determine the ionization correction factor for oxygen. Hence,
we need the eﬀective recombination coeﬃcients for H+, He+,
and He++. We use for these ions the data available in pyneb,
namely, the calculations of Storey & Hummer (1995) for H+,
Porter et al. (2012, 2013) for He+, and Storey & Hummer
(1995) for He++.

4 ANALYSIS

We want to explore the impact of the atomic data diﬀerences
on the determinations of physical conditions and chemical
abundances in our sample of H ii regions and PNe. In prin-
ciple, this requires that we perform all calculations for each
object using all possible combinations of the atomic data
listed in Table 1, obtaining in this way distributions of val-
ues for the electron temperatures, electron densities, and
ionic and total abundances for each object. The total num-
ber of combinations of the 52 sets of atomic data in Table 1
is 67,184,640. However, most of these combinations will not
introduce signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the results. In particular,
the atomic data used for Ne++, S++, or Ar++ will only af-

fect the abundance determination of the corresponding ion,
since these ions are not used for the determination of phys-
ical conditions. However, since all the calculations depend
on the values used for the electron density and temperature,
the atomic data used for the other ions, N+, O+, O++, S+,
Cl++, and Ar3+, will aﬀect all the determinations of physi-
cal conditions and ionic and total abundances. If we restrict
the number of combinations of atomic data to be explored
to those involving the second set of ions, we get 466,560

combinations. This is still a large number and, again, not
all these combinations will introduce signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in our results.

We decided to simplify the procedure in the following
way. For four objects, the PNe H 1-50 and NGC 5189 and
the H ii regions 30 Doradus and M17, we performed all the
necessary calculations. We then used these results to explore
the amount of sampling of atomic data combinations that
is required in order to reproduce to within ten per cent the
shapes of the ﬁnal distributions of physical conditions and
ionic and total abundances.

We start the sampling with the atomic data used by de-
fault in pyneb and perform all the calculations. We follow
by randomly selecting one set of atomic data from the 52
listed in Table 1 and use it to repeat all the calculations,
keeping ﬁxed the other datasets from the previous calcula-
tion. The procedure is then repeated. At each iteration, all
atomic data, except for the set that is replaced by another
set of atomic data, are left ﬁxed. The changes made in each
iteration are kept for the next cycle until the sampling is
completed.

We ﬁnd that with around 44,000 to 48,000 iterations we
can reproduce the distributions of physical conditions and

ionic and total abundances in the four reference objects to
better than ten per cent (using bin sizes of 0.05 dex in den-
sity, 0.01 dex in temperature, and 0.02 dex in ionic and total
abundances). Therefore, we decided to set the total number
of iterations to 50,000 in order to analize the remaining ob-
jects in the sample.

4.1 Physical conditions

We estimate the electron densities in each object using
the intensity ratios [S ii] λ 6716/λ 6731, [O ii] λ 3726/λ 3729,
[Cl iii] λ 5518/λ 5538, and [Ar iv] λ 4711/λ 4740. The excep-
tions are the H ii regions M16, M17, and M20, where we
could not use the last diagnostic because the [Ar iv] λ 4740
line was not measured (in M16 and M20) or was too weak to
lead to a viable diagnostic. We use the average of the den-
sities obtained with the four (or three) diagnostics in each
calculation, although we also explore in Section 5.1 below
the eﬀect of using just one density diagnostic.

We consider two ionizations zones in the nebula, which
are characterized by the two temperatures derived from
the line intensity ratios [N ii] λ 5755/(λ 6548 + λ 6583) and
[O iii] λ 4363/(λ 4959 + λ 5007), although they have the same
average density. We use Te[N ii] for all calculations involving
the singly ionized ions, excepting He+, and Te[O iii] for the
remaining ions.

The upper level of [N ii] λ 5755, and hence the intensity
of this line, can be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the recombi-
nation of N++ in some objects (Rubin 1986). When there
are measurements of N ii recombination lines in the opti-
cal or [N iii] collisionally excited lines in the infrared or ul-
traviolet ranges, one can calculate the N++ abundance and
correct for this eﬀect using an expression derived by Liu
et al. (2000). Of those objects in the sample that have esti-
mates of this correction, the PN NGC 7662 shows the largest
diﬀerence in Te[N ii], with its value decreasing 1000 K af-
ter subtracting the recombination contribution from the in-
tensity of [N ii] λ 5755 (Liu et al. 2004). We repeated our
calculations for this PN using [N iii] 57µm to estimate the
N++ abundance with the transition probabilities of Galavis
et al. (1998) and the collision strengths of Blum & Pradhan
(1992). Some of the new distributions of physical conditions
and ionic and total abundances for NGC 7662 are unaﬀected,
some others are displaced to lower values by up to 0.06 dex.
The widths of the aﬀected distributions are also smaller,
but by less than 0.01 dex. We conclude that the corrections
to Te[N ii] from recombination eﬀects would not change our
results in any signiﬁcant way and we ignore them in what
follows.

4.2 Ionic and total abundances

[O ii] λ λ 3726 + 29,

We determine the ionic abundances of O+, O++, N+, Cl++,
Ar++, Ar+3, Ne++, S+, and S++ using the brightest col-
lisionally excited lines that can be observed in the op-
[O iii] λ 4959 (we do not
tical range:
use [O iii] λ 5007 because in some objects it was satu-
rated), [N ii] λ λ 6548 + 83, [Cl iii] λ λ 5518 + 38, [Ar iii] λ 7136,
[Ar iv] λ λ 4711 + 40, [Ne iii] λ λ 3869, 3968, [S ii] λ λ 6716 +
31, and [S iii] λ 6312. The ionic abundances of He+ and
He++ have been estimated using the recombination lines
He i λ 6678 and He ii λ 4686.

The total abundances of oxygen, chlorine, argon, neon,
and sulphur are obtained using the ionization correction
factors (ICFs) calculated by Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014),
which are based on a large grid of photoionization models.
Although these ICFs were calculated for PNe, they can also
be applied to H ii regions (Delgado-Inglada et al. 2015). The
ICF for oxygen depends on the ratio He++/(He+ + He++).
For the other elements, the ICFs are based on the values
derived for O++/(O+ + O++).

For nitrogen we use the classical ICF based on the sim-
ilarity of the ionization potentials of N+ and O+, N/O =
N+/O+, since it seems to be working better than the one
proposed by Delgado-Inglada et al. (2014) for this element
(see Delgado-Inglada et al. 2015).

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

As a result of the procedure described above, we obtain for
each object a distribution of 50,000 values for all the pa-
rameters that we are calculating: ne[S ii], ne[O ii], ne[Cl iii],
ne[Ar iv], the average of the previous values (cid:104)ne(cid:105), Te[N ii],
Te[O iii], and the ionic and total abundances of O, N, Cl,
Ar, Ne, and S. The distributions we ﬁnd for the physical
conditions and element abundances have irregular shapes
and can reach extreme values, as shown below. The deter-
mination of the average value in these kinds of distributions
will be aﬀected in a disproportionate way by a few extreme
values. However, in these cases one can use the median of the
distribution as a more robust estimate of the central value.
On the other hand, irregular distribution shapes are not well
described by parameters like the standard deviation. There-
fore, we use the medians and total widths to characterize the
distributions. These quantities are listed in Tables 2, 3, and
4 for all the objects in the sample. The results for the abun-
dance ratios relative to oxygen are shown in Table 5. Note
that the distributions often do not sample in a continuous
way the full range identiﬁed in the tables.

We show in Figs. 2–9 the shapes of these distributions
for two objects, the high-density PN NGC 6572 and the
low-density H ii region 30 Doradus. We use in the plots nor-
malized histograms with bin sizes of 0.05 dex in density, 0.01
dex in temperature, and 0.02 dex in the ionic and total abun-
dances. These bin sizes are smaller than the observational
uncertainties typically reported for these quantities, which
result from the propagation of the errors associated to the
measurement of the line intensity ratios.

The vertical lines in Figs. 2–9 identify the results ob-
tained when only one set of atomic data is changed in the
dataset used by default in pyneb. The numbers are those
listed in Table 1. When these single changes of atomic data
do not aﬀect a particular result, their lines are located at the
position corresponding to the default calculations, which are
identiﬁed with the letter R. These results and the trends we
ﬁnd for the full sample of objects are discussed below.

Table 2, show that in many objects the four density diag-
nostics are in broad agreement. However, an inspection of
Table 2 shows that some nebulae might have density gradi-
ents or density ﬂuctuations. For example, in Cn 2-1, He 2-
118, and NGC 3576, most values of ne[Cl iii] and ne[Ar iv]
are higher than those of ne[S ii] and ne[O ii], whereas M 3-32
shows the opposite behaviour. Establishing whether these
variations are real or not will require more investigation,
since they could be an artefact introduced by unreliable
atomic data or by errors in the line intensity ratios. In the ab-
sence of more information, we use the average density from

the available diagnostics in our calculations for all the ob-
jects in the sample.

5.1.2 Atomic data that lead to divergent results

Three sets of atomic data lead to extreme values of density
that do not agree in the majority of objects with most of
the other density results: the transition probabilities calcu-
lated by Tayal & Zatsarinny (2010) for S+, the transition
probabilities of Wiese et al. (1996) for O+, and the collision
strengths of Mendoza (1983) for Ar+3.

the number 17 in Table 1 cannot reproduce the observed
values of the [S ii] λ 6716/λ 6731 intensity ratio in most
of the high-density objects. This dataset uses the default
atomic data (Podobedova et al. 2009) but includes the
transition probabilities of Tayal & Zatsarinny (2010) for
some transitions, in particular [S ii] λ λ 6716, 6731. The data
calculated by Tayal & Zatsarinny (2010) imply that the
[S ii] λ 6716/λ 6731 intensity ratio reaches at high densities
the value 0.503 (for Te = 104 K), which is higher than the

limiting values implied by the other datasets. Hence, as pre-
viously reported by Stasi´nska et al. (2013), this dataset fails
for nebulae with lower observed values for this ratio: He 2-
86, IC 418, NGC 6572, M 1-61, M 3-21, and Pe 1-1, all of
them with high density. In M 1-20, where this ratio has an
observed value of 0.504, these transition probabilities lead
to very high values of ne[S ii] (see Table 2). These extreme
densities introduce large uncertainties in all the calculations,
and the object does not appear in some of the ﬁgures pre-
sented below because it falls outside the plotted ranges. Note
that in the case of NGC 6572, where these atomic data fail to
produce a value for ne[S ii], line 17 is missing in the top panel
of Fig. 2 showing the distribution of values of ne[S ii], but ap-
pears in some of the panels of Figs. 4, 6, and 8, showing the
results obtained when the other three density diagnostics
are used to derive the average density.

In the case of ne[O ii], for most of our sample objects the
transition probabilities of Wiese et al. (1996) lead to densi-
ties that are lower than those implied by the other atomic
datasets for this ion and for the other diagnostics, in partic-
ular ne[S ii], which is expected to sample similar regions in
the nebula. The density results for NGC 6572 in Fig. 2 are
a good example of this behaviour: the values of ne[O ii] im-
plied by the transition probabilities of Wiese et al. (1996),
which correspond to the position of line 6 and the results
around this line in the second panel of this ﬁgure, are much
lower than all the other density results. Previous reports of
problems with this dataset were given by Copetti & Writzl
(2002).

On the other hand, the collision strengths of Mendoza
(1983) for Ar+3 show a similar but opposite behaviour for
ne[Ar iv]: these collision strengths, which are identiﬁed by
line 33 and the surrounding results in Figs. 2 and 3, lead to
densities that are generally much higher than those implied
by the other diagnostics.

The density jumps implied by these three sets of data
seem unlikely so that it is plausible to think that there
are problems with them. As we show below, the density
spreads introduced by the diﬀerent atomic data introduce
important uncertainties in the derived chemical abundances,
and these three atomic datasets introduce the greatest vari-
ations. Hence, we have repeated our calculations exclud-
ing these atomic datasets. We also exclude the collision
strengths of Palay et al. (2012) for O++ since they lead
to systematically lower temperatures of Te[O iii] in all the
objects (see Figs. 4 and 5), and the results could not be
reproduced by Storey et al. (2014), who performed similar
calculations.

5.1.3 The density spreads as a function of density

Fig. 10 shows the total widths of the density distributions
of ne[S ii], ne[O ii], ne[Cl iii], and ne[Ar iv] for all the objects,
plotted as a function of the median of the distribution of
the averages of the previous values, (cid:104)ne(cid:105) (shown in the 6th
column of Table 2). The distributions that we are ﬁnding do
not resemble the Gaussian distribution in most cases but the
full widths are representative of the uncertainties involved
in the calculations. Dark symbols show the results implied
by all the 52 atomic datasets; the light symbols show the
results obtained when we exclude the four datasets that lead
to discordant values of density or temperature.

The distributions of ne[S ii], ne[O ii], and ne[Cl iii] in
the sample objects have nearly constant widths up to ne ∼
2000 cm−3, as shown in Fig. 10. Beyond this density, the
widths of these distributions generally increase. On the other
hand, the width of the ne[Ar iv] distribution remains nearly
constant at all densities, in contrast to the behaviour shown
by the other diagnostics. Note also that the two H ii regions
where ne[Ar iv] is not available, M16 and M20, have less
variations in (cid:104)ne(cid:105) because they do not have the large dif-
ferences introduced by this diagnostic. Another noticeable
feature in Fig. 10 is that for densities above 104 cm−3, the
spread in ne[S ii] decreases due to the fact that Tayal & Zat-
sarinny (2010) cannot reproduce some of the observed values

of the λ 6716/λ 6731 intensity ratio, as mentioned above, and
hence stops contributing in full to this density distribution
spread. A comparison between the results shown with dark
and light symbols in Fig. 10 shows the signiﬁcant reduction
in the widths of the distributions attained by the exclusion
of just 4 of the 52 atomic datasets.

5.1.4 Dependence of the diagnostics on atomic data

The behaviour of the four density diagnostics as a func-
tion of density can be understood in terms of their density-
dependent sensitivity to changes in the atomic data involved

where ω2 and ω3 are the statistical weights of levels 2 and
3, and ϒ13/ϒ12 = ω3/ω2, since levels 2 and 3 belong to the
same term (this is a good approximation for low-lying states,
where relativistic eﬀects are usually negligible). The critical
densities for levels 2 and 3, nc(2) and nc(3), are the densities
at which radiative and collisional transitions are equally im-
portant for depopulating these levels. Critical densities can
be calculated with the expression:

in the calculations. The four ions used as density diagnos-
tics have the same ground electron conﬁguration and thus
the same level structure. As the four diagnostics are based on
transitions from levels 2 and 3 to the ground level, we can il-
lustrate their dependence on atomic data using a three-level
approximation. We have solved analytically the equations of
statistical equilibrium for these three levels assuming that
level 1 is signiﬁcantly more populated than levels 2 and 3.
This is a good approximation for these ions, since they keep
the population of these upper levels below or around 10 per
cent for densities lower than 105 cm−3. Levels 2 and 3 have
very similar energies and we have also considered negligible
their energy diﬀerence. Besides, an inspection of the tran-
sition probabilities implies that radiative transitions from
level 3 to level 2 are not important and can be neglected.

with nc(2) = A21/(q21 + q23) and nc(3) = (A31 + A32)/(q31 +
q32) for a three-level ion, where qi j is the collisional transition
j per ion in level i per colliding
rate from level i to level
electron per unit volume and per unit time. The value of qi j
is proportional to the collision strength of the transition, ϒi j,
and inversely proportional to the square root of the electron
temperature (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).

At densities much lower than the critical density of an
energy level, the population of this level tends to zero; at
much higher densities the level tends to the Boltzmann pop-
ulation. Table 6 lists the critical densities for all the upper
levels of the transitions that we are using in our calculations.
We supply in this table the values for Te = 104 K derived with
the default atomic datasets, and the range of values implied
by all the combinations of atomic data for each ion. Besides
their dependence on Te, the critical densities depend on the
atomic data used in their calculation, but an inspection of
Table 6 shows that in most cases the values calculated with
diﬀerent atomic data are in broad agreement. Therefore, the
values implied by the default dataset can be used as crude
estimates of the density regions where the level populations
of each ion start to be more sensitive to collisional eﬀects
and hence to density.

Equation 1 can be used to illustrate the behaviour of
the density diagnostics as a function of the critical densities
of the diagnostic lines. When ne << nc, the line intensity ra-

14

tio tends to (λ21/λ31)(ω3/ω2); at ne ∼ nc, the ratio depends
strongly on density and on the relative values of the radiative
and collisional atomic data, especially on the ratio A31/A21;
and when ne >> nc, it tends to (λ21/λ31)(ω3/ω2)(A31/A21).
Therefore, the density distributions of the four diagnostics
increase their widths at ne >
∼ nc because of their growing sen-
sitivity to changes in the values of A31/A21 implied by diﬀer-
ent atomic data. The [Ar iv] diagnostic lines have the highest
values of nc and the width of the ne[Ar iv] distributions only
increases near our high density limit.

On the other hand, the large range of values of nc for
Ar3+ listed in Table 6 and the comparison between atomic
datasets in Fig. 1 show the important diﬀerences and hence
uncertainties in the atomic data for this ion. The large width
of ∼ 0.7 dex displayed by the ne[Ar iv] distribution at all
densities is mostly due to the small value found by Men-
doza (1983) for the collision strength between levels 2 and
3, which implies ϒ13/ϒ23 = 0.63 for Te = 104 K. This ratio
is very diﬀerent from those derived by Ramsbottom & Bell
(1997) and Zeippen et al. (1987), ϒ13/ϒ23 = 0.16 and 0.32, re-
spectively. Because of this diﬀerence, the collision strengths
of Mendoza (1983) lead to very high densities in all the ob-
jects (see the values identiﬁed by line 33 in Figs. 2 and 3).
The approximations used to derive Equation 1 are only
good at a level of ∼ 10 per cent and cannot explain the rise
in the width of the ne[Ar iv] distribution at low densities.
Levels 4 and 5 of the ions used as density diagnostics, which
belong to the same spectral term, are collisionally excited
at all the densities that we are considering, and radiative
transitions from these levels help populate levels 2 and 3
with contributions of a few per cent. This implies that the
line intensity ratios do not reach the value (λ21/λ31)(ω3/ω2)
at low densities but have slightly diﬀerent values depending
on the atomic data. Test calculations with the statistical
equilibrium equations for 5-level ions show that the large
diﬀerences in ne[Ar iv] at ne (cid:39) 400 cm−3 arise from the low
value of ϒ14 and ϒ15 derived by Zeippen et al. (1987), which
implies ϒ15/ϒ13 = 0.15 for Te = 104 K, when Mendoza (1983)
and Ramsbottom & Bell (1997) ﬁnd ϒ15/ϒ13 = 0.50 and 0.69,
respectively.

5.1.5 The inﬂuence of other atomic data

Part of the spread in the density distributions must arise
from the atomic data used to calculate electron temperature.
We have constrained this eﬀect by ﬁxing the temperatures
to the values obtained when using the default combination
of atomic data for all ions and repeating the caculations of
electron densities. We ﬁnd that the spread decreases but not
by a large amount. The remaining spread goes up to 1.2 dex
in ne[O ii], 0.8 dex in ne[Cl iii], and 0.6 dex in ne[S ii] and
in the average density. The spread of ne[Ar iv] is not much
aﬀected.

5.1.6 Final comments on density

The spreads of the density distributions for ne[S ii], ne[O ii],
ne[Cl iii], and ne[Ar iv] in all the objects produce the spreads
in the distributions of average densities shown in the lower
panel of Fig. 10. The average densities are used in the cal-
culation of electron temperatures and ionic abundances and

the large spreads introduce important uncertainties in these
quantities, as we show below. Note that the use of a single
density diagnostic would not reduce in a signiﬁcant way the
density uncertainties and would increase the eﬀect of ob-
servational errors. On the other hand, although our interest
here was to explore the behaviour of the four diagnostics
in the full density range covered by the objects, one should
always consider the sensitivity of the diagnostics to density,
avoiding, whenever it is possible, the use of the [Cl iii] and
[Ar iv] diagnostics at low density, and the [S ii] and [O ii]
diagnostics at high density.

5.2 Temperatures

The distributions of values of Te[N ii] and Te[O iii]
for
NGC 6572 and 30 Doradus are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Fig. 5
shows that at low densities both temperatures show narrow
distributions, with diﬀerences lower than 10 per cent, which
are mainly introduced by the atomic data of the correspond-
ing ions: an inspection of Table 1 shows that lines 1, 3, and
4 in the upper panel of Fig. 5 identify changes of sets of N+
atomic data in the default combination, whereas lines 11–14
in the lower panel all correspond to changes in datasets for
O++. Most of the spread in the values of Te[O iii] is intro-
duced by the collision strengths of Palay et al. (2012), that
lead to systematically lower temperatures in all objects as
commented before.

A comparison with the results for NGC 6572 in Fig. 4
shows that at higher densities the uncertainties introduced
by the atomic data used in the diagnostic of density start
playing a part in the spread of temperature. In the case
of Te[O iii], the eﬀect is small and besides lines 11–14, only
line 33, corresponding to the collision strengths of Mendoza
(1983) for Ar3+, departs signiﬁcantly from the results of the
default combination of atomic data. However, the values cal-
culated for Te[N ii] have a stronger dependence on density
(note that the values of nc in Table 6 are lower for this ion),
and the distributions of values for this quantity have a much
larger spread. These trends can be seen in Fig. 11, where the
widths of the Te[N ii] and Te[O iii] distributions are plotted
as a function of the median of the average densities for each
object. This ﬁgure shows that the spreads in density create
uncertainties in temperature that can reach 20 per cent in
Te[O iii] and nearly a factor of 2 in Te[N ii]. These uncertain-
ties are reduced to 7 per cent in Te[O iii] and 60 per cent in
Te[N ii] when the three datasets that lead to discordant den-
sities and the collision strengths of Palay et al. (2012) are
excluded from the calculations (see the light/orange symbols
in Fig. 11).

The spread introduced solely by the atomic data used
for the temperature determinations can be obtained by re-
peating the calculations keeping ﬁxed the density of each
object to the value obtained using the default combination
of atomic data. In this way we ﬁnd that the O++ atomic
data create uncertainties smaller than 0.03 dex in Te[O iii]
at all densities, whereas the N+ data create even smaller un-
certainties for Te[N ii] at low density, that only increase up
to 0.04 dex at the highest densities.

cally, with some ions, like S+ and O+, reaching uncertainties
of a factor of 5 at ne = 104 cm−3, which continue to increase
at higher densities, reaching factors of 60 and 200, respec-
tively, at ne (cid:39) 5 × 104 cm−3. For other ions, like O++, Ne++,
S++, and Ar++, the uncertainties are lower, only approach-
ing factors of 2 at the highest densities. The light/orange
symbols in Fig. 12 show that the uncertainties are much
lower when the four datasets discussed in Section 5.1 are
excluded, although they still reach factors ∼ 25 for O+ at
high density.

The behaviour of the uncertainties in the ionic abun-
dances is the result of three causes. The ﬁrst and main cause
is the uncertainty or spread in density, which increases at
higher densities. This spread aﬀects mainly those ionic abun-
dances based on lines whose upper levels have low critical
densities, that is O+ and S+, followed by Cl++, since their
emissivities are very sensitive to changes in density. The sec-
ond cause is the spread in temperature introduced by the
spread in density, which is more important for Te[N ii] and
hence aﬀects mostly those ionic abundances where this tem-
perature is used for the calculations: O+, S+, and N+. The
spreads in ionic abundances introduced by Te[O iii] for the
other ions are smaller and due to changes in all the atomic
data for O++. The third and least important cause of the
spreads in the ionic abundances shown in Fig. 12 is the un-
certainties arising from the use of diﬀerent atomic data for
each ion, independently of the uncertainties that they might
introduce in the calculation of the physical conditions. We
have checked for the eﬀect of this third source of uncer-
tainty by calculating the abundance spreads when the phys-
ical conditions are ﬁxed to the values implied by the default
datasets. We ﬁnd that in this case the spread in ionic abun-
dances remains below or around 0.1 dex for all ions except
Ar3+, that reaches spreads of a factor of two because of the
large diﬀerences in its available atomic data.

5.4 Total abundances

The total abundances are based on the ionic abundances
of O+, O++, N+, Cl++, Ar++, Ne++, S+, and S++ along
with ICFs that depend on He++/(He+ + He++) for oxygen
and on O++/(O+ + O++) for the other elements (Delgado-
Inglada et al. 2014). Note that the ICF for argon is based
on the Ar++ so that the argon total abundances do not re-
ﬂect the uncertainties introduced by the atomic data in the
Ar+3 abundance. The resulting distributions for NGC 6572
and 30 Doradus are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, whereas Fig. 13
shows the widths of the distributions as a function of den-
sity. Since the procedure used to derive total abundances de-
pends on the degree of ionization of each object, the widths
of the distributions have a larger dispersion for a given den-
sity than the ionic abundances, but the ﬁgures show that
the uncertainties introduced by atomic data remain low, be-
low or around 0.2 dex, at low densities, ne <
∼ 103 cm−3, but
increase to factors of 2–3 at ne ∼ 104 cm−3, reaching factors
of 4–6 at the highest densities. At a given density, the un-
certainties in O/H, Ne/H, Cl/H, and Ar/H are larger for
objects with higher values of O+/O; but N/H and S/H are
less uncertain when O+/O is higher.

Total abundances are often presented with respect to
the oxygen abundance, and Fig.14 shows the uncertainties

sample objects plotted against the medians of the distributions

plied by all the available 52 datasets; the light (orange) symbols
show the results when we exclude the four datasets that lead to
discordant values of density or temperature. A color version of
this plot is available in the online article.

5.3 Ionic abundances

All the ionic abundances have been calculated using the av-
erage density obtained from the four density diagnostics.
The abundances of O++, Cl++, Ar++, Ar+3, Ne++, and S++
are also based on the values of Te[O iii]; whereas the calcula-
tions of the abundances of O+, N+, and S+ use the values of
Te[N ii]. Figs. 6 and 7 show the distributions of ionic abun-
dances for NGC 6572 and 30 Doradus implied by the diﬀer-
ent combinations of atomic data. Since the ionic abundances
are calculated using the previous results for the electron den-
sity and electron temperature, these ﬁgures illustrate the
complex interplay between all the atomic data involved in
the calculations. For example, note the distributions of the
O+, N+, and S+ abundances for NGC 6572 in Fig. 6. The
vertical lines in the ﬁgure, which identify the abundances
obtained using the default combination of atomic data (line
R) and those obtained when a single dataset is changed in
this combination (lines 1–34, see Table 1), show how all these
ionic abundances depend on the atomic data used for O+,
N+, S+, Cl++, and Ar3+, the ions used in the derivation
of physical conditions. The spreads shown by these distri-
butions also illustrate the large uncertainties introduced by
atomic data at high density.

Fig. 12 shows the widths of the distributions of ionic
abundances for all the objects, plotted against the median
of their average densities. It can be seen in Fig. 12 that
the uncertainties introduced by the choice of atomic data
at low densities are small, around 0.1 dex, for most ions.
One exception is the S++ abundance, whose spread reaches
∼ 0.2 dex at low densities because of the high sensitivity
of the [S iii] λ 6312 line to small changes in Te. The second
and main exception is the Ar3+ abundance, with a total
width of ∼ 0.5 dex in most objects, which is due to the large
diﬀerences in the available atomic data for this ion.

As the density increases the situation changes drasti-

introduced by atomic data on these relative abundances. The
uncertainties are especially important for N/O and Ar/O:
for these abundance ratios they reach a spread of one order
of magnitude at the highest densities we are considering. In
fact, for N/O, Ar/O, and also S/O, the uncertainties are
larger than for N/H, Ar/H, and S/H, respectively. For neon
we have the opposite behaviour, much larger uncertainties
for Ne/H than for Ne/O, whereas for chlorine the values
of Cl/H only have slightly larger uncertainties than those
for Cl/O. At a given density, the uncertainties in all the
abundances relative to oxygen are larger for objects with
higher values of O+/O.

6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have explored the uncertainties introduced by diﬀerent
atomic data in nebular abundance determinations. We have
used high-quality spectra of 36 PNe and eight H ii regions
taken from the literature to compute in a homogeneous way
the physical conditions, ne[S ii], ne[O ii], ne[Cl iii], ne[Ar iv],
Te[N ii], and Te[O iii], the ionic abundances of O+, O++, N+,
Cl++, Ar++, Ar3+, Ne++, S+, and S++, and the total abun-
dances of the corresponding elements using the compilation
of atomic data in pyneb (Luridiana et al. 2015). We have
sampled all the possible combinations of atomic data and
measured the widths of the distributions of values obtained
for each quantity.

We ﬁnd that the choice of atomic data can have a
large impact on the derived physical conditions and chem-
ical abundances. As shown in Fig. 10, the diﬀerent atomic
data lead to variations of 0.2 to 0.3 dex in ne[S ii], ne[O ii],
and ne[Cl iii] at low densities. However, the variations in-
crease with density and can reach one order of magnitude at
ne ≥ 104 cm−3. The values of ne[Ar iv] vary by ∼ 0.8 dex at all
densities. The diﬀerences in the values calculated for Te[O iii]
and Te[N ii] increase with average density (see Fig. 11), go-
ing from a few per cent at low densities, to 20 per cent
for Te[O iii] and nearly a factor of 2 for Te[N ii] at densities
∼ 104.7 cm−3.

The eﬀect of the diﬀerent atomic datasets in the derived
ionic and total abundances also increases with density, with
variations below or around 0.2 dex at ne ≤ 103 cm−3, around
0.2 to 0.4 dex at 103 cm−3 ≤ ne ≤ 104 cm−3, and around or
above 0.4–0.6 dex at ne ≥ 104 cm−3 for most elements (see
Figs. 12 to 14). The values of N/O are especially sensitive to
changes in atomic data, with variations that reach one order
of magnitude at high density.

Four of the atomic datasets lead to discordant values
of density and temperature: the transition probabilities of
Tayal & Zatsarinny (2010) for S+, the transition probabil-
ities of Wiese et al. (1996) for O+, the collision strengths
of Mendoza (1983) for Ar+3, and the collision strengths of
Palay et al. (2012) for O++. The datasets for S+, O+, and
Ar+3 imply densities that do not agree with those implied by
the other datasets available for the same diagnostic and that
diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the densities inferred from the other
density diagnostics in most objects. Besides, the transition
probabilities of Tayal & Zatsarinny (2010) cannot reproduce
the values of the [S ii] diagnostic in six of our high-density
objects. As for the O++ collision strengths of Palay et al.
(2012), they lead to temperatures that are always lower than

those implied by the other O++ datasets. This does not
necessarily imply that these collision strengths are faulty,
but Storey et al. (2014) could not reproduce the results of
Palay et al. (2012). Hence, we repeated all the calculations of
physical conditions and ionic and total abundances exclud-
ing these four datasets. The remaining 48 datasets imply
uncertainties that are signiﬁcantly lower, with abundance
ratios that diﬀer in less than 0.2–0.3 dex in most objects,
although some high-density nebulae still reach uncertainties
of 0.4 dex in S/O, 0.5 dex in Ne/H, and 0.6 dex in O/H and
N/O.

Most of the uncertainties introduced by atomic data
in the determination of chemical abundances arise from the
density diﬀerences found at high density. We have illustrated
the dependence of the density diagnostics on atomic data
using a three-level approximation (eq. 1). This allows us to
identify the atomic data that have the largest impact on
the results, namely, the transition probabilities of the [S ii],
[O ii], [Cl iii], and [Ar iv] lines used in the density diagnos-
tics, and the collision strengths for Ar3+. Improved deter-
minations of these atomic data will reduce the signiﬁcant
impact that atomic data have on the chemical abundances
derived for high-density objects. The data for Cl++ and Ar3+
are especially critical, since these are the ions whose diag-
nostics work better at high density. In the meantime, our
results can be used to estimate the systematic uncertainties
introduced by atomic data for any PN or H ii region whose
density is known.
