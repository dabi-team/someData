Abstract. In this paper we continue the study of triangular matrix categories
Λ =
initiated in [21]. First, given an additive category C and an ideal
IB in C, we prove a well known result that there is a canonical recollement
Mod(C/IB)
Mod(B)
. We show that given a recolle-
ment between functor categories we can induce a new recollement between
triangular matrix categories, this is a generalization of a result given by Chen
and Zheng in [11, theorem 4.4]. In the case of dualizing K-varieties we can
restrict the recollement we obtained to the categories of ﬁnitely presented func-
tors. Given a dualizing variety C, we describe the maps category of mod(C) as
modules over a triangular matrix category and we study its Auslander-Reiten
sequences and contravariantly ﬁnite subcategories, in particular we generalize
several results from [24]. Finally, we prove a generalization of a result due
to Smalø ([35, Theorem 2.1]), which give us a way of construct functorially
M U (cid:3) (cid:17) from those of Mod(T ) and
ﬁnite subcategories in the category Mod(cid:16) (cid:2)
Mod(U ).

1. Introduction

A recollement of abelian categories is an exact sequence of abelian categories
where both the inclusion and the quotient functors admit left and right adjoints.
Recollements ﬁrst appeared in the context of triangulated categories in the construc-
tion of the category of perverse sheaves on a singular space by Beilinson, Bernstein
and Deligne (see [10]); they were trying to axiomatize the Grothendieck’s six func-
tors for derived categories of sheaves. In representation theory, recollements were
used by Cline, Parshall and Scott to study module categories of ﬁnite dimensional
algebras over a ﬁeld (see [27]). They appear in connection with quasi-hereditary
algebras and highest weight categories. Recollements of triangulated categories also
have appeared in the work of Angeleri-H¨ugel, Koenig and Liu in connection with
tilting theory and homological conjectures of derived categories of rings (see [1], [2]
and [3]).
In the context of abelian categories, recollements were studied by Franjou and Pi-
rashvili in [14], motivated by the work of MacPherson-Vilonen in derived category
of perverse sheaves (see [23]). Several homological properties of recollements of
abelian categories have been amply studied (see [29], [30], [31], [34]).
It should be noted that recollements of abelian categories appear naturally in var-
ious settings in representation theory. For example any idempotent element e in
a ring R with unit induces a canonical recollement between the module categories
over the rings R, R/ReR and eRe. In fact, in [30], Psaroudakis and Vitoria, studied
recollements of module categories and they showed that a recollement whose terms

are module categories is equivalent to one induced by an idempoten element.
In the context of comma categories we point out that Chen and Zhen, studied
conditions under which a recollement relative to abelian categories induces a new
recollement relative to abelian categories and comma categories and they applied
their results to deduce results about recollements in categories of modules over tri-
angular matrices rings (see [11]).
On the other hand, rings of the form [ T 0
M U ] where T and U are rings and M is
a T -U -bimodule have appeared often in the study of the representation theory of
artin rings and algebras (see for example [7],[12], [15], [16], [17]). Such a rings
appear naturally in the study of homomorphic images of hereditary artin algebras.
These types of algebras have been amply studied. For example, Zhu considered the
triangular matrix algebra Λ := [ T 0
M U ] where T and U are quasi-hereditary algebras
and he proved that under suitable conditions on M , Λ is quasi-hereditary algebra
(see [37]). In the paper [36], the triangular matrix algebra of rank two was extended
to the one of rank n and obtained that there is a relation between the morphism
category and the module category of the corresponding matrix algebra.
Also, in this direction let us recall the following result due to Smalø: Let T and U
M U ] and denote by mod(Λ)X
be artin algebras, consider the matrix algebra Λ := [ T 0
Y
the full subcategory of mod(Λ) whose objects are U -morphisms f : M ⊗T A −→ B
with A ∈ X and B ∈ Y where X ⊆ mod(T ) and Y ⊆ mod(U ) are subcategories.
Then, mod(Λ)X
Y is functorially ﬁnite in mod(Λ) if and only if X and Y are functo-
rially ﬁnite in mod(T ) and mod(U ) respectively (see [35, Theorem 2.1]).
In the paper [21], given two additive categories U and T and M ∈ Mod(U ⊗ T op)
we constructed the matrix category Λ := [ T 0
M U ] and we studied several of its
properties. In particular we proved that there exists and equivalence of categories
Mod(T ), GMod(U)
≃ Mod(Λ). In this paper, one of the main results is a gen-
(cid:17)
(cid:16)
eralization of the result in [11, theorem 4.4], that given a recollement between
functor categories we can induce a recollement between modules over certain trian-
gular matrix categories Mod
. We also show that in the case of dualizing
K-varieties we can restric that recollement to the category of ﬁnitely presented
modules mod(Λ) (see 4.1 and 4.12). Finally, we prove an analogous of the Smalø’s
result mentioned above, but for the context of dualizing varieties (see Theorem 8.3).
We now give a brief description of the contents on this paper.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Categorical Foundations and Notations. We recall that a category C to-
gether with an abelian group structure on each of the sets of morphisms C(C1, C2)
is called preadditive category provided all the composition maps C(C, C′) ×
C(C′, C′′) −→ C(C, C′′) in C are bilinear maps of abelian groups. A covariant func-
tor F : C1 −→ C2 between preadditive categories C1 and C2 is said to be additive if
for each pair of objects C and C′ in C1, the map F : C1(C, C′) −→ C2(F (C), F (C′))
is a morphism of abelian groups. Let C and D be preadditive categories and Ab
the category of abelian groups. A functor F : C × D → Ab is called biaddi-
tive if F : C(C, C′) × D(D, D′) → Ab(F (C, D), F (C′, D′)) is bi additive, that is,
F (f + f ′, g) = F (f, g) + F (f ′, g) and F (f, g + g′) = F (f, g) + F (f, g′).
If C is a preadditive category we always considerer its opposite category Cop as a
preadditive category by letting Cop(C′, C) = C(C, C′). We follow the usual conven-
tion of identifying each contravariant functor F from a category C to D with the
covariant functor F from Cop to D.

2.2. The category Mod(C). Throughout this section C will be an arbitrary skele-
tally small preadditive category, and Mod(C) will denote the category of covariant
functors from C to the category of abelian groups Ab, called the category of C-
modules. This category has as objects the functors from C to Ab, and and a
morphism f : M1 −→ M2 of C-modules is a natural transformation, that is, the
set of morphisms HomC(M1, M2) from M1 to M2 is given by Nat(M1, M2). We
sometimes we will write for short, C(−, ?) instead of HomC(−, ?) and when it is
clear from the context we will use just (−, ?).
We now recall some of properties of the category Mod(C), for more details consult
[5]. The category Mod(C) is an abelian with the following properties:

(3) For each C in C, the C-module (C, −) given by (C, −)(X) = C(C, X)
for each X in C, has the property that for each C-module M , the map
((C, −), M ) −→ M (C) given by f 7→ fC(1C ) for each C-morphism f :
(C, −) −→ M is an isomorphism of abelian groups. We will often consider
this isomorphism an identiﬁcation. Hence
(a) The functor P : C −→ Mod(C) given by P (C) = (C, −) is fully faithful.
P (Ci) is a

projective C-module.

(c) Given a C-module M , there is a family {Ci}i∈I of objects in C such

that there is an epimorphism ∐
i∈I

P (Ci) −→ M −→ 0.

2.3. Change of Categories. The results that appears in this subsection are di-
rectly taken from [5]. Let C be a skeletally small category. There is a unique (up to
isomorphism) functor ⊗C : Mod(Cop) × Mod(C) −→ Ab called the tensor prod-
uct. The abelian group ⊗C(A, B) is denoted by A ⊗C B for all Cop-modules A and
all C-modules B.

Proposition 2.1. The tensor product has the following properties:

(1)

(a) For each C-module B, the functor ⊗CB : Mod(Cop) −→ Ab given by

(⊗CB)(A) = A ⊗C B for all Cop-modules A is right exact.

(b) For each Cop-module A, the functor A⊗C : Mod(C) −→ Ab given by

(A⊗C)(B) = A ⊗C B for all C-modules B is right exact.

(2) For each Cop-module A and each C-module B, the functors A⊗C and ⊗CB

preserve arbitrary sums.

(3) For each object C in C we have A⊗C (C, −) = A(C) and (−, C)⊗CB = B(C)

for all Cop-modules A and all C-modules B.

Suppose now that C′ is a subcategory of the skeletally small category C. We use
the tensor product of C′-modules, to describe the left adjoint C⊗C′ of the restriction
functor resC′ : Mod(C) −→ Mod(C′).
Deﬁne the functor C⊗C′ : Mod (C′) −→ Mod (C) by (C ⊗C′ M ) (C) = (−, C) |C′
⊗C′M for all M ∈ Mod (C′) and C ∈ C. Using the properties of the tensor product
it is not diﬃcult to establish the following proposition.

Proposition 2.2. [5, Proposition 3.1] Let C′ a subcategory of the skeletally small
category C. Then the functor C⊗C′ : Mod (C′) −→ Mod (C) satisﬁes:

(1) C⊗C′ is right exact and preserves sums;

(2) The composition Mod (C′)

C⊗C′
−→ Mod (C)

resC′
−→ Mod (C′) is the identity on

Mod (C′) ;

(3) For each object C′ ∈ C′, we have C ⊗C′ C′ (C′, −) = C (C′, −) ;
(4) For each C′-module M and each C-module N , the restriction map

C (C ⊗C′ M, N ) −→ C′ (M, N |C′ )

is an isomorphism;

(5) C⊗C′ is a fully faithful functor;
(6) C⊗C′ preserves projective objects.

Having described the left adjoint C⊗C′ of the restriction functor resC′ : Mod (C) −→

Mod (C′) , we now describe its right adjoint.
Let C′ be a full subcategory of the category C. Deﬁne the functor C′ (C, −) :
Mod (C′) −→ Mod (C) by C′ (C, M ) (X) = C′ ((X, −) |C′, M ) for all C′-modules M
and all objects X in C. We have the following proposition.

Proposition 2.3. [5, Proposition 3.4] Let C′ a subcategory of the skeletally small
category C. Then the functor C′ (C, −) : Mod (C′) −→ Mod (C) has the following
properties:

(1) C′ (C, −) is left exact and preserves inverse limits;
(2) The composition Mod (C′)

−→ Mod (C)

C′(C,−)

resC′
−→ Mod (C′) is the identity on

Mod (C′) ;

(3) For each C′-module M and C-module N , the restriction map

C (N, C′ (C, M )) −→ C′ (N |C′ , M )

is an isomorphism;

(4) C′ (C, −) is a fully faithful functor;
(5) C′ (C, −) preserves injective objects.

2.4. Dualizing varietes and Krull-Schmidt Categories. The subcategory of
Mod(C) consisting of all ﬁnitely generated projective objects, p(C), is a skeletally
small additive category in which idempotents split, the functor P : C → p(C),
P (C) = C(C, −), is fully faithful and induces by restriction res : Mod(p(C)) →
Mod(C), an equivalence of categories. For this reason, we may assume that our
categories are skeletally small, additive categories, such that idempotents split.
Such categories were called annuli varieties in [6], for short, varieties.
To ﬁx the notation, we recall known results on functors and categories that we use
through the paper, referring for the proofs to the papers by Auslander and Reiten
[4, 5, 6].

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let C be a variety. We say C has pseudokernels; if given a map
f : C1 → C0, there exists a map g : C2 → C1 such that the sequence of morphisms
C(−, C2)

(−,f )
−−−→ C(−, C0) is exact in Mod(Cop).

(−,g)
−−−→ C(−, C1)

Now, we recall some results from [6].

Deﬁnition 2.5. Let R be a commutative artin ring. An R-variety C, is a variety
such that C(C1, C2) is an R-module, and the composition is R-bilinear. An R-
variety C is Hom-ﬁnite, if for each pair of objects C1, C2 in C, the R-module
C(C1, C2) is ﬁnitely generated. We denote by (C, mod(R)), the full subcategory of
(C, Mod(R)) consisting of the C-modules such that; for every C in C the R-module
M (C) is ﬁnitely generated.

Suppose C is a Hom-ﬁnite R-variety. If M : C −→ Ab is a C-module, then for
each C ∈ C the abelian group M (C) has a structure of EndC(C)op-module and
hence as an R-module since EndC(C) is an R-algebra. Further if f : M −→ M ′

6

ALICIA LE ´ON-GALEANA, MART´IN ORTIZ-MORALES, VALENTE SANTIAGO VARGAS

is a morphism of C-modules it is easy to show that fC : M (C) −→ M ′(C) is a
morphism of R-modules for each C ∈ C. Then, Mod(C) is an R-variety, which
we identify with the category of covariant functors (C, Mod(R)). Moreover, the
category (C, mod(R)) is abelian and the inclusion (C, mod(R)) → (C, Mod(R)) is
exact.

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let C be a Hom-ﬁnite R-variety. We denote by mod(C) the full
subcategory of Mod(C) whose objects are the ﬁnitely presented functors. That
is, M ∈ mod(C) if and only if, there exists an exact sequence in Mod(C)

P1

/ P0

/ M

/ 0,

where P1 and P0 are ﬁnitely generated projective C-modules.

It is easy to see that if C has ﬁnite coproducts, then a functor M is ﬁnitely

presented if there exists an exact sequence

C(−, C1) → C(−, C0) → M → 0

It was proved in [6] that mod(C) is abelian if and only if C has pseudokernels.
Consider the functors DCop : (Cop, mod(R)) → (C, mod(R)), and DC : (C, mod(R)) →
(Cop, mod(R)), which are deﬁned as follows: for any object C in C, D(M )(C) =
HomR(M (C), I(R/r)), with r the Jacobson radical of R, and I(R/r) is the injec-
tive envelope of R/r. The functor DC deﬁnes a duality between (C, mod(R)) and
(Cop, mod(R)). We know that since C is Hom-ﬁnite, mod(C) is a subcategory of
(C, mod(R)). Then we have the following deﬁnition due to Auslander and Reiten
(see [6]).

Deﬁnition 2.7. An Hom-ﬁnite R-variety C is dualizing, if the functor

(1)

DC : (C, mod(R)) → (Cop, mod(R))

induces a duality between the categories mod(C) and mod(Cop).

It is clear from the deﬁnition that for dualizing categories C the category mod(C)

has enough injectives. To ﬁnish, we recall the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 2.8. An additive category C is Krull-Schmidt, if every object in C
decomposes in a ﬁnite sum of objects whose endomorphism ring is local.

Asumme that R is a commutative ring and R is a dualizing R-variety. Since the
endomorphism ring of each object in C is an artin algebra, it follows that C is a
Krull-Schmidt category [6, p.337], moreover, we have that for a dualizing variety
the ﬁnitely presented functors have projective covers [5, Cor. 4.13], [20, Cor. 4.4].
The following result appears in [6, Prop. 2.6]

Theorem 2.9. Let C a dualizing R-variety. Then mod(C) is a dualizing variety.

2.5. Tensor Product of Categories. If C and D are additive categories, B.
Mitchell deﬁned in [26] the tensor product C ⊗ D of two additive categories,
whose objects are those of C × D and the abelian group of morphism from (C, D)
to (C′, D′) is the ordinary tensor product of abelian groups C(C, C′) ⊗Z D(D, D′).
Since that the tensor product of abelian groups is associative and commutative and
the composition in C and D is Z-bilinear then the bilinear composition in C ⊗ D is
given as follows:

(f2 ⊗ g2) ◦ (f1 ⊗ g1) := (f2 ◦ f1) ⊗ (g2 ◦ g1)

for all f1 ⊗ g1 ∈ C(C, C′) ⊗ D(D, D′) and f2 ⊗ g2 ∈ C(C′, C′′) ⊗ D(D′, D′′).

2.6. The Path Category of a Quiver. A quiver ∆ consists of a set of vertices
∆0 and a set of arrows ∆1 which is the disjoint union of sets ∆(x, y) where the
elements of ∆(x, y) are the arrows α : x → y from the vertex x to the vertex y.
Given a quiver ∆ its path category Pth∆ has as objects the vertices of ∆ and
the morphisms x → y are paths from x to y which are by deﬁnition the formal
compositions αn · · · α1 where α1 stars in x, αn ends in y and the end point of αi
coincides with the start point of αi+1 for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1}. The positive integer
n is called the length of the path. There is a path ξx of length 0 for each vertex to
itself. The composition in Pth∆ of paths of positive length is just concatenations
whereas the ξx act as identities.

Given a quiver ∆ and a ﬁeld K, an additive K-category K∆ is associated to
∆ by taking as objects of K∆ the direct sum of indecomposable objects. The
indecomposable objects in K∆ are given by the vertices of ∆ and given x, y ∈ ∆0
the set of maps from x to y is given by the K-vector space with basis the set of
all paths from x to y. The composition in K∆ is of course obtained by K-linear
extension of the composition in Pth∆, that is, the product of two composable paths
is deﬁned to be the corresponding composition, the product of two non-composable
paths is, by deﬁnition, zero. In this way we obtain an associative K-algebra which

has unit element if and only if ∆0 is ﬁnite (the unit element is given by
In K∆, we denote by K∆+ the ideal generated by all arrows and by (K∆+)n the
ideal generated by all paths of length ≥ n.
w λww, λw ∈ K where w are
Given vertices x, y ∈ ∆0, a ﬁnite linear combination
paths of length ≥ 2 from x to y, is called a relation on ∆. It can be seen that any
ideal I ⊂ (K∆+)2 can be generated, as an ideal, by relations. If I is generated as
an ideal by the set {ρi|i} of relations, we write I = hρi|ii.
Given a quiver ∆ = (∆0, ∆1) a representation V = (Vx, fα) of ∆ over K is given
by vector spaces Vx for all x ∈ ∆0, and linear maps fα : Vx → Vy, for any arrow
α : x → y. The category of representations of ∆ is the category with objects the
representations, and a morphism of representations h = (hx) : V → V ′ is given
by maps hx : Vx → V ′
x (x ∈ ∆0) such that hyfα = f ′
αhx for any α : x → y. The
category of representations of ∆ y denoted by Rep(∆).
Given a set of relations hρi | ii of ∆, we denote by K∆/hρi|ii the path category
given by the quiver ∆ and relations ρi. The category of functors Mod(K∆/hρi|ii) =
(K∆/hρi|ii, Mod K) can be identiﬁed with the representations of ∆ satisfying the
relations ρi which is denoted by Rep(∆, {ρi|i}), (see [33, p. 42]).

2.7. Quotient category and the radical of a category. A two sided ideal
I(−, ?) is an additive subfunctor of the two variable functor C(−, ?) : Cop ⊗ C → Ab
such that: (a) if f ∈ I(X, Y ) and g ∈ C(Y, Z), then gf ∈ I(X, Z); and (b) if
f ∈ I(X, Y ) and h ∈ C(U, X), then f h ∈ I(U, Z). If I is a two-sided ideal, then
we can form the quotient category C/I whose objects are those of C, and where
(C/I)(X, Y ) := C(X, Y )/I(X, Y ). Finally the composition is induced by that of C
(see [26]). There is a canonical projection functor π : C → C/I such that:

(1) π(X) = X, for all X ∈ C.
(2) For all f ∈ C(X, Y ), π(f ) = f + I(X, Y ) := ¯f .
Based on the Jacobson radical of a ring, we introduce the radical of an additive

category. This concept goes back to work of Kelly (see [19]).

Deﬁnition 2.10. The (Jacobson) radical of an additive category C is the two-sided
ideal radC in C deﬁned by the formula

radC(X, Y ) = {h ∈ C(X, Y ) | 1X − gh is invertible for any g ∈ C(Y, X)}

for all objects X and Y of C.

2.8. Comma Categories. If A and B are abelian categories and F : A → B is
an additive functor. The comma category (B, F A) is the category whose objects
are triples (B, f, A) where f : B → F A; and whose morphisms between the objects
(B, f, A) and (B′, f ′, A′) are pair (β, α) of morphisms in B×A such that the diagram

β

B

f

B′

f ′

F α

F A

F A′

is commutative in B (see [13]).

3. Recollements in Functor Categories induced by an Auslander’s

triple adjoint

We recall some basic deﬁnitions. Consider functors F : C → D and G : D → C.
We say that F is left adjoint to G or that G is right adjoint to F , and that
(F, G) is an adjoint pair if there is a natural equivalence

η =

ηX,Y : ηX,Y : HomD(F X, Y ) → HomC(X, GY )

n

oX∈C,Y ∈D

between the functors HomD(F (−), −) and HomC(−, G(−)). For every X ∈ C and
Y ∈ D, we set ǫX := ηX,F X (1F X ) : X → GF X and δY := η−1
GY,Y (1GY ) : F GY → Y .
Moreover, ǫ = {ǫX}X∈C : 1C → GF and δ = {δY }Y ∈D : F G → 1D are natural
transformations.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let A, B and C be abelian categories

(a) The diagram

C

i∗

is a called a left recollement if the additive functors i∗, i∗, j! and j! satisfy
the following conditions:

(LR1) (i∗, i∗) and (j!, j!) are adjoint pairs;
(LR2) j!i∗ = 0;
(LR3) i∗, j! are full embedding functors.

(b) The diagram

C

i!

is called a right recollement if the additive functors i!, i!, j∗ and j∗ satisfy
the following conditions:

(RR1) (i!, i!) and (j∗, j∗) are adjoint pairs;
(RR2) j∗i! = 0;
(RR3) i!, j∗ are full embedding functors.

C

is called a recollement, if the additive functors i∗, i∗ = i!, i!, j!, j! = j∗ and j∗
satisfy the following conditions:

(R1) (i∗, i∗ = i!, i!) and (j!, j! = j∗, j∗) are adjoint triples, i.e. (i∗, i∗), (i!, i!)

(j!, j!) and (j∗, j∗) are adjoint pairs;

(R2) j∗i∗ = 0;
(R3) i∗, j!, j∗ are full embedding functors.

By the above deﬁnitions we see that a recollement can be seen as the gluing
of a left recollement and a right recollement, and if a left recollement and a right
recollement satisfy that i∗ = i! and j! = j∗ then they can be glued to form a
recollement.

Let C be an a additive category and B be a full additive subcategory of C. Maurice
Auslander introduced in [5] three functors such that, according with Propositions
2.2 and 2.3, together form an adjoint triple (C⊗B, resB, B(C, −))

(2)

Mod(C)

C⊗B

resB

B(C,−)

/ Mod(B)

In this subsection we show how to extend the adjoint triple (2) to a recollement
of functor categories. Similar results are given in [34], but we present them in a
slightly diﬀerent way.
Before deﬁning a new triple adjoint, we need some preparatory results. Let B a full
additive subcategory of C. For all pair of objects C, C′ ∈ C we denote by IB (C, C′)
the abelian subgroup of C (C, C′) whose elements are morphism f : C −→ C′ which
factor through B. It is not hard to see that under these conditions IB (−, ?) is a two
sided ideal of C (−, ?). Thus we can considerer the quotient category C/IB.
The canonical functor π : C −→ C/IB induces an exact functor by restriction
resC : Mod (C/IB) −→ Mod (C) deﬁned by resC(F ) := F ◦ π for all F ∈ Mod (C/IB).
Thus,

(i) resC(F )(C) = F (C) for all C ∈ C.
(ii) resC(F ) (f ) = F
We denote by K the full subcategory of Mod(C) whose objects are the functors
in Mod(C) that vanish in B. That is, K = {F ∈ Mod(C) | resB(F ) = 0}. We prove
that K is isomorphic to the category Mod(C/IB)

for all f ∈ C (C, C′).

Lemma 3.3. Let B be a full additive subcategory of C.
(i) Let F be a C/IB-module, then resC(F ) ∈ K.
(ii) Let G ∈ K be, then G(f ) = 0 for all f ∈ IB(C, C′) and for all C, C′ ∈ C.

Proof. (i) Let B ∈ B. Then

1resC(F )(B) = resC(F )(1B) = F (1B) = F (1B + IB(B, B)) = F (0) = 0.

Thus resC(F )(B) = 0.
(ii) It is clear.

Now, we deﬁne a functor α : K −→ Mod(C/IB) given by α(G)(C) = G(C) for
all G ∈ K and for all C ∈ C and also α(G)(f ) = G(f ) for all f = f + IB(C, C′) ∈
C/IB(C, C′).
It is clear that α(G) is well deﬁned in morphisms. Indeed, if f =
g ∈ C/IB(C, C′) then f − g ∈ IB(C, C′) therefore by Lemma 3.3, we get that
0 = G(f − g) = G(f ) − G(g), thus α(G)(f ) = α(G)(g).

Lemma 3.4. The functors resC : Mod(C/IB) −→ Mod(C) and α : K −→ Mod(C/IB)
induce an isomorphism of categories between the categories Mod(C/IB) and K. In
this way resC is a full embedding functor which essential image is K, and K =
Ker(resB).

Proof. Let F ∈ Mod(C/IB). The for all C ∈ C we have (α ◦ resC)(F )(C) = F (C)
and for all f ∈ C/IB(C, C′) we obtain

(α ◦ resC)(F )(f ) = α(resC(F ))(f )

(resC(F ) ∈ K by 3.3)

= resC(F )(f )

= F (f ).

On the other hand, let G ∈ K be, then for all C ∈ C/IB we have (resC ◦ α)(G)(C) =
resC(α(G))(C) = resC(G(C)) = G(C) and for all f ∈ HomC(C, C′)

(resC ◦ α)(G)(f ) = resC(α(G))(f ) = (α(G))(f ) = G(f ).

It follows that α ◦ resC = 1Mod(C) and resC ◦ α = 1K. The rest of the proof is
(cid:3)
clear.

Now we will construct a triple adjoint (C/IB⊗C, resC, C(C/IB,−)):

Mod(C/IB)

C/IB⊗C

In order to construct this, we will need some preparatory results.

Lemma 3.5. Let C, C′ ∈ C.

(i) Asume f ∈ HomC(C, C′). Then we have a morphism of Cop-modules
C(−, C)

So we establish the following proposition.

Now we are ready to prove the main result of this section.

Theorem 3.10. Let C be an a additive category and B be a full additive subcategory
of C. Then there is a recollement:

Proof.

(R1) By Propositions 2.2, 2.3, 3.7 and 3.9, the triples

C⊗B, resB, B(C, −)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

and

C/IB⊗C, resC, C(C/IB, −)

are adjoint triples.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(R2) By Lemma 3.4, we have resBresC = 0.
(R3) By Lemma 3.4 and Propositions 2.2 and 2.3, resC, C⊗B and B(C, −) are full

embedding functors.

(cid:3)

It is worth to mention that in the context of dualizing K-varieties, Y, Ogawa in

[34, Theorem 2.5] have proved the following result.

Theorem 3.11. Let C be a dualizing K-variety and B a functorially ﬁnite subcat-

We adapt the arguments given in [11] to prove Theorem 4.1. Thus, we ﬁrst recall

some notation and results of [21].

In [21] the notion of triangular matrix category was introduced. For convenience
of the reader, we recall brieﬂy these concepts. Let U, T additive categories and
M ∈ Mod(U ⊗ T op), the triangular matrix category Λ = [ T 0
M U ] is deﬁned as
follows.

(a) The class of objects of this category are matrices [ T 0

T and U are in T and U respectively.

In 4.3 we will recall brieﬂy the deﬁnition of the functor above mentionated.

Remark 4.3. Let R, S, T additive categories and consider an additive functor
M ∈ Mod(R ⊗ T op). For all T ∈ T we have the functor MT : R −→ Ab deﬁned
as follows:

(1) MT (R) := M (R, T ), for all R ∈ R.
(2) MT (r) := M (r ⊗ 1T ) : MT (R) −→ MT (R′), for all r ∈ HomR(R, R′).

Also for all t ∈ HomT (T, T ′) we have a morphism of R-modules ¯t : MT ′ −→
MT such that ¯t = {[¯t]R : MT ′(R) −→ MT (R)}R∈R where [¯t]R = M (1R ⊗ top) :
M (R, T ′) −→ M (R, T ).
So we have the functor G1 : Mod(R) −→ Mod(T ) as follows:

(1) G1(B)(T ) := HomMod(R)(MT , B), for all B ∈ Mod(R) and for all T ∈ T .
Moreover G1(B)(t) := HomMod(R)(¯t, B) for all B ∈ Mod(R) and for all
t ∈ HomT (T, T ′).

(2) If η : B −→ B′ is a morphism of R-modules, G1(η) : G1(B) −→ G1(B′)
is deﬁned by G1(η) = {[G1(η)]T : G1(B)(T ) −→ G1(B′)(T )}T ∈T , with
[G1(η)]T := HomMod(R)(MT , η).

Hence we have the comma category

categories

Mod(T ), G1Mod(R)
(cid:17)
(cid:16)

and a equivalence of

Mod(T ), G1Mod(R)
(cid:17)
Similarly, given M ∈ Mod(R ⊗ T op) we have M ∈ Mod(T op ⊗ R) and a functor

∼−→ Mod([ T 0

M R ]).

(cid:16)

G : Mod(T op) −→ Mod(Rop) (see section 4 in [21]).

Deﬁnition 4.4. Let F : Mod(R) → Mod(S) an additive functor and M ∈ Mod(R⊗
T op). We deﬁne a bimodule in Mod(S ⊗ T op) denoted by N := F (M ) as follows,
the functor N = F (M ) : S ⊗ T op → Ab is given by:
(i) N (S, T ) := F (MT )(S) for all (S, T ) ∈ S ⊗ T op.
(ii) Let g ⊗ top : (S, T ) → (S′, T ′) where g : S → S′ in S and t : T ′ → T in T .
Since ¯t : MT → MT ′ is a morphism of R-modules, then F (¯t) : F (MT ) → F (MT ′)
is a morphism of S-modules. Thus we have the following commutative diagram.
[F (¯t)]S

F (MT )(S)

F (MT ′ )(S)

F (MT )(g)

F (MT ′ )(g)

F (MT )(S′)

[F (¯t)]S′

F (MT ′ )(S′)

Hence we deﬁne N (g ⊗ top) := F (MT ′)(g) ◦ [F (¯t)]S = [F (¯t)]S′ ◦ F (MT )(g).

Now, that we have a bimodule N ∈ Mod(S ⊗ T op) we deﬁne a functor G2 similar

to G1. For convenience of the reader we repeat its construction.
Remark 4.5. We deﬁne a functor G2 : Mod(S) → Mod(T ) as follows:

(1) G2(L)(T ) := HomMod(S)(NT , L), for all L ∈ Mod(S) and for all T ∈ T ,
where NT := F (MT ) ∈ Mod(S). Moreover G2(L)(t) := HomMod(S)(F (¯t), L)
for all L ∈ Mod(S) and for all t ∈ HomT (T ′, T ).

(2) If γ : L −→ L′ is a morphism of S-modules we deﬁne G2(γ) : G2(L) −→

G2(L′) as:
G2(γ) =

Since N = F (M ) ∈ Mod(S⊗T op) , we have the comma category

[G2(γ)]T := HomMod(S)(NT , γ) : G2(L)(T ) −→ G2(L′)(T )
T ∈T .

Similarly, for all L ∈ Mod(S) and T ∈ T , G deﬁnes a mapping

GNT ,L : HomMod(S)(NT , L) −→ HomMod(R)(GNT , GL), g 7→ G(g).

In this way we have the following lemma.

Lemma 4.6. Let M ∈ Mod(R ⊗ T op) be.

(a1) For all B ∈ Mod(R), the family FM,B := {FMT ,B : G1(B)(T ) → (G2 ◦
F )(B)(T )}T ∈T is natural transformation, that is, FM,B : G1(B) → (G2 ◦
F )(B) is a morphism of T -modules.

(a2) ξ := FM,− : G1 −→ G2 ◦ F is a natural transformation.
(b1) Suppose that MT = G(NT ) for all T ∈ T . Then for all L ∈ Mod(S), the
family GN,L := {GNT ,L : G2(L)(T ) → (G1 ◦ G)(L)(T )}T ∈T is a natural
transformation, that is, GN,L : G2(L) → (G1 ◦ G)(L) is a morphism of
T -modules.

(b2) ρ := GN,− = G2 −→ G1 ◦ G is a natural transformation.

Proof. Since F (MT ) = NT , for all B ∈ Mod(R) and T ∈ T we have G1(B)(T ) =
HomMod(R)(MT , B) and (G2 ◦ F )(B)(T ) = HomMod(S)(F (MT ), F (B)).
(a1) Let t ∈ HomT (T, T ′) and B ∈ Mod(S). We have to show that the following
diagram commutes

(b1) and (b2). Suppose that MT = G(NT ) for all T ∈ T . Then, for all L ∈
Mod(S) and T ∈ T we have G2(L)(T ) = HomMod(S)(NT , L) and (G1 ◦ G)(L)(T ) =
HomMod(R)(G(NT ), G(L)). Therefore the prove of (b1) and (b2) is similar to (a1)

Deﬁnition 4.7. [11, Deﬁnition 3.2] Let G1 : A → D, G2 : B → D, F : A → B
and H : B → A be additive functors. Assume that (F, H) is an adjoint pair, with
η being the adjugant equivalence. We say that the pair (G1, G2) is compatible with
the adjoint pair (F, H) if there exist two natural transformations

In order to prove Theorem 4.1 we need the following result which generalizes [11,

Lemma 4.2].

Lemma 4.10. Let R, S and T be abelian categories and F : Mod(R) −→ Mod(S)
and G : Mod(S) −→ Mod(R) be additive functors. For M ∈ Mod(R ⊗ T op)
considere the additive functors G1 : Mod(R) −→ Mod(T ) and G2 : Mod(S) −→
Mod(T ) as we have deﬁned in 4.3 and 4.5 where NT = F (MT ). If (F, G) is an
adjoint pair and its unit ε : 1Mod(R) −→ GF satisﬁes εMT = 1MT for all T ∈ T ,
then the pair (G1, G2) is compatible with (F, G).

Proof. Since (F, G) is an adjoint pair there exist a natural equivalence

η :={ηB,L : HomMod(S)(F B, L) → HomMod(R)(B, GL)}B∈Mod(R), L∈Mod(S)
By Lemma 4.6 (a2) we have natural transformations ξ := FM,− : G1 −→ G2F .
Since εMT = 1MT , we have that G(NT ) = MT for all T ∈ T and by 4.6 (b2), we
have a natural transformation ρ := GN,− = G2 −→ G1G.
First we will see that for all L ∈ Mod(S) the morphism

ρL : G2(L) −→ G1G(L)

is a monomorphism in Mod(T ). Indeed, for T ∈ T we have to show that

[ρL]T := GNT ,L : HomMod(S)(NT , L) → HomMod(R)(MT , G(L))

is a monomorphism. Consider the morphism

ηMT ,L : HomMod(S)(F (MT ), L) −→ HomMod(R)(MT , G(L)).

We assert that ηMT ,L = GNT ,L. Indeed, let β ∈ HomMod(S)(F (MT ), L). Then we
have the following commutative diagram

HomMod(S)(F (MT ), F (MT ))

ηMT ,F (MT )

HomMod(R)(MT , GF (MT ))

HomMod(S)(F (MT ),β)

HomMod(R)(MT ,G(β))

Since 1MT = εMT = ηMT ,F (MT )(1F (MT )) then G(β) = ηMT ,L(β). Since GNT ,L(β) =
G(β) and ηMT ,L is injective, it follows that GNT ,L is injective, for all T ∈ T . Prov-
ing that ρL is a monomorphism for each L ∈ Mod(S).
Now we have to show that G1(ηB,L(f )) = ρLG2(f )ξB for all f ∈ HomMod(S)(F (B), L).
That is, we have to show that

[G1 (ηB,L(f ))]T = ρNT ,L[G2(f )]T ξMT ,B ∀T ∈ T .
Let α ∈ HomMod(R)(MT , B)be. It follows from the following commutative diagram

= GNT ,L(f ◦ F (α))
= G(f ◦ F (α)).

Proving that (G1, G2) is compatible with (F, G).

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 4.1. We only prove (a), since (b) is similar. Set N = j!(M )
as in 4.4, and consider the additive functors G1 : Mod(R) → Mod(T ) and G2 :
Mod(S) → Mod(T ) as deﬁned in 4.3 and 4.5. Since j! is a full embedding, by [11,
Lemma 2.1], we may assume that the unit ǫ : 1 → j!j!, of the adjoint pair (j!, j!),
is the identity. In particular, we have that ǫMT = 1MT . Thus, from Lemma 4.10,
the pair (G1, G2) is compatible with (j!, j!) and the rest follows from Theorem 4.9
(cid:3)
and 4.2.

Recall that two additive categories C and D are called Morita equivalent if the
functor categories Mod(C) and Mod(D) are equivalent.

Corollary 4.11. Let R, S, and T additive categories, and M ∈ Mod(R ⊗ T op). If
R is Morita equivalent to S, then there exists a functor N ∈ Mod(S ⊗ T op) making
the triangular matrix category ( T 0

M R ) Morita equivalent to ( T 0

N S ).

Proof. The same proof as in [11, Corollary 4.7] works for this setting.

Thus we deﬁne [Ψ′
HomMod(C)(HomC(U, −), B) is the Yoneda isomorphism.
By [21, Proposition 4.7], there exists a morphism of Cop-modules ΨB : DC(B) →
GDCG(B). Hence, for B ∈ Mod(C), U ∈ Cop and s ∈ HomK(B(U ), K), we have a
morphism of Cop-modules [ΨB]U (s) := SB,U : HomC(−, U ) −→ DCG(B). Therefore,
we get that the morphism [SB,U ]U (1U ) : HomMod(C)(HomC(U, −), B) −→ K is
deﬁned as

6. Auslander-Reiten translate in the category of maps

e

Let R be a commutative ring. Almost split sequences for dualizing varietes were
studied by M. Auslander and Idun Reiten in mod(C) for a R-dualizing variety C as
a generalization of the concept of Almost split sequences for mod(Λ) for an artin R-
algebra (see [6]). The crucial ingredient is the explicit construction of the Auslander-
Reiten translate τ by taking the dual of the transpose DTrM of a ﬁnitely presented
C-module M . The duality DC : mod(C) → mod(Cop) for dualizing varieties C is given
in deﬁnition 2.7 and the transpose Tr : mod(C) → mod(Cop) is deﬁned as follows:
consider the functor (−)∗ : mod(C) → mod(Cop) deﬁned by (M )∗(C) = (M, (C, −)),
for all M ∈ mod(C), and C ∈ C, then take a minimal projective resolution for M :

(f,−)
−−−→ (Y, −) → M → 0, thus TrM := Coker ((f, −)∗).

(X, −)
For that reason in this section, we study the transpose and the dual in the cat-
egory of maps. In the same way as in the classic case, we have a duality (−)∗ :
between the projectives in
proj

mod(Cop), mod(Cop)

mod(C), mod(C)

−→ proj

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
the category of maps (see proposition 6.8).
One of the main results in this section is to describe the Auslander-Reiten translate
in the category of maps which will be denoted by Tau. In particular, we show that
if f : C1 −→ C2 is a morphism in mod(C) such that there exists exact sequence

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

/ C2

/ C3

/ 0 with C3 6= 0 and C3 not projective. Then

Tau(C1, f, C2) = (DCop (Y ), DCop (g), DCop Tr(C3))
for some morphism g : Tr(C3) −→ Y such that there exists an exact sequence
/ DCop Tr(C3) and where Tr denotes the

0
Auslander-Reiten translate in mod(C) (see theorem 6.13).
In order to have all the ingredients to prove the above result, we consider Λ =
[ T 0
M U ] the matrix triangular category. Now, we recall the construction of a functor

/ DCop Tr(C1)

By section 5 in [21], we know that there exists a functor F : Mod(T ) −→ Mod(U)

(cid:17)
(cid:16)
bijection ϕA,B : HomMod(U )(F(A), B) −→ HomMod(T )(A, G(B)).
By deﬁnition, we have that H(A, h, B) := (A, ϕA,B(h), B). Then we have
ϕ := ϕHomT (T,−),MT : HomMod(U )(MT , MT ) −→ HomMod(T )(HomT (T, −), G(MT ))
because F(HomT (T, −)) = MT (see [21, Lemma 5.7(i)]). By [28, Theorem 6.3], we
have that in this case the isomorphism ϕ coincides with the Yoneda isomorphism.
Then for λ : MT −→ MT , we have that ϕ(λ) : HomT (T, −) −→ G(MT ) is such
that for T ′ ∈ T

and consider the

ﬁnitely geneerated objects.

Proposition 6.7. Let us denote by proj

Mod(T ), GMod(U)

the category of

ﬁnitely generated projective objects in

(b) Suppose that U and T are dualizing varieties and MT ∈ mod(U) and MU ∈

mod(T op) for all U ∈ U and T ∈ T op. Then we have a duality

(cid:17)(cid:17)

(cid:16)(cid:16)

Proof. .
(a) It is known that the funtor (−)∗ restricts to a duality (−)∗ : proj(Mod(Λ)) −→
proj(Mod(Λop)) (see [6] in page 337). Since
≃ Mod(Λ) and

Mod(T ), GMod(U)
(cid:17)
(cid:16)

Mod(U op), GMod(T op)
≃ Mod(Λop) we have the result.
(cid:17)
(cid:16)
(b). Since proj(Mod(Λ)) ⊆ mod(Λ), we have that proj(mod(Λ)) = proj(Mod(Λ)).
mod(T ), Gmod(U)
≃ mod(Λop).
Since

The result follows from (a).

where α : P0 −→ A is a projective cover. Then, the morphism (α, f α) :

Proof. Let us see that (α, γ) is minimal. Indeed, let

cover, we have that it is minimal and hence θ1 is an isomorphism. Now, since (∗) is
a morphism in the category of maps, we have the following commutative diagram

=
(0, βa22) = (0, β). Hence, β = βa22 and since β is minimal, we have that a22
(cid:2)
(cid:3)
is an isomorphism. Since a12 : Q0 −→ P0, we have the morphism a−1
11 a12a−1
22 :
Q0 −→ P0. Now it is easy to show that θ−1

(cid:16)
Now, we are able to describe that Auslander-Reiten translate in the category

c

maps(mod(C)).
Let C be a dualizing K-variety. It is well known that under this conditions C is
Krull-Schmidt (see page 318 in [5]) and therefore we have the every C-module in
mod(C) has a minimal projective presentation (see for example [25, Lemma 2.1]).
Then we can deﬁne the transpose in mod(C) which we will denote by Tr. That is,
Tr : mod(C) → mod(Cop).

Theorem 6.13. Let C be a dualizing and consider the equivalence mod(Λ) ∼−→
maps(mod(C)) given in 5.4(ii) and the duality DCop : mod(Cop) −→ mod(C). Let
f : C1 −→ C2 be a morphism in mod(C) such that there exists exact sequence

C1

f

/ C2

/ C3

/ 0 with C3 6= 0 and C3 not projective. Then

Tau(C1, f, C2) = (DCop (Y ), DCop (g), DCop Tr(C3))

for some morphism g : Tr(C3) −→ Y such that there exists an exact sequence

0

/ DCop Tr(C1)

/ DCop (Y )

DCop (g)/

/ DCop Tr(C3)

Proof. Since C is an additive category with ﬁnite coproducts and with splitting
idempotenst, we have that every ﬁnitely presented projective C-module P is of
the form HomC(C, −) for some object C ∈ C (see [5] ). Then in all what follows
whenever we write a projective C-module P , we mean a projective module of the
form HomC(C, −) for some object C ∈ C.
Let f : C1 −→ C2 a morphism in mod(C) and C3 = Coker(f ), following 6.10, we
construct a minimal projective presentation of (C1, f, C2)

7. Almost Split Sequences in the maps category

Dualizing K-categories were introduced by Auslander and Reiten as a general-
ization of artin K-algebras (see [6]). It is well-known that the existence of almost
split sequences is quite useful in the representation theory of artin algebras. A K-
category A being dualizing ensures that the category mod(A) of ﬁnitely presented
functors in Mod(A) has almost split sequences (see theorem 7.1.3 in [32]). From
a given dualizing K-category A there are some known constructions of dualizing
K-categories such as mod(A), the functorially ﬁnite Krull-Schmidt categories of A,
residue categories A/(1A) of A module the ideal (1A) of A generated by the iden-
tity morphism 1A of an object A ∈ A and the category Cb(mod(A)) of bounded
complexes over mod(A) (see [9]).
Let C be a dualizing K-variety, and Λ =

sequences in mod(Λ) that arise from almost split sequences in mod(C). That is, we
consider almost split sequences in mod(Λ) ≃ maps(mod(C)) of the form

0 → (N1, g, N2)

(j2, j1)
−−−−−→ (E1, h, E2)

(π1, π2)

such that (M1, f, M2) is one of the following cases (M, 1M , M ), (M, 0, 0), (0, 0, M ),
with M a non projective indecomposable C-module, and (N1, g, N2) is one of the
following cases (N, 1N , N ), (N, 0, 0), (0, 0, N ), with N a non injective indecompos-
able C-module.
The following which is a generalization of [24, Theorem 3.1(a), Theorem 3.2 (a)].

Proposition 7.1. Let C be a dualizing K-variety.

(1) Let 0 → τ M

j
−→ E π−→ M → 0 be an almost split sequence of C-modules.

Then the exact sequences in maps(mod(C)):
(π, 1M )
(j, 0)
−−−−−→ (M, 1M , M ) → 0,
−−−→ (E, π, M )
(0, π)

−−−−−→ (τ M, j, E)

(ii) 0 → (τ M, 1τ M , τ M )

(i) 0 → (τ M, 0, 0)

are almost split.

(2) Let 0 → N

j
−→ E π−→ τ −1N → 0 an almost split sequence of C-modules.

Then the exact sequences in maps(mod(C)):
(0, π)
−−−−→ (0, 0, τ −1N ) → 0
(π, 1τ −1N )
−−−−−−−→ (τ −1N, 1τ −1N , τ −1N ) →

−−−→ (E, π, τ −1N )

(i) 0 → (N, 1N , N )

(ii) 0 → (N, 0, 0)

are almost split.

Proof. (1) (i) Since π : E → M does not splits, the map (π, 1M ) : (E, π, M ) →
(M, 1M , M ) does not split. Let (q1, q2) : (X1, f, X2) → (M, 1M , M ) be a map that
is not a splittable epimorphism. Then q2f = 1M q1 = q1.

We claim that q1 is not a splittable epimorphism. Indeed, if q1 is a splittable
epimorphism, then there exists a morphism s : M → X1, such that q1s = 1M . Thus,
we have a morphism (s, f s) : (M, 1M , M ) → (X1, f, X2) and we get that (q1, q2) ◦
(s, f s) = (1M , 1M ) = 1(M,1M ,M) : (M, 1M , M ) → (M, 1M , M ) and hence (q1, q2) :
(X1, X2, f ) → (M, M, 1M ) is a splittable epimorphism which is a contradiction.
Since π : E → M is a right almost split morphism, there exists a map h : X1 → E
such that πh = q1, and q2f = q1 = πh. Thus, we have a morphism (h, q2) :
(X1, f, X2) → (E, π, M ), and the following commutative diagram

(X1, f, X2)

(h, q2)

zttttttttttttt

(π, 1M )

(q1, q2)

(E, π, M )

(M, 1M , M )

That is, we get a lifting (h, q2) : (X1, f, X2) → (E, π, M ) of (q1, q2) and we have
proved that (π, 1M ) is right almost split and thus τ (M, 1M , M ) = (τ M, 0, 0).
(ii). Let (q1, q2) : (X1, f, X2) → (0, 0, M ) be a map that is not a splittable epi-
morphism. Then q2 : X2 → M is not a splittable epimorphism and q1 = 0. Since
π : E → M is a right almost split epimorphism, there exists u : X2 → E such that
q2 = πu. Then π(uf ) = (πu)f = q2f = 0q1 = 0 and since j = Ker(π) we have that
there exists a morphism v : X1 → τ (M ) such that uf = jv. Therefore we wet a map
(v, u) : (X1, f, X2) → (τ M, j, E) and we have that (0, π)(v, u) = (0, q2) = (q1, q2).
Proving that (0, π) is right almost split.
(2) follows by duality.

In this way, we conclude that almost split sequences in the category maps(mod(C))

for every Z ∈ X .
A subcategory X of C is contravariantly (covariantly) ﬁnite in C if every object
M ∈ C has a right (left) X -approximation; and C is functorially ﬁnite if it is both
contravariantly and covariantly ﬁnite.

8.1. Functorially ﬁnite subcategories in mod(Λ) and a result of Smalø. In
this subsection we prove a result that generalizes the given by S. O. Smalø in [35,
Theorem 2.1] and we will see some implications that it give us respect the category
mod(C) for a dualizing variety C.

Theorem 8.1. Let A and B be abelian categories and G : B −→ A a covariant
functor. Consider the comma category (G(B), A) and X ⊆ A and Y ⊆ B subcate-
gories containing the zero object. We denote by DY
X the full subcategory of (G(B), A)
whose objects are: the morphisms g : G(B) −→ A with B ∈ Y and A ∈ X . Then
DY
X is covariant ﬁnite in (G(B), A) if and only if X ⊆ A and Y ⊆ B are covariant
ﬁnite subcategories.

Proof. (⇐=). Let g : G(B) −→ A an object in (G(B), A). Since Y is covariant
ﬁnite, there exists an Y-left approximation αB : B −→ YB. Then we have the
following pushout diagram in A

(∗) : G(B)

Since X is covariant ﬁnite in A we have a X -left approximation βC : C −→ XC .
Then we have the following commutative diagram

G(YB)

g

A

βC g′

/ XC

βC δ

Then, we have the object (YB, βC g′, XC ) ∈ DY
(B, g, A) −→ (YB, βCg′, XC ) is a DY
Indeed, let (λ, ϕ) : (B, g, A) −→ (B′, f, A′) a morphism in (G(B), A) with B′ ∈ Y
and A′ ∈ X .
Since λ : B −→ B′ is a morphism in B with B′ ∈ B, there exists a morphism
λ′ : YB −→ B′ such that λ = λ′ ◦ αB. Then we get the following commutative
diagram

X -left approximation of (B, g, A).

Since the diagram (∗) is pushout, there exists a morphism σ : C −→ A′ such
that σg′ = f G(λ′) and σδ = ϕ. Since A′ ∈ X and βC : C −→ XC is a X -left
approximation of C, there exists a morphism σ′ : XC −→ A′ such that σ = σ′βC .

which is commutative since f G(λ′) = σg′ = σ′βCg′. Moreover we have that
σ′βCδ = σδ = ϕ and since λ = λ′ ◦ αB we have that G(λ) = G(λ′)G(αB). There-
fore, the morphism (λ, ϕ) factor through the morphism (αB, βC δ). Proving that
DY
(=⇒). Let us suppose that DY
X is covariant ﬁnite in (G(B), A). Let B be and object
in B. Consider the object g : G(B) −→ 0 in (G(B), A). Since DY
X is covariant ﬁnite,
there exists and object β : G(Y ) −→ X with Y ∈ Y and X ∈ X and a morphism
(λ, θ) : (B, 0, 0) −→ (Y, β, X) which is a left DY
X -approximation. We assert that
λ : B → Y is a left Y-approximation. Indeed, let γ : B → Y ′ a morphism in B with
Y ′ ∈ Y. Then we have the following commutative diagram

G(B)

Since (λ, θ) : (B, 0, 0) −→ (Y, β, X) is a left DY
X -approximation, there exists (ψ, τ ) :
(Y, β, X) −→ (Y ′, 0, 0) such that (γ, 0) = (ψ, τ ) ◦ (λ, θ). Therefore, we get that
γ = ψλ, proving that λ : B → Y is a left Y-approximation. Thus, Y is covariantly
(cid:3)
ﬁnite in B. Similarly, X is covariantly ﬁnite in A.

Theorem 8.2. Let A and B be abelian categories and F : A −→ B, G : B −→ A a
covariant functors such that G is left adjoint to F . Consider the comma category
(B, F (A)) and X ⊆ A, Y ⊆ B subcategories containing the zero object. We denote
by CY
X the full subcategory of (B, F (A)) whose objects are: the morphisms f : B −→
F (A) with B ∈ Y and A ∈ X . Then CY
X is funtorially ﬁnite in (B, F (A)) if and
only if X ⊆ A and Y ⊆ B are functorially ﬁnite.

Proof. We have isomorphism

ϕB,A : HomA(G(B), A) −→ HomB(B, F (A))

This deﬁnes an isomorphism between the comma categories

Φ :

B, F (A)

Denote by DY

X the full subcategory of (B, F (A))
whose objects are: the morphisms f : B −→ F (A) with B ∈ Y and A ∈ X . Then
we have an isomorphism

Φ : DY

By 8.1, and its dual we get that DY

Corollary 8.3. Let U and T additive categories and M ∈ Mod(U ⊗ T op) and
M U ]. If X ⊆ U and Y ⊆ T are subcategories, denote by (Y, GX )
consider Λ = [ T 0
the full subcategory of
whose objects are morphisms of T -
modules f : B −→ G(A) with B ∈ Y and A ∈ X . Then (Y, GX ) is a covariantly
(contravariantly, functorially) ﬁnite subcategory of Mod
if and only if Y ⊆

Mod(T ), GMod(U)

(cid:16)

T and X ⊆ U are covariantly (contravariantly, functorially) ﬁnite.

[ T 0

(cid:17)

Proof. By section 5 in [21], we have left adjoint F : Mod(T ) −→ Mod(U) to G and
Mod(T ), GMod(U)
.
by [21, Theorem 3.14], there is equivalence

The result follows from 8.1 its dual and 8.2.

Corollary 8.4. Let U and T dualizing varieties and M ∈ Mod(U ⊗ T op) such that
MT ∈ mod(U) and MU ∈ mod(T ) for all U ∈ U and T ∈ T . Consider Λ = [ T 0
M U ].
If X ⊆ U and Y ⊆ T are subcategories, denote by (Y, GX ) the full subcategory
of
whose objects are morphisms of T -modules f : B −→
G(A) with B ∈ Y and A ∈ X . Then (Y, GX ) is a covariantly (contravariantly,
if and only if Y ⊆ T and X ⊆ U
functorially) ﬁnite subcategory of mod
are covariantly (contravariantly, functorially) ﬁnite.

Therefore the result follows from 8.1 its dual and 8.2.

. We also have an adjoint pair (F∗, G∗) by [21, Proposition 6.2].

The following is the generalization of a result of Smalø [35, Corollary 2.2].

Corollary 8.5. Let U and T dualizing varieties and M ∈ Mod(U ⊗ T op) such that
MT ∈ mod(U) and MU ∈ mod(T ) for all U ∈ U and T ∈ T . Consider Λ = [ T 0
M U ].
If X ⊆ U and Y ⊆ T are functorially ﬁnite which are closed under extensions.
Then (Y, GX ) is functorially ﬁnite subcategory of mod
which is closed
(cid:16)
under extensions and moreover (Y, GX ) has almost split sequences.

[ T 0
M U ]

(cid:17)

Proof. By [21, Proposition 6.10], it follows that Λ is a dualizing R-variety and
therefore mod(Λ) is Krull-Schmidt. Since X ⊆ mod(U) and Y ⊆ mod(T ) are
closed under extensions, this also holds for (Y, GX ). Thus, (Y, GX ) is a Krull-
Schmidt subcategory of (mod(T ), Gmod(U)) ≃ mod(Λ), and the rest of the proof
(cid:3)
follows from [22, Corollary 3.5].

Corollary 8.6. Let C be a dualizing K-variety and X ⊂ mod(C) be a subcate-
gory. Denote by maps(X ) the full subcategory of maps(mod(C)) whose objects are
morphisms of C-modules f : B −→ A with A, B ∈ X . Then X is contravariantly
(covariantly, functorially) ﬁnite in mod(C) if and only if maps(X ) is contravariantly
(covariantly, functorially) ﬁnite in maps(mod(C)).

Corollary 8.7. Let R be a commutative ring and Λ be an artin R-algebra. Con-
sider C = mod(Λ) and X ⊂ mod(C) be a subcategory. Then X is contravariantly
(covariantly, functorially) ﬁnite in mod(C) if and only if maps(X ) is contravariantly
(covariantly, functorially) ﬁnite in maps(mod(C)).

8.2. Functorially ﬁnite subcategories in mod(mod(C)). Let C be a dualiz-
ing variety. By Corollary 8.6 there is a close relation between contravariantly,
covariantly and functorially subcategories in mod(modΛ)) and contravariantly, co-
variantly and functorially subcategories in maps(mod(C)).

Now, consider the matrix category Λ :=
categories

Recall, we have the functor (see 7.6)

Ψ : mod

→ maps(mod(C)).

i (cid:17)

Φ : maps(mod(C)) −→ mod(mod(C)op)

f

/ A0) = Coker
(cid:16)

given by Φ( A1
(−, A1)
Now, we list some ways to get functorially ﬁnite subcategories in maps(modΛ).
Obviously Ψ(X ) is functorially ﬁnite in maps(mod(C)) if X is a functorially ﬁnite
. In this part we will see that some properties like:
subcategory in mod

/ (−, A0)

(cid:17)

.

(−,f ) /

contravariantly, covariantly, functorially ﬁnite subcategories of maps(mod(C)), are
preserved by the functor Φ.
The following result is a generalization of a result in [24].

Hom C i (cid:17)

Theorem 8.8. Let C ⊂ maps(mod(C)) be a subcategory. Then the following state-
ments hold:

(a) If C is contravariantly ﬁnite in maps(mod(C)), then Φ(C ) is a contravari-

antly ﬁnite subcategory of mod(mod(C)op).

(b) If C is covariantly ﬁnite in maps(mod(C)), then Φ(C ) is a covariantly ﬁnite

subcategory of mod(mod(C)op).

(c) If C is functorially ﬁnite in maps(mod(C)), then Φ(C ) is a functorially

ﬁnite subcategory of mod(mod(C)op).

Proof. Same proof as in [24, Theorem 3.8]

(cid:3)

Remark 8.9. We can deﬁne the functor Φ′ : maps(mod(C)) → mod(mod(C)) as:

Φ′ : (A1

f
−→ A0) = Coker((A0, −)

(f,−)
−−−→ (A1, −)).

The same properties: contravariantly, covariantly, functorialy ﬁnite subcategories
of maps(mod(C)), are preserved by the functor Φ′.

On the other hand, if X is a functorially ﬁnite subcategory of mod(C), we get
that maps(X ) is a functorially ﬁnite subcategory of maps(mod(C)), by Corollary
8.6. Thus we have a way to get contravariantly (covariantly, functorially) ﬁnite
subcategories in maps(mod(C)) from the ones of mod(C), which of course are in

bijective correspondence with ones in mod
we have induced maps:

(cid:16) h

C
\
Hom C

i (cid:17)

by the equivalence Ψ. Thus,

{functorially ﬁnite subcategories C ⊂ maps(mod(C))}

C

{functorially ﬁnite subcategories E ⊂ mod(mod(C)op)}

Φ(C )

y

E

{functorially ﬁnite subcategories F ⊂ maps(mod(mod(C)op))}

maps(E )

y

Finally, we have the following examples of functorially ﬁnite subcategories of the
category maps(mod(C)).
We denote by emaps(mod(C)) the full subcategory of maps(mod(C)) consisting of
all maps (M1, f, M2), such that f is an epimorphism and by mmaps(mod(C)) the
full subcategory of maps(mod(C)) consisting of all maps (M1, f, M2), such that f
is an monomorphism.

Proposition 8.10. The categories emaps(mod(C)) and mmaps(mod(C)) are func-
torially ﬁnite in maps(mod(C)).

Proof. The proof given in [24, Theorem 3.12] works for this setting.
