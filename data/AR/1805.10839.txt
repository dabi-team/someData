Abstract

Using a free-running distributed-feedback quantum cascade laser (QCL) emitting at

9.54 µm, the pressure shift parameters of four intense rovibrational transitions in the

ν3 fundamental band of ozone induced by oxygen (O2), air and the noble gases helium

(He), argon (Ar), and xenon (Xe) are obtained by employing second harmonic detec-

tion. The experimental analysis comprises a full uncertainty budget and provides line

shift data which are traceable to SI. The high density of transitions in the ν3 spectral
region of ozone make this region particularly diﬃcult to study with more commonly

used techniques such as Fourier transform spectroscopy. The comparatively high spec-

tral resolution of the QCL in the MHz range, on the contrary, allows to measure molec-

ular shifts at relatively low pressures (from 2 to 70 hPa), thus reducing the impact of

spectral congestion due to pressure broadening of molecular lines. The comparison of

our results with published data shows that presently recommended values for the pres-

sure shift are too low in this region. This observation is corroborated by semi-classical

calculations using the Robert-Bonamy formalism. A slight negative J dependence, al-

ready observed in other ozone vibrational bands, is predicted. Systematic use of our

technique could be very useful to support this hypothesis and to make up for the lack of

shift parameters for ozone ν3 transitions in molecular spectral databases. A subsequent

1. Introduction

Ozone (O3) is the tri-atomic allotrope of oxygen and its chemical formula has been

identiﬁed almost exactly 150 years ago ﬁrst by Soret and shortly later by Sch¨onbein [1].

The molecule plays a pivotal role in Earth’s atmosphere. It is a unique absorber of ul-

traviolet (UV), visible and infrared (IR) radiation, thus greatly inﬂuencing the thermal

structure of Earth’s atmosphere, protecting Earth’s surface from energetic solar UV

irradiation, and playing a role in global climate - chemistry feedback. Moreover, the

molecule is an irritant that is key in atmospheric oxidation chemistry.

Precise determinations of local ozone mixing ratios or abundance proﬁles in the

atmosphere are thus of great interest and can be obtained through spectroscopic mea-

surements in all spectral domains from the UV to the Far-IR. In the light of new studies

and more stringent user requirements, the re-evaluation and new measurements of data

covering all these domains are under way [2–7]. The spectral region at 10 µm is of

particular interest for these measurements which is due to the absence of water absorp-

tions in this atmospheric ’window’ and the presence of the strongest fundamental (ν3)

of ozone. The inversion of atmospheric spectra, however, requires a precise knowl-

edge of ozone spectral line parameters such as position, intensity, line broadening, and

shifting parameters [3, 5, 8], with required relative uncertainties decreasing with the or-

der in which parameters are listed. In most atmospheric applications, line shifting has

thus be neglected altogether [9]. More recently, however, line shift data have become a

concern in atmospheric applications [10]. One reason being the increasing spectral res-

olution in modern instrumentation that leads to increased requirements, because rather
typical uncertainties in shift coeﬃcients of about 10−3 cm-1/atm may lead to signiﬁcant

residues in the retrieval of atmospheric spectra [11].

The shifting of ozone rovibrational transitions has been studied both experimen-

2

tally [12–17] and theoretically [8, 18, and references therein] mostly in the ν1, ν2,
ν1 + ν3, ν1 + ν2 + ν3, and 3ν3 vibrational bands. For an extensive review of these mea-

surements up to 1998 readers are referred to Ref. [8]. Interestingly, line shifts in the

ν3 band of ozone have only been studied non-systematically such that values for just

10 lines are reported in the literature [12, 13, 16]. Due to the lack of experimental

data, shift parameters for ν3 lines in the spectroscopic databases are lacking or must be

based on some form of extrapolation from data in other bands. At present, all transi-
tions belonging to this band have shift parameters arbitrarily set to δ = −7 · 10−4 cm-1/
atm in HITRAN [19] or to δ = 0 in GEISA [20] and in S&MPO [21]. Nevertheless,

shifting parameters are vibration dependent [22], show a large variability [12–17], and

the validity of these attributions thus requires experimental veriﬁcation.

In this paper, we present experimental data of line shifts of O3 in the ν3 region in-
duced by the diﬀerent gases O2, air, He, Ar, and Xe. The results are obtained using

QCL technology, instead of the more commonly used Fourier Transform Spectroscopy

(FTS) for high-resolution spectroscopic measurements. Compared to previous line

shift studies [12–17] who mostly report the observed scatter as an estimate of the as-

sociated measurement uncertainty, we here provide a full uncertainty analysis with

metrological traceability.

We recall that SI units for line shifts are Hz/Pa, when line positions are measured
in units of frequency and we use the derived unit of kHz/Pa throughout the paper along
with values in cm-1/atm and MHz/Torr, which are the more traditional units in the
radiative transfer or physical chemistry communities. The diﬀerent units are linked to

each other by

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst present the underlying theory for the

line shift calculations, before the experimental set-up and the method are described in

the following section. Then, we present and discuss the pressure shift measurements.

In the conclusion and outlook section we ﬁnally summarize the results and propose

3

further spectroscopic applications.

2. Line shift calculation

Line shifts have been calculated using the semi-classical formalism of Robert and

Bonamy (RB, hereafter) [22]. The method, as well as the advantages of using the (RB)

formalism rather than the older Anderson-Tsao-Curnutte (ATC) theory [23, 24] is well

described by Lynch et al. [25]. Hence, we present only a short account for providing a

basic understanding and explaining the approximations made in the calculations.

The line shift δi f for the transition f ← i is calculated using the following equation:

δi f = n2 ¯v

where n2 is the perturber number density, ¯v the mean relative velocity of the two col-

liders, c the speed of light, and following the framework of the RB formalism [22], the
parabolic trajectory is described by the distance of closest approach rc and the eﬀective
velocity at this distance v(cid:48)

c, r0 being the minimum value of rc obtained for a zero impact
parameter. (cid:104). . . (cid:105)2 means an average over the rotational states of the perturber, (cid:60) means

real part, and S1 and S2 are the usual scattering terms depending on the intermolecular

potential including electrostatic and atom-atom terms.

To obtain this equation, the following assumptions have been made:

• following the original paper of RB [22, see Eq. (13)], the imaginary part (cid:61)(S 2)

has been neglected. Lynch et al. [25] have shown that this can lead to an error of

about 10 % in the case of N2 broadening of water lines.

The S 1 term has been calculated using the ionization potentials listed in the CRC hand-

book of physics and chemistry [27]. Rare gas polarizabilities and those of N2 and O2

are also given in the CRC handbook [27]. The vibrationally dependent dipole moment

and polarizability of ozone have respectively been taken from Refs. [28] and [18]. For

convenience, we summarize the values of the molecular parameters used in the calcu-

lations in Table 1. Atom-atom interaction parameters are listed separately in Table 2.

3. Experimental setup

Figure 1 shows a scheme of the experimental setup, emphasizing on the optical

components. Our electromagnetic source is a distributed feedback quantum cascade

laser (DFB-QCL, Alpes Laser), centered at 1049 cm−1 (9.54 µm) and covering the

spectral between 1046.2 and 1053.1 cm-1. The QCL operates at temperatures ranging
from −25 to +20 ◦C at a maximum current of 1.48 A. The threshold current changes
from 0.88 A at −25 ◦C to 1.31 A at +20 ◦C. The QCL is driven by a home-made, low-

noise stabilized current source while temperature is stabilized to better than ±0.1 K

using a Peltier module controlled by a thermoelectric cooler (TC-3, Alpes Laser). Heat

generated by the Peltier element is dumped into a closed-circuit water chiller (Ther-

moCube, Solid State cooling). Moreover, in order to minimize the thermal resistance
and to allow eﬃcient dissipation of heat, the laser housing is ﬁxed on a monolithic cop-

per support which is screwed on the optical table. Under typical operation conditions
of T = −10 ◦C and I = 1.3 A, the QCL emits a power of ∼ 25 mW. It has a tuning rate
of dν/dI ∼ 5.6 · 10−3 cm−1/mA or 170 MHz/mA.

The output of the QCL can be split by a removable 50-50% ZnSe beamsplitter (BS)

and sent to the Fabry-P´erot etalon (used for calibration measurements) and, through a

ﬁxed BS, to two absorption cells. The cylindrical absorption cell, which serves as a

reference cell (see Figure 1), is made of glass onto which two wedged BaF2 windows

are glued. Attached to the cell is a glass ﬁnger (not shown in Figure 1) that can be used

7

as cold trap for the storage of liquid ozone. The cell has a base length of 15 cm and a

diameter of 25 mm.

The second absorption cell (denoted ”measurement cell” in Figure 1) is a cylindric

Teﬂon coated stainless steel cell mounted on two ceramics feet. The roughly 40 cm

long and 50 mm diameter cell is positioned in an insulating aluminum box. Both, the
cell and the box, are equipped with wedged (angle 0.5◦) BaF2 windows on either side.

Each BaF2 window decreases the beam power by about 6 %. The presence of a slight
wedge allows to minimize accidental etalon eﬀects. The cell temperature is measured

through seven Pt100 RTDs (platinum resistance temperature detectors) integrated into

the metallic cell body at ∼ 1 cm from the inner wall surface.

Both cells are connected to the ozone production system (O3-PS) via two glass-

metal transitions. Similar ozone systems have been described elsewhere [33, 34] and

we give only a very short account here. Brieﬂy, the all-glass system is made of Pyrex,

mostly tubing with 8 mm inner diameter. It connects through three glass-metal tran-
sitions to the oil-free turbo molecular pump (TSU 180 H, Pfeiﬀer) that is backed up

by an oil-free membrane pump (MD-4, Vacuubrand), to the oxygen supply, and to two

capacitive pressure transducers. The lower pressure range is covered by a temperature

stabilized 10 Torr head (MKS 690A), the higher range by a non-stabilized 1000 hPa

sensor (MKS 122A). Valves are all glass with Teﬂon ﬁttings (Glass Expansion).

Ozone is generated from oxygen with purity of 99.9995 % (Alphagaz 2, Air Liq-

uide) in the discharge reactor, by adhering to the following procedure: First, the oxygen

gas is added to the reactor volume. Then, the lower part of the reactor including the

electrodes are immersed into LN2 and a RF discharge is maintained until the pressure

has decreased by about 50 % due to ozone condensing on the reactor walls. Finally,

the remaining oxygen is pumped away, before the LN2 bath is removed to release the

condensed ozone into the gas phase. The base pressure in the two cells is ∼ 1 mPa and

is controlled through the temperature stabilized pressure transducer.

The output beams from the two cells are focused onto LN2-cooled HgCdTe de-

tectors (Infrared Associates, AeroLaser) making use of two ZnSe lenses. The photo-

currents of the two detectors are pre-ampliﬁed by transimpedance ampliﬁers, then mea-

sured with two lock-in ampliﬁers (SR830, Stanford Research Systems).

8

Figure 2: Second harmonic spectra showing the pressure shift of an ozone line at three diﬀerent pressures of

Ar (0, 3 and 26 mbar).

The measurements have been performed using the frequency modulation technique

and recording the second derivatives of the signals, as shown in Figure 2 for the case
of O3-Ar measurements. Shifts are obtained as diﬀerences in the minima of the sec-

ond derivatives. The frequency modulation and the necessity to sweep over a large

spectral region containing the target lines, requires to add the sum of a rapid sine-wave

modulation and a slow linear voltage ramp to the laser’s base current. The linear ramp

is created by a multi purpose data acquisition card (DAQ PCI-6281, National Instru-

ments) onboard a PC. The sine-wave modulating signal (at 8.45 kHz) is generated by

one of the lock-in ampliﬁers. Output signals of the lock-in ampliﬁers are then recorded

by the same DAQ card.

For deﬁning the frequency scale, we use ozone absorption lines together with the

signal of a Fabry-P´erot interferometer (FP in Figure 1) with a free spectral range of

240 MHz (8.0 · 10−3 cm-1).

3.1. Experimental methods

For the shift measurements, we ﬁll the reference cell with ∼ (47 ± 20) Pa of pure

ozone. In a trap of the O3-PS, we mix a ﬁxed amount of ozone with the perturber gas

(PG, hereafter). The measurement cell is ﬁlled with this mixture through an adiabatic

9

expansion. Once both cells are loaded, second derivative spectra are acquired contin-
uously and the time diﬀerence between second derivative peaks is calculated using a

homemade Labview routine.

A pair of spectra centered at the target line was acquired at a rate of 1 Hz, due

to a triangular sweep at the same frequency. Between 200 and 600 individual spectra

were used to determine the average pressure induced time shift in the peak position,

corresponding to acquisition times between 100 and 300 s for one data point. The time
diﬀerence is then converted into a frequency shift using separate calibration measure-

ments based on FP etalon spectra.

Once the measurement has been performed for a given initial pressure, we partially

empty the measurement cell and repeat the measurements at a lower pressure. This

method, which avoids waste, has been employed with the more expensive perturber

gases, such as He and Xe. With Ar, O2 and air, the cell is completely evacuated and

reﬁlled after a run, such that the amount of ozone remains constant, and only the quan-

tity of PG is changed. Evidently, the second method has the advantage of keeping the

ozone amount constant from one measurement run to the next.

The ozone partial pressure being varied proportional to the total pressure in the

the ﬁrst acquisition method, however. Since we keep the ozone mixing ratio χ =

Perturber gases (PG) were used without further puriﬁcation and had manufacturer
(Air Liquide) certiﬁed impurities of less than 5 µmol/mol (He, Xe, O2, and synthetic

N2 and 21 % of O2.

4. Results

4.1. Line selection

The ν3 band of ozone at 10 µm is the strongest fundamental and the ozone spectrum

is particularly dense in the spectral region tuned by our QCL (see Figure 3). The bot-

tom panel of Figure 3 gives a zoom on the four lines for which we have measured the

pressure shift. These lines have been chosen according to several criteria. First, lines

were required to be free from interferences with other transitions. The interference be-
tween diﬀerent transitions is a critical issue, especially at high pressures when pressure

induced broadening leads to line overlapping and thus to changes of the observed line

shapes, which impact the determination of the line center position.

Second, lines with diﬀerent “local quanta” had been selected and the numbers are

smaller than in the previous studies. This choice is important for probing a possible

quantum number dependence of the pressure shift. Both criteria are well satisﬁed by

the four lines marked A, B, C and D in Tables 3 and 4. For each of these lines, we

list vacuum wavenumber, local quanta and measured pressure shift. As a comparison,

previously measured line data [12, 13, 16] are also given in the same Table 3. Note that

we have included line D in our study despite its relative weak absorption, because it

has been investigated in the past [16].

4.2. Uncertainty budget

The shift coeﬃcients are obtained from a linear ﬁt of shift (or adjusted shifts) ver-

sus bath gas or total pressure. Uncertainties of pressure and wavenumber shifts were

determined independently and the uncertainty has then been obtained from weighted

ﬁts with errors in both coordinates, using a total least squares algorithm that allows to

introduce correlated uncertainty values [35]. The implementation of the ﬁt algorithm

and its performance have been discussed elsewhere [6].

4.2.1. Pressure

Uncertainties in the pressure measurements have either been determined from man-

ufacturer speciﬁcations that were veriﬁed using accepted procedures, or the pressure

gauge has been calibrated over the relevant pressure range against traceable references.

The manufacturer speciﬁed accuracies for the high pressure sensor (13 − 1000 hPa)
with a nominal accuracy of 0.5 % take into account oﬀset and gain drifts, non-linearity

and hysteresis as well as the instrument resolution. The impact of ambient temperature

variations, which have been kept within ±1 K at the reference temperature of 20 ◦C,

has also been considered according to the manufacturer speciﬁcations. Assuming a

rectangular probability distribution of the manufacturer data, the corresponding stan-

dard measurement uncertainty has been derived from multiplication with the factor of

√

1/

3:

ug(p) = 15 Pa + 3.3 · 10−3 p.

(10)

The gauge has been calibrated at 1000 hPa using a traceable high precision barometer

(PTB210, Vaisala, u(p) ≤ 5 Pa) and the gauge linearity has been veriﬁed through a

series of adiabatic expansions. In this way, the compliance with manufacturer’s spec-

iﬁcations (Eq. 10) could be veriﬁed over the used pressure range. The second gauge,

which was used for quantiﬁcation of ozone partial pressures, has a nominal accuracy

of 0.08 %. It has been calibrated in-house with respect to two similar gauges (MKS690

and MKS390 with 0.08 and 0.05 % nominal accuracies, respectively) which are both

used as transfer standards that are regularly calibrated by the French national metrology

institute LNE. The derived standard uncertainty of the stabilized gauge is

ug2 (p) = 0.016 Pa + 1.1 · 10−3 p,

p ≤ 13 hPa.

(11)

14

In addition to the calibration related uncertainty, the ﬁnite resolution of the reading

must be considered, as well as the fact that the PG partial pressure is obtained as a
diﬀerence p(cid:48) = p − pm
O3

has been ﬁxed to the value of 47 Pa

(see Eq. (8)), where pm
O3

with a rectangular uncertainty distribution of ±20 Pa. Taking into account the reading

related uncertainty (at a display resolution of 0.1 hPa), we obtain therefore

u2(p(cid:48)) = u2

g(p(cid:48) + 47 Pa)) + (11.5 Pa)2 + (10 Pa)2/12.

The corresponding equation for the total pressure is

u2(p) = u2

g(p) + (10 Pa)2/12.

4.2.2. Frequency shift

(12)

(13)

Uncertainties in the frequency shift measurements derive from the calibration of

the frequency scale, the non-linear laser frequency response to the tuning current and

residual spectral etalon structures that impact the determination of the peak position

and the reproducibility of the shift measurements. All of these factors are assumed to

be independent.

The repeatability (rep) of an individual shift measurement has been determined from

repeated spectral scanning for each value in Fig. 4. From these scans, a mean value,

the standard deviation and the standard uncertainty of the mean have been derived.
The eﬀect of residual structures (fr) which persist over the time scales of a shift mea-

surement, however, cannot be estimated from the observed scatter. Its impact on the

determination of the peak position has therefore been estimated independently by in-

vestigating selected spectra under varying experimental conditions. Similar to our peak

ﬁnding algorithm, a quadratic function has been ﬁtted to the centre region of the peaks

such as shown in Fig. 2. This yielded the typical peak shape at a given pressure as well

as residual structures that were assumed to be characteristic for a given pressure, but

would change position over the time. In order to take into account slow, but unknown

changes of these structures, we have explored the variation of the ﬁtted peak position

as a function of the shift of the residual structure. By allowing continuous shifts over

several fringe periods, the following pressure dependent uncertainty has been derived

15

from the standard deviation of ﬁtted peak positions

(cid:113)

(0.06 + 0.0028p/hPa)2 + 0.062 MHz.

u f r =

(14)

This expression takes into account that residual structures also impact the determina-

tion of the reference peak. In addition to the two above contributions, a 2 % relative

uncertainty has to be considered. It takes into account the uncertainty of the frequency

calibration and slight non-linearities of the frequency scale. This results in the standard

uncertainty of a shift measurement given by

u2(∆) = u2
f r

+ u2

rep

+ (0.02∆)2

(15)

The self-shift corrected shift (see Eq. (8)) also suﬀers from the contribution through the
unknwown self shift coeﬃcient δs and the diﬀerence in ozone partial pressures. The

corresponding expression is

u2(∆(cid:48)) = u2
f r

+ u2

rep

+ (0.02∆(cid:48))2 + 267δ2

s Pa2.

(16)

For illustration purposes, we consider conservative values of δs in the range between
−0.5 and −1.5 kHz/Pa, on the basis that self broading parameters are a few tens of
percent larger than air broadening parameters. Even a value as large as −1.5 kHz/Pa

implies an uncertainty related to the last term in Eq. (16) of only 0.024 MHz. This
must be compared to other contributions to u(∆(cid:48)), such as u f r, which varies between

0.089 and 0.26 MHz over the relevant pressure range between 2 and 70 hPa. Taking a
more typical value of δs = −1.0 kHz/Pa, the self shift contribution is at least 4.5 times

smaller than other terms and can thus almost be neglected in the quadratic addition.

4.2.3. Slope modiﬁcation factor

Method 1 measurements on He and Xe (see Eq. 9) retrieve a slope a that slightly

deviates from the shift parameter. The modiﬁcation can be ascribed to the constant

factor

m = 1 − χ

1 −

(cid:33)

,

δs
δg

(17)

where χ denotes the ozone mixing ratio. For the Xe measurements χ = 8 · 10−3 has

been determined from independent pressure measurements. Assuming 1 ≤ δs/δg ≤ 2,

16

we obtain

m = 1.004 ± 0.003

(18)

wich needs to be taken into account when determining the shift coeﬃcient from δg =

a/m.

4.3. Correlations

Correlations impact on uncertainties derived from the linear ﬁt of shift versus pres-
sure. Here we give correlaion coeﬃcients between x-values, y-values and diﬀerent x-y

pairs, from which the covariance matrix for the weighting of the linear ﬁt can be set

up. For a more detailed discussion, we refer to Ref. [6].

4.3.1. First method: He and Xe

Pressure readings p are likely correlated through calibration errors [6]. We conser-

vatively assume

r(pi, p j) =

ug(pi)ug(p j)
u(pi)u(p j)

(19)

for runs at diﬀerent pressures pi and p j. Individual shift measurements are clearly cor-

related by the scaling error. Residual structures may also lead to correlation between
diﬀerent measurements of the line shift. Without further detailed information, we as-
sume a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.5 for this particular contribution. This leads to the

overall expression

r(∆i, ∆ j) =

4 · 10−4∆i∆ j + 0.5 · u f r(∆i)u f r(∆ j)
u(∆i)u(∆ j)

for diﬀerent measurements i, j of the shift.

4.3.2. Second method: Ar, O2, and air

As before, we conservatively assume

r(p(cid:48)

i, p(cid:48)

j) =

ug(pi)ug(p j)
i)u(p(cid:48)
u(p(cid:48)

For calculation of the last two terms, the self pressure broadening parameter has been
approximated by δs = −1.0 kHz/Pa.

5. Discussion

5.1. Bathgas dependence

Figure 3 shows the experimental results obtained for the four lines marked in Ta-
ble 3. Data are obtained using ﬁve diﬀerent perturber gases: O2, air, He, Ar, and Xe.

For He, only pressure shifts of lines C and D are presented in Table 3, because shifts of

the other two lines gave values comparable to the error bars. We have thus also omitted
to show a graph of ∆(He). The pressures of the perturber gases were chosen depending

on the experimental conditions, but generally spanned the 2 to 70 hPa pressure range.

As can be seen from Table 3, the four lines studied in the present work all show a

negative shift as a function of pressure and the size of the shift strongly depends on the
nature of the perturber. For example, line C presents shift parameters of −0.13 kHz/Pa
for He, −0.72 kHz/Pa for Ar, and −0.98 kHz/Pa for Xe. This bath gas dependence

of |δ(He)| < |δ(Ar)| < |δ(Xe)| has been observed for all lines, as listed in Table 3.

Such a behaviour has already been observed using molecules other than ozone, such as

HCl [36], CO [37], H2 [38], and HBr or HI [39] and is conﬁrmed by our semiclassical

calculations using the lowest order expression of the complex RB formalism [25].

5.2. Air-shifts

Our measurements of δ(air) of lines A− D range from −0.50 to −0.69 kHz/Pa, while
values of δ(O2) are between −0.54 and −0.60 kHz/Pa, as can be inferred from Table 3.

In order to compare with other studies, we have estimated the pressure shift induced

by N2 molecules by assuming a simple additive law between O2 and N2 shifts:

δ(N2) = δ(air) − 0.21δ(O2)

0.79

.

(24)

18

It must be noted that based on their measurements at 3 µm Smith et al. [17] caution

against this assumption. Given the scatter of these data, however, it is somewhat unclear

whether this observation is really signiﬁcant, especially because pressure broadening

parameters observed in the same study actually comply with the additivity rule. We

notice that our results are comparable with the FTS measurements of Smith et al. [12,

13], but do not seem to agree with the photoacoustic laser study of Sokabe et al. [16]:

Line D presents a pressure shift four times the size of our result and the sole P-branch

transition at 1037.43368 cm-1shows a positive shift. Despite not having measured in the

P-branch, a direct comparison with these results is also complicated by the fact that the

authors did not report uncertainty values for their measurements. Therefore, and due

to the fact that all other measurements using air or N2 not only have lower values than

Ref. [16], but are also much closer to our results, especially if assigned uncertainties
are in the 0.1 kHz/Pa range or lower (see Table 3 and Figure 5), we have excluded

the results of Sokabe et al. in the following discussion. Note that without identifying

neither the vibrational band nor the individual transitions, Sokabe et al. [16] measure
shifts between 0 and −0.9 kHz/Pa (or 0 and −0.003 cm-1/atm) for the vast majority of

lines reported in Ref. [12]. This seems to be largely compatible with our result and the

measurements in Refs. [12] and [13].

As already laid out in Section 4.1, one of the criteria for selecting lines was the

ability to span a signiﬁcant range of rotational quantum numbers. Quantum numbers

of J(cid:48)(cid:48) between 8 and 50 and K(cid:48)(cid:48)

c between 7 and 47 are now comprised when we include

previous FTS measurements [12, 13] in the analysis. Figure 5 shows the air shift coef-

ﬁcients listed in Table 3 as functions of J(cid:48)(cid:48). We observe a general increase in absolute
values of pressure shift coeﬃcients as rotational quantum numbers increase. Solid lines

shown in Figure 5 represent linear ﬁts to experimental and calculated results. With

the exception of the two transitions (23, 3, 20) ← (22, 1, 21) at 1080.26098 cm-1and
(37, 4, 33) ← (36, 2, 34) at 1096.07705 cm-1, that suﬀer from relatively high measure-

ment uncertainties when compared to the remainder of the data, the general linear trend
is quite well followed. Note that the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient r for the linear ﬁt

is ∼ −0.2 when all lines are admitted to the ﬁt, and ∼ −0.5 when these two lines are

excluded. Results of these ﬁts can be used to estimate the rotational quantum number

19

dependence of the pressure shift. We obtain

δ/(kHz/Pa) = −0.45(12) − 0.008(3) · J(cid:48)(cid:48)

or

δ/(10−3cm−1/atm) = −1.5(4) − 0.027(11) · J(cid:48)(cid:48)

(25)

when a unweighted ﬁt is made through all data except the two above points. Numbers in

parentheses give standard deviations in units of the last digit obtained from the present

least-squares analysis. A very similar result is obtained from a weighted ﬁt to all data
points. The fact that shifts are negative and that the eﬀect increases in magnitude with

increasing quantum number has already been observed in other bands (Fig. 6) and this

is now conﬁrmed for the R-branch of the ν3 fundamental [8, 12–18]. Fig. 6 also implies

that the magnitude of the shift increases with vibrational excitation.

Fig. 5 gives shift coeﬃcients in cm-1/atm, from which it might be inferred that the
average shift in the R-branch of the ν3 band is −2.8 · 10−3 cm-1/atm (−0.84 kHz/Pa)
when all data are included (see Table 5). One obtains −2.5 · 10−3 cm-1/atm if the

(23, 3, 20) ← (22, 1, 21) and (37, 4, 33) ← (36, 2, 34) transitions are neglected or if

a weighted average of all data points is taken. The derived numbers can thus be seen
as representative. While our analysis certainly suﬀers from a small number of data
points, it already suggests that typical shift coeﬃcients for atmospheric applications
are between −2 and −3 · 10−3 cm-1/atm, and thus are about four times larger than

the current recommendation in the HITRAN2016 database, which proposes a value
of −0.7 · 10−3 cm-1/atm for all transitions belonging to the ozone ν3-band. A unique
value of δ = −3 · 10−3 cm-1/atm, or better the linear relation in Eq. (25), is much more

representative, at least as far as R-branch transitions are concerned. The data also imply

a slight and global J dependence, as found for other bands (see Table 5 or Fig. 6). It

would thus be even more appropriate to take include this dependence into the databases.

6. Summary and Outlook

We have measured the pressure shifts of ozone molecular lines using a free-running
distributed-feedback QCL emitting at 9.54 µm. The pressure shift coeﬃcients of four

intense rovibrational transitions in the R-branch of the ν3 fundamental band of ozone,

20

induced by O2, air and the noble gases He, Ar, and Xe could be obtained. Negative
pressure-shift coeﬃcients have been found with values ranging between −0.11 and
−0.13 kHz/Pa for He, between −0.54 and −0.72 kHz/Pa for Ar, and between −0.82
and −0.98 kHz/Pa for Xe. This ﬁnding corresponds to the usual correlation with the

polarizability of the perturber gas, as conﬁrmed by a simple calculation using the semi-

classical formalism of Robert and Bonamy.

Air and oxygen resulted in pressure shift coeﬃcients between −0.50 and −0.69 kHz/Pa.

These values are close to previous results [12, 13] for other transitions in the same

branch of the ν3 band. With the four new low J and K transitions, the available data now
span the range between 8 and 50 in J(cid:48)(cid:48) and from 7 to 47 in K(cid:48)(cid:48)
c , allowing to derive an
empirical correlation between the shift coeﬃcient and these quantum numbers. While
suﬀering from a small number of data points, the analysis already suggests that shift co-
eﬃcients for atmospheric applications are close to −3·10−3 cm-1/atm, and thus are about
four times larger than the current recommendation at −0.7 · 10−3 cm-1/atm. A unique
value of δ = − · 10−3 cm-1/atm, or even a simple linear relation δ/(10−3cm−1/atm) =
−1.5(4) − 0.027(11) · J(cid:48)(cid:48), are much more representative for transitions in the ν3 band,
especially for the R-branch which has been reviewed here. A negative J(cid:48)(cid:48) dependence

of similar magnitude is also found using the simple semiclassical RB approach.

A systematic study using the present technique would be very useful to make up

for the lack of shift parameters for ν3 lines of ozone. This seems to be an urgent matter

as not even a single line in the P-branch has been measured as of today and as only one
line of the Q-branch has a shift coeﬃcient associated so far. An obvious extension of

the current work is the study of the temperature dependence of shift parameters or the
inclusion of diﬀerent isotopomers, such as in [40].

A subsequent stabilization of the QCL onto an optical frequency comb, which is

intended for the very near future, will open up the possibility to perform metrological

measurements of Doppler-free molecular lines and thus greatly enhance the sensitivity

and accuracy of the measurements. As a consequence, much weaker lines will be-

come accessible and the pressure shifting in the intense ν3-band can be studied more

systematically.

(green triangles), and this work (violet circles). The dashed line on top indicates the current recommendation
(HITRAN2016, [19]). Black open circles are calulated shift coeﬃcients in this work. The red and black solid

lines respectively indicate a weighted linear ﬁt to the measurements and a simple linear ﬁt to the calculated

Panels are arranged in order of increasing energy (left to right) and number of vibrational quanta (bottom to
top). ν1: [12]; ν2: [14]; ν3: this work, [12], [13]; ν1 + ν3: N2 (circles) and O2 (squares) [15], ; ν1 + ν2 + ν3:
[17]; 3ν3: [17]. Fit lines were obtained by direct ﬁt to the data, except for the ν1 and the ν1 + ν3 bands. For
ν1 + ν3, N2 and O2 were ﬁtted separately and then combined using respective abundance weights of 0.79 and

0.21.
