Dark matter with Planck-scale mass ((cid:39) 1019 GeV/c2) arises in well-motivated theories and could
be produced by several cosmological mechanisms. A search for multi-scatter signals from supermas-
sive dark matter was performed with a blind analysis of data collected over a 813 d live time with
DEAP-3600, a 3.3 t single-phase liquid argon-based detector at SNOLAB. No candidate signals were
observed, leading to the ﬁrst direct detection constraints on Planck-scale mass dark matter. Leading
limits constrain dark matter masses between 8.3 × 106 and 1.2 × 1019 GeV/c2, and 40Ar-scattering
cross sections between 1.0 × 10−23 and 2.4 × 10−18 cm2. These results are interpreted as constraints
on composite dark matter models with two diﬀerent nucleon-to-nuclear cross section scalings.

 
 
 
 
 
 
I.

INTRODUCTION

all PMTs is quantiﬁed with Fprompt, as in Ref. [33],

Despite the abundance of dark matter (DM) [1],
little is known about its particle nature. While
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) of
electroweak masses and possible thermal origin are
promising candidates and are the subject of several
recent searches (e.g. Refs. [2–8], also Ref. [9]), other
well-motivated candidates span many orders of mag-
nitude in mass and may evade current constraints.
DM with Planck-scale mass (mχ (cid:39) 1019 GeV/c2)
may be produced non-thermally, such as in inﬂaton
decay or gravitational mechanisms related to inﬂa-
tion [10–14], often related to Grand Uniﬁed Theories
(GUTs). Other models describe super-heavy DM
produced by primordial black hole radiation [15] or
extended thermal production in a dark sector [16].
Direct detection constraints at these masses are
limited by the DM number density rather than the
cross section. As a result, even large cross sec-
tions permitting multiple scatters remain uncon-
strained. While the ﬁnite overburden may allow
suﬃciently massive particles to be detected under-
ground [17], typical WIMP analyses that reject
pileup and multiple-scatter signatures cannot be ex-
trapolated to these high cross sections. Instead, ded-
icated analyses are required [17–19], which can probe
a variety of theoretical scenarios giving super-heavy,
stable, and strongly interacting states [18, 20–25].

Previous direct detection searches constrain DM
with mχ (cid:46) 6 × 1017 GeV/c2 [26–30]. The present
study uses data taken with DEAP-3600, 2 km under-
ground at SNOLAB, to probe mχ up to the Planck
scale using multiple-scatter signals, placing the ﬁrst
direct detection constraints at these masses.

II. DETECTOR, EVENT
RECONSTRUCTION & DATA SET

DEAP-3600 contains (3279 ± 96) kg LAr in a
spherical acrylic vessel (AV) with inner surface
area 9.1 m2, viewed by 255 photomultiplier tubes
(PMTs), submerged in a water Cherenkov muon
veto (MV). Additional details are described in
Refs. [31, 32]. The data acquisition and WIMP
search analysis are described in Refs. [2, 33].

Energy depositions are measured by counting pho-
toelectrons (PEs) in the PMTs resulting from LAr
scintillation. PEs are measured by charge-division,
as in Ref. [33], rather than the Bayesian algorithm
in Ref. [2], as the energies and event topologies of
interest extend beyond the latter’s validation range.

Fprompt =

(cid:82) 10 000 ns

.

(1)

Fprompt discriminates single-scatter electronic and
nuclear recoils [34] and decreases with the number
of scatters, separating single- and multiple-scatters
with increasing eﬃciency at high cross sections.

A second discriminator Npeaks is calculated with
a peak-ﬁnding algorithm based on the waveforms’
slope and identiﬁes coincident scintillation pulses
in a 10 µs window. This algorithm best identiﬁes
multiple-scatter events when the scatters are spread
out in time and produce well-separated peaks.

To reduce the volume of data written to disk due
to the (3.3 ± 0.3) kBq of 39Ar [2, 35], a “pre-scale”
region is deﬁned at low Fprompt for 50–565 keVee en-
ergies. Only trigger-level information is recorded for
99 % of such events, limiting sensitivity to the lowest
cross sections of interest in the present analysis.

This search uses a blind analysis of (813 ± 8) live-
days of data collected between November 4, 2016
and March 8, 2020, excluding (3 ± 3) µs/trigger to
account for DM signals that may be divided be-
tween two recorded traces, a 9 d open physics run,
and a 6 d muon-coincidence sideband, composed of
events within [−10, 90] µs of MV triggers. These
open datasets informed the background model and
cuts, which were frozen prior to unblinding.

III. SIMULATION

DM is simulated via Monte Carlo with the RAT
software [36], built upon Geant4 [37], in two steps:
1) it is attenuated in the overburden, 2) it is propa-
gated in the detector, simulating optical and data ac-
quisition (DAQ) responses. DM is generated 80 km
above the Earth’s surface with the Standard Halo
Model velocity distribution [38–44] and propagated
through the Earth to a 1.5 m shell surrounding the
AV. DM is boosted into the detector’s reference
frame for a randomized date, following Refs. [28, 45].
Assuming continuous energy loss, the attenuation
of DM at position (cid:126)r is calculated numerically as [18]

where mχ and mi are the DM and nucleus mass,
respectively, and dσi,χ/dER is the model-dependent
diﬀerential scattering cross section (see Sec. V).

The atmospheric density proﬁle is taken from
Ref. [46], composed of 79 % N2 and 21 % O2, and
the Earth’s density proﬁle and composition are from
Refs. [47, 48]. Uncertainties in the Earth and atmo-
sphere models negligibly aﬀect the present study.

DM is then propagated through DEAP-3600. The
detector response is calibrated up to 10 MeVee using
(n, γ) lines from an 241AmBe source, giving a factor
of 0.9 ± 0.1 used to scale the simulated PE response.
Fig. 1 shows two simulated PE time distributions.
At lower nuclear scattering cross sections (denoted
σTχ), Npeaks counts peaks from individual scatters,
which merge at higher σTχ, causing it to lose accu-
racy. In this regime, the signal energy and duration,
typically <6 µs, depend on the DM speed and track

length in LAr, making Fprompt an estimate of the
fraction of scatters in a 150 ns window around the
start of the signal, which decreases at higher σTχ.

Near σTχ (cid:39) 10−23 cm2, Npeaks grows with increas-
ing σTχ as the DM scatters more times. As peaks
merge, Npeaks decreases with σTχ, as seen in Fig. 2.
However, Fprompt also decreases and narrows as σTχ
grows. For the simulated σTχ, overburden eﬀects
have a negligible impact on the DM signal above
1012 GeV/c2 and become signiﬁcant at lower mχ.

IV. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

To identify DM over a wide range of energies and
scattering lengths, four regions of interest (ROIs) are
deﬁned with diﬀerent cuts on Npeaks and Fprompt,
summarized in Tab. I. Cuts for ROIs 1–3 mitigate
pileup backgrounds that are negligible in ROI 4,
which uses minimal cuts that can be evaluated with-
out the full simulation. Doing this allows for con-
straints on DM-nucleon scattering cross sections σnχ
that are computationally prohibitive to simulate.

rejecting events in a [−10, 90] µs window surrounding each MV trigger is applied to all ROIs; low-level cuts requiring
that signals be consistent with bulk LAr scintillation are applied to ROIs 1–3. The upper energy bound on ROI 4 is
estimated assuming a constant light yield above 10 MeVee, the highest energy at which the detector is calibrated.

A. Backgrounds and selection cuts

The primary backgrounds come from uncorrelated
pileup of signals produced by radioactivity in de-
tector materials, described in Ref. [35]. Correlated
backgrounds, such as 212Po α-decays following 212Bi
β-decays with a 300 ns half-life, are removed by re-
quiring Npeaks >2 for all energies they may populate.
Pileup was modeled by simulation, validated with
a 3.8 h calibration run with an 241AmBe source,
which emits neutrons at a (4.6 ± 0.7) kHz rate, and
with a 9 d non-blind physics run, testing pileup
reconstruction for Npeaks ≤4 up to 7.4 MeV and
Npeaks ≤5 up to 2.6 MeV. Simulated Npeaks distribu-
tions agreed to within 5 % in both datasets. ROI 4
relies solely on Fprompt for multi-scatter detection,
since Npeaks could not be tested at these energies.

Two low-level cuts in ROIs 1–3 ensure signals
are from bulk LAr scintillation: <5 % of PE must
be in PMTs in gaseous Ar, with a DM acceptance
of (99.1 ± 0.1) %, and <5 % of PE must be in the
brightest channel, with a (86.5 ± 0.3) % acceptance.
The dominant backgrounds in ROIs 1–3 are from
pileup. Pileup rates decrease with energy, allowing
the Npeaks threshold to accommodate the decreasing
accuracy at higher cross sections. Pileup is negligi-
ble in ROI 4, where muons produce the dominant
backgrounds. Muons are tagged by the veto. Un-
tagged muons are rejected by the Fprompt cut, tuned
on the muon-coincidence dataset. The background
expectation is determined using the ﬂux in Ref. [49].
Tab. I summarizes cuts and backgrounds in each
ROI, deﬁned by the PE range. Energies are provided
for illustrative purposes; the listed upper bound
on ROI 4 assumes the light yield remains constant
above 10 MeVee, the maximum energy at which the
detector is calibrated. Its upper PE bound is con-
sistent with the highest scale at which the DAQ sys-
tem’s performance was tested using calibration data
collected with a light injection system. Fig. 3 shows
the probability of 1018 GeV/c2 DM reconstructing
in the PE range for each ROI and passing all cuts.

ulating each ROI and surviving all cuts at varying σTχ.

B. Results

After ﬁnalizing the selection cuts and back-
ground model with a total background expectation
of 0.05 ± 0.03 across all ROIs, the blinded dataset
was opened, revealing zero events. These null results
allow any DM model predicting more than 2.3 events
across all ROIs to be excluded at the 90 % C. L.

V. THEORETICAL INTERPRETATIONS

The DM signal and σnχ-σTχ scaling depend on the
DM model. Two composite models are considered.

and σnχ, and exclusion regions are built account-
ing for uncertainties as prescribed in Ref. [50]. Up-
per bounds on mχ are interpolated with a ρχ/mχ
ﬂux scaling; lower bounds are set to the value at
which the overburden calculation predicts that 90 %
of expected DM signals will be below 1 MeVee after
quenching. Upper bounds on σnχ are set by the low-
est simulated values that that can be excluded, while
lower bounds are limited by the highest σnχ that
were computationally possible to simulate, σmax
nχ . At
higher σnχ, the continuous scattering approximation
and the time-of-ﬂight in LAr imply a lower bound on
the ROI 4 acceptance of 35 %. Conservatively treat-
ing the probability of reconstructing in ROI 4 as
constant above σmax
nχ and scaling the ﬂux as ρχ/mχ,
exclusion regions are extrapolated to mχ consistent
with null results. Upper bounds on σnχ are set to

that the scattering cross section at zero momentum

where FT(q) is the Helm form factor [55, 56]. This
scaling may give conservative limits for strongly in-
teracting composite DM [57]. The region excluded
for this model is shown in Fig. 4 (top). Here (and in
the bottom panel) the lower and upper boundaries
are ﬂat because, unlike in WIMP searches where
these exclusion σTχ ∝ mD at high DM masses, the
cross section sensitivity is only dependent on the
detector’s multi-scatter acceptance. The right-hand
boundary is nearly vertical due to the drop in DM
ﬂux with increasing mD; above the notch is the re-
gion where the Earth overburden is dominated by
the crust. On the left-hand boundary σTχ ∝ mD
due to attenuation in the overburden.

VI. SUMMARY AND SCOPE

This study uses DEAP-3600 data to derive new
constraints on composite DM, including the ﬁrst di-
rect detection results probing Planck-scale masses.
These constraints were obtained through a dedicated
analysis of multiple-scatter signals, accounting for
the attenuation that the DM would experience in
the laboratory’s overburden. The analysis used to
achieve these results represents the ﬁrst study of this
kind in a tonne-scale direct detection experiment,
extending Planck-scale limits from ancient mica [54]
and etched plastic studies [51] to lower cross sections.
The high-mass sensitivity achieved by DEAP-3600
was possible due to its large cross sectional area,
which provides a large net to catch dilute DM. As
a result, limits were placed on two classes of DM
models describing strongly interacting, opaque com-
posites and dark nuclei motivated by the QCD scale
with a spherical top-hat potential.

This analysis may be extended to superheavy DM
depositing energy via modes other than elastic scat-
tering, (e.g. Ref. [25]), to future LAr, liquid xenon,
and bubble chamber detectors, and to large-scale
liquid scintillator (e.g. SNO+, JUNO) [18] and seg-
mented detectors (e.g. MATHUSLA) [19].
