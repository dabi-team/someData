MINI-FILAMENT ERUPTIONS TRIGGERING CONFINED SOLAR FLARES
OBSERVED BY ONSET AND SDO

ApJL, accepted 2018 June 5

ABSTRACT
Using the observations from the Optical and Near-infrared Solar Eruption Tracer and the Solar
Dynamics Observatory, we study an M5.7 ﬂare in AR 11476 on 2012 May 10 and a micro-ﬂare in the
quiet Sun on 2017 March 23. Before the onset of each ﬂare, there is a reverse S-shaped ﬁlament above
the polarity inversion line. Then the ﬁlaments become unstable and begin to rise. The rising ﬁlaments
gain the upper hand over the tension force of the dome-like overlying loops and thus successfully
erupt outward. The footpoints of the reconnecting overlying loops successively brighten and are
observed as two ﬂare ribbons, while the newly formed low-lying loops appear as the post-ﬂare loops.
These eruptions are similar to the classical model of successful ﬁlament eruptions associated with
coronal mass ejections. However, the erupting ﬁlaments in this study move along large-scale lines and
eventually reach the remote solar surface, i.e., no ﬁlament material is ejected into the interplanetary
space. Thus both the ﬂares are conﬁned ones. These results reveal that some successful ﬁlament
eruptions can trigger conﬁned ﬂares. Our observations also imply that this kind of ﬁlament eruptions
may be ubiquitous on the Sun, from active regions with large ﬂares to the quiet Sun with micro-ﬂares.

1. INTRODUCTION
Solar ﬂares, suddenly releasing a large amount of mag-
netic energy, are one of the most energetic phenomena on
the Sun (Priest & Forbes 2002; Janvier et al. 2015; Yang
et al. 2017). Solar ﬁlaments are deemed to play a crucial
role in the initiation of solar ﬂares. For the onset of ﬁla-
ment eruptions, several diﬀerent mechanisms have been
proposed and studied, such as kink instability, torus in-
stability, ﬂux emergence and cancellation, tether cutting
reconnection, breakout reconnection (e.g., Antiochos et
al. 1999; Chen & Shibata 2000; Zhang et al. 2001; T¨or¨ok
& Kliem 2005; Chen et al. 2016; Wyper et al. 2017). In
the popular ﬂare model and relevant observations, a ris-
ing ﬁlament stretches the overlying magnetic ﬁeld lines,
creating a current sheet between the anti-parallel ﬁeld
lines where magnetic reconnection takes place, and then
a bulk of plasma and magnetic structure is ejected into
the interplanetary space, forming a coronal mass ejection
(CME; Svestka & Cliver 1992; Shibata et al. 1995; Lin
& Forbes 2000; Ding et al. 2003).

However, some ﬂares termed conﬁned ﬂares are not
accompanied by CMEs (e.g., Guo et al. 2010; Zheng et
al. 2012; Yang et al. 2014; Yan et al. 2015; Joshi et
al. 2015). The main mechanism to explain the forma-
tion of conﬁned ﬂares is the failure of ﬁlament eruptions
(Ji et al. 2003). Solar eruptions are greatly aﬀected
by the surrounding coronal structures. Simulations and
calculations reveal that the strong overlying arcades can
prevent magnetic energy release and result in conﬁned
ﬂares (T¨or¨ok & Kliem 2005; Fan & Gibson 2007; Wang
& Zhang 2007). If the decrease factor of the overlying
ﬁeld is not high enough, the eruption of the ﬁlaments will

nese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China

fail, thus forming conﬁned ﬂares. Moreover, Myers et al.
(2015) found in a laboratory experiment that, if the ten-
sion force of the guide magnetic ﬁeld is strong enough,
a torus-unstable ﬂux rope also fails to erupt. Recently,
Amari et al. (2018) studied the evolution of a ﬂux rope
with the overlying loops forming a conﬁning cage. Their
results revealed that the ﬂux rope had insuﬃcient energy
to break through the conﬁning cage even if its twist was
large enough to trigger a kink instability, resulting in a
conﬁned ﬂare. For a failed ﬁlament eruption, the ﬁla-
ment ﬁrst accelerates, then decelerates, and eventually
reaches the peak height, after which the ﬁlament drains
back to its initial location (Ji et al. 2003; Cheng et al.
2015).

In this Letter, based on the observations from the Op-
tical and Near-infrared Solar Eruption Tracer (ONSET;
Fang et al. 2013) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012), we present the analysis of two
conﬁned ﬂares associated with jet-like eruptive activity in
the closed-ﬁeld corona, referred to as conﬁned jets in the
simulations by Wyper & DeVore (2016) and Wyper et al.
(2016). ONSET, a new multi-wavelength solar telescope
of Nanjing University, is installed at Fuxian Solar Obser-
vatory in Yunnan Province of China. It can simultane-
ously image the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona
in white-light (3600 ˚A and 4250 ˚A), Hα 6562.8 ˚A, and
He I 10830 ˚A.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS
We mainly study an M5.7 ﬂare in AR 11476 on 2012
May 10 and a micro-ﬂare in the quiet Sun on 2017 March
23. The M5.7 ﬂare on 2012 May 10 was observed by ON-
SET and SDO. We use the ONSET white light 4250 ˚A
and Hα 6562.8 ˚A full-disk images between 03:45 UT and
04:27 UT. They have a cadence of 1 min and a pixel
size of about 1′′. The simultaneous SDO/Atmospheric

HMI LOS magnetogram, ONSET 4250 ˚A image, and ONSET Hα image of the area where the M5.7 ﬂare occurred. The green curve in
panel (c) represents the ﬁlament identiﬁed in the Hα image. The blue and red curves in panels (d) and (e) are the contours of the positive
and negative magnetic ﬁelds at ± 600 G, respectively.

channel images and SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Im-
ager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) line-of-sight (LOS) mag-
netograms are also adopted. The AIA UV/EUV full-disk
images have a cadence of 24/12 s and a spatial sampling
of 0.′′6 pixel−1, and the HMI LOS magnetograms have a
cadence of 45 s and a pixel size of 0.′′5. The Geostation-
ary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) data
with a 1 min cadence are used to examine the variation of
soft X-ray ﬂux. For the micro-ﬂare on 2017 March 23, we
mainly employ the AIA 304 ˚A, 171 ˚A, and 193 ˚A images
and HMI LOS magnetograms from 22:00 UT to 22:50
UT. All the AIA and HMI data are ﬁrst calibrated using
the standard routine within the Solar Software package,
and then de-rotated diﬀerentially. The reference times
of derotation for the M5.7 ﬂare and micro-ﬂare are 04:00
UT and 22:00 UT, respectively. The ONSET images are
coaligned with the SDO data by cross-correlating speciﬁc
features.

In order to study the magnetic topology of AR 11476,
we use the HMI data product called Space weather HMI
Active Region Patches (SHARP) of the photospheric vec-
tor magnetic ﬁelds. The photospheric vector magne-
togram is preprocessed with the method of Wiegelmann
et al. (2006) to best suit the force-free condition. Then
the preprocessed magnetogram is used as the bottom
boundary to reconstruct the coronal structures using the
nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) modeling (Wheatland
et al. 2000; Wiegelmann 2004). The NLFFF extrapola-
tion is performed in a box of 896×512×256 uniformly dis-
tributed grid points with ∆x = ∆y = ∆z = 0.′′5. More-
over, we calculate the twist number Tw (Berger & Prior

2006) and squashing factor Q (D´emoulin et al. 1996;
Titov et al. 2002) of the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld us-
ing the code developed by Liu et al. (2016).

3. RESULTS
The leading and trailing polarities of AR 11476 shown
in Figure 1(a) are negative and positive, respectively.
The region of interest is outlined by the green window,
which is located nearby one leg of a cluster of large-scale
coronal loops seen in 171 ˚A (panel (b)). The zoom-in
views of this region are shown in panels (c)-(e). We can
see that, in the center of the FOV, there were mainly two
magnetic concentrations with opposite polarities, form-
ing a dipolar region (panel (c)). The positive and neg-
ative patches corresponded to a pair of sunspots in the
photosphere, as seen in ONSET 4250 ˚A image (panel
(d)). In the ONSET Hα image at 03:48:56 UT, there was
a ﬁlament lying along the polarity inversion line (PIL).
This area is just the site where the M5.7 ﬂare took place.
The M5.7 ﬂare started at 04:11 UT, peaked at 04:18
UT, and ended at 04:23 UT, with the duration of 12
min, as revealed by the variation of the GOES soft X-
ray ﬂux (the white curve in Figure 2(a1). Before the
initiation of the ﬂare (e.g., at 04:01:45 UT), the state of
the ﬁlament was generally stable (see the Hα image in
panel (a1)). At 04:09:46 UT, the ﬁlament became un-
stable and began to rise, meanwhile a slight brightening
appeared beneath the ﬁlament (panel (a2). The ﬁlament
went on rising and the ﬂaring brightness increased (panel
(a3), also see the animation Movie1.mp4). Then the ﬁl-
ament erupted outward and the remote area denoted by
the white arrows brightened (panel (a4)). The erupt-

ing material moved along the trajectory outlined by the
dashed curves in panels (a5)-(a6) and reached the remote
brightening region. Due to the eruption of the ﬁlament,
two ﬂare ribbons can be clearly observed in the chromo-
sphere, as shown in AIA 1600 ˚A image (panel (b)), and
a set of post-ﬂare loops also appeared, as shown in AIA
94 ˚A image (panel (c)). In the 171 ˚A image with a large
FOV (panel (d)), the erupting material ﬂew along the
large-scale loops, from the left leg to the remote one (see
the animation Movie2.mp4).

In order to study the magnetic topology of the ﬁlament,
we analyze the vector magnetic ﬁelds at the ﬁlament lo-
cation. The HMI vector magnetogram at 03:48:00 UT is
shown in Figure 3(a). The vortex patterns of the hori-
zontal ﬁelds (blue and red arrows) at both the positive
and negative polarities indicate that the magnetic ﬁelds
are nonpotential and the ﬁeld lines are greatly twisted.
In the Q map at the photosphere (x−y plane with z = 0),
the main PIL of the magnetic ﬁelds coincides with a high
Q region (denoted by the white arrow in panel (b)), in-
dicating the existence of a quasi-separatrix layer therein.
In the NLFFF extrapolated ﬁelds, we ﬁnd there is a ﬂux

rope with Tw > 1 (indicated by the colorful wrapped lines
in panel (c)) located above the PIL. This ﬂux rope ex-
actly corresponds to the ﬁlament identiﬁed in the Hα ob-
servations. There also exist many overlying loops form-
ing a dome-like structure (see the blue lines) above the
ﬂux rope.
In the side-view of the reconstructed large-
scale coronal structures (see panel (d)), the ﬂux rope (red
curves) and overlying loops (blue ones) are surrounded
by large-scale ﬁeld lines extending upward from the posi-
tive ﬁelds and ending in the remote negative ﬁelds (green
curves). Based on the observations, we draw a cartoon
to illustrate the successful eruption of the ﬁlament and
the subsequent formation of conﬁned ﬂare, which will be
addressed in Section 4.

In the quiet Sun, the successful eruption of a mini-
ﬁlament as shown in Figure 4 led to a conﬁned micro-
ﬂare (also see the animation Movie3.mp4), similar to the
process of the M5.7 ﬂare. In the small FOV of the quiet
region (see panel (a)), the HMI LOS magnetogram at
21:59:43 UT presented a dipolar magnetic patches with
the opposite polarities saturated at ± 50 G. Along the
PIL, a reverse S-shaped mini-ﬁlament can be identiﬁed

in the 304 ˚A image (panel (b1)). At 22:05:05 UT, the ﬁl-
ament began to rise and there was a brightening beneath
the left part of the ﬁlament (see panel (b2)). Only 1 min
later, the ﬁlament lifted signiﬁcantly and the underneath
brightening was more conspicuous, triggering a micro-
ﬂare. At 22:08:05 UT, the ﬁlament erupted outward (in-
dicated by the green arrow in panel (b4)), and two obvi-
ous ﬂare ribbons (denoted by the white arrows) appeared
at the initial location of the ﬁlament. Afterward, the
material of the ﬁlament went on ﬂowing further, and the
separation of the ﬂare ribbons became larger (see panels
(b5)-(b6)). In addition, many post-ﬂare loops (indicated
by the arrow in panel (c)) connecting the two ribbons
can be well observed in AIA 171 ˚A image.

4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
With the multi-instrument observations from ONSET
and SDO, we have studied the evolution of an M5.7 ﬂare
in AR 11476 and a micro-ﬂare in the quiet Sun. For
each ﬂare, there existed a ﬁlament above the PIL at the
pre-ﬂare stage. Then the ﬁlaments became unstable and
began to rise with brightenings beneath them. The rising
ﬁlaments gained the upper hand over the tension force
of the dome-like overlying ﬁeld lines and thus erupted
successfully. Consequently, two ﬂare ribbons and many
post-ﬂare loops were formed due to the ﬁlament eruption.
The erupting ﬁlament material ﬂew outward along large-
scale lines with the other leg anchoring in the remote
area. The ﬁlament material ﬁnally reached the remote
end, and no material was ejected into the interplanetary
space. These observations are consistent – both in mag-
netic topology and overall eruption morphology – with
the simulation results from Wyper & DeVore (2016) and
Wyper et al. (2016), who referred to this kind of events
as conﬁned jets. Figure 17 in the paper of Wyper et
al. (2016) showing a synthetic emission proxy displays
exactly the kind of dynamics reported here, both from
a side-view (comparable to the M5.7 event) and a top-
down view (comparable to the quiet-Sun event).

At the pre-ﬂare stage, the large-scale coronal struc-
tures observed in AIA 193 ˚A are shown in Figure 5(a).
From the underlying photospheric magnetogram (panel
(c)), we can see that the surrounding ﬁelds of the mini-

age, there were large-scale loops anchoring nearby the
mini-ﬁlament and connecting to the remote positive ﬁelds
(outlined by dashed curves). As the ﬁlament successfully
erupted, the erupting material moved outward along the
large-scale loops, as shown in panel (b). It is especially
clearly that some ﬁlament material ﬂew along the left
loops (indicated by the left green curve in panel (b)) and
reached the end with positive ﬁelds (also see the anima-
tion Movie4.mp4).

For the M5.7 ﬂare, it was also detected in the white
light (Song et al. 2018). This ﬂare was trigged by the
ﬁlament eruption, and we use the sketch in Figure 3(e)
to describe this process. The ﬂux rope (i.e., the ﬁlament
in observation) lost its stability due to some mechanisms,

directed large-scale ﬁeld lines (indicated by the right-side
green curves). Then the rising ﬂux rope stretched the
overlying loops, and magnetic reconnection occurred at
the site marked by the star symbol. Magnetic reconnec-
tion can convert magnetic energy into thermal energy
and kinetic energy of solar plasma (Cirtain et al. 2013;

Tian et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2015). The
footpoints of the reconnecting loops successively bright-
ened and were observed as two ﬂare ribbons in AIA 1600
˚A (see Figure 2(b)). The newly formed low-lying loops
appeared as the post-ﬂare loops in AIA 94 ˚A (Figure
2(c)). Since the ﬂux rope erupted, the ﬁlament material
was ejected outward. This eruption process is consistent
with the classical model of successful ﬁlament eruption
associated with CMEs (e.g., Shibata et al. 1995; Lin &

The ﬁlament in the ﬁrst event was located in a sheared
dipolar region embraced by the ambient magnetic ﬁelds
with one polarity, which is also revealed in the Q map.
This kind of photospheric magnetic ﬁeld often corre-
sponds to the fan-spine conﬁguration in the corona,
which is favorable for the formation of circular ﬂares
(e.g., Masson et al. 2009; Wang & Liu 2012; Sun et
al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2016; Hao et al. 2017; Hernandez-
Perez et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2017). The mini-ﬁlament in
the second event had the similar morphology with the
ﬁrst ﬁlament. Most cases of this type of small-scale
eruption were often observed in coronal holes, forming
blowout jets associated with jet-like CMEs (Moore et al.
2010; Shen et al. 2012).
It implies that this kind of
ﬁlament eruptions may be ubiquitous on the Sun, from
active regions with large ﬂares to the quiet Sun with
micro-ﬂares.

According to the previous studies (e.g., Ji et al . 2003;
Cheng et al. 2015), for a failed ﬁlament eruption, the ris-
ing ﬁlament will reach a peak height and then fall back
to its initial location. However, the observed ﬁlaments

in the present study erupted outward directly and moved
along the large-scale lines continually, diﬀerent from the
behavior of failed ﬁlament eruptions. Therefore, the ﬁla-
ments erupted successfully instead of failed. Considering
that the erupting ﬁlament material eventually reached
the remote solar surface and no CME was produced, both
the ﬂares should be called conﬁned ﬂares. Our results re-
veal that some successful ﬁlament eruptions can trigger
conﬁned ﬂares.
