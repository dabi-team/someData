ABSTRACT

Quiescent ﬁlaments appear as absorption features on the solar disk when observed in
chromospheric lines and at continuum wavelengths in the millimeter (mm) range. Active region
(AR) ﬁlaments are their small-scale, low-altitude analogues, but they could not be resolved
in previous mm observations. This spectral diagnostic can provide insight into the details of
the formation and physical properties of their ﬁne threads, which are still not fully understood.
Here, we shed light on the thermal structure of an AR ﬁlament using high-resolution brightness
temperature (Tb) maps taken with ALMA Band 6 complemented by simultaneous IRIS near-UV
spectra, Hinode/SOT photospheric magnetograms, and SDO/AIA extreme-UV images. Some
of the dark threads visible in the AIA 304 ˚A passband and in the core of Mg II resonance lines
have dark (Tb < 5000 K) counterparts in the 1.25 mm maps, but their visibility signiﬁcantly varies
across the ﬁlament spine and in time. These opacity changes are possibly related to variations
in temperature and electron density in ﬁlament ﬁne structures. The coolest Tb values (< 5000 K)
coincide with regions of low integrated intensity in the Mg II h and k lines. ALMA Band 3 maps
taken after the Band 6 ones do not clearly show the ﬁlament structure, contrary to the expectation
that the contrast should increase at longer wavelengths based on previous observations of
quiescent ﬁlaments. The ALMA maps are not consistent with isothermal conditions, but the
temporal evolution of the ﬁlament may partly account for this.

Thermal structure of AR ﬁlaments

1 INTRODUCTION

Dark ﬁlaments on the solar disk and bright prominences at the limb are homologous structures ﬁlled with
cool ((cid:46) 104 K), dense plasma suspended by the Lorentz force against gravity above polarity-inversion
lines in the photosphere. They are generally separated into two categories: the larger (
100 Mm),
∼
long-lived, high-altitude (> 10 Mm) quiescent ﬁlaments and the smaller (
10 Mm), more dynamic, lower-
altitude (< 10 Mm) active region (AR) ﬁlaments. The magnetic ﬁeld in the former is essentially horizontal
3-80 G (Leroy, 1989; Casini et al., 2005; Orozco Su´arez et al., 2014), but AR
with ﬁeld strengths of
ﬁlaments may show ﬂux rope structure and ﬁeld strengths that can be an order of magnitude higher than
in the quiescent ones (Kuckein et al., 2009, 2012; Guo et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2012; D´ıaz Baso et al.,
2019). Estimates of (core) kinetic temperatures in prominences lie within the range
9 000 K for
1 (e.g., Stellmacher et al., 2003; Jejˇciˇc et al., 2018; Ruan
16 km s−
microturbulence values within
et al., 2019). While the general properties of ﬁlaments are well understood, there are open questions
pertaining to their ﬁne structure and magnetic conﬁguration (Chen et al., 2020, and references therein).
Furthermore, they may become unstable and erupt, leading to coronal mass ejections, hence their relevance
in the context of solar activity and space weather (see reviews by Parenti, 2014; Gibson, 2018).

Observational studies have mainly used spectral lines such as Ly α, H α, Ca II H, 8542 ˚A, He I D3,
10830 ˚A, and He II 304 ˚A to investigate prominence/ﬁlament thermodynamics and to infer the magnetic
ﬁeld topology (e.g., Labrosse et al., 2010, and references therein). These structures have also been routinely
observed in the last decade by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS, De Pontieu et al., 2014)
in the Mg II h and k resonance lines, which have been used to investigate dynamics in prominences (e.g.
Schmieder et al., 2014) and constrain nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) models (Heinzel
et al., 2015b; Vial et al., 2019; Levens and Labrosse, 2019; Peat et al., 2021). Similar studies have yet to be
conducted for AR ﬁlaments.

At the other end of the wavelength spectrum, low-resolution (>20(cid:48)(cid:48)) radio observations have shown that
quiescent ﬁlaments appear as depressions of the background brightness temperatures on disk at continuum
wavelengths between 3–8 mm, possibly due to free-free absorption by dense, cool material, and as emission
features at the limb (Kundu, 1972; Raoult et al., 1979; Schmahl et al., 1981; Vrsnak et al., 1992). At
wavelengths around 1 mm, prominences are still well visible at the limb (Harrison et al., 1993), but they
are practically invisible on disk (Bastian et al., 1993; Lindsey, 1994). Under certain conditions, brightness
measurements at different mm wavelengths can be used to constrain the optical thickness and kinetic
temperature of such structures (Heinzel et al., 2015a; Rodger and Labrosse, 2017; Gun´ar et al., 2018).

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA, Wootten and Thompson, 2009) provides an
opportunity to investigate ﬁlament substructure in the (thermal) millimeter continuum at a much higher
spatial resolution than before (see review by Wedemeyer et al., 2016). These capabilities have been recently
demonstrated for a prominence at the limb (Heinzel et al., 2022; Labrosse et al., 2022). The only ALMA
observations of ﬁlaments available until now have been taken with single dishes with a beam size of
approximately 25(cid:48)(cid:48) at 1.25 mm (White et al., 2017; Alissandrakis et al., 2017; Brajˇsa et al., 2018). Here, we
use interferometry maps with a signiﬁcantly improved spatial resolution (
0.6(cid:48)(cid:48) at 1.25 mm) that show
considerably lower brightness temperatures in an AR ﬁlament compared to the background. Because
of their smaller spatial scales, AR ﬁlaments had not yet been observed in this wavelength range. We
compare the ALMA maps to UV imagery provided by IRIS and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO,
Pesnell et al., 2012) and magnetograms obtained by the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT, Tsuneta et al., 2008)
onboard Hinode.

2 OBSERVATIONS

We observed NOAA AR 12738 on April 13, 2019, with ALMA Band 6 (240 GHz or 1.25 mm) in two
execution blocks between 14:15-15:10 UT and 16:52-17:47 UT in mosaic mode and with Band 3 (100 GHz
or 3 mm) in two execution blocks between 18:19-18:54 UT and 19:15-19:50 UT in single-pointing mode.

The target was a group of pores and plage region near the disk center at µ
heliocentric angle), west of a leading sunspot, where an AR ﬁlament was also visible for most of the
observing campaign. We obtained co-temporal observations with IRIS and Hinode for the ﬁrst Band 6 block
and part of the second block. There are no IRIS nor Hinode supporting observations to the ALMA Band 3
data. We also use full-disk images in the ultraviolet range taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA, Lemen et al., 2012) and continuum images at 6163 ˚A obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI, Scherrer et al., 2012) on SDO. We use one H α image taken by the Global Oscillation
Network Group (GONG, Harvey et al., 2011).

2.1 Data reduction and calibration

7m and 40

The ALMA array consisted of 9

12m functioning antennas, with a maximum baseline
length of about 700 m. In order to cover a signiﬁcant region of plage, a mosaic of ten different pointings was
carried out using Band 6, covering a region slightly larger than 1 arcminute across, which is comparable
to the Band 3 ﬁeld of view (FOV). The FOV of a 12 m antenna is 25(cid:48)(cid:48) at 230 GHz, and the centers of
adjacent mosaic ﬁelds have a separation of 12(cid:48)(cid:48). The observation cycled through the ten mosaic ﬁelds in
order, acquiring three 2 s integrations at each visit. The duration of a full mosaic cycle was 85 s; these were
repeated during scans on the Sun approximately 7-min long alternating with 2-min calibration scans.

×

We attempted to make time-resolved images of complete mosaic cycles using the standard Common
Astronomy Software Applications (CASA, McMullin et al., 2007) package, applying the recommended
”mosaic” gridding option, but we found that most of the resulting images were corrupted by bright or
dark features at the edges of the mosaic. This did not occur when the full-time range was mapped. To get
around this problem, we mapped and self-calibrated every integration in every ﬁeld separately without
primary beam correction, including the four base bands at 230, 232, 245 and 247 GHz to improve uv
coverage, and then combined them in a linear mosaic in the image plane, weighting overlapping regions of
the image using the appropriate primary beam response for the 12 m antennas. The single-ﬁeld images
were restored with a Gaussian beam with full-width-at-half-maximum of 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48). The three consecutive
integrations at each pointing were combined, and at each step, the time-dependent mosaic image was
created by replacing the previous image of the current ﬁeld with the new image, appropriately weighted
by the primary beam, and recalculating the mosaic. This resulted in a sequence of 280 mosaic images for
each of the two observations with a time separation of 9 s between mosaics within a scan, but the true time
resolution is more complicated due to the overlapping nature of the ﬁelds. Comparison of the resulting
images with cases where CASA successfully imaged a full 85 s mosaic cycle indicated good agreement.

The Band 6 mosaics were scaled to Tb units, and a value of 6 600 K was added to the mosaics to
compensate for the background level not observable by the interferometer, derived by inspection of the
corresponding FOV in single-dish images (taken with the total-power array) that measure the full solar disk
temperatures. The typical temperature range in individual mosaic images is from

8 500 K.

The Band 3 data consists of single-pointing maps at 2-s cadence, maximum spatial resolution of 1.2(cid:48)(cid:48),
and noise level of 20 K. We refer to da Silva Santos et al. (2020) for a detailed explanation of the data
reduction, which includes self-calibration, primary beam correction, and absolute ﬂux calibration.

The SDO level 1 data were converted into level 1.5 using the aia prep routine in SolarSoftWare (SSW,
Freeland and Handy, 1998). Further processing including coaligment, resampling, and derotation was
performed using the SunPy package (The SunPy Community et al., 2020). The HMI 6173 ˚A continuum
images were deconvolved using the Enhance deep learning code1 (D´ıaz Baso and Asensio Ramos, 2018).
The AIA 304 ˚A images were corrected for stray light using semi-empirical point-spread functions (Poduval
et al., 2013) and instrumental degradation. The data cadences are 12 s and 24 s in the EUV and UV.

The IRIS data comprises a time series of dense 64-step raster scans in the near-UV and far-UV wavelength
ranges. Here we only use the spectral data around the Mg II h and k lines that probe the chromosphere;
there is no signal in the far-UV lines in the ﬁlament. The pixel scale is 0.166(cid:48)(cid:48) along the slit and the size of

The co-aligment of the IRIS and Hinode data was improved by cross-correlation with the HMI continuum
images. The ALMA Band 6 maps were cross-correlated with AIA 304 ˚A images taken at an instant close to
the middle of each ALMA mosaic sampled at the same spatial resolution. This allowed a proper coalignment
of the EUV and mm brightenings recurring near the pore at the center of the FOV (not displayed; see also
da Silva Santos et al., 2020).

2.2 Data clustering

To investigate the spatial correlation between the Mg II h and k proﬁles and the mm continuum emission,
we applied an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method to the former using the hierarchy library in
Scipy (Virtanen et al., 2020) wherein proﬁles are grouped based on a distance metric. We used Ward’s
linkage method, which minimizes the within-cluster variance (Ward, 1963), that is the spread in the
euclidean distances between each cluster member and the centroid. This technique can be interpreted as a
type of dimensionality reduction in that the information in the IRIS spectra with hundreds of wavelength
points is condensed into a single number, which can then be compared to the 1.25 mm continuum brightness.
The number of clusters was decided upon visual inspection of the dendrogram. While that choice is arbitrary,
we concluded that 15 clusters were a good compromise between limiting the impact of noise and being able
to identify sufﬁcient spatial structure within the ﬁlament while tracking its time evolution. The clustering is
based on 20475 spectral proﬁles of the wavelength window between 2791.2–2809.6 ˚A, which includes the
Mg II h, k, and UV triplet lines.

Figure 1 shows the target as observed by the different instruments at the start of the coordinated
campaign. Observations of this AR with ALMA have shown that Tb(3 mm) correlates poorly with
AIA 1600 ˚A intensity (r = 0.34, da Silva Santos et al., 2020). Here, we ﬁnd that Tb(1.25 mm) correlates

shorter mm wavelengths. An overall better agreement is found with the AIA 304 ˚A intensities, especially
during small-scale transient brightenings similarly to the ones observed with Band 3 (da Silva Santos et al.,
2020), but we did not quantify this correlation as the main focus of this paper is the AR ﬁlament described
below.

The observations also reveal a dark ﬁlamentary structure that can be identiﬁed in all of the chromospheric
diagnostics in the upper part of the FOV. However, the ﬁlament appears fragmented into pieces at 1.25 mm
in contrast with the more uniform dark structures seen in H α, He I 304 ˚A, and Mg II k. Brightness values
as low as Tb(1.25 mm)

Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of the ﬁlament as seen by the different instruments. The y-axes
in all panels are aligned with solar north. The appearance of the ﬁlament in the Band 6 maps changes
dramatically over one hour as parts of it practically vanish and reappear, whereas the ﬁlament spine remains
well visible in the Mg II core images throughout. The dark Band 6 structures thin out around 14:36 UT
when a bright thread forms in the 304 ˚A images, following a brightening at the eastern footpoint of the
ﬁlament. The lowest Tb(1.25 mm) values (<5000 K) are located near the widest part of the ﬁlament but
usually offset from the darkest regions in the 304 ˚A images. We ﬁnd that the coolest Tb(1.25 mm) values
correlate with the darkest features in the k2v and k2r images, whereas the dark clouds in the core of the
h and k lines (as indicated by the arrows), which probes higher heights, are indistinguishable from the
background at 1.25 mm. Note that depending on the phase of the IRIS slit-scan, there could be a time lag
1.5 min between the latter and ALMA. Even in the darkest part of the ﬁlament, the intensities
of up to
in the core of the Mg II lines are about 10
15% brighter than the mean QS proﬁle at disk center, yet the
ﬁlament contrast is high owing to the bright surrounding plage. The SOT magnetograms do not show a
signiﬁcant change in the photospheric magnetic ﬂux underneath the ﬁlament spine over time.

central reversals are the shallowest, and the h and k double peaks are more symmetric, which suggests
small velocity gradients. The average k line width measured at half intensity between the averaged k2v and
0.54 ˚A in the nearby plage (e.g.,
k2r peaks and the averaged k1r and k1v dips is
proﬁle N). The ﬁlament body north of the Band 6 contours shows Mg II proﬁles that are just as dark in the
h and k cores as in the lower part (cf. Fig. 2), but they are broader and show stronger, more asymmetrical,
and separated k2v and k2r (or h2v, h2r) peaks, so they are classiﬁed as a different type. This implies that
the coolest Band 6 temperatures coincide with the regions of lower integrated intensity in the h and k lines
where the coolest and densest material may be located.

The aforementioned trend generally holds at different times but the time lag between the mm and NUV
diagnostics has to be taken into consideration. At 14:26, low Tb(1.25 mm) values coincide with locations
with A- and B-type IRIS proﬁles – they are essentially of the same kind but B-types are only slightly
broader and brighter. These proﬁles practically disappear at 14:35, so do Tb(1.25 mm) < 5000 K; this
appears to be related to the heating event that occurs along the ﬁlament spine as shown by the 304 ˚A image;
both signatures reappear at 15:05. We note that there are locations outside of the ﬁlament that show A- or
B-type proﬁles where low Tb(1.25 mm) values are not found, and vice-versa, which just indicates relative,
spatially-dependent opacity variations in both diagnostics.

Figure 4 shows selected ALMA Band 3 maps obtained after the Band 6 mosaics. The AIA images show a
more dramatic evolution of the ﬁlament compared to an earlier time in the day (cf. Fig. 2), to the point
that the ﬁlament practically vanished towards the end of the second observing block. Unlike the 1.25 mm
maps, the 3 mm maps do not show the same dark features against the background. This is interesting in that
the optical thickness is expected to increase with wavelength, so the absorbing features in Band 6 should
appear even darker in Band 3, that is the contrast is expected to slightly increase at longer wavelengths
by extrapolation of the contrast curve obtained from previous low-resolution observations of quiescent
ﬁlaments in the mm and cm ranges (Raoult et al., 1979). Therefore, it is somewhat surprising that the

This paper presents ALMA observations of an AR ﬁlament at two mm wavelengths supported by SDO and
partly by IRIS and Hinode. The ﬁlament shows substantial temporal variability in the AIA 304 ˚A passband,
the Mg II h and k lines, and in ALMA Band 6. Brightness variations are also detected in Band 3 but
they are more difﬁcult to discern from the background ﬂuctuations. As anticipated, the ALMA Band 6
interferometric Tb maps show dark/cool features with much higher contrast relative to the background
than the single-dish observations reported thus far (Alissandrakis et al., 2017; Brajˇsa et al., 2018). Very
ﬁne dark threads can be seen at certain times (e.g., Fig. 2, 14:36 UT), but they do not last more than a few
minutes. However, not all of the ﬁlament body (as seen by IRIS or AIA 304 ˚A) appears dark, but there are
signiﬁcant brightness variations across the ﬁlament spine. We note that the ﬁlament is also visible in the
second Band 6 observing block until 17:47 UT (not displayed). We did not identify signiﬁcant changes in
the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld that we could relate to the ﬁlament variability, but we would need ﬁeld
extrapolations to study the topology of the ﬁlament itself to investigate a possible correlation between
”magnetic dips” and the mm continuum brightness distribution, similarly to what has been done based on
H α observations (e.g., Aulanier et al., 1999; van Ballegooijen, 2004; Guo et al., 2010; Li et al., 2017).

We ﬁnd a spatial association between the integrated k line intensity and Tb(1.25 mm) in the ﬁlament that
is consistent in time. This suggests that both diagnostics are coupled through changes in temperature and
electron density. The Mg II lines are narrower and the central reversals are shallower than the average QS
proﬁle at those locations. The coolest Tb(1.25 mm) values coincide with the dark structures that are visible
away from the k (and h) line center and thus extend down to lower heights in the atmosphere. The lower
atmosphere may be ﬁlled with low-lying dense cool threads where the absorption is high but the emissivity
is low, hence the weak Mg II lines. However, interpreting the Mg II line shapes is not trivial as they depend
on the interplay between the incident radiation, gas pressure, ﬁlament thickness, and the properties of the
prominence-corona transition region (Heinzel et al., 2014), and thus require a follow-up investigation.

Detailed radiative transfer models of AR ﬁlaments are scarce in the literature. The spectral synthesis
based on a 3D whole-prominence ﬁne structure model presented by Gun´ar et al. (2016) shows ﬁlament
threads in emission by a few hundred kelvins above a uniform disk background at 1.25 mm unlike what we
observed; the simulated ﬁlament is optically thin (τν < 1) at this wavelength. The emerging brightness
temperature is the result of the absorbed background brightness temperature, T bcg
, plus the integrated
emission along a geometrical path of length L:

where κν is the frequency-dependent absorption coefﬁcient (e.g., Gun´ar et al., 2016). Brightness temperature
values lower than the background level require kinetic temperatures, T , lower than background temperatures.
However, the observed AR ﬁlament and background certainly have different properties than the simulated
ones. Dedicated simulations with more realistic AR conditions are needed to investigate this.

Constraining both the kinetic temperature and thickness of the prominence is not possible using single-
band data but it requires simultaneous observations at two wavelengths and the assumption of isothermal
conditions (e.g., Heinzel et al., 2015a; Rodger and Labrosse, 2017). In that case, Eq. 1 simpliﬁes to

Tb(ν) = T bcg

Thermal structure of AR ﬁlaments

∼

An hour after the Band 6 observations, the ﬁlament is still visible in the AIA 304 ˚A images, but it is
indiscernible from the background in Band 3. This cannot be attributed to a difference in spatial resolution
(by a factor of
2) because the dark threads in the Band 6 with the typical sizes of a few arcseconds
would be well resolved with Band 3. Instead, it could imply that the ﬁlament temperature is similar to the
background. We note that the background is far from uniform, which makes it complicated to interpret Tb
variations within the ﬁlament. Assuming that the average properties of the ﬁlament did not signiﬁcantly
change between the time the Band 6 and Band 3 maps were taken, which is a reasonable assumption at least
for the ﬁrst Band 3 observing block (Fig. 4), it is difﬁcult to reconcile these observations with an isothermal
model since we would expect even stronger absorption features at 3 mm than at 1.25 mm (see also Rodger
et al., 2019). Following Dulk (1985), the opacity ratio in both bands is given by

An optically thick plasma at 3 mm with a kinetic temperature of 7500 K (equal to the mean QS background
at 3 mm) would show a higher mean Tb(1.25 mm) than what we have observed. For example, τ3 mm = 1
implies τ1.25 mm = 0.15 and Tb(1.25 mm)
6100 K, which would make the ﬁlament stand out above
the background. Therefore, these two wavelengths are more likely sensitive to different layers of the
ﬁlament with different temperature and density conditions, or there is a temperature gradient spanning
their formation heights, with Band 6 probing closer to the lowest temperatures of the ﬁlament, and Band 3
sensing warmer ﬁlament plasma or possibly the outermost shell that separates it from the corona if the
optical thickness is large. Simultaneous observations of AR ﬁlaments in both ALMA bands are needed to
clarify these ﬁndings.

∼

Combined non-LTE radiative transfer modeling of the Mg II h and k lines and the radio continua will be
required to diagnose the properties of the observed ﬁlament. Using such an approach, ALMA observations
will allow us to constrain the plasma temperature, while the IRIS spectra can provide information about the
pressure/density and the LOS velocity gradients.
