Abstract Using the observations from Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) onboard Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we develop a computational algorithm to auto-
matically identify the bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) in the active regions, and then
study their statistical properties. The individual magnetic (positive or negative) pole of
the BMR is determined from the region with an absolute strength above 55 G and with an
area above 250 pixel2 (∼495 Mm2), while a BMR is identiﬁed as a pair of positive and
negative poles with a shortest area-weight distance between them. Based on this method,
2234 BMRs are identiﬁed from the MDI synoptic magnetograms between the Carrington
Rotation 1909 (1996 May 06) and 2104 (2010 December 10). 1005 of them are located
in the northern hemisphere, while the other 1229 are in the southern hemisphere. We ﬁnd
that the BMR paraments (e.g., latitudes, separations, fragments, and strength) are similar
to those of active regions (ARs). Moreover, based on the maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) method, the frequency distributions of these BMRs occurrence as functions of area
size and magnetic ﬂux exhibit a power-law behavior, i.e., dN/dx ∝ x−αx , with an index
of αA = 1.98 ± 0.06 and αF = 1.93 ± 0.05. We also ﬁnd that their orientation angles
(θ) follow the “Hale’s Polarity Laws” and deviate slightly to the solar equator direction.
Consistent with the previous ﬁndings, we obtain the orientation angles dependence on the
latitudes for the normal BMRs during the 23rd solar cycle. The north-south asymmetry of
these BMRs is also detected here.

1 INTRODUCTION

The magnetic ﬁelds are believed as the dominant reasons for the evolution of solar activity, while
the stronger and larger magnetic ﬁelds on the solar surface are mainly in the active regions (ARs).
Meanwhile, most of the energetic and geo-effective events take place at the ARs, such as solar ﬂares,
coronal mass ejections (CMEs), solar energetic particle events, and eruptive prominences. Therefore,
quantitative study the magnetic ﬁelds in the ARs is important to the basic solar physics. As earlier as
more than 350 years ago, ARs have been studied as sunspots on white light images (e.g., Wolf, 1861;
Maunder, 1904; McKinnon & Waldmeier, 1987; Hathaway et al., 1999; Li et al., 2001; Hathaway et al.,
2003; Zhang et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2011; Hathaway, 2010). It is well known that the number of the
sunspots on solar disk display a periodic behavior, which has an average period of about 11 years. And
the positions of the sunspots exhibit the butterﬂy shapes, which is well-known as “Butterﬂy Diagram”,
this suggests that the behavior of the sunspot follows the “Sp¨orer’s Law of Zones”. The sunspots are
those regions with stronger magnetic ﬁelds on the Sun, and their magnetic nature is followed by the fa-
mous “Hale’s Polarity Laws”. Both the unipolar spots and the preceding members of the bipolar spots,
their magnetic polarity is negative before the last sunspot minimum and positive since the solar mini-
mum in the northern hemisphere, while in the southern hemisphere, their magnetic polarity is positive

before the last sunspot minimum and negative since the solar minimum (Hale et al., 1919). That is to say,
the signs of the sunspot could be reversed at the solar minimum, thus the period of the solar magnetic
ﬁelds is about 22 years, which is called as solar magnetic cycle.

The characteristics of the magnetic ﬁelds at ARs have been reported by many authors (e.g., Howard,
1989; Wang & Sheeley, 1989; Harvey & Zwaan, 1993; Zhang et al., 2010). Using the Mount Wilson
daily magnetogram data set, Howard (1989) presented various properties of the magnetic ﬁelds at solar
ARs. For example, the average separation of the magnetic polarity was about 7 deg (∼86 Mm), the
distribution of the magnetic ﬂux per AR showed a peak of about 2 × 1021 Mx. This was similar to
the value of 4 × 1021 Mx obtained by Wang & Sheeley (1989), who used the data from National Solar
Observatory/Kitt Peak during 1976−1986. Latter, Harvey & Zwaan (1993) studied the properties of
the ARs from the NSO/KP full-disk magnetogram during1975−1986 throughout Solar Cycle 21, and
their conclusion was that the shape of the characteristic size distribution for the ARs was a fundamental
invariant property of solar magnetic activity. Recently, using the high-resolution synoptic magnetograms
constructed from SOHO/MDI image during 1996−2008, Zhang et al. (2010) identiﬁed 1730 ARs and
quantiﬁed their physical properties. The mean and maximum magnetic ﬂux of the individual ARs were
1.67×1022 Mx and 1.97×1023 Mx, while those of each Carrington rotation were 1.83×1023 Mx and
6.96×1023 Mx, respectively.

literatures

A number

(e.g., Bogdan et al.,

1988; Abramenko & Longcope,

2005;
Canﬁeld & Russell, 2007; Zhang et al., 2010) have reported the distribution of magnetic ﬂux or
area of ARs and sunspots. These papers reported that the distribution related to ARs are usually log-
normal. For example, Zhang et al. (2010) have analyzed the frequency distribution of ARs, and found
that the distribution with the function of area size and magnetic ﬂux following a log-normal function,
this was consistent with the results obtained by Abramenko & Longcope (2005) and Canﬁeld & Russell
(2007). And Bogdan et al. (1988) found the sunspot umbral area were distributed lognormally with
Mount Wilson white-light data in the interval between 1917 and 1982. However, Parnell et al. (2009)
analyzed the magnetograms from SOHO/MDI and Hinode/SOT, they found that all feature ﬂuxes
following the power law distribution with a slope of 1.85 ± 0.14. While Tang et al. (1984) studied
the 15 years of ARs data using the Mount Wilson daily magnetograms data from 1967 to 1981, and
their results revealed that the number of the ARs decreased exponentially with the increasing AR
sizes. This was also proved by Zharkov et al. (2005), who found that the number of sunspots growing
nearly exponentially with their area decreasing. Meanwhile, Harvey & Zwaan (1993) have successfully
used the polynomial function to ﬁt the NSO/KP data. These different ﬁt functions are caused by the
different observation data, and they may be related to the physical mechanism of the ARs emergences.
The log-normal distribution has been regarded as the result of magnetic fragmentation in the solar
envelope (Bogdan et al., 1988). While the log-normal distribution of the AR’s ﬂux may also suggest
that the process of fragmentation dominates over the process of concentration in the formation of the
magnetic structure in ARs (Abramenko & Longcope, 2005; Canﬁeld & Russell, 2007). On the other
hand, the power-law distribution of the AR’s ﬂux possibly suggests a self-similar nature of all ARs
(McAteer et al., 2005). If considering the magnetic ﬂux between 2×1017 Mx and 1023 Mx, then the
power-law distribution also suggests that the mechanisms of the surface magnetic features are scale-free
(Parnell et al., 2009). Finally, Schrijver et al. (1997) thought that the exponential distribution was lead
by the frequent fragmentation and collision (or merging) of the magnetic features.

The orientation angles of the magnetic ﬁelds at ARs are important to understand the solar physics,
they not only represent the important quantity that is related to the large-scale properties of magnetic
ﬁeld distribution, but may be also related to the dynamo progress which is believed to lead the solar
activity cycle (Babcock, 1961; Leighton, 1964, 1969; Sheeley et al., 1985). Howard (1989) have stud-
ied the orientation angles of the magnetic regions at ARs with Mount Wilson magnetograms. He found
that the distribution of ARs orientation angles showing two broad maxima centered on the ‘normal’ ori-
entation, and the reversed oriented ARs tending to be relatively evenly distributed in orientation angle
compared to the normally oriented ones. However, the most studies are the tilt angles of the magnetic re-
gions, which are similar to the orientation angles but not the same. The orientation angle is deﬁned as the
angle from the positive/negative towards negative/positive ﬁelds (Howard, 1989). While the tilt angle is

Statistical properties of the Bipolar Magnetic Regions

deﬁned to be the angle between the bipolar axis line and heliographic east-west line (Wang & Sheeley,
1989), it is the angle measured positive for magnetic regions with leading ﬁelds equatorward of follow-
ing ﬁelds and negative for magnetic regions with leading ﬁelds poleward of following ﬁelds (Howard,
1991a; Li & Ulrich, 2012). In other word, the tilt angle is very useful to study the Hale’s and Joy’s
laws (Li & Ulrich, 2012), while the orientation angle only exhibits the incline of the ARs on solar disk.
The ﬁrst detailed study the tilt angles of the magnetic regions is Hale et al. (1919), who found that the
average tilt angles of sunspots increasing with solar latitudes. This result was conﬁrmed by Brunner
(1930), who also found that the larger, well-developed sunspots tending to have small tilt angles than
the smaller, less-developed ones. Then Wang & Sheeley (1989) used the NSO magnetograms to ﬁnd
that the average tilt angles of all BMRs relating to the east-west line showed a progressive increasing
toward high latitude, and the value was close to 9◦. After that, Howard (1991a) studied the tilt angles of
the magnetic regions in ARs with Mount Wilson magnetograms, he found that the variation of tilt angles
with solar latitudes was not dependent on the solar cycle phases. These ARs with the larger absolute tilt
angles have the rapid separation of the magnetic poles on average, and their sizes are smaller than those
with smaller absolute tilt angles. Lately, Howard (1991b) studied the tilt angles of the sunspots with
Mount Wilson daily white-light photographs, he obtained the similar results to the earlier studies about
ARs (e.g., Wang & Sheeley, 1989; Howard, 1991a), and the average tilt angle of the sunspots was 4.2
± 0.2 degree in his study.

In this paper, we automatically identify the BMRs in the ARs with the high-resolution Carrington
rotation synoptic magnetogram charts constructed from SOHO/MDI observations between 1996 and
2010, and then study their orientation angles. This paper is organized as following: the observation and
data reduction are introduced in Section 2, and the observation results are given in Section 3, then our
conclusions and discussions are given in Section 4.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

2.1 Observations

The data used here are from the SOHO/MDI magnetograms (Scherrer et al., 1995). MDI is designed to
measure the velocity, intensity and magnetic ﬁelds in the photosphere, and further to study the magnetic
ﬁelds in the corona. It can be detected the full solar disk magnetogram with the spatial resolution of
∼2′′ pixel−1 in every 96 minutes (Domingo et al., 1995). However, the full disk MDI magnetograms
are not used directly in this paper, but the Carrington Rotation (CR) synoptic charts are used to analyze,
and they can be downloaded from the MDI homepages. The CR synoptic charts from MDI have two
forms: magnetic ﬁeld and intensity synoptic charts. Only the magnetic ﬁeld charts are used in this paper.
They are generated from the MDI magnetograms at level 1.8. They are well re-calibrated, and several
observations of every location which have been collected over the course of a solar rotation (∼27 days)
are averaged to make up the charts. Therefore, the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld at each synoptic grid
point is averaged, and they have been corrected by the differential rotation before. Through the averaging
process, the effects of cosmic rays have also been reduced. The projection effect of the magnetic ﬁled
have been corrected by assuming that MDI makes line-of-sight measurements of a radial magnetic ﬁeld.
Finally, the correction to the pixel area has also been performed in this paper with a scaling factor (see.,
Berger & Lites, 2003; Tran et al., 2005; Ulrich et al., 2009).

The ﬁnally synoptic charts of the magnetic ﬁelds have two versions of the maps: a radial and a line-
of-sight (LOS) version. The synoptic charts about the projection effect along the longitude are much
better than the snapshot magnetograms, but they have lost the temporal resolution. The noise level of
the synoptic charts is about 5 Gauss, and the resolution of the synoptic charts have been changed to
a 3600 × 1080 pixel synoptic map. The carrington longitude is linear, while the carrington latitude is
sine. Noting that the data at each longitude in these synoptic charts is observed at different time, so the
longitude in the synoptic charts is also represent the time information.

All the synoptic maps, whether the radial or the LOS are constructed from the data which observed
by the disk meridians. These maps used the data that observed near central meridian (0◦) are called

4

ordinarily synoptic charts, and additional charts are using the data from other disk meridians, such as
60◦E, 45◦E, 30◦E, 15◦E, 15◦W, 30◦W, 45◦W, and 60◦W. However, those additional charts have the
disadvantage of disk longitude offsetting, the ordinarily synoptic charts have not, so only the ordinarily
synoptic charts are used in this paper. Therefore, only the LOS magnetic ﬁeld observed near central
meridian for Carrington Rotation synoptic charts are used to identiﬁed the BMRs. Figure 1 (a) shows an
example of the synoptic images which we use in this paper.

netogram after subtracting the strength threshold from panel (a); (c): The magnetogram after
subtracting the area threshold from panel (b), the blue and yellow circles are the positive and
negative poles, while the ‘+’ and ‘×’ represent the geometric centers and the ﬂux-weighted
centers, respectively; the identiﬁed BMRs are connected with the red lines, the ﬁlled circles
are the positions of the BMRs. The green line in each panel represents the solar equator.

2.2 Data reduction

Two magnetic poles of the BMRs in the active regions are deﬁned by the threshold method, which
include the strength and area thresholds. As illustrated in Figure 1, there are essentially two steps, each
of which corresponds to one panel in this ﬁgure. The ﬁrst step is to deﬁne the magnetic poles of the

Statistical properties of the Bipolar Magnetic Regions

BMRs. The positive and negative magnetite ﬁelds are separated from the observation data, and the two
magnetic poles are identiﬁed respectively. Then we determine the strength threshold of the positive or
negative magnetic ﬁled for every magnetogram with equation (1). However, the magnetograms used in
this paper are from May 1996 to December 2010, which included the whole 23rd solar cycle and the
beginning phase of 24rd solar cycle. The strength thresholds with equation 1 for different phases of the
magnetograms have large difference. To rule out this difference, we take the average value (T H) of all
thresholds, and this value is 55 G for the positive ﬁled and -55 G for the negative ﬁeld. This value is
similar to that used by Zhang et al. (2010), who have been identiﬁed the ARs by the minimum magnetic
ﬁled of 50 G with SOHO/MDI synoptic magnetograms. Figure 1 (b) gives the results after subtracting
the T H from the original observation data.

T H = µ ± γ · σ,

(1)

In equation (1), µ is the mean value, and σ represents the standard deviation, while γ is a constant
which determines empirically based on the type features to be detected. In this paper we set γ = 2,
which is same as Colak & Qahwaji (2008) to determine the magnetic polarities of ARs. While ‘+’ is for
the positive ﬁled and ‘-’ is for the negative ﬁled.

Next, we will identify the two poles of the BMRs by the area threshold. The magnetic images
have been separated several individual unconnected regions after subtracting the strength threshold,
and these regions can be marked automatically by the code of LABEL REGION.pro in Interactive
Data Language (IDL). However, these isolated regions are not considered as the magnetic poles, for
these isolated regions which close to each other may be the same magnetic pole. Therefore, we have to
determine the area of the magnetic poles. That is to say, it is possible that these closer regions belong to
the same magnetic pole. So the positions (geometric centers) and the equivalent diameters (consider the
isolated region as a circle) of these isolated regions have been calculated; and for every isolated region,
we regard the geometric center as the reference point and two times equivalent diameters as edge length
to draw a square box. If these square box have the overlapping regions, they belong to one magnetic
pole, otherwise they belong to the different magnetic poles. Thus these closer isolated regions may be
one magnetic pole. But not all of the magnetic poles could be the real poles of the BMRs in this paper.
These poles which have small area are possible not to be the real poles of the BMRs in the active regions,
because we mainly study the larger and stronger BMRs here. Therefore, the small magnetic poles have to
be ruled out. The minimum area used here is similar to previous studies. For example, Harvey & Zwaan
(1993) studied the area of BMRs larger than 2.5 square degrees (∼373 Mm2); Tang et al. (1984) had
detected the ARs as small as 450 Mm2; the smallest area studied by Schrijver (1988) was 310 Mm2;
Wang & Sheeley (1989) even studied the ARs as small as about 200 Mm2. Based on these values, we
deﬁne the area (A) threshold as 250 pixel2 (∼495 Mm2) in this paper. In other words, these regions
with the total area less than 250 pixel2 are excluded as the magnetic poles. Figure 1 (c) shows the
positive (blue circles) and negative (yellow circles) poles in Carrington Rotation 1960, the plus (‘+’) and
cross (‘×’) represent the geometric center and the ﬂux-weighted center, respectively. And we consider
the ﬂux-weighted centers as the positions of the magnetic poles. For each magnetic pole (positive or
negative), we also calculate their radius (R), fragment number (N), magnetic ﬁeld (B), magnetic ﬂux
(F), and magnetic ﬂux density (f). Here, the magnetic pole is supposed to be a circle. The fragment
number is the amounts of the isolated regions in the magnetic pole, and the magnetic ﬁeld is maximum
value of the magnetic pole. The magnetic ﬂux is the total value of the magnetic pole, while the magnetic
ﬂux density is the mean value of the magnetic ﬁled.

The second step is to identify the BMRs from the identiﬁed positive and negative poles. In this
paper, we assume that BMRs are formed by the closest magnetic poles with opposite polarity, but the
BMR direction in northern is opposite from that in southern hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere, a
BMR is deﬁned as a negative pole to link the closest positive pole; while in the southern hemisphere, the
positive pole is used to link the closest negative one, such as the red lines linking the two magnetic poles
in Figure 1 (c). The distance (D) between the positive and negative poles of each BMR is measured,
and the ratio of D/R is shown in Figure 2. There is a normal distribution of D/R, and the maximum

6

Dong Li

Fig. 2 The ratio between the distance (D) and the radius (R) of the magnetic poles in northern
(solid line) and southern (dash line) hemispheres, respectively.

value is around 3. These BMRs with a big value of D/R, such as greater than 10, indicating a large
distance between positive and negative poles with a small area size, are possible not real. Therefore,
these BMRs with D/R ≥ 10 (the vertical line in Figure 2) are ruled out to analyze in this paper, i.e.,
the one marked with the rectangle. Namely, a positive pole linking with the negative one with a shortest
area-weight distance is identiﬁed as a BMR in the southern hemisphere. And the same rule is applied
in the northern hemisphere. The red lines in Figure 1 (c) link the identiﬁed BMRs, the ﬁlled circles
represent the positions of the BMRs, which are the middle positions of the positive and negative poles
of the BMRs.

3 RESULTS

Using the method mentioned in Section 2.2, we analyze the SOHO/MDI data from Carrington rotation
1909 (May 1996) to 2104 (December 2010). This period covers the whole 23rd solar cycle and the
beginning phase of 24rd solar cycle. There are 4 MDI images (CR1938,CR1939,CR1940 and CR1941)
missing due to the malfunction of the SOHO in 1998. Some MDI images (e.g., CR1937, CR1944,
CR1945, CR1956,CR2011, CR2015 and so on) are partial, but they are enough for our analysis. Finally,
2948 positive poles and 2940 negative poles are identiﬁed from these MDI images, and 2234 BMRs are
identiﬁed, 1005 of them are located in northern hemisphere, while the other 1229 are located in southern
hemisphere. However, there are 3171 NOAA ARs published during the same period. Such difference
is mainly because that only these LOS magnetic ﬁelds observed near central meridian are used. The
criterion to identify the BMRs and NOAA ARs is also different.

3.1 The positions of BMRs

In our study, each BMR has its own latitude and time. On the MDI synoptic image, the midpoint of the
positive and negative poles is marked as the BMR position, which is the function of the latitude and
time. Figure 3 (a) shows the distribution of the BMR latitudes. Most (95.7%, 2138/2234) of the BMRs
are located in the low latitude in the solar disk, i.e., between -30◦ and 30◦; while only 4.3% (96/2234)
BMRs are exceed this range but not higher than ±50◦. Here, ‘+’ and ‘-’ represent the latitudes of the
BMRs which located in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. This is consistent well

Statistical properties of the Bipolar Magnetic Regions

with the ARs and sunspots, which are also typically located at the low latitude in the solar surface. The
mean values of the BMR latitudes are 16◦ and -16◦ in northern and southern hemispheres, respectively.
Panel (b) further gives the BMR latitudes in solar disk varying with solar cycles, it appears similar as
the butterﬂy diagram described by Maunder (1904, 1922), which explained as the emergence positions
of the ARs (or sunspots) progressively drifting toward the solar equator (Hathaway et al., 2003). And
this further conﬁrms that the BMRs in this paper are essentially bipolar ﬁelds.

hemispheres, respectively. (b): The distribution of BMR latitudes with solar cycles, and the
two red lines show the ﬂux-weighted centers of BMRs per Carrington rotation for the two
solar hemispheres.

3.2 The parameters of the BMRs

For these identiﬁed BMRs, we statistical study their separations (DS), fragment number (N), area (A),
magnetic ﬁled (B), magnetic ﬂux (F), magnetic ﬂux density (f). The separations are the distance between
the positive and negative poles of the BMRs, and the fragment number, area and magnetic ﬂux are

the sum of absolute values for positive and negative poles of the BMRs, while the magnetic ﬁeld and
magnetic ﬂux density are the half of the total absolute values for positive and negative poles of the
BMRs. The statistical results are shown in Figure 4 and 5. While table 1 and 2 also list these parameters
in the documents to compare with the previous ﬁndings. Here AR1 and AR2 are the active regions
which identiﬁed from the different deﬁnitions, i.e., AR1 is the active region identiﬁed by Zhang et al.
(2010) based on their automated method, while AR2 is the active region deﬁned from the NOAA manual
catalog.

Figure 4 shows the distribution of each BMR parameter, and their typical values are listed in table 1.
The separated distances (DS) range from 3.2 Mm to 448 Mm, which is shown in panel (a). The largest
separation in this paper is greater than the value of 26 deg (∼320 Mm), which obtained by Howard
(1989). But the number of such large separation is very rare, for example, only 1 separation of the
BMR exceeds 400 Mm, while only 0.9% (20/2234) separation of the BMRs exceed 300 Mm. The mean
separation distance of these BMRs is 112 Mm, which is similar to the value of 86 Mm (Howard, 1989).
The fragment number (N) of these BMRs are from 2 to 168, and the average number of them are about
26, which is shown in panel (b). From panel (a) and (b), we can see that the distribution is similar to
that of the separation distances, the larger number is very less, only 1.9% (42/2234) are greater than
100. The same results are applied to the distribution of the BMR ﬂux density, as shown in panel (d).
The minimum ﬂux density is 58 Mx cm−2, the maximum ﬂux density is 339 Mx cm−2 and the average
ﬂux density is 117 Mx cm−2, while only 0.45% (10/2234) of them exceed 250 Mx cm−2. However,
the distribution of the BMR magnetic ﬁled is different. As shown in panel (c), there are two peaks in
the distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld, one is about 600 G, the other is around 1500 G, and the magnetic
strength ranges from 252 G to 2972 G.

For these 2234 BMRs, their area and magnetic ﬂux are also measured. The area of these BMRs
ranges from 1.0×1019 cm2 (∼1000 Mm2) to 7.97×1020 cm2 (∼7.97×104 Mm2). The smallest area
of BMRs in this paper is larger than previous results of 300−400 Mm2 for the ARs (Tang et al.,
1984; Schrijver, 1988; Harvey & Zwaan, 1993; Zhang et al., 2010), and the largest area is also greater
than the earlier results of about (1−7)×104 Mm2 for the ARs (Tang et al., 1984; Schrijver, 1988;
Wang & Sheeley, 1989; Harvey & Zwaan, 1993; Zhang et al., 2010). The ﬂux of these BMRs are from
1.7×1021 Mx to 2.43×1023 Mx, which is similar to the AR ﬂux from 8.6×1020 Mx to 1.97×1023 Mx
obtained by Zhang et al. (2010), but the maximum value is larger than earlier results of about 1022 Mx
for ARs (Howard, 1989; Wang & Sheeley, 1989). Then the frequency distributions of these BMRs oc-
currence as functions of ﬂux and area are shown in the two bottom panels of Figure 4. It is hard to say
that the behaviors of the frequency distributions for the whole area and ﬂux. However, using the maxi-
mum likelihood estimation (MLE) method developed by Clauset et al. (2009), both the BMR area and
ﬂux exhibit a power-law behavior, i.e., dN/dx ∝ x−αx . The MLE method is based on the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov statistic to determine the lower cutoff (xmin) of the power-law behavior, which is marked by the
dashed lines in panel (e) and (f). Using the MLE method, we obtain the power-law index of αF = 1.93 ±
0.05 for the BMR ﬂux and αA = 1.98 ± 0.06 for the BMR area. This is consistent well with the power-
law distribution of the large solar activities, such as radio bursts, soft X-rays, hard X-rays, interplanetary

type III bursts, interplanetary particle events and CMEs (Crosby et al., 1993; Aschwanden et al., 1998).
Dennis (1985) and Crosby et al. (1998) further summarize αx for the distributions of different ﬂare-
related parameters and state that it varies from 1.4 to 2.4. This is also proved by many authors for
solar ﬂares (Wheatland, 2000; Su et al., 2006; Li et al., 2012), CMEs (Wheatland, 2003), radio bursts
(Ning et al., 2007; Song et al., 2012) and other small-scale magnetic ﬁelds (Parnell et al., 2009; Li et al.,
2013). In our results, αA = 1.98 ± 0.06 for the area of the BMRs are followed by the fractal models
(Aschwanden & Parnell, 2002). While αF = 1.93 ± 0.05 for the BMR ﬂux are consistent with the index
of coronal activities (i.e., solar ﬂares, CME, radio burst) and bright points (Li et al., 2013). Our ﬁndings
indicate that there are not fundamental differences for their generation in solar atmosphere, whatever the
(small or large) scale or the (low or high) height above solar surface. And the observations also show
that both the coronal activities and bright points are strongly related to the magnetic ﬁelds, indicating
the common features of the generating magnetic structures at small or large scales.

Figure 5 displays the variation of BMR parameters per carrington rotation with the period from 1996
to 2010. The typical values of these BMR parameters per Carrington rotation are listed in table 2. Here
N0 is the number of the BMRs or ARs per carrington rotation, the other symbols is same as in table 1.
As shown in Figure 5, there are double peaks during solar maximum. And if we examine carefully
the panels (c), (d) and (e), we could ﬁnd that the second peak ﬂux (in late 2001) of BMRs are mainly
caused by the large area of the emerged BMRs, but not the mean strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. Based
on this, the 23rd solar cycle is peaked in late 2001 but not in early 2000. These results are consistent
well with previous ﬁndings (Zhang et al., 2010). From table 2 we can see that the BMR parameters are
consistent well with the AR parameters except for the fragment number. In Figure 5, we also plot the
BMR parameters vary with solar cycles in the northern (blue dashed line) and southern (red dashed
line) hemispheres, which clearly show the north-south asymmetry of the BMR distribution. And this
north-south asymmetry is also shown in panels (a) − (d) of Figure 4. Similar north-south asymmetry
of ARs has been reported earlier (Temmer et al., 2002; Zharkov & Zharkova, 2006; Zhang et al., 2010).
However, this asymmetry is not well understood yet. We also plot the parameters of positive (blue solid
line) and negative (red solid line) poles vary with solar cycles, and the positive and negative parameters
of the BMRs are almost the same during the solar cycles, although there may be some difference in one
or two carrington rotation periods. In table 2, the parameters of the BMRs and ARs are zero in solar
minimum, whether in our data or in other data. This is because that the chance of appearing ARs is very
small or even not in one carrington rotation during solar minimum.

3.3 The orientation of BMRs

The orientation angles of the ARs are important to understand the solar cycles and have been studied in
the past (e.g., Wang & Sheeley, 1989; Howard, 1989, 1991a). However, most of the data they used are
fully-disk magnetograms which observed on ground. In this paper, we use the MDI carrington rotation
charts to study the orientation angles. Figure 6 gives the deﬁnition of the orientation angle (θ) of BMRs
in northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. In northern hemisphere, the orientation angle (θ) is
deﬁned to be the angle of vector originating in the ﬂux-weighted center of the positive pole and rotating
clockwise and terminating in the ﬂux-weighted center of the negative pole; while it is deﬁned to be the
angle of vector originating in the ﬂux-weighted center of the negative pole and rotating anti-clockwise
and terminating in the ﬂux-weighted center of the positive pole in southern hemisphere. Noting that
we separately deﬁne the BMR orientation angle in northern and southern hemisphere. Both the BMR
orientation angles in northern and southern hemispheres range from -90◦ to 270◦. In this paper, the
normally oriented BMRs refer to those BMRs whose orientation angles range from -90◦ to 90◦, while
the abnormal orientation angles are between 90◦ and 270◦ in solar disk, whatever in northern hemisphere
or in southern hemisphere.

Figure 7 gives the orientation angle (θ) distribution of these BMRs with a bin of 10◦ in northern
(solid lines) and southern (dashed lines) hemispheres, respectively. Panel (a) shows all the BRMs are

from carrington rotation 1909 to 2104, including the whole 23rd solar cycle and the beginning phase of
24rd solar cycle. Since the orientation angles are ranging from -90◦ to 270◦ and most of them are focus
on around 0◦ or 180◦. In this paper, the median values of the whole data are 13◦ and 11◦ in northern
and southern hemispheres, respectively, indicating that whether in northern hemisphere or southern
hemisphere, the orientation angles of the BMRs are slightly deviated to the solar equator direction. In
panel (a), we can see that there are two peaks in both northern and southern hemispheres. And there
are much more BMRs around 0◦ than that around 180◦. Then we separated the BMRs into the entire
23rd solar cycle (from CRs 1909 to 2070) and the beginning phase of 24rd solar cycle (from CRs 2071
to 2104), as shown in panels (b) and (c). From which, there is only one peak whether in northern or

sphere the positive pole (‘+’) is the angle center, and the negative pole (‘-’) rotation clockwise;

southern hemispheres at the entire 23rd solar cycle, and the median values of the BMR orientation angles
are 11◦ and 10◦ in northern and southern hemispheres, which is similar to that of all the data. And at the
beginning of 24rd solar cycle, there is also one peak both in northern and southern hemispheres, but the
median values of the BMR orientation angles are 187◦ and 181◦ in northern and southern hemispheres,
respectively. These results suggest that the two peaks of the orientation angles in panel (a) are from the
23rd and 24rd solar cycles, respectively.

Our results show that the orientation angles of the BMRs are generally slightly deviated to the
solar equator direction (panel (a) in Figure 7), and that the directions of the BMRs are opposite in
northern and southern hemispheres (panel (a) in Figure 7), and that the magnetic polarity of BMRs
is reversed in solar minimum of the solar cycle (panel (b) and (c) in Figure 7). These results are also
shown in Figure 8, which gives the variation of BMR orientation angles with respect to the phase of
solar cycles from May 1996 to December 2010. The squares and triangles represent the BMRs located
in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. In this ﬁgure, the BMR orientation angles vary
with solar cycles, and the polarities of BMRs are changing in different solar cycles. We note that the
orientation angles are reversed around in June 2008. That is to say, the 23rd solar cycle is from 1996 to
2008, and the duration is about 12 years. This perhaps can be explained by the extended activity cycle,
because the sunspot region of a new solar cycle could begin to appear as much as ∼1.6 years before the
deﬁned solar minimum and continue to emerge up to ∼1.8 years after the following minimum. These
results are consistent well with the previous ﬁndings about the ARs (Howard, 1989; Wang & Sheeley,

that all the large-scale phenomenons related to the bipolar magnetic ﬁelds are following by the “Hale’s
Polarity Laws”. That is to say, during the ﬁrst solar cycle the positive poles of the BMRs are the leading
polarity in northern hemisphere and the negative poles of the BMRs are the leading polarity in southern
hemisphere; while in the next solar cycle, the BMR polarity is reversed, the leading polarity are negative
poles in northern hemisphere and positive poles in southern hemisphere.

Fig. 8 The time evolution of the BMR orientation angles (θ) from May 1996 to December
2010 in northern (squares) and southern (triangles) hemispheres.

Figure 9 displays the BMR orientation angles dependence on their latitudes (a), magnetic ﬁled (b),
separations (c), area (d), fragment number (e), total ﬂux (f) (the sum values between the absolute positive
and negative ﬂux), ﬂux density (g) and net ﬂux (h) (the minus values between the absolute positive and
negative ﬂux). It is hard to see any relationship between the orientation angles and other parameters
in the BMRs, especially between the orientation angles and their latitudes. Here all of the 2234 BMRs
are analyzed, including the normal and abnormal BMRs from May 1996 to December 2010. Then
only the BMRs (2127) during the 23rd solar cycle are selected to analyze, regardless of the northern
or southern hemispheres in solar disk. Figure 10 gives the average paraments for various values of
orientation angles of these 2127 BMRs. The BMRs with larger absolute orientation angles tend to show
greater deviation on average values of paraments (e.g. separations (a), area (b) and ﬂux (c)) than those
with smaller absolute orientation angles. Especially for these normal orientated BMRs whose orientation
angles between -50◦ and 50◦ (dotted lines), their deviation and ﬂuctuation are much smaller than other
BMRs. However, the net ﬂux of these normal orientated BMRs whose orientation angles between -50◦
and 50◦ (dotted lines) are always smooth and the ﬂuctuation are very small (panel d). But for those other
orientated BMRs (the absolute orientation angles are exceeded 50◦), their ﬂuctuation and deviation are
much larger. These results are similar to that obtained from the ARs by Howard (1989, 1991a), who
found that these ARs with less absolute orientation angles tend to show smaller deviation. Finally the
magnetic ﬂux of the BMRs in this paper are larger about one magnitude than others, which possibly
due to the resolution and sensitivity of the different instruments. Howard (1989) have been said that the
inherent disadvantage of their data is the poor resolution, and this is the advantage of our data as the
MDI magnetic charts have high resolution and high sensitivity.

Based on the above analyzing, only the normal BMRs 1543 which the orientation angles range
from -50◦ to 50◦ in 23rd solar cycle are selected to analyze, regardless of the northern or southern
hemisphere on solar disk. Figure 11 shows the orientation angles dependence on the absolute latitudes
for these 1543 normally oriented BMRs during the 23rd solar cycle, the average orientation angles are
taken over 2.5 degree latitudes, and the error bars represent the standard deviations of these mean values.
For these normally oriented BMRs, the orientation angles increase with their latitudes on the whole. This
is consistent well with the results that the tilt angles of the ARs and sunspots general increasing with the
latitudes (e.g., Hale et al., 1919; Wang & Sheeley, 1989; Howard, 1989, 1991a,b). And at the latitudes

equator-ward of about 5 degree, the orientation angles show the negative values on average but not very
signiﬁcant, which is also similar to the results from the tilt angles of ARs (Howard, 1991a).

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

Using SOHO/MDI LOS magnetic data from CRs 1909 to 2104, we statistically study the observa-
tional features of BMRs. To obtain the BMRs, we ﬁrstly identify the positive and negative poles with
the strength and area thresholds, respectively; then using the criteria of closest area-weight distance
between positive and negative poles to determine the BMRs. Finally, 2234 BMRs are obtained from
the observation data, 1005 of them are lactated in northern hemisphere and the other 1229 BMRs are
lactated in southern hemisphere.

For these BMRs, the average latitudes are 16◦ and -16◦ in northern and southern hemispheres,
respectively. And most (95.7%) of these BMRs locate between -30◦ and 30◦, while only a little (4.3%)
BMRs locate in high latitude but not exceed 50◦. The time variation of these BMR latitudes with solar
cycles is similar to the classical butterﬂy diagram of sunspots (Maunder, 1904, 1922). These BMRs are

also follow the “Sp¨orer’s Law”. The BMR separations, area, ﬂux are calculated (see table 1 and Figure 4)
and are similar to the results obtained by Zhang et al. (2010). However, the fragment number is much
larger than others, this is because that we do not limit the area size of the fragments. The variation of
BMR parameters per carrington rotation with solar cycles is also studied in this paper, and we further
conﬁrm that the 23rd solar cycle peaked in late 2001 but not in early 2000, this is consistent well with
the results obtained by Zhang et al. (2010). We also ﬁnd the north-south asymmetry of the BMRs, which
is similar to previous ﬁndings about the north-south asymmetry of the ARs (e.g., Temmer et al., 2002;
Zharkov & Zharkova, 2006; Zhang et al., 2010; Shetye et al., 2015).

We ﬁnd that the frequency distributions of these 2234 BMRs as function of magnetic ﬂux and area
exhibit a power-law behavior, and the power-law indexes, αF = 1.93 ± 0.05 for the magnetic ﬂux, αA
= 1.98 ± 0.06 for the area, which are consistent with the previous ﬁndings for the large-scale coronal

activities (e.g., solar ﬂares, CMEs, radio bursts) and small-scale magnetic elements (Li et al., 2013).
This suggests that the area size of the BMRs are followed by the fractal models (Aschwanden & Parnell,
2002) and the mechanisms of the surface magnetic features on the Sun are free of scales, indicating that
all the surface magnetic features, regardless of their scales, are generated by the similar mechanisms, or
indicating that the surface processes (i.e., fragmentation, coalescence, cancelation and so on) in a way
which lead to a distribution of scale-free. This is also proved by Parnell et al. (2009).

Using the deﬁnition introduced in Figure 6, we study the orientation angles (θ) of the BMRs. We
ﬁnd that most of the BMRs display a slightly deviated to the solar equator direction on the solar disk,
whatever in the northern or southern hemispheres, their median value are 13◦ and 11◦, respectively.
The orientation angles of these BMRs are followed by “Hale’s Polarity Laws”, and the polarity of the
BMRs is reversed in different solar cycles. We do not ﬁnd any clearly one by one correlation between
the orientation angles and other paraments for all the BMRs. However, if only considering the average
values of the orientation angles between -50◦ and 50◦ for the normally oriented BMRs during the 23rd
solar cycle, the dependence of the orientation angles with latitudes is found as before, which is that
the orientation angles increase with the latitudes (see. Figure 11). But for all the BMRs, these with
less absolute orientation angles tend to show smaller deviation (e.g., Hale et al., 1919; Wang & Sheeley,
1989; Howard, 1989, 1991a,b).

In this paper, the BMRs in active regions are deﬁned by the closest magnetic poles with opposite
polarities, which could result into some wrongly or missing BMRs. Therefore, the errors estimation will
be given through comparing the NOAA ARs and our BMRs. Here, the NOAA catalog is assumed to
provide the ‘ground truth’. Fig. 12 gives the MDI synoptic charts for CR 1960. In this rotation, 24 BMRs
are identiﬁed by our method, which are marked with the red pluses (‘+’). At the same time intervals and
meridian regions, 30 NOAA ARs are published, as indicted by the turquoise crosses (‘×’). For these
identiﬁed BMRs, 70% (21/30) of them could be found a one-to-one correspondence with the NOAA
ARs, as shown with the overlapping symbols. For these BMRs without the corresponding NOAA ARs,
only one (‘I’) maybe not the real BMR because it has the same positive pole with other BMR. The other
two (‘II’ and ‘III’) could be the real BMRs as they have the larger and stronger magnetic ﬁeld with
opposite polarities. Therefore, the true identiﬁed BMRs from the NOAA ARs could be more than 70%.
On the other hand, there are 9 NOAA ARs have missed from our method. Most of these missing NOAA

(‘+’) mark the positions of the identiﬁed BMRs, and the turquoise crosses (‘×’) indicate the
sites of the the NOAA ARs.

ARs are possibly not the real BMRs according to our method. Because some of these missing NOAA
ARs only display one stronger poles, such as ARs ‘5’, ‘6’ and ‘9’. Some others have two opposite but
very disperse magnetic poles, i.e., ARs ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘7’, and ‘8’. In a word, our method is useful for these
BMRs connecting to the opposite magnetic poles with stronger and compact magnetic ﬁelds.

Basing on the computational algorithm, we have automatically identiﬁed 2234 BMRs in the active
regions from MDI synoptic magnetograms during 1996 to 2010. Meantime, there are total 3171 NOAA
ARs published during the same intervals. We could pick up ∼70.5% (2234/3171) of the total NOAA
ARs. Considering that only these LOS magnetic ﬁelds observed near central meridian are used in this
paper, some NOAA ARs maybe not appear at the central meridian regions. That is to say, not all the
3171 NOAA ARs could be detected by our observations. Therefore, we can ﬁnd more than ∼70.5%
of the appearing NOAA ARs. On the other hand, Fig. 7 (b) shows that the peak distribution of 180
degree is still existent but less obvious than that in panel (a). This peak possible duo to the wrongly
identifying BMRs from our computational algorithm. Fig. 8 suggests that these abnormal orientations
appear mainly in solar maximum. Based on these facts, we could pick up the wrongly identifying BMRs
in solar maximum. At last, 52 (or 77) BMRs are wrongly identiﬁed in northern (or southern) hemisphere.
And then the accuracy rate is about 94.3%.
