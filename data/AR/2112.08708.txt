ABSTRACT
AR Sco is a binary system that contains a white and red dwarf. The rotation rate of the white dwarf has been observed to
slow down, analogous to rotation-powered radio pulsars; it has thus been dubbed a “white dwarf pulsar”. We previously ﬁt the
traditional radio pulsar rotating vector model to the linearly polarised optical data from this source, constraining the system
geometry as well as the white dwarf mass. Using a much more extensive dataset, we now explore the application of the same
model to binary phase-resolved optical polarimetric data, thought to be the result of non-thermal synchrotron radiation, and
derive the magnetic inclination angle 𝛼 and the observer angle 𝜁 at diﬀerent orbital phases. We obtain a ∼ 10◦ variation in 𝛼 and
∼ 30◦ variation in 𝜁 over the orbital period. The variation patterns in these two parameters is robust, regardless of the binning
and epoch of data used. We speculate that the observer is detecting radiation from an asymmetric emission region that is a stable
structure over several orbital periods. The success of this simple model lastly implies that the pitch angles of the particles are
small and the pulsed, non-thermal emission originates relatively close to the white dwarf surface.

1 INTRODUCTION

AR Scorpii (AR Sco) was recently reclassiﬁed as a novel binary
system containing a white dwarf (WD) and an M-dwarf companion
(Marsh et al. 2016), based on the detection of pulsed non-thermal
emission extending from radio to X-rays (Buckley et al. 2017; Takata
et al. 2018). The majority of proposed models (Section 3) propose that
this emission is due to synchrotron radiation (SR). Analysis of Fermi
LAT data by Kaplan et al. (2019) indicated a possible detection at
3.8𝜎 signiﬁcance, which may point to the existence of an additional
spectral component. More recently, however, and using more than 10
years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, Singh et al. (2020)
derived a 2𝜎 upper limit of 2.27×10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 on the integral
energy ﬂux above 100 MeV from the binary system AR Sco.

A binary orbital period of 𝑃b = 3.56 hours, a WD spin period of
𝑃 = 1.95 minutes, and a beat period of 1.97 minutes were inferred
(Marsh et al. 2016). Interestingly, the orbital separation 𝑎 is smaller
than the WD light cylinder radius1 𝑅LC, implying that the companion
is located inside the WD magnetosphere at 𝑎 ≈ 0.13𝑅LC. The novelty
of the system is due to an established WD spin-down rate ﬁrst inferred
by Marsh et al. (2016) and more ﬁrmly established by Stiller et al.

(2018) using extensive observations as (cid:164)𝑃 = 7.18 × 10−13 s s−1. The
implied spin-down power (cid:164)𝐸rot = 𝐼WDΩ (cid:164)Ω ≈ 5 × 1033 erg s−1, with
Ω the angular velocity and (cid:164)Ω its time derivative, for a ﬁducial WD
moment of inertia 𝐼WD = 3 × 1050 g cm2, indicates that the observed
non-thermal emission can indeed be powered by the rotational spin-
down of the WD.

The uniqueness of this system was conﬁrmed by the observed lack
of Doppler-broadened emission lines from accreting gas, suggesting
the absence of an accretion disk2. This is supported by the fact that
the X-ray luminosity is only 4% of the total optically-dominated
luminosity and is only ∼ 1% of the X-ray luminosities of typical
intermediate polars (IP), and also from the fact that all optical and
ultraviolet emission lines originate from the irradiated face of the M-
dwarf companion. This means that AR Sco has diﬀerent properties
from standard IPs and is not in a propeller state as the well-known
AR Aquarii.

The dual characteristics of observed WD spin-down and absence
of an accretion disk led Buckley et al. (2017) to attribute the observed

2 Conversely, Takata et al. (2018) possibly detected an iron ionisation emis-
sion line using XMM Newton. This was conﬁrmed by NuStar observations
(Koglin et al. 2005). Such a line could be indicative of the presence of an
accretion disk, but this does not ﬁt the observed broadband spectrum. Also,
one could speculate that the iron line is due to ionised material in the system.

non-thermal luminosity to magnetic dipole radiation3 from the WD,
establishing AR Sco as the ﬁrst known4 WD pulsar, analogous to
rotation-powered neutron star pulsars. Recently, a claim was made
for a second such system, based on 0.8 magnitude coherent variations
in the optical, with a periodicity of 12.37 minutes (Kato & Kojiguchi
2021).

The WD in AR Sco is believed to be highly magnetized, with
a polar surface ﬁeld of 𝐵p ∼ 8 × 108 G (inferred by equating the
spin-down loss rate to the magnetic dipole loss rate) and its optical
emission is strongly linearly polarized (up to∼ 40%; Buckley et al.
2017). In the radio, the degree of linear polarization is much lower,
< 1%, possibly due to this emission coming from non-relativistic
plasma (Stanway et al. 2018). Extensive optical observations indi-
cated that the linear ﬂux, circular ﬂux, and polarization position angle
(PPA) are coupled to the spin period 𝑃 of the WD and not the beat
period (Potter & Buckley 2018a). The spin phase-folded PPA data
from these observations clearly exhibited periodic emission vs. WD
spin phase (𝜙s) with a 180◦ sweep in PPA. This was consistent with
the light curve from Buckley et al. (2017), where a double-peaked
structure manifested with an intense ﬁrst peak and a dimmer second
peak (these peaks are separated by 180◦in spin phase). These facts
imply that the WD may be an orthogonal rotator if the emission orig-
inates close to its polar caps (Geng et al. 2016; Buckley et al. 2017).
This is also conﬁrmed by more recent observations by Garnavich
et al. (2021) that infer two hotspots yielding very symmetric spin
modulation of the FUV ﬂux, and implying that the hotspots are very
close to the WD spin equator, thus lying near the WD magnetic poles.
Moreover, Marsh et al. (2016) found that the companion has an irra-
diated side facing the WD, contributing to the observed sinusoidal
radial velocity proﬁle. This suggests that the two stars are tidally
locked (Buckley et al. 2017; Takata et al. 2017; Potter & Buckley
2018b).

Several diﬀerent models have been proposed (see Section 4) to ac-
count for the observed non-thermal radiation, placing the emission at
diﬀerent spatial locale and invoking diﬀerent radiation scenarios. In
one of the ﬁrst models, Geng et al. (2016) noted that the Goldreich-
Julian (GJ) charge number density (Goldreich & Julian 1969) of
the WD is much lower than that required by the observed SR spec-
trum and thus argued that the emission should originate closer to
the companion (they suggest at an intrabinary shock caused by the
interacting stellar winds; Marsh et al. 2016; Geng et al. 2016), where
the particle number density is presumably much higher than the GJ
density. However, the majority of models speculate that relativistic
electrons are being injected along the magnetic ﬁeld lines (toward
the WD surface), where they are accelerated and trapped in the WD
magnetosphere (Takata et al. 2017; Buckley et al. 2017; Lyutikov
et al. 2020). These may radiate from near the magnetic poles, with
the emission from downward-moving particles being directed to-
ward the WD. There thus seems to be a majority consensus that the
pulsed non-thermal emission is due to magnetospheric SR from the
WD. This is supported by the geometric model of Potter & Buckley

3 The idea of magnetic dipole radiation dates back to the original picture of a
pulsar magnetic ﬁeld rotating in a vacuum. The frequency of this radiation is
coupled to the rotational rate of the pulsar itself, meaning that it falls outside
the typical observational energy ranges. Moreover, modern ideas suggest a
co-rotating, plasma-ﬁlled (close to force-free) magnetosphere. If magnetic
dipole radiation occurs in pulsar magnetospheres, it should be reprocessed to
accelerate particles to higher energies, and they should in turn radiate emission
at frequencies accessible to multi-wavelength satellites and telescopes.
4 We note, however, that there have been previous speculations of both X-ray
and radio burst data invoking the idea of a WD pulsar; see Section 4.

(2018a) that can reproduce the observed polarization signatures if
the emission location is taken to be near the WD poles.

In our previous work (du Plessis et al. 2019), we modelled the
linear polarization signature with the rotating vector model (RVM;
Radhakrishnan & Cooke 1969), deﬁning 𝛼 as the magnetic inclina-
tion angle of the magnetic dipole moment 𝝁 and 𝜁 as the observer
angle (observer’s line of sight), both measured with respect to the
WD’s rotation axis. We constrained 𝛼, 𝜁 and the WD mass. Our solu-
tion for 𝛼 using the RVM supports the conjecture of an orthogonally-
rotating WD. We demonstrated that the RVM provides an excellent
ﬁt to the PPA curve, thereby favouring the magnetospheric scenario,
if particles can sustain small pitch angles.

In this paper we aim to show that the standard RVM describes the
optical orbital phase-resolved polarimetric observations reasonably
well, reaﬃrming the conclusions our previous work. We also report
that the variation in 𝛼 and 𝜁 over the orbital period is a robust recurrent
signature and we do not believe that it is the ﬁtting procedure that is
compensating for a simplistic model.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, our imple-
mentation of the RVM for the phase-resolved data will be discussed
and the results follow in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss exist-
ing models and current observations. Finally, we propose possible
emission scenarios for AR Sco in Section 5.

2 METHOD

We apply the RVM to the extensive optical observations of Potter &
Buckley (2018b) in order to probe 𝛼 and 𝜁 of the WD as a function
of orbital period in a phase-resolved analysis. The new data include
observations performed on 27-28 March 2018 and 14, 25, 26, and
27 May 2018 with the high-speed photo-polarimeter on the 1.9 m
optical telescope located at Sutherland. The observations have been
converted to Barycentric coordinates; for more details, see Potter &
Buckley (2018b). Gaibor et al. (2020) recently computed the eﬀect
of the proper motion of the system on the inferred spin down of both
the orbital period and beat period. This eﬀect was found to be four
orders of magnitude smaller than the ﬁrst 700 times smaller than the
second, making the Shklovskii eﬀect (Shklovskii 1970) negligible
for the system. The light crossing timescale (𝑎/𝑐 ≈ 2.5 s) is also
small compared to the orbital period and WD spin period, so that
relativistic corrections may be neglected.

The data included the Barycentric Julian Day (BJD), Stokes 𝑄, and
Stokes 𝑈 parameters with their errors, orbital phase 𝜙b, spin phase
𝜙s, and beat phase. Each ﬁle had an accompanying ﬁle with the total
intensity measurement and the total observational time amounted to
∼ 30 hours. As per standard convention, 𝜙b = 0 is set at the inferior
conjunction of the companion.

We binned the data into 50 spin-phase bins and 100 orbital phase
bins. We next propagated the 𝑄 and the 𝑈 Stokes parameter errors
when calculating the PPA using 𝜓 = 0.5 arctan (𝑈/𝑄), as follows

The last term in the above equation only appears if 𝑈 and 𝑄 are
correlated, in which case the error on 𝜓 will decrease. The value of
𝛿UQ was diﬃcult to estimate; since the fractional errors 𝛿𝑈/𝑈 and
𝛿𝑄/𝑄 may be small in some cases, even a small value of 𝛿𝑈 𝑄 may
cause the last term in Equation (3) to become dominant, yielding an
imaginary error 𝛿𝜓. In the light of these problems, we conservatively
overestimated the errors by setting 𝛿UQ = 0, meaning we assumed
that 𝑈 and 𝑄 are uncorrelated and the last term is zero.

Next, we implemented a similar method as discussed in du Plessis
et al. (2019) to ﬁx the convention issues relating to 𝜓 and to generate
a continuous PPA curve. We then double-checked the data manually
to ensure that we had smooth, continuous PPA curves as a function
of binary phase. We then ﬁt the RVM

tan(𝜓 − 𝜓0) =

sin 𝛼 sin(𝜙s − 𝜙0)
sin 𝜁 cos 𝛼 − cos 𝜁 sin 𝛼 cos(𝜙s − 𝜙0)
to the PPA data and applied the emcee Markov Chain Monte Carlo
code (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013) to ﬁnd the best-ﬁt parameters,
yielding 𝛼 and 𝜁 for each 𝜙b bin, using 32 walkers, 25,000 steps and
a burn-in value of 8,000. More dense sampling with more walkers or
steps did not alter our best-ﬁt results.

(4)

To test the robustness of our results, we explored diﬀerent binning
combinations of the the data sets, as well as ﬁtting the RVM as a time
series instead of folding the data using the ephemeris. The diﬀerent
binning combinations are shown in the next Section, indicating that
we found similar best-ﬁt results. Second, we found the best ﬁts for
𝛼 and 𝜁 by minimizing a 𝜒2 statistic and found that the results are
generally consistent with those derived from the MCMC approach,
even if we change the initial-guess values. If the PPA ﬁt to the data
is particularly bad, the 𝜒2 can end up giving best-ﬁt values for 𝛼 and
𝜁 associated with local minima, which is not desirable.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Individual PPA vs. 𝜙s Fits

Previously (du Plessis et al. 2019), we ﬁt the PPA data from Buckley
et al. (2017), which were averaged over a large range of 𝜙b. Here,
we ﬁt the RVM to phase-resolved PPA data from Potter & Buckley
(2018a) to investigate the evolution of the geometric parameters (𝛼
and 𝜁) we previously constrained over a range binary phases. The
panels in Figures 1 and 2 show that the RVM describes the broad
structure of the observed data at the diﬀerent 𝜙b quite well. Interest-
ingly, there is a slight change in PPA structure with 𝜙b that the model
is able to capture, but this implies a modulation of 𝛼 and 𝜁 with 𝜙b.

3.2 Obtaining 𝛼 and 𝜁 vs. 𝜙b
By ﬁtting the RVM to the PPA vs. 𝜙s data at each 𝜙b, one can probe
𝛼(𝜙b) and 𝜁 (𝜙b). In the ﬁrst two panels of Figure 3, such phase-
resolved best-ﬁt values for 𝛼 and 𝜁 are shown. The variation in 𝛼
seems to be semi-stable, since the minimum to maximum variation
is only about ∼ 10◦. The variation in 𝜁 is much larger at about ∼ 30◦,
intriguingly with four bumps visible close to 𝜙b = 0.0, 0.25, 0.5.
The bump close to 𝜙b = 0.75 is not as clearly deﬁned as the others,
but note that this may be associated with the dip in PPA vs. orbital
and 𝜙s around and slightly after 𝜙b = 0.75, as seen in the last row

Figure 1. The best-ﬁt results to the PPA data from Potter & Buckley (2018a)
at diﬀerent values of 𝜙b (as indicated by labels for each panel), where the
ﬁrst panel is at 𝜙b = 0 and the second at 0.5. The solid red line indicates the

percentile posteriors.

of Figure 2 of Potter & Buckley (2018a). In the third panel, these
dips are also discernible in the “impact angle” 𝜁 − 𝛼 vs. 𝜙b. The last
panel of Figure 3 indicates that there is clear variation in 𝛼 + 𝜁 for
the ﬁrst part of the orbital period, indicating that 𝛼 and 𝜁 are not
purely anti-correlated. This suggests that the model is not trying to
compensate for not being able to ﬁt the data by making the parameters
anti-correlating. In fact, the RVM is always able to describe the broad
structure of the PPA, thus, the variation of 𝛼 and 𝜁 with 𝜙b seems
intrinsic to the emission geometry. Relatively large reduced 𝜒2 values
are found at 0.4 − 0.5 in orbital phase (red dots). This is due to the
small formal errors in the PPA at these points in 𝜙b, given that the
linear ﬂux is at its maximum there.

3.3 Robustness of Variation of 𝛼 and 𝜁 with 𝜙b
In order to ascertain the robustness of the variation of 𝛼 and 𝜁 with
𝜙b, and whether this variation is stable, we investigated diﬀerent
binning combinations and diﬀerent data epochs.

Figure 3. The ﬁrst panel shows the best-ﬁt 𝛼 values at each 𝜙b, obtained
with the MCMC code using the data from Potter & Buckley (2018a). The
colour bar indicates the reduced 𝜒2 value for each such PPA ﬁt at ﬁxed 𝜙b
(see Figure 1). The second panel shows the accompanying 𝜁 vs. 𝜙b best-ﬁt
results obtained from the MCMC. In the third panel, 𝛽 = 𝜁 − 𝛼 is plotted

only done to compare best-ﬁt values, without exploring the phase
space using the 𝜒2 statistic). Comparing these results with Figure 3
gives us more conﬁdence in our results, since the two methods yield
very similar posterior best-ﬁt values.

3.4 Spin and Beat Light Curves vs. 𝜙𝑏

To investigate how the emission components respectively coupled to
the beat and spin periods contribute to the linear ﬂux over 𝜙𝑏, we plot
the light curves at diﬀerent orbital phases for the spin-folded linear
ﬂux and beat-folded linear ﬂux. We include the spin-folded PPA with
our RVM best ﬁt, as well an inset depicting the binary conﬁguration
at the indicated orbital phase.

The ﬁrst column of Figures 7 and 8 show a clear evolution of the
spin- and beat-folded light curves over the orbital period. The beat-
folded light curves appear more stable over the full 𝜙𝑏, while the
spin-folded light curves generally move rightward. At these orbital
phases, as well as the ﬁrst panel of Figure 8, the beat-folded light
curves start to move leftward and the spin-folded light curves seem
to be more stable. This suggests that at this region in orbital phase,
the spin periodicity is stronger, while the beat periodicity seems
more signiﬁcant at other phases. Interestingly, the linear ﬂux is also
relatively larger at these phases compared to the rest of the orbital
phases, corresponding to the maximum linear ﬂux in the pulse proﬁle
plots from Potter & Buckley (2018b). In Figure 7, in the ﬁrst two rows
of column two, we see that segments of the PPA are discontinuous;
this is also visible in the last two rows of Figure 8, namely close to
𝜙b = 0.0 where the companion is between the observer and the WD.
To further probe which periodicity dominates at the diﬀerent or-
bital phases, we performed a Lomb-Scargle analysis (VanderPlas

Figure 2. The best-ﬁt results to the PPA data from Potter & Buckley (2018a)
at 𝜙b = 0.25 (top panel) and 𝜙b = 0.75 (second panel). As before, the solid
red line indicates the best ﬁt with the yellow being ensemble ﬁts within the
16th and 84th percentile parameter errors.

The panels of Figures 4 and 5 suggest that the structure over 𝜙b of
𝜁 in Figure 3 is independent of the epoch-binning choices, with the
only discrepancy found at phase 0.7 − 0.85 where there is low linear
ﬂux, causing large formal errors. All the panels of Figures 4 and 5,
with the exception of panel 3 of both, show a peak at 𝜙b = 0.75; the
absence of this peak is also visible in the last panel of Figure 5 where
all the epochs were binned together. It would seem that the peak at
𝜙b = 0.75 is more visible for the May observations; this could be due
to the fact that each March observation was about 60 − 80% shorter
than the individual May observations.

The plots of Figure 4 and 5 were similarly done for the magnetic
inclination angle 𝛼 as well, but were not included here due to the
small variations in 𝛼 vs. 𝜙b. The individual data sets were not used
on their own due to gaps resulting from calibration observations.

In Figure 6 the minimized 𝜒2 results are shown for 𝛼 and 𝜁 vs.
𝜙b, as a basis of comparison with our previous results that were
obtained using an MCMC (log-likelihood) approach. These plots do
not contain errors, since the 𝜒2 method does not yield errors for the
best-ﬁt values, but only indicates a goodness-of-ﬁt value (this was

panel includes data from 27 May and 28 March, and the fourth panel includes
data from 14, 25, 26 and 27 May. All these data epochs were taken in 2018.

2018) of the ten segments used for the light curves in Figures 7 and 8
(for orbital phase bins of 0.1). These results are shown in Figures A1
and A1, where each panel is at a diﬀerent orbital phase. Several
vertical lines are used to indicate ﬁrst, second and third harmonics
and side-band frequencies for the spin and beat periods, as indicated
in the legend. To save space, we concatenated zoomed-in panels to
indicate non-zero amplitudes for each of these harmonics. The or-
bital phase range is indicated as a title, for each panel. For clarity, we
included Figure 9 to show the ﬁrst and second harmonic normalized
amplitudes of the spin and beat frequency vs. 𝜙𝑏.

Figure 5. Similar to Figure 4 , but for data for 26 and 27 May (ﬁrst panel),
27 and 28 March (second panel), 27, 28 March and 14 May (third panel), and
the ﬁnal panel contains results for all seven binning combinations. All these
data epochs were taken in 2018.

Interestingly between orbital phases 0.1 to 0.6, the second harmon-
ics of the spin and beat frequency have a much higher normalized
amplitude than the ﬁrst harmonics. During orbital phase 0.6 to 1.1, we
see that the ﬁrst harmonics’ normalized amplitude is slightly higher
than the second harmonic’s, but both are at a signiﬁcantly lower level
than the second harmonic’s amplitude in the ﬁrst segment of the
orbital phase. Figure 9 also shows that the beat and spin normalized
amplitudes are quite similar, thus in Figure 10 we used larger seg-
ments of the orbital phase: 0.1 − 0.6, 0.6 − 1.1, and 0.3 − 0.5, with
the ﬁrst harmonics, second harmonics, third harmonics and some
side-band frequencies shown. In the 0.6 − 0.1 range, we see once
again that the second harmonics are at a much higher amplitude than

the ﬁrst harmonics; additionally the amplitudes of the harmonics of
the beat frequency are slightly larger than the spin frequency har-
monics. In the region 0.6 − 1.1, the ﬁrst harmonics are at a slightly
larger amplitude than the second harmonics, with the beat-frequency
harmonics being much larger than the spin-frequency harmonics.
In the region 0.3 − 0.5, the linear ﬂux is maximal; Potter & Buck-
ley (2018b) suggest that this is where particles are injected into the
WD magnetosphere. We see substantially larger second harmonics
in this range compared to ﬁrst harmonics, with equal beat and spin-
frequency ﬁrst harmonics, with a slightly larger second harmonic for
the beat frequency compared to the spin frequency.

In Figure 11 we plot the beat-folded and the spin-folded degree
of polarisation as obtained from the observational data. We see clear
evolution of this quantity over the orbital period, with the maximum
occurring just before 0.2 in 𝜙b. Both panels show a higher degree of
polarisation at 0.85 − 0.15 and 0.4 − 0.6 in both 𝜙s and beat phase.
In the second panel, the regions of low degree of polarisation (dark
blue lines) seem to be coupled to the beat period, since these lines are
more vertical than in the ﬁrst panel. For the regions of higher degree
of linear polarisation, both panels seem to have slanted elements,
suggesting a mixture of emission components. For a constant spectral
shape of synchrotron-emitting particles, one would expect a ﬁxed
value of the degree of polarisation. Thus, an evolution in polarisation
degree may either be due to orbitally-dependent depolarisation, or
result from an evolving index of the non-thermal electrons (or a
mixture of both eﬀects). In the latter case, such evolution may hint
at the acceleration or cooling of particles at diﬀerent orbital phases,
barring the ﬁrst eﬀect.

normalized linear ﬂux (i.e., the maximum ﬂux over the orbital period is
unity) in red and the beat-folded light curves of the normalised linear ﬂux
in blue. The second column shows the spin-folded PPA. Both columns range
from 0.0 − 0.5 in orbital phase.

4 DISCUSSION

The ﬁrst mention of a “WD pulsar” producing high-energy emission
via a pulsar-like mechanism was probably made by Usov (1988).
Other ideas invoking WD pulsars were proposed by Paczynski
(1990); Usov (1993); Hulleman et al. (2000) to account for anoma-
lous X-ray pulsars (magnetars). Zhang & Gil (2005) proposed that

the 5 radio outbursts of the transient source GCRT J1745−3009 could
be due to a WD pulsar, due to the pulsar-like periodic nature of the
emission.

Below, we brieﬂy discuss selected modeling attempts, linking
these to available observations. We categorised these models into
three groups, namely: interacting magnetic winds, WD magneto-
sphere and intermediate polar models.

addition, they obtain a maximum Lorentz factor of 𝛾max = 3.4 × 106
by equating the SR cooling and acceleration timescales. From the
spectral peak, they calculate the electron number density needed to
power the emission as 𝑛e = 3.5 × 108 cm−3, noting that this far ex-
ceeds the GJ charge number density of 𝑛GJ = 1.1 cm−3. Thus, they
propose that the non-thermal emission originates far from the WD
surface, rather from the region where the magnetic winds are inter-
acting (a hypothetical high-density bow-shock region), and that the
electrons are injected into the WD magnetosphere by the companion.
However, the GJ charge number density only relates to the number
of excess charges, not the total number of charges, meaning that the
WD magnetosphere could in principle still supply the number of
electrons needed to explain the SR ﬂux.

A similar bow-shock locale for the optical and X-ray emitting
particles is envisioned by Katz (2017), who speculates that the high
spin-down rate of AR Sco may be indicative of it being a missing link
between synchronously rotating polars and asynchronous intermedi-
ate polars. Thus, as in AE Aquirii, the dominant source of energy
may be synchronisation of the orbital and WD spin periods, rather
than accretion. This model attempts to explain the displacement of
the observed optical maximum from the superior conjunction of the
companion at 𝜙b = 0.5. Katz (2017) proposes two possible scenar-
ios: (i) That the power dissipated by the interaction of the 𝐵-ﬁelds of
the WD5 and the companion (that forms a bow shock) is enhanced
on the leading companion face compared to the trailing face, the ﬁrst
being relatively hotter. (ii) Alternatively, that there is a misalignment
of the WD spin axis and the orbital axis, as well as the WD spin and
magnetic axes, and also potential oblateness of the WD, leading to
precession of the spin axis, and thus modulated dissipation, and ulti-
mately a drift in the maximum optical ﬂux with phase. Katz (2017)
lastly obtains a lower limit for the inclination angle (sin3 𝑖 ≥ 0.42)
of the binary orbit using the mass function from Marsh et al. (2016).
Katz (2017) estimated a precession period of 20 − 200 years
(∼ 2◦ − 20◦ per year) for the WD, depending on the relative angle
between WD spin and orbital axes and the WD oblateness. In our pre-
vious paper (du Plessis et al. 2019), we calculated the Lense-Thirring

5 Katz (2017) estimates the WD’s 𝐵-ﬁeld strength to be 𝐵WD ∼ 108 G,
comparable to that found when using a vacuum magnetic dipole ﬁeld spinning
down (Geng et al. 2016; Buckley et al. 2017; Takata et al. 2017).

4.1 Magnetic-Wind Interaction Models

These models place the origin of the emission at the interacting
magnetized winds of the two binary members, where particle densi-
ties are higher and particles could be accelerated to higher energies.
However, that some of these models may have diﬃculty to reproduce
the highly polarized optical emission seen from the system.

One of the ﬁrst models proposed for AR Sco was that by Geng
et al. (2016), where they assume a magnetic dipole ﬁeld geometry
and estimate the ﬁeld strength at the interface of interacting stellar
winds or close to the surface of the companion to be 𝐵 ∼ 1, 860 G.
They take the non-thermal emission to be SR, the spectrum of which
is described by a broken power law, and derive a critical Lorentz
factor 𝛾c = 73 using the observed peak ﬂux and 𝐵 ∼ 1, 860 G. In

SR cooling and the rate at which new particles are injected to re-
plenish the old particles. Garnavich et al. (2019) further show that
by implementing two existing models, the shape of the optical light
curves can be reproduced. The ﬁrst model suggests two heated spots
on the surface of the companion, namely at the ﬁrst inner Lagrangian
point and at the opposite pole facing away from the WD. The sec-
ond is the model by Katz (2017), discussed above. Both models can
broadly capture the light curve modulation shape.

Bednarek (2018) considers hybrid (lepto-hadronic) as well as pure
hadronic models to account for the non-thermal X-rays detected from
AR Sco, in addition to making predictions for the gamma-ray band.
However, recent analysis of the 10-year-averaged Fermi LAT data
yielded only 2𝜎 upper limits (Singh et al. 2020) in the GeV band.
This means that only the lowest-ﬂux scenarios for the GeV to TeV
band may still be viable.

4.2 Magnetospheric-Origin Emission Models

These models place the origin of the non-thermal optical and X-
ray emission inside the WD magnetosphere. Details regarding the
particle injection remain uncertain, but the majority of these models
assume that most of the particles originate with the companion and
cool via SR in the WD magnetosphere.

Takata et al. (2017) estimated a lower limit for the Lorentz factor
of the electrons injected from the companion into the WD magneto-
sphere as 𝛾min = 50, based on the ratio of the magnetic dissipation
power (due to the WD ﬁeld sweeping across the companion sur-
face) to the particle injection rate from the companion surface. They

(frame-dragging or geodetic) precession using the value of 𝜁 that we
obtained from our modelling, and assuming 𝜁 ≈ 𝑖, ﬁnding a preces-
sion rate of 0.8◦ per year for a circular orbit. Analysing archival opti-
cal data with a baseline of 100 years, Peterson et al. (2019) concluded
that the precessional model proposed by Katz (2017) is inconsistent
with the available optical data. Conversely, a recent analysis of the
X-ray light curves by Takata et al. (2020) indicated an evolution from
a single-peaked structure (2016/2018 XMM-Newton observations) to
a double-peaked structure (2020 NICER observations) when the light
curves are folded at the beat frequency, one reason cited being WD
precession.

Garnavich et al. (2019) ﬁnd indications in their spectroscopy ob-
servations of the presence of a slingshot prominence, leading them to
propose that the beat-coupled emission is due to magnetic reconnec-
tion events from the interacting magnetospheres of the WD and its
companion. They ﬁnd that the photon index of the optical emission
changes signiﬁcantly at diﬀerent orbital phases and attribute this to

next estimated the WD 𝐵-ﬁeld at the surface of the companion as
𝐵 = 195 G, and this yields an SR cooling time of 𝑡SR = 400 s, sig-
niﬁcantly exceeding the light crossing time 𝑡c = 𝑎/𝑐 = 2.5 s. This
illustrates that the particles will produce the bulk of their SR as they
move toward the WD, given that the 𝐵-ﬁeld strength rapidly rises.
Their next step was to solve a set of coupled transport equations simi-
lar to those of Harding et al. (2005), used in a radio pulsar context, but
they rewrote these equations in terms of the ﬁrst adiabatic invariant
𝑝2
⊥/𝐵. Neglecting SR, they estimate the radial distance of the mag-
netic mirror point at which 𝑝⊥ increases and 𝑝 (cid:107) decreases until the
particle turns around, at which point 𝜃p ∼ 90◦. In this scenario the
assumptions that 𝛾 (cid:29) 1 and the pitch angle 𝜃p (cid:28) 1 are violated and
a general formalism is required. By solving the full set of equations,
Takata et al. (2017) found that close to the companion, the Lorentz
factor stays constant until the particle reaches the magnetic mirror,
where it emits most of its energy via SR. The particle is then turned
around and travels towards the opposite WD magnetic pole, until it
encounters a second mirror, etc. At each mirror point, the particle
emission contributes progressively less to the cumulative emission,
since the particle energy rapidly declines after each turn-around. The
particles are thus conﬁned to the closed 𝐵-ﬁeld lines until they are
reabsorbed by the companion.

Takata & Cheng (2019) found that only particles with small enough
initial pitch angles become trapped in the WD magnetosphere. They
calculate the radiation direction and Stokes parameters to model the
light curves and linear polarisation signatures of the system. They
also study diﬀerent initial pitch angle distributions.

Recently Takata et al. (2020) analysed NICER, XMM-Newton,
Chandra, and NuSTAR data, ﬁnding that the single-peak X-ray light
curves from the 2016/2018 XMM-newton observations seem to have
evolved to a double-peaked light curve in the 2020 NICER obser-
vation. They propose that this could be an intrinsic evolution in X-
ray emission, due to changes in the emitting plasmas’ temperatures,
or due to the non-uniform sampling of the observations in orbital
phase. Additionally, they suggest that the WD spin-coupled emission
is due to particles being injected with small pitch angles and the
beat-coupled emission due to particles with larger pitch angles.

Potter & Buckley (2018a) observed AR Sco for ∼ 65 h over two
consecutive years. Their dynamic pulse proﬁle images (i.e., total /
linear / circular ﬂux or PPA vs. orbital and spin or beat phase) are ex-
tremely stable, with the same morphology occurring over one binary
cycle, seen over the span of 1 year. Removal of the sideband frequen-
cies (predominantly the beat frequency, i.e., the diﬀerence between
the spin frequency 𝜔 and orbital frequency Ω) yielded enhanced spin
modulation at all values of 𝜙b; such stable structures imply emission
region(s) ﬁxed in the WD rotating frame. Potter & Buckley (2018a)
next applied a geometric model (i.e., invoking relative intensities
for two SR components) to reproduce the polarisation observations
(before removal of sideband-frequency data), namely the signatures
seen in boxes a1, a2, b1, b2 of their Figure 2 (e.g., slanted lines of
intensity or lack of intensity of linear ﬂux vs. orbital 𝜙b and WD
𝜙s. The symbols ‘a’ and ‘b’ indicate two magnetic poles, while ‘1’
and ‘2’ indicate primary (bright) or secondary (dim) emission. They
were unable to qualitatively reproduce these structures when invok-
ing emission sites ﬁxed to the binary frame (e.g., the companion
face or bow shock). Conversely, a scenario where emission regions
are locked to the WD frame seems plausible. They assumed that
relativistic particles are injected from the companion as the open
magnetic ﬁeld lines of the WD sweep across the surface of the com-
panion. These particles travel along the magnetic ﬁeld lines towards
to the nearest WD magnetic pole, while some particles are thought
to be travelling to the opposite pole. As the particles approach the

Phase-Resolved RVM ﬁtting to AR Sco Data

pole, SR cooling becomes more dominant, given the rise in magnetic
ﬁeld strength, causing the particles to radiate most of their energy
near putative magnetic mirror points. As an example scenario, they
set the WD magnetic inclination angle, the system inclination angle,
and a beaming (half-opening) angle for the SR to 40◦, 60◦, and 45◦,
respectively. The emission is beamed in the direction of the parti-
cle’s motion (SR yielding a double-peaked proﬁle for linearly and
single-peaked proﬁle for circularly polarized emission; correspond-
ing to ‘split’ and single observed emission components). Based on
the peak ﬂux intensities observed at the beat-phase range of 0.9−1.1,
they invoked enhanced emission at 𝜙b = 0.7 − 0.9. Given the fact
that the particles are in-ﬂowing, this will lead to an enhancement for
an observer at 𝜙b = 0.2 − 0.45 (where 𝜙b = 0 corresponds to inferior
conjunction of the companion). This is attributed to enhanced parti-
cle injection at those phases where ﬁeld lines from the WD magnetic
poles sweep across the companion surface.

In our previous work (du Plessis et al. 2019), we implemented a
standard geometric RVM, typically used to ﬁt radio PPA data from
canonical pulsars, and applied the model to optical PPA data from the
AR Sco WD Buckley et al. (2017). These PPAs resulted from binary
phase-averaged emission (including normalized binary phases 𝜙 =
0.07 − 0.23). This allowed us to constrain 𝛼 and 𝜁 of the WD, as well
as its mass. Being a geometric model, it makes no pronouncement
on the origin of the injected particles, but rather utilizes that 𝐵-ﬁeld
structure of the WD to explain the PPA sweeps seen in optical range.
Due the large duty cycle of the optical PPA, we were able to ﬁnd well-
constrained parameter values compared to standard radio pulsar ﬁts,
namely 𝛼 = 86.5◦+3.1
−6.0. We were also able to
constrain the mass of the WD mass as 𝑚WD = 1.00+0.16
𝑀(cid:12) when
−0.10
assuming that the binary inclination 𝑖 = 𝜁, yielding mass constraints
that fall within the constraints derived by Marsh et al. (2016). Since
the RVM does not specify if the particles are moving towards or away
from the polar cap, our model is reconcilable with the postulate that
particles are injected from the companion into the magnetosphere
of the WD as suggested by Takata et al. (2017); Potter & Buckley
(2018a); Lyutikov et al. (2020).

−2.8 and 𝜁 = 60.4◦+5.4

Singh et al. (2020) propose two locales containing relativistic
electrons that radiate SR: one near the interacting stellar winds and
one closer to the WD surface. By ﬁtting the broad-band SED using
broken-power-law injection spectra, they infer radii for the purported
emission regions, as well as the local magnetic ﬁeld strength at each
location. Singh et al. (2020) use both these SR components to ﬁt
the observed X-ray spectrum. Comparing the SED from Takata et al.
(2018) and some of our own SED ﬁtting, it seems that Singh et al.
(2020) ﬁt their SR spectrum to the thermal X-ray component instead
of the non-thermal component. It is furthermore not clear what the
model degeneracies are, since this may not be a unique solution.

4.3 Intermediate Polar Model

Similar to the previous class of models, this model also suggests emis-
sion originating from the WD magnetosphere (and particles coming
from the companion) but relies on AR Sco being an intermediate
polar.

Lyutikov et al. (2020) depart from a strict isolated-pulsar-like spin-
down scenario where the magnetic ﬁeld is dependent on the WD’s
spin period and time derivative thereof, since there seems to be a
lack of coherent radio emission and AR Sco is not an isolated WD
(and no isolated WD produces pulsed coherent radio emission). Fur-
thermore, the usual electron-positron pair production envisioned in
pulsars is associated with 𝛾-ray emission, but no such emission has

10

L. Du Plessis et al.

been detected from AR Sco. The scenario Lyutikov et al. (2020) favor
is rather that AR Sco is a most peculiar cataclysmic variable - a tran-
sient propeller system similar to AE Aquarii (a highly asynchronous
intermediate polar), despite the lack of spectroscopic evidence for an
accretion column and presence of polarised emission in this system
that point to the contrary.

The model by Lyutikov et al. (2020) was proposed to motivate
the current short spin period of the WD in AR Sco, which might
indicate a past episode of fast accretion. They calculate the mass-loss
rate from the companion needed to spin up the WD to its current
spin period. Since the mass-loss rate has a dependence (cid:164)𝑀 ∝ 𝐵2
WD,
they ﬁnd that for large magnetic ﬁelds, the required mass-loss rate
is unreasonably high. Their model thus predicts that the surface
magnetic ﬁeld strength of the WD is 𝐵 ∼ 5×105−5×106 G, assuming
accretion onto the WD. Since this magnetic ﬁeld is low compared to
that inferred by Buckley et al. (2017), they obtain a more reasonable
mass loss rate needed to spin up the WD to its current spin period.
However, accretion is not the only way of spinning up a WD. For
example, WDs are born with slow periods, and having a long lever
arm, this facilitates large angular momentum transfer rates via clumpy
mass ﬂow (King & Done 1993; Wynn et al. 1995). Alternatively, mass
ejection could have taken place during a nova explosion, spinning
up the WD. Also, coupling between the magnetic ﬁelds of the two
binary members may facilitate spin-up. These alternative scenarios
may allow for larger WD magnetic ﬁelds.

Within the plasma-loading scenario of Lyutikov et al. (2020), the
red dwarf ejects relatively slow-moving, semi-ionised plasma along
its magnetic ﬁeld lines directed towards the WD. The plasma pen-
etrates the WD magnetosphere and may be further ionised by UV
photons from the WD surface (or other non-thermal photons), leading
to non-thermal emission and magnetic bottling (mirroring), similar
to what was proposed by Takata et al. (2017); Potter & Buckley
(2018b). Using WD atmospheric models, Lyutikov et al. (2020) ex-
tract an upper limit of 𝑇 ∼ 12, 000 K for the eﬀective WD surface
temperature; this is comparable to 𝑇 = 9, 750 K found by Marsh
et al. (2016). Thus, UV radiation from the WD dwarf surface and
non-thermal emission in the WD magnetosphere may ionise the pur-
ported inﬂowing plasma, potentially causing such plasma to be ﬂung
away by the rotating magnetic ﬁelds as the system enters a propeller
state. As the plasma stops penetrating the WD magnetosphere, the
ﬂux of the non-thermal components drops and the plasma becomes
less ionised and starts penetrating the WD magnetosphere once again,
thus resulting in a self-regulating process of quasi-periodic emission.
However, while an accretion disc requires a low magnetic ﬁeld, it is
inconceivable that such a low ﬁeld will be eﬀective enough to es-
tablish a propeller eﬀect; a disc would develop in the absence of the
former, but then this would lead to strong observable signatures such
as double-peaked emission lines, given the orbital inclination, which
are not detected (no broad emission lines have been; rather, those
seen are connected to the face of the secondary). Thus the assump-
tion of a low magnetic ﬁeld with mass ﬂow from secondary, and
propeller scenario due to ionization of the mass ﬂow is questionable.
In their ﬁrst-order calculations (neglecting particle dynamics and
pitch angle evolution), Lyutikov et al. (2020) propose that magnetic
reconnection takes place at the location of interacting magnetic ﬁelds.
Particles are then accelerated and radiate in a local magnetic ﬁeld
of ∼ 2 × 103 G, where the resulting potential diﬀerence is enough
to accelerate particles to relativistic energies. Their model assumes
that the optical and X-ray non-thermal components originate from
the WD magnetosphere, taking a similar approach to that of Takata
et al. (2017). However, they do not include a prediction for the SED,
light curve, or polarisation. The reconnection events are believed

MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2021)

to be variable, given the changing orientation of the companion’s
magnetic moment relative to the WD, and this may be responsible
for the modulation in the observed non-thermal ﬂux at the WD’s
rotation and beat periods. Radio emission is thought to be produced
in the companion magnetosphere, and Lyutikov et al. (2020) do not
expect detectable emission in the TeV band, given the relatively low
soft-photon energy density compared to the magnetic energy den-
sity. However, it is unclear how particle acceleration via magnetic
reconnection may operate to yield the observed multi-wavelength
spectrum. If the plasma is denser close to the WD, this may in-
hibit formation of extended current sheets where eﬃcient electron
acceleration may take place.

More recently, Garnavich et al. (2021) reanalyzed HST data by
calculating the average spectrum of the minima between SR pulses.
When averaged around inferior conjunction, they found evidence for
a quasi-molecular hydrogen absorption band, inferring a WD surface
temperature of 11, 500 ± 500K. Additionally, they infer the presence
of two hotspots near the magnetic poles of the WD, ranging between
23, 000 K and 28, 000 K. They argue that while these hotspots may
be explained energetically by SR irradiation of the WD surface (Pot-
ter & Buckley 2018b), the dominant emission from the region of the
magnetic mirrors may miss the WD surface. Thus, they discard this
possibility to explain the existence of the hotspots. However, one has
to consider that other combinations of initial pitch angles and lepton
Lorentz factors (prior to the mirror, or penetration of the mirror by
small-pitch-angle particles) may yield irradiation of almost the en-
tire WD surface. Building on the model by Lyutikov et al. (2020),
Garnavich et al. (2021) propose that protons trapped in the WD
magnetosphere may escape and heat the WD polar caps. However,
evidence for 15,000 K gas on the irradiated face of the secondary,
though, implies further investigation of the interaction mechanism
between the WD and the secondary. Furthermore, the high temper-
atures of the hotspots near the WD poles would imply ionization of
the gas originating from the secondary before it reaches the WD’s
inner magnetosphere, implying some further revision to the original
picture of Lyutikov et al. (2020). Garnavich et al. (2021) lastly note
that the absence of strong Zeeman splitting implied an upper limit of
100 MG for the surface magnetic ﬁeld of the WD.

5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we ﬁt a standard RVM to a much more extensive set
of phase-resolved optical polarization data on AR Sco. We found
adequate ﬁts to the PPA curve over most of the orbital period. Our
new ﬁts to the data pulsed at the WD spin period point to a WD
magnetospheric origin of the emission. We ﬁnd a ∼ 10◦ variation
in 𝛼 and ∼ 30◦ variation in 𝜁 over the orbital period. The variation
patterns in these two parameters are robust, regardless of the binning
and epoch of data used. Below, we consider various scenarios for
this variation. Figure 12 is an illustration of the system, deﬁning
𝜙b = 0 as inferior conjunction of the companion. Emission cones of
the incoming particles as they point towards the observer are shown
in cyan color.

First, this variation could be due to precession of the WD as ﬁrst
proposed by Katz (2017) to explain the optical light curve shape,
and also by Takata et al. (2020) based on the temporal evolution
of the X-ray light curves. Second, this variation may be due to the
inhomogenous sampling of data over the orbital period. For example,
if particle injection from the secondary occurs at particular phases
(Potter & Buckley 2018b), the light curve shape could be biased
based by observation cadence. Figure 13 shows that for the data we

0.1 − 0.6, the spin frequency and its harmonics are as strong and
stronger than the beat frequency and its harmonics, but at orbital
phase 0.6 − 1.1 there is almost no presence of spin frequency and its
harmonics. We ﬁnd a similar trend in the ﬁrst panel of Figure 10 for
orbital phase 0.1 − 0.6, but in the second panel for 0.6 − 1.1. Contrary
to Takata et al. (2020), our spin component is still present but at a
low level6. A Lomb-Scargle analysis for orbital phase 0.3 − 0.57 as
shown in the last row of Figure 10, reveals that the power of the ﬁrst
harmonic of the spin frequency is similar to that of the beat frequency,
but for the second harmonic the beat frequency power is still a bit
higher. These observations clearly show a mixture of spin-coupled
and beat-coupled emission, with the spin period becoming more
dominant at certain orbital phases. Similar to Takata et al. (2020),
we thus suggest that there could be two populations of particles with
diﬀerent initial pitch angle distributions or diﬀerent injection rates at
slightly diﬀerent phases, and both populations cool via SR. Takata
et al. (2020) propose that particles with smaller initial pitch angles
generate the spin-coupled emission since they penetrate deeper into
the WD magnetosphere and have more beamed emission cones. The
particles with larger initial pitch angles are proposed to generate the
beat-coupled emission, since the emission may be observed over a
larger region of the orbit. This could lead to the variation of 𝜁 found in
Figure 3, as diﬀerent emission regions are sampled at diﬀerent orbital
phases. Fifth, a mix of WD and companion emission might have an
eﬀect on orbitally-dependent depolarization. Lastly, changes in the
magnetic ﬁeld structure due to the interaction with the companion
may account for some variability in the signal, but it is unclear if
such structural changes can happen on the time scale of one orbital
period.

An outstanding question within the framework of a model that
suggests particles are injected from the companion is what happens
to the particles once they have cooled. To address this problem fully,
a more sophisticated model (beyond the RVM) is required, thus we

considered, the orbit was relatively uniformly sampled, except around
orbital phase 0 and from 0.3 − 0.8. Third, the emission source could
be wobbling or may be asymmetrically sampled by our line of sight.
Fourth, diﬀerent particle populations may be injected with diﬀerent
original pitch angle distributions (Takata et al. 2020). In their 𝑍 2

the optical compared to the X-rays could be due to the fact that the optical
data are of higher quality and the non-thermal component is much stronger

from the companion and where the maximum linear ﬂux occurs.

will only speculate here. First, a fraction of injected electrons (and
possibly protons) that are not mirrored, may be absorbed by the WD
(whose surface may thus be heated). Additionally, the companion
may also reabsorb mirrored charges. Second, some of the particles
may be ﬂung into the WD’s wind and escape from the WD’s mag-
netosphere. Third, if both electrons and protons are injected into the
WD magnetosphere, the protons will not cool as eﬃciently. This
could lead to charge separation or build up of charge, implying an
increased optical depth for absorption of SR. Such a charge build-up
may also impact the injection of new particles as well as the current
ﬂow patterns as well as the maximum voltage experienced by charged
particles. Furthermore, an electric ﬁeld will be induced that will help
to ameliorate such a build-up.

To test these ideas, we intend to implement a more sophisticated
emission model in future, solving the particle dynamics to generate
phase-resolved light curves and SEDs. Continued multi-wavelength
observations may further contribute to constrain the properties of
this intriguing source.
