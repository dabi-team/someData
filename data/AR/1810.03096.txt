Abstract. A set of small scale prototypes of Multi-Wire Proportional
Chambers (MWPCs) has been fabricated for the study of various char-
acteristics. The detectors have been operated with Ar/CO2 gas mixture
having 70:30 and 90:10 ratio. Detector characteristic like eﬃciency, gain
and time resolution have been studied using radioactive sources.

Keywords: MWPC, gain, eﬃciency, time resolution

Introduction

The development of MWPC by Charpak [1] revolutionized the ﬁeld of experi-
mental nuclear and high energy physics. It found immense application in medical
imaging also [2, 3]. In VECC, Kolkata we have developed many small scale pro-
totype of MWPC detector for the characteristic study in terms of its eﬃciency,
gain and time resolution with various gas mixtures.

2 Experimental details and the test results

The MWPC detectors contains an anode wire plane in between two conducting
planes named as drift plane and the readout plane. The distance of the anode
plane is 3 mm from both the drift and readout plane. Anode wire diameter is
20 µm and wire spacing is 2.8 mm. Details about the detector are given in [4].
The detector is tested using Ar/CO2 gas mixture having 70:30 and 90:10 ratio
in ﬂow mode at laboratory temperature and pressure.

2.1 Eﬃciency and gain

The eﬃciency of the detector is measured with 106Ru β-source using a 3-fold
trigger setup made up with three scintillator detectors - two crossed scintillators
above and one scintillator below the MWPC under study. The eﬃciency as a
function of applied high voltage (HV) is shown in Fig. 1 for both gas mixtures.
In the plateau region the eﬃciency is ∼94% in both cases.

The detector is also tested using 55Fe 5.9 keV X-ray source to measure the
gas gain. The anode energy spectrum of 55Fe at 1900 V in Ar/CO2 (70:30) gas
is given in Fig. 2(a). The anode signal induces an opposite polarity signal in
the readout. The induced charge is shared by the readout and the drift plane
equally. We measured the charge sharing fraction. This is shown in Fig. 2(b).
The charge fraction is found to be ∼48% and ∼47% for the two cases.

fraction induced in the readout.

The gain of the detector is calculated from the mean ADC of the 55Fe spec-
trum with a Gaussian ﬁtting is shown in Fig. 3(a) as a function of HV. We
ﬁnd that in case of Ar/CO2 90:10 gas has higher gain at low operating voltage
compared to the Ar/CO2 70:30 because of larger fraction of Argon content.

Eﬃciency of the detector should depend on the gain only providing all other
setup condition same. This is demonstrated in Fig. 3(b) where eﬃciency is plot-
ted vs gain for the given HV values.

2.2 Time resolution

Time resolution of a detector is depends on spatial distribution of the primary
charge cluster, electric ﬁeld, gas and pressure. In this study time resolution
is measured with both gas mixture. This has been measured using the 3-fold
scintillator signal as a start signal of a ORTEC TAC and the fast logic signal of
the detector as stop signal. Fig. 4(a) shows a typical time spectrum at 2075 V
in Ar/CO2 70:30 gas. The time resolution (σt) as a function of HV is plotted in
the Fig. 4(b). For these gas mixtures we obtained σt ∼10ns.

3 Summary

A number of small prototype MWPC detectors has been fabricated and operated
with Ar/CO2 70:30 and 90:10 gas mixtures. The eﬃciency, charge fraction, gain,
timing resolution have been measured using radioactive sources. A comparative
study of gain and eﬃciency has also been performed. Gas gain approaching 104
is achieved for both the gas mixtures. Time resolution of the detector is also
measured with diﬀerent gas mixtures at atmospheric pressure and σt value of
∼10 ns is achieved.
