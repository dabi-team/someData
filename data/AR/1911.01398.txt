Recent results from NA61/SHINE

Abstract. The research programme of the NA61 collaboration covers a wide range of hadronic
physics in the CERN SPS energy range, encompassesing measurements of hadron-hadron,
hadron-nucleus as well as nucleus-nucleus collisions. The latter are analysed to better under-
stand the properties of hot and dense nuclear matter. In this paper recent results of particle
production properties as well event by event ﬂuctuations in proton-proton, Be+Be and Ar+Sc
interactions at beam energies of 19A/20A, 30A, 40A, 75A/80A and 158A GeV/c are presented.

Keywords: NA61/SHINE, critical point, onset of deconﬁnement

1 The NA61/SHINE facility

The NA61/SHINE detector [1] is a large acceptance hadron spectrometer with excellent capa-
bilities in charged particle momentum measurements and identiﬁcation by a set of eight Time
Projection Chambers as well as Time-of-Flight detectors. The high resolution forward calorime-
ter, the Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD), measures energy ﬂow around the beam direction,
which in nucleus-nucleus reactions is primarily a measure of the number of projectile spectator
(non-interacted) nucleons and is thus related to the violence (centrality) of the collision. A set of
beam detectors identiﬁes beam particles and measures precisely their trajectories.

NA61/SHINE performed a two-dimensional scan in collision energy (13A-150A GeV/c and
system size (p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb) to study the phase diagram of strongly interact-
ing matter. The main goals of NA61/SHINE are the search for the critical point and a study of
the onset of deconﬁnemnet.

2 Study of the onset of deconﬁnement

2.1 Particle production properties

The Statistical Model of the Early Stage (SMES) [2] predicts a 1st order phase transition from the
QGP to a hadron matter phase between top AGS and top SPS energies. In the transition region
constant temperature and pressure in the mixed phase and an increase of the number of internal
degrees of freedom is expected.

A plateau (”step”) in the energy dependence of the inverse slope parameter T was observed
by the NA49 experiment in Pb+Pb collisions for mT spectra of K±. It was expected for the onset
of deconﬁnement due to the presence of a mixed phase of hadron gas (HRG) and quark-gluon
plasma (QGP). In p+p interactions at SPS energies the inverse slope parameter T of mT spectra
shows qualitatively similar enery dependence as in central Pb+Pb collisions (”step”) and such
a behaviour seems to emerge also in Be+Be reactions, as visible in Fig. 1. The values of the T
parameter in Be+Be collisions are slightly above those in p+p interactions. The T parameter in
Ar+Sc reactions is found between those in p+p/Be+Be and Pb+Pb collisions.

Finally, rapid changes of the ratios K+/π+ at mid-rapidity and (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)π+(cid:105) as function of col-
lision energy (”horn”) were observed in Pb+Pb collisions by the NA49 experiment. These were
predicted by the SMES model as a signature of the onset of deconﬁnement. These two ratios to-
gether with new NA61/SHINE results from Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions are shown in Fig. 2. A
plateau like structure is visible in p+p interactions. The ratio K+/π+ at mid-rapidity as well as

sults are shown with statistical uncertainties only. For the p+p data the shaded band indicates
systematic uncertainties.

the ratio of total yields from Be+Be collisions is close to the p+p measurements. For the ﬁve anal-
ysed energies of Ar+Sc collisions, the ratio K+/π+ at mid-rapidity and (cid:104)K+(cid:105) / (cid:104)π+(cid:105) are higher
than in p+p collisions but show a qualitatively similar energy dependence - no horn structure
visible.

2.2 Flow

Directed ﬂow v1 was considered to be sensitive to the ﬁrst order phase transition (strong soft-
ening of the Equation of State) [3–5]. The expected effect is a non-monotonic behaviour (change
from positive to negative and again to positive values) of proton dv1/dy as a function of beam en-
ergy. This effect is usually referred to as collapse of proton ﬂow. The NA49 experiment measured
anti-ﬂow of protons at mid-rapidity [6]. A negative value of dv1/dy was observed in peripheral
Pb+Pb collisions at 40A GeV/c beam momentum (

sNN = 8.8 GeV).

In 2018 the NA61/SHINE experiment reported the ﬁrst results on anisotropic ﬂow, measured
sNN = 7.6 GeV). Ac-
in centrality selected Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c beam momentum (
cording to the horn structure in the energy dependence of the K+/π+ ratio in Pb+Pb collisions,
this is the energy of the onset of deconﬁnement. Therefore, studying the centrality dependence
of ﬂow at this speciﬁc energy may allow to better understand the properties of the onset of de-
conﬁnement.

√

The NA61/SHINE ﬁxed target setup allows tracking and particle identiﬁcation over a wide
rapidity range. Flow coefﬁcients were measured relative to the spectator plane estimated with
the Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD), which is unique for NA61. Preliminary results on the
centrality dependence of dv1/dy at mid-rapidity, measured in Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c,
are presented in Fig. 3 (left). One sees that the slope of pion v1 is always negative. In contrast,
the slope of proton v1 changes sign for centrality of about 50%. Recently, preliminary results of
directed ﬂow for Pb+Pb collisions at 13A were released [7]. Proton directed ﬂow as function of
rapidity is shown in Fig. 3 (right). The results do not show evidence for the collapse of proton
directed ﬂow in Pb+Pb interactions at 13A GeV/c.

sions at 30A GeV/c (left)and v1 as the function of rapidity measured in Pb+Pb at 13A GeV/c (right).

3 Search for the critical point

An intermittency signal in protons was predicted close to the critical point. This is expected to
become manifest in local power-law ﬂuctuations of the baryon density which can be searched
for by studying the scaling behaviour of second factorial moments F2(M) with the cell size or,
equivalently, with the number of cells in (px, py) space of protons at mid-rapidity (see Refs. [8–
10]). The transverse momentum space is partitioned into M × M equal-size bins, and the proton
distribution is quantiﬁed by multiplicities in individual bins. The second order factorial moment
in transverse momentum space is expressed as:

F2(M) =

∑M2

M2

m=1 nm(nm − 1)(cid:105)
m=1 nm(cid:105)

,

where M2 is the number of bins (M bins in px and M bins in py) and nm is the number of pro-
tons in the m-th bin. Combinatorial background subtracted (by mixed events) second factorial
moments, ∆F2(M), should scale according to a power-law (for M (cid:29) 1):

In the recent analysis of NA61/SHINE the intermittency effects were studied in central Be+Be
and centrality selected Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c. The dE/dx method was used for the iden-
tiﬁcation of protons. Centrality was determined from the energy deposited in the PSD detector.
For Ar+Sc collisions protons were selected with at least 90% purity. Figure 4 shows preliminary
results on F2(M) of mid-rapidity protons produced in 5-10% and 10-15% central Ar+Sc collisions
at 150A GeV/c.

The result of F2(M2)seen in Ar+Sc collisions are higher in data than in mixed events. A de-

tailed investigation of the signiﬁcance of this result is in progress.

central Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c.

A critical point is also expected to lead to enhanced ﬂuctuations of multiplicity and trans-
verse momentum. For their study NA61/SHINE uses the strongly intensive measures ∆[PT, N]
and Σ[PT, N], see Ref. [11]. In the Wounded Nucleon Model (WNM) they depend neither on the
number of wounded nucleons (W) nor on ﬂuctuations of W. In the Grand Canonical Ensemble
they do not depend on volume and volume ﬂuctuations. Moreover, ∆[PT, N] and Σ[PT, N] have
two reference values, namely they are equal to zero in case of no ﬂuctuations and one in case of
independent particle production.

The system size dependence of Σ[PT, N] at 150A/158A GeV/c from the NA61/SHINE and
NA49 experiments as function of system size (wounded nucleons) is shown in Fig. 5 (left). NA49
and NA61/SHINE measurements show consistent trends. Finally NA61/SHINE results for the
NA61/SHINE acceptance for p+p, Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions are presented in Fig. 5 (right). So
far there are no prominent structures observed which could be related to a critical point.

4 Strangeness production in p+p interactions at 158 GeV/c

4.1 Ξ production

Hyperons are excellent probes of the dynamics of proton-proton interactions as constituent strange
quarks are not present in the initial state of this process. Therefore hyperon production has been
studied in a long series of experiments in elementary hadron+hadron interactions. However, the
experimental situation in this ﬁeld remains inconclusive.

√

New data from p+p collisions on Ξ− and Ξ+

hyperon production are presented. The event
sample consists of 53 million registered interaction trigger events obtained at 158 GeV/c beam mo-
produced
mentum corresponding to
in strong and electromagnetic processes and are corrected for detector geometrical acceptance
and reconstruction efﬁciency.

sNN = 17.3 GeV/c. The results refer to primary Ξ− and Ξ+

To ﬁnd the Ξ candidates, all Λ candidates are combined with pion tracks of appropriate charge
(daughter track). A ﬁtting procedure is applied, using as parameters the decay position of the V0
candidate, the momenta of both the V0 decay tracks, the momentum of the daughter track, and

not subject to the minimization, as they are determined from the parameters using momentum
conservation. This procedure yields the decay position and the momentum of the Ξ candidate.

Preliminary results derived from two dimensional spectra (y vs pT) are presented as trans-
verse momentum distributions in bins of rapidity in Fig. 6. Statistical uncertainties are shown as
vertical bars and preliminary estimates of systematic uncertainty are indicated by shaded bands.
The blue lines show results of exponential ﬁts to the measurements binned in mT.

The obtained pT spectra were used to calculate the rapidity spectrum of Ξ− and Ξ+

produc-
tion as the sum of measured points and extrapolation to the unmeasured region of pT. The result
is displayed in Fig. 7. Vertical bars show statistical, the shaded band systematic uncertainties. The
rapidity distribution was ﬁtted by a Gaussian function for extrapolation into the unmeasured re-
gions. Based on summing the data points and the extrapolation of the ﬁtted function resulted in
the mean multiplicity (cid:104)Ξ+(cid:105) = 0.00079 ± 0.00002 ± 0.00010 and the mean multiplicity of (cid:104)Ξ−(cid:105) =

Search for pentaquark candidates

The NA49 Collaboration published evidence for the existence of a narrow Ξ− π− baryon reso-
nance with mass of 1.862 ± 0.002 GeV/c2 and width below the detector resolution [12] in 2004. The
signiﬁcance was estimated to be 4.0σ. This state was a candidate for the hypothetical exotic Ξ−−
baryon with S=-2, I= 3
2 and a quark content of (dsds ¯u). At the same mass a peak was observed in
the Ξ− π+ spectrum which is a candidate for the Ξ0
member of this isospin quartet with a quark
content of (dsus ¯d). The corresponding antibaryon spectra also showed enhancements at the same
invariant mass.

Recently a similar analysis was performed by NA61/SHINE based on an order of magnitude
higher statistics. The ﬁrst step in the analysis was the search for Λ candidates, which were then

combined with the π− to form the Ξ− candidates. Next the Ξ−−
were searched for in
the Ξ− π− (Ξ− π+) invariant mass spectrum, where the π− (π+) are primary vertex tracks. An
analogous procedure was followed for the antiparticles.

To search for the exotic Ξ−−

state the selected Ξ− candidates were combined with primary
π− tracks. The resulting Ξ− π− invariant mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 9 (top, left). The shaded
histogram is the mixed-event background, obtained by combining the Ξ− and π− from differ-
ent events and normalising to the number of real combinations. The complete set of invariant
mass distributions measured by NA61/SHINE (Ξ− π−, Ξ− π+, Ξ+
π+) is shown in
Fig. 9 (left). In addition to the described cuts, a lower cut of 3 GeV/c was imposed on the π+
momenta to minimize the large proton contamination. Blue histograms show normalised mixed-
event backgrounds. One sees that data overlap with the mixed-event backgrounds in the mass
window 1.848 – 1.870 GeV/c2 where the NA49 signal was observed; see Fig. 9 (right). Finally a nar-
row peak of Ξ(1530)0 is observed in the invariant mass of Ξ+
π−. The yield of observed Ξ(1530)0
scales with the number of events compared to NA49 results.

In summary, this NA61/SHINE analysis of p+p interactions, with ≈ 10 times higher statistics,
and their antiparticles. All four

disproves the NA49 indication of the production of Ξ−−
invariant mass distributions shown in Fig. 9 do not show signiﬁcant signals in the mass window
for which NA49 previously reported pentaquark candidates.
