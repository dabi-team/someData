Strong-field ionization is central to intense laser-matter interactions. However, standard ionization 

measurements have been limited to extremely low density gas samples, ignoring potential high 

density effects. Here, we measure strong-field ionization in atmospheric pressure range air, N2 and 

Ar over 14 decades of absolute yield, using mid-IR picosecond avalanche multiplication of single 

electrons. Our results are consistent with theoretical rates for isolated atoms and molecules and 

quantify the ubiquitous presence of ultra-low concentration gas contaminants that can significantly 

affect laser-gas interactions. 

The unification of tunneling ionization and multiphoton ionization (MPI) of atoms in intense laser 

fields by Keldysh in 1965 [1] provided an analytic foundation for strong field laser physics [2-6], 

but  measurements of the transition from MPI to tunneling had to await later advances in short 

pulse lasers [7-10]. This transition is characterized in atomic units by the dimensionless Keldysh 

parameter 𝛾 = (cid:3435)2𝜒(cid:3043)(cid:3439)

(cid:2869) (cid:2870)⁄

𝜔/𝐸(cid:2868), where 𝜒(cid:3043) is the atom’s ionization potential, 𝐸(cid:2868) is the peak laser 

field, and 𝜔 is the laser frequency. At moderate intensity 𝐼 (𝛾 ≫ 1, MPI regime), the yield 𝑌 is 

proportional  to  𝐸(cid:2868)
transition to tunneling and barrier suppression ionization [7,9] is characterized by 𝑌 ∝ 𝐼(cid:3043)(cid:2996)(cid:3041), where 

(cid:2870)(cid:3041) (∝ 𝐼(cid:3041)),  while  at  higher  intensities  or  longer  wavelengths  (𝛾 < 1),  the 

𝑛 is the integer number of photons needed to exceed 𝜒(cid:3043). These early measurements were conducted 
in extremely low density gases (typically ~108 −1012 cm−3) in order to prevent ionization products 

interacting with background  gas  or  experiencing space charge effects  in  transit to high  voltage 

detectors [7,9,11]. However, many applications of strong-field ionization, such as high harmonic

generation [12] or high intensity pulse propagation [13], occur at atomic densities many orders of 

magnitude higher where density-dependent ionization may be important. 

Recent theoretical work, for example, suggests many-body effects in high density gases leads 

to  an  additional  ionization  channel:  excitation-induced  dephasing  (EID)  [14-17].  If  “standard” 

isolated  atom  multiphoton/tunneling  ionization  is  viewed  as  the  result  of  optical-field  induced 

dephasing  of  bound  state-continuum  coherence,  which  spoils  the  adiabatic  following  of  the 

electron population in the strong, highly detuned optical field, then at elevated densities it was 

proposed  that  additional  dephasing  from  Coulomb  interaction  with  electrons  in  nearby  atoms 

enhances ionization beyond the isolated atom process. Calculations [14] predict that the additional 

yield scales nearly linearly with density and is proportional to 𝐼(cid:2870) (in strong contrast with 𝐼(cid:3041) scaling 

for  MPI),  and  is  nearly  independent  of  target  species  and  laser  wavelength.  EID  calculations 
predict yields ~10−9-10−7 cm−3 for 1 TW/cm2, λ=1-10 μm, 100 fs pulses  in a variety of atmospheric 

pressure range gases [14-17], while at higher intensities the isolated atom rate dominates. While 

prior  ionization  yield  measurements  at  atmospheric  pressure  [18,19]  have  shown  reasonable 
agreement with isolated atom rates, they were limited to yields above ~10-5 for a λ=800 nm driver, 

precluding investigation of EID ionization. 

The potential effect of EID ionization is significant, especially when its boost to plasma density 

would  have  a  commensurately  larger  effect  on  the  refractive  index  experienced  by  longer 

wavelength lasers. For example, under conditions where standard ionization is negligible, EID was 
invoked to explain a recent experiment observing self-channeling of a λ=10.2 μm, ~1 TW/cm2 

peak intensity  CO2 laser pulse  over 20 Rayleigh ranges in air [20], a process requiring plasma 

generation to offset Kerr self-focusing.  

In this paper, we use avalanche ionization driven by a picosecond, mid-IR probe laser pulse to 
measure absolute ionization yields over 14 decades (10−16 to 10−2) from femtosecond near-IR and 

mid-IR pump pulse irradiation of atmospheric pressure range air, nitrogen and argon (0.5-3 bar). 

This represents an unprecedented dynamic range with a single setup, with a sensitivity achievable 

by  no  other  method  we  are  aware  of.    In  avalanche  ionization,  free  electrons  (here  initially 

generated  by  femtosecond  pump  pulses)  gain  sufficient  energy  through  probe-driven  collisions 

until they ionize neutral atoms/molecules, leading to an exponential growth factor   𝑒(cid:3092)(cid:3284)(cid:3047) 

in 

the 

local number of electrons,  where 𝜈(cid:3036) is the effective collisional ionization rate. Growth saturates 

due to depletion of neutral molecules  (for example, at 5% full single ionization of air, electron 

2 

 
density ~1018 cm-3 and  𝜈(cid:3036) is  reduced by 5%).  Avalanche  ionization was driven by a positively 
chirped  ~10  mJ,  50  ps  λ=3.9  μm  probe  pulse  focused  to  intensities  ~1-1.5  TW/cm2  at  a  1/𝑒(cid:2870) 

intensity  radius  (waist)  of  𝑤(cid:2868) = 70𝜇m.  The  peak  probe  intensity  defines  a  breakdown  volume 

inside  of  which  the  intensity  exceeds  a  threshold  value  leading  to  detectable  avalanches  (see 

supplementary material [21]). Crucially, the mid-IR avalanche driver eliminates driver-supplied 

MPI electrons from the seed population [22,23].  

Figure  1  shows  the  experimental  setup.  The  femtosecond  pump  pulse,  synchronized  to  the 
avalanche-driving probe, was either in the near-IR (λ=1024 nm, 274±10 fs) or in the mid-IR (λ=3.9 

μm, 85±5 fs) and focused to peak intensities of 1-100 TW/cm2, with intensity control provided by 

a waveplate and polarizer. All three pulses were derived from a 20 Hz chirped pulse amplification 

(OPCPA) system [24], with details of focal spot measurements, breakdown volume, and absolute 

intensity uncertainty (~ ± 10% ) given in the supplementary material [22]. 

For  low  yields  up  to  ~10(cid:2879)(cid:2869)(cid:2869),  visible  avalanche  breakdowns  are  local  to  individual  seed 

electrons, with radial migration of avalanche-liberated electrons limited to < ~10 𝜇𝑚 by electron 

and ambipolar diffusion during the 50 ps probe pulse [23,25]. Thus breakdowns are isolated and 

were counted by imaging, with a 16-bit low-noise CMOS camera, the overlap of the pump pulse 

and probe breakdown volume (Fig 1 (a)) inside a sealed gas cell filled with air, nitrogen, or argon 

passed through a 0.01 micron rating particulate filter. In this regime, the occurrence of breakdowns 

is statistical, requiring multi-shot averaging. In order to determine peak yield 𝑌(cid:2868) corresponding to 
the peak intensity 𝐼(cid:2868), we use 𝑁 = (cid:1516)  𝑌(cid:2868) × (𝐼(𝑟, 𝑧)/𝐼(cid:2868))(cid:3040) 𝑑𝑉

, where 𝑁 is the average number of 

(cid:3023)

counts measured, 𝐼(𝑟, 𝑧) is the spatially varying pump intensity with peak value 𝐼(cid:2868) over the probe 
breakdown volume 𝑉 , and the yield is observed to scale as 𝐼(cid:3040). A counter-propagating (𝜃 = 0°) 

pump-probe  geometry  maximized  the  overlap  volume  and  hence  sensitivity.  As  higher  pump 

intensity  increased  the  number  of  seed  electrons  beyond  ~10,  individual  breakdowns  upstream 

interfered with probe driving of downstream avalanches.  Switching to a perpendicular geometry 

(𝜃 = 90°) reduced the overlap volume ~100 ×, eliminating this propagation effect at higher yield. 

While the small volume for 𝜃 = 90∘ prevents reliably imaging more than 1 breakdown per shot, 

counting  the  incidence  of  no  breakdowns  allowed  us  to  infer  the  Poissonian  mean  up  to  ~4 

breakdowns/shot,  since  a  Poisson  distribution  with  mean  value  𝜇  has  a  probability  𝑃(0) =

1 − 𝑒(cid:2879)(cid:3091) of observing no counts. With the pump blocked, breakdowns occurred in ~1 out of 100-

1000 shots due to probe-induced MPI of a contaminant (see below).

FIG. 1 ⏐ Experimental setup.  (a) Breakdown counting (𝐼 <10 TW/cm2): A positively chirped, λ=3.9-4.2µm, 50 
ps mid-IR laser probe pulse was focused into a gas cell to drive avalanche breakdowns seeded by electrons liberated 
by  either  a  counter-propagating  (𝜃 = 0∘)  or  a  perpendicularly-directed  (𝜃 = 90∘)  pump  pulse  (274  fs,  𝜆 =
1024 nm  or  85  fs,  𝜆 = 3.9 𝜇m).  The  inset  shows,  for  each  geometry,  sample  images  of  individually  seeded 
breakdowns, collected by camera CMOS, and overlaid with pump pulse focal volume (blue) and the probe pulse 
breakdown threshold volume (red). (b) Breakdown time advance (𝐼 >10 TW/cm2): pump-induced initial plasma 
density and corresponding yield are determined from breakdown timing encoded in the backscatter spectrum of the 
chirped  mid-IR  probe  pulse.  Backscatter  is  collected  by  spectrometer  Spec,  with  example  incident  and 
backscattered spectra and corresponding timing shown. Here, breakdowns are observed directly above a ~5 mm 
gas flow orifice.   

As  the  yield  (and  seed  electron  density)  increases  even  further,  ≲10−10  to  10−2,  adjacent 

incipient  avalanche  sites  become  closer  than  the  electron  diffusion  length  and  it  is  no  longer 

possible  to  resolve  and  count  breakdowns.  However,  the  avalanche  is  now  seeded  by  a  well-

defined  local  electron  density  such  that  one  can  measure  a  deterministic  avalanche  time,  𝜏 =

ln (𝑁(cid:3032)(cid:3033)/𝑁(cid:3032)(cid:2868))/𝜈(cid:3036),  where  𝑁(cid:3032)(cid:2868)  is  the  seed  electron  density,  𝜈(cid:3036)  is  the  electron  density  collisional 

growth rate,  and  𝑁(cid:3032)(cid:3033) is a final (detectable) electron density [26, 27]. By employing our previously 

demonstrated  chirped  probe-backscatter  breakdown  timing  method  [23],  we  measure  the 

breakdown  time  advance  ∆𝑡(cid:3028)(cid:3031)(cid:3049) = 𝜏(cid:3031)(cid:3045)(cid:3036)(cid:3049)(cid:3032)(cid:3045) − 𝜏,  where  𝜏(cid:3031)(cid:3045)(cid:3036)(cid:3049)(cid:3032)(cid:3045) = 50𝑝𝑠  is  the  avalanche  driver 

duration, and  ∆𝑡(cid:3028)(cid:3031)(cid:3049) corresponds to the reddest (earliest) wavelength of the chirped probe pulse 
detectable in the backscattered spectrum at a detection threshold 𝑁(cid:3032)(cid:3033)~1018 cm-3. The spectrum is 

collected by a single shot mid-IR spectrometer [23], with setup and example spectra shown in Fig.

1(b).  Wavelength-to-time  correspondence  of  the  chirped  driver  was  established  using  a  cross 
correlation with the λ=1024 nm beam.  

Figures  2−4  together  show  femtosecond  pulse  ionization  yields  𝑌  spanning  14  orders  of 

magnitude.  For  lower  peak  intensities  of  0.6 − 10  TW/cm2,  where  yields  are  determined  from 

counting individual breakdowns, Fig. 2 plots 𝑌(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) for air (a), a comparison of 𝑌(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) for air,  

N2, and Ar (b), and 𝑌(cid:2871).(cid:2877)(cid:3091)(cid:3040) for air (c), all at atmospheric pressure. Here, 𝛾(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) > 3 and 𝛾(cid:2871).(cid:2877)(cid:3091)(cid:3040) <

0.9,  in  the  MPI  and  tunneling  regime,  respectively.  The  corresponding  average  breakdown 

counts/shot  are  shown  on  separate  scales.  In  2(a),  the  curves  for    𝜃 = 0∘  and  𝜃 = 90∘  are 

horizontally  offset  owing  to  peak  intensity  uncertainty  of  ~ ± 10%  (horizontal  bars)  in  each 

geometry [21]. Theoretical isolated molecule yields were calculated using a rate valid for arbitrary 

𝛾  by  properly  treating  the  Coulomb  correction  in  the  multiphoton  limit  𝛾 ≫ 1  [2,6].  This 

“standard”  yield  for  air  (80/20  N2/O2)  and  N2,  using  effective  potentials  for  N2 and  O2 [10],  is 

plotted as the yellow curves in Fig. 2(a, c), with the curve in Fig. 2(c) scaled up by 100.  

Best fits to the data points for all 3 gases give 𝑌(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) ∝ 𝐼(cid:2873).(cid:2873)±(cid:2868).(cid:2871) (for 𝐼 < ~4 TW/cm2) and 
𝑌(cid:2871).(cid:2877)(cid:3091)(cid:3040) ∝ 𝐼(cid:2869)(cid:2870).(cid:2869)±(cid:2868).(cid:2876), with measured yields orders of magnitude greater than standard theory. For air 
at  𝐼  > ~4  TW/cm2,  the  yield  dependence  transitions  to  𝑌(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) ∝ 𝐼(cid:2877).(cid:2875)±(cid:2869).(cid:2868),  consistent  with  the 
expected MPI scaling of 𝐼(cid:2869)(cid:2868) for oxygen, the most readily ionized air constituent (𝜒(cid:3043)~12.1 eV). 

The ~2 × offset between experiment and theory in this range is consistent with ~10% experimental 

uncertainty  in  absolute  intensity  [21]  and  the  lack  of  species-specific  atomic  structure  in  the 

theoretical rate [6]. The range of exponents is determined by the 95% confidence interval for linear 

fitting to data on a log-log scale.

FIG.  2  Ionization  yield  measured  in  breakdown  counting  regime  (𝐼 <10  TW/cm2).  (a)  Breakdown  counts  and 
corresponding yields 𝑌(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) in 𝜃 = 0° and  𝜃 = 90° geometry. For 𝐼 > ~4 TW/cm2 , 𝑌(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) ∝ 𝐼(cid:2877).(cid:2875), consistent 
with MPI of oxygen (𝜒(cid:3043)~12.1 eV) and for 𝐼 < ~4 TW/cm2, 𝑌(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) ∝ 𝐼(cid:2873).(cid:2873), consistent with MPI of a contaminant 
with 𝜒(cid:3043)~6 eV. Error bars correspond to a Poissonian 95% confidence interval [28]. Horizontal bars on the 0° and 
90° plots reflect absolute intensity uncertainty from switching between geometries. The overlaid theory curve plots 
the  yield  based  on  standard  N2  and  O2  molecular  ionization  rates  [6,10].  (b)  Comparison  of      𝑌(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040)  for 
atmospheric  pressure  air,  N2 and  Ar  for 𝐼 < ~4 TW/cm2    (𝜃 = 0°),  showing 𝑌(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) ∝ 𝐼(cid:2873).(cid:2873)  for  all  3 gases. (c) 
𝑌(cid:2871).(cid:2877)(cid:3091)(cid:3040)  for atmospheric pressure air (𝜃 = 90°).  The overlaid ionization  theory curve for 80/20 N2/O2 is multiplied 
by 100. In (a) and (c), saturated counts were corrected statistically, as described in the text. 

These  results  strongly  suggest  that  the  ionization  yield  at  lower  intensity  originates  from  a 

contaminant common to all three gases. Further supporting the presence of a contaminant, when 

the cell was filled with bottled, high purity air passed through a Supelcarb part-per-billion level 

hydrocarbon  trap,  the  ionization  yield  dropped  by  a  factor  of  ~4,  with  the  intensity  scaling 

remaining the same [21]. The gas cell experiment was repeated for air pressures of 0.5 bar to 3 

bar. At all pressures, the yield scaling at lower intensity followed 𝑌(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) ∝ 𝐼(cid:2873).(cid:2873)±(cid:2868).(cid:2871), consistent 
with the presence of the contaminant. At higher intensity, the yield dependence transitioned to the 

MPI scaling of oxygen, as in Fig. 2(a). 

6 

 
 
FIG. 3 Comparison of contaminant yield with isolated atom/molecule theory. Counts in air (𝜃 = 0° , squares; 𝜃 =
90°, triangles) and argon (𝜃 = 90°, stars) are shifted to overlap with theoretical curves for comparison.  The red 
points (open circles) are from 50 ps probe self-seeded avalanches, normalized to the other λ=3.9 μm data on the 
plot (see Fig. S2 and discussion in [21]).  Two theory curves were generated for each wavelength: a 6 eV atom and 
a 6 eV molecule. The molecule calculation employs a shape factor (0.5) to account for changes to its tunneling 
potential [10]. The calculated contaminant yields, together with the absolute yields determined in Fig. 2, suggest a 
contaminant  concentration  in  the  range  10-11-10-9,  assuming  a  shape  factor  bounded  between  1  (atom)  and  0.5 
(typical molecule). 

As shown in Fig. 3, fitting the yield scaling to the standard isolated atom/molecule ionization 

rate [6] suggests the contaminant species has an ionization potential 𝜒(cid:3043)~6 eV and an approximate 
concentration of ~10−11−10−9.  The ≲2 TW/cm2 (red) points with 𝑌(cid:2871).(cid:2877)(cid:3091)(cid:3040) ∝ 𝐼(cid:2869)(cid:2877)±(cid:2876) were obtained 
from counting breakdowns self-seeded by the λ=3.9 μm probe and were normalized to short pulse 

results as described in [21], and are also consistent with MPI of a 𝜒(cid:3043)~6 eV contaminant. We note 

that early MPI experiments indicated the presence of low ionization potential contaminants in all 

laboratory  gases;  these  were  considered  to  be  the  source  for  seed  electrons  in  air  avalanche 

7 

 
 
breakdown experiments [7,11]. However, the concentration and yield of these seed sources could 

not be quantified as in the present work. 

Figure  4  covers  the  transition  from  MPI  of  air  and  N2  to  tunneling  ionization,  with  3 >

𝛾(cid:2869)(cid:2868)(cid:2870)(cid:2872)(cid:3041)(cid:3040) > 0.75.  In  this  regime,  we  used  our  breakdown  time  advance  diagnostic.  Conversion 
from ∆𝑡(cid:3028)(cid:3031)(cid:3049) to yield was calibrated by data from the direct imaging measurements at ~6 TW/cm2 
(Fig.  3(a))  and  previous  absolute  measurements  of  yield  at  ~100  TW/cm2  [18],  with  direct 

interpolation  between  the  points  assuming  a  constant  growth  rate  for  a  flat-top  probe  pulse 

intensity, as explained in greater detail in [21]. Measured yields and theory show agreement within 

a factor of 10 over the full intensity range despite the simplistic assumption of constant growth 

rate. Accounting for the probe pulse temporal envelope and chirp-dependent heating would bring 
the curves into even closer agreement [21]. We note that the growth rate, 𝜈(cid:3036) = 0.55 ps(cid:2879)(cid:2869), extracted 
from this interpolation also  applies  to  laser-air interactions with a  different wavelength  but the 

same  numerical  value  of  𝐼𝜆(cid:2870),  and  can  be  used  to  benchmark  simulations  of  high  intensity, 

picosecond laser-driven avalanche. 

FIG. 4   Ionization yield measured in breakdown time advance regime (𝐼 >10 TW/cm2). Ionization yields in air 
and N2 determined by breakdown time advance ∆𝑡(cid:3028)(cid:3031)(cid:3049),  with theoretical yields overlaid. The horizontal dot-dashed 
line indicates the limit above which  ∆𝑡(cid:3028)(cid:3031)(cid:3049) is deterministically correlated with seed electron density. Below this 
level, individual breakdowns do not overlap during their initial growth phase, and breakdown timing is determined 
by  statistical  placement  of  seed  electrons  in  the  pump  volume  (Fig.  S4  in  [21]).  Conversion  to  yield  was 
benchmarked with imaging results from Fig 2(a) and previous measurements [18]. The points at each intensity give 
the  mean  ∆𝑡(cid:3028)(cid:3031)(cid:3049),  and  error  bars  show  the  standard  deviation  of  timing  measurements  due  to  either  statistical 
placement of seeds (low intensity) or ~5% fluctuations in probe pulse energy (higher intensity).

Our  femtosecond  pump  ionization  yield  measurements  can  be  summarized  as  follows:  At 

lower  intensities  (Fig.  2  and  Fig.  3,  < ~4 TW/cm(cid:2870)) where  the  biggest  relative  ionization 

contributions from EID are expected, pump wavelength-dependent scaling of yield is consistent 
with ionization of a low-level contaminant with 𝜒(cid:3043)~ 6 eV. The 𝐼(cid:2870) scaling suggested by EID is not 
observed, even when measuring yields 106 lower than those predicted [15-17]. The disagreement 

with the EID theory may arise from its assumption of electron delocalization in the atmospheric 

density  regime  and  potential  self-action  (see  supplementary  discussion  in  [21]).  In  the  higher 
< 𝐼 < 10 TW/cm(cid:2870) of Fig. 2, the yield at λ=1024 nm transitions into 

intensity range  4  TW cm(cid:2870)

⁄

MPI of O2, while it is in the tunneling regime of the contaminant for λ=3.9µm. In Fig. 4, at higher 

intensities up to 100 TW/cm2 and the transition from MPI to tunneling, the ionization yield is in 

good agreement with isolated atom/molecule theory. 

We  note  that  avalanches  seeded  by  low  ionization  potential  contaminants  could  have  a 

significant  effect  on  long  wavelength  infrared  filamentation  and  be  consistent  with  the 

observations of self-channeling of 𝜆 = 10.6 µm, TW-level CO2 laser pulses [20] without the need 

for EID ionization. Not only can a long-wave IR pulse easily ionize the 𝜒(cid:3043)~ 6 eV contaminant, but 

the 𝜆(cid:2870) dependence of collisional heating and free electron polarizability [17,20,29] renders such a 

pulse quite sensitive to any free electrons it self-generates and their subsequent avalanche growth. 

In  conclusion,  we  have  shown  that  avalanche  breakdown  using  picosecond  mid-IR  probe 

pulses is a sensitive diagnostic of extremely low electron densities—achieving an unprecedented 

dynamic range of 14 orders of magnitude, with picosecond and few micron resolution. We measure 

ionization  generated  by femtosecond  pump  pulses  in  several gases in  the  atmospheric  pressure 

range and find that the yield at lower laser intensities ~1 TW/cm(cid:2870) is consistent with MPI of a 

ubiquitous parts-per-trillion contaminant, and is not dependent on predicted many body effects, 

while yield at higher intensities (> ~10 TW/cm(cid:2870)) the yield is consistent with MPI or tunneling 

ionization  of  isolated  molecules.  In  particular,  our  avalanche  method  enables  measurement  of 

intermediate  electron  densities  in  a  range  (108-1013  cm-3)  inaccessible  with  other  standard 

techniques without sacrificing spatial or temporal resolution [30-34].

Supplementary Note 1: Beam measurement and avalanche breakdown volume 

The λ=1024 nm pump pulses were focused to Gaussian waists (1/𝑒(cid:2870) intensity radius) of 𝑤(cid:2868)=8 
μm (𝐼 < 100 TW/cm2, Rayleigh range 𝑧(cid:2868)~0.2 mm) or 𝑤(cid:2868)= 26 μm (𝐼 < 10 TW/cm2, 𝑧(cid:2868)~2 mm) for 
𝜃 = 90°, while for 𝜃 = 0°, they were focused to 𝑤(cid:2868)= 30 μm.  The λ=3.9μm pump pulses were 
focused to 𝑤(cid:2868)=39 μm (𝑧(cid:2868)~1.2 mm, up to 10 TW/cm2) for 𝜃 = 90°. Near-IR and mid-IR peak pump 
intensities were determined by measuring focal spots directly on a CCD camera or an InSb array, 
respectively. Pulse duration measurements made with using an autocorrelator (for λ=1024 nm) or 
with scanning second-harmonic generation frequency resolved optical gating, or SHG-FROG (for 
λ=3.9 μm). Uncertainty in pulse duration (±~ 5 %) and focused beam spot size (±~4% due to 
finite pixel size) gives absolute uncertainty of ~ ± 10% in measured intensity values. Breakdown 
occurs  if  electron  growth  from  heating  and  subsequent  ionization  exceeds  losses  due  to 
recombination, attachment, and diffusion out of the laser focal volume, leading to a characteristic 
intensity threshold [1-4]. For short pulses, this breakdown criterion is increased in order to drive 
avalanche to some detectable threshold before the end of the pulse, which in this case was detection 
of  a  visible  breakdown  site  in  images  of  the  interaction  region.  Images  were  collected  at  2× 
magnification on the CMOS camera, and the number of breakdowns was determined by counting 
the  number  of  sites  with  peak  signals  above  20  pixel  counts  after  median  filtering. In  order  to 
determine the breakdown threshold for different gases and pressures, probe pulse peak power was 
reduced until the pump-seeded breakdowns at the center of the probe volume (peak probe intensity) 
were barely visible (~20 pixel counts). This gave a breakdown threshold 𝐼(cid:3047)(cid:3035)~1 TW/cm2 in nitrogen 
and air, and 0.6 TW/cm2 in argon, with a 1/p pressure dependence for all gases studied, in line 
with  past  observations  [1].  When  counts  were  converted  to  yield  during  data  collection  (peak 
intensity typically ~1.5𝐼(cid:3047)(cid:3035)), integration was performed over the volume of the probe beam  where 
𝐼 >   𝐼(cid:3047)(cid:3035), as determined by direct measurements of the probe beam waist and the beam longitudinal 
profile. 

Supplementary Note 2: Effect of filter on contaminant breakdowns and scaling of self-seeded 
(probe produced) breakdowns 

When air passed through the particulate filter was replaced with bottled ultra-high purity air 
passed through an activated charcoal Supelcarb hydrocarbon filter (capable of filtering primary 
hydrocarbons to ~the part-per-billion level) for identical pump conditions (𝜆 = 3.9 𝜇𝑚, 𝜃 = 90∘), 
the number of breakdown counts decreased by ~4×, as shown in Fig. S1. 

Since counts could not be observed below ~5 TW/cm2 in this configuration and pumping in 
the 𝜃 = 0∘ geometry with the 3.9 𝜇𝑚 pump was experimentally difficult, low yield ionization was 
tested using breakdown counts initiated by “self-seeded” electrons, or seed electrons produced by 
the leading edge of the 50 ps, ~1.5 TW/cm2 probe pulse which were subsequently amplified and 
detected as breakdown counts generated by the remainder of the pulse. Figure S2 shows both raw 
counts for 1.5-1.8 TW/cm2, and corrections for the increase in size of the breakdown volume with 
increasing  intensity  and  the  increase  in  the  time  during  which  electrons  can  be  liberated  and 
amplified. Namely, if single electron-seeded breakdowns at a local intensity of 1.8 TW/cm2 occur 
in 27 ps while breakdowns at 1.5 TW/cm2 occur in ~33 ps, the second pulse has 6 ps longer in 
which  to  ionize  contaminants  through  MPI  and  still  drive  a  detectable  breakdown.  While  the 
correction is simplistic (applying changes in volume and timing as a constant multiplicative factor 
and ignoring spatial variations in yield and timing), it gives a rough estimate of the scaling in this

corrected counts giving 𝑌(cid:2871).(cid:2877)(cid:3091)(cid:3040) ∝ 𝐼(cid:2869)(cid:2877)±(cid:2876). To incorporate this data into Fig. 3 of the main text, the 
data was normalized to the data taken with the 85 fs pump pulse by accounting for the ratio in 
volumes between the self-seeding case and the 𝜃 = 90° geometry (~300) and the change in pulse 
length and temporal shape (~1000×). This normalization gives a yield in reasonable agreement 
with the theoretical curve, and consistent with a contaminant with ionization potential ~6 eV.

Supplementary Note 3: Avalanche breakdown timing, simulations, and density estimation 
from time advance measurements 

For  a  single  electron  seed,  the  time  required  to  reach  a  specific  breakdown  condition  is 
determined entirely by the local intensity, which in turn determines electron heating, temperature, 
and growth rate. However, if only a few seed electrons are randomly placed within the breakdown 
region, the time required to reach breakdown will show statistical variation due to spatial variations 
in intensity [5]. As the density of seeds is increased, there is a high probability of an electron being 
found in the region of highest intensity, leading to a deterministic breakdown time.  As mentioned 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the main text, once two seed electrons are closer than the diffusion length, the time required to 
reach  saturation  will  decrease  further,  since  the  number  of  doublings  in  electron  number 
(generations) will be reduced [2,6].  

Breakdown timing was measured by observing the spectrum of pump light backscattered from 
the interaction region. Since the pump pulse is positively chirped to a length of 50 ps FWHM (70 
ps full width) from its bandwidth-limited duration of ~80 fs, each spectral component corresponds 
to particular time slice in a 70 ps window. Energy backscattered from the plasma is detected with 
a single-shot mid-IR spectrometer, with a cryogenically cooled InSb detector, with a minimum 
electron density of ~1017-1018 cm-3 required for detection of the backscatter signal, based on the 
analysis in [7] and its supplementary material. The longest wavelength above the detector noise 
threshold was recorded for each shot, and then breakdown timing was determined by the time-
frequency mapping determined through a cross correlation measurement.

Fig.  S3  |  Single  shot  breakdown  timing. Each point  corresponds  to  a  single probe  pulse  backscattered  spectrum 
measurement, with the right vertical scale showing the longest wavelength detected, and the associated breakdown 
time advance shown on the left vertical scale. For low pump intensities, liberated electrons, when they are generated 
at all, are randomly positioned in the probe breakdown volume, leading to a spread of breakdown times. As pump 
intensity is increased, multiple seed electrons are generated and more are likely to be found at the peak probe intensity, 
which visually corresponds to ~13 ps time advance. As more breakdowns occur, they begin to overlap, leading to a 
deterministic  decrease  in  breakdown  timing  (>13  ps  advance),  with  the  spread  in  points  in  that  part  of  the  plot 
determined by fluctuations in probe intensity. 

For the present experiment, the width of the breakdown volume (region above threshold) for 
driving avalanche and backscattering was ~40µm, while the diffusion-limited diameter of single-
electron-seeded  breakdown  plasmas  was  ~10µm  during  their  initial  growth  phase.  Thus,  even 
when a single breakdown occurs on every shot, timing measured by backscatter will be variable 
because a single pump-generated seed electron could find itself in a range of intensities above the 
breakdown threshold. This is seen in Figure S3, where the points at ~<6 TW/cm2 show a timing 
variation even though there is a ~1 breakdown/shot at that intensity. Once ~4-8 seed electrons are 
distributed in the breakdown region, there is a higher probability that one seed electron is located 
at  the  region  of  peak  probe  intensity,  leading  to  more  deterministic  timing.  Above  ~8-10  seed 
electrons in the breakdown region, there is a high probability of 2 electrons being located at the 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
region of peak intensity and within ~10µm of each other, such that number of generations needed 
to reach the detection threshold is reduced by one. This leads to our estimate that time advance is 
directly  correlated  with  density  for  yields  above  7 ×   10(cid:2879)(cid:2869)(cid:2869)cm-3,  namely  10  times  the  yield 
corresponding to ~1 breakdown per shot calculated in Fig. 2 of the main text. On the plot of time 
advance, this density is then used to match the time advance where statistical breakdown ends, as 
shown in Fig. S3. Yields at 100 TW/cm2 were matched exactly with the standard theoretical rate 
[8], since measurements of O2 and N2 yield in a thin gas jet with a 42 fs, 800 nm pulse at this 
intensity [9] showed excellent agreement with the theoretical rate for this same intensity range. 
Interpolating between the two gives an electron density growth rate of  𝜈 = 0.55 ps(cid:2879)(cid:2869) during the 
probe pulse, which was used to calculate the intermediate densities. We note that our chirped probe 
pulse temporal profile is not exactly square, with a spectral measurement of the OPCPA’s mid-IR 
beam  and  its  near-IR  conjugate  suggesting  more  power  at  the  beginning  of  the  pulse,  so  that 
ponderomotive heating (∝ 𝐼𝜆(cid:2870)) will be stronger at the beginning of the chirped pulse than at the 
end. Accounting for this would tend to suppress the inferred density slightly throughout the range, 
bringing it into closer agreement with the theoretical rate. 

It is worth noting that the backscattering method does not rely on simulations, which in turn 
are  dependent  on  accurate  rates  for  elastic  and  inelastic  collisions,  attachment,  diffusion,  and 
transport.  Nevertheless,  a  comparison  with  simulations  can  give  confidence  in  the  general 
approach. Using a constant intensity of 1.3 TW/cm2 (the peak probe intensity used for high yield 
measurements) in a self-consistent set of 0-D equations that track the temperature of avalanching 
electrons through electron-neutral collisions (heating), and attachment, excitation, dissociative and 
ionization losses, [2,6] predicts a growth rate of 𝜈 = 0.35 ps(cid:2879)(cid:2869) after ~2 ps of initial heating needed 
to reach a steady state plasma temperature of 10 eV. This matches reasonably well with the growth 
rate assumed by observing the 35 ps change in initial density of 2 × 10(cid:2876) from Fig. 4 of the main 
text, which gives a growth rate of 𝜈 = 0.55 ps(cid:2879)(cid:2869). We note that the simulations are sensitive to 
uncertainty in  loss  rates  and  collision  rates,  as well  as  any  departure  from  the  assumption  of a 
thermal electron distribution, so disagreement is not unexpected. 

Supplementary  Note  4:  Evaluation  of  theory  of  ionization  through  excitation-induced 
dephasing 

Excitation-induced dephasing (EID) describes dephasing in a quantum system induced by an 
excited state population. It is a well-established phenomenon in semiconductor materials [10]. In 
the theory of [11-13], EID from many-body effects is responsible for enhanced ionization because 
it disrupts adiabatic following, which causes the transient continuum population produced by a 
strong optical field to return to the ground state every half cycle. Adiabatic following relies on the 
induced  polarization  being  phased  properly  with  respect  to  the  optical  field.  Dephasing  of  this 
polarization results in an accumulating residual population in the continuum. 

In [11-13], the randomly positioned atoms in the gas (not moving on the optical pulse time 
scale)  are  treated  as  a  homogenous  density  of  atoms  similar  to  “jellium”  models.  The  bound 
electronic state of each atom is approximated by a single state, and the continuum states are treated 
in a reciprocal state basis. The resulting set of differential equations (Eqs. (4-7) in [11]) for the 
populations  (i.e.  the  diagonal  matrix  elements  of  the  density  matrix)  and  polarizations  (off-
diagonal  matrix  elements)  of  the  bound  state  and  continuum  states  is  very  similar  to  the 
semiconductor Bloch equations [14].  

4 

 
 
 
In [13], it is argued that interaction between continuum electrons is the most important many-
body effect, so it is what we focus on here. The many-body term responsible for dephasing (Eq. 
(12)  in  [11])  is  a  sum  over  continuum  states  indexed  by  wavevector  k.  Each  basis  state  is 
delocalized. However, it is well established [15] that the electron wavepacket during strong field 
interaction is localized near the atom (particularly in the relatively low intensity range relevant 
here). Over an optical cycle time scale, there is simply not enough time for the electron to get very 
far from the atom. The gas is composed of hydrogen atoms, so any many-body interaction between 
electrons has to involve electrons from one atom interacting with electrons from different atoms. 
In  treatments  of  electron-electron  interactions  in  the  solid  state,  it  is  necessary  to  exclude  the 
interaction of an electron with itself (the “self-interaction”) (see Chapter 7 in [14]). Excluding this 
in the hydrogen atom gas treated in [11-13] would necessarily involve excluding electron states 
corresponding to the same atom, and this information seems to have been lost in the approximation 
that all atoms can be treated as a homogeneous medium. The sums over wavevector difference q 
could exclude q = 0 as is done in solid state context (though this is not explicitly stated in [11-13]), 
but that would be insufficient for excluding self-interaction, because an electron wavepacket near 
a hydrogen atom is composed of many k states. It is possible that self-interaction was excluded in 
the derivation of the many-body term in some other way, but no exclusion of self-interaction is 
mentioned in [11-13]. Including self-interaction would likely lead to a dramatic overestimate of 
EID-induced ionization.
