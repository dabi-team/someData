Abstract We concentrate here on photon absorption as well as electron and posi-
tron scattering upon endohedrals that consist of a fullerenes shell and an inner at-
om A. The aim is to understand the effect of fullerene electron shell in formation 
of corresponding cross-section. We consider the problem substituting the action of 
a complex multiatomic fullerenes shell by a combination of static pseudopotential 
and  dynamic  polarization  potential.  The  electron  correlations  in  the  atom  A  are 
taken into account in the frame of the random phase approximation with exchange 
(RPAE).  We  demonstrate  that  the  fullerenes  shell  strongly  affects  the  cross-
sections,  bringing  in  a  number  of  peculiarities,  such  as  confinement  resonances 
and  giant-endohedral  resonances  and  partial  wave  Ramsauer-type  minima.  Nu-
merical data are obtained for endohedrals A@C60 and A@C60@C240, where A are 
noble gas atoms He, Ar and Xe. 

Introduction 

The year 1985 has been marked by discovery of a rather exotic 
in shape multiatomic molecule C60 [1]. It presented an almost spher-
ically symmetric construction of 60 carbon atoms with an empty in-
terior. This discovery opened the door for detection of other “empty” 
molecules, constructed from both carbon and non-carbon atoms. All 
these  objects  received  the  name  fullerenes.  As  to  the  carbon  con-
structions, in includes now even giants, such as C540! 

Among other unusual features of fullerenes, one is of particular 
interest. Namely, it appeared that fullerenes can be “stuffed” by al-
most any atom A of the Periodic table. One can put inside a fuller-
ene also a small molecule. Inside a big fullerene a small one could 

 
 
2  

be placed also. All such construction received a general name endo-
hedrals and are denoted for atoms as A@CN, presenting an atom A 
trapped inside a fullerene CN. First endohedral La@C60 has been ob-
served one week after the  discovery  of fullerenes,  and  presented in 
[2] 

Endohedral  is  a  very  complex  multi-atomic and  many-electron 
object.  Its  ab  initio calculation  is  very  complicated  if  possible  cur-
rently at all. So, in this paper we will use a simplifying approach and 
simulate  the  fullerene  shell  by  a  spherical  potential,  adding  to  it  a 
dynamic polarization potential. Of importance are the electron corre-
lations in atoms that we take into account  in  the frame of so-called 
random  phase  approximation  with  exchange  (RPAE).  So,  we  will 
treat A@CN as a “big atom” [3]. In this small review we will present 
also  some  results  on  two-layer  endohedrals  A@CN1@CN2,  where 
fullerene CN1 is placed inside CN2. 

The studies of structure and properties of endohedrals are of in-
terest, since they are scientifically exciting objects, they could exist 
in  Nature  and  have  a  whole  variety  of  technological  applications. 
The inner atom A in an endohedral serves as a lamp that illuminates 
CN  from  the  inside.  As  a  concrete  example,  we  consider  almost 
spherical C60 with a noble gas atom, in most cases, He, Ar and Xe, 
placed  inside.  It  is  essential  and  simplifying  the  consideration  that 
noble  gas  atomic  nuclei  are  located  at  the  center  of  the  fullerene 
sphere. It is also essential that the fullerene radius RF is considerably 
bigger than the atomic radius RA. 

The fullerene  shell affects  the  inner atom,  modifying  its  radius 
and energy levels. The Atom A and fullerene CN can also exchange 
electrons, transferring them in both direction and even collectivizing 
them,  totally,  or  only  to  some  extent.  There  are  good  evidences, 
however, at least for noble gas endohedrals, that these effects are in-
essential and the inner structure of both  objects, CN  and A, are  not 
altered,  when  one  puts  A  inside  CN.  However,  as  we  will  demon-
strate  below,  CN  strongly  affects  the  processes  that  took place  with 
participation of A. 

We  will  consider  here  photoionization,  low-energy  electron 
(positron) scattering and decay  of vacancies  in A, concentrating  on 
the role of CN upon all these processes. Among the most important 
effects in this area is distortion of the atomic  Giant resonance, for-
mation of Giant endohedral and Interference endohedral resonances

ditivity in the

It deserves to be mentioned also that an “empty” multi-particle 
construction could in principle be formed from a very big number of 
nucleons, since in them the Coulomb repulsion is much weaker than 
the nuclear attraction. It is in place to mention here that the option of 
a long linear nucleus I have discussed with W. Greiner already in the 
early  ninetieth.  One could  imagine  that  an  “empty”  nucleonic  con-
struction  could  be  “staffed”  by  an  ordinary  nucleus,  at  least  by  a 
small one. 

Fullerene shell action  

The  action  of  CN  includes  static  action  of  the  fullerene  upon 
atomic A photoelectron or incoming electrons (positrons) in the scat-
. This action is accounted for by introduc-
tering process

Here  b  is  the  thickness  of  the  fullerene  shell  that  is  close  to  a

produce  the  experimental  value  of  the  binding  energy  of  the  extra

Fullerenes  are  polarizable  objects.  Therefore,  an  electron  that

In  photoionization  of  endohedral  atoms,  potentials  (1)  and  (2) 
affect the shape of the cross-section, by adding  resonance  structure 
that corresponds to reflection of the photoelectron wave by the full-
erenes  potentials.  Maxima  in  the  cross-sections  that  appear  due  to 
the action of potentials (1) and (2) are called confinement resonanc-
es. 

Polarization factor 

Due to big size and relatively big distance between fullerene nuclei 
and its electron shell, CN  are  highly polarizable objects.  This is  re-
flected  in its  big  polarizability.  The  incoming  beam  of  electromag-
netic radiation, in order to ionize the atom A, has to go via the full-
erene  shell.  In  dipole  approximation  that  is  valid  for  all  photon 
frequencies in interesting for us energy range, an expression can be 
derived that connects the electric field 
inE  inside the fullerene with 
that of the outside E . To simplify this expression, one has to assume 
that the radius of fullerene is not simply bigger than the atomic radi-
R R  . Applying this inequality, one 
us, but is much bigger i.e.
obtains the following relation (see e.g. in [5]):

Destruction and formation of resonances 

In  this  section  using  concrete  examples  we  demonstrate  that 
fullerene  shell  can  both  destroy  atomic  resonances  and  form  new 
ones. Let us start with the case of resonance destruction. As a con-
crete  example,  let  us  compare  the  photoionization  cross-section  in 
atom Xe, endohedral Xe@C60 and endohedral Xe@C60@C240 in the 
area above the ionization threshold of the 4d10subshell. It is known 
since relatively long ago that there the cross-section has a high and 
broad maximum called atomic Giant resonance [6]. Its existence is a 
manifestation of very strong collective effects in the photoionization 
of this subshell. In fact, photons in the maximum’s frequency region 
are absorbed by the whole 10-electron 4d-subshell. 

The theoretical description of the Giant resonance for atom was 
achieved  by  RPAE  (see  [5]  and  references  therein).  Considering 
photoionization  of  Xe@C60  and 
two-shell  endohedral,  e.g. 
Xe@C60@C240  [7],  one  has  to  take  into  account  that  all  Xe  one-
electron excited states  are  affected  by  potentials  (1) and  (2).  At  
bigger than the ionization energy of 4d10 sub-shell, 
FG   is close 
to  1.  In  calculations,  we  put  the  radiuses  of  C60  and  C240  equal  to

FG  factors that leads to dramatic changes. We see that a power-
ful  maximum  is  formed  at  about  16  eV  and  a  prominent  second 
maximum appear in the Xe@C60 cross-section. The cross-section is 
more than 900 Mb that is about 45 times bigger than for the isolated 
atom. We call the respective structure endohedral resonance [10]. It 
is important to note that the total oscillator strength of this resonance 
is close to 30, that is, by a factor of six more than the corresponding 
value for the 5p6 subshell in the isolated Xe atom. This extra oscilla-
tor strength can be “borrowed” only from  the oscillator strength of 
the  C60.  This  is  an  additional  evidence  of  the  fact  that  in  the  pho-
toionization  process in  the frequency  range  of the  Xe  5p6  subshell, 
the fullerene and atomic electrons interact very strong, in fact, they 
became common, to large extent. 

Decay of vacancies 

Here we consider the effect of fullerene shell upon the probabil-
ity of atom’s A vacancy decay. Let us start with radiative decay. It 
can proceed directly by the atom A, emitting a photon. It is also pos-
sible that due to interaction between atomic and fullerene electrons 
the fullerene shell becomes virtually or even really excited and then 
emits  a  photon.  The  amplitudes  of  two  these  processes  have  to  be 
summed  determining  together  the  decay  probability.  We  perform 
calculations assuming as before that

FG   that was in-

troduced in (3) in connection to Giant endohedral resonances.

The presence of fullerene shell can open a new, non-radiative or 
Auger,  decay  channel.  As  an example  of  such a situation, consider 
the decay of a subvalent vacancy ns2 in a noble gas atom. The transi-

 
 
 
 
8  
tion of an electron from an outer subshell  np6 into a vacancy in ns2 
leads to emission of a photon with the energy
,ns np . It cannot decay 
via emitting another np electron, since the transition has not enough 
energy to ionize atom A.  However,  this energy  is enough  to  ionize 
the fullerenes shell, thus  opening an Auger-decay  channel  and  thus 
increasing by many orders of magnitude the width of a vacancy ns2 
in an endohedral, as compared to that in an free atom. In the frame 
of the same assumptions that leads to (6), one can obtain [11]:

Electron and positron scattering 

At  first  glance,  low-energy  elastic  scattering  cross  section  of  a 
slow electron should be determined by the size of CN only, being in-
dependent  upon  the  presence  or  absence  of  the  atom  A  inside  the 
fullerene. It means that the elastic scattering cross-section 
as 
E    should  be  de-
a  function  of  incoming  electron  energy  E,  at
termined only by 2
. This should be correct if the low-

Direct calculations  did  not  support this  assumption  [12].  It  ap-
peared that the cross-section even at low energies is essentially dif-
ferent from a constant value, depending upon inner structure of the 
target, namely, upon whether it is an empty fullerene or an endohe-
dral. This difference signals  that the low-energy  electron (positron)
e scattering process is entirely quantum-mechanical. To find the re-
spective  scattering  phases,  one  has  to  solve  the  following  equation

Conclusions and perspectives 

11 

In  this  short  review  we  present  a  number  of  results  in 
investigation  of  photon  absorption,  electron  (positron)  scattering, 
and  vacancy  decay  with  participation  of  single-  and  double-shell 
endohedrals. 

We demonstrate destruction of the atomic Giant resonance and 
formation, in another photon frequency region, of endohedral Giant 
resonances due to effect of fullerene shell upon the photoionization 
cross-section. 

We demonstrate that the fullerene shell opens new channels in 

atomic vacancies decay. 

In  elastic  scattering  of  slow  electrons  or  positrons  upon 
endohedrals the inner single atom plays, unexpectedly, a prominent 
role.  Due  to  polarization  of  the  fullerene,  the  elastic  electron 
scattering cross-sections acquire very big resonances at low energy, 
and  a  deep  “Ramsauer-type”  minimum.  The  difference  between 
electron  and  positron  cross-sections  is  very  big,  the  latter  being  to 
large extent determined by virtual positronium formation. 

We  plan  to  improve  the  quality  of  calculations.  Expect 
experimental  investigations  to  check  the  validity  of  predictions  are 
certainly desirable.

Walter Greiner – a colleague and friend. 
(Personal recollections based on half a century long acquaint-
ance) 

With the  presented  article  I  pay  tribute  to  my  old  friend  pro-
fessor  Walter  Greiner,  for  me  Walter,  since  we  were  “av  du”  for 
more than half a century. Best tribute for a big scientist is discussion 
of new scientific results. Indeed, each of us is mortal, but Science is 
immortal. 

I  vividly  remember  our  first  meeting  at  the  Ioffe  Institute  in 

former Leningrad, I guess, in the very middle of sixties. 

Just at that time, I was pushed off nuclear physics that was my 
topic before, and have concentrated on applying  many-body  theory 
approach to atomic instead of nuclear physics. Walter was interested 
mainly  in  nuclear  physics,  but  many-body  diagram  technique 
seemed  to  be  good  in  both  domains,  namely  in  studies  of  multi-
nucleon nuclei and multi-electron atoms. 

We discussed scientific concrete problems of common interest, 
such as Giant resonances in both nuclei and atoms. However, partic-
ularly  great  attention  we  paid  to  the  theory  of  groups,  planning  to 
concentrate in the nearest future on starting experimental activity in 
this direction of research. It was not mathematics. We discussed the 
way of organization of big scientific groups that would work not as a 
simple sum of researches but as a coherent well-organized team. We 
both agree that scientific productivity without  loss of  quality of re-
search could be greatly increased in this case. However, it was clear 
that  one has  to  introduce many organization  modifications.  For ex-
ample, Walter  suggested  regular  communication  via,  perhaps,  even 

 
 
 
13 

written directives from the group leader to his subordinates. Do not 
know, whether he managed to materialize this idea. 

To organize  a  big  and  stable  group  cemented  not  administra-
tively, but by interest to work under a respected group leader, with 
members being motivated by love to science, was a challenge. The 
members  of  such  a  group  have  to  be  able  to  sacrifice,  at  least  to 
some extent, their individuality to the love of collective work. This 
was  a  challenge  both  in  the  USSR  with  its  kolkhoz  traditions  and 
habits, and in the western individualistic community. 

We  understood  that  collective  work  would  increase  the  num-
ber  of  co-authors  in  any  publication.  Only  by  including  many  co-
authors, one could organize a brainstorm that would increase the ef-
fectiveness of the research considerably. In such an approach, almost 
each  participant  of  the  brainstorm  would  become  an  author.  Of 
course,  in  case  of  failure,  such  an  approach  could  lead  to  friction 
among participants and eventually to decay of the group. The organ-
ization of collective research with coherent effect belongs to a weak-
ly developed domain of organization of creativity, addressing at first 
the fundamental issues: whether this is possible at all, and could it be 
useful. If we come to two, “yes” than one has to find the way “how” 
implement all this in the real life. 

The great experiment of Walter permitted to give very impres-
sive positive answers to all these  questions. Walter managed  to  or-
ganize such a group that many people considered as impossible and 
even counter-productive. I remember numerous discussions between 
prominent physicist in that time USSR on the subject that was ignit-
ed by Walter’s visit. Not only I, but also my considerably older and 
experienced colleagues were very much impressed by his deep intui-
tion as a physicist and the broad range of his ideas. Let me remind 
you that at that time he was only about thirty years old. My discus-
sions about him with older colleagues, including A. Migdal and Ya. 
Smorodinsky demonstrated that he was accepted as a promising sci-
entific leader, however all but Migdal were sure that his experiment 
on new way of organizing scientific research would fail. Fortunately, 
the big majority proved to be wrong. 

With time, Walter managed to build a great pyramid. A num-
ber  of  his  former  students  and  group  members  became  prominent 
scientists. All this is an outstanding achievement.

During  our memorable conversations,  Walter  described  inter-
esting  formal  relations  that  he  planned  to  have  with  his  students. 
Twenty years later, I had a privilege almost a year to be a witness of 
such relations and found that they were useful and fruitful. 

During  these  discussions,  Walter  has  made  his  prediction  of 
Great  Reunification  or  Great  Merge  (do  not  mix  it  with  Great 
purge!).  In  spite  of  its  importance,  this  prediction  was  never  pub-
lished and even not widely publicized, so, perhaps, I am the only one 
who  can  confirm  now  that  indeed  such  a  prediction  took  place.  It 
was experimentally confirmed almost a quarter of a century later, in 
1989. I have in mind the Reunification of Germany. Already during 
our  first  discussions,  we  touch  political  issues.  When  I  mentioned 
the now late GDR as an independent German state, Walter answered 
sharply, with a knock by his palm upon the table: “It can be and will 
be only one German state that unites all Germans”. This was a pro-
phetic  prediction  of  historic  process  that  seemed  to  me  simply  im-
possible  giving  the  power  of  the  USSR  and  the  East  block  at  that 
time.  Let  me  mention  that  during  this  conversation  I  was  looking 
with fear at the telephone on the table in my room that could inform 
“interested” what we dare to discuss! 

More or less by chance, I have visited Frankfurt in the spring 
of 1989. My hosts were Greiner and G. Scoff. Walter suggested me 
to spend in Frankfurt a longer period  and  nominated for  Humboldt 
research prize. I have received it in 1990 and spent in Germany five 
months  in  1991  and  five  –  in  1992.  This  prize  modified  my  life 
powerfully  and  positively  in  many  aspects.  I  was  very  much  im-
pressed by the enthusiastic scientific atmosphere that I felt during all 
my  stay.  I  acquired  a  number  of  new  friends,  and  not  only  among 
scientists, both Germans and foreigners. This stay was very fruitful 
for me and I am grateful to Walter for this. 

When Walter invited me to come, some of my friends predict-
ed that I would have a hard time since my host will force me to co-
authorship.  How  they  were  wrong!  Walter and  I  had  many  discus-
sions, common interests in  a  number of  directions. It appeared that 
we have almost the same views on a number of scientific (as well as 
non-scientific)  problems,  but  did  not  presented  even  a  single  com-
mon  talk  or  submitted  a  publication.  I  did  not  feel  a  smallest  push 
toward co-authorship. I attended very many seminars at the Greiner 
Institute. What I saw on the weekly bases was that in all presented at 

15 

seminars talks, later published as articles with the speaker as the first 
author  and  Walter  as  the  last,  in  all  seen  by  me  cases,  he  was  the 
main source of the principal idea of the work. 

Walter indirectly, by himself as a positive example, taught me 
how  to  conduct a  seminar  to  make  it  a source  of  inspiration  to  the 
speaker. He managed always to concentrate on something interesting 
and useful in the presented work, finding a reason what for to thank 
the  speaker.  His  politeness  during  pallavers,  careful  praising  each 
speaker, even if the presented work or the talk itself from my point 
of  view  did  not  deserve  anything  but  strong  criticism,  amazed  me. 
Literally, his motto was “Do not forget to say “thank you” not only 
to those who are in power and above you, but also to those who de-
pend upon you”. For me it was quite different from what I saw in the 
USSR,  particularly  among  members  of  the  famous  Landau  school, 
and what I followed conducting my own seminar during more then 
twenty years. 

Several years after we met for the first time, he wrote me that 
moves to atomic physics, having in mind the process of generating 
of positrons from vacuum under the action of strong, so-called criti-
cal, electric field. As far as I know, he was one of the motors, if not 
the strongest one, behind the idea to create such a field in heavy ion 
collisions. This was one of the most important ideas implemented in 
GSI.  Although  difficulties  with  separating  “overcritical”  positrons 
from that created because of collision process itself proved to be im-
possible to overcome, the creation of GSI became a great and long 
lasted success. 

During my stay, Walter several times turned to the problem of 
Jewish Catastrophe under the Nazi regime. He literally felt personal 
responsibility  for  the  tragedy  that  happened,  and  wanted  at  least 
somehow to repair the damage not only to Jewish people but also to 
German  science  and  culture.  It  was  not  only  words,  but  also  some 
concrete  actions,  e.g.  organization  of  long  stays  and  collaboration 
with Judah Eisenberg, and convincing Walter Meyerhof, son of Otto 
Meyerhof, Nobel prize winner, to come back to Germany at least for 
a shot stay. Note that Meyerhof promised never visit Germany after 
he  and  his  father  fled  this  country  after  Nazis  came  to  power. 
Greiner  was several  times  in Israel and  became  honorary  professor 
of the Tel Aviv University. In 1999 he has a plan to divide the Inter-
national Symposium Nuclear Matter-hot and dense, dedicated to the 

16  

memory of J. Eisenberg, into two parts, in Tel Aviv and Bethlehem. 
However,  information  about  planned  terrorist  attack  in  Bethlehem 
prevented materialization of this plan, and all the conference was in 
Tel Aviv. 

Walter  was  deeply  interested  in  understanding  what  is  going 
on in Soviet Union during the period that was called perestroika. He 
took  close  to  his  heart  the  unexpected  hardships  that  almost  over-
night  made the  life  of Soviet  scientist  so  difficult.  He  felt  not  only 
abstract co-passion but also actively helped in establishing new rela-
tions between German and USSR scientists. At first, I want to men-
tion that he managed to bring to Germany for long stays a number of 
that time young Soviet scientists, to mention only a few of them, M. 
Gorenshtein,  I.  Mishustin  and  my former  students  A.  Soloviev  and 
A.  Korol.  They  were  well  accepted  by  the  Greiner  Institute  at  the 
Frankfurt  University  and  after  at  FIAS  that  was  organized  to  large 
extent by Walter. 

His  help  included  not  only  invitations  to  a  number  of  Soviet 
scientists to spend in Germany a considerable period. Together, we 
wrote letters to Riesenhuber, to some other people in the Ministry of 
science  and  Education  with  the  aim  that  could  be  formulated  as 
“Save  Soviet  Science”.  Having  in  mind  much  broader  cooperation 
than science, he connected me to the Deutsche Bank Vice-President. 
Walter’s kindness and attentiveness had no limits and not only 
I,  but  a  number  of  people  of  the  former  USSR  are  grateful  to  him 
forever.
