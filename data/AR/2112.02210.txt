Abstract

The intensity interferometry is applied as a chronometer of the particle emission of
hydrogen isotopes from the intermediate velocity source formed in 40Ar+197Au re-
actions at 30 MeV/u. The dynamic emission order of τp > τd > τt is evidenced via
the correlation functions of nonidentical particle pairs. Assuming the similar source
size, the same emission order is inferred from the correlation functions of identical
particle pairs, where τp ≈ 100 fm/c is extracted by the ﬁt of Koonin-Pratt equa-
tion to p-p correlation function. Transport model simulations demonstrate that the
dynamic emission order of light charged particles depends on the stiﬀness of the
nuclear symmetry energy.

Introduction

Handbury-Brown and Twiss introduced intensity interferometry techniques with pho-
tons detected by telescopes located at short distance as compared to the size of stars
[1,2]. Since then the HBT method has found numerous applications in various ﬁelds,
ranging from quantum optics [3], cold atom physics [4,5] to nuclear [6,7] and particle
physics [8,9]. In nuclear physics, the correlation function (CF), usually at small relative
momentum or small angle, has been widely explored to infer the space-time dimension
of the emitting source formed in heavy ion collisions (HIC) over a wide energy range.
Here, unlike in the original application in astronomy, the temporal evolution of the
source, as well as the ﬁnal state interaction (FSI) between the correlated particles,
take eﬀect on the CFs [6]. For the review one can refer to [10,11]. At relativistic en-
ergies, CF technique has been developed to extract the spatial extent of the source
[12,13,14] and to image the anisotropic shape of the ﬁre ball[15,16]. Besides the studies
on the space-time characteristics of the relativistic HICs, CFs are also investigated
extensively to deduce the interaction properties of the particle pair. For instance, the
interaction between anti-protons are conﬁrmed the same as the protons [17]. Λ − Λ
interaction has been studied via the CFs of Λ pairs[18]. An earlier review of the studies
on CFs at relativistic energies can be found in [11]. At Fermi energies, CFs of neutrons,
light charged particles (LCPs) and intermediate mass fragments (IMFs) have been ex-
tensively measured, too. It has been found that the emission time of IMFs is about 100
fm/c [19,20,21,22], characterizing the time scale of multifragmentation [23,24]. It turns
that the CFs are dependent on the emitting source. In 129Xe +nat Sn at 50 MeV/u, the
emission time of the fast hot protons from an out-of-equilibrium source is much shorter
than that from an equilibrium source [25]. The physical content of the pp (and other
like-particle) CFs in the presence of fast dynamical and slow secondary decay emitting
sources has been discussed, suggesting that the height and width of the CFs can be

2

used to decompose the diﬀerent sources [26]. CF analysis of massive fragments reveals
the short time scale and dissipative feature of the emission of fragments in the dynamic
PLF ﬁssion in 124Sn +64 Ni at 35 MeV/u [27].

With the ability to image the femtoscopic nuclear system created in HIC at sub-
zeptosecond time scale, the HBT method may provide a novel opportunity to explore
the isospin dynamics. The transport of the isospin degree of freedom is the eﬀect of
the nuclear symmetry energy Esym(ρ), which attracts a burst of interest in both as-
trophysics and nuclear physics for the discovery of the neutron star merging event
GW170817 [28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36]. Despite of great experimental and theoretical
remains one of the most unknown ingredients in nuclear equation
progress, Esym(ρ)
of state (EOS) [37,38,39]. More accurate constraint of Esym(ρ) requires further inves-
tigations of the ﬁne isospin eﬀect originating from Esym(ρ), for instance, the diﬀerent
transport behavior of neutrons and protons, either free or bounded in light clusters, in
heavy ion reactions [40,41,42].

Such investigations require isospin chronology, by which the CF method provides a
solution determining quantitatively the emission time scale of light particles with dif-
ferent N/Z. The resolution of the CF method reaches a few fm/c. For instance, at SIS
energies, the emission order of p, d, t, 3He and 4He has been established by comparing
correlations of particles with relative momenta parallel and anti-parallel to the center-
of-mass velocity of the unlike particle pairs. It is found that the deduced space-time
diﬀerences of LCP emitting sources allow two complementary scenarios which are at-
tributed to the duality of the space and time undistinguishable from each other [43]. At
Fermi energies, by measuring the CFs of p-p, n-p and p-d in 36Ar+27Al (N/Z = 1.03)
at 61 MeV/u, it is shown that for the dynamic emissions, the emission time constant
satisﬁes τn < τd < τp [44]. Besides, CFs of light particles as well as of IMFs exhibit
the dependence on the initial N/Z of the reaction system, indicating that Esym(ρ) is
playing a role [45,46,47].

Despite of such potential ability, using the CF method to quantify the eﬀect of Esym(ρ) is
very diﬃcult. Based on transport model simulations, it has been reported that the
stiﬀness of Esym(ρ) does aﬀect the CFs of n-p, p-p and n-n pairs [48]. However, once
the momentum dependent interaction is taken into account, the eﬀect of Esym(ρ)
is
washed out signiﬁcantly as in the case of 52Ca +48 Ca at 80 MeV/u according to the
same transport model calculations[49], particularly for the less energetic particles. An-
gular dependence in laboratory of the CFs is reportedly stronger than the isospin eﬀect
[50]. Even more, the radial expansion and the secondary decay may further wash out
the eﬀect of Esym(ρ) too [51].

The above diﬃculties suggest that the Esym(ρ) is not the only unknown quantity in
heavy ion reactions. It is intriguing to invest further systematic eﬀorts in the studies of
the CFs with an upgraded detection system. Our motivation here is to measure the CFs
of the Z = 1 isotopes in a heavier system where the Esym(ρ) eﬀect can be enhanced
because of the more neutron-rich environment created with larger space-time extension.
In addition, it is also intended to clarify whether the positive d-d correlation peak

3

exists since some previous experimental results have negated the theoretic prediction.
In this letter, we present the CFs of the identical and nonidentical particle pairs of
the hydrogen isotopes in 30 MeV/u 40Ar+197Au reactions (N/Z = 1.44). An isospin-
dependent sequence of particle emission has been conﬁrmed. The Koonin-Pratt (K-P)
equation, which connects the CF with the source function and the kernel function as
shown by Eq. (3) later in section 3, has been applied to ﬁt the p-p CF to extract the
emission time constant τp. The positive correlations on d-d and t-t CFs are suggestively
presented and discussed.

Experimental setup

The experiment was performed with the Compact Spectrometer for Heavy IoN Exper-
iment (CSHINE) installed at the ﬁnal focal plane of the Radioactive Ion Beam Line at
Lanzhou (RIBLL-1). The argon beam with 30 MeV/u incident energy was delivered
by the Heavy Ion Research Facility at Lanzhou (HIRFL) bombarding on a gold target
with the thickness of 1 mg/cm2. The ﬁrst phase setup of CSHINE was installed [52].
The ﬁssion fragments (FFs) were measured by three parallel plate avalanche counters
(PPACs) with the sensitive area of 240 × 280 mm2, delivering the position and the
timing information of the coincident FFs. The main PPAC was centered at θlab = 50◦,
while the other two coincident PPACs were centered at θlab = 40◦ and 95◦ on the other
side of the beam. The perpendicular distances of the PPACs to the target were equally
427.5 mm and all the centers of the sensitive areas were in the same horizontal level.
The LCPs at midrapidity were measured by two telescopes, each consisting of two sili-
con strip detectors (SSDs) and one layer of CsI(Tl) array containing 3×3 units read out
by photo diode (PD). The ﬁrst layer of the SSD was a single-sided silicon strip detector
(SSSSD) of 32 strips with the thickness of 65 µm. The second layer, with the thickness
of 1540 µm, was a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSSD) of 32 strips on both
sides. The sensitive area Sa, the distance d, the polar angle θlab and the azimuth φlab
of the two SSD telescopes are listed in table I. Three small silicon telescopes consisting
of two Si(Au) barrier detectors and one CsI(Tl) unit was placed at large angles with
θlab = 90◦, 120◦ and 128◦, to measure the evaporated LCPs. The geometry of detectors
were determined by mechanical machining, and the overall accuracy is better than 1
mm.

The correlation functions of LCPs are measured by the SSD telescopes, as schematically
displayed in Fig. 1 (a). The strip widthes of both SSDs are 2mm and the interstrip
distance is 0.1 mm. With the pixel size of 2 × 2 mm2, the angular resolution of 0.7◦
of the LCPs was achieved in the experiment. The SSDs were calibrated by combining
the precise pulser generator and the 239Pu α source. The thicknesses of the mylar
foil (≈ 4µm) and the dead layer (≈ 0.6µm [53]) of SSD detector are corrected. After
the SSDs with well-deﬁned thickness were calibrated, the energy deposit in CsI(Tl)
units could be calculated using the program LISE++ [54] and then calibrated through
the ∆E2 − ECsI band for each isotope. For each telescope, the total uncertainty of the

4

energy of LCPs, which was largely contributed by the CsI(Tl) unit, was estimated to 2%
according to the Monte-Carlo simulation studies reproducing the width of the isotope
bands on the ∆E2 −ECsI plot. The mass resolution of ∆M = 0.1 for α particle was then
obtained [52]. Fig. 1 (b) presents the ∆E2 − ECsI scattering plot of one CsI(Tl) unit
in SSD telescope 2. It is shown that the isotopes of Z = 1 and 2 are clearly identiﬁed.
Here the non-uniformity of the thin SSSSD is not corrected. Fig. 1 (c) presents the
energy spectra of p, d and t. It is shown that the low energy parts for each isotopes
are undetected, because the high voltage for the ﬁrst layer of the SSD telescopes did
not work during the experiment and only the particles penetrating through the second
layer were analyzed here.

In the data analysis, we focus on the track recognition and reconstruction in the events
with multi hits in SSD telescopes. One ﬁrst counts the ﬁre multiplicity in the CsI(Tl)
array, and then looks for the ﬁred strips crossing the area which matches geometrically
to each individual ﬁred CsI(Tl) unit. The pixel of 2 × 2 mm2 at the crossing point of
the front strip and the rear strip of the DSSSD deﬁnes the hit position. Special check of
signal sharing is conducted. In case that two neighboring strips are ﬁred, the energies
are summed to form a single hit if the smaller signal is below a given ratio (85% in
the analysis) of the larger one on the neighboring. A good track (hit) on the DSSSD
requires that the relative diﬀerence of the signal amplitude between the front and the

5

because two or more DSSSD hits are recognized in the area corresponding to one single
CsI(Tl) unit.

Considering the current angular range 20◦ − 60◦ and the high energy threshold in
current experiment, the LCPs are originated mainly from the intermediate velocity
source. According to the moving-source ﬁt in previous experiment of the same re-
action, where low energy part of the spectra were well covered, the target-like (TL)
evaporation contributes less than 10% in the phase space the SSD telescopes covered
[41,55]. The projectile-like (PL) source may contribute to the CF in the area of large
relative momentum if one particle from PL source is measured, see later discussions in
Fig. 2.

3 Results and Discussions

Since the event statistics of the 4-body coincidence, i.e., 2 LCPs in SSD telescopes and
2 FFs in PPACs, does not suﬃce, only the LCP-LCP two-body coincidence events are
presented. When two LCPs were identiﬁed in the SSD telescopes, the reduced relative
momentum q can be approximated to the non-relativistic form as

q = µ (p1/m1 − p2/m2)

(1)

where mi and pi represent the mass and momentum of the two particles marked by
i = 1 and 2, respectively. µ is the reduced mass. The CF is constructed by

1 + R(q) = CN

Ycon(p1, p2)
Ymix(p1, p2)

(2)

where the numerator Ycon is the coincident yield with the particle pair ﬂying with
momenta p1 and p2, respectively, while the denominator Ymix(p1, p2) are the yield
product of particle 1 and 2 taken from mixing events in the same data sample. CN is
the normalization factor to ensure R(q) = 0 at suﬃciently large q.

To extract the space-time extension of the source, the correlation function can be ﬁtted
using the angle-averaged Koonin-Pratt equation [61] as following

1 + R(q) = 1 + 4π

(cid:90)

S(r, t) · K(r, q)drdt

(3)

where S is the source function characterizing the space-time extension of the source
and K is the Kernel function carrying all the information about the wave function of
the particle pair and the mutual Coulomb and nuclear FSI, respectively. Applying a
Gaussian form to both the size and the time evolution, the source function is written
as

(cid:16)

−r2/2σ2

r − t2/2τ 2(cid:17)

(4)

where σr is the width of the source size and τ is the emission time constant.

The scheme to construct mixing event spectra is essential in the correlation function
analysis, as summarized in Fig. 2. Panel (a) presents the scattering plot of the total
momentum P and the relative momentum q of the two correlated protons. Two main
bands are visible. The upper one, with larger P in clearer coincidence with q, repre-
sents the events with two protons recorded in the same SSD telescope, while the lower
one, with smaller P but larger q represents those recorded by the two SSD telescopes,
respectively. The light gap between the two bands are due to the dead area between
the two telescopes. Panel (b) presents the P −q scattering plot by randomly mixing the
pairs from two successive events in the same data sample as in panel (a). The distri-
bution exhibits similar feature. Panel (c) presents the P − q scattering plot by picking
the two protons from diﬀerent events in the inclusive one-body measurement. In com-
parison with the mixing spectra in panel (b), the distribution shows more complicated
components. An obvious components is seen at very large q but relatively lower total
momentum P , suggesting that one of the protons may come from a PL emission which
sees higher possibility to be recorded in the inclusive events. In our analysis, the same
data sample is used to construct the yield product Ymix(p1, p2) in the denominator of
ansatz (2). The validity of the same scheme has been veriﬁed in [56,57].

scattering plot of the protons picked in mixing events in the same data sample of the two-body
events. (c) P − q scattering plot of the protons from mixing inclusive events.

The CFs of α-α and d-α CFs are constructed to verify the scheme of the event mixing
and the calibration of the detector, as presented in Fig. 3 (a). The three peaks at
q ≈ 15, 42 and 100 MeV/c, corresponding to the 8Be ground state, the excited states
of E = 2.43 MeV in 9Be and E = 3.04 MeV in 8Be, are clearly presented. Similarly,
the q ≈ 39 MeV/c peak, corresponding to 2.19 MeV excited state of 6Li on d-α CF is
presented in Fig. 3 (b). The position of the d-α peak (expected at q = 42 MeV/c) is
slightly shifted to left by about 1 bin, possibly due to the inaccuracy of the calibration
and possibly the collective motion [51]. The relative yield of the ﬁrst peak of the 8Be
ground state is not so enhanced as in literature, because only the α particles at high
energy part are measured. Besides, the CF strength 1+R(q) situate constantly at unity
at large relative momentum q, indicating the feasibility of the mixing event scheme,
and the energy and momentum conservation induced correlations (EMCIC) may bring
insigniﬁcant inﬂuence [58].

reactions. The individual peaks corresponding to diﬀerent states are indicated.

We now investigate the emission sequence of the hydrogen isotopes. With less space-
time ambiguity, the emission sequence of diﬀerent particles can be inferred by compar-
ing the CF of the nonidentical particle pair with diﬀerent velocity gates [59]. Consider-
ing two unlike particles marked by 1 and 2 in a classical view, as shown schematically
in Fig. 4 (a), if the particle 1 is emitted averagely later than particle 2, i.e., τ1 > τ2,
the (anti)correlation will be stronger for the group of events with v1 > v2 where v
denotes the velocity, because particle 1 catches up with particle 2 during the ﬂight
and the ﬁnal-state interaction (FSI) between the particle pair is then expected strong.
On the contrary, the (anti)correlation is reduced with v1 < v2 because the distance
between them increases with time. Else if τ1 < τ2 satisﬁes, the (anti)correlation will
be stronger with v1 < v2. We note here that the analysis is not done for the 4-body
correlations due to the insuﬃcient statistics. It is assumed that diﬀerent particle pairs
do not diﬀerentiate the ﬁne division of the reaction centrality.

Fig. 4 (b − d) present the velocity-gated CFs of p-d, p-t and d-t pairs, respectively.
The velocity gate conditions are indicated in each panel. For p-d pair, in the group
with vp > vd condition, the Coulomb anti-correlation is stronger at lower q and the
positive correlation in the vicinity of q = 50 MeV/c is shown. In the group of vp < vd,
however, the Coulomb anti-correlation is weaker at lower q and the positive correla-
tion disappears. The discernible diﬀerence of the correlation strength between the two
groups suggests that protons are emitted averagely later according to the above cri-
teria, i.e., τd < τp, which is in accordance with earlier experimental result in Ar+Ag
at 34 MeV/u [60]. Very similar trend can be found for p-t pair, where the diﬀerence
between the two CFs is more pronounced, supporting similarly τt < τp. For d-t pair,
the position of the peak in the vicinity of q = 70 MeV/c shown in the group of vd > vt
accords with the contribution originating from the loosely bound 5He. Similarly, the
correlation is stronger in the group of vd > vt and τt < τd is correspondingly inferred.
Combined, the emission sequence of τt < τd < τp is evidenced in agreement with the
order of dynamic emission τn < τd < τp established in 36Ar+27Al (N/Z = 1.03) where
the neutron emission time constant has also been extracted [44].

The emission time constant of a certain species can be extracted from the correlation
function of the identical particle pair. Fig. 5 presents the p-p correlation function
in comparison with the calculations using Correlation After Burner code (CRAB).
The positive correlation peak at q ≈ 20 MeV/c is attributed to the S-wave nuclear

attraction between the protons. It is well known that the space-time ambiguity exists
since the source size r and the time constant of the particle emission τ are correlated
[62]. Such ambiguity can be discriminated partly by the directional cut analysis on the
relative velocity [63] . But the statistics here does not allow us for the ﬁne analysis.
So before inferring the space-time extension of the source, which is assumed to be the
intermediate velocity source (midrapidity source) since the high energy protons are
mainly measured in the experiment, we ﬁrst estimate the size of the source containing
the transferred projectile nucleons and the target nucleons of the same amount. The
mass number of the source reads

As = 2 × Ap × LM T

(5)

where LMT is the linear momentum transfer. Assuming the most probable momentum
transfer of 75%, one writes As = 60 and the static radius is about r = 4.8 fm.

Fig. 5 (a) ﬁrst presents the comparison of the p-p CF to CRAB calculation [64,65] by
ﬁxing the emission time constant at τ = 0. The ﬁt with a Gaussian standard width
σr = 3.2 fm reproduces the height of the CF but the shape is slightly oﬀ. Then, if
releasing the condition of τ = 0, one expects to obtain a smaller source size and a ﬁnite
emission time. Panels (b-d) presents the results by varying the τ at given geometric
size parameter σr = 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 fm, respectively. As shown, at all σr settings,
the calculation can reproduce the experimental CF reasonably well. Surveying more
carefully, it is found that at σr = 2.0 fm, the shape of ﬁt starts to deviate from the
right descent of the experimental CF although the height coincide with the data points.
With a Gaussian standard width σr = 1.6 fm the best ﬁt situates at τp = 100 fm/c.
An uncertainty of ±50 fm/c is allowed if one takes into account the variation of the
size parameter. The value of τp are consistent with the prediction of transport model
simulations based on coalescence scheme of clustering [66]. In addition, the value of

9

𝑣1>𝑣2𝑣1<𝑣2𝑣1𝑣2𝑣2𝑣1source𝑣p𝑣d𝑣p𝑣d𝑣p𝑣t𝑣p𝑣t𝑣d𝑣t𝑣d𝑣tτp is comparable to the time that the projectile traverses the target region, suggesting
again that the contributions from PL and TL evaporation are insigniﬁcant because
these two sources experience mainly evaporation process characterized by much larger
time scale. We recall here that ansatz (4) is a simpliﬁed way to characterize the space-
time extension of the source. The possible mixing of diﬀerent emitting source and the
collective motion of the participant zone may brings some inﬂuence to the modeling of
the source, but the magnitude of τ is unlikely changed dramatically. Alternatively, the
imaging technique extracts the source proﬁle by a numerical inversion of K-P equation
without introducing a priori assumptions on the source shape [26].

calculations by varying the emission time constant τp with diﬀerent Gaussian parameter σr
of the spatial extension of the source. Panel (a) presents the calculation results with diﬀerent
source size assuming zero emission time scale. Panels (b-d) present the results by varying τp
at σr = 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 fm, respectively.

Fig. 6 presents the experimental CFs of d-d and t-t in comparison to p-p. It is clear
that the Coulomb anti-correlation at small q, visible for all pairs, increases successively
from proton to deuteron and triton. Given that the Coulomb force between the particle
pair is the same for p-p, d-d and t-t, which are all Z = 1 isotopes, the evolution of
the strength of the Coulomb anti-correlation further is consistent with the particle
emission hierarchy that the neutron-rich triton are emitted with an averagely shorter
time constant than that of deuteron and proton, in agreement with the observation of
Fig. 5. The increasing anti-correlation from p-p to d-d and t-t pairs is consistent with
the experimental observation in 40Ar+Ag at lower beam energy, where faster emission
of t and d was also suggested [67]. One shall keep cautious that the above inference
from Fig. 6 relies on the assumption that p, d and t emissions are characterized by the
same geometrical source size. A more convincing picture is foreseeable if matrices of
analysis can be done with the relative momentum q being perpendicular and parallel
to the sum momentum P of the source [63].

Another feature worth noticing in Fig. 6 is the positive correlation peaks near 45 (60)

MeV/c on the d-d (t-t) correlation function slightly beyond the statistical uncertainty.
This is at variance with the experimental results in earlier literature [68,69,70], where
the positive correlation was not observed possibly because of the low granularity of the
detector. In addition, the CRAB calculation does not reproduce the positive correlation
if a simpliﬁed Woods-Saxon d-d potential is adopted, as shown by the curve in Fig.6
for which the source-size parameter is used as σr = 1.6 fm and the temperature is
obtained from the deuteron energy spectrum. On the other hand, however, the presence
of the positive correlation is qualitatively consistent with the theoretic prediction of
the resonating group (RG) method by taking into account the form factor of deuteron
nucleus [68,71]. Interestingly, It is noticed that the positive correlations have also been
experimentally indicated, although not discussed, at the same positions of the d-d
and t-t CFs in 40Ar+Ag at 17 MeV/u [67]. Comparing to the t-t correlation, which
exhibits an even more pronounced positive peak, the d-d positive correlation is weaker.
If the presence of the positive peak in d-d and t-t CFs is true, it suggests that the
nuclear FSI is possibly playing a role, and that the weaker d-d positive correlation is
consistent with the eﬀect of the formation of α from two deuterons at small distance
in phase space. We checked the possible eﬀect of the cluster recognition algorithms in
the neighboring strips, as well as the α − α correlation function, which did not show
such wide positive correlation except for the known peaks corresponding to the 8Be
and 9Be states [52], the positive correlation could not be excluded. Further studies are
called for to understand the presence of the positive peaks in d-d and t-t CFs.

The observed emission sequence of Z = 1 isotopes, i.e., a N/Z eﬀect on the CFs, may
is at work. Diﬀerent emitting source,
or may not be an evidence that the Esym(ρ)
secondary decay, collective motions [26,50,51], as well as the diﬀerent transport be-
havior of neutrons and protons, all possibly cause the isospin-dependent hierarchy.
More eﬀorts are required to extract convincing isospin eﬀect from the isotope-resolved

CFs. As a starting attempt, we inspect the relaxation of the isospin degree of freedom
(IDOF) with transport model calculations since we are measuring the energetic LCPs
in the current phase space insigniﬁcantly contributed by the evaporation according
to previous moving source analysis[41,55]. In an intuitive picture, neutrons (protons)
experience repulsion (attraction) due to the isovector nuclear potential, thus neutrons
are driven more easily to the gas phase causing isospin fractionation [72]. With a stiﬀer
Esym(ρ), the neutron-proton diﬀerence in terms of emission time constant is larger.

It is of interest to reproduce the IDOF relaxation process with an Improved Quantum
Molecular Dynamics (ImQMD) model incorporating the density dependence of nuclear
symmetry energy Esym(ρ). Instead of pursuing a quantitative comparison with the ex-
perimental emission time constant, we aim at revealing qualitatively the characteristic
of the IDOF relaxation by inspecting the time distribution of the emission of coales-
cence invariant neutrons (CINs) and protons (CIPs). Here CINs (CIPs) refers to the
total neutron (proton) numbers in the light particles with Z < 3. The details of the
ImQMD calculations with IQ3 interaction potential for the same reactions can be found
in [73,74]. Fig. 7 presents the time evolution of the emission rate of CINs and CIPs dur-
ing the dynamic emission stage within t < 600 fm/c. Here t = 100 fm/c corresponds to
the time when the projectile and the target start to contact on surface. To see the eﬀect
of Esym(ρ), two types of density dependence with the slope parameter γi = 0.6 (a) and
1.0 (b) are simulated, representing a soft and a stiﬀ Esym(ρ) respectively. The energy
cut of Ek/A > 10 MeV is applied approximately as in the experiment. The calculation
is done by weighting the impact parameter in the range b = 1 − 5 fm. It is shown that
after the production peak, the emission rate of CINs descends more rapidly than CIPs,
suggesting neutrons experience a faster dynamic emission than protons, either free or
bounded in clusters. We ﬁt the descent with an exponential decay function exp(−t/τ (cid:48)),
where the superscript (cid:48) is written to diﬀerentiate it from the Gaussian extension in

12

’’’’CIP − τ (cid:48)

Eq. (4). For γi = 1.0, the time diﬀerence τ (cid:48)
CIN is larger than that at γi = 0.6,
indicating a faster IDOF relaxation with stiﬀer Esym(ρ) in agreement with the picture
obtained from the angular distribution of the N/Z of LCPs in the same reaction[41].
The qualitative agreement of ImQMD simulation with experiment suggests that the
precise measurement of isospin chronology in the whole phase space, including neutrons
which have not been measured here, raises further scientiﬁc interest of experimental
and theoretical endeavors on the way towards comprehending the eﬀect of Esym(ρ) on
CFs in heavy ion reactions.

4 Summary

In summary, with the Phase-I CSHINE detector appended to RIBLL-1, we have mea-
sured the CFs of like and unlike particle pairs of hydrogen isotopes in 40Ar+197Au at
30 MeV/u. The velocity-gated CFs of p-d, p-t and d-t pairs support the emission se-
quence of τp > τd > τt. For the identical particle pairs, the CF of p-p is reproduced
by K-P equation with τp ≈ 100 fm/c. Besides, the anti-correlation at small q becomes
increasingly pronounced from p-p to d-d and t-t pairs, consistent with the emission
hierarchy that the neutron-rich particles are emitted relatively faster under the as-
sumption that p, d and t emissions are characterized by the same spatial parameter. A
positive peak is observed on both d-d and t-t CFs at variance with earlier experiments
but in qualitative agreement with the theoretic prediction of resonating group method,
requiring further conﬁrmation in future experiments. The quantitative determination
of the isospin chronology can be potentially used to probe the isospin dynamics. Nev-
ertheless, such task is not yet straightforward since various conditions intertwine in the
reaction process, including beam energy, reaction geometry, collective motion and the
convolution of diﬀerent emitting sources etc. In addition, neutrons carrying the ﬁrst-
order isospin eﬀect need to be detected with high accuracy. Therefore further eﬀorts,
both theoretically and experimentally, are called for to better understand the eﬀect of
Esym(ρ) at ρ ≤ ρ0 on intensity interferometry in heavy ion reactions.
