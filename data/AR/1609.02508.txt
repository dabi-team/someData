Draft version November 6, 2018

ABSTRACT
A 3.56-hour white dwarf (WD) - M dwarf (MD) close binary system, AR Scorpii, was recently
reported to show pulsating emission in radio, IR, optical, and UV, with a 1.97-minute period, which
suggests the existence of a WD with a rotation period of 1.95 minutes. We propose a model to
explain the temporal and spectral characteristics of the system. The WD is a nearly perpendicular
rotator, with both open ﬁeld line beams sweeping the MD stellar wind periodically. A bow shock
propagating into the stellar wind accelerates electrons in the wind. Synchrotron radiation of these
shocked electrons can naturally account for the broad-band (from radio to X-rays) spectral energy
distribution of the system.

INTRODUCTION
A white dwarf (WD) - M dwarf (MD) binary, AR Scor-
pii (henceforth AR Sco), was recently reported to emit
pulsed broad-band (radio, IR, optical and UV) emission
(Marsh et al. 2016). The brightness of the system varies
in long time scales with the orbital period of 3.56 hours,
and shows pulsation in short time scales with a period of
1.97 minutes. Interpreting the high pulsating frequency
as the “beat” frequency of the system, the inferred rota-
tion period of the WD is 1.95 minutes. The spectral
energy distribution of the pulsed emission supports a
synchrotron origin for the radiation (Marsh et al. 2016).
These peculiar observational properties make AR Sco a
unique system. Although AR Sco could be in the evolu-
tionary stage of the so-called intermediate polar (Book-
binder & Lamb 1987; Patterson 1994; Oruru & Meintjes
2012), of which accretion is the main power source, the
absence of accretion features in AR Sco demands another
mechanism to explain the observations.

It has been suggested that if the dipole magnetic ﬁeld
of a WD is strong enough, it would behave like a WD
radio pulsar (Zhang & Gil 2005).5 The unique pulsating
properties of AR Sco suggest that such WD pulsars in-
deed exist. Here we propose a WD-MD interaction model
for the system. We show that the interaction between the
WD pulsar open ﬁeld line beams with the stellar wind of
MD naturally accounts for all the observational proper-
ties of the system.

5 The so-called anomalous X-ray pulsars were suggested as mag-
netized WDs (Paczynski 1990; Usov 1993; Malheiro et al. 2012;
Lobato et al. 2016; Mukhopadhyay & Rao 2016), but they are now
widely accepted to be extremely magnetized neutron stars known
as magnetars (Duncan & Thompson 1992; Thompson & Duncan
1996).

White dwarfs are the ﬁnal evolutionary state of stars
whose masses are not large enough to become a neu-
tron star (Heger et al. 2003). A group of WDs have a
surface magnetic ﬁeld ranging from 106 − 109 G (Wick-
ramasinghe & Ferrario 2000). Some of them spin with
periods around one hour, possibly caused by the mass
transfer from a companion star (Ferrario et al. 1997).
These rapidly rotating magnetized WDs would mimic
neutron star pulsars in many ways, e.g., a co-rotating
magnetosphere (Goldreich & Julian 1969), and possible
pair production processes (Zhang & Gil 2005).

The mass and radius of the WD in AR Sco are de-
rived as MWD = 0.8M(cid:12), RWD = 7 × 108 cm, respec-
tively (Marsh et al. 2016). With the measured period
P = 1.95 min and period derivative ˙P = 3.9×10−13s s−1,
the spin down luminosity of the WD pulsar in AR Sco
˙Erot = −4π2I ˙P P −3 (cid:39) 3.0 × 1033erg s−1. where

WD is the moment of inertia of the WD. The
mean luminosity of AR Sco is (cid:39) 1.7 × 1033erg s−1 includ-
ing the emission from the MD, and is (cid:39) 1.6 × 1031erg s−1
for the non-thermal emission only. Therefore, the spin-
down power of the WD can comfortably power the non-
thermal radiation of AR Sco.

Assuming a magnetic dipole for the WD and consid-
ering a wind outﬂow from the magnetosphere, the mag-
netic spin down power can be written as (e.g. Shapiro
& Teukolsky 1983; Xu & Qiao 2001; Contopoulos &

The light cylinder radius is Rlc = cP/2π = 5.6 ×

between the WD and the MD, d ∼ 7.6 × 1010cm. This
suggests that the MD sits inside the magnetosphere of
the WD, and signiﬁcant interaction between the WD
wind and MD is expected. The polar cap opening an-

which can accelerate electrons to a Lorentz factor of γe =

and me is the electron mass. Pair production through γ−
B and γ − γ mechanisms is possible, so that the WD can
act as an active pulsar (Zhang & Gil 2005; Kashiyama et
al. 2011).

3. GEOMETRY
Before performing calculations on the radiation prop-
erties, we ﬁrst infer the geometry of AR Sco by analyzing
the temporal characteristics of the pulses. Unlike radio
pulsars which typically show a small duty cycle < 10%,
AR Sco shows a large duty cycle of about 50% in the
lightcurves in broad band. The emission likely comes
from the MD rather than the WD itself (Marsh et al.
2016). More interestingly, there are two peaks in each
period, and each peak has exactly the same period. A
natural explanation is that the WD is a nearly perpen-
dicular rotator (the angle between the spin and magnetic
axes is close to α ∼ 90◦)6 with both open ﬁeld line beams
sweeping the MD in each rotation period. The orbital
brightness modulation implies that the inclination of the
orbital plane to the line-of-sight is small. A deviation of
the line-of-sight from the orbital plane would naturally
produce the uneven brightness of the two peaks in each

6 In our calculations below, we adopt α ∼ 90◦ to simplify the
problem.
In more realistic cases, one needs to consider a three-
dimensional (3D) geometry. In view that the MD is very close to
the WD so that it opens up a large solid angle to the WD, there
is a wide range of α values (e.g. α > 45◦) that can make the two
WD beams sweep the MD wind, and hence, to interpret the data.
Strictly speaking, α should not be too close to 90◦, since this would
cause the eclipse of the shocked wind (see below) at certain orbital
phases if the line-of-sight is also in the orbital plane. A detailed
geometry parameter search is beyond the scope of this paper.

spin cycle. All these clues lead to a special geometric
conﬁguration as shown in Figure 1. The spin axis of the
WD points into the plane of the page, while the line-of-
sight and the orbital plane are roughly on the page plane
for the speciﬁc conﬁguration in Fig. 1.

The ratio between the durations of the active pulse and
the quiescent time is ∼ 1:1 (duty cycle ∼ 50%). This
suggests that the opening angle of the entire radiation
site seen from the WD should be ∼ 90◦. Since the MD
only opens a 2RMD/d ∼ 38◦ angle from the WD, the
actual location of the emission site should be at a larger
radius from the MD center. The interaction between
the particle beam streaming out from the open ﬁeld line
regions and the MD wind would lead to the formation
of a bow shock, where the electrons can be accelerated
to give radiation. In Fig. 1, when the open ﬁeld lines
of the WD are approaching the atmosphere of the MD,
there exists a position at which the ram pressure of the
stellar wind balances the magnetic pressure. We note
this position as point “A” (its position will be calculated
in Section 4.2) and assume that radiation rises from this
point. In the realistic 3D case, this position should be a
part of a ring-like region. According to the duty cycle of
the pulsation, the angle from the WD between point A
and the MD center should be θA ∼ 90◦/2 = 45◦.

4. RADIATION
4.1. Synchrotron Radiation
An outﬂow of relativistic particles from the open ﬁeld
line regions of the WD would impact the MD wind and
drive a bow shock into it. Since the magnetization of
the WD wind is not known, there may or may not be a
reverse shock. In any case, since the accelerated particles
are still within the magnetosphere of the WD, they would
give rise to synchrotron radiation in the magnetic ﬁeld
of the magnetosphere.

The open ﬁeld lines of the WD would be extruded by
the ram pressure of the stellar wind during the period
when they sweep the MD wind. When the polar cap
faces the center of the MD, the eﬀective opening angle
of the open ﬁeld lines reaches the maximum value (Fig.
1), and the luminosity also reaches the peak value. We
deﬁne the head position of the bow shock at this epoch
as point “B”. Since the magnetic pressure at B is larger
than that at A, the magnetic pressure would push point
B to be near the surface of the MD. Its distance to the
center of the WD is x ∼ d − RMD (cid:39) 5.1 × 1010 cm
(RMD = 2.5 × 1010 cm is the radius of the MD) and the
corresponding magnetic ﬁeld is BB = Bp (x/RWD)−3 (cid:39)
1860 G. Since the synchrotron emission spectral energy
distribution (SED) we model is an average one across
diﬀerent phases, we use an average magnetic ﬁeld ¯B =
(BA + BB)/2 (cid:39) 1200 G (BA is the magnetic ﬁeld at A
and is obtained according to its position, see Section 4.2)
in our calculations.

For a relativistic electron of Lorentz factor γe, its ra-

diation power is (Rybicki & Lightman 1979)

It is reasonable to assume that the relativistic electrons

Inspecting
the SED (Marsh et al. 2016, Fig. 2), we ﬁnd νm (cid:39)
5 × 1012 Hz, which gives γm = 45. The cooling Lorentz
factor γc can be estimated by equating tcool(γc) with the
mean dynamical time of the shock tdyn (cid:39) 45◦/2
360◦ P , where
45◦ is the angle for the WD beam to sweep through before
reaching the peak, and the half value reﬂects the mean
angle, which deﬁnes the mean dynamical time scale. We
then obtain γc = 73 (P/1.95 min)−1. The Lamor radius
of a relativistic electron is RL = γemec2/qe ¯B, and its
acceleration time scale can be calculated as tacc (cid:39) RL/c.
Equating tacc(γmax) with tcool(γmax), one can obtain the
maximum Lorentz factor of the shocked electrons as
γmax = (cid:0)6πqe/σT ¯B(cid:1)1/2
= 3.4 × 106. The correspond-
ing maximum Lamor radius is RL,max = 4.8 × 106 cm.

Assuming that the width of the emission shell is ηRMD,
the shell volume V is 2π(1 − cos(θB))ηR3
MD, where θB is
the half opening angle of the shell seen from the MD, and
θB (cid:39) 90◦ − arcsin(RMD/d) = 71◦ (Fig. 1). The value of
η may be inferred from the Lamor radius of the most
energetic electron, i.e., η (cid:39) 2RL,max/RMD = 4 × 10−4.
Since νm < νc, the synchrotron emission is in the slow
cooling regime, and the peak ﬂux density is at νm, which
reads

where DL = 116 pc is the distance of AR Sco to the

(Marsh et al. 2016). We therefore obtain

(10)

This gives an estimate on the parameter ne of the emis-
sion region. The source of the emitting electrons remains
not speciﬁed so far, which we will constrain next.

4.2. Source of Electrons
The Goldreich & Julian (1969) charge number density

of the WD pulsar at position B is estimated as

nGJ =

Ω · BB
2πqec

= 1.1 cm−3.

(11)

This is signiﬁcantly lower than the required ne in Eq.(10).
The primary electrons ejected from the polar cap may

produce secondary electron-positron pairs through some
pair production process (e.g. Zhang & Harding 2000).
However, the pair multiplicity χ = n±/nGJ is at most
106 even for young radio pulsars (e.g. Arons 2009). This
is not enough to account for Eq.(10), which demands
χ ∼ 108. We therefore conclude that the synchrotron
emitting electrons are not from the WD wind.

We now consider the possibility that the emitting elec-
trons come from the stellar wind of the MD. Assuming
that the wind velocity v is two times of the escape ve-
locity from the MD (stellar wind velocities are generally
not much greater than the surface escape velocity, e.g.,
Wood 2004), i.e.,

v = 2vesc = 2

10−11(ζ/0.2)−1M(cid:12)/yr, where ζ denotes the fraction of
electrons that are accelerated and ne has been taken as
3.5 × 108 cm−3 as required in Eq. (10). This value is
within the range of mass-loss rate of MDs in the lit-
erature, 10−15 − 10−10M(cid:12)/yr (e.g. Mullan et al. 1992;
Wood et al. 2001; Vidotto et al. 2014). It indicates that
the wind from the MD could be a reasonable source for
electrons.

The position of the balance point A (see Fig. 1 and
Section 3), can be found using the balance between the
ram pressure of the wind and the magnetic pressure. We
deﬁne the distance between A and the MD center as
rA. The distance between A and the WD center may
be roughly estimated as d. The relative velocity between
the wind and the magnetic ﬁeld lines is thus vrel = 2π
P d.

Another way to derive rA is from the geometric relation
in Fig. 1. For the isosceles triangle deﬁned by point A
and the centers of the two stars, one has sin θA/rA =
sin(90◦ − θA/2)/d, which gives rA = 5.8 × 1010 cm for
θA ∼ 45◦. One can see that the values of rA are consis-
tent with each other using two methods, suggesting that
the emitting electrons are indeed from the MD wind.

4.3. The Spectrum
Using the electron distribution in Equation (7), one
can calculate the synchrotron spectrum. The spectrum

4

Geng et al.

is characterized by a broken power law separated by three
frequencies, the self-absorption frequency νa, the injec-
tion frequency νm, and the cooling frequency νc (Sari et
al. 1998). The characteristic frequencies νm and νc are
derived from γm and γc, respectively. The spectrum in
the spectral regime νm < ν < νc has νFν ∝ ν−(p−3)/2.
According to the observed SED of AR Sco (Marsh et al.
2016), the source was also detected in the X-ray band by
Swift X-Ray Telescope (even though not pulsed). The
X-ray data constrains the value of p to be around 2.4.
The self-absorption coeﬃcient at frequency ν can be cal-
culated as (e.g., Rybicki & Lightman 1979; Wu et al.

One gets νa (cid:39) 2.4 × 10−3 νm for AR Sco. Figure 2 dis-
plays the comparison between our analytical model SED
and the observed SED (Marsh et al. 2016). One can see
that the model can well interpret the data. One inter-
esting feature is that the observed ﬂux at the thermal
peak exceeds the model spectrum of the MD thermal
emission. However, adding the contribution of the non-
thermal synchrotron component (which extends all the
way to the X-ray band), the total model ﬂux matches
the observations very well.

5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We have shown that the peculiar observations of the
pulsating AR Sco system can be understood with the
framework of interaction between the WD pulsar’s open

ﬁeld line beams and the wind of the MD. The observa-
tional data demand a nearly perpendicular rotator for
the WD pulsar, and a near edge-on orbital conﬁguration
for the observer on Earth. In order to interpret the ob-
served SED, the required electron number density is too
high for a WD wind. Rather electrons accelerated by
a bow shock into the MD wind can produce the right
amount of electrons to interpret both the shape and the
normalization of the SED.

In our model, although the magnetic ﬁeld lines of the
WD are likely ordered, an observer sees a hemisphere
where magnetic ﬁeld lines have diﬀerent directions so
that on average the directional information cancels out
(e.g.
in Fig. 2, the ﬁeld lines above and below point
B have opposite orientations). One would therefore do
not expect signiﬁcant circular polarization (Matsumiya
& Ioka 2003), which is consistent with the observations
(Marsh et al. 2016).

Our model suggests that rapidly rotating, highly mag-
netized WDs can indeed behave like radio pulsars, as has
been speculated in the past (Zhang & Gil 2005). The rar-
ity of these WD pulsars (Kepler et al. 2013) may be due
to the conditions to produce an active magnetosphere via
pair production are much more stringent for WDs than
NSs. The peculiarity of AR Sco lies in its extremely short
period and its close proximity with its MD companion.
According to our modeling, the observed emission is from
the shocked MD wind rather than from the WD pulsar
itself. However, if some WDs indeed behave as pulsars,
one would expect to directly detect emission from WD
pulsars in the future. GCRT J1745-3009 might be an-
other, less energetic, transient WD pulsar (Zhang & Gil
2005) at a distance beyond 1 kpc from the earth (Kaplan
et al. 2008).

Fig. 1.— Schematic pictures of the WD/MD binary in AR Sco. The upper panel shows the episode that the emission begins to rise
when the open ﬁeld lines approach the balance point A (see Section 3). The lower panel shows the episode when the emission reaches the
peak emissivity. Note that the rotation axis of the WD points into the the page plane, while the orbital plane and the line-of-sight are all
roughly within the page plane.

Fig. 2.— The observed SED of AR Sco compared with our analytical model results. The red and black solid line represent the blackbody
spectrum from the MD (temperature of 3100 K) and the WD (temperature of 9750 K), respectively. The blue solid line is the analytical
model synchrotron spectrum. The observational data points (without error bars) are obtained from Figure 4 of Marsh et al. (2016).
