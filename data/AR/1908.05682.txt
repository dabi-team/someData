ABSTRACT
This manuscript describes the public release of the Hubble Legacy Fields (HLF) project photomet-
ric catalog for the extended GOODS-South region from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archival
program AR-13252. The analysis is based on the version 2.0 HLF data release that now includes all
ultraviolet (UV) imaging, combining three major UV surveys. The HLF data combines over a decade
worth of 7475 exposures taken in 2635 orbits totaling 6.3 Msec with the HST Advanced Camera for
Surveys Wide Field Channel (ACS/WFC) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) UVIS/IR Channels
in the greater GOODS-S extragalactic ﬁeld, covering all major observational eﬀorts (e.g., GOODS,
GEMS, CANDELS, ERS, UVUDF and many other programs; see Illingworth et al 2019, in prep). The
HLF GOODS-S catalogs include photometry in 13 bandpasses from the UV (WFC3/UVIS F225W,
F275W and F336W ﬁlters), optical (ACS/WFC F435W, F606W, F775W, F814W and F850LP ﬁlters),
to near-infrared (WFC3/IR F098M, F105W, F125W, F140W and F160W ﬁlters). Such a data set
makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wave-
length range from high resolution mosaics that are largely contiguous. Here, we describe a photometric
analysis of 186,474 objects in the HST imaging at wavelengths 0.2–1.6µm. We detect objects from an
ultra-deep image combining the PSF-homogenized and noise-equalized F850LP, F125W, F140W and
F160W images, including Gaia astrometric corrections. SEDs were determined by carefully taking
the eﬀects of the point-spread function in each observation into account. All of the data presented
herein are available through the HLF website (https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hlf/).

1. INTRODUCTION
Our current understanding of the formation and evo-
lution of galaxies with cosmic time is driven by large,
statistical samples that span a broad range of multi-
wavelength observations. The deepest and highest reso-
lution observations exploring the peak epoch of star for-
mation in our universe are those from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST; e.g., Giavalisco et al. 2004; Scoville

2007; Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011; Mom-
cheva et al. 2016). When combining HST with the deep-
est ground-based observations and Spitzer Space Tele-
scope, surveys enable the measurement of fundamental
galaxy properties for tens of thousands of extragalactic
sources. HST alone has pushed galaxy studies into un-
charted territory (e.g., McLeod et al. 2015; Oesch et al.
2016).

The scientiﬁc returns from extragalactic legacy surveys
are maximized when data sets are combined in a homo-
geneous way. To this end, we undertake the construction
of a photometric catalog based solely on all high reso-
lution HST imaging taken in the greater GOODS-S ex-
tragalactic ﬁeld to date. While the future inclusion of
Spitzer /IRAC and ground-based ancillary data will con-
tinue to improved the measured photometric redshifts
and stellar population parameters, this work serves as a
necessary albeit incremental step towards a comprehen-
sive ﬁnal catalog of the GOODS-S extragalactic legacy
ﬁeld. The extended GOODS-S/CDF-S region has the
largest ensemble of HST imaging data of any area of
the sky. The equivalent of approximately 75% of an
HST cycle has now been committed to imaging this area
through more than 30 diﬀerent programs. In total, there
is 6.3 Msec of HST on-target time through 7475 ex-
posures taken over 2635 orbits of ACS, WFC3/IR and
WFC3/UVIS imaging. A summary of all programs is
found in Table 1.

The catalog is based on the version 2.0 (v2.0) release
of the Hubble Legacy Field GOODS-S (HLF-GOODS-S).

included in the photometric catalog. The v2.0 version
of HLF-GOODS-S updates the v1.5 version with the in-
clusion of all of the available UV imaging data. The
three UV surveys added constitute a substantial body
of data, totaling 213 orbits of HST WFC3/UVIS imag-
ing, or about 0.5 Msec of observations: the Early Release
Science (ERS) observations (Windhorst et al. 2011), the
UltraViolet Ultra-Deep Field (UVUDF) dataset (Teplitz
et al. 2013; Rafelski et al. 2015), the Hubble Deep Ul-
traViolet (HDUV) legacy dataset (Oesch et al. 2018), as
well as additional F336W imaging data (Vanzella et al.
2016). A summary of these UV programs and the details
of all other datasets from v1.5 can be found in Table 1.
The orbit values listed are computed from the total ex-
posure time in each program/ﬁlter, where 1 orbit equals
2400s of exposure time. The UV datasets were updated
and astrometrically-matched to the v1.5 release of the
HLF-GOODS-S. The ERS dataset of Windhorst et al.
(2011) required a full processing as high level science
products are not available on the Mulkulsi Archive for
Space Telescopes. The steps that were taken to assemble
the HST UV, optical and near-IR data, including details
of the data reduction and astrometric analysis, can be
found in Illingworth et al. (2016, 2019, in prep). Here,
we describe the details of the source detection, PSF ho-
mogenization, and catalog construction. We provide the
homogenized set of images that are used in this paper to
the community, in addition to the photometric catalog.
The structure of this manuscript is as follows. In Sec-
tion 2.2 and 2.3, we describe the additional background
subtraction and the source detection, respectively. Sec-
tion 2.3 details the PSF matching of the diﬀerent reso-
lution images, and Section 2.4 the general layout of the
photometric catalogs themselves. We present basic in-
ternal and external diagnostic plots to verify quality and
consistency in Section 3. Section 4 contains a general
overview of the public release of the HLF GOODS-S pho-
tometric catalog.

In this manuscript, all magnitudes are in the AB sys-
tem and we assume a ΛCDM cosmology with ΩM = 0.3,
ΩΛ = 0.7, and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1.

2. PHOTOMETRY
We construct the HLF photometric catalog as de-
tailed below, closely following the techniques discussed
in depth in Skelton et al. (2014) and Shipley et al.

(2018).
In summary, we use a deep noise-equalized
combination of the four HST bands (F850LP, F125W,
F140W, F160W) for detection.
12 HST bandpasses
(F225W, F275W, F336W, F435W, F606W, F775W,
F814W, F850LP, F098M, F105W, F125W, and F140W)
are each convolved to the F160W point-spread function
(PSF) in order to measure consistent colors across all
wavebands. For this entire analysis, we use the v2.0
release 60 mas pixel scale mosaics. Aperture photom-
etry was performed in dual-image mode using Source
Extractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) on the background-
subtracted, homogenized images using a small aperture
of diameter of 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48) that maximizes the signal-to-noise of
the resulting aperture photometry.

2.1. Background Subtraction
With the v2.0 mosaics for the optical and near-infrared
ﬁlters (F435W–F160W) and the ultraviolet (F225W–
F336W), we ﬁrst do an additional sky subtraction to re-
move any excess light previously missed during the initial
routine sky subtraction performed during the data re-
duction. The sky subtraction is performed using Source
Extractor (SExtractor; Bertin & Arnouts 1996), using
a Gaussian interpolation of the background with an
adopted mesh size of 64 pixels and a 7 pixel median ﬁlter
size. The result of this sky subtraction is on the order of
a few hundredths of a percent per pixel, a minimal cor-
rection but necessary to improve the overall homogeneity
of the background.

2.2. Source Detection
We create a detection image that is a noise-equalized
version of the mosaics combining one ACS (F850LP)
with three WFC3 bands (F125W, F140W, F160W) by
multiplying the PSF-matched science images (see details
in Section 2.3) by the square root of the inverse vari-
ance map. These four noise-equalized images are then
coadded to form an ultra-deep detection image. Such a
methodology has been adopted in several earlier surveys:
e.g., NMBS (Whitaker et al. 2011), 3D-HST (Skelton
et al. 2014), and HFF-DeepSpace (Shipley et al. 2018).
The decision to include F850LP stems from the wide ﬁeld
coverage in this ﬁlter that extends to signiﬁcantly larger
area than the nominal WFC3 footprint. Our methodol-
ogy adopts an extremely deep detection image while also
explicitly taking into account variations in the weight

across the mosaics. This variation in weight is a natural
consequence of combining many diﬀerent observing pro-
grams with unique science goals into single mosaics. We
use a detection and analysis threshold of 1.8σ and 1.4σ,
respectively, and require a minimum area of 14 pixels for
detection. The deblending threshold is set to 32, with a
minimum contrast parameter of 0.0001. A Gaussian ﬁlter
of 7 pixels is used to smooth the images before detection.
The detection parameters were optimized such that the
settings are a compromise between deblending neighbor-
ing objects while minimizing dividing larger objects into
multiple components. Moreover, visual inspection con-
ﬁrms that the input SExtractor parameters ﬁnd all faint
objects in the ultra-deep detection images, while limiting
the number of spurious detections.

The resulting objects detected are not cleaned for spu-
rious detections within SExtractor itself, as this may
cause subtle problems with the segmentation maps. In-
stead, we clean the photometry in post-processing. Any
object residing in a region with a weight less than 1%
of the 95th percentile weight is identiﬁed as problematic
and the photometry of the respective band is ﬁxed to a
value of -99. This represents 30% of the total catalog in
the F160W and F850LP ﬁlters.

2.3. Point Spread Function Homogenization
In order to measure accurate colors, we need to PSF-
match the HST ACS and WFC3 images to the ﬁlter with
the broadest FWHM (the F160W ﬁlter in this dataset)
prior to performing aperture photometry. To do so, em-
pirical PSFs are created for each HST image by stack-
ing isolated unsaturated stars selected from across the
mosaic. An initial sample of stars are identiﬁed on the
basis of the ratio of their ﬂuxes within a large 3(cid:48)(cid:48) diam-
eter aperture relative to a small 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48) diameter aperture.
Bright, unsaturated stars can be cleanly identiﬁed from
this ratio (see Figure 2). The number of stars identiﬁed
ranges from a minimum of 29 in F098M to a maximum
of 353 in F606W, with a more typical value of 100–200
stars. We extract 5(cid:48)(cid:48)×5(cid:48)(cid:48) regions around each star, re-
centering and masking nearby pixels that are either as-
sociated with nearby objects according to the segmen-
tation map, or 5σ above the local noise. All stars that
either require >1.5 pixel shifts to recenter or fail alto-
gether are additionally rejected at this stage. From this
parent sample, we perform a visual inspection to remove
any remaining problematic stars. A few examples of re-
moved sources include cases where the central pixels were
masked incorrectly as cosmic rays, the objects fell on the
edge of the detector, or the object was severely contami-

Fig. 2.— Point sources have a ratio of ﬂux within a larger 3(cid:48)(cid:48) diameter circular aperture relative to a small 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48) diameter aperture close
to unity. We can therefore cleanly identify bright, unsaturated stars (red) to generate empirical PSFs in each ﬁlter on the basis of this
ratio.

nated by nearby bright objects. Most stars automatically
identiﬁed in the UVIS F225W–F336W ﬁlters fell on the
edges of the detector and therefore failed the earlier re-
centering algorithm. For example, after this step, the
total number of useable stars reduced from 100s to 8–
21 in F225W-F336W. The median local background is
measured on the ﬁnal stacked image for pixels located
at a radius of 4–5(cid:48)(cid:48). Though often negligible, we sub-
tract this background correction. We do not attempt to
take into account variations with chip position, as the
mosaics comprise multiple pointings with diﬀerent orien-
tations and overlap. As noted by Skelton et al. (2014),
we expect such diﬀerences to be small.

Figure 3 shows the empirical PSFs and weight maps

generated from the procedure outlined herein based on
the v2.0 HLF project mosaics. Note that there may be
some residual false clipping of the central pixels of the
ACS images due to the cosmic ray rejection adopted dur-
ing the data reduction. Evidence for this can be seen in
the depression in the centers of the stacked ACS weight
maps for bright stars. One reason this happens in the
ACS images is that the dataset itself has been taken over
an approximately 12 year timespan. Over this epoch,
the positions of some stars have changed. The central
pixels will therefore get clipped, as they are no longer
aligned due to this proper motion. The top row in Fig-
ure 3 emphasizes the core of the PSF where most of the
power resides, whereas the contrast in middle and bot-

tom rows highlights the ﬁrst Airy ring (0.5%) and the
diﬀraction spikes (0.1%), respectively. A single orienta-
tion would contain four diﬀraction spikes resulting from
the secondary mirror assembly. We see in some cases
here a much larger number of diﬀraction spikes (espe-
cially for WFC3) due to the broad range of orientations
that comprise the mosaiced data. The trade oﬀ of the ag-
gressive deblending adopted on the ultra-deep detection
image is that the diﬀraction spikes and ﬁrst Airy ring
around bright stars will often be identiﬁed as a separate
object from the star itself. This can be seen in the weight
maps, with the masked regions outlining these PSF fea-
tures. Note however that these are very faint features
and the PSF remains robust given the large number of
stars contributing to the stack in the NIR; the point of
the PSF homogenization is to match the light proﬁles
across all of the ﬁlters, which we will show in the next
section is good to the <0.5% level at all radii.

Figure 4 shows the curve of growth, deﬁned as the
fraction of light enclosed as a function of aperture size,
for each of the PSFs, normalized at 2(cid:48)(cid:48). The top panel
of Figure 4 shows the growth curves from the empirical
PSFs presented in Figure 3, whereas the bottom panel
shows the results after convolving each PSF to match
F160W. We derive the convolution kernel by ﬁtting a
series of Gaussian-weighted Hermite polynomials to the
Fourier transform of the empirical PSFs (Figure 5). This
methodology yields PSFs with almost indistinguishable
growth curves on the scales of interest, agreeing to <0.5%
at all radii.

Finally, we present a comparison between the encircled
energy as a function of aperture provided in the WFC3
handbook relative to our derived F160W empirical PSF
in Figure 6. The marginal deviations towards the center
of the PSF are not signiﬁcant, with the curves showing
excellent agreement.

2.4. Detection Limits
It is challenging to deﬁne completeness limits given
our detection methodology and the nature of the HLF
dataset, combining a wide range of surveys with dra-
matically varying depths and coverage between ﬁlters.
Moreover, deﬁning a single-band magnitude limit is also

of Gaussian-weighted Hermite polynomials to match each empirical
PSF to the broadest FWHM F160W ﬁlter.

dashed line shows the encircled energy as a function of aperture
size, also normalized to 2(cid:48)(cid:48), from the WFC3 handbook. The em-
pirical growth curves (black points) agree well with the theoretical
expectation.

not entirely meaningful, as it is well known that the de-
tection and completeness limits are a function of galaxy
color (e.g., van der Wel et al. 2012). In order to enable
users of the HLF GOODS-S dataset to determine the
completeness limit of a given sample, we create an ef-
fective wavelength map that is equivalent to tracing the
wavelength contributing the deepest data at a given lo-
cation. This eﬀective wavelength map can then be used
to determine the magnitude limit for any given object
in the mosaic, given the location and z-H color, as we
describe next.

To create the eﬀective wavelength map for our source
detection, we take the convolved weight maps for each
of the four ﬁlters that combine to make our noise-
equalized detection image: zF850LP, JF125W, JHF140W,
and HF160W. As the released mosaics maintain the orig-
inal zeropoints, we ﬁrst correct all weight maps to a com-
mon zeropoint of 25 ABmag. The eﬀective wavelength

6

Whitaker et al.

map is then calculated as follows,

λe =

(cid:115) (cid:80) (wX λe,X )2
(cid:80) w2
X

(1)

where X corresponds to the four ﬁlters listed above, w is
the weight and λe is the pivot wavelength for each ﬁlter.
Figure 7 shows the HLF GOODS-S eﬀective wavelength
map. The eﬀective wavelength is largely representative
of ∼1.2µm across the central ﬁeld of view, with more
extended contiguous coverage at 0.9µm. We create an
eﬀective depth map in a similar manner as above, adding
the four weight maps in quadrature, inverting, and taking
the square root. Given the eﬀective wavelenth and depth
maps, one can simply interpolate the eﬀective wavelength
at a given location between 0.92µm (zF850LP) and 1.54
µm (HF160W), using that fraction multiplied by the z-H
color to correct the eﬀective depth in the detection image
to the equivalent depth in the HF160W mosaic. In other
words, one can approximate the eﬀective HF160W depth
for any source from its z-H color as:

σlim,H = σlim,λe + (z − H)

(cid:18) λe − 1.54
1.54 − 0.92

(cid:19)

.

(2)

For example, let us consider a red object with a z-H
color of 1.0 in the mosaic outskirts where the eﬀective
wavelength of the detection map is 0.9µm.
If the ef-
fective depth is 26 ABmag, the depth in HF160W would
be 1 magnitude shallower at 25 ABmag for this source,
given the red color but deeper z-band mosaic at this lo-
cation. On the other hand, a blue object with a z-H
color of -1.0 in the same region would instead have an
eﬀective HF160W depth that is 1 magnitude deeper at 27
ABmag. The eﬀective wavelength and depth maps are
both available to users within the larger HLF GOODS-S
photometric catalog public release.

2.5. Photometric Catalogs
2.5.1. Aperture Photometry
Our aperture photometry methodology closely follows
that of Skelton et al. (2014). We therefore brieﬂy sum-
marize the main steps followed here and note any diﬀer-
ent assumptions we have adopted, but defer the reader
to Section 3.4 of Skelton et al. (2014) for additional de-
tails. SExtractor is run in dual-image mode, where the
ultra-deep noise-equalized input image is used for detec-
tion (see Section 2.2) and the PSF-matched HST im-
age and corresponding convolved weight map are used
for the aperture photometry. No further background
subtraction is needed at this stage. We perform pho-
tometry within a 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48) diameter circular aperture in all
the HST bands. This relatively small aperture opti-
mizes the photometry signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for
point sources (and small higher redshift galaxies), as
discussed in Whitaker et al. (2011) and later adapted
for HST resolution data in Skelton et al. (2014). This
aperture diameter was identiﬁed by taking a ratio of
the ﬂux enclosed from the growth curve analysis rela-
tive to the analogous error analysis (“empty apertures”,
as described in Section 2.5.3) as a function of aperture
diameter. The SNR peaks around 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48) for HST qual-
ity data, thus optimizing the color photometry. The

ranging from the zF850LP at 0.9µm (black) to HF160W at 1.5µm
(yellow/white). The ﬁlter with the deepest data (largest weights)
will dominate the eﬀective wavelength map, which varies across the
ﬁeld of view due to the heterogeneous nature of the HLF GOODS-S
combined dataset.

adopted aperture corresponds to a physical radius of 2.6-
3.0 kpc at z(cid:38)1, which is smaller than the eﬀective radius
for the majority of galaxies at these redshifts (van der
Wel et al. 2014). For the most massive galaxies, espe-
cially star-forming, the eﬀective radii will extend beyond
the aperture. In these cases (and at z(cid:46)1), we underre-
solve galaxies and eﬀectively measure central colors only.
The decision to adopt a relatively small aperture will
therefore not be optimal for certain parameter spaces.
Speciﬁc examples include the majority of star-forming
galaxies and intermediate/massive (log(M(cid:63)/M(cid:12))>10.5)
quiescent galaxies at z<1, intermediate to massive star-
forming galaxies (log(M(cid:63)/M(cid:12))>10) and massive quies-
cent galaxies (log(M(cid:63)/M(cid:12))>11) at 1<z<2, and interme-
diate/massive star-forming galaxies (log(M(cid:63)/M(cid:12))>10.5)
at z∼2-3. In these cases, the average eﬀective radii are
similar to or larger than the adopted aperture radius due
to their more extended light proﬁles. It is worth noting
that the ﬁeld has not yet converged on the role of color
gradients at high redshift. Our methodology assumes a
ﬂat gradient by design, which may indeed be a fair as-
sumption at z>2: Suess et al. (2019) recently showed
that color gradients of star-forming and quiescent galax-
ies are generally ﬂat at z>2, but color gradients may
become more prominent as redshift decreases. In the pa-
rameter spaces outlined above, the spectral energy dis-
tribution (SED) will be dominated by the central light of
the galaxy and may not be representative of the global
stellar population properties.

The standard astrometry matches the CANDELS
and 3D-HST public releases, but we provide an ad-
ditional column that corrects for known oﬀsets in as-
trometry. These astrometric diﬀerences were ﬁrst de-
tected with ALMA data, with oﬀsets in the HUDF

of δra(deg)=(+0.094±0.042)/3600 and δdec(deg)=(-
0.262±0.050)/3600 (see Dunlop et al. 2017; Franco et al.
2018). We adopt an identical approach to Franco
et al. (2018), but instead compare positions in the
3D-HST photometric catalogs (which use the same as-
trometry as the HLF) to the Gaia DR2 catalogs (Gaia
Collaboration et al. 2016, 2018). We calculate oﬀ-
sets of δra(deg)=(+0.011±0.08)/3600 and δdec(deg)=(-
0.26±0.10)/3600, with the equations used to deﬁne these
corrections listed in Table 2. These oﬀsets are in good
agreement with Franco et al. (2018).

The reference band is chosen to be F160W where there
is coverage (52% objects) and F850LP otherwise. This
decision stems from the wider area coverage of F850LP.
We return to this issue when deﬁning columns within
the photometric catalog, as there is a signiﬁcant fraction
of the mosaic with only F850LP coverage. The total
ﬂux in the reference band is determined by correcting
the SExtractor AUTO ﬂux for the amount of light that
falls outside of the AUTO aperture. Assuming a point
source, this correction can be calculated directly from
the growth curves described in Section 2.3. The adopted
radius of the AUTO ﬂux corresponds to the Kron ra-
dius(Kron 1980), which encloses rough 90–95% of the
total light within a ﬂexible elliptical aperture. Our aper-
ture correction to total ﬂux is therefore the inverse of
the fraction of light enclosed within a circular aperture
encompassing the same area as the Kron aperture (i.e.,
the circularized Kron radius). We determine this circu-
larized Kron radius directly from the empirical growth
curve for F160W and use the same aperture correction
from the reference band to scale all ﬁlters. We apply an
additional small correction (<0.04 mag) to the photom-
etry to account for Galactic extinction in each ﬁlter. We
interpolate from values given by the NASA Extragalac-
tic Database extinction law calculator, following Skelton
et al. (2014) (see Figure 8). All ﬂuxes within the cata-
log are given as total, with an AB magnitude zero point
equal to 25. We also provide the aperture ﬂux in the
F160W and F850LP reference bands to allow the user to
convert the total ﬂuxes back to consistent color measure-
ments for any band.

Unlike in Skelton et al. (2014), we do not calculate an
additional photometric correction to account for any zero
point or template mismatch uncertainties. The GOODS-
S HLF photometric catalog is strictly comprised of HST
ﬁlters that typically have minimal zero point oﬀsets cal-
culated. For the case of the 3D-HST GOODS-S photo-
metric catalog, Skelton et al. (2014) calculate zero point
oﬀsets ranging from 0.00 to 0.02 mag for all ﬁlters but
F435W (-0.09 mag). We will return to this point in Sec-
tion 3.2.

2.5.2. Catalog Format
The format of the photometric catalog follows that of
the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (Whitaker et al.
2011) and the 3D-HST Survey (Skelton et al. 2014),
among others. The total ﬂux and corresponding 1σ error
for each object is tabulated. The list of column headers
and their respective descriptions is located in Table 2.
We brieﬂy summarize a few notable columns below.

The weight column for each band quantiﬁes the rel-
ative weight for each object compared to the maximum
weight for that ﬁlter. In practice, the weight is calculated

NASA Extragalactic Database at the coordinates of the GOODS-S
extragalactic ﬁeld (dotted line; Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011). Cor-
rections for Galactic extinction are applied to the HLF GOODS-S
photometric catalog by interpolation, where the stars represent the
corrections for each HST ﬁlter.

as the ratio of the weight at each objects position relative
to the 95th percentile of the weight map smoothed using
a 3 pixel block average. We choose to use the 95th per-
centile rather than the absolute maximum of the weight
map to avoid being aﬀected by extreme values, which is
especially important with smaller area ultra deep cover-
age. For those objects with a weight greater than the
95th percentile, we ﬁx the value to unity in the weight
column.

The star flag column is useful to robustly identify
objects that are classiﬁed as foreground stars within
our own Milky Way galaxy. These point sources are
identiﬁed on the basis of comparing their SExtractor
flux radius as a function of HF160W (zF850LP) magni-
tude (Top panels of Figure 9). Stars are given a value of 1
in the star flag if their ﬂux radius falls below the selec-
tion line (deﬁned in Skelton et al. 2014) and HF160W<25
mag column. For all fainter objects with HF160W>25
mag, we cannot robustly separate unresolved galaxies
from point sources. These objects have star flag val-
ues of 2, and we encourage the user to proceed with cau-
tion. While we use the ratio in a large to small aper-
ture as a function of magnitude to identify stars in the
PSF-matching section, we ultimately do not adopt this
method for deﬁning the star ﬂag as the magnitude limit
at which ambiguity of the tight stellar locus sets in is
roughly two magnitudes brighter.

The detection flag column has a value of unity
where the F850LP mosaic is adopted as the reference
band. In these cases, there is no F160W coverage avail-
able. Most often, the broader wavelength coverage in this
more extended area is sparse. In the case of no F160W
coverage, all structure parameters (e.g., kron radius,
a image, b image, flux radius, etc) are measured from
the F850LP mosaic. Furthermore, the total ﬂuxes are
derived based on the F850LP bandpass.

Fig. 9.— Top panels: SExtractors FLUX RADIUS against total
zF850LP (left) and HF160W (right) magnitude. Objects are classi-
ﬁed as point sources (red star symbols) in the catalog on the basis
of ﬂux radii less than the red line and magnitudes brighter than
25 ABmag (red dotted line). Galaxies and uncertain classiﬁcations
(with magnitudes >25 ABmag) are represented with black sym-
bols. Bottom panels: point sources can also be classiﬁed using the
ratio of ﬂuxes in a large and small aperture. Although the tight-
ness of the stellar sequence in this ratio at brighter magnitudes
allows for a more stringent classiﬁcation, the separation becomes
less clear at fainter magnitudes. The ﬂux ratio was used to select
stars for the PSF-matching and kernel ﬁtting (Figure 2).

Additional noteworthy columns include the wmin hst
column, which indicates for any given object the total
number of HST ﬁlters with observed ﬂux measurements.
The z spec column cross-matches the positions of each
object within a radius of 0.4(cid:48)(cid:48) with the compilation of
spectroscopic redshifts referenced in Skelton et al. (2014)
for the GOODS-S ﬁeld.

Finally, perhaps the two most important columns in
the catalog are use f160w and use f850lp. We provide
a ﬂag within the catalog that allows a relatively straight-
forward selection of galaxies that have photometry of rea-
sonably uniform quality. The default “use” ﬂag (listed
as use f160w in the catalog, to distinguish it from spec-
troscopic quality ﬂags) is set to 1 if the following criteria
are met:

• Not a star, or too faint for reliable star/galaxy sep-

aration: star flag = 0 or star flag = 2.

• A detection in F160W. To limit the number of
false positives, we apply a low SNR cut, requiring
f F160W / e F160W > 3.

• Suﬃcient wavelength coverage. We require that a
minimum of ﬁve ﬁlters cover the object. This tends
to removes objects on the edges of the mosaics,
and in gaps. When running photometric redshift
or stellar population synthesis codes, it is common
practice to require a similar threshold in the num-
ber of bandpasses.

Fig. 10.— The eﬀective area of coverage as a function of the
5σ point-source depths for all 13 HST ﬁlters. The area is calcu-
lated where the weight is greater than (1) 1% of the median weight
(black), (2) 0.2% of the maximum weight (grey), or (3) 0.5% of the
maximum weight (light grey). The dotted line represents the area
for a single HST pointing.

The use f160w ﬂag selects approximately 39% of all
objects in the catalogs. Note that this ﬂag is not very
restrictive: for most science purposes further cuts (par-
ticularly on magnitude or SNR) are required. Further-
more, we caution that the ﬂag is not 100% successful
in removing problematic SEDs. Generally speaking, the
overall quality of an SED is higher for galaxies with a
higher SNR in the WFC3 bands.

As noted earlier, there exists wider ﬁeld coverage in the
GOODS-S ﬁeld in the F850LP bandpass. For this reason,
we combine this ﬁlter into the ultra-deep noise-equalized
detection image and adopt it as the reference band where
this is no F160W coverage. We include the use f850lp
column to indicate those objects with F850LP coverage.
The criteria used to deﬁne this ﬂag match the ﬁrst two
listed above, but for F850LP instead of F160W. Objects
with both F160W and F850LP coverage will therefore
be identiﬁed with both use ﬂags. However, use f850lp
is potentially more inclusive by selecting 45% of objects.
Though the user should be warned that not all objects se-
lected by use f850lp will yield robust photometric red-
shifts because there is no requirement set for the min-
imum number of ﬁlters covered. To identify those ob-
jects with F850LP coverage but no F160W coverage (47%
of objects in the catalog), the user should refer to the
detection flag column. For these objects, the median
number of HST ﬁlters with coverage is three, enough to
derive a color but not enough to derive a photometric
redshift.

2.5.3. Error Analysis
It is well known that the errors returned by SExtrac-
tor are underestimated due to the correlations between
pixels introduced during the data reduction process. To
circumvent this issue, we choose to measure the errors
directly from the PSF-matched images themselves by

placing a series of “empty apertures” across the mosaics
(see detailed description in Whitaker et al. 2011). Fig-
ure 10 shows the eﬀective area as a function of the 5σ
point-source depths from the empty aperture analysis.
As many of the ﬁlters include a wide range of varying
depths across the full ﬁeld of view (see, e.g., Figure 1),
we calculate the eﬀective area in three diﬀerent ways:
we select all pixels where the weight is greater than (1)
1% of the median weight (black), (2) 0.2% of the maxi-
mum weight (grey), or (3) 0.5% of the maximum weight
(light grey).
In some ﬁlters the coverage is fairly ho-
mogenous (e.g., F225W-F435W, F098M, F125W), while
in others there is a huge range in depth (e.g., F606W,
F850LP, F140W). The calculations based on the max-
imum weight therefore show a wide range of eﬀective
area for those ﬁlters that combine ultra-deep data with
wide area shallower data. For example, the vast majority
of the F140W weight map is less than 5% of the maxi-
mum weight, with the maximum weight originating from
within the single UDF pointing (Figure 1). This ﬁgure
therefore illustrates which ﬁlters have the most heteroge-
nous sampling in weight, in addition to the typical pa-
rameter space in area and depth covered.

Given the vast range in depth across the GOODS-S
ﬁeld, the error analysis we adopt for the photometric
catalogs is performed on noise-equalized, PSF-matched

images. This ensures that each pixel is weighted by its
corresponding depth, bringing the noise properties to a
level playing ﬁeld. We measure the normalized median
absolute deviation (nmad) from the resulting distribution
of empty aperture values for the given aperture diameter
size of 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48). This σNMAD error is incorporated into the
catalog on an object by object basis by dividing by the
square root of the weight at each object position for each
ﬁlter. This process is repeated for a series of aperture
sizes in order to derive a corresponding error curve for
the Kron radius of each individual object in the catalog
(Figure 11). Given the Kron radius for any object, we use
the best-ﬁt parameters presented in Figure 11 to deﬁne
the corresponding σNMAD error, as deﬁned in Equation
3 of Whitaker et al. (2011). The resulting error can be
found in the e X columns within the catalog, where X
corresponds to each respective ﬁlter.

Figure 12 shows the resulting σNMAD as a function of
HF160W (left panels) and zF850LP magnitude (right pan-
els), as derived from the empty aperture methodology.
Galaxies with use f160w = 1 (or use f850lp) are shown
in black. Otherwise, extended objects with use f160w
= 0 (use f850lp = 0) are shown in purple and point
sources (star flag = 1) in red. The top panels show
the errors measured in the catalog aperture with a diam-
eter of 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48). The striping is a result of combining point-

ings with variable depths; the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
pointing represents the stripes with the smallest errors,
whereas surveys that reach shallower depths but extend
over wider areas will have larger errors. The total error
on HF160W (left) and zF850LP (right) is shown in the mid-
dle panel, determined by scaling the noise (Figure 11) to
match the aperture size of the circularized Kron radius
for each individual object and correcting to total based
on the growth curve (Figure 6). More luminous objects
generally have more extended light proﬁles, which tends
to add a tilt to the total errors such that they scale larger
at the bright end. Finally, the lowest panels in Figure 12
compare the total SNR for HF160W (left) and zF850LP
(right) as a function of each respective magnitude. Gen-
erally, point sources have the highest SNR for a given
magnitude, whereas galaxies with more extended light
proﬁles are roughly 0.5 dex lower. Objects with low SNR
either due to intrinsic faintness or low weight comprise
the lower envelope of the distribution of SNR vs. mag-
nitude. The main diﬀerence between the use f160w and
use f850lp ﬂags is that the latter does not remove ob-
jects with less than 5 ﬁlters of coverage, resulting in a
less stringent cut on the catalog.

3. DATA VERIFICATION
As the 3D-HST GOODS-S photometric catalog pre-
sented in Skelton et al. (2014) has similar F160W cover-
age (171 arcmin2 vs. 207 arcmin2) with a similar suite
of bandpasses, it serves as a natural benchmark to com-
pare to the GOODS-S HLF photometric catalog. In the
following sections, we present basic comparisons between
the photometry and source detection. For all cases, we
present that data when adopting either the use f160w
or use f850lp ﬂags, as noted in each subsequent case.

Fig. 12.— (Top) Error as a function of HF160W (left) and zF850LP
(right) within a 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48) diameter circular aperture. Galaxies (black)
are selected based on use f160w=1 (left; SNRF160W>3, ≥5 HST
ﬁlter coverage, not a star), compared to stars (red) and the re-
maining extended objects (purple) that do not meet this criterion
(use f160w=0 and star flag(cid:54)=1). The right columns instead adopt
the use f850lp ﬂag, where the notable diﬀerence is that while the
zF850LP has wider coverage than HF160W (343 arcmin2 vs. 207
arcmin2), most of the HST ﬁlters do not cover such a wide area.
The use f850lp ﬂag is therefore less restrictive, removing the re-
quirement of ≥5 HST ﬁlters when deﬁning use f850lp. (Middle)
Total errors are scaled from the noise for the given Kron radii for
each individual object, plus an extra correction to total based on
the growth curve analysis of point sources, with the same color-
coding.
(Bottom) The SNR generally increases with decreasing
magnitude, with point sources having the highest SNRs and ex-
tended galaxies lower SNRs for a given magnitude. The striping in
the panels originates from the combination of various surveys that
have a broad of depths.

We further compare to the CANDELS GOODS-S pho-
tometric catalog released by Guo et al. (2013), adopting
flags equal to zero for non-contaminated sources. The
CANDELS GOODS-S catalog presents the multiwave-
length (UV to mid-IR) photometry, with source detection
performed in the WFC3 HF160W mosaic using a “hot”
and “cold” detection methodology. We ﬁrst present the
number counts in Section 3.1 and then cross match all
catalogs within a 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48) radius to compare aperture pho-
tometry in Section 3.2. Finally, in Section 3.3, we show
several example SEDs to showcase the high quality of the
photometry.

3.1. Number Counts
The number density of galaxies that satisfy the
use f160w criterion in the GOODS-S ﬁeld are shown in
Figure 13 as a function of the total HF160W magnitude for
both HLF (black), 3D-HST (red), and CANDELS (blue).

11

of the number count histogram. When combined, we
recover the original distribution. To compare the abso-
lute and relative depths, we calculate the HF160W depths
in each quartile using the empty aperture method de-
scribed in Section 2.5.3. The HLF GOODS-S F160W
mosaic reaches a 5σ limiting point-source depth (within
an aperture of radius 0.35(cid:48)(cid:48)) of 27.0 and 29.8 ABmag in
the bottom and top quartiles, respectively, with a depth
of 28.7 ABmag in the middle quartiles. The diﬀerence
between the shallow and deep regions is 3 magnitudes.
These measurements suggest that the HLF mosaics are
deeper than the earlier compilation presented in Guo
et al. (2013), given that their quoted depth in the HUDF
is similar (29.7 ABmag), but calculated within an aper-
ture that is a factor of two smaller.

We additionally show the number density of galax-
ies as a function of total zF850LP magnitude using the
use f850lp criterion in the GOODS-S ﬁeld for both HLF
and 3D-HST in Figure 16. The total area covered within
the HLF GOODS-S catalog is almost a factor of two
larger than the 3D-HST survey, with coverage for 314
arcmin2 (assuming weights greater than 0.5% of the max-
imum weight). Despite the signiﬁcantly wider areal cov-
erage, the number counts reveal similar depth data when
directly comparing the faint end. However, the advan-
tages of surveying a wider swath of the sky is evident at
the bright end, where HLF is able to better sample the
demographics of the bright, rare galaxies.

3.2. Comparison with Other Surveys
Measuring total ﬂuxes for objects within any data set
requires certain assumptions to be made.
It is there-
fore worthwhile to compare measurements to assess the
quality of the photometry. Such analyses are often in-
valuable in uncovering potential bugs within the cat-
alogs. Though the mosaics themselves were produced
completely independent of one another, the methodol-
ogy adopted to extract the photometry is largely the
same between the HLF and 3D-HST photometric cat-
alogs. We therefore choose to ﬁrst cross-match the HLF
catalog with the v4.1.5 photometric catalogs publicly re-
leased by the 3D-HST team. In Figure 17, we then com-
pare the total magnitudes. We additionally compare the
HLF GOODS-S photometric catalog to the more recent
HDUV photometric catalogs for F225W, F275W, and
F336W (Oesch et al. 2018), where the construction of
this catalog followed the same methodology as 3D-HST
and adopts the same segmentation map. The notable
diﬀerence between the 3D-HST/HDUV and HLF cata-
logs is that 3D-HST performs a zero point correction,
whereas we do not add this step for the HST-only HLF
photometric catalog. The oﬀsets between the photome-
try are generally quite small, with the red curve showing
the running median in Figure 17. The ﬁlter with the
largest oﬀset is F435W. We note that this is the same
ﬁlter with the 3D-HST GOODS-S catalog that had an
oﬀset of -0.09 magnitude applied. When accounting for
this, the photometry is in closer agreement relative to the
original HST zero points. Indeed, when accounting for
the zero point oﬀset applied to the 3D-HST photometry,
all HST ﬁlters agree within <0.06 mag. In other words,
the photometry typically agrees at the few percent level.
Next, we directly compare the HST/ACS (F435W,
F606W, F775W, F814W, and F850LP), and WFC3

Fig. 13.— Number counts of galaxies with Poisson errors in the
GOODS-S ﬁeld as a function HF160W total magnitude, with no cor-
rection for incompleteness. The agreement between HLF (black),
3D-HST (red) and CANDELS (blue) is excellent.

The error bars are Poisson. Though completely indepen-
dent data reductions, the three data sets are fairly simi-
lar in terms of F160W coverage; HLF covers 207 arcmin2
in HF160W, whereas CANDELS covers 173 arcmin2 and
3D-HST covers 171 arcmin2. It is therefore not surpris-
ing that the number counts are consistent. The deﬁcit
of sources with HF160W∼26 ABmag in CANDELS rela-
tive to the two other ﬁelds is likely the result of using a
deeper multi-band combined detection image. The fur-
ther excess of objects at the faint end in HLF results
from a combination of eﬀects. In part, this population of
faint sources will arise due to the more aggressive source
detection settings adopted. But in some cases, it is clear
that the HLF F160W imaging is deeper than the earlier
3D-HST version (i.e., explaining why both 3D-HST and
HLF have more faint number counts), but HLF appears
to further reveal an exciting new population of extremely
faint sources. Figure 14 shows 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48)×1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) postage stamps
(zF814W, JF125W, HF160W) of 48 ultra-faint sources with
magnitudes between 28 and 29 ABmag rank ordered by
SNR that are identiﬁed in the HLF photometric catalog
but do not have a match within a radius of 0.4(cid:48)(cid:48) in the
3D-HST photometric catalog.

The depths in the HLF GOODS-S mosaic vary signif-
icantly within the ﬁeld (i.e., HUDF, CANDELS deep,
wide, ERS, etc.). Such a heterogeneous weight map im-
plies that the single number count histogram shown in
Figure 13 is simply the superposition of the histograms
at diﬀerent depths.
In order to better understand the
improvement, we separate the weight map into four quar-
tiles that mark diﬀerent depths in Figure 15. If we con-
sider the top quartile with the highest weights (deepest
data), we see that this histogram completely dominates
the faint end number counts. As expected, sources with
the lowest weights (i.e., the shallowest data) are shifted
towards higher magnitudes and dominate the bright end

etry is consistently slightly fainter than HLF. However,
we note that this is only noticeable at the faintest mag-
nitudes that are close to the detection limits of the data.
Overall, the two catalogs agree remarkably well.

While we motivate our decisions herein for detection
and analysis of mass-selected (K-band selected) samples
of galaxies, there exist many surveys that adopt diﬀer-
ent but equally viable techniques. We therefore further
include a comparison with UVUDF survey in Figure 19
(Rafelski et al. 2015), which adopts similar methodology
to the CANDELS photometric catalogs at optical and
NIR wavelengths and a special analysis of the UVIS ﬁl-
ters. While the UVUDF photometric catalogs measures
the colors of galaxies based on their isophotal ﬂuxes fol-
lowing the results of Ben´ıtez et al. (2004), we adopt a
small circular aperture ﬂux that maximizes the SNRs.
The correction to total ﬂuxes is also diﬀerent between
the catalogs: while both scale to total using the Kron
aperture, the HLF catalog includes an additional cor-
rection that is typically of order 10–20% to account for
the light outside of the Kron aperture using our curve of
growth analysis. This explains the oﬀset in the NIR ﬁl-
ters, at least in part. The other notable diﬀerence for
the UVUDF photometry is that the F435W image is
used as the detection when measuring the UVIS pho-
tometry, bridging between the UVIS ﬁlters and F160W.
This results in slightly lower ﬂuxes measured in the
UVUDF photometry as compared to HLF, especially at
the faintest magnitudes. Diﬀerences in background sub-
traction may also contribute to the discrepancies.

We explore the consequences of our IR-based detec-
tion methodology relative to the UVIS ﬂuxes measured
in Figure 20 in further detail. Here, we select galax-
ies in the HLF catalog where the use f160w ﬂag equals
unity and the SNR is greater than 20 in F160W. The

sets are largely independent of one another, the ﬁnal re-
sults are consistent. There does exist a weak trend with

galaxies (circles) are separated into bins of F160W mag-
nitude ranging from 18 to 26 ABmag, as indicated with
the color-coding. For all galaxies within each respec-
tive bin, we measure the ratio of the ﬂux within increas-
ing circular apertures relative to a maximum aperture
of diameter 3 arcseconds using SExtractor on the PSF
matched images for the full suite of HST photometry.
The mean of this distribution is plotted as a function of
aperture diameter, with error bars indicating the error in
the mean. We repeat this for stars with SNR greater than
20 in F160W (red star symbols). For reference, we show
the galaxy growth curves in the F160W image as dotted

lines in all panels. The grey shaded region demarcates
the 1σ uncertainties from the empty aperture analysis,
where any points close to this region are essentially pure
noise. While the images used in this analysis have been
homogenized, galaxies can still exhibit diﬀerent intrinsic
light proﬁles as a function of wavelength. This is particu-
larly pertinent at (rest-frame) ultraviolet wavelengths, as
galaxy morphologies at these wavelengths not only can
vary quite drastically outside 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48) but their structures
can also have signiﬁcant diﬀerences at rest-frame optical
and rest-frame FUV wavelengths (e.g., Elmegreen et al.
2007, 2009; Soto et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2018).

In Figure 20, we see clear trends with magnitude that
are consistent from F606W through F160W. Brighter
galaxies are more extended and therefore have slower
curves of growth, while stars have the most compact
light proﬁles. While the results are consistent in most
ﬁlters, deviations begin to arise in the F435W ﬁlter at
the 10% level within 1 arcsecond and become quite dra-
matic in the F225W-F336W ﬁlters.
In this ﬁgure, we
are comparing photometry for the same set of objects
that have been identiﬁed and categorized based on their
F160W photometry. The dramatic diﬀerences blueward
of F435W relate to the fact that these F160W-selected
objects do not have much intrinsic ﬂux in the ultraviolet;
all of the magnitude bins, both bright and faint, lie close
to the 1σ limit of pure noise (grey shaded region). This
is a known problem when trying to select stars to gen-
erate point spread functions and hence why we identify
the stars using the individual ﬁlters and not a master list
based on the deep F160W image.

If we instead select stars and galaxies in bins of mag-
nitude deﬁned separately for each ﬁlter, we are only con-
sidering objects that are well detected at each respective
wavelength. We compare the curves of growth for these
populations in Figure 21. Here, we adopt the same SNR
requirement of at least 20, but in each respective ﬁlter
instead of F160W alone. This tells a slightly diﬀerent
story. The light proﬁles based on the homogenized im-
ages are similar from F435W through F160W, with de-
viations in the UVIS ﬁlters now on the order of 5-8%
within 1 arcsecond diameter. We suspect these residual
diﬀerences may arise because the intrinsic light proﬁles
in the UVIS ﬁlters are slightly more extended relative
to the rest-optical light, even when convolved with the
PSF. As we correct to total ﬂux based on the fraction
of light in F160W outside of our 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48) aperture diameter,
this could result in an under-correction at the these short
wavelengths, which would serve to increase the discrep-
ancies between the UVUDF and HLF UV photometry.
This eﬀect may be further augmented by the diﬀerent
depths in the UVIS ﬁlters; the F435W photometry is
deeper than UVIS and also shows better agreement with
the rest of the HLF photometry in Figures 20 and 21.
Clumpy galaxy structure in the FUV will also contribute
to the scatter, as evident in Figure 19. The main impli-
cation of our methodology is that the SED shapes we
extract are dominated by the centers of galaxies and any
strong gradients will be missed.

3.3. Example Spectral Energy Distributions
To showcase the quality of the HLF-GOODS-S pho-
tometric catalog, Figure 22 shows the SEDs of a small
sample of galaxies at z>6 with high SNRs in the near-
IR HST ﬁlters. The coverage for these galaxies ranges
from nine to thirteen HST ﬁlters. At these extreme high
redshifts, the majority of the ﬁlters are sampling blue-
ward of the Lyman break. The combination of deep,
high resolution imaging with broad wavelength coverage
results in robust constraints on the photometric redshift
probability distribution functions (PDF).

Photometric redshifts are derived for these examples
using the EAZY code (Brammer et al. 2008), which ﬁts
linear combinations of seven templates to the broadband
SEDs. This template set is optimized to be large enough
to span a broad range of galaxy colors while minimizing

color and redshift degeneracies, as described in detail in
Brammer et al. (2008). An additional template is added
of an old, red galaxy, following Whitaker et al. (2011).
We adopt z peak as the photometric redshift, which ﬁnds
discrete peaks in the redshift probability function and
returns the peak with the largest integrated probability.
The inset panels of Figure 22 show the PDFs, each with
a unique, well-deﬁned photometric redshift solution.

After ﬁxing to the photometric redshift, we ﬁt this
high redshift sample with the Prospector code, a
new Bayesian framework speciﬁcally designed to use
broad-band photometry to constrain high-dimensional,
self-consistent models of galaxy formation (Leja et al.
2017). The best-ﬁt models and realistic error bars are
shown in Figure 22, with stellar masses ranging from
log(M(cid:63)/M(cid:12))=9.4 to 10.8. Future forced photometry of
longer wavelength Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC imaging
will help break possible degeneracies between dust and
age, especially for the highest redshift galaxy shown here
(bottom right). We return to the ﬁdelity with which pho-
tometric redshifts and stellar population parameters can
be calculated based on NUV to NIR HST photometry
alone to caution the users of this catalog in the following
section.

4. SUMMARY
In this manuscript, we describe the data analysis
methodology employed to generate high quality pho-
tometric catalogs based on the v2.0 mosaics released
through the Hubble Legacy Fields (HLF) project in the
GOODS-S ﬁeld. The details of the data reduction can be
found in Illingworth et al. (2016) and Oesch et al. (2018).
Here, we homogenize the 13 HST bandpasses,
in-
cluding three WFC3/UVIS ﬁlters (F225W, F275W
and F336W), ﬁve ACS/WFC ﬁlters (F435W, F606W,
F775W, F814W and F850LP) and ﬁve WFC3/IR ﬁlters
(F098M, F105W, F125W, F140W and F160W). We use
an ultra-deep detection image that combines the PSF-
homogenized, noise-equalized F850LP, F125W, F140W
and F160W mosaics. Photometry is extracted in 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48)
diameter apertures and corrected to total ﬂuxes based
on the F160W curve of growth (or F850LP curve of
growth in the case where there is no F160W coverage).
The photometric catalog includes 187,464 objects, with
a suggested ﬁrst selection based either (1) use f160w,
which selects galaxies with SNR>3 in F160W and cov-
erage in >5 HST bandpasses, or (2) use f850lp, which
selects galaxies covering a wider on-sky area by requir-
ing SNR>3 in F850LP but no minimum coverage of HST
bandpasses.

While the HLF dataset comprises the deepest mosaics
of the cosmos to date, they are by no means meant to
compensate for a lack of longer wavelength bands or
more ancillary ground-based data. We caution users
of the HLF GOODS-S photometric catalog that deriv-
ing accurate stellar masses requires longer wavelength
data (Wuyts et al. 2007; Marchesini et al. 2009).
In
particular, Muzzin et al. (2009) show that including
Spitzer /IRAC data is critical when only broadband data
(no spectroscopy) are available, improving contraints on
M(cid:63), SFR, and AV by factors of 4, 2.5, and 0.5 mag,
respectively. However, Muzzin et al. also show that
Spitzer /IRAC data only modestly improves the photo-
metric redshifts of galaxies at z∼2, whereas deep NIR

catalogs, constructed based on a diﬀerent set of assumptions and algorithms. Overall, the running median (red) line shows good agreement
between the two catalogs, with small zero point oﬀsets at NIR wavelengths and weak trends with magnitude in a few cases (e.g., F225W,
F275W, F336W, F850LP).

proﬁles at these wavelengths. The ridge of the grey shaded region is deﬁned by the 1σ errors derived in the empty aperture analysis. The

photometry (such as that provided by the HLFs) is
far more valuable in constraining photometric redshifts.
Bezanson et al. (2016) further investigate the impact of
various ﬁlter combinations on the photometric redshift
accuracy (see their Figure 12), ﬁnding that the inclusion
of Spitzer /IRAC photometry, blue (F435W) HST pho-
tometry, and medium-band ﬁlters particularly in the op-
tical can have a dramatic impact (see also Whitaker et al.
2011). Relevant to the present catalog, Bezanson et al.
ﬁnd that the inclusion of blue (F435W) imaging in the
3D-HST GOODS photometric catalogs signiﬁcantly im-
proves both the scatter and outlier fractions. As our HLF
GOODS-S catalog includes additional shorter wavelenth
UV data, it is relevant to note that Rafelski et al. (2015)
ﬁnd similar improvements in the photometric redshifts.
Rafelski et al. (2015) demonstrate that adding NUV data
to the photometric redshift derivations, in addition to
the optical and NIR, gave a mild improvement in the
scatter and a roughly a factor of 2 improvement in the
outlier fraction, with a mild depencency on the redshift
epoch under consideration. So while the present HLF
GOODS-S catalog will be improved in future work, with
the complementary Spitzer /IRAC analysis in particular
for the derivation of robust stellar population physical
paramaters, results in the literature conﬁrm that com-
bining HST resolution optical and NIR data with NUV
already marks a notable improvement in the photometric
redshift accuracy.
