I.  INTRODUCTION 

The concept of model-based Reinforcement learning 

(RL) [1-3]provides a competitive approach to control 

dynamical  frameworks.  In  such  strategies,  the  models  of 
the  framework’s  elements  play  a  key  role  in  control  and 
have  effectively  delivered  RL  agents  that  outperform 
human players in many such continuous control problems. 
Although  these  outcomes  are  imposing,  methods  that  are 
not  based  on  models  (model-free)  have  not  still  been 
advantageously  utilized  to  control  such  physical  aerial 
frameworks . It is a common belief that that model-based 
strategies  provide  better  sample  complexity  than  the 
model-free  searching  strategies  that  explore  the  space  of 
actions  for  autonomous  control  tasks.  Such  beliefs  are 
dispelled  by  the  use  of  the  proposed  simple  searching 
strategy  which  takes  advantage  of  eliminating  the  use  of 
excessive  data  to  train  neural  networks  and  matches  the 
state-of-the-art  accuracy  for  such  tasks  by  a  random 
search in the policy space. 

Continuous  control  tasks  are  majorly  addressed  using 
state-of- the-art RL  methods  and strategies on agents for 
good  and  sample  efficient  results.  Quadcopter  control. 
Several previous works by authors suggest the use of RL 
with  Least  Square  policy  Iteration(LSPI)  [4]  to  learn 
optimum  control  policies  for  quadcopter  control.  Few 
works  also  indicate  the  use  of  state-  of-the-art  RL 
algorithms  like  DDPG,  TRPO  and  PPO  to  perform  such 
tasks  [5].  But,  there  exist  few  elements  precluding  the 
reception  of  RL  methods  for  controlling  these  physical 
frameworks: the strategies demand a lot of information to 
accomplish  sensible  execution,  the  regularly  expanding 
combination  of  RL  techniques  tend  to  make  it  hard  to 
pick  what 
technique  for  a  particular 
undertaking  and  numerous  applicant  calculations  are 
difficult to utilize.

Tragically the momentum pattern in RL based research 
has put these hindrances inconsistent with one another. In 
this mission to discover strategies that test productive (i.e. 
techniques  that  need  very  little  information),  the  general 
pattern  has  been  to  develop  progressively  convoluted 
solutions to such continuous control problems [8,9]. This

Also,  policy-based  learning  [16,17]  on  any  aerial 
system is frequently demonstrated in autonomous control 
literature.  This  work  has  shown  that  natural  policy 
gradients  can  be  used  to  train  linear  policies  to  obtain 
to  continuous  control 
high-performance 
problems like a quadcopter flying. The simulation shows 
that  a  more  dynamically  characterized  motion  can  be 
accomplished through a simple augmented random search 
technique.  This  work  combines  the  ideas  of  background 
research done on quadcopter control using reinforcement 
learning  techniques  and  a  high  performance  simple 
random  searching  technique  called  augmented  random 
search[18]. The main contribution of this research is done 
by  introducing  an  alternative,  better  and  faster  learning 
algorithm  to  train  a  quadcopter  to  fly  without  using 
model-based  deterministic  on-policy  methods  of 
reinforcement 
learning.  This  works  on  a  simple 
derivative-free  optimization  strategy  which  can  surpass 
the  results  of  using  a  zero-bias,  zero-variance  samples 
used in reinforcement learning strategies. 

Our  work  contributes  to  the  task  of  controlling  the 

quadcopter’s flight in the following ways, 

1.  Building  the  physical  simulator  structure  and 
framework  of  the  agent  which  will  perform  the 
task of flying (Quadflytask). 

2.  Strategically  designing  the  task  environment  that 
defines  the  goal  and  provides  feedback  to  the 
agent 

3.  Using  the  augmented  random  search  algorithm 
ARS-  Quad  for  the  online  normalization  of  states 
and updating rewards to help the agent learn. 

II.  RELATED WORK 

The  presented  approach  uses  a  derivative-free  policy 
optimization method[20] whose early interpretations have 
been proposed for facilitating future research on RL. 

Salimans et al. [3] accomplished a similar strategy called 
the  Evolution  strategies  which  showed  that  this  method 
could  easily  be  used  for  training  policies  faster  than 
alternative  methods  of  performing  such  tasks.  The 
algorithm proposed by Saliman et al. [3] involved several 
complicated algorithmic details in spite of being simpler 
than  previously  proposed  methods.  Another  simplified 
approach  for  the  derivative-free  policy  and  model-free 
RL  was  proposed  by  Rajeshwaran  et  al.  [6]  which 
showed the use of natural policy gradients for continuous 
control  tasks.  Apart  from  this,  various  interpretations  of 
quadcopter control have also come to the forefront by the 
use  of  deterministic  ways  of  policy  optimization  using  a 
natural gradient descent. 

Extending  the  idea  of  using  deterministic  policies 
instead of stochastic policies to control the quadcopter the 
present  work  has  been  put  into  picture.  Controlling  the 
quadcopter  using  stochastic  policy  [19]  can  lead  to 
the 
unpredictable  performance  and  does  not  serve 
purpose.  Also  using  deterministic  policy  optimization 
over stochastic policy optimization gives the privileges of 
having lower variance of value  estimates  from on-policy 
samples.  Deterministic  policy  gradient  methods  [20] 
requires  a  good  strategy  for  exploration  to  explore  the 
state  space,  unlike  the  stochastic  strategy  based  policy 
gradient. 

Any reinforcement learning problem requires searching 
for policies to control dynamical  frameworks or systems 
that  can  maximize  an  average  reward  given  to  the  agent 
by the system. Such problems can be stated as, 

max E 𝜉[ r ( 𝜋𝜃 , 𝜉 )] 

(1) 

In  (1),  𝜃  characterizes  a  basic  policy  𝜋𝜃:  ℝn  →  ℝ𝑚. 
Also,  the  random  variable  𝜉  shows  the  randomness  and 
unplanned  nature  of  the  environment  chosen  to  perform 
tasks  i.e  variable  initial  states  and  transitions  which  are 
stochastic  in  nature.  For  the  same  policy  𝜋𝜃  on  one 
direction or trajectory generated by the framework, value 
[  (𝜋𝜃,  𝜉  )]  is  the  reward  gained  by  training  the  policy. 
Taking all this into consideration, the deep reinforcement 
learning  techniques  use  stochastic  policies  for  such 
problems  but  the  ARS  use  for  the  flying  task  of 
quadcopter  uses  deterministic  policies  [21].  Random 
searching techniques have been the oldest and one of the 
simplest  methods  of  carrying  out  optimization  which  is 
supposed  to  be  derivative-free  just  by  making  use  of 
approximation  of  finite-difference  along  chosen  variable 
and random directions. 

Augmented  random  search  (ARS)  [18,21]  has  proved 
to be the best breakthrough in this regard which relies on 
the  various  augmentations  of  basic  random  search  to 
build  on  accomplished  and  proven  heuristics  that  were 
earlier utilized in deep reinforcement learning techniques. 
ARS  simplifies  the  problem  of  using  deep  neural 
networks  and  calculating  the  action  value  functions  by  
the  transformation  of  rankings  from  rewards  and  using 
these rankings to form the update steps for the quadcopter 
to learn the trajectory. It helps the agent to bin the action 
space to encourage exploration.Work done on quadcopter

III.  METHODOLOGY 

The  following  section  recounts  the  method  that  is 
employed  in  the  present  work  for  the  training  of  the 
policy  for  a  quadcopter.  The  rationality  and  viability  of 
the  method  employed  should  be  further  examined  and 
extended in the future. 

A.  Physical Framework 

The  helicopter  is  an  aerial  vehicle  that  uses  briskly 
spinning rotors  which pushes air downwards to keep the 
helicopter skyward. This can be perceived as rotors, two 
in  number,  which  are  supposed  to  be  coplanar  both 
providing  thrust  in  the  same  direction  i.e.  upwards  but 
revolving in the opposite direction. 

A quadrotor, usually called a quadcopter, is a  form of 
helicopter which has four rotors equally spaced, generally 
disposed  at  the  corners  of  a  body,  square  in  shape. 
Controlling  a  Quadcopter  is  essentially  tedious  to  solve 
and  an 
interesting  problem.  The  dynamics  of  the 
quadcopter  [22-26]  are  highly  non-linear,  taking  into 
account  the  extensive  aerodynamic  effects.  Also  since 
quadcopters  have  only  slight  amounts  of  friction  to 
intercept  their  trajectory  of  motion,  so  they  have  to 
facilitate their damping to halt the movement and remain 
steady.

This  work  uses 

and 
a  very 
uncomplicated  model  for  simulation  purposes  as  for  the 
purpose  to  be  served  one  does  not  need  to  jump  into 
every  attribute  of  the  quadcopter.  We  can  disregard  all 
the  drag  forces  being  acted  upon  on  the  quadcopter’s 
body  and  utilize  a  simple  and  fairly  elementary  body 
model  with  the  basic  idea  of  having  four  thrust/propel 
forces acting on its body. 

Fig.1. Agent (Quadcopter) reward mechanism 

Fig.  1  illustrates  the  reward  mechanism  of  the  agent 
and the interconnection of its components that will help in 
simulation.  It  shows  how  the  agent’s  control  system 
interprets  instructions  from  the  environment  to  gain 
rewards.  The  agent’s  behavior  is  governed  by  a  set  of 
parameters  (implemented  as  routines)  which  are  as 
follows, 

  Earth to Body frame  – It takes three inputs as the 
inputs  of  inertial  axes  to  decide  the  earth-based 
origin at the launch location. 

  Body  to  earth  frame  –  Takes  the  same  inputs  to 
decide  the  center  of  gravity  of  the  quadrotor 
aligned along the given frame. 

  Simulation Function – Takes the inputs in the form 
of  the  initial  position  of  the  quadcopter,  initial 
velocity  and  initial  angular  velocity  with  the 
default probable runtime of the engine. 

  Propeller thrust – A routine that calculates the net 
thrust based on the velocity of the quadcopter. 
  Propeller  wind  speed  –  A  routine  that  calculates 
the  propeller  speed  from  the  angular  velocity  and 
body velocity data.

B.  Task Environment 

The  research  work  evaluates  the  performance  of  ARS 
on  the  continuous  control  problem  of  making  aerial 
frameworks  and  systems  like  quadcopters  fly  as  tasks 
included  in  the  environment  created  using  the  robot-like 
simulation  model of the agent i.e the quadcopter. A task 
environment [10] is a set of states that the agent is trying 
to  influence  through  the  choice  of  its  actions.  So  the 
structure of the task environment depends broadly on the 
signals  which  are  relevant  to  the  task,  and  how  they 
interact.  The  boundary  between  the  agent  and  the  task 
environment  can  be  chosen  at  different  and  separate 
places  and  for  different  purposes.  In  particular,  the 
boundary  of  agent-environment  is  to  determined  when 
one  has  particular  areas  selected,  specific  actions  and 
rewards,  thereby  has  established  a  specific  task  of 
decision  making  for  the  interest.  The  task  environment 
performs  the  function  of  defining  a  goal  and  provides 
feedback to the agent.

The Augmented random search (ARS) algorithm relies 
on the augmentations of the  basic version of the  random 
search algorithm that is in turn built on accomplished and 
proven heuristics which is utilized in deep reinforcement 
learning  strategies  and  techniques  [28-31].  The  prime 
problem  of  policy  search  based  on  augmentation  can  be 
formulated  and  analyzed  as  being  a  continuous  problem 
of searching i.e a continuous search problem. The various 
operations  in  the  task  of  flying  the  quadcopter  are 
performed in a definite order and the search space is also 
continuous,  which  helps to  make  sure𝑖    that𝑖   the  process of 
searching  is  diverse  and  simple.  The  main  idea  of 
quadcopter control using augmented random search is to 
search from the parameter space the best possible policy 
𝜋𝜃.  In  a  more  detailed  form,  it  analyzes  a  series  of 
possible  directions  in  the  parameter  space  to  collect 
appropriate  rewards  and  keep  on  optimizing  the  step 
along  each  such  possible  direction  to  form  the  best 
possible policy. 

To  optimize  the  steps  in  each  possible  direction  to 
reach  the  goal  of  forming  the  final  best  policy,  the 
algorithm  performs  the  update  of  each  perturbation 
direction  by  calculating  the  difference  of  the  rewards  r 
(𝜋i , j, + ) and r (𝜋i , j, -). This routine estimates the step to 
move  in  a  specific  direction.  Also,with  this  the  updating 
process  has  been  improved  by  eradication  of  update  steps 
calculations  for  the  directions  that  result  in  the  least 
improvement  of  reward.  The  use  of  such  a  technique  can 
assure  that  update  steps  employed  are  averaged  over  the 
directions that have gained high and quality rewards [32,33].

The  code  used  to  simulate  the  quadcopter  and  its  task 
environment  is  written  for  this  research  work  to  ensure 
that it is both accurate numerically and performance wise 
and  also  stable.  Since  the  simulation  task  is  also  written 
in  python,  the  time  required  for  the  computation  for  the 
dynamics to be integrated is far less than otherwise using 
deep  neural  networks  for  the  same  purpose  in  case  of 
quadcopter  control  using  deep  reinforcement  learning 
techniques.

The three essential steps for the quadcopter to learn its 

trajectory of motion is the following: 

1.  Normalization  of  states:  The  state  normalization 
process  is  an  important  step  in  such  regression 
similar  tasks  because  it  fortifies  that  the  policies 
put  equal  weights  on  the  different  and  in-process 
state  components.  This  helps  in  balancing  the 
control  gain  by  making  it  larger  for  the  smaller 
state  coordinates  and  leading  to  smaller  gains 
concerning larger state coordinates. 

2.  Scaling  using  standard  deviation:  Searching 
randomly  in  the  policy  space  can  result  in  large 
differences in the reward gained as the training of 
the policies progresses, as a result, it updates steps 
vary  in  steps  and  it  becomes  difficult  to  choose  a 
fixed  step  size.  Thus  the  rewards  are  transformed 
into rankings to compute the update step. 

3.  Using  top-performing  actions  or  directions  with 

the best average rewards for the update step 

The ARS algorithm used here with slight modification 
is  taken  and  modified  to  our  needs  for  the  quadcopter 
flying task from the paper of Horia mania et al. [18]

the  agent’s  reward  collection  and  thus  the  authors 
implement step response functions, takeoff() and

action  to  move  to  a  next  state.  After  the  reward  for  an 
ended episode is collected the agent parameters are reset 
using  the  reset()  routine.  The  task  environment  is 
primarily responsible to initialize a task to be performed 
by the agent in order to get rewards.

for  the  agent's  behavior  starts  with  setting  up  of  task- 
specific  hyperparameters  consisting  of  number  of  steps 
(set to 200) , episode length  (set to 1000) , learning rate 
(set to 0.01), number of directions (set to 16) , number of 
best  directions  (set  to  4)  for  specific  random  seed  and 
noise values. 

The  policy  where  the  agent  performs  exploration  is 
then implemented. It is a function that takes states of the 
environment as inputs and returns the actions in order to 
help  the  agent  learn  the  task.  The  agent  performs 
exploration  over  a  space  of  such  policies  using  the 
explore() routine and converges to the one that returns the 
best  actions  or  actions  with  the  greatest  positive  reward. 
The  agent  performs  policy  exploration  on  one  specific 
direction over one episode and the rewards are collected 
in  a  shared  noise  data  file  using  a  tracer()  routine.  The 
shared  file  is  used  to  perform  visualizations  using 
Matplotlib and plotly. 

As the agent selectively chooses the best step response 
by  exploration,  the  space  of  policies  over  an  episode  is 
updated  the  reward  obtained  after  each  update  is  plotted 
using matplotlib and plotly. The degree to which an agent 
learns and how fastly depends on the number of positive 
rewards  collected  over  an  episode. 
and  negative 
Therefore,  in  order  to  compare  the  behavior  of  the  two 
agents,  ARS-Quad  which  uses  the  random  searching 
strategy for exploration and DDPG which uses the state- 
of-the-art  deep  deterministic  policy  gradient  method  for 
exploration,  separate  simulations  were  carried  out  over 
1000  episodes  for  the  same  Quad_Fly  task  ,  results  of 
which  are  presented  in  Fig.  4  and  Fig.  5.  The  code  was 
initially  run  on  Intel  Core  i5-5200U@2.8GHz  with  16  
GB  RAM  and  Nvidia  Geforce  Graphics  where  it  gives 
optimal performance results. The final code was also run 
on  Intel  Pentium  CPU  4405U  @2.1GHz  showing  the 
feasibility of running the algorithm on slow-processors.

ensure that the workers through the shared noise data file 
can interface the indices. Moritz et al. [7] have used such 
an approach for the  implementation of evolution strategy 
in  continuous  control  problems  and  also  parallel  to  the 
approach of Salimans et al. [3] . In the presented work the 
random seed generators to facilitate the workers have also 
been  set.  To  ensure  a  diverse  sample  efficiency  the 
random seeds are kept distinct to each other. The training 
process was repeated 100 times with different and distinct 
random  seeds  and  set  of  hyperparameters  as  discussed 
above to achieve a thorough searching of the policy space.

ARS-Quad  agent’s  choice  of  actions  for  each  rotor  per

selects an action for each rotor to set the revolutions per

quadcopter. All the graphs represent the physical motion 
of the quadcopter over 1000 episodes.

The Fig. 2 shows the rewards per epoch of training and 
the sum of average rewards per epoch. The  increase and 
decrease  of  the  average  rewards  per  epoch  shows  that 
when the Agent A performs a set of actions (𝒂𝟏, 𝒂𝟐 … 
𝒂𝑵) in the action space S, the rewards and penalties are 
applied on it in order to make the agent learn i.e help the 
quadcopter learn the correct trajectory of  motion [34,35] 
by penalizing for each wrong takeoff/step and rewarding 
for  each  correct  takeoff/step  and  movement  towards  the 
direction which provides the best rewards. It also fortifies 
the  fact  that  as  the  epoch  increases  the  perturbation 
directions that provide minimalistic reward improvement 
are penalized and removed.

The  following  section  of  the  study  shows  a  compare

algorithmic  approach  called  DDPG(Deep  deterministic

strategy  presented  as  ARS-Quad.  The  comparison  is 
established  by  evaluating  and  analyzing  plots  of  total 
rewards  earned  in  each  episode  along  with  plots  of  how 
the  quadcopter  physically  behaved  for  each  of  the  two 
agents  for  the  same  Quadfly  task.  The  ARS-Quad 
furnishes  results  that  show  optimum  and  substantial 
parallelism between the two different strategies of flying 
the quadcopter. While on one hand, DDPG uses complex 
neural  net  architecture  for  the  task,  ARS-Quad  uses  the 
Algorithm I to perform the same task giving competitive 
results.

the  hyperparameters  for  the  DDPG  agent  were  carefully 
chosen  depending  on  the  neural  net  architecture,  unlike 
ARS-Quad  which  used  few  and  comparatively  less

hyperparameters  are  changed  is  equivalent  to  its  success

experiments,  therefore,  gave  ARS-  Quad  a  competitive 
performance edge in the Quadflytask.

C.  DDPG vs ARS-Quad Agents 

This section recounts of the behavior of both the agents 
in  the  simulated  environment  with  details  on  how  the 
agents physically behaved during the simulation.

quite  competitive  to  the  reward  collection  of  the  DDPG 
agent.  The  graph  show  that  towards  the  end  of  the  100 
episodes  of  the  simulation  ARS-Quad  agent’s  average 
reward  dips  down  to  around  -40,  but  this  dip  is  a  small 
spot  when  comparing  it  to  the  prior  results  of  the  same 
simulation  for  200,  400,  600  and  800  episodes.  This 
indicates  that  we  could  expect  the  average  reward  to 
continue  to  converge  to  around  -10  or  below  over 
subsequent episodes and shows that the agent is very well 
learning the task. 

The  following  graphs  in  Fig.6  and  Fig.7  represent  the 
observation  of  how  the  quadcopter  physically  behaved 
during  the  1000  episodes  of  simulation  for  both,  the 
DDPG  agent  and  the  ARS-Quad  agent  on  the  same 
Quadfly  task.  The  graphs  in  Fig.  6  and  Fig.  7  indicates 
how well the DDPG and ARS-Quad agents were able to 
learn  the  goal  of  the  Quadfly  task.  In  the  experimental 
setup,  the  copter  begins  each  episode  at  (0.,  0.  ,10.0)  as 
the  initial  position  and  is  supposed  to  remain  in  this 
position indefinitely In the two figures, the graphs at the 
upper left corner represent the average position in  x, y, z 
values of the quadcopter across all episodes at the first n 
timesteps,  where  n  is  the  average  episode  duration  in 
timesteps. The graph proves to be the best indicator of the 
behavior  of  quadcopter  overall  episodes  on  the  whole. 
The graphs in the upper right corner of Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 
show  the  variation  of  quadcopters  location  in  x,  y  ,  z 
values  at  each  timestep  during  the  episode  when  the 
quadcopter earned its highest total reward. 

Fig.5. Reward earned by ARS-Quad agent on the Quadfly task 

In  Fig.  4,  the  graph  on  the  left  represents  the  total 
rewards earned in each episode of the Quadfly task by the 
DDPG  agent  along  with  the  running  average  reward  of 
the previous ten episodes (n=10). The graph on the right 
is a focused macro view to observe the rewards collected 
by  the  agent  during  the  simulation  of  the  last  100 
episodes. The graph shows that in this period the DDPG 
agent  has  substantially  and  adequately  learned  the 
Quadfly  task.  During  the  1000  episodes  of  the  task,  the 
agent earned a reward that varies within a stable range of 
roughly between -20 and -50. This fact indicates that the 
DDPG  agent  has  been  able  to  very  well  learn  through 
rewards  in  1000  episodes.  Fig.  5  represents  the  same 
reward  collection  metrics  for  the  same  Quadfly  task  by 
the  ARS-Quad  agent.  The  graph  on  the  right  in  Fig.  5, 
represents that the agent was able to continuously earn an 
average reward which is between -10 and -40 which is

quadcopter  at  each  timestep  for  randomly  chosen  4 
episodes  from  the  final  100  episodes  of  the  simulation, 
which  typically  is  the  period  when  the  two  agents  have 
decently  and  adequately  learned  the  Quadfly  task.  The 
graphs  show  that  the  agent  begins  each  episode  at 
(0.,0.,10.0)  and  as  the  timestep  progresses,  the  agent  
starts  to  drift  downwards  to  a  height  of  0  while  also 
experiencing some drift away from the center (0,0) of the 
x-y  plane.  The  graph  depicts  the  ARS-agent  keeps  itself 
stable at a height of 10, and centered over the center (0,0) 
of the x-y plane.

Our  simulations  dispels  the  belief  of  model-based  RL 
always  exhibiting  superior  performance  than  model-free 
strategies  for  continuous  control  tasks  like  flying  of  a 
quadcopter. The simulations show that ARS-Quad reacts 
relatively accurately to step response per episode and the 
agent exhibits significant and better sample complexity in 
the  task  of  flying.  The  computational  benefits  of  not 
making  high-level  decisions  using  well  trained  neural 
networks are utilized by the ARS-Quad agent to learn the 
goal relatively accurately and at a faster pace. 

V.  CONCLUSION 

This research work presented a deterministic policy for 
the  control  of  quadcopter  which  is  one  of  the  major 
continuous  control  problems  reinforcement  learning  is 
trying to solve. While most of the previous work focuses 
on  solving  such  problems  of  autonomous  control  using 
well-trained  neural  networks  which  require  a  lot  of 
training data for state-of-the-art results. The present work 
eliminates  this  demand  of  data  through  a  random  search 
in  the  space  of  policies  and  achieves  state-of-the-art 
accuracy for the task of flying the quadcopter. The work 
demonstrates through simulations how the random search 
strategy  differ  in  performance  from  other  competitive 
reinforcement  learning  strategies  for  quadcopter  control. 
It  indicates  that  the  proposed  algorithm  is  conservative 
but  stable  for  the  task  of  quadcopter  control.  The 
simulations for the DDPG and ARS-Quad agent behavior 
were carried out for 1000 episodes with randomized seed 
and noise values and it was observed that the ARS-agent 
was  able  to  learn  the  goal  relatively  accurately  and  at  a 
faster  pace.  Also,  it  was  observed  that  though  the  ARS- 
Quad  agent  had  sudden  average  reward  dips  for  the  last 
100  episodes  unlike  DDPG  agent,  it  was  continuously 
able to earn an average reward which was better than that 
earned by the DDPG agent. Further, the simulations also 
show  the  quadcopter  flying  from  the  source  position  to 
the target position after keeping itself stable at a height of 
10m  above  ground  level  with  a  smooth  and  traceable 
trajectory. Overall, the proposed searching strategy shows 
a  better  sample  complexity  in  the  parameter  space  of 
policies than the RL strategies that majorly work by

The  present  work  creates  abundant  room  for  further 
progress  which  can  be  taken  into  consideration  in  future 
investigations.  Future  works 
the 
establishment  of  simple  baseline  methods  of  random 
search  before  moving  to  complex  methods  of  policy 
exploration. The present work is a use case of the random 
search  application  for  autonomous  control.  In  addition, 
the  use  of  the  proposed  algorithm  for  adapting  and 
learning in environments with dynamic properties can be 
addressed. Another line of future work can be the use of a 
game-theoretic  leader-follower  equilibria  approach  for 
quadcopter control. The long term goal for the extension 
of  the  work  can  be  the  comparison  of  the  proposed 
algorithm  with  other  state-of-the-art  RL  algorithms  for 
autonomous control.
