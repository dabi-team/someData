ABSTRACT

Context.
Aims. We aim to ascertain the physical parameters of a propagating wave over the solar disk detected by the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS).
Methods. Using imaging data from the IRIS and the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO), we tracked bright spots to determine the
parameters of a propagating transverse wave in active region (AR) loops triggered by activation of a ﬁlament. Deriving the Doppler
velocity of Si IV line from spectral observations of IRIS, we have determined the rotating directions of active region loops which are
relevant to the wave.
Results. On 2015 December 19, a ﬁlament was located on the polarity inversion line of the NOAA AR 12470. The ﬁlament was
activated and then caused a C1.1 two-ribbon ﬂare. Between the ﬂare ribbons, two rotation motions of a set of bright loops were
observed to appear in turn with opposite directions. Following the end of the second rotation, a propagating wave and an associated
transverse oscillation were detected in these bright loops. In 1400 Å channel, there was bright material ﬂowing along the loops in a
wave-like manner, with a period of
880 km. For the transverse oscillation, we tracked a given loop
and determine the transverse positions of the tracking loop in a limited longitudinal range. In both of 1400 Å and 171 Å channels,
approximately four periods are distinguished during the transverse oscillation. The mean period of the oscillation is estimated as
143
s and the displacement amplitude as between
690 km. We interpret these oscillations as a propagating kink wave and
obtain its speed of
Conclusions. Our observations reveal that a ﬂare associated with ﬁlament activation could trigger a kink propagating wave in active
region loops over the solar disk.

1. Introduction

The solar corona consists of ionized plasma with a temperature
of millions of kelvins, about three orders of magnitude higher
than the temperature of the visible solar surface (Erdélyi & Fe-
dun 2007). The heating process that generates and sustains the
hot corona is still an unresolved problem in solar physics. It
is believed that the subphotospheric convection zone supplies
enough kinetic energy to the corona, where suﬃcient energy may
be dissipated resulting in the heating of coronal plasma. Parker
(1988) put forward that the magnetic reconnection of neighbor-
ing stressed ﬁeld lines with opposite polarity vector components
would release magnetic energy violently and contributes to heat-
ing the corona. This idea was followed by a large number of stud-
ies (Solanki et al. 2003; Klimchuk 2006; Bradshaw & Klimchuk
2015; Wright et al. 2017). A possible scenario of energy trans-
porting from the convection zone to the corona is that the con-
vection below the solar visible surface and solar global oscilla-
tions may produce magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in the
photosphere, which then propagate upward into the corona car-
rying energy (Alfvén 1947; Parker 1958; De Pontieu et al. 2007;
Tomczyk et al. 2007; Antolin et al. 2017). In uniform plasmas,
there are three basic types of MHD waves: slow and fast magne-
toacoustic waves, and Alfvén waves. According to the frequen-

cies observed by solar instruments, MHD modes in cylindrical
plasma structures could be mainly grouped into four categories:
kink, sausage, longitudinal, and torsional (Van Doorsselaere et
al. 2008a). The ﬁrst three modes are magnetoacoustic and hence
compressible while the last one is the incompressible Alfvén
mode.

With the progress in the spatial and temporary resolution
of solar observation instruments, abundant evidence of various
types of MHD waves (standing and propagating waves) have
been detected in various solar activities. Propagating and stand-
ing transverse waves have been observed in spicules (He et al.
2009; Zaqarashvili & Erdélyi 2009; Okamoto & De Pontieu
2011; Pereira et al. 2016), in active region (AR) ﬁbrils (Pietar-
ila et al. 2011; Jafarzadeh et al. 2017), in mottles (Kuridze et al.
2012, 2013), in ﬁlament threads (Lin et al. 2007; Terradas et al.
2008; Li & Zhang 2012; Shen et al. 2014), and in coronal loops
(Ofman & Wang 2008; Tian et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2015; Li et al.
2017). Most of these events could be explained as the magnetic
ﬂux tubes being perturbed by an external excitation, and this per-
turbation appears as transverse oscillation and propagates along
the ﬂux tube, which is usually detected as a temporal variation
of the magnetic tube position or the Doppler velocity (Oliver et
al. 2014).

while the white arrows in panels (c) and (e) approximate the trajectory of the ﬁlament material ﬂows. The red dotted lines in panel (e) indicate the
ﬂare loops with shear in high temperature. An animation (1.mpg) of the 131 Å and 304 Å images is available online.

In recent years, the new-generation satellites such as Solar
Dynamic Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) and Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS; De Pontieu et al. 2014)
have provided observations that have high tempo-spatial reso-
lution ranging from the photosphere, chromosphere, and transi-
tion region to corona. Although there have been many studies of
MHD waves in the last few decades, observations about the prop-
agating wave taken by the IRIS are rarely reported (Okamoto et
al. 2015). Over the solar disk, there are only a few published
results of chromospheric waves from the IRIS data (Bryans et
al. 2016; Kanoh et al. 2016). One important reason is that there
are so many ﬁne structures in the chromosphere, thus making it
diﬃcult to detect the wave signal in a particular chromospheric
structure among the abundant features. By checking two years
of IRIS data (from June 2014 to May 2016), we ﬁnd an exam-
ple of a wave-oscillation event over the disk on 2015 Decem-
ber 19. This event enables us to examine the photospheric mag-
netic ﬁeld environment. In present paper, we report on the wave-
oscillation event in active region loops triggered by ﬁlament ac-
tivation which results in the storing and releasing of twist in the
loops.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section
2 contains the observations and data analysis taken in our study.
The observations of the ﬁlament activation, ﬂare eruption, rota-
tion motions, and the subsequent propagating transverse wave
in the loops are presented in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4 we
conclude this work and discuss the results.

2. Observations and data analysis

On 2015 December 19, the IRIS was pointed at NOAA AR
12470 from 16:41:13 UT to 17:37:33 UT, with the central co-
ordinate of (152′′, 302′′). We hence obtained a series of slit-jaw
1400 Å images (SJIs) with a cadence of 13 s, a pixel scale of
175′′. The 1400 Å
0.′′333, and a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 167′′ ×
channel contains emission from the Si IV 1394/1403 Å lines that
are formed in the lower transition region, which include the con-
tributions from continuum that is formed in lower chromosphere
as well. The employed data are all level 2, which have applied
dark current subtraction, ﬂat ﬁeld, geometrical, and orbital vari-
ation corrections (De Pontieu et al. 2014). For the spectroscopic
analysis, we mainly adopted the Si IV 1402.77 Å line which
is formed in the middle transition region with a temperature of
about 104.9 K (Li et al. 2014; Tian et al. 2014). The spectral data
were taken in a large sit-and-stare mode with a step cadence of
3.2 s. As the Si IV proﬁles were relatively close to a single Gaus-
sian, we used single-Gaussian ﬁts to approximate the 1402.77 Å
line (Peter et al. 2014).

The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al.
2012) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou
et al. 2012) observations from the SDO were also used. The
AIA continuously observes the multilayered solar atmosphere,
including the photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and
corona, in ten (E)UV passbands with a cadence of 12 s and a
spatial resolution of 1.′′2. The observations of 304 Å, 171 Å,
and 131 Å on 2015 December 19 were employed in the present
work. We also applied the corresponding full-disk line of sight
(LOS) magnetograms from the HMI, with a cadence of 45 s and

a pixel size of 0.′′5. Using the standard routine “hmi_prep” in
Solar Software package, we calibrated the AIA and HMI data
to a speciﬁed pointing, rescaled the images to a spatial resolu-
tion of 1.′′2, and de-rotated these images (removing the roll an-
gle) so that the solar east-west and north-south axes were aligned
with the horizontal and vertical axes of the image, respectively.
Then these data were all de-rotated diﬀerently to a reference time
(16:41:13 UT, the start time of the IRIS observations). The IRIS
observations were also all de-rotated to the same time. Finally,
we aligned the IRIS data with the SDO observations according
to speciﬁc features such as bright spots and loops which were
observed by both the IRIS and SDO.

3. Results

3.1. Activation of a ﬁlament and onset of the subsequent

ﬂare

On 2015 December 19, NOAA AR 12470 was located near the
solar disk-center. Around the main sunspot of this AR, a C1.1
ﬂare with two ribbons took place near 17:00 UT, which was
caused by a ﬁlament’s activation (see animation 1.mpg). Plenty
of ﬁlament material was brightened and then displayed diﬀerent
dynamic evolutions. Partial bright material moved along the ﬁl-
ament’s axis and slipped away. However, some other bright ma-
terial interacted with the active region loops which overlaid the
ﬁlament. These loops were disturbed by the ﬁlament material
and underwent twice rotating motions from 17:09 UT to 17:26
UT. Subsequently, a propagating wave and the associated trans-
verse oscillation were detected. Figure 1 shows the overview of

the area of interest, the process of the ﬁlament’s activation, and
the ﬂare’s onset in AIA 304 Å and 131 Å channels. The AR’s
main sunspot with negative polarity was surrounded by positive
ﬁelds. And a ﬁlament lied on the polarity inversion line (PIL)
of this AR (see panel (a)). The C1.1 ﬂare started at 16:58 UT,
and at the onset of the ﬂare, the brightening of the western foot-
points of the ﬂare loops gradually propagated toward the south-
west (see panel (b)), which developed into the western ﬂare rib-
bon above positive magnetic ﬁelds. The eastern ﬂare ribbon of
this ﬂare was located in the sunspot umbra with strong negative
ﬁeld (panel (d)). Between these two ribbons, the ﬂare loops with
evident shear appeared in 131 Å channel (see panel (e)), which
is dominated by the emission from Fe XXI line [log T
7.05]
(O’Dwyer et al. 2010). Meanwhile, the activated ﬁlament mate-
rial was detected to ﬂow from the north-east to the south-west
1 (see panel (c)). Another
with a projected speed of
90 km s−
ﬂow was observed along the ﬂare loops, which fell down in the
sunspot umbra (see panel (e)). This ﬂare increased to its maxi-
mum at 17:10 UT and faded away in the following ten minutes
(see the GOES ﬂux curve in the bottom of panel (a)).

3.2. Rotationsof active region loops

Following the ﬂare loops’ appearance, two rotation motions
were observed in the loops connecting negative-polarity sunspot
with northwestern positive ﬁelds (see animation 2.mpg). Around
17:09 UT, the peak of the ﬂare, a set of bright loops appeared in
1400 Å images (see Figure 2(a)). Then the ﬁrst rotation motion
took place during these loops, lasting from 17:09 UT to 17:15

UT. Examining the AIA 304 Å and 131 Å observations (see
animation 1.mpg), we noticed that some bright material which
came from the activated ﬁlament moved in the rotating loops.
We chose one bright spot which is relatively isolated in 1400 Å
channel and determine the positions of the tracked spot at dif-
ferent times (see panel (b)). Looking from left to right along the
rotation axis, the bright spot rotated about the axis anticlockwise.
To conﬁrm this rotation motion, we employ the IRIS spectra data
for Doppler velocity measurement. Panel (c) shows the Si IV
1402.77 Å line spectra along the slit. The positions at which
the rotating loops cross the slit are indicated by red and blue
plus symbols in the ﬁgure. The spectra proﬁles and Gaussian
ﬁts of these two positions are shown in panel (d). Here we get
the Gaussian ﬁt to the Si IV proﬁles by computing a non-linear
least-squares ﬁt to function f(x) with six parameters. The func-
tion f(x) is a linear combination of a Gaussian and a quadratic:
z2
2 + A3 + A4x + A5x2, where z = x
f (x) = A0e −
. The six param-
eters represent the height of the Gaussian (A0), the center of the
Gaussian (A1), the width of the Gaussian (A2), the constant term
(A3), the linear term (A4), and the quadratic term (A5), respec-
tively. Meanwhile, one-sigma error estimates of the six returned
parameters are also given. As a result, we calculate the uncer-
tainty of the Doppler velocity according to the one-sigma error
estimate of the center of the Gaussian (A1) (Li et al. 2016). At
17:10:07 UT, the Doppler velocities at blue and red plus posi-
tions are respectively –24.9
±
1 (redshift). The pair of blueshift and redshift signals
0.5 km s−
provide a strong evidence for the rotation motion. Undergoing
this rotation, a set of loops moved northward and reached the
northernmost point around 17:21 UT. Then, from 17:21 UT to
17:24 UT, the second rotation motion of these loops was detected
again. But this time, the rotation was clockwise if one looks from
left to right along the rotation shaft (see panel (f)). The spectral
data at 17:23:56 UT were taken to investigate the second rotation
motion. Through similar analysis method mentioned above, we
estimate the Doppler velocities at the positions indicated in the
1 (panel (h)),
1 and 53.4
ﬁgure as 11.9
respectively.

3.3. A propagatingwave with transverse oscillationin the

loops

The loops undergoing two rotation motions were clearly ob-
served in 171 Å passband too (see Figure 3(a)). Comparing the
171 Å images with HMI magnetograms, we can determine that
the loops originated from the main sunspot with negative polar-
ity and connected to the northwestern region with positive ﬁelds
(see panel (b)). At the later phase of the second rotation, several
bright spots moved in a wave-like manner from left to right along
the active region loops. We chose one distinct bright spot (with
the maximum brightness within the target region) at 17:24:57
UT in 1400 Å channel. We tracked this spot and determined
the coordinates of the spot frame-by-frame from 17:24:57 UT to
17:32:23 UT (see animation 3.mpg). After repeating the tracking
process for ten times, we obtained ten groups of the spot’s coor-
dinates at each frame. Then, we got the average values of the
spot’s coordinates at each frame and took the standard deviation
as the uncertainty. At about 17:25 UT, this bright spot moved
along these loops toward the west with a mean projected veloc-
1 (see panel (c)) and moved back to the
ity of 66.2
±
east after 17:29 UT with an average projected velocity of 12.7
1 (see panel (d)). The positions of the tracked fea-

Also accompanying the second rotation, several bright loops
tracked by the bright material display regular transverse oscilla-
tion. To investigate the transverse oscillation of these loops, we
tracked a given loop from 17:21:58 UT to 17:31:19 UT. A bright
spot inside this oscillating loop was tracked in a limited longi-
tudinal range (15′′). We determined the coordinates of this spot
at each frame in 1400 Å passband with the same method used in
Figure 3. We then got the average values of the spot coordinates
at diﬀerent frames and their standard deviations. Figure 4 shows
the mean transverse oscillation in 1400 Å images (see animation

Fig. 5. Similar to Figure 4, but in a higher temperature of the 171 Å
channel. The red curve are the duplications of Figure 4(e).

der the reminder of the IRIS observations, we noticed that the
oscillation motion could be detected in a higher temperature. We
applied the 171 Å data (see Figure 5) and analyzed them in the
same way as for the 1400 Å channel. The oscillation is visible
also for four periods, and the oscillation parameters, such as pe-
riod, amplitude, and velocity, are nearly the same as those in the
1400 Å bandpass (see Figure 5(e)). We ﬁtted the temporal evo-
lution of the oscillation with a damped sine function described
in Nakariakov et al. (1999) and obtained the decay time of
500
s.

Employing the high-resolution observations from the IRIS and
the SDO, we report a propagating wave in active region loops,
which is triggered by ﬁlament activation. On 2015 December
19, a ﬁlament lay on the PIL of the NOAA AR 12470, which
was activated and caused a C1.1 ﬂare. Between the ﬂare ribbons,
a set of bright loops were detected to ﬁrst rotate anticlockwise
and then rotate clockwise. Following the end of the clockwise
rotation, a propagating wave and an associated transverse oscil-
lation were detected in the loops. In the 1400 Å channel, there
was bright material moving toward the west along the loops with
1 at ﬁrst. Then, some bright
a mean velocity of 66.2
1.1 km s−
material moved back to the east with a mean velocity of 12.7
1. To investigate the transverse oscillation of these
±
loops, we tracked a given loop and determined the transverse po-
sitions of the tracking loop in a limited longitudinal range (15′′).
In both of 1400 Å and 171 Å channels, about four periods are
distinguished during the transverse oscillation. The period of the
oscillation is estimated as
143 s, but the amplitude decreases
from 1370

140 km.
In the chromosphere, only a few examples have been re-
ported of waves or oscillations detected in ﬁne structures over the
disk. High resolution Hα ﬁltergrams obtained with the Swedish
Solar Telescope resolved evidence for small amplitude (1 – 2
1) waves propagating along a number of on-disk ﬁlament
km s−
threads. The oscillatory period of individual threads vary from
three to nine minutes (Lin et al. 2007). Observations of Ca II
8542 Å revealed a kink wave in an on-disk chromospheric ac-
tive region ﬁbril, and the properties of the wave were similar to
those observed in oﬀ-limb spicules (Pietarila et al. 2011). Kanoh
et al. (2016) employed simultaneous Hinode (Kosugi et al.2007)
and IRIS observations of a sunspot umbra to derive the upward
energy ﬂux at photosphere and lower transition region and esti-
mate the energy dissipation. Temporal evolutions of the Doppler
velocity, the magnetic ﬂux density, and the line core intensity
derived from Hinode/SP data were applied to determine the pe-
riodic oscillating features at photosphere. Moreover, the Doppler
velocities derived from IRIS Mg II K and Si IV lines were used
to detect the oscillations at the chromosphere and the lower tran-
sition region. They concluded that standing slow-mode waves
are dominant at the photosphere, and the high-frequency leak-
age of the slow-mode waves is observed as upward waves at
the chromosphere and the lower transition region. Bryans et al.
(2016) reported strong recurring upward propagating ﬂows ob-
1
served by SOD/AIA with apparent speeds of 100 - 120 km s−
at coronal loop footpoints. Furthermore, magnetoacoustic shock
waves were detected by IRIS Mg IIh line. These observations
illustrated that both shock waves and ﬂows are involved at the
footpoints. Diﬀerent from previous works, here we ﬁrst report
a propagating wave with an associated transverse oscillation in
active region loops, which is triggered by ﬁlament activation. In
SDO/AIA 171 Å and IRIS 1400 Å channels, there is bright mate-
rial moving along the loops with a wave-like shape. Meanwhile,
the loops display transverse oscillation.

Before the detection of the propagating wave, we observed
two rotation motions in the bright loops. The ﬁrst rotation ap-
peared between the two ﬂare ribbons just at the peak of the ﬂare
around 17:10 UT. In the 1400 Å observation, the bright material
in the rotating loops is rotated anticlockwise if one looks from
left to right along the rotation axis. To check this anticlockwise
rotation, we analyzed the Si IV 1402.77 Å line spectra along the
slit which crosses the rotating loops. The spectral proﬁles in po-
sitions where the rotating loops cross the slit are approximated

by single-Gaussian ﬁts. Here we can imagine that there existed
a tube, and the bright loops wound round this tube. Since the
Doppler velocity in the lower position (blue plus) of the slit is
1 (blueshift) while that in upper position (red
–24.9
±
1 (redshift), we suggest that the red plus
plus) is 31.2
is located in upper side of the tube while the blue plus is located
in the lower side and this rotation is anticlockwise when look-
ing from left to right. Subsequently, the loops moved northward
and reached the northernmost point around 17:21 UT. They then
performed the second rotation motion - clockwise when look-
ing form left to right along the rotation axis. Similar to the ﬁrst
rotation, we chose two positions along the slit for spectral analy-
sis. The Doppler velocity in the upper position of the slit is 11.9
1 (redshift) and that in lower position is 53.4
1.5
±
1 (redshift). The same signal of Doppler velocity means
km s−
that these two positions are located in the same side of this tube.
Combing the fact that the redshift velocity of the lower position
is bigger than that in the upper position, we propose that both of
the two positions are located in the lower side of the tube and this
rotation is clockwise when looking from left to right. Since the
two rotation motions of these loops were in opposite directions,
combining the fact that the ﬁrst rotation appeared just when the
ﬂare peaked and the second rotation resulted in the appearance
of a propagating wave, we propose that the energy released by
the ﬂare twisted the bright loops and was stored as non-potential
magnetic energy in the twisted loops during the ﬁrst rotation mo-
tion. Then in the second rotation, the stored energy was released
by the unwinding motion of the twisted magnetic loops (Yan et
al. 2014), leading to a transverse wave propagating along these
loops.

Waves and oscillations can be detected either by imaging or
spectroscopic observations in solar limb (Papushev & Salakhut-
dinov 1994; Zaqarashvili et al. 2007; De Pontieu et al. 2007; He
et al. 2009). On the solar disk, quasi-periodic propagating distur-
bances have been found in large coronal loops (e.g., Nakariakov
et al. 1999; Nightingale et al. 1999; Berghmans & Clette 1999;
Aschwanden 2009; Ruderman & Erdélyi 2009). The propagation
of kink waves may lead to the observed periodic transverse dis-
placement of the loop axis. When the velocity of the kink wave
is polarized in the plane of observation, the spectral observation
shows obvious Doppler shift in the location of oscillating loop.
But if the velocity is polarized in the perpendicular plane, the vis-
ible displacement of the loop could be detected by the imaging
observation. Since the observations in our study display propa-
gating displacements of the active region loops in the 1400 Å
and 171 Å channels, we interpret these oscillations as a propa-
gating kink wave. This explanation is consistent with the reports
of low amplitude kink oscillations in the solar corona (Tomczyk
et al. 2007; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2008b). To estimate the den-
sity of the magnetic ﬁeld in a fundamental kink oscillating loop,
we applied the formula B = 2L
P pµmpmm(nin + nex)/2 (Roberts
et al. 1984; Aschwanden & Schrijver 2011). The P is the period
of oscillation, L is the length of the loop, µ is the magnetic per-
meability, mm is the molecular weight, mp is the proton mass, nin
and nex are the number densities of the proton inside and out-
143 s, µ=4π,
side of the loop. We estimate that L

& Verwichte 2012). The decay of the loop oscillation amplitude
indicates the dissipation of the wave energy, which contributes
to the heating of the loops. To estimate the energy ﬂux of the
wave, we applied the formula Ew = ρ(ν)2VA, where ρ is the
mass density, ν is the velocity amplitude, and VA is the Alfvén
speed (Tomczyk et al. 2007). The mass density was estimated

selaere et al. 2008b; Verwichte et al. 2013). We measured that
the maximum displacement amplitude (Amax) is
1370 km and

143 s. Then the
the oscillation period (P) has a mean value of
maximum velocity amplitude (νmax) is estimated to be
60 km

taken as the maximum velocity amplitude (νmax). The estimated
energy can balance typical radiative and conductive losses of the
loops and heat them to coronal temperature (Withbroe & Noyes
1977; Ofman & Wang 2008). However, the event reported here
is a special event triggered by a ﬂare associated with ﬁlament
activation. As a result, the mechanism in this event may not be
responsible for heating of all the coronal loops.
