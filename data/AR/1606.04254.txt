ABSTRACT: In this paper we describe the performance of a light detector for Ar scintillation
light made of wavelength-shifting (WLS) ﬁbers connected to Silicon-Photomultipliers (SiPM). The
setup was conceived to be used as anti-Compton veto for high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors
operated directly in liquid Argon (LAr). Background suppression efﬁciencies for different radioac-
tive sources were measured in a test cryostat with about 800 kg LAr. This work was part of the
R&D effort for the GERDA experiment.

1. Introduction

Presently there is a growing global demand for LAr scintillation light read-out on the ﬁeld of dark
matter and high energy neutrino beam experiments. [12], [1],[5]. In this paper we present a solution
that uses commercial products and is suited for low background experiments.

Although PMT technology made a signiﬁcant improvement recently the low temperature and
the low radioactivity requirement of some experiments is still posing a problem. A possible al-
ternative to PMTs operated in the cryoliquid are wavelength-shifting (WLS) ﬁbers that collect the
light and guide it to a Photo-Multiplier (PMT) outside the volume. An example of such a setup can
be found in [6].

Alternatively one can place the photon detector in the cryo-liquid. For such application a low
radioactivity detector is needed that works reliably at low temperatures. The best candidate to
date is the Silicon-Photomultipliers (SiPM) that is known to work at low temperature and because

it’s small size it could easily satisfy the radioactivity requirements. The typically few mm2 active
surface of the SiPM naturally suggests an application with WLS ﬁbers.

Our ﬁrst attempt to build such a detector for LAr scintillation light with WLS ﬁbers and SiPMs
was described in [8]. The setup described in this paper is a scaled up and improved version. It is
also new that the setup was realised without reﬂector foil only with WLS ﬁber allowing for a much
larger instrumented LAr volume.

2. Experimental setup

The experiments described in this paper were conducted in the underground laboratory of the TUM
in Garching (Germany). The laboratory building was planed to provide infrastructure for several
cryogenic and low background experiments and it has a soil overburden of 10 m water equivalent.

2.1 Test stand

In the underground laboratory is a test cryostat with a capacity of about 600 l of LAr. The cryostat
has an internal diameter of 700 mm and the liquid level is at about 1.5 m from the bottom allowing
the submersion of 1 m high objects. The schematic drawing of the cryostat is shown in Fig.1.

The LAr is actively cooled with liquid nitrogen. During the experiments described here and

previous tests we achieved stable operation of several month without the need to reﬁll LAr.

The cryostat is equipped with an air tight lock similar to the one used in the GERDA experiment
[9]. The lock permits lowering different setups in the LAr without contaminating it with air. The
largest object that can be inserted through the lock has a diameter of 240 mm and a height of one
meter.

The experimental setup described in Sec.3 is suspended with a steel band that is wind up on a
pulley actuated by an electric motor. Electrical connections are provided via vacuum feed troughs
located on the top of the lock. The signal transmission lines are realised with 50 Ω coaxial cables.

The steel band and the cables are long enough to reach the bottom of the cryostat even without
the detectors mounted. The total length of the signal cables from the detectors to the electronics
rack is about 20 m.

2.2 Liquid Argon

The LAr was delivered by the company Air Liquide and it was certiﬁed to be better than N50
quality.

The impurities in the LAr have an effect on the scintillation light yield affecting in ﬁrst place
the light emitted from the triplet state of the Ar excimer. Therefore the lifetime of the triplet state
is a good measure of the purity of the Argon. Fig.2 shows summed up PMT waveforms recorded
during our experiments. The ﬁtted exponential indicates a the triplet life time of around 1.4 µs
which is exceptionally good for such an experiment without active puriﬁcation of the Argon. The
literature value of the triplet life time is 1.6 µs [7]

in the cryostat (right).

constant (ﬂat background). The decay time of the exponential curve is about 1.4 µs.

2.3 Germanium detector

For the experiments described below we needed a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector that we
could operate directly in the LAr. The used detector was of BEGe (Broad Energy Germanium)
detector type from Canberra with only 50 g mass.

The HPGe detector was mounted in a self-made holder and it was suspended to hang at about
the middle of the setup described in Sec.3.5. Both the high-voltage and signal contacts were realised

used in GERDA [9]. During our experiments the energy resolution was about 3 keV FWHM at the
2.6 MeV line of 208Tl.

2.4 Radioactive sources

All low background experiments suffer from the presence of radioactive impurities in the surround-
ing materials usually dominated by isotopes from the Th and U decay chain. Therefore we tested
the response of our detector to 232Th and 226Ra sources. The purpose of the described experiments
was to demonstrate the background reduction potential of a similar setup in the GERDA experiment.
Since most of the radioactive sources at our disposition were not certiﬁed for use in cryo-
liquids we used thorated welding rods as a 232Th source. Commercially available tungsten welding
rods contain natural 232Th oxide up to 8 %. The measured activity of the 1 mm , 10 cm long
welding rod was about 20 Bq.

To simulate uranium chain contamination we used 226Ra source with about 30 Bq activity. This

source was a bare metal plate with Ra deposited on the surface, an open alpha and beta emitter.

The sources were suspended at about 1 cm below the HPGe detector.

3. Light instrumentation

The light detector described in this paper was designed with regard to the very speciﬁc requirements
of the GERDA experiment. These requirements are: low activity materials, low weight and sufﬁ-
ciently large instrumented volume for an effective anti-Compton veto. Another design constraint
was that the light instrumentation should be inserted in the cryostat together with the germanium
detectors hence the diameter is limited by the neck of the GERDA cryostat.

The major difference compared to the setup described in [8] that we omitted the reﬂector foil.
Instead we tried to achieve a closed volume using only WLS ﬁbers. With the ﬁbers arranged on
the perimeter of a cylinder it is possible to detect light also from outside of the cylinder increasing
the volume of the LAr compared to a setup delimited by reﬂector material. This way we can
compensate for the geometrical limitations of our lock which does not allow for an instrumented
volume with a radius larger than the radiation length of the LAr (14 cm). In GERDA the situation
is similar, there the distance from the HPGe detectors to the ﬁbers would be sub optimal for an
anti-Compton veto. This arrangement implies that the LAr volume is larger than the instrumented
volume.

Below we describe the components used in our setup and the way it was built.

3.1 WLS ﬁbers

Optical ﬁbers are usually made with round cross section. It is known that an optical ﬁber with
square cross section has a larger acceptance angle because of simple geometrical reasons. The
acceptance angle of the ﬁber which is proportional to the trapping efﬁciency for scintillating and
WLS ﬁbers is also affected by the cladding of the ﬁber. Fibers with two cladding layers with
decreasing refraction index from inside to outside have higher trapping efﬁciency than the more
common single clad ﬁbers.

– 4 –

For the highest possible trapping efﬁciency we chose to use square, multiclad ﬁbers from

Saint-Gobain.

The scintillation light of LAr (128 nm) is difﬁcult to detect directly therefore the VUV light is
shifted to blue ( 430 nm) by Tetraphenyl-butadiene (TPB). The TPB is applied as a coating on the
ﬁber.

The emission spectrum of the TPB was measured together with the absorption spectrum of the
WLS ﬁber with a Carry Eclipse ﬂuorimeter. From the two type of WLS ﬁbers offered by Saint-
Gobain it was found that the BCF-91A ﬁber matches better the emission spectrum of TPB (see
Fig.3). The graphical comparison of the two spectra shows that about 60% of the light emitted by
the TPB can be absorbed by the ﬁber.

Figure 3. Absorption spectrum of the BCF-91A ﬁber (solid line) and emission spectrum of the TPB (dashed
line).

The purchased ﬁbers were characterised for their optical properties. With the help of an LED
pulser and a SiPM we measured the attenuation length of the ﬁber. The measurement resulted
3.8 m which is consistent with the >3.5 m given by the manufacturer. To estimate the efﬁciency
of the ﬁber capturing blue light a piece of ﬁber was dissolved in toluene and we measured the
extinction coefﬁcient of the solution with a Perkin-Elmer UV-VIS spectrometer. The measured
result corresponds to an absorption length of the ﬁber of 0.7±0.001 mm for blue (400 nm) light.

3.2 Fiber modules

Since nine 1x1 mm2 ﬁbers cover perfectly the surface of a 3x3 mm2 SiPM the number ﬁbers in the
array should be multiple of nine. For easier handling we chose a modular design with units of 54
ﬁbers.

To achieve maximal coverage with minimum quantity of WLS ﬁber the square ﬁbers are ar-
ranged such that their diagonal lies on the circumference of the cylinder we want to enclose. Hence
the visible ﬁber surface facing the inner volume is 1.41 mm times the length of the ﬁber. To prevent
them turning, the ﬁbers are fed through a holder shown in Fig.4. This holder also ﬁxes the ﬁber
modules to the supporting structure.

At the lower end of the ﬁber module the ﬁbers are not cut but they are bent 180o to return in
the adjacent module. This way we don’t need light detectors or mirrors at the lower end of the
setup. All SiPMs are on the top and both ends of the ﬁbers are read-out.

– 5 –

 [nm]λ300350400450500550 I (a.u.)00.20.40.60.81The length of a ﬁber module is one meter. Because the ﬁbers turn back in the next module the
total length of a single ﬁber is slightly less then two meters. The losses because of the attenuation
in the ﬁber have the effect that we collect about 10% less light than if we would place SiPMs also
at the lower end of the module.

coupling to WLS ﬁbers, d) completed double ﬁber module on a mounting frame. Note the ﬁbers from one
module bent into the other.

3.3 TPB coating

One possibility to apply TPB coating on the ﬁbers is to dip them in a solution of TPB and polystyrene
dissolved in some organic solvent. This method was used in previous experiments to coat mirror
foil [2, 8]. The solvent of choice is usually toluene. It was noticed that the solvent damaged the
ﬁbers causing cracks in the cladding where the ﬁber was bent.

After some moderately successful experiments we abandoned the dip coating in favor of vac-
uum deposition. Vacuum deposition of TPB is done regularly on reﬂector materials and we adapted
the technology to WLS ﬁbers.

The ﬁber modules were coated with TPB in a vacuum chamber consisting of a 250 mm di-
ameter tube (Fig.5, left). Inside the tube we installed a heated crucible made of aluminium. The
crucible was closed on the top and had a slit machined on the side such that the TPB vapors could
exit only in the direction of the target. The picture in Fig.5 shows the crucible inside the vacuum
chamber mounted on a steel band. The steel band forms a closed loop stretched between two pul-
leys. By turning one of the wheels the crucible moves down and covers the full length of the ﬁber
module with TPB.

The most uniform deposition we achieved by heating the crucible to temperatures well below
the melting point of the TPB (203.5 oC). At 170 oC the deposition was reasonably fast and the
resulting TPB layer had satisfactory mechanical and optical properties.

The thickness of the deposited TPB was measured by evaporating it on glass plates. The
plates with TPB layer were scratched and we measured the depth of the scratch with a Tencor P-10
Surface Proﬁler.

For optical characterisation we evaporated TPB on acrylic plates exposing them for a different
time at the same temperature. The relative ﬂuorescence intensity of the exposed plates was mea-
sured with a Carry Eclipse ﬂuorimeter. The optical transmission of the same plates was measured
with a Perkin-Elmer UV-VIS spectrometer.

the crucible can be moved up and down by turning the pulley.

Based on the results of these measurement we chose to evaporate about 200 nm TPB on the
ﬁbers. At this thickness the scintillation light yield is already very high and the transmission of the
coating is still about 80%. Thicker TPB layers where white and opaque.

During the evaporation of the ﬁber modules the TPB thickness was monitored with glass plates
exposed together with the ﬁbers. The TPB thickness on the ﬁnal ﬁber modules was varying between
200 and 400 nm.

3.4 SiPM read out

SiPMs were extensively studied at low temperatures: [11, 10, 4, 8] The result of this studies was
always that SiPMs are a viable option at temperatures down to that of liquid nitrogen (LN). A
big advantage of using SiPMs at LN temperatures is that the dark rate decreases by 6-7 orders of
magnitudes to an almost negligible level. This fact allows us to consider SiPM arrays with an active
area of the order of cm2 for scintillation light read out in LAr.

For possible use in GERDA the radioactivity of commercial devices is a major concern because
of the substrate that is normal glass ﬁber circuit board material. To have the radio-purity issue under
control we decided to package the SiPMs by ourselves. Therefore we purchased the SiPMs in die
from Ketek GmbH. We used the 3 mm x 3 mm devices with 50 µm pixel size from Ketek with
product code PM3350.

Due to the temperature dependence of the ploy-silicon quenching resistor the recharge of the
pixel at low temperature is slower typically by an order of magnitude. The quenching resistor of
these devices increased from 360 kΩ to about 4 MΩ causing that the time needed to recharge a
pixel increased to about two µs.

The slow pulses do not have any drawback since the goal of the experiment is to detect a single

photo-electron in a time window of 5 to 10 µs.

– 7 –

As substrate for the packaging CuFlon, a Teﬂon based circuit board material was chosen (

CuFlon is a brand name of the Polyﬂon Company). This material is known for its low activity.

In a small board of 7 mm x 21 mm we had square holes machined for the SiPM chips. Such
a holder with the SiPMs already implanted is shown in Fig.4.b). Each holder has place for three
SiPMs. The top copper layer of the PCB material is divided in two strips during the milling to form
the two contacts of the SiPM array.

The SiPMs are placed in the holder and bonded to the copper stripes. Than the holder is
covered with a thin layer of transparent epoxy glue (Polytec EP601). The SiPM arrays are placed
in an oven heated to 40 oC for about 10 hours, until the glue is cured.

Each array was tested ﬁrst at room temperature than in LN. The arrays that passed the ﬁrst test
were assembled in double arrays of six SiPMs and tested again in LN. Only fully functional SiPM
arrays with low dark rate were assembled with the ﬁbers.

3.5 Detector array

The setup shown in Fig.1 (right) is a scaled down version of the setup built for GERDA. The
diameter of the cylindrical ﬁber array is 240 mm, about half of the 470 mm planed/built for GERDA
while the height is exactly the same, one meter.

The setup comprises seven ﬁber modules described in Sec.3.2 In the middle of cylinder we
installed the HPGe detector. The radioactive source was suspended just below the HPGe detector.
At the bottom part of the cylinder we mounted a PMT which was used only to measure the

triplet life time of the LAr shown in Fig.2.

3.6 Electronics and data acquisition

The HPGe detector was connected to a cryogenic ampliﬁer similar to the one described in [9]. On
the contrary SiPMs arrays were operated without active electronic components in the LAr cryostat.
The 6 SiPMs in parallel are connected directly to a 50 Ω coaxial cable which is used for applying
the bias voltage and for signal transmission. The ampliﬁers were outside the cryostat at room
temperature. A schematic drawing of the SiPM read-out is shown in Fig.6.

Figure 6. Circuit diagram of the SiPM read-out. Only one channel is shown with six SiPMs in parallel
which corresponds to an array of 54 mm2. The cable separating the SiPMs and the ampliﬁer is about 20 m
long. The charge ampliﬁer is a Cremat-112.

The HPGe signals and the seven SiPM channels, each corresponding to a ﬁber module, were
recorded separately with an eight channel Struck SIS3301 FADC. The data acquisition (DAQ) was

– 8 –

usually triggered by the HPGe channel and 40 µs traces were recorded with 100 MHz sampling
rate. To estimate the light yield (see Fig.8) in a separate measurement we triggered on any of the
SiPM channels. To record the data presented in Sec. 4.2.1 the sampling rate of the ADC was
reduced to 25 MHz and the trace length increased to the maximum allowed by the ADC.

3.7 Data analysis

The DAQ recorded the pulse shapes of each channel and the LAr veto was applied off-line. The
HPGe energy was calculated on-line by the Struck ADC ﬁrmware. The shaping time was set to 10
µs.

To ﬁnd the SiPM pulses in the recorded traces we used a trigger ﬁnding algorithm based on
the well known trapezoidal ﬁlter [13]. We applied the mowing window deconvolution two times on
the recorded traces. In the ﬁrst step the decay time of the ampliﬁer is deconvoluted (50 µs) and in
the second step the RC constant of the SiPM given by the quenching resistor times pixel capacity is
removed. On the resulting waveform we used a leading edge trigger ﬁnding algorithm to determine
the trigger time and we read the amplitude of the pulses after a ﬁxed delay following the trigger.
Fig. 7, left shows the original waveform and the derived waveforms and on the right the resulting
amplitude distribution.

The algorithm was implemented in the GELATIO framework [3] which is used to process the

GERDA data.

For the anti-Compton veto an event was vetoed if any of the SiPM channels was hit (at least
one trigger found) and the amplitude of the SiPM signal was at least 70% of the single pixel signal
amplitude. In all our experiments we used a coincidence window of 7 µs which is the time needed
to collect 99% of the LAr scintillation light with a triplet lifetime of 1.4 µs.

To produce the plot in Fig. 8 we summed up the amplitude of coincident SiPM pulses measured

with the trapezoidal ﬁlter.

signals after the second moving window deconvolution from one channel with 6, 3x3 mm2 SiPMs. The data

4.1 Photo-electron yield

To stay consistent with the literature we will give the light yield in number of photo-electrons (p.e.)
although since we are using SiPMs we always mean the number of SiPM pixels ﬁred.

First we lowered the setup in LAr with a built in 232Th source. In this measurement the DAQ

was triggering on any of the SiPM channels.

Each channel was calibrated in p.e. than the channel amplitudes belonging to one event were
summed up. The resulting spectrum can be seen in Fig.8. Knowing that the highest energy line
in the Th spectrum is the 2.6 MeV gamma line from the decay of 208Tl, one can estimate the light
yield. In this case we obtained about 50 p.e./MeV.

Figure 8. 232Th spectrum recorded with the ﬁbers and SiPMs. The estimated light yield is about 50 p.e./MeV

4.2 Suppression factors

To test the performance of the ﬁbers as anti-Compton veto we mounted a 232Th source right below
the HPGe detector before lowering the whole setup in the LAr.

The resulting spectra can be seen in Fig.9. After applying the LAr veto cut the spectrum was
suppressed by a factor 177 in window of 200 keV around 2039 keV. In the right histogram of
Fig.9 on can see how the LAr veto brings to evidence the gamma lines hidden under the Compton-
continuum of the 2.6 MeV line of 208Tl. The blue ﬁlled histogram shows the spectrum of coincident
events. The coincident spectrum above 2 MeV is contains practically only the 2.6 MeV line, it’s
Compton-continuum, the single-escape and the double escape (DEP) peaks. The separation of the
DEP from the 228Ac line below is spectacular.

In another experiment we submerged the setup in the LAr together with a 226Ra source. The
226Ra source was an open alpha source by construction. An unknown fraction of the emitted alpha
and beta particles could exit in the LAr.

Applying the LAr veto as before we achieved a suppression of the 226Ra spectrum by a factor
of about 12 in the region of interest. The obtained suppression factors from both experiments are
sumarized in Table.1

In both experiments we estimated the probability of random coincidences between the light
read-out and the HPGe signal by triggering the DAQ with a pulser signal and measuring the sup-

pression of this trigger. In all our experiments we had a pulser acceptance rate above 90%. The rate
of random coincidences can be explained by the activity of our sources plus the activity of 39Ar in
the LAr and the cosmic muon rate.

4.2.1 BiPo-214 delayed coincidences

Scintillator detectors offer the possibility to use Bi-Po delayed coincidence for background identi-
ﬁcation.

Having an open alpha source we can try to observe the alpha decay of 214Po following a hit in

the HPGe detector induced by a 214Bi gamma photon.

Therefore we changed the DAQ settings to record 665 µs long traces with a sampling rate of
25 MHz. We recorded 20 µs baseline before the HPGe trigger and the 7 µs after the trigger was
used for the usual anti-Compton veto. The remaining trace length of 628 µs (3.8 214Po half-lives)
was used to search for alpha events.

We identiﬁed alpha events by requiring high multiplicity. We classiﬁed a group of triggers as
an alpha event when several SiPM channels ﬁred (at least 4 of 7 ) and the total number of p.e.s in
that event was above 20. This cut was optimised empirically in order to reduce the contamination
of the sample with gamma background events.

The number of such events is decreasing exponentially with a time constant that corresponds
to a half life of 164 µs (See Fig.10). Therefore we are convinced that with the above described
method we selected the alpha events originating from 214Po following the decay of 214Bi.

The observation of the alpha can be also used to suppress the 226Ra spectrum in the HPGe
detector. The measured suppression factor is only 1.3. We have to mention that we did not expected
much better suppression: with the given source geometry the alpha particles are emitted in the LAr
only in 50% of the cases which sets an upper limit to the expected suppression factor of 2. In
addition we don not know how many alphas actually exit the source without loosing too much
energy. Therefore the achieved suppression factor is reasonable and is still compatible with the
assumption that we can detect alphas with very high probability.

In theGERDA experiment the BiPo-214 trigger could be useful to reject background originating
from 222Rn that could be either dissolved in the LAr or sticking to the surface of detectors and

5. Conclusion

In this paper we showed that is possible to build an anti-Compton veto for HPGe detectors operated
in LAr using only WLS ﬁbers and SiPMs. We demonstrated that the performance of such a system
is very close to the one built with PMTs [2]. The differences in the measured suppression factors

was similar.

The 228Th source used in [2] had probably a higher beta emission probability. On the other
hand our 226Ra source emitted more betas than the one used in [2]. Apart from these differences the
suppression factors reported in this paper are compatible with the best results achieved elsewhere.
Another novelty in our setup compared to similar systems is the vacuum deposition of TPB on
WLS ﬁbers. We obtained a coating quality that is superior to the liquid solvent based coatings and
does not damage the WLS ﬁbers.

We also demonstrated that is possible to detect 214Bi - 214Po delayed coincidence with a 214Bi
gamma photon triggering the HPGe detector and the following 214Po alpha particle depositing
energy in the LAr. This could potentially provide further background reduction in experiments like
GERDA.
