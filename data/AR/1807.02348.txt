Data-driven causal path discovery without
prior knowledge - a benchmark study

July 18, 2018

Abstract

Causal discovery broadens the inference possibilities, as correlation does not in-
form about the relationship direction. The common approaches were proposed for
cases in which prior knowledge is desired, when the impact of a treatment/intervention
variable is discovered or to analyze time-related dependencies. In some practical ap-
plications, more universal techniques are needed and have already been presented.
Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the accuracies in determining causal
paths in a dataset without considering the ground truth and the contextual infor-
mation. This benchmark was performed on the database with cause-eﬀect pairs,
using a framework consisting of generalized correlations (GC), kernel regression gra-
dients (GR) and absolute residuals criteria (AR), along with causal additive modeling
(CAM). The best overall accuracy, 80%, was achieved for the (majority voting) com-
bination of GC, AR, and CAM, however, the most similar sensitivity and speciﬁcity
values were obtained for AR. Bootstrap simulation established the probability of
correct causal path determination (which pairs should remain indeterminate). The
mean accuracy was then improved to 83% for the selected subset of pairs. The de-
scribed approach can be used for preliminary dependence assessment, as an initial
step for commonly used causality assessment frameworks or for comparison with prior
assumptions.

Introduction

The standard Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient only provides information about the strength

of a linear relationship between two variables. It cannot be used to establish the direction

of the relation. However, in many economic and medical applications, the analysis and fur-

ther inference should be extended with information about the cause-and-eﬀect relationship

between the variables [Spirtes (2010)].

Time series data are usually analyzed with the Granger causality framework or its

generalizations and special extensions [Granger (1969); Chen et al. (2004)]. The main

concept is that a time-evolving variable X causes (in the Granger sense) another evolving

variable Y if predictions of Y based only on its own past values are worse than those also

considering past values of X. It is based on a meaningful and relatively obvious idea that

the cause should happen before its eﬀect. The improvement of prediction accuracy, in other

words, the increase of the determination coeﬃcient of a considered model, delivers speciﬁc

and unique information that is propagated to future values of the observed eﬀect variable.

However, this methodology is restricted to time-related data.

Time-independent, data-frame-related techniques are also introduced. Many of them

are based on graphical, structural, potential-outcome- or additive-noise-type approaches

[Pearl et al. (2009); Pearl (2010); Rubin (1974); Mooij et al. (2016); Sch¨olkopf et al. (2012)].

The ﬁrst major school, tied to the Neyman–Rubin causal model framework, utilizes po-

tential outcome analysis. The reasoning is that the result may depend on diﬀerent possi-

bilities/choices in the past, but only one has happened in reality. Initially, a randomized

experiment should be performed on equivalent groups to try to attribute an eﬀect based

on several speciﬁc causes [Neyman (1923)].

In many cases, such experiment cannot be

carried out due to, e.g., long time frames, requiring too much interference in the lives

of the study participants, or the possible unrecognizable inﬂuence of secondary variables.

Therefore, Rubin et al. proposed a non-random assignment mechanism in which any con-

sidered secondary variables are balanced within the groups created by analyzed variables.

The relation is then attributed by ﬁnding the diﬀerence between the eﬀects on various

interventions/treatments [Rubin (2005)].

Another school is connected with Pearl’s research on causality, which primarily uses

structural equation modeling (SEM) and its generalization from linear to nonparametric

models. He proposed a way of interpreting the equations from a causal and counterfac-

tual perspective [Pearl (2009)]. Furthermore, causal relations between the events can be

established as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is a Bayesian network - each node

can represent a state and each directed link has a probability measure, which describes the

possibility of a transition. For such DAGs, the do-calculus rules theorem was introduced to

analyze the eﬀects (including counterfactual outcomes) of an intervention, e.g., do(x), where

x is treated as an atomic intervention [Pearl (1995)]. However, the presented approach de-

sires prior knowledge: primarily, a preliminary directed acyclic graph may improve search

process [Spirtes et al. (2000)]. Such causal discovery search comprises many methods, e.g.,

fast causal inference, fast greedy equivalance and Bayesian network estimators [Chickering

(2002); Zhang (2006); Rebane and Pearl (2013); Zhang et al. (2017)].

On the other hand, it appears that in many physiological studies there is a search for

a more universal technique. Firstly, the basic medical knowledge cannot always identify

the cause, because the network of relationships might be bidirectional. Secondly, several

hypotheses may not be strictly related with interventional, but rather with general de-

scriptive variables, and they may try to describe generic, static relationships, e.g., between

two systems. In such situations, it could be relevant to discover the causal path in a data-

driven manner and only then relate the result to medical expectations. Using Bayesian-style

3

approaches might require much more data for the correct transition from prior to poste-

rior distribution and to produce proper inference, and that is not possible in every study.

Moreover, some applications do not apply treatment variables and counterfactual eﬀects.

Several approaches that fulﬁll these criteria were found. We ﬁnally chose the frameworks

elaborated by Vinod et al., comprising generalized correlations, kernel regressions and

stochastic dominance criteria, along with an algorithm for ﬁtting a causal additive model

(CAM) [Zheng et al. (2012); B¨uhlmann et al. (2014); Vinod (2017)].

Therefore, the aim of the study was to benchmark these methods with the data from

the cause-eﬀect pairs database [Mooij et al. (2016); Dheeru and Karra Taniskidou (2017)]

(available also from a causality contest, the Cause-Eﬀect Pairs Challenge, organized by

Kaggle [Kaggle (2013)]), by assessing the possibility of discovering a causal link with each

method separately and for several combinations, without stating prior knowledge on the

subject of the speciﬁc phenomenon.

2 Materials & Methods

A set of 108 ﬁles, each consisting of variables (usually two) describing various physical,

meteorological and economic cases, was shared. Pairs were removed from the list if the

single-input data were not in the form of a single vector, if no ground truth about the

causal variable was given or if the CAM algorithm reported a calculation error. Thus,

95 pairs were used for the benchmark study. The list of index numbers of the ﬁles taken

into consideration, along with short descriptions of every case and other information and

calculations, are provided in the supplementary materials (T1).

Four methods enabling time-invariant causal path discovery were elaborated; their short

descriptions are given below:

• (M1), a criterion based on minimizing local kernel regression gradients: if path X →

Y has smaller partial derivatives than the inverse model, it suggests the presented

direction; implemented by equation (1) below [Vinod (2017)];

• (M2), a criterion based on absolute values of residuals: if path X → Y has smaller

absolute residuals than the inverse model, it suggests the presented direction; imple-

mented by equation (2) below [Vinod (2017)];

• (M3), the asymmetric generalized correlations r∗

gests that y is more likely to be the ”kernel cause” of x; equation (3) below implements

The ﬁrst three methods can be utilized with the generalCorr package [Vinod et al.

(2018)], and the last, CAM, using the CAM package [Peters and Ernest (2015)]. For

clarity, no additional tuning and/or pruning was applied.

We analyzed all pairs using all algorithms and stored the results with the provided

ground truth. Then, we tried to assess the accuracies with confusion matrices. The combi-

nation of all results was tested with the majority voting technique (with the determination

of the leader). Next, the accuracies of all combinations of results from the three algorithms

were estimated in the same manner.

As the R package provided by Vinod enables the use of bootstrap analysis to determine

the certainty of causal path direction, we assessed the quality of causal paths discovery

in connection with the probability value, trying to ﬁnd the best value, above which the

highest accuracy of the causal direction indication is obtained, and below which the results

should be questioned and probably not used for the ﬁnal inference. Due to the fact that

this operation is relatively time-consuming, and that some pairs have many observations,

we decided to set the number of iterations to 10. We found that increasing the number to

20 or 50 does not change the ﬁnal ”p-cause” value signiﬁcantly.

Considering that causality is only sensible when at least a very small correlation is

present and statistically signiﬁcant (when the slope coeﬃcient of the linear model is some-

how important), we evaluated the accuracy when accepting only those cases that met two

threshold conditions:

• the absolute value of Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient is greater than 0.1, and

• the absolute value of the Bayesian correlation coeﬃcient is greater than 0.1 and

M F E > 0.9.

Finally, we analyzed the impact of the number of observations in each pair on the

6

accuracy by analyzing which number of observations maximizes balanced accuracy (the

mean of sensitivity and speciﬁcity), overall accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa.

All analysis was performed using R software, along with external packages [R Core

Team (2018)].

The summary of accuracies obtained for separate algorithms is presented in Table 1. All

of the considered approaches handle the data relatively poorly.

of ”p-cause”= 0.9 is optimal for setting the heuristic threshold above which results are

taken into account.

We analyzed the accuracies of the causal paths discoveries for the best combination of

algorithms and for those pairs for which ”p-cause” was at least 0.9 (70 pairs; approximately

73% of all results), and obtained an accuracy of about 83%, which is greater than that

obtained without analyzing ”p-cause”. Interestingly, taking into account only those pairs

for which ”p-cause”= 1 does not increase the accuracy further, but only reduces the number

of pairs included in the analysis (59 pairs; 62%). Taking only those cases where all methods

produced the same result (unanimity; 55.8% of results) actually reduces the accuracy. All

statistics are provided in Table 3.

The strength of the unanimity measure combined with the ”p-cause” parameter was

assessed. A boxplot comparing the distribution of ”p-cause” values is presented in Figure 2.

The results showed that the median value equals 1 for both cases. However, for ”unanimity”

cases, 75% of results exceed 0.9, the level we chose to declare sensible causal path, which

even say that a low number provides better accuracy. The maximum for balanced accuracy

and Cohen’s Kappa was found at 154, and at 724 for overall accuracy.

4 Discussion

In this paper, presented the results of a test of several methods intended for causal path

discovery without prior knowledge of the data pairs coming from diﬀerent ﬁelds of research.

The best accuracy was obtained for the combination of generalized correlations framework,

kernel regression absolute residuals criteria (AR) and causal additive modeling (CAM). All

results were provided for the entire dataset cases; we did not have to divide the data into a

training and test set (like in supervised learning approaches) because the analysis for each

pair was treated as an independent step.

Several other methods could be included here based on meeting the basic criteria. For

instance, mediation analysis and its extensions seem promising. However, it is relevant to

problems of three or more variables, whereas the presented benchmark focused on the most

elementary connections, within pairs. Still, the results from the analyzed framework could

also serve as the input consideration for mediation analysis.

Otherwise, as in the case of the machine learning approach, we are not directly depen-

dent on the training data, as well as on the consistency of the subsequent data used for

testing and validation.

In the contest report, it is stated that several baseline methods were utilized, e.g.,

additive-noise, latent variable or complexity-based models, as well as machine learning

methods. Various aspects were evaluated, e.g., dependency, confounding, causality and

ﬁnal score. However, in order to compare them with the metrics used in this study, only

causality seems relevant. Interestingly, such approaches gave slightly worse results, with

about 76% accuracy for real data as the best result. Several issues were also surveyed, e.g.,

preprocessing, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, classiﬁcation and time spent;

this seems far more sophisticated than the approach presented in the benchmark study

13

Draft under review in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE

[Guyon (2014)].

The presented approach demonstrates the possibility of establishing causal paths’ di-

rection based only on the data. We assume that this approach, when combined with in-

formation from experts, may enable universal assessment of causality. It seems impossible

to choose real causal explanations only by looking at observed data: such prior knowledge

would allow acquisition of causal information without performing interventions.

In the

study, the context is diﬀerent. We believe that for causal analysis, especially in data cases

for which bidirectional links are assumed as well as for small data sets, the results cannot

be very dependent on prior knowledge, but they can complement it generally.

On the other hand, it seems that the presented approach could complement time-series

analyses based on newer approaches and generalizations of Granger causality [Porta and

Faes (2016)]. We plan to connect such approaches and would also like to analyze the impact

of many parameters, which can be established through the CAM process.

4.1 Limitations

In the presented study, we did not analyze the distribution of data in each case, nor

the cross-associations between pairs. This is because the data comes from various ﬁelds

and such processing could not be coherent with the main objective. Still, the impact of

mentioned aspects should be addressed.

We wanted to focus on assessing elementary connections; as for the practical applica-

tions, the causal path for a set of more than two variables can be also established using the

presented combination of methods, though this was not analyzed.

Also, it turned out that it is reasonable to determine the direction of a relationship only

for data that fulﬁlls the bootstrap simulation criterion (”p-cause”>= 0.9); some results will

be questioned, although their proportion seems sensible. Admittedly, as ”p-cause” comes

14

Draft under review in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE

from bootstrap simulation, its value is not very stable, so the proposed criterion should be

viewed as as merely informative, not explicit.

5 Conclusion

In this benchmark study, an analysis of the accuracy of determining causal paths from

the data from a causality contest was presented with the premise that the ground truth

information is not taken into account for the discovery. The best overall accuracy was

achieved for a combination of three methods: generalized correlations framework, kernel

regression absolute residuals criteria (AR) and causal additive modeling (CAM). The most

similar sensitivity and speciﬁcity values were obtained for AR criterion.

We proposed to establish the causal path for about 73% of the considered pairs based on

the ”p-cause” criterion; the remaining cases are proposed to be left as indeterminate. The

correlation coeﬃcients and number of observations seemed to not aﬀect the result much.

In our opinion, the described approach can be used for preliminary dependence as-

sessment, as an initial step for the commonly used causality assessment methods, or for

comparison of data-driven ﬁndings with the ground truth.
