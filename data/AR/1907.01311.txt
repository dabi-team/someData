Marsh et al. detected radio and optical pulsations from the binary system AR Scorpii (AR Sco).
This system, with an orbital period of 3.56 h, is composed of a cool, low-mass star and a white

dwarf with a spin period of 1.95 min. Optical observations by Buckley et al. showed that the
40%) with pe-
polarimetric emission from the white dwarf is strongly linearly polarised ( up to
riodically changing intensities. This periodic non-thermal emission is thought to be powered by
108 G) white dwarf that is spinning down. The morphology of the po-

larisation signal, namely the position angle plotted against the phase angle, is similar to that seen

in many radio pulsars. In this paper we demonstrate that we can ﬁt the traditional pulsar rotating
vector model to the optical position angle. We used a Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo technique to
ﬁnd the best ﬁt for the model yielding a magnetic inclination angle of α = (86.6+3.0
2.8)◦ and an
observer angle of ζ = (60.5+5.3
6.1)◦. This modelling supports the scenario that the synchtrotron
emission originates above the polar caps of the white dwarf pulsar and that the latter is an orthog-

Polarisation modelling for the white dwarf pulsar AR Sco

L du Plessis1

1. Introduction

AR Sco is is a unique binary system, which has some similar properties to the propeller system,
AE Aquarii [1]. Marsh et al. [1] observed pulsating emission ranging from the radio to the X-ray
band. They found that the orbital period is 3.56 hours and the white dwarf pulsar’s spin period is
1 was observed [1], but the value of ˙P was
1.95 minutes. A change in period ( ˙P) of 3.9
10−
later questioned by Potter and Buckley [2], where Stiller et al. [3] found a revised ˙P of about twice
the reported value from Marsh et al. [1].
The aim of this paper is to show that the standard rotating vector model [4] can be used to model the
optical polarisation position angle of the white dwarf pulsar to constrain the origin of the emission.
For more details, see Du Plessis et al., in preparation.

1.1 Observations

The light curve from the right column of Figure 2 in Marsh et al. [1] shows a double peak with
a larger ﬁrst peak followed by a smaller second peak, with a separation of
180◦ in phase. This
could indicate that the magnetic inclination angle α is close to 90◦ since the observation shows
radiation from both poles. Buckley et al. [5] found the emission of AR Sco was strongly linearly
polarized (up to
40%) and observed a 180◦ swing in the polarisation position angle (PPA). Given
the lack of evidence for mass loss from the secondary or accretion [1], Buckley et al. [5] interpreted
the spin-down power loss as due to magnetic dipole radiation. AR Sco is thus the ﬁrst known white
dwarf pulsar, since it is pulsating with predominantly non-thermal emission, analogous to pulsating
neutron stars.

1.2 The Rotating Vector Model (RVM)

Pulsars are known to be rotating neutron stars with two radio emission cones located at the magnetic
poles. The inclination angle of the magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis is represented by
α, the observer’s line of sight by ζ, and the impact angle β = ζ
α. Using the RVM, the PPA ψ
is given by

−

tan(ψ

ψ0) =

−

sinζ cosα

sinαsin(φ

φ0)

−
cosζ sinαcos(φ

φ0)

,

(1.1)

−
with φ the sweeping (phase) angle. The parameters φ0 and ψ0 deﬁne a ﬁducial plane. The RVM
makes the following assumptions: a zero emission height, the emission is tangent to the local mag-
netic ﬁeld, the pulsar’s co-rotational speed at the emission altitude is non-relativistic, the emission
beams are circular, the magnetic ﬁeld is well approximated by a static vacuum dipole magnetic
ﬁeld, and the plane of polarisation is parallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld.

2. Method

2.1 Folding of Data

We used the PPA data from [5] obtained on 14 March 2016 in the 340
900 nm range. We
normalised the data to the spin period of the white dwarf by converting the time, which was in
Barycentric Julian Day (BJD), to seconds and dividing by the spin period. We then found the

−

minimum PPA of the dataset to deﬁne t0, which is the starting point used to fold the dataset. We
used a standard folding technique to convert to cyclic time. About 5% of the data points deviated
from the average curve because of a 180◦ ambiguity in the PPA. The folding was found to be
affected by the choice of t0. The problem was solved by generating a smoothed PPA curve using
the Kernel Density Estimation method and a Gaussian kernel e.g. Silverman [6]. Depending on the
deviation between the smoothed curve and the folded data, we assigned a new convention to the
points with a large deviation by shifting these points by 180◦ (since there is a 180◦ ambiguity in
PPA when deriving the RVM). We then binned the data to 30 rotational phase bins.

2.2 Fixing PPA Discontinuities

Using the RVM, Equation 1.1, causes the model to be discontinuous since the arctangent function
is discontinuous. To make the model continuous, we calculated where φ made the denominator of
Equation 1.1 go to zero:

φdiscontinuous = arccos

tanζ
tanα(cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

(2.1)

Using this equation, we shift the predicted PPA by 360◦ at the points where the model was discon-
tinuous for the different cases to get a smooth, continuous PPA prediction.

2.3 Code Veriﬁcation and Best Fit

We used the convention of Everett and Weisberg [7], letting ψ increase in the counter-clockwise
ψ. We then calibrated our model by comparing our best ﬁt
direction, where we deﬁne ψ′ =
against independent RVM ﬁts to radio pulsar data [7], and ﬁnding the same results within error
margins for α and ζ. The “best ﬁt” (50th percentile or median in the posterior distribution of ﬁt
parameters) was found using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo technique [8]. We ﬁt for cosα and
cosζ, since we are assuming that cosζ is uniformly distributed.

−

3. Results

We found that we can model the white dwarf pulsar using the traditional RVM model. When we
found the best ﬁt using the angles directly, it led to disconnected contours in parameter space. We
then found the best ﬁt using the cosine of the angles. We found a unique ﬁt for the RVM to the PPA
data, namely α = 86.6+3.0
6.0. The large duty cycle leads to relatively small errors
on α and ζ. The red curve in Figure 3 shows the best ﬁt and the yellow curves are the “error band”
derived from the best ﬁt parameters. We also found a best ﬁt with an added likelihood parameter
f , which compensates for errors underestimated by some fraction f .

4. Discussion

We found α
the white dwarf could be modelled by the RVM this could mean that the emission of the AR Sco
system originates from the magnetic poles of the white dwarf. In the future we want to ﬁt the
RVM to PPA data in other energy bands, and for different orbital phases. We will also compare our
modelling to the work of Potter and Buckley (in preparation). We furthermore want to incorporate
a non-zero emission height in the RVM and apply more detailed emission models to AR Sco.

netic ﬁeld of a static vacuum magnetic dipole is
