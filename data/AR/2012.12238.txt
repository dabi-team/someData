Abstract: We revisit the Amit-Roginsky (AR) model in the light of recent studies on
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and tensor models, with which it shares some important features.
It is a model of N scalar ﬁelds transforming in an N -dimensional irreducible representation
of SO(3). The most relevant (in renormalization group sense) invariant interaction is cubic
in the ﬁelds and mediated by a Wigner 3jm symbol. The latter can be viewed as a particular
rank-3 tensor coupling, thus highlighting the similarity to the SYK model, in which the
tensor coupling is however random and of even rank. As in the SYK and tensor models, in
the large-N limit the perturbative expansion is dominated by melonic diagrams. The lack of
randomness, and the rapidly growing number of invariants that can be built with n ﬁelds,
makes the AR model somewhat closer to tensor models. We review the results from the
old work of Amit and Roginsky with the hindsight of recent developments, correcting and
completing some of their statements, in particular concerning the spectrum of the operator
product expansion of two fundamental ﬁelds. For 5.74 < d < 6 the ﬁxed-point theory deﬁnes
a real CFT, while for smaller d complex dimensions appear, after a merging of the lowest
dimension with its shadow. We also introduce and study a long-range version of the model,
for which the cubic interaction is exactly marginal at large N , and we ﬁnd a real and unitary
CFT for any d < 6, both for real and imaginary coupling constant, up to some critical
coupling.

Following the introduction of the SYK model [1–4], and of tensor models with similar features
[5, 6], there has been some interest in quantum ﬁeld theories that in the large-N limit are
dominated by melonic diagrams. In this respect, tensor models have played a driving role, as
they are genuine quantum ﬁeld theories, whereas the SYK model is a disordered model with
a random coupling. It is of course still possible to study SYK-like models in more than one
dimension [7–9], but tensor models have some more appealing features, in particular in view
of a potential AdS/CFT correspondence, such as the fact that they have a global symmetry
from the start, which could then be gauged, whereas in SYK-like models the symmetry only
emerges after quenching. As a consequence several tensor models have been studied, with a
focus on the fact that their melonic large-N limit allows the identiﬁcation of non-trivial ﬁxed
points of the renormalization group and the non-perturbative computation of the spectrum
of bilinear operators [6, 10–21] (see also [22–25] for reviews and more references).

In this note, we wish to revisit an old model by Amit and Roginsky [26] which has a
melonic large-N limit, but which so far seems to have gone largely unnoticed in the high-

– 1 –

energy community.1 We will analyze its features with the hindsight of recent developments,
correct some small mistakes in the original analysis, and provide some further results and
generalizations of the model.

The Amit-Roginsky (AR) model has a number of interesting characteristics. First of all,
like tensor models, it is a genuine quantum ﬁeld theory with a continuous global symmetry.
The model is indeed invariant under ﬁeld transformations in an N -dimensional irreducible
representation of SO(3). Interactions are then expressed as products of q ﬁelds φm, with m =
1 . . . N , contracted with an SO(3)-invariant tensors of rank q. Interestingly, such symmetry
allows a unique cubic invariant (q = 3), the invariant tensor being given by the Wigner 3jm
symbol, with N = 2j + 1. The cubic interaction is the most relevant in the renormalization
group sense, and the main observation by Amit and Roginsky was that such interaction
leads to a melonic large-N limit.2 Therefore, the AR model provides a so far unique case of
quantum ﬁeld theory with melonic limit having a cubic interaction, as tensor models admitting
a melonic limit have always interactions with an even number of ﬁelds.

Theories with cubic interactions have been studied since the early days of the renormal-
ization group: the beta functions for a generic multiscalar model with cubic interactions have
been computed at one loop in [31], and for the case with a global symmetry such that there
is a single coupling they have been computed at two loops in [32–34], at three loops in [35],
and at four loops in [36]. One important motivation, which was also the main one of Amit
and Roginsky, comes from the Potts model, which in its ﬁeld theory formulation has a cubic
interaction [32, 37] (see also [38] and references therein), but much work has gone into models
with cubic interactions for many other reasons, e.g. [39–49]. It is therefore interesting that a
melonic limit can be realized in a theory with cubic interaction.

We also observe that in the light of the results of [50], we could view the Amit-Roginsky
model as an on-shell version (or saddle-point approximation) of a bosonic SYK-like model
with quenched disorder, i.e. with a randomly distributed rank-3 tensor coupling in place of the
3jm symbol. The distribution would need to be non-Gaussian, and with at least a “pillow”
or “tetrahedron” quartic term and a negative coupling for the quadratic term, in order to
allow a non-trivial solution, but that does not lead to crucial diﬀerences with respect to the
Gaussian case, as shown in Ref. [51]. On the other hand, there is one other aspect for which
the AR model is closer to tensor models than to the SYK model, besides it having no random
coupling: being invariant under an N -dimensional irreducible representation of SO(3), rather
than the fundamental of O(N ), it has many more invariants than just the simple bilinears
of a vector model. And they grow very rapidly with the number of ﬁelds q: as we said, for
q = 3 there is only one invariant, while for q = 4 there are already N invariants.

Lastly, we notice that, like other models with a melonic limit, also the interaction of the
AR model, being cubic in the ﬁelds, is unbounded from below. This seems to be a universal
feature of melonic theories, and it might explain the appearance of complex scaling dimensions

1The model has attracted instead some attention in the context of nonlinear stochastic equations and of

spin-glasses [27–29].

2They did not use the term “melonic”, which to the best of our knowledge was introduced in [30].

in integer spacetime dimensions (for short-range models). On the other hand, a priori the
unboundedness is not necessarily a problem at large-N , or under other circumstances. It has
been argued (see for example [35] and references therein) that in the case of a model with
just a cubic interaction the instability and its related problems can be avoided by taking an
imaginary coupling [52], as in the Lee-Yang model [53, 54], or by taking special limits, such
as the n → 0 limit of the (n + 1)-state Potts model [55], as in the percolation problem [56].
The large-N limit can have a similar eﬀect, at least near the upper critical dimension, as we
will see below. In this respect, explicit calculations in the cubic O(N ) model of [43, 44] have
shown that indeed imaginary parts of scaling dimensions are (exponentially) suppressed at
large N [57]. Moreover, along the lines of long-range O(N )3 tensor model [18–21], we will
introduce and study also a long-range version of the AR model, for which the coupling is
exactly marginal at large N , and we will ﬁnd that in this case a real and unitary CFT can be
identiﬁed at small coupling for either real or imaginary coupling, even at integer dimensions
d < 6.

Plan of the paper. We begin in Section 2 with the deﬁnition of the short-range and
long-range versions of the AR model, and a discussion of its Feynman diagrams and large-
N limit.
In Section 3 we study the melonic Schwinger-Dyson equations for the two-point
function, and in particular we recognize the generating function of 3-Catalan numbers in the
coeﬃcient of the solution in the long-range case. In Section 4 we conﬁrm by standard RG
methods the existence of the large-N ﬁxed point, while in Section 5 we consider the ﬁnite-N
corrections. Lastly, in Section 6 we study the spectrum of bilinear operators, i.e. the operators
appearing in the operator product expansion of two fundamental ﬁelds. As to that end we
use the conformal partial wave expansion of the four-point function and we take the chance
to discuss in Appendix A a small subtlety that arises in the identiﬁcation of the physical
spectrum for melonic theories with higher-order interactions. We summarize our ﬁndings in
Section 7.

2 The Amit-Roginsky model and its long-range version

The Amit-Roginsky (AR) model, introduced in Ref. [26], is a bosonic model of N complex
scalar ﬁelds φm, with m = 1 . . . N , in an irreducible representation of SO(3) of dimension
N = 2j +1, and with a cubic interaction mediated by a Wigner 3jm symbol. We will consider
a slight variation of the model, choosing real scalars and allowing the quadratic part of the
action to be long range. The action reads:

is the 3jm symbol. As at equal j’s the latter vanishes for half-integer

j, the model is restricted to integer j (that is why we have a representation of SO(3) rather
than of SU (2)), i.e. odd N . Moreover, since the 3jm symbol is antisymmetric for odd j and
symmetric for even j, we must restrict to even j for a non-vanishing interaction. For the
representation theory of SO(3) we mostly follow the notation and conventions of Ref. [58];
see also [50] for a brief list of useful formulas and conventions. Indices are raised and lowered
by the invariant metric, deﬁned as:

As a consequence of the latter identity, tadpole diagrams vanish identically.

The idea behind Amit and Roginsky’s work was to generalize the Potts model (also
described by a multiscalar theory with cubic interaction [32, 37]) by endowing it with a
continuous symmetry, in such a way to allow the introduction of a useful large-N limit.
In this optic, a single complex scalar ﬁeld (i.e. two real scalars) with a cubic interaction
corresponds to the 3-state Potts model, with a discrete symmetry group (the dihedral group
D3); the continuous SO(3) symmetry is then superimposed to it in order deﬁne the large-N
limit. Here we are not interested in the connection to the Potts model, and thus we are free
to choose real ﬁelds. We will brieﬂy compare the real and complex versions in Section 2.1.

Quartic interactions could be added to the model to stabilize the potential. There are

actually many of them, as there are 2j + 1 quartic invariants, of the form

for any J = 0, 1, . . . , 2j. However, for 4 < d < 6 such terms are irrelevant in the IR, hence
we do not include them. Moreover, it is rather common to consider unbounded potential at
large N , as the instability might be suppressed in the limit.

As a generalization of the original model, we here allow for a long-range propagator,
therefore introducing in the kinetic term a Laplacian to a power ζ, which we take to be
0 < ζ ≤ 1, in order to preserve the thermodynamic limit and reﬂection positivity of the
propagator. More concretely, we take as free propagator3

(2.6)

For ζ = 1 the upper critical dimension is d = 6, while for ζ = d/6, we ﬁnd ∆c
φ = d/3, hence
in such case the cubic term becomes marginal for any d. In order to make the interaction
slightly relevant, or to regularize the critical theory, we introduce a small parameter (cid:15), either
via dimensional continuation at ﬁxed ζ (i.e. d = 6ζ − (cid:15)), or via analytical continuation of ζ
at ﬁxed d (i.e. ζ = (d + (cid:15))/6). In the short-range case we will employ the ﬁrst continuation,
as usual, while in the long-range case we will opt for the second.

Graphical technique and large-N limit. Following standard Feynman rules, the prop-
agator and vertex of the theory imply that the amplitude of any Feynman diagram γ factors
as

Aγ = cγ

(cid:18) λ
3!

√

N

Iγ Aγ ,

(2.7)

where v(γ) is the number of vertices of γ, cγ is the combinatorial factor of the diagram, Iγ the
usual spacetime (or momentum) integral, and Aγ is a purely group theoretic factor. In order
to understand the large-N limit it is then useful to introduce two separate diagrammatic
representations for keeping track of the two contributions Iγ and Aγ to a perturbative am-
plitude, which Amit and Roginsky called “isoscalar” (or spatial) and “isospin” contribution,
respectively. We will use solid lines for the isoscalar diagrams and dashed lines for the isospin
diagrams. In the latter, a (three-valent) vertex is associated to a 3jm symbol, and an edge to
the invariant metric (2.2). A similar double representation is used also in tensor models, with
the isospin diagrams replaced by edge-colored graphs (e.g. [25]). However, while in tensor
models the edge-colored graphs encode the internal structure of the invariants sitting at the
vertices of the usual Feynman diagrams, and hence have a diﬀerent topology from the latter,
in the AR case the two types of diagrams have the same topology. Nevertheless, the isospin
diagrams are useful in determining the factor of N in a given amplitude because one can
exploit the diagrammatic rules of SU (2) recoupling theory [58], and thus perform contrac-
tions and other combinatorial operations that have no equivalent in the spatial part of the
amplitude. In particular, by using standard identities of recoupling theory, two- and three-
point diagrams are proportional to the invariant metric and the 3jm symbol, respectively,
as shown in Fig.1, and we only need to be concerned with the proportionality factors, which
are vacuum diagrams. Moreover, two- and three-particle reducible (2PR and 3PR) isospin
diagrams can be factorized as drawn in Fig. 2.

We call “fully 2PR diagrams” those diagrams for which iterating the 2PR factorization
leads to no other two-particle irreducible (2PI) diagrams than the simplest possible 2PI dia-
gram, also known as the melon diagram, represented on the right of Fig. 2. Since the latter
has isospin amplitude Amelon = 1, it follows from Fig. 2 that a fully 2PR vacuum diagram

Afully−2PR = N 1−n .

(2.8)

Combined with the explicit factor of N in (2.7), we conclude that fully 2PR diagrams are of
order one.

where {3nj} stands for a three-particle irreducible (3PI) diagram with 2n vertices, also known
as 3nj symbol. The general asymptotic behavior of 3nj symbols is an open problem,4 but in
order to determine the leading order diagrams of the AR model, a rough bound (in particular
ignoring oscillating factors of order one) is suﬃcient. By a combination of analytical evalua-
tions (for 3nj symbols of ﬁrst and second kind, i.e. those that can be written as a single sum
of products of 6j symbols [58]) and numerical estimates (for other 3nj symbols up to n = 6),

4See for example Ref. [59–62] and references therein.

Amit and Roginsky concluded that 3nj symbols are always subleading with respect to fully
2PR diagrams:

,

(2.10)

for N = (2j + 1) → ∞, with α(cid:48) > 0. As three-valent fully 2PR diagrams are equivalent to
three-valent melonic diagrams [30], we conclude that the large-N limit of the AR model is
dominated by melonic Feynman diagrams.

It should be stressed that we are currently still lacking a proper proof of the bound (2.10),
valid for all n and all kinds of 3nj symbols. However, the available results show its validity
at least up to n = 6, that is suﬃcient to prove the melonic dominance up to ﬁve loops (3nj
symbols appear for the ﬁrst time at n − 1 loops, see Section 5).

which in fact, for ζ = 1, is the original AR model. An interesting consequence of the complex
nature of the ﬁelds is that Wick contractions are only possible between a φ and a ¯φ, hence
any Feynman diagram needs to be bipartite. That is, for any Feynman diagram of the theory
it must be possible to separate its set of vertices V into two subsets, V+ and V−, such that
any vertex in one subset has only adjacent vertices from the other subset. In other words,
diagrams containing a cycle with an odd number of edges are not allowed, and thus we have a
reduced number of diagrams than in the real version of the model.5 As at large-N the theory
is still dominated by melonic diagrams, which are bipartite, the diﬀerence between real and
complex versions of the model only becomes manifest at subleading orders in 1/N , as we will
discuss in Section 5.

5Such a reduction was ﬁrst noticed in [34] for a model with SU (3) × SU (3) symmetry.

Another variant can be considered along the lines of the bi-adjoint model of [47, 48],

The eﬀect is to trivially double all the isospin diagrams, so it does not alter much the structure
of the theory. However, odd j is allowed in this case.

It would also be possible to let the two indices of φmn be in diﬀerent representations,
say j1 and j2, with both spin labels being even, or both odd, and both large. This could be
interpreted as an SO(4) invariant model, since SO(4) is isomorphic to SU (2) × SU (2).

3 Schwinger-Dyson equation for the two-point function

In the large-N limit, the melonic dominance leads to the standard melonic form for the
Schwinger-Dyson equation:

where Σ(p2) = λ2
q G(q)G(p + q) is the melonic self-energy (cf. Fig. 3). We have included a
2
ﬁeld (or wave function) renormalization Z, in order to cancel divergences proportional to p2ζ
from the self-energy. However, notice the latter only occur for ζ = 1, as they are obtained by
Taylor expanding Σ(p2) around p = 0, and thus only include integer powers of p2; in other
words, this is the well-known statement that counterterms are local, and thus the non-local
kinetic term of long-range models does not need renormalization. The mass coupling should
contain a counterterm canceling the p-independent divergent part of the self-energy, namely
Zλ2 = λc
q G(q)2, which is zero in dimensional/analytic regularization. In
the following we will ignore all such divergences which are zero in dimensional regularization.
Tuning the renormalized mass to the critical value g2 = 0, one ﬁnds the solution G(p) ∼ p−d/3,
valid in the IR limit, if ζ = 1, or at all scales, if ζ = d/6. The scaling form of the solution
suggests the existence of an IR ﬁxed point in the ﬁrst case, and a line of ﬁxed points in the
second. In order to support such picture, one needs to consider the renormalization group
ﬂow of the coupling λ, which we do in the following section.

In the case ζ = 1, we can solve the SD equation (3.1)

Notice that a > 0 for real λ and d < 6, and that ZLR is real for all positive values of a, and
ZLR ∼ a−1/3 for a → +∞. For imaginary λ we have instead a < 0, and a singular point is
found at a = −4/27, where ZLR reaches a ﬁnite value (ZLR = 3/2), but with inﬁnite slope.

Interestingly, ZLR is the generating function of 3-Catalan (or Fuss-Catalan) numbers,

that is its series expansion is

(3.7)

The appearance of 3-Catalan numbers can be easily understood. In fact, with C(p) = p−d/3,
and by use of (3.3), any melonic insertion (i.e. insertion of the one-loop two-point diagram
in an edge) in a diagram γ has the simple eﬀect of multiplying the amplitude of the original
diagram, Aγ, by a factor −a. Therefore, summing all the melonic two-point diagrams reduces
to a known combinatorial problem, whose solution is captured by the generating function of
Fuss-Catalan numbers [30].

It is also instructive and useful to solve equation (3.4) in terms of the rescaled6 coupling
g = λZ 3/2
LR . The rescaling is an eﬀective way of resumming the melonic two-point functions
and absorbing their contribution in the coupling: once we switch to the coupling g, we only
have to consider skeleton diagrams with no melonic insertions, and with C(p) = p−d/3 as
propagator. In terms of the rescaled coupling, the solution reads

i.e. the critical point of ZLR, at which the relation between g and λ ceases to be invertible.

A similar picture was found in the melonic limit of the long-range O(N )3 model in [18],
with the only diﬀerence that, the interaction being quartic, the equation for the analogue
of our ZLR was quartic in that case and its solution is the generating function of 4-Catalan
numbers.

4 Large-N beta functions and ﬁxed points

Short-range model (ζ = 1). We deﬁne the renormalized dimensionless coupling g via

λ = µ(cid:15)/2Z−3/2g ,

(4.1)

with Z the wave-function renormalization, which we can ﬁx by the renormalization condition

dΓ(2)(p)

(cid:15)→0

|p2=µ2 = 1 ,

(4.2)

where Γ(2)(p) = G(p)−1.

Since at leading-order in the large-N limit there is no vertex correction, the beta function

reads

β(g) =

g
2

(−(cid:15) + 3η(g)) ,

(4.3)

where we deﬁned the varying anomalous dimension η(g) = µ∂µ ln Z. At a non-trivial ﬁxed
point, i.e. at g = g(cid:63) (cid:54)= 0 such that β(g(cid:63)) = 0, we necessarily have η(cid:63) ≡ η(g(cid:63)) = (cid:15)/3.
Remembering that at a ﬁxed point the ﬁeld dimension is

∆φ =

d − 2 + η(cid:63)
2

,

(4.4)

we see that for d = 6 − (cid:15) and η = (cid:15)/3 we recover ∆φ = d/3, i.e. G(p) ∼ pd/3 as expected from
the SD equation.

The question is for what value of g, if any, does the anomalous dimension equal (cid:15)/3.
Such question was addressed indirectly in [26], by demanding that a slow transient in the IR
solution of the SD equation cancel. We will do a more standard computation here.

Considering the SD equation at one loop, we have to perform again the melonic integral
of Fig. 3, this time using the bare propagator with ζ = 1; we ﬁnd that Z obeys the equation

in agreement with what was obtained in [26]. Notice that since the cubic interaction is
unbounded from above and from below, we have no restriction on the sign of the coupling,
and hence the two solutions have the same status. The critical exponent describing the
approach to the ﬁxed point, also known as correction-to-scaling exponent, is given by

ω = β(cid:48)(g(cid:63)

±) = (cid:15) + O (cid:0)(cid:15)2(cid:1) ,

(4.9)

which is positive, as expected for an IR ﬁxed point. The dimension of the corresponding
cubic operator is ∆φ3 = d + ω = 6 + O (cid:0)(cid:15)2(cid:1).

Long-range model (ζ < 1).
In the long-range model, with ζ = (d + (cid:15))/6 < 1, there is no
wave function renormalization because the kinetic term is non-local, while UV divergences
always lead to local counterterms. More explicitly, we have seen in the previous subsection
that at (cid:15) = 0 the full-two point function is found to be proportional to the bare one, with
ﬁnite proportionality factor ZLR. Therefore, the anomalous dimension vanishes, and in the
large-N limit we simply have

β(g) = −(cid:15)g/2 .

(4.10)

At (cid:15) = 0, i.e. for ζ = d/6, the beta function vanishes identically, hence the interaction is
exactly marginal. Such model thus deﬁnes a one-parameter family of conformal ﬁeld theories
(or a one-dimensional conformal manifold), similarly to the melonic limit of long-range tensor
models with quartic [18] and sextic interactions [20]. However, in the case of tensor models,
there are several quartic or sextic couplings and only one of them has vanishing beta function,
hence one needs to look for ﬁxed points of the other beta functions. In the AR model instead
there is only one cubic interaction, hence there are no other beta functions to consider; the
situation resembles in this sense that of the O(N ) model with (φ2)3 interaction, which is the
only sextic interaction, and which at d = 3 and in the large-N limit is exactly marginal.

5 Finite-N beta functions and ﬁxed points

The beta functions of the short-range AR model at ﬁnite N can be obtained as a special
case of those for general multiscalar models with only one cubic coupling [32, 34–36, 48].

The starting point of such calculations is an action like in (2.1), but

replaced by a tensor dm1m2m3, which is assumed to be the only rank-3 invariant of some
underlying symmetry group. The latter assumption implies that any three-point function
must be proportional to dm1m2m3, as is the case in the SO(3) case of the AR model (see
Fig. 1).

At two loops, one only needs to introduce the following proportionality coeﬃcients (scalar

invariants of the symmetry group, or Casimirs):

T2 = 1 , T3 = (2j + 1){6j} , T5 = (2j + 1)2{9j} ,

(5.4)

where we used the notation {6j} and {9j} as a shorthand for the 6j and 9j symbols with
equal j’s, and we have used standard formulas [63], for even j. Similarly, at three loops one
ﬁnds only two new Casimirs, corresponding to the two kinds of 12j symbols, and at four loops
ﬁve new Casimirs, corresponding to the ﬁve kinds of 15j symbols [58].7

Equations (5.4) should be substituted in the beta functions from [32, 34–36, 48], which

at two loops read:

where the bar stands for the rescaled coupling ¯g2 = g2Sd/(2π)d, with Sd = 2πd/2/Γ(d/2) the
area of the (d − 1)-sphere with unit radius.

7Notice that in [36] Gracey lists nine Casimirs at four loops, but the fact that only ﬁve of them are
independent is generic, relying only on the fact that there exist only ﬁve topologies of cubic three-particle-
irreducible (3PI) vacuum diagrams with ten vertices (up to a factor N , the Casimirs are obtained by contracting
the three-point structure of the diagram with a dm1m2m3 ). Three of them do not have a unique representation
as decagons plus internal edges, but the diﬀerent representations are related by permutation of the vertices
that leave the decagon structure intact (see discussion on 15j symbols in [58]).
In his notation we ﬁnd
T93 = T95 = T97 and T92 = T96 = T98.

– 12 –

At large j, up to oscillating O(1) factors, the 3nj symbols appearing at this order behave
asymptotically as |{6j}| ≈ (2j + 1)−3/2 [64, 65] and |{9j}| ≈ (2j + 1)−2−α with 1/2 < α < 1
[26, 59].8 Therefore, the T3 and T5 contributions are subleading at large N , and and a similar
conclusion holds for the 12j and 15j symbols appearing at three and four loops, as can be
checked numerically. We can thus use the ﬁnite-N calculations to extend our large-N beta
functions to four loops, setting T2 = 1 and all the other Casimirs to zero in the results of
[36].9 We ﬁnd:

where we used the Ponzano-Regge formula for the asymptotic expansion of the 6j symbol
[65]. Therefore, the ﬁnite-N corrections do not spoil the existence of the ﬁxed point found
in the preceding section, except at N = 13. This should be contrasted with what happens
in melonic theories with quartic interactions, in which a one-loop term proportional to g2 is
suppressed at large-N with respect to a two-loop term proportional to g3, and one has to
assume that
(cid:15) (cid:29) 1/N [66]; no similar assumption is needed in the case of a cubic interaction.

√

8For generic values of the nine spins j, each rescaled by a factor k → ∞, one would have |{9j}| ≈ k−3
[63], but the case with equal j’s corresponds to a degenerate conﬁguration (a “caustic”) in which the general
asymptotic formula does not apply and a slightly slower decay is found [59].

9The beta function of [36] needs to be corrected by mapping g2 → −g2 and multiplying the coeﬃcients by

a factor 2. We thank John Gracey for explanations on this point.

– 13 –

For the long-range model instead the ﬁnite-N corrections have a drastic eﬀect, as the
beta function is no longer identically zero. In order to ﬁnd a ﬁnite-N precursor of the line of
ﬁxed points found at large-N , one has to introduce (cid:15) > 0 and use a double scaling limit with
√
N ≡ ˜(cid:15) (cid:28) 1, analogously to what was done for the long-range O(N )3 model with quartic
(cid:15)
interaction [66], or for the short-range O(N ) model with sextic interaction [67].

Going back to the short-range model, we observe that in the case of a purely imaginary
coupling, ¯g = i ˆg, the beta function for ˆg has the opposite sign for the cubic term in (5.5),
and thus an IR ﬁxed point with real ˆg ∼

(cid:15) is only found at j = 6.

√

Lastly, a small remark about the version of the model with complex ﬁelds: in this case,
diagrams with cycles of length three (triangles) are to be excluded, which eﬀectively amounts
to setting T3 = 0. At higher loops, only one 12j and one 15j symbols survive. From the
point of view of the large-N expansion, the consequence is that 1/N corrections in the beta
function only start at two loops, with the T5 term.

6 Spectrum of bilinear operators

One interesting, and much exploited, feature of the melonic limit is the possibility of deriving
the full spectrum of operators which appear in the operator product expansion (OPE) of two
fundamental ﬁelds. Such operators typically are schematically of the form φ(∂2)n∂µ1 . . . ∂µJ φ,
i.e. they are bilinear in the fundamental ﬁelds with an arbitrary number of derivatives, the
uncontracted ones endowing the operator with spin J.

Let us brieﬂy recall the theoretical background for the derivation of such OPE spectrum
(see also [68–71] for the general theory, and [19, 24, 25, 72] for applications to melonic CFTs).
First, we deﬁne the forward four-point function, i.e. the part of the four-point function which
is connected in the s-channel (12 → 34):

Fm1,m2m3,m4(x1, x2, x3, x4) = (cid:104)φm1(x1)φm2(x2)φm3(x3)φm4(x4)(cid:105)

− (cid:104)φm1(x1)φm2(x2)(cid:105) (cid:104)φm3(x3)φm4(x4)(cid:105)

= (cid:104)φm1(x1)φm2(x2)φm3(x3)φm4(x4)(cid:105)c

(6.1)

+ (cid:104)φm1(x1)φm3(x3)(cid:105) (cid:104)φm2(x2)φm4(x4)(cid:105)
+ (cid:104)φm1(x1)φm4(x4)(cid:105) (cid:104)φm2(x2)φm3(x3)(cid:105) .

The forward four-point function can be written as a conformal partial wave expansion [68,
70]:10

10Since we are considering a theory with cubic interaction we should in principle consider the part of F which
is one-particle irreducible in the s-channel, as done in [68]. However, due to the choice of index contractions
we are looking at in (6.2), and to the traceless property (2.3) of the 3jm symbol, one-particle reducible in the
s-channel do not contribute to it.

with Gh,J (xi) the conformal block, µh,J the measure, and k(h, J) the eigenvalues of the two-
particle irreducible four-point kernel, or Bethe-Salpeter kernel [68]. The latter can for example
be constructed from the 2PI eﬀective action [73]. The non-normalizable contributions are due
to operators with dimension h < d/2, and they should be treated separately [70]. We will
discuss them in more detail in App. A.

Closing the contour to the right, we pick poles at k(h, J) = 1 (other poles coming from
the measure and the conformal block are spurious and they cancel out [70]), and we recover
an OPE in the s-channel:

(6.3)

where the dimensions of spin-J operators, hn,J , are the poles of (1 − k(h, J))−1, and the
squares of the OPE coeﬃcients cn,J are the residues at the poles. Therefore, studying the
four-point kernel we can obtain the spectrum of operators that appear in the OPE of two
fundamental ﬁelds.

The decomposition (6.2) is generic and can be derived by means of the 2PI formalism;
however, the explicit expression of k(h, J) is typically only known in the large-N limit. In
melonic theories with a q-valent interaction, the four-point function is a sum of ladder skeleton
diagrams with rungs made of q − 2 edges connecting the same two vertices. In the case of our
cubic interaction, we get the simple ladders of Fig. 4. The four-point kernel corresponds to
the right-amputated single-rung ladder, and the sum over ladders is obtained as a geometric
series of kernel convolutions. The simple structure of the kernel in such case allows to extract
the conformal dimensions of the bilinear operators as solutions of the equation k(h, J) = 1.

Figure 4. The ﬁrst four contributions to the ladder expansion of four-point function in the s-channel.

Short-range model (ζ = 1). With the help of a technique that is by now standard, and
in agreement with Ref. [26], the spin-zero eigenvalues of the ladder kernel take the form

k(h, 0) = −2

Γ(d/6)Γ(2d/3)Γ(d/3 − h/2)Γ(h/2 − d/6)
Γ(−d/6)Γ(d/3)Γ(2d/3 − h/2)Γ(h/2 + d/6)

.

We made use of the fact that, by conformal invariance, the four-point kernel K satisﬁes the
general eigenvalue equation

rewrite hn = 2∆(0)
φ = 2 is the classical dimension of φ at (cid:15) = 0, and in
order to ﬁnd analytical solutions we expand z in (cid:15), and subsequently we expand also k(hn, 0),

We expressed the operator dimensions also in terms of the ﬁeld dimension at (cid:15) > 0, ∆φ =
2 − (cid:15)/3, to highlight their anomalous dimension, as 2∆φ + 2n is the classical dimension of
operators of the form φ∂2nφ. Since h−1 < d/2, the ﬁrst solution is not met when moving the
contour in (6.2) to the right, hence it should not be included in the spectrum: it corresponds
to the shadow operator [74] of the φ2 operator, with dimension h−1 = d − h0; we elaborate
further on this in App. A.11 We remark that the solutions with n ≥ 1 were missed in [26],
and moreover h−1 was mistakenly taken to be the only physical solution.

Having a full expression for k(h, 0), one can go beyond the (cid:15) expansion, and compute
the spectrum numerically in arbitrary dimension. However, it turns out that very soon the
spectrum becomes complex. By a numerical solution of the k(h, 0) = 1 equation, we ﬁnd
that at (cid:15) ≈ 0.264, h0 merges with h−1 at h0 = d/2, and then they acquire an imaginary part
at larger values of (cid:15). The appearance of a transition to complex dimensions is a recurrent
aspect of melonic CFTs [10, 12, 15, 18, 20], and it is worth stressing that this is a very
non-perturbative result, which would be hard to see from the perturbative series.

11One could be mislead to interpret h−1 as the dimension of φ, expecting it to appear in the OPE of two
fundamental ﬁelds because of the cubic interaction. However, this is incorrect for two reasons: ﬁrst, the
dimension of φ at the ﬁxed point is constrained to be ∆φ = 2 − (cid:15)/3 (cid:54)= h−1; second, the three-point function
(cid:104)φmφmφm(cid:48) (cid:105) is zero due to the traceless property (2.3) of the 3jm symbol.

– 16 –

We notice also that at the merging point, the value h0 = d/2 means that the “double-
trace” quartic operator (φ2)2 reaches marginality, because its dimension is 2h0, due to large-N
factorization. The fact that ﬁxed-point theories with cubic interactions could be destabilized
by a quartic operator becoming relevant below some dimension (see for example [35] and
references therein), and this happening above d = 4 represents a case of dangerous irrelevant
operator [75]. In the case at hand we have a range 0 ≤ (cid:15) (cid:46) 0.264 with real dimensions and
2h0 > d, while for (cid:15) (cid:38) 0.264 we have 2h0 = d + i α, with α ∈ R; therefore, the double-trace
operator never really becomes relevant, but it reaches marginality, with possible destabilizing
eﬀects (e.g. by leading to divergences in its conformal three-point functions [76]). Moreover,
a dimension of the form d/2 + i α, as that of h0, is expected to lead to an instability, because
in the AdS/CFT picture it corresponds to bulk ﬁelds violating the Breitenlohner-Freedman
bound [77], and it has been conjectured to indeed signal a spontaneous symmetry breaking
in [78].

Following [10], we can also compute the spectrum of the higher-spin operators character-
ized by spin J ∈ N. For real ﬁelds, only even J is in the spectrum, as the measure µ∆φ

The linear term in (6.14) would give a violation of the unitarity bound only for J = 1, but
since spin one is not in the spectrum, we conclude that there are no violations of unitarity
at small (cid:15). We have numerically checked that the same conclusion holds all the way up to
(cid:15) ∼ 0.264.

Demanding unitarity leads to a restriction on the allowed value of the coupling. For
g = 0, we always have hn,J = 2d/3 + 2n + J > d − 2 + J for d < 6 and n ≥ 0, hence the
free theory is unitary. As we turn on an inﬁnitesimal g2 > 0, and thus have zn,J ∼ g2, the
unitarity bounds can only be violated for n = 0, J > 0, and d close to 6. Indeed z0,J has a
negative sign, and we see that at d = 6 − (cid:15), the following non-trivial bound on the coupling
g arises from the operators with J > 0 and n = 0:

g2 ≤

The overall unitarity bound is given by the minimum of bounds over the admissible values of
J, that is for J = 2, corresponding to g2 ≤ 26π3(cid:15).

At larger values of g, and farther from six dimensions, in particular at integer dimensions,
we have to check the unitarity bounds numerically. We ﬁnd that for any d the appearance of
a complex dimension, originating as in the short-range case from the merging of h0,0 with its
shadow ˜h0,0 = d − h0,0, occurs at a smaller value of g than any possible unitarity violation.
Such merging is illustrated on the left panel of Fig. 5 for d = 5, at g = 9.17; for g (cid:38) 9.17, the
two solutions become complex, with real part equal to d/2. On the left panel of Fig. 6 we
see instead the saturation of the J = 2 unitarity bound taking place only at g = 19.3, hence
there is no unitarity violation in the range of g for which the CFT is real. In dimensions
d = 4, 3, 2, 1 a similar situation is found, with the merging of h0,0 with its shadow occurring
at g = 3.69, 1.57, 0.72, 0.36, respectively. Notice that these values remain below the critical
coupling gc,+ of eq. (3.9), which for dimensions 5 to 1, have numerical values: 26.98, 16.49,
8.89, 4.65, 2.47.

For imaginary coupling, g2 < 0 and z0,J is positive, hence the bounds (6.17) are naturally
obeyed for small g. At ﬁnite g2 < 0, h0,J keeps growing, until it merges with h1,J , as shown
in the right panels of Fig.5 and 6. The merging for J = 0 is the one that happens at the
smallest value of |g|.

Notice that the merging of the two lowest dimensions, at d = 5 and g (cid:39) i 15.2, happens
at the value h0,0 = h1,0 (cid:39) 4.64. Since at g = 0 we have h1,0 = 16/3 > 5, we see that the
operator corresponding to h1,0, which essentially is the φ∂2φ operator, crosses marginality
(at g = i 13.5) before the appearance of complex dimensions. Therefore, the ﬁxed-point
is probably destabilized by such operator, even before the merging occurs.
Interestingly,
the φ∂2φ operator is the kinetic term of the short range model, and it is believed that its
marginality crossing is responsible for the crossover from the long-range to the short-range
Ising model [79–82]; however, there are important diﬀerences to our situation:
in the Ising
case the crossover happens as one varies the value of the long-range exponent ζ, and the
φ4 interaction is not marginal in either version of the Ising model, while in the large-N AR
model we are varying the exactly marginal coupling of the cubic interaction; however, the
coupling is never marginal in the short-range version of the AR model, hence there can be
no continuous crossover from long-range to short-range AR models by simply varying g in
the former, at ﬁxed ζ = d/6. Moreover, as we have seen above, for d < 5.74 in the spectrum
of the short-range AR model there is an operator having complex dimension with real part
equal to d/2, signaling an instability of the conformal phase of the model.

7 Conclusions

In this work, we have brought under a modern perspective the Amit-Roginsky model [26],
exploiting the techniques used recently within melonic conformal ﬁeld theories. The model
involves N scalar ﬁelds forming an irreducible representation of SO(3); invariance under such
symmetry group allows for a unique cubic invariant interaction, built through the Wigner

λ
N then leads to a melonic limit at large N . Such limit is an essential ingredient to the
solvability of the SYK model, cornerstone of the nAdS2/nCF T1 holographic duality, or of
tensor models, their counterparts without disorder.
In this respect, the AR model ranges
intermediately, not needing a disorder average, yet being simpler than tensors, for which a
larger set of interactions needs to be taken into account.

Introducing a fractional laplacian (−∂)2ζ in the kinetic term, we looked at ζ = 1 and
ζ = d/6 corresponding respectively to short- and long-range models in dimension d, following
the footsteps of Refs. [18, 20] that dealt with quartic and sextic interactions.
In the ﬁrst
case, we remained close to the upper critical dimension d = 6 keeping the cubic interaction
slightly relevant and using (cid:15) = 6 − d to control our perturbative analysis. In the second case,
for 0 < d < 6, we tuned the dimension of the ﬁeld to ζ = (d + (cid:15))/6, before sending (cid:15) to
zero. Also, since the propagator is non-local in this case, no wave-function renormalization is
needed and the Schwinger-Dyson equations for the two-point function can be solved explicitly
with a power-law ansatz ZLR p−d/3, for a ﬁnite constant ZLR that can be understood as the

given in (3.9). Notice that we can allow the coupling to take imaginary value, which for an
unbounded potential such as the cubic one is a rather sensible thing to do, as for example
in the Lee-Yang model [53, 54]. By contrast, the short-range version of the model requires
a real coupling and a low-energy limit in order to lead to the same power-law solution, with
a diﬀerent proportionality constant ZSR, as well as a wave-function renormalization. We
noticed that in the limit of large bare coupling, both constants ZLR and ZSR coincide.

A recurrent property of melonic theories is that at large N the beta function of the
coupling leading to the melonic limit does not contain vertex corrections, but only the wave-
function renormalization. As a consequence, in the short-range version, for d = 6 − (cid:15), the
two Wilson-Fisher real IR ﬁxed points of [26] were recovered, while in the long-range one, we
found a line of ﬁxed points parametrized by the marginal coupling.

Moreover, we could use previous results on beta functions for generic cubic potentials, at

The existence and nature of the ﬁxed points are not changed in the short-range model (except
at N = 13, for which an imaginary coupling is needed instead). In the long-range case, since
1/N corrections break the marginality of the coupling, a more careful treatment is required
√
in terms of a double-scaling parameter ¯(cid:15) = (cid:15)

N , in line with the works [66, 67].

At the ﬁxed points, studying the conformal partial wave representation of the four-point
function, we obtained the by now standard self-consistent equation for the conformal dimen-
sions of the bilinear operators of arbitrary spin. At large-N we ﬁnd that in the short-range
AR model the spectrum is real and above unitarity bounds up to (cid:15) (cid:39) 0.264, when the smallest
dimension of the scalar operators becomes complex, with real part equal to d/2, by merging
with its shadow. In the long-range case, we have the freedom to choose real or imaginary
coupling, since it is exactly marginal. In both cases we ﬁnd that the spectrum is real and
above unitarity bounds, for small |g|. As |g| is increased, for real g we ﬁnd again a merging
of the smallest scalar operator dimension with its shadow, while for imaginary coupling we
ﬁnd that it merges (for d > 3) with the second smallest scalar operator dimension. Beyond
the merging the respective dimensions become complex.
In the case of real g, like in the
short-range case, the complex dimension has the form h0,0 = d/2 + i α, with α ∈ R, which is
expected to signal an instability, because in the AdS/CFT picture it corresponds to bulk ﬁelds
violating the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound [77, 83], and it has been conjectured to indeed
signal a spontaneous symmetry breaking in [78]. In the case of imaginary g, the complex
dimensions have real part between d/2 and d, but the model is probably destabilized before
reaching such merging, by the φ∂2φ operator crossing marginality.

We should notice that the melonic dominance at large-N in the AR model has not been
proved rigorously, but only based on a numerically checked conjecture. From a mathematical
point of view it would be interesting to ﬁnd a rigorous proof for the bound (2.10).

It is also tempting to think that due to the simpliﬁcations from the melonic limit, com-
bined with the reduced complexity of the melonic two-point function in the case of cubic
interaction, an all-order evaluation of the beta function or four-point function might be pos-
sible. The four-point function is given by the series of ladder diagrams of Fig. 4, decorated
by melonic two-point functions. In the case of a standard propagator, and without melonic
insertions, such ladder diagrams at arbitrary order have been computed explicitly in [84] in
terms of polylogarithms. It would be worth to try to generalize such results to the case of the
long-range propagator p−d/3, or to try to obtain analogue results for the melonic two-point
function diagrams.

A Conformal partial wave expansion for generalized free theories with

∆φ = d/q

In this appendix we discuss, by means of the mean ﬁeld theory example, a subtlety that
can arise in the identiﬁcation of the physical spectrum of the theory from the poles of the
conformal partial wave expansion. Our motivation for discussing this here is that in melonic
CFTs with q-valent interaction one might be induced sometime to mistake a shadow operator
for a physical one. For example, in the case of tensor models with sextic interactions (q = 6)
the appearance of a quartic operator in the OPE of two φ’s has been erroneously reported in
[10, 20]; in fact it can be checked that the supposed quartic operator dimension is actually
that of the shadow of φ2, and that it diﬀers from the dimensions of the possible quartic
invariants computed from perturbation theory.12 The main observation does not rely on the
presence of interactions, but only on the conformal dimension of φ. The latter is ﬁxed in the
long-range models, hence we can take the non-interacting limit of a long-range theory with
∆φ = d/q, and discuss the conformal partial wave expansion in such simpliﬁed setting.13

The four-point function in a generalized free CFT, also known as mean ﬁeld theory, with
a real scalar ﬁeld of dimension ∆φ can be written as in Eq. (6.2) with vanishing four-point
kernel:

F(x1, x2, x3, x4) = (cid:104)φ(x1)φ(x3)(cid:105) (cid:104)φ(x2)φ(x4)(cid:105) + (cid:104)φ(x1)φ(x4)(cid:105) (cid:104)φ(x2)φ(x3)(cid:105)

The conformal partial waves form a complete basis for ﬁeld dimension in the principal
2 + i r, with r ∈ R>0. In such case, there are no additional (non-
series [70], that is, for ∆φ = d
normalizable) contributions to (A.2), and in the conformal block integral representation we
can simply close the contour to the right to pick up the poles of the measure with Re(h) ≥ d/2.
From these we should exclude the “spurious” poles of the measure that cancel with the poles
of the conformal blocks [70]. Such spurious poles are the poles of the Γ(d − h + J) factor in
the numerator of Eq. (A.5), which we will thus ignore. For Re(h) > d/2, the only possible
poles come from Γ( 2∆φ−h+J

), i.e.:

h,J has a pole at h = h∗,
then it has a pole also at h = d − h∗, corresponding to the shadow operator. However, for
∆φ = d

the contour in (A.2) to the right. We thus obtain

and the OPE coeﬃcients are therefore real in such case, as expected.

2 −1 < ∆φ < d

In order to understand which poles are physical in a theory with ∆φ = d/q, we can
keep r > 0 while analytically continuing the real part to d/q with q > 2, and then send r
to zero. All solutions (A.6) with J or n greater than zero have real part greater than d/2

– 24 –

for d < 2q/(q − 2), the latter being the dimension beyond which ∆φ violates the unitarity
bound, hence we only need to worry about h0,0. As q → 4, the solution h0,0 and its shadow
˜h0,0 = d − h0,0 hit the line d/2 + i R, and then for q > 4 they swap place with respect to it.
The contour of integration should be deformed in such a way to keep h0,0 to its right and ˜h
to its left.

As pointed out in [70], the outcome of such contour deformation can equivalently be
obtained from an undeformed contour along the line d/2 + i R, plus a non-normalizable con-
tribution, by noticing that

Res [ρh,0Ψh,0(xi)]h=h0,0

.

Due to the minus sign in the last expression, adding the conformal partial wave contribution
to the conformal block integral representation with undeformed contour, and then moving
such contour to the right of ˜h0,0, leads to an exact cancellation of the shadow contributions.
