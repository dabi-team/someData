Abstract

Atmospheric xenon is strongly mass fractionated, the result of a process that apparently con-
tinued through the Archean and perhaps beyond. Previous models that explain Xe fractionation
by hydrodynamic hydrogen escape cannot gracefully explain how Xe escaped when Ar and Kr
did not, nor allow Xe to escape in the Archean. Here we show that Xe is the only noble gas that
can escape as an ion in a photo-ionized hydrogen wind, possible in the absence of a geomag-
netic ﬁeld or along polar magnetic ﬁeld lines that open into interplanetary space. To quantify the
hypothesis we construct new 1-D models of hydrodynamic diﬀusion-limited hydrogen escape
from highly-irradiated CO2-H2-H atmospheres. The models reveal three minimum requirements
for Xe escape: solar EUV irradiation needs to exceed 10× that of the modern Sun; the total hy-
drogen mixing ratio in the atmosphere needs to exceed 1% (equiv. to 0.5% CH4); and transport
amongst the ions in the lower ionosphere needs to lift the Xe ions to the base of the outﬂowing
hydrogen corona. The long duration of Xe escape implies that, if a constant process, Earth lost
the hydrogen from at least one ocean of water, roughly evenly split between the Hadean and the
Archean. However, to account for both Xe’s fractionation and also its depletion with respect to
Kr and primordial 244Pu, Xe escape must have been limited to small apertures or short episodes,
which suggests that Xe escape was restricted to polar windows by a geomagnetic ﬁeld, or dom-
inated by outbursts of high solar activity, or limited to transient episodes of abundant hydrogen,
or a combination of these. Xenon escape stopped when the hydrogen (or methane) mixing ratio
became too small, or EUV radiation from the aging Sun became too weak, or charge exchange
between Xe+ and O2 rendered Xe neutral.

1. Introduction

Hydrogen escape oﬀers a plausible explanation for the oxygenation of Earth’s atmosphere
(Catling et al., 2001; Zahnle et al., 2013). The mechanism is straightforward: hydrogen es-
cape irreversibly oxidizes the Earth, beginning with the atmosphere, and then working its way
down. The importance of hydrogen in Earth’s early atmosphere in promoting the formation of
molecules suitable to the origin of life was recognized before the dawn of the space age (Urey,
1952). The subsequent importance of hydrogen escape in promoting chemical evolution in a
direction suitable to creating life was also recognized by Urey (1952). The potential importance
of hydrogen escape in driving biological evolution toward oxygen-using aerobic ecologies has
not been as fully appreciated, but it is quite clear that the bias is there.

The hydrogen that escapes derives mostly from water.

It can be liberated from water by
photolysis, by photosynthesis followed by fermentation or diagenesis of organic matter releasing
H2 or CH4, or by oxidation of the crust and mantle. A smaller source was the hydrogen in
hydrocarbons delivered by asteroids and comets. Earth’s tiny Ne/N ratio, two elements that
are equally abundant in the Sun, argues persuasively against a signiﬁcant primary reservoir of
gravitationally-captured solar nebular gases (Aston, 1924; Brown, 1949; Zahnle et al., 2010).
Hydrogen is common to many atmospheric gases, but above Earth’s water vapor cold trap only
H2 or CH4 can be abundant. At still higher altitudes, atmospheric photochemistry decomposes
CH4 into H2 and other products; thus, even if CH4 were more abundant near the surface, H2
would be the more abundant species at the top of the atmosphere.

Neither hydrogen nor methane leave much of a signal in the geologic record. The D/H ratio
in old rocks has been interpreted as suggesting considerable hydrogen escape early in Earth’s
history (Pope et al., 2012), but the argument does not appear to have been widely accepted
(e.g., Korenaga et al., 2017), because the D/H ratio is relatively susceptible to alteration under
diagenesis.
In the late Archean ca 2.6-2.8 Ga there is circumstantial evidence that biogenic
methane was present in the atmosphere, implicated in the generation of isotopically light carbon
(Hayes, 1994; Hinrichs, 2002; Zerkle et al., 2012), and in the generation of “mass-independent”
isotopic fractionations of sulfur (“MIF-S”, Zahnle et al., 2006).

Here we discuss new evidence from a strange messenger that suggests that Earth’s atmo-
sphere, for much of the ﬁrst half of its history, contained a great deal of hydrogen or methane,
and that the amount of hydrogen escape may have been much greater than has been appreciated.

1.1. Xenon’s story

Xenon is the heaviest gas found in natural planetary atmospheres. It would therefore seem the
least likely to escape to space. Yet there is more circumstantial evidence that xenon has escaped
from Earth than for any element other than helium.

The evidence is of three kinds. First, the nine stable isotopes of atmospheric xenon are
strongly mass fractionated compared to any known solar system source. The magnitude of the
fractionation – about 4% per amu, or 60% from 124Xe to 136Xe – is very great. The fractionation
is easily seen on Figure 1, which compares Xe to Kr in a variety of solar system materials.

Second, atmospheric Xe is depleted with respect to meteorites by a factor of 4-20 when com-
pared to krypton. The elemental depletion is also obvious on Figure 1. Xenon’s low abundance
relative to krypton, when compared to carbonaceous chondrites, has been called the “missing
xenon” problem (Ozima and Podosek, 1983).

Third, xenon’s radiogenic isotopes are much less abundant than they should be when mea-
sured against the presumed cosmic abundances of two extinct parents. The disappearance of
radiogenic Xe does not demand fractionating xenon escape; it can be accommodated by a wide
range of speculative escape mechanisms, such as giant impacts, but it does set some limits.

Figure 1: Xenon and krypton isotopes of Earth (air), Mars (atmosphere), average carbonaceous chondritic meteorites
(AVCC), a gas-rich enstatite chondrite (S. Oman), a gas-rich enstatite achondrite (Pesyanoe), a ureilite (Havero), and
Jupiter, all normalized against solar abundances and plotted on a scale where 84Kr is one. Meteorite data are from Pepin
(1991), Mars from SNC meteorites (Swindle and Jones, 1997) and Jupiter from the Galileo Probe (Atreya et al., 2003).
Solar isotopes are from Meshik et al. (2014). The straightforward interpretation of Xe’s depletion and mass fractionation
is that Xe has preferentially escaped from the atmospheres of Earth and Mars. The inset shows Kr isotopes, the striking
features of which are the kinship between Mars and solar on one hand, and the kinship between Earth and meteorites on
the other. The modest fractionations seen in Kr all fall within the range of known meteoritical sources and hence cannot
be attributed unambiguously to escape.

life) (Pepin, 2006). This is only 1% of what Earth could have, given the estimated abundance of
iodine in the Earth and the inferred primordial relative abundance of 129I in meteorites (Tolstikhin
et al., 2014). Moreover, some or much of the excess 129Xe could be cometary (Marty et al.,
2017). Clearly xenon escape was pervasive early in the history of Earth or the materials it was
made from. However, because 129Xe escape may not be pertinent to Xe fractionation, we will
not make use of the 129I-129Xe system in this study.

A more useful constraint comes from spontaneous ﬁssion of 244Pu (half life 80 Myr), which
spawns a distinctive spectrum of heavy xenon isotopes. The initial abundance of 244Pu in Earth
can be estimated from Earth’s U abundance and the Pu/U ratio in meteorites. The amount of
ﬁssiogenic Xe in the atmosphere is determined from the diﬀerence between a smooth mass frac-
tionation process acting on Earth’s primordial Xe (U-Xe) and what is actually in the atmosphere
(Pepin, 2000, 2006). It turns out that only about 20% of the expected amount of ﬁssiogenic Xe
is in the atmosphere, and there is much less in the mantle (Tolstikhin et al., 2014). Retention of
20% of ﬁssiogenic Xe sets a bound on Xe escape taking place after plutonium’s daughters were
degassed.

Spontaneous ﬁssion of 238U (half life 4.47 Gyr) has generated about 5% as much ﬁssiogenic
Xe as Pu. It is seen in mantle samples, but taking into account that most Xe from 238U must
still be in the mantle, it cannot be responsible for more than ∼ 10% of the ﬁssiogenic Xe in the
atmosphere, which is small compared to the other uncertainties,

Until recently, despite the hint from 244Pu that not all Xe loss was early, it had generally been
supposed that xenon was fractionated and lost through an energetic process unique to the early
solar system, probably hydrodynamic hydrogen escape powered by copious EUV (“extreme ul-
traviolet radiation”) emitted by the active young Sun (Sekiya et al., 1980; Hunten et al., 1987;
Sasaki and Nakazawa, 1988; Pepin, 1991, 2006; Tolstikhin and O’Nions, 1994; Dauphas, 2003;
Dauphas and Morbidelli, 2014). Vigorous hydrodynamic hydrogen escape can be an eﬀective
way to mass fractionate heavy gases (Sekiya et al., 1980; Zahnle and Kasting, 1986; Hunten
et al., 1987; Sasaki and Nakazawa, 1988; Pepin, 1991; Dauphas and Morbidelli, 2014). Heavy
atoms escape because collisions with the outbound hydrogen push them outwards faster than
gravity can pull them back. Because lighter atoms escape preferentially, the rump atmosphere
becomes enriched in heavier atoms and isotopes. As Xe is the heaviest gas, all the other gases
must also escape. But with the possible exception of neon (Sasaki and Nakazawa, 1988), the
other gases display no isotopic evidence of having done so. Workarounds have been to pro-
pose that Kr and the other noble gases escaped quantitatively during the hydrodynamic escape
episode, while leaving some fractionated Xe behind. The lighter noble gases would later be
resupplied by a process that did not supply much xenon; several diﬀerent processes have been
suggested (Sasaki and Nakazawa, 1988; Pepin, 1991; Tolstikhin and O’Nions, 1994; Dauphas,
2003; Dauphas and Morbidelli, 2014). The discovery that atmospheric Kr is isotopically lighter
than the Kr found in the mantle (Holland et al., 2009) appears to contradict models that resupply
the atmosphere by degassing the mantle but ﬁts well with models that resupply the atmosphere
with (hypothetical) Xe-depleted comets (Dauphas and Morbidelli, 2014).

A feature common to all previous hydrodynamic escape models is that hydrogen escape
ﬂuxes large enough to power Xe escape would have been limited to Earth’s ﬁrst ∼ 100 Myrs when
the young Sun was still an enormous EUV source (Pepin, 2013). New evidence now indicates

4

that xenon’s mass fractionation evolved over the ﬁrst half of Earth’s history, only converging with
modern air between 1.8 Ga and 2.5 Ga (Pujol et al., 2011, 2013; Avice et al., 2018; Warr et al,
2018). The new evidence comes from the isotopic compositions of trapped atmospheric xenon
recovered from several ancient (2-3.5 Ga) rocks (Srinivasan, 1976; Pujol et al., 2009, 2011, 2013;
Holland et al., 2013; Avice et al., 2018; Bekaert et al., 2018). The recovered samples of Archean
xenon resemble modern air, but they are less strongly mass fractionated. We show some examples
in Figure 2. The full suite of data compiled by Avice et al. (2018) are plotted in summary form
in Figure 3, where we have compared xenon’s story to oxygen’s and sulfur’s.

Figure 2: Xenon trapped in Archean rocks (Srinivasan, 1976; Pujol et al., 2009, 2011; Avice et al., 2018) is
less fractionated than Xe in modern air. Isotopic abundances are each normalized to solar (Meshik et al.,
2014), and Xe130 is normalized to one. “Avice (2018) B” refers to a Barberton quartz dated to 3.2 ± 0.1 Ga.
“Avice (2018) F” refers to a Fortescue quartz with an assigned age of 2.7 Ga. Evidently Xe was escaping
from Earth during the Archean.

The evidence that Xe alone escaped among the noble gases requires a mechanism unique to
Xe. The evidence that Xe escape continued through the Archean requires a mechanism that can
work in Earth’s Archean atmosphere, and therefore one that can work at more modest levels of
solar EUV. Hydrodynamic xenon escape as an ion is such a mechanism. It retains the advantages
of traditional hydrodynamic escape without the two disadvantages of requiring too much solar
EUV energy and predicting even greater amounts Kr and Ar fractionation.
In particular, the
fractionation mechanism is the same — collisions push ions outwards, and gravity pulls them
back — as in neutral hydrodynamic escape. The diﬀerence is that the collisional cross sections
are much bigger between ions.

What makes it possible for Xe alone of the noble gases to escape as an ion in hydrogen is that
Xe is the only noble gas more easily ionized than hydrogen (Table 1). Hydrogen will be partially

photo-ionized. In a hydrogen-dominated hydrodynamic wind, gases that are more diﬃcult to
ionize than hydrogen will tend to be present as neutrals. But Xe, being more easily ionized
than H or H2, will tend to be present as an ion. First, Xe can be photo-ionized by UV radiation
(91.2 < λ < 102.3 nm) to which H and H2 are transparent. Second, as we shall show, Xe can
be ionized by charge exchange with H+. Third, Xe+ can be slow to recombine in hydrogen.
In particular, the important reaction Kr+ + H2 → KrH+ + H is fast. The KrH+ ion quickly
dissociatively recombines: KrH+ + e− → Kr + H. The corresponding reaction Xe+ + H2 does not
occur (Anicich, 1993). Thus Xe+ tends to persist in H2 whereas Kr+ is quickly neutralized.

Ions interact strongly with each other through the Coulomb force, especially at low temper-
atures. If the escaping hydrogen is signiﬁcantly ionized, and if the ions are also escaping, the
strong Coulomb interactions between ions permit Xe+ to escape at hydrogen escape ﬂuxes well
below what would be required for neutral Kr or even neutral Ne to escape. Under these circum-
stances fractionating hydrodynamic escape can apply uniquely to Xe among the noble gases over
a wide range of hydrogen escape ﬂuxes, despite Xe’s greater mass.

Parenthetically, it has been speculated that trapping Xe+ in organic hazes on Archean Earth
could lead to a way to fractionate Xe in the atmosphere (H´ebrard and Marty, 2014; Avice et
al., 2018). Indeed, it has recently been shown that isotopically ancient Xe was trapped, and has
remained trapped, in ancient organic matter on Earth (Bekaert et al., 2018). Ionized Xe can be
chemically incorporated into organic material (Frick et al., 1979; Marrocchi et al., 2011; Marroc-
chi and Marty, 2013). The trapped Xe is mass fractionated with a ∼ 1% per amu preference for

the heavier isotopes (Frick et al., 1979; Marrocchi et al., 2011; Marrocchi and Marty, 2013). For
trapping to work as a fractionating mechanism, most of Earth’s Xe must have resided in organic
matter through much of the Hadean and Archean, and the process must have run through several
rock weathering cycles to build up the fractionation, yet there still needs to be a Xe-speciﬁc es-
cape process, as otherwise when the trapped Xe is released by weathering the atmosphere would
regain its original unfractionated isotopic composition. We think it simpler to assign both de-
pletion and fractionation to the hydrodynamic escape process, so we have not pursued this more
complicated scenario here.

Martian atmospheric Xe as determined from SNC meteorites (Swindle and Jones, 1997) su-
perﬁcially resembles Xe in Earth’s air, which makes it tempting to imagine that Earth and Mars
received their Xe from a common fractionated source. However, martian Xe has been less im-
pacted by escape. Martian Xe is 50% less depleted than Earth’s (well-seen in Figure 1) and it has
been fractionated by about 2.5% per amu from what was initially solar Xe, whilst Earth’s was
fractionated by about 4% per amu from U-Xe. Moreover, Xe fractionation on Mars took place
very early (Cassata, 2017). These diﬀerences imply parallel evolution rather than a common
source.

To assess Xe+ escape from Earth’s ancient atmosphere, we ﬁrst need to develop a model of
irradiation-fueled diﬀusion-limited hydrodynamic hydrogen escape that includes a full energy
budget and that computes temperature and ionization as well as the escape ﬂux. This project is
described in detail in Appendix A. A subset of results pertinent to Xe escape are summarized in
Section 2. Section 3 addresses Xe chemistry and Xe escape, although the details of the model
are relegated to Appendix B, as the notation and development follow directly from the hydrogen
escape model developed in Appendix A. Section 4 addresses histories of atmospheric hydrogen
and hydrogen escape that best reproduce the observed history of Xe fractionation and depletion.
Section 5 recapitulates the chief results and chief caveats, and suggests directions for further
research. Appendix C provides a complete alphabetized table of symbols used in the text and
Appendices.

2. Hydrogen escape from a CO2-rich atmosphere

The general problem of irradiation-driven thermal escape from planetary atmosphere can get
very complicated. Here we wish to develop a description of hydrogen escape in the presence of
7

a static background atmosphere suitable for investigating Xe escape. The heavy gases in Earth’s
Archean atmosphere were likely N2 and CO2. We simplify the problem by considering a CO2-
H2 atmosphere. We chose CO2 rather than N2 because we wished to consider a case in which
both radiative heating and radiative cooling are important to the energy budget (Kulikov et al.,
2007). We will argue that, to ﬁrst approximation, photochemistry in the CO2-H2 atmosphere
allows CO2 to persist while H2 persists. Our minimum system therefore comprises only H, H2
and CO2 as neutral species. We include 5 ions: H+, H+
2 , and HCO+. We assume local
photochemical equilibrium for the ions, which is a good approximation for the molecular ions,
less good for H+ at high altitudes. This minimal system omits N2, N, CO, O, O2, NO, and their
ions. The chemistry is fully described and summarized in Table A.2 in Appendix A.

2.1. Radiation

The two essential free parameters in irradiation-driven thermal hydrogen escape are solar
irradiation S and the hydrogen mixing ratio fH2 . Hydrogen eﬃciently absorbs radiation at wave-
lengths λ < 91.2 nm. This serves as a practical deﬁnition of EUV. Water vapor and CO2 absorb
eﬃciently at wavelengths shorter than λ < 200 nm. This is a useful deﬁnition of far ultraviolet
radiation (FUV). The EUV is often lumped together with X-rays as XUV, a convenience that
exploits the relative availability of stellar X-ray luminosities.

It is observed that older sunlike stars emit less X-ray and FUV radiation (Zahnle and Walker,
1982; Ribas et al., 2005; Claire et al., 2012; Tu et al., 2015). The observations are sparse enough
to be ﬁt to power laws of the form Fxuv ∝ t−a, where t is the age of the star, and the power a is of
order unity. A popular parameterization of the average solar Fxuv at Earth is

Fxuv = 5 (4.5/t)1.24

ergs cm−2s−1

(1)

where t is the age of the Sun in Gyrs (Ribas et al., 2005). At very early times, say t < 0.1 Gyr,
this saturates to Fxuv ≈ 400 ergs cm−2s−1. FUV radiation does not decay as quickly as XUV,
but for present purposes we will ignore this detail, and lump the entire XUV and FUV emission
together as a single multiple S of the modern Sun,

S (t) ≡ Fxuv/Fxuv(cid:12).

(2)

Tu et al. (2015) compare several diﬀerent models; they estimate that 5 < S < 10 at 3.5 Ga and
10 < S < 40 at 4.0 Ga, corresponding to 1 < a < 1.7. This does not take into account the factor
ﬁve variation in XUV between active and quiet Sun. With variability included, we might expect
2 < S < 20 at 3.5 Ga and 1 < S < 10 at 2.5 Ga.

2.2. Vertical structure, method of solution, and the outer boundary conditions

Vertical structure and transport equations are simpliﬁed from the self-consistent 5 moment
approximation to multi-component hydrodynamic ﬂow presented by Schunk and Nagy (1980).
We merge this description with the description of two component diﬀusion given by Hunten
(1973) to express collision terms as binary diﬀusion coeﬃcients and to include parameterized
Eddy diﬀusivity in the lower atmosphere. We make several other major simpliﬁcations: (i)
We assume spherical symmetry. (ii) We ignore diurnal cycles and latitudinal diﬀerences. (iii)
We presume that H and H2 ﬂow outward at the same velocity u. (iv) As we are considering a
8

relatively dense gas, we use a single temperature T for all species. (v) We presume that CO2
does not escape, and thus that hydrogen must diﬀuse through the CO2. (vi) We neglect thermal
conduction, which becomes a relatively small term in the energy budget at the high levels of solar
irradiation needed if Xe is to escape. (vii) We neglect the solar wind, collisional ionization by
exogenous particles, and energy ﬂows between diﬀerent regions of the magnetosphere.

The equations and approximations are developed and fully described in Appendix A. The
ﬁve basic equations to be solved are Eq A.37 for the hydrogen velocity u(r); Eqs A.39 and A.40
for the atomic and molecular hydrogen number densities n1(r) and n2(r), respectively; Eq A.42
for the CO2 number density n3(r); and Eq A.51 for the temperature T (r). The system is solved
with the shooting method, integrating upward from a lower boundary density n(r0) = 1 × 1013
cm−3, which is below the homopause. The total H2 mixing ratio fH2 (= 0.5 fH + fH2
+ . . .)
and the total hydrogen escape ﬂux φH2 (= 0.5φH + φH2
+ . . .) at the lower boundary are
treated as independent free parameters.

+ 2 fCH4

We seek the unique transonic solution that has just enough energy at the critical point to
escape, in keeping with the philosophy that nothing that happens beyond the critical point of a
transonic wind can inﬂuence the atmosphere at the lower boundary. The energy criterion is given
by Eq A.53. The transonic solution makes the simplifying assumption that conditions far from
Earth are ignorable. This assumption is probably very good for calculating the hydrogen escape
ﬂux, which is determined by conditions much deeper in the atmosphere where the bulk of XUV
radiation is absorbed. Subsonic solutions require additional parameters to describe the conditions
of interplanetary space. As a practical matter, diﬀerences between the transonic solution and a
relevant subsonic solution are negligible save at great distances (Kasting and Pollack, 1983). We
solve for the solar irradiation S required to support φH2 by iterating S using bisection.

2.3. Snapshots taken from a particular model for purposes of illustration

It is helpful to illustrate some properties of a particular model. For this purpose we have
chosen a model (hereafter referred to as the “nominal” model) that lies well within the ﬁeld of
models in which Xe escape is predicted to take place. The key parameters are a relatively high
= 0.03). The high S of the
EUV ﬂux (S = 20) and a relatively high hydrogen mixing ratio ( fH2
nominal model would be typical before 4.0 Ga but rare after 3.5 Ga. Other nominal parameters
are a lower boundary density n(r0) = 1 × 1013 cm−3, neutral eddy diﬀusivity Kzz = 2 × 106
cm2s−1, and spherical symmetry. Our models of hydrogen escape are not very sensitive to these
= 7.2 × 1011 cm−2s−1,
other parameters. The hydrogen escape ﬂux in this particular model is φH2
equivalent to 82% of the diﬀusion-limited ﬂux (Eq A.44).

Figure 4 shows the temperature and the densities of the ions and neutrals as a function of
altitude in the nominal model; the two panels diﬀer only on how the altitude axis is scaled. The
linear scale eﬀectively illustrates the extent of the hydrogen atmosphere, while hiding everything
else. The logarithmic scaling of altitude focuses attention on the structure of the atmosphere,
in which a cold CO2-rich layer supporting a client population of cold molecular ions is overlain
by warm hydrogen and atomic ions. Other aspects of the nominal model and other models are
discussed in more detail in Appendix A.

2.4. Many solutions

Figure 5 presents results from a basic parameter survey of CO2-H2 atmospheres. The plot
shows how the total hydrogen escape ﬂux φH2 changes in response to changing solar irradiation
S and hydrogen mixing ratios fH2 . Our results (blue circles) in Figure 5 are compared to two
limits often encountered in the literature. The so-called energy-limited ﬂux compares the XUV
energy absorbed to the energy required to lift a given mass out of Earth’s potential well and into
space (Watson et al., 1981). Details are lumped together in an eﬃciency factor η that is often
taken to lie between 0.1 and 0.6 (Lammer et al., 2013; Bolmont et al., 2017). In one version
of the energy limit, all XUV photons that can be directly absorbed by hydrogen (λ < 91.2 nm)
contribute to escape. This limit is labeled “Energy-limit (XUV)” on Figure 5. A second energy
limit includes all solar radiation absorbed above a ﬁxed lower boundary. This includes FUV
radiation absorbed by CO2. This outer limit is labeled “Energy-limit (XUV+FUV)” on Figure

0.1% to 30% by volume (blue circles). These are compared to the diﬀusion-limited ﬂux for the same ﬁve
hydrogen mixing ratios (horizontal black lines) and to estimates of the energy-limited escape ﬂux, computed
either from the EUV energy that hydrogen can absorb (solid red diagonal line) or to the total XUV and FUV
energy absorbed by H2 and CO2 (broken purple line) above the (arbitrary) lower boundary of the model.
The computed escape ﬂuxes asymptote to the appropriate diﬀusion limits at high S . Smaller values of S and
fH2 are not shown because two basic assumptions of this study — that thermal conduction can be ignored
and that a hydrodynamic description is appropriate, respectively — begin to break down.

how fast hydrogen can diﬀuse through a hydrostatic atmosphere of CO2, is derived in Appendix
A in the limit of constant mixing ratios (Zahnle and Kasting, 1986; Hunten et al., 1987). Equation
A.44 is plotted on Figure 5 for each fH2 .

It is apparent from Figure 5 that the diﬀusion limit is well-obeyed as an upper limit at all
levels of irradiation we consider, and it closely approximates the actual escape ﬂux at higher
levels of solar irradiation. By contrast the energy-limited ﬂux is ambiguously deﬁned and not
obviously well-obeyed, although at low S the slope is correct. The more restricted “energy-
limited (XUV)” ﬂux can underestimate escape because it neglects FUV absorbed by CO2, whilst
the higher “energy-limited (XUV+FUV)” ﬂux overestimates escape. Key points are that FUV
absorbed by molecules other than H or H2 can be important (Sekiya et al., 1981), and that both
the energy limit and the diﬀusion limit overestimate hydrogen escape when the hydrogen above
the homopause is optically thin to EUV, as discussed by Tian et al. (2005).

attributable to absorption of solar XUV by CO2, which is accounted for in our model but neglected by Kuramoto et al.
(2013).

It is interesting to compare our results to those obtained by time-stepping hydrocode models.
In Figure 6 we compare our results to those obtained by Tian et al. (2005) and Kuramoto et al.
(2013). Both hydrocode models explore transonic escape of pure H2 atmospheres from Earth in
response to enhanced levels of incident EUV radiation. Both presume that hydrogen diﬀusively
separates from a lower atmosphere comprising unspeciﬁed radiatively active heavy molecules,
implicitly CO2, although neither model actually includes CO2. The lower boundary is held to
a ﬁxed temperature and serves as an inﬁnite heat sink. Both hydrocode models include thermal
conduction.

The comparison reveals no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the predicted hydrogen escape ﬂuxes
between our shooting code and one of the hydrocodes over the limited EUV range explored
by Kuramoto et al. (2013). Both our model and Kuramoto et al. (2013) predict signiﬁcantly
more hydrogen escape than does Tian et al. (2005) for the range of S considered. Why the

Kuramoto et al. (2013) has meaning, the indication is that the physics common to the two models
are determining the outcome, and that processes treated diﬀerently (e.g., thermal conduction,
optical depth, radiative cooling) by the two models are not particularly important to hydrogen
escape.

2.5. The magnetic ﬁeld and the solar wind

In a more realistic setting of Earth, the speciﬁc properties of the outer boundary conditions
would be determined by the details of the interaction with the solar wind and the weakening of
the geomagnetic ﬁeld with distance (Figure 7). As most of the bulk properties of the hydrogen
wind are determined near the homopause where most of the XUV and FUV radiation is absorbed
(shown for the nominal model in Figure A.14 in Appendix A), the details of the outer boundary
are not likely to be very important either to hydrogen escape or to xenon escape.

Figure 7: Geometry of a polar wind in a geomagnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld prevents ions from escaping
from the tropics. Neutral hydrogen diﬀuses through the captured ions and eventually escapes, but escape
is enough impeded that the corona becomes rather dense and very hot. By contrast, the geomagnetic ﬁeld
does not prevent ion escape along the open polar ﬁeld lines, and as a consequence of free escape the gas
remains relatively cool while also retaining the capacity to drag Xe ions with it. The ﬂow of energy from
the hot dense trapped corona to the poles has the potential of greatly enhancing the eﬀective S pertinent to
the polar wind. The solar wind complicates the ﬂow but, regarded over the globe as a whole, is more likely
to aid escape than to impede it.

It is illuminating to compare the ram pressure of the incident solar wind to the ram pressure
of hydrodynamically escaping hydrogen and to the strength of the geomagnetic ﬁeld. The ram
13

˙Mswvsw ≈ 10−8 dynes cm−2 at Earth. This can
pressure of the solar wind is of the order of
be compared to the ram pressure of the hydrodynamic wind φH2 u(r/R⊕)2, which in the nominal
model is 5 × 10−7(r/R⊕)2 dynes cm−2. If we presume that ˙Msw scales with S , the two rams would
butt heads at r ≈ 1.6R⊕.

The more pertinent comparison is to the much greater strength of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld for
r < 4R⊕. A dipole ﬁeld falls oﬀ as (0.25B2
⊕/π)(R⊕/r)6 ≈ 1.5 × 10−7(6R⊕/r)6 dynes cm−2 using
B⊕ = 0.31 Gauss for Earth today. These crude estimates suggest that the solar wind will play a
major role in determining the outer boundary conditions in the absence of a geomagnetic ﬁeld,
but would have less consequence for hydrodynamic escape channeled along magnetic ﬁeld lines
in the presence of a ﬁeld, even one as small as 0.1B⊕. Whether early Earth had a signiﬁcant
magnetic ﬁeld is debated (Ozima et al., 2005; Tarduno et al., 2014; Biggin et al., 2015; Weiss et
al., 2018).

3. Xenon escape as ion

We use the solutions for H escape obtained in Section 2 and Appendix A to construct models
of Xe escape. We assume that xenon is a trace constituent that has no eﬀect on the background
atmosphere. Our purpose is to determine the minimum requirements for Xe to escape, which is
equivalent to determining whether Xe+ escape is possible. We therefore focus on Xe+. In this
section we ﬁrst discuss how we compute Xe+ escape for a given atmosphere and level of solar
irradiation. Some general considerations pertinent to Xe+ escape are outlined in Figure 8.

Figure 8: Structure of the CO2-H2 upper atmosphere
pertinent to Xe escape. There are three layers: a mixed
lower atmosphere; a relatively thin cool molecular
ionosphere with HCO+ and CO+
2 the major ions; and a
greatly distended outﬂowing upper ionosphere domi-
nated by hydrogen and its ions. The divisions between
the layers are marked homopause and “baropause.”
The latter denotes the highest altitude where heavy el-
ements are important. There are three barriers to Xe
escape as an ion. First, ion escape is blocked by a ge-
omagnetic ﬁeld save near the poles where ﬁeld lines
open into space. Second, hydrogen escape from the
atomic ionosphere must be vigorous enough that Xe
ions are swept away. Quantifying this requirement de-
termines what S and fH2 must be for Xe escape. Third,
Xe ions need to be transported through the molecu-
lar ionosphere to the baropause, probably by vertical
movements of molecular ions themselves. This too
depends on S . We model this in 1-D as an ion eddy
diﬀusivity K(cid:48)
zz, which we treat as a third parameter in
the model.

Xenon can be directly photo-ionized (Huebner et al., 1992),

Xe + hν (λ < 102.3 nm) → Xe+ + e−,

(J4)

and it can be ionized by chemical reactions with other ions. In the idealized H-H2-CO2 atmo-
sphere, the chief possibilities are reactions of neutral Xe with the primary ions H+, H+
2 , and CO+
2 .
The charge exchange reaction with CO+

is fast and important at low altitudes where CO2 is photo-ionized. The reaction of Xe with H+

occurs but it is not a source of Xe+ because the XeH+ ion dissociatively recombines; we ignore
it.

Charge exchange with H+ presents the most interesting case. In general, charge exchange
reactions between light atoms are slow save when the reaction is nearly resonant (Huntress,
1977). The reaction into the Xe+ ground state is far from resonance,

H+ + Xe → Xe+(2P 3

2

) + H + 1.47 eV,

(R16a)

and is therefore unlikely to be fast. On the other hand, Xe+ has a low-lying electronically-excited
state for which charge exchange is exothermic yet not far from resonance (Shakeshaft and Macek,
1972),

H+ + Xe → Xe+(2P 1

) + H + 0.16 eV.

(R16b)

2

There appear to be no relevant measurements, while a calculation by Sterling and Stancil (2011)
does not take into account ﬁne structure and thus uses large asymptotic energy separation be-
tween diﬀerent charge arrangements. We therefore revisited the calculation of the rate of R16b,
as described in Appendix B. An empirical curve ﬁt to k16b good for temperatures between 50 and
105 K is

k16b = 3.83 × 10−8T 0.386 exp

−55.8/T 0.326(cid:17)
(cid:16)

cm3s−1.

(5)

The rate k16b is of the order of 10−11 cm3s−1 at 300 K and 10−10 cm3s−1 at 800 K, rates that are
fast enough that charge exchange becomes an important source of Xe+ at high altitudes where
H+ is abundant. The reverse of R16b is 0.16 eV endothermic and therefore smaller than k16b by
a factor of the order of e−1860/T , which ensures that the excited Xe+(2P 1
) ion relaxes radiatively
or collisionally to the ground state before it can lose its charge.

2

The Xe+ ion once made does not react with H, H2, or CO2. A potentially important reaction

at lower altitudes is the nearly resonant charge exchange with O2 (Anicich, 1993)

15

R17r can be a source of Xe+ in an atmosphere without much O2, because O+
2 can be abundant in
a CO2 atmosphere without O2 being abundant (cf., Venus; Fegley, 2003), but R17 becomes an
important sink of Xe+ when O2 is abundant.

Xe+ also reacts with small hydrocarbons other than CH4 (e.g., C2H2 and C2H6, Anicich,
1993) to form HXe+, which then dissociatively recombines. This suggests that Xe escape could
be suppressed when conditions favor formation of high altitude hydrocarbon hazes (as seen on
Titan, Triton, and Pluto). Organic hazes have been a topic of extensive speculation for Archean
Earth (Domagal-Goldman et al., 2008; Zerkle et al., 2012; H´ebrard and Marty, 2014; Arney et
al., 2016; Izon et al., 2017). It might be tempting to link a possible hiatus in Xe isotopic evolution
noted by Avice et al. (2018) between 3.2 Ga and 2.7 Ga to Archean organic hazes. It has recently
been shown that isotopically ancient Xe was trapped in ancient organic matter on Earth (Bekaert
et al., 2018); however, it is not yet known if the trapping was by a high altitude haze.

boundary where the total density n(r0) = 1 × 1013 cm−3. The variant “no CO2 shield” (red dashed line)
presumes that Xe is photo-ionized through windows in CO2’s opacity.

Radiative recombination of Xe+ is the unavoidable sink. We assume that it is neither much

faster nor much slower than radiative recombination of H+,

shielding” refers to the overlap between Xe’s absorption and CO2’s absorption, both of which
are spiky between 91.2 and 102.3 nm; the base case presumes that CO2’s absorption and Xe’s
absorption fully overlap, so that CO2 shields Xe from photo-ionization. The variant, labeled “no
CO2 shield,” presumes no spectral overlap between CO2 and Xe, in which case Xe is photo-
ionized through windows in CO2’s opacity. In all cases Xe’s equilibrium ionization typically
exceeds 90%.

3.2. Xenon transport

The molecular ions, here CO+

The forces acting on Xe+ ions are the collisions with hydrogen and H+ that push Xe+ out-
wards, the collisions with CO2 that block it, the Coulomb interactions with molecular ions that
are not escaping, the electric ﬁeld that tethers the electrons to the ions, and the force of gravity
that pulls the Xe ions back to Earth. To these we add eddy mixing as described in Appendix B.
2 and HCO+, present a barrier to Xe+ escape, because Xe+ is
strongly coupled to them by the strong Coulomb interaction and the relatively high reduced mass
(compared to H+) that makes collisions proportionately more eﬀective at transferring momenta.
Molecular ions dominate Xe+ transport in the nominal model from the homopause at 10 km
above the lower boundary to the baropause at 80 km above the lower boundary, Figure B.17.
Where the molecular ions ﬂow upward, Xe+ is carried up with them and may gain the opportunity
to escape; where the ions ﬂow downward or sideways or sit quietly, Xe+ cannot escape. On Earth
today at relevant thermospheric altitudes, vertical winds of the order of 10 to 20 m s−1 are often
observed, and often sustained for an hour or more. (Ishii, 2005; Larsen and Meriwether, 2012).
We will assume that these vertical velocities, which are measured in the Doppler shifts of narrow
forbidden lines of atomic oxygen (Ishii, 2005), are also pertinent to the molecular ions. These
winds imply rapid and considerable vertical transport. An upward velocity of 20 m/s sustained
for an hour suﬃces to lift Xe+ by 70 km, which is enough to carry it through the molecular
ionosphere to where it can be handed oﬀ to protons and hydrogen escape. The molecular ions
themselves cannot get very far, because the typical lifetime against dissociative recombination
is only ∼ 10 seconds. The Xe ion’s lifetime could be much longer, possibly as long as 10 days,
its lifetime against radiative recombination. In all likelihood the reaction with O2 is the actual
sink in a CO2-rich atmosphere. For Xe+ to last an hour, the O2 density must be less than 2 × 106
cm−3, ∼ 1 ppm at the homopause. The O2 sink would be smaller in an N2-CO2-H2 atmosphere
and negligible in an N2-CO-H2 atmosphere.

The usual method of describing vertical transport in a 1-D model is through an eddy diﬀusiv-
ity Kzz that acts to reduce the gradient of the mixing ratio. As a practical matter eddy diﬀusion is
straightforward to implement in a 1-D model and it is well-behaved numerically. Equation A.30
in Appendix A provides an eﬀective deﬁnition.

Here we will deﬁne a K(cid:48)

observed vertical winds and timescales, v = 10 m/s and t = 4000 seconds, imply K(cid:48)

zz that acts on the ions at altitudes above the neutral homopause. The

zz is as turbulence. In this case K(cid:48)

4 × 109 cm2s−1. Another way to construct K(cid:48)
zz scales as the
product of the sound speed and a length scale, multiplied by a scaling factor α. This scaling
is used in the ubiquitous α-disk model of astrophysical accretion disks, with the scale length
equated to the scale height. The models work best with α of the order of 0.1 to 0.4 (King et al,
2007). Using this prescription, a turbulent K(cid:48)
zz might be of the order of 1 × 109 − 4 × 109 cm2s−1.
Turbulence with α > 1 implies supersonic winds, which is regarded as unsustainable. On the
other hand, concerted motions could yield higher K(cid:48)

zz than turbulence.

We will use K(cid:48)

= 4 × 109 cm2s−1 for the ions as a nominal model, but it should be noted
zz vastly exceeds the neutral eddy diﬀusivity Kzz ∼ 106 cm2s−1 used

In addition to drag and gravity, the electric ﬁeld that tethers the ions to the free electrons has
to be big enough to balance half the weight of the ion, such that the sum of the masses of the
electron and the ion is (mi +me)/2 ≈ mi/2. The electric ﬁeld generated by HCO+ (29 amu) would
therefore produce an upward force of 14.5mHg, which is a relatively small correction for an ion
as massive as Xe+, but quite big for light ions like H+ and O+. We include the electric force on
Xe+ as a modiﬁcation of the gravitational force by computing the mean mass of the ions µ+.

The governing equation for Xe+ escape is developed in Appendix B as Eq B.14. Equation
B.14 is a diﬀerential equation for the Xe ion velocity v j(r) that is solved by the shooting method.
The Xe ion velocity v j(r) is integrated upward from the lower boundary for all nine Xe isotopes.
The lower boundary velocity v j(r0) is bounded by 0 and by the hydrogen velocity u(r0) (i.e.,
Xe cannot escape more easily than hydrogen). The velocity v j(r0) at the lower boundary is
iterated until either v j(r) → u(r), in which case Xe+ escapes, or v j(r) → 0, in which case Xe+ is
hydrostatic and does not escape.

3.3. Some numerical results

We describe our results in terms of an escape factor α j of isotope j with respect to hydrogen.
The escape factor is equal to the ratio of the velocity of isotope j to the velocity of hydrogen at
the lower boundary,

α j ≡

φ j
n j(r0)

÷

φH2
nH2 (r0)

=

v j(r0)

.

(7)

The escape factor can be thought of as the relative probability that jXe escapes compared to
hydrogen.

We could deﬁne an analogous escape factor between two isotopes by taking the ratio of αi
to α j, but it is more natural in hydrodynamic escape to deﬁne a “fractionation factor” as the
diﬀerence between αi and α j,

αi j ≡ α j − αi.

(8)

We will evaluate αi j for j = 130 and i = 131.

Xe+ escape is S > 10, comparable to what is expected from the average Sun ca 3.5 Ga. At very

Figure 11 shows how the Xe escape factor α j varies as a function of hydrogen mixing ratio

hydrogen mixing ratio at the homopause for signiﬁcant Xe+ escape is ∼ 0.4%, achievable when
both S and K(cid:48)

lower bound on fH2 is ∼ 1%.

Figure 12 shows how the Xe escape factor α j depends on the modeling parameter K(cid:48)

nominal S = 20 and a variety of hydrogen mixing ratios. The modeling parameter K(cid:48)

vertical transport by ions through the lower molecular ionosphere as a diﬀusivity, a form well-

4. Fractionation

Escape factors and fractionation factors are snapshots in time. The observables — the iso-
topic fractionation and total xenon loss — are integrated quantities that depend on the cumulative
S (t)dt, the mass and composition of the atmosphere, the
histories of the solar XUV irradiation
presence or absence of a planetary magnetic ﬁeld, and probably several other things that we
haven’t addressed.

(cid:82)

A convenient way to describe the fractionation between two isotopes iXe and jXe is to com-
pare the ratio of their relative abundances at a later time tB to their relative abundances at an
earlier time tA,

where N j represents the total (column) reservoir of isotope j (number per cm2). When applied
to hydrodynamic escape, the fractionation ξi j(tA, tB) describes the relative depletion of isotope i
compared to isotope j. We will take U-Xe (Pepin, 1991, 2006) as the initial composition at tA;
our results are insensitive to this choice. In hydrodynamic escape, the rate of change of ξi j(t) can

plane where xenon escape is signiﬁcant. The shaded regions encompass models that at uniform conditions
can simultaneously reproduce both Xe’s mass fractionation and depletion. The contours are labeled by how
long it takes (elapsed time) for ﬁxed conditions to generate the observed Xe isotopic fractionation if Xe
escape is global. It takes proportionately longer if Xe escape is channeled through polar apertures; i.e., the
curve marked “10 Myr” corresponds to 100 Myrs if escape is restricted to 10% of Earth’s area. The stars
and hexagons mark exemplary cases singled out for discussion in the text.

4.1. Constraints

Xenon directly places two constraints on escape. The mass fractionation of the isotopes, ξi j
— roughly 4% per amu, about half of this taking place after 3.5 Ga — is the more secure and the
more telling, so it takes primacy. As we shall see, the most important aspect of this constraint is
that escape was drawn out over one to two billion years, which is why Xe escape implies the loss
of a great deal of water.

The second constraint is on the total xenon escape, ξ j. Total escape conﬂates the apparent 4-
20-fold depletion with respect to Kr in meteorites (Figure 1) with the missing daughter products
of spontaneous ﬁssion of 244Pu; it also lacks the historic record of evolution we have for the
isotopes. Because Earth’s original U-Xe is not found in meteorites, the depletions with respect to
Kr in meteorites are at best rough guides to what the true depletion might be. Earth retains about
20% of the Xe spawned by spontaneous ﬁssion of 244Pu (80 Myr half-life; Pepin, 1991, 2006;
Tolstikhin et al., 2014). There are enough uncertainties in Earth’s U abundance and original Pu/U
ratio, and in possible nonfractionating loss mechanisms like impact erosion) that we will simply

A third constraint is the total oxidation of the Earth. Hydrogen escape can oxidize the Earth
from an initially reduced, Moon-like state (Sharp et al., 2013). An upper bound on cumulative
oxidation is obtained by adding up the ferric iron and the CO2 contents of Earth. To ﬁrst ap-
proximation, the Fe2O3 inventory in the MORB-source mantle (> 0.3 wt%, Cottrell and Kelley,
2011) can be balanced with the oxygen from the escape of ∼ 1 ocean of water,

2FeO + H2O → Fe3O2 + H2.

(14)

Dauphas and Morbidelli (2014) estimate from CO2/Nb systematics that there are 3.4×1022 moles
of carbon on Earth (the majority in the mantle). Carbon isotopes suggest that 80% of Earth’s C
is in CO2. Although some carbon was accreted by Earth in the form of CO2 (as ice in comets
or as carbonate minerals in meteorites), most of it probably accreted in reduced form, which we
idealize as CH. The stoichiometry of carbon oxidation by H2O is

CH + 2H2O → CO2 + 5
2

H2.

(15)

If we assume that 20% of Earth’s C was directly accreted as CO2 and the other 80% as CH, the
oxidation of carbon on Earth corresponds to the oxygen extracted from ∼ 0.3 oceans of water. As
there are alternative stories to explain how the mantle became oxidized (Frost and McCammon,
2008), escape of one or two oceans of water can be regarded as an upper bound.

A fourth constraint stems from the kinetics of Earth’s oxidation. If the escaping H2 comes
from H2O, something must be oxidized and exported to the mantle, which can be rate-limiting.
It is illustrative to consider a rough upper bound set by oxidation of ferrous to ferric iron. This
includes weathering of continents and seaﬂoor. For the former, presume that continents of mod-
ern mass and 7% Fe were built, eroded, weathered, and subducted on a 1 Gyr time scale, with
100% conversion of Fe+2 to Fe+3. This would correspond to an average H2O sink of 7 × 1012
moles yr−1. For the latter, presume that the upper 1% of the seaﬂoor was oxidized and that the
mantle turned over in 1 Gyr. This corresponds to an average H2O sink of 1.4 × 1013 moles yr−1.
The latter can be compared to an Fe+2 source of 0.6 − 1.2 × 1013 moles yr−1 estimated by scaling
modern midocean ridge hydrothermal ﬂuxes (Ozaki et al., 2018). Note that Ozaki et al. (2018)
infer much higher total Fe+2 ﬂuxes of order 7 − 21 × 1013 moles yr−1, most of which is biolog-
ically recycled. The high recycled ﬂux maps to high CH4 production, which suggests that H2
levels could change dramatically in response to biological forcing; e.g., blooms.

Summed, the de novo weathering source of H2 probably did not exceed 2×1013 moles yr−1, or
0.25 oceans per Gyr. The equivalent H2 escape ﬂux — 8×1010 molecules cm−2s−1 in photochem-
ical units — corresponds to hydrogen mixing ratios ≤ 1% in a 1 bar Archean atmosphere, and is
probably insuﬃcient to support Xe escape unless the atmosphere were substantially thinner than
1 bar, or the ferrous iron oxidation rate varied signiﬁcantly in response to climate ﬂuctuations,
variations in the biological production of CH4, changes in tectonic style, or episodic continent
building.

Two other sources of H2 are worth mentioning. A big mantle source of H2 and other reduced
gases may be plausible in the Hadean while metallic iron was still extant but is less likely in
the Archean when the mantle appears to have been only modestly more reduced than today. A
more exotic possibility is that H2 and other reduced gases were injected episodically into the
23

atmosphere from degassing of reduced impacting bodies (Kasting, 1990; Hashimoto et al., 2007;
Schaefer and Fegley, 2010). A 1021 g chondritic body, comparable to the bigger Archean impact
events documented by Lowe and Byerly (2018), on reacting with Earth’s oceans would inject
of order 3 × 1018 moles of H2 into the atmosphere (0.02 bars), enough to support a burst of Xe
escape.

The D/H ratio of Earth may provide some support for the hypothesis that Earth lost an ocean
or more of water. Zahnle et al. (1990) found that the escape factor for HD with respect to H2
in diﬀusion-limited hydrogen escape with fH2 (cid:28) fCO2 is αHD ≈ 0.8. The resulting Rayleigh
fractionation of the water that remains on Earth leads to a modest enhancement of the D/H ratio,

D/H(tB)
D/H(tA)

=

(cid:32) MH2O(tA)
MH2O(tB)

(cid:33)1−0.8

.

(16)

If for example Earth lost two oceans of water by diﬀusion-limited hydrogen escape, the resulting
D/H enrichment would be of the order of 30.2 = 1.25. The predicted 25% enrichment in D/H
is less than the ∼ 40 − 60% diﬀerence between Earth’s D/H and the D/H ratios measured in
most carbonaceous chondrites, and it is small compared to the scatter between the measured D/H
ratios in the array of known possible sources of Earth’s water (Alexander et al., 2011). Pope et
al. (2012) reported that the D/H ratio of seawater at 3.8 Ga was 2.5% lighter than today, which
corresponds to the loss of about 13% of an ocean according to Eq 16.

4.2. Example 1

To quantify concepts, consider ﬁrst an order of magnitude estimate for Archean conditions,
using only the fractionation ξi j as a constraint. Assume that fractionation of 2% per amu took
place between 3.5 Ga and 2.5 Ga (Figure 3), and assume a constant integrand in Eq 11, which
eﬀectively means holding α j constant,

Using Eq 3, Eq 17 evaluates to

of its Xe between 3.5 and 2.5 Ga. In global escape, the required hydrogen loss (expressed as
equivalent water) is

which is 0.86 oceans of water (1 ocean is 1.4 × 1024 g). This is probably too much mantle
oxidation after 3.5 Ga, given that we have not addressed the ﬁrst billion years and the other half
24

of xenon’s fractionation. With the same S = 15, the extreme K(cid:48)
= 4 × 1010 cm2s−1 works with
zz
= 0.008, which corresponds to 0.35 oceans lost during the Archean. This case is marked by
fH2
the green star in the left panel of Figure 13. In both cases, the trickle of Xe escape is very close
to no Xe escape at all. In a more realistic scenario, αi j (cid:29) 5 × 10−7 where and when Xe escapes,
averaged with a more typical state in which Xe does not escape (α j = αi j = 0).

4.3. Example 2

Our second example is constrained to simultaneously match both the fractionation ξi j and the
depletion ξi. In the special case of constant integrands in Eqs 11 and 13, the fractionation ξi j and
the depletion ξ j are related by

Equation 20 is eﬀectively Rayleigh fractionation. Models with 25 < α j/αi j < 45 are marked out
in shades of color on Figure 13. In general, these solutions require high rates of escape, driven
by high fH2 or high S or both.

fH2
examples give α j = 1 × 10−2 and αi j = 2.5 × 10−4. For uniform conditions, the time scale (tB − tA)
to evolve Xe fractionation is just 3 Myrs if escape is global and 30 Myrs if escape is channelled
through polar windows open over 10% of Earth. The hydrogen lost globally in 30 Myr is only

excursions too small to drive Xe escape, or that took place at an inopportune time when S was
too small, and it will be the number and magnitude of these other events that determines how
much hydrogen escapes in total.

4.4. Example 3

Consider ﬁnally a schematic example that more explicitly invokes the geomagnetic ﬁeld.
This is the scenario illustrated schematically in Figure 7. The magnetic ﬁeld partitions escape
into two regimes. Near Earth any plausible geomagnetic ﬁeld is much stronger than the hydro-
dynamic wind, and therefore controls it. This ordering of strengths is determined by comparing
the magnetic pressure B2/4π of the ﬁeld to the ram pressure φH2 mH2u of the wind. Because the
strength of a dipole ﬁeld drops as r−6, at large distances the polar wind eventually overcomes the
ﬁeld and stretches the ﬁeld radially. The polar ﬁeld lines open out to space and both ions and
neutrals can escape. This is the situation we have been modeling.

The equatorial region, however, is quite diﬀerent. Here the ﬁeld lines remain closed and
ions, which cannot cross the ﬁeld lines, cannot escape. The result is a relatively hot and dense
quasi-static partially ionized plasma that exerts a pressure limited only by the native strength of
the geomagnetic ﬁeld. Although neutrals can still escape by diﬀusing through the ions, escape
is inhibited and is probably restricted to H and He. A detailed examination of the inﬂated mag-
netosphere is beyond the scope of this study; what is important here is that (i) Xe cannot escape
through the equatorial magnetosphere because ions are trapped, and (ii) there will be a ﬂow of
energy from the hot dense equatorial magnetosphere to the cooler, sparser, but free-ﬂowing polar
wind.

As it pertains to Xe escape, the net eﬀect of a more realistic geomagnetic geometry is to
subvert the constraint on S in the Archean that would otherwise be inferred from solar analogues.
If we take the polar wind to be described by the constant fH2
zz case from Example
3, the total hydrogen escape through the polar windows would be 0.33 oceans over 2 billion years.
If away from the poles we take S = 6, typical of the mid-Archean, the total equatorial hydrogen
loss with constant fH2 over 2 Gyr would be ∼ 1.5 ocean. In this scenario xenon escape occurs
exclusively at the poles and only at rare times when S was abnormally large, while hydrogen
escape is constant from an atmosphere that is always 2% hydrogen.

= 0.02, high K(cid:48)

5. Discussion

In this study we have argued that Xe escaped Earth as an ion and we have quantiﬁed the
hypothesis in the context of a restricted range of highly idealized models of diﬀusion-limited
hydrodynamic hydrogen escape from CO2-H2 atmospheres in the absence of inhibition by a
magnetic ﬁeld. These atmospheres develop cold lower ionospheres dominated by molecular ions
enveloped by much-extended partially-ionized hydrogen coronae that ﬂow into space, a general
structure shown schematically in Figure 8.

We identify three requirements for Xe escape: (1) Xe atoms must become ionized and remain
ionized. (2) The ﬂow of H+ to space must be great enough that collisions between the ions can
push the Xe+ ions upwards faster than they can be pulled back by gravity. (3) The Xe+ ions
must be transported by vertical winds through the cold lower ionosphere where CO2 is abundant
to high enough altitudes that outﬂowing hydrogen can sweep them away. Here we discuss each
requirement in turn.

(1) Xenon is mostly ionized above the homopause. This occurs in part because Xe can
be photo-ionized at wavelengths to which H2 and H are transparent; in part because charge
exchange of neutral Xe with CO+
2 is fast; and in part because there is a dearth of recombination

26

mechanisms faster than radiative recombination. In particular, Xe+ does not react with H, H2 or
CO2. This partiality to life as an ion would change if O2 were abundant, as was certainly the
case after the GOE (Great Oxidation Event) ca 2.4-2.1 Ga (Catling and Kasting, 2017, p. 257),
or if small hydrocarbons (other than CH4) were abundant, as could have been the case if Archean
Earth experienced a Titan-like pale orange dot phase (Domagal-Goldman et al., 2008; Arney et
al., 2016). This is because O2 and hydrocarbons like C2H2 charge exchange with Xe+ (Anicich,
1993) to render Xe neutral and subject to falling back to Earth. If a Xe+ ion reaches the hydrogen
corona, it is very likely to remain ionized because of charge exchange with H+.

(2) The H+ escape ﬂux depends on the hydrogen mixing ratio fH2 and the ﬂux of ionizing ra-
diation S . In the Hadean, when S sometimes exceeded 40, and if everything else were favorable,
Xe may have been able to escape with hydrogen mixing ratios as small as 0.4%. Otherwise more
hydrogen is needed. The minimum fH2 for Xe escape probably exceeded 1% in the Archean
when S was smaller (the lower atmosphere could be 1% H2 or 0.5% CH4 to the same eﬀect,
because CH4 is photochemically converted to H2 and other products). The minimum EUV ﬂux
for Xe escape is in the range 10 < S < 15, high enough that Xe escape would have been rare
after 3.0 Ga. These speciﬁc properties of our model are likely to be shared by any model that
uses hydrogen escape to drive Xe+ into space. A more realistic model of the polar wind might
drive oﬀ Xe with a smaller value of S , because other means of heating and ionizing would be
available to a magnetically channeled polar wind.

(3) Transport of Xe+ through the cold molecular ionosphere (Figure 8) is an unresolved
issue. If the molecular ions themselves ﬂow upwards with the hydrogen, then all is well with
Xe+ escape, but our model gives them no cause to do so. To describe vertical transport we
introduced a third modeling parameter — an ion diﬀusivity K(cid:48)
zz — to supplement the physical
parameters S and fH2 . By construction K(cid:48)
zz acts only on ions, which are strongly coupled to each
other by electromagnetic forces. Although fundamentally K(cid:48)
zz is a modeling parameter, we can
estimate its magnitude from observations of vertical winds in the thermosphere and by analogy
to turbulent viscosity in astrophysical accretion disks. Both suggest that K(cid:48)
zz could be of the order
of 4 × 109 cm2s−1. This is quite high compared to eddy diﬀusion amongst the neutrals, but we
zz is much smaller than 4 × 108 cm2s−1. The
ﬁnd that Xe cannot escape in our 1-D model if K(cid:48)
dependence of Xe escape on K(cid:48)
zz is more or less separate from the dependence on fH2 ; the former
aﬀects transport through the lower ionosphere, whilst the latter aﬀects transport in the escaping
hydrogen corona. Thus our conclusions regarding the minimum amount of hydrogen required in
the atmosphere for Xe escape are not greatly aﬀected by K(cid:48)
zz.

5.1. Other omissions and future directions

We have omitted much in order to carve out a tractable problem. We have already mentioned
transport through the molecular ions, which likely will require a 3-D MHD model to properly
address. Three other important omissions are thermal conduction, O2, and O+ ions.

Thermal conduction will smooth the thermal transition between the hydrogen corona and the
molecular ionosphere, and it can slow hydrogen escape by transporting energy from the warm
hydrogen corona to low altitudes where radiative cooling can be eﬀective. Negligible diﬀer-
ences between our results and those obtained using a time-dependent hydrocode that includes
thermal conduction (Figure 6) suggest that thermal conduction is not very important to hydrogen
escape from Earth where S > 2.5. Our own numerical experiments with hydrostatic CO2-H2
27

atmospheres suggest that hydrogen-rich atmospheres can be stabilized against escape by thermal
conduction for S < 1. This should prove an interesting topic for further research.

Charge exchange with O2 is a major threat to Xe+. The relatively oxidized CO2-H2 atmo-
spheres we have considered here are prone to spawning photochemical O2 at high altitudes,
especially given vigorous hydrogen escape. The O2 threat can be mitigated by a generally more
reduced atmosphere. Diluting CO2 with CO or N2 could go a long way toward reducing O2. O2
could also be removed by a catalytic chemical cycle involving trace constituents, as apparently
occurs on Venus. That Xe escape might require a more reduced atmosphere for early Earth than
we have considered, perhaps leading to an upper bound on the amount of CO2 in the Hadean or
Archean, and the suggestion that Xe fractionation may have continued well into the Proterozoic
in the face of O2 (Warr et al, 2018), makes this an interesting direction to take further research.
Third, O+, if present, will escape if Xe+ can escape. O+ is a better carrier for Xe+ escape
than H+ owing to its greater mass, it should be able to ionize Xe by charge exchange, and it is
known to escape from Earth today (Shelley et al., 1972), although it is not known how (Shen et
al., 2018). Considerable O+ escape would imply less oxidation of Earth, but if the presence of
O+ were the signal of considerable amounts of O2 (Mendillo et al., 2018), there would be few
Xe+ ions present and escape of Xe would be negligible. Because of this potential to undermine
somewhat our conclusions on one hand, and the potential of helping Xe escape after the rise of
oxygen on the other, we regard O+ as calling for further research.

5.2. Conclusions

Our conclusion that the H2 (or CH4) atmospheric mixing ratio was at times at least 1% or
higher through the Archean is important and perhaps unexpected. This conclusion is based on
the minimum requirements for Xe to escape at any particular time and therefore appears to be
relatively robust. In particular, it is not greatly aﬀected by the uncertainties attending the transport
of Xe through the molecular ionosphere. Either H2 or CH4 would be important to early Earth
because either gas would help create favorable environments for the origin of life (Urey, 1952;
Tian et al., 2005). Both gases can provide greenhouse warming in the struggle against the faint
young Sun (Wordsworth and Pierrehumbert, 2013a).

What is not clear is how often the H2 (or CH4) atmospheric mixing ratio was 1% or higher.
If much of the time, Earth could have lost more than an ocean’s worth of hydrogen to space.
This is comparable to the amount of oxygen stored in the mantle and crust as partner to Fe+3 and
carbon, but it pushes hard against realistic upper bounds on how rapidly iron can be oxidized and
cycled back into the mantle (Ozaki et al., 2018). The implication that Earth grew signiﬁcantly
more oxidized through the Archean may or may not be in conﬂict with evidence that the oxida-
tion state of magma sources has changed (Aulbach et al., 2017) or not changed (Nicklas et al.,
2018). However, the lost ocean is not a robust conclusion from our model, because the observed
Xe fractionation can be generated by many diﬀerent histories. In particular, histories that simul-
taneously account both for Xe’s fractionation and its depletion require that Xe escape occurred
in short intense bursts rather than as a constant trickle. Bursts of Xe escape can be caused by
solar EUV variability, or by varying amounts of atmospheric hydrogen, or perhaps by changes in
Earth’s geomagnetic ﬁeld. If hydrogen were less abundant (< 0.1%) at most times, a lost ocean
in the Archean becomes an order of magnitude overestimate.

28

In this paper we have presented Xe escape as an ion in the context of recent discoveries
of evolving Xe preserved in ancient rocks spanning the Archean (Avice et al., 2018). Xenon
escape in the Archean is a requirement that only escape as an ion can meet. Escape as an ion
also explains how Xe escapes when Kr and Ar do not, which neatly resolves the paradox that
has been the bane of traditional models of Xe fractionation in hydrodynamic escape. The mass
fractionation mechanism itself is the same as in traditional hydrodynamic escape models: it is
the competition between collisions and gravity, with the key diﬀerence being that the collisions
that drive Xe+ outward are between ions and governed by the Coulomb force.

Although we have not dwelt on the Hadean, the ion-escape model works very well on the
∼ 200 Myr time scale of the early Hadean (or early Mars), when the Sun was a bigger source
of EUV radiation. To make the ion-escape model work over the stretched out two billion year
timescale discovered by Avice et al. (2018) requires adding at least one other feature (limiting
escape to narrow polar windows, or limiting Xe escape to brief episodes), or dropping the expec-
tation that a single set of parameters should explain both Xe’s fractionation and its depletion. If
in fact Earth’s Xe fractionation took place in the deep Hadean, such that the drawn out evolution
of Xe isotopes documented by Avice et al. (2018) has other causes than the evolution of the at-
mosphere, the ion-escape model would still provide the best explanation of how Xe acquired its
fractionation.

Appendix A. Hydrogen escape from a CO2-rich atmosphere

The goal here is to develop a description of hydrogen escape in the presence of a static
background of CO2 suitable for investigating Xe escape. Our equations are simpliﬁed from the
self-consistent 5 moment approximation to multi-component hydrodynamic ﬂow presented by
(Schunk and Nagy, 1980). We merge this description with the description of two component dif-
fusion given by Hunten (1973) to express collision terms in terms of binary diﬀusion coeﬃcients
and to include parameterized Eddy diﬀusivity in the lower atmosphere.

Appendix A.1. Chemistry

We begin with the photochemistry of the H2-CO2 atmosphere. We denote the three neutral
species H, H2, and CO2 with the indices 1, 2, 3, respectively. H2 is photolyzed by EUV radiation.
It can be dissociated

The relative yields of the three channels are, respectively, 0.56 : 0.35 : 0.09 for the solar EUV
spectrum (Huebner et al., 1992). All channels eventually lead to dissociation of H2, so that the
total photodissociation rate is J2 = J2a + J2b + J2c.

Atomic H is photo-ionized by EUV radiation,

cally much more abundant than H+
CO2

3 , hence H+ is typi-
3 . At low altitudes the sink of H+ is a chemical reaction with

H+ + CO2 → HCO+ + O

(R6)
The formyl radical, HCO, is relatively easily ionized, and thus HCO+ is often abundant in astro-
physical settings. We ﬁnd it abundant in CO2-H2 atmospheres. The sink on HCO+ is dissociative
recombination,

k6 = 3.5 × 10−9 cm3s−1.

HCO+ + e− → CO + H

k7 = 1.1 × 10−5T −0.7 cm3s−1.

(R7)

CO2 can be photolyzed by both FUV and EUV. The most important FUV channel is dissociation
to the excited O(1D) state

CO2 + hν (λ < 167 nm) → CO + O(1D).

(J3a)

Although spin-forbidden, photo-dissociation to the ground state O(3P) does occur at a low rate.
At 157 nm, the quantum yield of O(3P) is of the order of 0.1 (Schmidt et al., 2013). At wave-
lengths greater than 167 nm, where CO2’s absorption cross-section is small but nonzero, we
assume that the product is mostly O(3P),

CO2 + hν (λ < 227 nm) → CO + O(3P).

(J3b)

Higher energy photons produce a variety of additional outcomes (Huebner et al., 1992), the most
important of which is ionization,

CO2 + hν (λ < 89.9 nm) → CO+

(R8)

(R9)

In this study we simplify the chemistry by omitting alternative paths that generate O+ and O+
2
from CO+
2 . Oxygen ions in particular are interesting because they too will escape in any wind
that can carry oﬀ Xe+. Because O+ is more massive than H+, it is more eﬃcient at driving oﬀ
Xe+.

The O(1D) atoms produced by CO2 photolysis react quickly with H2 to form OH, which then

reacts with CO to remake CO2. The reaction between O(1D) and H2

H2 + O(1D) → OH + H

k10 = 1.2 × 10−10 cm3s−1

(R10)

is very fast. The O(1D) can also be de-excited to the ground state by collisions with CO2

CO2 + O(1D) → CO2 + O(3P)

k11 = 1.1 × 10−10 cm3s−1

(R11)

or much less eﬃciently by collisions with atomic H (Krems et al., 2006)

H + O(1D) → H + O(3P)

k12 = 1 × 10−12 cm3s−1.

(R12)

The reaction between H2 and O(3P)

H2 + O(3P) → OH + H

k13 = 3.5 × 10−13 (T/298)2.67 e−3160/T cm3s−1

(R13)

has a signiﬁcant temperature barrier and is slow at room temperature. The reaction of CO and
OH to reconstitute CO2 is not particularly fast but lacks a signiﬁcant activation barrier, which
makes it by far the most important sink of CO

CO + OH → CO2 + H

k14 = 1.5 × 10−13 cm3s−1.

(R14)

The reverse of R14 is endothermic and does not become fast until T approaches 2000 K. The net
result of R10 (or R13) followed by R14 is reconstitution of CO2 and dissociation of H2. Hence
CO2 tends to persist while H2 persists, although as noted CO2 is dissociated by ion chemistry.
Here we will overlook dissociation of CO2 and we will assume that reaction R13 is negligible.
The net rate that CO2 photolysis leads to dissociation of H2 can then be written

CO2 + hν + H2 → CO2 + 2H

Dissociative recombination of H+
2 is relatively slow; we omit it. Despite being very short-lived,
the molecular ions (chieﬂy HCO+) are dominant at low altitudes (as illustrated in Figure 4 in the
text). The important aspect of molecular ions in the present study is that they interact strongly
with Xe+ by the Coulomb force, and hence Xe+ escape depends in part on transport by the
molecular ions.

Appendix A.2. Radiative processes

We divide the EUV and FUV spectrum Fλ into sixteen wavelength bins that capture the
essential colors for a CO2-H2 atmosphere. In particular, we bookkeep a channel between 80 nm
and 91.2 nm for ionization of atomic hydrogen at wavelengths that do not ionize CO2 or H2, and
we account for CO2’s anomalously low cross-section in the channel encompassing Lyman α.

Appendix A.2.1. Photolysis and optical depths

The total optical depth as a function of wavelength τλ is formally given by integration over

the sum of the opacities of the diﬀerent species

∂τλ/∂r =

(cid:88)

i

niσi,λ

(A.7)

where σiλ is the cross section [cm2] of species i at wavelength λ. Photolysis rates and photoion-
ization rates Ji are obtained as integrals of the form

(cid:90)

Ji = S

Fλσiλ exp (−τλ)dλ.

(A.8)

where Fλ refers to the modern mean solar XUV spectrum and S refers to the enhanced ancient
solar XUV ﬂux relative to the modern Sun (Eq 2 of the main text). The units of Ji are s−1.

Appendix A.2.2. Radiative heating

The local radiative volume heating rate [ergs cm−3s−1] is given by

Γh = S ηh

(cid:88)

i

niσiλ

Fλhc
λ

exp (−τλ)

(A.9)

where h is Planck’s constant and c is the speed of light, and ηh ≈ 0.5 is a heating eﬃciency
(Koskinen et al., 2014).

33

The total radiative heating, the integral of Γh, can be used to deﬁne an energy-limited ﬂux.
The energy-limited ﬂux is intended to be an upper bound that compares the energy incident in
XUV radiation to the energy required to lift the atmosphere into space (Watson et al., 1981).
Details are lumped together in a diﬀerent eﬃciency factor η (cid:44) ηh that is often taken to lie
between 0.1 and 0.6 (Lammer et al., 2013; Bolmont et al., 2017). The energy-limited ﬂux can
be expressed either in terms of Fxuv, or in terms of the total solar radiation absorbed above some
arbitrary altitude, a deﬁnition that implicitly takes FUV into account. With FUV taken into
account, η can exceed unity.

We consider two forms of the energy-limited ﬂuxes of H2 molecules [cm−2s−1],

M⊕ and R⊕ refer to the mass and radius of Earth; m2 is the mass of an H2 molecule; hc/λ is the
energy of a photon [ergs]; and τλ is the optical depth as a function of λ. Equations A.10 and A.11
are evaluated with η = 0.5 to compare to the ﬂuxes computed with the full model in Figures 5
and 6 of the main text.

Appendix A.2.3. CO2 cooling

The major coolant of the thermospheres of Earth, Venus and Mars is collisional excitation
of the ν2 vibrational band of CO2, probably by atomic oxygen, followed by emission of a 15
micron photon. We use the relatively simple algorithm described by Gordiets et al. (1982), based
on work by James and Kumer (1973) and Kumer and James (1974), which prioritizes generality
over ﬁdelity. We have had to make some notational changes to avoid potential confusion with
other symbols used in this study; the correspondences to the original notation are given in the
Table of Symbols (Appendix C). The volume cooling rate [ergs cm−3 s−1] is

The 4.3 micron ν3 band is stronger than the 15 micron ν2 band, but usually less important
for cooling because the temperature must be higher to excite it. We use the same formalism as
Eq A.12 with parameters appropriate to the ν3 band: hν3 = 4.5 × 10−13 ergs, σν3
= 2.47 × 10−14
= 400 s−1. The excitation temperature is 3350 K. Because the A value is higher, the
cm2, and Aν3
4.3 µm band is less easily collisionally quenched, and hence it can eﬀectively cool from deeper
levels in the atmosphere than the 15 µm band.

Appendix A.2.4. H+

3 cooling

The molecular ion H+

3 is known to be an eﬀective coolant.

It is important in the energy
budgets of the solar system’s giant planets, and Yelle (2004) showed it to be a major part of the
budget of highly irradiated exo-Jupiters. It is reasonable to expect it be important for mildly
irradiated H2-rich ionospheres we are considering here. We use a curve ﬁt to cooling rates
computed by Neale et al. (1996) to obtain the volume cooling rate

ΓH+

where a1 = 118.85, a2 = 21.488, and a3 = 1.2308. The ﬁt is for 500 < T < 3500, which covers
the range of interest for the present application.

Appendix A.2.5. Cooling by H and H+

Cooling by H and H+ can be important in the high altitude atomic ionosphere. The volume

cooling rate for free-free cooling is

Γ f f ≈ 1.7 × 10−27x1neT 1/2

ergs cm−3s−1

and for bound-free cooling is

Γb f ≈ 2.5 × 10−25x1ne

ergs cm−3s−1.

(A.18)

(A.19)

These turn out never to be important. Collisional excitation of Lyα is very important at temper-
atures on the order of ∼ 1 × 104 K (Murray-Clay et al., 2009), but is negligible for T < 8000 K.
We will not encounter conditions where Lyman α cooling is important in this study.

35

Appendix A.2.6. Radiative eﬀects of neglected species

We have omitted N2, NO, CO, O, OH, H2O, and O2. Although N2 itself does not radi-
ate unless very hot, the lowest vibrationally excited states of N2 are resonant with the ν3 CO2
asymmetric stretch at 4.3 µm, and thus collisional excitation of N2 leads directly to 4.3 µm CO2
radiation (the mechanism behind CO2 lasers). This can be important where N2 is more abundant
than CO2 and the gas is warm. Atomic oxygen and nitric oxide are important radiative coolants
on Earth today (Kulikov et al., 2007), and would likely be important on early Earth as well. The
4.8 µm CO band can be an eﬀective coolant if the atmosphere is hot. Rotational cooling by
CO is important at low temperatures and low densities in astrophysical settings. Water will be
present at ∼100 ppm while H2 persists, produced by H2 + OH → H2O + H and destroyed by
H2O + hν → OH + H. Water emission at 6.3 µm can be an eﬀective coolant, but water is also a
much stronger FUV absorber than CO2; exploratory numerical experiments suggest that heating
is probably more important than cooling. Molecular oxygen is a poor radiative coolant but a
strong FUV absorber; its role is unambiguously to heat.

Appendix A.3. Vertical structure equations

We make several sweeping simpliﬁcations to the basic equations given by Schunk and Nagy
(1980). As we are considering a relatively dense gas, we use a single temperature T for all
species. We also assume steady state and spherical symmetry. Densities, masses, and velocities
of neutral species i are denoted ni, mi, and vi, respectively.

The collision terms are appropriate to the 5-moment approximation in the limit that all the species
have the same temperature; according to Schunk and Nagy (1980) these collision terms are
valid for the Maxwell interaction potential (inverse fourth power) for arbitrary relative velocities,
which provides some justiﬁcation for using them in cases where vi − v j might approach the sound
speed. The mapping between the momentum transfer collision frequencies νi j used by Schunk
and Nagy (1980) and the binary diﬀusion coeﬃcients used by Hunten (1973) is

ber density n = (cid:80)

We will take ¯b = b23. A homopause density nh can be deﬁned by nh ≡ Kzz/¯b.

The forces on hydrogen

Here we wish to construct an expression that describes hydrogen escape. First, we expand
Equation A.30 into two equations, one for H (i = 1) and the other for H2 (i = 2). We next impose
the approximation that H and H2 ﬂow as a single ﬂuid with velocity u. With v1 = v2 = u as an
additional constraint, neither Eq A.30 for H (i = 1) nor Eq A.30 for H2 (i = 2) hold individually.
The mass-weighted sum of the two Eqs A.30 for H and H2 remains valid because the b12 terms
that couple H and H2 cancel out. This sum is written

A.37 for u(r) rather than solving for n1(r) and n2(r) directly. First, there is only one variable.
Second, the singularity (the critical point) in the system at u = c(cid:48) is explicit. Often one solves
an equation like Eq A.37 by solving for the critical point’s location, then evaluating the gradient
∂u/∂r using L’Hˆopital’s rule, then numerically integrating downward to the lower boundary.
The critical point conditions are iterated until the desired lower boundary conditions are met.
This works well for simpler systems but becomes cumbersome for an equation like Eq A.37 for
which the L’Hˆopital’s rule expression for ∂u/∂r at the critical point is complicated. Here we will
integrate Eq A.37 for u(r) upward from the lower boundary and iterate until the desired outer
boundary conditions are closely approached.

ratios (Zahnle and Kasting, 1986; Hunten et al., 1987). The Kzz terms drop out. In the particular

is bounded by the speed of sound, which is an important consideration for energy transport in a
transonic planetary wind.

As above, we assume that H and H2 ﬂow outward with the same velocity u, and that CO2 is

hydrostatic. The usual diatomic γ = 7/5 for H2 is assumed,

Thermal conduction is important when the insolation is modest and the escape ﬂux is small
or negligible, especially in cases where a hydrostatic atmosphere can be stabilized by thermal
conduction (Gross, 1972). For Earth and N2-CO2-H2 atmospheres, hydrostatic solutions of this
kind are possible for S < 1. But for a highly-irradiated planet like young Earth, ignoring Q is
an acceptable shortcut, because thermal conduction cannot simultaneously be a big term in the
energetics yet also span the dimensions of a much inﬂated thermosphere. In particular, we do not
expect thermal conduction to much exceed a 10% eﬀect for S > 10, which we will ﬁnd to be the
minimum S required for Xe escape. Figure 6, which compares our results for hydrogen escape
to those obtained using a hydrocode that includes thermal conduction (Kuramoto et al., 2013),
implies that thermal conduction can be neglected for S > 2.5 with no obvious consequences.
However, we do compute Q from our solutions as an a posteriori check for self-consistency.

Appendix A.4. Method of solution

The system is solved with the shooting method, integrating upward starting from below the
homopause. The basic equations are Eq A.37 for u(r), Eqs A.39 and A.40 for n1(r) and n2(r),
Eq A.42 for n3(r), and Eq A.51 for T (r). We seek a transonic solution that has just enough
energy at the critical point to escape. The second outer boundary condition is in keeping with
the philosophy that nothing that happens beyond the critical point can inﬂuence the atmosphere
at the lower boundary.

We assume a density n(r0), eddy diﬀusivity Kzz, and total hydrogen escape ﬂux φH2 at the
lower boundary. The temperature T (r0) is determined by solving the local energy balance be-
tween absorbed XUV and FUV radiation and radiative cooling by CO2, with the temperature
= 0. The nominal values of n(r0) and Kzz are 1 × 1013 cm−3 and 2 × 106
gradient (dT/dr)0

41

cm2s−1, respectively. The lower boundary density is larger than the nominal homopause density
nh ≡ b23/Kzz = 6 × 1012 cm−3 in our nominal model.

The total H2 mixing ratio at the lower boundary and the total hydrogen ﬂux φH2 are treated as
independent free parameters. We then solve for the solar irradiation S required to support φH2 .
The irradiation S is iterated until the hydrogen velocity u matches the speed of sound at the point
where the speciﬁc energy of the wind es

is just suﬃcient to ensure escape with no further energy input. The second outer boundary
condition is therefore

es(rc) = 2GM⊕

.

(A.53)

Equation A.52 omits CO2 as negligible at rc, and it neglects the chemical energy that would be
released if the hydrogen were to recombine.

Optical depths and the quantities that depend on them — radiative heating, radiative cooling,
and photolysis — are problematic for the shooting method because they should be computed by
integrating inward from inﬁnity. This is inconvenient when shooting outward from deep within
the atmosphere. However, because optical depth appears only as an integrated quantity, none of
the computations in this study critically depend on an exact value of τ. All that is really required
are plausible values that decrease monotonically as the shooting algorithm ascends. Hence we
make a local approximation to optical depth at each height using local densities and the local
scale height,

τiλ ≈ niσiλH
H = kBT/µg

(A.54)

(A.55)

τiλ ≈ σiλHni
where µ is the mean molecular mass averaged over the diﬀerent constituents. Comparison be-
tween our results for hydrogen escape and those obtained with a hydrocode that self-consistently
computes optical depths (Figure 6, Kuramoto et al., 2013) shows no sign that our local approxi-
mation to τ is failing in any important way.

Appendix A.5. Results for hydrogen escape

It is helpful to illustrate the properties of a particular model in some detail. For this purpose
we have chosen a model (hereafter referred to as the “nominal” model) for illustration that lies
well within the ﬁeld of models for which Xe escape is predicted to take place. The key parameters
are a relatively high EUV ﬂux (S = 20) and a relatively high hydrogen mixing ratio ( fH2
= 0.03).
Other nominal parameters are n(r0) = 1 × 1013 cm−3, Kzz = 2 × 106 cm2s−1, and spherical
symmetry. Our models of hydrogen escape are not very sensitive to the latter three parameters.
= 7.2 × 1011 cm−2s−1, equivalent to
The computed hydrogen escape ﬂux for this model is φH2
82% of the diﬀusion-limited ﬂux.

Figure 4 in the main text shows the temperature and the densities of the ions and neutrals
as a function of altitude. Figure A.14 shows temperature and local volume heating and cooling

rates as a function of altitude in the nominal model. At low altitudes where CO2 is abundant,
radiative heating and radiative cooling are in balance, the gas is cold, and very little energy is
channeled into hydrogen escape. At high altitudes there is some radiative cooling by H+
3 but not
enough to shut oﬀ hydrogen escape. Also shown are the magnitudes of local volume heating
or cooling due to thermal conduction that would be consequent to the computed temperature
structure. These terms are not actually included in the model (they would of course be smaller
if thermal conduction were included, because the atmosphere would adjust to smooth out the
temperature proﬁle); we plot local conductive heating and cooling here to show that thermal
conduction, although not small, can be neglected at S = 20 for Earth without too much loss of
accuracy.

Figure A.15 shows sound speeds and ﬂow velocities in the nominal model as a function of
altitude. The ﬂow velocity reaches the sound speed at the top of the model, which is the critical
point. In the approximation we are using in this study, the gas at the critical point has exactly the
minimum energy required to escape.

Appendix B. Xenon Chemistry and Transport

Appendix B.1. Reaction rates

To compute rates of the charge transfer reactions of H+ with neutral Xe (reactions R16a
and R16b), we used the Demkov approximation (Demkov, 1964; Olson, 1972; Swartz, 1994),
a variation of the Landau-Zener model applicable to singly charged ions, to calculate the cross
sections σ16a and σ16b. The main assumption is that the charge-exchange reaction proceeds
through non-local radial coupling between molecular states of the same symmetry. In contrast to
the Landau-Zener model, where the coupling is assumed to be local at the internuclear distance
Rx, the Demkov approximation assumes that the reaction takes place at the internuclear distance

in atomic physics, throughout this section we will use Hartree atomic units (a.u.), in which the
electron mass, the electric charge, and the Coulomb constant are set to unity and the Planck
constant is set to 2π. In a.u., the distance unit is the Bohr radius (a0 = 0.5291772Å). The energy
unit, the Hartree, is 27.211385 eV, and is exactly twice the ionization energy of H. Rx can be
determined by equating ∆U(Rx), the separation of the adiabatic electronic potentials, with

∆H(R) = H11(Xe + H+) − H22(Xe+ + H) − ∆E,

(B.1)

where H11(R) and H22(R) are incoming and outgoing adiabatic electronic interaction potentials,
respectively, and ∆E = IP(Xe) − IP(H) − Eexc is the energy defect given by the diﬀerence of
ionization potentials IP of Xe and H, with IP(Xe) = 12.1298436 eV and IP(H) = 13.6057 eV, and
Eexc is the energy of the ﬁnal excited state of Xe+. The rate coeﬃcients were calculated assuming
the electronic potential model of Sterling and Stancil (2011). The incoming channel is

outgoing channel is given by

The analyzed charge exchange process is a “type I” electron capture, where the H 1s electron

(B.5)

with β2 = 2IP(Xe). The listed expressions are suﬃcient to calculate the distance Rx where the
charge exchange takes place. Correct asymptotic energies for the two possible exit channels of
the reaction Xe+H+ are ∆E1/2 = 0.16 eV for Xe+ (2P1/2) and ∆E3/2 = 1.47 eV for Xe+ (2P3/2).
For the two cases, we computed Rx = 10.619 a.u. and U(Rx) = 0.1356 eV, and Rx = 6.935 a.u.
and U(Rx) = 1.8746 eV, respectively. For the averaged asymptotic shift, ∆Eavg = 1.03403 eV, we
obtained Rx = 7.933 a0, conﬁrming the result reported in Table 1 in Sterling and Stancil (2011).

velocities. Numerically evaluated rates are shown in Figure B.16 for temperatures between 100−
106 K. We constructed ﬁts to k(T ) = AT b exp(−c/T d), with two sets of coeﬃcients depending
on the exit channel: A = 3.83017 × 10−8 cm3s−1, b = 0.038557, c = 55.7906 Kd, d = 0.326

∆E3/2). The uncertainty of rates calculated using the Demkov approximation has been shown to
be less than a factor of three for rates larger than about 10−9 cm3s−1 (Butler and Dalgarno, 1980;
Kingdon and Ferland, 1996), which is good enough for our purposes.

where zi and z j are the charges of the ions (integers), and Ai and Ai j are the mass and the reduced
mass in amu, respectively. The mapping between momentum transfer collision frequencies νi j
and binary diﬀusion coeﬃcients is given by Eq A.29. For Xe+ and H+,

i j are much smaller (Table B.4) for the heavy molecular ions HCO+ and CO+

reduced masses are much larger.

Less important are interactions between ions and neutrals, but we include these for complete-

ness. The ion-neutral collision frequency for momentum transfer is (Schunk and Nagy, 1980)

Unless the gas is cold, the ion-neutral cross sections are not much larger than the corresponding
neutral-neutral cross sections.

bitrary lower boundary where the total density
n(r0) = 1 × 1013 cm−3. Xe+ transport takes place
in three regimes. The homopause is at ∼ 4 km.
Below the homopause Xe+ transport is collision-
ally dominated by neutral molecules. Between
10 km and 80 km (the baropause), the Xe+ ions
are collisionally dominated by molecular ions
stemming from CO2. Above 80 km, Xe+ is most
responsive to the outbound ﬂow of H+.

Equation B.14 is solved by the shooting method. The velocity v j(r) is integrated upward from the
lower boundary for all the Xe isotopes. The lower boundary velocity v j(r0) is bounded by 0 and
by the hydrogen velocity u(r0) (i.e., Xe cannot escape more easily than hydrogen). The velocity
v j(r0) at the lower boundary is iterated until either v j(r) → u(r), in which case Xe+ escapes, or
v j(r) → 0, in which case Xe+ is hydrostatic and does not escape.

Figure B.18 documents the vertical structure of Xe+ ions in the nominal model (S = 20,
