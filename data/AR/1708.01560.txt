In this paper we consider the unique nonnegative solution to the
following generalized version of the stochastic diﬀerential equation
for a continuous-state branching process.

dom measure, respectively, and γ0, γ1 and γ2 are functions on R+
with both γ1 and γ2 taking nonnegative values. Intuitively, this pro-
cess can be identiﬁed as a continuous-state branching process with
population-size-dependent branching rates and with competition. Us-
ing martingale techniques we ﬁnd rather sharp conditions on extinc-
tion, explosion and coming down from inﬁnity behaviors of the pro-
cess. Some Foster-Lyapunov type criteria are also developed for such
a process. More explicit results are obtained when γi, i = 0, 1, 2 are
power functions.

Via the Lamperti random time change the continuous-state branching
process is associated to a spectrally positive L´evy process, which allows many
semi-explicit expressions. In particular, extinction and explosion behaviors
for continuous-state branching processes were studied by Grey (1974) and
Kawazu and Watanabe (1971), respectively, and the conditions for extinction
and explosion were expressed in terms of the respective integral tests on the
function ψ.

Bertoin and Le Gall (2006) and Dawson and Li (2006, 2012) noticed the
following alternative way of characterizing continuous-state branching pro-
cesses through stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDEs in short). Let {W (dt, du) :
t, u ≥ 0} denote an (Ft)-Gaussian white noise with density measure dtdu
on (0, ∞)2. In this paper we always write π 6= 0 for a σ-ﬁnite measure
on (0, ∞). Let {N (dt, dz, du) : t, z, u > 0} denote an independent (Ft)-
Poisson random measure with intensity measure dtπ(dz)du on (0, ∞)3 and
let { ˜N (dt, dz, du) : t, z, u > 0} denote the corresponding compensated mea-
sure. Then the continuous-state branching process is a pathwise unique non-
negative solution to the following SDE that is called a Dawson-Li SDE in
Pardoux (2016):

SDEs similar to (1.2) were studied by Dawson and Li (2006, 2012) and by
Fu and Li (2010). See also Bertoin and Le Gall (2003, 2005) for related work.
We refer to Kyprianou (2006), Li (2011, 2012) and Pardoux (2016) for

reviews and literature on continuous-state branching processes.

1.2. Continuous-state branching processes with nonlinear branching. Mod-

els with interactions have gained interests in the study of branching pro-
cesses. Athreya and Ney (1972) introduced population-size-dependent Galton-
Watson branching processes in which the reproduction mechanism depends
on the population size; see also Klebaner (1984) and H¨opfner (1985) for
previous work on population-size-dependent Galton-Watson processes. An-
other class of interacting Galton-Watson processes is the so called controlled
branching processes. For a controlled branching process, the reproduction
law is ﬁxed. But before each branching time the population is regulated by
a control function. Previous work on controlled branching processes can be
found in Sevast’yanov and Zubkov (1974) and references therein. A discrete
state, continuous time branching process with population dependent branch-
ing rate can be found in Chen (1997). When the branching rate function is
a power function of the population, the extinction probability for such a
branching process was obtained in Chen (2002). When the branching rate is
a general positive nonlinear function, such a model called nonlinear Markov
branching process was studied in Pakes (2007).

The previous work on discrete-state interacting branching processes mo-
tivates the study of their continuous-state counterparts. Some population-
size-dependent continuous-state branching processes arising as scaling limits
of the corresponding discrete-state branching processes can be found in Li
(2006, 2009).

In this paper we introduce a class of continuous-state branching processes
whose branching rates depend on their current population sizes. To this
end, we consider a nonnegative solution to the following modiﬁcation of
SDE (1.2):

where γ0, γ1 and γ2 are Borel functions on R+, and both γ1 and γ2 take
nonnegative values. The unique nonnegative solution to (1.3) up to the min-
imum of its ﬁrst time of hitting 0 and its explosion time can be treated as
a continuous-state nonlinear branching process, where γi(x)/x, i = 1, 2 can

4

be interpreted as population-size-dependent branching rates and the drift
term involving γ0 can be related to either competition or population-size-
dependent continuous immigration. We refer to Duhalde et al. (2014) for
work on continuous-state branching processes with immigration. If γi(x) =
cix for c1, c2 ≥ 0, then the solution to (1.3) reduces to the classical continuous-
state branching process and satisﬁes the branching property (1.1). Observe
that the solution X to (1.3) can also be treated as a continuous-state con-
trolled branching process.

For γ2 ≡ 0, γ1(z) = z and γ0 satisfying certain conditions, the SDE (1.3)
was studied in Pardoux and Wakolbinger (2015) and in Pardoux (2016)
where the function γ0 models an impact of the current population size on
the individuals’ reproduction dynamics. If the interaction is of the type of
competition for rare resources, then increasing the population size results
in a reduction of the individuals’ birth rate and/or increment of the death
rate.

For γ1(z) = γ2(z) = z and γ0(z) = θz − γz2 with positive constants θ and
γ, solution to SDE (1.3) can be used to model the density dependence in
population dynamics of a large population with competition called logistic
branching process, and it was studied in detail by Lambert (2005). The
quadratic regulatory term has an ecological interpretation as it describes
negative interactions between each pair of individuals in the population.
The extinction behavior and the probability distribution of the extinction
time were considered in Lambert (2005). A similar model with more general
function γ0 was considered in Le et al. (2013) with its ﬁrst passage times
studied. The total mass for this model was also studied using the Lamperti
transform. Berestycki et al. (2017) gave a genealogical description for the
process based on interactive pruning of L´evy–trees, and established a Ray–
Knight representation result.

For γ0(z) = γ2(z) ≡ 0, the extinction/survival behaviors for process X as
the total mass process of a superprocess with mean ﬁeld interaction were
discussed in Wang et al. (2017) by a martingale approach. More generally, for
γ2(z) ≡ 0 the extinction, explosion and coming down from inﬁnity behaviors
for diﬀusion process X are associated to the classiﬁcation of its boundaries
at 0 and ∞, respectively; see Karlin and Taylor (1981, p. 229).

For γi(z) = cizr with r > 0, c0 ∈ R and ci ≥ 0 for i = 1, 2, the solution
to SDE (1.3), called a continuous-state polynomial branching process, was
studied by Li (2018), where the parameter r describes the degree of inter-
action. The polynomial branching process also arises as time-space scaling
limit of discrete-state nonlinear branching processes. Intuitively, functions γ1
and γ2 are population-dependent rates for branching events producing small

and large amount of children, respectively. By solving the corresponding Kol-
mogorov equations, necessary and suﬃcient conditions in terms of integral
tests were obtained for extinction, explosion and coming down from inﬁnity,
respectively. Expectations of the extinction time and explosion time were
also discussed in Li (2018), which generalizes those results in Chen (2002)
for discrete-state processes to the corresponding continuous-state processes.
The nonlinear branching processes considered in this paper generalize those
in Li (2018) by allowing diﬀerent rates for diﬀerent branching events.

Note that if ˜N is the compensated measure of a one-sided α-stable random

measure with α ∈ (1, 2), i.e.,

has a pathwise unique non-negative strong solution if γ0(z) = a1z + a2,
γ1(z) = zr1 and γ1(z) = zr2 for a1 ∈ R, a2 ≥ 0, r1 ∈ [1/2, 1] and r2 ∈
(α − 1, α]; see Corollary 4.3 in Li and Mytnik (2011). By Theorem 4.1.2 in
Li (2012) one can also convert (1.3) to another SDE:

it is shown that the extinction occurs within ﬁnite time with probability one
for 0 ≤ θ < Γ(α) and with probability 0 for θ ≥ Γ(α); see Theorems 1.1 and
1.4 of Berestycki et al. (2015).

We refer to Lambert (2005), Berestycki et al. (2010), Bansaye et al. (2015)
and Li (2018) for previous studies of coming down from inﬁnity for a branch-
ing process with logistic growth, coalescents, birth and death processes and
the polynomial branching process, respectively.

Other than the above mentioned results, we are not aware of any previous
results on hitting probability and coming down from inﬁnity for solutions to
SDEs of type (1.3). There is some literature on nonexplosion of solutions to
general SDE with jumps; see Dong (2016) for a recent result. But we do not
ﬁnd any systematic discussions on the explosion/nonexplosion dichotomy
and the coming down from inﬁnity property of the solutions.

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the extinction, explosion
and coming down from inﬁnity behaviors of the continuous-state nonlinear
branching process as solution to (1.3) and specify the associated conditions
on functions γi, i = 0, 1, 2.

For lack of negative jumps, the extinction behaviors depend on the asymp-
totic behaviors of function γi(x) as x → 0+. Intuitively, extinction can either
be caused by a large enough negative drift due to γ0 or large enough ﬂuc-
tuations due to γ1 or γ2. Even when the process has a (small) positive drift
near 0, it might still die out because of relative large ﬂuctuations.

We are also interested in the relations between the asymptotes of functions
γi(x), i = 0, 1, 2 as x → ∞ and the explosion and coming down from inﬁnity
behaviors of the nonlinear branching processes as solutions to SDEs (1.3).
When γi, i = 0, 1, 2 are not power functions with the same power, the
approach of Li (2018) fails to work. To overcome this diﬃculty we adopt an
alternative martingale approach that appeared earlier in Wang et al. (2017).
Such an approach typically involves understanding how the process exits
from consecutive intervals near 0 with the interval lengths decreasing geo-
metrically, or consecutive intervals near ∞ with the interval lengths increas-
ing geometrically. To this end, we construct the corresponding martingale
in each situation. These martingales allow to obtain estimates on both the
sequential exit probabilities and sequential exit times via optional stopping,
where the lack of negative jumps for process X comes in handy. The desired
results then follow from Borel-Cantelli type arguments. Although we focus
on SDEs of type (1.3), we expect that this approach could also adapted to
study similar properties of solutions to other SDEs with more general jump
mechanism, and it remains to be checked how sharp the desired results can
be.

NONLINEAR BRANCHING PROCESS

In addition, we show that the general nonlinear branching processes con-
sidered in this paper are closed under a Lamperti type transform, which
allows us to discuss the ﬁniteness of a weighted occupation time until ex-
tinction or explosion of the continuous-state nonlinear branching process
via considering the extinction or explosion behaviors of the time changed
process.

We also ﬁnd Foster-Lyapunov type criteria to show the irreducibility of
the nonlinear continuous-state branching processes, which is of independent
interest. We refer to Chen (2004) and Meyn and Tweedie (1993) for the
Foster-Lyapunov type criteria for explosion and stability of Markov chains.
This paper is structured as follows. After introductions in Subsections 1.1
and 1.2 on the continuous-state branching processes, Section 2 summarizes
the main results of this paper with an application and examples, where our
results are compared with the known results. In Section 3 we show that
SDE (1.3) has a unique strong solution up to the ﬁrst time of reaching 0
or explosion given that the functions γi, i = 0, 1, 2 are locally Lipschitz on
(0, ∞). Section 4 contains Foster-Lyapunov criteria type results that can be
used to show the irreducibility of the solution as a Markov process. Proofs
of the main results in Section 2 are included in Section 5.

2. Extinction, explosion and coming down from inﬁnity. With

the convention inf ∅ := ∞, for y > 0 deﬁne

y ≡ τ −(y) := inf{t > 0 : Xt < y}, τ +
τ −

y ≡ τ +(y) := inf{t > 0 : Xt > y}

and

τ −
0 := inf{t > 0 : Xt = 0}.

By a solution to SDE (1.3) we mean a c`adl`ag process X = (Xt)t≥0 satisfying
(1.3) up to time τn := τ −
n for each n ≥ 1 and Xt = lim supn→∞ Xτn−
for t ≥ τ := limn→∞ τn. Then both of the boundary points 0 and ∞ are
absorbing for X by deﬁnition.

1/n ∧ τ +

Throughout this subsection we assume that SDE (1.3) allows a unique
weak solution denoted by X := (Xt)t≥0, and consequently the process X has
the strong Markov property. In Theorem 3.1 we are going to show that (1.3)
allows a pathwise unique solution if the coeﬃcient functions γi, i = 0, 1, 2
are all locally Lipschitz. We also assume that either γ1 6≡ 0 or γ2 6≡ 0 and
that the functions γ0, γ1 and γ2 are all locally bounded on [0, ∞).

In the following we present our main results on extinction, explosion and
coming down from inﬁnity properties of process X. Most of the proofs are
deferred to Section 5.

Ga(u) := (a − 1)γ0(u)u−1 − 2−1a(a − 1)u−2γ1(u) − γ2(u)Ha(u).

We choose the function Ga to be of the particular form in (2.3) so that,
by Ito’s formula, the process constructed in Lemma 5.1 can be shown to be
a martingale, which is key for the main proofs in Section 5. The martingale
allows to obtain estimates on exits times of the processes X via optional
stopping. The conditions for extinction, explosion and coming down from
inﬁnity for the process X can be identiﬁed from the asymptotic behaviors of
Ga(u) for u near 0 or near ∞. An earlier version of Ga can be found in Wang
et al. (2017) where it was also used to construct a continuous martingale to
study the extinction behavior for the interacting super-Brownian motion.

2.1. Extinction behaviors. We ﬁrst present the two main results on the
extinction behaviors for X. Here we only consider the case that the ini-
tial value of X is small. In this way we only have to impose conditions on
function G(u) for small positive values of u. These results, combined with
Foster-Lyapunov criteria (Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2), can be used to discuss the
extinction behaviors for X with arbitrary initial value.

Theorem 2.3.

(i) Suppose that there exist constants a > 1 and r < 1
so that Ga(u) ≥ −(ln u−1)r for all small enough u > 0. Then we have
Px{τ −

0 < ∞} = 0 for all x > 0.

(ii) Suppose that there exist constants 0 < a < 1 and r > 1 so that
0 < ∞} > 0

Ga(u) ≥ (ln u−1)r for all small enough u > 0. Then Px{τ −
for all small enough x > 0.

Proof of Theorem 2.3 is deferred to Section 5.
The next results concern the ﬁrst passage probabilities for which we need

the following condition.

Condition 2.4.

(i) For any x and a with x > a > 0,

(2.4)

Px{τ −

a < ∞} > 0.

(ii) For any x and a with x > a > 0,

(2.5)

Px{τ −

a < ∞} = 1.

Proof of the next corollary is deferred to Section 5.

Corollary 2.5. Suppose that the assumption of Theorem 2.3 (ii) holds.

Then

• Px{τ −
• Px{τ −

0 < ∞} > 0 for all x > 0 if Condition 2.4 (i) holds;
0 < ∞} = 1 for all x > 0 if Condition 2.4 (ii) holds.

We can show that (i) or (ii) of Condition 2.4 hold under certain conditions
on γi, i = 0, 1, 2.

Proposition 2.6.

(i) Given x > a > 0, (2.4) holds if Φ(a, b) > 0 and

supa≤y≤b γ0(y) < ∞ for all b > a.

(ii) Given x > a > 0, suppose that Φ(a, b) > 0 for all b > a and that

γ0(y) ≤ 0 for all large enough y. Then (2.5) holds.

(iii) If γ0(a) ≤ 0 and Φ(a, b) > 0 for all b ≥ a > 0, then for each x > 0,
Px-a.s. Xt → 0 as t → ∞. Further, by the strong Markov property
either

Px{Xt = 0 for all t large enough} = 1

or

Px{Xt → 0, but Xt > 0 for all t} = 1,

and we say extinguishing occurs in the latter case.

Proof of Proposition 2.6 is deferred to Section 4 after Lemma 4.2.

Remark 2.7.

(i) Combining Proposition 2.6 and Theorem 2.3 (ii) we
ﬁnd conditions for extinction with probability one and extinguishing
with probability one, respectively.

(ii) If γ0 = γ2 ≡ 0, then the process X is the total mass of an interacting
super-Brownian motion and Theorem 2.3 generalizes Theorems 3.4
and 3.5 of Wang et al. (2017).

2.2. Explosion behaviors. Let τ +

n be the explosion time.
The solution X to SDE (1.3) explodes at a ﬁnite time if τ +

then (2.6) holds.

from inﬁnity if

We ﬁrst present equivalent conditions for coming down from inﬁnity. From
the proof one can see that they hold for any real-valued Markov processes
with no downward jumps.

Proposition 2.12. The following statements are equivalent:

(i) Process X comes down from inﬁnity.
(ii) limx→∞ Ex[τ −
(iii)

b ] < ∞ for all large b.

(2.8)

lim
b→∞

lim
x→∞

Ex[τ −

b ] = 0.

Proof. For the proof that (i) implies (ii), we refer to the proof of Theo-

rem 1.11 of Li (2018).

Suppose that (ii) holds. Then for any x′ > b, we have

(2.9)

lim
x→∞

Ex[τ −

b ] = lim
x→∞

(Ex[τ −

x′ ] + Ex′[τ −

b ]).

12

LI, P.S., YANG, X. AND ZHOU, X.

First letting x′ → ∞, and then letting b → ∞ in (2.9), we obtain (2.8). (iii)
thus holds.

(i) follows from (iii) by the Markov inequality.

(cid:3)

Theorem 2.13.

(i) If there exist constants a > 1 and r < 1 such that

(2.10)

Ga(u) ≥ −(ln u)r

for all u large, then process X stays inﬁnite.
(ii) If there exist constants 0 < a < 1, r > 1 such that

(2.11)

Ga(u) ≥ (ln u)r

for all u large enough, then process X comes down from inﬁnity.

The proof of Theorem 2.13 is deferred to Section 5.

Remark 2.14. More recently, for the process X with γ0 = γ1 = γ2,
the speeds of coming down from inﬁnity are studied in details in Dawson et
al. (2018) for the cases that either the function γi is regularly varying at
inﬁnity or γi(x) = g(x)eθx for θ > 0 and function g that is regularly varying
at inﬁnity.

2.4. An application: weighted total population. Let γ be a strictly positive
function deﬁned on [0, ∞) that is bounded on any bounded interval. In the
following, we consider the weighted occupation time, or the weighted total
population of X before explosion, deﬁned as

Proposition 2.16. We have S = ¯τ −

Remark 2.17. By Proposition 2.16 and Theorem 2.15, the ﬁniteness for
S is translated into extinction and explosion behaviors for the time changed
process ¯X for which we can apply Theorems 2.3 and 2.8. More details can
be found later in Example 2.23 in Section 2.5. If γ(x) = γ1(x) = γ2(x) ≡ x
and γ0 satisﬁes certain interaction condition, then the behaviors for S have
been studied in Theorems 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 of Le (2014).

2.5. Processes with power branching rate functions. To obtain more ex-
plicit results, in this subsection we only consider processes with power func-
tion branching rates, i.e.

γi(x) = bixri,

x > 0, i = 0, 1, 2,

for r0, r1, r2 ≥ 0, b0 ∈ R, b1, b2 ≥ 0, b1 + b2 > 0. In addition, we assume that
the measure π is deﬁned in (1.4) with 1 < α < 2. Then by (2.2),

Ga(u) =(a − 1)u−1b0ur0 − 2−1a(a − 1)u−2b1ur1

Example 2.18.

In order to apply Theorems 2.3, 2.8 and 2.13, we only
need to compare powers and coeﬃcients of the three terms in the polynomial
Ga(u) for 0 < a < 1 or a > 1, respectively. To handle the critical case of
r1 = r0 + 1 or (and) r2 = r0 + α − 1 where some terms have the same
power, we further choose the value of a close enough to 1 to obtain the
best possible results. For instance, if both r1 = r0 + 1 and r2 = r0 + α − 1
hold, for b0 > b1/2 + cα,1b2, we choose the constant a satisfying 1 < a <
b0/(b1/2 + cα,ab2), and for b0 < b1/2 + cα,1b2, we choose the constant a
satisfying (b0/(b1/2 + cα,ab2)) ∨ 0 < a < 1.

By Theorem 2.3 and Proposition 2.6, we can obtain explicit and very
sharp conditions of extinction/non-extinction for the process X in Example
2.18.

For non-extinction we have Px{τ −
following two sets of conditions holds.

0 = ∞} = 1 for all x > 0 if one of the

(i) b0 ≤ 0 and all of the following hold.

(ia) if b0 < 0, then r0 ≥ 1;
(ib) if b1 > 0, then r1 ≥ 2;
(ic) if b2 > 0, then r2 ≥ α;

(ii) b0 > 0 and all of the following hold.

(iia) if b1 > 0, then r1 ≥ (r0 + 1) ∧ 2;
(iib) if b2 > 0, then r2 ≥ (r0 − 1 + α) ∧ α;
(iic)

b0 >

b1
2

1{r1=r0+1<2} + Γ(α)b21{r2=r0+α−1<α}.

In addition, under condition (i), for all x > 0

Px{τ −

0 = ∞ and Xt → 0 as t → ∞} = 1,

i.e., extinguishing occurs.

For extinction with a positive probability we have Px{τ −
all x > 0 if one of the following two sets of conditions holds.

0 < ∞} > 0 for

(i) b0 ≤ 0 and at least one of the following hold.

NONLINEAR BRANCHING PROCESS

15

(ia) b0 < 0 and r0 < 1;
(ib) b1 > 0 and r1 < 2;
(ic) b2 > 0 and r2 < α.

(ii) b0 > 0 and at least one of the following hold.

(iia) b1 > 0 and r1 < (r0 + 1) ∧ 2;
(iib) b2 > 0 and r2 < (r0 + α − 1) ∧ α;
(iic)

b0 <

b1
2

1{r1=r0+1<2} + Γ(α)b21{r2=r0+α−1<α}.

In addition, Px{τ −

0 < ∞} = 1 for all x > 0 under condition (i).

Remark 2.19. Note that the above Condition (iic) for Px{τ −

0 = ∞} = 1
and the above Condition (iic) for Px{τ −
0 < ∞} > 0 agree with the corre-
sponding results in Berestycki et al. (2015); see the corresponding comments
in Section 1.2.

By Theorem 2.8 and Proposition 2.11, we obtain rather sharp conditions

of explosion/non-explosion for the process X in Example 2.18.

For non-explosion we have Px{τ +
or at least one of the following is true.

∞ < ∞} = 0 for all x > 0 if either b0 ≤ 0

(i) b0 > 0 and r0 ≤ 1.
(ii) b0 > 0, r0 > 1 and at least one of the following hold.

(iia) b1 > 0 and r1 > r0 + 1;
(iib) b2 > 0 and r2 > r0 + α − 1;
(iic)

b0 <

b1
2

1{r1=r0+1} + Γ(α)b21{r2=r0+α−1}.

For explosion with a positive probability we have Px{τ +

all x > 0 if b0 > 0, r0 > 1 and all of the following hold.

(i) if b1 > 0, then r1 ≤ r0 + 1;
(ii) if b2 > 0, then r2 ≤ r0 + α − 1;
(iii)

b0 >

16

LI, P.S., YANG, X. AND ZHOU, X.

Similarly, by Theorem 2.13 we obtain rather sharp conditions for coming

down from inﬁnity.

The process X in Example 2.18 comes down from inﬁnity if one of the

following holds

(i) b0 ≤ 0 and at least one of the following hold.

(ia) b0 < 0 and r0 > 1;
(ib) b1 > 0 and r1 > 2 ;
(ic) b2 > 0 and r2 > α.

(ii) b0 > 0 and at least one of the following hold.

(iia) b1 > 0 and r1 > (r0 + 1) ∨ 2;
(iib) b2 > 0 and r2 > (r0 + α − 1) ∨ α;
(iic)

b0 <

b1
2

1{r1=r0+1>2} + Γ(α)b21{r2=r0+α−1>α}.

Process X in Example 2.18 stays inﬁnite if at least one of the following

hold.

(i) b0 ≤ 0 and all of the following hold.

(ia) if b0 < 0, then r0 ≤ 1;
(ib) if b1 > 0, then r1 ≤ 2;
(ic) if b2 > 0, then r2 ≤ α.

(ii) b0 > 0 and all of the following hold.

(iia) if b1 > 0, then r1 ≤ (r0 + 1) ∨ 2;
(iib) if b2 > 0, then r2 ≤ (r0 + α − 1) ∨ α;
(iic)

b0 >

b1
2

1{r1=r0+1>2} + Γ(α)b21{r2=r0+α−1>α}.

From the above example we make the following observations.

Remark 2.20.

(i) There is no extinction if the process X has a small
enough negative drift together with small enough ﬂuctuations near 0.
If X has a positive drift, then the requirements on the ﬂuctuations are
weaker. Extinction happens with a positive probability if X has either
a large enough negative drift or large enough ﬂuctuations near 0. Even
if X has a small positive drift near 0, extinction can still happen with
a positive probability if the ﬂuctuations are large enough.

NONLINEAR BRANCHING PROCESS

17

(ii) The explosion is caused by a large enough drift associated with the func-
tion γ0. The ﬂuctuations of the process X associated with the functions
γ1 and γ2 cannot cause explosion. But large enough ﬂuctuations can
prevent the explosion from happening.

(iii) A large enough negative drift or large enough ﬂuctuations near inﬁnity
can cause coming down from inﬁnity. Even if the process X has a pos-
itive drift, large enough ﬂuctuations can still cause coming down from
inﬁnity. On the other hand, the process X with a moderate negative
drift and moderate ﬂuctuations near inﬁnity stays inﬁnite, and if it
allows large ﬂuctuations, with a large enough positive drift it can still
stay inﬁnite.

Remark 2.21.

If b2 = 0, then X is a diﬀusion whose explosion behavior
is characterized by Feller’s criterion; see e.g. Corollary 4.4 of Cherny and
Engelbert (2005). One can check that the explosion/nonexplosion conditions
in Example 2.18 are consistent with it.

Remark 2.22. Example 2.18 recovers, for the case with spectrally posi-
tive stable L´evy measure speciﬁed in (1.4), the integral tests for extinction,
explosion and coming down from inﬁnity in Theorems 1.7, 1.9 and 1.11 of
Li (2018), which were proved using a very diﬀerent approach. Recall that the
continuous-state polynomial branching process in Li (2018) is the process X
with power branching rate functions satisfying ri = r, i = 0, 1, 2. By Example
2.18 we have for the continuous-state polynomial branching process,

• Px{τ −

0 < ∞} > 0 for all x > 0, i.e. extinction occurs, if and only if

21{b16=0} + α1{b1=0,b26=0} > r;

• Px{τ +

∞ < ∞} > 0 for all x > 0, i.e. explosion occurs, if and only if

b0 > 0 and r > 1;

• The process X comes down from inﬁnity if and only if b0 ≤ 0 and

1{b06=0} + α1{b0=0,b26=0} + 21{b0=0,b16=0,b2=0} < r;

which agree the integral tests in Li (2018).

The next example is on the ﬁniteness of the weighted total population S
of X introduced in Section 2.4. The next results follow from Remark 2.17,
Theorem 2.15 and Example 2.18.

Example 2.23. Let γ(x) = xr for 0 < r < min{r0, r1, r2} in Theorem
0 = ∞} = 1

∞ = ∞} = 1 if and only if Px{¯τ −

and Px{¯τ +
∞} = 0 for x > 0 can be found in Example 2.18.

∞ = ∞} = 1. The conditions for Px{S < ∞} = Px{¯τ −

0 ∧ ¯τ +

Similarly, observe that Px{¯τ −

0 <
∞ < ∞} > 0. Then the conditions for Px{S < ∞} > 0 can

∞ < ∞} > 0 if and only if Px{¯τ −

0 ∧ ¯τ +

∞} > 0 or Px{¯τ +
also be found in Example 2.18.

3. Existence and uniqueness of solution.

In this section we ﬁnd
conditions on the functions γi, i = 0, 1, 2 under which SDE (1.3) has a path-
wise unique solution X, and consequently X is a Markov process. For this
purpose, we only need the functions γi, i = 0, 1, 2 to be locally Lipschitz
because we only consider the solution up to the ﬁrst time of hitting 0 or
explosion.

Theorem 3.1. Suppose that the functions γi, i = 0, 1, 2 are locally Lip-
schitz; i.e., for each closed interval A ⊂ (0, ∞), there is a constant c(A) > 0
so that for any x, y ∈ A,

|γ0(x) − γ0(y)| + |γ1(x) − γ1(y)| + |γ2(x) − γ2(y)| ≤ c(A)|x − y|.

Then

(i) For any initial value X0 = x ≥ 0, there exists a pathwise unique

solution (deﬁned at the beginning of Section 2) to SDE (1.3).

(ii) If in addition, γ2 is an increasing function, then for any y ≥ x ∈ [0, ∞)
t )t≥0 to SDE (1.3) with

t )t≥0 and X y := (X y

and solutions X x := (X x
X x

0 = x and X y

0 = y, we have

P{X y

t ≥ X x
t

for all t ≥ 0} = 1.

Proof. (i) We prove the result by an approximation argument. For each

and X is a solution of (1.3). Since the pathwise uniqueness of the solution
holds for (3.1) in the time interval [0, τ n
n ) for each n ≥ 1, there exists a
pathwise unique solution to (1.3).

(ii) Let (ξx

n(t))t≥0 denote the solution of (3.1) to indicate its dependence
on the initial state. To apply Theorem 2.2 in Dawson and Li (2012), we
identify the notation in Dawson and Li (2012) with that in this paper in the
following equations, where the notation on the left hand sides comes from
Dawson and Li (2012) and that on the right hand sides is from the present
paper.

E = (0, ∞), U0 = (0, ∞)2, π(du) = du, g1(x, z, u) ≡ 0,
µ0(dz, du) = π(dz)du, ˜N0(ds, dz, du) = ˜N (ds, dz, du)

and

b(x) = b1(x) = γn

0 (x), σ(x, u) = 1{u≤γn

1 (x)}, g0(x, z, u) = z1{u≤γn

2 (x)}.

Then conditions (2.a,b,c) in Dawson and Li (2012) are satisﬁed due to the
Lipschitz properties of γn
i

for i = 0, 1, 2. Let

l0(x, y, u) := 1{u≤γ2(x)} − 1{u≤γ2(y)}.

Since the function γ2(x) is non-decreasing in x, then for x < y we have

I(x, y) :=

Similarly, I(x, y) < ∞ for all x ≥ y. Then condition (2.d) of Theorem 2.2
in Dawson and Li (2012) holds. Now for any y ≥ x ≥ 0, by Theorem 2.2

(cid:3)

Throughout the rest of this paper, we always assume that SDE (1.3) has

a unique weak solution which is a Markov process.

Remark 3.2. The solution to SDE (1.3) also arises as the weak limit
in the Skorokhod space D([0, ∞), R+) for a sequence of discrete-state and
continuous-time Markov chains that can be interpreted as discrete-state branch-
ing processes with population dependent branching rates; see Li et al. (2018)
for more details.

4. Foster-Lyapunov criteria for extinction and explosion.

In this
section, we ﬁrst present Foster-Lyapunov criteria type results for the process
X which generalize a similar result for Markov chains; see Chen (2004, p.84).
Let C 2[0, ∞) be the space of twice continuously diﬀerentiable functions

on [0, ∞). Deﬁne the operator L on C 2[0, ∞) by

Lemma 4.1. Given a ≥ 0, let g ∈ C 2[0, ∞) be a non-negative function

satisfying the following conditions:

(i) supy∈[a,b) |Lg(y)| < ∞ for all b > a, i.e., Lg is locally bounded on

[a, ∞);

(ii) supy∈[a,∞) g(y) < ∞;
(iii) g(a) > 0 and limy→∞ g(y) = 0;
(iv) For all b > a, there is a constant db > 0 so that Lg(y) ≥ dbg(y) for all

y ∈ (a, b).

Then for any x > a, we have

(4.1)

Px{τ −

Lemma 4.2. Given 0 < x < b, suppose there exist constants a ∈ [0, x),

d > 0 and a function g ∈ C 2[0, ∞) satisfying the following conditions:

(i) supy∈[a,b] |Lg(y)| < ∞;
(ii) supy∈[a,b) |g(y)| < ∞;
(iii) g(a) = 0 and g(x) > 0;
(iv) Lg(y) ≥ dg(y) for all y ∈ [a, b].

5. Proofs of the main results in Section 2. Recall the deﬁnitions of
Ha and Ga in (2.1) and (2.3), respectively. We now present the martingales
we use to show the main results on extinction, explosion and coming down
from inﬁnity. It is remarkable that such a martingale is enough to show all
the main results in this paper. Some other forms of martingales can only be
used to prove partial results.
