ABSTRACT
A spectroscopic study was carried out on the surface chemical abundances of CNO
and several heavier elements in the primary and secondary components of 5 eclipsing
close binaries around A-type (AR Aur, β Aur, YZ Cas, WW Aur, and RR Lyn),
in order to investigate the nature of chemical diﬀerences between both components
(being comparatively slow rotators alike due to tidal synchronization). Regarding the
systems comprising similar components, β Aur and WW Aur were conﬁrmed to exhibit
no compositional diﬀerence between the primary and secondary both showing almost
the same Am anomaly, though the chemical peculiarities seen in the component stars
of AR Aur show distinct diﬀerences (HgMn star and Am star). In contrast, as to
the systems (YZ Cas and RR Lyn) consisting of considerably diﬀerent (A and early-
F) components, the surface abundances are markedly diﬀerent between the primary
(Am) and secondary (normal). These observational results may indicate Teﬀ-dependent
characteristics regarding the chemical anomalies of non-magnetic stars on the upper
main sequence: (1) In the eﬀective temperature range of 10000K & Teﬀ & 7000K,
rotational velocity is the most important factor for determining the extent of Am
peculiarity. (2) However, the emergence of Am phenomenon seems to have a lower
Teﬀ limit at ∼ 7000 K, below which no abundance anomaly is observed regardless
of stellar rotation. (3) The transition from Am anomaly (mild deﬁciency in CNO) to
HgMn anomaly (unusually large N depletion) is likely to take place as Teﬀ increases
from ∼ 10000 K to ∼ 11000 K.

INTRODUCTION

The nature and origin of chemically peculiar stars (CP stars)
seen in late B through early F type stars of upper main
sequence, which are divided into several subgroups accord-
ing to the type of peculiarity (e.g., Preston 1974), has long
been a matter of debate. Among these, commonly observed
CP phenomena among non-magnetic stars1 are HgMn stars
(mostly seen in late B dwarfs) and Am stars (metallic-lined

1 This term “non-magnetic stars” is used to discriminate them
from those CP stars showing strong magnetic ﬁelds (up to ∼ 103–
104 gauss) as well as speciﬁc abundance anomalies (e.g., over-
abundances of Cr, Sr, or Eu). Recent high-precision polarimetric

A stars, which are widely seen in early-A through early-F
main-sequence stars). Takeda et al. (2018c; hereinafter re-
ferred to as Paper I) very recently carried out an extensive
study of C, N, and O abundances for 100 sample stars (com-
prising normal stars as well as Am/HgMn stars), motivated
by the situation that systematic investigation on these im-
portant light elements had been lacking, and arrived at the
following results:
— (1) Almost all stars (irrespective of being classiﬁed as pe-
culiar or normal, though with a tendency of larger anomaly
for the former) show more or less CNO deﬁcits typically in

observations revealed that weak magnetic ﬁelds do exist even in
Am or HgMn stars.

the range of −1 . [C,N,O/H] . 0; i.e., no stars turned out
to show normal CNO abundances. Besides, distinctly large
deﬁciencies as much as ∼ 2 dex are also shown for C or N by
some CP stars ([C/H] for late Am stars or [N/H] for HgMn
stars of late B-type).
— (2) More useful information could be extracted by con-
centrating on the homogeneous sample of 16 A-type stars be-
longing to the Hyades cluster, which must have the same age
and the same initial composition. In this way, we could con-
ﬁrm the systematic increase of abundance peculiarity with
a decrease in ve sin i (projected rotational velocity), which
manifestly indicates that rotation is the key factor respon-
sible for controlling the extent of Am anomaly.

Therefore, result (1) suggests that CNO abundances are
useful indicators for judging the degree of chemical peculiar-
ity, which are applicable to wide variety of late B through
early F stars regardless of whether or not being classiﬁed
as peculiar. Besides, we learn from result (2) that study-
ing and comparing the abundances of stars sharing homoge-
neous character (e.g., born at the same time with the same
composition) is quite an eﬀective approach for clarifying the
nature of chemical anomaly.

It thus occurred to us to pay attention to the behav-
ior of CNO abundances in the components of double-line
spectroscopic binaries, which must have formed concurrently
from the same gas such as the case of cluster stars. Distinct
merits are also accompanied especially with eclipsing close
binary systems, because stellar parameters (mass M , radius
R, orbital inclination iorb, etc) are well deﬁned. In addition,
since similar rotational velocities are realized for both com-
ponents due to tidal synchronization, we would be able to
check whether any other factor (apart from stellar rotation)
aﬀecting the chemical anomaly exists. Unfortunately, it is
not an easy task to establish the abundances for both com-
ponents of a spectroscopic binary, because lines of two stars
are overlapped in a complex time-variable way depending on
the orbital phase. Actually, such abundance studies of direct
analyzing double-line spectra, which have occasionally been
carried out since old days, are not regarded as suﬃciently
reliable, especially when weak lines are to be measured in a
crowded spectrum.

However, the situation has dramatically changed nowa-
days thanks to progress of spectrum disentangling2 tech-
nique (e.g., Iliji´c 2004 and the references therein), by which
the genuine spectra of primary/secondary can be separately
extracted from a set of double-line spectra suﬃciently cover-
ing various orbital phases, making precise abundance deter-
minations feasible for both components. Nevertheless, past
applications of this technique to studying compositional dif-
ferences of spectroscopic binaries comprising CP stars of late
B through early F-type under question (Am stars, HgMn
stars) are still only a few in number to our knowledge; e.g.,
Folsom et al. (2010) for AR Aur (B9V+B9.6V), Pavlovski et
al. (2014) for YZ Cas (A2IV+F2V), and Torres et al. (2015)

2 Some authors prefer to use the term “disentangling” to specif-
ically imply iterative determination of orbital elements, which re-
quires reliable radial velocities based on appropriately isolated
spectra of both components, while simply using “separation”
if only spectrum reconstruction of each component is involved.
Note, however, that we use “disentangling” in the latter meaning
in this paper.

for V501 Mon (A6m+F0); and besides these studies do not
seem to have paid much attention to CNO abundances of
our interest.

Motivated by this situation, we decided to investigate
the abundances of CNO (as well as several other elements
derived as by-products) and how they diﬀer between the
components for 5 eclipsing binary systems comprising CP
stars (AR Aur, β Aur, YZ Cas, WW Aur, and RR Lyn),
based on the adequately disentangled spectra of the primary
and secondary, in essentially the same manner as done in
Paper I. These 5 systems, which were selected because suﬃ-
cient observational data covering various phases (necessary
for spectrum disentangling) are available, can be divided
into two groups: “similar-component” group (AR Aur with
late-B stars, β Aur with early-A stars, and WW Aur with
mid-A stars) and “diﬀerent-component” group (YZ Cas with
early-A and early-F stars, RR Lyn with late-A and early-F
stars). In what follows are the check points we would like to
elucidate in this study.

• All the component stars of our targets (with spectral
types of late B through early F) are slow rotators (ve ∼ 10–
40 km s−1) because rotation and orbital motion are almost
synchronized in such close binary systems (orbital period
is P ∼ 3–10 day). Then, according to our knowledge, we
may expect that all these stars would more or less exhibit
chemical peculiarities. Could we really conﬁrm this?

• Regarding the systems of “similar-component” group,
almost the same abundances should be observed for both
components according to our naive expectation because dif-
ferences in stelar parameters (including rotational velocities)
are fairly small. What about the observational results on this
point?

• As to the binary systems belonging to “diﬀerent-
component” group, the primary and secondary stars have
distinctly diﬀerent Teﬀ from each other. Could we detect
any compositional diﬀerences between the two? If so, this
may provide us with useful
information regarding Teﬀ -
dependence of chemical peculiarities.

2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA

2.1 Observations

The observations of our 5 program stars (AR Aur, β Aur,
YZ Cas, WW Aur, and RR Lyn; cf. Table 1 for the basic
data) were carried out on 2010 December 14, 15, 16, 18, and
20 by using BOES (Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spec-
trograph) attached to the 1.8 m reﬂector at Bohyunsan Op-
tical Astronomy Observatory. Using 2k×4k CCD (pixel size
of 15 µm × 15 µm), this echelle spectrograph enabled us to
obtain spectra of wide wavelength coverage (from ∼ 3800 ˚A
to ∼ 9200 ˚A). We used 200µm ﬁber corresponding to the
resolving power of R ≃ 45000. The total integration time
for one observation (consisting of 2–3 successive frames to
be co-added) was chosen to be ∼ 10–60 minutes depend-
ing on the brightness of a target. Each of the program stars
were observed 1–3 times in a night with an interval of a few
hours, though the actual frequency diﬀered from star to star.
Thus, as a result of 5-night observations, we could obtain 53
spectra for these 5 targets, which consist of 9–11 spectra per
each star corresponding to diﬀerent observational times. The

fundamental information (spectrum code and observational
time in Julian day) for each of the 53 spectra is presented
in Table 2.

The reduction of the echelle spectra (bias subtraction,
ﬂat ﬁelding, spectrum extraction, wavelength calibration,
and continuum normalization) was carried out by using the
software package IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Fa-
cility).3

It is essential to correctly specify the local radial velocities
for the primary (V local
) corre-
sponding to each spectrum, in order to successfully obtain
the disentangled spectra of both components. For this pur-
pose, we ﬁrst evaluated the predicted V local
at
each relevant observational time as presented in Table 2 (7th
and 8th columns), where we employed the ephemeris data
of primary minimum (taken from the web site of General
Catalogue of Variable Stars4; Samus et al. 2017) and the
orbital elements (taken from the compilation of Eker et al.
2014) summarized in Table 1. Then, we simulated the theo-
retical double-line proﬁle of O i 7771–5 triplet corresponding
to such evaluated V local
and V local
by using the spectrum-
2
synthesis technique, which was further compared with the
observed proﬁle in order to check whether both agree well
with each other. While a satisfactory consistency was con-
ﬁrmed for β Aur, YZ Cas, and WW Aur, small system-
atic diﬀerences (due to slight variation of system velocity?)
were seen for AR Aur and appreciable phase-dependent dis-
agreements (likely to be caused by inadequately computed
phases) were observed for RR Lyn.5 Therefore, we estimated
the empirical radial velocities (V emp
) by directly
comparing the theoretical O i 7771–5 line proﬁles (simulated
for various combinations of V1 and V2) with the observed
one. These various kinds of radial velocities evaluated for
each of the spectra are summarized in Table 2. The radial ve-
locities of both components ﬁnally adopted for disentangling

where the predicted radial velocity curves are also shown for

and RR Lyn (20101214A) corresponding to eclipse phases
were eventually not used, as indicated in Fig. 1 (by arrows)
as well as in Table 2 (by parentheses).

We selected four wavelength regions of 50–60 ˚A width,
for which disentangled spectra of both components are to
be extracted: 5350–5400 ˚A, 6130–6180 ˚A, 7440–7500 ˚A, and
7750–7800 ˚A. The ﬁrst three are obvious because we intend

5 Although we refrain from discussing the reason for the discrep-
ancy, possible anomalies of radial velocity curves have occasion-
ally been mentioned for these two stars. See, e.g., Wilson & Van
Hamme (2014; Sect. 8 and the references therein) for AR Aur and
Tomkin & Fekel (2006; Sect. 6.1 and the references therein) for
RR Lyn.

to determine the abundances of C, N, and O based on C i
5380, N i 7468, and O i 6156–8 lines, closely following Pa-
per I. The inclusion of 7750–7800 ˚A region is to make use of
the O i 7771–5 triplet lines, which are so strong and satu-
rated as to be applied to checking vt (microturbulence) and
to precisely determining ve sin i (cf. Sect. 4.1). Another pa-
rameter necessary to specify for spectrum disentangling is
the luminosity ratio of the primary and secondary (l1 : l2)
relevant for each wavelength region. We computed this ra-
tio by using the emergent continuum ﬂuxes (F1 and F2)
computed from Kurucz’s (1993) ATLAS9 program (corre-
sponding to Teﬀ and log g for each star) and the stellar radii
(R1 and R2) as l1 : l2 = F1R2
2, where the stellar pa-
rameters were taken from Table 1. The resulting luminosity
ratios are summarized in Table 3.

1 : F2R2

Regarding the software tool for spectrum disentangling,
we made use of the public-domain program CRES6 written
by S. Iliji´c, as employed by Takeda, Hashimoto & Honda
(2018b) for their study of Capella’s photospheric abun-
dances. See Sect. 3 of their paper for more details of the
procedures we adopted. We conﬁrmed that the resulting dis-
entangled spectra turned out quite satisfactory. The accom-
plished S/N ratios are suﬃciently high (∼ 300–700), except
for RR Lyn (2) (∼ 100–200) and YZ Cas (2) (∼ 70–90),
as summarized in Table 4. Fig. 2 demonstrates how the
pure primary and secondary spectra could be successfully
extracted from a set of original spectra in the neighborhood
of O i 7771–5. All these disentangled spectra (for 10 stars
and 4 regions) used in this study are presented as on-line
material (ﬁle name: all spectra).

Finally, it should be remarked that our application of
the spectrum disentangling method implicitly assumed that
the line spectra and the brightness of each component did
not show any time variability during the observed period,
despite that the existence of small intrinsic spectrum vari-
ability (caused by chemical inhomogeneity on the surface?)
has been reported for some of our program stars; e.g., for
WW Aur (cf. Kitamura, Kim & Kiyokawa 1976) and AR Aur
(cf. Folsom et al. 2010 and the references therein).

3 ABUNDANCE DETERMINATION

3.1 Atmospheric parameters

Regarding Teﬀ and log g necessary to specify the model at-
mosphere for each star, we adopted the values compiled by
Eker et al. (2014) in this study (cf. Table 1). Here, we should
note that, while these log g values are regarded as fairly pre-
cise (quoted errors are only 0.01–0.03 dex) for these eclipsing
binary stars because M and R are well established, Teﬀ ’s are
the photometry-based values and may not be so accurate.
In Fig. 3 are plotted our 10 program stars on the Teﬀ vs.
log g plane, where theoretical evolutionary tracks of solar-
metallicity stars computed for various M values are also
depicted. We can see from this ﬁgure that the track-based
M is not consistent with the real M for some cases (e.g.,
for WW Aur or RR Lyn), for which Teﬀ errors even larger
than the nominal values (∼ 100–400 K) may be possible.
The microturbulent velocities (vt) were derived from Teﬀ by

Y. Takeda et al.

using the empirical relation [Eq. (1) in Takeda et al. (2008)]
as done in Paper I, though appreciable ambiguities may be
involved with them (cf. Sect. 4.1). In estimating abundance
errors due to uncertainties in atmospheric parameters, we
tentatively assume in this study ±500 K in Teﬀ , ±0.1 dex in
log g, and ±50% in vt. for all stars (which may be regarded
rather as upper limits of actual errors).

3.2 Procedures

The determination of CNO abundances (synthetic spectrum
ﬁtting, evaluation of equivalent widths, error estimation)
was done in essentially the same manner as adopted in Pa-
per I, which should be consulted for the details (cf. Sect. 4
therein). We here remark only some diﬀerences speciﬁc to
this study.

• The O i 7771–5 triplet lines are also analyzed based on
the 7750–7800 ˚A ﬁtting, in a similar manner to the case of
O i 6156–8, though this is mainly for the derivation of ve sin i
as well as for checking vt (rather than for O-abundance de-
termination).

• The wavelength range of spectrum ﬁtting targeting O i
6156–8 lines was extended somewhat shortwards to include
Ba ii 6141 line, in order to get information of Ba abundance.
• We make use of the abundances of various elements
other than CNO (speciﬁcally, Na, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ba),
which are derived as by-products of spectrum ﬁtting (though
under the assumption of LTE), since they also serve as useful
indicators of chemical peculiarities.

The details of spectrum ﬁtting analysis (wavelength
range, source of line data, varied abundances) done for four
regions are presented in Table 5, and the basic atomic data
of C i 5380, N i 7468, O i 6156–8, and O i 7771–5 lines
are summarized in Table 6. The accomplished consistency
between the theoretical spectrum (for the converged solu-
tions) and the observed spectrum as a result of our ﬁtting
analysis is displayed in Fig. 4–7 for each region. In Fig. 8
are plotted the resulting equivalent width (W ), non-LTE
correction (∆), and non-LTE abundance (AN) for each of
these CNO lines against Teﬀ , just like Fig. 5–7 of Paper I.
More complete results of these CNO abundances (including
errors and related quantities) and the abundances of other
elements (Na, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ba) resulting from spec-
trum ﬁtting as by-products are presented as online material
(ﬁlename: abundances.dat). Besides, the abundances of Na,
Si, Ca, and Ti for 100 A-type main-sequence stars targeted
in Paper I, which were not published therein because the
main focus was placed only on CNO, are also given as on-
line material (ﬁlename: paperI suppl.dat) for reference.

3.3 Impact of errors in the luminosity ratio

Here, as an additional error source speciﬁc to this study,
it may be worth mentioning the eﬀect of uncertainties in
the luminosity ratio adopted for spectrum disentangling (cf.
Sect. 2.2), since the emergent ﬂux (F ) would suﬀer some
ambiguities due to errors in Teﬀ (typically by a few hundred
K; cf. Sect. 3.1), although the radii (R) of both stars are
precisely determined. Since F is changed by ∼ 20–30% for
an increase in Teﬀ by 1000 K, errors of several to . 10%

may be possible in the computed luminosity. As a test trial,
we carried out spectrum disentangling in the 6130–6180 ˚A
region by increasing the l1/l2 ratio by 10% (e.g., 0.542:0.458
instead of 0.518:0.482 for AR Aur or 0.793:0.207 instead of
0.777:0.223 for RR Lyn), and determined the abundances
of O, Na, Si, Ca, Fe, and Ba in the same manner based on
such specially reconstructed spectra with intentionally in-
creased l1/l2. Comparing the resulting abundances with the
standard values, we found that the diﬀerences are generally
insigniﬁcant (typically several hundredths dex), except for
the strong/deep line cases of Ba or Ca (cf. Fig 6) where
more appreciable abundance changes of ∼ 0.1–0.15 dex are
seen (especially for YZ Cas (2) and RR Lyn (2)). This
may be interpreted as due to the fact that an error in the
zero-point level of the residual intensity, which is caused
by inappropriately chosen luminosity ratio, signiﬁcantly af-
fects deep/strong lines but not shallow/weak lines (see foot-
note 12 in Takeda, Hashimoto, & Honda 2018b). Accord-
ingly, as far as the abundances of C, N, and O derived from
C i 5380, N i 7468, and O i 6156–8 lines (our main objective
which we will discuss in Sect. 4.2) are concerned, this kind
of error is of negligible importance, because these lines are
suﬃciently weak.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Microturbulence and rotation

We start by mentioning about the stellar parameters (vt and
ve sin i) related to O i 7771–5 triplet, which was specially
analyzed in this study.

77) and weak O i 6156–8 lines (AN

Regarding the microturbulence, we simply applied the
empirical Teﬀ -dependent analytical
formula proposed by
Takeda et al. (2008), as done in Paper I. A useful test for ex-
amining the adequacy of such assumed vt is to check whether
the non-LTE oxygen abundances derived from strong O i
7771–5 lines (AN
61) agree
with each other, because the former is appreciably vt-
sensitive while the latter is not. Such a comparison is dis-
played in Fig. 9a, indicating that AN
77 tends to be some-
what larger than AN
61 (this diﬀerence is also recognized by
comparing Fig. 8c and Fig. 8d). We can determine the
“abundance-matched” microturbulence vt(A) by requiring
the abundance equality (AN
77 = AN
61; cf. Fig 9b). These vt(A)
values are plotted against Teﬀ in Fig. 9c, which shows that
these values are somewhat larger than the analytical relation
we adopted (as expected). For reference, we also derived the
“proﬁle-based” microturbulence vt(P), which was so deter-
mined as to accomplish the best-ﬁt O i 7771–5 triplet line
proﬁle (cf. Sect. 5 in Takeda, Jeong & Han 2018a). Such
obtained vt(P) results are depicted in Fig. 9d, where we see
that vt(P) tends to become higher than the adopted relation
at Teﬀ . 8000 K. Taking all these results into considera-
tion, we conservatively assumed that uncertainties of ±50%
may be involved with the vt values adopted in this study,
as mentioned in Sect. 3.1. Fortunately, the CNO abundances
derived from C i 5380, N i 7468, and O i 6156–8 lines (which
are all quite weak) are hardly aﬀected by any choice of
vt, though abundances from stronger saturated lines (e.g.,
Ba abundance from Ba ii 6141 line) are considerably vt-
dependent.

Since the O i 7771–5 triplet is almost free from blending
with other lines and shows a characteristic proﬁle compris-
ing three component lines (which sometimes show a complex
substructure by merging of rotationally broadened proﬁles;
see, e.g., Fig. 7b or Fig. 7d), precise determination of ve sin i
may be expected if successful ﬁtting between theoretical and
observed proﬁles could be accomplished. Such spectroscop-
ically established ve sin i values (presented in Table 1) can
be used to check whether the expected synchronization of
rotational and orbital motions are actually realized in these
close binary systems. Assuming the alignment of orbital and
rotational axes, we can derive the observed equatorial rota-
tion velocity (ve) by dividing ve sin i by the sinus of orbital
inclination (iorb). The comparison of such obtained ve with
Vsyn (≡ 2πR/P : synchronized rotation velocity) is shown in
Fig. 10a, where can see that the agreement is mostly sat-
isfactory. This suggests that synchronization is almost re-
alized in these close binary systems, which lends support
to the result of Kitamura & Kondo (1978) who arrived at
practically the same conclusion. However, the situation is
indeﬁnite regarding the comparatively longer period case
of RR Lyn (P ≃ 10 day), where ve is apparently larger
than Vsyn by ∼ 20–40% (cf. Fig. 10b). This might indicate
that co-rotation has not yet been realized in this system.
Alternatively, we can not rule out a possibility of overes-
timated ve sin i for such a sharp-lined star (∼ 10 km s−1)
due to our neglect of some signiﬁcant broadening compo-
nent (e.g., macroturbulence), although the eﬀect of instru-
mental broadening (corresponding to the spectrum resolving
power of R ≃ 45000) was taken into consideration in deriv-
ing ve sin i.

4.2 Abundance characteristics

We now discuss the abundances of 10 stars (primary and
secondary of 5 systems) resulting from our analysis. Regard-
ing oxygen, we exclusively use the abundance derived from
O i 6156–8 lines (as done in Paper I), because the abun-
dance from O i 7771–5 is sensitive to vt and suﬀers a large
non-LTE eﬀect. The diﬀerential abundances relative to the
standard star Procyon7 ([X/H]; X is any of C, N, O, Na,
Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ba) for each star are summarized in Ta-
ble 7 and graphically plotted in Fig. 11. We can read from
this ﬁgure several characteristic trends in terms of the check
points set up in Sect. 1.
— Regarding the systems belonging to “similar component”
group (AR Aur, β Aur, WW Aur), the abundances of the
primary and secondary components are very similar and
hardly discernible for β Aur and WW Aur, while those for
AR Aur are apparent diﬀerent. More precisely, both com-
ponents of β Aur and WW Aur show the characteristics of
Am phenomena: C/N/O are deﬁcient by several tenths to
. 1 dex (cf. Paper I), Si/Na/Ti/Fe are normal/enriched,
Ca is normal/underabundant, and Ba is conspicuously over-
abundant (see, e.g., Fig. 9 in Varenne & Monier 1999). In
contrast, the primary component of AR Aur shows a clear
characteristics of HgMn stars (this star is actually known to

be of this type) in the sense that N is drastically depleted
by & 2 dex, whereas the secondary appears to exhibit some
weak Am phenomenon as seen from moderate deﬁciencies of
CNO and large overabundance of Ba.
— As for YZ Cas and RR Lyn belonging to “diﬀerent-
component” systems, the surface composition of the hot-
ter primary is appreciably diﬀerent from that of the cooler
secondary. That is, the former shows clear Am-type pecu-
liarities mentioned above, while the latter is nearly normal
within a few tenths dex without showing any conspicuous
anomaly despite of slow rotators. It is worth noting that
these normal-composition secondary stars of YZ Cas and
RR Lyn are at Teﬀ . 7000 K.

Combining these observational facts, we can draw the
following consequences regarding the appearance and prop-
erties of chemical peculiarities in late B through early F
stars.

• The fact that essentially the same Am peculiarities are
observed between the similar primary and secondary (quite
similar ve sin i and only small Teﬀ diﬀerence of ∼ 200–300 K)
for both β Aur and WW Aur means that Am phenomenon
is mainly determined by ve sin i and not very sensitive to Teﬀ
as far as the Teﬀ range of 10000K & Teﬀ & 7000K is con-
cerned. This is a reconﬁrmation of the primary importance
of rotational velocity in the appearance of Am anomalies,
though their extents show moderate Teﬀ -dependences (e.g.,
tendency of larger CNO deﬁciency towards lower Teﬀ ).

• In the context of essentially same chemical composi-
tions between the primary and secondary for β Aur and
WW Aur, it is interesting to note that these two systems
show markedly diﬀerent Na as well as Ca abundances from
each other (cf. Fig. 11b,d). We consider that this discrep-
ancy is mainly due to the diﬀerence in Teﬀ (by ∼ 1500 K),
since [Na/H] and [Ca/H] tend to decrease with a lowering of
Teﬀ as can be recognized in Fig. 12, where the [Na/H] and
[Ca/H] values of 100 A-type stars studied in Paper I are plot-
ted against Teﬀ . Likewise, diﬀusion calculation predicts the
similar tendency at least for Ca (see, e.g., Fig. 14 in Richer,
Michaud & Turcotte 2000). Although these two stars have
distinctly diﬀerent ages, ∼ 450–500 Myr for β Aur (South-
worth, Bruntt & Buzasi 2007) and ∼ 90 Myr for WW Aur
(Southworth et al. 2005), it seems rather unlikely that this
has caused the abundance diﬀerence, because Ca is consid-
erably deﬁcient in younger WW Aur while nearly normal in
older β Aur (i.e., in conﬂict with the naive expectation that
chemical anomaly would develop with time).

• The apparent abundance diﬀerence between AR Aur (1)
(HgMn star) and AR Aur (2) (weak Am star) despite their
similarity in stellar parameters (essentially the same rota-
tional velocity and only a small Teﬀ diﬀerence of 600 K)
is somewhat strange. It may be possible that a rather dis-
tinct transition occurs somewhere in-between Teﬀ ∼ 10000–
11000 K regarding the chemical peculiarity of slow rotators;
i.e., from Am-type to HgMn-type as Teﬀ is increased.

• The chemical composition diﬀerence between the
primary (Am) and the secondary (normal)
seen in
YZ Cas (Teﬀ,1/Teﬀ,2 = 9200 K/6700 K) and RR Lyn
(7570 K/6980 K) provides us with important information
concerning the Teﬀ -dependence for the appearance of Am
stars. Especially, the distinct transition from Am to normal
over a small Teﬀ diﬀerence of ∼ 600 K for the case of RR Lyn

6

is signiﬁcant. We can state from these facts that the advent
of Am phenomenon is conﬁned to Teﬀ & 7000 K, below
which chemical peculiarities do not appear no matter how
slowly a star rotates. Actually, we can see from Fig. 8e–8g
of Paper I that the large spread of C, N, and O abundance
deﬁciencies tend to quickly shrink at Teﬀ ∼ 7000 K. This is
presumably related to the thickening of surface convection
zone counteracting the formation of chemical anomaly.

Further, in order to visualize these abundance charac-
teristics summarized above, we plot in Fig. 13 the values of
[C/H], [N/H], and [O/H] for the 10 program stars as well
as those of 100 stars (Hyades stars and ﬁeld stars) taken
from Paper I altogether against Teﬀ and ve sin i. It can be
recognized from this ﬁgure that the CNO abundances of
the close binary stars are more or less consistent with the
results for general A-type stars. Especially, our results (ex-
cept for YZ Cas (2) and RR Lyn (2), which are normal
abundance stars at Teﬀ . 7000 K) reasonably follow the
systematic [X/H] vs. ve sin i trend established by Hyades
stars (small open circles) despite the narrow range of ve sin i
(∼ 10–40 km s−1), which reaﬃrms the importance of rota-
tional velocity for the build-up of Am peculiarity.

4.3 Comparison with previous studies

Finally, we brieﬂy comment on how the results derived from
our spectroscopic analysis of 5 binary systems are compared
with similar chemical abundance studies published so far.
Here, focus of attention is placed on whether or not these
previous investigations are consistent with our consequences.

4.3.1 AR Aur

Khokhlova et al. (1995) concluded in their chemical abun-
dance study of AR Aur for 18 elements (based on the line
strengths of each component carefully measured from the
double-lined spectra of various phases) that the primary is
a typical HgMn star while the secondary is also abnormal
but with diﬀerent type of peculiarity. Similarly, according
to Folsom et al.’s (2010) more recent investigation based on
the disentangled spectra of AR Aur, the surface chemical
compositions of the primary and secondary are apparently
diﬀerent, indicating that the former is a HgMn star and
the latter is a weak Am star (cf. Fig. 4 therein). Therefore,
our conclusion is almost consistent with these past studies.
Although Folsom et al. (2010) reported that the C and O
abundances are nearly solar for both components (in con-
trast to our result of mild but deﬁnite deﬁciency), this may
be partly due to their neglect of the non-LTE eﬀect.

4.3.2 β Aur

Lyubimkov, Rachkovskaya & Rostopchin (1996) determined
the chemical compositions of the primary and secondary
stars of β Aur by analyzing the double-lined spectra, and
concluded that the abundances of both components are quite
similar and show the characteristics of Am stars. The abun-
dance characteristics of various elements (including CNO)
reported by them are in satisfactory agreement with our re-
sults.

4.3.3 YZ Cas

Pavlovski et al. (2014) recently carrird out chemical abun-
dance determinations separately for each of the components
of YZ Cas based on the disentangled spectra. They reported
that the primary is an Am star with supersolar abundances
(except for Sc) while the composition of secondary is nearly
solar, which is almost consistent with our conclusion. How-
ever, their results of “supersolar” C and O abundances (like
other heavier elements) for the Am primary are in serious
conﬂict with the general trend of CNO deﬁciency conﬁrmed
in Paper I as well as in this study. Unfortunately, since they
did not publish any details of their analysis (e.g., used lines,
equivalent widths), we have no idea about the reason for this
discrepancy.

4.3.4 WW Aur

To our knowledge, no chemical abundance study for this
binary system has ever been published so far. Although
Pavlovski, Southworth & Tamajo (2008) once reported
their accomplishment of spectrum disentangling applied to
WW Aur, stating that the related abundance analysis was
in progress, their successive paper does not seem to have
come out yet.

4.3.5 RR Lyn

Several spectroscopic investigations have already been pub-
lished since old days regarding the chemical abundances
of RR Lyn (Popper 1971; Kondo 1976; Burkhart &
Coupry 1991; Lyubimkov & Rachkovskaya 1995; Hui-Bon-
Hoa 2000), although all these are based on the direct analysis
of double-lined spectra. According to these previous studies,
the primary component is an Am star and more metal-rich
than the secondary, which is in reasonable consistency with
our consequence. However, none of them mentioned about
the CNO abundances of this binary system.

5 CONCLUSION

Spectroscopically investigating the chemical compositions
separately for the primary and secondary components of a
double-line eclipsing binary showing characteristic chemical
peculiarities (typically seen in A-tye stars in the upper main
sequence) is of profound signiﬁcance, since it may provide us
with information regarding how the appearance of chemical
anomaly depends upon stellar physical parameters.

We conducted a spectroscopic study to determine the
surface chemical abundances of CNO and other heavier ele-
ments in the primary and secondary components of selected
5 eclipsing close binaries around A-type (AR Aur, β Aur,
YZ Cas, WW Aur, and RR Lyn). Our aim was to inves-
tigate whether any chemical diﬀerence exists between two
components, and how the situation depends upon stellar pa-
rameters.

For this purpose, we extracted the individual spectra of
the primary and secondary for each target in 4 wavelength
regions by applying the spectrum disentangling method to
a set of time-series spectra suﬃciently covering the orbital
phases, which were obtained by using the high-dispersion

echelle spectrograph attached to the 1.8 m reﬂector of Bo-
hyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory.

The abundances of C, N, and O were determined by us-
ing C i 5380, N i 7468, and O i 6156–8 lines in essentially the
same manner (spectrum-synthesis analysis by taking into ac-
count the non-LTE eﬀect) as done in Paper I. Besides, we
could also derive the abundances of Na, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and
Ba as by-products of spectrum ﬁtting.

In addition, we also analyzed the O i 7771–5 triplet
lines in the same way, with an aim to check the adopted
vt and to determine ve sin i for each star. We could conﬁrm
that synchronization between rotation and orbital motion is
accomplished for almost all systems, except for RR Lyn for
which the situation is unclear.

Regarding the “similar-component” systems, β Aur and
WW Aur were conﬁrmed to exhibit the characteristics of
Am anomaly (deﬁciency in CNO, overabundance of heavy
elements such as Ba) with essentially the same compositions
for both the primary and secondary.

However, distinct compositional diﬀerences were found
between the primary and secondary of AR Aur, another
“similar-component” system, in the sense that they show
chemical anomalies of diﬀerent types (HgMn star and Am
star, respectively).

In contrast, as to YZ Cas and RR Lyn, both of which are
the “diﬀerent-component” systems consisting of A-type and
early-F stars, the surface abundances turned out markedly
diﬀerent between the primary (Am star) and secondary
(chemically normal).

These observational results may indicate the Teﬀ -
dependent nature in the chemical anomalies of non-magnetic
stars on the upper main sequence, as summarized below.
—(i) In the eﬀective temperature range of 10000K & Teﬀ &
7000K, slow rotation is considered to be the key factor for
the appearance of Am anomaly. Thus, the components of
close binaries (slow rotators due to tidal braking) naturally
exhibit very similar Am anomalies under the same rotational
velocities (β Aur and WW Aur).
—(ii) However, the emergence of Am peculiarity seems to
have a distinct lower Teﬀ limit at ∼ 7000 K, below which
abundance anomaly can hardly be produced regardless of
stellar rotation (secondary components of RR Lyn and
YZ Cas).
—(iii) On the other hand, as seen from the abundance dif-
ferences between the components of AR Aur, the transition
from Am anomaly to HgMn anomaly is likely to take place
(with an increase in Teﬀ ) somewhere between ∼ 10000 K
and ∼ 11000 K.

Following columns 3–5 (laboratory wavelength, lower excitation potential, and log gf value), three kinds of damping parameters are
presented in columns 6–8: Gammar is the radiation damping width (s−1) [log γrad], Gammas is the Stark damping width (s−1) per electron
density (cm−3) at 104 K [log(γe/Ne)], and Gammaw is the van der Waals damping width (s−1) per hydrogen density (cm−3) at 104 K
[log(γw/NH)].
All the data were taken from Kurucz & Bell (1995), except for the parenthesized damping parameters (unavailable in their compilation),
for which the default values computed by Kurucz’s (1993) WIDTH9 program were assigned.

the ﬁttings of 5375–5390 ˚A, 6140–6168 ˚A, 7457–7472 ˚A, and 7765–7785 ˚A. (10) LTE Ba abundance derived from 6140–6168 ˚A ﬁtting.
Regarding the data given for the primary of AR Aur, the parenthesized value for N is the upper limit, while the value for C with colon (:)
is considered to suﬀer a large uncertainty.

Figure 8. (a) C i 5380-related quantities plotted against Teﬀ : W5380 (equivalent width), ∆5380 (non-LTE
correction), and AN(C) (non-LTE logarithmic number abundance of C expressed in the usual normaliza-
tion of AH = 12). The error bars in AN(C) are the combined uncertainties due to those of atmospheric
parameters and photometric errors (cf. Sect. 4.3 in Paper I). The codes attached to the symbols are almost
self-explanatory; e.g., A1 is AR Aur (1), B2 is β Aur (2), or Y2 is YZ Cas (2). The reference AN(C) value for
the standard star Procyon is shown by the horizontal dashed line. (b) Similar to panel (a) but for N i 7460.
(c) Similar to panel (a) but for O i 6156–8. (d) Similar to panel (a) but for O i 7771–5. Note that the open
symbols in panel (a) indicate the results with considerably large uncertainties and the downward arrow in
panel (b) means the upper limit, which correspond to C and N abundances for AR Aur (1), respectively.

Figure 9. (a) Comparison of two kinds of non-LTE oxygen abundances (relative to Procyon) derived from
O i 7771–5 and O i 6156–8 lines. (b) Examples of how vt(A) (microturbulence derived by requiring the
abundance consistency between [O/H]N
61) can be determined, shown for the cases of AR Aur (2)
and RR Lyn (1). (c) Such determined “abundance-matched” vt(A) results plotted against Teﬀ . (d) The values
of vt(P) (“proﬁle-based” microturbulence derived from the proﬁle-ﬁtting of O i 7771-5 lines) plotted against
Teﬀ . Since the vt(P) solutions for AR Aur (2) and RR Lyn (2) did not converge showing oscillatory behaviors,
only the rough (mean) values are shown only for reference, as indicated by parentheses. The dashed line
shown in panels (c) and (d) is the vt vs. Teﬀ relation adopted in this study.

as in Fig. 3) with those of 100 A-type stars derived in Paper 1 (small symbols; where Hyades stars are
denoted by small open circles, while others are by gray dots). In the left (a–c) and right (d–f) panels are
plotted the results against ve sin i and Teﬀ , while the top (a, d), middle (b, e), and bottom (c, f) panels
correspond to [C/H], [N/H], and [O/H], respectively. In the left panels (a)–(c), RR Lyn (2) and YZ Cas (2)
are denoted as R2 and Y2, in order to remark that these two are normal abundance stars.
