u , and triplet states, 3Σ+

Liquid argon is used as active medium in a variety of neutrino and Dark Matter experiments
thanks to its excellent properties of charge yield and transport and as a scintillator. Liquid argon
scintillation photons are emitted in a narrow band of 10 nm centered around 127 nm and with
a characteristic time proﬁle made by two components originated by the decay of the lowest lying
singlet, 1Σ+
2 to the dissociative ground state. A model
is proposed which takes into account the quenching of the long lived triplet states through the
self-interaction with other triplet states or through the interaction with molecular Ar+
2 ions. The
model predicts the time proﬁle of the scintillation signals and its dependence on the intensity of
an external electric ﬁeld and on the density of deposited energy, if the relative abundance of the
unquenched fast and slow components is know. The model successfully explains the experimentally
observed dependence of the characteristic time of the slow component on the intensity of the applied
electric ﬁeld and the increase of photon yield of liquid argon when doped with small quantities of
xenon (at the ppm level). The model also predicts the dependence of the pulse shape parameter,
Fprompt, for electron and nuclear recoils on the recoil energy and the behavior of the relative light
yield of nuclear recoils in liquid argon, Lef f .

INTRODUCTION

Liquid Argon (LAr) is a powerful medium to detect
ionizing particles and is widely used in neutrino and Dark
Matter experiments since several years [1], [2], [3], [4], [5],
[6]. LAr scintillation photons are emitted in the Vacuum
Ultra Violet in a 10 nm band centered around 127 nm
with a time proﬁle made by two components with very
diﬀerent characteristic decay times, a fast one in the
nanosecond range and a slower one in the microsecond
range [7]. The relative abundance of the two compo-
nents depends strongly on the ionizing particle type and
allows for a powerful particle discrimination [8] [9]. LAr
scintillation has been deeply studied by several authors
[7], [10], [11] and a solid understanding of the main mech-
anisms regulating the production, emission and propaga-
tion of scintillation photons has been achieved. However,
there are experimental results which can not be easily
explained and described by the currently accepted mod-
els, as the dependence of the characteristic time of the
slow component on the intensity of the electric ﬁeld ap-
plied to LAr and the increase of the LAr photon yield
when doped with small quantities of xenon, at the level
of few ppm (part per million). These phenomena point
to quenching mechanisms involving the excited species
which are the precursors of the scintillation photons and
which have not been investigated before.
The model proposed in this work takes into account these
quenching processes and predicts the shape of the scintil-
lation pulse as a function of the applied electric ﬁeld and
of the density of the energy transferred to the electrons of
LAr. In addition to the experimental observations men-
tioned above, it also allows to explain the dependence

∗ segreto@iﬁ.unicamp.br

of the pulse shape parameter, Fprompt, on the energy of
the incoming particle. The cases of electron and nuclear
recoils are explicitly treated and compared to data.
The integral of the scintillation pulse allows to estimate
the amount of quenching due to these processes and to
predict the behavior of the relative light yield of nuclear
recoils in LAr, Lef f , as a function of the recoil energy,
which is a quantity of central importance for Dark Matter
experiments.

II. LAR SCINTILLATION MODEL

2, or ionized, Ar+

The passage of ionizing particles in LAr produces
free excitons and electron-hole pairs. The proportion
between these two species is assumed to be independent
of the ionizing particle type and energy: Nex/Ni = 0,21,
where Nex is the abundance of excitons and Ni the abun-
dance of electron-hole pairs. Free excitons and holes are
self-trapped within about 1 ps from their production and
result into excited, Ar∗
2 , argon dimers.
Ar+
2 recombines with a thermalized electron to form Ar∗
2
[10] which in turn decays non-radiatively to the ﬁrst
singlet and triplet excited states 1Σ+
u . These
two states, whose dis-excitation leads to the emission of
the scintillation photons, have approximately the same
energy with respect to the dissociative ground state,
while the lifetimes are very diﬀerent: in the nanosecond
range for 1Σ+
u [7].
The scintillation photon yield of LAr depends on the
ionizing particle type and on the Linear Energy Transfer
(LET) [12]. The highest photon yield is reached by
relativistic heavy nuclei, from Ne to La. Low LET light
particles (e−, p) have a slightly reduced photon yield
due to the fact that a fraction of the ionization electrons
escapes from recombination. Nuclear recoils and α parti-

cles also have a reduced photon yield, but the quenching
mechanism is diﬀerent and not fully clariﬁed yet. A
bi-excitonic interaction in the core of the track has been
proposed as a possible explanation [10] and a reasonably
good agreement is found for 5,3 MeV α particles, while
the model is not accurate in explaining the dependence
of the photon yield for nuclear recoils [11] at very low
energies (∼ tens of keV). In this case, a better agreement
with the available data is obtained when using the
Birks law to account for the possible quenching pro-
cesses involving excitons and excited dimers Ar∗
2 [13] [14].

Two recent experimental observations can not be eas-
ily explained with the current understanding of the LAr
scintillation process. The DUNE (Deep Underground
Neutrino Experiment) Collaboration has reported a clear
dependence of the lifetime of the triplet state 3Σ+
u of the
Ar∗
2 dimer on the electric ﬁeld in which the LAr is im-
mersed [15]. The scintillation light was produced by a
sample of cosmic muons crossing one of the prototypes
of the dual phase DUNE detector, the 4-ton demonstra-
tor [16]. The light was detected with an array of ﬁve
8” photomultipliers (Hamamatsu R5912-02Mod) coated
with a wavelength shifter, TetraPhenyl-Butadiene (TPB)
[17], to convert the 127 nm photons to 430 nm and the
electric ﬁeld was varied between 0 and 600 V/cm.
The second experimental evidence is related to the dop-
ing of LAr with small concentrations of xenon.
It has
been reported that adding a few tens of ppm of xenon
to LAr has the eﬀect of shifting the wavelength of the
triplet component from 127 nm to 174 nm, shortening
the signal from few µsec to hundreds of nsec and enhanc-
ing the Light Yield (LY) [9]. The enhancement of LY can
not be explained by an higher quantum eﬃciency of the
wavelength shifter (TPB) for 174 nm than for 127 nm,
since it has been measured to be almost the same [18]
and should be attributed to an increase of the LAr pho-
ton yield.
These two eﬀects point to quenching processes of the
triplet states and to an hidden amount of light which
has not been described before. The proposed quenching
mechanisms for the triplet states are two: one relies on
the interaction of two excited dimers Ar∗
2 and the other
on the interaction of one ionized dimer Ar+
2 with one
excited dimer Ar∗

is the relative velocity between a triplet excimer and a
ion, σ3 is the cross section for process 1 and v3 is the
relative velocity of two Ar∗

In the hypotheses that the diﬀusion terms can be ne-
glected and that Ar∗
2 are uniformly distributed
inside a cylinder of radius r3 along the track, equations
3 and 4 reduce to one, which depends only on time:

where N0 is the initial density of triplet states, λq =

is the decay time of the singlet states, α3 is the initial
abundance of triplet states, τ3 is the unquenched decay
time of the triplet states, and τq = 1/(λ3 + k+)=1/λq.
The probability density of triplet states depends on the
electric ﬁeld and on the LET thorough τq and q. The in-
tegral, L, of the probability density l(t), which is propor-
tional to the total number of scintillation photons emit-
ted, is given by:

In the absence of an external electric ﬁeld, reaction 2 is
possible when escaping electrons prevent the complete
recombination of the ionization charge and thus only for
low LET particles (electrons, muons, protons, . . . ).
It is assumed that only the excited dimers in the triplet
state participate to this quenching processes, since the
lifetime of the singlet state is too short. The instanta-

been analyzed were collected during the test described in
[8], [19]. Within the R&D program of the WArP exper-
iment [3] a 4 liters single phase LAr chamber, observed
by seven 2” photomultipliers (ETL D749U), was exposed
to neutron (AmBe) and γ sources. The internal sur-
faces of the LAr chamber were coated with TetraPhenyl-
Butadiene (TPB) [20] to down-convert the 127 nm LAr
scintillation photons to 430 nm making them detectable
by the photomultipliers. After a selection of the events
based on the shape of the signals, electron and nuclear
recoil average waveforms were calculated for diﬀerent in-
tervals of deposited energy. The LY of the detector was
measured to be 1,52 phel/keV (photo-electrons/keV) for
the considered run. An average electron recoil waveform,
calculated with signals containing between 130 and 150
phel, and an average nuclear recoil waveform, calculated
with signals containing between 150 and 180 phel, have
been simultaneously ﬁtted. Considering the LY of the
detector these correspond to an energy interval of 85 to
100 keV and of 220 to 290 keV respectively. The ﬁt func-
tion contains the amplitudes of the singlet and triplet
components (αs and α3), the decay time of the singlet
component (τs), the unquenched decay time of the triplet
component (τ3) and the rate constants k+ and q. An
additional time component, with a decay time around
50 nsec, is included to take into account the late light re-
emission of TPB [17] with a constant abundance with
respect to the singlet component. The light signal is
convoluted with a Gaussian function to accomodate the
statistical ﬂuctuations and the response of the read-out
electronics.
The parameters which are assumed to be common to the
electron and nuclear recoil waveforms are the decay time
of the singlet component (τs), the unquenched decay time
of the triplet component (τ3) and the fraction of TPB late
light, while the other parameters are assumed to be par-
ticle dependent. The result of the ﬁt is shown in ﬁgure
1. The main parameters of the ﬁt are reported in table
I.

IV. DEPENDENCE OF THE SLOW DECAY
TIME FROM THE ELECTRIC FIELD AT LOW
LET

The shape of the LAr scintillation waveform depends
on the module of the applied electric ﬁeld, E, through
the parameters k and q (see equation 7). The charge
recombination factor, R(E), is assumed to have the form:

R(E) = B +

A
1 + KE/E

(9)

where B takes into account the fraction of the charge
which does not recombine even at null electric ﬁeld, due
to escaping electrons, kE is the Birks recombination con-
stant and A is a normalization constant [21].

Equation 9 can be used to make explicit the depen-
0 , and of the initial

V. XENON DOPING OF LAR

It is known that adding xenon to LAr at the level of
ppm (part per million) has the eﬀect of shifting the wave-
length of the slow scintillation component from 127 nm
to 174 nm [9]. The complete shift of the slow component
is observed at tens of ppm of xenon concentration. It has
been also reported an increase of the number of detected
photons with increasing xenon concentration, which can
not be explained with an increase of the conversion ef-
ﬁciency of the TPB, the wavelength shifter used in the
experiment, which has been measured to be almost the
same at 127 nm and 174 nm [22].
The mechanism suggested in [23] for the transfer of the
excitation energy from argon to xenon can be summa-
rized with the following reaction chain:

Ar∗
(ArXe)∗ + Xe → Xe∗

2 + Xe → (ArXe)∗ + Ar
2 + Ar

(15)
(16)

The energy transfer process and the subsequent emis-
sion of 174 nm photons compete with the radiative decay
of the Ar∗
2 and with the quenching processes described in
section II. The net eﬀect is the shift of the slow LAr
scintillation component and the partial recovery of the
quenched LAr species, which both result in the emission
of 174 nm photons with peculiar time characteristics.
In order to understand the gross features of the light
emission process from a xenon-argon mixture in the case
of low LET particles, it is worth making some rough ap-
proximations. For a high enough Xe concentration, it
should be possible to neglect second order quenching ef-
fects, such as Ar∗
2-(ArXe)∗, (ArXe)∗-(ArXe)∗.
Assuming that the energy transfer between argon and
xenon happens without losses and that the reaction rates
of the processes Ar∗
2 + Xe → (ArXe)∗ and (ArXe)∗ + Xe
→ Xe∗
2 are the same and equal to kXe, the instantaneous
variation of the density of triplet argon states, NAr
3 (t), of
2 dimers, NXe(t) [24] and of mixed dimers (ArXe)∗,

NArXe(t) can be written as:

The measurement of the variation of the slow decay time
of the LAr scintillation light as a function of the applied
electric ﬁeld, reported in [15], represents, substantially,
a measurement of the electron-ion recombination process
in LAr performed with light. Experimental points taken
from [15] are shown in ﬁgure 2. They have been ﬁtted
with the function of equation 14, leaving the parameters
α, β and kE free and the result is shown with a ma-
genta line. The agreement between data and the model
is pretty good, with the exception of one of the points at
very low electric ﬁeld. The ﬁt procedure returns a value

tual conversion of fast (and slow) LAr scintillation light
through photo-absorption by xenon atoms. This would
lead to the formation of (ArXe)∗ which would evolve in
Xe∗

2 according to reaction 16.
The variation of the total LY, which includes 127 nm
and 174 nm photons, predicted by the model is shown
in ﬁgure 4 together with the experimental data shown
in [9]. Both model prediction and data have been nor-
malized by their value at zero xenon concentration. An
increase of the overall LY around 25% for concentrations
above few tens of ppm in mass is observed in the data
and correctly predicted by the model. It is reasonable to
conclude that the two main approximations made: ne-
glecting second order quenching eﬀects and assuming a
lossless transfer of energy between xenon and argon are
small and compensate with each other, leading to a good
description of the experimental data. The ﬁrst approxi-
mation would lead to an increase of LY, since the amount
of quenched Ar∗
2 would be higher, while the second would
lead to a decrease of LY, because of possible non-radiative
dis-excitations of the (ArXe)∗ states.

VI. F-PROMPT FOR ELECTRON AND
NUCLEAR RECOILS

LAr allows for a powerful particle discrimination based
on the shape of its scintillation signal. In particular, the
relative abundances of fast and slow components strongly
depend on the particle type [7]. This property of LAr is
crucial for discarding gamma and electron backgrounds

tion. Assuming that λXe (cid:29) kXe[Xe], equations 17, 18
and 19 can be easily solved with the initial condition
that NArXe(0) = 0 and give the probability density for
the slow LAr scintillation component, l3(t), and for Xe
shifted light, lXe(t):

(21)

where τr = 1/(kXe[Xe] + 1/τq) and τd = 1/kXe[Xe].
The probability density for all the emitted photons, re-
gardless of their wavelength, can be obtained by sum-
ming the contributions of equations 20 and 21 to the fast
LAr scintillation component, assumed to be unaﬀected
by xenon doping:

l(t) =

Using the parameters of the scintillation waveform for
electron recoils found in section III, and the reaction rate
kXe = 8,8×10−5 ppm−1nsec−1 (with ppm in mass) re-
ported in [9] it is possible to predict approximately the
shape of the scintillation signal for electron recoils and
the dependence of the LY on the xenon concentration,
[Xe].

Few waveforms for diﬀerent xenon concentrations are
shown in ﬁgure 3. The exact shape will depend on the

ments ([8], [3], [25], [26], [27]).
The variable which is typically used to discriminate elec-
tron from nuclear recoils in LAr is Fprompt, which informs
the abundance of the fast component in the scintillation
signal and is deﬁned as:

Fprompt =

(cid:82) t∗
0 l(t) dt
(cid:82) ∞
l(t) dt
0

where l(t) is the scintillation waveform and t∗ is the
integration time of the fast component which maximizes
the separation. Diﬀerent values of t∗ are used by diﬀer-
ent groups, but it is typically close to 100 nsec. Fprompt
depends on the recoil energy and the separation between
electron and nuclear recoils tends to get worse at lower
energies. The proposed model contains explicitly the
dependence of the scintillation signals of electron and
nuclear recoils from the density of deposited energy
and can be used to predict and explain the behavior of
Fprompt observed experimentally.

0 of Ar+

In order to evaluate Fprompt for electrons as a func-
tion of the kinetic energy, E, of the incoming electron,
prompt(E), it is necessary to evaluate the parameters k+
Fe
and q of equation 7. The prameter k+ is proportional to
the number density N+
2 , whose dependence on the
density of deposited energy is not known. It is reasonable
to assume, in ﬁrst approximation, that it stays constant
in the region of interest, below 1 MeV. The density of de-
posited energy varies very slowly down to 100 keV, where
it starts increasing more steeply. In this low energy re-
gion the eﬀect of the increased density is compensated
by the reduction of the escaping probability for the ion-
ization electrons due to the increased electric ﬁeld in the
core of the track.

In order to compare the model to data, the integral of
equation 28 is evaluated numerically using tabulated val-
ues for the electronic stopping power [29].

de(E) is well ﬁtted, for E<1 MeV, by the analytical

expression:

de(E) = 843(E−0.65 − 1.48E−0.43 + 0.66)

(30)

with E in MeV and de in MeV/µm3. The model predic-
tion is compared to experimental data from [8] and [27].
Fe

prompt is calculated as:

F e,n

prompt =

p1Ls + p2L3
Ls + L3

(31)

where L1 and L3 are the abundances of the fast and slow
components respectively (see equation 8), the parameters
p1 and p2 are related to the integration process for the
calculation of Fe,n
prompt (see equation 24) and in particular
to the fraction of fast and slow component which fall in-
side the integration window. Typically p1 is close to one
and p2 is close to zero. The fact of p1 not being exactly
equal to one is attributed to the delayed light emission of
the wavelength shifters used to detect LAr photons [17].
The parameters p1, p2 and ke
q are left free and adjusted
on data. The two data sets have been ﬁtted separately,
since they show some diﬀerences in their asymptotic be-
haviors at large energies, which is probably related to dif-
ferent integration intervals, and in their slopes at low en-
ergies. The result of the ﬁtting procedures is shown in ﬁg-
q = 0.73×10−7 nsec−1 MeV−1 µm3
ure 5. The values of ke
for [8] and ke
q = 1.9 × 10−7 nsec−1 MeV−1 µm3 for [27]
are obtained.

In the case of a low energy nuclear recoils of an argon
atom in LAr, below few hundreds of keV, a signiﬁcant
amount of the energy lost by the recoiling argon atom
is due to elastic collisions with other argon nuclei and
only a small fraction of it is transferred to the electrons.
The Lindhard theory [30] [11] gives the amount of energy
transferred to the electrons of the LAr in terms of the
dimensionless variable ε:

ε = CεE =

where E is the recoil energy, Z and A are the atomic and
mass number of the projectile (1) and of the medium (2)

diﬀusive processes. Using equations 25 and 34, the factor
q for low energy nuclear recoils is written as:

for very low energies, kV takes into account the increase
of the volume with the recoil energy and kn

Equations 36 and 8 (with τq = τ3) can be substituted in
equation 31 to evaluate Fn
prompt for nuclear recoils and
compare it to available data.
The model is ﬁtted to the data reported in [8] and re-
ferred to, as the high light yield sample, which span a
broad interval of energies, from 10 keV to above 1 MeV.
The conversion between the number of detected photo-
electrons (Nphel) and the nuclear recoil energy in [8] is
done assuming a constant relative scintillation yield be-
tween nuclear and electron recoils, Lef f , equal to 0,3. A
more appropriate conversion between Nphel and the recoil
energy, En, is given by:

(35)

Low energy nuclear recoils deposit their energy in a very
conﬁned portion of space. The projected range for ar-
gon ions of tens of keV kinetic energy in LAr is of the
order of few hundreds of ˚A [31] and the transversal di-
mensions of the core of the track is of the order of the
Bohr radius aB [11]. It is reasonable to assume that in
this range of energies, the spatial distribution of the Ar∗
2
is largely dominated by the fast diﬀusion of excitons and
holes before self-trapping and by the coulombian repul-
sion of the Ar ions in the core of the track. Under this
hypothesis, the recoil energy is deposited inside an ap-
proximately constant volume at very low energies. A lin-
ear growth of this volume with energy is expected, since
the total stopping power is constant for energies below
few hundreds ok keV [30] [11] and the range of the Ar
ions is proportional to its initial kinetic energy, while the

The quenching of the number of emitted photons in a
nuclear recoil event is described as the succession of three
distinct quenching processes: (i) the quenching of the
amount of energy transferred to the atomic electrons, due
to the elastic collisions of the argon ion with surround-
ing argon atoms [30]; (ii) the quenching of the excitons
formed after the nuclear recoil due to bi-excitonic quench-
ing [11]; (iii) the quenching of the triplet states formed
after the trapping of the excitons due to triplet-triplet in-
teractions (and triplet-ion in the presence of Ar+
2 ). The
overall quenching factor for nuclear recoils can be written
as:

QN = QL × QE × QT

(39)

QL is the quenching factor of process (i), which has been
calculated by Lindhard [30] and can be written as (refer
to equation 34):

left as free parameters. The exact value of En for the
Fn
prompt set of data is obtained by inverting numeri-
cally equation 38. The ﬁt procedure returns a value
of 0,11±0,01 MeV−1 nsec−1 for the product kqαn
3/V0,
9,1±0,1 Mev−1 for kV and 1,00±0,01 for the ratio
QE/Qel. Taking into account the value of ke
q found with
the ﬁt of Fe
3 =0.35
and that the recombination factor for nuclear recoils at
zero electric ﬁeld is zero (R(0)=0), the volume V0 ranges
between 200 and 500 nm3. This corresponds to a sphere
with a diameter between 7 and 10 nm, which is in a
reasonable agreement with the diﬀusion of free excitons
and holes before trapping,
for times of the order of
1 psec and assuming a diﬀusion constant D = 1 cm2/sec
[11].

A ﬁt procedure which uses only the Fn
prompt data set
is able to constrain pretty well the terms kqαn
3/V0 and kV ,
giving results compatible with the ones reported here,
while the range for the ratio QE/Qel turns out to be quite
broad (between 0,9 and 1,1). The same ratio QE/Qel
could be estimated following the α-core approximation
discussed in [11] giving a value close to unity, but with
a quite large uncertainty (at the level of 20-30%).

The result of the ﬁt for Fn

prompt is shown in ﬁgure 6
together with three more data sets. The data set referred
as low light yield is also taken from [8], but it is obtained
with a diﬀerent experimental set-up, with a lower light
yield with respect to the high light yield one. The two
other data sets are taken from [25] and [27]

The data sets have been aligned by applying overall
scaling factors to the Fn
prompt values (one per each
data set), which range between 1.01 and 1.05. The not
perfect overlap of the diﬀerent data sets before rescaling
is attributed to diﬀerent integration intervals to compute
Fn

prompt and to small systematic eﬀects.

The result of the ﬁt for Lef f is shown in ﬁgure 7. The
model prediction, together with the majority of available
data is shown in ﬁgure 8.

VIII. DISCUSSION

The triplet-triplet quenching reaction 1 has enough en-
ergy to ionize one of the two interacting triplet states,
since the band gap of LAr is about 14.2 eV [37]. The
model assumes that the ionized molecule and the elec-
tron recombine in a triplet state. This is a good as-
sumption if the spin relaxation time of the ion-electron
system is long compared to the recombination time. The
possibility that the ion-electron system recombine in a
singlet state has been tested by explicitly including it in
the model and a very small contribution, at the level of
percent, has been found and it has been neglected.
The triplet-ion quenching reaction 2 has enough energy
to dissociate the Ar2+ ion, whose binding energy is about

FIG. 6. Fprompt for nuclear recoils in LAr measured by dif-
ferent authors [8] [27] [25]. The high light yield sample (see
text) from [8] is used to ﬁt the data. Magenta line represents
the ﬁt result. The data sets have been aligned by applying
overall scale factors which vary between 1.01 and 1.05.

QE is the quenching factor of process (ii). It has been
pointed out in [10] that QE can be considered approxi-
mately constant for energies below few hundreds of keV.
This approximation has been proven to work well for liq-
uid xenon [32]. QT is the quenching factor for process
(iii), discussed in this work.
It can be written as (see
equation 8):

QT = αs + α3

ln(1 + qn(E) τ3)
qn(E) τ3

(41)

where αs = 0.65, α3 = 0.35, τ3 = 2100 nsec and qn(E)
is given by equation 36.

Experimentally, it is convenient to measure the rela-
tive scintillation yield of nuclear recoils with respect to
electron recoils, Lef f . Nuclear recoils are typically com-
pared to the recoils of electrons emitted after the photo-
absorption of the γ lines of 241Am (59.5 keV) and 57Co
(122 keV). Lef f can be estimated as:

Lef f =

QN
Qel = QL × QT ×

QE
Qel

(42)

where Qel
is the quenching factor of the reference
electron recoil. Since QE and Qel are both constant,
the ratio QE/Qel is an overall multiplicative constant in
equation 42.
In order to estimate the parameters of the model, an
overall ﬁt of the Fn
prompt data from [8] and of the Lef f
data reported by the ARIS Collaboration in [33]
is
performed, where the product kqαn
3/V0 and kV from
equation 36 and the ratio QE/Qel of equation 42 are

tation energy is found to be released is compatible with
the simple diﬀusion of free excitons and holes before self-
trapping (see Sec. VII) and the contribution of Ar∗
2 dif-
fusion should be negligible on the time scale of LAr scin-
tillation emission.
The model intorduces a possible additional quenching
mechanism of the scintillation light in LAr and poses a
serious question about its absolute photon yield. This
does not necessarily means that the photon yield (after
the quenching) is diﬀerent from what is widely assumed,
since it has never been directly measured. It is believed
that the ideal photon yield (51,000 photons/MeV [40]),
estimated on the basis of the value of Wel and Nex/Ni, is
reached by relativistic heavy ions and then scaled for the
other particles and energies according to the experimen-
tal results of relative measurements. This point should
be experimentally addressed since the technology of light
detection is mature enough to allow precision measure-
ments of the photon yield. This and other measurements
and characterizations of the LAr scintillation light prop-
erties would be extremely desirable in view of the design
of the next generation experiments for neutrino and Dark
Matter direct detection.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

This work describes a model for the production of LAr
scintillation light which takes into account the quench-
ing of Ar∗
2 through self interactions and interactions with
Ar+
2 ions. It allows to justify two processes which could
not be explained otherwise: the dependence of the slow
scintillation decay time from the intensity of an exter-
nal electric ﬁeld and the increase of the photon yield of
xenon doped liquid argon, both for low LET particle in-
teractions. It is possible to make an accurate prediction
of the time proﬁle of the scintillation pulse where the de-
pendence on the electric ﬁeld and on the density of the
deposited energy is explicit. A simultaneous ﬁt to exper-
imental average waveforms of electron and nuclear recoil
events allows to constrains some of the most relevant pa-
rameters of the model such as the unquenched decay time
of the slow scintillation component, τ3, which results to
be around 2100 nsec and the relative abundance of sin-
glet and triplet states for electron and nuclear recoils.
Knowing the shape of the scintillation pulse makes it
possible to analytically calculate the relative abundance
of slow component, Fprompt, which is often used as a
pulse shape discrimination parameter. The expressions
of Fprompt for electron and nuclear recoils need to be
ﬁtted to the available data to extract some of the pa-
rameters which are not precisely known, but the overall
behavior is well reproduced.
The model allows to predict the shape of the relative scin-
tillation eﬃciency for nuclear recoils in LAr, Lef f , and
it has been shown that it reproduces closely the experi-
mental data reported by the ARIS Collaboration [33].
LAr is a powerful medium for particle detection which

1.3 eV [38], and the model assumes that the Ar+ and Ar
recombine and the density of Ar+
2 states does not change.
An important hypothesis of the model is to neglect the
diﬀusion terms in equations 3 and 4. In the case of low
LET particles this is well justiﬁed by the transversal dis-
tribution (with respect to particle direction) of the den-
sity of deposited energy which is grater than hundreds
of nm, while the diﬀusion constant of Ar∗
2 should be of
the order of 10−6 cm2/s or less [39]. This assumption
is also consistent with the results obtained for nuclear
recoils, since the volume inside which the electronic exci-

ticle physics. Deepening the knowledge of its properties
can greatly beneﬁt the design of the next generation of
detectors.
