Abstract  

Background:  Previously (Kwon and Reis 2015), we proposed approximate Bayesian 
computation with single distribution selection (ABC-SD) for estimating mean and standard 
deviation from other reported summary statistics. We showed that ABC-SD outperforms other 
available methods when data are generated from skewed or heavy-tailed distributions and has 
comparable performance in symmetric distributions.  The ABC-SD generates pseudo data from a 
single parametric distribution thought to be the true distribution of underlying study data. This 
single distribution is either an educated guess, or it is selected via model selection using posterior 
probability criterion for testing two or more candidate distributions. Further analysis indicated 
that when model selection is used, posterior model probabilities are sensitive to the prior 
distribution(s) for parameter(s) and dependable on the type of reported summary statistics.  

Method: We propose ABC with Bayesian model averaging (ABC-BMA) methodology to 
estimate mean and standard deviation based on various sets of other summary statistics reported 
in published studies. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study to compare the new proposed 
ABC-BMA method with our previous ABC-SD method.   

Results: In the estimation of standard deviation, ABC-BMA has smaller average relative 
errors (AREs) than that of ABC-SD for normal, lognormal, beta, and exponential distributions. 
For Weibull distribution, ARE of ABC-BMA is larger than that of ABC-SD but <0.05 in small 
sample sizes and moves toward zero as sample size increases. When underlying distribution is 
highly skewed and available summary statistics are only quartiles and sample size, ABC-BMA is 
recommended but it should be used with caution. Comparison of mean estimation between ABC-
BMA and ABC-SD shows similar patterns of results as for standard deviation estimation. 

Conclusion: ABC-BMA is easy to implement and it performs even better than our previous 
ABC-SD method for estimation of mean and standard deviation.

Background 

Hozo et al. [1], Bland [2], and Wan et al. [3] proposed algebraic methods to estimate the sample 

mean and standard deviation. For instance, Hozo et al. [1] proposed a simple method for 

estimating the sample mean and standard deviation from the median, minimum, maximum, and 

the sample size.  Bland [2] proposed estimating these quantities based on the three quartiles, 

minimum, maximum, and the sample size. More recently, Wan et al. [3] proposed improved 

versions for Hozo et al. and Bland methods. They also provided a new method for estimation of 

the sample standard deviation based on the three quartiles, and the sample size.   

As an alternative to the above methods, we recently proposed a Monte Carlo procedure, the 

approximate Bayesian computation with single distribution selection (ABC-SD) method (Kwon 

and Reis [4]), for estimating mean and standard deviation.  In our previous simulations studies 

[4], we showed that ABC-SD outperforms other available methods when data are generated from 

skewed or heavy-tailed distributions and has comparable performance in symmetric 

distributions. We showed that the ABC-SD method produces more precise estimates of true 

study-specific mean and standard deviation as sample size increases and it also accommodates 

various distributions for underlying original data.  Furthermore, application of ABC-SD is not 

restricted to having available the mentioned descriptive statistics (minimum, maximum, and/or 

quartiles).  ABC-SD can be applied using other reported summary statistics such as mean and 

asymmetric 95% confidence interval, or Bayesian summaries (e.g.:  posterior mean, the 

maximum a posteriori probability (MAP), and 95% credible interval). 

The ABC-SD method generates pseudo data from a single distribution thought to be the 

distribution of unavailable study data. This single distribution is either an educated guess or it is 

selected via model selection using posterior probability criterion for testing two or more 

3 

 
candidate distributions. When model selection is used, we found out that posterior model 

probabilities are sensitive to the prior distribution(s) for parameter(s) and dependable on the type 

of reported summary statistics. In certain situations, model selection may cause misspecification 

of underlying distribution for ABC-based estimation method and lead to biased estimates of 

mean and standard deviation.  As a solution for these early observations, we now proposed ABC 

with Bayesian model averaging (ABC-BMA) to estimate sample mean and standard deviation.  

We found that our new proposed ABC-BMA method gives quite small relative errors compared 

to that of ABC-SD. An example of this is illustrated in section “Sensitivity analysis of prior 

distribution setting” where we generate data from beta, and examine model selection between 

beta and normal as the potential underlying distributions of sample data, using different prior 

distribution settings for parameters.   

In ‘Methods’ section we describe the proposed ABC-BMA method and its computational 

implementation. We begin with a brief summary of the ABC-SD method (Kwon and Reis [4]). 

In ’Results’, we describe and report the findings of the simulation studies comparing the 

performance of these methods and the impact of prior distributions.  We used the statistical 

software R in performing all statistical programming related to the implementation of the various 

methods, analysis, and simulations. 

Methods 

Meta-analysis is usually based on summary (aggregate) data from selected publications, in the 

form of a handful of descriptive or other summary statistics reported. Thus, in this context, 

formal Bayesian inference cannot be implemented due to unavailable of the subjects’ original 

4 

 
 
research data required for estimation of the data likelihood. However, using ABC methods, the 

calculation of the likelihood can be replaced by a comparison of summary statistics from the 

observed data and those from simulated pseudo data using a distance measure. Several review 

papers provide more detailed descriptions of ABC method as indicated in Beaumont [5] and 

Marin et al. [6]. 

ABC-SD: ABC with single distribution selection  

Here we give a brief summary of our ABC-SD method (Kwon and Reis [4]) for estimation of the 

mean and standard deviation using summary statistics. As shown in Table 1 (left column) ABC-

SD begins by choosing a single parametric distribution as the potential underlying distribution of 

original study data, f().We can choose an underlying distribution based on educated guess, 

given the set of reported summary statistics and the nature of outcome variable. For instance, 

when the outcome is related to distribution with positive support, there are several distributions 

to be considered, such as log-normal, Weibull, or exponential.  

After an underlying distribution selection, the second step of ABC-SD is to generate candidate 

value(s) for parameter(s), *, from uniform prior distribution(s), p(). For example, if we choose 

as the potential underlying distribution of original data the exponential distribution, then we only 

need to specify one uniform prior distribution for the scale parameter, .  If we choose a normal 

distribution, then two independent prior uniform distributions are need for the corresponding 

parameters mean () and standard deviation (). The third step is to generate pseudo-data, D*, 

from the chosen underlying distribution with likelihood function f(*), and to compute the same 

reported summary statistics of the observed data, S(D), from pseudo data, S(D*). The fourth and 

5 

 
 
 
last step is to decide whether * is accepted or not. This decision depends on the distance 

between summary statistics of the observed data, S(D), and those of pseudo data, S(D*) denoted 

by (S(D),S(D*)), where (,) is a distance measure. In our application of ABC, we used the 

Euclidean distance measure. If (S(D),S(D*)) is smaller than a fixed tolerance value  (i.e., 

(S(D),S(D*))<), then * is accepted, otherwise it is rejected. Steps 2-4 are repeated a large 

number of times (e.g., N=20,000) in order to obtain a big set of * values for the inference. 

Alternatively, instead of setting a small tolerance value, , we can select a fixed number of * 

values corresponding to an acceptance percentage. For example, with acceptance percentage of 

0.1% and N=50,000, we select 50 values of * corresponding to the top 0.1% with smallest 

Euclidean distance. The fundamental idea of ABC is that a good approximation of the posterior 

distribution can be obtained using summary statistics, S(D), and a fixed small tolerance value  

(or a pre-specified acceptance percentage). Mean and standard deviation are estimated using 

accepted values of parameter(s) in ABC-SD. In our previous publication (Kwon and Reis [4]) we 

proposed two ways to estimate mean and standard deviation: ‘plug-in method’ and ‘simulation’. 

The plug-in method consists of replacing means of accepted parameter values into the 

corresponding formulas for the mean and standard deviation.  The simulation approach consists 

of obtaining the mean values of calculated mean and standard deviation during steps 2-4 

implementation of ABC-SD. These two methods provide similar estimates of mean and standard 

deviation. In some applications/situations it may be difficult to choose a unique underlying 

distribution.  In this case, as described in our previous publication, we implement ABC-SD 

method for the several candidate distributions (K>2). Employing model selection (i.e. 

distribution selection in our context) while we apply the ABC-SD method, we calculate 

corresponding marginal posterior model probabilities (P(Mk|S), k=1,…,K) and then choose the 

6 

 
distribution with the highest marginal posterior model probability among K candidate 

distributions.   

ABC-BMA: ABC coupled with Bayesian model averaging method 

Although ABC-SD outperformed the previous proposed methods by Hozo et al. [1], Bland [2], 

and Wan et al. [3], we found that the selection of underlying distribution via posterior model 

probability was sensitive to the prior distribution(s) for parameter(s) and available descriptive 

summary statistics. To improve estimation, we now propose the use of ABC with Bayesian 

model averaging (ABC-BMA) methodology, using posterior model probability as weights, to 

estimate mean and standard deviation based on various sets of summary statistics reported in 

published studies.  Briefly, under ABC-BMA, estimates of mean and standard deviation are 

weighted average of those accepted values (estimated means and standard deviations of pseudo 

data). The weights are the proportions of accepted values from each candidate distribution, 

which are the estimated posterior model probabilities for the distributions.  

Table 1 (right column) summarizes the steps for implementation of the ABC-BMA method. The 

first step is to produce a list of K potential candidate distributions (K>1).  The second step of 

ABC-BMA is to choose a distribution among the K distributions (M1, …, MK) using multinomial 

distribution with probability  = (1, …, K), where k=1/K, k=1,…,K. In the third step, given 

chosen distribution Mk, we generate a set of candidate value(s) for parameter(s), *, from 

specific uniform prior distribution(s), 𝑝𝑀𝑘(𝜃). The fourth step is to generate pseudo data, D*, 

from the likelihood function, 𝑓𝑀𝑘(𝜃∗), where 𝑓𝑀𝑘(∙) is a chosen underlying distribution and 

compute summary statistics of simulated data, S(D*). The fifth step is to decide whether * is 

7 

 
 
 
accepted or not. This decision is similar to that of ABC-SD, which depends on the distance 

between summary statistics of the observed data, S(D), and those of simulated data, S(D*) 

denoted by (S(D),S(D*)). Steps 2-5 are repeated a large number of times (e.g., N=20,000) in 

order to obtain estimates of mean and standard deviation and Mk for the inference. In order to 

obtain better convergence we consider adaptive step during the iterations. The k values in  will 

be adjusted at every 1,000 iterations according to accepted frequency of each distribution, Mk. 

As the iteration increases, a more promising distribution is likely to be selected more often. In 

the sixth and last step, we calculate mean and standard deviation estimates as the weighted 

average of those accepted values (estimated means and standard deviations of pseudo-data).  As 

mentioned earlier, the weights are the proportions of accepted values from each candidate 

distribution. 

Results 

Designs of simulation studies  

Previously in [4], we showed that ABC-SD method outperformed the other available methods 

(Hozo et al., Bland, and Wan et al.).The main focus in this simulation study is then to compare 

ABC-BMA with ABC-SD only.  In this paper, we use the same simulation design settings used 

in [4], including the same five underlying data distributions (normal, log-normal, beta, 

exponential and Weibull) and the same three scenarios (S1, S2, and S3) of available summary 

statistics.  That is, we assume available in S1, the minimum (xmin), median (xQ2), maximum (xmax) 

and the sample size (n); in S2, the first and third quartiles (xQ1 and xQ3) in addition to summary 

statistics in S1; and in S3, the three quartiles and the sample size.  

8 

 
 
In S1, we use five distributions: normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 17, 

N(50,17); log-normal distribution with location parameter=4 and scale parameter=0.3, 

LN(4,0.3); Weibull distribution with shape parameter=2 and scale parameter=35, Weibull(2,35),  

beta distribution with shape parameters 9 and 4, Beta(9,4); and exponential distribution with 

mean=10, Exponential(10). In S2, we compare two ABC-based methods in lognormal and beta 

distributions. We use three log-normal distributions with same location parameter value of 5 but 

having three different scale parameter values (0.25, 0.5, and 1) in order to evaluate effect of 

skewness.  In addition, we use three beta distributions, Beta(5,2), Beta(1,3), and Beta(0.5,0.5), to 

examine effect of skewness and bimodality in estimation for bounded data distribution.  In S3, 

we use the same five distributions in S1 (normal, lognormal, beta, exponential and Weibull) to 

investigate further the effect of chosen descriptive statistics for the standard deviation estimation. 

In each scenario we consider 10 sample sizes (n= 10, 40, 80, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600).  

We obtain a sample of n observations from a particular distribution, and compute the sample 

mean (true 𝑥̅) and sample standard deviation (true S), as well as sample descriptive statistics 

under each scenario. We obtain the estimates of the sample mean and standard deviation from 

the given sample descriptive statistics under each scenario, using the two ABC methods.  The 

relative errors (REs) are calculated as follows: 

𝑅𝐸 𝑜𝑓 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 =

(𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑥̅− 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒  𝑥̅)
𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑥̅

,                                                                          (1) 

and 

𝑅𝐸 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =

(𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑆− 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑆)

𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒  𝑆

.                                                  (2) 

For each sample size n, we repeat this procedure 200 times to obtain average relative errors 

(AREs).  

9 

 
In the simulations, we set acceptance percentage 0.1% and 20,000 total number of iterations for 

ABC-SD method and same acceptance percentage of 0.1% and 50,000 total number of iterations 

for ABC-BMA. For fair comparison, we use the same uniform prior distributions for each 

distribution as described in Table 2 of Kwon and Reis [4].  For ABC-BMA, we set as our list of 

potential candidate underlying distributions the following: normal, lognormal, exponential, 

Weibull, and beta distributions.   

Results of simulation studies 

In the simulation studies we compare estimation performance of the two ABC-based methods in 

terms of average relative error (ARE) for estimating mean and standard deviation.  In the next 

three subsections we present comparison of methods for standard deviation estimation.  In the 

last subsection, we present comparison of the two ABC-based methods for mean estimation.  

Comparison of ABC-SD and ABC-BMA for standard deviation estimation in scenario S1 

Figure 1 shows that AREs in estimating standard deviation for ABC-SD and ABC-BMA 

methods for five different distributions.  When the underlying distribution is normal, lognormal, 

beta, or exponential, ABC-BMA has much smaller AREs in small sample size (<100) and 

comparable AREs in all other sample sizes.  For lognormal and beta distributions, it seems to be 

huge improvement in reducing AREs in small and moderate sample sizes when we use the ABC-

BMA method.  For Weibull distribution, ARE of ABC-BMA is larger than that of ABC-SD but 

<0.05 in small sample sizes and moves toward zero as sample size increases.  Overall, for non-

symmetrical distributions, ABC-BMA method shows improvement in reducing AREs in small 

and moderate sample sizes and maintain small AREs in large sample sizes.   

10 

 
 
 
Comparison of ABC-SD and ABC-BMA for standard deviation estimation in scenario S2 

In this scenario, S2, more information is available compared to other two scenarios; that is, we 

assume available the minimum (xmin), maximum (xmax), the three quartiles (xQ1, xQ2 and xQ3) and 

sample size (n). We examine performance of two ABC-based methods for asymmetric 

distributions, either highly skewed or bimodal distribution.  Using lognormal distribution, we 

investigate change of AREs as degree of skewness increases from mild to severe. The ABC-SD 

method showed decreasing ARE pattern, although relatively large AREs were shown in small 

and moderate sample sizes.  The ABC-BMA method performs better than ABC-SD in small or 

moderate sample sizes. The two methods are similar in large sample size, but ARE of ABC-

BMA is more close to 0. (Figure 2).   

Using beta distribution, we investigate the effect of bimodality as well as skewness for bounded 

data. (Figure 2)  The two methods show negative AREs, that is, underestimation of study-

specific true sample standard deviation. For all three beta distributions, the two methods have 

quite similar AREs when sample size is greater than 40. The ABC-BMA performs better and 

shows gain in terms of ARE towards zero for n≤40.  

These results indicate that the ABC-BMA method performs better than ABC-SD in asymmetric 

distributions, and also better than the method by Wan et al. [3], shown in our previous 

publication [4], in asymmetric distributions when sample size is small and methods are similar in 

large sample sizes.

Comparison of ABC-SD and ABC-BMA for standard deviation estimation in scenarios S1, S2, 

and S3 

We investigate the effect of having available various sets of summary statistics on the 

performance of the ABC-BMA method (Figure 3). For normal and beta distribution in S3, ABC-

BMA shows very similar ARE pattern compared to that of ABC-SD. However, compared with 

other two scenarios (S1 and S2), ABC-BMA method in S3 has worse performance for small n, 

and similar performance for moderate to large n. For underlying lognormal distribution, when 

n>40 ARE is negative (that is, underestimation) for ABC-BMA in S3, in contrast to ABC-SD in 

S3 and the other ABC-BMA in S1 and S2 showing slight overestimation.  Moreover, the ABC-

BMA in S3 shows overall larger AREs as compared to ABC-SD under Weibull, and in small 

sample sizes under exponential. It seems that the Q1, and Q3 summary statistics in S3 are not 

sufficient to distinguish potential distributions with small to moderate skewness. For skewed 

distributions, having xmin and xmax improve estimation as shown by ARE close to zero in S1 and 

S2.  

Comparison of ABC-SD and ABC-BMA for mean estimation in scenarios S1, S2, and S3 

We compare AREs for mean estimation between the two ABC-based methods. In Figure 4, solid 

line denotes ABC-SD and dashed line denotes ABC-BMA. Circle symbols are for S1 (solid 

circle for ABC-SD and open circle for ABC-BMA), triangle symbols for S2 (solid triangle for 

ABC-SD and open triangle for ABC-BMA), and cross symbol is for S3. The two ABC-based 

methods have comparable performance in estimating mean for normal and beta distributions in 

all three scenarios. For exponential and Weibull distribution, ABC-BMA performs better than 

ABC-SD in small sample sizes under S1 and S2.  While AREs of ABC-SD for lognormal 

12 

 
 
distribution under S1 show large deviation from zero in moderate sample sizes, those of ABC-

BMA are close to zero and show huge improvement. Like in standard deviation estimation, for 

moderately skewed distributions under S3 (log-normal, and Weibull for example), ABC-BMA 

shows slightly worse performance than ABC-SD in estimating mean.  

Model probabilities of distributions in ABC-BMA method by available summary statistics 

We examine model probabilities of distribution selection across different sample sizes to 

elucidate effect of available summary statistics. Normal, beta, and exponential distributions have 

large average model probabilities (>0.8) in all scenarios.  (See Figures 5A, 5B, and 5C). 

However, lognormal and Weibull distributions show different pattern of average model 

probability. For lognormal distribution, when sample size are less than 200, average model 

probability of lognormal distribution is less than 0.5 and that of normal distribution is larger than 

0.5 in both S1 and S2. For Weibull distribution, normal and exponential distributions are main 

contender when sample size is small and average model probability of Weibull becomes larger 

than 0.5 when sample size is more than 40 under S1 and S2. These two distributions do not have 

meaningful average model probability for all sample sizes under S3. Instead, normal distribution 

has high average model probability (see Figure 5C).  

When underlying true distribution is symmetric, highly skewed, or bounded support (e.g., 

normal, exponential, and beta distribution in our simulation study), true underlying distribution 

has very high model probability in all sample sizes. These shapes of underlying distributions can 

be easily identified by available summary statistics in all three scenarios. However, if a 

distribution is moderately skewed, like lognormal and Weibull distributions in our simulation 

setting, having only the 3 quartiles and sample size is not sufficient to distinguish from normal 

13 

 
 
distribution. When xmin and xmax are available in addition to Q2 or all 3 quartiles, moderately 

skewed underlying true distribution has high average model probability as sample size increases. 

Sensitivity analysis of prior distribution setting 

We conduct a small simulation study for the sensitivity analysis of prior distribution setting. We 

consider underlying distribution is a beta distribution with shape parameters 9 and 4 and generate 

data for a sample size of 400 and calculate the following set of summary statistics: xQ1=0.5993, 

xQ2=0.6853, xQ3=0.7735 sample mean=0.6814, and sample SD=0.1247. We examine model 

selection between beta and normal distributions with different prior settings and assuming 

available only the 3 quartiles and sample size (S3). For prior distributions of the shape parameters 

in beta distribution we use same uniform distributions as follows: either U(0,40), used in the 

previous publication and current simulations, or U(0,20), which characterizes a less vague prior 

distribution. For normal distribution, we use for location parameter, , a fixed prior U(xQ1, xQ3) 

and for scale parameter, , either U(0,1)  or U(0,0.5).  Note that the latter one represents less 

vague prior distribution. Based on these prior distributions for beta shape parameters and normal 

scale parameter, we have the following four combinations of priors for this simulation study: (1) 

U(0,40) for beta distribution and U(0,1) for normal distribution, (2) U(0,40) for beta distribution 

and U(0,0.5) for normal distribution, (3) U(0,20) for beta distribution and U(0,1) for normal 

distribution, and (4) U(0,20) for beta distribution and U(0,0.5) for normal distribution. In Table 2 

we report posterior model probability for each distribution, along with relative errors (REs) for 

mean and SD from ABC-SD and ABC-BMA. In three out of four cases, beta distribution has 

model probability greater than 0.5. However, if normal distribution has less vague prior 

distribution for  then model probability of normal is larger than 0.5, and it would be chosen as 

14 

 
 
the underlying distribution of original sample data under ABC-SD.  This would give more biased 

estimate of SD but not of mean. Moreover, it is not easy to assign similar vagueness for 

parameters of each distribution since some parameters are scale parameter and others are shape 

parameters. If we unintentionally assign less vague prior distribution of one of parameters, model 

probability might lead to incorrect choice of underlying distribution. 

Real Data Examples 

We illustrate estimation of sample means and standard deviation, via our two ABC methods and 

also by the method of Wan et al. [3], using real data from two publications. For the ABC 

methods we use 0.1% acceptance percentage and total number of iterations is 100,000. In 

addition, for ABC-BMA we set five underlying distributions: normal, log-normal, beta, 

exponential and Weibull.  

As our first illustration, we use data from a randomized controlled trial by Silver et al. [7], to 

estimate mean and standard deviation of the length of stay (LOS) in hospital. The available 

summary statistics for LOS in the 3% hypertonic saline arm, shown in Table 3 of [7], were 

sample size (n=111), median, Q2 (2.1), the first quartile, Q1 (1.2), and the third quartile, Q3 (4.6) 

(S3 scenario). Wan et al. method, which assumes normal distribution, gives 2.633 for mean 

estimate and 2.554 for SD estimate. ABC-SD based on normal distribution gives 2.680 for mean 

estimate and 2.612 for SD estimate. These two methods give quite comparable estimates for both 

mean and SD, since both assume underlying data is normally distributed. ABC-SD based on log-

normal gives 3.918 for mean estimate and 5.384 for SD estimate. Based on summary statistics, 

we can conjecture that underlying distribution is positively skewed (long right tailed), therefore 

estimates from ABC-SD based on log-normal are better than those from ABC-SD based on 

15 

 
 
 
normal or Wan et al. method. ABC-BMA gives 3.802 for mean estimate and 5.205 for SD 

estimate with slightly higher model probability for lognormal distribution (52%). Estimates from 

ABC-SD based on log-normal and from ABC-BMA are similar, and both are more appropriated. 

However, as shown in the simulation ABC-BMA provides relative small bias in small sample 

sizes even if true underlying distribution is log normal.  

In our second illustration, we use data by Hamstra et al. [8] on the Expanded Prostate Cancer 

Index Composite (EPIC), which is one of widely used patient-reported outcomes in prostate 

cancer population. EPIC consists of four domains: Urinary, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal 

domains.  In Hamstra et al. [8], EPIC bowel summary scores at baseline, 2 months, 6 months, 12 

months, and 24 months were reported with sample size, median, mean, minimum, and maximum 

values (S1 scenario). In this illustration, we estimate standard deviation for EPIC bowel 

summary score at the baseline.  Reported summary statistics, in Table 2 of [8], for the baseline 

are 100 (median), 95 (mean), 91.7 (minimum), and 100 (maximum). Since EPIC score is 

bounded between zero and one hundred, we perform ABC-SD based on beta distribution with 

transformed scale falling into between zero and one.  In addition, we perform ABC-SD based on 

normal distribution to be able to compare with Wan et al. method. The estimate of SD from 

ABC-SD based on beta distribution is 1.168, based on normal distribution is 1.528 and by Wan 

et al. method is 1.453. From ABC-BMA, estimate of SD is 1.233 and it is preferable based on 

results of our simulation studies on underlying beta distribution.

Discussion 

In general, ABC-based method to estimate mean and standard deviation is very flexible to the 

available summary statistics and performs well in various distributions. We rely on model 

probability of distribution selection to choose underlying distribution in ABC-SD. The model 

probability is sensitive to prior distribution setting and available summary statistics. The 

misspecification of underlying distribution for ABC-SD can lead to more biased (under or 

over)estimation of mean and standard deviation estimate.  We show this in the particular 

simulation study comparing beta and normal distribution. As solution to this, we investigated and 

now proposed ABC-BMA which implements estimation as a weighted average of estimates from 

K>2 potential distributions for underlying data, using the corresponding posterior model 

probabilities as weights.  We found that ABC-BMA gives quite small RE compared to that of 

single distribution, that is, our ABC-SD method 

In order to understand why estimate from model averaging approach has smaller error than 

estimate from single distribution, we run a particular simulation study, setting n=100 and 

lognormal distribution with =4 and =0.3 in S1.  Figure 6 shows individual relative errors 

(REs) for 200 repetitions of simulated data. ARE of ABC-SD is -0.186 and of ABC-BMA is 

0.031, corresponding to 83.3% reduction in absolute bias. When data has an underlying 

lognormal distribution, normal distribution is a main contender for selection based on model 

probability in ABC-BMA (see Figure 5A, log-normal plot). In small sample sizes, we observe 

that model probability of normal distribution can be higher than that of lognormal distribution 

even though underlying true distribution is lognormal. In Figure 6 note that 90% of estimates of 

standard deviation from ABC-SD with lognormal distribution are under estimated. In ABC-

BMA estimation, significant portion of estimates comes from normal distribution and those tend 

to be over-estimated and compensate under-estimated estimates from lognormal distribution.  

Conclusion 

We propose an enhanced ABC-based approach utilizing BMA to estimate the mean and standard 

deviation when only descriptive statistics are available. Our ABC-BMA method shows reduction 

of AREs in small and moderate sample sizes and comparable performance to ABC-SD approach 

in large sample size. AREs of ABC-BMA method were smaller and very stable across different 

sample sizes when underlying distribution is less skewed. When underlying distribution is highly 

skewed and available summary statistics are Q1, Q2, and Q3, ABC-BMA is recommended but it 

should be used with cautious. Comparison of mean estimation between ABC-BMA and ABC-SD 

showed similar patterns of results as for standard deviation estimation.

Step 1: Select a single distribution for 
underlying original data, f(). (See note 
below.) . 
Step 2: * ~ p(); generate * from  uniform 
prior distribution(s). For example, if f is 
normal, uniform prior distributions for  and 
 need to be specified. 

Step 1: Prepare a list of candidate distributions 
for underlying original data. 

Step 2: Select one distribution Mk from a set of K 
potential underlying distributions using 
multinomial (), where ={1,…, K}# such as 
k>0 k=1,…,K and kk=1. Note: initial value of 
={1/K,…,1/K}.  

Step 3: D* ~ f(*); generate pseudo data. 
Compute summary statistics from pseudo 
data, S(D*)and compare with reported 
summary  statistics, S(D). 

Step 4: If d(S(D*),S(D))<  then * is 
accepted. 

Repeat steps 2-4 many times to get 
enough number of accepted * values 
(e.g., 20,000). 

Step 5: Mean and standard deviation 
estimates are obtained using either ‘plug-in 
method’ or ‘simulation’.  

------------------------- 
Note: The single distribution for underlying 
distribution of original data is either an 
educated guess or it is determined via model 
selection using posterior probability 
criterion.  

Step 3: * ~ 𝑝𝑀𝑘(𝜃); generate * from 
corresponding prior  distribution of Mk. 

Step 4: D* ~ 𝑓𝑀𝑘(𝜃∗); generate pseudo data. 
Compute summary statistics, S(D*) and compare 
with reported summary statistics, S (D).       

Step 5: If d(S*, S)<  then Mk and estimates of 
mean and standard deviation are accepted. 

#Adjust  at every 1,000 iterations based on 
accepted frequency of each distribution.  

Repeat steps 2-5 many times to get enough 
number of accepted Mk and estimates of 
mean and standard deviation (e.g., 50,000). 

Step 6: Mean and standard deviation estimates 
are calculated as the weighted average of those 
accepted values (estimated means and standard 
deviations of pseudo-data). The weights are the 
proportions of accepted values of each candidate 
distribution, which are posterior model 
probabilities for each candidate distribution.
