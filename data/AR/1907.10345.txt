ABSTRACT

The emergence of active regions (ARs) closely relates to the solar dynamo and
the dynamical atmospheric phenomena. With high-resolution and long-lasting
observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, we report a new dynamic
activity phenomenon named “fan-shaped activity (FSA)” in the emerging phase
of NOAA AR 12700. The FSAs are clearly observed at Hα wavelength and are
closely related to the dynamics of the adjacent arch ﬁlament system (AFS), in-
cluding threads deformation and materials downward motions. On 2018 February
26, the two most representative FSAs appeared around 05:21 UT and 06:03 UT,
respectively, and they ﬁrstly ascended and then decayed in around 10 minutes.
At the ascending phase, accompanied by the uplifting of an adjacent AFS, each
FSA launches up at one end of the AFS and extends for up to ∼11 Mm. At the
decaying phase, the FSA gradually vanishes, and materials downﬂows towards
the other end of the AFS are detected. After checking the evolution of the mag-
netic ﬁelds of AR 12700, we ﬁnd that each FSA is located between the end of
an AFS and an adjacent magnetic patch with the same polarity and launches at
the onset of the collision and compression between these two magnetic patches.
We propose that the collision lifts up the AFS, and then the initially compact
AFS laterally expands, resulting in the formation of FSA. A cartoon model is
proposed to depict the activities.

Introduction

The emergence of active regions (ARs) is a multi-stage process along with various com-
plex phenomena (van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015). Magnetic ﬂux tubes emerging through
the photosphere will form a series of bipoles, and then the conjugated polarities of each bipole
move apart. Eventually patches with the same polarity may merge to form pore-like fea-
tures. When rising to the chromosphere, the emerging ﬂux tubes are traced out by arch
ﬁlament system (AFS; Bruzek 1967). AFS is dark arch-shaped feature connecting two oppo-
site magnetic polarities of newly emerging bipoles, with an upward motion at their tops and
plasma downward motion along their legs. Spadaro et al. (2004) observed the AFS dynamic
evolution during the emergence of AR 10050, which showed that the values of both upﬂow
and downﬂow velocities of the AFS decreased during the evolution of the AR.

Recently, the high temporal and spatial resolution observations have lead to signiﬁ-
cant progress on the research about AR emergence. Data from Hinode/Solar Optical Tele-
scope (SOT; Tsuneta et al. 2008) have revealed the nature of ﬂux emergence (Otsuji et al.
2011) and evidenced granular-scale elementary ﬂux emergence episodes during the emer-
gence of AR 11024 (Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. 2012). Observations from Hinode, Interface
Region Imaging Spectrometer (De Pontieu et al. 2014), and Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO; Pesnell et al. 2012) detected various local heating events in a new emerging-ﬂux re-
gion of AR 12401 (Toriumi et al. 2017). Several ground-based solar telescopes have also
made great contributions. Employing observations of the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT;
von der L¨uhe 1998), Xu et al. (2010) performed the ﬁrst investigation on the vector magnetic
ﬁeld and Doppler velocity in the lower solar atmospheric layers of a young emerging-ﬂux re-
gion. Gonz´alez Manrique et al. (2017) analyzed VTT observations of an AFS and presented
the decay and convergence of two micro-pores with diameters of less than one arc-second
in a small emerging-ﬂux region. Goode Solar Telescope (Goode & Cao 2012) observed the
emergence of small-scale ﬂux ropes in the photosphere (Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. 2014) and
the chromosphere (Yan et al. 2017). Moreover, several studies of AFS based on spectropo-
larimetric observations by GREGOR (Schmidt et al. 2012) reported supersonic downﬂows
along the legs of the arch ﬁlaments (Balthasar et al. 2016; Gonz´alez Manrique et al. 2018).
In our previous work (Zhong et al. 2019), combining observations from the New Vacuum
Solar Telescope (NVST; Liu et al. 2014) and the nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrap-
olation results, the detailed process of interchange reconnections in the center of AR 12700
during its emerging phase were presented.

Great eﬀorts at numerical simulations have also been made to model the ﬂux emergence
(see review of Cheung & Isobe 2014 and the references therein), and recent three-dimensional
(3D) magnetohydrodynamics simulations have successfully produced an AR based on diﬀer-

– 3 –

ent emergence conditions (Cheung et al. 2010; Archontis & Hood 2012; Rempel & Cheung
2014; Chen et al. 2017; and reference therein). Additionally, combining direct analysis of the
numerical data, 3D visualization, and spectropolarimetric synthesis, Moreno-Insertis et al.
(2018) identiﬁed two types of small-scale emerging magnetic structures in the quiet Sun. The
emerging granule-covering ﬂux sheets in their models may match the subarcsecond resolution
observations of Centeno et al. (2017).

When magnetic ﬂux emerges from beneath the photosphere, it may reconnect with
the preexisting ﬁelds, which would heat the local plasma, give rise to jets and emit waves
that propagate into the corona (Isobe et al. 2008). Surges, the most common dynamic ac-
tivities in solar atmosphere, are ejections of cool and dense plasma in the chromosphere.
Generally, they eject upwards along straight or curved paths at velocities of 10 to 200 km
s−1, reaching heights of 5 to 100 Mm, and lasting for 10 to 30 minutes (Shibata 1982;
Schmieder et al. 1995; Canﬁeld et al. 1996). Observationally, surges are often found at
emerging ﬂux region in its earliest stage (Kurokawa & Kawai 1993), or on light bridge in
the well-developed or decaying sunspots (Louis et al. 2014; Robustini et al. 2016; Hou et al.
2017; Tian et al. 2018). It is widely believed that the surge is caused by magnetic reconnec-
tion related to ﬂux emergence or ﬂux cancellation, which is supported by observational ev-
idences (Chae et al. 1999; Yoshimura et al. 2003; Liu & Kurokawa 2004; Bharti et al. 2007;
Li et al. 2016) and numerical simulations (Yokoyama & Shibata 1995, 1996; Jiang et al.
2011, 2012; N´obrega-Siverio et al. 2017).

In this paper, we report a new dynamic activity phenomenon, fan-shaped activity (FSA),
in the emerging phase of AR 12700 on 2018 February 26. This kind of activities is related to
AFS and owns a similar appearance to surge but without brighteness in extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) channel. We analyse the characteristics and driver mechanism of FSA based on the
Hα observations acquired at the NVST and the simultaneous observations from Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) as well as Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the SDO. At Hα wavelength, several FSAs are detected,
which are closely associated with the dynamics of the adjacent AFS, including threads defor-
mation and materials downﬂows. The two most representative FSAs appeared around 05:21
UT and 06:03 UT, respectively. They exhibits a rapid evolution, ascending and decaying
within a period of about 10 minutes. At the ascending phase, accompanied by the uplifting
of the adjacent AFS, each FSA rises at one end of the AFS and extends for up to ∼11 Mm.
After that,the FSA fades away, with materials falling down towards the other end of the
AFS.

Our paper is organized as follow. In Section 2, we describe the observations and data
analysis taken in this study. Section 3 investigates the FSA in detail. Finally, we summarize

– 4 –

the major ﬁndings, discuss the results, and suggest a possible mechanism for the formation
of the FSA in Section 4.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

The emerging AR 12700 with β−conﬁguration at solar disk location N04W01 was ob-
served by the NVST on 2018 February 26. The instruments currently installed on NVST
include the adaptive optics (AO) system, multi-channel imaging system, and two vertical
grating spectrometers (Liu et al. 2014). The imaging system of NVST consists of one chan-
nel for the chromosphere (Hα) and two channels for the photosphere (TiO and G-band).
The NVST Hα 6563 ˚A observations adapted in this work were taken from 02:01:00 UT to
06:56:00 UT and covered a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 152′′ × 151′′ with a pixel size of 0.′′136
and a cadence of 8 s. The NVST Hα images can clearly display the detailed AR emergence
process in the chromosphere, including ﬁbrils emergence, reconnections between diﬀerent
groups of ﬁbrils, and FSAs. In this work, the two representative FSAs appearing at 05:21
UT and 06:03 UT are studied in detail. In order to ﬁgure out the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld evolution and coronal response during the activities, we have also analyzed the data
taken by the HMI and AIA on board SDO. The HMI data adopted here were obtained
from 2018 February 25 to 26. The time resolution of the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms
taken by HMI is 45 s and the spatial resolution is 1.′′0. The AIA provides simultaneous
full-disk images of the multi-layered solar atmosphere with 10 passbands, 7 of which are
in EUV channel and observed with a cadence of 12 s and a pixel size of 0.′′6. All images
observed by the SDO are diﬀerentially rotated to a reference time (04:00:00 UT on February
26). Moreover, data from all telescopes and instruments are carefully co-aligned by using
the AIA images as a reference. According to some features which can be simultaneously
detected in SDO/AIA 171 ˚A, and NVST Ha channels, such as dark ﬁbrils and bright points,
the original Hα images are rotated and shifted to be co-aligned with the AIA images. Since
AIA images and HMI magnetograms have already been co-aligned, HMI magnetograms and
the processed Hα images are then co-aligned as well.

To derive the horizontal photospheric velocities during the two FSAs, we apply the
diﬀerential aﬃne velocity estimator (DAVE; Schuck 2006). The DAVE method combines
the magnetic induction equation and an aﬃne velocity proﬁle to a windowed aperture of
the magnetogram sequence to determine the optical ﬂow of magnetic footpoints. We set the
window size as 12 pixels in DAVE, and obtain the velocity ﬁeld from the diﬀerence between
two sets of HMI LOS magnetograms with ﬁve-minute interval.

In addition, we make time-slice plot to obtain the velocity of the downﬂow. Firstly, we

– 5 –

approximate the trajectory of downward material ﬂow by an arc-sector domain. During the
period of the downward motion, we collect the imaging data within the arc-sector domain
and store them as a two-dimensional array every 8 seconds. Then we merge these arrays
into one larger two-dimensional array in chronological order. Finally, we display the ﬁnal
array in a ﬁgure (time-slice plot) with its X-axis referring to time and Y-axis to distance. In
this manner, the slope of the dashed line connecting each endpoint of the downﬂow in the
time-slice plot indicates the projective downward velocity.

In order to investigate the magnetic conﬁguration of the two FSAs, we use the “weighted
optimization” method (Wiegelmann 2004; Wiegelmann et al. 2012) to perform NLFFF ex-
trapolations at 05:24 UT and 06:12 UT on February 26, respectively. We utilize the HMI
photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds as the boundary condition. Here, the vector magne-
tograms are preprocessed by a procedure developed by Wiegelmann et al. (2006) to satisfy
the force-free condition. Both NLFFF extrapolations are performed in a box of 288 × 168
× 256 uniformly spaced grid points (104 × 61 × 93 Mm3).

3. Results

With the high-resolution and long-lasting Hα observation of NVST from 02:01 UT to
06:56 UT on February 26, we detect a new interesting phenomenon within the emerging
AR 12700, namely FSA. Several FSAs are observed, which have the similar appearance to
the Hα surges reported in Shimizu et al. (2009) and Robustini et al. (2016). And two FSAs
are investigated in detail in the present work (see Figure 1). Each FSA is located at the
footpoint of an AFS, which is detected clearly at EUV and Hα wavelengths.

The ﬁrst fan-shaped activity (FSA1) was well observed from 05:21 UT to 05:35 UT
on February 26 (see Figure 2 and animation 1), which was located at the north end of an
AFS (AFS1). The northern footpoint of AFS1 was anchored in a positive magnetic patch
as shown in panel (a). FSA1 ascended from 05:21 UT to 05:28 UT, peaked at 05:29 UT,
and descended from 05:30 UT to 05:35 UT. At the ascending stage of FSA1, small-scale
threads spouted out at the north end of AFS1 and swept from west to east, which were
projected onto a surface to exhibit a fan-shaped feature. At the peak of the activity (Figure
2(d)), the fan-shaped feature consisted of three threads (which are outlined by white dotted
curves) with a maximum projected length of about 5 Mm. At the descending stage of FSA1,
shown as panel (e), distinct downﬂow was detected from 05:31 UT to 05:34 UT at the other
footpoint of AFS1. The averaged velocity of the ﬂow towards the south end was ∼33 km
s−1.

– 6 –

To investigate the origin of this FSA, we check the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld evolution
of AFS1 (see ﬁgure 3 and animation 2). The bipole connected by the AFS1 initially emerged
at about 02:00 UT. Then the positive and negative patches of this bipole drifted northeast-
ward and southwestward, respectively. In the following three hours, these two target patches
constantly merged with the surrounding magnetic elements with the same polarities, ﬁnally
forming the two polarities (P1/N1) connected by AFS1. From 05:00 UT, P1 drifted towards
the north patch (P2) and then the collision between P1 and P2 occurred at where the FSA
subsequently launched. In addition, we calculated the photospheric velocity ﬁelds by ana-
lyzing the HMI LOS magnetograms with DAVE method. As shown in panels (b1)-(b2), at
04:12 UT, P1 was approaching P2 with the velocity of ∼0.45 km s −1. And at 05:13 UT,
the approaching velocity rose to ∼0.5 km s−1, after which compression and collision between
P1 and P2 occurred. Combining the HMI magnetograms and Hα observations, it is clearly
shown that FSA1 launched soon after the collision started.

The second fan-shaped activity (FSA2) was well observed from 06:03 UT to 06:28 UT
(see Figure 4 and animation 3), which launched near the southwestern footpoint of another
AFS (AFS2). FSA2 ascended from 06:03 UT to 06:13 UT, peaked at about 06:14 UT,
and descended from 06:15 UT to 06:20 UT. At 06:03 UT, accompanied by the uplifting
of the AFS2, thread-like features began to fan out, forming a fan-shaped feature. At the
ascending stage, the number of the threads that make up the fan-shaped feature grew and
their length extended, with the maximum projected length up to ∼11 Mm. After that, at
the northeastern end of AFS2, materials falling at a velocity of ∼32 km s−1 were clearly
detected from 06:15 UT to 06:16 UT (see panel (d)).

Figure 5 displays the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld evolutions of AFS2 (also see animation
4). The bipole connected by the AFS2 emerged around 18:00 UT on February 25 and
the emergence region is outlined by the blue parentheses in Figure 4(a1). Then the bipole
connected by the third AFS (AFS3) emerged at 00:07 UT on February 26. They all separated
from each other along northeast-southwest direction.
In the following couples of hours,
these bipoles constantly merged with the surrounding magnetic elements, ﬁnally forming the
polarities (P3/N3 and P4/N4 in panels (a2)-(a3)) connected by AFS2 and AFS3. Note that
P3 combined with P4 as one big magnetic patch soon after their emergence. As shown by the
HMI magnetograms and velocity ﬁelds in panels (b1)-(b2) at 05:24 UT, N3, N4, and N moved
westwards at velocities of 0.23 km s−1, 0.22 km s−1, and 0.21 km s−1, respectively. And at
06:13 UT, the velocities rose to 0.38 km s−1, 0.59 km s−1, and 0.29 km s−1, respectively. This
indicates that N3 was pushed by N4 to collided with N. Combining the HMI magnetograms
and Hα observations, FSA2 was located between N3 and N, and launched at the onset of
the collision between these two magnetic patches.

– 7 –

Based on the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds at 05:24 UT and 06:12 UT, we extrap-
olate the 3D magnetic ﬁelds of AR 12700 by using NLFFF modeling. Figures 6(a1) and 6(a2)
show the extrapolation results at 05:24 UT from the top view and side view, respectively. It
is shown that a set of magnetic ﬁeld lines connect P1 and N1, corresponding to AFS1, see
the green curves in Figures 6((a1)-(a2)). To the north of P1, a bundle of nearly open ﬁeld
lines are rooted at another positive magnetic patch (P2). Figures 6(b1) and 6(b2) display
that, at 06:12 UT, another set of magnetic ﬁeld lines connect the dipole (N3/P3) located in
the inner AR, representing AFS2, see the green curves in Figures 6((b1)-(b2)). Adjacent to
N3, a set of magnetic ﬁeld lines with higher altitude are located above a negative magnetic
patch (N), see the pink curves in Figures 6((b1)-(b2)). To some extent, the extrapolation
results are consistent with the observations shown in Figures 2–5.

4. Summary and Discussion

In this paper, we study a new dynamic activity phenomenon, i.e., FSA, which appeared
in emerging AR 12700 on February 26, by using observations from the NVST and SDO. The
two most representative FSAs appeared around 05:21 UT and 06:03 UT, repectively. Each
FSA manifested as fan-shaped feature locating at the footpoint of an adjacent AFS, extending
for up to 11 Mm and lasting for 10-35 minutes. At the decaying phase of the activities, the
fan-shaped features gradually vanished and distinct materials downward motion was detected
on the other end of the relevant AFS. Moreover, photospheric magnetic ﬁelds evolution and
the horizontal photospheric velocity ﬁelds showed that these two FSAs might be associated
with the compression and collision between one end of the relevant AFS and an adjacent
magnetic patch with the same polarity.

As shown in Section 3, the observed FSAs are similar to surges but actually not surges.
Firstly, the plasma of the fan-shaped feature didn’t ejected from the footpoints as the typical
surges do but showed up in the midway. Secondly, observations in the present work haven’t
detected any eruption or brightenings accompanying the FSAs while typical surges usually
coexist with multiwavelength brightenings (Liu & Kurokawa 2004; Nishizuka et al. 2008).
Thirdly, the sequence of magnetograms and velocity ﬁelds showed that the observed fan-
shaped features were related to the compression and collision of diﬀerent patches with the
same polarity. Previous reported Hα surges or chromospheric jets usually are located at
the polarity inversion line (Uddin et al. 2012) or mixed polarity region (Shibata et al. 2007;
Toriumi et al. 2015).

There may be several possible driver mechanisms of the FSA. In this study we pro-
pose two possible interpretations for the FSA formation, one of which is that these two

– 8 –

FSAs may result from the compression and collision between two magnetic patches with the
same polarity. We check the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld evolution during the FSA1 and
ﬁnd that the northern end of AFS collided with the northern patches with the same polar-
ity at around 05:16 UT, likely forming an magnetic interface. The magnetic interface was
probably where the FSA1 lain. Likewise, the FSA2 was also associated with the collision
between two negative polarities.
In addition, at the decaying phase of the FSAs, in the
upper atmosphere shown by Hα observations, we ﬁnd that materials drained down along
the legs of AFS with the projected velocity up to 33 km s−1, which is comparable to the
observations in Gonz´alez Manrique et al. (2018). Previous Hα observations focusing on AFS
detected downﬂows at their endpoints with velocities in the range of 10-50 km s−1 (Bruzek
1969; Spadaro et al. 2004; Zuccarello et al. 2005). The downﬂow indicates the eﬀect of grav-
ity, supporting the idea that the AFS, which is carrying the materials, has been lifted up.
Combining the observations and the NLFFF extrapolation results, we interpret the FSAs
as a result of the deformation and uplifting of one leg of AFS, which are triggered by the
collision and compression between the end of the AFS and an adjacent magnetic patch with
the same polarity.

To better illustrate this collision model, we sketch several cartoons for the case of FSA1
in Figure 7. At the beginning, the AFS is stable, connecting the opposite polarities (P1 and
N1) of a bipole. Then, the positive patch (P1) of AFS shifts northeast and collides with the
northernmost positive patch (P2). Therefore, some magnetic ﬁeld lines of AFS are deformed
and lifted up by the magnetic compression. At the north end of AFS, the initially compact
AFS expands laterally, shaping a fan-shaped feature. Another factor contributing to the
FSA formation may be that the plasma are blocked by magnetic interface, then piled up,
and the density is increased hence visible at Hα wavelength. In addition, materials in the
ﬁelds of AFS fall down to the south end (N1) because of the action of gravity.

Photopsheric magnetic properties including ﬂux emergence, ﬂux cancellation, magnetic
reconnection and shearing are closely associated with diﬀerent solar activities (Zhang et al.
2001, 2007; Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. 2012; Chintzoglou et al. 2015; Kumar et al. 2017; Hou et al.
2018). Recent observations of Chintzoglou et al. (2019) revealed that collisional shearing,
a process during which the collision between nonconjugated polarities of multiple bipoles
results in shearing and ﬂux cancellation, leads to major solar activities. In the present work,
the collision between the same polarities and the eﬀects of this collision are investigated. This
type of collision may drive the dynamic evolution of AFS, and then result in the formation
of FSA, which were observed for the ﬁrst time.

In addition, FSA may also be the result from the reconnection occurring between the
AFS and its overlying ﬁelds. Previous studies have revealed that emerging ﬂux tube can re-

– 9 –

connect with the preexisting magnetic ﬁelds, giving rise to jets or ﬂares (Guglielmino et al.
2010; Vargas Dom´ınguez et al. 2014; Yan et al. 2017). Su et al. (2018) reported that ﬁve
sequential ﬂares are caused by 3D magnetic reconnection at the quasi-separatrix layers as-
sociated with the AFS during the emerging phase of AR 12396. In our case, there are no
brightenings detected in EUV and Hα channels. Thus the reconnection here might be weak
with a small reconnection rate. Zuccarello et al. (2008) argued that they observed weak
reconnection between a new emerging magnetic ﬂux system and the preexisting ﬁelds be-
cause the relative orientation of these two ﬂux systems is ∼12◦. Moreover, Galsgaard et al.
(2007) presented similar numerical experiment results that there is very limited reconnection
occurring between two ﬂux systems that are nearly parallel to each other, and none of the
associated reconnection signatures are detected, such as local brightenings and high-speed
outﬂows of the hot plasma.
