Abstract 

We  present  experiments  demonstrating  trajectory-dependent  electronic  excitations  at  low  ion 
velocities, where ions are expected to primarily interact with delocalized valence electrons. The energy 
loss of H+, H2
+, He+, B+, N+, Ne+, 28/29Si+ and Ar+ in self-supporting silicon membranes was analysed along 
channelled and random trajectories in a transmission approach. For all ions, we observe a difference 
in electronic stopping dependent on crystal orientation. For heavier ions, the energy-loss difference 
between channelling and random geometry is generally found more pronounced, and, in contrast to 
protons, increases for decreasing ion energy. Due to the inefficiency of core-electron excitations at 
employed ion velocities, we explain these results by reionization events occurring in close collisions of 
ions with target atoms, which are heavily suppressed for channelled trajectories. These processes result 
in trajectory-dependent mean charge states, which strongly affects the energy loss. The strength of the 
effect  seems  to  exhibit  a  Z1  oscillation  with  an  observed  minimum  for  Ne.  We,  furthermore, 
demonstrate  that  the  simplicity  of  our  experimental  geometry  leads  to  results  that  can  serve  as 
excellent benchmark systems for dynamic calculations of the electronic systems of solids using time-
dependent density functional theory.

Introduction 

Energy  transferred  by  energetic  charged  particles  to  matter  governs  a  number  of  astrophysical 
phenomena [1] and leads to radiation damage in extreme environments [2]. Detailed understanding 
of the energy-deposition mechanisms allows not only for predicting the mentioned effects but also for 
using  this  process  for  a  number  of  scientific  and  technological  applications  ranging  from  hadron 
therapy for cancer treatment  [3] to materials characterisation and modification [4]. Particularly for 
semiconductors, the use of ion beam irradiations is widely employed to manipulate material properties 
via implantation or controlled defect creation [5,6].  

The energy deposition of ions is commonly denoted by the stopping power S, which is defined as the 
average energy loss per unit path length, i.e. S = -dE/dx. Stopping has been the subject of extensive 
research for decades both by modelling and experiments [7]. Many experimental studies determine S, 
in accordance with its definition, as an effective average along the ion trajectory, often by employing 
amorphous  or  polycrystalline  samples.  Likewise,  several  theoretical  approaches  have  successfully 
predicted S without even taking the atomic or electronic structure of the target material into account 
[8,9]. 

The individual energy-transfer events from ions to target constituents are, however, well-known to be 
impact  parameter  dependent  [10].  So,  despite  the  successes  of averaging  approaches,  the  specific 
nature of energy deposition at the nanoscale can only be understood by going beyond them. From an 
experimentalist’s point of view, an impact-parameter selection can be achieved by employing samples 
with a long-range order, i.e. single-crystals. When an ion travels through a crystal with its direction of 
motion closely aligned with a crystal axis, it becomes subject to the channelling effect. Channelling 
denotes the small-angle scattering of ions by collective potentials of atomic strings at large impact 
parameters,  leading  to  an  oscillating  motion  confined  to  the  channel  [11].  At  high  ion  energies, 
channelling  is  well  studied, and  results  in  enhanced  ion ranges,  i.e.  significantly  reduced  stopping, 
along the channel due to the suppression of core-electron excitations in close collisions (see e.g. the 
reviews by Gemmell [12] and Cohen and Dauvergne [13]). 

At  lower  ion  velocities,  low  meaning  around  and  below  the  Bohr  velocity  v0,  however,  ion-solid 
interactions behave differently than at high ones, also affecting the impact-parameter dependence. 
Core-electron  excitations  become  much  less  efficient,  and  the  interactions  with  target  valence 
electrons  become  non-adiabatic.  A  direct  consequence  is  dynamic  screening  of  the  charge  of  the 
penetrating ion which affects its scattering probabilities. Moreover, charge-exchange events and the 
formation of molecular orbitals [14] directly, and indirectly via altering the mean charge state of the 
ion, affect the energy loss, and again the scattering potential [15]. Additionally, the structure of the 
target  density  of  states  has  to  be  taken  into  account  [16],  although  the  influence  on  electronic 
interactions  is  often  complex  [17,18].  In  particular,  ions  heavier  than  protons  might  significantly 
perturb the electronic system of the target altering the response of the system [19,20]. 

With  the  development  of  time-dependent  density  functional  theory  (TD-DFT),  a  modelling  tool  to 
adequately  describe  these  dynamic  processes  has  become  available  [21].  For  the  sake  of 
computational  simplicity,  these  simulations  are  often  done  for  well-defined  lattices,  i.e. mimic  the 
transmission of ions through single-crystals. Several ion-target combinations have been studied this 
way, e.g. H in Si, Ge and graphite [22–24], Si in Si [25,26], Ni in Ni [27] and W in W [28]; however, a 
comparison to adequate experimental data, i.e. data obtained under exact same conditions using well-
defined samples, is often missing.  

In  a  previous  study  we  have  measured  the  energy  loss  of  slow  protons  and  He  ions  through  self-
supporting  Si(100)  nanomembranes  both  for  channelling  and  random  conditions  [29].  Results  for 

2 

 
protons agree well with previous studies at higher energies, and exhibit an increase of the difference 
between channelled and random trajectories with ion energy due to increasing contributions of core-
electron excitations for close collisions. For He ions, we observed a reverse trend, i.e. an increase of 
the difference between random and channelled energy loss for lower ion velocities. We explained this 
behaviour by collision-induced charge-exchange events resulting in a higher mean charge state of the 
ion, at energies where the equilibrium charge state approaches zero. These charge exchange processes 
lead to a direct energy loss due to electron promotion but more importantly increases the electronic 
stopping along random trajectories. The more complex electronic structure of heavier ions implying 
the possibility for transitions involving multiple electrons plus a larger range of available charge states, 
can be expected to lead to even more pronounced differences. In addition, the electronic stopping of 
slow channelled ions has been predicted to oscillate with the projectile atomic number Z1 by many 
theoretical and experimental studies [30–32]. This oscillation has  also been observed  specifically in 
single-crystalline  Si  [33–36],  even  though  only  one  of  these  works  is  experimental,  and  employed 
samples are not well-defined. For amorphous targets, Z1 oscillations have been observed e.g. in C [37], 
but the amplitude of the oscillation seems to be much reduced compared to channelling geometries. 
Similarly, a recent study on polycrystalline TiN showed, if at all, a very weak oscillation with Z1, in large 
discrepancy to theoretical predictions by DFT [38]. Experiments that study Z1 oscillations for the same 
system  and  under  identical  conditions  for  random  and  channelling  geometry  have,  however,  not 
performed in the named studies. Such a direct comparison between these two cases is expected to 
clarify the trajectory-dependence of electronic excitations and, specifically, Z1 oscillations. 

We have, for these reasons, conducted a follow-up study to [29] investigating the energy loss of B+, N+, 
Ne+, 28/29Si+ and Ar+ ions with velocities < v0 in well-defined and characterised Si(100) nanomembranes. 
We  measure  2D  distributions  of  particles  transmitted  through  the  self-supporting  foil  targets  and 
compare the energy deposition in channelling and random geometries to access the impact-parameter 
dependence of electronic excitation processes. We furthermore compare our results on self-irradiated 
silicon to available TD-DFT calculations. 

2.  Experimental methods 

All  experiments  were  performed  using  single-crystalline,  self-supporting  Si(100)  foils  (Norcada  Inc. 
“UberFlat”  silicone  membranes)  with  nominal  thicknesses  between  50  and  200  nm  as  samples. 
Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (ToF-
ERDA) were employed for characterising sample areal density and purity. For the RBS measurements, 
2 MeV He+ ions provided by the 5 MV 15SDH-2 Pelletron Tandem accelerator at Uppsala University 
were used as probes and backscattered ions were detected at 170° scattering angle with a passivated 
implanted planar silicon detector. To avoid channelling, incidence angles between 5° and 30° were 
chosen,  and  small  rotations  around  this  set  value  were  performed  by  the  acquisition  software  to 
further  randomize  the  alignment.  For  all  measurements  the  beam  current, as measured  on  a gold 
reference, was kept below 5 nA to avoid damaging the foils. The thinnest samples (thickness 53 nm) 
were measured relative to a bulk gold sample. Hereby, the beam was directed onto the reference for 
15 s, then onto the sample of interest for 30 s, then again onto the reference and so on. The number 
of  incident  particles  per  solid  angle  was  consequently  determined  for  the  reference  and  used  to 
evaluate  the  Si(100)  spectrum.   Analysis  to  obtain areal  densities  was  performed  with  help  of  the 
SIMNRA software [39].  The  uncertainty  of  obtained results  is  expected  to  be  better  than  6  %.  For 
samples measured by the relative method described, this uncertainty increases to about 7.5 %.  

3 

 
 
ToF-ERDA measurements were likewise performed with the Tandem accelerator using 36 MeV I8+ ions 
and  detecting  recoiling  target  atoms  at  45°  recoil  angle  [40].  Energy  and  flight  time  of  recoils  is 
measured in coincidence allowing for a separation of light contaminants from the Si matrix. Results 
indicate high purity in the bulk and mainly, H, C and O contamination in accordance with expectations 
of a thin surface oxide and spurious contamination with hydrocarbons.  

All energy loss measurements were conducted with the time-of-flight medium energy ion scattering 
(ToF-MEIS)  system  at  Uppsala University  [41,42].  Ion  beams  are  provided  by  a  Danfysik  implanter 
platform and available energies range from 20 to 350 keV for singly charged ions. Pulsing of the beam 
is performed by an electrostatic chopper combined with a gating pulse resulting in pulse widths down 
to 1 to 3 ns. Several sets of horizontal and vertical slits allow for a restriction of the beam cross section 
to well below (1 x 1) mm2 and a beam divergence significantly better than 0.056° (for comparison, the 
smallest  used  membranes  have  an  area  of  (3  x  3)  mm2).  The  current  incident  on  the  sample  can 
consequently be reduced to 2 – 3 fA only. The base pressure in the experimental chamber is found to 
be below 1 x 10-8 mbar. No specific sample cleaning has been performed  on-site for the presented 
experiments. 

We measured the energy loss of H+, H2
+, He+, B+, N+, Ne+, 28/29Si+ and Ar+ ions through self-supporting 
Si(100). Three different sample thicknesses were used: 53 nm, 135 nm and 200 nm, as obtained from 
the areal densities measured with RBS. Ions are transmitted through the foil, and detected 290 mm 
behind  the  sample  with  a  position-sensitive  microchannel  plate  (MCP)  detector  (DLD120  from 
RoentDek [43]). The position is determined with the help of two perpendicular delay lines, and the 
energy of transmitted particles is measured via their flight time. The circular detector has a diameter 
of 120 mm, corresponding to deflection angles ±11.5°, and covers a solid angle of 0.13 sr. Samples are 
mounted to a 6-axis goniometer allowing not only for precise positioning but also for studying different 
beam-crystal alignments.  

The ToF transmission approach together with the large size of our detector allows for 3D mapping of 
obtained results, i.e. a plot with information on energy and transmitted intensity available for every 
pixel. Details of the evaluation procedure and different available contrast modes are presented in a 
separate publication [44]. Figure 1 shows the energy of transmitted ions as a function of position on 
the detector. In both cases,  29Si+ ions with initial energies of 100 keV  are employed as probes and 
Si(100) foils with 53 nm thickness as samples. The projected position of the incident beam is indicated 
by the small white circle (the innermost in a). The position-dependent mean energy after transmission 
is calculated for bins sized (0.5 x 0.5) mm2. In a, the sample is positioned in such a way that the [100] 
crystal  axis  is aligned  parallel  to  the  incident  beam.  In  this geometry,  the  large  majority  of  ions  is 
channelled, and arrives at the detector at small scattering angles around the incident beam position. 
Some ions experience scattering by larger angles, and are detected in outward regions of the detector. 
These ions are further influenced by the crystalline structure on their outward trajectory, i.e. they are 
subject to blocking and planar channelling. These effects also allow for real-space images of the crystal 
structure. The colour contrast gives the position-dependent energies of ions after transmission, which 
can simply be transformed into energy loss values by subtraction from the initial beam energy. Ions 
exhibit the highest detected energy, i.e. the lowest energy loss, along the channelled trajectory. Energy 
loss increases for larger scattering angles, however, planar channelling leads to energies lying between 
the axial channelling energy in the detector centre and energies measured between the planes. This 
effect results in the star-like pattern visible in the figure.  Note, that the expected energy loss from 
scattering  by  an  angle  equivalent  to  the  half-opening  angle  of  the  detector  including  increased 
trajectory length is expected to increase the energy loss by about 5%.

For the measurement plotted in Fig. 1b, the sample was rotated by 𝜃𝑥 = 6° around the x axis and by 
𝜃𝑦 = 12° around the y axis. Then, the incident beam is no longer aligned with any low-index crystal 
axis, and we call this geometry “random”. Otherwise, experimental conditions are the same as for the 
channelled  incidence.  The  intensity  of  transmitted  ions  does  not  peak  distinctively  around  the 
projected position of the incident beam indicating that more ions undergo scattering at larger angles. 
The energy distribution likewise exhibits a smaller range with a significantly lower maximum than in 
the channelled case. Lower energy loss in the crystal planes and high-index channels near the incident-
beam direction can still be observed. Details of the energy loss will be further discussed in the following 
sections. 

Figure  1:  Position-dependent  energy  of  29Si+  ions  after  transmission  through  a  53  nm  thick,  self-
supporting Si(100) foil. The initial ion energy is 100 keV, and the initial beam position is indicated by 
the small white circle (the innermost one in a). a) the incident beam is aligned with the principal [100] 
crystal axis (channelling geometry). b) the sample has been rotated by 𝜃𝑥 = 6° around the x axis and 
by 𝜃𝑦 = 12° around the y axis arriving in a (pseudo-)random position, in which the beam is not aligned 
with any low-index channel or plane. The annuli drawn into a) visualise regions of interest evaluated 
in Fig. 2. 

The plots presented in Fig. 1 indicate that energy loss differences between trajectories can be assessed 
in two different ways: (i) different regions of interest (ROIs) on the detector corresponding to different 
scattering angles can be evaluated and (ii) the sample can be rotated to compare different incidence 
conditions.  Both  methods  are  employed  in  this  work.  Small  circular  ROIs  around  the  initial  beam 
position (as e.g. indicated by the innermost circle drawn into Fig. 1) can be selected to study rather 
straight trajectories. In order to study exclusively the electronic energy loss contribution, the nuclear 
energy  loss  has  to  be  considered.  Even  assuming  suppressed  nuclear  stopping  due  to  a  strong 
trajectory selectivity in the present approach [45,46], the contribution is not fully negligible for the 
heaviest  projectiles  and  a  random  geometry.  We,  therefore,  perform  simulations  of  transmission 
experiments  using  the  Monte-Carlo  package  TRBS  [47]  to  estimate  the  contribution  from  elastic 
collisions. TRBS allows for modification of the Firsov screening length in the employed Thomas–Fermi-
Molière  potential  [48].  By  setting  this  correction  factor  to  1  %  of  the  standard  value,  trajectories 
virtually without elastic collisions are simulated and can be compared to simulations resembling the 
experiment,  i.e.  including  potential  nuclear  losses.  The  angular  range  of  simulated  transmitted 

5 

 
 
 
particles was chosen to be 0 – 0.8° to consider straight trajectories only, but still achieve sufficiently 
high statistics. After subtraction of the expected nuclear energy loss, the electronic stopping power 
can be determined from the measured energy loss employing numerical integration and assuming a 
E1/2 dependence of the stopping power. For the narrow energy intervals, the inaccuracies introduced 
by a potentially different scaling are expected to be smaller than other experimental uncertainties. 

3.  Results 

We first evaluate energy loss as a function of detection angle for 100 keV 29Si+ ions transmitted through 
53 nm Si(100), i.e. the measurements already presented in Fig. 1. To this aim,  only ions arriving in 
narrow annuli centred around the incident beam position are selected. These ROIs are also drawn into 
Fig. 1a. Resulting energy loss spectra are depicted in Fig. 2. Results for channelling and random incident 
geometry are compared and shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. All curves are normalised to their 
respective maximum value for easier comparison.  

Figure 2: Energy loss  spectra for different deflection angles recorded by transmitting  29Si+ ions with 
initial  energy  100  keV  through  a  self-supporting  53  nm  thick  Si(100)  sample.  The  spectra  in  a) 
(channelled incidence) and b) (random incidence) correspond to the spatial distributions depicted in 
Fig.  1a  and  b,  respectively.  Note  that  each  figure  shows  data  from  one  single  measurement.  The 
different curves are obtained by evaluating different regions of interest on the detector (annuli drawn 
into Fig. 1). The angular ranges given in the legend correspond to the widths of these annuli. All curves 
are normalised to their maximum value. 

Ions incident in channelled geometry and exiting at very small deflection angles (the  yellow curve in 
Fig. 2a) exhibit a very narrow energy distribution and the lowest energy loss of all shown cases. For 
larger angles, the energy loss gradually increases, and the distribution broadens. From around 4° (the 
dark green curve) onwards, the energy loss distribution shows two distinct peaks, which separate more 
clearly for larger deflection angles. For random incidence, the energy distribution is very broad even 
for the innermost ROI. The shape of the distribution does not change with deflection angle and only 
slightly shifts towards higher energy loss for larger angles. A comparison between the darkest curves 
in Fig. 2a) and b) shows that the high-energy loss peak for the channelled-incidence spectrum is located 
at the same position as the random-incidence peak for an equivalent deflection angle of 10°. 

A significant difference in the  energy loss observed along random and channelled trajectories for the 
shown example becomes already apparent from Figures 1 and 2. To study this observation more in 
detail and compare with our previous results for protons and He ions, we evaluate the energy loss 

6 

 
 
 
along rather straight trajectories ending in circular ROIs with 1 mm radius around the initial beam 
position (corresponding to deflection angles ±0.2°) for channelled (∆𝐸ch) and random incidence (∆𝐸𝑟). 
Results for all studied ions, in the form of the ratio ∆𝐸ch/∆𝐸𝑟 as a function of initial ion velocity (given 
in atomic units a.u.), are compiled in Fig. 3. Error bars include the time resolution of the respective 
measurement and the uncertainty in the flight path caused by the finite size of the beam spot and the 
evaluated ROI. Note that the ratio is shown for the measured energy loss, not stopping power. Due to 
the large difference between ∆𝐸ch and ∆𝐸𝑟 and the non-linear energy dependence of the stopping 
power slightly different values can be expected for the latter.  

Figure  3:  Comparison  between  energy  loss  along  channelled  ∆𝐸ch  and  random  trajectories  ∆𝐸𝑟 
denoted by the fraction ∆𝐸ch/∆𝐸𝑟 for H+, H2
+, He+, N+, Ne+,  28/29Si+ and Ar+ ions transmitted through 
self-supporting Si(100) membranes. Data for light ions from [29] (H+ and He+) is shown next to ratios 
obtained for heavier ions with velocities well below v0. Energy loss is evaluated along rather straight 
trajectories by selecting only ions that are detected in small regions of interest around the incident 
beam position (for details see text). 

All ions heavier than protons exhibit a similar behaviour – a strong deviation of ∆𝐸ch/∆𝐸𝑟 from unity 
and mostly a decrease of the ratio for lower velocities. Whereas for the lowest studied He velocity the 
channelled energy loss reaches about 0.82 of the random one, much larger differences are observed 
for heavier ions. As an example,  ∆𝐸ch at the lowest studied velocity corresponding to 60 keV Si reaches 
only 0.27 of ∆𝐸𝑟. The difference does not gradually increase with Z1, however. Instead an apparent Z1 
oscillation is observed with the ∆𝐸ch/∆𝐸𝑟 ratio first decreasing from He over N to Ne and then rising 
again over Si to Ar, when comparing data recorded at similar ion velocities.  A complete quantification 
of this effect is hampered by large deviations between different data points both for Si and Ar though.   

4.  Discussion and conclusions 

The  differences  in  energy  loss  for  random  incidence  but  different  deflection  angles  can  be  well 
explained  by  different  path  length  through  the  sample  and additional  kinematic  losses  in  a  single-
scattering event with the respective scattering angle. For example, SIMNRA simulations for Si in Si 
exhibit a difference of 3 keV between a scattering angle of close to 0° and 10°, in good agreement with 
our observations. The double peak structure for channelled incidence needs an additional explanation 
though.  The  comparison  with  the  random  incidence  curve  at  the  largest  studied  deflection  angle 
indicates that the peak structure featuring a high energy loss consists of ions that have travelled on 

7 

 
 
 
completely random trajectories, i.e. have been dechannelled very close to the sample entry point. Ions 
with lower energy loss must have been dechannelled later, i.e. their trajectories comprise channelled 
parts of various lengths. The clear separation between the two peaks indicates that the dechannelling 
probability  is  not  constant  over  the  channel  length.  We  interpret  this  feature  as  an  increased 
probability for dechannelling close to both surfaces, in particular in both surface oxides. Note that even 
a surface reconstruction, as commonly observed for clean Si(100), would lead to a similar process [49], 
although the magnitude of the effect is expected to differ between the two cases. In other words, a 
large fraction of ions detected at larger deflection angles is dechannelled when entering the crystal 
(high energy loss) and another large fraction when exiting (low energy loss). Figure 1a) also indicates 
the  occurrence  of  planar  channelling,  which  would  constitute  another  trajectory  with  an  expected 
energy loss between the channelled and the random one. The broadening of the distribution suggests 
a mix of different trajectories ending in the same ROI on the detector.  This interpretation, together 
with  the  high  contrasts  of  observed  blocking  patterns  and  the  results  obtained  from  ToF-ERDA 
measurements, also confirms the high purity of and lack of lattice distortions in the crystalline bulk of 
employed samples.   

Figure 4: Comparison of experimental stopping powers of Si in Si with data from TD-DFT. The energy 
loss  of  28/29Si+  was  measured  in  transmission  through  self-supporting  Si(100)  nanomembranes.  For 
details on employed isotope-target thickness combinations see Fig. 3. Purple open diamonds represent 
data measured in channelling geometry whereas for red filled diamonds the sample was rotated into 
a random alignment with the beam. The dashed line gives the prediction from SRIM [50] and the black 
asterisk, measured by Arstila [51], denotes the data point at the lowest energy available in the IAEA 
stopping power data base at the time of writing. The black open asterisk denotes experimental data 
from [33], measured in Si(110), however. TD-DFT calculations (dark blue squares) performed by Lim et 
al. [25] also model the passage of Si ions along the Si [100] axis.    

Finally,  we  want  to  compare  our  results  to  predictions  from  ab-initio  calculations.  Specifically,  we 
compare our data set for Si projectiles with TD-DFT calculations from [25]. The results are shown in 
Fig. 4. Purple open diamonds denote electronic stopping powers obtained in channelling geometry, 
whereas red filled diamonds correspond to a random beam-crystal alignment. The electronic stopping 
power was determined according to the procedure described in Section 2 including the subtraction of 
nuclear energy loss for random geometry. For the case at hand, elastic losses were found to contribute 
between 23 % (lowest energy) and 4 % (highest energy). The figure, furthermore, shows predictions 
from  SRIM  (dashed  line)  and  an  experimental  data  point  from  [51]  (obtained  in  pseudo-random 

8 

 
 
geometry) corresponding to the lowest energy data available in the IAEA stopping power data base at 
the time of writing. The open asterisk denotes electronic stopping measured along the [110] axis from 
[33]. Our data measured in channelling geometry and the TD-DFT calculation that also models the 
passage of Si ions along the [100] axis of a Si crystal show excellent agreement. Electronic stopping 
powers along random trajectories are well predicted by SRIM. The scatter of datapoints at a velocity 
of 0.55 in Fig. 4 is expected to result from an inaccuracy or time evolution in the beam alignment during 
experiments but still features good agreement with predictions on average. Note, that even though 
the relative discrepancy between channelling and random, as visible in Fig. 3, decreases, the absolute 
one increases.    

For slow heavy ions, critical angles for axial and planar channelling are expected to be much larger than 
for H and He. Thus, finding a completely random alignment of the beam for the employed samples is 
experimentally not straightforward. As an example, in Fig. 1b) channelling in a high-index channel close 
to the incident beam position is observed (the high-energy region to the top-right of the white circle). 
In this context, as mentioned above, in Fig. 4, intercomparing the random data points with each other 
and the SRIM data suggests that the low electronic stopping at 0.55 a.u. might not correspond to a 
true  random  stopping,  but  has  been  measured  over  a  partially  channelled  trajectory.  The  ratios 
presented in Fig. 3 for ions heavier than N can, thus, be perceived as upper limits rather than absolute 
values. 

Since core-electron excitations at employed ion velocities are inefficient  (except for protons  at the 
highest employed velocities) and the comparison with Monte Carlo calculations shows that even for 
heavy projectiles, nuclear losses only comprise a minor energy-loss channel, other mechanisms have 
to be the cause for the observed difference between channelled and random trajectories. In [29] we 
propose  that  in  the  case  of  He  ions,  repeated  capture  and  loss  processes  of  electrons  lead  to  the 
measured higher energy loss along random trajectories. Whereas the neutralisation of ions via Auger 
processes happens at any impact parameter, relevant reionisation mechanisms can only occur in close 
collisions  that  are  strongly  suppressed  for  channelled  trajectories.  For  one-electron  processes, 
promotion of electron levels occurring at small impact parameters is known to reduce the He kinetic 
energy by about 20 eV [52]. Two-electron processes require more energy, but are expected to be much 
rarer  [53].  In  both  cases,  this  direct  effect  is  not  sufficient  to  explain  the  much  larger  observed 
differences even for many charge-exchange cycles. Therefore, we suggest that the major contribution 
to the increased energy loss along random trajectories is an increased mean charge state of the ion 
with an additional minor contribution from energy dissipated directly in the excitation process.      

The reported results for heavier ions can be attributed to similar mechanisms as described for He. The 
much  lower  ∆𝐸ch/∆𝐸𝑟  values  are  expected  to  be  caused  by  dynamic  processes  involving  several 
electrons and higher possible charge states. For self-irradiated Si, TD-DFT calculations by Lee et al. 
show indeed a strong dependence of the electronic stopping of channelled Si ions on the initial ion 
charge state [26]. Furthermore, different equilibrium charge states for channelling and off-channelling 
projectiles are reported, thus, corroborating our explanation.   

The observed apparent oscillatory behaviour indicates a different dependence on Z1 of the electronic 
stopping power along channelled and random trajectories. Whereas our available energy range does 
not permit measurements for the exact same velocity for all projectiles, we qualitatively compare the 
oscillation of the electronic stopping power with Z1 for the data points closest to 0.6 a.u. We observe 
an oscillation both  for random and channelling geometry, however, the latter is significantly more 
pronounced. The minimum for Z1 = 10 (Ne) agrees well with previous studies on ions channelled in Si 
that  report  a  pronounced  minimum  in  the  stopping  around 10  or 11.  Analysing  our  results  in  the 
context of existing literature [33,37,38], it can be concluded that Z1-oscillations of electronic stopping 

9 

 
are a consequence of the binary collisions between the non-excited projectile with the valence and 
conduction  electrons  of  the  target,  in  accordance  with  predictions  from  theory  [54].  Projectile 
excitations,  which  become  important  along  random  trajectories,  seem  to  severely  counteract  this 
effect.  With increasing equilibrium charge state, both the amplitude of the Z1-oscillation but also the 
relative discrepancy between the energy loss in channelling and random trajectory is diminishing. The 
latter discrepancy, however, is expected to increase again at elevated energies when the contribution 
of core-electron excitations to the energy loss becomes substantial. 

5.  Summary and outlook 

We  measured  the  energy  loss  of  B, N,  Ne,  Si  and Ar  ions  in  Si(100)  along  channelled  and  random 
trajectories in transmission. We found a significantly reduced energy loss in channelling geometry even 
for  these  low  employed  velocities  below  the  Bohr  velocity.  For  deflected  ions,  this  trajectory 
dependence  leads  to  a  noticeable  splitting  of  the  energy  distribution  of an  initially monoenergetic 
channelled  beam.  We  explained  this  behaviour  by  an  increased  dechannelling  probability  at  both 
surfaces. 

In  contrast  to  higher  velocities,  core-electron  excitations  are  expected  to  be  suppressed  for  all 
geometries. We, therefore, proposed the observed difference in energy loss to be routed in repeated 
electron-capture and -loss processes induced in close encounters with target nuclei available only for 
random trajectories. This mechanism is expected to excite the projectile and significantly raise the ion 
mean  charge  state,  which  leads  to  higher  electronic  stopping  power.  The  strength  of  this  effect 
depends  on  the  projectile  electronic  structure,  and  we  observed  a  drastically  less  pronounced 
oscillation with Z1 for random geometry compared to channelled trajectories. Provided that sample 
surfaces are sufficiently clean, the mean charge state distribution can be accessed by measuring ion 
exit charge states. Experiments of this kind for different crystal orientations could, therefore, help to 
study the observed phenomena further.  

We also showed that the simplicity of our experimental approach together with the high quality of 
employed samples can provide excellent benchmark data for stopping powers calculated with TD-DFT 
for ion velocities below the Bohr velocity where  experimental data is scarce.  Nevertheless, TD-DFT 
codes will need to include charge-exchange mechanisms to accurately predict stopping powers even 
for polycrystalline and amorphous materials.
