Abstract—In this paper, we focus on the convex mutual
information, which was found at the lowest level split in multilevel
coding schemes with communications over the additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Theoretical analysis shows that
communication achievable rates (ARs) do not necessarily below
mutual information in the convex region. In addition, simulation
results are provided as an evidence.

Index Terms—Convex, mutual information, multilevel coding.

I. CONVEX MUTUAL INFORMATION

The study of mutual information (MI) refers to entropies
of the channel input and the noise [1]. This research refers to
those involving transmissions of the multilevel coding schemes
over the memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel, whereat the overall MI is separated with respect to
split signals [2]–[6]. We restrict ourselves to work on the
convex MI which can be found in the previous works [3],
[4], [6].

In multilevel coding schemes, there are several approaches
to split the bit-to-symbol mapping of one modulated symbol
into different levels, each of which constructs a coded mod-
ulation problem based on their individual MIs. The overall
achievable rate (AR) is obtained by the summation of ARs of
all levels and is limited by the MI [3]. With this constraint, In
exchanging for splitting out a higher MI of one level, those
of the other levels must be lower. Consequently, the convex
MI presents with the lowest level at ow signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR).

Since the convex MI suppress the lowest level for its AR
to an insigniﬁcant contribution, it makes sense to circumvent
this upper bound. Hence, we utilize a repeated transmission
method to improve the lowest level. Because that MI of every
level is approximately in straight line at low SNR [7], the
negative effect of the repetition is small.

For showing the problem explicitly, we split the Quadrature
Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) constellation for providing an
example of convex MI in the multilevel coding scheme. The
QPSK constellation is split into two levels in complex plan: a
low level and a high level. The two constellations are shown in
Fig. 1, where the low level mapping is shown in Fig. 1(b) and
the high level mapping is shown in Fig. 1(c). As shown in Fig.
1(a), the alphabet for the QPSK constellation can be denoted

Then (2) can be derived as a function of the given SNR γ

By scaling SNR in the linear manner, numerical results of
(5) are plotted as a function of linear SNR in Fig. 2, where
the convexity of MI for the low level can be found in the SNR
region of γ in [0, 1.5].

To work on the convex problem mathematically, the deﬁni-

tion of convex function is recalled as follows.

We then prove that the AR of low level is higher than the

MI of low level in the convex region of MI.

II. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION
CONFIRMATION

In this section, the theoretical work uses the deﬁnition of
AR in the concept of the transmit bit rate at “arbitrary small”
error probability, and the simulation uses bit error rate (BER)
6 as the approximation of the “arbitrary small” with the
of 10−
AR.

 
 
The theoretical proof is given in the following subsection

and the simulation results are presented next.

The numerical results of (14) are plotted for M = 1, 2, 4, 8

bility of the transmission keeps unchanged when

for γ = γ1/M , where M is a positive integer,
(γ), κ and
γ are the transmission rate of information bits, a constant and
the SNR, and γ1 is the SNR at M = 1, respectively.
Proof: Let us work in AWGN channel model

the AWGN component, respectively, where n

Finally, since (14) holds for the relationship between the MI
of a signal modulation and the AR of the repeated modulate
signal in general, there is an insigniﬁcant difference between
the MI and AR when MI curve is geometrically close to a
straight line. It is lucky that the MI of higher level agrees
with the straight line at low SNR [7, Theorem 1]. This issue
would be in our future interests.

Since the SNRs in (11) and (9) are same, the error proba-
bility of the former is exactly same as that of the latter with,
however, its rate reduction of factor 1/M . Thus, one can ﬁnd
(cid:4)
that (8) holds in general.
Theorem 1: ARs of the repeated low level can be located
in a straight line geometrically drawn from zero to a point of
MI. Thus, there must exist a AR larger than the MI in the
convex region deﬁned by (7).

LDPC codes with the code length of 64800 are selected
from DVB-S.2 standard to simulate the BER performance of
the low level as given in (1), which is obtained by splitting
the QPSK constellation. In simulations, different code rates
are adopted for searching simulated SNR denoted by ˆγ1 for

results of MI. In this ﬁgure, two points of simulated ARs, i.e.,
ARs for the cases that M = 4, 8, are beyond the curve of
the convex MI. SNR gains between simulated ARs and the
convex MI are found at 0.57dB when M = 4, and 1.62dB
when M = 8.

III. CONCLUSION

in
The present work shows that ARs of the low level
multilevel coding are not necessarily limited by the convex MI
with split signals. In the theoretical work, we have proved that
ARs of repeated signals of the low level can be in a straight
line when approaching zero SNR instead of along with the
convex MI of the low level. Simulation results have conﬁrmed
the straight line of the AR and its possibility beyond the MI.
