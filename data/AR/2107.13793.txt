We investigate the inﬂuence of relativistic nondipole eﬀects on the photoelectron spectra of argon,
particularly in the low kinetic energy region (0 eV - 5 eV). In our experiment, we use intense
linearly polarised 800 nm laser pulse to ionise Ar from a jet and we record photoelectron energy
and momentum distributions using a reaction microscope (REMI). Our measurements show that
nondipole eﬀect can cause an energy dependent asymmetry along the laser propagation direction in
the photoelectron energy and momentum spectra. Model simulation based on time-dependent Dirac
equation (TDDE) can reproduce our measurement results. The electron trajectory analysis based
on classical model reveals that the photoelectron which obtains negative momentum shift along
laser propagation direction is caused by the interplay between the Lorenz force induced radiation
pressure during its free propagation in continuum and re-scattering by Coulomb potential of the
parent ion when it is driven back by the laser ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

In strong ﬁeld physics, simple man’s three step model
[1] has been proven to be extremely useful for providing
quantitative explanations to a wealth of highly nonlin-
ear laser-matter interaction phenomena, such as high-
order harmonic generation [2–4], above-threshold ioni-
sation (ATI) [5–7], non-sequenctial double ionisation [8–
10], frustrated tunneling ionisation [11], etc. In this semi-
classical model, the laser-matter interaction happens in
two main stages. At the ﬁrst stage, the target atom or
molecule is tunnel ionised and a free electron appears in
the continuum. At the second stage, the free electron is
driven solely by laser’s electric ﬁeld while the inﬂuence
of the Coulomb potential is neglected.

The predictions of simple man’s model, however, could
not show satisfactory quantitative agreement with the
results of high-resolution strong ﬁeld experiments. For
example, the existence of low energy structure (LES),
very low energy structure and near zero energy struc-
tures in the photoelectron energy and momentum spec-
tra obtained as a result of strong ﬁeld ionisation with
low frequency ﬁelds [12–19] that arise due to the short-
range Coulomb focusing eﬀect, which is an interaction
that is ignored in simple man’s model. Such short-range
Coulomb focusing eﬀects can only be observed when the
free electron is driven back to its parent ion core with a
distance from several tens to 100 atomic units with nearly
zero velocity. Since the Coulomb force scales inversely to
the distance from the core (U ∼ 1/r), the long-range
Coulomb eﬀect is supposed to be much weaker. The
long-range Coulomb eﬀect has been found to signiﬁcantly
aﬀect the emission angle of the streaked photoelectrons
[20] and strongly inﬂuence the zero energy structure of
the photoelectron momentum spectrum [21].

The suppression of LES in case of experiment with cir-
cularly polarised laser ﬁeld led to the speculation that
their origin might be linked with rescattering [13]. In ac-
cordance with the results from circularly polarised laser
ﬁelds, the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE)
results also suggested that rescattering is involved in the
creation of LES. Initial theoretical investigations [22, 23]
attributed LES to be the result of interplay between for-
ward scattering and Coulomb focusing eﬀect, which sup-
ported the proposition of recollision. Another model sug-
gested that the creation of LES is linked with the bunch-
ing of photoelectrons, which miss the parent ion upon the
so-called soft recollisions [24, 25]. The insight into these
low energy features is of great importance for photoelec-
tron holography to determine the structural properties of
the parent ion [26–28] and to explore the time-resolved
tunneling dynamics [20, 29].

In this work, we investigate the inﬂuence of relativistic
nondipole eﬀects on the low energy features of the pho-
toelectron momentum and energy spectra obtained by
using moderately intense linearly polarised near-infrared
laser ﬁeld. These eﬀects become discernible in the form
of an oﬀset in the photoelectron momentum distribu-
tion along the laser propagation direction [30–33]. The
relativistic nondipole eﬀects encompass the short-range
Coulomb focusing eﬀect, demonstrating the breakdown
of strong ﬁeld approximation and also of dipole approx-
imation. In the former approximation, the Coulomb in-
teraction of the photoelectron with the parent ion after
the ionisation is neglected [34, 35]. The later approxima-
tion assumes that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is spatially
uniform on the length scale of the electron motion during
the laser pulse and the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁeld compo-
nent of the laser pulse on the electron motion is negligible
compared to that of the electric ﬁeld component [36, 37].
Breakdown of these approximations gives rise to the rela-
tivistic nondipole eﬀects which induce non-negligible mo-
mentum transfer to the photoelectrons, which ultimately
modiﬁes the low energy features of the photoelectron mo-
mentum and energy spectra.

We present high resolution, ultra-low energy photo-
electron momentum and energy spectra for the single ion-
isation of Ar by few-cycle, linearly polarised laser pulses
(800 nm, 6 fs, 0.8 PW/cm2) under exceptionally clean
experimental conditions. We check normalised asymme-
try of the low energy features in the laser propagation
direction to study the impact of relativistic nondipole ef-
fects on them. We show that the strong kinetic energy
dependence of the asymmetry is caused by the ionisation
phase and thus by the trajectory of the tunneled elec-
tron. For slow electrons, with their kinetic energy close
to zero, the propagation trajectory in the continuum al-
lows these electrons to experience strong Coulomb focus-
ing. We show that such strong interaction can cause a
very interesting kinetic energy dependent peak shifting
and spectral narrowing on the transverse electron mo-
mentum distribution (TEMD). The experimental results
are supported by the truly relativistic ab initio three di-
mensional time dependent Dirac equation (3D-TDDE)
[33].

II. EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM

The experiments were performed with a commercially
available Ti:sapphire laser system in combination with a
reaction microscope (REMI). The laser system delivers
linearly polarised few cycle pulses in the near infrared
(central wavelength 800 nm) at 1 kHz repetition rate.
The inherent ellipticity of the laser pulses was eliminated
by a quarter wave plate (QWP). The pulse duration in
the reaction zone was controlled by compensating the
chirp using a pair of fused silica wedges. The laser beam
was tightly focused to a spot size of 7.25 µm in the re-
action zone inside the ultrahigh vacuum chamber (10−10
mbar) by a silver coated spherical mirror of focal length
75 mm. The laser intensity was controlled by using pel-
licle beamsplitters and was chosen such that only sin-
gle ionisation of Ar remains dominant. The laser beam
along y-axis was crossed by the supersonic gas jet along
x-axis at the laser focus from where the resulting ions and
electrons travel along z-axis/time of ﬂight (TOF) axis to
their respective detectors of the REMI (see Fig. 1). A
half-wave plate (HWP) was used to rotate the polarisa-
tion axis of the laser pulses to TOF axis of the REMI.
The laser intensity in the reaction zone was determined
precisely by the recoil-ion momentum imaging method
within 10% conﬁdence interval [38, 39]. To guarantee
the reliability of our data, laser intensity was constantly
monitored during the experiment with intensity ﬂuctua-
tions less than 5%.

The complete ﬁnal state momentum and energy
distributions of both electrons and ions were recorded
by REMI [40] with a controlled well-deﬁned momentum
resolution. To avoid any obstruction in the electron
spectra, coincident detection of Ar+ ion allows to avoid
any contributions of electrons coming from higher
ionisation states as we consider only those electrons

2

which conserve momentum with Ar+ ion. Moreover, the
space charge eﬀects were avoided by carefully adjusting
the laser intensity and width of the supersonic gas jet in
the reaction zone so that it does not inﬂuence the ﬁnal
electron momentum distribution. A very low electric
ﬁeld (55 V/cm) was applied parallel to the TOF axis
and laser polarisation but perpendicular to the laser
beam and supersonic gas jet direction, which guides the
low energy electrons and ions towards two time and
position sensitive micro-channel (MCP) detectors. A
homogeneous weak magnetic ﬁeld (1.95 G) was applied
to conﬁne the transverse motion of the electrons to
ensure that the electrons with energies less than 30 eV
reach the detector. These low values of electric and
magnetic ﬁeld improved the resolution of REMI such
that we were able to observe the low energy features
with high resolution and clarity.

relativistic nondipole eﬀects on the low energy features of
momentum and kinetic energy spectra

Measurements were taken at two diﬀerent laser in-
tensities for comparison purpose: 0.3 PW/cm2 and 0.8
PW/cm2. The value for the low intensity was chosen
such that the relativistic eﬀects are least prominent (re-
fer to our previously published paper [33]) but can give us
suﬃcient count rate. The maximum laser intensity was
selected so as to avoid obstruction in the photoelectron
momentum spectra as a result of the space charge eﬀect
or multiple ionisation of the gas species.

A. Theoretical model based on 3D-TDDE

To solve the TDDE we follow the procedure described
in [33, 41–43], which we brieﬂy recapitulate here. We
solve the TDDE for the Ar atom in the ﬁeld of a laser
pulse described by the vector potential Az(t − y/c) (the
pulse is linearly polarised in z− direction and propagates
in y− direction):

l(cid:48) in Eq. (5) must satisfy the relation l + l(cid:48) = 2j.

To take into account the non-dipole eﬀects due to the
spatial dependence of the laser ﬁelds, vector potential in
Eq. (4) is expanded in a series of spherical harmonics
at every step of the integration procedure. Substituting
expansion (5) in TDDE (1) and performing some cum-
bersome but straightforward manipulations using well-
known properties of spherical spinors [45], one obtains
a set of the coupled diﬀerential equations for the radial
functions gjlM (r, t) and fjlM (r, t) in Eq. (6). This sys-
tem is solved using a generalisation of the well-known
matrix iteration method (MIM) [46], which we described
in detail in [41].

Diﬀerential ionisation probabilities are calculated as
P (µ, p) = |a(µ, p)|2, where a(µ, p) are the ionisation am-
plitudes (here µ is polarisation (i.e., spin direction in the
electron’s rest frame), and p asymptotic electron momen-
tum). The amplitudes are obtained by projecting solu-
tion of the TDDE after the end of the pulse on the set
of the ingoing relativistic scattering states Ψ−
µ,p(r) of Ar
atom calculated numerically using the model potential
V (r) in Eq. (3). As we are not able to resolve diﬀer-
ent electron spin states in the experiment, we sum our
results for the probability distributions over electron po-
larisation states.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The photoelectron momentum perpendicular to the
laser polarisation plane, also known as transverse mo-
mentum, carries the information about the recollision
event caused by Coulomb focusing of the photoelectrons
[47–52] without being disturbed by the momentum trans-
fer from the laser ﬁeld. Therefore, TEMD is considered
as the most suitable spectrum to explore the inﬂuence of
relativistic nondipole eﬀects on the low energy features.
In addition, the dependence of transverse momentum on
the kinetic energy of photoelectrons provides more in-
sight into the underlying physics.

The photoelectron momentum distribution recorded in
our experiment from the strong ﬁeld ionisation of Ar at
intensity 0.8 PW/cm2 has suﬃciently high resolution to
resolve the low energy features. They are revealed as a
superposition of multiple symmetric patterns about the
polarisation axis. In Fig. 2, we can see that the higher
energy region of the spectrum contains a series of intercy-
cle features in the form of ATI rings, whereas intracycle
fan-like stripes emerging radially outwards in the range
−0.3 < p(cid:107) < 0.3 can be seen in the low energy regions.
The low energy features do not exactly match in Fig. 2
(a) and (b), as the intensity could be slightly diﬀerent in
experiment and simulation, and volume eﬀects which are
not taken into account in the simulation.

molecules to calibrate the transverse momentum oﬀset
[30, 31].

At the intensity 0.8 PW/cm2, it was already expected
and has been already reported that the photoelectrons
show a negative peak shift. As can be seen in the results
from our previous work (Fig. 4), which compares the
experimental data obtained in the intensity range 0.6–
3.0 PW/cm2 with the 3D-TDDE simulation results in the
intensity range 0.5–7.0 PW/cm2, the peak corresponding
to the very low energy electrons continues shifting in the
negative direction with increasing intensity [33].

The comparison of asymmetry as observed in the simu-
lated TEMD along the laser propagation direction at two
diﬀerent intensities 0.3 PW/cm2 and 0.8 PW/cm2 is pre-
sented in Fig. 5. It is evident from the ﬁgure that the mo-
mentum distribution is symmetric about zero momentum
at low intensity Fig. 5(a). However, at a higher intensity,
not only the very low energy electrons are shifted in the
negative direction, but also the tilt of the photoelectron
momentum distribution is quite obvious Fig. 5(b).

A. Momentum/Kinetic energy dependence

The inﬂuence of relativistic nondipole eﬀects on the low
energy photoelectrons can be seen in the plot of trans-
verse momentum Py along the laser propagation direction
vs photoelectron energy, showing the tilting for very low
energy photoelectrons (0–0.5 eV). This tilt is absent for
the transverse momentum Px perpendicular to the laser
propagation direction (see Fig. 3).

The photoelectrons experience strong Coulomb focus-
ing eﬀects due to the rescattering electron trajectories
that correspond to very low energy. As the low energy
photoelectrons typically get ionised at the peak of the
laser ﬁeld and return to the parent ion with close to
zero momentum, therefore they stay longer around the
ion and experience stronger Coulomb attraction. The in-
teraction between the Coloumb focusing and relativistic
nondipole eﬀects leads to the spectral narrowing of the
low energy TEMD with the peak shift in the negative
direction. However, the high-energy TEMD gets broad-
ened with a forward peak shift. This energy-dependent
oﬀset can be used as a self-referencing technique for the
detection and analysis of the relativistic nondipole eﬀect,
without relying on the auto-ionisation of Rydberg state

With increasing intensity, the relative peak shift of the
TEMD increases in the negative direction.

FIG. 5.
Simulation results: Normalised transverse vs longitudinal
momentum spectra at (a) low (0.3 PW/cm2) and (b) high
(0.8 PW/cm2) intensities.

The quantitative analysis of this tilt is performed by
determining the peak position of the transverse momenta
Py along laser propagation direction, integrated over the
energy range 0.2 eV as a function of photoelectron en-
ergy by employing the same procedure as used in [33].
As shown in the Fig. 6, the zero energy or close to zero
energy electrons show a negative peak shift i.e. -3 x 10−3
a.u., which keeps on increasing in the negative direction
for the photoelectrons having energy less than 0.3 eV.
The cause of this negative shift is the strong Coulomb
focusing eﬀect for electrons having close to zero energy.
However, the very low energy photoelectrons in the range
0.3–1.3 eV experience a push in the forward direction be-
cause of the radiation pressure, causing a net peak shift of
6 x 10−3 a.u.. With increasing energy, instead of continu-
ing forward shift the photoelectrons experience a negative
peak shift again. The shift pattern continues to oscillate
from negative–positive–negative shift for the photoelec-
tron having energy greater than 1.9 eV but in a smaller
interval of approximately 1 x 10−3 a.u.. The overall peak

FIG. 6.
The overall Py resolved peak shift is in the forward
direction: 7 x 10−3 a.u. for 0.3 eV electrons increasing to 1
x 10−2 a.u. for 10 eV electrons. However, for very low
energy electrons the peak shift is in the negative direction,
which reverses its direction for the electrons greater than 0.3
eV and then follows oscillatory behaviour with increasing
energy after 1.9 eV.

shift, however, keeps on increasing from 7 x 10−3 a.u. to
1 x 10−2 a.u..

The same trend of the peak shift has been observed
for the simulation results obtained at even higher inten-
sity. Fig. 7 compares the experimental data obtained
at 0.8 PW/cm2 with the simulation results obtained at
1.4 PW/cm2, which reﬂects that the overall shift might
be diﬀerent as a function of intensity. However, close to
zero energy and the very low energy electrons, the main
reason of negative peak shift is due to Coulomb focusing
and hence they behave the same way in this intensity
range.

sured TEMD at 0.8 PW/cm2. An overall tilt in Py in
both (a) simulated spectra and (b) measured spectra is
observed. To highlight the features of interest, we zoom
in the transverse momentum in a narrow range [-0.05
a.u., 0.05 a.u.]. and extract the peak position of the
transverse momentum P⊥ integrated over the momen-
tum range 0.02 a.u.. as shown in the (c) plot. The peak
shift is extracted by the same procedure as described in
[33]. The peak shift is determined by the asymmetry
in the cusp of the TEMD. For this purpose, the func-
tion V (P⊥) ≡ ln W (P⊥) is analysed in a narrow range of
transverse momenta |P⊥| ≤ 0.1 a.u., where W (P⊥) is the
ionisation rate. The experimental data is ﬁtted with the
function V (P⊥) = B + A|Py − β|α by performing a series
of least square ﬁts, where A, B, α and β are the ﬁtting
parameters with β accountable for the peak shift (cid:104)P⊥(cid:105).
The same procedure has been employed to determine the
Py resolved peak shift in Fig. 6.

For zero and close-to-zero energy electrons the peak
shift is negative, which keeps on oscillating between neg-
ative and positive direction with increasing longitudinal
momentum but shows an overall positive shift i.e. a shift
from - 3 x 10−3 a.u. to 4 x 10−3 a.u.. This oscillatory
behavior of the peak shift can be attributed to the pho-
toelectrons with diﬀerent trajectories.

Further investigation on the TEMD along the laser
propagation direction for the low energy electrons (0-1
eV) integrated over the momentum range 0.1 a.u. ob-
tained at 0.8 PW/ cm2 shows quite interesting behaviour.
For close to zero energy electrons (0-0.01 eV) , the TEMD
seems to be symmetric and uniform. However, the wings
of the TEMD start to appear progressively with increas-
ing energy in the range 0.15-0.4 eV, which gradually fade
away leading to a broader distribution after this energy
range. The central peak of the TEMD shifts in the neg-
ative direction for the electrons in the energy range 0.16-

parent ion [53]. This peak shift keeps on increasing in
the negative direction until the electrons gain energy of
∼ 0.36 eV. In contrast, the wings of the electrons are
shifted in the positive direction, since they are formed
by the direct electrons which never get a chance revisit
the parent ion (see Fig 9 (b)). The high energy electrons
with energy greater than 0.36 eV corresponding to short
trajectories contribute to the overall positive peak shift.

features emerge from the intracycle interferences between
the direct photoelectron trajectories and the trajectories
that correspond to hard recollisions [60].

It has been established that the features in the
photoelectron momentum distributions are sensitive
to the laser wavelength and intensity [59, 61]. Since,
we are comparing the momentum distributions at two
quite diﬀerent intensities, the number of ATI-rings and
fan-like stripes as well as their patterns are found to be
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (see Fig. 10). Considering these
momentum distributions are CEP averaged, the features
are found to be symmetric about zero momentum.

CEP dependent momentum distributions

The CEP has profound eﬀect on the photoelectron mo-
mentum distributions. The spectra obtained at two dif-
ferent intensities show quite unique features for each CEP
as shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12.

FIG. 10.

and 0.8 PW/cm2 are as shown in Fig. 10 (a,b). In gen-
eral, these spectra exhibit a number of features, mainly
consisting of intercycle and intracycle interferences. In-
tercycle interferences cause the momentum distribution
to evolve into concentric ATI-rings centered at zero mo-
mentum and are formed as a result of superposition of
electron trajectories corresponding to complex release
time during multiple optical cycles. These rings are
insensitive to the Coulomb potential and their yield
depends upon the direction of photoelectron emission
[54, 55]. Regular carpet-like features are created by the
interference of ATI rings that are separated by a number
of cycles [56]. Intracycle interferences lead to the forma-
tion of fan-like stripes caused by the interference of elec-
tron trajectories within one optical cycle. These include
the direct photoelectron trajectories and the trajectories
corresponding to those electrons which are deﬂected by
the Coulomb potential without experiencing any hard
recollisions [57]. The intracycle interferences are also re-
sponsible for the coherent superposition of distinct states
known as Freeman resonances. These resonant features
are formed as a result of a range of intensities attributed
to the focal volume below the peak intensity [58]. The
pattern of these fan-like features exhibit strong depen-
dence on the wavelength since it inﬂuences the states to
be populated with a particular angular quantum number
(l) [59]. The ﬁne holographic features beside the main

The features are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for diﬀerent
CEP values i.e. not alike nor symmetric, since a spe-
ciﬁc CEP value may enhance the population of only a
particular resonant feature. However, as reported ear-
lier in our previous paper, the eﬀect of CEP on the
nondipole eﬀects is not resolvable within experimental
uncertainty. In order to explore these eﬀects, the peak
shift of the TEMD along the laser propagation direc-
tion was extracted for the sine and cosine pulses, which
turned out to be the much smaller than the experimental
uncertainty [33]. Further investigation based on the sim-
ulation results at 0.3 PW/cm2 and 0.8 PW/cm2 supports
the previous results showing that for diﬀerent CEP val-
ues the peak shift is extremely small especially at lower
intensity (see Fig. 13).

Rutherford scattering process. The drift momentum
gained in the second step is responsible for the particular
trajectories that allows the low energy rescattering and
cause the photoelectron to be strongly focused. Thus,
the negative photoelectron momentum shift is sensitive
to the photoelectron trajectory, and it happens within
one optical cycle.

Classical electron trajectory model:

The validity of this modiﬁed three step model can be
conﬁrmed by performing a pure classical electron trajec-
tory simulation for diﬀerent ionisation times. Experimen-
tally, it can be conﬁrmed by using CEP locked few-cycle
pulse or two-color laser ﬁeld to break the top/bottom

to be diﬀerent for P|| > 0 and P|| < 0.

Here, we have performed a full classical electron tra-

cluding electron tunneling time t0, exit site (0, 0, z0) and
assuming zero initial velocity after tunneling ionisation,
the ﬁnal 3D momentum and position of the free electron
can be calculated by solving the Newton function (9),
where an integration time of 7 optical periods (o.p.) is
used. By scanning the tunneling time t0 and exit site po-
sition z0, we found the negative peak shift of the TEMD

V. CLASSICAL ANALYSIS

To investigate the role of photoelectron trajectories
on the relativistic nondipole eﬀects, a simple physical
picture based on a modiﬁed three step model is pre-
sented. In the ﬁrst step, the electron is ionised close to
the peak of laser electric ﬁeld. In the next step, the pho-
toelectron is accelerated by the driving laser ﬁeld along
its polarisation axis and follows its oscillatory motion
with a constant drift motion given by the laser ﬁeld at
the tunnel exit. Due to this drift momentum, which the
photoelectron possesses when the laser pulse is over, the
photoelectron gets detected at the detector. However,
perpendicular to the polarisation axis, the photoelectron
is pushed along its propagation axis with a constant
velocity due to the Lorentz force. In the third step, the
photoelectron obtains a negative transverse momentum
when it revisits and gets elastically scattered by the
Coulomb potential of parent ion, which is similar to the

ϕCEP= 0ϕCEP= π4ϕCEP= 3π4ϕCEP= π2the electron can gain positive momentum along y-axis.

FIG. 14. (a) The calculated typical electron trajectory with
negative momentum along laser propagation direction, where
the initial exit position z0 = 6.97 a.u., initial velocity vz0 =
−0.184 a.u. and t0 = 2.57 o.p. is used in the classical simula-
tion. (b) The time evolution of the driving electric ﬁeld (blue
dashed curve) and time dependent electron momentum Py.
The point A, B, C in (a) indicates the electron position when
t = 2.57 o.p. (point A in (b)), t = 2.81 o.p. (point B in (b)),
and t = 2.996 o.p. (point C in (b)) respectively.

that corresponds to the electrons having tunneling time
at around the local peaks of the driving electric ﬁeld and
the exit site around z0 = 6.97 a.u..

Fig. 14 shows a typical electron trajectory with nega-
tive momentum shift along y-axis, where the electron is
ionized at t0 = 2.57 o.p. (electric ﬁeld is peaked at 2.5
o.p.), the exit site is (x0 = 0, y0 = 0, z0 = 6.97 a.u.),
and exit velocity is (vx0 = 0, vy0 = 0, vz0 = −0.184 a.u.)
Within half optical cycle, the electron is driven away from
the parent ion and reaches largest ion/electron distance
at t = 2.81 o.p.. After that, the electron is driven back
towards the ion, and gains a positive spatial displacement
along laser propagation direction (y-axis) due to the ra-
diation pressure produced by the laser ﬁeld. At t = 3.0,
the electron is re-scattered by the parent ion and gains a
negative momentum which is opposite to the laser prop-
agation direction. An electron trajectory with positive
momentum along y-axis is possible for electrons which
have not experienced re-scattering. Figure 15 shows a
typical electron trajectory with positive momentum shift
the electron is no longer driven back to its parent ion,

FIG. 15.
Same as Fig. 2, but with ionisation time set as
t0 = 2.43 o.p., the exit site as (x0 = 0, y0 = 0, z0 = 6.97 a.u.),
and exit velocity as (vx0 = 0, vy0 = 0, vz0 = 0.184 a.u.). The
point A, B, C in (a) indicates the electron position when
t = 2.43 o.p. (point A in (b)), t = 2.81 o.p. (point B in (b)),
and t = 4.9 o.p. (point C in (b)) respectively.

VI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have investigated how the low-energy features of
the photoelectron momentum and energy spectra are im-
pacted by the relativistic nondipole eﬀects for ultrashort
linearly polarised near-infrared laser ﬁeld. The measured
and simulated photoelectron momentum spectra for Ar
show very interesting sharp features in the form of ATI-
rings and Freeman resonances due to the inter- and intra-
cycle resonances. Further investigations on the energy-
resolved relativistic nondipole eﬀects reveal an asymme-
It
try or tilt in both momentum and energy spectra.
shows that the central peak shift for the low-energy elec-
trons is always in the negative direction with reference
to the laser propagation direction. However, the high en-
ergy electrons that also form the wings of the TEMD con-
tribute towards the positive shift. Moreover, this peak
shift is found to be oscillating between negative and pos-
itive direction, which can be ascribed to speciﬁc elec-
tron trajectories as explored by classical analysis based

(a)(b)(a)(b)on modiﬁed three step model. The inﬂuence of CEP
on the relativistic nondipole eﬀects has also been investi-
gated, showing that it has a very small eﬀect on the peak
shift of the TEMD such that it is diﬃcult to resolve it
within experimental uncertainty.
