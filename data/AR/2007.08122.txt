We have performed a systematic study of the logf t values, shape factors and electron spectra
for the second-forbidden nonunique β− decays of 24Na(4+) →24Mg(2+) and 36Cl(2+) →36Ar(0+)
transitions under the framework of the nuclear shell model. We have performed the shell model
calculations in the sd model space, using more recent microscopic eﬀective interactions such as
Daejeon16, chiral N3LO, and JISP16. These interactions are derived from the no-core shell model
wave functions using Okubo-Lee-Suzuki transformation. For comparison, we have also shown the
results obtain from the phenomenological USDB interaction. To test the predictive power of these
interactions ﬁrst we have computed low-lying energy spectra of parent and daughter nuclei involved
in these transitions. The computed results for energy spectra, nuclear matrix elements, logf t values,
shape factors, electron spectra and decomposition of the integrated shape factor are reported and
compare with the available experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

The β decay plays an important role in astrophysics
e.g. for the r process [1]. In the nuclear chart, there are
selected candidates for double beta decays, but on the
other hand, there are several potential candidates known
for forbidden beta decay. Out of these, only around 27
possible candidates of second-forbidden nonunique beta
decay is observed as reported in Ref. [2]. Recently, a new
candidate is observed corresponding to second-forbidden
20Ne(0+) from ground-
nonunique decay of 20Fe(2+)
state-to-ground-state transition [3–5]. This study could
change our understanding of the fate of intermediate-
mass stars. The comprehensive review on the theoretical
and experimental status of single and double beta decay
is recently reported in Ref. [6].

In the beta decay based on the value of angular mo-
mentum (l) we can characterize any decay as allowed or
forbidden. The l = 0 decays are called as “allowed” while
the l > 0 decays are called as “forbidden”. Further, we
can divide decays as forbidden unique (FU) and forbid-
den nonunique (FNU). In the case of FU, the total angu-
lar momentum K = l + 1, whereas in FNU decay K = l.
The β decay half-life of the 4th forbidden nonunique
decay of 50V using nuclear shell model is reported in
Ref.
[7]. The 4th forbidden nonunique ground-state-to-
ground-state β− decay branches of 113Cd and 115In using
the microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model and the nu-
clear shell model is reported in Refs. [8, 9]. Also in these
references the half-life method [8] and spectrum-shape

method (SSM) [9] are reported to extract the value of
axial-vector coupling constant gA.

Studies of the forbidden beta decay using the nuclear
shell model with phenomenological interactions are avail-
able in the literature. With the recent progress in the
ab initio approaches for nuclear structure study,
it is
highly desirable to see how these interactions are able
to predict nuclear observables such as forbidden beta de-
cay. Recently, shell model results for allowed beta decay
properties of sd, f p and f pg shell nuclei are reported by
us in Refs. [10–13].

ing ab initio interactions. Beta decay transitions in
these nuclei have been calculated and compared with
the available experimental data to test the quality of
the ab initio interaction wave functions. A theoretical
attempt has been made in the past to calculate the
beta decay transition observable of 36Cl [14]. However,
no theoretical estimate is found in the literature for
the beta-decay of 24Na and also no experimental shape
factors and electron spectra are found in the literature.
Thus, our theoretical predictions for the beta decay of
24Na are useful for the future experiments. In this work,
we have computed the logf t values, shape factors and
electron spectra of these branches. We have constrained
the relativistic nuclear matrix element based on con-
served vector current (CVC) theory and test the role of
this matrix element in the shape factors and electron
spectra. In order to test our computed wave functions,
ﬁrst we have computed the low-lying energy spectra of
24Na, 24Mg, 36Cl, and 36Ar and compare them with the
available experimental energy spectra [15].
This article is organized as follows.

in Sec. IV we draw the conclusions.

In the section (II A), we discuss the theory of forbidden
β− decay, and the shape of the electron spectra. Section

croscopic eﬀective interactions used in the present work.

The full details of formalism for both allowed and for-
bidden types of the β decay are available in the literature
by Behrens and B¨uhring [16] (see also Ref.
[17]). The
generalized framework of the forbidden nonunique β de-
cay theory is available in the Refs. [9, 18, 19]. When the
beta decay process is described as a point-like interaction
vertex with an eﬀective Fermi coupling constant GF, the
probability of the electron emission in the kinetic energy
interval We and We + dWe is expressed as

Where the C(We) is the shape factor containing the
nuclear structure information, and W0 is the endpoint
energy of the β spectrum. The factor F0(Z, We) is the
Fermi function, which takes into account Coulombic in-
teraction between the daughter nucleus and β particle,
and Z is the proton number of the ﬁnal nucleus. Further-
more, pe and We are the momentum and energy of the
emitted electron, respectively.

The partial half-life of the β decay is expressed as

information is contained in the quantities MK(ke, kν )
and mK(ke, kν ), which are complicated combinations of
diﬀerent nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) and leptonic

The nuclear matrix elements are divided in two parts:

is the reduced one-body transition density (OBTD) be-
tween the initial (i) and ﬁnal (f ) nuclear states. The
single-particle matrix elements characterizes the prop-
erties of the transition operators, so they are the same
for all nuclear models. But the OBTDs are the nuclear
model dependent.
In the present work the SPMEs are
calculated using harmonic-oscillator wave functions (see
Refs. [9, 18]). The summation of Eq. (13) runs over the
proton (p) and neutron (n) single-particle states.

The shape factor C(we) (10) can be decomposed into
vector, axial-vector, and mixed vector-axial-vector com-
ponents [8, 9, 21–23] in the form

After the integration of Eq.(14) with respect to electron
kinetic energy, we get the analogous expression to Eq.

In Eq. (14) the shape factors Ci are functions of the
electron kinetic energy, while the integrated shape factors
˜Ci in Eq. (15) are just constant numbers.

B. ADOPTED MODEL SPACE AND
HAMILTONIANS

In the present work shell model calculations for the
low-lying energy spectra, logf t values, shape factors and
electron spectra of the β− decay branches of 24Na and
36Cl were performed in the sd model space. In this frame-
work we have calculated the OBTDs related to the NMEs
of the shape factor. For the sd model space, we have used
the three microscopic eﬀective interactions: DJ16A [24],
JISP16 [25], N3LO [25]. These interactions are obtained
from the no-core shell model (NCSM) wave functions
via the Okubo-Lee-Suzuki (OLS) unitary transformation
[26–28]. We have also compared our results with the
phenomenological USDB eﬀective interaction [29]. The
interaction “DJ16” [24] is obtained from the Daejeon16
N N potential [30]. After the monopole modiﬁcation of
“DJ16”, interaction is labeled as “DJ16A” interaction
[24]. In this work, we have used DJ16A interaction for
further calculations. The OBTDs for NMEs were com-
puted by the shell-model code NuShellX [31]. For the

evaluation of the many-body matrix elements, we have
used the single-particle matrix elements expression given
In our shell-model calculations, we have
in Ref.
used the single-particle matrix elements in the Condon-
Shortley [32] phase convention.

[16].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this section we present our calculated results of low-
lying energy spectra, nuclear matrix elements, logft val-
ues, shape factors, electron spectra and decomposition
of the integrated shape factors for the second-forbidden
nonunique β− transitions of 24Na(4+)
24Mg(2+) and
36Cl(2+)

36Ar(0+).

→

Previously, the logf t values and shape factors of the
second-forbidden beta decay of 36Cl [14] have been re-
ported by applying two diﬀerent nuclear models: with
1d3/2 transitions and shell-model with
the pure 1d3/2 →
sd shell conﬁguration space.

→

Recently, much progress has been achieved in develop-
ing modern eﬀective interactions for the shell model cal-
culations. Thus we have revisited calculation for 36Cl and
also the ﬁrst time for 24Na with recently developed mi-
croscopic (DJ16A, N3LO, and JISP16) and phenomeno-
logical (USDB) interactions in the sd model space. Our
results for 24Na will be useful when compared with up-
coming experimental data.

Below we have presented low-lying energy spectra (
Figs. 1-2), nuclear matrix elements (Table I and III),
logf t values (Table II and IV), shape factors and elec-
tron spectra (Figs. 3-4). The low-lying energy spectra
are discussed in Sec. III A. The β decay nuclear matrix

sented in Sec.

shape factor are discussed in Sec. III D.

A. Low-lying energy spectra

In Fig. 1, we show the low-lying energy spectra of 24Na
and 24Mg. In the case of 24Na, the ground state (g.s.)
4+ is correctly reproduced by USDB interaction, while
the other microscopic eﬀective interactions N3LO, and
JISP16 give the 2+ as a g.s., and DJ16A predict g.s. as
1+. The low-energy spectrum of the well known sd-shell
rotor nucleus 24Mg is already shown in Ref.
[24] for all
the interactions that we have used in the present work.
g.s. and 2+
For 24Mg, the 0+
1 are relatively well described by
all the interactions. The computed 2+
1 state is obtained
at 1.213, 1.310, 1.231, and 1.502 MeV corresponding to
DJ16A, JISP16, N3LO, and USDB, respectively, while
the corresponding experimental value is 1.369 MeV. The
theoretical low-lying energy spectra of 36Cl, and 36Ar
are shown in Fig. 2 in comparison with the experimental
data. The g.s. is correctly reproduced by the microscopic
(DJ16A, JISP16, and N3LO) and USDB interactions for

36Cl and 36Ar. For 36Cl, the order of 3+
1 states
are correctly reproduced from the JISP16, N3LO, and
USDB interactions as in the experimental data, while
the DJ16A interaction invert the order of these states. In
the case of 36Ar, the calculated 2+
1 state from the DJ16A,
JISP16, N3LO, and USDB interactions are close to the
experimental data. So, in general, the comparison of the
computed low-lying energy levels are in good agreement
with the experimental data for 24Na, 36Cl, and 36Ar. In
the present work we have taken Q values from the ex-

perimental data [15] for further calculations listed in the
Table II and IV.

these matrix elements by using OBTDs corresponding
to all microscopic and USDB interactions. After that,
we compare the calculated
MGT with the experimental
data. For the both allowed transitions, the calculated
MGT values from USDB are close to the experimental
data as compared to the microscopic interactions. In the
case of 24Na(4+)

value of
MGT (0.0441) from the DJ16A is very small in
comparison with the experimental data.
The calculated logf t values of allowed β− decays of

For the second-forbidden nonunique β− decays of

be aﬀected by the quenching of axial-vector coupling
constant gA. The aﬀected value of the Gamow-Teller
transition matrix element by the quenching of axial
coupling constant was observed in [33].
In the recent
study of the second-forbidden nonunique beta decay of
20F, the eﬀect of the quenching of axial-vector coupling
constant in axial-vector matrix elements is reported
in Refs.
[3, 4]. Here, we will use the value of the
axial-vector coupling constant for the two diﬀerent
cases, either the bare value of gA = 1.27 or the quenched
value of gA = 1.00.

In the Table IV, we presented the logf t values for the
second-forbidden nonunique β− decays of 24Na and 36Cl
calculated with diﬀerent microscopic and phenomenolog-
ical interactions in comparison with the experimental
data, and the value of coupling constants are taken as
gA = 1.27 and gV = 1.00 for the calculations. The re-
sults with pure shell-model labeled as “SM”, and those
constrained by experimental information, labeled “SM +
CVC”. The prediction of logf t values with SM is far from
the experimental data. However, the agreement between
the calculation with “SM+CVC” and the experimental
value came out to be very satisfactory.

C. Shape Factors and Electron Spectra

In Fig. 3 and 4, we have shown the shape factors
(left panel) and β spectra (right panel) of the second
forbidden nonunique β− decays of 36Cl and 24Na. The
second-forbidden nonunique beta decay of 36Cl is pre-
dicted with strong branching ratio 98.1%, while that of
24Na is predicted with a weak branching ratio less than
1%. These ﬁgures represent the shape factor of Eq. (10)
and β spectrum corresponding to the integrand of Eq. (5)
as a function of electron kinetic energy for diﬀerent mi-
croscopic and USDB eﬀective interactions. For all these
calculations of second-forbidden nonunique beta decay
of 24Na and 36Cl, we have used the experimentally mea-
sured Q value 4147 KeV and 709.547 KeV, respectively.
We have calculated the shape factor by including only the
leading-order terms, and the value of vector coupling con-
stant gV = 1.00 were adopted by CVC hypothesis. We
presented in ﬁgures the purely theoretical results from
the shell model interactions, labeled “name of interac-
tions,” and those constrained from experimental infor-

The areas under both the theoretical and experimental
curves are normalized to unity.

For the shape factor and β spectrum of 36Cl, we have
done a comparison with the available experimental data
due to Rotzinger et al [34] and with the theoretical results
of Sadler et al [14]. In the case of 36Cl, the shape factor
(0)
calculated with the matrix element “V
211 = 0” yields a
poor agreement in comparison to the experimental shape
factor. After constraining this matrix element with the
experimental half-life, the shape factor and electron spec-

β spectrum of 24Na from purely shell model calculation
with quenched and unquenched cases. In the pure shell-
model calculations, the shape-factor and β-spectrum
curves depend strongly on the quenching value of gA.
(0)
After CVC constraining the matrix element “V
211”,
we ﬁnd that the shape factor and β spectrum are inde-
pendent of the value of gA. So, we have presented curve
for “SM+CVC” only for bare gA value. For the compar-
ison, there are no experimental data available for shape
factor and electron spectra corresponding to the second-
forbidden nonunique β− decay of 24Na. Thus, our the-
oretical results might be quite useful to compare with a
future experimental measurement.

D. Decomposition of the integrated shape factor

In Table V, we present the integrated shape factor ˜C
and its decomposition to vector ˜CV , axial-vector ˜CA, and
mixed vector-axial-vector ˜CV A components, for the in-
volved transitions using diﬀerent eﬀective interactions.
Hence, we have calculated the value of ˜C and its com-
ponents with purely shell model labeled “SM” and af-
(0)
ter putting constrained to the matrix element V
211
from experimental information labeled, “SM+CVC”. For

M

all the studied decays transition, the sign of vector ˜CV
and axial-vector ˜CA components is positive from “SM”
and “SM+CVC”, but the sign of mixed axial-vector ˜CV A
component varies. From the pure “SM” for 24Na, the
axial-vector component ˜CA is dominant in the USDB and
DJ16A interactions. For N3LO and JISP16 interactions,
the mixed component ˜CV A is roughly the sum of vec-
tor and axial-vector components and negative in sign. In
“SM+CVC”, the vector component ˜CV is dominant for
all interactions. The mixed component ˜CV A is negative
for USDB, while positive for other interactions. In case
of 36Cl, the vector component ˜CV is dominant for all
the interactions in the case of pure “SM”. After applying
CVC theory, the vector part is dominant only in USDB
and JISP16 interactions and for the other two interac-
tions the axial-vector part is large as compared to other
two components. The sign of the mixed components ˜CV A
are negative in both cases “SM” and “SM+CVC” for all
interactions.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this article we have calculated logf t values, shape
factors and electron spectra for the second-forbidden

→

24Mg(2+) and
nonunique β− transitions of 24Na(4+)
36Cl(2+)
36Ar(0+) using the three microscopic eﬀective
interactions (DJ16A, N3LO, and JISP16) obtained from
the NCSM wave functions via the OLS transformation.
Also, for the comparison, we have used the more popular
phenomenological eﬀective USDB interaction.

→

M

The low-lying energy spectra of the involved mother
and daughter nuclei in β−-decay corresponding to diﬀer-
ent ab initio and phenomenological eﬀective interactions
are compared with the available experimental data. The
obtained wave functions have been used for further cal-
culations. To calculate the logf t values, shape factors
and electron spectra, we have constrained the relativis-
(0)
tic matrix element V
211 in the sd model space by ex-
perimental information. This matrix element plays an
important role in the shape factor and electron spectra.
The calculated logf t values are compared with experi-
mental data. In the case of JISP16 interaction, we could
not obtain a proper value of this matrix element. In our
calculation, we have used two diﬀerent values of gA, ei-
ther the bare value of gA = 1.27 or the quenched value
of gA = 1.00. For the allowed beta decay of 24Na, the
logf t values are in reasonable agreement with the exper-
imental data.
In case of second-forbidden non unique
beta decay, we have calculated logf t values correspond-
ing to gA = 1.27 and compared with the experimental
data. Before CVC theory the electron spectra of 24Na
depend signiﬁcantly on the eﬀective value of gA, while

after CVC it has become independent.
In the case of
36Cl, the dependency of electron spectra on gA is oppo-
site from the case of 24Na for USDB, N3LO, and JISP16
interactions, but in case of DJ16A interaction the elec-
tron spectra strongly depend on gA before and after CVC
theory. In case of 36Cl, the experimental data are avail-
able for shape factors and electron spectra. So we have
compared our theoretical results with the experimental
(0)
data to check the role of matrix element V
211. But in
the case of 24Na, there are no experimental data available
for shape factor and electron spectra. Thus, our calcu-
lated results could be quite useful when compared with
future experimental data. Also, we have decomposed the
integrated shape function ˜C in to vector ˜CV , axial-vector
˜CA, and vector-axial-vector ˜CV A components to see the
individual eﬀect of these components.
