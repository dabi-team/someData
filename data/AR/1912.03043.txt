Heavy ion double charge exchange reactions are described by sequential meson-exchange, corre-
sponding to a double single charge exchange (DSCE) reaction mechanism. The theoretical formu-
lation is discussed. The fully quantum mechanical distorted wave 2-step calculations are shown to
be reproduced very well by approximating the intermediate propagator by its pole part. The role
of ion-ion elastic interactions is discussed. As a ﬁrst application, calculations are performed for the
reaction 40Ca (18O ,18Ne )40Ar at 15 AMeV. Results are compared to the data measured at LNS
by the NUMEN Collaboration. The common aspects of DSCE reactions and double β- decay are
discussed by a detailed comparison of the respective nuclear matrix elements (NME).

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear double charge exchange (DCE) reactions are of
large current interest after it was realized that they give
access to a hitherto hardly explored sector of nuclear ex-
citations. In early DCE studies, the focus was on aspects
of the dynamics of proton and neutron pair transfer [1, 2]
which at that time was thought to be the dominant re-
action mechanism of heavy ion DCE scattering. About a
decade later, Blomgren et al.
[3] attempted to measure
the double-Gamow-Teller resonance (DGTR) in a heavy
ion DCE reaction which, however, at that time was not
successful. Only recently, it was realized that under ap-
propriate conditions DCE reactions are the perfect tool
for spectroscopic nuclear structure investigations [4, 5],
being also of high interest for the nuclear structure as-
pects underlying exotic weak interaction processes. That
change of paradigm relies on the observation that under
appropriate conditions isovector nucleon-nucleon (NN)
interactions will be the driving forces, thus extending the
longstanding experience with single charge exchange re-
actions [6–9] to higher order processes. By obvious rea-
sons, that conjecture can be explored the best by periph-
eral coherent reactions with complex nuclei, leading to
2 ﬁnal states. A
ejectiles with particle-stable ∆Z =
distinct advantage of heavy ion scattering over the for-
mer (π+, π−)-DCE reactions [10–12] is the much easier
experimental availability and handling of ion beams.

±

In this work, we propose a new reaction mechanism
for peripheral heavy ion DCE reactions at energies well
above the Coulomb barrier. We investigate the condi-
tions under which such reactions can be described as a

double single charge exchange (DSCE) process, driven
by collisional NN interactions, thus extending our inves-
tigations in Refs. [13, 14] to higher order processes. We
will not consider transfer DCE which, in fact, has been
found to be negligible for the reactions considered here
[15, 16]. A formalism is developed for the description of
DCE reactions by two consecutive ∆Z =
1 SCE steps.
In a DCE reaction, however, the SCE processes are con-
tributing oﬀ-the-energy shell as intermediate processes.
Hence, their description requires special attention. An
important point is the proper treatment of the strongly
absorptive elastic ion-ion interactions for which we use a
microscopic optical model potential. The spectroscopic
aspects are described by Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)
and Quasiparticle Random Phase (QRPA) theory follow-
ing the microscopic approach presented in [13].

±

As a new aspect, we consider here the connection of
DCE reactions and second order weak processes. An al-
most natural weak counterpart is 2ν2β decay. We will
show that the DCE reaction amplitudes have a striking
similarity to the nuclear matrix elements (NME) of 2ν2β
decay. While the latter are rare events, heavy ion DCE
reactions can be studied frequently under well deﬁned
laboratory conditions.
In particular, the feasibility of
measuring a heavy ion DCE reaction has been recently
proved, on the example of the reaction 18O +40Ca
18Ne
+40Ar at E/A = 15 AMeV, indeed hinting towards a di-
rect mechanism [17]. A complication to be dealt with in
a DCE reaction is the convolution of the SCE spectra of
the intermediate projectile- and target-like nuclei. Since
that occurs at half oﬀ-shell conditions, the knowledge of
the corresponding on-shell SCE cross sections is only of
limited advantage. On the theoretical level, the prob-

The DCE reaction mechanism is assumed as a sequence
of two uncorrelated SCE events, each one mediated by
the action of the isovector NN-interactions, acting be-
tween projectile and target and leading to pn−1 and np−1
particle-hole excitations or vice versa, respectively. After
the ﬁrst SCE event the system propagates undisturbed
until the second interaction. Thus, the reaction proceeds
as a double single charge exchange process, which by the
number of separate projectile-target interactions is a two-
step reaction [22, 23].

The reaction matrix element, connecting incident and
ﬁnal channels is readily written down as a quantum
mechanical amplitude in distorted wave approximation
(DWA):

discussed below, although inevitably hampered by a cer-
tain degree of model dependence – as is true for SCE
reactions with light and heavy projectiles as well, where
appropriate methods are available for the extraction of
single–beta decay NME [13, 18–21].

The paper is organized as it follows: In section II the
theoretical framework for DSCE reactions is presented.
Two descriptions are discussed which emphasize diﬀer-

The paper closes with a summary, conclusions, and an

property by the convolution of two on-shell SCE ampli-
tudes which, in principle, are accessible in SCE reactions.
However, in practice this would mean to identify SCE
transition up to high excitation energies of close to 100
MeV.

As seen below, Eq.(11), leads to an astonishingly good
reproduction of the full two-step DW cross sections.
However, for the sake of a deeper insight into the essen-
tials of the DSCE reaction mechanism, further reductions
are extremely valuable. For example, additional steps are
necessary for the extraction of spectroscopic information
out of measured cross sections, because from Eq.(11) the
relation of the DSCE reaction amplitude to projectile and
target nuclear matrix elements is not immediately clear.
A caveat is the presence of initial state and ﬁnal state
interactions. We also note that although the intermedi-
ate SCE amplitudes appear to be of DWA-type, they are
in fact half–oﬀ–shell quantities which as such cannot be
measured independently.

In order to quantify those eﬀects a separation of elastic
ion-ion interactions and nuclear structure eﬀects is help-
ful. In momentum representation, the SCE amplitudes
are given as [13]

B. The Convolution Approach

The Cauchy principal value parts of the DSCE am-
plitudes have the tendency to be suppressed because of
compensating positive and negative contributions. To a
good approximation, they can be neglected and we may

acting in projectile (k=1) or target (k = 2), respectively,
have been introduced. Expressions for rank-2 spin-tensor
interactions are found in [13].

Elastic ion-ion interactions are accounted for by the

which can be considered as an oﬀ-shell extension of the
S-matrix, approaching in the plane wave (PW) limit

N
cients were investigated in detail for SCE reactions. For
the present case, it is important that
αγ can be decom-
posed into a forward component, given by an absorption
factor nαγ and a residual distortion form factor which
we neglect in the following. Hence, we use in forward
scattering approximation

That leads in Eq.(10)to a product of two distortion
residues and the dual S-matrix. The absorptive eﬀects
from the intermediate channels are cancelled to a large
extent by the dual S-matrix which allows to replace the
product of the two distortion coeﬃcients and the dual
γ, appropri-
S-matrix by the residue Nαβ =

by which one can separate nuclear and reaction dynam-

approximation as in Eq.(11). Finally, at small momen-

matrix elements by replacing the PW amplitudes

coming α and the outgoing β channel, but retaining the

C. The Separation Approach

In this section, an approach is presented which allows
the separation of the DCE reaction amplitude into a nu-
clear structure and a reaction part by exploiting the dis-
torted wave completeness relation. That requires to go
somewhat deeper into the multipole structure of DCE
reaction amplitudes. The SCE transition form factors,
expressed as a function of the distance between projec-
tile and target centers of mass, read:

They are expanded into multipole form factors

(18)

where angular momentum coupling coeﬃcients involving
the nuclear spins are not shown explicitly, but for which

we refer to Ref.
[13]. The A-coeﬃcients contain the
remaining coupling of the projectile and target multi-
poles to the resulting total angular momentum transfer
λ with projection µ. The form factors are parameterized
in terms of transition amplitudes βSλk and reduced form
factors of unit transition strength:

In the energy denominator, we replace kγ by an average

An irreducible representation is obtained by further cou-
pling the two reduced form factors to total angular mo-
menta. Thus, the DCE process is described by a reduced
DW reaction amplitude fully accounting for the reaction
dynamics. The two-step character of the DCE process
leads to the special kind of form factors. The nuclear
structure aspects of the sequential DCE process are con-
tained in the spectroscopic density combining the SCE
response of projectile and target. The β-amplitudes are
related to the reduced beta-decay matrix elements in the
same way as known from the so-called collective model
for inelastic scattering [24]. Theoretically, they are ﬁxed
by the nuclear SCE response functions as fractions of
multipole sum rules which in parallel determines also the
reduced form factors USλµ [25–27].

III. RESULTS

A. Numerical details

The theory is of general applicability without con-
straints neither on the kind of transition nor on the multi-
polarity. In the reaction calculations, microscopic optical

potentials are used. They were obtained by folding the
Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov (HFB) one-body ground-state
densities of projectile and target with the isoscalar and
isovector parts of the (anti-symmetrized) NN T-matrix
of Ref.[28]. As discussed in [13, 14] QRPA calculations
are performed to evaluate the SCE projectile and target
transition densities. The projectile and target transition
form factors were obtained by folding the QRPA transi-
tion densities with the central and rank-2 tensor parts of
the anti-symmetrized NN T-matrix of Ref. [28]. All fold-
ing calculations were done in momentum representation.
Two kinds of reaction calculations were performed:
The full partial wave two-step formalism, as discussed
e.g. in [25–27], was used in solving the set of inhomoge-
neous scattering equations by direct numerical integra-
tion, as available by the computer code FRESCO [29].
These results serve as benchmark calculations for the ap-
proximations discussed in section II. In parallel, indepen-
dent calculations using the perturbation theoretical for-
malism were performed: Single charge exchange form fac-
tors, the DWA reaction amplitudes, and the correspond-
ing cross sections were calculated by our standard DWA-
SCE computer code package HIDEX [30]. As found in
Ref.[13], the calculation of the SCE reaction amplitudes
requires a quite involved angular momentum algebra to
couple the intrinsic nuclear angular momenta to the re-
sulting total orbital angular momentum, by which the
multipolarity observed at the level of the cross section is
determined. In general, one ﬁnds

We start following the convolution approach. For the
sake of simplicity, to check the quality of our calculations
and to investigate the relevance of the distortion eﬀects,
we ﬁrst include only one single intermediate channel. In
particular, we consider the transition with total angular
momentum and parity transfer J π = 1+ for both projec-
tile and target nuclei, leading to the ground state of 18F
and to the ﬁrst excited 1+ state at Ex = 2.29 MeV of
40K. These states correspond to the Gamow-Teller tran-
sitions discussed in Ref.[13]. The SCE amplitudes were
used to construct the second order integral of Eq.(11)
which was evaluated numerically. An instructive exer-
cise is to compare results of calculations in plane wave
approximation (PWA) and in DWA, giving insight on
the eﬀects of elastic ion-ion interactions in DCE reac-
tions. In Fig. 2 we show the angular distributions ob-
tained by second order PWA and DWA calculations for
the reaction considered. That ﬁgure contains a number
of important messages for future research on heavy ion
DCE reactions. First of all, ISI and FSI eﬀects suppress
cross sections by many orders of magnitudes as a result of
10−5. As dis-
the strong absorption, showing that Nαβ
cussed in [13], the quenching will increase rapidly with
increasing target and/or projectile mass. The suppres-
sion decreases with incident energy which, however, at

∼

 
 
realistically accessible energy scales hardly compensates
the mass-dependent quenching. One can also observe
that our numerical calculations, based on Eq.(11), i.e.
adopting the PA (dashed lines), reproduce quite well the
FRESCO results (full lines).

The results show a strong inﬂuence of the optical model
potentials on the diﬀraction structure of angular distri-
butions, superimposing those reﬂecting the reaction form
factor properties.
In Fig. 2, this is realized by com-
paring the DWA results (dashed red line) to the results
which were obtained considering plane waves in the in-
termediate channel (dot-dashed blue line). The latter
calculation is able to reproduce the DWA cross section
at very small angles, but exhibits a quite ﬂat angular dis-
tribution. These results indicate both the virtue and the
limitations of the scaling approach, Eq.(16): At vanish-
ing momentum transfer, the magnitude of the full DWA
two-step cross section is rather well described, but the
scaling approach is unable to account for the diﬀraction
structure at larger momentum transfer, thus restricting
that kind of approach to extreme forward angles.

We now move to discuss the results obtained consid-
ering an extended spectrum of intermediate states. We
have taken into account intermediate transitions up to
5±, for both 18F and
J π
Ex = 15 MeV and 0±
40K, see [13] for more details. It has been checked that
this choice leads to convergent results. Calculations have
been performed following the (more easy to handle) for-
malism provided by Eq.(22), where energy conservation
has been imposed to determine the average value ¯k. Re-
sults are shown in Fig.3 and compared to the NUMEN
experimental data, where the theoretical angular distri-
butions were folded with the experimental angle resolu-
tion. The DWA results of Fig.2, with only one inter-
mediate state, are also shown for comparison. By the
inclusion of the full spectrum of intermediate channels,
the calculations come close to the data without addi-
tional adjustment. However, the diﬀraction structure of
the DWA angular distributions is more pronounced than
observed experimentally, which is the cause for the slight
apparent underestimation of the data at certain forward
angles. With all care, these remaining discrepancies may
indicate contributions of processes of an origin diﬀerent
from the DSCE reaction mechanism, e.g. the two-nucleon
scenario discussed in [14].

IV. NUCLEAR MATRIX ELEMENTS AND
RELATION TO DOUBLE–β–DECAY

On the formal level, the DSCE amplitudes have much
in common with the NME of 2ν2β decay because both
are of the same kind of second order perturbation the-
ory. There are no strong reasons that the Single State
Dominance (SSD) assumption, found to work well for
2ν2β decay, must hold also for heavy ion DSCE reactions.
Quite contrary, despite of the fundamental diﬀerences in
the dynamics, sequential DCE reactions are surprisingly

similar to what is expected for 0ν2β decay. For example,
the measured angular range in Fig.3 covers in fact mo-
mentum transfers up to qαβ
400MeV/c, implying that
the intrinsic system must support these large momenta.
This resembles the conditions found in theoretical stud-
ies of 0ν2β decay, see e.g. [31]. In this sense, heavy ion
DCE reactions are of a hybrid character, covering aspects
of both kinds of double-beta decay.

∼

Irrespective of those ambiguities, the extraction of nu-
clear matrix elements oﬀ the cross sections is a key task
of DCE spectroscopy. For SCE reactions the NME–
extraction directly from data relies on the deﬁnition of a
so-called unit cross section meant to include at the given
incident energy besides kinematical factors the SCE in-
teraction strengths and distortion factors [13, 20]. While
that concept is comparatively easy realized for both light
and heavy ion SCE reactions, some eﬀorts are required
for a DCE reactions. Here, we elucidate the unit cross
section problem for two extreme scenarios, namely the
SSD assumption and the case of a spectral distribution
without a dominant state.

Let us assume that the target-like SCE spectra A

B are dominated by a transition into and out
of a single state R. Then, a decent approximation is
to restrict the summation over the channel states C to

These examples indicate the following interesting lead-

ing order scheme:

If SSD is valid in one of the nuclei, in that nucleus
a product of two SCE-NME of one-body operators
into and out of the dominating state R is obtained,
together with a DCE-matrix element describing the
transition into the ﬁnal
= 2 conﬁguration of
|
the other nucleus directly by an eﬀective rank-2
isotensor two-body operator – see Eq.(26).

∆Z

|

If SSD applies to both nuclei, for each of the nuclei
products of two one-body SCE-NME into and out
of the states r and R are found – see Eq.(29),

If SSD does not apply in both nuclei, the transitions
in both nuclei are given by matrix elements of ef-
fective isotensor two-body operators – see Eq.(30).

In all cases, the NME’s are components of spin-spin ten-
sors which are contracted with the matrix of second or-
der DCE interaction form factors V SS
αβ . According to
Eq.(28), the matrix V SS
αβ depends on the kinematics and
Q-values of the reaction. The elements of that matrix are
understood as eﬀective coupling constants for the various
non-spinﬂip and spinﬂip transitions contributing to the
DCE excitations in projectile and target.

An interesting observation is made for those cases
where SSD does not apply: For S = S′ = 1 the
= 2 NME’s are determined by a double GT-
∆Z
|
στσ′τ ′ which can be decomposed
operator (DGTO)
into spin-operators of multipolarity λ = 0, 2 accompa-
nied by a rank-2 isotensor operator. Hence, the DGTO
will contribute to the excitation of the DGTR and the
Double Isobaric Analog State (DIAS), and in connection
with a p-wave interaction, also to excitations of double
spin-dipole modes. The DGT-type of operator is un-
der active scrutiny in sum rule studies of double exci-
tations of charge exchange modes [32–36]. Correspond-
ingly, the double-Fermi operator (DFO) encountered for
S = S′ = 0 is of interest for investigations of the DIAS
mode.

A. Nuclear Matrix Elements and Unit DCE cross
sections

Last but not least, we indicate brieﬂy the connection of
DCE cross sections to nuclear matrix elements. As an
important common feature of the reaction amplitudes,
the separation into the matrix of second order interac-
tions and nuclear matrix elements was derived, resulting
in the structure:

ther analysis as emphasized by the discussions in the pre-
vious sections.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

Heavy ion double charge exchange reactions have been
investigated with the focus on the reaction dynamics
of this special class of two-step reactions. The reac-
tion mechanism was described as a double-SCE reac-
tion given by two consecutive SCE reaction steps which
are promoted by the projectile-target residual isovector
NN-interaction. The DCE reaction amplitude was con-
structed accordingly as a second order distorted wave
matrix element. Broad space was given to disentangle
nuclear matrix elements and ion-ion initial and ﬁnal state
interactions. As a ﬁrst application of the theory, the DCE
reaction 18O + 40Ca

18N e + 40Ar was investigated.

The DSCE reaction amplitude, Eq. (10), has the for-
mal structure of a matrix element in second order pertur-
bation theory, describing here the next-to-leading-order
contribution of the a + A residual isovector interactions.
Hence, on the formal level, the DCE amplitude resem-
bles the NME of 2ν2β decay.
In order to understand
that connection on the quantitative level, the NME of
DCE reactions were studied. The central message is that
DCE reactions cover at the same time dynamical aspects
typical for 2ν2β and 0ν2β decay.

We emphasize that excitations of DCE modes will pro-
ceed in general by mixtures of S = 0 non-spinﬂip and
S = 1 spinﬂip transitions, thus lifting the strict selec-
tion rules known for SCE transitions. One reason is that
the ﬁnal nuclear conﬁgurations in projectile and target
are of 2p2h-character with respect to the parent nuclei
which allow a broad spectrum of interactions. Thus, the
simplicity of SCE reactions, allowing to extract single-
beta decay NME from cross section data, is not main-
tained in the same way for DCE reactions. Accessing
DCE-NME’s in full detail requires to consider additional
observables which are sensitive to the spin-character of
the transitions. This does not exclude exceptional, yet to
be discovered cases where special conﬁgurational proper-
ties are enhancing a certain spin channel.

Signiﬁcant simpliﬁcations occur when one considers
speciﬁc cases, such as 0+
0+
gs transitions both in pro-
jectile and target. Illustrative results have been presented
in this case, together with a comparison to available ex-
perimental data.

gs →

DCE processes are determined by many new aspects of
nuclear structure and reaction dynamics which have not
been under scrutiny until now. Both experiment and the-
ory are entering into hitherto unexplored territory, posing
unexpected challenges but opening a new ﬁeld of nuclear
research. In a forthcoming paper, a competing DCE reac-
tion mechanism will be studied resembling the non-SSD
case of Eq.(30) but of diﬀerent dynamical origin [14, 23].
In [37] a new approach to DCE processes, based on an
extended version of the IBM, was presented. An impor-
tant message of the present work is that heavy ion DCE
reactions are indeed the ideal tools to scrutinize nuclear
DCE models under realistic conditions. Our results are
encouraging systematic studies in this direction.
