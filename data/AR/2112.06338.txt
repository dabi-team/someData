Abstract 

It is generally accepted that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grew from progenitor seeds; but 
it remains unclear when the seeds formed, how massive they were, and what were their growth 
rates. This study finds answers to such pressing open questions in an analysis and interpretation of 
available mass (MBH) and age (t) data of high-redshift (z>5.7) SMBHs. Their distribution reveals 
that a significant number (36) of SMBHs spread in age over ~300Myr (million years) of cosmic 
time have markedly similar masses even though MBH depends on t. Besides t, MBH is a function of 
seed mass MS, origin time tS, and a variable dubbed the accretion ratio AR. The analysis leads to 
the conclusion that AR=45λ/t with λ constant and that these SMBHs had similar-size seeds that 
formed essentially concurrently. Consequently, we get 36 equations defining MBH as a function of 
t  with  3  parameters.  Solving  the  equations  using  the  SANN  method,  the  optimum  values  of 
parameters  λ  and  tS  define  AR  as  a  function  of  t,  and  MBH  as  a  function  of  MS  and  t.  These 
relationships are tested and applied to thousands of SMBHs at lower redshifts. The results indicate 
the  following:  1)  tS ~100  Myr  (z~30).  2)  High-z  SMBHs  >  109M☉  (solar  mass)  require  seeds 
>103M☉ but <5x104M☉, and those size of 5x106M☉ at z~0 grew from seeds of a few solar masses. 
3) Seeds grew at an exponentially increasing rate that reached a maximum near z=7 and decreased 
thereafter. 4) Seeds may have initially experienced a ~150Myr period of super-Eddington accretion 
or accretion efficiency much <0.1. 5) About half of the growth occurs from z=30-3.5 and the rest 
thereafter. 6) Accretion has been the predominant mode of growth of SMBHs with an upper limit 
of ~2.2x106MS or MBH < (6.7+2)1010M☉. The study provides quantitative estimates of accretion 
rates, constraints for models of seed formation, and insights into the probable origins and growth 
of Sagittarius A*.

1. Introduction  

More  than  200  actively  accreting  supermassive  black  holes  (SMBHs)  or  active  galactic  nuclei 
(AGN) have now been found at redshifts z >5.7 [e.g. 1,2,3,4]. The largest of these SMBHs exceed 
1010M☉ solar masses [5] and the most distant thus far has been detected at z=7.64 [6] when the 
universe was only ~676 million years (Myr) old. It is generally accepted that these SMBHs grew 
from  much  smaller  seeds  formed  at  earlier  epochs  or  higher  redshifts.  It  is,  however,  an  open 
question when these seeds formed and how massive they were; nor is it clear whether these seeds 
formed concurrently or over a period of several hundred million years and what their growth rates 
were. These are some of the pressing questions in cosmology about the origins and properties of 
black hole seeds [7]. 

Current models for the formation of black hole (BH) seeds envision the following. Formation of 
massive (~104-106M☉) DCBHs or direct collapse BHs from the collapse of pristine gas clouds in 
dark matter halos [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Relatively small (~102M☉) stellar remnant seeds formed 
[14, 15, 16] at z>20. And formation of intermediate size (~103M☉) seeds via run away collisions 
in dense stellar clusters [17, 18, 19] at z~10-20. Clearly, these models envision the formation of 
BH seeds at different epochs of the early universe spanning more than 300 Myr. And the debate 
concerning  the  size  of  seeds  needed  to  account  for  the  observed  masses  of  SMBHs  is  further 
muddied by a recent claim [20] that SMBHs >109M☉ can conceivably grow from seeds as small 
as 10M☉ via chaotic accretion under certain conditions. 

This paper finds answers to such pressing open questions independent of all models of BH seed 
formation  and  not  dependent  upon  assumptions  concerning  radiative  efficiency,  duty  cycle  of 
luminous  accretion,  and  Eddington  ratios.  It  is  the  culmination  of  a  chance  discovery  of  an 
intriguing pattern in the mass distribution of high-z SMBHs that begs an explanation. Plotting the 
mass distribution of 38 high-z SMBHs compiled by Chon [21], I noticed that a large group had a 
common feature. Within this group, the SMBHs had rather similar masses at markedly different 
redshifts. To ascertain that the observed pattern was indeed valid and not dismissible by invoking 
uncertainties in the determinations of BH masses or insufficiency of data, I searched the literature 
and compiled a list of 59 quasars with known uncertainties in the determinations of their masses. 
The  BHs  range  in  mass  over  2.5  orders  of  magnitude  and  cover  ~300  Myr  of  cosmic  time. 
Arguably, it is to date the most comprehensive list of high-z SMBHs whose masses are known and 
generally well constrained. Their mass distribution confirmed the pattern gleaned from the data 
compiled by Chon [21], in that 36 of them have markedly similar masses within a factor of 2 of 
2x109M☉ but have different ages covering the entire time span of ~300 Myr. 

The obvious question is why these BHs of different ages have similar masses when a BH’s mass 
is known to be a function of its age. The so-called Salpeter relation holds a plausible answer. Its 
generalized version [see e.g. 20] defined by Eq.1 expresses mass MBH of a BH as a function of the 
mass MS of its seed, accretion period Δt or the time difference between BH’s age t and time ts of 
the inception of its seed, and a variable AR dubbed the accretion ratio and defined in Eq.2. 

MBH = MS exp [AR (Δt /45Myr)]    

(1)

The accretion ratio AR is a function of radiative efficiency ε, the duty cycle of luminous accretion 
δ,  and  LE  =LAGN  /LEDD  the  average  Eddington  ratio  or  the  ratio  of  AGN’s  luminosity  to  its 
Eddington luminosity averaged over an AGN’s life span. 

AR = (0.1/0.9)δLE (1-ε)/ε ~ 0.11δLE (1-ε)/ε     

(2)  

For δ =1, ε=0.1, and LAGN =LEDD, AR =1 and Eq. 1 reduces to the so-called Salpeter relation for a 
BH accreting at the Eddington limit. Note that AR is ∝ to the average Eddington ratio  LE, and 
therefore dubbed the accretion ratio. Moreover, LAGN = ε (1-ε)-1c2 ṀAGN, where ṀAGN is a BH’s 
accretion rate and c the velocity of light; and LEdd is directly proportional to MBH. Substituting 
these relationships in Eq.2, we get AR ∝ to the average δṀAGN/MBH or the product of δ and the 
normalized accretion rate averaged over a quasar’s life span. Furthermore, ṀAGN depends upon 
the ambient gas density and a BH’s gravitational reach or it’s MBH. As z decreases gas density 
decreases, and hence ṀAGN/MBH should decrease with z and the probability δ that the BH will 
remain in an active state should also decrease. Therefore, AR should decrease with z or that AR is 
probably an inverse function of  t. Besides t, Eq.1 has 2 other variables: seed mass MS and inception 
time tS. Analyzing the observed distribution of the SMBHs in the context of Eq.1, it is concluded 
that the 36 SMBHs had similar size seeds (within a factor of ~2) that formed essentially at the 
same epoch and that AR is indeed an inverse function of BH age t. Hence, the variables MS and tS 
in Eq.1 for this group of BHs are near constants and AR is defined as an inverse function of age 
with a proportionality constant λ. Thus, we get 36 equations with one variable (t) and 3 parameters 
(MS, tS, λ) that are constants or near constants. The 36 equations are solved using the “SANN” 
method given in Belisle [22]. Substituting the resulting values of tS and λ in Eq. 1 and 2, we get 
two empirical relationships: one defining AR as a function of age t and the other defining BH mass 
as a function of t and seed mass MS. The two empirical relationships are extensively tested and 
applied to thousands of SMBHs at nearly all redshifts. No internal inconsistencies are found and 
the results agree with existing observational data and theoretical considerations where applicable. 
Thereafter, I discuss the results pertaining to the sizes of seeds necessary to account for masses of 
SMBHs >106M☉, their implications for models of seed formation, quantitative estimates of BH 
growth through cosmic times, the importance of BH merger versus accretion, and implications for 
the origins and growth of Sagittarius A* and the AGN that might exist in CR7. 

Throughout this paper, the redshifts are converted into cosmic age t using the Hubble constant (H
☉=67.4  km/s/Mpc)  and  matter  density  parameter  (Ωm =0.315)  determined  by  the  Planck  group 
[23]. A SMBH is defined as a BH >106M☉. An actively accreting BH is alternatively referred to 
as  a  quasar  or  an  AGN.  High  redshift  BHs  are  those  at  z  >  5.7  and  low  redshift  at  z  <5.  The 
accretion ratio AR is a function of BH’s accretion rate per unit mass averaged over Δt or a quasar’s 
life time. 

2. Mass distribution of high-redshift SMBHs 

I searched the literature for high redshift (z >5.7) AGNs whose masses are known. Although more 
than 200 such AGNs have thus far been discovered, the masses of less than one-third are known. The 
search was helped by two previous compilations. Chon’s doctoral thesis [21] available online lists 
the z and MBH of 38 such AGNs discovered until the end of 2017. Shen et al. [24] lists 50 high-z BHs 
whose  redshifts  were  recalculated.  Based  on  the  sources  cited  by  [21]  and  [24]  and  additional 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
intensive research of AGNs discovered until the end of 2021, I compiled a list of 59 BHs shown in 
Table 1. A few BHs whose masses are poorly constrained were excluded. For example, two different 
determinations of the mass of CFHQS J 2229+1457 differ by more than an order of magnitude [25]. 
Mass determinations using MgII were given preference over CII determinations. For each AGN, its 
redshift as reported in the discovery paper and the currently available best estimate of its mass along 
with its uncertainty are shown. The cited uncertainty does not take into account any systematic errors 
that may exist. Both sources are cited for those BHs where the redshift is from the discovery paper 
(first citation) and the mass from a different source (second citation). I checked the original redshifts 
of  this  sample  against  those  recalculated  by  [24]  and  did  not  find  any  significant  differences 
amounting to more than a few Myr. In 10 cases, the BH mass in Table I differs from that shown in 
Chon  [21].  There  are  two  reasons  for  these  differences.  First,  I  chose  the  best  available  estimate 
irrespective of the source, whereas Chon generally gives the mass as originally estimated. Second, 
De Rosa et al. [26] used 2 different equations to estimate BH mass: one uses an equation applicable 
to low-z quasars and the other more appropriate for high-z quasars. I chose the mass estimate obtained 
from  the latter more appropriate equation and used the difference between the two estimates as a 
rough measure of the uncertainty; whereas Chon apparently cited the mass determined by the other 
equation. The average reported 1σ uncertainty in the masses of the 59 BHs in Table I amounts to 
~28% of a BH’s mass or ~0.11dex. 

Figure 1 shows the mass and age distribution of the 59 SMBHs and Fig.2 shows a histogram of their 
masses. The BHs range in mass over ~2.5 orders of magnitude from a low of ~3.8x107 M☉ to a high 
of ~1.24x1010M☉; and their ages span from 676 - 971 Myr corresponding to redshifts from 7.64 to 
5.78 covering a time span of ~300 Myr. Obviously, the 2 figures do not reflect a complete picture of 
the mass distribution of BHs in the early universe simply because smaller SMBHs are difficult to 
detect  at  high  redshifts.  Nevertheless,  the  2  figures  reveal  an  intriguing  distribution,  in  that  a 
significant number of BHs of differing ages have markedly similar masses. Despite the fact that the 
BHs range in mass over ~2.5 orders of magnitude, Fig. 2 shows that a large group or 36 of them have 
masses in the bin 109 M☉ to 5x109 M☉ or within a factor of 2 of 2x109M☉. These BHs are shown as 
blue squares in Fig.1. The rest have masses outside this narrow range; those in red triangles have < 
109 M☉ and those in red circles have > 4x109 M☉. The density contours and age distribution in Fig. 1 
clearly show that BHs with rather similar masses (blue squares) are not restricted to a narrow segment 
of the ~300 Myr cosmic time of the early universe, but span its entire length. Their density, however, 
decreases  at  higher  redshifts  or  younger  ages.  This  again  most  likely  is  an  artifact  of  detection 
capability. Nevertheless, it is clear that these BHs with vastly different ages have strikingly similar 
masses.  This  finding  cannot  be  explained  away  either  by  invoking  uncertainties  in  their  ages  or 
redshifts and their masses or by insufficiency of data. As noted earlier, multiple determinations of 
redshifts differ at the most by a few Myr of cosmic time. Also, the average 1σ uncertainty in the 
determination of the masses of these 36 BHs is ~22% except for one BH (#33, Table I) for which it 
is  much  larger.  And  the  detection  of  additional  high-z  SMBHs  in  the  future  cannot  change  the 
observation  that  a  group  with  widely  different  ages  have  strikingly  similar  masses;  a  finding  that 
demands an explanation. A few of the quasars denoted by red triangles having masses close to 109M
☉ could be included in the blue square’s group because of uncertainties in the determination of their 
masses.  Their  inclusion,  neither  changes  the  observation  that  BH’s  of  different  ages  have  similar 
masses, nor does it materially change the ultimate results.

The obvious question is why these BHs of vastly different ages have similar masses when MBH is an 
exponential function of age (Eq.1). Besides age, MBH depends upon seed mass MS, inception time tS, 
and AR the accretion ratio (Eq. 1). Since  MBH is  directly proportional  to  MS, the relatively small 
factor  of  2  variations  in  the  MBH  of  the  36  BHs  can  ostensibly  be  accounted  for  and  ascribed  to 
corresponding (factor of ~2) variations in MS. Hence, MS for this group is apparently a constant within 
a factor of ~2. A BH’s mass MBH, however, is an exponential function of the product of the accretion 
ratio AR and the accretion period Δt. Therefore, the observation that these BHs of differing ages have 
similar masses requires that either: 1) these BHs had almost identical AR and Δt; or 2) that the product 
of AR and Δt is nearly constant. The accretion ratio AR, however, is a function of the BH’s Eddington 
ratio (Eq. 2) that is observed to vary by almost a factor of 10 from ~0.1 to 1 for high-z SMBHs [24]; 
and  accretion  period  Δt  for  BHs  that  differ  drastically  in  age  cannot  conceivably  be  a  constant. 
Therefore, the product of Δt and AR has to be nearly constant, or that AR is inversely proportional 
to the accretion period Δt or a BH’s age t. Note that AR ∝ 1/t is not an exclusive property of the 
group of 36 SMBHs, but applicable in general to SMBHs as concluded earlier in the introduction. 
It is highly unlikely that a relationship between AR and t could exist if the seeds formed at drastically 
different epochs. Therefore, the inevitable conclusion appears to be that the 36 BHs had similar-size 
seeds (within a factor of ~2) that formed essentially concurrently and that AR is an inverse function 
of age. Hence, for this group of BHs the variables MS and tS are reduced to near constants and AR is 
an inverse function of BH age t. If so, BHs in red circles (Fig.1) should have had substantially larger 
seeds and those in red triangles significantly smaller seeds than those in blue squares, assuming that 
they too formed essentially at the same time as the group of 36. That this is indeed the case is shown 
later.  

3. Quantitative empirical relationships 

The mass and age data of the 36 SMBHs provide 36 equations defining BH mass as a function of age 
t (as in Eq.1) with only 3 parameters. Based on the conclusion reached above, the accretion ratio is 
defined as AR=45λ/t, where the parameter λ is a constant and age t in Myr. The other 2 parameters 
are the mass (MS) and formation time (ts) of the seeds. The “SANN” method given in Belisle [22] with 
10 million iterations was used to optimize parameter values. Several sets of model parameters were 
generated using the data for the 36 BHs, allowing all 3 parameters to be free and fixing time tS to be 
100,150, and 200 Myr. Computations with tS=150 and 200 gave the largest RMS residuals and were 
rejected. As expected, the smallest BHs had the largest positive residuals (predicted minus observed 
mass) and the largest  had the largest  negative  residuals; a result consistent  with  the inference that 
deviations in BH masses from the mean are the result of corresponding deviations in seed masses MS 
from its model mean value. Consequently, to better constrain the model parameters, a subset of 29 
BHs with masses within a narrower window of 1.2x109M☉ to 3.7x109M☉ was used. The subset did 
produce significantly smaller RMS residuals; and a smaller subset with a still narrower mass window 
produced yet smaller RMS residuals. Allowing all 3 parameters to be free, we get MS =5x103M☉ for 
both sets, but λ=14 and tS=65 for the full set, and λ=14.4 and tS=82 Myr for the subset of 29 BHs. 
Constraining tS=100 Myr we get MS =5.47x103M☉ and λ=14.55 for the full set, and MS=5.37x103M☉ 
and λ=14.66 for the subset. The various results show that the model median value for MS for this group 
of BHs is well constrained to 5-5.5x103 M☉, but the value of λ co-varies with tS. The subset results, 
however, indicate that tS is close to 100 Myr and neither much earlier or much later. For lack of an 
additional criteria to further constrain tS, I chose tS=100 Myr  which incidentally happens to be the 
value assumed in recent studies of BH growth [e.g. 50,20] and corresponds to the time when the first 

4 

 
 
generation of POP III stars may have formed [51]. The corresponding mean value for λ using both 
sets of data for tS=100 Myr is λ=14.6+0.06. Figure 3 shows residuals (predicted minus observed MBH) 
expressed as a percentage of observed mass for the model mean value of MS=5.4x103M☉. As expected, 
the results show a correlation between residuals and MBH. In general the model parameters over predict 
(positive residuals) the mass of BHs smaller and under predict (negative residuals) of BHs larger than 
the mean value of 2x109 M☉; an outcome consistent with the inference that the observed variations in 
MBH are the result of corresponding deviations in MS from its mean value. 

Using the model value of λ, we get Eq.3. And since 1/t is proportional to (1+z)3/2 for high z [52], AR 
is also expressed as a function of z using the cosmological parameters of the Planck group [23]. 

AR = 14.6 x 45/t (Myr) ~ 0.038 (1+z)3/2                                     

(3) 

Substituting AR=14.6x45/t in  Eq.1 we get  an  empirically determined relationship  between a  BH’s 
mass MBH, its age t, and its seed mass MS, where Δt = t – tS and tS=100 Myr. 

MBH = MS exp (14.6xΔt /t)                            

(4) 

And using the approximation 1/t is proportional to (1+z)3/2 for high z, we also get Eq.5 where z is the 
BH’s redshift and zS of its seed. 

MBH = MS exp 14.6 [1 - (1 + z)3/2 / (1+ zS)3/2]                

(5) 

It is worth emphasizing that the foregoing relationships are not based on the selection of an arbitrary 
set  of  data  or  on  any  assumptions  about  radiative  efficiency,  duty  cycle  of  luminous  accretion, 
Eddington ratios, or how large the seeds might have been and when they might have formed. The 
question is whether these relationships are valid in general for the rest of the high-z BHs and those at 
low  redshift  down  to  z~0.  Earlier,  we  found  that  in  all  likelihood  AR  ∝ 1/t  in  general  and  not  an 
exclusive property of the set of 36 BHs. Furthermore, MBH is an exponential function of the product 
of AR and accretion period Δt (Eq.1). If AR did not decrease as Δt increases, then MBH should grow 
exponentially as z decreases. For example, MBH should increase by 50 times or more from say z =6.3 
to z <2.3 if the BH continues to accrete. The largest BHs observed to date at z<2.3 (discussed later), 
however, are only a few to ~5 times larger than the largest high-z BH (#31, Table 1). Hence, AR has 
to decrease with z for Eq.1 to be valid at low redshifts. The best way, however, to test Eq. 3, 4, and 5 
is by applying them to SMBHs at lower redshifts down to almost zero and to all high-z SMBHs. The 
high-z SMBHs that differ in mass from the group of 36 obviously had seeds with masses different 
from those in the group of 36. Hence, in general MS is a variable in Eq. 4 and 5 and not a near constant 
as for the group of 36. The group of 36 were deduced to have formed essentially concurrently at z~30. 
There is no reason to assume that the rest of high-z SMBHs, and hence those at low z, formed at other 
epochs  if their masses  can be accounted for with  variations in  their seed masses  MS. Therefore, in 
general tS in Eq.4 or zS in Eq.5 can safely be assumed to be constants at tS=100Myr or zS=30. The next 
section discusses the results of the application of these equations to thousands of SMBHs at z<5 and 
all high-z quasars.

4. Testing the empirical relationships 

4.1 Application to high-z SMBHs 

Equations  4  and  or  5  were  applied  to  all  59  high-z  SMBHs.  Table  2  shows  the  results  for  a 
representative sample. It illustrates the range of MS needed to account for the masses MBH of specified 
groups of BHs as well as for individual BHs from the largest to the smallest. The uncertainty (1σ) in 
MS for individual BHs results from the 1σ uncertainty in MBH specified in Table 1. It is heartening to 
note that the MS for the group of 36 BHs (Row1, Table 2) are largely within a factor of ~2 of the model 
median value of ~5.4x103M☉. In contrast, the range of MS for all 59 BHs (Row 2) spans >2 orders of 
magnitude in accord with the observed range of MBH in Table1, The results in Table 2 clearly show 
that the masses of BHs > 109M☉ cannot be accounted for with seeds as small as 10M☉ as proposed by 
Zubovas  and  King  [20].  They  require  seeds  >103M☉  but  not  exceeding  ~4x104M☉,  taking  into 
consideration a 2σ uncertainty in the mass of the largest high-z SMBH (#31) known to date. On the 
other hand, the smallest high-z SMBH of known mass observed to date (#27) requires a seed mass of 
~102M☉. Black holes much smaller than #27 would require much smaller seeds. For example, Eq. 4 
and 5 indicate that seeds with stellar masses of 4-10M☉ at z=30 would grow to BHs with masses of 
~106 - 4.6x106 M☉ by z= 6.36 or the age of ~860 Myr. No actively accreting SMBHs with masses in 
the range of 106-7 M☉ have thus far been detected at z >5.7 except possibly for one in CR7 (discussed 
later). Quasars with such masses are, however, observed near z~0. 

 By definition AR is a function of ε, δ, and LE (Eq.2). For the commonly used values of ε=0.1 and δ=1, 
the  accretion  ratio  AR=LE  the  average  Eddington  ratio.  Hence,  AR  values  for  the  high-z  quasars 
determined using Eq.3 should in general be compatible with Eddington ratios ER of high-z quasars 
reported in the literature if ε ~ 0.1 and δ ~1. A BH’s LE inferred from its AR, however, is not directly 
comparable to its ER because a BH’s LE is its ER averaged over its life span in contrast to its spot 
value corresponding to its age reported in the literature. And since AR decreases with z (Eq.3),  LE 
values inferred from AR should in general be > ER values. Shen et al. [24] calculated the ER for 50 
high-z SMBHs, and found that all except possibly two that are poorly constrained had ER <1, ranging 
from 0.1-1. Applying Eq.3 to the 59 high-z quasars, we get AR ~0.68-1; a result not inconsistent with 
the observational ER data for high-z quasars. 

4.2 Accretion ratio AR as a function of BH age 

Equation 3 indicates that AR decreases with z from ~1 at z=8 to a low of ~0.04 at z~0. Such a marked 
decrease in AR cannot be accounted for by varying accretion efficiency within reasonable limits or 
the duty cycle (Eq.2), but apparently requires a decrease in ER with z. While the ER of quasars at 
similar redshifts inferred from their bolometric luminosities may differ widely depending upon local 
conditions, a systematic decrease in ER with z if any should be reflected statistically in large samples 
of  ER  of  quasars  at  different  redshifts.  Ascertaining  whether  ER  indeed  decreases  with  z  is 
complicated by the dependence of ER upon the assumptions used for bolometric correction factor [e.g. 
53] and whether the sample is fully corrected for completeness [54]. Bearing in mind these difficulties 
and  fully  cognizant  that  it  remains  an  open  question  that  needs  to  be  fully  investigated;  I  cite  the 
following  studies  that  together  suggest  that  ER  probably  decreases  with  redshift.  Shen  et  al.  [24] 
obtained  a  median  value  of  ~0.32  with  a  dispersion  of  ~  0.3dex  for  ER  of  a  high-z  sample  of  50 

12 

 
 
  
  
  
 
  
quasars.  In  comparison,  Shen et  al.  [55] obtained ER  mean values ranging  from  ~0.079-0.25  with 
typical widths of < 0.3dex for AGNs in different redshift luminosity bins at z ~4.5-0.1. In fact, Schulze 
and Wisotzki [56] noted a redshift dependence of ER in the [55] data. They noted that restricting the 
[55] sample to z ≤ 0.3 gives a lower mean ER of ~0.067 with a dispersion of ~0.43dex. Furthermore, 
Kelly et al. [54] found that compared to previous work their inferred ER for a sample of 9886 quasars 
at 1< z < 4.5 corrected for completeness is shifted towards lower values of ER peaking at ~0.05 with 
a dispersion of ~0.4 dex. Also, Willott et al, [39] found a marked difference in the distribution of ER 
at z=2 and z=6, with the latter quasars accreting in general at higher ER than the former. And notably, 
Kozlowski [57] lists 37 quasars within a narrow z window of ~ 0.492-0.345 that have a mean ER 
value of ~0.0046 with 80% having ER <0.01. This mean value for quasars at very low redshifts is 
almost  2 orders of magnitude lower than the mean ER  value of ~0.32 obtained by [24] for high-z 
quasars. Also, the reported ER for high-z quasars are all or nearly all > 0.1, whereas ER for AGNs at 
1< z <2 determined by Suh et al. [58] cover a much wider range down to as low as 0.001; which too 
is  indicative  of  a  possible  statistically  significant  dependence  of  ER  on  redshift.  Lastly,  since 
ER=LAGN/LEDD, where bolometric luminosity LAGN is directly proportional to a BH’s accretion rate 
and the Eddington  luminosity  LEDD to  a  BH’s mass [e.g.59], the implied decrease in  ER  with  z is 
consistent with an expected decrease in a BH’s accretion rate as the gas density decreases with z and 
an increase in its LEDD as the BH mass increases with age (see Eq.1). 

4.3 Maximum mass of a SMBH 

Equations 4 and 5 indicate that there is an upper limit to the mass that an actively accreting BH can 
attain. A BH approaches this limit as it ages and its redshift approaches zero. The upper limit is a 
function of seed mass MS and is ~ (exp14.6)MS ~ 2.2x106MS. This is a future potential upper limit 
when strictly Δt /t=1 (see Eq.4). The maximum mass accreted by a BH by z=0, however, is slightly 
less at ~2x106MS. Table 1 lists 2 BHs >1010M☉ (#31and 59). More than 20 years have passed since 
the first (#59) and ~7 years since the second (#31) was discovered. It is likely that these 2 quasars 
represent the upper limit on the size of quasars that existed in the early universe. In fact, [24] reached 
a similar conclusion. The larger of these 2 BHs (#31) is inferred to have had a seed mass with a 2σ 
uncertainty of (3.03+0.92)104M☉ (see Table 2). Hence, such a BH could potentially grow via accretion 
to a maximum size of ~(6.67+2)1010M☉ If this high-z BH indeed represents the upper limit on the size 
of BHs that existed in the early universe, Eq. 4 and 5 imply that the largest BHs observed to date at 
lower redshifts should not significantly exceed this upper limit. The largest BH observed to date whose 
mass is apparently well constrained is TON 618 at z=2.219 with a mass of 6.6x1010M☉ [60] at an age 
of ~2.95 billion years (Gyr). Table 3 lists several other SMBHs >1010M☉ at redshifts down to z~0. 
And among the hundreds of thousands of SMBHs at z<2.3 listed by Kozłowski [57], there are 4 that 
could possibly be somewhat larger than TON 618, but the uncertainties in the determination of their 
masses are either undefined or very large. Clearly, the masses of the largest BHs observed to date are 
at  or  below  the  empirically  determined  upper  limit  of  (6.67+2)1010M☉,  and  there  is  no  credible 
evidence that a BH exceeds this limit significantly. Furthermore, this empirically determined upper 
limit  is  in  excellent  agreement  with  the  limits  determined  theoretically  on  physical  grounds.  It  is 
comparable  to  the  likely  limit  of  ~5x1010M☉  and  less  than  ⅓  the  maximum  potential  limit  of 
~2.7x1011M☉  proposed  by  King  (2016),  and  less  than  the  upper  limit  of  ~1011M☉  proposed  by 
Inayoshi and Haiman (2016). 

13 

 
 
  
  
  
4.4 Application to SMBHs at z <5.7 

Another way to test the validity of Eq. 4 and 5 is to apply them to low redshift (z <5) SMBHs (>106M
☉)  and  compare  the  resulting  seed  masses  MS  to  those  deduced  above  for  high-z  SMBHs.  The 
SMBHs, whether currently observable or not, that once existed in the early universe grew with time 
and are observed at lower redshifts.  Equations 4 and 5 indicate that the masses of high-z SMBHs 
(>106M☉) can be accounted for with seeds ranging from a few times M☉ to a maximum of ~4x104M
☉.  The  range  of  MS  needed  to  account  for  the  masses  of  low-z  SMBHs  should  in  general  be 
comparable to this range for high-z quasars. Equations 4 and 5 were applied to thousands of BHs at 
z <5 down to almost zero. The results are illustrated in Table 3, where the first 7 rows show the MS 
for individual BHs and the succeeding 5 rows show the range of MS for different groups of BHs in 
different  mass  and  redshift  bins.  The  1σ  uncertainty  in  BH  mass  where  known  and  the  resulting 
uncertainty in MS are shown in brackets. Clearly, the range of MS for the largest to the smallest BHs 
at z~4.7 to z~0 (rows 1-7) is comparable to the range of MS for the high-z SMBHs discussed above. 
In particular, note that the Ms for the largest 4 SMBHs (rows 1-4) are within or marginally higher 
than  the upper limit of ~ 4x104M☉ for high-z quasars, and for the smallest SMBH (Messier 61) at 
z~0 is a few times the sun’s mass. The last 5 rows show the number of BHs in each group, the BH 
mass and z range of the group, and the inferred range of MS needed. Together the 5 groups cover 
roughly 2 orders of magnitude in MBH from ~ 2.6x108 - 3.2.x1010 M☉ comparable to the range of 
masses of the high-z SMBHs in rows 4-8 in Table 2. The MS for the groups of low-z BHs range from 
~3.8x102- 2x104M☉ comparable to the range of ~6.2x102- 2.2x104M☉ for MS for high-z BHs (see 
Table 2). In conclusion, Eq. 4 and 5 derived from the data for high-z quasars are apparently applicable 
to SMBHs at lower redshift down to z~0, and the seeds needed to account for the masses of SMBHs 
observed to date range from a few solar masses to ~ < 5x104M☉. 

5. Implications  

5.1 Black hole seeds: sizes, timing and models of formation  

The results indicate that the seeds of SMBHs formed at or near z=30 when the universe was ~100 
Myr old and not much earlier at higher redshifts or much later at lower redshifts, whereas the 3 models 
of seed formation cited above apparently envision different epochs of seed formation. Moreover, the 
results show that the masses of high-z BHs >109 M☉ cannot be accounted for with stellar-mass seeds, 
but require seeds ranging from ~2x103 M☉ to ~4x104 M☉. Seeds >105 M☉ as envisioned in the DCBH 
scenario, however, are not required; which might help relax the conditions necessary to form DCBHs. 
On the other end of the BH mass spectrum, the results indicate that SMBH as small as 5x106 M☉ at 
z~0 require seeds no larger than a few solar masses. The first generation of metal free POP III stars 
may have formed as early as z=30 [51], but their remnant BH seeds are generally thought to have had 
masses of the order of ~102 M☉ [71]. If the smallest BH seeds are remnants of POP III stars, then 
POP III stars would have to have formed at sizes much smaller than those responsible for BH seeds 
of hundreds of solar masses. More recent studies [72] in fact show that POP III stars less than the 
Sun’s mass can apparently be formed. If so, BH seeds ranging in mass from ~ Sun’s mass to several 
hundreds of solar masses could be the remnants of POP III stars.

Thus,  it  appears  that  the  seeds  of  SMBHs  may  well  be  POP  III  remnants  and  small  DCBHs  that 
formed essentially concurrently when the universe was ~100 Myr old. Apparently, DCBHs require 
flow of pristine, metal free gas into DM halos [e.g. 8]. At this early epoch of z~30, it is unlikely that 
gas  would  have  been  contaminated  with  metals  released  by  first  and  second  generation  stars.  If, 
however, a gas cloud is slightly contaminated, hydro dynamical simulations by Chon and Omukai 
[73] show that the fragmentation of the cloud results in the formation of thousands of small stars and 
a few massive stars, ranging in mass from less than M☉ to ~104 M☉ that could grow larger with time 
and form the seeds of SMBHs. This mechanism dubbed the “super competitive accretion” by Chon 
and Omukai [73] could alternatively account for the range of seed masses needed for SMBHs >106 
M☉. 

5.2 Seeds of BHs of Milky Way and CR7 

The least massive of the 59 high-z BHs with a mass of ~3.8x107 M☉ at z= 6.388 is inferred to be the 
progeny of a ~95M☉ seed formed at z~30 (#27, Table 2). Less massive seeds would end up growing 
into much smaller BHs, but no quasars of known masses in the range of 106-7 M☉ have thus far been 
detected at high redshifts except possibly for the one in CR7 (discussed hereunder). Sagittarius A*, 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the SMBH at the center of the Milky Way with a mass of ~4.3x106 M☉ [74] is within this mass range. 
If its seed also formed at z~30, and there is no reason to assume otherwise, then Eq. 4 and 5 predict 
that a ~30M☉ seed would have grown to Sagittarius A*’s current size by z ~9.28 or the cosmic age 
of ~524 Myr; and a ~100M☉ seed would have stopped growing by z~12 when the universe was only 
~364  Myr  old.  It  is  highly  unlikely  that  Sagittarius  A*  stopped  accreting  at  such  a  young  age, 
especially when Messier 61 (Table 3) with a mass (5x106M☉) comparable to that of Sagittarius A* is 
observed  to  be  actively  accreting  at  z~0.0052.  A  BH  could  stop  accreting  before  attaining  its 
maximum potential for lack of local supplies of gas. Stopping to accrete for this reason is, however, 
more likely at z near zero when the ambient gas density is orders of magnitude lower than at high z. 
Equation 6 predicts that Messier 61 with a seed mass of ~2.48M☉ (see Table 3) can potentially grow 
to a maximum size of ~5.46x106M☉ or slightly larger than its currently observed mass at z=0.0052. 
This comparison suggests that the seed of Sagittarius A* may have had a mass comparable or slightly 
smaller  than  that  of  Messier  61  and  that  it  may  have  ceased  to  actively  accrete  recently  having 
essentially attained its maximum potential via accretion. If so, Eq. 4 and 5 indicate that a 2M☉ seed 
formed  at  z=30  could  have  grown  to  the  size  of  Sagittarius  A*  by  z~0.035  or  ~500  Myr  ago. 
Irrespective  of  why  or  when  it  stopped  growing,  the  clear  implication  is  that  the  progenitor  of 
Sagittarius A* was apparently a stellar-mass remnant seed. 

Galaxy CR7 at z~6.6 is thought to harbor a SMBH that was initially interpreted to be a DCBH {75, 
76, 77]. This interpretation has been challenged [78, 79, 80]. Bowler et al. [78], however, concluded 
that it might be a low mass AGN. Assuming that CR7 harbors an AGN with a mass of 5-10x106 M☉ 
[81], we can apply Eq. 5 to ascertain the mass of its seed. Equation 5 indicates that the seed would 
have had a mass of ~18.9 + 6.2M☉ if it formed at z~30. The inferred seed mass is comparable to a 
seed of a POP III remnant rather than a DCBH. Hence, the empirical relations derived here do not 
support the possibility that the BH that might exist in CR7 is a DCBH. Instead, these relationships 
indicate that it probably grew from a stellar-mass remnant seed. 

5.3 Accretion versus merger  

The fact that the growth of all 59 quasars at z >5.7 and thousands at lower z can be accounted for via 
accretion indicates that merger of BHs apparently played an insignificant role in the growth of these 
BHs. This finding is largely in accord with the hydro dynamical simulations of Kulier et al. [82] who 
found that growth through accretion remains the predominant mode except possibly in the case of 
massive SMBHs at very low redshifts. Similarly, Pacucci and Loeb [50], who assumed in their growth 
models that BH seeds formed at z=30 consistent with the findings of this study, concluded that gas 
accretion is the primary growth mode for SMBHs at every cosmic epoch except for BH >109M☉ at z 
<1. Citing Power et al. [83], they suggested that this exception can be explained by the fact that at 
z<1 the amount of cold gas available for accretion starts to decline and may not be sufficient to fuel 
the most massive black holes. As the gas density decreases and a BH approaches its limit of growth 
via  accretion  near  z~0,  a  BH  can  only  grow  further  through  merger  with  other  BHs.  Hence,  it  is 
possible that at z~0 some of the SMBHs may exhibit growth through merger once the growth through 
accretion becomes insignificant. The results in Table 3, however, indicate that growth through merger 
even at z<1 is probably a rare occurrence. Since a BH nearly reaches its maximum growth potential 
via accretion at z~0, we may conclude that substantial growth of SMBHs in the future can only occur 
through their mergers.  

16 

 
 
5.4 Growth of black hole seeds 

We can infer the mass of an AGN at any z using Eq. 5 if its seed mass is known. Alternatively, we 
can estimate the mass MBH2 at z2 or time t2 of an AGN of a known mass MBH1 at z1 or t1 using the 
following equations derived from Eq.4 and 5. 

MBH2 ~ MBH1 exp 14.6 [(t2 - tS)/t2 - (t1- ts)/t1]                              

(6)  

MBH2 ~ MBH1 exp 14.6 [((1 + z1)/(1+ zS))3/2 - ((1 + z2 )/(1+ zS))3/2]       

(7)    

Note that we do not need the mass of the BH’s seed, but only the redshift  zs or time tS at which the 
seed may have formed in order to predict the increase in a BH’s mass from  z1 to z2 or time  t1 to t2, 
assuming the  BH  continues to  accrete, albeit  sporadically, during the specified time interval. The 
following observations and specific examples illustrate quantitatively the growth  of SMBHs from 
z=30 to z~0. The results in Table 2 show that a BH, irrespective of the size of its seed, grows by 5 to 
6 orders of magnitude in 600-900 Myr from its inception at z=30 to its observed mass at 7.64 > z > 
5.78. In comparison, Eq. 6 and 7 indicate that it grows by less than a factor of ~2.5 in the succeeding 
800 -1100 Myr until z~3.5, and by only a factor of ~2 in the next ~12Gyr from z =3.5 to z=0. Hence, 
about half of the growth apparently occurs in the first ~1.7Gyr of a BH’s life from z~30 to z~3.5 at 
an average growth rate of ~5.74x102M☉/Myr per unit (M☉) seed mass that translates into an upper 
limit of ~28.7M☉/yr for a seed of 5x104M☉. 

The foregoing empirical relationships were shown to be applicable at low redshifts down to z~0. It 
is, however, not evident that they may also be valid at z >>7.64, the highest z at which a SMBH has 
thus far been observed. Assuming that they are, we can examine the implications of the results of 
their  application  to  z  >>7.64.  We  can  use  Eq.  6  to  calculate  the  mass  accreted  by  a  BH  for  time 
intervals as short as 50 Myr and estimate the average mass-accretion rate ṀAGN for the corresponding 
period. For this purpose I applied Eq. 6 to an arbitrary seed mass starting at z=30 and calculated the 
average ṀAGN for successive 50-Myr intervals of cosmic time. The results are illustrated in Fig. 4 for 
a  typical  seed  mass  of  5.4x103M☉,  It  shows  that  ṀAGN  at  first  increases  exponentially,  reaches  a 
maximum and thereafter decreases slowly but steadily as z decreases. More precisely, Table 4 gives 
the results for ṀAGN in units of M☉/Myr per unit (solar) seed mass for the first 4 successive 50-Myr 
periods from z=30-13.8. It reaches a plateau of ~809M☉/Myr/unit seed mass during the cosmic time 
interval of 675-825 Myr or around z=7, after which it slowly decreases to ~ 763M☉/Myr near z=6 
and ~441M☉/Myr near z=3.5. The results suggest that there are two competing factors affecting the 
mass accretion rate: the increase in the gravitational reach of a BH as its mass increases with time 
and the decrease in the ambient gas density as z decreases. Apparently, initially a BH’s gravitational 
reach  increases  rapidly  such  that  the  volume  of  gas  available  for  accretion  increases  faster  than 
decrease in ambient gas density with z until the increase in volume and the decrease in gas density 
reach parity. Thereafter, the decrease in density exceeds the increase in gas volume per unit time and 
the mass of gas available for accretion decreases and hence the accretion rate decreases. The effect 
of these two competing factors apparently reaches parity near z=7.

MAGN in M☉/Myr per unit (M☉) BH seed mass; ER assuming ε=0.1; and ε assuming ER=1 

Furthermore, we can use the preceding mass-accretion rates ṀAGN to estimate ER or the radiative 
efficiency ε averaged over each of the 50-Myr periods. A BH’s luminosity LAGN = ε (1-ε)-1c2 ṀAGN, 
where c is the velocity of light and ε the radiative efficiency [see 59]; its Eddington luminosity LEdd 
~ 1.26x1038 ergs/s per unit (M☉) BH mass; and its ER = LAGN/LEdd. To obtain LEdd for each 50-Myr 
period, the BH mass is taken to be the average of its mass at the beginning and the end of the period. 
Note, however, that at  first a BH’s mass increases exponentially (Fig.4), and hence its Eddington 
luminosity calculated using the average of the BH’s mass at the beginning and end of a 50-Myr is 
prone to undefined uncertainties. Bearing in mind this caveat and assuming ε=0.1, we get the average 
ER shown in Table 4 for the first 4 successive 50-Myr periods. These results suggest that seeds may 
have  experienced  super-Eddington  accretion  for  the  first  ~150  Myr  of  their  life,  assuming 
ε=0.1.  Alternatively, assuming that accretion occurred at the Eddington limit, the average radiative 
efficiency ε may have been as low as ~0.053 in the first 50 Myr, that increased to ~ 0.062 in the next 
50 Myr, to  ~0.082  in  the third 50 Myr period, reaching ~0.11 in  the fourth 50-Myr period or the 
cosmic time from 250-300 Myr (see Table 4). And if accretion was sub-Eddington, then the values 
of ε would have to have been even lower than those at the Eddington limit. The result that ER may 
have exceeded unity for a short time at the beginning of a BH’s life, or that radiative efficiency may 
have  been  less  much  than  its  canonical  value  of  0.1  for  the  first  150  Myr,  is  consistent  with  the 
suggestion by Wyithe & Loeb [84] and Pacucci et al. [85] that super-Eddington accretion is possible 
when a BH is embedded in sufficiently dense gas that renders the radiation pressure less effective. 
As per the Standard model, the ambient gas density at z= 30-15 was higher by a factor of ~40-5.6 
than at say z=8

for a seed of 5.4x103M☉, inferred using Eq. 6. ṀAGN at first increases exponentially, reaches a plateau 
of ~4.3M☉/yr during the period of ~ 675-825 Myr (z ~7.64-6.55) around z=7, and steadily decreases 
thereafter. See Table 4 for ṀAGN/unit seed mass for the first 200 Myr from z=30-13.8. 

6. Conclusions 

The data for 59 SMBHs at z >5.7 ranging in mass over 2.5 orders of magnitude and ~300 Myr in 
age  show that 36 of them covering the entire age spectrum have markedly similar masses within a 
factor of ~2 of 2x103M☉ (Figs.1 and 2). Deconstructing Eq.1, it was concluded that this group of 36 
BHs  had  similar  size  seeds  that  formed  essentially  concurrently  and  that  the  accretion  ratio  AR 
defined by Eq.2 is AR= λ45/t, where λ is a constant and t is in Myr. Consequently, the variables (seed 
mass MS and its inception time tS) in Eq.1 defining the growth of each of the 36 BHs are reduced to 
constants and AR=λ45/t. The SANN method was used to simultaneously solve the 36 equations and 
subsets of them to determine the optimum model values of the 3 parameters MS, tS, and λ Using these 
model values, we got Eq. 3 defining AR as a function of age t, and Eq. 4 and 5 defining BH mass 
MBH as a function of age t or redshift z and seed mass MS. These relationships were extensively tested 
and applied to thousands of quasars at redshifts down to z~0. Notably, these empirical relationships 

19 

 
 
 
 
are  independent  of  all  models  of  formation  of  BHs  seeds  and  are  not  based  on  any  assumptions 
concerning the efficiency and duty cycle of luminous accretion or when the seeds might have formed. 

The results indicate that BH seeds formed at or near z=30 when the universe was~100 Myr old, and 
not much earlier or much later. The seed masses needed to account for the masses of SMBHs (>106M
☉) observed to date range from a few solar masses to ~5x104M☉. These lower and upper limits on 
the sizes of seeds are 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than those often attributed to POP III remnants 
and DCBHs thought  to  be the progenitors of SMBHs. A notable  conclusion is  that BHs  >109M☉ 
require seeds >103M☉, and hence their masses cannot be accounted for with seeds as small as 10M☉ 
as recently proposed by [20]. Apparently ~ half of a BH’s growth from its inception as a seed at z~30 
to  z~0  occurs  in  the  first  ~1700  Myr  of  a  quasar’s  life  span  until  z~3.5  at  an  average rate  of 
~5.74x102M☉/Myr per unit (M☉) seed mass, that translates into an upper limit of ~28.7M☉/yr for the 
seeds of the largest quasar’s observed to date. The other ~ half occurs in the succeeding ~12 Gyr until 
z~0. 

The maximum mass that a BH can accrete via accretion is deduced to be a function of the mass MS 
of its seed, amounting to ~2.2x106xMS. The implication is that the largest high-z SMBH observed to 
date could have potentially grown via accretion to a maximum size of (6.7+2)1010M☉, a result in 
excellent agreement with current observational data for low-z SMBHs and with theoretical physical 
limits proposed by King [61] and Inayoshi and Haiman [60]. The results also indicate that thus far 
accretion has been the predominant mode of SMBHs growth and suggest that substantial growth in 
the future can only occur through their mergers. 

Equations 6 and 7, derived from Eq. 4 and 5, provide estimates of BH growth from time t1 to t2 or 
from z1 to z2 knowing when the BH’s seed formed. Applying Eq. 6, we find that the rate of mass 
accretion apparently increased at first exponentially with time from the formation of the seeds near 
z=30,  reaching  a  maximum  near  z=7  in  the  time  period  of  675-825  Myr,  and  decreased  steadily 
thereafter (Fig.4). The average mass-accretion rate per unit (M☉) seed mass for the first 4 successive 
50-Myr  periods  from  z=30-13.8  are  shown  in  Table  4.  The  accretion  rate  apparently  reaches  a 
maximum of ~809M☉/Myr/unit seed mass near z=7 in the time period of 675-825 Myr. Thereafter, 
it slowly decreases to ~ 763M☉/Myr near z~6 and ~441M☉/Myr near z=3.5.  

The results imply that the seeds may have undergone a short period of super-Eddington accretion in 
the first ~150 Myr of their life, or that the radiative efficiency may have been significantly lower than 
the canonical value of 0.1 during the first 150 Myr.  The quantitative results for ER and ε for the first 
4 successive 50-Myr periods from z=30-13.8 are shown in Table 4. Assuming ε=0.1, it appears that 
the average Eddington ratio decreased from ~2 to ~0.91 in the fourth 50-Myr period. Alternatively, 
assuming  that  accretion  occurred  at  the  Eddington  limit,  the  radiative  efficiency  increased  from 
~0.053 in the first 50-Myr to ~0.11 in the fourth 50-Myr period.  Either inference is consistent with 
the  suggestion  by  Wyithe  &  Loeb  [84]  and  Pacucci  et  al.[85]  that  super-Eddington  accretion  is 
possible when a BH is embedded in sufficiently dense gas that renders the radiation pressure less 
effective. 

Lastly, the results suggest that  the progenitor of Sagittarius A* or the Milky Way’s central BH was 
probably  a  stellar-remnant  seed  with  a  mass  comparable  to  that  of  the  Sun  that  ceased  to  accrete 
recently having essentially attained its maximum growth potential through accretion. The results of 

20 

 
 
this study provide “observational” inputs for simulations and constraints for models of formation of 
BH seeds and their growth through cosmic times.
