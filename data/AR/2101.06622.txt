ABSTRACT
We study the formation of transient loops in the core of the AR 11890. For this
purpose, we have used the observations recorded by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). For photospheric ﬁeld
conﬁguration, we have used the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms obtained from the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). The transient is simultaneously observed in
all the UV and EUV channels of AIA and the three slit-jaw images from IRIS. The
co-existence of the transient in all AIA and IRIS SJI channels suggests the transient’s
multi-thermal nature. The transient consists of short loops located at the base of the
transient as well as longe loops. A diﬀerential emission measure (DEM) analysis shows
that the transient has a clumpy structure. The highest emission observed at the base
is within the temperature bin of log T = 6.65 − 6.95. We observe the longer loops at
a similar temperature, albeit very feeble. Using LOS magnetograms, we conclude that
the magnetic reconnection may have caused the transient. Our observations further
suggest that the physics of the formation of such transients may be similar to those of
typical coronal jets, albeit in diﬀerent topological conﬁgurations. Such multi-wavelength
observations shed light on the formation of hot plasma in the solar corona and provide
further essential constraints on modeling the thermodynamics of such transients.

1. INTRODUCTION

The existence of multi-million degree hot plasma in the solar corona has puzzled astronomers
since its discovery in the 1940s. In the last several decades, there has been a great advancement
in observational techniques and computation resources, which has led to tremendous progress in
understanding this issue. However, the ﬁnal solution remains elusive (Klimchuk 2006; Reale 2014).
In general terms, the on-disk corona is covered by three diﬀerent areas, viz. active regions, quiet
Sun, and coronal holes. Of which, active regions have higher temperature followed by the quiet Sun
and then coronal holes (see, e.g., Del Zanna & Mason 2018).

Active regions show pronounced heating in the observations taken so far with imaging and spectro-
scopic instruments. Therefore, they have been used as an excellent target of opportunity to address
solar coronal heating. The high resolution observation show that active regions are comprised of
loops observed at diﬀerent length scales (see e.g. Warren et al. 2008; Tripathi et al. 2009; Del Zanna
2013a; Reale 2014; Ghosh et al. 2017, and references/citations therein): such as fan loops (formed
at <1 MK), warm loops (formed at ∼1 MK) and hot core loops (∼3–5 MK). In addition, there is
signiﬁcant signiﬁcant amount of diﬀuse emission (Del Zanna & Mason 2003; Viall & Klimchuk 2011),
which has a peak emission at log T = 6.2 (Subramanian et al. 2014; Brooks 2019). Observations of
such loop structures along with the diﬀuse emission add further complication for the modeling.

With modern spectroscopic instruments observing in the spectral bands, which are sensitive to
solar coronal plasma, the fan loops and warm loop were resolved (Warren et al. 2008; Tripathi et al.
2009; Guarrasi et al. 2010; Ghosh et al. 2017, and references therein). Therefore, it has been possible
to directly measure plasma parameters such as electron density, temperature, ﬁlling factors in those
loops and compare with hydrodynamic modelling (see e.g. Del Zanna & Mason 2003; Warren et al.
2008; Tripathi et al. 2009; Gupta et al. 2015; Ghosh et al. 2017). Based on the observations from
spectroscopic and imaging instruments, it has been shown to a great extent that the properties of
warm and fan loops may be explained by low-frequency impulsive heating occurring in the corona.
However, in the core of the active region, structures are not well resolved, and therefore such
analysis is not possible. Thus, the formation of hot plasma in the active region’s core remains a
highly debatable topic. Due to the unresolved nature, the authors have relied on the measurements
such as Doppler shifts as well as Diﬀerential Emission Measures (DEM) (see, e.g., Tripathi et al.
2010, 2011; Warren et al. 2012a; Del Zanna et al. 2015) that did not require the structures to be
resolved.

With the high-resolution observations recorded by IRIS and AIA, it has now been possible to detect
individual transient events, including in the core of active regions (see, e.g. Testa et al. 2014, 2016;
Chitta et al. 2017, 2018). A detailed study of the formation and thermodynamics evolution of such
transients will help us comprehend the existence of the hot plasma in the core of active regions.

Testa et al. (2014, 2016) suggested that these transients in the core of active regions result from
coronal nanoﬂares with non-thermal electron beams. However, Chitta et al. (2017, 2018, 2020) suggest
that these events are due to the magnetic reconnection at the footpoints driven by photospheric
magnetic ﬂux cancellation occurring within the mixed polarity regions (Priest et al. 2018; Syntelis
et al. 2019). However, these studies did not focus on the thermodynamic evolution of these transients
(Gupta et al. 2018).

In this paper, we study the transient formation of hot loops in the core of an active region. For this
purpose, we have used the observations recorded with Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS;
De Pontieu et al. 2014), Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) and Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012). We perform the full thermodynamic study of the
transient loops by obtaining the diﬀerential emission measure. We also study the possible cause of
the transient occurrence by using the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms. The rest of the paper is

For this work, we have primarily used the observations recorded by IRIS and AIA. We have also
used the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms obtained from HMI to infer the underlying magnetic ﬁeld
structure. Both AIA and HMI are telescopes onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). All
three instruments simultaneously observed the active region AR 11890 and detected the transient
formation of a loop system within the core of the active region. We note that the transient loop
system studied here resembles the structure similar to those described by Hanaoka (1997) using
the observations recorded by the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT; Tsuneta et al. 1991) onboard Yohkoh.
These were referred to as “double loop conﬁguration of solar ﬂares”. We emphasize that Hanaoka
(1997), however, only studied the morphology of these structures and did not perform the study of
their thermodynamical evolution.

The background image shown in Fig. 1 displays a portion of the Sun’s disk covering the active
region recorded at the peak of the transient loops as observed in AIA 94 ˚A 1. The over-plotted pink
box covers the region we have selected from the full disk AIA observations for further study. The area
enclosed with the blue and white boxes locates the IRIS ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) in SJI and spectroscopic
mode. As is conspicuous, in SJI mode, IRIS covered the full extent of the feature. Unfortunately,
however, the transient loops were not observed in the spectroscopic mode. However, there is still
important information that warrants a detailed study using AIA and IRIS-SJI.

In SJI modes, IRIS observes the Sun in one near UV (NUV; 2796 ˚A) and two far-UV (FUV;
1330 ˚A, and 1400 ˚A) channels with a spatial resolution of 0.33 (cid:48)(cid:48). These three ﬁlters cover the solar
chromosphere and transition regions, respectively. For more details of the IRIS and its capabilities,
see De Pontieu et al. (2014).

The AIA, being the full disk imager, observed this event in all its ﬁlters with a pixel size of ∼0.6 (cid:48)(cid:48).
In the current study, for the purpose of dynamic evolution, we have used the observations recorded
in 1600 ˚A, 304 ˚A, 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A, 335 ˚A, 94 ˚A and 131 ˚A. Together, these ﬁlters cover a
temperature range of log T = 4.8 to log T = 20 MK. For more details on AIA and its capabilities
see Lemen et al. (2012) and information on the sensitivity of diﬀerent passbands to temperature
(O’Dwyer et al. 2010; Lemen et al. 2012; Boerner et al. 2012).

As demonstrated by O’Dwyer et al. (2010), the diﬀerent AIA channels have contributions from
plasma at diﬀerent temperatures. The three channels, namely 94 ˚A, 335 ˚A and 131 ˚A, which are
designed with a primary aim of studying the evolution of hot plasma, suﬀer from the fact that they
have contributions from plasmas at lower temperatures. A couple of empirical relations, giving similar
results, have been suggested (see Del Zanna 2013b; Warren et al. 2012b) to estimate and remove the
contribution of lower temperature plasma. In the present work, we have used the method proposed
by Del Zanna (2013b) to remove the cooler temperature emission from 94 ˚A channel and studied the
evolution of the transient in the Fe XVIII line.

To study the thermodynamic evolution of plasma within diﬀerent temperature bins simultaneously,
we have employed Diﬀerential Emission Measure (DEM) technique developed by Cheung et al.
(2015). The method developed by Cheung et al. (2015) is considerably faster than the other existing
codes (see also Hannah & Kontar 2012). Hence, this technique allows us to study the thermodynamic
evolution of the plasma in transient events. To derive the emission measure, we have used the original
level 1 AIA observations for all the six EUV channels and applied aia prep.pro.

1 94 ˚A image shown in the background is obtained after removing the contribution of cooler plasma.

3. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

3.1. Formation and evolution of the transient loops

In Fig. 2, we display a sequence of IRIS Si IV images, showing the full evolutionary sequence
(i.e., the formation, evolution, and eventual disappearance) within a duration of ∼ 15 minutes of the
transient loops in the core of the active region. We observe the ﬁrst brightening at the location marked
with the arrow shown in Fig. 2.B. In the next frame, recorded after about 4 minutes, we observe
two localized brightenings along with an inverted and slanted Y-shaped structure. This structure
connects the two localized brightenings and extends further towards the west. Simultaneously, we
observe another localized brightening towards further west, enclosed by a box in Fig. 2.C, which
evolves in subsequent images. The transient structure attains its maximum brightness after about
8 minutes from the onset (see Fig. 2.D) and disappears completely in panel E, with the footpoint
localized brightening still prevalent. At the peak of the transient, another simultaneous brightening
is observed at [40, -180], shown by asterisks in Figs. 2.C and D.

To study the cooler counterpart of the transient, in Fig. 3 we display the observations recorded by
IRIS in Mg II & C II (panels A & C) and those recorded by AIA in 304 ˚A & 1600 ˚A (panels B & D).
These images are taken at the peak of the transient. Note the larger FOV of AIA images compared
to that of IRIS images. We selected the bigger FOV of AIA images to obtain a more comprehensive
view of the transient. The inverted and slanted Y-shaped structure of the transient, including the
footpoint brightening, is well observed in all the channels. Moreover, associated with the transient,
the 304 ˚A channel image reveals the presence of a twisted ﬁlament. The ﬁlament is not observed in
Mg II and C II due to smaller FOV, albeit the western footpoint. The isolated localised brightening
enclosed by the box in Fig. 2.B) is also seen in Mg II as well as C II. However, no such brightening
is observed in 304 ˚A and 1700 ˚A images. The brightening located with asterisks at [40, -180] in
Figs. 2.C and D is also conspicuously seen in Fig. 3.C and D. We note that this brightening is located
at the western footpoint of the associated ﬁlament (marked with an arrow). The 304 ˚A image and
the corresponding animation (Figure3D animation.mp4) demonstrate that the transient started at
the eastern footpoint of the ﬁlament. We observe mass motion, i.e., movement of brightenings in
both directions along the ﬁlament axis. We further note the brightenings of some strands winding
around the ﬁlament.

The corresponding coronal images recorded at the peak of the evolution are shown in Fig. 4. We
note that the transient is well observed in all the AIA channels, particularly the transient base. The
ﬁlament structure observed in 304 image is also visible in 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, 211 ˚A as well as 131 ˚A
(mostly due to the contribution of Fe VIII line). The 335 and 94 ˚A images suggest that the base of
the transient comprises multiple loops; only some are seen in lower temperature ﬁlters. The 94 ˚A
images show the transient in its complete virtue. The base of the transient comprises multiple loops
that are crisscrossing and a long loop that is connecting the base of the transient to the western
footpoint of the ﬁlament.

To get a better understanding of the hot loops in the transient, we have employed the method of Del
Zanna (2013b) on 94 ˚A images taken by AIA to obtain Fe XVIII emission. Fig. 5 and correspond-
ing animation (Figure5 animation.mp4) displays a sequence of thus obtained images representing
Fe XVIII emission with peak formation temperature of log T [K] = 6.85. Note that we have displayed
these images in negative intensities. Fig. 5 shows that the transient base consists of loops connecting

Transient loops in the core of an active Region

the two footpoints (see also the corresponding animation). The two footpoints brighten up nearly
simultaneously (see frame number 15 in Figure5 animation.mp4).

With passing time, a few more loops appear.

In frame number 40 onwards, we identify a long
loop-like structure (see Fig. 5.A) that connects the western foot point. The loop evolves with time,
and the width increases, suggesting it to be a multi-stranded structure. We also note a kink at
[-40,-200], located with an arrow in Fig. 5.E. The presence of the kink suggests that there are loops
connecting the kink location with the transient western footpoint and the base. Finally, the complete
structure fades aways. The total time of evolution of the transient is 15 mins. The images displayed
in Fig. 5 also demonstrate that the transient is multi-stranded and diﬀerent strands are lighting up
at diﬀerent times in the course of the evolution.

3.2. DEM inversion and temperature evolution

To study the temperature structure of the transient, we have performed emission measure (EM)
analysis using the six coronal channels of AIA. For this purpose, we have employed the EM code
developed by Cheung et al. (2015). The EM is computed for each pixel. Note that to derive the EM,
we have used original level 1.5 data from all the channels including 94 ˚A.

In Fig. 6 (see also the corresponding animation Figure6 animation.mp4), we plot the EM-maps
obtained in diﬀerent temperature bins as labeled at the peak of the transient (corresponding to the
AIA images shown in Fig. 4). The EM maps demonstrate the clumpy nature of the transient, both at
the base as well as along the loop-like structure connecting the western footpoint. At the peak phase,
the base of the transient is brightest in the EM map obtained for log T = [6.35 − 6.95] (Figs. 6.C
& D). However, in this temperature range, there is almost no emission from the western side of the
transient. The EM maps further suggest that the base and lower half of the transient are multi-
thermal in nature. We further note that the base, as well as the long loop-like structure, are thinner
at higher temperatures, suggesting that only a few strands are at higher temperatures. The long
loop structure is clearly and completely seen in the EM-maps corresponding to temperature bins of
log T = [6.95−7.25] and log T = [7.25−7.55] (see Figs. 6.E & F). This EM maps suggest that the long
loop structure also seen in Fe XVIII images (see Fig. 5.D) might be as high as log T = [7.25 − 7.55].
However, we note that the emission measure for the long loop in this temperature range is very low.
To obtain the quantitative temperature structure of the transient, we plot the EM curves obtained
at seven diﬀerent locations [P0, P1... P6], as shown in Fig. 7. The plots are obtained at three
diﬀerent instances during the evolution of the transient. The blue curves show the EM during the
early phase, whereas the orange and red curves are at the peak and towards the end of the transient.
The plots show that at the peak of the transient, there is a signiﬁcant enhancement in EM. The
EM curves for P0, P1, and P2 peaks at around log T = 6.5, which is usually seen for the core of
active regions (see, e.g. Tripathi et al. 2011; Del Zanna 2013a). For the rest of the locations, at the
maximum phase of the transient, the peaks of the EM curves shift towards higher temperatures. For
locations P3 and P4, the EM curves have long tails towards the higher temperature, suggesting that
it contains plasma at much higher temperatures.

It is important to note that although the long loop structure is observed, albeit very faint, in the
EM map corresponding to the temperature bin of log T = 7.25 − 7.55 (Fig. 6.F), it is not reﬂected
in the EM curves shown in Fig. 7. This could be because of not well constrained EM curves towards
the higher temperatures (see, e.g., Winebarger et al. 2012). It is also important to emphasize that
the EM maps obtained at high temperatures, in particular in the bins of log T = 6.95 − 7.25 and

6

Durgesh Tripathi

log T = 6.25 − 7.55, are very likely erroneous, as was suggested by Young & Muglach (2014) and
may be due unaccounted cooler lines present within the passbands of 94 ˚A and 131 ˚A. Therefore,
caution must be exercised while interpreting such EM maps obtained at higher temperatures.

3.3. Evolution of the Photospheric Magnetic ﬁeld at the base of the transient

In order to study the origin of the transient, we combine the AIA observations with the LOS of
magnetograms recorded with HMI. Fig. 8.A shows an HMI LOS magnetogram in the background and
AIA 94 ˚A image in the foreground, both taken nearly simultaneously at the peak of the transient. In
Fig. 8.B, we have over-plotted contours (±100 G) of magnetic ﬂux density on AIA 94 ˚A image. The
ﬁgure clearly shows that the two footpoints of the transient base are rooted in two diﬀerent polarity
regions. The long loop-like structure connects to the other major polarity of the active region.

To study the time evolution of the source region magnetic ﬁeld, we have also plotted a sequence of
HMI LOS magnetograms in Fig. 9. These are the closest in time for the AIA 94˚A images shown in
Fig. 5. The two footpoints of the transient base are located by two arrows in the top left panel. As
can be readily seen, the base location has an abundance of mixed polarities. The ﬁrst brightenings,
which are also the footpoints of the base of the transient, seen in Si IV images shown in Fig. 2 occur
at these locations. Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that those brightenings and the eventual
transient occurred due to heating caused by the magnetic reconnection. However, we note that in 19
mins for which LOS magnetograms are displayed, we do not observe any signiﬁcant change.

We have also studied the longer-term evolution of magnetic ﬂux. For this purpose, we have obtained
HMI magnetograms starting from 18:00 UT (almost three hours before the trigger of the transient).
These images are shown in Figure9 animation.mp4, which demonstrates changes in the magnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration in the footpoint region. To quantify any change, if at all, in the photospheric
magnetic ﬂux at the footpoint regions, we study the evolution of magnetic ﬂux starting three hours
before the launch of the transient. For this purpose, we chose a small region located at the right
footpoint of the base, as shown in the bottom right panel of Fig. 9. In Fig. 10, we plot the evolution
of total signed ﬂux (blue), total positive ﬂux (orange), and total negative ﬂux (red). We note that
for the ﬁrst one hour, both the positive ﬂux and negative ﬂux decreased, which is also reﬂected in
the decrease in the total signed ﬂux. Beyond 19:00 UT, positive ﬂux remains almost constant, and
negative ﬂux continues to decrease until the transient trigger, also reﬂected in the total signed ﬂux.
Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that such a change in the ﬁeld conﬁguration may have been
central to the trigger of the transient. However, it is important to note that the box over which the
ﬂux is computed may not be representative. Moreover, the question remains: should it really take
three hours of continuous change in the photospheric ﬂux to create such transients in the corona.

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we present a multi-wavelength study of the formation of a transient event in the
core of an active region. For this purpose, we have used slit-jaw images from IRIS and all the EUV
and 1600 ˚A images of AIA. To probe the transient’s thermodynamic nature, we have employed the
DEM technique on the EUV observations of AIA taken in 6 coronal channels. To shed light on the
transient’s possible origin, we have also studied the LOS magnetograms obtained by HMI.

The transient is observed in the slit-jaw images of Mg II, C II and Si IV recorded using IRIS as
well as in the UV and EUV channels of AIA. The two footpoints of the transient brightens-up nearly
simultaneously, as is noted from SJI’s recorded in Si IV. Such simultaneous brightenings at both the

Transient loops in the core of an active Region

7

footpoints have also been observed by, e.g., Testa et al. (2014); Chitta et al. (2017); Gupta et al.
(2018).

The complete structure of the transient is best observed in the 94 ˚A images of the AIA (see Figs. 4
& 5). The transient comprises short loops located at the base and longer loops connecting the
other main polarity of the active region. Transient events with a similar morphology have been
reported earlier by Hanaoka (1997) and have been referred to as “double loop conﬁguration of solar
ﬂares.” The AIA 304 ˚A images also reveals the presence of a twisted ﬁlament (panel D of Fig 3). By
combining the observations recorded in cool channels such as 304 ˚A (see the corresponding animation
Figure3D animation.mp4) with those in 193 or 94 ˚A images, we ﬁnd that the transient brightening
appears in diﬀerent strands. Observations also reveal that these strands are winding around the
ﬁlament. Moreover, the transient event is highly ﬁlamentary (see Figs. 5 and 6), which is suggestive
of multi-stranded structure. The highest emission is observed at the base of the transient within the
temperature bin of log T = 6.65 − 6.95 (see panel D of Fig. 6), whereas the long loop-like structure
is best seen, albeit very faint, in higher temperature log T = 6.95 − 7.55 (panels E & F of Fig. 6).
However, we note that such emission in high temperatures should be interpreted with caution due to
limited constraints at higher temperatures (e.g. Winebarger et al. 2012). Moreover, the structures
observed in the EM maps obtained at such high temperatures may also be due to the presence of
unaccounted cooler lines in the passbands of 94 ˚A and 131 ˚A passbands as was suggested by Young
& Muglach (2014).

Combining the AIA observations with those from HMI line-of-sight magnetograms, we ﬁnd that
the base of the transient is rooted in primary negative polarity and the parasitic positive polarity,
whereas the long loop connects to the main positive polarity of the active region (see Fig. 8). The
evolution study of the photospheric LOS magnetic ﬁeld throughout the existence of the transient,
i.e., for 19 mins, did not show any noticeable change in the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld at the
base of the transient (see Fig. 9). However, over a long time scale, we observed noticeable changes in
the ﬁeld conﬁguration (see Figure9 animation.mp4) as well as a change in the total signed ﬂux over
a small boxed region located at the base of the transient. Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that
changes in the magnetic ﬂux may have resulted in the transient. However, the data do now allow a
conclusive determination of whether ﬂux changes caused the observed transient.

Motivated by the observations, we provide a schematic diagram in Fig. 11, which is similar to
that of Hanaoka (1997) and depicts the evolution of the transient studied here. We envision that
there are small loops structures rooted within the main polarity forming between P4 and P5. These
loops are due to the presence of parasitic polarities. There are also other loop systems connecting
the two main polarities from P0 to P5. In Fig. 11, we show these loops in blue. Our observations
suggest that reconnection occurs between the blue loops, leading to loops forming with green color.
The loops coming out from the reconnection region will have a kink, which is also supported by the
observational results of the presence of the kink in Fig. 4 marked with an arrow. Moreover, the EM
curves suggest a substantial enhancement in temperature at the kink location (see Fig. 7, P3).

It is important to note that the physics of the formation of these transients may be similar to those
of jets in diﬀerent topological scenarios (see Raouaﬁ et al. 2016, for a review on jets). In the typical
coronal jet scenario, the reconnection occurs among closed ﬁeld lines and open ﬁeld lines giving rise
to a collimated structure. However, the observation reported here suggests reconnection between two
closed ﬁeld lines that leads to the formation of a longer loop, which is analogous to the spire of typical

8

coronal jets, similar to those observed in the simulations of Gontikakis et al. (2009); Archontis et al.
(2010). Moreover, the properties such as lifetime (15 min), multi-thermal nature, and DEM at the
base of the transient observed here are similar to those obtained for jets observed at the periphery of
active regions (see, e.g., Mulay et al. 2016; Raouaﬁ et al. 2016). We further note that the presence
of ﬁlament at the base of the transients is also similar to jet events reported by many authors (see,
e.g. Hong et al. 2011; Sterling et al. 2015; Hong et al. 2016; Panesar et al. 2017; Kumar et al. 2018,
and references therein).

Although we have qualitatively described the formation of the transient reported here, further
observational work, primarily with spectroscopic measurements combined with modeling, is necessary
for a complete understanding of the physics of such transients within the core of active regions. Such
studies will help comprehend the formation of hot plasma in the core of active regions.

Figure 1. The transient at its peak phase as observed in Fe XVIII line deduced from AIA 94 ˚A. The pink
over-plotted box represents the AIA ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) that is considered for further analysis. The blue
and white boxes locate the IRIS SJI and spectroscopic FOV.

Figure 2. Evolution of the transient as observed in IRIS 1400 ˚A SJI. The arrows in panels B, C and D
marks the ﬁrst sign of activity, the three intense brightenings and the transient structure, respectively. The
box in panel C locates another brightening that also occurs simultaneous to those marked by arrows.

Figure 3. The transient at the peak of its evolution as observed with IRIS Mg II and C II SJI (panels A
and C) and AIA 1600 and 304 ˚A passbands (panels C and D). An animated version of panel D is available
in the HTML version of the article, showing the evolution of the transient for about 18 mins as observed in
304 ˚A and the presence of an associated ﬁlament. Mass motions in both directions along the ﬁlament axis
are seen. The animation also shows the brightenings of some strands winding around the ﬁlament.

Figure 4. Same as Fig. 3 but for coronal channels of AIA as labelled.

Figure 5. Evolution of the transient as observed in Fe XVIII line deduced from 94 ˚A channel of AIA.
An animated version of this ﬁgure is available in the HTML version of the article, which demonstrates
the evolution of the transient for 18 min as observed in Fe XVIII line deduced from 94 ˚A. The animations
demonstrate the multi-stranded nature of the transient, with loops at diﬀerent length scales. During the
early phase of the evolution, loops at the base are seen. However, after about 8 mins, a longer loop structure
connecting to the western footpoint is observed.

Figure 6. Emission measure maps at the peak time of evolution of the transient in diﬀerent temperature
bins as labelled. See also the corresponding animation. The unit for color bar in each panel are [×1026] cm−5.
An animated version of this ﬁgure is available in the HTML version of the article, showing the evolution of
EM in each temperature bin for 18 mins. The animation clearly shows the clumps in the transient structure
and it multi-stranded nature. The highest emission measure is seen at the base in EM maps corresponding
to the temperature of log T = 6.65 − 6.95.

Figure 9. Sequence of HMI LOS magnetograms showing the evolution of magnetic ﬂux density in the source
regions. The arrows locate the regions where the base of the transient is located. The box the bottom right
panel shows the region which we considered for quantitative study of the evolution of magnetic ﬂux with
time. The magnetic ﬁeld maps are displayed in the range of ±100G. An animated version of this ﬁgure is
available in the HTML version of the article, demonstrating the evolution of the LOS photospheric magnetic
ﬂux at the base of the transient, starting three hours before the transient’s onset. Over a period of three
hours, there is a substantial change in the photospheric magnetic ﬂux at the base. Note that to enhance the
small-scale ﬂux, the maps are displayed between ±40 G.

Figure 11. Schematic representation of the transient. The points P0, P3, P4 and P5 represent the
corresponding locations shown in the top left panel of Fig. 7. The encircled cross marks the possible location
of reconnection between the loops connecting P0 – P5 and P4 – P5, shown in blue. The green lines represent
the reconnected ﬁeld lines. Location P3 depicts the kinked ﬁeld lines, also observed in Fig. 4.
