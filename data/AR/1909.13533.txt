Large book–cycle Ramsey numbers

Abstract

Let B(k)

n be the book graph which consists of n copies of Kk+1 all sharing a common
Kk, and let Cm be a cycle of length m. In this paper, we ﬁrst determine the exact value
of r(B(2)
1000. This answers a question of
Faudree, Rousseau and Sheehan (Cycle–book Ramsey numbers, Ars Combin., 31 (1991),
239–248) in a stronger form when m and n are large. Building upon this exact result, we
are able to determine the asymptotic value of r(B(k)

n , Cn) for each k
that for each k
n , Cn) = (k + 1 + ok(1))n. This extends a result due to Rousseau
and Sheehan (A class of Ramsey problems involving trees, J. London Math. Soc., 18 (1978),
392–396).

1 Introduction

For graphs H1 and H2, the Ramsey number r(H1, H2) is the minimum integer N such that
every red-blue edge coloring of the complete graph KN contains either a red H1 or a blue H2.
Let B(k)
n be the book graph which consists of n copies of Kk+1 all sharing a common Kk. When
k = 2, we write Bn instead of B(2)
n for convenience. Book Ramsey numbers have attracted a lot
of attention, see [12, 25, 29, 22, 23, 24] and other related references. In particular, answering
a question of Erd˝os et al.
[12], Conlon [8] established an asymptotic version of Thomason’s
conjecture [29] by showing

Let Cm and Tm be a cycle and a tree of order m, respectively. The Ramsey numbers of
book versus tree and book versus cycle also received a great deal of attention. Strengthening a
classical result due to Chv´atal [7], Rousseau and Sheehan [26] established that

r(B(k)

For more book-tree Ramsey numbers, see e.g. [26, 13, 6, 16]. A natural question is whether we
can prove a similar result for book-cycle Ramsey number when they have nearly equal order.

The study of book-cycle Ramsey numbers goes back to [25] by Rousseau and Sheehan. In
particular, they proved r(Bn, C3) = 2n+3 for n > 1. In [15, 17], Faudree, Rousseau and Sheehan
proved some results for r(Bn, C4), and generally,

r(Bn, Cm) =

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will collect several results
which will be used to prove our results. In Section 3, we will present proofs of Theorem 1 and
Theorem 2.

2 Preliminaries

In this section, we collect a number of previous results which are needed for our proofs.
Crucial tools include a reﬁned version of Szemer´edi’s regularity lemma and the (weakly) pancyclic
properties of graphs.

2.1 Regularity method

Szemer´edi’s regularity lemma [28] is a powerful tool in extremal graph theory. The regularity
lemma is also called the uniformity lemma, see e.g., Bollob´as [3] and Gowers [18]. Applications of
the regularity method are fruitful. We refer the reader to the survey of Koml´os and Simonovits
[19] and other related references.

A key tool in the proof of Theorem 2 is a reﬁned version of the Szemer´edi’s regularity lemma

by Conlon [8]. We state it and its related results as following.

Let G be a graph deﬁned on vertex set V = V (G). For X, Y

We need the following reﬁned version of the regularity lemma by Conlon [8, Lemma 3]. In

2.2 Pancyclic properties of graphs

For a graph G, we use g(G) and c(G) to denote its girth and circumference, i.e., the length
of a shortest cycle and a longest cycle of G. Similarly, the odd girth of G is the length of a
shortest odd cycle in G. A graph is called weakly pancyclic if it contains cycles of every length
between its girth and its circumference. A graph is pancyclic if it is weakly pancyclic with girth
3 and circumference n =
. We say a graph is 2-connected if it remains connected after
V (G)
|
|
the deletion of any vertex.

For a graph G, let δ(G) denote the minimum degree of G. The following classical result is

due to Dirac [10].

Lemma 6 Let G be a 2-connected graph of order n with minimum degree δ = δ(G). Then
c(G)

Dirac’s result tells us that the circumference of a 2-connected graph cannot be too small. In
n/2, then c(G) = n. This is a well-known result for a graph being
n/2, the following result due to Bondy [4] tells us more

The following is an elegant extension on graphs being weakly pancyclic by Brandt, Faudree
and Goddard [5], which is a key ingredient in the proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 for k = 3.

Lemma 8 Let G be a 2-connected nonbipartite graph of order n with δ(G)
n/4 + 250. Then
G is weakly pancyclic unless G has odd girth 7, in which case it has every cycle from 4 up to its
circumference except the 5-cycle.

3 Proofs of Theorems 1 and 2

In this section, we will give proofs for our main results. Throughout the proof, when con-
sidering a red-blue edge coloring of KN , we always use R and B to denote subgraphs formed
by red and blue edges, respectively. We also suppose that n
1000 for Theorem 1 and n is
suﬃciently large for Theorem 2.

≥

3.1 Proof of Theorem 1

We ﬁrst give the following simple fact.

Fact 4 Let G be a graph which consists of three connected components V1, V2 and V3.

(i) If the largest connected component has at least n vertices, then the complement G contains

a Bn.

(ii) If one of sets V1, V2 and V3 contains a non-edge while the other two sets have at least n

vertices in total, then the complement G contains a Bn.

Remark 2: For k = 2, the inequality (8) indeed holds and there is no contradiction. Thus we
are not able to prove r(B(3)
n , Cn) = (4 + o(1))n by induction and we provide a separated proof
for this case.
