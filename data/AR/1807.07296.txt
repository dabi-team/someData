Anisotropic nanostructured porous Pd films are fabricated using oblique angle deposition in vacuum on a glass substrate. 

They display a dichroic response, due to localised surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) within the nanoparticles forming the 

film,  dependent  on  the  incident  light  polarisation.  Ultrasensitive  hydrogen  sensing  is  reached  by  using  these  films  in 

conjunction with a differential optical technique derived from the reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy. The evolution of the 

samples’ optical responses is monitored  during  the formation of  Pd hydride  in  both the dilute  a

-phase and  the dense b -

phase,  whilst  the  samples  are  exposed  to  different  concentration  of  H2  in  Ar  (from  100%  H2  to  a  few  ppm).  The 

measurements are performed at a single wavelength in the visible range and at 22°C. The results show that a quantitative 

measurement  of  the  hydrogen  concentration  in  a  carrier  gas  can  be  measured  throughout  the  concentration  range.  The 

limit  of  detection  is  10  ppm  and  the  time  for  detecting  the  presence  of  H2  in  the  carrying  gas  is  below  one  second  at 

concentration  down  to  0.25%  of  H2  in  Ar.  Furthermore,  the  optical  anisotropy  of  the  samples  and  its  evolution  with 

exposure to H2 are correctly reproduced with an effective medium theory.

1. Introduction 

The  development  of  hydrogen  technology  is  today  one  of  the  main  path  to  the  production  of  clean  and 

renewable energy [1–4]. However, the use of dihydrogen rises concerns from its explosive properties in air. 4% 

of  H2  is  indeed  the  flammable  mixture  and  thus  efforts  are  made  to  develop  selective,  sensitive  and  fast 

responding  dihydrogen  detectors  [5,6].  Several  paths  are  being  investigated  to  reach  this  goal  [7–11]  in 

particular with sensors based on Pd, as it selectively reduces when exposed to H2 to form palladium hydrides 

[12]. In recent years, attempts have been made to develop plasmonic sensors, using localised surface plasmon 

resonances (LSPR) excited by light in metal-Pd or pure Pd nanoparticles (NPs), based on the change in optical 

response  of  Pd  when  forming  hydrides  [13].  In  addition  to  the  good  sensitivity  and  fast  response  of  such 

plasmonic sensors, the use of light as a probe implies that the sample is a passive component of the system, 

which eliminates hazards such as electrical sparks associated with electronic setups. 

 
 
 
 
 
Most LSPR-based sensors [14–20] are made of Au NPs which exhibit a well-defined plasmonic resonance. Au 

NPs having weak interaction with H2 [21], hybrid systems such as core-shell Au-Pd NPs [22,23], AuPd alloy NPs 

[20], Au NPs - Pd NPs oligomers [24,25] have been used. In these systems, the hydrogenation of Pd modifies 

the dielectric environment of the Au NPs, hence induces a shift in wavelength of the LSPR of Au, which gives a 

measurement of the presence of H2 [13].  Recently, K. Sugawa et al. have shown Pd to be the “third plasmonic 

sensing material”. Indeed, LSPR in the visible range has been obtained by using large Pd spheres (diameters of 

100 to 200 nm), displaying a dependency to the embedding medium’s refractive index change, demonstrating 

the  ability  of  Pd  particles  for  plasmonic  sensing  [26].  It  has  also  been  shown  that  flat  Pd  nanodisks  and 

nanorings of sizes around 300 nm, prepared by colloidal lithography, display LSPR in the near infra-red, which is 

red-shifted upon exposure to H2, due to the formation of Pd hydride [27].  

Despite  this  sensitivity  to  H2¸  the  thermodynamics  of  Pd  hydride  does  impose  an  important  limitation  for 

hydrogen sensing applications. Indeed, the phase diagram of Pd hydride exhibits different phases depending on 

the partial pressure of H2, p(H2). At room temperature, in the case of bulk Pd, the dense phase, PdHx with x ≥ 
0.6,  known  as  the  b -phase,  is  obtained  for  p(H2)  larger  than  about  10-2  bar,  i.e.  more  than  about  1%  H2  in 
ambient gas at atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, at p(H2) ≲10-3 bar, only the low density α-phase is 
reached,  with  a  maximum  value  x  »

  0.02  [28].  At  intermediate  pressure,  a  hybrid  α  +  b

  phase  is  formed, 

constituted by b -phase regions embedded in the α-phase [29]. Regarding sensing applications, concentrations 

much  lower  than  the  flammability  limit  of  4%  have  to  be  detected,  and  it  is  therefore  mandatory  that  H2 

sensors be sensitive to the very initial α-phase formation [13]. This leads to an important issue for plasmonic 

sensors, as only the optical response of the dense b -phase strongly differs from that of pure Pd [30], whereas 

the optical response of the α-phase is very close to Pd. Consequently, shifts in the LSPR position large enough 

to  be  easily  observed  with  conventional  plasmonic  sensors  are  reached  only  when  the b -phase  or  the  α  + b
phase are obtained, i.e. for p(H2) larger than about 10-3 to 10-2 bar at room temperature. 

In the range of interest p(H2) ≤ 10-3 bar, the α-phase leads to sub-nanometre shifts of  the LSPR, which are 

difficult to measure with conventional plasmonic sensors. Indeed, the shift is usually determined by performing 

spectroscopic measurements around the resonance, followed by a fitting of the obtained spectra. Clearly, such 

a  method  is  limited  by  the  resolution  and  the  reproducibility  of  the  spectrometers  which  are,  for  current 

monochromators,  depending  on  the  width  of  the  monochromator’s  slits,  between  0.1  nm  and  a  few  nm. 

Improved resolution as low as 0.01 nm, necessary for detecting the α-phase, could be reached by using high-

resolution  monochromators  with  micrometre  slit,  though  these  apparatus  are  bulky  and  expensive,  thus  not 

suitable for simple, low-cost and easy-to-use sensors. 

In  order  to  answer  these  issues  and  to  increase  the  sensitivity  of  plasmonic  sensors,  several  authors 

developed  specific  Au/Pd  or  Pd  nanostructures.  For  example,  studies  conducted  by  Langhammer’s  group 

showed a good sensitivity and reproducibility at 2% and 4% of H2 in Ar as carrying gas for Pd NPs and Au-Pd 

heterodimers placed in a flow reactor  [31,24]. Yang et al. reported a detection limit down to 2% H2 in N2 by 

using Au-Pd dimers and trimers  [25]. With a “Pd-based plasmonic perfect absorber”, Tittl et al.  were able to 

2 

 
 
detect  concentration down to 0.5% [32]. Jiang et al obtained a detection limit as low as 0.2% for H2 in N2 with 

bimetallic Au/Pd nanorods [23]. Langhammer et al. [33] and Wadell et al. [20], indeed presented results with 

detection  limit  down  to  0.1  %  of  H2,  but  the  experiments  were  performed  in  a  vacuum  chamber  and  not  at 

atmospheric pressure. To our knowledge, no LSPR-based system showed detection limit for partial pressures of 

H2 in a carrying gas far below 1%, i.e. in the range of early formation of the a

-phase, at or below 0.1%. Such 

sensitivity is desirable, for safety consideration but also for analysis of impurities in several industrial processes 

[6], as it has been brought forward by Wadell et al. [13]. 

In  the  present  investigation,  we  address  the  sensitivity  issue  due  to  the  resolution  limitation  of  the 

monochromator,  by  using  the  Transmittance  Anisotropy  Spectroscopy  (TAS),  derived  from  the  Reflectance 

Anisotropy  Spectroscopy,  which  has  been  shown  to  be  a  very  efficient  and  sensitive  optical  technique  for 

investigating  pristine  or  adsorbate-covered  crystalline  surfaces  [34–38]  and  for  supported  metal  NPs  [21,39–

41]. This method being differential, any kind of instability is eliminated, should it be due to the fluctuation in 

the light source or to mechanical noise. There is also no interference with ambient light and it can be used in 

illuminated environment. This technique leads to very stable and very sensitive measurements, which are not 

reachable  with  conventional  plasmonic  methods.  Additionally,  this  apparatus  is  operated  at  a  single 

wavelength and does not require spectroscopic measurements, which therefore frees oneself from the use of a 

monochromator  and  strongly  lightens  the  operating  system.  Such  an  approach  has  been  previously  followed 

with  anisotropic  Au  NPs  dimers  for  the  detection  of    biomolecules  [42].  Similarly,  by  use  of  polarisation-

dependent Au-Pd heterodimers, Wadell et al. have increased their sensitivity to H2 detection and suppress drift 

issues [24]. However, in these examples, the NPs were prepared by lithographic methods, and  the large size of 

the  NPs  reduced  the  overall  detection  limit  to  H2  exposure.  It  has  been  shown  indeed  that  the  smaller  the 

nanoparticles,  the  greater  the  surface-to-volume  ratio,  and  the  higher  the  sensitivity  and  the  shorter  the 

response time [13,43,44].  

Consequently,  efforts  are  to  be  made  to  develop  smaller  but  anisotropic  NPs,  in  order  to  exhibit  fast 

response to hydrogen and be investigated by the TAS technique. We address this second issue by elaborating 

pure Pd films, grown by oblique angle deposition, as already proposed for other metals [45,46]. This method 

provides  anisotropic  nanostructured  films  formed  by  NPs  a  few  nm  large,  where  the  LSPR  excited  by  the 

impinging light strongly depends on the polarisation of light, leading to dichroic properties suitable for TAS. We 

demonstrate  that  this  yields  a  sensitivity  to  amounts  of  H2  diluted  in  Ar  as  small  as  a  few  ppm  at  room 

temperature,  and  also  a  fast  response  in  the  range  of  seconds.  Moreover,  it  also  grants  us  the  ability  to 

determine the precise amount of small fractions of H2 diluted in Pd, showing the quantitative potentiality of 

this  technique.  Experiments  were  also  undertaken  in  dry  and  humid  air  (50%  humidity)  to  determine 

perspectives in terms of selectivity and reactivity of the system in realistic conditions. 

2. Experimental details 

3 

 
The  elaboration  of  the  anisotropic  Pd  films  is  done  using  oblique  angle  deposition  under  a  3.10-6  mbar 

vacuum on glass substrates, prepared from microscope slides cleaned with ethanol. The evaporation is carried 

out from a crucible heated by direct current with the samples positioned at a grazing angle of about 10° to the 

crucible  and  the  evaporation  rate  was  0.2  nm/s.  The  mass  thickness  is  controlled  using  a  calibrated  quartz 

balance and corrected to account for the evaporation angle. The characterisations of the samples are carried 

out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical measurements. The SEM apparatus used is a Zeiss Supra 

40. The settings are EHT = 5 kV at a working distance of 2.8 mm with an aperture of 7 µm. The SEM needs to be 

adjusted with a low potential, as the substrate being nonconductive, the samples are prone to charging. The 

optical  absorbance  was  measured  on  a  Agilent  Cary  5000  UV-Vis-NIR  spectrometer.  Both  parallel  and 

perpendicular polarisations in relation to the sample’s direction of evaporation are recorded. The anisotropic 

measurements are performed on a homemade TAS system. The TAS technique used here is derived from the 

RAS  apparatus  with  Aspnes  configuration  [47],  and  measures  the  transmission  anisotropy  of  transparent 

samples. Further details of the experimental setup can be found in Ref. [21]. The samples are investigated in a 

gas flow reactor equipped with a silica window enabling the TAS measurements during gas cycles. After purging 

of the cell with pure Ar for 24 hours in order to eliminate any possible contamination, the samples are exposed 

alternately  to  pure  Ar  and  to  various  H2/Ar  mixtures  at  atmospheric  pressure.  For  this  purpose,  different 

concentrations of H2 in Ar are prepared in a dedicated bottle by the following procedure. The mixture bottle is 
vacuumed whilst heated to 3.10-3 mbar for 24 h. It is then filled with 2.5 bar of H2 and completed to 4 bar with 

Ar. The bottle is then emptied to atmospheric pressure and refilled to 4 bar with Ar. By using this procedure 

several times, accurate proportions of H2 in Ar down to a few ppm can be obtained. The experiments in the gas 

flow reactor are undertaken at atmospheric pressures and at 22°C, and the gas flows are fixed to 1000 sccm. 

These  large  flows  are  used  to  rapidly  switch  from  pure  Ar  to  the  chosen  concentration,  and  vice-versa.  For 

measurements  performed  with  dry  or  with  humid  air  as  carrying  gas,  a  similar  procedure  for  preparing  the 

mixture is used. 

3. Results and discussion 

3.1. Microscopic and optical characterisations 

The SEM image of a typical Pd film, obtained by vacuum deposition of Pd with mass thickness approximately 

equal to 1.9 nm is shown in Fig.1.a. The nanostructured Pd film is porous, and made up of elongated islands, 

separated  by  trenches.  These  islands  appear  to  be  formed  by  agglomerated  NPs  of  size  around  10  nm, 

separated by narrow gaps, and they are in majority oriented close to the direction normal to the evaporation 

orientation, indicated by the arrow. The morphological anisotropy of the film is better seen in the 2D Fourier 

transform of the SEM image (Fig.1.b).

the Pd blocks and narrow gaps used for modelling the optical response of the film. The arrow indicates 

the orientation of the vacuum deposition. 

The optical properties of the film are shown in Fig.2, where the absorbance, given by (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8), where T is 

the transmission of the sample, is drawn for light polarisation either parallel or perpendicular to the direction 

of evaporation. It shows a clear dichroism. The spectrum measured under parallel polarisation displays a broad 

resonance centred around 500 nm, whereas the spectrum for perpendicular polarisation does not exhibit such 

a maximum. The maximum of absorbance around 500 nm is due to LSPR located within the Pd film. Plasmonic 

absorptions have been previously observed in porous films and in films formed by agglomerated NPs for other 

metals,  e.g.  Ag,  Au  or  Al,  and  have  been  ascribed  to  LSPR  located  on  the  nanoparticles  in  close  interaction 

or/and  on  the  voids  within  porous  and  granular  films  [48–54].  Accurately  modelling  the  optical  response  of 

such an irregular film on a substrate is a huge challenge, and would at least demand the exact knowledge of the 

shape, size and distribution of the interacting NPs in the islands, and also to account for multipolar effects and 

interaction with the substrate [50,51,54–58]. Consequently, a simplified theoretical model is used in this study 

to reproduce the experimental data. The islands forming the nanostructured porous Pd film are represented by 

distributions of elongated metal blocks separated by gaps (as indicated in the schematic of Fig.1.c). The optical 

response and the LSPR supported by such a lamellar film, can be obtained within an effective medium theory, 

as described by Aspnes [59]. Two effective dielectric functions are then obtained describing the film’s optical 

response in the two main directions, x and y, of the slab: 

(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) (cid:12) (cid:13)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) (cid:16) (cid:6)1 (cid:2) (cid:13)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:18)

where  (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) is the dielectric function of bulk Pd and (cid:9)(cid:18) the dielectric function of the empty gaps, i.e. 1 for 

gas. 0 (cid:23) (cid:13) (cid:23) 1 is the fraction of Pd in the film.

No  resonance  (related  to  a  maximum  in  (cid:9)(cid:10),(cid:19)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8))  can  be  obtained  for  x  polarisation,  whereas,  for  y 

polarisation, LSPR localised in the gaps are obtained for values of (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) given by the pole of (cid:9)(cid:19)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8), i.e. by: 

(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) (cid:12) (cid:2)(cid:13) (cid:6)1 (cid:2) (cid:13)(cid:8)

.  The  dielectric  function  of  Pd  has  a  shape  similar  to  that  of  a  Drude  function  and  the 

LSPR is located in the visible/infrared range for values of f ≥ 0.9 (See the Supplementary Material). Typically, 

the LSPR is at 350 nm for f = 0.9 and at 500 nm for f = 0.95. However, the calculation for a given f leads to a 

narrower  and  sharper  resonance  than  what  is  observed  (Fig.S.2).  In  order  to  reproduce  the  observed 

broadening of the LSPR, the actual disordered nanostructure of the sample is taken into account by considering 

a  distribution  of  values  for  f.  Using  the  dielectric  function  experimentally  obtained  for  Pd  by  Johnson  and 

Christy  [60]  allows  one  to  nicely  reproduce  the  experimental  absorbance,  as  shown  in  Fig.2  where  the 

calculated absorbances in both directions are drawn in continuous lines. The mass thickness of the film is also 

obtained  and  found  to  be  1.4  nm,  close  to  the  value  estimated  from  the  quartz  balance.  The  maximum  of 

absorbance  around  500  nm  corresponds  to  polarisation  of  light  normal  to  the  gaps,  with  a  distribution  of  f 

ranging from 0.85 to 1. It is worth noticing that the Pd film could have been modelled in a different simplified 

way:  the  islands  formed  by  the  small  agglomerated  NPs  could  be  considered  as  being  larger  elongated  NPs, 

which  also  display  shape-dependent  LSPR.  Details  of  the  calculations  and  deeper  discussion  are  given  in  the 

Supplementary Material.

3.2. Exposure to atmospheric pressure of Ar and H2 

By using the TAS method, the transmission anisotropy (TA), (cid:26)(cid:7) (cid:7)⁄ , is directly measured on the sample placed in 

the gas flow reactor and is given by:  

(cid:27)(cid:28)

(cid:29)⊥(cid:20)(cid:29)∥
(cid:21) (cid:31)⁄  (cid:29)⊥!(cid:29)∥"

(2) 

where  T⊥  and  T∥  are  the  transmissions  of  the  sample  for  polarisations  perpendicular  and  parallel  to  the 
evaporation direction. The TA spectrum measured under pure Ar at atmospheric pressure is drawn in Fig.3.a. It 

confirms  the  optical  anisotropy  shown  in  Fig.2,  for  absorbance  measurements  in  both  polarisations.  The  TA 

goes  through  zero  as  the  two  spectra  of  Fig.2  cross  each  other.  When  the  sample  is  exposed  to  pure  H2  at 

atmospheric pressure, the TA spectrum also drawn in Fig.3.a. is strongly modified and its intensity is reduced. 
7 

 
 
 
   
 
After  purging  the  reactor  with  Ar,  the  signal  reverts  back  to  its  initial  state,  hence  showing  the  perfect 

reversibility of the phenomenon. The effect of H2 exposure can be ascribed to the absorption of hydrogen by 
the Pd NPs, leading to the formation of the b -phase PdHx and, consequently, to a strong change in its dielectric 
function. In order to reproduce the TA spectrum under H2, it is necessary to use the dielectric function of the b -

phase  PdHx.  However,  to  our  knowledge,  no  reliable  dielectric  functions  of  hydrogenated  Pd  have  been 

determined  experimentally.  Instead,  using  first  principle  methods,  Silkin  et  al.  have  calculated  the  dielectric 

functions for pure Pd and hydrogenated PdHx with different values of x [30]. The important aspect here is to 

show  that  the  change  in  the  dielectric  function  of  the  nanostructured  Pd  film,  due  to  formation  of  hydride, 

does explain the experimental observation. The TA spectrum measured under Ar (Fig.3.a) is reproduced with a 

Pd anisotropic nanostructured film and Silkin’s dielectric functions following analogous steps as shown in the 

previous paragraph. The result given in Fig.3.b is in good agreement with the experimental TA of Fig.3.a. The 

obtained parameters describing the nanostructured anisotropic film are very similar, although not identical, to 

those previously obtained with the experimental Johnson and Christy dielectric function [60], as explained in 

the Supplementary Material. Keeping these parameters and replacing the dielectric function of Pd with those 

of PdH0.33, PdH0.5 and PdH0.67 leads to a strong decrease of the TA, as shown in Fig.3.b. A very good agreement 

is found between the experimental TA spectrum under H2 and the calculation for PdH0.33, though the expected 

Pd  hydride  should  be  closer  to  PdH0.5  or  PdH0.67.  This  result  can  be  due  to  the  difficulty  in  accurately 

determining the dielectric functions of crystals with ab-initio methods. Indeed, discrepancies exist between the 

experimental and the calculated dielectric functions for pure Pd, respectfully obtained by Johnson and Christy 

and by Silkin et al. (see the Supplementary Material). It can also be wondered whether the known expansion of 

PdHx with respect to pure Pd could explain this difference. [29] However, we verified that taking into account 

this effect in the calculation did not strongly modify the results for PdH0.5 or PdH0.67. Finally, it is also likely that 

the actual H concentration is smaller than in bulk: it has indeed been shown that H concentration within Pd at a 

given H2 pressure is smaller for NPs than for bulk [61]. Nevertheless, the above comparison does show that the 

observed change of the TA signal is indeed due to the formation of Pd hydride, which modifies and reduces the 

LSPR  in  the  Pd  gaps.  This  illustrates  that  the  present  nanostructured  porous  films  are  quite  reactive  to  H2 

absorption and can be used for sensing smaller amounts of H2, even when solely the α-phase is obtained, as 

shown in next paragraph.

3.3. Pressure cycles of Ar and H2 in Ar 

The real-time experiments consists in measuring the change of the TA signal, ΔS, as a function of time, at a 

given wavelength, during exposure cycles to pure Ar and H2 in Ar with decreasing concentrations. The chosen 

working wavelength is where the largest change in TA within the investigated wavelength range is observed, 

therefore λ = 885 nm (see Fig.3.a). An optical offset is added in order to have a TA value close to zero under Ar 

to  increase  the  sensitivity  of  the  measurements.  The  experiments  are  performed  with  reducing  partial 
pressures from 1 bar to 2·10-6 bar of H2 in Ar at atmospheric pressure, which corresponds to H2 concentration 

in Ar varying from 100% to 0.0002% (2 ppm). The results are drawn in Fig.4. Similar results are obtained with 

other Pd samples. 

When  the  gas  is  switched  from  Ar  to  H2  in  Ar,  the  signal  change  ΔS  is  almost  immediate  and  positive,  as 

expected  from  Fig.3.a.  When  exposed  back  to  Ar,  the  signal  reverts  quickly,  and  eventually  the  sample 

regenerates  to  its  initial  state.  Fig.4  shows  that  the  sample  follows  three  different  behaviours.  At  high 

concentrations of H2 in Ar, between 100% to 4%, ΔS is large and quickly saturates within a few seconds or less; 

its intensity is almost unchanged throughout the range. At low concentrations, 0.2% and below, the signal is 

about 10 to 100 times smaller. The intensity depends on the concentration of H2, but saturation is also rather 

quickly  reached.  Fig  4  also  shows  that  the  detection  limit  in  the  present  case  is  about  2  to  10  ppm.  At  1% 

though, the signal behaves differently; the increase is also fast, but saturation is not reached, even after 1000 s 

under H2 in Ar. The intensity is also intermediate between the high and the low pressure regimes. These three 

behaviours  correspond  to  the  different  Pd  hydride  phases  that  are  schematised  in  Fig.5.a  for  different 

temperatures, where the relation between the pressure and the proportion x of H in PdHx is drawn. The region 

on the left hand side of Fig.4 corresponding to H2 percentages between 100% to 4% (1 to 0.04 bar) correlates 

to the formation of the dense β-phase. The region on the right hand side, corresponding to percentages from 

0.2% (0.002 bar) and lower,  correlates to the formation of the dilute α-phase.  The  experimental point at 1% 

corresponds to the co-existence of both phases, where the b -phase is progressively formed. 

The  H2  partial  pressures  as  a  function  of  the  maximum  signal  change  ΔS  reached  for  every  pressure  is 

displayed in Fig.5.b.  It shows that the shape is perfectly analogous to the phase diagram in Fig.5.a. The phase 

diagram for bulk Pd determined at 20°C is also drawn as a function of the H/Pd ratio x in the hydride (upper 

abscise) on Fig.5.b (taken from Ref.  [29]). The scale of this latter axis has been chosen so the phase diagram 

obtained  in  our  experiment  (blue  circles)  is  superimposed  with  the  bulk  phase  diagram  (red  dots).  This 

demonstrates that the observed change in the TAS signal can provide a measurement of the H concentration in 

the  Pd  film  after  calibration,  although  it  cannot  be  inferred  from  this  superposition  that  the  H/Pd  ratio  x 

indicated on the upper abscise does exactly correspond to our experimental results. It has indeed been shown 

that, for nanoparticles, the phase diagram is very similar, although the shape and the width of the terrace, and 

the H concentration, depend on their size [33,61] .

A way to even more enhance the sensitivity of such a system and to determine amounts of the order of 1 

ppm  or  less,  could  be  to  increase  the  optical  anisotropy  of  the  Pd  film.  This  is  shown  in  the  Supplementary 

Material (paragraph S.4), where the TAS measured for three different Pd samples are shown, together with the 

cycles obtained when switching from Ar to 4% H2 in Ar. The anisotropy is related to the morphology of the film, 

which  in  turn  is  related  to  the  preparation  conditions  (thickness  of  the  Pd  film,  angle  of  the  deposition, 

deposition rate, deposition temperature, possible annealing temperature...). A complete investigation of these 

parameters would consequently be important for the development and optimisation of this method but is out 

of the scope of the present article.

Fig 6. Plot of the pressure of H2 against the H/Pd ratio in log-log scales. The black dots are the experimental 

data. The blue line gives a fitting of the data with a slope of 2.36. The red curve shows Sieverts’ law with a slope 

of 2. 

In  order  to  quantitatively  relate  ΔS  to  the  H/Pd  ratio  x  for  low  pressures  of  H2,  one  must  consider  the 

dielectric function of dilute PdHx compounds calculated by Silkin et al. Although they did not present results for 

values smaller than x = 0.125, their dielectric functions for Pd and for PdH0.125 being very close, it is reasonable 

to consider intermediate functions obtained by interpolation for x £

 0.125. The effect of a small value of x, e.g. 

equal  to  0.04,  two  times  larger  than  the  density  limit  of  the  α-phase,  is  shown  as  an  illustration  in  Fig.3.b. 

(purple  dotted  spectrum).  The  calculation  procedure  is  explained  in  the  Supplementary  Material.  This 

illustrates  that  the  change  of  transmission  signal  for  small  amount  of  H  in  Pd  is  indeed  weak,  and  that  the 

present  differential  method  based  on  the  TAS  is  necessary  to  measure  such  minute  changes.  By  using  the 

above procedure, one can determine the values of x from the measurement of ΔS for every H2 partial pressures 

in the a
-phase. The so-obtained values are drawn as abscises in the upper part of Fig.5.c. for pressures lower 
than 2.10-3 bar (0.2%).  For p(H2) = 6·10-4 bar, the H/Pd ratio obtained is 0.016. This almost corresponds to the 
complete α-phase.  For the higher pressure of p(H2)  = 2·10-3 bar, the H/Pd ratio is  0.031.  In this case, the α-
11 

 
 
 
 
 
phase has saturated and the β-phase has started to form. From that point on, this procedure for determining x 

is thus no longer valid as the change of the dielectric function must now account for the development of the β-

phase.  

The partial pressure of H2 against the so-determined H/Pd ratio x, in the α-phase, is drawn in log-log diagram 

in Fig.6. It shows a linear relationship, with a slope equal to 2.36 up to x = 0.016. The deviation from the linear 

dependence, which starts slightly from the value of x = 0.031, confirms that the β-phase is starting to form. The 

point determined by the same procedure, for p(H2) = 10-2  bar, and which gives x »

 0.15, is clearly out of the 

linear evolution, which was indeed expected as, for this pressure, the two phases are coexisting. Coming back 

to the initial evolution, Sieverts’ law [12] indicates that the H/Pd ratio x should be proportional to the square 

root of the pressure, i.e. the points should be aligned with a slope of 2 (slope = 1/0.5), which is drawn in Fig.6 

(red). The measured slope (slope = 1/0.43) is thus in variance with the Sieverts’ law. This deviation is most likely 

related to the complex dissociation process of H2 molecules on the surface of the Pd NPs. While Sieverts’ law 

corresponds to a second order, Langmuir-type, dissociation of H2, i.e. that two empty sites are necessary for 

the reaction to take place, it has been shown that the dissociation on the (111) surface actually involves more 

than  two  empty  sites  and  therefore  that  the  reaction  deviates  from  the  expected  Langmuir  process  [62,63]. 

However, a detailed analysis of this process is out of the scope of the present article. 

3.4. Response time 

As well as the detection limit, a second important aspect regarding H2 sensing is its response time.  Two ways 

can be considered to measure the response time. For qualitative  measurements, which are crucial for safety 

consideration, one can define the time, tdetect, it takes for the sensor to provide a significant response, i.e. the 

time it takes to register the presence of H2 in the atmosphere. On the other hand quantitative measurements 

conventionally consider the time, t90, after which 90% of the signal is reached. According to European and US 

authorities, hydrogen sensors are required to have a response time of less than 1 s for industrial applications 

[64]. 

In Fig 7, the evolution of the TA signal measured as a function of time on another sample, is shown in detail 

for three concentrations of H2: 63%, 4% and 0.25%. These are recorded at a faster rate of 0.1 s per point, and 

correspond in the two former cases to the explosive concentration range (and leading to the formation of the 

β-phase), and in the latter case to the sub-flammable range (and leading to the α-phase). For 63% H2 in Ar, t90 = 

3.5  s,  and  tdetect  ≤  0.2  s,  whilst  at  4%  and  0.25%,  t90  increases  to  32  s  and  40  s  and  tdetect  to  0.6  s  and  1  s, 

respectively. The measured response time t90 is actually sample dependent, and varies, e.g. for 4% of H2, from 

about  20  to  35  seconds.  Table  1  summarises  the  values  of  t90  and  tdetect  determined  for  two  samples  .  The 

obtained values for the response time t90 at concentrations between 63% to 1% are better or of the same order 

as previously reported for Pd-based plasmonic sensing systems (10 s for 100% [25], 30 s for 4% [31], more than 
12 

 
 
 
 
60 s for 4% [24], 20 s for 100% and 60 s for 1% [65], less than 90 s for 0.2% [23]). Smaller response times (t90 = 1 

s)  have  been  previously  observed  in  plasmonic  sensors  using  Pd,  but  not  with  H2  in  a  carrying  gas  at 

atmospheric  pressure;  instead,  the  experiments  were  undertaken  in  vacuum,  where  the  H2  pressure  was 

increased from vacuum to 40 mbar [20]. The increase of t90 observed in the present experiments, from 3.5 s at 

63%  to  20  or  32  s  at  4%  is  likely  due  to  the  competition  between  physisorption  of  H2  molecules  at  the  NP 

surfaces,  prior  their  dissociation  [66],  and  transient  physisorption  of  Ar  atoms.  This  competition  between  H2 

molecules and atoms or molecules of the carrying gas appears to be an intrinsic limitation which seems difficult 

to overcome for a faster quantitative determination of H2 concentration in a gas. Results with air as a carrying 

gas, given in the next paragraph, reinforce this explanation. A second limitation for obtaining a fast response 

time occurs for partial pressures corresponding to the mixed a

-phase / β-phase. This is quite clear from Fig.4, 

which shows that saturation is not reached at 1% of H2, even after 1000 s. Nevertheless, the detection time is 

still  below  1s  at  1%  and  at  0.25%,  i.e.  below  the  flammability  range  and  thus  within  the  requirements  for 

hydrogen sensors. For smaller partial pressures, tdetect increases to about 10 s at 0.06% to 50 s at 10 ppm, which 

is still an acceptable detection time for security applications.

Table 1. Response time of two samples when exposed to H2 in Ar at different concentrations. Sample 1 was 

recorded at a low rate (2 s/point) leading to a higher signal to noise ratio but slower response time. Sample 2 

was recorded at a much higher rate (0.1 s/point) leading to much faster response time. Unavailable values are 

marked by a dash. *: these values were recorded with a two seconds moving average. 

3.5. Selectivity ; H2 in dry or humid air. 

Selectivity of a gas sensor to the analytes against other possible reactants of the medium is an important point 

for practical applications. Pd is known to react strongly and specifically to dihydrogen, and the good selectivity 

of Pd-based sensors to H2 has been extensively shown in recent articles [67,68]. The carrying gas presented so 

far was chosen to be Ar due to its inertness to Pd, in order to investigate the intrinsic capabilities of the TAS 

method  with  comparison  to  previously  investigated  plasmonic  Pd-based  sensors.  Nevertheless,  we  have 

verified the  response of the  sample to pure O2, to pure  synthetic dry air and to 50% relative humidity in Ar, 

compared to pure Ar. The results obtained on another sample are shown in fig 8.a. The effect of these three 

gases is very small compared to a cycle of Ar and 4% H2 in Ar shown in fig 8.b. Indeed, to better see the effects, 

the signals were multiplied by twenty. They all show an increase in D S about 200 times less than that measured 

with 4% H2. This small D S can be interpreted as due to the reaction of O2 or of H2O on the surface of the Pd 

particles, leading to charge transfer between metallic Pd and the adsorbed molecules, in the same way as it has 

been shown previously for adsorption of oxygen and of hydrogen on gold [21,69,70].  

A second important point to determine for practical application of the present system is to investigate whether 

it is still reactive to H2 when the carrying gas is not a neutral gas but air, either dry or with water. To verify this, 

cycles  of  4%  H2  in  synthetic  dry  air  and  synthetic  humid  air  (relative  humidity  =  50%)  were  undertaken  and 

compared to cycles with 4% H2 in Ar. The results are plotted in fig 8.b. Each cycle exhibits the same increase in 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
intensity of the signal compared to the Ar cycle. The response time however is impacted by the presence of O2 

and of water in the carrying gas. In the case of dry air, t90 was increased by a factor of 2 (t90 = 50 s against 20 s 

in  Ar).  Whilst  in  humid  air,  the  response  time  was  much  slower  with  t90  =  250  s.  Similar  results  which  show 

different response times as a function of the carrying gas and of the presence of humidity have been obtained 

previously [68,71,72]. Yet, the detection time tdetect in this latter case is still lower than 1s as shown in the insert 

of fig 8.b. This shows that although the Pd might oxidise due to the presence of O2 or react with the water, its 

initial  reactivity  towards  hydrogen  is  not  inhibited,  making  such  system  efficient  for  security  applications.  A 

possible  way  for  solving  this  issue  of  larger  response  time  due  to  the  presence  of  water,  and  improve  the 

method  for  quantitative  measurements  in  humid  air,  would  be  to  protect  the  Pd  sensor  by  a  film  porous  to 

hydrogen but not to other molecules, especially water molecules. This has been recently achieved by using a 

film of metal-organic framework as a protective impermeable membrane [72].

Fig 8. (a) Effect of other gases: switch from Ar to pure O2; to pure air; to Ar with 50% relative humidity. The 
curves  have  been  multiplied  by  a  factor  of  20  and  vertically  shifted.  The  noise  is  smaller  for  the  2nd  curve, 

because of the use a longer integration time (1 s against 0.3 s). (b) change of the TAS signal for exposure to 4 % 

H2 in Ar; in dry air; in air with 50% relative humidity. The time scale is different for the first curve and for the 

two others. The zoom shows that the detection time tdetect is about 1 s in the latter case. 

4. Conclusion 

In this investigation, we have demonstrated the possibility of detecting as low as a few 10-6 bar, i.e. a few 

ppm,  of  H2  in  Ar,  using  an  ultra-high  sensitive  Pd  direct  sensing  method  based  on  LSPR  working  at  room 

temperature.  This  has  been  achieved  by  measuring  the  change  of  the  transmission  anisotropy  of  anisotropic 

nanostructured Pd film, at a single wavelength in real-time. The system presented in this paper shows a much 

greater  sensitivity  in  the  low  concentration  range  of  the  a

-phase,  with  respect  to  previous  LSPR  Pd  sensing 

demonstrations, based on the determination of the spectral shift. Moreover, the resulting measurements are 
quantitative and permits one to determine the partial pressure of H2 in a wide pressure range, from a few 10-6 
bar (a few ppm) to about a few 10-2

 bar. This point is an important aspect for safety consideration as it is still 

16 

 
 
 
 
D

largely  below  the  flammability  limit  of  4%.  Furthermore,  the  time  for  detecting  the  presence  of  H2  in  the 

carrying  gas  is  small,  even  at  low  partial  pressure  of  H2,  and  varies  from  0.6  s  at  4%  to  50  s  at  10  ppm.  The 

simplicity  of  the  sample  elaboration  is  key  to  making  this  method  competitive  as  it  only  consists  in  the 

evaporation at an oblique angle of a few nanometres of Pd on a glass substrate. In addition, the present optical 

apparatus is much less bulky compared to conventional methods as it works at a single wavelength and does 

not require a monochromator. Moreover, being a differential technique, it is not perturbed by ambient light. It 

therefore paves the way for developing light and portable miniaturised systems for easy, fast and low-cost H2 

sensing in a wide range of “real-world” environments. Deep investigation in real conditions is the next step to 

be  undertaken.  First  results  for  H2  in  air  show  indeed,  at  least  for  4%  of  H2,  the  same  sensitivity  as  H2  in  Ar. 

However, the presence of water in air increases the response time, although the detection time is still of the 

order of 1s. The effect of different concentrations of H2 in dry air and in air with different quantities of humidity 

should therefore be the subject of further investigation in order to check the possible application of such Pd-

based systems for developing actual H2 sensors.

S.1. Comparison between dielectric function for Pd and for PdHx 

Figure  S.1.  shows  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the  experimental  dielectric  function  for  Pd, 
determined by Johnson and Christy (JC) [1], and of the theoretical dielectric functions for Pd, PdH0.3 
and  PdH0.67,  calculated  by  Silkin  et  al  [2].  It  is  clear  from  this  comparison,  that  the  experimental 
(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) is not perfectly reproduced by the calculation, although the main behaviour is correct. 

When using the theoretical (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) and  (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)$(cid:10)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) for fitting the change of the TA spectra of Figure 
3.a, obtained when exposing the sample to H2, there is a good agreement by using the value x=0.33 
for PdHx. This corresponds mainly to a decrease in intensity of both the real and the imaginary parts 
of    (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8),  as  shown  in  Fig.S.1.b.  In  contrast,  for  PdH0.67,  the  dielectric  function  displays  a  feature 
around 400-500 nm, which is due to interband transitions in the well-organised PdH0.67 crystal. This is 
the origin of the negative feature observed in the corresponding calculated TA spectrum around 500 
nm  drawn  in  Fig.3.b.  The  fact  that  it  is  not  observed  in  the  experiment  could  be  due  to  a  random 
organisation of the PdHx crystal formed when the Pd NPs are exposed to pure H2.

S.2. Modelling the optical absorption of the nanostructured anisotropic Pd film. 

Formula 1.a and 1.b are used in order to reproduce the optical absorption of the Pd film.

(S.1.a) 

(S.1.b) 

No resonance (related to a maximum in (cid:9)(cid:10),(cid:19)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8))) is obtained for parallel polarisation, whereas, for 
perpendicular  polarisation,  LSPR  localised  in  the  gaps  between  the  interacting  NPs  forming  the 
islands, are obtained for values of (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) given by the pole of (cid:9)(cid:19)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8), i.e. by: 

 (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) = −(cid:13) (cid:6)1 − (cid:13)(cid:8)
,

with  (cid:9)(cid:18)
reached in the working range (Fig.S.1.a).  

  taken  equal  to  1.  This  corresponds  to  negative  values  for  Re((cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8))  which  are  indeed 

Fig.  S.2.  shows  the  experimental  absorbance  measured  for  perpendicular  polarisation  (taken  from 
Fig.2). With a value f = 0.95, the observed maximum at 500 nm is reproduced, but the resonance is 
much narrower than in the experiment (blue curve). Taking into account a distribution of f, ranging 
from about 0.85 to 1, permits us to correctly reproduce the experimental spectrum (black curve). The 
distribution  of  f  obtained  in  the  article,  where  both  T//  and  T^   have  been  fitted  (Fig.2),  is  drawn  in 
Fig.S.3. 

It  is  worth  noticing  that  the  Pd  film  could  have  been  modelled  differently.  The  islands  formed  by 
agglomerated  NPs  can  also  be  considered  as  being  elongated  NPs  with  spheroidal  shape,  of  which 
the LSPR is located at a wavelength which is a function of their aspect ratio. Indeed, the polarisability 
of such a spheroid is given by 

α’ = V

)(cid:6)ω(cid:8)(cid:20))*
)*!+,(cid:6))(cid:6)ω(cid:8)(cid:20))*(cid:8)		     

and the LSPR is obtained for  (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) = (cid:6). − 1(cid:8) .⁄

(S.4) 

which  is  similar  to  eq  S.2  where  f  is  replaced  by  1-L.  Consequently,  the  resonance  of  a  Pd  particle 
with an aspect ratio equal to 0.05 is similar to the parallel slabs with f = 0.95, and is drawn in Fig. S.2 
for comparison (red curve).

fitting TA with Silkin dielectric function (red line). 

S.3. Modelling the Transmission Anisotropy of the nanostructured anisotropic Pd film. 

As  indicated  in  the  main text, the  TA spectrum  is  directly  fitted  by  the  use of the  theoretical  Silkin  
(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8), which gives a distribution of f which is only slightly different from the previous one. It is also 
23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
drawn in Fig.S.3 and compared to the one obtained above. This indicates that the fitting of T// and T^  
with experimental  (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) and the fitting of TA with theoretical  (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) are in correct agreement.  

S.4. Transmission Anisotropy Spectra of different samples and response to H2. 

Fig.  S.4.a.  shows  the  TAS  measured  for  three  Pd  samples.  The  optical  anisotropy  is  expected  to 
depend on the morphology of the samples, but an exhaustive investigation has not been done so far. 
The sensitivity to hydrogen is directly related to the intensity of the TAS, as it is illustrated in Fig. S.4.b 
for cycles of exposure to 4 % H2 in Ar: the higher the optical anisotropy is, the higher the sensitivity.

S.5. Modification of the dielectric function of Pd. 

Silkin et al. calculations for the dielectric function of PdHx show a small change when x changes from 
0 (pure Pd) to 0.125. In order to take into account the presence of a small amount of H in PdHx, one 
can consider the following intermediate dielectric function, given by a linear relation, for x between 0 
and 0.125: 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(cid:10)

0.(cid:21)(cid:31)1 2(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)$/3.456(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) − (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8)7   

(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)$/(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) = (cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:15)(cid:6)(cid:11)(cid:8) + 	
Using  this  dielectric  function  to  calculate  the  value  of  the  signal  TA  at  885  nm  with  the  above 
determined distribution for f, which correctly reproduces the spectrum with pure Pd (following the 
procedure indicated in S.3), the values of x can be obtained for each measured value of the TA signal. 
The TA thus obtained are plotted in Figs 5.c and 6 of the main article.
