ABSTRACT

We present high-resolution and multiline observations of a C2-class solar ﬂare (SOL2019-05-06T08:47), which occurred
in NOAA AR 12740 on May 6, 2019. The rise, peak, and decay phases of the ﬂare were recorded continuously and
quasi-simultaneously in the Ca ii K line with the CHROMIS instrument and in the Ca ii 8542 Å and Fe i 6173 Å lines
with the CRISP instrument at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. The observations in the chromospheric Ca ii lines
exhibit intense brightening near the ﬂare footpoints. At these locations, a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium inversion
code was employed to infer the temperature, magnetic ﬁeld, line-of-sight (LOS) velocity, and microturbulent velocity
stratiﬁcation in the ﬂaring atmosphere. The temporal analysis of the inferred temperature at the ﬂare footpoints shows
that the ﬂaring atmosphere from log τ500 ∼ −2.5 to −3.5 is heated up to 7 kK, whereas from log τ500 ∼ −3.5 to −5 the
inferred temperature ranges between ∼ 7.5 kK and ∼ 11 kK. During the ﬂare peak time, the LOS velocity shows both
upﬂows and downﬂows around the ﬂare footpoints in the upper chromosphere and lower chromosphere, respectively.
Moreover, the temporal analysis of the LOS magnetic ﬁeld at the ﬂare points exhibits a maximum change of ∼ 600 G.
After the ﬂare, the LOS magnetic ﬁeld decreases to the non-ﬂaring value, exhibiting no permanent or step-wise change.
The analysis of response functions to the temperature, LOS magnetic ﬁeld, and velocity shows that the Ca ii lines
exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the deeper layers (i.e., log τ500 ∼ −3) of the ﬂaring atmosphere, whereas for the non-
ﬂaring atmosphere they are mainly sensitive around log τ500 ∼ −4. We suggest that a fraction of the apparent increase
in the LOS magnetic ﬁeld at the ﬂare footpoints may be due to the increase in the sensitivity of the Ca ii 8542 Å line
in the deeper layers, where the ﬁeld strength is relatively strong. The rest may be due to magnetic ﬁeld reconﬁguration
during the ﬂare. In the photosphere, we do not notice signiﬁcant changes in the physical parameters during the ﬂare or
non-ﬂare times. Our observations illustrate that even a less intense C-class ﬂare can heat the deeper layers of the solar
chromosphere, mainly at the ﬂare footpoints, without aﬀecting the photosphere.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂares are sudden energy release phenomena that last
from a few minutes to hours, resulting in plasma heating,
particle acceleration, and energy release in the entire elec-
tromagnetic spectrum. A signiﬁcant amount of energy, up
to 1032 erg, is released in an intense solar ﬂare. It is be-
lieved that they are caused by the magnetic reconnection
or re-conﬁguration of magnetic ﬁeld lines in the corona, con-
verting the magnetic energy into the kinematic and ther-
mal energy. For an overview of solar ﬂares, we refer to
Fletcher et al. (2011), Shibata & Magara (2011), Janvier
et al. (2015), and Benz (2017).

It is known that a major amount of energy is trans-
ported to the dense chromosphere along the coronal mag-
netic loops by accelerated particles or thermal conduction
or in the form of waves, although the processes that describe
this transfer are still a matter of debate (e.g., Kerr et al.
2016). Several decades of observational and theoretical in-
vestigations performed by various authors have revealed a
number of processes and mechanisms. For example, in the
collisional thick-target model (CTTM), the energetic parti-
cles produced at the reconnection site in the corona deposit
their energy via Coulomb collisions in the chromosphere.

This deposition of energy gives rise to intense brightening
and emission of hard and soft X-rays near the location of the
coronal magnetic footpoints (Brown 1971; Hudson 1972). In
addition to this, the transfer of energy to the lower atmo-
sphere via Alfvén waves was ﬁrst proposed by Emslie &
Sturrock (1982). Later, Fletcher & Hudson (2008) demon-
strated that Alfvénic perturbations in the coronal ﬁeld lines
can supply an adequate amount of energy to heat the chro-
mosphere through various wave dissipation mechanisms.
Recently, using radiation hydrodynamic simulations, Kerr
et al. (2016) demonstrated that both mechanisms (Alfvén
wave dissipation and electron beam collisional losses) are
capable of producing strong chromospheric heating.

Several observations have shown that a large amount
of the ﬂare energy is radiated in the chromosphere. There-
fore, this layer is of great importance and is key for un-
derstanding how and where the ﬂare energy is transported
and dissipated. Some of the most common chromospheric
lines utilized to investigate ﬂares are Hα, Ca ii H & K,
Ca ii 8542 Å, and He i 10830 Å. These spectral lines have
been used to construct semiempirical models of a ﬂaring
atmosphere by several authors (Machado & Linsky 1975;
Falchi & Mauas 2002; Sasso et al. 2014; Judge et al. 2014;

Kleint 2017; Kuridze et al. 2017, 2018; Libbrecht et al. 2019;
Vissers et al. 2020).

In addition to other physical parameters, the magnetic
ﬁeld plays a crucial role in the triggering and development
of a ﬂare (Bobra & Couvidat 2015). Thus, for a comprehen-
sive modeling of ﬂares, spectropolarimetric observations of
spectral lines that sample diﬀerent layers of the solar at-
mosphere are needed to infer the stratiﬁcation of the mag-
netic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld changes in the photosphere
during strong ﬂares have been investigated by several au-
thors as they have been commonly observed from vari-
ous space- and ground-based observations (Sudol & Har-
vey 2005; Petrie & Sudol 2010; Maurya et al. 2012; Castel-
lanos Durán et al. 2018). In a recent statistical analysis
of 75 solar ﬂares, Castellanos Durán et al. (2018) found
that most of the intense ﬂares (>M1.6-class) exhibit abrupt
and permanent magnetic ﬁeld changes in the photosphere.
To investigate the presence of such changes in the chro-
mosphere, observations with exceedingly high polarimetric
sensitivity are required. However, chromospheric polarime-
try during a ﬂare is challenging due to a generally lower
magnetic ﬁeld strength in the chromosphere, the scarcity
of sensitive spectral lines, the seeing-induced limitations,
instrumental constraints, and the ﬂare’s unpredictability.
As a result, we have limited ﬂare studies that were per-
formed with the chromospheric polarimetry. Therefore, it
is still not fully understood how the magnetic ﬁeld or other
physical parameters behave in the chromosphere during the
diﬀerent stages of a ﬂare.

The Ca ii 8542 Å line has been one of the most stud-
ied lines in investigations of the magnetic, thermodynamic,
and kinematic structure of the chromosphere (e.g., Pietarila
et al. 2007; Cauzzi et al. 2008; de la Cruz Rodríguez et al.
2012; Kleint 2012; Quintero Noda et al. 2016; Kianfar et al.
2020; Pietrow et al. 2020). Spectropolarimetric observations
of ﬂares in the Ca ii 8542 Å line are now available from dif-
ferent ground-based instruments, for example the Interfer-
ometric Bidimensional Spectropolarimeter (IBIS; Cavallini
2006) and the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP;
Scharmer et al. 2008). The available inversion methods al-
low us to infer the physical parameters of the solar atmo-
sphere from such polarimetric observations (see de la Cruz
Rodríguez & van Noort 2017 and references therein).

Recently, Kleint (2017) detected a ﬁrst direct step-wise
change during a X1-class ﬂare in the chromospheric line-
of-sight (LOS) magnetic ﬁeld through spectropolarimetry
of the Ca ii 8542 Å line using the weak-ﬁeld approxima-
tion (WFA; Landi Degl’Innocenti & Landolﬁ 2004). They
reported stronger ﬁeld changes in the chromosphere com-
pared to their photospheric counterparts. Using a non-
local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) inversion of
the Ca ii 8542 Å line, Kuridze et al. (2017) found that
during a C8.4-class ﬂare, the temperature in the middle
and upper chromosphere is enhanced from ∼ 6.5 kK to
∼ 20 kK between log τ ∼ −3.5 and −5.5 in the ﬂar-
ing atmosphere, compared to a pre-ﬂare temperature of
∼ 5 − 10 kK. They also reported that the ﬂaring chro-
mosphere is dominated by downﬂowing condensations at
the formation height of the Ca ii 8542 Å line. Furthermore,
Kuridze et al. (2018) constructed a semiempirical model of
the ﬂaring atmosphere from the spectropolarimetric inver-
sion of the Ca ii 8542 Å line using the non-LTE NICOLE
code (Socas-Navarro et al. 2015). They reported that during

the ﬂare peak time the polarization signals become stronger
when compared to the pre-ﬂare and post-ﬂare proﬁles. They
also showed that the Ca ii 8542 Å line is more sensitive to
the lower atmosphere during the ﬂaring time.

Generally, a ﬂare inﬂuences diﬀerent layers of the so-
lar atmosphere almost simultaneously. Therefore, a single
spectral line may not encode suﬃcient information of all the
relevant physical parameters to fully characterize a ﬂare. A
more reliable ﬂaring atmosphere can be constructed from
the simultaneous investigation of multiple spectral lines
forming in diﬀerent parts of the solar atmosphere. In this
paper, we present a multiline investigation of a C2-class
ﬂare, which is observed simultaneously in three spectral
lines (Ca ii K, Ca ii 8542 Å, and Fe i 6173 Å). More im-
portantly, we also have simultaneous spectropolarimetric
observations in the photosphere (Fe i 6173 Å) and the chro-
mosphere (Ca ii 8542 Å). Such spectropolarimetric obser-
vations mapping two diﬀerent layers can be utilized to un-
derstand the magnetic ﬁeld topology and coupling of the
solar atmosphere (e.g., Yadav et al. 2019).

We employed a non-LTE inversion code to infer the at-
mospheric stratiﬁcation of the temperature, LOS velocity,
microturbulent velocity, and magnetic ﬁeld in the ﬂaring at-
mosphere, making use of all three lines simultaneously. The
purpose of this study is to investigate the temporal behavior
of the inferred parameters, mainly at the ﬂare footpoints,
in the solar atmosphere during ﬂare and non-ﬂare times.

This article is organized in the following manner. The
overview of observations and ﬂare are given in Sections
2 and 3, respectively. The analysis of spectropolarimet-
ric data is discussed in Sect. 4. The obtained results are
described in Sect. 5. Finally, the paper is summarized in
Sect. 6.

2. Observations and data reduction

Observations of the active region (AR) NOAA 12740, lo-
cated at N08E48 (µ=0.62), were recorded between 08:34
and 9:33 UT on May 6, 2019, with the CRisp Imaging
SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP; Scharmer et al. 2008) and
the CHROMospheric Imaging Spectrometer (CHROMIS;
Scharmer 2017) instruments at the Swedish 1-m Solar Tele-
scope (SST; Scharmer et al. 2003). Both instruments are

equipped with a dual Fabry-Pérot tunable ﬁlter, but CRISP
has additional polarimetric capabilities. The CRISP simul-
taneously recorded full spectropolarimetric data in the Ca ii
8542 Å and Fe i 6173 Å spectral lines. The Ca ii 8542 Å line
scans consisted of 17 wavelength positions spanning a range
of 1.4 Å around line center, with steps of 75 mÅ in the in-
ner wings and 125 mÅ at four outer wing positions, whereas
the Fe i 6173 Å spectral line was scanned at 15 wavelength

positions spanning a range of 0.5 Å around line center,
with steps of 35 mÅ in the inner wings and 50 mÅ in the
outer wings at four diﬀerent positions. The CRISP data
were obtained with a cadence of 21 sec with a pixel scale
of 0.057(cid:48)(cid:48). The CHROMIS recorded Ca ii K intensity pro-
ﬁles at 28 wavelength positions spanning a range of 3 Å
around line center, with steps of 65 mÅ in the inner wings
and an additional sampling at wavelength positions ±1.5 Å
and ±1.18 Å relative to the line center. In addition to this,
one point in the continuum at 4000 Å was also observed
with the CHROMIS instrument. The CHROMIS data have
a cadence of 15 sec and a pixel size of 0.0375(cid:48)(cid:48).

The data obtained with CRISP were reduced us-
ing the CRISPRED (de la Cruz Rodríguez et al. 2015)
post-processing pipeline, which includes image reconstruc-
tion through multi-object multi-frame blind deconvolu-
tion (MOMFBD; van Noort et al. 2005) and removal of
small-scale seeing-induced deformations. The CHROMIS
data were reduced using the CHROMISRED pipeline (Löf-
dahl et al. 2018). The CRISP data were aligned with the
CHROMIS data and resampled to the CHROMIS pixel
scale of 0.0375(cid:48)(cid:48). As the CRISP data were obtained with
a lower cadence, we interpolated the CRISP data to the
CHROMIS cadence using nearest-neighbor interpolation.
For all data, the intensity calibration was performed with
the quiet Sun data located close to the disk center after
taking into account the limb darkening, whereas the ab-
solute wavelengths were calibrated with the atlas proﬁles
given by Neckel & Labs (1984). In order to improve the
signal-to-noise of the polarization signals in the Ca ii 8542
Å line, we applied the denoising neural network described
in Díaz Baso et al. (2019). We checked that the noise re-
duction process does not aﬀect the strength of the signals.
Furthermore, we performed 2 × 2 pixel spatial binning to
enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, which resulted in a ﬁnal
resolution of 0.11(cid:48)(cid:48) per pixel.

In addition to the SST data, we also analyzed ultra-
violet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images ob-
served by the Atmosphere Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen
et al. 2012), as well as full-disk continuum images and
LOS magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) aboard the Solar Dy-
namic Observatory (SDO; Scherrer et al. (2012)). The AIA
takes full-disk images in seven EUV bands with a cadence
of 12 sec and in two UV bands at 1600 Å and 1700 Å
with a cadence of 24 sec. The spatial scale of AIA im-
ages is 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48)per pixel. All AIA and HMI images were cor-
rected using the standard solar software (SSW) routines
(e.g., aia_prep.pro and hmi_prep.pro). Finally, all AIA,
HMI, CRISP, and CHROMIS data were co-aligned using an
image cross-correlation approach. We note that the spatial
resolution and temporal cadence of the SDO and the SST
data are diﬀerent.

3. Overview of the ﬂare
A solar ﬂare is generally classiﬁed using the one-to-eight
scale of soft X-ray peak intensities, which are measured
by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
(GOES). The GOES X-ray ﬂux has revealed that AR 12740
produced several C- and M-class ﬂares (14 C-class and
one M-class) during its transit through the solar disk. The
ﬂare (SOL2019-05-06T08:47) observed with the SST is clas-
siﬁed by GOES as a C2 event. As illustrated in Fig. 1, this

Article number, page 4 of 14

ﬂare started at 08:41 UT, with its peak and stop times at
08:47 UT and 08:51 UT, respectively. Luckily, this event
was recorded under stable seeing conditions from 08:34 UT
to 09:33 UT at the SST, covering the rise, peak, and de-
cay phases of the ﬂare. Figure 2 displays the appearance
of the ﬂare in diﬀerent channels of the AIA instrument as
well as the SST data near the ﬂare peak time. The pho-
tospheric magnetograms derived from the CRISP Fe i line
demonstrate that the ﬂare originated from a complex mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration (see Fig. 2b). The observed AR
consists of a sunspot and a small pore with opposite polar-
ity. The temporal analysis reveals the presence of a small-
scale ﬂux-emerging region between the penumbra and the
pore region. This new ﬂux-emerging region may increase
the shearing and can create strong magnetic ﬁeld gradi-
ents, which might destabilize the magnetic ﬁeld and may
be responsible for the onset of the present ﬂare (Benz 2017,
and references therein).

Figures 2c–d show the appearance of enhanced chromo-
spheric intensity around ﬂare footpoints in the ﬁeld-of-view
(FOV) of CRISP and CHROMIS. One of the footpoints
lies close to the penumbral region of the sunspot, whereas
another one is located near a pore of opposite polarity. Re-
markably, as shown in Fig. 2, the counterpart of the ﬂare
footpoints are also present in the 1600 Å channel of the AIA
as intense brightenings. In contrast to the chromospheric
observations, we do not notice any signiﬁcant brightening
in the photospheric observations.

Furthermore, we observe that the atmosphere above the
photosphere is dynamic, and intense brightening is appar-
ent near ﬂare ribbons in all AIA/SDO channels. Images in
EUV 131 Å, 171 Å, 211 Å, and 304 Å display the hot coro-
nal ﬂaring loop connecting the two footpoints of opposite
polarity. The intensity saturation in 131 Å indicates the
presence of hot plasma (∼1 Mk) in the ﬂaring loop (see
Fig. 2e).

Figure 3 shows the temporal evolution of the observed
intensity proﬁles at selected pixels. During the ﬂaring time,
we observed a strong intensity enhancement in all channels
of the AIA, Ca ii K, and Ca ii 8542 Å lines. The temporal
evolution of X-rays observed by GOES is similar to the ﬂare
ribbon intensity observed in the Ca ii lines, which suggests
that the intensity emission observed in the chromospheric
lines might be mainly due to the heating of the chromo-
sphere.

4. Inversion of spectropolarimetric data

Generally, the magnetic ﬁeld vector and other thermody-
namic parameters of the solar atmosphere are inferred from
the interpretation of the observed Stokes proﬁles. Nowa-
days, there are several available methods to do this, such
as the WFA (Landi Degl’Innocenti & Landolﬁ 2004) and
the inversion of Stokes proﬁles under diﬀerent conditions.
Although non-LTE inversions are more accurate than the
WFA, they are computationally more expensive. Therefore,
in order to roughly infer the magnetic ﬁeld at the photo-
spheric and chromospheric levels for the full FOV, we em-
ployed a Milne-Eddington inversion code and the WFA,
respectively, as explained in the following section.

Yadav et al.: Stratiﬁcation of physical parameters in a C-class solar ﬂare using multiline observations

4.1. Milne-Eddington and weak-ﬁeld approximation

To infer the magnetic ﬁeld in the photosphere (using the
Fe i 6173 line), we employed the SPIN code (Yadav et al.
2017), which is based on the analytic solution of the radia-
tive transfer equation for polarized radiation in a Milne-
Eddington model atmosphere (Auer et al. 1977; del Toro
Iniesta 2003). During the inversion of all the Fe i scans, we
took into account the instrumental proﬁle of the CRISP
instrument.

The observed linear and circular polarization signal
strength in the Fe i line was suﬃcient to infer the mag-
netic ﬁeld vector in the photosphere. However, in the chro-
mosphere the linear polarization in the Ca ii 8542 Å line
was not suﬃcient to make a fair estimate of the magnetic
ﬁeld vector in the FOV. On the other hand, the strength in
the circular polarization was suﬃcient to estimate the LOS
magnetic ﬁeld (BLOS) using the WFA, which assumes that
the Zeeman splitting is smaller than the Doppler broaden-
ing of the line. To this aim, we employed a spatially reg-
ularized WFA method1, which is based on the imposition
of the Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov & Arsenin 1977).
More details regarding this algorithm are given in Morosin
et al. (2020).

4.2. Multiline inversion

We employed the parallel non-LTE STockholm Inversion
Code2 (STiC; de la Cruz Rodríguez et al. 2016; de la Cruz
Rodríguez et al. 2019) to simultaneously infer the atmo-
spheric stratiﬁcation of temperature, velocities, and mag-
netic ﬁeld from the Fe i 6173 Å, Ca ii K, and Ca ii 8542 Å
spectral lines. The STiC inversion code is built around a
modiﬁed version of the RH code (Uitenbroek 2001) in or-
der to derive the atomic populations by assuming statistical
equilibrium and a plane-parallel geometry. The equation of
state is borrowed from the Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME)
computer code described in Piskunov & Valenti (2017). The
radiative transport equation is solved using cubic Bezier
solvers (de la Cruz Rodríguez & Piskunov 2013).

For the inversion of the Stokes proﬁles, we considered
the Ca ii 8542 Å line in non-LTE conditions, under the as-
sumption of complete frequency redistribution, while the
Ca ii K line was synthesized in non-LTE conditions with
partial redistribution eﬀects of scattered photons. We used
the fast approximation proposed by Leenaarts et al. (2012).
The Fe i 6173 Å line was treated under the assumption of
LTE conditions. We inverted all the Stokes parameters in
the Fe i 6173 Å and Ca ii 8542 Å lines, but only Stokes I in
the Ca ii K line.

In order to construct a good initial model for the in-
version process, we ﬁrst performed inversions of a few sets
of pixels, mainly located near the ﬂare ribbons, using three
diﬀerent cycles (see Table 1). In the ﬁrst cycle we consid-
ered an atmospheric model derived from the FAL-C model
(Fontenla et al. 1993) by interpolation to 63 depth points
from log τ500 = −7.8 to +1.0. The outputs from this ﬁrst in-
version were then used to train a neural network to retrieve
the mapping between the Stokes parameters and the physi-
cal quantities of the output atmospheres. Then we used the
new model atmosphere retrieved from the neural network

as an initial guess model for the ﬁnal inversion. Since the
neural network outputs were already close to the ﬁnal so-
lution, the successive inversion process beneﬁted from it in
two diﬀerent ways: Local minima were successfully avoided,
and the number of iterations was signiﬁcantly reduced, thus
speeding up the whole inversion process and providing more
reliable results. A similar approach making use of a neural
network in order to produce an initial guess model was also
performed by Kianfar et al. (2020).

Since the inversion of all the frames in the whole FOV
using the STiC code is computationally very expensive,
only a few small patches of 5×5 pixels highlighted in Fig. 2
were selected for the inversion. To reduce the probability of
falling in the local minima, we ran the inversion ten times
for the third cycle, slightly modifying the outputs in each
run.

5. Results

5.1. Temporal evolution of Stokes proﬁles

Figure 4 shows the temporal evolution of Stokes proﬁles
near the ﬂare ribbon position indicated in Fig. 2. The ob-
served Stokes proﬁles are complex in nature. For instance,
the Stokes I proﬁles of Ca ii lines are broad, asymmetric,
and have a single emission peak around the ﬂare peak time.
They show an increase in the intensity as the ﬂare starts,
become the strongest near the ﬂare peak time, and decrease
gradually during the decay phase of the ﬂare. For example,
the intensity proﬁle of a pixel located at the ﬂare footpoint
shows an increase by a factor of ∼ 8 (4) relative to the same
pre-ﬂare pixel in the Ca ii K (Ca ii 8542) intensity at the
ﬂare peak time.

In contrast to the Ca ii 8542 Å line, the Ca ii K line
shows a fast response to change in the intensity proﬁles.
This can be related to the Ca ii K line formation height,
which forms relatively higher in the atmosphere compared
to the Ca ii 8542 Å line (Bjørgen et al. 2019). The intensity
enhancement in the line core of Ca ii 8542 has also been
reported in ﬂare observations by diﬀerent authors (Kleint
2012; Kuridze et al. 2018). Around the ﬂare peak time the
intensity proﬁle in both Ca ii lines shows drastic change
and becomes more asymmetric relative to the start and end
times of the ﬂare. Unlike what we observed in the chromo-
spheric spectral lines, no signiﬁcant intensity enhancement
is observed in the photospheric Fe i 6173 Å line, as displayed
in Fig. 4, which could be due to the lesser inﬂuence of the
C-class ﬂare.

The temporal evolution of the Stokes V proﬁles at the

the ﬂare ribbons is the same at the two corresponding depth
ranges mapped by the spectral lines, as expected. However,
we observe the reversal in the chromospheric Stokes V pro-
ﬁles. This change is induced by a change in the gradient of
the source function as a function of depth, which makes the
core of Stokes I appear in emission and causes a reversal in
the polarity in the Stokes V proﬁles. This behavior is also

present in umbral ﬂashes (e.g., de la Cruz Rodríguez et al.
2013).

Similar reversal proﬁles were also reported by Kleint
(2012) in a C-class ﬂare. It is clear from Fig. 4 that there
is an enhancement in the chromospheric Stokes V signal
around the ﬂare peak time, and after the ﬂare the sig-
nal in Stokes V decreases. Moreover, highly asymmetric
Stokes I and V proﬁles indicate the presence of a strong

gradient in the LOS velocity. Noticeably, during the ﬂare
the proﬁles exhibit changes on a timescale of a few seconds,
which is also noticed in ﬂare simulations (Cheung et al.
2019; Graham et al. 2020).

In our observations the acquisition time needed to scan
the Ca ii K line is ∼ 15 s, which implies that part of the
asymmetric shape of the proﬁles could be due to the unre-
solved fast temporal changes of the proﬁles. The asymme-
try in the proﬁles can also be introduced by the presence
of multi-components of model parameters, which can ap-
pear in dynamic features such as a ﬂare. Even though the
changes in the proﬁles of the Ca ii 8542 Å and Ca ii K lines
are similar for most of the pixels, they are not exactly co-
temporal. The CRISP and CHROMIS instruments recorded
data quasi-simultaneously but not at the exact same time.
This diﬀerence can also alter the inference of the model pa-
rameters obtained from the inversion code; this is an instru-
mental limitation inherent to imaging spectropolarimetry.

5.2. Magnetic ﬁeld and ﬂux in the photosphere and

chromosphere

In this section we present the temporal evolution of the
magnetic ﬁeld parameters inferred in the photosphere and
in the chromosphere during the ﬂare. As the linear polar-
ization signal in the Ca ii 8542 Å line is not suﬃciently high
to infer the magnetic vector in the chromosphere, we only
analyzed the BLOS in the chromosphere and photosphere,
which was estimated using the SPIN code and the WFA,
as discussed in Sect. 4.

The top panels of Fig. 5 display the BLOS maps during
the ﬂare peak time in the photosphere and in the chromo-
sphere. They show that the chromospheric BLOS decreases
and becomes smoother compared to the photospheric BLOS.
During the ﬂare, the longitudinal and transverse magnetic
ﬁelds in the photosphere and in the chromosphere exhibit
changes, mainly near the location of the polarity inversion
line (PIL) and the ﬂare ribbons (Petrie & Sudol 2010; Kleint
2017; Castellanos Durán et al. 2018). Therefore, for further
analysis we selected a region, highlighted in green in the
top panel of Fig. 5, that encompasses both the polarity in-
version line and ﬂare ribbons.

In the photosphere, we found that the mean longitudi-
nal and transverse magnetic ﬂuxes, within the green box,
changed at 08:53 UT, 6 minutes after the ﬂare peak. It
is not clear whether this change is due to the ﬂare or to
the emergence of ﬂux in the selected region. More quan-
titatively, the longitudinal and transverse magnetic ﬂuxes
show relative changes of ∼ 22% and 10%, respectively. Sim-
ilarly, in the chromosphere, changes in the longitudinal and
transverse magnetic ﬂuxes during the ﬂaring time are also
visible (see the second row of Fig. 5). The changes started
around 08:40 UT, and the initial conﬁguration was partially
and gradually restored after the ﬂare. The estimated max-
imum relative changes before and after the ﬂare in the lon-
gitudinal and transverse magnetic ﬂuxes were ∼ 26% and
∼ 6%, respectively. These changes were signiﬁcant during
the ﬂaring time, which could be related to the ﬂare as it
can change the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration in the upper
solar atmosphere.

The mean photospheric LOS magnetic ﬁeld in the se-
lected region exhibited negligible changes before and after
the ﬂare, as displayed in the third row of Fig. 5. However,
in the chromosphere, they showed abrupt changes during

the ﬂaring time. Around the ﬂare start time, the BLOS in
the chromosphere increased slowly, and after the ﬂare it
decreased gradually to ∼300 G.

We also analyzed the change in BLOS in the selected
region, pixel by pixel, in the photosphere and the chro-
mosphere. However, we did not notice a step-wise change
in BLOS, as reported by diﬀerent authors, neither in the
photosphere (Castellanos Durán et al. 2018; Petrie & Su-
dol 2010), nor in the chromosphere (Kleint 2017). Such a
diﬀerent behavior could be attributed to the less intense
C-class fare. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with
Castellanos Durán et al. (2018), who reported that ﬂares
larger than the M1.6-class typically show step-wise changes
in the photosphere. Furthermore, in their investigation, the
smallest ﬂare displaying changes in BLOS was a C3-class
ﬂare, which is comparatively stronger than the ﬂare ana-
lyzed in the present study.

The histograms in the bottom panels of Fig. 5 display
the diﬀerence between the BLOS at the ﬂare peak and at
the no-ﬂare times in the photosphere and in the chromo-
sphere, determined from the pixels located in the green box.
It shows that the chromospheric BLOS changes by up to
∼ 400 G (median ∼ 103 G), whereas the corresponding
photospheric change stays below 200 G (median ∼ 65 G).
Similar strong changes in the chromosphere were also re-
ported by Kleint (2017), but for an X1-class ﬂare.

5.3. Inversion of the ﬂare footpoints

The physical parameters, such as temperature, magnetic
ﬁeld, LOS velocity, and microturbulent velocity, were in-
ferred by inverting three lines (Fe i 6173 Å, Ca ii K, and
Ca ii 8542 Å) simultaneously. For this purpose, we employed
the STiC code (see Sect. 4.2). The stratiﬁcation of the phys-
ical parameters were obtained as a function of the logarithm
of the optical depth scale at 500 nm (log τ500). The photo-
spheric parameters were inferred from the Fe i 6173 Å line,
whereas the lower and the middle chromospheric parame-
ters were derived using the Ca ii K and the Ca ii 8542 Å
lines. We calculated the sensitivity of the lines and found
that the Ca ii K and Ca ii 8542 Å lines are less sensitive be-
low the log τ500 ∼ −5 (see Sect. 5.5). Below that layer, un-
certainties are thus expected to grow. Therefore, in this pa-
per, we discuss the inferred parameters below log τ500 ∼ −5
only.

Figures 6–8 show some examples of observed and best-
ﬁt proﬁles for the selected pixels. They are displayed at dif-
ferent time steps of the ﬂare, that is, near the start (red),
peak (blue), and end (green) times. For comparison, we
also show the inversion of Stokes proﬁles obtained ∼8 min-
utes after the ﬂare end time (indicated with orange). The
code clearly fails to ﬁt the Stokes Q and U proﬁles in the
Ca ii 8542 Å line because of signals below the noise level.
However, a reasonably good ﬁt is achieved for the Stokes I
and V proﬁles.

The stratiﬁcation of the inferred temperature, LOS ve-
locity, microturbulent velocity, longitudinal and transverse
magnetic ﬁelds, and azimuth angles is also shown with the
same color coding in the bottom rows of Figs. 6–8. The
inferred temperatures show that the atmosphere is heated
up to ∼7.5 kK between log τ500 ∼ −4 and log τ500 ∼ −2.5
around the ﬂare peak time. Near the ﬂare peak time, the
retrieved LOS velocity displays a combination of upﬂows
(redshifts; between log τ500 ∼ −4 and log τ500 ∼ −3) and
downﬂows (blueshifts; beyond log τ500 ∼ −4) in the strat-
iﬁed atmosphere. The uncertainties of the parameters, in-
dicated by vertical bars at selected node positions, were
evaluated using Eq. (11.30) from del Toro Iniesta (2003),
which takes into account both the discrepancy between the
observed and the modeled proﬁles and the eﬀective sensitiv-
ity of the spectral lines to the underlying parameters. Due
to weak Stokes Q and U signals in Ca ii 8542 Å, the un-
certainty in the inferred azimuth and transverse magnetic
ﬁelds is higher in the chromospheric layers.

In addition to this, we also inverted the pixels located
on the dashed line highlighted in Fig. 2. The stratiﬁca-
tions of inferred parameters, such as temperature, LOS
velocity, magnetic ﬁeld, and microturbulent velocity, are
shown in Fig. 9; they are evaluated at the ﬂare peak time
(∼08:46 UT) and the no-ﬂare time (∼09:30 UT). The ap-

pearance of two opposite-polarity footpoints lying on the se-
lected line is visible on the magnetic ﬁeld map. The top pan-
els of Fig. 9 clearly demonstrate the heating of the deeper
layers, mainly at the ﬂare footpoints locations. Moreover,
the presence of chromospheric evaporation (upﬂows of hot
plasma) and condensation (downﬂows of cooler plasma)
near the footpoints are also remarkably visible. Further-
more, we ﬁnd that the microturbulent velocity, which pro-
vides information about the unresolved and nonthermal
component of the plasma velocity, is below 10 km s−1 in the
ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring atmosphere. However, it is slightly
higher in the ﬂaring atmosphere. In the following section
we further discuss the temporal evolution of the inferred
parameters.

5.4. Temporal evolution of the inferred parameters

Figure 10 shows the temporal evolution of the parameters
obtained from the inversion of Stokes proﬁles using the
STiC code. At each timestep we obtained the mean value
of the parameters for the selected pixels (5×5) marked in
Fig. 2. For the sake of clarity and to enable comparison,
we split the solar atmosphere into three regions based on
the optical depth. The photospheric parameters were deter-
mined around the log τ500 ∼ −1, whereas the mean values
of the chromospheric parameters were evaluated between
log τ500 ∼ −2.5 and −3.5 for the lower chromosphere, and

between log τ500 ∼ −3.5 and −5 for the middle-to-upper

At the beginning of the ﬂare, the inferred temperature
increases in the upper chromosphere and then decreases
gradually after the ﬂare end time. This is shown in the ﬁrst
column of Fig. 10. The mean value of the temperature in-
creases from ∼ 5 kK up to ∼ 11 kK at the footpoint in the

upper chromosphere, whereas in the lower chromosphere
it changes from ∼ 5 kK to ∼ 7 kK. The temporal evolu-
tion analysis suggests that the ﬂare heats the deeper layers
(lower chromosphere) during its peak time, which is also
evident in the top panels of Fig. 9. Furthermore, the tem-
perature in the lower chromosphere decreases to ∼ 5 kK
just after the end time of the ﬂare. However, in the upper
chromosphere it decays more slowly when compared to the
deeper layers. Our analysis suggests that the most inten-
sively heated layer in the ﬂaring atmosphere is the upper
chromosphere, between ∼ 7.5 kK and ∼ 11 kK. In contrast
to the chromosphere, we do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant change
in the photospheric temperature, as depicted by the blue
curve in Fig. 10.

The temporal evolution of the LOS velocity for the se-
lected pixels is shown in the second column of Fig. 10. The
layers between log τ500 ∼ −2.5 and −3.5 exhibit down-
ﬂows during the ﬂaring time, with a maximum speed of
∼ 12 km s−1. In contrast, the middle-to-upper chromo-
sphere (log τ500 ∼ −3.5 to −5) shows upﬂows during the
peak time near the ﬂare footpoints, with a maximum value
of ∼ −7 km s−1. We notice that the upper chromosphere
is dominated by upﬂows (evaporation) and the lower chro-
mosphere by downﬂows (condensation), mainly at the ﬂare
footpoints. This is also illustrated in Fig. 9, which shows
the stratiﬁcation of velocity at the ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring
times. Our results are compatible with those reported by
Falchi & Mauas (2002), who also highlighted the presence of

upﬂows and downﬂows in a ﬂaring loop, but using the Hδ,
Ca ii K, and Si i 3905 Å spectral lines. In contrast, Kuridze
et al. (2017) found weak downﬂows at an optical depth be-
tween log τ500 ∼ −1 and ∼ −5.5, a discrepancy that could
be attributed to observations of their C-class ﬂare in its late
phase and to the rather limited sensitivity of their observa-
tions in the Ca ii 8542 Å line to the photospheric velocities.
In the photosphere, we do not notice a signiﬁcant change in
the LOS velocity, which is in agreement with various studies
(Falchi & Mauas 2002; Kuridze et al. 2017, 2018).

The temporal evolution of the LOS magnetic ﬁeld ob-
tained from the inversions is shown in the third column
of Fig. 10. In our analysis we do not ﬁnd permanent or
step-wise change in BLOS from pixel to pixel. However, the
inferred BLOS in the lower and upper chromospheres dis-
plays changes during the ﬂaring time at the ﬂare footpoints
located at opposite polarities. As depicted in Fig. 10 for
the pixels located on the negative polarity footpoint, the
change begins ∼ 4 minutes after the ﬂare start time, in-
creases until the ﬂare peak time from ∼150 G to ∼800 G,
and then decreases again to near the pre-ﬂare BLOS value
(∼ 150 G) for both the upper and lower chromospheres.
We also notice similar BLOS changes in the positive polar-
ity footpoint pixel, which exhibits a change from ∼500 G
to ∼1000 G. In the chromosphere, we do not notice any
signiﬁcant change in the horizontal component of the mag-
netic ﬁeld (shown in the fourth column of Fig. 10), which
could be due to noisy Stokes Q and U signals. We note
that the inferred horizontal magnetic ﬁeld B⊥ and azimuth
angles show more uncertainties in the chromosphere due to
weak signals in the Stokes Q and U signals. In contrast to
the chromospheric LOS magnetic ﬁeld, we do not notice
any signiﬁcant changes in the photospheric LOS magnetic
ﬁeld. Noticeably, in the photosphere, the pixels located near
the footpoint of positive polarity exhibit a small change of
∼200 G in the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld strength, whereas

Article number, page 10 of 14

the pixels located near a negative polarity footpoint exhibit
a small linear increase after the peak time.

The obtained microturbulent velocity is also shown in
the ﬁfth column of Fig. 10. It illustrates that the Vturb
value is variable throughout the ﬂaring atmosphere in the
chromosphere, whereas in the photosphere it remains below
∼ 2.5 km s−1. We notice a signiﬁcant rise in the Vturb value
near the ﬂare start time. During the ﬂaring time the value
is between ∼ 2.5 km s−1 and ∼ 7.5 km s−1.

5.5. Sensitivity of the spectral lines

In this section we discuss how diﬀerent lines (Ca ii K,
Ca ii 8542 Å, and Fe i 6173 Å) are sensitive to the ﬂar-
ing atmosphere. Response functions (RFs) provide valuable
information about how the Stokes proﬁles respond to per-
turbations in the physical parameters of the model atmo-
sphere, such as temperature, magnetic ﬁeld, LOS velocity,
etc. (Beckers & Milkey 1975; del Toro Iniesta 2003). Addi-
tionally, they are also used to compute the uncertainty in
the inferred physical parameters.

We evaluated the RFs for the pixels located on the
dashed line shown in Fig. 2, covering the ﬂare footpoints
and the PIL region. The stratiﬁcation of inferred param-
eters along this line are also shown in Fig. 9. In order
to compare the ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring atmospheres, the
physical parameters were evaluated at the ﬂare peak time
(∼ 08:46 UT) and at a later (no-ﬂare) time (∼ 09:30 UT).
As an example, the RFs of the Stokes proﬁles to the
physical parameters as a function of wavelength for a ﬂar-
ing pixel and a non-ﬂaring pixel are shown in the top and
middle panels of Fig. 11, while the bottom panels display
the mean RFs around the line core along the dashed line
highlighted in Fig. 2. We took the LOS velocity variation
into account while evaluating the mean RFs around the line
core.

Fig. 11. Response functions of the Stokes proﬁles at the ﬂare and no-ﬂare time. Top and middle rows: Response functions of the
Stokes proﬁles to temperature, velocity, and LOS magnetic ﬁeld as a function of wavelength, obtained during the no-ﬂare time
(top panel) and the ﬂare peak time (middle panel). Bottom panels: Mean RFs around the line core for the pixels located on the
dashed line at the ﬂare time (right) and the no-ﬂare time (left). The dotted black lines refer to the maximum RF values.

As depicted in Fig. 11, the RFs of Stokes I to the tem-
perature, for the Ca ii K and 8542 Å lines, exhibit sensitiv-
ity between log τ500 ∼ −1 and −5 for both the non-ﬂaring
and ﬂaring pixels. However, the sensitivity around the ﬂare
peak time moves toward the deeper layers. We note that
the transition region in the reconstructed models moves
accordingly to deeper layers as well, which is compatible
with results from numerical radiative hydrodynamic sim-
ulations (e.g., Kerr et al. 2016). Furthermore, the RFs of
Stokes I to LOS velocity show maximum sensitivity around
log τ500 ∼ −4 for a non-ﬂaring pixel, whereas for the ﬂar-
ing pixels it becomes sensitive to deeper layers, down to
log τ500 ∼ −2.5. The RFs of Stokes V to the LOS magnetic
ﬁeld for the Ca ii 8542 Å line show more sensitivity in the
deeper layers (log τ500 ∼ −2.5 to −4) in the ﬂaring pixels
compared to the non-ﬂaring pixels, which are mainly only
sensitive around log τ500 ∼ −4.

It is clear from the obtained mean RFs of Stokes pro-
ﬁles to the temperature, shown in the bottom panels of
Fig. 11, that in the ﬂaring atmosphere the Ca ii K and
Ca ii 8542 Å lines show more sensitivity in the deeper lay-
ers of the atmosphere, mainly at the footpoints locations
(∼6(cid:48)(cid:48)and ∼17(cid:48)(cid:48)). This suggests that even a C-class ﬂare can
heat the middle-to-lower chromosphere similarly to the in-
tense M- and X-class ﬂares. It also provides conﬁdence in
the reliability of the inferred physical parameters in the

deeper layers of the atmosphere. Similar to the tempera-
ture, we also notice changes in LOS velocity and magnetic
ﬁeld, mainly at the locations of the ﬂare footpoints. Fur-
thermore, the response of the Stokes V proﬁles to the LOS
magnetic ﬁeld also moves toward deeper layers during the
ﬂaring time compared to the non-ﬂaring time.

In contrast to the Ca ii lines, we do not notice signiﬁcant
change in the RFs for the Fe i 6173 Å line between the
ﬂaring and the non-ﬂaring pixels, which implies that the
photosphere is not aﬀected by our C-class ﬂare.

6. Discussion

In this study, we have analyzed a C2-class solar ﬂare
(SOL2019-05-06T08:47) that occurred on May 6, 2019, in
NOAA AR 12740. The ﬂare was observed simultaneously
in the Ca ii K, Ca ii 8542 Å, and Fe i 6173 Å lines with
the CRISP and CHROMIS instruments at the SST. We
performed full Stokes imaging spectropolarimetric observa-
tions in the Ca ii 8542 Å and Fe i 6173 Å lines, whereas
we observed only Stokes I in the Ca ii K spectral line. Our
observations cover the rise, peak, and decay phases of the
ﬂare. All observed lines were analyzed simultaneously in
order to understand the stratiﬁcation of the physical pa-
rameters, mainly at the ﬂare footpoints, in the ﬂaring and

a few selected pixels, mainly located at the ﬂare footpoints
and at the PIL. The temporal analysis of the ﬂare foot-
points shows that the upper chromosphere (log τ500 ∼ −3.5
and −5) is heated between ∼ 7.5 kK and ∼ 11 kK, whereas
the lower chromosphere (log τ500 ∼ −2.5 to −3.5) is heated
up to 7 kK.

In the photosphere (i.e., below log τ500 ∼ −2) we do not
notice any signiﬁcant change during the ﬂare and non-ﬂare
times. The obtained temperature stratiﬁcation during a C2-
class ﬂare is consistent with Kuridze et al. (2018); however,
they reported a higher temperature value up to ∼ 13 kK,
which could be due to the stronger intensity of the M1.9-
class ﬂare. Moreover, and in contrast with the present study,
Kuridze et al. (2017) reported higher temperature values
ranging between ∼6.5 kK and ∼20 kK in the middle and
upper chromospheres (log τ500 ∼ −3.5 to −5.5) for a C8.4-
class ﬂare. Normally, at such high temperatures, the Ca ii
is completely ionized, leaving higher-order ionized atoms.
This overestimated temperature value could be attributed
to the lack of sensitivity ensuing from the inversion of a sin-
gle spectral line (Ca ii 8542 Å) or to the interpolation ap-
proach between the selected nodes for temperature, which
could lead to an extrapolation of the temperature gradient
from the lower chromosphere into the higher layers where
the line is no longer sensitive (e.g., da Silva Santos et al.
2018).

The obtained LOS velocity has revealed a combination
of upﬂows and downﬂows during the ﬂaring time at the
ﬂare footpoint locations, which are the signatures of the
chromospheric condensation and evaporation. We ﬁnd that
the lower chromosphere (log τ500 ∼ −2.5 to −3.5) exhibits
downﬂows, with a maximum value of ∼ 12 km s−1, whereas
the upper-to-middle chromosphere (log τ500 ∼ −3.5 to
−5.5) hosts upﬂows of 7 km s−1. In addition to ﬂare ob-
servations (e.g., Falchi & Mauas 2002; Berlicki et al. 2008;
Libbrecht et al. 2019), radiation hydrodynamics simulations
(e.g., Kerr et al. 2016; Graham et al. 2020) and 3D radia-
tive magnetohydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Cheung et al.
2019) of solar ﬂares also report similar scenarios of upﬂows
and downﬂows.

The temporal analysis of the LOS magnetic ﬁeld in-
ferred from the STiC inversion code at the footpoints
exhibits changes during the ﬂaring time. Both opposite-
polarity footpoints display an increase in the magnetic ﬁeld
strength at the ﬂare peak time. The retrieved maximum
change at the footpoints is around 650 G.

To investigate the sensitivity of the observed lines in the
ﬂaring atmosphere, we analyzed the RFs computed for the
model atmosphere obtained from the STiC inversion code.
To facilitate the comparison, the numerical RFs were com-
puted at the ﬂare peak time (∼08:46 UT) and after the
ﬂare ended (∼09:30 UT) across a line passing through the
ﬂare footpoints and the PIL. The analysis of average RFs to
temperature near the line core of the Ca ii and Fe i 6173 Å
lines in the ﬂaring atmosphere shows that the Ca ii lines
are more sensitive in the deeper layers (log τ500 ∼ −2.5 to
−4) compared to the non-ﬂaring atmosphere, where they
are mainly sensitive around log τ500 ∼ −4. Similar to the
temperature, the deeper layers are more sensitive to the
LOS velocity and LOS magnetic ﬁeld, which is in agree-
ment with Kuridze et al. (2018). In the photosphere, below
log τ500 ∼ −2.5, we do not notice a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the ﬂaring and non-ﬂaring atmospheres.

in the chromosphere explaining our observations is depicted. The
observed chromospheric condensation and evaporation near the
ﬂare footpoints are indicated by red and blue arrows, respec-
tively. The dashed black line and the solid black line refer to the

and ﬂare peak times, respectively.

non-ﬂaring atmospheres. In the following, we summarize
our results.

The temporal evolution clearly shows the presence of
intense brightening near the ﬂare footpoints. At these lo-
cations the observed Stokes I proﬁles of Ca ii K and
Ca ii 8542 Å are broad, asymmetric, and show strong emis-
sion peaks during the ﬂaring time. Our analysis suggests
that the asymmetries in the Ca ii lines are due to the pres-
ence of strong gradients in the LOS velocity. It is known
that ﬂares mainly heat the chromosphere at the ﬂare foot-
points, which can produce a reversal in the gradient of the
source function, leading to an increase in the line core emis-
sion relative to the far wings. As a result, strong emission
proﬁles in the chromospheric lines are expected, and are
indeed present in our observations.

The temporal analysis of the LOS magnetic ﬂux near
the PIL and the ﬂare footpoints reveals that both the longi-
tudinal and the transverse magnetic ﬂuxes exhibit changes
during the ﬂare in the photosphere as well as in the chro-
mosphere. These chromospheric changes are correlated with
the GOES X-ray curve, which suggests that reconﬁguration
of the magnetic ﬁeld takes place in the upper atmosphere.
In contrast to previous studies (Petrie & Sudol 2010; Kleint
2017; Castellanos Durán et al. 2018), we do not ﬁnd any
step-wise-like change in the pixels located near the ﬂare
footpoints and the PIL. This could be attributed to a less in-
tense C-class ﬂare. Noticeably, we ﬁnd more abrupt changes
in the LOS magnetic ﬁeld in the chromosphere as compared
to the photosphere around the ﬂare peak time.

In order to analyze the stratiﬁcation of the ﬂaring atmo-
spheres, we employed the non-LTE multiline inversion code
STiC. We investigated the temperature, the LOS magnetic
ﬁeld, the LOS velocity, and the microturbulent velocity for

Our RF analysis suggests that a fraction of the appar-
ent increase in the LOS magnetic ﬁeld, mainly at the foot-
points, may be due to the increase in the sensitivity of the
Ca ii 8542 Å line in the deeper layers, where the ﬁeld is rel-
atively strong compared to the upper layers. The rest may
be due to the reconﬁguration of magnetic ﬁeld lines during
the ﬂare.

Various models have been proposed to understand a
solar ﬂare (see Shibata & Magara 2011, and references
therein). In the standard ﬂare model, commonly known as
the “CSHKP” model (originally introduced by Carmichael
1964; Sturrock 1966; Hirayama 1974; Kopp & Pneuman
1976), the ﬂare is triggered by the magnetic reconnection
or reconﬁgurations of the magnetic ﬁeld lines in the corona.
During magnetic reconnection processes, the magnetic en-
ergy is converted into thermal and kinetic energy, resulting
in plasma heating, particle acceleration, and a release of
energy in the entire electromagnetic spectrum. A beam of
energetic particles is accelerated to the deeper layers of the
solar atmosphere, where they deposit most of their energy
and momentum. The interaction with the dense chromo-
spheric plasma gives rise to heating and the production of
hard X-ray and soft X-ray emissions. At the ﬂare footpoints
the hot plasma rises (evaporation) and the cool plasma
sinks (condensation) toward the lower atmosphere along
the ﬂare loops.

Unfortunately, due to the unavailability of X-ray ob-
servations, we cannot provide evidence of hard X-rays at
the ﬂare footpoints. However, recent X-ray observations of
ﬂares have demonstrated that, normally, hard X-rays are
emitted near the ﬂare footpoints (Fletcher & Hudson 2002;
Battaglia & Kontar 2011; Battaglia et al. 2015). In line
with the standard ﬂare model, the presence of both chro-
mospheric evaporation and condensation at the ﬂare foot-
points is clearly noticed in our observations. In order to
present a possible scenario of the ﬂare, we sketch the mag-
netic ﬁeld conﬁguration and the observed features together
with the standard ﬂare model in Fig. 12. This sketch illus-
trates the simplest picture of the ﬂare by considering the
standard ﬂare model in 2D and the results of this study. It
depicts the appearance of chromospheric evaporation and
condensation at the ﬂare footpoints and the mean RFs of
the chromospheric lines to the temperature for the ﬂaring
and non-ﬂaring atmospheres.

7. Conclusions
In the present paper we have reconstructed the stratiﬁca-
tion of ﬂaring atmospheres as a function of time using a
multiline full-Stokes inversion approach. Our main results
can be summarized as follows.
– In the footpoints we reconstruct the simultaneous pres-
ence of chromospheric condensation and evaporation. At
that location the temperature rises up to approximately
11 kK.

– The sensitivity of the Ca ii lines analyzed in this study
shifts to a larger optical depth in the footpoints and
their surroundings. However, the Fe i 6173 Å line shows
insigniﬁcant changes during the ﬂare.

– Our time evolution analysis yields changes in the mag-
netic ﬁeld stratiﬁcation, mostly above the photosphere,
but those changes are not step-wise, contrary to what
was reported in previous studies involving more intense
ﬂaring conditions.

It has been speculated that the magnetic ﬁeld lines re-
conﬁgure in the upper layers during a ﬂare. The direct sig-
natures of magnetic ﬁeld changes derived from ﬂare obser-
vations are very limited. Thus, to further investigate this
hypothesis, we need simultaneous photospheric and chro-
mospheric polarimetry with suﬃciently strong linear polar-
ization signals, which can be achieved with state-of-the-
art instruments and the advent of new generation solar
telescopes, such as the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope
(DKIST; Tritschler et al. 2015) and the European Solar
Telescope (EST; Matthews et al. 2016). Our future work
will focus on the analysis of multiline polarimetric observa-
tions to understand the changes in the magnetic ﬁeld vector
during a ﬂare.
