Abstract 
When performing statistical analysis of single-subject fMRI data, serial 
correlations need to be taken into account to allow for valid inference. 
Otherwise, the variability in the parameter estimates might be under-
estimated  resulting 
false-positive  rates.  Serial 
correlations in fMRI data are commonly characterized in terms of a 
first-order  autoregressive  (AR)  process  and  then  removed  via  pre-
whitening. The required noise model for the pre-whitening depends 
on a number of parameters, particularly the repetition time (TR). Here 
we investigate how the sub-second temporal resolution provided by 
simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging changes the noise structure in 
fMRI time series. We fit a higher-order AR model and then estimate 
the  optimal  AR  model  order  for  a  sequence  with  a  TR  of  less  than 
600 ms providing whole brain coverage. We show that physiological 
noise  modelling  successfully  reduces  the  required  AR  model  order, 
but  remaining  serial  correlations  necessitate  an  advanced  noise 
model.  We conclude  that commonly  used  noise models, such  as  the 
AR(1) model, are inadequate for modelling serial correlations in fMRI 
using  sub-second  TRs.  Rather,  physiological  noise  modelling  in 
combination  with  advanced  pre-whitening  schemes  enable  valid 
inference in single-subject analysis using fast fMRI sequences.

Introduction

dependent (BOLD)-weighted images are acquired in 
a  rapid,  successive  fashion  depicting  changes  in 
deoxyhemoglobin  content  in  the  brain  over  time 
(Bandettini et al., 1992; Kwong et al., 1992; Ogawa et 
al., 1992). The signal of interest is the time series in 
each  voxel  comprising  the 
local  hemodynamic 
response  (Boynton et al., 1996; Buxton et al.,  1998; 
Fox et al., 1988). A statistical model is then applied to 
draw an inference about the effect of an experimental 
manipulation  and  its  significance.  In  this  process, 
serial  correlations,  i.e.  correlations  between  the 
errors  of  successive  samples,  need  to  be  taken  into 
account for valid inference. 

Statistical  analysis  of  fMRI  time  series  is  often 
performed  using  a  mass-univariate  general  linear 
model  to  assess  the  effect  of  a  task  in  each  voxel 
(Friston et al., 1994). The basic model at each voxel 
reads  𝑌 = 𝑋𝑤 + 𝑒;  where  𝑌  are  the  observations 
(data),  𝑋  is  the  design  matrix  containing  the 
explanatory  variables,  𝑤  are 
the  (unknown) 
parameters on which the inference is based and 𝑒 is 
the  error  following  a  normal  distribution  with 
𝑒~𝑁(0, 𝜎2𝑉)  (Kiebel  and  Holmes,  2007).  Here,  𝑉 
describes  the  serial  correlations  over  time.  When 
performing  a  statistical 
this  correlation 
structure needs to be taken into account to obtain the 
desired  false-positive  rate,  such  that  the  estimated 
variance of 𝑤̂ is not biased, and too liberal thresholds 
are  prevented  (Purdon  and  Weisskoff,  1998; 
Woolrich  et  al.,  2001;  Worsley  et  al.,  2002).

whitening1 is traditionally performed to remove the 
serial  correlations  from  the  data  and  the  model

1Pre-whitening  relies  on  accurate  knowledge  of  the  error  covariance 
matrix  𝑉,  which  depends  on  a  number  of  (scan)  parameters  and  is 
therefore  usually  estimated  from  the  data  itself.  The  error  covariance 
matrix  contains  the  variance  of  the  error  signal  with  itself  shifted  by 
increasing time lag 𝜏 (Friston et al., 1994). The parameter estimation is 
performed  in  two  steps.  First,  the  residuals  𝑟 = 𝑌 − 𝑋𝑤̂  are  estimated 
using  ordinary  least  squares,  i.e.  the  pseudoinverse  𝑋−  of  the  design 
matrix is used to estimate 𝑤̂ = 𝑋−𝑌. The covariance matrix 𝑉 can then be 
estimated from the residuals, choosing between several parametric and 
non-parametric  methods  (Woolrich  et  al.,  2001)  with  negligible  bias

order 1 has been a successful strategy to improve the 
validity of drawn inferences for fMRI time series with 
a repetition time (TR) above 2 seconds (Lund et al., 
2006).  Similarly,  Worsley  et  al.  (2002)  found  an 
AR(1) to be adequate for most voxels. However, it has 
been  hypothesized  that  a  higher  AR  model  order 
might  be  required 
to  reliably  capture  serial 
correlations for data sets with considerably shorter 
TRs (Lund et al., 2006). Given the recent acceleration 
of 
employing 
imaging 
simultaneous multislice (SMS) techniques (Breuer et 
al.,  2005;  Larkman  et  al.,  2001;  Setsompop  et  al., 
2012) - for a recent review see Barth et al. (2016) - 
one  can  now  easily  achieve  sub-second  temporal 
resolution for whole-brain acquisitions (Feinberg et 
al., 2010; Moeller et al., 2010). Hence, it is becoming 
increasingly important to address the effect of short 
TRs  in  fMRI  analyses.  Increased  false-positive  rates 
were observed empirically in resting-state data with 
a  TR  of  1 second  but  without  physiological  noise 
modelling (Eklund et al., 2012). Similarly, when using 
higher  AR-model  orders  for  pre-whitening  in  an 
event-related paradigm, a reduction in t-values was 
found for sequences with TRs below 2 seconds (Sahib 
et  al.,  2016).  However,  the  underlying  mechanisms 
and sources of serial correlations remain unknown. 
Therefore, we investigate serial correlations in fMRI 
time series with sub-second TR achieved using SMS 
EPI  to  assess  changes  in  the  noise  correlation 
structure that need to be taken into account for valid 
inference. 

We characterize serial correlations in terms of an AR 
process,  and  use  the  Variational  Bayesian  (VB) 
framework for fMRI time series (Penny et al., 2003) 
to estimate the optimal AR model order required for 
a  short-TR  sequence.  VB  implements  Bayesian 
statistics  for  neuroimaging  and  offers  a  framework 
for parameter estimation complementary to classical 
statistics  (Friston  et  al.,  2002).  Pertinent  to  the 
present  study,  the  classical  general  linear  model  is 
extended  by  introducing  an  AR  noise  process  of 
arbitrary  order  𝑝.  Instead  of  computing  a  pre-
whitening  matrix,  serial  correlations  are  explicitly 
modelled  and 
the  parameter

covariance matrix 𝑉(𝜆) is the same in all voxels and only the variance 𝜎2 
differs between voxels, i.e. the pattern of serial correlations is the same in 
all  voxels,  but  its  amplitude  is  different  at  each  voxel.  This  allows  the 
pooling  across  voxels  to  give  a  highly  precise  estimate,  and  the  error 
covariance matrix is then treated as a known quantity in the subsequent 
inference (Glaser and Friston, 2007). Since ReML requires a linear model 
for  𝑉,  a  first-order  linear  approximation  of  an  autoregressive  (AR) 
process  of  order  1  around  the  expansion  point  of  𝑎1 = 0.2  is  used  to 
model  the  error  covariance.  Second,  𝑉  is  then  used  to  form  the  pre-
whitening  matrix  𝑀 = 𝑉−1
2⁄   giving  𝑀𝑌 = 𝑀𝑋𝑤  + 𝑧  with  𝑧~𝑁(0, 𝜎2𝐼) 
and 𝑧 = 𝑀𝑒. This model now conforms to the sphericity assumption and 
the degrees of freedom revert to their classical values. 

 
                                                             
𝑌 = 𝑋𝑊 + 𝐸, where 𝑌 is the [𝑇 × 𝑁] data matrix, 𝑋 is 
the [𝑇 × 𝐾] design matrix, 𝑊 is a [𝐾 × 𝑁]  matrix of 
regression  coefficients  and  𝐸  is  the  [𝑇 × 𝑁]  error 
matrix  for  𝑁  voxels  at  𝑇  points  in  time  using  𝐾 
regressors  (Penny  et  al.,  2007,  2005).  This 
constitutes a spatio-temporal model of the fMRI data 
to directly incorporate dependencies between voxels 
(Penny  et  al.,  2005).  The  autoregressive  process  at 
voxel  𝑛  is  modelled  as  𝑦𝑛 = 𝑋𝑤𝑛 + 𝑒𝑛,  with  𝑒𝑛 =
𝐸̃𝑛𝑎𝑛 + 𝑧𝑛. Here, 𝑒𝑛 models an AR process where 𝑎𝑛 
are the AR coefficients, 𝐸̃𝑛 are the ‘embedded’ errors, 
i.e. the error of 𝑝 previous samples, and 𝑧𝑛 describes 
independent  and  identically  distributed  Gaussian 
errors.  The  priors  over  the  regression  and  AR 
coefficients are used to model spatial dependencies 
across voxels, whereas the posterior factorizes over 
voxels  and  parameter  types  making  the  update 
equations tractable (Penny et al., 2005). Using the VB 
framework,  model  parameters  are  estimated  by 
maximizing  the  free  energy  𝐹,  which  constitutes  a 
lower bound on the model evidence, and can be used 
for Bayesian model selection to obtain the optimal AR 
model  order  (Penny  et  al.,  2003).  Therefore,  VB  is 
well  suited  to  estimate  the  AR  coefficients  and  to 
choose an optimal noise model. 

As  mentioned  previously,  physiological  noise 
modelling  can 
improve  the  validity  of  drawn 
inferences using fMRI data by reducing the required 
AR  model  order  (Lund  et  al.,  2006).  Signal 
fluctuations  related  to  cardiac  and  respiratory 
activity  have  been  identified  as  major  sources  of 
structured noise in fMRI data (Bianciardi et al., 2009; 
Hutton  et  al.,  2011).  Signal  fluctuations  related  to 
respiration  enter  the  fMRI  time  series  signal  either 
through  changes  in  venous  oxygenation  content 
(Windischberger et al., 2002) or through modulation 
of  the  main  magnetic  field  (Van  de  Moortele  et  al., 
2002) and higher image encoding fields (Bollmann et 
al.,  2017;  Vannesjo  et  al.,  2015),  which  induce 
geometric  distortions  across  the  whole  EPI  image. 
Cardiac  activity  induces  high  and  localized  signal 
variability  through  mechanisms  such  as  vessel 
pulsation  (Dagli  et  al.,  1999;  Kasper  et  al.,  2017). 
Physiological signal fluctuations can be modelled as a 
Fourier  expansion  of  the  cardiac  and  respiratory 
phase  utilizing  their  intrinsic  periodicity  (Glover  et 
al.,  2000),  thereby  providing  nuisance  regressors 
which  can  then  be  included  as  covariates  in  the 
statistical  analysis.  Additionally,  significant  signal 
contributions  related  to  changes  in  cardiac  and 
respiratory  rate  have  been  identified  causing  low-
frequency oscillations in fMRI time series (Birn et al., 
2008,  2006;  Chang  et  al.,  2009).  Another  source  of 
unwanted signal fluctuations are movement related 
effects  (Friston  et  al.,  1996).  Changes  in  voxel 
position  alter  the  spin  history,  thereby  inducing 
signal fluctuations which can last for several seconds 

and depend on the voxel position in previous scans. 
Thus,  a  serially  correlated  signal  is  introduced  into 
the  fMRI  time  series.  In  summary,  a  range  of 
physiological processes introduce unwanted, serially 
correlated signals that need to be taken into account 
in  the  modelling  of  fMRI  time  series  data.  Here,  we 
investigate 
impact  of  physiological  noise 
in  addition  to 
modelling  (including  movement 
cardiac  and  respiratory  activity)  on  the  noise 
structure as well as on the optimal AR model order.

Materials and Methods 
Data Acquisition  
MRI data were acquired on a MAGNETOM 7T whole-
(Siemens  Healthcare,  Erlangen, 
body  scanner 
Germany) with a 32-channel head coil (Nova Medical, 
Wilmington,  US).  To  achieve  sufficiently  short  TRs, 
SMS  EPI  (Feinberg  et  al.,  2010;  Setsompop  et  al., 
2012) was utilized to acquire multiple slices at once. 
The  CMRR  SMS 
implementation  (release  11a) 
(https://www.cmrr.umn.edu/multiband/) was used 
and  reconstruction  was  performed  using  the  slice-
GRAPPA  technique  (Setsompop  et  al.,  2012).  FMRI 
data  were  acquired  with  a  short-TR  sequence  to 
investigate  serial  correlations  and  their  interaction 
with physiological noise modelling. The results were 
then compared to those obtained from data acquired 
with a longer, more common TR. Imaging parameters 
for the short-TR sequence were: TR = 589 ms, voxel 
isotropic,  TE  =  23 ms,  SMS-
size  =  2.5 mm 
acceleration-factor  =  4,  GRAPPA-factor  =  2,  FOV  = 
212 mm x 212 mm, number of slices = 48, number of 
scans  =  581.  Imaging  parameters  for  the  long-TR 
sequence  were:  TR  =  1990 ms,  voxel  size  =  1.3 mm 
isotropic,  TE  =  25 ms,  SMS-acceleration-factor  =  3, 
GRAPPA-factor  =  3,  Partial  Fourier  =  7/8,  FOV  = 
212 mm x 212 mm, number of slices = 96, number of 
scans = 188. 

Study Design 
The  project  was  approved  by  the  University  of 
Queensland’s Medical Research Ethics Committee. N 
= 10 healthy, right handed participants with normal 
or  corrected  to  normal  vision  participated  in  the 
study  after  giving  written,  informed  consent.  The 
data  were  acquired  as  part  of  a  larger  study 
comparing different sequence parameter settings for 
fMRI at 7T. For six participants (five female), cardiac 
and  respiratory  data  were  recorded  concurrently 
with the image acquisition using a breathing belt and 
an  ECG system  (Brain  Products,  Gilching,  Germany) 
and their data were analysed here.

with consistent, medium length button presses of the 
index, middle, ring and little fingers of the right hand 
in  sequential  order.  In  the  complex  movement 
condition,  a  visual  stimulus  consisting  of  two  dots 
and  two  dashed  lines,  indicating  short  and  long 
button  presses,  was  presented.  In  each  block,  the 
visual cue (2500 ms duration) followed by a fixation 
cross  (500 ms  duration)  was  shown  six  times, 
resulting  in  an  18 s  block  length.  In  the  complex 
condition,  each  of  the  six  possible  combinations  of 
two  short  and  two  long  button  presses  were 
presented  in  a  randomized  order.  In  the  rest 
condition, only the fixation cross was shown. For two 
participants, the first run of each sequence followed 
the  order  [rest  -  complex  -  simple  -  rest  -  simple  - 
complex  -  repeated],  while  for  the  remaining  four 
participants, the simple condition was presented first 
[rest  -  simple  -  complex  -  rest  -  complex  -  simple  - 
repeated]. In total, one run of the task lasted 342 s, 
containing  6  blocks  of  rest,  simple  and  complex 
movement  and  an  additional  rest  block  at  the  end. 
For  each  sequence  parameter  setting,  two  runs  of 
fMRI data were acquired. For the second run of each 
sequence,  the  order  of  movement  conditions  was 
reversed.

Preprocessing 
Preprocessing  was  performed using  SPM12  (r6224, 
Wellcome  Trust  Centre  for  Neuroimaging,  London, 
UK)  and  Matlab  (R2016a,  The  MathWorks,  Inc., 
Natick,  MA,  US).  For  anatomical  reference,  an  EPI 
image  with  an  isotropic  voxel  size  of  1 mm  was 
chosen.  Upon  visual  inspection,  it  provided  better 
alignment  in  distortion  prone  areas  such  as  frontal 
regions  and  around 
the 
additionally  acquired  T1-weighted  image  following 
the  rationale  in  Grabner  et  al.  (2014).  To  provide a 
robust starting point for the image segmentation, this 
reference image was first coregistered to the MNI305 
T1  template.  Next,  the  image  was  segmented  using 
the unified segmentation algorithm (Ashburner and 
Friston,  2005)  to  retrieve  tissue  probability  maps 
(TPMs) in subject space as well as the deformations 
field  from  and  to  MNI  and  subject  space.  The 
functional  data  were  preprocessed  in  the  following 
way:  Realignment  using  the  two-pass  procedure. 
Coregistration  (including  resampling  using  a  7th 
order  B-spline)  to  the  reference  anatomical  EPI 
image  for  the  first  run,  coregistration  to  the  mean 
image of the first run for the second run to improve 
between-run  alignment.  Last,  smoothing  of  the 
functional  images  was  performed  using  a  Gaussian 
smoothing  kernel  with  5 mm  full-width-at-half-
maximum (FWHM) size. All analyses were performed 
in subject space.

Physiological Noise Modelling 
Peripheral ECG data were preprocessed using an in-
house  implementation  and  the  fieldtrip  toolbox 
(Oostenveld et al., 2011) for data read-in. Following 
the recommendations in Ritter et al. (2007), a simple 
gradient artefact correction was used fitting an offset 
and a moving average template (computed from the 
current,  the  previous  and  following  4  scans), 
followed by low-pass filtering and downsampling to 
100 Hz. Preprocessed cardiac and raw breathing data 
were  used  to  compute  the  Fourier  expansion  of 
cardiac and respiratory phase (Glover et al., 2000) as 
implemented  in  the  physIO  toolbox  (Kasper  et  al., 
2017) with a cardiac model order of 3, a respiratory 
model order of 4, and an interaction model order of 1 
(Harvey  et  al.,  2008).  Changes  in  respiratory  and 
cardiac  rate  were  modelled  using  the  respiration 
response  function  (RRF)  (Birn  et  al.,  2008)  and 
cardiac response function (CRF) (Chang et al., 2009), 
respectively.  Following  the  recommendations  in 
Chang et al. (2009) and Falahpour et al. (2013), and 
to  accommodate  the  (negative)  latency  of  -8 s 
between  the  estimated  RRF  from  the  breath-hold 
experiments  and  the  rest  data  found  in  Birn  et  al. 
(2008), specific delay values were estimated for the 
RRF  and  CRF  for  each  individual  participant.  Based 
on the latencies reported in Birn et al. (2008), delay 
values of -12, -8, -4, 0, 4, 8 and 12 s were examined. 
The  response  delay  for  each  participant  was  then 
defined  based  on  the  highest  number  of  supra-
threshold  voxels  obtained  in  an  F-test  for  each 
response function using the first short-TR run of each 
subject.  To  model  remaining  signal  fluctuations 
related  to movement,  the  Volterra  expansion  of  the 
realignment  parameters  was  used  (Friston  et  al., 
1996). The derivative, square and squared derivative 
totalling  24 
of 
the  short-TR 
regressors  were  estimated

Model Estimation and Analysis 
Two  task  regressors  for  the  simple  and  complex 
movement condition were constructed by specifying 
the  respective  onsets  and  duration  (18s)  of  each 
block.  The  resulting  box  functions  were  then 
canonical  hemodynamic 
convolved  with 
response  function  using  the  standard  parameters 
provided in SPM12 and its temporal and dispersion 
derivatives. 

the 

To  investigate  the  impact  of  physiological  noise 
modelling, the estimation process was repeated with 
four  different  sets  of  nuisance  regressors:  (i)  ‘no 
phys’ uses the realignment and task regressors, but 
no  physiological  noise  regressors,  (ii)  ‘RETROICOR’ 
adds the physiological noise regressors as described 
in the RETROICOR model (Glover et al., 2000) to the 
task and realignment regressors, (iii) ‘RETROICOR + 

 
RRF + CRF’ incorporates the RETROICOR regressors 
and  RRF  (Birn  et  al.,  2008)  and  CRF  (Chang  et  al., 
2009),  (iv) 
‘RETROICOR  +  Volterra’  contains 
RETROICOR  regressors  in  combination  with  the 
Volterra  expansion  of  the  realignment  parameters 
(Friston et al., 1996) for the short-TR sequence. 

Similar  to  previous  studies,  the  short-TR  sequence 
was  downsampled  by  a  factor  of  4  to  create  an 
artificial  long-TR sequence  (Boyacioğlu  et al.,  2015; 
Todd et al., 2017). Thereby, an fMRI time series that 
matches  the  spatial  resolution  of  the  short-TR 
sequence but has the temporal characteristics as if it 
were  acquired  with  a  TR  of  2356 ms  was  obtained. 
This permitted the effect of serial correlations to be 
investigated  on  a  downsampled  short-TR  sequence 
with otherwise identical signal properties compared 
to  the  short-TR  sequence  and  on  the  long-TR 
sequence in a more realistic setting when taking full 
advantage of current imaging capabilities.

Bayesian  model  estimation  was  then  performed  to 
investigate the strength and characteristics of serial 
correlations in the fMRI time series. To this end, the 
VB framework (Penny et al., 2003, 2005) was used to 
compute  log  model  evidence  maps,  containing  the 
contribution to the overall model evidence from each 
voxel  (Penny  et  al.,  2007),  for  different  AR  model 
orders  ranging  from  1  to  10.  This  enabled  the 
determination of the optimal AR model order in each 
voxel required to model the serial correlations in the 
fMRI  data.  In  addition,  the  impact  of  physiological 
noise  modelling  on 
correlations  was 
investigated  by  using  the  four  different  sets  of 
nuisance 
An 
uninformative  (flat)  signal  prior  and  unweighted 
graph  Laplacian  (Harrison  et  al.,  2008,  2007)  noise 
priors  were  chosen 
the  Bayesian  model 
for 
estimation  which  was  performed  in  a  slice-by-slice 
fashion.  To  include  the  same  data  for  different  AR 
model  orders,  and  thereby  to  allow  a  comparison 
between  log  model  evidence  maps,  the  first  𝑝 − 1 
scans  with  𝑝  being  the  respective  AR  model  order 
were removed from the data (Penny et al., 2003). The 
optimal  AR  model  order  for  every  voxel  was 
determined  as  the  AR  model  with  the  highest  log 
model evidence for each set of nuisance regressors. 
To examine the evidence for a higher order AR-model 
in the presence of physiological noise modelling, log 
Bayes factors comparing AR model orders 4 to 1 were 
computed  as  the  difference  of  the  respective  log 
model  evidences  (Kass  and  Raftery,  1995)  for  the 
‘RETROICOR  +  RRF  +  CRF’  model  for  all  three 
sequences

‘RETROICOR+Volterra’  model  for  the  case  of  the

The optimal  AR model  order  was  then  summarized 
by  computing  the  mean  distribution  of  the  voxel 
count over all subjects and runs in 6 different regions 
of interest (ROIs). The voxel count (in %) represents 
the  number  of  voxel  with  AR  model  order  1  to  10 
being the winning model, i.e. having the highest  log 
model evidence, divided by the total number of voxel 
in each region. The 6 ROIs comprised the three tissue 
classes  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF),  grey  matter  (GM) 
and  white  matter  (WM)  as  well  as  three  regions 
expected to be involved in the task, i.e. primary motor 
cortex  (M1),  supplementary  motor  area  (SMA)  and 
putamen (Bednark et al., 2015). The cortical ROIs M1 
and  SMA  were  defined  using  the  Harvard-Oxford 
cortical  structural  atlas  as  distributed  with  the 
FMRIB Software Library (Desikan et al., 2006; Frazier 
et al., 2005; Goldstein et al., 2007; Makris et al., 2006). 
The  ROI  for  the  putamen  was  derived  from  high-
resolution 7T imaging (Keuken et al., 2014; Tziortzi 
et al., 2011). The ROIs were limited to grey matter by 
multiplying  each  ROI  with  a  grey  matter  mask 
derived by thresholding the grey matter TPM at 0.9. 

To  visualize  the  noise  characteristics  fitted  by  the 
different  AR  models,  their  power  spectra  were 
estimated using the SPM function spm_ar_freq.m. For 
each voxel, the AR coefficients of the winning model 
were  extracted and  the  spectra estimated.  For  each 
AR  model  order,  the  obtained  spectra  were  then 
averaged  and  compared  across  the  four  different 
noise modelling schemes. Additionally, the spectrum 
when using an AR model of order 1 was compared to 
the spectrum using the optimal AR model. 

Classical  model  estimation  was  performed  to 
investigate the spectrum of the residuals visualizing 
the impact of physiological noise modelling and pre-
whitening on the frequency content of the image time 
series and providing insight into possible remaining 
noise  sources.  Therein,  the  two  different  pre-
whitening  strategies  as  provided  in  SPM 12  were 
used: either the AR(1) or the FAST model, which uses 
a  dictionary  of  covariance  components  based  upon 
exponential covariance functions. Likewise as for the 
Bayesian  model 
classical  model 
estimation, 
estimation was performed for the four different noise 
modelling schemes with either of the pre-whitening 
options. The average amplitude spectrum of all grey 
matter voxels was then computed from the residual 
time series obtained after model fitting. 

In  summary,  Bayesian  model  estimation  was 
performed  using  data  with  three  TRs  (589 ms, 
1990 ms  and  2356 ms),  and  four  noise  modelling 
methods (no phys; RETROICOR; RETROICOR + RRF + 
CRF,  RETROICOR  +  Volterra).  Similarly,  classical 
model  estimation  was  performed  using  either  an 
AR(1)  model  or  the  FAST  option  in  SPM  for  pre-

whitening.  To 
investigate  the  effect  of  spatial 
smoothing,  the  analysis  was  repeated  on  the  un-
smoothed data obtained with the short-TR sequence. 

Results 
Optimal  AR  Model  Orders  and  the  Impact  of 
Physiological Noise Modelling 
To  investigate  serial  correlations  and  the  effect  of 
physiological  noise  modelling  for  the  short-TR 
sequence, optimal AR model orders obtained for the 
four  noise  modelling  schemes  are  illustrated  in 
Figure 1. A high optimal AR model order of up to 10 
was found in large areas, especially in CSF and grey 
matter  regions,  when  no  physiological  noise 
modelling was performed (Figure 1, 1st column). This 
indicates a complex, non-white noise structure in the 
fMRI time series. Including RETROICOR regressors to 
model  cardiac  and  respiratory  signal  fluctuations 
successfully reduced the optimal AR model order to 
approximately  4  and  below  (Figure  1,  2nd  column). 
High  AR  model  orders  remained  in  ventricles  and 
tissue-air  boundaries.

and  respiration  (‘RETROICOR  +  RRF  +  CRF’)  had  a

Including 
(‘RETROICOR + Volterra’) mainly reduced optimal AR 
model orders at the anterior and posterior tissue-air 
boundaries (white arrows in Figure 1, 4th column). In 
general, white matter areas showed lower AR model 
orders, with some voxel having an optimal AR model 
order of 1. 

The distribution of optimal AR model orders shows 
the  impact  of  physiological  noise  modelling  for 
different  tissue  classes  and  in  different  cortical  and 
subcortical  regions  (Figure  2):  Grey  matter  had  a 
large number of voxels with a high optimal AR model 
order  without  physiological  noise  modelling,  i.e. 
37 % of the voxels had an optimal AR model order > 5 
(Figure  2,  top  left).  For  comparison,  48 %  of  the 
voxels in CSF (Figure 2, centre left), but only 20 % of 
the voxels in white matter had an optimal AR model 
order  >  5  (Figure  2,  top  bottom).  Including 
RETROICOR  regressors  had  the 
impact 
reducing  the  number  of  voxels  with  optimal  AR 
model order > 5 to 16 % in grey matter, 21 % in CSF, 
and  10 %  in  white  matter.  Adding  RRF  +  CRF 
regressors further reduced this amount by 1 % in all 
three tissue classes. Additional movement regressors 
had a slightly larger impact, reducing the number of 
voxels with optimal AR model orders > 5 to 14 % in 
grey matter, 17 % in CSF and 9 % in white matter. In 
total,  68 %  of  the  grey  matter  voxels  had  an  AR 
optimal model order ranging between 2 and 4 when 
using  the  RETROICOR  noise  modelling  scheme 
(Figure  2,  top  left).  The  highest  voxel  count  in  grey 
6 

largest 

matter was obtained for an AR model order of 4, with 
28 % favouring this AR model under the RETROICOR 
+ Volterra noise modelling scheme. Interestingly, the 
voxel count for an optimal AR model order of 1 was 
< 7 % 
tissue  classes  even  with 
physiological noise modelling. 

in  all 

three 

The  grey  matter  voxels  in  M1  and  SMA  showed 
comparable  properties  with  regard  to  voxel  count 
and  impact  of  physiological  noise  modelling  as  the 
whole  grey  matter.  When  including  RETROICOR 
regressors  69 %  of  the  voxels  in  M1  supported  an 
optimal AR model order between 2 and 4, and only 
15 % supported an AR model order > 5 (Figure 2, top 
right). Similarly in SMA, 60 % of the voxels supported 
an optimal AR model order between 2 and 4 and only 
12 %  supported  an  AR  model  order  > 5.  (Figure  2, 
centre right). However, the voxel count for an optimal 
AR model order of 1 (20 %) was much higher than in 
the  previously  discussed  ROIs.  Including  additional 
regressors  for  cardiac  and  respiration  response 
modelling  (RETROICOR  +  RRF  +  CRF)  or  additional 
movement regressors (RETROICOR + Volterra) had a 
smaller  impact  giving  results  comparable  to  the 
RETROICOR noise model. The distribution of optimal 
AR model orders in the putamen showed a different 
pattern, with a maximum of 46 % supporting an AR 
model order of 2 and only 9 % of the voxels with an 
optimal  AR  model  order  > 3  when  including  the 
RETROICOR regressors (Figure 2, bottom right). As in 
the  SMA,  the  voxel  count  supporting  an  AR  model 
order of 1 (33 %) was much higher than in the whole 
grey matter. 

summary, 

In 
region-specific 
tissue-class  and 
distributions of optimal AR model orders were found. 
Including physiological noise regressors successfully 
reduced  the  number  of  voxel  with  high  AR  model 
orders and, consequently, increased the voxel count 
with low optimal AR model orders. Nevertheless, an 
AR  model  of  order  1  proved  insufficient  for  most 
voxels. Most grey matter areas still had an optimal AR 
model order ranging between 2 and 4. 

In comparison, optimal AR model orders for the long-
TR  sequence  remained  low,  with  the  majority  of 
voxels  having  an  optimal  AR  model  order  of  1  or  2 
even  without  physiological  noise  modelling  (Figure 
3A,  left  column).  Elevated  AR  model  orders  were 
observed in the vicinity of the circle of Willis and the 
ventricles,  but  also  close  to  the  insula  and  the 
anterior cingulate cortex (white arrows in Figure 3A, 
left  column).  Including  regressors  for  physiological 
noise  successfully  reduced  the  optimal  AR  model 
order  in  these  areas  (Figure  3A,  centre  and  right 
column),  with  virtually  no  difference  between 
RETROICOR regressors only and the ‘RETROICOR + 
CRF + RRF’ noise modelling scheme. Optimal AR

the  downsampled  short-TR 
model  orders 
sequence  (Figure  3B)  exhibited  nearly  identical 
characteristics as for the long-TR data. Slightly higher 
AR model orders were observed in a small number of 
voxels without physiological noise modelling (Figure 
3B, left column). When including physiological noise 
regressors,  low  optimal  AR  model  orders  of  1  or  2 
were obtained (Figure 3B, centre and right column). 

The voxel count across subjects and runs for the long-
TR  sequences  showed  a  majority  of  voxel  with  an 
optimal  AR  model  order  of  1  (Figure  4A).  Even 
without  physiological  noise  modelling,  45 %  of  the 
grey  matter  (Figure  4A,  top  left),  39 %  of  the  CSF 
(Figure 4A, centre left), and 74 % of the white matter 
voxels  (Figure  4A,  bottom  left)  had  an  optimal  AR 
model order of 1. These numbers were increased to

with optimal AR model order > 3 was below 6 % in all 
three  tissue  classes.  The  distribution  of  optimal  AR 
model  orders  in  M1  and  SMA  grey  matter  voxels

grey matter (Figure 4A, top and centre right).

As  observed 
the 
distribution  in  the  putamen  is  distinct  from  the 
previous ROIs and resembled features comparable to 
white matter voxels with 85 % of the voxels having 
an  optimal  AR  model  of  order  1  when  including 
RETROICOR  +  RRF  +  CRF  regressors  (Figure  4A, 
bottom right). This number was only slightly reduced 
(to 80 %) when no physiological noise modelling was 
performed. Optimal AR model orders for the

(RIGHT) for (A) the long-TR sequence (subject 1, run 1, TR = 1990 ms, 1.3×1.3×1.3 mm3, smoothed with a 5 mm 
FWHM  Gaussian  kernel)  and  (B)  the  downsampled  short-TR  sequence  (subject  1,  run  1,  TR  =  2356 ms, 
2.5×2.5×2.5 mm3,  smoothed  with  a  5  mm  FWHM  Gaussian  kernel).  The  white  arrows  indicate  elevated  AR 
model orders obtained without physiological noise modelling in the vicinity of the circle of Willis, the insula 
and the anterior cingulate cortex. 

downsampled  short-TR  sequence  follow  a  similar 
distribution,  but  with  slightly  higher  values  for  AR 
model order 2 (Figure 4B). Including RETROICOR + 
RRF  +  CRF  regressors,  49 %  of  the  voxel  in  CSF 
(Figure 4B, top left), 51 % of the voxel in grey matter 
(Figure 4B, centre left) and 70 % of the voxel in white 
matter  (Figure  4B,  bottom  left)  had  an  optimal  AR 
model order of 1. The number of voxels with optimal 
AR model order > 3 was below 3 % in all three tissue 
classes.  Again,  M1  (Figure  4B,  top  right)  and  SMA 
(Figure 4B, centre right) had comparable properties 
as the whole grey matter, with 51 % and 43 % of the 
voxel  having  an  optimal  AR  model  order  of  1. 
Similarly, the highest number of voxels with optimal 
AR model order 1 (80 %) were found in the putamen. 

In  summary,  the  choice  of  the  physiological  noise 
modelling  scheme  has  limited  influence  on  the 
optimal  AR  model  order  for  the  long-TR  sequence 
and  the  downsampled  short-TR  sequence,  with 

largest  effects  in  CSF  and  grey  matter  regions.  A 
majority of voxel have an optimal AR model order of 
1  or  2  even  in  the  absence  of  physiological  noise 
modelling. 

Bayes Factor Analysis 
To assess the statistical significance of the obtained 
optimal orders, log Bayes factors were computed as 
the  difference  in  log  model  evidence  (Kass  and 
Raftery, 1995). For the short-TR sequence, log Bayes 
factors comparing an AR model of order 4 to an AR 
model of order 1 showed positive evidence (BF > 3, 
corresponding  to  a  posterior  model  probability  > 
95 %) for the higher AR model order in large areas of 
the brain, even when including RETROICOR + RRF + 
CRF  (Figure  5,  1st  column)  or  RETRICOR  +  Volterra 
regressors (Figure 5, 2nd column). Some white matter 
voxel  showed  support  for  the  AR(1)-model  as 
expected  from  Figure 1,  where  AR(1)  was  the 
winning model.

(orange)  for  (A)  the  long-TR  sequence  (TR  =  1990 ms,  1.3×1.3×1.3 mm3,  smoothed  with  a  5  mm  FWHM

with a 5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel). The voxel count represents the number of voxels with AR model order

voxels in each region.

In  contrast,  for  the  long-TR  sequence  positive 
evidence was mostly found for the AR(1)-model, with 
only a few patches favouring an AR model order of 4

large areas of the brain, log Bayes factors remain very 
low, indicating no clear evidence for any of the two 
models.

AR Coefficient Analysis 
The  spectra 
illustrate  the  noise 
characteristics  that  were  fitted  by  the  different  AR 
models. Frequencies found in the fMRI time series are 
down  weighted,  i.e.  showing  a  dip  in  the  estimated 
spectra. For example, the spectra for AR model order 
10 without physiological noise modelling  (Figure 6, 
2nd column, bottom) showed a clear dip at the cardiac 
frequency (~ 0.66 Hz) indicating that a strong signal 
was present at this frequency and has been fitted by 
the AR model. Across all AR model orders, damping 
of low frequency oscillations was observed (Figure 6, 
10 

left).  Up  to  AR  model  order  4,  no  differences  in  the 
spectra obtained from the different noise modelling 
schemes  were  found.  However,  the  spectra  showed 
increased  damping  of  low  frequency  components 
with increasing AR model order. For even higher AR 
model  orders,  cardiac  and  respiratory  frequencies 
can be found in the spectrum, especially in the case of 
no  physiological  noise  modelling.  Comparing  the 
spectrum of the winning model with the AR(1)-model 
when including RETOICOR, RRF and CRF regressors 
shows  that  the  AR(1)-model  can  only  approximate 
the  required,  more  complex  shape  of  the  power 
spectra  in  the  voxel  with  higher  optimal  AR  model 
order (Figure 6, right). The largest differences were 
observed for the high frequency part of the spectrum.

The spectrum of the ‘no phys’ modelling scheme was 
utilized to identify possible remaining noise sources. 
In particular, the short-TR sequence showed distinct 
peaks  in  good  agreement  with  the  measured  heart 
and  breathing  rates  (Figure  8):  cardiac  –  0.66Hz 
(aliased), respiration – 0.31 Hz, interaction – 0.35 Hz, 
as well as low frequency oscillations in grey matter 
following a 1/f characteristic. Including RETROICOR 
regressors  successfully  removed  the  cardiac  and 
respiratory frequency components. The impact of the 

low  frequency  regressors  modelling  cardiac  and 
respiratory variations (RETROICOR + RRF + CRF) or 
remaining  movement-related  signal 
fluctuations 
(RETROICOR  +  Volterra)  was  limited,  with  most  of 
the  non-white  noise  characteristics  in  the  low 
frequency  range  still  being  present.  Comparing  the 
two  pre-whitening  options,  the  FAST  noise  model 
(Figure 8, bottom) reduced the remaining 1/f noise 
compared  to  the  AR(1)  model  (Figure  8,  top).  Note 
that the cardiac and respiratory components remain 
in the spectrum. Adding RETROICOR regressors

physiological frequencies (0.09 Hz – cardiac, 0.16 Hz 
– respiration, and 0.1 Hz – interaction) could not be 
discerned.  Including  physiological  noise  regressors 
reduced the energy content across a broad range of 
frequencies,  with  only  a  slight  reduction  in  peak 
height  and  number.  Similarly  for  the  downsampled 
short-TR  sequence,  both  pre-whitening  options 
resulted in a nearly flat noise distribution (Figure 9B) 
with  not  distinct  peaks  at  the  aliased  physiological 

frequencies  (0.18 Hz  –  cardiac,  0.1 Hz  –  respiration

Impact of Smoothing 
Estimating  optimal  AR  model  orders  on  the  un-
smoothed  data  showed  very  high  AR  model  orders 
mainly in CSF-bearing regions, but also close to the 
insula  and  the  anterior  cingulate  cortex  (white 
arrows in Figure 10, 1st column), as well as moderate 
optimal AR model orders in grey matter regions

without physiological noise modelling (Figure 10, 1st 
column).  Nearly  all  white  matter  voxels  showed  an 
optimal AR model order of 1. Including RETROICOR 
regressors successfully reduced the higher AR model 
orders  in  CSF  and  grey  matter  regions,  with  a 
remaining  AR  model  order  of  2  to  4  in  most  grey 
matter  areas  (Figure  10,  2nd  column).  Some  voxels 
with AR model order 10 can be found in posterior and 
anterior  regions  near  tissue-air  boundaries  (white 
arrow in Figure 10, 2nd column). Adding RRF + CRF 
regressors had a limited impact on optimal AR model 
orders  (Figure  10,  3rd  column).  The  additional 
movement  regressors  (RETROICOR  +  Volterra) 
reduced optimal AR model orders in a small number 
of  voxels  at  the  posterior  and  anterior  tissue-air

Effect of TR and Physiological Noise on Optimal 
AR Model Order 
The  high  AR  model  orders  found  in  the  short-TR 
sequence 
indicate  a  complex  noise  covariance 
structure that needs to be taken into account when 
drawing  inference  on  single-subject  fMRI  data.  As 
expected, physiological noise regressors as provided 
through the RETROICOR model (Glover et al., 2000) 

successfully  reduced  serial  correlations  in  the  fMRI 
time series, resulting in decreased optimal AR model 
orders.  However,  optimal  AR  model  orders  ranging 
between  two  and  four  were  still  found  even  after 
including physiological noise regressors. 

The  broad  distribution  of  optimal  AR  model  orders 
across  all  grey  matter  voxels  contradicts  remaining 
task related activity as a possible noise source. Also, 
the  low  optimal  AR  model  order  found  in  white 
matter  excludes  the  possibility  of  hardware  related 
sources  which  would  affect  grey  and  white  matter 
equally.  In  the  power  spectra  in  Figure  6  and  the 
residuum  spectra  in  Figure  8  not  a  single  unique 
frequency  could  be  identified  driving  the  observed 
effects.  Rather,  a  broad  1/f  noise  characteristic  and 
large  variance  around  the  cardiac  peaks  were 
observed.  This 
indicates  un-modelled  neuronal 
activity  (Bianciardi  et  al.,  2009),  given  the  high 
intrinsic  serial  correlation  of  the  hemodynamic 
response function (Arbabshirani et al., 2014), as well 
as remaining physiological fluctuations not captured 
by the linear RETROICOR model as possible sources. 
Noise sources of even higher frequency seem unlikely 
other  than  the  known  cardiac  and  respiratory 
fluctuations and their higher harmonics (Weisskoff et 
al., 1993).

and  respiration  response  function  modelling  (3RD  COLUMN)  and  with  RETROICOR  regressors  and  Volterra 
expansion of the realignment parameters (4TH COLUMN) when no smoothing was applied (subject 1, run 1, TR = 
589 ms, 2.5×2.5×2.5 mm3). The white arrows indicate high remaining optimal AR model orders at posterior 
and anterior tissue-air boundaries with RETROICOR regressors (2ND COLUMN), and their slight reduction when 
including RETROICOR + Volterra regressors (4TH COLUMN). 

Accounting for remaining low frequency oscillations 
through  cardiac  and  respiration  response  function 
modelling  had  a  comparatively  limited  impact, 
indicating  either  their  localized  reach  or  that  more 
individualized response functions might be required 
(Falahpour et al., 2013). If specialized equipment is 
available,  more  direct  measures  of  end-tidal  CO2 
through carbon-dioxide data (Wise et al., 2004) and 
blood flow and oxygenation using near-infrared  
16 

spectroscopy  data  (Frederick  et  al.,  2012)  could 
improve the modelling of physiological processes in 
the  low-frequency  range.  Including  the  Volterra 
expansion  of  the  realignment  regressors  to  model 
remaining  movement  related  signals  (Friston  et  al., 
1996) had a small impact mainly limited to voxels at

correlations introduced through respiration could be 
slightly  underestimated  in  the  results  presented 
here. 

the 

Low AR model orders were obtained for the long-TR 
and the downsampled short-TR sequence in line with 
previous  studies  (Lund  et  al.,  2006;  Penny  et  al., 
2003).  Despite  their  different  spatial  resolutions, 
virtually  identical  results  were  obtained  from  both 
sequences,  indicating  that  extensive  aliasing  in 
sequences  with  a  TR  above  2 seconds  presumably 
renders individual noise processes indistinguishable, 
resulting in low optimal AR model orders. This is in 
line with the observation of a negligible change in t-
values  with  increasing  AR  model  order  for  data 
acquired  with  long  TRs  and  a  reduction  in  t-values 
with  increasing  AR  model  order  for  data  acquired 
with shorter TRs (Sahib et al., 2016). 

Implications  for  Error  Modelling  in  Statistical 
Inference 
When  using  pre-whitening  to  account  for  serial 
correlations, the complex noise structure found in the 
data  acquired  with  sub-second  TR  needs  to  be 
accommodated  in  the  estimation  of  the  error 
covariance 𝑉. When choosing the AR model order for 
spectral estimation, too low AR model orders result 
in too smooth estimates, whereas too high AR model 
orders can lead to spurious peaks (Schlindwein and 
Evans,  1992).  Applied  to  empirical  data,  using  a 
higher  AR  model  order  rather  than  a  too  low  AR 
model  order  has  been  recommended  for  spectral 
estimation (Boardman et al., 2002; Schlindwein and 
Evans,  1992).  Alternatively,  the  FAST  noise  model 
introduced in SPM12 has shown promising results, as 
indicated  in  the  frequency  spectra  of  the  residuals 
(Figure  8,  bottom).  However,  the  cardiac  and 
respiratory  peak  could  not  be  accounted  for,  and, 
therefore,  additional  noise  modelling  strategies 
targeting  these  specific  frequencies  are  required. 
Either 
and 
incorporating  nuisance  regressors  for  physiological 
fluctuations  or  specifying  a  comprehensive  noise 
model  that  can  capture  serial  correlations  obtained 
from  a  broad  range  of  TR  values  might  be  the  way 
forward. 

the  noise 

identifying 

sources 

As observed previously (Kaneoke et al., 2012), noise 
characteristics  varied  across  tissue  classes  and 
cortical and subcortical regions. Grey matter voxels 
showed  properties  of  both  CSF  and  white  matter, 
which  could  be  partially  introduced  through  the 
applied spatial smoothing and partial volume effects. 
Indeed, the optimal AR model orders obtained for the 
unsmoothed data show extended white matter areas 

with  optimal  AR  model  order  1,  elevated  AR  model 
orders  in  grey  matter,  and  extreme  values  almost 
exclusively in CSF-bearing regions. While smoothing 
might  introduce  noise  in  adjacent  voxels,  it  also 
considerably 
increases  the  signal-to-noise  ratio 
(SNR)  and  functional  sensitivity.  These  results 
highlight  that  careful  selection  of  voxels  for  noise 
estimation  purposes  is  required,  as  previously 
suggested in Purdon et al. (2001) and Woolrich et al. 
(2001).  Pooling  across  voxels  to  estimate  the 
stationary temporal covariance 𝑉 might thus remain 
feasible when carefully selecting voxels with similar 
noise properties. 

When using the VB framework to infer about regional 
activation in response to a task, spatial priors express 
the spatial contingency of evoked responses (Penny 
et al., 2005) as well as any further prior knowledge. 
Given the distinct noise properties of different tissue 
classes  found  in  this  work  and  previous  studies 
(Penny et al., 2003; Woolrich et al., 2001), one might 
conclude  that  tissue  specific  priors  could  improve 
noise  modelling.  However,  Penny  et  al.  (2007) 
showed  that  Gaussian  Markov  Random  Field  priors 
(Woolrich  et  al.,  2004),  which  assume  the  AR 
coefficient  to  vary  smoothly,  supersede  tissue 
specific  priors  modelling  the  spatial  variability  in 
serial  correlations.  Given  the  observed  variance  in 
optimal  AR  model  orders  (Figure  10)  and  AR 
coefficient  values  (Figure  7)  between  different 
cortical  and  subcortical  regions  we  anticipate  a 
similar outcome for the data presented here. 

Limitations and Considerations 
When employing SMS acceleration to increase BOLD 
sensitivity  in  fMRI  time  series,  two  counteracting 
mechanisms need to be considered. On one hand, the 
temporal  SNR  decreases  with 
increasing  SMS 
acceleration factor  (Chen et al., 2015). On the other 
hand, the number of samples per unit time increases, 
although the effective degrees of freedom do not rise 
at  the  same  rate  due  to  serial  correlations.  First 
investigations show that moderate SMS acceleration 
factors between two and six strike a balance between 
the two (Todd et al., 2016). It is clear, however, that 
the  effects  of  physiological  noise  needs  to  be  further 
evaluated when employing SMS acceleration, given its 
determining role for temporal SNR (Todd et al., 2017; 
Triantafyllou  et  al.,  2005).  Importantly,  the  spatial 
variability of different noise processes might render 
different  SMS-factors  optimal  for  different  ROIs 
(Todd et al., 2017). 

We  have  limited  our  considerations  to  the  single-
subject level, keeping in mind the increased interest 
in using ultra-high field fMRI in single subject studies 
(Branco et al., 2016; De Martino et al., 2011; Stephan 
et  al.,  2017).  However,  group  studies  employing 

17 

 
mixed-effect  models  also  rely  on  the  precise 
estimation of effect sizes and their variance (Chen et 
al., 2012). Since an unbiased estimator is used for the 
parameters,  random-effects  analyses  are  more 
robust  against  deviations  in  the  error  covariance 
estimation. 

Conclusion 
Unlike  fMRI  time  series  with  a 
longer,  more 
conventional TR of ~ 2 s, SMS EPI data with a short 
TR of ~ 600 ms exhibit a complex noise structure that 
cannot  be  captured  by  an  AR(1)  model.  While 
physiological  noise  modelling  successfully  reduces 
serial  correlations,  an  advanced  noise  model  is  still 
required to account for the non-white noise content. 
Otherwise, single-subject analyses of fMRI data with 
sub-second TR will result in increased false positive 
rates,  effectively  declaring  voxels  as  active  without 
the prescribed significance. Hence, for valid inference 
on  single  subject-level  with  sub-second  TR,  more 
advanced  pre-whitening  schemes  in  combination 
with physiological noise modelling are necessary.
