The onsets of deconﬁnement and ﬁreball of NA61/SHINE

Abstract. The NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS is pursuing a rich
programme on strong interactions, covering the study of onset of deconﬁne-
ment and aims to discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter by
performing an energy and system-size scan at the full CERN SPS momentum
range. These scans of p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb have been mostly
completed with Xe+La last year (more Pb+Pb to to taken this year).
Results from the diﬀerent reactions are now emerging. As a surprise, some
measurements did not scale smoothly. In particular, for the K+/π+ ratio, Be+Be
collisions behaved similarly to p+p (as superposition of nucleon collisions),
while Ar+Sc was closer to Pb+Pb collisions. This step can not be explained by
onset of deconﬁnement, and may indicate that there is also a onset of ﬁreball
in relativistic heavy ion collisions. A review of the results as well as possible
interpretation will be presented. The theoretical models (SMES, PHSD) de-
scribe onset of deconﬁnement at the heaviest system relatively well. However,
no model describes the behaviour of data at previously unmeasured collisions
of light and intermediate size ions. The onset of ﬁreball is not described by any
model.

1 Introduction

The onset of deconﬁnement is a well established concept in strong interaction physics. The
search for it is also one of the goals of the current physics programme of the NA61/SHINE
experiment by performing a energy and system-size scan at the CERN SPS. However, the
analysis of this scan has revealed phenomena that has properties of an onset, but can not be
ascribed to the onset deconﬁnement. This hits at an additional onset eﬀect related to the size
of the colliding systems.

2 Onset of deconﬁnement

√

The creation of Quark–Gluon-Plasma (QGP) in A+A collisions begins with increasing col-
S NN as seen in Figure 2. At lower temperatures and/or baryon chemical
lision energy
potential, strongly interacting matter is conﬁned inside hadrons, while at higher temperatures
and/or baryon chemical potential, strongly interacting matter is believed to be in a deconﬁned
state in QGP.

There are several potential signatures of onset of deconﬁnement that can be searched for
experimentally. The particle ratio of K+/π+, Figure 2, is predicted by SMES [1] to change
rapidly around the transition to a deconﬁned state. This eﬀect is also known as the “horn”.

strongly interaction matter (right). The onset
of deconﬁnement takes place in the early stage
when the transition line is crossed (left).

Figure 2. Particle ratios for K+/π+ (left) and (cid:104)K+(cid:105)/(cid:104)π+(cid:105) (right). The horn structure is clearly visible
for Pb+Pb collisions, while for p+p a step is observed. However, while Be+Be is close to p+p, Ar+Sc
(cid:104)K+(cid:105)/(cid:104)π+(cid:105) is in between p+p/Be+Be and Pb+Pb.

Another signature is the inverse-slope “step” in temperature versus collision energy.
This is also predicted by SMES as a signature of deconﬁnement. Figure 3 shows current
NA61/SHINE measurements of this structure.

Figure 3. The step is clearly visible for Pb+Pb collisions, but also seen in p+p collisions, as well as
in Be+Be collisions which are close to p+p (left). The step-eﬀect can be seen as an analogue to the
temperature step for heating of water beyond the boiling point (right).

3 Onset of ﬁreball

Figure 2 showed that surprisingly the particle ratio for Be+Be was very close to p+p, while
Ar+Sc was between p+p/Be+Be and Pb+Pb. The naive expectation from the size of the
colliding systems would be that Be+Be would be between p+p and Ar+Sc. This may be a
hint of a further onset eﬀect, that may be referred to as “onset of ﬁreball”. This is shown
schematically in Figure 4. It is based on the assumption of beginning of creation of large

clusters of strongly interacting matter (SIM) in nucleus-nucleus collisions with increasing
mass number (A).

Figure 4. Concept of onset of ﬁreball. Until a
certain mass number, only small, oﬀ-equilibrium
clusters are created. Only when a mass number
corresponding to onset of ﬁreball will large clus-
ters of strongly interacting matter be created.

One may consider the K+/π+ ratio and multiplicity ﬂuctuation versus number of wounded
nucleons. These observables change rapidly when moving from light (p+p/Be+Be) to inter-
mediate/heavy systems, as seen in Figure 5. The heavy systems are close to statistical model
predictions for large volumes. These observations may be consistent with a beginning of
creation of large clusters of strongly interacting matter, i.e. onset of ﬁreball.

It may be possible to interpret these results in the context of the statistical model in terms
of ideal Boltzmann gas and grand canonical ensemble versus canonical ensemble. This would
yield a canonical suppression of (cid:104)N(cid:105) that may explain the jump for the K+/π+ ratio, and a
canonical enhancement of w[N] that could explain the jump for ω[N]. However, it is not clear
if this can fully explain these eﬀects.

tio (left) and multiplicity ﬂuc-
tuation (right) versus number of

ment of ω[N] on ω[N] (right).

4 Possible interpretations of the onset of ﬁreball

A possible interpretation is the percolation approach [2]. With increasing mass number A,
the density of clusters (strings, partons, etc.)
increases. Thus the probability to overlap
many elementary clusters may rapidly increase with A, which may point to the validity of
percolation models. However, this approach does not explain equilibrium models of large
clusters.

Another possible interpretation may be Ads/CFT correspondence [3]. Ads in gravity is
the formation of a black hole horizon (information trapping surface) that takes place when

critical values of model parameters are reached. CFT in QCD is that only starting from a
suﬃciently large nuclear mass number the formation of trapping surface in A+A collisions is
possible. This may be seen as an analogue to onset of ﬁreball.

5 D0 as signal of deconﬁnement
NA61/SHINE is undertaking open charm measurement programme with new Vertex Detector
(VD) [4]. The charm yields expected to be diﬀerent in a conﬁned and a deconﬁned matter
So far pilot data has been taken, where a ﬁrst direct observation, Figure 6, of D0 at SPS
energies was seen. Later this 2018 higher statistics will be taken to perform a more precise
measurements. An upgraded VD is expected to be introduced in 2021.

6 Summary

“Horn” and “step” in particle ratio and inverse slope are predicted as signature of onset of
deconﬁnement. They are now also appearing in lighter systems as p+p/Be+Be. However sur-
prisingly, Be+Be behaves similarly to p+p, while Ar+Sc is between p+p/Be+Be and Pb+Pb.
This may indicate a “second” onset: of ﬁreball. Ar+Sc/Xe+La are still being analysed; it is
expected that these will provide further information. The two onsets may indicates four do-
mains of hadron production separated by two thresholds: onset of deconﬁnement and onset
of ﬁreball, as shown in Figure 7. While onset of deconﬁnement is well established for central
Pb+Pb collisions, it is questionable for p+p and light nuclei.
