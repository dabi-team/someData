ABSTRACT

The hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) permeating galaxy clusters and groups is not pristine, as it has been continuously enriched
by metals synthesised in Type Ia (SNIa) and core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae since the major epoch of star formation (z (cid:39) 2–3).
The cluster/group enrichment history and mechanisms responsible for releasing and mixing the metals can be probed via the radial
distribution of SNIa and SNcc products within the ICM. In this paper, we use deep XMM-Newton/EPIC observations from a sample
of 44 nearby cool-core galaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals (CHEERS) to constrain the average radial O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe,
and Ni abundance proﬁles. The radial distributions of all these elements, averaged over a large sample for the ﬁrst time, represent
the best constrained proﬁles available currently. Speciﬁc attention is devoted to a proper modelling of the EPIC spectral components,
and to other systematic uncertainties that may aﬀect our results. We ﬁnd an overall decrease of the Fe abundance with radius out to
∼0.9r500 and ∼0.6r500 for clusters and groups, respectively, in good agreement with predictions from the most recent hydrodynamical
simulations. The average radial proﬁles of all the other elements (X) are also centrally peaked and, when rescaled to their average
central X/Fe ratios, follow well the Fe proﬁle out to at least ∼0.5r500. As predicted by recent simulations, we ﬁnd that the relative
contribution of SNIa (SNcc) to the total ICM enrichment is consistent with being uniform at all radii, both for clusters and groups
using two sets of SNIa and SNcc yield models that reproduce the X/Fe abundance pattern in the core well. In addition to implying that
the central metal peak is balanced between SNIa and SNcc, our results suggest that the enriching SNIa and SNcc products must share
the same origin and that the delay between the bulk of the SNIa and SNcc explosions must be shorter than the timescale necessary to
diﬀuse out the metals. Finally, we report an apparent abundance drop in the very core of 14 systems (∼32% of the sample). Possible
origins of these drops are discussed.

1. Introduction

Galaxy clusters and groups are more than a simple collection
of galaxies (and dark matter haloes), as they are permeated by
large amounts of very hot gas. This intra-cluster medium (ICM)
was heated up to 107–108 K during the gravitational assembly
of these systems, and is glowing in the X-ray band, mainly via
bremsstrahlung emission, radiative recombination, and line ra-
diation (for a review, see Böhringer & Werner 2010). Since the
ﬁrst detection of a Fe-K emission feature at ∼7 keV in its X-ray
spectra (Mitchell et al. 1976; Serlemitsos et al. 1977), it is well
established that the ICM does not have a primordial origin, but
has been enriched with heavy elements, or metals, up to typical
values of ∼0.5–1 times solar (for reviews, see Werner et al. 2008;
de Plaa 2013). Since the ICM represents about ∼80% of the total

Yu-Ying Zhang, who recently passed away.

baryonic matter in clusters, this means that there is more mass
in metals in the ICM than locked in all the cluster galaxies (e.g.
Renzini & Andreon 2014).

Despite the ﬁrst detection of several K-shell metal lines with
the Einstein observatory in the early 1980s (e.g. Canizares et al.
1979; Mushotzky et al. 1981), before 1993 only the iron (Fe)
abundance could be accurately measured in the ICM. After the
launch of ASCA, abundance studies in clusters could extend (al-
though with a limited accuracy) to oxygen (O), neon (Ne), mag-
nesium (Mg), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), argon (Ar), calcium (Ca),
and nickel (Ni), thus opening a new window on the ICM en-
richment (e.g. Mushotzky et al. 1996; Baumgartner et al. 2005).
However, the most spectacular step forward in the ﬁeld has been
achieved by the latest generation of X-ray observatories, i.e.
Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku, which allowed much more
accurate abundance measurements of these elements thanks to
the signiﬁcantly improved eﬀective area and spectral resolution

of their instruments (e.g. Tamura et al. 2001; de Plaa et al. 2006;
Werner et al. 2006a). With excellent Suzaku and XMM-Newton
exposures, the abundance of other elements, such as carbon, ni-
trogen (e.g. Werner et al. 2006a; Sanders & Fabian 2011, Mao
et al. 2017, to be submitted), or even chromium and manganese
(Tamura et al. 2009; Mernier et al. 2016a), could be reasonably
constrained as well.

Metals present in the ICM must have been synthesised by
stars and supernovae (SNe) explosions, mainly within cluster
galaxies. While O, Ne, and Mg are produced almost entirely by
core-collapse supernovae (SNcc), the Fe-peak elements mostly
originate from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). Intermediate ele-
ments (e.g. Si, S, and Ar) are synthesised by both SNIa and SNcc
(for a review, see Nomoto et al. 2013). Since the current X-ray
missions allow the measurement of the abundance of all these
elements with a good level of accuracy in the core of the ICM
(i.e. where the overall ﬂux and the metal line emissivities are
the highest), several attempts have been made to use these abun-
dances to provide constraints on SNIa and SNcc yield models in
individual objects (e.g. Werner et al. 2006b; de Plaa et al. 2006;
Bulbul et al. 2012a) or in samples (e.g. de Plaa et al. 2007; Sato
et al. 2007; Mernier et al. 2016b). From these studies, it appears
that the typical fraction of SNIa (SNcc) contributing to the en-
richment lies within ∼20–45% (55–80%), depending (mainly)
on the selected yield models.

Beyond the overall elemental abundances, witnessing the
time-integrated enrichment history in galaxy clusters and groups
since the major epoch of star formation (z (cid:39) 2–3; for a review,
see Madau & Dickinson 2014) determining the distribution of
metals within the ICM is also of crucial importance. Indeed, this
metal distribution constitutes a direct signature of, ﬁrst, the loca-
tions and epoch(s) of the enrichment and, second, the dominant
mechanisms transporting the metals into and across the ICM.
In turn, these transport mechanisms must also play a fundamen-
tal role in governing the thermodynamics of the hot gas. Since
the ASCA discovery of a strong metallicity gradient in Centau-
rus (Allen & Fabian 1994; Fukazawa et al. 1994), a systemati-
cally peaked Fe distribution in cool-core clusters and groups (i.e.
showing a strong ICM temperature decrease towards the cen-
tre) has been conﬁrmed by many studies (e.g. Matsushita et al.
1997; De Grandi & Molendi 2001; Gastaldello & Molendi 2002;
Thölken et al. 2016). On the contrary, non-cool-core clusters and
groups (i.e. with no central ICM temperature gradient) do not ex-
hibit any clear Fe abundance gradient in their cores (De Grandi &
Molendi 2001). It is likely that the Fe central excess in cool-core
clusters has been produced predominantly by the stellar popula-
tion of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) residing in the centre
of the gravitational potential well of the cluster during or after
the cluster assembly (Böhringer et al. 2004; De Grandi et al.
2004). However, this excess is often signiﬁcantly broader than
the light proﬁle of the BCG, suggesting that one or several mech-
anisms, such as turbulent diﬀusion (Rebusco et al. 2005, 2006)
or active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts (e.g. Guo & Mathews
2010), may eﬃciently diﬀuse metals out of the cluster core. Al-
ternatively, the higher concentration of Fe in the core of the ICM
may be caused by the release of metals from infalling galaxies
via ram-pressure stripping (Domainko et al. 2006) together with
galactic winds (Kapferer et al. 2007, 2009). Other processes,
such as galaxy-galaxy interactions, AGN outﬂows, or an eﬃcient
enrichment by intra-cluster stars, may also play a role (for a re-
view, see Schindler & Diaferio 2008). In addition to this central
excess, there is increasing evidence of a uniform Fe enrichment

1 and probably beyond (Fujita et al.
ﬂoor extending out to r200
2008; Werner et al. 2013; Thölken et al. 2016). This suggests
an additional early enrichment by promptly exploding SNIa, i.e.
having occurred and eﬃciently diﬀused before the cluster for-
mation. However, a precise quantiﬁcation of this uniform level
is diﬃcult, since clusters outskirts are very dim and yet poorly
understood (Molendi et al. 2016).

Whereas the ICM radial distribution of the Fe abundance
(rather well constrained thanks to its Fe-K and Fe-L emission
complexes, accessible to current X-ray telescopes) has been ex-
tensively studied in recent decades, the situation is much less
clear for the other elements. Several studies report a rather ﬂat
O (and/or Mg) proﬁle, or similarly, an increasing O/Fe (and/or
Mg/Fe) ratio towards the outer regions of the cool-core ICM
(e.g. Tamura et al. 2001; Matsushita et al. 2003; Tamura et al.
2004; Werner et al. 2006a). As for Fe, there are also indica-
tions of a positive and uniform Mg (and other SNcc products)
enrichment out to r200 (Simionescu et al. 2015; Ezer et al. 2016).
This apparent ﬂat distribution of SNcc products, contrasting with
the enhanced central enrichment from SNIa products, has led to
the picture of an early ICM enrichment by SNcc (and prompt
SNIa, see above), when galaxies underwent important episodes
of star formation. These metals would have mixed eﬃciently be-
fore the cluster assembled, contrary to delayed SNIa enrichment
originating from the red and dead BCG. This picture, however,
has been questioned by recent observations, suggesting centrally
peaked O (and/or Mg) proﬁles instead (e.g. Matsushita et al.
2007; Sato et al. 2009; Simionescu et al. 2009; Lovisari et al.
2011; Mernier et al. 2015). The radial distribution of Si, pro-
duced by both SNIa and SNcc, is also unclear, as the Si/Fe pro-
ﬁle has been reported to be sometimes ﬂat, sometimes increas-
ing with radius (e.g. Rasmussen & Ponman 2007; Lovisari et al.
2011; Million et al. 2011; Sasaki et al. 2014).

In all the studies referred to above, the O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca,
and Ni radial abundance proﬁles have been measured either for
individual (mostly cool-core) objects or for very restricted sam-
ples (≤15 objects). Consequently, in most cases, these proﬁles
suﬀer from large statistical uncertainties. In parallel, little atten-
tion has been drawn to systematic eﬀects that could potentially
bias some results. Building average abundance proﬁles (not only
for Fe, but for all the other possible elements mentioned above)
over a large sample of cool-core (and, if possible, non-cool-core)
systems is clearly needed to clarify the picture of the SNIa and
SNcc enrichment history in galaxy clusters and groups.

In this paper, we use deep XMM-Newton/EPIC observations
from a sample of 44 nearby cool-core galaxy clusters, groups,
and ellipticals to derive the average O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and
Ni abundance proﬁles in the ICM. In order to make our results as
robust as possible, speciﬁc attention is devoted to understanding
all the possible systematic biases and reducing them when possi-
ble. This paper is structured as follows. We describe the observa-
tions and our data reduction in Sect. 2, the adopted spectral mod-
elling in Sect. 3, and the averaging of the individual proﬁles over
the sample in Sect. 4. Our results, and an extensive discussion on
the remaining systematic uncertainties, are presented in Sect. 5
and Sect. 6, respectively. We discuss the possible implications of
our ﬁndings in Sect. 7 and conclude in Sect. 8. Throughout this
paper, we adopt the cosmological parameters H0 = 70 km s−1
Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7. Unless otherwise stated, the
error bars are given at 68% conﬁdence level, and the abundances

1 r∆ is deﬁned as the radius within which the mass density corresponds
to ∆ times the critical density of the Universe.

2. Observations and data preparation

All
the observations considered here are taken from the
CHEERS2 catalogue (de Plaa et al. 2017; Mernier et al. 2016a).
This sample, optimised to study chemical enrichment in the
ICM, consists of 44 nearby cool-core galaxy clusters, groups,
and ellipticals for which the O viii 1s–2p line at ∼19 Å is de-
tected with >5σ in their XMM-Newton/RGS spectra. This in-
cludes archival XMM-Newton data and several recent deep ob-
servations that were performed to complete the sample in a con-
sistent way (de Plaa et al. 2017).

We reduce the EPIC MOS 1, MOS 2, and pn data using the
XMM Science Analysis System (SAS) v14.0 and the calibra-
tion ﬁles dated by March 2015. The standard pipeline commands
emproc and epproc are used to extract the event ﬁles from the
EPIC MOS and pn data, respectively. We ﬁlter each observation
from soft-ﬂare events by applying the appropriate good time in-
terval (GTI) ﬁles following the 2σ-clipping criterion (Mernier
et al. 2015). After ﬁltering, the MOS 1, MOS 2, and pn expo-
sure times of the full sample are ∼4.5 Ms, ∼4.6 Ms, and ∼3.7
Ms, respectively (see Table 1 of Mernier et al. 2016a). Follow-
ing the usual recommendations, we keep the single-, double-
and quadruple-pixel events (pattern≤12) in MOS, and we only
keep the single-pixel events in pn (pattern=0), since the pn
double events may suﬀer from charge transfer ineﬃciency3. In
both MOS and pn, only the highest quality events are selected
(flag=0). The point sources are detected in four distinct energy
bands (0.3–2 keV, 2–4.5 keV, 4.5–7.5 keV, and 7.5–12 keV) us-
ing the task edetect_chain and further rechecked by eye. We
discard these point sources from the rest of the analysis, by ex-
cising a circular region of 10(cid:48)(cid:48) of radius around their surface
brightness peak. This radius is found to be the best compromise
between minimising the fraction of contaminating photons from
point sources and maximising the fraction of the ICM photons
considered in our spectra (Mernier et al. 2015). In some speciﬁc
cases, however, photons from very bright point sources may leak
beyond 10(cid:48)(cid:48), and consequently we adopt a larger excision radius.
In each dataset, we extract the MOS 1, MOS 2, and pn spec-
tra of eight concentric annuli of ﬁxed angular size (0(cid:48)–0.5(cid:48), 0.5(cid:48)–
1(cid:48), 1(cid:48)–2(cid:48), 2(cid:48)–3(cid:48), 3(cid:48)–4(cid:48), 4(cid:48)–6(cid:48), 6(cid:48)–9(cid:48), and 9(cid:48)–12(cid:48)), all centred on
the X-ray peak emission seen on the EPIC surface brightness im-
ages. The redistribution matrix ﬁle (RMF) and the ancillary re-
sponse ﬁle (ARF) of each spectrum are produced via the rmfgen
and arfgen SAS tasks, respectively.

3. Spectral modelling

The spectral analysis is performed using the SPEX4 package
(Kaastra et al. 1996), version 2.05. Following the method de-
scribed in Mernier et al. (2016a), we start by simultaneously ﬁt-
ting the MOS 1, MOS 2, and pn spectra of each pointing. When a
target includes two separate observations, we ﬁt their spectra si-
multaneously. Since the large number of ﬁtting parameters does
not allow us to ﬁt more than two observations simultaneously,
we form pairs of simultaneous ﬁts when an object contains three
(or more) observations. We then combine the results of the ﬁtted

pairs using a factor of 1/σ2
i , where σi is the error on the consid-
ered parameter i. We also note that the second EPIC observation
of M 87 (ObsID:0200920101) is strongly aﬀected by pile-up in
its core, owing to a sudden activity of the central AGN (Werner
et al. 2006a). Therefore, the radial proﬁles within 3(cid:48) are only
estimated with the ﬁrst observation (ObsID:0114120101).

Because of calibration issues in the soft X-ray band of the
CCDs ((cid:46)0.5 keV) and beyond ∼10 keV, we limit our MOS and
pn spectral ﬁttings to the 0.5–10 keV and 0.6–10 keV energy
bands, respectively. We rearrange the data bins in each spectrum
via the optimal binning method of Kaastra & Bleeker (2016)
to maximise the amount of information provided by the spectra
while keeping reasonable constraints on the model parameters.

3.1. Thermal emission modelling

In principle, we can model the ICM emission in SPEX with
the (redshifted and absorbed) cie thermal model. This single-
temperature model assumes that the plasma is in (or close to)
collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE), which is a reasonable
assumption (e.g. Sarazin 1986).

Although the cie model may be a good approximation of
the emitting ICM in some speciﬁc cases (i.e. when the gas is
nearly isothermal), the temperature structure within the core of
clusters and groups is often complicated and a multi-temperature
model is clearly required. In particular, ﬁtting the spectra of a
multi-phase plasma with a single-temperature model can dra-
matically aﬀect the measured Fe abundance, leading to the "Fe-
bias" (Buote & Canizares 1994; Buote & Fabian 1998; Buote
2000) or to the "inverse Fe-bias" (Rasia et al. 2008; Simionescu
et al. 2009; Gastaldello et al. 2010). Taking this caveat into ac-
count, we model the ICM emission with a gdem model (e.g.
de Plaa et al. 2006), which is also available in SPEX. This
multi-temperature component models a CIE plasma following
a Gaussian-shaped temperature distribution,

Y(x) =

√

σT

exp




(1)

where x = log(kT ), xmean = log(kTmean), kTmean is the mean tem-
perature of the distribution, σT is the width of the distribution,
and Y0 is the total integrated emission measure. The other pa-
rameters are similar as in the cie model. By deﬁnition, a gdem
model with σT = 0 reproduces a cie (i.e. single-temperature)
model. The free parameters of the gdem model are the normal-
isation (or emission measure) Y0 = (cid:82)
nenH dV, the temperature
parameters kTmean and σT , and the abundances of O, Ne, Mg,
Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni (given with respect to the proto-solar
table of Lodders et al. 2009, see Sect. 1). Because these analyses
are out of the scope of this paper, we devote the radial analyses
of the temperatures, emission measures, and subsequent densi-
ties and entropies for a future work. The abundances of the Z≤7
elements are ﬁxed to the proto-solar unity, while the remaining
abundances are ﬁxed to the Fe value. As mentioned by Leccardi
& Molendi (2008), constraining the free abundance parameters
to positive values only (for obvious physical reasons) may result
in a statistical bias when averaging out the proﬁles. Therefore,
we allow all the best-ﬁt abundances to take positive and negative
values. Following Mernier et al. (2016a), the measured O abun-
dances have been corrected from updated parametrisation of the
radiative recombination rates (see also de Plaa et al. 2017). Since
Ne abundances measured with EPIC are highly unreliable (be-
cause the main Ne emission feature is entirely blended with the

A&A proofs: manuscript no. Radial_abundances_hk

Fe-L complex at EPIC spectral resolution), we do not consider
them in the rest of the paper.

The absorption of the ICM photons by neutral interstellar
matter is reproduced by a hot model, where the temperature
parameter is ﬁxed to 0.5 eV (see the SPEX manual). Because
adopting the column densities of Willingale et al. (2013) – taking
both atomic and molecular hydrogen into account – sometimes
leads to poor spectral ﬁts, we perform a grid search of the best-ﬁt
NH parameter within the limits

NH i − 5 × 1019 cm−2 ≤ NH ≤ NH,tot + 1 × 1020 cm−2,

(2)

where NH i and NH,tot are the atomic and total (atomic and molec-
ular) hydrogen column densities, respectively (for further de-
tails, see Mernier et al. 2016a).

3.2. Background modelling

Whereas in the core of bright clusters the ICM emission is
largely dominant, in cluster outskirts the background plays an
important role and sometimes may even dominate. For extended
objects, a background subtraction applied to the raw spectra is
clearly not advised because a slightly incorrect scaling may lead
to dramatic changes in the derived temperatures (de Plaa et al.
2006). In turn, since the metal line emissivities depend on the as-
sumed plasma temperature, this approach may lead to erroneous
abundance measurements outside the cluster cores. Moreover,
the observed background data (usually obtained from blank-ﬁeld
observations) may signiﬁcantly vary with time and position on
the sky.

Instead, we choose to model the background directly in the
spectral ﬁts by adopting the method extensively described in
Mernier et al. (2015). The total background emission is decom-
posed into ﬁve components as follows:

1. The Galactic thermal emission (GTE) is modelled by an ab-

sorbed cie component with proto-solar abundances.

2. The local hot bubble (LHB) is modelled by a (unabsorbed)

cie component with proto-solar abundances.

3. The unresolved point sources (UPS), whose accumulated
ﬂux can account for a signiﬁcant fraction of the background
emission, are modelled by a power law of index ΓUPS = 1.41
(De Luca & Molendi 2004).

4. The hard particle background (HP, or instrumental back-
ground) consists of a continuum and ﬂuorescence lines. The
continuum is modelled by a (broken) power law, whose pa-
rameters can be constrained using ﬁlter wheel closed obser-
vations, and the lines are modelled by Gaussian functions.
Because this is a particle background, we leave this modelled
component unfolded by the eﬀective area of the CCDs.
5. The quiescent soft-protons (SP) may contribute to the total
emission, even after ﬁltering of the ﬂaring events. This com-
ponent is modelled by a power law with an index varying
typically within 0.7 (cid:46) ΓSP (cid:46) 1.4. Similarly to the HP back-
ground, this component is not folded by the eﬀective area.

The background components have been ﬁrst derived from
spectra covering the total EPIC ﬁeld of view to obtain good con-
straints on their parameters. In particular, this approach allows
us to determine both the mean temperature of the ICM (which is
the dominant emission below ∼2 keV) and the slope of the SP
component (better visible beyond ∼2 keV), while these two pa-
rameters are usually degenerate when only analysing one outer
annulus. In addition to the gdem component, the free parameters

Article number, page 4 of 28

of the background components in the ﬁtted annuli are the nor-
malisations of the HP continuum, HP Gaussian lines (because
their emissivities vary with time and across the detector), and
quiescent SP (beyond 6(cid:48) only).

3.3. Local ﬁts

As discussed extensively in Mernier et al. (2015) and Mernier
et al. (2016a), the abundances measured from a ﬁt covering the
full EPIC energy band may be signiﬁcantly biased, especially for
deep exposure datasets. In fact, a slightly incorrect calibration in
the eﬀective area may result in an incorrect prediction of the
local continuum close to an emission line. Since the abundance
of an ion is directly related to the measured equivalent width of
its corresponding emission lines, a correct estimate of the local
continuum level is crucial to derive accurate abundances.

Therefore, in the rest of the analysis, we measure the O, Mg,
Si, S, Ca, Ar, and Ni abundances by ﬁtting the EPIC spectra
within several narrow energy ranges centred around their K-shell
emission lines (hereafter the "local" ﬁts; Mernier et al. 2016a).
The temperature parameters (kTmean and σT ) are ﬁxed to their
values derived from initial ﬁts performed within the broad en-
ergy band (hereafter the "global" ﬁts). In order to assess the sys-
tematic uncertainties related to remaining cross-calibration is-
sues between the diﬀerent EPIC detectors (Sect. 4.3), we per-
form our local ﬁts in MOS (i.e. the combined MOS 1+MOS 2)
and pn spectra independently. Finally, the Fe abundance can be
measured in EPIC using both the K-shell lines (∼6.4 keV) and
the L-shell line complex (∼0.9–1.2 keV, although not resolved
with CCD instruments). For this reason, in the rest of the paper
we use the global ﬁts to derive the Fe abundances.

4. Building average radial proﬁles

Following the approach of Mernier et al. (2016a), in addition to
the full sample we consider further in this paper, we also split the
sample into two subsamples, namely the "clusters" (23 objects)
and the "groups" (21 objects), for which the mean temperature
within 0.05r500 is greater or lower than 1.7 keV, respectively (see
also Table A.1). One exception is M 87, an elliptical galaxy with
kTmean(0.05r500) = (2.052 ± 0.002) keV, which we treat in the
following as part of the "groups" subsample.

4.1. Exclusion of ﬁtting artefacts

Since little ICM emission is expected at large radii, one may
reasonably expect large statistical uncertainties on our derived
ﬁtting parameters in the outermost annuli of every observation.
In a few speciﬁc cases, however, suspiciously small error bars
are reported at large radii, often together with unphysical best-
ﬁt values. These peculiar measurements are often due to issues
in the ﬁtting process, consequently to bad spectral quality to-
gether with a number of ﬁtted parameters that is too large. Since
these artefact measurements may signiﬁcantly pollute our aver-
age proﬁles, we prefer to discard them from the analysis and
select outer measurements with reasonably large error bars on
their parameters only. To be conservative, we choose to exclude
systematically the Fe abundance measurements showing error
bars smaller than 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 in their 4(cid:48)–6(cid:48), 6(cid:48)–9(cid:48), and
9(cid:48)–12(cid:48) annuli, respectively. A similar ﬁltering is applied to the
other abundances, this time when their measurements show error
bars smaller than 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.07 in their 3(cid:48)–4(cid:48), 4(cid:48)–6(cid:48),
6(cid:48)–9(cid:48), and 9(cid:48)–12(cid:48) annuli, respectively. These discarded artefacts

statistical error (and thus 1/σ2
weights each annulus with re-
X(i) j
spect to its emission measure), N is the number of observations,
depending of the (sub)sample considered, and wi, j,k a weighting
factor. This factor, taking values between 0 and 1, represents the
linear overlapping geometric area fraction of the k-th reference
radial bin on the i-th annulus (belonging to the j-th observation).

4.3. MOS-pn uncertainties

After stacking the measurements as described above, for each
element we are left with Xref, MOS(k) and Xref, pn(k); i.e. an av-
erage MOS and pn abundance proﬁle, respectively, except O,
which could only be measured with the MOS instruments, and
Fe, which we measured in simultaneous EPIC global ﬁts (see
Sect. 3.3). The average EPIC (i.e. combined MOS+pn) proﬁles
are then computed as follows:

represent a marginal fraction (∼4%) of all our data. We list the
maximum radial extend for each cluster and all the elements con-
sidered (rout,X) in Table A.1. Finally, we exclude further speciﬁc
measurements either because their spectral quality could simply
not provide reliable estimates or because of possible contamina-
tion by the AGN emission. These unaccounted annuli are speci-
ﬁed in Table 1.

4.2. Stacking method

Since spectral analysis was performed within annuli of ﬁxed an-
gular sizes regardless of the distances or the cosmological red-
shifts of the sources, care must be taken to build average radial
proﬁles within consistent spatial scales. As commonly used in
the literature, we rescale all the annuli in every object in frac-
tions of r500. We adopted the values of r500, given for each clus-
ter in Table A.1, from Pinto et al. (2015) and references therein.
Another unit widely used in the literature is r180, as it is often
considered (close to) the virial radius of relaxed clusters. Nev-
ertheless, the conversion r500 (cid:39) 0.6r180 is quite straightforward
(e.g. Reiprich et al. 2013).

The number and extent of the reference radial bins of the
average proﬁles are selected such that each bin contains approx-
imately 15–25 individual measurements. The maximum extent
of our reference proﬁles corresponds to the maximum extent
reached by the most distant observation: i.e. 1.22r500 (based on
A 2597) and 0.97r500 (based on A 189) for clusters and groups,
respectively (see Table A.1). After this selection, the average
proﬁles for the full sample and the cluster and group subsamples
contain 16, 9, and 8 reference radial bins, respectively. The outer-
most radial bin of the full sample and the cluster and group sub-
samples contain 17, 16, and 11 individual measurements, which
are located within 0.55–1.22 r500, 0.5–1.22 r500, and 0.26–0.97
r500, respectively. Stacking our individual proﬁles over the refer-
ence bins deﬁned above is not trivial, since some measurements
may share their radial extent with two adjacent reference bins.
To overcome this issue, we employ the method proposed by Lec-
cardi & Molendi (2008). The average abundance proﬁle Xref(k),
as a function of the k-th reference radial bin (deﬁned above), is
obtained as

Xref, EPIC(k) =

where σref, MOS(k) and σref, pn(k) are the statistical errors of
Xref, MOS(k) and Xref, pn(k), respectively. As shown in Mernier
et al. (2016a), abundance estimates using MOS and pn may
sometimes be signiﬁcantly discrepant. Unsurprisingly, we also
ﬁnd MOS-pn discrepancies in some radial bins of our average
abundance proﬁles. We take this systematic eﬀect into account
when combining the MOS and pn proﬁles by increasing the error
bars of the EPIC combined measurements until they cover both
their MOS and pn counterparts.

5. Results

5.1. Fe abundance proﬁle

The average Fe abundance radial proﬁle, measured for the full
sample, is shown in Fig. 1, and the numerical values are detailed
in Table 2. The proﬁle shows a clear decreasing trend with ra-
dius with a maximum at 0.014–0.02r500, and a slight drop be-
low ∼0.01r500. Such a drop is also observed in the Fe proﬁle of
several individual objects (Figs. A.1 and A.2) and is discussed
in Sect. 7.2. The very large total exposure time of the sample
(∼4.5 Ms) makes the combined statistical uncertainties σstat(k)
very small — less than 1% in the core, up to ∼7% in the outer-
most radial bin. The scatter of the measurements (grey shaded
area in Fig. 1), expressed as

(<1.7 keV, green) within our sample. The corresponding shaded areas
show the scatter of the measurements. The two dashed lines indicate
the upper and lower statistical error bars of the Fe proﬁle over the full
sample (Fig. 1) without scatter for clarity.

We now compute the average radial Fe abundance proﬁles
separately for the clusters (>1.7 keV) and groups (<1.7 keV)
of our sample. The result is shown in Fig. 2 (where the dashed
lines indicate the average proﬁle over the full sample) and Ta-
ble 3. The Fe abundance in clusters and groups can be robustly
constrained out to ∼0.9r500 and ∼0.6r500, respectively, and also
show a clear decrease with radius. Although both proﬁles show
a similar slope, we note that at each radius, the average Fe abun-
dance for groups is systematically lower than for clusters. The
two exceptions are the innermost radial bin (where the cluster
and group Fe abundances show consistent values) and the outer-
most radial bin of these two proﬁles (where the group Fe abun-
dances appear somewhat higher than in clusters). We discuss this
further in Sect. 7.1.

Eq. (6) is a power law that is used to model the decrease beyond
(cid:38)0.02r500. To model the inner metal drop, we subtract a Gaussian
(second term) from the power law. The best ﬁt of our empirical
distribution is shown in Fig. 1 (red dashed curve) and can be
expressed as

which provides a reasonable ﬁt to the data (χ2/d.o.f. = 10.3/9).
We also look for possible hints towards a ﬂattening at the out-
skirts. When assuming a positive Fe ﬂoor in the outskirts (by
injecting an additive constant G into Eq. (7)), the ﬁt does not
improve (χ2/d.o.f. = 10.3/10, with G = 0.009) and remains com-
parable to the former case. Therefore, our data do not allow us
to formally conﬁrm the presence of a uniform Fe distribution in
the outskirts. The empirical Fe abundance proﬁle of Eq. (7) is
compared to the radial proﬁles of other elements further in our
analysis (Sect. 5.2).

5.2. Abundance proﬁles of other elements

While the Fe-L and Fe-K complexes, which are both accessible
in the X-ray band, make the Fe abundance rather easy to esti-
mate with a good degree of accuracy, the other elements consid-
ered in this paper (O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Ni) can be measured
by CCD instruments only via their K-shell main emission lines.
Consequently, their radial abundance proﬁles are in general diﬃ-
cult to constrain in the ICM of individual objects. The deep total
exposure of our sample allows us to derive the average radial
abundance proﬁles of elements other than Fe, which we present
in this section.

First, and similarly to Fig. 1, we compute and compare the
radial proﬁles of O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca, averaged over the
full sample. The Ni proﬁle could only be estimated for clusters
because the lower temperature of groups and ellipticals prevents
a clear detection of the Ni K-shell emission lines. These proﬁles
are shown in Fig. 3 and their numerical values can be found in
Table B.1. A question of interest is whether these derived proﬁles
follow the shape of the average Fe proﬁle. This can be checked
by comparing these radial proﬁles to the empirical Fe(r) proﬁle
proposed in Eq. (7) and Fig. 1, shown by the red dashed lines
in Fig. 3. Obviously, the average proﬁle of an element X is not
expected to strictly follow the average Fe proﬁle, as the X/Fe
ratios may be larger or smaller than unity. A more consistent
comparison would be thus to deﬁne the empirical X(r) proﬁles
as

X(r) = ηFe(r) ,

(8)

where η is the average X/Fe ratio estimated using our sample,
within 0.2r500 when possible or 0.05r500 otherwise, and tabulated
in Mernier et al. (2016a, see their Table 2). These normalised
empirical proﬁles are shown by the blue dashed lines in Fig. 3
and can be directly compared with our observational data.

The case of Si is particularly striking, as we ﬁnd a remark-
able agreement (<1σ) between our measurements and the em-
pirical Si(r) proﬁle in all the radial bins, except the outermost
one (<2σ). Within ∼0.5r500, the Ca and Ni proﬁles follow their
empirical counterparts very well (<2σ).

The O, Mg, and S proﬁles are somewhat less consistent with
their respective X(r) proﬁles. The O central drop is signiﬁcantly
more pronounced than the Fe drop, while the Mg proﬁle does not
show any clear central drop and appears signiﬁcantly shallower
than expected (blue dashed line). Finally, the S measured pro-
ﬁle falls somewhat below the empirical prediction within 0.04–
0.1r500. However, such discrepancies are almost entirely intro-
duced by a few speciﬁc observations. As we show further in
Sect. 6.4, when ignoring (temporarily) these single observations
from our sample, a very good agreement is obtained between the
data and empirical proﬁles, both for O, Mg, and S. Moreover, the
large plotted error bars at outer radii in the Mg proﬁle are almost
entirely due to the MOS-pn discrepancies; while the MOS mea-
surements (located at the lower side of the error bars) follow very
well the empirical proﬁle, the pn measurements (located at the
upper side of the error bars) increase with radius; this is probably
because of contamination of the Mg line with the instrumental
Al-Kα line (see Sect. 6.6 for an extended discussion). Finally, as
we show further in this section, the average O/Fe, Mg/Fe, and
S/Fe proﬁles (compiled from O/Fe and Mg/Fe measurements of
individual observations) show a good agreement with being ra-
dially ﬂat.

The case of Ar is the most interesting one. Despite the large
error bars (only covering the MOS-pn discrepancies), the aver-
age radial slope of this element appears systematically steeper

than its empirical proﬁle. A similar behaviour is found in the
average Ar/Fe proﬁle (see further). Unlike the O, Mg, and S pro-
ﬁles, we cannot suppress this overall trend by discarding a few
speciﬁc objects from the sample (Sect. 6.4). Although we dis-
cuss one possible reason for these diﬀerences in Sect. 7.2, we
note that they cannot be conﬁrmed when the scatters are taken
into account.

We also note that in many cases, the average measured abun-
dances in the outermost radial bin are systematically biased low
with respect to the empirical prediction. As we show below, this
feature is also reported in most of the X/Fe proﬁles. While at
these large distances the scatter is very large and still consis-
tent with the empirical expectations, these values that are sys-
tematically lower than expected may emphasise the radial limits
beyond which the background uncertainties prevent any robust
measurement (see Sect. 6.3).

Second, and similarly to Fig. 2, we compute the average O,
Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca abundance proﬁles (and their respective
scatters) for clusters, on the one hand, and for groups, on the
other hand. These proﬁles are shown in Fig. 4 and Table B.2.
For comparison, the average proﬁles using the full sample (Fig.
3, without scatter) are also shown (dashed grey lines). All the
proﬁles (groups and clusters) show an abundance decrease to-
wards the outskirts. Globally, the clusters and groups abundance
proﬁles are very similar for a given element. We note, however,
the exception of the O proﬁles, for which the groups show on av-
erage a lower level of enrichment (similar to the case of Fe). A
drop in the innermost bin for groups is also clearly visible for O
(however, see Sect. 6.4). Moreover, the Ca proﬁle for groups also
suggests a drop in the innermost bin, followed by a more rapidly
declining proﬁle towards the outskirts. While these global trends
are discussed further in Sect. 7.1, we must recall that the large
scatter of our measurements (shaded areas) prevents us from de-
riving any ﬁrm conclusion regarding possible diﬀerences in the
cluster versus group proﬁles presented here.

Another method for comparing the Fe abundance proﬁle
with the abundance proﬁles of other elements is to compute the
X/Fe abundance ratios in each annulus of each individual ob-
servation. We stack all these measurements over the full sam-
ple as described in Sect. 4 to build average X/Fe proﬁles. These
Fe-normalised proﬁles are shown in Fig. 5. In each panel, we
also indicate (X/Fe)core, the average X/Fe ratio measured within
the ICM core (i.e. ≤0.05r500 when possible, ≤0.2r500 otherwise)
adopted from Mernier et al. (2016a), and their total uncertain-
ties (dotted horizontal lines; including the statistical errors, in-
trinsic scatter, and MOS-pn uncertainties). As mentioned earlier,
the Ni/Fe proﬁle could only be reasonably derived for clusters.
Despite a usually large scatter (in particular in the outskirts), the
X/Fe proﬁles are all in agreement with being ﬂat, hence follow-
ing the Fe average proﬁle, and are globally consistent with their
respective average (X/Fe)core values. Despite this global agree-
ment, we note the clear drop of Ar/Fe beyond ∼0.064r500. This
outer drop corresponds to the steeper Ar proﬁle seen in Fig. 3
and reported above. Finally, and similarly to Fig 3, most of the
outermost average X/Fe values are biased low with respect to
their (X/Fe)core counterparts (often coupled with very large scat-
ters), perhaps indicating the observational limits of measuring
these ratios.

on the ICM enrichment, we must ensure that our results are ro-
bust and do not (strongly) depend on the assumptions we invoke
throughout this paper. In this section, we explore the systematic
uncertainties that could potentially aﬀect our results. They can
arise from: (i) the intrinsic scatter in the radial proﬁles of the dif-
ferent objects of our sample; (ii) MOS-pn discrepancies in the
abundance measurements due to residual EPIC cross-calibration
issues; (iii) projection eﬀects on the plane of the sky; (iv) un-
certainties in the thermal structure of the ICM; (v) uncertainties
in the background modelling; and (vi) the weight of a few indi-
vidual highest quality observations, which might dominate the
average measurements.

We already took items (i) and (ii) taken into account in our
analysis (Sect. 5.1 and 4.3, respectively), and here we focus on
items (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi).

6.1. Projection effects

Throughout this paper, we report the average abundance proﬁles
of the ICM as observed by XMM-Newton/EPIC, i.e. projected
on the plane of the sky. Several models are currently available

the ICM distribution, which may not always be true. Moreover,
some methods are known for introducing artefacts in the depro-
jected measurements (for a comparison, see Russell et al. 2008),
as deprojection methods assume a dependency between all the
ﬁtted annuli. We thus prefer to work with projected results to
keep a statistical independence in the radial bins.

Several past works investigated the eﬀects of deprojection on
the abundance estimates at diﬀerent radii. The general outcome
is that these eﬀects have a very limited impact on the abundance
measurements (e.g. Rasmussen & Ponman 2007; Russell et al.
2008). Therefore, we do not expect them to be a source of sig-
niﬁcant systematic uncertainty for the purpose of this work.

6.2. Thermal modelling

As explained in Sect. 3.1, the abundance determination is very
sensitive to the assumed thermal structure of the cluster/group.
Therefore, it is crucial to ﬁt our spectra with a thermal model
that reproduces the projected temperature structure as realisti-
cally as possible. In particular, a cie (single-temperature) model
is clearly not optimal for our analysis. The thermal model used
in this work (gdem) has been used in many previous studies
and is thought to be rather successful at reproducing the true
temperature structure of some clusters (e.g. Simionescu et al.
2009; Frank et al. 2013), as it represents one of the simplest
way of accounting for a continuous mixing of temperatures in
the ICM (coming from either projection eﬀects or a locally in-
trinsic multi-phase plasma). The precise temperature distribution
is however diﬃcult to determine with the current spectrometers
and may somewhat diﬀer from the gdem assumption. Alterna-
tively, some previous works suggest that the temperature dis-
tribution in cool-core clusters may be reasonably approximated
by a truncated power law (typically between 0.2 keV (cid:46) kT (cid:46)
3 keV, with more emission towards higher temperatures; see e.g.
Kaastra et al. 2004; Sanders et al. 2008). Such a distribution can
be modelled in SPEX via the wdem model (for more details, see
e.g. Kaastra et al. 2004).

Using a wdem model instead of a gdem model can potentially
lead to diﬀerences in the measured abundances, hence contribut-
ing to add further systematic uncertainties to the derived pro-
ﬁles (for a RGS comparison, see de Plaa et al. 2017). Unfor-
tunately, the large computing time required by the wdem model
in the ﬁts does not allow us to perform a full comparison be-
tween the two models over the whole sample. We thus select one
cluster, MKW 3s, and we explore how the use of a wdem model
aﬀects its Fe proﬁle. MKW 3s has the advantage of emitting a
moderate ICM temperature (∼3.4 keV) inside 0.05r500, which is
very close to the mean temperature of the clusters in the sam-
ple (∼3.2 keV) within this radius. Moreover, the Fe radial proﬁle
of MKW 3s (Fig. A.1) is rather similar to the average Fe pro-
ﬁle presented in Fig. 1. The gdem-wdem comparison on the Fe
radial proﬁle of MKW 3s is presented in Fig. 6. The use of a
wdem model in MKW 3s systematically predicts higher Fe abun-
dances than using a gdem model, where the increase may vary
from +6% (core) up to +20% (outskirts). Since there is a diﬀer-
ence of temperature between the core (kTmean (cid:39) 3.5 keV) and
the outskirts (kTmean (cid:39) 1 keV), this may suggest a temperature
dependence (see also de Plaa et al. 2017). However, there is no
substantial change in the slope of the overall proﬁle. The same
trend is also found for the abundance proﬁles of the other el-
ements. For comparison, we also check that we obtain similar
results for NGC 507, i.e. a cooler group. In conclusion, we do
not expect any variation in the shape of the average abundance
proﬁles owing to the use of another temperature distribution in

Fig. 6. Comparison of the radial Fe proﬁles derived in MKW 3s by as-
suming successively a Gaussian (gdem, black) and a power law (wdem,
red) temperature distribution (see text for more details).

our modelling. The normalisation of these proﬁles, which might
slightly be revised upwards in the case of a wdem model, still lies
within the scatter of our measurements and does not aﬀect our
results.

Nevertheless, as said above, it is worth keeping in mind that
the current spectral resolution oﬀered by CCDs does not allow
us to resolve the precise temperature structure in the ICM. Fur-
ther improvements on the thermal assumptions invoked here are
expected with X-ray micro-calorimeter spectrometers on board
future missions.

6.3. Background uncertainties

As mentioned in Sect. 3.2, a proper modelling of the background
is crucial for a correct determination of the abundances in the
ICM. This is especially true in the outskirts, where the back-
ground contribution is signiﬁcant and may easily introduce sys-
tematic biases when deriving spectral properties. Presumably,
the Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni abundances are more sensitive to
the modelling of the non-X-ray background, as the HP and SP
components dominate beyond ∼2 keV. On the other hand, the
O abundance is more sensitive to the X-ray background, in par-
ticular the GTE and LHB components, which may have their
greatest inﬂuence below ∼1 keV. We investigate the eﬀects of
background-related uncertainties on the abundance proﬁles us-
ing two diﬀerent approaches.

First, similar to Sect. 6.2, we take MKW 3s as an object rep-
resentative of the whole sample. In each annulus and for all the
EPIC instruments, we successively ﬁx the normalisations of the
HP and SP background components to ±10% of their best-ﬁt
values. We then reﬁt the spectra and measure the changes in the
best-ﬁt Si and Fe proﬁles. We do the same for the O proﬁle, this
time by ﬁxing the normalisations of the GTE and LHB com-
ponents together to ±10% of their best-ﬁt values. The results
are shown in the left panel of Fig. 7, where the Si and Fe pro-
ﬁles were shifted up for clarity. In all cases, the changes in the
best-ﬁt abundances are smaller than (or similar to) the statisti-
cal uncertainties from our initial ﬁts. This clearly illustrates that
a slightly ((cid:46)10%) incorrect scaling of the modelled background
has a limited impact on our results, even at large radii. Moreover,
we may reasonably expect that the possible deviations from the

true normalisation of the background components average out
when stacking all the objects.

Second, and despite the encouraging previous indication that
the background-related systematic uncertainties are under con-
trol, we still consider the possibility that the outer regions of
every observation would be too contaminated and should be dis-
carded from the analysis. In this respect, in the right panel of Fig.
7 we rebuild the average Fe proﬁle by successively ignoring the
≥9(cid:48), ≥6(cid:48), and ≥4(cid:48) regions (corresponding to keeping only the ﬁrst
seven, six, and ﬁve annuli, respectively) from each observation.
Restricting our analysis to <6(cid:48) still allows us to derive a mean Fe
abundance in the outermost average radial bin (0.55–1.22r500).
However, most of the area from the only two measurements that
partly fall into this bin (A 2597 and A 1991) overlap the inner
reference bin (0.3–0.55r500). This spatial resolution issue may
thus explain the slight (∼30%, albeit non-signiﬁcant) increase of
the average Fe value observed in outermost bin when truncating
the ≥6(cid:48) regions. A similar explanation can be invoked for the
<4(cid:48) case, in the second outermost bin (0.3–0.55r500), where an
average increase of ∼12% is observed (though less than 2σ sig-
niﬁcant). In any case, the changes related to the truncation of the
proﬁles at diﬀerent radii are always smaller than the scatter (grey
area) even in the outskirts. Therefore, this scatter can reasonably
be seen as a conservative limit encompassing all the background
uncertainties mentioned here.

In summary, our results clearly suggest that our careful mod-
elling of the background allows us to keep all its related sys-
tematic uncertainties on the abundances under control, even at
larger radii. However, it is not impossible that the background
dominates in the outermost radial bin (≥ 0.55r500) too much,
thereby biasing low the average abundances of some elements
(Sect. 5.2).

6.4. Weight of individual observations

Among the 44 objects of our sample, the three brightest objects
(A 3526 a.k.a. Centaurus, M 87, and Perseus) beneﬁt from ex-
cellent data quality, leading to very small statistical uncertain-
ties (σ2
) of their measured abundances. Consequently, these
observations may have an important contribution in shaping the

(cid:29) 1). The consequences

X(i) j

In Fig. 8 (top left panel), we show how the average Fe proﬁle
changes when we exclude A 3526, M 87, and Perseus from the
sample. Compared to the initial Fe proﬁle (blue empty boxes;
see also Fig 1), the largest eﬀect is an increase of ∼8% in the
innermost average radial bin (≤ 7.5 × 10−3r500), while the rest of
the radial proﬁle varies a few per cent at most.

Similarly, this weighting eﬀect may aﬀect the other abun-
dance proﬁles. In Fig. 3, we showed that the average Si, Ca, and
Ni radial proﬁles follow very well the ﬁtted average Fe radial
proﬁle normalised by the average X/Fe ratio found in the core.
However, the innermost region (≤0.01r500) shows an O drop
about ∼20% lower than predicted by our empirical proﬁle, while
the Mg proﬁle looks signiﬁcantly ﬂatter than expected. Similarly,
some deviations from the expected S proﬁle are also observed
within 0.04–0.1r500. In this section, we show that these proﬁles
are more aﬀected by the weight of a few individual observations,
and that the empirical O/Mg/S proﬁles can be very well repro-
duced when temporarily ignoring these peculiar measurements.
When we exclude M 49, M 60, and NGC 4636 from the anal-
ysis, we ﬁnd a much better agreement between the O abundance
and its corresponding empirical prediction in the innermost bin
(Fig. 8, top right panel). Indeed, these three ellipticals/groups are
characterised by a suspiciously low O abundance within their re-
spective <0.5(cid:48) annuli (inconsistent with the values found within
0.8(cid:48) with RGS by de Plaa et al. 2017), which, together with very
small errors bars, contribute to substantially lower the average O
abundance in the ≤ 7.5 × 10−3r500 region.

When we exclude Perseus from the analysis, the average
Mg measurements agree much better with the expected empir-
ical proﬁle, especially within ∼0.01–0.05r500 (Fig. 8, bottom
left panel). The signiﬁcant MOS-pn discrepancies measured in
the Perseus spectra make the Mg abundance somewhat uncer-
tain over the region considered above. However, and coinciden-
tally, combining these (discrepant) MOS/pn measurements from
Perseus with those from the rest of the sample brings the average
MOS and pn estimates of Mg at very similar levels, thereby dra-
matically reducing the total MOS-pn uncertainties that we con-
sider in Sect. 4.3. This case is thus a good illustration that care

must be taken when combining individual systematic uncertain-
ties over a large data sample. Finally, the exclusion of NGC 1550
and Perseus from the sample contributes to a better agreement
of the measured S proﬁle with its empirical expectation (Fig. 8,
bottom right panel).

To sum up, in addition to showing that the average measured
radial abundance proﬁles for all elements can reproduce very
well their empirical counterparts, this section illustrates that care
must be taken when strictly interpreting the error bars shown in
the ﬁgures of this paper, as only one or two individual obser-
vations may slightly (usually, within a few per cent) but signif-
icantly raise or lower our measurements. That said, in the rest
of the paper we consider our full sample, including the peculiar
measurements discussed here.

6.5. Atomic code uncertainties

The CIE model employed to ﬁt our EPIC spectra is based on
the MEKAL model (Mewe et al. 1985, 1986, also present in
XSPEC), with important updates up to now. The atomic database
and routines on which this model relies is called SPEXACT5.

5 SPEX Atomic Code and Tables

Whereas the initial version of SPEXACT can be simply at-
tributed to the original MEKAL model, the version used in this
work (corresponding to the atomic code that was regularly up-
dated between 1996 and 2016) is referred to SPEXACT v2. In
recent months, substantial eﬀorts have been devoted towards a
major update of the code (SPEXACT v3), followed by a newly
released version of SPEX (see also de Plaa et al. 2017). For
example, this new version includes a more precise parametrisa-
tion of the radiative recombination rates (Mao & Kaastra 2016),
updated collisional ionisation coeﬃcients (Urdampilleta et al.
2017), and the calculation of many more transitions. Following
Mernier et al. (2016a), we included the correction of this latest
update on our O abundance measurements (Sect. 3.1). However
the abundances of the other elements may also be aﬀected by
such improved calculations.

Unfortunately, ﬁtting all our EPIC spectra using SPEXACT
v3 would require unrealistic amounts of computing time and re-
sources. Therefore, we evaluate the impact of these atomic code
diﬀerences on the EPIC abundances by following a similar ap-
proach as carried out by de Plaa et al. (2017) for RGS. Here, we
simulate EPIC spectra assuming a gdem distribution calculated
from SPEXACT v3, for a range of mean temperatures from 0.6
keV to 6.0 keV and by setting all the abundances to 1. We then

foreground may play a more important role than expected, which
can potentially bias the O abundance, especially when the back-
ground dominates. Although aﬀecting on average 3–4% of the
XMM-Newton observations, solar wind charge exchange might
also be a source of (limited) bias for the O abundance, at it may
aﬀect the O vii and O viii lines in the contaminated spectra (e.g.
Snowden et al. 2004; Carter et al. 2011).

On the other hand, the main K-shell emission line of Mg
(∼1.5 keV rest-frame) falls partly into the Fe-L complex, which
is unresolved by the EPIC instruments. Moreover, measuring the
Mg abundance in clusters outskirts is challenging because the
EPIC hard particle background is contaminated by the Al Kα ﬂu-
orescence line, which is also situated at ∼1.5 keV both in MOS
and pn instruments (e.g. Mernier et al. 2015), and thus impossi-
ble to disentangle from the Mg K-shell ICM emission lines using
the EPIC spectrometers.

Despite all these limitations, the good agreement of our aver-
age O and Mg proﬁles with their respective empirical predictions
(at least out to ∼0.3r500, and after discarding speciﬁc observa-
tions from the sample, see Sect. 6.4) is very encouraging, and
makes us conﬁdent about the results presented in this work.

7. Discussion

We derived the average radial abundance proﬁles of 44 galaxy
clusters, groups, and elliptical galaxies. In Sect. 5, we were able
to provide constraints on the radial ICM distributions of Fe, but
also O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Ni, comparing them within clus-
ters (>1.7 keV) and groups (<1.7 keV). In the previous section,
we also showed that the major systematic uncertainties are kept
under control. We now discuss our results and we compare them
with measurements and predictions from previous studies.

7.1. Enrichment in clusters and groups

In Fig. 2, we compared the radial Fe abundance proﬁle averaged
over clusters, on the one hand, and groups, on the other hand.
Although the scatter in each proﬁle is large, the average enrich-
ment level in clusters is slightly higher than in groups. This re-
sult is not surprising, as an increase of the ICM metallicity with
the cluster/group temperature (at least up to kT (cid:39) 3 keV) has
been commonly observed in previous studies (e.g. Rasmussen
& Ponman 2009; Yates et al. 2017). This trend is also consis-
tent with the results of Mernier et al. (2016a), who analysed the
same sample with the same data and same deﬁnition for clus-
ters versus groups/ellipticals. They found that, within 0.05r500,
the Fe abundance in clusters is on average ∼22% higher than in
groups. We ﬁnd a similar Fe enhancement (on average ∼21%)
in our proﬁles for clusters and groups at all radii, except in their
respective innermost and outermost radial bins (see also Sect.
5.1). The absence of diﬀerence of Fe abundance in the inner-
most bin of clusters and groups can be explained by the impor-
tant weight of a few individual clusters, as already discussed in
Sect. 6.4. In particular, the cores of Perseus and A 3526 show
deep and signiﬁcant Fe drops (see also Sect. 7.2), which tend to
lower the innermost average Fe abundance for clusters. Remov-
ing these two objects from the sample increases this innermost
Fe abundance (Fig. 8, top left panel), and, therefore, should con-
tribute towards keeping a similar enhancement between clusters
and groups within ∼0.01r500. On the other hand, among the 11
measurements in the outermost radial bin of the groups proﬁle,
only 2 (∼18%) are located beyond 0.5r500, i.e. covering the out-
ermost bin of the clusters proﬁle. The Fe abundance averaged

ﬁt these mock spectra locally with a gdem model calculated from
SPEXACT v2 (i.e. the version used in this work), and we mea-
sure the changes in the best-ﬁt abundances. The result is shown
in Fig. 9.

For temperatures hotter than ∼1.5 keV, most of the abun-
dances do not change by more than ∼20%. The two exceptions
are Mg and Ni, which can change by almost a factor of 2 at high
and low temperatures, respectively. For temperatures cooler than
∼1.5 keV, we see a dramatic decrease (by more than a factor of
2) of the measured Fe abundance. The main diﬀerence between
the spectral models generated by SPEXACT v2 and SPEXACT
v3 resides in the Fe-L complex, which is foremost used by the
ﬁts to determine the Fe abundance in cool (kT (cid:46) 2 keV) plasmas.
Since most of the computed abundances remain fairly con-
stant within the typical temperature range (∼1–5 keV) of all the
spectra of our sample, such atomic code uncertainties are not
expected to aﬀect our results. Nevertheless, we note that these
changes between SPEXACT v2 and SPEXACT v3 may have a
non-negligible impact on the integrated abundances (and X/Fe
abundance ratios) reported in previous works. For instance, if up-
dated atomic calculations indeed revise the average Ni/Fe abun-
dance downwards (so far measured to be surprisingly high; e.g.
Mernier et al. 2016a,b), a more simple agreement than previ-
ously assumed between the ICM abundance pattern and SN yield
models may be expected. This issue (and further use of SPEX-
ACT v3 on real cluster data) will be discussed extensively in a
forthcoming paper.

6.6. Instrumental limitations for O and Mg abundances

Finally, we must warn that the EPIC instruments have limitations
in deriving accurate O and Mg abundances.

The main K-shell transitions of O (∼0.6 keV rest-frame) are
situated close to the oxygen absorption edge, and the interstel-
lar absorption may aﬀect the O abundance determination, as the
EPIC spectral resolution cannot resolve the emission and absorp-
tion features within this band (see e.g. de Plaa et al. 2004). More-
over, and despite our considerations from Sect. 6.3, the Galactic

over this outermost bin of the groups proﬁle is thus weighted to-
wards the measurements at smaller radii, roughly at the location
of the third (<0.34r500) and second (0.34–0.5r500) outermost bins
of the clusters proﬁle. This explains the illusion of a Fe enhance-
ment in the outskirts of groups with respect to those of clusters.
In summary, the average Fe proﬁle of clusters is consistent
with being more enhanced in a similar way not only in the core,
but also at all radial distances at least out to 0.5r500. The origin
of such a diﬀerence of ICM enrichment between cooler and hot-
ter objects is still unclear, and has been already debated in the
literature (e.g. Rasmussen & Ponman 2009; Liang et al. 2016;
Yates et al. 2017). For example, in contrast to clusters, galaxy
groups may not be closed boxes (e.g. McCarthy et al. 2011) and
AGN feedback may contribute to remove enriched material out
of the groups. It may even be possible that part of this appar-
ent diﬀerence of enrichment could be due to underestimated Fe
abundances in low temperature plasmas, as mentioned in Sect.
6.5. A thorough discussion of these aspects is somewhat beyond
the scope of this paper. However, our radial proﬁles may provide
useful constraints on the dominant mechanisms that are respon-
sible for such a diﬀerence.

Interestingly, the same trend between clusters and groups is
not clearly observed in the average proﬁles of other elements. In-
stead, these abundance proﬁles are consistent within clusters and
groups (Fig. 4). In fact, we report a slight (but not signiﬁcant) en-
hancement in the X/Fe ratio proﬁles of groups compared to those
of clusters, up to 0.03r500, whose eﬀect is visible in the Si/Fe and
S/Fe proﬁles of the full sample (Fig. 5). However, the large er-
ror bars (including systematic uncertainties from the MOS-pn
cross-calibration) prevent us from ﬁrmly conﬁrming this trend.
We also note the exception of the O proﬁles, which clearly show
an enhancement in the case of clusters with respect to that of
groups. However, we must recall that O measurements using
EPIC may be still uncertain (Sect. 6.6). Moreover, the measured
O abundance in hotter systems may be biased high compared to
its true value, essentially owing to issues in determining the cor-
rect continuum coupled to the weak emissivity of the O viii line
at these temperatures (Rasia et al. 2008).

7.2. Central metallicity drop

As seen in Figs. A.1 and A.2, some clusters and groups clearly
exhibit a central drop in their Fe abundances. The presence of
drops in these systems also appear in Fig. 1, where a slight cen-
tral decrease is observed in the average Fe abundance proﬁle.
Figures 3 and 5 suggest that these drops are not exclusive to Fe,
as the other metals seem to be concerned. In this section, we at-
tempt to quantify these abundance drops (focussing mainly on
Fe) and then discuss their possible origins.

One way of quantifying the Fe drops is to measure their
"depths". We choose arbitrarily the quantity Fe(rmax)/Fedrop: we
divide the Fe abundance at its oﬀ-centre peak (or the Fe abun-
dance at its second innermost bin, if the proﬁle is monoton-
ically decreasing) by the Fe abundance at the ﬁrst innermost
bin. With this deﬁnition, all the objects with Fe(rmax)/Fedrop sig-
niﬁcantly greater than 1 are considered to host a signiﬁcant
drop. We ﬁnd that 14 objects (∼32%) of our sample show a de-
crease of Fe abundance in their very core. Three of these objects
(2A 0335+096, A 3526, and Perseus) are classiﬁed as clusters
(i.e. ∼13% of the subsample), while the remaining 11 (A 189,
A 3581, Fornax, HCG 62, M 49, M 86, NGC 4325, NGC 4636,
NGC 5044, NGC 5813, and NGC 5846) are classiﬁed as groups
(i.e. ∼52% of the subsample). This apparent larger proportion of
groups hosting a central metallicity drop should be treated with

Fig. 10. Depth of the central Fe drop (Fe(rmax)/Fedrop) vs. location of the
Fe oﬀ-centre maximum (rmax/r500) for all the objects of our sample. A
value Fe(rmax)/Fedrop (cid:46) 1 (grey area below the dotted horizontal line)
means that no Fe drop could be signiﬁcantly detected and only upper
limits of rmax/r500 could be estimated.

caution because the larger distance of many clusters does not
allow us to investigate their very core with the same spatial res-
olution as for nearer groups and ellipticals. Similarly, the drop
seen in the average Fe proﬁle (Fig. 1) is smoothed by the lower
spatial resolution of more distant systems, and thus appears less
pronounced than in individual nearby objects.

In most cases, the Fe drop is only seen in the innermost
bin. However, some objects (e.g. Perseus, Fornax, M 49, and
NGC 5044) clearly exhibit a drop extending within several ra-
dial bins. Therefore, for each object we also evaluate rmax/r500,
i.e. the location of the (oﬀ-centre) Fe peak, in units of r500. For
objects not showing any apparent drop, we adopt the extent of
the innermost bin, which only provides an upper limit. Figure
10 shows a diagram of Fe(rmax)/Fedrop versus rmax/r500 (i.e. the
depth of the drops versus the location of the Fe oﬀ-centre peaks).
The grey shaded area corresponds to the objects with no appar-
ent drop (Fe(rmax)/Fedrop ≤ 1), where only an upper limit of
rmax/r500 could be constrained. When restricting ourselves to the
objects exhibiting a drop (white area), we do not ﬁnd evidence
for a clear correlation (ρ (cid:39) 0.19) between the depth and radial
extent of the drops. In fact, the error bars and scatter of the mea-
surements are quite large and prevent us from deriving any ﬁrm
conclusion on this assessment. The ACIS instrument on board
Chandra could help to reduce the error bars and to conﬁrm (or
rule out) this correlation. Such a detailed study, however, is be-
yond the scope of this present paper, and we leave it for future
work.

This is not the ﬁrst time that central metallicity drops have
been found in the core of the ICM (e.g. Sanders & Fabian 2002;
Johnstone et al. 2002; Sanders & Fabian 2007; Raﬀerty et al.
2013). However, their interpretation is not yet established. Below
we discuss several possibilities that could explain the metallicity
drops found in this work.

First, these apparent drops in metallicity could be the result
of an artefact when ﬁtting the spectra of the central regions. For
example, an inappropriate modelling of the X-ray emission of
the central AGN (or cumulated X-ray binaries in the BCG) could
potentially introduce an incorrect estimate of the continuum of
the ICM emission and underestimate the abundances in the very

core. However, the abundance decrease extends sometimes out-
side the innermost region (Fig. A.2, see e.g. Fornax, M 49, and
NGC 5044), where no contamination from AGN emission is ex-
pected. Similarly (and perhaps more interestingly), the presence
of non-thermal electrons in X-ray cavities could produce an
additional power law component, which would underestimate
the abundances if not properly modelled. However, we would
then expect a good match between cavities extents (and mor-
phologies) and abundance drops, which is not actually observed
(Panagoulia et al. 2015; Sanders et al. 2016). Another possibility
would be that the abundances measured in the very core suﬀer
from the Fe/Si/S-bias (e.g. Buote 2000) owing to too simple as-
sumptions concerning the thermal modelling. While accounting
for a multi-temperature structure may sometimes help to remove
the abundance drop (e.g. in 2A 0335+096; Werner et al. 2006b),
this is not necessarily true for all the sources (e.g. Sanders et al.
2004; Panagoulia et al. 2013). Moreover, we must recall that all
our spectra are ﬁtted with a gdem model, which already assumes
a multi-phase plasma. As a test, we also checked that the use of
a wdem model does not remove the central drop in A 3526. We
admit, however, that a better knowledge of the true temperature
distribution in cooling cores would be required to investigate in
detail its impact on the very central abundance measurements.
We can also discard other artiﬁcial eﬀects such as projection
on the plane of the sky (Sanders & Fabian 2007) or resonant
scattering (Sanders & Fabian 2006b), since they are not eﬃcient
enough to fully remove the drops. Finally, the underestimate of
the Fe abundance at CCD resolution for low temperatures (Sect.
6.5) could be an alternative ﬁtting bias to explain the abundance
drops. Although this could explain some abundance drops found
in very cool group cores (e.g. NGC 5813), this bias can hardly
be invoked in the case of core temperatures above ∼1 keV still
exhibiting a drop (e.g. A 3526).

Second, assuming that the drops are real, it may be reason-
able to speculate that a fraction of the central metal mass has
been redistributed from the core, by either AGN feedback, or
sloshing motions. Whereas it is now well established that AGN
feedback may play a key role in transporting the metals out-
side of the very core via jets and/or buoyant bubbles, as al-
ready observed in M 87 (Simionescu et al. 2008) and in Hydra A
(Simionescu et al. 2009), simulations do not favour any clear for-
mation of inner drops (e.g. Guo & Mathews 2010). Furthermore,
we do not ﬁnd any correlation between AGN radio luminosities
(L1.4 GHz) reported in the literature (e.g. Bîrzan et al. 2012) and
the depths (Fe(rmax)/Fedrop) or the radial extent (rmax/r500) of the
drops in our sample. Similarly, while the extended drop seen in
NGC 5044 might be partly explained by its peculiar metal distri-
bution in the sloshed gas (O’Sullivan et al. 2014), sloshing pro-
cess can probably not explain the (narrower) drops seen in other
objects (Roediger et al. 2011, 2012).

Third, and alternatively, the drops could be the result of the
depletion of a part of the ICM-phase metals into dust grains.
In the scenario proposed by Panagoulia et al. (2013, 2015), a
signiﬁcant part of the metals released by SNe within the BCG
remain in the form of cold dust grains (Voit & Donahue 2011)
and become incorporated into the central dusty ﬁlaments. These
dust grains are then dragged out by buoyant bubbles caused by
the AGN activity and are released back in the hot ICM phase
out of the very core, thereby forming the oﬀ-centre Fe peak.
This idea is supported by the presence of dust in most of the
objects studied by Panagoulia et al. (2015) and showing a metal-
licity drop. The authors emphasise that such a scenario can be
tested by the behaviour of the Ne and Ar radial proﬁle in the
very core of clusters and groups. Indeed, while elements like Fe,

Article number, page 16 of 28

Si, and S are known to be easily embedded in dust grains, Ne
and Ar are noble gases and are not expected to be incorporated
into dust6. Consequently, their radial abundance proﬁles should
not show any sign of drop or ﬂattening in the innermost regions.
As mentioned in Sect. 3.1, the EPIC spectral resolution does not
allow us to investigate the Ne radial distribution. Interestingly,
the radial Ar distribution does not follow well the (rescaled) Fe
distribution as it shows a sharper gradient than expected by the
empirical Fe proﬁle (Figs. 3 and 5). This sharper gradient is
consistent with the diﬀerent average Ar/Fe ratios measured by
Mernier et al. (2016b) in the ≤0.05r500 and the ≤0.2r500 regions.
Similarly, the central ((cid:46) 0.02r500) measured Ar abundances lie
somewhat higher than expected. As an (speculative) explanation
for this particular feature seen only in the Ar proﬁle, dust de-
pletion in the cool-core ICM (presumably aﬀecting all the con-
sidered elements, except Ar) might play a substantial role in
shaping the abundance proﬁles of depleted elements, in partic-
ular within ∼0.1r500. However, our average Ar proﬁle points to-
wards the presence of a ﬂattening (if not a drop) in the inner-
most bin (Fig. 3), suggesting that dust depletion only may not
be suﬃcient to explain the innermost metal drops. That said, the
very large scatter of the Ar abundance prevents us from claim-
ing any ﬁrm evidence for/against this scenario. When investi-
gating the individual abundance proﬁles of Perseus and A 3526
(i.e. the two objects hosting an abundance drop and providing
the best statistics), as shown in Fig. 11, we ﬁnd that the MOS
measurements in A 3526 suggest a monotonic increase of Ar to-
wards the centre. The other measurements (pn in A 3526, and
MOS and pn in Perseus) instead suggest that Ar follows the Fe
drop. To summarise, although we are not able to ﬁrmly favour
or rule out this dust depletion scenario, our results might suggest
a non-negligible eﬀect of dust depletion of gas-phase metals in
clusters, but do not conﬁrm that metals that are embedded in dust
in the very core of clusters/groups would be the unique origin of
the abundance drops.

Fourth, the apparent drops may be the result of an underesti-
mate of the helium content in the very core of such objects. Be-
cause He transitions do not occur at X-ray energies, it is impos-
sible to provide any direct constraint on the He abundance in the
ICM. In all our ﬁts (as in the majority of the similar studies found
in the literature), we assume that He follows the primordial abun-
dance (∼25% of mass fraction; e.g. Peimbert et al. 2016). How-
ever, the large gravitational potential in the core of clusters and
groups may be eﬃcient in retaining He, which could be more
centrally peaked than H (Fabian & Pringle 1977; Abramopoulos
et al. 1981). If we eﬀectively underestimate the He abundance in
our ﬁts of the core region, the net continuum would be overes-
timated, resulting in a bias of all our metal abundances towards
lower values (e.g. Ettori & Fabian 2006). We illustrate this ef-
fect in Fig. 12, where we assume the He abundance in our ﬁts of
the innermost bin of A 3526 to be successively 1.25, 1.5, 1.75,
2, 2.25, and 2.50 times the primordial value. As can be seen, a
He abundance that is 1.5 higher than previously assumed in the
ICM core is suﬃcient to remove the inner Fe drop signiﬁcantly.
However, recent models point towards a less important He sed-
imentation in the very centre of cool-core clusters than in their
surroundings (∼0.4–0.8r500; Peng & Nagai 2009). Moreover, as
already noted by Panagoulia et al. (2015), thermal diﬀusion may
also play an important role in counteracting He sedimentation
and in removing He and other metals (including Fe) out of the

6 Dusty Ar might appear in the form of cold molecular gas 36ArH+
(Barlow et al. 2013), but the presence of such a gas in cluster cores still
remains highly uncertain.

happen in hot and massive clusters, where the ICM pressure is
high enough. Instead, we ﬁnd metal drops for a large portion of
less massive objects.

7.3. The overall Fe proﬁle

7.3.1. Comparison with previous measurements

The average Fe radial proﬁle of our full sample (Fig. 1) can
be compared to other average proﬁles reported in the litera-
ture. Leccardi & Molendi (2008) measured radial metallicity
proﬁles for a sample of 48 hot ((cid:38)3.3 keV) intermediate red-
shift (0.1 (cid:46) z (cid:46) 0.3) clusters using XMM-Newton. Similar
studies for nearby cool-core clusters have been carried out by
Sanderson et al. (2009, Chandra, z < 0.1) and Matsushita (2011,
XMM-Newton, z < 0.08). Finally, Rasmussen & Ponman (2007)
measured radial metallicity proﬁles for a sample of 15 nearby
galaxy groups using Chandra. Figure 13 illustrates the compari-
son between our measurements and the three sample-based stud-
ies mentioned above. The choice of the reference (solar or proto-
solar) abundance tables often varies in the literature; the most
commonly used is Anders & Grevesse (1989). Before comparing
the proﬁles, all the abundances were rescaled to the proto-solar
values of Lodders et al. (2009) used in this work.

As seen in the left panel of Fig. 13 (clusters), our Fe abun-
dance proﬁle is in excellent agreement with the measured pro-
ﬁles of Sanderson et al. (2009) and Matsushita (2011). Only the
second outermost bin of the proﬁle of Matsushita (2011) devi-
ates from our values by <2σ, while all the other radial bins of
these two proﬁles are 1σ consistent with our measurements. The
two innermost bins of the average proﬁle of Leccardi & Molendi
(2008), however, have signiﬁcantly lower Fe abundances than
this study. This can be easily explained, as the sample of Lec-
cardi & Molendi (2008) contains both cool-core and non-cool-
core clusters. Because of their substantially less steep abundance
decrease (Sect. 1), including non-cool-core clusters in a sam-
ple naturally ﬂattens its average metallicity proﬁle. Interestingly
(and encouragingly), the four compared proﬁles agree very well
beyond ∼0.15r500 up to their respective outermost bins. This, to-
gether with the limited Fe scatter in the outermost radial bins of
this work, may suggest a universal metallicity distribution out-
side cluster cores. We note that, however, from the 17 cool-core
objects of the sample of Matsushita (2011), 13 are present in
our sample as well (including M 87). Very similar abundance
proﬁles were thus expected, even at the cluster outskirts. Nev-
ertheless, none of the clusters from the sample of Leccardi &
Molendi (2008) are also present in our sample, and the very sim-
ilar average abundance (∼0.2–0.3) found beyond ∼0.5r500 for
both nearby and intermediate redshift clusters is clearly an inter-
esting result. Finally, the average Fe abundance measured in this
work is fully consistent with the (large but conservative) limits
at r180 ((cid:39) 1.7r500) established by Molendi et al. (2016).

The right panel of Fig. 13 (groups) shows a comparison be-
tween our average Fe abundance proﬁle for groups and the av-
erage proﬁle derived by Rasmussen & Ponman (2007). There is
an overlap of six groups between the two samples. While the
results agree below 0.01r500 and within 0.07–0.2r500, disagree-
ments can be seen elsewhere. Within 0.01–0.07r500, the Ras-
mussen & Ponman (2007) abundances are <2σ consistent with
our average groups proﬁle. However, the authors detect a deep
average central abundance drop, which does not appear in our
stacked proﬁle. This diﬀerence may be explained by the large
variety of metallicity proﬁles within the very core of groups, as
seen in Fig. A.2 and in Rasmussen & Ponman (2007, see their

very core of clusters (Medvedev et al. 2014; see also Berlok &
Pessah 2016a,b). Nevertheless, the relative importance of ther-
mal diﬀusion is also expected to be signiﬁcantly weaker than
the importance of AGN feedbacks, especially in galaxy groups,
where most of the Fe drops are found.

Finally, and interestingly, some hydrodynamical simulations
(Schindler et al. 2005; Kapferer et al. 2009) predict a drop of cen-
tral abundances when assuming galactic winds as the dominant
mechanism transporting the metals from galaxies to the ICM.
However, the typical extent of such a drop is ∼400 kpc, which
is always much larger than the typical extents derived from our
observations (a few tens of kpc at most). Moreover, this suppres-
sion of metal enrichment by galactic winds should preferentially

ﬁg. 3), and by the diﬀerent groups selected in each respective
sample. In particular, Rasmussen & Ponman (2007) consider
MKW 4 part of their group sample, and using the ACIS instru-
ment, they detect an oﬀ-centre Fe peak reaching ∼5–10 times
the proto-solar value, which is more than two times the Fe abun-
dance in its centre. This extreme measured metallicity should
partly explain the high value of their second innermost average
bin (Fig. 13, right). On the other hand, mismatch is also found
beyond ∼0.2r500, where the average metallicity of Rasmussen &
Ponman (2007) in the outskirts is measured ∼2 times lower than
in this work (although still within our inferred scatter). This issue
is important to point out since Rasmussen & Ponman (2007) in-
terpret the lower enrichment in the group outskirts as a diﬀerent
groups enrichment history compared to more massive clusters.
While uncertainties in the respective background treatments of
the studies might explain the disagreement with our results, we
must point out that an updated Chandra calibration may revise
upwards the Fe abundance in the outermost bins (e.g. ∼+25% for
NGC 4325 Rasmussen & Ponman 2009). Moreover (and perhaps
more importantly), Rasmussen & Ponman (2007) measured the
Fe abundances via only the Fe-L complex, and they assumed
a single-temperature model in the spectra of each of their out-
ermost bins. This may signiﬁcantly underestimate the Fe abun-
dance in case of a multi-phase plasma in the group outskirts.

ﬁle (Fig. 1) and predictions from hydrodynamical simulations from
Planelles et al. (2014, solid red lines) and Rasia et al. (2015, solid blue
lines), both modelling AGN feedback eﬀects on the chemical enrich-
ment. The red dashed lines show the same simulation set from Planelles
et al. (2014) with a normalisation rescaled by a factor of 0.55.

7.3.2. Comparison with simulations

The average Fe radial proﬁle derived in this work (Fig. 1) can
also be compared with the average Fe proﬁle predicted by hy-
drodynamical simulations. Two of the most recent simulation
sets of the ICM including metal enrichment were performed by
Planelles et al. (2014) and Rasia et al. (2015). Both sets use
the smooth particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-3, assume a
Chabrier initial mass function (IMF; Chabrier 2003), and incor-
porate the chemical evolution model (including metal production
by SNIa, SNcc, and AGB stars) of Tornatore et al. (2007), tak-
ing SN-powered galactic winds and AGN feedback into account.
The comparison of our average Fe proﬁle with these two simu-
lation sets is shown in Fig. 14.

The mean emission-weighted Fe proﬁle from the "AGN set"
of Planelles et al. (2014, derived from a sample of 36 hot nearby

systems within 29 simulated regions), shown in solid red lines
(with its scatter in the shaded red area) in Fig. 14, does not agree
with our observations. In fact, a similar result was already dis-
cussed by the authors when comparing their predictions with the
observations of Leccardi & Molendi (2008). However, as ex-
plained by Planelles et al. (2014), this signiﬁcantly higher nor-
malisation can be easily explained by outdated assumptions on
the SN yields, the assumed IMF, the fraction of binary systems
(eventually resulting in SNIa), and/or the SN eﬃciency to re-
lease metals into the ICM. The overall shape of the AGN set
proﬁle, however, is more crucial to confront with observational
data, since AGN feedbacks presumably have a strong inﬂuence
on (i) displacing metals from star-forming regions, (ii) suppress-
ing star formation, and (iii) preventing cooling of the hot gas to
temperatures emitting outside of the X-ray energy band. Inter-

estingly, when applying a factor of ∼0.55 to the normalisation of
this predicted Fe proﬁle (dashed red lines in Fig. 14), we ﬁnd an
excellent agreement with our measurements. In other words, the
simulations of Planelles et al. (2014) are remarkably successful
at reproducing the measured chemical properties of the ICM, as
long as the overall metal content produced and released in the
gas phase is ∼1.8 times lower than originally assumed. This is
not impossible, as both SN yields and SNIa rates are still un-
certain within a factor of ∼2 (Wiersma et al. 2009). However,
a direct comparison between our results and the simulations of
Planelles et al. (2014) should be treated with caution. In fact,
the simulation sets of Planelles et al. (2014) contain both relaxed
and non-relaxed systems (and fail to recover the cool-core versus
non-cool-core dichotomy), while our observation are only based
on cool-core clusters. Moreover, the simulated proﬁles are ex-
tracted from three-dimensional spherical shells, whereas our re-
sults are projected on the plane of the sky. This latter diﬀerence,
however, is not expected to strongly aﬀect the present compari-
son (Sect. 6.1).

A signiﬁcant improvement of the simulation sets of Planelles
et al. (2014) has been achieved by Rasia et al. (2015), shown by
the solid blue lines (with its scatter in the shaded blue area) in
Fig. 14. This more recent set of simulations, also including AGN
feedback eﬀects, constitutes the ﬁrst success of disentangling
cool-core (shown in Fig. 14) and non-cool-core clusters. We ﬁnd
a reasonable agreement between the simulated proﬁle of Ra-
sia et al. (2015) and our observed proﬁle within ∼0.05–0.2r500.
Beyond ∼0.2r500, the simulated proﬁle slightly underestimates
our observations (∼20–25%), but still lies within the scatter,
which also includes possible systematic uncertainties (see Sect.
6). Here as well, care must be taken when directly comparing
observations and simulations. Similar to Planelles et al. (2014),
the simulated proﬁle of Rasia et al. (2015) is also unprojected.
Moreover, this proﬁle is also mass weighted, while our mea-
surements are directly derived from spectroscopy and are thus
emission weighted. The conversion of mass weighted to emis-
sion weighted Fe proﬁles may result in a ∼30% increase of the
normalisation within r500 (Planelles et al. 2014). Such a change
in the proﬁle normalisation would lead to an excellent agree-
ment with our results outside ∼0.2r500, but to predictions that
are slightly too high below this radius.

Furthermore, from a numerical point of view, simulations of
the chemo-dynamical state of the very core ((cid:46)0.05r500) of the
ICM are extremely challenging. Nevertheless, the good over-
all agreement between theoretical models and observations pre-
sented in this paper must emphasise the remarkable progress
achieved by simulation groups in recent years. Future and more
complete simulations will surely help to further improve the cur-
rent picture of metal distributions in the ICM (e.g. Biﬃ et al.
2017).

7.4. Radial contribution of SNIa and SNcc products

From Figs. 3 and 5 and the discussion above (e.g. Sect. 6.4),
it clearly appears that the radial abundance proﬁles of O, Mg,
Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Ni decrease with radius. Except Ar (see Sect.
7.2), all these proﬁles also scale quite remarkably with the Fe ra-
dial distribution, keeping a constant X/Fe ratio out to (and some-
times even beyond) 0.2r500. In particular, the uniform radial O/Fe
ratio is an important result. It is in contradiction with the ﬂat
O proﬁles found in, for example A 496 (Tamura et al. 2001),
M 87 (Böhringer et al. 2001; Matsushita et al. 2003; Werner
et al. 2006a), NGC 5044 (Buote et al. 2003), AWM 7 (Sato et al.
2008), and a sample of 19 clusters (Tamura et al. 2004). On the

simulation set of Planelles et al. (2014).

contrary, this trend is consistent with the peaked O proﬁles found
in, for example A S1101 (de Plaa et al. 2006), A 3526 (Sanders &

bul et al. 2012b), A 4059 (Mernier et al. 2015), and 5 cool-core

In Fig. 15, we show a comparison of our measured Si/Fe
proﬁle (from Fig. 5) with two equivalent proﬁles reported from
the literature. In their sample of 15 nearby galaxy groups, Ras-
mussen & Ponman (2007, purple triangles) measured a ﬂat Si/Fe
proﬁle up to 0.5r500, followed by a dramatic increase in the out-
skirts (although observed with rather large error bars in two ra-
dial bins only). In a companion paper (Rasmussen & Ponman
2009), the same authors interpret this increase as a dominant en-
riching fraction of SNcc products in group outskirts, in agree-
ment with the increasing O/Fe and/or Mg/Fe proﬁles observed
in other studies (see above). Taking advantage of the low instru-
mental background of Suzaku XIS, Simionescu et al. (2015, four
outermost green circles) reported a ﬂat Si/Fe radial distribution
in the outskirts of the Virgo cluster, in agreement with the Si/Fe
ratios measured at smaller radii (Simionescu et al. 2010, two in-
nermost green circles). Our ﬂat Si/Fe proﬁle is in agreement with
the results of Simionescu et al. (2010, 2015) and contradicts the
results of Rasmussen & Ponman (2007). Furthermore, our re-
sults are consistent with the Si/Fe predictions from the simula-
tion sets of Planelles et al. (2014, solid red line), but we do not
observe the slight predicted increase of Si relative to Fe towards
the core below 0.1r500, expected from the suppression of cooling
(predominantly processed by SNcc products) due to the AGN
feedback (see also Fabjan et al. 2010). This issue was already
discussed by Planelles et al. (2014), and could be due to eﬃcient
diﬀusion or transport mechanisms that were not yet implemented
in the simulations.

In order to better quantify the radial contribution of SNIa and
SNcc products, we ﬁt the X/Fe abundance ratios in each radial
bin with a combination of SNIa and SNcc yield models as de-
scribed in Mernier et al. (2016b). Based on their results, and be-
cause the large uncertainties of the measured abundances in in-
dividual bins do not allow us to favour any yield model in partic-
ular, we select the following two combinations of one SNIa and
one SNcc model that reproduce equally well the average abun-

able (at least in clusters), we cannot fully exclude a changing
SNIa/SNcc contribution to the enrichment beyond ∼0.2r500 in
clusters and/or groups. Finally, and unsurprisingly, we ﬁnd that
a diﬀerent choice of SN yield models only aﬀects the absolute
average fSNIa value and not its relative radial distribution.

Implications for the enrichment history of the ICM

As discussed throughout this paper, our results are fully con-
sistent with a uniform contribution of SNIa (SNcc) products
in the ICM from its very centre up to (at least) ∼0.5r500. Al-
though, accounting for various systematic uncertainties (includ-
ing the population scatter, which dominates over the other un-
certainties even at large radius), we cannot fully exclude an in-
crease/decrease in the SNIa contribution to the enrichment out-
side ∼0.2r500, we do not observe a clear trend supporting that
scenario. If true, the uniform radial contribution of SNIa prod-
ucts in the ICM has interesting consequences, as it provides
valuable constraints on the enrichment history of galaxy clus-
ters/groups.

One of the main pictures (Sect. 1) that had been proposed to
explain the results showing a ﬂat O proﬁle in the previous liter-
ature, is that the bulk of SNcc events would have exploded early
on, during or shortly before the formation of clusters/groups
(∼10 Gyr ago), and their products would have eﬃciently dif-
fused within the entire cluster. The Fe central excess, tracing the
SNIa products, would then mostly originate from the BCG at
later cosmic time, hence supporting the idea that SNIa explode
signiﬁcantly later than the time required for more massive stars
to release (mostly via SNcc explosions) and diﬀuse their metals
into the ICM. One issue with this scenario was that, whereas one
should expect a shallower Si proﬁle than the Fe proﬁle (since
Si is synthesised by both SNIa and SNcc), many previous stud-
ies reported a constant (e.g. Sanders & Fabian 2006a; Sato et al.
2008) or sometimes even decreasing (Million et al. 2011) Si/Fe
ratio across radius. To solve this paradox, Finoguenov et al.
(2002) propose a diversity of SNIa to contribute to the ICM en-
richment: promptly exploding SNIa (whose products are sup-
posed to be eﬃciently mixed over the whole cluster) produce
less Si than SNIa with longer delay times (mostly enriching the
cluster core). Since our results suggest a uniform contribution of
SNIa (SNcc) products in the core and in the outskirts, invoking a
diversity in SNIa (as well as in their delay times) is not required
anymore, and alternative scenarii should be considered.

In their study of the chemical enrichment in Hydra A,
Simionescu et al. (2009) found that the central O excess can be
explained either if stellar winds are 3 to 8 times more eﬃcient in
releasing metals than previously predicted, or if 3–8 × 108 SNcc
had exploded in the cluster core over the last ∼10 Gyr. Alterna-
tively, ram-pressure stripping may help to build a central peak
of SNcc (and SNIa) products from infalling cluster galaxy mem-
bers (Domainko et al. 2006); however such a process should also
occur at rather large distances (∼1 Mpc), while the O excess is
only observed in Hydra A within ∼120 kpc. Similarly, Million
et al. (2011) found centrally peaked proﬁles for eight elements
in the core of M 87. In addition to the peaked Mg proﬁle, they
measured a steeper gradient for Si and S than for Fe, and inter-
pret their ﬁndings as the result of eﬃcient enriching winds from
a central pre-enriched stellar population and/or intermittent for-
mation of massive stars in the BCG.

If the central O (and/or Mg) excess is indeed due to a sig-
niﬁcant amount of concentrated SNcc explosions in the cluster
core, one relevant question is whether this SNcc peak was pro-
duced prior to the formation of the BCG, or by the BCG itself at a

successively (see text). The corresponding shaded areas show the uncer-
tainties when accounting for the scatter of the measurements. For each

dance pattern within the ICM core (0.2r500 or 0.05r500; Mernier
et al. 2016b):

1. The one-dimensional delayed-detonation SNIa yield model
("DDTc") introduced in Badenes et al. (2005) that repro-
duces the spectral features of the Tycho supernova rem-
nant (Badenes et al. 2006), combined with the SNcc yield
model from Nomoto et al. (2013) assuming an initial metal-
licity of stellar progenitors of Zinit = 0.001, and averaged
over a Salpeter IMF (Salpeter 1955) between 10 and 40 M(cid:12)
("Z0.001");

2. The three-dimensional delayed-detonation SNIa yield model
("N100H") from Seitenzahl et al. (2013), combined with the
SNcc yield model from Nomoto et al. (2013), assuming an
initial metallicity of stellar progenitors of Zinit = 0.008 and
IMF-averaged similarly as for the Z0.001 model ("Z0.008").

We ﬁt the X/Fe abundance pattern measured in each radial bin
(Fig. 5) successively with these two combinations of models.
This allows us to estimate fSNIa, the fraction of SNIa over the
total number of SNe (i.e. SNIa+SNcc) contributing to the en-
richment, as a function of the radial distance. This is shown in
Fig. 16 (full sample) and Fig. 17 (clusters, left panel; groups,
right panel). In all the (sub)samples, fSNIa is fully consistent with
being uniform up to ∼0.5r500, and agrees very well with the av-
erage values found in the ICM core (Mernier et al. 2016b, dotted
horizontal lines in the ﬁgures). In some radial bins, we observe
slight but signiﬁcant (>1σ) deviations from these core-averaged
values. For example, we cannot exclude a slight increase of fSNIa
in groups, at least from ∼0.01r500 to ∼0.1r500. However, these
deviations completely vanish when we account for the scatters
of Fig. 5 in the estimation of fSNIa (shaded areas). Such a radi-
ally uniform fraction has also been recently measured in A 3112
(Ezer et al. 2016).

As discussed in Sect. 6, the average values may be af-
fected by systematic uncertainties and accounting for the scat-
ters is conservative enough to keep all the systematic eﬀects
under control. Consequently, and although the ﬂat radial be-
haviour of fSNIa based on the average X/Fe ratios is quite remark-

later stage of the cluster assembly. Recent simulations (Tornatore
et al. 2007; Fabjan et al. 2010) suggest that the enrichment time
of both O and Fe in the inner ∼0.4r500 is signiﬁcantly shorter
than outside this radius, which may imply that the BCG is in-
deed responsible for the central excess in the ICM observed for
both SNIa and SNcc products. Moreover, the recent analysis of
WARPJ1415.1+3612 (z (cid:39) 1) by De Grandi et al. (2014) shows
that the bulk of the central Fe excess was already present ∼8 Gyr
ago and that its slope is steeper than at present times. This sug-
gests in turn that the BCG is the dominant source responsible for
the enrichment in the ICM core, and that the metals released by
the BCG spread out of the core with time via diﬀusive/mixing
processes.

If the Fe peak indeed comes from the BCG (as the Fe mass
in the ICM could suggest; Böhringer et al. 2004; De Grandi et al.
2004) and has a similar (scaled) radial distribution as SNcc prod-
ucts, as our results suggest, this central SNcc enrichment may
also originate from the BCG. Although most BCGs appear red
and dead at present times (with typical star formation rates of
a few M(cid:12)/yr at most; e.g. McDonald et al. 2011), their star for-
mation was dramatically higher over the last ∼9 Gyr (McDon-
ald et al. 2016), and in some cases, can still reach a few tens to
hundreds M(cid:12)/yr at z (cid:39) 0 (O’Dea et al. 2008). This past (and,
sometimes, present) high star formation in BCGs could thus be
responsible for the central excess of SNcc products seen in the
ICM. In this case, and assuming that some mechanisms diﬀuse
out the metals from the cluster core (see above), the consistency
between the slopes of the radial SNIa and SNcc distributions
suggests that the bulk of SNIa exploded quite shortly after the
period of star formation in the BCG. More precisely, the typical
delay time of SNIa should not be larger than the timescale of
metal mixing/diﬀusing processes in the ICM.

More generally, and regardless of whether the central excess
of SNcc products reported in this study originates from the BCG
or not, the (lack of) radial dependence translates into a time de-
pendence of the chemical enrichment patterns that we can in-
fer. Speciﬁcally, the consistent radial proﬁles for all the mea-
sured abundances may suggest that the SNIa and SNcc com-
ponents of the enrichment originate from the same astrophysi-
cal source(s) and have been occurring at similar epochs. Such
a reasoning can be applied to the case of the intra-cluster stel-
lar population. Both observations (e.g. Krick et al. 2006; Krick
& Bernstein 2007) and simulations (Willman et al. 2004) pro-

vide increasing evidence for a signiﬁcant fraction (10–50%) of
stars that are unbound to any cluster galaxy and could poten-
tially contribute to the ICM enrichment (Domainko et al. 2004).
As it takes a substantial time for these stars to be ejected and
travel away from their galaxy hosts, the intra-cluster population
should essentially contain low-mass stars, and thus enrich the
ICM predominantly with SNIa, likely providing a diﬀerent radial
distribution of SNIa products than that of SNcc products (com-
ing from other sources). This picture disagrees with our present
results. Therefore, under these assumptions, intra-cluster stars
may not be the dominant source of the ICM enrichment. A sim-
ilar conclusion is reached by Kapferer et al. (2010) on the basis
of hydrodynamical simulations and SNIa expected rates.

In summary, while it was commonly thought from previous
studies that the bulk of the SNcc (SNIa) enrichment would con-
tribute only at early (late) times, recent works — including our
present study — have provided increasing evidence that the SNIa
versus SNcc dichotomy is not pronounced since the chemical
composition does not evolve dramatically with radius.

The astrophysical implications discussed here hold only if
further and deﬁnitive conﬁrmation of the uniform distribution of
fSNIa is achieved with more accurate instruments on board fu-
ture missions. In particular, the high spectral resolution and ef-
fective area of Athena will be required to investigate the distribu-
tion of key elements, like O or Mg, with unprecedented accuracy
from the core to the outskirts. Moreover, a complete discussion
would be required to fully quantify the speculative arguments
used here, and therefore, to pursue the extensive use of realistic
hydrodynamical simulations, preferably including all the poten-
tial sources of (SNIa and SNcc) enrichment and all the mixing
and diﬀusion mechanisms known so far.

8. Conclusions
In this work, we used deep XMM-Newton/EPIC observations of
44 nearby cool-core galaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals (all
taken from the CHEERS catalogue, i.e. ∼4.5 Ms of total net ex-
posure) to derive the average projected radial abundance pro-
ﬁles of eight elements in the ICM. Whereas average Fe and Si
abundance proﬁles had been previously reported in the literature
(though over limited samples only), the O, Mg, S, Ar, Ca, and Ni
proﬁles are measured and averaged over a large sample for the
ﬁrst time. This allows an unprecedented estimation of the aver-

age radial contribution of SNIa and SNcc products in the ICM.
Our results can be summarised as follows.

– The Fe abundance can be robustly constrained out to ∼
0.9r500 and ∼ 0.6r500 in clusters and groups, respectively,
while most of the other abundances are uncertain beyond
∼0.5r500. Owing to a robust and conservative modelling of
the EPIC background, the systematic background uncertain-
ties are limited typically to a few per cent, which are usually
smaller than (or comparable to) the statistical uncertainties
for each object. The other systematic uncertainties (related to
MOS-pn discrepancies, projection eﬀects, an uncertain tem-
perature distribution, or selection eﬀects) are always smaller
than the population scatter derived in each average proﬁle.
Therefore, the latter can be considered as a conservative limit
for our measurements.

– The average radial proﬁles of all the considered elements ex-
hibit a centrally peaked distribution, and seem to converge at
large radii consistently towards the limits (0.09–0.37 times
proto-solar) assessed at r180 by Molendi et al. (2016). When
rescaled by the X/Fe ratios measured previously in the ICM
core (Mernier et al. 2016a), the average proﬁles of all the
elements (except perhaps Ar) follow the average Fe proﬁle
very well out to at least ∼0.5r500. Similarly, the average ra-
dial X/Fe proﬁles (again, with the possible exception of Ar)
are remarkably uniform out to this radius.

– Subdividing our sample into clusters (>1.7 keV) and groups
(<1.7 keV) subsamples, we ﬁnd that groups are on aver-
age ∼21% less enriched in Fe than clusters. From 0.01r500
to 0.5r500, this fraction is rather constant and no signiﬁcant
change is observed in the slopes of the two subsamples. Be-
low and beyond this radial range, the similar enrichment
level found in clusters and groups can be explained by se-
lection and binning eﬀects. Interestingly, no sign of metal
enhancement towards more massive objects could be signiﬁ-
cantly detected in the other proﬁles (with the possible excep-
tion of the O proﬁle).

– The average Fe proﬁle for clusters reported here agrees
remarkably well with previous observations (Leccardi &
Molendi 2008; Sanderson et al. 2009; Matsushita 2011). The
agreement of our average Fe proﬁle for groups with the pre-
vious observations of Rasmussen & Ponman (2007) is less
good, but still comparable within uncertainties. Although it
should be treated with caution, the comparison of our mea-
sured Fe proﬁle with predictions from recent hydrodynam-
ical simulations, taking AGN feedback and galactic winds
eﬀects into account (Planelles et al. 2014; Rasia et al. 2015),
is also very encouraging. Future cluster simulations will be
interesting to compare with our measurements.

– In 14 systems (∼32% of our sample), we detect a signiﬁcant
central drop of the Fe abundance. This can also be observed
in the average abundance proﬁles (both for Fe and the other
elements) by an apparent ﬂattening below ∼0.01r500. We do
not see a clear correlation between the depth of such metal
drops and their radial extent. These drops are probably real
and could be related to dust depletion of metals in the very
core of the ICM, before they are dragged out by AGN feed-
back and released back in the hot gas phase. The slightly
steeper proﬁle of Ar (expected not to be incorporated in dust
grains), compared to that of Fe, could (at least partly) witness
dust depletion of the other elements within ∼0.1 r500. How-
ever, the (statistical and systematic) uncertainties prevent us
from ﬁrmly conﬁrming or ruling out the presence of a central
Ar drop.

– Using the approach described in Mernier et al. (2016b), we
estimate the radial contribution of SNIa products to the ICM
enrichment ( fSNIa). Although the scatter (and, by extension,
the other systematic uncertainties) prevents us from exclud-
ing sudden changes in the outskirts, our observations sug-
gest, on average, a remarkably uniform fSNIa distribution out
to, at least, 0.5r500. This result contrasts with the dramatic in-
crease of SNcc contribution in the outskirts inferred by Ras-
mussen & Ponman (2009), but is consistent with more recent
measurements (Simionescu et al. 2015; Ezer et al. 2016) and
simulations (Fabjan et al. 2010; Planelles et al. 2014; Biﬃ
et al. 2017). This suggests that the major fraction of the SNIa
and SNcc enriching the ICM may share the same origins and
may have both exploded before mixing and diﬀusion pro-
cesses played a signiﬁcant role in spreading out the metals. In
particular, since there is increasing evidence that the central
Fe excess originates from the BCG, it is likely that a past in-
tense period of star formation in the BCG had released SNcc
products in the ICM core in a similar way.

– Finally, we emphasise that, although the systematic uncer-
tainties considered here are under control, the Ni abundance
may be systematically overestimated when using SPEXACT
v2. Whereas it should not have a signiﬁcant impact on the
shape of the Ni proﬁle presented here, such a bias might af-
fect the average Ni/Fe ratio (e.g. Mernier et al. 2016a) and
the subsequent constraints inferred on the SNIa yield mod-
els (e.g. Mernier et al. 2016b). We will devote a forthcoming
paper to that speciﬁc issue.

While the abundance proﬁles of some elements (such as Fe
or Si) could be remarkably constrained thanks to the large statis-
tics of our sample, this paper clearly shows that, apart from the
apparent scatter of the measurements, the most important limita-
tions encountered so far are the systematic uncertainties, in par-
ticular related to MOS-pn cross-calibration imperfections (see
also Schellenberger et al. 2015; Mernier et al. 2016a). Using the
current X-ray facilities, a signiﬁcant improvement of the accu-
racy of our results may only be achieved by improving the EPIC
cross-calibration and better understanding all the systematic bi-
ases that could aﬀect the EPIC instruments. Nevertheless, further
improvement in interpreting these results could also come from
studying a more representative sample, for example including
non-cool-core systems as well.

Despite our current eﬀorts and achievements, we must stress
the considerable breakthrough that the next X-ray missions (e.g.
Athena; Barret et al. 2013) will be able to achieve. On the one
hand, the very large eﬀective area of future instruments will al-
low us to probe a detailed view of the chemical state of cluster
outskirts, which is still challenging for XMM-Newton, as demon-
strated in this paper. On the other hand, the remarkable spectral
resolution of micro-calorimeters on board these future missions
will considerably reduce the uncertainties on both the thermal
structure and the distribution of various metals within and out-
side cluster cores. Therefore, there is no doubt that the next gen-
eration of X-ray observatories will bring further light on this
study and provide a valuable understanding of the full history
of the ICM enrichment.

proﬁles

This section enumerates the objects of our sample (CHEERS)
and provides supplementary information on their individual Fe
proﬁles and radial extents. Table A.1 lists all the sources con-
sidered in this paper and their r500 values (adapted from Pinto
et al. 2015, and references therein). For each element X, we also
provide rout,X, the maximum radius at which we evaluate the cor-
responding abundance (see Sect. 4.1 for further details). The Fe
radial proﬁles of each source of our sample are shown in Figs.
A.1 (clusters) and A.2 (groups).

Appendix B: Average abundance proﬁles of O, Mg,

Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Ni

In Sect. 5.1 we provided numerical values of the radial Fe proﬁle
in the full sample (Table 2) and after subdividing it into clusters
and groups (Table 3). In this Appendix we extend these numbers
to the average O, Mg, Si, Ar, Ca, and Ni proﬁles that are shown
in Figs 3 and 4 (see Sect. 5.2 for further details). These values
are listed in Table B.1 (full sample) and Table B.2 (comparison
between clusters and groups).
