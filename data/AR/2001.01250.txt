ABSTRACT

Context. Large-amplitude, longitudinal ﬁlament oscillations triggered by solar ﬂares have been well established. However, ﬁlament
oscillations enhanced by ﬂares have never been reported.
Aims. In this paper, we report the multiwavelength observations of a very long ﬁlament in active region (AR) 11112 on 2010 October
18. The ﬁlament was composed of two parts, the eastern part (EP) and western part (WP). We focus on longitudinal oscillations of
the EP, which were enhanced by two homologous C-class ﬂares in the same AR.
Methods. The ﬁlament was observed in Hα wavelength by the GONG and in extreme ultra-violet (EUV) wavelengths by the Atmo-
spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Line-of-sight magnetograms were provided by
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board SDO. The global three-dimensional (3D) magnetic ﬁelds were obtained using
the potential ﬁeld source surface modeling. Soft X-ray light curves of the two ﬂares were recorded by the GOES spacecraft. White-
light images of the corona were observed by the LASCO/C2 coronagraph on board SOHO. To reproduce part of the observations, we
perform one-dimensional, hydrodynamic numerical simulations using the MPI-AMRVAC code.
Results. The C1.3 ﬂare was conﬁned without a CME. Both EP and WP of the ﬁlament were slightly disturbed and survived the ﬂare.
After 5 hrs, eruption of the WP generated a C2.6 ﬂare and a narrow, jet-like CME. Three oscillating threads (thda, thdb, thdc) are
obviously identiﬁed in the EP and their oscillations are naturally divided into three phases by the two ﬂares. The initial amplitude
ranges from 1.6 to 30 Mm with a mean value of ∼14 Mm. The period ranges from 34 to 73 minutes with a mean value of ∼53
minutes. The curvature radii of the magnetic dips are estimated to be 29 to 133 Mm with a mean value of ∼74 Mm. The damping
times ranges from ∼62 to ∼96 minutes with a mean value of ∼82 minutes. The value of τ/P is between 1.2 and 1.8. For thda in the
EP, the amplitudes were enhanced by the two ﬂares from 6.1 Mm to 6.8 Mm after the C1.3 ﬂare and further to 21.4 Mm after the C2.6
ﬂare. The period variation as a result of perturbation from the ﬂares was within 20%. The attenuation became faster after the C2.6
ﬂare.
Conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of large-amplitude, longitudinal ﬁlament oscillations enhanced
by ﬂares. Numerical simulations reproduce the oscillations of thda very well. The simulated amplitudes and periods are close to the
observed values, while the damping time in the last phase is longer, implying additional mechanisms should be taken into account
apart from radiative loss.

1. Introduction

Solar prominences are dense and cool plasma structures sus-
pending in the corona (Labrosse et al. 2010; Mackay et al. 2010;
Parenti 2014; Vial & Engvold 2015; Gibson 2018, and refer-
ences therein). The density of prominences is two orders of mag-
nitude larger than the corona, while the temperature is two orders
of magnitude lower than the corona. Prominences are also called
ﬁlaments that appear darker than the surroundings on the solar
disk (Engvold 1976; Martin 1998). Prominences (or ﬁlaments)
can be observed in Hα, Ca ii H, He i 10830 Å, extreme-ultraviolet
(EUV), and radio wavelengths (e.g., van Ballegooijen 2004;
Berger et al. 2010; Schmieder et al. 2010, 2014; Shen et al.
2015; Yan et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017). It is generally accepted
that the gravity of prominences is balanced by the upward
tension force of magnetic dips in sheared arcades (Xia et al.

2012; Keppens & Xia 2014; Gunár & Mackay 2015), mag-
netic ﬂux ropes (DeVore & Antiochos 2000; Martens & Zwaan
2001; Su & van Ballegooijen 2012), or both (Liu et al. 2012).
Filaments are located in ﬁlament channels in active regions
(ARs), quiet region, and polar regions. The origins of mate-
rial in ﬁlaments include direct injection from the chromosphere
(Li & Zhang 2013), upward elevation from below (Lites 2005),
evaporation-condensation (Xia et al. 2011), and reconnection-
condensation (Li et al. 2018b). The lifetimes of ﬁlaments range
from a few hours to several days. After destabilization, they are
likely to erupt and generate ﬂares and/or coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) (Shibata et al. 1995). When the compression from the
large-scale, overlaying magnetic ﬁeld lines is strong enough,
the ﬁlament fails to erupt successfully and evolves into a CME
(Ji et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2015).

After being disturbed, ﬁlaments are prone to oscillate pe-
riodically (Oliver & Ballester 2002; Arregui & Ballester 2011;
Arregui et al. 2012). The period of oscillations ranges from a
few minutes to tens of minutes or even hours (Jing et al. 2006;
Lin et al. 2007). In most cases, they oscillate with small am-
plitudes and short periods of 3−5 minutes (Ning et al. 2009;
Li et al. 2018a). Large-amplitude oscillations are often observed
as a result of sudden attacks, such as ﬂares (Ramsey & Smith
1966), microﬂares (Jing et al. 2003; Vršnak et al. 2007), coronal
jets (Luna et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2017b), surges (Chen et al.
2008), shock waves (Shen et al. 2014b; Pant et al. 2016), and
global EUV waves associated with CMEs (Eto et al. 2002;
Shen et al. 2014a).

Due to various kinds of disturbances, the direction of ﬁl-
ament oscillations may change from case to case (Luna et al.
2018). For longitudinal oscillations, the ﬁlament material os-
cillates along the threads with small angles of 10◦-20◦ be-
tween the threads and spine (Jing et al. 2003; Vršnak et al. 2007;
Zhang et al. 2012; Li & Zhang 2012; Bi et al. 2014; Chen et al.
2014; Luna et al. 2014, 2017; Zhou et al. 2018; Awasthi et al.
2019; Zapiór et al. 2019). The polarization of transverse os-
cillations could be horizontal (vertical) if the whole body os-
cillates parallel (vertical) to the solar surface (Hyder 1966;
Kleczek & Kuperus 1969; Zhang & Ji 2018). Sometimes, two
ﬁlaments experience diﬀerent
types of oscillations due to
diﬀerent angles between the incoming waves and ﬁlaments
(Shen et al. 2014b). Occasionally, diﬀerent parts of a whole ﬁla-
ment experience diﬀerent types of oscillations (Pant et al. 2016;
Zhang et al. 2017b; Mazumder et al. 2020). Interestingly, the pa-
rameters of oscillations, including amplitude, period, and damp-
ing time vary with time, possibly due to the thread-thread in-
teraction (Zhang et al. 2017a; Zhou et al. 2017). Hence, ﬁlament
oscillations show complex and complicated behaviors.

The primary restoring force of large-amplitude longitudi-
nal ﬁlament oscillations is believed to be the gravity of ﬁl-
ament (Luna & Karpen 2012; Luna et al. 2012; Zhang et al.
2012, 2013; Luna et al. 2016). Therefore, longitudinal oscilla-
tions can well be described with a pendulum model. Curva-
ture radii of magnetic dips can be exactly diagnosed, and the
lower limits of transverse magnetic ﬁeld strength of the dips
can be roughly estimated (Luna et al. 2014, 2017; Zhang et al.
2017a,b; Mazumder et al. 2020). The damping mechanisms,
however, are still controversial. Hydrodynamic (HD) and mag-
netohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations have greatly
shed light on the damping mechanisms, such as mass accre-
tion (Luna & Karpen 2012; Ruderman & Luna 2016), radiative
loss (Zhang et al. 2013), and wave leakage (Zhang et al. 2019).
When mass drainage takes place at the footpoints of coronal
loops as a result of large initial amplitudes, the damping times
are signiﬁcantly reduced (Zhang et al. 2013).

So far, longitudinal ﬁlament oscillations triggered by ﬂares
have been substantially investigated. However, ﬁlament oscilla-
tions enhanced by ﬂares have never been reported. In this article,
we report the multiwavelength observations of longitudinal os-
cillations of a ﬁlament in AR 11112 on 2010 October 18. The
evolution of ﬁlament oscillations was divided into three phases,
during which a conﬁned C1.3 ﬂare and an eruptive C2.6 ﬂare
associated with a jet-like CME occurred in the AR. Data anal-
yses are described in Sect. 2. Observational results are shown
in Sect. 3. To reproduce part of the observations, we perform
one-dimensional (1D) HD numerical simulations in Sect. 4. Dis-
cussions and a brief summary are arranged in Sect. 5 and Sect. 6.

2. Observations and data analysis

The ﬁlament with sinistral chirality was observed in Hα line
center by the ground-based telescope of Global Oscillation Net-
work Group (GONG). It was also observed in EUV wave-
lengths (171 and 304 Å) by the Atmospheric Imaging Assem-
bly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamics Ob-
servatory (SDO). The photospheric line-of-sight (LOS) magne-
tograms were provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Im-
ager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) on board SDO. The AIA and
HMI data were calibrated using the standard Solar Software
(SSW) programs aia_prep.pro and hmi_prep.pro. The full-disk
Hα and AIA 304 Å images were coaligned with a precision
of ∼1′′. 2 using the cross correlation method. Three-dimensional
(3D) global magnetic ﬁelds at 12:04 UT were obtained by the
potential ﬁeld source surface (PFSS; Schrijver & De Rosa 2003)
modeling. The 1−70 Å ﬂux of the ﬂares was recorded by the
Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE; Woods et al.
2012) on board SDO. Soft X-ray (SXR) ﬂuxes of the ﬂares in
0.5−4 Å and 1−8 Å were recorded by the GOES spacecraft.
The CME associated with the C2.6 ﬂare was observed by the
C2 white light (WL) coronagraph of the Large Angle Spectro-
scopic Coronagraph (LASCO; Brueckner et al. 1995) on board
SOHO1. The LASCO/C2 data were calibrated using the SSW
program c2_calibrate.pro. The observational parameters from
multiple instruments are listed in Table 1.

3. Observational results

3.1. Conﬁned ﬂare

In Fig. 1, the top panels show 171 and 304 Å images observed by
AIA at 07:00 UT. The white arrows point to the long, dark ﬁla-
ment residing in AR 11112. Panel (c) shows the photospheric
LOS magnetogram observed by HMI at 06:59 UT. Panel (d)
shows the Hα image observed by GONG at 10:55:34 UT. It is
clear that the ﬁlament is located along the polarity inversion line
of the AR and is divided into two parts. The eastern part (EP) has
an apparent length of ∼650′′ and an angle of ∼26◦ relative to the
EW direction. The western part (WP) has an apparent length of
∼250′′ and an angle of ∼47◦ relative to the EW direction. Hence,
the total length of ﬁlament reaches ∼900′′. After correcting the
projection eﬀect, the true length of ﬁlament is close to the solar
radius (∼960′′).

During the whole evolution of ﬁlament, two homologous
ﬂares occurred in the AR. The ﬁrst was a conﬁned C1.3 ﬂare. In
Fig. 2, SXR light curves in 0.5−4 and 1−8 Å during 07:00−22:00
UT are plotted in panel (a). SXR intensities of the ﬂare started
to increase at ∼11:11 UT and reached the peak values at ∼11:39
UT before decreasing gradually until ∼12:24 UT. Time deriva-
tive of the 1−8 Å ﬂux as a rough proxy of hard X-ray (HXR) ﬂux
is plotted in panel (b), where the ﬁrst black dashed line denotes
the peak time at ∼11:33:20 UT. Panel (c) shows the EVE 1−70 Å
light curve with similar evolution to the 1−8 Å light curve except
delayed peaks.

Figure 3 shows the AIA 171, 304, 1600 Å, and GONG Hα
images around 11:34 UT. Bright ﬂare ribbons close to the ﬁla-
ment are evident in all wavelengths. Since the ﬂare was conﬁned,
both EP and WP of the ﬁlament were slightly disturbed without
erupting into a CME.

is shown in a movie (anim1.avi) available in the online edition.

3.2. Eruptive ﬂare and jet-like CME

About 5 hrs later, the C2.6 ﬂare took place in the same AR.
In Fig. 2(a), SXR intensities of the ﬂare started to increase at
∼16:15 UT and reached the peak values at ∼16:42 UT before
decreasing slowly until ∼18:25 UT. In Fig. 2(b), two HXR peaks
at 16:31:30 UT and 16:37:30 UT were associated with the ﬂare.
Figure 4 shows the AIA 171, 304, 1600 Å, and GONG Hα im-
ages around 16:33 UT. The ﬂare ribbon was cospatial with the
main ribbon of C1.3 ﬂare. It is found that the ribbons of both
ﬂares were located near the two endpoints of the EP.

Interestingly, the EP remained there and did not erupt during
this ﬂare, while the WP disappeared (see Fig. 4(d)). In Fig. 1(d),
an artiﬁcial slice (S2) along the WP with a length of 265′′ is
selected to investigate its evolution. Time-slice diagram of S2 in
Hα is displayed in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the WP was slightly
disturbed during the C1.3 ﬂare, while it was strongly disturbed
during the C2.6 ﬂare and ﬁnally erupted. Intermittent mass ﬂow
towards the AR at speeds of 10−20 km s−1 before eruption is
clearly manifested in the diagram.

Eruption of the WP in 304 Å was indicated as jet-like out-
ﬂow. In Fig. 6, the left panel shows a snapshot of 304 Å image
at 16:34:56 UT. An artiﬁcial slice (S3) with a length of 363′′
is selected to investigate the outﬂow. Time-slice diagram of S3
in 304 Å is displayed in the right panel. It is seen that the out-
ﬂow spurted out from ∼16:15 UT and lasted for about 30 min-
utes. The occurrence time of outﬂow was coincident with the
SXR peak time of C2.6 ﬂare. The estimated apparent velocities

(310−410 km s−1) are comparable to those of typical coronal jets
(Zhang & Ji 2014).

The 3D magnetic ﬁeld lines around AR 11112 at 12:04 UT
are drawn in Fig. 7, with open and closed ﬁeld lines being coded
with green/magenta and white lines, respectively. The direction
of open ﬁeld (green lines) is consistent with the propagation

direction of jet-like outﬂow, suggesting that the outﬂow prop-
agated along open ﬁeld lines.

WL observations of the corona from LASCO/C2 indicate
that the jet-like outﬂow propagated even further and evolved
into a narrow CME. Figure 8 shows 5 snapshots of running-
diﬀerence images observed by LASCO/C2. The CME appeared
at ∼16:59 UT and propagated until 17:48 UT in the southwest di-
rection, which is also consistent with the direction of open ﬁeld
in Fig. 7. The central position angle (CPA) and angular width
are 216◦ and 10◦, respectively. Height-time plot of the CME is
displayed in Fig. 9. A linear ﬁtting of the plot results in an ap-
parent velocity of ∼750 km s−1 in the plane of sky. It should be
emphasized that the measurements of CME heights have signiﬁ-
cant uncertainties since it is not easy to identify the leading edge.
Therefore, the derived velocity of CME is nearly twice higher
than that of outﬂow observed in EUV wavelengths.

3.3. Filamentoscillations

During 07:00−22:00 UT, the EP oscillated longitudinally along
the ﬁlament channel. In Fig. 1(a), at least three oscillating
threads (thda, thdb, and thdc) could be identiﬁed and marked by
red, cyan, and orange circles, respectively. An artiﬁcial slice (S1)
with a length of 669′′ is selected to investigate the evolution of
EP. Time-slice diagram of S1 in 171 Å is plotted in Fig. 10. It is
found that diﬀerent threads oscillated in a diﬀerent way, show-
ing a very complex behavior. Six subregions (sub1-sub6) within
the cyan boxes are extracted. Sub1 and sub2 represent oscilla-
tions before the C1.3 ﬂare. Sub3 and sub4 represent oscillations
between the two ﬂares. Sub5 and sub6 represent oscillations af-
ter the C2.6 ﬂare. For thda, the oscillation was divided into three
phases. Before the C1.3 ﬂare, it oscillated with a relatively small
amplitude and insigniﬁcant damping (see sub1). After the C1.3
ﬂare, the amplitude increased slightly (see sub3). After the C2.6
ﬂare, the amplitude became even larger with faster damping (see
sub5). For thdb, the oscillation between the two ﬂares was obvi-
ously demonstrated, suggesting that the oscillation was triggered

August 20 (Luna et al. 2014). The curvature radius ranges from
∼29 to ∼133 Mm with a mean value of 73.5 Mm, implying that
the magnetic conﬁgurations of oscillating threads diﬀer remark-
ably (Luna et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2017a). The oscillations with
smaller amplitudes (sub1-sub3) hardly damp with time, while
oscillations with larger amplitudes (sub4-sub6) damp quickly.
The damping time ranges from ∼62 to ∼96 minutes, with a mean
value of 82.4 minutes. τ/P has a range of 1.2−1.8 and a mean
value of 1.6, which is comparable to those of longitudinal oscil-
lations on 2015 June 29 (Zhang et al. 2017b), but smaller than
most of the values (2−4) in literatures (e.g., Jing et al. 2003;
Vršnak et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2012, 2017a; Luna et al. 2017).
Observations in this study conﬁrm our previous ﬁnding that os-
cillations with larger initial amplitudes tend to attenuate faster
(τ ∼ v−0.3

) (Zhang et al. 2013).

4. Numerical simulations

It is revealed from Fig. 10 that solar ﬂares can not only trig-
ger, but also facilitate longitudinal ﬁlament oscillations. In other
words, ﬂares can supply both energy and momentum to the ﬁla-
ments. To reproduce this interesting phenomenon, especially for
thda, we perform 1D HD numerical simulations following the
previous works (Zhang et al. 2012, 2013). The whole evolution
of a ﬁlament in a ﬂux tube is divided into 6 steps: formation
(or condensation) of cool material after chromospheric evapo-
ration as a result of thermal instability, steady growth due to
continuous heating and evaporation at the footpoints, relaxation
into a thermal and dynamic equilibrium state after evaporation
is halted, oscillation with a smaller amplitude after an unknown
small ﬂare, large-amplitude oscillation after ﬂare_1, and oscil-
lation with a larger amplitude after ﬂare_2. First of all, we will
brieﬂy introduce the method.

by the C1.3 ﬂare. After the C2.6 ﬂare, it became chaotic and no
distinct oscillation could be recognized. For thdc, the oscillations
were present before the C1.3 ﬂare and after the C2.6 ﬂare. Be-
tween the two ﬂares, the oscillation was not so obvious.

In Fig. 11, close-ups of the 6 subregions are shown with a
better contrast. To investigate the oscillations, we track the os-
cillating threads and mark their positions manually with white
diamonds. The marked positions are independently plotted in
Fig. 12. To derive the physical parameters of oscillations, we
carry out curve ﬁttings by utilizing a sine function multiplied by
an exponential term plus a linear term:

y = y0 + bt + A0 sin(

2π
P

t + φ0)e−t/τ,

(1)

where y0, A0, and φ0 represent the initial position, amplitude,
and phase. b, P, and τ stand for the linear velocity, period,
and damping time. The parameters are listed in Table 2. Ac-
cording to the pendulum model of longitudinal ﬁlament oscil-
lations (Luna & Karpen 2012; Zhang et al. 2012), the period (P)
depends mainly on the curvature radius (R) of a magnetic dip,
P = 2π pR/g⊙, where g⊙ = 2.7 × 102 m s−2 is the gravity accel-
eration of the Sun. In this way, the curvature radius of an oscillat-
ing thread can be estimated, RMm = 0.025P2
min, where the units
of R and P are in Mm and minute, respectively. The estimated
values of R are listed in the last row of Table 2.

From Table 2, it is found that the initial amplitude ranges
from 1.6 to 30 Mm with a mean value of 13.8 Mm. The am-
plitudes after ﬂares are considerably larger than those before
ﬂares, indicating that the oscillations are greatly enhanced by

a mean value of ∼28 km s−1. The period ranges from 34 to
73 minutes with a mean value of ∼53 minutes, which is close
to the period of prominence oscillation on 2007 February 8
(Zhang et al. 2012) and periods of ﬁlament oscillations on 2010

tion (Rosner et al. 1978; Colgan et al. 2008), and κ = 10−6T 5/2
ergs cm−1 s−1 K−1 is the Spitzer heat conductivity. The above
conservative equations are numerically solved using the MPI-
AMRVAC2 code (Keppens et al. 2012; Porth et al. 2014). The
TVDLF scheme is adopted and a 5-level AMR is used to pro-
duce a highest resolution of 7.7 km.

Figure 13 shows the geometry of symmetric ﬂux tube, con-
sisting of two vertical legs with a length of h, two quarter-circular
shoulders with a radius of r, and a quasi-sinusoidal-shaped dip
with a length of 2w and a depth of D (Zhang et al. 2012, 2013).
Hence, the total length of the ﬂux tube L = 2h + πr + 2w. The
distribution of gk(s) along the tube is determined by the geome-
try. In this study, we take h = 10 Mm, r = 10 Mm, and D = 10
Mm, so that the magnetic dip has a height of 10 Mm above the
photosphere. The total length of dip is 184.68 Mm, which corre-
sponds to a curvature radius of 90.1 Mm and an eigen period of
60.03 minutes. This is equal to the period of thda in sub1.

The ﬁrst 3 steps (formation, growth, and relaxation of ﬁla-
ment material) are the same as previous works (Xia et al. 2011;
Zhang et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2014). Figure 14 shows the den-
sity distribution of the ﬂux tube after reaching an equilibrium
state. The ﬁlament is located at the bottom of the dip. The initial
length, temperature, and density of thread are 12.9 Mm, 1.6×104
K, and ∼1010 cm−3, respectively. Oscillations of the thread are
divided into three phases according to diﬀerent impulsive heat-
ing rate H f (s):

where the heating spatial scale sscale = 2.5 Mm, peak location
speak = 15 Mm (near the left footpoint), and heating timescale
tscale = 5 minutes. Our simulations are consistent with the ob-
servations that the energy deposition (ﬂare ribbons) are near the
footpoints of oscillating ﬁlament (see Figs. 3 and 4). Impulsive
heating, with maximal heating rate (E2) of 0.015, 0.010, and
0.056 erg cm−3 s−1, is deposited 0.42, 3.52, and 8.52 hrs after the
equilibrium state (t = 0 hr) to mimic a ﬂare (unknown), a C-class
ﬂare (ﬂare_1), and another C-class ﬂare (ﬂare_2), respectively.

4.2. Simulationresults

In Fig. 15, time evolutions of density and temperature distribu-
tions along the ﬂux tube are plotted in the top and bottom panels.
In Fig. 16, time evolution of ﬁlament mass center is plotted with
black lines and the results of ﬁtting are plotted with colored lines.
The evolution of ﬁlament oscillation is divided into three phases.
In phase I, the ﬁlament oscillation is triggered by the ﬁrst impul-
sive heating resembling an unknown ﬂare and lasts for ∼3.1 hrs.
The initial amplitude, period, and damping time are 5.3 Mm, 59
minutes, and 264 minutes, respectively (see also Table 3). τ/P
is close to 4.5, indicating slow attenuation. The period is in ac-
cordance with the period of thda in sub1, while the amplitude is
slightly lower. In phase II, the oscillation is enhanced by ﬂare_1
and lasts for ∼5 hrs. The period remains ∼60 minutes because
the geometry of dip does not change. The initial amplitude in-
creases to 7.7 Mm, which is larger than that of thda after the C1.3
ﬂare in sub3. The damping time decreases, indicating faster at-
tenuation (τ/P ≈ 3.4). In phase III, the oscillation is enhanced
by ﬂare_2 and lasts for 3.6 hrs. The amplitude increases signiﬁ-
cantly to 24.7 Mm, which is comparable to that of thda after the
C2.6 ﬂare in sub5. The period increases slightly to 64 minutes,
which is predicted by the previous simulations that the period
increases marginally with the initial amplitude (P ∼ v0.05
) when
the geometry is ﬁxed (Zhang et al. 2013). The damping time de-
creases to 168 minutes and τ/P decreases to 2.6. It is obvious
that our simulations can satisfactorily reproduce the longitudinal
oscillations triggered and enhanced by solar ﬂares. Both the am-
plitudes and periods are roughly in agreement with the results of
thda. It should be noted that the slow attenuation in phases I and
II agrees with the situation of thda before the C2.6 ﬂare, while
the damping time in phase III is still insuﬃcient to explain the
quick damping of thda after the C2.6 ﬂare. Since the dominant
damping mechanism of longitudinal ﬁlament oscillations in our
model is radiative loss (Zhang et al. 2013), a combination of ra-
diative loss and wave leakage may be helpful in interpreting the
observed quick attenuation (Zhang et al. 2019).

with ﬂares can trigger ﬁlament oscillations (e.g., Eto et al. 2002;
Dai et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013). On the other hand, after study-
ing the transverse oscillation of a prominence using the spec-
troscopic observation from SOHO/SUMER, Chen et al. (2008)
proposed that transverse ﬁlament oscillation can serve as an-
other precursor of CMEs, which is supported by state-of-the-art
observations from IRIS (Zhou et al. 2016). After studying the
longitudinal oscillation of a prominence on 2007 February 8,
Zhang et al. (2012) proposed that longitudinal ﬁlament oscilla-
tion can serve as a new precursor of ﬂares and CMEs, which is
supported by the imaging observations from SDO/AIA (Bi et al.
2014).

In this study, the ﬁlament was divided into two parts, the
EP and WP. Only the EP oscillated, lasting for about 14 hrs.
Both parts survived the C1.3 ﬂare, while the WP erupted and
produced a C2.6 ﬂare and a jet-like CME. Since the two parts are
close to each other, it is likely that they have interplay during the
evolution. Longitudinal oscillations of the EP may stimulate the
destabilization and ﬁnal eruption of the WP. Compression from
the overlying magnetic ﬁeld above the EP was strong enough to
prevent it from eruption after the C2.6 ﬂare. It should be noted
that we did not perform a nonlinear force free ﬁeld extrapolation,
since the AR was very close to the limb.

6. Summary

In this paper, we investigate large-amplitude, longitudinal oscil-
lations of the EP of a very long ﬁlament in AR 11112 observed
by SDO/AIA and GONG on 2010 October 18. HD numerical
simulations using the MPI-AMRVAC code are conducted to re-
produce part of the observations. The main results are summa-
rized as follows:

1. During the evolution of ﬁlament, two homologous ﬂares oc-
curred in the same AR. The C1.3 ﬂare was conﬁned without
a CME. Both EP and WP of the ﬁlament were slightly dis-
turbed and survived the ﬂare. After 5 hrs, eruption of the WP
generated a C2.6 ﬂare and a narrow, jet-like CME observed
by LASCO/C2.

2. Three oscillating threads (thda, thdb, and thdc) are clearly
identiﬁed in the EP and their oscillations are naturally di-
vided into three phases by the two ﬂares. The initial ampli-
tude ranges from 1.6 to 30 Mm with a mean value of ∼14
Mm. The period ranges from 34 to 73 minutes with a mean
value of ∼53 minutes. The curvature radii of the magnetic
dips are estimated to be 29 to 133 Mm with a mean value of
∼74 Mm. The damping time ranges from ∼62 to ∼96 min-
utes with a mean value of ∼82 minutes. τ/P is between 1.2
and 1.8.

3. For thda in the EP, the amplitudes were enhanced by the two
ﬂares from 6.1 Mm to 6.8 Mm after the C1.3 ﬂare and fur-
ther to 21.4 Mm after the C2.6 ﬂare. The period variation as
a result of perturbation from the ﬂares was ≤20%. The atten-
uation became faster after the C2.6 ﬂare. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report of large-amplitude, longi-
tudinal ﬁlament oscillations enhanced by ﬂares.

4. Numerical simulations reproduce the oscillations of thda
very well. The simulated amplitudes and periods are close
to the observed values, while the damping time in the last
phase is longer, implying additional mechanisms should be
taken into account apart from radiative loss.

5.1. Relationshipbetween ﬂares and ﬁlament oscillations

Since the ﬁrst discovery of longitudinal ﬁlament oscillations
(Jing et al. 2003), the triggering mechanisms have been ex-
tensively investigated, such as microﬂares (Jing et al. 2006;
Vršnak et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2012, 2017a), coronal
jets
(Luna et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2017b), shock waves (Shen et al.
two solar ﬁlaments
2014b; Pant et al. 2016), merging of
(Luna et al. 2017), and failed ﬁlament eruption (Mazumder et al.
2020). Longitudinal ﬁlament oscillations triggered by ﬂares have
been well established (Luna & Karpen 2012; Zhang et al. 2013;
Zhou et al. 2017). However, ﬁlament oscillations enhanced by
ﬂares have never been reported. In this paper, for the ﬁrst time,
we report longitudinal ﬁlament oscillations enhanced by two C-
class ﬂares in AR 11112. The amplitudes increased from 6.1 Mm
to 6.8 Mm after the C1.3 ﬂare and further to 21.4 Mm after the
C2.6 ﬂare, with the period variation being ≤20%. The roles of
ﬂares are additionally conﬁrmed by 1D HD numerical simula-
tions based on the previous works. The simulated amplitudes
and periods are close to the observed values, while the damp-
ing time in the last phase is longer than the observed value, im-
plying additional mechanisms may play a role. Our ﬁndings are
in accordance with the daily experience of playing on a swing.
Before the swing comes to a halt, the amplitude would be ampli-
ﬁed when new momentum is deposited, so that the oscillation is
extended dramatically.

5.2. Relationshipbetween ﬁlament oscillationsand solar

eruptions

The relationship between large-amplitude ﬁlament oscillations
and solar eruptions is still unclear. On one hand, coronal EUV
