A NOTE ON ALMOST RIEMANN SOLITON AND GRADIENT
ALMOST RIEMANN SOLITON

KRISHNENDU DE AND UDAY CHAND DE

Abstract. The quest of the oﬀering article is to investigate almost Riemann
soliton and gradient almost Riemann soliton in a non-cosymplectic normal almost
contact metric manifold M 3. Before all else, it is proved that if the metric of M 3 is
Riemann soliton with divergence-free potential vector ﬁeld Z, then the manifold is
quasi-Sasakian and is of constant sectional curvature -λ, provided α, β = constant.
Other than this, it is shown that if the metric of M 3 is ARS and Z is pointwise
collinear with ξ and has constant divergence, then Z is a constant multiple of ξ and
the ARS reduces to a Riemann soliton, provided α, β =constant. Additionally,
it is established that if M 3 with α, β = constant admits a gradient ARS (γ, ξ, λ),
then the manifold is either quasi-Sasakian or is of constant sectional curvature
−(α2 − β2). At long last, we develop an example of M 3 conceding a Riemann
soliton.

1. Introduction

Since Einstein manifolds play out a huge job in Mathematics and material science,

the examination of Einstein manifolds and their speculations is an intriguing point

in Riemannian and contact geometry. Lately, various generalizations of Einstein

manifolds such as Ricci soliton, gradient Einstein soliton, gradient Ricci soliton,
gradient m-quasi Einstein soliton etc. have researched. The notion of Ricci ﬂow
was introduced by Hamilton [12] and deﬁned by ∂
∂t g(t) = −2S(t), where S denotes
the Ricci tensor.

As a spontaneous generalization, the idea of Riemann ﬂow ([19],[20]) is deﬁned
∂t G(t) = −2Rg(t), G = 1
2 g ⊗ g, where R is the Riemann curvature tensor and ⊗

by ∂

is Kulkarni-Nomizu product (executed as (see Besse [1], p. 47),

(P ⊗ Q)(E, F, Z, W ) = P (E, W )Q(F, U ) + P (F, U )Q(E, W )

−P (E, U )Q(F, W ) − P (F, W )Q(E, U )).

Analogous to Ricci soliton, the entrancing thought of Riemann soliton was promoted

by Hirica and Udriste [13]. As per Hirica and Udriste [13], a Riemannian metric
g on a Riemannian manifold M is called a Riemann solitons if there exists a C ∞
vector ﬁeld Z and a real scalar λ such that

(1.1)

2R + λg ⊗ g + g ⊗ £Z g = 0.

Here we should see that, this new thought of Riemann soliton is nothing but

a generalization of the space of constant sectional curvature. The soliton will be
termed as expanding (if λ > 0), steady (if λ = 0) or shrinking (if λ < 0), respec-
tively. The manifold is said to be gradient Riemann soliton if the vector ﬁeld Z is
gradient of the potential function γ. For this situation the forerunner condition can
be composed as

(1.2)

2R + λg ⊗ g + g ⊗ ∇

2γ = 0,

where ∇2γ denotes the Hessian of γ. In the event that we ﬁx the condition on the
parameter λ to be a variable function, then the equation (1.1) and (1.2) turns in

to ARS and gradient ARS respectively. All through this paper the terminology

“almost Riemann solitons” is composed as ARS.

Riemann solitons and gradient Riemann solitons on Sasakian manifolds have been

investigated in detail by Hirica and Udriste (see, [13]). Furthermore, Riemann’s

soliton concerning inﬁnitesimal harmonic transformation was studied in [18]. In this
association, we notice that Sharma in [16] explored almost Ricci soliton in K-contact
In [6], Riemann
geometry and in [17], with divergence-free soliton vector ﬁeld.

soliton under the context of contact manifold has been studied and demonstrated a

few intriguing outcomes.

Quite a long while prior, in [14], Olszak explored the three dimensional normal
almost contact metric (brieﬂy, acm) manifolds mentioning several examples. After
the citation of [14], in recent years normal acm manifolds have been studied by
numerous eminent geometers (see, [7],[8],[9],[10] and references contained in those).

A NOTE ON SOLITONS

The above studies motivate us to investigate an ARS and the gradient ARS in
a 3-dimensional normal acm manifolds, since 3-dimensional normal acm manifold
covers Sasakian manifold, Cosymplectic manifold, Kenmotsu manifold and Quasi-

Sasakian manifold.

The forthcoming article is structured as:
In section 2, we reminisce about some facts and formulas of normal acm manifolds,
which we will require in later sections. Beginning from Section 3, after giving the

proof, we will engrave our main Theorems. After that, we develop an example of a
3-dimensional normal acm manifold admitting a Riemann soliton. This exposition
terminates with a concise bibliography that has been utilized during the formulation

of the article.

2. Preliminaries

Let M 3 be an acm manifold endowed with a triplet of almost contact structure(η, ξ, φ).

In details, M 3 is an odd-dimensional diﬀerentiable manifold equipped with a global
1-form η , a unique characteristic vector ﬁeld ξ and a (1, 1)-type tensor ﬁeld φ,

respectively, such that

(2.1)

φ2E = −E + η(E)ξ,

η(ξ) = 1,

φξ = 0,

η ◦ φ = 0.

A structure, named almost complex structure J on M × R is deﬁned by

(2.2)

J (E, λ

d
ds

) = (φE − λξ, η(E)

d
ds

),

ds ) indicates a tangent vector on M × R, E and λ d

where (E, λ d
ds being tangent to
M and R respectively. After fulﬁlling the condition, the structure J is integrable,
M (η, ξ, φ) is said to be normal (see, [2],[3]).
The Nijenhuis torsion is deﬁned by

[φ, φ](E, F ) = φ2

[E, F ] + [φE, φF ] − φ[φE, F ] − φ[E, φF ].

The structure (η, ξ, φ) is said to be normal if and only if

(2.3)

[φ, φ] + 2dη ⊗ ξ = 0.

The Riemannian metric g on M 3 is said to be compatible with (η, ξ, φ) if the con-
dition

(2.4)

g(φE, φF ) = g(E, F ) − η(E) η(F ),

4

K.DE AND U.C.DE

holds for any E, F ∈ X(M ). In such case, the quadruple (η, ξ, φ, g) is termed as

an acm structure on M 3 and M 3 is an acm manifold. The equation

(2.5)

η(E) = g(E, ξ),

is withal valid on such a manifold.

Certainly, we can deﬁne the fundamental 2-form Φ by

(2.6)

Φ(E, F ) = g(E, φF ),

where E, F ∈ X(M ).

For a normal acm manifold, we can write [14]:

(2.7)

(2.8)

(∇Eφ)(F ) = g(φ∇Eξ, F ) − η(F )φ∇E ξ,

∇Eξ = α[E − η(E)ξ] − βφE,

2 divξ and β = 1

where α = 1
2 tr(φ ∇ξ), divξ is the divergent of ξ deﬁned by divξ =
trace{E −→ ∇Eξ} and tr(φ∇ξ) = trace{E −→ φ∇Eξ}. Utilizing (2.8) in (2.7) we
lead

(2.9)

(∇E φ)(F ) = α[g(φE, F )ξ − η(F ) φE] + β[g(E, F ) ξ − η(F )E].

Also in this manifold the subsequent relations hold [14]:

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

R(E, F )ξ = [F α + (α2

− β2

)η(F )]φ2E

−[Eα + (α2

− β2

)η(E)]φ2F

+[F β + 2αβη(F )]φE

−[Eβ + 2αβη(E)]φF,

S(E, ξ) = −Eα − (φE)β
−[ξα + 2 (α2

− β2

)] η(E),

ξβ + 2α β = 0,

(2.13)

(∇Eη)(F ) = αg(φE, φF ) − βg(φE, F ).

A NOTE ON SOLITONS

It is well admitted that in a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold the Riemann

curvature tensor is always satisﬁes

(2.14)

R(E, F )Z = S(F, Z)E − S(E, Z)F + g(F, Z)QE − g(E, Z)QF

−

r
2

[g(F, Z)E − g(E, Z)F ].

By (2.10), (2.11) and (2.14) we infer

S(E, F ) = (

r

+ ξα + α2

− β2

)g(φE, φF )

(2.15)

−η(E)(F α + (φF )β) − η(F )(Eα + (φE)β)
−2(α2

)η(E)η(F ).

− β2

For α, β =constant, it follows from the above equation that a 3-dimensional normal
acm manifold becomes an η-Einstein manifold.

From (2.9) we conclude that the manifold is either α-Kenmotsu [11] or cosym-
plectic [2] or β-Sasakian, provided α, β =constant. Also it is well known that a
3-dimensional normal acm manifold reduces to a quasi-Sasakian manifold if and
only if α = 0 (see, [14],[15]).

3. Riemann Soliton

In this segment, we ﬁrst write the subsequent result ([4],[5]):

Lemma 3.1. In a Riemannian manifold if (g, Z) is a Ricci soliton, then we have

(3.1)

2
k£Z gk

2

= dr(Z) + 2div(λZ − QZ).

Now, because of (2.8) we obtain

(3.2)

(£ξg)(E, F ) = 2α{g(E, F ) − η(E) η(F )}.
We consider a normal acm manifold M 3 with α, β =constants admitting a Rie-

mann soliton deﬁned by(1.1). Using Kulkarni-Nomizu product in (1.1) we write

2R(E, F, W, X) + 2λ{g(E, X)g(F, W ) − g(E, W )g(F, X)}

+ {g(E, X)(£Z g)(F, W ) + g(F, W )(£Z g)(U, E)

(3.3)

− g(E, W )(£Z g)(F, X) − g(F, X)(£Z g)(E, W )} = 0.

Contracting (3.3) over E and X, we infer

6

K.DE AND U.C.DE

(3.4)

(£Z g)(F, W ) + 2S(F, W ) + (4λ + 2divZ)g(F, W ) = 0.

Thus Riemann soliton whose potential vector ﬁeld is of vanishing divergence reduces

to Ricci soliton.

Hence we have

(3.5)

(£Z g)(F, W ) + 2S(F, W ) + 4λg(F, W ) = 0.

Setting Z = ξ and utilizing (3.2) we lead

2α{g(F, W ) − η(F )η(W )} + 2S(F, W ) + 4λg(F, W ) = 0,

which implies that

(3.6)

α{F − η(F )ξ} + QF + 2λF = 0.

Putting F = W = ei and taking divZ = 0 from (3.5) we get r = −6λ. Hence in our
case (3.1) takes the form

(3.7)

2
k£Z gk

1
2

= dr(Z) + 2div(−2λZ − QZ).

From (3.6) we get Qξ = −2λξ. Therefore utilizing r = −6λ and Qξ = −2λξ we
obtain from (3.7) ξ is a Killing vector. Hence (3.2) implies α = 0 that is the manifold
is quasi-Sasakian.

Utilizing α = 0 in (3.6), we infer

QF = −2λF,

. Hence from (2.14) we can write that the manifold is of constant sectional curvature
−λ. Therefore we write:

Theorem 3.1. If the metric of a non-cosymplectic normal acm manifold M 3 is
Riemann soliton with a divergence-free potential vector ﬁeld, then the manifold is
quasi-Sasakian and is of constant sectional curvature −λ, provided α, β =constant .

4. Almost Riemann Soliton

Here we consider a normal acm manifold M 3 with α, β =constants admitting an

ARS deﬁned by(1.1).

A NOTE ON SOLITONS

7

In particular, let the potential vector ﬁeld Z be point-wise collinear with ξ (i.e.,
Z = cξ, where c is a function on M ) and has constant divergence. Then from (3.4)
we lead

(4.1)

g(∇E cξ, F ) + g(∇F cξ, E) + 2S(E, F ) + (4λ + 2divZ)g(E, F ) = 0.

Utilizing (2.5) and (2.8) in (4.1), we obtain

(4.2)

2αc[g(E, F ) − η(E) η(F )] + (Ec)η(F ) + (F c)η(E)

+2S(E, F ) + (4λ + 2divZ)g(E, F ) = 0.

Replacing F by ξ in (4.2) and utilizing (2.1), (2.5) and (2.11) gives

(4.3)

(Ec) + (ξc)η(E) − 4(α2

− β2

)η(E) + (4λ + 2divZ)η(E) = 0.

Putting E = ξ in (4.3) and utilizing (2.1) yields

(4.4)

ξc = [2(α2

− β2

) − 2λ − 2divZ].

Putting the value of ξc in (4.3) we infer

(4.5)

dc = [2(α2

− β2

) − 2λ − 2divZ]η.

Applying d on (4.5) and using Poincare lemma d2 ≡0, we lead

(4.6)

[2(α2

− β2

) − 2λ − 2divZ]dη + (dλ)η = 0.

Taking wedge product of (4.6) with η, we obtain

(4.7)

[2(α2

− β2

) − 2λ − 2divZ]η ∧ dη = 0.

Since η ∧ dη 6= 0 , we infer

(4.8)

[2(α2

− β2

) − 2λ − 2divZ] = 0.

Utilizing (4.8) in (4.5) gives dc = 0 i.e., c =constant. Also from (4.8) we have

(4.9)

λ = [(α2

− β2

) − divZ] = constant.

8

K.DE AND U.C.DE

Hence we write the following:

Theorem 4.1. If the metric of a non-cosymplectic normal acm manifold M 3 is ARS
and Z is pointwise collinear with ξ and has constant divergence, then Z is constant
multiple of ξ and the ARS reduces to a Riemann soliton, provided α, β =constant .

Corollary 4.1. If a non-cosymplectic normal acm manifold M 3 with α, β =constant
admits an ARS of type (g, ξ), then the ARS reduces to a Riemann soliton.

5. Gradient Almost Riemann Soliton

In this section we investigate a non-cosymplectic normal acm manifold M 3 with

α, β =constant, admitting gradient ARS. Now we prove the subsequent results:

Lemma 5.1. For a non-cosymplectic normal acm manifold M 3 with α, β =constant,
we have

(5.1)

(∇EQ)ξ = −{

r
2

+ 3(α2

− β2

)}[α{E − η(E)ξ} − βφE].

Proof. For α, β =constants, we get from (2.15)

(5.2)

QF = {

r

+ (α2

− β2

)}F − {

r
2

+ 3(α2

)}η(F )ξ.

Diﬀerentiating (5.2) covariantly in the direction of E and using (2.8) and (2.13),

we get

(5.3)

(∇EQ)F =

(F − η(F )ξ)

dr(E)

− β2

)}[αg(E, F )ξ − 2αη(E)η(F )ξ

+αη(F )E − βg(φE, F )ξ − βη(F )φE].

Replacing F by ξ in (5.3) and utilizing (2.8), we get

(∇EQ)ξ = −{

r
2

+ 3(α2

− β2

)}[α{E − η(E)ξ} − βφE].

(cid:3)

Lemma 5.2. Let M 3(η, ξ, φ, g) be a non-cosymplectic normal acm manifold with
α, β =constant. Then we have

(5.4)

ξr = −4α{

r

Proof. Recalling (5.3), we can write

+αη(F )g(E, Z) − βg(φE, F )η(Z) − βη(F )g(φE, Z)].

Putting E = Z = ei (where {ei} be the orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of M and taking P i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 ) in the foregoing equation and using the so called
formula of Riemannian manifolds divQ = 1

2 grad r, we obtain

(5.6)

(ξr)η(F ) = −4α{

+ 3(α2

− β2

)}η(F ).

r

Replacing F = ξ in the previous equation we have the required result.

(cid:3)

Lemma 5.3. (Lemma. 3.8 of [6]) For any vector ﬁelds E, F on M 3, in a gradient
ARS (M, g, γ, m, λ), we infer

R(E, F )Dγ = (∇F Q)E − (∇EQ)F

(5.7)

+{F (2λ + △γ)E − E(2λ + △γ)F },

where △γ = div Dγ, △ is the Laplacian operator.

Superseding F by ξ in (5.7) and utilizing Lemma 5.1, we get

R(E, ξ)Dγ =

dr(ξ)

[E − η(E)ξ] − {

− β2

)}[2αE − 2αη(E)ξ − βφE]

(5.8)

+{ξ(2λ + △γ)E − E(2λ + △γ)ξ}.

Then utilizing (2.10), we infer

g(E, (α2

Executing inner product of the foregoing equation with ξ yields

(5.10)

E((α2

− β2

)γ + (2λ + △γ)) = {(α2

− β2

)(ξγ) + ξ(2λ + △γ)}η(E),

10

K.DE AND U.C.DE

from which easily we lead

(5.11)

d((α2

− β2

)γ + (2λ + △γ)) = {(α2

− β2

)(ξγ) + ξ(2λ + △γ)}η,

where the exterior derivative is denoted by d. From the above equation we conclude
that (α2 − β2)γ + (2λ + △γ) is invariant along the distribution D . In other terms,
E((α2 − β2)γ + (2λ + △γ)) = 0 for any E ∈ D. Hence utilizing (5.10) in (5.9), we
get

(5.12)

dr(ξ)
2

[E − η(E)ξ] − {

r
2

Contracting the previous equation and using (5.4), we lead

(5.13)

α{

r
2

+ 3(α2

− β2

)} = 0.

Now we split our study in the following cases:

Case (i): If α = 0, then the manifold reduces to a quasi-Sasakian manifold.
case (ii): If r = −6(α2 − β2), then from (2.15) we get S = −2(α2 − β2)g , that
is the manifold is an Einstein manifold and hence from (2.14) it follows that the
manifold is of constant sectional curvature −(α2 − β2). Hence we write:

Theorem 5.1. If a non-cosymplectic normal acm manifold M 3 with α, β =constant
admits a gradient ARS (γ, ξ, λ), then the manifold is either quasi-Sasakian or is of
constant sectional curvature −(α2 − β2).

We consider the manifold M = {(x, y, z) ∈ R3, z 6= 0} and the linearly indepen-

The Riemannian metric g is deﬁned by

g(u1, u3) = g(u1, u2) = g(u2, u3) = 0,

g(u1, u1) = g(u2, u2) = g(u3, u3) = 1.

Let the 1-form η is given by η(E) = g(E, u3) for any E ∈ X(M ) and the tensor

ﬁeld φ is given by

φ(u1) = −u2, φ(u2) = u1, φ(u3) = 0.

A NOTE ON SOLITONS

11

Then utilizing the linearity of φ and g, we infer

η(u3) = 1,

φ2E = −E + η(E)u3,

g(φE, φF ) = g(E, F ) − η(E)η(F ),

for any E, F ∈ X(M ). Obviously, the structure (η, ξ, φ, g) admits an acmstructure
on M 3 for u3 = ξ. Then we lead

[u1, u3] = u1u3 − u3u1

(6.1)

Similarly

[u1, u2] = 0 and [u2, u3] = −u2.

Utilizing Koszul’s formula for the Riemannian metric g, we can calculate

∇u1u3 = −u1, ∇u1u2 = 0, ∇u1u1 = u3,

∇u2u3 = −u2, ∇u2u2 = u3, ∇u2u1 = 0,

(6.2)

∇u3u3 = 0, ∇u3u2 = 0, ∇u3u1 = 0.

From the above expression it is obvious that the manifold under consideration is a
normal acm manifold with α, β=constants, since it satisﬁes (2.8) for α = −1 and
β = 0 and ξ = e3.

It can be easily veriﬁed that

R(u1, u2)u3 = 0, R(u2, u3)u3 = −u2, R(u1, u3)u3 = −u1,

R(u1, u2)u2 = −u1, R(u2, u3)u2 = u3, R(u1, u3)u2 = 0,

R(u1, u2)u1 = u2, R(u2, u3)u1 = 0, R(u1, u3)u1 = u3.

In this example, it is easy to verify that the characteristic vector ﬁeld ξ has

constant divergence and obviously £ξg = 0 . Then equation (3.3) reduces to

(6.3)

2R(E, F )W + 2λ{g(F, W )E − g(E, W )Y } = 0,

12

K.DE AND U.C.DE

for all vector ﬁeld E, F, W . Also equation (6.3)holds for λ = 1. Thus the manifold
under consideration admits a Riemann soliton (g, ξ, λ).
