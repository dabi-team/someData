ABSTRACT

Aims. We investigate the role of the accumulation of magnetic helicity and magnetic energy in the generation of coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) from emerging solar active regions (ARs).
Methods. Using vector magnetic ﬁeld data obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Obser-
vatory, we calculated the magnetic helicity and magnetic energy injection rates as well as the resulting accumulated budgets in 52
emerging ARs from the start time of magnetic ﬂux emergence until they reached a heliographic longitude of 45◦ West (W45).
Results. Seven of the ARs produced CMEs, but 45 did not. In a statistical sense, the eruptive ARs accumulate larger budgets of
magnetic helicity and energy than the noneruptive ARs over intervals that start from the ﬂux emergence start time and end (i) at
the end of the ﬂux emergence phase and (ii) when the AR produces its ﬁrst CME or crosses W45, whichever occurs ﬁrst. We found
magnetic helicity and energy thresholds of 9 × 1041 Mx2 and 2 × 1032 erg. When these thresholds were crossed, ARs are likely to erupt.
In terms of accumulated magnetic helicity and energy budgets, the segregation of the eruptive from the noneruptive ARs is violated in
one case when an AR erupts early in its emergence phase and in six cases in which noneruptive ARs exhibit large magnetic helicity
and energy budgets. Decay index calculations may indicate that these ARs did not erupt because the overlying magnetic ﬁeld provided
a stronger or more extended conﬁnement than in eruptive ARs.
Conclusions. Our results indicate that emerging ARs tend to produce CMEs when they accumulate signiﬁcant budgets of both
magnetic helicity and energy. Any study of their eruptive potential should consider magnetic helicity together with magnetic energy.

1. Introduction

Solar active regions (ARs) are extended areas of the solar atmo-
sphere (in the photosphere, their area ranges from 50 to 100000
Mm2) with a magnetic ﬁeld that is much stronger than that of
their surroundings (see van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015, and
references therein). ARs are formed by the emergence of mag-
netic ﬂux from the interior of the Sun. The ﬁrst step in the for-
mation of a simple bipolar AR is the emergence of an Ω-shaped
ﬂux tube; the intersections of the axial magnetic ﬁeld of the tube
with the photosphere causes the two magnetic polarities of the
AR (see Schmieder et al. 2014; Archontis & Syntelis 2019, and
references therein). During the emergence phase, the two main
polarities move apart and small magnetic elements appear in be-
tween. Diﬀerent bipoles in proximity may interact to form ARs
with more complex conﬁgurations (e.g., Toriumi 2014).

Active regions are the source of explosive phenomena, the
most violent of which are ﬂares (i.e., sudden bursts of elec-
tromagnetic radiation) and coronal mass ejections (CMEs; i.e.,
large-scale expulsions of magnetized coronal plasma propagat-
ing through the heliosphere). These phenomena occur because
both ﬂux emergence (e.g., see Leka et al. 1996) and subsequent
AR evolution may provide a large amount of free magnetic en-
ergy (i.e., the nonpotential part of the magnetic energy due to
electric currents above the photosphere) that can be released via
magnetic reconnection or some instability (e.g., see the review
by Toriumi & Wang 2019).

Because the origin of ﬂares and CMEs is magnetic, any at-
tempt to study them requires an in-depth knowledge of the prop-
erties of the magnetic ﬁeld. One of the key quantities that char-
acterize magnetic ﬁelds is their magnetic helicity. It indicates
how complex the ﬁeld is by measuring the twist, writhe, and
linkage of the ﬁeld lines (e.g., see Pevtsov et al. 2014, and refer-
ences therein). In ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), mag-
netic helicity is a strictly conserved quantity (e.g., see Priest
2014), while in nonideal processes such as magnetic reconnec-
tion, it is conserved to an excellent approximation in plasmas
with high magnetic Reynolds numbers (e.g., see Berger 1984;
Pariat et al. 2015).

Several methods for estimating magnetic helicity have been
developed (see Thalmann et al. 2021, for a comparison). They
include (i) ﬁnite-volume methods (see Valori et al. 2016, for an
extensive review and comparison of ﬁnite-volume methods), (ii)
the connectivity-based method (Georgoulis et al. 2012), (iii) the
twist number method (Guo et al. 2017), and (iv) helicity-ﬂux
integration methods (e.g., Chae 2001; Nindos & Zhang 2002;
Pariat et al. 2005; Dalmasse et al. 2014, 2018). Methods (i) and
(ii) provide the instantaneous magnetic helicity in a given vol-
ume, and the same is true for method (iii), with the exception
that only the contribution of twist to the magnetic helicity is es-
timated. On the other hand, helicity ﬂux integration methods pro-
vide only the helicity injection rate and hence the accumulated
helicity during certain time intervals.

Although the role of free magnetic energy in the initiation of
solar eruptions is well established (e.g., Schrijver 2009), the role
of magnetic helicity is debated. Phillips et al. (2005) have sug-
gested that helicity may not be at the heart of CME initiation pro-
cesses. On the other hand, some authors (e.g., Low 1996) have
conjectured that CMEs are the main agents through which the
corona removes excess helicity. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2006)
and Zhang et al. (2012) have suggested that an upper bound for
the accumulation of magnetic helicity may exist, which, if ex-
ceeded, could create a nonequilibrium state leading to a CME.
Furthermore, Kusano et al. (2003) and Kusano et al. (2004) pro-
posed that the accumulation of a similar amount of positive and
negative helicity can facilitate magnetic reconnection, leading
to eruptive phenomena. Pariat et al. (2017) found that the ratio
of the helicity of the current-carrying magnetic ﬁeld to the total
helicity represents a reliable eruptivity proxy, whereas both the
magnetic energy and total helicity do not.

Observationally, the analysis of diﬀerent data sets supports
the important role of helicity in the initiation of eruptive events
(see Pevtsov et al. 2014, for a review). For example, Nindos &
Andrews (2004) fount that in a statistical sense, the coronal he-
licity resulting from the absolute values of the linear force-free
ﬁeld parameter is higher in ARs that produce major eruptive
ﬂares than in those that produce major conﬁned ﬂares. Similar
conclusions were reached by LaBonte et al. (2007) and Park
et al. (2008, 2010). Furthermore, Tziotziou et al. (2012) used
the connectivity-based method developed by Georgoulis et al.
(2012) and found a signiﬁcant monotonic correlation between
the instantaneous helicity and free magnetic energy of several
ARs. They also found that the eruptive ARs were segregated
from noneruptive ARs in both helicity and free magnetic energy,
with helicity and free energy thresholds for the occurrence of
major ﬂares of 2 × 1042 Mx2 and 4 × 1031 erg, respectively. Nin-
dos et al. (2012) showed that the initiation of major eruptions in a
large emerging AR depended on the accumulation of both helic-
ity and free magnetic energy and not on the temporal evolution
of the variation of the background magnetic ﬁeld with height.
Some authors have reported (see Vemareddy 2017, 2019; Dhakal
et al. 2020) that ARs that inject helicity with a predominant sign
might be source regions of CMEs.

The association between the evolutionary stage of ARs and
the occurrence of CMEs is complex. For example, Zhang et al.
(2008) reported that the association with the emergence phase is
only slightly higher than the association with the decay phase.
Although decaying ARs are capable of producing eruptions, pri-
marily due to magnetic ﬂux cancellation, most of the eruptive
activity often occurs from still emerging and evolving ARs and
around the time at which their magnetic ﬂux attains maximum
values (Choudhary et al. 2013). The motivation of this study is
to investigate the role of accumulation of both magnetic helicity
and magnetic energy in the generation of CMEs from emerging
ARs. Our study will demonstrate for the ﬁrst time using the ﬂux
integration method that critical thresholds of magnetic energy
and helicity exist above which an AR is expected with a fairly
high probability to produce a CME. The next section describes
our data base. Our method is given in Sect. 3, while the prop-
erties of the magnetic helicity and energy content of the ARs
are presented in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we discuss the segregation
of eruptive from noneruptive ARs in both magnetic helicity and
energy. Our conclusions and a summary are presented in Sect. 6.

2. Data set

We compiled a catalog of emerging ARs that appeared on the
solar disk during the ascending phase of solar cycle 24, from
May 2010 to December 2012. The criteria we used to assemble
our catalog were that (1) at the time of their emergence, the ARs
should be located within 45◦ of the central meridian. (2) The
ARs should emerge into relatively quiet photospheric areas with-
out preexisting ARs. The ﬁrst criterion was used to limit severe
projection eﬀects that may compromise magnetic ﬁeld measure-
ments at large central meridian distances. The selection of rela-
tively quiet emergence sites aimed to minimize the contribution
of preexisting strong magnetic ﬁelds to the budgets of the ac-
cumulated magnetic helicity and energy of the ARs. We further
elaborate on this issue in Sec. 3.

For the implementation of the ﬁrst criterion, we assembled a
list of candidate emerging ARs by searching the solar AR reports
compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion (NOAA) from 2010 to 20121. From the candidate ARs, we
further selected those that emerged into the quiet Sun by visu-
ally inspecting monthly “quicklook” full-disk movies2 contain-
ing sketches of so-called HMI active region Patches (HARPs),
which are coherent, enduring magnetic structures on the size
scale of an AR. HARPs are identiﬁed in line-of-sight magne-
tograms obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) instrument on
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al.
2012). Then we constructed time proﬁles of the unsigned mag-
netic ﬂux of the resulting candidate ARs by using actual HMI
magnetograms at a cadence of 12 hours. We kept only those ARs
whose time proﬁles of the ﬂux rose monotonically for at least 18
hours above a low background (see also Schunker et al. 2016).
For each AR, the ﬂux emergence start time was assigned to the
time beginning of that interval.

This procedure yielded a catalog of 52 emerging ARs. It is
presented in Table 1. The two table entries where two NOAA AR
numbers appear (labeled 11466+11468 and 11631+11632) cor-
respond to cases in which the ﬁrst major ﬂux emergence episode
was accompanied by a second episode nearby that also resulted
in the formation of a NOAA AR. However, in each of these
cases, EUV loops in AIA images reveal that the newly formed
ARs are magnetically connected that justiﬁes their treatment as
single entities. In the second column of Table 1 we list the ﬂux
emergence start time (see above), which, in some cases, takes
place before the time of the ﬁrst recording of the AR by NOAA.
The times when the ARs cross heliographic longitude of 45◦
West (hereafter referred to as W45) are given in the third col-
umn of Table 1.

For our study we employed HMI vector magnetic data
(Hoeksema et al. 2014). In particular, we used the so-called
HMI.SHARP_CEA_720s data series (Bobra et al. 2014), which
contains Lambert cylindrical equal-area (CEA) projections of
the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld vector. For this HMI data prod-
uct, the native vector ﬁeld output from the inversion code was
transformed into three spherical heliographic components, Br,
Bθ, and Bφ (Gary & Hagyard 1990), which relate to the helio-
graphic ﬁeld components as [Bx, By, Bz] = [Bφ, −Bθ, Br] (see
Sun 2013), where x, y, and z indicate the solar westward, north-
ward, and vertical directions, respectively. The spatial resolution
of the CEA vector ﬁeld images is 0.03 CEA-degrees, which cor-
respond to about 360 km per pixel at disk center. The cadence

E. Liokati et al.: Magnetic helicity and energy of emerging solar active regions and their erruptivity

of our CEA datacubes was 12 minutes. For each AR, we calcu-
lated the magnetic helicity and energy injection rates from the
time that the relevant Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch
(SHARP) data products become available to the W45 passage
time of the AR.

For the detection of CMEs associated with our ARs, we
used (1) movies of Large Angle and Spectrometric Corona-
graph (LASCO) images that can be found in the LASCO CME
Catalog3 (Gopalswamy et al. 2009) and (2) diﬀerence images
from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA, Lemen et al.
2012; Boerner et al. 2012) instrument on board SDO at 211 Å.
This particular AIA channel was chosen because it shows better
CME-related dimming regions, which were used (together with
the appearance of ascending loops) as proxies for the determina-
tion of the CME sources. Seven of our 52 ARs produced a CME
before W45◦ crossing (hereafter referred to as eruptive ARs) and
45 did not (hereafter referred to as noneruptive ARs; see Col. 8
of Table 1). The ﬂares associated with each AR were obtained
from the GOES catalog of X-ray ﬂares4.

3. Method

For each AR of Table 1, we computed the rates of magnetic he-
licity and magnetic energy injection into the solar atmosphere.
As was mentioned in Sect. 2, these quantities were computed
from the time SHAPR data products became available for the
ARs until the ARs reached a heliographic longitude of W 45◦.
In several cases the SHARP tracking algorithm starts tracking
emerging ARs after their actual emergence, which results in lost
data at the very beginning of the emergence. However, the miss-
ing data had a marginal eﬀect on our results; in selected rep-
resentative ARs, we retrieved the missing early emergence data
from nominal full-disk vector magnetograms and found that the
missing intervals contributed no more than than 0.1% to the total
accumulated helicity and energy values derived by the SHARP
data. Therefore, hereafter the time of the ﬁrst available SHARP
data products is referred to as ﬂux emergence start time.

netic energy across a surface S , like the photosphere, are

gential and normal components of the magnetic ﬁeld in the pho-
tosphere, and V⊥t and V⊥n are the tangential and normal com-
ponents of the velocity V⊥ , which is perpendicular to the ﬁeld
lines. The ﬁrst terms of the right-hand side of Equations (1)
and (2) give the magnetic helicity and energy ﬂux, respectively,
caused by the emergence of twisted ﬁeld lines that cross the pho-
tosphere, while the second terms give the generation of helicity
and energy ﬂux, respectively, caused by the shearing and braid-
ing of the magnetic ﬁeld lines by the tangential motions on the
solar surface.

The vector velocity ﬁeld was derived by applying the dif-
ferential aﬃne velocity estimator for vector magnetograms
(DAVE4VM; Schuck 2008) method to sequential coaligned pairs
of the Bx, By, and Bz data cubes (see Sec. 2). The size of the
apodization window we used was 19 pixels, as suggested by
Schuck (2008). These velocities were corrected (e.g., see Liu &
Schuck 2012; Liu et al. 2014) by removing the irrelevant con-
tribution from the magnetic-ﬁeld-aligned plasma ﬂow using the
formula

V⊥ = V −

V · B

where V⊥ is the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, and
V is the velocity derived from DAVE4VM. We used the velocity
V⊥ to calculate the helicity and energy ﬂuxes.

We calculated the helicity ﬂux for each AR by integrating
the so-called Gθ helicity ﬂux density proxy (suggested by Pariat
et al. 2005, 2006) over the portion of the photosphere covered by
the AR. For the Gθ calculations, we employed the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) method proposed by Liu & Schuck (2013) be-
cause it is faster than the direct integrations involved in the deﬁ-
nition of Gθ. By applying both methods to selected pairs of vec-
tor magnetic ﬁeld data, we conﬁrmed that they yield very similar
results (diﬀerences smaller than 2%), in agreement with previ-
ous results derived by Liu & Schuck (2013) and Thalmann et al.
(2021). Finally, the accumulated changes in helicity, ∆H, and
magnetic energy, ∆E, were computed by integrating the mag-
netic helicity and energy ﬂuxes, respectively, over time. In Cols.
4-5 and 6-7 we list the ∆H and ∆E budgets, respectively, for two
intervals for each AR: (i) the interval of ﬂux emergence, and (ii)
the interval from ﬂux emergence start time until the AR produces
its ﬁrst CME or crosses W45, whichever occurs ﬁrst.

The magnetic helicities and energies reported in this pa-
per were derived using all pixels of the relevant vector magne-
tograms. For test purposes in selected representative cases, we
followed Bobra et al. (2014) and took only those pixels into ac-
count that were within the corresponding HARP and were as-
signed the highest conﬁdence disambiguation solutions. This al-
ternative approach yielded results smaller by about 0.5% com-
pared to those derived from the full data. This shows that the bulk
of helicity and energy ﬂuxes is provided by the intense magnetic
polarities (see also Thalmann et al. 2021). In Sect. 5 we address
the issue of the uncertainties related to the calculation of mag-
netic helicity and energy budgets. On the other hand, the calcula-
tion of magnetic ﬂuxes is sensitive to the imposed Bz cutoﬀ value
because we calculate the unsigned magnetic ﬂux, and diﬀerent
cutoﬀs will allow diﬀerent numbers of pixels to be accountable
for in the unsigned magnetic ﬂux measurements. Therefore, the
resulting ﬂux depends on the number of used pixels (or Bz cut-
oﬀ). To this end, we followed the prescription by Bobra et al.
(2014) mentioned above when we calculated magnetic ﬂuxes.

When we computed the magnetic helicity and energy bud-
gets, we assumed that both quantities were strictly zero at the be-
ginning of observations; that is, the budgets were calculated by
merely integrating the helicity and energy ﬂuxes, respectively,
over time. This approach is justiﬁed by the very low values of
both quantities when ﬂux emergence starts. This was veriﬁed in
selected representative ARs for which we computed the linear
force-free parameter, α (∇ × B = αB with α being constant over
the AR; see, e.g., Alissandrakis 1981) at ﬂux emergence start
time. This was done by ﬁtting the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld
lines with the AR loops that appear in AIA 195 Å images. The

value of α providing the best overall ﬁt between the extrapola-
tions and observations (e.g., see Pevtsov et al. 2003; Nindos &
Andrews 2004) was used to compute the instantaneous magnetic
helicity (see Démoulin et al. 2002; Green et al. 2002) and energy
(see Georgoulis & LaBonte 2007). In agreement with Pevtsov
et al. (2003), our calculations yielded very low values of α (about
10−8 m−1), and the resulting values of magnetic helicity and en-
ergy were about 1% of their maximum accumulated values. Be-
cause helicity is well conserved in the corona and is primarily
removed by CMEs (see Sect. 1), its instantaneous value at any
given time prior to the initation of the ﬁrst AR CME should be
equal to its computed accumulated value. However, this is not
the case for the magnetic energy, which is dissipated via recon-
nection events. We return to this point in Sect. 5.

4. Properties of the magnetic helicity and energy

content of the ARs

Indicative examples of the evolution of the magnetic conﬁgu-
ration of the ARs are presented in Figs. 1-4, where we show
snapshots of the normal component (Bz) of the magnetic ﬁeld
of two eruptive ARs (11422 and 11465 in Figs 1 and 2, respec-
tively) and two noneruptive (11143 and 11327 in Figs 3 and 4,
repsectively) ARs. The majority of the ARs we studied (39 out
of 52) were largely bipolar throughout the interval we tracked
them (see Figs 1, 3 and 4). In the remaining 13, deviations from
bipolar conﬁguration were observed at certain intervals exceed-
ing 24 hours (see Fig. 2, from panels (e) to (j), where the western
sunspot eventually develops a delta conﬁguration). We note that
5 out of the 7 eruptive ARs deviated from bipolarity, in agree-
ment with previous results that highlight the complex photo-

In all cases, the AR formation was accompanied by the sep-
aration of magnetic polarities over time, as is clearly shown

in Figs 1-4. This is one of the most traditional signatures of
magnetic ﬂux emergence (e.g., see the discussion in van Driel-
Gesztelyi & Green 2015, and in references therein). In the vicin-
ity of the AR polarity inversion lines (PIL), the most common
motion included the shearing along the PIL, as shown in Figs. 1-
4. Rotation of magnetic polarities is also occasionally observed
(e.g., in Fig. 2, see the evolution of the western sunspot from
panel (e) to panel (j)), and so are magnetic cancellation and con-
verging motions (e.g., see the gradual disappearance of the mag-
netic patches south of the western sunspot of Fig. 1 from panel
(d) to panel (h), as well as the weakening of the eastermost pos-
itive and negative magnetic patches from panel (f) to panel (h)
of Fig. 2). All these motions may inject or redistribute free mag-
netic energy and helicity into the system; we refer to Patsourakos

et al. (2020) for a recent review of the relevant physical mecha-
nisms.

Before computing the magnetic helicity and energy bud-
gets of the ARs, we evaluated their rate of magnetic ﬂux emer-
gence, r, as well as their maximum magnetic ﬂux content, Φmax.
The ﬁrst was calculated at the interval, ∆t, where magnetic
ﬂux was rising monotonically. If the magnetic ﬂuxes at the
start and end of that interval are Φ1 and Φ2, respectively, then
r = (Φ2−Φ1)/∆t. The ﬂux emergence rate lay in the interval [0.6,
10.9] ×1016 Mx s−1 , in agreement with previous results (e.g., see
Otsuji et al. 2011), and its mean value was (4.0 ± 2.4) × 1016 Mx
s−1. We note that the eruptive ARs were associated with some-
what higher magnetic ﬂux emergence rates than the noneruptive
ARs ((5.6 ± 1.9) × 1016 Mx s−1 and (3.7 ± 2.5) × 1016 Mx s−1,
respectively). The uncertainties reported here are the root mean
square (rms) of the r and Φmax (see below) distributions.

The maximum magnetic ﬂux of the ARs lay in the range of
[0.9, 34.3] ×1021 Mx, and their mean value was (8.9±7.5)×1021
Mx. In most cases, ﬂux emergence was followed by an extended
interval (usually lasting until the end of the observations) with
smaller magnetic ﬂux changes (see the top panels of Figs. 5,
6, and 8). However, at the low-end part of the Φmax distribu-
tion, there are ARs whose decay starts well before the end of the
observations. One example, AR 11143, is given in Figs. 3 and
7; the magnetic ﬂux time proﬁle of Fig. 7 starts decreasing less
than 12 hours after it attained magnetic ﬂux maximum. However,
these regions cannot qualify as ephemeral ARs because they last

longer and contain more magnetic ﬂux than typical ephemeral
ARs (according to the traditional deﬁnition provided by Harvey
& Martin 1973, ephemeral ARs last 1-2 days and contain mag-
netic ﬂux of about 1020 Mx). The high-end part of the Φmax dis-
tribution is populated by ARs that produce CMEs or/and ﬂares.
For example, the mean value of the maximum magnetic ﬂux of
the ARs that produced CMEs was (20.2 ± 9.2) × 1021 Mx.

Seven ARs produced CMEs (see Table 1); furthermore, 16
ARs produced ﬂares with an X-ray class above C1.0 (all 7
ARs that produced CMEs also produced ﬂares above C1.0).
We are interested in the ﬁrst CME produced by the ARs here;
in two cases, these CMEs were associated with M-class ﬂares,
and in ﬁve cases, they were associated with C-class ﬂares. The
total number of ﬂares above C1.0 was 98; of these, 83 (i.e.,
about 85%) occurred during either the ﬂux emergence interval
or around the time of maximum magnetic ﬂux. This is clearly
shown in the examples of Figs. 5 and 6 (see the location of the
black arrows above the time axis). This result agrees with pre-
vious publications (e.g., see van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015,
and references therein). On the other hand, ﬁve CMEs occurred
during either the ﬂux emergence interval (see Fig. 5 for an ex-
ample) or around the time of maximum magnetic ﬂux, and the
remaining two occurred well after the AR attained its maximum
magnetic ﬂux (see Fig. 6 for an example). Overall, ﬂares tend to
occur earlier than CMEs: the ﬁrst ﬂare (CME) occurs on aver-
age 1.6 (3.2) days after the start of ﬂux emergence. These results
are consistent with the well-known fact (e.g., see Démoulin et al.

Article number, page 7 of 13

2002) that CMEs may occur at any stage during the evolution of
ARs.

ﬁnding because our data set contained too few ARs that were all
observed during the early phase of cycle 24.

A&A proofs: manuscript no. ms_ﬁnal

The signs of the magnetic helicity budgets that we derived
are reliable. This statement is made because there is extensive
discussion about the most suitable magnetic helicity ﬂux density
proxy (e.g., see Pariat et al. 2005, 2006; Dalmasse et al. 2014,
2018). Although diﬀerent proxies may yield diﬀerent helicity
ﬂux density distributions for a given data set, the total helic-
ity ﬂux (which is the quantity that we record) remains the same
(Pariat et al. 2005; Dalmasse et al. 2014).

The majority of ARs have negative helicity in the northern
hemisphere and positive helicity in the southern hemisphere; this
is the so-called hemispheric helicity rule that was ﬁrst postulated
by Hale et al. (1919) and was rediscovered by Seehafer (1990)
and Pevtsov et al. (1995). Although this rule is well established
(see Park et al. 2020, for more recent references), a rather lim-
ited number of publications have appeared (e.g., see Smyrli et al.
2010) that studied the possible changes (or the absence thereof)
of the helicity sign during the evolution of individual ARs. Our
calculations provide the opportunity to examine this issue and its
possible relation with ﬂares and CMEs.

The ﬁrst question in this problem is the temporal scale. Be-
cause our data set consists of emerging ARs, it appears reason-
able to ﬁrst compare the sign of the accumulated helicity dur-
ing the emergence interval, ∆Hemerg, against the helicity, ∆HW45
accumulated throughout the tracking interval, that is, from ﬂux
emergence start time until the AR crosses W45. We found that
in 45 out of the 52 ARs the sign did not change (see panel (iii) of
Figs. 5 and 7), whereas in 7 ARs it did change (see panel (iii) of
Figs. 6 and 8). In the latter cases, the sign change resulted from
the sign change in helicity injection rate (see panel (ii) of Figs. 6
and 8). In 13 of the 45 ARs, we registered intervals longer than
6 hours with an opposite sign of the helicity injection rate. This
did not aﬀect the ﬁnal signs of either ∆Hemerg or ∆HW45. In most
of the 7 + 13 = 20 ARs the sign change in helicity injection rate
occurred during the emergence interval. This result is broadly
consistent with that reported by Liu et al. (2014), who found that
43% of their sample of 28 emerging ARs showed a change in
helicity injection rate sign during emergence.

Of the 45 ARs with a stable helicity sign, 35 (∼78%) obeyed
the hemispheric helicity rule. If we take the whole sample into
account, the signs of ∆Hemerg or ∆HW45 obey the hemispheric
helicity rule in 39 and 38 ARs (75% and 73%), respectively. The
percentages we found agree with the results reported by Park
et al. (2020) for the ascending phase of solar cycle 24.

From the populations of 7 and 16 ARs that produced CMEs
and ≥ C1-class ﬂares, respectively (see above), 6 and 13 ARs,
respectively, showed stable signs of accumulated helicity in the
sense of the previous discussion (see Fig. 5 and 6 for an example
and counterexample, respectively). Their percentages are simi-
lar to the corresponding percentages of the general population of
ARs. We note that at the time at which all CMEs and ﬂares that
were registered occured in the ARs (with the minor exception of
two C-class ﬂares from AR 11465; see Fig. 6), the sign of the
helicity injection rate was the same as that of the correspond-
ing ∆Hemerg or ∆HW45 value, whichever was relevant. Overall,
our results do not show any evidence for an impulsive injection
of helicity of opposite sign, in disagreement with a few previ-
ous reports (e.g., see Moon et al. 2002). This conclusion does
not change even if we consider the dH/dt curves prior to their
smoothing. We also note that by analyzing a large data set of
ARs, Park et al. (2021) have found that the highest ﬂaring activ-
ity tends to occur in heliographic regions that follow the hemi-
spheric helicity rule only little. We were not able to check this

Article number, page 8 of 13

We also studied the contribution of the shear term and emer-
gence term of eq. (1) and (2) to the magnetic helicity and energy
accumulated into the corona. We found that in our ARs, the shear
term contributes 83% of the helicity and 45% of the energy on
average in terms of their absolute values, while the emergence
term contributes 17% of the helicity and 55% of the energy on
average. This situation is reﬂected in panels (ii)-(iv) of Figs. 5-8,
where the time proﬁles of the shear and emerging term contri-
butions to the dH/dt, ∆H, dE/dt, and ∆E are given by the gold
and green curves, respectively. These results are consistent with
those reported by Liu & Schuck (2012); Liu et al. (2014). We
refer to these papers for the interpretation of the results.

5. Magnetic helicity-energy diagram

5.1. Magnetic helicity and energy thresholds for eruptivity

From our magnetic energy and helicity computations we con-
structed scatter plots of the accumulated amount of these quan-
tities. In general, our computations do not provide instantaneous
values of these budgets (cf. Sect. 3 for the relevant discussion of
the helicity budgets acquired before any CME activity), therefore
the intervals in which the accumulated budgets are assessed for
the scatter plots can in principle be selected arbitrarily. However,
in order to treat the budgets in the same way, it is reasonable to
use two intervals for each AR (see columns 4-7 of Table 1) that
both start from the beginning of the observations and end (i) at
the end of the ﬂux emergence phase, and (ii) at the time when
the AR produces its ﬁrst CME or crosses W45, whichever occurs
ﬁrst. For each eruptive AR, interval (ii) is therefore bounded by
the start time of observations and the time of CME occurrence,
while for each noneruptive AR, it corresponds to the whole ob-
servation period. The absolute values of these amounts are re-
ported in columns 4-7 of Table 1, and the corresponding scat-
ter plots are presented in Fig. 9. The selection of intervals (i)
is justiﬁed by the fact that they represent an important common
evolutionary stage that is exhibited by all ARs, while intervals
(ii) are the longest intervals for which the accumulated helicities
of eruptive ARs correspond to instantaneous helicity budgets. If
there is no CME, intervals (ii) yield the terminal budgets of both
magnetic helicity and energy.

The plots of Fig. 9 (hereafter referred to as E-H diagrams)
show an overall trend (albeit with some scatter that may partly
arise from the fact that the intervals employed for the calcula-
tions of the accumulated quantities changed over the sample of
ARs) under which both magnetic helicity and energy increase
together. The least-squares best logarithmic ﬁts are

|∆H| = (1.74 ± 2.732) × 1012∆E0.931±0.087

and

|∆H| = (2.50 ± 3.224) × 1012∆E0.700±0.102

for the pairs of the left and right panel of Fig. 9, respec-
tively. Equations (4) and (5) have signiﬁcance levels of the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic of about 0.70 and 0.86, respec-
tively. We note that the magnetic helicity, H - free energy, Ec,
diagram constructed by Tziotziou et al. (2012) from instanta-
neous values of these quantities was ﬁtted with a scaling of the
form |H| ∝ 1.37 × 1014E0.897
with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov sig-
niﬁcance level of about 0.7.

E. Liokati et al.: Magnetic helicity and energy of emerging solar active regions and their erruptivity

Fig. 9: Scatter plots of the accumulated amounts of magnetic energy vs absolute helicity during the ﬂux emergence intervals of the
ARs (left panel) and during the intervals from emergence start times until the ARs cross W45 or produce their ﬁrst CME, whichever
occurs ﬁrst (right panel). The red squares and black crosses correspond to eruptive and noneruptive ARs, respectively. The blue
dashed lines deﬁne the thresholds for magnetic helicity and energy above which ARs show a high probability to erupt. The green
lines show the least-squares best logarithmic ﬁts (equations 4 and 5).

Probably the most important feature of the scatter plots of
Fig. 9 is that the eruptive ARs tend to appear in the top right part
of the E-H diagrams. The trend is better visible in the left panel,
where the ∆Eemerg versus ∆Hemerg scatter plot is presented. In it,
all seven eruptive ARs have helicity and energy budgets above
9 × 1041 Mx2 and 2 × 1032 erg, respectively.

These threshold values for the magnetic helcity and energy
divide each plot of Fig. 9 into four regions, marked (i)-(iv). The
vast majority of ARs lie in regions (i) and (iii), which contain
populations with high (low) helicity and high (low) magnetic en-
ergy, respectively. This reﬂects the overall monotonic magnetic
energy - helicity dependence. In both panels of Fig. 9, regions
(ii) and (iv) contain fewer ARs, which may be a consequence of
either the typical scatter in the E-H diagram or of the appearance
of ARs with a comparable amount of both senses of helicity, re-
spectively. The very small number of points in regions (iv) indi-
cates that in a statistical sense, most ARs that are highly charged
with magnetic energy exhibit a well-deﬁned dominant sense of
helicity (see also Pariat et al. 2006; Tziotziou et al. 2012).

The helicity threshold we derived is consistent with that de-
rived by Tziotziou et al. (2012), which was 2 × 1042 Mx2. Fur-
thermore, our inferred threshold for magnetic helicity is broadly
consistent with the maximum likelihood value of the helicity dis-
tribution of magnetic clouds, which is 6.3 × 1042 Mx2, according
to Patsourakos & Georgoulis (2016), who compiled calculations
published by Lynch et al. (2003) and Lepping et al. (2006). Due
to the conserved nature of helicity, the magnetic cloud helicity
is considered as a proxy to the helicity carried away by its par-
ent CME. This argument is supported by the overall agreement
between the helicities of the source region and the associated
magnetic cloud (although with signiﬁcant uncertainties; e.g., see
Green et al. 2002; Nindos et al. 2003; Luoni et al. 2005; Man-
drini et al. 2005; Kazachenko et al. 2012).

Tziotziou et al. (2012) derived a magnetic free energy thresh-
old of 4 × 1031 erg, which is a factor of 5 smaller than ours. Here
two remarks are in place. First, our calculations of the magnetic

energy injection rate include both its free and potential parts
(see Liu & Schuck 2012; Liu et al. 2014). Second, during any
given interval, the ARs dissipate magnetic free energy in various
quantities, ranging from the weakest microﬂares whose detec-
tion limit is determined by the speciﬁcations of the instrument
(see Nindos et al. 2020, for previous and recent references) to,
possibly, ﬂares above C1.0 and CMEs. In a study of AR mi-
croﬂares that were observed by the Ramaty High Energy Solar
Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), Christe et al. (2008) found that
their power was lower than 1026 erg s−1 on average. If we take
into account that the ﬁrst CME in our eruptive ARs occurred 3.2
days after the start of ﬂux emergence on average, we conclude
that the weak ﬂaring events that occurred in this interval may re-
quire an amount of energy lower than 2.8 × 1031 erg. In addition
to this energy, one should take into account the energy required
by possible ﬂares above C1.0. In terms of the released energy,
the most ﬂare-productive AR of our data set was AR 11158 (see
Tziotziou et al. 2013, for a study of its magnetic helicity and en-
ergy budgets) which generated two C-class (C1.1 and C4.7) and
an M6.6-class ﬂare before its ﬁrst CME. Shibata et al. (2013)
argued that the energy of a C1.0, M1.0, and X1.0 class ﬂare is
roughly 1029, 1030, and 1031 erg, respectively. With these rough
estimates, the total energy content of the three ﬂares was about
7.2×1030 erg. If we add the amount required for the small events,
the amount is 3.5 × 1031 erg. Aschwanden et al. (2014) studied
several large ﬂares and reported that the ratio of the free mag-
netic energy to the potential energy may range from 0.01 to 0.25.
Therefore our magnetic energy threshold could broadly accom-
modate both the free magnetic energy required for ﬂaring activ-
ity and the underlying potential energy.

The appearance of the eruptive ARs in the top right corner of
the E-H diagrams indicates that ARs with an accumulated mag-
netic helicity and energy above 9 × 1041 Mx2 and 2 × 1032 erg
are more likely to erupt than those ARs that contain lower val-
ues of accumulated magnetic helicity and energy. We used the
φ coeﬃcient to evaluate the statistical signifant of this result.

licity are poor indicators of the AR approach to the threshold
of instability and only the ratio of current-carrying to total he-
licity is a good indicator. The study by Pariat et al. (2017) can
be understood as an attempt to address the question of whether
there is a well-deﬁned value of ﬂux-normalized helicity that
completely segregates eruptive from noneruptive ARs; all of the
ARs should erupt above a certain value. In this sense, we tested
a weaker hypothesis, namely, whether there is a well-deﬁned
value of ∆H (or ∆H/Φ2) above which ARs are more likely to
erupt. Fig. 10 shows that the likelihood of an eruption increases
above ∆H/Φ2 = 0.014 because it is zero below this value. In
this sense, ∆H/Φ2 behaves absolutely similarly to ∆H. However,
when ∆H/Φ2 lies in the range of about [0.014, 0.028] , no clear
statement about the eruptivity of the ARs can be made because
this range is populated by signiﬁcant fractions of eruptive and
noneruptive ARs. Therefore, ∆H/Φ2 does not possess a critical
value that completely segregates the stability domain from the
instability domain. Our results indicate that a range of ∆H/Φ2
values may exist that includes this boundary. In this sense, our
results partially agree with the relevant conclusion of Pariat et al.
(2017).

We conclude this subsection with some remarks about the
uncertainties of the magnetic helicity and energy calculations.
The uncertainties in the calculations of dH/dt and dE/dt were
evaluated using selected pairs of vector magnetic ﬁeld data that
yielded representative values of dH/dt and dE/dt (from 1035 to
1038 Mx2 s−1 for the helicity ﬂux and from 1025 to 1028 erg s−1
for the energy ﬂux). Brieﬂy, we used the Monte Carlo experi-
ment approach described by Liu & Schuck (2012) and Liu et al.
(2014) and found that the relative errors quantiﬁed by the ratio of
the standard deviation σdH/dt (or σdE/dt) to the absolute value of
the mean dH/dt (or dE/dt, respectively) increased as the mean
magnetic helicity or energy ﬂux values decreased (see Park et al.
2020), but they never exceeded 30%. The resulting errors in the
accumulated helicity or energy were almost two orders of mag-
nitude smaller than the relevant accumulated quantity. These re-
sults are consistent with those reported by Liu & Schuck (2012)
and indicate that the uncertainties in our calculations could not
challenge the location of the ARs in the E-H diagrams of Fig. 9
and 10 with respect to the helicity (either total or ﬂux normal-
ized) and energy thresholds.

5.2. Deviations

The segregation of the eruptive ARs from the noneruptive ARs
in the E-H diagrams of Fig. 9 is not complete. The left panel of
Fig. 9 shows three noneruptive ARs that are located in region (i)
of the E-H diagram. The right panel of Fig. 9 shows one erup-
tive AR (NOAA 11422; see Fig. 1) that is located in region (iii),
which is populated by the vast majority of the noneruptive ARs,
and there are also six noneruptive ARs in region (i) of the dia-
gram. In this subsection we investigate possible reasons for these
deviations.

The appearance of AR11422 in region (iii) in the right panel
of Fig. 9 is a direct consequence of the occurrence of its CME
early on in the ﬂux emergence phase (about 1.4 days from the
ﬂux emergence start time; see Fig. 5) before the AR accumulates
signiﬁcant magnetic helicity and energy budgets. Although this
is the only AR of our sample that exhibited this behavior, it is
well known (e.g., see Nitta & Hudson 2001; Nindos & Zhang
2002; Zhang & Wang 2002) that occasionally, ARs can produce
major eruptions early in their ﬂux emergence phase.

Fig. 10: Same as the right panel of Fig. 9, but the magnetic ﬂux-
normalized absolute accumulated helicity (|∆H|/Φ2) is presented
instead of |∆H|.

This coeﬃcient is related to χ2 values via χ2 = nφ2 (e.g., see
Klimov 1986) (n is 52, i.e., the number of ARs), which can then
be compared to tabulated values of χ2 with one degree of free-
dom. For the data appearing in the left panel of Fig. 9, we found
χ2 = 44.83, which means that the null hypothesis (i.e., that the
production of a CME and the strength of the magnetic helicity
and energy in an AR are not correlated) can be rejected at the
100% conﬁdence level. For the data of the right panel of Fig. 9,
we found χ2 = 25.25, and the null hypothesis can be rejected at
the 99.999997% conﬁdence level. We note that if only one of the
thresholds (no matter which) is taken into account and the val-
ues of either panel of Fig. 9 are used, the null hypothesis is also
rejected at a conﬁdence level of about 99.999%. This means that
each threshold, even if taken separately, can serve as a reliable
indicator of AR eruptivity. This result is consistent with previ-
ous results on AR eruptivity, which highlight either the central
role of the magnetic energy (e.g., see Priest 2014, and references
therein) or solely invoke a magnetic helicity threshold (see Sect.
1 for references).

We also calculated an E-H diagram similar to the diagram
presented in the right panel of Fig. 9, but instead of the absolute
value of the accumulated helicity, |∆H|, we used the magnetic
ﬂux-normalized absolute helicity, |∆H|/Φ2, where Φ is the mag-
netic ﬂux when the AR crosses W45 or produces its ﬁrst CME.
To ﬁrst approximation, this quantity reﬂects the structure of the
magnetic ﬁeld, while ∆H reﬂects both the structure and the mag-
netic ﬂux content (the helicity of an isolated, uniformly twisted
magnetic ﬂux tube with N turns and magnetic ﬂux Φ is NΦ2).
The results of our computations are shown in Fig. 10. The de-
gree of segregation of the eruptive ARs from the noneruptive
ARs is similar to the degree in Fig. 9. This visual impression is
conﬁrmed by our statistical analysis, which shows that by using
∆H/Φ2, the null hypothesis is again rejected at a conﬁdence level
of ∼99.9999%. In Fig. 10 all eruptive ARs exhibit |∆H|/Φ2 in
the range [0.014, 0.096]. These values are consistent with those
reported in the literature (e.g., see Patsourakos et al. 2020, and
references therein).

Some authors (e.g., Pariat et al. 2017; Thalmann et al. 2019)
have argued that both helicity and magnetic ﬂux-normalized he-

For the six ARs that intrude into region (i) in the right panel

9, that is, the time of the ﬁrst CME if the AR is eruptive or the
time of W45 crossing if the AR is noneruptive. The ﬁrst step in
the computation was to extrapolate the coronal magnetic ﬁeld
using the observed photospheric Bz magnetograms as boundary
conditions. Because we were interested in the large-scale struc-
ture of the overlying ﬁeld, we employed potential extrapolations
using the method by Alissandrakis (1981) (we note that Nindos
et al. 2012, have shown that to ﬁrst approximation, potential and
nonlinear force-free ﬁeld extrapolations yield similar decay in-
dex trends). The size of the base of the extrapolation volume was
equal to the size of the Bz magnetogram. and its height was 160
Mm. The decay index was computed using equation (6), and the
extrapolated ﬁeld within a computation box whose base encom-
passed the main polarity inversion line of the AR and its height
was the height of the extrapolation volume. For each height, the
average value of the decay index was used in our study.

In Fig. 11 we show scatter plots of the accumulated bud-
gets of magnetic helicity and enery that were registered in the
right panel of Fig. 9 versus the height at which the decay in-
dex reached the critical value of 1.5. This value is relevant when
a magnetic ﬂux rope becomes torus unstable, whereas we did
not investigate the existence of magnetic ﬂux ropes in our ARs.
However, even if some ARs lack ﬂux ropes, the comparison of
the heights at which the decay indices reach a common refer-
ence value, nc, may provide information about the restraining
potential of the overlying ﬁeld. Fig. 11 shows that both the mag-
netic helicity and energy budgets spread all over the nc heights.
However, the noneruptive ARs of region (i) in the right panel
of Fig. 9 tend to acquire nc = 1.5 at larger heights (> 60 Mm)
than most eruptive ARs (compare the locations of the red boxes
and the green diamonds). The same conclusion is reached if the
ﬂux-normalized accumulated helicity is used instead of the ac-
cumulated helicity because the noneruptive ARs in the top right
quarter of Figs. 9 (right) and 10 are largely the same; the scatter
plot of ∆H/Φ2 versus critical height is very similar to the bottom
panel of Fig. 11 regarding the segregation of the green diamonds
from the red squares. Our result indicates that in ARs with sig-
niﬁcant helicity and energy budgets, the background ﬁeld tends
to provide stronger conﬁnement in the ARs that did not produce
CMEs than in those that produce a CME. Our result is broadly
consistent with the work by Vasantharaju et al. (2018) , who
studied 77 ﬂare-CME events and reported that in 90% of erup-
tive ﬂares the decay index reached nc = 1.5 within 42 Mm, while
it was beyond 42 Mm in ∼70% of conﬁned ﬂares.

6. Summary and conclusions

We computed the magnetic helicity and energy injection rates as
well as the resulting accumulated budgets of 52 emerging ARs
over intervals that start at the ﬂux emergence start time and end
when the ARs cross W45. The instantaneous helicity is very low
when ﬂux emergence starts, and therefore the conservation of
helicity in the corona dictates that the accumulated helicity bud-
gets provide estimates of the instantaneous helicity content of an
AR at any time until the possible occurrence of the ﬁrst CME.
On the other hand, this is not the case for the magnetic energy,
which is dissipated due to reconnection events.

During the tracking intervals, 7 ARs produced CMEs and 45
did not. All but one of the CME-producing ARs exhibited sign-
unchanging budgets of accumulated helicity during the compu-
tations. For one of these ARs (AR11560), this was ﬁrst noted by
Vemareddy (2015). We also note that in the one eruptive AR of
our sample that exhibited helicity sign change during the obser-
vations, the CME occurred well after the sign reversal (see Fig.

magnetic ﬁeld inhibited eruptions. It is well known that a mag-
netic ﬂux rope tends to erupt due to the Lorentz self-force (Chen
1989), but the overlying ﬁeld provides the restraining Lorentz
force to keep the balance of the ﬂux rope. If the overlying mag-
netic ﬁeld decreases fast with height, then the so-called torus
instability develops (Kliem & Török 2006), which may lead to a
CME. The rate at which the overlying ﬁeld decreases with height
is quantiﬁed by its decay index, n, deﬁned by

where Bh is the horizontal component (Bh =
y) of the
overlying ﬁeld and z is the height above the photosphere. The
nominal critical decay index for the initiation of the torus insta-
bility of a magnetic ﬂux rope is nc ≈ 1.5 (Kliem & Török 2006;
Olmedo & Zhang 2010; Cheng et al. 2011).

6), allowing the AR to accumulate signiﬁcant helicity and energy
budgets.

For each AR, we further assessed the accumulated mag-
netic helicity and energy budgets in two intervals: (i) the ﬂux
emergence phase, and (ii) the interval until the ﬁrst CME if the
AR was eruptive, or the whole observing period if the AR was
not eruptive. The results appear in columns 4-7 of Table 1 and
in more concise form in Table 2. The produced E-H diagrams
(Fig. 9) show a partial segregation of the eruptive ARs from
the noneruptive ARs; the former tend to appear in the top right
part of the scatter plots, which reﬂects their larger budgets of
magnetic helicity and energy. The same conclusion was reached
when we considered the ﬂux-normalized helicity instead of the
helicity.

The E-H diagrams indicate that if magnetic helicity and en-
ergy thresholds of 9×1041 Mx2 and 2×1032 erg, are crossed, ARs
are likely to erupt. The helicity threshold is consistent with the
one derived by Tziotziou et al. (2012) using instantaneous helic-
ity budgets as well as with published reports of the helicity con-
tents of CMEs and magnetic clouds. On the other hand, the high
value of the magnetic energy threshold reﬂects both the nonin-
stantaneous nature of its budgets and the fact that these budgets
contain not only the free magnetic energy, but also the potential
energy. The magnetic energy threshold may account for the po-
tential energy contribution and the dissipation of energy due to
reconnection events throughout the interval until the ﬁrst CME.
The segregation of the eruptive from the noneruptive ARs in
the E-H diagrams is not perfect. The sources of the violations are
as follows:

(1) In one case, an AR erupts early on during its emergence
phase without having the opportunity to accumulate signiﬁcant
helicity and energy budgets. It is possible that the eruption oc-
curred as a result of reconnection between the newly emerged
ﬂux and the preexisting ﬂux of an AR located ∼60(cid:48)(cid:48) west of the
emergence site.

(2) In six cases, ARs exhibit high magnetic helicity and en-
ergy budgets, but do not erupt. The computation of the decay
index for all ARs at the end times of the intervals used for the as-
sembly of the E-H diagram revealed that the six outlier ARs ac-
quire the critical decay index, nc = 1.5, at heights above 60 Mm,
whereas six out of seven eruptive ARs acquire it at heights below
60 Mm. Therefore it is possible that the six outlier ARs did not
erupt because the overlying magnetic ﬁeld provided stronger or
more extended conﬁnement than in eruptive ARs.

The ﬁrst statistical study of the magnetic helicity and energy
injection in emerging ARs was performed by Liu et al. (2014).
Our paper is the ﬁrst statistical study of the eruptive behavior
of emerging ARs in terms of their accumulated magnetic helic-
ity and energy. We found that in a statistical sense, the erupting
ARs possess larger budgets of both these quantities. A similar

result for ARs producing major ﬂares (M and X class) has been
reported by Tziotziou et al. (2012). The new ingredients of our
study compared to that of Tziotziou et al. (2012) are listed below.
(1) We employed a diﬀerent magnetic helicity and
energy calculation method (ﬂux-integration method versus
connectivity-based method).

(2) Our data base consisted exclusively of emerging ARs,
which are known to produce ﬂares during the ﬂux emergence
phase.

(3) Only in two ARs were the CMEs associated with M-class
ﬂares; in the remaining ﬁve ARs, the CMEs were associated with
C-class ﬂares.

We conclude that the ﬁnding that emerging ARs that erupt
statistically accumulate more magnetic helicity and energy than
noneruptive ARs is a robust result. This means that magnetic he-
licity and magnetic energy in any study of the eruptive potential
of these ARs should be treated equally.
