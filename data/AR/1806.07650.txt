RELATIONS FOR GROTHENDIECK GROUPS AND
REPRESENTATION-FINITENESS

HARUHISA ENOMOTO

Abstract. For an exact category E, we study the Butler’s condition “AR=Ex”: the relation
of the Grothendieck group of E is generated by Auslander-Reiten conﬂations. Under some
assumptions, we show that AR=Ex is equivalent to that E has ﬁnitely many indecomposables.
This can be applied to functorially ﬁnite torsion(free) classes and contravariantly ﬁnite resolving
subcategories of the module category of an artin algebra, and the category of Cohen-Macaulay
modules over an order which is Gorenstein or has ﬁnite global dimension. Also we showed that
under some weaker assumption, AR=Ex implies that the category of syzygies in E has ﬁnitely
many indecomposables.

1. Introduction
Let Λ be a ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebra over a ﬁeld k. To the abelian category mod Λ of ﬁnitely
generated Λ-modules, we can associate an abelian group K0(mod Λ) called the Grothendieck group.
This is the quotient group K0(mod Λ, 0)/ Ex(mod Λ), where K0(mod Λ, 0) denotes the free abelian
group with the basis the set of isomorphism classes [X] of indecomposable objects X ∈ mod Λ,
and Ex(mod Λ) the subgroup generated by [X] − [Y ] + [Z] for every exact sequence 0 → X → Y →
Z → 0.

Auslander-Reiten sequences, or AR sequences for short, are special kind of short exact sequences
in mod Λ, which are “minimal” in some sense. We denote by AR(mod Λ) the subgroup of Ex(mod Λ)
generated by AR sequences. Then Butler and Auslander proved the following result.
Theorem 1.1 ([But, Au3]). Let Λ be a ﬁnite-dimensional algebra. Then AR(mod Λ) = Ex(mod Λ)
holds if and only if there are only ﬁnitely many indecomposable objects in mod Λ up to isomorphism.

Auslander conjectured that similar results hold for a more general class of categories other than
mod Λ. In this paper, we study this conjecture in the context of Quillen’s exact categories. For a

H. ENOMOTO

Krull-Schmidt exact category E, the Grothendieck group K0(E) = K0(E, 0)/ Ex(E) of E is deﬁned
in the same way. Also the notion of AR sequences is deﬁned over E, which we call AR conﬂations.
Thus we have the subgroup AR(E) of Ex(E), and the aim of this paper is to study the following
question.

Question 1.2. For a Krull-Schmidt exact category E, when are the following equivalent?

(1) E is of ﬁnite type, that is, there exist only ﬁnitely many indecomposable objects in E up to

isomorphism.

(2) AR(E) = Ex(E) holds.

Let us mention some known results on this question. For the implication (1) ⇒ (2), we have

the following quite general result by the author:

Theorem 1.3 ([En2, Theorem 3.18], Corollary 4.4). Let R be a complete noetherian local ring
and E a Krull-Schmidt exact R-category such that E(X, Y ) is a ﬁnitely generated R-module for
each X, Y ∈ E. If E has enough projectives and is of ﬁnite type, then AR(E) = Ex(E) holds.

This can be applied to various situations in the representation theory of noetherian algebras.

We provide a proof of this in Corollary 4.4.

On the other hand, the implication (2) ⇒ (1) is more subtle. Indeed, some counter-examples
are known, e.g.
[MMP, Section 3]. However, there are aﬃrmative results for this implication
in some concrete situations: E = CM Λ for an R-order Λ with ﬁnite global dimension [AR1,
Proposition 2.3], and the category of modules with good ﬁltrations over standardly stratiﬁed
algebras [MMP, PR]. Also some partial results are known ([Hi, Ko]).

In this paper, we ﬁrst give a suﬃcient condition for (1) and (2) in Question 1.2 to be equivalent,
by using a functorial method. For a Krull-Schmidt exact category E, we consider the category
Mod E of functors E op → Ab. There is an important subcategory eﬀ E of Mod E, the category of
eﬀaceable functors (Deﬁnition 2.1), which nicely reﬂects the exact structure of E and is closely
related to the group Ex(E). Then let us consider the following conditions:

(a) E is of ﬁnite type.
(b) E is admissible [En2], that is, every object in eﬀ E has ﬁnite length in Mod E.
(c) AR(E) = Ex(E) holds.

Simple modules contained in eﬀ E bijectively correspond to AR conﬂations in E (Proposition 2.3).
Thus the condition (b) can be regarded as a functorial analogue of (c), hence it is somewhat closer
to (c) than (a) is. The relation of these conditions are summarized in Figure 1.1.

Secondly, we apply this condition to concrete situations and obtain results on Question 1.2. For
an artin algebra, we show the following result, which extends the results [MMP, Theorem 3] and
[PR, Theorem 3.6].

Theorem A (= Theorem 4.11). Let Λ be an artin algebra and E a contravariantly ﬁnite resolving
subcategory of mod Λ. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) E is of ﬁnite type.
(2) AR(E) = Ex(E) holds.

When R is not artinian, we prove the following result. This extends [Hi, Ko] to the non-
commutative case, and [AR1, Proposition 2.3] to Gorenstein orders. Also our method provides
another proof of [AR1, Proposition 2.3].

Theorem B (= Theorem 4.15, Corollary 5.3). Let R be a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring
and Λ an R-order with at most an isolated singularity. Suppose that Ex(CM Λ) = AR(CM Λ) holds.
Then the following hold.

(1) ΩCM Λ, the category of syzygies of Cohen-Macaulay Λ-modules, is of ﬁnite type.
(2) If Λ has ﬁnite global dimension or Λ is a Gorenstein order, then CM Λ is of ﬁnite type.

Actually, most of the results above are deduced from the following relations between (a), (b)

and (c):

projective generator over a commutative noetherian ring R. Then the implications in Figure 1.1

Figure 1.1. Summary of Section 3

Here we introduce the condition (CF) on exact categories concerning the Grothendieck groups

(see Deﬁnition 3.5).

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we introduce basic deﬁnitions and collect
some results about Grothendieck group and eﬀaceable functors. In Section 3, we introduce some
conditions on E and prove the relations indicated in Figure 1.1. In Section 4, we verify that the
conditions are satisﬁed in some concrete cases. In Section 5, we study the ﬁniteness of the category
of syzygies. In Appendix A, we provide some interesting properties of the category of eﬀaceable
functors.

1.1. Notation and conventions. Throughout this paper, we assume that all categories and
functors are additive and all subcategories are additive, full and closed under isomorphisms. For
an object G of an additive category E, we denote by add G the category consisting of all direct
summands of ﬁnite direct sums of G. We say that an additive category is of ﬁnite type if there
exists an object G ∈ E such that E = add G holds.

For a Krull-Schmidt category E, we denote by ind E the set of isomorphism classes of indecom-
posable objects in E. We refer the reader to [Kr] for the basics of Krull-Schmidt categories. We
say that an additive category E is an idempotent complete if every idempotent morphism splits.
It is well-known that a Krull-Schmidt category is idempotent complete.

As for exact categories, we use the terminologies inﬂations, deﬂations and conﬂations. We
refer the reader to [B¨u] for the basics of exact categories. We say that an exact category E has a
projective generator P if E has enough projectives add P .

2. Preliminaries

First we introduce the basic deﬁnition about Auslander-Reiten theory in a Krull-Schmidt cat-
egory. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt category and J its Jacobson radical. A morphism g : Y → Z in
E is called right almost split if Z is indecomposable, g is in J and any morphism h : W → Z in
J factors through g. Dually we deﬁne left almost split.

For a Krull-Schmidt exact category E, we say that a conﬂation 0 → X

g
−→ Z → 0 in E is an
AR conﬂation if f is left almost split and g is right almost split. We say that an indecomposable
object Z in E admits a right AR conﬂation if there exists an AR conﬂation ending at Z. We say
that E has right AR conﬂations if every indecomposable non-projective object admits a right AR
conﬂation. Left AR conﬂations are deﬁned dually, and we say that E has AR conﬂations if it has
both right and left AR conﬂations.

f
−→ Y

Next we introduce some notation concerning the Grothendieck group. For a Krull-Schmidt
exact category E, let K0(E, 0) be a free abelian group L[X]∈ind E Z · [X] generated by the set ind E
of isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects in E, which we identify with the Grothendieck
group of E with the split exact structure, that is, the exact structure where all conﬂations are split
exact. We denote by Ex(E) the subgroup of K0(E, 0) generated by

{[X] − [Y ] + [Z] | there exists a conﬂation X ֌ Y ։ Z in E}.

4

H. ENOMOTO

We call the quotient group K0(E) := K0(E, 0)/ Ex(E) the Grothendieck group of E. We denote by
AR(E) the subgroup of Ex(E) generated by

{[X] − [Y ] + [Z] | there exists an AR conﬂation X ֌ Y ։ Z in E}.

Throughout this paper, we make use of functor categorical arguments. Let us recall the related
concepts. For an additive category E, a right E-module M is a contravariant additive functor
M : E op → Ab from E to the category of abelian groups Ab. We denote by Mod E the category of
right E-modules, and morphisms are natural transformations between them. Then the category
Mod E is a Grothendieck abelian category with enough projectives, and projective objects are
precisely direct summands of (possibly inﬁnite) direct sums of representable functors.

We denote by mod E the category of ﬁnitely presented E-modules, that is, the modules M such
that there exists an exact sequence E(−, X) → E(−, Y ) → M → 0 for some X, Y in E. This
category mod E is not necessarily an abelian category, but mod E is closed under extensions in
Mod E by the horseshoe lemma. Thereby we always regard mod E as an exact category, which has
enough projectives in the sense of exact category. Moreover, if E is idempotent complete, then
projectives in mod E are precisely representable functors.

Now let us introduce the notion of eﬀaceability of E-modules, which plays an essential role

throughout this paper. This notion was originally introduced by Grothendieck [Gr, p. 141].

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let E be an exact category. A right E-module M is called eﬀaceable if there
exists a deﬂation f : Y ։ Z in E such that E(−, Y )
denote by eﬀ E the subcategory of mod E consisting of eﬀaceable functors.

E(−,f )
−−−−→ E(−, Z) → M → 0 is exact. We

The category eﬀ E plays a quite essential role to study exact categories in a functorial method.
This deﬁnition for exact categories is due to [Fi], and the category eﬀ E plays an important
role in [En2] to classify exact structures on a given additive category. For the compatibility of
Grothendieck’s eﬀaceability, see Proposition A.1.

In the rest of this section, we collect basic properties about functor categories and eﬀaceable

functors which we need in the sequel.

Proposition 2.2. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt category and J its Jacobson radical. Put SZ :=
E(−, Z)/J (−, Z) for Z ∈ E. Then the following hold.

(1) The map Z 7→ SZ gives a bijection between ind E and the set of isomorphism classes of

simple E-modules.

(2) A morphism g : Y → Z in E is right almost split if and only if Z is indecomposable and

E(−, Y )

E(−,g)
−−−−→ E(−, Z) → SZ → 0 is exact.

Proof. It is well-known, see [Au2] for example.

(cid:3)

In particular, simple E-modules contained in mod E bijectively correspond to indecomposable
objects in E which admit right almost split maps. Moreover if E is an exact category, then one
can show more on eﬀ E as follows.

Proposition 2.3. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt exact category and Z an indecomposable object in E.
Then the following are equivalent.

(1) Z admits a right AR conﬂation.
(2) SZ belongs to eﬀ E.
(3) SZ is ﬁnitely presented and Z is non-projective.

In particular, simple E-modules contained in eﬀ E bijectively correspond to indecomposables in E
which admit right AR conﬂations.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): We have a deﬂation g : Y ։ Z which is right almost split. Thus SZ ∼=
Coker E(−, g) belongs to eﬀ E.

(2) ⇒ (3): Since SZ is in eﬀ E, it is ﬁnitely presented. By [En2, Propositions 2.11], we have

that Z is non-projective since SZ(Z) 6= 0 holds.

(3) ⇒ (1): This is precisely [En2, Proposition A.3].

The following says that the category eﬀ E has nice properties and controls the exact structure
of E. Here we say that an E-module M is ﬁnitely generated if there exists a surjection from a
representable functor onto M .

Proposition 2.4. Let E be an idempotent complete exact category. Then the following holds.

(1) Suppose that there exists an exact sequence 0 → M1 → M → M2 → 0 in Mod E and that
M1 is ﬁnitely generated. Then M is in eﬀ E if and only if both M1 and M2 are in eﬀ E.
g
−→ Z in E is a conﬂation if and only if there exists an exact sequence

(2) A complex X

0 → E(−, X)
in Mod E with M in eﬀ E.

E(−,f )
−−−−→ E(−, Y )

E(−,g)
−−−−→ E(−, Z) → M → 0

Proof. We refer the reader to [En2, Proposition 2.10] for the proof of (1), and [En2, Theorem 2.7]
(cid:3)
or the proof of Lemma A.1 for (2).

The category eﬀ E enjoys further nice properties, e.g. being abelian, and we refer the interested

reader to Appendix A.

If E has enough projectives, then one has a simpler description of the category eﬀ E. Let E be
an exact category with enough projectives and denote by P the subcategory of E consisting of
projective objects. We deﬁne the stable category E by the ideal quotient E/[P]. Then eﬀ E can be
naturally identiﬁed with the module category of E, which we omit the proof.

Lemma 2.5 ([En2, Lemma 2.13]). Let E be an exact category with enough projectives P. Then
the natural restriction functor Mod E → Mod E induces an equivalence mod E ≃ eﬀ E.

3. General conditions for (a), (b) and (c) to be equivalent

In this section, we will provide some general results on the three conditions: (a) E is of ﬁnite
type, (b) E is admissible and (c) AR(E) = Ex(E). Here we say that E is admissible if every object
in eﬀ E has ﬁnite length in Mod E ([En2]). See Proposition A.3 for the equivalent condition of the
admissibility. Then our results in this section can be summarized in Figure 1.1 in the introduction.
To begin with, let us introduce some terminologies on R-categories needed in this paper. Let
R be a commutative noetherian ring and E an R-category. We say that an R-category E is
Hom-noetherian (resp. Hom-ﬁnite) if E(X, Y ) is ﬁnitely generated (resp. has ﬁnite length) as an
R-module for each X, Y in E.

To deal with admissibility, it is convenient to introduce the following criterion for deciding
whether the functor has ﬁnite length or not. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt category and M ∈ Mod E
a right E-module. Then the support supp M of M is deﬁned by

supp M := {X ∈ ind E | M (X) 6= 0}.

The Hom-ﬁniteness ensures that ﬁniteness of modules can be checked only by considering their
support:
Lemma 3.1. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt category and M ∈ mod E an E-module. If M has ﬁnite
length in Mod E, then supp M is a ﬁnite set. The converse holds if E is Hom-ﬁnite R-category.

Proof. See, for example, [Au2, Theorem 2.12].

(cid:3)

3.1. (a) Representation-ﬁniteness and (b) admissibility. First, we consider the relation
between: (a) E is of ﬁnite type, and (b) E is admissible.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let C be an additive category. We say that an object C ∈ C is a weak cogenerator
if C(X, C) = 0 implies that X is a zero object for every X ∈ C.

If we assume the existence of a weak cogenerator of the stable category, then (a) is almost

equivalent to (b).

Proposition 3.3. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt exact category with a projective generator. Consider
the following conditions:

6

H. ENOMOTO

(1) E is admissible and E has a weak cogenerator.
(2) E is of ﬁnite type.

Then (1) ⇒ (2) holds. The converse holds if E is a Hom-ﬁnite R-category for a commutative
noetherian ring R.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Since E has enough projectives, we may identify eﬀ E with mod E by Lemma 2.5.
Let X be a weak cogenerator of E. By the assumption, we have that E(−, X) has ﬁnite length.
This implies that supp E(−, X) is ﬁnite by Lemma 3.1. Since every indecomposable object W in
E should satisfy E(W , X) 6= 0, it follows that E is of ﬁnite type. Now E itself is of ﬁnite type
because we have a natural identiﬁcation ind E = ind E ⊔ ind(add P ).

(2) ⇒ (1): Suppose that E is of ﬁnite type and E is Hom-ﬁnite over R. Then obviously the
direct sum of all indecomposables in E is a weak cogenerator of E. Moreover, since E is Hom-ﬁnite
(cid:3)
and ind E is ﬁnite, every object in eﬀ E = mod E has ﬁnite length by Lemma 3.1.

3.2. (b) Admissibility and (c) AR=Ex. Now let us investigate the relation between the con-
dition (b) and (c). First we show that if (b) E is admissible, then (c) AR(E) = Ex(E) holds. Next
we will introduce the condition (CF) and show that the converse implication holds under it.

Proposition 3.4. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt exact category. Suppose that E is admissible. Then
Ex(E) = AR(E) holds.

Proof. This is proved in the similar way as [En2, Theorem 3.17]. We provide a proof here for the
convenience of the reader.

Let 0 → X1

g1
−→ Z1 → 0 be a conﬂation in E and we have to show [X1] − [Y1] + [Z1] ∈
AR(E). Put M := Coker E(−, g1) in Mod E, then M is in eﬀ E by the deﬁnition. Suppose that
g2
−→ Z2 → 0 in E such that M ∼= Coker E(−, g2).
there exists another conﬂation 0 → X2
Then we have exact sequences

f2
−→ Y2

f1
−→ Y1

0 → E(−, Xi)

E(−,fi)
−−−−−→ E(−, Yi)

E(−,gi)
−−−−−→ E(−, Zi) → M → 0

in Mod E for i = 1, 2. Thus Schanuel’s lemma shows that E(−, X1) ⊕ E(−, Y2) ⊕ E(−, Z1) ∼=
E(−, X2) ⊕ E(−, Y1) ⊕ E(−, Z2) in Mod E, hence X1 ⊕ Y2 ⊕ Z1 ∼= X2 ⊕ Y1 ⊕ Z2 in E by the Yoneda
lemma. This implies that [X1] − [Y1] + [Z1] = [X2] − [Y2] + [Z2] in K0(E, 0). Thus it suﬃces to
show the following claim.

Claim: For any M ∈ eﬀ E, there exists at least one exact sequence in Mod E

0 → E(−, X)

E(−,f )
−−−−→ E(−, Y )

E(−,g)
−−−−→ E(−, Z) → M → 0

with [X] − [Y ] + [Z] ∈ AR(E). Note that such a complex 0 → X → Y → Z → 0 is automatically
a conﬂation by Proposition 2.4(2).

We will show this claim by induction on l(M ), the length of M as an E-module. Suppose that
l(M ) = 1, that is, M is a simple E-module. We may assume that M = SZ for an indecomposable
g
−→ Z → 0 in E by
object Z ∈ E by Proposition 2.2, and there exists an AR conﬂation 0 → X
E(−,g)
−−−−→

f
−→ Y
E(−,f )
−−−−→ E(−, Y )

Proposition 2.3. This gives the desired projective resolution 0 → E(−, X)
E(−, Z) → SZ → 0 of SZ , and [X] − [Y ] + [Z] ∈ AR(E) holds.

Now suppose that l(M ) > 1. Take a simple E-submodule M1 of M . Then we have an exact
sequence 0 → M1 → M → M2 → 0 in Mod E. Since M1 is ﬁnitely generated, Proposition 2.4(1)
shows that M1 and M2 are both in eﬀ E. By induction hypothesis, we have an exact sequence
E(−,gi)
−−−−−→ E(−, Zi) → Mi → 0 with [Xi] − [Yi] + [Zi] ∈ AR(E) for
0 → E(−, Xi)
each i = 1, 2. By the horseshoe lemma, we obtain a projective resolution

E(−,fi)
−−−−−→ E(−, Yi)

0 → E(−, X1 ⊕ X2)

E(−,f )
−−−−→ E(−, Y1 ⊕ Y2)

E(−,g)
−−−−→ E(−, Z1 ⊕ Z2) → M → 0.

Then we have

[X1 ⊕ X2] − [Y1 ⊕ Y2] + [Z1 ⊕ Z2] = X
i=1,2

([Xi] − [Yi] + [Zi]) ∈ AR(E).

Thus the claim follows.

Next let us investigate when the converse of Proposition 3.4 holds. The author does not know
whether this always holds, but we show that this is the case for particular cases. To this purpose,
let us introduce the condition (CF), which stands for the Conservation of Finiteness.

Deﬁnition 3.5. For an exact category E, we say that E satisﬁes (CF) if it satisﬁes the following:

(CF) Let 0 → X

fi
−→ Y

gi
−→ Z → 0 be two conﬂations in E for i = 1, 2 and put Mi

:=

Coker E(−, gi) ∈ eﬀ E. If M1 has ﬁnite length in Mod E, then so does M2.

For later purposes, the following equivalent condition is more useful.

Lemma 3.6. For an exact category E, the condition (CF) is equivalent to the following condition.
(CF′) Let 0 → Xi

gi
−→ Zi → 0 be conﬂations in E for i = 1, 2 and put Mi := Coker E(−, gi)
in eﬀ E. Suppose that [X1] − [Y1] + [Z1] = [X2] − [Y2] + [Z2] holds in K0(E, 0). If M1 has
ﬁnite length in Mod E, then so does M2.

fi
−→ Yi

Proof. Obviously it suﬃces to show that (CF) implies (CF′). Since [X1] − [Y1] + [Z1] = [X2] −
[Y2] + [Z2] holds in K0(E, 0), we have that X2 ⊕ Y1 ⊕ Z2 ∼= X1 ⊕ Y2 ⊕ Z1 holds in E by the
Krull-Schmidtness of E. Now consider the following two complexes:

0 → X1 ⊕ X2

0 → X1 ⊕ X2

0 1
f1 0
0 0 (cid:21)

(cid:20)
−−−−−→ X2 ⊕ Y1 ⊕ Z2

1 0
0 f2
0 0 (cid:21)

0 g1 0
0 0 1 i

h
−−−−−−→ Z1 ⊕ Z2 → 0,

0 0 1
0 g2 0

h
−−−−−−→ Z1 ⊕ Z2 → 0.

i

These are conﬂations since they are direct sums of conﬂations and split exact sequences. Applying
(CF) to them, it is easy to check that (CF′) holds.
(cid:3)

Now we can state the following main result in this section.

Theorem 3.7. Let E be a Krull-Schmidt exact category. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) E is admissible.
(2) Ex(E) = AR(E) holds and E satisﬁes (CF).
(3) Ex(E) ⊗Z Q = AR(E) ⊗Z Q holds and E satisﬁes (CF).

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2):
Proposition 3.4, and the condition (CF) is trivially satisﬁed.

If every object in eﬀ E has ﬁnite length, then we have Ex(E) = AR(E) by

(2) ⇒ (3): Obvious.
g
(3) ⇒ (1): Let M be in eﬀ E and take a conﬂation 0 → X
−→ Z → 0 in E such that
E(−,g)
−−−−→ E(−, Z) → M → 0 is exact. By AR(E) ⊗Z Q = Ex(E) ⊗Z Q,
gi
−→ Zi → 0 for each

0 → E(−, X)
there exist a positive integer a, integer bi and an AR conﬂation 0 → Xi → Yi
i such that we have an equality in K0(E, 0):

E(−,f )
−−−−→ E(−, Y )

f
−→ Y

a([X] − [Y ] + [Z]) =

n

X
i=1

bi([Xi] − [Yi] + [Zi]).

We may assume that bi > 0 for i ≤ m and −ci := bi < 0 for i > m. Thus we have an equality

a([X] − [Y ] + [Z]) +

n

X
i=m+1

ci([Xi] − [Yi] + [Zi]) =

X
i=1

bi([Xi] − [Yi] + [Zi])

(3.1)

in K0(E, 0) such that all the coeﬃcients are positive integers. Thus each side of the equation (3.1)
comes from the single conﬂation in E. Put Si := Coker E(−, gi) ∈ mod E for each i, which is simple
E-module contained in eﬀ E. Then the left hand side in (3.1) corresponds to M a ⊕ L
in
in eﬀ E. Since the latter has ﬁnite length,
eﬀ E and the right hand side corresponds to L
the condition (CF′) implies that so does the former. Thus M has ﬁnite length.

4. Applications

In Section 3, we have shown the equivalence of (a), (b) and (c) under three technical assump-
tions: Hom-ﬁniteness of E, the existence of a weak cogenerator of E, and the condition (CF) (see
Figure 1.1 for a summary of these results). In this section, we show that these assumptions are
satisﬁed for some concrete cases.

Main applications we have in mind are the representation theory of noetherian algebras, where
the base ring is not necessarily artinian. For the convenience of the reader, we recall some related
deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let R be a noetherian local ring and Λ an R-algebra.

(1) Λ is called a noetherian R-algebra if Λ is ﬁnitely generated as an R-module. If in addition

R is artinian, then we say that Λ is an artin R-algebra.

(2) Suppose that R is Cohen-Macaulay. For a noetherian R-algebra, we denote by CM Λ
the category of ﬁnitely generated Λ-modules which are maximal Cohen-Macaulay as R-
modules.

(3) A noetherian R-algebra Λ is called an R-order if Λ ∈ CM Λ holds.
(4) We say that an R-order Λ has at most an isolated singularity if gl.dim Λp = ht p holds for

every non-maximal prime p ∈ Spec R.

(5) An R-order is called a Gorenstein order if CM Λ is a Frobenius exact category.
Let R be a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring and Λ an R-order. Then CM Λ is closed under
extensions in mod Λ, thus is an exact category with a projective generator Λ. Moreover, CM Λ has
AR conﬂations if and only if Λ has at most an isolated singularity [Au4].

4.1. Hom-ﬁniteness of the stable category. First we consider the Hom-ﬁniteness of E. Recall
that (a) ⇒ (b) holds if E is Hom-ﬁnite (Proposition 3.3). This condition is trivial if R is artinian,
hence we obtain the following.

Corollary 4.2. Let E be a Hom-ﬁnite idempotent complete exact R-category over a commutative
artinian ring R. Suppose that E is of ﬁnite type. Then E is admissible and AR(E) = Ex(E) holds.
For an artin algebra Λ, we can apply this result to any subcategory E of mod Λ which is closed

under extensions and direct summands.

If R is not artinian, we can use the following fact on Hom-ﬁniteness.

Lemma 4.3 ([En2, Proposition A.5]). Let R be a complete noetherian local ring and E a Hom-
noetherian idempotent complete exact R-category. Suppose that E has enough projectives and
consider the following conditions:

(1) E is of ﬁnite type.
(2) E has AR conﬂations.
(3) E is Hom-ﬁnite over R.

Then the implication (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3) holds.

Thus we immediately obtain the following.

Corollary 4.4 ([En2, Corollary 3.18]). Let R be a complete noetherian local ring and E a Hom-
noetherian idempotent complete exact R-category. Suppose that E has enough projectives and E is
of ﬁnite type. Then E is admissible and AR(E) = Ex(E) holds.

Note that the assumption on E here is rather mild. In particular, this corollary can be applied
to E := CM Λ for an R-order Λ which is CM-ﬁnite, that is, CM Λ is of ﬁnite type. Thus this
provides a further generalization of [Au3, Proposition 2.2].

4.2. Existence of a weak cogenerator of the stable category. For the implication (b) ⇒
(a), we need a weak cogenerator of E (Proposition 3.3). To this purpose, let us recall the notions
of functorially ﬁniteness and resolving subcategories.

Deﬁnition 4.5. Let A be an additive category and E an additive subcategory of A.

RELATIONS FOR GROTHENDIECK GROUPS AND REPRESENTATION-FINITENESS

(1) A morphism f : EX → X in A is said to be a right E-approximation if EX is in E and

every morphism E → X with E ∈ D factors through f .

(2) E is said to be contravariantly ﬁnite if every object in A has a right E-approximation.
A left E-approximation and covariantly ﬁniteness are deﬁned dually. We say that E is functorially
ﬁnite if it is both contravariantly and covariantly ﬁnite.
Deﬁnition 4.6. Let Λ be a noetherian ring and E a subcategory of mod Λ. We say that E is a
resolving subcategory of mod Λ if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

(1) E contains Λ.
(2) E is closed under extensions, that is, for each exact sequence 0 → X → Y → Z → 0, if

both X and Z are in E, then so is Y .

(3) E is closed under kernels of surjections, that is, for each exact sequence 0 → X → Y →

Z → 0, if both Y and Z are in E, then so is X.

(4) E is closed under summands.

Since each resolving subcategory is an extension-closed subcategory of an abelian category, it

has the natural exact structure. Thereby we always regard it as an exact category.

The following result provides a rich source of exact categories such that its stable category has

a weak cogenerator.

Proposition 4.7. Let Λ be a semiperfect noetherian ring and E a contravariantly ﬁnite resolv-
ing subcategory of mod Λ. Then E has a weak cogenerator, which can be chosen as a right E-
approximation of Λ/ rad Λ.
Proof. Since E is resolving in mod Λ, it is straightforward to see that E has a projective generator
Λ. Let us construct a weak cogenerator X of E (cf. [AR1, Lemma 2.4]). Since Λ is semiperfect,
Λ/ rad Λ is a direct sum of all simple Λ-modules up to multiplicity. Take a right E-approximation
f : X → Λ/ rad Λ of Λ/ rad Λ, and we claim that X is a weak cogenerator of E.

Suppose that E(W , X) = 0. Then it follows from this that every morphism from W to ﬁnitely
generated semisimple modules factors through some projective module. We will show that W is
projective, that is, W = 0 in E.

For a Jacobson radical rad W of W , let π : W ։ W/ rad W be a natural projection and take a
projective cover p : P ։ W/ rad W (this is possible since Λ is semiperfect). It follows that there
exists a projective cover ϕ : P ։ W such that the following diagram commutes:

P

ϕ

p

W

π

P

ψ

p

W/ rad W

Since W/ rad W is semisimple, π must factor through some projective module. Thus there exists
ψ : W → P which makes the above diagram commute. On the other hand, since p is right minimal,
(cid:3)
ψ ◦ ϕ must be an isomorphism. It follows that ϕ is an isomorphism, thus W is projective.

Now one immediately obtains the following result about the equivalence of (a) and (b) for a
contravariantly ﬁnite resolving subcategories over noetherian algebras. We will treat the case of
artin algebras later (see Theorem 4.11) since one can prove more.

Corollary 4.8. Let R be a complete noetherian local ring, Λ a noetherian R-algebra and E a
contravariantly ﬁnite resolving subcategory of mod Λ. Then E is of ﬁnite type if and only if E is
admissible.

Proof. There exists a weak cogenerator of E by Proposition 4.7 since Λ is semiperfect. Thus E is
of ﬁnite type if E is admissible by Proposition 3.3. The other implication follows from Corollary
(cid:3)
4.4.

Example 4.9. Let R be a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring and Λ an R-order. Then it is
well-known that CM Λ is a contravariantly ﬁnite resolving subcategory of mod Λ (e.g.
[AB]). In

10

H. ENOMOTO

particular, CM Λ has a weak cogenerator by Proposition 4.7 and Corollary 4.8 applies to CM Λ.
Thus Corollary 4.8 generalizes the result [Au3, Lemma 2.4 (b)] on the category CM Λ.

4.3. On the condition (CF). Recall that in Section 3.2, we have investigated the relation
between (b) admissibility and (c) AR=Ex, and Theorem 3.7 shows that the condition (CF) ensures
that (b) and (c) are equivalent. Now let us give some actual examples where E satisﬁes (CF). In
this subsection, we ﬁx a commutative noetherian ring R.

First we deal with exact categories which are Hom-ﬁnite.

Proposition 4.10. Let E be a Hom-ﬁnite exact R-category. Then E satisﬁes (CF).

fi
−→ Y

gi
Proof. Let 0 → X
−→ Z → 0 be conﬂations in E for i = 1, 2, and put Mi := Coker E(−, gi) ∈
eﬀ E. Then we have that [M1] = [E(−, X)] − [E(−, Y )] + [E(−, Z)] = [M2] holds in K0(mod E). We
will show that if M1 has ﬁnite length, then so does M2. It suﬃces to show that supp M2 is ﬁnite
by Lemma 3.1.

Let X be an indecomposable object in E. For each F in mod E, the assignment F 7→ lengthR F (X)
makes sense since E is Hom-ﬁnite. It clearly extends to the group homomorphism χX : K0(mod E) →
Z. Now we have that X ∈ supp M1 ⇔ χX [M1] 6= 0 ⇔ χX [M2] 6= 0 ⇔ X ∈ supp M2 by
(cid:3)
[M1] = [M2]. Thus supp M1 = supp M2 holds, and this is ﬁnite since M1 has ﬁnite length.

Now we immediately obtain the following general result on artin algebras.

Theorem 4.11. Let Λ be an artin algebra and E a contravariantly ﬁnite resolving subcategory of
mod Λ. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) E is of ﬁnite type.
(2) E is admissible.
(3) AR(E) = Ex(E) holds.
(4) AR(E) ⊗Z Q = Ex(E) ⊗Z Q holds.

Proof. Since Λ is artin algebra, Λ is semiperfect and E is Hom-ﬁnite. Thus Propositions 3.3 and
4.7 imply that (1) and (2) are equivalent. Furthermore, since E is Hom-ﬁnite, E satisﬁes (CF) by
(cid:3)
Proposition 4.10. Thus the other conditions are also equivalent by Theorem 3.7.

Contravariantly ﬁnite resolving subcategories are closely related to so called cotilting modules

by the famous result of [AR2]. For the convenience of the reader, we explain their result here.
Deﬁnition 4.12. Let Λ be an artin algebra and U a Λ-module in mod Λ. Then U is called a
cotilting Λ-module if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

Λ (U, U ) = 0 holds.

(1) the injective dimension of U is ﬁnite.
(2) Ext>0
(3) There exists an exact sequence 0 → Un → · · · → U0 → DΛ → 0 of Λ-modules with
Ui ∈ add U for each i, where D denotes the standard duality D : mod Λop → mod Λ.
For a module U in mod Λ, we denote by ⊥U the full subcategory of mod Λ consisting of modules

X satisfying Ext>0
Proposition 4.13 ([AR2, Theorem 5.5]). Let Λ be an artin algebra and U a cotilting Λ-module.
Then ⊥U is a contravariantly ﬁnite resolving subcategory of mod Λ.

Λ (X, U ) = 0.

Thus we can apply Theorem 4.11 to E := ⊥U for a cotilting module U over an artin algebra.

This provides a rich source of examples:

• Let E be a functorially ﬁnite torsionfree class of mod Λ for an artin algebra Λ (see [ASS]).
Then by factoring out the annihilator of E, we may assume that E is a faithful functorially
ﬁnite torsionfree class. It is well-known that such E is of the form ⊥U for a cotilting Λ-
module with id U ≤ 1 (see e.g. [Sm, Theorem]), so Theorem 4.11 applies to E. By duality,
every functorially ﬁnite torsion class over artin algebras is also an example.

• An artin algebra Λ is called Iwanaga-Gorenstein if both id(ΛΛ) and id(ΛΛ) are ﬁnite. In
this case, we write GP Λ := ⊥Λ and call it the category of Gorenstein-projective modules.
It is immediate that Λ itself is a cotilting Λ-module, so we can apply Theorem 4.11 to
E := GP Λ.

Next we will consider the case dim R > 0. Although E is rarely Hom-ﬁnite, we can conclude
(CF) by using the Hom-ﬁniteness of the stable category E in some cases. Let us introduce some
terminologies to state our result.

Let E be an exact category with enough projectives. In this case, we have the syzygy functor
Ω : E → E. We denote by X in E for the image of X in E under the natural projection E ։ E.
For an object X in E, we say that X has ﬁnite projective dimension if there exists some integer
n ≥ 0 such that ΩnX = 0 holds in E.

Recall that an exact category E is called Frobenius if E has enough projectives and enough

injectives, and the classes of projectives and injectives coincide.

Proposition 4.14. Let R be a complete noetherian local ring and E a Hom-noetherian idempotent
complete exact R-category with AR conﬂations. Suppose that E satisﬁes either one of the following
conditions:

(1) E has enough projectives and every object in E has ﬁnite projective dimension, or
(2) E is Frobenius.
Then E satisﬁes (CF).

fi
−→ Y

gi
Proof. Let 0 → X
−→ Z → 0 be conﬂations in E for i = 1, 2. Put Mi := Coker E(−, gi) ∈
eﬀ E for each i and suppose that M1 has ﬁnite length. We will show that so does M2. First note
that Lemma 2.5 applies to this situation since E has enough projectives, so we identify eﬀ E with
mod E naturally. Then Mi has ﬁnite length as an E-module if and only if it does so as an E-module.
Moreover, since E is Hom-ﬁnite by Lemma 4.3, this occurs if and only if supp Mi is ﬁnite, where
the support is considered inside ind E.

(1) First we prove that [M1] = [M2] holds in K0(mod E). Choose an integer n ≥ 0 such that

ΩnZ = 0 holds in E. Then it is classical that we have an exact sequence in mod E for each i:

0 → E(−, Ωn−1X) → E(−, Ωn−1Y ) → E(−, Ωn−1Z) → · · ·

→ E(−, ΩX) → E(−, ΩY ) → E(−, ΩZ) → E(−, X) → E(−, Y ) → E(−, Z) → Mi → 0.

Therefore it immediately follows that [M1] = [M2] holds in K0(mod E).

Let X be an indecomposable object of E. Since E is a Hom-ﬁnite R-category by Lemma 4.3, we
have the characteristic map χX : K0(mod E) → Z which sends F to lengthR F (X). Then we have
X ∈ supp M1 ⇔ χX [M1] 6= 0 ⇔ χX [M2] 6= 0 ⇔ X ∈ supp M2, where the support is considered
inside ind E. Thus Proposition 3.1 implies that M2 has ﬁnite length.

(2) Put Ni := Ker E(−, fi) for each i = 1, 2. Then we have exact sequences in mod E as in (1):

0 → Ni → E(−, X)

E(−,fi)
−−−−−→ E(−, Y )

E(−, ΩY )

E(−,gi)
−−−−−→ E(−, Z) → Mi → 0,
E(−,Ωgi)
−−−−−−→ E(−, ΩZ) → Ni → 0.

It follows from the ﬁrst exact sequence that [M1 ⊕ N1] = [M1] + [N1] = [M2] + [N2] = [M2 ⊕ N2]
holds in K0(mod E). We will show that N1 has ﬁnite length. By the same argument as in (1), we
have that supp(M1 ⊕ N1) = supp(M2 ⊕ N2) holds in ind E. Now Ω : E → E is an equivalence since
E is Frobenius, and let us denote by Ω− : E → E the quasi-inverse of Ω. Then it is easily checked
that X ∈ supp N1 ⇔ Ω−X ∈ supp M1 ⇔ X ∈ Ω(supp M1) holds for an indecomposable object
X ∈ E, hence supp N1 = Ω(supp M1). Therefore supp N1 is ﬁnite, and so is supp(M1 ⊕ N1) =
(cid:3)
supp(M2 ⊕ N2). Hence supp M2 is ﬁnite, which implies that M2 has ﬁnite length.

For an R-order Λ with at most an isolated singularity, Proposition 4.14 shows that CM Λ
satisﬁes (CF) if either Λ has ﬁnite global dimension or Λ is a Gorenstein order. Thus we obtain
the following result on the category CM Λ.

Theorem 4.15. Let R be a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring and Λ an R-order with at most
an isolated singularity. Put E := CM Λ. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) E is of ﬁnite type.
(2) E is admissible.

12

H. ENOMOTO

Assume in addition that either Λ has ﬁnite global dimension or Λ is a Gorenstein order. Then the
following are also equivalent.
(3) AR(E) = Ex(E) holds.
(4) AR(E) ⊗Z Q = Ex(E) ⊗Z Q holds.

Proof. This follows from Example 4.9 and Proposition 4.14.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.16. Theorem 4.15 for the case Λ has ﬁnite global dimension was shown in [AR1,
Proposition 2.3], but their proof relies on higher algebraic K-theory. Also Theorem 4.15 generalizes
[Hi] where Λ is assumed to be commutative and Gorenstein. The author does not know whether
all the conditions above are equivalent without any assumption on an R-order Λ, even if Λ is
commutative.

5. Finiteness of syzygies
Let R be a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring and suppose that AR(CM R) = Ex(CM R) holds.
Although we do not know whether CM R is of ﬁnite type, it is shown in [Ko] that ΩCM R, the
category of syzygies of CM R is so. In this section, we will extend this result to a non-commutative
order.

Let E be an exact category with enough projectives.

In this section, we denote by ΩE the
subcategory of E consisting of objects X such that there exists an inﬂation X ֌ P in E for some
projective object P . If E is Krull-Schmidt, then so is ΩE since ΩE is closed under direct sums and
summands. The essential image of ΩE under the natural projection E ։ E coincides with ΩE, the
essential image of the syzygy functor Ω : E → E. We begin with the following property about ΩE,
which is of interest in itself.

Lemma 5.1. Let R be a commutative noetherian ring, and let E be a Hom-noetherian idempotent
complete exact R-category with a projective generator P . Then the syzygy functor Ω : E → ΩE has
a fully faithful left adjoint Ω− : ΩE → E.

Proof. For each object W ∈ ΩE, take a left (add P )-approximation f : W → P W (this is possible
since E is Hom-noetherian). Since W is in ΩE, there exists an inﬂation f ′
: W ֌ P ′ with
P ′ ∈ add P . Thus f ′ factors through f , which implies that f is an inﬂation by the idempotent
completeness of E ([B¨u, Proposition 7.6]). Now we deﬁne Ω−W ∈ E by the following conﬂation:

0 → W

f

−→ P W g

−→ Ω−W → 0.

Next suppose that we have a map ϕ : W1 → W2 in ΩE. This induces the commutative diagram

in E where both rows are conﬂations, since f2 ◦ ϕ must factor through f1. A simple diagram chase
shows that this deﬁnes a well-deﬁned isomorphism Ω− : E(W1, W2) → E(Ω−W1, Ω−W2), with its
inverse induced by the syzygy functor Ω : E → ΩE. Thus we obtain a functor Ω− : ΩE → E, which
is fully faithful and satisﬁes ΩΩ− ∼= idΩE .

Finally we show that Ω− : ΩE → E is a left adjoint of Ω : E → ΩE. Let W be in ΩE and X in
E. Then the syzygy functor induces a morphism E(Ω−W, X) → E(W, ΩX) by ΩΩ−W ∼= W in E.
It is easy to show that this map is bijective, by considering the following diagram

Theorem 5.2. Let R be a complete noetherian local ring and E a Hom-noetherian idempo-
tent complete exact R-category with a projective generator P and AR conﬂations. Suppose that
AR(E) ⊗Z Q = Ex(E) ⊗Z Q holds. Then the following holds.

(1) For every object M in eﬀ E, we have that supp M ∩ ind(ΩE) is ﬁnite, where the support is

considered inside ind E.

(2) Assume in addition that E has a weak cogenerator. Then ΩE is of ﬁnite type.

Proof. Throughout this proof, supports of functors are always considered inside ind E.

(1) First recall that the stable category E is Hom-ﬁnite over R by Lemma 4.3. By the similar

argument as in Proposition 3.7, it suﬃces to prove the following weaker version of (CF).

(CF)Ω Let 0 → X

fi
−→ Y

gi
−→ Z → 0 be conﬂations in E for i = 1, 2 and put Mi := Coker E(−, gi) ∈

eﬀ E. If supp M1 is ﬁnite, then supp M2 ∩ ind(ΩE) is ﬁnite.

Assume the above situation and put Ni := Ker E(−, fi) for each i = 1, 2. Then we have exact
sequences in mod E for i = 1, 2, as in the proof of Proposition 4.14(2):

0 → Ni → E(−, X)

E(−,fi)
−−−−−→ E(−, Y )

E(−, ΩY )

E(−,gi)
−−−−−→ E(−, Z) → Mi → 0,
E(−,Ωgi)
−−−−−−→ E(−, ΩZ) → Ni → 0.

As in the proof of Proposition 4.14(2), it is enough to show that supp N1 ∩ ind(ΩE) is ﬁnite.
Actually we will show that every element of supp N1 ∩ ind(ΩE) is isomorphic to ΩA for some
A ∈ supp M1, which obviously implies the desired claim.

Let W be an element of supp N1 ∩ ind(ΩE), so E(W , Ωg1) : E(W , ΩY1) → E(W , ΩZ1) is not
surjective. By Lemma 5.1, this is equivalent to that E(Ω−W , g1) : E(Ω−W , Y1) → E(Ω−W , Z1) is
not surjective. On the other hand, since Ω− : ΩE → E is fully faithful by Lemma 5.1, we have that
Ω−W is indecomposable. Thus Ω−W belongs to supp M1. Now W ∼= ΩΩ−W in E holds, which
completes the proof.

(2) Let X be a weak cogenerator of E. By (1), we have that that ind(ΩE) ∩ supp E(−, X) is
ﬁnite. Since every indecomposable object W in E should satisfy E(W , X) 6= 0, it follows that
ΩE is of ﬁnite type. Now ΩE itself is of ﬁnite type because we have a natural identiﬁcation
(cid:3)
ind(ΩE) = ind(ΩE) ⊔ ind(add P ).

Now we apply this theorem to the category of Cohen-Macaulay modules. The obtained result

extends [Hi, Ko], where Λ was assumed to be commutative.

Corollary 5.3. Let R be a complete Cohen-Macaulay local ring and Λ an R-order with at most
an isolated singularity. If AR(CM Λ) ⊗Z Q = Ex(CM Λ) ⊗Z Q holds, then ΩCM Λ is of ﬁnite type.

Proof. We can apply Theorem 5.2 to E := CM Λ since E has a weak cogenerator by Example
(cid:3)
4.9.

Appendix A. Some properties of the category of effaceable functors

First we show that our notion of eﬀaceability is equivalent to that of Grothendieck (see [Gr, p.

148] or [We, Exercise 2.4.5] for the standard deﬁnition).

Proposition A.1. Let E be an idempotent complete exact category and M ∈ Mod E a right E-
module. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) M is in eﬀ E.
(2) M is ﬁnitely presented, and for every W ∈ E and w ∈ M (W ), there exists a deﬂation

ψ : E ։ W in E such that (M ψ)(w) = 0.

g
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Suppose that M is in eﬀ E and take a conﬂation 0 → X → Y
−→ Z → 0 in E
such that M ∼= Coker E(−, g). Denote by π : E(−, Z) ։ M the natural projection. Clearly M
is ﬁnitely presented. Let W ∈ E and w ∈ M (W ). By the Yoneda lemma, we have a morphism

14

H. ENOMOTO

w∗ : E(−, W ) → M . By the projectivity of E(−, W ) and the Yoneda lemma, we have a map
ϕ : W → Z such that π ◦ E(−, ϕ) = w∗. Now let us take the pullback of g along ϕ:

0

0

X

X

ψ

g

E

Y

W

ϕ

Z

Note that ψ is a deﬂation. This yields the following commutative diagram in Mod E:

E(−,ψ)

E(−, E)

E(−, W )

E(−,ϕ)

w∗

0

E(−, X)

E(−, Y )

E(−,g)

E(−, Z)

M

π

0

By applying these functors to E, it is straightforward to check that (M ψ)(w) = 0.

(2) ⇒ (1): Suppose that M satisﬁes the condition of (2). Since M is ﬁnitely presented, we
have a morphism g : Y → Z in E such that E(−, Y ) → E(−, Z) → M → 0 is exact. We have an
element z ∈ M (Z) which corresponds to E(−, Z) → M by the Yoneda lemma. By the assumption,
there exists a deﬂation ψ : E ։ Z such that (M ψ)(z) = 0. The Yoneda lemma implies that the
composition E(−, E) → E(−, Z) → M is a zero map, hence the map E(−, ψ) lifts to E(−, Y ). Thus
we have a map h : E → Y such that g ◦ h = ψ. Since ψ is a deﬂation, we can conclude that so is
(cid:3)
g by the idempotent completeness of E. Therefore M is in eﬀ E.

Next we prove that eﬀ E is an abelian subcategory of Mod E.

Theorem A.2. Let E be an exact category. Then eﬀ E is closed under kernels and cokernels in
Mod E. In particular, eﬀ E is an abelian category such that the inclusion eﬀ E → Mod E is exact.
Moreover, eﬀ E is closed under extensions in Mod E.

Proof. Let ϕ : M1 → M2 be a morphism in eﬀ E. For each i = 1, 2, we have the corresponding
gi
−→ Zi → 0 in E satisfying Mi = Coker E(−, gi). We will show that
conﬂations 0 → Xi
the image, kernel and cokernel of ϕ in Mod E are contained in eﬀ E. Sine ϕ induces a morphism
between the projective resolutions of M1 and M2, we have the following commutative diagram in
E by the Yoneda lemma:

By the Yoneda embedding, we obtain the following commutative diagram in Mod E correspond-

ing to (A.1), where all the rows are exact.

We have that K, M and N belong to eﬀ E. We can check that ϕ1 is surjective and ϕ2 is injective,
hence M is a image of ϕ. Moreover, one can show that ι is a kernel of ϕ1 (or equivalently, ϕ) and
π is a cokernel of ϕ2 (or equivalently ϕ). We leave the details to the reader.

For the extension-closedness of eﬀ E, we refer the reader to [En2, Proposition 2.10].

In this paper, we often deal with the ﬁniteness of length of eﬀaceable E-modules. Since eﬀ E
and Mod E are both abelian, the length of eﬀaceable modules seems to depend on the ambient
category we adopt. This is not the case by the following.

Proposition A.3. Let E be an exact category and M an object in eﬀ E.
(1) M has ﬁnite length in eﬀ E if and only if it does so in Mod E.
(2) Suppose that mod E is abelian. Then M has ﬁnite length in Mod E if and only if it does so

in mod E.

Moreover, the length and the composition factors of M in Mod E coincide with those in eﬀ E and
in mod E.

This follows from the following elementary observation.

Lemma A.4. Let E be an additive category and A an abelian subcategory of Mod E such that
the inclusion A → Mod E is exact. Suppose that A is closed under ﬁnitely generated submodules.
Then the following are equivalent for every object M in A.

(1) M has ﬁnite length in Mod E.
(2) M has ﬁnite length in A.

Moreover, the length and the composition factors of M in Mod E coincides with those in A.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): This is clear since the lattice of subobjects of M in A is a subposet of that in
Mod E.

(2) ⇒ (1): It suﬃces to show that every simple object in A is also simple in Mod E. Let M be
a simple object in A and N a non-zero submodule of M in Mod E. By using the Yoneda lemma, it
is easily checked that there is a non-zero ﬁnitely generated submodule N ′ of N in Mod E. Since N ′
is a ﬁnitely generated submodule of M , we have that N ′ belongs to A by the assumption. Thus
N ′ = M holds by N ′ ≤ M in A and N ′ 6= 0.

The remaining assertions are clear from the above proof and the Jordan-H¨older theorem. (cid:3)

Proof of Proposition A.3. (1) The category eﬀ E satisﬁes the conditions in Lemma A.4 by Propo-
sitions A.2 and 2.4(1).

(2) Suppose that mod E is abelian. Then it is well-known that the embedding mod E → Mod E
is exact and that mod E is closed under ﬁnitely generated submodules, see [Au1]. Thus Lemma
(cid:3)
A.4 applies.
