Background: 40K plays a signiﬁcant role in the radiogenic heating of earth-like exoplanets, which
can aﬀect the development of a habitable environment on their surfaces. The initial amount of 40K
in the interior of these planets depends on the composition of the interstellar clouds from which
they formed. Within this context, nuclear reactions that regulate the production of 40K during
stellar evolution can play a critical role. Purpose: In this study, we constrain for the ﬁrst time the
astrophysical reaction rate of 40K(n,p)40Ar, which is responsible for the destruction of 40K during
stellar nucleosynthesis. We provide to the nuclear physics community high-resolution data on the
cross-section and angular distribution of the 40Ar(p,n)40K reaction. These are important to various
applications involving 40Ar. The associated reaction rate of the 40Ar(p,n)40K process addresses
a reaction rate gap in the JINA REACLIB database in the region of intermediate-mass isotopes
Methods: We performed diﬀerential cross-section measurements on the 40Ar(p,n)40K reaction, for
six energies in the center-of-mass between 3.2 and 4.0 MeV and various angles between 0◦ and 135◦.
The experiment took place at the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory at Ohio University using the
beam swinger target location and a standard neutron time-of-ﬂight technique. We extracted total
and partial cross-sections by integrating the double diﬀerential cross-sections we measured. Re-
sults: The total and partial cross-sections varied with energy due to the contribution from isobaric
analog states and Ericson type ﬂuctuations. The energy-averaged neutron angular distributions
were symmetrical relative to 90 ◦. Based on the experimental data, local transmission coeﬃcients
were extracted and were used to calculate the astrophysical reaction rates of 40Ar(p,n)40K and
40K(n,p)40Ar reactions. The new rates were found to vary signiﬁcantly from the theoretical rates
in the REACLIB library. We implemented the new rates in network calculations to study nucle-
osynthesis via the slow neutron capture process, and we found that the produced abundance of 40K
is reduced by up to 10% compared to calculations with the library rates. At the same time, the
above result removes a signiﬁcant portion of the previous theoretical uncertainty on the 40K yields
from stellar evolution calculations. Conclusions: Our results support that the destruction rate of
40K in massive stars via the 40K(n,p)40Ar reaction is larger compared to previous estimates. The
rate of 40K destruction via the 40K(n,p)40Ar reaction now has a dramatically reduced uncertainty
based on our measurement. This result directly aﬀects the predicted stellar yields of 40K from
nucleosynthesis, which is a critical input parameter for the galactic chemical evolution models that
are currently employed for the study of signiﬁcant properties of exoplanets.

I.

INTRODUCTION

40K is a very long-lived naturally occurring radioiso-
tope of potassium. The slow beta decay rate that trans-
forms it into 40Ar gives it important roles beyond that of
the enrichment of the interstellar medium. One such role
is in the area of nucleocosmochronology [1]. A possibly
more exciting role, however, is related to the evolution
of habitable environments in earth-like extrasolar plan-
ets. 40K is typically found in the interiors of exoplanets,
a remnant of the nucleosynthesis events that enriched
the interstellar gas cloud and, in turn, gave birth to the

∗ gasti1p@cmich.edu
† perdi1g@cmich.edu

main-sequence star that such exoplanets typically orbit.
The decay of 40K is an exothermic process that generates
heat. It is hence found among other radioactive elements
responsible for keeping an Earth-like planet’s mantle hot
for the billions of years following its birth. This so-called
radiogenic heating and its evolution since a planet’s for-
mation are critically connected to the initiation and sus-
tainability of any tectonic activity of the earth-like planet
as well as of other planetary functions that control CO2
levels in a planet’s atmosphere. Processes that aﬀect the
emission and absorption of greenhouse gases on a planet
control the balance of heat and inﬂuence habitability [2].
It has been shown that it is the initial composition of
a planet in long-lived radioactive elements and particu-
larly the quantities upon the formation of 40K and 235U
that are critical parameters in the evolution towards a

and supernovae neutrinos for experiments relevant to
neutrino physics and astrophysics. 40Ar has used in ac-
celerator physics technological applications. Such uses
of 40Ar include its placement in stripping gas-targets in
tandem accelerators [9], and in testing stable beams in
low- and high-energy linear accelerator facilities such as
ReA3 at the Facility of Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) and
Linac3 at CERN.

In the context of the last two applications, studies on
proton and neutron-induced reactions on 40Ar at MeV-
scale energies, are useful in the development of diagnos-
tics tools, for testing experimental setups [10], and for
background characterization [11] in long-baseline exper-
iments. Currently, the only available experimental data
for the 40Ar(p,n)40K reaction at energies below 20 MeV,
come from low energy neutron yield measurements for
the determination of reaction thresholds, Q-values, and
Isobaric Analog States [12–15]. The energy resolution of
some of these earlier works is comparable to the data pre-
sented here, but the absolute quantiﬁcation of the cross-
section was not a primary goal of the authors. The work
of Young et al. [15] deserves particular mention, since
it included an attempt at the measurement of the total
cross-section using a long counter. While a plot of the
excitation function was given, the authors acknowledged
the non-quantiﬁed systematic uncertainty in the energy
dependence of their neutron detector’s eﬃciency and did
not tabulate the cross-section. Presumably, the unknown
energy dependence of the eﬃciency is the reason that the
work of Young et al. is not included in any database of
cross-section data for the (p,n) reaction.

In this work, we present for the ﬁrst time a complete set
of high-resolution experimental data on the 40Ar(p,n)40K
reaction excitation function and its angular distribution.
We extract the absolute total cross-section, as well as
partial cross-sections of the 40Ar(p,nx)40K, (x=0,1,2) re-
actions to the ground and two ﬁrst levels of excitation
of 40K. We compare the cross-sections and the angu-
lar distributions with the theory and ﬁnd that the re-
sults are consistent with the predictions of the statistical
model.
In particular, we explain the details of the ex-
citation function in the context of the phenomenon of
isobaric analog states and Ericson-type ﬂuctuation the-
ory, which are applicable in our case. We use the experi-
mental data to extract local values for the proton - 40Ar
transmission coeﬃcients. From the experimental cross-
section data, we calculate the experimentally constrained
astrophysical reaction rate for the 40Ar(p,n)40K reaction.
Using detailed balance, we extract the reaction rate for
the destruction of 40K via the 40K(n,p)40Ar and ﬁnd it
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the recommended library rate
that is based on theory. Finally, by implementing the ex-
tracted rates in network calculations, we study s-process
nucleosynthesis and ﬁnd that the produced abundance
of 40K is ∼10% lower compared to calculations with the
REACLIB rates.

We have divided the article into four sections. In Sec-
tion II, we describe the experimental setup that we used

of 40K are through the (n, p) and (n, α) reaction rates (solid

habitable environment [2, 3].

In massive stars, 40Ar and 40K are mainly created
through neutron capture reactions. The abundances of
the two isotopes are connected since they share a common
reaction ﬂow during helium, carbon, and neon burning.
Nucleosynthesis calculations have shown that the abun-
dances of the two isotopes are mutually sensitive to the
reaction rates responsible for their destruction [4]. For
40K these rates are the 40K(n,α)37Cl and 40K(n,p)40Ar
reactions. An example of a reaction ﬂow involving these
rates in the context of a simple model of weak s-process

back to 40K via the 40Ar(p,n)40K reaction, a process that
needs, however, temperatures of the order of 5 GK to
switch on.

A search in the JINA REACLIB library [5] –we used
REACLIB v2.2– commonly used for astrophysics ap-
plications reveals a shocking lack of experimental data
on (p,n) and (n,p) reactions for intermediate-mass nu-
clei with atomic numbers between Z=14 and Z=33 and
30<A<70. The only available experimental data in
the library are those for 41K(p,n)41Ca and its time-
inverse rate for 41Ca(n,p)41K. A detailed study of the
40Ar(p,n)40K reaction at energies into -or close to- the
Gamow window allows to set constraints on both the di-
rect and the inverse astrophysical reaction rates and to
improve the accuracy of relevant abundance predictions
for the astrophysics applications mentioned above.

40Ar is an increasingly more valuable gas used in var-
ious scientiﬁc ﬁelds. In the last two decades, 40Ar has
found extended use in neutrino physics experiments due
to its low cost, non-reactive nature, and relatively easy
puriﬁcation process. Puriﬁed 40Ar, is used in Liquid Ar-
gon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) which are
integrated in neutrino tracking detector systems such as
MicroBooNE [6], ICARUS [7], and LArIAT [8]. These
systems are optimized for detecting accelerator, solar,

for the measurement of diﬀerential cross sections and an-
gular distributions at Ohio University. In Section III, we
discuss the details of the data analysis and the extraction
of neutron eﬃciencies, while in Section IV, we summarize
the results and compare them with the statistical model
calculations. In addition, we discuss the implications of
this study in s-process nucleosynthesis and show results
from network calculations. The conclusions of our work
are summarized in Section V.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experiment was carried out at the 4.5 MV tandem
accelerator of the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory using
the beam swinger capability of the facility [16]. Pulsed
proton beams at energies between 3.5 and 4.2 MeV were
delivered from the tandem accelerator into a cylindri-
cal gas-cell target at the end of the swinger magnet,
as shown in Fig 2. The cylindrical body of the gas-
cell was 3 cm in length and had a 9 mm internal di-
ameter. A set of beam collimators upstream of the
gas-cell provided a beam spot of ∼4 mm in diameter
at the target position, while a 1 mm-thick gold layer
at the bottom of the cylinder served as a beam stop-
per. To keep the beam-induced neutron background as
low as possible, the entrance window of the gas-cell was
made out of high purity (∼99.5%) aluminum and was
10.37±0.04 µm-thick. The thickness and composition of
the aluminum foil were determined via Rutherford back-
scattering spectroscopy (RBS) and proton-induced x-ray
emission (PIXE) analysis at Ohio University. During the
data taking phase of the experiment, the gas-cell was
ﬁlled with natural argon gas (99.999%) and was pres-
surized at 198±5 Torr. This pressure corresponded to
an areal density of (1.97±0.01)·1019 atoms/cm2 for 40Ar,
while the purity of the gas was veriﬁed with a residual
gas analyzer (RGA) at the end of the experiment. Lower
(98 Torr) and higher (414 Torr) pressures than the one for
data taking were also used to understand the qualitative
features of the cross-section and its ﬂuctuating character.
The use of various pressures and, consequently, target
thicknesses allowed us to interpret the neutron spectra
in terms of the interplay between energy resolution of
the experiment and ﬂuctuations in the cross-section.

For the detection of neutrons, we used a plastic scintil-
lator detector that is similar to the Low Energy Neutron
Detector Array (LENDA) bars [17]. The size of the de-
tector’s crystal was 31×4.5×2.5 cm3 (Length × Height
× Width), which is 1 cm longer compared to a stan-
dard LENDA bar. We placed the bar inside the neutron
time-of-ﬂight tunnel at a distance of 5 m from the gas
target. The swinger magnet, which can rotate around
the center of the target at angles between 0 ◦ ≤ θlab (cid:46)
180 ◦, deﬁned the angle θlab of the detector relative to
the beam axis. During the experiment, the neutron de-
tector was oriented horizontally relative to the ground
(see Fig 2). Having the crystal in this position, we were

time-of-ﬂight tunnel at the Edwards Accelerator Laboratory
(modiﬁed image from [16]). The beam swinger allows the
beam axis to rotate around the target center, making pos-
sible measurements of neutron yields at various reaction an-
gles without the need for multiple neutron ﬂight paths. The
swinger is part of the 4.5 MV Tandem accelerator of Ohio
University.

able to achieve an angular resolution of 0.25 ◦ in θlab. The
uncertainty in timing due to the crystal’s length was less
than 0.5 ns. The intrinsic timing resolution of LENDA
is also less than 0.5 ns [17]. Therefore, the pulsing and
bunching of the beam dominated the timing uncertainty,
which we measured using the neutron spectra to be no
more than 2 ns.

For determining the neutron angular distributions, we
performed measurements at various angles between 0 ◦
and 135 ◦. While the swinger magnet can rotate up to
180 ◦, the system’s supporting materials upstream of the
gas-cell signiﬁcantly shadowed the target for θlab > 135 ◦.
For this reason, we did not use in this study any mea-
surements at larger angles than 135 ◦.

To determine the intrinsic eﬃciency of LENDA at the
neutron energies of the experiment, we performed an ef-
ﬁciency calibration measurement using the neutron spec-
trum of the 9Be(d,n) reaction for a thick Be-target. The
9Be(d,n) reaction is a suitable and well-characterized
source of neutrons for calibrating neutron detectors in
the energy range 0.1 ≤ En ≤ 11.7 MeV due to its high
neutron ﬂux at the low- and high- energy ends [18–20].
In this measurement, we used a 7 MeV deuterium beam
at θlab=0 ◦, while the position of LENDA remained the
same as described above.

In addition to the neutron detector, a 4.5×5.0 cm
LaBr3:Ce scintillator was used to detect gamma rays as-
sociated with the 40Ar(p,n) reaction. The detector was
mounted at 90 ◦ relative to the beam axis and was 18 cm
away from the target. Gamma spectra from the LaBr
detector and particularly the yields of the gamma tran-
sitions associated with the excited levels of 40K were
used for qualitative analysis and cross-veriﬁcation of the
neutron detector results. These data were invaluable in
comprehending the detailed characteristics of the neutron
spectra, as described in the analysis section.

For getting a detailed picture of the photon emis-
sion as a function of proton energy, the gamma-ray data
were collected separately from the time-of-ﬂight measure-
ments. In this way, we were able to increase the energy
resolution by lowering the gas pressure in the cell and
take smaller energy steps. Twenty-ﬁve spectra were col-
lected in total for beam energies between 3.4 to 4.0 MeV
(with 25 keV step), while the pressure in the gas-cell was
98±5 Torr.

the experimental double diﬀerential cross sections over
the angle θ.

Fig. 3 shows schematically the portion of the 40K level
scheme that is relevant for our study at energies between
3.0 and 4.0 MeV in the center-of-mass system along with
the associated neutron transitions n0−3 assuming a re-
action proceeding via the formation of a 41K compound
nucleus. The kinetic energies of the emitted neutrons
from the various (p, nx) channels are expected to range
between 0.1 and 1.6 MeV.

Within the limits of the timing resolution of the system
as well as the energy resolution of the incident beam, the
peaks from the (p, n0) and (p, n1) channels were not ex-
pected to be resolved in the neutron spectra due to their
small diﬀerence in neutron time-of-ﬂight. As a result, cu-
mulative angular distributions and partial cross-sections
were obtained for the (p, n0,1) channels. Neutron peaks in
our spectra corresponding to these two channels spanned
the energy range of 1.0(cid:46) En0,n1

(cid:46)1.6 MeV.

For the (p, n2) and (p, n3) channels, the resolution
of the system was adequate to separate their neutrons
that were expected in the combined energy range of
0.1(cid:46) En2,n3
(cid:46)0.9 MeV. The fact that we observed no
neutrons (or gamma rays) from the (p, n3) channel sug-
gests that the corresponding partial cross-section was
too low compared to the sensitivity of our experiment.
Within our experimental uncertainties, the contribution
of the (p, n3) channel to the total cross-section was con-
sidered negligible compared to the dominant (p, n2) chan-

cited states in the residual nucleus along with the promi-
nent gamma-rays from the de-excitation of the residual nu-

The diﬀerential cross sections at angle θ and energy E

were calculated using the following relation:

(1)

where In is the number of detected neutrons, τd and (cid:15)n
are correction factors for the dead-time of the electronics
system and the intrinsic eﬃciency of LENDA, respec-
tively, Nt is the areal density of the target nuclei, Np is
the total number of beam particles impinging the target
during the measurement, and ∆Ω is the solid angle of
the detector. The number of detected neutrons In was
extracted from the time-of-ﬂight spectra after applying
particular thresholds levels in the output pulse heights of
the detector. By doing this, we were able to obtain the
corresponding neutron eﬃciencies (cid:15)n from the LENDA
eﬃciency data (see Section III A).

By collecting at least four data points for each angu-
lar distribution and converting the data to the center-of-
mass system, a least-squares ﬁt was then applied using
Legendre polynomial expansions of the form:

where Pi is the ith order Legendre polynomial. Hav-
ing properly reproduced the angular distributions in the

range from 0 ◦ to 180 ◦, the total cross sections were
obtained by integrating the ﬁt functions.

The total cross-section values and associated uncer-
tainties were estimated using a Monte-Carlo sampling
technique that took into account the experimental errors
of the diﬀerential cross-section measurements.
In this
analysis, the angular distribution data points were ran-
domly varied within the limits of their error-bars. For
each randomly chosen conﬁguration of points, an inte-
grated angular distribution was obtained. By repeating
this process N-times, we were able to create a distribu-
tion of angle-integrated cross-sections where its standard
deviation (σ) and mean value (µ) were used to deter-
mine the ﬁnal values of the cross-section and its error.
In order to assure that all the possible ﬁt functions are
taken into account in the estimate of the ﬁnal errors, the
data points were varied according to a ﬂat random dis-
tribution. Fig. 4 shows an example of an angular distri-
bution that was analyzed with the Monte-Carlo method
we describe here. All the distributions were ﬁtted using
Legendre polynomials up to the second order. In cases
of symmetrical distributions, only the even terms of the
expansion were included (e.g., Fig. 4). Any uncertainties
associated with the integration method on the ﬁt func-
tions were negligible.

In the following subsections, we provide details on the
analysis of the neutron eﬃciency necessary for the quan-
tiﬁcation of the cross-section in Eq. 1. We also describe
the analysis of gamma-ray spectra used to extract rela-
tive gamma-ray yields and to interpret the cross-section
results qualitatively.

A. Neutron Eﬃciency

1. Extraction of the detector eﬃciency curve

The neutron time-of-ﬂight spectrum of the 9Be(d,n)
reaction that we obtained with the LENDA detector for
the eﬃciency measurement is presented in Fig. 5. From
the neutron time-of-ﬂight, the kinetic energy of the neu-
trons was then deduced from:

En =

mnL2
2τ 2c2

(3)

where τ is the neutron time-of-ﬂight, L is the ﬂight path,
c is the speed of light, and mn=939.57 MeV.

We extracted the eﬃciency curve by comparing the
measured neutron yields at each energy bin, with the
“standard” yields from this reaction. The standard yields
were obtained from J.W. Meadows [20], while the mea-
sured yields were calculated as:

Yn =

In
τdNb∆Ω∆E

(4)

where In is the total number of counts in a particular
bin, τd is a correction factor for the dead-time of the elec-
tronics system, Nb is the integrated beam current (BCI)

5

during the run, ∆Ω is the solid angle of the detector, and
∆E is the bin size. A comparison between the neutron
yields from LENDA and those from the reference study
is displayed in Fig. 6. By adjusting the bin sizes accord-
ingly, the eﬃciency at each energy bin was given from
the ratio:

(cid:15)n =

[Yn]LEN DA
[Yn]Standard

(5)

The extracted eﬃciency curve is presented in Fig. 7,
where two diﬀerent threshold levels were applied to the
light output of the detector in oﬄine analysis. For the
analysis of neutron spectra from the 40Ar(p,n) reaction,
both the eﬃciency curves were used. The 60 keVee
threshold was applied for beam energies above 3.6 MeV
(center-of-mass system), and the 30 keVee was applied
for the lower energies to reﬂect the actual threshold of
the detector during these measurements.

The main uncertainties on the eﬃciency measurement
were introduced by the beam current integration, the
solid angle subtended by the detector, and the reference
neutron yields. A detailed summary of the associated
errors is given in Table I.

TABLE I. Uncertainties on the various quantities of Eqs. 4
& 5. Wherever a range of values is used, it indicates that
the corresponding error varied from data-point to data-point.
The ﬁnal uncertainty on the intrinsic neutron eﬃciency of
LENDA was extracted by adding these errors in quadratic.

2. Determination of eﬃciency for low energy neutrons

Due to the ﬁnite energy resolution of our system, which
was dominated by the energy loss of the beam in the tar-
get, the widths of the neutron peaks from the 40Ar(p,n)
reaction were about 100 keV. While the time-of-ﬂight res-
olution was enough to separate the energies of neutrons
coming from the target within 10 keV, all the neutrons
within the 100 keV range would be included inside a sin-
gle neutron peak. The energy resolution did not aﬀect the
analysis of the high energy neutron peaks (En >0.8 MeV)
negatively as the eﬃciency is relatively constant within
100 kev at these energies (see Fig. 7 for the eﬃciency at
a threshold of 30 keVee). The sharp drop of LENDA’s
intrinsic eﬃciency for En < 0.4 MeV, however, compli-
cated the determination of absolute yields for the low

the higher channel numbers, while the corresponding time-of-
ﬂight increases in the opposite direction.

the corresponding energy bin.

energy neutron peaks (0.2 < En < 0.4 MeV) in which
the shape of the rapidly increasing eﬃciency was convo-
luted with that of the reaction yield. In other words, the
energy width of each TOF-peak at low neutron energies
corresponded to a signiﬁcant variation of the neutron eﬃ-
ciency. We decoupled the eﬀect of the varying eﬃciency
inside the low energy neutron peaks by dividing them
into intervals of 10-15 keV. For each one of these energy
intervals, a weighting factor wi was obtained by dividing
the number of counts in that interval over the total num-
ber of counts on the neutron peak. Having extracted a

set of weighting factors, the cumulative eﬃciency of neu-
tron detection for the events in each peak was calculated
from the bin-wise yield as:

(cid:15)n =

N
(cid:88)

i=0

wi(cid:15)i

where N is the number of intervals, and (cid:15)i is the intrinsic
eﬃciency of LENDA at the corresponding energy of the
ith interval.

threshold levels on the output pulse heights of the detector.
The intrinsic eﬃciency below 1 MeV increases dramatically
for the lower threshold and reaches a peak of approximately
35% at 500 keV.

B. Gamma-ray spectra

We used Gamma-ray spectra to study the character-
istic gamma-rays from the 40Ar(p,n) reaction, as well as
to cross-check the time-of-ﬂight data. Fig. 8, shows a
gamma spectrum from the LaBr3 detector for Elab =
3.8 MeV. The majority of the detected gamma-rays came
from interactions of the proton beam with the argon gas,
the aluminum window of the gas-cell, and the surround-
ing materials along the beamline. The 770 keV peak
from the 40Ar(p,n2) channel was present in the spectrum
through all the measurements and was used to moni-
tor the ﬂuctuations of the cross-section. The 29.8 keV
gamma-rays from the ﬁrst excited state of 40K were also
identiﬁed; however, they could not be easily resolved
from the background photons in the low-energy region.
In contrast with the ﬁrst two excited states, the promi-
nent gamma-rays from the (p, n3) channel at 891 keV,
were completely absent from the spectra. This was an
indication that the partial cross-section of this channel is
too low.

By determining the counting rates for the 770 keV
gamma rays, we were able to investigate the behavior
of the excitation function as a function of proton energy.
This was done by extracting gamma-ray yields for the
(p, n2) channel at various incident energies. To avoid any
systematic uncertainties associated with the dead-time of
our electronics system, the yields were calculated relative
to the 844 keV gammas-rays from the 27Al(p,pγ1−0) re-
action. Diﬀerential cross sections for the inelastic scatter-
ing on 27Al at 90-deg and incident energies between 3.0
and 4.0 MeV, were retrieved from M.Chiari et al.
[21]
through the Ion Beam Analysis Nuclear Data Library
(IBANDL) [22]. By using the 844 keV gamma-ray peak

tion at the corresponding incident energy, and AE is a
correction factor that takes into account the eﬃciency
and the solid angle of the detector, as well as the areal
density of 40Ar in the gas target.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Qualitative interpretation of neutron and
gamma spectra, and statistical ﬂuctuations

A remarkable feature of the experimental data was
the ﬂuctuating character of the cross-section. We ob-
served ﬂuctuations through both the yield of the 770 keV
gamma-ray of the (p, n2) channel, and the neutron yield
in the peaks of the time-of-ﬂight spectra. The char-
acter of the ﬂuctuations we observed in each case was
dependent on the energy resolution of the correspond-
ing measurement. Fig. 9, shows the relative yield of the
770 keV gamma-ray as a function of beam energy. The
25 keV resolution of this phase of the measurement re-
veals a rapidly varying gamma-ray yield for reaction en-
ergies above 3.2 MeV in the center-of-mass, consistent
with the known T=5/2 Isobaric Analog States (IAS) of

8

FIG. 9. Gamma-ray relative yields from the (p, n2) channel.
The two broad structures observed in the excitation function
for incident energies above 3.2 MeV are attributed to two 41Ar
Isobaric Analog State resonances folded with Ericson type sta-
tistical ﬂuctuations of the cross-section. In the gamma spec-
tra, the Ericson ﬂuctuations are suppressed due to the 25 keV
energy resolution of the measurement that makes them ap-
pear mostly as a slowly ﬂuctuating “background” continuum
underneath the two broad IAS structures. The ﬂuctuations
were much more pronounced in the high-resolution time-of-
ﬂight spectra. There, the shape of the neutron peaks revealed
a signiﬁcant number of overlapping resonance-like structures
(see discussion and Fig. 10).

41Ar in 41K [23]. The IAS strength is mixed with the
T=3/2 natural 41K states that have a much narrower
width. This second contribution to the ﬂuctuating char-
acter of the average cross-section is revealed in detail us-
ing the higher-resolution neutron time-of-ﬂight spectra of
Fig. 10, that are taken with two diﬀerent pressures (198
and 414 Torr) of the argon target gas. Both spectra cor-
respond to the same incident energy and detector angle
but have diﬀerent argon target thicknesses. The pro-
ton energy of the beam after traversing the aluminum
window of the gas target is 3.6 MeV. The energy resolu-
tion of the proton beam is 90 and 170 keV for the low
and high-pressure case, respectively, and is dominated
by the energy that the beam particles lose in the target
gas before the onset of the nuclear reaction. Hence, in
Fig. 10, the blue spectrum corresponds to reaction ener-
gies in the range of 3.4–3.6 MeV, while the red spectrum
corresponds to the range of 3.5–3.6 MeV. Both neutron
spectra, therefore, correspond the higher energy part of
the gamma-ray spectrum of Fig. 9.

For a non-ﬂuctuating excitation function, the (p, nx)
peaks in both spectra (Fig. 10) would have the same
single-peak shape with an energy spread deﬁned by
the folding of the IAS resonance width and the neu-
tron energy resolution. The partial excitation functions,
however, are characterized by overlapping resonance-like

FIG. 10. Neutron time-of-ﬂight spectra for two diﬀerent tar-
get gas pressures, i.e., for two diﬀerent target thicknesses.
Both spectra correspond to the same beam energy (before
interacting with the target window) and angle. The struc-
tured patterns on the neutron peaks are the result of the
convolution of the Ericson ﬂuctuations with the resonant neu-
tron yields of the 41Ar isobaric analog states in 41K. For the
blue spectrum, the reaction energy ranges between 3.4 and
3.6 MeV. For the red spectrum, the reaction energy ranges
between 3.5 and 3.6 MeV. The diﬀerence in reaction energy
range results in an integration of a larger portion of the ﬂuc-
tuating excitation function in the blue spectrum than in the
red one. Consequently, more structures appear in the neutron
peaks, consistent with what would be expected by a ﬂuctuat-
ing cross-section (see discussion and Fig. 9).

structures, and the shape of the peaks changes accord-
ing to the fraction of the excitation function covered in
each measurement. The comparison of the two neutron
spectra of Fig. 10 suggests that the shape of the neutron
peaks is strongly aﬀected by the folding of Ericson ﬂuctu-
ations with the IAS resonances, and the energy resolution
of the measurement. As the beam energy loss increases
in the target with the increased pressure, the portion of
the excitation function probed increases too. As a re-
sult, the corresponding neutron peak becomes broader
in energy (or time-of-ﬂight), and the neutron yields re-
produce a ﬂuctuating excitation function for a broader
energy range than before.

The energy resolution of the neutron peaks depends
on the timing resolution of the system. Considering the
kinetic energies of the neutrons and the geometry of our
system, the neutron time of ﬂight energy resolution dur-
ing this experiment was of the order of 10 keV or less. For
example, for the low energy neutron peaks that appear
in Fig. 10 (right side), the resolution is ∼2.5 keV. Con-
sequently, the statistical ﬂuctuations of the cross-section
are reproduced by the neutron yields in great detail and
are seen in Fig. 10 superimposed on the IAS strength.

The ﬁne structure we observed in the neutron spec-
tra is typical of the region of nuclei we are studying and

we attribute it to statistical ﬂuctuations of the partial
cross sections [24]. The observation of these structures
is also in agreement with previous work in the literature
using the 40Ar(p,n), (p,p), and (p,α) reactions [15, 23]
that report on the superposition of the two types of con-
tributions. Statistical ﬂuctuations are expected in com-
pound nuclear reactions that proceed via highly-excited
overlapping states in the compound system and are in
agreement with various other studies of nuclear reactions
in this mass region where statistical ﬂuctuations of the
partial cross-sections were reported in literature [25–27].
As discussed in [24], the level interference eﬀects corre-
sponding to Ericson ﬂuctuations impact both the partial
cross-sections and the angular distributions. The par-
tial angular distributions tend to be asymmetric relative
to 90-deg, while the cross-sections tend to ﬂuctuate as
a function of energy with a period equal to the average
width Γ of the populated states. If the number of exit
channels is small, the total cross-section is also aﬀected.
These eﬀects are reduced when many exit channels are
integrated or when the energy resolution of the measure-
ment is much larger than Γ. As we will see in the fol-
lowing subsections, the results of our study agree with
the predictions of the statistical ﬂuctuations theory. The
agreement is evident in the partial cross-sections and an-
gular distributions, as well as in the result for the total
cross-section. While the observed ﬂuctuations are of par-
ticular interest, reporting a detailed ﬂuctuation analysis
of the results is complicated, particularly in the presence
of the isobaric analog resonance states, and would be out-
side of the scope of this article. This analysis is, therefore
left to be incorporated in future work. Here, we aim at
the extraction of the reaction rate based on the measured
energy averaged partial and total cross-sections.

B. Diﬀerential, partial, and total cross sections

The measured partial cross sections for six energies
are presented in Fig. 12. The corresponding values are
listed in Table II. All energies correspond to the center-
of-mass energy in the middle of the target, after taking
into account the energy loss in the aluminum window and
the argon gas. Energy losses were calculated using the
Monte-Carlo software SRIM [28].

A prominent drop of the cross-section is observed in
all the neutron channels at around 3.6 MeV. This trend
is consistent with the variation of the gamma-ray yields
from the (p, n2) channel (see Fig. 9 for Ep > 3.4 MeV)
in which Ericson ﬂuctuations are seen folded into the
broader T=5/2 isobaric analog resonance structure of
41Ar as discussed in the previous section. The 50 keV
resolution of the total cross-section measurement results
in a smoothing of the ﬂuctuating character of the cross-
section. The uncertainties on the partial cross-section
determination ﬂuctuated between 12.0 – 13.5% in σ0,1
and 14.0 – 22.5% in σ2. For the total cross-section σtot,
the corresponding uncertainty range is 9.0 – 11.5%.

The extracted diﬀerential cross sections are given in
Table IV. Their uncertainties varied between 15.0-33.0%.
In general, uncertainties above 20.0% mainly corre-
sponded to measurements of low energy neutrons (En (cid:46)
0.4 MeV) from the (p, n2) channel. This happened be-
cause the kinetic energies of those neutrons lie in a region
where the intrinsic eﬃciency of LENDA changes rapidly
(e.g., for Ecm=3.37 MeV, 200 < En < 400 keV). Due to
the convolution of the detector’s eﬃciency with the neu-
tron yields for those data points (see Section III A), the
total uncertainty was increased.

Overall, the primary sources of uncertainty were the
beam current integration, the intrinsic neutron eﬃciency,
the solid angle subtended by the neutron detector, and in
some cases the peak integration. A detailed error budget
is given in Table III. Any systematic uncertainties asso-
ciated with the shadowing of the target at 135-deg were
estimated to be much smaller than any statistical error
at this angle and were not treated separately.

In Fig. 11, we present all the neutron angular distri-
butions. The distributions of the (p, n2) channel were
found to vary as a function of energy and tended to be
asymmetrical relative to 90 ◦. According to the theory of
statistical ﬂuctuations [24], this behavior is expected for
the distributions of individual channels. However, any
features associated with this phenomenon should vanish
when the distributions are averaged over a suﬃciently
large energy interval or when various exit channels are
taken into account. The latter is demonstrated by the
symmetrical distributions of the (p, n0,1) channels, which
change smoothly with energy. Furthermore, by looking
at the energy averaged distributions (see Fig. 13) the
profound asymmetries on the (p, n2) channel also vanish.
This is an indication that the observed ﬂuctuations of the
cross-sections are purely statistical.

C. Theoretical calculations

To reproduce the experimental data, we performed sta-
tistical model calculations for incident energies between
3.0 and 4.0 MeV in the center-of-mass system, by us-
ing the Hauser-Feshbach code TALYS 1.9 [29]. In these
calculations, we adopted the semi-microscopic Optical
Model Potential (OMP) of Jeukenne-Lejeune-Mahaux
level densities and
[30], while for the description of

the most recently evaluated atomic mass data [34].

The three exit channels which are competing in the p
+ 40Ar reaction, are the (p,p), (p,n), and (p,α). The
parameters of the optical model for each one of the three
possible particles in the exit channel (neutrons, protons,
and alphas) are expected to inﬂuence the result of the
cross-section calculation. To get a better description of
the partial cross-sections for the (p,n) channel, we ad-
justed the OMP transmission coeﬃcients only for neu-
trons and alphas. The alpha-nucleus optical potential
is typically more uncertain than the proton-nucleus one
(see e.g., [35]). Therefore, to limit the number of tuned
parameters, the corresponding proton transmission co-
eﬃcients remained unchanged. The transmission coef-
ﬁcients were adjusted using the keyword ‘Tljadjust’ of
TALYS, while all the other parameters in the code re-
mained ﬁxed. The ‘Tljadjust’ parameter allows the user
to multiply the transmission coeﬃcients with a diﬀerent
factor for each particle and orbital angular momentum L.
The range of L-values for which we calculated the trans-
mission coeﬃcients depends on the populated spins in
the compound system. We applied corrections up to the
maximum L that was given by the models used in the
TALYS calculation for the energy range of our interest.
The limit of Lmax was 5 for neutrons, and 11 for alphas.
The optimum set of multiplication factors for the trans-
mission coeﬃcients was extracted based on the quality
of the cross-section ﬁts. For the diﬀerent input param-
eters, the ﬁt quality was evaluated by using Pearson’s
chi-squared formula:

1. Calculations of Cross-Sections and Angular distributions

The results from the statistical model calculations are
summarized in Figs. 12 & 13. Since the cross-sections
were characterized by signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations, the data
cannot be precisely reproduced within the Hauser-
Feshbach framework that calculates energy-averaged
cross-sections. We expect, however, that the energy-
averaged angular distributions will be reproduced accu-
rately in shape and magnitude, and the general trend of
the cross-sections variation as a function of energy should
be reproduced reasonably. Here we make a comparison
between theoretical and experimental cross-sections. We
evaluate the agreement of the calculation with data using
the chi-square deviation of the two (see Eq. 8).

By using the default -tabulated- parameters for the
real and imaginary OMP components in TALYS, all the
corresponding partial cross-sections were overestimated.
To investigate the impact of the existing uncertainties
on these parameters, we repeated the calculations after
varying the JLM normalization factors λV (real central),
λV 1 (real isovector), λW (imaginary central), and λW 1
(imaginary isovector) within their suggested limits [30].
The maximum variations of the theoretical cross-sections
are presented as error-bands in Fig. 12. On average, the
deviations from the best ﬁt-line were around 20% for
(p,n0,1), and 100% (factor of two) for (p,n2). The latter

disagreement ampliﬁes the discrepancy between theory
and experiment for the total cross-section, which was of
the order of 30%.

For getting a more accurate description of the par-
tial cross-sections within the statistical model approach,
we modiﬁed the initial alpha and neutron transmission
coeﬃcients as described at the beginning of this sec-
tion. Speciﬁcally, we increased all the alpha transmis-
sion coeﬃcients by a factor of 2.2, while for neutrons,
we decreased them by 60% for L=0,1 and 10% for L>1.
The ﬁnal transmission coeﬃcients are given in Tables
VI,VII,VIII.

The partial cross-sections of the (p,n0,1) channels were
found to be equally sensitive to all the involved transmis-
sion coeﬃcients. On the other hand, the (p,n2) channel
was mainly sensitive to the L=0 and L=1 components.
For this reason, the main modiﬁcations to the neutron
transmission coeﬃcients were done for the low L-values.
This can be explained by the fact that in our models,
the populated spin distribution in the compound system
peaks at J=2.5. Since the 2nd excited state of the resid-
ual nucleus (40K) has J=2, an outgoing neutron from this
transition is more likely to have L=0 or L=1.

By using the modiﬁed transmission coeﬃcients, we cal-
culated the neutron angular distributions for the various
exit channels. The results are presented in Fig. 13, where
the calculated distributions are compared with the exper-
imental data. To minimize the eﬀects of the statistical

40Ar(p,n)40K reaction. The theoretical cross-sections have
been calculated using the TALYS code as described in the
text. The error-band shows the maximum variations of the
calculations due to uncertainties in the tabulated JLM opti-
cal potential parameters include with TALYS (default label).
The “modiﬁed” model, is a calculation in which the neutron
and alpha transmission coeﬃcients using the same tabulated
JLM parameters [30], were adjusted to properly reproduce
the experimental data.

ﬂuctuations, we compared the energy averaged distribu-
tions. The average was evaluated over the range 3.33
– 3.92 MeV in the center-of-mass system. The theoret-
ical angular distributions were found to be in a better
agreement with the experimental data when the modi-
ﬁed transmission coeﬃcients were used. This result is
consistent with the calculations on the partial and total
cross sections and veriﬁes the aptness of our modiﬁca-
tions. The fact that a signiﬁcant part of the observed
discrepancies on the total cross sections was related to
the (p,n2) channel, highlights the importance of analyz-
ing individual exit channels when constraining nuclear
models.

2. Astrophysical reaction rates

FIG. 13. Experimental and theoretical energy-averaged an-
gular distributions of the 40Ar(p,n)40K reaction. The distri-
butions are averaged over the energy range 3.33 to 3.92 MeV.
A better agreement between the results, is observed when the
modiﬁed transmission coeﬃcients are used (see also Fig. 12).

In this mode, TALYS calculates the reac-
“astro y”.
tion rate for the target in the ground state as well as
in a distribution of excited states populated according
to a Boltzmann distribution. The detailed results are
given in Table V. The current calculation of the ther-
monuclear rate is based on the experimental cross-section
that we measured in this work using proton energies be-
tween 3 and 4 MeV. The equivalent neutron energies for
the reverse reaction that destroys 40K, i.e., the exother-
mic 40K(n,p)40Ar reaction, would lie between 1.0 and
1.6 MeV. Considering the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu-
tion widths (and the Gamow-Window for protons), the
energies that we performed the measurement correspond
to astrophysical temperatures above 4.5 GK. By compar-
ing the experimentally constrained rate with the one of
REACLIB (see Fig. 14), we observe that above 4.5 GK
the two rates diﬀer by over a factor of two. In the range
below 1 GK, which is relevant to stellar nucleosynthesis,
the diﬀerence is over 80%.

To extract the reaction rate of the 40K(n,p)40Ar reac-

tion, we used the detailed balance condition [36]:

In Fig. 14, we present the calculated astrophysical reac-
tion rate for the 40Ar(p,n)40K reaction, using the modi-
ﬁed transmission coeﬃcients from this study. The cal-
culation was performed in TALYS using the keyword

zero values for T<0.4 GK preventing the calculation of
the detailed-balance (n,p) below that temperature. To
extend the detailed-balance data-set to temperatures be-
low 0.4 GK, which are relevant for stellar nucleosynthesis,
we chose to apply an exponential extrapolation (dashed
blue line). The extrapolation was done based on the
calculated rates at the temperature range between 0.4
and 1 GK. This extrapolation retained the trend of the
detailed-balance rate below 0.4 GK without producing
a nonphysical kink as it would be the case if we used
one of the modiﬁed TALYS or scaled REACLIB calcu-
lations to extrapolate. We consider this extrapolation
choice justiﬁed, since in the range between 0.2 – 8 GK,
the reaction rates from detailed balance (solid and dashed
blue), scaled REACLIB (red), and TALYS (green) are in
agreement within 5%. Moreover, this discrepancy is well
within the average experimental uncertainty of ∼15%
(grey error-band), while the smoothness of the extrapola-
tion is retained. In contrast to this agreement, the REA-
CLIB rate diﬀers by -up to- 40% from the experimentally
constrained ones in the temperature range between 0.2 –
10 GK. This discrepancy is expected to have implications
on stellar nucleosynthesis calculations for the abundance
of 40K produced by the s-process, as the 40K(n,p)40Ar
reaction is partially responsible for its destruction.

3. Network Calculations

During the stellar evolution of a massive star, 40K
can be created both through fusion reactions during car-
bon and neon burning and via neutron capture reactions
in the helium-burning core (s-process) [37]. The latter
mechanism can also occur in the thermally unstable He
inter-shells of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars [38].
The s-process in massive stars is considered to be the
dominant mechanism. In any case, due to the existence
of these various components, an accurate calculation of
stellar yields for 40K is a rather tricky task. Further-
more, considering the destruction of s-process materials
due to the mixing of shells in the stellar interior, the
situation becomes even more complicated. Nevertheless,
by studying each of the above components individually,
any inaccuracies on determining the stellar yields can be
reduced.

We can get an insight into the potential eﬀect of the
reaction rates measured in this work on abundance cal-
culations by considering a simple case of nucleosynthesis
for 40K. Here, we focus on the study of s-process nucle-
osynthesis in the context of the classical model [39], and
we investigate the impact of the 40K(n,p)40Ar reaction
on the abundance of 40K.

Single-zone network calculations were performed using
the open-source code NucnetTools [40]. For the initial
zone-composition, we considered the solar abundances
up to 58Fe [41]. The temperature and mass density of
the zone were set to 0.3 GK and 1000 g/cm3, respec-
tively, while during the calculation, the neutron den-

the forward and reverse reactions (NA is the Avogadro
number), A and J are the mass numbers in a.m.u and
the ground state spins of the involved nuclei, k is the
Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, Q(p,n) is the
Q-value of the endothermic reaction, and G(T ) are the
temperature-dependent partition functions that corre-
spond to the excited state spectrum of the Ar and K
nuclei (calculated using the TALYS code). Using the
above formula both the ground and excited states in the
entrance and exit channel of the reaction are taken into
account in the calculation of the reverse reaction rate.
The results of these calculations are given in Table V,
along with the partition functions that we used.

In Fig. 15, we compare the extracted rate for the
40K(n,p)40Ar reaction (blue line) with the recommended
values adopted in the REACLIB V2.2 library (yellow
line). In the same graph, we include the corresponding
reaction rate calculated using the modiﬁed transmission
coeﬃcients from this study (green line). A detailed com-
parison of the reaction rates is shown in the lower panel
of Fig. 15, where the deviation D is deﬁned as:

the rates below 0.4 GK are zero. The reverse (n,p) rate was calculated by applying the detailed balance conditions (see

sity was ﬁxed to 108 neutrons/cm3. These conditions
were derived based on the classical s-process model ap-
proach [39, 42]. The reaction network included all the
relevant (n,γ), (n,p), (n,α), β+, and β− reactions, while
the corresponding thermonuclear reactions rates were re-
trieved from the JINA REACLIB library. In this calcu-
lation, the system evolved for ∼105 years.

Fig. 16, shows the time evolution of the mass fraction
of 40K according to the above network calculation. Dur-
ing the evolution of the system, the mass fraction of 40K
peaks at two diﬀerent times. That happened because the
reaction ﬂow through 40K depends on the abundance evo-
lution of the lighter elements in the reaction chain. The
latter is aﬀected by the initial zone composition, which
adds an extra level of complexity in the calculation. To
investigate the impact of the 40K(n,p)40Ar reaction on
the ﬁnal 40K yields, we repeated the calculation using the
extracted thermonuclear rate from this study. The corre-
sponding rate at 0.3 GK, was obtained after extrapolat-
ing the calculated data for temperatures below 0.4 GK,
as described in the previous section. Based on the trend
of the extrapolated curve, the induced error due to the
extrapolation at 0.3 GK is well within the experimen-
tal error of 15% (see Fig. 15). The yellow error-band in
Fig. 16 represents the upper-limits of this error.

The results of this network calculation show that the
abundance of 40K produced by s-process within a period
of time of 105 years is overestimated by up-to 8.5±1.2%
when the REACLIB library rate is used. Previous stud-

ies on stellar nucleosynthesis [4], revealed sensitivity of
the order of 20–30% for the stellar yields of 40K depend-
ing on the choice of theoretical reaction rate. The result
was based on a comparison between the rate currently
adopted by JINA REACLIB and the previously recom-
mended calculation [43]. Those yield variations were
linked to the individual reaction rates that are respon-
sible for the formation and destruction of 40K. It is gen-
erally considered in the community that Hauser-Feshbach
calculations are supposed to be accurate within approxi-
mately a factor of two. In the present study, we provide
an experimental rate for the 40K(n,p)40Ar reaction. The
well-deﬁned uncertainty of the order of 15% for the ex-
perimental rate at the energies of interest is a signiﬁcant
improvement over the typical factor-of-two uncertainty
of the calculated rate. The reduction in uncertainty is il-
lustrated in Fig. 16. Even though many factors must be
taken into account to obtain accurate ﬁnal stellar yields,
our measurement provides a signiﬁcant constraint the un-
certainties associated with the destruction rate of 40K
and can be used to inform future studies of the relevant
s-process component of 40K nucleosynthesis.

V. CONCLUSION

We measured the total and partial cross-sections of
the reaction 40Ar(p,n)40K for incident proton beam en-
ergies between 3.0 - 4.0 MeV. We found that all the cross-

from the Hauser-Feshbach calculations on the 40Ar(p,n)40K
reaction, using the principle of detailed balance (see Eq. 9).
For temperatures below 0.4 GK an exponential extrapola-
tion was applied as described in the text. The grey error-
band, marks the limits of the average experimental uncer-
tainty. The green line, represents the same reaction rate but
calculated using the modiﬁed transmission coeﬃcients from
this study (Hauser-Feshbach calculation with TALYS). In the
same graph, the reaction rate from the REACLIB library is
also displayed (“rath” rate by Rausher et al. [36], yellow line).

between the various reaction rates, relative to the reference
rate obtained from detailed balance. The deviations are cal-
culated using Eq. 10. The REACLIB rate is systematically
above the limits of the experimental uncertainty, and devia-
tions up to ∼40% are observed. On the other hand, the scaled
REACLIB rate and the TALYS rate (with modiﬁed TL) are
in a very good agreement with the reference curve.

sections vary considerably as a function of energy within
our experimental resolution. In individual neutron chan-
nels, the shapes of the angular distributions were aﬀected
by statistical ﬂuctuations. These variations in the cross-
section were found to be consistent with theoretical pre-
dictions and previous work available in the literature.

To reproduce the experimental data using the Hauser-
Feshbach theory, we extracted an improved set of neu-
tron, proton, and alpha transmission coeﬃcients from
statistical model calculations. Based on these opti-
mum transmission coeﬃcients,
improved astrophysical
reaction rates were calculated for the 40Ar(p,n)40K and
40K(n,p)40Ar reactions.

The new reaction rates were found to be consider-
ably higher than the rates currently available in REA-
CLIB. Using the experimentally constrained rates, we

ent rates of the 40K(n,p)40Ar reaction. The grey error-band
highlights the sensitivity of the mass fraction of 40K on the
variation of the library rate by a factor of two. The yellow

tainty on the experimental reaction rate, which is ∼15%. The
lower panel displays the ratio of the two mass fractions when
the numerator of the ratio corresponds to the calculations us-
ing the REACLIB rate. The new experimentally constrained
rate suggests a factor of 1.39 increase in the destruction rate
of 40K, and a close to 10% reduction in the production of 40K
after a period of 105 yrs.

performed network calculations to investigate the impli-
cations of this result on s-process nucleosynthesis of 40K.
We found that the abundance of 40K can be overesti-
mated by ∼10% when using the REACLIB rate in net-
work calculations. The experimental measurement re-
moves a signiﬁcant portion of the previous theoretical
uncertainty on the 40K yields from stellar evolution cal-
culations.

The initial mass fraction of 40K during the formation of
a cosmochemically earth-like exoplanet aﬀects the time
evolution of the radiogenic heating of the planet. The
heating rate has implications on the planet’s geological
activity, greenhouse gas recycling in the planet’s atmo-
sphere, and eventually to the planet’s habitability. Cur-
rently, age-dependent predictions for such crucial phe-
nomena are made by using galactic chemical evolution
(GCE) models. The results from our study can improve
the predictions of stellar yields of 40K at the time of the
planet’s formation, a critical input parameter for such
GCE models.

Future measurements with proton energies below
2.5 MeV would provide useful information for the cross-
sections inside the Gamow-Window for stellar temper-
atures. Such studies would further constrain the rate

16

of the 40K(n,p)40Ar reaction during stellar nucleosynthe-
sis. Also, measurements on the 40K(n,α)37Cl reaction at
astrophysical energies would be particularly useful. Con-
straining all the relevant reaction channels which are re-
sponsible for the destruction of 40K during stellar evolu-
tion, will further improve the accuracy of the astrophys-
ical models in predicting the stellar yields of 40K.
