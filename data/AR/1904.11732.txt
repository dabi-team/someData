ABSTRACT  

X-ray  photoemission  spectroscopy  (XPS)  depth  profiling  using  monoatomic  Ar+  ion  etching 

sources is a common technique that allows for the probing of the vertical compositional profiles 

of a wide range of materials. In polymer-based organic photovoltaic devices, it is commonly used 

to  study  compositional  variations  across  the  interfaces  of  the  organic  active  layer  with  charge 

extraction  layers  or  electrodes,  as  well  as  the  vertical  phase  separation  within  the  bulk-

heterojunction active layer. It is generally considered that the damage induced by the etching of 

organic layers is limited to the very top surface, such that the XPS signal (acquired from the top 

~10 nm of the layer) remains largely unaffected, allowing for a reliable measurement of the sample 

composition throughout the depth profile. Herein, we investigate a range of conjugated polymers 

1 

 
and quantify the depth of the damage induced by monoatomic etching for Ar+ ion energies ranging 

from 0.5 keV to 4 keV using argon gas cluster ion beam depth profiling. The results demonstrate 

that even when etching with the lowest available monoatomic ion energy for as little as 3 s, the 

damaged polymer material extends deeper into the bulk than the XPS probing depth. We show that 

the  damaged  material  distorts  the  compositional  information  obtained  by  XPS,  resulting  in 

erroneous depth profiles. Furthermore, we propose that only gas cluster ion beam etching sources 

should be used for depth profiling of organic conjugated polymers, as those induce significantly 

less damage and maintain the compositional information throughout the entire profile. 

INTRODUCTION  

Over the past two decades, significant advances in the field of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices 

have resulted in a steady increase in power conversion efficiencies, which have reached 14.2% 

and 17.3% for single and double junction PVs, respectively.1-2 The active layer of these devices 

consists of a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blend of organic donor and acceptor materials. While spin-

coating is a well-established method for the production of BHJs, there are still issues that need to 

be  addressed  in  order  to  improve  both  device  performance  and  reproducibility.  For  example, 

during  film  processing,  de-mixing  and  crystallization  heavily  affect  the  blend’s  nano-  and 

microstructure.3-5 The resulting domain sizes influence fundamental processes such as exciton and 

charge transport,6-7 while the surface compositions determine interfacial properties, such as charge 

separation  efficiency  and  recombination.8  Therefore,  understanding  the  bulk  and  surface 

morphologies and composition is a key factor for controlling and improving the performance of 

OPVs.

X-ray  photoemission  spectroscopy  (XPS)  probes  the  elemental  composition  and  chemical 

environment of the surface of a film, specifically the top 5-10 nm. When combined with sputtering 

and etching techniques, it can be used to create depth profiles and access this information for both 

the bulk of a material and buried interfaces of a device, making it an essential tool for the study of 

OPVs. Numerous organic material systems, including both full devices and semiconductor films, 

have been investigated using XPS depth profiling, wherein small projectiles, such as argon ions, 

most commonly make up the sputtering beam. For example, we and others have used this method 

to study phase separation in poly(3-hexylthiophen-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric 

acid  methyl  ester (PCBM) BHJ  films, which  form a P3HT-rich layer  at the air interface and  a 

PCBM-rich  layer  at  the  bottom  interface.9-13  Similarly,  we  found  that  P3HT  and  poly[(9,9-

dioctyluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(3-hexylthien-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-2’,2’’-diyl] 

(F8TBT) 

BHJs exhibit an enriched P3HT top layer due to its lower surface energy.14 XPS depth profiling 

has also been applied to study vertical phase separation in other BHJ organic systems15 and ternary 

blends,16  as  well  as  effects  of  interfacial  modifications.17  Furthermore,  XPS  depth  profiles  can 

provide insight into degradation mechanisms in organic electronic devices, thereby tackling the 

issue  of  long-term  stability.  In  one  example,  Dupont  et  al.  investigated  moisture-assisted 

decohesion  of  poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene  sulfonate  (PEDOT:PSS)  films  by 

tracking  the  oxygen  concentration  throughout  the  film  by  XPS.18  In  another,  Kumar  et  al. 

monitored degradation and regeneration processes of P3HT:PCBM BHJ solar cells revealing the 

chemical reactions taking place at the active layer/cathode interface.19 These examples are only a 

small sample of the numerous studies in which XPS depth profiling has been applied to the study 

of  organic  materials  and  organic  electronic  devices.  Furthermore,  this  technique  has  also  been 

3 

 
applied  to  the  study  of  hybrid  organic-inorganic  devices20-22  and  most  recently  to  lead  halide 

perovskite devices23-26 - all of which contain organic materials as part of the device structure.  

However, the validity of the XPS depth profile result relies on the assumption that any damage 

induced by the etching process is limited to the very top surface of the remaining material, such 

that due to its relatively high probing depth (~10 nm), the XPS signal originates predominantly 

from deeper, undamaged material. While this has been shown to be the case for many inorganic 

materials,27 this is not necessarily the case for soft organic materials.  It is important to keep in 

mind  that  non-negligible  damage  may  be  introduced  to  the  surface  as  well  as  the  underlying 

organic  layers  upon  ion  impact.  This  damage  may  take  many  forms,  for  example:  molecular 

fragmentation, reduction, cross-linking or preferential etching. The formation of surface damage 

is especially critical when trying to extract exact compositional profiles and chemical states from 

the measurement. It is thus necessary to quantify the damage induced by monoatomic etching and 

compare it to the probing depth of XPS (~10 nm). Despite the common use of XPS depth profiling 

in organic electronics research, the damage depth of monoatomic etching has never been quantified 

for any organic conjugated polymers.  

One  possible  method  to  quantify  the  depth  of  damaged  material  is  based  on  the  use  of  an 

alternative,  non-detrimental  sputtering  technique  utilizing  gas  cluster  ion  beams  (GCIB)  or 

molecular  clusters.  Such  gentler  sputtering  techniques  were  first  explored  in  combination  with 

secondary  ion  mass  spectrometry  (SIMS),28-32  but  more  recently  have  also  been  employed  in 

combination  with  XPS,33-34  allowing  for  an  essentially  damage  free  depth  profiling  of  organic 

materials.35-36 For example, in the case of PEDOT:PSS films, Yun et al. have shown that while 

monoatomic  Ar+  etching  alters  the  bonding  states  of  C,  S  and  O,  changing  the  chemical 

4 

 
composition  of  the  bulk  material,  argon  cluster  etching  preserves  the  PEDOT:PSS  core  level 

structure.37  

To quantify the damage induced by a monoatomic Ar+ beam, one strategy is to first etch for a set 

period of time using a monoatomic beam, and then follow this step with a depth profile using an 

argon GCIB until the original material compositional structure is recovered. Such an approach was 

used by Miyayama et al., who reported that polyimide (PI) surfaces exhibited damaged N species, 

and reduced N and O content upon  monoatomic  Ar+ ion etching, which could subsequently be 

removed using an argon GCIB of 10 keV, with only 17% damaged N species remaining.38 The 

dose required to remove the damaged layers scaled linearly with the monoatomic Ar+ beam energy. 

Similarly, Yancey and coworkers observed a reduction of O and F in poly(ethylene terephthalate) 

(PET) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), respectively, upon monoatomic Ar+ ion sputtering with 

the damaged layers being entirely removed using an argon GCIB.27 

Herein,  we  investigate  and  quantify  the  damage  induced  by  monoatomic  Ar+  sputtering  on 

conjugated polymers, such as those used in organic electronic devices. We focus on four polymers 

which are frequently used in organic electronic devices: regioregular and regiorandom P3HT (c-

P3HT 

and 

a-P3HT, 

respectively), 

poly[(9,9-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-

(benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazol-4,8-diyl)] 

(F8BT),  poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-

b’]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) 

(PTB7), and poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']dithiophene-2,6-diyl-

alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl)] 

(PCE10).  We 

apply an argon GCIB to perform XPS depth profiles on pristine films, as well as films that have 

been previously etched for 3 s with a monoatomic Ar+ beam. The depth profiles of pristine films 

show  no  significant  changes,  confirming  that  the  GCIB  is  indeed  non-detrimental  to  the 

5 

 
investigated polymers. However, 3 s of monoatomic etching is enough to change the depth profiles 

drastically, revealing the detrimental effect of the argon ions on these polymers, observed in the 

form of XPS peak broadening, broken bonds and altered atomic ratios. We successfully remove 

the layers that were damaged by the monoatomic etching with cluster etching and gain quantitative 

information about the damage depth of monoatomic etching. We find that the damage depth scales 

linearly  with  the  monoatomic  etch  energy  while  the  exact  magnitude  is  material  but  not 

crystallinity dependent. Most importantly, we find that the damage depth is larger than the XPS 

probing depth even for the lowest possible monoatomic Ar+ ion energy of 0.5 keV, indicating that 

XPS depth profiling based on monoatomic Ar+ is not suitable for conjugated polymers and the 

data  must  be  treated  carefully.  We  hope  our  work  will  motivate  researchers  to  avoid  using 

monoatomic etching for XPS depth profiling of organic layers or organic electronic devices and 

provide guidelines for future analysis of such studies. 

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 

Materials Regiorandom P3HT (RR < 80), regioregular P3HT (RR > 96), PTB7 and PCE10 were 

purchased from 1-Material, and F8BT was purchased from Ossila. Their chemical structures are 

shown in Figure 1. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All materials were 

used as received.

Sample preparation The samples were prepared in ambient conditions. First, ITO-coated glass 

sheets (MSE Supplies) were cut into (20x20) mm2 substrates and then subsequently sonicated in 

acetone  and  isopropanol  for  5  min  each,  followed  by  a  10  min  oxygen  plasma  treatment. 

Afterwards, the zinc oxide (ZnO) sol-gel was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 45 s and annealed at 200 

°C for 30 min.39-40 Next, the polymer solutions were prepared in concentrations ranging from 15 

mg/ml to 50 mg/ml depending on the material; P3HT and PCE10 were dissolved in chlorobenzene, 

PTB7 in chloroform, and F8BT in toluene. The polymer solutions were spin-coated on top of the 

ZnO layer at 1000 rpm to 2000 rpm for 45 s depending on the polymer. Optionally, the polymer 

films were annealed for 10 min; P3HT and PCE10 at 140 °C, PTB7 at 80 °C, and F8BT at 155 °C.  

X-Ray  Photoemission  Spectroscopy  (XPS)  and  Etching  The  samples  were  transferred  to  an 

ultrahigh vacuum chamber (ESCALAB 250Xi by Thermo Scientific) for XPS measurements and 

etching. XPS measurements were carried out using a XR6 monochromated Al Kα source (hν = 

1486.6 eV), a pass energy of 20 eV and an oval measurement spot with a long axis of 900 µm. 

7 

 
 
Etching  was  carried  out  with  the  MAGCIS  dual  mode  ion  source,  which  can  be  operated  as  a 

monoatomic argon ion source or as an argon gas cluster ion source. The monoatomic mode was 

operated at energies ranging from 0.5 keV to 4 keV, and the cluster mode always at 4 keV with 

‘large’ clusters (Ar2000

+). The etched spot was (2x2) mm2 in size.  

Measurement procedure The measurement procedure is schematically depicted in Figure 2. First, 

a  spot  on  the  surface  of  the  polymer  film  was  etched  with  the  monoatomic  Ar+  beam  for  3  s, 

creating  damage  within  the  film.  This  short  duration  of  etching  is  insufficient  to  remove  any 

substantial amount of material from the film surface, but already induces damage in the film. Next, 

the spot was depth-profiled with the argon cluster beam (4 keV) until the polymer/ZnO interface 

was reached. The time of the cluster etch steps was adapted to each material individually to achieve 

a depth resolution of roughly 3 nm for the top 50 nm of the film. Afterwards, the resolution was 

decreased  so  that  etching  would  be  faster  while  approaching  the  interface.  XPS  spectra  were 

recorded in  between  each etching  step. The  reference  depth  profile (cluster 4  keV) follows the 

same procedure but without the 3 s of monoatomic etching. We determined the etch time to etch 

depth  conversion  by  evaluating  the  time  needed  to  reach  the  polymer/ZnO  interface,  and 

measuring the etched polymer film thickness with a DektakXT profilometer (Bruker). Usually, the 

damage from monoatomic source etching was tracked by an increased full width at half maximum 

(FWHM) of the XPS peaks. The choice of monitoring the evolution of the FWHM, rather than 

introducing new peaks in order to fit the spectra of the damaged layers, was motivated by the fact 

that the latter procedure  would entail  speculative decisions about the number of peaks  that  are 

associated  with  damaged  chemical  species  and  their  relative  ratios,  and  would  not  provide 

definitive information about the species formed as a result of the etching. Therefore, the FWHM 

over-etch depth was plotted in comparison to the cluster-only reference measurement to extract 

8 

 
the  monoatomic  source  etching  induced  damage  depth.  The  measurement  uncertainties  in  film 

thickness  and  etch  time  generally  resulted  in  an  etch  depth  error  of  5-10%.  In  total,  five 

monoatomic etch energies were tested: 0.5 keV, 1 keV, 2 keV, 3 keV, and 4 keV. All spots that 

were etched with the monoatomic source and the reference spot were located on the same sample. 

Figure 2. Schematic of the experimental procedure. First, the polymer surface is etched with a 

monoatomic argon ion beam for 3 s creating damage at the surface and the underlying layers of 

the polymer. Then the polymer film is depth profiled using an argon GCIB until the polymer/ZnO 

interface is  reached.  From  the resulting FWHM  depth  profile, the damage depth  xdamage can be 

extracted. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

Quantification of the damage depth 

P3HT is one of the most investigated organic conjugated polymers, with applications in a range of 

optoelectronic devices.41 We begin by investigating the damage induced in amorphous P3HT (a-

P3HT) by argon etching. Prior to etching, the FWHM of the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks is in the 

9 

 
 
range 0.80 to 0.85 eV. Upon cluster etching at 4 keV, the FWHM increases slightly, to just under 

0.90 eV. The shapes of the S 2p doublet and the FWHM are preserved throughout the profile, even 

upon cluster etching for longer than 2000 s. The S 2p peak evolution through 2000 s can be seen 

in  Figure  3a.  The  S  2p  peak  evolution  shown  in  Figure  3b  starts  with  a  reference  surface 

measurement  before  etching.  After  this  initial  measurement,  the  spot  is  bombarded  with  a 

monoatomic beam for 3 s at 3 keV monoatomic Ar+ ion energy, and measurement through argon 

cluster depth profiling continues as in Figure 3a. It is clear that the monoatomic etching causes 

significant changes: the S 2p peak is shifted to lower binding energies and appears broadened with 

a FWHM of up to 1.4 eV. Both changes indicate that the C-S bonds in the P3HT film have been 

damaged by the short monoatomic etching. Cluster depth profiling the spot that was etched using 

the monoatmic Ar+ source gradually reduces the broadening and shift, eventually uncovering an S 

2p peak shape like the one shown in Figure 3a. A more detailed evaluation of the FWHM reveals 

that  it takes approximately 700  s to  remove the damaged a-P3HT,  corresponding to  a depth  of 

approximately  40  nm.  In  summary,  these  findings  demonstrate  that  while  3  s  of  monoatomic 

etching barely removes any material from the surface, it is already sufficient to cause significant 

damage deep inside the film. Furthermore, cluster etching is capable of removing the material that 

has  been  damaged  by  monoatomic  etching,  allowing  for  accurate  quantification  of  the  damage 

depth.

profile (4 keV) and (b) before and after 3 s of monoatomic etching (3 keV) followed by a cluster 

depth profile (4 keV); the spectra were aligned to the energy of the respective S 2p3/2 peak before 

etching. The red box marks the spectra damaged by monoatomic etching. Respective cluster etch 

times are given on the right-hand side of each spectrum.  

To  identify  the  damage  depth  for  various  ion  energies,  the  experiments  were  repeated  with 

monoatomic ion energies ranging from 0.5 keV to 4 keV, with the FWHM of the collected S 2p 

spectra  shown  as  a  function  of  depth  in  Figure  4a.  The  reference  measurement  shows  that  the 

FWHM  increases  slightly  upon  cluster  etching  and  stabilizes  just  below  0.9  eV  as  the  layer  is 

gradually removed. In contrast, etching with the monoatomic beam for 3s increases the FWHM by 

up to 70% when compared to the initial value. Damage induced by a high monoatomic etch energy 

results in a larger increase in FWHM that reaches deeper into the film bulk. When all the damaged 

material has been removed by cluster etching, the FWHM is restored to the value of the reference 

measurement. The same trend can be seen in the C 1s spectra (Figure 4b). The point at which the 

FWHM returns to the level of the reference measurement was defined as the damage depth caused 

11 

 
 
by monoatomic etching. The damage depth values extracted from the S 2p and the C 1s spectra 

are in good agreement with each other (Figure 4c).  

It is interesting to compare the extracted damage depths to the Ar ion penetration depth estimated 

by the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM) program.42 We find that the penetration depth 

varies from 9 nm for 1 keV ion energy to 20 nm for 4 keV Ar ions. These estimated penetration 

depths are substantially smaller than the measured damage depths, suggesting that much of the 

damage in the deeper layers is associated with propagation of free radicals that are formed during 

the etching process, rather than the Ar ions themselves. 

12 

 
 
Figure 4. FWHM depth profiles of (a) S 2p and (b) C 1s measured on an annealed a-P3HT film. 

Shown is the cluster reference measurement and five measurement spots that have been exposed 

to 3 s of monoatomic etching of different energies. The damage depth with respect to monoatomic 

source energy obtained from the S 2p and C 1s FWHM profiles is shown in (c). 

The conjugated polymers used in organic electronic devices show varying degrees of crystallinity 

depending on their chemical structure and processing parameters. To investigate whether material 

crystallinity  plays  any  role  in  determining  the  depth  of  the  induced  damage,  we  repeated  the 

experiment on samples of regioregular and regiorandom P3HT,43 which were either measured as 

cast or annealed to induce different levels of crystallization. This allowed us to compare results 

from  films with  varying  degrees of  crystallinity  with  unannealed regiorandom  P3HT (a-P3HT) 

being the most amorphous and annealed regioregular P3HT (c-P3HT) being the most crystalline 

film. The damage depth was then extracted from the respective S 2p FWHM depth profiles, as 

shown in Figure 3a for annealed a-P3HT and Figure S1 in the supplementary information (SI) for 

c-P3HT and unannealed a-P3HT. Figure 5 shows that the damage depth of all four P3HT samples 

scales linearly with the energy of the monoatomic Ar+ source. The lowest monoatomic source etch 

energy, 0.5 keV, yields a damage depth of approximately 10 nm, while the highest monoatomic 

Ar energy, 4 keV, yields a damage depth of up to 60 nm. The results are comparable within the 

range of error for all four samples. Hence, the damage depth shows little to no dependence on the 

crystallinity of the conjugated polymer. It is important to note that the observed damage depth is 

equal to or deeper than the XPS probing depth (≤ 10 nm) for all monoatomic Ar energies. In other 

words, after exposing P3HT to a monoatomic beam for only 3s even at low energies, all of the 

material contributing to the XPS signal is damaged. 

13 

 
Figure 5. Damage depth of a-P3HT and c-P3HT in dependence on the monoatomic etch energy. 

The damage depth was extracted from the S2p FWHM.  

We now examine the effect  of etching on  a polymer with  a very different  chemical  structure  - 

F8BT. While the damage induced upon etching of P3HT with a monoatomic Ar+ source results 

solely in the increase of the FWHM of the S 2p and C 1s spectra, the damage induced in the S 2p 

peak of F8BT takes a different form. The evolution of the S 2p peak of F8BT (Figure 6a) upon 

cluster  etching  shows  no  significant  changes;  however,  after  very  long  etching  times  a  small 

additional S 2p doublet appears at ~2.5 eV lower in binding energy than the main doublet. After 

etching for 100 nm, this lower peak accounts for 10% of the total S content (Figure S2a and b, SI), 

suggesting  that  cluster  etching  (4  keV)  slightly  damages  the  F8BT.  However,  after  just  3  s  of 

monoatomic etching (3 keV), the original S 2p peak has completely vanished and only the damaged 

S species can be observed (Figure 6b). After again employing GCIB etching, the damaged species 

14 

 
 
is removed and the main S peak reappears. Eventually, the percentage of the damaged S species 

declines to the level of the reference measurement marking the damage depth. The percentage of 

damaged S species is shown in Figure S2a and b in the SI. The main peaks of the other elements 

in F8BT, C and N, appear broadened after monoatomic Ar+ etching, but  do not show any new 

peaks.  

These  results  suggest  that  the  chemical  structure  of  the  polymer  strongly  affects  the  type  and 

degree of damage induced by the monoatomic etching. In the case of P3HT, the thiophene ring is 

more robust to etching damage, while the benzothiadiazole (BT) unit in F8BT is weaker, resulting 

in a higher degree of damage. This is consistent with the bond strength differences between the C-

S  in  thiophene  (713.3  kJ/mol)  and  the  N-S  in  BT  units  (467  kJ/mol)  due  to  dissimilarities  in 

electronegativity.44  This  is  not  only  supported  by  the  spectral  changes,  but  also  by  the 

quantification  of  the  damage  depth,  which  consistently  shows  larger  damage  depths  for  F8BT 

when  compared  to  P3HT.  Since  many  organic  polymers  of  interest  in  organic  photovoltaics 

contain both types of units,45-46 extracting quantitative compositional information from XPS depth 

profiling  of  these  polymers  should  be  performed  with  extreme  care  when  using  monoatomic 

etching.  

Even when the polymers consist of similar chemical building blocks, the exact chemical structure 

may  influence  the  damage  depth.  For  example,  two  high  photovoltaic  performance  conjugated 

polymers  used  in  photovoltaic  devices,  PTB7  and  PCE10,  consist  of  the  same  types  of  S-

containing  chemical  moiety:  thiophene  and  fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene.  In  both  cases,  the 

FWHM of the S 2p peak increases upon etching and was used as the damage indicator. The FWHM 

depth profiles of PTB7 and PCE10 (Figure S2c-f, SI) show that induced damage is consistently 

deeper in PCE10 than in PTB7 regardless of monoatomic ion energy. This is likely to be a result 

15 

 
of the inclusion of the two thiophene rings at the central ring of the benzodithiophene core, instead 

of the alkoxy chains in PCE10. The former can probably be easily cleaved by monoatomic etching 

and result in the deeper observed damage.  

Figure  6c  summarizes  the  damage  depths  of  all  annealed  polymer  films.  A  linear  trend  of 

increasing  damage  depths  with  increasing  monoatomic  etch  energy  is  prominent  for  all  five 

materials. However, the slopes are different. F8BT overall shows a slightly deeper damage than 

the P3HT, reaching over 60 nm upon monoatomic Ar+ etching at 4 keV energy, whereas PTB7 

and PCE10 are less prone to damage with their highest damage depths being around 28 nm and 39 

nm for the same monoatomic ion energy ions (4 keV), respectively. For all investigated materials, 

no significant difference between annealed and unannealed samples was observed (Figure S3, SI), 

reinforcing the previously mentioned independence of damage depth on polymer crystallinity or 

microstructure. This suggest that the type and extend of damage introduced by monoatomic Ar+ 

etching is dependend on the individual molecular structure and electronic properties of the polmers 

rather than on their solid state packing and interchain interactions.

etching.  The  damage  depth  of  F8BT,  PTB7,  and  PCE10  with  respect  to  the  monoatomic  etch 

energy, in addition to the previously shown a-P3HT and c-P3HT, are shown in (c).  

Effect of etching with a monoatomic Ar+ source on the extracted compositional profiles  

The  observed  changes  in  the  spectral  shapes  of  the  elemental  constituents  of  the  polymers  are 

tolerable  in  the  context  of  XPS  depth  profiling  if  they  do  not  affect  the  extracted  atomic 

compositional information obtained by XPS. To investigate the effects of monoatomic Ar+ etching 

on the extracted composition of the polymers, we compare the measured atomic composition to 

that which is expected from the chemical structure of the polymer. Figure 7 shows a depth profile 

of PCE10 focusing on S, O, and F. Not shown is the contribution of C, which makes up the rest of 

the polymer. The cluster reference measurement shows constant values for all elements of PCE10 

throughout the film upon etching, with reasonably good agreement with the theoretical values. We 

note that the surface measurement shows excess O due to surface contamination, which is removed 

with the first etching step. However, all samples that have been subjected to 3 s of monoatomic 

etching show a significant reduction in O and F content in the damaged layers, while the effect on 

S  is  less  pronounced.  Correspondingly,  the  relative  C  content  increases,  complementing  the 

decrease of O and F. These results suggest that bonds containing O and F are particularly prone to 

damage upon  monoatomic  Ar+ bombardment. Similar observations  can be made in  the case of 

PTB7, which also consists of S, O, F and C, just like its derivative PCE10. A strong reduction in 

F and O after monoatomic etching is observed as well (Figure S4c, SI), while the C and S content 

is complementary higher. In the case of F8BT, where the altered peak position indicates that an S-

N bond of the thiadiazole ring must have been damaged, a reduction in N was observed. However, 

the total percentage of damaged and undamaged S is constant throughout the film (Figure S4b, 

SI).  These  observations  illustrate  that  monoatomic  etching  can  preferentially  attack  certain 

18 

 
chemical  bonds,  and  can  therefore  significantly  alter  the  composition  of  polymer  films.  These 

results  suggest  that  bonds  containing  electronegative  atoms  such  as  F,  O  or  N  are  particularly 

susceptible to damage when bombarded with monoatomic Ar+ ions. It is possible that these bonds 

are  cleaved  or  weakened,  such  that  even  upon  etching  with  cluster  argon  source,  they  are 

preferentially removed, leading to a misrepresentation of the original composition of the polymer. 

This  is  of  critical  importance  to  XPS  depth  profiling  in  organic  electronics,  where  accurate 

compositional information is used for the study of materials or interpretation of device properties. 

For example, in the case of depth profiling BHJs of a donor polymer and a small molecule acceptor 

(typically a fullerene), a specific element (commonly not carbon) must be chosen to track each 

component throughout the depth profile. Our results show that the choice of different elements 

within the polymer will strongly influence the obtained compositional profile.

Effect of monoatomic Ar+ etching time  

It is noteworthy that for P3HT, no change in atomic composition is observed upon monoatomic 

etching for 3 s (Figure S4a, SI). This might suggest that some polymers are resilient enough to be 

accurately  studied  by  XPS  depth  profiling  using  monoatomic  etching  sources.  However,  it  is 

important  to  remember that etching  for 3 s is  not  sufficient  to  achieve  any  substantial  material 

removal,  and  longer  etching  times  are  required  for  characterizing  the  bulk  of  materials.  To 

investigate whether the damage induced by monoatomic etching is confined to a certain depth, 

regardless of etching time, we varied the monoatomic etching time from 3 s to 300 s (5 min). As 

before, we then characterized the extent of the damage by removal of the damaged material using 

the GCIB (4 keV), until the measured XPS spectra matched the reference. We chose to investigate 

P3HT as it is the only material that shows unaltered atomic composition for 3 s of monoatomic 

Ar+ etching.  

Figure 8a shows the S 2p FWHM depth profile of an annealed a-P3HT film etched with a 3 keV 

monoatomic beam for varying durations in different spots. The etch depth has been corrected for 

the  material  etched  away  by  the  monoatomic  beam  estimated  via  the  etch  rate  determined  for 

monoatomic etching at 3 keV (0.044 nm/s). The damage depth after 3 s of monoatomic etching is 

comparable to the previous results (Figure 4c and 5), and increases with longer etch times until it 

seemingly saturates after several minutes. For 30 s and longer, the top 100-150 nm of the film is 

heavily  damaged,  with  decreasing damage deeper  in  the  film. However, the FWHM  cannot  be 

restored to the level of the reference measurement within this 300 nm thick film. Therefore, we 

conclude that the after 30 s of monoatomic etching at 3keV the entire film is damaged. Figure 8b 

shows the corresponding compositional depth profile, where no significant changes are present for 

3 and 10 s of etching with a monoatomic Ar+ source. For 30 s and longer, the composition is altered 

21 

 
in the top 100 to 150 nm of the film, corresponding to the heavily damaged region seen in the 

FWHM depth profile. In this region, the S content is heavily reduced by up to 30%, and will result 

in a significant underestimation of P3HT content, if S is used as an indicator for P3HT. We note 

that the etching energy of 3 keV has been chosen as it appears to be very common in literature 

studies that report XPS depth profiling of organic layers.13,15-16,19-21 Repeating the experiment at a 

lower monoatomic etch energy of 1 keV revealed that  longer etch times also lead to deeper damage 

in the form of an increased FWHM and a reduced S content (see SI, Figure S5).  

These results  demonstrate that the  damage  induced by monoatomic etching  accumulates as the 

etching time increases. We note that etching for 30 s is a realistic etch step size for depth profiling 

P3HT, resulting in a depth resolution of 1.3 nm for a 3 keV beam in our case. However, the depth 

profile obtained will simply be an artifact, since the entirety of the polymer film will have been 

damaged during the first step. In the case of the 1 keV beam, the damage depth for a 30 s etch step 

is approximately 35 nm, far higher than the XPS probing depth, rendering the obtained XPS depth 

profiles equally untrustworthy. For both monoatomic ion energies, the damage depth is far larger 

than the estimated penetration depth of Ar ions, again pointing out to propagation of free radicals 

as the most likely cause of damage at the deeper layers. 

We also  note that  prolonged etching with  a monoatomic Ar+ beam  results in  significant  cross-

linking of the polymer. This cross-linking results in a reduction in the etching rate, resulting in an 

increase in the overall etching time required to reach the interface with the ZnO substrate. While 

for short monoatomic etching time of 3 s that resulted in a damage of 40 nm, the overall etching 

time  remained  largely  unchanged  (within  5-10%),  the  etching  time  for  a  film  exposure  to 

monoatomic beam for 300 s has increased by 260%. This significant change in etch rate may result 

in preferential etching when monoatomic etching is applied to a blend of another component with 

22 

 
P3HT, adding uncertainty to the results of XPS depth profiling experiments.   Taking these results 

together suggests that XPS depth profiling using monoatomic etching is unsuitable for application 

on organic conjugated polymers.

monoatomic etching (3 keV) of varying duration. The depth profiles have been corrected for the 

23 

 
 
 
material removed by the monoatomic etching, which amounted to 0.1 to 13 nm depending on the 

mono etch time.  

CONCLUSIONS  

In this work, we studied the effect of argon etching on four different polymers: P3HT (regiorandom 

and  regioregular),  F8BT,  PTB7  and  PCE10  using  monoatomic  and  gas  cluster  beams.  XPS 

measurements show that there are no substantial changes in any film upon argon cluster etching 

(4 keV), whereas only 3 s of monoatomic argon etching on the surface is enough to cause severe 

damage within the polymer films, generally observed as peak broadening or, in the case of sulfur 

in F8BT, as a damaged species. Additionally, the atomic ratios were altered for all polymers except 

P3HT.  We  successfully  employed  cluster  etching  to  remove  the  damaged  layers,  revealing  a 

damage depth of approximately 10 to 60 nm, which varied linearly depending on the ion energy. 

The  damage  depth  was  consistent  for  both  FWHM  and  composition.  It  was  found  to  be 

independent of the film crystallinity, but material specific. Measurements on a-P3HT showed that 

damage accumulates when the mono-etch time is increased to 30 s or longer - even altering the 

previously resistant composition of P3HT up to a depth of 150 nm. This is far beyond the XPS 

probing depth of ≤ 10 nm, meaning that any XPS depth profiles carried out using monoatomic etch 

beams will only measure damaged polymer layers and should be treated with caution. Therefore, 

gas cluster etching is mandatory in order to obtain reliable results - especially when composition 

plays a crucial role.
