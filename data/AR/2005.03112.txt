Abstract

The Jeans stability criterium for gravitational collapse is examined for the case of
an inert binary mixture in local equilibrium, neglectinq dissipative eﬀects. The
corresponding transport equations are established using kinetic theory within the
Euler regime approximation. It is shown that the corresponding dispertion relation
is modiﬁed, yielding corrections to the Jeans wave number that can be generalized
for several interesting cases involving dissipation.

Introduction

Structure formation through gravitational collapse is one of the most important pro-
cesses present in astrophysics. First identiﬁed by James Jeans in 1902 [1], gravity acts
through very long scales allowing density ﬂuctuations to grow exponentially when the
mass present at certain scales surpasses a given mass thresehold. A very simple ar-
gument that leads to a fairly accurate approximation of this threshold consists in the
consideration of the wave equation for the density ﬂuctuations δρ, valid for an isothermal
one-component system with equilibrium density ρ0 [2, 3]:

Now, since the wavelenth of the system is related to the wave number through the
k , a rough estimation of the critical mass needed in order to form a

relation λ = 2π
structure through gravitational collapse in a volume scaled as λ3 reads:

For the case of a molecular cloud ρ0 ∼ 1.6 × 10−19 kg
MJ ∼ 2.1 × 1030kg, which is quite close to the value of a solar mass.

The calculation that leads to Eq. (4) has been generalized by several authors in order
to include dissipative eﬀects such as viscosity and heat conduction for the case of one
component dilute gases [3, 4, 5, 6]. Heat ﬂuxes associated to density gradients (Dufour
eﬀect) have been addressed for the case of a dilute two component plasma [7]. The case
of a binary mixture in the Euler regime has been only partially addressed in phenomeno-
logical approaches and needs to be revised in by means of a kinetic theory formalism
[8, 9].

The purpose of the present paper is to ﬁll this gap giving the kinetic foundations of
the derivation of the dispersion relation for an inert dilute binary gas in the presence
of Newtonian gravity. In order to accomplish this task, the paper has been divided as
follows: section two corresponds to the establishment of the evolution equations of the
averages of the conserved microscopic quantities (mass, linear momentum and energy),
special emphasis is made in the structure of the mass ﬂuxes for each type of particle.
In section 3 the transport equations are linearized so that a suitable dispersion relation
is established identifying the second component in the stability of the system. Finally,
section four is devoted to a discussion of the results here obtained.

2 Balance equations

2.1 Evolution of the distribution function

The starting point of the formalism is the Boltzmann equation for two species in the
presence of Newtonian gravity within the BGK approximation:

∂f[i]

,

i = 1, 2.

(5)

In this work, the notation [.] is used to identify the ith-species and (.) is used to denote
the order of the distribution function with respect to the Kundsen number. In Eq. (5), τ

is the relaxation time to the equilibrium functions f (0)
ﬁelds ga

[i] are expressed in terms of the corresponding scalar potential ϕ[i] given by

[i] and the Newtonian gravitational

∂ϕ[i]

which in turn satisﬁes the Poisson equation:

[i] = −
ga

i = 1, 2.

∇2ϕ[i] = 4πGρ[i],

i = 1, 2.

The total gravitational potential ϕ satisﬁes the equation

∇2ϕ = 4πGρ = 4πG(ϕ[1] + ϕ[2])

Macroscopic variables are identiﬁed with statistical averages, these are given, for species
with number density n[i], by:

The mass balances for each species are obtained multiplying Eqs. (5) by the collision
invariants m[1] and m[2] and upon integration in the respective velocity spaces, yielding:

(13)

In Eq. (13), ρ[i] = m[i]n[i] and use has been made of the deﬁnition of statistical average
(Eq. 9). It is interesting to notice that dissipative contributions may appear in the mass
balance equations through Eq. (11):

To complete the mass balance, we notice that the addition of Eqs. (12) over both species
lead to the mass balance for the mixture:

where the total density of the system is:

obtained considering Eq. (10) and the corresponding averages through the distribution
functions:

3 Linearized transport equations

Eqs. (13), (18) and (23) constitute a set of non-linear partial diﬀerential equations which
can be studied close to local equilibrium in terms of linear perturbations. In this type
of formalism the vector containing the unknown variables x is expressed as the sum of
its equilibrium value x0 and its corresponding ﬂuctuations δx:

x = x0 + δx,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

.

(25)

(26)

Neglecting second order terms, assuming a vanishing center of mass velocity and deﬁning
δθ = ∇ · δ~u, the linearized set of equations is easily obtained by direct substution. The
linearized mass balance reads:

∂
∂t

δρ[i]

4 Dispertion equation and Jeans stability criterium

The linearized transport equations (27-30) can be treated algebraically taking succes-
sively in each equation the Fourier tansform in space and the Laplace transform in time.

Real values for s in the dispertion relation are identiﬁﬁed with exponentially grow-
ing/decaying modes. In the Euler regime, and using the center of mass velocity in the
balance equations (Eq. 10), a very simple dispertion relation is obtained. The resulting
expression reads:

s2[s2 − 4πG(ρ[1] + ρ[2]) + q2(

which reduces, taking ρ0[2] = 0 and ρ0[1] = ρ0, to the Jeans mass for a single component
system Eq. (4).

5 Final Remarks

The use of a representation of the local variables involving the center of mass velocity
allows to establish simple expressions for the dispertion relation (Eq. 34). Indeed, for a
three-component system, the corresponding matrix in the Fourier-Laplace space reads:

Although similar results have been obtained since the pioneeering work of Grishchuk
and Zel’dovich [9], there are quite few works in which kinetic theory has been directly
applied to the analysis of the gravitational instability of dilute mixtures of gases [10]. The
approach here presented leads to remarkably simple expressions for the eigenfrequencies
of the dynamical system and for the critical wave number. This type of representation
for the transport equations motivates further analysis of the Jeans instability involving
difusssion and other dissipative eﬀects in diﬀerent temperature scales. This will be the
subject of future work.
