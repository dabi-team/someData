ABSTRACT

A process of diﬀusion of small-scale magnetic elements inside four active regions
(ARs) was analyzed. Line-of-sight magnetograms acquired by the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) during a
two-day time interval around the AR culmination time were utilized. Small magnetic
elements of size of 3-100 squared HMI pixels with the ﬁeld strength above the detection
threshold of 30 Mx sm−2 were detected and tracked. The turbulent diﬀusion coeﬃcient
was retrieved using the pair-separation technique. Comparison with the previously re-
ported quiet-sun (QS) diﬀusivity was performed. It was found that: i) dispersion of
small-scale magnetic elements inside the AR area occurs in the regime close to normal
diﬀusion, whereas well-pronounced super-diﬀusion is observed in QS; ii) the diﬀusiv-
ity regime operating in an AR (the magnitude of the spectral index and the range of
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient) does not seem to depend on the individual properties of an
AR, such as total unsigned magnetic ﬂux, state of evolution, and ﬂaring activity. We
conclude that small-scale magnetic elements inside an AR do not represent an undis-
turbed photosphere, but they rather are intrinsic part of the whole coherent magnetic
structure forming an active region. Moreover, turbulence of small-scale elements in an
AR is not closely related to processes above the photosphere, but it rather carries the
footprint of the sub-photospheric dynamics.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is widely accepted that the solar magnetic ﬁeld is gener-
ated by a dynamo when the ﬁeld is maintained by plasma
ﬂows within the Sun (Moﬀatt 1978; Parker 1979). Turbulent
nature of the plasma ﬂows involves a treatment of the mag-
netic ﬁeld dispersion in the framework of turbulent diﬀusiv-
ity (Parker 1979). Turbulent diﬀusivity is a key ingredient of
any dynamo theory as a parameter that determines an inter-
play between the plasma ﬂows and the magnetic ﬁeld evo-
lutionary changes on all temporal and spatial scales. Thus,
Kitchatinov (2013) analyzed diﬀerential rotation and merid-
ional ﬂows and concluded that the dynamo number is in in-
verse proportion to the turbulent diﬀusivity, and that high
temperature stars should have higher values of turbulent
diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Nelson and co-authors (Nelson et al.
2013), based on 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simula-
tions of convection and dynamo action in solar-type stars,
concluded that reducing of the turbulent diﬀusivity coeﬃ-
cient in the models leads to appearance of a cyclic reversal

and an increase of the Reynolds number. The latter implies
an enhanced level of turbulence and an increase of inter-
mittency in the global toroidal magnetic wreaths in both
hemispheres of a star, which facilitates formation of buoy-
ant loops at various depths in the convective zone, i.e., the
turbulent-induced magnetic buoyancy.

Variations of the turbulent diﬀusion coeﬃcient (fre-
quently noted as ηt ) with depth is, to some extent, a free pa-
rameter of a model. For example, in ﬂux transport dynamo
models (Dikpati & Charbonneau 1999; Dikpati & Gilman
2006) the coeﬃcient is adopted to be decreasing with depth
s−1
on the surface and down to
from approximately 200 km
in the bulk of the CZ below 0.9 R⊙.
approximately 5 km
To the contrary, in the mean ﬁeld solar dynamo model with
a double-cell meridional circulation (Pipin & Kosovichev
2011) the magnitude of ηt ﬁrst increases from the surface
to the depth of about 0.85 R⊙, while the decrease is gradu-
ally set on depths below 0.8 R⊙.

In the majority of the existing dynamo models, the
turbulent diﬀusivity coeﬃcient ηt is treated as a constant
parameter over the solar surface and over all spatial and
temporal scales. An exception is the theoretical and nu-

merical approach suggested by Brandenburg and colleagues
(Brandendurg et al. 2008). They deﬁned a more general
scale-dependent version of the transport coeﬃcient: the tur-
bulent magnetic diﬀusivity for the mean magnetic ﬁelds de-
creases monotonously with the increasing wavenumber (in
other words, with decreasing spatial scales). Such varia-
tions of ηt with scales imply the turbulent regime of super-
diﬀusivity, which was discovered recently in observations
of the quiet sun magnetic ﬁelds (Abramenko et al. 2011;
Lepreti et al.
2013, 2014a,b;
Keys et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2015; Jafarzadeh et al. 2017;
Abramenko 2017).

2012; Giannattasio et al.

Moreover, observed data showed that the regime itself
varies with scales. In particular, super-diﬀusivity is very
strong and well pronounced on smallest observable scales
(γ = 1.5 on scales 30-400 km), it is very low and grow-
ing from ∼ 20 to ∼150 km2s−1
as spatial scales increase
(Abramenko et al. 2011; Lepreti et al. 2012), and it be-
comes moderate on scales of 500-6000 km with γ ≈ 1.3 and
the magnitude of the turbulent diﬀusion coeﬃcient of 100-
300 km2s−1
(Abramenko 2017). It was also shown that the
super-diﬀusion regimes operating in both weakest (a coro-
nal hole, CH) and in moderate quiet-sun (super-granulation,
SG) magnetic environments are quite similar (Abramenko
2017). This allows us to suggest that a unique mechanism
generates and transports the small-scale magnetic ﬁeld in-
side vast solar areas outside active regions (ARs).

Nevertheless, still remains open the question as to how
does the dispersion of small magnetic elements inside ARs
occur? In case these small elements are a part of the undis-
turbed photosphere, they should display the quiet-sun super-
diﬀusion characteristics. If, however, the small-scale ﬁelds in
an AR including the granulation ﬁeld outside plage regions
are part of the AR magnetic environment, then the diﬀusiv-
ity characteristics may diﬀer. If the diﬀusivity characteris-
tics are indeed diﬀerent, then properties of small-scale ﬁeld
dispersion and transport may be inﬂuenced and carry some
footprint of sub-photospheric turbulent diﬀusion existing at
depths from where the AR magnetic ﬁelds began to rise.

The aim of the present study is to measure mag-
netic diﬀusivity of small magnetic elements inside ARs and
to compare the results with those obtained previously for
the undisturbed photosphere (Giannattasio et al. 2014a,b;
Abramenko 2017).

2 DATA AND METHOD

We utilized line-of-sight magnetograms (hmi.M-720s series)
acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
onboard Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). The magne-
tograms were taken in the FeI 6173.3 A spectral line with
the spatial resolution of 1 arcsec (pixel size of 0.5 arcsec), ca-
dence of 12 min (Schou et al. 2012) and noise level of about
6 Mx sm−2

(Liu et al. 2012).

Four ARs were selected for the analysis, Figure 1. Two
of them (NOAA AR 11158 and 12085) were observed dur-
ing their emergence and the other two ARs were rather sta-
ble. Similarly to the technique used in Abramenko (2017),
for each AR we prepared a two-day data set of 240 mag-
netograms each, centered on the moment of the AR cul-
mination. The AR details as well the calculated parame-

ters, are listed in Table 1. Flare index, FI, of an AR (col-
umn 6) was calculated using GOES data and the approach
suggested in Abramenko (2005), where FI=1 (100) corre-
sponds to a speciﬁc ﬂare productivity of one C1.0 (X1.0)
ﬂare per day (FI data starting from 2003 can be found at
http://solar.dev.argh.team/sunspots). In the same column
6, we also indicate the strongest ﬂare that occured in an AR
during its passage across the solar disk.

Since we intend to compare the diﬀusion regime in
ARs with that in the undisturbed photosphere, we follow
the same detection and tracking routine that was applied
to the quiet-sun (QS) areas and described in details in
Abramenko et al. (2011); Lepreti et al. (2012); Abramenko
(2017).The thresholding technique was applied there to the
modulus of the magnetic ﬁeld strength to select magnetic
ﬂux concentrations with size from 3 to 100 squared pixels.
In QS-areas, threshold of 20 Mx sm−2
was used to outline
a suﬃciently large number of elements with ﬁeld strengths
that exceeded triple standard deviation (6 Mx sm−2
). How-
ever, when considering AR areas, we found only few cases
in a magnetogram that satisfy the above requirements. To
detect a suﬃcient number of small-scale elements (at least
100 per magnetogram) of size 3-100 squared pixels, we were
forced to increase the threshold level to 30 Mx sm−2
. This
experiment indicates that the overall magnetic ﬂux density
on small scales inside ARs is higher than that in QS-areas.
This inference will be further conﬁrmed below by an analysis
of magnetic power spectra.

About one thousand magnetic elements for each AR
were detected and tracked (see last column in Table 1).
Note that elongated chains of several local maxima above
the threshold level were not considered. By tracking the
selected elements we ﬁrst generated their trajectories that
were then used to derive the displacement spectra. The
spectra were calculated using the pair-separation technique
(Monin & Yaglom 1975; Lepreti et al. 2012), when dis-
placements are computed as an increment in the distance
between two tracers at consecutive moments (see Eq.2 in
Abramenko (2017)). As compared to the traditional single-
particle displacement spectrum, the two-particle dispersion
reﬂects diﬀusivity properties arising from the inertial range
of turbulence, thus allowing us to avoid possible inﬂuence
of large-scale velocity patterns. The displacement spectrum,
h(∆l)2(τi)i, as a function of the time interval τ is shown in
Figure 2 for all ARs. The sample interval, τi, is measured
from the ﬁrst appearance of both tracers in the pair, and
the displacements for a given τi are then averaged over all
pairs.

A linear range between 720 s and 14400 s (12 min - 4
h) is well pronounced in all spectra shown in Figure 2. In-
side this interval we calculated the best linear ﬁt, and the
corresponding slope of the ﬁt or spectral index, γ, is shown
in the 8th column of Table 1. The spectral index and the
y-intercept of the ﬁt allowed us to compute the turbulent
diﬀusion coeﬃcients, K(τ), and K(∆l) by using Eqs. 6-7 in
Abramenko (2017). (Hereinafter, the turbulent diﬀusion co-
eﬃcients is denoted as K.)

3 RESULTS

The calculated turbulent diﬀusion coeﬃcients are shown in
Figure 3 as a function of temporal and spatial scales. In both
graphs the K plots are stacked on top of each other along
the vertical axis, however, no correlation with the general
AR parameters is observed. Indeed, the spectra of the two
emerging ARs (NOAA 11158 and 12085) do not appear dis-
tinct and they are similar to the spectra of the stable ARs
(NOAA 11263 and 12494), while the spectra of two the most
ﬂare-productive ARs (NOAA 11156 and 11263) are nested
in between the spectra of the low-ﬂaring ARs (NOAA 12085
and 12494) and show no speciﬁc features.

At the same time, there exists a well-pronounced dif-
ference between the quiet Sun and active regions diﬀusiv-
ity. Data for a coronal hole were adopted from Abramenko
(2017) and overplotted in Figure 3 for comparison with a
thick turquoise line. We thus note weaker super-diﬀusivity
in ARs. The increase of K with scales is slower in ARs than in
the QS-area. The spectral index γ varies from 1.02 to 1.17 in
the ARs, whereas in the QS-areas γ = 1.3 was reported by
Abramenko (2017). (Note, that super-granulation exhibits
the same turbulent diﬀusion regime as the CH (Abramenko
2017)). Therefore, the dispersion of small-scale magnetic el-
ements in AR, being closer to the normal diﬀusions, notably
diﬀers from that in the quiet Sun.

The high degree of super-diﬀusivity implies presence of
high degree of intermittency with frequent large ﬂuctuations
(Levy ﬂights) and an eﬃcient search strategy of chaotic dis-
placements (Klafter & Sokolov 2005), whereas normal diﬀu-
sion implies a non-correlated random walk with very rare
large ﬂuctuations. Small elements inside an AR are a sub-
ject of continuous strong buﬀeting by neighbouring large
magnetic elements and ﬂows, and this might be the rea-
son for non-correlated displacements. This speciﬁc (diﬀerent
from QS) turbulent regime of small-scale elements in ARs
suggests that they are an intrinsic part of the entire mag-
netic structure of an AR and, as such, they might belong
to a turbulent cascade of an AR. To explore this sugges-
tion, we calculated magnetic power spectra using AR mag-
netograms and QS-area data analysed in Abramenko (2017).
The power spectra were computed using the method pre-
sented in Abramenko (2005).

A typical AR magnetic power spectrum overplotted
with power spectra of CH and SG areas is shown in Figure 4.
Note, that according to Abramenko (2005), the cutoﬀ of the
magnetic power spectrum as determined from SOHO/MDI
data occurs at scales of about 3 Mm, while this plot shows
that in the case of SDO/HMI data the cutoﬀ scale is at about
2.5 Mm. This HMI cutoﬀ scale is now inside the interval of
our present analysis (vertical dotted lines in Figure 4). The
instrumentation cutoﬀ distorts the spectrum. Nevertheless,
one can conclude that magnetic energy on small scales is
systematically higher in AR than in QS, and small-scale
elements in QS and in ARs belong to diﬀerent turbulent
cascades.

in ARs is still an open question. Here we explored magnetic
ﬂux dispersion by using SDO/HMI magnetograms for four
ARs obtained at diﬀerent stage of evolution and diﬀerent
ﬂare productivity, and compared the results with the dis-
persion properties measured for quiet Sun areas. We report
the following.

- The dispersion process of small-scale magnetic ele-
ments inside AR diﬀers from that of the undisturbed photo-
sphere. The regime of turbulent diﬀusion in ARs on scales
of 500-4000 km is close to the normal diﬀusion whereas in
the quiet Sun super-diﬀusivity with γ = (1.3 - 1.4) is well
pronounced (Giannattasio et al. 2014a; Abramenko 2017).
We found the magnitude of γ varying in ARs in the range of
1.02-1.17. The turbulent diﬀusion coeﬃcient, K, was found
in the most “normal-diﬀusion“ AR
to be 120-130 km
s−1
12085 (γ = 1.02), and it is in the range of 145-240 km
for the most “super-diﬀusive“ AR 12494 (γ = 1.17).

- The diﬀusivity regime as determined from the mag-
nitude of γ and the range of K, does not appear to depend
on individual properties of an AR, such as total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux, state of evolution, and ﬂaring activity.

- Analyzed magnetic power spectra show that small-
scale element in an AR may belong to the classical Kol-
mogorov’s turbulent cascade with the spectral index close
to -5/3. At the same time, magnetic power spectra for QS
areas are shallower with the spectral index about -1. The
less steep spectra of CH and SG indicate that in quiet sun
the ratio between small scale and large scale energy is higher
with respect to what is found in ARs.

These conclusions allow us to further suggest that:
i) Small-scale magnetic elements inside the AR area are
not representative of the undisturbed photosphere, but they
rather intrinsically belong to the whole coherent magnetic
structure of an AR and probably are a result of the evo-
lutionary processes in an AR such as ﬂux emergence and
dispersion .

ii) Turbulent properties of small-scale elements in an
AR are not deﬁned by processes above the photosphere, but
they rather carry the footprint of the sub-photospheric dy-
namics. In this case analyzing turbulence inside ARs, we
have a chance to probe deep layers of the convection zone.
As it follows from Figure 3, the magnitude of K at small-
est observable scales is higher in ARs than in QS-areas and
in ARs it decreases slower with decreasing spatial scale as
compared to QS-areas. The QS turbulence is a near-surface
phenomenon. If the AR turbulence regime indeed carries a
footprint of the deep-layer dynamics, then we may further
speculate that the coeﬃcient of turbulent diﬀusivity should
increase with depth, which is in agreement with the model-
ing approach presented in Pipin & Kosovichev (2011). Fur-
ther analysis based on larger statistics might allow us to
estimate the depth at which an ARs are rooted in the con-
vection zone, which is an important ingredient of various
dynamo models (e.g., Nelson et al. 2013).
