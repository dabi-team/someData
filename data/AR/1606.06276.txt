Abstract –We report direct experimental evidence of interspecies ion separation in direct-drive,
inertial-conﬁnement-fusion experiments on the OMEGA laser facility. These experiments, which
used plastic capsules with D2/Ar gas ﬁll (1% Ar by atom), were designed speciﬁcally to reveal
interspecies ion separation by exploiting the predicted, strong ion thermo-diﬀusion between ion
species of large mass and charge diﬀerence. Via detailed analyses of imaging x-ray-spectroscopy
data, we extract Ar-atom-fraction radial proﬁles at diﬀerent times, and observe both enhancement
and depletion compared to the initial 1%-Ar gas ﬁll. The experimental results are interpreted with
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations that include recently implemented, ﬁrst-principles models of
interspecies ion diﬀusion. The experimentally inferred Ar-atom-fraction proﬁles agree reasonably,
but not exactly, with calculated proﬁles associated with the incoming and rebounding ﬁrst shock.

Interspecies ion separation has been proposed as a po-
tential fusion-yield degradation mechanism in inertial-
conﬁnement-fusion (ICF) implosions [1–3]. Several ICF
experimental campaigns [4–11] have reported yield or
yield-ratio anomalies where interspecies ion separation
within the hot spot is a possible explanation. Meanwhile,
ﬁrst-principles analytic theories for multi-ion-species dif-
fusion [1, 2, 12–16] have been developed, some of which
have been implemented into ICF implosion codes [17, 18],
enabling us to quantitatively assess the magnitude of in-
terspecies ion separation and yield degradation in ICF
implosions.
In addition, ion-Fokker-Planck [19, 20] and
particle-in-cell kinetic simulations [3,21,22] are being used
to address this problem, and are particularly appropriate
for more-kinetic scenarios, e.g., exploding pushers, hot-
spot formation in ignition capsules, hohlraum plasmas, or
near steep gradients at shock fronts and material inter-
faces. We do not address the question here of whether
interspecies ion separation substantially aﬀects the yield
in ignition-class implosions on the National Ignition Facil-
ity [23], but point out that this and related work will help
establish a validated capability to answer the question in
a quantitative manner.

The purpose of this work is to complement and expand

upon prior ICF experimental campaigns that relied on
yield or yield-ratio anomalies as evidence for species sepa-
ration. Here, based on direct-drive ICF implosions on the
OMEGA laser facility [24], we provide direct, spatially re-
solved experimental evidence of interspecies ion separation
via detailed analyses of imaging x-ray-spectroscopy data,
which are less sensitive to other potential causes of yield
degradation in an ICF implosion.
In this work: (1) we
exploit recently developed analytic theory [14, 15] of in-
terspecies ion diﬀusion to design an ICF implosion that
maximizes interspecies ion diﬀusion, such that it is ob-
servable via x-ray diagnostics; (2) rather than focusing on
separation between fuel species, e.g., D/3He or D/T, we
use D and a trace amount of Ar, where both the choice of
Ar itself and its pre-ﬁll concentration are chosen to max-
imize the expected interspecies diﬀusion coeﬃcient; and
(3) we aim for a more-collisional implosion so that inter-
pretations using the recently formulated interspecies-ion-
diﬀusion theories are appropriate. The main results in this
Letter are the ﬁrst direct identiﬁcation of interspecies ion
separation in an ICF implosion based on the analyses of
spatially resolved x-ray-spectroscopy data, observation of
spatially non-uniform Ar-concentration enhancement and
depletion (compared to the spatially uniform 1 atom% Ar

We brieﬂy discuss the theory that guided these experi-
ments. The diﬀusive mass ﬂux of the lighter ions relative
to the center of mass in a plasma with two ion species
can be written as [14, 15] ~i = −ρD[∇c + kp∇ log pi +
(ekE/Ti)∇Φ + k(i)
T ∇ log Te], where ρ is the
total mass density, D the classical diﬀusion coeﬃcient,
c ≡ ρl/ρ the lighter-ion mass concentration, pi the ion
pressure, Ti and Te the ion and electron temperatures, re-
spectively, Φ the electric potential, and kp, kE, k(i)
T , k(e)
the diﬀusion ratios for baro-diﬀusion, electro-diﬀusion,
ion thermo-diﬀusion, and electron thermo-diﬀusion, re-
spectively; ~i can also be written in terms of molar-
concentration gradients [16]. Because the theory predicts
larger diﬀusion ratios for ion species with a large mass
and charge diﬀerence [15], we focused on a D/Ar mix-
ture (rather than D/3He or D/T). We chose Ar in par-
ticular because of its proven usefulness as an x-ray spec-
troscopic tracer in ICF implosions [25–31]. We evalu-
ated the diﬀusion ratios [15] for a D/Ar mixture versus
c [ﬁg. 1(a)]; k(i)
is the largest ratio and maximizes at
T
c = ρD/(ρD + ρAr) ≈ 0.84, corresponding to Ar number
fraction fAr ≡ nAr/(nAr + nD) ≈ (1 − c)/(1 + 19c) ≈ 1%.
Thus, we focused our attention on an implosion design
with large ∇Ti and fAr ≈ 1% to maximize ion thermo-
diﬀusion. Furthermore, we wanted relatively high Ti and
D while keeping the Ar–D mean free path much smaller
than the hot-spot size for most of the implosion. Al-
though the theory [14–16] is not strictly correct within a
shock front, it should nevertheless capture the qualitative,
leading-order eﬀects on interspecies ion separation during
the passage and rebound of the ﬁrst incoming shock.

We performed 1D HYDRA [32] simulations of direct-
drive OMEGA implosions with a 1-ns square pulse to ar-
rive at the capsule designs in ﬁg. 1(b). Table 1 summa-
rizes the as-shot laser and target parameters and neutron-

based measurements. To evaluate the amount of ex-
pected species separation, we also performed pre-shot 1D
simulations using xRAGE [17] with its recently imple-
mented two-ion-species transport model [16]. All our pre-
shot xRAGE results showed relative deviations in fAr of
≥ 20%, in some cases much larger, from the initial values
(fAr = 0.01 or 0.001) over much of the implosion, giving
us conﬁdence that we could resolve the species separation
based on error bars achieved in previous analyses of imag-
ing x-ray-spectroscopy data.

The primary diagnostics

two x-ray multi-
monochromatic imagers (MMI) [33] with quasi-orthogonal
views (mounted on TIMs 3 and 4, where TIM stands for a
“ten-inch manipulator” diagnostic port), a streaked x-ray
spectrometer (TIM 1), and a time- and space-integrated,
absolutely calibrated x-ray spectrometer (TIM 2). Stan-
dard neutron diagnostics and full-aperture backscatter
systems were also ﬁelded. The MMIs used 10-µm-diameter
pinholes, setting the spatial resolution at & 10 µm, and
recorded data on x-ray framing cameras between 3.3–
5.5 keV around the time of ﬁrst-shock convergence. Each
camera recorded four frames per shot at diﬀerent times;
frame trigger times are given in the ﬁgure captions. We ob-
tained analyzable MMI data for several shots with initial
fAr ≈ 1% (table 1), and used the Ar-Heβ (3.68 keV), Lyβ
(3.94 keV), and Lyγ (4.15 keV) lines in our spectroscopic
analyses. Shots with initial fAr ≈ 0.1%, predicted to have
much reduced ion thermo-diﬀusion, provided weaker spec-
tral lines.

The key objective and result of this work is the exper-
imental inference of fAr versus radius r. Deviation from
the spatially uniform target-pre-ﬁll value constitutes proof
of interspecies ion separation. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate
the key steps of the MMI data processing and analyses
required to arrive at fAr(r). MMI data processing to ob-
tain narrow-band images [ﬁg. 2(b)] is based on the method
of refs. 29, 31, and 34. Extraction of electron density ne
and temperature Te versus r are based on the emissivity-
analysis method of ref. 28. Figure 2(a) shows one frame
of MMI data after it has been converted from ﬁlm den-
sity to intensity (arbitrary units). The photon-energy
dependence of the MMI data is corrected using streaked
and absolutely calibrated spectral data [35]. Figure 2(b)
shows the narrow-band images constructed from the data
in ﬁg. 2(a), and ﬁg. 2(c) shows the space-integrated spec-
trum from ﬁg. 2(a) before continuum subtraction.

The next step is to extract ne and Te radial proﬁles.
Abel inversion is applied to each narrow-band image, e.g.,
ﬁg. 2(b), giving argon emissivity (with continuum sub-
tracted) versus r for four radial zones of approximately
10-µm width (set by both the size of MMI pinholes and
spectral signal-to-noise considerations for each zone), at
the time of the particular MMI frame. The time is approx-
imately known based on the experimental trigger time of
each frame of the x-ray framing camera, but due to cable
delays and the ﬁnite time of the sweep across the camera’s
photocathode strips, we regard the quoted times as hav-

sivity proﬁles are analyzed to provide ne and Te versus
r [ﬁg. 3(a)] based on comparisons with detailed atomic-
physics models. The underlying atomic database was gen-
erated via the fully relativistic path in the Los Alamos
suite of codes RATS, ACE, and GIPPER [36,37], followed
by the collisional-radiative code ATOMIC [37–39]. The
resulting NLTE (non-local thermal equilibrium) spectral
data were used in the intensity and emissivity analyses of
the MMI data [ﬁgs. 3, 4(a), and 4(b)], as well as in the
forward modeling of space-resolved spectra and narrow-
band images by the FESTR spectral post-processing code
[40,41]. Error bars for Te are obtained based on the greater
of the Te resolution (100 eV) in the atomic database men-
tioned above or the standard deviation of Te (e.g., average

of 63 eV for the four radial zones for shot 78199, TIM 3,
frame 2) as determined from the theoretical emissivity ra-
tio of Lyβ/Heβ at four diﬀerent values of ne (5 × 1023,
8 × 1023, 1 × 1024, and 2 × 1024 cm−3) in our regime
of interest. Error bars for ne are obtained based on the
greater of the uncertainties in the Te (100 eV) and ne reso-
lutions (1–2 × 1023 cm−3, depending on the density) in the
database, or the standard deviation in ne (e.g., average of
1.1 × 1023 cm−3 for the four radial zones for shot 78199,
TIM 3, frame 2) from assuming slightly higher and lower
values of ne in the central zone (e.g., 4 ± 1 × 1023 cm−3
for shot 78199, TIM 3, frame 2), which is derived from
the line broadening of each of the three Ar lines from the
space-integrated spectrum.

The argon density nAr is determined using nAr =
nu/Fu(Te, ne), where nu and Fu are the upper-level num-
ber densities and fractional populations, respectively, of
the particular line transition being used [42]. Fu(Te, ne)
is retrieved from the atomic database based on the previ-
ously determined ne(r) and Te(r). Since the spectral lines
are suﬃciently optically thin [28], nu (arbitrary units) is
extracted based on its proportionality to the correspond-
ing observed line intensities, which are obtained from the
space-resolved spectra extracted from annular regions of

the implosion-core image by numerically integrating the
area under the line after continuum subtraction. Finally,
the known pre-ﬁll amount of Ar closes the system of lin-
ear equations relating nu(r) to nAr(r) [42]. Error bars for
nAr are from propagation of uncertainties in nu (e.g., 9%,
6%, 7%, and 8% from the innermost to outermost radial
zone for shot 78199, TIM 3, frame 2) and Fu(Te, ne) (e.g.,
25%, 22%, 20%, and 54% from the innermost to outer-
most radial zone for shot 78199, TIM 3, frame 2). The
deuterium density nD is inferred from quasi-neutrality
ne = ZDnD + ZArnAr, and ﬁnally fAr ≡ nAr/(nAr + nD).
Error bars for nD and fAr use the propagated errors from
ne and nAr, and nAr and nD, respectively. Figure 3 shows
an example of ne, Te, nAr, and nD versus r, and ﬁgs. 4(a)
and 4(b) show fAr(r) from diﬀerent shots and MMI views
and times. Results shown are the averages from the Ar-
Heβ, Lyβ, and Lyγ lines. The non-uniform spatial proﬁles
of fAr and their deviation from the initial pre-ﬁll value
from several diﬀerent shots and times constitute proof of
interspecies ion separation between the D and Ar, which
is the main result of this Letter.

To build conﬁdence in our conclusions, we apply the
same analysis procedure to synthetic Ar-Heβ, Lyβ, and
Lyγ images and space-resolved spectra. The synthetic
data are generated using the FESTR code [41], using the
data in ﬁg. 3 and assuming 1D spherical symmetry, for
two cases: (i) nAr as shown in ﬁg. 3(b) and (ii) spatially
uniform fAr = 0.01 with equal nD + nAr as in (i). In both
cases, we extract fAr(r) in good agreement with the fAr(r)
in the synthetic data. This demonstrates that our analysis
accurately extracts fAr(r) and is also able to distinguish
between species separation versus no species separation.

We also note some limitations of our analysis. Firstly,
our analysis assumes 1D spherical symmetry, introducing
possible errors if the implosion has signiﬁcant 2D and/or
3D structure. While our implosions appear fairly round,
and quasi-orthogonal MMI views at similar times yield
similar results [e.g., shot 78197, blue and orange curves in
ﬁg. 4(b)], small-scale non-uniformities are clearly visible
[e.g., ﬁg. 2(b)]. We assessed the eﬀect of non-uniformities
for shot 78199 (TIM 3, frame 2) by dividing the narrow-
band images of ﬁg. 2(b) into three wedges of 120◦ each
and doing independent analysis on each wedge to obtain
ne and Te proﬁles; the standard deviations of ne(r) and
Te(r) across the three wedges are similar to the error bars
already considered (as shown in ﬁg. 3) and thus would
not substantially increase the ﬁnal error bars shown in
ﬁg. 4. Future work should employ both 2D [31] and 3D
[43] reconstruction techniques to further assess both 2D
and 3D eﬀects on our analysis. Secondly, unaccounted-for
CH shell mix into the hot spot aﬀects the species balance
in the quasi-neutrality condition used in our analysis by
causing overestimates of the inferred nD, which aﬀects the
inferred fAr. However, we have estimated that the local
CH fraction in the hot spot must exceed an unrealistically
large value ∼ 10% before it could aﬀect our conclusion of
D/Ar separation presented in ﬁgs. 4(a) and 4(b). Finally,

Fig. 4: Argon number fraction fAr versus r for (a) shot 78199
(red ≈ 1.10 ns = 84% of BT, blue ≈ 1.14 ns = 87% of BT),
(b) shots 78197 and 78201 (blue ≈ 1.08 ns = 82% of BT, orange
≈ 1.09 ns = 83% of BT, red ≈ 1.18 ns = 87% of BT), and
(c) 1D post-shot xRAGE simulation (shot 78199) including a
two-ion-species transport model [16].

our use of the known initial amount of Ar in the fuel region
to infer absolute nAr from nu (arbitrary units) means that
nAr is overestimated if Ar leaks into the shell. The latter
could be a possible explanation for why fAr(r) < 1% ev-
erywhere for shot 78197 [ﬁg. 4(b)], keeping in mind that
fAr(r) is extracted only from regions with visible, analyz-
able Ar spectral emission. Resolution of the shell/gas-mix
issues requires further work, including the use of N -species
ion-diﬀusion models that can model both the D/Ar sepa-
ration and gas/shell mix.

Next, we interpret our results via a post-shot, 1D sim-
ulation of shot 78199 using xRAGE [17] with a two-ion-
species transport model [16]. Figure 4(c) shows fAr(r)
for shot 78199, revealing that fAr is reduced ahead of
the incoming ﬁrst shock and enhanced behind it [green
and red curves of ﬁg. 4(c)]. After shock reﬂection (at
≈ 1.18 ns and ≈ 87% of neutron bang time in the simu-
lation), fAr is enhanced throughout much of the hot spot

p-4

Observation of interspecies ion separation in inertial-conﬁnement-fusion implosions

(up to ≈ 20 µm) through neutron bang time [blue curve of
ﬁg. 4(c)]. Furthermore, when ion thermo-diﬀusion, which
is the strongest expected contributor to interspecies sepa-
ration between D and Ar, is turned oﬀ in the calculation,
the fAr enhancement and depletion largely disappear. In-
dependently, these eﬀects are also seen in post-shot sim-
ulations from another radiation-hydrodynamics code, to
which a multi-ion-species diﬀusion model has been added
[44] and recently updated to include ion thermo-diﬀusion
[15, 45–47]. Additional detailed comparisons between our
data and simulation results from both codes will be re-
ported elsewhere. While detailed validation is beyond the
scope of this work, note that there is reasonable agree-
ment between the data and two key aspects of the post-
shot simulation of shot 78199: (1) the peak magnitude
of fAr (≈ 1.5%), i.e., compare maxima of blue curves in
ﬁgs. 4(a) and 4(c), and (2) the qualitative evolution of
fAr, in that fAr is below 1% nearer the origin at an ear-
lier time [red curves of ﬁgs. 4(a) and 4(c)] and above 1%
nearer the origin at a later time [blue curves of ﬁgs. 4(a)
and 4(c)]. Diﬀerences in the details of the fAr-proﬁle evo-
lution between the observations and xRAGE simulation
could arise because (1) there could be more D enhance-
ment ahead of the shock front than the xRAGE prediction
due to kinetic eﬀects near the shock front, and (2) shell
mix, which aﬀects fAr through an altered species balance
in the quasi-neutrality condition, is not included in the
xRAGE simulation.

Additional evidence supports our identiﬁcation of inter-
species ion separation. The FESTR code [41] is used to
ﬁnd the best spectral ﬁt to radially resolved Ar spectral
data. In all cases examined, when fAr is allowed to be a
free parameter in the ﬁtting instead of being ﬁxed at the
initial pre-ﬁll value of 1%, the ﬁt is improved, e.g., 36%
improvement in normalized χ2 for the third radial zone
(corresponding to r ≈ 30 µm) of the data in ﬁg. 2.

In conclusion, we have reported direct experimental ev-
idence for interspecies ion separation in an ICF implosion,
via detailed analyses of imaging x-ray-spectroscopy data.
These direct-drive OMEGA implosions of plastic capsules
with D2/Ar gas ﬁll were designed to maximize interspecies
ion thermo-diﬀusion between ion species of large mass and
charge diﬀerence. This campaign beneﬁtted from pre- and
post-shot radiation-hydrodynamic simulations including a
ﬁrst-principles treatment of interspecies ion diﬀusion. The
simulations show that fAr is enhanced and depleted, re-
spectively, in front of and behind the ﬁrst incoming shock,
with fAr enhancement persisting at the center from ﬁrst-
shock convergence through neutron bang time. Our data
agree reasonably well with the calculated eﬀects on fAr(r)
due to the incoming and rebounding ﬁrst shock, but more
detailed validation, which is beyond the scope of this work,
is needed. The experimental Ar K-shell spectral signatures
are overtaken by bremsstrahlung continuum by the time of
neutron bang time (around the time of peak compression),
and thus we are unable to report whether interspecies sep-
aration is observed through bang time. Nevertheless, this

ﬁrst result using x-ray spectroscopy to detect interspecies
ion separation encourages further work toward establish-
ing a validated capability to address its role in yield degra-
dation of ignition-scale ICF implosions.

[35] The MMI data is corrected as follows. First, the streaked
x-ray-spectroscopy data (SSCA) is corrected by matching
the time-integrated SSCA data to the space- and time-
integrated, absolutely calibrated x-ray-spectroscopy data
(XRS2). Then the space-integrated MMI spectrum is cor-
rected to match the corrected SSCA data at the time of
