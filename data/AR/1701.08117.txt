Abstract

Monte Carlo simulations using MCNP6.1 were performed to study the eﬀect of

neutron activation in Ar/CO2 neutron detector counting gas. A general MCNP

model was built and validated with simple analytical calculations. Simulations

and calculations agree that only the 40Ar activation can have a considerable

eﬀect. It was shown that neither the prompt gamma intensity from the 40Ar

neutron capture nor the produced 41Ar activity have an impact in terms of

gamma dose rate around the detector and background level.

1. Introduction

Ar/CO2 is a widely applied detector counting gas, with long history in ra-

diation detection. Nowadays, the application of Ar/CO2-ﬁlled detectors is ex-

tended in the ﬁeld of neutron detection as well. However, the exposure of

Ar/CO2 counting gas to neutron radiation carries the risk of neutron activa-

tion. Therefore, detailed consideration of the eﬀect and amount of neutron

induced radiation in the Ar/CO2 counting gas is a key issue, especially for large

volume detectors.

In this paper methodology and results of detailed analytical calculations

and Monte Carlo simulations of prompt and decay gamma production in boron-

carbide-based neutron detectors ﬁlled with Ar/CO2 counting gas are presented

(see Appendix).

In Section 2 a detailed calculations method for prompt gamma and activity

production and signal-to-background ratio is introduced, as well as a model

built in MCNP6.1 for the same purposes. The collected bibliographical data

(cross section, decay constant) and the cross section libraries used for MCNP6.1

simulation are also presented.

In Section 3 the results of the analytical calculations and the simulation,

their comparison and their detailed analysis are given.

In Section 4 the obtained results are concluded from the aspects of gamma

emission during and after irradiation, radioactive waste production and emis-

sion, and the eﬀect of self-induced gamma background on the measured signal.

2. Context

The European Spallation Source (ESS) has the goal to be the world’s leading neu-

tron source for the study of materials by the second quarter of this century [1; 2].

Large scale material-testing instruments, beyond the limits of the current state-

of-the-art instruments are going to be served by the brightest neutron source in

the world, delivering 5 MW power on target. At the same time the 3He crisis

instigates detector scientists to open a new frontier for potential 3He substitute

technologies and adapt them to the requirements of the large scale instruments

that used to be fulﬁlled by well-tested 3He detectors. One of the most promising

replacements is the 10B converter based gaseous detector technology, utilising

an Ar/CO2 counting gas. Ar/CO2-ﬁlled detectors will be utilised among others

for inelastic neutron spectrometers [3–6], where on the one hand, very large de-

tector volumes are foreseen, on the other hand, very low background radiation

2

is required. Consequently, due to the high incoming neutron intensity and large

detector volumes, the eﬀects of neutron-induced reactions, especially neutron

activation in the solid body or in the counting gas of the detector could scale

up and become relevant, both in terms of background radiation and radiation

safety.

Gaseous detectors. The gaseous ionisation chamber is one of the most common

radiation detectors. The ionisation chamber itself is a gas ﬁlled tank that con-

tains two electrodes with DC voltage [7; 8]. The detection method is based on

the collision between atoms of the ﬁlling gas and the photons or charged parti-

cles to detect, during which electrons and positively charged ions are produced.

Due to the electric ﬁeld between the electrodes, the electrons drift to the an-

ode, inducing a measurable signal. However, this measurable signal is very low,

therefore typically additional are wires included and higher voltage is applied

in order to obtain a gain on the signal, while the signal is still proportional

to the energy of the measured particle; these are the so-called proportional

chambers [9]. These detectors can be used as neutron detectors if appropriate

converters are applied that absorb the neutron while emitting detectable par-

ticles via a nuclear reaction. In the case of 3He- or 10BF3-based detectors the

converter is the counting gas itself, but solid converters could be used as well

with conventional counting gases.

Thermal neutron detector development. One leading development has been set

on the Ar/CO2 gas ﬁlled detectors with solid enriched boron-carbide (10B4C)
neutron converters [10], detecting neutrons via the 10B(n,α)7Li reaction [11–

14]. With this technology the optimal thickness of the boron-carbide layer is

typically 1 µm [15], otherwise the emitted α particle is stopped inside the layer

and remains undetected. But, a thinner boron-carbide layer means smaller

neutron conversion eﬃciency. The idea behind the detector development at

ESS is the multiplication of boron-carbide neutron converter layers by using

repetitive geometrical structures, in order to increase the neutron conversion

3

eﬃciency and obtain a detection eﬃciency that is competitive with that of the

3He detectors [11; 12].

Shielding issues in detector development. The modern neutron instruments are

being developed to reach high eﬃciency, but also higher performance, such as

time or energy resolution to open new frontiers in experimentation. One of

the most representative characteristics of these instruments is the signal-to-

background ratio, which is targeted in the optimisation process. While the

traditional solutions for improving the signal-to-background ratio are based on

increasing the source power and improving the transmittance of neutron guides,

for modern instruments the background reduction via optimised shielding be-

comes equally relevant. For state-of-the-art instruments the cost of a back-

ground reducing shielding can be a major contribution in the total instrument

budget [16].

In order to optimise the shielding not only for radiation safety

purposes but in order to improve the signal-to-background ratio a detailed map

of potential background sources is essential. While the components of the radia-

tion background coming from the neutron source and the neutron guide system

are well known, the eﬀect of newly developed boron-carbide converter based

gaseous detectors still has to be examined, especially the background radia-

tion and potential self-radiation coming from the neutron activation of the solid

detector components and of the detector ﬁlling gas.

Argon activation. The experience over the last decades showed that for facil-

ities, e.g. nuclear power plants, research reactors and research facilities with

accelerator tunnels, there is a permanent activity emission during normal op-

eration that mainly contains airborne radionuclides [17–24]. For most of these

facilities 41Ar is one of the major contributors to the radiation release. 41Ar is

produced via thermal neutron capture from the naturally occurring 40Ar, which

is the main isotope of natural argon with 99.3 % abundance [25]. At most fa-

cilities 41Ar is produced from the irradiation of the natural argon content of

air. In air-cooled and water-cooled reactors 40Ar is exposed in the reactor core

as part of the coolant; in the latter case it is coming from the air dissolved

4

in the primary cooling water. Air containing argon is also present in the nar-

row gap between the reactor vessel and the biological shielding. The produced

41Ar mixes with the air of the reactor hall and is removed by the ventilation

system.

In other facilities 41Ar is produced in the accelerator tunnel.

In all

cases, within the radiation safety plan of the facility the 41Ar release is taken

into account [26] and well estimated either via simple analytical calculations or

Monte Carlo simulations. The average yearly 41Ar release of these facilities can

reach a few thousand GBq.

For the ESS the 41Ar release coming from the accelerator and the spallation

target is already calculated [27–29], but in addition the exposure of the large

volume of Ar/CO2 contained in the neutron detectors should also be considered.

Due to the 70-90 % argon content of the counting gas and the fact that most

instruments operate with thermal or cold neutron ﬂux that leads to a higher av-

erage reaction rate, the 41Ar production in the detectors could be commensurate

with the other sources. For all the above mentioned reasons, argon activation

is an issue to consider at ESS both in terms of activity release and in terms of

occupational exposure in the measurement hall.

3. Applied methods

Analytical calculation for neutron activation. Neutron activation occurs during

the (n,γ) reaction where a neutron is captured by a target nucleus. The capture

itself is usually followed by an instant photon emission; these are the so called

prompt photons. The energies of the emitted prompt photons are speciﬁc for

the target nucleus. After capturing the neutron, in most cases the nucleus gets

excited, and becomes radioactive; this is the process of neutron activation, and

the new radionuclide will suﬀer decay with its natural half-life. Due to their

higher number of neutrons, the activated radionuclei mostly undergo β− decay,

accompanied by a well-measurable decay gamma radiation. The gamma ener-

gies are speciﬁc for the radionucleus. These two phenomena form the basics of

two long-used and reliable analytical techniques, the neutron activation anal-

5

ysis (NAA [30–32]) and the prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA [33]).

Consequently, detailed measured and simulated data are available for neutron

activation calculation.

For shielding and radiation safety purposes the produced activity concen-

tration (a [Bq/cm3]) and the prompt photon intensity have to be calculated

that are depending on the number of activated nuclei (N ∗ [1/cm3]). The pro-

duction of radionuclides (reaction rate) depends on the number of target nuclei

(N0 [1/cm3]) for each relevant isotope, the irradiating neutron ﬂux (Φ [n/cm3/s])
and the (n,γ) reaction cross section (σ [cm2]) at the irradiating neutron energies,

while the loss of radionuclides is determined by their decay constants (λ [1/s]).

A basic assumption is that the number of target nuclei can be treated as con-

stant if the loss of target nuclei during the whole irradiation does not exceed

0.1 %. This condition is generally fulﬁlled, like in the cases examined in this

study, therefore the rate of change of the number of activated nuclei is given by

Equation 1.

dN ∗
dt

= N0 · Φ · σ − λ · N ∗

(1)

With the same conditions, the activity concentration after a certain time of

irradiation (tirr[s]) can be calculated with Equation 2.

a (tirr) = N0 · Φ · σ · (cid:0)1 − eλtirr (cid:1)

(2)

In this study, as the activation calculation is based on Equation 2, the activ-

ity yield of the naturally present radionuclides (e.g. cosmogenic 14C in CO2) is

ignored due to the very low abundance of these nuclides. The activity yield of

the secondary activation products, the products of multiple independent neu-

tron captures on the same target nucleus, are ignored as well, because of the

low probability of the multiple interaction.

The prompt gamma intensity (I [1/s/cm3]) coming from the neutron cap-

ture can be calculated similarly to the (n,γ) reaction rate. In this case a prompt

gamma line (i) speciﬁc cross section (σpg,i) has to be used [34], that is propor-

tional to the (n,γ) cross section, the natural abundance of the target isotope in

6

the target element, and the weight of the speciﬁc gamma energy with respect

to the total number of gamma lines. For this reason in Equation 3 the num-

ber of target nuclei corresponds to the element (N (cid:48)

0 [1/cm3]), not the isotope

(N0 [1/cm3]).

Ii = N (cid:48)

0 · Φ · σpg,i

(3)

In the current study, activity concentration, prompt gamma intensity and

the respective prompt gamma spectrum have been calculated for each isotope

in the natural composition [25] of an 80/20 volume ratio Ar/CO2 counting

gas at room temperature and 1 bar pressure and in an aluminium alloy used

for the detector frame. Alloy Al5754 [35] has been chosen as a typical alloy

used in nuclear science for mechanical structures. Activity concentration and

prompt gamma intensity calculations have been done for several monoenergetic

neutron beams in the range of 0.6–10 ˚A (227.23–0.82 meV). Since for isotopes of

interest the energy dependence of the (n,γ) cross section is in the 1/v (velocity)

region [36; 37], the cross sections for each relevant energy have been easily

extrapolated from the thermal (1.8 ˚A) neutron capture cross sections listed in

Table A1.

The irradiating neutron ﬂux has been approximated with 104 n/cm2/s. This

value has been determined for a worst case scenario based on the following

assumptions: the planned instruments are going to have various neutron ﬂuxes

at the sample position, and the highest occurring ﬂux can be conservatively

estimated to 1010 n/cm2/s [38]. The neutron fraction scattered from the sample

is in the range of 1-10 %. Calculating with 10 %, the approximation remains

conservative. A realistic sample surface is 1 cm2, reducing the scattered ﬂux to

109 n/s. The sample-detector distance also varies among the instruments, so the

smallest realistic distance of 100 cm was used for a conservative approximation.

Therefore the neutron yield has to be normalised to a 105 cm2 surface area

at this sample-detector distance. According to these calculations, 104 n/cm2/s

is a conservative estimation for the neutron ﬂux the detector is exposed to.

7

This simple approach allows that the result can be scaled to alternate input

conditions, i.e. a higher neutron ﬂux or detector geometry.

MCNP simulation for neutron activation. Monte Carlo simulations have been

performed in order to determine the expected activity concentration and prompt

gamma intensity in the counting gas and the aluminium frame of boron-carbide-

based neutron detectors.

The MCNP6.1 [39] version has been used for the simulations. The detector

gas volume has been approximated as a generic 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm cube,

surrounded by a 5 mm thick aluminium box made of Al5754 alloy, representing

the detector frame, as it is described in Figure 1. In order to avoid interference

with the prompt photon emission of the Ar/CO2, the counting gas was replaced

with vacuum while observing the activation on the aluminium frame. The de-

tector geometry has been irradiated with a monoenergetic neutron beam from

a monodirectional disk source of 8.5 cm radius at 50 cm distance from the sur-

face of the target volume. A virtual sphere has been deﬁned around the target

gas volume with 10 cm radius for simplifying prompt photon counting. Both

the activity concentration and the prompt gamma intensity determined with

MCNP6.1 simulations have been scaled to a 104 n/cm2/s irradiating neutron

ﬂux.

Figure 1: Neutron irradiation geometry used in MCNP6 simulation.

8

Diﬀerent runs have been prepared for each element in the gas mixture and

the Al5754 alloy to determine the prompt gamma spectrum and total intensity.

The prompt photon spectrum has been determined for each element with the

following method: a virtual sphere has been deﬁned around the cubic target

volume. Since the target volume was located in vacuum, all the prompt photons

produced in a neutron activation reaction have to cross this virtual surface.

Within MCNP, the particle current integrated over a surface, can be easily

determined (F1 tally [39]). Knowing the volume of the target, the prompt

photon intensity can be calculated for the simulated neutron ﬂux (ΦM CN P ,

[ﬂux/source particle]). After the ΦM CN P average neutron ﬂux in the target

volume has been determined (F4 tally [39]), the prompt photon intensity can

be scaled for any desired neutron ﬂux, 104 n/cm2/s in this case. With this

method the self-absorption of the target gas volume can be considered to be

negligible.

The activity concentration is not given directly by the simulation, but it

can be calculated from the RM CN P reaction rate (reaction/source particle)

and the ΦM CN P ﬂux. The RM CN P is calculated in MCNP in the following

way: ﬁrst the track length density of neutrons has to be determined in the

target volume (F4 tally [39]), and then this value has to be multiplied with

the reaction cross section of the speciﬁc reaction of interest, through the en-

tire spectrum, taking into account the number of target nuclei of the irradiated

material (FM tally multiplication card [39]). In the current simulations each

isotope has been deﬁned as a diﬀerent material, with their real partial atomic

density ([atom/barn/cm]) in the counting gas or in the aluminium alloy for the

(n,γ) reaction (ENDF reaction 102). As the reaction rate given by the MCNP

simulation is the saturated reaction rate for the ΦM CN P ﬂux, and contains all

the geometrical and material conditions of the irradiation, the time-dependent

activity concentration for any Φ ﬂux can be calculated with Equation 4.

a (tirr) = RM CN P ·

Φ
ΦM CN P

· (cid:0)1 − eλtirr (cid:1)

In order to determine the above mentioned quantities, the cross section li-

braries have to be chosen carefully for the simulation. Within the current study

diﬀerent libraries have been used to simulate the prompt gamma production

and the reaction rates. Several databases have been tested, but only a few

of them contain data on photon production for the isotopes of interest. Ta-

bles A2 and A4 present the combinations that give the best agreement with the

theoretical expectations, especially in terms of spectral distribution. These are

the ENDF [37], TALYS [40] and LANL [41] databases.

The MCNP6.1 simulation has been repeated for each naturally occurring

isotope in the counting gas and the aluminium frame, and analytical calculations

have been also prepared to validate the simulation, in order to obtain reliable

and well-applicable data on the detector housing and counting gas activation

and gamma emission both for shielding and for radiation protection purposes.

In order to demonstrate the eﬀect of gamma radiation on the measured

signal, the signal-to-background has been calculated for a typical and realistic

detector geometry. A generic boron-carbide based detector can be represented

by a 5-20 mm thick gas volume surrounded by a few millimetre thin aluminium

box, carrying the few micrometers thick boron-carbide converter layer(s). The

gas volume is determined by the typical distance needed for the energy deposi-

tion. In a realistic application, a larger gas volume used to be used for eﬃciency

purposes, built up from the above mentioned subvolumes. As a representative

example a Vgas = 256 cm3 counting gas volume has been chosen as the source
of gamma production, with an Ain = 16 cm2 entrance surface for incident neu-

trons, divided into 20 mm thick subvolumes by 16 layers of 2 µm thin enriched

boron-carbide.

In this study the gamma eﬃciency has been approximated with 10−7 for the

entire gamma energy range [42; 43] due to its relatively low energy-dependence,

whereas the neutron eﬃciency has been calculated for all the mentioned energies

on the basis of [11], resulting in a neutron eﬃciency varying between 0.4-0.72

within the given energy range. Therefore the measured signal and the signal

of the gamma background were calculated as in Equations 5-6, where ηi is the

10

detection eﬃciency for the particle type i, Φ is the incident neutron ﬂux and

Iphoton is the produced photon production in a unit gas volume. Signal-to-

(gamma-)background ratio has been calculated as Sn/Sγ.

Sn = Ain · Φ · ηn

Sγ = Vgas · Iphoton · ηγ

(5)

(6)

All calculations and simulations have been done for a 104 n/cm2/s monoen-

ergetic neutron irradiation for 0.6, 1, 1.8, 2, 4, 5 and 10 ˚A neutron wavelengths.

Activity concentration has been calculated for tirr = 106 s irradiation time
and tcool = 107 s cooling time. This irradiation time roughly corresponds to

typical lengths of operation cycles for spallation facilities. Photon production

has been normalised for a 1 cm3 volume, irradiated with Φ = 1 n/cm2/s or

Φ = 104 n/cm2/s neutron ﬂux. Therefore here the photon production in a unit
gas or aluminium volume irradiated with a unit ﬂux is given as photon/cm3/s

.

n/cm2/s

The uncertainties of the simulated and the bibliographical data have been

taken into account. The MCNP6.1 simulations had high enough statistics, that

the uncertainties of the simulated results were comparable to the uncertainties

of the measured/bibliographical qualities used for the analytical calculations.

The uncertainty of the total prompt photon production for all elements were

below 5 % for the entire neutron energy range, while the uncertainties of the

main prompt gamma lines were below 10 % for all elements, and less than 5 %

for argon and the elements of the aluminium alloy.

For the anaytical calculations, the error propagation takes into account the

uncertainty of the prompt gamma line speciﬁc cross section, given in the IAEA

PGAA Database [34], being below 5 % for the main lines of all major isotopes,

the σ absorption cross section and the λ decay constant (see Appendix). The

obtained uncertainties of the photon intensities are generally within the size of

the marker, here the error bars have been omitted. They have also been omitted

for some of the spectra for better visibility.

4. Results and discussion

4.1. Prompt gamma intensity in detector counting gas

The total prompt photon production and its spectral distribution in Ar/CO2

counting gas has been analytically calculated (Equation 3) on the basis of de-

tailed prompt gamma data from IAEA PGAA Data-base [34]. The same data

have been obtained with Monte Carlo simulation using MCNP6.1.

Prompt photon production normalised to incident neutron ﬂux has been cal-

culated for all mentioned wavelengths. The comparison of the result has shown,

that the simulated and calculated total prompt photon yields qualitatively agree

for Ar, C, and O within 2 %, 11 % and 21 %, respectively.

12

It has also been show that for these three elements proper cross section li-

braries can be found (see Table A2), the use of which in MCNP simulations

produce prompt photon spectra that qualitatively agree with the calculated

ones. As an example Figure 2 shows the simulated and calculated prompt pho-
ton spectra from argon in Ar/CO2 for a 1.8 ˚A, Φ = 1 n/cm2/s neutron ﬂux,
irradiating a 1 cm3 volume. Since numerous databases lack proper prompt pho-

ton data, this agreement is not trivial to achieve for all the elements. For these

three elements MCNP simulations can eﬀectively replace analytical calculations,

which is especially valuable for more complex geometries. For all these reasons

hereinafter only the MCNP6.1 simulated results are presented.

calculations with input data taken from IAEA PGAA Database [34], as explained in text.

(For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure caption, the reader is referred to

the web version of this article.)

In Figure 3 it is also shown, that the prompt photon emission is dominated

13

by argon, as expected due to the very small capture cross section of the oxygen

and the carbon; the argon total prompt photon yield is 3 orders of magnitude

higher than the highest of the rest. According to Figure 2, within the argon

prompt gamma spectrum, there are 3 main gamma lines that are responsible

for the majority of the emission; the ones at 167 ± 20 keV, 1187 ± 3 keV and

4745 ± 8 keV.

4.2. Activity concentration and decay gammas in detector counting gas

The induced activity in the irradiated Ar/CO2 gas volume, as well as the

photon yield coming from the activated radionuclei has been determined via an-

alytical calculation, based on the bibliographical thermal (25.30 meV) neutron

capture cross sections and the half-lives of the isotopes in the counting gas (see

Table A1). A similar calculation has been prepared on the bases of reaction

rates determined with MCNP simulations for each isotope of the counting gas.

Activity concentrations obtained from the calculation and the MCNP6.1 simu-

lation agree within the margin of error, therefore only the MCNP simulations

are presented.

As an example the build-up of activity during irradiation time for 1.8 ˚A is

given in Figure 4 for all the produced radionuclei.

It can be stated, that the total activity of the irradiated counting gas prac-

tically equals the 41Ar activity (see Figure 4), which is 1.28 · 10−1 Bq/cm3 at

the end of the irradiation time. This is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the

activity of 37Ar, which is 6.90 · 10−4 Bq/cm3, and 7 orders of magnitude higher

than the activity of 38Ar (7.99 · 10−9 Bq/cm3) and 19O (3.19 · 10−8 Bq/cm3).

The activity of carbon is negligible.

The decrease of activity in the detector counting gas because of the natural

radioactive decay is shown in Figure 5. After the end of the irradiation the main

component of the total activity is the 41Ar, although it practically disappears

after a day (105 s), due to its short 109.34 m half-life with 37Ar becoming the

dominant isotope. However, in terms of gamma emission, all the remaining

isotopes, 37Ar, 39Ar and 14C are irrelevant, since they are pure beta-emitters.

106 s irradiation time. Results of MCNP6.1 simulation, as explained in text. (For interpreta-

tion of the references to color in this ﬁgure caption, the reader is referred to the web version

of this article.)

Therefore, with the above listed conditions there is only minimal gamma emis-

sion from the Ar/CO2 counting gas after 105 s cooling time. For the same
reason, the 41Ar activity quickly saturates and accordingly it can contribute to

the gamma emission during the irradiation as well.

Decay gamma emission of the activated radionuclei from a unit volume per

second, with the activity reached by the end of the irradiation time have been

calculated. It is shown that the decay gamma yield practically all comes from

the activated argon; the emission of the 1293.587 keV 41Ar line is 8 orders of

magnitudes higher than the yield of any other isotope.

Comparing the prompt and the maximum decay gamma emission of all the

isotopes, as it is shown in Table 1, it is revealed that for the argon, the prompt

this article.)

photon production (3.9 · 10−1 photon/cm3/s
production (1.27 · 10−1 photon/cm3/s

n/cm2/s

n/cm2/s

) and the saturated decay gamma

) are comparable. There is a factor of 3

diﬀerence, whereas for carbon and oxygen the decay gamma production is neg-

ligible comparing with the prompt gamma production.

Figure 3 and Table 1 demonstrate that, as both the prompt and the decay

gamma yield are determined by the neutron absorption cross section, their en-

ergy dependence follows the 1/v rule within the observed energy range in case

of all the isotopes of the Ar/CO2 counting gas. Therefore activation with cold

neutrons produces a higher yield, and the thermal fraction is negligible.

As it has been indicated, most of the activated nuclei are beta emitters,

and some of the isotopes in the Ar/CO2 are pure beta emitters, therefore the

eﬀect of beta radiation should also be evaluated. In Table 2, the activated beta-

emitter isotopes in Ar/CO2 and the most signiﬁcant ones of them in aluminium

housing have been collected. As an example, according to the calculated activ-

ity concentrations (see Figure 4), only 41Ar has a considerable activity in the

counting gas. Therefore the only beta that might be taken into account is the

1197 keV 41Ar beta. However, with the usual threshold settings [15] of propor-

tional systems, the energy-deposition of the beta-radiation does not appear in

the measured signal. Therefore on the one hand, the eﬀect of beta radiation is

negligible in terms of the detector signal-to-background ratio, while on the other

hand, in terms of radiation protection, due to the few 10 cm absorption length

in gas and few millimeters absorption length in aluminium, the beta exposure

from the detector is also negligible.

Consequently only the prompt and the decay gamma emission have consid-

erable yield to the measured background spectrum, and both of them are domi-

nated by the 41Ar, during and after the irradiation. A typical neutron beam-on

gamma emission spectrum is shown in Figure 6, for 1.8 ˚A, 104 n/cm2/s incident

neutron ﬂux, calculated with saturated 41Ar activity.

In order to demonstrate how the gamma radiation background, induced by

neutrons in the detector itself, aﬀects the measured signal, signal-to-background

ratio has been calculated for detector-ﬁlling gas, on the basis of Equations 5 and 6.

As afore described, Ar/CO2 can be represented with 41Ar in terms of gamma

emission. According to its very small saturation time, both the prompt and the

decay gamma production have been considered in the background.

19

simulated with MCNP6.1 and decay constant data from Table of Isotopes [25], as explained in

text. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure caption, the reader is referred

to the web version of this article.)

In Figure 7 the good agreement of the calculated and the simulated signal-to-

background ratios are shown, for the self-induced gamma background coming

from neutron activation. For both cases, the signal-to-background ratio in-

creases with the square root of the energy and varies between 109 −1010 through

the entire energy range. The calculation has been done with a 10−1 order of mag-

nitude neutron eﬃciency, that is typical for a well-designed boron-carbide based

neutron detector, and it has been shown that the eﬀect of gamma background

is really small, giving only a negligible contribution to the measured signal.

Moreover, applying the same calculation for beam monitors, having the lowest

possible neutron eﬃciency (approximated as 10−5), the signal-to-background

ratio is still 105, meaning that even for beam monitors the self-induced gamma

background is vanishingly small.

4.3. Prompt gamma intensity in Al5754 aluminium frame

The prompt and decay photon yield of the aluminium frame or housing of

the detectors have been determined via analytical calculation and MCNP6.1

simulation with the same methods and parameters as the ones used for the

Ar/CO2. Prompt photon production normalised with incident neutron ﬂux has

been calculated.

For the Al5754 alloy as well, the calculated and MCNP6.1 simulated spectra

qualitatively agree, although the agreement within the total prompt photon

production varies from element to element, as shown in Table 3. Even with the

best ﬁtting choice of cross section databases (Table A4), the diﬀerence is not

21

higher than 10 % for most elements, but for Mn and Zn the diﬀerences between

the prompt photon productions are 28 % and 23 %, respectively. However,

since for all isotopes of these elements the simulation results are conservative,

the MCNP simulation remains reliable. Figure 8 is given as an example to

show the produced prompt photon spectrum for Φ = 1 n/cm2/s neutron ﬂux,

irradiating an 1 cm3 volume.

unit ﬂux of 1.8 ˚A neutrons. Results of MCNP6.1 simulation, as explained in text.

(For

interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure caption, the reader is referred to the web

version of this article.)

Comparing the prompt photon emission from a unit volume of Al5754 with

the same for Ar/CO2 (see Table 1) it can be stated, that the prompt photon

intensity coming from the aluminium housing is 3 orders of magnitude higher

than the one coming from the counting gas. However, for large area detectors,

like the ones used in chopper spectrometry, where the gas volume might be

22

105 cm3 (see [3–6]) the prompt photon yield of the detector counting gas can

become comparable to that of the solid frame.

The two main contributors to the prompt photon emission are the aluminium

and the manganese (Figure 9); the aluminium total prompt photon yield is

2 order of magnitudes, while the manganese total prompt photon yield is 1 order

of magnitude higher than the yield of the rest, respectively. Consequently,

even the minor components in the aluminium alloy can be relevant for photon

production, if they are having a considerable neutron capture cross section.

According to Figure 8, within the simulated Al5754 prompt gamma spectrum,

there is one main gamma line that is responsible for the majority of the emission,

7724.03 ± 0.04 keV line of 27Al. It has to be mentioned, that in the analytically

calculated spectrum a second main gamma line appears at 30.638 ± 0.001 keV,

also from 27Al; it only has a signiﬁcant yield on the basis of IAEA Data, that is

not reproduced within the simulation. However, the mentioned gamma energy

is low enough that for practical purposes the MCNP simulation remains reliable.

4.4. Activity concentration and decay gammas in Al5754 aluminium frame

An analytical calculation has been performed in order to determine the in-

duced activity in the irradiated aluminium housing, as well as the photon yield

coming from the activated radionuclides, with the same methods that have been

used for the counting gas. The calculation was based on the bibliographical

thermal neutron capture cross sections and the half-lives of the isotopes in the

AL5754 aluminium alloy (see Table A3).

An example of the activity build-up during irradiation time for 1.8 ˚A is pre-

sented in Figure 10 for all the produced radionuclei. According to Figures 10

and 12, for most of the isotopes in Al5754 the activity concentrations obtained

from calculations and MCNP6.1 simulations agree within the margin of error or

24

within the range of 5 %. However, for a few isotopes the diﬀerence is signiﬁcant.

In the case of 55Cr with the most suitable choice of cross section libraries largest

discrepancy between the simulations and the calculations [44] is 13 %. Also ex-

tra care is needed when treating Zn in the simulations; with calculations made

on the basis of the thermal neutron cross section data of Mughabghab [44], the

discrepancies for 65Zn, 69Zn, 71Zn are 5 %, 7 % and 10 % respectively, while

in the case of using the NIST database [45] for the calculations, the diﬀerences

were 18 %, 3 % and 1 %. Since 64Zn, the parent isotope of 65Zn is the major

component in the natural zinc, the usage of the ﬁrst database is recommended.

According to Table 1, the activity concentration of the zinc is 5 orders of magni-

tude smaller than the highest occurring activity concentration, hence the large

diﬀerence between the calculated and the simulated result does not have a sig-

niﬁcant impact on the results of the whole alloy.

In Figure 10 it is demonstrated, that the majority of the produced total

activity is estimated to be given by the 28Al and the 55Mn, 1.33 · 102 Bq/cm3

and 1.96 · 101 Bq/cm3 at the end of the irradiation time, respectively. It is also

shown, that for all isotopes the activity concentration saturates quickly at the

beginning of the irradiation time, therefore the decay gamma radiation is also

produced practically during the entire irradiation time, with a yield constant in

time.

The decay gamma intensity of the activated radionuclei from a unit volume

has also been calculated, with the activity reached by the end of the irradiation

time, like in case of Ar/CO2 (see Table 1). It is shown that the decay gamma

given by the 28Al and 55Mn; their decay photon emission is 3 and 2 orders of

magnitude higher then the rest. The decay gamma spectrum is dominated by

the 1778.969 ± 0.012 keV line of 28Al.

Figure 9 and Table 1 demonstrate, that for aluminium and manganese the

prompt photon production (2.47 · 102 and 5.27 · 101 photon/cm3/s
rated decay gamma production (1.33 · 102 and 2.8 · 101 photon/cm3/s

n/cm2/s

) and the satu-

n/cm2/s

) are com-

parable; the yield of decay photon is 53-54 % of that of the prompt photon one,

whereas for all the other isotopes the decay gamma production is less than 1 %

alloy during a 106 s irradiation time. Results of MCNP6.1 simulation and analytical calcula-

compared to the prompt gamma production.

Figure 11 depicts that the total gamma emission spectrum during the neu-

tron irradiation is dominated by the aluminium. The majority of the total

photon yield comes from the 27Al prompt gamma emission, while the two main

lines of the measured spectrum are the 1778.969 ± 0.012 keV 28Al decay gamma

and the 7724.03 ± 0.04 keV 27Al prompt gamma line.

The decrease of activity in the detector counting gas because of the natural

radioactive decay has also been calculated and the obtained results are shown

in Figure 12, like in the case of Ar/CO2 in Figure 5. There are three isotopes

that become major components of the total activity for some period during the

cooling time: 28Al with 1 order of magnitude higher activity than the rest within

0-6·103 s (10 min), 56Mn with 2 orders of magnitude higher activity than the rest

within 6·103-106 s (11 days), and 51Cr with 1 order of magnitude higher activity

than the rest from 106 s, therefore the total activity decrease is relatively fast.

However, because of the long half-life of 55Fe, (T 1

2

= 2.73 ± 0.03 y), a small

backround activity is expected to remain for years after the irradiation.

5. Conclusions

Analytical calculations and MCNP6.1 modelling have been prepared and

compared in order to study the eﬀect of neutron activation in boron-carbide-

based neutron detectors. A set of MCNP6.1 cross section databases has been

27

collected for Ar/CO2 counting gas and aluminium detector housing estimated

as Al5754, which both give good agreement with the analytical calculations, or

give an acceptable, conservative estimation both for prompt gamma production

and activity calculations. These databases are recommended to use for more

complex geometries, where the analytical calculations should be replaced by

MCNP simulations.

It has been shown, that the prompt photon emission of the aluminium hous-

ing is dominated by the Al and Mn contributors, while that of the counting gas

is mainly given by Ar. The prompt photon intensity from an aluminium-housing

unit volume is 3 orders of magnitude higher than from that of the counting gas.

The total activity concentration of the housing is mainly given by the 28Al

28

and the 56Mn, and given by the 41Ar in the counting gas. Due to the short

half-lives of the main isotopes, their decay gammas already appear and saturate

during the irradiation period, giving a comparable decay gamma emission to

the prompt photon emission in terms of yield.

With the afore mentioned typical counting gas, the decay gamma yield of

41Ar saturates at 1.28 · 10−1Bq/cm3, and based on this value, operational sce-

narios can be envisaged. With these results it has been shown, that only a low

level of activation is expected in the detector counting gas. Therefore with a

ﬂushing of 1 detector volume of gas per day, assuming a V = 107 cm3 detector

volume, 1.28 · 106 Bq/day activity production is expected. By varying the ﬂush

rate and storing the counting gas up to 1 day before release, only negligible

levels of activity will be present in the waste Ar/CO2 stream.

Neutron-induced gamma signal-to-background ratio has also been deter-

mined for several neutron energies, revealing that the signal-to-background ratio

changes within the range of 109 − 1010 for general boron-carbide-based detec-

tor geometries, and still being 105 even for beam monitors, having the lowest

possible eﬃciency.

The eﬀect of beta-radiation coming from the activated isotopes has also

been considered, and it can be stated that the beta-radiation is negligible both

in terms of the signal-to-background ratio and in terms of radiation protection.

In this study all simulations and calculations were made for a generic geom-

etry, and a reliable set of data on activity and photon production were given

that can be generally applied and scaled for any kind or boron-carbide-based

neutron detector, ﬁlled with Ar/CO2.
