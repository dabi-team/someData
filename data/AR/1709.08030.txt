Abstract

Basic R & D have been carried out with one small straw tube detector
prototype with premixed gas of Ar+CO2 in 70:30 and 90:10 ratio. The gain
and the energy resolution are measured with Fe55 X-ray source. Eﬀect of
temperature and pressure on these parameters are measured. The variation
of gain and energy resolution with rate per unit length are also measured. The
details of the test set-up, the method of measurement and the test results are
presented in this paper.

Introduction

The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment [1] at the future Facil-
ity for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) [2] in Darmstadt, Germany is
designed to explore the QCD phase diagram in the region of moderate baryon
densities. With CBM we will enter a new era of nuclear matter research by
measuring rare diagnostic probes never observed before at FAIR energies, and
thus CBM has a unique discovery potential. This will only be possible with
the application of advanced instrumentation, including highly segmented and
fast gaseous detectors. Keeping in mind the high interaction rate of FAIR,
the Muon Chamber (MuCh) detector in CBM will use Gas Electron Multi-
plier (GEM) in the ﬁrst two stations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Given the interaction
rate of 10 MHz the expected particle ﬂux on the ﬁrst station will be about
3.1 MHz/cm2. Maximum particle ﬂux on the 3rd and 4th stations of the MuCh
have been estimated to be 10 kHz/cm2 and 3 kHz/cm2, respectively, for cen-
tral Au-Au collisions at 8 AGeV [9]. We are exploring the possibility of using
straw tubes for the 3rd and 4th stations of CBM-MuCh [10].

Straw tubes are currently being used in large High Energy Physics (HEP)
experiments as tracking detector with low material budget [11]. A straw tube
detector is basically a gas ﬁlled single channel drift tube with a conductive

inner layer as cathode and a wire stretched along the axis as anode. When high
voltage is applied between the wire and the tube an electric ﬁeld is generated
in the gas ﬁlled region. The electric ﬁeld separates electrons and positive ions
produced by an incident charged particle along its trajectory through the gas
volume. The wire is kept at positive voltage and collects the electrons while
the ions drift towards the cathode. By choosing thin wires, with a diameter
of a few tens of µm, the electric ﬁeld strength near the wire is made high
enough to create an avalanche of electrons. Depending on the high voltage
and the gas composition a gain of about 104 - 105 can be achieved [12]. The
speciﬁc energy loss (dE/dx) of a charged particle in the straw gas volume can
be used to identify the particle species and can be derived from the number of
ionisation electrons per track length (dx) for the generated straw signal. Main
advantage of using straw tube in a tracking system is reduction of material
budget.

A systematic study of the characteristics of straw tube detectors with
conventional Argon based gas mixtures has been performed. The motivation
of this work is to study the rate handling capacity of straw tube detector
and to measure the variation of gain and energy resolution using Fe55 X-
ray spectrum. The details of the measurement process and the experimental
results are presented in this article.

2 Experimental set-up

Figure 1: The straw tube prototype : 6 straws, each of diameter 6 mm and length
20 cm.

A straw tube prototype shown in Figure 1 is obtained from JINR, Dubna,
Russia with 6 straws of diameter 6 mm and length 20 cm. Pre-mixed Ar/CO2
in 70/30 and 90/10 volume ratio have been used for the diﬀerent measure-
ments. A constant gas ﬂow rate of 3 l/h is maintained using a V¨ogtlin gas

ﬂow meter. The detector is tested using conventional NIM electronics. The
positive high voltage (HV) is applied to one end of the central wire of the
straws using a HV ﬁlter box and the signal is collected from the other end
through a capacitor using LEMO connector. Single HV channel is used for
each straw tube. The output signal from the straw is fed to a charge sensitive
preampliﬁer (VV50-2) [13]. The gain of the preampliﬁer is 2 mV/fC. The
output of the preampliﬁer is then fed to a linear Fan-in-Fan-out (linear FIFO)
module. To measure the rate of incident particle the analog signal from the
linear FIFO is put to a timing SCA (Single Channel Analyzer). The SCA
is operated in integral mode and the lower level in the SCA is used as the
threshold to the signal. The threshold is set at 1.3 V to reject all the noise.
The discriminated TTL signal is fed to a TTL-NIM adopter and the output
is counted using a NIM scaler. The count rate (i.e. counts per second) of
the detector is then calculated. To obtain the energy spectrum, one output
of the linear FIFO is fed to a Multi Channel Analyser (MCA). A schematic
representation of the set-up is shown in Figure 2.

3 Experimental results

The energy spectrum for the Fe55 X-rays is obtained and the absolute gain
and energy resolution are measured in the particular study. Figure 3 shows
a typical spectrum recorded with a straw tube detector for Fe55 source at
a biasing voltage of 1650 V with Ar/CO2 in 70/30 gas mixture.
In this
spectrum, the main peak (5.9 keV full energy peak) and the escape peak are
clearly visible and well separated from the noise peak. The gain of the detector

has been measured by obtaining the mean position of 5.9 keV peak of Fe55
X-ray spectrum with Gaussian ﬁtting.
The expression for gain is given by:

gain =

=

output charge
input charge
(mean pulse height/2mV ) f C × 1015
N o. of primary electrons × e C

(1)

(2)

where the mean pulse height for 5.9 keV peak in ADC channel number is
obtained by Gaussian ﬁtting and that in mV is obtained from the ADC cal-
ibration curve (ADC channel no. vs pulse height). The preampliﬁer used in
the set-up oﬀers a gain of 2 mV/fC which has been used in the expression
for gain. The input charge is the primary number of electrons produced in
the gas detector as a result of total absorption of an X-ray photon of energy
5.9 keV, multiplied by the electronic charge (e). For each 5.9 keV Fe55 X-ray
photon exposed in Ar/CO2 gas with 70/30 and 90/10 ratio, the number of
primary electrons approximately produced are 212 and 222 respectively.

The energy resolution of the detector is deﬁned as:

% energy resolution =

sigma × 2.355
mean

× 100%

(3)

where the sigma and the mean are obtained from the Gaussian ﬁtting of the
spectrum. It is understood that a lower value of energy resolution means a
better energy resolution. The gain and energy resolution have been measured,
increasing the biasing voltage of the straw tube detector. It is observed that
the gain increases exponentially whereas the energy resolution value decreases
with the voltage as shown in Figure 4.

It is well known that the gain of any gaseous detector depends signiﬁcantly
on the ratio of temperature and pressure, (T/p). The dependence of the gain
(G) of a gaseous detector on absolute temperature and pressure is given by
the relation [14]

G(T /p) = Ae(B T
p )

(4)

where the parameters A and B are to be determined from the correlation plot.
The variation of the gain as a function of temperature and pressure is also
studied for the straw tube detector from the energy spectrum obtained using
the same Fe55 source with Ar/CO2 gas in 70/30 ratio. The detector is biased
with 1650 V and is exposed to X-rays from the Fe55 source and the energy
spectra are recorded. Simultaneously the temperature (t in ◦C), pressure (p
in mbar) and relative humidity (RH in %) are also recorded using a data
logger, built in-house [15]. The measurement is done for a time period of
∼ 340 minutes.

The absolute gain of the detector is calculated from the formula given in
equation 2. The variation of the measured gain is plotted as a function of
period of operation in Figure 5. The variation of the T/p as a function of the
total period of operation is also plotted in Figure 5, where T (= t+273) is
the absolute temperature in Kelvin and p (p in mbar/1013) is in the unit of
atmospheric pressure.

The correlation plot, i.e. the gain is plotted as a function of T/p and ﬁtted
with the function given by equation 4 and is shown in Figure 6 (in Figure 6
the parameters A and B are marked as p0 and p1 respectively).

The values of the ﬁt parameters A and B obtained, are 854.7 ± 3.305
and 0.0079 ± 1.284 × 10−5 atm pr/K. Using the ﬁt parameters, the gain is
normalised by using the relation:

To check the stability of the detector, the normalised gain is plotted against

lated per unit length is shown in Figure 7. There is a ﬂuctuation around 1
in the normalised gain value as shown in Figure 7. The distribution of the
normalised gain ﬁtted with a Gaussian function is shown in Figure 8. The
mean of the Gaussian distribution has been found to be around 1.002 with a
sigma of 0.006 as shown in Figure 8. In this study an accumulation of charge
per unit length ∼ 80 µC/mm is achieved.

in Figure 9 shows that during this time of ∼ 340 minutes the mean energy
resolution is 27.36% with a sigma of 0.09.

The variation of the gain and the energy resolution of the straw tube de-
tector is measured varying the rate of incident X-ray photons on the detector.
A collimator made with perspex is used for the Fe55 source to change the
rate of emitted X-ray. The collimator opening is changed to vary the rate
of particles incident on the detector. The energy spectrum is obtained for
each setting of the collimator. These measurements are performed with both
Ar/CO2 70/30 and 90/10 gas mixtures. For Ar/CO2 70/30 the measurements

are performed keeping the HV to the straws at 1650 V and 1700 V whereas
for Ar/CO2 90/10 it is done for HV 1400 V and 1450 V. For Ar/CO2 70/30
the gain and energy resolution are measured from a rate of about 200 Hz/mm
to about 3 × 104 Hz/mm and that for Ar/CO2 90/10 are performed for about
100 Hz/mm to about 6 × 104 Hz/mm. Measured gain and energy resolution as
a function of X-ray rate per unit length are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11
respectively. It is observed that for Ar/CO2 70/30 the gain and the energy
resolution remains constant up to a rate of about 2 × 104 Hz/mm then the
gain decreases and energy resolution value increases with rate. Similar eﬀect
is observed for Ar/CO2 90/10 as well, where the gain and energy resolution
remains constant up to a rate of about 3.2 × 104 Hz/mm.

For higher rates the gain (G) is ﬁtted with a function [16]

G = P e−Q . R

where P and Q are the ﬁt parameters and r is the rate.

For higher rates the energy resolution is ﬁtted with a function

energy resolution = P (cid:48)eQ(cid:48) . R

where P (cid:48) and Q(cid:48) are the ﬁt parameters and R is the rate.

The numerical values of P , Q, P (cid:48) and Q(cid:48) are tabulated in Table 1.
It is observed that for Ar/CO2 70/30 gas mixture the detector is operated
at relatively higher voltages and in this case decrease of gain with rate started
at relatively lower rate.

4 Conclusions and outlook

A systematic study on the basic characteristics of straw tube detector is per-
formed using conventional NIM electronics. In this study Ar/CO2 gas mixture
is used both in 70/30 and 90/10 volume ratio. The gain and energy resolution
are measured from the energy spectrum obtained using Fe55 X-ray source. To
check the eﬀect of temperature and pressure on the gain and energy resolution
a continuous measurement is performed. Same Fe55 X-ray source is used to
irradiate the detector and to obtain the spectrum. The measured gain is nor-
malised by T/p corrected gain. The normalised gain is found to be stable with
an average value of 1.002 with a sigma of 0.006 for a duration of ∼ 340 minutes
which is equivalent to an accumulation of charge per unit length ∼ 80 µC/mm.
In this study main emphasis is given on the variation of gain and energy res-
olution of the straw tube detector with X-ray rate. The gain and the energy
resolution remain constant up to a rate of about about 2 × 104 Hz/mm and
3.2 × 104 Hz/mm for Ar/CO2 70/30 and 90/10 respectively. Beyond these
quoted values gain decreases and the energy resolution increases with the in-
crease of rate. Keeping in mind the particle ﬂux straw tube is an option to be
used in the 3rd and 4th stations of CBM-MuCh. Possibility to use the straw
tube detector in CBM MuCh is under investigation.
