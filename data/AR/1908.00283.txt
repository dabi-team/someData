The discovery of the white dwarf binary system AR Scorpii (AR Sco) with its fascinating non-
thermal dominated multi-frequency emission has sparked renewed interest in potential high en-
ergy gamma-ray emission from white dwarf pulsars. The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)
below and above optical shows evidence of non-thermal synchrotron emission, with pulsed emis-
= 117 s) as well as a beat
sion in optical and X-ray bands at the white dwarf spin period (P
∗
period (Pb = 118.1 s) with the binary period. From an energy perspective, the highly magnetic
rotating white dwarf can accelerate particles to TeV energies. In this study, a search for high
energy gamma-ray emission was conducted between 100 MeV - 500 GeV by analysing the newly
available Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data with the new Fermi 1.0.1 Science Tools. Binned likelihood anal-

ysis was done using power law, broken power law and log parabola models. From the selected
Region of Interest (ROI) centred on AR Sco’s position, we calculated a signiﬁcance of √T S
≤
3.87σ for the integrated gamma-ray activity between 100 MeV - 500 GeV at a photon ﬂux level

tion that coincides with the position of AR Sco.

1. Introduction

Since the discovery of the peculiar close binary system AR Scorpii (AR Sco) in 2016, ([1])
which displays non-thermal dominated multi-frequency emission from radio to X-rays (see Fig. 1),
it has been the focus of intensive observational and theoretical investigation. This system consists
of a 0.8 - 1.29 M
500 MG (e.g. [2, 3])
M5 dwarf star with an orbital period of Porb = 3.56 hours. Assuming the
orbiting an 0.28-0.45 M
secondary star ﬁlls its Roche lobe, the distance to the system is estimated to be approximately d
116 pc [1].

frequencies. The red and blue curves represent model atmospheres of the red M5 secondary dwarf star (T =
3100 K) and white dwarf (T = 9750 K) respectively. Adopted from [1].

In the optical part of the spectrum (see [1]) the system reveals strong brightness variations
every 117 s (i.e. pulsations), which is the spin period of the white dwarf, superimposed on the
orbital period as well as strong pulsations at 118.2 s, which is a beat period between the spin period
and the binary orbital period (see Fig. 2). Both the spin and beat periods are clearly visible on a
power spectrum (see Fig. 3), especially at the ﬁrst harmonic where a clear differentiation can be
distinguished between the spin and beat periods [1].

due to a Rochle lobe ﬁlling (or nearly lobe ﬁlling) secondary star. Superimposed on this orbital light curve,
optical pulsations can be seen at the spin period (117 s) and beat period (118.2 s) with the binary system.

between the spin and orbital periods of the system. The beat pulse and the spin frequency are most prominent
at the ﬁrst harmonic, close to 17 mHz. The peak on the left represents the beat while the peak on the right
represents the spin frequency. Adopted from [1].

High-speed all-Stokes optical polarimetry utilizing the South African Astronomical Observa-
tory (SAAO) HIPPO Polarimeter [4] on the 1.9 m telescope reveals strong linear polarization at
levels up to 40 % with signiﬁcantly lower levels of circular polarization (< 10%), see Fig. 4, [2, 3].
The nature of the linear polarization proﬁle is consistent with synchrotron emission produced in
the magnetic ﬁeld of a rotating magnetic dipole, strengthening the notion that the white dwarf in
AR Sco is a white dwarf pulsar.

Also, the notion that nearly the entire Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) may be dominated
by non-thermal emission sparked enormous interest among theorists (e.g. [5, 6]). A favorite ap-
proach was to model the emission as being the result of the interaction between a highly magnetized
white dwarf pulsar and an M-type secondary dwarf star (see Fig. 5). It is proposed that the WD
is a nearly perpendicular rotator where both open ﬁeld lines sweep past the M-type in each ro-
tation period. The interaction between the particle beam streaming out from the open ﬁeld line
regions and the M-type wind would lead to the formation of a bow shock, where the relativistic
electrons can be accelerated by the large magnetic ﬁeld to produce possible synchrotron radiation
in the magnetic ﬁeld of the magnetosphere. However, it has also been shown that very high energy
gamma-ray production through a hadronic channel like π◦ is also possible [7], as well as inverse
Compton scattering.

Recent studies of the pulsed nature of the emission in X-rays using XMM-Newton data [8]

reveal pulsed emission consistent with the white dwarf spin period with a pulsed fraction of
∼
14 %. Here it is suggested that the X-ray emission is produced mainly by a thermal plasma on
the secondary star heated by magnetic pumping from the white dwarf’s magnetic ﬁeld lines that
sweeps across it during every rotation cycle. The X-ray luminosity of Lx = 4
1 is

then produced mainly by the thermalized electrons on the face of the secondary star, with the non-
thermal component, peaking in IR/Optical, produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in the
magnetosphere of the white dwarf [8]. It is also suggested that the relativistic electrons are trapped
within the white dwarf’s magnetic ﬁeld lines due to the magnetic mirror effect. Both the models
presented by Geng et. al. [5] and Takata et. al. [8] suggest non-thermal emission inside this region.
For AR Sco the ratio of the X-ray luminosity to spin-down power, i.e. α = Lx/L ˙νs,wd ∼
3,
is similar to another cataclysmic variable AE Aquarii and place both AR Sco and AE Aquarii in
the same class as spin-powered pulsars [9]. The high ratio of spin-down power to thermal X-ray
emission provides a reservoir for particle acceleration that makes AR Sco a possible candidate for
high energy gamma-ray emission like most other spin-powered pulsars [9].

2. Using 10 years of Fermi-LAT data to search for γ-ray emission

A Fermi-LAT dataset from the past decade (4Aug2008-18Mar2019) was extracted from the
Fermi Science Support Center (FSSC) in the energy range of 100 MeV to 500 GeV. By using the
Pass 8 data analysis pipeline, which provides a better determination of the diffuse galactic gamma-
ray emission and a signiﬁcant improvement in terms of energy resolution from previous Fermi-LAT
pipelines, it was possible to do a standard Binned Likelihood Analysis on the Fermi-LAT dataset.
The analysis was performed using the recently released Fermi Tools software, where a num-
ber of energy ranges were experimented with to ﬁt and produce likelihood statistics for AR Sco.
The event ﬁles, i.e. the photon and spacecraft ﬁles that were extracted from the FSSC site, were
chosen to have a Region of Interest (ROI) of 10◦ centred at ARSco (RA:16h21m47.28s, Dec:
22◦53′ 10.39′′ , J2000) in order to extract the high energy photons for analysis. During reduc-
−
tion, only SOURCE class events (evclass=128) were considered, along with the relational ﬁlter
(DATA_QUAL>0 and LAT_CONFIG==1) to select good time intervals. All the point sources
in the fourth Fermi-LAT catalogue (4FGL) located within the ROI were modelled in the spectral
ﬁts, including the latest isotropic background and galactic diffuse emission. All the point sources
included in the background model ﬁle are the same as reported in the 4FGL catalogue.

As AR Sco is not listed in the 4FGL catalogue we have followed the same methodology as
([10]), which reported the detection of a gamma-ray ﬂare from the high redshift blazar DA 193, by
manually adding the source to the model centred at its coordinates. The associated parameters of
spectral models of all the sources within a 2◦ radius were chosen to be free to vary while performing
the likelihood ﬁtting. Since AR Sco is not part of the 4FGL catalogue, it was ﬁrst added by
parameterizing a power law spectral shape where the prefactor and photon index of the model
were allowed to vary during optimization. A power law model was chosen since it is the easiest to
model and is analogous with non-thermal emission. After the power law model was added, both
broken power law and log parabola were also used to do a likelihood ﬁt. The ﬁnal results are
summarized in Table 1.

Results from a previous Fermi-LAT study, shown in Table 2 ([11]), using the methodology of
removing sources with a TS value less than 25 showed a possible gamma-ray emission from the
region. However, during the analysis process one of the sources closest to AR Sco,the unidentiﬁed
source 4FGL J1623.7-2315 nearly 0.6◦ away, was not taken into account during optimization and
may have contributed to emission attributed to AR Sco. These results revealed an excess at the
√T S
4.89σ level from the position of AR Sco between the energy range of 0.1 - 500GeV. Since

all the sources closest to the ROI centre has to be taken into account, the results obtained from this
method (see Table 2) needs to be adjusted by incorporating the associated parameters of spectral
models of all the sources within a 2◦ radius mentioned earlier.

Table 2: Summary of model parameters from the power law ﬁt for AR Sco reported in [11] excluding the
nearby unidentiﬁed source 4FGL J1623.7-2315. The signiﬁcance levels reported by these authors ([11]) are
therefore perhaps too optimistic due to contamination of this near-by ( 0.6◦) source !!

These new updated results (see Table 1) of our present analysis in the energy range of 0.1
3.87σ signiﬁcance level from the position of AR
- 500 GeV reveals low level emission at the
Sco. After the likelihood analysis has been performed, SEDs were plotted using e.g. the power
law model over 9 energy bins (see Fig. 6). The SED that was obtained using the Fermi build-in
function bdlikeSED. The energy ﬂux values can be considered as as 2 σ upper limits based on
a limiting TS < 4 value per bin. The distribution of TS values per energy bin (see Figure 7) also
illustrates that the most signiﬁcant emission is concentrated in the energy bins below 3 GeV.

From the distribution of TS vs energy results, see Fig. 7, we noticed a higher TS value from
the second energy bin compared to the total TS obtained, see Table 1. Likelihood analysis has been
done between the 100MeV-3GeV energy range to investigate this higher TS value. The results

within this energy range shows a total TS of 11.46 at a photon ﬂux of 0.611
1, which corresponds to the maximum TS value obtained in Fig. 7. Due to Fermi’s low
cm−
spatial resolution at lower energies, it may be possible for other nearby sources to still contribute
to the detected emission.

3. Conclusions

A search for possible gamma-ray emission from AR Sco was carried out by analysing the
Fermi-LAT Pass 8 dataset using the Fermi Science Tools. The results from a binned-likelihood
analysis on a ROI with a radius of 10◦ centred on the position of AR Sco, optimized with power-
law, broken power law and log parabola models, revealed low-level gamma-ray ﬂux between 100
MeV - 500 GeV at the 3.87σ level by considering the broken power law as the best ﬁt. This is
below the 5σ level heralding a possible detection. Due to the complexity of the surrounding region
and the Rho Oph molecular cloud, as well as the poor spatial resolution of the Fermi-LAT telescope
at lower energies, it is difﬁcult to pinpoint the exact origin of this low level gamma-ray emission.
Unbinned likelihood analysis is underway to try and maximise the probability of detection from
the emitting region.
