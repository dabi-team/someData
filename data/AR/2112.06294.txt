Abstract 

Present study explores the observation of topological non-hexagonal rings (NHR) and Stone Wale 
(SW) defects by Raman experiments in both single (SLG) and multi-layer graphene (MLG) after 
they are irradiated with 100–300 eV Ar ions. Although predicted by theoretical studies, here it is 
experimentally shown for the first time that graphene SW/NHR defects have a signature in Raman. 
Broad bandwidth of the pertinent Raman features suggests the presence of more than one SW/NHR 
defect mode, in agreement with the DFT studies. Variations in the SW/NHR related Raman mode 
intensities demonstrate the annihilation of these topological defects at higher energies. Behavior 
of Raman allowed G and 2D excitations, as well as the disorder-activated D, D’ and G* lines, has 
also been investigated in SLG and MLG. These indicate an evolution of defects in graphene with 
ion  irradiation,  as  well  as  presence  of  a  transition  state  beyond  which  the  Raman  modes  are 
dominated by a rise in sp3 content. Correlation of these aspects with the SW/NHR Raman provide 
significant  insight  into  ion  induced  evolution  of  graphene.  The  direct  observation  of  SW/NHR 
defects by Raman spectroscopy could be important in promoting exploration of rich topological 
aspects of Graphene in various fields. 

1. Introduction 

The  functional  properties  of  graphene  highlight  many  unique  aspects  of  the  two-dimensional 
systems [1, 2] and have led to many frontier applications in the field of devices and sensors [1].   
Development of the simplest electronic devices demands, however, knowledge of the defects [3]. 
Systematic  inclusion  of  the  defects  in  graphene  may  also  induce  many  unique  structural, 
vibrational,  electronic,  and  optical  properties  [4-9].  On  the  theoretical  front  also,  the  nature  of 
defects  in graphene  and  carbon nanotubes  show  many rich  characteristics [10-14] that demand 
more experimental understanding. The controlled introduction of defects, with electron or ions, 
provide  technologically  important  platforms  for  many  materials  [15-18]  that  illustrate  many 
important aspects and challenges in graphene [4-9, 19-21]. Formation of graphene quantum dots 
and  the  opening  of  electronic  energy  bandgap,  with  the  introduction  of  disorder,  present  many 
fundamental  and  exciting  possibilities  for  tailoring  optical  devices  [1,  4].  The  most  common 
defects that are created in graphene, during knock-on events, are the point vacancies which are 

 
 
    
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
caused by the breaking of the three C-C bonds and involve about 8 eV energy [11, 12]. Mending 
of the vacancies, as suggested by some DFT studies, can also take place [10]. Formation of di-
vacancies in graphene involve about 1eV more energy than the single vacancy [10].  

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique to probe graphene since the  states associated with 
sp2  bonds  display  significant  resonance  response  to  visible  range  photons  [1,  22-25].    For  the 
pristine graphene, Raman spectrum is dominated by the G band, of frequency 1582cm-1, which 
originates due to the in-plane stretching of sp2 atoms in the carbon-chains and rings. Introduction 
of point defects in graphene will scatter phonons, influencing the frequencies and asymmetries of 
the Raman allowed excitations. The disorder- activated Raman lines also appear in response to the 
impact.  The  D  (defect)  band,  at  the  frequency  of  1350  cm-1,  originates  due  to  the  breathing 
vibrations of the six membered C- rings in the presence of disorder [1, 23]. A second order process 
creates  2D  mode  with  the  conservation  of  momentum  of  two  photons  having  opposite  wave 
vectors.  This mode, seen at the frequency of 2600 cm-1, does not require any defect for activation 
[1, 23]. The ratio of Raman intensities of 2D and G bands are widely applied to distinguish single 
layer graphene (SLG) and multi- layer graphene (MLG).  Another disorder related D’ band [1, 23-
25]  originates  with  one  phonon  double  resonance  intra  valley  Raman  process  between  an  LO 
phonon, in the vicinity of  point, and a defect in the D’ band. Introduction of energetic ions in 
graphene  show  many  distinct  disorder  induced  structural  variations,  but  these  usually  involve 
increase of integral numbers of ions per area [5-9, 21], while the kinetic effects and the influence 
of energy of the bombarding species have received less attention [20]. Using molecular dynamic 
(MD) simulations, Abdol et al. have demonstrated the modulation in the interlayer linking between 
multilayer graphene sheets, with ion energy [21].   

Topological defects in graphene, like non hexagonal rings (NHR) of pentagons and heptagons, or 
their combinations, like Stone Wale (SW) defects with pair of pentagons and heptagons, are of 
great  interest  and  have  been  intensely  investigated  by  theoretical  methods    [1,11,12,14].  SW 
defects form due to the rotation of a C=C bond, which transforms the four adjacent hexagons into 
two pentagons and two heptagons [1, 10-14].  As these defects introduce only local disturbance, 
with no long-ranged effects and their numbers are small, they do not produce significant visible 
deformation and so their identification in TEM is also difficult [1, 13]. The NHR defects form via 
single bond rotation and can get easily incorporated in the graphene lattice [10]. Methods like ion 
irradiation,  chemical  treatment  and  high  temperature  quenching  are  likely  to  form  SW/NHR 
defects [1, 14]. These defects require a low free energy of formation (3.5 eV) compared to the 
mono-vacancy  or  di-vacancy  [1,  10-13].    Many  theoretical  studies,  using  first  principle 
calculations and DFT, have proposed characteristic Raman peaks for SW/NHR defects [11, 13, 
14]. Although such defects are prevalent in ion irradiated graphene, so far these defects have not 
been  observed  in  Raman  experiments.  One  of  the  reasons  is  their  weak  Raman  intensity, 
additionally, several of the signatures overlap with other prominent Raman bands, making their 
delineation hard. Shirodkar et al. have used the first principles analysis to show that the frequencies 
of  the  G  and  D  bands  get  effected  by  the  concentration  of  the  SW  defects  [12].    The  direct 
observation  of  SW/NHR  defects  by  Raman  spectroscopy  could  be  extremely  important  in 
fundamental studies of topological defects as well as for exploring their vibrational and dynamical 
aspects in graphene. 

 
 
 
In  the  present  study  we  utilize  Raman  spectroscopy  to  explore  the  evolution  of  vibrational 
properties of Single layer Graphene (SLG) and Multi-layer Graphene (MLG) after the introduction 
of  systematic  disorder,  through  irradiation  with  the  low  energy  Ar+  ions  of  100-300  eV  at  a 
constant fluence of 2.2 x 1014 ions/cm2. Significantly, a weak Raman band near1800-2200 cm-1 is 
observed in ion irradiated SLG and MLG. This is intriguing since theoretical studies, based on first 
principle calculations and DFT, have predicted a mode for topological NHR/SW defects in this 
range. However, this mode so far has not been observed or investigated in Raman experiments. 
Both  in  SLG  and  MLG,  this  Raman  band  is  very  broad  indicating  the  presence  of  multiple 
SW/NHR related modes, as also  suggested by  DFT studies.  The intensity behavior reflects  the 
annihilation of these defects at high energy. The evolution of G and 2D Raman bands, as well as 
defect activated D, D’ and G* has also been investigated with ion energy and reflects the presence 
of a transition  stage (Ts), beyond which sp3 content  rises and becomes a  dominant  component. 
Significance and correlation of the SW/NHR defects with ion energy presents some fascinating 
aspects. The direct observation and evolution of these topological defects in Raman experiments 
can provide very important knowledge for understanding topological defects in graphene. 

2. Experimental Section 

2.1 Sample preparation: 

Graphene  samples  were  utilized  as-received  from  Graphenea  (Spain).    Graphene  films  were 
implanted with Ar+ ions at normal incidence at room temperature under the vacuum of 5 x 10-6 
Torr. Ion implantation was carried out at several ion energies of 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 eV. 
During implantation, the fluence and the flux were kept constant at 2.2 x 1014 ions/cm2 and 3.7 x 
1012  ions/cm2.sec,  respectively.  In  order  to  obtain  a  uniform  implantation,  the  ion  beam  was 
scanned over the entire sample. The lowest ion energy used here is 100 eV. This was selected as 
it corresponds to the energy required for overcoming the C atom displacement barrier, without 
introducing any cascading effect [26].  

2.2 Characterization:  

The Raman measurements have been undertaken in the backscattering geometry on a T64000 triple 
monochromator (Horiba Jobin Yvon) having a resolution of 0.5 cm-1. The system is equipped with 
a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD detector. All the spectra presented here have been acquired with a 
514  nm  (2.41  eV)  laser  with  a  low  power  of  less  than  1  mW.  Raman  spectra  were  fitted  with 
Lorentzian profiles. 

XPS measurements were undertaken with an Al K source (1486.6 eV) in an ultra-high vacuum 
(UHV)  system  with  a  VG100AX  hemispherical  analyzer.  Spectra  were  acquired  at  a  normal 
photoelectron emission angle, with respect to the sample surface. The base pressure in the UHV 
system was maintained at better than 1 x 10-9 Torr. Surface morphology was investigated with a  
Nanoscope V (Bruker) Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). 

3. Results and Discussion:  

The Raman spectra of pristine as well as ion irradiated graphene are shown for MLG in Fig. 1.  
For the pristine MLG, G and 2D Raman modes are seen at 1583.5 and 2680.5 cm-1, respectively 

 
 
 
 
 
[1,  23],  while  a  tiny  D  mode  is  seen  at  1345  cm-1  which  is  attributed  to  the  presence  of  grain 
boundary and edges in graphene [1, 20, 22]. 

Figure 1: (a) Raman spectra after irradiation of graphene at various ion energies for MLG. The 
ion irradiation fluence was kept constant at 2.2 x 1014 ions/cm2. (b) Raman spectrum from MLG, 
after irradiation at 100 eV displaying deconvolution of the G and D’ modes. 

Ion  irradiation  primarily  introduces  vacancy  type  defects  which  induce  several  changes  in  the 
lattice (fig. 1). Most prominent among these are the decay of the 2D mode, and modifications in 
the G and D modes. In addition, some other important defect related modes are also observed that 
are weaker in intensity. After 100 eV irradiation, a minor D’ mode appears as a shoulder to the G 
band (fig. 1b).  Inclusion of defects contribute to  the phonon states with nonzero q momentum, 
leading to the modes like D and D’ which are not present in crystalline, defect free graphene [1, 4, 
5, 9, 23]. Near the 2D band, at a slightly lower frequency, a small G* band is present that originates 
via an inter valley double resonance (DR) process that involves two phonons near the K-point: an 
in-plane longitudinal acoustic (iLA) and in-plain transverse optical (iTO) phonon. Ion irradiation 
of SLG, which shows fabrication of quantum dots, also introduces many phonon defect states [4].

(black lines) and MLG (red lines). The ion irradiation fluence was kept constant at 2.2 x 1014 
ions/cm2. The shaded region (1800-2200 cm-1) shows SW/NHR defect related Raman in 
irradiated SLG and MLG.  Pristine is also shown for comparison and does not show SW/NHR 
defect (b) schematic of the SW/NHR defect (in red). 

  Popov  et  al.  have  presented  a  detailed  DFT  study,  based  upon  non-orthogonal  tight  binding 
model, predicting  several  Raman lines  (at  1346, 1524, 1595, 1740, 1927, and 2142 cm-1) as 
signatures of SW modes [11]. The structure of a SW defect is flat and these phonons originate 
due to the in-plane displacements. Among the six Raman excitations, the lower four originate from 
the displacements in heptagons, while the highest two by the pentagons. However, the Raman line 
at 2142 cm-1 was proposed as the most likely candidate, being the most intense and well separated 
mode, away from other prominent graphene excitations [11].  For topological non hexagonal rings 
(NHR), like pentagon and heptagon defects, and also SW defects, characteristic vibrational modes 
have  also  been  derived  using  an  empirical  bond  polarizability  model  [13].  Using  these  first 
principle calculations it was proposed that the pentagon defects will produce characteristic peaks 
above the G peak, in frequency range 1820-2000 cm-1, while the heptagon defects will introduce 
Raman  lines  below  the  G  mode.  Furthermore,  a  direct  correlation  of  the  number  of  pentagon 
defects with the intensity of the Raman peak was also suggested [13]. 

Remarkably, for the irradiated MLG, a very faint and broad Raman band is seen (in fig. 1) near 
2000 cm-1. Figure 2 shows a expanded section (from fig. 1) around this region. Also included here 
are the Raman spectra from ion irradiated SLG. Both SLG as well as MLG display a clear band in 
the frequency range 1800-2200 cm-1, after ion irradiation. This Raman excitation is not present in 
the pristine graphene and is only observed after irradiation, attributing it to the incorporation of 
defects in the lattice. Based on the first principle studies [11, 12, 13], this band can be attributed 
to  vibrational  modes  due  to  SW/NHR  defects.    Significantly  this  band  has  never  been 
experimentally probed or investigated, as far as we are aware, probably because its intensity is 
usually very weak, when compared to G, D or 2D Raman modes. This fact is also noted in first 

 
 
 
 
principle  studies  [11].  High  degradation  of  2D  mode,  after  irradiation  in  the  present  study,  is 
helpful in exposing the SW/NHR feature in SLG as well as MLG. 

In  the  following,  the  evolution  of  the  dominant  allowed  Raman  modes  (G  and  2D)  is  briefly 
discussed before presenting details of the disorder activated D, D’ and G* modes. We pay special 
attention to the evolution of the SW/NHR modes. The Raman intensity, position and the full width 
at half maxima (FWHM) have been derived from the Lorentzian fitting of the respective modes. 
As  the  G  and  D’  modes  nearly  overlap,  they  have  been  de-convoluted  (fig.  1b)  for  obtaining 
individual contributions [1, 24].  

3.1 Evolution of Raman G and 2D mode with ion energy 

Figure 3:  G mode (a) Intensity and (b) Position (inset shows FWHM). 2D mode (c) Intensity 
and (d) Position (inset shows FWHM). (e) Ratio of I2D/IG. Data is shown for SLG (black lines) 
and MLG (red lines) after implantation at various ion energies, fluence was kept constant at 2.2 
x 1014 ions/cm2.  

The evolution of the G and 2D modes, after ion impact display many important characteristics (fig. 
3). Several studies have investigated these modes with increasing ion fluence [1]. Here, the role of 
kinetic effects with increasing ion energy are emphasized, while the fluence was kept constant (2.2 
x 1014 ions/cm2). The evolution of the G mode intensity, for SLG and MLG with ion energy, (fig. 
3) displays two main trends: a mild increase initially which subsequently degrades with ion energy. 
Some ion energy induced effects in the intensities of G and D mode have been earlier investigated 
for  SLG  while  exploring  graphene  quantum  dots  [4].  The  higher  overall  G  intensity  of  MLG 
compared to SLG (in fig. 3) reflects its higher damage resistant nature. This is due to the fact that 
the Van der Waals interactions among multiple layers provide a greater rigidity against degradation 
[6]. Although the absolute numbers in intensity are arbitrary, the degradation initiates in the range 
of 100-150 eV, for both SLG and MLG. This is also compounded by an intense hardening of the 
mode due to the inclusion of compressive forces and structural distortions. Beyond 100eV in SLG 

 
 
 
 
 
 
and 150 eV in MLG, the mode consistently declines and only very mild hardening (in fig. 3b) is 
seen. This suggests  the presence of  a  transition  stage  between 100 and 150 eV  (shown as blue 
shaded region and labelled as Ts). Role of penetration depth is distinctly depicted by the FWHM, 
which is influenced differently by the number of layers: changing nearly linearly with energy for 
single  layer  but  not  showing  much  variation  above  Ts  in  multi-layers.  Quantum  confinement 
effects due to the creation of graphene quantum dots can also induce widening [4]. At the highest 
(300 eV) impact energy, all the effects appear nearly independent of the number of layers. DFT 
studies indicate G-mode softening due to SW/NHR defects [12]. Presence of such defects here, as 
discussed in following sections, may also contribute to the decreased hardening beyond 150 eV 
(>Ts).   

The high intensity of the 2D band (fig. 3c) as well as high I2D/IG ratios of 2.8 and 1.2 for pristine 
SLG  and  MLG,  respectively,  confirms  the  existence  of  good  quality  single  and  multi-layer 
graphene [1, 23]. Ion impact causes a swift degradation of the 2D mode, even with just 100 eV 
irradiation. The mode exhibits hardening and broadening which increase with energy (Fig. 3d). 
The mode nearly vanishes at 200 eV and 250 eV, for single layer and multi-layers, respectively. 
The  FWHM  of  the  2D  mode  in  MLG  is  broader  in  pristine  (30  cm-1)  but  is  less  effected  with 
energy. 

3.2 Evolution of Defect related Raman D and D’ modes with ion energy: 

Figure 4: D mode (a) Intensity, (b) Position (inset FWHM) and (c) Ratio ID/IG. D’ mode (d) 
Intensity, (e) Position (inset FWHM) and (f) Ratio ID/ID’. Data is shown for SLG (black lines) and 
MLG (red lines) after implantation at various ion energies, fluence was kept constant at 2.2 x 
1014 ions/cm2. 

Both SLG and MLG display an initial increase in the disorder D mode intensity when impacted 
with  ions.  The  intensity  rises  up  to  100  and  150  eV,  respectively,  in  SLG  and  MLG  while  it 
declines subsequently (fig. 4). The initial increase reflects the inclusion of vacancies and disorder 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
in  the  lattice  [1,  23].  At  energies  higher  than  150  eV  (>Ts),  some  deconstruction  of  the  six-
membered  carbon–rings  into  lower  ordered  rings,  or  their  clusters,  can  contribute  to  the 
degradation  of this mode  [5, 7]. The influence of ion  energy is  also  indicated by the increased 
FWHM  broadening  which,  however,  is  not  affected  by  the  number  of  layers.  Observed  at  the 
positions 1345 and 1350 cm-1 in pristine SLG and MLG, respectively, this mode does not shift 
much  initially,  but  displays  hardening  at  higher  energies  above  Ts,  indicating  severe  lattice 
distortions in the C-rings. These results are in contrast to the fluence dependent studies performed 
with  90  eV  ions  [5],  where  no  change  in  the  peak  frequency  was  observed,  even  after 
amorphization at the fluence of 1 x 1015 ions/cm2.  This demonstrates the significant role of the 
ion energy and the associated kinetic effects in understanding the lattice evolution with disorder, 
and emphasizes that fluence variation alone, as is the case in most of the earlier studies, does not 
capture the full scenario. The presence of grain boundary edges as well as SW/NHR defects can 
also  influence  the D mode. DFT results  have shown a nearly two-fold increase in  the  D mode 
intensity near the carbon nanotube edges that are rich in such defects [10]. Hardening  of the D 
mode, in the presence of SW defects, has also been reported [12]. 

The ratio ID/IG displays a nearly similar rising nature for SLG and MLG suggesting an increase in 
ion  induced  disorder  in  the  lattice  with  ion  energy  (fig.  4c).    The  ratio  for  MLG  at  100  eV 
corresponds well with the earlier study where single energy (90 eV) for Ar ions at various fluences 
was used [6]. The ion energy induced effects on ID/IG in SLG have been discussed earlier [4]. Here 
the  comparison  with  MLG,  however,  indicates  a  usually  higher  ID/IG  for  SLG  (fig.  4c). 
Investigating SLG alone, Ahlberg et al. observed a nearly constant ratio (~ 1.1) after irradiation at 
100 and 200 eV, the energy investigated in [20]. Not only this ratio is almost twice at these energies 
here (fig. 4c), it overall increases with ion energy exhibiting kinetic effects. The destruction of the 
sp2 rings, during ion impact, contributes to the formation of damaged zones. Aggregation of such 
damaged areas decreases the crystallite size and leads to the increase in the ID/IG ratio. During this 
process, sp3 amorphous content also enhances and at some stage amorphization occurs. Decline in 
ratio at 300 eV for SLG reflects this stage of amorphization [4, 5, 7, 9], as also suggested by the 
softening  of the D mode seen here (fig.  4a). AFM and XPS results, presented in  the following 
sections reflect  the aggregation of the damage as well as the formation  of sp3  defects  after ion 
irradiation.   

The D’ band is also a disorder related mode and is absent in pristine. It is observed in ion irradiated 
SLG as well as MLG, being most  intense at 100 and 150 eV, respectively. Its position and the 
width do not indicate much variation. It has been proposed that ID/ID’ is sensitive to the type of 
defects present in the lattice [24, 25] with ratios of 3.5, 7 and 13 suggesting edge defects, vacancies 
and sp3 defects, respectively [25]. The ratio ID/ID’ is shown for SLG as well as MLG (fig. 4f) and 
vacancy  type  defects  appear  to  be  prevalent  in  the  energy  range  of  100-150  eV,  while  sp3 
hybridized carbon networks are dominating in 200-250 eV regime. These observations, overall in 
concurrence  with  the  ID/IG  ratio  reflect  a  similar  scenario  for  single  and  multilayer  graphene. 
However, a very high ID/ID’ value (~15) but reasonably lower ID/IG (~2) in MLG, at 250 eV energy, 
suggests that more studies in this regard are needed. 
The positional shifts of Raman modes show some interesting character due to the kinetic effects. 
The G mode undergoes a distinct blue shift (Fig. 3b), within 100-150eV energy range, while the 
D mode gets only mildly affected (Fig. 4b). On the other hand, this situation gets reversed above 
150 eV; with  the G mode  getting  less  influenced than the D mode.  With C-C stretching being 

 
 
responsible for the origin of G mode whereas breathing of six-membered rings leading to the D 
mode activation, it appears that initially at lower energies, modifications primarily influence the 
stretching  mode,  whereas  at  higher  irradiation  energies  (>Ts  ),  C-ring  breathing  modes  get 
significantly distorted. Formation of shorter and stiffer C-C bonds in SW defects can also produce 
softer G and harder D modes [11, 12]. Compared to the D mode, the D’ mode does not show much 
positional variation. 

3.3 Evolution of SW/NHR and G* mode with ion energy: 

Figure 5: SW/NHR mode (a) Intensity, (b) Position (inset FWHM) and (c) Ratio ISW/NHR/IG. G* 
mode (d) Intensity, (e) Position (inset FWHM) and (f) Ratio IG*/IG. Data is shown for SLG and 
MLG after implantation at various ion energies, fluence was kept constant at 2.2 x 1014 ions/cm2.   

Figure 5 presents the evolution of SW/NHR band, seen in the frequency range 1800-2200 cm-1 (in 
fig.  2)  for  ion  irradiated  SLG  and  MLG.  According  to  the  molecular  dynamic  simulations, 
formation  of  NHR  defects  takes  place  via  the  transformation  of  vacancy  defects,  during  the 
saturation of dangling bonds [10]. Due to the linkage and Van-der Waals interactions between the 
layers  [21],  it  will  be  more  difficult  to  initiate  bond  rotations  in  MLG,  necessary  for  forming 
SW/NHR defects. This can explain the much lower SW/NHR defect intensity at 100 eV in MLG, 
compared  to  SLG.  The  intensity  behavior,  with  ion  energy,  is  also  very  different  for  SLG  and 
MLG. Observed first after 100 eV irradiation, the intensity systematically decays with increasing 
energy in SLG. On the other hand in MLG, the intensity rises up to 250 eV and declines only at 
the  highest  energy  of  300  eV  (fig.  5a).  Kinetic  Monte  Carlo  simulations  have  suggested  the 
migration of embedded pentagonal rings within the graphene layer as well as on its edges [27]. 
Further,  such  diffusing  non  hexagonal  rings  can  transform  into  six-membered  rings,  through 
isomerization at the graphene edges [27]. Enhanced SW/NHR defect migration, with increasing 

  
 
 
 
 
ion energy, and their subsequent annihilation, by getting transformed into hexagonal rings, may 
be responsible for the declining intensity in SLG (fig. 5a). In contrast, as the migration of SW/NHR 
defects will be more restrictive in MLG due to the interlayer interactions, the decay appears to be 
significant  only  at  the  highest  energy.  The  overall  positional  variations  of  SW/NHR  mode  are 
nearly similar in SLG and MLG, with a hardening at low energies and a subsequent mild softening. 
The large bandwidth of this mode suggests presence of more than one SW/NHR mode within the 
band (shaded region of fig. 2), in support of earlier DFT studies [11, 13]. Higher resolution Raman 
measurements will be necessary to resolve these components. Although the width in MLG does 
not change much, with ion energy, it reduces significantly in SLG at higher ion energies. At the 
highest energy the SW/NHR mode is absent in SLG while it is very weak in MLG. The variation 
in ratio ISW/NHR/IG with ion energy (fig. 5c) is small at low energies, both for SLG and MLG, but 
displays a mild rise above 200 eV. Domination of sp3 defects will affect the presence of SW/NHR 
defects  at  this  stage.  Many  more  studies  of  this  topological  SW/NHR  mode  will  be  needed  to 
elucidate the rich characteristics.   

The intensity of G* mode rapidly declines with energy, showing a very different behavior than 
SW/NHR defect in SLG and MLG. The associated initial hardening but subsequent softening, as 
well  as  the  broadening  of  G*  are  presented  in  Fig.  5.  These  also  exhibit  very  different  nature 
compared to the SW/NHR mode. The ratio IG*/IG usually remains low.  

3.4 Electronic Structure and Morphology 

Figure 6: C (1s) core level spectra for pristine and after irradiation with 150 eV ions.  Ion fluence 
was kept constant at 2.2 x 1014 ions/cm2. 

XPS  measurements  have  been  utilized  to  understand  the  modifications  in  the  chemical  species 
after ion irradiation. The C (1s) core level has been investigated (fig. 6) to study the presence of 
sp2 and sp3 bonded carbon species as well as the existence of any oxygen functional groups on the 
graphene  surface.  The  pristine  graphene  exhibits  an  intense  sp2  feature  corresponding  to  C=C 

 
 
 
 
 
 
(284.8 eV) denoting the presence of good graphene layer. In addition, components related to C-
OH,  C-O  and  C=O  are  also  observed  at  285.7,  286.6  and  287.5  eV,  respectively  [28].  After 
irradiation, a new feature is noticed at 285.5 eV and is shown in Fig.6 for 150 eV ion energy. This 
feature is assigned to the C-C sp3 defects, created due to the damage in sp2 bonded carbon-rings 
[29]. 

Figure 7:  High resolution 200 x 200 nm2 AFM image from graphene after irradiation with (a) 
100 eV (b) 150 eV (c) 200 eV and (d) 300 eV.  Ion fluence was kept constant at 2.2 x 1014 
ions/cm2. 

AFM images present the surface morphology of the ion irradiated graphene. After irradiation at 
100 eV (fig. 7a), several weak protrusions attributed to the defects can be seen. Similar hillocks 
have been observed by Lucchese et al. in [5] where a single ion energy of 90 eV Ar+ was used. 
The disorder can be attributed to the formation of sp3 regions and distortions in the sp2 rings [30].  
After 150 eV irradiation, in addition to the increase in their density, the defects appear well defined 
and larger (fig. 7b). As some defects now overlap, the size of the undamaged graphene reduces. 
This results in the decay of the G and D Raman modes (fig. 3 and 4). While the dimensions of the 
sp2  crystallite  diminish,  the  ID/IG  ratio  in  Raman  rises.  Phenomenological  studies  on  nano-
crystalline graphite have also indicated this inverse relationship between ID/IG and the crystallite 
dimensions [4, 5]. Drastic enhancement in the size of defects along with a significant coalescence 
of disorder occurs at 300 eV irradiation. This can induce high sp3 content in the lattice, as suggested 
by fig. 4 (c and f). 

4. Conclusion: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The present work illustrates the role of kinetic effects of ion irradiation energy (100-300 eV) on 
the  vibrational  response  of  the  single  layer  and  multilayer  graphene.  It  is  fascinating  that  the 
vibrational Raman response also exhibits the presence of topological non hexagonal ring/Stone 
Wale  defects  (NHR/SW)  in  the  frequency  range  of  1800-2200  cm-1.  Such  modes  have  been 
predicted by theoretical methods, however, as far as we are aware, these have never been probed 
by Raman experiments. The wide FWHM of NHR/SW defects demonstrates the presence of more 
than one frequency component, as proposed by earlier DFT studies. The decay in their intensity, 
at  higher  energies,  reflects  the  transformation  of  these  defects  into  six-membered  rings.  The 
evolution of G, 2D as well as disorder related D, D’ and G* modes has also been investigated. 
These  indicate  the  presence  of  a  transition  stage  in  100-150  eV  energy  range.  Several  crucial 
modifications occur, beyond this transition stage, due to the increase in sp3 content in the lattice. 
The evolution of these other Raman modes, G, 2D, D, D’ and G*, in correlation with NHR/SW 
defects provide a rich picture of the role of ion energy. The direct observation of a NHR/SW mode 
by  Raman  experiment  can  be  significant  in  fundamental  fashion  for  the  study  of  Topological 
defects  in  graphene  as  well  as  for  understanding  the  physics  and  chemistry  of  the  topological 
defects in general.
