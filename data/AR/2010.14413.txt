Abstract There is no list of bipolar active regions (ARs) with reverse polarity
(anti-Hale regions), although statistical investigations of such ARs (bearing the
imprint of deep subphotospheric processes) are important for understanding
solar-cycle mechanisms. We studied 8606 ARs from 1 January 1989 to 31 De-
cember 2018 to detect anti-Hale regions and to compile a catalog. The Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)
data, as well as the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data, the Mount Wilson Ob-
servatory catalog and drawings, and the USAF/NOAA Solar Region Summary
were used. Complex, ambiguous cases related to anti-Hale region identiﬁcation
were analyzed. Two basic and four additional criteria to identify an AR as an
anti-Hale region were formulated. The basic criteria assume that: i) dominating
features of an AR have to form a bipole of reverse polarity with sunspots/pores

of both polarities being present; ii) magnetic connections between the opposite
polarities has to be observed. A catalog of anti-Hale regions (275 ARs) is com-
piled. The catalog contains: NOAA number, date of the greatest total area of
sunspots, coordinates, and corrected sunspot area for this date. The tilt and
the most complex achieved Mount Wilson magnetic class are also provided.
The percentage of anti-Hale groups meeting the proposed criteria is ≈3.0 %
from all studied ARs, which is close to early estimations by authors who had
examined each AR individually: ≈2.4 % by Hale and Nicholson ( Astrophys.
J. 62, 270, 1925) and ≈3.1 % by Richardson ( Astrophys. J. 107, 78, 1948).
The enchancement of the anti-Hale percentage in later research might be re-
lated to: i) increasing sensitivity of instruments (considering smaller and smaller
bipoles); ii) the ambiguities in the anti-Hale region identiﬁcation. The catalog
is available as the Electronic Supplementary Material and at the CrAO website
(sun.crao.ru/databases/catalog-anti-hale/).

1. Introduction

The majority of active regions (ARs) obey the empirical rules for sunspot groups
(Hale et al., 1919): Hale’s polarity law, Joy’s law, etc. (regular ARs). The pioneer-
ing models of the magnetic cycle (Parker, 1955; Babcock, 1961; Leighton, 1964),
as well as the global mean-ﬁeld dynamo theory (see, e.g., Moﬀatt, 1978; Krause
and R¨adler, 1980), explain well the existance of the regular ARs. However, ARs
violating these empirical rules also occur. According to Hale’s law during an even
(odd) sunspot cycle, the leading sunspot of a bipolar AR has negative (positive)
polarity in the northern hemisphere and the situation is reversed in the southern
hemisphere. A sketch of regular ARs of even (odd) cycles is presented as Figure 1.
In this article, we deal with bipole sunspot groups with the reverse polarity
(anti-Hale regions). We do not consider here other types of irregularities.

Anti-Hale ARs bear the imprint of deep subphotospheric processes. So, statis-
tical studies of these ARs may shed light on our understanding of solar magnetic-
ﬁeld evolution and solar-cycle mechanisms. For instance, Sokoloﬀ, Khlystova,
and Abramenko (2015) found that a contribution of small-scale ﬂuctuation dy-
namo in the interplay with the global dynamo is more pronounced at solar-cycle

minimum. The authors came to this conclusion based on their probabilistic
model and the revealed enhancement of the relative number of anti-Hale regions
during solar minimum. Note that the presence of magnetic-ﬁeld ﬂuctuations on
smaller (as compared to the mean-ﬁeld) scales was earlier predicted by both
the turbulent dynamo theory (e.g. Kraichnan and Nagarajan, 1967; Kazantsev,
1968; Zeldovich, Ruzmaikin, and Sokoloﬀ, 1990; Brandenburg and Subramanian,
2005) and direct numerical simulations (e.g. Blackman and Field, 2002; R¨adler,
Kleeorin, and Rogachevskii, 2003; Sur, Brandenburg, and Subramanian, 2008;
Brandenburg, Sokoloﬀ, and Subramanian, 2012). The decay of anti-Hale ARs
can explain the weakening of the polar magnetic ﬁeld: the transport of remnants
of the following parts of anti-Hale regions to the poles causes the decrease of the
polar ﬁeld (Mordvinov and Kitchatinov, 2019). Numerical simulations by Hazra,
Choudhuri, and Miesch (2017) show that the high-latitude anti-Hale ARs in the
middle phase of a cycle must contribute to weakening of the polar ﬁeld more
than the rest of anti-Hale groups. Jiang, Cameron, and Sch¨ussler (2015) also
found that the magnetic-ﬂux advection through the Equator due to decay of
anti-Hale ARs causes the weakening of the process of the polar-ﬁeld recovery.
Determination of the magnetic twist and writhe for several ARs attributed as
anti-Hale regions allowed L´opez Fuentes et al. (2000, 2003) to estimate the
degree of inﬂuence of various mechanisms (kink-instability, eﬀect of the Coriolis
force, etc.) on the deformation of ﬂux-tubes. Thus, the observational data on
the statistics and properties of anti-Hale groups is in high demand in the solar
physics community.

Unfortunately, there is no reliable database of anti-Hale regions. Although
many catalogs provide information on the polarity of leading and following parts
of ARs and use this information (for example, to measure the tilt of the sunspot-
group axis), the catalogs do not provide these data explicitly. The Mount Wilson
Observatory (MWO) catalog had been a main data source on the anti-Hale ARs
for a long time. The catalog had been replenished irregularly since 1920. The data
are available digitally since 1962. From 1989 to 2004 the ARs of reverse polarity
are marked with the sign “+”. According to many researchers who examined the
catalog, some ARs in the catalog are marked with this sign erroneously. Thus,
Hale and Nicholson (1925) viewed a lot of AR drawings to verify the magnetic
class detected by MWO operators. Richardson (1948) reported checking each AR
of reverse polarity from the MWO catalog based on the initial records. Errors
in anti-Hale region identiﬁcation in the MWO catalog were also revealed by
Sokoloﬀ, Khlystova, and Abramenko (2015).

The published estimation of the relative number of anti-Hale regions varies
within a rather wide range: from a few percent to approximately (8 – 9)%. Hale
and Nicholson (1925) found that <6 (2.4 on average) of all ARs are the reverse-
polarity groups with simple bipolar magnetic conﬁguration. Later the following
results for this parameter were reported: 3.1 (Richardson, 1948), <5 (Smith and
Howard, 1968), 1.8 (Vitinsky, 1986), 4 (Wang and Sheeley, 1989); 4.9 (Khlystova
and Sokoloﬀ, 2009, Sokoloﬀ and Khlystova, 2010), 4 (Stenﬂo and Kosovichev,
2012), ≈8 (Li and Ulrich, 2012; McClintock, Norton, and Li, 2014; Li, 2018).
Note that only part of these studies were performed on the basis of the MWO
catalog. Many authors used their own databases. McClintock, Norton, and Li

A.V. Zhukova et al.

(2014) suggested that the inhomogeneity of the data used might be the reason
for such a discrepancy in the results of various authors. The size of included
ARs is one of the main reasons for discrepancy, because small sunspot groups
are prone to violate the Hale’s polarity law more frequently (Richardson, 1948;
Howard, 1989; Stenﬂo and Kosovichev, 2012). Only ≈60 % of ephemeral regions
obey this law (Hagenaar, 2001). Moreover, the smallest quiet-Sun bipoles are
randomly oriented (Tlatov, Vasil’eva, and Pevtsov, 2010).

Errors in the identiﬁcation of anti-Hale regions also occure. For example,
there is an obvious diﬀerence in numbers and coordinates of anti-Hale ARs on the
time–latitude diagrams reported by Richardson (1948) and by Vitinsky (1986) in
spite of the fact that the authors used the same database. The known reasons for
anti-Hale region misidentiﬁcation are: i) erroneous detection of ARs boundaries
(Sokoloﬀ, Khlystova, and Abramenko, 2015); ii) the wrong distribution of ARs
between cycles during the transition from one solar cycle to anoter; iii) the
misalignment between the magnetic and the heliographic Equators. The two
latter reasons are discussed by McClintock, Norton, and Li (2014).

When compiling a database for further identiﬁcation of anti-Hale regions, the
type of the source data (magnetograms, drawings, etc.) is also important. Thus,
Stenﬂo and Kosovichev (2012) reported about the objective diﬃculties in auto-
matic detection of individual sunspot groups from full-disk magnetograms and
extraction of single ARs. Besides, inaccuracies related to detection of weighted
centers of polarities may also produce errors. Wang et al. (2015) revealed that
white-light measurements generally underestimate the tilts (axial inclinations)
of ARs, even when the leading- and the following-polarity sectors are identiﬁed
correctly.

To summarize, studies of anti-Hale regions are essential for understanding the
solar dynamo. So far, there is no reliable list of ARs with reverse polarity. We
undertake a compilation of such a database starting from 1989 and covering the
last two and a half solar cycles. We paid special attention to the analysis of
mistakes and ambiguities in identiﬁcation of anti-Hale ARs.

2. Data and Method

2.1. Data Sources

To examine ARs visually, we used the full-solar-disk daily data: magnetograms,
continuum and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images, sketches and drawings, as
well as diﬀerent images of the individual ARs. We also used available catalogs
containing the information on the leading sunspot polarity of bipolar ARs and
other necessary data. We used the following sources:

– the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI: Scherrer et al., 1995) and the Extreme
Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT: Moses et al., 1997) on board the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO);

– the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI: Scherrer et al., 2012) and the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA: Lemen et al., 2012) onboard the Solar
Dynamic Observatory (SDO);

Greenwich – USAF/NOAA Sunspot Data provided by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA). But these data are available only until Oc-
tober 2016 (solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwch.shtml), and later we restricted
ourselves to the USAF/NOAA SRS database.

2.2. Ambiguities in Anti-Hale Region Identiﬁcation

We encountered the following ambiguities in anti-Hale AR identiﬁcation.

i) During solar-cycle minima the high-latitude sunspot groups (new-cycle
precursors) might be erroneously accepted as reverse-polarity ARs. The periods
of this ambiguity are 1996 and 2008 (the cycle minima). To determine what
cycle a suspicious high-latitude group belongs to, we used a technique suggested
by McClintock, Norton, and Li (2014). The boundaries between cycles in North
and South hemispheres were deﬁned as:

60 × ylat = ±(xdate − xint),

(1)

where ylat is latitude, xdate is a function of a number of days from 1 January
1974, and xint (a point of inter section at the Equator) was visually determined
separately for the best ﬁt for each cycle. The time–latitude diagram based on the
USAF/NOAA SRS sunspot-group data is presented as Figure 2. Cycle bound-
aries for Solar Cycles 22/23 and 23/24 are plotted from McClintock, Norton,
and Li (2014) data. We also plotted here the ﬁt of the boundary between Solar
Cycles 24 and 25. This boundary might be slightly changed with Solar Cycle 25
evolution.

ii) Detection of individual sunspot groups in large composite activity com-
plexes represents a challenge. Stenﬂo and Kosovichev (2012) supposed that it
does not seem feasible to make a program that can automatically and reliably
identify all of the bipolar regions. Blocks and chains of ARs are typical for solar
maxima. In that and some other cases sunspots/pores may be attributed with

equal probability to several adjacent groups. Diﬀerences in segmentation of a
magnetic complex by various tools is illustrated in Figure 3. We assumed that
there are no anti-Hale sub-regions in this particular case.

iii) Phenomena in ARs in the late decaying stage when the following spots of

an AR have vanished or weakened:

a) Presence of opposite polarity small sunspots/pores to the West of an old
leading sunspot. To illustrate, an example of a large decaying AR is shown in
Figure 4. Magnetic connections between a large leading spot of positive polarity
and fragmented pores of negative polarity to the East are evident and steady
(panels c, f). Such magnetic loops is the typical connection of the leading and the
following parts of bipolar ARs. The absense of a magnetic connection between
the large leading spot and a negative polarity pore to the South-West does not
allow us to identify this couple of sunspots as a single AR with reverse polarity.

images; the same images of this sunspot group on 07 July (d, e, f): two separate ARs (NOAA
8620 and 8624) are assigned. A part of the mafgnetic structure assigned as NOAA 8620 on
panel (f) is not a true anti-Hale AR because there is no magnetic connection between sunspots.

Note, however, that this couple of sunspots is assigned by Helioviewer as an
individual AR NOAA 8620 on 07, 09 July 1999 and further; the following part
of the initial sunspot group is extracted by Helioviewer as AR NOAA 8624. Such
situation is typical for an AR with complex magnetic conﬁguration (classiﬁed
“γ” in the Mount Wilson class).

Moving magnetic features might also cause emerging of pores on moat–cell

boundaries (Ryutova, 2018). The combination of the old leading spot and
opposite-polarity small spot/pore to the West of it may be misidentiﬁed as a
separate sunspot group violating Hale’s polarity law (Figure 5), especially by
automatic algorithms.

b) Presence of opposite polarity pores all around the old sunspot. In cases
when the ﬂux (area) weighted center of scattered pores is located to the West of
the old spot, the AR also might be erroneously identiﬁed as an anti-Hale region.

We did not include the above mentioned cases in the compiled catalog.
iv) Tilt instability of emerging ARs. The tilt is known to be unstable during
several days after the emergence onset (see, e.g., van Driel-Gesztelyi and Green,
2015; Schunker et al., 2020) and may change the orientation importantly. One
cannot determine the leading/following sunspot position and polarity unambigu-
ously while the tilt is not stabilized. So, it is a challenge to establish a reverse
polarity for the groups arising in the close proximity to the western limb, as well
as for small short-lived ARs. We discarded ARs emerging near the western limb
and observed only for one or two days. All short-lived ARs (having spots/pores

of both polarities for less than three days) and ARs with tilt uncertainties were
indicated with special marks: “S” and “T”, respectively (see Section 3.2).

v) Emergence of a new reverse-polarity bipole close to a pre-existing unipolar
sunspot. Sometimes such new bipoles have an individual NOAA number, e.g.
ARs NOAA 7062 close to 7056, and sometimes they do not. We extracted the
new anti-Hale region from the whole activity complex (in the latter case, under
the hosting NOAA number). In the catalog, they are marked by “X”. A typical
example is shown in Figure 6. This procedure was applied only for emerging anti-
Hale regions that survived longer than three days. Sunspot areas for extracted
ARs were calculated by using a technique described in Section 3.2.

vi) ARs changing their properties during the displacement across the disk.
Some ARs, when passing across the disk, show anti-Hale properties for only a
part of time. It may be due to emergence of a new magnetic ﬂux in the vicinity.
In other cases, a bipolar sunspot group with reverse-polarity remains after the
decay of a multipolar AR. If the reverse-polarity property is observed longer
than three days, we noted this region with a special mark “P”.

Fe ix/x 171 ˚A line (c) images. The “δ-sunspot” of reverse polarity was extracted and considered
in the compiled catalog.

(c)

vii) ARs with the main spots of both polarities near the Equator. McClintock,
Norton, and Li (2014) argue that equatorial location of sunspot groups is related
to a misalignment of the magnetic and heliographic Equators. They suppose that
ARs such as NOAA 11987, for example, pertain to the magnetic system of the
North hemisphere despite the fact that the leading spot is located a bit below
the Equator. The authors explain such phenomena by the diﬀerent degree of
activity of the North and South hemispheres. Considering these reasons, we
included into the catalog only those near-Equator ARs where the area-weighted
center and the midpoint between the main spots of both polarities belong to the
same hemisphere. They are marked with a letter “E”.

viii) ARs with “δ-conﬁguration”. This class of ARs was introduced for sunspot
groups with closely spaced opposite-polarity umbrae located in the common
penumbra and added to the initial Mount Wilson magnetic classiﬁcation by
K¨unzel (1965). A sample of AR NOAA 9591 including “δ-sunspot” is presented
as Figure 7. Individual “δ-structures” with reverse polarity were included in
our database with the mark “D”. “δ-spots” amidst the spread out background
magnetic complex (see Figure 7) were extracted and considered only in the cases
when such a “δ-structure” was the strongest feature in the entire complex. In
case the extracted “δ-structure” displays the reverse polarity, we indicated it
with the mark “W”. There are only seven such events in the compiled catalog.
ix) Multipolar ARs. A sample of such AR (NOAA 10069) is shown in Figure 8:
a number of equivalent-by-size sunspots of both polarities are spread around
without forming any single bipole. Sometimes the most western spots may have
the wrong polarity according to the Hale’s polarity law, see Figure 8. In spite of
this attribute, we decided not to count multipolar ARs in out dataset. Examples
of multipolar ARs are: NOAA 6562, 6624, 10501, 10786, and 12673.

x) The polarity of sunspots may be reversed due to the projection eﬀect. Of

course, such cases were not counted.

2.3. Shortcomings in the Existing Data Sources

We also encountered issues related to data sources.

i) Flaws of the MWO data:
a) Lack of records (e.g. ARs NOAA 7926, 9858, and 10268) because of diﬀerent
reasons, including weather conditions (e.g. ARs NOAA 6255, 7430,7872, and
8963).

b) Wrong determination of the magnetic-ﬁeld polarity (all sunspots/pores of
a bipolar AR are marked as the same polarity features, e.g. ARs NOAA 8023,
9470, and 9699). Wang et al. (2015) also reports that such cases are multiple
among ARs with the polar separation less than 2.5 degrees.

c) Erroneous usage or lack of the mark “REV. POL.” (reversed polarity)
on MWO drawings. A sample of an AR with proper polarity of the leading
sunspot, but wrongly marked as “REV. POL.” is presented in Figure 9. The
magnetogram and the continuum image have the usual EW-orientation whereas
the MWO drawing has the opposite orientation. The main spot R20 has a regular
(for leading spots in Solar Cycle 23 in the North hemisphere) positive polarity,
but the AR is marked as “REV. POL.”. The opposite situation is observed in
the MWO catalog for the anti-Hale ARs NOAA 5622, 7741, 7948, 8210, 9045,
9736, and 10638, which are not marked as reverse-polarity ARs.

d) Lack of AR NOAA number.
ii) Uncertainties in AR NOAA assignement in the DPD, the USAF/NOAA

SRS databases, Solar Monitor, and Helioviewer:

a) After the decay of an AR, the same NOAA number was assigned to a new
anti-Hale region that emerged at the same location (e.g. ARs NOAA 6241, 7324)
or nearby (e.g. AR NOAA 7062);

Solar Physics A catalog of anti-Hale ARs

b) Diﬀerences in outlining of boundaries (areas) of ARs in the USAF/NOAA
SRS and the DPD databases. For example, according to the DPD, the anti-Hale
AR NOAA 12310 is a single active region. But according to the USAF/NOAA
SRS and Solar Monitor, this complex is fragmented into three diﬀerent ARs
(NOAA 12310, 12312, and 12313). Another example: AR NOAA 6203 is classiﬁed
as a single group on the DPD sketch, and as two separate ARs (including the
anti-Hale bipolar group MWO number 26212) on the MWO drawing.

ARs with such ambiguities in various databases were indicated with mark

“N”.

iii) Errors in calculations of sunspot-group areas. For instance, in the

USAF/NOAA SRS database on 13 July 1994 AR NOAA 7746 has an extremely
high value of the group area, which triply exceeds that reported for previous and
following days. At the same time, the DPD data show a smooth change of this
value.

To this end, to provide a database of anti-Hale regions without the aforemen-

tioned shortcomings, we examined anew all ARs from 1989 to 2018.

3. The Compiled Catalog

3.1. Anti-Hale Regions Selection Criteria

When elaborating our criteria of identiﬁcation of anti-Hale regions, we were
guided by original ideas by Hale and Nicholson (1925). We also assumed that
the main spots of diﬀerent polarities are footpoints of emerged magnetic loops
in accordance with classic magnetic-cycle models (Babcock, 1961; Parker, 1955).
Following this, we formulated two basic criteria for identiﬁcation of an AR as an
anti-Hale region.

i) Dominating features of an AR form a bipole of reverse polarity with sunspots

or pores of both polarities being present.

ii) Magnetic connections between the opposite polarities are steady: magnetic
loops (arcades) are visible at least in one of the EUV images day by day (in
the cases when EUV data are available).
The remaining four additional criteria are proposed for certain ambiguous
types of ARs.

iii) For small, short-lived (less than three days) sunspot groups. The tilt of an
AR has to be stable (not rotating, not perpendicular to the Equator). The
rotation of the tilt more than 20 degrees during the interval of observation
was considered as a non-stable tilt. The area of an AR must be greater than 4
µHem and the corrected umbra area by the DPD must be non-zero (to exclude
ambiguous pores: “transient” and “penumbrae without umbrae” features, see
Lefevre and Clette 2014).

iv) For sunspot groups located on the Equator. Both the area-weighted center
and the midpoint between the polarities of an AR have to be located in the
same (the North or South) hemisphere.

v) For emerging bipolar groups appearing from a pre-existing AR. The extracted

bipole has to exist at least three days.

vi) For “δ-structures” amidst the background magnetic complex. The extracted
“δ-structure” has to form the strongest feature in the magnetic complex and
does not have steady magnetic connections with other magnetic centers of
the complex.

We did not consider any unipolar sunspots. We also did not consider multi-

polar ARs.

3.2. Anti-Hale Database and Special Marks

All detected anti-Hale ARs are listed in the database (see the Electronic Supple-
mentary Material). Several lines from the catalog beginning, as well as the two
last lines of the catalog are shown as Table 1. For each AR, the catalog includes
three information blocks: i) the USAF/NOAA SRS data; ii) the DPD data;
iii) our special marks. The ﬁrst and second blocks each include the following
parameters: the NOAA (or DPD) number; the date of the greatest corrected
total area of sunspots in D M Y (day, month, year) format. For this date, we
show: latitude (LAT), longitude (LON), the maximum value of the corrected
total sunspots area (Area). Area values are provided in millionths of the solar
hemisphere (µHem).

The most complex Mount Wilson magnetic class (Hale class) achieved by a
given AR is also shown in the USAF/NOAA SRS data block. When the Mount
Wilson magnetic class was not available, we assigned this class. For ARs that
exhibit the anti-Hale behaviour only for a partial time during the evolution, we
considered only the anti-Hale period to determine the Mount Wilson magnetic
class.

The DPD block contains the tilt information for the ARs studied. Unfortu-
nately, there is a lack of tilt data from 2014 to 2018 in the DPD database (except
for some months in 2017). The sign “z” stands for missing data. The data on
the recurrent ARs are provided in the catalog for each rotation separately.

We use the following special marks for particular types of ARs:
C – decaying (Collapsing) ARs;
D – individual “δ-sunspots”;
E – Equatorial ARs;
N – ARs with ambiguities in the NOAA numbers assignment and/or outlining

of boundaries of sunspot groups in various databases;

P – an AR exhibits the anti-Hale property only Part time when passing across

the disk;

R – ARs with Rotation of the sunspot-group axis;
S – small Short-lived ARs;
T – ARs with the Tilt close to 90◦;
V – ARs which are not checked for the stability of magnetic connections (lack

of EUV data);

W – “δ-sunspots” With surrounding sunspots/pores;
X – eXtracted ARs.
The extracted ARs were counted with the hosting AR NOAA numbers. Area
values in such cases were determined as follows. For the DPD data block, the

to the corrected total sunspot area of the entire hosting group. This coeﬃcient
was applied to the area value of the hosting AR from the USAF/NOAA SRS
database (at the same date) to calculate the anti-Hale region area. The auxiliary
coeﬃcient marked as “AC” is shown in the last column of the catalog.

Areas of ARs with shortcomings in areal data (see Section 2.3) were calculated
by special procedure. For example, only the areas of relevant sunspots were
counted for AR NOAA 12310 for the DPD data block.

4. Estimations of the Relative Number of Anti-Hale Regions

In total, we studied 8606 ARs of Solar Cycles 22, 23, and 24. 275 sunspot groups
were identiﬁed as anti-Hale regions and included in the catalog. We found the
anti-Hale percentage as ≈3.2, and ≈3.0 in the case of excluding short-lived ARs
with unsteady tilt. This estimation is close to previous earliest results by Hale
and Nicholson (1925), ≈2.4, and by Richardson (1948), ≈3.1.

However, as we show in the Introduction, the recent studies of anti-Hale re-
gions provide a higher percentage of 4 – 8. Possible reasons for this are discussed
below.

We found that small short-lived groups (96 ARs) comprise about a one third
of our set of anti-Hale regions. Exclusion of these ARs changes the anti-Hale per-
centage signiﬁcantly (down to ≈2.0). Since Richardson (1948), it is well known
that Hale’s polarity-law violators happen more often for small (<50 µHem)
sunspot groups. The frequency of this violation increases rather steeply with
transition to regions of smaller size (Hagenaar, 2001; Tlatov, Vasil’eva, and
Pevtsov, 2010; Stenﬂo and Kosovichev, 2012). Therefore, including smaller and
smaller groups into a sample causes increases the anti-Hale region percentage.

The sensitivity of modern instruments (Scherrer et al., 1995, 2012) allows
researchers to involve in the statistical studies weaker and weaker ARs. To
estimate the magnetic-ﬂux threshold for ARs selection in our study, we evaluated
ﬂuxes of several small short-lived ARs from the catalog. We found that the total
unsigned magnetic-ﬂux value of short-lived ARs having at least pores of both
polarities (according to our criteria) is ≈1021 Mx. This allows us to consider this
ﬂux value as an indirect estimate of the threshold for our selection. We presume
that counting of ARs with smaller magnetic ﬂuxes is one of the main reasons for
the enhanced percentage of anti-Hale groups in recent studies.

Another reason for the discrepancy might be the numerous ambiguities in anti-
Hale region identiﬁcation mentioned in Section 2.2. For example, the detection
of anti-Hale ARs in activity complexes is very challenging (Section 2.2, item 2).
According to data by Yazev (2011, 2015), there are 321 activity complexes in
Solar Cycles 22 – 24, which corresponds 900 – 1100 ARs (9 – 12 % from all ARs).
Using average evaluation of anti-Hale ARs percentage ≈4.5 (see the Introduc-
tion), we roughly estimate a possible number of anti-Hale regions in activity
complexes for three mentioned cycles as 40 – 50 ARs (up to 0.5 % from all ARs).
This is an upper limit of anti-Hale ARs number which might be missed in our
catalog.

Solar Physics A catalog of anti-Hale ARs

We also compared the anti-Hale regions list for 1989 – 2004 that was used
by Sokoloﬀ, Khlystova, and Abramenko (2015) (the 2015 database) with the co-
temporal fragment of the compiled catalog. We found that some changes occured
in the list of anti-Hale regions; the number of ARs in both databases remains
close. The changes turned out to be evenly distributed along the cycle, so that
the main inference made by Sokoloﬀ, Khlystova, and Abramenko (2015) about
the cycle variations of the relative number of anti-Hale groups did not change.

5. Conclusions

To identify ARs violating the Hale’s polarity law, we visually examined sunspot
groups from 1 January 1989 to 31 December 2018. This period encompasses the
end of the Solar Cycle 22 and the two subsequent cycles including two solar
minima, which is important for understanding the coupling between local and
global magnetic ﬁelds in terms of solar dynamo theory. We used the SOHO/MDI
and the SDO/HMI data, as well as the DPD sketches and the MWO catalog
and drawings. Detailed comparison of data from diﬀerent source allowed us to
detect a number of ambiguous cases in anti-Hale sunspot groups identiﬁcation.
We analysed the revealed errors and inaccuracies to elaborate the criteria for
identiﬁcation of sunspot groups as anti-Hale ARs. We can conclude the following.

i) The main reasons for possible errors in anti-Hale region identiﬁcation are:

a) incorrect determination of AR boundaries;
b) wrongly distributing of ARs between consecutive cycles during solar min-

ima;

c) presence of small sunspots/pores with an opposite (to a proper leading
polarity by the Hale’s law) polarity to the West from the old leading spots
in decaying ARs;

d) emergence of a new magnetic ﬂux within decaying ARs;
e) the wrong polarity of the most western spots in multipolar ARs;
f) location of an AR on the Equator;
g) appearance of the wrong polarity of sunspots located near the limb the

projection eﬀect).

ii) Two basic and four additional criteria for identifying bipolar sunspot groups
as anti-Hale regions are formulated. Our basic criteria are based on the clas-
sical ideas of Hale and Nicholson (1925) and Babcock (1961). Namely, we
assume that for an AR to be classiﬁed as an anti-Hale region, its dominating
features have to form a bipole of reverse polarity with sunspots/pores of both
polarities being present. Magnetic connection between the opposite polarities
has to be observed.

iii) The catalog of anti-Hale regions for the period of our study is compiled. For
each anti-Hale region, the catalog contains: NOAA (or DPD) number; date,
coordinates, and corrected total sunspot area at the evolutionary maximum
as determined from the DPD and the USAF/NOAA SRS data. The catalog
also contains the tilt and Mount Wilson magnetic class. In total, the catalog
contains 275 ARs, including 96 small short-lived sunspot groups.

A.V. Zhukova et al.

iv) The percentage of sunspot groups violating the Hale’s polarity law (meeting
the formulated criteria) is ≈3.0 from all studied ARs. This is close to the
earliest estimations by the authors who had examined each AR individually:
≈2.4 by Hale and Nicholson (1925) and ≈3.1 by Richardson (1948). Later
researchers reported a slightly higher percentage. The enchancement of the
percentage might be related to increasing sensitivity of instruments and,
therefore, taking into account smaller and smaller bipoles. Another reason for
the discrepancy in anti-Hale percentage is the ambiguities in the anti-Hale
regions identiﬁcation mentioned in Section 2.2.

The catalog of anti-Hale regions can be used in studying the phenomena
related to the cyclic solar activity. The catalog is available as the Electronic
Supplementary Material. The catalog is also available at the CrAO website
sun.crao.ru/databases/catalog-anti-hale.
