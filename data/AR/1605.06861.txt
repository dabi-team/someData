We analyze the optical, chemical, and electrical properties of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown 

hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) using the precursor ammonia-borane (H3N–BH3) as a function of Ar/H2 

background pressure (PTOT). Films grown at PTOT ≤ 2.0 Torr are uniform in thickness, highly crystalline, 

and consist solely of h-BN. At larger PTOT, with constant precursor flow, the growth rate increases, but 
the resulting h-BN is more amorphous, disordered, and sp3 bonded. We attribute these changes in h-BN 

grown  at  high  pressure  to  incomplete  thermolysis  of  the  H3N–BH3  precursor  from  a  passivated  Cu 

catalyst. A similar increase in h-BN growth rate and amorphization is observed even at low PTOT if the 

H3N–BH3  partial  pressure  is  initially  greater  than  the  background  pressure  PTOT  at  the  beginning  of 

growth. h-BN growth using the H3N–BH3 precursor reproducibly can give large-area, crystalline h-BN 

thin films, provided that the total pressure is under 2.0 Torr and the precursor flux is well-controlled.

INTRODUCTION 

Hexagonal  boron  nitride  (h-BN)  is  an  insulating,  two-dimensional  (2D)  equivalent  of  graphene. 

Films of h-BN have been used as insulating spacers,1 encapsulants,2 substrates for electronic devices,3, 4 

corrosion and oxidation-resistant coatings,5, 6 and surfaces for growth of other 2D nanomaterials such as 

graphene7  and  WS2.8  Most  of  these  studies  employed  small-area  (~100  µm2)  h-BN  pieces  exfoliated 

from sintered h-BN crystals,9 limiting technological use of h-BN films. Additionally, unlike graphene, 

h-BN is difficult to prepare in monolayer form by exfoliation. The electronegativity difference between 

B and N and the reduced resonance stabilization relative to graphene results in electrostatic attractions 

between layers and in-plane. Consequently, it is more challenging to control h-BN grain size and layer 

number. Furthermore, partially ionic  B–N bonds  can form between neighboring  BN layers, serving to 

“spot weld” such layers together.10 

Several  groups  have  sought  to  overcome  these  limitations  by  using  chemical  vapor  deposition 

(CVD)  to  grow  large-area,  monolayer  h-BN  films.11-22  CVD  growth  of  h-BN  has  been  accomplished 

using various precursors (e.g., ammonia borane, borazine, and diborane) on transition metal substrates 

(e.g., Cu, Ni,23 Fe,24 Ru,25, 26 etc.). Of these h-BN growth substrates, we focus on Cu, as Cu has a high 

catalytic activity,27 is inexpensive, and is the typical growth substrate28 for conventional graphene CVD. 

Regarding h-BN growth precursors, volatile borazine—B3N3H6, isoelectronic with benzene—is far from 

an  ideal  choice,  as  borazine  is  hazardous  and  decomposes  quickly  even  at  room  temperature.  While 

borazine  can  pyrolyze  and  dehydrogenate23,  25,  29,  30  to  generate  h-BN  films,13,  17,  19,  20,  22,  31  partial 

dehydrogenation  is  common,[30]  resulting  in  oligomeric  BN  compounds  and  aperiodic  h-BN  grain 

boundaries.13,  17  Finally,  thin  films  of  h-BN  can  also  be  grown  from  mixtures  of  diborane  (B2H6)  and 

ammonia (NH3),21 with the drawback that diborane is toxic and pyrophoric.  

In contrast to borazine and diborane, the molecule ammonia-borane (H3N–BH3) is inexpensive, air 

stable, and has sufficient volatility to  serve as  a  CVD precursor for h-BN thin films.12,  15,  16,  18,  21,  32-38 

High purity ammonia-borane shows no decomposition over two months at room temperature,39 and its 

vapor pressure has been estimated to be ~10-4 Torr at room temperature.40,  41 Heating ammonia-borane 

generates  hydrogen  and  volatile  B-  and  N-containing  species  that  enable  h-BN  growth;  the  generated 

 
 
 
 
3 

species  include  monomeric  aminoborane  (H2N=BH2),  borazine,  and  small  amounts  of  diborane.34,  42 

However, the growth of h-BN from ammonia-borane, typically carried out in the presence of H2, gives 

variable  results  depending  on  the  growth  temperature,43  substrate  roughness,44,  45  substrate  structure,46 

position of the growth substrate relative to the precursor source,35, 36, 43 and precursor flux.12, 16 To date, 

it is unknown how growth pressure affects CVD h-BN growth on Cu using ammonia-borane. One can 

grow h-BN with large (~35 µm2) grain sizes under atmospheric pressure CVD conditions, provided that 

the precursor flux is kept very low, an electropolished Cu surface is used, and the substrate temperature 

is kept higher than 1000 °C.45 Nevertheless, little mechanistic information is available about the CVD 

growth  of  h-BN  from  ammonia-borane—especially  at  different  growth  pressures—although  a  report 

suggests that ammonia-borane derived growths on Cu proceed by surface catalysis.16 

Here, we examine conditions under which crystalline films of h-BN can be grown from ammonia-

borane and H2 by CVD. We find that low pressure CVD (LPCVD) gives uniform, planar h-BN films, as 

ascertained  by  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM),  atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM),  X-ray 

photoelectron  spectroscopy 

(XPS),  Fourier 

transform 

infrared 

(FTIR)  spectroscopy,  Raman 

spectroscopy,  and  scanning  tunneling  microscopy  (STM)  and  spectroscopy  (STS).  While  holding  the 

precursor temperature and carrier gas flows constant, increasing the growth pressure significantly alters 

the properties of the h-BN, producing a thicker, more disordered film with non-planar, sp3 components. 

Further,  higher  precursor  flux  conditions  in  LPCVD  growth  give  thicker,  nanocrystalline  h-BN  films, 

showing  the  importance  of  the  ratio  of  precursor  to  H2  in  h-BN  CVD  growth.  As  demonstrated  for 

graphene growth,47-50 CVD growth of h-BN is sensitive to the Ar/H2 background pressure. 

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 

Chemical  Vapor  Deposition  (CVD)  of  Hexagonal  Boron  Nitride  (h-BN)  on  Cu  Foil.  Growth 

experiments  are  conducted  in  a  retrofitted  Atomate  CVD  furnace  (see  Supporting  Information  Figure 

S1). Care must be taken to eliminate adventitious carbon sources from the growth chamber, otherwise h-

BNC69  or  defective  G/h-BN  heterostructures  will  result;  the  presence  of  these  impurity  phases  can  be 

detected by Raman spectroscopy. The substrates are 0.001 inch thick (0.0254 mm) 99.8% purity Cu foils 

(Alfa Aesar), which are rinsed before use with a 10:1 H2O:HCl solution as previously described51-53 and 

annealed for 2 hr under Ar/H2 (500 sccm Ar / 100 sccm H2) at 1000 °C. Basic Copper (BC) of similar 

purity54  was  used  a  Cu  substrate  for  some  growths;  we  discriminate  these  substrates  accordingly.  The 

annealing  step  increases  the  Cu  grain  size  and  lowers  the  number  of  BN  nucleation  sites.44,  45  The 

 
 
4 

precursor H3N–BH3 (Aldrich) is transferred under N2 into a stainless steel ampoule, minimizing water 

exposure  of  the  hygroscopic  H3N–BH3.  To  transport  the  precursor  into  the  furnace,  the  ampoule  is 

heated to  ~95 °C, and volatilized material  is  swept  into the furnace by a 4:1  Ar/H2 carrier. The  h-BN 

films are grown at 1000 °C in an Ar/H2 background at the different pressures indicated. After 25 min of 

film  growth,  the  samples  are  cooled  at  ~20  °C  min-1  under  Ar  at  a  flow  rate  of  500  sccm.  See  the 

Supporting Information for further discussion of the conditions that result in a high mass (HM) flux for 

the precursor temperatures used. For further characterization, the h-BN films are transferred from the Cu 

substrate to 90 nm SiO2/Si wafers using methodologies detailed elsewhere.53, 55 

Sample  Annealing  after  Transfer.  Post-transfer  annealing  of  the  samples  to  remove  polymer 

residues  from  the  poly(methyl  methacrylate)  or  polycarbonate  transfer  handles  also  used  the  same 

furnace  as  h-BN  growth,  using  a  quartz  tube  dedicated  to  sample  annealing.  Attempts  to  anneal 

transferred h-BN films under conditions similar to those used for annealing graphene—namely, 1 hour 

in Ar/H2 at 400 °C—leads to pitting and etching of the films, as has been reported.22 Therefore, post-

transfer sample anneals were carried out in air at 550 °C as described by others;56 h-BN is known to be 

oxidation resistant under these conditions.6, 57 

Lithographic Patterning. To obtain lithographically patterned h-BN samples, we defined a square 

array in the h-BN film by UV photolithography, using a conventional TEM grid as a  mask and an O2 

plasma to etch. Polymethylglutarimide (PMGI; MicroChem) was spun at 3500 RPM for 30 s and cured 

at 165 °C for 5 min. Shipley 1813 photoresist (MicroChem) was spun on top of the cured PMGI at 5000 

RPM for 30 s. The photoresist was soft baked at 110 °C for 70 s, flood exposed to UV (i-line, 365 nm) 

through  a TEM  grid for  4 s on a Karl-Suss  aligner, and developed for 50 s in  MF-319  (MicroChem). 

Using the patterned photoresist as a mask, we etched the samples in an O2 plasma for 1 min under 20 

sccm of O2 at 100 mTorr throttle pressure and ~90 W power. After the O2 etch, the samples were soaked 

in hot (~50 °C) Remover PG (nominally n-methylpyrrolidone) for 20 min. 

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The h-BN films were examined immediately after growth 

on  the  Cu  foil  by  an  FEI  environmental  SEM  operating  at  5  kV.  All  images  were  taken  using  an 

ultrahigh-definition mode, which increases the dwell time and the beam current. We maintained similar 

values  for  the  brightness  and  contrast  during  image  collection,  so  that  the  images  in  Figure  1  can  be 

compared. 

 
 
 
5 

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Most AFM images were collected in tapping mode with ~300 

kHz Si cantilevers on a Bruker AFM with a Dimension IV controller. Scan rates were slower than 2 Hz, 

and  sampling  was  at  least  512  samples  per  line  by  512  lines;  most  of  the  scans  were  1024  x  1024 

images.  Images  with  low  noise  and  stable  phase  were  selected  for  analysis.  Images  were  de-streaked, 

plane fit, and analyzed using Gwyddion.58 Root mean square (RMS) roughness values were determined 

using Gwyddion and by means of an algorithm written in MATLAB. Autocorrelation values were also 

determined and fit in Gwyddion. Some AFM images were taken on an Asylum Research MFP-3D AFM 

in tapping mode using ~300 kHz resonant frequency Si cantilevers (NSG30 AFM tips from NT-MDT).   

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). A Kratos ULTRA XPS with a monochromatic Kα Al 

X-ray  line  was  used  to  collect  data.  We  fitted  all  sub-peaks  with  Shirley  backgrounds  and  Gaussian-

Lorentzian (GL) mixing. The amount of GL character was optimized (i.e., not fixed) in our fits, so as to 

lower the chi-squared value and be representative of the true chemical state of the sub-peak in question. 

To prevent  sample charging, samples were mounted on a conducting stage using conductive tape or a 

metal  clamp  and  were  exposed  to  a  flood  gun  during  data  collection.  All  core  levels  were  charge 

corrected to the adventitious sp2/sp3 C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.  

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. FTIR spectra of the h-BN films while still on 

the Cu foil growth substrate were collected on a Thermo Nicolet NEXUS 670 FTIR with a Smart iTR 

Attenuated  Total  Reflectance  (ATR)  Sampling  Accessory  with  a  ZnSe  window.  All  spectra  were 

acquired  in  air.  Before  measuring  an  h-BN  spectrum,  an  air  background  with  no  sample  on  the  ZnSe 

window  was  collected  and  used.  Each  spectrum  was  the  sum  of  256  scans  at  least  2  wavenumber 

resolution.  

Raman  Spectroscopy.  Raman  spectra  were  acquired  on  a  Horiba  LabRAM  HR  3D-capable 

imaging  system  at  532  nm.  Data  were  collected  with  an  1800  lines/mm  grating,  a  100×  (0.8  NA) 

objective, and a power level below ~10 mW. The Raman cross-section59 of h-BN is low at 532 nm and, 

to improve signal-to-noise ratio and avoid the fluorescent background of the Cu foil, the Raman spectra 

measurements  were  performed  on  h-BN  films  that  had  been  transferred  to  SiO2/Si  substrates.  Raman 

mapping data were acquired around the E2g band position (~1370 cm-1)60,  61 using a minimum array of 

100 Raman point spectra at ~5 µm point spacing. Each spectrum consisted of an average of four to six 

individual  measurements  made  at  the  same  location,  each  with  a  45  to  60  s  acquisition  time.  The  E2g 

 
 
 
 
6 

mode  and  the  higher  order  (~1450  cm-1)  Si  3TO  mode  intrinsic  to  the  SiO2/Si  substrate  were  each  fit 

with a single Lorentzian function using a Levenburg-Marquardt fitting algorithm in Fityk.62 

Scanning  Tunneling  Microscopy  (STM).  Our  experiments  employed  a  homebuilt,  room-

temperature  ultrahigh  vacuum  scanning  tunneling  microscope  (UHV-STM)63  with  a  base  pressure  of 

~3×10-11  Torr  and  electrochemically  etched  W  and  PtIr  tips.  Some  of  the  tips  were  sharpened  using 

field-directed  sputter  sharpening.64  We  scanned  the  samples  in  constant-current  mode,  in  which  the 

feedback electronics controlled the tip height in order to maintain a current set point, while rastering the 

tip  across  the  surface.  The  STM  tip  was  grounded  through  a  current  amplifier,  and  the  tunneling  bias 

was  applied  to  the  sample.  For  the  constant-spacing  scanning  tunneling  spectroscopy  (STS) 

measurements, the tip was stopped at predetermined locations, the tip feedback was turned off, and the 

tip-sample bias was swept through the specified range while recording the tunneling current. 

Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-vis) Absorption Spectroscopy. A Shimadzu UV-1650 PC instrument was 

used  to  collect  UV-vis  transmission  spectra  at  an  incidence  angle  of  approximately  ~60°.  h-BN  films 

were  transferred  onto  UV-transparent  quartz  slides  (SPI,  part  number  01020-AB).  The  transmission 

spectra were acquired with respect to a blank quartz slide reference. 

RESULTS 

  We have grown thin films of h-BN by CVD on polycrystalline Cu foils at 1000 °C. Our growths 

last for 25 min in the presence of H2 using the precursor ammonia-borane. Although temperatures above 

~1170 °C are required to produce crystalline h-BN from ammonia-borane in the solid state,34,  42 metal 

catalysts can reduce this threshold to the ~1000 °C temperatures used in our experiments.26, 65 

The  precursor  reservoir  is  kept  at  ~95  °C  during  deposition  runs.  At  this  temperature  ammonia-

borane decomposes slowly to generate primarily H2 and monomeric aminoborane, with negligible (i.e., 

undetected by mass spectrometry) amounts of borazine and diborane.34,  42 Typically, upon opening the 

valve to the precursor to begin growth, the pressure in the chamber increases slightly by ~0.05 Torr; this 

pressure spike dissipates over about ~1 min. For some of the deposition runs, especially if the reservoir 

temperature  is  ~100  °C,  the  pressure  increase  upon  opening  the  valve  to  the  reservoir  is  somewhat 

higher  (up  to  several  Torr),  undoubtedly  due  to  build-up  of  H2  and  ammonia-borane  decomposition 

products in the reservoir. We refer to these higher ammonia-borane partial pressure spikes as high mass 

(HM) flow conditions (see Supporting Information for further discussion).  

 
 
 
7 

A  4:1  mixture  of  Ar:H2,  with  flow  rates  of  either  400:100  standard  cubic  centimeters  per  minute 

(sccm) or 200:50 sccm, is used as a carrier gas to transport the precursor to the growth chamber. Three 

pressure  regimes  were  investigated:  (1)  low  pressure  CVD  conditions  (LPCVD),  for  which  the  total 

Ar/H2  background  pressure,  PTOT,  is  2  Torr  (PH2  =  0.4  Torr)  or  less;  (2)  medium  pressure  conditions, 

with either PTOT = 20 Torr (PH2 = 4 Torr) or PTOT = 200 Torr (PH2 = 40 Torr); and (3) atmospheric CVD 

conditions (APCVD), for which PTOT = 760 Torr (PH2 = 152 Torr). We estimate the PH2/PH3N–BH3 ratio 

over the growth surface is ~50 for our LPCVD conditions. The PH2/PH3N–BH3 ratio increases for higher 

PTOT values and decreases for HM flow conditions. 

Figure 1a shows a large-area SEM image of an h-BN film grown on Cu under LPCVD conditions. 

The closely-spaced (ca. 0.025 μm) striations running at approximately a −20° angle from vertical in the 

image indicate the step flow direction of the underlying Cu surface. These steps, which result from the 

mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between h-BN and Cu, form only if the overlayer is planar 

and has a well-ordered crystalline structure.66 The faint striations running diagonally from upper right to 

lower left are attributed to thermally induced wrinkles in the h-BN overlayer.13, 16, 32, 36, 67 Figure 1b is a 

smaller-area  SEM  image  of  another  region  of  the  same  LPCVD  grown  h-BN  sample.  The  prominent 

feature that approximately bisects the image vertically is a Cu grain boundary. Here,  an h-BN wrinkle 

crosses the Cu grain boundary; similar behavior has been seen for graphene.28 

  When growth is conducted at medium pressures of background gas, the Cu step flow features and 

h-BN  wrinkles  are  absent  and  the  surface  appears  morphologically  rough  (Figure  1c).  There  is  also  a 

high density of nanoparticles in the image. Similar results are obtained at a growth pressure of 200 Torr 

(Figure 1d); the surface is rough, and Cu step flow features are absent. Under APCVD conditions, the h-

BN  film  is  non-planar and exhibits  disordered surface features in  both  the larger-area (Figure 1e) and 

smaller-area (Figure 1f) SEM images. There are no previous reports of such disordered surface features 

for APCVD grown h-BN. There are no obvious Cu step flow features or h-BN wrinkles, suggesting that 

this film is thicker than those grown under LPCVD conditions. For additional SEM images of partially 

grown, sub-monolayer h-BN, LPCVD, and APCVD grown h-BN, see Supporting Information Figure S3 

and S4. 

Figure  2  shows  AFM  images  of  the  h-BN  films  as  a  function  of  the  Ar/H2  background  pressure 

(PTOT), along with height profiles across a film boundary generated by lithographic etching. Figure 2a 

shows  an  h-BN  film  grown  at  PTOT  =  1.2  Torr  (LPCVD  regime);  the  film  edge  is  indicated  by  the 

 
 
 
8 

dashed, blue line. The film thickness of 0.8 ± 0.1 nm corresponds well to 1 to 2 h-BN layers,9, 10 and the 

root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is 0.58 nm. The larger RMS roughness relative to the film thickness 

likely stems from entrapped water and polymeric contaminants introduced in the h-BN film transfer.53 

When a film grown under similar LPCVD conditions (PTOT = 2.0 Torr) is annealed in Ar/H2 at 400 °C, 

the film becomes smoother (0.45 nm RMS roughness) and etch tracks are formed (Figure 2b). The step 

height of the film after annealing is 1.0 ± 0.3 nm. 

Figure  2c  and  2d  shows  AFM  topographs  of  two  different  films  also  grown  under  LPCVD 

conditions (2.0 Torr), except that there was a higher than normal flux from the reservoir during growth 

(HM conditions). The higher flux was a consequence of keeping the reservoir at ~100 °C vs. 95 °C; at 

the higher temperature, the precursor evolves up to 100 times more H2 and volatile B- and N-containing 

species (see Supporting  Information  for further discussion). The resulting  h-BN films are both  thicker 

(3.2 ± 1.4 nm) and rougher (1.51 nm RMS roughness) than those grown under LPCVD conditions when 

the precursor reservoir is not  overheated. When  grown at  intermediate background pressures of  Ar/H2 

gas (PTOT = 20 Torr) but at normal flux from the reservoir, the films are also thick (3.4 ± 0.6 nm) and 

rough (3.20 nm RMS roughness). These values resemble those for the sample grown at 2.0 Torr under 

HM conditions, underscoring the importance of controlling the precursor flux during growth.  

For  intermediate  growth  pressures  (PTOT  =  20  Torr),  the  h-BN  thin  films  template  Cu  substrate 

morphology,  as  apparent  from  the  former  Cu  annealing  twin  shown  in  the  topograph  of  Figure  2e. 

Vicinal  Cu  surfaces  are  known  to  lead  to  more  defective,  thicker  graphene  growth,54  potentially 

explaining the enhanced h-BN growth on the twin. At higher growth pressures (PTOT = 200 Torr), the 

film  in  Figure  2f  and  2g  has  a  step  height  of  10.1  ±  0.9  nm  (1.53  nm  RMS  roughness),  with  large 

protrusions from transfer induced PMMA residuals.53 Under APCVD conditions (Figure 2h), the h-BN 

films are rougher still (1.64 nm RMS roughness) and possess inhomogeneous depressions with contours 

corresponding to the morphology seen in the SEM images (Figure 1e and 1f).  

The  step  height  contours  for  different  growth  pressures  shown  in  Figure  2i  indicate  that  the  film 

thickness—and  thus  the  growth  rate—increases  monotonically  with  increasing  Ar/H2  background 

pressure, except at the very highest (APCVD) pressures. The unexpected decrease in film thickness for 

h-BN grown under APCVD conditions seen in Figure 2h could result from a slowed chemical reaction 

between the O2 etching plasma and the APCVD grown h-BN thin film. Lowered O2 plasma activity is 

consistent with a different structural (i.e., disordered) and chemical (i.e., higher N content) character for 

 
 
 
9 

the APCVD versus LPCVD films, as detailed below. Regardless, analysis of Cu substrate photoelectron 

attenuation  (see  Supporting  Information)  from  the  h-BN  overlayer  allows  us  to  estimate  the  APCVD 

film thickness at 17.8 ± 1.1 nm. 

Figure  3a  and  3b  shows  XPS  photoelectron  data  in  the  B  1s  and  N  1s  core  level  regions, 

respectively, for h-BN samples grown at PTOT = 2.0, 20, 200, and 760 Torr. The Supporting Information 

gives XPS data for a film grown at 1.2 Torr LPCVD and an additional film grown at 760 Torr (Figure 

S6). Table 1 summarizes the peak binding energies and FWHM values. The principal B 1s feature has a 

binding energy (BE) of ~190.5 eV, characteristic of bulk BN (both hexagonal and cubic phases).68 The 

plots contain XPS data for h-BN films grown at  2.0 Torr on  Cu foil from  two different  vendors,  Alfa 

Aesar and Basic Copper (BC).54 The data for both films possess similar line shapes and peak position 

BEs. For all the films, a broad π plasmon loss occurs at ~199.5 eV,68, 69 demonstrating that the films are 

hexagonal and not cubic in phase.  

For films grown at Ar/H2 background pressures above 2.0 Torr, there is an additional B 1s feature 

at  ~191.1  to  191.6  eV,  as  determined  by  the  deconvolution  of  the  core  level  spectra.  This  feature  is 

characteristic  of  sp3  B  centers,  such  as  those  found  in  sp3  rich  amorphous  BN  films69  and  in 

polyaminoborane (BE = 191.1 eV).70 The FWHM of this sp3 B component increases as the background 

pressure  increases,  with  the  largest  values  measured  under  APCVD  conditions  (Table  1,  Supporting 

Information Table S5-S7). The main N 1s XPS feature has a BE of ~398 eV, which is also characteristic 

of  h-BN.68  The  N  1s  features  shown  in  Figure  3b  do  not  significantly  broaden  or  shift  in  BE  as  the 

growth pressure increases. However, some APCVD h-BN thin films have a higher BE sub-peak in the N 

1s  core  level  (see  Supporting  Information  Figure  S6),  corresponding  to  sp3  N  (see  Supporting 

Information Figure S6).69 While the films consist mostly of sp2 h-BN, at higher growth pressures they 

possess a small sp3 component.  

As  the  Ar/H2  background  pressure  increases,  the  B:N  stoichiometry  of  the  films—as  determined 

from the total areas of the B 1s and N 1s core levels—decreases from 1:1.0 (PTOT = 2.0 Torr) to 1:0.81 

(PTOT = 200 Torr). At PTOT = 760 Torr, the B:N stoichiometry returns to a 1:1 ratio. The spectra suggest 

that the films consist of 1:1 h-BN that is increasingly mixed with a B-rich sp3 component at background 

pressures up to 200 Torr. If we examine only the area under the sp2 components for the B 1s and N 1s 

core levels, the h-BN films grown at PTOT ≤ 200 Torr are stoichiometric (namely, a 1:1 ratio of the areas 

of the B and N sp2 components). Conversely, the APCVD h-BN film in Figure 3a and 3b has a sp2 B:N 

 
 
 
10 

stoichiometry of 1:1.22, implying that the APCVD grown h-BN is in a different chemical state. Thus, 

higher Ar/H2 background pressures lead to the generation of disordered surface features (Figure 1e, 1f, 

and 2h) and change the chemical state in the h-BN thin films.  

Depth profiles generated from time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) data as 

a function of sputtering time suggest that B—but not N—diffuses into the Cu substrate during growth of 

an h-BN film at a Ar/H2 background pressure of 2.0 Torr (Figure 3c). We track the nitrogen in the Cu 

subsurface by the Cu+N mass spectra in Figure 3c, since elemental nitrogen is challenging to observe in 

Cs+  based  TOF-SIMS  profiling.  The  Cu+N  mass  spectra  are  significantly  weaker  than  the  B  mass 

spectra, and they track the subsurface H2. These observations suggest that the N does not diffuse into the 

Cu substrate. The results are not surprising, especially at a growth temperature of 1000 °C. Whereas B is 

soluble  in  copper,  N  is  not,71,  72  although  there  may  be  some  diffusion  of  N  atoms  into  Cu  grain 

boundaries, as seen for Ni and Co foils.73 Sub-surface B during h-BN synthesis is expected, as reported 

for  borazine-derived  growth74  of  h-BN  films.  Thus,  low  pressure,  ammonia-borane  derived  h-BN 

syntheses proceed by both bulk precipitation and surface catalysis. Further, these findings are consistent 

the recent observation of bulk precipitation for CVD h-BN growth on Ni and Co foils.73, 75 

Figure 4a shows FTIR spectra for h-BN films grown under a variety of conditions; a spectrum of 

the bare Cu foil is also presented. The h-BN samples all have a peak near ~824 cm-1 for the A2u out-of-

plane h-BN vibration.20,  60,  76 The ATR accessory used does not permit observation of the  E1u in-plane 

vibrational mode of h-BN near ~1367 cm-1.60, 76 The intensity of the A2u peak is similar for the LPCVD 

h-BN  samples  grown  1.2  Torr  and  2.0  Torr,  but  the  A2u  peak  intensity  increases—indicating  thicker 

films—if  the  growth  time  is  doubled  to  50  minutes  or  the  growth  is  conducted  under  HM  flow 

conditions. A thicker h-BN film would lead to increased signal intensity. 

The intensity of the ~823 cm-1 peak for the h-BN film  grown at  760 Torr is  slightly smaller than 

that seen for the  LPCVD samples, which is  unexpected given that AFM measurements show that  this 

sample is thicker than the LPCVD samples (Figure 2). The altered morphological and chemical structure 

of  the  APCVD  grown  film  may  be  responsible  for  this  effect.  Although  weak,  there  is  a  feature  near 

~794 cm-1 that is characteristic of disordered h-BN films.34 In Figure 4b, the spectrum for the APCVD 

grown film also shows three distinct peaks at ~1144, ~1207, and ~1271 cm-1 on top of a broad baseline. 

Byproducts generated by thermolysis of the H3N–BH3 precursor possess peaks in this range.34, 77 These 

 
 
 
11 

peaks corroborate the disordered, polymeric surface morphology (Figure 1 and 2) and the sp3 B and N 

chemical components (Figure 3) seen in the APCVD h-BN thin films.  

Figure 5a shows Raman spectra for h-BN films grown at PTOT = 1.2, 2.0, 20, 200, and 760 Torr. 

The spectra show both the h-BN E2g band60, 61 (which for bulk samples appears at ~1366 cm-1) and the Si 

3TO mode78 at ~1450 cm-1. The intensity of the Si 3TO mode from the substrate decreases as the growth 

pressure increases; this correlates with the increased h-BN film thickness (Figure 2i). As the h-BN films 

becomes thicker, the E2g mode frequency decreases from 1370.2 cm-1 for PTOT = 1.2 Torr to 1368.6 cm-1 

for PTOT = 200 Torr. Moreover, the E2g frequency is essentially unchanged for thicker growths (1369.1 

cm-1  at  PTOT  =  760  Torr);  see  the  histogram  plots  in  Supporting  Information  Figure  S9.  The  E2g 

frequencies of the thickest films are higher (i.e., less bulk-like) than expected,61 likely reflecting either a 

change in the chemical structure or regions of inhomogeneous strain in the high pressure grown films.33, 

79 

The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the E2g band is less sensitive to strain and is a good 

measure of h-BN crystallite ordering.80 The spectra reveal that the FWHM of the E2g mode—as fitted to 

a single Lorentzian—increases with growth pressure (Figure 5b). The FWHM values of 19.7 cm-1 (PTOT 

= 1.2 Torr) and 19.2 cm-1 (PTOT = 2.0 Torr) are similar to those reported for monolayer and bilayer h-BN 

films exfoliated from sintered crystals.61 Conversely, the FWHM values of 28.3 cm-1 (PTOT = 20 Torr), 

24.5  cm-1  (PTOT  =  200  Torr),  and  25.1  cm-1  (PTOT  =  760  Torr)  indicate  that  the  h-BN  films  lose  long 

range order and become defective80 when grown at high Ar/H2 background pressures. 

Since  the  h-BN  thin  films  are  grown  on  Cu,  scanning  tunneling  microscopy  and  spectroscopy 

(STM/S) is a straightforward way to measure their electronic band gaps. Figure 6a and 6b shows STM 

topographs of thin h-BN films on Cu grown under LPCVD conditions at 2.0 Torr. The STM image in 

Figure 6a is relatively streaky, and these h-BN films required high tip-sample bias conditions for stable 

scanning.  There  is  no  evidence  of  Moiré  interference  patterns  between  the  h-BN  film  and  the  Cu 

substrate; instead, the only features evident are the Cu substrate terraces. These terrace steps in Figure 

6b  are  likely  related  to  an  h-BN  induced  reconstruction  of  the  Cu  surfaces.66  Still,  the  roughened  Cu 

morphology54 can produce h-BN grain boundaries, which in turn will have more armchair edges81 from 

the obtuse angles of Figure 6b. The need for these bias conditions, the lack of finer Cu substrate detail 

through  the  h-BN,  and  the  missing  Moiré  superstructures  indicate  that  this  film  is  thin,  but  certainly 

more than one layer thick (i.e., 2 to 3 layers). Furthermore, these findings are consistent with the AFM 

 
 
 
12 

step height data (Figure 2i, Supporting Information Figure S5) and also suggest that the film possesses a 

wide band gap.  

By contrast, the STM topograph of h-BN grown at 1.2 Torr (Figure 6c) shows a linear pattern from 

the Cu substrate. This linear pattern has a period of ~2 nm, similar to the pattern observed for graphene 

on Cu(111) after oxygen intercalation.82 Unlike the sample in Figure 6a and 6b, scanning is stable at tip-

sample biases well within the h-BN band gap. Therefore, this sample is most likely an h-BN monolayer 

on the Cu foil substrate. The plot in Figure 6d displays the tunneling current (I) versus the tip-sample 

bias (V) for individual STS spectra recorded at different locations on the h-BN film grown at PTOT = 2.0 

Torr shown in Figure 6a; the solid black line indicates the average spectrum. The average band gap of 

~5.7 eV is consistent with that of bulk h-BN.9, 21 

In order to  verify that  the band  gap measured on the nanometer scale is  also  characteristic of the 

entire film, we also characterize the films by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy. The 

plot displayed in Figure 6e shows UV-vis absorption spectra for h-BN films grown at PTOT = 1.0 and 1.2 

Torr  after  transfer  to  UV-transparent  quartz.  Analysis  of  the  UV-vis  absorption  spectra  by  the  Tauc 

method12, 15, 20, 21, 83 shows that the LPCVD h-BN films have optical band gaps between 5.3 eV and 5.5 

eV, which is within the expected range for h-BN9, 21 and close to electronic band gaps measured by STS. 

A  two  point  probe  transport  measurement  of  an  h-BN  film  grown  under  LPCVD  conditions  further 

confirms that the films are not conducting (see Supporting Information Figure S11). Our combined STS 

and UV-vis absorption spectroscopic measurements ultimately support the conclusion that the LPCVD 

h-BN films have the electronic signature of crystalline h-BN. 

DISCUSSION 

For  the  CVD  of  h-BN  from  ammonia-borane  on  Cu  at  1000  °C  in  the  presence  of  a  4:1  Ar/H2 

background gas, we have found the following: at Ar/H2 background pressures of 20 Torr (PH2 = 4 Torr) 

or above, the growth rate increases with pressure, but the films contain larger and larger amounts of a 

sp3 component that is  similar to  amorphous BN  or polyaminoborane (PAB).  The  faster  growth rate is 

consistent with previous studies of the CVD of graphene, showing that H2 serves as a co-catalyst49 and 

that  the  growth  depends  on  the  H2  to  precursor  ratio.49,  50    However,  the  results  are  in  contrast  to 

previous  findings  that  H2  etches  spurious  h-BN  nucleation22  and  removes  polymeric  PAB  and 

polyiminoborane (PIB) species,84 as we observe h-BN, PAB, and PIB compounds in h-BN films grown 

at high Ar/H2 background pressure. We can reconcile the contrasting observations by proposing that, at 

 
 
 
13 

the higher H2 pressures, the faster h-BN growth rates cause the Cu foil to become quickly covered, so 

that its catalytic activity is suppressed. As a result, the precursor does not completely decompose on top 

of  the  already  deposited  h-BN  layers.  In  the  absence  of  a  catalyst,  growth  of  h-BN  from  H3N–BH3 

requires very high temperatures (~1500 °C).34 Incomplete decomposition of the H3N–BH3 precursor34, 77 

explains  several  of  the  properties  of  the  h-BN  samples  grown  at  a  Ar/H2  background  pressure  of  760 

Torr: the amorphous, disordered surface morphology, the sp3 components observed in the XPS data, and 

the extra, polymeric peaks in the FTIR spectra.  

Previously, Bhaviripudi et al. showed that the growth of CVD graphene on Cu is demarcated into 

three growth regimes: surface reaction (catalysis), mixed growth, and mass transport.47 In these growth 

regimes,  the  total  pressure  PTOT  determined  whether  graphene  growth  proceeded  by  catalysis  or 

otherwise. For h-BN growths on Cu at PTOT > 20 Torr (medium pressure CVD to APCVD), we note an 

increase in the surface growth rate Ks and a significant decrease in the mass transfer coefficient hg. The 

decrease in mass transfer coefficient hg occurs because the coefficient is inversely proportional to PTOT: 

,  where  δ  is  the  boundary  layer  thickness,  weakly  dependent  on  PTOT.47  Under  these 

conditions,  hg  <<  Ks,  making  the  mass  transport  flux  dominant  over  surface  reactions,  ultimately 

eliminating  the  high  temperature  catalytic  decomposition  of  ammonia  borane.  LPCVD  h-BN  growth 

conditions  increase  hg,  promoting  surface  catalysis  (hg  >>  Ks),  growing  sp2  h-BN,  and  removing 

spurious PAB and PIB. Remnant borane derivatives and substrate N in-diffusion can drive local B and N 

gradients,  influencing  the  shape  of  growing  h-BN  nuclei  into  atypical  morphologies,  as  a  recent 

theoretical report predicted.85 

Finally,  it  is  important  to  control  the  temperature  of  the  precursor  reservoir,  because  the  rate  of 

decomposition of H3N–BH3 to H2, monomeric aminoborane, borazine, and other (mostly non-volatile) 

products is quite temperature sensitive.34, 42,  77,  86 An overheated ammonia-borane precursor can lead to 

polymerization  of  the  precursor,  generate  adventitious  H2,  and  increase  the  partial  pressure  of  the 

precursor relative to the Ar/H2 background pressure. In this HM flow growth scenario, the increased flux 

of H2, monomeric aminoborane, and other volatile compounds will drive a thicker, nanocrystalline h-BN 

morphology, circumventing the catalytic activity of the Cu substrate at high temperature. 

CONCLUSION 

The  growth  of  large-arean  h-BN  on  Cu  by  CVD  depends  critically  on  the  background  Ar/H2 

pressure (PTOT). Uniform, planar thin h-BN grows under LPCVD conditions (PTOT = 2 Torr), whereas 

11GTOThP 
 
 
14 

medium  pressure  (PTOT  =  200  Torr)  and  APCVD  growth  conditions  (PTOT  =  760  Torr)  afford  thicker 

films  with  a  mixture  of  h-BN  and  partially  decomposed,  sp3  like  H3N–BH3  species.  Under  medium 

pressure  and  APCVD  conditions,  the  faster  growth  rate  leads  to  rougher,  less  crystalline  films.  Under 

APCVD conditions, amorphous, polymeric features form, which we attribute to incomplete thermolysis 

of the H3N–BH3 precursor due to passivation of the Cu catalyst. Moreover, growth under HM conditions 

shows  that  the  growth  rate  depends  critically  on  the  H2  to  H3N–BH3  flux  ratio,  even  under  LPCVD 

growth conditions. Our LPCVD growths produce h-BN thin films comparable in electronic and optical 

quality to those recently observed for h-BN grown on sapphire.87 By contrast, our APCVD growths are 

similar  in  variability  to  those  reported  in  the  literature.21,44  To  grow  high-performance  h-BN 

nanomaterials  demands  a  clear  understanding  of  h-BN  CVD  growth  mechanisms.  As  a  result,  h-BN 

growth protocols will better control layer number, chemical heterogeneity, and crystallinity, enabling the 

fabrication of large area, electronic and encapsulatory h-BN heterostructures.

Section S1. High ammonia borane mass (HM) flow growth conditions 

The  temperature  of  the  ampoule  containing  the  ammonia-borane  (H3N–BH3)  powder  controls  the 

precursor flux during the growth. If the precursor temperature is not controlled well, then the precursor 

flux during growth will vary widely. During our growth experiments, we observed that there is typically 

a small increase (~10 to ~100 mTorr) in the measured pressure in the growth chamber upon opening the 

valve between the precursor ampoule and the Ar/H2 flow at the inlet of the furnace. During the first thermal 

cycle of the precursor, the increase in pressure upon opening the valve to the precursor can be significantly 

higher, from an increase in pressure by ~1 Torr to a maximum observed increase of ~10 Torr. Such a large 

flux of precursor byproducts flooding the chamber dramatically changes the balance between the H3N–

BH3 byproducts and H2. Previous studies of CVD growth of graphene on Cu substrates1,2 showed that the 

ratio of carbon precursor to H2 plays a very important role in nucleation density and grain size.  

As shown in Figure 2 of the main manuscript, the resulting film thickness and roughness both increase 

during a growth where HM precursor conditions existed upon opening the precursor valve as compared 

to  a  growth  with  normal  precursor  flux.  For  the  h-BN  sample  shown  in  Figure  2b,  the  precursor 

temperature was not well-controlled and varied between ~90 °C and 100 °C. For the h-BN sample shown 

in  Figure  2c,  the  precursor  temperature  was  between  99  °C  and  102  °C.  While  a  higher  precursor 

temperature can increase the precursor byproduct flux, this HM growth condition can also occur with the 

precursor temperature set to the 95 °C value used for the growth of the other of the samples in this study. 

Typically, this HM pressure spike occurs during the first growth after re-loading the ampoule with H3N–

BH3.  The  HM  growth  condition  can  be  minimized  during  the  first  growth  by  thermally  cycling  the 

precursor to the target temperature (95 °C in this case) while pumping under vacuum for ~ 15–25 min 

prior to use for h-BN CVD synthesis. Subsequent h-BN growths using the thermally-cycled precursor in 

the ampoule will have more typical increases in the chamber pressure (usually less than 100 mTorr) upon 

opening the precursor valve to begin the h-BN growth step.   

Raman data in Figures S10a and S10c show a comparison of Raman statistics from a normal h-BN 

growth at 1.0 Torr and one with HM precursor flux with a background growth pressure of 0.6 Torr. During 

the HM growth, the pressure spike reached 10 Torr from the 0.6 Torr Ar/H2 background, and the resulting 

h-BN had a film thickness of ~46 nm and film roughness of 9.6 nm. While the peak position is nearly the 

same between the normal h-BN growth at 1.0 Torr (Figure S10b) and the HM growth at 0.6 Torr (Figure 

S10a), the average FWHM of the h-BN film grown under HM conditions (Figure S10c) is much higher 

 
 
 
S3 

than for the normal growth at 1.0 Torr (Figure S10d). Hence, HM growth conditions lead to h-BN films 

with larger E2g mode FWHM than for films grown under normal precursor flux conditions at the same or 

similar pressures. Larger FWHM for the h-BN E2g Raman mode indicates that HM conditions lead to h-

BN films with more nanocrystalline and defective structure than their normal precursor flux counterparts.3  

The Raman spectra for the h-BN film grown at 20 Torr (Figure 5b in the main manuscript) has an 

average value of ~28 cm-1, very close to the ~29 cm-1 average FWHM of the Raman data for the HM 

growth in Figure S10c. This suggests that, despite the thermal pre-treatment of the precursor immediately 

prior to use for this growth, the precursor flux for the h-BN sample grown at 20 Torr was also higher than 

expected  for  the  precursor  temperature.  Given  the  detrimental  effects  of  HM  growth  conditions,  good 

control of the precursor temperature and preparation of the precursor are critically important for h-BN 

growth. While the HM growth from Figure S10a and S10c (film thickness of ~46 nm) shows that growth 

rate increases as the ratio between H2 and the H3N–BH3 byproducts (PH2:PH3N–BH3) goes down, the surface 

never has the dendritic, disordered features observed for h-BN grown at APCVD conditions. This points 

to a different growth mechanism for low pressure, HM growth conditions, likely Volmer-Weber island 

growth. The h-BN films grown under HM conditions underscore the importance of the ratio between H2 

and the H3N–BH3 byproducts in determining the properties of the resulting h-BN film.

mass flow (high sublimation). Therefore, care must be taken to control the sublimation rate carefully.

Table S1. RMS roughness of h-BN versus growth pressure after transfer to SiO2/Si. AFM scans of h-BN after 
transfer show that the roughness of the h-BN increases with growth pressure. While the roughness of the lowest 
pressure growth (1.2 Torr) is higher than the 2.0 Torr growth, this is most likely due to the conformal nature of the 
1 to 2 h-BN layer film on the substrate compared to the thicker film grown at 2.0 Torr. The standard error for each

Figure S7. Fitting comparisons for XPS B 1s core level data. (a) Core level data for CVD h-BN grown at 2.0 
Torr, fitted with one Gaussian-Lorentzian (GL) lineshape about the main sp2 B 1s peak. We hold that accurate fits 
are achieved when the residual value, given by χ2, is less than 0.1, as is the case for (a). (b) The same core level 
data as (a), fitted with two GL lineshapes under the main sp2 B 1s peak. A sub-peak at higher binding energy (BE) 
under the main sp2 B 1s peak can correspond to sp3-like B domains within the film,8 similar to graphene C 1s XPS 
spectra. The χ2 value for (b) is less than (a), but since both are less than 0.1, the second GL sub-peak at higher BE 
is redundant. Thus, the number of sp3 domains in the 2 Torr h-BN growth is minimal. (c) Core level data for CVD 
h-BN grown at 200 Torr. A single GL fit about the sp2 B 1s peak gives a high χ2 value, implying that some sp3 
domains might be present. (d) The same core level data as (c), fit with two GL lineshapes under the main sp2 B 
peak.  Compared  to  (c),  the  lower  χ2  value asserts that  two sub-peaks  are  necessary.  Hence,  the  200  Torr  h-BN 
growth has some sp3 structure. Nevertheless, the absence of the c-BN bulk plasmon peak8 both show that the sp3 
domains are not in a c-BN configuration. The sp3 domains likely originate from partially dehydrogenated H3N–BH3 
species and the poorer crystalline nature of the films grown at higher pressures.

Comparison of the residuals from fitting the B 1s core level data for the LPCVD (2.0 Torr) h-BN growth shows 
only a small difference between using 1 GL lineshape and using 2 GL lineshapes, indicating that 1 GL lineshape is 
sufficient. The difference between using 1 GL lineshape and 2 GL lineshapes is more obvious for the higher pressure 
growth (200 Torr). In turn, 1 GL lineshape is insufficient to fit the B 1s core level for the 200 Torr growth.

Table S2. XPS Cu 2p3/2 peak intensity versus growth pressure. With a relatively homogeneous h-BN overlayer 
on the Cu, the Cu 2p3/2 peak intensity decreases with increasing thickness. Thus, the grown films are thickest at 
APCVD, which is qualitatively supported by the AFM step height data. Using the step height data for h-BN 
grown at 200 Torr (10.1 ± 0.9 nm), the Cu 2p3/2 sub-peak intensities, and the following equation for photoelectron 

attenuation (

), we can estimate the additional overlayer thickness for the 760 Torr 

growth. We find the additional thickness to be 7.7 ± 0.7 nm, resulting in a layer thickness of 17.8 ± 1.1 nm after 
propagating uncertainty. Here, the takeoff angle θ = 54.5° and the average thickness is integrated versus the 
effective attenuation length λ.

film, as in the 200 Torr case.

Figure S10. Raman histograms for h-BN grown with differing precursor amounts. Raman E2g band position 
for LPCVD h-BN growth with high precursor flux condition (a) and LPCVD h-BN growth with normal precursor 
flux condition (b). Due to a precursor problem during the growth in (a), there was a brief spike in the pressure when 
opening the valve to the precursor ampoule from the 0.6 Torr background to 10 Torr. Such conditions greatly change 
the ratio  of  precursor to  H2  from  normal  growth  process.  Similar to the  comparison  between  LPCVD  and high 
precursor flux LPCVD h-BN shown in Figure 5, the h-BN from (a) was thicker than that from (b), despite similar 
growth pressures. Despite the different film thicknesses between the two growths, they share the same average E2g 
band position at ~1371 cm-1. Comparing the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the E2g Raman mode for the 
two cases (c,d) shows that the high precursor flux LPCVD h-BN growth has a significantly higher FWHM compared 
to the LPCVD growth with normal precursor flux. The larger FWHM value indicates that the high precursor flux 
LPCVD h-BN growth is nanocrystalline,3 despite the low Ar/H2 background growth pressure used. Thus, the larger 
ratios of precursor to Ar/H2 carrier gas create h-BN with smaller crystallite size.  The h-BN film from (a, c) was 
thick, with a step height of ~46 nm. This implies that in the high mass flow regime the surface catalysis reaction 
rate is dominated by the mass transport reaction rate. Ultimately, the film’s thickness is determined by how much 
H3N–BH3 can diffuse through a gas boundary layer. The high level of sensitivity for the h-BN growth reaction rates 
is in striking contrast to graphene.12

between two Au/Ti contacts. Current ID is comparable to the noise floor for the probe station. This shows that the 
h-BN  is  not  conducting.  (b)  Atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM)  image  of  a  representative  device  from  (a).  RMS 
roughness is 0.51 nm within the blue box, and the image shows a wrinkle introduced from transfer. Despite these 
features, the h-BN is relatively smooth. This h-BN for this device is from the same growth as that shown in Figure 
2b, after annealing in air at 500 °C for 1 hr. This h-BN growth is ~3.2 nm thick.
