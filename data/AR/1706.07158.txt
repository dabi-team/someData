ABSTRACT
Light walls, as ensembles of oscillating bright structures rooted in sunspot light bridges, have not
been well studied, although they are important for understanding sunspot properties. Using the
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and Solar Dynamics Observatory observations, here we study
the evolution of two oscillating light walls each within its own active region (AR). The emission of each
light wall decays greatly after the appearance of adjacent brightenings. For the ﬁrst light wall, rooted
within AR 12565, the average height, amplitude, and oscillation period signiﬁcantly decrease from 3.5
Mm, 1.7 Mm, and 8.5 min to 1.6 Mm, 0.4 Mm, and 3.0 min, respectively. For the second light wall,
rooted within AR 12597, the mean height, amplitude, and oscillation period of the light wall decrease
from 2.1 Mm, 0.5 Mm, and 3.0 min to 1.5 Mm, 0.2 Mm, and 2.1 min, respectively. Particularly, a part
of the second light wall becomes even invisible after the inﬂuence of nearby brightening. These results
reveal that the light walls are suppressed by nearby brightenings. Considering the complex magnetic
topology in light bridges, we conjecture that the fading of light walls may be caused by a drop in
the magnetic pressure, where ﬂux is cancelled by magnetic reconnection at the site of the nearby
brightening. Another hypothesis is that the wall fading is due to the suppression of driver source
(p-mode oscillation), resulting from the nearby avalanche of downward particles along reconnected
brightening loops.

1. INTRODUCTION
Light bridges are bright structures deeply anchored in
the convection zone, and they are often accounted for the
incompletely suppressed convection (Sobotka et al. 1993;
Borrero & Ichimoto 2011; Lagg et al. 2014). The mag-
netic ﬁeld in a light bridge is mostly much weaker than
the neighboring umbra (Rueedi et al. 1995; Jurˇc´ak et al.
2006; Sobotka et al. 2013). Analysing images obtained
in the 1600 ˚A ultraviolet (UV) channel of the Transi-
tion Region and Coronal Explorer, Berger & Berdyugina
(2003) found persistent brightness enhancements over a
light bridge. In some other studies, more dynamic bright-
enings and surges were observed in the lower atmosphere
above sunspot light bridges (Asai et al. 2001; Shimizu et
al. 2009; Tian et al. 2014; Louis et al. 2014; Toriumi et
al. 2015a, b; Robustini et al. 2016; Song et al. 2017).

Combining observations of AR 12192 made by the New
Vacuum Solar Telescope (Liu et al. 2014) and Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS ; De Pontieu et al.
2014), Yang et al. (2015) found an ensemble of oscillat-
ing bright structures rooted in a light bridge and named
it light wall. The light wall, especially the wall top, is
much brighter than the surroundings. Yang et al. (2015)
suggested that the light wall oscillations are caused by

the leakage of p-modes from the sub-photosphere. Bharti
(2015) also noted that a wave phenomenon seems to be
responsible for the coherent behavior of neighbouring os-
cillating structures above the light bridge. Afterward,
a survey of seven-month IRIS observations by Hou et
al. (2016a) reveals that most light walls are rooted in
(2017) analyzed
light bridges. Recently, Zhang et al.
IRIS spectral data of a light wall which also exhibits
pronounced oscillations in the height of the light wall.
They deduced from the blue- and red-shifted Doppler
signals that the oscillations are likely caused by shocked
p-mode waves originated from the sub-photosphere.

Last but not least, Yang et al.

(2016) found that,
when falling material reached the base of a light wall,
the height and brightness of the light wall increased, im-
plying that the light wall can be enhanced by external
disturbance. Diﬀerent from the light wall enhancement,
we report in the present Letter an unusual and puz-
zling phenomenon, i.e., light walls can be signiﬁcantly
weakened due to the suppression of nearby brightenings
observed by IRIS and the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO ; Pesnell et al. 2012).

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS
We study two light walls suppressed by nearby bright-
enings. The ﬁrst event (Event 1) was observed by IRIS
from 22:04:13 UT on 2016 July 22 to 02:08:33 UT on July
23 with a cadence of 37 s. The second one (Event 2) was
observed also by IRIS from 12:01:52 UT to 19:30:10 UT
on 2016 September 26 with a cadence of 21 s. For each
event, there are four series of images obtained with Slit-
Jaw Imager (SJI) in 2832 ˚A, 2796 ˚A, 1330 ˚A, and 1400
˚A channels. These SJI images have a pixel size of 0.′′333
and a ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of 120′′ × 119′′. The Atmo-
spheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on-
board SDO monitors the Sun in ten (E)UV lines with

a pixel size of 0′′.6 and cadence of (12)24 s. For these
two events, we mainly focus on two sequences of AIA 94
˚A images in order to study the loop brightenings nearby
the light walls. To coalign the IRIS images with the AIA
intensity maps, we use concurrently taken continuum im-
ages from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI;
Scherrer et al. 2012) on-board SDO. Each sequence of
the SDO data are processed to Level 1.5 by applying
the standard routine aia prep.pro and then diﬀerentially
rotated to a reference time. Thus the AIA and HMI
images are automatically aligned. Next, we coalign the
IRIS 2832 ˚A data with the HMI intensity maps using the
cross-correlation method (setpts.pro available as part of
the SSWIDL software tree).

94 ˚A 15 min ahead (see panel (c1)).

Figures 2(a1)-(a3) and the associated animation show
the light wall in SJI 2796 ˚A before, during, and after the
inﬂuence of the nearby brightening, respectively. The
corresponding appearances in SJI 1330 ˚A are presented
in panels (b1)-(b3). The top and base of the light wall
are identiﬁed from both the 1330 ˚A and 2796 ˚A images.
At 22:23 UT, the projected height (the distance between
the wall top and wall base) was about 2.1 Mm (see panels
(a1) and (b1)). The nearby brightening extended to the
light wall from the left side and then impacted on the
wall base (panels (a2) and (b2)). After that, the light
wall became much fainter and less pronounced, both in
emission and height (panels (a3) and (b3)). To study
the fading of the light wall, we derive two time-distance
plots (see panels (c) and (d)) from two sequences of SJI
2796 ˚A and 1330 ˚A images along slice “A–B” (marked
by blue dashed lines in panels (a2) and (b2)). From
analysing the time-distance plots in panels (c) and (d),
we conclude that the wall top moved upward and down-
ward successively, indicating an oscillatory pattern in the
height of the light wall. At the time around 22:29 UT
(marked by the vertical lines), the brightening nearby
the wall (denoted by the blue arrow) began to aﬀect the
light wall. The average height of the light wall before
this inﬂuence was about 3.5 Mm. Due to the inﬂuence
caused by the brightening, the mean height of the light
wall decreased to 1.6 Mm. The average amplitude of the
associated oscillation also decreased, from 1.7 Mm to 0.4
Mm. In addition, the oscillation period of the light wall
has also changed. In the 18.5 min interval preceding the
interaction with the brightening, the mean period of os-
cillation was about 8.5 min, and after the interaction, it
has dropped down to about 3.0 min in the following 13
min interval.

3. RESULTS
The ﬁrst light wall is rooted in a light bridge (denoted
by the red arrow in Figure 1(a)) within AR 12565, which
is located at the west of AR 12567 and close to the west
limb of the solar disk. At 22:14:00 UT, the light wall,
especially the wall top and wall base (pointed by two
arrows in panel (b1)) can be identiﬁed in the SJI 1330
˚A image. At the left side, nearby the light wall, a set
of loops with length of about 25 Mm brightened, which
were quite conspicuous at 22:29:16 UT (the footpoints of
these loops are marked by arrows in panel (b2)). Since
the appearance of the light wall and nearby brightenings
in SJI 1400 ˚A images are similar to that in 1330 ˚A im-
ages, we do not show the 1400 ˚A images here.
In the
simultaneous AIA image, the loops were very bright in
the EUV 94 ˚A line (panel (c2); also see the animation of
Figure 1). The loop brightening corresponds to a B5.6
ﬂare with the peak at 22:30 UT, according to the Geo-
stationary Operational Environmental Satellite soft x-ray
ﬂare classiﬁcation. However, the loops were invisible in

An associated animation (Movie2.mp4) of this ﬁgure is available.

The second light wall is located within the emerging
AR 12597 (see Figure 3(a)). We note that, there is an-
other light bridge (pointed by the red arrow in panel
(a)) in one sunspot of the AR. In the SJI 1330 ˚A image
(panel (b)), a light wall rooted in the light bridge can be
clearly identiﬁed, and its top and base are marked by two
green arrows. However, the light wall was almost invisi-
ble in the AIA 94 ˚A image at 15:15:12 UT (panel (c1)).
Several minutes later, a set of coronal loops with an av-
erage length of about 45 Mm brightened, i.e., that this
is an estimated length, as highlighted by the arrows in
panel (c2) (also see the animation of Figure 3). The loop

brightening corresponds to a B2.5 ﬂare with the peak at
15:20 UT. We note that the loop set itself connects to the
opposite polarity ﬁelds of the AR, and, one of its ends
appears as brighter points (marked by the lower arrow),
located nearby the base of the light wall.

Figure 4(a1) shows that the light wall (outlined by the
blue circle) is brighter than the surrounding area ob-
served in SJI 2796 ˚A. In the SJI 1330 ˚A line, the emis-
sions of the wall top and wall base are much higher than
those of the wall body and the surrounding region (see
panel (b1)). The right side nearby region of the light
wall brightened and was very appealing at 15:17:43 UT

Then, the brightening became more violent and aﬀected
the light wall at 15:18:04 UT, as shown in panels (a3)
and (b3). The left part of the light wall (overlaid by
slice “C-D”) almost disappeared, and only the right part
(overlaid by slice “A-B”) remained (also see the anima-
tion of Figure 4). One and a half minutes later, the right
part of the light wall became more faint in both 2796 ˚A
and 1330 ˚A (see panels (a4) and (b4)).

In order to study the change of the light wall and to
explore the corresponding cause(s) behind, we construct
the time-distance plots along slices “A–B” and “C-D”
(marked in Figure 4(a2)), which cross the right and left
parts of the light wall, respectively. Figures 5(a) and

see that, in the 7.5 min interval before 15:18 UT (the

the light wall (exactly the right part of the wall) was
very bright, and its mean height was about 2.1 Mm. The
mean amplitude and oscillation period were about 0.5
Mm and 3.0 min, respectively. After the inﬂuence caused
by the brightening, the light wall became less prominent,
as e.g., the wall height decreased to about 1.5 Mm; the
mean amplitude became 0.2 Mm and the oscillation pe-
riod dropped down to around 2.1 min in the following 8
min. Along slice “C–D”, two time-distance plots, derived
from the SJI 2796 ˚A and 1330 ˚A images, are presented
in Figures 5(c) and 5(d), respectively. The light wall
(in particular, the left part of the wall) before 15:18 UT
appeared as a bright oscillating structure with the oscil-

lation period of about 4 min. Finally, after 15:18 UT,
the light wall suddenly disappeared.

4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
Using IRIS and SDO multi-wavelength observations,
we studied here two oscillating light walls within two ac-
tive regions. Due to the inﬂuence of nearby brightenings,
the brightness of each light wall decayed greatly. For
the ﬁrst light wall, rooted within AR 12565, the average
height, amplitude, and oscillation period signiﬁcantly de-
creased from 3.5 Mm, 1.7 Mm, and 8.5 min to 1.6 Mm,
0.4 Mm, and 3.0 min, respectively. For the second light
wall, rooted within AR 12597, the mean height, ampli-

tude, and oscillation period of the right part of the light
wall decreased from 2.1 Mm, 0.5 Mm, and 3.0 min to
1.5 Mm, 0.2 Mm, and 2.1 min, respectively. Especially,
the left part of the second light wall became invisible af-
ter the inﬂuence of nearby brightening. Our results im-
ply that these two light walls are suppressed by nearby
brightenings.

In the study of Hou et al. (2016b), a light wall in AR
12403 was disturbed by an eruptive ﬂare. The light wall
was suggested to share a group of magnetic lines with
the ﬂaring loops, and the height variation of the light
wall was interpreted with the projection eﬀect due to the
inclination changes. The upward pushing of large-scale
loops lets the light wall turn to the vertical direction,
thus resulting in the increase of the projective height of
the wall. Afterward, the formation of low-lying post-ﬂare
loops makes the light wall seem to be lower in projection
since the light wall inclined. However, in the present
study, there are only some loop brightenings (denoted by
the arrows in Figures 1(c2) and 3(c2)) instead of erup-
tive ﬂares. The loop brightenings seem to be caused by
magnetic reconnection among braided ﬁeld lines, which
is diﬀerent from the eruptive ﬂares with dramatic incli-
nation changes due to the rise of stretching lines and the
formation of post-ﬂare loops. Therefore, the cartoons in
(2016b) cannot be used to explain the de-
Hou et al.
creases of the height, amplitude, oscillation period, and
brightness of the light walls studied in the present work.
Solar ﬂares often eject material from the lower atmo-
sphere into the corona, and some material may fall back
to the solar surface. Yang et al. (2016) noted, when the
falling material reaches the base of a light wall, the ki-
netic energy is converted to thermal energy. The heated
material of the light wall let the wall itself be much
brighter. The pressure at the wall base increases, which
powers the light wall to reach greater heights. Diﬀerent
from the light wall enhancement by falling material, our
results in the present study reveal that the light walls are
suppressed by nearby brightenings. Since the height of a
light wall can be determined by the pressure at the wall
base, applying the logic presented in Yang et al. (2016),
one would expect here a pressure decrease caused by the
nearby brightening. This decrease could be, e.g., due

to a drop in the magnetic pressure, where ﬂux is can-
celled by magnetic reconnection at the site of the nearby
brightening. The intermittent reconnection may cause
the changes of the light wall oscillation periods. Another
opinion may be that the decrease of light walls prop-
erties (e.g., its height) is due to the suppression of the
driver source (p-mode oscillation) itself, resulting from
the nearby hit of downward bulk plasma along recon-
nected brightening loops. Recent studies have revealed
that the magnetic ﬁelds in sunspot light bridges are quite
complex (Louis et al. 2015; Toriumi et al. 2015a, b; Yuan
(2015b)
& Walsh 2016). For example, Toriumi et al.
found that, in the light bridge, the magnetic ﬁeld lines
are highly inclined (almost horizontal to the solar surface
in the direction along the light bridge) and appear as
serpentine or arched structures. Thus, here we propose
that, when the downward propagating bulk plasma hits
the light bridge possessing a complex magnetic topology,
it can not only aﬀect the impact site but also inﬂuences
the nearby light wall rooted in the light bridge. However,
the exact mechanism for the light wall fading is not yet
clear, and to further explore we need more observations
and (MHD) modeling.
