The demonstration of universal quantum logic operations near the fault-tolerance threshold establishes ion-
implanted near-surface donor atoms as a plausible platform for scalable quantum computing in silicon. The next
technological step forward requires a deterministic fabrication method to create large-scale arrays of donors,
featuring few hundred nanometre inter-donor spacing. Here, we explore the feasibility of this approach by
implanting low-energy ions into silicon devices featuring an enlarged 60 × 60 µm2 sensitive area and an ultra-
thin 3.2 nm gate oxide – capable of hosting large-scale donor arrays. By combining a focused ion beam system
incorporating an electron-beam-ion-source with in-vacuum ultra-low noise ion detection electronics, we ﬁrst
demonstrate a versatile method to spatially map the device response characteristics to shallowly implanted
12 keV 1H+
2 ions. Despite the weak internal electric ﬁeld, near-unity charge collection efﬁciency is obtained
from the entire sensitive area. This can be explained by the critical role that the high-quality thermal gate oxide
plays in the ion detection response, allowing an initial rapid diffusion of ion induced charge away from the
implant site. Next, we adapt our approach to perform deterministic implantation of a few thousand 24 keV
40Ar2+ ions into a predeﬁned micro-volume, without any additional collimation. Despite the reduced ionisation
from the heavier ion species, a ﬂuence-independent detection conﬁdence of ≥99.99% was obtained. Our system
thus represents not only a new method for mapping the near-surface electrical landscape of electronic devices,
but also an attractive framework towards mask-free prototyping of large-scale donor arrays in silicon.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Devices based on complementary metal–oxide semicon-
ductor (CMOS) technology, both in established applications
for classical information technology and in emerging appli-
cations for quantum computing, depend on the precise con-
trol of electric ﬁelds in the near-surface region.
In classi-
cal silicon transistors, the source-drain current ﬂowing be-
neath a thin (<10 nm) gate oxide is modulated by the elec-
tric ﬁeld from a surface gate [1]. The current ﬂows in thin
sheets, with the highest density closest to the Si-SiO2 inter-
face [2]. With the transistor size inside modern processors
now approaching 5 nm [3], the concentration of fabrication
defects on the nanoscale has become a critical issue. For
example, local oxide thickness ﬂuctuations, trapped interface
charge, and atomic-scale interface roughness can strongly af-
fect the device internal electric ﬁeld, leading to device relia-
bility issues and breakdown [4, 5]. In devices engineered for
quantum applications, the electronic and nuclear spin of near-
surface (<20 nm deep) donors in silicon can be used to encode
quantum information [6]. Each atom’s quantum state is pro-
grammed and read-out by electric ﬁelds from surface gates
isolated from the substrate by a thin gate oxide [7]. Small-
scale prototype devices have so far demonstrated nuclear co-
herence times exceeding 30 s [8], gate ﬁdelities beyond 99.9%
[9], and more recently, universal quantum logic operations in a

∗ simonr1@student.unimelb.edu.au

three-qubit processor with >99% ﬁdelity [10]. To satisfy sur-
face code error correction speciﬁcations, operational quantum
devices will require a large number (>106) of donors arranged
in a near-surface array [7]. Besides being an enormous fabri-
cation challenge in its own right, careful control of the internal
electric ﬁeld proﬁle is critical for these devices to perform as
intended.

Among the possible fabrication pathways to incorporate
near-surface donors in silicon, scanning probe lithography can
be used to produce few-donor clusters [11] with sub-nm place-
ment precision [12]. An alternative placement approach in-
volves using low-energy ion implantation to produce well-
separated individual donors. Already the industry standard
for fabricating classical CMOS devices [13], we recently ex-
tended this technique with the development of a determinis-
tic ion implantation system that uses the internal electric ﬁeld
within a silicon device to register stochastic arrival-time sin-
gle ion implantation events [14]. The system was used to
demonstrate post-implant counted detection of a few thousand
14 keV P+ ions in Si with 99.85% conﬁdence, using an ion
beam collimated to ∼10 µm diameter by an in-situ microsten-
cil [14]. The inherent uncertainty of each ion’s ﬁnal resting
position in the silicon lattice is furthermore fully compatible
with the constraints of the “ﬂip-ﬂop" qubit architecture [7],
where 100 – 500 nm inter-donor spacing is permitted.

In this work, we investigate the possibility of enhancing
this fabrication method to produce large-area arrays of single
donors spanning tens of µm – a key prerequisite for a large-
scale silicon quantum processor. We employ focused ion
beam (FIB), a well-understood analysis and fabrication tech-

 
 
 
 
 
 
nique that has been used within materials science for decades
[15]. Typically incorporating a Ga liquid-metal ion source
with a ∼5 nm beam spot size, FIB is frequently used for
milling microstructures in a variety of materials [16]. More
recently, the use of light ion sources such as He and Ne has
reduced the beam spot size to <0.5 nm [17], leading to appli-
cations in photonics [18] and quantum materials [19]. Using
a new generation of single ion detectors that feature an ultra-
thin passivation gate oxide plus an enlarged sensitive area suit-
able for spin readout and control of donor arrays [7, 14], we
ﬁrst scan a focussed probe of 12 keV 1H+
2 ions across the
surface and measure the device’s response as a function of
beam position. This technique is commonplace for electrical
device characterisation at few-µm depths using high-energy
MeV ions [20], but here its ﬁrst use in the low keV regime
is demonstrated. As such, this provides a unique method
to evaluate the near-surface (<100 nm) electronic properties.
For devices that meet appropriate quality acceptance criteria,
we then reconﬁgure the system to perform counted 24 keV
40Ar2+ implants into the centre of the sensitive region, with-
out the use of an additional mask, and calculate the ion detec-
tion conﬁdence. This allows us to assess the future suitability
of using the system as a potential new method to construct
donor arrays in silicon.

II. METHODS

A. The Modiﬁed FIB System

Experiments took place using a commercially available FIB
machine (Raith GmbH) that has been modiﬁed for this work
(schematic shown in Fig 1(a)). Full details of the machine
are available in [21]. Brieﬂy, the conventional liquid metal
ion source was replaced with an electron-beam-ion-source
(EBIS) from DREEBIT GmbH [22]. This is a versatile high-
brightness gas plasma source that can produce ions in multi-
ple charge states q = {1, 2, ...} up to complete ionisation [23].
In this study, Arq+ and H+
2 molecule ions were employed.
The base pressure in the ion source chamber was kept below
10−9 mbar. The source potential can vary between 3 – 20 kV,
but was generally set to 12 kV for the these experiments, re-
sulting in a kinetic ion implantation energy of E = q×12 keV.

prise of objective and condenser apertures ranging from 1 –
200 µm in size, selectable via an electrically-driven aperture
stage. An octupole stigmator ensures a circular ion beam pro-
ﬁle. The beam is de-magniﬁed by the FIB lens system, and
can be scanned across the sample stage using the integrated
high-speed pattern generator. The working distance is 10 mm.
Additionally, the interferometrically controlled sample stage
can be positioned to <2 nm accuracy across its entire 200 mm
travel range and provides an alternative precision sample step-
ping method. Coarse lateral ion beam alignment (∼10 µm) is
accomplished by an optical camera, and secondary electron
imaging via an integrated Everhart-Thornley detector enables

2

precision sample alignment to within ∼20 nm. Beam currents
as low as 0.1 – 100 ion/s, compatible with deterministic ion
implantation, are achieved by combining direct ﬁlament cur-
rent control and Wien ﬁlter detuning.

B.

Ion Detection

The ion beam is focused onto a specially-conﬁgured silicon
diode (referred hereafter as a detector) mounted on a minia-
ture preamplifer printed circuit board. The assembly is housed
within a metal case (see Fig. 1(b)) which is ﬁxed to the FIB
sample stage. The detector design incorporates a localised p-
doped top electrode region and a uniform n-doped back con-
tact in 520 µm-thick uniform high purity [001] ﬂoat zone Si
(n-type, 9250 Ω cm) to form a vertical “sandwich type" p–i–n
structure, as shown in Fig. 1(c)-(f). The electrodes are met-
allised with 200 nm-thick Al to form Ohmic contacts for wire
bonding. Ions are designed to be implanted into the centre of
the detector (region A, referred hereafter as the "construction
site", CS), which is covered by a thermally grown passiva-
tion gate oxide of between 3 – 6 nm nominal thickness. The
remainder of the detector surface is covered by a thermally
grown ﬁeld oxide of ∼65 nm thickness (regions C, D, E in
Fig. 1(f)). The top electrode (region B) is surrounded by a
buried ﬂoating n-doped guard ring (region D) to screen against
excess leakage current from surface, interface, and bulk de-
fect states from the surrounding region [24]. Two detector
models are studied in this work: a previous generation incor-
porating four circular CS, each with 20 µm diameter (“Type
I", Fig. 1(d)) and a 5.9 nm-thick gate oxide; and a new gen-
eration utilising a single CS of 60 µm edge length (“Type II",
Fig. 1(e)) with either a 5.2 nm or 3.2 nm-thick gate oxide. Full
details on the general detector design and fabrication process
are described elsewhere [14]. Key properties of the speciﬁc
detectors employed in this work are summarised in Table I.

Each ion impact event is measured using the ion beam in-
duced charge (IBIC) technique [25]. As each ion strikes the
detector, a cascade of electron-hole (e-h) pairs is created along
its deceleration trajectory. The number of e-h pairs produced
in the sensitive silicon detection volume n0 is proportional to
the remaining kinetic ion energy after passing through the ox-
ide passivation “dead" layer E(cid:48) = E − δ E and is made up of
contributions from the primary ion as well as those of respec-
tive recoiled target atoms. Through a process of diffusion and
drift (from the internal electric ﬁeld or with an additional ex-
ternal reverse bias), the e-h pairs become separated. A fraction
may recombine at trapping sites in the silicon bulk as well as at
the Si-SiO2 interface, resulting in n < n0 e-h pairs reaching the
electrodes. By connecting the detector to a charge-sensitive
preampliﬁer circuit, the electrical impulse due to ion-induced
charge movement towards the electrodes can be measured.
The detector’s ion detection ability is typically quantiﬁed by
the charge collection efﬁciency η = n/n0.

In this work, an ultra-low noise preampliﬁer based on the
design of Bertuccio et al.
It incorpo-
rates a forward-biased junction ﬁeld effect transistor (JFET)
[27] which, together with the detector, is mounted on an in-

[26] is employed.

tegrated thermoelectric cooling element (see Fig. 1(b)). The
detector is operated under reverse bias by applying +10 V to
the lower electrode and connecting the top electrode to the
JFET gate via a wire bond. Further signal processing occurs
entirely within the integrated preampliﬁer. Modest cooling
to −10 °C is applied during operation, resulting in a typical
root-mean-square (r.m.s.) noise of ∼70 eV [14]. The pre-
ampliﬁed signal output is then fed into an Amptek PX5 digital
pulse processor [28] which performs trapezoidal pulse shap-
ing (τ = 9.6 µs peaking time), ampliﬁcation, and digitisation.
Channel-to-energy conversion is accomplished by comparing
the ion response against that of a 57Co calibration radionu-
clide that emits characteristic Fe 6.40 keV Kα and 7.06 keV
Kβ X-ray photons. The correlation between the known ion
beam position (provided directly from the FIB pattern gener-
ator) and the detected signal from each ion impact is realised
using a custom-written NI LabVIEW program.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Setup Characterisation

1. FIB Performance

Evaluation of the ion beam proﬁle took place with detec-
tor A-1, where an additional 500 nm of SU-8 resist was de-
posited on the surface and selectively developed into a calibra-
tion pattern using electron beam lithography. A checkerboard
layout with pitch size ranging from 4 – 0.5 µm was formed
inside the CS, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The detector was sub-
sequently placed inside the FIB machine, where a 6 keV 1H+
2
beam was then scanned over a 10 × 10 µm2 area inside the
CS. Light ions are employed for the initial characterisation be-
cause they produce less sample damage and greater ionisation
than heavier species for the same kinetic energy [20]. Each
1H+
2 molecule ion dissociates quasi-instantaneously upon sur-
face impact, due to the energy transfer exceeding the binding
energy by several orders of magnitude [29]. The constituent
ions share the total kinetic energy in equal parts (3 keV per
H+) and decelerate simultaneously inside the detector. Ions
that strike areas protected by the resist cannot produce signal
pulses, as its thickness is large enough to prevent incident ions
from entering the sensitive detector volume [30]. In resist-free
areas, the average penetration depth is ∼47 nm below the Si-
SiO2 interface, and a combined sum of 1560 e-h pairs is pro-
duced per H+
2 ion [30]. The shallow implantation depth com-
pared to the overall detector thickness causes the IBIC signal

olution limit of our system. An even smaller spot size can be
obtained by further reducing the FIB aperture size to below
100 nm, despite a predicted <1 fA beam current that would
not provide sufﬁcient statistics for conventional secondary
electron-generated images. Custom-fabricated nanoapertures
are currently under evaluation for this purpose [34].

Ion Energy Measurement & Mapping

To conﬁrm correct operation of the system, a 12 keV 1H+
2
ion beam was scanned over a detector with a previously-
measured response to similar energy 1H+
2 ions [14] (detector
B-1, Type I) and the signal pulse amplitudes were recorded.
In the absence of incident ions, a r.m.s. noise of ∼110 eV was
measured. This is about 40 eV greater than other detectors
from the same wafer [14] and can be attributed to an addi-
tional capacitance at the JFET input gate from a second de-
tector that was connected in parallel during this experiment.
However, this is sufﬁcient for high conﬁdence low-energy sin-
gle ion detection, as discussed later. A total of 10, 000 sin-
gle ion impact events were recorded, with the resulting signal
pulse spectrum shown in Fig. 3(a). The spectrum is domi-
nated by a broad main peak centred at 2.5 keV, with a fraction
of its lower energy side cut off due to the noise discrimina-
tor threshold. On the high-energy side, a separate small sig-
nal peak occurs at 5.8 keV and approximately 700 eV FWHM.
One further isolated small peak, centred at 11.3 keV and ap-
proximately 600 eV FWHM, can also be identiﬁed.

The corresponding spatially-resolved charge signal pulse
map is shown in Fig. 3(b) and reveals the origin of each peak.
Each pixel is colour-coded according to the charge collection
efﬁciency η determined from the pulse recorded at the given
location. The overall map features agree well with the optical
top-view micrograph of the same device shown in Fig. 1(d).
As expected, the isolated highest-energy signal peak origi-
nates inside the CS array (region A in Fig. 1(f)). Here, the
initial ion energy loss from stopping in the thin gate oxide (see
Table I) is nearly negligible. Along with the low bulk defect
concentration in the high-purity silicon wafer and the high-
quality thermal gate oxide interface [14, 35], this maximises
the number of e-h pairs produced in the sensitive volume, re-
sulting in η ≈ 1. For a 12 keV H+
2 molecule ion, ∼95% of
its kinetic energy is dissipated in electronic stopping by e-h
pair generation according to the model of Funsten and Ziegler
[30, 36]. With the signal peak centre located at ∼11.3 keV,
our results are consistent with this model, and also with pre-
vious experimental results obtained with a collimated beam
from a conventional plasma-ﬁlament ion source [14], thus
conﬁrming the correct functionality of our system. Additional
spectra obtained from independently scanning each individual
CS are also shown in Fig. 3(c). There appears to be minimal
variation in η between each CS, and the absence of isolated
events outside the main signal peak indicates negligible artiﬁ-
cial inﬂuences – e.g. from ion scattering or gate oxide effects
such as thickness ﬂuctuations and surface debris.

Outside of the CS, the top metal electrode pad (region B)
yields no single ion detection events, agreeing with TRIM

ion impact event. The ion impact rate was approximately 20 ion/s and
the dwell time was ﬁxed at 8 ms. Objective and condenser aperture
sizes were set to 1 µm and 10 µm, respectively. (c) Linescan extracted

pulse to be dominated by electron drift towards the back elec-
trode, whereas holes contribute to only a minor degree [31].

Fig. 2(b) demonstrates a spatially-resolved map of ion-
induced signal events captured with optimised FIB column
parameters. A comparison against the actual calibration pat-
tern visualised via scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 2(a))
shows that the overall shape appears well-reproduced by the
system. The majority of detected ion impact events originate
from resist-free areas, and the pattern aspect ratio is preserved,
indicating optimised ion beam stigmator settings. However,
some residual scattered events are also seen to occur within
resist-covered areas. To better understand this ﬁnding, in-
tensity line proﬁles were extracted from the ion impact event
map, with an example shown in Fig. 2(c). The left-hand edge
of each plateau (with respect to Fig. 2(c)) appears to have a
consistently greater spread than the right-hand edge, with this
highly directional behaviour indicating unwanted residual FIB
coma effects. This can be addressed by further ﬁne adjustment
of the ion optical alignment [21]. The beam spot of the system
was thus determined by ﬁtting an error function to the unaf-
fected right-hand edge. An average FWHM of (181 ± 14) nm
was obtained along an extended edge feature. This is a sub-
stantial improvement over other EBIS-based FIB machines,
where values of between 500 – 1000 nm have been reported
[23, 32, 33]. However, this does not represent the lower res-

2 molecule ions
should stop completely within the metal layer [30]. Next, the
narrow undoped region between the top electrode and the n-
guard ring (region C) gives rise to the satellite signal peak lo-
cated at 6 keV. Here, the ions experience increased stopping
in the thicker ﬁeld oxide (see Table I) and lose approximately
half of their initial kinetic energy before reaching the sensi-
tive detector volume [30]. Hence, only approximately half the
number of e-h pairs is generated in this region, compared to
in region A. Further, no signal events are recorded within the
n-guard ring area (region D) due to the very high phosphorous
doping concentration (3 × 1019 cm−3), representing a volume
of very effective e-h pair recombination.

Finally, the outer area (region E) yields the dominant signal
peak in Fig. 3(a), with the peak size coming from its rela-
tively large area fraction of the detector. Here, the n-guard
ring strongly attenuates the internal reverse bias drift ﬁeld,
rendering the slower charge carrier diffusion process (minor-
ity carrier lifetimes typically ∼100 ns, compared to ps drift
times [37]) as the dominant transport mechanism. The spa-
tially isotropic nature of e-h pair diffusion, combined with
lifetime-limiting interface and bulk defects, results in a quick
decline of η with growing lateral distance from the n-guard
edge. However, we emphasise that ions are not actually de-
signed to be implanted and detected in this region. Instead,
the earlier result showing η → 1 within each CS (region A) is
the key conclusion to draw from this initial experiment.

B. Defect Measurement and Analysis

Turning to our application to silicon donor-based quantum
computing, we now evaluate Type II detectors incorporating
a large-area CS needed to host large-scale donor arrays. We
will test the key array formation requirement: all implanted
ions must be able to be detected with a high degree of conﬁ-
dence at their predeﬁned target locations. More precisely, η
must meet two criteria in the CS: (1) the average value must be
near-unity, and (2) it must be spatially homogeneous. As pre-
viously introduced, the IBIC technique is inherently sensitive
to defects located in the bulk [39, 40] and at interfaces [41, 42]
that act as trapping/recombination centres for ion-induced free
e-h pairs. Especially for criterion (2), local effects such as gate
oxide thickness ﬂuctuations or residual nanoscale surface de-
bris can contribute towards increased ion stopping before an
ion reaches the sensitive detector volume, leading to highly
localised areas of reduced η. This cannot be readily evaluated
with broad-beam ion implantation, and instead a scanned fo-
cused ion microprobe must be used. Furthermore, low kinetic
energy keV ions are needed (unlike in conventional MeV IBIC
experiments [20]) to ensure that a similar depth scale to that
used for eventual donor array ion implants is probed.

To evaluate the presence of such defects, two representa-
tive detectors from the same fabrication wafer (see Fig. 4(a)
and (b)) were selected at random and mapped with a scanned
12 keV H+
2 beam. Fig. 4(c) shows a high-resolution map of
η in detector C-1. The CS exhibits ideal signal characteristics
and clearly fulﬁlls both criteria. A linescan taken diagonally

along its cross-section (Fig. 4(e)) conﬁrms ﬂuctuations in η
of < 3%. These can be attributed to the statistical nature of a
multi-atom collision cascade each ion experiences, due to (i)
variations in the residual kinetic ion energy after transmitting
the gate oxide, (ii) variations in the electronic ion stopping
fraction in the sensitive region, and (iii) Fano statistics of e-h
pair generation due to electron and hole scattering in the sil-
icon lattice [43]. This is also the origin of the signal peak
width visible in Fig. 3(c). The sharp decrease in η at the CS
perimeter is due to a sudden transition between the gate oxide
and the thicker surrounding ﬁeld oxide.

The situation is markedly different for detector C-2. As
shown in Fig. 4(d) and (e), three distinct regions of different
η are observable within the CS. The right-hand third (region I)
exhibits comparably uniform signal characteristics with near-
unity η, similar to detector C-1. However, the remaining re-
gions indicate the presence of defects. Two pockets of de-
graded η < 0.5 occur at the top and in the centre of the CS
(region II). They span approximately 10 × 20 µm in lateral di-
mensions. In the left-hand third of the CS (region III), a more
uniform spatial detector response is apparent, albeit with a re-
duced average η ≈ 0.9. To better understand the charge col-
lection dynamics, a COMSOL® simulation [38] of the electric
ﬁeld E inside an ideal (η = 1) detector was run, with the re-
sults shown in Fig. 4(f). E is largely uniform and vertically

Dit = 1 × 1011 cm−2eV−1 and a ﬁxed oxide charge of Q f = 1 × 109 cm−2 were assumed in the gate oxide. The white dot at the image centre

2 ions according to TRIM calculations [30]. (g) Topography map of detector

aligned deep inside the detector, but increasingly re-aligns
horizontally in the vicinity of the surface. This is accompa-
nied by a lateral gradient in the absolute ﬁeld strength, with a
near ﬁeld-free region existing in the centre of the CS to a depth
of a few µm. This is many times the ion implantation depth
((88 ± 30) nm [30]), suggesting that in this region, the motion
of ion-generated free e-h pairs is initially characterised by dif-
fusion and only afterwards becomes dominated by drift trans-
port in the deeper silicon bulk. Remarkably, a high-quality Si
crystal with no obvious point/extended defects (see Fig. 1(g))
and a well-passivated surface from a high-quality thermal ox-
ide [44] appears sufﬁcient to create an environment with dif-
fusion lengths spanning tens of µm, as exhibited by detector
C-1. This is clearly not the case in detector C-2.

The shallow ion probing depth suggests that the physical
origin of the defective regions in detector C-2 may be surface-
related. Atomic force microscopy was thus performed in the
affected area of the CS, as indicated in Fig. 4(d)). The cor-
responding topography map is shown in Fig. 4(g). A hairline
crack extending from the top corner to the centre of the CS
can be identiﬁed, with lateral dimensions varying between a
few hundred nm to a few µm. In some areas, the crack has a
depth of up to 4 nm. This is comparable to the thermal gate
oxide thickness, suggesting that an error during the fabrication
process (e.g. residual surface debris present during spin coat-
ing or a mechanical scratch from wafer handling) resulted in
its local etching. The complete removal of a thermally-grown

oxide and subsequent exposure of the underlying silicon ma-
terial leads to the formation of a low-quality native oxide (2
– 3 nm thickness), typically characterised by defect interface
trap densities Dit > 1013 cm−2eV−1 and ﬁxed oxide charge
densities Qf > 1012 cm−2 [45]. These values lie about two
orders of magnitude higher than those measured in a typical
thermal gate oxide [35, 46], thus representing a concentrated
region of effective e-h pair trapping and recombination. The
corresponding signal pulse map (Fig. 4(d)) clearly reﬂects a
reduced charge carrier lifetime in and around this damaged re-
gion, where only 20 – 50 % of the ion-induced e-h pairs are
collected at the detector electrodes.

The non-uniform ion detection response exhibited by detec-
tor C-2 therefore makes this device unsuited to its proposed
application in large-scale donor array formation for silicon
quantum computing, clearly demonstrating the crucial need
for a low interface density passivation thermal oxide in next-
generation silicon quantum computing devices. However, this
appears to be an isolated case, with other detectors from the
same wafer also tested (not shown) and conﬁrmed to be ﬁt
for purpose. Moreover, these results demonstrate the utility
that a scanned keV ion probe provides in understanding and
troubleshooting the near-surface device behaviour. The versa-
tility of this system should also be pointed out in allowing not
only analysis of silicon-based electronic devices, but poten-
tially those based on other IBIC-compatible platforms, such
as SiC, diamond, and III-V materials [20].

C. Mask-Free Deterministic Ion Implantation

We now turn our attention towards reconﬁguring the setup
to enable future controlled implantation of individual 31P+
ions for use in spin-based quantum computing. In these exper-
iments, 24 keV 40Ar2+ ions (acceleration potential = 12 kV)
were employed. Each ion now penetrates only (28 ± 13) nm
below the Si-SiO2 interface and generates an average of
∼1700 e−h pairs in the active detection volume [30]. Al-
though the electronic and spin properties of 40Ar do not make
it compatible with quantum information processing in sili-
con, its ion stopping characteristics are very similar to the 31P
donor-qubit [48], providing a good estimate of the ion detec-
tion signal response and thus allowing a robust assessment of
further adapting the FIB setup for this ultimate purpose.

In a large-scale quantum computing device incorporating
surface control gates [7, 49], it is important to minimise the
depth placement uncertainty (longitudinal straggle) of each
donor. Too deep placement results in poor spin-dependent
tunnel coupling of the donor electron, whereas too shallow
placement causes the donor to be located adjacent to or in
the oxide and consequently inactivated. The straggle can
be reduced by lowering the implantation energy (see Table
II). However, this also reduces the number of ion-induced e-
h pairs and thus causes the amplitude of each charge pulse
signal to lie near the noise threshold, thereby increasing the
likelihood of > 1 donor per implant site. The net result is a
reduced ensemble coherence time from uncontrolled nearby
donor-donor coupling. The solution is to reach an optimum
balance between the placement uncertainty and the ion de-
tection conﬁdence Ξ(qt0), deﬁned as the fraction of detected
single ion events (counts above the noise discriminator thresh-
old qt0) to the total number of incident ions [14]. To predict
Ξ(qt0), a 5 × 5 µm2 area located at the centre of the CS (left
inset of Fig. 5) in detector C-1 was continuously scanned with
a 24 keV Ar2+ beam until 2000 signal events were recorded.
The resulting signal pulse spectrum is shown in Fig. 5. Com-
pared to 1H+, the heavier mass of 40Ar2+ results in only 25 %
of the initial ion kinetic energy being dissipated into electronic
stopping [36], shifting the peak centroid down to ∼6.1 keV.
The peak also appears broader due to a greater statistical vari-
ation in the fraction of electronic energy loss of each ion.
Nevertheless, a clear interval between the lowest detected
count (at 2.5 keV) and the noise discrimination threshold (at
0.64 keV) lacking any signal events is seen, strongly suggest-
ing that 100% of the incident ions were successfully detected.

A robust assessment of Ξ(qt0) is done by comparing the ex-
perimentally obtained signal pulse spectrum with that gener-
ated by a Crystal-TRIM simulation [47] for an ideal (η = 1)
silicon detector with the same gate oxide thickness. Good
agreement between the experimental and simulated spectra
is observed, allowing us to extract a detection conﬁdence of
Ξ(qt0) ≥ 99.99%. The effect of the accumulated ion ﬂuence
on the signal pulse spectrum [50] was additionally consid-
ered by comparing the ﬁrst and last 200 detected events, as
shown in the right inset of Fig. 5. Within the statistical un-
certainty of the two sub-spectra, no evidence of a systematic
peak shift or broadening is seen, suggesting that even moder-
ate ion-induced crystal damage (average Ar2+ inter-ion spac-
ing = 112 nm) does not lead to a signiﬁcant degradation in η.
Compared to our previous detector generations incorporat-
ing a standard 6 – 8 nm gate oxide [14], detector C-1 fea-
tures an ultra-thin 3.2 nm gate oxide (see Fig. 1(g)). Simi-
lar CMOS devices incorporating sub-5 nm gate oxides have
been shown to be susceptible to elevated defect concentra-
tions [51]. However, the near-unity η value obtained here
suggests that the density of interface defect traps and ﬁxed
oxide charge within this ultra-thin gate oxide is in fact compa-
rable to that measured in previous-generation devices [8, 10].
A thin gate oxide also provides an improved controlled silicon
doping yield Ydop, deﬁned as the fraction of detectable single
ion impacts where the primary dopant ion also entirely trans-
mits the gate oxide to stop inside the silicon crystal. Events
where the primary ion stops inside the oxide may still produce
a detectable signal, because forward-recoiled Si and O atoms
from the oxide can also contribute to an overall charge sig-
nal pulse event. These events appear to be extremely rare for
this detector generation, with Crystal-TRIM simulations [47]
predicting Ydop = 99.95% for 24 keV Ar2+ ions. In a previous
detector generation, we reported a single ion detection conﬁ-
dence of Ξ(qt0) = 99.85% for 14 keV 31P+ ions, but the actual
doping yield was limited to Ydop = 98.1%, due to 1.9% of the
incident 31P+ ions stopping inside the 6 nm gate oxide [14].
Based on the current results obtained with argon ions for this
new detector generation, we expect a factor 5 enhancement to
Ydop = 99.62 % for 14 keV 31P+ ions, comfortably exceeding
the latest estimates of tolerable donor qubit loss fault thresh-
olds (90 – 95 %) [52]. The installation of a 31P+ ion source is
forthcoming.

The lateral placement accuracy of each implanted ion is the
additional component in determining our setup’s suitability
for scalable donor array fabrication in silicon, and can be split

into two independent scattering processes. First, the uncer-
tainty of each ion’s lateral impact point on the detector sur-
face comes from the ﬁxed spot size of the FIB. Second, lateral
ion straggling takes place inside the target material (see Table
II) as a direct result of the random collision cascade each ion
makes with target atoms upon stopping. Although the present
181 nm (FWHM) spot size is not compatible with the sub-
50 nm lateral donor placement constraints of the ﬂip-ﬂop qubit
architecture [7], we expect a further spot size reduction to
<30 nm to be realistically achievable by employing custom-
fabricated 100 nm diameter lens apertures [34], as mentioned
earlier. In this regime, effects from the spot size and the lateral
ion straggling in silicon should contribute more or less equally
to the overall ion placement precision. Furthermore, the ex-
pected reduction in beam current from the smaller aperture
size can be offset by the highly adjustable nature of the EBIS
emission intensity, yielding a similar expected on-target im-
plantation rate to that used in the present experiments. Preci-
sion localisation of single ions has already been demonstrated
with a masked approach, where a nanoaperture was milled in
the tip of an atomic force microscope cantilever and placed di-
rectly above the sample to collimate the beam [53]. However,
adapting this technique below the 30 nm level may be techni-
cally challenging due to expected lateral and axial ion strag-
gling effects from the aperture. Particularly for high aspect
ratio nanoapertures, an unacceptably large proportion of ions
can be implanted hundreds of nm away from their intended
target locations [54]. This effect can also be aggravated by
the accumulated ion ﬂuence seen by the cantilever, whereby
the nanoaperture can shrink and eventually completely close
over time [53, 55]. The use of a mask-less, focused implanta-
tion method, such as the FIB system employed in this work,
may present a viable avenue around this.

Our system also has the advantage that highly charged ions
(up to completely ionised) can readily be supplied by the
EBIS. Especially for heavy donors such as 123Sb and 209Bi,
the additional potential energy deposited by these ions in the
detector [56] can be utilised as an additional means to artiﬁ-
cially increase Ξ(qt0). Alongside encouraging recent studies
from systems that detect single ions just prior to the implanta-
tion event [57, 58], our results represent a promising alterna-
tive avenue towards the scalable engineering of near-surface
donor qubit arrays with nanoscale placement precision.

tive area and an ultra-thin 3.2 nm gate oxide, we ﬁrst spatially
map the internal electric ﬁeld to within 100 nm of the surface
using a rastered 12 keV 1H+
2 ion probe. The results highlight
the destructive effect that localised regions of defect-rich na-
tive oxide play in suppressing the detection response, whereby
>50% of the initially diffused charge can be lost to associated
interface states. Nevertheless, near-unity charge collection ef-
ﬁciency is measured in the sensitive area of functional detec-
tors, thus conﬁrming our devices are ﬁt for purpose. Next, we
modify the system to perform counted implantation of 2000
40Ar2+ ions at 24 keV into a pre-deﬁned 5 × 5 µm2 area, ob-
taining ≥99.99% single ion detection conﬁdence. This ap-
proach foregoes the need for an mechanical implant mask that
may introduce additional ion scattering. With an upcoming
system upgrade to incorporate a 31P+ ion source and yield a
sub-30 nm FIB spot size, we aim to establish a viable method
to fabricate large-scale near-surface 31P donor arrays in sili-
con for multi-qubit entanglement studies.

We have introduced a FIB system equipped with an
electron-beam-ion-source as well as ultra-low noise single ion
detection technology to enable deterministic control over the
number and position of implanted ions. The highly adjustable
source can produce ions with energies between 3 – 300 keV,
implanted at rates between 0.1 – 100 ion/s, focused down to a
spot size of 180 nm (FWHM). Through the ion beam induced
charge principle, we use silicon p–i–n diode detectors to mea-
sure electron-hole pairs generated by each ion impact event
and correlate this with the beam position. Using a new gener-
ation of ion detectors featuring an enlarged 60 × 60 µm2 sensi-
