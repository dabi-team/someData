ABSTRACT

By using a new method of forced-ﬁeld extrapolation, we study the

emerging ﬂux region AR 11850 observed by the Interface Region Imag-

ing Spectrograph (IRIS) and Solar Dynamical Observatory (SDO).

Our results suggest that the bright points (BPs) in this emerging region have

responses in lines formed from the upper photosphere to the transition region,

with a relatively similar morphology. They have an oscillation of several

minutes according to the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) data at

1600 and 1700 ˚A . The ratio between the BP intensities measured in

1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A ﬁltergrams reveals that these BPs are heated dif-

ferently. Our analysis of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) vector

magnetic ﬁeld and the corresponding topology in AR11850 indicates that the

BPs are located at the polarity inversion line (PIL) and most of them related

with magnetic reconnection or cancelation. The heating of the BPs might

be diﬀerent due to diﬀerent magnetic topology. We ﬁnd that the heat-

ing due to the magnetic cancelation would be stronger than the case of bald

patch reconnection. The plasma density rather than the magnetic ﬁeld strength

could play a dominant role in this process. Based on physical conditions in

the lower atmosphere, our forced-ﬁeld extrapolation shows consistent results

between the bright arcades visible in slit-jaw image (SJI) 1400 ˚A and

the extrapolated ﬁeld lines that pass through the bald patches. It provides a re-

liable observational evidence for testing the mechanism of magnetic reconnection

for the BPs and arcades in emerging ﬂux region, as proposed in simulation

works.

Introduction

Prevalent energy releases can occur in the solar atmosphere in a large range of

scales from solar ﬂares to small energy release events. Solar ﬂares have been extensively

studied (Parker 1981; Phillips 1991; Schrijver 2009; Milligan 2015; Janvier et al. 2015, and

the references therein) as it is the most energetic phenomenon and frequently accompanied

by coronal mass ejection, which may inﬂuence the space weather and even our earth. The

small-scale energy release events happen more frequently and have been named as micro-

and nanoﬂares, bright points (BPs), blinkers. They have been observed by diﬀerent

instruments (Schmieder et al. 1995; Parnell et al. 2002; Aschwanden 2004) in

diﬀerent wavelengths from visible to soft X-ray. They have important impacts

on the heating mechanisms of the solar atmosphere. Such events take place in diﬀerent

atmospheric layers from the photosphere to the corona (Harrison 1997; Berger et al.

2007; Chandrashekhar et al. 2013), and ubiquitous in active regions, quiet Sun and coronal

holes (Shimizu 1995; Zhang et al. 2001; Kamio et al. 2011). With the ground-based and

space telescopes, photospheric BPs are often studied to investigate the condition

of the convective ﬂows in and below the photosphere (Feng et al. 2013; Jafarzadeh et al.

2014; Yang et al. 2015, 2016; Ji et al. 2016a,b). These ﬂows are widely accepted to be the

ultimate source of the energy; coronal BPs as well as coronal loops are also frequently

discussed (Li et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2014; Alipour & Safari 2015; Chesny et al. 2015;

Mou et al. 2016) as they were thought to be the most potential candidates for coronal

heating.

In fact, the energy coming from the solar convection region heats the solar atmosphere

through the stressing of the magnetic ﬁeld lines, and manifests itself as waves and current

sheets leading to reconnection (see review in Schmieder et al. 2014). The anomalous high

temperature in the corona is one manifestation of this process. The temperature of the

– 4 –

chromosphere is not as high as that of the corona because of its higher density. Hence, we

need to study the atmosphere as an entirety to understand the heating process (such as

Schmieder 1997; Schmieder et al. 2004; Li et al. 2007; Zhao & Li 2012), and particularly

pay attention to the phenomena happening in the chromosphere and transition region.

Previous diagnostic work have been done on the small-scale energy release events

in this interface region (Schmieder 1997; Pariat et al. 2004, 2006, 2007; Tian et al. 2010;

Chen & Ding 2010; Brosius & Holman 2010; Brosius 2013; Leiko & Kondrashova 2015),

with limited wavelengths, resolution, sensitivity or observation time. The recently

launched Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS, De Pontieu et al. 2014b), which

provided images and spectrum with considerably high temporal and spatial resolution,

has opened a new window for investigating the small-scale energy release events in the

interface region. Some impressive ﬁndings (Hansteen et al. 2014; De Pontieu et al. 2014a;

Tian et al. 2014; Peter et al. 2014; Rouppe van der Voort et al. 2015; Vissers et al. 2015)

and more speciﬁc works (Huang et al. 2014; Mart´ınez-Sykora et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2015;

Park et al. 2016; Skogsrud et al. 2016; Brooks et al. 2016) have been introduced. Most of

them have focused on the transition region loops, torsional motions, solar spicules, bright

grains, explosive events, Ellerman bombs (EBs) and the hot bombs which turn out to be

the analogies of EBs (Tian et al. 2016). Such phenomena have been studied in details,

including their spectrum, temperature, morphology, lifetime. However, no direct analysis of

the related magnetic ﬁeld has been done yet.

Although it is still not clear whether waves or reconnection play a dominant role

in heating the solar atmosphere, it is well accepted that the solar plasma, which is ionized

due to the high temperature, is highly coupled to the magnetic ﬁeld. An evidence is the

dominance of the structured magnetic ﬁeld associated with the inhomogeneities

of the emission in the solar corona. Hence, the magnetic topology, especially the special

– 5 –

features such as null points, separatrix surfaces, separators as well as quasi-separatrix layers

(QSLs), is considered to be important for studying the atmospheric heating. The magnetic

ﬁeld associated with the BPs can be achieved thanks to the availability of high quality

vector magnetograms, and the advanced reconstruction method of the coronal

force-free magnetic ﬁeld. As a result, the coronal BPs and the associated magnetic

features have been well studied in the tenuous and highly ionized coronal plasma where

magnetic reconnection can occur easily (such as Zhang et al. 2012; Ning & Guo 2014). A

bunch of work have made some approximations in studying the interface brightenings with

the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds (such as Pariat et al. 2007; Li & Ning 2012; Jiang et al.

2015; Li & Zhang 2016)

Several simulation work have studied the heating of the solar atmosphere from

convection zone to the corona (Potts et al. 2007; Pariat et al. 2009; Jiang et al. 2010, 2012;

Ni et al. 2015a,b, 2016), yet the investigation of the magnetic features in real physical

conditions is considerably insuﬃcient in the lower atmosphere. Schmieder & Aulanier

(2003) discussed the linear force-free-ﬁeld (LFFF) method in emerging active region and

also its limitation. In Feng et al. (2007), they even pointed out the inadequacy of the LFFF

extrapolation in the corona by comparing with their reliable coronal loop reconstruction.

Pariat et al. (2004, 2006) studied the emergence of a magnetic ﬂux tube and the heating

during this process. Their LFFF extrapolation result suggests that the impulsive heating

may happen not only at the locations of the bald patches but also at the footpoints

and along the ﬁeld lines that passing through these bald patches. Valori et al. (2012)

focused on the entire process of the ﬂux emergence, from the ﬁrst appearance of the

magnetic signature in the photosphere, until the formation of the main bipole of the

active region. They adopted the non-linear force-free-ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolation based

on the magneto-frictional method to construct the three-dimensional magnetic ﬁeld in the

emerging ﬂux region. Hong et al. (2016) studied a micro-ﬂare in the chromosphere with

– 6 –

the spectra measured by the New Solar Telescope (NST; Goode et al. 2003) at Big

Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) and extrapolated magnetic ﬁelds from Helioseismic and

Magnetic Imager (HMI; Scherrer et al. 2012) with a NLFFF approach (Wheatland

2004; Wiegelmann & Inhester 2010). However, the force-free assumption inside these

work is probably not consistent with the physical conditions in the lower atmosphere. In

fact, all the NLFFF extrapolation methods encounter more or less the following

diﬃculties in the investigation of the magnetic ﬁeld in the interface region: Firstly,

the plasma in the lower atmosphere is partially ionized and with high density. In the

chromosphere the plasma beta ﬂuctuates a lot and can be either above or bellow 1, which

makes it much more sophisticated in analyzing the initiation and driving mechanism of

the reconnection. Secondly, the magnetic ﬁeld in the lower atmosphere, which is ﬁlled

with short and low-lying loops, is much more complex than in the corona. Thirdly, the

Lorentz force is nonzero, hence the force-free assumption used in the extrapolation

is invalid. Therefore in this paper we applied a new forced-ﬁeld extrapolation

method based on a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) relaxation method developed

recently by Zhu et al. (2013), which has already shown their advantages in Zhu et al.

(2016).

In this work, we investigate the magnetic topology of the BPs happening in between

an emerging ﬂux region observed by the Solar Dynamical Observatory (SDO) and IRIS.

A new method of the forced-ﬁeld extrapolation is adopted (Zhu et al. 2013). This paper

is organized as follows: the observations are introduced in Section 2 and extrapolation in

Section 3. We discuss our results and make conclusions in Section 4.

2. Observations

2.1. Overview of the Active Region

NOAA AR11850 appears at the location of E24◦N8◦ on September 24, 2013. It is

an emerging ﬂux region and consists of three dispersed spots (Figure 1a). The

AR11850 has been captured by telescopes both in the space and on the ground, which makes

it a suitable region for analyzing the successive heating of the solar atmosphere. There

are many BPs appearing in between this active region, Peter et al. (2014) studied four of

them and considered them as ”hot explosions”; Grubecka et al. (2016) made statistics on

the compact BPs observed in this region.

The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument (Lemen et al. 2012) onboard

SDO satellite obtains full-disk images in UV and EUV wavelengths and monitors the

atmosphere from the chromosphere to the corona with high spatial resolution (0.6 arcsec per

pixel) and continuous temporal coverage. The IRIS mission (De Pontieu et al. 2014b)

obtains UV spectra and images of the chromosphere and transition region, with a

spectral resolution of respectively ≈ 26 and ≈ 52 m˚A according to the wavelength range,

and a spatial resolution of 0.33 – 0.4 arcsec for the images. IRIS observed AR11850

with a FOV of 141 arcsec × 175 arcsec for the raster and 166 arcsec × 175

arcsec for the image.

The cadence of the slit-jaw images (SJI) in the Si IV 1400 ˚A ﬁlter is 12 seconds.

Images using the rasters can be obtained in 20 minutes (ﬁrst interval is 11:44 – 12:04 UT

and second interval 15:39 –15:59 UT) on September 24, 2013. We will mainly use the SJI

1400 ˚A observed at 11:52 UT and the spectrogram in the Mg II h line wing at 2803.5 +1 ˚A

scanned from 11:50 to 12:01 UT in the ﬁrst time interval of observations and covering

only the emerging ﬂux region.

– 8 –

2.2. Observations by IRIS and SDO/AIA

Since we are mostly interested in the initial phase of the emerging process when the

ﬂux tubes pass through the lower solar atmosphere, especially through the photosphere, we

mainly investigate the observations of this emerging ﬂux region in UV wavelengths.

For a context of AR 11850, we present the HMI continuum intensity and

photospheric magnetogram in Figure 1 (a) and (c) to show the magnetic conﬁguration in

this region. The images of diﬀerent UV wavelengths are shown in Figure 1 (b) and (d), in

IRIS spectrogram at 2804.5 ˚A from 11:50 to 12:01 UT and SJI 1400 ˚A at 11:52 UT, with

approximated formation temperatures of 104.0 and 104.8 kelvin, respectively. In both UV

images, there are several well-pronounced BPs in the moss between the magnetic polarities,

which are outlined by red contours. A bunch of plasma loops can also be recognized in

1400 ˚A image, which might correspond to the arch ﬁlament system (AFS) in Hα (refer

to Grubecka et al. 2016), with their feet rooted at some of the aforementioned BPs.

In SJI 1400 ˚A there are 19 bright points between magnetic polarities in this active

region with a threshold value of 20 times above the Ismean, while in 2804.5 ˚A there are 50

bright points with a threshold value of 1.6 times above the Immean. The values of Ismean

and Immean represent the mean intensity in a relatively quiet region indicated by the

rectangular white box in Si IV and Mg II images, respectively.

Most of the intense BPs that appear in 2804.5 ˚A have a counterpart in SJI 1400 ˚A

although they are not outlined by red contours due to the contour level that we have selected

to avoid mixing of BPs and bright loops. In the magnetogram, we have increased the

contrast to enhance the small-scaled dipoles between the spots. The relationship

between the bright points and magnetic dipoles will be studied in detail later.

The UV images at other wavelengths, such as AIA 1600 and 1700 ˚A are

shown in Figure 2. The 1700 ˚A emission (UV continuum) forms around the

– 9 –

temperature minimum region of 103.7 kelvin, while the 1600 ˚A emission contains

UV emission like 1700 ˚A and also the emission of C IV line 1548 ˚A formed

in the transition region temperature. Complementary images from IRIS are

also displaced here. These four images reveal the atmosphere response to the

magnetic ﬂux emergence from photosphere to the transition region. The images

from the diﬀerent satellites are coaligned through the alignment of speciﬁc features. The

contours of 1600 ˚A intensity image are overlaid on IRIS 2804.5 ˚A and AIA 1700 ˚A images.

It implies that all the images are coaligned quite well. A large number of BPs can be

identiﬁed in the moss between the spots in 1600 and 1700 ˚A images.

Among these BPs, we selected several brightest ones A-I by visual inspection of

their brightness in IRIS 1400 ˚A and present them with rectangular box in Figure 3. All

the selected BPs have their counterparts in AIA 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A. This result suggests

that the BPs are heated in the atmosphere from the photosphere to the transition region.

In order to compare the morphology of these BPs, we overlay the contours of AIA 1600 ˚A

(2.2 times above the mean value) and AIA 1700 ˚A (1.4 times above the mean value) on

the spectrogram of 2804.5 ˚A for every single BP in Figure 4. We notice that most of the

BPs have a similar morphology, with a more diﬀuse shape in the AIA observations. As

mentioned in Vissers et al. (2015) and Tian et al. (2016), the BPs observed in

Mg II line wing commonly have a counterpart in the wings of Hα like the EBs.

It indicates that the BPs marked in the boxes maybe associated with EBs.

We present the evolution of selected BPs in 1600 ˚A in Figure 5 and in 1700 ˚A in

Figure 6. The images record the BPs evolution for 16 minutes from 11:46 UT to 12:04

UT. The black contours outline the BPs in this rectangular region and the black arrow

points out the speciﬁc one that we are interested in. The morphology of BP A and B

seems to be diﬀerent in 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A while the others are similar. The shape of

– 10 –

these BPs always changes during the 18 minutes. The white rectangular boxes show the

times when the slit of IRIS scans through these BPs. We calculated the intensity ratio

between 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A at these speciﬁc times (Table 1). All ratios are greater

than unity except for BP I. These ratios imply that there is a contribution of C IV

emission in the BPs. The more the ratio is greater than unit, the more the contribution

comes from C IV. Hence, we could ﬁnd that the C IV emission contributes much more in

BPs A , B and E, less for C, D, F and almost no for the others (G to L). It means that the

temperature of the BPs A to F is higher than that of the others. This is consistent with the

results of Grubecka et al. (2016), who found signatures in Si IV spectra only for the BPs

corresponding to the classes of A, B, D. From the temporal evolution of the above BPs, we

obtain the intensity curves in 1600 and 1700 ˚A shown in Figure 7. The BPs appear

to have an oscillation of several minutes, just like the jets. This is probably due

to the recurrent reconnection modulated by the plasma motion and releases

energy quasi-periodically. This scenario has been supported by the theoretical

(Santos & B¨uchner 2007; Pariat et al. 2010) and observational (Madjarska et al.

2003; Ugarte-Urra et al. 2004; Doyle et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2011; Zhang et al.

2012; Guo et al. 2013; Samanta et al. 2015; Innes et al. 2016) work.

2.3. Observations by SDO/HMI

As the magnetic ﬁeld has intimate relation with the phenomenon happened in the

solar atmosphere, our study also included the analysis of the vector magnetic ﬁeld at the

photosphere as well as the extrapolated ﬁeld based on it. The vector magnetic ﬁeld is

provided by the HMI onboard SDO, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 arcsec per pixel and a

temporal resolution of 12 minutes. We present the images of the vertical component Bz

and the vector Bvec of the observed magnetic ﬁeld in Figure 8 (a, b, c), and display the

– 11 –

bottom layer of the extrapolated magnetic ﬁeld in Figure 8 (e). We see magnetic ﬁelds

with mixed polarities between the spots. These are the preferential places for a speciﬁc

bald patch topology structure (red points in Figure 8 (c – f)). This conception

dates back to Titov et al. (1993). The authors emphasized a place on the polarity

inversion line (PIL) at the photosphere where magnetic ﬁeld line threading through it

horizontally from negative to positive polarity, and named it as ’Bald Patch’. It relates

to a serpentine ﬁeld line when the ﬂux tube emerging from the convective region to the

solar atmosphere (Fan 2001a,b; Pariat et al. 2009). Similar structure has also been found

in the low altitude atmosphere and can be identiﬁed as ’magnetic dip’ refer to Pariat et al.

(2004). Cool and dense material often deposite in these dips. Such location as well as

its related BP separatrix has been found to be preferential place for reconnection when

proper surface ﬂows are involved. Such reconnection is responsible for the EBs

and brightening loops in many studies of observation and simulation (Pariat et al. 2009).

In the spectral observations, blueshift and redshift of spectral lines (such as Si IV,

C II, Mg II) associated with the bidirectional ﬂows are frequently recognized

around these places (Cheng et al. 2015). The comparison of the images of 2804.5 ˚A

overlaid by bald patches derived from observation and from extrapolation, shows a similar

distribution of the bald patches in the ﬁeld of view (Figure 8 (d, f)). It means that the

extrapolation correctly retrieves the magnetic ﬁeld structures.

The calculation of bald pathes or magnetic dips in 3D volume is based on the magnetic

ﬁeld in 3D. It is provided by the forced-ﬁeld extrapolation described in the next

section.

– 12 –

3. Forced-Field Extrapolation

To investigate the relationship of the BPs and loops with the associated magnetic ﬁeld,

we extrapolated the magnetic ﬁeld from Space-weather HMI Active Region Patch (SHARP)

Cylindrical Equal Area (CEA) data of SDO/HMI. The forced-ﬁeld extrapolation

code is described in Zhu et al. (2013) and computes the magnetic ﬁeld by

solving full MHD equations using a kind of relaxation method. The initial state

comprises a plane-parallel multilayered hydrostatic model (Fan 2001a), embedded with a

potential magnetic ﬁeld (Sakurai 1982) determined by the normal component of the vector

magnetogram. The outﬂow condition is applied for both sides and upper boundaries.

At the lower boundary the normal component of the magnetic ﬁeld is ﬁxed, while the

transverse ﬁeld is slowly changed from the initial condition to the observed ﬁeld. This is

called the ”stress and relax” approach (Roumeliotis 1996) which drives the system to evolve.

Finally, the Lorentz Force near the photosphere can be balanced by the pressure gradient

and plasma gravity, and the forced equilibrium of the entire region can be reached. Our

extrapolation is done on the initial size of the grid, e.g. 1 grid equal 0.5 arcsec, with a

domain of 328 × 248 × 160 grid.

Then we calculated the locations of bald patches referring to the equation in

Pariat et al. (2004):

Bz = 0 and B • ∇Bz > 0

(1)

the magnetic topologies of BPs A – L in detail are illustrated in Figure 9. In

our study, the BPs A, B and I are located above the magnetic PIL where magnetic

ﬂux cancelation is dominant, the BPs D, F, G, J have consistent locations with

their corresponding bald patches. However, we don’t see the consistency of the

locations between the BPs C, H, K, L and their corresponding bald patches.

The BP E is located over the PIL, without bald patch or cancelation topology. In our

– 13 –

later study, we ﬁnd that BPs C, E, H, K, L are at the footpoints of bald patch

related separatrix layers. The relevant bald patches are located far away from

the BPs.

The temporal evolution of the magnetic ﬂux of these BPs is shown in Figure

10. All these curves start from 11:09 UT and end at 12:09 UT. They cover the

time range of the AIA and IRIS observations indicated by the grey rectangular

region (11:46 UT to 12:04 UT) in each panel. The curves of BPs A, B and D,

F display a continuous decrease, while the curves of BPs I and G, J show a

temporary one during the observation (in the grey region). It manifests that

magnetic cancelation and reconnection, which are responsible for the plasma

heating, have happened either continuously or temporarily. Apparently, the

continuous cancelation or reconnection would produce stronger heating eﬀect

than the temporary one according to Table 1. The rest curves describe the local

condition of the magnetic ﬂux, and are meaningless for understanding the BPs

C, E, H, K, L that are related with separatrix layer footpoints. The diﬀerent

magnetic situation of the BPs is clearly shown in Figure 11.

Considering that the BPs A, B, D and I correspond to bombs 3, 4, 1 and 2 in

Peter et al. (2014) respectively, the bomb 1 (BP D) seems to be related with bald patch

reconnection while the other three bombs 2 (BP I), 3 (BP A), 4 (BP B) are produced

by ﬂux cancelation. In addition, Grubecka et al. (2016) studied the formation height of

the same BPs and listed their result in their Table 3. The altitude of hot spots A – E

ranges from 75 – 900 km from a 1D solar atmosphere model with the radiative transfer

code of Heinzel (1995). The formation height of A, B is relatively higher than D, which

could indicate that the cancelation reconnection happened a little higher than the BP

reconnection. It is surprising to detect that the ”hot explosions” (BPs A, B and I ) of

– 14 –

Peter et al. (2014) correspond principally to the ﬂux cancellation region rather than a

bald patch region like the bomb 1 (point D in our analysis). Their large emission values

indicate that reconnection by ﬂux cancellation lead to stronger heating than in bald patch

conﬁguration.

The extrapolated ﬁeld lines lying between the polarities and passing through the bald

patches which are labeled as red points are overplotted on the IRIS SJI 1400 ˚A in

Figure 12 and the upper panel of Figure 13. Figure 12 shows an overview of the

ﬁeld lines in this AR, while in Figure 13 we only selected several representatives for

clarity. These ﬁeld lines have diverse lengths but with a coherent direction going from

the positive to the negative polarities. Most of the brightening loops appearing in 1400

˚A have good correspondence with the magnetic ﬁeld lines in proﬁle. Hence, we suggest

that the brightening loops in the interface layer of this active region are at least partially

contributed by the reconnection along the bald patch separatrices.

We also extract these ﬁeld lines and exhibit their side views in the bottom panels of

Figure 13. The spatial distribution of the sea-serpent structures is prominent. Most of

these structures have relatively low altitude, while some higher ﬁeld lines have a height

of less than 3.5 Mm. The white points mark the locations of the bald patch that the ﬁeld

lines passing through. It manifests that the bald patch often connect two arcades, one is

lower and shorter and the other is higher and longer, just like the case from MHD model in

Aulanier et al. (1998).

4. Discussion and Conclusion

In this work, we have investigated an active region during its emerging phase. In this

phase, there are plenty of BPs that appear in between this region, i.e. in the moss, which

– 15 –

indicates that the atmosphere above has been heated. Hence, it is meaningful to study

the properties of the BPs for understanding the heating of the upper atmosphere under the

following two questions: 1) To what extent does the emerging ﬂux heat the atmosphere

above? and 2) At which location does the heating become more eﬀective?

This active region has been observed by the Multichannel Subtractive Double Pass

spectrograph (MSDP) in the Meudon Solar Tower on the ground and IRIS as well as SDO

in the space. These telescopes provide the images of this region from photosphere to the

corona, and also the spectra of the transition region which has already been analyzed by

Peter et al. (2014) and Grubecka et al. (2016). Here we selected IRIS SJI at 1400 ˚A and

spectrogram in Mg II h line wing at 2804.5 ˚A , AIA 1600 ˚A and 1700 ˚A to analyze the

atmosphere response to the emerging ﬂux. Our results demonstrate that the BPs that

appear in the IRIS SJI 1400 ˚A have their counterparts in other wavelengths (formed at

the minimum temperature) that we mentioned above, and most of them have similar

morphology. Referring to the formation temperatures of these spectral lines, we suggest

that the emerging ﬂux could heat the solar atmosphere from the upper photosphere to the

transition region.

We also investigate the temporal evolution of these BPs in AIA 1600 and 1700 ˚A. They

always exist during the period of around 20 minutes. However, the curve of intensity

evolution shows a periodic variation of several minutes, which could be probably due

to the periodic reconnection. According to the scanning time of the IRIS raster, we

determined the moments when the raster scanning through these BPs (labeled as white

rectangular boxes in Figure 5 and 6) and calculated the intensity ratio between AIA 1600

˚A and 1700 ˚A at these moments. The results suggest that some BPs, such as A to F, have

more contribution from C IV line, i.e. from higher temperature plasma while the others do

not.

– 16 –

As the heating only happens at particular sites, e.g. the BP sites, it means that the

energy release only occurs under special conditions. For understanding the non-uniform

heating eﬀect, we have studied the properties of these BPs in detail to see how they are

heated and why the heating eﬀects are diﬀerent. The magnetic conﬁguration and

the magnetic ﬂux evolution at the corresponding locations suggest that BPs

A, B and I are consistent with the magnetic cancelation scenario, BPs D, F,

G, J appear to have magnetic bald patch topology, and BPs C, E, H, K, L

are located at the footpoints of the bald patch related separatrix layers. The

magnetic ﬁeld separatrix layers are volume structures at where the magnetic

connectivity changes and current sheet can easily form (Low 1987). Considering

the contribution of the C IV line in diﬀerent BPs, our results indicate that

the bald patch reconnection may have weaker heating eﬀect than the magnetic

cancelation, and the continuous cancelation or reconnection may have stronger

heating eﬀect than the temporary one.

According to the simulation work of Ni et al. (2016), the level of the heating eﬀect

depends on the local plasma β, which is directly proportional with plasma density and

inversely proportional to magnetic ﬁeld strength. Their results show that low β magnetic

reconnection process is associated with high temperature events and high β with low

temperature events. In our situation, more materials would be deposited at the bald

patch locations than in cancelation regions. Supposing the magnetic ﬁeld under these two

conditions is of the same order, we suggest that our observational analyzes support the

theoretical results.

Besides the BP sites, energy release also happens at some bright arcade structures.

According to previous studies based on the LFFF or NLFFF extrapolations, or MHD

simulation, these structures are suspected to be related to the reconnection happened

– 17 –

at the serpentine ﬁeld lines that passing through the bald patches (Pariat et al. 2007;

Valori et al. 2012; Pariat et al. 2009). With our extrapolation result, we obtain the

corresponding serpentine ﬁeld lines and suggest that these lines have good accordance with

the bright arcades in between the emerging region. This fact conﬁrms the conclusions of

previous works from an observational aspect, that is when the new ﬂux emerges, it may

have some diﬃculty in passing through the photosphere and becomes horizontal at the

sub-surface as the pressure height changes. It can only continue the emergence until the

reconnection happens at its magnetic dips as well as its separatrix surface under suitable

photospheric ﬂows. The bright arcades visible in SJI 1400 ˚A indicate that probable

reconnection between the emerging ﬂux and the overlying magnetic ﬂux occurs

in current layers at QSLs, as suggested in the simulation work of Pariat et al.

(2009).

In summary, we have studied the BPs and transition region arcades in an emerging

ﬂux region. Using our forced-ﬁeld extrapolation, we ﬁnd observational evidence of magnetic

reconnection for these structures. This is the ﬁrst time for the extrapolation method, which

considering the physical condition in the lower atmosphere, to be used for investigating the

local heating events.
