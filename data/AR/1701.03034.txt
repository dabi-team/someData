ABSTRACT
Pulsars are magnetized rotating compact objects. They spin down due to magnetic dipole radiation
and wind emission. If photon has a nonzero mass, the spin down rate would be smaller than the zero
mass case. We show that an upper limit of the photon mass, i.e. mγ . h/P c2, may be placed if a
pulsar with period P is observed to spin down. Recently, a white dwarf (WD) — M dwarf binary,
AR Scorpii was discovered to emit pulsed broadband emission with pulses. The spin-down luminosity
of the WD can comfortably power the non-thermal radiation from the system. Applying our results
to the WD pulsar with P = 117 s, we obtain a stringent upper limit of the photon mass between
mγ < 6.3×10−50 g assuming a vacuum dipole spindown, and mγ < 9.6×10−50 g assuming a spindown
due to a fully developed pulsar wind.

1. INTRODUCTION

i.e.

Massive electrodynamics,

the electrodynamics
with non-zero photon mass, can be described by the
de Broglie-Proca theory (de Broglie 1922, 1923, 1940;
Proca 1936a,b,c,d, 1937, 1938), which is invariant for
the Lorentz-Poincar´e transformation. The photon-mass
bounds may be established by specifying the micro-
scopic origin of the mass (e.g. Adelberger et al. 2007;
Bonetti et al. 2017a), and experimentally one may di-
rectly constrain the zero-mass hypothesis for photon.
Since it is impossible to fully prove that the photon
rest mass is exactly zero via experiments, the only ex-
perimental strategy is to place ever tighter upper lim-
its on photon rest mass. Due to the uncertainty prin-
ciple, there is an ultimate upper limit of photon rest
mass (e.g. Goldhaber & Nieto 1971; Tu et al. 2005), i.e.,
mγ . ~/c2T ≃ 10−66 g, where T ≃ 1010 yr corresponds
to the age of the universe. Whereas such an upper limit
on a single particle is impossible to place, an ensemble
of particles might produce visible eﬀects at the classical
level.

From the theoretical point of view, the photon-mass
correction to Maxwell’s equations would cause changes
to the classical electromagnetic properties. One can
then constrain the photon mass through testing these
properties.
So far, the photon mass has been con-
strained via diﬀerent methods, which can be divided
into secure and speculative results (Goldhaber & Nieto
2010). The former includes the frequency dependence
of the speed of light (mγ < 1.5 × 10−47 g) (Lovell et al.
1964; Wu et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016; Wei et al. 2016;
Bonetti et al. 2016, 2017b; Shao & Zhang 2017), disper-
sion in the ionosphere (mγ < 10−46 g) (Kroll 1971),
Coulomb’s law (mγ < 2 × 10−47 g) (Williams et al.
1971), Jupiter’s magnetic ﬁeld (mγ < 7 × 10−49 g)
(Davis et al. 1975), and solar wind magnetic ﬁeld (mγ <
(2 − 3) × 10−51 g) (Ryutov 1997, 2007; Retin`o et al.
2016). The latter includes extended Lakes method

(mγ < 10−49 − 10−52 g) (Lakes 1998; Luo et al. 2003a,b;
Goldhaber & Nieto 2003), Higgs mass for photon (no
limit feasible) (Adelberger et al. 2007), cosmic magnetic
ﬁelds (mγ < 10−59 g) (Yamaguchi 1959; Chibisov 1976;
Adelberger et al. 2007), and so on.

If the photon has nonzero mass, the dispersion relation

would be

where

ω2 = c2k2 + µ2c2,

µ ≡ mγc/~,

(1)

(2)

and mγ is the photon mass (see Appendix). This is
the standard energy-momentum expression in the special
theory of relativity, which is similar to the plasma disper-
sion relation (with the plasma frequency ωp replaced by
µc). This dispersion relation means that photons with
diﬀerent energies have diﬀerent velocities. One impor-
tant requirement of the energy-momentum equation is
that the frequency of the free electromagnetic wave must
satisfy ω > µc, or ~ω > mγc2. Therefore, one direct
way to constrain the photon mass is to detect the elec-
tromagnetic wave at extremely low frequencies so that
mγ < hν/c2 ≃ 7 × 10−47 g (ν/10 Hz), e.g. the Schu-
mann resonances at ν ∼ 8 Hz (see Schumann 1952;
Balser & Wagner 1960; Jackson 1962). At even lower
frequencies (e.g. . 1 Hz), the detection of the electro-
magnetic waves is very diﬃcult. One possible method to
study massive electrodynamics is through studying the
modiﬁcation of the radiation mechanisms at such low
frequencies. We note that for the magnetic dipole radia-
tion, the angular frequency of the electromagnetic wave
is equal to the angular frequency of rotation, i.e. ω ∼ Ω.
One natural question arises: what happens if Ω < µc for
a magnetic dipole?

In this paper, we propose a new method to obtain a
limit of the photon mass by applying the spin down in-
formation of pulsars. Since the Gauss units have been
adopted in the literature to study pulsar spin down dy-
namics, we stick to this unit system throughout the pa-

2. PULSAR SPIN DOWN WITH NONZERO PHOTON MASS
Traditional pulsars are rapidly spinning magnetized
neutron stars. White dwarf pulsars have been theoretical
expected and recently proven to exist (e.g. Zhang & Gil
2005; Marsh et al. 2016; Geng et al. 2016). The rota-
tional kinetic energy luminosity of a pulsar is given by
˙E = (2/5)M R2Ω ˙Ω, where M is the pulsar mass, R is
the pulsar radius, and Ω is the angle velocity. Obser-
vations show that ˙Ω < 0 in general, i.e. pulsars spin
down. Since gravitational wave spindown is negligible
for slow-rotators such as radio pulsars, magnetars, and
WD pulsars, pulsar spindown is naturally attributed to
electromagnetic torques (due to magnetic dipole radia-
tion or a wind power).

2.1. Vacuum case: Magnetic dipole radiation
The simplest model for pulsar spindown is magnetic
dipole radiation. For mγ = 0, the energy losses of the
vacuum magnetic dipole radiation energy is given by L =
pR6Ω4 sin2 θ/6c3, where Bp is the polar magnetic ﬁeld,
B2
and θ is the angle between the magnetic and rotational
axes. The radiation energy originates from the rotational
kinetic energy of the pulsar, causing the spindown of the
pulsar.

We calculate the magnetic dipole radiation with mγ 6=
0. Following Crandall & Wheeler (1984) (see Appendix),
we obtain the radiation power of the magnetic dipole ﬁeld
in vacuum, i.e.

Lm =

for Ω > µc, and Lm = 0 for Ω 6 µc. Here m is
the magnetic dipole moment. For µ = 0, the magnetic
dipole radiation power reduces to the classical result, i.e.,
Lm,0 = (1/3)m2Ω4/c3. We deﬁne

(4)

for Ω > µc, and η = 0 for Ω 6 µc. η characterizes the
correction of non-zero photon mass eﬀect. The η − mγ
relation for the vacuum case is presented in Figure 1. In
general, the observed period of the pulsar is very accu-
rate with error ≪ 1 s. Even for the WD pulsar in AR
Scorpii, the relative uncertainty is of the order ∼ 1%.
The main uncertainty of the photon mass limit is from
that of η. Observationally, quantifying η needs to inde-
pendently measure Lm and Lm,0. Since pulsar spindown
is naturally attributed to the magnetic dipole radiation
in the vacuum case, one has Lm ≃ ˙E = (2/5)M R2Ω ˙Ω,
which may be derived from pulsar mass M , radius R,
and spin parameters Ω and ˙Ω. On the other hand, the
magnetic dipole radiation without photon mass is given
by Lm,0 ≃ Ω4R6B2
p/6c3 (Here, we have adopted θ = π/2.
For the case with θ 6= π/2, the constraint on the photon
mass would be better), which requires an independent
measurement of the polar cap magnetic ﬁeld at surface,
Bp. This ﬁeld may be measured or constrained via other

methods such as MHD pumping, Zeeman splitting1, cy-
clotron lines, and properties of magnetar bursts. Finally,
one has

(5)

Once η is derived from M , R, Bp, Ω and ˙Ω according to
Eq.(5), one can put it in Eq.(4) to calculate the photon
mass.

However, there is an immediate, most conservative up-
per limit of photon that can be readily derived. Accord-
ing to Eq.(3) and Eq.(4), as long as η > 0 is satisﬁed,
which is true as long as a pulsar is observed to spin down,
one should have µ < Ω/c. A robust photon mass upper
limit can be set to mγ,crit, i.e.

mγ < mγ,crit ≡ h/P c2,

(6)

which is shown as the a sharp cut oﬀ of η in Figure
1. Equation (6) is essentially the result of the standard
energy-momentum relation and does not depend on the
detailed pulsar parameters other than the spin period P .
More generally, if η can be constrained from Eq.(5),
one can give a more stringent limit than that of Eq.(6).
In Table 1, we list the results of mγ upper limits for the
most conservative one (η > 0) and three other assumed
lower limit values, i.e. 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9. One can see
that the improvement from the most conservative value
even from η & 0.9 is not signiﬁcant. As a result, for the
vacuum case one does not need to measure Bp to derive
a robust constraint. As long as the pulsar is observed
to spin down, i.e. η > 0, a conservative limit of mγ <
mγ,crit can be placed.

sar with a longer period would give a more strin-

radio pulsars,
the one with the longest period is PSR J2144-3933
˙P = 0.475 ×
(Young et al. 1999) with P = 8.51 s,
10−15 s s−1, and spin-down luminosity ˙E = 3.2 ×

. For magnetars, the one
with the longest period is 1ES 1841-045 (Dib et al. 2008)

˙P = 3.93×10−11 s s−1, and ˙E = 0.95×

(Wickramasinghe & Ferrario 2000)
magnetized WDs
(cid:1)
with B ∼ 106 − 109 G have periods around one hour
(Ferrario et al. 1997). However, no spindown measure-
ments have been reported. The WD — M dwarf bi-
nary system, AR Scorpii, was recently reported to emit
pulsed broadband emission (Marsh et al. 2016). The
WD pulsar in AR Scorpii has a measured spindown
˙P = 3.9 × 10−13 s s−1, and
parameters P = 117 s,
˙E = 1.5 × 1033 erg s−1. The mean luminosity of AR
Scorpii is 1.7 × 1032 erg s−1, which includes the thermal
emission of 4.4 × 1031 erg s−1 from the stellar compo-
nents. Therefore, the non-thermal emission from AR

ee3c/~3 =
2.4 × 109 G,, the Coulomb potential is treated as a perturba-
tion to the magnetic interaction, leading to a correction of atomic
spectral lines (e.g. Lai 2015). For neutron-star pulsars with B ≫
109 G, such a correction should be considered when studying Zee-
man splitting. However, for magnetized white-dwarf pulsars with
B ∼ (106 − 109) G, this strong ﬁeld correction could be neglected.

Scorpii could be comfortably powered by the magnetic
dipole radiation of the white dwarf (Marsh et al. 2016;
Geng et al. 2016). Such a long period white dwarf pulsar
can provide a stringent constraint on the photon mass.
In Figure 1, the blue, red and green lines denote the
periods of PSR J2144-3933, 1ES 1841-045 and the WD
pulsar in AR Scorpii, respectively. The respective con-
strained upper limits of the photon mass are shown in
Table 1: for PSR J2144-3933, one has mγ < 8.6×10−49 g;
for 1ES 1841-045, one has mγ < 6.2 × 10−49 g; and for

respectively.

2.2. Nonvacuum case: Pulsar wind
If the magnetic axis is parallel to the rotation axis,
the magnetic dipole radiation is zero in vacuum. How-
ever, active pulsars are believed to be surrounded by
a magnetosphere,
from which a continuously outﬂow
is launched from the open ﬁeld line regions as a pul-
sar wind (Goldreich & Julian 1969). The outﬂowing
plasma exerts an electromagnetic torque on the pulsar,
so that the pulsar would spin down due to the existence
of a pulsar wind (Harding et al. 1999; Xu & Qiao 2001;
Contopoulos & Spitkovsky 2006; Tong et al. 2013).

To quantify the eﬀect of non-zero photon mass on
the wind spindown rate, we ﬁrst calculate the magnetic
dipole ﬁeld with mγ 6= 0. We consider a statistic ﬁeld
solution (see Appendix): (∇2 − µ2)A = −4πJ/c. The
corresponding solution is (Jackson 1962)

The ﬁeld-line equation dr/Br = rdθ/Bθ can be written
as dr/dθ = 2r(1+µr) cot θ/(1+µr +µ2r2). Interestingly,
for µ → ∞, one has dr/dθ ≃ 2 cot θ/µ → 0 for θ ≫ 0,
which means that the magnetosphere would approach a
3-dimensional sphere, as shown in Figure 2. Integrating
the ﬁeld-line equation, one obtains L sin2 θ = reµr/(1 +
µr). Thus, the open ﬁeld line angle at the pulsar surface
becomes sin θc = ξ (R/RLC)1/2 where

χ = 1/3 (see Appendix). Equation (14), even through
not an explicit expression of mγ, can be used to de-
rive mγ upper limit when a lower limit of η is given
(mγ = 0 when η = 1). The η − mγ relation for non-
vacuum wind spindown case is presented in Figure 4.
Similar to the vacuum case, the wind spin down power
rapidly fall oﬀ beyond a certain mγ given a measured P .
The diﬀerence from the vacuum case is that there is no
absolute cutoﬀ at mγ,crit = h/P c2. In order to obtain

Scorpii as examples. We again assume η > 0.1, 0.5, 0.9.
The upper limits of the photon mass using diﬀerent
sources are shown in Table 1.
In particular, the WD
pulsar in AR Scorpii (Marsh et al. 2016) has P = 117 s,

WD pulsar in AR Scorpii, respectively.

Next, we calculate the plasma density in the magne-
tosphere. Since photon mass does not aﬀect the Lorentz
force density of the matter (Goldhaber & Nieto 1971),
the Ohm’s law is still J = σ (E + υ × B/c). For astro-
physical force-free plasmas, due to σ → ∞ and υ = Ω×r,
one has E = −Ω × r × B/c (Goldreich & Julian 1969;
Ryutov 1997, 2007). Therefore, the charge density is
given by ρ = (∇ · E + µ2φ)/4π = −Ω · B/2πc + µ2φ/4π
(see Appendix). On the other hand, according to the
statistic ﬁeld equation: ρ = (−∇2 + µ2)φ/4π, one has
∇2φ = −4πρGJ, where ρGJ ≡ −Ω · B/2πc is the classi-
cal Goldreich-Julian density (Goldreich & Julian 1969).
The new plasma charge density ρ with mγ 6= 0 is then
given by

∇2 (ρ − ρGJ) + µ2ρGJ = 0.

For a neutron star (white dwarf),
3.5 × 10−44 g (6.4 × 10−47 g) (established with exist-

magnetic ﬁeld strength and the charge density at the
pole are Bp ≃ 2m/R3 and ρ ≃ ρGJ, respectively, which
are consistent with the case of mγ = 0. The radius
of the polar cap is rp = ξR (ΩR/c)1/2. The potential

˙P = 3.9 × 10−13 s s−1 and ˙E = 1.5 × 1033 erg s−1.
An independent constraint on the white dwarf surface
magnetic ﬁeld strength was set via the “MHD pump-
ing” of the secondary star (M-dwarf) in the binary sys-
tem (Buckley et al. 2016). The magnetic ﬁeld of the
WD would penetrate and dissipate in the M-dwarf atmo-
sphere and give rise to additional optical emission. The
dissipation power of magnetic energy at the M-dwarf can
be estimated from2 PMHD = (B2
2δ)(2π/Pb),
where R2 ≃ 2.5 × 1010 cm is the radius of the M dwarf
star, Pb ≃ 118 s is the beat period, δ = (ηturPb/π)1/2 ≃
2 × 108η1/2
tur,15 cm is the dissipation depth of magnetic en-
ergy for the photospheric conditions of a M-type dwarf,
and ηtur = (1015 cm2 s−1)ηtur,15 is the turbulent diﬀu-
sivity (Buckley et al. 2016).
If a fraction of the mean
optical luminosity of AR Sco in excess of the combined
stellar contributions is from MHD pumping, i.e., PMHD ≃
ζL+ = 1.3 × 1032ζ erg s−1, where ζ is the fraction of
MHD pumping contribution, the magnetic ﬁeld strength
at the secondary star would be B2 ≃ 204ζ1/2η−1/4
tur,15 G.
For mγ ≪ ~/Rc ≃ 6.4 × 10−47 g (established with ex-
isting photon mass limits), the magnetic dipole ﬁeld of
the white dwarf would satisfy B ∝ r−3. The magnetic
ﬁeld strength at the pole of the WD would be then de-
rived as Bp ≃ B2(a/R)3 ≃ 6.4 × 108ζ1/2η−1/4

where a ≃ 8 × 1010M 1/3

(0.8M⊙)M0.8 is the white dwarf mass. According to the
Hamada-Salpeter relation, the radius-mass relation of
white dwarfs satisﬁes R ≃ 5.5×108M −0.8
cm. The dipole
radiation luminosity with zero-mass photon is Lw,0 ≃
0.8 erg s−1. The
Ω4R6B2
dipole radiation luminosity with nonzero-mass photon is
Lw ≃ ˙E = (2/5)M R2Ω ˙Ω ≃ 1.9 × 1033M −0.6
erg s−1.
One therefore has η ≃ 3.3ζ−1η1/2
0.8 . Here the tur-
bulent diﬀusivity is taken as ηtur ≃ (1014 − 1015) cm2s−1
(e.g. Meintjes & Jurua 2006; Buckley et al. 2016) and
the white dwarf mass is taken as M ≃ (0.8 − 1.3)M⊙
(Marsh et al. 2016). Since ζ < 1, one can derive η > 0.3,
which is the most conservative constraint based on the
uncertainties of all observed quantities. As a result, for
the non-vacuum wind spindown case we obtain

3. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
We proposed a method of using pulsar (including neu-
tron stars and white dwarfs) spin-down observations to
set a stringent upper limit on the photon mass. In partic-
ular, for the recently observed WD pulsar in AR Scorpii,
we obtained a stringent constraint on the photon mass
mγ . several × 10−50 g. For vacuum spindown case, the
fact that the WD spin downs places a robust lower limit
mγ < mγ,crit = h/P c2 = 6.3 × 10−50g. For the non-
vacuum fully developed wind spindown case, based on
the constraint of surface magnetic ﬁeld of the WD using
MHD pumping modeling (Buckley et al. 2016), one can
derive mγ < 9.6 × 10−50g. In reality, the spin down be-
havior of the WD pulsar may be explained in the param-
eter regime between these two extreme models. These
two derived photon mass limits can be therefore taken
the bracket the true photon mass upper limit derived
from the WD pulsar.

(Wickramasinghe & Ferrario 2000; Zhang & Gil 2005)
with B ∼ 106 − 109 G have periods up to one hour
and longer (Ferrario et al. 1997), we strongly urge
further observations to these objects to detect their
spindown behavior ( ˙P ) and to measure their magnetic
ﬁeld strength independently. These observations would
give an upper limit around mγ . 10−51 g, which would
be the most stringent limit within the secure methods.

mγ < 9.6 × 10−50 g.

2 In principle, the correction to magnetic energy density due
to non-zero photon mass should be included. However, given the
already established stringent photon mass upper limit in the liter-
ature, this correction is negligibly small.

In our analysis, we have assumed that the magnetic
ﬁeld of the pulsar is dipolar. This is justiﬁed in large
scale for NS and WD pulsars. Near the magnetic poles
of the pulsars, multipole magnetic components may ex-
ist. For the vacuum case, even if the magnetic ﬁeld is
multipole, the robust limit mγ < mγ,crit ≡ h/P c2 is
still valid, since it is rooted from the standard energy-
momentum relation. For the non-vacuum case, the accu-
rate calculation of the spindown power of the multipole
ﬁeld is complicated. However, due to the contribution of
the photon mass, the term of e−µr still appears in the
ﬁeld equation, so that the enclosed magnetic ﬂux of the
open ﬁeld line would contains a factor of e−µRLC (see Ap-
pendix). Therefore, the spindown power of the multipole
ﬁeld would also be suppressed when Ω < µc. As a result,

our derivations based on the dipole assumption would be
still valid to order of magnitude.

MAXWELL EQUATIONS WITH NONZERO PHOTON MASS

APPENDIX

The classical Maxwell equations and the corresponding Lagrangian are based on the hypothesis that the photon
mass is zero. If photon has a non-zero mass, one can modify the Lagrangian density by adding a “mass” term. Such
a Lagrangian is known as the de Broglie-Proca Lagrangian (Proca 1936d; de Broglie 1940), which is given by

(A1)

where Aα = (φ, A) is the gauge potential, Jα = (ρc, J) is the external current sources, the ﬁeld F αβ is given by
F αβ = ∂αAβ − ∂βAα, and µ ≡ mγc/~, where mγ is the photon mass. The de Broglie-Proca equation reads

In Lorenz gauge, according to current conservation, the above equation can be written as

∂βFβα + µ2Aα =

(A3)

Each component of Aα satisﬁes the Klein-Gordon equation with source, where (cid:3) ≡ ∂2/c2∂t2 −∇2. The massive photon
version of Maxwell’s equations is given by the de Broglie-Proca equations in three dimensions (de Broglie 1940), i.e.

Next, we consider the radiation of massive photons with a certain frequency. We assume that a point source of

strength f (t) resides at the origin. The spherical wave ϕ(r, t) caused by such a source is given by

For an outgoing wave with f (t) as a function of exp(iωt), one has (Crandall & Wheeler 1984)

((cid:3) + µ2)ϕ(r, t) = δ(r)f (t).

which means that the wave is dispersed and the anomaly at ω = µc is representative. Since massive photons with
diﬀerent energies have diﬀerent velocities, one can use extragalactic sources to constrain the photon mass (Lovell et al.
1964; Wu et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016; Wei et al. 2016; Bonetti et al. 2016, 2017b; Shao & Zhang 2017). Due to the
signiﬁcant dispersion of the electromagnetic wave at very low frequencies, stringent constraints on the photon mass
may be achieved by experiments at very low frequencies, e.g. the nano satellite concept (Bentum et al. 2017).

MAGNETIC DIPOLE RADIATION WITH NONZERO PHOTON MASS

Following Crandall & Wheeler (1984), we assume that the electric dipole moment is p.

In the long-wave-length

limit, the vector potential is given by the integral of solutions Eq.(A7), i.e.

A(r, θ) =

iωp
cr

exp[i(ωt − kr)],

where k = (ω2/c2 − µ2)1/2 is the dispersion relation. The magnetic and electric ﬁelds are given by

B = ∇ × A =

(n × p) exp[i(ωt − kr)],

E = −

(∇ × B + µ2A) =

where n is the unit vector from the origin to (r, θ). The Poynting vector can be written as

P =

Re(E × B∗

).

The time-averaged power radiated per unit solid angle by the oscillating dipole moment p is

Re(r2n · P ) =

vacuum as

PULSAR SPIN DOWN POWER

Here, we calculate the pulsar spindown luminosity using the method of Contopoulos et al. (1999). At ﬁrst, we deﬁne

the enclosed magnetic ﬂux of the open ﬁeld line region as

ψopen ≡

B · dS =

RLC

Bθrdr

(C1)
where ψdipole = BpR3/2RLC is the magnetic ﬂux of the open ﬁeld line in the standard magneto-static dipole model.
The last equality is derived from Eq.(10). We assume that the ﬂux distribution along the open ﬁeld lines is close to
the Michel split-monopole solution (Michel 1974), e.g.,

= ψdipole(µRLC + 1)e−µRLC,

I(ψ) ≃ IMichel = ψ

Due to magnetospheric rotation, the electric current circuits are generated at the pulsar poles, forming electromagnetic
torques anti-parallel to the angular momentum of the pulsar, e.g., T = rBJdSdr/c, where dS denotes any stellar cross
section, and J denotes the poloidal electric current density J. Finally, the stellar rotation energy loss through the
electromagnetic torques is given by (Contopoulos 2005)
