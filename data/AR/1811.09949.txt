We derive an effective Hamiltonian system describing the low energy dynamics of circular magnetic
skyrmions and antiskyrmions. Using scaling and symmetry arguments we model (anti-)skyrmion dynamics
through a ﬁnite set of coupled, canonically conjugated, collective coordinates. The resulting theoretical descrip-
tion is independent of both micromagnetic details as well as any speciﬁcity in the ansatz of the skyrmion proﬁle.
Based on the Hamiltonian structure we derive a general description for breathing dynamics of (anti-)skyrmions
in the limit of radius much larger than the domain wall width. The effective energy landscape reveals two qual-
itatively different types of breathing behavior. For small energy perturbations we reproduce the well-known
small breathing mode excitations, where the magnetic moments of the skyrmion oscillate around their equi-
librium solution. At higher energies we ﬁnd a breathing behavior where the in-plane angle of the skyrmion
continuously precesses, transforming N´eel to Bloch skyrmions and vice versa. For a damped system we observe
the transition from the continuously rotating and breathing skyrmion into the oscillatory one. We analyze the
characteristic frequencies of both breathing types, as well as their amplitudes and distinct energy dissipation
rates. For rotational (oscillatory) breathing modes we predict on average a linear (exponential) decay in energy.
We argue that this stark difference in dissipative behavior should be observable in the frequency spectrum of
excited (anti-)skyrmions.

INTRODUCTION

Topological magnetic textures have attracted substantial at-
tention in spintronics1–4 in light of prospects to harness their
favorable properties for magnetic memory technologies,5–7
information processing8–12 and novel approaches to compu-
tation.13–19 An important building block in this direction is
understanding their dynamical excitations in order to test
stability and to devise ways to efﬁciently manipulate them.
Among the magnetic textures studied are domain walls5,20–22
and skyrmions.4,6,23–27 With respect to possible applications in
memory devices, skyrmions present several advantages over
domain walls due to their smaller sizes, lower threshold for
current driven mobility,3,7,26,28 and their tendency to avoid ob-
stacles and boundaries.29 Recently, a growing collection of
other exotic relatives are also receiving attention. This in-
cludes magnetic solitons of higher topological order,30 chiral
bobbers,31 non-topological counterparts such as the skyrmio-
nium particle,32 and antiskyrmions33–36 where the winding
number is opposite in sign compared to the skyrmion.

Following the pioneering work by Schryer and Walker,37
effective descriptions for current-driven and ﬁeld-driven do-
main wall motion have been considered widely,20,38,39 includ-
ing recent models leveraging canonically conjugated variables
derived from the spin Berry phase action.40–42 For a magnetic
skyrmion, it has been shown32,43,44 that its motion can be de-
scribed with two conjugated variables describing its position.
Effective descriptions for the internal dynamics of magnetic
skyrmions, however, are few in number. Previous works have
often focused on eigenmode analysis of magnons to obtain
the small amplitude internal excitations of isolated magnetic
skyrmions.45–48 Skyrmion breathing modes, in which the core

of the spin structure grows and shrinks periodically in time,
were ﬁrst described theoretically by numerical simulations of
skyrmion lattices49 and later found experimentally50 in the in-
sulator Cu2OSeO3 from microwave response experiments.

In this work, we derive a non-linear effective model for
rotationally symmetric (anti-)skyrmion breathing modes in
terms of two collective coordinates whose validity extends be-
yond approaches based on an eigenmode analysis, similar to
an earlier effective breathing model found in the context of
dynamically stabilized skyrmions.51 The novelty of this work
lies in the proposal of a Hamiltonian formalism that is inde-
pendent of microscopic details, applicable to the circular in-
ternal modes of both skyrmions and antiskyrmions. We con-
sider an experimentally relevant model for chiral thin ﬁlms
to study the equilibrium and breathing properties of (anti-)
skyrmions in detail and we show that all material details can

the non-linear excitations above equilibrium, we describe two
dynamical regimes of coherent magnetization behavior: (i)
oscillation around the local equilibrium magnetization direc-
tion, and (ii) rotational breathing mode dynamics where the
local magnetization continuously rotates. By analogy, these
regimes may be thought of as a pendulum which, depending
on its energy, either (i) swings about its equilibrium position
or (ii) fully rotates around its pivot point.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe
how to pass from a micromagnetic dynamical description to
a Hamiltonian mechanics in terms of collective coordinates.
In Sec. III we derive the Hamiltonian mechanics describing
the dynamics of soft modes for (anti-)skyrmions. We ﬁrst re-
view the Poisson bracket for the translational motion of rigid
textures in two dimensions and then derive its analog for cir-
cular breathing modes. In Sec. IV we introduce a micromag-

 
 
 
 
 
 
netic model for chiral thin ﬁlms with perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy, construct its effective energy as a one parameter
physical model and study its equilibrium properties. Lastly,
in Sec. V, as an application of the effective Hamiltonian for-
malism, we study the breathing modes of circularly shaped
(anti-)skyrmions and make precise predictions regarding their
dissipative behavior.

II. COLLECTIVE COORDINATES AND HAMILTONIAN
FORMALISM

The magnetization dynamics below the critical temperature
in ferromagnetic materials is well described in a continuum
approximation by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equa-
tion,52

where the magnetization conﬁguration is represented by the
unit vector m(r, t) = M (r, t)/Ms. Here J = Ms/γ0 is
the angular momentum density, γ0 is the gyromagnetic con-
stant, Ms is the constant saturation magnetization, the Hamil-
tonian of the system is H ≡ H[m], α is the Gilbert damp-
ing parameter, and the overdots indicate total time derivatives
˙m ≡ dm/dt.

The LLG is a non-linear differential equation with an in-
ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. This poses an obstacle
for the comprehensive study of the magnetization dynamics,
prohibiting a full analytical solution and usually requiring ex-
tensive micromagnetic simulations. However, the low energy
dynamics of magnetic textures depend only on the system’s
soft modes which can be described by conjugated variables
in a Hamiltonian formalism.39,41,42,53 This allows access to
generic features of the magnetization textures independently
from the microscopic characteristics of the material.

The conservative, precessional, part of the LLG equation

may be derived from the ﬁrst variation of the action

Berry phase action.40,43,54 The spin Berry phase couples
the dynamical degrees of freedom of the local magnetiza-
tion. In a pherical representation of the magnetization ﬁeld,
m(θ(r, t), φ(r, t)) = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ)(cid:124), using
the “north-pole” parametrization,55 it is possible to write the
spin Berry phase as,

Since the magnetization is characterized by a ﬁeld, it has
inﬁnitely many modes.
It is possible to map the dynamics
to an inﬁnite number of time dependent functions ξ(t) =
{ξ1(t), ξ2(t), . . . }, i.e. m[r, ξ(t)]. The unique equation of
motion with inﬁnite degrees of freedom, Eq. (1), becomes an
inﬁnite set of equations of motion for these dynamical param-
eters in this approach. The utility of this mapping is that these
different parameters may have different time scales. Therefore
the low energy excitations can be described as a reduced set
of collective coordinates, ξ(t) = {ξ1(t), ξ2(t), . . . , ξ2N (t)}
describing the soft modes which dominate the dynamics,39
and whose relaxation time is much longer than the rest of the
inﬁnite set. Examples include the position and tilt angle of
a domain wall when subjected to small driving currents, or
the position (X, Y )(cid:124) of a rigid homogenous domain in steady
translational motion as described originally by Thiele.56 Iden-
tifying collective coordinates therefore offers the possibility
to work with a reduced number of degrees of freedom, i.e.
a minimal number of equations of motion just for the corre-
sponding soft modes, rather than the full LLG ﬁeld equation,
which is usually analytically intractable.

There are several methods to obtain the equations of motion
for the collective coordinates.39,41,56,57 In this paper we outline
the Hamiltonian approach. Within this formalism, the equa-
tions of motion are obtained in an explicit and direct manner
from an effective energy which is a function of collective co-
ordinates for the soft modes. We provide the comparison be-
tween this Hamiltonian approach and the generalized Thiele
approach in Appendix B. Recasting Eq. (1) in a Hamiltonian
language yields43

˙m = {m, H}Φ,Π + γm,

(6)

containing an energy conserving part expressed using Pois-
son brackets for two canonically conjugated ﬁelds Φ(r, t)
and Π(r, t), and a damping contribution described by γm ≡
αm× ˙m. The conventions for Poisson brackets used through-
out this paper and their properties are listed in Appendix A.

The effective equations of motion for the collective coordi-

nates in the Hamiltonian language are

˙ξi = {ξi, H}q,p + γξi,

(7)

Two canonically conjugated ﬁelds, in this case given by
φ(r, t) and J [1 − cos(θ(r, t))], are sufﬁcient to describe the
magnetization dynamics. In addition to the energy conserv-
ing part, the phenomenological damping term may be intro-
duced directly into the Euler-Lagrange equations by use of a

where the Poisson brackets {·, ·}q,p are now deﬁned for pairs
of canonical variables (qi, pi) in terms of the independent col-
lective coordinates ξi(t) and their time derivatives ˙ξi(t).

In general, the canonical coordinates may always be taken
as collective coordinates themselves, qi ≡ ξi; meanwhile, the

i Ai

momenta are gauge-dependent functionals pi = Ai[ξ] so that
the corresponding Lagrangian is L = (cid:80)
˙ξi − H.58 The
canonical momenta arising from the vector potential corre-
spond to a monopole ﬁeld in the spin Berry phase action, i.e.
∇ × A = J m,53,59 and are related to the gyrotropic tensor
by39,53 Gij = J −1(∂Ai/∂ξj − ∂Aj/∂ξi). For the commonly-
used gauge choice giving Eq. (3) the functional is simply
Ai[ξ] = (cid:82) dV (1 − cos θ)∂ξiφ. In terms of the magnetization,
the gyrotropic tensor is

(cid:90)

Gij =

dV m · (cid:0)∂ξim × ∂ξj m(cid:1) .

An important example of magnetic solitons in 2D are
skyrmions. In the following we will apply the Hamiltonian
description given by Eqs. (7) and (10) to the dynamics of
skyrmions and antiskyrmions. First we review the steady
translational motion for rigid topological structures using this
approach, and second we apply the technique to study the
breathing mode.

A. Translational modes of rigid topological textures

In the following, we will only consider Hamiltonians H =
H[ξ] that are not explicitly time dependent. In this case the
dissipative part γξi is derived by comparing the rate of energy

We point out that equations (7) and (10) taken together
are not speciﬁc to magnetization dynamics; rather, they are
generic for conservative mechanical systems to which fric-

in the equation of motion by the use of a Rayleigh func-
tion. Using the identity {ξi, H}ξ,pξ = (cid:80)

III. EFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN DESCRIPTIONS FOR
MAGNETIC SKYRMIONS

The LLG equation contains topologically non-trivial solu-
tions. In 1D they include domain walls, and in 2D they in-
clude different types of solitons that are distinguished by their
integer topological charge or winding number,

The translational motion of a rigid structure can be de-
scribed in terms of a position rs(t) = (X(t), Y (t))(cid:124) where X
and Y are collective coordinates describing a soft mode.43,59,60
The following discussion does not require a speciﬁc deﬁni-
tion of rs(t). To obtain the Poisson bracket structure from
Eq. (3), we need to peturbatively expand the ﬁelds θ(r, t) and
∂tφ(r, t) in terms of small deviations in X,Y and ˙X, ˙Y re-
spectively. Considering a rigid texture ansatz for the magneti-
zation, m(r, t) = m0(r − rs(t)), implies56 ∂X m = −∂xm
and ∂Y m = −∂ym. Performing an expansion in the spin
Berry Phase action (3) up to quadratic order and discarding
terms that do not contribute to the dynamics leads to, (see Ap-
pendix B)

where z0 is the thickness of the system and the spatial integral

(13)

For a study of the internal dynamics of magnetic solitons,
such as skyrmion breathing modes, one must go beyond the

4

skyrmions, the phase η is the global in-plane angle of the local
magnetization pointing away from the radial direction (such
that η = 0, π correspond to N´eel and η = ±π/2 to Bloch
conﬁgurations respectively), while for antiskyrmions, chang-
ing η corresponds to a rigid rotation of the entire magnetic
texture.

We will now follow the general recipe of Sec. II. By esti-
mating the volume integral for the Berry phase term in Eq. (3)
we obtain the effective action

(cid:90)

Seff =

dt (cid:0)aJ R2 ˙η − H(cid:1) ,

(20)

in terms of the softmodes R and η. The length scale a is given
by a = 2πz0C, where C is a dimensionless constant (with
0 < C < 2) arising from the integral over ρ. Deﬁning the
canonical momentum conjugate to η as pη = aJ R2, we read
off the Poisson bracket as

{η, R2}η,pη =

rigid texture (or traveling-wave) approximation used in the
last section. We will consider a thin ﬁlm system that is transla-
tionally invariant along the z direction and contains localized
rotationally symmetric states,6,23,24

Via the identity: {η, R2}η,pη = (∂RR2){η, R}η,pη =
2R{η, R}η,pη we obtain {η, R}η,pη = (2aJ R)−1. Exploit-
ing Eq. (11), the dynamical equations for η and R are readily
derived

m(ρ) = (sin θ(ρ) cos φ(ψ), sin θ(ρ) sin φ(ψ), cos θ(ρ))

(cid:124)

,
(18a)

ρ = (ρ cos ψ, ρ sin ψ)(cid:124),

(18b)

where ρ and ψ are the polar coordinates in the x–y plane.
Since the magnetic angle θ only changes with distance ρ from
the skyrmion core, these ﬁeld conﬁgurations are referred to
as circular in this work. In view of describing the breathing
modes of skyrmions as well as antiskyrmions we parameterize
the azimuthal angle of the magnetization by,

φ(ψ) = mψ + η,

(19)

where m ∈ Z is the vorticity and η is the relative azimuthal
angle. For a simple skyrmion one has m = 1 and the angle η
describes its helicity: for a Bloch-skyrmion η = (n + 1/2)π
and for a N´eel-skyrmion η = nπ where n ∈ Z, see Fig. 1.
This corresponds to Q = −m/2 [cos θ(∞) − cos θ(0)] with
the boundary conditions θ(0) = π and θ(∞) = 0. In other
words the ferromagnetic background points in the +ˆz direc-
tion. For circular (anti-)skyrmions there are two characteristic
the radius R and the width d for the twisted
length scales:
domain over which mz varies, see Fig. 1(c). We deﬁne the ra-
dius R by the circle where mz = 0. We assume in the follow-
ing that during the breathing dynamics θ(ρ) retains its smooth
and monotonic variation, ensuring the deﬁnition of R to be
unique. This work will consider only large (anti-)skyrmions
in the regime where d (cid:28) R where the skyrmion’s wall width
can be considered constant even as its radius is allowed to
vary.

Above we used that ∂Rm · ∂ηm = 0 by virtue of the rotation-

the effective internal dynamics of a rotationally symmetric
magnetic texture subject to the ansatz Eqs. (18) and (19) for
time-independent Hamiltonians H.

IV. EFFECTIVE ENERGY FOR CIRCULAR SKYRMIONS

Previous works have assumed an explicit domain wall
ansatz for the skyrmion’s radial proﬁle.62–64 By using scaling
arguments, however, one does not need to assume a speciﬁc
ansatz for the skyrmion. The energy can in fact be expanded
in powers of the collective R coordinate for skyrmions sat-
isfying d (cid:28) R. We illustrate this procedure for a micro-
magnetic model including exchange, anisotropy and interfa-
cial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), whose mag-
netic free energy is given by
(cid:90)

The relevant soft mode for the breathing dynamics of a cir-
cular (anti-)skyrmion is described by the radius R(t) and the
relative azimuthal angle η(t).51 Unlike in Sec. III A, the mag-
netic texture is not rigid but soft in its overall shape. For

where the + (-) sign stands for the isotropic (anisotropic) DMI
which stabilizes circular (anti-)skyrmions. Performing the ex-
pansion of Eq. (23) in R for a large radius skyrmion we ob-
tain the following dimensionless effective energy in units of

A. Energy landscape analysis

The energy landscape described by the effective model (24)
has two extrema. The ﬁrst is a global energy minimum with
corresponding equilibrium coordinates

˜req =

(cid:114) c2

c1 − c3|g|

,

ηeq =

(cid:40)

0 if 0 < g < 1
π if −1 < g < 0.

(25)

The second represents an energy saddle point with coordi-
nates:

˜rsad =

(cid:114) c2

c1 + c3|g|

,

ηsad =

(cid:40)

π if 0 < g < 1
0 if −1 < g < 0,

(26)
where we note that ˜req > ˜rsad and that their respective effec-
tive energies are Eeq(sad) = 2c2/˜req(sad).

Upon rescaling the radii by the equilibrium radius (r ≡
˜r/˜req) and energy by the equilibrium energy ((cid:15) ≡ E/Eeq)
in (24), the effective energy reduces to the simpliﬁed form

where we have deﬁned B = c3g/c1 as the single parameter
which encapsulates the entire contribution from the material
properties on the physics of the system.
In these units the
saddle point radius is exactly the inverse of the corresponding
sad = (cid:112)(1 − |B|)/(1 + |B|)).
saddle point energy (rsad = (cid:15)−1
A cut along the (cid:15) = (cid:15)sad plane partitions the energy land-
scape into three distinct regions. A schematic view of the
energy landscape is shown in Fig. 2 where individual energy
sectors have been color coded to guide the reader. The (r, η)
coordinates in the bowl and horn regions both correspond to
high energy states ((cid:15) > (cid:15)sad) as opposed to the basin’s low
energy states ((cid:15) < (cid:15)sad).
In the inset of Fig. 2 we show a
cut through η = 0 and η = π to emphasize the structure of
the extrema introduced above. The constant energy trajecto-
ries followed by skyrmions in their conﬁguration space in the
absence of damping (see Fig. 3(a)) are obtained by solving
Eq. (27) for the rescaled radius

While the two solutions in (28) represent distinct horn and
bowl orbits in the (cid:15) > (cid:15)sad regime, they represent the two
branches of the same basin orbit in the (cid:15) < (cid:15)sad case. In all
scenarios, constant energy orbits describe skyrmion breathing
motions as the radius grows and shrinks as a function of η.
The qualitative nature of orbits in the basin and bowl/horn
regions are however very different from each other as the dy-
namical range of η is limited in the basin orbits while it takes
all values from 0 to 2π in the horn/bowl orbits. This leads
us to denominate the high and low energy breathing dynam-
ics as rotating and oscillating modes respectively. The de-
generacy of the rotating modes disappears as their energy is

of m = +1(−1) for skyrmions (antiskyrmions). As such,
we will reduce our discussion to skyrmions only from now on
even though the results derived are valid for antiskyrmions
as well.
In the Appendix C, we discuss how to introduce
other interactions, such as dipole-dipole and bulk DMI into
this framework.

Numerical solutions of Eqs. (31) with and without damping
are shown in Fig. (4a) where the initial energy is set above the
saddle energy. These results show the characteristic transition
from rotating to oscillating phase in the r, η and (cid:15) damped
evolutions as compared to their undamped, constant energy
analogs. All three variables relax towards the equilibrium
state as expected. The rate of energy loss is qualitatively dif-
ferent in the two phases, transitioning from a linear-like to an
exponential decay as further discussed below. Micromagnetic
simulations conﬁrm the qualitative predictions of the effective
energy model as it pertains to the skyrmion breathing modes.
In particular, we observe the rotating (Fig. 4b) and oscillat-
ing (Fig. 4c) breathing regimes and their distinct energy loss
behavior.

B. Results

In the following we present analytical results pertaining to
the expected dynamical periods, breathing amplitudes and en-
ergy decay rates.

lowered through the saddle energy and into the basin. The
horn rotations are unphysical however as they would predict
uncollapsable skyrmions in the limit of very small skyrmion
sizes. Furthermore, since our theory is only applicable for
skyrmion much larger than the proﬁle wall width d, it cannot
reliably describe their behavior at such small radii. Overall,
the dynamical spectrum of this model is reminiscent of that of
a simple pendulum which exhibits rotations and oscillations
around its suspension point depending on whether the kinetic
energy is greater or less than the potential energy of its “upside
down” unstable equilibrium.

Lastly, the full range of the radial oscillations can be read-
ily obtained from Eq. (28) by noting that all radial max-
ima/minima in the orbits appear on the η = 0, π line (as shown
in Fig. 2). For B > 0 the rotating modes have rmax = r±(0)
and rmin = r±(π) whereas in the oscillating phase one has
rmax = r+(0) and rmin = r−(0). Since the lower energy
branch on this line is independent of the coupling B, the am-
plitude for oscillating breathing modes below the saddle en-
ergy is insensitive to material properties (see discussion be-
low).

the case of (cid:15) > (cid:15)sad the positive and negative signs refer to

cal integrations of these formulas show that the period scales
linearly in energy for both the rotating and oscillating breath-
ing modes (see Fig. 5). Our theory allows to explore dynam-
ics beyond the small amplitude limit in an ansatz independent
manner.
It includes, however the small radius perturbation
calculated previously in the literature derived by using a non-
energy-minimizing ansatz. For small oscillations around equi-
librium the period can be computed up to O((cid:15) − 1) as

eling in the undamped dynamical limit. Radial and angu-
lar trajectories obtained by integrating (31) match very well
with equivalent micromagnetic simulations in both rotating
(a) and oscillating (b) regimes. While the oscillating breathing
modes match almost perfectly, a small deviation is seen be-
tween physical and predicted radial dynamics in the rotating
regime. This is due to a breakdown in the large skyrmion ap-
proximation underpinning the theory whenever the skyrmion
contracts to sizes comparable to the proﬁle’s wall width. To
illustrate this, the inset of subﬁgure (a) shows the different
proﬁles observed for maximum and minimum skyrmion radii
throughout one rotational period.

ment for the weak oscillatory breathing, including the expected sim-
ple harmonic motion for small oscillations in (c) about equilibrium,
but our model shows a deviation from the micromagnetic simulations

the large skyrmion radius approximation (see inset in (a)) when the

averaging (36) over constant energy orbits to obtain a single

FIG. 5. Numerical calculations of the periods T ((cid:15)) with B = 0.82.
In the regime (cid:15) > (cid:15)sad, the rotational ‘bowl’ breathing modes are
shown. As expected from equation (33), the period scales linearly
with the system’s energy T ((cid:15)) ∝ (cid:15) in both regimes.

which may be obtained directly from Eq. (28) upon setting
η = 0, π. At energies below the saddle energy ((cid:15) < (cid:15)sad), r+
1
is the maximum radius of oscillations and r−
1 is the minimum
radius of oscillations; meanwhile, for energies above the sad-
dle energy ((cid:15) > (cid:15)sad), r+
1 is the maximum radius of rotations
on the bowl, r+
2 is the minimum radius of rotations on the
bowl, r−
2 is the maximum radius of rotations on the horn, and
r−
1 is the minimum radius of rotations on the horn. We see
from Eq. (35a) that the stationary points of the r-oscillations
for breathing modes below the saddle energy are independent
of the material properties. This may be likened to a mass-
on-a-spring system where the amplitude is fully determined
by the initial extension from equilibrium even though the spe-
ciﬁc dynamics connecting the two extrema of motion do de-
pend on the size of the spring constant and the mass. In this
case this is not a trivial consequence of small harmonic oscil-
lations around equilibrium however because it is true for the
entire 1 < (cid:15) < (cid:15)sad range.

3. Energy Decay Rates

From the expression for the skyrmion’s energy Eq. (27) and
the breathing equations of motion Eq. (31), one can quantify
the energy dissipated by the system as:

which we will use to analytically explain the distinction be-
tween linear and exponential decay observed in the numerical
calculations (see Fig. 4). Since Eq. (36) is globally negative,
except at the energy minimum (r, η) = (1, 0) where it van-
ishes, it correctly describes a dissipative process that relaxes
the skyrmion to its equilibrium state.

where the integrals are performed over one complete oscilla-
tory/rotational orbits (28). In what follows we will leverage
the fact that orbital periods (33) scale linearly with the orbit’s
energy T ((cid:15)) ∝ (cid:15) (see Fig. 5). The above integrals are not ex-
actly solvable but a series of upper and lower bounds can still
be constructed (see Appendix D). For the rotational breathing
mode, one can show that:

decay faster than the true solution of Eq. (36). Since (cid:15) (cid:29) 1

where η+((cid:15)) = cos−1{[1 − (cid:15)2(1 − B)]B−1} is the maximum
range of domain wall tilt angle attained during a single con-
stant energy oscillation. Since the solution of (39) is guaran-
teed to decay slower than that of (36), the true energy loss
in the oscillating regime must decay at least exponentially.
These arguments conﬁrm the sharp transition observed in the
dissipation rate when the skyrmion breathing dynamics cross
the saddle separatrix when transitioning between (cid:15) > (cid:15)sad and
(cid:15) < (cid:15)sad states, see Fig. (4).

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have derived the Hamiltonian system for
the low energy excitations of rotationally symmetric magnetic
(anti-)skyrmions in an ansatz-independent manner. By means
of scaling and symmetry arguments we modeled the breathing
mode of (anti-)skyrmions in terms of collective coordinates,
where the area of reversed spins in the skyrmion core and
the skyrmion phase are conjugated variables in phase space.
As seen from the form of the energy landscape, our model
exhibits a rich behavior which is conﬁrmed by micromag-
netic simulations of (anti-)skyrmion structures in magnetic
substrates with translational invariance along the anisotropy
axis. The main results presented in this paper include the an-
alytical and numerical investigation of the well-known oscil-
latory breathing mode where small amplitude oscillations in
the radius and skyrmion phase around equilibrium proceed in
tandem, as well as the description of rotational breathing be-
havior, characterized by large radius oscillations and a con-
tinuous non-uniform precession of the phase. Furthermore,
we predict two distinct regimes of energy dissipation where
the average power loss of large amplitude rotational breath-
ing modes decays linearly as opposed to exponentially for the
oscillating modes. We expect that these distinctive energy de-
cays will allow to detect the different modes experimentally.
It must be stated that the limit of our model lies in the im-

plicit assumption of ﬁxed skyrmion wall proﬁles. The next
order approximation would be to incorporate the skew of the
wall proﬁle by introducing an additional pair of collective co-
ordinates. Doing so would allow extension of this analysis to
skyrmion radii much smaller than those allowed by this work.
We would like to emphasize that the results described here
hold for both skyrmions and antiskyrmions. Therefore a per-
fect test system will be one where both of them occur simulta-
neously. This is for example naturally the case when skyrmion
and antiskyrmion pairs are created,35,67,68 or in systems with
certain symmetries.36

Appendix A: Poisson brackets

In the main text we applied techniques from Hamiltonian
mechanics. Poisson brackets entered at the level of the col-
lective coordinates where we were concerned with just time
dependent functions, and also at the level of the LLG ﬁeld
equation where the magnetization ﬁeld depends on both space
and time. Below we review equations for Poisson brackets
relevant to this work.

Appendix B: Comparison between generalized Thiele method
and the Hamiltonian formalism

The generalized Thiele method is based on the idea of de-
scribing the dynamics of certain magnetic conﬁgurations just
in terms of the time evolution of a ﬁnite number of collective
coordinates describing the soft modes,39,53 for which we have
that,

(B1)

This decomposition has been successfully applied in the de-
scription of the low energy excitations of topological magnetic
textures. For example, for the ﬁeld-driven or current-driven
motion of domain walls the physics is well described up to a
certain magnitude of the applied driving ﬁeld or current21 by a
soft mode described by the two collective coordinates: the do-
main wall position and the tilt angle of the magnetization in-
side the wall. Another example is the dynamics of the position
(X, Y )(cid:124) of a rigid homogenous domain in steady translational
motion as described by Thiele.56 Considering the expansion
Eq. (B1), performing the projection of the LLG Eq. (1) onto
m × ∂ξim and integrating over volume gives a generalization
of Thiele’s equations39,56,57

11

The result for the dissipative term γξj in terms of the Poisson
brackets {ξi, ξj}ξ,pξ is also derived in a more general manner
(see the main text) and therefore this structure is general for
including viscous damping into Hamilton’s equations, regard-
less of the system of study.

To further illustrate the Hamiltonian approach, we present
as an example the Poisson bracket for X and Y , describing
the position of a skyrmion, for the soft mode associated with
translational motion.

we obtain that the equivalence between the generalized Thiele
approach and Hamiltonian approach is embedded in the fol-
lowing identities

By virtue of Thiele’s traveling wave ansatz, m(r, t) =
m0[r − rs(t)], the unit magnetization has the properties ˙m =
−( ˙rs · ∇)m and ∂X,Y m = −∂x,ym where rs = (X, Y )(cid:124).

Appendix C: Generalizations of the effective model

The arguments used to expand the micromagnetic model
Eq. (23) in powers of R can be used for other interactions, in-
cluding dipole-dipole interactions and bulk DMI. In this note
we brieﬂy outline how to modify the effective energy Eq. (24)
to take into account these terms.

The dipole-dipole interaction is known to produce in thin-
ﬁlms with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy to mod-
ify the strength of the anisotropy,69 Keﬀ = K − 1
2 µ0M 2
s .
Moreover, for circular skyrmions, it also produces a coupling
for the η angle. From symmetry arguments, we argue that
this interaction is invariant under the transformation η → −η.
And, from the scaling argument, we argue that it decays with
the inverse of the radius. Therefore, the contribution to the
η coupling may be written as −cdd(cos2 η)/r where cdd de-
pends on the exact proﬁle of the skyrmion. Usually cdd is at
least an order of magnitude smaller than the other c’s in the
effective energy Eq. (24). This contribution was calculated
using the domain wall ansatz in a previous paper.70

Another example of possible modiﬁcations to the energy is
the generalization of the DMI to include bulk and hybrid DMI.
In the case of hybrid DMI we take into account a combination
of bulk and interfacial DMI.71 The general contribution to the
energy density becomes

˜HDMI = DN (mz∂xmx − mx∂xmz)
± DN (mz∂ymy − my∂ymz)
− DB(mz∂ymx − mx∂ymz)
± DB(mz∂xmy − my∂xmz),

(C1)

where B and N stand for bulk and interfacial DMI respec-
tively, and the different signs correspond to the energies that
stabilizes skyrmions and antiskyrmions, as stated in the main
text. In this case, the effective contribution is given by

˜EDMI(˜r, η) = −˜r(gN cos η + gB sin η).

(C2)

√

where gB,N = πDB,N /4
AK. If neither gB or gN is zero,
it produces an equilibrium η that is different from the usual
N´eel and Bloch skyrmion and can take any value between 0

For the case where we consider that the domain wall width
d is also a function of the radius, we need to keep its explicit
dependence in the effective energy. In this case, by analyzing
the scaling factors before the reparametrization by the domain
wall width ∆ it is possible to obtain the effective energy for
the model Eq. (23),

˜E(˜r, η) =

(cid:16) c12
d

+ c11d − c3g cos η

(cid:17)

˜r +

c21d
˜r

,

(C3)

where c12 and c21 are contributions from the exchange inter-
action, c11 is due to the anisotropy interaction and c3 is due
to DMI. The dependence of d on the DMI strength may be
obtained in two ways. One method is by analyzing the scal-
ing behavior for a rotationally symmetric solution of the LLG
equation in two dimensions. An explicit method is to consider
r, η and d as collective variables and minimizing the energy
for these three parameters. Thereby we obtain,

d =

c3|g|
2c11

.

(C4)

An important remark is that the effective description men-
tioned in this paper is only valid for the case that ˜r (cid:29) d. If
the radius of the skyrmion becomes comparable to the width
of the circular domain wall, it is necessary to consider the so-
lutions for small skyrmions studied in Refs. [23, 24].

The effective energy Eq. (24) gives the static properties ob-
tained in Ref. [63] with c values independent of DMI, while
the model obtained in Eq. (C3) with the width of the skyrmion
given by Eq. (C4) corresponds to the one obtained in Ref. [47].
For the circular domain wall ansatz, the values of the constants
are given by: c3 = 2, c1 = 2, and all other constants c are
equal to 1. The conversion between the constants in the two
approaches (Eq. (24) and Eq. (C3)) is given by,

Calculation of r and η

For the calculation of the skyrmion radius in the simula-
tions we used a linear interpolation between the ﬁnite differ-
ence cells where mz changes sign. For this we picked a ﬁxed
cut through the diameter of the skyrmion since it has no trans-
lational motion.

For the calculation of η we used a marching-squares algo-
rithm to approximate the magnetization along the mz = 0
contour by using image processing tools,73 and then took a
simple average of the η values for the spins along these points,
η = (1/N ) (cid:80)N
i=1 ηi, where ηi = arctan(my,i/mx,i) are the
N wall angles taken along the interpolated contour.

FIG. 7. Transition from rotational breathing to oscillatory breathing
from a micromagnetic simulation, showing one full rotation before
traversing the saddle energy. The point where the energy drops below
the energy saddle is estimated by closely inspecting the energy signal
to ﬁnd a sharp drop. The parameters in this simulation are α = 0.1,
D = 2.8 × 10−3Jm−2, A = 1.5 × 10−11 Jm−1 and K = 1.1 × 106
Jm−3, i.e. g = 0.54.

Appendix E: Details on micromagnetic simulations

Simulation geometry details for Figs. 4–5

All simulations used a mesh of uniformly-discretized cubic
ﬁnite difference cells with periodic boundary conditions to ap-
proximate an inﬁnite thin ﬁlm system. Figure 4(b) and (c) in
the main text used 1024 × 1024 × 1 nodes with cell length
0.25nm. Figure 6 used,

The transition from rotations to oscillations

Observing a transition from the rotating-like breathing be-
havior and small oscillatory-like breathing in the micromag-
netic simulations is non-trivial. This can be understood from
the results reported in the main text as follows. The ampli-
tude of the breathing motion is larger for higher energies, so
the total size of the magnetic material has to be sufﬁciently
large. At the same time there also needs to be many ﬁnite dif-
ference cells because the trajectory of a breathing skyrmion
typically passes close to the saddle point during the transi-
tion from the bowl region to the basin region and because the
saddle point radius is always small, rsad < 1.
In addition
our model is intended to be more accurate for larger radius
skyrmions, suggesting that best results should come for high
coupling constants |B|. And yet we have the difﬁculty that
rsad → 0+ as |B| → 1−. This presents a quandary: the more
reliable we take the micromagnetic parameters in order to as-
sess the model, the longer the simulations will last due to re-
quiring more simulation cells to maintain numerical stability.
Nonetheless, the transition can still be obtained, see Fig. 7.
