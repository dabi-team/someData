ABSTRACT

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are highly dynamic events originating in the solar atmosphere,
that show a wide range of kinematic properties and are the major drivers of the space weather.
The angular width of the CMEs is a crucial parameter in the study of their kinematics. The fact
that whether slow and fast CMEs (as based on their relative speed to the average solar wind
speed) are associated with different processes at the location of their ejection is still debatable.
Thus, in this study, we investigate their angular width to understand the differences between the
slow and fast CMEs. We study the width distribution of slow and fast CMEs and ﬁnd that they
follow different power law distributions, with a power law indices (α) of -1.1 and -3.7 for fast and
slow CMEs respectively. To reduce the projection effects, we further restrict our analysis to only
limb events as derived from manual catalog and we ﬁnd similar results. We then associate the
slow and fast CMEs to their source regions, and classiﬁed the sources as Active Regions (ARs)
and Prominence Eruptions (PEs). We ﬁnd that slow and fast CMEs coming from ARs and PEs,
also follow different power laws in their width distributions. This clearly hints towards a possibility
that different mechanisms might be involved in the width expansion of slow and fast CMEs coming
from different sources.These results are also crucial from the space weather perspective since
the width of the CME is an important factor in that aspect.

1 INTRODUCTION
Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) consist of plasma and magnetic ﬁeld that are expelled from the solar
atmosphere into the heliosphere at speeds which can range from 100 – 3000 km s−1 (Yashiro et al., 2004;
Gopalswamy, 2004, 2010; Manoharan and Mujiber Rahman, 2011; Webb and Howard, 2012). They appear

as bright, white-light features moving outward in the coronagraph ﬁeld of view (FOV) (Hundhausen
et al., 1984; Schwenn, 1996). Though, early observations of CMEs date back to 1970s (Hansen et al.,
1971), it is Tousey (1973) who ﬁrst observed CMEs in the coronagraph images (see recent review by
Gopalswamy, 2016, on the history of CMEs). Since the launch of the Large Angle and Spectrometric
Coronagraph (LASCO) (Brueckner et al., 1995) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and
Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) (Howard et al., 2008) on the
Solar Terrestrial Relation Observatory (STEREO), CMEs are being routinely monitored.

CMEs are the major drivers of space weather, as they are capable of producing shock waves and
interplanetary disturbances (Gosling et al., 1991; Gosling, 1993), where the height of formation of the
shock wave can often be estimated from the radio observations (Gopalswamy et al., 2013). Recently,
Vourlidas et al. (2020) have outlined the role of radio observations of CMEs during different stages of
the CME eruption and its subsequent propagation in the heliosphere. Thus it is important to understand
the kinematics of CMEs. CMEs during their radial propagation, have been known to follow a three phase
kinematic proﬁle (Zhang et al., 2001; Zhang and Dere, 2006; Webb and Howard, 2012). During their
propagation, they interact with the ambient solar wind and experience a drag, which leads to a decreasing or
constant speed in the later stages of their propagation (Webb and Howard, 2012). This average solar wind
speed reportedly divides the CMEs into slow and fast (Gopalswamy et al., 2000). CMEs are also known to
be associated with active regions and eruptive prominences (Webb and Howard, 2012; Subramanian and
Dere, 2001). These two classes of source regions of CMEs tend to associate CMEs to two distinct classes
(MacQueen and Fisher, 1983). Later, Sheeley et al. (1999) used the data from LASCO and conﬁrmed this
classiﬁcation by suggesting that there are two dynamical classes of CMEs, which are gradual and impulsive
CMEs. The former are slower and are preferentially associated with eruptive prominences, whereas, the
latter CMEs are faster and are mostly associated with ﬂares and active regions. So, it seems that these two
classes of source regions of CMEs also tend to segregate CMEs into being gradual or impulsive events.
The most intriguing question in this context is whether there are two physically different processes that are
involved in the launch of these slow and fast CMEs or whether they belong to a dynamical continuum with
a single uniﬁed process, the answer to which is still not clear (also see Webb and Howard, 2012).

Apart from their radial propagation, CMEs are also known to exhibit lateral expansion that leads to
an increase in their angular width as they propagate outwards (Kay et al., 2015; Cremades et al., 2020;
Majumdar et al., 2020) and that it is the Lorentz force at their source region that is closely responsible for
translating and expanding them (Subramanian et al., 2014). In this regard, Zhao et al. (2017) reported on
the importance of the angular width of a CME, in determining whether the corresponding interplanetary
CME and the preceding shock will reach Earth. Lugaz et al. (2017a) reported on the importance of studying
the expansion in slow CMEs on their ability to drive shocks. The width of the CME also sheds light on the
source region of the CME it is coming from. Moore et al. (2007) showed that the strength of the magnetic
ﬁeld of the source region ﬂare arcade producing a CME can be estimated from the ﬁnal angular width of
the CME and the angular width of the ﬂare arcade. Recently Majumdar et al. (2020) connected 3D proﬁles
of width evolution to the 3D acceleration proﬁles of slow and fast CMEs and found that the vanishing of the
initial impulsive acceleration phase and the ceasing of width expansion phase both tend to occur in a height
range of 2.5-3 R(cid:12), thus showing the observational evidence of the height of impact of Lorentz force on
CME kinematics. So, it is evident that the width of a CME is an essential ingredient in the understanding
of their kinematics, and is also an important parameter for the consideration of their space weather impact.
Furthermore, since the width largely inﬂuences the kinematics of CMEs, it is still not known whether we
observe any differences in the angular width distribution of slow and fast CMEs originating from different
source regions.

Power laws in CME widths

It has also been reported that the width distribution of CMEs follow a power law (Yashiro et al., 2006;
Robbrecht et al., 2009; D’Huys et al., 2014). A study of the statistical distribution of a physical parameter
sheds light on the underlying physics of it, and a presence of power law in the distribution of a quantity
indicates the presence of Self-Organized Criticality (Bak et al., 1987). The presence of power laws, and
hence Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) in nature have become evident in the last few years in many
different areas and astrophysical phenomena (Aschwanden et al., 2018, and references therein). The
presence of power laws in solar astrophysics, in the global energetics of solar ﬂares, has also been reported
by Aschwanden (2016). Thus, a study of the distribution of the angular width of CMEs should provide
important clues in understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for expanding the CMEs. Recently,
Bidhu et al. (2017) studied the distribution of width of CMEs during the maximum phase of solar cycle 23
and 24. Meng et al. (2014) studied the distribution of CME width and its comparison with the phase of
sunspot number in solar cycle 23. Inspite of these studies, whether the slow and fast CMEs follow different
width distributions or whether there is any imprint of the source regions on the width distribution of these
slow and fast CMEs, is still not properly understood. Thus it is worth looking at the width distribution of
slow and fast CMEs and also if there is any imprint of the source region of these two dynamical classes on
their width distribution.

Motivated by the above ﬁndings and the deﬁcit in our understanding of these slow and fast CMEs, we in
this work study the width distribution of slow and fast CMEs that occurred during different phases of cycle
23 and 24. We outline the data sources and the working method in Section 2, followed by our results in
Section 3. Finally, we outline our main conclusions from this work in Section 4.

2 DATA AND METHOD
2.1 Data Source

We use the data from CDAW catalogue for the analysis presented in this paper. The CDAW catalog lists the
properties of CMEs detected manually (Yashiro et al., 2004; Gopalswamy et al., 2009) in SOHO/LASCO
images. The work on source region identiﬁcation and segregation is done with the images taken by
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) (Lemen et al., 2011)
and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on-board STEREO (for details, refer to Section 2.4) .
2.2 Event Selection

We have selected the CMEs from the CDAW catalogue that have occurred during different phases of
solar cycle 23 and 24. For the analysis presented in this work, we ﬁrst remove the “very poor” CMEs from
the CDAW catalog. Wang and Colaninno (2014) reported that the detection of “very poor” CMEs are based
on the discretion of manual operators, we discard such CMEs in order to remove any bias from our analysis.
It should be noted that some of the “very poor” CMEs may be the real CMEs but we remove them from the
analysis because there are large errors in the measurement of the properties of such CMEs. Furthermore,
we impose a lower threshold of 30◦ on CME width to remove narrow CMEs. Yashiro et al. (2008) and
Gopalswamy et al. (2010) have reported that there exists a discrepancy in the detection of the number
of CMEs with width < 30◦ when both CACTus and CDAW catalogs were compared. Also Yashiro et al.
(2003) studied the statistical properties of narrow CMEs, and reported that they do not form a subset of
normal CMEs and have different acceleration mechanism. In addition to a lower threshold, we also apply
an upper threshold of 180◦ on the width because such CMEs mostly suffer from projection effects and thus
the width estimation will be affected. It is worth noting that CMEs with width between 30◦ and 180◦ also
suffer from projection effects. In order to reduce projection effects, we also use limb CMEs (whose source
regions were found within 30◦ of the limb) for the analysis. The selection criteria for the limb CMEs is
reported in Gopalswamy et al. (2014).

2.3 Segregation of CMEs into slow and fast

After shortlisting the CMEs based on the above selection criteria, we segregate the CMEs as slow and
fast based on their speeds. CMEs are usually classiﬁed as slow and fast relative to the speed of the solar
wind. The slow solar wind typically has speeds less than 400 km s−1 while the fast solar wind has speeds
greater 400 km s−1 (see, Schwenn, 2006). Therefore, 400 km s−1 can be taken as the average solar wind
speed for a long term statistical study. We classify CMEs with speeds less than 300 km s−1 as slow CMEs
and those with speeds greater than 500 km s−1 as fast CMEs. We consider CMEs with speeds between
300 km s−1 to 500 km s−1 as intermediate CMEs, as they cannot be strictly categorised as either slow or
fast CMEs because of uncertainties in speed measurements. It is worth noting at this point that the speeds
of CMEs listed in the CDAW catalog are the speeds with which the leading edge of a CME propagates.
Table 1 lists the number of fast and slow CMEs in the CDAW catalog.

2.4 Segregation of the slow and fast CMEs on the basis of their source region

After segregating the CMEs as slow and fast, we search their source regions on the solar disk. For this
we included a total of 1064 events that occurred during 2000 to 2002, 2008, 2009, and also from 2012 to
2014, which covers the maxima of cycle 23, the minima of cycle 24 and the maxima of cycle 24. Here, we
have followed a similar method as reported in Majumdar et al. (2020) and using the JHelioviewer software
(Muller et al., 2009; M¨uller et al., 2017) to back-project the CMEs onto the solar disk. We further segregated
the identiﬁed source regions of the CMEs into two broad categories, namely (i) Active Regions(ARs) and
(ii) Prominence Eruptions(PEs). We deﬁne them as follows:

Figure 1. (Left)Active regions (ARs) as observed in the corona on 03-05-2012. The image is taken by
AIA 171 ˚A. The ARs (pointed out in the ﬁgure by circular marks with AR written on them), are identiﬁed
as bright regions, being hotter and denser than the background coronal plasma, showing strong magnetic
activity. (Right) Prominence Eruptions (PEs, enclosed in green box) as observed in the corona on 08-04-
2012. This image is taken by AIA 304 ˚A. The dark strands of plasma as seen projected against the disk of
the sun are ﬁlaments (at a position angle of 40◦ and 300◦ in this image), whereas the same object is termed
as a prominence when observed at the solar limb (at a position angle of 235◦ in this image).

Active Regions(ARs) (refer Figure 1) are prime features making up only a small fraction of the total
surface area of the Sun, but harbouring most of the solar activity (Webb and Howard, 2012). These being
areas of strong magnetic ﬁeld, are predominantly hotter and denser than the background coronal plasma,
producing bright emission in the soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet regions. In order to identify ARs, we
look into the images taken by (i) the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT; Delaboudini`ere et al.,

1995) (195 ˚A) onboard SOHO, (ii) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al., 2011) (171 ˚A,
193 ˚A) onboard SDO, and also (iii) the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI; Wuelser et al., 2004)(171
˚A, 195 ˚A) onboard STEREO SECCHI. We also detect the ARs by the Active Region numbers provided
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as supplied by Space Weather Event
Knowledgebase (SWEK) using Jhelioviewer1 (M¨uller et al., 2017) .

Prominences (refer Figure 1) are cool dense material (8000 K) embedded in the hotter corona, observed
as an emission feature when seen at the solar limb, and an absorption feature when seen projected against
the background hotter corona (termed as ﬁlament) (Gilbert et al., 2000). We classify an eruption as a
prominence eruption if we see a strong radial component of motion away from the solar surface where
all or some of the prominence material is seen to escape the gravitational ﬁeld of the Sun. For a ﬁlament
eruption (we include these in the same category with prominence eruption) we either looked for tangential
motion across the solar surface with a subsequent eruption, or simply by observing any disappearance of
the ﬁlament in the subsequent images with a transient coronal manifestation following it (also refer Webb
and Hundhausen (1987)). It is also important to note that, there can be possibilities of failed eruptions (Joshi
et al., 2013a), CME-jet interactions (Duan et al., 2019; Solanki et al., 2020), and CME-CME interactions
(Joshi et al., 2013b; Lugaz et al., 2017b) which can inﬂuence the kinematic properties. Furthermore, CMEs
are also observed to be associated with coronal jets, miniﬁlaments, etc (Liu et al., 2015; Solanki et al.,
2019; Duan et al., 2019). It is also not properly understood whether such CMEs can be categorised as the
active region eruptions and prominence eruptions or classiﬁed as a different category. Thus, in the present
work, we exclude such events. Furthermore, CMEs are also related to the active region ﬁlaments, however,
due to the lack of comparable statistics with the other two classes (ARs and PEs), we have excluded such
events from our analysis. To detect PEs, we look into the images taken by, (i) EIT 195 ˚A, 304 ˚A, (ii) AIA
304 ˚A, and (iii) EUVI 304 ˚A. Finally, it should be borne in mind that kinematic properties of CMEs largely
depend on the overlying ﬁeld strength and decay index (Joshi et al., 2013a; Xu et al., 2012). In this work
we do not consider these effects into account.

For a spatial association (see Gilbert et al., 2000; Majumdar et al., 2020) between a source region and a
subsequent CME, we require that the latitude of the source region to be around ± 30◦ to that of the PA
of the center of the CME as reported in the CDAW catalogue. In the case of a ﬁlament eruption, due to
larger uncertainty of its spatial location, we look for an erupting ﬁlament around ± 40◦ around the PA of
the CME converted to equivalent apparent latitude (latP A) by the following relation:

latP A = 90 − P A [0 ≤ P A ≤ 180]

latP A = P A − 270

[180 < P A ≤ 360].

(1)

For a temporal association we consider source region to erupt or show radially outward movement in the
above latitude window in a time interval of at least 30 minutes before the ﬁrst appearance of the leading
front in the LASCO C2 ﬁeld of view.

3 DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
3.1 Width distribution of CMEs

Recently, it has been reported that the CMEs evolve non self-similarly in the inner corona (see Majumdar
et al., 2020; Cremades et al., 2020). In the CDAW catalog, the width of a CME is deﬁned as the maximum
angle subtended by a CME on the center of the Sun when the CME enters the LASCO C3 ﬁeld of view

Power laws in CME widths

(FOV) where the width appears to approach a constant value (Gopalswamy, 2004). To investigate the width
distribution of CMEs during solar cycle 23 and 24, we ﬁt a power law to it as follows:

N (W ) = CW α,

(2)

where N is the number of CMEs with width W , α is the power-law exponent, and C a constant. In Figure 2
we plot the histogram (left panel) of the width distribution and the width distribution in log scale (right
panel) with the power law ﬁt for all CMEs excluding the ”very poor” events as mentioned in the CDAW
catalogue. It is worth noting that after removing “very poor” CMEs from our analysis, we believe that
we have reduced the bias introduced by manual operators, respectively. We ﬁnd a power law index of
-1.9. In order to understand the goodness of ﬁt we perform the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) test where the
KS distance (see Clauset et al., 2007) which is deﬁned as the maximum distance between the empirical
distribution function of the sample and cumulative distribution function of the assumed expression, is
minimum for the distribution which ﬁts the data best with a corresponding high p-value that gives the
probability conﬁdence. Here we ﬁnd the KS distance and p-value as 0.13 and 0.99. It is worth noting from
Figure 2, that the width distribution is not ﬁtted well by a single power law. This serves as a motivation for
us to investigate power laws segregating fast and slow CMEs
Since we aim to understand the width distribution of slow and fast CMEs, we next remove the intermediate
events from our study sample, as such events are neither fast nor slow (refer section 3.2). We again study
the width distribution of all events except the ”very poor” and the intermediate events (Figure 3). We
ﬁnd that after removing the intermediate events, we still get the same power law index of -1.9 with the
KS distance and p-value to be the almost same. Thus we ensure that there is no bias introduced in the
estimation of the power law index of widths distribution by rejecting the intermediate events from our
sample. The graphical ﬁtting (GF) of the data points used above is not the best method to estimate the
power-law, especially when number of data points is small (D’Huys et al., 2016). Therefore, we also use
maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) ﬁtting method to derive the power-law index, α. Using MLE, we get
the power law index to be -1.6 which again remains the same for CMEs with or without the intermediate
events.

Now that we have ensured that the exclusion of the intermediate events does not affect our study, we try

to understand now if the slow and fast CMEs follow different power laws in their width distribution.

3.2 Width distribution of slow and fast CMEs

In this section we study the width distribution of slow and fast CMEs separately. We use the same power
law distribution as mentioned in equation 2. Figure 4 (a) shows the histograms of the width distribution of
fast (black line) and slow (blue line) CMEs using CDAW catalog after excluding the “very poor” CMEs
and the intermediate CMEs. Figure 4 (b), shows the width distributions in log scale. Black and blue lines
represent the best ﬁt power-laws obtained for the fast and slow CMEs, respectively using least square ﬁtting
method. We estimate α as -1.3 and -3.8 for fast and slow CMEs respectively. Thus we ﬁnd that the slow
and fast CMEs follow different power laws in their width distribution, but to get a better conﬁdence on our
result, we again perform power law ﬁtting by MLE.

It should be noted that the number of slow CMEs in CDAW catalog with widths less than 70◦ ﬂattens.
This could partially be due to the observational limitations of C2 coronagraph or human subjectivity or
both. The minimum width for the graphical ﬁtting is decided by visually inspecting the distribution and
choosing the width beyond which the distribution is supposedly following a power-law. Thus, we ﬁt the tail

of the width distribution of slow CMEs with a power-law. Later, we used MLE to derive the minimum
width beyond which the distribution is best represented by the power law.

We performed MLE ﬁtting in two different ways. First we set the minimum width value, Wm as 30◦ for
both fast CMEs and slow CMEs and estimate the power-law index. Second, we derive the minimum width
value, Wd for both fast and slow CMEs by minimising the KS distance and estimate the power-law index.

The second method tells us that beyond Wd, the data points best follow the power-law. Table 1 lists the
power indices estimated using two methods described above for fast and slow CMEs. We see that indeed
the slow and fast CMEs follow distinctly different power laws in their width distribution.

We also remove the CMEs labelled as “poor” in the CDAW catalog to study their effects on the width
distribution. We ﬁnd that removal of both “poor” and “very poor” CMEs has little effect on the width
distribution and power-law indices (see, Figures 4 (c) and (d) and Table 1) of slow and fast CMEs. The
speeds listed in the CDAW catalog are the projected speeds in the plane of sky measured at a ﬁxed position
angle. Therefore, applying a speed threshold uniformly to all CMEs introduces projection effects. In order
to reduce projection effects, we also estimate the power-law for fast and slow limb CMEs in solar cycles 23
and 24. First we plot CMEs with all velocities whose widths fall between 30–180◦ (top panel of Figure 5).
We estimate the power index of -1.5 and -1.19 using the GF and MLE methods for the minimum width
threshold of 30◦. Then, we segregate fast and slow CMEs and estimate the power indices using the GF
(bottom panel of Figure 5) and MLE methods (see Table 1). We ﬁnd that the power indices for fast and slow
limb CMEs are different from each other; they are different from the power index of non–limb fast and
slow CMEs. One of the reasons for this discrepancy is the small number of slow and fast limb CMEs. From
Table 1, we note that the fast and slow limb CMEs are 10–20 times less than fast and slow CMEs when
non-limb events are also considered. To evaluate the goodness of ﬁt we again estimate the KS distance.
The KS distances for fast limb CMEs and all fast CMEs are 0.09 and 0.01, respectively. The critical values
of KS distances with 99% of conﬁdence limit for fast limb CMEs and all fast CMEs are 0.1 and 0.03,
respectively. Smaller the KS distance, better is the ﬁt. Similarly, KS distances for slow limb CMES and all
slow CMEs are 0.04 and 0.02, respectively. Further, critical KS distance at 99% of conﬁdence limit for
slow limb CMEs and all slow CMEs are 0.13 and 0.03, respectively.Thus the power indices corresponding
to the limb CMEs differ from that of non-limb cases. We want to emphasize that the slow CME power-law
is steeper than that of the fast CMEs in both cases, although the values may differ. However, the limb CME
values may be closer to reality because of minimal projection effects. It should be noted that the results
are consistent with the speed–width relation as reported in Gopalswamy et al. (2014); where authors have
reported wider CMEs tend to propagate faster than narrow CMEs. Also, we note that the KS distance of
fast CMEs without“very poor” and intermediate events is of an order of magnitude better than KS distance
estimated by ﬁtting a single power law to all CMEs. This demonstrates that fast and slow CMEs are better
represented by different power-laws than fast and slow CMEs combined.

Power laws in CME widths

3.3 Width distribution of slow and fast CMEs coming from ARs and PEs

In previous sections, we note that the slow and fast CMEs follow different power laws. This lights on the
fact that may be the slow and fast CMEs have different physics involved in the mechanism that leads to
their expansion and hence their widths. Since Lorentz force is responsible for propelling and expanding
a CME (refer Section 1), we expect to see its imprint in the width distribution of slow and fast CMEs
originating from different source regions.

overplotted in blue. (c) and (d) are the same as (a) and (b) but exclude “poor” and “very poor” CMEs from
the CDAW catalog.

The entries in Table 2 have been computed by taking events from different phases of cycle 23 and 24 as
mentioned in Section 2.4. After segregating the source regions, their width distribution is studied separately.
Here we use a similar power-law ﬁtting to the width distribution of CMEs coming from the two source
regions. We do power-law ﬁtting by graphical ﬁtting and also by MLE to estimate power-law indices.

Slow CMEs

Figures 6 and 7 show the width distribution of slow and fast CMEs originating from ARs and PEs, and
plotted alongside it are the power-law ﬁt (in black). We get α as -1.29 and -3.43 for fast CMEs coming
from ARs and PEs with a KS distance of 0.13 ( p-value 0.99) and 0.22 (p-value 0.86) respectively. Thus we
see that indeed the width distribution of fast CMEs have different power indices for CMEs originating from
ARs and PEs. In the case of slow CMEs we get α as -3.20 and -3.53 for CMEs from ARs and PEs with a
KS distance of 0.14 (p-value 0.99) and 0.21 (p-value 0.86) respectively. Thus for slow CMEs too the power
indices are slightly different for CMEs from ARS and PEs. Again, GF is not the best method to estimate
the power-law since the number of data points is small here, by using MLE ﬁtting, we get α as -1.23 and
-2.00 for fast CMEs coming from ARs and PEs respectively, whereas for slow CMEs we get α as -1.91

and -2.08 for CMEs from ARs and PEs keeping Wm = 30◦ (refer, table 2). The 1-sigma error involved for
power-law ﬁtting of width of fast CMEs from ARs and PEs are 0.22 and 0.24 respectively, and that for
slow CMEs from ARs and PEs are 0.14 and 0.03 respectively. Table 2 clearly depicts that the power-laws
followed by slow and fast CMEs coming from ARs and PEs are distinctly different and thus supports our
earlier conjecture. We note that although the slow CMEs are seen to follow a steeper power-law than the
fast ones (as we have found earlier), the difference in power law indices is more pronounced for the case
of CMEs associated with the ARs. Furthermore, CMEs associated with prominence eruptions and slow
CMEs have steeper power index than fast CMEs coming from the active regions. The power index of fast
CMEs matches with those estimated for ﬂares. Thus it is evident that possibly the mechanism involved in

the width expansion of slow and fast CMEs are different for the CMEs originating from ARs and PEs. We
also note that the p-value for the power law ﬁt to the width distribution for CMEs from different sources is
lower, and this is due to the lower statistics that we have in each cases.

Thus the fact that slow and fast CMEs from ARs and PEs following different power laws in their width
distribution vividly points towards a possibly different mechanism that leads to the width expansion of
these CMEs and hence demands a more deeper understanding of the same. It should be noted that a few
studies Zuccarello et al. (2014); Seaton et al. (2011); O’Kane et al. (2019) have tried to explore the possible
mechanims of the CMEs but these studies are conﬁned to isolated cases of CMEs. Also, a few statistical
studies on large number of CMEs suggested that there may be different classes of CMEs with different
driving mechanisms (St. Cyr et al., 1999; Subramanian and Dere, 2001; Moon et al., 2002).

From Figures 6 and 7 we also note that in case of the fast CMEs, effect of change in source region is
more pronounced unlike the case for slow events. The limit of the ﬁeld strength in the source region could
be the physical reason for the strength of ﬁeld in ARs, which in turn determines the available energy to
power the eruptions, whereas in case of the CMEs from PEs, the magnetic structure in the periphery of
the ejection site controls the chances of ejection and eventually the observed kinematic properties of the
ejected material (Gopalswamy, 2017). So, possibly a different mechanism governs the width expansion of
CMEs coming from ARs and PEs, irrespective of them being slow or fast.

4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we study the width distribution of CMEs that occurred during different phases of solar cycle
23 and 24. The CMEs were then segregated into slow (≤ 300 km s−1) and fast CMEs (≥ 500 km s−1)
based on the average solar wind speed, and then their width distribution was studied. We further associate
the slow and fast CMEs to the source regions they originated from, and classiﬁed the identiﬁed source
regions into two broad categories, ARs and PEs. We investigate if the source regions have any imprint on
the width distribution of these slow and fast CMEs. The data from the CDAW catalogue has been used
throughout this study. In the following, we conclude our main results from this work.

1. CMEs excluding ‘very poor’ events from the CDAW catalogue tend to follow a power law in their
width distribution with a power law index of -1.9 (Figure 2). Using MLE, we ﬁnd the power law index
to be -1.6. This power law index remains unchanged on the exclusion of the intermediate events from
our sample set (Figure 3). Thus the intermediate events do not affect our results and thus we removed
them from our sample set, as they cannot be strictly considered either slow or fast. Using GF method,
we note that a single power law is unable to explain the observed distribution.

2. We ﬁnd different power indices for the width distribution of fast and slow CMEs (see Table 1). To
reduce the projection effects from our results, we study the width distribution of slow and fast limb
CMEs, and we found that they follow different power laws and the results remain unchanged. However,
the absolute value of power indices are not the same as compared to limb and non limb CMEs which
may be due to poor statistics, as demonstrated by KS test. Since both fast and slow limb and non-limb
CMEs follow different power-laws in width distribution, we believe that slow and fast CMEs may have
different energy sources and generation mechanisms.

3. We study the width distribution of slow and fast CMEs coming from different source regions (ARs
and PEs), and ﬁnd that the power law indices are different for CMEs coming from ARs and PEs (refer
Table 2). Furthermore, CMEs coming from PEs tend to follow a steeper power law irrespective of their
speeds. Also, we ﬁnd that slow CMEs tend to follow a steeper power law than fast CMEs, irrespective

of the source region they are coming from. This clearly hints towards a possibly different mechanism
for width expansion of these CMEs.

Thus we ﬁnd from this study that apart from their speeds, slow and fast CMEs are also distinctly
different in terms of the distribution of their angular width in each case. We believe that this study will
help in a better understanding of the mechanism of width expansion of slow and fast CMEs coming
from different source regions, and in establishing the width of a CME as a crucial parameter in the
study of kinematics of CMEs and their ejection mechanisms. Extending this work on a larger sample
of CMEs using de-projection methods will further help in better conﬁrmation of our conclusions.
