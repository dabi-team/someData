Abstract 

Novel  transverse-momentum  technique  is  used  to  analyse  charged-particle 

exclusive  data  for  collective  motion  in  the  Ar+KCl  reaction  at  1.8  GeV/nucl. 

Previous  analysis  of  this  reaction,  employing  the  standard  sphericity  tensor, 

revealed  no  significant  effect. 

In  the  present  analysis,  collective  effects 

are  observed,  and  they  are  substantially  stronger  than  in  the  Cugnon  cascade 

model,  but  weaker  than  in  the  hydrodynamic  model.

Much  experimental  and  theoretical  attention  in  the  study  of  high-energy 

heavy-ion  collisions  has  been  devoted  to  the  possible  existence  of  collective 

motion,  following  decompression  of  highly  excited  nuclear  matter.  Evidence 

has  been  claimed  from  two-particle  correlations  [1]  and  from  sphericity 

analysis  [2].  The  extraction  of  collective  flow  parameters  from  data  and  the 

comparison  with  theoretical  predictions,  such  as  those  of  the  cascade  [3]  and 

hydrodynamic  [4]  models  is  made  difficult  by  the  existence  of  statistical 

fluctuations.  To  recognize  this,  it  is  easy  to  see  that  a  spherical  momentum 

distribution,  populated  at  random  by  a  finite  number  of  particles,  will  yield 

a  reaction  plane,  an  elongated  sphericity  tensor,  and  a  finite  collective  flow 

angle.  The  magnitude  of  the  uninteresting  statistical  effects  will  depend  on 

the  multiplicity  of  particles. 

In  this  letter  we  isolate  collective  motion  in  the  Ar+KCl(l.8  GeV/nucl) 

reaction  [5],  with  a  novel  transverse-momentum  analysis  method.  Transverse 

momentum  (see  also  refs.  [6])  is  selected  to  avoid  any  possible  effects  due  to 

nuclear  transparency  and  corona  [7]  effects  that  would  be  manifested  primarily 

in  the  longitudinal  momenta.  We  determine  the  reaction  plane  in  the 

collisions,  and  show  how  to  estimate  its  uncertainty.  We  show  how  to  remove 

finite-multiplicity  distortions  from  events  rotated  to  the  reaction  plane,  and 

present  the  collective  effects  as  the  distribution  of  average  transverse 

momenta  projected  onto  the  reaction  plane,  as  a  function  of  rapidity.  By  this 

means  we  are  able  to  demonstrate  collective  motion  in  a  reaction  for  which  the 

sphericity  method  was  inconclusive  [5].  We  complement  the  results  with  a  new 

evaluation  of  the  parameters  of  the  sphericity  matrix. 

The  semi-exclusive  data  of  the  near-symmetric  Ar+KCl(l.8  GeV/nucl) 

reaction  come  from  central-trigger  measurements  in  the  streamer  chamber  at  the 

2 

Bevalac.  Details  of  the  experiment  have  been  reported  previously  [5].  The 

analysed  495  collision  events  were  processed  for  protons,  deuterons,  tritons, 

n+,  and  n- from  the  reaction.  The  central-trigger  cross-section  of  180  mb 

corresponds  in  the  geometric  picture  to  a  cutoff  in  the  impact  parameter  at 

b  <  2.4  fm. 

We  define  a  vector  constructed  from  the  transverse  momenta  p1  of

The  quantity  ~  is 

for  yv  <  Ye  - ~,  and 

to  choose  Ye  equal  to 

determination  of  the  reaction  plane  but  do  contribute  unwanted  fluctuations. 

For  this  reaction  we  take  ~  = 0.3  which  excludes  35%  of  detected  nuclear 

fragments.  The  direction  of  the  vector  Q can  finally  be  used  to  estimate  the 

reaction  plane  in  an  event,  and  its  magnitude  to  determine  average  momentum 

transfer  in  the  reaction. 

To  estimate  the  accuracy  of  the  procedure  we  divided  randomly  each  event 

into  two,  and  compared  the  reaction  planes  extracted  from  the  two  sub-events. 

The  azimuthal  correlation  between  the  constructed  vectors  ~I  and  ~II  is  shown 

in  fig.  la.  The  fact  that  the  distribution  is  not  flat  testifies  to  the 

determination  of  the  reaction  plane.  To  verify  that  this  result  is  not  due  to 

inefficiencies  in  the  streamer  chamber  acceptance,  we  performed  a  similar  test 

3 

using  Monte-Carlo  events  generated  by  mixing  particles  from  events  within  the 

same  multiplicity  range.  The  resulting  distribution  is  shown  in  fig.  lb. 

It 

is  completely  flat.  Arguing  with  the  central-limit  theorem  and  small-angle 

expansion  one  can  deduce  that  the  distribution  of  the  observed  Q with  respect 

to  the  reaction  plane  should  be  more  narrow  than  that  of  fig.  la  by  a  factor 

-

• 

o 

(Av'2  factor  in  the  width  reduction  comes  from  the  increase  in 
of  2. 
multiplicity,  and  a .J2.  from  the  change  from  a  deviation  between  two  sampling 
vectors,  to  a  deviation  from  plane.)  The  optimal  choice  of  & in  the 

definition  of  Q can  be  made  to  minimize  the  width  of  the  distribution 

in  fig.  la.  To  verify  that  the  result  is  not  dominated  by  a  few  particles,  we 

removed  from  each  event  the  four  particles  with  the  highest  transverse  momenta 

in  Q.  The  correlation  was  slightly  diminished,  but  remained  within  the  error 

bars  of  fig.  la. 

We  turn  to  a  discussion  of  the  magnitude  of  Q. 

If  Q were  just  a  sum  of 

randomly  oriented  momenta,  then  we  should  have  th;  avera;e  Q2 = ~p12 • 
However,  from  the  data  we  get 

To  the  extent  that  correlations,  other  than  that  stemming  from  existence  of  the 

reaction  plane  (initial  state  of  the  collision),  are  weak,

with  the  averages  at  the  r.h.s.  of  (3)  taken  in  the  coordinate  system 

associated  with  the  reaction  plane,  and  x  denoting  a  vector  component  in  the 

reaction  plane.  With  a  fragment  mass  a,  and  the  total  mass  A=  ~a, we 

\) 

estimate  average  momenta  per  nucleon  in  the  reaction  plane  from

and  the  average  transverse-momentum  transfer  in  the  reaction  plane,  Qx,  with 

Qx  =A·  wpx/a  =  2.17  :1:  0.11  GeV/c

(for  practical  purposes  this  is  square  root  of  the  numerical  value  of  eq.  (2)).

Utilizing  (4),  the  experimental  p12

,  and  multiplicities,  we  attempted  to 

simulate  the  data  with  two  Gaussian  sources  associated  with  the  reaction  plane 

in  the  transverse-momentum  space.  The  simulation  reproduces  nontrivial 
Ji-data-averages,  and  also  distributions,  like  dN/dQ2•  Carrying  with  the 

sources  the  procedure  as  with  data  for  fig.  la,  we  get  the  dashed  line 

in  fig.  la.  The  solid  line  in  fig.  la  indicates  the  azimuthal  angle 

distribution  of  Q from  the  sources  with  respect  to  the  reaction  plane.  The 

distribution  is  broad,  (<1>

2)112  = 56°.  For  the  subsequent  analysis  it  is 
important  whether  cos$  is  significantly  larger  than  zero  as  compared  with 

unity,  and  we  get  cos<P  = 0.65. 

We  now  proceed  to  establish  the  average  transverse  momentum  per  nucleon 

in  the  reaction  plane  as  a  function  of  rapidity  px/a(y).  We  start  with  what 

might  seem  most  natural  [8],  rotating  events  to  a  common  reaction  plane,  for 

each  event  from  Q,  and  evaluating  the  in-plane  averages  px

/a(y).  The  results 

are  shown  in  fig.  2a.  Since  momenta  are  not  projected  on  the  true  reaction 

-

plane,  but  on  an  estimated  one,  we  put  a  prime  on  x. 

In  fig.  2b  we  show 

results  from  the  same  procedure  with  the  Monte-Carlo  events  that  lack  a  dynamic 

effect  in  the  reaction  plane.  The  figures  look  similar  because  of  the 

5 

finite-multiplicity  fluctuations  [8].  Let  us  examine  the  distortion  of  momenta 

in  fig.  2,  exhibited  in  the  apparent  collective  effect  for  Monte-Carlo  events. 

As  we  project  momenta  on  the  reaction  plane  from  Q,  we  evaluate

( 8) 

Here  M stands  for  the  number  of  particles  contributing  to  Q,  and  we  insert  into 

(8)  values  appriopriate  for  the  reaction.  The  distortion  (-1//M)  occurs 

because  we  project  a  particle  momentum  on  itself.  This  is  more  general,  and 

the  distortion  would  occur  if  the  reaction  plane  were  estimated  from  sphericity 

matrix  [2,8].  Once  we  relate  a  particle  to  a  construct  in  which  a  particle  has 

been  used,  we  probe  a  correlation  of  a  particle  with  itself. 

To  remove  the  distortion  of  momenta,  we  determine  the  reaction  plane  for 

each  particle  separate.ly  from  the  remaining  particles  in  an  event

The  reevaluated  p 

x' 

/a(y)  are  shown  in  figs.  3a,b,  for  data  and  Monte-Carlo 

events,  respectively,  and  the  distinction  is  now  clear.  Figs.  3c,d,  show  the 

average  differential,  per  unit  rapidity,  transverse  momentum  deposition  in  the 

estimated  reaction  plane,  dPx• /dy,  in  terms  of  nuclear  charges.  The  variable, 

integrated  over  a  rapidity  interval,  measures  total  transverse  momentum 

deposited  in  nuclear  charges  in  an  interval.  As  the  particle  momenta  are  not 

projected  onto  the  true  reaction  plane,  the  average  momenta  get  reduced: 

6 

-. px  (y)  = px(y)  • cos$,  where  '  is  the  azimuthal  angle  deviation  of  the  estimated 

plane  from  the  true  one.  Normalizing  momenta  with  the  total  observed  momentum 
(5),  l.h.s.  scales  in  figs.  3a,c,  we  find  Qx  /Qx  = cosf  =  0.64  = 0.06,  in  an 
agreement  with  the  simulated  distribution  of  Q in  fig.  la.

With  the  result  (6)  and  fig.  3c,  we  estimate  total  transverse  momentum 

transfer  between  hemispheres  (y  S  y8/2)  in  terms  of  nuclear  charges  of  p,  d,  t 
from  the  reaction,  at  2.3  = 0.2  GeV/c.  Assuming  a  corresponding  amount  of 
transfer  in  neutrons,  would  bring  the  total  transfer  in  the  reaction  to 

~4.9 GeV/c.  Here  we  comment  on  Coulomb  effects.  An  estimate,  from 

eq.  (13.1)  of  ref".  [9],  shows  that  Coulomb  repulsion  cannot  contribute  to  the 

reaction-plane  transverse-momenta  of  forward- and  backward-going  nuclear 

;

fragments,  more  than  -10  MeV/c  per  particle.  For  pions  we  find  from  data  at 
IY  - Ycl  >  6  :  oopx_.  =  12  = 8  MeV/c,  and  oop~  = 4 = 8  MeV/c.  A comparison 
(later)  with  the  cascade  model,  excluding  shadowing,  singles  out  the

decompression  of  excited  nuclear  matter  as  responsible  for  the  observed 

collective  motion  in  the  reaction  plane.  Compared  with  general  features  of  the 

reaction,  the  effect  is  moderate.  Thus,  cf.  (4),  r.m.s.  transverse  momenta  are 
(p12 ta) 112 = 525  MeV/c,  and  in  one  transverse  direction  (1/v"2)(p12 ta) 112 
= 370  MeV/c.  Further,  the  particle  distribution  is  much  elongated  in  the  beam 
direction,  as  will  be  emphasized  by  the  variables  from  sphericity  matrix,  that 

we  proceed  to  compute. 

The  vector  s1z  = ~  p1p2 /(2m  )  is  of  the  form  (1),  and  may  be  subjected  to

the  moment  analysis  as  Q in  eqs.  (2-5).  Accordingly,  we  estimate  a  crucial

Further,  we  evaluate  the  matrix  elements  s

zz  X"'X'  y'y' 

latter  two  into  sxx  and  sYY. 

In  an  analogy  with  px(y),  the  transformation  now 

involves  cos 2 ~,  that  we  estimate  from  simulated  distribution  in  fig.  la.  Upon 
diagonalization  ~ = diag(f1,f2,f3),  we  find  for  the  flow  angle  e  = 10.2  = 0.5°, 
and  for  the  eigenvalue  ratios  r 31  = f 3/f 1  = 3.35  = 0.14,  r 32  = 3.09  = 0.12,  and 
r 21  = 1.09  = 0.08.  The  index  2  is  affixed  here  to  the  axis  out  of  the  reaction 
plane,  and  indices  1  and  3  to  the  axes  shorter  and  longer  in  the  reaction 

plane,  respectively. 

We  now  confront  the  findings  with  the  theoretic  models.  From  fig.  4  of 

ref.  [7],  with  the  result  of  40ca+40ca(0.4  GeV/nucl)  at  b = 2 fm 
ideal-fluid  [4]  calculation,  we  read  off  transverse  momenta  per  nucleon  in  the 

forward  and  backward  rapidity  regions  oopx/a  - 200  MeV/c.  With  the  hydrodynamic 

scaling  [10]  this  would  correspond  to  oopx/a  - 400  MeV/c  at  Elab  = 1.8  GeV/nucl. 

Though  particle  production  should  soften  the  rise  of  momenta  with  energy,  it  is 

clear  that  the  momenta  from  fluid  dynamics  at  1.8  GeV/nucl  would  exceed  few 

times  those  observed  experimentally.  For  the  eigenvalue  ratio  and  flow  angle 

that  are  geometric  and  thus  scaling  invariant,  the  fluid  dynamic  model  yields 
at  relevant  impact  parameters  [7],  r31  = (2  - 4)  and  e  = (30  - 60) 0
angle  in  large  excess  to  that  observed  experimentally.

D 

Carrying  calculations  of  the  Ar+KCl(l.8  GeV/nucl)  reaction  at  b <  2.4  fm, 

with  the  Cugnon  [3]  intranuclear  code,  we  find  for  the  nucleon  momenta  in  the 
reaction  plane  oopx  = 22  = 2 MeV/c,  at  IY  - y8/21  > 0.3.  The  average  total 
transverse  momentum  of  protons  in  the  forward  hemisphere  is  P~ = 
0.23  = 0.06  GeV/c,  and  the  flow  parameters  are  e  =  2.6  ,  r 31  = 3.7,  and 

0 

8 

~x 

r32  =  3.7,  and  r 21  = 1.0.  Since  there  may  be  some  uncertainty  in  the  impact 
parameters  of  the  data,  we  quote  also  cascade  results  at  fixed  b = 3  fm: 
wp  = 32  = 3  MeV/c,  Pf  = 0.27  = 0.05  GeV/c,  e  =  3.2  , ·r31  = 4.6,  r 32  =  4.6, 
r 21  =  1.0.  We  conclude  that  the  cascade  model  underestimates  transverse 
momenta  of  the  data  by  a  factor  of  the  order  of  four.  The  sampling 

x 

o 

distribution,as  in  fig.  la,  is  nearly  flat  for  the  cascade  model.  Estimating 

with  (4)  we  are  able  to  detect  the  minute  momenta  in  the  reaction  plane, 
getting  wpx  = 28  = 7 MeV/c,  and  wpx  = 31  = 9  MeV/c,  at  b <  2.4  fm,  and 
b = 3  fm,  respectively.  For  sxz,  we  estimate  with  (10),  sxz  = 9 = 2 MeV,  and 
sxz  = 10  = 3 MeV,  while  elements  evaluated  with  the  known  reaction  plane  are 
sxz  = 8 = 1 MeV,  and  sxz  = 12  = 1  Mev,  respectively. 

The  current  results  do  not  include  corrections  for  the  overall  transverse 

momentum  conservation.  The  corrections  may  be  important  when  the  moment 

analysis  (3,4,10)  is  separately  applied  to  the  forward  or  backward  hemispheres, 

for  weaker  dynamic  effects  than  in  the  data. 

To  conclude,  we  have  successfully  isolated  the  collective  motion  effects 

in  the  transverse  momenta  from  the  Ar+KCl(l.8  GeV/nucl)  reaction.  The  apparent 

ease  with  which  one  gets  a  handle  on  the  motion  with  the  new  method  of 

analysis,  stems  from  the  fact  that  the  method  explores  the  2-particle 

correlation  induced  by  existence  of  the  reaction  plane,  amplified  by 

summation  over  many  particles.  By  contrast  the  standard  sphericity  method 

explores  the  single-particle  [8]  aspect  of  many  particle  distribution 

associated  with  the  reaction  plane.

Fig.  1.  Azimuthal  angle  distribution  of  vectors  ~I  and  ~II  from  subevents  with 

respect  to  each  other:  {a)  for  data,  {b)  for  Monte-Carlo  events. 

Dashed  line  is  for  the  simulation  with  two  Gaussian  sources.  Solid 

line  represents  azimuthal  angle  distribution  of  vector  Q from  the 

sources  with  respect  to  the  reaction  plane  {this  is  normalized  to  the 

height  with  the  sampling  distribution). 

Fig.  2.  Average  in-plane  transverse  momentum  per  nucleon  as  a  function  of 

rapidity,  from  rotation  of  events  to  the  reaction  plane  determined 

by  Q:  {a)  for  data,  (b)  for  Monte-Carlo  events. 

Fig.  3.  {a,b)  Average  momentum  per  nucleon  in  the  estimated  reaction  plane 

px' /a(y),  upon  removal  of  finite-multiplicity  distortions,  for  data 

and  Monte-Carlo  events,  respectively.  {c,d)  Differential,  per  unit 

rapidity,  transverse  momentum  deposition  in  the  estimated  reaction 

plane  in  terms  of  nuclear  charges  dP 

/dy,  for  data  and  Monte-Carlo 

x' 

events,  respectively.  L.h.s.  scales  in  (a)  and  {c)  yield  respective 

estimated  average  momenta  per  nucleon  px/a{y),  and  deposition  dPx/dy, 

in  the  true  reaction  plane.
