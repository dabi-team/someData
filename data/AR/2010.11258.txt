Abstract: We report on the preparation of and calibration measurements with a 83mKr source for
the CENNS-10 liquid argon detector. 83mKr atoms generated in the decay of a 83Rb source were
introduced into the detector via injection into the Ar circulation loop. Scintillation light arising
from the 9.4 keV and 32.1 keV conversion electrons in the decay of 83mKr in the detector volume
were then observed. This calibration source allows the characterization of the low-energy response
of the CENNS-10 detector and is applicable to other low-energy-threshold detectors. The energy
resolution of the detector was measured to be 9% at the total 83mKr decay energy of 41.5 keV.
We performed an analysis to separately calibrate the detector using the two conversion electrons at
9.4 keV and 32.1 keV.

Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) was proposed in 1974 [1, 2] following the
discovery of the weak neutral current [3]. In CEvNS, the wavelength of the momentum transfer
between the neutrino and the scattering nucleus is larger than the size of the nucleus. This results
in a coherent enhancement to the CEvNS cross section but restricts the process to relatively low-
energy neutrinos O (10 MeV) for an argon nucleus. As the nucleus elastically scatters, the only
detectable signature is a low-energy O (10 keV) nuclear recoil. The Standard Model provides a
precise prediction of the CEvNS cross-section and any deviations from the prediction could be
indicative of physics beyond the Standard Model. CEvNS also provides an opportunity for many
interesting physics searches [4, 5].

CEvNS remained undetected until the COHERENT collaboration ﬁrst observed the interaction
with a 14.6-kg CsI[Na] crystal in 2017 [6]. A primary goal of COHERENT is to measure the
characteristic dependence of the CEvNS cross section on the number of neutrons squared (𝑁 2) [7].
To that end, the 24-kg (active), single-phase, liquid argon detector, CENNS-10, was deployed in
the low-background “Neutrino Alley” at the Spallation Neutron Source at the US Department of
Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in late 2016. CENNS-10 provides a relatively
light target nucleus to begin measuring the 𝑁 2 dependence of the CEvNS cross section. An initial
engineering run made measurements of the neutron backgrounds associated with the Spallation

Neutron Source beam-on-target and placed a limit on the CEvNS cross section [8]. COHERENT
produced the world’s-ﬁrst measurement of CEvNS on argon using ﬁrst data from CENNS-10 [4, 5].
CEvNS events in liquid argon lie in a range of 5 to 40 keVee, where keVee indicates the recon-
structed electron equivalent energy. Thus, CEvNS detection with CENNS-10 required a precise
characterization of the low-energy detector response. To that end, we prepared and introduced an in
situ 83mKr internal calibration source to allow for a detailed understanding of the detector response
near the CEvNS energy region of interest.

83mKr is generated through the decay of 83Rb via electron capture (𝑡1/2 = 86.2 d). The decay
of 83Rb produces gamma rays with a range of energies, the most abundant being roughly 500 keV.
These gamma rays can be used to monitor the 83mKr production rate of the source (see Section 3).
Approximately 75% of 83Rb decays produce a metastable state of 83Kr, 83mKr.
83mKr has an
excitation energy of 41.5 keV [9] (Figure 1) and decays to the ground state of 83Kr via internal
transition emitting two conversion electrons. The ﬁrst is emitted with energy 32.1 keV and the
second is emitted with a half-life of 157 ns and later with energy 9.4 keV.

83mKr has been used as a low-energy calibration source in noble liquid detectors [10–13]
typically used for direct detection of dark matter, and by experiments designed to directly measure
the neutrino mass [14, 15]. In the case of direct detection of dark matter, the low-energy nuclear
recoil is the same detection signature as CEvNS, making 83mKr a natural choice for the low-energy
characterization of CENNS-10.

We prepared a 83mKr source and successfully injected it into CENNS-10. The introduction
of this source calibrates the detector electron recoil response to ∼ 2% at the 41.5 keV full energy
deposition of 83mKr. Using the light yield from the separate components of the 83mKr decay, CO-
HERENT calibrated the CENNS-10 detector down to 9.4 keV. This calibration procedure provided

of the source, the calibration of CENNS-10 using 83mKr, the measurement of the source activity
using nondestructive radioassay techniques, and the stability of the 83mKr calibration system.

2 Preparation of 83mKr source

A 0.1 M HCl aqueous solution with a total volume of 1.65 mL contained the 83Rb with an initial
activity of 1 mCi. We acquired the 83Rb solution through the Isotope Business Oﬃce at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory [16]. We required that the 83Rb be infused into a matrix that will
adsorb the 83Rb but release the 83mKr gas atoms to admix with the circulating argon boil-oﬀ gas
from CENNS-10. Other liquid-noble-detector applications of 83mKr sources have successfully used
zeolite [13, 17] and activated carbon matrices [18]. We chose OVC 4x8 activated carbon produced
by Calgon Carbon Corporation because of the low radon concentration in activated carbon compared
with a zeolite matrix.

The 83mKr source preparation procedure broadly followed one used by DarkSide, an experiment
to search for dark matter using a liquid argon detector [19, 20]. A similar device to the one described
in this paper was designed at Yale University [18] and used in the LUX experiment [12] with a
replica produced for use in the SCENE experiment [21]. Prior to deposition of the 83Rb solution,
the activated carbon was baked in a vacuum oven overnight to remove volatile impurities present in
the carbon.

The 83Rb solution was deposited onto the carbon using a 10 µL syringe. At the time of the
source deposition in April 2018, the 10 ± 5 µL deposition volume of the syringe used produced a
3.9 ± 1.9 µCi or 140 ± 70 kBq 83Rb source. A period of 55 days elapsed between the calibration of
the 83Rb solution to 1 mCi and the source deposition. Given the large uncertainty in the eﬃciency
of the 83mKr atoms to reach the detector volume, we created a high-activity source to ensure that
suﬃcient 83mKr atoms would reach it. The 83Rb activity could not be measured via the exact
deposition volume at the time of deposition nor the solution transferred to a diﬀerent container
in order to minimize worker exposure to 83Rb. The available equipment and methods to create
the 83Rb source only allowed for a ±50% measurement on the deposition volume; this uncertainty
was found from tests using water in place of the 83Rb solution. Therefore, an in situ measurement
of the activity was later performed (Section 3). Note that if the same 83Rb solution is reused for
another deposition the puncture of the bottle with the syringe during the initial deposition causes
evaporation of the solution over time.

A Swagelok Vacuum Coupling Radiation (VCR)–based apparatus held the 83Rb-infused car-
bon. A 1/2 in. VCR tee held the carbon, which sat inside a structure consisting of stainless steel
mesh and ﬁne quartz wool to keep the 83Rb-infused carbon from shifting inside the container. The
introduction of any 83Rb into the liquid argon volume would generate a long-lived 𝛾-ray background
during normal detector operations. This background is prevented using two 2 µm sintered metal
ﬁlters on either end of the VCR tee to keep the carbon particulates from entering the detector
volume.

After deposition, the VCR tee directly holding the 83Rb-infused charcoal was sealed but the
system remained open through the sections immediately after the ﬁlters shown later in Figure 5.
The VCR system was continuously purged with 3 psig high-purity (99.999%) gaseous argon (GAr)

– 3 –

continuously ﬂowing through the source exiting through a fume hood. During the purge procedure,
the source was heated ﬁrst for 1.5 h at 60 °C, then for 1 h at 80 °C, and ﬁnally for 1 h at 100 °C.
This procedure removed impurities and evaporates any HCl remaining from the 83Rb solution.

3 Determination of source activity

A high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector, model Canberra BE3820, was used to determine the
activity of the 83Rb source by making a direct gamma spectroscopy measurement generally used
in nondestructive assay of nuclear materials. An Inspector 2000 Digital Signal Processor and
Multichannel Analyzer was used to acquire the spectra. The Genie2000 spectroscopy software
was used as the data acquisition software for the measurement. The measured activity of the 83Rb
source was determined via

𝐴83Rb =

𝑁
𝜂(cid:48)𝜇𝑡𝑌𝛾

,

(3.1)

where 𝑁 is the total number of counts in the photopeak of interest, 𝑡 is the measurement time, 𝜂(cid:48) is
the measured detector eﬃciency before correcting for the VCR container attenuation, 𝜇 is the VCR
container attenuation factor, and 𝑌𝛾 is the branching ratio for a given 83Rb gamma ray. An hour-long
measurement (𝑡 = 3600 s) of the 83Rb source activity was performed by placing the HPGe detector
at a known distance away from the 83Rb source as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Location of the HPGe detector for the source activity measurement. The detector was placed at
a known distance from the 83Rb source, which was inside the steel VCR container shown in the picture.

To measure the detector eﬃciency and include the contribution due to container attenuation,
we created a replica of the VCR tee that held the carbon. Measurements with 57Co and 152Eu
sources with known activities established the eﬃciency curve for the detector. Measurements taken

– 4 –

with these sources both inside and outside the container were used to characterize the attenuation
at the relevant gamma energies due to the VCR source container. The data from the 57Co and 152Eu
sources are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Left: Data from the 57Co calibration used for the activity measurement. A run length of 300 s
was taken with a source with an activity of 27.71 kBq at the time of the measurement. Right: Data from
the 152Eu calibration for the activity measurement. A run length of 900 s was taken with a source with an
activity of 193 kBq on May 15, 2010

Uncertainties in the detector eﬃciency include those on the attenuation from the container, the
measured eﬃciency curve, and the activity of the sources used. In total, these uncertainties produce
a ∼ 1% error on the ﬁnal measured activity of the 83Rb source. The uncertainty in the exact position
of the 83Rb-infused carbon is the major uncertainty on the container attenuation factor. The carbon
position uncertainty can be reduced by moving the detector further away from the source although
that was not done during this measurement. The absolute activity of the 83Rb source was computed
using Eq. (3.1) after the detector eﬃciency was determined. Results are shown in Table 1.

in agreement with the expected value of 10 ± 5 kBq accounting for the decay of the 83Rb over the
323 days from the initial deposition to the date of the measurement using the HPGe detector.

4.1 The CENNS-10 detector

CENNS-10 is a single-phase scintillation-only liquid argon detector originally designed and built at
Fermilab for a CEvNS program [22]. CENNS-10 was installed at the Spallation Neutron Source as
part of COHERENT to measure CEvNS in late 2016. Following the engineering run in the spring
of 2017 [8], CENNS-10 was upgraded to improve the light collection and to increase radiation
shielding. Following the upgrade, the detector resumed data-taking for production running in the
fall of 2017. The CENNS-10 detector system as conﬁgured for production running is shown in
Figure 4.

In CENNS-10, the main detector volume is thermally isolated by an insulating vacuum and
is suspended from three stainless steel turnbuckles attached to the vacuum vessel lid. During
production running, a cylinder (𝑟 = 20.95 cm, ℎ = 60.96 cm) evaporatively coated with 1,1,4,4-
tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene (TPB) deﬁnes the 24 kg active detection region. TPB is a high-eﬃciency
wavelength shifter [23, 24] that converts the 128 nm liquid argon scintillation light to the visible
(𝜆peak ∼ 400 nm) where it is more eﬃciently coupled to the photomultiplier tube (PMT) photocath-
ode response. TPB-coated PTFE (Teﬂon) reﬂecting panels prepared in-house at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory deﬁne the side walls of the cylinder. Two frosted-glass Hamamatsu R5912-02MOD
cryogenic PMTs evaporatively coated with TPB by Intlvac [25] were immersed in the liquid argon
and provide coverage for detection over the cylinder faces. The coating thickness was optimized for
maximal light detection to an areal density of 0.2 mg/cm2 [26, 27]. The PMT signals were recorded
by a 12 bit, 250 MHz digitizer.

The liquid argon scintillation mechanism is well understood. Energy depositions in liquid
argon cause the formation of excited dimer states, which produce 128 nm scintillation light during
de-excitation. These excimers can form into a singlet (𝜏1/2 ∼ 6 ns) or a triplet (𝜏1/2 ∼ 1.6 µs) state,
with some indication of an intermediate lifetime [28]. The light output of liquid argon strongly
depends on the argon purity [29, 30]. Therefore, the argon in the CENNS-10 system was circulated
through a Zr getter to ensure the purity requirements (O (1 ppm) N2 contamination) for scintillation
light are met.

This puriﬁed gas was then reliqueﬁed in a condenser located above the detector volume,
completing the circulation loop. A Cryomech CP-950 powered a PT-90 cold head to liquefy the
GAr, which was precooled after passing through a heat exchanger with the detector boil-oﬀ gas.

The CENNS-10 shielding structure was designed to minimize the eﬀects of gamma ray and
neutron backgrounds for a CEvNS search and is shown in Figure 4. The outermost shielding element
consists of 10.16 cm of chevroned lead bricks. Inside the lead is 1.27 cm of copper to minimize
background from bremsstrahlung radiation due to 210Pb decays. Finally, the innermost shielding
element consists of 23 cm of water to minimize backgrounds from external neutron sources.

4.2 Modes of operation

The 83mKr calibration system was designed to be able to operate in either “injection” or “circulation”
mode depending on the position of valves located throughout the system. Figure 5 shows the
plumbing diagram, including valves associated with the introduction of the 83mKr source. All

– 6 –

Figure 4. CENNS-10 detector system. The 24 kg ﬁducial volume is read out by two Hamamatsu R5912-
02MOD PMTs. The shielding structure is designed to minimize backgrounds for a CEvNS search [6, 7].

valves shown were open to operate in injection mode with the exception of those leading to
the vacuum pump and the circulation inlet. In injection mode operation, the 83mKr atoms were
introduced into the system with a one-time injection. After evacuating the 83mKr source with a
turbomolecular pump, 83mKr gas was allowed to accumulate. The initial evacuation of the system
was optional but was used as a method to control the resulting rate of 83mKr decays that depend
on the length of the accumulation time after evacuating. The 83mKr was then introduced into the
system by ﬂowing 99.999 % argon gas from a ultrahigh-purity bottle through the source and into
the CENNS-10 circulation loop.

In circulation mode, the 83mKr system was directly introduced into the CENNS-10 GAr circu-
lation loop to allow a constant ﬂow of argon to pass through the 83mKr system and the charcoal.
This allowed for the rate of 83mKr decays seen in the detector to reach a steady-state value dependent
on the activity of the 83Rb source. Although the design allows for operation in circulation mode,
this bypasses a ﬂow meter that ﬁnely controls the ﬂow rate of the recirculating GAr and introduces
instability of CENNS-10 detector operations. Therefore, this mode was not used for calibration.
Future improvements to the system for circulation mode operation will stabilize the 83mKr concen-
tration in CENNS-10 and better inform the 83mKr transport eﬃciency into the active volume. The

detector.

Figure 5. CENNS-10 83mKr source plumbing diagram. The source attaches directly to the CENNS-10
gas-handling system. If necessary, the source can be bypassed to ﬂow GAr directly into the detector. The
83mKr source is contained in a 1/2 in. VCR cap and tee holding the 83Rb-infused carbon.

The design of the 83mKr source apparatus allowed for GAr to ﬂow through or bypass the 83Rb-
infused carbon vessel on its path into the CENNS-10 detector. The apparatus was also connected to
a turbomolecular pump and could be evacuated to check for vacuum leaks. The normal recirculation
path of the boil-oﬀ GAr from the CENNS-10 volume carried the 83mKr atoms through the CENNS-
10 gas handling system, the liqueﬁer, and into the active volume. A diagram of the location of the
source inside the VCR tee attached to the CENNS-10 gas-handling system is shown in Figure 6.

4.3 Tests prior to injection

Before introducing the 83mKr-activated carbon, we performed tests of the apparatus in injection and
circulation modes by attaching the VCR tee to the CENNS-10 gas-handling system. The two tests
included the VCR tee system both with and without clean carbon inside. These tests using a 57Co
calibration source showed that no degradation of the detector light collection eﬃciency occurred
and no additional impurities were introduced from adding GAr in injection mode. The injection
mode allowed the detector to remain operational where the recirculation rate is ﬁnely controlled
and the recirculating gas passes through the Zr getter. We ﬁrst observed the gas-system instability
associated with circulation mode operation during these tests.

We performed several runs in April 2018 to August 2019 using the 83mKr calibration system
described in Section 2, usually during normal Spallation Neutron Source shutdown periods. The
continued runs over a lengthy period demonstrate the capability to repeatedly calibrate the CENNS-
10 detector with a single 83mKr source.

quartz wool holds the carbon in place within the tee. Right: 83mKr source attached to the CENNS-10
gas-handling system in operation mode focused on the VCR tee holding the carbon and surrounding parts.
The VCR tee is the section in the center on the right side of the source.

For the initial runs, we evacuated the 83mKr source using the turbomolecular pump to remove
the built-up 83mKr gas during the period between runs. After the evacuation, we allowed the 83mKr
gas to accumulate over a period of approximately 2 h. To achieve the maximal rate during an
injection due to the reduced source activity in later runs, the source region was not evacuated before
the injection of 83mKr.

4.4 Calibration of the CENNS-10 detector with 83mKr

For the 83mKr calibration, the CENNS-10 data acquisition was triggered by the coincidence of two
PMT signals above a voltage threshold within a 24 ns window. The set threshold was above the
single photoelectron (SPE) pulse height in the PMTs to prevent random coincidences. A pulsed
LED calibration measured the approximate height of the SPE pulses.

The digitized waveforms were recorded for a range of −1.5 µs < 𝑡trig < 6 µs where 𝑡trig is
the time of the waveform trigger, which is the initial pulse. The waveforms were corrected for
known capacitive coupling eﬀects and pulses were identiﬁed from the corrected waveforms using
a voltage-level threshold. PMT waveforms are further required to have a stable baseline and no
ADC saturation. The total number of photoelectrons (PEs), 𝐼, was extracted from the corrected
waveform in a 6 µs window after the initial pulse near 𝑡trig = 0. For 83mKr data, this choice of
integration window combines the two depositions into a calibration measurement at 41.5 keV. The
long lifetime of the triplet state of liquid argon scintillation drove the choice of integration window.
Candidate events were then formed by requiring pulses with ≥ 2 PE in both PMTs occurring within
20 ns of each other. An example 83mKr event waveform is shown in Figure 7.

The 83mKr source produced a clear peak in the energy spectrum above the steady-state back-
grounds seen in the detector, which corresponds to the full 41.5 keV energy deposition. Background
spectra were taken during these runs before the introduction of 83mKr to allow for a background
subtraction of the 83mKr data. After a background subtraction was performed, the resulting 83mKr
peak at 41.5 keV was ﬁt to a Gaussian distribution and the energy resolution was measured to be
9.3% at 41.5 keV, or approximately 1.3√
𝑁 where 𝑁 is the number of measured PEs. We measured the

energy mean uncertainty to ∼ 2%, combining errors on the integrated SPE, the spread of calibration
results in the PE space, and the Gaussian ﬁt model for the 83mKr calibration source.

Figure 8 shows an example reconstructed energy spectrum in units of PEs from one of the
83mKr source runs. The exact location of the 83mKr event peak in this plot depends on the deﬁnition
of the SPE used within an analysis. Two parallel analyses of the CENNS-10 data, labeled “Analysis
A” and “Analysis B” and described further in Ref. [4], choose diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the integrated
SPE resulting in diﬀerent values for the light yield, 𝑌 , of the detector. There is one key diﬀerence
in the determination of the value of the integrated SPE. Analysis A adopts a model where the
integrated SPE is extracted from the fully ampliﬁed SPE component with the ﬁt function described
further in Ref. [31] ﬁtting to LED calibration data. Analysis B adopted a single Gaussian model
to describe the integrated SPE ﬁtting the late triplet light from source calibration data within a
small window. The two analyses independently measured a very similar mean energy uncertainty
and therefore, this choice only minimally aﬀects the full reconstruction from digitized waveform to
reconstructed energy.

External 241Am and 57Co sources along with this 83mKr source established the linearity of the
CENNS-10 detector response in the range of 41.5–122 keV. As seen in the right panel of Figure 8,
a linear detector response and a light yield of 𝑌 = 4.3 ± 0.1 PE/keV was observed from Analysis
A and 𝑌 = 4.9 ± 0.1 PE/keV from Analysis B. The diﬀerence in the measured values is almost
exclusively due to the diﬀerent deﬁnition of the SPE. The important result is that both analyses
measure a linear detector response using the same set of source measurements. The value of the
location in PEs of the 83mKr peak used in Figure 8 is an average of the various runs performed using
the 83mKr source.

Figure 9 shows the 83mKr event rate as a function of time during an injection mode run. Data
were taken with the 83mKr source for a period of time after the injection occurred until the event
rates returned to steady-state background levels. Observing the time-evolution of the 83mKr event
rate during the injection mode run, we found a best-ﬁt half-life of 1.82 ± 0.01 h, in agreement with
the reported half-life of 1.83 h in [9].

The right sub-ﬁgure in Figure 9 shows the distribution of 83mKr events throughout the detector

volume by examining the fraction of total light seen by the top PMT, 𝑓top, deﬁned as

𝑓top =

𝐼top
𝐼

,

(4.1)

where 𝐼top is the integrated signal for the top PMT and 𝐼 is the total integrated signal from the top and
bottom PMTs. Examination of the time dependence of this parameter shows a clear concentration
of higher 𝑓top values at the beginning of the run before a uniform distribution in the CENNS-10
detector volume occurs. This indicates that the 83mKr source events are more concentrated toward
the top PMT when the 83mKr gas is ﬁrst introduced into the system but evenly distributed throughout
the detector volume at later times.

During a run in which the measured rate was allowed to reach the maximal value, the observed
83mKr rate of 2.6 kBq was 68% of the expected rate of 3.8 kBq at the time of the run. The expected
rate was determined from the measurement in Section 3, accounting for the ﬁducial volume of the
detector and the branching ratio of 83Rb decays that produce 83mKr (Figure 1). Although the exact
reason for the discrepancy in the measured rate compared with the expected rate is unknown, one
possibility is the unaccounted freeze-out of 83mKr atoms on detector surfaces. This fraction of
detected events still ensures a signiﬁcant number of 83mKr decays in the CENNS-10 volume over
the course of a single run.

4.5 Component isolation analysis

As the total energy deposition for a given 83mKr decay is composed of two components at energies of
9.4 keV and 32.1 keV, one can obtain separate calibrations at each energy. In each decay of 83mKr, a
prompt electron from the 32.1 keV transition is followed by the electron from the 9.4 keV transition

with a half-life of 157 ns. In practice, the average light yield of these depositions is diﬃcult to
determine through standard integral analysis methods because of the large degree of overlap in the
scintillation light arising from the triplet state. Two separate analyses were performed to extract
the light yield from each component of the 83mKr decay using the methods of both Analysis A and
Analysis B from Ref. [4].

4.5.1 Analysis A

The ﬁrst method uses the waveform analysis techniques of Analysis A described further in Ref. [4],
which directly integrates the event waveform. For any given 83mKr calibration data set, a population
of events with a delayed (> 90 ns) 9.4 keV energy deposition exists. This population is readily
apparent in the data when comparing the integrals of the recorded waveforms at two distinct time
intervals (Figure 10).

If the energy depositions are suﬃciently separated in time, then it is possible to perform an
independent measurement of the light yield using distributions of the respective singlet peak heights.
Using a large sample of background 39Ar beta-decay events, one can construct an energy-dependent
relationship for the ratio of the singlet peak amplitude in ADC units to the total PE collected for
electron recoil events in the CENNS-10 detector (Figure 11). The light yield 𝑌 for a given energy
deposit 𝐸dep is related to the peak amplitude 𝐴 𝑝 via

𝐸dep · 𝑌 =

𝐴 𝑝
𝑆 𝐴 𝑝

,

(4.2)

where 𝑆 𝐴 𝑝 is a function that varies with the value of 𝑌 · 𝐸dep that returns the nominal value of the
peak-to-integral ratio for the total expected PE of that event. Given the measured 𝑆 𝐴 𝑝 for each 𝐴 𝑝,
we can solve Eq. 4.2 implicitly for 𝑌 .

To measure the mean peak amplitude for 32.1 keV depositions, we selected events with the
9.4 keV component delayed by at least 152 ns (preventing any contribution to the initial event peak).
A Gaussian ﬁt was then applied to the distribution of the largest amplitude sample in the added
waveform of the top and bottom PMTs. The expected total number of PEs for the deposition can
then be solved for using the aforementioned peak-to-integral ratio function Eq. (4.2).

The peak height for 9.4 keV depositions was obtained through a peak-ﬁnding analysis of the
summed PMT waveforms. After a delay of 152 ns with respect to event onset, the sample at which
the largest amplitude occurs is selected as the “delayed peak” for that event. The peak information
was limited to a single sample in this analysis to reduce the potential inﬂuence of triplet scintillation
photons from the preceding 32.1 keV deposition. Examination of the timing distribution of these

applied to background 39Ar data to build the underlying background distribution. Finally, the
distribution of 9.4 keV peak heights was modelled by a normal distribution featuring an exponential
tail. This model was combined with the 39Ar background distribution and a ﬁt was performed on
the 83mKr calibration data (shown in Figure 13), yielding a most probable peak height value of
158.5 ± 1.4 ADC units. This value was used in conjunction with Eq. (4.2) to infer the light yield at
9.4 keV. Results from this method and the full integration method are shown in Table 2.

4.5.2 Analysis B

We also performed an alternative and complementary analysis that computed the light yield from
the two 83mKr decay components using the methods from Analysis B further described in Ref. [4].
This analysis used the information contained in the ﬁrst 90 ns of an event, mainly the singlet light
from the argon scintillation for both the 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV components, to infer the full detector-
photon yield from these components. The two types of events considered were those with only the
singlet light from the 32.1 keV present in the ﬁrst 90 ns and those that contain the singlet light from
the full 41.5 keV. The position in time in the waveform of the second peak as shown in Figure 7
distinguishes these classes of events. This is in contrast to the analysis described in Section 4.5.1,
which searched for the singlet light from the 9.4 keV events outside of the 90 ns singlet decay using
the position of this pulse in the waveform.

Within this analysis, a time range of 0 to 55 ns selected events in which the singlet light from
the 9.4 keV component was contained largely within the 90 ns with small losses of < 1% in pulse
integral. A toy Monte Carlo (MC) was performed to generate events in which the singlet light from
the 9.4 keV component appeared a set time after the 32.1 keV component. Using the generated
events from the MC, two parameters 𝐼35 and 𝐼55 were computed where 𝐼35(55) is the integral in the
ﬁrst 35(55) ns of the waveform. The MC generated events with various time diﬀerences between
the two components to study the behavior of 𝐼35:𝐼55 in diﬀerent populations. An example of this
parameter space is shown in Figure 14. The toy MC allows for an understanding of where these
events will lie along a line by examining the two parameters based on the time at which the 9.4 keV
component appears. If the singlet light from the 9.4 keV component occurs within the time range
between 35 and 55 ns, then 𝐼35 ≠ 𝐼55. Events in the CENNS-10 data can then be chosen in which
the value lies below the 𝐼35 (cid:39) 𝐼55 line in the 𝐼35:𝐼55 parameter space in Figure 14.

The same distribution of 𝐼35 and 𝐼55 values was found in the CENNS-10 83mKr calibration
data. The left panel of Figure 15 shows the calibration data with a population where 𝐼35 (cid:39) 𝐼55 with
some events lying below that line. The events below this line represent those in which the 9.4 keV
component occurred between 35 and 55 ns after the 32.1 keV component and are the events of

interest in this analysis. The data were projected onto an axis that represented a rotation of the 𝐼35
and 𝐼55 axes, which is shown in the right panel of Figure 15. The coordinate value on the rotated
axis is given by

rotated axis = 𝐼35cos(𝛼) − 𝐼55sin(𝛼).

A linear ﬁt to the proﬁle of the left panel of Figure 15 along the 𝐼55 axis gives 𝛼 = 37.5◦ from
the slope of the line. The two Gaussians represent events containing only the 32.1 keV component
and both components, respectively. The vertical line represents a cut in the rotated axis, which
suppresses the number of events with only the 32.1 keV component by a factor of 103.

Additionally, a cut was made on the value of 𝐹90 =

𝐼90
𝐼 , the fraction of the total integral of
the waveform in the ﬁrst 90 ns. An 𝐹90 cut selected 83mKr electron recoil events. 𝐼90 represents
the integrated signal in PEs in the ﬁrst 90 ns of the waveform and 𝐼 represents the total integrated
signal in PEs over the entire time window. The optimal cut was derived from the 57Co data, which
also represent electron recoils but do not have a large probability of multiple recoils occurring in
a single event window. A cut on 𝑓𝑡𝑜 𝑝 was made to reduce edge eﬀects when computing the light
yield.

The selected data were ﬁt with two Gaussians making selecting events to the left of the cut
shown in Figure 15 for the 32.1 keV events and to the right of the cut shown in Figure 15 for the
events with both components present. The best-ﬁt value of each Gaussian represents 𝐼90 for events
with only the 32.1 keV component present in the ﬁrst 90 ns, and events with both components
present in the ﬁrst 90 ns. Subtracting the value of 𝐼90 for the 32.1 keV energy deposition from the

the waveform, and the 𝐹90 parameters represent the values of 𝐹90 extracted from the 57Co data at the

4.5.3 Summary

The two analyses described in this section agree that the CENNS-10 detector response was linear
in the range 9.4 to 122 keV. The two methods were complementary, applying diﬀerent techniques
to extract the light yield for the two 83mKr components, and came to the same conclusion that
detector response is linear. The results from Table 2 for Analysis A and Table 4 for Analysis B are
in agreement with a linear detector response when combined with the previous calibration results
from Figure 8. This is shown graphically in the left panel of Figure 16.

Additionally, these results agree with the recent ArgonNEST [34] release predicting linearity
of liquid argon detectors at zero applied electric ﬁeld down to 9.4 keV. A comparison of the results
described in this section with the ArgonNEST predictions is shown in the right panel of Figure 16.
Because ArgonNEST predictions use the absolute photon yield from liquid argon, the relative light
yield was computed with the CENNS-10 results scaled by the light yield values for each analysis
from the left panel of Figure 16.

5 Conclusions

A 83mKr calibration source was designed and prepared for the calibration of COHERENT’s CENNS-
10 liquid argon scintillation detector. The source was successfully integrated into the CENNS-10
gas-handling and recirculation system. A measurement of the source activity was made using
nondestructive assay techniques. The 83mKr evenly distributed within the detector ∼ 30 min after
the initial introduction of 83mKr. A comparison of the measured activity to the steady-state 83mKr
decay rate seen in CENNS-10 showed that a suﬃcient fraction of the expected 83mKr decays reached
the active volume, providing a calibration with good agreement between the measured 83mKr decay
lifetime and the expected decay lifetime. CENNS-10 operation in injection mode preserved stable
detector operations and was the optimal method for calibration with 83mKr.

isolation analyses at 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV. The two ﬁt lines correspond to the previously measured values
of 𝑌 = 4.3 ± 0.1 PE/keV from Analysis A in blue and 𝑌 = 4.9 ± 0.1 PE/keV for Analysis B in red, shown
in Figure 8. The results of these analyses agree with the linear detector response shown previously and push
the measured linearity range to 9.4–122 keV. Right: Comparison of CENNS-10 results from the two 83mKr
component separation analyses compared with the ArgonNEST predictions. The results of these analyses
agree with the prediction of detector response linearity from ArgonNEST.

The calibration runs taken with this source give conﬁdence in continued calibration of the
CENNS-10 detector with 83mKr. A signiﬁcant population of 83mKr decays appeared during a single
calibration run. Analysis of 83mKr data shows the energy response of the detector was linear to
9.4 keV. The measured energy resolution of ∼ 9% was suﬃcient for a CEvNS measurement with
CENNS-10. The measured half-life of the 83mKr decay from the calibration runs agrees well with
the expected value from the literature. Two additional independent analyses, which examine the
two transitions in the decay of 83mKr, separately calculated the light yield from each transition. The
results of the analyses agree with the recent ArgonNEST predictions of detector response linearity
in this energy range. This source gave the lowest-energy calibration available to CENNS-10 and
was close to the energy region of interest for the primary CEvNS search analysis. The results of
the 83mKr calibration bolsters our understanding of the detector at the expected energies for CEvNS
recoil measurements.
