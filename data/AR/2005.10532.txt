ABSTRACT

Magnetic ﬂux generated and intensiﬁed by the solar dynamo emerges into the solar atmosphere, forming
active regions (ARs) including sunspots. Existing theories of ﬂux emergence suggest that the magnetic ﬂux can
rise buoyantly through the convection zone but is trapped at the photosphere, while its further rising into the
atmosphere resorts to the Parker buoyancy instability. To trigger such an instability, the Lorentz force in the
photosphere needs to be as large as the gas pressure gradient to hold up an extra amount of mass against gravity.
This naturally results in a strongly non-force-free photosphere, which is indeed shown in typical idealized
numerical simulations of ﬂux tube buoyancy from below the photosphere into the corona. Here we conduct a
statistical study of the extents of normalized Lorentz forces and torques in the emerging photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld with a substantially large sample of SDO/HMI vector magnetograms. We found that the photospheric
ﬁeld has a rather small Lorentz force and torque on average, and thus is very close to a force-free state, which
is not consistent with theories as well as idealized simulations of ﬂux emergence. Furthermore, the small
extents of forces and torques seem not to be inﬂuenced by the emerging AR’s size, the emergence rate, or the
non-potentiality of the ﬁeld. This result puts an important constraint on future development of theories and
simulations of ﬂux emergence.

1. INTRODUCTION

Sunspots and solar active regions (ARs) are believed to be
generated by magnetic ﬂux emerging through the solar sur-
face, i.e., the photosphere (Parker 1955). In the ﬁrst place,
magnetic ﬁeld is generated by the solar dynamo action in
the deep convection zone. Then the magnetic ﬂuxes are fur-
ther intensiﬁed and adopt the form of ﬂux bundles because
of stretching and twisting of their magnetic ﬁeld lines by tur-
bulent ﬂuid motions in the convection zone. Eventually, the
ﬂux bundles are pushed up by magnetic buoyancy and rise
into the photosphere to form ARs.

Since we are not able to observe directly the process in
the sub-photospheric layers, most of the knowledge on ﬂux
emergence comes from theoretical models and numerical

MHD simulations (Archontis 2008; Cheung & Isobe 2014;
Archontis & Syntelis 2019). Many simulations show that,
a ﬂux tube, generally twisted, experiences a typical two-
stage emergence process (e.g., Toriumi & Yokoyama 2010)
during its passage from the convection zone into the atmo-
sphere, i.e., the solar corona.
In the ﬁrst stage, the mag-
netic buoyancy force pushes upward the ﬂux tube through
the convection zone (Parker 1955), but it is trapped at
the shallow layers near the solar surface because of the
strongly sub-adiabatic stratiﬁcation (i.e., much smaller tem-
perature gradient than an adiabatic stratiﬁcation) of the pho-
tosphere (e.g., Syntelis et al. 2019). Then in the second
stage, with more and more magnetic ﬂux pileup just below
the surface, the magnetic pressure gradient increases con-
tinuously and eventually the Parker instability (Shibata et al.
1989; Archontis et al. 2004), a kind of magnetic Rayleigh-
Taylor instability, is triggered to let part of the ﬂux break
through the dense photosphere, which is typically observed

as a continuous magnetic ﬂux increasing on the photosphere
during the emerging of an AR.

To trigger the Parker instability at the sub-adiabatic pho-
tosphere, the Lorentz force must be built up such that it can
support against gravity an extra amount of mass compara-
ble to what is supported by the photospheric gas pressure
gradient (Newcomb 1961; Acheson 1979; Archontis et al.
2004). Meanwhile the plasma β (ratio of plasma pressure
to magnetic pressure) is on the order of unity in the pho-
tosphere (Gary 2001; Cho et al. 2017). Thus, in the pho-
tosphere, the magnitude of Lorentz force should be com-
parable to that of the magnetic pressure gradient, and so
the emerging ﬁeld in the photosphere is far from a force-
free state in which the Lorentz force vanishes as a result
of the balancing between magnetic pressure force and mag-
netic tension (Wiegelmann & Sakurai 2012). Furthermore,
once the buoyancy instability is triggered, the emergence
runs into a dynamic phase in which there is a strong inter-
action of the magnetic ﬁeld with the plasma, and the ﬁeld
cannot be force-free. However, when the ﬁeld emerges into
the atmosphere by a few scale heights above the photosphere,
it relaxes quickly to a closely force-free state because of
the fast decreasing of the plasma density and pressure with
height (Fan 2009). Thus the distribution of the Lorentz force
above the solar surface should be restricted mainly within a
small height. To quantify the global extent of this force, one
can make use of the Gauss’s law by expressing the net volu-
metric Lorentz force above the photosphere in a surface in-
tegral of Maxwell stress tensor of the photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld (Molodenskii 1969; Aly 1984; Low 1985; Fisher et al.
2012, see the formula in Section 2), which are observable
and thus the results can be used to compare with and con-
strain theories and simulations. There have been several
works done to estimate the global Lorentz force of ARs us-
ing the observed vector magnetograms from different instru-
ments (Metcalf et al. 1995; Moon et al. 2002; Tiwari 2012;
Liu et al. 2013; Liu & Hao 2015), and some of them con-
clude that the photospheric ﬁeld is actually not far away from
force-free (e.g., Moon et al. 2002; Tiwari 2012). However all
the previous studies are carried out using the snapshots of de-
veloped ARs without considering the case of ﬂux-emerging
ARs.

In this Letter, we perform a systematic survey of the
global force focusing on ARs in their full emergence
phase and using the vector magnetograms from Solar
Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(SDO/HMI) (Hoeksema et al. 2014), which are both done for
the ﬁrst time. Furthermore, in addition to checking the global
force, we also estimate the global Lorentz torque, which has
not been considered in previous investigations. Our results
show that the emerging photospheric ﬁelds are actually very
close to the force-free state, which is not consistent with the

results from typical idealized simulations of twisted ﬂux tube
emerging from below the photosphere. This result puts an
important constraint on the future development of theories
and simulations of ﬂux emergence.

2. METHOD AND DATA

Since the Lorentz force can be expressed as the divergence
of a tensor, the Maxwell stress, the integration of force in
a volume can be expressed as surface integral of the tensor.
Furthermore, by assuming that the emerging magnetic ﬁeld
above the photosphere (i.e., z > 0) is well isolated and its
strength falls off fast enough as going upward to inﬁnity, the
net Lorentz force F =
J × BdV in the volume of z > 0
can be expressed as integration of the Maxwell stress tensor
on the photosphere z = 0, which is given by (Aly 1984; Low
1985; Fisher et al. 2012)

We note that the same formula can also apply to the interior
volume below the surface (by removing the minus sign be-
fore the integrations) if the magnetic ﬁeld below the surface
is also well isolated, which, however, is not generally fulﬁlled
unless the surface integration is taken for the full sphere.

To compare the forces in different magnetic ﬁelds with dif-
ferent ﬂux contents, it is better to use a normalized measure-
ment. We follow Low (1985) and Metcalf et al. (1995) by
employing the integrated magnetic pressure force Fp given

and the normalized forces are ratios deﬁned as fx =
|Fx|/Fp, fy = |Fy|/Fp, and fz = |Fz|/Fp, respec-
tively. For a ﬁeld being close to force-free, it must have
all the ratios much less than unity, i.e., fx ≪ 1, fy ≪
1, and fz ≪ 1 (Low 1985). Metcalf et al. (1995) sug-
gested that the magnetic ﬁeld can be considered as force-
free completely if the normalized forces are all less than
or equal to 0.1, and this criterion is widely accepted by the
later studies (Moon et al. 2002; Tiwari 2012; Liu et al. 2013;
Liu & Hao 2015; Jiang & Zhang 2019). On the other hand,
for a strongly non force-free ﬁeld, the ratios can be close
to unity, meaning that the magnetic pressure force and the
tension force are so unbalanced that the net Lorentz force
is comparable to one of its components, the total magnetic
pressure force. The HMI team (Sun 2014) released a data
set, cgem.Lorentz, which also contains the integrated

Lorentz forces of the HMI vector magnetograms. A minor
difference exists between the horizontal normalized forces
we deﬁned here and the ones in cgem.Lorenzt, i.e., ǫx
and ǫy, and ǫz in Equation (4) in (Sun 2014), which are re-
lated by fx = 2|ǫx|, fy = 2|ǫy|, and fz = |ǫz|. We use the
cgem.Lorentz data to verify our calculations.

It should be noted that these ratios being less than 0.1 is
only a necessary condition for the ﬁelds to be force-free; even
if the global integration of force is zero, the forces locally in
different parts are not necessarily zero (for example, near
the edge of a sunspot, where the local Lorentz force is bal-
anced by gas pressure gradients). To put an additional con-
straint, we can compute the net torque induced by the Lorentz

where the origin of the coordinates (x, y) is set at the lower

A very important requirement in using the formula is that the

Last we note that since the formula of net force and torque,
Equations (1) and (3), are integrations of the pixels of magne-
togram, they are not sensitive to the resolutions of the mag-
netogram (see also Jiang & Zhang 2019); for instance, we
found that the results are almost unchanged by reducing res-
olution of the original magnetogram with a factor of 2 or
4. Furthermore, we found that calculations of the force and
torque are not very sensitive to the noise in the vector mag-
netograms. Bobra et al. (2014) state that, in the HMI vector
magnetograms, the ﬁeld strengths below 220 G are generally
considered to be noise. We have also calculated the forces
and torques by using only the ﬁeld above the noise threshold

space-weather HMI AR
patches (SHARP, Bobra et al. 2014) with deﬁnite NOAA
number observed from 2010 May, when SDO began to op-
erate, until the end of 2019. The following criteria are used
to select the ARs. First, we focus on the emerging phase
of ARs from almost nothing on the solar surface to its peak
ﬂux. Thus the ARs should have signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence
during their passing on the solar disk, i.e., the total unsigned
magnetic ﬂux shows a evolution trend of overall monotone
increase. Second, the target AR should be well separated
from the surrounding ARs (presumably a single ﬂux tube
emergence and isolated from interaction with signiﬁcant
pre-existing ﬁeld), so the positive and negative ﬂuxes of the
region can be balanced each other in a good degree, and
in particular we only select the ARs with the ﬂux-balance
parameter eﬂux < 0.1 during their emergence phase. Third,
to reduce the observation errors, we only select the duration
when the ARs are located within ±45◦ in longitude from the
Sun’s central meridian (as will be shown in the next section,
the distance of the observed AR to the solar disk center has
a systematic inﬂuence on the magnitudes of the forces and
torques). By all these criteria, we ﬁnally obtained 51 ARs
with signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence during their passage on the
solar disk. The ARs and their observed time durations are
listed in Table 1, including their start, end times and their
Carrington coordinates. The evolutions of total unsigned
magnetic ﬂuxes of all the ARs, calculated based on one-hour
cadence SHARP data and smoothed by a six-hour window,
are shown in Figure 1. As can be seen, overall the larger
the AR’s total ﬂux is, the faster the AR emerges (Otsuji et al.
2011; Norton et al. 2017). With all the ARs considered, there
are in total 3536 vector magnetograms obtained for our study
to compute the forces and torques of the photospheric ﬁeld.
We also take two typical, independently-developed ﬂux-
emergence MHD simulations as a comparison with the ob-
servations. The two MHD simulations are obtained from
Toriumi & Takasao (2017) and Syntelis et al. (2017), respec-
tively, for the aim of reproducing the birth of ARs with signif-
icant non-potentiality. Both simulations used typical settings
of a twisted ﬂux tube that is initially placed in the convection
zone (with several Mm below the photosphere) and buoy-
antly rises to the photosphere, where it partially emerges into
the corona. To compare the simulations with observations, it
is crucial to use the same physical height of photosphere. We
note that in the simulations, the photosphere is slightly lifted
by the emerging ﬂux, and the buoyancy instability essentially
happens at altitudes of approximately two scale heights (e.g.,
Fan 2009; Syntelis et al. 2017). Thus, we perform the force
and torque computations using the magnetic ﬁeld at three dif-

ferent heights, starting from z0, which is closest to z = 0 in
each numerical model, and moving upwards to the Parker
instability height (z2) at increments of around one pressure
scale height.

3. RESULTS

Before giving the statistical results, we ﬁrst show the evo-
lutions of two well-studied ARs, NOAA 11158 and 12673,
and compare them with the two ﬂux-emergence MHD sim-
ulations. Both the ARs have a fast ﬂux-emergence phase
during their passage on the solar disk and have strong non-
potentiality manifested by shearing and rotating motions of
the emerging sunspots (Sun et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2017;
Yan et al. 2018). As shown in Figure 2, both the ARs have
signiﬁcant ﬂux increase, with an average emerging rate of
∼ 5 × 1020 Mx h−1, and their ﬂuxes are very well balanced
(with eﬂux ∼ 0.05). The normalized forces and torques are
mostly less than 0.1 for the full duration, suggesting that
the ﬁeld is very close to force-free in the emergence process.
Note that for the normalized forces, our results are almost
identical to those directly from the cgem.Lorentz data
set.

In the simulations, although their ﬂux contents are smaller
by at least two orders of magnitude than the two ARs, their
peak emerging rates are comparable the observed ones. Since
the two simulations use similar settings, they show very sim-
ilar evolution, with a very fast rising and saturation of the
ﬂuxes in roughly an hour, while the observed ones have a
steady ﬂux increase for several days. The very distinct dif-
ference between the simulations and the observed ARs lies
in the forces and torques: once the photospheric magnetic
ﬂuxes begin to increase in the simulations, the forces and
torques in all the three levels (see z0, z1 and z2 labeled in
the Figure 2) rise to signiﬁcantly larger values (∼ 0.8 for
fz) and torques (∼ 0.6 for tx and ty), attaining the order
of unity. This means that in the simulated cases, the bal-
ance between the tension and magnetic pressure gradient is
strongly destroyed, i.e., in the extremely non-force-free state.
For the z0 level, this strongly-forced state occurs during the
entire emerging phase, while for a little higher, the force and

Syntelis et al. (2017)’s simulation, they decrease rather fast
at z2 where the Parker instability happens, reaching almost
zero when the ﬂux saturates. Therefore, our results show that
during the ﬂux injection phase, i.e. around the emergence
rate peak, the forces and torques in typical ﬂux emergence
models are much larger than the observed ones. However
later, the dynamics settle to more realistic values. Note that
it is due to the perfect symmetry of two emerging polarities
in the simulations that the net forces in horizontal directions
(i.e., fx and fy) and the net torques in vertical direction (tz)
are both zero.

Figure 3 shows the histograms of normalized forces and
torques for all the 3536 magnetograms with both the average
and median values denoted. The averages and standard de-
viations for the forces are respectively, fx = 0.15 ± 0.10,
fy = 0.13 ± 0.08, and fz = 0.13 ± 0.08. Thus all of
them are close to 0.1, at which the ﬁeld can be regarded as
force-free (Metcalf et al. 1995). The median values of the
forces are systematically smaller by a little bit than their
average values. The averages and standard deviations for
the normalized torques are respectively, tx = 0.05 ± 0.03,
ty = 0.11 ± 0.07, and tz = 0.12 ± 0.09. The torques show
a slight dependence on the direction; tx is approximately a
half of ty and tz.
In any case, on average, both the rela-
tive forces and torques of the magnetograms are close to 0.1,
thus they can be regarded as being close to force-free. We
note that with such a much larger set of emerging AR sam-
ples than previous statistical studies using the snapshots of
developed ARs (Moon et al. 2002; Tiwari 2012), our results
conﬁrm that the photospheric ﬁeld is actually not far from the
force-free state, even in the dynamically emerging phase.

To explore whether there are correlations between the
forces (and torques) and key parameters during the ﬂux
emergence of ARs, such as the total unsigned magnetic
ﬂux Φu,
the ﬂux changing rate dΦu/dt and the non-
potentiality, which is quantiﬁed by the average twist param-
eter αtot (Bobra et al. 2014) deﬁned by

three parameters Φu, dΦu/dt, and αtot, respectively. For
simplicity, as we only care about the magnitudes, we use
average of the three components of force and torque by
eforce = (fx + fy + fz)/3 and etorque = (tx + ty + tz)/3.
As can be seen, no systematic correlation is found between
the forces (and torques) with either the total magnetic ﬂux of
the ARs, the emergence rates or the non-potentiality.

We further analyzed whether the force and torque are in-
ﬂuenced by the observed locations of the ARs, since the fur-
ther away from the solar disk center the target AR is, the
larger the measurement errors would be. Indeed, as shown
in the last column of Figure 4, an approximately linear cor-
relation is seen in the force (and torque) with the distance
of the observed AR from the disk center. It shows that the
closer to the disk center, the smaller the force (and torque) is.
Thus, the increase of the forces (and torques) is most likely
due to the errors in the observations, and with a better qual-

ity of observed data, presumably the force and torque will
be smaller, meaning that the emerging ﬁeld is actually even
closer to force-free than than the results shown here.

4. DISCUSSION

In this Letter, we have, for the ﬁrst time, systematically
surveyed the normalized magnitudes of the global Lorentz
forces and torques in solar ﬂux-emergence ARs observed by
SDO/HMI. It is found that even during the ﬂux-emergence
phase, i.e., the formation of ARs, the magnetic ﬁeld in the
photosphere is generally close to force-free state, since the
relative measurements of the Lorentz force and torque are
mostly on the order of 0.1. There seems to be no correla-
tion between the magnitude of normalized force and torque
with the total unsigned ﬂux content of the emerging ARs, the
emergence rate, or the non-potentiality of the ﬁeld. The only
systematic correlation of the force (and torque) is found to
be with the observed location of the ARs on the solar disk,
that is, the closer to the solar disk center, the closer to force-
free the ﬁeld is. Therefore, this suggests that the actual mag-
netic ﬁeld is even more force-free than what the statistic re-
sults show here. It can explain why many nonlinear force-
free coronal-ﬁeld extrapolations based directly on the pho-
tospheric vector magneotgrams generally agrees with each
other to some extent (e.g., Wiegelmann 2004; Valori et al.
2007; Wiegelmann & Sakurai 2012; Jiang & Feng 2013;
Inoue et al. 2014), although there are still some mismatches
between the models, and the mismatches can be further alle-
viated through a preprocessing of the vector magnetograms,
in which the photospheric ﬁelds are able to be rendered
highly force-free by adjusting the observed data within the
noise level (Wiegelmann et al. 2006; Jiang & Feng 2014;
Duan & Zhang 2018).

Our results show that during the emergence phase, ide-
alized ﬂux emergence simulations in which a twisted ﬂux
tube is artiﬁcially made buoyant to rise through the convec-
tion zone, show signiﬁcantly larger forces (in comparison to
the total magnetic pressure force) at the photosphere than the
ones measured by our observations. It is after the ﬂux in-
jection phase, when the photospheric ﬂux saturates, that the
models tend to settle to more realistic photospheric force and
torque ratios. This is suggestive of a discrepancy between
simulations and observations. Very recently, using the the
ﬂux emergence simulation of Toriumi & Takasao (2017) as a
ground-truth data set (the same one we have analyzed in this
Letter as shown in Figure 2), Toriumi et al. (2020) performed
a joint comparison of different data-driven coronal ﬁeld evo-
lution models that using the photospheric magnetograms pro-
duced in the simulated ﬂux emergence as input to their bot-
tom boundaries (Cheung & DeRosa 2012; Jiang et al. 2016;
Hayashi et al. 2019; Guo et al. 2019). It was found that, al-
though all the data-driven models reproduced a ﬂux rope

structure, the quantitative discrepancies are large, which is
attributed mainly to the highly non-force-free input photo-
spheric ﬁeld and to the treatment of background atmosphere.
Especially, for a data-driven MHD model (Jiang et al. 2016)
that used typical settings of the tenuous atmosphere in the
corona (i.e., very low plasma β and high Alfv´en speed),
the reproduced magnetic ﬂux rope is signiﬁcantly larger in
size and stronger in ﬁeld-line twisting than those in the
original simulation as well as other data-driven MHD mod-
els that use typically dense plasma near the lower bound-
ary (e.g., Guo et al. 2019; Hayashi et al. 2019). This discrep-
ancy clearly arises from too strong Lorentz force of the sim-
ulated photospheric ﬁeld, which cannot be balanced by the
plasma in Jiang et al. (2016)’s model, and thus the ﬂux rope
can rise strongly upward and be freely twisted by the Lorentz
force and torque, which leads to the strong magnetic energy
and helicity in the corona. Thus, a further test of the data-
driven models with more realistic and thus more force-free
photospheric magnetic ﬁeld needs to be done in future.

By comparing the ﬂux emergence rates from observa-
tions with those from typical MHD simulations, Norton et al.
(2017) have found that the observed emergence rates are
smaller than those in simulations, which indicates a slower
rise of the ﬂux in the interior than what is captured in sim-
ulations. That ﬁnding is consistent with ours, since with
a slower emergence rate, the emerging ﬁeld at the photo-
sphere have more time to relax, and consequently, be more
force-free. In other words, the emergence at the photosphere
might actually proceed in a quasi-static way rather than the
dynamic one as shown in simulations. There are several as-
pects that can be adjusted in simulations to make the ﬁeld
emerge slower and thus, potentially, closer to force-free (and
torque-free) in the photosphere. The ﬁrst one is the depth
where the initial ﬂux tube is placed; both the simulations
we used here have a ﬂux tube placed near the solar sur-
face, while with a ﬂux tube placed much deeper in the in-
terior, it can expand and stretch with more time to relax dur-
ing its rising and should become more force-free than ini-
tially (e.g., Toriumi & Yokoyama 2011; Syntelis et al. 2019).
The second one is the twist degree of the initial ﬂux tube;
stronger twist can of course create increased torque dur-
ing its emerging in the photosphere (Sturrock et al. 2015;
Sturrock & Hood 2016). The third one might be attributed
to geometry of the emerging tube and how it couples with
twist and the size of the ﬂux tube, which has been discussed
in Syntelis et al. (2019). Finally, to include realistic turbulent
convection in the modeling can further yield much relaxed
emergence process (Toriumi & Hotta 2019).
In summary,
our study shows that the photosphere ﬁeld is very close to
force-free during the emergence process, and this fact should
be taken into consideration in future development of MHD
simulations as well as the theories of ﬂux emergence.

Figure 2. Comparison of different parameters from two observed ﬂux-emerging ARs and numerical simulations. From top to bottom are,
respectively, evolution of the total unsigned ﬂux, ﬂux emergence rate, normalized Lorentz force and torque. From left to right are results
for AR 11158, AR 12673, simulations of Toriumi & Takasao (2017) and Syntelis et al. (2017), respectively. For the simulations we show the
results for three different heights, which are (z0, z1, z2) = (0.14, 0.28, 0.42) Mm in Toriumi & Takasao (2017)’s simulation, and (z0, z1, z2) =
(0.12, 0.28, 0.43) Mm in Syntelis et al. (2017)’s simulation. The horizontal axes show the time for different events. Note that in the plots of
normalized forces for the two ARs, the results from the cgem.Lorentz data set, i.e., ǫx, ǫy, and ǫz, deﬁned in Sun (2014) are also shown for
a double-checking of our calculations.

Figure 4. Distributions of magnetic force and magnetic torque with different parameters. The top panels are for magnetic force, and the bottom
ones are for magnetic torque. The horizontal axes from the left to right columns represent, respectively, the total unsigned ﬂux Φu, the ﬂux
changing rate dΦu/dt, the mean twist parameter αtot, and distance of the ARs from the solar disk center (in unit of solar radius Rsun). The
colors indicate ratios of events in a speciﬁc bin. Here the bins for magnetic force and magnetic torque are both 0.02; and for Φu, dΦu/dt, αtot
and distance, they are 0.5 × 1022 Mx, 1 × 1020 Mx h−1, 0.01 Mm−1 and 0.02Rsun, respectively.
