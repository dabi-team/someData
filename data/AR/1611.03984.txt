Abstract We report on the co-existence of longitudinal and transverse oscilla-
tions in an active ﬁlament. On March 15th 2013, a M1.1 class ﬂare was observed
in the active region AR 11692. A CME was found to be associated with the
ﬂare. The CME generated a shock wave that triggered the oscillations in a
nearby ﬁlament, situated at the south-west of the active region as observed from
National Solar Observatory (NSO)Global Oscillation Network Group(GONG)
Hα images. In this work we report the longitudinal oscillations in the two ends
of the ﬁlament, co-existing with the transverse oscillations. We propose a sce-
nario in which an incoming shock wave hits the ﬁlament obliquely and triggers
both longitudinal and transverse oscillations. Using the observed parameters, we
estimate the lower limit of the magnetic ﬁeld strength. We use simple pendulum
model with gravity as the restoring force to estimate the radius of curvature.
We also calculate the mass accretion rate which causes the ﬁlament motions to
damp quite fast.

1. Introduction

Filaments support both longitudinal and transverse oscillations (see, Arregui,
Oliver, and Ballester, 2012). The oscillations in the ﬁlaments can be used to
diagnose the local plasma conditions and magnetic ﬁeld by applying the principle
of MHD seismology (see, Nakariakov and Verwichte, 2005; Andries, Arregui,
and Goossens, 2005). These oscillations are broadly classiﬁed as large amplitude
(Tripathi, Isobe, and Jain, 2009) and small amplitude (Oliver and Ballester,
2002) oscillations. Large amplitude transverse oscillations, where a ﬁlament os-
cillates as whole, are often associated with the disturbances coming from nearby
ﬂares (Ramsey and Smith, 1966; Isobe and Tripathi, 2006; Okamoto et al., 2004;
Hershaw et al., 2011; Schmieder et al., 2013; Pant et al., 2015). In contrast,
the large amplitude longitudinal oscillations are always found to be associated
with small energetic events like a subﬂare at one leg of the ﬁlament (Jing et al.,
2003), a small ﬂare in a nearby active region (Jing et al., 2006; Vrˇsnak et al.,
2007; Li and Zhang, 2012) or jets (Luna et al., 2014). There have been several
reports on large amplitude longitudinal oscillations (Jing et al., 2003, 2006;
Vrˇsnak et al., 2007; Luna and Karpen, 2012; Luna, D´ıaz, and Karpen, 2012;
Zhang et al., 2012; Luna et al., 2014). Luna and Karpen (2012) developed a 1D
self-consistent model which explained both restoring force and damping of large
amplitude longitudinal oscillations. The model is analogous to an oscillating
pendulum assuming the radius of curvature of magnetic dip as the length of the
pendulum. Luna et al. (2014) used this model to explain the strong damping
of large amplitude longitudinal oscillations observed in the ﬁlament threads.
Recently, Luna et al. (2016) performed 2D non-linear time dependent MHD
simulations where a magnetic ﬁeld can get distorted in response to the mass
loading. The authors have reported that a simple pendulum model can be used
to characterise the large amplitude longitudinal oscillations even in a scenario
where the magnetic ﬁeld responds to the plasma motions.
Damping of oscillations have been observed in large amplitude transverse oscil-
lations (Hershaw et al., 2011; Pant et al., 2015). Goossens, Andries, and Arregui
(2006); Arregui et al. (2007) used seismology combining the damping time and
period of oscillations in a consistent manner to estimate the magnetic ﬁeld
strength and inhomogeneity length scale in the coronal loops. Arregui et al.
(2008) applied the same technique to the oscillating threads of a prominence.
Pant et al. (2015) applied this technique to estimate magnetic ﬁeld and inhomo-
geneity length scale of a ﬁlament as whole.
In addition to transverse oscillations, large amplitude longitudinal oscillations
are also found to be damped (Luna and Karpen, 2012; Luna et al., 2014). Unlike
transverse oscillations, that are now believed to be damped by the resonant
absorption, damping mechanisms in longitudinal oscillations are not well under-
stood. Several damping mechanisms have been proposed, e.g., energy leakage
(Kleczek and Kuperus, 1969), dissipation (Tripathi, Isobe, and Jain, 2009) but
these mechanisms are under debate. However, mass accretion due to the con-
densation of ﬁlament material (Luna and Karpen, 2012; Luna et al., 2014, 2016;
Ruderman and Luna, 2016) is shown to be promising in explaining the damping
of longitudinal oscillations in a ﬁlament. Recently, Ruderman and Luna (2016)

SOLA: filament_11_nov.tex; 28 March 2021; 22:41; p. 2

Oscillation in ﬁlament

have reported the evidence of strong damping of longitudinal oscillations in the
ﬁlament threads that are modelled as a curved magnetic tube.
Shen et al. (2014) reported that an incoming shock wave can trigger longitudinal
and transverse oscillations in the ﬁlaments depending on the interaction angle
between the ﬁlament and the shock wave. Gilbert et al. (2008) has reported
coexistence of two transverse oscillation modes, one in the plane of sky and other
along the line of sight, in a ﬁlament in response to a Moreton wave. Both modes
were perpendicular to the ﬁlament axis. In this work, we report a unique ob-
servation of the co-existence of large amplitude damped longitudinal oscillations
and large amplitude damped transverse oscillations in an active region ﬁlament.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we describe the observations.
In Section 3 we discuss the methods of data analysis. We present the results in
Section 4, which is followed by the discussion and conclusions in Section 5.

2. Observation

A M1.1 Class ﬂare was observed by GOES satellite in an active region AR 11692
on March 15th 2013. The ﬂare was associated with a halo coronal mass ejection
(CME). The ﬂare created a global disturbance in the active region. The CME
associated with the ﬂare produced a shock wave. To observe shock fronts, we
created running diﬀerence images of AIA 193 ˚A. The shock fronts are marked
with red and green arrows in Figure 1. It is evident from Figure 1 that the shock
fronts are moving outward.

(cid:48)(cid:48)

A ﬁlament was lying to the south-west of the active region as seen in Hα
images from NSO/GONG (Figure 2). NSO/GONG provides full-disk observation
of the Sun in 6563 ˚A (Hα). It has a pixel resolution of ∼ 1.07
and a cadence of
1 sec. The observational data used in this study are obtained from 06:00:54 UT
to 10:22:54 UT. The ﬂare started at 05:46:00 UT, peaked at 06:58:00 UT and
ended at 08:35:00 UT as recorded in GOES catalogue. We note that just after
the onset of the ﬂare, oscillations were triggered in the ﬁlament.
Filaments consist of ﬁne threads that are not often seen in GONG Hα images
due to its poor spatial resolution. Therefore, we use the images from the extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) passbands of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard
Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). AIA instrument provides almost simultane-
ous full-disk images of the Sun in seven EUV band. It has a spatial resolution
of 1.3(cid:48)(cid:48), pixel size of 0.6(cid:48)(cid:48) and a cadence of 12 s (Lemen et al., 2012). We ﬁnd
that the ﬁlament consists of several threads that are seen more clearly in AIA
171 ˚A than any other EUV passbands of AIA. Therefore, we use AIA 171 ˚A for
further analysis. Moreover, we ﬁnd that shortly after the oscillations started, the
full disk images of the Sun were not available from 06:22:23 UT to 07:36:00 UT.
Thus, the ﬁrst cycle of oscillations is not seen in AIA 171 ˚A.
We overplot the contours of the ﬁlament as seen in GONG Hα over the magne-
togram obtained from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard SDO
(Figure 3). We ﬁnd that the ﬁlament lies over the region which separates the
positive and the negative polarity. We note from the movie (available online)
that at 06:11:59 UT, i.e before eruption, the ﬁlament material as enclosed in

SOLA: filament_11_nov.tex; 28 March 2021; 22:41; p. 3

V. Pant et al.

two diﬀerent contours are part of the same ﬁlament (Pant et al., 2015, right
panel of Figure 1).
By careful inspection of the Hα images in the movie (available online), it appears
that both longitudinal and transverse oscillations are present simultaneously in
the ﬁlament. In the movie (available online), we mark the ﬁlament in AIA images
with a green arrow. The transverse oscillations in the ﬁlament under study are
already reported in Pant et al. (2015). In this paper, we focus on longitudinal
oscillations at two parts of the ﬁlament adjacent to its two ends.

green represent the shock front.
3. Data Analysis

3.1. GONG Hα

To investigate the longitudinal oscillations in GONG Hα images, we place two
artiﬁcial broad slices, slit 1 and slit 2 along the axis of the ﬁlament as shown in
Figure 2. The length (width) of the 1st and the 2nd slice is 130 pixel (15 pixel)
and 60 pixel (20 pixel) respectively. The ﬁlament is oscillating in both transverse
and longitudinal directions simultaneously. We choose broad slices so that the
ﬁlament material remain inside the slices in spite of the transverse oscillations.
To further characterise the longitudinal oscillations in the ﬁlament, ﬁrst we
create a time-distance (x–t) map with time in x axis and distance along the slice
in y axis for both slit 1 and slit 2. Intensity along each column of the x–t map is
ﬁtted with a Gaussian curve. The mean value and one sigma error of the intensity
is estimated. Finally the x–t map is ﬁtted with a damped sinusoidal function
to investigate the oscillation characteristics. Since the ﬁlament is oscillating and
the amplitude of the oscillations is decreasing with time, it can be ﬁtted with a

Oscillation in ﬁlament

11692. Two broad artiﬁcial slices along the axis of the ﬁlament, used for generating x–t maps,
are over plotted. Three artiﬁcial slits perpendicular to the axis of ﬁlament are overplotted
in green, red and yellow, which were used in Pant et al. (2015) to investigate the transverse
oscillations.

damped sinusoidal function (assuming the mass of the ﬁlament to be constant)
and represented as (Aschwanden et al., 1999),

y(t) = c + Asinsin(ωt + φsin)e−t/τsin ,

(1)

where c is a constant, Asin is the amplitude, τsin is the damping time, ω is
the angular frequency, and φsin is the initial phase of sinusoidal function. The

SOLA: filament_11_nov.tex; 28 March 2021; 22:41; p. 5

V. Pant et al.

least square ﬁtting is done using the function MPFIT.pro in Interactive Data
Language (IDL) (Markwardt, 2009). It has been shown that if a ﬁlament accretes
mass then the Bessel function describes the oscillations better than the damped
sinusoid (Luna and Karpen, 2012). Therefore, we ﬁt the x–t map using a damped
zeroth order Bessel function of ﬁrst kind, represented by

y(t) = c1 + AbesJ0(ωt + φbes)e−t/τbes,

(2)

where c1 is a constant, Abes is amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, τbes is the
damping time, and φbes is the phase of the Bessel function.

3.2. AIA 171 ˚A

We repeat the analysis on AIA 171 ˚A images but with only one artiﬁcial slice.
The ﬁlament material at the position of slit 2 is not clearly seen in AIA 304, 171
and 193 ˚A due to the presence of overlying post-ﬂare loops (see movie).

4. Results

4.1. GONG Hα

The period, damping time and amplitude estimated from the ﬁtting of a damped
sinusoidal function represented by Equation (1) are summarized in Table 1. The
period, damping time and amplitude estimated from the ﬁtting of a damped
zeroth order Bessel function of ﬁrst kind represented by Equation (2) is sum-
marized in Table 2. In the right panel of Figure 4, we overplot dashed green
lines at three time instances. It is evident that both ends of the ﬁlament started
oscillating in diﬀerent phase. It is also worth noting that the oscillations started
at diﬀerent times in the two ends of the ﬁlament.

4.2. AIA 171 ˚A

The period of oscillation is found to be 57±3 min which is similar to the period
estimated at the position of slit 1 in GONG Hα. The damping time is estimated
to be 100 min which is larger as compared to the damping time estimated using
slit 1 in GONG Hα images. Amplitude of oscillation is found to be 10 Mm which
is less than the amplitude measured in GONG Hα images. The main reason of
large damping time and smaller amplitude is that, ﬁrst cycle of the oscillations
is missed in AIA 171 ˚A images, therefore the oscillations start after 100 min as
shown in Figure 5 (right panel). We note from Figure 4 (top right panel) that
the estimated damping time of oscillations and amplitude are strongly dependent
on ﬁrst cycle of the oscillations. If ﬁrst cycle of oscillations is missed then the
damping time will be longer and amplitude will be smaller. Another reason
can be that the ﬁlament threads apparently merge and separate during the
oscillations. This may be attributed to the fact that multiple threads are stacked
along the line of sight, so if they are not moving in phase it may appear that

Oscillation in ﬁlament

they are merging and separating. This is probably also related to the presence of
transverse oscillations because such eﬀect is not reported in earlier studies (Luna
and Karpen, 2012) where only longitudinal oscillations were present. Therefore,
there is large uncertainty in choosing the thread that is associated with the
oscillations (see right panel of Figure 5). It is worth noting at this point that
we did not ﬁt damped Bessel function to AIA dataset because, as said above,
the ﬁrst cycle of oscillation is missed thus the Bessel function will not give the
correct estimation of the damping time.

the data gap between 07:07:54 Ut to 07:18:54 UT. The time period, amplitude and the damping
time obtained from ﬁtting is mentioned at the top of the plot. The lower left panel is same as
upper left but for slit 2. In the upper right panel we plot the ﬁtted damped sinusoidal curve with
one sigma error bar. The lower right panel is same for the slice 2. Three vertical dashed lines
over plotted at three time instances show that the oscillations started with diﬀerent phases.
The dotted black curve represents the best ﬁt damped sinusoidal function while orange curve
represents the damped Bessel function

4.3. Radius of curvature of magnetic dip

Filament material is supported by the magnetic ﬁelds against gravity. We use
a simple pendulum model to estimate the oscillation parameters (Luna and
Karpen, 2012). Assuming restoring force to be gravity, we get the following
equation

ω =

2π
P

=

(cid:114) g0
R

,

(3)

where g0 is the Sun’s surface gravity, ω is the oscillation frequency, P is the
period of oscillation and R is the radius of curvature. Using Equation (3), the

ﬁlament. The right panel represents the x–t map corresponding to the curve artiﬁcial slice
shown in the left panel. The thick black vertical strip represents the data gap. Black curve
represents the best ﬁt sinusoidal function. The time period, amplitude and the damping time
obtained from ﬁtting is mentioned at the top.

radius of curvature in GONG Hα images is estimated to be ∼ 80 Mm and 85
Mm at the position of dip 1 (where 1st slice is placed) and dip 2 (where 2nd slice
is placed; see, Figure 2) respectively. Similarly, the radius of curvature at the
location of dip 1 (see left hand panel of Figure 5 where artiﬁcial slice is placed)
in AIA 171 ˚A is estimated to be 80 Mm.

4.4. Estimation of magnetic ﬁeld strength

We calculate a lower limit of the magnetic ﬁeld strength, assuming that magnetic
stress is balanced by the weight of the ﬁlament material present in a dip (Luna
and Karpen, 2012), using the following expression,

B(G) ≥ 26

(cid:17) 1

2

(cid:16) ne
1011

P,

(4)

where B is the magnetic ﬁeld, ne is the electron number density in cm−3 and
P is the period of oscillation in hours. Here we use the typical value of electron
number density 1011 cm−3 as reported in Labrosse et al. (2010). Therefore,
minimum magnetic ﬁeld strength is estimated to be ∼ (25 ± 1) G both in dip 1
and dip 2 which is consistent with the typical values of the measured magnetic
ﬁelds in the ﬁlaments (Labrosse et al., 2010; Mackay et al., 2010). Since the
period of oscillation is estimated to be the same using AIA 171 ˚A, the estimated
magnetic ﬁeld strength remains unchanged.

4.5. Estimation of the Mass Accretion Parameter

In the model given by Luna and Karpen (2012), the damping of longitudinal
oscillations in threads of the ﬁlaments is explained by the accretion of ﬁlament
material. We calculate the mass accretion rate from the best ﬁt parameters of
the damped Bessel function (represented by Equation (2)), using the following
relation (Luna et al., 2014),

α =

ωm0
φbes

,

where, m0 is the initial mass of ﬁlament, ω and φbes are the obtained from ﬁtting
of the damped Bessel function. The mass of a ﬁlament, m0 can be calculated as
m0 = 1.27mpneπr2L, where r and L are the radius and the length of the thread
of the ﬁlament. We take the typical radius of a ﬁlament thread to be 100 km as
assumed in Luna et al. (2014). The length of the thread is estimated using x–t
map as shown in Figure 4 (top panel). As explained above, the artiﬁcial slit is
placed along the length of the ﬁlament. Thus the extent of the brightness along
each column of the x–t map gives an estimate of the length of the ﬁlament thread
at a particular time instance. The length of the ﬁlament thread is measured at
various time instances (i.e, along diﬀerent columns) from the start to the end of
the oscillations. Finally, we estimate the mean value of the length of the ﬁlament
thread ∼ 23± 7 Mm at the position of slit 1. Following the above procedure, the
length of the ﬁlament thread at the position of slit 2 is estimated ∼ 10±4 Mm. It
should be borne in mind that the estimation of the length of the ﬁlament thread
at the position of slit 2 is uncertain because the oscillations are not clearly seen in
the x–t maps as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 4. Under these assumptions
we estimated the mass accretion rate at the position of slit 1 and 2 to be ∼ (51
± 17 ×106 kg hr−1) and (192 ± 72 ×106 kg hr−1) respectively. The derived mass
accretion rate at the position of slit 1 is comparable to those reported in earlier
studies (Luna et al., 2014). It should be noted that at the position of slit 2 the
mass accretion rate is higher while damping time is longer. One of the reasons
for this discrepancy is the uncertainty in the ﬁtting parameters. Since the mass
accretion rate depends on the phase of the Bessel function which is estimated
from the best ﬁt parameters. Therefore, if the ﬁtting of a function is not good
then the value of phase will have large errors and thus can not be trusted.

4.6. Possibility of existence of both longitudinal and transverse wave

from kink oscillation

In this subsection we investigate the possibility of the existence of both lon-
gitudinal and transverse oscillations driven by kink oscillations. We assume
the ﬁlament as a cylinder embedded in a uniform plasma with low plasma β.
Magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be constant inside the cylinder and the eﬀects of
gravity is ignored. The model set up is similar to the one described in Yuan
and Van Doorsselaere (2016). To get the variation of thermodynamic quantities,
linearized ideal MHD equations are used (see Ruderman and Erd´elyi, 2009),

We take the length of slit 2 as length of the ﬁlament, which is estimated to be
90 Mm. The radius of the ﬁlament is estimated to be ∼ 1 Mm. It is important
to note that here we assume the length of the ﬂux tube (modelled as a ﬁlament)
as the length of the slit covering the ﬁlament material because here we compare

longitudinal oscillations with the transverse oscillations as reported by Pant
et al. (2015), where authors assumed that ﬁlament was oscillating as a whole
in the transverse direction. To estimate the ratio of the axial to radial velocity
amplitude, we choose three slit positions as shown in green, red and yellow lines
in Figure 2, that were used by Pant et al. (2015). From observations, we ﬁnd that
the longitudinal velocity amplitude to the transverse velocity amplitude ratio at
these locations are 3.92, 3.26 and 2.22 respectively. Using Equation (12), we
estimate the ratio to be 4 · 10−4, 2 · 10−4 and 1 · 10−5 respectively assuming
typical value of sound speed in chromosphere as 15 km s−1, Alfv´en speed in three
slit positions as 82, 88 and 91 km s−1 respectively and perturbation frequency
(assumed to be equal to the kink oscillation frequency) to be 117, 124 and 128
km s−1 respectively (see, Pant et al., 2015). It should be borne in mind that a
linear analysis is presented here. Considering the observed displacement to be
large, non-linear eﬀects would become important. Therefore to model such events
further studies are needed. Nevertheless, from above analysis, we note that it is
almost impossible to detect longitudinal oscillation in low-β plasma as a result
of fast kink mode in our observation. Therefore, large amplitude longitudinal
oscillations cannot be the kink mode.

5. Interaction of shock with ﬁlament

In this section, we explore the most likely mechanism for driving the longitudinal
and transverse oscillations in a ﬁlament channel. Shen et al. (2014) reported
that shock waves can interact with ﬁlaments in two possible geometries. If shock
waves come such that the normal vector to the shock wave is perpendicular to
the ﬁlament axis then a ﬁlament oscillates in the transverse direction. While if
the shock wave interacts with a ﬁlament such that the normal vector of the
shock wave is parallel to the ﬁlament axis then a ﬁlament oscillates in the
longitudinal direction. Here we are proposing a more general scenario where a
shock wave interacts obliquely with the ﬁlament such that the ﬁlament material
oscillates in both transverse and longitudinal direction as revealed from our
observations. The position of the shock fronts in our observations are clearly
seen in Figure 1. However, it should be borne in mind that from observations it
is not straight forward to determine the direction of shock with respect to the
ﬁlament because the ﬁlament is in close proximity of the active region and is
associated with overlying loops that expand in response to the shock wave. This
makes it extremely diﬃcult to determine the orientation of the shock wave.

We depict this by a cartoon in Figure 6. We show that when a shock wave hit
a ﬁlament obliquely, the normal vector to the wave front, ˆn (shown in dark red),
can be decomposed into perpendicular (n⊥) and parallel (n||) components as
shown in Figure 6 in blue. The component parallel to the ﬁlament axis triggers
the longitudinal oscillations in the ﬁlament while the component perpendicular
to the ﬁlament axis triggers the transverse oscillations in the ﬁlament. Thus
the shock front interacts with the ﬁlament at dip 1 and displaces the ﬁlament
material in both transverse and longitudinal direction. Similarly in dip 2 the
shock front displaces the plasma in both transverse and longitudinal directions,

Oscillation in ﬁlament

Figure 6. A cartoon depicting the interaction of a shock wave with a ﬁlament. The ﬁlament
has two magnetic dips, Dip 1 and Dip 2. The ﬁlament material is shown in green. The shock
wave front is represented by red curves. The normal vector to shock wave front is shown in
dark red. Arrows in blue represent the parallel and perpendicular component of the normal
vector.

but at a diﬀerent time. With this schematic picture we can explain the diﬀerent
start time of longitudinal oscillation at two ends of the ﬁlament. However, with
this scenario, one should expect the transverse oscillations to be present at the
locations of both dips but transverse oscillations are only observed at the location
of dip 1. It is worth noting that this is the simple geometry. In principle many
parts of the shock wave can interact with the ﬁlament at diﬀerent orientations
and can excite diﬀerent modes. Further studies are needed to conﬁrm this.

6. Summary and Conclusions

In this work, we ﬁnd the co-existence of longitudinal and transverse oscillations
in an active region ﬁlament as observed by NSO/GONG Hα. The oscillations
are triggered by the interaction of a shock wave with the ﬁlament. We ﬁnd that
the oscillations in two ends of the ﬁlament started with diﬀerent phase but with
almost similar period of oscillations. We note that the longitudinal oscillations
at two slit positions started at diﬀerent times (see, Figure 4) may be because
the shock wave front interacts with the two parts of ﬁlament at diﬀerent time
instances. We depict it with a schematic diagram (see, Figure 6).

The damping time at the position of slit 1 is estimated to be 46 minute.
This is a bit too strong as compared to the earlier reports (Tripathi, Isobe, and
Jain, 2009) and comparable to what is reported in Luna et al. (2014). Luna
and Karpen (2012) suggested that the mass accretion of the ﬁlament material

is responsible for damping. We ﬁnd mass accretion rate to be 51 ± 17 ×106
kg hr−1 at the position of slit 1 and 192 ± 72 ×106 kg hr−1 at the position
of slit 2 which is comparable with the earlier reports (Luna et al., 2014). We
performed the ﬁlament seismology and estimated the magnetic ﬁeld strength at
two dip locations. We estimated the lower limit of the magnetic ﬁeld strength
∼ (25 ± 1) G at the location of both the slices which is consistent with typical
values of measured magnetic ﬁeld from observation (Mackay et al., 2010). We
also calculate the radius of curvature of two magnetic dips of the ﬁlament as 80
Mm and 85 Mm for dip 1 and dip 2, respectively.

From our observations we exclude the possibility of existence of transverse and
longitudinal oscillation simultaneously driven by a fast kink mode. Longitudinal
oscillations due to kink wave may be present but their amplitude is far less as
compared to the amplitude of the longitudinal oscillations observed in this case.
Thus we believe that transverse and longitudinal oscillations exist independently
in the ﬁlament under study.
