Abstract	

Monolithic	 realization	 of	 metallic	 1T	 and	 semiconducting	 2H	 polymorphic	 phases	
makes	MoS2	a	potential	candidate	for	future	microelectronic	circuits.	Though	co-existence	
of	these	phases	has	been	reported,	a	method	for	engineering	a	stable	1T	phase	in	a	scalable	
manner,	 compatible	 with	 the	 standard	 device	 fabrication	 schemes	 is	 yet	 to	 emerge.	 In	
addition,	there	are	no	comprehensive	studies	on	the	electrical	properties	of	the	1T	phase.	
In	this	manuscript,	we	demonstrate	a	controllable	and	scalable	2H	to	1T	phase	engineering	
technique	for	MoS2	using	Ar	+	H2	microwave	plasma.		The	technique	enables	us	to	realize	
1T	 MoS2	 starting	 from	 the	 2H	 phase	 of	 arbitrary	 thickness	 and	 area.	 Our	 method	 allows	
lithographically	defining	continuous	1T	regions	in	a	2H	sample.	The	1T	samples	withstand	
aging	 in	 excess	 of	 a	 few	 weeks	 in	 ambience	 and	 show	 a	 thermal	 stability	 up	 to	 300˚C,	
making	it	suitable	for	standard	device	fabrication	techniques.	We	conduct	both	two-probe	
and	 four-probe	 electrical	 transport	 measurements	 on	 devices	 with	 back-gated	 field	 effect	
transistor	geometry	in	a	temperature	range	of	4	K	to	300	K.	The	1T	samples	exhibit	Ohmic	
current-voltage	 characteristics	 in	 all	 temperature	 ranges	 without	 any	 dependence	 to	 the	
gate	 voltage,	 a	 signature	 indicative	 of	 metallic	 state.	 The	 sheet	 resistance	 of	 our	 1T	 MoS2	
sample	is	considerably	lower	than	that	of	2H	samples	while	the	carrier	concentration	of	the	
1T	sample	is	few	orders	of	magnitude	higher	than	that	of	the	2H	samples.	In	addition,	our	
samples	 show	 negligible	 temperature	 dependence	 of	 resistance	 from	 4	 K	 to	 300	 K	 ruling	
out	any	hoping	mediated	or	activated	electrical	transport.

Introduction	

An	 all	 two-dimensional	 (2D)	 architecture	 involving	 vertical	 integration	 of	 van	 der	
Waals	 (vW)	 materials	 has	 been	 explored	 as	 a	 platform	 for	 the	 future	 semiconductor	
technology1-3.	Hybrid	devices	consisting	of	physically	stacked	layers	of	MoS2	and	other	vW	
materials	has	also	been	explored	for	various	device	applications;	MoS2/Graphene	interface	
for	 improved	 electrical	 contacts4,5,	 MoS2/h-BN	 hybrid	 systems	 for	 mobility	 engineering3,5	
and	 electrostatic	 confinement6-8,	 MoS2/WSe2	 PN-junction2	 have	 been	 reported.	 	 	 Rather

is	 an	

for	

Among	the	reported	structural	phases,	2H,	2H’	and	3R	are	semiconductors,	1T’	is	a	
narrow	bandgap	semiconductor	and	1T	is	metallic9-12.	The	2H	is	the	most	widely	explored	
phase	 for	 device	 applications5,13-17.	 	 The	 1T	 phase	 has	 recently	 gained	 attention	 as	 a	
candidate	 for	 energy	 storage18-20,	 hydrogen	 evolution21-23,	 gas	 sensing22,24	 and	 as	 a	 low-
resistance	 electrical	 contact	 for	 2H	 MoS2	 devices25.	 The	 2H	 phase	 belongs	 to	 the	 space	
group	 !6#$$%	 with	 a	 trigonal	 prismatic	 coordination	 between	 Mo	 and	 S	 atoms	 and	 1T	
belongs	 to	 !3$	 space	 group	 with	 an	 octahedral	 coordination	 between	 the	 Mo	 and	 S	
atoms26.	 The	 possibility	 of	 controllably	 and	 selectively	 engineering	 metallic	 1T	 MoS2	
regions	starting	from	the	semiconducting	2H	MoS2	provides	a	new	route	for	monolithic	2D	
circuits.	

2H	to	1T	phase	transition	happens	via	relative	gliding	of	the	Mo	and	S	planes12,27.		The	
transition	 has	 been	 achieved	 using	 alkali	 metal	 or	 hydrogen	 intercalation11,18,25,27-30,	
substitutional	 doping	 by	 Re	 atom31,	 annealing	 accompanied	 energetic	 electron-beam	
irradiation12,32,	 plasmonic	 hot	 electrons33	 and	 Argon	 plasma34.	 Intercalation	 gives	 a	
mixture	 of	 1T,	 1T’	 and	 2H	 phases11,22,30,35.	 The	 1T	 phase	 thus	 obtained	 is	 reported	 to	 be	
thermodynamically	 unstable	 and	 relaxes	 to	 1T’	 or	 2H	 over	 time	 or	 above	 a	 temperature	
range	 of	 150	 °C,	 which	 is	 in	 the	 range	 of	 standard	 sample	 processing	 temperatures	 for	
device	applications26,31,35-38.	The	recent	report	on	the	solution	phase	synthesis	of	1T	MoS2,	
in	large	concentrations,	from	the	2H	phase	yielded	only	nanosheets	and,	is	not	suitable	for	
scalable	 device	 fabrication	 schemes23.	 The	 phase	 conversion	 using	 Argon	 plasma	 yields	
predominantly	the	2H	phase	and	the	concentration	of	1T	phase	is	around	40%34.	1T	MoS2	
obtained	by	high-energy	electron	bombardment	in	a	transmission	electron	microscope	falls	
short	in	the	yield	and	in	the	adaptability	required	for	the	microelectronics	industry.	

There	 is	 a	 lack	 of	 an	 in-depth	 electrical	 characterization	 of	 metallic	 1T	 MoS2.	 Existing	
reports	confine	to	two-probe	(2P)	transport	measurements	on	polymorphic	samples11,25,34.	

	
	
	
	
A	 four-probe	 (4P)	 electrical	 characterization	 is	 essential	 since	 2P	 measurements	 are	
influenced	by	the	behaviour	of	contacts.	A	linear	current-voltage	(I-V)	characteristics,	void	
of	 gate-voltage	 dependence,	 down	 to	 the	 cryogenic	 temperatures	 is	 necessary	 in	
establishing	a	metallic	nature.	The	1T	samples	obtained	by	Argon	plasma34	treatment	have	
shown	 response	 to	 gate	 voltages,	 atypical	 of	 a	 metallic	 state	 and,	 in	 contrast	 to	 those	
reported	 elsewhere11,25.	 Temperature	 dependent	 transport	 measurements	 are	 reported	
only	 down	 to	 100	 K,	 however,	 the	 sample	 shows	 a	 large	 increase	 in	 the	 resistance	 as	 the	
temperature	is	lowered11.		

In	this	manuscript,	we	demonstrate	a	method	to	create	large	area	1T	MoS2	sheets,	from	
bulk	 exfoliated	 2H	 MoS2	 samples	 with	 arbitrary	 thickness	 and	 area,	 in	 a	 controllable	 and	
scalable	manner.	Our	process	involves	treating	mechanically	exfoliated	samples	with	high-
power	 forming-gas	 microwave	 plasma	 which	 results	 in	 a	 layer-by-layer	 thinning	
accompanied	 by	 a	 structural	 phase	 conversion	 from	 2H	 to	 1T.	 The	 presence	 of	 plasma	
etching	helps	us	to	realize	large-area	few-layer	1T	MoS2	samples	starting	from	large-area	
thicker	exfoliated	samples.	We	show	that	our	technique	can	be	used	to	selectively	engineer	
the	 1T	 phase	 on	 2H	 MoS2	 samples	 with	 the	 help	 of	 standard	 lithography	 techniques.	 We	
perform	 an	 in-depth	 structural	 characterization	 using	 high-resolution	 transmission	
electron	 microscopy	 (HR-TEM)	 and	 Raman	 spectroscopy.	 Unlike	 the	 intercalation	 route,	
our	process	is	faster	and	we	do	not	find	signatures	of	1T’	or	1T”	phases.	Our	process	yields	
extended	1T	regions	with	an	areal	coverage	in	excess	of	70	%	over	the	2H	phase.	The	1T	
samples	 show	 a	 temporal	 stability	 in	 excess	 of	 a	 few	 weeks	 and	 a	 thermal	 stability	 up	 to	
300°	C	in	ambience.	We	conduct	2P	transport	studies	on	lithographically	defined	2H	and	1T	
regions	 on	 the	 same	 sample	 for	 a	 direct	 comparison	 of	 electrical	 properties.	 We	 also	
perform	4P	electrical	transport	studies	on	a	few	layer	1T	MoS2	sample.	The	contacts	on	the	
1T	phase	show	a	clear	Ohmic	behaviour	at	all	temperatures	from	300	K	down	to	4	K	and	
the	 transport	 show	 little	 response	 to	 the	 gate	 voltage,	 indicative	 of	 a	 metallic	 phase.	 We	
also	observe	negligible	temperature	coefficient	of	resistance	down	to	4	K	for	the	1T	phase	
11,	ruling	out	hoping-mediated	or	activated	transport	in	our	
unlike	other	reports	on	1T	MoS2
samples.	

Experimental	methods	

The	MoS2	samples	with	various	thickness	are	mechanically	exfoliated	from	bulk	crystals	
and	 transferred	 onto	 Silicon	 substrates	 hosting	 a	 300	 nm	 thermally	 grown	 silicon-oxide	
layer	 using	 the	 PDMS	 dry	 stamping	 technique39.	 The	 thickness	 of	 the	 flakes	 is	 estimated	
using	 the	 red-channel	 optical	 contrast	 method40.	 These	 samples	 are	 treated	 with	 forming	
gas	 (10%	 H2+90%	 Ar)	 microwave	 plasma	 with	 40%	 input	 power	 to	 the	 magnetron.	 The	
plasma	 treatment	 results	 in	 a	 layer-by-layer	 etching	 of	 the	 sample	 accompanied	 by	 a	
structural	 phase	 transformation	 from	 the	 2H	 to	 the	 1T	 phase.	 Technical	 details	 of	 the	

	
	
	
microwave	plasma	reactor	is	given	elsewhere40.	Lower	microwave	power	levels	result	only	
in	a	layer-by-layer	etching	and	do	not	yield	any	phase	change.	

The	HR-TEM	analysis	of	the	samples	are	carried	out	using	FEI	Tecnai	FEG30	E	Spirit	
transmission	electron	microscope	with	an	accelerating	voltage	of	200	kV.	The	samples	are	
transferred	 onto	 a	 TEM	 grid	 from	 the	 Si/SiO2	 substrate	 using	 the	 PMMA	 transfer	
technique41.	The	Raman	and	photoluminescence	(PL)	spectra	are	recorded	using	a	Horiba	
XploRA	PLUS	Raman	microscope	using	a	laser	of	wavelength	532	nm	with	a	power	of	1.5	
mW.	

For	 selective	 area	 phase	 conversion,	 we	 exploit	 a	 lithographically	 defined	 Aluminium	
mask	 during	 plasma	 treatment.	 Post	 plasma	 treatment,	 the	 mask	 is	 removed	 using	 0.1	 N	
NaOH	solution.	Field	effect	transistors	are	fabricated	for	exploring	the	electrical	properties	
of	the	material;	MoS2	film	acts	as	the	channel,	while	the	highly	doped	silicon	substrate	and	
the	 silicon	 oxide	 layer	 serves	 as	 the	 back-gate	 and	 the	 gate-dielectric	 respectively.	 The	
source	 and	 the	 drain	 contacts	 are	 defined	 using	 standard	 electron-beam	 or	 photo	
lithography	followed	by	Cr/Au	metallization.	The	transport	measurements	are	performed	
in	high	vacuum	(<10-6	mbar)	dark	environment	in	a	closed-cycle	cryostat.	

Results	&	Discussion	

TEM	analysis	

The	crystallinity	of	the	plasma	treated	samples	is	examined	using	HR-TEM.	Fig.	1(a)	
shows	 HR-TEM	 image	 of	 a	 representative	 plasma	 treated	 few-layer	 MoS2	 sample.	 The	
regions	shaded	in	purple,	green	and	brown	represent	the	2H,	1T	and,	an	intermediate	state	
between	the	2H	and	the	1T	phases	respectively.	From	the	HR-TEM	analysis	conducted	over	
many	samples	we	estimate	an	areal	coverage	in	excess	of	70	%	for	the	1T	phase	opposed	to	
that	of	the	2H	phase.	We	also	note	that	the	HR-TEM	images	do	not	show	signatures	of	other	
structural	phases	such	as	1T’	or	1T”.	The	selected	area	electron	diffraction	(SAED)	pattern	
shown	in	the	top-right	inset	exhibit	sharp	diffraction	spots,	inferring	good	crystallinity	of	
our	 samples.	 HR-TEM	 images	 of	 two	 more	 samples	 showing	 extended	 1T	 regions	 are	
shown	in	supporting	information	S1.	

Fig.	1(b)	shows	a	magnified	image	of	the	2H	region	while	Fig.	1	(c)	shows	that	of	the	
1T	region	obtained	from	the	same	sample	as	in	Fig.	1	(a).	The	lower	panels	in	Fig.	1(b)	and

phases	 are	 shown	 in	 the	 overlaid	 diagrams	 in	 Fig.	 1	 (b)	 and	 (c)	 respectively.	 In	 the	 2H	
phase	the	S-Mo-S	atoms	are	arranged	in	an	A-B-A	stacking	fashion	along	the	c	-	axis.		Mo	
atoms	appear	brighter	in	intensity	compared	to	the	S	atoms	in	the	TEM	images	owing	to	its

higher	atomic	number42.	Due	to	this	reason,	the	intensity	for	the	S-peaks	is	very	weak	for	
monolayer	 MoS2.	 For	 a	 few-layer	 2H	 MoS2,	 the	 position	 of	 S	 atoms	 in	 one	 layer	 coincides	
with	that	of	the	Mo	atoms	in	the	adjacent	layer.	This	gives	an	appreciable	intensity	for	the	
peaks	 corresponding	 to	 the	 S	 sites43,	 as	 evident	 from	 the	 intensity	 profile	 shown	 in	 the	

	
bottom	 panel	 of	 Fig.	 1	 (b).	 We	 extract	 a	 nearest	 Mo-Mo	 separation	 of	 3.19	 (+/-	 0.08)	 A0	
from	the	HR-TEM	images.	

In	the	1T	phase,	the	Mo	atom	is	octahedrally	coordinated	with	six	S	atoms	with	the	
S-Mo-S	 in	 an	 ABC	 stacking	 fashion.	 In	 this	 case,	 atoms	 in	 one	 layer	 align	 with	 the	
corresponding	 atoms	 in	 the	 adjacent	 layer.	 This	 arrangement	 makes	 the	 intensity	 of	 the	
peaks	corresponding	to	the	S	atoms	in	1T	phase	much	weaker	compared	to	that	of	the	2H	
phase	 in	 the	 TEM	 images.	 As	 seen	 in	 the	 bottom	 panel	 of	 Fig.	 1	 (c)	 there	 are	 two	 small	
peaks	corresponding	to	the	Sulphur	atoms	in	the	top	and	bottom	plane	(S	and	S’)	while	the	
peaks	 for	 Mo	 atoms	 are	 clearly	 visible.	 For	 the	 1T	 phase	 the	 Mo	 atoms	 form	 a	 hexagonal	
lattice	as	shown	in	Fig.	1(c).	We	obtain	a	mean	nearest	Mo-Mo	separation	of	3.19	(+/-	0.04)	
A0	 from	 line-profiles	 taken	 along	 different	 directions	 in	 the	 (001)	 plane	 [Supporting	
Information	S2].	These	values	are	in	good	agreement	with	the	reported	ones44.	We	rule	out	
the	presence	of	any	1T’	or	1T”	phases	where	Mo-Mo	separations	are	unequal	in	different	
directions,	as	observed	elsewhere45.	

Fig.	1	(d)	shows	a	magnified	HR-TEM	image	of	a	region	where	the	2H	and	1T	phases	
intersect.	 The	 lower	 panel	 shows	 intensity	 line-profile	 taken	 along	 the	 direction	
represented	 by	 the	 dashed-line	 in	 the	 main	 panel	 of	 Fig.	 1	 (d).	 2H	 and	 the	 1T	 regions	
exhibit	 intensity	 profiles	 similar	 to	 Fig.	 1	 (b)	 and	 (c)	 respectively.	 We	 also	 note	 that	 the	
relative	 intensity	 of	 the	 Mo	 peaks	 in	 the	 1T	 region	 is	 higher	 than	 that	 of	 the	 2H	 region;	
possibly	 due	 to	 the	 difference	 in	 the	 alignment	 of	 Mo	 atoms,	 corresponding	 to	 different	
layers,	along	the	c-axis.	

The	 transformation	 between	 the	 2H	 and	 the	 1T	 phases	 involves	 an	 intra-layer	 S	
plane	gliding12,27.	For	a	few	layer	MoS2	sample,	transition	between	the	2H	and	1T	phases	
also	 require	 an	 Mo-plane	 gliding.	 In	 support	 of	 this	 we	 observe	 in	 a	 few	 of	 our	 HR-TEM	
images,	an	intermediate	atomic	arrangement	between	the	2H	and	the	1T	phases,	as	shown	
in	Fig.	1(e).		The	visible	stripe-like	patterns	in	Fig.	1	(e)	is	due	to	the	rearrangement	of	Mo	
and	 S	 atoms	 during	 the	 transformation28.	 A	 possible	 atomic	 arrangement	 is	 shown	 in	 the	
inset	to	Fig.	1(e).		

We	also	examine	HR-TEM	image	of	a	pristine	2H	MoS2	sample	taken	with	the	same	
exposure	parameters	as	those	for	the	1T	samples.	Fig.	1	(f)	shows	the	HR-TEM	image	and	
the	 inset	 shows	 a	 magnified	 view	 of	 the	 Mo	 and	 S	 atomic	 arrangements	 depicting	 the	 2H	
phase.	 The	 images	 did	 not	 show	 presence	 of	 any	 other	 structural	 phases	 confirming	 the	
absence	of	electron-beam	induced	2H	to	1T	phase	transition	in	our	samples.	

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Raman	&	PL	studies	

We	 perform	 Raman	 scattering	 and	 PL	 studies	 on	 plasma	 treated	 samples.	 These	
samples	consist	of	regions	with	different	thickness	starting	from	a	few	nanometres	to	a	few		
tens	 of	 nanometres	 prior	 to	 the	 plasma	 treatment.	 Fig.	 2	 (a)	 shows	 optical	 images	 of	 a	
representative	sample	where	the	top	panel	shows	the	pristine	exfoliated	sample	while	the

bottom	panel	shows	the	image	after	a	7.5	minutes	of	plasma	treatment.	We	have	conducted	
Raman	scattering	studies	on	all	the	regions.	Here	we	focus	on	regions	labelled	I	and	II.	Fig.	
2(b)	[Fig.	2	(c)]	shows	the	Raman	spectra	from	region	I	[region	II].		The	black(red)	traces	in	
both	Fig.	2(b)	and	(c)	represent	Raman	spectra	taken	before(after)	the	plasma	treatment.	
Samples	 post-plasma	 treatment	 (red	 traces)	 show	 clear	 J1	 and	 J2	 vibrational	 modes	
corresponding	to	the	1T	phase	(The	Raman	scattering	studies	conducted	on	other	regions	
are	shown	in	Supporting	Information	S3).		

To	 demonstrate	 the	 controllability	 and	 scalability	 of	 the	 process	 we	 use	 the	
Aluminium	 masking	 technique	 to	 selectively	 phase	 engineer	 the	 sample.	 Fig.	 2	 (d)	 shows	
optical	 images	 of	 the	 sample	 before	 (top)	 and	 after	 (bottom)	 the	 plasma	 treatment.	 The	
centre	 region	 (labelled	 I)	 on	 the	 bottom	 panel	 of	 Fig.	 2	 (d)	 is	 masked	 and	 the	 remaining	
area	is	treated	with	the	plasma	and	etched	down	to	a	thickness	of	~	6	layers	of	MoS2.	Fig.	2	
(e)	shows	the	PL	spectra	of	the	sample	before	(black)	and	PL	spectra	from	region	II	after	
(red)	the	plasma	treatment.	The	sample	is	in	excess	of	~	50	nm	in	thickness	prior	to	plasma	
treatment	and	exhibits	only	a	weak	excitonic	peak	(black	trace).	The	plasma	treated	region	
(II),	 reduced	 to	 6	 layers	 in	 thickness,	 does	 not	 exhibit	 any	 PL	 (red	 trace)	 in	 contrast	 to	 a	
pristine	six-layer	2H	MoS2	shown	in	blue-trace46.	Raman	spectra	of	the	sample	before	and	
after	 the	 plasma	 treatment	 are	 shown	 in	 the	 inset.	 Only	 region	 II,	 exposed	 to	 the	 plasma,	
develops	the	J1	and	the	J2	peaks	(red	trace)	while	the	Raman	spectra	of	region	I	post	plasma	
treatment	 (purple	 trace)	 is	 akin	 to	 that	 of	 the	 sample	 prior	 to	 the	 plasma	 treatment.	 The	
quenching	 of	 the	 PL	 spectra,	 post	 plasma	 treatment,	 as	 a	 result	 of	 a	 semiconducting	 to	
metallic	phase	transition	is	shown	in	Fig.	2	(f).	The	optical	images	of	the	sample	before	and	
after	 plasma	 treatment	 is	 shown	 in	 the	 insets.	 The	 black-trace	 shows	 the	 PL	 spectra

obtained	from	region	I	(~	6	layers)	and	the	red	trace	shows	the	PL	spectra	from	the	same	
region	after	the	plasma	treatment	(~	4	layers).	While	the	PL	spectra	undergo	a	substantial	
quenching,	 the	 Raman	 spectra,	 shown	 in	 the	 inset,	 develop	 the	 characteristics	 J1	 and	 J2	
peaks	as	a	result	of	the	plasma	treatment.	

Post	plasma	treatment,	our	samples	exhibit	clear	J1	and	J2	peaks	while	the	J3	peak	is	
very	weak	in	intensity.	In	addition,	we	observe	emergence	of	a	peak	at	180	cm-1	which	was		
not	reported	in	the	past.	The	J1	and	the	J3	peaks	are	predicted	to	be	much	lower	in	intensity	
compared	to	the	J2	peak47.	The	relative	intensities	and	the	peak	positions	vary	from	sample	
to	sample	and	process	to	process20,29,32,34,48.	1T	MoS2	prepared	by	chemical	routes	exhibit	a	
29,48.	 1T	 MoS2	 prepared	 by	 physical	 routes	 exhibit	 strong	 J2	 while	 the	 J3	 is	 very	
weaker	 J3
weak.		Both	the	J1	and	J2	peaks	are	clearly	visible	on	electron-beam	irradiated	and	Argon	RF	
plasma	treated	samples	while	J3	is	not	well	formed32,34.		

Now	we	discuss	the	stability	of	the	phase	engineered	1T	samples.	Fig.	3	(a)	shows	
the	 optical	 images	 of	 the	 sample	 before	 and	 after	 plasma	 treatment.	 Raman	 spectra	 from	
the	region	I	of	the	sample	before	(black-trace)	and	after	(red-trace)	the	plasma	treatment	is	
shown	in	Fig.	3	(b).	The	green-trace	shows	Raman	spectra	obtained	from	the	same	region	
after	keeping	the	sample	for	27	days	at	ambient	temperature	and	pressure.	Both	the	red-
trace	 and	 the	 green-trace	 show	 J1,	 J2	 and	 J3	 peaks	 with	 similar	 shape	 and	 intensity	
suggesting	 good	 temporal	 stability	 of	 our	 samples.	 We	 also	 note	 here	 that	 the	 HR-TEM	
images	 taken	 after	 30	 days	 of	 plasma	 treatment	 also	 show	 rich	 concentration	 of	 the	 1T	
phase	suggesting	good	temporal	stability	of	our	samples.		

Now	 we	 explore	 the	 stability	 of	 the	 1T	 samples	 as	 a	 function	 of	 annealing	
temperature.	Fig.	3	(c)	shows	the	PL	spectra	taken	from	the	region	labelled	I	of	the	sample	
shown	 in	 Fig.	 2	 (f)	 post	 plasma	 treatment	 at	 room	 temperature	 (red-trace),	 annealed	 at	
300°	 C	 for	 5	 min	 (cyan-trace)	 and	 15	 min	 (magenta-trace).	 The	 black	 trace	 shows	 the	 PL	
spectra	of	the	same	region,	~	6	layers	in	thickness,	prior	to	the	plasma	treatment.	The	inset	
shows	Raman	spectra	of	region	I	at	room	temperature	(red),	annealed	at	300°		C	for	5	min	
(cyan)	and	for	15	min	(magenta).	We	infer	from	the	PL	and	Raman	spectra	evolution	that	
our	1T	samples	are	stable	up	to	300°		C	in	temperature,	which	is	well	above	the	range	of	
temperatures	 for	 standard	 device	 fabrication	 processes.	 As	 evident	 from	 the	 HR-TEM	
images	our	samples	also	contains	regions	in	2H	phase	which	might	be	providing	stability	to	
the	1T	phase32.	

Transport	studies		

Electrical	transport	studies	are	conducted	on	two	kinds	of	devices.	(1)	On	a	device	
where	a	1T	region	is	lithographically	defined	on	a	pristine	2H	MoS2,	for	a	direct	comparison	

	
	
	
	
	
of	electrical	properties	of	both	phases	on	the	same	sample.	(2)	On	a	fully	phase	engineered	
1T	MoS2	device.		

Fig.	 4	 (a)	 shows	 the	 optical	 image	 of	 the	 sample	 on	 which	 the	 central	 region	
enclosed	 between	 the	 dashed-	 lines	 (labelled	 2H)	 is	 covered	 using	 a	 lithographically	
defined	 Al	 mask,	 and	 the	 flanked	 regions	 labelled	 1T	 are	 exposed	 to	 the	 plasma	 and	
converted	to	the	1T	phase.	Post	plasma	treatment	the	mask	is	removed	using	NaOH	(0.1	N)	
and	Cr/Au	source	and	drain	contacts	are	fabricated	onto	both	the	1T	and	the	2H	regions.		
The	 Raman	 spectra	 of	 the	 1T	 region	 shown	 in	 the	 Supporting	 Information	 S4	 exhibit	 the	
signature	peaks,	the	J1,	J2	and	J3,	of	1T	phase.	Fig.	4	(b)	shows	the	2P	I-V	characteristics	of	
the	 2H	 region	 at	 300	 K	 (red	 trace),	 77	 K	 (green	 trace)	 and	 4	 K	 (blue	 trace).	 The	 I-V	
characteristics	 of	 the	 2H-region	 exhibit	 a	 Schottky	 behaviour	 at	 all	 temperatures	 and	 the	

Figure	 4:	 (a)	 Optical	 image	 of	 a	 selectively	 phase	 engineered	 sample.	 The	 region	 labelled	 2H	 is	
masked	and	the	regions	labelled	1T	are	exposed	during	plasma	treatment.	(b)	&	(c)	I-V	curves	from	
2H	&	1T	regions	respectively;	4	K	(blue),	77	K	(green)	and	300	K	(red).	Insets	show	conductance	of	
the	corresponding	regions	as	a	function	of	Vbg	at	4	K	(blue)	and	300	K	(red).	(d)	Optical	image	of	a	~	
8	nm	thick	phase	engineered	1T	MoS2	sample	with	photo-lithographed	electrical	contacts,	scale	bar	
is	20	µm.	(e)	4P	I-V	characteristics	of	the	sample	at	300	K	(red)	and	4	K	(blue),	shown	in	(d);	probes

sensing.	The	Inset	shows	the	resistance	vs	Vbg	at	300	K	(red)	and	4	K	(blue).	(f)	2P	I-V	characteristics	
of	the	sample,	shown	in	(d),	taken	across	the	probes	8	&	9	(blue)	and	7	&	13	(cyan)	at	4K,	showing	
a	clear	Ohmic	behaviour.	The	inset	shows	Hall	resistance	of	the	sample	at	4	K.		

	
	
span	of	the	non-linearity	increases	as	the	temperature	is	lowered	down	to	4K.	We	note	that	
Cr/Au	contacted	MoS2	generally	exhibit	non-linear	I-V	characteristics13,40,	which	has	been	
verified	 by	 us	 independently	 (data	 not	 shown).	 The	 inset	 to	 Fig.	 4	 (b)	 shows	 the	 2P	
conductance	of	the	2H	region	as	a	function	of	the	back-gate	voltage,	Vbg,	at	300	K	(red	trace)	
and	4K	(blue	trace).	The	device	exhibits	clear	n-type	behaviour	with	a	field	effect	mobility	
of	 16.4	 cm2/V-s	 at	 300	 K	 and	 84	 cm2/V-s	 at	 4	 K,	 which	 are	 in	 the	 range	 of	 typically	
observed	mobility	values	for	an	uncapped,	back-gated	2H	MoS2	FET49.	In	contrast,	the	I-V	
characteristics	of	the	plasma	treated	region	1T,	shown	in	Fig.	2(c),	exhibits	excellent	Ohmic	
behaviour	 at	 all	 temperatures	 down	 to	 4K.	 The	 inset	 shows	 the	 conductance	 of	 the	 1T	
region	as	a	function	of	Vbg.	The	device	shows	little	change	in	conductance	as	Vbg	is	varied	in	
a	large	voltage	range	of	-20	to	40	V	at	300	K	(red	trace)	and	-10	to	20V	at	4K	(blue	trace).	
We	 also	 note	 that	 the	 2P	 resistance	 of	 the	 1T	 region	 shows	 only	 a	 small	 change	 (~	 12	
Ohms)	as	the	sample	was	cooled	down	to	4K	from	300	K	while	that	of	the	2H	region	shows	
a	large	variation	in	excess	of	three	orders	in	magnitude.		We	have	conducted	2P	transport	
measurements	on	a	monolayer	phase	engineered	1T	MoS2	sample	and	verified	the	linear	I-
V	 characteristics	 and	 the	 absence	 of	 back-gate	 voltage	 dependence	 on	 conductance	
independently	[Supporting	Information	S5].	

To	 exclude	 any	 contribution	 from	 the	 contact	 resistance	 to	 the	 electrical	
characteristics	 we	 conduct	 4P	 transport	 measurements	 on	 an	 ~	 8	 nm	 thick	 1T	 phase	
engineered	 sample.	 The	 optical	 image	 of	 the	 device	 is	 shown	 in	 Fig.	 	 4(d).	 The	 4P	 I-V	
characteristics	of	the	sample	at	300	K	(red	trace)	and	4	K	(blue	trace)	are	shown	in	Fig.	4	
(e).	The	I-V	characteristics	show	clear	Ohmic	behaviour	down	to	4	K.	We	observe	a	feeble	
change	 in	 the	 resistance	 as	 the	 device	 is	 cooled	 down	 to	 4K;	 we	 extract	 a	 temperature	
coefficient	of	resistance,	' = −1.1057×1001203	using	the	equation	45 = 4#667 1 + '	Δ; .		
The	inset	shows	the	four-probe	conductance	of	the	device	as	a	function	of	Vbg.	Both	at	300	
K	 (red	 trace)	 and	 at	 4	 K	 (blue	 trace)	 the	 conductance	 of	 the	 device	 does	 not	 show	 any	
response	 to	 Vbg	 for	 a	 large	 range	 of	 voltage.	 Fig.	 4	 (e)	 shows	 2P	 I-V	 characteristics	 of	 the	
voltage	(8	&	9)	and	current	(7	&	13)	probes	of	the	device	at	4	K,	both	exhibiting	excellent	
linearity.	 From	 the	 4P	 resistance	 we	 extract	 a	 sheet	 resistance	 =	 108	 W/(cid:0).	 A	 carrier	
concentration	of	~	2.3	X	1015	cm-2	is	extracted	from	the	Hall	resistance	shown	in	the	inset	
to	Fig.	4	(e).	We	note	here	that	the	carrier	concentration	obtained	for	our	1T	samples	are	
higher	by	two	orders	of	magnitude	compared	to	that	of	back-gated	2H	MoS2	samples13	and	
higher	 approximately	 by	 an	 order	 compared	 to	 that	 of	 the	 ionic-liquid-gated	 2H	 MoS2	
samples50.	

Conclusions	&	discussions	

In	 this	 manuscript,	 we	 demonstrated	 a	 controllable	 and	 scalable	 2H	 to	 1T	 phase	
conversion	 technique	 for	 MoS2.	 	 The	 process	 involves	 treating	 exfoliated	 2H	 MoS2	 of	
arbitrary	 thickness	 with	 forming-gas	 microwave	 plasma.	 We	 performed	 an	 in-depth	

	
	
structural	analysis	using	HR-TEM	and	Raman	microscopy.	Our	processed	samples	consist	
of	70%	of	1T	phase.	We	did	not	find	presence	of	other	commonly	observed	phases	such	as	
1T’or	1T”.	The	HR-TEM	images	showed	clear	signatures	of	Mo	and	S	atomic	plane	gliding	
revealing	 the	 mechanism	 of	 the	 phase	 transition.	 We	 observed	 the	 evolution	 of	 the	
signature	 Raman	 peaks	 of	 1T	 MoS2	 accompanied	 by	 quenching	 of	 the	 PL	 on	 plasma	
treatment,	 indicative	 of	 a	 metallic	 phase	 formation.	 Our	 1T	 samples	 withstood	 aging	 for	
more	than	a	month	and	also	showed	a	thermal	stability	up	to	300˚C,	making	it	suitable	for	
standard	device	fabrication	techniques.	We	demonstrated	lateral	monolithic	integration	of	
metallic	 1T	 and	 semiconducting	 2H	 phases	 with	 the	 help	 of	 standard	 lithography	
techniques.	 We	 have	 conducted	 extensive	 transport	 characterization	 of	 our	 1T	 samples	
from	 300	 K	 down	 to	 4	 K.	 Both	 the	 2P	 and	 the	 4P	 I-V	 characteristics	 showed	 excellent	
linearity	down	to	4K	and	did	not	exhibit	any	response	to	the	back-gate	for	a	large	span	of	
voltage.	 Our	 1T	 samples	 showed	 carrier	 concentration	 a	 few	 orders	 higher	 and	 the	
resistance	 considerably	 lower	 than	 that	 of	 the	 2H	 samples.	 	 A	 linear	 I-V	 characteristic,	
without	 gate-voltage	 dependence	 suggests	 the	 presence	 of	 a	 metallic	 state	 and	 Schottky-
barrier-free	source	and	the	drain	contacts51,52.	The	feeble	temperature	dependence	shown	
by	the	1T	samples	from	300	K	down	to	4K	also	negates	any	barrier	formation	at	the	source	
and	 drain	 contacts53.	 The	 negligible	 temperature	 dependence	 also	 rules	 out	 any	 hoping	
mediated	and	activated	transport	in	our	system	and	suggests	that	the	samples	consists	of	
extended	1T	regions	as	evident	from	the	HR-TEM	analysis;	transport	on	polymorphic	MoS2	
had	 shown	 strong	 	 temperature	 dependence	 due	 to	 hopping	 transport	 between	 1T	
islands11.	The	weak	temperature	dependence	could	also	be	due	to	the	phonon-decoupling	
effect	as	observed	elsewhere54.	Scalability	and	compatibility	with	planar	device	fabrication	
schemes,	high	yield,	and	stability	of	the	samples	can	make	this	process	a	promising	tool	for	
2D	microelectronics	industry.
