Abstract: The ALICE muon trigger (MTR) system consists of 72 Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC)
detectors arranged in two stations, each composed of two planes with 18 RPCs per plane. The
detectors are operated in maxi-avalanche mode using a mixture of 89.7% C2H2F4, 10% i-C4H10
and 0.3% SF6. A number of detector performance indicators, such as eﬃciency and dark current,
have been monitored over time throughout the LHC Run2 (2015-18). While the eﬃciency showed
very good stability, a steady increase in the absorbed dark current was observed.

Since the end of 2018, the LHC has entered a phase of long shutdown, during which the ALICE
experiment will be upgraded to cope with the next phase of data taking, expected in 2021. The
MTR is undergoing a major upgrade of the front-end and readout electronics, and will change its
functionalities, becoming a Muon Identiﬁer [1]. Only the replacement of the most irradiated RPCs
is planned during the upgrade. It is therefore important to perform dedicated studies to gain further
insights into the status of the detector. In particular, two RPCs were ﬂushed with pure Ar gas for
a prolonged period of time and a plasma was created by fully ionizing the gas. The output gas
was analyzed using a Gas Chromatograph combined with a Mass Spectrometer and the possible
presence of ﬂuorinated compounds originating from the interaction of the plasma with the detector
inner surfaces has been assessed using an Ion-Selective Electrode station.

This contribution will include a detailed review of the ALICE muon RPC performance at the

LHC; the procedure and results of the argon plasma test, described above, are also discussed.

A Large Ion Collider Experiment [2] (ALICE) is one of the four main experiments located at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is specialized in the study of ultra-relativistic nucleus-
nucleus collisions and it investigates the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy
densities, where the formation of the Quark Gluon Plasma [3] (QGP) takes place.

ALICE is equipped with a muon spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity interval -4<𝜂<-2.5,
whose primary aim is the measurement of muons from heavy ﬂavours (hadrons containing a quark
charm or beauty) and quarkonia (bound states 𝑐 ¯𝑐 and 𝑏 ¯𝑏).

The muon spectrometer is composed of a set of two absorbers (whose function is to reduce
the ﬂux of charged hadrons on the spectrometer), a tracking system made of ten detection planes,
a dipole magnet and a set of four planes of single-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) used to
provide a trigger signal for the muon spectrometer.

2 The muon trigger system

A detailed description of the muon spectrometer can be found in [2]. The muon trigger system [4]
(MTR) is composed of a total of 72 single-gap RPCs, arranged in two stations (located at ∼16 and
17 m from the interaction point) with two detector planes in each (18 RPCs per plane). The gas
gap is 2 mm thick, the electrodes are made out of low-resistivity (109-1010 Ω·cm) bakelite and are
2 mm thick as well. The total active area per detection plane is ∼5.5x6.5 m2. The detectors are
operated in the so-called maxiavalanche mode (average charge per hit of ∼100 pC/hit [5–7]) with
the following gas mixture: 89.7% C2H2F4, 10% i-C4H10 and 0.3% SF6. The working voltage is set
to values between 10 and 10.5 kV depending on the RPC. The detectors are read out by means of
orthogonal copper strips and the signals are discriminated by the ADULT [8] front-end electronics,
which has no ampliﬁcation stage and threshold set to 7 mV.

3 Performance of the ALICE MTR

The ALICE experiment is operating since 2010. The data taking took place in two phases: the RUN
1 (2010-2013) and RUN 2 (2015-2018). During the operations, ALICE has taken data in diﬀerent
colliding systems: proton-proton (pp), proton-lead (p-Pb), lead-lead (Pb-Pb) and, for a very short
period of time, xenon-xenon (Xe-Xe). The center of mass energies and integrated luminosities
for the RUN 2 data taking period are reported in table 1. The maximum instantaneous luminosity
𝑠=13 TeV, 1.5·1029
values are about 1031 Hz/cm2 for pp at
Hz/cm2 for p-Pb and 1027 Hz/cm2 for Pb-Pb [9].

The charge integrated by the RPCs has been monitored since the beginning of operations, using
continuous current measurements after dark current subtraction. The latter is deﬁned as the current
absorbed by the detectors when they are not irradiated (i.e. due to intrinsic noise and cosmic rays)
and is estimated through dedicated cosmic rays runs. The left panel of ﬁgure 2 shows the trend of
integrated charge for the MT 22 detection plane (see ﬁgure 1) as a function of time. Three curves
are shown: one for the average integrated charge, and two for the RPCs that had accumulated the
highest and the lowest amount of charge by the end of RUN 2. The MT 22 plane was chosen as an
example because it was the one which, on average, accumulated the greatest amount of charge (∼11
mC/cm2). Aging tests [5] certiﬁed RPC operation with the ALICE gas mixture up to ∼ 50 mC/cm2
of integrated charge.

The RPC eﬃciency is constantly monitored, to ensure that the detectors are working as expected
and is an input for eﬃciency corrections in data analysis. In the right panel of ﬁgure 2 the trend
of the average eﬃciency for the MT 22 detection plane is shown for the whole Run 2. The curve

– 2 –

in red refers to the non-bending plane, while the black one to the bending plane. Bending and
non-bending refer to the strip orientation relative to the dipole magnetic ﬁeld: the strips parallel
(perpendicular) to the magnetic ﬁeld form the bending (non-bending) plane. The Eﬃciency showed
satisfactory results for the whole detection system, being typically > 96% and stable over time. The
small ﬂuctuations are mainly due to local issues, such as noise in the front-end electronics. The
MT 22 detection plane was chosen as an example but the behavior of the other planes is similar.

The detector availability for data taking during RUN 2 was > 95% (the missing 5% also includes
those runs in which the RPCs were kept OFF due to unavailability of other detectors used for muon
physics).

Figure 2. Left panel: integrated charge trend for the MT 22 detection plane, right panel: eﬃciency trend
for the MT 22 detection plane

An increase in the average values of dark current can be observed for all four detection planes,
especially during RUN 2, as it can be seen in ﬁgure 3. This is the only sign of potential aging
shown by the system since, as stated earlier, the eﬃciency does not deteriorate over time. The
increase in absorbed dark current was observed on ∼50% of the detectors and the causes are under
investigation.

4 Test with Ar plasma

A possible explanation for the observed dark current increase is the deposition of ﬂuorinated
compounds, mainly hydroﬂuoric acid (HF), on the inner surfaces of the detectors. These compounds
are created by the recombination of F− ions (originated by the breakage of C2H2F4 molecules
following their interaction with radiation) with hydrogen, originating mainly from the water vapour
in the mixture. This compound may, at least partially, deposit on the inner surfaces of the detectors,
leading to a degradation of these surfaces and giving rise to the increase in absorbed dark current,
e.g. by chemically attacking the electrodes surface creating local spikes or by forming a thin
conductive layer [10].

Under this hypothesis, an argon plasma test [11] was executed on two of the MTR RPCs
(active area of 292x77 cm2 each): these detectors were ﬂushed with pure argon and a plasma was
created by ionizing it. A few other detectors (9) were ﬂushed with argon but without ionizing it
and the others were left untouched. The free charges ﬂowing in the plasma, as well as the photons
originating from ion-electron recombinations, may be suﬃciently energetic to detach the ﬂuorinated
compounds from the inner surfaces of the detectors and the gas ﬂow would take them out.

To conﬁrm this assumption, analyses of the exiting gas mixture were performed using a Gas
Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) combination, in order to identify the presence of
compounds potentially produced by the interaction of the plasma with the detector, and an Ion
Selective Electrode (ISE) station to identify the presence of F− ions in the exiting gas mixture. The
GC performs the separation of a given gas mixture in its components, thanks to the fact that diﬀerent
gases are trapped for diﬀerent times in the GC elements. Each gas exits the GC after a speciﬁc time
(retention time) and enters the mass spectrometer (MS) in order to be identiﬁed. Each component
of the gas mixture produces a peak in a chromatogram (the result of a GC analysis) and the area
underneath it (measured in 𝜇V·s) is proportional to the concentration of that particular element.
Figure 4 shows a scheme of the experimental apparatus.

Figure 4. Scheme of the experimental apparatus for the Ar plasma test.

A comparison between the dark current absorbed with the standard ALICE gas mixture at the
working point, before and after the Ar plasma test, was also carried out in order to assess whether
this procedure had any eﬀect on it.

4.1 F− ions production

The ISE produces a voltage signal proportional to the F− ions concentration which is then converted
into a concentration value (measured in ppm) via a calibration curve. During the Ar plasma test,
integrated measurements were carried out, meaning that the exiting gas was bubbled for a prolonged
period of time (a few hours) in 33 ml of distilled water and a measurement of the F− ions accumulated
in that period of time was done. In ﬁgure 5, the cumulative concentration of ﬂuoride ions, gathered
from diﬀerent measurements, is plotted as a function of the charge integrated during the test.

Figure 5. Trend of cumulative F− ions concentration as a function of integrated charge.

The F− concentration was measured before the beginning of the Ar plasma test and found to
be zero, while during the test the concentration was found to increase linearly with the integrated
charge. The most natural explanation is the production of ﬂuorinated compounds, due to the
interaction of the Ar plasma with the inner surfaces of the detectors. The production rate of F−
seems to be constant during the whole test, indicating that the detachment process was still ongoing
after an integrated charge of ∼2.5 mC/cm2.

4.2 Resistivity studies

When operated with pure Ar, the characteristic current-voltage (I-V) curve for an RPC has the
following features: up to ∼2000 V the Ar is not ionized and no current is circulating in the gas gap.
The gas ionizes rather quickly above 2000 V and, when it reaches full ionization, the I-V curve
follows Ohm’s law. The gas behaves like a short circuit between the two bakelite electrodes, which
can be considered as two resistors in series. From a linear ﬁt to the I-V curve it is possible to extract
the total resistance of the two bakelite electrodes and calculate the mean resistivity of the detector.

Figure 6. Left: resistivity trend for the two chambers under test

– 5 –

In ﬁgure 6, the resistivity of the two detectors under test is shown as a function of the charge
accumulated during the Ar plasma test. The resistivity, for both chambers, shows hints of an
increasing trend with the integrated charge. This might be related to a drying eﬀect that the plasma
is having either on the bakelite or on the linseed oil coating, as it is suggested in [12].

4.3 CO2 production

Besides Ar and water, already present at the input of the detectors, another compound was identiﬁed
by the GC/MS analyses, when the detectors were switched on and the plasma was created. This
was identiﬁed as CO2.

The CO2 concentration was correlated with the circulating current, as shown in ﬁgure 7: mea-
surements have been taken at diﬀerent values of current and the CO2 concentration was calculated
for each analysis. In the left portion of ﬁgure 7 all the results are shown, while in the right portion
the average values of concentration are plotted as a function of the average values of applied current.
The linear ﬁt clearly shows a correlation between the two quantities.

Figure 7. Correlation between CO2 concentration and circulating current. The values in ppm for the CO2
concentration have been obtained by means of a calibration curve.

4.4 Dark current comparison

The dark current with the standard gas mixture at the working point was measured before and after
the tests. The observed small variations are compatible with those observed for the RPCs which
were not treated.

5 Conclusions

The RPCs of the ALICE muon trigger system have shown satisfactory results during the LHC RUN
2: eﬃciency was > 96% and stable over time, detector availability was over 95%; some of the
detectors have accumulated an amount of charge close to their certiﬁed lifetime and may have to be
replaced before LHC RUN 3 [1].

An increase in the absorbed dark current was observed. In order to gain further insights on
such an increase, an argon plasma test was carried out and the following observations have been
made: (i) F− ions were present in the exiting gas mixture and their concentration was correlated
with the charge accumulated in the test, (ii) hints of an increasing trend of the RPCs resistivity, (iii)
the production of CO2 and its correlation with the circulating current, (iv) a comparison between
the dark current before and after the test showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence.
