Abstract 

In this work, we present temporally resolved measurements of electron numbers created 
at  photoionization  of  various  gases by  femtosecond  laser  pulse  at  800  nm  wavelength.  The 
experiments  were  conducted  in  O2,  Xe,  Ar,  N2,  Kr  and  CO  at  room  temperature  and 
atmospheric pressure. Elastic microwave scattering was used to directly measure the electron 
numbers. Numbers of electrons in the range 3108 to 31012 electrons were produced by the 
laser  pulse  energies  100-700  J.  After  the  laser  pulse,  plasma  decayed  on  the  time  scale 
varied from 1 to 40 ns depending on the gas type and governed by two competing processes, 
namely, the creation of new electrons from ionization of the metastable atoms and loss of the 
electrons due to dissociative recombination and attachment to oxygen. 

Introduction 

Broad  research  history  of  the  laser-induced  plasmas  is  related  to  studies  of  various 
nonlinear  effects  at  laser  beam  propagation  such  as  laser  pulse  filamentation,  laser  beam 
collapse,  self-trapping,  dispersion,  modulation  instability,  pulse  splitting  etc.1,2,3,4,5  These 
effects  are  various  manifestations  of  the  combined  action  of  focusing  Kerr  nonlinearity 
(optical  Kerr  effect)  and  defocusing  nonlinearity  due  to  plasmas.  Nowadays  laser-induced 
plasmas find very wide application for plasma-assisted combustion, combustion diagnostics, 
laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy etc. 5 

Conventional  techniques  for  diagnostics  of  laser-induced  plasmas  pose  detrimental 
limitations. Specifically, the sensitivity of laser interferometry is limited to 𝑛𝑒 1016-1017 cm-
3  due  to  the  minimal  measurable  shifts  of  the  interference  fringes.6,7,8  Numbers  of  semi-
empirical  methods  for  relative  measurements  of  plasma  density  were  proposed  as  well; 
however, all of them require absolute calibration based upon theoretically predicted values of 
plasma  number  density.  Time-of-flight  (TOF)  mass  spectrometer  measurements  of  ion 
currents generated by laser-induced plasma have been conducted to measure photoionization 
rates.1,9,10  The  measurement  relied  on  theoretical  estimation  of  total  number  of  electrons  in 
the focal zone to conduct an absolute calibration of the system. Very recently, scattering of 
THz radiation from the laser-induced plasmas was proposed for spatially unresolved relative 
measurements  of  𝑛𝑒  10,11.  Other  measurement  techniques  were  proposed  recently  based  on 
measurements  of  capacitive  response  times  of  system  including  a  capacitor  coupled  with 
laser-induced  plasma  loaded  inside.11,12,13  These  attempts  to  measure  𝑛𝑒  in  laser-induced 
plasmas are characterized by various degrees of success and reliability of obtained data, but 
none  of  them  provide  the  ultimate  solution  for  absolute  plasma  density  measurements  until 
today.

Microwave scattering enables measurement of the total number of electrons 

in the 
laser-induced plasma.14 15,16 Very recently, electron numbers generated at femtosecond-laser 
ionization  of  air  at  atmospheric  pressure  was  measured.15  The  idea  of  the  approach  is 
scattering  the  microwave  radiation  off  the  plasma  volume  in  the  quasi-Rayleigh  regime 
(denoted  as  RMS  in  the  following  description),  when  the  prolonged  plasma  volume  is 
oriented along the linearly polarized microwaves and the plasma diameter is small compared 
to  the  spatial  scale  of  the  microwave  field  so  that  the  incident  microwave  electric  field  is 
distributed  uniformly  across  the  entire  plasma  volume.  “Quasi”  is  used  to  identify  that 
scattering  is  equivalent  to  classical  Rayleigh  scattering  if  incident  radiation  is  linearly 
polarized  along  the  direction  of  the  plasma  object.  In  this  case,  the  plasma  electrons 
experience coherent oscillations in the incident microwave field and radiate a Hertzian dipole 
radiation  pattern  in  a  far  field.  Measurement  of  the  scattered  signal  amplitude  allows 
determining the total number of electrons in the plasma volume and average plasma density 
after appropriate calibration of the system with dielectric scatterers. 

Thus,  RMS  technique  demonstrated  strong  potential  for  absolute  diagnostics  of  laser-
induced  plasmas.  However,  direct  measurements  of  𝑁𝑒  for  a  variety  of  other  important 
atomic and molecular gases were not conducted before. This work is intended to fill this gap 
by  conducting  measurements  of  the  number  of  electrons  generated  by  femtosecond  laser 
pulse in O2, Xe, Ar, N2, Kr and CO.  

  Experimental Details 

Schematic  of  the  experimental  setup  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  A  regeneratively  amplified 
Ti:Sapphire laser system (Solstice Ace; Spectra Physics, Inc.) was used as the fs-laser source 
having  126  fs  Gaussian  temporal  width  at  800  nm  wavelength,  which  was  focused  into  a 
positive pressure chamber using a plano-convex spherical lens of 1 m focal length. The laser 
was  operated  at  100 Hz  repetition  rate.  The  diameter  of  the  beam  incident  on  the  lens  was 
7 mm.  A  half  wave  plate  and  thin  film  polarizer  were  used  to  control  the  irradiance  of  the 
beam,  which  was  measured  using  a  laser  power  meter  (Gentec-EO  XLP12-3S-H2-DO) 
placed  after  the  lens.  The  positive  pressure  chamber  was  made  in-house.  Thin  polyethene 
film was used for the walls of the chamber. It had small apertures for entry and exit of the 
laser beam and in order to maintain a continuous flow of the gas. The duration of the pulse 
was  measured  using  single  shot  autocorrelation  (TiPA,  Light  Conversion,  Inc.))  and  was 
logged throughout the experiment to ensure no drift in laser characteristics was taking place. 
For this work the measured beam waist and Rayleigh length were 𝑤𝑜=93.6 μm, 𝑧𝑅=26.9 mm, 
respectively.15,16 

 
Fig. 1. Femtosecond laser experimental setup and RMS homodyne measurement system. Laser operates at 
800  nm  wavelength  with 100  Hz  repetition  rate.  The  beam  passes  through  a  half  wave  plate  (HWP)  and  thin 
film  polarizer  (TFP)  which  are  used  to  control  laser  power  measured  using  power  meter  (PM).  The  beam  is 
focused  using  1 m  plano-convex  (L)  lens.  The  RMS  system  is  calibrated  using  dielectric  Teflon  scatterers  of 
know  dimensions.  For  the  dielectric  scatterers,  the  output  signal  is  recorded  right  after  the  mixer  without 
additional amplification (32 dB power). Tested gases included: O2, Xe, Ar, N2, Kr, and CO.17. 

RMS  technique  was  used  to  measure  the  total  number  of  electrons  in  the  laser-induced 
plasma.  Microwave  radiation  was  used  to  irradiate  the  plasma.  The  polarization  of  the 
microwave  electric field  was kept along the  direction of the  elongated plasma volume.  The 
plasma volume was located far enough from the microwave horn so that the incident electric 
field  was  uniform  across  the  width  of  the  plasma.15,16  The  plasma  volume  was  polarized 
under  the  influence  of  the  microwave  field  and  radiated  as  a  dipole  antenna.  Since  the 
amplitude  of  radiation  was  uniform  everywhere  inside  the  plasma  channel,  the  scattered 
radiation in the far field is analogues to that of the Hertzian dipole. This process is equivalent 
to  elastic  scattering  of  light  in  the  Rayleigh  regime  when  the  wavelength  of  light  is  much 
greater than the size of the scatterer. The scattered signal from the plasma is proportional to 
the number of electrons inside the scattering volume. The RMS system was calibrated using a 
dielectric of known properties as scattering medium which enables absolute determination of 
electron numbers. Eq. (1) is the governing equation used for measuring the total number of 
electrons  in  the  plasma.  Where,  Ne  -  total  number  of  electrons,  e  -  electron  charge,  me  -

For  this  experiment,  a  homodyne  detection-based  RMS  system  was  used.  Microwave 
source having frequency 10.75 GHz was used to irradiate the plasma volume. The output of 
the source was divided into two branches using a splitter. One branch carried the microwaves 
to the radiating horn after amplification. The other branch was connected to the LO port of

the I/Q mixer. The scattered signal was received by a second horn, amplified and carried to 
the  RF  port  of  the  mixer.  The  output  of  the  mixer  was  again  amplified  and  connected  to  a 
digital oscilloscope(Teledyne Lecroy HDO9304) to record the data.  

The calibration of the RMS system was done by using Teflon dielectric bullets having a 
cylindrical shape with length 10 mm, diameter 3.175 mm and relative permittivity 2.10. The 
bullet  was  propelled  using  a  pneumatic  gun  through  the  microwave  field.  The  path  of 
dielectric  scatterer  was  chosen  to  be  same  as  the  path  of  the  laser  beam  in  the  later 
experiments. Fig. 2 shows the output signal of the RMS system produced by Teflon bullet. 
The system calibration coefficient was found to be A =6.72105 VΩm−2.

Experimental setup shown in Fig. 3 was used to study the contribution of the non-linear 
processes in the laser beam propagation.5 The system used the same 1000 mm lens as used in 
the setup shown in  Fig.  1. The diverging  beam after the focus was reflected from a  pair  of 
beam  sampler  onto  a  beam  profiler.  Each  reflection  reduced  the  intensity  of  the  beam  by 
95%.  𝐷4𝜎  Beam  diameter    was  measured  by  Newport  LBP2-VIS2  Laser  Beam  Profiler. 
Measurements of the beam diameter were made for different pulse energies at two locations 
after  the  focus.  The  details  of  the  measurements  and  analysis  of  the  results  are  presented 
below.

different beam irradiances.  A pair of wedge beam samplers (BS) was used to reduce the irradiance of the beam 
after focus to prevent saturation of BP.

Results and Discussion 

The moment of inception of non-linear effects was determined using the setup shown in 
Fig.  3.  To  this  end,  the  beam  radius  𝑤 was  measured  in  ambient  air  at  a  location  after  the 
focus,  namely  𝑧=67  cm  for  different  laser  pulse  energies.  Fig.  4  shows  the  dependence  of 
beam radius vs. laser pulse energy and demonstrates three characteristic images of the beam 
profiles  taken  for  𝐸0=80,  280  and  640  J.  One  can  see  that  beam  radius  has  saturated  at 
2.1mm  with  5  %  accuracy  for 𝐸0 < 280 𝜇J.  However,  there  is  rapid  decrease  in  size  for 
𝐸0 > 280μJ.  The  reduction  in  the  beam  size  is  attributed to  non-linear  Kerr  effect  near the 
focal  region  (Kerr  effect  dominates  over  the  plasma  non-linearity  at  low  end  of  laser 
irradiances).1,5 Thus, it can  be concluded that threshold  of non-linear effect inception in  air 
corresponds to the laser pulse energy of 𝐸0=280 J and corresponding irradiance,𝐼0=6.471012 
W/cm2.

Based  on  the  above  findings,  low  laser  pulse  energies  in  the  range  of  220-300  J  were 
used for determination of photoionization rate and electron number density in O2 as detailed 
below.  The  non-linear  effects  are  negligible  in  that  range  of  energies  and,  therefore,  the 
Gaussian  beam  distribution  in  vicinity  of  the  focal  plane  can  be  used  𝐼(𝑟, 𝑧, 𝑡) =

Fig. 6 presents log-log plot of the total number of electron in the plasma after laser pulse 
as  a  function  of  laser  pulse  energy  in  Xe,  O2,  Kr,  CO,  N2,  and  Ar.  These  experiments  were 
conducted at atmospheric pressure and intensities when Gaussian beam intensity distribution 
does not apply due to non-linear phenomena. Therefore, in these experiments, only temporal 
dynamics of total number of electrons  𝑁𝑒(𝑡) was determined without making any additional 
assumptions  on  the  intensity  distribution  in  the  laser  beam.  One  can  observe  the  following 
features.  Firstly,  the  total  number  of  electrons  produced  by  the  laser  pulse  in  all  gases 
increases as a power function of pulse energy. Xe is ionized the most to produce the highest 
number  of  electron  from  the  same  pulse  energy  compared  to  other  gases  in  the  experiment 
whereas  N2  produces  the  least.  The  energy  requirement  for  electron  generation  increases 
going from left to right. Secondly, the ionization of Xe is ~2 orders of magnitude greater than 
O2.  Electron  numbers  generated  in  N2  (𝜀𝑖 =15.6 eV)  and  Ar  (𝜀𝑖 =15.7 eV)  are  almost  the 
same  for  corresponding  pulse  energies  (450-700  J)  which  is  in  agreement  of  their  nearly 
identical  ionization  potentials.  Ionization  in  Kr  is  2  times  greater  than  CO  at  lower  pulse 
energies  (~240  J)  and  the  difference  increases  to  10  (~370  J).  Thirdly,  at  higher  pulse 
energies  the  electron  production  starts  to  saturate.  The  saturation  sets  in  at  ~180  J  in  Xe, 
370 J in Kr, 320 J in O2 and 400 J in CO. In N2 and Ar, there is no onset of saturation for 
the pulse energies used in the experiments.

Temporal decay of electrons is presented in Fig. 7. Electron decay in Ar, Kr, Xe, and N2 
can be explained by analysis of two competing processes, namely, creation of new electrons 
by ionization of the metastable atoms 𝑀∗ (where 𝑀 = Ar, Kr, Xe, or N2) at collision with 
electrons and loss of the electrons due to almost instant conversion of  𝑀+ to 𝑀2
following dissociative recombination.

In  Xe  and  N2  the  recombination  term  remains  dominant  throughout  the  plasma  decay 
𝛽𝑛𝑒 > 𝑘𝑛𝑀∗,  so  that  number  of  plasma  electrons  always  decreased  with  time.  Anomalous 
temporal evolution of 𝑁𝑒 was observed in Ar and Kr; namely, one can see that 𝑁𝑒 continues 
to  increase  even  after  the  laser  pulse.  This  behavior  can  be  potentially  explained  by  high 
metastable density 𝑛𝑀∗ and thus dominant role of the ionization term  immediately after the 
laser pulse 𝛽𝑛𝑒 > 𝑘𝑛𝑀∗. Thus, 𝜕𝑛𝑒
>0 immediately after the laser pulse and number of plasma 
electrons  increased  correspondingly.  On  later  stage  of  the  decay,  number  of  metastable 
decreased and recombination term started to  dominate causing  further reduction of  𝑁𝑒 with 
time. Time corresponding to the peak value of 𝑁𝑒 can be used to estimate the plasma density 
in  the  laser-induced  plasma.  Indeed,  𝑡𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 = 1/𝛽𝑛𝑒,  so  using   𝛽 ≈10-7  cm3/s  (Ref.  17)  and 
experimentally observed 𝑡𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘~10 ns, the plasma density can be estimated as 𝑛𝑒 ~1015 cm-3.

O2  and  CO  are  characterized  by  high  electron  affinity,  so  additional  electron  loss 
mechanism, electron attachment, must be added to the right-hand side of the Eq. (2): −𝜈𝑎𝑛𝑒.  
In these gases, electron attachment mechanism dominates the overall electron loss and causes 
significantly faster 𝑁𝑒 decay observed on the time scale ~ 1 ns in the experiments shown in 
Fig. 7e and Fig. 7f. These decay times can be supported by the theoretical estimations. The 
rate of three-body attachment electron to oxygen molecule can be calculated using 𝜈𝑎 = 𝑘𝑂2 ∙

Conclusion 

In  this  work,  we  have  successfully  measured  the  total  number  of  electrons  created  by 
focusing near-infrared femtosecond laser pulse for several gases at atmospheric pressure. The 
method  was  based  on  elastic  scattering  of  microwaves  off  the  plasma  volume  and  absolute 
calibration of the microwave system using dielectric scatterers with known properties. Point 
of  inception  of  non-linear  optical  effects  in  air  was  determined  and  photoionization  rate  in 
oxygen was determined for lower laser intensities (< 6.471012 W/cm2). Electron decay after 
the  laser  pulse  was  consistent  with  competition  of  two  processes,  namely,  creation  of  new 
electrons by ionization of the metastable atoms at collisions with electrons and electron loss 
due to dissociative recombination and attachment to oxygen.
