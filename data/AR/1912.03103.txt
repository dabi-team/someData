The characterization of cyclic cubic ﬁelds with power
integral bases

Tomokazu Kashio∗

March 31, 2020

Abstract

We provide an equivalent condition for the monogenity of the ring of integers of
any cyclic cubic ﬁeld. Although a large part of the main results is covered by the
classical one of Gras, we write the condition more explicitly. First, we show that
if a cyclic cubic ﬁeld is monogenic then it is a simplest cubic ﬁeld Kt deﬁned by
Shanks’ cubic polynomial ft(x) := x3 − tx2 − (t + 3)x − 1 with t ∈ Z. Then we
give an equivalent condition for when Kt is monogenic, which is explicitly written
in terms of t.

1 Main results

We say a number ﬁeld K has a power integral basis if its ring of integers OK is generated
by one element: OK = Z[γ]. We say also that K or OK is monogenic. Let K be an
abelian ﬁeld of prime degree p. It is known that K has a power in integral basis when
p = 2, and does not have when p (cid:61) 5 unless K = Q(ζ2p+1 + ζ −1
2p+1) and 2p + 1 is a prime
[Gr4]. In this sense, the case of p = 3 (i.e., cyclic cubic ﬁelds) is of great interest. In fact,
Dummit-Kisilevsky [DK] showed that there exist inﬁnitely many cyclic cubic ﬁelds with
or without power integral bases, respectively. Archinard [Ar] and Gras [Gr1, Gr2, Gr3]
also studied this case.

Now we introduce the Shanks cubic polynomials [Sh]

ft(x) = x3 − tx2 − (t + 3)x − 1 (−1 (cid:53) t ∈ Z).

Let θt be a root of ft(x) = 0 and put Kt := Q(θt). We assume that −1 (cid:53) t since we have
Kt = K−(t+3). The followings are well-known facts:

• Kt/Q is a cyclic cubic extension. We put

G := Gal(Kt/Q) = (cid:104)σ(cid:105) = {id, σ, σ2}.

• θt is a unit ∈ O×

• Let cK and dK denote the conductor and the discriminant, respectively. We have

cKt = (cid:112)dKt | ∆t := t2 + 3t + 9.

√

dK follows from the conductor-discriminant formula. We abbreviate
The relation cK =
as N := NK/Q, Tr := Tr K/Q. We call a cyclic cubic ﬁeld of the form K = Kt (−1 (cid:53) t ∈ Z)
a simplest cubic ﬁeld.

We state the main result in this paper. Let vp(n) denote the order at a prime p of an

integer n deﬁned by

n = pvp(n)n0,

(p, n0) = 1.

Theorem 1.1. Let K be a cyclic cubic ﬁeld. The followings are equivalent.

t (cid:54)≡ 3, 21 mod 27,

In such a case, a power integral basis γ ∈ OK is given by

Remark 1.2. The condition in Theorem 1.1-(iii) or Corollary 1.6-(iii) below is given in
terms of t (and ∆t = t2 + 3t + 9). Namely, we can study the monogenity without studying
the number ﬁeld Kt itself.

Let us explain the results of the paper more precisely. First we obtain the following
characterization (Theorem 1.3) of cyclic cubic ﬁelds having power integral bases. We
prepare some notations. For a number ﬁeld k, we denote by Ik, Pk the group of all
fractional ideals, all principal ideals, respectively. Additionally, we put

I G
K := {A ∈ IK | σ(A) = A} ,

K := I G
P G

K ∩ PK

to be the group of all ambiguous ideals, all principal ambiguous ideals, respectively. Let
CK be a unique integral ideal satisfying

N CK = cK,

which is given by Proposition 4.1-(i) in §4. We easily see that

• CK ∈ I G

K. In particular, if CK is principal, then CK ∈ P G
K .

• Let K = Kt. Then (θt − σ(θt)) ∈ P G
K .

In fact, by deﬁnition, we have σ(CK) = Cσ(K) = CK. The latter one follows from an
explicit calculation:

σ(θt) − σ2(θt)
θt − σ(θt)

=

− −1
1+θt

− 1+θt
θt
θt + 1+θt
θt

=

−1
1 + θt

= σ2(θt) ∈ O×
K.

(2)

Additionally we consider the natural projection

K → P G
P G

K /PQ, A (cid:55)→ A := A mod PQ.

We also consider the 1st cohomology group

H 1(G, O×

K) = (cid:8)u ∈ O×

K | N (u) = 1(cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:8)uσ−1 | u ∈ O×

K

(cid:9)

and denote the class of u ∈ O×

K with N (u) = 1 by [u] ∈ H 1(G, O×

K).

Theorem 1.3. Let K be a cyclic cubic ﬁeld.

(i) If K has a power integral basis, then we have

• K is a simplest cubic ﬁeld.

• CK is principal.

(ii) Assume that K is a simplest cubic ﬁeld and CK is principal, say CK = (β). The

followings are equivalent.

(a) K has a power integral basis.
(b) There exists t satisfying that K = Kt and [βσ−1] = [θt] ∈ H 1(G, O×

K).

(c) There exists t satisfying that K = Kt and CK = (θt − σ(θt)) ∈ P G

Note that βσ−1 = σ(β)

[βσ−1(cid:15)σ−1] = [βσ−1] for (cid:15) ∈ O×
K.

β ∈ O×

K since CK is an ambiguous ideal and that the cohomology
K) does not depend on the choice of β since [(β(cid:15))σ−1] =

Next, we give certain equivalent conditions for when CKt is principal. We also give an

explicit condition in Corollary 5.2 in §5.

Theorem 1.4. Let K = Kt. For simplicity, assume that K (cid:54)= Q(ζ9+ζ −1

(i) CK is principal.

(ii) CK = (θt − σ(θt)) or (θt − σ(θt))2 ∈ P G

K /PQ.

(iii) ∆t

or ∆2

cK

∈ N3.

Note that the condition (i) is independent of the choice of t with K = Kt, so are (ii), (iii).
We also note that the exception CQ(ζ9+ζ−1

9 ) is a principal ideal (= (ζ9 + ζ −1

9 + 1)2).

Then, in §6, we derive Theorem 1.1 from Theorems 1.3, 1.4 (and Corollary 5.2), and

some properties of cK, ∆t introduced in §3.

Remark 1.5. The following characterization of cKt summarizes the results in §3:

cKt =






(cid:89)

vp(∆t)(cid:54)≡0 mod 3
(cid:89)
32

p(cid:54)=3,vp(∆t)(cid:54)≡0 mod 3

(3 (cid:45) t or t ≡ 12 mod 27),

p

(otherwise).

(3)

We derive this expression in §3 although it seems to be well-known.

By [Ok] or [Ho, Theorem1.4], we have Kt (cid:54)= Kt(cid:48) if t (cid:54)= t(cid:48) except for

K−1 = K5 = K12 = K1259, K0 = K3 = K54(= Q(ζ9 + ζ −1

9 )), K1 = K66, K2 = K2389.

We see that these exceptions have power integral bases by applying Theorem 1.1 for
t = −1, 0, 1, 2 (Table 1 in §2). Assume that t (cid:54)= −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 54, 66, 1259, 2389.
Then, in Theorem 1.1, Theorem 1.3, we may replace “There exists t satisfying that K = Kt
and ∼” with “For a unique t satisfying K = Kt, we have ∼”. In particular, we have the
following.

Corollary 1.6. If a cyclic cubic ﬁeld K have a power integral basis, then it is a simplest
cubic ﬁeld, that is, there exists t satisfying that K = Kt. Moreover, the following are
equivalent.

(i) Kt has a power integral basis.

4

(ii) t ∈ {−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 54, 66, 1259, 2389} or t satisﬁes that ∆t
cKt

∈ N3.

(iii) t ∈ {−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 54, 66, 1259, 2389} or t satisﬁes that t (cid:54)≡ 3, 21 mod 27 and

that vp(∆t) (cid:54)≡ 2 mod 3 for all p (cid:54)= 3.

In such a case, a power integral basis is given by (1).

The outline of this paper is as follows. In §2, we present examples of Theorem 1.1,
Corollary 1.6. In §3, we recall well-known properties of the conductors of cubic cyclic
ﬁelds and simplest cubic ﬁelds. The main results are in §4, 5. In §4, we ﬁrst show that

K has a power integral basis =⇒ CK = (α) with Tr (α) = 0
CK = (α) with Tr (α) = 0

=⇒ K is a simplest cubic ﬁeld (Lemma 4.2).

(Proposition 4.1),

Hence we obtain Theorem 1.3-(i):

K has a power integral basis =⇒

(cid:40)K is a simplest cubic ﬁeld,

CK is principal.

The “converse” does not hold true:
which states that

in the remaining of §4, we prove Theorem 1.3-(ii)

K has a power integral basis ⇐⇒





K is a simplest cubic ﬁeld

CK is principal

.

one of (b), (c), (d) in Theorem 1.3-(ii).

One of the key ideas is a relation between

“power integral bases”

and

“units u satisfying 1 + u + uσ(u) = 0”,

which can be obtained by combining Proposition 4.1-(ii)-[(a) ⇔ (c)] with Lemma 4.2-[(i)
⇔ (ii)]. In §5, we study the conditions when the ideal CKt is principal and give a proof
of Theorem 1.4. Summarizing the above, we derive Theorem 1.1 in §6.

Remark 1.7.

(i) Our basic idea is to decompose the monogenity of K into two steps:

• CK is principal where one of its generator α satisfying Tr (α) = 0.
• There exists γ ∈ OK satisfying α = γ − σ(γ) (i.e, a special case of the integral
version of additive Hilbert’s Theorem 90), which have to be a power integral
basis.

This idea was established in [Se] by the second author.

(ii) Some arguments in this paper can be seen also in [Cu]. Moreover, [Cu, Lemma 1]
states that if ∆t is square-free then Kt has a power integral basis. This is a special
case of Theorem 1.1-[(iii) ⇒ (i)] in this paper.

(iii) Let K be a cyclic cubic ﬁeld. Gras [Gr1, Th´eor`eme 2] showed that the followings are

equivalent.

5

(a) K has a power integral basis.
(b) There exists a unit u ∈ O×

K satisfying

N (u) = 1,

Tr (u + u−1) + 3 = 0,

Tr

(cid:19)

(cid:18)u2 − u−1
cK

∈ N3.

This corresponds to Theorem 1.1-[(i) ⇔ (ii)] in this paper and we provide an alterna-
tive proof. In fact, that N (u) = 1, Tr (u+u−1)+3 = 0 implies Tr (u)+Tr (uu(cid:48))+3 = 0
where u(cid:48) is a conjugate of u. It follows that u is a root of ft(x) with t := Tr (u), i.e.,
K = Kt. Then we see that Tr (u2 − u−1) = Tr (u)2 − 3Tr (uu(cid:48)) = t2 + 3t + 9.

2 Examples

The left table in Table 1 below is a list of t, the prime factorization of cKt (the ramiﬁed
primes), the prime factorization of ∆t, the corresponding “case”, and the other t(cid:48) satisfying
Kt = Kt(cid:48). There are 3 “cases”:

(a) Kt has a power integral basis by Theorem 1.1 (or Corollary 1.6).

(b) Kt has a power integral basis since another t(cid:48) with Kt = Kt(cid:48) satisﬁes the condition

of Theorem 1.1 (although t does not satisfy the condition).

(c) Kt does not have a power integral basis by Corollary 1.6.

For example,

• K−1, K0, K1, K2 have power integral bases since these satisfy Theorem 1.1-(ii), (iii).

• K3 has a power integral basis since K3 = K0.

• K21 is the ﬁrst example which does not have a power integral basis (by Corollary 1.6).

The right table is a list of Kt which do not have power integral bases up to t = 2000.

Table 1: small t

Table 2 below is a list of “non-trivial cases”: those satisfy OKt

(cid:37) Z[θt] and CKt is

principal. Note that

• When OKt = Z[θt] (i.e., cKt = ∆t), it has a (trivial) power integral basis θt.

• When CKt is not principal, it does not have a power integral basis by Theorem 1.3.

• If t < 101471 then the converse of Theorem 1.3-(i): “CKt is principal ⇒ Kt has a

power integral basis” also holds true. All the examples of

“CKt is principal but Kt does not have a power integral basis”,
up to t = 108 = 100000000

are t = 101471, 182451, 18128865.

• K740 has a power integral basis although v7(∆740) = 4 (cid:54)= 1. This is the ﬁrst example
of “Kt has a power integral basis although the prime-to-3 part of ∆t is not square-
free”, except for the exceptions K5 (=K−1), K54 (=K0), K66 (=K1).

3 Primes dividing cK, ∆t

In this section, we recall properties of primes dividing cK or ∆t which are well-known for
experts. First we note that

{all the ramiﬁed primes} = {p | cKt} ⊂ {p | ∆t}

since cKt | ∆t. The following Propositions are well-known for experts.

Proposition 3.1. Let K be a cyclic cubic ﬁeld. The conductor cK satisﬁes the following
conditions. Let p denote a rational prime.

(i) If 3 | cK, then v3(cK) = 2.

(ii) If p ≡ 1 mod 3, then p | cK implies vp(cK) = 1.

(iii) If p ≡ 2 mod 3, then p (cid:45) cK.

Proposition 3.2. Let K = Kt. Then v3(∆t) takes only values of 0, 2, 3. More precisely,
we have the following.

8

(i) v3(∆t) = 0 if and only if 3 (cid:45) t. In this case, 3 (cid:45) cK.

(ii) v3(∆t) = 2 if and only if t ≡ 0, 6 mod 9. In this case, 3 | cK.

(iii) v3(∆t) = 3 if and only if t ≡ 3 mod 9. In this case,

(cid:40)

⇐⇒ 3 (cid:45) cK,
t ≡ 12 mod 27
t ≡ 3, 21 mod 27 ⇐⇒ 3 | cK.

In particular we see that

(cid:40)

3 (cid:45) cK ⇐⇒ 3 (cid:45) t or t ≡ 12 mod 27,
3 | cK ⇐⇒ t ≡ 0, 6 mod 9 or t ≡ 3, 21 mod 27.

(4)

Proposition 3.3. Let K = Kt, p (cid:54)= 3. The followings are equivalent.

vp(∆t) ≡ 0 mod 3 ⇐⇒ p (cid:45) cK.

Proposition 3.1 can be shown by noting that cK is the minimal integer satisfying

Kt ⊂ Q(ζcK ), which implies

(Z/pvp(cK )Z)× ∼= (Z/cKZ)× ∼= Gal(Q(ζcK )/Q) (cid:16) Gal(Q(K/Q) ∼= Z/3Z.

(cid:89)

p|cK

Here, we give a proof only of Proposition 3.2 since that of Proposition 3.3 is similar and
simpler.

Proof of Proposition 3.2. The “if and only if” part follows from an explicit calculation as

∆3t0 = 9t2
∆9t0 = 9(9t2

0 + 9t0 + 9,

∆3t0+1 = 9t2

0 + 15t0 + 13,

∆3t0+2 = 9t2

0 + 21t0 + 19,

0 + 3t0 + 1), ∆9t0+3 = 27(3t2

0 + 3t0 + 1), ∆9t0+6 = 9(9t2

0 + 15t0 + 7).

Then (i) holds true since cK | ∆t.
(ii) Let t = 9t0. Then the minimal polynomial of θt − t

3 − 1:

x3 + 3x2 + (−27t2

0 − 9t0)x + (−54t3

0 − 54t2

0 − 18t0 − 3)

is an Eisenstein polynomial, so we have 3 | cK. Similarly, let t = 9t0 + 6. Then the
minimal polynomial of θt − t

3 + 1:

x3 − 3x2 + (−27t2

0 − 45t0 − 18)x + (−54t3

0 − 108t2

0 − 72t0 − 15)

also is an Eisenstein polynomial, so we have 3 | cK.
(iii) Assume t ≡ 3 mod 9. Then the minimal polynomial of θt − t

3 is

x3 −

∆t
3

x −

(2t + 3)∆t
33

∈ Z[x].

9

Here we note that v3(∆t) = 3. First assume that t ≡ 3, 21 mod 27, which implies v3(2t +
3) = 2. Then the Newton polygon is given by

v3(1) = 0,

v3(0) = ∞,

v3( ∆t

3 ) = 2,

v3( (2t+3)∆t

33

) = 2,

so we have v3(θt − t
3). Next assume that
t ≡ 12 mod 27, which implies v3(2t + 3) (cid:61) 3. In this case, the Newton polygon is given
by

3. That is, 3 ramiﬁes in Kt = Q(θt − t

3) = 2

v3(1) = 0,

v3(0) = ∞,

v3( ∆t

3 ) = 2,

v3( (2t+3)∆t

27

) (cid:61) 3.

That is, 3 | θt − t
( ∆t
33 )2, which is prime to 3. Note that cK | ∆t
3 (cid:45) cK as desired.

3. Then the discriminant of (the minimal polynomial of) θt− t

⊂ OKt. Then we obtain

equals

Proof of the expression (3). The division into two cases comes from whether 3 | cKt or
not, by Proposition 3.2. The range of p and its exponent follow from Proposition 3.3 and
Proposition 3.1, respectively.

4 Monogenity and simplest cubic ﬁelds

In this section, we give a proof of Theorem 1.3 which provides an equivalent condition for
that a cyclic cubic ﬁeld K has a power integral basis.

Proposition 4.1. Let K be a cyclic cubic ﬁeld.

(i) There exists a unique integral ideal CK ⊂ OK satisfying N CK = cK.

(ii) The followings are equivalent for γ ∈ OK.

(a) γ is a power integral basis. That is, OK = Z[γ].
(b) cK = N (γ − σ(γ)).
(c) CK = (γ − σ(γ)).

In particular, if K has a power integral basis, then CK is a principal ideal with a generator
α := γ − σ(γ) satisfying Tr (α) = 0.

Proof. (i) The followings are equivalent

p | cK ⇐⇒ p | dK ⇐⇒ a unique prime ideal Pp satisﬁes p = P3

p, N Pp = p.

Hence

CK :=

Pvp(cK )
p

(cid:89)

p|cK

is the unique ideal satisfying N CK = cK.

10

(ii) We put d(γ) := (cid:81)
of K with ι (cid:54)= ι(cid:48). Then we can write

ι(cid:54)=ι(cid:48)(ι(γ) − ι(cid:48)(γ)) = N (γ − σ(γ))2, where ι, ι(cid:48) run over all embeddings

OK = Z[γ] ⇐⇒ dK = d(γ) ⇐⇒ cK = N (γ − σ(γ)),

so the assertion follows from (i).

Lemma 4.2. Let K be a cyclic cubic ﬁeld. Assume that CK is principal, take a generator
β of CK, and put uβ := βσ−1 ∈ O×

K. The followings are equivalent.

(i) There exists α ∈ OK satisfying CK = (α), Tr (α) = 0.

(ii) There exists u ∈ O×

K satisfying 1 + u + uσ(u) = 0, [uβ] = [u] ∈ H 1(G, O×

K).

(iii) There exists t satisfying K = Kt, [uβ] = [θt] ∈ H 1(G, O×

K).

Proof. [(i) ⇔ (ii)]. For any generator α := β(cid:15) ∈ CK ((cid:15) ∈ O×

K), we have

Tr (α) = β(cid:15) + σ(β(cid:15)) + σ2(β(cid:15)) = β(cid:15)(1 + uβ(cid:15)σ−1 + uβ(cid:15)σ−1σ(uβ(cid:15)σ−1)).

In particular, the followings are equivalent as desired:

Tr (α) = 0 ⇐⇒ ∃u := uβ(cid:15)σ−1 ∈ [uβ] s.t. 1 + u + uσ(u) = 0.

[(ii) ⇔ (iii)]. (⇐) is obvious. For (⇒), we note that

if 1 + u + uσ(u) = 0, then we have 0 = Tr (1 + u + uσ(u)) = 3 + Tr (u) + Tr (uσ(u)).

On the other hand, by u ∈ OK, we have

t := Tr (u) ∈ Z.

Therefore, u is a root of

(x − u)(x − σ(u))(x − σ2(u)) = x3 − Tr (u)x2 + Tr (uσ(u))x − 1 = ft(x).

Hence u is a conjugate τ (θt) of θt (τ ∈ G), so we have u = τ (θt) = θt(θt)τ −1 ∈ [θt].

Proof of Theorem 1.3-(i). Let K be a cyclic cubic ﬁeld with a power integral basis γ.
Then CK is principal by Proposition 4.1. Moreover its generator α := γ − σ(γ) satisﬁes
Tr (α) = 0. It follows that K is a simplest cubic ﬁeld by Lemma 4.2.

We show the remaining statements of Theorem 1.3.

Proposition 4.3.

(i) We have a canonical isomorphism

K /PQ ∼= H 1(G, O×
P G

K), (α) (cid:55)→ [ασ−1].

(ii) The norm map induces the following injective homomorphism

K/PQ (cid:44)→ Q×/(Q×)3, A (cid:55)→ N A mod (Q×)3.
I G

In particular, we have

H 1(G, O×

K) ∼= P G

K /PQ ⊂ I G

K/PQ (cid:44)→ Q×/(Q×)3.

11

Proof. (i) Consider the exact sequence

Then we have by Hilbert’s Theorem 90

1 → O×

K → K × → PK → 1.

1 → {±1} → Q× → P G

K → H 1(G, O×

K) → 1.

Hence we get

H 1(G, O×

K) ∼= [Coker : Q× → P G
by calculating the connecting homomorphism.
(ii) Since I G
write any ideal contained in I G

K as

K ] = P G

K /PQ, [ασ−1] ←

(α)

K is generated by ramiﬁed prime ideals and ideals contained in PQ, we can

N A = (n3)

(cid:89)

p|cK

pep ∈ (Q×)3 ⇐⇒ ep ∈ 3Z ⇐⇒ A ∈ PQ.

Hence the kernel of the norm map I G
clear.

K → Q×/(Q×)3 equals PQ. Then the assertion is

Proof of Theorem 1.3-(ii). Assume that K is a simplest cubic ﬁeld and that CK = (β).

] =
[θt] ∈ H 1(G, O×
K). The part “(a) ⇒ (b)” follows by using Proposition 4.1-(ii)-[(a) ⇒ (c)]
and Lemma 4.2-[(i) ⇒ (iii)] for α := γ − σ(γ). We prove the remaining part “(d) ⇒ (a)”
by showing that γ in (1) actually provides a power integral basis. It suﬃces to show that

5 Relation between CKt and (θt − σ(θt))
Let K = Kt be a simplest cubic ﬁeld generated by a root θt of ft(x). Recall that

• The ambiguous ideal CK satisﬁes N CK = cK.

• The principal ambiguous ideal (θt − σ(θt)) satisﬁes N (θt − σ(θt)) = ∆t.

• By Proposition 4.3 and Proof of Theorem 1.3-(ii) in the previous section, we have

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let K = Kt (cid:54)= Q(ζ9 + ζ −1
9 ). First we show that (θt − σ(θt)) /∈ PQ
(strictly speaking, (θt−σ(θt)) /∈ [Im : PQ (cid:44)→ P G
K ]). If (θt−σ(θt)) ∈ PQ, then N (θt−σ(θt)) =
∆t ∈ N3, which implies that p (cid:45) cK for any p (cid:54)= 3 by Proposition 3.3. It contradicts with
K (cid:54)= Q(ζ9 + ζ −1
9 ). We see also that CK /∈ PQ by Proposition 3.1. Then we can write by
(7) and Proposition 5.1

P G

CK (cid:54)= (1).

Therefore the followings are equivalent:

CK is principal ⇐⇒ CK ∈ P G

K /PQ

⇐⇒ there exists e ∈ {1, 2} satisfying CK ≡ (θt − σ(θt))e mod PQ
⇐⇒ there exists e ∈ {1, 2} satisfying cK ≡ ∆e

t mod (Q×)3.

Then the assertion is clear.

We also provide an explicit version of Theorem 1.4: the condition in Corollary 5.2-(iii)

below is written explicitly in terms of t.

Corollary 5.2. Let K = Kt (cid:54)= Q(ζ9 + ζ −1

9 ). The followings are equivalent.

(i) CK is principal.

(ii)

(cid:40)vp(∆t) ≡ 1 mod 3 for all p | cK or vp(∆t) ≡ 2 mod 3 for all p | cK (3 (cid:45) cK),
(3 | cK).

v3(∆t) = 2, vp(∆t) ≡ 1 mod 3 for all 3 (cid:54)= p | cK

(iii)





vp(∆t) (cid:54)≡ 1 mod 3 for all p or vp(∆t) (cid:54)≡ 2 mod 3 for all p

vp(∆t) (cid:54)≡ 2 mod 3 for all p (cid:54)= 3

(3 (cid:45) t or t ≡ 12 mod 27),

(t ≡ 0, 6 mod 9).

Proof. The equivalence (ii) ⇔ (iii) follows from Propositions 3.2, 3.3 immediately. We
prove “(i) ⇔ (ii)”. By Propositions 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, we see that

• When p (cid:54)= 3 we have

vp(cKt) = 0, 1,

vp(cKt) = 0 ⇔ vp(∆t) ≡ 0 mod 3.

• For p = 3 we have

v3(∆t) = 0, 2, 3,

3 (cid:45) cKt ⇒ v3(∆t) = 0, 3,

3 | cKt ⇔ 32(cid:107)cKt ⇒ v3(∆t) = 2, 3.

Theorem 1.4 implies that

(i) CK is principal ⇐⇒ e = 1 or 2 satisﬁes vp(∆t) ≡ evp(cK) mod 3 for all p.

(8)

14

When 3 (cid:45) cK, we may rewrite (8) as

⇐⇒ e = 1 or 2 satisﬁes vp(∆t) ≡ evp(cK) mod 3 for all p | cK
⇐⇒ e = 1 or 2 satisﬁes vp(∆t) ≡ e mod 3 for all p | cK (that is, (ii) with 3 (cid:45) cK),

by using the facts that

vp(cK) = 0 ≡ evp(∆t) mod 3
vp(cK) = 1

(p (cid:45) cK),
(p | cK)

respectively.

When 3 | cK, we have v3(∆t) (cid:54)≡ 2vp(cK) mod 3 by v3(∆t) = 2, 3, v3(cK) = 2. Hence

the case of e = 2 in (8) can not happen. Therefore we may rewrite (8) as

⇐⇒ vp(∆t) ≡ vp(cK) mod 3 for all p | cK

⇐⇒

(cid:40)

v3(∆t) = 2,
vp(∆t) ≡ 1 mod 3 for all 3 (cid:54)= p | cK

as desired, by using facts that v3(∆t) = 2, 3, v3(cK) = 2, and vp(cK) = 1 (3 (cid:54)= p | cK).

6 Proof of Theorem 1.1

We give a proof of Theorem 1.1. The expression (1) of a power integral basis is given
in the proof of Theorem 1.3-[(d) ⇒ (a)] in §4. We show that the following conditions in
Theorem 1.1 are equivalent (we rewrite iii(cid:13) slightly by using Proposition 3.2):

i(cid:13) K has a power integral basis.

ii(cid:13) There exists t satisfying that K = Kt and ∆t
cK

∈ N3.

iii(cid:13) There exists t satisfying that K = Kt and

(cid:40)vp(∆t) (cid:54)≡ 2 mod 3 for all p

(3 (cid:45) t or t ≡ 12 mod 27),

vp(∆t) (cid:54)≡ 2 mod 3 for all p (cid:54)= 3 (t ≡ 0, 6 mod 9).

The equivalence i(cid:13) ⇔ ii(cid:13) follows from Theorem 1.3-(i), Theorem 1.3-(ii)-[(a) ⇔ (d)] and
i(cid:13) & ii(cid:13) ⇒ iii(cid:13) ⇒
Theorem 1.4-[(i) ⇔ (iii)] immediately. Hence it suﬃces to show that
ii(cid:13). When K = Q(ζ9 + ζ −1
ii(cid:13), iii(cid:13)
by Q(ζ9 + ζ −1

9 ), the assertion holds since Q(ζ9 + ζ −1

9 ) = ∆0 = 9. We assume that K (cid:54)= Q(ζ9 + ζ −1
9 ).

9 ) = K0, cQ(ζ9+ζ−1

9 ) satisﬁes both of

[ i(cid:13) & ii(cid:13) ⇒ iii(cid:13)]. Assume that i(cid:13) holds. Then CK is principal by Theorem 1.3-(i). There
are three cases by Corollary 5.2-[(i) ⇔ (iii)]:

(a) vp(∆t) (cid:54)≡ 1 mod 3 for all p and (3 (cid:45) t or t ≡ 12 mod 27).

(b) vp(∆t) (cid:54)≡ 2 mod 3 for all p and (3 (cid:45) t or t ≡ 12 mod 27).

15

(c) vp(∆t) (cid:54)≡ 2 mod 3 for all p (cid:54)= 3 and (t ≡ 0, 6 mod 9).

Note that iii(cid:13) states that only (b) or (c) holds. On the other hand,

ii(cid:13) states that

vp(∆t) ≡ vp(cK) mod 3 for all p.

Since K (cid:54)= Q(ζ9 + ζ −1

9 ), there exists p | cK, (cid:54)= 3, which satisﬁes

vp(cK) = 1

(9)

(10)

by Proposition 3.1. Hence (a) and (9) do not hold simultaneously.

[ iii(cid:13) ⇒ ii(cid:13)]. Assume iii(cid:13) holds. Then CK is principal since iii(cid:13) is a part of the condition of
or ∆2
∈ N3 by Theorem 1.4. However, under
Corollary 5.2-(iii). Therefore we have ∆t
t

cK
iii(cid:13), ∆2
