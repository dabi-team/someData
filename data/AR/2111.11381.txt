ABSTRACT

A functional time series approach is proposed for investigating spatial correlation
in daily maximum temperature forecast errors for 111 cities spread across the U.S.
The modelling of spatial correlation is most fruitful for longer forecast horizons, and
becomes less relevant as the forecast horizon shrinks towards zero. For 6-day-ahead
forecasts, the functional approach uncovers interpretable regional spatial effects,
and captures the higher variance observed in inland cities versus coastal cities, as
well as the higher variance observed in mountain and midwest states. The functional
approach also naturally handles missing data through modelling a continuum, and
can be implemented efﬁciently by exploiting the sparsity induced by a B-spline
basis.

The temporal dependence in the data is modeled through temporal dependence
in functional basis coefﬁcients. Independent ﬁrst order autoregressions with gen-
eralized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity [AR(1)+GARCH(1,1)] and
Student-t innovations work well to capture the persistence of basis coefﬁcients
over time and the seasonal heteroskedasticity reﬂecting higher variance in winter.
Through exploiting autocorrelation in the basis coefﬁcients, the functional time se-
ries approach also yields a method for improving weather forecasts and uncertainty
quantiﬁcation. The resulting method corrects for bias in the weather forecasts, while
reducing the error variance.

Spatial Correlation in Weather Forecast Accuracy: A Functional Time Series Approach A PREPRINT

1 Introduction

A functional time series is a time-indexed sequence of stochastic processes {ft(τ )}∞
t=1 where each
ft(·) is a random function on the domain T . By unifying functional data analysis with time series
analysis, it presents an approach to modelling randomness on curves, surfaces, and other phenom-
ena varying over a spatial continuum where these functional data are observed regularly over time
and exhibit serial dependence. Ramsay and Silverman (2005) and Tsay (2010) provide background
for functional data analysis and time series analysis respectively, while Hörmann and Kokoszka
(2012) provides background for functional time series.

Hyndman and Shahid Ullah (2007) and Hyndman and Booth (2008) propose a forecasting ap-
proach for functional time series and apply it to demographic data. Hyndman and Shang (2009)
proposes a weighted functional approach which assigns more weight to recent observations and
yields an improvement in forecast accuracy. Further developments in functional forecasting with
applications to demographic data are found in Shang et al. (2011), Hyndman et al. (2013), and
Dokumentov et al. (2018). Aue et al. (2017) develops the theory for functional GARCH models.
Kowal et al. (2017) introduces a Bayesian framework for functional time series, and Kowal et al.
(2019) develops functional autoregression for sparsely and irregularly sampled data.

The most common examples of functional data are samples of 1-dimensional curves, and a contri-
bution of this paper is the analysis of a model for 2-dimensional surface data. In this application,
the spatial domain T is a rectangle in R2 containing the range of longitudes and latitudes covering
the lower 48 states. The data set is taken from the 2018 American Statistical Association Data
Expo3, consisting of daily maximum temperature forecasts from the National Weather Service for
111 cities spread across the US (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) over the period from July 2014
to September 2017. The locations of the cities are illustrated in Figure 1. Forecasts range from
same-day to six-days-ahead and are compared to actual temperature recorded at city airports.

A functional time series approach is applied to investigate and extract the structure of the spatial
correlation in forecast errors. Through modelling the entire continuum instead of individual points,
the proposed functional data approach also naturally handles missing data. This is a vital beneﬁt, as
data records are frequently incomplete and forecasts are not always available at every location. This
paper also extends the methodology of Hyndman and Shahid Ullah (2007) with the incorporation
of a heteroskedastic time series model to account for the higher unpredictability of weather in
winters compared to summers.

Through exploiting both the spatial and temporal dependence in weather forecast errors, one can
estimate the next day’s expected forecast error and correct the forecast accordingly.

In this paper, a four-step procedure is used to facilitate this estimation. Section 2.1 describes
the initial pre-processing step, where we ﬁrst construct continuous surface data from the discrete
observations using manually selected B-splines. The resolution of the chosen B-splines are set so
that cities are able to be grouped into regions of interest. Once these surfaces are built, the second
step is to reduce dimension to a smaller spatial basis which describes the most important modes
of variation, and this is described in Section 2.2. After the spatial basis is chosen, the next step is
to model the temporal dependence in the random coefﬁcients which scale the basis functions, and

this is described in Section 2.3. The time series model facilitates the ﬁnal step, the prediction of
forecast errors, and this is described in Section 3.1.

2 Methodology

We ﬁrst ﬁx a forecast horizon h of interest, in this case between 0 to 6 days ahead. For the given
forecast horizon, let Yt(τ ) be the forecast error of maximum temperature on day t for the city
located at spatial coordinates τ ≡ (longitude, latitude). Spatial correlation is captured through
the following spatio-temporal random effect model:

K

Yt(τ ) = µ(τ ) +

βktϕk(τ ) + εt(τ ).

(1)

k=1
X
Here, µ(τ ) represents the mean forecast error and is assumed ﬁxed over time. Estimation of the
mean function is described in Section 2.1. The spatial basis functions ϕ1(τ ), . . . , ϕK(τ ) describe
the main modes of variation in the forecast errors, capturing spatial dependence across different
regions of the U.S. The construction of the basis functions is described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.
The random coefﬁcients βkt capture temporal correlation. They are modelled using independent
AR(1)+GARCH(1,1) processes, as described in Section 2.3. Lastly, εt(τ ) is a white noise process
independent of the random coefﬁcients, and is assumed i.i.d. N(0, σ2) for all t and τ . It is used
to capture, including any measurement errors, the remaining variation not explained by the spatio-
temporal random effect.

Writing Φ(τ ) = [ϕ1(τ ) · · · ϕK(τ )]T and βt = [β1t · · · βKt]T , this model implies the following
spatio-temporal covariance function:

Cov(Yt(τ ), Yt′(τ ′)) = Φ(τ )T E[βtβT

t′ ]Φ(τ ′) + σ2

1{t=t′,τ =τ ′},

(2)

where the indicator function 1{t=t′,τ =τ ′} is 1 when both t = t′ and τ = τ ′, and 0 otherwise.

2.1 Pre-Processing with Spline Smoothing

A two-step procedure is employed to construct the spatial basis functions ϕk. As an initial pre-
processing step, we ﬁrst need to construct continuous surface data from the discretely observed
values using manually selected B-splines, where the knot sequence is at the right level of tightness
to capture regional groupings of the cities. Once these surfaces are built, the singular value decom-
position (SVD) is used in Section 2.2 to reduce dimension and identify the ϕk which describe the
most important modes of variation.
For simplicity, we consider the spatial domain as a subset of R2. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne a 2-
D cubic B-spline basis over the rectangle [−124, −66] × [24, 49], which contains the range of
longitudes and latitudes covering the lower 48 states. The 2-D splines are built from the tensor
product of 1-D cubic B-splines on longitude and latitude individually. Refer to de Boor (2001) for
further background on B-splines. The MATLAB package ‘bspline’ by Hunyadi (2020) is used to
implement the splines.

For this particular dataset, knot sequences with 13 equally spaced interior knots were able to cap-
ture interesting regional groupings of the cities, and the knots are visualized against the cities by
the grey grid lines in Figure 1. This results in 17 cubic B-splines in each dimension, and 289 2-D
splines in the resulting tensor product, denoted by S1(τ ), . . . , S289(τ ), with

KLon = [−124, −124, −124, −124, −119.86, −115.71, . . . , −66, −66, −66, −66],
KLat = [24, 24, 24, 24, 25.79, 27.57, . . . , 49, 49, 49, 49], and

For each day t = 1, . . . , m, we ﬁt splines such that the coefﬁcients ˆct,1, . . . , ˆct,289 solve the follow-

where τt,1, . . . , τt,nt are the observation locations available on day t. This handles (moderate
amounts of) missing data naturally since missing observations Yt(τ ) are simply omitted from the
objective function. Also, since B-splines have compact support, the resulting system is sparse and
can be solved efﬁciently.

As the number of coefﬁcients exceeds the number of observation locations, a truncated singular
value decomposition is used to solve for the coefﬁcients. The truncated SVD acts as a form of
regularization similar to ridge regression, and further details can be found in Hansen (1987). In
Figure 1, there is a lack of observations in regions of the rectangle outside the borders of the United
States. The truncated SVD yields stable results by imposing zero coefﬁcients for the splines that
lie in these data-free regions.

We denote the resulting coefﬁcient matrix by C = [ˆct,j]. We use the column means ¯C =
¯c1, . . . , ¯c289

2.2 Constructing Spatial Basis Functions ϕk
As each spline function captures variation speciﬁc to a sub-rectangle of the domain, the amount of
information in each region of the domain is encoded through the coefﬁcients of its corresponding
splines. Through studying the covariance of the B-spline coefﬁcients, we are able to piece together
variation across multiple sub-rectangles to study the important regional effects in the weather fore-
cast errors. A principal component analysis yields a ranked order of groupings through the eigen-
decomposition of the covariance matrix, or equivalently, the singular value decomposition of the
mean-centered data matrix. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix identify weightings of the
spline coefﬁcients which contribute the most variation, with said variation quantiﬁed by the size of
the eigenvalue.

After mean-centering the columns of C, the singular value decomposition C − ¯C = UΣV T pro-
vides principal component loadings as the columns of V , allowing for dimension reduction that is
mean-square optimal in the coefﬁcient space Col(C − ¯C). Refer to Jolliffe (2002) for further back-
ground on principal component analysis and singular value decomposition. Assuming the SVD is
written in descending order of singular values, the spatial basis functions ϕk(τ ) are built using the

ﬁrst K columns of V , representing the K most important principal components:

289

ϕk(τ ) =

VjkSj(τ ) for k = 1, . . . , K ≪ 289.

(5)

j=1
X

The ﬁrst four basis functions are shown in Figure 2 for the 6-day-ahead forecast horizon. The
ﬁrst basis function represents an inland versus coastal effect, as cities further inland had greater
variance in their forecast errors compared to coastal cities. The second basis function represents
an east versus west effect, with the opposing signs of the regions allowing for a differentiation
between the regions. The third and fourth basis functions represent mountain state and midwest
state effects respectively, as these regions have the most unpredictable weather.

This structure of spatial correlation is most prevalent in 6-day-ahead forecasts, but vanishes as the
forecast horizon shrinks to zero. For example, Figure 3 shows the ﬁrst four basis functions for
same-day forecasts, and these basis functions lack any coherent spatial structure.

For the 6-day-ahead forecasts, a cutoff of K = 20 basis functions is used. Each of the 20 selected
basis functions ranged from 9% to 1.4% of explained variance, while the basis functions after
the 20th each contribute less than 1.4% of explained variance and revealed no interesting spatial
structure. The results of Table 2 were stable above K = 20 basis functions, justiﬁed by Figure 7.

2.3 Modelling Random Coefﬁcients

Once the spatial basis functions are deﬁned as above, coefﬁcients β1t, . . . , βKt for each day t are
estimated on this reduced K-dimensional basis as solutions to the following optimization problem:

Temporal dependence in forecast errors is then modelled through these coefﬁcients. Empirically,
an AR(1)+GARCH(1,1) model with Student-t innovations was found to provide a good description
of the observed coefﬁcients. Speciﬁcally,

βkt = ψkβk,t−1 + ukt,

where Ft−1 is the information set up to time t − 1 (the σ-ﬁeld generated by uk,t−1, uk,t−2, . . . for
all k). The u1t, . . . , uKt are assumed conditionally independent given Ft−1. The proposed model
implies the following conditional mean and covariance functions:

E[Yt(τ )|Ft−1] = µ(τ ) +

The resulting innovations for the ﬁrst basis function u1t are shown in Figure 4 on the top left.
Notably, the innovations exhibit a seasonal heteroskedasticity with winter weather being the most
unpredictable. The GARCH process characterizes the heteroskedasticity well, as the standardized
innovations u1t/η1t exhibit approximately constant variance, and the squared standardized innova-
tions show no signiﬁcant autocorrelation.

For the 6-day-ahead weather forecasts, the AR+GARCH parameter estimates for the ﬁrst four basis
functions are shown in Table 1. All ﬁtted models were stationary with similar amounts of autocor-
relation based on the similar values of ψk. Furthermore, all exhibit a high persistence in variance,
indicated by the large values of γk. The earlier basis functions had conditional distributions with
heavier tails, indicated by lower values of νk.

3 Empirical Performance

For each pair of cities (i, j), sample spatial correlation for the 6-day-ahead forecasts is computed
before and after accounting for the spatial basis functions. More speciﬁcally, given a pair of cities
located at τi and τj, the top of Figure 5 shows

The cities are numbered from 1 to 111 (shown on the x- and y-axes), and cities are ordered from
east to west, resulting in a concentration of high correlation along the main diagonal in the ﬁrst
ﬁgure. After accounting for K = 20 spatial basis functions, the second ﬁgure indicates the lack
of spatial correlation in the residuals and provides evidence that the proposed model provides an
adequate approximation of the observed spatial correlation in forecast errors.

3.1 Predicting Forecast Errors to Improve Forecast Accuracy

Through exploiting autocorrelation in the coefﬁcients, the AR+GARCH parameter estimates can
be used to predict the next day’s basis coefﬁcients, as

k,t+1 = ωk + αku2

k,t+1), and

(13)

(14)

Substituting the parameter estimates ˆψk, ˆωk, ˆαk, ˆγk, and ˆνk in place of the true parameters yields
an approximate distribution which can be used for prediction and uncertainty quantiﬁcation.
By setting the predicted coefﬁcient to ˆβk,t+1 = ˆψkβkt, this can then be used to predict next day’s
weather forecast errors by setting

ˆYt+1(τ ) = ˆµ(τ ) +

ˆβk,t+1ϕk(τ ).

K

k=1
X

(15)

These predicted errors ˆYt+1(τ ) can then be used to adjust the next day’s weather forecast (of the
same horizon). More explicitly, for forecast horizon h and location τ , if Ft,t+h(τ ) is the forecast
on day t of the maximum temperature on day t + h and At+h(τ ) is the actual temperature on day
t + h so that Yt(τ ) = Ft,t+h(τ ) − At+h(τ ), we can deﬁne an adjusted forecast for day t + 1 as

F adj
t+1,t+1+h(τ ) = Ft+1,t+1+h(τ ) − ˆYt+1(τ ).

The improvement on weather forecasts can then be assessed by comparing the adjusted errors

Zt+1(τ ) = F adj

t+1,t+1+h(τ ) − At+1+h(τ )

to the unadjusted errors Yt+1(τ ).

The mean and variance of Y and Z across all t and τ is shown in Table 2.

(16)

(17)

The change in mean error indicates that the proposed method eliminates bias in the weather fore-
casts, while the reduction of standard deviation by 12% indicates a signiﬁcant average improve-
ment in forecast accuracy. The shift in error distribution is illustrated in Figure 8, with the adjusted
distribution centered at 0 and with smaller variance.

5 Conclusions

We have introduced a functional time series approach to investigating spatial correlation in weather
forecast accuracy. The modelling of spatial correlation is most fruitful for the longer forecast hori-
zons, and becomes less relevant as the forecast horizon shrinks towards zero. For 6-day-ahead
weather forecasts, the functional approach uncovers interpretable regional spatial effects, and cap-
tures the higher variance observed in inland cities versus coastal cities, as well as the higher vari-
ance observed in mountain and midwest states. The functional approach also naturally handles

missing data and can be implemented efﬁciently by exploiting the sparsity induced by using a
B-spline basis.

Independent ﬁrst order autoregressions with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedas-
ticity [AR(1)+GARCH(1,1)] and Student-t innovations worked well to capture the persistence of
coefﬁcients over time and the seasonal heteroskedasticity reﬂecting higher variance in winter. Au-
tocorrelation in the basis coefﬁcients can further be exploited to improve weather forecasts, espe-
cially at longer horizons, and the resulting approach eliminates bias while reducing error variance.
