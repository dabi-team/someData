Abstract: Photons carrying a well-deﬁned orbital angular momentum have been proven to
modify spectroscopic selection rules in atomic matter. Excitation proﬁles of electric quadrupole
transitions have been measured with single trapped 40Ca+ ions for varying polarizations. We
further develop the photo-absorption formalism to study the case of arbitrary alignment of the
beam’s optical axis with respect to the ion’s quantization axis and mixed multipolarity. Thus,
predictions for M1-dominated 40Ar13+, E3-driven 171Yb+ and 172Yb+, and B-like 20Ne5+ are
presented. The latter case displays novel eﬀects, coming from the presence of a strong photon –
magnetic dipole coupling.

Introduction

The interest of scientists to vortex-like dislocations in various media goes back to 1970’s [1,2]. For
historic and topical reviews we would like to refer the reader to such sources as [3, 4]. The ability
of twisted photon beams to transfer Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) as an extra degree of
freedom, ﬁrst shown in [5], has largely inﬂuenced our understanding of light, e.g. [6–13]. It made
OAM-carrying laser beams a popular research subject in optical and quantum communications
and information security [14–18]. Non-trivial topological structure of such OAM-carrying
optical vortices, paired with progress in photonics and nanotechnology [19], resulted in proposals
and subsequent implementations of novel devices and techniques [20–25].

Over years, signiﬁcant progress has been made towards understanding the mechanisms of
twisted light interaction with matter. It became clear that in order to detect transfer of photon
OAM to the internal degrees of freedom of electron conﬁgurations, one needs to consider
transitions driven by contributions higher than the electric dipole E1. This is the non-trivial
electromagnetic ﬁeld distribution in the beam vortex, that bound electrons with high angular
momentum are sensitive to [26, 27]. It has been shown for molecular [28] and atomic [29]
systems, as well as semiconductor heterostructures [30, 31].

In this paper we focus our attention on OAM-photons interacting with single trapped ions.
The possibility to enhance and control weak atomic transitions was discussed in [32], where
the authors foreseen OAM-modes being used is high precision atomic spectroscopy. Particular
interest in the ﬁeld has been payed to light-matter interactions in the case of beams carrying a
well-deﬁned OAM [33–36]. In the past a detailed experimental study demonstrated the transfer
of photon OAM to the valence electron of a single trapped 40Ca+ ion [11, 37]. This progress was

based on the technologies developed for ion-trap quantum computing [38].

Now we propose extending these methods to include atomic transitions in ions with complex
level structure such as Yb+. We also study selection rules in highly charged ions (HCI) as Ar13+
and Ne4+. We aim to stimulate experimental studies on these transitions with OAM light, and
have chosen cases that have already been experimentally studied using Gaussian beams [39–41]
or have accessible optical transitions. The theory considers arbitrary alignment of the ﬁeld vector
with respect to the atomic quantization axis and takes hyperﬁne splitting into account, extending
previous investigations [36].

The paper is structured as follows: the theoretical approach is described in section II. It is
built on the formalism for Bessel (BB) and Bessel-Gauss (BG) presented in [32, 36, 37], where
multipole expansion of the plane-wave contribution has been used, similar to [10]. In section
III we compare our ﬁndings with data obtained in 40Ca+ ions as a test case for our theory. In
this case next-to-the-leading M3 multipole is strongly suppressed, compared to the dominating
E2. Previously, the authors in [11] used semi-classical formalism, while we follow purely
quantum approach of evaluating the interaction strength in terms of photo-absorption transition
amplitudes. While certain data we use here were already published before, the data for various
photon polarization states are presented to the public for the ﬁrst time. Section IV is devoted to
theoretical predictions for the ions with strong electric, magnetic and mixed multipolarities. We
study the M1-dominant P1/2 → P3/2 transition in 40Ar13+, the E3-driven transition in 171Yb or
172Yb [42–45] and the mixed M1 + E2 multipolarity transition in 20Ne5+ [46]. The summary is
provided in section V.

2. Formalism

For twisted photons in a Bessel beam whose vortex line is displaced from the center of the target
atom by a distance b, and where the atomic states are quantized along an axis parallel to the beam
propagation direction, the transition amplitude M reads [29, 36]

m f mi Λ(b; θz = 0) =A im f −mi −2mγ ei(mγ +mi −m f )φb Jmγ −m f +mi (κb)×

This amplitude is proportional to experimentally measured transition strength ΩR = ΩRabi,
e.g. [11]. A denotes an overall normalization factor. The initial and ﬁnal atomic states have
quantum numbers { ji, mi } and { j f , mf } (where ji, f are total angular momenta of the electronic
states, with orbital angular momenta li, f ), and mγ is the projection of the photon beam’s total
angular momentum on the direction of the beam propagation, the z-axis. Jm(κb) is a Bessel
function with the argument given by the impact parameter bbb = {b cos φb, b sin φb, 0}, and the
transverse momentum magnitude κ =
m,m(cid:48)(θk) are Wigner rotation matrices
evaluated at the pitch angle θk, [47]. M (pw) is the transition amplitude for a plane wave traveling
in the z-direction with helicity Λ = ±1. We will also deﬁne (cid:96)γ from the identity mγ ≡ (cid:96)γ + Λ,
that can be interpreted as photon’s OAM in paraxial approximation.

In our practical considerations, we have used a Bessel-Gauss mode, which is a Bessel beam
with peripheral behavior suppressed by a Gaussian factor to better ﬁt experimental conditions.

A plane wave photon can be expanded in terms of spherical waves. Each spherical wave has
total angular momentum j, and the plane-wave amplitude can be expressed in terms of spherical
multipoles [32],

The C j f m f
ji mi ;j Λ are Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients, and Mjµ is the spherical amplitude of order j and
multipolarity µ. Magnetic multipoles are described with µ = 0 and electrical ones with µ = 1.
We conveniently simplify by writing Mj0 = M j and Mj1 = E j.

While the sum in Eq. (3) is formally inﬁnite, typically only two amplitudes contribute for given
atomic states, and often one of them is small enough to neglect. When an atom has nuclear spin
III magnetic hyperﬁne interaction may signiﬁcantly contribute to the atom photo-excitation. In
case of non-deformed nucleus, such as 171Yb+, nuclear electric quadrupole does not contribute
and the photon angular momentum couples to the total atomic angular momentum FFF = JJJ + III
(TAM). Hence, in eqn. (3) one requires the substitution of the principal quantum numbers

types as a function of impact parameter b. The beam direction chosen to be collinear with the
external static magnetic ﬁeld: θz = 0. Under these conditions conservation of the projection
of angular momentum along z is conserved (∆m = Λ + (cid:96)γ) for b = 0. We choose for all
plots left-circular polarized photons Λ = +1. Columns group multipolarities (M1, E2, E3),
while rows group results of increasing orbital angular momentum (cid:96)γ = 0, 1, 2. Line-type

For magnetic dipole transitions only ∆m = 1 transitions are present and there is a maximum
at the center only for (cid:96)γ = 0 where the conservation of projection of angular momentum is
conserved. For electric quadrupole (E2) transitions, also ∆m = 2 is allowed when (cid:96)γ = 1, as
seen in subplot (e). There is a non-zero interaction at the dark center of the beam. Similarly,
for the electric octupole (E3), ∆m = 3 transitions are allowed. As in all cases, transitions
are allowed for b=0 only when the conservation rule is met: ∆m = Λ + (cid:96)γ. All plots for E3
transitions also show and expanded inset with the detail if behavior for ∆m = 3 . In ﬁgure

is much weaker that E2. This is due to M3 contributing in the second-to-the-leading order in the
Taylor expansion of eikkk ·rrr , while E2 arises in ﬁrst, along with M1, e.g. [51]. To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, there are also no spectroscopic eﬀects related to the presence of M3. So the
plane-wave amplitude M (pw) can be written as:

m f mi Λ (cid:39) C5/2 m f
M (pw)

The interaction strength for a beam of deﬁnite helicity Λ and TAM mγ can then be calculated
using equation (2). One obtains

results for light polarized vertically (horizontally). For E3 we also show the corresponding
results for non-null nuclear spin (III = 1/2) in dotted-purple (dash-dot-black). We observe
the inclusion of nuclear spin in the E3 transition produces only a diﬀerence in overall
strength but no change in structure. Electric transitions (E2 and E3) are for alignment angle
θz = π/4; they show qualitatively similar behavior. In subplots (b) and (e) we contrast
our predictions with experimental data from [11]. The magnetic M1 transition is shown at
alignment angle θz = π/2 where it also shows qualitatively similar behavior to the electric
quadrupole and octupole but with the polarizations inverted.

was measured as a Rabi frequency as a function of the position of the ion with respect to the beam
(the impact paramer b). For the details about the experimental setup and trapping techniques we
refer the interested reader to e.g. [11].

First we consider data taken with angle between the quantization axis and beam propagation
vector θz = π/4. We consider two datasets. One, shown in ﬁgure 1, where excitation proﬁles are
measured as a function of the a varying polarization. And a second one, shown in ﬁgure 3 (d, e),
where detailed proﬁles are measured for two incident linear polarizations: horizontal (H) and
vertical (V) to the incidence plane formed by the direction of static magnetic ﬁeld and the beam
axis.

For both datasets on ﬁgures 1 and 3 we consider the transitions 2S1/2 → 2D5/2 between the
Zeeman-split levels: mi = 1/2 into mf = 3/2. The polarization angles for the measurements
were extracted by comparing the optical response in experiments and those generated in the
simulation. We describe the polarization vector of the beam as:

ˆe = eiδ( ˆe− cos(α/2) − ˆe+ sin(α/2) e−i2δ)

(7)

where the polar angle α and phase retardation δ ranges in the interval [0, π]. The convention used
here for right-circular ˆe− and left-circular ˆe+ polarization states is ˆe± = 1√
{∓1, −i, 0}. The H
2
state is obtained with α = 90◦ and δ = 0, and the V state is obtained using α = 90◦ and δ = 90◦.

For the case of linearly-polarized incoming photons, this can be rewritten as:

Then we substitute the eqn. (6), rotated by angle θz, as in (2). The non-zero phase diﬀerence,
coming from exponential factor exp[i(mγ + mi − mf )φb], introduces a new parameter φb. In our
simulations we are tuning this polar angle φb, responsible for the azimuthal orientation of the ion
with respect to the plane formed by the beam propagation axis and constant magnetic ﬁeld.

The calculation of the interaction strength involves two rotations performed sequentially: 1)
the rotation of the plane wave photon by the pitch angle θk and 2) the rotation of the twisted
beam over the angle θz. While the φb-dependent phase drops out on the level of Rabi frequencies
ΩR ∝ |Mm f mi Λ| for deﬁnite helicity states, the same phase factor exp(imγφb) becomes observable
for H and V-states. To control the polarization of the beam we used a set of wave-plates [11]. By
rotating a half-wave-plate, the polarization state is varied along a meridian in the Poincaré sphere.
In Figure 3 (b), (e), (h) we show a comparison of the theoretical prediction with the experimental
results for beams with diﬀerent orbital angular momentum (cid:96)γ = 0, 1, 2 with either vertical or
horizontal polarization. Some features of the data can be understood by analytic expansions of (1)
for the various cases. For small impact parameter b → 0, the Bessel function will collapse into
delta-function and the projection of the photon’s total angular momentum mγ will be transferred
into the internal degrees of freedom of the target atom, ∆m = mf − mi = mγ [36, 37, 52]. In such
a case the interaction strengths only depend on the pitch angle θk and the alignment angle θz,

From the equations above one can see that the horizontal polarization is completely suppressed
in the vortex center when θz = π/4 and (cid:96)γ = 0. In 45-degrees alignment this is a signature

of a transitions with dominant E2. This is due to their sensitivity to the ﬁeld gradients [11]
and generation of geometry-dependent terms due to rotation of the quantization axis (2). The
dependence on alignment angle was previosly discussed in [53–55].

When performing the expansion for diﬀerent OAM, expressions in (9), there is the crucial
observation to make: the plane-wave transition amplitudes of diﬀerent helicity do not contribute
on equal basis as the OAM goes up. While for (cid:96)γ = 0, 1 LC (Λ = 1) and RC (Λ = −1) contribute
symmetrically, for (cid:96)γ = 2 only RC components contribute into the absorption matrix element
at b → 0. This leads to the the eﬀect of local circular dichroism in isotropic targets. This
phenomenon is position dependent and gets stronger for beams with higher vorticity, until all the
contributions become extinct at the vertex center. This result conﬁrms and reinforces our earlier
ﬁndings [56].

In ﬁgure 1 we show the excitation proﬁles for a varying polarization for a Gaussian beam
and one with (cid:96)γ = 1. The polarization state is scanned along a meridian in the Poincaré sphere
parametrized by angle α, as deﬁned in eqn. (7). We see that the theoretical model reproduces
all the main features, including the breaking of radial symmetry for polarizations which are not
purely linear. The ﬁt parameters are the beam waist w0, the pitch angle θk and the azimuthal
angle φb.The ﬁt was performed using the whole dataset. An overall normalization constant
and pitch angle were picked for each proﬁle independently, while the waist w0 = 9µm/λ and
azimuthal angle were constrained to be the same throughout. We obtain θz = 45◦ ± 5◦ and
δ = 0 ± 0.02. The polarization patterns are strongly dependent on angle φb. In particular, when
φb → −φb one would get a picture, mirror-symmetric to Figure 1.

Finally in Figure 5 (b), (e), (h) we show excitation proﬁles for alignment angle θz = 0 and
left-circular polarization Λ = 1. We plot the results for diﬀerent OAM (cid:96)γ = 0, 1, 2 and diﬀerent
change in magnetic number ∆m = 1, 2, 3. At this angle the conservation of the projection of
angular momentum for b → 0 is observed. This is why, at the center of the beam the only
non vanishing transitions are those in which the photon orbital angular momentum matches
the change in magnetic number ∆m = mγ. However, it is interesting to note, that the ∆m = 3
transition is null even if the conservation conditions are met. This is due to an extra selection
rule in which |∆m| ≤ |∆l | = 2 for E2 transitions.

4. Predictions for M1, E3 and mixed multipolarity

In this Section we present theoretical predictions of structured light ﬁeld excitation for atomic
ions featuring electric and magnetic multipole transitions of interest.

contribution from each of the multipoles. In all the cases ∆m = 1, φb = 0 and the alignment
angle is chosen to be θz = π/4. Each row shows the expected result for increasing orbital
angular momentum (cid:96)γ = 0, 1, 2. Red-solid (blue-dashed) indicates results for light polarized
vertically (horizontally) beams.

π/2 we see a distinct behavior: the value of the horizontally polarized beam does not change
while the vertical goes to zero. The behavior for M3 at π/2, see ﬁgure 3 (a) is then similar to
that of E2 at π/4, but with interchanged roles of the horizontal and vertical polarizations (see
ﬁgure 3). This can be understood by the fact the E and B vectors are orthogonal in a transverse
electromagnetic wave. For higher orbital angular momentum another interesting feature is
observed: the transition strengths are the same for H and V polarized beams independent of the
alignment angle. This eﬀect is a direct result of the circular dichroism, similar to Sec. 3. This is
exempliﬁed in ﬁgure 3 (d) where we see that for b = 0 both transition strengths coincide.

isotopes and E3-driven transition

In this subsection, we consider the electric octupole (E3) transition in ytterbium known for ultra
precise optical frequency standards [58]. Ytterbium has several naturally abundant isotopes.
This makes this element an interesting species to study the role of nuclear spin and OAM for
the features of the excitation strength. Here, we will compare results for ions with a spin-less
nucleus as in isotope 172 and with III = 1/2 nuclear spin of isotope 171. The transition from the
ground state 2S1/2 →2 F7/2 is driven with light near 467 nm. In the case of 172Yb+, where the
nuclear spin is zero, we can use the formalism that has been exploited in the case of 40Ca+, and
40Ar13+ transitions and will be used also for 20Ne5+ in the section IV. C. The coupling scheme to
use for 171Yb+ is the one with the coeﬃcients (4) with the proper quantum number for angular
momentum is FFF = JJJ + III, not accounting for electric hyperﬁne interaction, e.g. [59].

As we see in ﬁgure 3, the behavior at the alignment angle θz = π/4 is conceptually similar to
the case of E2. The position of the minima and the relative amplitudes of each transition vary
slightly. And there is also a dependence of the relative interaction strengths on the spin content of
the nucleus. One can see that the ion’s response does not change drastically due to the presence
of the hyperﬁne splitting. The correction due to the presence of the nuclear spin is on the order

However, a striking and distinctive feature occurs for E3 transitions in the collinear case:
θz = 0. As we show in ﬁgure 2, now we can drive ∆m = 3 transitions. These are particularly
strong at the center of a the beam with mγ = 3 as expected from the full selection rules and
shown in ﬁgure 2 (i).

Hence, the horizontal polarization is completely suppressed when impact parameter b → 0 for
θz = π/2. Dichroism eﬀects can be seen for (cid:96)γ > 2 and the full amplitude extinction takes place
for (cid:96)γ ≥ 5 in the central region of the beam for both 171Yb+ and 172Yb+ isotopes.

Finally in Figure 4, we plot the proﬁles for varying polarizations at alignment angle θz = π/4.
It is remarkable how as small variation in polarization (∆φb = ±17◦) results in strong visual
eﬀects of mirror symmetry breaking.

and E2 + M1 separation

In this section we consider 2P1/2 → 2D3/2 transitions in B-like 20Ne5+ highly-charged-ion (HCI)
at λ = 142 nm, where M1/E2 ∝ 1.1 [46]. As before, we use the multipole expansion of equation
(3) to get the regular contributions into the plane-wave absorption amplitude as

M (pw)

(13)

With the use of equations (1), (2) and (3) one can work out the explicit form of expressions for
the rotated transition amplitudes and predict the Rabi frequencies for this case. In the general
case, the norm of the transition amplitude is not always free of interference terms. However, in
this case, no such terms arise. For this reason the behavior for this transition is simply a linear
combination of the ones for M1 and E2 as described above and shown in ﬁgure 3 and 5.

For this HCI, we study the transition amplitudes for a horizontal and vertical polarizations,
as shown in ﬁgure 5. The resulting amplitude for a transition with a mixture of M1 and E2 is
shown in the ﬁrst column. The individual multipolar contributions are shown in second - E2
and third - M1 correspondingly. One can clearly see that the quadrupole contribution (second
column) looks identical to the E2 transition discussed above for calcium ions (ﬁgure 1). As well
as the magnetic dipole contribution (third column) is identical to M1 transition discussed above
for argon HCIs.

Let’s examine this behavior mathematically in proximity to the beam vortex in this case. For

(cid:96)γ = 0 one gets:

∝ i(

3M1 − E2(1 − 2 cos θk) cos 2θz)

3M1 − E2(1 − 2 cos θk) cos θz)

(14)

For M1 → 0 we get the same approximation as in the purely E2-driven case (9). In the
same way, E2 → 0 gives eqn.(11). The same can be proved for higher values of OAM (cid:96)γ. This

means that for the case with mixed multipolarity the horizontal component cannot be completely
suppressed at any α, unless magnetic contribution is negligible or the pitch angle θk is very small.
Second, however, would mean taking the limit of OAM going to zero - the plane-wave limit.
Hence, presence of strong M1 contribution sensibly changes the photo-absorption behavior at
the beam center.

Both 20Ne5+ and 40Ar13+ have ﬁrst non-zero contribution coming from a magnetic dipole. The
observed in ﬁgure 5 (a,d,g) drastic diﬀerence in neon optical response in the area of the beam
penumbra, compared to argon ﬁgure 3 (a,d,g), is due to the presence of the second strongest
multipole - electric quadrupole. It can be inferred that contributions coming from higher order
multipoles may result into visible eﬀects in the central region, as in this case, turning minima
into maxima in position dependence of Rabi frequency. This would be especially useful for
fundamental studies in spectroscopy of highly charged ions.

5. Conclusions and Outlook

In this paper, we have studied the modiﬁcations of selection rules for electric and magnetic
transitions, particularly E2, E3, and M1, when well localized single ions interact with focused
tailored electromagnetic ﬁelds with vortices. We have developed a complete theoretical
framework, extending previous results, e.g. [36], where we can determine the full dependence of
the photoabsorption transition amplitudes on orbital angular momentum, on polarization of the
beam, on impact parameter, on nuclear spin when relevant, and on directions of the quantization
axis of the atoms. This whole framework for single ion – vortex interactions is tested and veriﬁed
using experimental data for 40Ca+ [11].

We also encourage development of future experiments involving twisted photon photoaborption
on various ions, including Yb (used for clocks) and other HCI, by predicting rates for selected
transitions and a variety of structured electromagnetic beams. We highlight peculiar eﬀects,
which can form a rich ground of fundamental studies, and will e.g. allow separating the E and M
character for given atomic transitions, and enhance the excitation rates in certain circumstances.
The calculations give transition amplitudes, which for ﬁxed laser strength are equivalent to
Rabi oscillation frequencies, as experimentally measured. The experimental results for the
40Ca ion which conﬁrmed the validity of the calculations were for the case with a 45◦ static
magnetic ﬁeld alignment and in the full polarization domain of the laser beam for OAM (cid:96)γ = 0
and 1. Together with the predictions in related conﬁgurations for Ar, Ne, and Yb ions, one
may conclude that local, or small impact parameter, alteration of the ordinary spectroscopic
selection rules enables selective enhancement of high-order multipolar contributions in the ion
response by manipulating the photon twist. Circular dichroism related to the twisted photon
topology is theoretically seen on the level of factorized multipolar contributions. The reported
circular dichroism in atom-photon interactions may contribute into the study of chiral light-matter
interactions [60].

The ions and transitions studied in this paper are excited by diﬀerent multipolarities. The
results from horizontal and vertical linear polarization states become most distinct at particular
static magnetic ﬁeld alignment angles θz, with the angle of most sensitivity depending on the
photon-atom angular momentum transfer. For the system with M1 transitions, or partial wave
amplitude with j = 1, choose θz = π/2; for E2 or j = 2, choose θz = π/4; and for E3 or
j = 3, choose again θz = π/2. For the Boron-like 20Ne5+ HCI, the M1 and E2 partial waves
are unusually similar, leading to eﬀects shown in this paper; see also [32]. This makes this HCI
a promising candidate for future experimental research of topological eﬀects in light-matter
interactions. Progress in this direction will also allow further investigation of the quantum nature
of spin-orbit coupling in photon laser beams.

Also included are a number of results for θz = 0, with transition amplitudes for diﬀering
OAM (cid:96)γ with positive circular polarization Λ, and with diﬀering changes in the atomic angular

momentum projections, ∆m. One sees again [11, 36] the non-zero response at zero impact
parameter only for ∆m = mγ = (cid:96)γ + Λ, and of note is the good agreement with experimental data
available in a range of impact parameters for one of the 40Ca+ cases.

Photon OAM coupling to the internal atomic degrees of freedom can be used, as seen here, to
separate the electric and magnetic character of given transitions, to locally enhance next-to-leading
order transition rates and to suppress parasitic transitions. In the realm of quantum computation,
incorporation of OAM states of light can provide ion-photon interaction on the level of energy,
momentum, polarization and phase.

The theory outlined in this paper can also be successfully applied to such systems as bulk
semiconductors and artiﬁcial atoms in the ways, similar to [61, 62]. When developed, it may
become useful in such ﬁelds as metrology, classical and quantum communication, quantum
computing, high capacity data transfer, cybersecurity to name a few. The highlighted sensitivity
to the target position in the beam, polarization and phase can be used in beam diagnostics.

One might beneﬁt from linking two alternative sets of angles {±ψk, ±θk, ±φk }, equivalent to
active and passive rotation 3D rotation. The conventional formalism [32,63] for photo-absorption

we have used the rotation system, deﬁned in terms of the Euler angles in (15) as {0, −θk, −φk }.
The resulting geometry-related terms are presented in the bottom half of the Table 1. If we
proceed with this alternative description in terms of active rotation, we get the equation, analogous
to (1),

As one can see, this way photon TAM projection mγ explicitly dictates multipolar balance in
