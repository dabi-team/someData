Undetected Minority-polarity Flux as the Missing Link in
Coronal Heating

ABSTRACT

During the last few decades, the most widely favored models for coronal heat-
ing have involved the in situ dissipation of energy, with footpoint shuﬄing giving
rise to multiple current sheets (the “nanoﬂare” model) or to Alfv´en waves that
leak into the corona and undergo dissipative interactions (the wave heating sce-
nario). As has been recognized earlier, observations suggest instead that the en-
ergy deposition is concentrated at very low heights, with the coronal loops being
ﬁlled with hot, dense material from below, which accounts for their overdensities
and ﬂat temperature proﬁles. While an obvious mechanism for footpoint heating
would be reconnection with small-scale ﬁelds, this possibility seems to have been
widely ignored because magnetograms show almost no minority-polarity ﬂux in-
side active region (AR) plages. Here, we present further examples to support our
earlier conclusions (1) that magnetograms greatly underrepresent the amount of
minority-polarity ﬂux inside plages and “unipolar” network, and (2) that small
loops are a major constituent of Fe IX 17.1 nm moss. On the assumption that
the emergence or churning rate of small-scale ﬂux is the same inside plages as
in mixed-polarity regions of the quiet Sun, we estimate the energy ﬂux density
associated with reconnection with the plage ﬁelds to be on the order of 107 erg
cm−2 s−1, suﬃcient to heat the AR corona.

INTRODUCTION

Coronal heating models are generally of two kinds: those that invoke magnetohydrody-
namic (MHD) waves and their dissipation, and those that rely more directly on magnetic

reconnection or the formation of current sheets (see, e.g., Parnell and De Moortel, 2012, and
In both cases, footpoint motions are usually taken to be the driving

force and granular convection the basic energy source. Although it is possible (and even
likely) that both wave dissipation and reconnection are involved in coronal heating, there is
no consensus as to which process is the dominant one.

Alfv´en waves generated at the photosphere are strongly reﬂected due to the steep falloﬀ
of the density and increase in the Alfv´en speed with height, and only a very small fraction
of the wave energy leaks through the transition region into the corona (see, e.g., Cranmer
and Ballegooijen, 2005). Given the presence of a suﬃciently large wave ﬂux density in the
corona, the mechanisms by which the Alfv´en waves are dissipated (resonant excitation, phase
mixing, turbulent interactions between outgoing and reﬂected waves) continue to be debated
(see, e.g., De Groof and Goossens, 2002; Howson et al., 2019; van Ballegooijen et al., 2014).

Heating by reconnection has been well observed in ﬂares and jets, on scales ranging
from X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) bright points (and the “campﬁres” discovered by
Solar Orbiter: Berghmans et al., 2021) to active regions (ARs). In the well-known nanoﬂare
model of Parker (1988), random footpoint motions spontaneously give rise to tangential
discontinuities/current sheets in the coronal ﬁeld, leading to multiple reconnection events
(“nanoﬂares”) and ohmic dissipation (for a recent discussion of this model, see Pontin and
Hornig, 2020). One possible diﬃculty with this scenario is that the upper parts of coronal
loops generally appear smooth and featureless, seemingly inconsistent with the large depar-
tures from a potential ﬁeld that would be associated with the predicted magnetic braiding
(van Ballegooijen et al., 2011). As emphasized by Aschwanden et al. (2007), it is at the
footpoints of coronal loops that topologically complex structures are observed. They also
argued that the high densities in AR loops and the absence of large temperature gradients
along them can only be explained if the corona is not heated locally but from below, via
chromospheric evaporation.

It has previously been suggested that small bipoles or ephemeral regions (ERs) are
the main source of coronal heating in the quiet Sun (Schrijver et al., 1998) and in coronal
holes (Parker, 1991). However, a strong argument against reconnection with small-scale
ﬁelds playing a major role in heating coronal holes and the AR corona was provided by the
statistical study of ERs by Hagenaar et al. (2008, 2010). From an examination of Michelson
Doppler Interferometer (MDI) magnetograms recorded during 2000–2005, they concluded
that the rate of ER emergence is at least a factor of 3 smaller inside predominantly unipolar
areas than in regions where the polarities are more mixed. This reduction is too large to
be attributed to the shorter cancellation timescales of minority-polarity ﬂux in a strongly
unipolar background.

– 3 –

In their analysis of continual intermittent outﬂow observed in AR loops with the Transi-
tion Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE), Winebarger et al. (2001) conjectured that the
ﬂows were driven by small-scale reconnection events, but found no evidence for underlying
ﬂux cancellation in MDI magnetograms. Similarly, Aschwanden et al. (2007) mentioned as
a “caveat” against the chromospheric evaporation scenario “the nondetection of the initial
heating agent (small-scale reconnection events in the transition region)”. More recently, in
their observational study of the relation between magnetic structures and signatures of heat-
ing in a plage region, Anan et al. (2021) found that the fraction of opposite-polarity ﬁelds
was too small to support reconnection mechanisms, except possibly in the “strong guide-ﬁeld
regime.”

However, we have recently come to question the reliability of present-day magnetograms
in detecting minority-polarity ﬂux in the presence of a strongly dominant polarity. In an
analysis of coronal EUV plumes employing data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO), Wang et al. (2016) found that strong plume emission sometimes occurred above
network concentrations that were purely unipolar according to the HMI magnetograms, but
the corresponding AIA images clearly showed small, looplike structures in the cores of the
plumes. In subsequent studies focusing on unipolar plage areas, Wang (2016) and Wang et
al. (2019) identiﬁed large numbers of looplike features embedded within the plages, some
having the inverted-Y topology characteristic of jets. The footpoint structures had horizontal
extents of ∼2′′–7′′ (∼1.5–5 Mm), greatly exceeding the HMI pixel size of 0.5′′; the absence of
corresponding minority-polarity signatures thus appears to be related to the magnetograph’s
sensitivity to weak signals when one polarity is heavily dominant, and not simply the result
of inadequate spatial resolution.

Analyzing ∼0.1′′-resolution measurements of an emerging AR from the SUNRISE Imag-
ing Magnetograph Experiment (IMaX), Chitta et al. (2017) found that the footpoints of coro-
nal loops were often located near minority-polarity ﬂux that was invisible or barely visible
in the corresponding lower-resolution HMI magnetograms. However, the minority-polarity
elements detected with IMaX were conﬁned to the edges of the strong plage areas, whereas
the small looplike features identiﬁed in Wang (2016) and Wang et al. (2016, 2019) were
located well inside the supposedly unipolar plages and network concentrations, as well as at
their peripheries.

In this paper, we describe more examples of looplike features and compact brightenings
at the footpoints of AR loops embedded in “unipolar” plages, and discuss the nature and
origin of the small loops and their relationship to AR moss. We then argue that they provide
an energy ﬂux suﬃcient to heat the AR corona.

2. The Energization of AR Loops by Footpoint Reconnection: SDO

Observations

The AIA instrument records full-disk images in seven EUV channels, with 0.6′′ pixels
and 12 s cadence, as well as in two UV and a white-light channel. HMI provides line-of-
sight magnetograms every 45 s, with a noise level of ∼10 G. For this study, we employ AIA
images taken in three passbands: 17.1 nm, dominated by Fe IX (T ∼ 0.7–0.8 MK), 19.3
nm, dominated by Fe XII (T ∼ 1.5–1.6 MK), and 21.1 nm, dominated by Fe XIV (T ∼ 1.9–
2.0 MK). The AIA and HMI images were coaligned using the IDL procedures read sdo and
aia prep from the SolarSoft library.

2.1. NOAA 12443: 2015 November 5

As our ﬁrst illustrative example, Figure 1 shows an evolving collection of AR loops inside
NOAA 12243, as they appear in the 17.1 and 19.3 nm passbands late on 2015 November 5.
The loops are rooted in purely positive-polarity plage according to the magnetograms in the
rightmost column. As seen most clearly in the 17.1 nm images, small, curved structures with
dimensions of a few arcseconds are present at and around the footpoints of the longer loops.
The looplike ﬁne structure appears to be an integral part of the 17.1 nm moss that overlies the
plage area. The intensity of the reticulated moss shows substantial spatial variations, being
considerably brighter inside the circled area and in the foreground of the images than in the
intervening region, which is partially covered by dark ﬁlamentary material. The footpoint
structures and the overlying emission are also visible in the 19.3 nm images, but are much
more diﬀuse.

The reticulated, spongy morphology of the 17.1 nm moss is partly due to the presence of
cool chromospheric jets (De Pontieu et al., 1999, 2009), which may take the form of “dynamic
ﬁbrils,” mottles, and/or spicules (see, e.g., Hansteen et al., 2006; Tsiropoula and Tziotziou,
2004); these inclusions give rise to the dark “holes” seen in the moss.
In some cases, a
curved feature appearing at the base of an AR loop may be a projection eﬀect caused by the
presence of foreground chromospheric material. However, small, bright, curved structures
are visible throughout the moss, and these combine with the dark inclusions to give the moss
its reticulated appearance.

– 5 –

2.2. NOAA 12351: 2015 May 23

The small 17.1 nm loops are often more easily discerned when the moss is viewed “at an
angle,” as when located at relatively high latitudes. Figure 2 shows an area of moss inside
a sheared, decaying AR (NOAA 12351) at latitude N22◦, as observed on 2015 May 23 in
Fe IX (left column) and Fe XII (middle column). A row of looplike features with dimensions
of a few arcseconds may be seen, for example, inside the large circle in the 17.1 nm image
recorded at 14:00 UTC. Some of these curved structures are embedded within the purely
negative-polarity plage, according to the corresponding HMI magnetogram at the far right.
However, inside the smaller circle at the southwest corner of the same 17.1 nm image, similar
looplike features are also present above a mixed-polarity area at the edge of the plage. This
tends to support the conjecture that the small structures inside the plage are indeed loops,
but that the magnetograms do not show the minority-polarity inclusions when the majority-
polarity ﬂux is strong and heavily dominant. We also note that the morphological similarity
between the 17.1 nm ﬁne structure inside and just outside the plage suggests that moss is
not conﬁned to plages (see also Figure 10 below).

The small looplike features are also visible in Fe XII 19.3 nm, as near the center of the
large circles in the images recorded at 14:00 and 14:30 UTC. This supports the idea that we
are observing coronal structures.

2.3. NOAA 12764: 2020 June 6

Figure 3 shows an AR loop system observed at high northern latitudes on 2020 June 6,
just after the start of solar cycle 25. Both ends of the loops are embedded in 17.1 nm moss.
In the original and sharpened 17.1 nm images, bright, curved features with dimensions of
∼5′′ are visible at the eastern ends (circled) of some of the loops; these features seem to
be located in purely negative-polarity plage, according to the HMI magnetogram (bottom
panel). The 21.1 nm image also shows compact brightenings within this plage area, although
their distribution diﬀers from that of the 17.1 nm structures.

2.4. NOAA 12823: 2021 May 13–14

Figure 4 shows the conﬁguration of 17.1 nm loops above a negative-polarity plage area,
as it evolves over a period of a day. Again, curved features with dimensions of several
Megameters are clearly visible at the base of the AR loops. In this case, however, some of
the footpoint loops have at least one leg located above the area of weaker, mixed-polarity

ﬁeld outside the unipolar plage.

– 6 –

2.5. NOAA 12783: 2020 November 21

In Figure 5, the western end of a bundle of AR loops is viewed “from above” (rather
than “from the side” as in the previous examples). The footpoints are located inside an
area of negative-polarity plage, and they are again accompanied by looplike ﬁne structure
and compact brightenings. Most of these small features appear to lie entirely within the
unipolar plage; however, in the 17.1 nm image recorded at 04:14 UTC (bottom left panel),
the hook-shaped extension of the AR loops ends in the mixed-polarity region just northward
of the plage, as indicated by the corresponding HMI magnetogram (bottom right panel).

Figure 6 shows the western end of another loop system situated just to the north of
that in Figure 5. Over a 23 minute period, compact brightenings at the base of the loops
give rise to a succession of narrow outﬂow streams or jets.

2.6. NOAA 12786: 2020 December 2

The sequence of 17.1 nm images in Figure 7 provides another example of continual jet-
like activity at the footpoints of AR loops rooted inside or at the edges of unipolar plage
areas. The collimated outﬂows originate from an ever-changing conﬁguration of compact
brightenings, some of which are recognizable as small loops.

2.7. NOAA 12791: 2020 December 10

The compact brightenings and jet-like outﬂows in unipolar plage areas may also be seen
at higher temperatures. The sequence of Fe XII 19.3 nm images in Figure 8 illustrates the
activity occurring at this location throughout the day. Again, some of the small footpoint
features appear to be embedded in ﬂux of a single polarity.

2.8. NOAA 12794: 2020 December 29

The transient loops in Figure 9 are connected to a large, negative-polarity sunspot
located to the west of the ﬁeld of view. The number, width, and intensity of the collimated
outﬂows vary throughout the day. The footpoint areas show complex, looplike ﬁne structure

– 7 –

that is clearly a constituent of the 17.1 nm moss. This ﬁne structure is present even where
the underlying ﬂux is weak and of mixed polarity, although most of the salt-and-pepper
areas are covered by dark ﬁbrilar material, which dominates the northern half of the 17.1
nm images.

3. Nature of the Footpoint Fine Structure: Ephemeral Regions, Granular

Motions, and Moss

According to Fisk (2005), open ﬂux random walks over the solar surface by undergoing
interchange reconnection with closed loops, and accumulates in areas where the density of
loops is lowest. This prediction was seemingly conﬁrmed by Abramenko et al.
(2006),
who found that the rate of ER emergence in MDI magnetograms was a factor of 2 lower
inside coronal holes than in the quiet Sun, and by Zhang et al. (2006), who found (using
magnetograms taken at the Big Bear Solar Observatory) that it was a factor of 3 lower.
Subsequently, however, Hagenaar et al. (2008) showed that this reduction applied to unipolar
regions in general, not just to coronal holes.

As suggested by the examples of the preceding section, the rate of ER emergence inside
AR plages is likely to be much greater than indicated by the magnetograms. Moreover, the
looplike ﬁne structure seen in the AIA images appears to be morphologically more or less the
same inside and just outside the “unipolar” plage areas, as illustrated by Figure 2, where it
is diﬃcult to identify the boundaries between the plage and the surrounding mixed-polarity
regions from the 17.1 nm images alone. We therefore infer that the rate of ER emergence is
similar inside and outside of unipolar areas, and given by that measured in quiet background
regions of the Sun.

The ubiquitous small-scale loops have horizontal extents of ∼2′′–7′′ and lifetimes of a few
minutes, which are of the same order as the spatiotemporal scales of the solar granulation
(∼2′′ and ∼5–10 minutes). The origin of bipoles with total ﬂuxes .1020 Mx, including
in particular ERs, is often attributed to a poorly understood “surface dynamo” that is
separate from the main solar dynamo associated with sunspots and ARs. Harvey et al.
(2007; see also Lites et al., 1996) have identiﬁed a patchy, nearly horizontal component of
the photospheric ﬁeld with scales ranging from their resolution limit of a few arcseconds
to ∼15′′. Although they did not observe these “seething” horizontal ﬁelds inside ARs and
in the magnetic network, we presume that they are also present there but too weak to be
detected, just as minority-polarity ﬂux is underdetected in these regions. As for their origin,
one possibility is that they are the lingering, widely dispersed remnants of AR ﬁelds that
have undergone only partial ﬂux cancellation and have not yet fully resubmerged. As shown

– 8 –

in Wang and Berger (2018), the component of the ﬁeld parallel to the polarity inversion lines
of ARs survives many rotations longer than the transverse component. These “axial” ﬁelds,
which are closely associated with the helicity of ARs, are only canceled/resubmerged after
the photospheric neutral lines have themselves been randomized on small scales through ﬂux
transport processes (see Figure 7 in Wang and Berger 2018).1

The pervasive presence of horizontal ﬁelds at or just below the solar surface would
provide a source for the small loops and ERs seen in the EUV images. These ﬁelds would be
continually churned and twisted by the granular convection, and the twisted small-scale ﬁelds
would continually transfer their energy to the larger coronal loops. As in most models for
coronal heating, granular motions are the basic energy source, but instead of acting directly
on the AR loops to generate Alfv´en waves or tangential discontinuities, the interaction is
mediated through the ubiquitous small-scale ﬁelds.

In the standard interpretation, moss represents the transition region of hot AR loops
(Berger et al., 1999). However, as already noted, comparison of Fe IX 17.1 nm images with
magnetograms suggests that moss is not conﬁned to strong plages (see also De Pontieu et
(1999, 2003), who found that the distribution of moss is poorly correlated with the
al.
Ca II K brightness, a proxy for the photospheric ﬁeld strength). Figure 10 shows another
example of moss-like structure overlying a region of relatively weak, mixed-polarity ﬁeld. In
our interpretation, moss consists mainly of small loops that are heated as their magnetic
energy is dissipated by interactions with the overlying loops. However, most quiet Sun areas
are covered by low-lying 17.1 nm ﬁbrils, which form dark canopies surrounding ARs; these
“circumfacular” regions have long been observed at visible wavelengths such as Ca II K (Hale
and Ellerman, 1903; St. John, 1911) and Hα (e.g., Howard and Harvey, 1964). As suggested
in Wang et al. (2011), the dark ﬁbrils tend to form where the photospheric ﬁeld is weak and
of mixed polarity and the overlying large-scale coronal ﬁeld has a horizontal orientation, as
at the edges of ﬂux concentrations; in this case, reconnection produces cool, dense, low-lying
loops which may eventually evolve into ﬁlaments.

1The axisymmetric (longitude-independent) component of the photospheric ﬁeld, which is the source
of the polar ﬁelds, is also extremely long-lived because it is unaﬀected by diﬀerential rotation and decays
on the supergranular diﬀusion timescale. However, this component would not contribute to the relatively
small-scale, horizontal background ﬁelds in question.

4. Estimating the Contribution of ERs to Coronal Heating in ARs

Following a procedure similar to that applied to coronal holes in Wang (2020), we now
estimate the energy ﬂux associated with the emergence of ERs (or the continual churning of
horizontal ﬁelds) inside AR plages.

We take as our starting point the MDI measurements of Hagenaar et al. (2008, 2010),
who found that the rate of ER emergence depended on the ﬂux imbalance parameter ξ ≡
Φnet/Φabs, where Φnet (Φabs) represents the signed (unsigned) ﬂux summed over a 92×92
Mm2 area surrounding the ERs. Their result may be expressed as

EER(ξ) ≃ (1.075 − 0.793ξ2) × 10

−3 Mx cm

−2 s

−1.

(1)

The measurements were based on 5 minute averages of line-of-sight magnetograms with 2′′
pixels, with the individual ERs having total unsigned ﬂuxes ΦER & 4 × 1018 Mx.

Based on the discussion of the preceding sections, we assume that the ER emergence
rate is the same in unipolar regions and AR plages as in mixed-polarity areas of the quiet
Sun, and henceforth set ξ = 0. In addition, we apply two further corrections. First, following
Tran et al. (2005), who cross-correlated MDI data with saturation-corrected magnetograms
from the Mount Wilson Observatory, we scale the measured MDI ﬂuxes upward by a factor
of 1.7. Second, we allow for the contribution of ERs with total ﬂuxes down to ΦER ∼ 1 ×1018
Mx.

The rate of small-scale ﬂux emergence, in the form of ERs and intranetwork ﬂux, is
known to exhibit an exponential or power-law dependence that continues to increase toward
smaller spatiotemporal scales (see, e.g., Thornton and Parnell, 2011; Zhou et al., 2013).
Because our focus is on reconnection events occurring in the corona, we include only the
contribution of bipoles whose scale sizes exceed ∼2 Mm. According to Hagenaar (2001),
an ER having a total ﬂux of ΦER = 1.13 × 1019 Mx (or 1.92 × 1019 Mx when corrected
for line proﬁle saturation) has an average pole separation dER of ∼8.9 Mm. Assuming that
dER ∝ Φ1/2
ER (following Cranmer and van Ballegooijen, 2010) and taking the vertical scale size
hER of an ER to be comparable to its pole separation, we may write

hER ∼ 2.0 Mm

1/2

ΦER
1 × 1018 Mx (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

(2)

This means that ERs with ﬂuxes ΦER & 1018 Mx will have loop systems that extend to
heights above ∼2 Mm, the approximate location of the coronal base.

Although they were unable to extend their ER measurements below ﬂuxes of ∼4 × 1018
Mx, Hagenaar et al. (2003) showed that the number of emerging ERs as a function of ΦER

– 10 –

could be ﬁtted with an exponential of the form NER(ΦER) ∝ exp[−ΦER/(5 × 1018 Mx)] (see
their Figure 6). Scaling the ﬂuxes upward by 1.7, it follows that

EER(ΦER & 1×1018 Mx) ≃ 1.23 EER(ΦER & 6.8×1018 Mx) ≃ 2.25×10−3 Mx cm−2 s−1. (3)

(2020), and Anan et al.

The ERs emerging within a plage will undergo reconnection with the overlying AR
loops. According to recent spectropolarimetric analyses of plage regions by Morosin et al.
(2021), the strength of the longitudinal
(2020), Pietrow et al.
ﬁeld component in the chromosphere (at heights of up to ∼1 Mm, where the canopy has
fully formed) is typically on the order of 400 G. Assuming that the ﬁeld strength at the
coronal base, B0, is comparable to that in the upper chromosphere, we therefore normalize
our estimates to B0 ∼ 400 G. The recycling time or timescale for an equal amount of
minority-polarity ﬂux to emerge under the plage ﬁeld is given by

τrecyc ∼

EER(ΦER & 1 × 1018 Mx) (cid:21)

.

(4)

Over this ﬂux replacement time, all of the AR ﬂux will have undergone reconnection with
the ERs, with magnetic energy being dissipated in a layer whose thickness is determined by
the heights of the ER loops. Denoting the average loop height by hhERi, we obtain for the
energy ﬂux density arising from footpoint reconnection:

FER ∼

EER(ΦER & 1 × 1018 Mx)
2.25 × 10−3 Mx cm−2 s−1 (cid:21)

.

(5)
Here, the average loop height has been normalized to the value corresponding to ΦER =
1 × 1019 Mx in Equation (2). The estimated energy ﬂux density is close to the value of
∼107 erg cm−2 s−1 given by Withbroe and Noyes (1977) for the sum of the radiative and
conductive energy losses in the AR corona.

The above estimate is based on the rate of ER emergence in the quiet Sun measured by
Hagenaar et al. (2008, 2010). According to Figure 6 of Hagenaar et al. (2008), this rate and
thus the recycling time are sensitive to the cadence of the magnetograms employed: as the
interval ∆t between successive magnetograms decreased from ∼1 hr to ∼5 minutes, τrecyc
decreased from ∼13 to ∼1.5 hr. This raises the possibility that EER and thus FER would have
been even larger had Hagenaar et al. used magnetograms taken less than 5 minutes apart.
In the preceding section, we conjectured that ERs may have their origin in the churning of
ubiquitous horizontal background ﬁelds by the solar granulation; if so, ∆t ∼ 5 minutes might
turn out to be the appropriate timescale. However, this remains an important question that
needs to be addressed by additional measurements.

– 11 –

The energy released in the reconnection events will be in the form of ohmic heating, jets,
and MHD waves. The heat deposited near the coronal base is conducted both upward into
the corona and downward through the transition region, with the resulting chromospheric
evaporation acting to ﬁll the AR loop with hot, dense material. We have here shown many
examples of upﬂows, jets, and/or outward-propagating intensity fronts that originate from
compact brightenings at the footpoints of AR loops. Winebarger et al. (2001) identiﬁed
such upﬂows in TRACE 17.1 nm images of a bundle of loops in NOAA 8395, measuring
projected speeds of 5–17 km s−1 for the intensity fronts. They conjectured that the ﬂows
were related to reconnection events, but found no evidence of ﬂux cancellation in MDI
magnetograms, presumably for the same reason(s) that the HMI magnetograms show no
underlying minority-polarity ﬂux in many of our examples.

As discussed by Warren et al. (2002, 2003), Winebarger et al. (2003), and Aschwanden
et al. (2007), impulsive heating at the footpoints of AR loops also explains their orders-
of-magnitude overdensity compared to that predicted by static loop models, the absence of
signiﬁcant temperature variations along the lengths of coronal loops (Lenz et al., 1999), as
well as observations showing that loops initially appear at high temperatures before cooling
to successively lower temperatures (see, e.g., Ugarte-Urra et al., 2006, 2009). The ﬁnding
that the measured lifetimes of the loops are generally longer than their cooling timescales is
consistent with AIA observations suggesting that a given AR loop may undergo a succession
of interactions with the underlying small-scale features over periods of up to an hour or more
(see, e.g., Figures 7–9).

Figure 1 in Wang et al. (2019) illustrates the evolution of an inverted-Y structure as
observed in Fe IX 17.1 nm and Fe XIV 21.1 nm during 2013 April 30. The structure is
rooted in a purely unipolar (according to the HMI magnetograms) plage area inside NOAA
11731. The outﬂow from the brightened, triangular base area is ﬁrst seen in Fe XIV, and
then in Fe IX after a lag of ∼10 minutes. Maintaining this time lag, both outﬂows reach
their maximum intensity after ∼10 minutes and then fade more gradually over the next
∼20 minutes. Warren et al. (2002, 2003) modeled the evolution of TRACE loops observed
simultaneously in the 17.1, 19.5, and 28.4 nm ﬁlters as involving multiple isothermal threads,
with the threads having undergone impulsive footpoint heating at diﬀerent times and being in
diﬀerent stages of cooling at any given time. Such a multi-thread model would be consistent
with the complex topology expected of the small-scale footpoint ﬁelds as they are continually
churned by granular motions and undergo reconnection with the overlying large-scale coronal
ﬁeld. The outﬂow example just described would suggest a well-deﬁned onset time for the
reconnection (perhaps associated with the emergence of an ER), followed by a succession of
smaller events over a period of tens of minutes.

Reconnection between the AR loops and ER loops extending to heights &2 Mm will also
give rise to MHD waves originating near the coronal base. In the model of van Ballegooijen
et al. (2011), a small fraction of the Alfv´en waves generated by small-scale photospheric
convective motions leaks into the corona; the waves are trapped inside the loop due to the
steep gradients in the transition region at each end, interact with each other, and undergo
turbulent dissipation. A similar scenario may apply if the Alfv´en waves are generated by
reconnection near the coronal base. Because the Alfv´en crossing times in the corona are
much shorter than the granular convection timescales on which the reconnection is driven,
resonant interactions (not considered by van Ballegooijen et al.) may also occur between
the trapped waves. However, in contrast to most models that invoke wave dissipation or
nanoﬂares/braiding, we are here in a regime involving strongly antiparallel ﬁelds. We would
thus expect the main energy release to be in the form of ohmic heating at the reconnection
site, followed by heat conduction upward and downward along the coronal loop and the
evaporation of material from the top of the chromosphere, as in solar ﬂares.

5. Summary and Discussion

Although sometimes still advocated (see, e.g., Priest et al., 2018; Syntelis and Priest,
2020), reconnection with small-scale ﬁelds or the “magnetic carpet” appears to have fallen
out of favor as a major coronal heating mechanism. Perhaps the main reason for this neglect
is the near-absence of minority-polarity ﬂux inside AR plages and strong network, according
to even high-resolution magnetograms. This study provides additional support for our earlier
conclusion that present-day magnetograms greatly underestimate the amount of minority-
polarity ﬂux at the footpoints of AR loops (Wang, 2016; Wang et al., 2019), and suggests
that the reconnection rate is suﬃcient to heat the AR corona. The failure to detect the
minority-polarity ﬂux may indicate a problem with instrument sensitivity when one polarity
is heavily dominant and the minority-polarity signal is close to the nominal ∼10 G noise
level.

One of the important points made here (see, e.g., Figures 2 and 10) and in our previous
studies is that the spatial distribution and morphological appearance of looplike ﬁne structure
in 17.1 and 19.3 nm images seem to be the same inside and just outside “unipolar” regions.
This absence of a well deﬁned boundary for the “moss” leads us to infer that the rate of
small-scale ﬂux emergence (or churning of small-scale ﬁelds by granular convection) is similar
everywhere on the Sun, irrespective of the local degree of unipolarity.

Taking the emergence rate to be the same as that measured by Hagenaar et al. (2008,
2010) for ERs outside of unipolar areas, we have estimated the energy ﬂux density due

– 13 –

to reconnection with plage ﬁelds, FER, to be on the order of 107 erg cm−2 s−1, enough to
account for the heating of the AR corona. In general, FER ∝ (B2
0/8π)/τrecyc ∝ B0, where
B0 is the ﬁeld strength at the coronal base and τrecyc ∝ B0 is the timescale for all of the
ﬂux to undergo reconnection with ERs. Inside coronal holes, where B0 ∼ 10 G instead of
∼300–400 G, FER ∼ 3 × 105 erg cm−2 s−1, which is suﬃcient to heat the hole and drive
the solar wind. Using energy conservation along a ﬂux tube and tracing from Earth back to
the solar surface, we have veriﬁed that the observed solar-wind energy ﬂux density (which is
dominated at 1 au by the kinetic energy of the bulk ﬂow, ρv3/2) is indeed proportional to
the ﬁeld strength at the coronal base (Wang, 2010, 2020).

Although we have been concerned here only with the heating of the corona, it may be
that mixed-polarity ﬂux on even smaller scales plays an important part in chromospheric
heating, given the power law distribution of ﬂux emergence. In their high-resolution spec-
tropolarimetric study of chromospheric heating in a plage region, Anan et al. (2021) found
that the Mg II radiative ﬂux (a measure of the heating rate) was highest in between or at
the edges of the individual strong ﬁeld patches within the plage, and was poorly correlated
with the local chromospheric or photospheric ﬁeld strength. Reconnection with small bipoles
scattered through the plage might account for such oﬀ-center heating.

Our key prediction is that, rather than simply representing the transition region of hot
AR loops, “moss” actually contains small loops that undergo continual interactions with
the overlying coronal loops and are responsible for their heating. The Extreme Ultraviolet
Imager and the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on Solar Orbiter may soon provide
In addition, we anticipate that the Daniel K. In-

ouye Solar Telescope’s spectropolarimeters, with their unprecedented sensitivity and spatial
resolution, will help us to understand better the nature of the plage ﬁelds.

Fig. 1.— A cluster of coronal loops observed inside NOAA 12443 late on 2015 November 5.
Circled area has radius 15′′. The Fe IX 17.1 nm (left column) and Fe XII 19.3 nm (middle
column) loops are rooted in moss overlying a plage area containing only positive-polarity
ﬂux, according to the corresponding HMI magnetograms (right column). The brightness
and spatial distribution of the 17.1 nm loops vary continually over the 5 hr period, as does
the underlying ﬁne structure, which, in addition to dark chromospheric material, consists of
looplike features and compact brightenings that appear to be an integral part of the moss.
The emission is more diﬀuse and widespread in the 19.3 nm images (recorded 5 s before the
17.1 nm images), but the brightenings are still visible at the loop footpoints. Movies suggest
that the fading of the Fe IX loops is often accompanied by downﬂows (see the animation
accompanying Figure 10 in Wang et al., 2019). Here and in subsequent ﬁgures, the gray scale
used in the magnetograms is as follows: white (Blos > 30 G); light gray (0 G < Blos < 30
G); dark gray (−30 G < Blos < 0 G); black (Blos < −30 G).

as observed on 2015 May 23. Left column: Fe IX 17.1 nm images recorded at 12:17:35,
14:00:11, 14:30:11, and 19:27:23 UTC. Middle column: Fe X11 19.3 nm images recorded
at 12:17:30, 14:00:06, 14:30:06, and 19:27:18 UTC. Right column: line-of-sight HMI magne-

An unsharp mask has been applied to the EUV images. Note that the moss-like structure
and looplike features extend into the mixed-polarity, weaker-ﬁeld areas beyond the plage
itself, as indicated for example by the circled region at the southwest corner of the images.
Loop-shaped structures with dimensions of a few arcseconds may be discerned not only in
Fe IX but also in Fe XII, as near the center of the large circles in the 19.3 nm images taken
at 14:00 and 14:30 UTC.

Fig. 4.— Evolution of 17.1 nm loops inside NOAA 12823, 2021 May 13–14. As the underlying
plage area narrows, the cluster of AR loops present late on May 13 fades and is replaced
by a smaller bundle on May 14. Relatively large (&5′′) looplike features may be seen at
the base of the AR loops; some of these footpoint structures have at least one leg located
above the weak, mixed-polarity region on the west side of the negative-polarity plage. The
magnetograms in the rightmost column have been saturated at ±10 G instead of ±30 G (as
in the middle column), so that light and dark gray pixels here indicate locations where Blos
is close to the HMI noise level.

Fig. 7.— More examples of 17.1 nm AR loops with compact brightenings at their bases.
The loops in this case are rooted in and around a unipolar plage area inside NOAA 12786.
Again, bright jet-like outﬂows may be seen emanating from many of the footpoint features.

Fig. 8.— Compact brightenings at the footpoints of Fe XII 19.3 nm loops in NOAA 12791,
2020 December 10. Again, the footpoint brightenings are accompanied by jet-like outﬂows,
and some of the compact features appear to be embedded in purely unipolar ﬂux.

Fig. 10.— An example of 17.1 nm “moss” overlying an area of relatively weak photospheric
ﬁeld. The obvious presence of mixed-polarity ﬂux in this case supports the idea that small
loops are a major constituent of moss, including that observed in “unipolar” plage areas.
(See also Figure 2, where the small circles highlight moss- and looplike structure extending
beyond the edge of the plage.)
