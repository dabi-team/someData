MORITA THEOREM FOR HEREDITARY CALABI-YAU CATEGORIES

NORIHIRO HANIHARA

Abstract. We give a structure theorem for Calabi-Yau triangulated category with a hereditary cluster tilting
object. We prove that an algebraic d-Calabi-Yau triangulated category with a d-cluster tilting object T such
that its shifted sum T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)] has hereditary endomorphism algebra H is triangle equivalent to the
orbit category D b(mod H)/τ −1/(d−1)[1] of the derived category of H for a naturally deﬁned (d − 1)-st root
τ 1/(d−1) of the AR translation, provided H is of non-Dynkin type. We also show that hereditaryness of H
follows from that of T when d = 3, that of T ⊕ T [−1] when d = 4, and similarly from a smaller endomorphism
algebra for higher dimensions under vanishing of some negative self-extensions of T . Our result therefore
generalizes the established theorems by Keller–Reiten and Keller–Murfet–Van den Bergh. Furthermore, we
show that enhancements of such triangulated categories are unique. Finally we apply our results to Calabi-Yau
reductions of a higher cluster category of a ﬁnite dimensional algebra and of the singularity category of an
invariant subring.

1. Introduction

Calabi-Yau (CY) triangulated categories have been of great importance in various areas of mathematics.
A triangulated category T is d-CY if it has ﬁnite dimensional morphism spaces over a ﬁeld k, and the d-th
suspension [d] is the Serre functor on T , that is, we have functorial isomorphisms

T (A, B) ≃ DT (B, A[d])

for all A, B ∈ T , where D = Homk(−, k). In representation theory, CY triangulated categories with cluster
tilting objects are of particular interest [Ke4]. One of the foundations of recent developments on this subject
was given in the context of categoriﬁcation of Fomin–Zelevinsky’s cluster algebras [FZ] by Buan–Marsh–
Reineke–Reiten–Todorov [BMRRT]. Generalizing their construction, the d-cluster category of a hereditary
algebra H is the orbit category

D b(mod H)/τ −1[d − 1].

It is a d-CY triangulated category [Ke2] equipped with a d-cluster tilting object [IYo].

NORIHIRO HANIHARA

The subject of this paper is Morita-type theorem for CY categories. Most classically, Morita theory gives
a characterization of module categories among abelian categories in terms of projective generators [Ga]. Sim-
ilarly, its version for triangulated categories speciﬁes derived categories in terms of tilting objects [Ke1]. We
investigate its analogue for CY triangulated categories, which attempts to characterize cluster categories in
terms of cluster tilting objects.

The only known results on such Morita-type theorems are the following two, due to Keller–Reiten and

Keller–Murfet–Van den Bergh.
Theorem 1.1. Let T be an algebraic d-CY triangulated category with a d-cluster tilting object T .

(1) [KR] Suppose EndT (T ) = kQ for some acyclic quiver Q, and T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < d − 1.

Then there exists a triangle equivalence T ≃ D b(mod kQ)/τ −1[d − 1].

(2) [KMV] Suppose d = 2n + 1 ≥ 3, EndT (T ) = k, and T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n. Put
dimk HomT (T, T [−n]) = m. Then there exists a triangle equivalence T ≃ D b(mod kQm)/τ −1/2[n]
4 ◦ with m arrows, and a naturally deﬁned square root τ 1/2
for the m-Kronecker quiver Qm : ◦
of the AR translation.

❴*

This paper is devoted to prove the following result which encompasses both of the above two cases, provid-
ing a general Morita-type theorem for CY categories arising from representation-inﬁnite hereditary algebras.
Recall that a hereditary algebra is 1-representation inﬁnite if any of its ring indecomposable summand is
representation-inﬁnite. Also we denote by JΛ the Jacobson radical of a ring Λ.
Theorem 1.2 (=4.13). Let d ≥ 2 and let T be an algebraic d-CY triangulated category with a d-cluster tilting
object T . Assume that H = EndT (T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]) is 1-representation inﬁnite and that H/JH
is separable over k. Then there exists a triangle equivalence

T ≃ D b(mod H)/τ −1/(d−1)[1]
for a naturally deﬁned (d − 1)-st root τ 1/(d−1) of the AR translation.

We also give a certain converse in Section 6. We show that if H has a (d − 1)-st root of τ , then there exists

Our (d − 1)-st root τ −1/(d−1) is deﬁned by − ⊗L

a projective H-module P such that P ⊕ τ −1/(d−1)P ⊕ · · · ⊕ τ −(d−2)/(d−1)P ≃ H, justifying our choice of H.
H U for the (H, H)-bimodule U = T (X, X[−1]) where
X = T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]. We show that the (d − 1)-fold derived tensor product of U is isomorphic to
Ext1
H U = τ −1/(d−1). A square root of the AR translation for
generalized Kronecker quivers appears in [KMV]. More general roots of (higher) AR translations for various
algebras are studied in [Han2].

H (DH, H) (4.10), thus one can write − ⊗L

The main theorem recovers both of the known results in 1.1 for the inﬁnite type. When d = 2 this
immediately gives Keller–Reiten’s recognition theorem 1.1(1) for the case Q is of non-Dynkin type. Also when
d = 3 and EndT (T ) = k, then H is the path algebra of a generalized Kronecker quiver, thus we deduce
Keller–Murfet–Van den Bergh’s theorem 1.1(2) for m ≥ 2. We can also recover the versions for arbitrary d in
1.1, despite the seemingly diﬀerent assumption and conclusion; see the second paragraph after 1.4.

Even if H is of Dynkin type we have a partial result. For arbitrary hereditary H there is an additive

equivalence (4.5)

T /[T [1] ⊕ T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]] ≃ mod H,
which gives a classiﬁcation ind T ≃ ind(mod H) ⊔ ind(add T [1]) of objects of T , as 1.2 implies for non-Dynkin
cases. Here ind C means the set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects in an additive category
C . In particular, the triangulated category T has ﬁnitely many indecomposable objects up to isomorphism
when H is of Dynkin type. For such a triangulated category its structure is deeply known, see for example
[XZ, Am1, Ke6, Han1, M].

Furthermore, we remark that our proof of the main result in fact gives the uniqueness of enhancements for
triangulated categories as in 1.2, in particular for the (usual) cluster category D b(mod kQ)/τ −1[d − 1] of a
quiver Q. See 4.18 for the deﬁnition of enhancements and a precise statement. We refer to [LO, An, M, CNS],
and references therein, for various established results on uniqueness of enhancements.

Although the assumption in 1.2 that H = EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]) is hereditary looks strong, it in
fact follows from the same property for a smaller algebra, in particular, from that of T when d = 3. More

generally, we have the following suﬃcient condition for H to be hereditary using vanishing of some negative
self-extensions of T .

Theorem 1.3. Let T be a d-CY triangulated category with a d-cluster tilting object T .

(1) (=2.8) Suppose T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < d/2 and H ′ = EndT (T ) is hereditary. Then we have
T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < d − 1, thus EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]) is the direct product of (d − 1)
copies of H ′, hence is hereditary.

(2) (=2.12) Suppose d = 2n + 1 ≥ 3, T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n, and EndT (T ) is hereditary. Then
EndT (T ⊕ T [−n]) is hereditary, and EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(2n − 1)]) is the direct product of n copies
of it, hence is hereditary.

(3) (=2.21) Suppose d = 2n + 2 ≥ 4, T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n, and EndT (T ⊕ T [−n]) is hereditary.

Then H = EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n]) is also hereditary.

Note that we are allowing T (T, T [−n]) to survive in (2) and (3) while it is supposed to vanish in (1).
One can thus view (1) as a ‘degenerate’ version of (2) and (3). We also explicitly describe the quiver of
EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]) for (2) and (3) in terms of AR sequences in add T , see 2.13 and 2.22.

Combining 1.2 and 1.3, together with an interpretation of (d − 1)-th root of the AR translation for (1) and

(2) which we explain below, we obtain the following version of 1.2.

Corollary 1.4. Let T be an algebraic d-CY triangulated category with a d-cluster tilting object T .

(1) (=4.14) Suppose H ′ = EndT (T ) is hereditary and T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < d/2. Then there exists

a triangle equivalence

T ≃ D b(mod H ′)/τ −1[d − 1]

when H ′ is 1-representation inﬁnite and H ′/JH′ is separable over k.

(2) (=4.15) Suppose d = 2n + 1 ≥ 3, EndT (T ) is hereditary, and T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n. Then

H ′ = EndT (T ⊕ T [−n]) is hereditary, and there exists a triangle equivalence

T ≃ D b(mod H ′)/τ −1/2[n]

when H ′ is 1-representation inﬁnite and H ′/JH′ is separable over k.

(3) (=4.16) Suppose d = 2n + 2 ≥ 4, T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n, and EndT (T ⊕ T [−n]) is hereditary.

Then H = EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n]) is hereditary, and there exists a triangle equivalence

when H is 1-representation inﬁnite and H/JH is separable over k.

T ≃ D b(mod H)/τ −1/(2n+1)[1]

The above (1) shows that we in fact need only half of the vanishings of negative extensions in 1.1(1).
Also (2) reduces to Keller–Murfet–Van den Bergh’s theorem 1.1(2) when EndT (T ) = k as well as relaxes the
assumption on the vanishing of negative extensions in Keller–Reiten’s theorem 1.1(1). This 1.4(2) is thus a
common generalization of 1.1(1)(2). Let us summarize the implications diagrammatically.

T (T,T [−n])=0

1.4(2)

3 1.4(1)

T (T,T [−n])=0

1.4(3)

EndT (T )=k

[KMV]: 1.1(2)

[KR]: 1.1(1)

Now we brieﬂy explain how to deduce the corollaries in 1.4 from 1.2 and the respective results in 1.3. It
depends on an interpretation of the (d − 1)-st root τ 1/(d−1). Under the assumption of 1.4(1), the algebra
H = EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]) in 1.2 is the direct product of (d − 1) copies of EndT (T ) =: H ′ by 1.3(1). It
turns out, under the identiﬁcation D b(mod H) = D b(mod H ′) × · · · × D b(mod H ′), that our (d − 1)-st root is
given just by τ 1/(d−1) : (L1, . . . , Ld−1) 7→ (L2, . . . , Ld−1, τ ′L1) using the AR translation τ ′ of H ′. This yields
an equivalence of orbit categories (5.2)

D b(mod H)/τ −1/(d−1)[1] ≃ D b(mod H ′)/τ ′−1[d − 1],
which gives 1.4(1). A similar interpretation of 2n-th root of H in terms of a square root for H ′ yields 1.4(2).
Note that in 1.4(3) the (2n + 1)-st root cannot be made easier in general.

Let us now mention one intermediate result toward proving 1.2 which is a general consideration on realizing
a triangulated category as a cluster category. It is based on a description of cluster categories in terms of
diﬀerential graded (dg) algebras [Ke3]. Recall that a dg algebra Π is homologically smooth if Π is perfect as a
bimodule. In this case we have that D b(Π), the derived category of dg Π-modules of ﬁnite dimensional total
cohomology, is contained in the perfect derived category per Π. For a homologically smooth dg algebra Π, we
call the Verdier quotient

C (Π) := per Π/D b(Π)
the cluster category of Π. The theory on such kind of categories was established by Amiot [Am2] and generalized
in [Gu] for CY dg algebras [Gi, Ke5], giving rise to CY triangulated categories with cluster tilting objects. We
refer to [AMY, ART, AIR, AO1, AO2, AO3, BT, FM, Han2, IQ, IO, IYa, KY1, KY2, KY3, Ke5, Ki, KQ, Pl,
Pr, TV] for further studies on this subject. Although the cluster category in the above general sense is not
CY nor have cluster tilting objects, those for certain non-CY dg algebras will be important for us.

Let T be a triangulated category and X ∈ T satisfying the following.
(a) T is Hom-ﬁnite over k and thickT X = T .
(b) If T (X, Y [i]) = 0 for i ≪ 0 then Y = 0.
(c) There exists an enhancement A of T such that the truncated derived endomorphism algebra Π :=

RHomA (X, X)≤0 is homologically smooth.

For example if X ∈ T is a d-cluster tilting object for some d ≥ 1, then the above (b) indeed holds (see 3.2).
In this situation we can realize our triangulated category T as a cluster category of Π in (c).

Theorem 1.5 (=3.3). Let T be a triangulated category satisfying (a), (b), and (c) above. Then T is triangle
equivalent to the cluster category of Π.

Our main result 1.2 is obtained as an application of this observation together with a description of C (Π)
as an orbit category of a derived category (see 3.1) and our method is thus quite diﬀerent from those in 1.1.
It should be noted that a similar result on realizing a triangulated category as a cluster category is obtained
in [KY3], in the setting where T is CY and X ∈ T is cluster tilting. It would be interesting to investigate
the relationship of these results. We refer also to [T] for another result based on a diﬀerent model.

sions. He is also grateful to Bernhard Keller for stimulating comments and discussions.

2. Hereditaryness of shifted sum of cluster tilting objects

Let T be a d-CY triangulated category with a d-cluster tilting object T . While the object T , if EndT (T )
is hereditary, alone can recover the category T when d = 2, the same does not hold in higher dimensions.
Our generator for larger d is the shifted sum X = T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)] of T which, if EndT (X) is hereditary,
turns out to be essential to recover the triangulated category T , see 4.13.

The aim of this section is to give a suﬃcient condition for EndT (X) to be hereditary in terms of much
smaller endomorphism algebra under some vanishing of negative self-extensions of T (2.12 and 2.21). Moreover
we explicitly describe the quiver of EndT (X) in each case (2.13 and 2.22).

2.1. Rigid objects with hereditary endomorphism algebras. Some part of our discussion does not
depend on the setup of cluster tilting object in a CY triangulated category. Let T be a triangulated category
and T ∈ T . For each indecomposable summand Ta of T , deﬁne the objects A(i)

Let us note some consequences of this inductive construction of sink maps.

Lemma 2.2. Let m ≥ 1 and T ∈ T an m-rigid object such that EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(m − 1)]) is hereditary.

(1) The map ai : A(i)

a → S(i)
a

induces an injection T (T, A(i)

a ) ֒→ T (T, S(i)

a ) for each 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1, hence

an isomorphism for 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1.

(2) The maps fi : A(i)

a → A(i−1)

a

are 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m.

Proof. Since the assumptions on T for m implies the same for any smaller m, it is enough to prove the
assertions for the largest possible i, that is, i = m − 1 for (1) and i = m for (2). We can apply 2.1 for m − 1,
so there is a triangle

understand Y0 = C0 and Yd = Cd+1,

• each Ci → Ci+1 is a radical map.

We call the above sequence an AR (d + 2)-angle in C . Moreover, it satisﬁes the following.

(1) For each 1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1, the morphism fi is a minimal left C -approximation and gi is a minimal right

C -approximation.

In particular if T is d-CY the AR (d + 2)-angles have the same end terms, say C. In this case we call it

Now assume that T is d-CY and T ∈ T is d-cluster tilting such that EndT (T ) is hereditary. We denote
by Ta the indecomposable direct summand of T corresponding to the vertex a of the quiver Q of EndT (T ).
For each vertex a, deﬁne the objects Sa, Ua ∈ T by the triangles

We note an easy observation on these sink and source maps.

Lemma 2.7. Suppose T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n. Then for each 0 < i ≤ n, there are exact sequences

In particular, T (T, Sa[−i]) = 0 and T (Ua[i], T ) = 0 for each vertex a and 0 < i < n.

`

Proof. We only prove the statement for Sa. By the deﬁning triangle for Sa and vanishing of negative self-
extensions of T , we immediately have the exact sequence for 1 < i ≤ n. When i = 1, consider the exact
sequence

T (T,

in which the last map is injective since it is the sink map in add T and EndT (T ) is hereditary. This proves
(cid:3)
our assertion.

`

Let us also mention that vanishing of negative extensions up to a half of d automatically yields the vanishing

for the other half, which allows us to weaken the vanishing assumption in Keller–Reiten’s theorem 1.1(1).

Proposition 2.8. Suppose T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i ≤ (d − 1)/2. Then T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < d − 1.

Proof. Consider the AR (d + 2)-angle at each indecomposable direct summand Ta of T .

Ta = Sa and we are done. Applying T (T, −) to the rightmost triangle, we have an exact sequence

in which the right term is 0 by the former claim, and the left term is 0 by the induction hypothesis. We

therefore conclude that T (T, Ta[−i]) = 0.

2.3. Odd CY triangulated category with a cluster titling object. We apply our general observations
of Section 2.1 to the setting of a CY triangulated category and a cluster tilting object. Let n ≥ 1 and let
T be a (2n + 1)-CY triangulated category with a (2n + 1)-cluster tilting object T such that EndT (T ) is
hereditary, and HomT (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n. Our proof shows that we can detect the structure of
H = EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(2n − 1)]) from the AR (2n + 3)-angles in add T . The following observation is
therefore fundamental.

Proposition 2.9. The AR (2n + 3)-angle at Ta is of the following form for some Aa ∈ add T .

We will refer to these AR (2n + 3)-angles as (AR).
The symmetry of AR sequences has the following consequences. Compare the ﬁrst one with 2.2(1).

Lemma 2.10. The map Aa → Sa[−n] in the middle triangle in (AR) induces an isomorphism T (T, Aa) ≃
T (T, Sa[−n]). In particular, the EndT (T )-module T (T, Sa[−n]) is projective.

Proof. The map is always surjective since Aa → Sa[−n] is a right (add T )-approximation. If n > 1, we see
T (T, Ua[n]) = 0 by the leftmost triangle in (AR), which gives injectivity. Now assume n = 1. In this case
(AR) has the form

Applying T (T, −) to the middle triangle in (AR) we have an exact sequence

T (T, Sa[−n − i]) = 0.

Applying T (T, −) to the rightmost triangle, we have an exact sequence

T (T,

b→a Tb[−j])

We therefore see by induction on the vertices of the quiver of EndT (T ) that T (T, Ta[−j]) = 0 (cf. proof of

NORIHIRO HANIHARA

Now we are ready to prove the ﬁrst main result of this section.

Theorem 2.12. Let n ≥ 1 and T be a (2n + 1)-CY triangulated category with a (2n + 1)-cluster tilting object
T . Suppose that EndT (T ) is hereditary and HomT (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n.

(1) The algebra H ′ = EndT (T ⊕ T [−n]) is hereditary.
(2) The algebra H = EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(2n − 1)]) is a direct product of n copies of H ′, thus is hereditary.

Proof. (2) follows from (1) and 2.11, so we prove (1). For this we show that any sink map in proj H ′ =
add(T ⊕ T [−n]) is a monomorphism. This is clear for the sink maps at objects in add T since there are no
non-zero morphisms from add T [−n] to add T , so sink maps in add T give sink maps in add(T ⊕ T [−n]). We
consider the sink map at Ta[−n]. Applying 2.1 for m = n there exists a commutative diagram of triangles

/ Aa ⊕

Tb[−n]

/ Ta[−n]

/ Ua[n + 1] ,

in which the middle map is the sink map in add(T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−n]). Since it has terms in add(T ⊕ T [−n]) it is
the one in add(T ⊕ T [−n]). Applying T (T ⊕ T [−n], −) gives an exact sequence

ab→a

T (T ⊕ T [−n], Ua[n])

/ T (T ⊕ T [−n], Aa ⊕

b→a Tb[−n])

/ T (T ⊕ T [−n], Ta[−n]) ,

in which we want to show that the ﬁrst map is 0. It is clear for the summand T (T [−n], −) since the above
sequence reduces to

`

T (T [−n], Ua[n])

/ T (T [−n],

b→a Tb[−n])

/ T (T [−n], Ta[−n]) ,

and the second map, being the sink map in add T [−n], is a monomorphism. Also we see that T (T, Ua[n]) →
T (T, Aa) is 0 by the sequence

`

T (T, Ua[n])

/ T (T, Aa)

/ T (T, Sa[−n]) ,

in which the second map is injective (in fact an isomorphism) by 2.10. It remains to show that the map

is 0. If n > 1 then T (T, Ua[n]) = 0 and we have the assertion. Now assume n = 1. We prove the following
statements by induction on the vertices of Q, which will complete the proof by (i).

`

T (T, Ua[n])

/ T (T,

b→a Tb[−n])

(i) The map T (T, Ua[1]) → T (T,
b→a Tb[−1]) is 0.
(ii) The EndT (T )-module T (T, Ta[−1]) is projective.

`

b→a Tb = 0 thus (i), and Ta = Sa thus (ii) by 2.10. Suppose now that
If a is a source, then we have
a is a general vertex of Q. By 2.5, the EndT (T )-module T (T, Ua[1]) has no projective summands while
T (T,
b→a Tb[−1]) is projective by induction hypothesis. Therefore the map in (i) has to be 0. Then by the
leftmost commutative square in (2.1), we have that T (T, Sa[−2]) → T (T,
b→a Tb[−1]) is 0, hence applying
T (T, −) to the second row gives a short exact sequence below by 2.7.

`

`

0

/ T (T,

b→a Tb[−1])

/ T (T, Ta[−1])

`
/ T (T, Sa[−1])

/ 0

This has projective end terms by induction hypothesis and 2.10 respectively, so we conclude that the middle
(cid:3)
term T (T, Ta[−1]) is also projective.

`

We conclude our discussion by explicitly describing the quiver

Q of EndT (T ⊕ T [−n]). Suppose that
EndT (T ) = kQ for an acyclic quiver Q. Note ﬁrst that T and T [−n] have no common direct summand by
T (T [−n], T ) = 0, thus
Q have two copies of Q as a subquiver. We need to investigate the arrows from the

Proposition 2.13. The following are equal.

(a) The number of arrows from Tb to Ta[−n].
(b) The number of direct summands Tb in Aa.
(c) The number of arrows from Ta to Tb[−n].
(d) The number of direct summands Ta in Ab.

e

Proof. By 2.1 the map Aa ⊕
similarly (c)=(d). Dually, 2.3 shows that the map Ta[n] → Aa ⊕
which shows (c)=(b).

b→a Tb[−n] → Ta[−n] is the sink map in add(T ⊕T [−n]). This gives (a)=(b), and
a→b Tb[n] is the source map in add(T ⊕T [n]),

Example 2.14. Let Q be the quiver of linearly oriented type A3 and T = C3(kQ) the 3-cluster category
of Q. We have its AR quiver as below, with a fundamental domain inside the dotted line. It has a 3-cluster
tilting object T = T1 ⊕ T2 ⊕ T3 which is obtained by mutating the initial cluster tilting object kQ ∈ C3(kQ)
at the sink.

We end this subsection with the following non-example, which shows that 2.12 fails for 4-CY case, that is,
even if T ∈ T is a 4-cluster tilting such that EndT (T ) is hereditary, the shifted sum T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ T [−2] does
not necessarily have hereditary endomorphism ring.
Example 2.15. Let Q be a quiver of type A3, and T = C4(kQ) the 4-cluster category of Q. Consider the

2.4. Even CY triangulated category with a cluster tilting object. As we have just seen in 2.15 above,
hereditaryness of T does not imply that of T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)] when d ≥ 4. Nevertheless we prove in
this section that in dimension 4, the endomorphism algebra of T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ T [−2] is hereditary as soon as that
of T ⊕ T [−1] is (2.21). As before, we work in a higher dimensional setting with vanishing of some negative
extensions.

Let n ≥ 1, and let T be a (2n + 2)-CY triangulated category with a (2n + 2)-cluster tilting object T
such that T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n, and EndT (T ⊕ T [−n]) is hereditary.
In this case EndT (T ) is
also hereditary, whose quiver we denote by Q. We denote by Ta the indecomposable direct summand of T
corresponding to the vertex a of Q. As in the previous subsection, our starting point is a computation of AR
sequences. Recall the deﬁnition of Sa and Ua from Section 2.2.

Proposition 2.16. The AR (2n + 4)-angle at Ta is of the form below for some Aa, Ba ∈ add T and Ya ∈ T .

Moreover the middle map f is 0.

Proof. We draw the AR sequence from the right. Clearly we have the rightmost triangle. By 2.7 we get the
triangles on the right half up to Sa[−n]. Dually we can draw the left triangles to obtain the AR (2n + 2)-angle
above. Now, since EndT (T ⊕ T [−n]) is hereditary we can apply 2.2(2) for m = n + 1, which shows f = 0. (cid:3)

As before we will refer to these AR (2n + 4)-angles as (AR). Similarly to the previous subsection, the

symmetry of (AR) gives the following.

Lemma 2.17. We have T (T, Ta[−j]) = 0 for n + 1 < j < 2n.

Proof. Put j = n + i so that 1 < i < n. By the triangle (a) in (AR) we have an exact sequence

0 = T (T, Aa[−i])

/ T (T, Sa[−j])

/ T (T, Ya[−i + 1])

/ T (T, Aa[−i + 1]) = 0 ,

in which the two end terms are 0 by vanishing of small negative self-extensions of T . Also by the triangle (b)
in (AR) we have

0 = T (T, Ba[−i + 1])

/ T (T, Ya[−i + 1])

/ T (T, Ua[n + 2 − i]) = 0 ,

where the leftmost term is 0 by vanishing of small negative self-extensions of T , and so is the rightmost term by
the leftmost triangle in (AR). We deduce by these exact sequences that T (T, Sa[−j]) = T (T, Ya[−i + 1]) = 0.

Now by the exact sequence

T (T,

b→a Tb[−j])

/ T (T, Ta[−j])

/ T (T, Sa[−j]) ,

we see inductively that T (T, Ta[−j]) = 0.

`

We need some more technical observations.

Lemma 2.18. We have T (T, Ya[−n + 1]) =

T (T, Ba)
0

(

(n = 1)
(n > 1)

.

Proof. This is easily shown by applying T (T, −) to the triangle (b) in (AR).

Lemma 2.19. The triangle (a) in (AR) yields a short exact sequence

0

/ T (T, Aa[−n])

/ T (T, Sa[−2n])

/ T (T, Ya[−n + 1])

/ 0 .

Consequently the EndT (T )-module T (T, Sa[−2n]) is projective.

We ﬁrst show right exactness. By 2.18 we only have to consider n = 1. Then g′ is an isomorphism by 2.10,

which gives the result.

We next show that the map g is 0, which yields left exactness. Applying T (T, −) to the middle map
g
−→ T (T, Aa[−n]). Now,

0 = f : Ba → Ya → Aa in (AR), we have a zero map T (T, Ba[−n]) h−→ T (T, Ya[−n])
applying T (T, −) to the triangle (b) in (AR) gives an exact sequence

T (T, Ba[−n])

/ T (T, Ya[−n])

/ T (T, Ua[1])

k

/ T (T, Ba[−n + 1])

′

k

/ T (T, Ya[−n + 1]) ,

in which we have k = 0. Indeed, if n > 1 then T (T, Ba[−n + 1]) = 0, and if n = 1 then k′ is an isomorphism
by 2.18. It follows that T (T, Ua[1]) = Coker h, so g factors through T (T, Ua[1]). But as T (T, Ua[1]) has no
non-zero projective summand by 2.5 while T (T, Aa[−n]) is projective since EndT (T ⊕ T [−n]) is hereditary,
this shows g = 0 as desired.

Finally, the EndT (T )-module T (T, Ya[−n+1]) is projective by 2.18 and so is T (T, Aa[−n]) since EndT (T ⊕
(cid:3)

T [−n]) is hereditary, thus the remaining assertion follows.

As a ﬁnal preparation we need an observation on the behavior of sink maps.

Lemma 2.20. Let n + 1 ≤ j ≤ 2n. Then the sink map at Ta[−j] in add(T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n]) is obtained from
the one at T [−n − 1] by shifting by [−(j − n − 1)].

Proof. Applying 2.3 for m = n + 1, the middle map in the triangle

Ua[n]

/ Ba ⊕ Aa[−1] ⊕

Tb[−n − 1]

/ Ta[−n − 1]

/ Ua[n + 1]

ab→a

gives the sink map at Ta[−n − 1] in add(T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−n − 1]). In view of rigidity of T , this is also the sink
map in add(T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n]). We have to show that in the shifted triangle

Ua[2n + 1 − j]

/ Ba[−(j − n − 1)] ⊕ Aa[−(j − n)] ⊕

Tb[−j]

v

/ Ta[−j]

/ Ua[2n + 2 − j] ,

the middle map is the sink map in add(T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n]). Since T is rigid and T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for i ∈
{0, . . . , 2n} \ {0, n, n + 1, 2n} by 2.17, this assertion is clear for j < 2n. It remains to verify j = 2n. It is
(cid:3)
enough to show T (T, v) is surjective, but this is clear by T (T, Ua[2]) = 0.

ab→a

Now we are ready to prove the 4-CY version, or more generally even CY version, of our main result of this

section.
Theorem 2.21. Let n ≥ 1 and let T be a (2n + 2)-CY triangulated category with a (2n + 2)-cluster tilting
object T . Suppose that T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n, and EndT (T ⊕ T [−n]) is hereditary. Then H =
EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n]) is hereditary.

Proof. We show that for each a ∈ Q0 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 2n the sink map at Ta[−j] in add(T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n]) is a
monomorphism.

By our assumptions this is clear for 0 ≤ j ≤ n.
Let n + 1 ≤ j < 2n, in particular n > 1. By 2.1 and 2.20, the map v in the triangle

Ua[n]

u

/ Ba ⊕ Aa[−1] ⊕

Tb[−n − 1]

v

/ Ta[−n − 1]

/ Ua[n + 1]

ab→a

gives the sink map at Ta[−n − 1] in add(T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n]), and the same holds for the sequence shifted
by [−(j − n − 1)]. We want to show T (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n], v[−(j − n − 1)]) is injective, or equivalently
T (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n], u[−(j − n − 1)]) = 0. By vanishing of some negative and positive self-extension of T , it

is enough to consider j = n + 1, thus is reduced to showing T (T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ T [−n − 1], u) = 0. This follows
from T (T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ T [−n − 1], Ua[n]) = 0, where we used n > 1 for T (T, Ua[n]) = 0.

Finally consider j = 2n. By 2.1 and 2.20 we have the commutative diagram

in which we want to show T (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n], v) is injective. Since T (T [−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n], Ua[1]) = 0 by
the leftmost triangle in (AR), it remains to prove that T (T, u) = 0. We prove by induction on the vertices of
Q the following statements, which will complete the proof.

(i) The map T (T, Ua[1]) → T (T, Ba[−n + 1] ⊕ Aa[−n] ⊕
(ii) The EndT (T )-module T (T, Ta[−2n]) is projective.

b→a Tb[−2n]) is 0.

`

If a is a source, then T (T, Ba[−n + 1] ⊕ Aa[−n]) is projective while T (T, Ua[1]) has no non-zero projective
summand by 2.5, so we have (i). Also in this case we have Ta = Sa, so (ii) by 2.19. Now suppose that a is
a general vertex of Q. Then the EndT (T )-module T (T, Ba[−n + 1] ⊕ Aa[−n] ⊕
b→a Tb[−2n]) is projective
by induction hypothesis, and T (T, Ua[1]) does not have a non-zero projective summand by 2.5, which gives
(i). Then the leftmost commutative square in (2.2) shows that the map T (T, Ya[−n]) → T (T, Aa[−n] ⊕

`

b→a Tb[−2n]) is 0, hence we obtain an exact sequence

`

0

/ T (T, Aa[−n] ⊕

b→a Tb[−2n])

/ T (T, Ta[−2n])

/ T (T, Ya[−n + 1]) .

Since the rightmost term is projective by 2.18, and so is the leftmost term by induction hypothesis, we deduce
(cid:3)
that the middle term is also projective, which completes the induction step, hence gives our result.

`

Finally let us describe the quiver of our hereditary algebra H = EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n]). As in 2.13 we can
compute the quiver
Q has (2n + 1)
Q of H from the AR (2n + 4)-angles. Since T is (2n + 2)-rigid the quiver
copies of Q as a subquiver. We investigate the arrows from Ta[−i] to Tb[−j]. By 2.17 we know that there is
an arrow Ta[−i] → Tb[−j] in Q only if j − i ∈ {0, n, n + 1, 2n}.
Proposition 2.22.

(1) Let 0 ≤ i ≤ n and 0 ≤ i′ ≤ n − 1. The following are equal.

e

e

(a) The number of arrows from Ta[−i] to Tb[−i − n].
(b) The number of summands Ta in Ab.
(c) The number of summands Tb in Ba.
(d) The number of arrows from Tb[−i′] to Ta[−i′ − n − 1].

(2) There is an arrow Ta to Tb[−2n] only if n = 1, in which case the number of arrows is given in (d)

above.

Proof. (1) By 2.1 the values of (a) are equal for i = 0 and i = 1, and in view of 2.20 they are equal to the ones
for all the other i. Therefore it is enough to consider the case i = 0. Similarly by 2.20 it suﬃces to assume
i′ = 0. Applying 2.1 to Tb and m = n gives (a)=(b), and 2.3 to Ta and m = n gives (a)=(c). Also, applying
2.1 to Ta and m = n + 1 gives (d)=(c).
(2) This follows from 2.20.

(cid:3)

We give several examples of the quiver of H for the case EndT (T ) = k.

Example 2.23. Suppose that EndT (T ) = k and put m = dimk T (T, T [−n]). Then the AR (2n + 4)-angle is

3. Realizing triangulated categories as cluster categories

Recall that the cluster category of a homologically smooth dg algebra Π is the Verdier quotient

C (Π) := per Π/D b(Π)

of the perfect derived category by the derived category of dg modules of ﬁnite dimensional total cohomology.
We think about how a triangulated category can be realized as a cluster category in the above sense, which
plays an important role in the proof of main results in this paper.

Let us note a preliminary result on cluster categories of a special class of dg algebras, namely (derived)
tensor algebras. This gives a description the cluster category in terms of the triangulated hull of a derived
category. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra of ﬁnite global dimension, and X a two-sided tilting complex
A X : D b(mod A) → D b(mod A) gives an
over A, thus X is a complex of (A, A)-bimodules such that F = − ⊗L
autoequivalence. We impose the following two conditions on X.

• For each L, M ∈ D b(mod A) we have HomD(A)(L, F iM ) = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many i ∈ Z.
• X is concentrated in (cohomological) degree ≤ 0.

Replacing X by a projective resolution over Ae, we put Π = TAX, the tensor algebra of X over A.

Proposition 3.1 ([Ke2, Section 7], [Am2, 4.13], see also [Han2, Section 8]). The dg algebra Π is homologically
smooth, and its cluster category C (Π) is equivalent to the canonical triangulated hull of D b(mod A)/ − ⊗L
AX.
Now we turn to the main subject of this section. Let T be a k-linear, Hom-ﬁnite triangulated category
with an generator X, that is, thick X = T . Assuming that T is algebraic and taking a derived endomorphism
algebra Γ of X, we have T = per Γ, and we consider the following condition on the dg algebra Γ.

(a) Each cohomology of Γ is ﬁnite dimensional.
(b) For each Y ∈ per Γ, H iY = 0 for i ≪ 0 implies Y = 0.
(c) The truncation Π := Γ≤0 is homologically smooth.
The following example is our principle one for the condition (b).

Lemma 3.2. If eΓ ∈ per Γ is d-cluster tilting for some idempotent e ∈ Γ and d ≥ 1, then (b) above hold.

Proof. Suppose eΓ ∈ per Γ is d-cluster tilting and HomD(Γ)(Γ, Y [≪ 0]) = 0. Then some d-successive extensions
from eΓ to Y vanish, so there exists l ∈ Z such that Homper Γ(eΓ, Y [l][i]) = 0 for 0 ≤ i < d. The vanishing
for 0 < i < d shows Y [l] ∈ add eΓ since eΓ ∈ per Γ is d-cluster tilting, and the vanishing for i = 0 shows
(cid:3)
Y [l] = 0.

We prove that our triangulated category T = per Γ arises as the cluster category; in fact it is the cluster

category of Π which is very simply described as above.

Theorem 3.3. Let Γ be a dg algebra satisfying the above (a), (b), and (c). Then the functor − ⊗L

Π Γ induces

We will temporarily have to work in big triangulated categories. Let D be a triangulated category with

arbitrary (set-indexed) coproducts. Recall that the homotopy colimit of a sequence

in D is an object M which ﬁts into a triangle

(non-unique) isomorphism, which is denoted by hocolimi≥0 Mi.

(cid:16)
−−−−→ Mi ⊕ Mi+1 ֒→

−fi (cid:17)

`

We will use some easy computations on homotopy colimits. For a complex M = (· · · → M i−1 → M i →
M i+1 → · · · ) and p ∈ Z, we denote by M ≤p the truncated complex, that is, the complex (· · · → M p−1 →
Z pM → 0 → · · · ). We then have an ascending sequence M ≤0 → M ≤1 → M ≤2 → · · · .

Lemma 3.4. Let Λ be an arbitrary negative dg algebra.

(1) We have M = hocolimp≥0 M ≤p for all M ∈ D(Λ).
(2) For each L ∈ per Λ and a sequence M0 → M1 → · · · in D(Λ), there exists a natural isomorphism

colim
p≥0

HomD(Λ)(L, Mp)

≃
−→ HomD(Λ)(L, hocolimp≥0 M ).

(3) For each L ∈ per Λ, M ∈ D(Λ), and N ∈ D(Λe), there is a natural isomorphism

colim
p≥0

HomD(Λ)(L, M ⊗L

Λ N ≤p)

≃
−→ HomD(Λ)(L, M ⊗L

Λ N ).

Proof. (1) is easy and (2) is well-known [N]. Then (3) follows since M ⊗L

Λ N = hocolimp≥0(M ⊗L

Λ N ≤p). (cid:3)

The following observation is crucial.

Lemma 3.5. We have L ⊗L

Π Γ = 0 for any L ∈ D b(Π).

Proof. Consider the triangle

Π

/ Γ

/ W

/ Π[1]

in D(Πe) obtained from the inclusion Π → Γ. Since Π is homologically smooth we have L ∈ per Π, hence
M := L ⊗L
Π Γ ∈ per Γ. We show that M is bounded below, and the claim follows from our assumption (b).
Π W → L[1], in which L ∈ D b(Π) is
Applying L ⊗L
bounded below, and L ⊗L
Π W ∈ thickD(Π) W is also bounded below. Therefore the middle term M is bounded
(cid:3)
below.

Π − to the above triangle yields a triangle L → M → L ⊗L

Now we are ready to prove our general structure theorem.

Proof of 3.3. First note that 3.5 gives rise to a functor we want: The tensor product − ⊗L
functor C (Π) → per Γ. We have to show that the map HomC (Π)(L, M ) → HomD(Γ)(L⊗L
for each L, M ∈ per Π. Note that the right-hand-side is isomorphic to HomD(Π)(L, M ⊗L
then the map in question is induced by applying HomD(Π)(L, −) to the natural map M = M ⊗L
that is, we have a commutative diagram

Let us note some complementary observations which we use later. Recall that a morphism A → B of
dg algebras is a localization (or a homological epimorphism) if the restriction functor D(B) → D(A) is fully
faithful. This is equivalent to saying that a natural map B ⊗L

A B → B is a quasi-isomorphism.

Proposition 3.6. In the situation of 3.3, we have the following.

(1) The map Π → Γ is a localization.
(2) Under the identiﬁcation D(Γ) ⊂ D(Π), we have D(Γ) = {X ∈ D(Π) | RHomΠ(X, Π) = 0}.

Proof. (1) We prove that the multiplication map Γ ⊗L
triangle Π → Γ → W → Π[1] obtained from Π → Γ, we have a triangle

Π Γ → Γ is an isomorphism. Applying − ⊗L

Π Γ to the

Since W is a homotopy colimit of the ﬁnite dimensional Π-modules W ≤p by 3.4(1), we have W ⊗L
Π Γ = 0 by
3.5, thus the ﬁrst map is an isomorphism. Being its left inverse, the multiplication map is also an isomorphism.
(2) The inclusion ⊂ is equivalent to saying RHomΠ(Γ, Π) = 0. Note that this is the dual of Γ ⊗L
Π DΠ,
Π (DΠ)≤p by 3.4(3), thus is 0 by 3.5. Next we show the converse inclusion. Let
which equals hocolimp≥0 Γ ⊗L
X ∈ D(Π) such that RHomΠ(X, Π) = 0. Applying X ⊗L
Π − to Π → Γ → W → Π[1], we have a triangle
X → X ⊗L
Π W = 0, which is equivalent to the
vanishing of its dual RHomΠ(X, DW ). Since RHomΠ(X, Π) = 0 and Π is smooth, we have RHomΠ(X, L) = 0
for all L ∈ D b(Π), and consequently RHomΠ(X, L) = 0 for all L ∈ D(Π) which can be written as a homotopy
limit of objects in D b(Π). On the other hand, W = hocolimp≥0 W ≤p by 3.4(1), so DW is a homotopy limit of
(cid:3)
ﬁnite dimensional Π-modules. It follows that RHomΠ(X, DW ) = 0, as desired.

Π W → X[1] in D(Π). Therefore we have to show X ⊗L

Π Γ → X ⊗L

We apply the result from previous section to prove our main result 1.2 of this paper which is an explicit

structure theorem for CY categories with cluster tilting objects. It will be proved in 4.13 in this section.

NORIHIRO HANIHARA

Let us give a sketch of the proof. Let T be an algebraic d-CY triangulated category with d ≥ 2. Suppose

that there exists a d-cluster tilting object T ∈ T . Put

Since X has a d-cluster tilting object T as a direct summand, we can apply 3.3. For this we need to know its
truncated derived endomorphism algebra Π. It turns out that its cohomology which is given by

X = T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)].

S =

T (X, X[−i]),

is intrinsically formal (4.11, 4.12), that is, any dg algebra with cohomology S is formal, thus Π is nothing but
S regarded as a dg algebra with trivial diﬀerentials. We are therefore reduced to study the algebra S. For this
we consider the functor

F = T (X, −) : T

/ mod H

ai≥0

to the category of modules over H = EndT (X) and compare T with it. An important observation is that any
object in T has a 2-term resolution by objects from add X (4.1), by which we show that this functor is close
enough to being an equivalence; in fact it is full (4.4) and induces an equivalence between stable categories
(4.5). Using this functor F , we prove in 4.9 that there is an isomorphism

S = THT (X, X[−1])
of graded algebras, where the right-hand-side is the tensor algebra of an (H, H)-bimodule T (X, X[−1]). In
view of 3.1, this description of S as a tensor algebra allows us to write the cluster category C (Π) as an orbit
category of D b(mod H).

4.1. The structure theorem. The ﬁrst and an important step toward 4.13 is the observation that any
objects in T has a 2-term resolution by X = T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]. For subcategories U , V ⊂ T , we denote
by U ∗ V the full subcategory of T formed by A ∈ T such that there exists a triangle U → A → V → U [1]
with U ∈ U and V ∈ V . This operation ∗ is associative by the octahedral axiom. For objects U, V ∈ T ,
we will simply write U ∗ V for add U ∗ add V . Also we denote by U ∨ V the smallest additive subcategory
containing U and V , and similarly U ∨ V for add U ∨ add V .
Proposition 4.1. Let T be a triangulated category and T ∈ T a d-rigid object. Put

X = T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 3)] ⊕ T [−(d − 2)],

Y = T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 3)],

and suppose that EndT (Y ) is hereditary. Then we have

In particular, if T ∈ T is d-cluster tilting, then T = X ∗ X[1].

T [−(d − 2)] ∗ · · · ∗ T ∗ T [1] = X ∗ X[1].

Proof. The inclusion ⊃ is easy. Indeed, we have X ∗ X[1] ⊂ (T [−(d − 2)] ∗ · · · ∗ T ) ∗ (T [−(d − 3)] ∗ · · · ∗ T [1]),
which equals T [−(d − 2)] ∗ · · · ∗ T [1] by d-rigidity of T . We prove the converse inclusion by induction on d.
The case d = 2 is clear (where we understand Y = 0 for d = 2), so let d ≥ 3.

Let A ∈ T [−(d − 2)] ∗ · · · ∗ T ∗ T [1]. Then there is a triangle

T0

/ B

/ A

/ T0[1]

in T with T0 ∈ add T and B ∈ T [−(d − 2)] ∗ · · · ∗ T . By induction hypothesis applied to a (d − 1)-rigid object
T [−1], we see that B ∈ Y [−1] ∗ Y , and the same is true for any direct summand of B since T [−(d − 2)] ∗ · · · ∗ T
is closed under direct summands ([IYo, 2.1]).

Now write B = B′ ⊕ T1 with T1 ∈ add T and add B′ ∩ add T = 0. We know that B′ ∈ Y [−1] ∗ Y . We claim

that there exists a triangle

Y0[−1]

/ B′

/ Y1

/ Y0

with Y0, Y1 ∈ add Y which induces a surjection T (Y, Y0[−1]) ։ T (Y, B′). Since we can discuss summandwise,
it is enough to consider each indecomposable direct summand B0 of B′.
If B0 ∈ add Y , then we have
B0 ∈ add Y [−1] since B0 6∈ add T , so we can take Y0[−1] = B0 and Y1 = 0, which gives a desired triangle.
If B0 6∈ add Y , we show that any triangle as above has the desired surjectivity. Indeed, since EndT (Y ) is

/

MORITA THEOREM FOR HEREDITARY CALABI-YAU CATEGORIES

hereditary, the morphism Y1 → Y0, which becomes under the equivalence T (Y, −) : add Y → proj EndT (Y )
the morphism between projective EndT (Y )-modules, is isomorphic to the direct sum of Y ′
1 → Y0 inducing an
injection T (Y, Y ′
1 has to be 0 since B0 is an
indecomposable 6∈ add Y . It follows that T (Y, Y1) → T (Y, Y0) is injective, hence T (Y, Y0[−1]) → T (Y, B0)
is surjective, which ﬁnishes the proof of the claim.

1 ) ֒→ T (Y, Y0), and Y ′′

1 → 0. This forces Y ′′

1 ∈ add B0, so Y ′′

By the triangle T0 → B → A → T0[1] with B = B′ ⊕ T1, we can form an octahedral on the left below.

On the other hand, taking a triangle for B′ in the claim above, the morphism T0 → B′ can be lifted to
T0 → Y0[−1] since T0 ∈ add Y . This gives another octahedral as in the right diagram above.

We can now reach the conclusion using these diagrams. Looking at the second octahedral, we have C ∈
Y [−1] ∗ T [1] by the left vertical triangle, so using the lower horizontal one, we see A′ ∈ Y [−1] ∗ T [1] ∗ Y , which
equals Y [−1] ∗ X[1] by T [1] ∗ Y = T [1] ∨ Y = add X[1]. Now we move to the left octahedral. By the right
(cid:3)
vertical triangle, we see A ∈ T ∗ Y [−1] ∗ X[1], which is X ∗ X[1] by T ∗ Y [−1] = T ∨ Y [−1] = add X.

Now we place ourselves in the setup as in 4.13: T is a d-CY triangulated category and T ∈ T is d-cluster
tilting. Put X = T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)] and H = EndT (X), which we assume to be hereditary. For the moment
we do not need that H is 1-representation inﬁnite. Let us note a complementary observation on the 2-term
resolution, although it will not be used later in this paper.

Remark 4.2. Let A ∈ T and let X0 → A be any right (add X)-approximation. Then its mapping cocone is in
add X.

Proof. We may assume that the approximation is minimal and A is indecomposable. If A ∈ add T [1], then
the minimal right (add X)-approximation is 0 → A, thus its mapping cocone is A[−1] ∈ add X. If A ∈ add X,
then the minimal approximation is the identity, thus its mapping cocone is 0. Finally suppose that A 6∈
f
−→ A → X1[1] in 4.1, the map f is a right
add(X ⊕ T [1]). Then by 4.7(1) below, in any triangle X1 → X0
(add X)-approximation. In particular, there exists a right (add X)-approximation of A whose mapping cocone
(cid:3)
is in add X. It follows that the minimal right (add X)-approximation has the same property.

Now we consider the functor

F = T (X, −) : T

/ mod H .

Let us give some easy observations which we will often use.

Lemma 4.3.

(1) F X and F X[1] are projective H-modules.

(2) F X[d] and F X[d − 1] are injective H-modules.
(3) For A ∈ T , we have F A = 0 if and only if A ∈ add T [1].
(4) We have a commutative diagram of equivalences

NORIHIRO HANIHARA

Proof. We have F X = H ∈ proj H. Also all the direct summands of X[1] except T [1] are in add X, and
F T [1] = 0 since T is d-rigid, so F X[1] ∈ proj H. This proves (1). Using Serre duality we similarly have (2).
(cid:3)
We see (3) since T ∈ T is d-cluster tilting. Finally (4) is clear.

We next discuss more essential properties of the functor F .
Lemma 4.4. The functor F = T (X, −) : T → mod H is full.
Proof. We have to show that for each A, B ∈ T , the functor F induces surjections FA,B : T (A, B) →
HomH (F A, F B). First FA,B is clearly bijective if A ∈ add X. Note also that it is surjective if A ∈ add X[1].
Indeed, all the direct summands of X[1] except T [1] lies in add X, so we may assume A = T [1]. But we have
F T [1] = 0 by 4.3(3), hence FT [1],B is surjective.

Now we prove FA,B is surjective for all A ∈ T . By 4.1, we have a triangle

X1

/ X0

/ A

/ X1[1]

with X0, X1 ∈ add X. Applying T (−, B) yields the exact sequence in the ﬁrst row of the diagram below. On
the other hand, applying F = T (X, −) gives an exact sequence F X1 → F X0 → F A u−→ F X1[1] v−→ F X0[1] in
mod H. Now since F X0[1] is projective by 4.3(1) the morphism v is a split epimorphism to its image, hence
applying HomH (−, F B) yields a complex in the second row, which is acyclic at the middle term.

T (X0[1], B)

/ H (F X1, F B)

Now the right two vertical maps are isomorphisms and the left two are surjective by the starting remark. It
(cid:3)
easily follows that the middle map is surjective.

Moreover this functor gives equivalences when passing to ideal quotients.

Proposition 4.5.

(1) The functor F = T (X, −) : T → mod H induces stable equivalences

F : T /[X ⊕ T [1]]

≃

/ mod H and F : T /[T [1] ⊕ X[d]]

≃

/ mod H.

(2) We have an isomorphism of functors F ◦ [d − 1] ≃ τ ◦ F : T → mod H. Consequently there exists a

commutative diagram of equivalences

T /[X ⊕ T [1]]

/ mod H

[d−1]

We ﬁrst prove (1).

Proof of 4.5(1). Since F X = H, F T [1] = 0, and F X[d] = DH (see 4.3), the functor F induces the functors
F and F on stable categories.

We only prove that F is an equivalence. The statement for F is proved dually. We immediately see that
this is full by 4.4. We show that this is faithful. Let f : A → B be a morphism in T such that F f in mod H
factors through a projective H-module. Taking a right (add X)-approximation X ′ → B, the morphism F f
factors through a surjection F X ′ ։ F B as in the left diagram below.

Since F is full, the lift F A → F X ′ comes from a morphism A → X ′ in T . Now take a triangle X1 →

B becomes commutative under F = T (X, −), the maps f : A → B and A → X ′ → B coincide when
precomposing X0 → A. Therefore the diﬀerence of these two maps factors through X1[1], and f , being the
sum of A → X ′ → B and A → X1[1] → B, factors through an object in add(X ⊕ X[1]) = add(X ⊕ T [1]). This
proves faithfulness.

Finally we show that F is dense. Let M ∈ mod H and consider the projective resolution 0 → P1 → P0 →
M → 0. Let X1 → X0 be a morphism in add X ⊂ T corresponding to P1 → P0 under the equivalence
proj H ≃ add X, and complete it to a triangle X1 → X0 → A → F X1[1]. Applying F we have an exact
sequence below, with M (resp. P ) the cokernel of F X1 → F X0 (resp. F X0 → F A).

Note that P is a submodule a projective H-module F X1[1] (4.3(1)), hence is projective. Then the short exact
(cid:3)
sequence 0 → M → F A → P → 0 splits, thus F A ≃ M in mod H.

This yields a certain desirable behavior of objects under F .

Lemma 4.6. Let A ∈ T be an indecomposable object.

(1) If A 6≃ T [1] then F A is indecomposable.
(2) F A ∈ mod H is projective if and only if A ∈ add(X ⊕ T [1]).
(3) F A ∈ mod H is injective if and only if A ∈ add(T [1] ⊕ X[d]).

Proof. Immediate by 4.5(1).

Lemma 4.7. Let A ∈ T be an indecomposable object and let

Proof. We only prove (1). We have an exact sequence

F A[−1]

/ F A v

/ F X1[1] .

Since H is hereditary, each of the morphisms u and v is a split epimorphism to its image by 4.3(1).

We ﬁrst show that u is injective. Note that f is right minimal. Indeed, if f is not right minimal, then X1
and A[−1] share a direct summand, which is impossible by our assumption A[−1] 6∈ add X. It follows that
u = F f is also right minimal, hence injective.

We next show that v = 0. Since A 6∈ add(X ⊕ T [1]), we see F A is indecomposable non-projective H-module
(cid:3)

by 4.6(1)(2), thus v has to be 0.

Now we can prove the second part of 4.5.

Proof of 4.5(2). Let A, B ∈ T without a direct summand in add(X ⊕ T [1]), and let f : A → B be a morphism
in T . We compute the AR translation of F f : F A → F B in mod H. Let X1 → X0 → A → X1[1] and

From now on we assume that H is 1-representation inﬁnite. The reason we (have to) assume this is the

following nice behavior of objects under suspension of T , which allows us to use 4.7 quite freely.
Lemma 4.8. The objects {T [−l] | l ∈ Z} do not mutually share a direct summand, that is, add T [−i] ∩
add T [−j] = 0 whenever i 6= j. In particular, T [−l] does not share a direct summand with X ⊕ T [1] whenever
l ≥ d − 1.

Proof. By 4.5(2), the functor F takes T [≤ 0] to preprojective H-modules, T [1] to 0, and T [≥ 2] to preinjective
H-modules. Therefore the H-modules F T [−l] mutually do not share a summand for all l ∈ Z since H is
(cid:3)
1-representation inﬁnite. Then the statements follow from 4.6.

Now consider the algebra

Also let U := T (X, X[−1]), which we view as a bimodule over H.

ai≥0

S =

T (X, X[−i]).

Proposition 4.9. We have an isomorphism THU ≃ S of graded algebras.
Proof. We have to show that U ⊗H U ⊗H · · · ⊗H U ≃ T (X, X[−l]) for all l ≥ 0. By induction it is enough to
show that the natural map

T (X[−1], X[−l]) ⊗H T (X, X[−1])

/ T (X, X[−l])

is an isomorphism for all l ≥ 1. One can check that its dual is isomorphic to the composite of the following
natural maps.

D(T (X[−1], X[−l]) ⊗H T (X, X[−1])) = HomH (T (X[−1], X[−l]), DT (X, X[−1]))
= HomH (T (X[−1], X[−l]), T (X[−1], X[d]))
= HomH (T (X, X[−l + 1]), T (X, X[d + 1]))

MORITA THEOREM FOR HEREDITARY CALABI-YAU CATEGORIES

for all l ≥ 0. By 4.4, we know that this is surjective. We claim that this is injective. When 0 ≤ l ≤ d − 2 then
T [−l] ∈ add X and the assertion is clear. We assume l ≥ d − 1, so that T [−l] do not share a direct summand
with X ⊕ T [1] by 4.8 and we can apply 4.7. Let f : T [−l] → X[d + 1] be a morphism which is 0 under F .
Taking a triangle X1 → X0 → T [−l] → X1[1] in 4.1, we see that f is mapped to 0 under the last map in the
exact sequence below.

T (X0, X[d])

/ T (T [−l], X[d + 1])

/ T (X0, X[d + 1])

Also the ﬁrst map a is dual to T (X, X1) → T (X, X0), which is injective by 4.7(1). We conclude that a is
(cid:3)
surjective, hence f = 0 as desired.

We next give the following property of the bimodule U , which shows that the bimodule U gives a (d − 1)-st

root of the AR translation.

Proposition 4.10. We have isomorphisms

H U ≃ U ⊗H · · · ⊗H U ≃ Ext1
in the derived category of (H, H)-bimodules, where the tensor factor is (d − 1)-times. Therefore the functor
− ⊗L

H U gives an autoequivalence on D b(mod H) whose (d − 1)-st power is the AR translation.

Proof. Since U is a preprojective H-module by 4.5(2) we have the ﬁrst isomorphism. We prove the second
one. By 4.9 we have to show T (X, X[−d + 1]) ≃ Ext1
It follows from the dual of 4.5(2) that
T (X, X[−d + 1]) ≃ τ −1H = Ext1
H (DH, H) in mod H. Naturality of this isomorphism shows that it is
(cid:3)
compatible with left H-actions, that is, T (X, X[−d + 1]) ≃ Ext1

Now assume that the algebra H/JH is separable over k, which is the case if H is the path algebra of an

acyclic quiver.

Lemma 4.11. The graded algebra S is homologically smooth of dimension ≤ 2, that is, proj. dimSe S ≤ 2.
Proof. Since H is 1-representation inﬁnite and U is a preprojective module such that − ⊗L
H U gives an autoe-
quivalence on D b(mod H), we see that the derived tensor algebra T L
HU := TH Ψ, where Ψ → U is a bimodule
projective resolution, has its cohomology concentrated in degree 0, where it is S. This shows that there is a

[Ke5, 4.8]. Now the ﬁrst term is concentrated in degree ≤ 0 by proj. dimHe H ≤ 1, and so is the second

Recall that a dg algebra is formal if it is isomorphic to its cohomology in the homotopy category of dg
categories. A graded algebra Λ is intrinsically formal if any dg algebra with cohomology Λ is formal. We
use the following criterion for intrinsic formality using Hochschild cohomology. We denote by [1] the degree
shift of graded vector spaces. For a graded bimodule M over Λ, the shifted bimodule M [1] has Λ-actions
a · x · b = (−1)deg aaxb.

Proposition 4.12 ([Ka], see also [ST, 4.7][RW, 1.7]). Let Λ be a graded k-algebra such that Exti
Λe (Λ, Λ[2−i]) =
0 for all i > 2. Then Λ is intrinsically formal. In particular if proj. dimΛe Λ ≤ 2 then Λ is intrinsically formal.

We are now ready to prove our main theorem of this paper which gives a Morita-type result for cluster

categories arising from hereditary algebras.

Theorem 4.13. Let T be an algebraic d-CY triangulated category with a d-cluster tilting object T . We put
X = T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]. Suppose that H = EndT (X) is 1-representation inﬁnite and H/JH is
separable over k. Set U = T (X, X[−1]), which we view as an (H, H)-bimodule.

(1) There exists an isomorphism U ⊗L
(2) There exists a triangle equivalence T ≃ D b(mod H)/ − ⊗L

H (d−1) ≃ Ext1

H (DH, H) of (H, H)-bimodules.
HU [1].

Therefore we can write T ≃ D b(mod H)/τ −1/(d−1)[1] for τ −1/(d−1) := − ⊗L

H U .

Proof. We have seen (1) in 4.10, so we prove (2). Let Γ be a derived endomorphism ring of X in some dg
enhancement of T and set Π = Γ≤0. By 4.9 we know the cohomology of Π is isomorphic to the tensor algebra
S = TH U . By 4.11 and 4.12, it is intrinsically formal, thus Π is quasi-isomorphic to S viewed as a dg algebra
with deg U = −1 and zero diﬀerential; Π = TH(U [1]). It follows from the ﬁrst triangle in the proof of 4.11
that Π is homologically smooth. Now, X has a d-cluster tilting object T as a direct summand so we can apply
3.3, and therefore there exists a triangle equivalence T = per Γ ≃ C (Π). By 3.1 the cluster category C (Π) is
(cid:3)
equivalent to D b(mod H)/ − ⊗L

H U [1].

4.2. Corollaries. Some of the (d−1)-st root τ 1/(d−1) stated 4.13 arises in a somewhat absurd way, for example,
H is a direct product of (d − 1) copies of an algebra H ′, and τ 1/(d−1) on D b(mod H) = D b(mod H ′) × · · · ×
D b(mod H ′) is given by (L1, . . . , Ld−1) 7→ (L2, . . . , Ld−1, τ ′L1) using the AR translation τ ′ for H ′. The proof
of corollaries consists of such an interpretation of τ 1/(d−1). Together with an observation in 5.2 below allows
us to rewrite the orbit category D b(mod H)/τ −1/(d−1)[1] in terms of D b(mod H ′) and τ ′−1.

Now we look at some consequences of our main theorem 4.13. When d = 2, this immediately reduces to
Keller–Reiten’s recognition theorem for non-Dynkin quivers. More generally, using an interpretation of the
(d − 1)-st root τ −1/(d−1) as above, we can recover its generalization to higher dimension.

[KR]). Let T be an algebraic d-CY triangulated category with a d-cluster tilting ob-
Corollary 4.14 (cf.
ject T . Suppose that H ′ = EndT (T ) is 1-representation inﬁnite, H ′/JH′
is separable over k, and that
HomT (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < d/2. Then there exists a triangle equivalence T ≃ D b(mod H ′)/τ −1[d − 1].

Proof. By 2.8 we have T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ d−2. Then we have the following forms of H = EndT (X)
and the bimodule U = T (X, X[−1]):

H = H ′ × · · · × H ′,

with V = T (T, T [−(d−1)]). Note that by the above descriptions we have U ⊗H (d−1) = V ×· · ·×V , hence using
4.10, we see V ≃ Ext1
H′ (DH ′, H ′) as (H ′, H ′)-bimodules. Now since H = H ′ × · · · × H ′ is 1-representation
inﬁnite and H/JH is separable over k, we can apply 4.13, so our triangulated category T is triangle equivalent
to D b(mod H)/ − ⊗L
H′ V [d − 1], and we deduce
(cid:3)
by V ≃ Ext1

HU [1]. By 5.2 this is triangle equivalent to D b(mod H ′)/ − ⊗L

H′ (DH ′, H ′) that this is precisely the d-cluster category of H ′.

The next case d = 3 generalizes a theorem of Keller–Murfet–Van den Bergh as well as giving a 3-CY version
of Keller–Reiten’s theorem above. Again with a suitable vanishing conditions and an interpretation of (d−1)-st
root, we have the following structure theorem for CY categories of dimension d = 2n + 1. In this case the
2n-th root τ 1/2n can generally be reduced to a square root.

Corollary 4.15. Let T be an algebraic (2n+1)-CY triangulated category with a (2n+1)-cluster tilting object T
such that EndT (T ) is hereditary, and T (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n. Then, the algebra H ′ = EndT (T ⊕T [−n])
is hereditary, and there exists a triangle equivalence T ≃ D b(mod H ′)/τ −1/2[n] if H ′ is 1-representation
inﬁnite and H ′/JH′ is separable over k.

Proof. Recall that X = T ⊕· · ·⊕T [−(2n−1)]) and put Y = T ⊕T [−n]. Then by 2.12 the algebra H ′ = EndT (Y )
is hereditary, and by 2.11 the algebra H = EndT (X) and the bimodule U = T (X, X[−1]) has the following

where the product has n factors, the matrix is n × n, and V = T (Y, Y [−n]). Now the above descriptions show
U ⊗H (2n) = V ⊗H′ 2 × · · · × V ⊗H′ 2, hence by 4.10 we deduce V ⊗H′ V ≃ Ext1
H′ (DH ′, H ′) as (H ′, H ′)-bimodules
H′ V can be regarded as a square root τ −1/2 of the AR translation on D b(mod H ′). When H ′ is
so that − ⊗L
1-representation inﬁnite and H ′/JH′ is separable over k, so is H, so we can apply 4.13 to obtain a triangle
(cid:3)
equivalence T ≃ D b(mod H)/ − ⊗L

HU [1]. By 5.2 this is equivalent to D b(mod H ′)/ − ⊗L

H′ V [n].

The ﬁnal case is d = 4. Yet again, we state this more generally for even dimensional CY categories.

Corollary 4.16. Let T be an algebraic (2n + 2)-CY triangulated category with a (2n + 2)-cluster tilting
object T such that HomT (T, T [−i]) = 0 for 0 < i < n and EndT (T ) = k × · · · × k. Then the algebra H =
EndT (T ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−2n]) is hereditary and there exists a triangle equivalence T ≃ D b(mod H)/τ −1/(2n+1)[1].

We remark that there is no analogue of interpreting the (d − 1)-st root in this situation; in general τ 1/(d−1)

cannot be made easier. This is because H is in general connected in this case, see 2.23.

4.3. Uniqueness of enhancements. We note that the proof of our main theorem 4.13 actually gives the
uniqueness of enhancements for such triangulated categories (4.18). Before that we give the following remark
on connectivity of our triangulated category. Although it may happen that H is not connected even if the
triangulated category T is connected, we show that every connected component of the (valued) quiver of H
as the same underlying graph as long as T is connected.
Proposition 4.17. Let T be a d-CY triangulated category with a d-cluster tilting object T such that EndT (T ⊕
T [−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]) = H is hereditary. Let Q be the valued quiver of H.

(1) There is a free action of the cyclic group G of order d − 1 on the underlying valued graph Q of Q.
(2) The triangulated category T is connected if and only if the orbit graph Q/G is connected.

Proof. (1) Without loss of generality we assume T is basic, and identify each of the indecomposable direct
summands of X = T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)] with the corresponding vertex of Q. Clearly Q has d − 1
copies of the quiver of EndT (T ) as a full subquiver. We consider the remaining arrows.
We draw the AR (d + 2)-angles in add T at each direct summand Ta of T as below.

Put Da = EndT (Ta), which is a division algebra. The valuation of the arrow Ta → Tb[−i] in Q is given
by the (Db, Da)-bimodule JX /J 2
X(Ta, Tb[−i]), where JX is the Jacobson radical of the category add X. Ap-
plying 2.1 to m = i, we see that this bimodule is isomorphic as a right Da-vector space to T /JT (Ta, T (i)
b ),
whose dimension is nothing but the number of summands Ta in T (i)
. Dually by 2.3, we have an isomor-
phism JX /J 2
, Tb) of left Db-vector spaces, whose dimension is the number
of summands Tb in T (d−1−i)
. We deduce that the valuation of the arrow Ta → Tb[−i] is equal to that of
a
Ta[−(d − 1 − i)] ← Tb for 1 ≤ i ≤ d − 2.
It easily follows that the map on the vertices of Q given by
Ta[−i] 7→ Ta[−(i + 1)] and Ta[−(d − 2)] 7→ Ta extends to an automorphism of Q.

X (Ta, Tb[−i]) ≃ T /JT (T (d−1−i)

(2) It is clear that Q/G is not connected when T is not connected. Suppose conversely that Q/G is not
connected. This amounts to saying that there exists a decomposition T = T1 ⊕ T2 such that T (X1, X2) = 0 =
T (X2, X1), where Xi = Ti ⊕ Ti[−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ Ti[−(d − 2)] for i = 1, 2. We claim T = thick T1 × thick T2.

Step 1: T (T1, T2[−(d − 1)]) = 0 = T (T2, T1[−(d − 1)]).
We prove the ﬁrst equality. Consider the AR (d + 2)-angle in add T at T2. Applying 2.1 to m = d − 2,
2 [−(d − 2 − i)] → T2[−(d − 2)] is the sink map in add(T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]).

is the source map in add T , so we also have T (d−1)

It follows from T (T1, X2) = 0 that T (i)
T2 → T (d−1)
2
obtain the sink map
no non-zero homomorphism from T1 to all the summands in the left-hand-side except T (T1, T (0)
so we have a surjection T (T1, T (0)
of the quiver of T2 that T (T1, T2[−(d − 1)]) = 0.

2 ∈ add T2 for 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 2. On the other hand, the leftmost map
∈ add T2. Then applying 2.1 to m = d − 1, we
2 [−(d−1−i)] → T2[−(d−1)] in add(T ⊕T [−1]⊕· · ·⊕T [−(d−1)]). Now there are
[−(d − 1)]),
[−(d − 1)]) → T (T1, T2[−(d − 1)]). It follows by induction on the vertices

Step 2: T (T1, T2[l]) = T (T2, T1[l]) = 0 for all l ∈ Z.
Since T1 ⊕ T2 ∈ T is d-cluster tilting, we have the assertion for 0 < l < d. By the d-CY property of T it is
enough to prove the claim for l ≤ 0. We show T (T1, T2[−i]) = 0 for i ≥ 0 by induction on i. By assumption
we know this for 0 ≤ i ≤ d − 2, and for i = d − 1 by the previous step. Now observe that T1 ⊕ T2[−1] is a
d-cluster tilting object with the same properties, that is, T (X1, X2[−1]) = 0 = T (X2[−1], X1). Indeed, this is
a d-cluster tilting object since it is the right mutation of T1 ⊕ T2 at T2 ([IYo, 5.1]). Also, the ﬁrst vanishing
amounts to saying T (T1, T2[i]) = 0 for −(d − 1) ≤ i ≤ d − 3, which follows from Step 1, and the second one to
T (T2, T1[i]) = 0 for −(d − 3) ≤ i ≤ d − 1, which is clear. Then applying Step 1 to the d-cluster tilting object
T1 ⊕ T2[−1] we deduce T (T1, T2[−d]) = 0. Similarly applying it to T1[−1] ⊕ T2 yields T (T2, T1[−d]) = 0. We
will inductively have the assertion.

2

Step 3: The conclusion.
By Step 2, we have T ⊃ thick T1 × thick T2.

It remains to prove that any indecomposable object lies
either in thick T1 or thick T2. Let A ∈ T be an indecomposable object.
If A ∈ add(X ⊕ T [1]) then the
assertion is clear. If A 6∈ add(X ⊕ T [1]), then by 4.7 there is a triangle X −1 → X 0 → A → X −1[1] in T with
X −1, X 0 ∈ add X such that 0 → T (X, X −1) → T (X, X 0) → T (X, A) → 0 is a minimal projective resolution
in mod H. Since H = EndT (X1) × EndT (X2), both X −1 and X 0 has to be in add Xi for the same i. We
(cid:3)
deduce that A ∈ Xi ∗ Xi[1] ⊂ thick Ti.

Recall that an enhancement of a triangulated category T is a dg category A together with a triangle
equivalence per A ≃ T . We say two enhancements A and B are equivalent if there is X ∈ D(A op ⊗ B) such
A X : per A → per B is an equivalence. A triangulated category has a unique enhancement if any of
that − ⊗L
its two enhancements are equivalent.

Theorem 4.18. Let k be a perfect ﬁeld, d ≥ 2 and T an algebraic d-CY triangulated category with a d-cluster
tilting object T such that H = EndT (T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]) is hereditary. Then T has a unique
enhancement.

Proof. We may assume that T is connected as a triangulated category. Then by 4.17 above, the hereditary
algebra H is either representation-ﬁnite or 1-representation inﬁnite. If H is representation-ﬁnite, then T has
ﬁnitely many indecomposable objects by 4.5. The uniqueness of enhancements for such triangulated categories
is established in [M]. Now assume that H is 1-representation inﬁnite. Let A be an enhancement of T , and
Γ = A (X, X) with X = T ⊕ T [−1] ⊕ · · · ⊕ T [−(d − 2)]. Clearly A and Γ are derived Morita equivalent. By
the proof of 4.13 the dg algebra Π = Γ≤0 is independent of the enhancement A (by the intrinsic formality
of its cohomology), so it is enough to prove that Π determines Γ up to derived Morita equivalence. But this
(cid:3)
follows from 3.6(2), as it says D(Γ) is categorically characterized in D(Π).

5. Adjusting orbits

We observe that certain interpretation of (d − 1)-st root of the AR translation as in Section 4.2 gives an
equivalence of orbit categories, leading to the proof of corollaries. The aim of this section is to prove such
equivalences in the level of dg enhancements. The content here is in this way a reﬁnement of [Han2, Appendix
A].

Let A be a dg category and let F : A → A be a dg functor. Then we can deﬁne the dg orbit category

A /F [Ke2]; it has the same objects as A and the morphism complex

Let us note the following consequence in which form we use.

Proposition 5.2. Let A be a pretriangulated dg category and F : A → A a dg functor inducing an equiv-
alence on H 0A . Let B = A × · · · × A the n-fold product and deﬁne G : B → B by (L1, . . . , Ln) 7→
(F Ln, L1, . . . , Ln−1). Then L 7→ (L, 0, . . . , 0) gives a quasi-equivalence A /F [n] → B/G[1].
Proof. Since (G[1])n = F [n] × · · · × F [n], we can apply 5.1 so that we have a fully faithful functor A /F [n] →
B/G[1].
It remains to show that the induced functor H 0(A /F [n]) → H 0(B/G[1]) is dense. This follows
from the fact that for each L ∈ A and 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the object L[−i + 1] ∈ H 0(A /F [n]) is mapped to
(L[−i + 1], 0, . . . , 0), which is isomorphic in H 0(B/G[1]) to (G[1])i−1(L[−i + 1], 0, . . . , 0) = (0, . . . , L, . . . , 0)
(cid:3)
with L at the i-th factor.

Applying 5.2 to ﬁnite dimensional algebras, we can realize the (d+n)-cluster category of a ﬁnite dimensional
algebra A of global dimension ≤ d as the canonical triangulated hull of the orbit category of n-fold product
algebra.

Example 5.3. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra of global dimension ≤ d, and θd → RHomA(DA, A)[d]
the bimodule projective resolution. Consider the pretriangulated dg category and its dg endofunctor given by
A = C b(proj A), F = − ⊗A θd : A → A .

cf. 3.1. Let us now consider the dg orbit category B/G[1] in 5.2. Putting B = A × · · · × A, we have

6. Combinatorial roots of τ

We give a description of quivers whose derived categories have some roots of the AR translation. Observing
that a root of τ in the derived category of a quiver Q gives rise to a root of τ as an automorphism of the
inﬁnite translation quiver ZQ, we give a necessarily and suﬃcient condition for Q to have such a root on ZQ.
Throughout this section let Q be a ﬁnite acyclic quiver. Note that we do not assume it is connected.
Suppose that there exists an autoequivalence F of D b(mod kQ) such that F l ≃ τ −1 for some l ≥ 1. We
ﬁrst translate this categorical autoequivalence into a combinatorial one on the inﬁnite translation quiver ZQ
[ASS, Hap]. We say that two quivers are derived equivalent if their path algebras are derived equivalent. This
is the case if and only if their inﬁnite translation quivers are isomorphic.
Lemma 6.1. Let F be a triangle autoequivalence of D b(mod kQ) such that F l ≃ τ −1. Then F induces an
automorphism F ′ of the translation quiver ZQ such that (F ′)l = τ −1.
Proof. The proof depends on the description of AR components of D b(mod kQ) (see [Hap, I.5.6]). Divide the
components of Q into the derived equivalence classes Q1 ⊔ · · · ⊔ Qn. Then F acts on each derived category
D b(mod kQi) so we may assume that the components of Q are mutually derived equivalent. Suppose ﬁrst
that each component of Q is Dynkin. Then the AR quiver of D b(mod kQ) is ZQ, thus F gives a desired
autoequivalence. We now suppose that Q is non-Dynkin and decompose it into the components Q1 ⊔ · · · ⊔ Qn.
Then the AR quiver of D b(mod kQ) contains the components Cp(Qi) ≃ ZQi each of which is characterized as
the component containing kQi[p] ∈ D b(mod kQ). In view of the shape of the AR quiver of D b(mod kQ), the
Cp(Qi). Then there
triangle autoequivalence F induces an automorphism of the translation quiver
exists a permutation σ on {1, . . . , n} and pi ∈ Z such that the component C0(Qi) is mapped to Cpi (Qσ(i)). Let
G be the triangle automorphism of D b(mod kQ) = D b(mod kQ1)×· · ·×D b(mod kQn) given by (L1, . . . , Ln) 7→
(L1[−pσ−1(1)], . . . , Ln[−pσ−1(n)]). Then the composite F ′ := G ◦ F preserves C0(Q1) ⊔ · · · ⊔ C0(Qn) ≃ ZQ,
(cid:3)
whose l-th power equals τ −1.

Recall that a section of ZQ [ASS, VIII.1.2], (also [ABS, 7]) is a full subquiver Σ of ZQ such that

• each τ -orbit of ZQ intersects Σ exactly once.
• If x → y is an arrow in ZQ and x ∈ Σ, then y ∈ Σ or τ y ∈ Σ.

If Σ is a section of ZQ then there is an isomorphism ZΣ ≃ ZQ of translation quivers [ASS, VIII.1.6]. The
following main result in this section shows that we can take a section as an orbit under the root of τ .
Theorem 6.2. Let Q be a ﬁnite acyclic quiver and F an automorphism of ZQ such that F l = τ −1. Then
there exists a full subquiver T of ZQ such that the full subquiver consisting of T ∪ F T ∪ · · · ∪ F l−1T forms a
section of ZQ. Moreover, for any points s, t ∈ T and a > 0, there is no arrow from F as to t.

Consequently, we can characterize the quivers whose inﬁnite translation quiver ZQ has an l-th root of τ .
Corollary 6.3. There exists an l-th root of τ −1 on ZQ if and only if Q is derived equivalent to the quiver Q′
satisfying the following (a), (b) and (c).

(a) Q′ has l copies T (0), T (1), . . . , T (l−1) of a quiver T as a full subquiver.

We denote by F the permutation of the vertices of Q′ taking T (i) to T (i+1), where T (l) := T (0).

(b) There are additional arrows x → y in Q′ with x ∈ T (i), y ∈ T (j) only if i < j.
(c) F extends to an automorphism of the underlying graph of Q′.

For the proof let us introduce the notion of “a section with respect to a root of τ ”.

Deﬁnition 6.4. Let F be an automorphism of ZQ such that F l = τ −1. An F -section of ZQ is a full subquiver
T of ZQ satisfying the following.

/

MORITA THEOREM FOR HEREDITARY CALABI-YAU CATEGORIES

29

(a) Each F -orbit of ZQ intersects T exactly once.
(b) If t → x is an arrow in ZQ and t ∈ T then x ∈ T ∪ F T ∪ · · · ∪ F l−1T or τ x ∈ T .

Clearly the condition (b) is equivalent to its dual, which have the following form.
(b’) If x → t is an arrow in ZQ and t ∈ T then x ∈ T or τ −1x ∈ T ∪ F T ∪ · · · ∪ F l−1T .
The following observation shows that an F -section gives a desired (τ -)section of ZQ.

Lemma 6.5. Let T be an F -section of ZQ. Then Σ = T ∪ F T ∪ · · · ∪ F l−1T is a section of ZQ.

Proof. It is easily seen that Σ forms a complete set of representatives of the τ -orbits of ZQ. Let x ∈ Σ and
2l−1
x → y an arrow in ZQ. We have to show y ∈ Σ or τ y ∈ Σ, that is, y ∈
i=0 F iT . Since x ∈ Σ we have
x ∈ F aT for some 0 ≤ a ≤ l − 1. Then y ∈ F aΣ or τ y ∈ F aT since T is an F -section.
It follows that

Construction 6.6. We construct an F -section as a subquiver of the standard section Q of ZQ. Let T be the
subquiver of Q such that each vertex x of Q can be written uniquely as x = F at for some t ∈ T and a ≥ 0.
Thus T is obtained by dividing the vertices of Q into F -orbits, and taking from each orbit the vertices which
are written as the smallest powers of F .
Example 6.7. Let Q be the quiver of linearly oriented type A4. Then the inﬁnite translation quiver ZQ has
a square root of τ −1, indeed, consider the automorphism F which “turns up side down”, moving slightly to
the right.

The standard section Q which is depicted in the dotted line consists of two F -orbits; letting x its source and
y the adjacent vertex, the other two vertices are F y and F 3x. Then the construction says T = {x, y}.

Proposition 6.8. The quiver T given in 6.6 is an F -section of ZQ.

To prove this we need some observations on the arrows in Q with sources or targets in T .

Lemma 6.9. Let x → t be an arrow in Q with t ∈ T . Then x ∈ T .

Proof. Since x ∈ Q we can write x = F as for some s ∈ T and a ≥ 0. Then there is an arrow s → F −at with
s ∈ Q. Since Q is a section we have F −at ∈ Q or F −a−lt = τ F −at ∈ Q, but by our construction of T , F pt ∈ Q
(cid:3)
for some p ∈ Z forces p ≥ 0, thus we must have a = 0, hence x = s ∈ T .

Lemma 6.10. Let t → x be an arrow in Q with t ∈ T . Then x ∈ T ∪ F T ∪ · · · ∪ F l−1T .

Proof. Since x ∈ Q we can write x = F as with s ∈ T and a ≥ 0. We have to show a ≤ l − 1. Consider the
arrow F −at → s. Since s ∈ Q and Q is a section, we have F −at ∈ Q or τ −1F −at ∈ Q. If F −at ∈ Q then
F −at ∈ T by 6.9, hence a = 0. If τ −1F −at, which equals F l−at, is in Q, we must have l − a ≥ 0 by the
construction of T . It remains to exclude a = l. In this case, we have that both s and x = F as = τ −1s lies in
(cid:3)
Q, which is absurd.

Proof of 6.8. It is clear from the construction that each F -orbits in ZQ intersects T exactly once. Let t → x
be an arrow in ZQ with t ∈ T . Since t ∈ Q and Q is a section, we have x ∈ Q or τ x ∈ Q. If x ∈ Q, then
(cid:3)
x ∈ T ∪ F T ∪ · · · ∪ F l−1T by 6.10 . If τ x ∈ Q, then τ x ∈ T by 6.9.

Now we are ready to prove the main results of this section.

Proof of 6.2. The ﬁrst assertion follows from 6.8 and 6.5, so we prove the second one. Let s, t ∈ T and
F as → t an arrow in ZQ. We have to show a ≤ 0. Since T is an F -section we have F as ∈ T or τ −1F as ∈
T ∪ F T ∪ · · · ∪ F l−1T .
If F as ∈ T then a = 0 since T intersects each F -orbit only once. Similarly if
τ −1F as ∈ T ∪ F T ∪ · · · ∪ F l−1T then comparing the exponent of F , we must have 0 ≤ a + l ≤ l − 1, thus
(cid:3)
a ≤ −1.

For a pair x, y in a quiver we denote by {x → y} (resp. {x − y}) the set of arrows from x to y (resp.

unoriented edges between x and y).
Proof of 6.3. We ﬁrst show the “only if” part. Suppose ZQ has an l-th root F of τ −1. Then by 6.2 there
exists a subquiver T of Q such that Q′ := T ∪ F T ∪ · · · ∪ F l−1T is a section of ZQ. We claim that this Q′
has the desired properties. Letting T (i) be the full subquiver of Q′ consisting of the vertices from F iT we
have (a). Also the second assertion in 6.2 shows (b). Now we turn to (c). For each point t ∈ T we write t(i)
the corresponding point in T (i). We have to show ♯{s(i) − t(j)} = ♯{s(i+1) − t(j+1)}, where the superscripts
are read modulo l. We may assume i < j, and the assertion is clear if j < l − 1. If j = l − 1, then we have
♯{s(i) − t(l−1)} = ♯{F is − F l−1t} = ♯{F i+1s − F lt} = ♯{t − F i+1s} since F l = τ −1, and the last term equals
♯{t − s(i+1)}.

We next show the “if” part. We may assume Q = Q′, satisfying (a), (b), and (c). Deﬁne the automorphism
on the set of vertices of ZQ by taking T (i) to T (i+1) for 0 ≤ i < l − 1, and T (l−1) to τ −1T (0), via F . It is easily
(cid:3)
seen that this extends to the automorphism of ZQ whose l-th power is τ −1.

We end this section with a complete list of connected Dynkin quivers whose inﬁnite translation quivers have

roots of τ .
Example 6.11. Let Q be a connected Dynkin quiver and l ≥ 2. Then ZQ has an l-th root of τ if and only
if l = 2 and Q is of even type A. Indeed, suppose that ZQ has an l-th root of τ . We use that the underlying
graph of Q has a free action of Z/lZ (6.3(c)). We can exclude type D and E since it has only one trivalent
node. Then Q has to be of type A, which has exactly two univalent nodes. This forces l = 2 and thus the
number of vertices to be even. Conversely if Q is of even type A, then the automorphism of ZQ which turns
up-side-down as in 6.7 gives a square root of τ .

7. Application: Calabi-Yau reduction of cluster categories

Let us start with a reduction process, called Calabi-Yau reduction, of triangulated categories, which yields

a smaller CY triangulated category from a given one.
Theorem 7.1 ([IYo, Section 4]). Let T be a d-CY triangulated category and P ⊂ T a functorially ﬁnite
d-rigid subcategory. Put Z = {X ∈ T | T (P, X[i]) = 0 for all P ∈ P and 0 < i < d}.

(1) The additive quotient U := Z /[P] has a natural structure of a triangulated category, which is d-CY.
(2) The projection Z → U induces a bijection between the set of d-cluster tilting subcategories of T

containing P, and the set of d-cluster tilting subcategories of U .

(3) The projection Z → U preserves AR (d+2)-angles, that is, if C ⊂ T be a d-cluster tilting subcategory
containing P, then for each indecomposable C ∈ Z \ P the image of the AR (d + 2)-angle at C in C
is the AR (d + 2)-angle at C in U .

We apply this CY reduction to an important class of CY triangulated categories with cluster tilting objects,
namely the cluster categories of ﬁnite dimensional algebras. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra which is
d A) = 0 for almost all i ∈ Z where
νd-ﬁnite [Iy2, Am2], that is, we have gl. dim A ≤ d and HomD(A)(A, ν−i
A DA and νd = ν ◦ [−d]. Then the d-cluster category Cd(A) of A is the cluster category of the
ν = − ⊗L
(d + 1)-CY completion Πd+1(A) of A, which is also the triangulated hull of the orbit category D b(mod A)/νd;
D b(mod A)/νd ֒→ Cd(A) = C (Πd+1(A)).
It is a Hom-ﬁnite d-CY triangulated category with a d-cluster titling obejct A ∈ Cd(A) [Am2, Gu], whose
endomorphism algebra is the (d + 1)-preprojective algebra Πd+1(A) [IO] of A.

Recall that an idempotent e is stratifying if the restriction functor D(Mod A/(e)) → D(Mod A) along
A → A/(e) is fully faithful. It is known [IYa, Ke5] that the CY reduction of the cluster category Cd(A) with
respect to a stratifying idempotent e ∈ A is the cluster category Cd(A/(e)). In this section, we apply our main

MORITA THEOREM FOR HEREDITARY CALABI-YAU CATEGORIES

31

result to give a description of the CY reduction by a non-stratifying idempotent, and in particular observe
that it is not necessarily the cluster category of the quotient algebra.

Applying 4.15 to a CY reduction of the 3-cluster category gives the following result.

Proposition 7.2. Let A be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra which is ν3-ﬁnite and Π its 4-preprojective algebra.
Suppose e ∈ A is idempotent such that Π/(e) is hereditary. Consider the CY reduction U of C3(A) with
respect to eA.

(1) The algebra H = EndU (A ⊕ A[−1]) is hereditary.
(2) When H is 1-representation inﬁnite and H/JH is separable over k, there is triangle equivalence T ≃

D b(mod H)/τ −1/2[1].

In the rest of this subsection let A be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra of global dimension ≤ 2, and C its
3-cluster category. Then the 4-preprojective algebra C (A, A) of A is just A. Let us describe the hereditary
algebra H explicitly in this case. For this we give a general description of AR 5-angles at A in C . We start
with an easy computation.

Lemma 7.3. We have C (A, A[−1]) = Ext2

A(DA, A).

Proof. This is easily seen by C (A, A[−1]) =

i∈Z HomD(A)(A, ν−i

3 A[−1]), in which only i = 1 survives.

(cid:3)

Let P be an indecomposable direct summand of A and S the corresponding simple A-module. We let

add A ⊂ C at P is of the form

for some Q ∈ add A and X ∈ C . In fact we can also determine Q.

Lemma 7.4. We have Q = P2 ⊕ ν−1I 2.
Proof. Since Q → X is a minimal right (add A)-approximation in C , the morphism C (A, Q) → C (A, X) is a
projective cover, thus we have to determine the A-module C (A, X). By the ﬁrst triangle we have an exact
sequence

C (A, P1[−1])

/ C (A, P0[−1])

/ C (A, X)

/ C (A, P1)

/ C (A, P0) .

The rightmost map is isomorphic to P1 → P0, thus has projective kernel P2. On the other hand, the left-
most map is isomorphic by 7.3 to Ext2
A(DA, S) since
Ext2

A(DA, P0), thus its cokernel is Ext2
A(DA, P1) → Ext2
A(DA, −) is right exact by gl. dim A ≤ 2. Therefore we obtain a split short exact sequence

Now we describe the algebra H. Suppose A is given by a quiver with relations; A = kQ/I and let R be a
minimal set of relations generating I. Recall that the minimal projective and injective resolutions of simple
modules are controlled by the arrows and the relations ([BIRS, Section 3]), precisely, we have exact sequences

We therefore obtain the following explicit description of H.

Theorem 7.5. Let A = kQ/(R) be a ﬁnite dimensional algebra of global dimension ≤ 2 given by quiver Q
and a minimal set of relations R. Let e ∈ A be an idempotent such that A/(e) is hereditary, and consider the
CY reduction U of the 3-cluster category of A with respect to eA.

(1) The algebra H = EndU (A ⊕ A[−1]) is the path algebra of the quiver

Q obtained as follows.

(i) Consider two copies of the quiver Q obtained from Q by deleting the vertices corresponding to e.

For each vertex a ∈ Q we denote by a′ the corresponding vertex in the other copy.

e

(ii) For each relation a → b in R with a, b ∈ Q, add arrows a → b′ and b → a′.

(2) If each connected component of

Q is non-Dynkin, then there exists a triangle equivalence
U ≃ D b(mod k
e

Q)/τ −1/2[1].

Proof. The triangle equivalence is given in 7.2 so we only have to prove (1). Clearly the quiver of H has two
copies of Q as a subquiver, and by 2.13 the arrows between these copies are given by the middle terms of the
AR 5-angles in U . By 7.1(3) they are the image of the ones in C , whose middle terms are as in 7.4. We then
(cid:3)
deduce the result by the remark on resolutions of simple modules.

e

The following example shows that a CY reduction of a usual 3-cluster category of a ﬁnite dimensional

algebra is not a usual 3-cluster category; it involves a square root of the AR translation.

Example 7.6. Let A be the algebra presented by the following quiver with relations, which has global
dimension 2.

8. Application: Singularity categories of truncated skew group algebras

Throughout this section let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0, S = k[x0, . . . , xd] the
polynomial ring, and G a ﬁnite subgroup of SLd+1(k), which acts naturally on S. Let R = SG the invariant ring
and S ∗G the skew group algebra, that is, the vector space S ⊗k kG with multiplication (s⊗g)(t⊗h) = sg(t)⊗gh
for s, t ∈ S and g, h ∈ G. The following result gives examples of CY triangulated categories with cluster tilting
objects.

Theorem 8.1 ([IYo, 10.1], [AIR, 2.3]). Let e be an idempotent of Γ = S ∗ G such that Γ/(e) is ﬁnite
dimensional. Put Λ = eΓe.

(1) The algebra Λ is a symmetric R-order, thus the singularity category CM Λ is d-CY.
(2) The Λ-module T = Γe is Cohen-Macaulay and is d-cluster tilting in CM Λ.
(3) We have EndΛ(T ) = Γ/(e).

In what follows we use a standard notation for elements in GLn(k):

1/a(a1, . . . , an) for diag(ζa1 , . . . , ζan ) ∈ GLn(k) for a ﬁxed primitive a-th root of unity ζ.

for a, a1, . . . , an ∈ Z, we write

Lemma 8.2. Let G ⊂ SLd+1(k) is the cyclic subgroup generated by 1/n(a0, . . . , ad).

(1) The McKay quiver Q of G has vertices Z/nZ = {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} and arrows xi : j → j + ai.
(2) The skew group algebra Γ is presented by Q with commutativity relations.

We view Q as an {x0, . . . , xd}-colored quiver. Let e ∈ Γ be an idempotent and let I be the corresponding subset
of the vertices of Q.

(3) Γ/(e) is presented by the quiver Q \ I obtained from Q by removing the vertices in I.
(4) Γ/(e) is ﬁnite dimensional hereditary if and only if there are no cycles consisting of arrows of a single

color, nor composable arrows of diﬀerent colors in Q \ I.

[CMT, 2.8][BSW, 4.1]), and (3) is then clear. We verify
Proof. (1) is obvious, (2) is well-known (see e.g.
(4). If Q \ I has no cycles of a single color and no composable arrows of diﬀerent colors, then there are no
relations on Q \ I since Γ has only commutativity relations. Also the assumption implies that Q \ I is acyclic.
Therefore Γ/(e) is ﬁnite dimensional and hereditary. Conversely, if Q \ I has a cycle of a single color, then
Γ/(e) is inﬁnite dimensional. If Q \ I has composable arrows of diﬀerent colors, then it has a relation. Indeed,
let a

Let G = h1/n(a0, . . . , ad)i ⊂ SLd+1(k) and its McKay quiver Q as in 8.2 above. We naturally regard
ai ∈ Z/nZ. Let Mj be the indecomposable direct summand of S corresponding to the vertices j of Q. Then
the construction of almost split sequences and a computation of exterior powers show that it is given for Mj
by the exact sequence

Now let e ∈ Γ is an idempotent as in 8.1, I the corresponding subset of the vertives of Q, and M the
corresponding direct summand of S. Putting Nj = HomR(M, Mj) ∈ CM Λ, the AR sequence at Nj in
add Γe ⊂ CM Λ is

Example 8.3. Let S = k[x, y, z, w] and G the cyclic subgroup of SL4(k) generated by 1/n(a0, a1, a2, a3)
with 0 ≤ ai ≤ n − 1. Assume that a0 = 1, and a1, a2, a3 > 1. Moreover pick an integer l > 0 such that
l−1 ≤ a1, a2, a3 ≤ n−l and let e := e0+el+1+· · ·+en−1 = 1−(e1+· · ·+el). Putting M = M0⊕Ml+1⊕· · ·⊕Mn−1
we have Λ = eΓe = EndR(M ), and by 8.1 the stable category CM Λ is 3-CY and N = N1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Nl ∈ CM Λ
with Ni := HomR(M, Mi) is 3-cluster tilting. By 8.1(4) we see that EndΛ(N ) = Γ/(e) is hereditary whose
quiver as below, where the number of arrows 1 → l is the number of a1, a2, a3 which equals l − 1.

The next example is a 4-CY category CM Λ with a semisimple 4-cluster tilting object N . In this case the

algebra EndΛ(N ⊕ N [−1]) is clearly hereditary, so we can apply 4.16.
Example 8.4. Let G ⊂ SL5(k) be the cyclic subgroup generated by 1/n(a0, a1, a2, a3, a4) with 1 ≤ ai ≤ n − 1.
(1) Let e0 a primitive idempotent of Γ = S ∗ G, e = 1 − e0, and M0 (resp. M ) the R-module summand of

S corresponding to e0 (resp. e). Then the almost split sequence at M0 in CM R is given by

(2) More generally, let I0 be a subset of Z/nZ such that for each j, j′ ∈ I0 we have j − j′ 6= ai for any
0 ≤ i ≤ 4. Then letting e be the idempotent of Γ corresponding to J := Z/nZ \ I0, the algebra Γ/(e) is
semisimple. Also the AR 6-angle in add Γe ⊂ CM Λ is

where mjl is the number of pairs (ai1 , ai2 ) with 0 ≤ i1 < i2 ≤ 4 such that ai1 + ai2 = l − j in Z/nZ. By 2.22
the algebra H = EndΛ(N ⊕ N [−1] ⊕ N [−2]) is the path algebra of the quiver given as follows.

• mjl arrows from (j, 0) to (l, −1) and from (j, −1) to (l, −2), and mlj arrows from (j, 0) to (l, −2).
The quiver of H looks as in the following picture, where the same kind of arrows indicates that there are same
number of arrows. By 4.16 we have a triangle equivalence below.
