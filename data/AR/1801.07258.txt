ABSTRACT

Aims. AR Scorpii is unique amongst known white dwarf binaries in showing powerful pulsations extending to radio frequencies. Here
we aim to investigate the multi-frequency radio emission of AR Sco in detail, in order to constrain its origin and emission mechanisms.
Methods. We present interferometric radio frequency imaging of AR Sco at 1.5, 5 and 9 GHz, analysing the total ﬂux and polarization
behaviour of this source at high time resolution (10, 3 and 3 s), across a full 3.6 hr orbital period in each band.
Results. We ﬁnd strong modulation of the radio ﬂux on the orbital period and the orbital sideband of the white dwarf’s spin period
(also known as the "beat" period). This indicates that, like the optical ﬂux, the radio ﬂux arises predominantly from on or near the
inner surface of the M-dwarf companion star. The beat-phase pulsations of AR Sco decrease in strength with decreasing frequency.
They are strongest at 9 GHz and at an orbital phase ∼0.5. Unlike the optical emission from this source, radio emission from AR Sco
shows weak linear polarization but very strong circular polarization, reaching ∼30% at an orbital phase ∼0.8. We infer the probable
existence of a non-relativistic cyclotron emission component, which dominates at low radio frequencies. Given the required magnetic
ﬁelds, this also likely arises from on or near the M-dwarf.

1. Introduction

AR Scorpii (hereafter AR Sco) is a white dwarf / M dwarf close
binary with an orbital period of 3.6 hr (Marsh et al. 2016). It
shows strong pulsations in brightness associated with the 117.1 s
spin period of its white dwarf, which, uniquely, are seen from
the ultraviolet all the way to radio frequencies. The mismatch
between spin and orbital periods suggest a relation with the in-
termediate polar class of white dwarf binaries in which an ac-
creting magnetic white dwarf spins faster than the binary or-
bit due to accretion from a disc that is disrupted close to the
white dwarf, where the magnetic ﬁeld dominates (e.g. Wickra-
masinghe & Meggitt 1982). However, the source shows little or
no evidence for an accretion disc which might suggest a more
natural match to the asynchronous polars, in which the diﬀer-
ence between spin and orbital periods is likely attributable to an
impulse from a nova event (Stockman et al. 1988). On the other
hand, asynchronous polars typically present an orbit-spin period
diﬀerence of less than 1% (Warner 2002), and AR Sco is far from
meeting that criterion. In fact, AR Sco is distinct from all known
white dwarf / main sequence binary systems in a number of key
respects, but primarily in the lack of any evidence for accretion
and the great strength of its pulsations which are almost 100%
modulated at ultraviolet wavelengths and which extend all the
way to radio wavelengths.

Marsh et al. identiﬁed three dominant components in the fre-
quency spectrum of AR Sco’s ﬂux variability: the orbital period
of the binary around its barycentre (3.56 hours), the spin period
of the white dwarf (117.1 s) and the beat period between these
(118.2 s). Given the strength of the beat period, and the power-
law spectral energy distribution extending from the optical to the
radio, it was proposed that the source ﬂux was dominated by syn-
chrotron emission, arising from an interaction between the two
components of the binary. Further, the lack of clear signatures of

an accretion disk component in the spectrum, together with the
energy requirements of the system, suggested that this emission
was powered by energy liberated by the spin down of a magnetic,
rapidly-rotating white dwarf.

AR Sco has since been the subject of intensive investiga-
tion and theoretical analysis. Littleﬁeld et al. (2017), using op-
tical data from Kepler and CRTS, reﬁned the orbital parameters
and demonstrated that while the orbital waveform is stable on
timescales of ∼ 78 days (the duration of the K2 campaign), it
alters slowly over timescales on the order of years, while also
showing aperiodic variations superimposed on the regular pe-
riodic ﬂux changes. Marcote et al. (2017) presented observa-
tions taken at 8.5 GHz with the Australian Long Baseline Array
(LBA) which conﬁrmed that the radio emission originates from a
compact point source, with no evidence for extended radio jets.
Buckley et al. (2017) obtained polarimetric data in the optical,
identifying very strong (40%) spin-modulated linear polariza-
tion, and a few percent circular polarization, which also varies
with time. These observations strengthen the case for interpreta-
tion of AR Sco as the ﬁrst-known white dwarf pulsar, with ∼ 6%
of the spin-down power reprocessed by magnetospheric interac-
tions to generate a self-absorbed synchrotron spectrum that dom-
inates from the radio to the optical.

The initial model proposed by Marsh et al. (2016) was of
a rapidly rotating white dwarf, whose bipolar magnetic ﬁeld
‘whips’ past the tidally-locked red dwarf twice in every spin ex-
citing emission from a hotspot on the face of the M-dwarf di-
rected towards the white dwarf. The binary orbital motion then
leads to a dominant modulation on the beat period. Geng et al.
(2016) developed this model further, identiﬁying AR Sco as a
near-perpendicular rotator whose open ﬁeld lines sweep through
the M-dwarf’s stellar wind, accelerating electrons in a bow shock
region above the M-dwarf surface. They note that, in their near

edge-on model, the hemisphere seen by the observer has mag-
netic ﬁeld directions which cancel out, suggesting that little cir-
cular polarization should be seen. Katz (2017) has also devel-
oped a model for this system, suggesting that the white dwarf
spin-down energy is instead dissipated through magnetic recon-
nection in the M-dwarf atmosphere, dubbing this process syn-
chronization, and the system as a whole a synchronar. In this
model AR Sco occupies a short-lived, transitional state lying
between intermediate polars (which contain a rapidly rotating
white dwarf in a binary with a tidally-locked red dwarf) and tra-
ditional polars (in which the white dwarf spin is magnetically
locked to the orbital period: the ﬁeld lines of the white dwarf
interact with the ﬁeld of the companion, and force the white
dwarf into synchronous rotation). This model naturally accounts
for shifts of the ﬂux maximum away from mid-orbital phase due
to precession of the magnetic poles, and for rapid ﬂaring due to
magnetic storms in the M-dwarf atmosphere. Given the complex
and challenging task of modelling this source, additional data are
useful for reﬁning the interpretation.

While the radio observations presented by Marsh et al.
(2016) conﬁrmed the unusual nature of this source, they were
limited to a single hour of data at low spatial resolution, and so
could not constrain the orbital modulation in the radio. Simi-
larly, those taken with the VLBI and presented by Marcote et al.
(2017) conﬁrmed AR Sco’s identity as a point source and were
able to recover an orbital variation lightcurve, but had neither
the time resolution nor the frequency range to fully explore the
properties of this source in the radio.

In this paper we present high time resolution radio data ob-
tained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 1
5 and 9 GHz (L, C and X bands respectively), and use this to
explore the properties of AR Sco on diﬀerent timescales. We
present our data acquisition and reduction in section 2. In section
3 we consider the radio properties of AR Sco on timescales of
the orbital period, while in section 4 we identify and investigate
pulsations on the system beat period. In section 5 we investigate
evidence for polarization in the source. In section 6 we discuss
and interpret the radio properties of AR Sco, before presenting
our conclusions in section 7.

2. Data Acquisition and Reduction

2.1. Radio Observations

Radio observations of AR Scorpii were obtained at the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) between 2016 April 28 and
2016 May 021. Data were taken at frequencies centred around
1.5 GHz (L band, 6 hours), 5 GHz (C band, 4 hours) and 9 GHz
(X band, 4 hours), where the integration length was chosen to
capture a full 3.6 hr orbital period (see table 1). Observations
were taken with the phase centre at the source location. At 5&
9 GHz, the visibilities were read out every 3 seconds, while at
1.5 GHz a readout interval of 1 s was selected. All observations
were taken with the telescope in the CnB-conﬁguration. Full po-
larization information was recorded, and the standard broadband
continuum correlator conﬁguration adopted, with a frequency
coverage of 1.5 ± 0.5 GHz, 5.0 ± 1.0 GHz and 9.0 ± 1.0 GHz. In
the 1.5 GHz band, two spectral windows (each of 64 MHz band-
width) were impossible to calibrate due to strong radio frequency
interference (RFI) throughout the calibrator observations, and
are omitted from the analysis. In all bands, RFI was ﬂagged
as required. Absolute ﬂux and secondary phase calibration were

performed using observations of standard calibrators 3C286 and
J1626-2951 respectively.

Data were reduced (i.e. automatically ﬂagged, bandpass,
gain and ﬂux calibrated) using the standard VLA data reduction
pipeline, integrated in the Common Astronomy Software Appli-
cations (CASA, v4.5.2) package. This performs a reduction of
continuum data in the Stokes I parameter, calibrating total ﬂux.
Further ﬂagging was performed where necessary (particularly in
the 1.5 GHz band) before subsets of the data were imaged, using
the CLEAN task of CASA. A ‘Clark’ cleaning algorithm was
used, with a Briggs weighting parameter of 0.5. Images were
constructed using a 1 arcsecond sampling in the 1.5 GHz band,
and 0.75 arcsecond sampling in the 5 and 9 GHz bands.

AR Sco was clearly detected at all bands, even in very short
integrations (10 s at 1.5 GHz, 3 s at 5 and 9 GHz). All bands also
show evidence for temporal variability on multiple timescales.
Source ﬂuxes were determined using the CASA IMFIT com-
mand on a region centred at the source location. In the 5 and
9 GHz bands, the source was straightforwardly ﬁt as a single
object. In the 1.5 GHz band, the ﬂux from AR Sco is some-
what confused with a neighbouring source at a separation of
14.3 arcsecond in RA and 1.2 arcseconds in Declination, which
contributed substantially to the archival NVSS ﬂux for AR Sco,
as ﬁgure 1 demonstrates. The source separation is comparable
to the synthesized beam of the VLA at this declination and fre-
quency, and so may cause problems, particularly if the primary
beam major axis is oriented East-West. Given that each subset of
the data has a diﬀerent uv-plane coverage, the severity of this is-
sue varies and is considered on a case by case basis. In this band,
the two objects were ﬁt simultaneously as point sources. A good
ﬁt could be obtained in all cases.

The neighbouring object at RA & DEC 16h21m46.26s -
22053(cid:48)11.86(cid:48)(cid:48) (J2000) is consistent with a point source, with no
signiﬁcant temporal variability and a ﬂux of 3.49±0.08 mJy at
1.5 GHz.

We note that the strong variability of AR Sco can cause prob-
lems with image reconstruction from visibility data, and thus that
IMFIT typically reports the system as being extended in long
integrations, despite its point source nature (see Marcote et al.
2017). This is particularly true in the 9 GHz band, and we use the
integrated ﬁt properties (i.e. the ﬂux appropriate for an extended
source) in this band, while treating AR Sco as a point source in
the other bands. We have checked that this makes no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence to ﬂux measurements at 1.5 and 5 GHz, but it cor-
rects for the 30% of ﬂux in the 9 GHz band which would be lost
if peak ﬂux was considered instead.

bital intervals since the zero orbital phase deﬁned in Marsh et al. (2016).

2.2. Optical Observations

To improve our constraints on source ephemerides and monitor
for unusual behaviour in AR Sco, we obtained high time resolu-
tion, near-contemporaneous optical observations in two sessions
which straddle the dates on which the VLA observed the target,
as Figure 2 illustrates. These observations were obtained using
the dual-band high speed imager on the Warwick 1m telescope
(W1m) on La Palma. Each observation lasted ∼ 4 hrs, and data
were collected simultaneously in blue and red ﬁlters with inte-
grations of 10 s on 2016 Apr 29 and of 2.5 and 5 s respectively
on 2016 May 04. The blue ﬁlter has a wide optical bandpass, us-
ing BG40 glass, with peak eﬃciency at ∼5500Å. The red ﬁlter
is a Z-band, with peak throughput at ∼8800Å. Due to the 3.3 s
detector readout time between integrations, the 10 s integrations
are more eﬃcient in terms of on-sky observing time (see table
1), while the shorter integrations capture more of the dynamic
behaviour of this unusual source. Target ﬂux calibration was per-
formed relative to a nearby, non-variable point source to account
for any possible seeing or sky brightness variations.

full orbital period. The dashed line indicates a ﬁt in the form Fν ∝ να to
the spectral slope in the 5 and 9 GHz bands, extrapolated to the 1.5 GHz
band. The best ﬁt is found at α = 0.358 ± 0.015.

3. Orbital Period Properties

3.1. SED and spectral slope

In order to determine the time-averaged spectral energy distri-
bution of AR Sco, images were generated from a 3.6 hr (i.e. full
orbital period) interval of observations in each radio band. A sec-
ondary phase calibrator was visited every 10-15 minutes, with
approximately 2 minutes oﬀ-target on each occasion. As a re-
sult, the coverage is not fully continuous; the lacunae in the time
series are randomly placed with respect to the orbit in each band.
A multifrequency synthesis covering this period was gener-
ated for each spectral window (i.e. each covering a bandwidth
of 64 MHz in the 1.5 GHz band, 128 MHz in the 5 and 9 GHz
bands), and the ﬂux of AR Sco in each image determined. In
Figure 3 we show the orbit-averaged spectral energy distribution
(SED) of AR Sco. Due to the lower signal to noise in the 1.5 GHz
band, and its diﬀerent pulsation behaviour (see below), we do not
use it to constrain the power law ﬁtted to the higher frequency
data. The data at 5 and 9 GHz are consistent with a power law
SED with Fν ∝ να, where α = 0.358 ± 0.015. While there is a
hint that a slightly steeper power law may be appropriate within
the 5 GHz band, the overall ﬁt is good, with an extrapolation of
the high frequency power law contributing >90% of the ﬂux in
the 1.5 GHz band. The 4-10 GHz power law ﬁt is similar in spec-
tral slope to the observed ﬂux variation within both the 1.5 and
9 GHz bands.

3.2. Orbital variation

In order to determine ﬂux variability on the orbital period of the
system, known from optical observations to be 3.6 hours, we
image the ﬁeld and measure the ﬂux of AR Sco on intervals cor-
responding to individual on-source scans, between phase cali-
brator observations. These have a duration of 10 minutes in the
1.5 and 5 GHz bands, and 15 minutes in the 9 GHz band and so
are suﬃciently long to average over the 118 s spin/beat periods
also known from the optical data. We image the data in 1 GHz
bandwidths centred at 1.5, 4.5, 5.5, 8.5 and 9.5 GHz (i.e. split-
ting the C and X band observations into high and low frequency
subbands).

where E is an orbit number and the time scale is TDB, corrected
to the barycentre of the solar system, expressed as a Modiﬁed Ju-
lian Day number (BMJD = JD - 2400000.5 + barycentric correc-
tion). Zero phase is interpreted as the red dwarf lying closest to
the observer along the line of sight. The optical data within each
observation have been phase-folded and binned at 0.05 phase in-
tervals with the mean at each phase, in each of the two observing
epochs (2016-04-29 and 2016-05-02), plotted in the ﬁgure at an
arbitrary ﬂux level. The results are shown twice (i.e. repeated at
phases between 1 and 2) to better illustrate the overall shape of
the orbital ﬂux variation.

As the Figure makes clear, there is considerable variation in
the shape of orbital ﬂux variation with frequency. Both the radio
data and the optical data reach minimum ﬂux at or just after or-
bital phase zero. Both are also consistent with small variations
in total ﬂux from orbit to orbit, with phase-matched data taken
in diﬀerent orbits not always equal in amplitude. However their
behaviour at peak (phase = 0.5) and the overall shape of emis-
sion diﬀers. The data at 8-10 GHz shows a smooth variation in
ﬂux from peak to trough, with a sharply deﬁned minimum and
a much broader maximum in the light curve. The 4-6 GHz data
shows a smaller diﬀerential between the width of maximum and
minimum, but a secondary dip in the ﬂux, overlying the peak and
occurring just before it in the lightcurve, appears and grows in
strength as the frequency drops. The result is a double peaked
light curve, with the ﬁrst peak (at a phase of ∼ 0.35) weaker
than the second (at phase ∼ 0.65). In the 1.5 GHz band this be-
haviour is more pronounced, with the bottom of the light curve
much broader and the peak heavily suppressed to leave a double-
peaked curve.

As a result, the 1-10 GHz spectral index of AR Sco, assuming
a simple power law, also varies with orbital phase as Figure 5
illustrates. Only those phases with data in all ﬁve subbands are
ﬁtted and shown. The spectral index decreases with increasing
orbital phase, peaking at α ∼ 0.5 at an orbital phase of 0.5 (peak
ﬂux), before falling to ∼0.1 at a phase of 1 (minimum ﬂux).

The fractional ﬂux variation on the orbital period, deﬁned as
( fmax − fmin)/( fmax + fmin), is 0.41, 0.44, 0.45, 0.41 and 0.40 at
1.5, 4.5, 5.5, 8.5 and 9.5 GHz respectively. Given the typical ﬂux
uncertainties and the probability that neither peak nor minimum
ﬂux are precisely sampled, this is consistent with a constant vari-
ation fraction with frequency.

4. Beat Period Properties

In order to explore the short time scale variation of AR Sco it is
necessary to image the radio data, and measure the source ﬂux,
at very short intervals. Fortunately, the brightness of the source
together with the very good uv-plane support for snapshot obser-
vations at the VLA allow this. We use a custom CASA python
script to generate a CLEANed image and to run the IMFIT task
on the visibility data for integration intervals of 3 s in the 5 and
9 GHz bands and 10 s in the 1.5 GHz band (where the source
is relatively faint and the beam is large). In each case, the full
bandwidth available (2 GHz, 2 GHz, 1 GHz respectively) is used.
AR Sco is well detected in all these images and IMFIT reports
that the source is a point source (as expected).

As before we ﬁt AR Sco alone in the 5 and 9 GHz bands,
and the target and neighbouring source simultaneously in the
L band. In a handful of intervals, the ﬁt failed to deconvolve
the two sources, but in the majority the ﬂux was successfully
measured. The detailed lightcurve of AR Sco in each frequency
band is shown in Figure 6, and demonstrates the extraordinary

Fig. 4. Flux variation over the orbital period of AR Sco. Data points rep-
resents integration over a 10 minute interval (15 minutes at 9 GHz), suf-
ﬁcient to average over the two minute beat period ﬂux variation. Results
are shown for 1 GHz bands centred at 1.5, 4.5, 5.5, 8.5 and 9.5 GHz.
The data are phase-folded in the interval between 0 and 1, and repeated
between 1 and 2 for clarity. For comparison we also show the W1m
optical data as small points in the bottom two lines. The optical data
in each observation have been phase folded and the mean in each phase
bin calculated; their ﬂuxes are arbitrarily scaled to indicate orbital phase
and shape in the optical. Where more than one point occurs at a given
frequency and phase, it indicates measurements in diﬀerent orbits.

AR Sco. Data points represent intervals of 0.05 in orbital phase for
which data in all bands is available. In each case, a simple power law ﬁt
has been performed to the ﬁve bands deﬁned in Figure 4

In Figure 4, we illustrate the frequency dependent total ﬂux
variability of AR Sco with orbital phase. These measurements
are phase folded based on the median phase of each scan, us-
ing the zero-phase deﬁnition of Marsh et al. combined with the
updated orbital period based on Kepler observations:

white dwarf spin (PS = 117.0 s, Marsh et al 2016). There is no
clear evidence for emission on the spin period suggesting that
the dominant power source for the radio emission lies in an in-
teraction between the white dwarf and its red dwarf companion.
The beat signal appears to decrease in strength with frequency. In
the 1.5 GHz band, this beat signal disappears, and the only sig-
niﬁcant peak in the power spectrum corresponds to the orbital
period, while the secondary peaks appear to be related to the
length of individual scans with the VLA. To verify this, we have
performed a test, subtracting a simple sinusoidal orbital modula-
tion from the 1.5 GHz data. The apparent periodogram features
at about 10 and 20 minutes period are heavily suppressed in a
periodogram of the residuals, conﬁrming that they are associated
with the window function of the data.

Phase-folding on the beat period, we are able to recover the
beat-pulse lightcurve at each frequency. A reference zero beat
phase is deﬁned at T0(beat)=57510.28387390 (BMJD), which
corresponds to a minimum at 5 GHz. This is shown in Figure 9,
where every datapoint has been normalised relative to the under-
lying orbital ﬂux variation, determined by calculating a running
mean across 450 seconds in each band. The plotted pulsation
fraction is therefore deﬁned by fobs,i/ fmean,∆i.

In the 5 GHz and 9 GHz bands, this pulsation fraction varies
throughout the orbital period, reaching a maximum of about
±20% with a 5% uncertainty. Taking the median value at each
phase, the typical pulsation varies from +4 to -8% around the
mean ﬂux in the beat cycle at 5 GHz and from +8 to -10% at
9 GHz. The beat oscillation is itself double peaked on the beat
period, but asymmetric, with the two peaks of unequal strength.
This behaviour was also seen in the near-infrared, optical and
ultraviolet (see Marsh et al 2016, Figure 2).

As Figures 10 and 11 demonstrate, the same asymmetric
double pulse within a beat period is identiﬁable in individual
beat cycles at the peak of the orbital lightcurve, and is clearly
detected at 5 and 9 GHz, with no apparent lag between them at a
given beat phase. The ratio of the two pulses varies signiﬁcantly
from pulse to pulse, as exempliﬁed by the example sequences
of three consecutive beats at each frequency in ﬁgure 11. The
two beats in each period are typically closer in strength at 5 GHz
than at 9 GHz, and not nearly so asymmetric as seen in the opti-
cal. There also appears to be a slight phase lag between the peaks
at optical frequencies and those in the radio.

The pulsations fade with decreasing frequency, and cannot
be clearly seen in the 1.5 GHz data, even at peak orbital ﬂux.
At the minimum of the orbital lightcurve (orbital phase = 0),
it becomes harder to identify pulsations at all frequencies, pri-
marily due to reduced signal to noise in the individual integra-
tions. By subdividing the data ﬁrst on orbital phase, and then
on beat phase, and calculating the median in 0.05 beat phase
bins (as in Figure 9), it is possible to look at how the pulsa-
tion strength varies with orbital phase, and we show this in the
bottom panel of Figure 10. Here we use the half-diﬀerence be-
tween the maximum and minimum in the orbit- and beat-folded,
median-averaged lightcurve as a proxy for pulsation strength.
The strongest pulsations, varying by 15% relative to the me-
dian ﬂux in a 0.1 orbital phase (21.4 minute) bin, are seen in the
9 GHz data at an orbital phase around 0.5-0.6. The 5 GHz data
shows a similar strengthening of the pulse fraction at an orbital
phase of ∼0.5. The 1.5 GHz data do not show any evidence for
periodic variation in the folded lightcurves, and the typical 10%
diﬀerence between maximum and minimum in these lightcurves
reﬂects the signal to noise of the data.

variability of AR Sco on short timescales. This includes aperi-
odic ﬂaring, particularly apparent in the 1.5 GHz band, in ad-
dition to the known pulsations of the system. While the ﬂares
seen at 1.5 GHz have not been reported in the optical, they show
timescales of just a few minutes, and it is likely that a similar
(20% of total ﬂux) ﬂare would be masked by the strong beat/spin
modulation in the optical.

In Figure 7 we calculate a Lomb-Scargle periodogram
(Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982; Press & Rybicki 1989) of each
dataset, in order to determine the dominant frequency compo-
nents in the variability. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong compo-
nent at the orbital frequency in each band. There is also a sig-
nal at high frequencies. In Figure 8, we examine this region,
and twice its frequency, in more detail. At both 5 and 9 GHz
we identify signiﬁcant power at a frequency consistent with the
beat period (PB = 118.2 s) between the binary orbit and the

5. Polarization

In addition to total ﬂux measurements (the Stokes I parame-
ter), the VLA data contains full polarization information. Ob-
servations were taken at each frequency of the low-polarization
leakage calibrator J1407+2827 as part of the relevant scheduling
block. These were used to determine the instrumental polariza-
tion, while the known polarization properties of our primary ﬂux
calibrator 3C286 were used to determine the cross-hand delays
and the R-L polarization angle. Standard CASA tasks gaincal
and polcal were used to calculate these, and they were applied
together with the basic gain, delay and ﬂux amplitude calibration
tables generated by the VLA pipeline.

5.1. Polarization with Orbital Phase

5.1.1. 9 GHz band

We ﬁrst explore polarization data at 9 GHz (X band), where the
total ﬂux and beat signal are strongest. In Figure 12 we illustrate
the polarization with orbital phase. Data were initially imaged
by (15 minute) scan in all four Stokes parameters. Once the vari-
ation was identiﬁed in the Stokes V parameter, each scan was
divided into two six minute periods (where an even number of

minutes was chosen to ensure consistent averaging over the beat
period). Note, due to the necessity of phase calibration and the
non-integer number of beat periods per scan, there is an unob-
served interval between each pair of integrations. As before, the
CASA imfit function was used to determine the ﬂux of AR Sco
in each image, and where the ﬁt failed due to the lack of any vis-
ible source, a ﬂux of zero is assigned in that Stokes parameter.
Typical uncertainties are of order 0.2% in the polarization, dom-
inated by the RMS uncertainty in the polarized images, rather
than the total Stokes I ﬂux.

The resultant polarization light curve shows a strong depen-
dence on orbital phase. The linear polarization is consistently
low, with either no detectable source in the Stokes parameter
imaging or a point source detection at < 2 σ over the bulk of the
orbital period. However at orbital phases between -0.05 (0.95)
and 0.2, the linear polarization is consistently above zero (albeit
at low signiﬁcance). The dominant component switches between
Q and U, suggesting a rapid rotation of the linear polarization
(on a timescale of minutes). At its maximum, the source has a
total linear polarization (in a six minute interval) of 1.0 ± 0.3%.
By contrast both the strength and variation of circular polar-
ization (the Stokes V parameter) in AR Sco are more extreme.
For the bulk of the orbital period, the source is consistent with
exhibiting negative (anticlockwise) circular polarization. This

Fig. 9. Beat-folded lightcurves for the radio emission of AR Sco as a
function of frequency. In each band, the data has been phase-folded
by the 118.199 s beat period of the system, and each datum is nor-
malised by a running mean over 450 seconds. Red points show the me-
dian in beat period phase bins of 0.05. Zero beat phase is deﬁned at
T0(beat)=57510.28387390(BMJD), which corresponds to a minimum
at 5 GHz.

quency. We show that the beat pattern is captured in short integrations
at the peak of the orbital lightcurve and at the orbital minimum. Vertical
dotted lines mark intervals of 118.2 s (the beat period), referenced to
the 5 GHz data as in Figure 9. Optical data from W1m are shown with
an arbitrary ﬂux scaling for comparison. In the bottom panel, we indi-
cate the half-amplitude of the phase-folded and binned beat lightcurve
in each orbital phase bin, at 1.5, 5 and 9 GHz.

polarization becomes highly signiﬁcant at an orbital phase of
≈0.95 with V = −5.7 ± 0.2%. It exhibits a secondary (lower sig-
niﬁcance) negative peak with V = −0.23 ± 0.06% at an orbital
phase of ≈0.65.

peaking at V = −7.7±0.3%, at an orbital phase of 0.9, somewhat
earlier than that seen at 9 GHz. The secondary peak, at an orbital
phase of 0.65, is also reproduced and is well-detected, reaching
V = −1.3 ± 0.2%.

5.1.2. 5 GHz band

This behaviour is mirrored in the polarization at 5 GHz (C band),
where we integrate over individual 10 minute scans. As before,
the source is consistent with a very low linear polarization, peak-
ing short of 1% at an orbital phase close to zero. By contrast,
the circular polarization shows a very strong orbital modulation,

5.1.3. 1.5 GHz band

The orbital behaviour of polarization at 1.5 GHz (L band) is far
more extreme than that seen at higher frequencies. Again we in-
tegrate over 10 minute scans, and do not attempt to subdivide
these due to the relatively low total ﬂux signal-to-noise in this

For each band, we show three consecutive beat cycles, extracted near the

the W1m BG and Z bands are simultaneous, and these have an arbitrary

band. The lightcurve at 1.5 GHz spans more than a full orbital
period, giving more indication of the orbit-to-orbit variation. The
linear polarization is in the range 1-3% for the majority of the
orbit, reaching a minimum around an orbital phase of 0.45 and
showing a maximum of ≈ 3%, close to an orbital phase of 1
(slightly after this in the ﬁrst orbit, slightly before in the sec-
ond, but consistent given the random uncertainties on each data
point).

The circular polarization shows a similar excursion to large
negative values to that seen at higher frequencies, but reaching
V = −27 ± 1% in the ﬁrst orbit and V = −22 ± 1% in the sec-
ond orbit. This negative peak appeared earlier at 5 than 9 GHz.
It appears earlier still at 1.5 GHz and is broader, with a signif-
icant negative excursion in polarization between phases of 0.6
and 0.8. This feature also shows internal structure, splitting into
two overlapping negative peaks, rather than being a single nar-
row peak as seen at higher frequencies. The secondary peak seen
at 5 and 9 GHz is also apparent at 1.5 GHz, again shifted earlier
in the orbit.

5.2. Polarization with Beat Phase

5.2.1. 9 GHz band

In optical light, the polarization of AR Sco is known to vary
strongly on the beat and spin periods (Buckley et al. 2017). In
the radio, we lack the signal-to-noise and uv-plane coverage to
resolve the polarization on these two minute periods. Instead
we investigate behaviour using phase folding as before. Indi-
vidual visibility integrations were assigned a beat phase, based
on the 118.2 s beat period and referenced to the same (5 GHz
beat minimum) zero phase as in section 4. The visibilities were
then grouped by this beat phase, and an image created in each
Stokes parameter, including only those visibilities contributing
to a given beat phase bin. This was done for the entire observa-
tion (i.e. a full orbital period) and separately for subsets of the
data covering 20% in orbital phase, centred near the maximum
and minimum of the orbital ﬂux variation. The resulting polar-
ization light curves are shown in Figure 13.

Fig. 12. The dependence of polarization on orbital phase at 1.5 GHz (up-
per panel), 5 GHz (middle panel) and 9 GHz (lower panel). Data were
imaged in all four Stokes parameters in 10, 10 and 6 minute time bins
respectively (i.e. averaging over beat period behaviour). We show the
circular polarization percentage (Stokes V/I) and the total linear po-

terms. An identically zero polarization indicates that imfit was unable
to identify a source at the location of AR Sco in that Stokes parameter.

(cid:112)

As is clear from the ﬁgures, the very low linear polarization
at 9 GHz, in contrast to the 40% polarization seen in the optical,
does not arise entirely from the eﬀects of averaging over the beat
cycle. Splitting the data by beat phase suggests that the linear po-
larization is nearly constant through the beat cycle, at a low level
with no clear dependence on beat phase. There is also no clear
dependence of the linear polarization beat-period lightcurve on
orbital phase. The mean linear polarization in the upper panel of
Figure 13 (i.e. dividing by beat phase for the whole orbital pe-
riod) is 0.16±0.03%. However it is possible that this is averaging
out some of the signal. When the data for the two subsets in the
lower panels of Figure 13 are considered, the mean 9 GHz linear

deﬁned as in ﬁgure 9. This procedure was repeated for two subsets at
orbital phases ≈ 0 and 1. An identically zero polarization indicates that

polarization increases to 0.37±0.04%. This suggests that there
are short intervals with signiﬁcantly higher polarization than the
mean. If the polarization angle varies (i.e. signal is exchanged
between the Stokes Q and U parameters), such short-term po-
larization signals would be washed out in a time-averaged ﬂux.
There is some hint of this happening - while the total linear po-
larization remains broadly constant through the beat period, both
Q and U ﬂuxes vary signiﬁcantly in adjacent phase bins.

By contrast, the 9 GHz circular polarization, shown in Figure
12 to be strongly dependent on orbital phase, also appears to be
sensitive to beat phase. The Stokes V parameter shows negative
ﬂux (i.e. counterclockwise circular polarization in the signal), at

all beat phases when averaging over the orbit, or when consid-
ering the minimum of the Stokes I lightcurve. It is strongest at
a beat phase of 0.5 (where zero marks the minimum total ﬂux),
peaking at V = −4.2 ± 0.3%.

Finally, there is no clear evidence for polarization variation
when folding on the spin (rather than beat) frequency. Reproduc-
ing Figure 13 on the spin period yields near-constant linear po-
larization at the same level (∼ 0.4%), while circular polarization
shows a similar strength and pattern to that folded on the beat
period (i.e. appearing strongest, with V ∼-4%, at the minimum
of the folded light curve).

quency mirrors that at 9 GHz. The linear polarization does not
exceed 1% at any beat phase (when phase-folded) but is typi-
cally non-zero. The circular polarization is again modulated on
the beat-phase, peaking at a beat phase of 0.4-0.5.

larized emission features in the orbital light curve, and the beat-
folded light curve shows no clear evidence for a beat-phase mod-
ulation in 1 GHz data near these phases, albeit with large un-
certainties on individual data points. We also consider the beat-
cycle at orbital phase 0.4 - 0.6 (where the Stokes V ﬂux is large
and negative) in ﬁgure 16. As expected, the circular polarization
is larger than the orbit average, but still shows no clear depen-
dence on beat phase.

5.2.3. 1.5 GHz band

6. Discussion and Interpretation

The results of folding the 1.5 GHz data on the beat period are
shown in Figure 15. These data show less evidence for a beat
period dependence in the polarization. Given the lower signal-
to-noise ratio in the total ﬂux measurements, uncertainties on
the polarization are larger in this band. Both the linear and cir-
cular polarization show near-constant values, at ≈1.5 and −7%
respectively. While there is some variation with beat phase, this
is consistent with the uncertainties on each data point. At this
frequency, orbital phases of 0 and 0.5 both miss signiﬁcant po-

The strong periodic variability of AR Sco in the optical marked
it out as an anomalous source among known white dwarf bina-
ries. Our initial radio observations, obtained with ATCA, demon-
strated that these extended to the radio. However they were too
short to probe the orbital phase behaviour, and too limited by uv-
plane coverage and sensitivity to probe short time-scales at high
signal to noise.

Here we have demonstrated that the GHz radio emission of
AR Sco is in many ways similar to that observed in the opti-

timescales (a matter of seconds) for variation in the radio emis-
sion, suggesting the ﬂaring region is small.

Interestingly these modulations disappear at the lowest fre-
quencies, with the 1.5 GHz data showing no signiﬁcant evidence
for modulation on either the beat or spin frequencies. This hints
that the 1.5 GHz ﬂux may arise from a distinct, non-pulsing
mechanism in AR Sco, as suggested by the double-peaked or-
bital lightcurve and the shallow spectral slope.

The exceptional linear polarization seen in the optical is not
seen at radio frequencies. The linear polarization of AR Sco in
the radio is near constant at < 1%. However, the presence of
well-detected circular polarization implies the presence of mag-
netic ﬁelds aligned along the line of sight, and its modulation on
both the orbital and beat periods requires further consideration.
To ﬁrst order, the ratio between circular and linear polarization is
determined by the Lorentz factor of the emitting electrons, with
strong circular polarization implying non-relativistic, cyclotron
rather than relativistic synchrotron emission.

This emission source appears to be near-constant, with the
beating but unpolarized (in the radio) synchrotron emission su-
perimposed upon it. If so, the polarized emission source likely
has a circular polarization well in excess of the measured 5-10%
seen at 9 GHz and is simply being diluted by the stronger, pulsed
emission. This is supported by the fact that polarization is also
stronger at lower frequencies where the total ﬂux is lower.

Interestingly AR Sco shows very similar orbital phase polar-
ization behaviour to known polars and intermediate polars (IPs)
- a class of White Dwarf-M dwarf binaries with which AR Sco
shares many of its properties. These sources have typical mag-
netic ﬁelds <100 MG (Ferrario et al. 2015), slightly lower than
that inferred for emission regions in AR Sco from optical po-
larization (Buckley et al. 2017), and are often characterised by
cyclotron emission features in the optical. Several known polars,
including VV Puppis (Wickramasinghe & Meggitt 1982), EXO
03319-2554.2 (Ferrario et al. 1989) and MLS110213 (Silva et al.
2015), show optical circular polarization peaking at about 10%
of the total ﬂux. In IPs, polarization is also observed to modu-
late on the white dwarf spin period (e.g. Potter et al. 2012) while
sources typically show linear polarization comparable to circu-
lar, with L/V ∼ 0.2 − 0.6 (Wickramasinghe & Ferrario 2000),
comparable to that in AR Sco (L/V ∼ 0.2 at 5 GHz). In the case
of both polars and IPs, this is interpreted as a cyclotron emis-
sion region arising from single-pole stream-fed accretion onto
the surface of the white dwarf.

In AR Sco, despite the striking similarity in the circularly
polarized lightcurve, and the circular-to-linear polarization ratio,
this model cannot apply in all particulars. There is no sign of
accretion, suggesting that the white dwarf cannot contribute in
the same manner as in IPs. The much weaker variation on the
spin or beat periods, relative to that observed at near-zero orbital
phase, also suggests that the circularly-polarized emission arises
primarily from the M dwarf itself, perhaps from steady accretion
of magnetically-entrained winds onto polar regions of the red
dwarf or from emission in a bow shock region near the surface.
While the white dwarf in AR Sco has a strong magnetic
ﬁeld, the environs of the M dwarf are likely to experience lower
ﬁeld strengths. Their typical surface ﬁelds are in the region of
0.1 to 1kG (although they can be stronger in localised regions)
(e.g. Berger 2006). This is comparable to the estimated strength
of the white dwarf ﬁeld at the M dwarf surface (0.1 kG, Katz
2017). These ﬁeld strengths correspond to non-relativistic cy-
clotron emission frequencies from 0.3 to 3 GHz, which would
place the fundamental emission peak for cyclotron ﬂux from the
M dwarf within, or just below, our observation frequencies. Our

cal. The orbital phase modulation of the total continuum ﬂux is
clearly detected across the full range of observed frequencies (1-
10 GHz), with the orbital modulation exceeding 50% of the peak
ﬂux. The minimum of the radio lightcurve is also at a similar
orbital phase to that observed in the optical, albeit with evidence
for radio frequency-dependent variation in the light curve. This
provides strong evidence that the radio continuum emission orig-
inates from close to the inner face of the M-dwarf, if not from the
stellar surface itself. Key orbital phases for the AR Sco system
are indicated on a phase diagram for clarity in ﬁgure 17.

The radio spectral slope S ν ∝ ν0.35 is comparable to the self-
absorbed synchrotron slope of S ν ∝ ν0.33 derived by Geng et al.
(2016) for the 10-1000 GHz region, from data in Marsh et al.
(2016), but signiﬁcantly shallower than the self-absorbed spec-
tral slope, ν2, they predict for the 1-10 GHz region. Where the
total ﬂux peaks, at orbital phase of 0.5, the spectral index steep-
ens. This may suggest that an additional emission component
is contributing to the continuum emission at low radio frequen-
cies (< 5 GHz), with the strongest eﬀect where the synchrotron
emission spectrum that extends up to the optical is weakest. The
orbital light curves shown in Figure 4 suggest that this low-
frequency emission component peaks twice in the orbital phase,
which may imply a bipolar emission source arising from, or near,
the (tidally-locked) M-dwarf.

The radio data also conﬁrms strong modulation of the total
ﬂux at 5 and 9 GHz on the system beat period and at half this
period, with little signal on the spin period. Again the double-
peaked light curve suggests bipolar emission, this time com-
ing from an interaction between the white dwarf and red dwarf,
consistent with the extant picture of this source as a nearly-
perpendicular rotator, with the white dwarf’s polar magnetic
ﬁelds whipping past the red dwarf twice in each white dwarf
spin period (Marsh et al. 2016). The very erratic ﬂaring and vari-
ation in strength of the signal from pulse to pulse suggests short

radio observations of AR Sco are thus analogous to optical ob-
servations of polars in the sense that the cyclotron frequency of
polars is usually in the near-infrared, so that harmonics of or-
der a few are observed in the optical, while we may be seeing
the equivalent low order cyclotron / gyro-synchrotron emission
from the M dwarf in AR Sco in the radio.

This emission may be most visible when the irradiated face
of the red dwarf (which pulses with strong synchrotron emis-
sion on the beat period) is turned out of the line of sight and no
longer swamps the lower energy cyclotron emission. As well as
the diﬀerent cyclotron emission site (M dwarf, rather than white
dwarf), AR Sco’s broad synchrotron spectrum shows that it is
distinguished from typical polars by the presence of an extended
high energy tail of electrons. These relativistic electrons generate
the higher frequency radio, far infrared, infrared, optical and UV
emission. If this comes from a region with a ∼100 G ﬁeld, this
emission implies electrons with Lorentz factors of order ∼1000,
or energies of order a GeV, so it is true synchrotron (rather than
cyclotron emission) and we should not expect such high circu-
lar polarisation. This high energy tail might act to wash out the
cyclotron hump structure that one might otherwise expect at ra-
dio frequencies if the analogy with optical observations of polars
were exact.

7. Conclusions

We have obtained high time resolution, interferometric radio
spectral imaging and polarization data for AR Sco in the 1.5,
5 and 9 GHz bands, using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array.
Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows:

– The total radio ﬂux from AR Sco exhibits a power law
spectrum between 1 and 10 GHz, with a spectral slope of
0.358 ± 0.015 (ﬁt in the range 4-10 GHz) when ﬂux is inte-
grated over a full orbit.

– The total radio ﬂux is modulated on the 3.56 hr orbital period
of the AR Sco binary system. The strength of this modulation
is a function of frequency, with the strongest changes seen at
9 GHz.

– Emission at 5 and 9 GHz is also modulated on the white
dwarf spin-orbit beat period also identiﬁed in optical data.
Emission at 1.5 GHz shows no apparent beat phase modu-
lation. The fractional pulsation strength decreases with fre-
quency, and is lower in the radio than the optical. The median
beat pulse fraction is ∼20% at 9 GHz.

– AR Sco shows signiﬁcant levels of negative circular polar-
ization in a narrow range of orbital phases. The peak of this
circularly polarized emission shifts to earlier phases with de-
creasing frequency, as the fractional strength of the circularly
polarized ﬂux increases. Circularly polarized emission also
peaks at the minimum of the beat-folded light curve at 5 and
9 GHz.

– The linear polarization of AR Sco is far lower in the radio
than optical, peaking at a few percent at 1.5,GHz, and shows
no clear dependence on beat phase at any frequency.

– Emission at 1-10 GHz likely arises from close to or on the
surface of the M-dwarf, with no clear evidence for emission
from the white dwarf.

– The 1-10 GHz frequency regime appears to mark a transition
between diﬀerent dominant emission regions and mecha-
nisms, likely breaking from the synchrotron power-law emis-
sion that extends up to the optical towards a non-relativistic,
circularly polarized cyclotron emission mechanism at low
frequencies.

In conclusion, the radio observations of AR Sco have re-
vealed a hitherto unseen, non-relativistic electron emission com-
ponent at low radio frequencies. The system nonetheless remains
a challenging source to interpret, and would beneﬁt from further
observations and theoretical study. Simultaneous observations at
multiple frequencies in the radio may be necessary to fully dis-
entangle ﬂaring and orbit-to-orbit variation from frequency de-
pendent shifts in behaviour. This presents signiﬁcant technical
challenges, both in terms of the shortage of arrays with multi-
band receivers, and the diﬃculty of obtaining suﬃcient signal
to noise and support in the uv-plane for the short integrations
required.
