Abstract

We present discharge probability studies performed with a single Thick Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM) irradiated with alpha
particles in Ar-CO2 and Ne-CO2 mixtures. We observe a clear dependency of the discharge stability on the noble gas and quencher
content pointing to lighter gases to be more stable against the development of streamer discharges. A detailed comparison of the
measurements with Geant4 simulations allowed us to extract the critical charge value leading to the formation of a spark in a
THGEM hole, which is found to be within the range of (3–7) ×106 electrons, depending on the gas mixture.

Our experimental ﬁndings are compared to previous GEM results. We show that the discharge probability of THGEMs exceeds
the one measured with GEMs by orders of magnitude. This can be explained with simple geometrical considerations, where
primary ionization is collected by a lower number of holes available in a THGEM structure, reaching higher primary charge
densities and thus increasing the probability of a spark occurrence. However, we show that the critical charge limits are similar for
both ampliﬁcation structures.

1. Introduction

A Thick Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM) [1, 2] is a robust
gaseous ionization detector. Its design is derived from a thinner
GEM [3] structure, with its dimensions expanded by a factor
of 5–20 , and shares the same working principle of avalanche
multiplication within small holes. The larger (sub-)millimeter
structures make THGEMs more robust and it allows for higher
achievable gains than in GEMs, for a mitigation of the damages
caused by discharges, and for the construction of very large
detector areas without mechanical support. The larger dimen-
sions make THGEMs also easier to manufacture. The holes are
produced by mechanical drilling into a metal-clad insulator for
which a variety of PCB materials, like FR-4, Kevlar or Teﬂon,
can be used [4]. Some THGEM variants have the metal around
the holes chemically etched, which creates metal-free rims sur-
rounding the holes. Large rims with a width of O(100 µm) allow
for an order of magnitude higher gains, thus improving stabil-
ity against electrical discharges [4, 5], at the cost of long-term
gain dependence on time and radiation rate [6]. The latter is
marginal when employing THGEMs with a small ((cid:46) 20 µm) or
no rim [6].

The breakdown voltage of a no-rim THGEM structure is
given by the Paschen’s law and reaches ∼2200 V for a 400 µm-
thick structure in air.

borders and defects related to the production procedure [7].
Therefore, a dedicated post-production treatment is necessary
in order to smooth out the hole edges and remove defects or
other imperfections coming from the drilling of the holes. An
eﬀective polishing and cleaning procedure has been proposed
in [7] and implemented successfully in the COMPASS RICH-1
upgrade project [8, 9].

It has been shown, that the breakdown voltage measured
with THGEMs in air could indeed reach Paschen’s limits af-
ter the special surface treatment [10]. The maximum absolute
gain Gmax

therefore depend only on the fundamental critical charge lim-

discharge [11, 12, 13, 14] and a simple relation

where Qcrit is the critical charge at which the avalanche trans-
forms into a streamer and qprim is the primary charge (electrons)
entering an ampliﬁcation structure (here a THGEM hole). The
critical charge values reported for various types of Micro Pat-
tern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) vary between 106 and 107 [15,

value can be associated with a given ampliﬁcation structure.
The critical charge limit depends on the exact geometry of a
structure, the value of qprim or the gas mixture [15, 16, 17, 18,
19]. For the latter, in particular, a clear correlation between dis-
charge probability and (cid:104)Z(cid:105) of the gas is observed [15, 18, 20, 19]
pointing towards intrinsic properties of the working gas (e.g.
transport, ampliﬁcation) on the streamer development. It also

suggests that the number of primary charges entering an am-
pliﬁcation structure (charge density) is the most relevant pa-
rameter limiting the stability of an MPGD structure. This is
well in line with the measurements of the discharge rate depen-
dency on the particle inclination angle [21] or the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld [22]. The charge density hypothesis has been
also successfully employed in the numerical models describing
the discharge probability measured with Micromegas and GEM
detectors (incl. hybrid stacks, employing both structures) fairly
well [23, 24, 19].

In the following study, we investigate the intrinsic stabil-
ity limits of a single-THGEM detector upon irradiation with
alpha particles. The measurements are performed in Ar- and
Ne-based mixtures with diﬀerent CO2 content to study the in-
ﬂuence of the gas mixture on the discharge probability and crit-
ical charge limits. The latter are obtained by comparing the
data to results obtained within a Geant4 simulation framework
developed for our previous studies with GEMs [19]. The mea-
surements also provide a direct comparison between GEMs and
THGEMs and allow us to evaluate the inﬂuence of geometrical
parameters, such as the hole size, the pitch, and the (TH)GEM
thickness, on the stability of a structure and the resulting Qcrit
value. The outcome of these studies is of particular interest for
currently running or planned hadron-blind and photon detec-
tors based on THGEM technology as well as cryogenic appli-
cations.

2. Experimental Setup

2.1. Detector

The experimental setup consists of a single THGEM
mounted between a drift cathode and a readout plane. Figure 1
shows a photo of the THGEM structure used in the measure-
ments and a schematic picture of the setup. The 11.2 × 11.2 cm2
THGEM is produced by Eltos S.p.A. and is divided into three
segments. Each segment measures 11.2 × 3.7 cm2 and is sep-
arated by a 600 µm gap from one another. A 4.6 mm diame-
ter mounting hole is located in the center of the middle seg-
ment. Altogether this translates into a copper coated area of
123.9 cm2. All the three segments, on each side of the THGEM,
are connected and act as single, top and bottom, electrodes.

The THGEM structure follows the design parameters and
production procedure of the COMPASS RICH-1 Upgrade
THGEMs [25]. The THGEM is 470 µm thick including a 35 µm
thick copper layer on each side. The diameter of the holes is
400 µm except for the holes along the outer border of the ac-
tive area, which have a diameter of 500 µm. There is no rim
around the holes and the pitch between the holes is 800 µm.
After production, the THGEM undergoes a dedicated polish-
ing and cleaning treatment in order to minimise the number of
instabilities caused by the imperfections developed in the pro-
duction process.

Following the schematics shown in Fig. 1, the distance be-
tween the THGEM and the readout plane (induction gap) is
set to 2 mm throughout all measurements. The distance be-
tween the drift cathode and the THGEM (drift gap) is varied

holes as well as the central mounting hole and segment boundaries can be seen.

electrodes are read out by a picoamperemeter. The readout plane is connected
to an oscilloscope.

between 13.0 mm and 58 mm. The corresponding distance be-
tween the source and the THGEM (dsource), taking into account
the 1.5 mm-thick drift cathode PCB,
is adjusted between
14.5 mm and 59.5 mm.

The detector is operated with a constant drift ﬁeld (Edrift),
deﬁned by the potentials at the cathode and the THGEM top
electrode, of 400 V cm−1. However, no ﬁeld cage is employed
to allow for ﬂexibility in choosing the drift gap size. The de-
tector is operated with a grounded THGEM bottom electrode
and readout plane resulting in zero induction ﬁeld Eind. A po-
tential diﬀerence ∆VTHGEM across the THGEM is deﬁned by
a potential applied to the top electrode. An additional 10 MΩ
protection resistor is connected in series between the top and the
power supply to limit the current ﬂow in case of a discharge.

Discharge signals are induced on the readout plane con-
nected to the oscilloscope, which records and counts wave-
forms. Currents induced on the THGEM electrodes and the
drift cathode are measured with a multi-channel picoampereme-
ter (pA-meter) [26], with a 1 kHz sampling frequency and a

2

1 Hz readout rate and are used to determine the absolute gain
of the THGEM (see more details in Section 2.4). The pA-meter
channels used to measure currents induced on THGEM elec-
trodes are equipped with 100 kΩ resistors connected in series
with the input, which can be neglected due to the large value of
the protection resistor. The THGEM, drift cathode, and readout
plane are mounted inside a gas-tight vessel, which is ﬂushed
with one of the three gas mixtures used in the measurements, as
discussed in the next section.

2.2. Gas mixtures

The diﬀerent gas mixtures used in the measurements are Ar-
CO2 (70-30), Ar-CO2 (90-10) and Ne-CO2 (90-10). The gas
properties, electron drift velocity (vd), longitudinal and trans-
verse diﬀusion coeﬃcients (DL and DT, respectively), and ef-

2.3. Radioactive Source

(cid:31)

A mixed alpha source containing 239Pu, 241Am and 244Cm
[30] is placed on top of the cathode to irradiate the drift vol-
7 mm matching the
ume. The source has an active area of
7 mm hole in the 1.5 mm thick drift cathode PCB. The source
emits alpha particles of several energies and intensities, with
(cid:31)
their weighted mean of 5.15 MeV, 5.45 MeV and 5.80 MeV for
239Pu, 241Am and 244Cm, respectively. The source rate mea-
sured by the detector is (358 ± 3) Hz. Figure 2 shows the spe-
ciﬁc energy loss of the alpha particles as a function of their
track length (Ltrack), evaluated in diﬀerent gas mixtures using
the Geant4 simulation framework [31]. The approximate value
of the maximum range of an alpha particle from the source in
a given gas mixture is 42 mm in Ar-CO2 (70-30), 48 mm in Ar-
CO2 (90-10), and 70 mm in Ne-CO2 (90-10).

2.4. Absolute gain determination
2.4.1. Deﬁnition

All measurements of the discharge probability are performed
as a function of the absolute gain (Gabs) given by the ratio of
the ampliﬁcation current measured at the bottom electrode of
the THGEM (Iamp) and the primary ionization current. With
Eind = 0 all electrons coming from the ampliﬁcation region are

collected at the bottom side of the THGEM. Thus, the current
induced at this electrode corresponds to the total ampliﬁcation
current.

The primary ionization current stems from the electrons cre-
ated in the drift volume by the radiation source and reaching the
THGEM. It is measured at the top THGEM electrode with the
bottom electrode and readout plane grounded, ∆VGEM = 0, and
Edrift = 400 V cm−1. The measured values range between 3 pA
and 15 pA, depending on the drift gap size.

2.4.2. Collection eﬃciency

For the absolute gain determination, a collection eﬃciency
of 100% is assumed for the primary electrons from the drift
region entering the THGEM holes.
In order to validate this
assumption, the electron collection eﬃciency of the THGEM is
measured as a function of a drift ﬁeld and is shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 3: Collection eﬃciency of a THGEM evaluated as the ampliﬁcation
current measured as a function of the drift ﬁeld, normalised to its maximum
value. The measurement is performed with 3 mm drift gap for two ∆VTHGEM
values.

while keeping ∆VTHGEM constant and normalizing to the max-
imum measured Iamp value, where a collection eﬃciency of
100% can be reliably assumed [33]. The plateau region spans
for Edrift values between ∼300 V cm−1 and ∼1000 V cm−1. In
this region, all electric ﬁeld lines from the cathode enter the
THGEM holes. A drop for the lowest ﬁelds can be associ-
ated with electron attachment to the residual traces of water
and oxygen present in the gas mixture (see Section 2.2). Also,
a slight gain dependence on the drift ﬁeld is expected, as the
latter inﬂuences the ﬁeld inside a hole. For higher Edrift val-
ues the collection eﬃciency drops as more electric ﬁeld lines
originating from the drift cathode ends on the top electrode of
the THGEM. It is thus safe to assume full collection of primary
charges while operating the detector with Edrift = 400 V cm−1.
This is in line with the well established transparency measure-
ments of GEMs [33, 34].

2.4.3. Charging-up eﬀects

In THGEMs the charge-up of dielectric material introduces
a time-dependent gain variation which can be split into a short-
term and a long-term component [6]. The measurement times in
this study, between several minutes and maximum three hours,
are too short to see an impact of the long-term part, related to
the movement of charges within the PCB ﬁbreglass plates [6],
which usually takes many hours up to a full day. The short-term
eﬀects, taking place in the ﬁrst minutes of operation, are, on
the other hand, caused by charges accumulating on the insula-
tor surface due to the lateral diﬀusion of the avalanche charge.
These charges create an electric ﬁeld opposite to the external
ﬁeld and thus reduce the gain [35, 36]. This eﬀect increases
with the thickness of the PCB material and with the size of
the rims. Moreover, experimental conditions unrelated to the
THGEM, e.g. humidity or impurities in the gas, may inﬂuence
the stabilization time.

The short-term charging-up eﬀects are taken into account in
the absolute gain measurements performed in this study. Since
the time necessary to reach equilibrium (teq) depends on the
total charge that passes through a THGEM hole, an inverse
proportionality to the detector gain can be observed [35]. The
teq values measured with the THGEM used in this study reach
∼75 min for the lowest gains Gabs ≈ 10. However, already at
a gain of 20, the teq drops to ∼25 min. For absolute gains in
the region of interest (Gabs > 100) the evaluation of gain and
corresponding discharge probability measurement starts always
∼20 min after ramping up voltages to the appropriate ∆VTHGEM
and Edrift values.

It was also observed that the primary current value, mea-
sured prior to each measurement session (deﬁned by the gas
mixture and dsource), reaches its asymptotic value within 15–
20 min. The eﬀect, related to the initial charge-up of the in-
sulating THGEM surfaces, is accounted for by measuring the
primary current value at least 20 min after applying the nomi-
nal drift ﬁeld.

2.4.4. Gain measurement

Figure 4 shows the absolute gain as a function of ∆VTHGEM
for diﬀerent gas mixtures and distances between the source and
THGEM surface. Gains obtained in Ne-CO2 (90-10) are the
highest due to the larger Townsend coeﬃcients for neon- than
argon-based mixtures. The scaling of gain between two argon-
based mixtures follows the amount of quencher.

The gain is evaluated for each discharge probability mea-
surement, averaging the Iamp over the full measurement time.
For ∆VTHGEM above the discharge onset, current spikes associ-
ated with sparks need to be accounted for. Discharges in the
THGEM lead to temporarily higher currents on both electrodes
which may introduce a bias towards higher absolute gains. To
exclude such bias, the averaging algorithm does not include am-
pliﬁcation current values measured during the spark-associated
current spike deﬁned as a variance of ≥ 5 σ over the Iamp mov-
ing mean value, where σ is the standard deviation of the latter.
One measurement point after a current spike is excluded from
the average, in addition. Figure 5 shows an example of the am-
pliﬁcation current measurement together with two spikes iden-
tiﬁed and excluded from the average. In order to make the gain
evaluation feasible, the average discharge rates do not exceed
0.25 Hz throughout all measurements.

For moderate gain values the exponential dependency on
the applied voltage is observed, as expected. However, a devi-
ation from the exponential behaviour for the highest gains can
be noticed. The onset of this deviation coincides with the ﬁrst
occurrence of discharges in a measurement. This could be pos-
sibly explained by a change in the polarization of the PCB ma-
terial, or a similar eﬀect, which inﬂuences the electric ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration inside the holes. It should be noted, that the absolute
gain, inﬂuenced by the occurrence of ﬁrst discharges, does not
reach the value expected from the extrapolation of the exponen-
tial function ﬁtted in the undisturbed range even several minutes
after a discharge. This observation was conﬁrmed with low dis-
charge rate measurements, where the time between subsequent
discharges exceeded the characteristic time teq of charging-up
eﬀects. This suggests that the eﬀect is not related to the charges
collected on the insulating layer. The inﬂuence of the spark-
related current spikes on the ampliﬁcation current can also be
ruled out as they are excluded from the Iamp measurement, as
explained in the previous paragraph. Thus, it is ensured that the
Gabs value measured in this region is the actual absolute gain
value. Due to this behaviour, an extrapolation of the absolute
gain is not possible and it is necessary to measure the absolute
gain for each point the discharge probability is evaluated.

2.5. Discharge probability measurement

A typical discharge signal is shown in Fig. 6. The discharge
probability Pdis is deﬁned as the number of recorded discharge
signals Ndis normalised to the total number of alpha particles
emitted from the alpha source towards the THGEM structure,
given by the alpha particle rate Rα (see Section 2.3) and the
measurement time tmeas, following the ratio

Pdis = Ndis/(Rα · tmeas).

Figure 5: Ampliﬁcation current measured at the bottom THGEM electrode.
Two spikes correspond to spark occurrences. An averaging algorithm excludes
red points from the mean current value calculated for the gain estimate (see text
for more details).

All discharge signals are recorded by a high-performance
oscilloscope able to record > 1 kHz waveforms with 100% ef-
ﬁciency, which are then counted and analysed to resolve pos-
sible ambiguities. Depending on the gain settings, between a
few and several hundreds discharge signals are recorded in a
single discharge probability measurement. Thus, the statistical
uncertainty of the discharge probability, calculated assuming
spark occurrence undergoing a Poisson distribution, exceeds

3% for all measurements. With the maximum discharge rate
of ∼0.25 Hz (see Section 2.4.4) the average time between dis-
charges is considerably longer than the system dead-time of
∼40 ms needed to re-establish the nominal ∆VTHGEM value in
the THGEM after a spark. This time depends on the capac-
itance of the THGEM structure and HV cables (∼0.8 nF), and
the 10 MΩ protection resistor used in the setup (see Fig. 1). The
occurrence probability of a discharge within the detector dead-
time, given by the Poisson distribution, is therefore (cid:28)1% for
the highest discharge rates. As the statistical uncertainties of

the latter can be considered negligible in the evaluation of Pdis.

3. Results

Figure 7 shows the discharge probability measured as a func-
tion of the absolute gain of an ampliﬁcation structure at diﬀer-
ent dsource values. The results for the THGEM are presented
with full points for all gases used in this study.

3.1. (cid:104)Z(cid:105) dependence

It can be clearly seen that the discharge probability strongly
depends on the gas mixture. The diﬀerences are especially pro-
nounced between argon and neon mixtures. For a given gain,
the discharge probability in Ar-CO2 (90-10) and Ar-CO2 (70-
30) is several orders of magnitude larger than in Ne-CO2 (90-
10). This can be explained considering the basic properties of
the corresponding noble gas (see Table 1). The eﬀective ioniza-
tion potential Wi is lower in argon-based mixtures than in neon,
thus the number of primary electrons liberated by an incident
particle is higher. In addition, as discussed in Section 2.2, the
range of alpha particles in the Ar-based mixtures is up to 40%
shorter than in Ne-CO2 (90-10). As a result, higher charge den-
sities are obtained in argon, therefore it is more likely to exceed
the critical charge limits and develop a streamer in this gas. The
same (cid:104)Z(cid:105)-dependency was observed in studies with GEMs [19]
indicated in Fig. 7 with hollow points.

3.2. dsource dependence

The THGEM results provide further arguments towards the
primary charge density hypothesis being the driving factor for
discharge formation in GEM-like structures. The measured dis-
charge probability increases signiﬁcantly with dsource values close
to the maximum range of an alpha particle in a given gas mix-
ture. At such distances it is more likely that the Bragg peak
produced by an alpha particle track is located in close vicinity
of a THGEM hole, depositing a large amount of energy, which
leads to high values of charge density. In addition, the discharge
probability drops abruptly for values of dsource larger than the
alpha range, when no primary electrons are liberated within
the THGEM holes (or close to them). The charges, drifting
towards the THGEM plane, undergo diﬀusion which reduces
charge densities at the hole level thus reducing the discharge
probability. Since the maximum track length of an alpha parti-
cle is about 20 mm shorter in any of the Ar-based mixtures used
in this study than in Ne-CO2 (90-10), no discharge curves could
be obtained in the former within a reasonable time for the two
largest distances of 51.2 mm and 59.5 mm.

3.3. Quencher content dependence

An interesting observation can be made by looking at the re-
sults obtained with Ar-based mixtures with diﬀerent CO2 con-
tent. Even though higher quencher content is usually associated
with increased stability, discharge probability values measured
in Ar-CO2 (90-10) are lower than in Ar-CO2 (70-30) until inver-
sion at dsource = 39.5 mm. The same order of discharge curves

6

at this distance was measured with GEMs in [19], however, no
data for Ar-CO2 (70-30) is available for lower dsource values.
This observation could be again explained with primary charge
densities and larger values of diﬀusion coeﬃcient in the less
quenched mixture (see Section 2.2 and 2.3). As shown in Fig. 2,
the average energy loss of alpha particles in Ar-CO2 (90-10)
exceeds values obtained in Ar-CO2 (70-30) for track lengths
larger than ∼40 mm, which corresponds to the dsource value at
which the inversion is observed.

3.4. Comparison between THGEM and GEM

The discharge probability values obtained with a THGEM
substantially exceed those measured at the same absolute gain
with a GEM of standard design [19]. The latter features a 50 µm
thick polyimide foil covered on both sides with 5 µm layers of
copper, with 50 µm (70 µm) inner (outer) hole diameter and a
pitch of 140 µm.

For the same value of discharge probability measured in
a given gas mixture, the absolute gain value diﬀers between
GEMs and THGEMs by a factor of 2–5. With 100% collection
eﬃciency and almost six times larger pitch between THGEM
holes, it is clear that when fewer holes are available more pri-
mary charges can be collected in a single ampliﬁcation cell.
Thus, the number of primary charges entering a THGEM hole
is larger than the corresponding number for GEMs. As pri-
mary charges are liberated along the straight alpha tracks, the
portion of primary charges entering each hole should approx-
imately scale with the hole pitch. This would explain the ob-
served diﬀerences between Gmax
abs obtained with both structures.
With this argumentation, following Eq. (1), it can be concluded
that a similar value of critical charge can be assumed for both
structures.

The exact number of primary charges to be considered, how-
ever, depends on the position of the alpha track relative to the
holes and its inclination. In order to study all possible geometri-
cal eﬀects and the inﬂuence of the basic parameters of the used
gas mixture, dedicated Monte Carlo simulations are performed
aiming at reproducing the experimental data, as described in the
following Section 4.

4. Simulation

4.1. Detector Model

In order to study the energy deposition of the alpha parti-
cles in the detector medium, a Geant4 (4.10.2.p02) [31] simu-
lation is used. The simulation framework is based on previous
work on discharge studies with GEMs, and is described in detail
in [19].

In a realistic model of the detector geometry, the exact po-
sition and energy deposit of each individual Geant hit are reg-
istered. The number of primary ionization electrons is then ob-
tained by dividing the energy deposit of each hit by the eﬀec-
tive ionization energy. The electrons drift towards the THGEM
plane according to the gas transport parameters listed in Table 1.
Electrons located within a distance tintvdrift above the THGEM
plane, with charge integration time tint being a free parameter,

Figure 7: Discharge probability as a function of absolute gain measured for a THGEM (full points) and a GEM (hollow points, taken from [19]) for diﬀerent dsource
values.

are then sorted in the honeycomb-like grid of the THGEM holes
assuming 100% collection eﬃciency. In this way, distributions
of electrons collected inside individual THGEM holes, speciﬁc
to the gas mixture, dsource, and tint, are obtained.

The total charge inside a hole is calculated by multiplying
the collected primary electrons by the absolute gain Gabs value.
The formation process of the discharge and its dependence on
the charge density within the THGEM hole is not implemented
in the simulation framework. Instead, a ﬁxed threshold of accu-
mulated charges Qcrit is introduced as a free parameter. A dis-
charge is then deﬁned as an event in which this critical charge
limit Qcrit is exceeded in one of the THGEM holes. The ﬁ-
nal discharge probability is given by the number of events in
which this threshold is exceeded, normalized to the total num-
ber of simulated alpha events. Only one discharge per event
may occur following the experimental conditions where, after a
spark, the potential across the THGEM holes breaks down and
prevents the creation of further discharges. To enable ﬁtting
to experimental data, simulations are performed for a range of
values for Gabs, tint and Qcrit.

Due to the lack of drift ﬁeld deﬁning elements present in
the detector the electric ﬁeld within the active volume is dis-
torted, in particular for larger dsource values. Distortions of the
drift ﬁeld are reﬂected in modiﬁcations of the drift velocity, and
would demand for a more sophisticated treatment of tint. How-
ever, following our previous studies, for the integration time of

interest the variations of the drift ﬁeld are well below 1%, and
can be neglected [19, 32].

Finite element calculations using Comsol® Multiphysics [37]
speciﬁc to the present THGEM setup show that additional ﬁeld
distortions are introduced by the THGEM through the central
mounting hole. The drift ﬁeld around it is distorted in a ra-
dius of 5 mm, therefore charges entering this region do not con-
tribute to the ampliﬁcation and are disregarded in the simula-
tion.

4.2. Comparison to Experimental Data

Simulated discharge curves, obtained for given parameter
pairs (tint, Qcrit), are ﬁtted to the experimental data by means
of χ2 function minimization for each dsource and gas mixture
conﬁguration. tint is constrained to values between 2 and 350 ns,
whereas Qcrit is varied between 5×105 and 15×106. For Qcrit a
step size of 5×105 is used, while tint is varied in steps of 2 ns
within the range of 2–200 ns, in steps of 5 ns in the range of
200–300 ns and in steps of 10 ns in the range of 300–350 ns.
The ampliﬁcation factor has been varied in steps of 25 within
the range of 25–1000 , in steps of 50 in the range of 1000–1500 ,
and in steps of 250 in the range of 1500–2000 . Simulation
ﬁts to the experimental data are shown in Fig. 8. The model
describes the results fairly well.

The distribution of the primary electrons for a given gas is
strongly dependent on tint and dsource. Thus Qcrit has to be ex-
tracted individually for each dsource value. From the summed χ2

values the best parameter pair is extracted for each ﬁt. As the
distribution of primary charges collected within the THGEM
structure is diﬀerent for each dsource and gas mixture, one can-
not extract a single tint value describing all measurements for a
given gas. However, following the simulation steps described
in Section 4.1, it is meaningful to extract a single Qcrit value
associated to the probability of a discharge development in a
given gas, independently of the distance dsource. Therefore, the
Qcrit values obtained for all ﬁts, for a given gas mixture, are
averaged using a weighted mean method. Weights of Qcrit pa-
rameters are given by w = 1/χ2 extracted from each ﬁt. The
results, including the range of the tint values from the individual
ﬁts, are summarised in Table 2.

sulting weighted mean average of critical charge parameter ob-
tained from all ﬁts, for a given gas mixture. Standard deviation
values indicate the spread of Qcrit,i extracted from individual
ﬁts. Although the (cid:104)Qcrit(cid:105) uncertainties are relatively large, a
clear gas dependence can be observed, similar to the results ob-
tained with GEMs1 [19], conﬁrming the hypothesis that no uni-
versal Qcrit value can be associated with a given ampliﬁcation
structure.

The numerical Qcrit results for both ampliﬁcation structures
nicely agree with each other, in spite of the geometrical diﬀer-
ences. Both measurements support the conclusion that the pri-
mary charge density, arriving at the single ampliﬁcation cell, is
a key factor inﬂuencing the stability of a (TH)GEM-like struc-
ture against a spark discharge.

The interpretation of the tint parameter ﬁts is not straight-
forward. Following the model description in Section 4.1 and

1note, the Qcrit values for GEMs were extracted in a two-step χ2 minimiza-

tion process

THGEMAlthough a THGEM hole is an order of magnitude larger in
each direction than its GEM equivalent, the extracted Qcrit lim-
its are the same for both. The primary charge limits shall be
therefore considered per single holes and not normalised to the
hole volume. This would support the conclusion that the eﬀec-
tive volume of streamer formation is similar in both cases.

Given the results described above, one can also derive sev-
eral possible mitigation methods to be considered while design-
ing any kind of (TH)GEM-like structures:

• optimization of the (TH)GEM geometry by reducing the
pitch between holes; this needs to be balanced with the
production capabilities and quality of small-pitch GEMs;

• choice of the gas mixture:

light gases preferable; care
should be taken while choosing the quencher content to
optimise primary charge density and electron transport
properties;

• optimization of ﬁelds above the (TH)GEM structure: if
allowed by the measurement requirements, the minimum
diﬀusion coeﬃcient and maximum drift velocity regions
shall be avoided. Electron collection and extraction ef-
ﬁciencies shall be also considered as they directly inﬂu-
ence the total number of charges entering single
(TH)GEM holes.

preted purely as a development time of a discharge. However,
the order of magnitude of 10–100 ns resembles this of streamer
development in a GEM hole [39]. Thus, larger values of tint ex-
tracted for THGEMs than for GEMs (see Table 2) may partially
be related to the thickness of the former.

5. Conclusions

We have performed systematic measurements of the dis-
charge probability in a single THGEM structure irradiated with
highly ionizing alpha particles and compared them with geo-
metrical model calculations. Both measurements and simula-
tions are performed in the same fashion and using the same
tools as in our previous work on GEM discharge stability [19].
This allows for a direct comparison of these two structures.

The atomic number dependency was observed in both GEM
and THGEM studies pointing to Ne-based mixtures as less
prone to electrical discharges than the argon ones. In addition, it
was shown that increased quencher content does not necessarily
improve detector stability against a spark discharge. Discharge
probabilities measured in Ar-CO2 (70-30) are, in most of the
cases, higher than in Ar-CO2 (90-10), which can be explained
with higher charge densities obtained in the former. For dis-
tances between the radiation source and the THGEM surface
close to the maximum alpha range in Ar-CO2 (70-30), a drop in
discharge probability can be observed, causing an inversion of
discharge curves. In this case, the stability in Ar-CO2 (70-30)
surpasses the one in Ar-CO2 (90-10). Increasing the distance
further to the values exceeding the alpha range, the discharge
probability drops by several orders of magnitude, close to the
background level, as even the highest primary charge densities
obtained around the Bragg peak will be reduced during the elec-
tron drift towards the ampliﬁcation structure.

The THGEM, with its large dimensions, provides also a
great opportunity to study whether the discharge probability
scales with the number of holes available for ampliﬁcation. In-
deed, it has been observed that for the same value of discharge
probability, the absolute gain value diﬀers between GEMs and
THGEMs up to a factor of ﬁve and it can be concluded that the
number of primary charges entering a THGEM hole is higher
than for GEMs. This is not surprising, given the almost six
times larger pitch between THGEM holes. Simulation results
have been ﬁtted to the experimental data and the value of the
Qcrit parameter has been extracted for all the gas mixtures used
in the measurement (see Table 2). The results for both ampli-
ﬁcation structures nicely agree with each other, in spite of the
geometrical diﬀerences. They also conﬁrm the observation of
gas-dependency of the Qcrit value. Both measurements support
the conclusion that the primary charge density, arriving at the
single ampliﬁcation cell, is a key factor inﬂuencing the stability
of a GEM-like structure against a spark discharge.

The results of this work provide enough arguments to claim
that diﬀerent dimensions of GEM and THGEM holes play a
negligible role in the deﬁnition of their critical charge limits.
