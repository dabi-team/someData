Abstract

The structural property of the magnetic ﬁeld in ﬂare-bearing solar active regions (ARs) is one of the key aspects for
understanding and forecasting solar ﬂares. In this paper, we make a comparative analysis on the chirality and magnetic
conﬁgurations associated with two X-class two-ribbon ﬂares happening in AR 10930 and AR 11158. The photospheric
magnetic ﬁelds of the two ARs were observed by space-based instruments, and the corresponding coronal magnetic
ﬁelds were calculated based on the nonlinear force-free ﬁeld model. The analysis shows that the electric current in
the two ARs was distributed mostly around the main polarity inversion lines (PILs) where the ﬂares happened, and
the magnetic chirality (indicated by the signs of force-free factor α) along the main PILs is opposite for the two ARs,
i.e., left-handed (α < 0) for AR 10930 and right-handed (α > 0) for AR 11158. It is found that, for both the ﬂare
events, a prominent magnetic connectivity (featured by co-localized strong α and strong current density distributions)
was formed along the main PIL before ﬂare and was totally broken after ﬂare eruption. The two branches of the
broken magnetic connectivity, combined with the prominent magnetic connectivity before ﬂare, compose the opposite
magnetic conﬁgurations in the two ARs owing to their opposite chirality, i.e., Z-shaped conﬁguration in AR 10930
with left-handed chirality and inverse Z-shaped conﬁguration in AR 11158 with right-handed chirality. It is speculated
that two-ribbon ﬂares can be generally classiﬁed to these two magnetic conﬁgurations by chirality in the ﬂare source
regions of ARs.

1. Introduction

Solar ﬂare is a signiﬁcant eruptive phenomenon observed in the solar atmosphere, which manifests as sudden
enhancement across a broad band of electromagnetic wave spectrum (e.g., optical emission in photosphere and chro-
mosphere, and soft X-ray emission in corona). It is believed to be the result of magnetic energy release in corona
through the process of magnetic reconnection (Priest and Forbes, 2002; Fletcher et al., 2011; Hudson, 2011; Shibata
and Magara, 2011; Benz, 2017). A typical major solar ﬂare event is usually accompanied with coronal mass ejection
(CME) (Forbes, 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Zhang and Low, 2005; Chen, 2011; Webb and Howard, 2012; Gopalswamy,
2016). Beneath the erupting plasmas is the ﬂaring arcade. At the footpoints of the ﬂaring arcade, two bright ﬂare rib-
bons can be seen in chromospheric images observed via chromospheric spectral lines such as Hα, Ca ii H&K, etc.
This sort of typical solar ﬂare events presenting two ﬂare ribbons are also referred to as two-ribbon ﬂares (see example
images in Figure 1).

Big ﬂares and associated CMEs can cause drastic disturbances to the solar-terrestrial and heliospheric space
weather conditions (e.g., Schwenn, 2006; Pulkkinen, 2007; Le et al., 2011; Gurnett et al., 2013; He et al., 2016;
Gurnett and Kurth, 2019; Feng et al., 2020) and impact the safety of spacecrafts as well as the human society on
the Earth (e.g., Pulkkinen, 2007; Lanzerotti, 2017). Similar phenomenon of ﬂare activity was also discovered on the
solar-type stars other than the Sun (e.g., Schaefer et al., 2000; Maehara et al., 2012; Notsu et al., 2013; Shibayama
et al., 2013; Balona, 2015; Davenport, 2016). Understanding the physics of solar ﬂares will help to improve the
predictions of severe space weather events (e.g., Schwenn, 2006; Koskinen et al., 2017), and will also be helpful for
investigating the process of stellar activities (e.g., Benz and G¨udel, 2010; Shibata and Magara, 2011; Aulanier et al.,
2013; Broomhall, 2017; Choudhuri, 2017; Egeland, 2018; McLaughlin et al., 2018).

Solar ﬂares are usually observed in solar active regions (ARs) which are sunspot complexes, and the existence
of sunspots indicates the strong and concentrated magnetic ﬁelds within solar ARs. The structural property of the
magnetic ﬁeld in ﬂare-bearing ARs is one key aspect for understanding the physical processes of solar ﬂares and other
related eruptive phenomena in the solar atmosphere (e.g., Chen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012; He et al., 2014; Kors´os
et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017; Hao et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Inoue et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2019). The
nonpotential property of the magnetic ﬁelds with electric current permeating inside is believed to be the key aspect
related to the activity level of ARs (e.g., Wang et al., 1996; Leka and Barnes, 2003; Schrijver, 2016).

In the standard model of solar ﬂares (also known as CSHKP model; see e.g., Shibata and Magara 2011, and
references therein), ﬂare eruption occurs above the polarity inversion line (PIL) of a solar AR, which separates the
adjacent positive polarity and negative polarity of the magnetic ﬁeld in photosphere. The ﬂaring arcade stretches just
over the PIL, and the footpoints of the ﬂaring arcade (as well as the two ﬂare ribbons in chromosphere) are located
on the two sides of the PIL. Hence the evolution of the magnetic structures around the PIL are closely related to the
ﬂare initiation/eruption processes (e.g., Zirin and Wang, 1993), and the nonpotential characteristics of magnetic ﬁeld
in a solar AR were often analyzed in the vicinity of the PIL, such as through the magnetic shear in photosphere (e.g.,
Wang et al., 1996; Leka and Barnes, 2003) and the twist of ﬁeld lines in corona (e.g., Schrijver, 2016). Janvier et al.
(2014, 2013) and Aulanier et al. (2012, 2013) extended the classic standard model of solar ﬂares and proposed a three-
dimensional (3D) solar ﬂare model. Based on the 3D ﬂare model, they analyzed the strong-to-weak shear transition
in post-ﬂare loops (Aulanier et al., 2012), the upper limit on ﬂare energy (Aulanier et al., 2013), the reconnection
properties of ﬂares (Janvier et al., 2013), and the time-evolution of the geometry of photospheric electric currents
during the ﬂare eruption (Janvier et al., 2014). D´emoulin et al. (1996) used the concept of quasi-separatrix layers
(QSLs; Priest and D´emoulin, 1995) to explore the magnetic conﬁgurations of solar ﬂares. They showed that at the
locations deﬁned by the QSL method, concentrated electric current build-up can be induced by smooth photospheric
motions. As the current density increases, rapid energy release of ﬂares via reconnection can start; but the precise
mechanism of this process has yet to be found (D´emoulin et al., 1996).

These kinds of studies for investigating the relationship between magnetic structures and ﬂare eruptions require
full 3D data of the magnetic ﬁeld in the solar atmosphere. Currently, only the vector magnetic ﬁeld at the photosphere
level of ARs can be measured with high precision and high resolution, especially by the space-based facilities such as
the Hinode satellite (Kosugi et al., 2007) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite (Pesnell et al., 2012).
For the magnetic ﬁeld in corona, one has to rely on the physical modeling and numerical computation to obtain the
magnetic ﬁeld distributions in 3D space, in which the observed photospheric magnetic ﬁeld data are utilized as the
bottom boundary condition (e.g., Sakurai, 1989). The sophisticated and commonly used physical model for calculating
the 3D coronal magnetic ﬁeld distributions is the nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) model (e.g., Wiegelmann and
Sakurai, 2012; R´egnier, 2013), which well represents the physical state of steady corona (e.g., Aschwanden, 2005).

In NLFFF model for corona, magnetic force dominates and other forces are omitted. The magnetic ﬁeld vector
B satisﬁes ∇ × B = αB and ∇α · B = 0, where the parameter α is a scalar function of spatial position and is called
force-free factor (Wiegelmann and Sakurai, 2012; R´egnier, 2013). The equation ∇ × B = αB means that the direction
of the electric current density

j = 1
4π
is parallel (α > 0) or anti-parallel (α < 0) to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld B, i.e.,

∇ × B (in electromagnetic cgs units)

(1)

(2)

j = (α/4π)B,

2

and hence the corona system is in equilibrium because the Lorentz force

f = j × B

(3)

in this situation is zero (so called force-free). The equation ∇α · B = 0 means that the value of α is invariant along
one individual ﬁeld line, which is a particular property of the NLFFF and can be utilized for analyzing the magnetic
connectivity in corona (e.g., He et al., 2014).

Since the NLFFF model is built on the steady condition of corona, the dynamic process of ﬂare eruption cannot be
simulated by the NLFFF model directly. However, before and after ﬂare eruption, the corona is in quasi-equilibrium
states and can be well approximated by the NLFFF model (Sakurai, 1989; Wiegelmann and Sakurai, 2012; R´egnier,
2013). By investigating the variation of the coronal magnetic ﬁelds before and after ﬂare eruption, the changes of the
internal coronal magnetic structures concerning the eruption process of ﬂares can be revealed (e.g., Schrijver et al.,
2008; Inoue et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012; He et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2016). Compared with the compact or complex
solar ﬂare events, the two-ribbon ﬂares have the advantages of adequate spatial scale and purity in morphology, and
thus is preferable for this sort of study.

In previous work, He et al. (2014) calculated the time-series of coronal magnetic ﬁelds based on the NLFFF
model for a notable active region, AR 10930, before and after the X3.4-class two-ribbon ﬂare event happening on
2006 December 13, and investigated the magnetic conﬁguration associated with the ﬂare by analyzing the spatial
distribution variations of the electric current density j and the force-free factor α before and after the ﬂare eruption.
They found that, for the X3.4 ﬂare of AR 10930, a prominent magnetic connectivity (featured by the co-localized
strong negative α and strong current density distributions) was formed along the main PIL of the AR before the ﬂare
and was totally broken after the ﬂare eruption, and the two branches of the broken magnetic connectivity, combined
with the isolated electric current at the magnetic connectivity breaking site (left over from the strong electric current
associated with the prominent magnetic connectivity formed before the ﬂare), compose a Z-shaped conﬁguration.
In this work, we make a comparative analysis between the magnetic conﬁgurations associated with the X3.4 ﬂare
event in AR 10930 and the X2.2 two-ribbon ﬂare event happening on 2011 February 15 in another notable active
region, AR 11158. We are interested in the comparison on the magnetic conﬁgurations of the two ﬂares because the
magnetic ﬁelds in the corresponding ARs (i.e., AR 10930 and AR 11158) have opposite chiral characteristics in the
ﬂare source regions around the main PILs. In short, the magnetic chirality around the main PIL is left-handed for AR
10930 and right-handed for AR 11158 (see the detailed analysis and diagram illustration in Section 4). In literature,
the chirality of solar magnetic features were often discussed in the context of chromospheric ﬁlaments (e.g., Martin,
1998), magnetic helicity (e.g., Rust and Kumar, 1994; Pevtsov, 2005; Pevtsov et al., 2014), and sigmoids of coronal
loops (e.g., Canﬁeld et al., 1999, 2007). In this work, we want to know what the discrepancies of the ﬂare magnetic
conﬁgurations are in ﬂare source regions with opposite magnetic chirality.

In Section 2, we summarize the basic information of the two major two-ribbon solar ﬂare events in AR 10930
and AR 11158. In Section 3, we display the preﬂare and postﬂare photospheric vector magnetograms of the two
ARs as well as the corresponding coronal magnetic ﬁelds calculated based on the NLFFF model. Then the magnetic
nonpotentiality in the two ARs are discussed on the basis of the derived coronal magnetic ﬁeld data. In Section 4, we
explore the chiral characteristics of the magnetic ﬁelds in the ﬂare source regions of the two ARs. In Section 5, we
investigate and compare the magnetic conﬁgurations associated with the two ﬂare events. More discussions on the
magnetic conﬁgurations associated with the two-ribbon ﬂares are given in Sections 6. Section 7 is the conclusion.

2. Two major solar ﬂare events

Two major solar ﬂare events are employed for the comparative study on the chirality and magnetic conﬁguration
associated with two-ribbon ﬂares: the X3.4-class ﬂare event of AR 10930 on 2006 December 13 and the X2.2-class
ﬂare event of AR 11158 on 2011 February 15. Both the two ﬂare events are classic two-ribbon ﬂares and had been
studied by many authors in literature (see e.g., Kubo et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2007; Guo et al. 2008; Schrijver et al.
2008; Inoue et al. 2012; He et al. 2014 for the ﬂare of AR 10930 and e.g., Schrijver et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2012; Wang
et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2012 for the ﬂare of AR 11158). The two ﬂares, together with their accompanied CMEs, caused
signiﬁcant disturbances to the solar-terrestrial space weather conditions (e.g., Carrano et al., 2009; Malandraki et al.,
2009; Raghav et al., 2018).

As introduced in Section 1, we chose the two ﬂare events because the magnetic ﬁelds in the ﬂare source regions
of the two ARs have opposite chirality (i.e., left-handed for the ﬂare in AR 10930 and right-handed for the ﬂare
in AR 11158; see Section 4 for the detailed chirality analysis), thus they are expected to show diﬀerent magnetic
conﬁgurations. On the other hand, as the classic two-ribbon ﬂares, both the ﬂare events have adequate spatial scale
and purity in morphology and hence are favourable for exhibiting the physical essence compared with the more
compact or more complex ﬂares.

Table 1 summarizes the basic information (source active region, class, date, start time, peak time, location, at-
tribute, and magnetic chirality) of the two major ﬂare events in AR 10930 and AR 11158. The soft X-ray light curves
(1-minute averaged data in 1.0–8.0 Å band) of the two ﬂares are shown in the top panels of Figure 1. The data of the
solar soft X-ray ﬂuxes were acquired by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) and provided
by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, formerly the National Geophysical Data Center; see
https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/satellite/goes/index.html) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). The bottom panels of Figure 1 display the ﬂare-ribbon images of the two ﬂares observed in
chromosphere, which were captured by Solar Optical Telescope (SOT; Tsuneta et al. 2008) aboard the Hinode satellite
(Kosugi et al., 2007) through the Ca ii H spectral line (3968.5 Å).

b The classes, start times, and peak times of the two ﬂare events were compiled and issued by the SWPC of NOAA (see
https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-and-geophysical-event-reports), which were determined
based on the 1-minute averaged 1.0–8.0 Å solar soft X-ray ﬂux data (see top panels of Figures 1) acquired by the GOES
series of satellites.

c The ﬂare locations on the solar disk are expressed in degrees (heliographic coordinate system). ‘S’ means south from
the solar equator and ‘W’ means west from the central meridian. The coordinate values of the X3.4 ﬂare in AR 10930
were derived from the solar 195 Å full-disk image data observed at 2006-12-13 02:36:09 UT by the Extreme-ultraviolet
Imaging Telescope (EIT; Delaboudini`ere et al. 1995) aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft
(Domingo et al., 1995); and the coordinate values of the X2.2 ﬂare in AR 11158 were derived from the solar 94 Å full-
disk image data observed at 2011-02-15 01:56:02 UT by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument (Lemen
et al., 2012) aboard the SDO satellite (Pesnell et al., 2012).

d See Section 4 for the detailed analysis of the magnetic chirality associated with the two ﬂares.

It can be seen from the ﬂare-ribbon images in Figure 1 (bottom panels) that the orientations of the ﬂare-ribbon
distributions (i.e., the pointing direction from one ribbon to another ribbon) are diﬀerent for the two ﬂare events. For
the ﬂare of AR 10930, the orientation of the ﬂare-ribbon distribution is from lower-left to upper-right (or right-leaning;
see Figure 1c); while for the ﬂare of AR 11158, the orientation of the ﬂare-ribbon distribution is from lower-right to
upper-left (or left-leaning; see Figure 1d). The morphology discrepancy of the ﬂare-ribbon distributions implies the
diﬀerent chiral characteristics of the magnetic ﬁelds in the source regions of the two ﬂares (see Section 4 for the
detailed analysis of the magnetic chirality in the ﬂare source regions of the two ARs).

3. Coronal magnetic ﬁeld and nonpotentiality in the source ARs of the two ﬂares

To analyze and compare the magnetic structures associated with the two ﬂare events in AR 10930 and AR 11158,
for each ﬂare source AR, we selected one photospheric vector magnetogram before the ﬂare and one magnetogram
after the ﬂare eruption, and calculated the corresponding coronal magnetic ﬁeld distributions from the photospheric
vector magnetograms based on the NLFFF model. The algorithm of the NLFFF modeling is an improvement to the
direct boundary integral equation (DBIE) approach suggested by Yan and Li (2006). (DBIE, in turn, is an advancement
to the original BIE method proposed by Yan and Sakurai 2000, see also Wang et al. 2000, 2001; He and Wang 2006;
He et al. 2011.) The implementation of the NLFFF algorithm was described in detail in the papers by He and Wang

(2011). This NLFFF modeling method has been utilized for analyzing the coronal magnetic
structures of a variety of solar ARs (e.g., He and Wang, 2008; He et al., 2011, 2012, 2014; Liu et al., 2013; Wang
et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015).

Figure 2 displays the employed photospheric vector magnetograms of AR 10930 and AR 11158 before and after
the ﬂare eruptions. The vertical component of the photospheric vector magnetograms (denoted by Bz) is shown by
the gray scale images (white color representing positive polarity and black color representing negative polarity), and
the transverse component of the vector magnetograms (denoted by (cid:126)Bt) is visualized by the small arrows overlying
the Bz images. The data of the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds of AR 10930 and AR 11158 were acquired by the
Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) instrument of Hinode (Lites et al., 2013) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
instrument of SDO (Scherrer et al., 2012), respectively. For AR 10930, we used the Level 2 data of Hinode-SP
(Lites and Ichimoto, 2013) to yield the regular photospheric vector magnetograms, as described in the paper by He
et al. 2014. For AR 11158, we adopt the hmi.sharp cea 720s photospheric magnetogram data product of the SDO-
HMI vector magnetic ﬁeld pipeline (Bobra et al., 2014; Centeno et al., 2014; Hoeksema et al., 2014). The preﬂare
magnetograms of the two ARs (top row of Figure 2) are the latest photospheric vector magnetograms obtained by the
respective facilities before the start times (see Table 1) of the two ﬂares. The postﬂare magnetograms (bottom row of
Figure 2) correspond to the times that the ﬂare-ribbons of the two ﬂares (as shown in the Ca ii H ﬁltergrams observed
by Hinode-SOT) started to dissipate. The ﬁeld of view of the photospheric vector magnetograms employed in this
work is 160 × 114 Mm (corresponding to 224(cid:48)(cid:48) × 159(cid:48)(cid:48)) for both the ARs (see Figure 2). The projection eﬀect in the
original magnetic ﬁeld data had been corrected.

and 0.36 Mm/pixel (corresponding to 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel) for both the ARs. The black box in each panel indicates the main PIL zone of the corresponding
magnetogram. The magnetogram data of AR 10930 were acquired by the Hinode-SP instrument (Lites et al., 2013), and the magnetogram data of
AR 11158 were acquired by the SDO-HMI instrument (Scherrer et al., 2012). The projection eﬀect in the original magnetic ﬁeld data had been
corrected.

to a similar spatial resolution as that of the HMI data (about 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel or 0.36 Mm/pixel), as displayed in Figure 2.
All the magnetograms were further rebinned to 1(cid:48)(cid:48)/pixel resolution (for reducing the burden of computation) to serve
as the input data of the NLFFF modeling. The azimuth ambiguity in the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁeld data were
resolved with the nonpotential magnetic ﬁeld calculation (NPFC) technique (Georgoulis, 2005) for the Hinode-SP
data, and with the Minimum Energy (ME0) approach (Metcalf, 1994; Leka et al., 2009) for the SDO-HMI data as
adopted by the HMI team (Hoeksema et al., 2014). In this work, our analysis is focused on the main PIL zones of the
magnetograms (see Figure 2 and the descriptions below), where the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld is relatively strong
and the noise level is relatively low, thus the impacts of the diﬀerent instruments and the azimuth disambiguation
methods on the analysis results are minimized (see e.g., Sainz Dalda 2017 for a comprehensive investigation on this
issue).

From the photospheric vector magnetograms of AR 10930 and AR 11158 shown in Figure 2, it can be seen that
the main PILs between the dominant positive polarity and negative polarity of Bz were well developed for both the
ARs. The zones of the main PILs in the magnetograms are indicated by black boxes in Figure 2. Along the main PILs,
the directions of (cid:126)Bt are nearly parallel to the orientations of the PILs, which represents strong magnetic shear. The
strong magnetic shear implies strong magnetic nonpotentiality in the two ARs (Wang et al., 1996; Leka and Barnes,
2003).

The ﬁeld line diagrams of the coronal magnetic ﬁelds (after NLFFF modeling) corresponding to the four photo-
spheric vector magnetograms are illustrated in Figure 3. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the magnetic ﬁeld lines of
both ARs show strong twist around the main PILs (indicated by the black boxes in Figure 3) before the ﬂare, and these
highly twisted ﬁeld lines relaxed to some extent after the ﬂare (see Section 6 for further discussion about the ﬁeld line
relaxation). The strong twist of ﬁeld lines also indicate strong magnetic nonpotentiality in the two ARs (Schrijver,
2016).

It can also be seen from Figure 3 that, the directions of the coronal magnetic ﬁelds along the ﬁeld lines just above
the main PILs are consistent with the directions of (cid:126)Bt along the main PILs in the photosphere (see Figure 2). In AR
10930, the direction of (cid:126)Bt along the main PIL is roughly rightward (see left panels in Figure 2) and the ﬁeld lines
starting from the positive polarity turn right above the main PIL, which leads to the inverse S-shaped twist orientation
of the ﬁeld lines (see left panels in Figure 3). In AR 11158, the direction of (cid:126)Bt along the main PIL is roughly leftward
(see right panels in Figure 2) and the ﬁeld lines starting from the positive polarity turn left above the main PIL, which
leads to the S-shaped twist orientation of the ﬁeld lines (see right panels in Figure 3). The diﬀerent twist orientations
of the ﬁeld lines around the main PILs imply the diﬀerent chiral characteristics of the associated magnetic ﬁelds in
the two ARs (see Section 4 for the detailed description of the magnetic chirality). In observations, the twist of ﬁeld
lines correspond to the sigmoids of coronal loops as seen in the solar soft X-ray images, which also exhibit the chiral
character and the S-shaped or inverse S-shaped pattern (see e.g., Canﬁeld et al., 1999, 2007).

To exhibit the nonpotential characteristics of the two ARs more directly, we calculated the values of the electric
current density j from the coronal magnetic ﬁeld data by using Equation (1). The spatial distributions of the derived
current density in the two ARs are illustrated in Figure 4, where the four panels correspond to the four coronal
magnetic ﬁeld diagrams shown in Figure 3 (and also the four photospheric magnetograms shown in Figure 2). It can
be seen from Figure 4 that the electric current in the two ARs is distributed mostly in the zones around the main PILs
(indicated by the white boxes in Figure 4), which is consistent with the strong twist of ﬁeld lines around the main
PILs shown in Figure 3 and the strong magnetic shear along the main PILs shown in Figure 2. In particular, there
exists an area possessing the highest current density values (indicated by white arrows and labeled with ‘Core Area’
in Figure 4) in each of the ARs. By comparing the current density images with the ﬂare-ribbon images shown in
Figure 1, it can be seen that the core areas of current density coincide with the locations of ﬂare onset in-between the
ﬂare ribbons. This result indicates that both the two ﬂares initiated in the local regions with strongest current density,
which represent the areas with most active level and strongest nonpotentiality in the two ARs.

Figure 4 also shows that the patterns of the current density distributions in the core areas of the two ARs (indicated
by the white arrows in Figure 4) present apparent changes before (see the top panels of Figure 4) and after (see the
bottom panels of Figure 4) the ﬂares, which implies the variations of the internal coronal magnetic structures before
and after the ﬂare eruptions. We will investigate and compare the magnetic conﬁgurations associated with the two
ﬂare events in Section 5.

Chirality of the magnetic ﬁelds in the ﬂare source regions

The photospheric vector magnetograms of AR 10930 and AR 11158 shown in Figure 2 exhibit that, for both the
ARs, the positive polarity of Bz is roughly below the main PIL and the negative polarity is above the main PIL (see
the main PIL zones enclosed by the black boxes in Figure 2). Yet the direction of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld vectors
(cid:126)Bt (illustrated by the small arrows in Figure 2) along the main PILs is opposite for the two ARs, that is, (cid:126)Bt is roughly
rightward for AR 10930 and leftward for AR 11158. This discrepancy represents the opposite chiral characteristics
of the magnetic ﬁelds in the ﬂare source regions (the main PIL zones) of the two ARs. Speciﬁcally, the left-handed or
right-handed chirality is deﬁned by the morphological relation between the direction of (cid:126)Bt and the polarity orientation
of Bz following the left-hand or right-hand rule, in which the thumb points in the direction of (cid:126)Bt and the other four
ﬁngers point from the positive polarity to the negative polarity of Bz with the palm facing the PIL. Thus, the magnetic
chirality in the main PIL zones of the two ARs is left-handed for AR 10930 and right-handed for AR 11158. Note
that this deﬁnition of the chirality for the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds is consistent with the chirality deﬁnition
in literature for the chromospheric ﬁlaments (e.g., Martin, 1998; Ouyang et al., 2017) and the magnetic helicity (e.g.,
Rust and Kumar, 1994; Pevtsov, 2005; Pevtsov et al., 2014).

The chiral characteristics of the magnetic ﬁelds in solar ARs can also be quantitatively reﬂected by the signs of
force-free factor α of the coronal magnetic ﬁelds. Considering the equation of the force-free ﬁeld, ∇ × B = αB, the
values of α can be computed from the coronal magnetic ﬁeld data by using equation (He et al., 2011, 2014):

α = (∇ × B) · B

B2

.

(4)

The order of magnitude of α is about 0.1 Mm−1 in the lower layers of corona and decreases rapidly with height (see
e.g., He et al. 2014). Figure 5 illustrates the distributions of force-free factor α in the two ARs at height of 1.8 Mm,
where the four panels correspond to the four coronal magnetic ﬁeld diagrams shown in Figure 3 (and also the four
photospheric magnetograms shown in Figure 2 and the four current density diagrams shown in Figure 4). It can be
seen from Figure 5 that, along the main PILs of the two ARs (enclosed by the black boxes in Figure 5), α < 0 for
AR 10930 (see the left panels of Figure 5; the negative α being rendered in red color) and α > 0 for AR 11158 (see
the right panels of Figure 5; the positive α being rendered in blue color), which quantitatively reﬂects the left-handed
chirality around the main PIL of AR 10930 and the right-handed chirality of AR 11158.

The correspondence between the signs of force-free factor α and the chirality of the magnetic ﬁelds can be un-
derstood as follows: In the photospheric vector magnetograms of the two ARs (see Figure 2), the positive polarity
of Bz is below the main PILs and the negative polarity is above the main PILs. To be compatible with the polarity
distribution of Bz, the direction of the electric current density along the main PILs should be leftward for both the
ARs according to the Ampere’s rule in electromagnetism. In AR 10930 with left-handed chirality, the direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld along the main PIL is rightward (consistent with the direction of (cid:126)Bt shown in Figure 2), which is
opposite to the leftward direction of the electric current density, and hence α < 0 (see Equation (2)); while in AR
11158 with right-handed chirality, the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld along the main PIL is leftward, which is the
same as the direction of the electric current density, and hence α > 0.

The left-handed or right-handed magnetic chirality around the main PILs of the two ARs can also be reﬂected by
the twist orientation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld lines (inverse S-shaped or S-shaped, see the diagram illustration
in Figure 3 and description in Section 3) and the orientation of the ﬂare-ribbon distribution (right-leaning or left-
leaning, see the ﬂare-ribbon images in Figures 1c and 1d and description in Section 2), which are all consistent with
the directions of (cid:126)Bt along the main PILs in the photosphere (see the photospheric vector magnetograms in Figure 2).
Table 2 summarizes the correspondence between the various features representing magnetic chirality, which include
direction of (cid:126)Bt in the photosphere, sign of force-free factor α, twist orientation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld lines, and
orientation of the ﬂare-ribbon distribution.

5. Magnetic conﬁgurations associated with the two ﬂares

The spatial distribution diagrams of the force-free factor α shown in Figure 5 not only indicate the chiral charac-
teristics of the magnetic ﬁelds in the two ARs by its sign, but also exhibit the magnetic connectivity properties in the

in each panel indicates the main PIL zone of the corresponding photospheric magnetogram (same box position as in Figure 2). The α distributions
in the marginal areas are noisy owing to the very weak magnetic ﬁeld there.

Note that in the force-free magnetic ﬁeld, α is a constant along each ﬁeld line
(see the description in Section 1). It can be seen in Figure 5 that, for both the ARs, the patterns of the α distributions in
the main PIL zones of the ARs (see the regions enclosed by the black boxes in Figure 5) have apparent changes before
(top panels of Figure 5) and after (bottom panels of Figure 5) the ﬂares, which from another point of view (in addition
to the distribution variations of the electric current density j shown in Figure 4) exhibits the variations of the internal
coronal magnetic structures before and after the ﬂare eruptions. Note that in corona the electric current density j, the
force-free factor α, and the magnetic ﬁeld B are connected by Equation (2). Relative to the fundamental magnetic
ﬁeld data shown in Figures 2 and 3, the derived diﬀerential quantities α and j shown in Figures 4 and 5 can reveal the
variations of the internal magnetic structures more explicitly. In this work, we investigate and compare the magnetic
conﬁgurations associated with the two ﬂare events in AR 10930 and AR 11158 through the spatial distributions of α
and j.

The enlarged α distribution maps in the central areas of the two ARs before and after the ﬂare eruptions are
shown in the left part of Figure 6 (top row for AR 10930 and bottom row for AR 11158). From the α distribution
diagrams before the ﬂares (leftmost column in Figure 6) it can be seen that, for both the ARs, there exists a strip of
concentrated strong α distribution along the main PIL (see the regions enclosed by the black boxes), which indicates
that a magnetic connectivity was formed along the main PIL before the ﬂare. By comparing with the electric current
density distribution diagrams before the ﬂares (see the top panels of Figure 4), it can be found that, for both the ARs,
the magnetic connectivity along the main PIL is co-localized with the core area featured by the highest current density
values (indicated by the white arrows in Figure 4). We refer to these magnetic connectivity accompanied with the
strong electric current as the prominent magnetic connectivity. In Figure 6, the prominent magnetic connectivity as
well as the accompanied strong electric current in the two ARs are indicated by golden bars. Note that, because the
strengths of the force-free factor α and the current density j decrease rapidly with height (see e.g., He et al. 2014), the
prominent magnetic connectivity characterized by both strong α and strong current density mainly distributes at low
altitude.

From the second column of Figure 6 it can be seen that, after the ﬂare eruption the prominent magnetic connectivity
was totally broken and manifests as two separated branches of strong α distributions (indicated by the two light-blue
bars in Figure 6) around the main PIL. This is the same for the two ARs. However, the relative position of the two
branches of broken magnetic connectivity is diﬀerent in the two ARs. For AR 10930 it is lower-left to upper-right,
and for AR 11158 it is upper-left to lower-right. As a result, the two branches of the broken magnetic connectivity
(represented by the two light-blue bars) combined with the prominent magnetic connectivity or the associated strong
electric current formed before the ﬂare (represented by the golden bar) compose a Z-shaped conﬁguration in AR 10930
and an inverse Z-shaped conﬁguration in AR 11158, which is sketched on the right of the ‘=’ symbols in Figure 6.
As shown in Figure 6, the Z-shaped magnetic conﬁguration associated with the ﬂare event in AR 10930 corresponds
to the left-handed magnetic chirality (negative α) in the ﬂare source region around the main PIL of AR 10930, and
the inverse Z-shaped magnetic conﬁguration associated with the ﬂare event in AR 11158 corresponds to the right-
handed magnetic chirality (positive α) of AR 11158. In Section 6, we give interpretation and further discussions on
the correspondence relationship between the magnetic conﬁguration and the magnetic chirality.

6. Discussion

We suggest that the correspondence between the magnetic conﬁgurations (Z-shaped or inverse Z-shaped) associ-
ated with the ﬂares and the magnetic chirality (left-handed or right-handed) in the ﬂare source regions is concerned
with the direction of the local Lorentz force that drives the ﬂare initial eruption, which is sketched in the rightmost
column of Figure 6 and elucidated below.

In our scenario of ﬂare initiation (He et al., 2014), the breaking of the prominent magnetic connectivity (as a
sudden change of topological structure of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld) is driven by the evolution of the photospheric
magnetic ﬁeld which acts as the bottom boundary condition of the corona system. At the breaking site of the prominent
magnetic connectivity, the direction of the background magnetic ﬁeld (denoted by B (cid:48) in the rightmost schematic
diagrams of Figure 6) is deﬂected from the direction of the preﬂare magnetic ﬁeld (denoted by B0 in Figure 6) and is
now roughly aligned with the two branches of broken magnetic connectivity (see Appendix A for diagram illustration
of the magnetic ﬁeld deﬂection at the magnetic connectivity breaking site before and after the two ﬂares). The strong
electric current associated with the prominent magnetic connectivity formed before the ﬂare is no longer consistent

Figure 6: Diagrams illustrating (a) the Z-shaped magnetic conﬁguration of the X3.4 ﬂare event of AR 10930 and (b) the inverse Z-shaped magnetic
conﬁguration of the X2.2 ﬂare event of AR 11158. The subplots on the left of the ‘=’ symbols show the α distribution maps in the central areas of
the two ARs before and after the ﬂare eruptions. The black boxes in the α diagrams indicate the main PIL zones, which are the same as in Figure
5. The bars in golden color in the preﬂare α diagrams represent the prominent magnetic connectivities as well as the associated strong electric
currents (characterized by the highest current density values in the core areas shown in Figure 4) formed before the ﬂares; and the bars in light-blue
color in the postﬂare α diagrams indicate the two branches of the broken magnetic connectivity. The sketches on the right of the ‘=’ symbols
illustrate the Z-shaped (for AR 10930) or the inverse Z-shaped (for AR 11158) conﬁguration composed by the two light-blue bars (representing
the two branches of the broken magnetic connectivity) and the golden bar (representing the prominent magnetic connectivity or the associated
strong electric current before the ﬂare). The golden bar in the Z-shaped or inverse Z-shaped diagrams also represents the isolated electric current
at the magnetic connectivity breaking site left over from the strong electric current formed before the ﬂare (associated with the preﬂare prominent
magnetic connectivity). The rightmost schematic diagrams illustrate the upward Lorentz force f (cid:48) = j (cid:48) × B (cid:48) acting on the isolated electric current
(represented by the current density vector j (cid:48)) at the magnetic connectivity breaking site. B0 (in gray color) shows the direction of the force-free
magnetic ﬁeld before the ﬂare, which is anti-parallel to the direction of j (cid:48) for AR 10930 and parallel to the direction of j (cid:48) for AR 11158 (note that
j (cid:48) inherits the direction of the preﬂare electric current density). B (cid:48) is the deﬂected background magnetic ﬁeld owing to the breaking of magnetic
connectivity, which is roughly aligned with the two branches of broken magnetic connectivity (see Appendix A for diagram illustration). It is this
magnetic ﬁeld deﬂection from B0 to B (cid:48) that introduces the local Lorentz force f (cid:48) on the isolated electric current and causes the ﬂare initial eruption.

diagrams shown in the right part of Figure 6 also represent this isolated electric current at the magnetic connectivity
breaking site.

As demonstrated in the rightmost schematic diagrams of Figure 6, there is an angle between the deﬂected back-
ground magnetic ﬁeld B (cid:48) and the isolated electric current (represented by the current density vector j (cid:48) in the diagrams)
at the magnetic connectivity breaking site. Then the local corona system is deviated from the force-free condition and
becomes unstable, and the deﬂected background magnetic ﬁeld B (cid:48) exerts a local Lorentz force f (cid:48) on the electric
current j (cid:48):

f (cid:48) = j (cid:48) × B (cid:48).

(5)

Since j (cid:48) represents the isolated electric current (at the magnetic connectivity breaking site) left over from the strong
electric current formed before the ﬂare, it inherits the direction of the preﬂare electric current density (parallel or anti-
parallel to B0). According to the descriptions in Section 4, the direction of B0 is opposite to the direction of electric
current density in AR 10930 owing to the negative α or left-handed chirality of the AR, and is the same as the direction
of electric current density in AR 11158 owing to the positive α or right-handed chirality of the AR. As illustrated in the
rightmost diagrams of Figure 6, the direction of j (cid:48) is leftward for both the ARs, while the direction of B0 is rightward
for AR 10930 and leftward for AR 11158. The diagrams in the rightmost column of Figure 6 also exhibit that, the
deﬂection of B (cid:48) relative to B0 is clockwise for AR 10930 owing to the Z-shaped magnetic conﬁguration in the AR,
and is anticlockwise for AR 11158 owing to the inverse Z-shaped magnetic conﬁguration in the AR. As a result, the
direction of the Lorentz force f (cid:48) acting on the isolated electric current j (cid:48) is upward for both the ARs (see the rightmost
diagrams of Figure 6), which leads to the ejection of the isolated electric current and associated plasmas. Along with
the ejection of the electric current, the free magnetic energy associated with the ejected current is released. Then
the ﬂare eruption is initiated. Owing to the loss of the ejected electric current and the depletion of the free magnetic
energy associated with the ejected current, the ﬁeld lines surrounding the main PIL show some extent of relaxation
after ﬂare eruption, as illustrated in Figure 3 and described in Section 3.

The above discussion shows that, to drive the ﬂare initial eruption, the upward direction of the local Lorentz
force acting on the isolated electric current at the magnetic connectivity breaking site requires the correspondence
relationship between the magnetic conﬁgurations associated with the ﬂares and the magnetic chirality in the ﬂare
source regions, that is, the Z-shaped conﬁguration for the left-handed chirality (α < 0) (e.g., the ﬂare in AR 10930)
and the inverse Z-shaped conﬁguration for the right-handed chirality (α > 0) (e.g., the ﬂare in AR 11158). We
speculate that two-ribbon ﬂares can be generally classiﬁed to these two magnetic conﬁgurations (Z-shaped or inverse
Z-shaped) by the chiral characteristics (left-handed or right-handed) of magnetic ﬁelds in the ﬂare source regions of
ARs. The opposite combinations, i.e., a Z-shaped conﬁguration with a right-handed chirality (α > 0) or an inverse
Z-shaped conﬁguration with a left-handed chirality (α < 0), are not likely for the two-ribbon ﬂares, because in these
cases the local Lorentz force acting on the isolated electric current at the magnetic connectivity breaking site would
be downward and cannot lead to eruption. In Figure 7, we summarize the four possible situations of combination
between the magnetic conﬁguration and the magnetic chirality.

7. Conclusion

In this paper, we made a comparative analysis on the chiral characteristics and the magnetic conﬁgurations associ-
ated with two X-class two-ribbon solar ﬂares happening in AR 10930 and AR 11158 (see Table 1). The photospheric
vector magnetograms of the two ARs (see Figure 2) were observed by the Hinode and the SDO satellites, respectively.
The corresponding coronal magnetic ﬁelds (see Figure 3) were obtained by the numerical computation based on the
NLFFF model. We employed two quantitative measures, the electric current density j (see Equation (1) and Figure 4)
and the force-free factor α (see Equation (4) and Figure 5), to reﬂect the internal structural properties of the coronal
magnetic ﬁelds in the two ARs before and after the ﬂares.

The analysis by the spatial distributions of the electric current density j showed that, the electric current in the
two ARs was distributed mostly around the main PILs (see Figure 4) where the ﬂares happened. There exists an
area possessing the highest current density values in each of the ARs (labeled with ‘Core Area’ in Figure 4), which
indicates the local region with most active level and strongest nonpotentiality in the two ARs and hence implies the

the magnetic chirality in ﬂare source regions (left-handed or right-handed). The two situations highlighted with green color have upward local
Lorentz force f (cid:48), and hence can lead to the initial eruption of ﬂares. The other two situations have downward local Lorentz force and cannot lead
to eruption. (See Figure 6 for the meanings of the symbols and the main text in Section 6 for the detailed explanation.)

This result of concentrated electric current build-up in ﬂare source region is
consistent with the conclusion by D´emoulin et al. (1996) via QSL method as introduced in Section 1.

The analysis on the chiral characteristics of the magnetic ﬁelds in the ﬂare source regions around the main PILs
showed that, although the photospheric magnetic ﬁelds of the two ARs are complex, the chirality of the magnetic ﬁelds
around the main PILs in the photosphere (indicated by the morphological relation between the direction of (cid:126)Bt and the
polarity orientation of Bz; see Figure 2 and the description in Section 4) and in the corona (indicated by the sign of
force-free factor α; see Figure 5 and the description in Section 4) is coherent for both the ARs, that is, left-handed
(α < 0) for AR 10930 and right-handed (α > 0) for AR 11158. The magnetic chirality in the ﬂare source regions
can also be reﬂected by the twist orientation of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld lines (see Figure 3) and the orientation of
the ﬂare-ribbon distribution (see Figures 1c and 1d). The correspondence relationship between the various features
representing magnetic chirality is summarized in Table 2.

The analysis on the magnetic conﬁgurations associated with the ﬂares shows that, for both the ﬂare events, a
prominent magnetic connectivity (featured by co-localized strong α and strong electric current density distributions)
was formed along the main PIL before ﬂare and was totally broken after ﬂare eruption. Yet the two branches of broken
magnetic connectivity, combined with the prominent magnetic connectivity (or the associated strong electric current)
before the ﬂare, compose the opposite magnetic conﬁgurations for the two ﬂares owing to the opposite magnetic
chirality in the ﬂare source regions of the two ARs. That is, Z-shaped conﬁguration for the ﬂare in AR 10930 with
left-handed chirality (negative α) and inverse Z-shaped conﬁguration for the ﬂare in AR 11158 with right-handed
chirality (positive α), as illustrated in Figure 6. We suggest that it is the upward local Lorentz force acting on the
isolated electric current at the magnetic connectivity breaking site (left over from the strong electric current formed
before the ﬂare) that drives the ﬂare initial eruption, and the requirement of the upward direction of the local Lorentz
force results in the correspondence relationship between the magnetic conﬁgurations associated with the ﬂares and
the magnetic chirality in the ﬂare source regions. It is speculated that two-ribbon ﬂares can be generally classiﬁed to
these two magnetic conﬁgurations (Z-shaped or inverse Z-shaped) by magnetic chirality (left-handed or right-handed)
in the ﬂare source regions of ARs. This speculation needs to be validated by analyzing a large sample of solar ﬂare
events (both eruptive and non-eruptive) in the future work.

The analysis results of this study can be applied to the solar ﬂare prediction studies and services (He et al., 2008,
2012, 2018a; Wang et al., 2008, 2009, 2018). The magnetic conﬁguration of solar ﬂares can also provide useful
implications for analyzing the magnetic and ﬂare activity properties of solar-type stars (He et al., 2015, 2018b,c,d;
Yun et al., 2016, 2017; Mehrabi et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Mehrabi and He, 2019; Goodarzi et al., 2019; Zhang et al.,
2020).

Appendix A. Deﬂection of the magnetic ﬁeld at the magnetic connectivity breaking site before and after the

two ﬂares

In Figures A.8 and A.9, we display the magnetic ﬁeld azimuths at the magnetic connectivity breaking site before
and after the two ﬂares in AR 10930 (see Figure A.8) and AR 11158 (see Figure A.9). In each ﬁgure, the top panels
show the vector magnetograms at the height of 1.8 Mm in the central area of the AR before and after the ﬂare; and the
bottom panels show the corresponding α distribution maps at the same height. The azimuths of the magnetic ﬁeld at
the magnetic connectivity breaking site are indicated by the long black arrows located near the center of each panel.

Figures A.8 and A.9 illustrate the deﬂection of the magnetic ﬁeld at the magnetic connectivity breaking site before
and after the ﬂares in both the ARs. For AR 10930, the magnetic ﬁeld deﬂection is clockwise; and for AR 11158 the
deﬂection is anticlockwise. From the bottom panels of Figures A.8 and A.9 (α distribution diagrams) it can be seen
that, for both the ﬂare events in the two ARs, the azimuth of the magnetic ﬁeld at the magnetic connectivity breaking
site is roughly aligned with the prominent magnetic connectivity before the ﬂare and roughly aligned with the two
branches of broken magnetic connectivity after the ﬂare. This result is used in Section 6 (Discussion) and Figure 6.

It should be noticed that near the PIL, the strength of the transverse ﬁeld in photosphere increases after ﬂares
(e.g., Wang and Liu, 2010; Wang et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012), which is interpreted by the back reaction eﬀect of
ﬂare eruptions in literature (e.g., Wang and Liu, 2010; Hudson et al., 2008). The breaking of the prominent magnetic
connectivity and the deﬂection of the magnetic ﬁeld at the magnetic connectivity breaking site discussed in this paper
are diﬀerent phenomena. They happen in low corona and above the photosphere, and are driven by the evolution of
the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld which acts as the bottom boundary condition of the corona system (He et al., 2014).

Figure A.8: Diagram illustrating the deﬂection of the magnetic ﬁeld at the magnetic connectivity breaking site before and after the ﬂare in AR
10930. Top row: vector magnetograms at the height of 1.8 Mm in the central area of the AR before (left column) and after (right column) the
ﬂare; bottom row: α distribution maps at at the height of 1.8 Mm corresponding to the magnetograms. The black box in each panel indicates the
main PIL zone of AR 10930 (same box position as in previous ﬁgures). The azimuths of the magnetic ﬁeld at the magnetic connectivity breaking
site before and after the ﬂare are indicated by the long black arrows located near the center of each panel. The coordinates of the start point of the
long arrows are X = 66.4 Mm, Y = 48.2 Mm, where the magnetic ﬁeld azimuths are sampled. In the top panels, the gray scale images display the
vertical component (Bz) of the magnetograms and the small arrows overlying the gray scale images represent the transverse component ((cid:126)Bt) of the
magnetograms. Note that the long black arrows belong to the arrow array of (cid:126)Bt; they are enlarged to demonstrate the deﬂection of the magnetic
ﬁeld at the magnetic connectivity breaking site more clearly.
