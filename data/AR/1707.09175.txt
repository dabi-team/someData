Standard Model vacuum decay in a de Sitter Background

Arttu Rajantie and Stephen Stopyra
Department of Physics, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom
(Dated: July 28, 2017)

We present a calculation of thick-wall Coleman-de-Luccia (CdL) bounces in the Standard Model
eﬀective potential in a de Sitter background. The calculation is performed including the eﬀect of the
bounce back-reaction on the metric, which we compare with the case of a ﬁxed de-Sitter background,
and with similar full-backreaction calculation in a model polynomial potential. The results show
that the Standard Model potential exhibits non-trivial behavior: rather than a single CdL solution,
there are multiple (non-oscillating) bounce solutions which may contribute to the decay rate. All
the extra solutions found have higher actions than the largest amplitude solution, and thus would
not contribute signiﬁcantly to the decay rate, but their existence demonstrates that CdL solutions in
the Standard Model potential are not unique, and the existence of additional, lower action, solutions
cannot be ruled out. This suggests that a better understanding of the appearance and disappearance
of CdL solutions in de Sitter space is needed to fully understand the vacuum instability issue in the
Standard Model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

One of the questions raised by the discovery of the
Higgs boson[1, 2] has been the implications it has for the
stability of the electroweak vacuum. The possibility that
the electroweak vacuum might be metastable and vulner-
able to spontaneous nucleation of true vacuum bubbles
via quantum tunneling was considered even before the
discovery of the Higgs boson[3], but the measurements
of a Higgs mass around Mh = 125.09 ± 0.25GeV and
top quark mass of 173.21GeV[4] suggest that this may
in fact be the real situation in the Standard Model. Of
particular note is that these measurements place the
Higgs boson in a narrow region of parameter space for
which the electroweak vacuum is neither completely sta-
ble, nor so unstable that it should have already decayed
in the lifetime of the universe[5]. That the Higgs and
top quark masses lie in this narrow metastability region
may indicate new physics which stabilizes the potential.
Consistency with the present day observations of the
electroweak vacuum require that no true vacuum bubble
is likely to have nucleated in our past light cone.
Vacuum instability in a Minkowski background has
see references [5–7] for
been investigated extensively:
example, and the eﬀects of gravitational backreaction
of the vacuum bubbles has also been studied by many
authors[8–10]. The second point - nucleation of true
vacuum bubbles during inﬂation, is a somewhat more
diﬃcult question to answer. This question has been
addressed by many authors[11–18]. The nucleation rate
can be computed by a semi-classical evaluation of the
for the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude,
path integral
which after a Wick rotation to Euclidean space gives an
estimate of the vacuum energy, of which the imaginary
part yields the rate at which tunneling out of the false
vacuum occurs[19]. This path integral is dominated by
in particular the saddle-points
its stationary points:
which give the dominant contribution to the imaginary
part due possessing an unstable direction. The Euclidean
action of these bounce solutions determines the leading

order contribution to the decay rate, with the solutions
with the smallest action dominating.
In this paper we will present numerical calculations of
the ‘bounce solutions’, that dominate this path integral,
in a de Sitter background and using the Standard Model
eﬀective potential. The calculation of bounces in a de
Sitter background if often simpliﬁed by assuming that
the background is a ﬁxed de Sitter metric, unaﬀected by
back-reaction of the bounce solution. This is valid if the
diﬀerence in energy between the false vacuum, the top
of the barrier, and the true vacuum is small compared
to the background energy density in the false vacuum,
V0. However, the depth of the Standard Model eﬀective
potential
is such that this assumption does not hold
for the Hubble rates usually involved in inﬂationary
cosmology, and the ﬂat space bounce solution is known
to probe depths only an order of magnitude below the
Planck scale[8–10]. Thus, it is possible that backreaction
of the bounce solution could have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on
the nucleation rate. For this reason, we compute the
bounce solutions including all these backreaction eﬀects,
without assuming that the metric is a ﬁxed de Sitter
background. We compare these results with the ﬁxed
background case.
Additionally, a recent paper by Joti et al.
[20] also
considered vacuum instability in a de Sitter background
using a perturbative approach. We will compare our
results to [20] in more detail in section VIII.

A. Thermal vs Quantum Tunneling eﬀects

Another useful technique for computing the decay rate
of a false vacuum in de Sitter space is to use the Stochas-
tic approach to inﬂation[21], which considers the long
wavelength (superhorizon) behavior of the Higgs ﬁeld as
being eﬀectively a classical ﬁeld which receives stochas-
tic ‘kicks’ from the sub-horizon ﬁeld modes. This yields a
Langevin and associated Fokker-Planck equation, which

 
 
 
 
 
 
can be used to compute the probability that a given por-
tion of false vacuum will remain in the false vacuum for
some number of e-folds of inﬂation. Examples of this ap-
proach being applied to Higgs stability during inﬂation
can be found in references [13, 18].
A question may be asked, however, about the relation-
ship between the Fokker-Planck approach to computing
the false vacuum survival probability and the Coleman
de Luccia prescription for computing the nucleation rate
of true vacuum bubbles. This process is decidedly sub-
horizon, and by averaging over sub-horizon modes the
Stochastic approach obscures this information. As a spe-
ciﬁc example of how things become unclear, consider the
late time static solution for the probability distribution
arising from the Fokker-Planck equation[21]:

where H0 =
V (φ) − V0 the diﬀerence between V (φ) and the false
vacuum potential energy, V0 = V (φfv).

is the Hubble rate, ∆V (φ) =

The result of this stochastic analysis can be compared
to the Coleman de Luccia (CdL) prescription (see [19])
for computing the rate of true vacuum bubble nucleation,
which in principle should include all the sub-horizon
eﬀects. The CdL prescription says that, analogous
to ﬂat space, the rate of bubble nucleation in a false
vacuum is determined by the action of so called ‘bounce’
solutions to the Euclideanized equation of motion (this
will be discussed in more detail in section II).

There is a trivial solution of the Euclidean equations
of motion consisting of the ﬁeld sitting at the top
of the barrier - this is known as the Hawking-Moss
instanton[22]. Its action, when |∆V (φ)| (cid:28) V0 predicts
a decay Γ ∝ e−B with B matching the exponent in Eq.
(1). However, there are other, non-trivial solutions -
known as Coleman de Luccia (CdL) bounces. These
are analogous to the bounce solution that describes
tunneling in a Minkowski background[23, 24], however,
there are important diﬀerences - the bounce solutions in
ﬂat space must approach the false vacuum at inﬁnity,
while the bounce solutions in de-Sitter space exist on a
compact Euclidean manifold and do not reach the false
vacuum (as we will see in section II). The interpretation
of these bounce solutions was discussed by Brown
and Weinberg[25]:
the tunneling procedure can be
regarded as a usual quantum tunneling procedure taking
place in a thermal bath of Hawking-Radiation at the
Gibbons-Hawking temperature of de-Sitter space[26].
This explains the exponent in Eq. (1): it represents the
probability that thermal ﬂuctuations will lift an entire
Hubble-volume sphere (volume 4π
) from the false
3
vacuum to the top of the barrier of the potential, at
the Gibbons-Hawking temperature, TGH = H0
2π of the

(cid:16) 1

Horizon. The CdL solutions, on the other hand, can be
interpreted as tunneling proceeding by thermal excita-
tion pushing the Higgs ﬁeld partially up the barrier, and
then the ﬁeld tunneling the rest of the way through.
Crucially, the Hawking-Moss and CdL solutions describe
the average eﬀect of many possible routes through the
barrier, either through thermal ﬂuctuation, quantum
tunneling, or a combination of the two. This is why they
appear to describe homogeneous excitations of an entire
Hubble volume.

B. Existence and uniqueness of bounce solutions

There is, however, an issue with the Hawking-Moss
solution, and thus presumably the Fokker-Planck analy-
sis that appears to reproduce it. Coleman showed that
bounce solutions must have one and only one negative
eigenvalue in the spectrum of linear ﬁeld ﬂuctuations
about them[27] (strictly speaking, as Coleman stated,
this analysis does not apply to de Sitter bounces,
however, Brown and Weinberg[25] argued that the
conclusion is the same). The Hawking-Moss solution,
however, acquires additional negative modes below a
certain Hubble rate[25, 28], H0crit,
implying that for
low Hubble rates,
it may not describe the tunneling
process.
If this is the case, then it would be expected
that a CdL solution should control tunneling instead.
Indeed, for H0 < H0crit, it can be shown that a CdL
bounce always exists (provided the potential has a
barrier)[29]. Above this threshold, the existence of CdL
bounces is not guaranteed. If there are no CdL bounces
for H0 > H0crit,
then the Hawking-Moss solution
controls vacuum decay, and it would be expected by
continuity that the CdL bounce merges smoothly with
the Hawking-Moss solution as H0 crosses H0crit from
below. We will argue in this paper, however, that if CdL
solutions do exist above this threshold, there must be
more than one of them.
This brings us to the subject of this paper - CdL
solutions do exist for H0 > H0crit in the Standard Model
eﬀective potential, and thus there is not one but multiple
CdL solutions contributing to vacuum instability in
the Standard Model. We ﬁnd examples of these extra
solutions and compute their Euclidean actions to assess
their relevance to tunneling in the Standard Model.

C. Overview

We will address these questions by computing (numer-
ically) bounce solutions in the Standard Model at non-
zero Hubble rate, and comparing these to a simpler poly-
nomial model, as well the same Standard Model eﬀective
potential with a ﬁxed de Sitter background. Section II
will describe the basics of the CdL prescription for com-

puting tunneling rates. In section III we will discuss the
eigenvalue spectrum of the Hawking-Moss instanton and
review how this leads to a ‘critical Hubble rate’, H0crit,
below which the Hawking-Moss solution does not con-
tribute to tunneling.
In section IV we will discuss the
numerical techniques used to ﬁnd the bounce solutions.
This involves numerical challenges arising from the fact
that we wish to compute ‘thick-wall’ bounces without
using the ﬁxed background approximation, in order to
take into account the eﬀects of gravitational backreac-
tion, which is potentially signiﬁcant since the energy
scale of the Standard Model true vacuum is expected
to be much larger than the barrier scale or most con-
ceivable inﬂationary energy scales. In sections V and VI
we will present the results of calculations in the polyno-
mial model potential, and the Standard Model eﬀective
potential, respectively, comparing the calculations with
full back-reaction to the results using a ﬁxed de Sitter
background for the Standard Model case (section VI).
We will see that there are signiﬁcant qualitative diﬀer-
ences between the two scenarios, with the polynomial
model resulting in a ‘well-behaved’ smooth transition to
Hawking-Moss dominance when H0 is raised past the
critical threshold, and the Standard Model exhibiting a
much sharper transition, with the appearance of addi-
tional non-oscillating solutions. Finally, we will discuss
what happens as the Hubble rate tends to zero, present-
ing analytic and numerical arguments that the results
should smoothly approach those obtained for a ﬂat false
vacuum.

II. VACUUM DECAY IN DE SITTER SPACE:
CDL PRESCRIPTION

A. CdL Basics

The decay rate of a vacuum set by a single scalar ﬁeld

coupled to gravity is given by[19]:

Γ = A exp(−B),

(2)

where A is a prefactor determined by computing func-
tional determinant ﬂuctuations around a bounce solution
to the Euclidean action:

SE[φ, gµν] =

∇µφ∇µφ + V (φ) −

M 2
P

(3)
Throughout this paper, MP denotes the ‘reduced Planck
Mass’, MP =
. The exponent, B, is given by the
diﬀerence between the action of this bounce and the ac-
tion of the ‘false vacuum solution’, where the ﬁeld sits in
the false vacuum φ(χ) = φfv.

8πGN

1√

R

B = S[φ, gµν] − S[φfv, gfvµν].

(4)

The bounce solution which determines the decay rate is
the solution for which B (and thus S[φ, gµν]) is smallest.

3

Other solutions can contribute to the decay rate, but if
their action is larger then they give exponentially sup-
pressed contributions.
The smallest action solutions can be found by extrem-
izing the action and solving the Euclidean equations of
motion for the coupled gravitational and scalar ﬁeld. To
simplify this calculation, it can be assumed that the dom-
inant solutions are O(4) symmetric. This was proven in
the absence of gravity (see [30]), and is believed to be
likely when gravity is included and the background re-
spects this symmetry (see references [31, 32] for a discus-
sion). Under this assumption, the metric can be placed
in a co-ordinate system that takes the form:

ds2 = dχ2 + a2(χ)dΩ2
3,

(5)

where dΩ2
3 is the metric of a 3-sphere. The χ co-ordinate
is a radial parameter, and a(χ) describes the radius of
curvature of a 3-sphere of co-ordinate radius χ. The
equations of motion in this case are:

(8)

Equation (8) is equivalent to diﬀerentiating Eq. (7), but
we include it because it is in fact easier to use numeri-
cally, due to not requiring a choice of sign when taking
the square root of the RHS of Eq. (7). This is important
because in a de Sitter background, ˙a does in fact change
sign. Note that the ﬁrst term on the RHS of Eq. (7) is
always 1 is due to the fact that the surfaces of constant
χ always have the geometry of a 3-sphere due to O(4)
symmetry, and thus always have positive ‘spatial’ curva-
ture. This does not imply that the geometry of the full
four dimensional space is positive, however, and it can in
fact be negative in regions where the potential is negative
(such as the interior of a nucleated vacuum bubble):

When evaluated at a solution of these equations of mo-
tion, the decay exponent take the form:

B =

− 2π2

(cid:90) χmax

dχa3(χ)V (φ(χ)),

(10)

where V0 ≡ V (φfv), and χmax is the (possibly inﬁnite)
maximum value of χ that covers the entire patch of the
manifold described by this co-ordinate system. Note
that throughout this paper we will split the potential
as V (φ) = V0 + ∆V (φ) where V0 = V (φfv) is the value
of the potential in the false vacuum (giving an eﬀective
cosmological constant) and ∆V (φ) is the rest of the po-
tential, shifted so that ∆V (φfv) = 0. The eﬀects of vary-
ing the Hubble rate are then included by varying V0 and

leaving ∆V (φ) unchanged.
In principle, however, this
neglects the fact that changing the background Hubble
rate would aﬀect the scale, µ, at which we should evalu-
ate the running couplings (see [14] for example) - taking
this into account would produce a diﬀerent scalar po-
tential, which is potentially an important eﬀect of a de
Sitter background. We will not consider the eﬀect of that
here, and instead simply consider the ﬂat-space Standard
Model potential.
To ensure that B is ﬁnite, the following boundary con-
ditions are imposed: (1) a(0) = 0 (this deﬁnes χ = 0 to
be the center of the bounce), (2) ˙φ(0) = 0 (to guaran-
tee smoothness of the solution at the a = 0 co-ordinate
singularity) and a ﬁnal condition (3) which depends on
the large χ behavior of a(χ). If a(χ → ∞) → ∞ (or a
non-zero constant) then the domain of χ is inﬁnite and
the space non-compact. In that case, a3(χ)V (φ(χ)) must
approach zero suﬃciently fast that B remains ﬁnite. Al-
ternatively, if ∃ ﬁnite χmax such that a(χmax) = 0, then
the manifold is compact and we require ˙φ(χmax) = 0 to
ensure smoothness at this second co-ordinate singularity.
It is straightforward to see that if V0 > 0, the former case
cannot have ﬁnite action - for V (φ) to approach zero, φ
must approach a zero of the potential, which is not in
general a stationary point of the potential, so the solu-
tion will not stay there. When V0 = 0, then the false
vacuum is a zero (and a stationary point) - in that case,
the former holds: a(χ → ∞) → ∞ and φ(χ → ∞) → φfv
suﬃciently fast that the action is ﬁnite (there is an addi-
tional complication in that the false vacuum action ap-
pears to be inﬁnite in the V0 → 0 limit, which is ad-
dressed in section VII). As a consequence of this, for
V0 > 0, ﬁnite action solutions will fall into the latter
category, and the boundary conditions can be summa-
rized as a(0) = 0, ˙φ(0) = ˙φ(χmax) = 0 where χmax > 0 is
deﬁned by a(χmax) = 0.

B. Types of Solutions

1. Hawking-Moss Solution

The simplest solution to Eqs.

(6) - (8) with these
boundary conditions is the Hawking-Moss solution[22],
which is a constant at the top of the barrier:

φ(χ) =φHM,

a(χ) =

sin(HHMχ)

where H 2

In the limit where |V (φHM) − V0| (cid:28) |V0|, then, this is
given approximately by:

(14)

which is the ratio of the energy requires to excite a

to the top of the barrier, over the
sphere of radius
HHM
Gibbons-Hawking temperature HHM
2π . This motivates a
thermal interpretation of the Hawking-Moss solution[25].

2. Coleman de Luccia Solution

There are also non-trivial O(4)-symmetric solutions
to the equations of motion, which may or may not
exist depending on the shape of the potential. Those
non-trivial solutions which cross the barrier once, and
are monotonic between φ(0) and φ(χmax) are known as
Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) bounces[19]. Such solutions
can be found by the overshoot/undershoot method,
which is described in the next section. Note that there
need not be only a single CdL solution - Weinberg
and Hackworth[33] found examples of potentials with
particularly ‘ﬂat’ barriers (as determined by the ratio
β = |V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φHM)|
) admitting multiple CdL type bounces
crossing the barrier only once. The existence of these
multiple bounces in the Standard Model is the subject
of this paper, and we emphasize that these are not the
same as oscillating solutions (discussed below).

H 2
0

3. Oscillating Solutions

It is also possible to consider solutions which cross the
barrier more than once before settling down to ˙φ(χmax) =
0, and these have been investigated by various authors
(see for example [33]). There is strong evidence, how-
ever, that these oscillating solutions possess multiple neg-
ative eigenvalues in their spectrum of linear ﬂuctuations
[34, 35]:
in particular, a bounce crossing the barrier N
times has exactly N negative modes. This leads to ques-
tions about their relevance for tunneling - Coleman orig-
inally argued that bounces with more than one nega-
tive eigenvalue in their ﬂuctuation spectrum do not con-
tribute to tunneling, since they correspond to stationary
points of the action which are not minima of the set of
tunneling paths through the barrier[27]. However, this
argument comes with the caveat that it does not directly
apply to case of tunneling in de Sitter space. Never-
theless, by rephrasing the de Sitter tunneling process in
terms of thermally assisted tunneling, Brown and Wein-
berg argued that this same restriction also applied to de
Sitter bounces[25]. Thus, oscillating solutions should not
be regarded as contributing the the tunneling rate. CdL

solutions, with a single negative eigenvalue, do contribute
to the decay rate.

III. THE CRITICAL THRESHOLD:
EIGENVALUES OF THE HAWKING-MOSS
INSTANTON

In this section we will explain the origins of the ‘crit-
ical threshold’ which determines whether Hawking-Moss
solutions contribute to vacuum decay. The ﬁrst step is to
understand the behavior of ‘non-instanton’ solutions to
Eqs. (6) and (7), that is, solutions which do not satisfy
the bounce boundary conditions.

A. Overshoot/Undershoots Solutions

Most values of φ(0) will not lead to solutions of the
equations of motion that satisfy the bounce boundary
conditions, and in fact result in divergent solutions.
These ‘non-instanton’ solutions can be categorized into
two types, with a precise deﬁnition given by Balek and
Demetrian[29]: overshoot solutions are those that diverge
on the opposite side of the barrier to that on which they
start, and undershoots diverge on the same side. These
solutions can then be further categorized by their ‘order’,
i.e. the number of times, N , that they cross the barrier
- Balek and Demetrian prove that between φ0 for a non-
instanton solution of order N and φ0 for a non-instanton
solution of order N + 1 there must always lie a bounce
solution that crosses N times.
Since we are only interested in the N = 1, CdL, solutions
in this paper, we adopt the slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition
that ‘undershoot’ solutions are those that cross ˙φ = 0
before encountering the second a = 0 singularity (note
that such undershoots could also conceivably be ‘oscil-
lating’ bounce solutions if they then go on to possess
˙φ coinciding with the a = 0 singularity,
another zero of
but since we are only interested in CdL bounces in this
paper, we classify these as undershoots too). Solutions
which encounter the a = 0 coordinate singularity with-
out ever encountering ˙φ = 0 are classiﬁed as ‘overshoot’
solutions. Using this deﬁnition singles out the CdL type
solutions, while ignoring the oscillating solutions.

B. Eigenvalues of the Hawking-Moss Solution

An attractive feature of the Hawking-Moss solution is
that it is possible to compute the spectrum of eigenval-
ues for linearized ﬁeld-space ﬂuctuations around it an-
alytically. The scalar ﬂuctuations satisfy an equation
determined by the second functional derivative of the ac-
tion:

− ∇µ∇µδφ + V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φHM)δφ = 0,

(15)

5

where ∇µ∇µ is ﬁxed in the constant 4-sphere background
of the Hawking-Moss solution. Note that in principle one
should consider metric ﬂuctuations as well. However, it
is always possible to choose a gauge in which only the
scalar ﬂuctuations are relevant for computing the eigen-
value spectrum[28, 36]. The solutions to this are 4-sphere
spherical harmonics (Gegenbauer functions) with eigen-
values:

λN = −V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φHM) + N (N + 3)H 2

HM.

(16)

As with all bounces, the N = 0 mode is negative - this
is what gives an imaginary contribution to the vacuum
energy and a resulting vacuum instability. Of interest
here is the N = 1 mode, which changes sign when:

V0 + ∆V (φHM)
3M 2
P

−

V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φHM)
4

= 0.

(17)

This deﬁnes a critical false vacuum Hubble rate, Hcrit, or
critical V0crit:

H 2

crit =

V0crit
3M 2
P

= −

V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φHM)
4

−

∆V (φHM)
3M 2
P

,

(18)

below which the Hawking-Moss solution always has mul-
tiple negative eigenvalues, and thus is expected not to
contribute to tunneling.
This critical threshold is signiﬁcant for tunneling in de
Sitter space because it appears to be a value for which
there is qualitative change in the behavior of the non-
trivial (CdL) solutions. It has been discussed as a possi-
ble bound for the existence of CdL bounces in the form of
the condition β > 4, where β = |V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φHM)|/H 2
0 for CdL
bounces to exist[37], however, it’s actual role is somewhat
weaker than this[29], and in fact CdL solutions have been
found in potentials violating it[33].
The boundary conditions mentioned in the previous sec-
tion describe a two point boundary value problem for
˙φ(0) = ˙φ(χmax) = 0, which can be
the scalar ﬁeld:
solved by shooting. The procedure is to pick a value
of φ(0) = φ0, and classify the solution as (1) an ‘under-
shoot’ or ‘overshoot’, as discussed in section III A. Balek
and Demetrian[29] show that between φ0 leading to an
undershoot and φ0 leading to an overshoot, there must
always lie some φ0 which leads to a bounce solution, by
continuity. It is always possible to argue that φ0 starting
suﬃciently close to the false vacuum leads to an over-
shoot (see appendix B); Balek and Demetrian showed
that one can establish the existence of an undershoot
for φ0 suﬃciently close to the barrier, if V0 < V0crit.
This implies a CdL bounce must exist for V0 < V0crit.
Above this threshold, existence is not guaranteed, but
also not ruled out. Note that it is possible to have no
CdL solutions at all: Balek and Demetrian showed that
V (φ) < − 3M 2
for some φ in the barrier is a neces-
sary (but not suﬃcient) condition for the existence of a
bounce.
We will summarize Balek and Demetrian’s argument
here, as it is pertinent to understanding the role of V0crit.

Consider a solution with φ0 arbitrarily close to φHM, such
that the scalar ﬁeld equation can be treated as approx-
imately linear, and a(χ) ≈ sin(HHMχ)
. Then the scalar
ﬁeld satisﬁes:

(19)

where ∆φ = φ − φHM. The transformation u =
cos(HHMχ) turns this into Gegenbauer’s diﬀerential
equation, and this fact can also be used to derive the
eigenspectrum of Eq. (16). For the case at hand, how-
ever, the Gegenbauer functions for a given ∆φ0 can be
expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function:

merge with the Hawking-Moss solution as V0 → V0crit
from below, or (2), there are at least two solutions on
the interval (φfv, φHM), one of which smoothly merges
with the Hawking-Moss solution at V0crit, and the other
does not. The main conclusion of this paper is that the
Standard Model eﬀective potential ﬁts into the rather pe-
culiar second category - above V0crit there are multiple,
distinct, non-oscillating, CdL-like bounce solutions with
the same number of turning points.
This behavior makes the question of the vacuum decay
rate far from simple, as it implies that pairs of bounce
solutions can emerge and disappear as V0 is varied, mak-
ing it diﬃcult to prove that one has found the lowest
action solution for a given V0. Indeed, ﬁnding all the so-
lutions becomes an extremely diﬃcult task, because wide
ranges of φ0 which appear to be all overshoots or all un-
dershoots when sampled can (and, as we will show, do)
contain hidden narrow regions of solutions with the op-
posite character, and associated bounce solutions which
are easily missed by a cursory scan.

Using standard identities for the hypergeometric func-
tion, the solution near the second co-ordinate singularity
at χmax = π

is, asymptotically:

The nature of this solution (overshoot or undershoot) is
determined by the sign with which it diverges relative to
the sign of ∆φ0, and thus by the sign of the cosine in the
numerator. An overshoot will diverge on the opposite
side of the barrier to where it starts, thus, ∆φ
diverges
∆φ0
to negative inﬁnity, while undershoots, which fall back
before diverging, diverge as ∆φ
→ +∞. Consequently,
∆φ0
as V0 approaches V0crit from below, all the solutions are
undershoots, but as it approaches from above, all the so-
lutions are overshoots.
This is why CdL solutions are not guaranteed above
V0crit: both a solution arbitrarily close to the false vac-
uum and a solution arbitrarily close to the top of the
barrier are overshoots, so unless there is an undershoot
somewhere in between them, all solutions between the
false vacuum and the top of the barrier are overshoots
If there is an undershoot
and no CdL solution exists.
between the false vacuum and the barrier for V0 > V0crit,
however, then we are in an unusual situation, because
starting with φ0 at the false vacuum and moving towards
the top of the barrier, we must transition at least once
to a region of undershoots, and then back to a region
of overshoots. Both these transitions require a separate
bounce solution to exist, indicating that there are now at
least two CdL-type bounces.
We can thus conclude one of two things: (1) there are no
undershoots on the interval (φfv, φHM), and since the CdL
solution which necessarily exists for V0 < V0crit should
vary smoothly with V0, we conclude it must smoothly

IV. NUMERICAL METHODS

The method of ﬁnding bounce solutions chosen
was the overshoot/undershoot technique proposed by
Coleman[24]. This is a form of non-linear shooting, which
consists of picking a value of φ0 (which is left unspeci-
ﬁed by the boundary conditions) and checking whether
the solution is an overshoot or an undershoot (see sec-
tion III A for a deﬁnition). As discussed in the previous
section, in curved space it can be shown that between an
overshoot and undershoot solution there always exists a
bounce solution[29]: thus bounce solutions can be found
by bisection. This approach is chosen both for its sim-
plicity of implementation, and for the fact that insight
into the nature of the solutions can be gained through
‘scan-plots’ like ﬁg. 5.
A non-trivial feature of the solutions is the fact that the
initial conditions are speciﬁed at the a(0) = 0 co-ordinate
singularity. This can be dealt with via a Taylor expan-
sion to a small radial coordinate χ, easily derived from
the equations of motion:

φ(χ) ≈φ0 +

a(χ) ≈χ −

(22)

(23)

There is a speciﬁc feature of the overshoot-undershoot
procedure that is unique to the case of de Sitter bounces:
in ﬂat space, and in the V0 = 0 case, the bounce is in a
sense ‘one-sided’ because it satisﬁes the boundary condi-
tion φ(χ → ∞) → φfv. In the de-Sitter case, however,
the condition ˙φ(χmax) = 0 implies that there is another
unknown parameter, φend = φ(χmax). This can be found
in a similar way to φ0 simply by applying the overshoot-
undershoot procedure on the false vacuum side of the bar-
rier (since φend must lie in the range φfv ≤ φend ≤ φHM).

The two sides of the solution can then be patched to-
gether to obtain the entire solution. We will denote
these two halves of the solution as the ‘true-vacuum
side’ solution and the ‘false-vacuum side’ solution. The
false vacuum side must be ﬂipped by the transformation
χ → χmax − χ in order to patch together with the true
vacuum side. The matching point at which the solutions
meet can be chosen arbitrarily, but we choose it to be the
point where ˙a = 0 (this always exists suﬃciently close to
a de Sitter bounce, because otherwise the bounce would
be non-compact and have inﬁnite action). This proce-
dure has the advantage of avoiding the a(χmax) = 0 coor-
dinate singularity when computing the bounce solution,
since the solutions are integrated from each side and meet
in the middle: integration is always performed out of the
singularity (this is important, because integrating into a
singularity is numerically unstable, due to the negative
friction term in Eq. (6) when ˙a < 0, leading to exponen-
tial growth of any small errors).
These methods all apply to ﬁnding bounces in general,
but there is also a signiﬁcant challenge which is not
present ﬂat space calculations - this is the fact that Eq.
(10) contains a divergent term in the V0 → 0 limit. If
the action is to approach the V0 = 0 result, which is
ﬁnite, then calculation of the decay exponent, B, must
involve a cancellation between two large (and ultimately
divergent) numbers. This poses a problem for calcula-
tions performed at double precision.
In the literature,
this problem is usually avoided by choosing the ﬁxed
background approximation, that is, assuming that a(χ)
takes the same form for the bounce solution as it does in
the false vacuum (a(χ) = sin(H0χ)/H0), which is equiv-
alent to ignoring the eﬀects of back-reaction from the
bounce solution on the metric. We choose not to use the
ﬁxed background approximation in this paper, because
the depth of the Standard Model potential compared to
reasonable inﬂationary scales is large. Consequently we
have developed techniques for ﬁnding the bounce solu-
tions taking into account all the back-reaction correc-
tions. In particular we do two things: (1) use arbitrary
precision numbers, rather than double precision numbers,
to perform the calculation (the calculations in this paper
use 100 decimal places of precision) and (2) re-write Eq.
(10) in such a way that cancellations of large numbers
are avoided where possible.
The re-writing of the action we chose is the following: we
split it into three parts, B = B1 + B2 + B3, where

, and δaH0 (χ) is deﬁned by:

a(χ) =

1
H0

sin(H0(χmax − χ)) + δaH0(χ).

(27)

In other words, δaH0(χ) represents the deviation of a(χ)
from the false-vacuum-solution scale factor. Note that
there is some freedom here - δaH0 (χ) could have been
deﬁned as a(χ) = 1
sin(H0χ) + δaH0(χ), or any other
H0
phase shift of this. However, as we will see in section VII,
Eq. (27) is the deﬁnition that agrees with the deviation
of a(χ) from the false vacuum solution in the V0 → 0
limit. This makes it the most natural choice.
B3 is an analytic term, and like B2 it arises due to the
diﬀering sizes of the bounce solution 4-sphere geometry
and the false vacuum 4-sphere. As such, B2 and B3 are
both expected to be very small if the ﬁxed background
approximation works well. Although it is not obvious,
B2 and B3 can be shown to vanish in the V0 → 0 limit
if there exists a family of solutions that smoothly ap-
proaches the V0 = 0 solution. This is discussed in section
VII.
B1 and B2 are evaluated as if they were separate compo-
nents of the diﬀerential equation:

(29)

Notice that Eq.
(25) in that it
(29) diﬀers from Eq.
uses sin(H0χ) instead of sin(H0(χmax − χ)). This is be-
cause χmax is not known a priori until the solution has
been computed. However, because we use the method
of integrating from both sides, the correct δaH0 (χ) and
sin(H0(χmax − χ)) terms are obtained when integrating
from the false vacuum side of the barrier, for which it is
necessary to transform χ → χmax − χ to patch together
with the true vacuum side of the solution. However, the
procedure gives the wrong δa for the true vacuum half:
the relationship between the correct δaH0(χ) and the one
obtained from the true-vacuum side of the bounce is just
a diﬀerence of two sin functions once χmax is determined:

1
H0

δaH0(χ) = δatv
H0

(χ)+

(sin(H0χ)−sin(H0(χmax −χ))).

(30)
The result of integrating B2 from the true-vacuum side
of the barrier up to the matching point is then also sim-
ply related to the the contribution it should give (with
the correct δaH0(χ)) by a simple analytically calculable
function of χmax and the matching point. Thus in princi-
ple the fact that χmax is not known a-priori doesn’t pose
a signiﬁcant problem, as the contribution to B2 obtained
can be easily transformed into the correct contribution.
In practice, however, because δaH0(χ) is frequently small
compared to the sinusoidal terms, there are sometimes

8

situations where doing this leads to signiﬁcant inaccu-
racies due to numerical errors in the computed value of
χmax. Such a situation is fortunately easy to detect be-
cause it shows up a discontinuity in δaH0 (χ) when the
already correct false-vacuum side of the solution and the
corrected true-vacuum side of the solution are patched to-
gether. For such situations, it is generally more accurate
to compute the whole of B2 using the nearest undershoot
solution computed from the false vacuum half of the solu-
tion alone, integrating all the way up to ˙φ(χmax) = 0 (un-
dershoot solutions are more reliably close to the bounce
solution than overshoots, because they can be terminated
at the ˙φ = 0 point before they diverge, while overshoot
solutions are generally not as easy to identify until they
have started diverging).

V. EXAMPLE - POLYNOMIAL POTENTIAL

We will ﬁrst consider an example of de Sitter bounces
in a simple polynomial potential.The potential we use is:

λ4 = −1, λ6 = +1, m2 = 0.1M 2

in this case choosing λ4 = −1, λ6 = +1, m2 = 0.1M 2
and M = MP, which gives the potential in ﬁgure 1.

P, H0crit = 0.0705MP.

For these values, the critical Hubble rate is at V0crit =
0.01482M 4
3, the over-
shoot/undershoot structure of solutions for various val-
ues of φ(0) is plotted, so as to determine the spectrum
of bounce solutions for diﬀerent V0. This shows the ex-
pected behavior; above V0crit, there are no undershoot
solutions at all, and thus no CdL solution exists.

In ﬁg.

The bounce solution can then be computed by means
of a binary search on the boundaries between overshoot
and undershoot regions, as discussed in section IV. Ex-
ample solutions are shown in ﬁg. 2, which shows how
the solutions approach the Hawking-Moss solution sit-
ting at the top of the barrier as V0 is raised past the
critical value. With increasing V0, the solutions decrease
in amplitude, which can be interpreted as thermal eﬀects
becoming more and more important compared to quan-
tum tunneling eﬀects[25].

The resulting decay exponent, B, is plotted in ﬁgure 4.
This shows a fairly typical behaviour for “well behaved”
potentials - below the critical threshold, there is a unique
CdL bounce whose action approaches the ﬂat false vac-
uum (V0 = 0) case as V0 → 0. At the critical threshold,
it appears that the CdL action merges with the Hawking-
Moss solution, just as the solutions appear to do in ﬁg.
2. To check whether V0crit really is the point at which
the CdL bounce merges with the Hawking-Moss solution,
we plot in ﬁg. 4 the diﬀerence between the Hawking-
Moss and CdL actions for a give V0, in the vicinity of
V0crit. Above V0crit the overshoot-undershoot procedure
yields the Hawking-Moss solution, because no CdL so-
lution exists, thus the diﬀerence is zero. Below V0crit,

FIG. 2: Plots of the CdL solutions for various values of
V0 in the polynomial potential, showing how they

V0 → V0crit. For reference, V0crit = 0.014822M 4
P.

it can be seen that the diﬀerence between the decay ex-
ponents smoothly approaches zero at V0crit. Note that
for V0 = V0crit, it is known from linear analysis that the
N = 1 eigenfunction of the Hawking-Moss satisﬁes the
bounce boundary conditions[29].

threshold at V0crit = 0.01482M 4

top of the barrier: above it these solution disappear and all the solutions found are overshoots. This implies that no
CdL-type solution exists above H0crit, and the Hawking-Moss solution is the only contributor.

BOUNCES IN THE STANDARD MODEL

To study the situation in the Standard Model, consider

the following approximation to the eﬀective potential:

V (φ) =

λ(φ)
4

φ4.

(32)

Where λ(µ) is the Higgs self coupling at energy scale µ.
In this example we use three loop running of the Stan-
dard Model couplings. The potential uses a piecewise
polynomial approximation identical to the approach
described in a previous paper[9]. This admittedly has
shortcomings - a more correct treatment would modify
the scale µ to include curvature terms[14], but for the
purposes of this paper we will consider the ﬂat space
potential.

Performing the numerical calculations with
V0 > 0, however, poses signiﬁcant numerical challenges
compared to the V0 = 0 case, which are addressed
in the section IV. One issue of physical relevance is
the large range of scales in the Standard Model - the
behavior of bounces with V0 = 0 is dominated by a
scale just below the Planck scale[38], but for the central
values of the Higgs boson and top quark masses, the
barrier lies at around 1010GeV.
In this paper we ﬁx
Mh = 125.15GeV, Mt = 173.34GeV and consider
only variations of V0. This gives a barrier scale of
φbar = 5.110 × 109GeV, and a critical Hubble rate
H0crit = 1.1931 × 108GeV, (V0crit = 7.203 × 10−21M4
P).
If the Standard Model behaved like the polynomial
potential, therefore,
it might be expected that CdL
bounces would dominate the decay rate below H0crit
and Hawking-Moss solutions would dominate above this.
In fact, as we will see, the behavior is somewhat diﬀerent.

First, we plot the overshoot/overshoot structure in
5). To understand the
logarithmic space (see ﬁg.
structure, we compute the end value φ(χmax) for a given
set of points, φ(0). The ‘end-value’ χmax > 0 is deﬁned
by either (1) the point where ˙φ = 0 if the solution is
an undershoot, or (2) the point at which the solution
crosses the ‘overshoot threshold’ with positive ˙φ2 if it
is an overshoot: either the false vacuum or the true
vacuum, depending on which side of the barrier the
solution starts on. Note that in the Standard Model the
true vacuum is many orders of magnitude larger than
the Planck scale, and thus it is necessary for practical
reasons to impose a smaller cutoﬀ at which a solution is
declared to be an overshoot:
for these calculations we
chose this to be the Planck scale, but we have checked
that the classiﬁcation is not sensitive to this. The result
of this will be a curve which possesses discontinuities
at the boundary between a region of undershoots and
a region of overshoots. The undershoot solutions,
in
this case, more closely approximate the true bounce
solution because they are terminated before hitting the
co-ordinate singularity; their φ(χmax) value is of greatest
interest. Figure 5 shows these overshoot/undershoot

10

structures for H0 < H0crit and H0 > H0crit. We select
these two value of H0 in particular because they are
very close to the critical Hubble rate, and illustrate that
a dramatic change occurs there. The end φ(χmax) and
starting points, φ(0), of the solutions associated to each
overshoot/undershoot transition are plotted as lines in-
terpolating between the diﬀerent overshoot/undershoot
boundary discontinuities.
These plots indicate that there is signiﬁcant structure
present, especially above H0crit. This is the ﬁrst hint that
the Standard Model potential is not a typical potential.
For H0 < H0crit, the structure is relatively simple; there
is a single discontinuity around φ(0) ∼ 10−12Mp, and
another one at φ(0) ∼ 0.17Mp. Everything in between
these points is an undershoot, and everything outside
them is an overshoot (note that φ(χmax) for overshoots
through the false vacuum are not shown on these plots
because the false vacuum is chosen to be at φ = 0,
placing it at −∞ in logarithmic space). As expected,
if we deﬁne the function φend(φ0) = φφ0(χmax), where
φφ0 (χ) is the solution for a given value of φ0, then
the result is a smooth function between these two
discontinuities.
The situation for H0 > H0crit is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.
We plot in ﬁg. 6 the region around the barrier and in
ﬁg. 7 the region around the top of the CdL bounce, both
of which show signiﬁcant changes.

The region around the barrier shows very ﬁne struc-
ture, with several more discontinuities in φmax(φ0).
These discontinuities correspond to narrow regions of φ0
for which there are overshoots, surrounded by under-
shoots, and vice-versa. Recall that it was shown ana-
lytically that solutions suﬃciently close to the barrier
are always overshoots for H0 > H0crit. At ﬁrst glance,
it appears as though all the solutions for φ0 < φHM are
undershoots, although this analytic result clearly holds
for φ0 > φHM. However, a closer inspection reveals that
going very close to the barrier does in fact produce over-
shoots eventually (see ﬁgure 8).
Equally interesting is the structure around the top of the
expected CdL bounce. In ﬁg. 5, there appears to be a
very rapid movement towards ∼ 10−12Mp (the value of
the φ at the end of the false vacuum side of the solu-
tion). However, closer inspection in ﬁgure 7 shows that
this variation is smooth, with the exception of a nar-
row region of overshoots among the mostly undershoot
solutions. Since every overshoot/undershoot transition
boundary implies the existence of a bounce, there are at
least three bounces that start near φ(0) ∼ 0.17MP. The
solutions must transition back to overshoots on reaching
the barrier (since analytically solutions linearized about
the barrier are known to be overshoots for H0 > H0crit),
thus a fourth solution necessarily exists. This solution is
small amplitude and mostly conﬁned to the top of the
barrier. Thus, unlike for H0 < H0crit, there are actu-
ally four non-trivial solutions in addition to the Hawking-
Moss solution.

FIG. 5: Scan through possible φ(0) values in the Standard Model eﬀective potential, giving the resulting φ(χmax) at
which ˙φ(χmax) = 0 if the solution is an undershoot. Straight lines are drawn between the start and ends of each
bounce solution at an overshoot/undershoot boundary. When crossing the critical threshold of

H0crit = 1.1931 × 108GeV, (V0crit = 7.203 × 10−21M4

P), there is a dramatic change in the nature of the non-instanton

solutions which start close to the barrier (region A, see ﬁgure 6), and for those near the top of the CdL bounce
(region B, see ﬁgure 7).

Figure 9 shows example bounce solutions for V0 = 7.210×
10−21M 4
P (H0 = 1.1937 × 108GeV), which is just above
the critical threshold. There are four solutions. Table I
shows their end points and associated initial data com-
pared to the relevant Hawking-Moss solution. For com-
parison, we show the same calculation assuming a ﬁxed
de Sitter background, neglecting the back-reaction terms,
in table II Note that many of these initial conditions dif-
fer only in the sixth decimal place or more. To verify that
this is not due to numerical error, the presence of an over-
shoot/undershoot boundary for each bounce solution was
tested using the Fehlberg78 Runge-Kutta method[39] at
relative tolerance of εrel = 10−30 and absolute tolerance
of εabs = 10−80 using arbitrary precision numbers with
up to 100 decimal places of precision to reduce rounding
error. Note that the extremely low absolute tolerance
is only necessary near to the co-ordinate singularity at
χ = 0; for most of the solution’s range the relative toler-
ance is far more important than the absolute tolerance for
controlling numerical precision. Adaptive Runge-Kutta
methods such as this vary the step size such that the
error estimate ∆y for solution component y satisﬁes:

|∆y| < |εrely + εabs|

(33)

at each step. This level of precision makes it easy to dis-
tinguish between solutions such as ‘CdL solution 3’ and

‘CdL solution 4’ in table I which start extremely close
together, but terminate in very diﬀerent places. The fact
that the overshoot/undershoot boundaries persist when
the relative tolerance is increased suggests that the eﬀect
is real, not a numerical artifact. Of course, the only
solution of relevance for quantum tunneling is the solu-
tion with the smallest Euclidean action. In this case, the
calculation appears to show that the largest amplitude
solution (i.e.
largest φ(0) on the true vacuum side and
smallest φ(χmax) on the false vacuum side) has the lowest
action. Thus the additional solutions, while interesting,
are exponentially suppressed and do not contribute to
the decay rate. However, this may not be the case for all
values of H0 or potential shapes.
Note that for even larger values of H0, even more solu-
tions than these four begin to appear, which makes the
process of ﬁnding and classifying them even more com-
plicated, as it is diﬃcult to guarantee that all solutions
for a given H0 have been found. The solutions found cur-
rently have been of higher action than the largest ampli-
tude CdL solution, which most closely resembles the ﬂat
space bounce, but the existence of lower action solutions
cannot be ruled out. If so, such solutions could poten-
tially dominate vacuum decay at large Hubble rates. The
existence of multiple solutions also raises the question of
which solution, if any, approaches the V0 = 0 bounce as

V0 → 0. The data in ﬁg. 5 suggest that this would be
the largest amplitude solution, since this most closely re-
sembles the unique bounce found for H0 < H0crit, and
the other solutions appear to be related to narrow over-
shoot or undershoot regions. The behavior of this family
of solutions in the V0 → 0 limit is discussed in section
VII.

A. Vacuum decay rate as a function of H0

The existence of extra solutions for H0 > H0crit is a
signiﬁcant complication to the question of the vacuum de-
cay rate for a given H0. To make progress, we conjecture
that the largest amplitude non-trivial solution, if it exists,
will always have the smallest action, and thus dominate
the decay rate. This seems plausible for two reasons: (1)
the bounce of largest amplitude has the smallest φ value
far outside its center, on the false-vacuum side. At ﬁrst
glance, it might be assumed therefore that Eq. 10 pre-
dicts a higher action since V (φ) is smaller in this exterior
region. However, this naive conclusion neglects eﬀects
coming from a3(χ). As it turns out, these eﬀects more
than cancel out the decrease in V (φ) and the eﬀect of
having φ(χ) closer to the false vacuum is the decrease the
action, in general. Reason (2) applies mainly to the small
amplitude bounce: for H0 > H0crit, the second eigenvalue

for linear ﬂuctuations about the Hawking-Moss solution
is positive. This eigen-ﬂuctuation corresponds to solu-
tions which ﬂuctuate about the top of the barrier, at a
linearized level, with a shape similar to that of the non-
linear solution which is close to the top of the barrier.
Thus, it might be expected that this non-linear solution
is a continuation in this ‘direction’ of ﬁeld conﬁguration
space, and has a larger action than the Hawking-Moss
solution due to the positive eigenvalue. In order for non-
linear solutions to have smaller action than the Hawking-
Moss, we would expect to encounter a stationary point in
between, and since this bounce is presumably the closest
stationary point in this ’direction’, it would be expected
to have larger action.
Both these arguments are admittedly rather hand-waving
- the ﬁrst assumes that the competition between changes
in V (φ) and a3(χ) is always ‘won’ by a3(χ) in such a way
as to decrease the action for larger amplitude bounces.
The second relies on arguing that the action of non-linear
solutions about the top of the barrier should behave qual-
itatively similar to that of linearized solutions, which is
by no means certain without knowing the full structure
of stationary points (including, possibly, non O(4) sym-
metric stationary points).
However, assuming this conjecture holds, it is relatively
easy to extract only the largest amplitude solution for a
given H0. The point at which the Hawking-Moss solution

tion to say that the decay rate exponent is the same as
the V0 = 0 case for H0 < H0cross, and the same as the
Hawking-Moss decay exponent for H0 > H0cross. As can
be seen from ﬁgure 10, there is no special behavior at
H0crit, unlike in the polynomial case considered.

VII. FLAT FALSE VACUUM LIMIT

As mentioned earlier in the paper, there is a signiﬁcant
problem in the V0 → 0 limit, in that the decay exponent
arises due to a cancellation of two large numbers:

B =

24π2M 4
P
V0

− 2π2

(cid:90) χmax

dχa3(χ)V (φ(χ)).

(34)

The ﬁrst term diverges as V0 → 0, but the result is
known to be ﬁnite there, thus the second term must also
diverge in such a way that the overall result is ﬁnite.
This means that computing each part separately is
highly inaccurate, as a result of round oﬀ error. A simi-
lar problem occurs in the limit where V0 (cid:29) |∆V (φHM)|,
for which Eq. (13) becomes inaccurate, a problem which
can be cured by using a Taylor series approximation.
The way this problem is solved has already been
discussed in section IV. Here we attempt to provide
an answer to a reasonable question - what happens to
bounce solutions in the V0 → 0 limit? Does the decay
exponent, B, smoothly approach the V0 = 0 value? For
both the polynomial potential and the standard model
potential considered in this paper, the answer appears
to be yes, at least at the numerical level. We would
like to put this question of somewhat ﬁrmer grounds
analytically, however.
To do this, we analyze the conditions under which

begins to dominate is then the value of H0 at which the
Hawking-Moss solution and the largest amplitude CdL
solution have equal action. We subsequently denote this
value as H0cross. The total action is plotted in ﬁgure 10,
giving H0cross = 1.931×108GeV(V0 = 1.887×10−20M4
P).
One immediate observation is how ﬂat the action curve
appears.
In fact, it does slope very slowly (see ﬁgure
10). In light of this, it is a reasonably good approxima-

CdL solutions are numbered by order of the proximity of their false vacuum end-value to the false vacuum, thus
CdL 1 always corresponds to the largest amplitude solution.

B1, B2, and B3, discussed in section IV converge to
the V0 = 0 result. We ﬁrst need to state precisely
what this means: naively, we would say that the CdL
bounce should approach the V0 = 0 bounce as V0 → 0.
However, since there are potentially many CdL bounces,
and bounces for diﬀerent V0 are not deﬁned on the
same manifold, it is not immediately obvious if there
is any meaning to talk about the ‘same’ bounce at
diﬀerent values of V0. For the purposes of this paper,
we will merely assume there exists a sequence of bounce
solutions with diﬀerent V0 whose limit as V0 → 0 is the
V0 = 0 bounce. The question is then whether the action
of this sequence approaches the V0 = 0 action if the
solutions approach the V0 = 0 bounce.

A. Vanishing of B3

The ﬁrst thing to note here is that provided χmax →
∞, φH0(χ) → φ0(χ), aH0 (χ) → a0(χ) smoothly (where
φH0(χ), aH0 (χ) describe the bounce solution for a given
H0 and φ0(χ), a0(χ) describe the V0 = 0 solution), then
B1 → B0, the ﬂat-false-vacuum decay exponent. Thus,
for the limit to be smooth, both B2 and B3 must vanish
in the V0 → 0 limit. The condition for B3 to vanish is

the simplest to establish, so we will consider that ﬁrst:

B3 =

which is a ‘near cancellation’ of the divergent false vac-
uum action. Note this equation alone is not guaranteed
to give a ﬁnite answer - it depends on the χmax(H0) func-
tion (implicit in writing down this function is the as-
sumption that the aforementioned sequence of bounces
vary smoothly). For B3 to vanish, the condition is that
1+cos(H0χmax(H0)) → 0 faster than H0, which is equiv-
alent to saying:

lim
H0→0

H0χmax(H0) = (2n + 1)π, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

(36)

Note that since φ0(χ) → 0 as χ → ∞ for the H0 = 0
solution, and φH0(χ) is assumed to smoothly approach
φ0(χ), the majority of the [0, χmax] domain will have neg-
ligible V (φ(χ)), and thus one expects χmax to be similar

over the majority of the domain, which is not the case
if the solution is smoothly approaching φ0(χ), which is
approximately zero over the majority of its (inﬁnite) do-
main). Consequently, we expect to be able to write down
a power series:

χmax(H0) =

(37)

where αi are some undetermined constants, at least in
some neighborhood of H0 = 0. In fact, it is possible to
determine α0 from the ﬂat-false vacuum solution alone.
In that limit, one ﬁnds the scale factor, a0(χ), to be:

a0(χ) = lim
H0→0

(cid:18) 1
H0

sin(H0(χmax(H0) − χ))

+ δa0(χ)

(cid:19)

= χ − α0 + δa0(χ).

(38)

Note that because of the way it is deﬁned, δa0(χ) → 0 as
χ → ∞ (this wouldn’t have been the case if the δaH0 (χ)
splitting had been done diﬀerently, which is why Eq. 27
is the most ‘natural’ choice). This means:

α0 = lim
χ→∞

(χ − a0(χ)).

(39)

This is in fact a fairly stable numerical calculation to do.
For the values of the top quark and Higgs mass used in
this paper, we ﬁnd α0 = −0.2559M −1
P . The fact that this
is negative is expected - it is a consequence of the fact
that the bounce solution has negative curvature in the in-
terior of the bounce due to the potential being negative
there. This results in a (very) brief period of exponential
growth of a0(χ) in the interior of the bounce, meaning
that at large χ, a0(χ) is always slightly larger than χ and

goes as a0(χ) ∼ χ − α0. This translates into a negative
α0, which can be interpreted physically as characterizing
the ‘net’ back-reaction of the bounce.
Of course, this only gives the condition for B3 to be ﬁnite
in the H0 → 0 limit. It does not prove that the requisite
one-parameter family of solutions exists. However, if it
does, then the condition limH0→0 H0χmax(H0) = π must
be satisﬁed, otherwise the action of the family of bounces
diverges.
To ascertain whether we expect this to be the case, con-
sider changing to a co-ordinate system x = H0χ.
In
this co-ordinate system, as φH0 (x) → φ0(x), it becomes
an inﬁnitely narrow spike because φ0(χ) approaches a
ﬁxed ‘width’ (e.g, χ at which the bounces reaches half
its maximum value), implying that the width in the x
co-ordinates of φ0(x) decreases with decreasing H0 and
is proportional to H0. The scale factor equation in this
co-ordinate system becomes:

a(cid:48)(cid:48) = −

(40)

For a ‘narrow spike’ solution, φ(cid:48)2 = ∆V (φ) = 0 over most
of the range of integration, increasingly so in the H0 → 0
limit. Thus, far outside the bounce, the solution satisﬁes
a(cid:48)(cid:48) = −a with solution a(x) = sin(x + ϕ)/H0. The phase
ϕ is ﬁxed by asymptotic matching to the interior solu-
tion. Since the region in which the interior solution is
not negligible shrinks to zero in the H0 → 0 limit, then
so does ϕ and the domain size approaches π, implying
limH0→0 H0χmax(H0) = π.

The question then becomes whether such a family ex-
ists. We have not been able to provide a satisfactory
formal proof of this, however, at least in the potentials

ble rates a long way below the scale of the CdL bounce
itself. From an intuitive point of view this makes sense
- the Standard Model bubble nucleation process occurs
on scales only an order of magnitude smaller than the
Planck scale[8, 9], and so barely sees the curvature asso-
ciated to the Hubble rate unless it is also close to that
scale. Since the Planck results imply a tensor-to-scalar
ratio r < 0.11[40] , corresponding to H0 < 7.9×1013GeV,
it should be a good approximation for most inﬂationary
models to use the V0 = 0 bounce for Hubble rates be-
fore the crossing point, H0 < H0cross = 1.931 × 108GeV ,
and the Hawking-Moss (or Fokker-Planck) analysis above
this threshold. This assumes, of course, that none of the
extra solutions which appear have lower action than the
largest amplitude CdL or Hawking-Moss solution. Ne-
glecting the weak H0 dependence and assuming a con-
stant B(H0) = Bfv, the approximate location of the
cross-over is:

The emergence of extra solutions in the Standard Model
potential
immediately complicates calculations of the
vacuum decay rate. Ostensibly, the bounce with low-
est action should always dominate. However, this may
not be straightforward to identify, as there appears to be
no obvious way of predicting how many CdL solutions
are expected for a given Hubble rate. As the Hubble
rate was raised in our analysis, we found that more and
more solutions appeared. Although for H0 < H0crit only
a single CdL bounce and the Hawking-Moss instanton
were found, the existence of narrow regions of overshoots
among regions which otherwise look like undershoots, or
vice versa (ﬁg. 7 is a typical example) for H0 > H0crit
means that we cannot rule out the existence of other, un-
known, solutions for any H0. We hypothesize that these
extra solutions only appear for H0 > H0crit, but can oﬀer
no proof of this, and it could well turn out to be false.
In all the cases we studied, the action of the extra solu-
tions was found to be larger than the largest amplitude
CdL solution (which is the solution we hypothesize to be
in the family that continuously deforms into the V0 = 0
solution, with other solutions disappearing as H0 is low-
ered). We hypothesize, therefore, that this largest am-
plitude solution always has the lowest action, and thus
the other solutions should be irrelevant to vacuum de-
cay. There are other reasons to think that this is the
case: the existence and form of these solutions probably
depends strongly on the shape of the potential. How-
ever, the precise shape of the potential is not a gauge
invariant property; only physical observables such as the
locations of its stationary points are[41]. It may be the
case, therefore, that the existence and nature of these
solutions depends on the choice of gauge: in which case
they may not be physical and we would not expect them
to change the decay rate be possessing a lower action,

we have considered, it appears to be plausible. Figure 11
shows H0χmax(H0) − π for a family of CdL solutions in
the Standard Model eﬀective potential, plotted against
the analytic prediction for χmax(H0) in Eq. (36). The
slope and y-intercept of the resulting line are consistent
with satisfying the H0χmax(H0) − π → 0 relationship, to
within the error of the coeﬃcients of a linear model. The
least squares regression ﬁt H0χmax(H0) − π = a + bH0
gives, for these data, a = (−0.1 ± 1.4) × 10−16 and
b = −0.255894 ± 0.0000025M −1
P . This gives a limit for
H0χmax(H0) − π consistent with 0 and a slope consis-
tent with α0 = −0.2559, as extracted from the H0 = 0
solution. On this basis, we regard it as extremely plau-
sible (though still unproven) that there exists a family
of bounce solutions satisfying the requisite condition on
χmax, at least in the Standard Model potential.

VIII. DISCUSSION

The most important observation is that the Standard
Model is not a typical potential: there is no continuous
transition between CdL instantons and Hawking-Moss in-
stantons as occurs in some model potentials. This may
call into question arguments based on direct analogy be-
tween the Standard Model and simple models, as it is
clear the behavior of tunneling in the Standard Model is
strongly dependent on the shape of the potential. How-
ever, our results suggest that the dependence of CdL
bounces on the Hubble rate is extremely weak for Hub-

This is conjecture, however, and doesn’t provide an ex-
planation for why the lower amplitude solutions should
have higher action. Naively, the smaller amplitude looks
like it should actually decrease the decay exponent be-
cause V (φ) stays larger in the exterior, which should de-
crease the decay exponent, according to Eq. (4). Indeed,
this does reduce B1 (Eq. (24) ) for the solutions we con-
sidered, but this was more than compensated for by an
increase in B2 (intuitively, the change in the geometry is
more signiﬁcant), which is actually signiﬁcant for the ‘ex-
tra’ solutions, unlike the case in the large amplitude so-
lutions, because the asymptotic geometry is closer to the
Hawking-Moss solution than it is to the false vacuum so-
lution. However, there remains no proof at this point that
the smaller-amplitude solutions do always have higher
action. The emergence of new solutions as H0 is raised
means that the appearance of extra solutions with lower
action, which would consequently dominate vacuum de-

cay, cannot be ruled out.
values, φ0, can produce overshoots or undershoots while
everything around it can produce undershoots, then there
is no obvious way of knowing that all CdL solutions have
been found.
Our approach was to search for discontinuities in the scan
plots like ﬁg. 5, and examine values of φ0 around them
until the narrow regions were found. Not all discontinu-
ities are so obvious, however, such as that in ﬁg. 7. For
there, it was necessary to ‘follow’ the solutions we found
along to their termination value, φ(χmax) and search at
higher resolution around that point to uncover the nar-
row regions where additional solutions lay. This process
was repeated until all overshoot-undershoot transitions
could be matched with a transition on the other side
of the barrier. However, this procedure does not guar-
antee that additional solutions, perhaps ‘disconnected’
from the ones already found, do not exist.
For comparison, we computed bounce solutions for the
Standard Model both with full back-reaction, and with
the ‘ﬁxed background’ approximation, that is, assuming
that the metric is unchanged from that of the de Sitter
background in the false vacuum. The use of a ﬁxed de
Sitter background did not change the conclusion that ex-
tra solutions appear, and their actions are only slightly
diﬀerent (see table II). The diﬀerence in decay exponents
between the ﬁxed de Sitter and full back-reaction cases
is essentially the same as is found in the ﬂat false vac-
uum (V0 = 0) case between the cases when back-reaction
is included and neglected[9], which is expected as the
decay exponents for the largest amplitude (‘CdL solu-
tion 1’) solutions do not deviate signiﬁcantly from the
V0 = 0 value. CdL solutions 3 and 4 display similar be-
havior. The most signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two
cases (ﬁxed vs non-ﬁxed background) is that the bounce
solutions in the ﬁxed case have a higher peak φ(0). This
behavior was also seen in the V0 = 0 case and is caused
by gravitational back-reaction altering the bounce scale
that dominates the decay rate[8–10].

As mentioned earlier, Joti et al.[20] recently published
a paper discussing vacuum instability in the Standard
Model during inﬂation, using a perturbative method.
They consider vacuum instability in the Standard Model,
in the regimes H0 (cid:28) H0crit, H0 ∼ H0crit and H0 (cid:29)
H0crit respectively. They argue that by Taylor expanding
around the top of the barrier for H0 ∼ H0crit, one can
ﬁnd bounces satisfying:

ﬁnd that the RHS of Eq. (42) is positive in the Stan-
dard Model, which implies that CdL bounces exist for
H0 > H0crit, with action larger than the Hawking-Moss
action. On this basis, they argue that for H0 > H0crit,
Hawking-Moss solutions should dominate vacuum decay,
with actions in the vicinity of B ∼ 13000 for H0 = H0crit.
Our results agree with the conclusion that CdL bounces
exist for H0 > H0crit. In fact, we would identify these
solutions with CdL solution 2 (see tables I and II), which
we found numerically. However, our numerical search
demonstrated the existence of multiple CdL bounces, in
particular, there is a large amplitude CdL bounce closely
matching the V0 = 0 case in its interior, but diﬀering in
the exterior (this is called CdL solution 1 in tables tables
I and II), which has a smaller action than the Hawking-
Moss solution at H0 = H0crit. This solution, with B ≈
1800, should dominate vacuum decay around H0 ∼ H0crit
and slightly above, not the Hawking-Moss solution and
the extra bounce solutions. This means that Hawking-
Moss solutions do not dominate until H0 = H0cross, when
SHM ∼ 1800. In the case we considered, this occurs at
H0cross = 1.9313 × 108GeV, higher than, but the same
order of magnitude as H0crit = 1.1931 × 108GeV.
In
practice, however, the eﬀect of this is simply to shift
the threshold at which Hawking-Moss domination be-
gins. For small H0 (cid:28) H0crit, and H0 > H0cross, our
results agree with the conclusions of [20].

IX. CONCLUSION

The most practical conclusion that can be drawn from
these results is that the largest amplitude CdL solution
has almost identical action to the V0 = 0 bounce, and
this action depends only very weakly on the Hubble
rate. Thus, below the cross-over threshold, it is a good
approximation to simply use the V0 = 0 bounce action.
This means that the question of the vacuum decay
rate becomes one of comparison between the largest

amplitude CdL (which we conjecture to have the lowest
action of the CdL solutions) and the Hawking-Moss
solution. There is no smooth transition between them -
whichever has the lowest action will dominate.
Importantly, however, we have found that the Standard
leads to a very rich set of

is likely that the form and nature of these solutions
depends strongly on the shape of the potential. Since the
eﬀective potential of the Standard Model couplings will
have curvature-corrections in de-Sitter space,
further
work is needed to establish the form of these solutions -
if they exist - in a potential with appropriate curvature
dependent energy scale. The eﬀect of non-minimal
coupling, as was considered in Ref.
[20] for example,
would be of particular interest. Despite this, our results
demonstrate vacuum instability in the Standard Model
is not straightforward when gravity is included. Not
only are the results quantitatively and qualitatively
diﬀerent to the ﬂat false vacuum case, but there are new
solutions which are not present in the V0 = 0 case.
Additionally, we showed that in the V0 → 0 limit, the
decay exponent will smoothly approach the V0 = 0
exponent, provided a family of bounce solutions exist
which approach the V0 = 0 bounce, and that χmax for
this family approaches zero in the manner of Eq. (36).
Although we have not proven that such a family always
exists, we have shown that its existence is plausible,
and we have numerically located a family of bounce
solutions for which χmax appears to satisfy Eq. (37) to a
high degree of accuracy. This suggests that the V0 → 0
limit is smooth in the Standard Model, which justiﬁes
neglecting the small cosmological constant observed
today in calculations of the vacuum decay rate.

Our results broadly agree with those of [20] regarding
the numerical value for the decay rate in the Standard
Model. However, we found additional CdL bounce
solutions that are not present in simpler polynomial
models, which change the behavior of the CdL solution
as a function of the background Hubble rate, H0,
particularly in the vicinity of the critical value, H0crit.
In particular, the largest amplitude CdL solution does
not merge with the Hawking-Moss solution at H0crit,
and instead persists at higher values of the Hubble rate.

These results also highlight that the critical threshold,
usually ﬁxed by the eigenvalues of the Hawking-Moss
solution,
is extremely important in some potentials,
and virtually irrelevant in others (such as the Standard
Model). The precise criteria that govern the existence
of CdL solutions, including ‘extra’ solutions not present
when V0 = 0, remain unclear. Jensen and Steinhardt
pointed out the importance of the H0 < H0crit condition
in reference [37]. However, this does not result in a
straightforward bound: H0 < H0crit guarantees a CdL
bounce exists, but H0 > H0crit does not rule it out[29].
It has been suggested that some sort of average over

18

the barrier should be the criteria instead[29, 33]. Since
bounces violating the H0 < H0crit bound are present in
the Standard Model, and not just model potentials, a
greater understanding of how and why CdL solutions
exist for a given potential is necessary.

Appendix A: Vanishing of B2

The B2 contribution to the action can be shown to van-
ish in the H0 limit, but the manner in which it vanishes
depends on the second derivative of the potential in the
false vacuum. Taking the limit as H0 → 0, B2 reduces
to:

B2 = − 6π2M 2

(A1)

This will be zero if the integral part is ﬁnite. To establish
this, we need to know the asymptotic behavior of δa0(χ).
As χ → ∞, the V0 = 0 solution approaches the false
vacuum, so the potential is well approximated by V (φ) =
1
2 m2(φ − φfv)2 + . . . (if m2 = V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φf v) > 0 - we will
consider the V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φfv) = 0 case separately). The scalar
ﬁeld equation becomes, approximately:

∆ ¨φ +

χ

∆ ˙φ − m2∆φ = 0,

(A2)

where ∆φ = φ − φfv (here we neglect quadratic terms
like δa0(χ)∆φ). This has a known solution in terms of
Bessel functions. In particular, to match the boundary
conditions, it must be of the form of the modiﬁed Bessel
function of the second kind, ∆φ ∝ K1(mχ)/χ. Asymp-
totically, this is exponential decay:

φ(χ) =

exp(−mχ).

(A3)

δa0(χ) then satisﬁes:

which means that it approaches a constant (0, because
of the boundary condition on δa0(χ)) exponentially fast.

19

This is suﬃcient to ensure that the integral is ﬁnite, so
B2 → 0.
The case of m2 = 0 is slightly more complicated, since
the equation is not linearizable in that case. However, it
will approximately satisfy:

∆φ0 (that is, ∆φ(χ)/∆φ0 diverges with positive coeﬃ-
cient) and (2) there are no turning points in the solution
(as these could imply a solution which oscillates before
diverging, which would provide a bound on φ0 for an os-
cillating bounce solution instead of the CdL bounce we
are interested in).
The relevant hypergeometric diﬀerential equation here
can be written as:

for large χ, which gives φ = C

Note that a 1

H0
cally as B2 ∼ limH0→0 H 2

vanishes in the H0 → 0 limit, but does so more slowly if
m2 = 0, approaching zero as ∼ H 2
0 log(H0) rather than
∼ H 2
0 .

Appendix B: False vacuum overshoots

In the paper it was claimed that solutions suﬃciently
close to the true vacuum are always overshoots. We
now prove this assertion. Consider linearizing about
the false vacuum. The scale factor is approximately
a = 1
sin(H0χ) since we remain inﬁnitesimally close
H0
to the false vacuum, and the scalar ﬁeld satisﬁes:

∆ ¨φ + 3H0 cot(H0χ)∆ ˙φ − V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φfv)∆φ = 0.

(B1)

We considered this equation earlier in the paper (see Eq.
(19) ). Transcribing the Hypergeometric function solu-
tion we ﬁnd:

To establish that this always overshoots, it is necessary
to show that (1) Eq. (B3) diverges with the same sign as

2

(cid:17)

where z = sin2 (cid:16) H0χ
. We aim to show that this solu-
tion diverges at z = 1 without encountering any turning
points. Note that the following argument only works if
V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φfv) > 0 - the V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φfv) = 0 case cannot be linearized.
Assuming V (cid:48)(cid:48)(φfv) > 0, we always have α2 < 9
4 . So, at a
turning point of the solution:

d2∆φ
dz2 =

4 − α2(cid:1)
(cid:0) 9
z(1 − z)

∆φ.

(B5)

Thus, for α2 < 9
4 , turning points always have the same
sign second derivative as the sign of ∆φ. In particular,
if ∆φ is positive, they will always be minima. Consider
∆φ0 > 0: ∆φ starts positive and initially increases (by
Eq. (22), since V (cid:48)(φfv + ∆φ0) > 0 for suﬃciently small
positive ∆φ0). This means it cannot ever encounter a
minimum other than the initial minimum at z = 0, since
that would require ﬁrst encountering a maximum for pos-
itive ∆φ, which is impossible by Eq. (B5). The same
applies in reverse for ∆φ0 < 0: there is an initial maxi-
mum and the solution can never encounter a minimum,
so cannot encounter a second maximum either. Con-
sequently, z = 0 is the only stationary point and the
solution monotonically increases/decreases according to
the sign of ∆φ0. It must also therefore diverge. In fact,
the only regular solutions to Eq. (B4) occur at speciﬁc
(eigen-)values of α2 such that the coeﬃcient of the diver-
gent part of Eq. (B6) is zero:

∆φ(z)
∆φ0

∼

cos(πα)
4 − α2(cid:1) π(1 − z)

,

(B6)

near z = 1. ∆φ/∆φ0 is positive near z = 1, since it
is positive and increasing near z = 0 and cannot have
a stationary point except at z = 0. This can also be
for α2 < 0, cos(απ) = cosh(|α|π) >
shown explicitly:
0; for 0 < α2 < 1
4 , cos(πα) > 0 and 1
4 − α2 > 0; for
1
4 < α2 < 9
4 − α2 < 0 too; for
α2 = 1
= 1. Hence the solution always
diverges on the same side as ∆φ0, and never has any
turning points. It is, therefore, an overshoot.
