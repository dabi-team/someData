ABSTRACT 

The mechanical integrity of composite materials depends primarily on the interface strength and the 

defect density of the reinforcement which is the provider of enhanced strength and stiffness. In the 

case of graphene/ polymer nanocomposites which are characterized by an extremely large interface 

region, any defects in the inclusion (such as folds, cracks, holes etc.) will have a detrimental effect 

to  the  internal  strain  distribution  and  the  resulting  mechanical  performance.  This  conventional 

wisdom, however, can be challenged if the defect size is reduced beyond the critical size for crack 

formation to the level of atomic vacancies. In that case, there should be no practical effect on crack 

propagation  and  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  vacancies  the  interface  strength  may  be  in  fact 

increase. 

In this work we employed argon ion (Ar+) bombardment and subsequent exposure to hydrogen (H2) 

to induce (as revealed by X-ray & Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) and  Raman 

spectroscopy)  passivated  atomic  single  vacancies  to  CVD  graphene.  The  modified  graphene  was 

subsequently transferred to PMMA bars and the morphology, wettability and the interface adhesion 

of the CVD graphene/PMMA system were investigated with Atomic Force Microscopy technique 

and Raman analysis. The results obtained showed clearly an overall improved mechanical behavior 

of  graphene/polymer  interface,  since  an  increase  as  well  a  more  uniform  shift  distribution  with 

strain  is  observed.  This  paves  the  way  for  interface  engineering  in  graphene/polymer  systems 

which, in pristine condition, suffer from premature graphene slippage and subsequent failure.

Introduction 

Graphene, an emerging nano-carbon material of atomic thickness[1] shows considerable promise in 

structural composite applications thanks to its unique combination of high tensile strength, Young’s 

2 

 
 
 
modulus [2] and structural flexibility [3, 4], which arise due to its structural (2D) perfection and its 

high strength and stiffness of the covalent C-C bonds [5].  Furthermore, thin sheets of graphene are 

amenable  to  new  textural  modifications  such  as  those  inspired  by  Japanese  Kirigami[6],  which 

could be stretched up to 240% of their initial length and bent using the radiation pressure of a laser 

beam or twisted with a magnetic field without breaking.   

The  excellent  mechanical  [7,  8],  electrical  [9,  10],  as  well  as,  thermal[11]  properties  of  graphene 

can  be  put  to  good  use  when  graphene  is  combined  with  other  materials  such  as  engineering 

plastics.  In most semi-industrial scale applications [12-14] graphene is incorporated in the form of 

exfoliated  flakes  of  μm  dimensions  but  the  obtained  results  are  often  limited  by  the  small  lateral 

size  and  ineffective  dispersion  [15,  16].  One  way  to  tackle  these  problems  particularly  in  certain 

applications, is to employ CVD-grown graphene [17, 18] that could be produced in either large or 

even  continuous  (roll-to-roll)  sheets  [12,  14]  that  can  be  incorporated  on  the  top  of  polymer 

substrates or even embedded into polymer matrices [19].  

However,  in  this  case  the  graphene  sheets  contain  structural  imperfections  such  as  a  network  of 

wrinkles,  cracks  and  folds  [20-25],  which  can  generally  be  defined  as  defects  [26-30]  and  impair 

somewhat the properties of the finished products. According to Han et al. [31], the onset of crack 

nucleation  occurs  near  the  presence  of  defects,  determine  graphene’s  performance  under  tensile 

loading.    Moreover,  the  low  interfacial  adhesion  between  graphene  and  polymer  due  to  the  weak 

van  der  Waals  bonding  is  still  a  problem  that  can  lead  to  premature  failure  of  CVD 

graphene/polymer  systems  at  small  strains  [32].  Nevertheless,  deviations  from  the  perfect  atomic 

arrangements in  graphene play an important  role in  affecting its performance  [19, 33-35], as they 

make  it  possible  to  tailor  its  local  properties  in  cases  where  it  is  applied  as  a  multi-functional 

coating [3, 36] in polymer matrices [37-40] for various composite applications [12, 14, 41-44] and 

to achieve new functionalities [45, 46].  

The most frequently employed polymer is the poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), which is used 

as a substrate for graphene transfer and as a matrix for device fabrication. Compared to other typical 

3 

polar molecules, such as polycarbonate or, even water, PMMA is a long-chain molecule with strong 

dipole  interaction  with  graphene  (attractive  inter-surface  forces  such  as  van  der  Waals  forces). 

Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have shown that PMMA radicals may form covalent 

bonds with a graphene defects, which usually appeared in grain boundaries.  In particular, the local 

re-hybridization of carbons causes sp2 to sp3 transitions; thus, modifying graphene’s band structure 

near the Fermi level [47].   

Several strategies are proposed to modify the graphene surface in order to strengthen the interfacial 

adhesion  [48-50].  Generally,  irradiation  by  electron  beam  [51],  or  by  ultra-violet  (UV)  radiation 

[52]  or  by  ion  radiation  at  room  temperature  gives  rise  to  a  continuous  formation  of  defects  and 

leading eventually to the development of holes and amorphization.   

Among  them,  argon  (Ar+)  ion  bombardment  is  the  most  studied  method  and  the  defects  are 

quantified mainly with Raman spectroscopy [53-55].  It has been found that when a population of 

defects is generated in a graphene sheet by irradiation and then is exposed to hydrogen, dissociative 

adsorption of hydrogen molecules is possible to occur [56]; thus, a better interfacial adhesion [45, 

46]  can  be  attained.    In  this  context,  it  has  been  suggested  that  this  dissociative  adsorption  of 

hydrogen  molecules  occurs  on  a  graphite  surface  at  vacancies  [57]  and  at  the  armchair  edge  of 

graphite [58]. 

Based on the above a method to improve the interfacial adhesion between CVD graphene/PMMA is 

proposed  herein.  The  main  idea  is  to  create  a  uniform  network  of  atomic  vacancies  beyond  the 

critical size for any crack or dislocation propagation. These vacancies can be treated (passivated) by 

chemical means in such a way that can act as anchors between graphene and surrounding polymer 

and thus enhance the interfacial adhesion.  As presented below, the defects are created in an Ultra 

High  Vacuum  chamber  (UHV)  by  Ar+  bombardment  on  a  CVD  graphene  grown  on  copper  (Cu) 

substrate and the defected samples are exposed to H2.   

Such a procedure leads to a high density of defects on graphene surface [54] which can be identified 

by a variety of analytical techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, 

4 

contact  angle  measurements  showed  that  this  procedure  also  leads  to  more  hydrophobic  surfaces, 

while  Raman  analysis  along  with  atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM)  topography  are  employed  for 

assessing the strain distribution in the graphene.   

1.  Experimental 

Synthesis  of  CVD  graphene  grown  on  Cu:  CVD  synthesis  of  graphene  was  performed  in  an 

AIXTRON®  (Black  Magic)  CVD  chamber.  Copper  foils  supplied  from  JX  Nippon  Mining  & 

Metals® with a purity of 99.95% were used as the catalyst substrates. Before the introduction of the 

copper foil into the CVD chamber, the foil was cut into 7 x 7 cm2 and cleaned by isopropanol to 

remove any organic contamination.  After the closure of the chamber, the foil was heated in 1000 

°C in argon/hydrogen atmosphere and was kept there for 5 min for annealing. Then, the hydrogen 

flow  was  terminated,  temperature  was  decreased  until  925  oC  and  at  the  same  time  methane  was 

introduced into chamber, as carbon feedstock to initiate the graphene growth on copper foil surface. 

After  5  min  at  925  oC,  the  chamber  was  cooled  down  to  650  oC,  where  the  methane  flow  was 

terminated.  Finally, the chamber was cooled gradually to room temperature. 

Ar+  ion  bombardment:  The  CVD  graphene/Cu  samples  were  introduced  in  UHV  chamber  and 

subjected  to  Ar+  bombardment  without  previous  treatment  in  order  to  avoid  changing  its  pristine 

properties. The only parameter which was varied was the ion energy, from 35 up to 200 eV, while 

the Ar+ pressure, the irradiation time and the spot were constant. The Ar+ pressure was 3x10−6 mbar, 

the duration 12 seconds, the distance between the sputtering gun and the sample was 6 cm while the 

spot size was a circle with 7 mm diameter. Subsequently after irradiation, the samples were exposed 

to hydrogen atmosphere (1bar) for 10 min in the high pressure chamber. 

Samples’  preparation  and  transfer  to  polymer  substrates:  The  modified  graphene  surfaces  were 

transferred  on  a  PMMA  substrate.  Both  pristine  and  treated  CVD  graphene/Cu  samples  were 

transferred from the copper foil to a PMMA substrate, by implementing a “dry transfer” method. 

The  steps  of  the  method  are  shown  schematically  in  Figure  S2.  With  this  method,  graphene  was 

5 

 
actually  transferred  to  the  desired  position,  on  the  PMMA  substrate,  just  before  the  removal  of 

copper.  Initially,  a  thin  layer  of  PMMA  ~200  nm  (495k,  3%  in  anisole)  was  spin-coated  on 

graphene and copper. After that, the graphene sample with the PMMA coated film and the PMMA 

substrate, were pressed for a couple of hours. Then, the uncoated graphene (back side of the copper 

foil)  was  removed  by  using  O2  plasma  and  the  copper  foil  was  etched  by  0.15M  ammonium 

persulfate (APS) solution. Finally, the sample was replenish with de-ionized water and dried under 

N2 flow. 

Characterization  by  implementing  XPS/UPS:  The  surface  analysis  studies  were  performed  in  a 

UHV chamber (P<10mbar), which consists of a three chambers: (a) a high pressure chamber, where 

exposures  of  samples  for  gas  pressure  up  to  several  atmospheres  takes  place,  (b)  a  preparation 

chamber, where the ion gun for Ar sputtering is placed and (c) an analysis chamber. The analysis 

chamber  is  equipped  with  a  SPECS  LHS-10  hemispherical  electron  analyzer,  a  dual-anode  x-ray 

source for XPS and a UV source (model UVS 10/35) for UPS measurements. 

The  XPS  measurements  were  carried  out  at  room  temperature  using  unmonochromatized  AlKa 

radiation under conditions optimized for maximum signal (constant  ΔΕ mode with pass energy of 

36 eV giving a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.9 eV for the Au 4f7/2 peak). The analyzed 

area was an ellipse with dimensions 2.5 x 4.5 mm2. The XPS core level spectra were analyzed using 

a  fitting  routine,  which can  decompose  each  spectrum  into  individual  mixed  Gaussian-Lorentzian 

peaks after a Shirley background subtraction. The UPS spectra were obtained using HeI irradiation 

with hν = 21.23 eV produced by a UV source (model UVS 10/35). During UPS measurements the 

analyzer  was  working  at  the  Constant  Retarding  Ratio  (CRR)  mode,  with  CRR  =  10.  The  work 

function was determined from the UPS spectra by subtracting their width (i.e. the energy difference 

between  the  analyzer  Fermi  level  and  the  high  binding  energy  cutoff),  from  the  HeI  excitation 

energy.  For  these  measurements  a  bias  of  −12.30  V  was  applied  to  the  sample  in  order  to  avoid 

interference of the spectrometer threshold in the UPS spectra. 

6 

Raman  measurements:  In  order  to  check  the  influence  of  the  morphology  of  the  substrate  on 

graphene properties, Raman mapping took place. Spectra were taken with at 514 nm (2.41 eV) laser 

using  a  MicroRaman  (InVia  Reflex,  Rensihaw,  UK)  set-up.  The  laser  power  was  kept  below  1.5 

mW on the sample to  avoid  laser-induced local  heating, while an Olympus  MPLN100x objective 

(NA = 0.90) was used to focus the beam on the samples. The obtained spectra of the pristine and 

treated CVD/PMMA system are presented in Figure S5. 

Contact  Angle  Measurements:  The  contact  angle  of  water  drops  on  the  surface  of  graphene/Cu 

samples were measured  as follows:  a droplet  of  the liquid  was deposited by a syringe which was 

positioned above the sample surface and the image captured by a high resolution stereomicroscope 

(Nikon SMZ1000) was analyzed to determine the contact angles. 

Mechanical tensile tests:  

Quasi-static  deformation:  The  top  surface  of  the  monolayer  CVD  graphene/PMMA  system  was 

subjected  to  tension  using  a  four-point  bending  apparatus.  A  more  detailed  description  of  the 

mechanical testing applied is presented elsewhere [59]. In order to conduct Raman mapping during 

loading, the four-point bending apparatus was placed on a three-axis piezoelectric translation stage 

that  was  operated  on  three  orthogonal  axes  by  a  ThorlabsInc.  piezoelectric  controller.  The 

NanoMax  three-axis  flexure  stage  can  provide  nano-metric  positioning  on  the  three  orthogonal 

axes.  At  each  strain  level,  the  stage  was  translated  with  a  step  of  5  μm  with  the  simultaneous 

collection  of  Raman  spectra  within  an  area  of  15  x  15  μm2  (16  total  points)  for  both  examined 

systems. 

Atomic Force Microscopy measurements: AFM images were collected by a contact mode (Bruker, 

Dimension-Icon). Images were obtained using ScanAsyst-Air probes (silicon tips on silicon nitride 

cantilever, Bruker) with 0.4 N m-1 nominal spring constant of the cantilever.

2.  Results and Discussion 

2.1 Modification of the CVD graphene sheets  

Since  the  monolayer  graphene  is  only  0.3  nm  thick  [60,  61],  surface  sensitive  methods,  such  as 

XPS, provide valuable information about the changes on graphene before and after irradiation.  The 

defects on a CVD mono-layer graphene on Cu are implemented by Ar+ ions irradiation in an UHV 

chamber.  In  order  to  avoid  possible  contamination  of  the  defect  sites  of  the  irradiated  surfaces 

during air exposure, the irradiated samples were subsequently exposed to H2 atmosphere.  

It has been shown that hot hydrogen atoms (H) (i.e. with a few tens of eV) can be adsorbed on the 

basal  plane  of  surface-clean  graphene,  while  adsorption  is  barrier-less  on  free  edges  or  vacancies 

(dangling  bonds)  [62].  In  the  present  study,  the  effect  of  H2  exposure  on  the  Ar+  irradiated  CVD 

graphene/Cu  is  investigated  and  it  was  found  that  H  adsorbed  on  the  defect  sites  created  by  Ar+ 

irradiation,  prevented  oxygen  contamination  from  air  [63].  The  details  are  presented  in  the 

Supporting Information.  

Subsequently, a method to induce defects with a controlled density is developed, by adjusting the 

energy  of  the  Ar+  that  interact  with  the  surface.  The  ion  energy  was  changed  by  regulating  the 

voltage of the anode in the ion gun, while the irradiation time remained constant (12s). The number 

of defects per cm2 of the graphene area was calculated by measuring the surface current during Ar+ 

irradiation  and  assuming  that  each  Ar+  ion  interacts  with  one  carbon  atom.  The  corresponding 

results for each ion energy are shown in Table 1 [64]. 

After  each  Ar+  energy  irradiation  and  H2  exposure  in-situ  XPS-UPS  and  ex-situ,  Raman 

measurements recorded. Figure 1 shows the deconvoluted C1s XP spectra for pristine (Figure 1a), 

Ar+  irradiated  and  H2-exposed  CVD  graphene/Cu  samples  for  different  Ar+  energies.  In  order  to 

remove  the  background  noise  caused  by  inelastic  electron  scattering,  a  simple  Shirley-type 

correction was introduced. 

The C1s peaks are analyzed into four components at binding energies 284.70 ± 0.05 eV assigned to 

the C=C sp2 bonds, at 285.60 ± 0. 05 eV attributed to carbon atoms with sp3 hybridization and two 

8 

components  and  at  286.70  ±  0.1  eV  and  288.5  ±0  .1  eV  assigned  to  C-OH  and  O-C=O  bonds, 

respectively [65]. The Ar+ impact per cm2 area has been directly correlated to the sp3/sp2 ratio and 

the results are shown in  Table 1. The  sp3/sp2 intensity components ratio for the pristine sample is 

0.10 corresponding to ~9% sp3, which comes into agreement with the results obtained by Luo et al. 

[66] 

Figure  2  shows  the  HeI  UPS  valence  band  spectra  and  the  high  binding  energy  cutoff,  from  the 

pristine and the treated CVD graphene/Cu surfaces, respectively.  In Figure 2I, the region 0-12 eV 

consists mainly of 3 peaks:(i) at ~3 eV (labeled as A) attributed to pπ electrons (sp2 hybridization), 

(ii) at ~6 eV (labeled as B) assigned to 2pπ+σ and (iii) at~ 10 eV (labeled as C) assigned to 2s-2p 

hybridization[67]. No great differences seems to be present in the spectra for Ar+ energies of range 

35-130 eV, whereas at 200 eV the peak at ~6 eV is decreased in comparison to the peak at ~10 eV, 

while  a  reduction  of  the  density  of  2pπ  states  (~3  eV)  near  the  Fermi  level  is  observed.    These 

changes  in  the  valence  band  are  expected  since  the  sp3  C-H  defects  in  graphene,  depresses  the 

delocalized π-electrons significantly.   

Figure 2II shows the cut-off of the high binding energy region, where the work function (WF) of 

graphene can be estimated by subtracting the width of the photoelectron spectrum from the photon 

energy. The WF of the pristine surface is 4.40 ± 0.05 eV in agreement with literature values for a 

pristine graphene [67]. For the irradiated surfaces, the WF is gradually decreased starting from 65 

eV  Ar+  energy  irradiation  and  reaching  the  value  of  4.20  ±  0.05  eV  for  200  eV  Ar+  energy 

(Δφ=0.2eV).  

It is known that the sp3bonding of carbon surface terminated in hydrogen leads to a small decrease 

of  the  work  function  which  arises  from  the  formation  of  a  C-δ–H+δ  surface  dipole  layer  and  its 

magnitude is proportional to the surface coverage of hydrogen [68]. Thus, the slight decrease of the 

WF of the treated surfaces is an indication of low coverage by H of the defected sites.  

The Raman spectra of the pristine graphene/Cu and the treated surfaces are showed in Figure S2 in 

the  supplementary.  The  Raman  spectrum  of  graphene  has  the  typical  peaks  of  all  carbon 

9 

allotropes[69]. Briefly, the G and D peaks, around 1580 and 1360 cm−1 are due to  the sp2bonded 

carbons. The G peak corresponds to the E2g phonon at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center (Γ point). The 

D peak is  due to  the breathing modes of six-atom rings and requires a defect  for its activation. It 

comes  from  TO  phonons  around  the  BZ  K  point,  and  it  is  activated  by  an  intra  valley  scattering 

process. The 2D peak is the second order of the D peak. The defect activated D΄ peak comes from 

the LO branch of the phonon dispersion and is seen around 1620 cm−1. 

The evolution of Raman spectrum follows the trend firstly reported by Cançado et al.[54]; thus, the 

increase of bombardment dose is followed by the appearance and enhancement of the D peak (35-

65 eV) and the subsequent increase of the ratio I(D)/I(G). As the applied ion-dose further increases, 

the D΄peak rises and all Raman peaks broaden (~120 eV).  Due to broadening, the G and D΄ peaks 

tend to overlap and form a single wider and blue shifted peak, while a sharp decrease of the ratio 

I(D)/I(G)  is  observed  (130-200  eV).  Therefore,  the  decrease  of  the  ratio  I(D)/I(G)  indicates  here 

enhancement of disorder since the G peak incorporates in essence the disordered-induces D΄ peak. 

The  cut-off  dose  for  defect  creation  is  ~35  eV,  whereas  above  ~200  eV  graphene  is  severely 

damaged.  

Based  on  the  obtained  Raman  spectra  (Figure  S2a,b)  and  the  dependence  of  the  ratio  I(D)/I(G) 

versus  the  bombardment  dose  applied  (Figure  S2c),  the  energy  of  120  eV  is  selected  (optimum 

energy applied), as a trade-off between the number of defected areas and their size [54], in order to 

further investigate the stress transfer efficiency of defected graphene/PMMA system.  

2.2 Evaluating the morphology and the interface integrity of the CVD graphene coating/PMMA 

system before and after the insertion of defects 

The morphology  and the interface integrity  of the  pristine  and the  treated CVD  graphene/PMMA 

system was evaluated for several samples. Initially, AFM was employed for both systems, to assess 

the structure of the as supported CVD graphene at the nanoscale.  As can be seen from AFM high 

resolution  images  (Figure  3),  two  different  morphologies  appeared  depending  on  whether  or  not 

10 

 
they had been treated by Ar+ irradiation. The first region (Figure 3a, c) is relatively “flat” while the 

second  that  has  a  “rugged”  appearance  corresponds  to  the  presence  of  folds  without  a  preferred 

orientation (Figure 3b, d).   

These areas seem to be created on Cu foil, at the cooling step of CVD process [70, 71] and then are 

transferred  directly  on  PMMA  bar  during  the  transfer  process  (Figure  S3)  (see  also  experimental 

section).  The creation of folds presented in Figures 3b and 3d are very similar to the folds appeared 

on graphene oxide films due to applied biaxial compression [72]. The latter seems to be confirmed 

also for the samples examined by Raman measurements (Table S1), as it will be discussed further in 

the text. Similar images obtained from other specimens are also presented in Figure S5.  

In  addition  to  the  topographical  study,  adhesion  force  measurements  were  also  recorded.  The 

obtained  statistical  analysis  (histograms)  of  the  adhesion  forces  show  an  unsymmetrical  Gaussian 

distribution for the pristine (both for the “flat” and “rugged” areas) and more symmetrical for the 

treated  graphene,  respectively  (Figure  3a(ii)  and  3c(ii)).  Similarly,  the  maximum  value  of  the 

Gaussian distributions is shifted from 3.22 nN at the pristine state to higher force values of 5.18 nN 

for  the  treated  surface,  respectively.    Analogous  behavior  was  observed  for  the  “rugged”  regions 

(Fig. 3b(ii) & 3d(ii)), where the mean value of the adhesion force is increased from 2.85 nN for the 

pristine to 5.84 nN for the treated specimens, respectively. 

Based  on  the  analysis  made  by  Jiang  et  al.  [73]  (see  also  Supporting  Information),  the  adhesion 

energy  between  graphene  and  PMMA  substrate  can  be  measured  by  force  spectroscopy  mode  of 

AFM, using the Maugis-Dugdale model [74].  As depicted in Table 2, there is a great increase of 

the surface energy, reaching up to 115% and 66% for the “rugged” and “flat” regions, respectively.  

As  it  is  stated  Jiang  et  al.  [73],  the  surface  roughness  significantly  affects  the  measured  adhesion 

force  (Table  2).  By  introducing  a  controllable  amount  of  defects,  the  graphene’s  roughness;  thus, 

affecting further its interaction with the PMMA substrate.  

Such an increase of the adhesion force can only  be attributed to the modification of the graphene 

surface  by  the  insertion  of  defects  followed  by  the  H2  exposure.    It  seems  that  such  a 

11 

functionalization  improves  the  bonding  between  graphene  and  hydrophobic  PMMA  transfer  film 

(see also Experimental and Figure S3), as it is also confirmed by the macroscopic results obtained 

from the contact angle measurements (Figure S4), where an increase of 10% is recorded (Table 3). 

The  effect  of  the  presence  of  defects  in  the  wettability  of  graphene  has  been  studied  for  oxygen 

plasma  treated  graphene  on  SiC  [75].    As  the  density  of  defects  induced  by  plasma  treatment 

increases,  the  surface  energy  also  increases  due  to  the  fact  that  the  graphene  become  polar  after 

creating  polar  O−H  bonds  leading  to  a  hydrophilic  nature.  In  our  case,  the  passivation  of  treated 

graphene with hydrogen atoms results just the opposite.  As it is stated by Wu et al. [63], during the 

preparation  of  graphene  sheets  by  thermal  exfoliation  of  graphene  oxide  (GO),  the  presence  of 

hydrogen is essential for de-oxygenation of GO as well for structural defects removal; thus, oxygen-

containing groups, i.e. hydrophilic surface functionalities, lead to a formed graphene with superior 

properties. 

By  following  Neumann’s  model  [76]  (see  also  Supporting  Information)  and  by  applying  a  water 

droplet  (polar solvent) before  and after the treatment, the obtained surface energy of graphene on 

Cu is reduced by 5.9% (Table 3); thus, becoming less hydrophilic. Therefore, the changes observed 

on  the  wetting  behavior  of  graphene  seem  to  affect  positively  its  interaction  with  the  non-polar 

PMMA  film  during  the  transferring  process;  thus,  better  interactions  with  the  PMMA  substrate 

(bar),  leading  to  different  mechanical  response  to  the  external  applied  load,  as  it  will  be  further 

discussed below. 

Additionally, by analyzing the profiles of the most representative Raman peaks of graphene (2D, G 

and  D)  [77-79]  for  both  graphene  systems,  it  seems  to  lead  to  the  same  result.    By  carefully 

selecting the same sampling areas of 20 x 20 μm2 presented in Figure 4, a full Raman investigation 

(121 data points) from both systems are obtained (Figure S6a and b). The statistical analysis of the 

above is presented in Figure S7.   

For both systems, Pos(2D) has a mean value of the order of ~ 2690 cm-1, indicating the presence of 

compression and/or doping[59] (Figure S7a, b). If we reasonably consider that the Pos(2D) shift is

due  to  the  imposition  of  biaxial  strain  during  the  production  process[80],  the  corresponding 

compressive biaxial strain calculated, using the sensitivity value +148 cm-1%[80], varies between -

0.07% and -0.06% for the pristine and treated system, respectively (Table S3).   

By correlating Pos(2D) versus Pos(G) as shown in Figure S8, it can be argued that for the collected 

data points the mechanical loading dominates upon doping77, since the majority of the points follow 

a linear relationship.  Especially,  for the  case of  the  treated  CVD graphene the least-squares  fitted 

slope  (~1.7)  is  greater  than  the  corresponding  for  the  pristine  system  (~1.4),  implying  a  greater 

mechanical adhesion [59, 81].  

As  for  the  Raman  linewidths,  useful  interpretations  can  be  extracted  regarding  doping,  strain, 

disorder and number of layers in graphene[82, 83]. For the pristine CVD synthesized graphene film, 

the corresponding value of FWHM(2D) (33.34.2 cm-1) (Figure S7b) at rest is larger compared to 

exfoliated flakes (24 cm-1)  [84] and the reasons for that are given  elsewhere  [84, 85]. However, 

there is a set of data points exhibiting values of FWHM(2D) greater than 33 cm-1, corresponding to 

~20% of the examined data points (Figure S7b), which is attributed to bi-layer or even multilayer 

islands  (three  layers  or  more)  [86,  87],  as  it  has  been  explained  elsewhere  [77,  86-90].  For  the 

treated CVD synthesized graphene sheet, the increased value of FWHM(2D) (Figure S7d) occurs as 

a result of the defect insertion, as it is also confirmed in Figure S2a.  Similar results are observed for 

the FWHM of the G peak (Figure S7g and h) 

In addition, the presence of defect-activated D band[54, 91] is relatively lower for the pristine case, 

as it is confirmed by the value of ~0.50 for the I(D)/I(G) ratio (Figure S7i).  The latter indicates that 

the pristine examined system has indeed a small amount of disorder or defects [92, 93].  According 

to Cançado et al.[54, 94], by the insertion of defects, (Figure S2 and S6b) the intensity ratio of the D 

and G Raman peaks (I(D)/I(G)) increases (Figure S7i and j), the D΄ peak appears (Figure S6b), and 

a broadening of all peaks is also observed (Figure S2 and S6b)[91]. By implementing a controllable 

defect insertion, the obtained corresponding value is of the order of ~3 (Figure S7j).  

13 

Following  the  analysis  of  Eckmann  et  al.  [55],  for  the  relative  intensity  of  the  D  and  D΄  peaks 

(Figure S9), it is suggested that the inserted defects, for the optimum energy 120eV (Figure S2c),  

are  actually  single-vacancy  defects,  since  the  value  of  I(D)/I(D΄)  is  of  the  order  of  ~8.5.    Similar 

results  were  also  obtained  by  Polin  et  al.[95],  who  argued  that  graphene  becomes  stiffer  by 

controlled  defect  creation.    As  it  will  be  shown  below,  it  seems  that  those  vacancies  are  actually 

assisting graphene to interact better with the polymer substrate (PMMA bar), as it is proved by the 

increase of the adhesion force (Figure 3). 

2.3 Implementation of mechanical loading 

The  mechanical  response  for  both  pristine  and  treated  CVD  graphene  /PMMA  systems  upon 

external  deformation  (up  to  1.0%)  for  an  area  in  the  specimens  of  15  x15  μm2  was  investigated. 

Prior  to  loading  the  strain  state  of  the  examined  specimens  was  identified  within  the  allocated 

sampling areas and the residual compressive strain is presented in Table S3. 

An important parameter that has been identified by us and others previously [37, 96-98] as an index 

of stress-transfer efficiency, is the Raman shift rate per strain for the two most common mentioned 

vibrational  modes  (2D  and  G).    For  exfoliated  graphene/  PMMA  systems  the  maximum  values 

recorded are in the range of 55-60 cm-1/% for the 2D peak and ~25cm-1/% for the mean value of the 

G peak [99]. For corresponding CVD graphene/ PMMA systems the above values represent upper 

limits often difficult to attain due to the inherent morphological defects of the CVD-grown graphene 

[19, 34, 100].  In this context, strain rate maps extracted for both loading and unloading cycles can 

actually  be  considered  as  an  indirect  adhesion  indicators,  since  the  measured  Raman  variations 

shifts  of  Pos(2D)  and  Pos(G)  are  related  with  the  “true”  strain  transferred  from  the  matrix  to  the 

inclusion.   

During loading, a broad value range for the strain rate of Pos(2D) is observed for the pristine CVD 

graphene /PMMA system (Figure 4a).  Particularly, there is a group of points (Group A, Figure 5a), 

for  which  the  Pos(2D)  is  shifted  to  lower  values  at  very  low  rates  (from  -5  to  -15  cm-1/%).  

14 

 
However, there are other points (Group B), for which the strain rates reach -55 cm-1/% [101], which 

is the upper limit as mentioned above and also confirmed by others [37, 97-99].  

Similarly, the Pos(G) red-shifts at a rate of -6 to -3 cm-1/% for Group A, while the points of Group 

B exhibit shits of up to -17 cm-1/% (Figure S10a).  Moreover, for Group B, splitting of both the G 

and  2D  peaks  are  observed  which  are  indicative  of  efficient  loading  of  the  inclusion  [102,  103].  

The latter is depicted in Figure S11, where typical spectra from both point groups are presented for 

applied strain of 0.80%. During unloading, both groups of points are shifting back at similar shift 

rates as the loading curves indicating elastic behavior (Figure 4b, Figure S10b). 

On the contrary the treated CVD graphene/PMMA system exhibits on average a much higher and 

narrower distribution of Pos(2D) shift rates during loading (Figure 6a), of ~-30 cm-1/%. Therefore, 

it  can  be  stated  that  the  overall  interaction  with  the  substrate  is  higher  than  to  the  cases  prior  to 

treatment and therefore the stress transfer efficiency has been greatly improved. Similar results are 

obtained for the Pos(G) which shifts approximately by ~-10 cm-1/% on average (Figure S12a), very 

close  to  the  value  of  -14.7  cm-1/%  obtained  elsewhere  [37]  for  CVD  graphene.  During  unloading 

(Figure 5b, S12b), all the points of the examined area are blue-shifting with almost the same strain 

rate for both bands.   

Figure  6  shows  the  section  analysis  of  AFM  images  prior  and  after  loading  for  the  pristine  and 

treated CVD graphene, respectively. After loading, it seems that the treated graphene has returned 

to  a  great  extent  to  its  initial  loading  position,  compared  to  the  pristine  specimen  (Figure  S13). 

Furthermore,  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  relative  change  of  surface’s  height  (ΔΗ/Ηo)  prior  and 

after loading, shows an unsymmetrical Gaussian distribution for the pristine and more symmetrical 

for the treated graphene, respectively (Figure 6a(iii) and 6b(iii)).   

For  the  former,  recent  works  suggests  that  the  repetitive  reforming  and  breaking  of  interaction  at 

interface  region  would  occur  during  sliding  process  for  both  van  der  Waals  and  H-bonds 

interactions [104, 105]. In case of the treated system, the insertion of specific population of defects 

on the CVD graphene along with their covering by H atoms, affects its interaction with the PMMA 

15 

surface to a greater and more homogeneous extent; thus, graphene interacts better with the polymer 

substrate caused by a strong interaction of the defects with the PMMA. 

3.  Conclusions 

In this work, CVD graphene on Cu substrate is treated by inserting defects with a well-controlled 

population  by  Ar+  bombardment  in  an  UHV  chamber,  followed  by  a  subsequent  exposure  to 

hydrogen atmosphere. The treated surfaces were characterized by several techniques which revealed 

that hydrogen reacts with carbon at the defect sites and passivated the carbon atoms.  

We  have  shown  that  a  controlled  generation  of  atomic  defects  to  CVD  graphene  results  in  the 

moderate increase of the adhesion between graphene  and a polymer substrate and leads to a more 

uniform  strain  uptake  in  reinforcing  inclusion.  Since  graphene  adheres  to  polymer  substrates 

through weak van der Waals bonding, this approach paves the way for improving the mechanical 

behavior  of  graphene/  polymer  interface  and  for  eventually  tailoring  the mechanical  properties  of 

graphene.  While  the  proposed  method  presented  herein  represent  the  interface  of  CVD 

graphene/PMMA,  it  can  be  applied  to  other  2D  materials  improving  the  interfacial  mechanics  of 

composite materials.
