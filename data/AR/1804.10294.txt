We report on the ﬁrst cross section measurement of charged-current single charged pion production
by neutrinos and antineutrinos on argon. This analysis was performed using the ArgoNeuT detector
exposed to the NuMI beam at Fermilab. The measurements are presented as functions of muon
momentum, muon angle, pion angle, and angle between muon and pion. The ﬂux-averaged cross
sections are measured to be 2.7±0.5(stat)±0.5(syst)×10−37cm2/Ar for neutrinos at a mean energy
of 9.6 GeV and 8.4 ± 0.9(stat)+1.0
−0.8(syst) × 10−38cm2/Ar for antineutrinos at a mean energy of 3.6
GeV with the charged pion momentum above 100 MeV/c. The results are compared with several
model predictions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Precision neutrino cross section measurements are cru-
cial in order to fully characterize the properties of the
neutrino-nucleus interaction.
In present and future
neutrino oscillation experiments, such as T2K, NOvA,
SBN, DUNE, and HyperKamiokande [1–5], the neutrino-
nucleus interaction must be well understood in order to
reconstruct the incoming neutrino from properties of the
ﬁnal state.

Charged-current single pion production (CC1π±) is
an important process in few-GeV neutrino-nucleus in-
teractions [6]. The process is mainly produced through
nucleon resonances and deep inelastic scattering. The
earliest neutrino CC1π± measurements used hydrogen
or deuterium targets. There are some discrepancies
among this early data, most notably, the ANL [7] and
BNL [8] measurements diﬀer by up to 40% in normal-
ization. A recent reanalysis of the two experiments
prefers the ANL measurement [9]. The nuclear medium
plays an important role in the production and propa-
gation of hadrons produced in neutrino-nucleus interac-
tions. Hadrons produced in neutrino-nucleus interactions

∗ tjyang@fnal.gov

may re-scatter while propagating through the nuclear
medium, referred to as ﬁnal-state interactions (FSI), and
can change the charge and multiplicity of the outgoing
hadrons, as well as altering their kinematics [10, 11].
There are more modern measurements of νµ CC1π+ on
various nuclear targets which show varying degrees of
agreements with diﬀerent model predictions. The Mini-
BooNE [12], MINERνA [13] and T2K [14] Collaborations
provided measurements of this cross section in mineral
oil, plastic scintillator and water, respectively.

We present the ﬁrst CC1π± diﬀerential cross section
measurement on argon using the ArgoNeuT (Argon Neu-
trino Test) detector [15]. The signal is deﬁned to be a
charged-current νµ or ¯νµ interaction in the detector, with
one charged pion above 100 MeV/c momentum exiting
the target nucleus. Events with neutral or charged kaons
or neutral pions or more than one charged pions above
100 MeV/c momentum in the ﬁnal state are excluded.
The strategy adopted in this analysis relies on classifying
events, after a chain of topology cuts, with the help of
the ROOT Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis [16], with
which a boosted decision tree (BDT) is created using re-
constructed quantities in the TPC ﬁducial volume.

The results presented here will serve to help better con-
strain the modeling of neutrino-nucleus interactions. In
practice, the ArgoNeuT CC1π± cross section measure-

 
 
 
 
 
 
ment will provide useful information on the single pion
production to the Monte Carlo (MC) generators, improv-
ing the constraints on both resonant pion production and
FSI models. These data will be of particular beneﬁt to
the planned DUNE experiment [17], which will use argon
as the target in its far detector.

II. ARGONEUT EXPERIMENT

ArgoNeuT is a 170 L liquid argon time projection
chamber (LArTPC) with dimensions 47 × 40 × 90 cm3
(horizontal drift dimension × height × length). The elec-
tric ﬁeld inside the TPC is 481 V/cm, and the drifted
charge from particle interactions is read out in two planes
of 240 wires each (the induction and collection planes)
with a plane spacing and a wire pitch of 4 mm. The an-
gle between the induction and collection plane wires is
60 degrees.

ArgoNeuT collected neutrino and antineutrino events
in Fermilab’s NuMI beam line [18] at the MINOS near de-
tector hall from September, 2009 through February, 2010.
In combination with ArgoNeuT, the downstream MI-
NOS near detector is used to fully reconstruct neutrino-
induced events. The measurements reported in this pa-
per are based on data taken with the NuMI beam line
operating in the reverse horn current (antineutrino en-
hanced) mode, corresponding to 1.25 × 1020 protons on
target (POT) during which both ArgoNeuT and MINOS
near detector were operational. 60% of all interactions
in ArgoNeuT derive from neutrinos, while the remain-
ing 40% are produced by antineutrinos [19]. The ﬂux-
averaged neutrino energy is 9.6 GeV for neutrinos and
3.6 GeV for antineutrinos.

The MINOS near detector is a 1 kton magnetized
steel/scintillator tracking/sampling calorimeter [20] and
it operated approximately 1.5 m downstream of Ar-
goNeuT. The muons that exit ArgoNeuT’s TPC vol-
ume are matched to MINOS, where the momentum and
charge are reconstructed. ArgoNeuT is not magnetized
so there is no possibility to separate pions according to
their charge.

Figure 1 shows the resonant pion production and non-
resonant pion production components in simulated Ar-
goNeuT CC1π± events using the GENIE [21] neutrino
event generator. Nonresonant pion production involves
quasielastic scattering, deep inelastic scattering (nonreso-
nant multi-hadron production), coherent pion production
and meson exchange current events. According to the
GENIE generator, resonant pion production contributes
39% and 61% to the νµ and ¯νµ CC1π± cross sections,
respectively. The remaining CC1π± events are produced
predominantly through deep inelastic scattering. 89% of
the νµ CC1π± events contain a π+ while 97% of the ¯νµ
CC1π± events contain a π−. Coherent pion production
contributes 3% and 5% to the νµ and ¯νµ CC1π± cross
sections, respectively [22].

III. EVENT RECONSTRUCTION AND
SELECTION

The drifting of ionization electrons in liquid argon and
the signal digitization in the ArgoNeuT detector are sim-
ulated in LArSoft [23]. The neutrino and antineutrino in-
teractions inside ArgoNeuT are reconstructed using the
LArSoft software package, rendering a full characteriza-
tion of the charged particles emerging in the ArgoNeuT
detector. The reconstruction software provides the spa-
tial information of each reconstructed track as well as the
particle identiﬁcation based on the calorimetric informa-
tion. The details of the reconstruction chain used by this
analysis are described in Appendix A.

After tracking ﬁnal state muons in ArgoNeuT, an at-
tempt is made to match the 3D tracks that leave Ar-
goNeuT with muons that have been reconstructed in MI-
NOS and have a hit within 20 cm of the upstream face of
the MINOS detector. This matching criterion is based on
the radial and angular diﬀerences between the projected-
to-MINOS ArgoNeuT track and the candidate MINOS
track, taking into account the expected muon multiple
scattering.
In the ArgoNeuT detector, the muon en-
ergy loss before reaching MINOS is calculated from the

A stand-
alone version of MINOS simulation and reconstruction is
used to characterize the tracks passing from ArgoNeuT
into MINOS. If the muon is reconstructed in the MINOS
near detector, the muon momentum is measured from its
range or the track curvature, depending on whether the
muon stops in MINOS or not.

Fig. 2 shows a µ−π± candidate event in ArgoNeuT.
The LArSoft reconstruction package successfully recon-
structs both charged particles as 3D tracks, with both
tracks exiting the LArTPC and the most forward going
track matched to a track in the MINOS detector.

FIG. 2. A µ−π± candidate event in ArgoNeuT. The top ﬁgure
shows the 2D projection in the two wire planes while the
bottom ﬁgure shows the 3D reconstructed tracks.

In this analysis, we ﬁrst apply the νµ/¯νµ CC event
selection that is similar to what we developed in the pre-
vious ArgoNeuT CC-inclusive analyses [24, 25]. We re-
quire that there is at least one track in ArgoNeuT that is
matched to a track in the MINOS detector. The matched
track in ArgoNeuT is identiﬁed as the “muon track”. All
the reconstructed vertices within 4 cm of the start point
of the muon track are considered and the closest ver-
tex to the start point of the muon track is identiﬁed as
the neutrino interaction vertex. The reconstructed neu-

3

trino interaction vertex is required to be inside of the
ArgoNeuT ﬁducial volume, deﬁned as a rectangular box
shaped as follows: the boundary from the plane compris-
ing the induction plane and that of the cathode plane
is 3 cm, the boundary from the top and bottom of the
TPC is 4 cm, and the distances from the upstream and
downstream ends are 6 cm and 4 cm, respectively.

Neutrino-induced through-going muons that pass the
ﬁducial volume requirement due to possible ineﬃciency in
the vertex reconstruction are removed by two additional
requirements. First, we reconstruct all the possible 3D
points using all hit pairs on the two wire planes that have
the same drift time. We reject events that have any 3D
points within 4 cm to the LArTPC front surface. Sec-
ondly, we consider all the uncontained tracks that start
within 4 cm of the reconstructed neutrino interaction ver-
tex and calculate the angle between each track and the
muon track. One major background arises from the pres-
ence of broken tracks for which, due to a reconstruction
failure, a single through-going muon is reconstructed as
two tracks going back-to-back. We reject events where
the largest angle between the muon track and any other
track is above 170 degrees, which indicates a through-
going muon is broken into two tracks.

Our goal is to detect events with one muon track, one
charged pion track, and any number of protons. After
the removal of through-going muons, we investigate all
tracks that are at least 4 cm long and start within 4 cm
of the reconstructed neutrino interaction vertex, exclud-
ing the muon track matched to MINOS. The track length
requirement imposes an approximate 100 MeV/c thresh-
old on the pion momentum.
If only one track is iden-
tiﬁed as charged pion or muon (stopping charged pions
and muons are almost indistinguishable in a LArTPC)
by the calorimetry based particle identiﬁcation, detailed
in Appendix A, the event is selected. Because of the
small size of ArgoNeuT, many protons are not contained
in the detector and they are often ﬂagged as charged pion
or muon using only the measured dE/dx information in-
side the TPC. As a consequence, approximately 16% of
the true CC1π± signal events have two tracks that are
identiﬁed as charged pion or muon in addition to the
muon track. We relax the selection to also accept events
with one muon track matched to MINOS and two tracks
identiﬁed as charged pion or muon to improve the signal
selection eﬃciency. We take track identiﬁed as charged
pion or muon with the lower average dE/dx (energy loss
per unit length) as the charged pion candidate.

To further improve the signal to background ratio, we
created boosted decision trees (BDT) using the ROOT
Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis. The BDT is trained
using simulated signal and background samples. The
simulation of neutrino interactions in ArgoNeuT employs
a geant4-based [26] detector model and particle propa-
gation software in combination with the GENIE neutrino
event generator. The neutrino and antineutrino ﬂuxes for
the NuMI beam were taken from reference [27], by the
MINERνA Collaboration. To minimize the dependence

the calorimetry and event topology information when we
build the BDT. The input variables are:

• Average dE/dx calculated using the last 5 cm of

the candidate pion track;

• Number of tracks identiﬁed as charged pion or

muon;

• Number of reconstructed vertices;

• Fraction of total measured charge that is associated

with all reconstructed tracks;

• Fraction of total measured charge that is associated
with reconstructed tracks originating from the re-
constructed neutrino interaction vertex.

The last three variables are chosen to remove the deep
inelastic scattering background where the complex topol-
ogy tends to lead to many reconstructed vertices and
tracks or failure in reconstructing some tracks. Two
BDTs are trained for neutrino and antineutrino samples
separately. Table I shows the number of data events after
each selection requirement. More detailed information
can be found in [28].

IV. BACKGROUND ESTIMATION,
UNFOLDING AND CROSS SECTION RESULTS

To estimate the rate of background events in the sig-
nal region (BDT score > 0), the BDT distributions in
data for µ− and µ+ events are ﬁt to a linear combination
of templates for CC1π± signal and background, obtained
from a simulated neutrino and antineutrino sample using
the GENIE neutrino event generator, which is the same
method used in Ref. [22]. Here only the shape informa-
tion of the simulated BDT distributions is used, which
helps to reduce the systematic uncertainties. Fig. 3 shows
the ﬁts of the BDT distributions. Table II summarizes
the results of the ﬁts. We consider data events with BDT
> 0 as CC1π± signal candidates and the ﬁtted number of
background events in the region BDT > 0 is subtracted
from data.

where N is the number of data events in a given X bin
after applying the full selection, Nb is the number of back-
ground event in the same bin, ∆X is the bin size, NAr is
the number of Ar nuclei inside the ﬁducial volume and Φ
is the integrated ﬂux during the data taking period. The
bin-by-bin unfolding factor (cid:15)UF combines corrections for
acceptance, eﬃciencies of the event selection, and resolu-
tion eﬀects using the CC1π± neutrino and antineutrino
events simulated with GENIE. The numerator of the un-
folding factor is obtained by applying the same require-
ments to the GENIE-simulated CC1π± events as the ones
applied to data. The denominator of the unfolding fac-
tor is obtained by requiring the true neutrino interaction
of the CC1π± event is inside the ﬁducial volume.
In
this paper, we report the diﬀerential cross sections as a
function of four kinematic variables: the outgoing muon
momentum (pµ), the outgoing muon angle with respect
to the initial neutrino direction (θµ), the outgoing pion
angle with respect to the initial neutrino direction (θπ)
and the angle between the outgoing muon and pion (θµπ).
Figures 4 and 5 show the unfolding factors for νµ and
¯νµ CC1π± events, respectively. The bin sizes are choose
to have reasonable statistics in each bin. The bin sizes are
much bigger than the detector resolutions so the bin mi-
gration eﬀect is negligible. The systematic uncertainties
are evaluated by varying the GENIE simulation parame-
ters, which will be discussed more later. The acceptance
of muons goes from 80% for forward going muons to 36%
for muon angle at 40 degrees.

The measured diﬀerential cross sections for νµ(¯νµ)
CC1π± productions are shown in Fig. 6(7) and listed in
Table III(IV). The ﬂux-averaged cross sections are listed
in Table V. Both the diﬀerential and ﬂux-averaged cross
sections are compared with four MC generators: GE-
NIE, GiBUU [29], NEUT [30, 31], and NuWro [11]. Pre-
dictions from the diﬀerent MC generators are shown in
Fig. 6 and 7.

The systematic uncertainties aﬀecting the background
estimation, unfolding and ﬁnal cross section measure-
ments are listed in Table VI. These are dominated by
the neutrino ﬂux-scale uncertainty and GENIE model-
ing uncertainties. The ﬂux normalization uncertainties
are taken to be 9.7% and 7.8% respectively for neutrino
and antineutrino [27]. The GENIE modeling uncertain-
ties were obtained by varying many parameters accord-
ing to their uncertainties in the generator. The eﬀects we
consider include the uncertainties in quasielastic scatter-
ing, resonant pion production, coherent pion production,
overlap between resonant pion production and deep in-
elastic scattering, and FSI processes. The larger back-
ground contamination and more nonresonant contribu-
tion to the signal events in the neutrino sample make it
more susceptible to the GENIE modeling uncertainties.

muons, see Fig. 9. The uncertainty on the number of ar-
gon targets is taken as 2%, which corresponds to a 4 mm
uncertainty on each dimension of the ﬁducial volume def-
inition. The uncertainty on POT is taken as 1% [24, 25].
Each generator includes models for the initial neutrino
interaction, the nuclear structure aﬀecting the initial in-
teraction, two-particle two-hole (2p2h) excitation and the
FSI of the particles produced. GENIE and NEUT use
the model of Rein and Sehgal [32] to describe pion pro-
duction. NuWro includes only the ∆(1232) resonance
according to the model [33]. NEUT takes the nonres-
onant interaction from Rein and Sehgal; GENIE and
NuWro use the model of Bodek and Yang [34] above the
resonance region and smoothly extrapolate it to lower
hadronic invariant mass (W ) to converge with the res-
onance model. For FSI, NEUT and NuWro use the
Salcedo-Oset model [35] in a cascade formalism which
has nuclear medium corrections, while GENIE uses an
eﬀective cascade model. GiBUU uses quantum-kinetic
transport theory, which allows one to include important
nuclear eﬀects such as binding potentials for hadrons
and spectral functions,
including their dynamical de-
velopment. GiBUU also requires consistency in the
sense that the description of all subprocesses, such as,
e.g., quasielastic scattering, pion production, deep in-
elastic scattering, and 2p2h interactions, is based on the
same ground state. The modeling of pion production in
GiBUU is described in detail in [36, 37].

The measured neutrino cross sections have larger sta-
tistical and systematic uncertainties compared with the
measured antineutrino cross sections because of the
larger background contamination in the neutrino sam-
ple. According to Table II, the BDT score > 0 region
is dominated by background for the νµ events. Since we
rely on MC simulations to model the background shape
in the BDT ﬁt, the result is more susceptible to the
GENIE modeling uncertainties that aﬀect various back-
ground contribution.

The GiBUU predictions are in good agreement with
the measured cross sections. The NuWro and NEUT pre-
dictions are similar to each other and both higher than
the measured cross section presented here. The GENIE
predictions appear to be higher than the other genera-
tor predictions and the measured cross sections. This is
consistent with the conclusion in [38] that GENIE’s non-
resonant background prediction has to be signiﬁcantly
reduced to ﬁt the data. We do not change any default
GENIE parameters in this analysis. All predicted inte-
grated cross sections agree with the measurements within
2 σ of the total uncertainty except the GENIE ¯νµ CC1π±
prediction which deviates from the measurement by 3.3
σ.
In general all the predictions agree better with the
measured neutrino cross sections than the measured an-
tineutrino cross sections. This is expected because there
have been a few measurements of the neutrino CC1π±
cross sections on nuclear targets but no antineutrino mea-

V. SUMMARY

This paper presents the measurements of neutrino-
and antineutrino-induced pion production on an argon
target and compares them to diﬀerent MC generators.
The ﬂux-averaged cross sections are measured to be
2.7±0.5(stat)±0.5(syst)×10−37cm2/Ar for neutrinos at
a mean energy of 9.6 GeV and 8.4 ± 0.9(stat)+1.0
−0.8(syst) ×
10−38cm2/Ar for antineutrinos at a mean energy of 3.6
GeV with the charged pion momentum above 100 MeV/c.
These measurements provide new information about the
neutrino single pion production and can be used to im-

select events where there is only one reconstructed track
in the ArgoNeuT TPC. The track is required to match to
a track in the MINOS detector. We calculate the most
probable dE/dx value using the last 5 cm of the track
in argon. We plot the distribution of dE/dx for diﬀerent
muon momenta. We tune the electric calibration factors
so that the most probable value of dE/dx as a function
of muon momentum agree with the geant prediction.
Fig. 9 shows the most probable value of dE/dx as a
function of muon momentum after the tuning of elec-
tronic calibration factors, which is in agreement with the
geant prediction shown as red curves. The shaped area
represent a 3% uncertainty on the energy scale, which is
used in the systematic analysis.

The charge deposition per unit length along the track
direction (dQ/dx) is converted to dE/dx after correcting
for the impurities in the liquid argon and recombination
eﬀects [41]. If the incident particle stops in the LArTPC
active volume, dE/dx as a function of the residual range
(R), the path length to the end point of the track, is
used as a powerful method for particle identiﬁcation. The
software calculates four χ2 values for each track by com-
paring measured dE/dx versus R points to the proton,
charged kaon, charged pion and muon hypotheses and
identiﬁes the track as the particle that gives the small-
est χ2 value. However, because of the small size of Ar-
goNeuT, many particles are not contained in the TPC,
which makes the particle identiﬁcation a challenge. The
average dE/dx of exiting tracks still provides useful in-
formation for particle identiﬁcation and is used in this
analysis.

Appendix A: Event Reconstruction

Event reconstruction is important for any LArTPC
data analysis. In this section, we describe in some de-
tail the reconstruction chain that was used to derive the
results reported in this paper. The ﬁrst step in the re-
construction is to convert the raw signal from each wire
to a standard (e.g. Gaussian) shape. This is achieved
by passing the raw data through a calibrated deconvo-
lution algorithm to remove the impact of the LArTPC
electric ﬁeld and electronics responses from the measured
signal [39].

The hit-ﬁnding algorithm scans the processed wire
waveform looking for local minima.
If a minimum is
found, the algorithm follows the waveform after this point
until it ﬁnds a local maximum. If the maximum is above
a speciﬁed threshold, the program scans to the next lo-
cal minimum and identiﬁes this region as a hit. Hits are
ﬁt with a Gaussian function whose features identify the
correct position (time coordinate), width and height and
area (deposited charge) of the hit. A single Gaussian
function is used to describe hits produced by isolated
single particles. Multiple Gaussian functions are used
to describe hits in a region where there are overlapping
particles (e.g. around neutrino interaction vertex).

Clusters are reconstructed by the TrajCluster algo-
rithm [39] as a collection of hits in the same wire plane
that may be grouped together due to proximity to one
another. TrajCluster incorporates elements of pattern
recognition and Kalman ﬁlter ﬁtting. The concept is to
construct a short “seed” trajectory of nearby hits. Addi-
tional nearby hits are attached to the leading edge of the
trajectory if they are similar to the hits already attached
to it. The similarity requirements use the impact param-
eter between the projected trajectory position and the
prospective hit, the hit width and the hit charge. This
process continues until a stopping condition is met such
as lack of hits, an abnormally high or low charge envi-
ronment, encountering a two-dimensional (2D) vertex.

Three-dimensional (3D) tracks are constructed by the
Projection Matching Algorithm (PMA) [40]. PMA builds
and optimizes objects in 3D space by minimizing the
cost function calculated simultaneously in all available
2D projections. In the conﬁguration for the ArgoNeuT
event reconstruction, PMA uses output from TrajCluster
as input and attempts also to correct hit to cluster as-
signments using properties of 3D reconstructed objects.
Vertices are also reconstructed and used to reﬁne track
reconstruction. A vertex can be the start point of an
isolated track or the intersection point of several tracks
originating from a common point.

Figure 8 shows the reconstructed quantity vs truth
quantity for the four kinematic variables we measure in
this analysis. The resolution on pµ is 9%. The resolutions
on θµ, θπ and θµπ are 1◦, 3◦ and 3◦.

The measured pulse area (ADC) is converted to the
number of electrons by an electronic calibration factor
derived using through-going muons in the LArTPC. We
