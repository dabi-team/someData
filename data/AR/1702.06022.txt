Abstract We analyze the evolution of Fe xii coronal plasma upﬂows from
the edges of ten active regions (ARs) as they cross the solar disk using the
Hinode Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). Conﬁrming the results
of D´emoulin et al. (2013, Sol. Phys. 283, 341), we ﬁnd that for each AR there is
an observed long term evolution of the upﬂows which is largely due to the solar
rotation progressively changing the viewpoint of dominantly stationary upﬂows.
From this projection eﬀect, we estimate the unprojected upﬂow velocity and its
inclination to the local vertical. AR upﬂows typically fan away from the AR core
by 40◦ to near vertical for the following polarity. The span of inclination angles

is more spread for the leading polarity with ﬂows angled from -29◦ (inclined
towards the AR center) to 28◦ (directed away from the AR). In addition to
the limb–to–limb apparent evolution, we identify an intrinsic evolution of the
upﬂows due to coronal activity which is AR dependent. Further, line widths are
correlated with Doppler velocities only for the few ARs having the largest veloc-
ities. We conclude that for the line widths to be aﬀected by the solar rotation,
the spatial gradient of the upﬂow velocities must be large enough such that the
line broadening exceeds the thermal line width of Fe xii. Finally, we ﬁnd that
upﬂows occurring in pairs or multiple pairs is a common feature of ARs observed
by Hinode/EIS, with up to four pairs present in AR 11575. This is important for
constraining the upﬂow driving mechanism as it implies that the mechanism is
not a local one occurring over a single polarity. AR upﬂows originating from
reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) between over-pressure AR
loops and neighboring under-pressure loops is consistent with upﬂows occurring
in pairs, unlike other proposed mechanisms acting locally in one polarity.

1. Introduction

1.1. General Characteristics of Active Region Upﬂows

Since the launch of the Hinode Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS),
steady coronal plasma upﬂows have been observed emanating from the edges of
active regions (ARs; Sakao et al., 2007; Harra et al., 2008). Their blue-shifted
velocities are in the range [5, 50] km s−1 for the Fe xii 195 ˚A emission line. Similar
velocities have been measured at much higher spatial resolution by the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) also using Fe xii (Testa, De Pontieu, and
Hansteen, 2016). Some ARs show large blue wing asymmetries exceeding 100
km s−1 (Bryans, Young, and Doschek, 2010; De Pontieu and McIntosh, 2010;
Tian et al., 2011; Brooks and Warren, 2012; Vanninathan et al., 2015). Upﬂow
temperatures range from 1 – 2.5 MK (Warren et al., 2011) and the Doppler
velocities increase with temperature in the corona (Del Zanna, 2008).

Typically, these large-scale upﬂows are located over monopolar regions of
strong magnetic ﬁeld (Doschek et al., 2008; Del Zanna, 2008). Upﬂowing plasma
is observed by Hinode/EIS in approximately the same locations for at least 8–9
days as ARs transit the solar disk (D´emoulin et al., 2013). Recently, Zangrilli
and Poletto (2016) have shown that the upﬂows persist for much longer periods.
Using data from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory’s Ultraviolet Coronagraph
Spectrometer (SOHO/UVCS), they demonstrated that upﬂows from AR 8100
extended into the intermediate corona to become outﬂows and persisted for the
AR’s entire lifetime which spanned ﬁve solar rotations.

1.2. Upﬂow Driving Mechanisms

Baker et al. (2009), van Driel-Gesztelyi et al. (2012), D´emoulin et al. (2013),
and Mandrini et al. (2015) have demonstrated that upﬂows occur along quasi-
separatrix layers (QSLs) which are thin 3D volumes where magnetic ﬁeld lines

SOLA: Baker_SolPhys_AR_Flows.tex; 5 March 2022; 1:42; p. 2

Active Region Upﬂows

display strong gradients in magnetic connectivity (D´emoulin et al., 1996). QSLs
are preferential locations for current sheet development and magnetic reconnec-
tion (e.g. Aulanier et al., 2006; see Janvier, 2017 for a review). QSLs are typically
present between the core of the AR and surrounding regions (including open
ﬁeld). The AR core has over-pressure loops compared to the loops in these nearby
regions. As the AR is developing, its core grows so that associated magnetic ﬁeld
motions can build current layers at the QSLs. This process is expected to drive
a long-term reconnection process (ranging from quasi-continuous to a series of
frequent small reconnection events). After reconnection, the resulting pressure
gradient drives the upﬂows along the reconnected ﬁeld lines.

A similar mechanism was proposed by Del Zanna et al. (2011) whereby
upﬂows were related to a coronal null-point of a pseudostreamer. Interchange
reconnection (i.e. taking place between AR loops and open ﬁeld lines) can take
place at the coronal null, creating a steep pressure gradient and a rarefaction
wave in the reconnected loops (Bradshaw, Aulanier, and Del Zanna, 2011). As
QSLs are the generalized form of separatrices and null points in 3D, and include
them, reconnection at these topological locations is a subset of QSL reconnection.
Clearly, magnetic reconnection is likely to play a key role in driving AR plasma
upﬂows.

Several other mechanisms have been proposed as direct or indirect drivers
of AR upﬂows observed by Hinode/EIS such as AR expansion (Murray et al.,
2010), waves (e.g. Wang et al., 2009; Verwichte et al., 2010; Ofman, Wang, and
Davila, 2012; Galsgaard et al., 2015), coronal plasma circulation (Marsch et al.,
2008), chromospheric evaporation (Del Zanna, 2008), and type II spicules (e.g.
De Pontieu et al., 2009; De Pontieu and McIntosh, 2010; Tian et al., 2012),
among others.

1.3. Paper Road Map

D´emoulin et al. (2013) used Hinode/EIS data to derive the physical properties
of the large-scale upﬂows observed on both sides of AR 10978 as it crossed the
solar disk. A least-squares ﬁtting of a stationary ﬂow model to the data provided
the means to distinguish apparent evolution due to line-of-sight projection ef-
fects from intrinsic ﬂow evolution. It was shown that the upﬂows have a strong
collimated stationary component.

In this study we apply the same analysis as in D´emoulin et al. (2013) to
nine additional ARs with good limb–to–limb EIS coverage. Section 2 provides a
pr´ecis of the steady-ﬂow model and key results from AR 10978. In Section 3 we
summarize the EIS observations in our AR sample. We analyze the limb–to–limb
Fe xii upﬂow evolution for three case studies in Section 4. Then we generalize
the results for all ARs before turning to the evolution of line widths in Section
5. We compare the inclinations of the stationary ﬂows of AR 10926 with those
of the coronal magnetic ﬁeld using a linear force-free ﬁeld extrapolation of the
AR photospheric line-of-sight (LOS) ﬁeld (Section 6). In Section 7, we show that
upﬂows in AR 11575 occur in four pairs which lets us investigate any similarity
between the two polarities of the same pair. Finally, we summarize our results
and draw our conclusions (Section 8).

2. Steady-Flow Model Applied to AR 10978

2.1. Steady-Flow Model

D´emoulin et al. (2013) analyzed the limb-to-limb evolution of plasma upﬂows
from AR 10978 using Hinode/EIS. A global evolution of the AR’s upﬂow Doppler
velocities is apparent as it crosses the solar disk from 6 – 16 December 2007.
On the AR’s eastern side, upﬂow velocities increase almost continuously with
time before reversing early on 15 December. A similar evolution takes place
on the western side but the change from increasing to decreasing upﬂow ve-
locities occurs four days earlier. Such a coherent, large-scale evolution is clear
evidence of a LOS projection eﬀect evolving with the AR’s position on the disk,
thereby demonstrating that the upﬂows have a strongly collimated stationary
component. Upﬂow velocities on either side of the AR peak when the stationary
component is parallel to the LOS of Hinode/EIS.

A stationary ﬂow model was developed to quantify the eﬀect of the evolving
LOS projection in order to separate apparent velocity evolution, due to solar
rotation, from intrinsic velocity evolution, due to some form of activity such
as ﬂux emergence, ﬂares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In applying this
simple model to EIS Doppler-velocity data of AR 10978, it was assumed that
the plasma upﬂows are continuously driven with the same velocity magnitude
and orientation in the local solar frame. The main equations of the model are
presented here for convenience. See D´emoulin et al. (2013) for a complete account
of the model and its underlying assumptions, uncertainties, and limitations.

In spherical coordinates with the radial direction [r], the longitude [ϕ], and

the latitude [θ], the velocity [V ] is:

V = Vr ˆur + Vϕ ˆuϕ + Vθ ˆuθ,

(1)

where ˆur, ˆuϕ, ˆuθ are unit vectors. The position of the ﬂow on the solar disk,
normalized to the solar radius, is given by X = sin ϕ cos θ in the east-west
direction and Y = sin θ in the north – south direction. The observed velocity
component, V(cid:107), is

2.2. Key Results - AR 10978

The inclination and angular spread of the strongest upﬂows in three coronal
lines, Si vii, Fe xii, and Fe xv (log T ≈ 5.8, 6.2, and 6.3, respectively), are
determined using the ﬂow model for AR 10978. The deduced 3D geometry of
the ﬂows is consistent with that of a thin, fan-like structure, in agreement with

a magnetic ﬁeld extrapolation of AR 10978. Fans on either side of the AR are
tilted away from its core. A coherent fan structure is found on the eastern side
(following polarity) of the AR where the strongest ﬂows are stationary, unlike on
the western side (leading polarity), where in addition to a stationary component,
there is clear intrinsic evolution related to new ﬂux emergence on the sides of
this polarity (Mandrini et al., 2015).

A similar dependence of line widths to that of Doppler velocities with respect
to position of AR 10978 on the solar disk was previously found (Doschek et al.,
2008; Bryans, Young, and Doschek, 2010). The contribution to the line width,
[W0], which is independent of the AR’s position, is very small, implying that
the line width is primarily due to a large dispersion of velocities in the direction
of the stationary ﬂows (see Section 5 of this paper and Section 4.4 of D´emoulin
et al. (2013) for a full explanation of W0). Taken in their entirety, these results
indicate that the global picture is one where the same upﬂows are detected in
a number of spectral lines at coronal temperatures. Blue-shifted plasma ﬂows
away from the AR’s core along magnetic ﬁeld lines within a narrow angular
range but with a broad velocity range. The ﬂows form a fan-like structure on
either side of the AR as the collimated upﬂows expand with increasing height
within the corona (see Figure 14 of D´emoulin et al., 2013). The upﬂow driver(s)
is(are) acting for extended periods, at least as long as the time it takes for
the AR to cross the solar disk. The location of the ﬂows within the magnetic
conﬁguration coupled with their narrow angular extent are compatible with a
ﬂow resulting from reconnection at QSLs, including separatrices (Baker et al.,
2009; Del Zanna et al., 2011; van Driel-Gesztelyi et al., 2012; D´emoulin et al.,
2013; Mandrini et al., 2015).

3. Data and Analysis Method

3.1. Observations

Nine new ARs are considered in this study, along with the results previously
found for AR 10978. Observations are from the EIS instrument on board Hinode
(Culhane et al., 2007). ARs are selected from the EIS catalog based on how
well their upﬂow regions are observed from limb to limb. In six cases, following
polarities (FPs) and leading polarities (LPs) of the ARs are covered, but for four
ARs only one polarity is within the EIS FOV throughout the disk transit time.
All of the ARs, with exception of AR 11575, have a relatively simple bipolar
magnetic structure and ﬂux distribution, which is consistent with that of ARs in
the decay phase of their lifetimes. LPs range from highly concentrated spots to
dispersed magnetic ﬁeld regions, while FPs consist of only dispersed ﬁeld with
the exception of AR 10978 which contains coherent spots in both. Nine of the
ten ARs are classiﬁed as large, with a total unsigned ﬂux greater than 5 × 1021
Mx (van Driel-Gesztelyi and Green, 2015).

NOAA number, Solar Object Locator (SOL) at the date and time of central
meridian passage (CMP), and estimated minimum AR age are given in Table 1.
It is not possible to directly determine the age of any of the ARs since none were
observed during ﬂux emergence. Instead, we provide a minimum age of the ARs
solely based on when they are ﬁrst detected at the Sun’s East limb or on the far-
side using observations of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
A and B spacecraft. Minimum ages range from 7 to 23 days. The description
of magnetic ﬂux distribution for LPs and FPs, and total AR unsigned ﬂux at
CMP are given in Table 2. Information and results pertaining to AR 10978 from
D´emoulin et al. (2013) are included in the tables of this article for comparison
purposes.

Active Region Upﬂows

3.2. Data Reduction

The rastered images are constructed with the 1” and 2” slits in the scanning
mode. A total of 24 diﬀerent EIS studies with varying exposure times, ﬁelds of
view (FOV), and spectral line lists are used in this investigation. See Table 4
of the Appendix for EIS study details including study number, FOV, slit size,
exposure time, and total raster time. Data reduction is performed with standard
SolarSoft EIS routines which correct for dark current, hot, warm, and dusty
pixels, detector bias, and cosmic rays. Further corrections are made for slit tilt
and spectrum drift due to temperature variation throughout the spacecraft’s
orbit.

Coronal spectral line proﬁles have been shown to have an extended blue wing
in the upﬂow regions for a few ARs, e.g. AR 10978 in Bryans, Young, and
Doschek (2010) and Brooks and Warren (2012), AR 10938 in Hara et al. (2008)
and Peter (2010), both of which are included in our AR study, and AR 11123
in Vanninathan et al. (2015). All of these authors required a second velocity
component to ﬁt the asymmetric Fe xii–xv proﬁles as they found signiﬁcant
deviations from single Gaussian ﬁts. In most cases, a double Gaussian ﬁt was
suﬃcient to disentangle the primary and secondary velocity components of the
AR upﬂows. Typical primary component velocities were 5–20 km s−1, whereas
the secondary component velocities exceeded 100 km s−1 in all cases. Enhanced
blue wing velocities have been linked to, among other phenomena, jets (e.g.
Vanninathan et al., 2015) and type II spicules (e.g. McIntosh and De Pontieu,
2009; Peter, 2010). In D´emoulin et al. (2013), the results of double Gaussian
ﬁttings of the faster ﬂows of AR 10978 could be trusted for a very limited number
of pixels where upﬂow velocities were high enough to separate the secondary
and primary components and where the emission measure was large enough to
provide a reliable secondary component. For the other ARs in our study the
variety of exposure times in the range 5 – 70 s proved to be problematic for
consistently separating the components for all data sets.

In addition to enhanced blue wings, the Fe xii 195.12 ˚A line is blended with
Fe xii at 195.18 ˚A. The self-blend must be taken into account in regions of high
density > 1010 cm−3, e.g. in AR cores (Young et al., 2009); however, in upﬂow
regions densities are typically (cid:46) 109 cm−3 (Bryans, Young, and Doschek, 2010;
Culhane et al., 2014) so that we can ignore the eﬀects of this blend. Hence, in the
study presented here, single Gaussian functions are ﬁtted to the Fe xii spectra
in order to determine the total line intensity, the line width (full width at half
maximum, FWHM), and the centroid wavelength.

3.3. Deriving Steady Flows

We apply the steady-ﬂow model summarized in Section 2.1 to upﬂow streams
associated with the LPs and/or FPs of all ARs in our study. If the ﬂows are
stationary and well collimated, the observed velocity from a given location within
the AR is described by the model (Equation (2)). However, upﬂows have an
unknown 3D geometry in the corona and therefore it is not possible to follow an
upﬂow coming from a ﬁxed AR location (within the local solar frame). Instead,

Figure 1. Diagram to illustrate the sign and the typical range of the inclination angle [δ] of
the upﬂows with respect to the vertical for the leading (LP) and following polarities (FP) of
an AR. The arrows show possible directions of the mean upﬂow velocity [V ] in each polarity.

we proceed statistically over a full upﬂow region. If this region is deﬁned by a
given isocontour of V(cid:107), its extent is modiﬁed by the projection along the LOS
(the selected region would be larger as the velocity is more along the LOS).
As a collimated upﬂow region has a relatively small extension in latitude and
longitude and therefore V(cid:107) is aﬀected by a similar projection factor, the region(s)
with the strongest ﬂows is(are) essentially independent of the projection. In
practice, only a ﬁxed number of pixels with the strongest upﬂows are retained.
This does not fully disentangle the eﬀect of the variable extension with the
evolving projection but it is the most satisfactory method we have found (see
Section 2.4 of D´emoulin et al., 2013). We experimented with the number of data
points from each raster observation in the range 20 – 100. We ﬁnd that the eﬀect
on the derived mean velocities, line widths, and inclination angles is weak, which
is consistent with the ﬁndings of D´emoulin et al. (2013).

A classical convention is that V(cid:107) is positive for ﬂows going away from the
observer, so upﬂows have V(cid:107) < 0. For convenience, plots show -V(cid:107), i.e. positive
values. The highest 50 values are selected in each data set and the least-squares
ﬁtting to Equation (2) is applied to these data points. Mean velocity [V ], mean
line width [W ], and mean inclination angle [δ] are determined from the ﬁts for
all available upﬂow regions. The angle δ measures the east-west inclination of
the ﬂows to the local vertical with the same sign convention in the FP and LP
(Figure 1). The notations are the same as in D´emoulin et al. (2013) where more
explanations can be found.

4. Steady-Flow Model Results

Examples of the ﬁtting to the steady-ﬂow model for selected ARs are displayed
in Figure 2. In the left panels, -V(cid:107) vs. the X position is plotted for four cases.

eﬀects using the ﬁtted curves in the corresponding panels on the left. Red lines
represent the mean values of the ﬁt diﬀerences and the black lines are ± one
standard deviation. This gives a straightforward view on the ﬂuctuation level and
provides a direct way to identify intrinsic activity (see for example red arrow in
Figure 2h). At the top of the plots we indicate two measures of the variation of
the data values: the standard deviation [σt] of all mean values (shown in red in
the panels) and the mean of the standard deviation [< σobs >] for each data set.
They measure the ﬂuctuations of the mean velocities with time and the mean
value of the spatial ﬂuctuations, respectively (for the largest velocities).

In the following subsections, we use the least-squares ﬁtting of the stationary
ﬂow model to distinguish apparent from intrinsic ﬂow evolution. Deviations of
the data from the model indicate the temporal evolution of the ﬂows. We give a
brief account of the results for two ARs that have large and small values of the
derived velocities, respectively, yet both display a dominant apparent evolution.
Then we look in more detail at an AR where an eruption occurred during its
disk transit.

4.1. Apparent Evolution - AR 11589 and AR 10961

Hinode/EIS observed the western upﬂow region of AR 11589 from 10 – 17 Octo-
ber 2012. Throughout this period, the dispersing magnetic ﬂux of both polarities

SOLA: Baker_SolPhys_AR_Flows.tex; 5 March 2022; 1:42; p. 10

Active Region Upﬂows

spreads over an ever-increasing area. The decaying AR has a bipolar magnetic
conﬁguration. Loops originating in the upﬂow region over the positive polarity
(FP) connect externally with the negative polarity of the nearby AR 11592 to the
north – east and the surrounding quiet Sun. The upﬂow region on the negative
polarity (LP) extends into the negative ﬁeld of a coronal hole immediately to
the west. Activity is steady with 23 C-class ﬂares attributed to the AR; however,
no signiﬁcant internal ﬂux emergence or CMEs are detected.

The steady-ﬂow model ﬁt and the deviation from the ﬁtting are shown in
Figures 2a and 2b, respectively. From the curvature of the black line in the left
plot, it is clear that the limb-to-limb evolution of upﬂows of the LP is dominated
by the eﬀects of the velocities projected onto the LOS. The derived mean velocity
is 41 km s−1, which is the strongest in our study. The error of this parameter,
derived from the ﬁtted parameters, is estimated to be ±0.6 km s−1. Overall,
the model ﬁt is very stable as the mean values of the ﬁt diﬀerences (red line in
Figure 2b) are (cid:46) 5 km s−1 until the AR approaches the western limb, where
there are no data beyond approximately the +0.5 normalized AR position. The
temporal dispersion [σt] is 3.4 km s−1 and the spatial mean dispersion [< σobs >]
is 1.9 km s−1, so a factor 10 and 20 times smaller than the mean velocity.

Both polarities of AR 10961 were observed by Hinode/EIS from 27 June to 6
July 2007. For most of the transit time, the isolated AR magnetic conﬁguration
is bipolar, though unlike AR 11589, its LP contains a strong, coherent spot. Its
total unsigned ﬂux is 5.9 × 1021 Mx. Activity is limited to a few jets and B-class
ﬂares in close proximity to the upﬂow region on the LP. In Figure 2, middle
panels, the upﬂow streams on both sides of the AR exhibit a moderately strong
dependence of V(cid:107) on the normalized X-position of the AR. The mean velocity
for the FP is 17.0 ± 0.2 km s−1 and 11.0 ± 0.3 km s−1 for the LP. The model ﬁts
are very good on either side of the AR. Values of σt and < σobs > are similar for
each polarity and much lower than those for AR 11589, while the values relative
to the mean velocity are comparable.

In summary, AR 11589 and AR 10961 upﬂows exhibit a strongly collimated
stationary component as they cross the solar disk so that the observed evolution
is dominantly due to projection. This is the case for both low (AR 10961) and
high (AR 11589) -V(cid:107) values. In our data sample, this result is also present for
the other ARs exhibiting low levels of activity.

4.2. Intrinsic Evolution - AR 10953

AR 10953 crossed the solar disk from 25 April to 6 May 2007. The AR had a
simple bipolar conﬁguration with a concentrated leading sunspot and dispersed
FP. No signiﬁcant ﬂux emergence was observed. Flaring activity was limited to
two C-class ﬂares; however, there were several ﬁlament eruptions. Two of them
occurred at 18:30 UT and 23:12 UT on 2 May (Okamoto et al., 2008; Su et al.,
2009). Figure 3 shows STEREO B 195 ˚A intensity and running diﬀerence images
before and during the ﬁrst eruption towards the southern edge of the AR. The
images are taken from the included STEREO B movie, called Movie 1.

There was extensive Hinode/EIS coverage of the upﬂow regions on both sides
of the AR. On the east side, where the magnetic ﬁeld is dispersed, there are

two distinct upﬂow areas (AR 10953 (N) and (S) in Table 3). The stationary
ﬂow model results for the FP southern region are displayed in the bottom pan-
els of Figure 2. Once again, there is an apparent ﬂow evolution as is evident
from the black line of the model ﬁt (left panel). The derived mean velocity is
15.0 ± 0.3 km s−1, similar to values of V(cid:107) found for AR 10961. Variations of the
velocities around the ﬁtted values are comparable to those in AR 11589, with
σt = 3.7 km s−1 and < σobs >= 1.6 km s−1 while the values relative to the
mean velocity are a factor two higher than in the two previous ARs. Indeed,
large velocities, deviating signiﬁcantly from the ﬁt, are observed when the AR
is at approximately 0.1 – 0.3 in X after CMP (indicated by the arrows in Figure
2g,h). This position corresponds to the two times when ﬁlaments erupted from
the AR. Both eruptions appear to occur in the vicinity of the southern (FP)
upﬂow region close to the EIS raster times. The eﬀect of the ﬁlament eruptions
is clearly indicated by the signiﬁcant deviation of the velocity data points from
the steady-ﬂow model ﬁt in Figure 2g and in the increase in variation around the
ﬁtted values up to 15 km s−1 in Figure 2h. The deviation from the model ﬁt is
evidence of intrinsic ﬂow evolution in AR 10953. Notwithstanding the ﬁlament
eruptions, upﬂows are very stable during the AR limb-to-limb transit.

4.3. General Results

We have shown the model ﬁts for three examples in order to demonstrate the
various conditions under which upﬂows persist in ARs. In fact, these results are
general to the ARs in our study since all of them have stationary ﬂows over
the LPs and FPs which are observed by Hinode/EIS for 8–9 days during disk
transit. Stationary ﬂows are likely to persist for much longer as the ﬂows are
seen in ARs with minimum ages that exceed the transit time. This is the case
for half of the ARs in our study (see Table 1 for AR minimum ages).

Derived mean velocities are in the range [9,41] km s−1 and, where both polari-
ties are observed by Hinode/EIS, the velocities are similar (see Table 3). Overall,
the model ﬁts are quite robust with the ﬂuctuation of velocities around the
ﬁtted values typically within ±1/10 of the mean velocity, except when signiﬁcant
activity is present. Intrinsic stationary ﬂow evolution due to activity such as ﬂux
emergence, ﬂaring, and eruptions is indicated by deviations from the model ﬁts,
as is shown with AR 10953 (Figure 2g and 2h). Such periods of activity are
easily identiﬁed from the residual velocities to the ﬁt and are removed from the
data set. Then the ﬁt is performed again to derive the velocity parameters and
the standard deviations outside the activity periods (Table 3).

The derived inclination angles of upﬂows for all ARs are given in Table 3.
AR upﬂows typically fan away from the AR core by 40◦ to near vertical (4◦) for
the dispersed FPs. The spread of inclination angles is more extensive for LPs
with ﬂows angled from 29◦ inclined towards to 28◦ directed away from the AR.
However, with the exception of AR 10926 and AR 10961 (one of the two LP
upﬂows), values of δ are consistent with those of the FPs, i.e. ﬂows are tilted
away from the AR.

5. Line Widths

Stationary ﬂow model analysis of the Fe xii spectral line width [W ] was per-
formed by ﬁtting the data with

W = W0 + W (cid:48)
r

(cid:112)

1 − X 2 − Y 2 − Wϕ

X
1 − Y 2

(3)

where X is the east-west normalized AR position, W0 is a constant which in-
cludes all width contributions independent of position, W (cid:48)
r takes into account the
ﬂow dispersion in radial and latitudinal directions, similar to V (cid:48)
r in Equation (2),
and Wϕ does the same in the longitudinal direction (see Section 4.4 in D´emoulin
et al., 2013). Line widths free of instrumental broadening are given as FWHM
in ˚A.

Model ﬁts for two extreme cases are shown in Figure 4. AR 11389 FP (Figure
4b and 4d) exhibits a relatively strong dependence of line width evolution on X,
as is the case with LOS upﬂow velocity. Little activity was evident in this AR
after its ﬁrst few days on the disk (Baker et al., 2015).

Conversely, AR 10926 LP has a weak dependence of line width on X (Figure
4d) compared to the dependence present in V(cid:107) (Figure 4c). Signiﬁcant and

persistent ﬂux emergence occurs when the AR is in the western hemisphere,
thus introducing coronal perturbations which dominate the rotational eﬀects in
W .

2 + W 2

The quantity (W (cid:48)
r

ϕ)1/2/W0 represents the relative eﬀect of the rotation
over W0, which is the contribution to line width not aﬀected by solar rotation.
Columns 4 and 5 of Table 3 give values for the FP and the LP of all ARs
where available. AR polarities with values approaching or exceeding unity have
relatively strong rotational eﬀects on line widths. In such cases, these eﬀects can
be detected above W0, which includes thermal width (0.022 ˚A for Fe xii) and
intrinsic ﬂuctuations. Occasionally, the variations of W are falsely interpreted by
the ﬁt, e.g. for AR 10942 FP which presents an upward-curved ﬁt. For another
example, AR 11575 (N) FP, the ﬁts yield a non-physical result because W0 < 0.
This may occur when signiﬁcant activity is present.

In general, the eﬀect of rotation on W appears to be weaker than on V(cid:107). A
case in point is AR 11564 which has strong apparent velocities of 30 km s−1 for
both polarities; however, the rotational eﬀects are marginal for the FP, while
they are strong for the LP. Following the proposal of D´emoulin et al. (2013), the
sensitivity of W to rotational eﬀects is expected to be due to the Doppler velocity
diﬀerences within the same Hinode/EIS pixel. The distribution of the velocities
increases the observed line width. For collimated ﬂows, this eﬀect has also a

Active Region Upﬂows

positional dependence due to the projection along the line of sight. For many
of the ARs in our study, the diﬀerential eﬀect is weaker than the mean eﬀect
of the global line shift (due to the mean plasma velocity) and as a consequence
may not be large enough to stand visible above W0. This implies that rotational
eﬀects can be masked easily even without any activity. The addition of activity
increases W0, and transforms W (cid:48)
r and Wϕ, masking further the eﬀect of solar
rotation. Finally, as is the case with V , we ﬁnd no relation between the values
of W and the age of the ARs (c.f. Table 1 to Table 3).

6. Comparison of Deduced Inclinations and LFFF

Extrapolation of AR 10926

We compute the magnetic ﬁeld topology of AR 10926 during its disk transit on
30 November 2006 at 16:25 UT, 1 December at 16:28 UT, and 3 December at
15:32 UT. The LOS magnetic ﬁeld is extrapolated to the corona using a constant
α linear force-free ﬁeld (LFFF) conﬁguration where J ×B = 0 and ∇ ×B = αB
(D´emoulin et al., 1997). Figure 5, left panel, shows the LFFF model results
for 1 December when the AR was close to CMP. Similar results are found at
other times. As in D´emoulin et al. (2013), the inclination deduced from the
stationary ﬂow model is compared with that of the LFFF extrapolation. Field
lines rooted in the strong upﬂow region of the FP form two groups, one of which
connects to the LP within the AR and the other group connects outside of the
computational box (pink and black ﬁeld lines, respectively, in Figure 5). The
ranges of inclination angles are [-40◦, -10◦] for the pink and [-60◦, -40◦] for the
black ﬁeld lines. Unusually, compared to other ARs, inclination angles of the LP
are within the range [-20◦, 10◦] with a number of ﬁeld lines inclined to the east,
i.e. towards the center of the AR.

The deduced inclinations [δ] from EIS velocities reﬂect the asymmetry of
the opposite polarities in the extrapolation and coronal observations with in-
clinations for FP of δ = −40 ± 1◦ and for LP of δ = −12 ± 2◦, i.e. both
inclined toward the east. Qualitatively, the steady-ﬂow model and extrapolation
inclination angles are broadly comparable, however, there is a large range of
inclinations in the extrapolations.

Sources of discrepancies between EIS upﬂow and magnetic extrapolation de-

duced directions may be due to a number of factors:
i ) We derive the mean inclination of the strongest ﬂows over many days compared
to a single snapshot of a model representing all AR ﬁeld line populations.
ii ) The photospheric footpoints of the ﬂows are diﬃcult to estimate so the corre-
spondence with the computed QSLs and the selected ﬁeld lines is approximate.
iii ) Activity such as the ﬂux emergence observed in this AR can inﬂuence the
derived parameters of the steady-ﬂow model.
iv ) LFFF extrapolations are computed assuming constant α, however, the AR
ﬁeld may have varying α values as it evolves during disk transit. This is the case
for AR 10926 (extrapolations not shown here).

The above source of discrepancies between EIS upﬂow directions and com-
puted ﬁeld lines are present for all ARs, with only diﬀerences in the relative

importance of the above factors. Globally we can only expect a broad coherence
between the derived inclinations from both data sources.

7. Upﬂow Pairs - AR 11575

Three ARs in our sample have more than a single pair of upﬂow streams that
are ﬁtted with the stationary ﬂow model. AR 10953 ﬂows can be divided into
northern and southern streams. AR 10961 has two upﬂow regions on the western
side. AR 11575 has four distinct ﬂow pairs, one each in the northern, central,
and southern areas within the AR, and one to the far south which is present
only during the later EIS observations. Model results are provided in Table 3.

Here we focus on AR 11575 which is featured in Figure 6 and Movie 2, both
of which are composed of observations from the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager
(HMI) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). The AR is complex, formed by several bipoles which are
evident in the HMI magnetograms. In addition, loops rooted in the positive FP
are connected to both the AR LP and to the negative polarity of the nearby
AR 11577 located on the eastern side of AR 11575 (see Movie 2). The strong
connectivity between the ARs aﬀects the eastern upﬂows, which diﬀer from the
typical ﬂow regions observed in the isolated, simple bipolar ARs in our sample.
Parts of the upﬂows are located at the border of the extended FP rather than
directly over the FP.

Individual ﬂow pairs are identiﬁed in the Doppler velocity maps and are indi-
cated by boxes in Figure 7 showing Hinode/EIS Fe xii intensity and Doppler ve-
locity maps with corresponding SDO/HMI magnetograms for 23 and 28 Septem-
ber. On 23 September, there are three ﬂow pairs and on 28 September, additional

boxes. The image is extracted from Movie 2.

upﬂow streams appear together to the far south of the AR. Upﬂows occur over
pairs of opposite polarity magnetic ﬁeld patches. To the north, upﬂows occur at
the base of long, close to potential loops connecting regions of dispersed magnetic
ﬁeld. Short, compact loops within the AR core connect the intact leading spot
with the FP. To the south, the upﬂows occur in sheared loops connecting to very
weak dispersed ﬁeld.

We are able to ﬁt the model to the three pairs observed on 23 September but
there are too few data to ﬁt the southernmost pair. Derived model velocities are
highly comparable within these upﬂows with [FP, LP] velocities as follows: V =
[12, 12] for the northern pair, V = [12, 16] for the central pair, and V = [11, 23]
for the southern pair. The derived V values for the northern and southern pairs
are likely to be under-evaluated because we do not have measurements of the
components of V in the north – south direction. Moreover, the model inclinations
may not be well estimated due to the relatively low number of rasters available
on the eastern side before CMP. The near vertical inclination angle of the FP
upﬂow of the southern pair (see Table 3) is likely to be the result of a combination
of the connectivity with AR 11577 and the low data coverage where X < 0.

Despite the complex conﬁguration of AR 11575, its ﬂow pairs exhibit strong
apparent evolution comparable to that of AR 11589 and AR 10961 shown in
Figure 2. This is also the case with the separate ﬂows and ﬂow pairs identiﬁed
in AR 10953 and AR 10961. In fact, for six of the ten ARs where both polarities
are observed, the mean velocities derived from the model ﬁts for each associated
LP and FP are remarkably similar (see Section 4.3 and Table 3).

upﬂow pairs corresponding to diﬀerent magnetic bipoles. Axes have units of arcsecs. Color bar

Our results indicate that the origin of the upﬂow pairs is related. It is unlikely
that consistently similar ﬂow velocities occurring on both sides of the ARs would
be maintained for time scales of days/weeks unless the stationary ﬂows are driven
by a large-scale, global mechanism rather than a local one acting at a single polar-
ity. AR upﬂows originating from reconnection along QSLs between over-pressure
AR loops and nearby under-pressure loops is consistent with such a mechanism
as QSLs are deﬁned by the global properties of the magnetic conﬁguration of
the AR and its surroundings (D´emoulin, 2007). Moreover, Mandrini et al. (2015)
showed that the upﬂows and QSLs evolve in parallel, both temporarily and
spatially.

8. Summary and Conclusions

The aim of this study is to use Hinode/EIS data to constrain the geometry
and nature of large-scale upﬂows present on both sides of ARs. We use the
simple stationary-ﬂow model applied to AR 10978 in D´emoulin et al. (2013)
to deduce the mean velocity [V ], mean line width [W ], and inclination angle
[δ] for nine ARs with reasonable limb-to-limb EIS coverage. By separating and
characterizing apparent from intrinsic upﬂow evolution we set constraints on
the mechanisms which are able to drive these large scale, persistent upﬂows.
Our main results are:

•

•

• All ARs in our study have stationary ﬂows. As a consequence, the observed
long-term evolution of the collimated, large-scale, and persistent ﬂows is
largely due to the evolution of the LOS projection during disk transit.
In most cases, derived velocities [V ] for the following and leading polarities
are similar. This holds for asymmetric ARs (e.g. AR 10926 and AR 10961)
indicating that magnetic ﬁeld strength is not driving the stationary ﬂows,
i.e. there is no direct magnetic acceleration like with CMEs.
In general, ARs with stronger ﬂows, i.e. higher mean line-of-sight velocities,
show stronger rotational eﬀects.
Intrinsic ﬂow evolution due to activity, such as ﬂux emergence, jets, ﬂaring,
and CMEs, appears as a deviation from the model ﬁt (e.g. AR 10953,
Figure 2g and 2h). However, since such phenomena have diﬀerent time
scales, ranging from few tens of minutes (ﬂares) to days (emergence), they
aﬀect diﬀerently the observed velocity. They also aﬀect the estimated steady
ﬂow with diﬀerent amplitudes, CMEs having the largest imprint. However,
because of the diﬀerent time scales, they can be identiﬁed in the velocity
data and removed to derive the upﬂow properties.

•

• Our study demonstrates there is no evidence of a relationship between ﬂow
evolution and AR age which is consistent with the results of Zangrilli and
Poletto (2016) who found with SOHO/UVCS that upﬂows remain for the
entire lifetime of an AR.

• The eﬀect of solar rotation on line width [W ] is clearly present but weaker
compared with its eﬀect on V for the nine new ARs in our study. This con-
trasts with the strong dependence of both V and W on AR position in the
case of AR10978 (Doschek et al., 2008; Bryans, Young, and Doschek, 2010;
D´emoulin et al., 2013). The line broadening dependence on AR position
is likely to be due to a large dispersion of velocities along the main ﬂow
direction. This eﬀect is weaker than the global line shift so that thermal
width and activity can easily mask the rotational eﬀects on W .

• For the set of studied ARs, in the following polarity δ = [0◦, 40◦] is tilted
away from the AR core. The leading polarity inclinations have a greater
spread with δ = [-33◦, 28◦] such that the leading-polarity upﬂows tilt both
towards and away from the center of the AR.

• Deduced inclination angles [δ] for both polarities of AR 10926 are broadly
comparable to those obtained from a LFFF extrapolation of the AR. The δ
results of the stationary-ﬂow model reﬂect the asymmetric topology of the
AR evident in the extrapolation and coronal observations.

•

Independent ﬂow pairs identiﬁed in three more complex ARs display ap-
parent evolution, similar to the simple, isolated bipolar ARs in the sample.
The upﬂows appear in pairs with similar velocities in the following and
leading AR polarities which hints that the same process is taking place at
both polarities of the same pair.

Blue-shifted upﬂows are a common feature of ARs observed by Hinode/EIS
throughout its ten-year mission. Our results imply that the stationary compo-
nent of upﬂows occurring on either side of ARs are in fact related. Moreover,
stationary ﬂows occur in pairs whether the ARs are isolated bipoles common
at solar minimum or more complex, interconnected multipolar regions observed
during solar maximum. This result constrains the possible upﬂow driving mech-
anisms. Mechanisms acting locally at one polarity, e.g. waves, nanoﬂares, or jets,
are unlikely to produce globally stationary upﬂows with the same characteristics
unless they are synchronized by another mechanism such as magnetic reconnec-
tion. Indeed our results are in agreement with a model where reconnection occurs
along quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) between over-pressure AR loops and neigh-
boring under-pressure loops (Baker et al., 2009; Bradshaw, Aulanier, and Del
Zanna, 2011; Del Zanna et al., 2011; van Driel-Gesztelyi et al., 2012; D´emoulin
et al., 2013; Mandrini et al., 2015).
