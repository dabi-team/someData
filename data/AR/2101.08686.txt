Abstract The Aria project consists of a plant, hosting a
350 m cryogenic isotopic distillation column, the tallest ever
built, which is currently in the installation phase in a mine
shaft at Carbosulcis S.p.A., Nuraxi-Figus (SU), Italy. Aria is
one of the pillars of the argon dark-matter search experimen-
tal program, lead by the Global Argon Dark Matter Collab-
oration. Aria was designed to reduce the isotopic abundance
of 39Ar, a β -emitter of cosmogenic origin, whose activity
poses background and pile-up concerns in the detectors, in
the argon used for the dark-matter searches, the so-called
Underground Argon (UAr). In this paper, we discuss the re-
quirements, design, construction, tests, and projected per-
formance of the plant for the isotopic cryogenic distillation
of argon. We also present the successful results of isotopic
cryogenic distillation of nitrogen with a prototype plant, op-
erating the column at total reﬂux.

1 Introduction

Large liquid argon detectors offer one of the best avenues
for detecting galactic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMPs) via their scattering on atomic nuclei. However, at-
mospheric argon (AAr) has a naturally occurring radioactive
isotope, 39Ar, of isotopic abundance of 8 × 10−16 in mass,
which is a β -emitter of cosmogenic origin, and whose ac-
tivity of about 1 Bq/kg raises background and pile-up con-
cerns. Indeed, the liquid argon target allows for powerful
discrimination between nuclear and electron recoil scintilla-
tion signals via pulse-shape discrimination [1–3], provided
the background rate is not too high. However, this discrimi-
nation method cannot be applied in experiments that look at
the ionization signal only [4, 5]. The use of argon extracted
from underground wells, the so-called Underground Argon

ae-mail: ds-ed@lngs.infn.it

(UAr), with a highly suppressed content of 39Ar, is there-
fore pivotal for the physics potential of dark matter search
experiments.

The DarkSide-50 experiment, a liquid argon time projec-
tion chamber (LAr TPC) at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran
Sasso (LNGS), used a 150 kg active mass of UAr extracted
from CO2 wells in Cortez, CO, USA, and measured the 39Ar
Depletion Factor (DF) with respect to AAr to be 1400 ±
200 [2]. A new production chain, that was recently set up to
signiﬁcantly increase the production of UAr. This new pro-
duction needs to meet the target requirements of the Global
Argon Dark Matter Collaboration (GADMC), a worldwide
effort that uniﬁes the DarkSide, DEAP-3600, MiniCLEAN,
and ArDM experimental groups, for the construction of new
experiments for argon dark-matter searches. In order of in-
creasing size, these new experiments are a potential Dark-
SideLowMass, with approximately 1 t target, optimized for
the detection of low-mass dark matter, aiming at improving
the world-leading results of the DarkSide-50 experiment [4,
5], the 51.1 t target mass DarkSide-20k [6], under construc-
tion at LNGS, Italy, and the prospected Argo, of 400 t tar-
get mass, that will push the experimental sensitivity down
to the so-called neutrino ﬂoor. The argon procurement for
this new production chain starts from the Urania plant, now
in the construction phase in Cortez, CO, USA, that will ex-
tract and purify UAr at a maximum production rate of about
330 kg/d. The 39Ar radioactivity of UAr, though remarkably
lower than that of AAr, is neither low enough for the needs
of the DarkSide-LowMass experiment, where it would be
the limiting background to the cross-section sensitivity, nor
for the Argo experiment, where it would cause a major event
pile-up, if built with the double-phase TPC technology.

The cryogenic isotopic distillation plant Aria, which is
currently in the installation phase in a mine shaft at Carbo-
Sulcis S.p.A., in Nuraxi-Figus (SU), Italy, was designed to
further reduce the 39Ar isotopic fraction of the UAr by an-

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

other factor of 10 per pass, with a production rate of several
kg/d. While the 350 m tall, 31.8 cm inner diameter, distilla-
tion column under construction ﬁts the needs of DarkSide-
LowMass in terms of production rate, for the larger Argo
experiment a new wider column would need to be built.

Cryogenic isotopic distillation with rectifying columns
is a well established technique [7] and has received quite
some attention in the context of the stable isotope separa-
tion of the main biogenic elements such as carbon and oxy-
gen and some industrial-scale plants have already been built.
However, for argon isotopic distillation, this is the ﬁrst time
that such a plant is proposed and constructed. In addition to
cryogenic distillation, a few other techniques are currently
available for the separation of argon isotopes, based on the
difference in molecular mass, such as centrifugal separation
and diffusion separation, the latter based on the different av-
erage speed, at thermal equilibrium, among isotopes of the
same energy. However, their application is limited by the
low yield and the high cost per unit mass of separated iso-
topes. As a matter of fact, the cryogenic isotopic distillation
plant Aria appears as a very promising new avenue for the
depletion from 39Ar of such large quantities of argon, at rea-
sonable cost and time. It is interesting to note that target pu-
riﬁcation via distillation, though not isotopic, with cryogenic
columns in the context of dark matter search detectors was
also pursued by other collaborations using xenon [8–11].

The technological capability to achieve efﬁcient isotopic
separation with cryogenic distillation allows to widen the
application of the Aria project to other ﬁelds, where the pro-
duction of stable isotopes is required, such as e.g. in med-
ical applications. However, in this paper we will focus on
the application of the Aria plant to the isotopic distillation
of argon.

A very important achievement for this project was a ni-
trogen distillation run of the prototype plant, a short ver-
sion of the Aria column using only the reboiler, the con-
denser and one central module, together with all the aux-
iliary equipment of the full column, installed in a surface
building. The successful outcome of this run paved the way
to the continuation of the project and the construction of the
full plant.

2 Design requirements

Isotopic separation by cryogenic distillation exploits the rel-
ative volatility of different isotopes, namely, for ideal mix-
tures, the ratio of their vapor pressures at a given tempera-
ture. Continuous distillation, with a large number of distil-
lation stages, where the liquid and vapor phases undergo a
countercurrent exchange at thermodynamic equilibrium, is
used to optimize the separation of isotopes that have relative
volatility close to unity. As detailed in Sect. 3, heat is con-
stantly provided from a bottom heat exchanger, in the so-

called reboiler, that vaporizes the liquid, and extracted from
a top heat exchanger, in the so-called condenser, that con-
denses the vapor. To perform the isotopic separation, the col-
umn temperature ranges between the boiling point of 40Ar
(bottom) and of 39Ar (top) at the operating pressure, slightly
above 1 bar. The pre-cooled UAr feed enters the column at
a given height and ﬂow. The vapor rises in the column and
re-condenses, while the liquid sinks by gravity and then re-
boils. In the rectifying section (above the feed point), the
molar fraction of 39Ar is larger than in the feed argon, while
in the stripping section (below the feed point) it is smaller
than in the feed argon. Liquid argon depleted of 39Ar is
then collected continuously from the bottom of the column,
whereas argon enriched of 39Ar is collected from the top.
Since the 39Ar has a very low isotopic fraction even in at-
mospheric argon, its volatility relative to the other argon
isotopes was never measured. Therefore, for the column de-
sign, the relative volatility of 39Ar to 40Ar, or its more com-
monly used natural logarithm, ln(α39−40), was derived from
the measured relative volatility of 36Ar to 40Ar, which is
0.0060 ± 0.0001 [12], at the mean operating temperature of
the column of 89.5 K, as shown in Sect. 3. According to
the model of [13], the dependence of ln(αA−40) on the iso-
topic mass A is ln(αA−40) ∝ (40 − A)/A. This means that,
at 89.5 K, ln(α39−40) is about 0.0014 and α39−40 is about
1.0014, which is the value assumed for all the calculations
in this paper. The uncertainty coming from model extrapola-
tion is however difﬁcult to estimate and therefore this num-
ber should be taken as an approximate value. The tempera-
ture dependence of α39−40 turns out to be about -0.00005/K.

The relative volatility of two species provides an esti-
mate of how difﬁcult it is to separate two species. Since
this ratio is close to 1 for 39Ar and 40Ar, the separation
is expected to be very difﬁcult. To optimize the distillation
process, the Aria column makes use of a high performance
packing material instead of the distillation trays. The two re-
lated quantities that characterize the separation capability of
distillation columns are the number of equivalent theoretical
trays, NT , (in a distillation columns the N theoretical stages
consist of the NT theoretical trays with the eventual addition
of the reboiler and the condenser, in the case they represent
equilibrium stages) and the Height Equivalent to a Theoret-
ical Plate, HETP, the product of the two yielding the total
column height.

In the Aria distillation column, for a binary mixture, the
minimum number of theoretical stages needed, Nmin, at total
reﬂux is given by the Fenske equation [14]:

where xD is the molar fraction of 39Ar in the top, xB the
molar fraction of 39Ar in the bottom, and xD, xB (cid:28) 1.

Requiring for instance a separation of 10, from eq. (1) it
follows that Nmin=1645. Moreover, when the column oper-
ates in ﬁnite reﬂux mode, the number of required stages is
larger than Nmin. To include such a large number of stages,
the column needs to be very tall and be ﬁlled with high per-
formance packing, i.e. with a small HETP. Moreover, for ef-
ﬁcient use of the packing, there is a limitation on the liquid
ﬂow per unit area, usually speciﬁed by the vendor. Therefore
not only the height but also the diameter matters for sizeable
distillate production.

To support such a tall column, a convenient and cheap
solution was found with its installation in an underground
vertical mineshaft of 5 m diameter and 350 m depth, dug in
the 1940s, which was made available to Aria by the end of
the mine coal extraction cycle, at the end of 2018.

The ﬁrst phase of the Aria project, which is the sub-
ject of this paper, consists of a column of internal diameter
d=31.8 cm, with 3 mm wall thickness, enclosed in a vacuum
cold box of 71.1 cm diameter, with a total height approxi-
mately equal to the mineshaft depth. The support structure
of the column in the shaft is designed in a way to allow for
the installation at later times of a wider column with a max-
imum cold box diameter of 2.0 m.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 3
we discuss the plant design, followed by a description of the
column in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we present the column vacuum
leak tests. In Sect. 6 we discuss the prototype tests and the
validation of some characteristics of the plant with measure-
ments, and in Sect. 7 the projected performance of Aria for
argon isotopic distillation.

3 Plant design

The Aria plant simpliﬁed scheme is displayed in Fig. 1. The
column, cryogenic tanks, and heat exchangers are enclosed
in a cold box (grayed area) which is vacuum-tight and de-
signed to reduce thermal losses. The cryogenic circuit of
the plant is designed with two independent loops: the argon
loop (dark green lines for the liquid and light green lines
for the vapor/gas) and the refrigeration loop, with nitrogen
gas (cyan lines) and liquid (dark blue lines) that are used to
evaporate and to condense the argon. The Aria plant was de-
signed in a way that minimizes nitrogen consumption and
optimizes energy efﬁciency, by using a closed-loop refriger-
ation circuit and appropriate use of heat exchangers.

UAr will be transported from the Urania plant being con-
structed in Cortez, Colorado, USA, to Aria in Sardinia, Italy,

3

and then from Aria to LNGS, Italy, inside gas skids. The
argon gas from the Feed Skid is fed into the distillation
column through a ﬂow controller, and pressure-regulated to
about 1 bar. A heat exchanger (HE4) with the output dis-
tillate stream is used to cool the argon. The bottom stream
comes out of the column as a liquid, gets heated as it passes
through an air heater (H1), compressed (C1) and then deliv-
ered to the Bottom Skid. This is the argon that will be used
in the experiments. At the top of the column, the distillate
stream, enriched in 39Ar, is delivered to the Distillate Stor-
age after passing through HE4 and a compressor (C2).

Liquid nitrogen is used as cooling ﬂuid in the heat ex-
changer (HE1) of the column condenser. The nitrogen vapor
from the output of HE1 is heated through the heat exchanger
HE2 and then compressed, by a screw rotary compressor
(C3), to a pressure value between 2 bar and 4 bar. The com-
pressed gas, after cooling in HE2, is used as heating ﬂuid
in the heat exchanger (HE3) of the reboiler. The liqueﬁed
nitrogen, after passing through a nitrogen phase separator
tank (BT), is pumped by a modular reciprocating pump (P1),
with a delivery pressure up to 100 bar, all the way up to the
top of the column, and fed back to HE1. Liquid nitrogen is
stored and fed into the circuit from an external 50 m3 tank.
The excess nitrogen gas from the system is fed back to the
tank, after being liqueﬁed by four 4 kW cryogenerators (Stir-
ling Cryogenics), inherited from the ICARUS experiment at
LNGS.

Brazed plate heat exchangers are used for the reboiler
(HE3), the condenser (HE1), and HE2. These heat exchang-
ers are characterized by high heat transfer efﬁciency and
limited size and are the ideal solution for this application.
Coil heat exchangers (H1 and HE4) are used for the inlet
and outlet argon ﬂows.

Fig. 1 reports also the values of operating pressure and
temperature, for 39Ar-40Ar distillation, obtained with a plant
engineering simulation using the Aspen HYSYS package. It
can be seen that the column operating temperature varies
from the top to the bottom between 87.8 K and 90.9 K.

4 Column and cold box structure

For construction and transport, both the column and the sur-
rounding cold box have a modular structure. The thirty mod-
ules were assembled at the production site. The 28 central
modules are identical cylindrical elements about 12 m tall,
with a 71.1 cm diameter and an approximate weight of 3 t.
The top module, about 9.5 m tall and 1.2 m diameter, hosts
the top of the distillation column, about 1 m high, the con-
denser (HE1), a liquid nitrogen buffer tank, not shown in the
simpliﬁed scheme of Fig. 1, and two heat recovery exchang-
ers (HE4 and HE2). The bottom module, about 4 m tall and
1.5 m diameter, hosts the bottom of the distillation column,

about 1 m high, the reboiler (HE3), and a nitrogen phase sep-
arator tank (BT). Fig. 2 shows some of the central modules
stored at the Carbosulcis site, ready for installation in the
shaft. Fig. 3 displays the top module while Fig. 4 shows the
bottom module.

The structure of the cold box, the internal equipment,
and the piping are fully welded to reduce the risk of leaks.
All weldings were performed at the manufacturing company
where the modules were assembled, except for the orbital
welds between modules, which will be performed in the mi-
neshaft.

To account for the thermal contraction of the structure,
axial bellows are interleaved between every other module.
At cold, the bellows expands by about 3 cm. Due to the pres-

ence of bellows, the support of each module is independent
from the others. The load is distributed laterally to the shaft
walls. Every module is supplied with anchor points, whose
sizing takes into consideration both the static weight and the
stresses due to the cold box operating pressure. The anchor
points are bolted to a structure, discussed in Sect. 4.3, which
is ﬁxed to the lateral wall of the shaft.

4.1 Internal structure

The 28 central modules are ﬁlled with a structured stain-
less steel packing (Sulzer CY gauze). To stay below the
ﬂooding limit and, therefore, guarantee an efﬁcient distil-
lation with this packing, according to measurements per-

rium, whose value for argon is given in Table 1, is 0.8
Pa.
With this value of F, from the reference curves provided
by the packing producer (Sulzer) and approximating to at-
mospheric pressure, one would expect an HETP of about
10 cm and a pressure drop of 0.7 mbar/m. The measurement
of these parameters in the cryogenic environment is an es-
sential step of this research, and is the main focus of the
tests described in Sect. 6. To avoid the channeling of the
ﬂuid in the packing and to optimize the uniformity across
the column section, each module is divided into four sub-
sections of packing, with an active height of 2.56 m each,
interleaved with a liquid distributor, shown in Fig. 5. The
liquid formed on the distributor plate is streamed, through
holes located at 3 cm height in perforated pipes uniformly
distributed along the plate surface, to the packing section
below. The vapor rises towards the packing section above
through 12.5 cm high chimneys. The total active height of
the column is about 287 m, that corresponds to a N of 2870.
The pressure drop along the column is about 0.7 bar, with
0.5 bar due to the distributors. The minimum argon mass that
needs to be in the column for efﬁcient distillation, is largely
dominated by the liquid component, the vapor contributing
only to 5 % of the total. The two major contributions come
from the distributors, 0.3 m3, and from the wetting of the
packing, the so called holdup, 1.1 m3. The packing wettabil-
ity was assumed for this calculation to be 5 %, as speciﬁed
by the packing vendor. Again, its value was given for the
above mentioned organic mixture and, therefore, will need
to be veriﬁed at the cryogenic temperatures of the column
with argon. The total argon mass in the column during dis-
tillation, with the above mentioned assumptions, turns out to
be approximately 2.5 t.

The thermal load of the column was calculated assuming
the maximum liquid ﬂow speciﬁed by the packing producer,
as discussed in Sect. 4. The required thermal duty for the
cryogenic system turns out about 25 kW, broadly given by
the maximum liquid ﬂow times the heat of vaporisation. The

formed by the vendor with chlorobenzene/etilbenzene mix-
tures, a maximum speciﬁc liquid volume ﬂow rate or load,
ˆVL, of 5 m3/(h m2), is allowed. Given the column inner di-
ameter of 31.8 cm, this corresponds to a liquid volume ﬂow
rate, VL, of 0.4 m3/h or to a mass ﬂow rate of 560 kg/h.

total electric power needed for the plant operation is about
500 kW, including the cryocooler, compressors, ﬂuid, and
vacuum system pumps load.

4.2 Thermal insulation

To minimize heat transfer through conduction and radiation
from the environment to the cryogenic distillation column,
a 10−5 mbar vacuum is made in the cold box. In order to
maintain the desired vacuum level, several pump stations
of total pumping speed 104 L/s, are installed along the col-
umn. In addition, 20 layers of Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI)
are wrapped around the column, and 10 are wrapped around
all the other lines and reservoirs within the col box. With
this insulation, the residual thermal radiation input power to
the column is about 1 W/m2, a few percent of the thermal
duty cycle of the column. Insulation is also provided on the
equipment and piping outside of the cold box, for minimiz-
ing heat losses and for personal protection against the risk of
injuries by accidental contacts. For cold points, the insula-
tion is based on synthetic rubber, covered with aluminum
sheets. Vacuum jacketed pipes are used for long-distance
connections.

4.3 Support structure in the shaft

The support structure of the column is made of austenitic
steel and is assembled by bolted connections. It is made of
discrete structures, shown in Fig. 6, spaced in the vertical
direction by 4 m. To keep a safety margin, three supporting
structures per central module are foreseen, each one able, in
principle, to hold the module independently. The anchoring
shelves penetrate the rock up to an average depth of about
120 cm for the central support, and 80 cm for the other two.
For ﬁlling the 300 mm openings, a cement based thixotropic
mortar is used, with high mechanical strength and compen-
sated shrinkage. Fig. 7 shows the installation of the ﬁrst sup-
port structure in the well. Load tests were performed apply-
ing a 3 t load and no signiﬁcant deﬂection was observed.

5 Vacuum leak tests of individual modules

Leak detection is a critical step in the construction of Aria,
since its functioning depends on a high cold box insulating
vacuum and the distillation process should not be contam-
inated from air. For that reason, by the way, the pressure
of the process column and related lines is kept above the
atmospheric pressure. The leak-check procedure has to be
quite strict, in particular for those lines that will undergo
thermal stresses. Indeed, the column and the service lines

ture, in green, for positioning the column, in magenta. The blue rect-
angle on the right is the elevator.

will go back and forth from room temperature down to liq-
uid argon/nitrogen temperatures several times during their
lifetime.

An upper limit of 10−9 mbar L/s was set on the leak rate
for each leak check performed on single modules during
testing, mainly on welds. Each column segment was tested
twice. The ﬁrst phase of tests took place at the manufactur-
ing company site (Polaris Engineering), where the column
and the service lines were fully tested, before wrapping them
around with MLI. The second phase of the leak checks, car-
ried out at CERN, CH, included also a full check of the cold
box and bellows. For the tests, each module was closed tem-
porarily with end-caps, the space between the cold box and
the distillation column was evacuated with a turbopump sys-
tem, and the column and the service lines were ﬁlled with a
mixture of 90% of air and 10% of helium. In this way, the
potential leak can be found by the leak detector associated
with the turbopump system. All the modules were validated
in a two-step approach to conﬁrm a leak rate smaller than
10−9 mbar L/s on each module. Since there are 30 column
segments in total, the total leak rate is expected to be smaller
than 3 × 10−7 mbar L/s at room temperature. An additional

one-off leak test was performed at CERN to validate mod-
ule tightness after a thermal cycle down to 87 K. The reboiler
unit was chosen for this test, due to its complex internal weld
conﬁguration, and tightness below 10−9 mbar L/s was again
conﬁrmed.

6 Performance test at total reﬂux with a prototype
column.

To verify the theoretical calculations about the distillation
performance, and test the mechanical and cryogenic infras-
tructure prior to column installation in the mineshaft, a pro-
totype plant was built in a surface building.

6.1 Prototype construction

The prototype plant is a short version of the Aria column
using only the reboiler, the condenser and one central mod-
ule, for a total height of 26 m, together with the auxiliary
equipment, which is the same as that of the full column. It
is located in the Laveria building of the Carbosulcis mine,
Nuraxi-Figus site, as shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. The me-

sulcis mine, Nuraxi-Figus site, viewed from the basis of the column.

chanical support, made of galvanized and cold-painted car-
bon steel, consists of a square base structure with four feet
of concrete and a modular iron pillar structure equipped on
each side with two diagonal support beams. The structure
includes seven level platforms, to allow the presence of op-
erators along the column height. Though self-supporting, for
additional safety, the support is ﬁxed to the building struc-
ture at two different heights.

After welding together the three modules, the column
and the four service lines were leak checked with a cali-
brated leak detector. An external calibration leak was used
to estimate the helium diffusion time along all the lines. This
turned out to be between four and twenty seconds, depend-
ing on the line. Therefore it was decided to wait at least two
minutes between every leak check to make sure that a possi-

building of the Carbosulcis mine, Nuraxi-Figus site. From bottom left,

ble signal could be associated with the precise tested weld.
The standard technique of ﬁlling sealed bags with helium
around the welds was used for all the procedure. The he-
lium bags, once ﬁlled with helium, were not removed un-
til the last leak check. Using this method an upper limit of
10−9 mbar L/s was set on all the welds between the mod-
ules.

Leak detection will become increasingly more difﬁcult
during the assembly of the modules in the shaft. With the
leak test procedure just described, the increased size of the
column, as the modules are assembled together, will cause
a much longer response time of the leak detection system,
reducing its sensitivity. To overcome this difﬁculty, the use
of some new tools is foreseen. Devices called clamshells,
developed at CERN, will surround the welds and create a
small sealed space that can be quickly evacuated. Helium
will ﬂow inside the tube/column, and the potential leak in
the weld can be therefore detected with a very fast response
time.

6.2 Prototype Operation

For the commissioning of the prototype plant, different pu-
rity grades of N2 were used both in the auxiliary circuit for
cooling, and in the process circuit for the distillation inside
the column. The operating parameters of the auxiliary sys-
tem were about the same as those discussed in Sect. 3.

A dedicated slow-control system monitors and controls
the distillation process and ll equipment in real time. This
system uses LabVIEW (NI) as system-design platform and
development environment, and it is organized with a dis-
tributed layered architecture. The control cabinets are inter-
connected by a private WLAN network, inside the Carbo-
Sulcis network, with a Real Time Controller (NI cRIO 9039)
reading out the data of the different expansion chassis (NI
9049) distributed over the network. In addition, PROFIBUS,
a standard for ﬁeldbus communication in automation tech-
nology, is integrated into the system to control third party
equipment such as compressors, vacuum gauges and vac-
uum pumps. The slow control also features advanced con-
trols such as Proportional Integral Derivative control, cas-
cade control, threshold logic, interlocks over valves, invert-
ers, and temperature controllers. Historical data are stored in
a relational data base (PostgreSQL).

Plant operation started with feeding the cooling liquid
nitrogen to the auxiliary circuit from the external storage
tank and nitrogen of purity grade 5 into the column. Eight
hours were needed to reach the target temperature. The total
amount of nitrogen ﬁlling the column was estimated by tak-
ing into account that it was stored in 16 gas bottles of 50 L
each, with an initial pressure of 200 bar and a ﬁnal pressure
of 80 bar. Using the Peng-Robinson equation of state, the
total mass is then 110 kg.

The measurements reported in this paper refer to two
distillation runs of the plant, 165 h in total, with two differ-
ent screw-rotary compressor (C3) settings, with the column
operated at total reﬂux. The two runs started and stopped
with switching on and off the compressor and, with some
delay, the pumps. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show the measured
pressure vs. time and mass ﬂow vs. time in the auxiliary
system, downstream of the compressor. For these ﬁrst two
runs, an automated feedback system, foreseen in the plant
design, regulating the ﬂow downstream of the compressor,
was not used. The auxiliary system gas pressure and ﬂow
stability were guaranteed only regulating by hand a bypass
valve between the compressor and the gas ﬂow meter. A bet-
ter stability was reached during the second run, where ﬂuc-
tuations were limited to ±0.3 bar and ±20 m3/h, as shown
in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, respectively. The pressure inside the
column was measured by digital pressure transmitters with
diaphragm seal measuring cell, located respectively below
the ﬁrst distributor from the top and right above the reboiler.

the top vs. time. The different pressure in the column com-
pared to what is expected for argon, as discussed in Sect. 3,
comes from the different thermodynamic properties of the
nitrogen and the operating temperature gradients of the heat
exchangers of the reboiler and of the condenser of about 5 K.
Since nitrogen was used both for cooling and as distillation
ﬂuid, the mass ﬂow rate in the cooling circuit was the same
as that inside the column. From Fig. 11 it can be deduced,
then, that the mass ﬂowrates during this test ranged between
the maximum allowed ﬂow in the column by the packing
producer, as discussed in Sect. 4, and half of it. The pressure
drop along the prototype column during the second run was
of the order of 12 mbar, as shown in Fig. 13. Therefore, for
the following calculations, it is possible to assume that both
pressure and temperature are constant along the column. The
nitrogen temperature inside the column was derived from
the pressure measurement using the Antoine equation [15].
From the data of Fig. 12 it follows that, during the second
run, the temperature ranged from 83 K to 87 K. The mea-

sured vacuum level in the cold box during the two runs was
stable around 3 × 10−6 mbar.

6.3 Expected values for nitrogen distillation

The nitrogen molecule, N2, is mainly formed by two sta-
ble isotopes, 14N and 15N, leading to an isotopic fraction
of 99.3 % for the 28N2 and 0.7 % for the 29N2, and, there-
fore, to an isotopic ratio, RN2, between the two molecules, of
7.4 × 10−3. The relative volatility between 29N2 and 28N2,
α28−29, is given, according to [7], by ln α28−29 = 0.846/T -
6.9 × 10−3, where T is the temperature in Kelvin, implying
α28−29=1.003, at the mean column operating temperature of
85 K. This value of the relative volatility is large enough to
give a sizeable separation, at total reﬂux, even with the pro-
totype column that nominally has only about 100 theoretical
stages, namely of S0

28−29=1.35.

6.4 Distillation measurements

A quadrupole mass spectrometer (Extrel MAX-300) mea-
sured the ﬂuid composition, sampling in the reboiler, in the
condenser, and in the feed line at the output of the gas bot-
tles, using up to 18 m long and 0.18 mm diameter copper
capillaries. With this mass spectrometer, the peaks corre-
sponding to 28N2 and 29N2 are well separated, and, there-
fore, isotopic ratio measurements were directly taken from
the peak height ratio. In Fig. 14 the measured isotopic ra-
tios RN2 vs. time from the reboiler, condenser and feed are
shown. When the plant started operation, the three isotopic
ratios were the same. With time, they started to diverge, as
expected with the distillation taking place, and, after some
time, they reached a plateau value. It should be noticed that
at the end of the ﬁrst run, the isotopic ratio in the reboiler
dropped almost to the feed value while the one of the con-
denser increased only after about 10 h. This is due to the fact
that when the compressor and the pumps are switched off,
i.e. the distillation process is stopped, the liquid present in
the columns sinks quickly in the reboiler under gravity, and
mixes with that already present there, whereas this is not the
case for the vapor. From Fig. 14 it can also be noticed that
the isotopic ratio of the feed gas is not exactly equal to the
natural isotopic ratio value discussed in Sect. 6.3 and this
is due to the mass spectrometer not fully calibrated before
use. Also the isotopic ratio values slightly drifted over time,
probably due to some internal component of the spectrome-
ter becoming dirty. Anyhow, the separation, S0
28−29, deﬁned
as RN2(condenser)/RN2(reboiler), depending only on the ra-
tio of the two RN2, it is not affected by this drift to ﬁrst order.
Fig. 15 shows the separation, S0

28−29, vs time.

6.5 Measurement interpretation

From the measured separation S0
28−29 and the calculated re-
lationship between α28−29 and temperature, as discussed in
Sect. 6.3, it is possible to derive the effective number of the-
oretical stages and, knowing the packing height per mod-
ule of 10.24 m, as discussed in Sect. 4, the HETP vs. time,
as shown in Fig. 16. The best value obtained during the
two runs is about 11.5 cm. This value of HETP is in broad
agreement with the assumed value for argon of Sect. 7. This
agreement represents a validation of the concept of cryo-
genic distillation with this plant. However, it should be un-
derlined that the tests described here were performed, in
terms of pressure inside the column, outside of the range for
which the vendor provides comparison data, and at a value
of the sizing parameter F of 0.3
Pa, which is different from
that calculated for argon in Sect. 4. The observed transient,
i.e. the time needed to reach plateau operation in Fig. 15,
turns out to be about 16 h. It is important to point out that
the time to reach the steady state is strongly dependent on

required before extrapolating this value to the Aria column
performance with argon.

7 Projected performance of Aria with argon, at ﬁnite
reﬂux

The McCabe-Thiele method [16] was used to calculate the
performance of argon distillation in Aria with ﬁnite reﬂux.
This method was already applied to cryogenic distillation
by collaborations using xenon as active target for dark mat-
ter search [8, 10, 11], but it is fair to say that it was never
validated with argon. The input parameters of the calcula-
tion are summarized in Table 1 and it was also assumed the
feed to be a saturated vapor. The relative volatility, α39−40,
is assumed constant along the column height and equal to
the value corresponding to the mean operating temperature
of the column. The calculation was performed for individ-
ual values of B/F, where B and F are the mass ﬂow rates in
the bottom and feed streams, respectively. Fig. 17 shows B
vs. B/F. We consider as benchmark value B/F to be 50 %, a
reasonable assumption given the UAr is a valuable material.

mark value is shown in Fig. 18. The output parameters of
the calculation are shown in Table 2. The calculation also
yields the location of the feed point in the column, which
turns out to be at the top of the seventh module, i.e. at about
20% height from the top of the column. This is where the
feed connections are located. The obtained value of S39−40,
the separation of eq. (2) calculated at ﬁnite reﬂux, can be
compared with that obtained at total reﬂux, S0
39−40, which is
57. If xB were required to be 3 × 10−20, then B would be-
come 2.5 kg/d, with the same feed point.

The dominant systematic uncertainties in this calcula-
tion come from the uncertainty on the mean α39−40 value
and on the number of theoretical stages, N. As discussed
in Sect. 2, α39−40 was calculated from the measured value
of α36−40. Another publication [17] reports a lower value
of α36−40 than that reported in Sect. 2, that would lead to
α39−40=1.0013 at the mean operating temperature of the col-
umn of 89.5 K. At this value one would have a decrease in B
by about 25%. A 10% variation on N leads instead to a 30%
change in B. Were the measurements of HETP reported in
Sect. 6 conﬁrmed in a run with argon, a decrease in B of this
magnitude, compared to that of Table 2, could be expected.
Eventually, all the output rates are proportional to ˆVL, i.e.
halving this value leads to halving B. The effect of varying
α39−40 along the column height according to the tempera-
ture proﬁle, was estimated modifying the standard McCabe-
Thiele calculation, with the equilibrium curve assumed to
be varying stage by stage. A marginal difference in the ﬁnal
result was obtained.

A major assumption in the above calculation is the bi-
nary distillation hypothesis, i.e. that isotopes present in the
gas other than 39Ar and 40Ar do not inﬂuence the calcula-
tion. It is well known that 36Ar and 38Ar have sizeable iso-
topic fractions in AAr, of 0.33% and 0.06%, respectively,
though it has been reported that their isotopic fraction is
about forty times lower in UAr [18]. However, the assump-
tion of a binary mixture is considered to be reasonable, for
two main reasons. On one hand, the two additional isotopes
are mostly recovered in the distillate stream, because their
relative volatility to 40Ar is larger than one, and therefore
we expect no signiﬁcant difference in the composition of
the bottom stream. On the other hand, the isotopic fraction
of both the distillate and the bottom ﬂow of 36Ar and 38Ar

Therefore, the thermodynamic properties of the isotope mix-
ture are marginally changed during the distillation process,
and so does α39−40.

Moreover, the presence of 36Ar with a signiﬁcant iso-
topic fraction can be very useful for the plant commissioning
e.g. with atmospheric argon, by measuring isotopic fractions
along the column with a mass spectrometer. At total reﬂux,
the separation factor S36−40 is 2.8 × 106. At ﬁnite reﬂux, a
calculation with the McCabe-Thiele method with the same
parameters as above, requiring a reduction factor of 1000,
gives the results of Table 3.

Another factor that has to be taken into account, when
calculating the plant performance in terms of 39Ar suppres-
sion, is the cosmogenic activation of the argon. Cosmogenic
activation occurs at the extraction site in Colorado, during
transportation, and at the Aria site, during the operation of
the plant, since the argon to be processed is stored on the
surface. Preliminary studies indicate that the dominant com-
ponent of the activation comes from cosmic ray neutrons
during storage at the Aria site, and is of the order of 15 % of

120 d long run to obtain 1 t of argon with a reduced isotopic
fraction of 10.

The 39Ar isotopic fraction is so low that it cannot be
detected with a mass spectrometer. Therefore, to verify the
performance of Aria in terms of isotopic distillation, a new
experiment, DArT in ArDM [19], based on a radioactivity
measurement, was recently designed and approved at the
Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC), Spain. The ex-
periment is expected to set an upper limit on the DF, at 90%
C.L., of 6 × 10−4. Therefore, it is expected to measure the
residual 39Ar content after distillation in the commissioning
phase of the Aria plant with atmospheric argon with good
precision.

The design, construction, prototype tests, and performance
simulations of the Aria cryogenic distillation column that is
currently in the installation phase at Carbosulcis S.p.A., in
Nuraxi-Figus (SU), Italy were discussed in detail. The mea-
surement with the prototype of a HETP in broad agreement
with the expectations, validated the concept of the cryogenic
distillation with this plant. The successful run of the Aria
plant is expected to have a tremendous impact in the ﬁeld of
isotopic separation, with applications ranging from nuclear
physics to medicine and beyond.
