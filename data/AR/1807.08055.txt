Abstract 

We have studied the  growth  of  metastable face-centered-cubic,  non-magnetic Fe78Ni22 thin films  on 

silicon substrates. These films undergo a magnetic (paramagnetic to ferromagnetic) and structural (fcc 

to  bcc)  phase  transformation  upon  ion  beam  irradiation  and  thus  can  serve  as  a  template  for  direct 

writing of magnetic nanostructures by the focused ion beam. So far, these films were prepared only on 

single crystal Cu(100) substrates. We show that transformable Fe78Ni22 thin films can also be prepared 

on a hydrogen-terminated Si(100) with a 130-nm-thick Cu(100) buffer layer. The H-Si(100) substrates 

can  be  prepared  by  hydrofluoric  acid  etching  or  by  annealing  at  1200°C  followed  by  adsorption  of 

atomic  hydrogen.  The  Cu(100) buffer layer and  Fe78Ni22 fcc  metastable thin  film  were  deposited  by 

thermal  evaporation in an  ultra-high  vacuum.  The films  were consequently  transformed  in-situ by 4 

keV Ar+ ion irradiation and ex-situ by a 30 keV Ga+ focused ion beam, and their magnetic properties 

were studied by magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry. The substitution of expensive copper single 

crystal substrate by standard silicon wafers dramatically expands application possibilities of metastable 

paramagnetic thin films for focused ion beam direct magnetic patterning.

1.  Introduction 

Magnetic  nanopatterning  plays a central role in  the  development  of  novel  devices and  magnetic 

metamaterials with properties unattainable in bulk systems. The patterning is conventionally achieved 

by  using  optical  or  electron-beam  lithography  in  combination  with  lift-off  and  etching  procedures. 

However,  these  methods  do  not  allow,  for  example,  for  continuous  spatial  changes  in  magnetic 

properties.  The  resulting  structures  usually  have  sharp  magnetic-nonmagnetic  transitions  leading  to, 

e.g.,  highly  localized  demagnetizing  fields,  or  stochastic  distribution  of  pinning  sites  that  cannot  be 

 
 
 
 
controlled  merely  by  the  fabrication  process  itself.  An  alternative  to  the  traditional  lithography  is  a 

fabrication of magnetic elements by ion beam [1]. The ion beam can modify the magnetic properties of 

a material by alloying [2], intermixing [3] or by a structural change [4]. We have shown that it is possible 

to  embed  ferromagnetic  body-centered-cubic  (bcc)  nanostructures  in  epitaxial  paramagnetic  face-

centered-cubic (fcc) films with a 1 keV Ar+ ion beam [4, 5]. The system used in these works was an fcc 

Fe grown on a Cu(100) substrate [6, 7]. The ion-beam induces a structural and magnetic phase change 

by overcoming the potential barrier between the fcc local minimum and the bcc global minimum and 

we, therefore, call these fcc films metastable. The metastable Fe/Cu(100) spontaneously transforms to 

bcc phase at 10 ML [8], but this limit can be shifted to 22 ML by dosing CO [9] and even further by 

alloying Fe with 22% of Ni [10]. We have shown that it is possible to fabricate magnetic nanostructures 

in these films by ion-beam irradiation using proximity masks [5] or focused ion beams (FIB) and that 

by suitably chosen FIB patterning procedures it is possible to tune saturation magnetization and also 

the magnetic anisotropy of the transformed structures [11]. 

Metastable  Fe78Ni22/Cu(100)  is  an  excellent  system  for  a  one-step  fabrication  of  magnetic 

nanostructures, but the  copper single  crystal is an  expensive substrate  for  use in  future applications. 

Here we show, that it is possible to use also standard Si(100) wafers as a base substrate for this system. 

Silicon has been the most commonly used material in the semiconductor industry and scientific research 

for  decades,  not  only  for  its  electronic  properties  but  also  because  of  the  well-known  processes  for 

preparation  of  very  well  defined  substrates  with  almost  perfect  crystallographic  properties.  Our 

experiments  indicate  that  the  Fe  does  not  grow  epitaxially  on  Si(100),  but  it  is  possible  to  grow  a 

Cu(100) buffer layer on Si(100) [12-14]. The Cu buffer layer grows in the desired (100) crystallographic 

orientation  when the  Si(100) surface is  unreconstructed,  hydrogen-terminated (H-Si),  which is  most 

commonly  achieved  by  etching  in  hydrofluoric  acid  (HF)  [12-17].  The  lattice  constants  of  Cu  and 

unreconstructed Si lead to a significant (33.5%) lattice mismatch; however, rotation by 45° decreases 

the lattice mismatch to 6%.   

Additionally to the known HF etching procedure, we have also used an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) 

alternative, which requires annealing of Si at 1200°C followed by adsorption of atomic hydrogen. The 

growth of the 130 nm thick Cu(100) buffer layer on H-Si substrates prepared by both procedures was 

tested together with the subsequent deposition of the metastable fcc Fe78Ni22 films. The transformation 

to the bcc phase  was performed both, in-situ by a weakly focused ion beam and ex-situ by the FIB. 

Measurement of the magnetic properties of the transformed thin films and nanostructures performed by 

Kerr magnetometry show that Fe78Ni22/Cu(100)/H-Si(100) is a viable alternative to systems prepared 

on Cu(100) single-crystal substrates. 

2.  Experimental 

The UHV system used for the experiments has a base pressure of 7×10-11 mbar (measured by a 

Bayard-Alpert  ionization  gauge)  and  is  equipped  with  a  three-pocket  e-beam  evaporator  (Focus 

EFM3T), a single pocket e-beam evaporator (Focus EFM3) and a Knudsen effusion cell (CreaTec). The 

samples can be cooled by liquid nitrogen to 100 K and heated by e-beam bombardment of the sample 

holder plate to 1000 K. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) was used to check the cleanliness of the 

substrates and the composition of grown films. The AES spectra have been normalized to the minimum 

of  the  average  peak-to-peak  height  of  the  dominant  peak.  Presented  concentrations  correspond  to 

quantitative analysis using relative elemental sensitivity factors [18]. The structure of the surfaces was 

measured by Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED). The LEED images were post-processed with a 

dark-field subtraction, flat-field normalization [19] and inverted.  

The experiments were performed on B-doped (p-type) Si with a resistivity of  5-20 Ωcm. The 

dimensions  of  the  samples  were  3×12×0.4  mm3.  Two  procedures  were  applied  to  obtaining  a  H-

terminated surface.  The chemically treated Si  was  etched  for 2.5  minutes in 10% HF  to remove the 

native oxide and to terminate the Si with hydrogen [17], then rinsed for 1 minute in high-purity (Merck 

Milli-Q) water, dried with argon gas and transferred into a  loadlock connected to the UHV chamber 

within 10 minutes after etching. The H-terminated Si should be inert to the ambient atmosphere for such 

a period [17]. Then, the sample was outgassed in the UHV chamber at 100°C for 30 minutes. After this 

procedure, the sample cleanliness was checked by AES and the surface reconstruction by LEED. 

In the UHV procedure, Si samples were heated by direct current (DC) heating in a home-built 

heating stage. Target holders were made of Mo; their design was based on the Omicron sample plates 

for DC heating. After introducing the samples into UHV, we outgassed the sample holder by heating it 

 
to 600 °C for approx. 20h. We then heated the samples by DC to 600 °C for approx. 20 h until the base 

pressure in the chamber was restored. After the outgassing phase, we annealed the samples repeatedly 

at 1200 °C by DC for 5 seconds with a 5-second ramp from the outgassing temperature. The highest 

pressure during the last annealing step was kept below 5×10-10 mbar. With this approach, we were able 

to completely remove both the native oxide and also any organic impurities. The H termination was 

achieved by a home-built H-cracker based on the design of Bischler [20]. A tungsten capillary with a 

0.6 mm  inner  diameter  was  heated  by  1  keV  e-beam  bombardment  to  approx.  1800 °C,  which 

completely dissociated the H2 flowing through it [21]. The end of the capillary was approx. 3 cm from 

the  sample  and  a  liquid-N2-cooled  Cu  plate  between  the  W  tube  and  the  sample  limited  the  sample 

heating  to  approx.  1 °C/min.  The  sample  was  exposed  to  atomic  hydrogen  (1×10-6 mbar H2 

backpressure)  for  7 mins  to  achieve  a  complete  H  termination.  Again,  the  sample  cleanliness  was 

checked by AES and the surface reconstruction by LEED. 

Cu  was  evaporated  from  two  sources,  the  EFM3,  and  the  effusion  cell.  The  material  of  the 

effusion cell crucible contained a small amount of Ca contamination (confirmed by Secondary Ion Mass 

Spectrometry) which was detectable also in the deposited layer and which turned out to be an essential 

surfactant needed to stabilize the growth of the Cu buffer layer in the required (100) orientation on UHV 

treated  samples.  The  temperature  of  the  sample  increased  by  10 °C  via  radiation  heating  during  the 

deposition from the effusion cell. The pressure during the deposition was 1×10−10 mbar (with the help 

of a liquid-N2-cooled cryo baffle and a titanium sublimation pump). Deposition rates were calibrated 

with a quartz crystal microbalance at the position of the substrate, and the deposition was done at room 

temperature (RT) unless mentioned otherwise. The deposition rate of both Cu evaporators was 0.06 Ås-

1 (approx. 5.8 h for 130 nm). The Fe78Ni22 layers were evaporated by the EFM3T from a rod with a 2 

mm diameter (MaTecK).  A repelling voltage of +1.5 kV was applied to a cylindrical electrode (flux 

monitor) in the orifice of the evaporator to suppress high-energy ions, which may modify the growth 

mode of the films [22]. The base pressure during the deposition was 8×10−11 mbar, which was artificially 

increased to 5×10−10 mbar of CO to stabilize the fcc phase in line with previous observations [10]. The 

deposition rate of Fe78Ni22 was 0.02 Ås-1 (approx. 1h for 8 nm). After each deposition step, the surface 

composition and the crystallographic structure were measured by AES and by LEED (respectively). 

Large-Area  irradiation  of  one  set  of  samples  was  performed  in-situ  by  an  ion  gun  (Specs) 

equipped with a Wien filter by scanning the sample with a time-averaged ion flux of approx. 1013 cm-

2s-1. To maximize the transformation rate, we used 4 keV Ar+ ions, which penetrate the whole Fe78Ni22 

layer at perpendicular incidence and do not cause significant Fe-Cu intermixing [23]. During the ion 

beam  irradiation,  we  periodically  measured  magnetic  hysteresis  loops  by  a  home-built  Surface 

Magneto-Optical  Kerr  Effect  (SMOKE)  apparatus.  The  SMOKE  experiment  can  be  performed  in 

longitudinal or polar geometry (angle of incidence 60° or 30°, respectively, with a spot size of approx. 

1 mm). The plane of incidence and the direction of the magnetic field were parallel to the (010) plane 

of the Si substrate.  

To  study  the  potential  of  the  metastable  films  for  magnetic  micro-  and  nanopatterning,  we 

performed a local ion-beam-induced transformation in a high vacuum (approx. 10-7 mbar) chamber of 

a focused ion beam – scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) system (Tescan LYRA3). A series of 

3×3 μm2 squares was irradiated with the Ga

+

 FIB at 30 keV with a spot size of 20 nm and a beam current 

of 40 pA with an increasing ion dose. We varied the irradiation dose between individual areas and then 

measured the patterns by SEM, Kerr microscopy and micro-focused Kerr magnetometry [24].  

3.  Results and discussion 

a.  Surface structure and stoichiometry 

The  chemically  prepared  Si(100)  samples  had  a  (1×1)  diffraction  pattern  after  introduction  into  the 

UHV and mild annealing, which is shown by a green square in Figure 1a). The unetched, UHV treated 

Si(100) showed (2×1)-reconstructed domains after annealing to 1200 °C [blue rectangles in Figure 1d)] 

which changed into a (1×1) after termination with atomic H [green square in Figure 1e)]. The change 

in reconstruction confirms that the atomic H had saturated all the Si dangling bonds [25, 26]. The (1×1)  

diffraction  pattern,  therefore,  means  that  both  approaches  are  potentially  suitable  for  the  growth  of 

epitaxial Cu(100).

The AES measurement shows that the HF-etched surface after mild annealing (100 °C) has 15% of C 

and 2% of O [blue line in Figure 2a),c)]. Because etching in HF for 2.5 minutes completely removes 

the SiO2, we contribute this signal to imperfect H termination of Si and contamination during transport 

from the ambient atmosphere before introducing the sample into the UHV, which was impossible to 

desorb during the mild annealing. Multiple steps of cleaning before the last HF-etch can minimize this 

contamination  [17,  27].  The  excessive  contamination  of  the  etched  Si  can  prevent  the  growth  of  an 

epitaxial Cu(100) buffer layer; Cu then grows in (111) orientation [28]. H-Si prepared in UHV is much 

cleaner than the chemically treated Si [compare orange and blue lines in Figure 2a),c)]. The outgassed 

Si with a native SiO2 is still slightly contaminated by C (black lines in Figure 2), and after annealing, 

we observe a complete removal of the native oxide and carbon contamination (compare black and red 

lines in Figure 2). The H termination does not introduce any impurities (orange lines in Figure 2).

We deposited Cu  on both H-Si(100) substrates  prepared chemically and in UHV. We  grew 130-nm 

thick films because at this thickness we found a right balance between the film morphology [13] and 

the deposition time, which was with our evaporators below 6 hours. The deposition of Cu resulted in 

LEED patterns which confirm that the as-grown Cu film on the chemically treated substrate was very 

similar to the one on the H-Si prepared in UHV [Figure 1b),f)]. Both films showed a 45° rotation of 

their unit cell with respect to the underlying substrate and a unit cell reduced by a factor of √2 [marked 

by  orange and  green squares in  Figures 1b),f)]. The  fcc  (100) diffraction spots are  diffused, and  we 

could  also  observe  their  splitting.  Both  the  diffusion  and  splitting  of  the  diffraction  spots  lead  to  a

conclusion that the Cu grows as epitaxial islands with terraces wide only a few nm, as already shown 

by Mewes et al. [14]. Deposition assisted with ion bombardment from the sputter gun did not bring any 

significant  difference  in  the  as-grown  films.  Deposition  at  lower  or  higher  temperatures  (-20 °C,  > 

50 °C) led to a growth of a polycrystalline fcc (111) film, in line with previous observations  [29, 30]. 

Post-annealing did not lead to flattening of the film; in fact, we could observe a signal from Si in AES 

while heating to 150 °C for two hours, in contrast to Lukaszew et al. [31]. The Si signal in AES after 

post-anneal showed a splitting in energy, which corresponds to the formation of bulk copper silicides, 

i.e., hybridization between the Si 3p states and the Cu 3d states [16]. 

The 130-nm Cu buffer layer on the chemically prepared H-Si was completely clean according 

to AES [violet lines in Figure 2a),d)], indicating that the impurities have either desorbed or got buried 

by Cu deposition. We were not able to deposit an fcc (100) Cu buffer layer on the UHV prepared H-Si 

by  depositing  pure  Cu,  but  we  were  successful  when  we  used  a  Ca-containing  Mo  crucible  in  the 

effusion cell. The surface of the 100 nm Cu films deposited from the Ca-containing Mo crucible had 

2% of Ca. This is not necessarily concentration in the films; Ca is virtually insoluble in Cu [32], so it is 

likely that Ca floats to the top during growth and only a negligible part is incorporated. Ca has an fcc 

structure and a 2.8% lattice mismatch to Si(100) and in this case, it most probably served as a surfactant 

supporting  the  epitaxial  growth.  After  deposition  of  100  nm  fcc  (100)  Cu  [magenta  lines  in  Figure 

2a),d)],  we  have  continued  with  deposition  of  30  nm  of  pure  Cu,  and  AES  measurements  after  the 

deposition [identical with the  violet lines in Figure 2a),d)] revealed that the completed film does not 

have any Ca on the surface. 

In the  last step  of the  film  preparation, we  deposited 8  nm  of  Fe78Ni22(100) on  the  epitaxial 

Cu(100) buffer layer grown on both substrates. Diffraction spots in Figure 1c),g) are commensurate, 

not split and similarly diffuse as the ones on the Cu buffer layer [Figure 1b),f)]. The spot shape indicates 

that the Fe78Ni22 and the buffer layers beneath have similar morphology and that the structure  of the 

metastable  film  is  also  fcc  (100).  As  the  films  were  deposited  with  a  CO  background  pressure,  the 

surface of the metastable films had 8% C and 5% O measured by AES, as shown by the green line in 

Figure 2a) and by the detail of the C-peak in Figure 2d). The C and O peaks arise from the dissociation 

of the CO in which the films are deposited, as described elsewhere [9]. The combination of LEED and 

AES demonstrates that it is possible to grow epitaxial films of Fe78Ni22(100) on both H-Si(100) prepared 

by wet chemistry or in UHV. 

b.  In-situ magnetic transformation by broad beam irradiation 

The  experiments  presented  in  Figures  3  and  4  were  performed  on  samples  prepared  by  the  UHV 

treatment; the samples treated by wet chemistry showed equivalent results. SMOKE measurements of 

the as-deposited films [black circles in Figure 3a)] show a non-zero magnetic signal suggesting a small 

fraction of the film is already in the bcc ferromagnetic (FM) phase. Irradiation with a dose of 2×1015 cm-

2 leads to partial magnetic transformation; the hysteresis loop [green line in Figure 3 a)] exhibits high 

coercivity  and  the  Kerr  signal  reaches  approx.  50%  of  the  maximum  value  measured  for  the  fully 

transformed film. The film is completely transformed upon applying a transformation dose of  6×1015 

cm-2 [red rectangles in Figure 3a)].

deposited film is weakly FM (black). The film partially transforms to bcc (green) after irradiation with dose of

We demonstrate the development of the magnetic transformation with an increasing ion dose 

by the magenta line in Figure 3b). We do not detect any measurable signal up to the ion dose of 2×1014 

cm-2. The  magnetic signal then increases with the increasing ion dose up to the  dose of 6×1015 cm-2, 

where  it  reaches  a  maximum  and  then  decreases  as  the  magnetic  thin  film  is  sputtered  away  and 

intermixes with the Cu layer below. The ion dose at which we reach the maximum transformation is 

equal to the transformation dose for films grown on a Cu(100) single crystal [10]. The Kerr ellipticity 

of  the  transformed  film  is  10%  lower  than  in  the  case  of  the  films  deposited  on  a  Cu(100)  single 

crystal[10], which we attribute to the corrugation of the metastable film arising from the underlying Cu 

buffer layer.  

The coercivity [blue line in Figure 3b)] starts increasing at the same ion dose as the magnetic 

saturation (around 2×1014 cm-2) to reach a maximum at 2×1015 cm-2. It then falls rapidly to its minimum, 

which matches the maximum of the magnetic saturation at 6×1015 cm-2. From observations on Cu(100) 

single crystal substrate we know that increasing the ion dose increases the number and size of bcc nuclei 

randomly  dispersed  in  the  fcc  layer.  The  maximum  in  the  coercive  field  corresponds  to  the  nuclei 

reaching the maximum size for single magnetic domains. This property is well known from magnetic 

nanoparticle studies [33]. Further lowering of the coercive field is attributed to multi-domain states of 

magnetic particles and more efficient interaction in between the nanoparticles through the stray field of 

individual particles.

 Focused ion beam magnetic patterning 

Figure 4 shows the results of patterning the metastable films with the FIB. The grey level in SEM (inset 

at  the  bottom  of  Figure  4)  allows  for  distinguishing  the  as-deposited  (grey)  areas  and  the  irradiated 

(darker or brighter) areas and serves as a valuable pre-characterization tool. The irradiated areas become 

darker at a dose of 5×1013 cm-2 but brighten again at doses above 1016 cm-2. The reason for the decrease 

of the SEM signal is the fcc → bcc structural change, which affects electron channeling and associated 

secondary electron emission [11]. The last square then shows the signal from the Cu buffer layer after 

a complete removal of the Fe78Ni22 film. 

 
 
Figure 4: SEM and Kerr magnetometry analysis of 3×3 μm2 squares in the 8-nm Fe78Ni22/130 nm Cu/Si(100) 

irradiated by a 30 keV Ga+ FIB for different ion doses. The Kerr magnetometry confirms that there is no 

magnetic signal in films irradiated with dose below 5×1013 cm-2 (inset top - black line).  The film has largest 

magnetic saturation (MS) when irradiated by 3×1015 cm-2 (inset top - red line). The surrounding fcc does not 

show any hysteresis. The inset at the bottom shows SEM images of the irradiated squares for the ion doses at 

the abscissa (with a half-an-order step starting at 1×1013 cm-2). 

The data from Kerr magnetometry (Figure 4) show the onset of the magnetic transformation at 

an ion dose of 1×1014 cm-2. The maximum of the magnetization is achieved at ion doses 1×1015 cm-2–

3×1015 cm-2.  The  transformation  by  30 keV  Ga+  ions  qualitatively  shows  the  same  behavior  as  the 

transformation performed in-situ [see Figure 3b)], but the ion dose needed to achieve full transformation 

is lower for the Ga+. We attribute this difference to the higher cross section for creation of recoils with 

high enough energy to induce the thermal spike [4]. For example, according to SRIM [23], Ga+ create 

4 times more 1 keV recoils than Ar+ as they travel through the metastable film.  

The inset in Figure 4 shows the hysteresis loops of the squares irradiated by low ion dose (black 

line) and at the maximum magnetization (red line). The squares irradiated by low ion dose do not show 

any FM signal,  which  is in contrast  with the  measurement by SMOKE in  Figure 3 (black line). We 

assume this is because the SMOKE collects signal from a large area, and the small fraction of the film 

which is already in the bcc ferromagnetic (FM) phase is not recognizable by the Kerr magnetometer.

Conclusion 

We have shown that it is possible to grow metastable, epitaxial fcc Fe78Ni22 on H-Si(100) with a 

Cu(100)  buffer  layer,  and  that  using  a  focused  ion  beam,  we  can  create  magnetic  micro-  and 

nanostructures with tuneable magnetization. The lower size limit of such nanostructures is given by the 

focus  of  the  ion  beam  and  the  size  of  the  bcc  nuclei  [5].  The  magnetic  properties  of  the  films  are 

comparable to the properties of Fe78Ni22 films prepared on Cu(100) single crystal substrates [11]. We 

have presented two (UHV and chemical) possibilities for the preparation of the H-Si(100) substrate of 

which the UHV alternative has not been used in the past. We have stabilized the Cu(100) buffer layer 

on  the  UHV  prepared  H-Si(100)  by  addition  of  Ca.  Future  research  should  focus  on  creating  a  flat 

Cu(100) buffer layer by, e.g., introducing a wetting layer. Also, the role of Ca in the stabilization of the 

epitaxial growth of Cu(100) warrants further investigations.  

Metastable  films  for  ion-beam-induced  magnetic  transformation  present  a  promising  system  for 

fabrication of magnetic metamaterials, such as magnonic crystals. They are an alternative to standard 

lithography approaches, and the possibility to use a standard substrate such as Si(100) is undoubtedly 

an essential step towards applications in rapid prototyping of magnetic metamaterials (by using FIB) 

and in suitability for mass production (by ion irradiation through a mask).
