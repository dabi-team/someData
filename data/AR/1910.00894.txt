ABSTRACT 

The plasma β is important
to investigate interchanging roles of plasma and magnetic
pressure in the solar atmosphere. It can help to describe features over the photosphere and
their changes at different heights. The goal is to obtain the plasma β variations through the
solar corona during the solar cycles 23 and 24. The plasma β is reconstructed in different
layers of the solar atmosphere. For this purpose, we use an updated version of COronal
DEnsity and Temperature (CODET) model. In this version we selected different features in
the solar atmosphere such as Quiet Sun (QS), faculae and Active Regions (ARs). We
calculate the β variations at different layers in the solar corona (R= 1.14, 1.19, 1.23, 1.28,
). In the photosphere we use
1.34, 1.40, 1.46, 1.53, 1.61, 1.74, 1.79, 1.84 and 1.90

temperature values from FALC model to obtain plasma β in QS and faculae. Additionally,
variations of the magnetic and kinetic pressure were modelled during the last solar cycles at
coronal heights.

1. INTRODUCTION 

The structure of the solar atmosphere is complex, due to interchanging roles of plasma and
magnetic pressure. This behavior is usually described by the plasma β, because it relates
the gas pressure (kinetic pressure) and magnetic pressure. The rapid decrease in gas
or smaller there. In layers between
pressure in the upper atmosphere suggests that

  β ~ 1  

the photosphere and low chromosphere, β is roughly of order unity. The corona is a low-beta
plasma. Then, the magnetic forces dominate over kinetic pressures. On the other hand,
when β is high, kinetic forces dominate. In a low-beta plasma, the equilibrium field are
force-free (Aschwanden 2005; Priest & Hood 1991). One of the most relevant papers on
solar plasma β is Gary (2001), where a static magnetic field model of an active region was
used for calculating the average and limits of the plasma β across the solar atmosphere.
Recently, Wiegelmann et al. (2015) obtained some new constraints with IMaX data with a
the photosphere and chromosphere on network
non-linear magnetostatic model

elements. The plasma β may be an explanation for some solar processes, as penumbra
formation (Bourdin 2017). 
The plasma β is important to describe different physical phenomena in the solar atmosphere,
such as solar wind and how is it expelled. In general, the wide range on β (sometimes of
orders of magnitude in a given region) can be related to ejection events, reconnection
processes and drive some dynamics in loops (Gary 2001). The dynamics of the β plasma in
the solar atmosphere is not simple to describe, for example, in photosphere and lower
chromosphere, low and high-β regions exist side by side along with non magnetic forces.
The existence of
the plasma pressure and the gravity force are also
the gradient of
considered as parameters in Wiegelmann et al. (2015). 

Quiet Sun is an important feature in the solar atmosphere. It exhibits magnetic activity on a
broad range of scales (Bellot Rubio & Orozco Suárez 2019). Faculae regions represent
dispersed magnetic fields (van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015). Their dynamics may
contribute in some processes in solar chromosphere and corona. Then, the study of plasma
β in these features can contribute to understand interchanging roles of magnetic and kinetic
pressure at differents heights of solar atmosphere. In this paper we investigate the evolution
of plasma β, magnetic and kinetic pressure over the last two solar cycles. Additionally, we
describe changes in plasma β over different features: faculae, Quiet Sun and Active Regions
and their evolution in times of maximum and minimum of the last solar cycles.  

We structure the paper as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the plasma β model. In Sect. 3,
Plasma β evolution during the solar cycles 23 and 24 is presented. In sect. 4, Plasma β at
coronal heights is presented. In sect. 5, variations in magnetic and kinetic pressure are
described. Finally, we present the discussion and concluding remarks in Sect. 6. 

2. THE PLASMA β MODEL 

The plasma β is described through the magnetic and the kinetic pressure. In our model, we
assume flux tubes as pressure balanced elements between the inner and outer boundaries.
These tubes are assumed not to be curved and thus have no magnetic tension. Then, it is
possible to describe the plasma β as: 

2N K T
β = B /8π2

Boltzmann constant. In this approach, we could not directly employ the magnetic field
strength density from MDI/SOHO (Scherrer et al. 1995) and HMI/SDO (Scherrer et al. 2012).
These data are assimilated into the flux transport model of Schrijver (2001). The structure of

The density and temperature description were presented in Rodrı́guez Gómez et al. (2018)
on CODET model. For this work, we perform an update in CODET model. In the current
version, the model
is available to describe some features in the solar atmosphere, as
faculae, Active regions (ARs) and Quiet Sun regions (QS). We evaluate the behavior of
plasma β in these regions along with the kinetic and magnetic pressure during two solar
cycles. For these purposes, we defined some conditions to select different features in the
solar atmosphere (Table 1). 

These conditions were applied in the photosphere (

 R1 ⊙  

) and the model was applied to

these different conditions (magnetic regime) for all layers. Figure 1 shows binary maps for
Active Regions, faculae and Quiet Sun on Apr. 17 (2014). These conditions were included in
the update of CODET model. We perform a spatial averaging at different heights due to
structure of the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS). We obtain a mean value of magnetic
field, density and temperature at each height. Using these values we calculated the plasma
β in each feature at each height in solar atmosphere for each day. For our goals, it would be
useful to distinguish variations in plasma β during the solar cycle. Therefore we select some
days during the maximum and minimum of solar cycles 23 and 24. These results will be
presented in the following sections.

3. PLASMA β EVOLUTION DURING THE SOLAR CYCLES 23 AND 24 

The plasma β was calculated from Jul. 01 (1996) to Aug. 23 (2018). The average plasma β
value was calculated at coronal heights 1.14, 1.19, 1.23, 1.28, 1.34, 1.40, 1.46, 1.53, 1.61,
, following Rodrı́guez Gómez et al. (2018) the performance of
1.74, 1.79, 1.84 and 1.90

  R⊙  

the CODET model is suitable in these layers of the solar corona.  

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the plasma β over the last two solar cycles per day. The
plasma β was computed for all regions during the two solar cycles. After that, it was sorted
for QS, faculae and AR (Panels figure 2). In selected layers in the solar corona we obtain β >
1. These results are in agreement with expected values at coronal heights. The contributions
from faculae and Quiet Sun regions are higher compared to Active Regions during both solar
cycles. In general, plasma β and the contributions from faculae and Quiet Sun follow the
solar cycle. 

Table 2 shows maximum and minimum values of plasma β without distinguishing any feature
(total), faculae, Active Regions and Quiet Sun. Also, their respective heights and dates when
for
the maximum and minimum values occurs. Minimum values appear at a height of 1.40

in all cases. The maximum and minimum values

for the entire atmosphere occurs in the solar cycle 24. While, Faculae the minimum value
appears on the minimum of solar cycle and the maximum value occurs in the solar cycle 24.
Active regions shows a minimum value on solar cycle 24 and the maximum value on solar
cycle 23. This related to magnetic activity variations during each solar cycle. Quiet Sun
regions shows maximum and minimum values during solar cycle 24.

4. PLASMA β IN FUNCTION OF HEIGHT IN THE SOLAR ATMOSPHERE 

To compute the plasma β in the photosphere, we use the temperature values from FALC

Faculae. These models are created assure a reasonable behavior of spectrally integrated
radiative losses and to better match the SORCE/SIM observations (Fontenla et al. 2011).
We take an average value and calculate the standard error. We were selected the models

from CODET model (Rodrı́guez Gómez et al. 2018). We calculated the plasma β value for
these features at different days during the maximum and minimum of solar cycles 23 and 24
(Table 3.). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3 shows values of plasma β for Quiet Sun and faculae in selected days on solar cycles
23 and 24. However, modelling the ARs is more complex. We use some models to obtain
temperature values, but they do not match to the expected values in the photosphere. Then,
in this approach we do not use plasma β values over the ARs in the solar photosphere. In
order to check the values of plasma β related to the different features obtained from our
model, we decided to show the values corresponding to maxima and minima of solar cycles
23 and 24. Days were chosen randomly along the month from the 13-month averaged SSN
series. Maximum of cycle 23: Nov. 21 (2001). Minimum of cycle 23: Dec. 29 (1996) and Dec.
22 (2008). Maximum of cycle 24: Apr. 17 (2014). Minimum of cycle 24: Jan. 8 (2009).  

Values of β along maxima and minima of solar cycles 23 and 24 were plotted over the figure
3 of Gary (2001). The thick line represents the AR physical conditions, with magnetic field of
2500 G. The thin line represents a plage with 150 G. 

This approach allows to describe correctly the plasma β at photospheric heights for Quiet

Figures 3 to 5 shows plasma β values at photospheric and coronal heights. Faculae, Quiet
Sun and Active Regions were checked on selected days. Blue points shows plasma β on
faculae regions, red points correspond to Quiet Sun regions and black points to Active
Regions. We expected values of Active regions and faculae reach the left side, close to the
tick line due to the large magnetic field involved. This is related to higher magnetic field
regimes. On the right side close to the thin line, Quiet Sun values appear usually, due to
corresponding small magnetic field values.

The pressure values were examined during the last solar cycles. The main goal
is to
evaluate how the magnetic and kinetic pressure come into play during the each solar cycle.
We define the magnetic pressure

 as:

Figure 6 shows magnetic pressure variations along solar cycles 23 and 24 at coronal
heights. The magnetic pressure follows the solar cycle, showing higher values on solar cycle
23 compared to solar cycle 24. Higher contributions are due to faculae and Quiet Sun
regions during booth cycles. Figure 7 shows the kinetic pressure along the solar cycles 23
and 24. The kinetic pressure follows the solar cycle. Higher contributions are due to faculae
and Quiet Sun regions.

6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS 

The plasma β descriptions in different locations of the solar corona thus strongly depends on
the magnetic field model. In our case, we use the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) to
describe magnetic field at different heights of the solar corona. Besides, plasma β indeed
depends on density and temperature in solar corona. These quantities are considered a
great challenge because they are not estimated directly in long time scales. Therefore, it is
necessary use models to obtain a description of them. This is the case of CODET model.  

This model allows to describe temperature and density in the solar corona. Their description
is based on magnetic field through solar atmosphere. However, some techniques can help to
obtain density and temperature at different heights in the solar corona. e.g., the density can
be obtained from high resolution data and using tomographic inversion. The tomographic
technique and specifically the differential emission measure tomography (DEMT) provides a
reconstruction of the 3D distribution of the coronal electron density and temperature in the
inner corona (Vásquez 2016; Aschwanden 2011).  

This approach will be explored to obtain plasma β estimations in a future paper. In this work,
the evolution of plasma β during the last solar cycles were investigated. Also, we analyze the

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
variations of magnetic and kinetic pressure in the last solar cycles. The global behavior was
checked and the individual behavior in faculae, Quiet Sun and Active Regions. The plasma β
description of the updated version of CODET model is in agreement within the limits and
values presented in Gary (2001). Specifically, this version of CODET model is suitable to
in different features
describe plasma β variations in the solar corona from 1.14

to 1.90

R⊙  

R⊙  

as faculae, Quiet Sun (QS) and Active Regions (ARs). 

We notice that an interesting behavior is shown during the last solar cycles, when we select
different regions such as faculae, Active Regions and Quiet Sun. In Faculae and Quiet Sun
regions, higher values of β in average are shown in solar cycle 24 compared to solar cycle
23. The solar cycle 24 is characterized by lower magnetic activity, but the presence of higher
values in plasma β for faculae and Quiet Sun suggest that these features are predominant
and they can drive some phenomena during this cycle. We suggest that the role of the gas
pressure instead of strong magnetic forces is predominant in the solar cycle 24. In the case
of Active Regions the plasma β follow the solar cycle evolution corresponding to higher
values in the solar cycle 23 and lower values in the solar cycle 24 related to magnetic
activity. 
However, their values are lower compared to other features considered. It can be related to
the selection conditions on magnetic field regimes (Table 1) that were sought in the
) after the flux model was applied. This means that these values are
photosphere (1

R⊙  

slightly lower than photospheric magnetograms. 
We check some peak values showed on the different features (Figure 2). Plasma β on Quiet
Sun, faculae and Active Regions shows some particular peaks which deviate from the
average values. They are related to a lower temperature and density at coronal heights. A
special case occurred on Aug. 16 (2016) on Quiet Sun feature. It is related to an issue from
the magnetic flux transport model and it influences the temperature and density profiles.
Plasma β in function of height in the solar atmosphere is explored on specific days. Two
selected days during maximum of solar cycles 23 and 24. Nov. 21 (2001) and Apr. 17
(2014) were shown in Figure 3. Faculae and QS values in the photosphere are in
all regions in different magnetic intensity regimes,
accordance with Gary (2001). At 1.14

R⊙  

namely ARs, faculae and QS show values of plasma β outside of the limits proposed by
Gary (2001). In another layers plasma β values are in agreement with Gary (2001). During
selected days on solar maxima 23 and 24, we can follow the main Active regions with
coronal height. For minimum activity, on the minimum of solar cycle 23 (Figure 4), we can
describe only plasma β related to QS and faculae regions. We selected two days: Dec. 26
(1996) and Dec. 22 (2008). In photosphere and coronal heights values of plasma β are in
plasma β values are smaller than the proposed
agreement with Gary (2001). At 1.14

limits of Gary (2001). Bourdin (2017) in Fig 1, shows β in the upper boundary of the

Due to the large possible range of β, dynamics and physical conditions, values can be
different depending on observations and applied models (Bourdin 2017; Iwai et al. 2014).
Also, we selected two days: Jul. 16 (2009) and Jan. 08 (2009), during the minimum of solar
cycle 24. Plasma β were calculated for faculae and Quiet Sun regions. Their behavior is
similar to minimum of solar cycle 23.

minimum, QS shows higher values compared to faculae regions, presumably due to a
greater presence of QS regions during times of solar minima. 
The magnetic pressure (Figure 6) shows higher values during the solar cycle 23 compared
to the solar cycle 24. It is related to the magnetic intensity of the solar cycle. The major
contribution during the solar cycle 24 is related to QS and faculae regions. However, QS
magnetic pressure is strong during this cycle. The kinetic pressure shows an interesting
behavior
in solar cycle 23 (Figure 7). Faculae and Quiet Sun regions have higher
contribution into coronal dynamics. QS contribution is higher compared to faculae and ARs.
The solar cycle 24 shows low activity intensity compared to solar cycle 23. However, the QS
regions contribute in major part during this cycle. A pressure imbalance due to the higher
value of kinetic pressure occurred and higher values of β appear. In order to maintain a
positive total pressure, the background plasma pressure must be strong either the magnetic
pressure is so weak that the average plasma β becomes very high. 

These results give an interesting outlook about the solar cycle dynamics. The faculae and
Quiet Sun regions drive variations in magnetic and kinetic pressure at coronal heights.
However, it is important to know the behavior of plasma β at chromosphere and transition
regions. Nevertheless the current description is not available for this purpose, but we
expected to explore this on outcoming paper.
