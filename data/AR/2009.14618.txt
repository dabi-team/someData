The surface atomic and electronic structure after deposition of 1/3 monolayer (ML) Te on Cu(111)
was determined using a combination of low-energy electron diﬀraction (LEED), scanning tunnel-
ing microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), angle-resolved single and two-photon photoelectron
spectroscopy (ARPES /AR-2PPE) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Contrary to
the current state in literature Te does not create a two-dimensional surface alloy but forms Cu2Te2
√3(cid:1) R30◦ superstructure. We establish this by a high-precision LEED-
adsorbate chains in a (cid:0)2√3
IV structural analysis with Pendry R factor of R = 0.099 and corroborating DFT and STM results.
The electronic structure of the surface phase is dominated by an anisotropic downward dispers-
ing state at the Fermi energy EF and a more isotropic upward dispersing unoccupied state at
E
EF = +1.43 eV. Both states coexist with bulk states of the projected band structure and are
therefore surface resonances.

Despite being explored for decades, the structural,
thermodynamic and electronic properties of Cu-Te
alloys1 and derived materials receive on-going interest
due to their relevance to back contacts in CdTe/CdS so-
lar cells2–6 and as thermoelectric materials7 along with
tellurides in general8. The latter application is also very
promising in a nanoscale form to be incorporated directly
into state-of-the-art electronic devices. Bulk CuTe has
received attention as a material hosting a charge den-
sity wave9. Tellurides but particularly CuTe nanocrys-
tals have shown distinct plasmonic properties, their de-
pendence on structure has still to be understood10–13.
Further interest arises as tellurides are important ma-
terials in the ﬁeld of (crystalline) topological insulators,
their structural richness and potentially tunable proper-
ties open a wide range of applications14,15.

From all these examples it becomes clear that any
analysis of this complex alloy system1 must deliver an
unequivocal determination of the atomic and electronic
structure of the system in question. If it comes to thin
ﬁlms or low-dimensional materials, molecular beam epi-
taxy is a method that allows to exert atomic-scale control
over the growing structure and therefore is particularly
suited to help revealing structure-property relations. To
understand the nucleation and the formation of interfaces
one needs to start with a low Te coverage Θ. For the par-
ticular case of Θ = 1/3 ML of Te on Cu(111) attempts
have been made over the years16–20 but a true reliable
structural analysis is still missing. Seemingly, there is
√3(cid:1) R30◦ superstructure, but
an agreement on a (cid:0)√3
from our work we can infer that such a structure only
occurs at much higher Te coverage or under the inﬂu-

mine the ground-state atomic structure of Θ = 1/3 ML
of Te on Cu(111) and analyze its electronic structure by
a multimethod approach utilizing LEED-IV, STM/STS,
ARPES/AR-2PPE and DFT.

1/3 ML of Te was deposited on a clean Cu(111)
substrate at 100 K in ultra-high vacuum (UHV,
low
10−11 mbar regime). Subsequently, the crystal was an-
nealed to temperatures in the range of 470 to 870 K.

×

×

Invariably,
this and other variations of the prepa-
ration procedure we tested (see21) led to the same
√3(cid:1) R30◦
(cid:0)2√3
surface structure as identiﬁed by
(Fig. 1(a)) and LEED-IV spectra
LEED patterns
(Fig. 2(c)).
In the following we will use an equivalent
rectangular cell as primitive unit cell that is denoted as
√3)rect and indicated in green in Figs. 1(a) and (d).
(3
A characteristic of the LEED pattern is the systematic
absence of half-order spots along the main axes indicat-
ing a glide symmetry plane of the structure in [¯1¯12] di-
rection. The analysis of the LEED patterns revealed that
up to annealing temperatures of 570 K the LEED spots
sharpened due to improving lateral order. Beyond that
temperature the LEED pattern becomes dominated by
√3)rect
one or two symmetry related domains of the (3
superstructure21 indicating a tendency to form large sin-
gle domains on terraces with preferential orientation.

×

STM imaging reveals the real space topology and gives
a meaningful impression on the crystallographic struc-
ture. This can limit the number of possible models that
need to be tested in a structural analysis. For a proper Te
coverage the surface is completely covered by three diﬀer-
ently oriented domains of a stripy structure with chains
running along [¯1¯12] and equivalent substrate directions
(Fig. 1(b) and (c)). With increasing annealing temper-
ature the terraces become more and more mono-domain
(Fig. 1(c) and Supplemental Material (SM)21). Diﬀerent
to the clean Cu(111) surface, where close-packed [1¯10]
√3)rect phase strongly sta-
step edges dominate, the (3
×
bilizes a step orientation along the [2¯1¯1] chain directions.
Depending on temperature, step edges are rearranged by
the superstructure either locally (Fig. 1(b)) or on a meso-
scopic scale (Fig. 1(c)). If the step direction needs to be
changed to keep the average surface orientation, narrow
stripes of a rotated domain are formed both at the lower
and upper terrace of a step, cf. Fig. 1(c). As demon-
strated in the SM21 even an unavoidable miscut of the
surface of less than 0.1◦ leads to a disproportion of do-
main weights for high temperature annealing. Hence,
an intentional small misorientation towards [1¯10] may

quence of bright bumps along the chain direction. The
chains appear separated by troughs of lower height com-
pared to the inner region of the chains themselves. The
surface density of the bright features is exactly 1/3 of a
monolayer. Consequently, they can at least tentatively
be assigned to Te atoms. At the boundaries between
two domains locally a new bridging superstructure with
2√3(cid:1) R30◦ unit cell is formed to cross-link the
a (cid:0)2√3
two chain directions (c.f. lower part of Fig. 1(d)).

For the LEED structural analysis LEED-IV spectra
8.9 keV were col-
over a total energy range of ∆E
lected. The ﬁnal best-ﬁt structure reproduced the ex-
perimental data with a Pendry R factor of R = 0.099
determining in total 35 structural and non-structural pa-
rameters with a redundancy factor of ρ = 15 (Fig. 2(c)).
The resulting best-ﬁt structure is that of Cu2Te2 chains
exhibiting the required glide symmetry plane. DFT cal-
culations independently prove this structure to be a state
of minimal energy. The DFT structural relaxation agrees
within single picometers with the results from the LEED
structural analysis (Fig. 2(b)) and simulated STM im-
ages perfectly reproduce the imaging contrast and con-
ﬁrm that the bright features are Te atoms (Fig. 1(d)).
Both LEED and DFT therefore give a uniﬁed picture of
√3)rect structure and its impact on the substrate
the (3
geometry depicted in Fig. 2(a) and (b). The Cu atoms of
the chain reside on hcp sites of the substrate. Te atoms

×

are in total sixfold coordinated to Cu atoms (3 within
the chains and 3 to the substrate), while Cu atoms of the
chain have in total 8 neighbors, 3 Te and 5 Cu atoms. The
Te atoms do not sit exactly on hcp sites, but are pushed
away by 0.14 ˚A perpendicular to the chain direction to-
wards the adjacent bridge site. As a consequence, ﬁrst,
Te atoms buckle outwards with respect to the Cu plane
by 0.19 ˚A (DFT: 0.24 ˚A). Second, within the chain the Te-
Cu bonds along [¯101] are with 2.63 ˚A signiﬁcantly shorter
than those along [¯110] (LEED: 2.71 ˚A, DFT: 2.69 ˚A). And
lastly, the Te-Te distance across the troughs is only 4.17 ˚A
compared to 4.66 ˚A across the chain, hence there is no
space for additional Cu atoms between the chains. Fur-
ther details of the structural analysis including the best-
ﬁt values of all parameters, their errors, and the distor-
tion of the substrate are discussed in the SM21.

We investigated the surface electronic structure of the
chain phase using ARPES, AR-2PPE, STS, and DFT.
The results are depicted in Fig. 3. Applying laser-based
ARPES and AR-2PPE we identify four electronic fea-
tures labeled α, β, γ, and δ in Fig. 3(a). The crystal was
aligned such that k|| is along Γ K of the Cu(111) Brillouin
zone (BZ). Due to the presence of three equivalent rota-
tional domains, the data correspond to a superposition
of emission along a k-path perpendicular to the chains
30◦ to the chains as indicated in the inset of
and at
Fig. 3(a). Hence, the splitting of the feature α is not
attributed to a spin-orbit split state, but to the superpo-
sition of a more weakly dispersing band perpendicular to
the chains [Γ J’] and a direction 30 oﬀ the chains which
has a stronger dispersion similar to that along [Γ J]. A
slight intensity around E
EF = 0.7 eV is caused by the
two-photon excitation of the state δ (c.f. Fig. S2 of21).
The very weak feature β is not easily presentable in the
grayscale plot without saturating the signal of the other
states. The proof of its existence and the analysis of its
dispersion is presented in the SM21.

We compare the ARPES data with the spatial average
of normalized dI/dV STS data (Fig. 3(b)). The gray
band represents the standard deviation of 380 individual
spectra. We interpret the missing spatial dependence of
the spectra as a consequence of the lateral extension of
the STM tip that does not allow to probe the ”troughs”
of the structure separately from the chains. The features
identiﬁed by photoelectron spectroscopy show up clearly
as onsets (α, γ) or strong increase in slope (β, δ) at the
same energies.

To interpret the experimental data we performed
band structure calculations including spin-orbit coupling
(Fig. 3(c)). We used a relatively large slab consisting of
the Cu2Te2 structure added on 14 layers of Cu(111). By
this it becomes apparent that the bandgap at the L point
of Cu(111) (Γ) is completely closed by back-folded bulk
bands. The eﬀect of the spin-orbit coupling is found to

Te 5p-states with Cu 4sp and 3d states, respectively. The
analysis also shows that the apparent splitting of the α-
state in the ARPES data of Fig. 3(a) measured along Γ K
of the Cu(111) BZ is entirely due to the clear anisotropy
of the electronic structure along and perpendicular to the
Cu2Te2 chains ([Γ J] and [Γ J’] respectively). The onset

Our results contradict the ﬁndings of others who claim
that the deposition of 1/3 ML Te leads to the forma-
√3(cid:1) R30◦
tion of a Cu2Te-surface alloy with a (cid:0)√3
supercell18–20. Only one early investigation reported a
√3(cid:1) R30◦ structure for this coverage17. Using
(cid:0)2√3
surface extended x-ray absorption ﬁne-structure it was
found that the structure consists of Te-Cu bonds ori-
ented predominantly within the surface plane compat-
ible with our ﬁndings. A more detailed model could
not be provided17. Although none of the above pa-
pers could provide structural data at the level dis-
cussed here, we investigated this matter thoroughly by
checking independently the preparation and evolution
of phases when depositing Te in all three UHV cham-
bers used in our study. Only in one of our UHV sys-

the mentioned metastable (cid:0)√3
gered by additional adsorbates may be a transforma-
tion of the Cu2Te2 ground-state phase to the honeycomb
phase. Therefore, we suggest that in Refs.19,20 this phase
was investigated but interpreted in the framework of a
surface alloy. The ARPES data shown in Ref. 20 would
support this view23.

A recent paper investigated the growth of Te on
Cu2Sb(111) under very similar preparation conditions as
the present system24. The authors claim that Te forms
zigzag chains on the substrate that have a signiﬁcant dis-

tance of 2.99 ˚A from the surface and are therefore decou-
pled. Although the Sb from the CuSb(111) substrate
might introduce a diﬀerent Te growth behavior than on
Cu(111), we would like to point out that the DFT sim-
ulation derived from our Cu2Te2 chain model (1(d)) ﬁts
much better the STM images of phase S2 than simula-
tions based on Te2 chains (Figs. 1 and 2 of Ref. 24) sug-
gesting that the two have the same structure.

√3(cid:1) R30◦ or equivalently (3

In conclusion, by a LEED-IV structural analysis with
Pendry R factor R = 0.099 we have established that
the ground state of 1/3 ML Te on Cu(111) is a chain-
√3)rect super-
like (cid:0)2√3
structure in which Cu2Te2 chains are formed on top of
the otherwise unreconstructed surface. The Te and Cu
atoms in the chains sit on or close to hcp hollow sites.
DFT calculations conﬁrm all structural parameters of the
LEED analysis independently. At the correct Te coverage
and after annealing steps the structure exhibits a close
to perfect order with very little point defects and domain
boundaries. A mutual inﬂuence between surface steps
and the orientation of the Cu2Te2 chains was observed.
The analysis of the electronic structure by ARPES, AR-
2PPE, and STS reveals two dominant Te induced states
on the surface: a downward dispersing and anisotropic
occupied state at the Fermi energy EF and an upward
dispersing unoccupied state at E
EF = 1.43 eV. DFT
calculations indicate a spin-orbit splitting of the order
of 50 meV. Thus we arrive at a complete structural and

electronic understanding of the system.

Previous attempts to unravel the surface structure re-
sulted in inconsistent ﬁndings of experiment and theory.
The diﬃculties arise due to the presence of a metastable
√3(cid:1) R30◦ superstruc-
CuTe honeycomb phase in a (cid:0)√3
ture that has been interpreted as a substitutional alloy.
Our ﬁndings clearly disprove the occurrence of a substi-
tutional Cu2Te alloy and reveal the true initial growth

band structure calculation of a honeycomb TeCu layer on
Cu(111) that matches the experimental ARPES data. A
potential Cu2Te alloy has a distinctly diﬀerent band struc-
ture.
