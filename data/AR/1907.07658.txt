THE STEINER k-RADIUS AND STEINER k-DIAMETER OF
CONNECTED GRAPHS FOR k ≥ 4

JOSIAH REISWIG

Abstract. Given a connected graph G = (V, E) and a vertex set S ⊂ V , the Steiner
distance d(S) of S is the size of a minimum spanning tree of S in G. For a connected graph
G of order n and an integer k with 2 ≤ k ≤ n, the k-eccentricity of a vertex v in G is the
maximum value of d(S) over all S ⊂ V with |S| = k and v ∈ S. The minimum k-eccentricity,
sradk(G), is called the k-radius of G while the maximum k-eccentricity, sdiamk(G), is called
the k-diameter of G. In 1990, Henning, Oellermann, and Swart [Ars Combinatoria 12 13-
19, (1990)] showed that there exists a graph Hk such that sdiamk(Hk) = 2(k+1)
2k−1 sradk(Hk).
The authors also conjectured that for any k ≥ 2 and connected graph G sdiamk(G) ≤
2(k+1)
2k−1 sradk(G). The authors provided proofs of the conjecture for k = 3 and 4. Their proof
for k = 4, however, was incomplete. In this note, we disprove the conjecture for k ≥ 5 by
proving that the bound sdiamk(G) ≤ k+3
k+1 sradk(G) is tight for k ≥ 5. We then provide a
complete proof for k = 4 and identify the error in the previous proof of this case.

1. Introduction and Notation

Given a graph G = (V, E) with vertex set V = V (G) and edge set E = E(G), we let
|G| = |V (G)| denote the order of G and kGk = |E(G)| denote the size of G. The distance
in G between two vertices u, v ∈ V , denoted dG(u, v), is the length of the shortest path in
G between u and v. If there is no path between u and v, we say that dG(u, v) = ∞. The
eccentricity of a vertex v in G is deﬁned as e(v) := max{dG(u, v) : u ∈ V (G)}. The radius
rad(G) is deﬁned as min{e(v) : v ∈ V (G)} and the diameter of G diam(G) is deﬁned as
max{e(v) : v ∈ V (G)}. The center of G, denoted C(G), is the subset of vertices v ∈ G such
that e(v) = srad(G). If H is a subgraph of G and v ∈ V (G), then the distance from v to H,
denoted dG(v, H), is deﬁned as min{dG(v, u) : u ∈ V (H)}. The neighborhood of a vertex v,
is deﬁned as NG(v) := {u : uv ∈ E(G)}.

The distance between two vertices v and u can be viewed as the minimal size of a connected
subgraph (in this case, a path) of G containing v and u. This suggests a generalization of
distance. Introduced in [2], the Steiner distance in G of a non-empty set S ⊂ V (G), denoted
dG(S), is deﬁned as the size of the smallest connected subgraph of G containing all elements
of S. Necessarily, such a minimum subgraph must be a tree. When the context is clear, we
simply write dG(S) as d(S).

Given an integer k ≥ 2, the Steiner k-eccentricity of a vertex v in G, denoted ek(v), is
deﬁned as the maximum Steiner distance of all vertex subsets of G of size k containing
v. More succinctly, ek(v) = maxS⊂V (G),|S|=k{d(S) : v ∈ S}. The Steiner k-radius, denoted
sradk(G), is then deﬁned as sradk(G) := min{ek(v) : v ∈ G}, while the Steiner k-diameter,
denoted sdiamk(G) is then deﬁned as sdiamk(G) := max{ek(v) : v ∈ G}. The Steiner k-
center, Ck(G), is the subgraph induced by all vertices v with ek(v) = sradk(G). For a

general connected graph, the following connection between the Steiner distance and the
standard distance is immediate.

Observation 1. If G is a connected graph and v ∈ V (G), then e2(v) = e(v), srad2(G) =
rad(G), sdiam2(G) = diam(G), and C2(G) = C(G).

Much research has been focused on bounding the Steiner k-diameter by other parameters.
Danklemann, Swart, and Oellermann in [3] gave upper bounds for sdiamk(G) with respect to
the minimum degree and complement of G. In [1], Ali gave an upper bounds for sdiamk(G)
with respect to the girth of G.
In this paper, we will bound sdiamk(G) with respect to
sradk(G).

In light of Observation 1, it is well known that sdiam2(G) ≤ 2 srad2(G). In their paper
introducing the Steiner distance, the authors of [2] generalized this result by showing that
for any tree T ,

sdiamk(T ) ≤

sradk(T ).

k
k − 1

The authors conjectured that this result extended to all connected graphs. In 1990, however,
Henning, Oellermann, and Swart [4] showed via construction that for each k ≥ 2, there exists
a graph G∗ satisfying sdiamk(G∗) = 2(k+1)
2k−1 sradk(G∗). Furthermore, they conjectured that this
gap was largest possible.

Conjecture 2 (See [4]). Suppose that G is a connected graph with order at least k. Then

2(k + 1)
2k − 1
In the same paper, proofs of the conjecture were provided for k = 3, 4. The proof for

sdiamk(G) ≤

sradk(G).

k = 4, however, was incorrect.

We break this writing into several divisions. In Section 2, we make necessary deﬁnitions
and prove some preliminary lemmas required for our main results. In Section 3, we prove
our main result:

Theorem 3. If G is a connected graph and k ≥ 5 is an integer, then

sradk(G).

sdiamk(G) ≤

k + 3
k + 1
In Section 4 we show that this bound is tight. In Section 5, we provide a correct proof
to conﬁrm the conjecture in [4] for k = 4 building on the portions proven in [4]. Following
this, in Section 7, we identify the error in the proof of Conjecture 2 for k = 4 provided
in [4]. Finally, Section 6 provides the correct arguments originally presented in [4] for the
case k = 4 to complete the proof. To summarize the results of this paper and related results,
Table 1 gives the maximum value of the ratio sdiamk(G)/ sradk(G) for a connected graph G
as prescribed by [4] and Theorem 3.

2. Definitions and preliminary lemmas

Let k ≥ 2 be a positive integer and suppose that G is a connected graph of order at
least k. Then there exists a set D = {v1, v2, . . . , vk} ⊂ V (G) such that d(D) = sdiamk(G).
Similarly, there exists v0 ∈ V (G) satisfying ek(v0) = sradk(G). We may now make the
following deﬁnitions, which closely follow deﬁnitions made in [4].

Deﬁnition 4. Suppose that G is a connected graph of order at least k. Assume that D =
{v1, v2, . . . , vk} with d(D) = sdiamk(G) and ek(v0) = sradk(G). For each 1 ≤ i ≤ k,

(1) Deﬁne Di := (D \ {vi}) ∪ {v0};
(2) Deﬁne Ti to be a Steiner tree for Di;
(3) Deﬁne T ′
(4) Deﬁne ℓi := kTik − kT ′

i to be the smallest subtree of Ti containing Di \ {v0};

i k. Without loss of generality, we assume that ℓ1 ≤ ℓj for

j ≥ 2.

Of course, if v0 ∈ D, we have that sradk(G) = sdiamk(G). So if sradk(G) < sdiamk(G) we
must have v0 /∈ D. It is worth noting that vi is the only element of D ∪ {v0} not necessarily
contained in the tree Ti, while the tree T ′
i need not contain v0. Figure 1 illustrates the
diﬀerence between the trees T1 and T ′

1 for k = 3.

Note that ℓi = dTi(v0, T ′

i ). From Deﬁnition 4, we make the following observation.

Observation 5. Suppose that k ≥ 2 is an integer and that G is a connected graph with at
least k vertices. Let ℓi, Ti, and T ′
i be deﬁned as in Deﬁnition 4. If sdiamk(G) > p sradk(G)
for some p > 0, then for each 1 ≤ i ≤ k, we have the following:

(1) kTik ≤ sradk(G) <

(2) kT ′

i k = kTik − ℓi <

sdiamk(G) − ℓ1.

With Observation 5 in mind, we now prove our ﬁrst lemma.

Lemma 6. Suppose that G is a connected graph of order n ≥ k. Let ℓi, Ti, and T ′
i be deﬁned
as in Deﬁnition 4. If sdiamk(G) > p · sradk(G) with p > 1, then for 1 < i, j ≤ k with i 6= j,
the following hold:

(1) dT1(vi, v0) >

(2) dT1(vi, vj) >

Proof. For the ﬁrst inequality, note that adjoining the tree Ti with the path in T1 between
vi and v0 generates a connected subgraph of G spanning D. Hence,

which implies that

kTik + dT1(vi, v0) ≥ sdiamk(G),

dT1(vi, v0) ≥ sdiamk(G) − kTik.

In view of Observation 5, we see that

dT1(vi, v0) > sdiamk(G) −

For the second inequality, we similarly note that adjoining the tree T ′

With Lemma 6 in hand, we derive the following corollary.

Corollary 7. Using the deﬁnitions and notations provided in Deﬁnition 4, if 1 < i 6= j ≤ k
and

sdiamk(G) >

then

(1) dT1(vi, v0) > 3
(2) dT1(vi, vj) > 3

Furthermore, if 1 < i 6= j ≤ k and

then

(2) dT1(vi, vj) > 2

k+3 sdiamk(G) + ℓ1.

With these deﬁnitions and results in hand, we are prepared to prove our main result.

Suppose D = {v1, v2, . . . , vk} is a set of k vertices such that d(D) = sdiamk(G). Let v0 ∈
Ck(G). For 1 ≤ i ≤ k, deﬁne Di, Ti, T ′
i , and ℓi as in Deﬁnition 4. Again, we assume that
ℓ1 ≤ ℓj for j ≥ 2. We have that kT1k ≤ sradk(G). Let x be the vertex in T ′
1, which is closest
to v0 in T1. It is possible that x = v0. We now root T1 at v0 and consider the following two
cases.
Case 1: x ∈ Di \ {v0} = {v2, . . . , vk}.

Since x ∈ Di, we have that dT1(v0, x) = dT1(v0, vi) for some 2 ≤ i ≤ k. Then, by
Corollary 7, we have ℓ1 > 2
k+3 sdiamk(G). Traversing T1 via a depth ﬁrst search and returning
to v0 induces a new labeling of the elements of D1 in the following way: Let u1, u2, . . . , uk−1
be a relabeling of the vertices v2, . . . , vk in the order in which these vertices are visited
ﬁrst in the depth ﬁrst search. By Corollary 7, we have that dT1(v0, u1) > 2
k+3 sdiamk(G)
and dT1(v0, uk−1) > 2
k+3 sdiamk(G). Furthermore, Corollary 7 asserts that dT1(ui, uj) >
k+3 sdiamk(G) + ℓ1. Since ℓ1 > 2

Since k ≥ 5, we have contradicted equation (1).

Case 2: x /∈ Di \ {v0}.
Since x /∈ Di \ {v0}, we have that x has at least 2 children. Pick a child of x, say c. Let
H1 be the tree induced by vertices of the v0c path and descendants of c, and let H2 be the
tree obtained from T1 by removing c and its descendants. Figure 3 illustrates the diﬀerences
between T1, H1, and H2.

Both H1 and H2 contain elements of Di. We observe that E(H1) ∪ E(H2) = E(T1) while

the intersection of E(H1) and E(H2) is the path in T1 between v0 and x. Hence,

kH1k + kH2k − ℓ1 = kT1k <

sdiamk(G).

It is easy to see that |V (H1) ∩ D1| + |V (H2) ∩ D1| = k + 1 since v0 (and only v0) is included
in both subtrees. As in the previous case, we root H1 and H2 at v0 and perform a depth ﬁrst
search traversal of each subtree. By the same reasoning as the previous case, we see that

4. Sharpness of Theorem 3

We now prove that this bound in Theorem 3 is tight via a construction. Let k ≥ 5 be an

integer. We now outline the construction of a graph Gk satisfying

sdiamk(Gk) =

k + 3
k + 1

sradk(Gk).

Begin with a set of k independent vertices, D = {d1, d2, . . . , dk}. Let m = ⌈ k+1
2 ⌉. Deﬁne
D1 = {d1, d2, . . . , dm} and D2 = {dm, dm+1, . . . , dk}. For each vertex di ∈ D1, adjoin to each
vertex in D1 \ {di} a new vertex ai. Let A be the set these new vertices all such vertices.
Similarly, for each vertex dj ∈ D2 deﬁne a new vertex bj to be a vertex with N(bu) = D2\{dj}.
Let B be the set of all such vertices. Finally, adjoin a new vertex r to each vertex in A ∪ B.
This completes the construction of Gk. Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate the graphs of G5
and G6, respectively.

We now show that sdiamk(Gk) = k + 3 and sradk(Gk) = k + 1 via the Claims 8 and 9.

Claim 8. In the graph Gk, we have ek(r) = k + 1.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that ek(r) ≤ k + 1. Suppose that S ∈
with r ∈ S such that
d(S) = ek(r). Note that |D ∩ S| ≤ k − 1 which implies that there exist a, b ∈ A ∪ B such that
(S ∩ D) ⊆ (N(a) ∪ N(b)). So the Steiner tree of S ∪ {a, b} has order at most k + 2 and size
at most k + 1. Since S ⊆ (S ∪ {a, b}), we have d(S) ≤ k + 1. This implies that ek(r) ≤ k + 1.
To show that ek(r) ≥ k + 1, consider the set R = {r, d1, d2, . . . , dk−1}. Since |R ∩ D| >
⌈k/2⌉ + 1, any Steiner tree of R must contain at least two elements of A ∪ B. So any Steiner
tree of R must have order k + 2 and size k + 1. Hence, ek(r) ≥ d(R) ≥ k + 1. A Steiner tree

Steiner trees are in bold.

Recall that srad(Gk) ≤ ek(r), which implies that sradk(Gk) ≤ k + 1. So by Theorem 3 we
need only ﬁnd a vertex v ∈ V (Gk) with ek(v) ≥ k + 3 to prove that sradk(Gk) = k + 1 and
sdiamk(Gk) = k + 3. This will show that Theorem 3 is tight. We now consider the vertex
d1.

Claim 9. In the graph Gk, ek(d1) = k + 3.

Proof. Note that D ∈
and d1 ∈ D so d(D) ≤ ek(d1). Let T be a Steiner tree of D.
Since |D| = k, we have |V (T ) ∩ (A ∪ B)| ≥ 3. If |V (T ) ∩ (A ∪ B)| = 4, then |T | ≥ k + 4 and
kT k ≥ k + 3.

We now suppose |V (T ) ∩ (A ∪ B)| = 3. This implies that either |V (T ) ∩ A| = 2 or
|V (T ) ∩ B| = 2. Without loss of generality, we suppose the former. This implies that
V (T ) ∩ B = {bm}. Since T is connected, T contains a path from dm to bm. Such a path
either contains a second element from B or the vertex r. Since |V (T ) ∩ B| = 1, we must
have that T contains r. Hence, |T | ≥ k + 4 and kT k ≥ k + 3. We have now shown that
(cid:3)
ek(d1) ≥ k + 3.

We have shown in Claim 8 ek(r) ≤ k +1 and in Claim 9 that ek(d1) ≥ k +3. With Claims 9
and 8 in hand, we have sradk(Gk) ≤ k + 1 and sdiamk(Gk) ≥ k + 3. Applying Theorem 3,
we infer the following proposition, which shows the bound in Theorem 3 is tight.

Proposition 10. For k ≥ 5 the graph Gk satisﬁes sdiamk(Gk) = k+3 and sradk(Gk) = k+1.

5. Proof of Conjecture 2 for k = 4

We now consider the case of k = 4. Following the methods in [4], we suppose towards a

contradiction that there exists a connected graph G satisfying

sdiam4(G) >

10
7

srad4(G).

Suppose that D = {v1, v2, v3, v4} is a set of vertices in G such that d(D) = sdiam4(G) and
suppose v0 ∈ C4(G). For 1 ≤ i ≤ 4, deﬁne Di, Ti, T ′
i , and ℓi as in Deﬁnition 4. Again, we
assume that ℓ1 ≤ ℓj for j ≥ 2.
Remark: In [4], the authors show that such a counterexample must satisfy the following
two properties:

(1) For each 1 ≤ i ≤ 4, the tree Ti must have exactly four leaves. We label the leaves
share a nearest vertex si of degree at least 3

so that v0 and u(i)

After proving these claims, the authors deﬁne T ′′
the vertices in the u(i)

In reference to tree T1, we consider the sum

2(ℓ1 + a1 + b1 + c1 + d1) = (ℓ1 + c1) + (c1 + d1 + b1) + (a1 + b1) + (ℓ1 + d1 + a1).

By Corollary 7, the left hand side is bounded below by

(ℓ1 + c1) + (c + d1 + b1) + (a1 + b1) + (ℓ1 + d1 + a1) >

12
10

sdiam4(G) + 2ℓ1,

while, as in the previous case, by equation (4), we have that the right hand side is bounded
below by

2(ℓ1 + a1 + b1 + c1 + d1) = 2kTik <

sdiam4(G).

Combining these inequalities together, we have that

2ℓ1 + 2(ℓ1 + a1 + b1 + c1 + d1) = (ℓ1 + d1 + b1) + (ℓ1 + d1 + a1) + 2(ℓ1 + c1) + (a1 + b1).

Applying Corollary 7, we see that

(ℓ1 + d1 + b1) + (ℓ1 + d1 + a1) + 2(ℓ1 + c1) + (a1 + b1) >

But by equation (4), we have that

2ℓ1 + 2(ℓ1 + a1 + b1 + c1 + d1) <

sdiam4(G) + 2ℓ1.

Combining these inequalities together, we see that

sdiam4(G) + ℓ1 <

G exists and the result is proven.

Examining a previous proof

We now examine to the proof for k = 4 presented in [4]. The authors of [4] show correctly

that if G is a graph with sdiam4(G) >

must satisfy ℓ1 <

In their displayed equations 8, 9, and 10 of Case 2 of Theorem 3 in [4], the authors make

sdiam4(G) for any u, v ∈ D ∪ {v0}.

sdiam4(G) and d(u, v) >

srad4(G), then, in reference to Deﬁnition 4, G

the following claims:

Claim 11 (See [4], Case 2 of Theorem 3). If G is a graph satisfying ℓ1 <

d(u, v) >

sdiam4(G) for any u, v ∈ D ∪ {v0}. In reference to Figure 7,

2 k + a1 + d1 + ℓ1 ≥ sdiam4(G)
3 k + b1 + d1 + ℓ1 ≥ sdiam4(G).

The ﬁrst of these claims is violated by the graph H illustrated in Figure 8. We obtain H
by taking a the complete bipartite graph K4,4 with bipartite sets U = {u1, u2, u3, u4} and
V = {v1, v2, v3, v4} and deleting the matching {u1v4, u2v3, u3v2, u4v1}. We then adjoin a new
vertex v0 to each vertex in U. Finally, we subdivide the edge v0u4 once and each edge of the
form uv where u ∈ U and v ∈ V we subdivide ﬁve times. This gives the following distances
in H:

d(v0, ui) = 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3; d(v0, u4) = 2; and d(ui, vj) = 6 where i 6= 5 − j.

In reference to the tree Ti in Figure 7 as a subgraph of the graph H in Figure 8, we have
that in the tree T1 satisﬁes the following: a1 = 6, b1 = 6, c1 = 6, d1 = 0, and ℓ1 = 2. We
have that

srad4(H) = e4(v0) = 3(6) + 2 = 20

while

sdiam4(H) = d(v1, v2, v3, v4) = 4(6) + 2(1) = 26.
In reference to the graph H, from the ﬁrst displayed equation in Claim 11, we have that
kT ′′

2 k = 2(6) + 1 = 13, while within the tree T1, we have a1 = 6, and b1 = 6. So

2 k + a1 + b1 = 25 < sdiam4(H),
which contradicts the ﬁrst inequality in Claim 11. The remaining inequalities in Claim 11
can be violated graphs similar to H.

6. Completing the proof for k = 4 using arguments from [4]

For completeness, we show that if G is a graph satisfying sdiam4(G) >

srad4(G), then
each subtree Ti as in Deﬁnition 4 contains four leaves. This section restates the arguments
correctly presented in [4] using the notation of this paper.

Proof. Suppose G is a graph satisfying

sdiam4(G) >

srad4(G).

This implies that

Suppose that D = {v1, v2, v3, v4} is a set of vertices in G such that d(D) = sdiam4(G) and
v0 ∈ C4(G). For 1 ≤ i ≤ 4, deﬁne Di, Ti, T ′
i , and ℓi as in Deﬁnition 4. Again, we assume
that ℓ1 ≤ ℓj for j ≥ 2.

srad4(G) <

sdiam4(G).

We consider the cases where T1 is a path or a subdivision of the star on three vertices.
First, suppose that T1 is a path. Relabel the elements of D1 as u1, u2, u3 and u4 so that the
tree T1 is a concatenation of paths u1 − u2 − u3 − u4. See Figure 9 for an illustration of this
situation.

Now, T1 is composed of three paths between elements of Di. By Corollary 7, each of these

paths has length at least

sdiam4(G). So

srad4(G) ≥ ||T1|| >

which contradicts equation (4).

Next, we suppose T1 has exactly three leaves. Label them as u1, u2, and u3. Let u4 be the
element of D1 which is an interior vertex of T1 and let s be the vertex of degree 3 in T1. It
is possible that s = u4. Without loss of generality, suppose that u4 lies on the s − u3 path
in T1. Deﬁne the following distances as illustrated in Figure 10.

a := dT1(u1, s)
b := dT1(u2, s)
c := dT1(u3, u4) d := dT1(u4, s).

Consider the following sum:

(a + b) + (a + d) + (b + d) + 2c = 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d.

The right hand side of this equation counts each edge of T1 twice. Hence, by equation (4),

(5)

2a + 2b + 2c + 2d = 2kT1k ≤ 2 srad4(G) <

sdiam4(G).

But Corollary 7 implies that the left hand side of the equation is bounded below by

(a + b) + (a + d) + (b + d) + 2c ≥ 5 · min{dT1(ui, uj) : 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ 4}
