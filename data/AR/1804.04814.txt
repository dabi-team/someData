Abstract. Magnetic reconnections (MRs) for various magnetic ﬁeld line (MFL) topologies are
believed to be the initiators of various solar eruptive events like ﬂares and coronal mass ejections
(CMEs). Consequently, important is a thorough understanding and quantiﬁcation of the MFL
topology and their evolution which leads to MRs. Contemporary standard is to extrapolate
the coronal MFLs using equilibrium models where the Lorentz force on the coronal plasma is
zero everywhere, because either there is no current or the current is parallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld. In tandem, a non-force-free-ﬁeld (NFFF) extrapolation scheme has evolved and allows for a
Lorentz force which is non-zero only at the photosphere but asymptotically vanishes with height.
The paper reports magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)- simulations initiated by NFFF extrapolation
of the coronal MFLs for the active region NOAA 11158. Interestingly, quasi-separatrix layers
(QSLs) which facilitate MRs are detected in the extrapolated MFLs. The AR 11158 is ﬂare
producing and, the paper makes an attempt to asses the role of QSLs in the ﬂare onsets.

Keywords. Sun, solar ﬂares, magnetic reconnection, MHD-simulation.

1. Introduction

The phenomenon of MR: a process where MFLs rearrange while magnetic energy
gets converted into heat and kinetic energy of the plasma, is believed to initiate ﬂares
and CMEs. Occurrence of MRs strongly depends on the MFL topology and hence it is
imperative to explore their interdependence, the focus of the paper. For the purpose, we
select the well documented active region NOAA 11158 and extrapolate MFLs by using
magnetograms from HMI/SDO at 01:12 UT on 15th February, 2011, which is roughly
half an hour before the peak of an X2.2 class ﬂare (1:45 UT) followed by an earth-
directed CME. The coronal MFLs are constructed by NFFF extrapolation technique
(Hu et al. 2008), resolving a physical domain of extents ≈ 268 × 134 × 134 (in Mm) by
a computational domain having 128 × 64 × 64 grids in the x, y and z respectively. The
normalized deviation of the extrapolated ﬁeld at the photosphere from its magnetogram
value: En=0.227; which renders the extrapolation reasonably accurate. Figure (1) overlay
extrapolated MFLs on the AR image in 94 ˚A channel. Evident is the overall good match
between the MFLs and the coronal loops. Importantly, Quasi Separatrix Layers (QSLs)
regions having large gradient of MFL connectivity are potential sites for MRs (D´emoulin
2006). QSLs are also found to be present whereas magnetic ﬂux ropes are completely
absent. The presence of QSLs are further conﬁrmed by large values of the squashing factor
(not shown). To explore such MRs, MHD simulations are performed using the parallelized

2. Simulation results

The plasma is idealized as incompressible, viscous, thermally homogeneous and having
perfect electrical conductivity. The MRs, here, are simulated in the sense of Implicit Large
Eddy Simulations; induced by a residual dissipation which is generated when scales get
under-resolved. The panel (a) Figure (2) plots a MFL system having QSLs marked by
bifurcating ﬁeld lines. Subsequent evolution of the MFLs are documented in the panels
(a) to (b). The MFLs are readily seen to shift their footpoint connectivity from the
left of the major bifurcation to its right evident by a temporal increase in number of
MFLs on the right. Such slipping reconnections are known to onset blowout jets, which
are observed in the collocated region and corroborates to the eﬃcacy of the simulation.
However, the post-ﬂare CME indicates the possible presence of a ﬂux-rope which, are
not captured at the simulation and is left as a future work.
