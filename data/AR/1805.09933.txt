(Dated: July 18, 2021)

We present time-resolved measurements of ion heating due to collisional plasma shocks and in-
terpenetrating supersonic plasma ﬂows, which are formed by the oblique merging of two coaxial-
gun-formed plasma jets. Our study was repeated using four jet species: N, Ar, Kr, and Xe. In
conditions with small interpenetration between jets, the observed peak ion temperature Ti is con-
sistent with the predictions of collisional plasma-shock theory, showing a substantial elevation of
Ti above the electron temperature Te and also the subsequent decrease of Ti on the classical ion–
electron temperature-equilibration time scale. In conditions of signiﬁcant interpenetration between
jets, such that shocks do not apparently form, the observed peak Ti is still appreciable and greater
than Te, but much lower than that predicted by collisional plasma-shock theory. Experimental
results are compared with multi-ﬂuid plasma simulations.

Shocks are a fundamental feature of supersonic plasma
ﬂows and aﬀect the energy balance and dynamical evo-
lution of physical systems in which the shocks are em-
bedded, e.g., in astrophysical systems [1–4] or in high-
energy-density (HED) [5] and inertial-conﬁnement-fusion
(ICF) [6] experiments. Diﬀering in two key respects from
hydrodynamic shocks, plasma shocks (1) are mediated
either by classical Coulomb collisions between plasma
particles (collisional plasma shock [7, 8]) or by collec-
tive eﬀects such as the Weibel instability [9–11] (colli-
sionless plasma shock [12]), and (2) are more complex
due to the coupled interactions of electrons, ions (some-
times multiple species), electromagnetic ﬁelds, and ra-
diative and equation-of-state (EOS) eﬀects. This Let-
ter focuses on ion heating in unmagnetized collisional
plasma shocks and interpenetrating supersonic plasma
ﬂows, where radiative/thermal losses and EOS eﬀects are
important. Related recent experiments include colliding
railgun plasma jets [13–15], wire-array Z pinches [16–18],
and laser ablation of solid targets [19]. The latter is also
used to study collisionless shocks [20–24]. The study of
interpenetrating, colliding plasma ﬂows has a long his-
tory, e.g., [25–27]. Time-resolved ion-temperature data
were not reported in nor were the focus of the prior works.

This Letter presents the ﬁrst detailed diagnostic study
of the time evolution of ion temperature Ti and ion
heating due to unmagnetized collisional plasma shocks
and interpenetrating supersonic plasma ﬂows, with suf-
ﬁcient detail to compare with theory and simulation
across species and collisionality regimes. These new fun-
damental data are valuable for validating and improv-
ing ﬁrst-principles modeling of these phenomena, e.g.,
[28–30], which are crucial for advancements in modeling
HED/ICF experiments and a range of astrophysical plas-
mas. There are signiﬁcant disagreements among diﬀerent
codes and models [31, 32], possibly due to speciﬁc choices
of collisionality, transport, and EOS models and/or their

implementations. Although HED/ICF experiments have
diﬀerent absolute plasma parameters, our experiments
are in a similar regime with respect to collisionality and
EOS, such that the same models and codes are applica-
ble.

Results presented here were obtained on and motivated
by the Plasma Liner Experiment (PLX) [33, 34], where
six coaxial plasma guns [34, 35] are mounted on a 2.74-
m-diameter spherical vacuum chamber. In these experi-
ments, two plasma jets are ﬁred with merging half-angle
θ = 11.6◦ or 20.5◦, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b),
respectively. At the gun nozzle, each jet has ion den-
sity ni ∼ 2 × 1016 cm−3, electron temperature Te ≈
Ti ≈ 1.5 eV, mean-charge ¯Z ≈ 1, diameter ≈ 8.5 cm,
and speed vjet ≈ 25–80 km/s [34]. Details of the gun
design and jet characterization are reported elsewhere
[34, 35]. Extensive prior work [13, 14, 36] showed that a
jet propagating over ∼ 1 m expands radially and axially
at approximately the internal sound speed Cs, Te and vjet
stay approximately constant, ni decreases consistent with
mass conservation, magnetic ﬁeld strength decays by 1/e
every few µs such that both the thermal pressure and
kinetic energy density (of the jet directed motion) dom-
inate over the magnetic pressure when the jets merge,
and that density jumps and jet-merging morphology are
consistent with oblique collisional shock formation.

The plasma parameters reported in this work, i.e., Ti,
Te, electron density ne, ¯Z, and vjet, are inferred from
diagnostic measurements (positions shown in Fig. 1).
Plasma Ti is measured via Doppler broadening of plasma
ion line emission using a high-resolution, 4-m McPher-
son monochromator (2062DP) with a 2400 mm−1 grating
and an intensiﬁed charge-coupled-device (ICCD) detec-
tor. The spectral resolution is 1.5 pm/pixel at the typical
visible wavelengths of interest, suﬃcient to resolve Ti >∼
a few eV for Xe and correspondingly smaller values for
lighter species. The high-resolution spectrometer records

1579, θ = 20.5◦), as measured by interferometry [green dots
in Fig. 1(b)], where r < 0 is below the midplane and error
bars indicate ±1σ of shot-to-shot variation. (b) Example vis-
ible spectral emission from merged plasma jets (shot 1579,

[34], obtained along the same chord positions to atomic
modeling, using the inferred ne from interferometry. Jet
speeds are measured via a photodiode array at the end
of each gun [34]. An ICCD camera (PCO dicam pro) ob-
tains visible-light images of the shock formation or jet in-
terpenetration. Further details of the PLX facility, coax-
ial plasma guns, diagnostics, and plasma-jet parameters
are described in Ref. 34.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show fast-camera images of two
jets merging with θ = 11.6◦ and 20.5◦, respectively, and
Fig. 1(c) shows lineouts of the square root of intensity
across the region of jet merging.
If Te is nearly spa-
tially uniform, which is consistent with both collisional
plasma-shock theory [8] and our experimental measure-
ments, then the lineouts in Fig. 1(c) are representative
of the ni proﬁle. For the black curve, the gradient scale
length ∼ few cm is consistent with expected oblique col-
lisional plasma-shock thicknesses (discussed later).

Figure 2(a) shows representative interferometry pro-
ﬁles of line-integrated ne in the post-merged plasma.
These measurements show small spatial variations in
the post-merge region and are used to infer post-merge
ne. Figure 2(b) shows the broadband emission spectrum
compared to PrismSPECT modeling [38], which we use
to bound Te and ¯Z. The uncertainties in Te and ¯Z are
determined based on the absence/presence of lines com-
pared to PrismSPECT modeling [36]. Post-merge values
of ne, Te, and ¯Z, are summarized in Table I. Broadband
spectra reveal that no impurity lines are observed during
the ﬁrst 10 µs of jet merging; results in Table I are not
expected to be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by impurities.

intensity, false color) of two merging Ar plasma jets (black
arrows indicate direction of travel) with (a) θ = 11.6◦ (shot

plasma shocks, and (b) θ = 20.5◦ (shot 1570, t = 36 µs), show-
ing Ar jet–jet interpenetration (large region of diﬀuse emis-
sion) without apparent shock formation. Diagnostic chord
positions (green and blue dots) and target-chamber center
(TCC) are shown. (c) Lineouts of the square root of intensity
correspond to the magenta dotted lines in (a) and (b).

two chords at a time with typical waist diameter of 2 cm;
chord positions are indicated by the blue dots (10-cm
separation) in Fig. 1. Doppler broadening is the primary
source of line broadening in our parameter regime (the
density is too low for Stark broadening to be apprecia-
ble), and the eﬀects of diﬀering Doppler shifts of diﬀer-
ent jets are minimized by viewing the merging at ≈ 90◦
relative to the directions of jet propagation. Turbulent
motion of the merged plasma is not indicated in the ex-
perimental images. Line-integrated measurements of ne
are obtained using a multi-chord laser interferometer [37].
The density of the post-shock or jet-interpenetration re-
gions are measured using ﬁve interferometry chords (0.3-
cm chord diameter and 1.5-cm spacing between chords)
30 cm from target-chamber center (TCC), as shown by
the green dots in Fig. 1. Plasma Te and ¯Z are bounded
[36] by comparing broadband visible spectroscopy data

TABLE I. Summary of experimental parameters. The ne, Ti, Te, ¯Z, and ion–ion mean free path λi are average, post-merge
values. The jet–jet interpenetration length Lii,s [see Eq. (1)], counter-streaming speed v = 2vjet sin θ, and jet Mach number
M = v/[γk(Ti + ¯ZTe)/mi]1/2 are average, pre-merge values. The average Lii,s and λi values are not intended to be precise but
to provide insight into the collisionality regime. The error ranges for vjet, v, ne, and Ti are ±1σ of the variation over multiple
shots; those for Te and ¯Z represent uncertainties based on comparisons with PrismSPECT spectral modeling.

emission lines used were 463.0-nm N ii, 480.6-nm Ar ii,
473.9-nm Kr ii, and 529.2-nm Xe ii.
In obtaining this
dataset at the positions indicated by the blue dots in
Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), we recorded progressively later times
as we moved the spectrometer viewing chords closer to
TCC (over multiple shots) because the jets and merged
plasma move from right to left in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b).
All recorded data meeting the goodness-of-ﬁt criterion
are included in Fig. 4.

We consider the approximate interpenetration distance
Lii,s between merging jets, which can vary from much
smaller (“collisional”) to of the order or greater (“inter-
penetrating”) than the characteristic jet size L ∼ 20 cm.
Using average pre-merge jet parameters (vjet from pho-
todiodes, ni decreased from measured post-merge ni =
ne/ ¯Z by a factor of 2.5 for interpenetrating cases and
3.5 for shock-forming cases, which are approximations
between theoretical limits of 2 and 4, respectively, for
γ = 5/3, and ¯Z inferred from spectroscopy), we estimate

where v = 2vjet sin θ (cm/s) is the counter-streaming
speed between the two jets, νii,s the counter-streaming
ion–ion slowing frequency in the fast limit (≫ νie,s for
our parameters), Λii the Coulomb logarithm for counter-
streaming ions in the presence of warm electrons [14, 39],
µ the ion/proton mass ratio, ǫ (eV) the energy associated
with v, and the factor of 4 in the denominator accounts
for the integral eﬀect of slowing down [40]. For cases (a)–
(c) and (g) of Table I, L ≫ Lii,s. For cases (d)–(f) and
(h) of Table I, L <∼ Lii,s ∼ vǫ3/2 ∼ v4.

If Lii,s ≪ L, the jets impact each other like pistons,
and collisional plasma shocks typically form [13, 14]. An
upper bound for the jump in Ti across the shock, assum-

volution of instrumental broadening with a Gaussian function
(shot 1601, t = 32 µs, 1-µs gate, θ = 11.6◦, Ar ii 480.6-nm
line, 30 cm from TCC, ﬁtting error = ±0.3 eV).

The primary result of this work is the measurement of
the time evolution of Ti inferred from Doppler broadening
of ionized emission lines, in the post-shock plasma or the
region of jet–jet interpenetration as shown in Figs. 1(a)
and 1(b), respectively. An example of the inference of
Ti from Doppler spectroscopy data is shown in Fig. 3.
Data at the earliest stage of jet merging show evidence of
multiple overlapping line shapes (not shown here), which
we believe to be due to interpenetration and systematic
gun-angle-dependent Doppler shifts. These features are
not observed several µs later into the jet merging.
In
data processing, we reject multiple-line-shape cases and
include only the cases that satisfy a threshold goodness-
of-ﬁt to a single Gaussian.

Figure 4 shows inferred Ti versus time corresponding
to cases (a)–(h) of Table I. Cases (a)–(c) and (g) are
expected to be “collisional” with oblique shock forma-
tion [e.g., Fig. 1(a)], while cases (d)–(f) and (h) are ex-
pected to be “interpenetrating” without apparent shock
formation [e.g., Fig. 1(b)]. “Collisional” and “interpen-
etrating” are deﬁned in the next paragraph. Speciﬁc

Error bars indicate ±1σ variation across ≈ 5 shots per data
point (where available). Horizontal dotted lines denote peak
Ti based on Eq. (2). Dotted lines overlaying the data are
ion–electron temperature relaxation based on Eq. (3). Stars
indicate peak Ti from 1D-equivalent multi-ﬂuid simulations
(see text; star positions are not intended to reﬂect the simu-
lation time). The Te <∼ 3 eV in all cases (see Table I).

is plotted in Fig. 4, overlaying the data. Agreement be-
tween the data and Eq. (3) is generally good. Discrep-
ancies beyond the error bars motivate further detailed
comparisons with theory/modeling, e.g., accounting for
multi-dimensional, radiative, and EOS eﬀects.

Finally, we perform 1D (counter-streaming compo-
nent), multi-ﬂuid calculations (Lagrangian particles ad-
vect electron- and two ion-ﬂuid quantities),
including
thermal/radiative losses and tabular EOS, of peak Ti
(stars in Fig. 4) using the Chicago code [43, 44]. For
collisional cases [Figs. 4(a)–(c) and (g)], calculated peak
Ti are lower than Eq. (2) (expected with inclusion of ther-
mal/radiative losses) but are also somewhat lower than
the data. For interpenetrating cases [Figs. 4(d)–(f) and
(h)], the calculated peak Ti agree reasonably well with
the data. Remaining discrepancies motivate detailed,
multi-dimensional validation studies beyond the scope of
this work.

In conclusion, we report a comprehensive experimen-
tal study of ion heating in collisional plasma shocks and
interpenetrating supersonic plasma ﬂows formed by the
oblique merging of two laboratory plasma jets. The post-
merge Ti ≫ Te in all cases investigated, including for
both very small and substantial jet interpenetration, in-
dicating that the predominant heating goes to the ions
for both cases. For cases with shock formation, the mea-
sured peak Ti agrees in most cases with the theoreti-
cally predicted Ti jump for a collisional plasma shock
[Eq. (2)]. For interpenetrating cases, the measured peak
Ti, unsurprisingly, is substantially below that predicted
by collisional plasma-shock theory. The predicted classi-
cal ion–electron temperature relaxation compares reason-
ably well with the observed Ti decay. Multi-ﬂuid Chicago
simulations show some agreement with the peak-Ti data
in both shock-forming and interpenetrating cases; the
diﬀerences highlight an opportunity for detailed, multi-
dimensional model validation for this and other codes
being used to design and advance our understanding of
HED and ICF experiments.
