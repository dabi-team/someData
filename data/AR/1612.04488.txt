Abstract

An iterative scheme can be used to ﬁnd a steady-state solution to the Boltzmann equation, however,
it is very slow to converge in the near-continuum ﬂow regime. In this paper, a synthetic iterative
scheme is developed to speed up the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation, by penalizing the
collision operator L into the form L = (L + N δh) − N δh, where δ is the gas rarefaction parameter,
h is the velocity distribution function, and N is a tuning parameter controlling the convergence
rate. The velocity distribution function is ﬁrst solved by the conventional iterative scheme, then
it is corrected such that the macroscopic ﬂow velocity is governed by a diﬀusion equation which is
asymptotic-preserving in the Navier-Stokes limit. The eﬃciency of the new scheme is veriﬁed by
calculating the eigenvalue of the iteration, as well as solving for Poiseuille and thermal transpiration
ﬂows. We ﬁnd that the fastest convergence of our synthetic scheme for the linearized Boltzmann
equation is achieved when N δ is close to the average collision frequency. The synthetic iterative
scheme is signiﬁcantly faster than the conventional iterative scheme in both the transition and
the near-continuum ﬂow regimes. Moreover, due to the asymptotic-preserving properties, the SIS
needs less spatial resolution in the near-continuum ﬂow regimes, which makes it even faster than
the conventional iterative scheme. Using this synthetic iterative scheme, and the fast spectral
approximation of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator, Poiseuille and thermal transpiration
ﬂows between two parallel plates, through channels of circular/rectangular cross sections, and
various porous media are calculated over the whole range of gas rarefaction. Finally, the ﬂow of a
Ne-Ar gas mixture is solved based on the linearized Boltzmann equation with the Lennard-Jones
potential for the ﬁrst time, and the diﬀerence between these results and those using hard-sphere
intermolecular potential is discussed.

1. Introduction

The Boltzmann equation is fundamental to a broad range of applications from aerodynamics to
microﬂuidics [1], and it is important to be able to solve it accurately and eﬃciently. Usually, the
Boltzmann equation is solved by the stochastic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique,
which uses a limited number of simulated particles to mimic the binary collisions and streaming of

very large numbers of gas molecules [2]. In DSMC, the length of the spatial cell and the time step
are required to be smaller than the local molecular mean free path and the mean collision time,
respectively, and for this reason this technique becomes very slow and costly for near-continuum
ﬂows. Although time-relaxed and asymptotic-preserving Monte Carlo methods allow large time
steps [3, 4], the restriction on the size of the spatial cells has not yet been removed. The same
problem, in fact, exists in deterministic numerical methods for the Boltzmann equation, where the
streaming and collisions are treated separately in the splitting scheme [5, 6].

The uniﬁed gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) provides an alternative approach. It was ﬁrst developed
for the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) kinetic model [7, 8], then for the Shakhov model [9, 10], and
ﬁnally generalized to the Boltzmann equation [11]. It handles the streaming and binary collisions
simultaneously, so that for time-dependent problems, the time step is only limited by the Courant-
Friedrichs-Lewy condition. Also, the UGKS retains the asymptotic-preserving property in the
Navier-Stokes limit [12], so that the length of the spatial cells can be signiﬁcantly larger than the
molecular mean free path. Moreover, the UGKS is a ﬁnite volume method, and the analytical
integral solution of the BGK-type model enables accurate ﬂux evaluation at the cell interface, so
that the essential ﬂow physics can be captured with coarse grids [13]. These advanced properties
make the UGKS a multiscale method for eﬃcient and accurate calculations of rareﬁed gas ﬂows
over a wide range of the gas rarefaction. Recently, an implicit UGKS has been proposed which
eliminates the time step limitation and further improves the numerical eﬃciency [14].

To ﬁnd a steady-state solution to the Boltzmann equation, an iterative scheme is often adopted.
In the free-molecular ﬂow regime where binary collisions are negligible, the iterative scheme is
eﬃcient. This is because the gas molecules move in straight way so that any disturbance in one
point can be quickly felt by all other points. However, for near-continuum ﬂows the iterations slowly
converge and the results are very likely to be biased by the accumulated rounding errors. Although
the time and spatial steps can be large, the UGKS still needs a large number of iterations [14]. This
is governed by the underlying physics: the exchange of information through streaming becomes very
ineﬃcient when the binary collisions dominate. Therefore, it would be useful to develop an eﬃcient
numerical scheme to solve the Boltzmann equation that has the asymptotic-preserving property in
the Navier-Stokes limit and converges to the steady-state rapidly.

Inspired by work on fast iterative methods for radiation transport processes [15], accelerated
iterative schemes have been developed for the linearized BGK and Shahkov models [16] to overcome
slow convergence in the near-continuum ﬂow regime. The fast iterative scheme is called a synthetic
iterative scheme (SIS) since kinetic model equations are solved in parallel with diﬀusion equations
for macroscopic quantities such as the ﬂow velocity and heat ﬂux. The SIS has been successfully
applied to Poiseuille ﬂow in channels with two-dimensional cross sections of arbitrary shapes [17]
using a BGK model for single-species gases, and ﬂows of binary and ternary gas mixtures driven
by the local pressure, temperature, and concentration gradients [17, 18, 19] using the McCormack
model [20]. The fast convergence of the SIS is due to three factors: ﬁrst, the macroscopic synthetic
diﬀusion equations exchange the information very eﬃciently; second, the macroscopic ﬂow quanti-
ties can be fed back into mesoscopic kinetic models; and third, macroscopic diﬀusion equations are
solved more quickly than mesoscopic kinetic model equations.

In the present paper we aim to develop a SIS to solve the linearized Boltzmann equation
(LBE) for Poiseuille and thermal transpiration ﬂows. Although for the single-species LBE these
canonical ﬂows have been extensively studied for hard-sphere [21, 22], inverse power-law [23], and
even Lennard-Jones [24, 25] potentials, the numerical results for near-continuum ﬂows are scarce.
Moreover, for gas mixtures these ﬂows have only been solved based on the hard-sphere model

2

in a one-dimensional geometry [26]. We will calculate these ﬂows through two-dimensional cross
sections of arbitrary shape and investigate the inﬂuence of realistic intermolecular potentials for
gas mixtures.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. 2, we brieﬂy introduce the LBE for
single-species gases and the conventional iterative scheme. Then by analyzing the SIS for the BGK
model, we develop a SIS for the LBE and test its performance by calculating the eigenvalues of
iterations and Poiseuille/thermal transpiration ﬂows. We improve the eﬃciency of the proposed SIS
by adjusting a parameter in the scheme, which can be determined prior to the numerical simulation.
In Sec. 3, the SIS is applied to solve the rareﬁed gas ﬂows in multiscale problems. In Sec. 4, the SIS
in the polar coordinates is proposed and numerical results of the LBE for Poiseuille ﬂow through a
tube are presented. In Sec. 5, the SIS is extended to the LBE for gas mixtures, and Poiseuille ﬂow
of a Ne-Ar mixture is solved for the ﬁrst time based on the Lennard-Jones potential. In Sec. 6, we
conclude with a summary of the proposed numerical method and future perspectives.

2. A synthetic scheme for the single-species LBE

Consider the steady ﬂow of a single-species monatomic gas through a channel of arbitrary cross
section in the x1-x2 plane, subject to small pressure/temperature gradients in the x3 direction. The
velocity distribution function (VDF) can be expressed as f = feq + h, where

feq(v) =

exp(−|v|2)
π3/2

(1)

is the equilibrium VDF and h(x1, x2, v) is the deviated VDF satisfying |h/feq| (cid:28) 1. The LBE for
h reads:

= L(h, feq) + S,

with the linearized Boltzmann collision operator [23]:

In Eqs. (2) and (3), x = (x1, x2, x3) is the position vector normalized by the characteristic ﬂow
length (cid:96), v = (v1, v2, v3) is the molecular velocity vector normalized by the most probable speed
vm = (cid:112)2kBT0/m (kB is the Boltzmann constant, T0 is the gas/wall temperature, and m is the gas
molecular mass), B(|v−v∗|, θ) is the collision kernel determined by the intermolecular potential [23,

macroscopic quantities are proportional to XP and XT , we assume XP = XT = −1.

The integro-diﬀerential system deﬁned by Eqs. (2) and (3) is usually solved by the conventional
iterative scheme (CIS). Given the value of h(k) at the k-th iteration step, the VDF at the next
iteration step is calculated by solving the following equation:

νeqh(k+1) + v1

∂h(k+1)
∂x1

+ v2

∂h(k+1)
∂x2

= L+(h(k), feq) + S,

(10)

where derivatives with respect to spatial variables are usually approximated by a second-order up-
wind ﬁnite diﬀerence. The process is repeated until relative diﬀerences between successive estimates
of macroscopic quantities are less than a convergence criterion (cid:15). The number of iteration steps
in CIS increases signiﬁcantly when the ratio of the molecular mean free path to the characteristic
ﬂow length decreases, especially when the ﬂow is in the near-continuum regime [16]. It is our goal
here to develop a fast iterative scheme to solve the LBE eﬃciently over the whole range of gas
rarefaction.

2.1. SIS for the BGK equation

To begin with, we introduce the SIS for the BGK equation [16]. The linearized Boltzmann
collision operator in Eq. (3) is replaced by that of the BGK kinetic model, yielding the following
equation for the deviated VDF h:

Multiplying Eq. (11) by the Hermite polynomials and applying the recursion relation, a set
of ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equations can be obtained for various moments [27]. Here, two

Note that in obtaining the ﬁnal equation, we have used the relation ∂P13/∂x1 + ∂P23/∂x2 = 1 for
Poiseuille ﬂow and ∂P13/∂x1 + ∂P23/∂x2 = 0 for thermal transpiration ﬂow. The SIS for the BGK
equation then works as follows [16, 27]:

• When h(k) and U (k)

the following equation:

near the boundary. However, for the ﬂow
is obtained

The above iterative procedure is continued until convergence. It should be emphasized that the
relation ∂P13/∂x1 + ∂P23/∂x2 = 1 or 0 for Poiseuille ﬂow or thermal transpiration ﬂow respectively
is crucial for the fast convergence of the SIS. This is because non-accelerated moments are negligible
at large values of the rarefaction parameter δ, so the synthetic equation (16b) quickly adjusts the
ﬂow velocity to the solution of the Stokes equation, which is close to the solution of the linearized
BGK equation. If the synthetic equation (16a) is used instead, with P13 and P23 calculated based
upon the VDF obtained at each iteration step, the slow convergence at large values of δ is not
improved, because it takes a lot of iterations to reach the condition ∂P13/∂x1 + ∂P23/∂x2 = 1 or 0;
in the worst-case scenario, it may even lead to false convergence and wrong solutions when the
spatial resolution is not high enough. However, Eq. (16b) guarantees the correctness of the solution
at large values of δ, as it has the asymptotic-preserving property in the Navier-Stokes limit [12].

2.2. SIS for the LBE

The development of a SIS for the LBE is not straightforward, since the linearized Boltzmann
collision operator is much more complicated than that of the linearized BGK model. Directly
following the method in Sec. 2.1, the following diﬀusion equation for the ﬂow velocity is obtained:

(18)

which, like Eq. (16a), cannot improve the slow convergence at large values of δ.

To speed up the convergence, the relation ∂P13/∂x1 + ∂P23/∂x2 = 1 or 0 for Poiseuille ﬂow or
thermal transpiration ﬂow respectively must be reﬂected in the diﬀusion equation. For instance, as
in Eq. (16b), a term similar to −δ should appear on the right-hand-side of Eq. (18) for Poiseuille
ﬂow. To achieve this, we penalize the Boltzmann collision operator by the BGK operator [6], i.e.,

and let

which is very close to Eq. (16b) for the linearized BGK equation. At large values of the rarefaction
parameter δ, (cid:82) (L−LBGK)v1v3dv and (cid:82) (L−LBGK)v2v3dv approach zero, and Eq. (21) possesses the
asymptotic-preserving property in the Navier-Stokes limit [12]. Therefore, a SIS can be developed
based on this equation. Note that for thermal transpiration ﬂow, δ in Eq. (21) should be replaced
by zero as ∂P13/∂x1 + ∂P23/∂x2 = 0.

The SIS for the LBE then works as that for the BGK equations, with some slight changes:

• When h(k) and U (k)

are known at the k-th iteration step, we calculate (cid:82) v1v3(L−LBGK)dv and
(cid:82) v2v3(L − LBGK)dv. We also calculate the VDF h(k+1/2) by solving the following equation:

• From h(k+1/2), we calculate the ﬂow velocity U (k+1/2), and the non-accelerated moments

F2,0,1, F1,1,1, and F0,2,1.

• Near the boundary, we let U (k+1)

Figure 1: Eigenvalue ω versus the rarefaction parameter δ for the iterative scheme for the LBE with Maxwell and
hard-sphere molecules (Note that Poiseuille and thermal transpiration ﬂows have the same eigenvalue). Note that
our method to calculate the eigenvalue for the SIS at large values of δ is not accurate, since the convergence is fast
(it converges after one iteration) and we therefore have few data to ﬁnd λ through numerical ﬁtting. However, the
trend that ω for the SIS decreases with 1/δ as 1/δ → 0 is clear.

• The above steps are repeated until convergence.

Note that for the linearized BGK model [16], Eq. (23) is not necessary because the linearized
collision operator at the next iterative step automatically changes when the ﬂow velocity is corrected
by the diﬀusion equation. In the LBE, however, the change of ﬂow velocity does not directly change
the collision operator at the next iterative step, so Eq. (23) is important.

2.3. Numerical analysis of the convergence rate

Analytical solutions for the eigenvalue ω are introduced in order to characterize the convergence
rate of the iterative scheme for the linearized BGK equation [16, 27]. However, this is more diﬃcult
for the LBE because of its intricate collision operator. Here we calculate the eigenvalue numerically
in order to study the performance of both the SIS and the CIS. For simplicity, we consider a periodic
system of length (cid:96) in the x1 direction, while the system is homogeneous in the x2 direction.

For the CIS (10), the VDF is solved in the following manner (hereafter in this section, h and

U3 should be viewed as their Fourier transforms in the x1 direction):

calculated as ω = e−λ. It is obvious that the smaller ω is, the faster the convergence, and the case
of ω = 1 means no convergence.

Figure 1 presents the eigenvalues for both the SIS and the CIS. For small values of the rarefaction
parameter δ, both schemes have the same convergence rate. However, for large values of δ, the CIS
has extremely slow convergence (ω ≈ 1), while the SIS converges much faster. It is also interesting
to note that the intermolecular potential greatly aﬀects the convergence rate: at the same value
of δ, the solution of the LBE for hard-sphere molecules converges faster than that for Maxwell
molecules1, in both the SIS and the CIS.

2.4. Numerical results for spatially-inhomogeneous systems

We now perform numerical simulations to demonstrate the eﬃciency and accuracy of the SIS
for Poiseuille/thermal transpiration ﬂows between inﬁnite parallel plates and then through a two-
dimensional square channel.

We ﬁrst consider a gas ﬂow between two inﬁnite parallel plates located at x1 = −1/2 and
x1 = 1/2 (note that x1 has been normalized by the distance between two parallel palates (cid:96)). Pressure
and temperature gradients are applied in the x3 direction only, so the ﬂow is homogeneous in the x2
direction and partial derivatives with respect to x2 can be dropped. The discretization of the three-
dimensional molecular velocity space, as well as the fast spectral approximation of the linearized
Boltzmann collision operator, are given in Ref. [23]. We adopt the diﬀuse boundary condition
for the gas-wall interaction. Due to symmetry, only half of the spatial region (−1/2 ≤ x1 ≤ 0)
is simulated, with a specular-reﬂection boundary condition at x1 = 0, and the diﬀuse boundary
condition h(v2 > 0) = 0 at x1 = −1/2. The spatial domain is divided into 100 nonuniform
sections, with most of the discrete points placed near the wall: x1 = (10 − 15s + 6s2)s3 − 0.5, where
s = (0, 1, · · · , Ns)/2Ns. The size of the smallest section is 1.24 × 10−6, small enough to capture the
Knudsen layer.

For the one-dimensional problem, the shear stress is P13 = x1 for Poiseuille ﬂow and P13 = 0 for
thermal transpiration ﬂow. The diﬀusion equation (21) is integrated to give the following ﬁrst-order
ordinary diﬀerential equation:

(M = 2 (cid:82) 0
−1/2 q3dx1) between two consecutive iterations are less than (cid:15) = 10−10.
A comparison between the SIS and the CIS is tabulated in Table 1 for Poiseuille ﬂow. The
relative diﬀerences in mass/heat ﬂow rates between the two schemes is within 0.5%, which demon-
strates the accuracy of the SIS. The superiority of the SIS over the CIS is immediately seen: for the
CIS, the number of iteration steps increase rapidly with the rarefaction parameter, while for the
SIS it only slightly increases with δ in the free-molecular and transition ﬂow regimes and saturates
in the near-continuum ﬂow regime (δ ≥ 10). Since, compared to the fast spectral approximation of
the Boltzmann collision operator the time for solving Eq. (27) is negligible, the CPU time saving
is proportional to the time-step saving, and this is tremendous for the SIS. At δ = 10, the SIS is
about 15 times faster than the CIS, while at δ = 50 it is about 220 times faster.

It is interesting to note that for both the SIS and CIS, solutions of the LBE for hard-sphere
molecules converge about 1.5 times faster than that for Maxwell molecules, a result which supports
the convergence analysis in Sec. 2.3.

We also consider Poiseuille/thermal transpiration ﬂows along a channel of square cross section.
Due to symmetry, only one quarter of the spatial domain is simulated, which is divided into 50 × 50
non-uniform cells: in each direction, from the boundary to the center, the length of each cell side
forms a geometric progression with a common ratio 1.05. The diﬀusion equation (21) is discretized
by a ﬁve-point central diﬀerence, and solved by the successive-over-relaxation method [28]. Table 2
summarizes the numerical results from the SIS. The mass ﬂow rate of thermal transpiration ﬂow
is not shown, as according to the Onsager-Casimir relation it is equal to the heat ﬂow rate of
Poiseuille ﬂow. From this table it is seen that our SIS for the LBE works eﬃciently over the whole
range of gas rarefaction.

2.5. The most eﬃcient scheme

In Sec. 2.4 we saw that the SIS for the LBE can be faster than the CIS by several orders
of magnitude in the near-continuum regime. Now we look at the possibility of speeding up the

convergence even further, without modifying the scheme too much. To this end, we rewrite the
linearized Boltzmann collision operator in the following form:

L = (L − N LBGK) + N LBGK,

(28)

where the constant N is a tuning parameter which aﬀects the convergence rate.

With Eq. (19) replaced by Eq. (28), the diﬀusion equation (21) should be changed accordingly.
Our numerical results for Poiseuille ﬂow between two parallel plates show that, for a ﬁxed δ, all
synthetic schemes with diﬀerent values of N converge to the same solution (with relative errors
in ﬂow rates less than 0.1%). However, the convergence rate varies with N . From the top row
in Fig. 2 we see that in the free molecular regime all schemes have the same convergence rate,
while in the transition regime the scheme with N < 1 (N > 1) converges slower (faster) than that
with N = 1. The situation becomes complicated in the near-continuum regime: for hard-sphere
molecules, the case with N = 1.5 converges fastest, followed by N = 1, 2, and 0.5. For Maxwell
molecules, however, the cases with N = 1.5 and N = 2 have roughly the same fast convergence,
followed by N = 1 and 0.5. Similar behaviors are observed for the thermal transpiration ﬂow.

To further investigate the relationship between the convergence iteration step and N in the
synthetic scheme, we ﬁx δ = 100 and vary N . The numerical results in the bottom row of Fig. 2
show that the fastest convergence is achieved when N is approximately 2 or 1.5 for Maxwell or hard-
sphere molecules, respectively. This may be interpreted in terms of the average collision frequency.
In the LBE, the equilibrium collision frequency νeq is in general a function of the molecular velocity,
and the average collision frequency,

(cid:90)

¯ν =

νeq(v)feq(v)dv,

(29)

varies between diﬀerent intermolecular potentials even when the shear viscosity is the same. We
found that for Maxwell and hard-sphere molecules, the average collision frequencies are 2.22 and
1.25 times larger than the rarefaction parameter, respectively, which are very close to the two values

2.6. Further beneﬁt of using SIS

In addition to the signiﬁcant speed up of convergence, the SIS can also help to reduce the
spatial resolution. It is well-known that to solve the kinetic equations, the size of the spatial cells
in the traditional discrete velocity method should be smaller than the molecular mean free path2,
so that numerical results are reliable when the artiﬁcial viscosity is much smaller than the physical

2Remarkably, the UGKS does not have this restriction.

viscosity. In the SIS, the macroscopic ﬂow velocity is obtained by solving the diﬀuse equation (21),
so the spatial resolution can be relatively coarser.

To demonstrate this, we run the test case in Sec. 2.4 again, but the half spatial domain is now
divided into 10 uniform cells. Both the accelerated and non-accelerated schemes on this coarse grid
are compared to the “reference” solutions in Table 1. Since the mass ﬂow rate in Poiseuille ﬂow
increases rapidly with δ, we study how the apparent gas permeability change with the rarefaction
parameter. Here, the apparent gas permeability, which is normalized by (cid:96)2, is deﬁned as

κ =

MP
δ

.

(31)

Note that, according to the Navier-Stokes equation with the no-slip velocity boundary condition,
κ = 1/12 when δ → ∞; this permeability is also known as the intrinsic or liquid permeability. The
apparent gas permeability is always larger than the intrinsic permeability, and increases with 1/δ
(or the Knudsen number).

Figure 3 shows the apparent gas permeability obtained at diﬀerent spatial resolution and rar-
efaction parameter. It is clear that the SIS with the coarse spatial resolution can yield good results,
while the non-accelerated iterative scheme has larger errors at large values of δ. For instance, when
δ=150, the non-accelerated scheme underpredicts the apparent gas permeability by about 12.5%.
This error continues to increases with δ: we tested the BGK model when δ = 104 and found that
the relative error is about 62.5%.

3. SIS in multiscale problems

In this section, we investigate the performance of the SIS in more complex geometries, where
the problems are multiscale in the sense that the rarefaction parameter varies by several orders
of magnitude if diﬀerent characteristic size of solids is chosen, especially when the geometry is a
fractal.

3.1. Rareﬁed gas ﬂow through the Sierpinski carpet

diﬀerent levels of recursion, when δ = 1 (top row), 10 (middle row), and 100 (bottom row).

We ﬁrst consider the rareﬁed gas ﬂow through a two-dimensional cross section described by the
Sierpinski carpet, which can be generated through recursion, beginning with a square. The square
is cut into 9 congruent subsquares in a 3 × 3 grid, and the central subsquare is removed. The same

gles, and pentagrams represent the results of the Sierpinski carpets generated at the recursion level 0, 1, 2, and 3,
respectively.

procedure is then applied recursively to the remaining 8 subsquares. Resulting geometries after
several levels of recursion are presented in Fig. 4.

Due to the symmetry, the one quarter of the level 1, 2, and 3 Sierpinski carpets are divided
into 60 × 60, 90 × 90, and 135 × 135 uniform cells, respectively. The molecular velocity space is
represented by 32 × 32 × 12 discrete grids. The iteration number, using N = 1.5 in Eq. (28) for
the hard-sphere gas, is always less than 55 for each rarefaction parameter, when the relative error
in the mass ﬂow rate MP between two consecutive iteration steps is less than 10−5.

Figure 5 displays the contour of ﬂow velocities at diﬀerent geometries and rarefaction param-
eters, where the characteristic ﬂow length (cid:96) is chosen to be the side length of the largest square.
When there is no solid inside the largest square (ﬁrst column in Fig. 5), the maximum velocity is
at the center of the domain. When there are some solids inside the largest square, when δ is small,
it seems that large ﬂow velocities are equally distributed near the central regions. However, when
δ is large, large ﬂow velocities are localized between the smallest squares which are far away from
other larger squares, instead of in the central region of the carpets. This may be seen clearly in the
Sierpinski carpet of level 3 (last column of Fig. 5).

Figure 6 shows the ﬂow rates in the Poiseuille ﬂow of the hard-sphere gas through the Sierpinski
carpet. The Knudsen minimum in the mass ﬂow rate can be seen, however, the location of the
minimum MP shifts towards large values of δ, as the recursion level of the Sierpinski carpet
increases. This is because, in the calculation of δ according to Eq. (12), the characteristic ﬂow
length (cid:96) is chosen to be the side length of the largest square, which is larger than, say, the smallest
side length of the solids near which the ﬂow velocity is maximum. As the recursion level increases,
the porosity (the fraction of the void area) of the Sierpinski carpet decreases, so both the mass
and heat ﬂux ﬂow rates decrease. We also plot in Fig. 6 the thermomolecular pressure diﬀerence
exponent, which is an important parameter determining the performance of Knudsen pump. The
exponent always increases with decreasing δ and approaches the value of 0.5 when δ → 0 when the
diﬀuse gas-surface boundary condition is used [29]. This may also indicate the correctness of our
numerical simulations.

3.2. Rareﬁed gas ﬂow through random structures

We then consider the rareﬁed gas ﬂow through two-dimensional porous media, where the poros-
ity is 0.6. The ﬁrst porous medium is generated by adding circular solids of diﬀerent radius ran-
domly to a square. The radius ratio of the largest disc to the smallest is 10. The square is divided
into 200 × 200 uniform cells, and the discs are approximated by the staircase, as visualized in
Fig. 7(a). The second porous medium, shown in Fig. 7(b), also consisting of 200 × 200 uniform
cells, is generated by the quartet structure generation set [30].

Velocity contours are displayed in Fig. 8 in the free molecular and near-continuum ﬂow regimes,
while the ﬂow rates are shown in Fig. 9. It is interesting to note that, in the free molecular ﬂow
regime, the mass ﬂow rates of the two random porous media are nearly the same. However, in the
near-continuum ﬂow regime, the mass ﬂow rate of the porous medium consisting of random squares
is about twice larger than that of discs.

4. A special case: SIS in the polar coordinate

The SIS developed above for the LBE works well in the Cartesian coordinates, for rareﬁed gas
ﬂows through general cross sections. For a ﬂow through a circular cross section, the use of polar
coordinates will save the computational cost signiﬁcantly.

15

Figure 8: Velocity contours in the Poiseuille ﬂow of the hard-sphere gas through the two random porous media, when
δ = 0.01 (left column) and 300 (right column).

We consider the Poiseuille ﬂow through a tube as an example, where the axis of the tube is
along the x3 direction, and its cross section is located in the x1-x2 plane. The spatial coordinates
are normalized by the radius of the tube. Introduce the transformation x1 = r cos θ, x2 = r sin θ,
v1 = vr cos θ, v2 = vr sin θ, and deﬁne the VDF h = h(r, θ, vr, v3) in the cylindrical coordinates

In the numerical simulation, the spatial coordinate r ∈ (0, 1] is discretized by 150 nonuniform
points, with most of the points located near the surface. Due to the symmetry, the truncated
velocity vr ∈ (0, 4) is discretized by 22 nonuniform points, with most of the points located near

spectrum of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator in the Cartesian coordinate. Finally, the
inverse Fourier transform is used to ﬁnd the collision operator in the cylindrical space. As usual, the
spatial derivatives in the LBE (32) are approximated by the second-order upwind ﬁnite diﬀerence,
and Eq. (37) is solved by the implicit iterative scheme, while the acceleration equation is used to
expedite the convergence to the steady-state solution, which is also solved using the second-order
upwind ﬁnite diﬀerence, from r = 1 to 0. Having obtained U3(r) from Eq. (37), a correction in the
VDF is performed, see Eq. (23).

through two parallel plates and rectangular cross sections, the SIS in the polar coordinates is also
very eﬃcient.

5. SIS for the LBE of gas mixtures

In this section we develop a SIS for the LBE for binary gas mixtures. For simplicity, only
Poiseuille ﬂow is considered, but the method can be generalized to ﬂows driven by temperature
and concentration gradients.

Let fA and fB be, respectively, the VDFs of gas components A and B with molecular mass mA
and mB, and molar fraction χA and χB = 1 − χA. Introducing the equilibrium VDF (in which the
velocity is normalized by the most probable speed vmA = (cid:112)2kBT0/mA of component A [31]):

fα,eq(v) = χα

, α = A or B,

(38)

and expressing the VDF in the form fα = fα,eq + hα, where hα are deviated VDFs satisfying
|hα/fα,eq| (cid:28) 1, the LBE for hα reads

v1

= Lα + Sα,

(39)

with the linearized Boltzmann collision operators Lα = (cid:80)
where the details of Qαβ can be found in Ref. [31]. The source term for Poiseuille ﬂow is

β=1,2 Qαβ(fα,eq, hβ) + Qαβ(hα, fβ,eq),

Sα = −XP v3fα,eq,

(40)

and again we take XP = −1.

When the deviated VDFs are known, the ﬂow velocity normalized by vmA is calculated as Uα =
(cid:82) hαv1v3dv/mA

(cid:82) hαv3dv/χα, shear stresses normalized by the total gas pressure p0 are Pα13 = 2mα
and Pα23 = 2mα
The dimensionless molecular ﬂow rate M and heat ﬂow rate Q, normalized by the most probable
speed of the gas mixture, are calculated as

(cid:82) hαv2v3dv/mA, and the heat ﬂux normalized by p0vmA is qα = (cid:82) (cid:0)mα|v|2/mA − 5/2(cid:1)v3hdv.

5.1. The synthetic scheme for gas mixture

As emphasized in the previous section, the relation ∂P13/∂x1 + ∂P23/∂x2 = 1 is important to
developing the SIS. For binary mixtures, this relation still holds, but now shear stresses are replaced
by mixture shear stresses, i.e. P13 = PA13 + PB13 and P23 = PA23 + PB23. This poses an additional
diﬃculty.

Following the basic steps in developing the synthetic equation, we obtain the following two

equations for the ﬂow velocity of each component:

To obtain diﬀusion equations which recover the Stokes equation (an important step, guaran-
teeing fast convergence) in the hydrodynamic regime, we rewrite the linearized collision operator
as3:

Lα = (Lα + Nαδhα) − Nαδhα,
(43)
where Nα are two constants, and let 2 (cid:82) v1v3Lαdv = (cid:82) v1v3(Lα + Nαδhα)dv − NαδmAPα13/mα and
2 (cid:82) v2v3Lαdv = (cid:82) v2v3(Lα + Nαδhα)dv − NαδmAPα23/mα. Then, for component B, Eq. (42) is

3This is because the linearized Boltzmann collision operator for single-species gases can also be penalized into the
form of L = (L + N δh) − N δh, instead of the form given in Eq. (28). The virtue of Eq. (43) is that the resulting
diﬀusion equations will be very simple (compared to those in Refs. [28, 32] for the McCormack kinetic model), but
without any loss of eﬃciency of the SIS.

We therefore propose the SIS for the LBE for binary gas mixtures: while the VDFs in Eq. (39)
are ﬁrst solved by the CIS [31], ﬂow velocities are updated according to diﬀusion equations (44)
and (45). Then the VDFs are corrected in a way similar to Eq. (23). Note that the fastest
convergence can be achieved when

Nα =

(cid:82) να,eq(v)fα,eq(v)dv

,

(46)

where να,eq is the equilibrium collision frequency of the α-component.

The present SIS is readily generalized to multiple gas mixtures. Suppose there are j gas com-
ponents. For the velocity of the ﬁrst component, the term ∂PB13/∂x1 + ∂PB23/∂x2 in the diﬀusion
equation (45) can be replace by (cid:80)j
i=2(∂Pi13/∂x1 + ∂Pi23/∂x2), while the diﬀusion equations for the
ﬂow velocities of the other components remain the same as Eq. (44), i.e. by replacing B with the

component index i. This method can also be applied to the McCormack kinetic equation [20] for
multiple gas mixtures, by simply replacing Lα in Eqs. (44) and (45) with that in the McCormack
model; the resulting diﬀusion equations will be much simpler than those in Refs. [28, 32].

5.2. Convergence analysis

To show the eﬃciency of the proposed SIS for binary gas mixtures, we calculate the eigenvalue
of the iteration as a function of the rarefaction parameter. The numerical procedure is essentially
the same as that in Sec. 2.3 for single-species gases. Fig. 10 shows the eigenvalue of both the SIS
and CIS for an equimolar Ne-Ar mixture, where Ne and Ar are treated as hard-sphere molecules
with a molecular diameter ratio of 0.711. It is clear that the SIS speeds up the slow convergence
at large values of the rarefaction parameter. Also, when compared to the SIS for a single-species
hard-sphere gas, the synthetic scheme for a binary gas mixture has roughly the same maximum
eigenvalue, i.e. ω (cid:39) 0.6. So it is expected that the synthetic scheme for a binary gas mixture will
be as eﬃcient as that for a single-species gas. It is also interesting to noted that at small values of
δ the eigenvalue of the SIS is slightly higher than that of the CIS; the reason for this is not clear.
However, it will not aﬀect the eﬃciency of the SIS because at small values of δ both the SIS and
CIS converge rapidly, i.e. within a small number of iterations.

ﬂow rate (bottom) proﬁles in the Poiseuille ﬂow of an equimolar Ne-Ar mixture between two parallel plates.

5.3. Numerical simulations of Poiseuille ﬂow

Following the convergence analysis, numerical simulations are now conducted on the Poiseuille
ﬂow of a Ne-Ar mixture between two parallel plates. First, the hard-sphere potential is considered.
Table 4 shows the molecular and heat ﬂow rates of each component over a wide range of gas
rarefaction, when the molar fraction of Ne is 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9. From this table we see that the SIS
is eﬃcient, since convergence is reached within 100 iterations when Nα = 1; when using Nα = 1.5
in Eqs. (44) and (45), converged solutions can be obtained within 50 iterations. Such an eﬃcient
method enables the study of the ﬂow dynamics in the whole range of gas rarefaction.

In the free molecular and transition regimes, the molecular ﬂow rate of the lighter species is
always larger than that of the heavier species, however, in the near-continuum regime the molecular
ﬂow rates are the same for both gas components. When compared to the results in Table 1 we
see that the diﬀerence in the molecular ﬂow rates is within 1% in the near-continuum regime.
A comparison of velocity and heat ﬂux proﬁles in diﬀerent ﬂow regimes is visualized in Fig. 11,
which shows that the diﬀerence between the velocity proﬁle of each component is reduced as the
rarefaction parameter increases. As δ increases, the diﬀerence between the heat ﬂux divided by the
molar fraction of each component also decreases, but in the near-continuum limit the heat ﬂux of
2 times of that of Ar, while the diﬀerence in the molecular ﬂow rate goes to zero.
Ne is roughly
We have also simulated the Ne-Ar mixture ﬂow based on the LBE for Lennard-Jones potentials
for the ﬁrst time, where the fast spectral approximation of the Boltzmann collision operator is
reported in Ref. [25]. The inﬂuence of the molecular model on the velocity and heat ﬂux proﬁles
is shown in Fig. 11: the hard-sphere model overestimates the velocity and heat ﬂux in the free-
molecular regime, but in the transition and near-continuum regimes the diﬀerence between the two

molecular models reduces as δ increases. This is in good agreement with the observations in the
single-species case [24, 25].

Figure 12 shows the molecular and heat ﬂow rates as a function of the rarefaction parameter.
The two ﬂow rates obtained from the LBE with Lennard-Jones potentials is smaller than that
for the hard-sphere model when δ < 1 (i.e. when δ = 0.01, the particle ﬂow rates are about
15% smaller, while the heat ﬂow rates are about 25% smaller). This situation is reversed for the
molecular ﬂow rate, but diﬀerences between the two molecular models are nearly indistinguishable
when δ > 1.

We now calculate the Poiseuille ﬂow of an equimolar Ne-Ar mixture along channels of rectan-
gular cross sections, based on the hard-sphere model. To the best of our knowledge, the LBE for a
gas mixture has never been solved in a two-dimensional geometry before, because of the numerical
complexity, but now the problem is tackled here by the SIS and the fast spectral method [31].
The discretization of the spatial domain of a square cross section is the same as that in Sec. 2.4,
while for a rectangular cross section of aspect ratio 2 the spatial domain is discretized by 50 × 100
cells, and the characteristic length (cid:96) is chosen to be the shorter side. Table 5 summarizes the LBE
solution for the molecular and heat ﬂow rates in two-dimensional Poiseuille ﬂow over a wide range
of the rarefaction parameter for the ﬁrst time. The iterations needed to achieve the convergence
criterion (cid:15) = 10−7 are fewer than 40 when δ ≤ 100, demonstrating the eﬃciency of the SIS. The
normalized molecular ﬂow rates of Ne and Ar through the rectangular cross section with aspect
ratio 2 are always larger than those in the aspect ratio 1 case. However, although the heat ﬂow
rates through the rectangular cross section with an aspect ratio of 2 are larger than those with
the aspect ratio 1 when δ < 20, they become roughly the same when δ ≥ 20. Typical velocity
and heat ﬂux proﬁles of the Ne-Ar mixture through the square cross section in the free molecular,
transition, and near-continuum regimes are shown in Fig. 13, and are also compared to those of
the single-species gas in the same geometry. From this ﬁgure we see that the velocity and heat ﬂux
of Ne is always larger than that of Ar, while the corresponding results for a single-species gas lie
between these of Ne and Ar.

6. Conclusions

We have proposed a synthetic iterative scheme to accelerate the convergence of the linearized
Boltzmann equation for gas ﬂows driven by pressure and temperature gradients in long channels.
By penalizing the linearized Boltzmann collision operator L into the form of L = (L + N LBGK) −
N LBGK or L = (L + N δh) − N δh, a diﬀusion equation has been derived for the macroscopic
ﬂow velocity. The velocity distribution function in the linearized Boltzmann equation was ﬁrst
solved by the conventional iterative scheme, where the linearized Boltzmann collision operator was
approximated by the fast spectral method. Then the ﬂow velocity was obtained by solving the
diﬀusion equation, which was ﬁnally used to correct the velocity distribution function. In this way
the slow convergence of the conventional iterative scheme in the near-continuum ﬂow regime has
been tackled, as we found, through the numerical solution of Poiseuille and thermal transpiration
ﬂows, that the synthetic iterative scheme is faster than the conventional iterative scheme by up to
several orders of magnitude.

While
synthetic iterative schemes for other kinetic model equations (such as the linearized Bhatnagar-
Gross-Krook model and the McCormack model) have been proposed with N = 1, in numerical in-
vestigations we found that for the linearized Boltzmann equation the fastest convergence is achieved
when N roughly equals the ratio of the equilibrium collision frequency to the rarefaction parameter.
Thus, N varies with the intermolecular potential: for a single-species gas, we found that N ≈ 1.5
for the hard-sphere gas model and N ≈ 2 for the Maxwell gas model we used.

We also extended the synthetic iterative scheme to binary gas mixtures, and both the hard-
sphere and Lennard-Jones potentials have been considered. As an example, Poiseuille ﬂow of
a Ne-Ar mixture was simulated in order to test the computational performance as well as the
inﬂuence of the intermolecular potential. The synthetic iterative scheme required only a limited
number of iterations over the whole range of gas rarefaction. Based on this eﬃcient scheme, the
Poiseuille ﬂow of a Ne-Ar mixture between two parallel plates was simulated for the ﬁrst time using
the realistic Lennard-Jones potential. We found that the hard-sphere gas model overestimates the
particle and heat ﬂow rates when δ < 1. Poiseuille ﬂow of a Ne-Ar mixture through two-dimensional
rectangular cross sections was also simulated using the linearized Boltzmann equation for the ﬁrst
time. The molecular and heat ﬂow rates were tabulated, and representative velocity and heat ﬂux
proﬁles were also shown for benchmarking.

The present method can be extended to the eﬃcient calculation of ﬂows of multiple gas mixtures.
In particular, our method can be applied to the McCormack model and we believe that the resulting
diﬀusion equations for the ﬂow velocity of each component will be much simpler than those in
Refs. [17, 18], while diﬀusion equations for the heat ﬂux are not necessary since the linearized
Boltzmann equation converges fast enough without accelerating the convergence of the heat ﬂux.
Our synthetic iterative method can also be applied straightforwardly to other canonical gas ﬂows,
such as Couette ﬂow and the ﬂow driven by a concentration gradient. However, it requires future
work to investigate whether this method can be applied to other gas ﬂow systems or not.
