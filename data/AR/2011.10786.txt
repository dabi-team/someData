Low-lying excited states in the N = 32 isotope 50Ar were investigated by in-beam γ-ray spec-
troscopy following proton- and neutron-knockout, multi-nucleon removal, and proton inelastic scat-
tering at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory. The energies of the two previously reported
transitions have been conﬁrmed, and ﬁve additional states are presented for the ﬁrst time, including
a candidate for a 3− state. The level scheme built using γγ coincidences was compared to shell-
model calculations in the sd − pf model space, and to ab initio predictions based on chiral two- and
three-nucleon interactions. Theoretical proton- and neutron-knockout cross sections suggest that
two of the new transitions correspond to 2+ states, while the previously proposed 4+
1 state could
also correspond to a 2+ state.

INTRODUCTION

the location of single-particle orbitals deﬁnes shell clo-
sures and associated magic numbers. Experimental evi-

Our understanding of the atomic nucleus has as one of
its cornerstones the concept of shell structure, in which

 
 
 
 
 
 
dence collected in the past decades, particularly since the
advent of radioactive ion beams, has shown that shell
structure undergoes signiﬁcant changes for isotopes far
from stability [1]. Examples of this shell-evolution are
the onset of N = 16 as a magic number for O isotopes [2–
4] and the disappearance of the canonical magic number
N = 20 around 32Mg [5, 6].

A particularly interesting case to study shell evolution
is the region around the Ca isotopes between N = 28
and N = 40, where the development of shell closures for
N = 32 and N = 34 has recently gained signiﬁcant at-
tention. In the Ca isotopes, the N = 32 sub-shell closure
was ﬁrst evidenced by its relatively high E(2+
1 ) energy [7],
and conﬁrmed by two-proton knockout cross section [8]
and mass measurements [9]. In turn, the ﬁrst suggestion
of the N = 34 shell closure on 54Ca was also provided
by the E(2+
1 ) measurement [10] and conﬁrmed by sys-
tematic mass measurements [11] and neutron-knockout
reactions [12].

The persistence of these shell closures below and above
Z = 20 has also been widely investigated. The preserva-
tion of the N = 32 shell closure above Ca has been de-
termined in Ti and Cr via spectroscopy [13, 14], reduced
transition probabilities [15, 16], and precision mass mea-
surements [17]. On the other hand, the N = 34 shell
closure has been suggested to disappear above Ca [18].
This is in contrast with the recently reported ﬁrst spec-
troscopy measurement on 52Ar, where the experimental
value of E(2+
1 ) suggests the conservation of the N = 34
shell closure for Z = 18 [19].

1 ), a E(4+

The ﬁrst spectroscopy of 50Ar showed a relatively high
E(2+
1 ) energy of 1178(18) keV [20]. In that study, apart
from the E(2+
1 ) was tentatively assigned, al-
though the limited statistics prevented a ﬁrmer conclu-
sion [20]. No further spectroscopic information is avail-
able for this very exotic nucleus. The increase of the
E(2+
1 ) with respect to neighboring isotopes has been in-
terpreted as an indication of a sizable N = 32 gap along
the Ar isotopic chain, therefore maintaining this sub-shell
closure below 52Ca [20].

From a theoretical point of view, the tensor-force-
driven shell evolution has been used to explain the ap-
pearance of the N = 32 and N = 34 shell closures [21].
In this framework, the reduction of the attractive proton-
neutron interaction between the πf7/2 and the νf5/2
single-particle orbitals results in a separation between
these levels and the formation of substantial neutron
gaps. Calculations including this eﬀect [22, 23] success-
fully reproduce the E(2+
1 ) of Ar isotopes [19, 20] and
suggest the magnitude of the N = 34 sub-shell closure in
52Ar to be around 3 MeV.

The signiﬁcance of three-nucleon forces (3NFs) in the
description of neutron-rich isotopes has also been stud-
ied [24, 25], and the relevance of this contribution to ob-
tain an accurate description of the spectroscopic prop-
erties of Ca isotopes has been highlighted [26]. In par-
ticular, ab initio calculations with the valence-space in-
medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG)

2

method [27–29] including 3NFs have provided a satis-
factory description of the E(2+
1 ) along the Ar isotopic
chain [19].

Our understanding of the nature of these sub-shell clo-
sures relies on the interpretation provided by the theoret-
ical calculations. The validity of this picture can be fur-
ther tested by studying its agreement with other nuclear
properties, for example, the energies of low-lying states
beyond the 2+
1 . To get a better insight into the struc-
ture at the N = 32 shell closure below Ca, the present
work reports low-lying states in 50Ar populated following
direct and indirect reactions.

II. EXPERIMENT

The experiment was performed at the Radioactive Iso-
tope Beam Factory, operated by the RIKEN Nishina
Center and the Center for Nuclear Study of the Uni-
versity of Tokyo. A 70Zn beam with an energy of
345 MeV/nucleon and an average intensity of 240 pnA
was fragmented on a 3-mm thick Be target to pro-
duce the secondary beam cocktail. Fragments of inter-
est were selected by the BigRIPS separator [30] using
the Bρ − ∆E − Bρ technique. Event-by-event iden-
tiﬁcation was obtained by an energy-loss measurement
in an ionization chamber, position and angle measure-
ments with parallel plate avalanche counters, at diﬀer-
ent focal planes, and the time-of-ﬂight measured between
two plastic scintillators [30]. The selected isotopes were
focused in front of the SAMURAI dipole magnet [31],
where the 151.3(13)-mm long liquid hydrogen target of
MINOS [32, 33] was placed. Thanks to the use of a time
projection chamber surrounding the target, it was possi-
ble to reconstruct the reaction vertex with a resolution
of 2 mm (σ) [33]. Following the reactions in the target,
ions were identiﬁed using the SAMURAI magnet and as-
sociated detectors. Positions and angles were measured
at two multi-wire drift chambers placed in front and be-
hind the magnet, the time-of-ﬂight was obtained from a
scintillator placed in front of the target and a hodoscope
located downstream of SAMURAI, which also provided
an energy loss measurement from which the atomic num-
ber was inferred [31].

The high-eﬃciency γ-ray detector array DALI2+ [34,
35], composed of 226 NaI(Tl) detectors, was placed
around MINOS to detect de-excitation γ rays. The array,
which covered detection angles between ∼12◦ and ∼118◦
with respect to the center of the target, was calibrated
in energy using standard 60Co, 88Y, 133Ba, and 137Cs
sources. The full-energy-peak eﬃciency of the array, de-
termined using a detailed GEANT4 [36] simulation, was
30% at 1 MeV with an energy resolution of 11% for a
source moving at a velocity of 0.6c. Previous results and
further details from the same experiment can be found
in Refs. [12, 19, 37, 38].

III. RESULTS

Low-lying states in 50Ar were populated by direct and
indirect reactions. For each reaction channel inclusive
cross sections were obtained using the eﬀective transmis-
sion of 50Ar (which includes the eﬃciency of the beam
line detectors and the beam losses in the detectors and
the target) measured to be 56.7(15)%, and the eﬃciency
of MINOS for each reaction. Table I summarizes the
number of events in each reaction channel, the mean inci-
dent beam energy, the experimental eﬃciency of MINOS,
and the corresponding inclusive cross sections.

Doppler corrected γ-ray spectra were obtained using
the reaction vertex and the velocity of the fragment re-
constructed with MINOS. Peak-to-total ratio and detec-
tion eﬃciency were improved by adding-up the energies
of γ rays deposited in detectors up to 10 cm apart. To
reduce the contribution of the low-energy atomic back-
ground, γ rays with energies below 100 keV in the lab-
oratory frame of reference were not considered for the
add-back.

Figure 1a) shows the Doppler-corrected spectrum ob-
tained following multinucleon removal reactions, when
the γ-ray multiplicity (Mγ) was limited to a maximum
of four. The spectrum was ﬁtted with simulated response
functions of the DALI2+array and a double exponential
function used to model the low- and high-energy back-
ground. The slopes of the two exponential functions were
ﬁxed by independent ﬁts of the high- and low-energy re-
gions. Six transitions at 826(7)(8) keV, 1151(1)(12) keV,
1593(6)(16) keV, 1892(11)(19) keV, 2227(19)(22) keV,
and 2657(21)(27) keV provided the best ﬁt to the spec-
trum. The ﬁrst reported uncertainty corresponds to the
statistical error from the ﬁt, while the second is the sys-
tematic error arising from the calibration of the γ-ray
detectors and the possible lifetime of the states. To
place the observed transitions in a level scheme, γγ co-
incidences were investigated. Figure 1b) displays the γ-

the reaction channels populating 50Ar. The total number of
events measured in each channel, the mean incident beam
energy (Ebeam), as well as the eﬃciency of MINOS (εMINOS)
are listed.

ray spectrum gated between 1090 keV and 1210 keV. A
single background gate between 3000 keV and 4000 keV
was used. Due to the many transitions observed in the
spectrum it was not possible to place a more appropri-
ate background gate. As a results, the transition where
the gate was placed could not be completely removed by
the background subtraction. Hence, the possibility of a
doublet cannot be fully excluded. The best ﬁt to the
resulting spectrum, shown by the red line, was obtained
by using the same response functions as in Fig 1a), sug-
gesting that all the transitions are coincident with the
one at ∼1150 keV. Calculations on the expected number
of counts in the coincidence spectrum obtained based on
the area of the gate and the eﬃciency of DALI2+, are
consistent with the observations, as shown by the blue
line Fig. 1b).

tained for 50Ar produced by the proton-knockout reac-

this spectrum are 1150(1)(11) keV, 1592(23)(16) keV,
1905(3)(19) keV, and 2618(6)(26) keV. The spectrum re-
sembles the one observed for the multinucleon removal,
and in fact all of the transitions observed seem to corre-
spond within uncertainties to transitions also present in
Fig. 1. In this case, however, the intensity of the transi-
tion around ∼ 1600 keV is smaller, while the transitions
at ∼ 1900 keV and ∼ 2600 keV are more intense. The
transition observed in Fig. 1 at ∼ 824 was observed with
a signiﬁcance below 1σ, and the one at ∼ 2230 keV was
not visible in this spectrum. The projection of the γγ ma-
trix gated around ∼ 1150 keV is shown in Fig. 2b). The
best ﬁt to the spectrum was obtained using the same
four response functions used to ﬁt the total spectrum,
indicating that the transitions are coincident with the
one at ∼ 1150 keV. As in the case of Fig. 1a), it was
not possible to completely remove the transition where
the gate was placed by background subtraction.
It is
noted that for the 51K(p, 2p)50Ar and the multinucleon
removal reactions, gates around ∼ 1600 keV, ∼ 1900 keV,
and ∼ 2600 keV only showed the reciprocal coincidence
of these transitions with the one at ∼ 1150 keV.

The Doppler-corrected spectrum corresponding to the
51Ar(p, pn)50Ar
reaction is displayed in Fig. 3a). Two
peaks are visible in the spectrum with a signiﬁcance
above 2σ. The best ﬁt yields transition energies of

1150(8)(11) keV, and 1602(31)(16) keV. The γγ analy-
sis shown in Fig. 3b) clearly establishes the existence of
the peak at ∼ 1600 keV, and shows that it is coinci-
dent with the one at ∼ 1150 keV. The energies observed
in these spectrum are consistent with the ones obtained
previously, suggesting the population of the same levels.
Figure 4a) shows the Doppler-corrected spectrum ob-
tained for the 50Ar(p, p′)50Ar reaction. Three transi-
tions are visible and the transition energies obtained
for this case are 1138(8)(11) keV, 1626(33)(16) keV,
and 2890(31)(29) keV. The background-subtracted co-
incidence spectrum, in Fig. 4b), shows that the transi-
tion at 2890 keV is coincident with the one at 1138 keV.
No coincidence between the transitions at 1626 keV and
1138 keV was observed, which can be attributed to the
reduced statistics.

Based on the γγ analysis discussed above, the tenta-
tive level scheme shown in Fig. 5a) was constructed. The
energies of low-lying states in 50Ar were calculated as
the weighted average of the values obtained from the dif-
ferent reactions, when applicable. The weights were de-
termined based only on the statistical uncertainty, and
the systematic error was added in quadrature. Being
the one with the highest intensity, the 1150(12) keV
transition was placed decaying directly into the ground
state. This transition agrees, within error bars, with the

one at 1178(18) keV reported in Ref. [20], where it was
tentatively assigned to the 2+
gs transition. The
transitions at 826(9) keV, 1594(16) keV, 1903(19) keV,
2227(30) keV, and 2621(32) keV, were placed feeding
the (2+

ing states at 1976(15) keV, 2744(20) keV, 3053(23) keV,
3377(32) keV, and 3771(34) keV, respectively. The transi-
tion at 1594(16) keV agrees with the one at 1582(38) keV
reported in Ref. [20], where a 4+
1 assignment was sug-
gested. The transition at 2890(42) keV observed in the
50Ar(p, p′)50Ar reaction was placed on top of the 2+
1
state, depopulating a level at 4040(44) keV. It has been
shown by previous measurements on 46Ar [40], 50Ca [41],
and 54Ti [42], that proton inelastic scattering populates
preferentially 2+, 4+, and 3− states, therefore a 3− spin
and parity can be reasonably assigned to this level. The
spin assignment for the 2744(20) keV level, also observed
in this reaction, could then be either 2+ or 4+. Further
discussion on the possible spin and parity assignments for
the levels obtained in this work will be presented below.

For the direct reactions, exclusive cross sections to
populate each observed state were obtained from the ﬁt-
ted γ-ray intensities. Table II summarizes the adopted
level energies and exclusive cross sections obtained in
this work. Based on simulated angular distributions of
the γ-rays, an additional uncertainty of 4% has been in-

cluded to account for possible alignment of the states.
The ground state cross section was calculated by sub-
tracting the exclusive cross sections from the inclusive
one reported in Table I. The high background level, low
statistics and limited resolution of DALI2+could prevent
the observation of low-intensity, high-energy transitions
feeding directly the 0+
gs state, therefore the ground-state
cross section is prone to be overestimated. In addition,
it was not possible to disentangle between the direct
51Ar(p, pn)50Ar reaction and the scattering followed by
neutron emission, 51Ar(p, p′)51Ar→ 50Ar + n, therefore,
all the cross sections for this channel are to be considered
as an upper limit.

IV. DISCUSSION

Predictions for the energies of low-lying states in 50Ar
were obtained within the shell-model framework using
the SDPF-MU eﬀective interaction [43] and considering
the full sd and pf model space for protons and neu-
trons. The original Hamiltonian was modiﬁed [44] using
experimental data on exotic Ca [10] and K [45] isotopes.
These calculations have previously provided good agree-
ment with the experimental E(2+
1 ) energies
in neutron-rich Ar isotopes [20] and suggest a N = 32
gap of ∼ 3 MeV for 50Ar. Although this gap is predicted
to be of similar magnitude as for 52Ca, the wave function
of the 2+
1 state for 50Ar turns out to be more mixed than
the one for 52Ca, making the eﬀect of this shell closure
less evident [20].

Calculations were also performed using the ab initio
VS-IMSRG approach using the chiral NN+3N interac-
tion labeled 1.8/2.0 (EM) in Refs. [46, 47]. This NN+3N
interaction is based on chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory [48, 49],
a low-energy eﬀective theory of quantum chromodynam-
ics, with low-energy constants ﬁtted to the properties of
the lightest nuclei up to 4He. The same chiral interac-
tion has been successfully used to study E(2+
1 ) in the Ar
isotopic chain [19], as well as excitation spectra from oxy-

gen [50] to nickel [51] and tin [52] isotopes. For the model
spaces, the sd space was considered for the protons, and
the pf for the neutrons, preventing the calculation of neg-
ative parity states. As in previous works [19, 50–52] the
IMSRG(2) approximation, where all induced operators
are truncated at the two-body level, was employed. The
VS-IMSRG was used to decouple a valence-space Hamil-
tonian, which captures 3N forces between valence nucle-
ons via an ensemble normal ordering, for each nucleus of
interest [53].

Spectroscopic factors, C2S, were calculated within
each model. For the case of the 51K(p, 2p)50Ar reaction,
the J π = 3/2+ ground state for 51K was employed [45, 54]
and knockout from the sd shell was considered, leading
to the population of positive parity states exclusively.
For the case of the 51Ar(p, pn)50Ar
reaction the pre-
dicted ground-state spin of 1/2− for 51Ar was assumed.

culations. By enlarging the conﬁguration space of this
theoretical framework to include the sd − pf orbitals for
protons and neutrons, additional excited states may ap-
pear at lower energies. The SDPF-MU calculations also
predict signiﬁcant population of more levels, in particular
of the 2+

2 and states with spin and parity 1+ and 4+.
To get an insight on the spin and parity of the ob-
served levels, single-particle theoretical cross sections
were computed in the DWIA framework [56] using the
Bohr-Mottelson single-particle potential [57]. For the op-
tical potentials of the distorted waves, the microscopic
folding model [58] with the Melbourne G-matrix inter-
action [59] and calculated nuclear density was employed.
The Franey-Love eﬀective proton-proton interaction was
adopted [60] and the spin-orbit part of each distorting po-
tential was disregarded. Cross sections at diﬀerent beam
energies were calculated to take into account the energy
loss of the beam in the thick target. The calculated
single-particle cross sections were multiplied by the spec-
troscopic factors calculated for the reactions in each the-
oretical framework. Tables III and IV show the obtained
results for the 51K(p, 2p)50Ar and 51Ar(p, pn)50Ar reac-
tions, respectively.

The E(2+

1 ) of 50Ar is accurately reproduced by both
calculations, and a 0+
2 is predicted to be the next ex-
cited state. The experimental level at 1976(15) keV has
a good agreement with this state. It is noted that the
SPDF-MU calculations predict the 0+
2 state of 56Cr to
be 1982.1 keV, in fair agreement with the tentative ex-
perimental level at 1674.5(4) keV [55]. The structure at
higher energies also presents many similarities: The next
levels predicted to be populated are the 4+
3 and
2+
4 . However, the energies predicted in the VS-IMSRG
approach are modestly higher than in the SDPF-MU cal-

1 , 2+

1 , 1+

The calculated ground state cross section for both re-
actions is much lower than the experimental values. As
already mentioned this is due to the non-observation of
states decaying directly to the 0+
1 state, which results
in an over-estimation of the experimental cross section.
For the case of the 51K(p, 2p)50Ar reaction, the SDPF-
MU and VS-IMSRG calculations predict a cross section
to the 2+
1 state of 1.0 mb and 0.62 mb, respectively,
in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of
0.8(2) mb. At higher energies the SPDF-MU calcula-
tion suggest the population of the 2+
5 states.

Although high cross sections are also predicted for the
2 and 1+
1+
4 states, they would decay preferentially to the
ground-state, therefore its correspondence to any exper-
imental level is unlikely. They may, however, account
for the seeming too high experimental population of the
ground state when compared to calculated cross sections.
The VS-IMSRG calculation, on the other hand, only in-
dicates the population of the 2+
1 states. The fact
that the VS-IMSRG calculations only predicts two states
with sizable sd-proton cross-sections is related with the
reduced model space, which prevents proton pf −sd exci-
tations. This in turn, highlights the importance of such
excitations in the population of low-lying states. They
will be investigated in the future with a newly developed
cross-shell VS-IMSRG approach [61]. In spite of the dif-
ferences between the models, they both point out that
the 51K(p, 2p)50Ar reaction mostly populates 2+ states.
The experimental levels at 2744(20) keV, 3053(23) keV,

4 and 4+

3 , 2+

and 3771(34) keV, observed in this reaction, are in fair
4 , and 2+
agreement with the predictions for the 2+
5
states in the SDPF-MU model. We therefore tentatively
assign this spin and parity to these states. The level
at 2744(20) keV has been previously suggested to be the
4+
1 [20]. Although the SDPF-MU calculations favors a 2+
assignment, the comparison with the VS-IMSRG results
make it also compatible with the 4+
1 . Furthermore, the
population of this state in the 50Ar(p, p′)50Ar
reaction
favors a 4+
1 assignment. Therefore a (2+, 4+) assignment
is left open for this state. It is worth mentioning that the
state at 1976(15) keV has a negligible cross section for the
51K(p, 2p)50Ar reaction, which is consistent with the the-
oretical predictions for the 0+
2 state. The agreement be-
tween the SDPF-MU and VS-IMSRG calculations on the
energy and spectroscopic factor of the 0+
2 state suggest
that it is spherical in nature, as the VS-IMSRG does not
properly account for deformed low-lying states [37, 51].

For the 51Ar(p, pn)50Ar reaction the theoretical models
predict a 2+
1 state cross section of ∼ 7 − 8 mb, while the
experimental value is 15(4) mb. In this case, the exper-
imental over-estimation comes from the impossibility to
distinguish between the direct and indirect reactions in
this channel. The next states with the higher predicted
cross section are the 1+
1 , 4+
3 states in both calcu-
lations. In the VS-IMSRG, population to the 3+
3 state at
4428 keV is also predicted. As previously noted, the 1+
1
state would most probably decay directly to the ground-
state. Furthermore, the 3+
3 is not predicted by the VS-
IMSRG to be populated in the 51K(p, 2p)50Ar reaction,
so it is improbable that it corresponds to an experimental
level. The ambiguity between the 2+ and 4+ characters
for the state at 2744(20) keV observed in this reaction is
therefore maintained.

1 , and 2+

−
Finally, theoretical predictions of the systematic of 3
1
states for the N = 32 isotones have been obtained us-
ing the SDPF-MU calculations and confronted to avail-
able data [42, 62] including the state at 4040(44) keV
−
obtained in this work, as shown in Fig. 6. The E(3
1 )
for 50Ar is comparable in magnitude to the one of 52Ca,
and the theoretical predictions show a good agreement
with both isotopes, reinforcing the spin and parity as-
signments. However, the calculations overestimate the
−
1 ) as Z increases. For nuclei around Ca, the Fermi
E(3
surface is located near the Z = 20 shell gap, therefore
proton excitations require less energy. This is reﬂected
in the calculations by the low 3− levels predicted for 50Ar,
52Ca, and 54Ti, where the calculations show a good agree-
ment with the data. Going towards the Si isotopes, the
excitation from the p shell to the sd shell becomes likely.
This possible excitation is not taken into account in the
−
calculations, which in turn increases the predicted E(3
1 )
energies. On the other side, towards higher Z, the exper-
imental levels are rather stable around 4 MeV, but the
calculations are not able to reproduce them. In Ni, pro-
ton excitations from the sd to the pf shells, as well as
neutron excitations from the pf to the sdg shells may
contribute. In particular, it has been reported that the
neutron excitations from the pf to the sdg shell are not
well reproduced due to a too large shell gap between pf
and sdg shells, and it has been suggested that it is nec-
essary to lower the sdg shell by 1 MeV to reproduce the
negative parity states of Ni isotopes [63, 64].

V. SUMMARY

Low-lying levels of 50Ar have been investigated by
proton- and neutron-knockout reactions, inelastic proton
scattering, and multinucleon removal reactions. Based
on the γγ analysis, a level scheme was constructed, in-
cluding ﬁve newly observed transitions among which a
candidate for the 3− state has been reported for the
ﬁrst time. The experimental level scheme was compared
to theoretical calculations performed in the SDPF-MU
shell model, as well as the ab initio VS-IMSRG approach.

FIG. 6. Systematics of E(3
) for even-even N = 32 isotones.
The circles represent the available data [42, 62], including the
value for 50Ar reported in this work. The solid line shows the
SDPF-MU calculations.

Both calculations predict similar level schemes for 50Ar.
Theoretical cross sections for the 51K(p, 2p)50Ar
and
51Ar(p, pn)50Ar were compared to the observed ones,
to infer the spin and parity of the states. Two of the
newly observed states were tentatively assigned a (2+)
spin and parity, and it was shown that the state previ-
ously suggested to be the 4+
1 could also correspond to a
2+ state.

Overall, both theoretical calculations provide consis-
tent results and a relatively good agreement with the
experimental data for both the 51K(p, 2p)50Ar
and
51Ar(p, pn)50Ar reactions. This emphasizes the sub-shell
closure at N = 32 and our understanding of shell evolu-
tion in this region. The remaining diﬀerences among cal-
culations most likely arise from the reduced proton and
neutron spaces employed in the VS-IMSRG and highight
their importance in the understanding of the low-lying
structure of 50Ar.
