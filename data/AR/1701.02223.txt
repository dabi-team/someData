Frequency-modulation (FM) spectroscopy has been extended to the vacuum-

ultraviolet (VUV) range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Coherent VUV laser radi-

ation is produced by resonance-enhanced sum-frequency mixing (νVUV = 2νUV + ν2)

in Kr and Xe using two near-Fourier-transform-limited laser pulses of frequencies

νUV and ν2. Sidebands generated in the output of the second laser (ν2) using an

electro-optical modulator operating at the frequency νmod are directly transfered to

the VUV and used to record FM spectra. Demodulation is demonstrated both at

νmod and 2νmod. The main advantages of the method compared to VUV absorption

spectroscopy is its background-free nature, the fact that its implementation using

table-top laser equipment is straightforward and that it can be used to record VUV

absorption spectra of cold samples in skimmed supersonic beams simultaneously with

laser-induced-ﬂuorescence and photoionization spectra. To illustrate these advan-

tages we present VUV FM spectra of Ar, Kr, and N2 in selected regions between

105 000 cm−1 and 122 000 cm−1.

INTRODUCTION

Frequency-modulation (FM) spectroscopy is a very sensitive and powerful method to

record atomic and molecular laser spectra in the gas phase1–7. Originally, the method

was introduced to exploit the advantages of narrow-band lasers for spectroscopic investi-

gations in the infrared (IR) and the visible (VIS) ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Eyler and coworkers later applied the method in combination with nonlinear frequency-

upconversion methods to extend the wavelength range to the UV down to 214.5 nm and

achieved an absorption sensitivity of 8

10−4 in this range.7 The high sensitivity results from

the background-free nature of the detection of the absorption signals. FM spectroscopy

·

relies on the modulation at frequency νmod of a narrow-band laser operated at frequency

νL, resulting in an amplitude spectrum schematically depicted in Fig. 1 for the modulation

indices β = 0.5 and 1.25 relevant for the present investigation (β deﬁnes the sideband-to-

carrier ratio, see Ref. 8 for additional details). Maximal sensitivity is reached when the

modulation frequency is larger than the intrinsic linewidth of the transitions. This property

prompted Janik et al.6 to demodulate the signals at a frequency 2νmod instead of νmod to

improve the contrast in the case of a linewidth Γ comparable to νmod.

In this article, we present an extension of FM spectroscopy to the vacuum-ultraviolet

(VUV, λ < 200 nm) range of the electromagnetic spectrum and explore the sensitivity of de-

modulation at both νmod and 2νmod. High-resolution absorption spectroscopy below 200 nm

is notoriously diﬃcult.

In early high-resolution spectroscopic work in the VUV, the ab-

sorption spectra were recorded using high-pressure lamps in combination with large VUV

monochromators9–13, enabling resolution of about 0.5 cm−1 between 10 eV and 20 eV. By re-

placing the high-pressure lamps by synchrotron radiation, spectroscopic measurements could

be extended beyond 20 eV. VUV radiation from synchrotron sources, however, also needs

to be monochromatized, which limits the bandwidth of the radiation to at best 0.1 cm−1.14

VUV Fourier-transform absorption spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation was recently

extended to the range below 105 nm and oﬀers the multiplex advantage, but so far the best

resolution achieved with this method is 0.33 cm−1.15 Pulsed VUV laser systems based on

four-wave mixing enable a higher resolution (better than 200 MHz, see Refs. 16–19), but the

large pulse-to-pulse ﬂuctuations resulting from the nonlinearity of the VUV generation pro-

cess limits the sensitivity of absorption measurements. Consequently, only few VUV-laser-

absorption spectra of atoms and molecules in supersonic beams have been reported.17,19–21

Supersonic beams enable one to cool the internal degrees of freedom of molecules and to re-

duce spectral congestion and Doppler broadening, however, at the cost of a reduced column

density. To improve the low sensitivity resulting from the large pulse-to-pulse ﬂuctuations of

the VUV laser radiation, Sommavilla et al.22,23 have used a dispersion grating and exploited

the beam diﬀracted in the negative ﬁrst order to normalize the VUV laser intensity pulse by

pulse and were able to reliably measure relative changes of the transmission of 10−4, which

is suﬃcient to record VUV absorption spectra of molecules in cold supersonic beams.

be used to record VUV spectra with high sensitivity, the line intensities may be reduced,

compared to an absorption spectrum, by predissociation. Here, we present an alternative

method to record VUV absorption spectra with high sensitivity that relies on FM techniques.

Tunable VUV radiation is produced from the output of two Fourier-transform-limited pulsed

lasers (pulse length 5 ns, obtained by pulse ampliﬁcation of cw single-mode ring laser ra-

diation) by two-color resonance-enhanced four-wave mixing (˜νVUV = 2˜νUV + ˜ν2) in Kr or

Xe. The modulation of the VUV laser frequency is achieved by generating sidebands on

the output of the second laser (˜ν2) using an electro-optical modulator. These sidebands

are automatically transferred to the VUV, because the four-wave-mixing process is linearly

dependent on the intensity of the second laser.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND PROCEDURE

The experimental setup used in this work is depicted schematically in Fig. 2 and consists

of a laser system (Section II A) and vacuum chambers where the absorption experiments are

carried out on cold gaseous samples in skimmed supersonic beams. Critical components for

the success of the experiment such as the (de)modulation setup and the home-built VUV

photodetector are described in Sections II B and II C, respectively. Section II D presents

the diﬀerent detection schemes used to characterize the VUV absorption and Section II E

provides details of the analysis of the lineshapes.

lasers (Coherent 699-21 and 899-29, output power of about 500 mW) using dye cells pumped

by the second harmonic of a pulsed, injection-seeded Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics, Quanta

Ray Lab 170, pulse length of about 8 ns, repetition rate 25 Hz). To generate the desired wave

number ˜νUV, the ampliﬁed laser radiation is up-converted to ˜νUV = 3˜ν1 using two successive

β-barium-borate crystals (BBO), see Ref. 18 for details. The beam with wave number ˜ν2 is

the pulsed-ampliﬁed fundamental output of the second ring dye laser or its second harmonic.

As long as the modulation index of the fundamental output remains below 0.5, the doubled

output is characterized by approximately the same modulation index as the fundamental

because the sidebands are too weak to be eﬃciently frequency doubled. The two two-photon

resonances listed above enable the generation of VUV radiation over a broad spectral range

of about 60 000 cm−1 to 135 000 cm−1.

The sum-frequency VUV laser radiation with wave number ˜νVUV = 2˜νUV + ˜ν2 is separated

from the fundamental laser beams and beams generated through other nonlinear processes

in a vacuum monochromator. The separation is achieved with a toroidal grating, which also

refocusses the VUV radiation at the exit slit of the monochromator chamber.26 The detected

VUV-laser beam intersects one or more pulsed skimmed supersonic beams of the sample gas

at right angles in the absorption chambers. The VUV-laser pulses have a duration (full width

at half maximum) of approximately 2.5 ns and a bandwidth of approximately 300 MHz.

The absorption chambers consist of two separate diﬀerentially pumped regions. The

probe-gas beams are generated by supersonic expansion using pulsed valves (Parker, Gen-

eral Valve, Series 9, valve oriﬁce diameter 1 mm) operated at a stagnation pressure of about

5

2 bar. The opening time of the valves is typically 200 µs. In the ﬁrst region, referred to as

photoionization chamber below, a single probe-gas beam is collimated at a distance of 2 cm

from the valve oriﬁce by a skimmer (Beam Dynamics, oriﬁce diameter 2 mm). Photoexci-

tation takes place on the axis of a linear time-of-ﬂight photoionization mass spectrometer

with which photoionization spectra can be recorded after the photoions are extracted with

a pulsed electric ﬁeld towards a microchannel-plate (MCP) detector. With this detector,

the ﬂuorescence induced by the VUV radiation can also be monitored. In the second region,

referred to as absorption chamber below, up to ten nozzles located 2.0 cm above their respec-

tive skimmers (oriﬁce diameter 1 mm) are used.23 The transmitted VUV intensity is detected

using a home-built VUV photodetector (see Section II C). The detector signals are ampli-

ﬁed and processed using a digital oscilloscope (Teledyne LeCroy, WavePro 760Zi, 6 GHz

oscilloscope), transferred to a computer, and recorded as a function of the wave number ˜ν2.

The fundamental wavenumber of the second ring dye laser is calibrated by recording a

laser-induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) spectrum of molecular iodine and the transmission signals

through two ´etalons using a fraction of the cw laser output. The output of the frequency-

ﬁxed ﬁrst ring dye laser (˜ν1 = 1

3 ˜νUV) is diﬀracted using an accousto-optical modulator
operated at 675 MHz. In the case of sum-frequency mixing in Kr, the zero-order beam is

transmitted to the ampliﬁcation chain whereas the frequency of the ﬁrst-order sideband is

locked to the “t” hyperﬁne component of the B 3Π+

B. Modulation/Demodulation Units

To exploit the advantages of modulation techniques in experiments with nanosecond

laser pulses, the modulation frequency has to be chosen carefully.

It has to be higher

than the inverse of the duration of a single laser pulse so that there are at least a few

oscillation cycles within the typical laser-pulse duration of 2 ns to 2.5 ns. The argument can

also be formulated in the frequency domain: The modulation frequency should exceed the

bandwidth of the unmodulated pulse. The modulation frequency also has to be low enough

so that the bandwidth of the VUV detector (see Section II C) can resolve the modulation of

the laser pulse resulting from absorption. We found a modulation of about 1.4 GHz to be

an optimal compromise and, therefore, used a resonantly driven electro-optical modulator

(EOM).

The ﬁxed output of the modulation source (Anapico APSIN6010) is split into two parts

using a coupler (Mini Circuit ZADC-6-2G). The main output of the coupler feeds the ref-

erence arm of the demodulator used to demodulate the VUV signal, whereas the coupled

output is used to drive the EOM (Qubig T1500M3-400/800). To adjust the intensity of the

signal used to modulate the cw output of the second ring dye laser to a desired modulation

index β, a step attenuator (Narda 4748-69) is used in combination with a power ampliﬁer

(Becker AMP 20280035). The resonance frequency of the EOM is optimized by minimiz-

ing the reﬂected modulation intensity monitored using a circulator (RYT 300010) and a

home-built diode detector and determined to be 1.3875 GHz. Small variations of the EOM

resonance frequency were observed and the necessary adjustments carried out daily.

To demodulate the VUV signal, we investigated both the standard demodulation tech-

nique at νmod (referred to as 1f demodulation below) and the demodulation technique at
2νmod (2f) used by Janik et al.6. For 2f detection the modulation signal is ampliﬁed (Tron-

Tech P23GA) and frequency doubled (Watkins Johnson FD25HC) to drive the demodulation

mixer. A small attenuator improves the impedance matching.

In the case of 1f (2f) demodulation, the VUV signal is ﬁrst ampliﬁed (INA 34063) and

then split using a diplexer (1f: ALRCOM FC 8312A; 2f: Microwave Circuit D9002G61)

into a low- and a high-frequency component. The low-frequency component below 1.05 GHz

(2.0 GHz) is used to monitor the envelope of the VUV signal and its amplitude represents

the transmission signal. The high-frequency component of the VUV signal from the diplexer

in the range 1.2–5.0 GHz (2.4–2.9 GHz) is demodulated at 1.3875 GHz (or 2.775 GHz) using

a double balanced mixer (Watkins Johnson WJ-M1G). The demodulated signal is then

ampliﬁed (Q-Bit QBH-9-131) and recorded with the digital oscilloscope. The phase shift

between the VUV signal and the reference signal is adjusted using a “trombone” phase shifter

(Spinner, 152254) in the reference signal path. On a strong absorption line, the position of

the phase shifter for absorption (in-phase, φ = 0) and dispersion (φ = π

2 ) are determined
by comparison with calculated line shapes. As illustration, Fig. 3 displays FM spectra of

the (4p)5 (2P3/2) 7d[3/2]1

(4p)6 1S0 transition of Kr recorded for diﬀerent lengths of the

←

phase shifter and compares them with calculated spectra for the phases indicated in the

respective panels. The lengths of the phase shifter (medium: air) needed to achieve phase

shifts of 2π for the modulation frequency 1.3875 GHz (2.775 GHz) is 21.6 cm (10.8 cm), which

corresponds to the wavelength in ambient air.

C. VUV Detector

For the experiments presented in this article, we developed a fast vacuum photodiode

following principles found in the literature.30–32 Fig. 4 (a) depicts a section through the

10-mm-diameter cylindrically symmetric detector. This home-built detector consists of (i)

a 10-mm-diameter polished copper disk serving as photocathode,33 (ii) a positively biased

anode consisting of a woven stainless-steel mesh with a transmittance of 84% located at a

distance of 1 mm from the cathode, (iii) a coaxially tapered transmission line with a brass

cone as central conductor and an aluminum ISO-KF reduction ﬂange as an outer conductor

at ground potential. At the vacuum interface, the diameter of the cathode is reduced to the

dimension of the coaxial signal connector with a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω.34 Fig. 4

(b) shows a schematic circuit diagram containing most critical components. The 20 MΩ

resistor, the 100 pF capacitor and the 10 µH inductor are discrete components and ﬁlter

the noise from the bias power supply. The capacitance of 32 pF results from the dielectric

properties of the copper-cladded circuit board (Rodgers 3020) holding the anode mesh and

is used as charge storage for the signal-induced current. The 50 Ω resistor serves as damping

element and is composed by 10 resistors of 500 Ω soldered in parallel onto the circuit board.

The temporal response is governed by circuit properties. The 0–100% rise time corresponds

to the transit time of the photoelectrons (0.1 ns under typical operation conditions), which

is proportional to the distance between cathode and anode and inversely proportional to

the square root of the bias voltage. The signal decays exponentially with a time constant

(τ = 120 ps) given by the load resistance and the capacitance between cathode and anode.35

Lacking an appropriate impulse source, we could not directly measure the time resolution

of the detector but instead measured the reﬂection coeﬃcient up to 6 GHz, which should

ideally be 1.0 for all frequencies. The ﬁrst deviation occurred at 5.1 GHz, where it dropped

to 0.5. No resonances were detected in the vicinity of the modulation frequency (νmod) and

its second harmonic (2νmod). Fig. 5 compares a time trace of the VUV-laser intensity with
the laser frequency adjusted such that the lower sideband is resonant with the (4p)5 (2P3/2)

VUV detector. The corresponding power spectra obtained by Fourier transformation are

originates from ´etalon eﬀects in the optical setup and absorption by the background gas in

the vacuum chamber.

D. Signal detection

To obtain the VUV FM spectra we used the phase-sensitive detection method rather

than the Fourier power spectrum of the time domain VUV-detector signal, which can be

easily calculated on the oscilloscope, but is phase-insensitive. The power spectra neverthe-

less proved to be a useful diagnostic tool to optimize the signals. The time traces of the

demodulated signals recorded at the digital oscilloscope and typically averaged over 50 laser

shots were transferred to a computer and recorded as a function of the VUV wave number.

To obtain artefact-free spectra, it was necessary to remove the background contribution

to the signal, as illustrated be Fig. 6, which shows FM VUV spectra of the b(cid:48) 1Σ+

The latter spectrum reveals a regular oscillation which originates from an ´etalon eﬀect

aﬀecting the laser beam of frequency ν2 and also a broad contribution (not seen on the scale

of the ﬁgure) from the room-temperature background N2 gas in the chamber. The ´etalon

eﬀect is also noticeable in the actual spectrum. The optimal way to remove the ´etalon eﬀect

and the background-gas contribution is by measuring the main and background signal in

alternating sequences at each frequency step and taking their diﬀerence.

E. Modelling the lineshapes

To analyse the VUV FM spectra, we followed the approach used by Janik et al.6 in their

measurements of the sodium D line using 2f FM spectroscopy. The signal contribution at

the k-th harmonic of the modulation frequency ωmod (1.3875 GHz) is

ω0, and ω and ω0 are the laser

and transition frequencies, respectively. In the absence of any additional broadening eﬀect,

ω0 and natural linewidth Γ .

To include the eﬀects of the laser linewidth and Doppler broadening, the calculated line

proﬁles are convoluted with Gaussian functions of appropriate widths. The widths of the

Gaussian functions needed to accurately describe the measured line shape were found to

depend on the number of pulsed valves used, which points at the fact that the propagation

directions of the diﬀerent supersonic beams are not exactly parallel.

separated using a linear time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer as already demonstrated in Ref.

36. The frequency-doubled output (532 nm) of the Nd:YAG laser was used in the ionization

step (1(cid:48)). These spectra were measured without FM and clearly reveal the expected blue-

shift of the transition frequency with increasing mass of the I = 0 isotopes (78Kr, 80Kr,

82Kr, 84Kr, 86Kr)37 and the hyperﬁne structure of the 83Kr isotope (I = 9

2). Summing the
REMPI spectra of all isotopes leads to the spectrum depicted in Fig. 7(b). The central line

in this spectrum, with a full width at half maximum of 0.015 cm−1 and a maximum at the

position of the dominant 84Kr isotope, is slightly asymmetric because of the contributions

of the other isotopes. The two weak satellite lines with full width at half maximum of

0.011 cm−1, primarily given by the laser linewidth and the Doppler broadening, originate

exclusively from the 83Kr isotope. The thick full line in the top panel in Fig. 7 represents

a simulation of the FM spectrum obtained numerically from the REMPI spectrum in panel

simulation of the FM of the spectrum of the 84Kr isotope only. The comparison of the

experimental with the two simulated spectra clearly indicates that the FM spectrum of the

isotopic mixture contains information on the isotope shifts and hyperﬁne structure although

this information is not as easy to recognize as in the REMPI spectra. The analysis of all

spectra presented in Fig. 7 leads to the spectral positions listed in Table I, which are fully

the traces correspond, from top to bottom, to the transmission spectra through the eleven

supersonic beams of pure N2 gas in the photoionization and absorption chambers ((a) and

(e)), the LIF spectra collected on the MCP detector located in the photoionization chamber

((b) and (f)) and the FM spectra recorded using demodulation phases of π

2 ((c) and (g))

and 0 ((d) and (h)), respectively.

At the nozzle stagnation pressure of 2 bar used in the experiments, the eleven skimmed

supersonic beams absorb about 25% of the VUV radiation at the position of the strongest

(R(0)) line. Under these conditions, the signal-to-noise ratio of the transmission spectrum

10) is limited by the shot-to-shot-ﬂuctuations of the VUV-laser intensity. The lineshapes

(
≈
are determined by the sideband structure generated at the two diﬀerent modulation indices.

The sideband structure is not resolved in the transmission spectrum because of the Doppler

broadening of about 1.5 GHz (FWHM) resulting from the eleven beams. Consequently, the

lines recorded at β = 1.25 have broad, ﬂat-top lineshapes and are about three times broader

than the lines recorded at β = 0.5, in which the weaker sidebands manifest themselves as

shoulders on both sides of the lines. The sideband structures are more clearly observed in

the LIF spectra because the single beam in the photoionization chamber only leads to a

Doppler broadening of 1 GHz (FWHM). The signal-to-noise ratio of the LIF spectra is much

higher (

50), despite the low collection eﬃciency (

0.7%) of the ﬂuorescence imposed by

≈

≈

the small solid-angle of the detection, because of the background-free nature of LIF.

The FM spectra are also characterized by a high signal-to-noise ratio (between 40 and

60) which represents an improvement by a factor of more than 5 over the transmission

spectrum. The lineshapes correspond exactly to the lineshapes calculated using Eq. (1) for

a Lorentzian linewidth (FWHM) of 0.05(1) cm−1, after convolution with a Gaussian line

proﬁle with FWHM of 0.14 cm−1. The highest signal-to-noise ratio (

60) is obtained by

2f modulation in combination with a demodulation phase of π

2 . The positions of the three

Lorentzian lineshapes with FWHM of 0.05(1) cm−1, corresponding to a lifetime of about

106(21) ps, which we attribute to predissociation. This lifetime is shorter than the laser

0.1 mm2) saturates

the strong transitions. The transmission spectra have a signal-to-noise ratio of about 3.

be exactly reproduced using Eq. (1) and convolution with a Gaussian lineshape function

(1)) is 0.3 cm−1, which is much larger than the natural linewidth of the 6s(cid:48)[1/2]1 level

because of saturation. The broad lines are also the reason why the signal-to-noise ratio of the

FM spectra is only slightly higher than that of the transmission spectrum. Indeed, maximal

contrast and sensitivity is reached in FM spectroscopy when the modulation frequency is

larger than the linewidth of the transition (see Fig. 1).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we have presented an extension of FM spectroscopy to the VUV range of

the electromagnetic spectrum. This extension enables the recording of absorption spectra in

the range between 200 nm and 60 nm using table-top pulsed VUV lasers based on resonance-

enhanced four-wave mixing. The attractive features of FM spectroscopy in the VUV are

(i) its high sensitivity, which results from its background-free nature and the fact that the

signal-to-noise ratio is not limited by shot-to-shot ﬂuctuations of the VUV laser intensity;

(ii) the sensitivity is suﬃciently high that spectra of cold samples in skimmed supersonic

beams can be recorded with high signal-to-noise ratio under conditions where no signiﬁcant

attenuation of the VUV radiation can be detected; (iii) the ease with which it can be

combined with other detection methods such as LIF, photoionization mass spectrometry

and (1 + 1(cid:48)) REMPI spectroscopy to characterize the photophysical processes resulting from

the absorption of short-wavelength radiation, and (iv) its high resolution, which results from

the intrinsically narrow bandwidth of Fourier-transform-limited pulsed VUV lasers. Its main

drawback is that very broad spectral features or absorption continua cannot be detected as

sensitively as sharp spectral features.

To illustrate the principles of FM spectroscopy in the VUV, we have presented absorption,

LIF, and (1 + 1(cid:48)) REMPI spectra of Ar, Kr and N2 near 82.5 nm and 92 nm. Optimal

sensitivity was reached for modulation frequencies between 1 GHz and 2 GHz in combination

with a modulation index of 1.25, which maximizes the intensity of the ﬁrst modulation

sidebands, and demodulation at twice the modulation frequency (2f) and a demodulation

phase of φ = π

2 . This large modulation index can lead to a broadening of the spectral lines
when the linewidths of the transitions exceed the modulation frequency. In this case, it can

be more advantageous to use a modulation index of 0.5 in combination with 1f demodulation

at φ = π
2 .
