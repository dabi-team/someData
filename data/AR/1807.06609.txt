PRINCIPALLY-INJECTIVE LEAVITT PATH
ALGEBRAS OVER ARBITRARY GRAPHS

SOUMITRA DAS AND ARDELINE M. BUHPHANG*

Abstract. A ring R is called right principally-injective if every R-

homomorphism f : aR −→ R, a ∈ R, extends to R, or equivalently,

if every system of equations xa = b (a, b ∈ R) is solvable in R. In

this paper we show that for any arbitrary graph E and for a ﬁeld K,

principally-injective conditions for the Leavitt path algebra LK(E)

are equivalent to that the graph E being acyclic. We also show that

the principally-injective Leavitt path algebras are precisely the von

Neumann regular Leavitt path algebras.

1. Introduction

All the rings that we consider here are assumed to be associative

with local units (such as the Leavitt path algebras).

One of the fascinating direction to study in Leavitt path algebras is

the characterization of the ring-theoretic properties of a Leavitt path

algebra LK(E) in terms of the graph-theoretic properties of the graph

E (see chapter 4 [1]). This motivates us to study Principally-injective

Leavitt path algebras.

Recall that a ring R is locally unital if for each ﬁnite set F of elements

of R, there is an idempotent u (i.e u2 = u ∈ R) such that ua = au = a

for all a ∈ F . The set of all such idempotents u is said to be a set

of local units. A ring R is said to be (von Neumann) regular if each

a ∈ R satisﬁes a ∈ aRa. The von Neumann regular Leavitt path al-

gebras LK(E) of arbitrary graphs E over a ﬁeld K were characterized

in [2] in terms of the graphical properties of E, namely, the graphs E

must have no cycles.

For a subset X of a ring R (not necessarily unital), the set

rR(X) = {t ∈ R : xt = 0 ∀x ∈ X} is right annihilator of X. The left

annihilator lR(X) is also deﬁned in a similar fashion for X ⊆ R. It

is straightforward to check that rR(X) is a right and lR(X) is a left

ideal of R. A ring R is called right principally injective (P-injective) if

every R-homomorphism f : aR −→ R, a ∈ R, extends to g : R −→ R

or equivalently, if every system of equations xa = b (a, b ∈ R) has a

solution x in R (see Proposition 3.17[6]). Thus every right self-injective

ring is right P-injective. We shall see in Lemma 3.1 that the following

are equivalent for a (locally unital) ring R (i) R is right P-injective

(ii) lRrR(a) = Ra for all a ∈ R. We note in Lemma 3.3 that every

(locally unital) regular ring R is both right and left P-injective. As

consequences we will prove in Theorem 3.8 that every regular Leavitt

path algebra LK(E) is regular iﬀ LK(E) is P -injective iﬀ the graph E

contains no cycle.

For the other deﬁnitions in this note, we refer to [8], [6]and [4].

2. Preliminaries

We recall the fundamental terminology for our note which can be

ﬁnd in the text [1]. For the sake of completeness, we shall outline some

of the concepts and results that we will be using. A (directed) graph

E = (E0; E1; r; s) consists of two sets E0 and E1 together with maps

PRINIPALLY-INJECTIVITY LEAVITT PATH ALGEBRAS OVER ARBITRARY GRAPHS3

r, s : E1 −→ E0. The elements of E0 are called vertices and the ele-

ments of E1 edges. For each e ∈ E1, r(e) is the range of e and s(e) is

the source of e. If r(e) = v and s(e) = w, then we say that v emits e

and that w receives e. A vertex v is called a sink if it emits no edges

and a vertex v is called a regular vertex if it emits a non-empty ﬁnite

set of edges. An inf inite emitter is a vertex which emits inﬁnitely
many edges. For each e ∈ E1, we call e∗ a ghost edge. We let r(e∗)
denote s(e), and we let s(e∗) denote r(e). A path µ of length n (cid:13) 0 is

a ﬁnite sequence of edges µ = e1e2 · · · en with r(ei) = s(ei+1) for all
i = 1, · · ·, n − 1. In this case µ∗ = e∗

1 is the corresponding ghost

n · · · e∗

2e∗

path. A vertex is considered a path of length 0. For a vertex v, we
deﬁne v∗ = v. The set of all vertices on the path µ is denoted by µ0.

The set of all paths in E is denoted by Path(E). A path µ = e1e2......en

in E is closed if r(en) = s(en), in which case µ is said to be based at

the vertex s(e1). A closed path µ as above is called simple provided

it does not pass through its base more than once, i.e., s(ei) 6= s(e1)

for all i = 2, ..., n. The closed path µ is called a cycle if it does not

pass through any of its vertices twice, that is, if s(ei) 6= s(ej) for every

i 6= j.

Given an arbitrary graph E and a ﬁeld K, the Leavitt path algebra

LK(E) is deﬁned to be the K-algebra generated by a set {v : v ∈ E0}

of pair-wise orthogonal idempotents together with a set of variables
{e, e∗ : e ∈ E1} which satisfy the following conditions:

(1) s(e)e = e = er(e) for all e ∈ E1.
(2) r(e)e∗ = e∗ = e∗s(e) for all e ∈ E1.
(3) (The CK-1 relations) For all e, f ∈ E1, e∗e = r(e) and
e∗f = 0 if e 6= f .

(4) (The CK-2 relations) For every regular vertex v ∈ E0,

A useful observation is that every element a of LK(E) can be written

in the form a = Pn

i=1 kiαiβ∗

i , where ki ∈ K, αi, βi are paths in E and

n is a suitable integer.

We mention two basic examples:

(1) If E is the graph having one vertex and a single loop

c

•v

then LK(E) ∼= K[x, x−1], the Laurent polynomial K-algebra via

v 7−→ 1, c 7−→ x and c∗ 7−→ x−1.

(2) If E is the oriented n-line graph having n vertices and n−1 edges

then LK(E) ∼= Mn(K), via vi 7−→ fi,i, ei 7−→ fi,i+1 and e∗

7−→ fi+1,i,

where {fi,j : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} denotes the standard matrix units in Mn(K).

3. Results

We shall need the following lemmas.

3.1. Lemma. (cf. Lemma 5.1 [8]) The following conditions are equiv-

alent for a locally unital ring R:

(i) R is right P-injective.

(ii) lRrR(a) = Ra for all a ∈ R.

Proof. (i) =⇒ (ii) For any z ∈ rR(a), az = 0. This implies that

a ∈ lR(z), ∀z ∈ rR(a), yielding Ra ⊆ lRrR(a). Let x ∈ lRrR(a). Then,

PRINIPALLY-INJECTIVITY LEAVITT PATH ALGEBRAS OVER ARBITRARY GRAPHS5

rR(a) ⊆ rR(x). Deﬁne f : aR → R by f (at) = xt. This is well-deﬁned
as at = at′ implies that a(t − t′) = 0, that is (t − t′) ∈ rR(a) ⊆ rR(x).
So, f (at) = xt = xt′ = f (at′). By (i), there exist g : R → R such that

f (a) = g(a) = g(ua) = g(u)a ∈ Ra, where u is the local unit for a.

Hence lRrR(a) = Ra.

(ii) =⇒ (i) Let f : aR → R, a ∈ R, be R-linear. Then f (a) = d, for

some d ∈ R. We show that d ∈ Ra. Take x ∈ rR(a). Then 0 = f (ax) =

f (a)x = dx, so, rR(a) ⊆ rR(d). This implies that lRrR(d) ⊆ lRrR(a).

So, d ∈ lRrR(a) = Ra, therefore, d ∈ Ra. Hence f (a) = d = ca for

some c ∈ R. Deﬁne g : R → R by g(x) = cx. Then g is the required

extension of f on R.

(cid:3)

Before deriving the next lemma, we insert a remark here.

3.2. Remark. For the graph E =

c

•v

the corresponging Leavitt path algebra R = LK(E) is not right (left)
P-injective can be seen as follows: c∗ ∈ lRrR(v − c) but c∗ /∈ R(v − c).

Thus lRrR(v − c) 6= R(v − c).

3.3. Lemma. Let R be a locally unital ring. If R is (von Neumann)

regular then R is right (left) P-injective.

Proof. Always, Ra ⊆ lRrR(a) for any a ∈ R. To see lRrR(a) ⊆ Ra.

Let us take x ∈ lRrR(a), then rR(a) ⊆ rR(x). Write a = ara for some

r ∈ R and choose v a local unit of x. Then (v − ra)va ∈ rR(a) ⊆ rR(x).

This shows that x = xrava ∈ Ra. The result now follows by Lemma

3.1.

(cid:3)

Recall that a ring R is said to be semiprime if, for every ideal I of

R, I 2 = 0 implies I = 0.

6

SOUMITRA DAS AND ARDELINE M. BUHPHANG*

3.4. Lemma. (cf. Lemma 4.3.4 [1]) Let R be a locally unital ring which

is semiprime and right P-injective. Then for every idempotent e ∈ R,

the corner eRe is right P-injective.

Proof. Write S = eRe and let x ∈ lSrS(a), where x, a ∈ S. Then

rS(a) ⊆ rS(x). By Lemma 3.1, it suﬃces to show that rR(a) ⊆ rR(x)

(then x ∈ Ra, so x = ex ∈ eRa = Sa, as required). So let y ∈ rR(a),

then ay = 0 ⇒ aey = 0 ⇒ aeyke = 0, ∀k ∈ R ⇒ xeyke = 0, ∀k ∈ R

(since rS(a) ⊆ rS(x)). Thus, xyRe = 0 and exy = xy. Now consider

the two-sided ideal RxyR of R, and note that (RxyR)2 ⊆ RxyRxyR ⊆

RxyRexyR = {0}. But R is semiprime and hence RxyR = {0} imply-

ing that xy = 0 as R has local units. This completes the proof.

(cid:3)

Recall that a ring is a right PP ring if every principal right ideal is

projective.

It is worth mentioning that a ring R without identity may

not be a projective R-module. But a Leavitt path algebra over an ar-

bitrary graph is always projective as a module over itself (see Corollary

2.3 [4]).

We use a part of Lemma 8 [5] and note the following lemma.

3.5. Lemma. (cf. Example 5.8.

[8]) Let R be a locally unital ring

which is semiprime. If R is right P-injective, right PP ring then R is

(von Neumann) regular.

Proof. Let a be any element in R with u a local unit of a . Since R

is a right PP ring, aR is projective and so the short exact sequence

0 → rR(a) → R → aR → 0 splits. Writing S = uRu and arguing as

in Lemma 8 [5] we get that the following short exact sequence 0 →

PRINIPALLY-INJECTIVITY LEAVITT PATH ALGEBRAS OVER ARBITRARY GRAPHS7

rS(a) → S → aS → 0 splits. Thus, rS(a) = eS, where e2 = e ∈ S.

Hence, (by Lemma 3.1) Sa = lSrS(a) = S(u − e). Now Sa ⊕ Se = S
(cid:3)

implies that a ∈ aRa.

Before stating our main theorem, we shall recall few more lemmas.

3.6. Lemma. (see Proposition 2.3.1 [1]) Let E be an arbitrary graph

and K be any ﬁeld. Then the Leavitt path algebra LK(E) is semiprime.

3.7. Lemma. (see Theorem 3.7. [3]) Let E be an arbitrary graph and

K be any ﬁeld. Then every one-sided ideal of LK(E) is projective.

We are now in a position to show that every right (or left) P-injective

Leavitt path algebras are (von Neumann) regular.

3.8. Theorem. Let E be an arbitrary graph and K be any ﬁeld. Then

the following are equivalent.

(1) LK(E) is right (left) P-injective

(2) LK(E) is von Neumann regular.

(3) E is acyclic (i.e contains no cycle).

(4) LK(E) is locally K-matricial.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) Follows from Lemma 3.6, Lemma 3.7 and Lemma 3.5.

(2) ⇒ (1) Follows from Lemma 3.3. The equivalence of (2), (3) and

(4) can be seen in Theorem 3.4.1 [1].
