ABSTRACT

A light bridge is a prominent structure commonly observed within a sunspot. Its presence usually
triggers a wealth of dynamics in a sunspot, and has a lasting impact on sunspot evolution. However,
the fundamental structure of light bridges is still not well understood.
In this study, we used the
high-resolution spectropolarimetry data obtained by the Solar Optical Telescope onboard the Hinode
satellite to analyze the magnetic and thermal structure of a light bridge at AR 12838. We also combined
the high-cadence 1700 ˚A channel data provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the
Solar Dynamic Observatory to study the dynamics on this bridge. We found that a pair of blue
and red Doppler shift patches at two ends of this bridge, this pattern appears to be the convective
motion directed by the horizontal component of the magnetic ﬁeld aligned with the spine of this
bridge. Paired upward and downward motions implies that the light bridge could have a two-legged
or undulate magnetic ﬁeld. Signiﬁcant four minute oscillations in the emission intensity of the 1700 ˚A
bandpass were detected at two ends, which had overlap with the paired blue and red shift patches.
The oscillatory signals at the light bridge and the penumbra were highly correlated with each other.
Although they are separated in space at the photosphere, the periodicity seems to have a common
origin from the underneath. Therefore, we infer that the light bridge and penumbra could share a
common magnetic source and become fragmented at the photosphere by magneto-convection.

1. INTRODUCTION

A light bridge is an elongated bright structure that
crosses a sunspot umbra or deeply penetrates into it
(Muller 1979). This type of structure is usually found
in a nascent or decaying spot, or when two spots merge
into one or the inverse process occurs. At these stages,
magneto-convection causes signiﬁcant ﬂux separation in
deeper layers of a spot or pore, and this phenomenon

could be accompanied by the formation of light bridges
and umbral dots at the photosphere (Bharti et al. 2007a;
Rempel 2011; Toriumi et al. 2015a). Light bridges could
aﬀect the evolution of sunspots, e.g., split or merge, they
consequently determine the level of solar activities indi-
rectly.

According to Sobotka (1997), a light bridge is classi-
ﬁed either as a granular bridge if it exhibits photospheric
dynamics, or a ﬁlamentary bridge if it is an intrusion of
penumbra. Further classiﬁcation is termed either as a
strong light bridge if it separates the umbra, or otherwise
a faint light bridge if it simply protrudes into the umbra.
In the following text, we use “spine” to refer the elon-

gated central column of a light bridge. Two “ends” are
a bridge’s shorter edges, which normally have a length
of a few arcsec, and two “ﬂanks” are the longer edges,
which usually has a length scale comparable with the
umbra.

A light bridge is believed to be hotter than the um-
bra, as convection (granulations) are partially or fully
restored therein (Rouppe van der Voort et al. 2010).
Convection could act as an eﬀective mechanism to sup-
ply hotter gas to the light bridge. Hot and dense
plasma is pushed upwards at the spine of a bridge and
moves downwards at its two ﬂanks (Lagg et al. 2014).
Strong downﬂow would drag the magnetic ﬁeld lines
and could even lead to polarity reversal in extreme cases
(Bharti et al. 2007b).

The magnetic ﬁeld of a light bridge is more inclined
than the vertical umbral ﬁeld; a magnetic canopy model
is proposed for light bridge (Jurˇc´ak et al. 2006). Strong
discontinuity is found at the interface between a light
bridge and the umbra, therefore, strong electric cur-
rent density could be detected at the edge of a bridge
(Shimizu 2011; Toriumi et al. 2015a,b).

Many dynamic activities are detected at light bridges,
as light bridge has a magnetic and thermal structure
in contrast with that of the umbra. Louis et al. (2014)
found that dynamic jets usually originate from one ﬂank
of a bridge and propagate along the open magnetic
ﬁeld lines. According to the asymmetry in jet exci-
tation, Yuan & Walsh (2016) proposed a three dimen-
sional model for a light bridge: the magnetic ﬁeld at one
ﬂank is mostly aligned with umbral ﬁeld, whereas at the
other ﬂank the two magnetic ﬁelds are more close to
anti-parallel. In this scenario, magnetic reconnections,
which are believed to be the driver of jets (Moore et al.
2010), could only be triggered at one ﬂank.

Robustini et al. (2016) and Tian et al. (2018) de-
tected inverted Y-shaped jets above sunspot light
bridges, this morphology supports the model of ﬂux
emergence in the vertical umbral magnetic ﬁeld, the
collimated jets and surges are propelled by the recon-
nections between anti-parallel magnetic ﬁeld lines. This
kind of activities are also reported by a number of stud-
ies (Bharti et al. 2017; Bai et al. 2019).

A sunspot is usually a host of waves and oscilla-
tions.
In the umbra, the oscillation period is about
three minutes, whereas in the penumbra, a dominant
oscillation could be found at ﬁve minute bandpass
(Khomenko & Collados 2015). Above a light bridge, ﬁve
minute oscillations similar to penumbra oscillations are
usually detected, however, its origin is still not revealed
yet (Yuan et al. 2014; Yuan & Walsh 2016; Yang et al.
2015).

In this study, a tiny light bridge is formed in the center
of the umbra, the ambient magnetic ﬁeld is very simple,
this situation hence allows a decent investigation of light
bridge properties with negligible contamination of other
structures. In Section 2, we presents data reduction and
analysis. Then we cover the structure and dynamics on
this light bridge in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss
a possible structure of light bridge with the knowledge
obtained in this study.

2. DATA REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS

On 10 and 11 April 2019, a penumbral ﬁlament pro-
truded into the umbra of AR 12838 and formed a faint
light bridge (see Figure 1). This light bridge detached
from the penumbral ﬁlament and evolved into a com-
pact and isolated structure on 12 and 13 April. From 14
April and thereafter, the light bridge became more dif-
fuse and eventually decayed oﬀ. This light bridge was
clearly visible in the 1700 ˚A, 1600 ˚A, and visible light
(4500 ˚A) channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA, Lemen et al. 2012) onboard the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) from 10 to 15 April 2019.

SDO/AIA observes the full solar disk continuously
with nine ﬁlters in ultra violet (UV) and extreme UV
(EUV) bandpasses. One AIA pixel correspond to an an-
gular width of 0.6 arcsec or a distance of about 435 km
on the sun. The UV channels take an image of the Sun
every 24 s, whereas the EUV images have a cadence of
about 12 s.

The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on-
board SDO observes the full solar disk at 6173 ˚A, one
pixel corresponds to 0.5 arcsec. The line-of-sight mag-
netogram has a cadence of about 45 s.

The AIA UV and EUV data were calibrated with the
standard procedure provided by the SolarSoft1. The
digital oﬀset of the cameras, CCD read-out noise and
dark current were removed from the data, then each
image was corrected with a ﬂat-ﬁeld and was normalized
with its exposure time.

The spectro-polarimeter (SP) of the Solar Optical
Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode mission measured
high-precision Stokes polarimetric line proﬁles of the
Fe I 6301.5 ˚A and 6302.5 ˚A spectral lines. The fast-
mapping mode was used to scan the entire sunspot and
its surrounding area. Each pixel represented an angular
width of about 0.32′′; the spectral sampling was about
21.549 m˚A per pixel. Two consecutive slit scan had a
step size of about 0.30′′.

We obtained SOT/SP level-2 data from Community
Spectro-polarimetric Analysis Center (CSAC2). This
dataset has undergone the standard CCD image cali-
bration. The Stokes parameters were used to derive
the magnetic ﬁeld vector and ﬂow ﬁeld by assuming
the Milne-Eddington Atmosphere model (see review by
del Toro Iniesta & Ruiz Cobo 2016). The 180◦ ambigu-
ity of the azimuth angle of magnetic ﬁeld was resolved
with the AZAM utility (Lites et al. 1995). The SP im-
ages were aligned with the AIA UV images by matching
the center of the light bridge. The vertical electric cur-
rent density (jz) were computed by using the inverted
vector magnetic ﬁeld, jz = µ−1
0 (∇ × B)z, where µ0
stands for the magnetic permeability in free space. The
Doppler shift was obtained by the inversion of Stokes
vector.

We extracted the emission intensity variations of the
1700 ˚A channel from a pixel in the umbra and another
one at the light bridge (Figure 2d). These two time se-
ries were detrended by removing the ten minutes mov-
ing average; the wavelet spectra were calculated with
the Morlet mother function (Torrence & Compo 1998).
The detrended emission intensity variations and wavelet
spectra are plotted in Figure 3 for both cases of light
bridge and umbra. We see that an oscillatory signal
with a period of about two minutes was detected in the
umbra (Figure 3b), whereas the light bridge exhibited a
four minute oscillation (Figure 3d).

To study the spatial distribution of four minute os-
cillations, we performed Fourier transform to the de-
trended emission intensity of every pixel in the AIA
1700 ˚A and averaged the Fourier power among the spec-
tral components between three and ﬁve minutes. Figure
4a plots the narrowband Fourier power with four minute
spectral peak above 3σ noise level. The noise level was
estimated by assuming the white noise in the times se-
ries as formulated in Torrence & Compo (1998).

We also analyzed the correlation between the four
minute oscillations at the light bridge and those at the
penumbra. For every pixel, the detrended emission in-
tensity was transformed into the Fourier space, then a
narrow band spectrum was selected by multiplying a
uniform window between three to ﬁve minute. There-
after, a ﬁltered signal in time domain was formed by do-
ing inverse Fourier transform. A reference signal was es-
timated by averaging the signals within the light bridge
(within the island as enclosed by the inner contour in
Figure 4). We calculated the cross-correlation between
the signal of every pixel and the reference signal, the

maximum cross-correlation coeﬃcient and lag time for
each pixel were obtained by ﬁnding the argument max-
imum. These two values were plotted in Figure 4b-4c.

Similar analysis was done for the two minute band-
pass (two to three minutes range), the Fourier power,
cross-correlation coeﬃcient, and lag time distributions
are shown in Figure 4d-4f.

3. STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF THE LIGHT

BRIDGE

3.1. Suppression of coronal loop formation

Figure 1 presents the evolution of this sunspot and
the associated active region AR 12838 with expanding
coronal loops. An interesting feature is that on the 10th
and 11th April 2019 this light bridge was anchored at
the north-west part of the penumbra (Figure 1(a1-a2)),
no coronal loops were rooted at that part (Figure 1(c1-
c2)). In contrast to this, after the bridge gradually de-
tached from the penumbra, the coronal loops started to
form again (Figure 1(c4-c6)).
It appears that such a
light bridge suppressed the formation of coronal loops
above the part of umbra where it has rooted. We spot-
ted that at the region where the light bridge was rooted,
the strength and inclination angle of the magnetic ﬁeld
deviated from the other part of the penumbra (Figure
2(b-c)). This part seems to have mixed polarity in con-
trast to the negative polarity at the umbra (see the part
pointed by a blue arrow in Figure 2b).

3.2. Thermal and magnetic structure

In this section and thereafter, we focus on the compact
and segmented light bridge on 13 April 2019 (Figure
1b4). This structure could stand clear oﬀ the inﬂuence of
complex dynamics, as its size was small and its magnetic
structure might reveal the fundamental structure of a
light bridge.

Figure 2 illustrates the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld
and Doppler shift obtained by inversion of SOT/SP
Stokes vector. We could see that, in the continuum in-
tensity at λ6301.5 ˚A and the emission intensity of AIA
1700 ˚A, the elementary light bridge formed a compact
bright island within umbra core (Figure 2a and 2d).
Its LOS magnetic ﬁeld component Bz was as weak as
−1400 G, about half the strength of umbral ﬁeld (about
−3000 G). This variation was very sharp (about 1500 G)
and this was detected within a span of about 3′′ (or
about 2, 000 km) across the bridge (Figure 2b). Along
the elongated spine of the bridge, the variation of LOS
magnetic component was much smaller (about 500 G).
This fact also holds in the inclination angle of the mag-
netic ﬁeld vector: along the spine, the inclination angle
did not vary signiﬁcantly, whereas across the spine we

4

Feng et. al.

In Figure 2f, we observed red shift at the northern
penumbra, its magnitude was about 1 km · s−1. This
means that ﬂuid moved downwards to the sunspot.
The Doppler shift was about 1 km · s−1 at the outer
edge of penumbra, this value was stronger than that
at the penumbra-umbra interface. This is a clear pat-
tern of Evershed ﬂow (Evershed 1909), which could
be caused by overturning magneto-convective motion
guided by the magnetic ﬁeld lines (Rimmele & Marino
2006; Siu-Tapia et al. 2018). The umbra was also over-
whelmed by red shift; at the bridge, there was two re-
gions with ﬂows either stronger or weaker than the back-
ground red shift. After removing the background red
shift (about 0.6 km · s−1), we observed paired patches of
red and blue shifts on the Western and Eastern ends of
this light bridge (Figure 2f, zoomed view), their veloci-
ties were about ±0.3 km · s−1.

3.3. Oscillations

Within the umbral core, we could see that the emis-
sion intensity exhibited a persistent oscillatory signal at
about two minutes, see Figure 3. This oscillatory sig-
nal could be found within the whole umbra core, this
is consistent with previous studies (Yuan et al. 2014;
Yuan & Walsh 2016; Jess et al. 2016). The umbral os-
cillation power at two minutes became deplete at the
light bridge. The cross-correlation of the two minute
band was very low within the umbra (Figure 4e and 4f).
At the light bridge, the emission intensity varied pe-
riodically at about four minutes (Figure 3). This four
minutes signal ﬁlled the light bridge (Figure 4a). This is
consistent with earlier studies (Yuan et al. 2014). Two
patches of strong oscillation power were measured at two
ends of the bridge. This pattern overlapped with the
paired regions with red and blue Doppler shift. Within
the bridge, the cross-correlation was very strong, the
high-correlation region was found over the whole bridge
(Figure 4b). The lag time of the four minute oscillation
was close to zero within the bridge (Figure 4c).

At the penumbra, similar four minutes oscillations
were detected, the strong oscillation power was found to
be distributed along the umbra-penumbra border. This
is a commonly observed feature in sunspots (Yuan et al.
2014; Yuan & Walsh 2016). This oscillatory signal was
separate in space from the light bridge oscillation (Fig-
ure 4a). However, we notice that the four minutes oscil-
lations at the penumbra and the light bridge had strong
correlation (Figure 4b). As a contrast, the two min-
utes umbral oscillations had very weak correlation be-
tween any two locations (Figure 4e). The lag time at
the penumbra could be either positive or negative, re-
gions with same lag time tended to form patches in sizes

could discern that inclination angle at two ﬂanks devi-
ated by about 30 deg (or about 0.15π, see Figure 2c).
The electric current density was strong at the northern
end of the bridge, but no clear pattern was discernible.

of a few arc seconds (Figure 4c), it means that the four
minute oscillation within the same patch could originate
from a common oscillatory source from the underneath.

4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this letter, we used the joint observations of
SDO/AIA and Hinode/SOT on AR 12838, and studied
the long term evolution of a light bridge, its magnetic
and thermal structures, and the oscillations of emission
intensity. With a wealth of observables, we aim to infer
the origin and structure of this light bridge.

The light bridge appears to suppress the formation
of coronal loops at the region where it is connected to
the penumbra. The region rooted by the light bridge
have mixed polarity in contrast to the umbral ﬁeld, this
would means that the umbral ﬁeld could connect to this
polarity, rather than expand radially and form coronal
loops.

On the 13 April 2019, this bridge detached from the
penumbra. A pair of red and blue shift regions were
found at its two ends; whereas this whole structure was
submerged within a global red shift. The paired patches
of blue and red shift indicated upward and downward
motion of plasma along the line of sight. The radiative
MHD simulations of Rempel (2011) and Toriumi et al.

(2015a) suggest that magneto-convections could be
guided by strong inclined magnetic ﬁeld and plays a
key role in triggering the dynamics above the light
bridge. The paired patches of blue and red Doppler
shifts detected in this study implies that this light bridge
has a strong horizontal magnetic ﬁeld component along
its spine and directed the magneto-convection motions
along its elongated part. This eﬀect has also been
observed in cool loops (Bethge et al. 2012), emerging
magnetic ﬂux tube (Requerey et al. 2017), and sunspot
umbra (Kleint & Dalda 2013; Guglielmino et al. 2017;
Guglielmino et al. 2019).

Within the umbra of AR 12838 in this study, the
emission intensity oscillate with a period of about
two minute; however this oscillatory signal disappeared
above the light bridge. As a contrast, this light bridge
was a host of four minute oscillation in the emission in-
tensity. Moreover, this periodicity is commonly found
at the penumbra. So it appears that the four minute
oscillation at the light bridge and that at the penum-
bra has a common origin, as they were highly corre-
lated. If a light bridge is transported to the surface by
magneto-convection (Toriumi et al. 2015a), its magnetic
ﬁeld could converge with that of the penumbra at a cer-

(Rempel 2011; Toriumi et al. 2015a). With the ﬂow pat-
tern and oscillations, we could get an insight into the
internal structure and formation of a light bridge, we
should note that this light bridge only represents one
kind, more cases are needed to probe the general struc-
ture of light bridges and investigate their inﬂuence on
the dynamics and evolution of sunspots and pores.

tain depth underneath the sunspot. That region could
be the source of the four minutes periodicity.

Here, we summarize the knowledge obtained within
this letter. A pair of blue and red shift regions indi-
cates that two ends of this light bridge are connected
by a strong horizontal ﬁeld. The paired upward and
downward motions imply that this light bridge has two-
legged or undulate magnetic ﬁeld.
If one end of this
light bridge is rooted at the penumbra, it would suppress
the formation of coronal loop at the anchor region. The
four minute oscillation at the light bridge is highly cor-
related with that at the penumbra, it indicates that the
light bridge and penumbra structure could be connected
at a certain depth under the surface, they could have
the same origin from a sub-surface magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux
and become fragmented by magneto-convective motions
