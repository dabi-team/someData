Abstract. K-line proﬁles emitted from a warm dense plasma environment are
used for diagnostics of Ar droplet plasmas created by high energy laser pulses [1].
Analyzing the temporally and spacially integrated spectra, we infer temperature
gradients within the Ar droplet from cold temperatures of the order of some
10 eV up to higher temperatures of 250 eV and beyond. To characterize the
inﬂuence of the warm and dense environment on the emitters, plasma screening
is considered within a perturbative approach to the Hamiltonian. The plasma
aﬀects the many-particle system resulting in energy shifts of emission as well as
ionization energies due to electron-ion and electron-electron interaction. With
this approach we get a good reproduction of spectral features that are strongly
inﬂuenced by ionization and excitation processes within the plasma. Comparing
with the widely known FLYCHK code and the temperature distribution given in
the original paper [1], counting for internal degrees of freedom (bound states) and
treating pressure ionization within our quantum statistical approach results in a
more detailed temperature-density-relation and leads to diﬀerent results for the
inferred temperature distribution.

Kα Proﬁles of Warm Dense Ar

1. Introduction

2

Plasma diagnostics using Kα ﬂuorescence spectra allows to investigate properties of
warm dense matter. This work focuses on the bulk temperature distribution of plasmas
created from Ar droplets irradiated by high energy laser pulses with a power of 1019
W/cm2 [1]. Due to the high intensity, matter at temperatures between some 10 eV to
250 eV (bulk) and up to 1 MeV (blow-oﬀ) is created. Most of the atoms are ionized
and a wide range of diﬀerent ion species is observed.

The atomic density of the Ar droplet is ntot = 2.2 × 1022 cm−3. Accordingly, free
electron densities vary between 1022 −1024 cm−3 depending on the degree of ionization
of the Ar plasma. Due to laser plasma interaction the argon plasma radiates Kα lines
with emission energies at about 3 keV, which can be used straightforwardly to infer
the plasma parameters. To propagate through the plasma, radiation frequencies have
(cid:15)0m , where ne is the density
to be larger than the plasma frequency ωplasma =
and m is the mass of free electrons [2]. Considering the expected high free electron
densities, x-rays (like the Kα-lines) are needed to investigate the created plasmas.

(cid:113) nee2

To describe the plasma microscopically, including its emission spectra, one has to
consider in detail the inﬂuence of the environment on the ionic potential, the electron-
electron and the electron-ion interaction [3]. To introduce plasma eﬀects, the electron-
ion plasma screening is described within an ion sphere model approximation [3] and the
electron-electron plasma screening is described within a quantum statistical approach
by the Montroll-Ward self-energy contribution. To understand the Kα emissions,
which correspond to an electron going from a 2p to an 1s level, also the ﬁne structure
of the emitting states has to be taken into account. Moreover, the creation of inner
(K-) shell vacancies is accompanied by ionization and excitation of outer shell electrons
(L- and M-shell) resulting in additional satellite lines. The emission energies of the
satellites signiﬁcantly increase with the number of vacancies and excited states. The
intensity ratio of diﬀerent lines is determined according to their statistical weight
(LS coupling) and the abundance of the corresponding emitter species in dependence
on the plasma parameters. Using coupled Saha equations, we consider the diﬀerent
charge states in thermodynamic equilibrium [2]. Finally, we add Lorentz proﬁles and
convolute with a Gaussian instrument function to calculate synthetic spectra from the
plasma shifted emission energies.

We compare our results with the experimental data presented in [1] as well as with
theoretical results obtained with the FLYCHK code, also given in [1]. FLYCHK[4, 5, 6]
provides emission spectra and ionization distributions within plasmas by solving rate
equations for level populations considering collisional and radiative atomic processes.
The code is well benchmarked for long-pulse laser experiments. However, there can
appear jumps in the density of nearly neutral ion species if bound states are pressure
ionized. When constructing synthetic X-ray spectra, line components that involve
vanishing states have to be removed by hand if there is no steady fade out of its
contribution with respect to the plasma parameters[7]. We apply an approach where
pressure ionized states shift steadily into the continuum and no extra treatment is
needed [8, 9].

2. Unperturbed emitter

3

To describe the inﬂuence of a plasma environment on an emitter, a perturbative
ansatz, H = H0 + H (cid:48), is chosen. The systems Hamiltonian H is split into a part H0
describing the isolated emitting particle and a perturbing plasma potential H (cid:48). The
isolated emitter can be described by means of atomic physics. In contrast to previous
publications, we changed and expanded the emitter conﬁgurations that are taken into
account. Previously, to determine emission and ionization energies of various ionic
conﬁgurations, we solved the corresponding self-consistent Roothaan-Hartree-Fock
equations applying the chemical ab initio code Gaussian 03, see e.g. [8, 9]. However the
calculations prevent straightforward observation of ﬁne-structure splitting and only a
very restricted number of excitation levels could be taken into account. As there are
several hundred transitions located closely together, it is common to limit the number
of levels in the calculations especially for lower charge states. FLYCHK for example
applies super-conﬁguration transition arrays, which result in eﬀective bound states and
respective transition rates [1]. However, our observations show that the details of the
energy level conﬁgurations are crucial to the determination of the plasma composition
and emission spectra. Despite the calculational eﬀorts we decided to take all tabulated
values of energy levels and emission energies into account to describe the unperturbed
particles as precisely as possible. In particular, we consider ionization for all shells
for argon (Z = 18) we apply 16 ionization stages from Ar+ to Ar16+.
but 1s, i.e.
For those ions we considered altogether 111 diﬀerent electronic conﬁgurations and 713
diﬀerent ionization energies. The latter can be found in the NIST Atomic Spectra
Database [10]. To get the diﬀerence between the two numbers across, let’s consider
an example: The ground state electronic conﬁguration of Ar+ is (1s22s22p63s23p5).
According to LS coupling we have two diﬀerent states J = 1/2 and J = 3/2 with
two diﬀerent ionization energies for the outermost electron. Another possibility is
the excited conﬁguration (1s22s22p63s23p43d1). Here we already have 28 diﬀerent
ionization energies corresponding to the diﬀerent terms from 2S to 4F and J-states
from 1/2 to 9/2. To calculate the plasma composition also the total binding energies
of the considered ions were necessary and taken from NIST as well. Moreover, we took
into account a total of 1211 diﬀerent Kα emission lines, as tabulated by Palmeri et
al. [11], to construct synthetic emission spectra. All those level and emission energies
build up the unperturbed basis to which a perturbation according to the plasma is
added as described below.

According to ﬁrst order perturbation theory, the unperturbed wave functions
If we look at single levels, e.g.
are required to calculate changes of energy levels.
in ionization processes, the energy shift is simply given by the averaging over the
perturbation H (cid:48)

∆E(1) = (cid:104)ϕval|H (cid:48)|ϕval(cid:105) .

(1)

However, when we consider shifts of emission energies two levels are involved. Then
the shift is determined by

∆E(1) = (cid:104)ϕi|H (cid:48)|ϕi(cid:105) − (cid:104)ϕf |H (cid:48)|ϕf (cid:105) .

(2)
Both equations apply the unperturbed wave functions. Whereas ϕval denotes the
wave function of the valence orbital of the electron that is ionized, ϕi and ϕf denote
the initial and ﬁnal orbitals of the emission transition, respectively. The orbital wave
functions are separated into radial orbitals Rnl(r) and spherical harmonics Ylm(θ, φ),
(3)

ϕnlm((cid:126)r) = Rnl(r) · Ylm(θ, φ) .

Kα Proﬁles of Warm Dense Ar

Further, the radial atomic orbitals are expanded as a ﬁnite superposition of Slater
orbitals. The suitable superposition can be determined self-consistently within an
iterative process to minimize the energy of Hamiltonian H0. In the following we use
the radial wave functions determined by Bunge et al. All parameters and results can
be found in detail in [12].

3. Plasma polarization

In the following we describe the determination of the perturbing Hamiltonian H (cid:48) and
calculate shifts of the energy levels caused by the surrounding charges in the plasma
environment within the approach described above. To obtain the distribution of the
free plasma electrons around the quasi-static ionic emitters, an ion sphere or conﬁned
atom model is used [8]. The ion sphere contains a nucleus of charge Z = 18 and the
respective number of electrons, so that the system in total is neutral. The electron
density inside the sphere is divided into the density of bound and free electrons, nb(r)
and nf (r) respectively. Accordingly, the radial Poisson equation for the potential φ(r)
reads

∆φ(r) = 4πe nb(r) + 4πe nf (r) − 4π Ze δ(r).

(4)

The perturbing potential is given by the diﬀerence of the sphere’s potential with and
without free plasma electrons,

H (cid:48) = −e [φ(r) − φ(r, nf = 0)] .

The free electron density is determined self-consistently,

with the minimum momentum p0 = (cid:112)2me φ(r) and the Wigner-Seitz radius R =

which is the boundary of the ion sphere. Equation (6) is obtained from the
4πne
equation of state of non-degenerate, free electrons in momentum representation. The
fraction before the integral represents a normalization factor to assure that the number
of free electrons within the sphere equals the ionic charge.

The bound electron density is given by the radial wave functions of the

unperturbed emitter,

nb(r) =

(7)

The sum (cid:80)
nl depends on the speciﬁc electronic conﬁguration of the considered ion
(every electron contributes one bound state orbital). Since the conﬁgurations of initial
and ﬁnal state of a transition diﬀer, we also obtain diﬀerent potentials φ(r) and H (cid:48) of
the ion sphere before and after the transition. For the Rnl(r) functions we take the
results of Bunge et al. [12], as described above.

The iterative calculation of φ(r) and nf (r) starts with the assumption of a
constant free electron density nf(r) = ne throughout the sphere. We solve (4) and
(6) iteratively and ﬁnally obtain a self-consistent free electron density which forms a
polarization cloud close to the nucleus and dilutes for larger radii.

Figure 1. Shift of Kα emission energy with rising temperature for two diﬀerent
electron densities and ground state ionization stages.

Due to screening caused by the free electrons close to the nucleus, the energy
levels and hence the emission and ionization energies are shifted. Our calculational
results are exemplarily shown in ﬁgures (1) and (2). We obtain emission line shifts
to lower energies (red shift) in the order of some eV depending on both the plasma
temperature kBT and the average free electron density ne. This eﬀect is referred to
as plasma polarization shift and can be explained as follows [9]: The free electrons
screen the nucleus resulting in lower absolute values of the negative binding energies.
As the 1s level is localized closer to the nucleus than 2p, it is more aﬀected by the
screening of the nucleus and thus experiences the larger shift, i.e. the gap between
the two levels narrows. Since the emission energy is given by the diﬀerence of the
two involved levels the spectral line is red shifted to lower emission energies. The red
shift increases with rising free electron density as the screening of the nucleus rises as
well. However, the red shift decreases with rising plasma temperature. This is due
to the fact that the self-consistently determined free electron density within the ion
sphere is not constant but depends on the distance to the emitter’s core. The higher
the temperature the more the screening cloud is spatially extended (’smeared out’)
and the actual free electron density close to the nucleus decreases, resulting in less
screening and a lower red shift.

Plasma polarization is not only important to calculate the accurate emission line
positions but also to determine the plasma composition. In contrast to emission lines,
a single level surrounded by plasma experiences a blue shift to higher energies when its
absolute value of the binding energy is lowered by screening, i.e. the level shifts closer
to the continuum (E = 0). Depending on the plasma parameters this shift can be
that large that the continuum is reached and the bound electron is set free (pressure
ionization, Mott eﬀect [13]). Hence, we obtain another free electron and a new ion
species. In the following we will outline, how the plasma composition is calculated
taking into account the polarization shifts we determined within the ion sphere model.

contain the particle interactions and are discussed in detail in the next paragraph.

Here, m denotes the m-th ionization stage with respect to the uncharged atom

Here, we limit ourselves to a maximum number of ionization stages suﬃcient for
temperatures we are interested in (T ≤ 250 eV) , i.e. the sum doesn’t run until 18
but is considered up to the Lithium like ion (m = 15).

Let us now consider the electronic partition function σin

not have any internal degrees of freedom, we split the partition function into the ideal
part represented by the statistical weight ge = 2 and a Boltzmann factor containing
the interaction energy ∆e,

The electron interaction energy ∆e is treated as a rigid, momentum independent quasi-
particle shift of the free particle energies and is divided into an electron-ion interaction
term and an electron-electron interaction term. According to [14] the total internal

Taking a closer look at the the internal partition functions of the ions σin
(m) we
have to consider internal degrees of freedom, i.e. diﬀerently excited bound states. The
screening due to the plasma environment leads to a shift of the ionization energies till
the bound states vanish at the Mott densities (pressure ionization)[15, 13]. To avoid
discontinuities due to pressure ionization, we apply a Planck-Larkin renormalization
to the internal partition function [14]. It than reads for the m-th ionization stage as

Keeping the total density ﬁxed at the bulk value of ntot = 2.2 × 1022 cm−3 we
calculate the abundance of diﬀerent ion species (ﬁgure (3)) and the corresponding
average charge state (solid line in ﬁgure (4)) depending on the plasma temperature.
We compare our results for the charge state distribution with results of Neumayer et
al. obtained from the FLYCHK code [1] (dashed line in ﬁgure (4)). We see a sharp rise
of the charge state and a rapid sequence of ionization stages are passed through for
temperatures below 50 eV. This is the regime of M-shell ionization, binding energies are
rather low and pressure ionization plays an important role. Comparing with FLYCHK,

Kα Proﬁles of Warm Dense Ar

at the same temperature our calculations give not only a higher charge state but also
larger energy shifts of the emission energies in this regime. For temperatures above 50
eV, where the L-shell ionization regime sets in, our results swing back to the FLYCHK
results and oscillate around the graph.

The diﬀerences in ﬁgure (4) arise from the diﬀerent treatment of the variety of
bound states and pressure ionization within the approaches. As there are several
hundred transitions closely distributed for lower charge states usually a simpliﬁcation
is applied for better handling. FLYCHK uses super-conﬁguration transition arrays
(eﬀective bound states) weighted by respective transition rates rather than the
complete level structure[1]. We do not average over several levels, but take all low
lying excited states into account. Further, in the FLYCHK code continuum lowering
is treated within a Stewart-Pyatt like model to implement medium corrections to the
ionization energies. The model interpolates between the two limiting cases: Debye
screening for dilute and hot plasma on the one hand and screening within an ion sphere
model with constant free electron density for dense and cool plasmas an the other
hand[6]. If bound states merge into the continuum, the calculations get discontinuous
since these states suddenly disappear from the implemented rate equations. Using
eﬀective bound states reduces these events. Within our quantum statistical approach,
there is no such discontinuity thanks to the use of the Planck-Larkin renormalization
of bound states [14]. As shown above, we also use an ion sphere model to calculate
the continuum lowering. However, the free electron density within the sphere is not
constant but radially dependent. All in all, we observe several Mott transitions in solid
density argon at temperatures below 50 eV which lead to a higher degree of ionization
than proposed by FLYCHK. Looking at ﬁgure (3) magnesium and neon like states
seem to be more stable, which is due to their closed shell structure. Hence, the slope
of the charge state in ﬁgure (4) ﬂattens for rising plasma temperatures. As the ion
charge rises pressure ionization becomes less important and our results converge to the
FLYCHK values. The oscillation around the values is in accordance with the variing
shell structure of the ions. In agreement with the expectations, less than half ﬁlled
shells seem to be the least stable states and closed shells show a high stability against
temperature increase. In contrast to our detailed slope, the FLYCHK code creates a
rather generic output.

5. Synthetic spectra and temperature distribution

To construct synthetic spectra from the shifted emission energies every line as well as
its ﬁne structure components are assigned a Lorentz proﬁle with natural line width γ
and maximum intensity Imax,

I(E) =

Imax (γ/2)2
(E − E0)2 + (γ/2)2 .

(16)

The central line position E0 is given by the plasma shifted line positions. The
maximum intensity is mainly given by the emitter abundance in the plasma. We
determine all intensities relative to a reference state,

since the one particle wave functions ϕin (initial state, 2p) and ϕﬁn (ﬁnal state, 1s)
change only very slightly [9]. Hence, the Einstein coeﬃcients for spontanious emisssion
are simply ∝ E3

0 and equation (17) can easily be derived.

The Lorentzians are summed up and convoluted with a Gaussian proﬁle of width
Γ to take into account instrumental broadening of the measurements. According to
Neumayer et al.
[1] we varied the broadening parameters within the range of some
eV and found the most suitable combination in a universal natural linewidth of γ = 1
eV and a Gaussian width of Γ = 2.5 eV. A selection of spectra obtained at diﬀerent
plasma temperatures is shown in ﬁgure (5). Keeping the total density and plasma
temperature ﬁxed, the free electron density follows from the composition. Shown are
some typical spectra: At low temperatures, up to some 10 eV, we are in the regime of
M-shell ionization. Since the diﬀerences of the various emission energies are small, the
lines of Ar+ to Ar9+ group indistinguishably within one large main peak which shifts to
higher energies with rising temperatures. With further increase of the temperature,
we enter the regime of L-shell ionization. The main peak becomes less prominent

and several distinguishable peaks appear, which correspond to the emission energies
of the respective ions. We calculated spectra up 250 eV where the Li-like satellites
are dominant. Experimentally observed higher emission energies mainly arise from
argon ions with only one or two electrons (Ly-α, He-α, intercombination line). These
emissions stem from the blow-oﬀ plasma created by the laser impact.

We apply a superposition of our calculated spectra for diﬀerent temperatures to
model the experimental results obtained by Neumayer et al. [1]. To obtain the best ﬁt
the weight of the diﬀerent spectra is determined within a variational approach using
the method of least squares. Results for the best ﬁt and the corresponding temperature
distribution are shown in ﬁgure (6) and ﬁgure (7), respectively. The superimposed
spectrum shows a good agreement especially for the M-shell satellites. The position
and width of the main peak is rather sensitive to the plasma bulk temperature. At a
ﬁrst glimpse, the agreement with the L-shell satellites is less satisfying. The peaks are
at correct positions but the widths seem to small. We attribute this to our choice of
the natural line widths. We use a universal value of γ which implies the same lifetime
for all considered states. But especially highly ionized and excited states experience

lines would blur and give a better ﬁt to the energy spectrum above 2980 eV.

6. Discussion and conclusion

The temperature distribution, which best ﬁts to the experimentally obtained argon
Kα spectra, is a two-peaked curve with local maxima at our lowest temperature value
of 10 eV and at our highest temperature value of 250 eV and a steady decrease of
relative weights for intermediate temperatures. We chose temperature steps of 10 eV
to keep the variation manageable. Smaller steps are possible, however the two peaked
slope of the temperature distribution would not change signiﬁcantly. The two peaks
can be interpreted as a result of the two diﬀerently heated parts of the argon droplet,
namely the cold bulk and hot blow oﬀ plasma. The blow oﬀ plasma is directly created
by the laser-plasma interaction. It is rather hot and dilute and is indicated by the
H- and Ne-like emission lines above 3100 eV. However, as the experimental data is
spatially and temporally integrated, the measurements contain also emissions of not
fully heated or already cooled down particles. Due to such emitters we obtain the
high temperature tail above 200 eV. In fact, this work is more related to the bulk
temperature distribution due to electronic heating. The electrons are accelerated in

to the laser focus and the volume behind. As the electrons scatter and the ions tend

to equilibrate, the heat is transferred radially to cooler regions of the droplet. The
maximum of the temperature distribution at lowest temperatures originates on the one
hand from emitters of the outer spacial regions and on the other hand from particles
that already cooled down before emission.

There are signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the temperature distribution proposed
by Neumayer et al. [1] and the results shown here: according to their FLYCHK results,
they also obtained a two peaked distribution, only our ﬁrst maximum lies at much
lower plasma temperature and our temperature range is about 100 eV broader. These
diﬀerences are due to the diﬀerent results of the composition calculations as show in
the previous chapter and ﬁgure (4). As we obtain higher degrees of ionization at lower
temperatures, we see the general shift of emission lines to higher energies (blue shift)
already at lower temperatures and hence we obtain a temperature of about 10 to 20
eV instead of 50 eV to ﬁt the main peak of the measured spectrum. Neumayer et
al. discussed several mechanisms like resistive heating or radiative heating that might
help to explain the absence of temperatures below 50 eV. However, our results suggest,
that these inﬂuences might not be as substantial as the authors assumed. In order to
gain more insight into the heating and cooling processes within the plasma, kinetic
codes and hydrodynamic simulations are favourable.

The details of the synthetic spectra need further discussion. It turns out, that
using the same broadening for all lines slightly overestimates the width for the main
peak (Ar+ to Ar9+) and underrates the width for the higher lying peaks as pointed
out above. A more detailed discrimination of the widths would improve the agreement
between theory and experimental data. In particular, the theoretically obtained low
minima between the peaks will possibly be smeared out, if the applied broadening
is dependent on the emitter conﬁguration as well as on the plasma parameters. A
quantum statistical approach to the line width would be desirable, which is well
elaborated for H-like systems [16] but needs further development for mid-Z materials.
The inclusion of plasma eﬀects, especially shifts and the merging of bound
states with the continuum, is important to discuss the composition of the plasma
and the density of free electrons. We have shown that such eﬀects have signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the inferred temperature distribution. In general we have shown that Kα
spectroscopy is an interesting means for plasma diagnostics and allows an estimate of
the temperature proﬁle in warm dense matter.
