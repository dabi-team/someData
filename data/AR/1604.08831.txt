ABSTRACT
Molecular oxygen has been detected in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with abun-
dances in the 1–10% range by the ROSINA-DFMS instrument on board the Rosetta spacecraft. Here
we ﬁnd that the radiolysis of icy grains in low-density environments such as the presolar cloud may
induce the production of large amounts of molecular oxygen. We also show that molecular oxygen
can be eﬃciently trapped in clathrates formed in the protosolar nebula, and that its incorporation as
crystalline ice is highly implausible because this would imply much larger abundances of Ar and N2
than those observed in the coma. Assuming that radiolysis has been the only O2 production mecha-
nism at work, we conclude that the formation of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is possible in a
dense and early protosolar nebula in the framework of two extreme scenarios: (1) agglomeration from
pristine amorphous icy grains/particles formed in ISM and (2) agglomeration from clathrates that
formed during the disk’s cooling. The former scenario is found consistent with the strong correlation
between O2 and H2O observed in 67P/C-G’s coma while the latter scenario requires that clathrates
formed from ISM icy grains that crystallized when entering the protosolar nebula.

INTRODUCTION
The Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral
Analysis (ROSINA) Double Focusing Mass Spectrome-
ter (DFMS) on board the Rosetta spacecraft (Balsiger
et al. 2007) enabled the detection of O2 in the coma
of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G) with
local abundances in the 1–10% range and a mean value
of 3.80 ±0.85% (Bieler et al. 2015). A subsequent rein-
vestigation of the 1P/Halley data from the Giotto Neu-
tral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) also indicates that the
coma of comet 1P/Halley should contain O2 with an
abundance of 3.7 ± 1.7% with respect to water, suggest-
ing that this molecule may be a rather common parent
species in comets (Rubin et al. 2015a).

To investigate the origin of O2 in 67P/C-G, Bieler et
(2015) considered the possibility of O2 production
al.
via the radiolysis of water ice incorporated within the
nucleus. Based on 67P/C-G’s known orbital history, they
estimated that any O2 produced during the residence
time of 67P/C-G in the Kuiper Belt was quickly lost
during the ﬁrst pass or two around the Sun. The authors
further found that radiolysis on closer orbit to the Sun
would most likely only aﬀect the top few micrometres

of the nucleus’ active surface. In this case the O2/H2O
ratio produced in these conditions would decrease with
depth. Because they did not observe any variation of
the O2/H2O ratio during the sampling period, Bieler et
al. (2015) ruled out the hypothesis of O2 production via
the radiolysis and determined that O2 must have been
incorporated into 67P/C-G at the time of its formation
in the protosolar nebula (PSN).

In order to explain how O2 could have been incorpo-
rated into the ices of 67P/C-G, we investigate here the
radiolysis hypothesis at epochs prior to the formation of
comets, when icy grains were the dominant solid phase
of the outer PSN. Furthermore, we examine the diﬀerent
trapping scenarios of O2 that could explain its presence.
Because some recent works suggest that this comet may
have been accreted from a mixture of clathrates and pure
crystalline ices formed in the PSN (Mousis et al. 2016;
Luspay-Kuti et al. 2016), we study the propensity for
O2 trapping in clathrates, and also evaluate if its con-
densation as pure crystalline ice is consistent with the
comet’s inferred composition. Among all these investi-
gated mechanisms, we ﬁnd that clathration of O2 is ef-
ﬁcient in the PSN and that radiolysis can explain the
formation of O2 and its stabilization in icy grains. How-
ever, to produce enough O2 molecules, the radiolysis of
icy grains must have happened in a low density environ-
ment such as the presolar cloud.

2. O2 FORMATION VIA RADIOLYSIS
We ﬁrst investigate the possibility of radiolytic produc-
tion of O2 in icy grains present in the outer PSN prior
to their agglomeration by 67P/C-G. The energy avail-
able for radiolysis is provided by the galactic Cosmic Ray
Flux (CRF) impacting icy grains. In the following, since
galactic CR can penetrate into water ice down to depths
of a few tens of meters (Cooper et al. 1998), we only

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Mousis et al.

consider icy grains with sizes below this limit, imply-
ing that no H2O ice can be out of reach of radiolysis.
In our calculations, we use the energy range and CRF
distribution from Yeghikyan (2011) and Cooper et al.
(2003), respectively. The CRF energy dose absorbed by
icy grains located at 30 AU from the sun is within the
∼(5–60)×1016 eV kg−1 yr−1 range, depending on the
disk’s surface density (between 10 and 103 g cm−2; see
Hersant et al. 2001).

O2 is produced by radiolysis of water ice through the
chemical reaction 2 H2O −→ 2 H2 + O2, with an amount
of energy needed to alter one H2O molecule Wr = 235 eV
(Johnson 1991). H2 is then rapidly lost from the water
ice due to its fast diﬀusion. Further reactions with O2
are precluded because the diﬀusion of these molecules
is slowed down by the disk’s low temperatures (John-
son 1990). We have thus assumed that all the en-
ergy absorbed by water ice is used to form O2. To
reach the molecular ratio O2/H2O (1–10%) measured by
Bieler et al. (2015) in 67P/C-G, cosmic rays must alter
twice as many H2O molecules in icy grains. The time τ
needed to reach this ratio is then given by:

τ =

Wr · NA
ECR · MH2O

× fH2O

(1)

where NA (mol−1) is the Avogadro constant, MH2O (kg
mol−1) is the molar mass of water, ECR (eV kg−1 yr−1)
is the CRF energy dose received by water ice and fH2O is
the fraction of altered H2O molecules, which corresponds
to two times the fraction of O2 produced.

Fig. 1.— Time evolution of the fraction of O2 molecules produced
by cosmic rays in an icy grain. Case 1 (green curves) considers the
irradiation of an icy grain placed at 30 AU in the PSN. Case 2
(red curves) considers the irradiation of an icy grain located in a
low density environment (∼10−3 g cm−2). Two CRF values are
explored in each case, namely 1 and 100 times the nominal CRF
value (see text).

Figure 1 shows the results of our calculations. An O2
fraction in the 1–10% range is reached in ∼0.25–2.5 Gyr
at the aforementioned nominal CRF value (Case 1).
These extremely long time periods are incompatible with

the lifetime of icy grains in the PSN (a few 104 yr; Wei-
denschilling and Cuzzi 1993). If icy grains have grown to
sizes larger than tens of meters in the PSN, then the
deepest layers should remain unaltered.
In this case,
even longer timescales would be needed for O2 forma-
tion. However, the CRF may have undergone signiﬁ-
cant enhancements throughout the history of the solar
system, by a factor ∼3 during its passages through the
Milky Way’s spiral arms (a few tens of Myr every 400–
500 Myr; Eﬀenberger et al. 2012; Werner et al. 2015;
Alexeev 2016), or even by a factor of ∼100 during a
few kyr because of a close supernova explosion (<30 pc;
Fields & Ellis 1999). Such enhancements can decrease
the time needed to form O2 by up to a factor 100, which
is still too long for our consideration.

We also consider the possibility of an icy grain re-
ceiving the maximum CRF energy dose estimated by
Yeghikyan (2011), namely ∼1.20×1020 eV kg−1 yr−1.
This value leads to a time τ in the ∼1–10 Myr range
(see case 2 of Fig. 1), or ∼10–100 kyr with a CRF en-
hanced by a factor 100. However, such a high value of
ECR corresponds to a surface density of 10−3 g cm−2,
which can only be reached in molecular clouds. In such
environments, the column densities would be low enough
to form 1–10% of O2 in the icy grains even on very short
timescales. Therefore, to incorporate signiﬁcant amounts
of O2 produced via radiolysis of icy grains, cometary
grains must have formed in the presolar cloud prior to
disk formation.

3. O2 STABILITY IN WATER ICE
An important question is whether O2 molecules pro-
duced via radiolysis of ice grains can remain stabilized
within the water icy matrix of 67P/C-G. The stabiliza-
tion energy is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the en-
ergy of the system of O2 interacting with the ice and the
sum of the energies of the pure ice and O2 at inﬁnite sep-
aration. To investigate this problem, a sampling of the
representative structures of O2 in solid water ice has been
obtained using a strategy based on ﬁrst principle periodic
density functional theory quantum calculations, that has
been proven to be appropriate for modeling bulk and sur-
face ice structures (Lattelais et al. 2011; 2015; Ellinger
et al. 2015). Among the diﬀerent forms, we consid-
ered the apolar variety of hexagonal ice Ih because these
structures have a balanced distribution of alternating hy-
drogen and oxygen avoiding computational artifacts for
surface optimizations and at the same time reproduce
the bulk properties (Casassa et al. 2005). How O2 be-
haves as a function of the number of H2O molecules re-
moved is illustrative of the storage capability of the ice
as a function of porosity. The results of our calculations,
performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation pack-
age (VASP) (Kresse & Hafner 1993; 1994), are presented
below:

1. Starting with no H2O removed,

i.e., the pure
cristalline ice, we found no stabilisation for the in-
clusion of O2 in the hexagonal lattice. It is in fact
an endothermic process.

2. With one H2O removed, and replaced by one O2,
we have a substitution structure whose stabilisa-
tion, in the order of 10−3 eV, is meaningless.

estimate the composition of these crystalline structures
formed in the PSN. To evaluate the trapping eﬃciency
of O2, we consider a gas constituted of O2 and CO. After
H2O, CO is one of the dominant gases found in 67P/C-G
(Le Roy et al. 2015) and in most of comets (Bockel´ee-
Morvan et al. 2004). The Kihara parameters for the
molecule-water interactions employed in our calculations
are derived from Mohammadi et al. (2003) for O2 and
from Mohammadi et al. (2005) for CO. These represent
the most recent sets of data found in the literature for the
two species. We refer the reader to the model description
provided in Mousis et al. (2010) for further details.

3. With 2, 3, and 4 adjacent H2O molecules removed
from the hexagonal lattice we obtained well deﬁned
cavities that, after reconstruction, show diﬀerent
shapes according to the positions of the entities re-
moved. The stabilization energies were found to
be on the order of 0.2–0.3 eV, going to 0.4–0.5 eV
for an embedded O2 dimer. A typical structure of
embedding is illustrated in Fig. 2 where O2 is sta-
bilized with an energy of ∼0.23 eV. This energy is
of the order of that of a water dimer which means
that the presence of O2 should not perturb the ice
structure until it is ejected into the coma via sub-
limation with the surrounding H2O molecules.

It should be stressed that the formation of one O2 re-
quires at least the destruction of two H2O. The present
simulation is fully consistent with the aforementioned ra-
diolysis hypothesis, where the irradiation process is at
the origin of both the formation of O2 and the develop-
ment of the cavity in which it remains sequestered. Sim-
ilar results are obtained in the case of O2 stabilization in
amorphous ice.

Fig. 3.— O2/CO ratio in clathrates formed at 45 K and the
corresponding O2/H2O ratio in the coma, as a function of the co-
existing O2/CO ratio in the PSN gas phase. The “Min” and “Max”
labels correspond to calculations of the O2/H2O ratio in 67P/C-G’s
coma, assuming that the CO/H2O abundance is between 2.7 and
21% (see text). The vertical red dashed lines represent the O2/CO
ratio in the PSN gas phase needed to form clathrates giving 1%
O2 relative to H2O in the coma.

When clathrates destabilize in the nucleus, the trapped
volatiles are released prior to water sublimation, imply-
ing that the water vapor measured at the time of the
O2 sampling by ROSINA should be derived from the va-
porization of crystalline ice layers located closer to the
surface. Hence, the O2 depletion is better quantiﬁed by
comparing the O2/CO ratio in clathrates and the coma
value since these two species are expected to be released
simultaneously from destabilized clathrates. Figure 3
represents the value of the O2/CO ratio in structure I
clathrates7 as a function of the O2/CO ratio in the co-
existing gas phase at a chosen disk’s temperature of ∼45
K. This value is within the temperature range needed for
clathrates to form in the PSN from a gaseous mixture of
protosolar composition that reproduces the Ar/CO and
N2/CO ratios measured in 67P/C-G’s coma (Mousis et
al. 2016). We ﬁnd that, whatever the O2/CO ratio con-
sidered for the initial PSN gas phase, it is enriched by a

(Mohammadi et al. 2003, 2005).

pact amorphous ice. The cavity corresponds to a void of 3 H2O
molecules from an hexagonal apolar lattice.

4. O2 CLATHRATION IN THE PSN
One possible source of O2 in the nucleus of 67P/C-G is
the trapping of O2 in clathrates that formed in the PSN
prior to having been agglomerated by the comet as it
formed. This is supported by recent works showing that
the Ar/CO and N2/CO ratios and the time variation of
other volatile species measured in 67P/C-G’s coma are
found to be consistent with the presence of clathrates in
its nucleus (Mousis et al. 2016; Luspay-Kuti et al. 2016).
To investigate the amount of O2 that could have been
trapped in clathrates and now be present in 67P/C-G, we
use the same statistical thermodynamic model as the one
described in Mousis et al. (2010, 2016), which is used to

Mousis et al.

factor of ∼1.4–1.8 in the formed clathrate. Figure 3 also
shows that the O2/CO ratio must be in the 0.026–0.24
range in the PSN gas phase for the clathrate trapping
mechanism to agree with the measured range of O2/H2O
in the coma (∼1%), assuming that all cavities are ﬁlled
by guest molecules and that the CO/H2O abundance ra-
tio in the coma corresponds to the sampled value (∼2.7–
21%; Le Roy et al. 2015). This range of O2/CO ratios is
consistent with values obtained at distances beyond ∼5
AU in a T Tauri disk (Walsh et al. 2015). Therefore,
our calculations show that the clathration of O2 in the
PSN is a realistic mechanism to account for the O2/H2O
ratio observed by ROSINA in 67P/C-G’s coma.

5. O2 CONDENSATION IN THE PSN
An alternative possibility for the observed presence of
O2 in the coma of 67P/C-G is that the O2 could have
been agglomerated as pure crystalline ice by the nucleus
forming at cooler PSN temperatures than those required
for clathration. To investigate this scenario, we cal-
culated the temperature dependence of the equilibrium
curves of O2, CO, N2 and Ar pure crystalline ices via
the use of the polynomial relations reported by Fray &
Schmidt (2009). To derive the partial pressures for each
gas, we assumed that O, C, N and Ar exist in protosolar
abundances in the PSN (Lodders et al. 2009), with all C
and all N in the forms of CO and N2, respectively. The
partial pressure of O2 is derived from the O2/CO gas
phase ratio (∼33%) predicted beyond the snowline of a
T Tauri disk via an extensive chemical model (Walsh et
al. 2015). The equilibrium curves of O2, CO, N2 and Ar
pure crystalline ices are represented along with the equi-
librium curve of the CO–N2–Ar multiple guest clathrate
proposed by Mousis et al. (2016) to explain 67P/C-G’s
composition, as a function of the total PSN pressure in
Fig. 4. Because the CO–N2–Ar multiple guest clathrate
is by far dominated by CO (see Fig. 1 of Mousis et al.
2016), we assume that its partial pressure is the same
as for CO crystalline ice. The equilibrium curve of the
clathrate is taken from Lectez et al. (2015).

From the examination of the condensation sequence
presented in Fig. 4, we ﬁnd that the hypothesis of O2
agglomeration as pure crystalline ice is inconsistent with
67P/C-G’s current composition. The fact that Ar/CO
and N2/CO ratios are found to be signiﬁcantly depleted
by factors of ∼90 and 10 in 67P/C-G’s coma, respec-
tively, compared to the protosolar values (Rubin et al.
2015b; Balsiger et al. 2015; Mousis et al. 2016), im-
plies that Ar and N2 cannot form substantial amounts
of pure crystalline ices at the formation location of the
comet in the PSN (Mousis et al. 2016). Instead, it has
been proposed that these volatiles were mostly trapped
in CO-dominated clathrates (Mousis et al. 2016). Under
these circumstances, because the equilibrium curve of O2
ice is in the vicinity of those of Ar and N2 ices, the incor-
poration of O2 in this form would require the trapping
of larger amounts of Ar and N2, incidentally leading to
quasi protosolar Ar/CO and N2/CO ratios. This does
not agree with the depleted ratios observed in 67P/C-G.

6. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we have investigated several scenarios
that may explain the presence of molecular oxygen in
the nucleus of 67P/C-G. Our results are the following:

Fig. 4.— Solid lines: equilibrium curves of O2, CO, N2 and Ar
pure crystalline ices as a function of total disk pressure. Dashed
line: equilibrium curve of the CO-dominated clathrate as a function
of total disk pressure (see text).

• Even with a strong CRF enhancement due to the
presence of a nearby supernova, we ﬁnd that the ra-
diolysis of icy grains is not fast enough in the PSN
to create amounts of O2 comparable with those
observed in 67P/C-G. Instead, icy grains must be
placed in low-density environments such as molec-
ular clouds to allow radiolysis to work eﬃciently.
The irradiation process also favors the stabiliza-
tion of O2 molecules in the icy matrix via the de-
velopment of cavities and is compatible with both
amorphous and crystalline ice structures.

• O2 can be eﬃciently trapped in clathrates formed
in the PSN. The O2/CO ratio in the clathrate
phase is up to ∼2 times the O2/CO ratio in the
coexisting PSN gas phase.

• The incorporation of O2 as pure crystalline ice is
unlikely in 67P/C-G because the condensation of
this species in the PSN would imply much larger
abundances of Ar and N2 than those observed in
the coma.

Based on these results, and assuming that radiolysis
has been the only mechanism for producing O2, we ﬁnd
that the formation of 67P/C-G is possible in a dense
and early PSN in the framework of two extreme sce-
narios: (1) agglomeration from pristine amorphous icy
grains/particles formed in the ISM and (2) agglomeration
from multiple guest clathrates including O2 that formed
during the cooling of the disk subsequent to the vaporiza-
tion of the amorphous icy grains entering the PSN. How-
ever, scenario 1 was found inconsistent with ROSINA
pre-perihelion observations of volatile abundances in the
coma. In contrast, Mousis et al. (2016) and Luspay-Kuti
et al. (2016) have shown that scenario 2 could match
these data if 67P/C-G agglomerated from a mixture of
clathrates and crystalline ices that condensed in the PSN.
Also, scenario 2 is compatible with a possible chemical
production of O2 in the PSN gas phase (Walsh et al.

2015). In this picture, whatever the considered source,
i.e. radiolysis of ISM grains or/and PSN gas phase chem-
istry, O2 is eﬃciently entrapped in clathrates prior to
their agglomeration by 67P/C-G.

On the other hand, with the incorporation of O2 in
the cavities created by CRF in the icy matrix, scenario
1 naturally provides an explanation for the strong corre-
lation found between the O2 and H2O production rates
observed in 67P/C-G’s coma (Bieler et al. 2015). If this
scenario is correct, this would make implausible the ac-
cretion of 67P/C-G from clathrates and crystalline ices
originating from the PSN. Meanwhile, a way to reconcile
scenario 2 with the strong O2-H2O correlation would be
to assume that the icy grains initially formed as in sce-
nario 1. These icy grains/particles would have then sub-
sequently experienced an amorphous-to-crystalline phase
transition in the 130–150 K temperature range when en-
tering the disk (Kouchi et al. 1994; Maldoni et al. 2003;
Ciesla 2014). In this alternative scenario, all volatiles ini-
tially adsorbed by ISM amorphous ice would be released
in the PSN gas phase during phase transition. With
the cooling of the disk, these volatiles would have been
later trapped in the clathrates formed with the crys-
tallized icy grains. The case of O2 is unique because,
due to its formation process, this molecule is inserted
into the icy matrix. In spite of the phase transition, O2
would remain stable within the icy matrix because the
strength of the interaction between O2 and the surround-

ing H2O molecules is expected not to decrease (eventu-
ally increase) upon crystallization. In this scenario, CO,
Ar, N2 would be trapped in clathrates with O2 remaining
embedded in water, in a way consistent with the observed
correlation.

To conclude, further post-perihelion ROSINA data, in
particular the precise measurements of the relative abun-
dances of the diﬀerent volatiles as a function of geography
and time, are needed to disentangle between the existing
formation scenarios. It is also possible that only the in
situ sampling of a nucleus by a future lander will provide
a deﬁnitive answer to the question of the formation con-
ditions of 67P/C-G and other Jupiter Family Comets in
the PSN.
