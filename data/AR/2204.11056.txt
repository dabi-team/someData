ABSTRACT
Changes in the supercycle lengths of some SU UMa-type dwarf novae have been detected
by other studies, and indicate that the mass transfer rates noticeably decrease over time.
We investigated the supercycle lengths of three SU UMa-type dwarf novae: AR Pic, QW
Ser and V521 Peg, to determine if they have detectable changes in their supercycles. We
present the results of optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of these sources. Our
observations were conducted in 2016 and 2017 at the Boyden Observatory and the Sutherland
station of the South African Astronomical Observatory. The quiescent results indicated that all
three sources are typical SU UMa-type dwarf novae. We also present results of AR Pic and QW
Ser in outburst and of V521 Peg during a precursor outburst and superoutburst. Light curves
were supplemented by the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, the ASAS-3 and ASAS-SN
archives, and the AAVSO International database in order to investigate the long-term behavior
of these sources. Our results combined with catalogued properties for all short-period dwarf
novae, shows a possible relationship between the supercycle time in SU UMa systems and
their orbital periods, which is interpreted as the decline in the mass transfer rate as systems
evolve toward and away from the ‘period minimum’. At the shortest orbital periods, SU UMa
systems are almost indistinguishable from WZ Sge systems. However, we propose that the
scaleheight between the secondary’s photosphere and L1 may be a factor that distinguish the
SU UMa subclasses.

INTRODUCTION

Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are close binary systems in which a
Roche-lobe ﬁlling low-mass star transfers matter through the in-
ner Lagrangian point (L1) to a white dwarf (WD). The magnetic
ﬁeld strength of the WD dictates the method by which the trans-
ferred material accretes onto the WD surface, which is either via
an accretion disc (non-magnetic systems) or via the WD’s mag-
netic ﬁeld lines (magnetic systems). The WD primary has a mass
range 0.8 M(cid:12) ≤ 𝑀1 ≤ 1.2 M(cid:12) (e.g. Knigge 2011; Zorotovic et al.
2011) and the secondary is a typical K- or M type star with a mass
𝑀2 ≤ 0.5 M(cid:12) (Giovannelli & Sabau-Graziati 2015; Smak 1984).
They have short orbital periods mostly in the 1–12 hr range, and
hence are compact, with a binary separation ∼ R(cid:12) (see Warner
1995 for an in-depth review).

Dwarf novae (DNe) are a non-magnetic CV sub-class and are
the most common CV type, being characterized by optical outbursts
(∼2–8 mags) that recur on time-scales of days to years. SU UMa-

type DNe are a further subclass that show superoutbursts in addition
to the normal DNe outbursts, and uniquely display superhumps, i.e.
prominent periodic humps in the light curves, during superoutbursts
(e.g Vogt 1974; Warner 1975).

Normal outbursts last for ∼ 2 − 3 days and are caused by a
build-up of material in the accretion disc that triggers a thermal-
viscous instability (e.g Lasota 2001). The disc switches from a
cold, low-viscosity state (quiescence) to a bright, hot, highly vis-
cous state (outburst) (e.g. Smak 1984), in which the accretion rate
onto the WD is greatly enhanced (Osaki 1974). The DN returns
to quiescence when a cooling wave, originating in the outer disc,
propagates inwards and ends the outburst (e.g. Hellier 2001, p. 71,
and references therein).

Superoutbursts are less frequent than normal outbursts but last
much longer (∼ 10 − 14 days). Whitehurst (1988) discovered that
these arise from a tidal instability in the disc of systems with a mass
ratio 𝑞 = 𝑀2/𝑀1 < 0.3, which are almost entirely of short orbital
periods (≤ 2hrs). In the context of the Thermal Tidal Instability
Model (TTIM), the disc becomes tidally unstable when its outer ra-
dius exceeds a critical value of 𝑅cr (cid:39) 0.46𝑎, and when a parametric

resonance of 3:1 between the particle and binary orbit is reached
(Osaki 1989; Hirose & Osaki 1990). It therefore becomes unstable
against non-axisymmetric perturbations and a slowly precessing,
eccentric disc develops.

The low 𝑞 values of SU UMa-systems also makes them of
interest as the WD analogue to the class of low-mass X-ray binary
(LMXB) systems that contain accreting black-holes (BH), as they
too have very low 𝑞 values (∼ 0.1), see e.g. Casares et al. (2017).
The BH LMXBs share other properties with SU UMa-systems, as
they are also transients (mostly with recurrence times of ∼ years)
and have even been seen to display superhumps at times during
outburst (O’Donoghue & Charles 1996).

The exact trigger of SU UMa superoutbursts is still debated,
but proposed models and observations show that normal outbursts
are precursors of superoutbursts (see Schreiber et al. 2004 for an
in-depth review). During a normal outburst the disc expands as
viscosity within the disc results in the outward transfer of angular
momentum. When the disc expands far enough to interact with
the secondary, the secondary’s tidal torque is enhanced as angular
momentum is transferred from the disc’s outer edge to the secondary.
Therefore, during every orbital cycle, the tidal inﬂuence of the
secondary removes angular momentum from the disc’s outer edge,
causing it to contract radially. The surface density at the outer edge
is hence pushed above a threshold, where no low-viscosity cool state
exists, and a superoutburst is triggered as the disc is kept in a hot
state (see Osaki 1989, for a full analytical treatment and summary).
A precursor (normal) outburst is typically seen as a shoulder on the
rise to superoutburst (Cannizzo et al. 2010) with a dip ∼ 0.25 − 3
mag before the onset of superoutburst (Warner 1995, p. 188, and
references therein), and have been seen in many SU UMa DNe, e.g.
VW Hyi (Bateson 1977), T Leo (Howell et al. 1999) and V1504
Cyg (Osaki & Kato 2013).

A superoutburst has a prolonged maximum state that is ob-
servable as a sloping plateau in light curves, and the decline to
quiescence is slower than for normal outbursts. When the non-
axisymmetric nature of the contracting disc decays and the tidal
torque is reduced, the superoutburst ends when a cooling wave
propagates inwards, resulting in the disc transitioning back to a
low-viscosity state.

Superoutbursts are also characterized by superhumps in the
light curves with amplitudes of ∼ 0.1−0.3 mag and periods ∼ 1−5%
longer than 𝑃orb (Patterson et al. 2005). These humps represent the
varying tidal energy released by the deformation of the disc through
an orbital cycle, but are typically delayed for ∼ 2 days from the
onset of the superoutburst (e.g. Nogami et al. 2004, and references
therein). The superhumps reach a maximum amplitude at outburst
maximum and decay during the plateau phase.

There are three distinct types of SU UMa DNe based on their
supercycle lengths (𝑃sc), i.e. the interval between two successive
superoutbursts. Apart from the ‘standard’ SU UMa systems (with
𝑃sc ∼ 100 − 1000 days), the two other types are at the extremes:
ER UMa systems, which erupt frequently (𝑃sc ∼ 20 − 50 days),
in contrast to WZ Sge systems, which have very rare superout-
bursts (𝑃sc > 1000 days), and also undergo few or no normal
outbursts (e.g. Hellier 2001, p. 87, and references therein). The
mass transfer rate is the key factor that determines 𝑃sc, with typ-
ical values for SU UMa systems ∼ (cid:164)𝑀2 ∼ 10−10 M(cid:12) yr−1. This
increases to ∼ (cid:164)𝑀2 ∼ 6 × 10−10 M(cid:12) yr−1 in ER UMa systems, re-
sulting in more frequent superoutbursts, whereas it is much lower
( (cid:164)𝑀2 < 10−10 M(cid:12) yr−1) in WZ Sge types, hence producing much
rarer superoutbursts.
These diﬀerent

(cid:164)𝑀2 values are very likely a function of these

systems’ binary evolution, and Otulakowska-Hypka & Olech (2013)
have shown that individual objects display increases in their 𝑃sc
values when observed over ∼ 20 years. In an eﬀort to expand on the
list of SU UMa DNe showing such changes in 𝑃sc, we selected three
systems for further study: AR Pic, QW Ser and V521 Peg. These
have known 𝑃sc values, are observable from our South African
facilities, and indicate outburst activity in long-term light curves (as
shown in Fig. 1’s ∼ 17 year monitoring based on the CRTS (Catalina
Real-Time Transient Survey; Drake et al. 2009, 2013, 2014), ASAS-
3 (All Sky Automated Survey; Pojmanski 2002), ASAS-SN (All Sky
Automated Survey for SuperNovae; Shappee et al. 2014; Jayasinghe
et al. 2019) and AAVSO (American Association of Variable Star
Observers; Kafka 2019) archives.

We studied their normal and superoutburst

recurrence
timescales, and discuss these within the framework of current evo-
lutionary models. The observational cadence of these surveys was
low, and so we also performed our own observations (both pho-
tometry and spectroscopy), investigating our targets during normal
outbursts (AR Pic and QW Ser) and a superoutburst (V521 Peg)
to determine if their outburst properties deviated from previously
published outbursts, and to search for changes in 𝑃sc. V521 Peg is
of particular interest since to date no normal outbursts have been
recorded (Rodríguez-Gil et al. 2005) and it undergoes infrequent
superoutbursts (Aungwerojwit et al. 2006). This behaviour resem-
bles that of WZ Sge systems which prompted us to investigate V521
Peg’s classiﬁcation.

The known properties of AR Pic, QW Ser and V521 Peg are
summarised in Section 2 and the observations, data reductions and
supplementary data used are in Section 3. The results of the obser-
vations are presented in Section 4.

2 KNOWN PROPERTIES

The key properties of these three SU UMa-type DNe are sum-
marised in Table 1, including, in particular, the latest Gaia DR2
distances. Given their relative proximity (a few hundred pc), we
used the simple parallax equation (𝑑 = 1
𝑝 ) and associated errors
(𝜎(𝑑) =
) in computing the distances, rather than the more
detailed analysis of Luri et al. (2018).

2.1 AR Pic

AR Pic (CTCV J0549-4921) is a known SU UMa-system (e.g.
Maza et al. 1989; Tappert et al. 2004; Imada et al. 2008) with an
average 𝑉 ∼ 16.9 in quiescence, during which it displays typical
DN features, e.g. moderately strong H and He i, and fainter He ii
and Fe ii emission lines (Tappert et al. 2004). Quiescent light curves
exhibit two unequal humps which are attributed to an observable
hot spot typically seen in low mass transfer rate DNe (see Tappert
et al. 2004, and references therein). They also show no eclipses,
indicating that AR Pic has a low to intermediate inclination (Imada
et al. 2008). Tappert et al. (2004) determined an orbital ephemeris,
but its phasing is now indeterminate.

Kato et al. (2009) determined that AR Pic generally has short
outbursts that only last a day, with an average outburst amplitude of
∼ 4 mag (Drake et al. 2009). It showed no periodic features during
outburst, but moderate ﬂickering (Tappert et al. 2004).

Imada et al. (2008) were the ﬁrst to classify AR Pic as an
SU UMa-system, after observing a superoutburst in 2006 that was
detected during the rising phase, reaching a maximum of 𝑉 ∼ 13. It

during a superoutburst in 2011, i.e. a period excess of 𝜀 (cid:39) 0.037

2.2 QW Ser

QW Ser (TmzV46) was a known DN (e.g. Takamizawa 1998;
Schmeer 1999; Kato & Uemura 1999) and later conﬁrmed as SU
UMa-type (e.g. Patterson et al. 2003; Olech et al. 2003; Nogami
et al. 2004). It is quite faint during quiescence (𝑉 ∼ 18) and exhibits
a double hump structure in the light curves, attributed to orbital
modulation (Olech et al. 2003). Its quiescent spectrum exhibits
double-peaked emission lines from the accretion disc (Patterson
et al. 2003). The H𝛼 line, with a peak separation of ∼ 1100 km s−1,
was used to determine a systemic velocity of 𝛾 = 10 ± 6 km s−1,

and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of 𝐾1 = 85 ± 8 km s−1 for the
WD. Patterson (2011) determined an inclination angle of 𝑖 (cid:39) 60◦.
Previous outbursts in ASAS-3 (Takamizawa 1998) show out-
burst durations ∼ 2 − 3 days (see e.g. Nogami et al. 2004), how-
ever, Kato & Uemura (1999) reported one lasting ∼ 11 − 16 days.
Nogami et al. (2004) determined a maximum 𝑀V of 5.2 ± 0.2 and
normal outburst duty cycle of ∼ 50 days. During superoutbursts,
QW Ser typically had an outburst amplitude of ∼ 5 mag and lasted
∼ 15 days (e.g Patterson et al. 2003; Olech et al. 2003; Nogami
et al. 2004). It slowly declined during the plateau phase at a rate of
0.086 − 0.11 mag day−1 and rapidly thereafter at 1.2 mag day−1.
Superhumps developed within 2 days of the superoutburst onset and
reached a maximum amplitude of 0.35 mag within 4 days of onset
(Nogami et al. 2004). Since 1999, the supercycle length has been
∼ 220 − 270 days.

2.3 V521 Peg

V521 Peg (HS 2219+1824) was ﬁrst classiﬁed as a CV candidate
in the Hamburg Quasar Survey (Gänsicke et al. 2002), and later
identiﬁed as a SU UMa-system (Rodríguez-Gil et al. 2005, here-
after RG05). It has a quiescent 𝑉 ∼ 17.3 and displays a double
hump structure of uneven amplitude that was associated with an
observable hot spot (RG05, Aungwerojwit et al. 2006).

In quiescence, it displayed double-peaked H and He i emission
lines from a disc, indicating an average velocity of ∼ 660 km s−1
for the outer disc edge, but no absorption features of the donor star
were detected (RG05). Broad Balmer absorption troughs, in which
the H𝛽 to H𝛾 emission lines were embedded, were attributed to the
WD photospheric spectrum. RG05 also detected a peculiar, very
narrow emission feature within the double-peaked proﬁle which
they attributed to chromospheric emission from the inner face of
the secondary, possibly due to UV-irradiation from the hot WD.
Velocities of 𝐾1 = 50 ± 2 km s−1 for the WD and 𝐾2 = 257 ±
10 km s−1 for the secondary star were determined from H𝛼 emission
radial velocity curves and Patterson (2011) estimated 𝑖 (cid:39) 55◦.

To date, no normal outbursts had been recorded for this source.
V521 Peg is regarded as a “low-activity” system that undergoes in-
frequent superoutbursts (Aungwerojwit et al. 2006), with supercycle
estimates of 300 days (Patterson 2011) and 170 days (Otulakowska-
Hypka et al. 2016). Superoutbursts had amplitudes of ∼ 5 mag and
lasted longer than ∼ 10 days (RG05). Superhumps, with 𝑃sh (cid:39) 1.484
hr, were observed approximately 1 day after superoutburst maxi-
mum, and Kato et al. (2014𝑏) noted that the superhump proﬁle in
the light curves of a 2013 superoutburst became double-humped
during the rapid fading phase.

3 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTIONS

Optical spectroscopy and photometry of our three targets was con-
ducted between June 2016 and September 2017, of which 40% were
performed simultaneously. Supplementary data was obtained from
the CRTS, ASAS-3, ASAS-SN and AAVSO archives.

3.1 Spectroscopy

the
Optical spectroscopy of these sources was conducted at
Sutherland station of the South African Astronomical Observa-
tory (SAAO), using the 1.9-m telescope equipped with SpUpNIC
(Spectrograph Upgrade - Newly Improved Cassegrain). For details
of these observations and the source states, see Table 2. Gratings G4

and G7, with resolutions of 1.8 Å and 6.6 Å, respectively (Crause
et al. 2016), were utilized, together with a CuAr lamp for wavelength
calibration with both gratings. The slit width was set to 1.5(cid:48)(cid:48) for all
observations and no star ﬁlters were used.

Standard routines of IRAF were used to perform bias and ﬂat
ﬁeld correction, and the spectra were calibrated in wavelength using
the CuAr arc frames. Flux calibration was performed with respect
to the spectrophotometric standard stars observed in the same night.
The cosmic ray removal performed by the apall task in IRAF was
suﬃcient and the spectra of each night were stacked to obtain one
average spectrum per date. Note that emission lines marked as H𝜖 ∗
in the given spectra, are H𝜖 lines blended with Ca ii lines, and the
⊕ symbol marks the atmospheric A- and B-bands.

3.2 Photometry

Photometric observations were conducted at the Boyden Obser-
vatory, Bloemfontein, with the UFS-Boyden 1.52-m and 0.4-m
Watcher robotic telescope1, and at the SAAO, Sutherland, with the
1.0-m plus SHOC (Sutherland High-speed Optical Camera). The
details of these observations are summarized in Table 3.

The UFS-Boyden 1.52-m telescope was equipped with a
770 × 1152 pixel Apogee U55 Back-illuminated CCD camera that
provided a ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of 2.5(cid:48) × 3.7(cid:48), and we used a C-ﬁlter
(Clear, white light). After an outburst of QW Ser (August 2016) and
a superoutburst of V521 Peg (September 2017) were detected, the
Watcher robotic telescope was utilized to continue monitoring them
until they returned to quiescence. Watcher was equipped with a
1024 × 1024 pixel Andor iXon+ 888 CCD camera and a Meade
𝑓 /6.3 Series 4000 focal reducer, providing a FOV of 10(cid:48) × 10(cid:48)
(Murphy 2014). The QW Ser outburst was followed with g(cid:48), i(cid:48), r(cid:48)
ﬁlters and the V521 Peg superoutburst with Bessel BVRI and C
ﬁlters. Only the C-ﬁlter and r(cid:48)-ﬁlter data were used for this study.

The SAAO 1.0-m telescope was equipped with SHOC, a high-
speed instrument that can achieve frame rates of up to 20 frames
per second during normal operations. SHOC2 consists of an Andor
iXon X3 888 Electron Multiplying (EM) 1024 × 1024 pixel back-
illuminated CCD camera, providing a FOV of 2.85(cid:48)×2.85(cid:48), together
with a global positioning system (GPS), and two ﬁlter wheels that
include Bessel UBVRI, Sloan u(cid:48)g(cid:48)r(cid:48)i(cid:48)z(cid:48) and Stromgren uvby ﬁlters.
Our observations were performed in conventional mode i.e. utilizing
a 1 MHz 16 bit conventional ampliﬁer, and the internal computer
clock was used to trigger the camera and provide time stamps. No
ﬁlters were used and we only observed the sources in “white light”.
Data reductions, namely bias, dark current and ﬂat-ﬁeld correc-
tions, were performed by using standard routines within the IRAF
package (Massey 1997). A Python-based pipeline3 developed by
Kotze (2013) was partially used to perform reductions on SHOC
data. The DAOPHOT package in IRAF was used to apply aperture
photometry. A weighted diﬀerential photometry procedure was ap-
plied, following the same method as discussed by Everett & Howell
(2001) and Burdanov et al. (2014). Two comparison stars with the
lowest mean variance in magnitude were utilized. Diﬀerential mag-
nitudes were not transformed to a standard system for absolute pho-
tometry. For diﬀerent observations to be comparable, a magnitude

oﬀset was determined for each dataset and added to the diﬀerential
magnitudes. These oﬀset values were calculated by using the av-
erage oﬀset of the comparison stars’ magnitudes from those in the
NOMAD Catalog (Zacharias et al. 2005). The 𝑉-magnitude oﬀset
values were then applied to the diﬀerential magnitudes. For each
exposure the mid-exposure time was converted to Barycentric Ju-
lian Date (BJD) in the Dynamical Time standard (TDB), using the
‘UTC2BJD’ Time Utility of the Ohio State University4 (Eastman
et al. 2010).

3.3 CRTS, ASAS-3, ASAS-SN and AAVSO data

Light curves from the CRTS, ASAS-3, ASAS-SN and AAVSO
archives were used to increase the photometric baseline for our
targets. The beneﬁt of utilizing long-term light curves from various
surveys is that outbursts possibly missed by one survey could have
been detected by another.

The CRTS Data Release 25, and 36, and the ASAS-37 websites
provide magnitudes already transformed to Landolt 𝑉. The JDs of
the downloaded CRTS data were converted to BJDTDB using the
same method described in Section 3.2. We used the ASAS-3 data
extracted with aperture 3 (‘MAG_2’) as it had the lowest errors,
whereas data with ‘C’ (=‘29.99, not measured’) and ‘D’ (=‘worst
data, probably useless’) quality ﬂags were removed. For each ASAS-
3 data point the Heliocentric Julian Date (HJD) was converted to
BJDTDB by using the ‘HJD2BJD’ Time Utility8 (Eastman et al.
2010).

The ASAS-SN 𝑉-band data9 were downloaded and the times
converted to BJDTDB in the same way. The AAVSO International
Database is a collection of variable star observations made primarily
by the amateur astronomical community, but also includes data from
professional researchers and published literature. AAVSO techni-

control analysis, and perform data error checks at every stage. We
downloaded our V-band (or ‘CV’, meaning ‘Clear reduced to V
sequence’) data10, removing any that did not have a ‘V’ (=‘observa-
tion passed validation tests’) or ‘Z’ (=‘pre-validation, data checked
for typos and input errors’) ﬂag, and times were again converted to
BJDTDB as described above.

All the above data were used to plot a composite light curve
for each source from which the duty cycles and supercycles could
be determined (Fig. 1).

4 RESULTS

4.1 AR Pic

Figure 2. Overall light curve of AR Pic’s Feb 2017 outburst, supplemented
by ASAS-SN. Error bars are smaller than the symbols. Arrows indicate dates
when spectra were obtained.

AR Pic was observed by CRTS, ASAS-3, ASAS-SN and AAVSO
in quiescence and during approximately 24 outbursts. The 2001–
18 light curve (Fig. 1, top panel), indicates an average 𝑉q ∼ 17
and outburst amplitude of ∼ 4 mag, as seen earlier (Drake et al.
2009). By examining each outburst individually for duration, mean
decline rate (outburst ∼ 0.6 − 0.8 mag day−1; superoutburst < 0.5
mag day−1) and detectable plateau phase (decline rate ∼ 0.1 mag
day−1), we identiﬁed 8 normal and 7 superoutbursts. Due to the low
cadence it was not possible to detect superhumps or the nature of
all outbursts. From this we estimate a duty cycle of ∼ 60 days and
𝑃sc ∼ 510 days. Our 𝑃sc is shorter than the 𝑃sc ∼ 750 − 800 days
determined by Kato et al. (2009). However, we do not ascribe this
to a change in the system’s mass transfer rate, but rather a better
constraint of 𝑃sc, since our light curve spans a longer interval than
the ASAS-3 light curve used by Kato et al.

During spectroscopic observations on 18 February 2017
(Fig. 5, top panel), the source was found to be ∼ 2 mags brighter
than 3 days earlier, and was in outburst. Fig. 2 shows the composite
outburst light curve compiled from the UFS-Boyden 1.52-m tele-
scope data and supplemented with ASAS-SN data. The black arrows
indicate where spectra were obtained and show that the quiescent
spectrum on 15 February (dashed line) was taken just before the rise
to outburst. The spectrum from 18 February was obtained ∼ 3 days
into outburst (dot-dash line). AR Pic reached quiescence within 5
days, fading at a mean rate of 0.74 mag day−1. These observations
conﬁrm that AR Pic has normal outbursts that last longer than ∼ 1
day, contrary to previous reports (Kato et al. 2009).

To establish the nature of the outburst, simultaneous spectro-
scopic and photometric observations were conducted on 19 Febru-
ary 2017 (gray line in Fig. 2). No superhumps were detected in the
light curve (Fig. 3, top panel), but this is clariﬁed by Fig. 2 which
shows that the photometric data were obtained far past the peak
of the outburst. There is also no plateau phase in Fig. 2, therefore,
the outburst was classiﬁed as a normal one. The emission lines
were notably single-peaked during the outburst (Fig. 5, top panel),
indicating that the outburst region dominated the emission.

The known ephemeris of AR Pic (see §2.1; converted to
BJDTDB) was used to calculate the orbital phases in Fig. 3. No
eclipses were detected in these light curves, indicating an inclina-
tion of 𝑖 < 75◦ (e.g. Hellier 2001, p. 190, and references therein).
The strong ﬂickering in the light curves, also observed by Tappert
et al. (2004), is further evidence of a very active hot spot and possi-
ble magnetic eddies that formed in the disc. The light curves do not
appear to show an obvious correlation between ﬂickering and orbital
phase. This was investigated by binning the photometric data of 26

ﬂickering, but no orbital modulation is visible. Error bars are included but
small relative to the data points.

February into 0.05 phase bins and folding on the ephemeris given
by Tappert et al. (2004). Two humps are visible in the folded light
curve shown in Fig. 4 and suggests that ﬂickering is superimposed
on the orbital modulation. However, the minimum in the light curve
has shifted, as expected given the original ephemeris accuracy. The
two humps were also detected by Tappert et al. (2004) and correlates
with the result of Dai et al. (2018), who modelled the contribution
of hotpots to the optical emission of accretion-powered systems.

In quiescence, AR Pic displayed a typical DN spectrum with
H, He i and Fe ii emission (Fig. 5, 15, 23 and 26 Feb 2017), along

disc. No WD or donor features were visible.

Fig. 6 illustrates the changing asymmetry of the double-peaked
H𝛽 proﬁle in phase-combined spectra from 26 February 2017. The
asymmetrical change is attributed to the hot spot rotating with the
orbital period. The hot spot is clearly visible at phase 0.3 (blue peak
higher) and at phase 0.8 (red peak higher). The peak separation
is ∼ 1200 km s−1, implying that the disc’s outer edge velocity
is ∼ 600 km s−1, and the emission-line wings indicate inner disc
velocities of ∼ 2200 km s−1. By comparing the double-peaked
proﬁle with the model of Horne & Marsh (1986), the sharp peaks
are characteristic of an optically thick disc and the deep central
reversal suggests an intermediate to high inclination.

The H𝛽 lines in the 26 February spectra are also plotted as
a grey-scale in Fig. 7, and an S-wave is clearly visible within the
double-peaked proﬁles, likely due to the motion of the WD, on
which the disc is centred. To measure 𝐾1, the method of Shafter
(1983) was ﬁrst applied, which entails a Gaussian function ﬁtted
through the wings of the double-peaked H𝛽 line to determine the
central wavelength. However, this produced an inconclusive radial
velocity curve. Alternatively, two SplitGaussian functions were ﬁt-
ted to the double-peaked proﬁles from which average central wave-
lengths were calculated. The H𝛽 barycentric-corrected radial ve-
locity curve is shown in Fig. 8, and a sine function was ﬁtted (gray
curve in plot), giving a systemic velocity of 𝛾 = −16 ± 7 km s−1
and a semi-amplitude of 𝐾1 = 54 ± 10 km s−1. The dashed line in
Fig. 7 is the sine function ﬁtted to the radial velocity curve and used
to illustrate the S-wave.

4.2 QW Ser

The 2003–17 light curve of QW Ser (Fig. 1, middle panel) gives
an average 𝑉q ∼ 18 and reveals at least 24 outbursts with typical
amplitude of ∼ 5 mag. Using the same outburst criteria as mentioned
in Section 4.1, 6 were normal outbursts and 9 were superoutbursts.
The low observing cadence prevented us from identifying them
all. A duty cycle of ∼ 30 − 60 days and 𝑃sc ∼ 270 − 330 days
were determined, the latter longer than the 𝑃sc ∼ 220 − 270 days
determined by Nogami et al. (2004), indicating a decrease in (cid:164)𝑀2.

We observed QW Ser in August 2016 just before and during
an outburst, and followed it into quiescence; in 2017 it was ob-
served only in quiescence. The ﬁrst four runs of photometry and
spectroscopy in 2016 were conducted simultaneously and covered
the pre-outburst (4 August), outburst (8 August) and decline (9 – 10
August), making these the ﬁrst outburst spectra to be presented for
QW Ser.

Our photometry of QW Ser (Fig. 9) exploits the known 𝑃orb
(= 1.79 hr), but uses an arbitrary phase zero of the ﬁrst data point
of 4 August. The pre-outburst light curve (4 Aug) is noisy, as QW
Ser is then very faint (𝑉 ∼ 18), but does display variations similar
to those seen later in the outburst. On 8 August, it was ∼ 4.5
magnitudes brighter, likely close to outburst maximum, given the
typical amplitudes seen. No periodic features and little variability
are seen on this or the subsequent two nights, indicating it must be
a normal outburst, although a few fast variations were seen (marked
with gray arrows), the nature of which is unclear.

On 9 August QW Ser was fading at ∼ 0.06 mag hr−1 and
reached quiescence within a week (Fig. 10) at a mean rate of
0.68 mag day−1. The orbital modulation became visible on Au-
gust 12 and 14, as QW Ser approached quiescence. The lack of any
eclipses suggests an intermediate inclination of 𝑖 < 75◦.

Two humps of unequal amplitude were detected during one

quiescent orbital cycle (4 March). A Lomb-Scargle periodogram
indicated a period of 𝑃LS ∼ 0.92 ± 0.17 hr, i.e. half of ∼ 𝑃orb. The
humps suggest an observable hot spot, and further photometry in
quiescence is required to establish an ephemeris.

Our quiescent spectra of QW Ser on 23 February 2017 (Fig. 11,
bottom panel, is the best S/N spectrum obtained) show a typical
DN with H and He i emission lines. The double-peaked emission
proﬁles show the presence of an accretion disc. No secondary star
features were detected; however, the quiescent spectrum does have
broad absorption wings ﬂanking H𝛽, H𝛾 and H𝛿 emission, likely
originating from the hot WD.

The quiescent Balmer proﬁles from 4 August 2016 and
23 February 2017 (Fig. 12) indicate inner disc velocities of
∼ 2000 km s−1, based on the line wings. The peak separation
of ∼ 1400 km s−1 imply outer disc velocities of ∼ 700 km s−1. The
peak separation and ∨-shaped central reversal in the pre-outburst
spectrum (Fig. 12 (a)) is consistent with an optically thin accretion
disc viewed at an intermediate inclination. The asymmetrical peaks
in the H𝛼 and H𝛽 lines in Fig. 12 (b), are evidence of an observable
hot spot, as implied in our photometry.

The absorption lines visible in the outburst spectrum (Fig. 11,
8 Aug 2016) are typical of a hot, optically thick disc. As QW Ser
returned to quiescence, the disc cooled and became optically thin,
allowing for the emission lines to return, as seen in Fig. 11, 9–10
Aug 2016. The parameters we derived for QW Ser match previously
observed values.

4.3 V521 Peg

The composite light curve of V521 Peg (Jul 2003 – Nov 2019, Fig. 1
bottom panel) shows an average 𝑉q ∼ 17.2, in agreement with
Coppejans et al. (2016). Seventeen outbursts were detected with
an average outburst amplitude of ∼ 5 mag. To determine whether
they were normal or superoutbursts, the same outburst criteria in
Section 4.1 were applied and revealed 2 normal outbursts and 7 su-
peroutbursts, but the nature of the remainder could not be identiﬁed
due to the low observing cadence. Based on the superoutburst time
intervals, they recur on a timescale of 𝑃sc ∼ 320 − 350 days, longer
than the 𝑃sc ∼ 300 day supercycle determined by Patterson (2011),
and indicate a decrease in (cid:164)𝑀2. A normal outburst duty cycle could
not be determined. Despite the fact that the nature of not all the out-
bursts could be determined, the lack of normal outbursts supports
the “low-activity” observation of Aungwerojwit et al. (2006).

Our quiescent photometry of V521 Peg (8–9 Aug 2016) re-
vealed no eclipses (Fig. 13), but the double-hump structure on 9
August is indicative of a hot spot. Although not as well deﬁned as
that of RG05, the light curve does resemble the same double-hump
structure with two peaks of unequal amplitude.

The 9 August quiescent spectrum of V521 Peg (Fig. 14, top
panel) displayed double-peaked Balmer emission lines, indicating
an accretion disc viewed at moderate inclination. The Balmer emis-
sion lines were ﬂanked by broad absorption wings which are at-
tributed to the pressure-broadened features originating in the WD
photosphere. No late-type features from the secondary were de-
tected.

Fig. 15 shows the Balmer lines in the 9 August 2016 quiescent
spectrum, where the peaks are slightly asymmetrical, providing
evidence of a hot spot. The peak separation of ∼ 1200 km s−1
implies an outer disc edge velocity of ∼ 600 km s−1, in agreement
with that of RG05 (∼ 660 km s−1). The inner disc velocities close
to the WD of ∼ 1500 km s−1 were estimated from the wing limits,
but this should be considered a lower limit due to the diﬃculty in

and spectroscopy at Boyden and SAAO for the following three
nights (2–4 Sep, see Tables 2 and 3). Coincidentally the AAVSO
community and ASAS-SN also observed the source pre-outburst
and during the superoutburst, completing the dataset used here.

The overall light curve (Fig. 16) reveals that V521 Peg was
∼ 5 mag brighter in superoutburst than in quiescence. During the
plateau phase it declined at a rate of 0.1 mag day−1 and more rapidly
thereafter at 0.9 mag day−1, returning to quiescence within 10 days.
This superoutburst duration is shorter than that observed in 2003 by
RG05, where the plateau phase alone was longer than 10 days.

Fig. 16 shows that, in fact, V521 Peg was declining from a
normal outburst that led directly into the superoutburst. These pre-
cursor outbursts usually manifest as a small shoulder that evolves
quickly into the superoutburst (Cannizzo et al. 2010), however, the
detected dip in this case is unusual as it had declined almost 4
mag within a week before the onset of superoutburst. This is actu-
ally similar to well-separated precursor outbursts observed for other
standard SU UMa systems, e.g. VW Hyi (Bateson 1977), V1504
Cyg and V344 Lyr (Osaki & Kato 2014), and CS Ind (Kato et al.
2019), with the latter included in Fig. 16 (light blue data points) to
demonstrate their similarity. Osaki & Kato (2014) proposed that the
well-separated precursor outbursts are due to the slow growth of the
tidal instability that can survive quiescence and eventually trigger
the superoutburst. They also pointed out that the interval between
well-separated precursor outbursts and the superoutbursts (i.e. time
between maximum magnitudes) for high- (cid:164)𝑀2 systems is ∼ 4 − 5
days, while for low- (cid:164)𝑀2 systems it is 10 − 11 days. This interval for
V521 Peg is a minimum of ∼ 8 days since the date of maximum
magnitude of the precursor outburst is unknown, hence indicating
that V521 Peg is a low (cid:164)𝑀2-system.

Figure 6. H𝛽 proﬁles in binned spectra of AR Pic on 26 Feb 2017 show a
changing asymmetry of the double peak, likely due to an accretion hot spot.
The plots are oﬀset by an arbitrary constant and are in phase order (labelled
on the right). The dotted lines indicate the peak velocities, giving a peak
separation of ∼ 1200 km s−1; the dashed lines indicate the line wings at

deﬁning the edges of these features. The ∨-shaped central reversal
at the peak is typical of an optically thick accretion disc viewed at
an intermediate inclination (Horne & Marsh 1986).

During observations on 1 September 2017 we found V521 Peg
to be in outburst, and therefore undertook simultaneous photometry

The presence of superhumps during the plateau phase (Fig. 17)
conﬁrmed that it was indeed a superoutburst, and they drifted as

observers use a range of cameras with diﬀerent responses, there
will likely be small systematic diﬀerences present. The Boyden
data were binned in steps of two 10 sec frames in order to smooth
the light curves. A maximum superhump amplitude of ∼ 0.3 mag
was observed on 31 August and subsequently decreased.

thin, allowing the emission lines to return. The spectra of 9 and 10 Aug are multiplied by a factor of 2 to amplify features. Bottom panel: Spectrum of QW Ser

4.4 Orbital period - Supercycle relation

Having determined the times between consecutive superoutbursts
(𝑃sc) using the archival data for our targets, it is interesting to ex-

amine the relation between 𝑃sc and 𝑃orb for those SU UMa-systems
and related objects where these parameters are known. By com-
bining catalogue data (Otulakowska-Hypka et al. 2016) with our
composite light curves (Fig. 1), we produced Fig. 19 (top panel)
where we have also included the WZ Sge and ER UMa systems.
Note that the three subclasses inhabit diﬀerent, clearly deﬁned re-
gions of this plot. The WZ-type (red squares) have extremely rare
superoutbursts (𝑃sc > 800 days) and are concentrated close to
the ‘period minimum‘ of ∼80 mins. In comparison, the ER-type
(blue triangles) have extremely frequent super and normal outbursts
(𝑃sc ∼ 20 − 100 days) and yet are spread over a much wider range
of 𝑃orb. The SU-type (black and gray circles) occupy the “middle
ground” between these types. A linear function was ﬁtted to the 81
SU UMa data points below the ‘period gap’ (𝑃orb < 2 hrs), utiliz-
ing Python scipy.stats.linregress to calculate a linear least-squares

Spectra of V521 Peg obtained during a pre-cursor outburst (27 Aug 2017 - note that this was observed at high airmass and could not be reliably ﬂuxed) and a
superoutburst (1 Sep 2017). The spectra of 9 Aug 2016 and 27 Aug 2017 are multiplied by a factor of 20 to amplify features. The double-peaked emission lines
(9 Aug) are evidence of an accretion disc. The absorption features in the superoutburst spectra indicate that the disc is optically thick during superoutburst. H𝛼
is almost undetectable in the 1 Sep spectrum as it consists of an absorption line with a superimposed emission component.

1995, Fig. 9.8). Equation (2) is plotted as the blue line in Fig. 19
(top panel) and shows that SU-type sources tend towards increasing
𝑃sc at shorter 𝑃orb. Our 𝑃sc − 𝑃orb plot is also consistent with the
recent results of (Vogt et al. 2021, Fig. 1) who did not perform any
ﬁts to their data.

Angular momentum loss in close binary systems causes most
CVs, after they emerge from the ‘period gap’, to evolve down to a
‘period minimum’ of 𝑃orb,min ∼70 – 80 min before they start to
evolve back to longer orbital periods (see Rappaport et al. 2017,
and references therein). Detailed calculations of CV evolution (e.g.
Knigge et al. 2011) show that, after a spike in the mass trans-
(cid:164)𝑀2 quickly settles to
fer rate on emerging from the period gap,
∼ 10−10 M(cid:12) yr−1 and gradually declines as the CV evolves to
𝑃orb,min. It has been suggested (e.g. Kato et al. 2013a, who pro-
duce a similar plot to our Fig. 19 top panel, but using 𝑃sh instead
of 𝑃orb), that this decline in (cid:164)𝑀2 will reduce the rate of accumula-
tion of matter in the disc, and hence increase the intervals between
superoutbursts. We included the mass transfer rate ( (cid:164)𝑀2) – orbital
period (𝑃orb) relation of the revised evolution model for DNe given
by Knigge et al. (2011, Fig. 19) in the bottom panel of our Fig. 19
(orange line). This revised model demonstrates that the mass trans-
fer rate decreases as the system evolves to shorter orbital periods,
hence resulting in a reduction of the rate of accumulation of matter
in the disc, and leading to an increase in 𝑃sc.

The clear distinction between the SU-type and WZ/ER sub-
classes in terms of their diﬀerent supercycle times close to 𝑃orb,min,
indicates that the mass transfer rates are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for
each subclass. Actually, the SU UMa systems with the shortest
𝑃orb appear to blend very smoothly into the WZ Sge systems, fur-
ther strengthening their combination into a single class (e.g. Kato

By performing a t-test on our data we ﬁnd that it rejects the null
hypothesis slope of zero at a 3𝜎 conﬁdence level (99.7%); we
cannot undertake a standard goodness-of-ﬁt analysis because the
catalogue data do not include uncertainties in the 𝑃sc values. DT Pyx
(𝑃orb = 88.78 min, 𝑃sc = 1500 days) was excluded from our ﬁt,
as while it is classiﬁed as a SU-type, its 𝑃sc value is above the
SU-type range, and puts it much closer to a WZ-type. It also has
a quiescent MV = +11.4 which is comparable with WZ-types and
fainter than the typical SU-type (e.g. Warner 1987, Fig. 3; Warner

so much higher in the ER UMa systems.

In an eﬀort to determine the distinguishing factor between
the subclasses, we looked at the distance between the secondary’s
photosphere and the L1 funnel through which material ﬂows, as a
contributing factor. In this context, the mass transfer rate can be

with 𝜌phot representing the photospheric density of a late-type star,
and is ∼ 10−6 g cm−3 (e.g. Warner 1995, p. 34; Frank et al. 2002,

dwarf stars, the mass transfer rates were calculated using diﬀerent
scale height factors (𝛼) determined by

where 𝑅2 is the secondary’s Roche lobe radius, 𝑅∗ the photospheric
radius, and 𝐻p = 𝑐2
∗/𝐺 𝑀2 is the stellar scale height. Hence, a
small distance between the photosphere and L1 will result in a small
𝛼, whereas a large distance will give a large 𝛼.

The mass transfer rates for various 𝛼 values (2 ≤ 𝛼 ≥ 5)

factors (𝛼 ∼ 2−3) result in high (cid:164)𝑀2, whereas the higher scaleheight

factors (𝛼 ∼ 4 − 5) result in lower

from SU/WZ-types. The mass transfer rates for 𝛼 ∼ 4 (typical
for SU-types) compare well with the revised evolution model of

WZ Sge-type system.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Long-term archival monitoring (with CRTS, AAVSO, ASAS-SN
and ASAS-3) has allowed us to estimate their supercycle recurrence
times (𝑃sc) and we determined that 𝑃sc has increased for QW Ser
and V521 Peg, indicating a decreasing (cid:164)𝑀2 in these systems. For AR
Pic, 𝑃sc was only better constrained and requires further long-term
monitoring to determine if there is a change in 𝑃sc. Optical pho-
tometry and spectroscopy of our three target dwarf novae covering
quiescence, normal and super-outbursts has shown the characteris-
tic properties of SU UMa-systems. Although a change in 𝑃sc was
detected for QW Ser, it’s outburst properties did not deviate from
previous outbursts. V521 Peg, however, exhibited an uncommon
well-separated precursor outburst that preceded a superoutburst,
the latter not lasting as long as a previous recorded superoutburst.
We combined our 𝑃sc results with the catalogued 𝑃sc for all
short-period dwarf novae, showing a possible relation between 𝑃orb
and 𝑃sc, whereby 𝑃sc increases as 𝑃orb decreases. This is a direct
consequence of the declining mass transfer rate as systems evolve
toward the ‘period minimum’, hence reducing the accumulation of
matter in the disc and increasing the time to the next superoutburst.
We also showed that the distance between the secondary’s photo-
sphere and the L1 point, directly inﬂuencing (cid:164)𝑀2, may be the factor
that distinguish the three SU UMa subclasses from each other. By
comparing AR Pic, QW Ser and V521 Peg to other systems in the
orbital period (𝑃orb) - supercycle (𝑃sc) relation, we have determined
that they are still evolving toward the ‘period minimum’ and that
V521 Peg is close to evolving into a WZ Sge system.

Figure 19. Top panel: Orbital period (𝑃orb) - Supercycle (𝑃sc) relation for
SU UMa (black and gray circles), ER UMa (pale blue triangles) and WZ
Sge-type (red squares) systems. Values obtained from Otulakowska-Hypka
et al. 2016 and include AR Pic (green triangle pointing right), QW Ser
(green triangle pointing left) and V521 Peg (green diamond) with updated
𝑃sc. The blue line is the linear ﬁt to the SU UMa-type systems with 𝑃orb <
120 min (black circles), and indicates an increase in 𝑃sc as 𝑃orb decreases.
Bottom panel: The orange line is the mass transfer rate ( (cid:164)𝑀2) – Orbital period
(𝑃orb) relation of the revised evolution model for DNe given by Knigge et al.
(2011, Fig. 19). The red, black, green and blue lines represent the (cid:164)𝑀2 – 𝑃orb
relation given in Eq. 3 for diﬀerent values of 𝛼 (2 ≤ 𝛼 ≥ 5).

Knigge et al. (2011). It has long been suspected that WZ-types are
evolving through the ‘period minimum’ (e.g Hellier 2001, p. 90)
and becoming ‘period bouncers’. The grouping of these systems
(cid:164)𝑀2 < 0.4 ×
in Fig. 19 (top panel) compares well with the lowest
10−10 M(cid:12) yr−1 branch of the Knigge (2011) model (Fig. 19, bottom
panel). This suggests that WZ-types are evolving from a scaleheight
factor of 𝛼 ∼ 4 towards 𝛼 ∼ 5.

For systems that have reached 𝑃orb,min, the donor can no longer
support H-burning and it starts to become degenerate (e.g. Hellier
2001, p. 53, and references therein). These stars have convective
envelopes with a typical adiabatic index of 𝜁 = −0.2 (e.g. Meintjes
2002, and references therein), and expands according to the M-R
relationship for degenerate secondary stars, i.e. 𝑅 ∝ 𝑀−𝛽 (𝛽 ∼ 0.8;
e.g. Hamada & Salpeter 1961; Eracleous & Horne 1996) maintain-
ing Roche contact to transfer mass at much lower rates. To conserve
angular momentum, the system expands which leads to an expand-
ing Roche lobe. These ‘post-bounce’ donors are of much lower mass
(cid:164)𝑀2, making these CVs
(≤ 0.05M(cid:12)) and so provide a much lower
much fainter.

AR Pic, QW Ser and V521 Peg are included in Fig. 19 (top
panel) and their positions show that they are still evolving toward
the ‘period minimum’. AR Pic and QW Ser will remain SU UMa
sources for a long time to come, however, V521 Peg is within the
region that overlaps with WZ Sge sources. The photometric and
spectroscopic results of V521 Peg show that it has characteristics
of both SU UMa (precursor outburst comparable with SU-types)
and WZ Sge types (lack of normal outbursts, superoutburst spec-
trum similar to WZ Sge). This might support the argument that
SU UMa and WZ Sge-types are a single class (e.g. Kato 2015),
however, the diﬀerent scaleheight factors for these subclasses can
be a distinguishing factor and perhaps cast doubt on the single class
