ABSTRACT

We study the optical emission from heavy element ejecta in the oxygen-rich young supernova remnant
(SNR) 1E 0102.2-7219 (1E 0102) in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We have used the Multi-Unit Spectro-
scopic Explorer (MUSE) optical integral ﬁeld spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) on Cerro
Paranal and the wide ﬁeld spectrograph (WiFeS) at the ANU 2.3 m telescope at Siding Spring Obser-
vatory to obtain deep observations of 1E 0102. Our observations cover the entire extent of the remnant
from below 3500Å to 9350Å. Our observations unambiguously reveal the presence of fast-moving ejecta
emitting in [S ii], [S iii], [Ar iii], and [Cl ii]. The sulfur-rich ejecta appear more asymmetrically distributed
compared to oxygen or neon, a product of carbon-burning. In addition to the forbidden line emission from
products of oxygen burning (S, Ar, Cl), we have also discovered Hα and Hβ emission from several knots
of low surface brightness, fast-moving ejecta. The presence of fast-moving hydrogen points towards a
progenitor that had not entirely shed its hydrogen envelope prior to the supernova. The explosion that
gave rise to 1E 0102 is therefore commensurate with a Type IIb supernova.

Introduction

Core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe) mark the spectacular end of nuclear fusion processes within massive stars.
Following the gravitational collapse of the stellar core and the subsequent explosion of the star as a supernova, freshly
synthesized heavy elements are ejected at high velocity into the surrounding medium, thereby creating a super-
nova remnant (SNR). For the rare class of “oxygen-rich” (O-rich) supernova remnants (OSNRs), with typical ages
(cid:46)3, 000 years, the composition and spatial distribution of the stellar ejecta can be studied directly via the optical emis-
sion of its shock-heated atoms. These ejecta are detected at optical wavelengths primarily via the [O iii] λλ4959,5007

lines (but see also Blair et al. 2000), following their encounter at a few 1000 km s−1 with the reverse shock (Suther-
land & Dopita 1995). OSNRs thus oﬀer extraordinary windows into the explosion mechanisms and nucleosynthesis
conditions of CC SNe, uniquely enabling the three-dimensional reconstruction of the ejecta morphology (e.g., Vogt &
Dopita 2010, 2011; Vogt et al. 2017b) and its composition, providing direct constraints for hydrodynamical explosion
models (e.g., Wongwathanarat et al. 2017). Only a handful of such OSNRs are known: the most prominent examples
include Cassiopeia A, Puppis A, and G292.2+1.8 in our own Galaxy, a remnant in the galaxy NGC 4449 (Blair et
al. 1984), N132D and 0540–69.3 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and 1E 0102.2–7219 (hereafter 1E 0102)
in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The latter was discovered in Einstein soft X-ray observations of the SMC by
Seward & Mitchell (1981), who found it to be the second brightest X-ray source in the SMC. Dopita et al. (1981)
classiﬁed 1E 0102 as an OSNR. Here, we report the discovery of optical emission from high-velocity supernova ejecta
in 1E 0102 enriched in a number of elements not previously identiﬁed in 1E 0102, namely hydrogen, sulfur, argon, and
chlorine.

2. Detection of sulfur-rich ejecta

We observed 1E 0102 with the WiFeS Integral Field Spectrograph on the 2.3 m telescope of Siding Spring Ob-
servatory on 2016 August 7 and 2016 August 8. In the reduced datacube we unambiguously detected faint, highly
Doppler-shifted [S ii]λλ6716, 6731 emission (see Fig. 1a), associated with the ejecta of this OSNR (see also Seitenzahl
et al. 2017). Following this discovery, we performed follow-up observations of 1E 0102 using the Multi-Unit Spec-
troscopic Explorer (MUSE) in Service Mode at the Very Large Telescope on the night of 2016 October 7, as part of
Director Discretionary Time (DDT) program 297.D-5058 (P.I.: F.P.A. Vogt) for 9 × 900 s exposures on-source. For
details of the observations and the data reduction see Vogt et al. (2017a). In the [S ii] images of 1E 0102 extracted
from the MUSE datacube, the smaller pixel scale of the MUSE data compared to WiFeS (0.2
per
spaxel) allows a much ﬁner discernment of the spatial distribution of S-rich ejecta relative to the O-rich ejecta (e.g.,
Fig. 1a,c). The MUSE imagery shows that the [S ii] emission is patchy and asymmetric, aligning with localized seg-
ments of [O iii]-emitting material along the eastern, western and central regions. The sulfur-rich ejecta is detected at
Doppler shifts ranging from −1776 km s−1 to +958 km s−1 (Fig. 2a). In some of the brighter regions, [S iii] λ9069,
[Ar iii]λ7136, and [Cl ii] λ8579 are also detected at consistent Doppler velocities (see Fig. 3).

(cid:48)(cid:48)

These data are the ﬁrst detection in the optical of the long sought-after (Lasker & Golimowski 1991; Blair et al.
2000) products of oxygen-burning in the ejecta of the supernova that gave rise to 1E 0102. Fitted line ﬂuxes (and some
upper limits) of the brightest sulfur-rich knot (region 1 in Fig. 1) are given in Table 1 for a selection of emission lines.

3. Discovery of the fast-moving hydrogen

Aside from the sulfur-rich emission, we also discovered several distinct high velocity knots emitting in the Balmer
lines of hydrogen (see Fig. 1f, Fig. 2b, and Fig 4.). This Balmer emission is also observed from both blue-shifted
and red-shifted material. The velocity shifts of the Hα and Hβ lines agree with the Doppler shifts of other prominent
identiﬁed lines from the same extraction region, giving conﬁdence in the line identiﬁcation and that the knots are indeed
high-velocity hydrogen-rich ejecta. The hydrogen-rich ejecta is detected at Doppler shifts ranging from −1785 km s−1
to +786 km s−1(Fig. 2b). Interestingly, the distribution of the Balmer-line emission somewhat correlates with the [S ii]
and to a lesser extent [O iii] emission (cf. Fig. 1d,e,f and Fig. 2a,b). Comparison with the WiFeS data shows that
emission from these lines also coincides with [Ne iii]λ3889 near the center (see Fig. 1b). Fitted line ﬂuxes (and some
upper limits) of the prominent Balmer-line emitting knot in the south (region 2 in Fig. 1) are given in Table 1 for a

selection of emission lines.

4. Shock model calculations

We have constructed cloud shock models for region 1 and 2 using the MAPPINGS V code with self-consistent
pre-ionisation as described by Sutherland & Dopita (2017). The structure of these O-rich shocks is quite diﬀerent from
those of normal plasmas (Itoh 1981; Dopita et al. 1984; Sutherland & Dopita 1995). First, in the post-shock region, the
plasma cools very quickly, so that colliesional ionisation is never reached, and the plasma cools below 1000 K before
signiﬁcant recombination to un-ionised states has occurred. Second, the ionising photon production in these shocks is
high, so that they produce photoionised precursors. In these the time-dependence of the ionisation is very important.
Initially, the incoming plasma is exposed to hard photons left over from maintaining ionisation in the precursor, and
the fractional ionisation is very low. As a consequence, the photo-heating much exceeds to cooling provided by the
few electrons, and the plasma is strongly super-heated. This is the region which dominates the emission of the low-
ionisation species. As the plasma becomes more fully ionised in its passage towards the shock front, the cooling
dominates the photo-heating, and the plasma falls towards its equilibrium temperature of ∼ 100 − 200 K. In these
shocks, the forbidden line emission from the leading edge of the photoionised precursor zone may be as important, or
more important than the forbidden line emission from the cooling region of the shock itself.

To model regions 1 and 2 we have used the iterative approach described by Sutherland & Dopita (2017) to model
both regions. The observed ratios of [O i] to [O ii] to [O iii] constrain the shock velocities to be relatively low, 30 –
100 km s−1, consistent with the model in which the O-rich knots arise in relatively dense ejecta passing through the
reverse shock. The best ﬁt model requires a mixture of shock velocities to be present, as might be expected if there
exist variations in the pre-shock density in the shocked cloud. For Region 1, we mixed shock velocities between 50
and 90 km s−1 to produce a satisfactory ﬁt, while for Region 2 the range of velocities required to produce a good ﬁt
was smaller; 40 – 50 km s−1. For the Region 1 best-ﬁt model, the pre-shock density is ∼1.8 × 10−21g cm−3, while for
Region 2, the pre-shock density is ∼5.4×10−22g cm−3. Those correspond to ionic densities of 230 cm−3 and 22.2 cm−3,
respectively.

In all of the models the magnetic parameter α, the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the gas pressure in the
precursor was taken to be unity. We note that the assumption of magnetic pressure equal to the gas pressure in the
shock precursor is one of energy equipartition, which will be strictly valid in a turbulent precursor medium. However,
since the gas in the far precursor region is at very low temperature, a few tens of degrees K, this assumption is almost
equivalent to the low-magnetic ﬁeld limit in the shock. The precursor magnetic ﬁeld would have to be much higher
to appreciably aﬀect the results presented here, which seems to be unphysical. Therefore, our results are only weakly
dependent on the exact value of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Since the spectrum is dominated by emission from oxygen, we adjusted the abundances of the other observed
elements relative to O, For Region 1 we estimate the following abundances log(H/O) ∼ −1.4, log(N/O) (cid:46) −4.5,
log(S/O) = −1.8, log(Cl/O) = −3.5, and log(Ar/O) = −2.3. While for Region 2, we derive log(H/O) = −1.0,
log(N/O) (cid:46) −5.0, and log(S/O) = −4.5. Typical errors on these ﬁgures are of order 0.2 – 0.3 dex.

5. Discussion and Conclusions

Chevalier (2005) argue that 1E 0102 is the remnant of a Type IIL/b supernova with a progenitor that lost most
(but not all) of the H envelope before the explosion. The very low surface brightness of the Balmer emission makes

– 4 –

a Type IIL progenitor implausible, but a Type IIb supernova type for 1E 0102 would place this remnant in the same
category as the (in many regards similar) OSNRs Cas A and Puppis A. Indeed, fast hydrogen-rich knots, similar to
those we report here, were discovered both in Cas A – known to stem from a Type IIb SN from light echo studies
(Krause et al. 2008) – by Fesen et al. (1988) and Fesen & Becker (1991), and Puppis A (Winkler & Kirshner 1985),
which Chevalier (2005) also assigned to a Type IIL/b SN progenitor. The high velocities of these features in Cas A
(∼6000 km s−1) led Fesen et al. (1988) and Fesen & Becker (1991) to the conclusion that the hydrogen originated in
the outermost photospheric region of Cas A’s progenitor, where the outﬂow velocities are highest. We note that the
hydrogen-rich features in 1E 0102 exhibit somewhat lower Doppler shifts, up to about -1785 km s−1.

Notably, we do not observe any emission from [N ii] (see upper limits for region 2 in Table 1), neither associated
with the Balmer line emitting knots as is the case for Cas A (Fesen et al. 1988) nor in N-rich ﬁlaments as observed
for Puppis A (Winkler et al. 1989). For Cas A, [N ii]λ6583/Hα > 6 in many of the FMF, which in turn implies
a nitrogen abundance of at least 10 times solar (Fesen et al. 1988, 2001).
In stark contrast, in region 2 we ﬁnd
[N ii]λ6583/Hα < 0.014 (see Table 1), which is at least a factor of 6/0.014 = 429 lower than for the FMF in Cas A.
This does not, however, imply a low nitrogen abundance relative to hydrogen. Our shock models indicate that very
low shock speeds (40 − 50 km s−1) are required to reproduce the observed spectrum in region 2. The approximately
solar nitrogen to hydrogen ratio assumed for this calculation results in a line intensity of [N ii]λ6583 well below the
observational upper limit and even a super-solar nitrogen to hydrogen ratio of twice the solar value, ∼8 × 10−5 (e.g.
Lodders 2003) could be accommodated.

In addition to the new detections of fast-moving Balmer emission and S-rich material, we have also detected
emission from argon ([Ar iii]λ7136) and chlorine ([Cl ii]λ8579). The abundances for our shock model that reproduces
the spectrum for region 1 reasonably well (see Table 1 and Section 4) indicate a strong enhancement relative to H
of O, S, Ar, and Cl. Using Russell & Dopita (1992), we ﬁnd enrichments in region 1 of 105.37≈235, 000 times
the ISM abundance of the SMC for oxygen, 105.01≈100, 000 times SMC for sulfur, 105.20≈160, 000 times the ISM
abundance of the SMC for chlorine, and 105.29≈195, 000 times SMC for argon. The enhancement of products of
oxygen-burning (e.g., S, Cl, and Ar) indicates that nuclear fusion has partially proceeded past the previously known
elements associated with explosive burning of the neon-carbon shell, i.e., C, Ne, O, and Mg. The enhancement in
region 2 is less pronounced, with an over-abundance of sulfur relative to hydrogen of ∼200 times the SMC value
(Russell & Dopita 1992), and argon and chlorine not detected.

The sulfur-rich ejecta appears more asymmetrically distributed than oxygen/neon and correlates with the hydro-
gen emission. The discovery of the fast hydrogen containing knots implies that the progenitor star retained part of
its hydrogen envelope up moments before the supernova explosion. This makes a Wolf-Rayet progenitor of a Type
Ib or Type Ic supernova unlikely for 1E 0102. Based on the newly discovered fast-moving Balmer-line emission, we
therefore favor a Type IIb supernova progenitor that was stripped of most – but not all – of its hydrogen envelope,
possibly via interaction with a close companion star.

Notes:
aWe are quoting 1σ statistical errors of the Gaussian ﬁt. Note that in cases of strong lines with very high signal to
noise, such as e.g. [O iii], systematic uncertainties dominate and the statistical errors under-estimate the total uncer-
tainty of the observed line ﬂux.
bA meaningful upper limit could not be determined in this case as the Doppler shift puts [N ii] 6583 on top of Hα.
cNot included in the MAPPINGS V shock model calculations, either because the upper limit does not lead to mean-
ingful constraints or the line is not included in the code.
