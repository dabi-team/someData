A giant dark channel across the solar equator consisting of two
ﬁlament channels with diﬀerent chiralities

Zhiping Song1, Yijun Hou2,3, and Jun Zhang2,3

ABSTRACT

Solar ﬁlaments are the largest magnetic structure that can be physically
traced to the chromosphere. The structure and evolution of solar ﬁlaments are
important for our understanding of solar atmosphere physics. In this work, we
investigate a giant dark channel crossing the solar equator, which consists of
two ﬁlament channels with diﬀerent chiralities. From 2016 April 22 to April 27,
this giant dark channel occupied the solar disk. Within this giant channel, a
ﬁlament channel with dextral chirality was detected in the northern hemisphere,
and another ﬁlament channel with sinistral chirality was observed in the southern
hemisphere. At the junction of the two ﬁlament channels, a cusp structure was
observed associated with active region (AR) 12532 near the solar equator. The
extrapolated three-dimensional magnetic ﬁelds reveal that this cusp structure
was composed of two sets of ﬁeld lines belonging to two diﬀerent ﬁlament chan-
nels and was rooted on the AR positive-polarity ﬁelds. In addition, dark material
ﬂows from ﬁlaments in the two channels to the cusp structure were detected as
well as the ﬂux emergence and cancellation around the cusp footpoints. On 2016
May 21, after a solar rotation, the cusp structure had disappeared, and the giant
dark channel broke in the middle where another AR, 12546, had emerged com-
pletely. We propose that the magnetic ﬂux emergence and cancellation around
the cusp region resulted in the disappearance of the cusp structure and the break
of the giant dark channel.

Introduction

Solar ﬁlaments consist of dense and cool plasma suspended in the hot solar corona with
their lower part in the chromosphere. On the solar disk, they show up in absorption as
elongated and dark ribbons. But when seen above the solar limb, they appear as bright
features against the dark background and are called prominences. The terms “ﬁlament” and
“prominence” are often interchangeably used in literature. In terms of the ﬁlaments’ spatial
location on the Sun (Engvold 1998), we classiﬁed them as active region ﬁlaments (inside the
active regions), intermediate ﬁlament (at the border of active regions), and quiescent ﬁlament
(on the quiet Sun). Filaments are typically composed of a spine, barbs, and two extreme
ends (Mackay et al. 2010). The earliest magnetograph observations (Babcock & Babcock
1955) showed that the ﬁlaments lie between diﬀerent polarities of the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld,
located above polarity inversion lines (PILs).

Filament channels are unique sites where ﬁlaments form in the sun, where the chro-
mospheric ﬁbrils are aligned with the PIL (Martres et al. 1966; Gaizauskas 1998). These
ﬁbrils show the existence of the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld with the same direction on the two
sides of the channel (Foukal 1971; Leroy et al. 1983; Martin et al. 1992). A handedness
property known as “chirality” has been discovered for ﬁlament channels, ﬁlaments, and their
overlying coronal arcades. Martin et al. (1994) proposed that the chirality of a ﬁlament
channel is deﬁned as dextral if the axial magnetic ﬁeld is directed to the right when viewed
from the positive polarity side of the channel. Conversely, it is deﬁned as sinistral if the axial
magnetic ﬁeld viewed from the positive polarity side is directed to the left. Since magnetic
ﬁelds in ﬁlament channel are believed to extend to coronal heights embedding the ﬁlaments,
the chirality classiﬁcation applies to the ﬁlaments as well. And there is a one-to-one cor-
relation that ﬁlaments in dextral channels have right-bearing barbs, and those in sinistral
channels have left-bearing barbs. Martin & McAllister (1996) studied the coronal arcades
overlying ﬁlaments and found that left-skewed arcades always lie above dextral ﬁlaments
while right-skewed arcades exist over sinistral ﬁlaments, opposite to the right (left)-bearing
structure of the ﬁlament barbs. Sheeley et al. (2013) proposed another chirality identiﬁ-
cation method to infer the chirality of ﬁlament channels by using coronal cells in extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) 193 ˚A images (Sheeley & Warren 2012). Recently, Chen et al. (2014) and
Ouyang et al. (2017) determined the chiralities of erupting ﬁlaments according to the skew-
ness of the conjugate ﬁlament drainage sites. The ﬁlament chirality follows a hemispheric
pattern that the dextral ﬁlaments dominate in the northern hemisphere and sinistral in the
southern hemisphere (Martin et al. 1994; Zirker et al. 1997; Pevtsov et al. 2003).

Previous works revealed that ﬁlaments or associated channels sometimes interact with
each other and show interesting characteristics in the chromosphere and low corona (Bone

– 3 –

et al. 2009; Kumar et al. 2010; Li & Ding 2012; Jiang et al. 2014; Joshi et al. 2016;
Xue et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2017). Observations and simulations have shown that these
magnetic structures can reconnect and exchange their footpoint connectivity, which is known
as “slingshot” reconnection (Linton et al. 2001; Chandra et al. 2011; T¨or¨ok et al. 2011;
Jiang et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2017). Some authors have also presented observations where
ﬁlaments of the same chirality could merge to form one longer ﬁlament (Schmieder et al.
2004; Su et al. 2007; Joshi et al. 2014; Zhu et al. 2015). Numerical simulations also showed
that two ﬁlaments occupying a single PIL in a bipolar large-scale magnetic conﬁguration
could easily merged into a single prominence if their chiralities were same and the axial
magnetic ﬁelds were aligned (DeVore et al. 2005; Aulanier et al. 2006). Martin et al. (1994)
proposed that two ﬁlaments with diﬀerent chiralities cannot merge into a single one and
a cusp could be formed at the ends of the two ﬁlaments where they meet. Schmieder et
al. (2004) observed a cusp-shape structure formed by the adjoining ends of two separate
ﬁlaments with opposite chiralities.

From 2016 April 22 to April 27, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO; Pesnell et al.
2012) detected a giant dark channel on the solar disk in EUV passbands, which spanned
from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere. Within this giant dark channel,
we identify a dextral ﬁlament channel in the northern hemisphere and a sinistral ﬁlament
channel in the southern hemisphere. Additionally, at the junction of these two ﬁlament
channels near the solar equator, a cusp structure was observed. Dark material ﬂows from
the ﬁlaments within the two ﬁlament channels to the cusp structure were also detected. The
remainder of the paper is as follows: Section 2 deals with the description of the observations
and data analysis used in this study. The giant dark channel consisting of two ﬁlament
channels with diﬀerent chiralities, the cusp structure at the junction of the two ﬁlament
channels, the material ﬂows in the ﬁlaments within these two channels, and the evolutions
of the cusp and the giant dark channel are presented in Section 3. Finally, we conclude this
work and discuss the results in Section 4.

2. Observations and Data Analysis

The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen et al. 2012) on board the SDO suc-
cessively observes multilayered solar atmosphere, including the photosphere, chromosphere,
transition region, and corona, in ten passbands, seven of which are in the EUV and observed
with a cadence of 12 s and a spatial resolution of 1.′′2. From 2016 April 22 to April 27, a
giant dark channel was observed over the solar disk spanning from the northern hemisphere
to the southern hemisphere in AIA EUV wavelengths. During this period, we adopt the full-

– 4 –

disk observations of the AIA 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, and 211 ˚A to show this channel. Meanwhile, the
line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI; Schou
et al. 2012) with a time cadence of 45 s and a pixel scale of 0.′′5 are employed to exhibit the
underlying magnetic ﬁelds. The similar data are taken on 2016 May 21 to show this giant
channel after a solar rotation cycle. For the vector magnetic ﬁelds, the HMI data product
called Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP; Bobra et al. 2014) are used
as well. To investigate the chromosphere conﬁguration of the associated ﬁlaments, we also
employ corresponding Hα observations from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG;
Harvey et al. 2011). GONG has collected Hα images observed at seven sites around the
world since mid-2010 and provides successive global Hα observations online.

In order to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic ﬁelds of the cusp struc-
ture, we perform nonlinear force-free ﬁeld (NLFFF) extrapolations based on the “weighted
optimization” method (Wiegelmann 2004; Wiegelmann et al. 2012). The vector magne-
tograms are preprocessed by a procedure developed by Wiegelmann et al. (2006) to satisfy
the force-free condition before being used as boundary condition. The NLFFF extrapolation
is performed in a box of 624 × 264 × 256 uniformly spaced grid points (227 × 96 × 93
Mm3).

3. Results

3.1. A Giant Dark Channel Across the Solar Equator Consisting of Two

Filament Channels with Diﬀerent Chiralities

On 2016 April 24, a giant dark channel occupied the solar disk with a shape of fallen
“U”, which spanned from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere. Figure 1(a)
shows the overview of this channel in composite image of 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A, and 211 ˚A. In these
EUV passbands, the giant channel manifested as an elongated and dark region. In panel
(b), we exhibit the corresponding LOS magnetogram to check magnetic ﬁelds underneath
this channel. It’s revealed that the elongated series of dark regions lay on the PIL regions
on a global scale. Specially, near the bottom of this “U” shape, that is the bend of this
channel, a distinct cusp-shaped structure was observed. Around this cusp structure, there
was an active region (AR) NOAA 12532. In the bend, the eastern side of the giant channel
was dominated by the negative ﬁelds, and the western side was dominantly positive, which
was close to the positive polarity side of AR 12532.

A cusp structure, although not commonly seen, is widely considered to be formed be-
tween close ends of two ﬁlament channels or ﬁlaments with opposite chiralities (Martin et

– 5 –

al. 1994; Schmieder et al. 2004). In present work, we detect a distinct cusp structure (see
Figure 1(a)) in the bend of the dark channel near the solar equator on days from 2016 April
22 to April 26, which implies there were two ﬁlament channels (see FC1 and FC2 in Figure
1) with opposite chiralities within the elongated dark region and that they interacted with
each other near the solar equator. To look for evidence of ﬁlament channels within the giant
dark regions, we apply the method proposed by Sheeley et al. (2013) to infer the chirality
of ﬁlament channels based on the coronal cells deﬁnition in SDO/AIA 193 ˚A images. We
select two areas located in the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere (see the white
parallelograms in Figure 1(a)) to investigate the two ﬁlament channels, which are shown in
Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

Figure 2 displays AIA 193 ˚A image (top) and HMI LOS magnetogram (bottom) obtained
from the selected region outlined by the white dotted parallelogram in Figure 1(a) when it
was around the central meridian on 2016 April 23. The 193 ˚A image used here has been
constructed by normalizing the exposure time and averaging images over a 5-minute interval
to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.
It’s shown that the ﬁlament channel (FC1) is the
elongated dark region following approximately northeast-southwest along the PIL of the
photospheric ﬁeld. Coronal cells are visible on the negative side of FC1 and aﬀected by the
spine magnetic ﬁeld in the channel. On the negative polarity side of this ﬁlament channel,
these cells are stretched into tadpole shape with their heads rooted in the majority polarity
and their tails bending southwestward along the channel. We denote one of these cells by blue
circle (head) and arrow (tail). Because these cellular plumes are rooted in negative magnetic
ﬁeld and their tails point to the southwest, we conclude that the axial magnetic ﬁeld of FC1
shown in this ﬁgure is directed to the northeast along the PIL. This corresponds to a dextral
chirality, which is consistent with the dominant chirality in the northern hemisphere.

Figure 3 shows a southern-hemisphere region marked by the white dashed parallelogram
in Figure 1(a) on April 23. In this region, the ﬁlament channel (FC2) is directed southeast-
northwest along the PIL. Several coronal cells are visible on the negative-polarity side of the
channel. We mark one of these cells similar to that in Figure 2. It is shown that this cell is
rooted in concentration of negative ﬂux and is stretched with its tail pointing northwestward.
This indicates a southeastward-directed axial ﬁeld in FC2 and a sinistral chirality, as typical
for the southern-hemisphere ﬁlament channel.

3.2. The Cusp Structure at the Junction of Two Filament Channels

Using the coronal cells visible in AIA 193 ˚A images, we ﬁnd evidences of two ﬁlament
channels within the giant dark channel over the solar disk from April 22 to April 27. One

– 6 –

is a long dextral FC1 in the northern hemisphere. The other is a long sinistral FC2 in the
southern hemisphere which crosses slightly the solar equator into the northern hemisphere.
At the junction of FC1 and FC2, where the southwest end of FC1 and the northwest end
of FC2 are close to each other, a cusp structure is observed. Figure 4 shows this cusp
structure in 193 ˚A images (top panels), whose FOV is outlined by the green square in Figure
1. Superposing the AIA 193 ˚A images with the contours of the HMI LOS magnetograms, we
notice that the southwest end of FC1 (see the dotted curve in panel (a)) and the northwest
end of FC2 (see the dashed curve) are all located on the positive ﬁelds of AR 12532. Around
00:00 UT on April 23, two ﬁlaments were observed clearly within FC1 and FC2 through
the Hα image in panel (d). During the following day, dark material ﬂows from these two
ﬁlaments to the cusp structure were detected (see the black arrows in panel (e)). On April
24, the ﬁlaments in these two channels as seen in the Hα observation disappeared eventually
(panel (f)).

Based on the photospheric vector magnetic ﬁelds at 10:00 UT on April 23, we extrapolate
the 3D magnetic topology of the cusp structure by using NLFFF modeling. Figures 5(a)
and 5(b) show the extrapolation results from the top view and side view, respectively. The
cusp structure is depicted clearly, and consists of two sets of ﬁeld lines, which belong to two
diﬀerent ﬁlament channels (FC1 and FC2). It is shown that the cusp structure is rooted on
the positive-polarity ﬁelds of AR 12532. And the footpoints of the ﬁeld lines belonging to
FC1 (see the purple loop bundles) are on the south of that of the ﬁeld lines belonging to
FC2 (see the green loop bundles).

To investigate the material ﬂows from the ﬁlament in FC1 to the cusp structure, we
extend the region outlined by the green square in Figure 4(d) and show the evolution of this
region in Figure 6 (also see the movie 1.mov attached to Figure 6). The ﬁlament in FC1 is
distinct in 193 ˚A images, with a barb extending southeastward in the middle. From about
21:00 UT on April 22, the brightening appeared intermittently and repeatedly near the foot
of the barb (see the white arrow in panel (b)), where the consistent ﬂux cancellation was de-
tected as well (see the blue circles in panels (d)-(f)). Meanwhile, the material of this ﬁlament
moved successively toward the cusp structure along the axis of FC1 (see the green arrows in
panels (b) and (c)). The green domain “A-B” in panel (a) approximates the projected tra-
jectory of the material ﬂow in the plan of sky. We make a time-space plot along this domain
and display it in panel (g). It is shown that the ﬁlament material successively moved away
from the ﬁlament, forming repeated ﬂows following separate trajectories. Then we delineate
two trajectories with green dotted curves and estimated their projected velocities. In these
two trajectories, the ﬂowing ﬁlament material accelerated from ∼ 5.6 km s−1 to ∼ 35.5 km
s−1 and from ∼ 5.2 km s−1 to ∼ 22.1 km s−1, respectively.

– 7 –

In FC2, dark ﬁlament material ﬂows toward the cusp structure was also detected (see
the animation 2.mov attached to Figure 7). Figure 7 displays the region outlined by the red
square in Figure 4(d). The north part of FC2 and the dark ﬂows (see green curved arrows
in Figure 7(a2) and 7(b2)) were observed clearly in 193 ˚A channel from April 22 to 23. In
addition, bright loops frequently appeared within FC2 and are denoted by the arrows with
diﬀerent colors.

The results of NLFFF extrapolation reveal that the cusp structure was rooted on the
positive-polarity ﬁelds of AR 12532. To study the evolution of the magnetic ﬁelds around
the footpoints of the cusp structure, we check HMI LOS magnetograms from April 21 to
24 and show the results in Figure 8. Using the extrapolation as shown in Figure 5, we
approximate the location where the cusp structure was rooted and mark this region by red
dashed rectangles in Figures 8(a) and 8(d). On April 21, a negative-polarity magnetic patch
(see the blue circles in panels (a)-(c)) approached the positive ﬁelds where the cusp structure
was rooted, and magnetic ﬂux cancellation kept occurring between them. On the other side
of the cusp footpoints region, negative magnetic ﬂux repeatedly emerged and canceled with
the surrounding ﬁelds with opposite polarity during April 23 (see the green rectangles in
panels (d)-(f)).

3.3. The Giant Dark Channel After a Solar Rotation

The giant dark channel occupied the solar disk from 2016 April 22 to April 27 until it
rotated to the farside of the Sun on April 28. After a solar rotation, this channel appeared
again in the solar disk on 2016 May 21, and the shape of the channel was a fallen “U” with
a break in the position where the cusp was previously located but had disappeared that
time (see Figure 9). Figure 9(a) displays the solar disk in composite image of 171 ˚A, 193 ˚A,
and 211 ˚A. Two separate ﬁlament channels are distinguished unambiguously with one in the
northern hemisphere and the other in the southern hemisphere (see the black dashed curves).
Combining the HMI LOS magnetogram (see panel (b)), we notice that the ﬁlament channels
was located above the PIL with a global scale. Around the bottom of this fallen “U”, a
strong active region NOAA 12546 completely emerged in the eastern side of the ﬁlament
channel in the southern hemisphere. Near the bend, the western side of the giant channel
was dominated by the positive ﬁelds, and the eastern side was dominantly negative, which
was close to the positive polarity side of AR 12546.

To investigate the chiralities of the ﬁlament channels in diﬀerent hemispheres, we choose
two areas around these two ﬁlament channels (see the squares in Figure 9(a)) and show
them in Figure 10. Since the Hα observations exhibit clearly the ﬁlament barbs in these two

– 8 –

regions, we identify the chiralities of these ﬁlament channels according to the right-bearing
or left-bearing ﬁlament barbs in the channels (Martin et al. 2008). Figures 10(a) and 10(b)
exhibit the ﬁlament channel region in the northern hemisphere on May 21. In 171 ˚A image
of panel (a), we contour the negative and positive magnetic ﬁelds with blue and red curves
while the green curves are the contour of the ﬁlament fragments as seen in the Hα observation
(see panel (b)). The ﬁlament here was located in the west-east area above the PIL. In panel
(b), the dextral ﬁlament barbs in this region are denoted by the white arrows in Hα image.
Another ﬁlament channel region in the southern hemisphere is shown in Figures 10(c) and
10(d). Panel (d) reveals that the ﬁlament barbs in this channel region are sinistral. Thus
the two ﬁlament channels exhibit the same chiralities as in the previous rotation.

4. Summary and Discussion

Employing the successive observations from the SDO and GONG, we investigate a
giant dark channel occupying the solar disk from 2016 April 22 to April 27. Within this
dark channel, we detect two ﬁlament channels. One is a long dextral ﬁlament channel (FC1)
in the northern hemisphere, and the other one is a long sinistral ﬁlament channel (FC2) in
the southern hemisphere which overlaps slightly into the northern hemisphere. These two
ﬁlament channels with diﬀerent chiralities come together near the solar equator, forming a
cusp structure associated with AR 12532. The extrapolated 3D magnetic ﬁelds conﬁrm the
existence of this cusp structure and reveal that it was rooted on the positive-polarity ﬁelds
of AR 12532. Moreover, dark material ﬂows from the ﬁlaments within these two ﬁlament
channels to this cusp were detected. Intermittent magnetic ﬂux emergence and cancellation
were also observed around the footpoints of the cusp structure. On 2016 May 21, after a
solar rotation, the cusp structure had disappeared, and the giant dark channel broke in the
middle where another AR, NOAA 12546, had emerged completely. The chiralities of the two
ﬁlament channels within this dark channel remained as dextral in the northern hemisphere
and sinistral in the southern hemisphere, as in the previous solar rotation.

From 2016 April 22 to April 27, the giant dark channel extended from the northern
hemisphere to the southern one, occupying the solar disk. Existence of such a large-scale
region in the solar disk suggests the global order of the solar magnetic ﬁeld. This elongated
series of dark regions lie on the PIL with global scale, within which two ﬁlament channels
exist: dextral FC1 in the northern hemisphere and sinistral FC2 in the southern hemisphere.
The northwestern side of FC1 was dominantly positive magnetic ﬂux and the southeastern
side negative magnetic ﬂux. Meanwhile, the dominant ﬂux in the southwestern side of FC2
was positive and the northeastern side negative. From 2016 April 22 to April 27, AR 12532

– 9 –

was located on the western side of FC1 near its southwest end, where the channel was
reinforced by the positive ﬂux elements of this AR. A similar phenomenon was reported
by Anderson & Martin (2005) as well. They suggested that the ﬂux of new active regions
supplements the dominant polarity of the channel on each side, sustaining the channel for a
long time. In present work, the giant dark channel existed for a long time and appeared again
in 2016 May. After a solar rotation, the giant channel broke in the middle, where another
active region NOAA 12546 emerged completely on the east side of FC2 near its northwest
end. The positive ﬂux of this AR canceled the ﬂux sustaining the channel. According to
the Hale’s law of AR magnetic orientation, for the 24 solar cycle, the following polarity of
an AR in the northern hemisphere would be positive and the leading polarity of an AR in
the southern hemisphere would be positive. As a result, unless an AR exactly forms on
the axis of FC1 in the northern hemisphere, the AR positive polarity will be closer to FC1
on its western side and the AR negative polarity will be closer on the eastern side, which
would statistically sustain FC1. However, for the FC2 in the southern hemisphere, the
surrounding ARs would statistically cancel the ﬂux sustaining the channel. We propose that
the continuous sustainment of ﬂux elements from the nearby ARs in the northern hemisphere
(such as AR 12532) may support the continued existence of FC1 from 2016 April to 2016
May. However, if some ARs emerge beside this channel in the southern hemisphere (such as
AR 12546), the ﬂux from these neighboring ARs would cancel the ﬂux sustaining FC2, the
northern part of which had been destroyed by May 21. This process may eventually lead to
the disappearance of FC2.

Previous studies reveal a statistical preference for dextral chirality in the northern hemi-
sphere and sinistral chirality in the southern hemisphere (Rust 1967; Martin et al. 1994;
Bernasconi et al. 2005). This hemispheric pattern is unusual, as it is exactly opposite to the
result of diﬀerential rotation acting on a north-south coronal arcade overlying an east-west
PIL (Mackay & van Ballegooijen 2005). To explain this phenomenon, two groups of theories
were developed, i.e., the surface eﬀects (Kuperus 1996; Zirker et al. 1997; Martens & Zwaan
2001) and the subsurface eﬀects (Rust & Kumar 1994; Priest et al. 1996). Zirker et al.
(1997) proposed that the combination of supergranular motions, diﬀerential rotation, and
magnetic reconnection may lead to the hemispheric pattern. Lim & Chae (2009) suggested
that the chirality of intermediate ﬁlaments may result from the magnetic helicity of their
associated active regions. In present work, the chirality distribution of the ﬁlament channels
was consistent with the hemispheric pattern during the solar rotation from 2016 April to
May. Our observations of the giant dark channel and the chiralities of the two ﬁlament
channels within this giant channel suggest the existence of global order of the solar magnetic
ﬁeld.

At the junction of the two ﬁlament channels (FC1 and FC2) with diﬀerent chiralities,

– 10 –

we observe a cusp structure. Cusp structures between close ends of two ﬁlaments or ﬁlament
In the
channels have rarely been reported (Martin et al. 1994; Schmieder et al. 2004).
present work, for the ﬁrst time, we investigate the magnetic topology, associated dynamic
activities, and the evolution of underlying magnetic ﬁelds of the cusp structure. The NLFFF
extrapolation reveals that the cusp structure reported in our work consists of two sets of ﬁeld
lines and is rooted in the positive-polarity ﬁelds of AR 12532. These two sets of ﬁeld lines
respectively belong to FC1 and FC2. In addition, the footpoints of the ﬁeld lines belonging
to northern FC1 are on the south of that of the ﬁeld lines belonging to southern FC2 (see
Figure 5). The reverse locations of the footpoints of the two sets of ﬁeld lines imply that
rotational motion of the AR magnetic patch where the footpoints are rooted could have
contributed to the formation of this cusp structure (Kumar et al. 2010).

Dynamics of the solar ﬁlaments have been studied for several decades (Schmieder et al.
1985, 2017). Here we also detect dark material ﬂows from the ﬁlaments in FC1 and FC2
to the cusp. In FC1, the intermittent brightening in 193 ˚A wavelength and magnetic ﬂux
cancellation occurred near the foot of one ﬁlament barb (see Figure 6). This implies that
the ﬂux cancellation destabilized the ﬁlament in FC1 and disturbed the ﬁlament material
(Deng et al. 2002; Li et al. 2015; Schmieder et al. 2006), which then moved successively
toward the cusp structure along the axis of FC1. Similarly, the dark ﬂows were observed in
FC2 as well as bright loops.

The successive SDO observations show that the cusp structure disappeared on 2016 May
21 after a solar rotation. Checking the evolution of the magnetic ﬁelds around the footpoints
of the cusp structure from from April 21 to 24, we notice that magnetic ﬂux emergence and
cancellation kept occurring around the cusp footpoints region. Moreover, when the cusp
structure disappeared after a solar rotation, AR 12546 had emerged completely around
the north part of FC2, where the giant dark channel broke. Therefore, we suggest that
the intermittent magnetic ﬂux emergence and cancellation in the cusp region destroyed the
magnetic structure of the cusp structure and eventually resulted in the disappearance of the
cusp structure and the break of the giant dark channel.

Fig. 2.— AIA 193 ˚A image and HMI LOS magnetogram showing the ﬁlament channel in the
northern hemisphere within the giant dark channel on 2016 April 23. On the southeast side
of this channel, coronal cells are distorted into tadpole shapes with their tails pointing to the
southwest along the channel. The blue circle marks the head of one of these coronal cells,
which is rooted in the majority polarity. And the blue arrow points out the tail direction of
this cell. This corresponds to a northeastward-directed ﬁeld along the ﬁlament channel and
a dextral chirality.

Fig. 3.— Similar to Figure 2, but for the ﬁlament channel in southern hemisphere within
the giant dark channel. Coronal cells on the northeast side of the ﬁlament channel are
still distorted into tadpoles with their heads rooted in the majority polarity and their tails
oriented in northwest along the channel. One of these cells is marked by the blue circle and
arrow. This corresponds to a southeastward-directed ﬁeld along the ﬁlament channel and a
sinistral chirality.

Panels (a)-(c): a series of 193 ˚A images displaying the material ﬂows. The green domain
“A-B” in panel (a) is along the projected trajectory of the ﬂows, and the green arrows
in panels (b) and (c) point out its direction. The emission strengthening around the foot
of the ﬁlament barb is marked by the white arrow in panel (b). Panels (d)-(f): sequence
of HMI LOS magnetograms showing the evolution of the underlying magnetic ﬁelds. The
blue circles label the position corresponding to the brightening in 193 ˚A images, where
magnetic ﬂux cancellation is detected. Panel (g): time-space plot along domain “A-B” in
193 ˚A channel. The green dotted lines approximate the projected trajectories of the ﬂowing
ﬁlament material. (An animation (1.mov) of the 193 ˚A images and HMI LOS magnetograms
shown in this ﬁgure is available in the online edition.)

Fig. 10.— Two ﬁlament channels in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively.
Panels (a)-(b): AIA 171 ˚A image and Hα image from the Udaipur Solar Observatory showing
the ﬁlament channel in the northern hemisphere. In panel (a), the blue and red curves show
the negative and positive magnetic ﬁelds beside the channel, respectively. And the green
curves outline the ﬁlament fragments inside the channel. The dextral barbs of the ﬁlament
are marked in panel (b). Panels (c)-(d): AIA 171 ˚A image and Hα image from the Learmonth
Solar Observatory displaying the ﬁlament channel in the southern hemisphere. The features
marked here are similar to those in panels (a)-(b). However, the chirality of the ﬁlament in
this ﬁlament channel is sinistral.
