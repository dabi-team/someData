Abstract

This article presents a computational study of saturated ﬂow boiling in non-circular microchannels. The unit
channel of a multi-microchannel evaporator, consisting of the ﬂuidic channel and surrounding evaporator walls, is
emulated and the conjugate heat transfer problem is solved. Simulations are performed using OpenFOAM v2106
and the built-in geometric Volume Of Fluid method, augmented with self-developed libraries to include liquid-vapour
phase-change and improve the surface tension force calculation. A systematic study is conducted by employing water
at atmospheric pressure, a channel hydraulic diameter of Dh = 229 µm, a uniform base heat ﬂux of qb = 100 kW/m2,
and by varying the channel width-to-height aspect-ratio and channel ﬁn thickness in the range ǫ = 0.25 − 4 and
W f = Dh/8 − Dh, respectively. The eﬀects of conjugate heat transfer and channel aspect-ratio on the bubble and
evaporative ﬁlm dynamics, heat transfer, and evaporator temperature are investigated in detail. This study reveals that,
when the ﬂow is single-phase, higher Nusselt numbers and lower evaporator temperatures are achieved for ǫ < 1. In
the two-phase ﬂow regime, the trends of the Nusselt number versus the aspect-ratio are mixed, although for smaller
channel ﬁns an ascending trend of Nu for increasing aspect-ratios is apparent. Nonetheless, due to conjugate heat
transfer, Nusselt numbers and evaporator base temperatures follow diﬀerent trends when varying the aspect-ratio,
and channels with ǫ < 1 seem to promote lower evaporator temperatures than higher aspect-ratio conduits, despite
exhibiting slightly worse two-phase convective heat transfer performances.

1. Introduction

Flow boiling in mini- and microchannels is recognised as one of the most eﬃcient cooling solutions for high-
power-density applications. Recent advances in manufacturing technology have enabled devices such as high-performance
computers, power electronics, lasers, avionics, electric vehicles, batteries, photovoltaics, miniature fuel cells, energy
conversion and storage systems, evaporators, condensers and reactors, amongst other, to operate at high power densi-
ties [1]. These applications involve heat ﬂuxes of O(MW/m2), while the heat removal capability of traditional single-
phase cooling is below 1 MW/m2 [2], which has resulted in a dramatic and urgent demand for high-performance
thermal management systems that can transfer unprecedentedly high heat ﬂuxes. Boiling two-phase ﬂows in mi-
crochannels [3]: (i) yield very high heat transfer coeﬃcients and maintain uniform surface temperatures, vital for
the correct operation of components; (ii) respond passively to alleviate localised ‘hot-spots’, as the heat transfer co-
eﬃcient increases with the heat ﬂux without the need for actively-controlled (higher) ﬂow rates; (iii) oﬀer a large
surface-to-volume ratio, beneﬁtting the compactness of the system. As such, ﬂow boiling in microchannels has been
studied extensively in recent years, with a focus on ﬂow pattern transitions, void fraction, pressure drop, heat transfer
coeﬃcient, and critical heat ﬂux [1, 4].

In order to increase the surface area, the two-phase ﬂow is usually organised into microevaporators, where multiple
parallel microchannels are manufactured into a thin metal die made of conductive material, which is placed in direct

contact with the surface to be refrigerated [5]. Heat is delivered to the ﬂuid via heat conduction through the solid walls
of the evaporator and heat convection at the contact surface between ﬂuid and solid, thus forming a conjugate heat
transfer problem. Since heat is applied to one side of the evaporator, the channels are subject to a nonuniform heating
condition, as heat is unequally distributed among the channel walls. The heat removal capability of a microevaporator
is characterised by the convective heat transfer achieved by the two-phase ﬂow, quantiﬁed by a boiling heat transfer
coeﬃcient or Nusselt number, and by the value of the evaporator base temperature, since the heat sink must limit the
temperature of the device to be refrigerated below a threshold value.

Within microchannels, after nucleation vapour bubbles grow quickly and occupy the cross-section leading to
slug or annular ﬂow patterns, with bubbly ﬂows being suppressed already at very low values of vapour quality [6].
Surface tension forces rearrange the liquid-vapour interface pattern into thick liquid lobes at channel corners and
thin liquid ﬁlms at the centre [7], and the thickness and morphology of this ﬁlm strongly depends on the channel
aspect-ratio [8, 9]. The distribution of this liquid ﬁlm has a direct impact on the heat transfer coeﬃcient, as both
experimental [10, 11] and numerical [12, 13] studies have demonstrated that the local heat transfer coeﬃcient h is
inversely proportional to the ﬁlm thickness δ, h ≈ λl/δ, with λl being the liquid thermal conductivity, with ﬁlm
dryout being highly detrimental to heat transfer performance. As such, the channel aspect-ratio is expected to yield
signiﬁcant impact on microchannel boiling heat transfer. The experimental literature on the impact of the channel
shape on boiling heat transfer is rather vast, and comprehensive reviews have been carried out by Magnini and Matar
[13], Vontas et al. [14] and Al-Zaidi et al. [5]. It emerges that there is still substantial disagreement on the eﬀect of
the channel aspect-ratio on boiling heat transfer, with contrasting trends of heat transfer coeﬃcient and microchannel
wall temperature versus aspect-ratio being reported in these studies.

More recently, interface-resolving numerical methods have been employed to investigate relevant ﬂuid mechanics
structures and heat transfer mechanisms pertinent to ﬂow boiling in noncircular microchannels. Magnini and Matar
[13] performed a systematic analysis of the impact of the channel aspect-ratio on the bubble dynamics and heat
transfer and concluded that square channels performed better at lower ﬂow rates while rectangular channels exhibited
larger Nusselt numbers at higher ﬂow rates. However, their study did not include conjugate heat transfer through the
evaporator walls, and it considered an idealised slug ﬂow at low heat ﬂux conditions (q ∼ 10 kW/m2), where liquid
ﬁlm dryout never occurred. Vontas et al. [14] simulated ﬂow boiling in single and multiple rectangular channels for
diﬀerent channel hydraulic diameters also accounting for the evaporator walls. They reported an ascending trend
of the heat transfer coeﬃcient when reducing the channel size, but did not study the impact of the channel aspect-
ratio, which was maintained constant. Lin et al. [15] modeled ﬂow boiling in a single rectangular microchannel
accounting for one evaporator wall. They varied the material and thickness of the wall and observed that two-phase
heat transfer was enhanced by thicker walls, which exhibited higher temperature and increased the bubble growth rate,
and by highly-conductive materials. However, their study considered only one microchannel wall and thus it is not
representative of an actual heat sink.

The literature review outlined above emphasises the fact that the impact of the channel aspect-ratio and conjugate
heat transfer on ﬂow boiling in microchannel evaporators is still unclear. Conjugate heat transfer is particularly
important in microgeometries, where solid walls are of thickness comparable to the channel size, such that heat
diﬀuses along all coordinate directions [16] and the ﬂuid is nonuniformly heated around the channel perimeter. This
article presents a computational study of the eﬀect of the geometrical features of channel and evaporator walls on heat
transfer in both single-phase and two-phase ﬂow. The unit channel of a multi-microchannel evaporator, consisting of
channel and surrounding walls, is modelled and a conjugate heat transfer problem is solved. Simulations are performed
with OpenFOAM v2106, using the built-in geometric Volume Of Fluid (VOF) solver isoAdvector [17], augmented
with self-developed functions implementing thermally-driven liquid-vapour phase-change and improving the native
surface tension method. Simulations are run for a constant value of the channel hydraulic diameter, Dh = 229 µm,
mass ﬂux (G = 140 kg/(m2s)) and base heat ﬂux (qb = 100 kW/m2), using water at atmospheric pressure and copper
as working ﬂuid and evaporator material, respectively. A constant heat ﬂux is provided to the outer wall of the
evaporator base, and the resulting single- and two-phase dynamics and heat transfer are investigated for a range of
aspect-ratios ǫ = 0.25 − 4 and of channel ﬁn widths W f = Dh/8 − Dh.

The rest of this article is organised as follows: the numerical framework is described in Sec. 2 and results of vali-
dation benchmarks are illustrated in Sec. 3; the results of the single-phase and ﬂow boiling simulations are presented
in Sec. 4; Sec. 5 provides a discussion of the observed heat transfer trends, and conclusions are summarised in Sec. 6.

2. Numerical framework

2.1. Governing equations

The numerical model is based on the solution of a conjugate heat transfer problem in the ﬂuid and solid regions
of the domain. The ﬂuid model solves the Navier-Stokes and energy equations for the ﬂow of two immiscible phases,
namely liquid and vapour, separated by an interface. The liquid and vapour phases are both treated as incompressible,
Newtonian ﬂuids. A single-ﬂuid formulation is adopted and the two phases are treated as a single mixture ﬂuid with
variable properties across the interface, such that a single ﬁeld of velocity, pressure, and temperature are suﬃcient
to describe the ﬂow, and a single set of conservation equations holds throughout the domain [18]. Accordingly, the
governing equations of mass, momentum, and energy, for a ﬂow with phase-change, are expressed as follows:

∇ · u =

˙ρ
ρ

∂(ρu)
∂t

+ ∇ · (ρuu) = −∇p + ∇ · µ
(cid:20)

(∇u) + (∇u)T

+ Fσ

(cid:21)

∂(ρcpT )
∂t

+ ∇ · (ρcpuT ) = ∇ · (λ∇T ) + ˙h

(1)

(2)

(3)

where u indicates the ﬂuid velocity, ˙ρ the mass ﬂux due to phase-change, ρ the mixture ﬂuid density, t the time, p
the pressure, µ the dynamic viscosity, Fσ the surface tension force vector, T the temperature, cp the constant pressure
speciﬁc heat, λ the thermal conductivity, and ˙h is the enthalpy source due to phase-change. Details of surface tension
and phase-change models are provided in the subsections below. Gravitational eﬀects are neglected in this work.

By means of the VOF method, a volume fraction ﬁeld α is deﬁned to map liquid and vapour phases throughout the
ﬂow domain. In each computational cell of the domain, α identiﬁes the fraction of the cell occupied by the primary
phase, which corresponds to liquid in the present case. Therefore, the volume fraction takes values of 1 in the liquid,
0 in the vapour, and 0 < α < 1 in cells that are cut by the interface. The volume fraction ﬁeld is evolved upon solution
of the following transport equation:

∂α
∂t

˙ρ
ρ

+ ∇ · (αu) =

α

(4)

Using the volume fraction ﬁeld, the properties of the mixture ﬂuid can be computed as an average over the two phases,
e.g. ρ = αρl + (1 − α)ρv, with the subscripts v and l denoting vapour- and liquid-speciﬁc properties, respectively. All
the ﬂuid-speciﬁc properties (e.g. ρv, ρl, µv, µl, etc.) are considered constant in this work.

A separate mesh is used to discretise the solid domain. The temperature ﬁeld T s in the solid domain is obtained

by solving the following heat conduction equation:

∂(ρscp,sT s)
∂t

= ∇ · (λs∇T s)

(5)

where the subscript s refers to solid. At the boundary between solid and ﬂuid regions, the ﬂuid and solid temperature
ﬁelds are coupled by imposing continuity of temperature and heat ﬂux, which is achieved by solving the ﬂuid and
solid energy equations iteratively, and adjusting the boundary conditions after every iteration.

2.2. Surface tension model

The surface tension force, Fσ in Eq. (2), is formulated according to the Continuum Surface Force method [19]

and computed as:

Fσ =

2ρ
ρl + ρv
where σ is the surface tension coeﬃcient (considered constant) and κ the local interface curvature; the term 2ρ/(ρl+ρv)
represents a density-correction factor that does not change the integral of the surface tension across the interface, but
redistributes the surface tension towards the denser ﬂuid to prevent unphysical accelerations in the region occupied
by the lighter ﬂuid [19]; the impact of the density-correction term on the simulation of ﬂow boiling in microchannels
will be investigated in Sec. 3.2. The interface curvature is estimated by means of derivatives of a smoothed volume

σκ|∇α|

(6)

3

fraction ﬁeld ˜α, κ = ∇ · (∇ ˜α/|∇ ˜α|) [20], where the smoothed volume fraction ﬁeld is obtained by interpolating α from
the computational cell centres to face centres and by averaging the resulting α f ﬁeld back to cell centres according to:

˜α =

f α f S f
f S f

P

(7)

P
where the sum spans the f faces (each of area S f ) of the control volume. The use of a smoothed volume fraction
ﬁeld to calculate κ was already included in the original work of Brackbill et al. [19] and has the eﬀect of improving
the accuracy of the calculation of κ, compared to using the unsmoothed ﬁeld α, thus reducing the magnitude of the
spurious velocity caused by errors in the surface tension calculation. The smoothing cycle can be repeated multiple
times to further smoothen α before calculating κ, though its beneﬁcial eﬀect on mitigating the spurious velocity
saturates after a few cycles [20]; the optimal number of smoothing cycles will be object of the analysis in Sec. 3.2.

A static contact angle is imposed at the wall boundaries where the liquid-vapour interface comes in contact with
solid walls. The contact angle is set by adjusting the direction of the unit normal to the interface in boundary cells that
are cut by the contact line, using OpenFOAM’s built-in implementation.

2.3. Phase-change model

The mass and enthalpy source terms due to evaporation, ˙ρ in Eqs. (1) and (4) and ˙h in Eq. (3), are modelled
according to the work of Hardt and Wondra [21]. The evaporating mass ﬂux at the liquid-vapour interface, here
denoted as ˙m, is calculated as a function of the local interface superheat according to the Hertz-Knudsen-Schrage
relationship [22], and adopting the linearisation proposed by Tanasawa [23] for low values of the superheat:

˙m =

2γ
2 − γ (cid:18)

M
2πRg (cid:19)

1/2 ρvhlv(Tlv − T sat)
T 3/2
sat

(8)

where γ is the evaporation coeﬃcient, hlv is the vaporisation latent heat, M is the molecular weight of the ﬂuid, Rg
the universal gas constant, Tlv is the temperature at the liquid-vapour interface, and T sat the saturation temperature of
the ﬂuid. In this work, the evaporation coeﬃcient is set to 1 according to preliminary test benchmarks [24, 12]. An
initial volumetric mass source ˙ρ0 is estimated by accounting for the evaporating mass ﬂux calculated based on the
temperature on the liquid side of the interface:

˙ρ0 = Nα|∇α| ˙m

(9)

where α is the liquid volume fraction and N is a normalisation factor to ensure that the global evaporation rate is
preserved [21]. A smoothed evaporation mass source ˙ρ1 is then obtained by solving a steady diﬀusion equation as
described in detail in [21, 12]; the smoothing of the evaporation source term occurs over a few cells across the interface
and improves the numerical stability of the solver. The ﬁnal volumetric source ˙ρ is obtained by redistributing ˙ρ1 across
the interface on the vapor and liquid side according to:

Nv(1 − α) ˙ρ1,
−Nlα ˙ρ1,
0,

if α < αcut
if α > 1 − αcut
if αcut < α < 1 − αcut

(10)

˙ρ = 



where Nl, Nv are normalisation factors ensuring that the masses of liquid evaporated and vapour created are conserved
by the redistribution step. The threshold parameter αcut, here αcut = 10−3, guarantees that the evaporation source term
is nonzero only on vapour- or liquid-full cells. The enthalpy source ˙h accounts for the latent heat dissipated by the
evaporation process and is calculated from the initial volumetric source term as ˙h = − ˙ρ0hlv.

2.4. Discretisation methods

The governing equations are solved using a customised implementation in OpenFOAM, version v2106. The
transport equations are discretised with a ﬁnite-volume method on a collocated grid arrangement. OpenFOAM v2106
provides both an algebraic (interFOAM; see [25, 26]) and a geometric (isoAdvector; see [17, 27]) VOF solver. The

4

numerical framework outlined in the previous subsections has been implemented in both versions of VOF, which in
our custom solver are merged into a single solver, where the interface advection method is speciﬁed by the user as
a new solver option in fvSolution. This way, the user can select whether to run the solver using the algebraic VOF
(interFOAM mode), or using the geometric VOF (isoAdvector mode) with any of the built-in interface reconstruction
methods (isoAlpha, isoRDF, plicRDF; see [27]). When running the solver in interFOAM mode, the volume frac-
tion Eq. (4) is discretised with a ﬁrst-order time-explicit scheme based on the MULES (Multidimensional Universal
Limiter for Explicit Solution) algorithm [25, 26], set with nAlphaCorr 1, nAlphaSubCycles 3 and cAlpha 1. When
running the solver in isoAdvector mode, the advection method isoAlpha is selected, with nAlphaSubCycles 3. All
other equations are integrated in time with a ﬁrst-order implicit method. The divergence operators are discretised us-
ing second-order TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) schemes [28], whereas Laplacian operators are discretised with
central ﬁnite-diﬀerences. The PISO (Pressure Implicit Splitting of Operators) algorithm [29] is utilised to iteratively
update pressures and velocities (momentumPredictor yes; nCorrectors 3) within each time-step. The residuals thresh-
olds for the iterative solution of the ﬂow equations are set to 10−7 for the velocity, 10−9 for the pressure, 10−8 for the
volume fraction, and 10−10 for the temperature and the evaporation source term smoothing equation. The time-step
of the simulation is variable and is calculated based on a maximum allowed Courant number of 0.1, unless otherwise
speciﬁed.

3. Validation

3.1. Vapour bubble growth in superheated liquid

To assess the implementation of the evaporation model in both the algebraic and geometric VOF methods, the
ﬁrst test case selected is the growth of a spherical vapour bubble in an inﬁnitely extended superheated liquid domain.
When a vapour bubble nucleates in a pool of superheated liquid (Tl = T∞) far from solid walls, there exists an initial
growth stage where Tv = T∞ and pv = psat(T∞), the bubble growth is limited only by the inertia of the surrounding
liquid being displaced and the bubble radius follows a linear trend with time. As the bubble grows, the vapour pressure
and temperature decrease until pv ≈ p∞ and Tv ≈ T sat(p∞). This identiﬁes a second growth stage where the bubble
growth rate is limited only by the rate at which latent heat is supplied at the interface, and the bubble radius obeys a
∼ t1/2 law [22].

The latter heat-transfer-controlled growth stage is reproduced here as a validation benchmark for the solver. A
spherical steam bubble of initial radius Rb,0 = 50 µm and temperature Tv = 373.15 K is placed in a pool of superheated
water at the system pressure p∞ = 1 atm and temperature T∞ = 374.15 K. The ﬂuid domain is a two-dimensional
axisymmetric square box of side of 1 mm; using symmetry boundary conditions, only one quarter of the domain is
simulated. A thin thermal boundary layer surrounds the bubble during its growth and the exact temperature proﬁle
within the liquid must be set at t = 0 for a coherent initial growth. Scriven [30] has derived an analytical solution
for the heat-transfer-controlled growth stage of the bubble, providing expressions for the liquid temperature over time
and distance from the interface, and a law for the bubble radius over time Rb(t) = 2β(at)1/2, with β being a constant
obtained from the solution [30], and a = λl/(ρlcp,l) being the liquid thermal diﬀusivity. For the conditions presently
simulated, the initial boundary layer thickness (when, at t = 0, Rb,0 = 50 µm) is about 16 µm and the temperature
proﬁle resulting from the analytical solution is set as an initial condition for the liquid temperature in the simulation.
The initial volume fraction ﬁeld is set via OpenFOAM’s utility setAlphaField, which enables accurate initialisation of
volume fractions by calculating the intersections between implicit functions deﬁning the bubble shape and the domain
mesh. The simulations are run till t = 0.0047 s, where the bubble is about 4 times its initial size. The maximum
Courant number allowed for the simulation is set to 0.02.

The numerical solver is run both in algebraic and geometric VOF modes to compare the two diﬀerent interface
advection methods. Surface tension is disabled by setting σ = 0, thus enabling us to test speciﬁcally the performances
of the phase-change model and interface advection methods, without the inﬂuence of the surface tension algorithm.
Four diﬀerent meshes are utilised, all structured with orthogonal and uniform hexahedrons, with grid spacings of
∆ = 2.5 µm (Rb,0/∆ = 20), ∆ = 1.25 µm (40), ∆ = 0.625 µm (80), and ∆ = 0.3125 µm (160). A snapshot of the
bubble growth dynamics is shown in Fig. 1(a), where the velocity and temperature ﬁelds surrounding the bubble
at the last time instant of the simulation are depicted. It can be seen that the bubble preserves the spherical shape
during its growth, a thin temperature boundary layer surrounds the bubble and the liquid velocity is directed radially

outward, with a maximum magnitude identiﬁed in the proximity of the liquid-vapour interface. The comparison of the
bubble growth rate versus time for the diﬀerent solver conﬁgurations tested and the analytical solution are presented
in Fig. 1(b). At low mesh resolutions, all advection methods yield a faster growth rate during the initial growth stage.
This can be ascribed to the insuﬃcient resolution of the initial thermal boundary layer surrounding the bubble. At
t = 0, the evaporation rate is calculated based on the temperatures at the centroids of the ﬁrst few liquid cells nearby
the interface, and therefore when the mesh is coarser these centroids are farther from the interface and experience
excessively high temperatures, resulting in higher evaporation rates. At low mesh resolutions, the combination of
phase-change model and algebraic VOF method seems to perform better than the geometric VOF in terms of R(t),
however the slopes of the R(t) curve exhibited by the MULES method at later growth stages are more far oﬀ the exact
solution than the isoAdvector ones. The deviations with the exact solution become of comparable magnitude between
the two methods when Rb,0/∆ = 80 and isoAdvector (interFOAM) overpredicts (underpredicts) the exact growth rate
by less than 2%, whereas analytical and numerical solutions become almost indistinguishable when Rb,0/∆ = 160.
Therefore, both methods yield solutions that converge to the analytical one as the mesh is reﬁned.

In terms of computational overhead, the simulations performed with the algebraic VOF were slightly faster than
those run with isoAdvector, which can be ascribed to the extra geometric interface reconstruction steps performed by
the latter. The simulations with Rb,0/∆ = 80 (160), featuring 640,000 (2,560,000) mesh cells, required 276 (3,100)
core-hours for the algebraic VOF and 320 (3,950) core-hours for the geometric VOF. These simulations were run
on UK’s Tier-2 supercomputer Sulis, which features Dell PowerEdge R6525 computing nodes each with two AMD
EPYC 7742 (Rome) 2.25 GHz 64-core processors, thus making 128 cores and 512 GB DDR4-3200 RAM per node.

3.2. Flow boiling in a microchannel

The second validation benchmark selected is the numerical simulation of the growth of a vapour bubble at the
wall of a heated microchannel, which emulates the experiments and matching simulation performed by Mukherjee
et al. [31]. Mukherjee et al. [31] performed an experiment in a microchannel of slightly trapezoidal cross-section

6

 
 
and hydraulic diameter Dh = 229 µm, where saturated water at atmospheric pressure was introduced with an average
speed of 0.146 m/s. The microchannel was cut into a brass block and heated from three sides, while a plexiglass
cover allowed visualisation from the fourth side. The temperature of the heated walls was reported as 102.1 ◦C. They
observed bubble nucleation and growth along the microchannel and measured the bubble equivalent diameter versus
time, see data in Fig. 2(b). Additionally, they performed numerical simulations of the ﬂow by using a level-set method,
modelling a perfectly square microchannel cross-section, and initialising a steam bubble of diameter of 50 µm over a
heated wall with a contact angle of 30◦ (hydrophilic walls). Their numerical results are also included in Fig. 2(b).

The experimental setup is here emulated as a square microchannel (Dh = 229 µm) of 5Dh length, with the solid
region being disregarded. The channel is heated with a constant temperature of 102.1 ◦C imposed on three sides
while the fourth wall is set as adiabatic. Water at saturation temperature, 100 ◦C, enters the channel with a uniform
velocity of 0.146 m/s. No-slip and a static contact angle of 30◦ are set at all walls. A vapour bubble of diameter
of 50 µm is initialised at the heated wall, opposite the adiabatic one. Gravity is neglected owing to the small spatial
scales. To obtain realistic velocity and temperature ﬁelds to be set as initial conditions at t = 0, a preliminary liquid-
only simulation is run till steady-state is achieved. The computational mesh is a structured orthogonal mesh made of
uniform hexahedrons and grid spacing of 2.29 µm. A similar mesh was used by Mukherjee et al. [31]; tests with a
ﬁner mesh did not show appreciable diﬀerences in the results. The simulation is evolved in time until the bubble nose
approaches the outlet section of the microchannel.

The boiling solver is tested both in algebraic and geometric VOF modes. With both methods, tests are performed
to assess the impact of the surface tension model with and without the density-correction term, and with diﬀerent
numbers of smoothing cycles for the interface curvature calculation (see Section 2.2). Figure 2(a) shows a snapshot
of the ﬂow dynamics little before the bubble reaches the outlet section. A thermal boundary layer develops over the
heated walls as a result of the colder water coming through the inlet section. At the time instant displayed, the bubble
has grown suﬃciently to become elongated and dry patches form over the microchannel walls. The liquid evaporation
rate is maximum at the solid-liquid-vapour contact line, where temperature is the highest. The bubble equivalent
diameter versus time achieved with the diﬀerent simulation setups are displayed in Fig. 2(b). Without neither density-
correction nor smoothing cycles, both isoAdvector and MULES (interFOAM) advection methods yield a signiﬁcant
overestimation of the bubble growth. This can be ascribed to the presence of parasitic currents related to errors in

surface tension, which enhance convective ﬂows near interfaces [21]. isoAdvector seems to particularly suﬀer from
parasitic currents, as it was previously observed in benchmark tests by Gamet et al. [32] and Magnini et al. [9], which
is due to the sharper volume fraction changes at the interface resulting from the geometric VOF advection, which are
detrimental to the interface curvature calculation when this is obtained via gradients of α. The situation improves when
the density-correction term in Eq. (7) is enabled, in particular from the instant when the bubble equivalent diameter
grows above Dh and the bubble becomes elongated. Spurious currents manifest in simulations of elongated bubbles
in microchannels by generating artiﬁcial vortices in the liquid ahead the bubble nose [33], which explains the lower
bubble growth rate trend observed in Fig. 2(b) as density-correction is activated. The activation of smoothing cycles
in the interface curvature calculation does not yield signiﬁcant further changes in the bubble growth rate obtained with
the MULES (though deviations appear at later stages), but it makes a signiﬁcant diﬀerence when using isoAdvector.
Since isoAdvector exhibits a sharper volume fraction ﬁeld across the interface than MULES, a test with 4 smoothing
cycles was also performed, leading to a further reduction of about 5% of the bubble diameter achieved at the end of
the simulation.

Overall, the solver run with density-correction and isoAdvector mode with 4 smoothing cycles, or interFOAM
mode with 2 smoothing cycles, yield results that agree well with the reference data of Mukherjee et al. [31], with
the geometric VOF exhibiting a bubble growth rate closer to Mukherjee et al. [31]’s simulation and the algebraic
VOF following closely the experimental data points. It is worth noting that, though the present simulations were
set similarly to the numerical setup of Mukherjee et al. [31], a few impactful parameters from the experiment are
the initial temperature ﬁeld in the liquid at the instant of bubble nucleation, frequency of bubble
unknown, e.g.
nucleation and/or presence of other bubbles in the microchannel, actual temperature distribution over the boundary
walls; these have a signiﬁcant impact on the bubble growth rate, and thus deviations between experimental data and
simulation results are expected.

4. Results

A systematic analysis of the eﬀect of the channel aspect-ratio and thickness of the ﬁns separating adjacent channels
on the bubble dynamics and heat transfer performance for ﬂow boiling in microchannels was conducted and the results
are presented below, organised in subsections. First, the numerical setup is described in Sec. 4.1; this is followed by
an analysis of the grid sensitivity of the numerical results in Sec. 4.2. Then, the results obtained with liquid-only
single-phase simulations are presented in Sec. 4.3, followed by the ﬁnal Sec. 4.4 where the ﬂow boiling results are
discussed.

4.1. Simulation setup

The geometrical conﬁguration of multi-microchannel evaporators features several parallel microchannels etched
in a block of conductive material, which are thus separated by solid walls (also called ﬁns). The evaporator is typi-
cally heated from below, by placing its base surface in contact with a heater which applies a speciﬁed heat load. In
experimental tests aimed at characterising two-phase heat transfer [34], the top of the evaporator is often covered by
a poorly conductive transparent material (glass, pyrex) to enable ﬂow visualisation while limiting heat losses to the
ambient.

In this numerical work, the geometrical conﬁguration of a multi-microchannel evaporator is emulated by consid-
ering a single channel unit composed of one ﬂuidic channel and the three connected solid wall regions at the two sides
of the channel and below it; a schematic of the ﬂow conﬁguration and notation used in this work is provided in Fig. 3.
Symmetry boundary conditions are applied to the outer surface of the lateral walls to model the presence of adjacent
channels. A constant and uniform heat ﬂux is applied at the evaporator base.

We consider microchannels of square and rectangular cross-sections, of constant hydraulic diameter Dh = 229 µm
and length L = 20Dh. The microchannel has width denoted as Wch and height Hch, with the aspect-ratio deﬁned as
ǫ = Wch/Hch; since the hydraulic diameter is maintained constant, the channel width and height are fully identiﬁed
by Dh and ǫ: Wch = Dh(1 + ǫ)/2, Hch = Dh(1 + ǫ)/(2ǫ). The microchannel base has width Wb and thickness Hb, so
that Wb − Wch = W f identiﬁes the thickness of the ﬁns separating the channels. As boundary conditions, at the ﬂuid
inlet (x = 0, y, z) a liquid-only fully-developed laminar velocity proﬁle of average speed Ul is imposed, together with
T = T sat and a zero-gradient condition for the pressure; the solid boundary at (x = 0, y, z) is set to adiabatic. At the

Figure 3: Schematic of the simulation setup and notation used in this work. The microchannel has width Wch and height Hch, with aspect-ratio
ǫ = Wch/Hch. The microchannel base has width and height Wb and Hb, respectively. The vertical walls (ﬁns) have thickness W f but, as symmetry
boundary conditions are used at the sides of the domain, only half of the wall is modelled. At t = 0, a vapour bubble is initialised at the centre of
the bottom wall, at a distance of 1Dh from the channel inlet; the bubble has initial diameter of 0.2Dh and forms a contact angle of 30◦ with the wall.
Heat is applied to the bottom boundary of the base. The temperature proﬁles in both ﬂuid and solid regions at t = 0 are obtained with a preliminary
liquid-only simulation run till steady-state is achieved. The image above refers to ǫ = 2 and W f = Dh/4.

ﬂuid outlet (x = L, y, z), zero-gradient conditions are set for both velocity and temperature with a uniform pressure
value, and the solid boundary is adiabatic. On the bottom surface of the evaporator base, (x, y = −Hb, z), a uniform
heat ﬂux is applied. The top boundary of the domain (x, y = Hch, z) is adiabatic for both ﬂuid (|z| ≤ Wch/2) and
solid regions (|z| ≥ Wch/2). The three ﬂuid-solid coupled boundaries are identiﬁed as vertical walls (x, y, |z| = Wch/2)
and horizontal walls (x, y = 0, z); here, no-slip condition for the velocity, zero-gradient for the pressure and a static
contact angle of 30◦ for the volume fraction (hydrophilic walls) are imposed, as well as continuity of temperatures
and heat ﬂuxes (see Sec. 2.1). Note that, since all the outer solid boundaries except the base are adiabatic, all the
heat load applied through the base surface is dissipated via heat transfer to the ﬂuid. The Bond number of the ﬂow
is Bo = ρlgD2
h/σ < 0.01, and thus gravitational forces are neglected. To achieve fully-developed velocity and
temperature proﬁles as initial conditions for the two-phase simulation, a preliminary single-phase case with only
liquid is run till steady-state. Figure 3 displays the solid walls of the channel, coloured with the steady temperature
ﬁeld, for a representative case. The results of the single-phase runs will be discussed in detail in Sec. 4.3, as they will
be useful to rationalise the two-phase results. At t = 0, the two-phase simulation starts with steady-state velocity and
temperature ﬁelds, and a small spherical bubble of diameter Deq = 0.2Dh is initialised near the inlet, sitting along the
centreline over the bottom wall, with centroid of coodinates (x = Dh, Deq cos(π/6)/2, 0). Since the ﬂow is expected
to be symmetric to the z = 0 plane, only half of the domain is simulated and symmetry boundary conditions are set at
(x, y, z = 0). The two-phase simulation is run in time till the bubble reaches the outlet section of the channel, which is
on the order of milliseconds.

To perform this study, the channel hydraulic diameter is maintained constant and ﬁve diﬀerent channel aspect-
ratios are tested: ǫ = 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4. For each channel aspect-ratio, four diﬀerent values of the ﬁn thickness are con-
sidered: W f = Dh, Dh/2, Dh/4, Dh/8; these correspond to absolute ﬁn thicknesses ranging from 28.6 µm to 229 µm.
The thickness of the base wall is maintained constant, Hb = 45.8 µm. The working ﬂuid is water at p = 1 atm and
T sat = 373.15 K, with an inlet velocity of Ul = 0.146 m/s (mass ﬂux G = 140 kg/(m2s)); this corresponds to a
value of the capillary number of Ca = µlUl/σ = 0.0007, as such very thin ﬁlms and extended dry vapour patches
are expected to form between the elongated bubble and the channel walls [9]. The Reynolds number of the ﬂow
is Re = ρlUlDh/µl = 100, therefore the ﬂow regime is laminar. A uniform heat ﬂux of qb = 100 kW/m2 is ap-
plied to the outer wall of the microchannel base, corresponding to a base power (for one single channel) ranging

9

 
from Qb = 0.08 W (ǫ = 0.25, W f = Dh/8) to Qb = 0.37 W (ǫ = 4, W f = Dh) and a constant boiling number of
Bl = qb/(ρlUlhlv) = 0.0003. The material composing the solid regions of the evaporator is copper, taken with constant
properties ρs = 8940 kg/m3, cp,s = 385 J/(kg K) and λs = 380 W/(m K).

Following on from the results presented in Sec. 3, for this study the boiling solver is set to run in isoAdvector mode

(geometric VOF), with density-correction enabled and 4 smoothing cycles for the interface curvature calculation.

4.2. Mesh convergence analysis

The computational domain is meshed with structured orthogonal meshes made of cubic hexahdrons. To identify
the optimal mesh arrangement, a grid independence analysis was performed for the case with ǫ = 1 and W f = Dh/8,
with the domain length set to L = 10Dh to decrease the computational cost. Three diﬀerent meshes are tested, with
grid spacing of ∆ = 4.58 µm, 2.29 µm, 1.14 µm, corresponding to 50, 100, 200 mesh elements per hydraulic diameter.
Overall, the three grids (with L = 10Dh) have about 0.4, 3, and 24 million cells.

The grid independence analysis for the single-phase ﬂow is ﬁrst described. The Nusselt number calculated over
the three ﬂuid-solid wall boundaries, at steady-state, is considered. Local values of the Nusselt number are computed
from the simulation data as:

Nuw(x, y, z) =

qw(x, y, z)
[Tw(x, y, z) − T f (x)]

λl

(11)

where qw and Tw are the heat ﬂux and temperature on the horizontal and vertical channel walls in contact with the
solid region; see schematic in Fig. 3. The ﬂuid temperature along the channel is evaluated by integrating an energy
balance from T = T sat at the inlet:

where the symmetry condition at z = 0 has been used to simplify the integral. From Eq. (11), a cross-sectional aver-
age Nusselt number, Nuw(x), is obtained by averaging Nuw(x, y, z) around the cross-sectional perimeter at a speciﬁc
streamwise coordinate x:

The proﬁles of the average Nusselt number along the channel for the three meshes are plotted in Fig. 4(a). The three
curves overlap and diﬀerences are below 1%, thus suggesting that all meshes are suﬃcient to properly resolve the
single-phase ﬂow.

Next, the performances of the grids for the two-phase ﬂow are presented. Owing to the bubble growth and
elongation along the microchannel as time elapses, wall temperatures and heat ﬂuxes vary signiﬁcantly during the
simulation and the Nusselt number is also a function of time, Nuw(x, y, z, t); note that the Nusselt number for the
two-phase ﬂow is still calculated via Eq. (11), but replacing T f (x) with the constant T sat. To compare the grids,
a spatially-averaged Nusselt number is calculated during runtime, by averaging the Nusselt number over the three
ﬂuid-solid walls at each time instant:

where L is the channel length. The average Nusselt number versus time for the two-phase simulations and diﬀerent
meshes is plotted in Fig. 4(b). The time in the abscissa is expressed in terms of the location of the most downstream
end of the bubble, or bubble nose, which is extracted at each time instant and is denoted as xN. The medium and
most reﬁned meshes yield very similar bubble dynamics and the two curves of the Nusselt number versus bubble nose
location overlap throughout the bubble growth and elongation process, whereas the coarsest mesh yields a ∼ 15%
smaller Nusselt number, due to a larger extension of dry vapour patches which can be ascribed to an insuﬃcient

resolution of the liquid ﬁlm trapped between bubble and walls. Therefore, the mesh with 100 cells per hydraulic
diameter was selected to run the analysis presented in the following sections.

Simulations were run on UK’s Tier-1 supercomputer ARCHER2, which features computing nodes with two AMD
EPYC 7742 2.25 GHz 64-core processors, thus making 128 cores and 256 GB of RAM per node. Simulations were run
using two computing nodes and each two-phase run (with L = 20Dh) required between 6,000 and 12,000 core-hours
to complete.

4.3. Single-phase results

In this section, the heat transfer results at steady-state obtained for single-phase simulations run with only liquid,

in the range of aspect-ratios ǫ = 0.25 − 4 and ﬁn thicknesses W f = Dh/8 − Dh, are presented.

4.3.1. Square channel and eﬀect of ﬁn width

Figure 5 illustrates contours of temperature, heat ﬂux, and Nusselt number over the horizontal and vertical channel
walls, and averaged over the cross-stream direction, for a representative case executed with ǫ = 1 and W f = Dh/8.
The heat ﬂux and Nusselt number contours emphasise the development of thermal boundary layers over the coupled
ﬂuid-solid walls, |z|/Wch = 0.5 in Fig. 5(c) and (e) and y/Hch = 0 in Fig. 5(d) and (f), whereas smaller gradients appear
nearby the channel top wall, y/Hch = 1 in Fig. 5(d) and (f), owing to the adiabatic boundary condition. As a result
of the diﬀerent boundary conditions, the temperature distribution over the horizontal wall (Fig. 5(a)) is uniform in the
cross-stream direction whereas temperature decreases towards the top of the channel along the vertical wall (Fig. 5(b)).
Temperature, heat ﬂux and Nusselt number are averaged around the cross-sectional perimeter as indicated in Eq. (13)
and the resulting streamwise proﬁles are shown in Fig. 5(g)-(i), for diﬀerent ﬁn widths. Figure 5(g) includes also the
cross-stream average of the base temperature, Tb(x, z) = T (x, y = −Hb, z), calculated as:

It can be seen that, though ﬂuid enters the channel at T sat, the average temperature of the microchannel wall at the
inlet (x/Dh = 0) is a few degrees higher than T sat, due to the eﬀect of axial heat conduction which redistributes heat

towards the inlet region where the ﬂuid is colder, and thus the temperature rise in the streamwise direction is milder
than expected in the case of negligible conjugate heat transfer eﬀects. Since the channel width Wch is maintained
constant, thicker microchannel walls (W f ) yield larger wall and base temperatures as more heat is delivered to the
ﬂuid. This is expected because the base heat ﬂux qb is maintained constant and a simple energy balance of the
evaporator yields qbWbL = qw(2Hch + Wch)L, such that qw (average heat ﬂux over all coupled ﬂuid-solid walls) must
increase as Wb increases, in order to deliver the increased heat load to the ﬂuid through the same exchange area
L(2Hch + Wch). For example, the energy balance suggests qw = 37.5 kW/m2 when W f = Dh/8 and qw = 66.7 kW/m2
when W f = Dh, as conﬁrmed by the wall heat ﬂux magnitudes achieved in Fig. 5(h). Owing to the high thermal

12

conductivity of copper, wall and base temperatures are almost overlapping in Fig. 5(g). A quick one-dimensional
heat conduction calculation across the evaporator base suggests that the base-wall temperature diﬀerence should be
≈ qbHb/λs ≈ 0.01 K, thus validating this observation. Nonetheless, the base-wall temperature diﬀerence increases as
the ﬁn width is decreased, because the vertical wall temperature decreases owing to the lower thermal resistance of
the ﬁn. Despite the diﬀerences observed in boxes (g) and (h), the Nusselt number proﬁles in Fig. 5(i) exhibit little
dependence on the ﬁn width, which is expected as the single-phase wall-ﬂuid convective heat exchange is not directly
impacted by the wall thickness.

4.3.2. Eﬀect of channel aspect-ratio

A comparison of the single-phase heat transfer performance for diﬀerent channel aspect-ratios and same ﬁn width
is provided with Fig. 6. Hch > Wch for ǫ = 0.25, and thus the shorter channel wall faces the base, whereas Wch > Hch
for ǫ = 4, where the longer wall is in contact with the evaporator base. The main diﬀerences between the two aspect-
ratios are related to the diﬀerent thicknesses of the thermal boundary layers developing over the channel walls. For
ǫ = 0.25, the boundary layer develops quickly over the shorter horizontal wall and the local Nusselt number declines
more rapidly, see Fig. 6(c), whereas heat convection over the horizontal wall remains eﬀective along the microchannel
for ǫ = 4, see Fig. 6(d), as the boundary layer over the wider wall developes more slowly. The situation is reversed
over the vertical channel wall, where heat transfer is more eﬀective for ǫ = 0.25, see Fig. 6(g) and (h), and the
heightwise temperature distribution becomes less uniform (Fig. 6(e)). When comparing the contours of the Nusselt
number over the wider wall, i.e. the vertical wall for ǫ = 0.25 (Fig. 6(g)) and the horizontal wall for ǫ = 2 (Fig. 6(d)),
slightly better heat transfer is achieved for ǫ = 0.25, owing to the adiabatic top boundary of the channel (at y/Hch = 1)
which allows for lower temperatures.

The streamwise proﬁles of cross-stream averaged temperature and heat ﬂux in Fig. 6(i) and (j) reveal that the wall
and base temperatures are signiﬁcantly lower for the smaller aspect-ratio channel, mainly because the heat applied
through the evaporator base is smaller owing to the shorter channel width. For example, the same energy balance
for the solid region appied above yields qw = 13 kW/m2 when ǫ = 0.25 and qw = 70 kW/m2 when ǫ = 4, both
with W f = Dh/8. Since qw increases with increasing ǫ, whereas the liquid mass ﬂux is maintained constant, higher
aspect-ratio channels lead to higher ﬂuid temperatures, thereby resulting in larger evaporator temperatures.

The cross-stream average Nusselt number depicted in Fig. 6(k) conﬁrms that the ﬂuid-solid heat transfer is rel-
atively insensitive to the ﬁn width, but performances are substantially diﬀerent for the two aspect-ratios despite
the fact that the hydraulic diameter and the ratio between the longer and shorter channel sides are the same (i.e.
four) for both conﬁgurations. Counterintuitively, the conﬁguration with ǫ = 0.25, where the shorter wall is in
contact with the hot evaporator base, yields a signiﬁcantly higher Nusselt number than that with the wider wall
facing the heat source (ǫ = 4). This can be easily explained by inspection of the contours of the Nusselt num-
ber in Fig. 6(d) and (g). The magnitudes of the Nusselt number over the vertical wall for ǫ = 0.25 are compa-
rable (or slightly higher) to those detected over the horizontal wall for ǫ = 4. However, owing to the three-side
heating conﬁguration, the heat transfer over the vertical wall contributes twice to the cross-stream average of Nuw,
Nuw(x) = [WchNuw,h(x) + 2HchNuw,v(x)]/(Wch + 2Hch), and therefore the heat transfer performance over the vertical
wall is twice as important as that over a horizontal wall of same size.

This aspect is investigated in detail in Fig. 7, where the average Nusselt number over the entire microchannel
heated walls (and separately for vertical and horizontal walls) is calculated using Eq. (14) and steady-state single-
phase data. Though the Nusselt number over the horizontal wall increases as ǫ increases and that over the vertical wall
decreases, and vice versa as ǫ → 0, see Fig. 7(a), the overall Nusselt number is larger at smaller aspect-ratios because,
as mentioned above, the microchannel wall with better Nusselt number (vertical wall) contributes twice to the overall
heat transfer. Shah and London [35] derived analytical solutions for hydrodynamically- and thermally-developed
laminar ﬂows in rectangular channels subject to nonuniform heating conditions and their results are displayed in
Fig. 7(b) together with the numerical data from the present work. While the Shah and London [35] results emphasize
that there would be no diﬀerence in Nusselt numbers between ǫ = 0.25 and 4 for uniform heating (Case 1), the heat
transfer performance increases monotonically with ǫ for single-side heating (Case 4), whereas Nuw exhibits a non-
monotonic trend for the three-side heating identiﬁed as Case 2, with the Nusselt number being larger at smaller aspect-
ratios in the range investigated in this study. Our numerical results follow very closely those for three-side heating,
though the magnitudes obtained with the simulations are slightly larger as the ﬂow is not thermally developed. The

evident diﬀerences among the trends of Nuw versus ǫ for diﬀerent heating conditions observed in Fig. 7 emphasise
the importance of including conjugate heat transfer in the microchannel model.

4.3.3. Analysis of the entire single-phase database

In order to compare all results for diﬀerent aspect-ratios and ﬁn widths, the whole numerical database of av-
erage base temperatures and wall heat ﬂuxes is compiled in Fig. 8(a) and (b). Base temperatures and heat ﬂuxes
follow similar trends for the reasons explained above. Lower evaporator base temperatures are achieved with smaller
channel aspect-ratios and thinner ﬁn widths, because less heat per ﬂuidic channel is applied to the evaporator. The
diﬀerences induced by the width of the ﬁns are less apparent at smaller aspect-ratios whereas they become more
pronounced as ǫ increases. The plots in Fig. 8 also include prediction curves obtained by means of a heat transfer
model for the evaporator and microchannel. Using a calculation procedure usually applied to derive heat transfer
coeﬃcients from temperature measurements in microchannel ﬂow boiling experiments [5, 16], we consider a model
of the evaporator composed of two resistences in series, the ﬁrst related to heat conduction through the evaporator
base, Rb = Hb/(λsWbL), and the second related to heat convection to the ﬂuid. The latter is calculated as the result of
two parallel thermal resistances, one over the horizontal and the other over the vertical channel walls. The resistance
to convection at the horizontal wall is expressed as Rw,h = (hw,hWchL)−1, with hw,h being the heat transfer coeﬃ-
cient at the horizontal wall, that over the vertical wall is expressed using the ﬁn eﬃciency, Rw,v = (ηhw,v2HchL)−1,
with η = tanh(mHch)/(mHch) and m =
2hw,v/(λsW f ). The overall resistance to convection is then calculated as
Rw = Rw,hRw,v/(Rw,h + Rw,v) and the total resistance of the system is Rtot = Rb + Rw. Since the heat applied to the
system via the evaporator base is known, Qb = qbWbL, the average base temperature can be estimated as:

region used before:

(18)

which are plotted as dashed lines in Fig. 8(b). The heat transfer model captures very well the base temperature and
wall heat ﬂux trends versus aspect-ratio and ﬁn width obtained with the numerical simulations, thus conﬁrming that
lower base temperatures can be achieved by decreasing the aspect-ratio of the microchannels. Figure 8(c) reports the
ratio of heat transferred through the horizontal or vertical wall and the base heat load, when varying the aspect-ratio
for W f = Dh/8. The predictions displayed as dashed lines are obtained as:

Qw,h =

Tw − T f
Rw,h

, Qw,v =

Tw − T f
Rw,v

(19)

where Tw = Tb − qbHb/λs; note that the model calculates an average wall temperature and does not discriminate
between horizontal and vertical wall temperatures. At smaller aspect-ratios, most of the heat is transferred through
the vertical wall (above 90% for ǫ = 0.25). Even for the square channel (ǫ = 1), the vertical wall contributes to about
70% of the heat dissipation to the ﬂuid, as the vertical wall counts twice on the overall heat transfer balance owing
to the three-side heating conﬁguration. At larger aspect-ratios, heat transfer through the horizontal wall takes over,
though the vertical wall still provides a considerable contribution, which explains the asymmetry on the proﬁles of the
Nusselt number around ǫ = 1 in Fig. 7.

4.4. Two-phase results

This section presents the results obtained with two-phase ﬂow simulations, in the range of aspect-ratios ǫ = 0.25−4
and ﬁn thicknesses W f = Dh/8 − Dh. To illustrate the bubble dynamics and heat transfer for a representative case,
Fig. 9 shows snapshots of the bubble growth and resulting microchannel temperatures as time elapses, for ǫ = 0.5 and
W f = Dh/2. At t = 0, the temperature ﬁeld corresponds to the single-phase steady-state solution. At the onset of the
two-phase ﬂow, the bubble grows expanding the dry vapour region over the bottom surface of the channel and, as its
diameter reaches Wch, a contact line is formed over the vertical wall. The inner vertical wall responds instantaneously
to the presence of the contact line, see the central box in Fig. 9(c), as manifested by the colder nearly-circular spot
revealed by the temperature contours, whereas this is not seen on the outer wall due to heat spreading. As the bubble
grows further, it elongates along the channel and the dry vapour regions expand, leaving thick liquid lobes at the
channel corners and thin liquid layers between the bubble nose and the downstream ends of the contact lines. As

the bubble and contact lines progress along the channel, the wall temperature reduces, exhibiting larger gradients
in the proximity of the contact lines. As the channel wall comes in contact with vapour in the dryout regions, the
wall temperature tends to become more uniform and to increase due to the less eﬃcient heat convection, though this
happens with some delay due to the thermal inertia of the solid.

4.4.1. Square channel and eﬀect of ﬁn width

We begin the two-phase analysis with discussing the results obtained for a reference case run with a square channel
(ǫ = 1). Figure 10 presents snapshots of the bubble surface and corresponding evaporator temperature ﬁelds for
ǫ = 0.5, 1, 2. For the square channel, the bubble front has a cylindrical shape which ﬂattens at the centre of the
channel walls. Dry vapour patches are formed near the tail of the bubble, at the centre of the channel walls. The
contours of temperature, wet fraction and Nusselt number over the microchannel walls detected at t = tend, when
the bubble nose reaches the outlet section, for W f = Dh/8, are shown in Fig. 11(a)-(f). At this stage, the bubble is
elongated and dry vapour patches are clearly visible on the channel walls in Fig. 11(c) and (d). Note that the wall dry
regions are identiﬁed as boundary faces where the face-interpolated liquid volume fraction is αw < 0.5, with αw > 0.5
identifying wet regions. Therefore, the boundaries between the blue and red regions in Fig. 11(c) and (d) do not have
to be interpreted as sharp liquid-vapour boundaries. As expected, the largest values of the Nusselt number coincide
with contact lines and very thin liquid ﬁlms. The temperature ﬁeld over the walls, Fig. 11(a) and (b), is very sensitive
to the two-phase ﬂow and the walls progressively cool down as the contact line sweeps them. Figure 11(g)-(i) reports
the bubble equivalent diameter and the spatial average of wall wet fraction and Nusselt number, both calculated as
indicated in Eq. (14), as time elapses for all the ﬁn widths tested. Time in the abscissa is expressed in terms of the
location of the bubble nose xN. The bubble growth rate increases with the ﬁn width, as a result of the larger amount
of heat stored by the solid regions during the previous single-phase stage, now dissipated in the form of latent heat.
As the bubble grows, dry vapour patches are formed and expand over the walls, explaining the descending trends
of αw with increasing time. For larger W f , the bubble nose propagates faster along the channel because the bubble
grows more rapidly, and thus thicker liquid ﬁlms are left at the channel walls, as expected from traditional lubrication
theory [36]. Thicker ﬁlms are less prone to dewetting and dryout, thus mitigating the expansion of dry regions and
explaining the ascending trends of αw with W f observed in Fig. 11(h). The liquid ﬁlm coverage of the wall explains

also the trends of the Nusselt number reported in Fig. 11(i). Nuw increases over time as the channel wall becomes
covered by a thin liquid ﬁlm and both contact line and thin ﬁlm evaporation contribute to cool down the wall. However,
the Nusselt number increases at a larger rate for a thicker ﬁn width, owing to the larger fraction of channel wall that
remains covered by a liquid ﬁlm. Note that the Nusselt number does not reach any steady-state or steady-periodic
value, because multiple nucleation cycles [37] and simulations over 100× larger time-scales (order of 10−1 s) would
be necessary for the temperature ﬁeld within the solid region to achieve a statistically steady regime.

4.4.2. Eﬀect of channel aspect-ratio

Next, the results for two diﬀerent aspect-ratios, ǫ = 0.5 and 2, are illustrated. Figure 10 shows bubble shapes and
corresponding evaporator temperature ﬁelds. Extended dry regions form over the wider channel walls, whereas much
smaller dry regions appear over the shorter walls; these features are discussed below. Contours of wall temperatures,
liquid and vapour fraction, and Nusselt numbers for ǫ = 0.5, 2 at same W f = Dh/8 are depicted in Fig. 12. The
contours of the dry and wet area fraction, Fig. 12(c), (d), (i) and (j), conﬁrm that larger dry regions develop over
wider walls, as observed in Fig. 10. This is a result of surface tension forces, that arrange the bubble cross-section

into circular arcs facing the shorter walls, where a thicker liquid ﬁlm develops, while the liquid-vapour interface is
rather ﬂat along the wider walls, where a thinner liquid ﬁlm is left [9, 13]. Since the capillary number of the ﬂow is
small, Ca = 0.0007, the liquid ﬁlm partially dries over both horizontal and vertical walls, but the dry area fraction is
smaller over the shorter wall owing to the thicker ﬁlm. It is interesting to note both in Fig. 12(d) and (i) that the dry
region at the upstream end of the contact line develops into two axial dry streaks at its downstream end. This is due
to the eﬀect of capillary forces on the thin ﬁlm covering the larger wall, that create a saddle-like ﬁlm proﬁle on the
channel cross-section, which is thicker at the channel centre and exhibits a dimple at the matching point with the static
meniscus at the side [9, 38]. Dryout initiates in coincidence with this interfacial dimple where the ﬁlm is the thinnest
[39, 40], as observed in Fig. 12(d) and (i) and, owing to the hydrophilic walls, a narrow liquid ligament still exists
along the wall centreline between the two dry regions, although it eventually evaporates and dries out, thus leaving an
extended dry region. Dry patches are more extended for ǫ = 0.5, because the bubble grows more slowly due to the
lower wall temperature. The white lines included in Fig. 12(c), (d), (i), and (j), indicate the bubble proﬁles extracted
along channel centreplanes, and reveal that the liquid ligament (e.g., Fig. 12(c), x/Dh = 9 − 14) is thicker than the
liquid ﬁlm established in the downstream fully-wetted region (x/Dh > 14). This is due to the fact that surface tension
rearranges the cross-sectional proﬁle of the liquid-vapour interface from the fully-wetted to the partially-dry region.
In the downstream wet region, the ﬁlm thickness is determined by the meniscus at the channel corners [9], whereas
the thickness of the liquid ligament is determined by the contact angle.

The temperature and Nusselt number contours in Fig. 12 are a result of the liquid ﬁlm and contact line distribution
along shorter and larger channel walls, as such the contours of Tw,h (or Tw,v) for ǫ = 0.5 are qualitatively similar to
those of Tw,v (or Tw,h) for ǫ = 2, with the Nusselt number following analogous trends. The only apparent diﬀerences
are on the contours of temperature over the larger wall, Fig. 12(b) and (g), where the vertical wall for ǫ = 0.5 restarts
heating up in the dry vapour region.

A quantitative comparison of the results for ǫ = 0.5 and 2 and diﬀerent ﬁn widths is presented in Fig. 13. The
vapour bubble grows more rapidly for ǫ = 2 because the microchannel walls are warmer, as a result of the previous
single-phase steady-state temperature ﬁeld, see Fig. 6. As a consequence, the larger aspect-ratio channel exhibits
smaller dry vapour patches and larger wet area fraction (Fig. 13(b)), although the curves of αw for the two aspect-
ratios converge as the ﬁn width increases. Although the Nusselt numbers over the wider walls (vertical wall for
ǫ = 0.5, horizontal for ǫ = 2) are of comparable magnitude, Fig. 13(c) shows that higher average Nusselt numbers

are achieved for a smaller aspect-ratio, since the vertical wall counts twice towards Nuw. The situation is reversed for

W f = Dh/8, see the green curves in Fig. 13(c), which is the case illustrated in Fig. 12, because the bubble grows much
faster for the larger aspect-ratio channel and therefore the wet area fraction for ǫ = 2 is considerably higher than that
for ǫ = 0.5.

4.4.3. Conjugate heat transfer analysis

To better reveal the nonuniform temperature distribution within the solid regions, Fig. 14 shows cross-sectional
temperature ﬁelds within both solid and ﬂuid, extracted half-way along the evaporator, for ǫ = 0.5, 1, 2, and two
selected values of ﬁn thicknesses. The images also include the proﬁle of the liquid-vapour interface on the cross-

section. When W f = Dh/8, Fig. 14(a), (c) and (e), the bubble grows at a slower rate than W f = Dh and the liquid ﬁlm
over the wider walls is dry at the displayed cross-section, except for ǫ = 2 where the bubble grows faster owing to
the warmer wall; thus, a narrow liquid ligament is left between the dry regions at the sides, as observed in Fig. 12(d).
Thicker liquid ﬁlms always cover the shorter walls at the selected cross-sections. When W f = Dh, Fig. 14(b), (d)
and (f), the bubble grows more rapidly as the channel walls are warmer and thin liquid ﬁlms cover the channel walls
for all aspect-ratios; the saddle-like shape of the liquid-vapour interface over the wider walls is clearly evident in
Fig. 14(b) and (f), with minimum ﬁlm thickness regions appearing at the matching point between the static meniscus
at the corner and the thin ﬁlm at the wall centre. By inspection of the temperature ﬁeld in the solid and ﬂuid regions,
it is evident that the temperature is more uniform in the solid due to its much larger thermal conductivity. Larger
temperatures are measured in both the ﬂuid and solid as the aspect-ratio increases due to the increased heat load
through the evaporator base. The impact of contact lines and thin ﬁlms on the solid wall temperature are apparent.
Temperature is the lowest near contact lines and very thin ﬁlms, e.g. in the correspondence of the interface dimples
for ǫ = 0.5, 2, while temperatures are higher where thicker ﬁlms cover the walls. Wall temperatures remain relatively
low in dry vapour regions, due to the thermal inertia of the solid. Negligible temperature variation is observed in the
horizontal direction across the evaporator ﬁns for thin walls (W f = Dh/8), whereas horizontally-oriented gradients
become evident for thicker walls (W f = Dh), depending on the local liquid ﬁlm morphology.

4.4.4. Base temperatures and analysis of the entire two-phase database

The contours of temperature of the evaporator base for both single-phase (steady-state) and two-phase (t = tend)
simulations, ǫ = 0.5, 1, 2 and W f = Dh/8 are presented in Fig. 15. As discussed previously, temperatures increase
when increasing ǫ and more heat must be dissipated by the ﬂuid. For single-phase ﬂow, the spanwise distribution of
temperature is uniform. The formation of a contact line and an evaporating ﬁlm which are both advancing along the
channel cool down the walls and this eﬀect is propagated to the evaporator base via heat conduction through the solid.
The cooling of the evaporator base is manifested by the isolines of temperature shifting downstream in Fig. 15(b), (d)
and (f). The spanwise temperature proﬁle for the two-phase ﬂow stays rather uniform for ǫ = 0.5 and 1 owing to the
limited extension of the evaporating ﬁlm, whereas for ǫ = 2 the base centreline appears colder than the corners due
to the wide liquid ﬁlm established over the horizontal wall; however, part of this ﬁlm eventually dries out and as time
elapses the less eﬀective solid-vapour heat convection may lead to a local increase of temperatures.

To compare all the two-phase results at varying aspect-ratios and ﬁn widths, the entire two-phase database is com-
piled in the ﬁnal Fig. 16. Base and wall temperatures, Fig. 16(a) and (b), conﬁrm that lower evaporator temperatures
are achieved by smaller channel aspect-ratios and ﬁn widths, as less heat is delievered to the evaporator through the
narrower base surface, when the heat ﬂux is maintained constant. Therefore, the present results support the conclusion
that, for a given heat ﬂux and evaporator width, accommodating multiple low-aspect-ratio microchannels guarantees
lower temperatures than a few or one only high-aspect-ratio microchannel; this aspect is discussed further in Sec. 5.
This result is in agreement with the experiments of Al-Zaidi et al. [5], who found that multi-microchannel evaporators
with lower aspect-ratio channels yield smaller wall superheat for the same base heat ﬂux. The heat ﬂux at the wall-
ﬂuid boundary, Fig. 16(c)-(e), increases with the ﬁn width as more heat must be delivered to the ﬂuid through the same
wall-ﬂuid contact area. The heat ﬂux through the horizontal wall, Fig. 16(d), increases monotonically with ǫ owing
to the increasingly wider evaporating liquid ﬁlm. A similar trend is observed over the vertical wall as the aspect-ratio
is reduced from ǫ = 4 to ǫ = 1, see Fig. 16(e), however a non-monotonic behavior of qw,v occurs as ǫ → 0, because
the bubble grows proressively more slowly due to the lower wall temperatures, and thus extended dry vapour patches
appear over the vertical wall; see wet area fractions in Fig. 16(k). This eﬀect is ampliﬁed for thinner evaporator ﬁns,
as temperatures are lower thus decreasing further the bubble growth rate. Note that the average two-phase heat ﬂux
reaches values as high as 1 MW/m2, corresponding to above 3 W dissipated by the ﬂuid. This value is about 10 times
larger than the heat load applied to the evaporator base, which is possible because the evaporator is not at steady-state,
and liquid evaporation is fed by the sensible heat stored within the evaporator walls. It is worth inspecting the plots
of the wet area fraction in Fig. 16(i)-(k) before discussing those of the Nusselt number. Over the horizontal wall, dry
patches are small because when ǫ < 1 surface tension forces leave a thick ﬁlm, see for example Fig. 14(a) and (b),
whereas when ǫ > 1 the bubble grows faster thus depositing a thicker ﬁlm that better resists dryout. Over the vertical
wall, channels with ǫ > 1 leave a thick ﬁlm, whereas when ǫ < 1 large dry patches appear (Fig. 14(a)) because the
bubble propagates more slowly and the thin ﬁlm deposited by the bubble nose dewets rapidly. The wet area fraction
trends have a direct impact on the Nusselt number plots in Fig. 16(f)-(h). Since dry patches over the horizontal wall

are small, Nuw,h shows a monotonic ascending trend when increasing ǫ, because an increasingly larger fraction of the
channel perimeter is covered by a thin ﬁlm which promotes heat transfer. For the same reason, an analogous ascending
trend occurs for Nuw,v when decreasing the aspect-ratio from ǫ = 4 to about ǫ = 0.5. However, this trend changes
when ǫ < 0.5 due to a sudden drop of Nuw,v. The latter happens due to the large dry patches that form over the vertical
walls when ǫ → 0, as explained above. The fall of Nuw,v at low aspect-ratios is mitigated by larger evaporator ﬁns,
which maintain larger temperatures thus promoting faster bubbles and thicker liquid ﬁlms. The resulting trends of
the average Nusselt number versus ǫ reported in Fig. 16(f) are mixed. For smaller evaporator ﬁns, the overall Nusselt
number increases somewhat monotonically with the channel aspect-ratio, due to the steep increase of the wall wet
fraction. However, for thicker ﬁns, the drop of Nuw,v as ǫ → 0 is less severe and a nonmonotonic trend of Nuw for
increasing aspect-ratios is observed.

Al-Zaidi et al. [5] reported an increasing trend of the heat transfer coeﬃcient when increasing ǫ in the range
ǫ = 0.5 − 2, using the ﬂuid HFE7100 in Dh = 0.46 mm channels with W f = 0.1 mm. They calculated the heat transfer
coeﬃcient from temperature and heat ﬂux measurements via thermocouples installed below the horizontal wall of

the microchannel, and therefore their heat transfer trends should be compared with our numerical trends for Nuw,h,
Fig. 16(g). The trends are in good agreement and the numerical results conﬁrm Al-Zaidi et al. [5] interpretation that

the higher heat transfer coeﬃcient achieved by ǫ = 2 can be explained with the presence of an extended evaporating
ﬁlm over the horizontal wall.

5. Discussion

The results presented in the previous section emphasise that there are two relevant parameters to describe the
performance of an evaporator, the average Nusselt number Nuw and the base temperature Tb, which do not necessarily
follow the same trends when varying the channel aspect-ratio ǫ.

The single-phase results provided in Fig. 7 show that Nuw drops by about 33% when increasing the aspect-ratio
from ǫ = 0.25 to 4, to which it corresponds a three/fourfold increase of the base superheat, see Fig. 8(a), due to the
combined eﬀect of lower Nuw and higher ﬂuid temperature. Nonetheless, the single-phase results exhibit a systematic
trend of increasing Nuw and decreasing Tb when ǫ < 1, thus suggesting that multichannel heat sinks with low aspect-
ratio channels ensure better heat transfer and lower base temperatures, when operating in single-phase regime.

The situation is less clear when the heat sink operates in two-phase ﬂow boiling conditions, because Fig. 16(f)
indicates that the Nusselt number exhibits non-monotonic trends versus ǫ, and the base temperatures reported in
Fig. 16(a) are not at steady-state and thus some kind of model is necessary to extrapolate their values to steady-state
conditions. If the heat transfer coeﬃcients over the longer vertical walls for ǫ < 1 were of similar magnitudes to
those over corresponding longer horizontal walls for ǫ > 1, it would be expected that Nuw increase monotonically for
ǫ → 0, as observed in the single-phase conﬁguration. However, the two-phase Nusselt numbers reported in Fig. 16(f)
show mixed trends when varying ǫ and the ﬁn width W f , as such it is not possible to draw a ﬁrm conclusion about
which aspect-ratio maximises two-phase heat transfer. In microchannel two-phase ﬂow, where slug ﬂow and annular

ﬂow are dominant ﬂow patterns [41], Nuw is directly related to the thickness and distribution of liquid ﬁlms and dry
vapour patches over the heated walls, which depend on a number of hydrodynamic and thermodynamic parameters.
Even so, the beneﬁcial eﬀect of a higher Nusselt number for a speciﬁc value of ǫ may be outweighed by the intrinsic
thermal resistance of the whole evaporator [5].

To further investigate this aspect, we extend here the heat transfer model of the evaporator developed in Sec. 4.3.3
to account for a two-phase ﬂow, where we assume that T f = T sat, and consider an evaporator of total base width Wtot
(base area Ab = WtotL), featuring Nch parallel microchannels. Therefore, Eq. (16) can be rewritten as:

where Rtot = Rb + Rw and these two thermal resistances are now expressed for the entire evaporator width as:

Tb = T sat + qbAbRtot

Rb =

Hb
λsAb

, Rw =

Rw,hRw,v
Rw,h + Rw,v

Nch

(20)

(21)

where Nch = Wtot/(Wch + W f ), therefore the number of microchannels that can be accommodated depends on their
aspect-ratio and the ﬁn width. Equation (20) can therefore be rewritten as:

Tb = T sat +

qbHb
λs

+ qbAbRw

(22)

where the heat convection resistance at the channel wall, Rw, is the only parameter dependent on ǫ. Using the same
expressions for the heat convection resistance over the vertical and horizontal walls of the channel developed in
Sec. 4.3.3, and taking hw,h = hw,v = hw, Rw can be expressed as:

Rw =

ǫ
Ab

1 + 2W f /[Dh(1 + ǫ)]
hw(ǫ + 2η)

(23)

which shows that Rw ∼ ǫ such that the thermal resistance decreases as the aspect-ratio is reduced, and so does the
evaporator base temperature by virtue of Eq. (20). It is possible to use Eq. (23) to estimate the resistance to convective
heat transfer per unit area, RwAb, for the two-phase conﬁguration studied in this paper. Using W f = Dh/8 and hw from

26

the data in Fig. 16(f), RwAb = 5.7 [W/(mm2 K)]−1 for ǫ = 0.25 and RwAb = 8.7 [W/(mm2 K)]−1 for ǫ = 4. Therefore,
despite Nuw ≈ 27 for ǫ = 4 while Nuw ≈ 12 for ǫ = 0.25 (see data for W f = Dh/8 in Fig. 16(f)), the thermal resistance
to convective heat transfer Rw is still much lower for the lower aspect-ratio channel, and Eq. (20) suggests that, at
steady-state, Tb = 373.7 K for ǫ = 0.25, versus Tb = 374 K for ǫ = 4.

In summary, though our two-phase numerical results and steady-state model outlined above seem to suggest that
microchannels with ǫ < 1 promote lower evaporator temperatures, no absolute answer emerges as to which channel
conﬁguration yields the best heat transfer or lowest base temperature. This is expected to depend on the interplay of
heat transfer within the solid regions of the evaporator, bubble dynamics and cross-sectional liquid ﬁlm morphology,
which should all be incorporated into a novel three-zone model [42, 43] to predict boiling heat transfer in noncircular
channels, to provide physics-based guidelines for the design of multichannel evaporators.

6. Conclusions

Flow boiling in a multi-microchannel evaporator was simulated by modelling one single channel and the sur-
rounding walls. The opensource software OpenFOAM v2106 and the built-in geometric Volume Of Fluid method
were employed, with self-developed functions improving the estimation of the surface tension and phase-change rate.
Square and rectangular microchannels were considered, with aspect-ratios varying in the range ǫ = 0.25 − 4 and
widths W f = Dh/8 − Dh of the wall separating adjacent channels. The channel hydraulic diameter, base heat ﬂux,
mass ﬂux and ﬂuid properties were maintained constant throughout this work, and water at the saturation temperature
of T sat = 100 ◦C was the working ﬂuid. The channel walls were set as hydrophilic. The analysis of both single-phase
and two-phase ﬂuid dynamics and heat transfer mechanisms led to the following conclusions:

• Heat is transferred to the ﬂuid through the bottom wall and the two vertical walls at the sides of the channel,
thus the heating conﬁguration corresponds to a three-side heated channel. Conjugate heat transfer and channel
shape have a profound impact on heat transfer.

• In the single-phase regime, the three-side conﬁguration leads to increasing Nusselt numbers as smaller aspect-
ratio channels are considered, as the vertical wall contributes twice to the average convective heat transfer
performance.

• For the conﬁguration studied, increasing heat loads are delivered to the ﬂuid when the channel aspect-ratio or
ﬁn width are increased. In single-phase ﬂow, this corresponds to increasingly higher evaporator temperatures,
and therefore the best heat removal performance are achieved when ǫ < 1.

• In the two-phase regime, the bubble quickly becomes elongated under the conditions studied. Local heat transfer
rates are the highest, and evaporator temperatures the lowest, in coincidence with liquid-vapour-solid contact
lines and thin liquid ﬁlms.

• Extended thin liquid ﬁlms form over the wider microchannel walls, while thicker ﬁlms are left over shorter
walls. The thickness of the ﬁlm over each wall depends on the bubble speed. At high aspect-ratios, walls are
warmer and the bubble grows faster, leaving thicker liquid ﬁlms that better resist dryout. At low aspect-ratios,
bubbles grow more slowly and the thin ﬁlm over the wider wall dewets leaving extended dry vapour patches
which contribute poorly to heat transfer.

• The Nusselt number of the two-phase ﬂow is directly related to the thickness and morphology of liquid ﬁlm and
dry patches at the microchannel walls. The trends of Nuw versus ǫ are mixed, although for smaller channel ﬁns
an ascending trend for increasing aspect-ratios is apparent.

• Due to the conjugate heat transfer, the heat transfer coeﬃcient and evaporator base temperature exhibit con-
trasting trends when varying channel aspect-ratio. The present results and a steady-state heat transfer model for
the evaporator suggest that conﬁgurations with ǫ < 1 promote lower evaporator temperatures even when their
Nuw is below that achieved for ǫ > 1, with the higher heat transfer coeﬃcient of the latter being outweighed by
the larger overall thermal resistance of the system.

27

This work suggests that it is diﬃcult to draw a general conclusion about which channel aspect-ratio maximises boiling
heat transfer, or minimises the evaporator base temperature. This is the result of the interplay among conjugate heat
transfer in the solid, bubble, liquid ﬁlm dynamics and two-phase heat transfer, and only a prediction model incorporat-
ing all relevant hydrodynamics and heat exchange processes can provide an optimised heat sink conﬁguration, which
is expected to be case-dependent and vary according to operating conditions and working ﬂuid.
