ABSTRACT

The presence of elongations in active region (AR) polarities, called magnetic tongues, are mostly visi-
ble during their emergence phase. AR tilts have been measured thoroughly using long-term white-light
(WL) databases, sometimes combined with magnetic ﬁeld information. Since the inﬂuence of magnetic
tongues on WL tilt measurements has not been taken into account before, we aim to investigate their
role in tilt-angle values and to compare them with those derived from LOS magnetograms. We apply
four methods to compute the tilt angle of generally bipolar ARs: one applies the k-means algorithm
to WL data, a second one includes the magnetic ﬁeld sign of the polarities to WL data, and a third
one uses the magnetic ﬂux-weighted center of each polarity. The tilt values computed in any of these
ways are aﬀected by the presence of magnetic tongues. Therefore, we apply the newly developed Core
Field Fit Estimator (CoFFE) method to separate the magnetic ﬂux in the tongues from that in the
AR core. We compare the four computed tilt-angle values, as well as these with the ones reported in
long-term WL databases. For ARs with low magnetic ﬂux tongues the diﬀerent methods report con-
sistent tilt-angle values. But for ARs with high ﬂux tongues there are noticeable discrepancies between
all methods indicating that magnetic tongues aﬀect diﬀerently WL and magnetic data. However, in
general, CoFFE achieves a better estimation of the main bipole tilt because it removes both the eﬀect
of tongues as well as the emergence of secondary bipoles when it occurs in between the main bipole
magnetic polarities.

The simplest manifestation of an active region (AR)
is in the form of a magnetic bipolar conﬁguration, i.e.
made of a main positive and a main negative polarity
(van Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015). Furthermore, ARs
with two sunspots or sunspot groups of opposite mag-
netic polarity, called a β conﬁguration, form the large
majority of ARs all along the solar cycle (Jaeggli & Nor-
ton 2016); therefore, it is worth to study and under-
stand general AR properties using mainly bipolar ARs.
Large sets of observational data, theoretical develop-
ments (i.e. dynamo models, see e.g., the reviews of Char-

Poisson et al.

bonneau 2014; Brun & Browning 2017, and references
therein), as well as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) sim-
ulations (see the reviews by Fan 2009a; Cheung & Isobe
2014; Toriumi 2014, and references therein), support the
idea that bipolar active regions are the consequence of
the emergence of magnetic ﬂux tubes. These ﬂux tubes,
which have been called Ω loops (Zwaan 1987), origi-
nate in the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld created by the dy-
namo mechanism in the convection zone. Their ﬁeld is
ampliﬁed and deformed by diﬀerential rotation and con-
vective motions until they become buoyant and emerge
in the form of twisted ﬂux-tubes or ﬂux ropes
(FRs,
Fan 2009b; Nelson et al. 2013). However, other MHD
simulations explain the formation of ARs due to the lo-
cal ampliﬁcation and structuring of the magnetic ﬁeld in
the upper layers of the convective zone (see the review
by Brandenburg 2018).

As the toroidal magnetic ﬂux rises through the con-
vection zone, the Coriolis force acts on the FRs so that
they emerge slightly inclined relative to the eastwest (E-
W) direction (see e.g., Karak & Miesch 2017; Caligari
et al. 1995; Fisher et al. 1995; Fan et al. 1994; D’Silva
& Choudhuri 1993). This tendency to have the lead-
ing polarity of an AR located towards the solar Equator
relative to the following polarity was ﬁrst studied by
Hale et al. (1919) and is referred to as Joy’s law (van
Driel-Gesztelyi & Green 2015). Observationally, this law
implies that the axis joining the centers of the main po-
larities of an AR forms an angle, called tilt angle, with
respect to the E-W direction.

The existence of tilt angles in ARs plays a central part
in ﬂux-transport dynamo models, as Joy’s law is a fun-
damental ingredient for the formation and evolution of
the polar ﬁeld (see the review by Wang 2017, and refer-
ences therein). Therefore, obtaining a good estimation
of tilt angles, their evolution, and spatial variation on
the Sun surface plays a key role in constraining this kind
of dynamo models.

Tilt angles have been derived since long using
databases from white-light (WL) photographic observa-
tions taken at Mount Wilson Observatory from 1917 to
1985 and Kodaikanal Solar Observatory from 19061987
(see e.g., Howard et al. 1984; Sivaraman et al. 1993).
The longest existing catalog of sunspots is the Green-
wich Photoheliographic Results (1874 – 1976, see e.g.,
Willis et al. 2013). After 1976, Debrecen Heliophysical
Observatory developed another WL catalog. The De-
brecen Photoheliographic Data is compiled using WL
full-disk observations taken at Debrecen Observatory
and its Gyula Observing Station (Gy˝ori et al. 2011;
Baranyi et al. 2016). There are also two extensions
of this database that include magnetic ﬁeld informa-

tion. The SOHO/MDI Debrecen data (SDD) includes
magnetic and continuum images taken by the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO: Scherrer et al. 1995)
with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument,
while the SDO/HMI Debrecen Data uses the magnetic
and WL images taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI: Schou et al. 2012) instrument onboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO: Pesnell et al. 2012).
The evolution of photospheric magnetograms is the
main source of information on the characteristics of sub-
photospheric FRs.
In particular, a noticeable feature
is the presence of magnetic tongues (see Poisson et al.
2016, and references therein). They appear as elonga-
tions of the main AR polarities and are mainly observed
during the emergence of the top part of Ω-shaped ﬂux
ropes. They are produced by the line-of-sight (LOS)
projection of the azimuthal component of the FR mag-
netic ﬁeld. L´opez Fuentes et al. (2000) were the ﬁrst to
report their existence and, progressively, they were no-
ticed in many other examples (see e.g., Luoni et al. 2011;
Mandrini et al. 2014; Valori et al. 2015; Yardley et al.
2016; Vemareddy & D´emoulin 2017; Dacie et al. 2018;
L´opez Fuentes et al. 2018). These elongated features
are also present in MHD simulations of FR emergence
(Archontis & Hood 2010; Cheung et al. 2010; MacTag-
gart 2011; Jouve et al. 2013; Rempel & Cheung 2014;
Takasao et al. 2015). The presence of magnetic tongues
naturally modiﬁes the photospheric magnetic distribu-
tion of ﬂux concentrations and, therefore, tilt-angle mea-
surements done directly on LOS magnetograms. Fur-
thermore, since sunspots and pores are present in the
strongest magnetic ﬁelds, magnetic tongues are also ex-
pected to modify WL images.

In several articles, we have qualitatively and quanti-
tatively investigated the presence and role of magnetic
tongues during the emergence of bipolar ARs. Poisson
et al. (2015) presented a systematic method, based on
the evolution of the photospheric inversion line (PIL), to
quantify the inﬂuence of magnetic tongues in emerging
FRs. The method allowed us to estimate their average
twist, assuming that the emerging magnetic ﬁeld can be
represented as a uniformly twisted half torus (see also
Luoni et al. 2011). Poisson et al. (2016) studied how
the tongues aﬀect the evolution of the magnetic ﬂux
distribution of bipolar ARs, extending the analysis to
ARs observed along more than a solar cycle. Since it
was found that emerging ARs have a wide set of twist
proﬁles, a more sophisticated FR emergence model was
developed that considered FR cross-sections with non-
uniform twists (both in the radial and azimuthal direc-
tions).

However, though in these articles it was shown that
the presence of tongues has a non-negligible eﬀect in
the determination of the tilt of ARs, none of them de-
veloped a method to remove this eﬀect from the intrinsic
characteristics of emerging FRs. A method, called Core
Field Fit Estimator (CoFFE), has just been presented
by Poisson et al. (2020). CoFFE succeeds to remove
most of the magnetic tongues eﬀect on the computation
of the location of the ﬂux-weighted centers (magnetic
barycenters) of the polarities and, hence, it allows to
obtain an AR tilt-angle that better represents the FR
intrinsic tilt.

In this article, we investigate the role of magnetic
tongues on the measurements of tilt angles of sunspot
groups derived from WL images. To facilitate the read-
ing of this article in the top block of Table 1 we list
the acronyms most used in our text, their meanings,
and the databases to which they refer or are applied to;
while in its bottom block we enumerate the diﬀerent tilt-
angle names, the method used to compute them, and the
data to which they refer or are applied to. In Section 2,
we describe the data we use in our tilt-angle computa-
tions. Our methods to compute the tilt values using
WL images alone and combining them with magnetic
ﬁeld data, as well as a summary of the CoFFE method
applied to magnetograms, are described in Section 3.
Next, Section 4 presents the results of the application
of the previous methods to a set of bipolar ARs with
diﬀerent observed photospheric magnetic ﬂux distribu-
tions, i.e. from cases in which tongues are not evident
to those with clearly elongated tongues and even some
examples with more than one bipole present. We com-
pare the results obtained with these diﬀerent methods
and also with those found in the SDD catalog. Finally,
in Section 5 we summarize our ﬁndings and conclude.

2. DATA USED

We use continuum intensity images and LOS magne-
tograms obtained with MDI. The full-disk WL images
are constructed with the combination of ﬁve ﬁltergrams
with wavelengths around the Ni i absorption line. These
images have a noise per pixel of 0.3%. The LOS magne-
tograms are constructed onboard SOHO by measuring
the Zeeman eﬀect in right and left circularly polarized
light. The magnetograms from the 96-minute series,
obtained from 5-minute averaged magnetograms, have
lower noise level than the 1-hour series (that includes
magnetic and WL data) and an error per pixel of ≈ 9 G
(Liu et al. 2004). Both magnetograms and intensity im-
ages have a spatial resolution of 1.98(cid:48)(cid:48) and are digitized
with the same CCD with a size of 1024 × 1024 pixels.
We use all the available WL images from the 1-hour and

1-minute data sets closer in time to the magnetograms
from the 96-minute cadence data set.

As we aim to characterize the tilt angle evolution in
emerging ARs, we selected eight ARs for which we see
a clear emergence across their transit through the solar
disk. For all the cases we limit the latitudinal and lon-
gitudinal range of the selected ARs within −35◦ to 35◦
from the disk center to reduce the foreshortening and
limb darkening eﬀects (Green et al. 2003).

We process the WL images and the magnetograms to
construct two sets of data cubes for each analyzed AR.
Using standard solar software tools, we transform the
LOS component of the magnetic ﬁeld to the solar ra-
dial direction. As we study ARs located near the solar
disk center, the latter approximation produces no signif-
icant eﬀect on the resulting magnetic ﬂux density (Green
et al. 2003). Next, we rotate the set of magnetograms
and WL images to the time when the AR was located
at the central meridian. This procedure corrects the so-
lar diﬀerential rotation using the coeﬃcients derived by
Howard et al. (1990). Next, we select a sub region which
encompasses the AR. Any image presenting evidence of
wrong pixels and/or corrupted data are removed from
the set.

In order to detect the umbra regions, we apply a few
processing tools from the OpenCV Python 3 package to
the WL images. First we rescale the continuum inten-
sity levels of all the WL images corresponding to the
evolution of an AR using the global maximum and min-
imum of the set. Then, we convert the pixel intensities
to an unsigned 8-bit integer number, this ﬁxes the num-
ber of the intensity levels of the image to 255. This
conversion is in line with previous studies, including the
method used with SDD (Gy˝ori 1998). Pattern recogni-
tion algorithms, including the one used here to detect
the umbra, also include this conversion to improve the
algorithm performance. We increase the image contrast
in 10% and reduce the brightness in 50% to desaturate
the intensity observed in the photosphere. Finally we
apply a 2D ﬁlter to emphasize the diﬀerences in adjacent
pixel values. This ﬁlter performs a linear convolution of
the image with a 3 × 3 matrix, or kernel, chosen to in-
crease the image sharpness and, therefore, facilitate the
detection of the edges.

We compare our tilt-angle values deduced from WL
umbra detection with those reported in SDD. SDD has
free access to ftp data request and an online catalog
with sunspot-group information (Gy˝ori et al. 2010). The
sunspot groups in this catalog are labeled with the same
number as the one assigned by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to ARs. The cat-
alog combines the image processing algorithms, sunspot

techniques are also applied to MDI magnetograms (see
Section 1), therefore SDD also includes the information
on the magnetic polarity signs.

3. TILT-ANGLE ESTIMATION METHODS

3.1. Tilt Angle from WL Images

Methods to compute the tilt angle from continuum
images start with the identiﬁcation of the umbra areas
within a sunspot group. These methods can be sepa-
rated in two groups. The ﬁrst group corresponds to the
threshold methods (TMs), which are based on the se-
lection of a cut-oﬀ value for the image intensity levels
(Chapman & Groisman 1984; Steinegger et al. 1996).
The second group are border methods, which use a gra-
dient map to identify the abrupt changes of the image
intensity between the umbra-penumbra interface. The
method described by Gy˝ori (1998) is an example of the
latter group and is the one used on SDD to automati-
cally register the information of umbra areas of sunspot
groups.

Tilt angles can be determined from WL images using
only the sunspot umbrae or including their penumbrae.
The penumbra is in general easier to detect than the um-
bra at earlier stages of an AR emergence. However, its
detection can be aﬀected by the presence of dark penum-
bral ﬁlaments, granular local minima, and/or back-
ground magnetic ﬁeld remnants, which can produce dark
features around pores. Then, tilt angles obtained from
area-weighted penumbra centers are frequently strongly
aﬀected by these extra features. To avoid determining
erroneous tilts, we only consider the values obtained us-
ing umbra areas from images processed as summarized

in Section 2. In this way tilt values are less noisy, though
we have more data gaps at the beginning of the emer-
gence.

Many of the past sunspot records have no magnetic
polarity information (see, e.g., Howard 1991); therefore,
it is necessary to use a proximity-based algorithm ﬁrst
to isolate a sunspot group, and then to identify the lead-
ing and the following spots or polarities of an assumed
bipolar AR. To do so an area-weighted umbra center of
the group is computed, and then the leading (following)
portion of the group is assigned to the spots located to
the solar west (east) of this center.

We use a similar procedure based on the k-means clus-
tering algorithm (MacQueen 1967) to explore the consis-
tency between the diﬀerent grouping procedures. This
iterative procedure requires the input of the number of
groups, k. In our case k = 2, one corresponding to the
leading polarity and one to the following one. Then,
each of the separated umbrae are associated to one of
these groups. The routine computes the distance be-
tween the center of each umbra to assigned group cen-
ters. Initially, the group centers are located at random
positions within the image; then, the procedure deﬁnes
new group centers and/or new associations until the
global mean distance of each umbra to each group center
reaches a minimum. In other words, the routine seeks to
minimize the functional deﬁned as the distance between
the umbra centers and the group centers. Once an op-
timal grouping is achieved, we deﬁne the group located
to the solar west as the leading polarity and the one at
the solar east as the following one.

SOHO/MDI magnetograms allow us to use the mag-
netic ﬁeld information to separate the leading and the
following umbrae. Using the magnetic-ﬁeld sign group-
ing helps us understand the limitations and errors of the

AR Tilt Angles from White-Light Images and Magnetograms

methods described above. In particular, it can identify
inconsistencies between the diﬀerent catalogs due to a
wrong assignment of umbrae to the leading or follow-
ing group; this can result in tilt values computed from
sunspots having the same polarity sign (Baranyi 2015).
The umbra areas and their polarity sign information
let us derive diﬀerent estimations of the tilt angle. The
tilt angle is obtained as the acute angle formed between
the east-west direction and the line that joins the um-
bra area-weighted centers of the leading and following
polarities. We determine two diﬀerent tilt angles from
the umbra areas, depending on the grouping algorithm.
We deﬁne the tilt angle φWL
U derived from the proxim-
ity algorithm (k-means grouping) and φWLM
as the tilt
U
derived considering the magnetic ﬁeld sign of the um-
brae. An example is shown in Figure 1a with the umbra
detection done on an MDI WL image corresponding to
AR 9906 observed on 2002-04-14.

From now on, the data of all ARs are plotted with
the same drawing convention (see the caption of Fig-
ure 1). For each AR the same subregion is shown for
WL images and magnetograms (ﬁgure panels and asso-
ciated movies). The spatial coordinates are relative to
the bottom left corner, with the X coordinate growing
towards the solar west and Y towards the solar north.
When the leading polarity is closer to the equator than
the following one, as it is the case for most ARs (Joy’s
law), we deﬁne tilt angle as positive.

3.2. Tilt Angles from Magnetic Barycenters and

Tongues

LOS magnetograms allow us to study the evolution of
AR tilt-angles. The tilt angle is in general derived from
LOS magnetograms using the magnetic barycenters (see
L´opez Fuentes et al. 2000). Then, as with the WL area-
weighted centers, we deﬁne the apparent tilt angle, φM
a ,
as the acute angle formed between the E-W direction
and the segment that joins the barycenters. We call the
tilt values derived in this way the magnetic barycenters
(MB) method.

However, the value of φM
is not an exact estima-
a
tion of the intrinsic tilt angle of the FR that forms the
AR (Poisson et al. 2020). As summarized in Section 1,
the intrinsic FR tilt-angle is modiﬁed by the magnetic
tongues present during the AR emergence. Indeed, the
departure of φM
from the intrinsic tilt can be signiﬁ-
a
cantly larger than the mean dispersion reported in most
of Joy’s law studies (e.g., Wang et al. 2015).

To illustrate the morphology of magnetic tongues and
help us understanding their inﬂuence on tilt-angle mea-
surements, we select AR 9906 that has well-developed
magnetic tongues (Figure 1). Magnetic tongues are ob-

served in LOS magnetograms, such as the one shown in
Figure 1b, where the red- and blue-shaded areas indi-
cate the positive and negative magnetic polarities, re-
spectively, and where magnetic isocontours of ±50 G
are added with the same color convention. Magnetic
tongues are extensions of the leading and following mag-
netic polarities towards the center of the AR. In this ex-
ample, the positive polarity (red) extends northward in
the direction of the negative polarity (blue), while the
negative one has a similar southward extension towards
the positive. This pair of elongations are recurrently ob-
served in emerging ARs and are interpreted as due to
the emergence of a twisted FR (Poisson et al. 2020, and
references there in). Their presence naturally modiﬁes
the location of the magnetic barycenters.

3.3. Tilt Angles from the Core Field Fit Estimator

(CoFFE)

The CoFFE method is based on the identiﬁcation of
two diﬀerent magnetic ﬂux components that produce
the LOS magnetic ﬁeld distribution observed in emerg-
ing ARs (Poisson et al. 2020). These components are
noted as core and tongue ﬂuxes. We associate the core
ﬂux to the ﬂux of the axial ﬁeld of a toroidal FR dur-
ing its emergence (Poisson et al. 2020). The tongue ﬂux
is the magnetic ﬂux in the elongations of the magnetic
polarities, due to the FR azimuthal ﬁeld component, as
previously described. The core ﬂux is modeled using a
2D Gaussian.
Its ﬁt to the corresponding ﬁeld distri-
bution in the magnetogram provides the core center of
each polarity. Then, the tilt angle, φM
c , is computed us-
ing the core centers, as done when using the magnetic
barycenters.

More precisely, the CoFFE method performs simul-
taneously a ﬁt of the ﬁeld distribution of each polarity
with a Gaussian to isolate the core ﬁeld and removes
the tongue component of the ﬁeld distribution. To do
so an iterative procedure is designed. An initial ﬁt to
each polarity ﬂux provides a rough estimation of the
core centers. Then, an exclusion region is deﬁned. This
region is delimited with two lines perpendicular to the
line joining the core centers and crossing each of them
(see yellow lines in Figure 1b). This region is typically
located where the tongue contribution is dominant over
the core. So in the ﬁrst iteration, a new ﬁt of the core is
done removing the points in the exclusion region from
the ﬁtting procedure. Finally, iterations are performed
until a convergence criteria over φM
is fulﬁlled. In or-
c
der to improve the performance of the method a smaller
or larger exclusion region can be deﬁned (Poisson et al.
2020). For our aim, in this work, it is enough to use

6

Poisson et al.

tongues, and therefore, easier to identify and constrain.
Once the iteration procedure is completed for this mag-
netogram we use the obtained Gaussian parameters as
an initial guess for the ﬁt in the previous magnetogram
towards the beginning of the emergence. In this way a
progressive procedure is used in which the core parame-
ters computed at time step i + 1 are used to initiate the
computation at time step i.

An example of the application of CoFFE to a LOS
magnetogram of AR 9906 is shown in Figure 1b. The
black circles correspond to the isocontours of the Gaus-
sian function ﬁtted to the core ﬂux of each polarity. The
level of these contours is set to 50% of their respective
Gaussian maximum value. The red segment connecting
the center of the positive and negative core regions cor-
responds to the inclination of the bipole computed with
CoFFE, from which we derive the tilt φM
c . The black
segment corresponds to the tilt φM
a computed from the
magnetic barycenters, or apparent tilt. This segment
shows the shift of the magnetic barycenters towards the
center of the AR due to the presence of strong magnetic
tongues.

A series of tests on FR models and ARs have shown
that CoFFE provides a better estimation of the tilt an-
gle since it removes eﬃciently the eﬀect of the magnetic
tongues (Poisson et al. 2020). The correction achieved
with φM
requires just a little more computational ef-
c
fort than the previously described methods. Finally,
the removal of the eﬀect of the tongues allows us to ex-
pand the determination of AR tilts to the early stages of
their emergences, since magnetic tongues are typically
stronger at the beginning of the emergence (dominance
of the azimuthal ﬁeld component at the top of FR, Pois-
son et al. 2016).

4.1.1. ARs with Small and Weak Tongues

In this section, we show two examples of ARs with
small and weak (low magnetic ﬁeld intensity) tongues,
AR 11027 and AR 10879. Both ARs emerge in the
northern hemisphere in a low background ﬁeld region.
In these cases, tongues are visible only in the ﬁrst days
of the emergence and, sometimes, they are clear in only
one of the two main polarities.

Panels (a) and (b) in Figures 2 and 3 show snap-
shots of the evolution of AR 11027 and AR 10879, re-
spectively, as seen in WL images (panels a) and MDI
LOS magnetograms (panels b). The green segments
in panels (a) join the location of the leading and the
following umbra centers computed using the magnetic
ﬁeld polarity information for clustering. In both ﬁgures
the blue segments that join the umbra centers, com-
puted using the threshold method and k-means group-
ing, completely agree with the green segments (which
mask them). The black segments in panels (a) and
(b) of Figures 2 and 3 join the magnetic barycenters,
while the red segments in panels (b) connect the po-
larities core centers computed using CoFFE. The evo-
lution of these segments as the ARs emerge can be fol-
lowed in the WL (11027 WL.mp4 and 10879 WL.mp4)
and MDI LOS magnetogram (11027 CoFFE.mp4 and
10879 CoFFE.mp4) movies.

a and φM
c

Panels (c) in Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the evolution
of the four tilt-angle measurements described in Sec-
tion 3 and Table 1. For values derived using LOS mag-
netograms, the coincidence between φM
is evi-
dent in the associated movies, i.e. both black and red
continuous lines globally follow the same behavior. Fur-
thermore, the tilt values are in general positive which
agrees with Joy’s law. There are only a few negative
values of φM
in the early emergence of AR 10879 (Fig-
c
ure 3c) that are due to the disperse core ﬂux (its center
cannot be clearly determined when ﬁtting the Gaussian
function). φM
is more stable for this early emergence
a
phase (φM
a ≈ 0). Finally, AR 10879 is an example where
an intrinsic clockwise rotation of the bipole is well iden-
tiﬁed.

Concerning WL tilt-angle measurements for AR
11027, they closely agree (see the blue squares and green
dots in Figure 2c). Generally speaking, the four tilt val-
ues remain being close during all the emergence phase.
The same is true for AR 10879, except for several WL
tilt values (blue squares) as we explain in the next para-
graph.

Figure 3c shows several values of φWL

that are not
accompanied by the corresponding ones of φWLM
. For
these cases all umbra centers belong to same polarity
producing fake bipolar identiﬁcations from unipolar con-
ﬁgurations. The disperse ﬂux of the following polarity
forms weak umbrae which are not detected during a few
time intervals of the AR evolution, while umbrae are al-
ways present in the leading polarity. This implies that
WL tilt determinations should be limited to those ARs
in which the magnetic ﬂux density is large enough to
form umbrae in both polarities. This introduces a strong

bias in a large number of tilt-angle measurements that
only use WL data (Baranyi 2015).

4.1.2. ARs with Extended and Strong Tongues

We select AR 9906 and AR 9574 to illustrate the
inﬂuence of extended and strong (high magnetic ﬁeld
intensity) tongues on tilt-angle measurements. Both
ARs emerge in the southern solar hemisphere and have
tongues all along their emergence, even when reaching
their maximum magnetic ﬂux. In both cases the most
extended and strong tongue is the one of the leading
polarity.

Figure 1a,b and Figure 4a,b show snapshots of the
evolution of AR 9906 and AR 9574, respectively, as
seen in MDI WL (panels a) and LOS magnetograms
(panels b). Notice that in both cases tongues are so
strong that umbrae are present in WL images at these
elongated regions. The blue, green, black, and red seg-
ments in Figure 4a,b are equivalent to those deﬁned
in Figure 1a,b (see also Section 4.1.1). The evolu-
tion of these segments as the ARs emerge can be fol-
lowed in the WL (9906 WL.mp4 and 9574 WL.mp4)
and MDI LOS magnetogram (9906 CoFFE.mp4 and
9574 CoFFE.mp4) movies.

The black and red continuous lines in Figure 5a,b
show the evolution of the apparent tilt angle, φM
a (black
curve), and that derived using the core ﬂux centers, φM
c
(red curve) for AR 9906 (shown in Figure 1). Con-
versely, to what is observed in the case of ARs with small
and weak tongues, these values do not agree. On one
hand, φM
a stays always negative contrary to what is ex-
pected from Joy’ s law, and on the other hand a counter-
clockwise rotation of around 10◦ is present all along the
AR emergence. These two behaviors are induced by
the presence of the extended and strong tongues and,
as shown by the evolution of the red curve, they disap-
pear when φM
is computed using the CoFFE method.
c
The values of φM
stay close to 0◦ and their variation
c
do not indicate any clear bipole rotation along the AR
emergence.

In the case of AR 9574, the value of φM

a (black curve)
is positive during a short time at the beginning of the
emergence in agreement with Joy’s law (Figure 4c,d). It
then turns to be negative changing by about 14◦, imply-
ing a clockwise rotation of the bipole forming the AR.
This rotation changes to be counter-clockwise by ≈ 10◦
after the ﬁrst emergence day, returning to 0◦ by the end
of the emergence period. This behavior would imply
that the AR is formed by a ﬂux rope having ﬁrst a FR
axis with a negative writhe and later a positive one (see
e.g., L´opez Fuentes et al. 2003, for the link between tilt
rotation and writhe). However, the values of φM

always positive in agreement with Joy’s law and the evo-
lution of φM
implies a consistent clockwise rotation by
c
around 15◦. We conclude that magnetic tongues aﬀect
the determination of the tilt angle derived from LOS
magnetograms changing both its value and the rotation
direction of AR 9574.

The examples with extended and strong tongues give
us the chance to explore the inﬂuence of the grouping
algorithms in the case of using only WL observations.
Indeed, as shown in Figure 1a and Figure 4a, umbrae are
present at tongue locations aﬀecting the way algorithms
either based on proximity (k-means) or magnetic ﬁeld
grouping work.

The blue squares in Figure 5a depict the results de-
rived from the proximity algorithm used by SDD to
group umbrae, while the same symbols illustrate the
results for the threshold method and k-means group-
ing in Figure 5b. The grouping done using k-means as-
signs large umbra areas located on each of the magnetic
tongues to the opposite magnetic polarity group, see the
southern (northern) umbrae with magenta (green) con-
tours at the center of Figure 1a. The grouping algorithm

used by SDD also does a similar association. For both
grouping algorithms, the tilt results (blue squares) are
closer to those found with CoFFE, compare with the
red continuous line in Figure 5a,b. This means that, for
this AR and similar conﬁgurations, the grouping algo-
rithms remove eﬃciently the tongue eﬀect during most
of the emergence phase. This removal is less eﬃcient for
the k-means grouping than SDD at the beginning and
at the end of the emergence, when the blue squares get
closer to the green points in Figure 5b. In contrast, the
grouping made including the magnetic ﬁeld sign infor-
mation (green dots in both panels) gives values which
are strongly aﬀected by the tongues and, then, mostly
equivalent to the apparent tilt-angle values (black con-
tinuous line in both panels).

The tilt-angle correction, found for AR 9574 using
only the grouping procedures, cannot be generalized to
other cases, as shown by Figure 4c,d. The umbrae at
the locations of magnetic tongues are here properly as-
signed to their respective magnetic polarity sign by both
the SDD proximity algorithm and the k-means group-
ing. So, there is roughly no diﬀerence between the es-

global agreement shown in Figure 2c and Figure 3c of
the four tilt-angle values.

However, even for those simple ARs, tilt measure-
ments using WL data could be incorrect because one
of the AR polarities could have no umbra. This results
in WL tilt measurements done only on one magnetic po-
larity, which has no meaning. This happens mostly at
the beginning of the AR emergence, while it could be
also present later on. This problem should be solved
when measuring the tilt using LOS magnetograms.

Conversely, tilt measurements could be strongly mod-
iﬁed (up to ≈ 20◦) by magnetic tongues if they are
extended and strong. The examples in Section 4.1.2
show that magnetic tongues can have umbrae in WL.
This implies that tongues can aﬀect tilt-angle estima-
tions derived from WL data. Tongues also aﬀect the
tilt measurements derived from the computation of the
magnetic barycenters. This leads to false tilts, that can
even be in disagreement with the Joy’s law. Further-
more, these wrong determinations can as well lead to
infer a spurious rotation of the AR bipole, which can
even change of direction during the AR emergence. In
contrast, the CoFFE method successfully removes the
inﬂuence of magnetic tongues in the measurements of tilt
angles derived from LOS magnetograms. However, one
should bear in mind that for the CoFFE method to be
applicable and useful, one needs to have the emergence
evolution as complete as possible in order to identify
well the FR core at some point and proceed backwards
in time with the analysis.

We have illustrated the results just discussed using
four ARs with well-deﬁned tongue characteristics (see
Section 4.1.1 and Section 4.1.2). Still, AR emergences
have a broad range of tongue morphologies and evolu-
tions as shown by Poisson et al. (2016) in their study of
mainly bipolar ARs covering a full solar cycle. To get
a glance of this variety, we present in Appendix A the
results using two additional ARs. Our analysis shows
that the previous results are quite general, except that
the fake or biased deduced tilts could evolve in diﬀer-
ent ways according to the tongue evolution during the
AR emergence. However, CoFFE, in general, gives more
stable tilt values and, in particular, eliminates the spu-
rious bipole rotations inferred when using WL data or
the barycenter method applied to magnetograms.

as the umbra areas located at the tongues are as large

ues (black continuous curve in Figure 4c,d) while they
signiﬁcantly depart from the tilt values estimated with
CoFFE (red continuous curve in Figure 4c,d).

4.1.3. Summary of Bipolar ARs Characteristics

4.2. Multipolar ARs

ARs with small and weak tongues are the easiest to
analyze, since similar tilt values are expected to be ob-
tained using the four described methods, those derived
from LOS magnetograms (φM
a and φM
c ) and those from
WL images (φWL
). This is illustrated by the

all ARs are included despite being monopolar, bipolar or
multipolar. In this section, we test the diﬀerent meth-
ods summarized in Section 3 and apply them to multi-
polar ARs for which deﬁning a tilt angle is very diﬃcult.
We present two examples of ARs. In the ﬁrst case, AR
11007, a secondary bipole appears with a reverse polar-
ity sign between the main polarities of the ﬁrst emerged
bipole.
In the second case, AR 9748, ﬂux emergence
makes the distribution of the ﬂux in the tongues change
from displaying a positive twist-like pattern to a nega-
tive one.

Despite the disperse magnetic ﬂux and small concen-
trated polarities, AR 11007 has clear magnetic tongues
which are visible during the ﬁrst half of the emer-
gence. Towards its end, when tongues have almost
retracted, a delta group emerges between both polar-
ities (see Figure 6a,b, the LOS magnetogram movie,
11007 CoFFE.mp4, and WL movie, 11007 WL.mp4).

The values of φM

a (black continuous curve in Figure 6c)
are strongly aﬀected by the ﬂux in the tongues, as well as
by the presence of the central bipole from its early emer-
gence in the late hours of 1 November 2008 (at around
19:15 UT). The evolution of φM
shows two successive
a
rotations of the AR, ﬁrst clockwise and later counter-
clockwise. The second rotation is just a spurious eﬀect
due to the evolution of the central bipole and is not re-
lated either to the presence of tongues or the intrinsic
rotation of the main bipole. Next, close to the beginning
of the emergence, some φM
c measurements (red continu-
ous curve in Figure 6c, on 31 October 2008 from ≈ 04:45
UT to ≈ 12:45 UT) are aﬀected by the stronger ﬂux in
the tongue compared to that in the core of the following
polarity. This shifts the position of its Gaussian center
and provides lower φM
c values. After this period of time,
the CoFFE method provides a more stable tilt because
the exclusion region, deﬁned to remove the tongues, also
removes the emerging bipole around the AR center. Tilt
values derived from CoFFE agree with what is expected
from Joy’s law and indicate no clear rotation of the main
bipole.

AR 11007 provides the opportunity to illustrate sev-
eral problems of tilt-angle measurements using WL data.
From the ﬁrst four measurements (see blue squares and
green dots in Figure 6c and the evolution in movie
11007 WL.mp4) only the ﬁrst one corresponds to cor-
rect groupings either using k-means or polarity signs.
The other three measurements have a wrong bipole de-
termination, and even a monopolar region is present for
the middle one. These type of problems were already en-
countered in Section 4.1.1 and Appendix A. After that,
none of the two polarities have detectable umbrae (no-
tice the large gap in the WL data) until the ﬁeld inten-

sity in the leading polarity is enough to produce umbrae,
while this is not the case for the disperse following polar-
ity. This happens at around 2 November at 03:10 UT.
Then, the umbra group center of the preceding nega-
tive polarity of the main bipole is falsely associated to
the single positive umbra of the new bipole. This hap-
pens up to the end of the emergence resulting in wrong
estimations of φWL

(Figure 6c).

Six snapshots of the evolution of AR 9748, two WL
images and four MDI magnetograms, are shown in Fig-
ure 7. The AR is clearly bipolar in its early emer-
gence with elongated and weak tongues. The tongue
ﬂux, mainly the one of the preceding polarity, is frag-
mented in the ﬁrst stages of the emergence. By the
second half of 21 December, a secondary bipole emerges

ginning of the AR emergence the distribution of the
ﬂux in the tongues indicates a positively twisted FR;
but by mid 22 December, the ﬂux distribution is rather

compatible with a negatively twisted FR. This appar-
ent change in the FR twist is produced by false tongues
due to new ﬂux emergence (compare panels c and e of

at around 22 December at ≈ 21:00 UT, when a positive
polarity starts distorting the shape of the negative elon-
gated false tongue (see panel f and the LOS magnetic
ﬁeld movie 9748 CoFFE.mp4) and a negative polarity
appears later to its east. The ﬂux in the third bipole
is lower than in the second one and does not alter the
evolution of the total unsigned magnetic ﬂux (positive
ﬂux plus absolute value of the negative one divided by 2)
shown in panel (h). It is, however, noteworthy that the
clear alignment between the direction of tongues (orig-
inal and false) with that of the core, would have made
this AR to be considered by any tilt-angle computation
algorithm as a single FR, at almost any time of its emer-
gence, if observations at only one time would have been
analyzed.

The four tilt estimations for AR 9748 are shown in
Figure 7g. The values of φM
a (black continuous curve)
are positive as expected from Joy’s law but its varia-
tion changes from increasing values to decreasing ones
by 22 December at ≈ 17:30 UT, close to the time when
the distribution of the tongue ﬂux changes from positive
to apparent negative twist. This change indicates ﬁrst a
counter-clockwise rotation and later a clockwise one. As
in the other examples, CoFFE shows more stable esti-
mation until the end of 24 December, which agree with
Joy’s law (red continuous line in Figure 7g). The change
of position of the preceding polarity core observed dur-
ing the last day (seen approximately during 2001-12-24
20:00 UT to 2001-12-25 24:00 UT in 9748 CoFFE.mp4)
is due to the increase of the ﬂux of the second emergence,
aﬀecting also the value of φM
In fact, the correction

provided by CoFFE is aﬀected both by the spatial loca-
tion and the ﬂux of the secondary bipole relative to the
ﬁrst bipole.

, around the end of 21 December
and beginning of 22 December, when the tongue um-
brae are present in the ﬁrst bipole (see the WL movie
9748 WL.mp4). The morphology of the tongues forces
a wrong grouping in the case of φWL
U , this is somehow
corrected when including the polarity sign and φWLM
becomes closer to φM
a . After the second bipole emer-
gence both measurements are closer to the red curve
corresponding to φM
c , indicating that the ﬂux in the core
produces the largest umbrae.

From the two examples described in this section, in the
ﬁrst one, AR 11007, we observe a clear new emergence in
between the polarities of the ﬁrst emerging bipole. This
emergence produces a false rotation of the original bipole
when measuring tilt values from LOS magnetograms us-
ing the magnetic barycenters, as well as wrong tilt values

when using WL data. The second example, AR 9748,
illustrates how a secondary ﬂux emergence with spe-
ciﬁc characteristics can somehow trick algorithms used
to compute tilt angles both from LOS magnetograms
and WL data, i.e. all of them would have considered
in this case the emergence of a single FR at any time.
This secondary emergence also produces a false rota-
tion of the AR main bipole. However, even if deceived
by both ARs, CoFFE ﬁnds more stable and coherent
results during most of the AR emergence since it com-
putes tilt values using only the ﬂux in the core centers
(excluding most of the tongue and new emerging ﬂux).

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The correct determination of the tilt angle of active
regions (ARs) is fundamental to understand the un-
derlying processes that take place during the transit
of magnetic ﬂux ropes (FRs) through the convection
zone. Moreover, ﬂux-transport dynamo models rely on
the precise estimation of the latitudinal dependence of
the tilt angle, known as Joy’s law, to predict the pas-
sage from one solar cycle to the next (see Bhowmik &
Nandy 2018; Cameron et al. 2010). Tilt-angle values,
and consequently Joy’s law, have shown signiﬁcant vari-
ation and dispersion depending both on the observable
and the method used to measure them.
In this arti-
cle, we test four diﬀerent methods to measure AR tilts.
We also explore the implications on the measured tilt
of typical characteristics of ﬂux emergence, namely the
evolution of magnetic tongues and the emergence of sec-
ondary bipoles.

A standard method is to use line-of-sight (LOS) mag-
netograms, and to compute the tilt angle, φM
a , from
the ﬂux-weighted centers (or magnetic barycenters) of
the magnetic polarities (Section 3.2). However, Pois-
son et al. (2016) have shown that the elongation of the
polarities produced by the magnetic tongues can aﬀect
signiﬁcantly the position of magnetic barycenters dur-
ing the emergence of ARs and, consequently, the value
of φM
a . In Section 4.1.2 we have shown that the magnetic
tongues can produce spurious rotations of the AR bipole
and values of φM
a which oppose to Joy’s law. Therefore,
these measurements can contribute to increase the dis-
persion found in statistical studies of Joy’s law in which
the stage of the AR evolution is not taken into account.
The earliest and largest databases used to compute
tilt-angle values are those based on WL images. Then,
these databases have been the ones mostly used in sta-
tistical studies of Joy’s law (Howard et al. 1990; Baranyi
2015; Wang et al. 2015). Tilt values obtained from WL
data depend, ﬁrst, on the method to identify umbra ar-
eas, and second, on the algorithm used to assign each

14

Poisson et al.

umbra to the corresponding magnetic polarity (see Sec-
tion 3.1). We ﬁnd that the tilt values, φWL
U , derived us-
ing from SOHO WL images in SDD (Gy˝ori et al. 2010)
could diﬀer from those derived by us using the k-means
clustering method (e.g., Figures 4 and 5). Furthermore,
as recognized before (Baranyi 2015), the WL data in-
clude ARs which have all their spots with the same
magnetic polarity. Then, in these unipolar regions, any
clustering algorithm deﬁne wrongly a tilt angle. This
implies a strong bias on ARs which are in their early
stage of emergence and/or posses low magnetic ﬂux.

U

The above problems of φWL

U can be detected using the
information of the magnetic ﬁeld sign to properly group
the umbrae and obtain values that we call φWLM
. How-
ever, the use of WL data cannot guarantee that the eﬀect
of the magnetic tongues is removed, since in some ARs
we found that the ﬂux associated to the tongues can still
produce large umbrae (e.g., Figure 1). Therefore, WL
tilt values have the same problems as φM
a in ARs with
strong magnetic tongues independently of the grouping
algorithm used (e.g., Figures 4 and 5). All these imply
that the most common methods used to compute tilts
cannot, in general, give precise estimations of tilt angles
in young ARs.

In Poisson et al. (2020) we developed a method, called
Core Field Fit Estimator (CoFFE), based on the identi-
ﬁcation of the LOS ﬁeld distribution and designed to iso-
late the axial ﬁeld of the emerging FR (i.e. the core ﬂux).
This method allows us to eliminate the eﬀect of mag-
netic tongues on tilt measurements, as well as the pres-
ence of secondary emergences, then to obtain corrected
tilt values, called φM
(Section 3.3). We test the con-
c
sistency of φM
in cases where the magnetic tongues are
c
weak (low magnetic ﬂux) and, for bipolar ARs we ﬁnd
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the values achieved
with the other three methods (Figures 2 and 3 in Sec-
tion 4.1.1).
In cases where the tongues are strong we
ﬁnd that CoFFE eﬀectively reduces the ﬂux associated
to the magnetic tongues from the tilt estimation remov-
ing the spurious rotation of the bipole, as well as the
deviation of the tilt from Joy’s law predictions (Figs. 4,
5 and 8).

We compare the performance of CoFFE with the stan-
dard methods to estimate the tilt angle for the particu-
lar cases of multipolar ARs. Although the tilt angle is
only deﬁned for ARs formed by the emergence of a single
FR, most of the statistical studies use standard methods
without considering the AR characteristics, which may
lead to a larger dispersion of tilt angle values and/or
inconsistent results. The CoFFE method can still es-
timate the tilt angle of the main bipole in regions with
multiple emergences, provided that these emergences are

located within the main AR bipole, i.e. in the band de-
ﬁned between the main bipole polarities that is excluded
by CoFFE by method design (to minimize the eﬀects of
magnetic tongues). Presently, we cannot generalize the
application of CoFFE to all multipolar ARs, since the
correction achieved depends on the spatial location and
the ﬂux strength of the secondary emergences. Never-
theless, we ﬁnd that for the analyzed ARs CoFFE signif-
icantly reduces the eﬀect of secondary ﬂux emergences
on φM
c (see Section 4.2). This implies that CoFFE can be
used to improve the estimation of the tilt angle in stud-
ies using large samples with statistical purposes. In fact,
in order to treat more correctly multipolar ARs, CoFFE
will need to be improved to include an algorithm which
ﬁrst identiﬁes, and then separates, diﬀerent emerging
bipoles in a similar way as done by Leka et al. (1996).
ARs formed by a series of signiﬁcant emergences will
ultimately have tilt angles associated to each identiﬁed
bipole.

Summarizing, the aforementioned standard methods,
using either WL data or LOS magnetograms or a com-
bination of both, to measure tilt angles strongly depend
on the stage of the AR evolution, being the presence
of magnetic tongues the main problem that aﬀects tilt-
angle estimations, during the emerging phase. That is
why CoFFE is designed to correct their eﬀect. However,
to correctly apply CoFFE, we need at least one magne-
togram along the AR evolution in which the core region
can be detected and isolated from the tongues in both
polarities. Therefore, each AR has to be treated individ-
ually if we want to extend the computation of tilt angles
as far as the early stages of the AR emergence. This
more involved treatment of the data somehow reduces
the applicability of the method in automatic procedures
that deal with a large number of cases. Despite this
limitation, we still ﬁnd that CoFFE is the only method
giving the most precise tilt-angle values during an AR
evolution. This further allow to study how emerging
ARs are rotating and to further study its physical ori-
gin (e.g., due to the writhe of the FR axis or to the
action of a convective vortex). This will extend pre-
vious studies done on the long-term evolution of ARs
(e.g., L´opez Fuentes et al. 2003) to the emerging phase,
with the potential to reveal more information on the
sub-photospheric FRs.

APPENDIX

A. A VARIETY OF TONGUE MORPHOLOGIES AND EVOLUTIONS

Poisson et al. (2016) studied the characteristics of magnetic tongues for 149 bipolar ARs observed along a full solar
cycle. Though, in general, tongues have a tendency to be stronger at the start of the emergence and become weaker
as the magnetic ﬂux of the AR reaches its maximum, there are many cases in which tongues stay strong and extended
even at the time of maximum ﬂux (see the examples in Section 4.1.2). Furthermore, observed tongues present a large
variety of morphologies and evolutions, even appearing at any stage of an AR emergence. This large variety could
be only reproduced when using a broad range of twist proﬁles when comparing the data with the emergence of a
twisted FR. This is shown in Figure 10 of Poisson et al. (2016) where observations are compared with the results of
FR models with varying radial and azimuthal twist proﬁles. In this section we discuss two examples in which tongues
evolve diﬀerently; they appear, develop, and almost disappear in AR 10268, while they are mostly present and very
elongated during the full evolution of AR 8760.

AR 10268, which emerges in the northern hemisphere, has a clear bipolar conﬁguration in which tongues are strong
and do not appear clearly separated from the core ﬂux (see the LOS magnetic ﬁeld movie 10268 CoFFE.mp4). The
eﬀect of tongues is evident when comparing the black and red curves in Figure 8a. The black curve, φM
a , shows that
AR 10268 evolves as it emerges towards a high tilt value that opposes to Joys law (φM
a < 0), while by the beginning
of 23 January 2003 there is a sudden change in the apparent bipole rotation towards tilt values agreeing with this
a > 0). This variation implies that the bipole would ﬁrst rotate counter-clockwise by around 20◦ and later
law (φM
clockwise by around 45◦. A diﬀerent tilt evolution is shown by the red curve depicting the values of φM
c computed
with CoFFE. In this case, most values agree with what is expected from Joy’s law and the evolution of the corrected
tilt angle indicates a consistent clockwise rotation of ≈ 20◦. Summarizing, in this AR we observe a typical behavior
of the tongues, i.e. they appear in the ﬁrst stages of the emergence, evolve, and almost disappear by its end; this is
shown by the coincidence between φM

a and φM
c
Concerning tilts derived from WL data, Figure 8a shows that the blue squares, φWL

U , and the green dots, φWLM
,
are quite scattered and do not clearly follow either the black or red curves. In this AR, tongues are so strong that
they have umbrae and they aﬀect the WL tilt measurements. Next, we observe four wrong φWL
U values derived from
unipolar umbra measurements (as in the case of AR 10879, Figure 3). After the beginning of 23 January both, φWL
and φWLM
, follow roughly the evolution of φM
a until the time when tongues start retracting on 24 January. By this
time, both WL measurements follow the evolution of φM
c . Finally, at the end of the emergence all four tilt values agree
(see the WL movie 10268 WL.mp4).

AR 8760 emerges in the northern solar hemisphere. This is a mainly bipolar AR which shows a series of minor
emergences in between the two main bipole polarities almost all along the period of time shown in Figure 8b (see
the movie 9760 CoFFE.mp4). These minor bipoles can be intepreted as the resistive emergence of an undulatory
FR in which the upper part is fragmented by a Parker instabiliy and then reformed by magnetic reconnection at
the photospheric layer (Pariat et al. 2004; Cheung et al. 2010). Despite its complex evolution, these minor bipoles
do not aﬀect much tilt-angle measurements. At the beginning of the emergence tongues are not clearly visible due
to the presence of a secondary bipole. Next, by 8 November 1999 at ≈ 19:10 UT a clear elongated tongue pattern,
a and φM
corresponding to a negatively twisted FR, is present. After a fast increase, a comparable evolution of φM
c
(clockwise rotation) is present. The largest diﬀerence, of around 5◦ in φM
a , is evident at ≈ 14:25 UT on
9 November. By the beginning of 11 November, tongues are smaller and weaker, though still present.
It is this
distribution of the ﬂux what now makes both φM
a and φM
follow the same behavior until the end of the period shown
c
in Figure 8b. The values of the tilt angles derived from magnetograms agree with what is expected from Joy’s law.

Umbrae are present in the core regions as well as in the tongues once they become clearly visible (see the WL movie,
U and φWLM
8760 WL.mp4, notice also that there are several gaps in these data). The blue squares and green dots, φWL
,
follow the increase in tilt-angle values as φM
c in Figure 8b. At around the time of the largest diﬀerence between
φM
a and φM
c , ≈ 14:25 UT on 9 November, umbrae are very disperse and the k-means algorithm fails to group them
correctly locating some of them on the wrong polarity region giving the largest diﬀerence between the blue squares
and green dots. This failure has in fact a positive eﬀect since it decreases the eﬀect of the tongues, as in AR 9906
(Figure 5), then φWL
c at that time. After a gap in the WL data,

U values are closer to the red continuous curve of φM

Figure 8. Evolution of the tilt angles along the emergence of (a) AR 10268 and (b) AR 8760, both located in the northern
hemisphere. The black and red continuous lines, as well as the blue squares and green dots, have the same meaning as those in
Figure 2c. Movies of these AR evolutions are available as additional material (10268 WL.mp4, 10268 CoFFE.mp4, 8760 WL.mp4
and 8760 CoFFE.mp4).

ending at around the beginning of 10 November, both WL measurements follow the same behavior with diﬀerences
between them of less than 5◦. The largest diﬀerences happen when k-means clustering groups umbrae located in the
wrong polarity sign region. Later on both WL tilt values, φWL
, stay closer to the black continuous line
corresponding to φM

a , showing again the eﬀect of magnetic tongues.

This section shows how diverse, both in morphology and evolution, tongues can be. In AR 10268 tongues are strong
enough at the start of the emergence to aﬀect the apparent tilt evolution as well as measurements using WL data.
It is only when they start to retract that a fair agreement of the four tilt-angle values is observed. In the second
example, AR 8760, tongues are present all along the emergence with a varying intensity. WL measurements are clearly
aﬀected by the dispersion of the umbrae that are present both in the core and tongue regions. Despite some diﬀerences
between φWL
, mainly caused by a wrong grouping, they follow in general the tilt values given by the
magnetic barycenters method.
