ABSTRACT
Optical spectra of the 2006 outburst of RS Ophiuchi beginning one day after discovery to
over a year after the outburst are presented here. The spectral evolution is found to be similar
to that in previous outbursts. The early phase spectra are dominated by hydrogen and helium
(I & II) lines. Coronal and nebular lines appear in the later phases. Emission line widths
are found to narrow with time, which is interpreted as a shock expanding into the red giant
wind. Using the photoionisation code CLOUDY, spectra at nine epochs spanning 14 months
after the outburst peak, thus covering a broad range of ionisation and excitation levels in
the ejecta, are modelled. The best-ﬁt model parameters indicate the presence of a hot white
dwarf source with a roughly constant luminosity of 1.26 × 1037 erg s−1. During ﬁrst three
months, the abundances (by number) of He, N, O, Ne, Ar, Fe, Ca, S and Ni are found above
solar abundances; abundances of these elements decreased in the later phase. Also presented
are spectra obtained during quiescence. Photoionisation model of the quiescence spectrum
indicates the presence of a low luminosity accretion disk. The helium abundance is found to
be subsolar at quiescence.

1 INTRODUCTION

RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) is a recurrent nova that has had nova out-
bursts in 1898, 1933, 1958, 1967 and 1985 (Rosino 1987), with
possible outbursts in 1907 (Schaeffer 2004) and 1945 (Oppen-
heimer & Mattei 1993). It is a fast nova with t3 = 8 − 10 days, and
the optical spectrum is characterized by strong coronal and other
high excitation lines that reach a peak around 60 days after maxi-
mum (e.g. Rosino 1987; Anupama & Prabhu 1989). The outbursts
occur due to thermonuclear runaway (TNR) on a massive white
dwarf (WD) surface that has accreted matter from its red giant
companion star (Starrﬁeld et al. 1985; Yaron et al. 2005). The fast-
moving nova ejecta interact with the slow-moving red giant wind,
leading to the formation of shocks (Bode & Kahn 1985, O’Brien
and Kahn 1987). This leads to the formation of coronal lines, and
also the narrowing of the emission lines (e.g. Gorbatskii 1972,
1973; Snijders 1987; Anupama & Prabhu 1989; Shore et al. 1996).
There is a remarkable similarity between the optical light curves
and spectra from different outbursts (Rosino 1987). So far, the 1985

outburst was one of the best studied events, being recorded from X-
rays to radio wavelengths (Bode 1987 and references therein).

The sixth recorded outburst of the recurrent nova RS Oph was
discovered on 2006 February 12.83 (Narumi et. al., 2006). It of-
fered another chance for multiwavelength observations, and has
been studied in detail at several wavelength regimes; e.g. in X-
rays (e.g. Bode et al. 2006; Sokoloski et al. 2006), in the optical
(Buil 2006; Fujii 2006; Iijima 2006; Skopal et al. 2008), in the in-
frared (IR) (e.g. Das et al. 2006; Banerjee et al. 2009; Monnier et
al. 2006; Evans et al. 2007) and in the radio (e.g. O’Brien et al.
2006; Kantharia et al. 2007; Rupen et al. 2008). The X-ray results
clearly detect an X-ray blast wave that expands into the red giant
wind. The temporal evolution of the shock wave was traced from
XRT observations from the Swift satellite (Bode et al. 2006) and
the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations (Sokoloski
et al. 2006). A similar shock has been detected from the evolution
of the line widths in the near-IR spectra of the 2006 outburst (Das et
al. 2006). The 2006 outburst also showed similarity to the previous
outburst, with some differences, especially in the X-rays and radio.
In this paper, we present the evolution of the optical spectrum
of RS Oph during 14 months following the 2006 outburst based
on spectra obtained using the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope

 
 
 
 
 
 
2 Mondal et al.

(HCT), Hanle, India and the 2.3m Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT),
Kavalur, India. We have also modelled the observed spectra with
the photoionisation code CLOUDY. From the best ﬁt spectra, we
have estimated physical parameters such as luminosity, tempera-
ture, elemental abundances etc. associated with the RS Oph system.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The observations of RS Oph began on 2006 February 13, one day
after the outburst discovery and continued well after the nova had
reached quiescence. Low resolution spectra were obtained using
the HCT and occasionally with the VBT, while high resolution
(R∼ 30, 000) spectra were obtained with the VBT in the immediate
post-maximum phase (14 and 19 February 2006). The HCT spec-
tra were obtained using the Himalaya Faint Object Spectrograph
Camera (HFOSC) through Grism #7 (R∼ 1500) and Grism #8
(R∼ 2200), covering the wavelength ranges of 3400-8000 ˚A and
5200-9200 ˚A respectively. The high resolution VBT spectra were
obtained covering the wavelength ranges of 4000 - 8000 ˚A using
the ﬁber-fed Echelle spectrograph. Table 1 gives the dates of
observations. We adopt the date of maximum as 2006 February
12.83 (JD 2453779.330).

All spectra were reduced in the standard manner using the
various tasks under the IRAF package. The spectra were bias sub-
tracted, ﬂat ﬁeld corrected and the spectrum extracted using the
optimal extraction method. The HFOSC spectra were calibrated us-
ing the FeAr calibration source for the blue region, and FeNe cali-
bration source for the red region. Spectroscopic standards obtained
during the same night were used for instrumental response correc-
tion. The blue and the red spectra of the same night were combined
and spectra obtained on a relative ﬂux scale, which were then ﬂux
calibrated using the photometric magnitudes published in the litera-
ture. All spectra were then de-reddened using E(B−V ) = 0.71. The
VBT Echelle spectra were wavelength calibrated using the ThAr
source. These spectra are not ﬂux calibrated.

3 EVOLUTION OF THE OPTICAL SPECTRUM

3.1 The early phase : days 1 to 15

One day after the maximum, the spectrum is dominated by broad
emission lines due to H, N, Ca II (IR), Na I and O I. Weak P Cygni
absorption features are seen associated with the emission lines.
The nova appears to be in the “ﬁreball expansion” phase. About
5 days after maximum, P Cyg absorption features associated with
the broad emission are absent and the emission line widths are nar-
rower. The continuum appears bluer. The prominent lines are due
to H and Fe II. [Ar X] 5535 line could be weakly present. The
strength of O I 8446 line has increased while the strength of Ca II
IR lines has decreased. [Fe X] 6374 begins to appear around day 8.
Sharp [O III] 4959, 5007, [N II] 5755 appear around day 15. [Fe
XI] is probably present on day 15. These lines most probably arise
from the ionised red giant wind. In the spectra of days 14-16, the
He I lines show a double peaked proﬁle. The spectra are shown in
Figures 1 and 2.

RS Oph was detected in the 14-25 keV band of Swift XRT
and in the 3-5 keV and 5-12 keV bands of the RXTE all sky moni-
tor during ∼ 0 − 5 days, with an increasing ﬂux (Bode et al. 2006,
Sokoloski et al. 2006). The presence of the coronal lines in the op-
tical spectrum during the very early phase appears to be consistent

with the hard X-ray detection. The increase in the blue continuum
is also consistent with the increase in the X-ray ﬂux.

The high resolution spectra of day 1 show sharp, narrow P
Cygni emission features superimposed over the broad emission fea-
tures (see Figure 3). The P Cyg absorption, which originates in the
circumstellar red giant wind indicates a velocity ∼ 20 km s−1. The
absorption decreased in strength around day 7, similar to the broad
absorption component. The wind emission is dominated by Fe II
emission lines. The spectra clearly show the Na ID interstellar ab-
sorption components as well as several diffuse interstellar bands
between 5690 ˚A and 5870 ˚A at 5705, 5778, 5780, 5797, 5844 and
5849 ˚A (Josafatsson & Snow 1987). Of these, the narrow bands at
5780, 5797 and 5849 ˚A are correlated with interstellar reddening.
Using the average of the 5797 ˚A narrow band equivalent width of
0.109 ± 0.01 ˚A, an E(B −V ) = 0.75 ± 0.05 is estimated.

3.2 The high excitation phase : days 16 to 80

This phase is marked by a decrease in the strength of the permitted
lines, and the strengthening of high excitation lines. The Fe II lines
fade, while the He I lines develop and strengthen with time, and by
∼ day 25, the spectrum is dominated by H and He (I & II) lines
(Figure 4). Also, O I 8446 becomes stronger than O I 7774. The
emergence of the He II lines is consistent with the onset of the
supersoft X-ray phase (SSS phase) that commenced about 30 days
since outburst (Osborne et al. 2011). Although a few coronal lines
began developing as early as day 8, the onset of the coronal phase

appears to be around day 25, with all the coronal lines, due to [Fe
X], [Fe XI] and [Fe XIV] strongly present, and strengthening with
time. The coronal phase peaks around 60-70 days after maximum,
similar to the previous outbursts (Anupama & Prabhu 1989).

The line proﬁles show multiple components. The width of the
emission lines continues to decrease with time. At around after 70
days, [O III] line width becomes similar to those of other lines,
and the spectrum is dominated by Balmer, He II, coronal and other

high excitation lines. O I 8446 shows a two component – a broad
and a narrow component – structure. By day 80, the [O III] lines
are strengthening, and the O I 8446 ˚A two component structure
continues. The spectra are shown in Figure 5.

of the nebular lines. Contribution from the giant secondary is seen
by day 140, as indicated by the presence of TiO absorption bands.
These spectra can be seen in Figure 6.

4 DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMISSION LINES

4.1 Emission line velocities

The emission line widths are found to narrow with time. The hy-
drogen Balme lines indicate the following velocities: 4200 km s−1
(+1d); 3800 km s−1 (+3d); 2000 km s−1 (+5d); 1060 km s−1
(+18d); 740 km s−1 (+31d); 332 km s−1 (+70d). Figure 7 shows
the evolution of the emission line velocity. The velocities vary as
t−0.4 for t < 5 days and t−0.66 during t = 5 − 70 days. This phe-
nomenon is seen in the near-infrared lines as well and has been
generally interpreted as free expansion of the shock front during the
ﬁrst four days and a deceleration phase thereafter (Das et al. 2006
and Banerjee et al.2009). These ﬁndings are also consistent with
the X-ray observations (Bode et al. 2006, Sokoloski et al. 2006).

A slight increase in the emission line width of the recombina-
tion lines is seen after day 80. The nebular lines are broader than
recombination lines, with a velocity v ∼ 1500 km s−1 compared to
v ∼ 400 km s−1 for the recombination lines.

3.3 The nebular phase : beyond day 100

4.2 Oxygen lines

The nebular phase began by day 100, and the nova was well into
the nebular phase by ∼ 135 days. The nebular lines are broader
compared to the recombination lines. Coronal lines have weakened
in strength. Other nebular lines such as [Ca II] 7323 begin to appear.
Fe II and N I lines are absent or very weak. The nebular lines get
stronger between days 140–160 and are broader than other lines.
Hα shows asymmetric broad wings, with a velocity similar to those

The O I 8446 ˚A line is stronger than the 7774 ˚A line on all days
implying that Lyβ ﬂuorescence is the dominant excitation mech-
anism. The evolution of these two lines can be seen in Figures 8
and 9. The [O I] 6300 and 6364 lines are best seen in spectra start-
ing 2006 May. The O IV 6106 and 6182 lines are seen from 2006
March 10 onwards and are clearly identiﬁable till 2006 July. There
is a hint of the [O III] 4363 line in the spectra obtained from 2006

Dates are in the dd/mm format. The stronger line in all the panels is the O

2006 May 3.

Dates are in the dd/mm format. Spectra in the last two columns in the ﬁrst
three rows have been scaled up for clarity. The strong line in the ﬁrst panel
(top left) is Hγ. The 4363 ˚A line starts affecting the blue wing of Hγ from
2006 March 16, and is clearly seen on 2006 April 1; it has almost disap-
peared by 2006 October 17.

Dates are in the dd/mm format. The stronger line in the ﬁrst panel (top left)

another unidentiﬁed line at 7785 ˚A can be seen (second panel from top).
The O I line is seen to fade away in 2006 July, reappear in 2006 August and
persist until 2006 October.

February 21 onwards. It is clearly seen on 2006 April 1. On 2006
May 26 it is seen to be as strong as Hγ. It faded thereafter, but is
seen till 2006 August 18. There is no sign of this line in the 2006
October 17 spectrum. The evolution of this line can be seen in Fig-
ure 10. Similarly, there are indications of the [O III] 4959 and 5007
lines from 2006 February 20 onwards. They are clearly seen on
2006 April 1, become extremely broad on 2006 May 26, are very
prominent on 2006 July 4, and fade thereafter. The evolution of
these lines can be seen in Figure 11.

4.3 Helium lines

There is only a hint of the He I 4471 ˚A line on 2006 February
13; it shows up clearly two days later. The 5876 ˚A line is very
broad with a sharp central absorption on 2006 February 13. It has
contributions from some other line on its redward side till 2006
April. On 2006 February 13, the 6678 ˚A line is very broad with
a central absorption, which persists until early 2006 March. The
7065 ˚A line shows a central absorption on 2006 February 13 which
shifts to the redward side on subsequent days. By 2006 March 16,
the line has a Gaussian-like appearance. All the He I lines persist
until 2006 October 17; the 7065 ˚A line shows a P-Cygni proﬁle
from 2006 July onwards (see Figure 12). The He II 4686 ˚A line
appears on 2006 February 27 with a narrower FWHM than Balmer
lines; emission lines at this position in earlier spectra are likely to
be contributions from Fe II. By 2006 March 10, its width is similar
to Hβ. This line persists until 2006 October 17 (see Figure 13).

4.4 Nitrogen lines

The [N II] 5755 ˚A line is present since 13 Feb. It is very broad
initially but narrows down by 15 February. The 5660 ˚A appears on

strengthen with time. By 2006 March 16, He I (the ﬁrst two lines) has
strengthened; the third (broad) line is mostly Si II. The [O III] 5007 line
can be seen feebly on the blueward side of the He I 5016 line. The [O III]
4959 and 5007 lines can be clearly seen in the spectrum obtained on 2006
May 3; they persist until 2006 October 17.

16 February and is broad, blended with the 5680 ˚A feature. From
20 February onwards it has a narrow component on top of a broad
feature. Other nitrogen lines show up after 26 February. The 5755
˚A line has a triangular shape and is seen to narrow with time. It
suddenly broadens on 26 May. This line persists until 2006 October
17 (See Figure 14). The ‘4640’ complex is observed from 2006
February to 2006 October (see Figure 13).

4.5 Coronal lines

Coronal lines in RS Oph were ﬁrst seen and identiﬁed by Adams
& Joy (1933) on day 51 during the 1933 outburst. The presence of
ﬁve coronal lines at 3987, 4086, 4231, 5303 and 6374 ˚A could be
well-established on their spectrograms obtained on later nights. In
this outburst, coronal lines of neon ([Ne III], [Ne V]), argon ([Ar
IV], [Ar X], [Ar XI], [Ar XIV]) and iron ([Fe VII], [Fe X], [Fe
XI], [Fe XIV]) can be clearly seen in the spectra obtained during
2006 March – June. It appears that the calcium lines showed an un-
usual behaviour during this outburst as compared to the previous
outbursts. [Ca XIII] 4086 ˚A was absent, [Ca XV] 5694 ˚A was not
prominent. The temporal development of the iron green and red
coronal lines are shown in Figures 15 and 16 respectively. Many
coronal lines are close in wavelength to other permitted or low ion-
isation lines – for example, [Ne III] 3970 ˚A and Hε, [Ni XII] 4231
˚A and Fe II, [Ar XIV] 4412 and [Fe II], etc – and it becomes dif-
ﬁcult to separate the contributions from the individual components
from observations of emission lines. However, it is very likely that
the permitted or low ionisation lines are the dominant contributors
in the early outburst spectra.

4.6 The Raman scattered 6830, 7088 ˚A lines

The strong line at 6830 ˚A which was ﬁrst seen in the 1933 outburst
was attributed to [Kr III] (Joy & Swings 1945). This line was seen

line shows as a small kink on the redward side of 5755 on 2006 March 16,
become stronger and fades away by 2006 August 18.

Dates are in the dd/mm format. The broad lines seen in the ﬁrst panel (top

2006 March 10. The [O I] 6300 line is also feebly seen on this day. By 2006
August 18, only the [O I] 6300 and 6363 lines are clearly seen.

in other outbursts also. We now know that this emission feature,
seen in many symbiotic stars, is due to the Raman scattering of the
O VI 1032 ˚A line by neutral hydrogen (Schmid 1989). Schmid also
noted that in some symbiotic stars a fainter companion feature ap-
pears at 7088 ˚A. This is due to the same process as for the 1038 ˚A
line of the O VI resonance doublet. Schmid has suggested that this
Raman scattering in symbiotic stars takes place in the atmosphere
of the cool giant and in the inner parts of its stellar wind. The pres-
ence of the Raman scattered O VI lines implies the existence of
a hot ionising source, the WD on which hydrogen is still burning
after the outburst. The 2006 outburst is the ﬁrst one since this iden-
tiﬁcation was done. This line is ﬁrst seen in our spectrum of 2006
March 10 and persists until 2006 August 18. In our next spectrum
obtained on 2006 October 17, this line is probably not seen; other
nearby lines dominate this wavelength region (see Figure 17). The
7088 line is also feebly seen in the wings of He I 7065 ˚A during the
same period.

4.7 Formation of the spectral lines

Swift observations have revealed the existence of a supersoft X-ray
phase during days 26–90 of the outburst which is due to the matter
burning quiescently on the WD (Osborne et. al. 2011). This source
peaks at around day 50, similar to the behaviour of the coronal
lines. This indicates that some of the ﬂux in the coronal lines, espe-
cially during days 26–90, must be due to photoionisation. As men-
tioned in Section 4.6, the behaviour of the Raman lines also cor-
roborate this idea. The He II and O IV lines having high ionisation
potentials also were strong during 2006 March – June. Similarly,
multi-frequency radio data show that the spectral index is consistent
with a mixed non-thermal and thermal emission during days 5–60
(Eyres et. al., 2009). Therefore, as for other novae, optical spectra
should show the characteristics of photoionised ejecta. Photoioni-

and barely seen by 2006 June 1. The last row of spectra display just the
ﬂuctuations at the continuum level.

2006 March 10; there is no gradual strengthening as seen for other lines. It
disappears after 2006 July 19. The [Ar XI] 6919 line is seen during 2006
March 16 to 2006 May 3.

sation could even be the dominant mechanism at least during days
29–90. So, in Section 5, we attempt the photoionisation modelling
of our optical spectra using CLOUDY.

5 PHOTOIONISATION MODEL ANALYSIS

We use the CLOUDY photoionisation code, c13.05 (Ferland et
al., 2013) to model the emission line spectra of RS Oph observed
during and after its recent outburst in 2006. We have chosen
representative spectra on 9 epochs covering a duration of ∼ 438
days. Modelling of data over such a long time period enables
sampling over a broader range of ionisation and excitation levels
in the emission lines, and thus helps to constrain the results more
accurately. This method has been used previously to determine
elemental analysis and physical characteristics of a few novae by
modelling the observed spectra, for example, QU Vul (Schwarz
et al. 2002), V1974 Cyg (Vanlandingham et al. 2005), V838
Her & V4160 Sgr (Schwarz et al. 2007), V1065 Cen (Helton et
al. 2010), RS Oph (Das & Mondal, 2015). CLOUDY generates
model spectra assuming a non-LTE, spherically expanding ejecta
illuminated by a central source, by solving the equations of thermal
and statistical equilibrium, using a set of input parameters. The
calculations incorporate effects of important ionisation processes,
e.g., photo, Auger, collisional, and recombination process viz.
three-body recombination, and charge
radiative, dielectronic,
transfer. The parameters specify the initial physical conditions
of the source and the ejected shell; the source parameters are
the spectral energy distribution of the continuum source which
is assumed to be a black body, its temperature and luminosity;
the shell parameters are density, inner and outer radii, geometry,
covering factor (fraction of 4π sr enclosed by the model shell),
ﬁlling factor (ratio of the contribution of dense shell to diffuse

shell) and elemental abundances (relative to solar). The shell
density n(r) which is set by hydrogen density, and the ﬁlling factor
f (r) may vary with radius, as given by the following relations,

n(r) = n(r0)(r/r0)αcm−3 & f (r) = f (r0)(r/r0)β,

(1)

where, r0 is the inner radius, α and β are exponents of power
laws. We choose α = −3, the ﬁlling factor = 0.1 and ﬁlling factor
power-law exponent, (β) = 0, which are the typical values used in
other CLOUDY studies for novae. The inner (Rin) and outer (Rout)
radii of the ejected spherical shell are held constant to reduce the
number of free parameters. Rin and Rout on each epoch were cal-
culated using the values of minimum (Vmin) and maximum (Vmax)
expansion velocities, respectively. We adopt initial shell velocities
as Vmin = 3500 km s−1 and Vmax = 4500 km s−1 during explosion,
based on the optical and near-infrared observations (this work, Das
et al. 2006 and Skopal et al. 2008). The velocities decrease with
time as t−0.40 for t 6 5 days, and as t−0.66 for t = 5 − 70 days. Us-
ing these relations, we calculate the minimum and maximum ve-
locities at each epoch, which are then used to calculate the values
of Rin and Rout at each epoch. We assume the continuum shape to
be a blackbody of high temperature, 105.95 > TBB > 104.2 K, as as-
sumed in the previous investigations, to ensure that it supplies the
correct amount of photons for photoionisation. Based on parame-
ter space discussed in the above, the CLOUDY output predicts the
model ﬂuxes of different emission lines, which are compared with
the observed ﬂuxes of emission lines after normalizing with respect
to Hβ.

Several spectra are generated by varying the free parameters,
e.g. hydrogen density, underlying luminosity, effective blackbody
temperature, and abundances of only those elements with observed
lines. The abundances of all other elements which do not show lines
in the observed spectra were ﬁxed at solar values. Due to the inho-
mogeneous nature of novae ejecta, we assume a two-component
model in the initial outburst phase: a higher density shell to best ﬁt
the lower ionisation lines, and a lower density shell to ﬁt the higher
ionisation lines. To reduce the number of free parameters, we use
the same parameters for each component, except hydrogen densi-
ties at the inner radius and the covering factors, assuming that the
sum of the two covering factors be less than or equal to 1. This in-
creases the number of total free parameters by 2 due to the second
component’s initial density and covering factor. The ﬁnal model
line ratios were calculated by adding each component’s line ratio
after multiplying by its covering factor. Fluxes of the model gen-
erated lines were then compared with ﬂuxes of the observed lines
and the best ﬁt model were chosen by calculating χ2 and reduced
χ2 (χ2

red) of the model given by,

χ2 =

n
∑
i=1

(Mi − Oi)2/σ2

i , & χ2

red = χ2/ν

(2)

where, n is the number of observed lines, np is the number of free
parameters, ν, the degree of freedom given by n − np, and Mi is the
modelled ratio of line ﬂux to hydrogen line ﬂux, Oi is the measured
ﬂux ratio, and σi is the error in the observed ﬂux ratio. We estimate
error in the range of 10 − 30%, depending upon the intensity of a
spectral line, possibility of blending with adjacent lines, and error
in the measuring line ﬂuxes. Values of χ2 ∼ ν and (χ2
red) value
should be low (typically in the range of 1 - 2) for a good ﬁt model.

6 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

6.1 Early Phase: 2006 February – May

Relative ﬂuxes of the best-ﬁt model predicted lines, observed lines
and corresponding χ2 values during the early phase are presented in
Table 2. Here, we have considered the lines which are present both
in the model generated and observed spectra for the calculation
of χ2 values. The observed line ﬂuxes have been determined us-
ing IRAF tasks; the proﬁles which have multiple components have
been decomposed with multiple Gaussians using IRAF tasks. To
minimize errors associated with ﬂux calibration between different
epochs, the modelled and observed ﬂux ratios have been calculated
relative to Hβ. The values of best-ﬁt parameters are presented in Ta-
ble 4. The best ﬁt modelled spectra (grey lines) with the observed
optical spectra (black lines) during this phase are shown in Figures
18 - 22. The spectra, in the early phase, are dominated by prominent
features of low ionisation lines, e.g. Hε (3970 ˚A), Hδ (4101 ˚A), Hγ
(4340 ˚A), He II (4686 ˚A), Hβ (4863 ˚A). There are also some higher
ionisation lines, e.g. [Fe VII] (3760 ˚A), Fe II and [Ni XII] (4233 ˚A),
He I and [Ar IV] (4713 ˚A), [Ar X] (5535 ˚A), [Fe XI] (7890 ˚A), [Fe
X] (6374 ˚A), [Fe XIV] (5303 ˚A) etc., which started to appear at
the end of the early phase. Since, the gas is highly inhomogeneous
at this time, a one component model was unable to ﬁt the Hα/Hβ
ﬂux ratio properly. So, we had to consider a two component model.
The ﬁrst component (clump) consisted of a highly dense cloud to
ﬁt the lower ionisation lines. This component was optically thick,
and Case-B was taken into consideration as well. Majority of the
observed lines were generated using this component, but it under-
represents the highest ionisation lines. The second component (dif-
fuse), with a lower density, was less (10 − 30%) in volume, but it
allowed the source photon to ionise some of the species to their
higher ionisation states (e.g. [Ar IV] (4713 ˚A), [Ar X] (5535 ˚A)),
while not changing the clump contribution to the spectra.

Initially, in 2006 February, the ionising source is surrounded
by a dense (nH ∼ 1011 cm−3) cloud. So, the effective temperature
and luminosity (T ∼ 104.45 K, L ∼ 1036.8 erg s−1) of the source is
relatively lower. As the ejecta expands, more energy from the cen-
tral engine comes out. Therefore, while the ejecta density decreases
(nH ∼ 108.41 cm−3), the blackbody temperature (TBB) and the lu-
minosity increases to TBB ∼ 105.6 K and L ∼ 1037.1 erg s−1, re-
spectively in 2006 May to photoionise more matter. The estimated
elemental abundances during this phase are given as logarithm of
the numbers relative to hydrogen and relative to solar in Table 4.
The values show that helium, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, argon, iron
and nickel abundances are all enhanced relative to solar whereas
abundances of calcium and sulphur are at solar values. However,
we must be cautious while considering the abundances of calcium,
because calcium abundance was calculated using only the Ca V
(6086 ˚A) line observed on 2006 May 26. This line is blended with
[Fe VII]. So, ﬁrst iron abundance was set using the other promi-
nent Fe II (4180 ˚A, 4415 ˚A and 4584 ˚A) lines. Then, the calcium
abundance was changed such that the total ﬂux of the blended fea-
ture in the model matched the observed spectra. Similarly, nitrogen
abundance on day 28 was determined using the N II (5535 ˚A) line
blended with [Ar X]. But, on days 50 and 103, there are two other
N II (4242 ˚A and 5755 ˚A) lines that helped to set the nitrogen abun-
dance correctly. These values match well with the results obtained
by Das & Mondal (2015).

6.2 Nebular Phase: 2006 July – October

Prominent appearance of higher ionisation lines like [O III](4363,
4959, 5007 ˚A) and [O I] (6300 ˚A) in the day 103 spectrum indi-
cates that the nova is entering the nebular phase. Due to the ex-
pansion of the shell, the cloud becomes thinner and consequently
higher ionisation lines are seen in the spectra. Modelling of nebular
phase was simpler as only one component of relatively lower hy-
drogen density was sufﬁcient to generate the high as well as the low
ionisation emission lines observed in the spectra. The line ﬂuxes
and χ2 values are presented in Table 3 and the best-ﬁt model pa-
rameters are presented in Table 4. During this phase, the effective
temperature and luminosity were increased to 105.95 K and 1037.5
ergs s−1, respectively, and the hydrogen density was decreased to
107.18 cm−3 to match the observed spectra. The estimated value of

temperature is in agreement with the WD temperature of around
8 × 105 K derived from X-ray studies (Nelson et al. 2008). Dur-
ing the early phase, we have seen that the abundances of several
elements were enhanced relative to solar, but as the nebular phase
set in, the oxygen, neon and iron abundances become sub-solar,
whereas, sulphur abundance enhanced from a solar abundance seen
in the early phase. In the nebular phase also the calcium abundance,
which was at solar value, was calculated using only the blended Ca

V (6086 ˚A) line. But, the nitrogen abundance was determined cor-
rectly as the prominent [N II] (5755 ˚A) line is highly sensitive to
the change in abundance parameter in CLOUDY. The best ﬁt mod-
elled spectra (grey lines) with the observed optical spectra (black
lines) during this phase are shown in Figures 23 - 25.

6.3 Quiescence Phase

On 17 October, around ∼ 250 days after the 2006 nova outburst, the
spectrum shows a red continuum with clear TiO absorption bands
at 4762, 5448, 5598, 5629 and 6159 ˚A. The absorption band in-
dices indicate the secondary spectral type to be M2-M3. By this
day the nebular line strengths have decreased. The Fe II permit-

ted lines normally seen in quiescence begin to appear. A year later,
in 2007 April, when the nova reached quiescence, the continuum
is bluer compared to the day ∼ 250 spectrum, indicating the pres-
ence of an accretion disk. The quiescence phase spectrum shows
prominent emission lines of H and He I, together with strong TiO

absorption features that indicate the dominance of the secondary in
the spectrum.

The elemental abundances during quiescence period was esti-
mated by photoionisation modelling of the spectrum observed on
2007 April 26. To generate the model spectrum, three components
were considered: a WD (T = 104.2 K) as an ionising source, a cylin-
drical accretion disk (semi height = 108 cm) surrounding the source
and the secondary red giant of spectral type M2 III (Worters et al.
2007 and Anupama & Mikolajewska 1999). The ﬁnal spectrum
was obtained by adding the ﬂuxes generated by these three com-
ponents. The relative ﬂuxes of the best-ﬁt model predicted lines,
observed lines and corresponding χ2 values during quiescence pe-
riod are presented in Table 5, and the best ﬁt model parameters are
presented in Table 6. The best ﬁt parameters lead us to an accre-
tion disk of low temperature (104.2 K) and low luminosity (1033

c(cid:13) 2017 RAS, MNRAS 000, ??–??

ergs s−1, and a luminosity of 1035 ergs s−1 for the red giant). As
the dense H-rich material is accreted to the disk, the hydrogen den-
sity of the disk (1011 cm−3) is ∼ 10 times higher than that in the
red giant (1010 cm−3). The Rin and Rout of the disk are calculated
considering a high mass WD of 1.35 M⊙(e.g. Kato, Hachisu &
Luna 2008). During the quiescence phase, the observed spectrum
shows prominent H and He lines only. The estimated abundances
of helium is 0.8, which is subsolar. Since there were no prominent
lines of other elements, the abundances of other elements could not
be estimated. The best ﬁt modelled spectrum (grey lines), along
with the observed optical spectrum (black lines) during this phase
is shown in Figure 26.

6.4 Comments on the models

Low values of χ2
red (between 1.05 to 1.44) indicate that the model
generated spectra match well with the observed ones. However, in-
spite of the low χ2
red values, there are a few discrepancies. An in-
spection of Tables 2 and 3 shows that χ2 values of some lines are
relatively higher. For example, Hα (6563 ˚A) on most of the epochs

and Hγ (4340 ˚A) on 2006 February 21 are the highest contribu-
tors to the χ2 values. Hence, total χ2 value increases when these
two strong lines are considered. Also, while adding the two com-
ponents, emphasis was given to minimize the total χ2 value, which
leads to difﬁculty in matching the line ﬂux ratios perfectly to the
observed one. This problem disappears during the nebular phase
spectra modelling where only one component of Hydrogen density
was enough to ﬁt all the lines. The other lines that contribute to
higher χ2 values are: [Fe X] (6374 ˚A) and He I (6678 ˚A) on 2006
April 3. This is not surprising since [Fe X] is a coronal line, most
likely excited by the shock interaction. The He I line is suppressed
due to a high optical depth, which is not well accounted for in the
model. The He II line at 4686 ˚A in the modelled spectrum was weak
on February 21 and 24. This is possibly because the temperature of
the source on those two epochs (104.45 & 104.5 K respectively) was
low. Higher temperature & 104.7 K is required to generate the He
II line (ionization potential ∼ 54.4 eV) prominently, as seen in the
spectra of March 12 onwards, when the central source temperature
was & 105 K. Further, the He II 4686 line was very weak in the ob-
served spectra on those two epochs, and it was difﬁcult to measure
the ﬂux correctly. Therefore, the He II feature was not included in
the calculation of the total χ2 for those epochs. In spite of the dis-
crepancies, these ﬁts do minimize the total χ2 values. During the
nebular phases, the highest contributions to the total χ2 is due to
the blending of [O III], Fe II and He I lines at 5007 ˚A. Also, the
abundances for Fe, He and O were set after matching the other Fe,
He and O lines, which leads to a high (about 30 - 40%) χ2 con-
tribution. Additionally, the model could not generate a few of the
observed lines, e.g., N III (4640 ˚A), Si II (5041, 5056 ˚A), Ca II
(8668, 8548 ˚A), O I (7774, 8446 ˚A) and O VI (6106 ˚A). Some of
these issues have been reported in our previous CLOUDY analysis
of RS Oph spectra (Das & Mondal, 2015). So, these lines have been
excluded while calculating the values of χ2. This is possibly due to
the reason that even a two-component model can not properly rep-
resent the complex density structure of the nova ejecta.

(i) This is the ﬁrst outburst of RS Oph which has revealed the
complexity of emission mechanisms. This has been possible only
due to the wide spectral and temporal coverage of the observations.
(ii) The evolution of the optical spectrum is very similar to pre-

vious outbursts.

(iii) The emission line velocity evolution indicates that the rem-
nant was in the adiabatic phase for a very brief period and quickly
moved to the radiative cooling phase by t ∼ 5 days. The nova rem-
nant probably reached the edge of the red giant wind by ∼ 80 days,
as indicated by the marginal increase in the emission line velocity.
These ﬁndings are consistent with those based on X-ray observa-
tions (Bode et al. 2006).

(iv) The nebular lines originate in a region closer to the WD
while the recombination lines originate in the decelerating material.
(v) The observed spectra are modelled using the photoionisation
code CLOUDY for 9 epochs. Based on the modelling, the elemen-
tal abundances and other parameters such as the temperature and
density of the ejecta, and the luminosity of the WD at the various
epochs are estimated.

8 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We thank the HCT Time Allocation Committee for a generous al-
location of ToO time. We also thank all the observers of both the
HCT and the VBT, who spared part of their observing time for the
nova observations, without which the dense monitoring during the
early phases of the outburst would not have been possible.
