Abstract

Computing moments of various parameter estimators related to an
autoregressive model of Statistics, one needs to evaluate several non-trivial
limits. This was done by [3] for the case of two, three and four dimensions;
in this article, we present a proof of a fully general formula, based on an
ingenious solution of [1].

1 Introduction

The autoregressive model of Statistics generates a random sequence of observa-
tions by

Xi = α1Xi−1 + α2Xi−2 + ... + αkXi−k + εi
(1)
where εi are independent, Normally distributed random variables with the mean
of 0 and the same standard deviation, and k is a ﬁxed integer, usually quite small
(e.g. k = 1 deﬁnes the so called Markov model). The suﬃcient and necessary
condition for the resulting sequence to be asymptotically stationary is that all
k solutions of the characteristic polynomial

λk = α1λk−1 + α2λk−2 + ... + αk

(2)

are, in absolute value, smaller than 1 (this is then assumed from now on).

The jth-order serial correlation coeﬃcient ρj (between Xi and Xi+j ) is then

computed by

ρj = A1λ|j|

(3)
where the λi’s are the k roots of (2), and the Ai coeﬃcients are themselves
simple functions of these roots. Note that the absolute value of each root must
be smaller than 1 if the resulting stochastic process is be stationary.

Computing the ﬁrst few moments of various estimators (of the αi parame-

ters) boils down to computing moments of expressions of the

type, where X1, X2, ...Xn is a collection of n consecutive observations (assuming
that the process has already reached its stationary phase).

i=1
X

This in turn requires evaluating various summations (see [4]), of which the

most diﬃcult has the form of

˜n

i1,i2,...ik=1
X

λ|i1−i2+s1|
1

λ|i2−i3+s2|
2

...λ|ik−i1+sk|

k

(6)

where λ1, λ2, ...λk are the λi roots (some may be multiple), s1, s2, ...sk are
(small) integers, and ˜n indicates that the upper limit equals to n, adjusted in
the manner of (5).

For small k, it is possible (but rather messy - see [2]) to exactly evaluate (6)

and realize that the answer will always consist of three parts:

• terms proportional to λn

i , which all tend to zero (as n increases) ‘expo-

nentially’,

• terms which stay constant as n increases,

• terms proportional to n.

Luckily, to build an approximation which is usually deemed suﬃcient (see
[4]), we need to ﬁnd only the n proportional terms. These can be extracted by
dividing (6) by n and taking the n → ∞ limit. Incidentally, this results in the
following (and most welcomed) simpliﬁcation: the corresponding answer will be
the same regardless of the ˜n adjustments (thus, we may as well use n instead),
and will similarly not depend on the individual si’s, but only on the absolute
value of their sum, as the following statement indicates.

where S is the non-negative integer of the theorem.

When S ≥ 0, a term of BS and a term of the A summation are considered
identical (we also say that they match each other) only when m1 = −i1 +i2 +s1,
m2 = −i2 + i3 + s2, ... mk−1 = −ik−1 + ik + sk−1 (implying mk = −ik + i1 + sk,
since the m’s and s’s must add up to the same S, and the ´ı’s cancel); note
that this also implies (but not the reverse) that such matching terms have the
same value. On the other hand, when S < 0, we declare them identical when
m1 = i1 − i2 − s1, etc. instead. From now on, we assume that S ≥ 0 to avoid a
trivial duplication of all subsequent arguments.

Clearly, each term of the A summation matches a term of BS:

just take
mp = −ip +ip+1 +sp where p = 1, 2, ...k, with the understanding that ik+1 = i1.
At the same time, no term of BS is matched by more than n terms of the A
summation, since once you select i1 (from any of its n possible values), all the
remaining i’s are uniquely determined by i2 = m1 + i1 − s1, i3 = m2 + i2 − s2,
etc., resulting in a term of A only when all of these turn out to be between 1
and n (inclusive).

This proves that A ≤ BS.
Since |λ1||m1| ≤ 1,

∞

BS <

|λ2||m2||λ3||m3|...|λk||mk|

m2,m3,...mk=−∞
X

implying that the BS sum is (absolutely) convergent; let B∞ denote its actual
value. This means that any number smaller that B∞ (say B0) can be exceeded
by a sum of ﬁnitely many terms of BS (this is true for any convergent series).
Now, let us go back to counting how many terms of the A summation match
a single, speciﬁc term of BS; we have already seen that, starting with any one
of the possible n values of i1, the subsequent i’s would be computed by

p−1

ip = i1 +

(mj − sj)

where

p = 2...k

j=1
X

matching a term of the A summation only when they are all in the 1 to n range,
i.e. when

p−1

and

1 ≤ i1 + min
p=2...k

(mj − sj)

j=1
X

p−1

i1 + max
p=2...k

j=1
X

(mj − sj) ≤ n

This implies that, for each choice of i1 which meet

p−1

1 − min
p=2..k

j=1
X

(mj − sj) ≤ i1 ≤ n − max
p=2..k

(mj − sj)

p−1

j=1

we get a legitimate term of the A summation (matching and having the same
value as the speciﬁc term of BS); we thus have

n − max
p=2...k

p−1

j=1
X

(mj − sj) + min
p=2..k

p−1

(mj − sj)

j=1
X

such terms in total. Dividing their sum by n and taking the n → ∞ limit thus
yields the value of the speciﬁc BS term.

This can be repeated for any term of the ﬁnite sum of the previous paragraph;
thus we get A ≥ B0. And, since we can make B0 as close to B∞ as we wish,
this implies that A ≥ B∞.

We have thus shown that (7) and (8) have the same value.
We now deﬁne the following Laurent series of the BS sequence (allow-
ing S to have any integer value, and assuming that maxℓ=1...k |λℓ| < |t| <
minℓ=1...k |λℓ|−1), namely

where the last expression is the partial-fraction expansion of the previous ratio-
nal function of t (the roots of the common denominator are the λ’s and their
inverses). We can now get a formula for B∞ (and thus for our A limit) as a
coeﬃcient of tS of the last expression. Since only the Cj part contributes to
non-negative powers of t, and

This proves the original statement.

3 Conclusion

The formula of (7) then enables us to evaluate all the expected values needed
to deal with any autoregressive model of type (1). Note that in some cases the
set of λi values may consist of only a subset of of roots of (2); this only reduces
the value of k and makes the result that much easier.

A modiﬁcation of the formula is needed when some of the λi’s are identical ;
in that case all we have to do is to evaluate the formula’s corresponding limit,
such as λ5 → λ2 when the two λ’s have the same value (in the case of triple roots,
we would need to take two consecutive limits, etc.). This yields a multitude of
new (and rather messy) formulas not worth quoting - suﬃces to say that they
all result (as they must) in a ﬁnite expression.

A further challenge would be to ﬁnd the constant part of (6).
