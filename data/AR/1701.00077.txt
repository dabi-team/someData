Learning Weighted Association Rules in Human

Phenotype Ontology.

Pietro Hiram Guzzi, Giuseppe Agapito, Marianna Milano, Mario Cannataro

January 3, 2017

Abstract

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a structured repository of

concepts (HPO Terms) that are associated to one or more diseases. The

process of association is referred to as annotation. The relevance and the

speciﬁcity of both HPO terms and annotations are evaluated by a mea-

sure deﬁned as Information Content (IC). The analysis of annotated data

is thus an important challenge for bioinformatics. There exist diﬀerent

approaches of analysis. From those, the use of Association Rules (AR)

may provide useful knowledge, and it has been used in some applications,

e.g.

improving the quality of annotations. Nevertheless classical associ-

ation rules algorithms do not take into account the source of annotation

nor the importance yielding to the generation of candidate rules with low

IC. This paper presents HPO-Miner (Human Phenotype Ontology-based

Weighted Association Rules) a methodology for extracting Weighted As-

sociation Rules. HPO-Miner can extract relevant rules from a biological

point of view. A case study on using of HPO-Miner on publicly available

HPO annotation datasets is used to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our

methodology.

1 Introduction

In computer science, the term ontology deﬁnes a set of representational primi-

tives with which to model a domain of knowledge or discourse [1]. In particular,

ontologies are mainly used in bioinformatics and computational biology.

For instance, the Gene Ontology aims to provide a common language to de-

scribe genes product [2]. More recently, the annotation eﬀorts have also focused

on the description of relation among molecular biology and disease, leading to

the introduction of novel ontologies such as Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)

[] and Disease Ontology (DO) [].

HPO aims to provide a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormali-

ties encountered in human diseases. A generic HPO annotation contains a link

between a disease and phenotypic abnormality. A disease is indexed by using

a uniﬁed identiﬁer known as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM).

OMIM is a comprehensive, authoritative compendium of human genes and ge-

netic phenotypes that are freely available and updated daily [3]. The Disease

Ontology (DO) has been developed as a standardized ontology for human dis-

ease with the purpose of providing strong and sustainable descriptions of human

disease terms and phenotype characteristics [4].

The amount of annotations available is steadily growing, raising new chal-

lenges to face, related to ambiguous or incomplete annotations and ontology

terms [5]. The annotation task is becoming an even harder challenge in the ge-

nomic era, which is characterized by an unprecedented growth in the production

of genes, gene products, and even other information. To speed-up the updat-

ing and maintenance processes of ontologies and annotations, it is required the

development of computational approaches that guarantee a remarkable speed,

on the current approaches of annotation carried out manually by the curators.

The literature contains several computational methods developed to aid GO

2

curators to improve GO annotations consistency [6], [7], [8]. As opposed to GO,

in literature, there are only a few automatic methodologies able to aid the HPO

curators to improve annotation consistency and retrieve link between terms not

explicitly related.

As demonstrated in some recent works by Faria et al.

[9], by Manda et

al.

[10], and by Agapito et al.

[11, 12], association rules may be used to im-

prove annotations consistency and highlight relationships among terms did not

seem explicitly related. In this work, we present HPO-Miner an improvement

of our previous works in which we introduced GO-WAR [12]. HPO-Miner is a

tool for learning weighted association rules (WAR) to check annotation consis-

tency and to identify hidden relationships between two phenotype abnormalities

from HPO. Traditional association rule approaches are not able to distinguish

between items; they are unaware of the relevance of terms yielding to the gener-

ation of rules with low speciﬁcity. The speciﬁcity of each term may be measured

by the information content (IC) of a term [13]. The use of IC computed for each

HPO term, is a measure of the speciﬁcity of a term, yielding to the IC-weighted

annotation as conveyed in the following: OMIM100100: (HP:0000126, 11.18),

(HP:0000144, 9.57). HPO-Miner is able to extract weighted association rules

starting from an annotated dataset of diseases. The proposed approach is based

on the following steps: (i) initially we rearrange the information for each OMIM

term to get transactional data; (ii) then, we extract weighted association rules

using a modiﬁed FP-Tree like algorithm able to deal with the dimension of

classical biological datasets. We use publicly available HPO annotation data to

demonstrate our method.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses HPO-Miner

methodology and implementation, Section 4 presents results of the application

of HPO-Miner on a biological dataset. Finally Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 The Human Phenotype Ontology

HPO is a structured and controlled vocabulary with more than 10,000 terms

able to describe the phenotypic abnormalities in human diseases. HPO pro-

vides annotations of more than 7,000 human hereditary syndromes and other

phenotypic abnormalities that characterize the diseases, are also available at

the website 1. HPO consists of three independent sub-ontologies: the mode of

inheritance i.e. the way in which a speciﬁc hereditary attribute is transmitted

from a generation to another, onset and clinical course i.e.

in medicine refers

to the ﬁrst symptoms of a sickness and the medical treatments involved to cure

them and ﬁnally, the phenotypic abnormalities i.e.

the abnormal traits of a

living organism that are possible to observe. As other ontologies, terms in HPO

are organized in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The relations among DAG’s

terms are modelled by means of is a and part of edges ”relations”, in order

to distinguish between general or speciﬁc terms. Moreover, terms in HPO are

arranged in a hierarchical way, where each path respects the true-path-rule. To

each HPO class is assigned a stable and unique identiﬁer (e.g. HP:0001629 ), a

label and a list of synonyms, describing a well deﬁnite phenotypic abnormality

i.e. ”Ventricular Septal Defect ” see Figure 1.

Diseases are annotated with terms of the HPO, meaning that HPO terms are

used to describe all the signs, symptoms, and other phenotypic manifestations

that characterize the disease in question.

The annotations of OMIM entries are a mixture of manual annotations per-

formed by the HPO curators team and automated matching of the OMIM Clin-

ical Synopsis to HPO term labels. In particular HPO is an ontology designed

to provide qualitative information and not to capture quantitative information

such as body weight or height. Each diseases may be annotated to multiple HPO

terms. Consequently the need of the introduction of methodologies and tools to

support HPO curators to improve annotation consistency and the structure of

the ontology arises.

2.2 Association Rules

Association Rule (AR) extraction is very popular in data mining, it is used for

discovering associations in market basket analysis and unknown relations among

features in databases. Historically, was proposed by Agrawal [14] to discovery

associations to support marketing decision.

Formally, the association rules extraction problem may be stated as follows:

let I = {i1, i2, . . . , in} be a set of items and D = {t1, . . . , tm} a transactional

database that contains a set of transactions, where a transaction tj is a subset

of items belonging to I. An association rule is an implication of the form

5

A → B, where A and B are two disjoint sets. AR are based on two fundamental

properties to deﬁne the relevance of the mined rules, Support and Conﬁdence.

The formal Support deﬁnition is:

Deﬁnition 2.1. S(A → B) = σ(A∪B)

N

Where N is the total number of transactions contained in D and σ is called

support count, namely, the number of transaction that contain a particular item.

The Conﬁdence is deﬁned as:

Deﬁnition 2.2. C(A → B) = σ(A∪B)
σ(A)

.

Where σ(A) is the number of transactions in D containing A and σ(A ∪ B)

is the number of transactions in D that contains both items A and B.

A drawback with the use of classical AR approach is that it precludes the

derivation of certain rules in which the items have a very diﬀerent levels of sup-

port. In several areas do not make sense to assign equal importance to all items

involved in the dataset. For example in the supermarket context, some items

like computer, smartphone have much value than trivial items like ice-cream or

butter. Rules involving smartphone or computer have less support than those

involving butter or ice-cream but are much more signiﬁcant in term of proﬁt by

the store. In the ontology context, the term HP:0000924 (An abnormality of the

skeletal system) has a relevance value (IC value) lower than HP:0011803 (Biﬁd

nose) although it is much more frequent. Rules involving the term HP:0000924

are less interesting (as it is a more general term) then rules involving the term

HP:0011803 (as it is a more speciﬁc term) in terms of actionable knowledge.

This limitation of classical AR approach can be overcome by introducing the

weighted association rules (WAR). WAR models the signiﬁcance of a term by

means of a weight (ω). A weight (ω) is a positive real number that reﬂect the

6

relevance of a HPO terms, for which high values represent very signiﬁcant items

as reported in [15, 16]. In our case, the relevance can be represented by using

the information content (IC ).

A generic HPO dataset is a list of OMIM identiﬁers annotated with multiple

HPO terms, as conveyed in Figure 2.

OMIM100100  HP:0000144

Figure 2: An example of HPO dataset.

In order to extract rules from the HPO dataset, it is necessary to convert it in

a format more suitable to represent transaction data. The conversion consists in

put together the same OMIM identiﬁers that became the transaction identiﬁer

while the HPO terms associated with the current OMIM identiﬁer are the items

of the transaction, as depicted in Figure 3.

2.3 Weighting HPO term with Information Content

Each HP term is associated to IC value. There exist diﬀerent IC formulations

that fall into two classes, intrinsic and extrinsic methods. Intrinsic method rely

on the topology of the GO graph analyzing the positions of terms in a taxonomy.

In this way the approaches deﬁne information content for each term. Diﬀerent

topological characteristics as ancestors, number of children, depth (see[13] for a

7

complete review) can used in order to estimate the Intrinsic IC calculus. Instead

the extrinsic approaches involve annotation data for an considered corpus. In

this work we used the intrinsic method proposed by Sanchez et al. [17], Harispe

et al.[13], Resnick et al. [18], Seco et al. [19], Zhou et al. [20].

The measure of Sanchez exploits only the number of leaves and the set of

ancestors of a including itself, subsumers(a) and introduce the root node as the

number of leaves max leaves in IC assessment. Leaves are more informative

than concepts with many leaves, roots, so the leaves are suited to describe and

to distinguish any concept.

ICSanchez et al.(a) = −log 



|leaves(a)|

|subsumers(a)| + 1
max leaves + 1





(1)

Harispe et al., in oder to highlights the speciﬁcity of leaves according to

their number of ancestors, consider leaves(a) = a concept when a is a root and

evaluating max leaves as the number of inclusive ancestors of a node revising

the IC assessment suggested by Sanchez et al.

ICHarispe et al.(a) = −log 



|leaves(a)|
|subsumers(a)|
max leaves





(2)

The formulation provided from Resnick et al. computes the IC of a concept

evaluating all the top-downs path from a concept a to the reachable leaves, p(a),

and then calculates the log yielding to the formula:

ICResnik(a) = −log(p(a)).

(3)

Seco et al. calculate the IC of a concept by considering the ratio between

the number of hyponyms in ontology, for example, the number of descendant

8

with respect to the whole number of ontological concepts.

ICSeco et al(a) =

hypo(a)+1
max nodes

1
max nodes

log

log

(cid:16)

(cid:0)

(cid:17)

(cid:1)

(4)

Thus Zhou et al. considers the depth of a concept in a taxonomy, depth(a),

and the maximum depth of the taxonomy max depth.

ICZhou et al.(a) = k −

1 − log(hypo(a) + 1)

log(max nodes) (cid:19)

(cid:18)

+ (1 − k)

log(depth(a))
log(depth nodes) (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(5)

In this formulation K is a factor which enables to weight the contribution of the

two evaluated features.

3 The HPO-Miner Algorithm

In this section we brieﬂy describe the HPO-Miner algorithm, developed to ex-

tract weighted association rules form HPO dataset.

First of all we deﬁne the Weighted Item x, i.e. a weighted HPO item is ob-

tained by multiplying the number of occurrences of item x by the value of its re-

lated value of IC (the weight ω). We deﬁne as W eightedSupport, (ωS), obtained

by integrating the classical formulation of the support of an item by its weight.

The weighted Support ωS of a generic item xi is deﬁned as: ωS(xi) = wi ∗ σ(xi)

where ωi is the information content of the i-th term and σ(xi) is the number

of transaction containing xi. Let I = {i1 . . . im} be a set of weighted items

(HPO terms) and let W D be a set of weighted transactions database, where

each transaction tj is a sub-set of weighted items such that tj belongs to I. We

deﬁned the weighted minimum support (mωS) as:

Deﬁnition 3.1. mωS =

P|W D|

i=1 σ(xi)∗ωi
|W D|

(cid:18)

∗ p.

(cid:19)

9

Where, |W D| is the cardinality of the weighted database nominally, the

number of transactions into the dataset, p is a threshold value given in input

by the user in order to deﬁne which items are signiﬁcant in percentage. Thus

only the items for which the following constraint ωS(I) ≥ mωS is veriﬁed, are

signiﬁcant and can be used as candidates to generate frequent item-sets and

rules.

Algorithm 1 is a summary of the main phases of theHPO-Miner algorithm.

The ﬁrst step of HPO-Miner algorithm is the loading of the input HPO dataset

(D) and its transformation in weightedTable W T a data structure suitable to

represent weighted transaction data (as reported in Algorithm 1 row 2). Con-

currently to the loading and conversion phase, are evaluated the occurrences of

each HPO term in D. Subsequently is possible to obtain a list of frequent

weighted items (as stated in Algorithm 1 at row 3). We remove from the

F W ItemsList the weighted items for which is not veriﬁed the following con-

dition: ωS(I) ≥ mωS. Frequent weighted items are hence used to build a data

structure based on F P − T ree. Finally, HPO-Miner iteratively analyzes the

F P − T ree in order to mine and save signiﬁcant rules.

4 Results

HPO database is freely available online 2, the size of the dataset is about 4.4 MB on

disk. After collecting data, by using all the methods introduced in Section 2, we

produced 5 diﬀerent datasets. We tested HPO-Miner using several combinations

of values for weightedSupport and conﬁdence. Then we selected the values for

the parameters able to ensure the best results in terms of reduced number of

mined rules and in the same time with relevant values of weightedSupport and

conﬁdence. The best combination of values was weightedSupport equal to 50%

and conﬁdence greater than 80%. We chose the ﬁrst top 10 rules from each

dataset, and we manually analyzed the literature to ﬁnd claims that can prove

the validity of the mined rules.

4.1 HPO-Miner rules extraction comparison

The eﬀectiveness of HPO-Miner is proved comparing our tool with respect to

other well known tools such as: Knime [21] and Weka [22]. We chose these

tools because both provides an implementation of the FP-Growth algorithm

a necessary condition in order to fairly compare HPO-Miner with both tools.

The FP-Growth algorithm implementation in Weka and Knime, is able to han-

dle only binary attributes, making both tools unable to analyze weighted HPO

datasets enriched with IC values. A possible way to make weighted HPO en-

riched dataset compatible with Weka and Knime is to leave for each OMIM

entry only two HPO terms, making this solution infeasible because leads to lose

a lot of useful information. Diﬀerently, HPO-Miner is the only tool that comes

with a version of FP-Growth able to handle a generic number of attribute for

each OMIM entry, making it suitable to analyze HPO dataset enriched with IC

values.

both terms could be related with defects in the biological mechanisms of the

liver. In particular, Autosomal recessive inheritance suggests a biochemical de-

fect that might cause a metabolic disorder in the liver while, Giant cell hepatitis

is responsible of ”thick bile syndrome” in neonatal. Consequently, HPO-Miner

was able to found a relation between two apparently unrelated terms into the

graph of HPO classes.

Rule (2R) (HP:0200084, HP:0002910) i.e., (Giant cell hepatitis, Elevated

hepatic transaminases) consists of two terms involved in the hepatitis process.

Analyzing in depth the literature it revealed the following links between the

two terms. In [24] is presented a study on three siblings with neonatal jaundice

who died before the age of three months. They were shown on autopsy to be

suﬀering from Niemann-Pick disease together with a giant cell transformation of

the liver. Clayton et. al. in [25] including the infant studied in [26] were able to

inferrer, that due to the elevated transaminases most patients develop hepatic

13

ﬁbrosis or cirrhosis due to the presence of Giant cell hepatitis. Thus, manually

analyzing this rule has been possible to infer that both terms are responsible of

the liver disorder in infants and adults.

Rule (3R) involves the following two HPO terms (HP:0200067, HP:0000006)

i.e.,Recurrent spontaneous abortion and Autosomal dominant inheritance. There

is a growing literature on the importance of Autosomal dominant inheritance in

pregnancy complications as reported in [27]. As stated in [28] Thrombophilia is

a cause of maternal mortality due to certain inherited thrombophilic factors that

activated protein C resistance. In [29] the authors point out the rare familial

disorders that are usually inherited as Autosomal dominant inheritance.

Rule (4R) (HP:0100818, HP:0000774) composed by the following phenotypic

abnormalities Long thorax, Narrow chest involved in the syndrome of Jeune and

Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome as reported in literature in [30, 31]. Browsing HPO

Ontology with its on line browser did not reveal any information that allows the

user to associate both abnormalities with the syndrome of Juene and Ellis-Van

Creveld. This may suggest to the curator to restructure ontology in order to

make easily available this knowledge in order to clarify these associations.

Rule (5R) (HP:0100775, HP:0001537) whose translation is Dural ectasia,

Umbilical hernia at ﬁrst glance seems that there not exists a connection among

the two terms. Analyzing the literature we found the work of Mizuguchi et.al.

[32] and Chen et. al., [33]. In Mizuguchi et.al. have been found both abnormali-

ties in a patient aﬀected by the Marfan syndrome in infancy, instead Chen et. al.

have found these abnormalities in patients aﬀected by Lateral meningocele syn-

drome. These knowledge it is not readily available for the users by using HPO,

consequently this may suggest to the curator to add this further knowledge into

the HPO.

Rule (6R) (HP:0012023, HP:0000007) deﬁne an association between the

14

Galactosuria and Autosomal recessive inheritance. Analyzing the literature

looking for evidence on the validity of the association we found the works of

Pickering et. al., [34] and Monteleone et. al.

[35], in which in both works,

the authors stated that hereditary galactokinase deﬁciency is characterized by

galactosuria. In particular, in this study support the autosomal recessive in-

heritance of this disorder. This evidence support the validity of the current

association found it by using HPO-Miner.

To verify the reliability of Rule (7R) (HP:0100775,HP:0000494) i.e. (Dural

ectasia, Downslanted palpebral ﬁssures) and Rule (8R) (HP:0100775, HP:0000316)

i.e., Dural ectasia, Hypertelorism, we analyzed the literature founding that the

terms of both rules are symptoms involved in the Marfan syndrome as stated in

[36, 37]. Consequently these association rules may suggest to the curator to add

new informative links among HPO terms, making easier for the users to obtain

further knowledge.

Rule (9R) (HP:0100626, HP:0001394) refers to Chronic hepatic failure and

Cirrhosis. Analyzing the literature showed that both terms are involved in fat

elimination as stated in the work of Druml et. al. [38]. This evidence may be

suggest to the curator to make this explicit knowledge in implicit, by adding

new links among the HPO terms.

(10R) (HP:0100626, HP:0000007) Chronic hepatic failure, Autosomal reces-

sive inheritance

Here we discuss the rules contained in Table 2 that refer to the rules mined

by HPO-Miner from the Sanchez dataset.

Rule (1S) (HP:010081, HP:0000774) i.e., (Long thorax, Narrow chest ) con-

sists in two terms involved in the Asphyxiating Thoracic Dysplasia (Jeune Syn-

drome).Jeune syndrome is a congenital disorder with abnormalities of which

thoracic hypoplasia is the most prominent. The literature conﬁrms that both

15

phenotype, long thorax and narrow chest are manifestations of Jeune syndrome.

In [39] is reported this evidence.

Rule (2S) (HP:0030034, HP:0003774) associates withDiﬀuse glomerular base-

ment membrane lamellation, Stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Searching in the

current literature the glomerular basement membrane lamellation is a mani-

festation in patients after transplantation of kidneys from pediatric cadaveric

donors, as [40] reported. There is not evidence that this phenotype is related

to the Stage 5 chronic kidney disease.

About the Rule (3S) (HP:0012743, HP:0001773), Abdominal obesity, Short

foot we didn’t ﬁnd a correlation among Abdominal obesity(term 1) and Short

foot (term 2) despite a depth research in literature was conducted .

Rule (4S) (HP:0012263, HP:0000007) and Rule (5S) (HP:0012023, HP:0000007),

associate two pathologic phenotypes, Immotile cilia and (Galactosuria to Auto-

somal recessive inheritance). In fact, in [41] is reported that the immotile cilia

syndrome seems to be that of an autosomal recessive disease; as well as galacto-

suria due to galactokinase deﬁciency in a newborn is inherited in an autosomal

recessive manner [34].

HPO-MINER ﬁnds the Rule (6S) (HP:0011727, HP:0009049) that asso-

ciates(Peroneal muscle weakness with Peroneal muscle atrophy).In fact the per-

oneal muscle atrophy is characterized by wasting and ﬂaccid weakness of the

intrinsic muscles of the feet and of the muscles innervated by the peroneal nerve

[42].

Rule (7S) (HP:0010636, HP:0000316) relates (Schizencephaly, Hypertelorism)

involved in the same disease, the LEOPARD syndrome. A case study [43] re-

ported patient aﬀect by this disease with open-lip schizencephaly and Ocular

hypertelorism pathologic phenotype.

Instead Rule (8S) (HP:0009793, HP:0000316), highlights a link among Hy-

16

pertelorism) with (Presacral teratoma in the SchinzelGiedion syndrome as re-

ported in [44].

In [45] is discussed a Hereditary Congenital Posterior Dislocation of Radial

Heads which disorder is characterized by The association of nailpatella syn-

drome with typical antecubital pterygium as HPO-MINER found in Rule (9S)

(HP:0009760, HP:0006443),

Rule (10S) (HP:0008845, HP:0003067), composed by (Mesomelic short stature,

Madelung deformity). Both phenotype are involved in Madelung deformity of

childhood [46]

Here we analyze the rules contained in Table 4.

Rule (1Se) (HP:0200084, HP:0000007) associates Giant cell hepatitisand Au-

tosomal recessive inheritance. This evidence is highlighted in a case study re-

ported a patient suﬀered from a unique form of giant cell hepatitis which con-

dition appears to be an autosomal recessive one[47]

Rule (2Se) (HP:0100818, HP:0000774) Long thorax, Narrow chest is dis-

cussed above.

About the Rule (3Se) (HP:0100775, HP:0001537) i.e. Dural ectasia, humbil-

ical hernia HPO-MINER ﬁnd a association that is not conﬁrmed in literature.

The Rule (4Se) (HP:0100775, HP:0000494) and the Rule (5Se) (HP:0100775,

HP:0000316) associate the phenotypeDural ectasia withDownslanted palpebral

ﬁssures and Hypertelorism. Carrying out a analysis in the state of art, we found

a clinical case which report a patient with lateral meningocele syndrome (LMS)

aﬀected by both down slanting palpebral ﬁssures and hyperteloris [33].

About the Rule (6Se) (HP:0100626, HP:0000007) associates Chronic hepatic

failure to characteristic Autosomal recessive inheritance [48]

In the Rule (7Se) (HP:0030050, HP:0002524) are connected two pathologic

phenotype Narcolepsy and Cataplexy that are known as a sleep disorder associ-

17

ated with a centrally mediated hypocretin deﬁciency[49].

About Rule (8Se) (HP:0012240, HP:0000007) the evidence that the Increased

intramyocellular lipid droplets is Autosomal recessive inheritance.

The Rule (9Se) (HP:0010780, HP:0007018) associates the symptom Hyper-

acusis to Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as reported in[50]

Instead the Rule (10Se) (HP:0000179, HP:0010780) i.eShort 3rd metacarpal,

Hyperacusis has not evidence in literature.

Here we interpret the rule mined by HPO-Miner from the dataset Harispe

and contained in Table 3.

Rule (1H) is composed of terms (HP:0009577, HP:0004220) i.e., (Short mid-

dle phalanx of the 2nd ﬁnger, Short middle phalanx of the 5th ﬁnger). Analyz-

ing the literature, we found that this abnormalities have been observed in the

Adams-Oliver Syndrome as reported in the work of Kuster et.al. [51].

Rule (2H) contains the terms (HP:0010105, HP:0010034) i.e., Short ﬁrst

metatarsal, Short 1st metacarpal

Rule (3H) (HP:0000933,HP:0001305) i.e., Posterior fossa cyst at the fourth

ventricle Dandy-Walker malformation involved in abnormality that aﬀects brain

development.

Analyzing the literature has not been possible found any evidence on the

involvement of the (HP:0004704, HP:0004689) i.e., Short ﬁfth metatarsal, Short

fourth metatarsalRule, contained in the rule (4H) found by HPO-Miner.

Rule (5H) is formed by the two terms (HP:0001885, HP:0004209) i.e., Short

2nd toe, Clinodactyly of the 5th ﬁnger. Searching into the literature we found

that both symptoms occurred in Carpenter Syndromeas states in the work of

Gershoni et.al., [52].

Rule (6H) involves the following two HPO terms (HP:0003065, HP:0006443)

i.e., Patellar hypoplasia, Patellar aplasia. The work of Kaariainen et. al.

[53]

18

that RAPADILINO syndrome involve both symptoms.

Rule (7H) (HP:0009464, HP:0004209) i.e., Ulnar deviation of the 2nd ﬁn-

ger, Clinodactyly of the 5th ﬁnger consists of two terms involved in the KBG

syndrome as reported in the work of Sirmaci et. al. [54].

Rule (8H) is composed of (HP:0002834, HP:0002857) i.e., Flared femoral

metaphysis, Genu valgum. Both symptom are observed in the metatropic dwarﬁsm

as described into the work of LaRose et. al. [55].

The terms contained into the rule (9H) HP:0004209, HP:0000272 i.e., Clin-

odactyly of the 5th ﬁnger, Malar ﬂattening are involved in 49,XXXXY syndrome

as stated in the work of Peet et. al. [56].

About Rules (10H) (HP:0001773, HP:0004279) i.e. Short foot, Short palm

we didn’t ﬁnd any correlation between the terms, despite a depth research in

literature it was conducted.

19

Here we analyze the rules contained in Table 5.

The ﬁrst rule Rule (1Z) (HP:0002335, HP:0001305) associates the Congenital

absence of the vermis of cerebellum with Dandy Walker malformation. This ev-

idence is conﬁrmed in [57], that reported a cases of Dandy-Walker malformation

including agenesis cerebellar vermis.

HPO-MINER extracts the Rule (2Z) (HP:0003031, HP:0002986) i.eBending

of the diaphysis (shaft) of the ulna (Ulnar bowing) A bending or abnormal curva-

ture of the radius (Radial bowing) and the Rule (3Z) (HP:0000176, HP:0000193),

i.e.submucous clefts Hard-palate Biﬁd uvula. Although we conducted a deep

analysis of stare of art, these rules are not conﬁrmed in literature.

The Rule (4Z) (HP0001338 HP0002007) and the Rule (5Z) (HP0001338

HP0000494) associate the Partial agenesis of the corpus callosum to two abnor-

mal phenotype: Frontal Bossing and Downslated palpebral ﬁssures as conﬁrmed

in [58] and[59].

HPO-MINER ﬁnds the Rule (6Z) (HP:0000308, HP:0001305), Rule (8Z)

(HP:0010804, HP:0001305), Rule (9Z) (HP:0009623, HP:0001305) that asso-

ciate the phenotypesMicroretrognathia Tented upper lip vermilion in, Proximal

placement of the thumb toDandy Walker malformation. Unfortunately we didn’t

ﬁnd this evidences in literature.

About Rule (7Z) (HP:0000269, HP:0001305) and the Rule (10Z) (HP:0000567,

HP:0001305) Prominent occiput (HP:0010636 term) and the Chorioretinal colo-

boma (HP:0000567) are the abnormalities related to the Dandy Walker malfor-

mation as reported in [60] and [61].

5 Conclusion

We presented a new methodology based on weighted association rule for HPO

data analysis that takes into account the relevance of terms; the relevance is a

20

weight assigned to a term based on, for example, its speciﬁcity to describe a phe-

notypic abnormality. The relevance of a HPO term, is obtained by computing

the IC value related with each term. We presented the outline of an algorithm

called HPO-Miner to mine weighted itemsets that have suﬃcient weighted sup-

ports. These itemsets are used in turn to generate association rules that have

high weighted support. Finally, the relevance of the mined rules by HPO-Miner,

is proved by the evidences found analyzing the literature.
