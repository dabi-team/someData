LOW DIMENSIONAL ORDERS OF FINITE REPRESENTATION TYPE

DANIEL CHAN AND COLIN INGALLS

Abstract. In this paper, we study noncommutative surface singularities arising from orders. The singu-
larities we study are mild in the sense that they have ﬁnite representation type or, equivalently, are log
terminal in the sense of the Mori minimal model program for orders [CI05]. These were classiﬁed indepen-
dently by Artin (in terms of ramiﬁcation data) and Reiten-Van den Bergh (in terms of their AR-quivers).
The ﬁrst main goal of this paper is to connect these two classiﬁcations, by going through the ﬁnite subgroups
G ⊂ GL2, explicitly computing H 2(G, k∗), and then matching these up with Artin’s list of ramiﬁcation data
and Reiten-Van den Bergh’s AR-quivers. This provides a semi-independent proof of their classiﬁcations and
extends the study of canonical orders in [CHI09] to the case of log terminal orders. A secondary goal of
this paper is to study noncommutative analogues of plane curves which arise as follows. Let B = kζJx, yK
be the skew power series ring where ζ is a root of unity, or more generally a terminal order over a complete
local ring. We consider rings of the form A = B/(f ) where f ∈ Z(B) which we interpret to be the ring of
functions on a noncommutative plane curve. We classify those noncommutative plane curves which are of
ﬁnite representation type and compute their AR-quivers.

1. Introduction

The study of surface singularities is a classical topic related to group theory and Lie theory.

It has
prompted fascinating theories such as the McKay correspondence which connect these diﬀerent disciplines,
but it seems the correct setting for this requires one to broaden our study to include noncommutative surface
singularities which arise as 2-dimensional orders. These have now already been studied by many authors
including Artin, who classiﬁed maximal orders of ﬁnite representation type [Art87] in terms of ramiﬁcation
data, and Reiten-Van den Bergh, who more generally classiﬁed normal orders of ﬁnite representation type
in terms of their AR-quivers [RVdB89]. These orders were also studied in [DR94] and [LBVdBVO88]. In

joint work with Hacking [CHI09, Theorem 5.4], we showed that these are precisely the log terminal orders
on surfaces as deﬁned in the minimal model program for orders [CI05]. The ﬁrst goal of this paper is to
reprove and connect Artin and Reiten-Van den Bergh’s classiﬁcations by linking both to a classiﬁcation of
H 2(G, k∗). This, in particular, extends the detailed
pairs (G, η) where G is a ﬁnite subgroup of GL2 and η
study of canonical orders in [CHI09] to the case of log terminal orders. The second goal of this paper is to
study noncommutative analogues of plane curve singularities B/(f ) where B is a terminal kJu, vK-order such
as the skew power series ring kζ Jx, yK = k
Z(B).
We classify those of ﬁnite representation type and compute their AR-quivers.

The classiﬁcation of normal orders A of ﬁnite representation type is up to reﬂexive Morita equivalence.
As observed in [RVdB89], Section 5.3, any such A is reﬂexive Morita equivalent to a crossed product order
H 2(G, k∗). Our ﬁrst goal is to classify such
kJx, yK
pairs (G, η). The classiﬁcation of the subgroups G is classical and is described in several places. We will
follow Coxeter’s book [Cox91], which is based on Du Val [DV64]. The nonabelian groups are classiﬁed by
quadruples (ab, a : G1, G2) where G1 is a ﬁnite subgroup of SL2, and G2 is a normal subgroup with G1/G2
cyclic of order b and a is a positive integer (details are in Section 3). Roughly speaking, G is the quotient

This is done by using Bergman’s diamond lemma [Ber78] and spectral sequences to analyse group extensions.
The theory for this is set up in Section 4. The classiﬁcation does involve some case-by-case analysis, but
where possible, we have tried to avoid this.

Having classiﬁed pairs (G, η), we can connect this classiﬁcation with Reiten-Van den Bergh’s by computing
the AR-quivers of the skew group algebras kJx, yK
∗η G which are just the McKay quivers of the pair (G, η).
Recall that the AR-quivers appearing in [RVdB89] all have the form Z ∆/
where ∆ is an extended Dynkin
quiver and ρ is an automorphism of the associated translation quiver Z ∆. In Sections 5 and 6, we compute
formulas for ∆, ρ in terms of the data a, b, G1, G2. Note that [RVdB89] computes the possible relations on
the AR quivers and we do not compute the relations on the resulting McKay quivers. Fortunately there is
usually no choice for the relations, so they will be uniquely determined, but this not always the case.

The next goal is to connect the classiﬁcation of pairs (G, η) to Artin’s classiﬁcation of ramiﬁcation data. In
∗η G is given by η and the ramiﬁcation
principle, this is easy since the ramiﬁcation data associated to kJx, yK
Spec kJx, yKG. Of particular interest is the case where the
data of the quotient morphism Spec kJx, yK
centre kJx, yKG is smooth. The corresponding groups G are those generated by pseudo-reﬂections as classiﬁed
by Shephard-Todd [ST54]. In Section 7, we give an independent classiﬁcation of the possible ramiﬁcation
data when the centre is smooth by computing discrepancies and using the fact that normal orders of ﬁnite
representation type are precisely the log terminal ones.

−→

We end the paper by studying the aforementioned noncommutative plane curves B/(f ) where B is a
terminal order and f
= 0 is a non-unit in Z(B). To determine which ones have ﬁnite representation type
and compute their AR-quivers, we reformulate Kn¨orrer’s version of Eisenbud’s theory of matrix factorisation.
Here, the stable category of matrix factorisations is re-interpreted as the stable category MCM Λ of maximal
Cohen-Macaulay modules over the skew group algebra Λ = B[√f ]
f ) and the
generator of Z /2 acts by z
z. The category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay B/(f )-modules is equivalent
to MCM Λ and the point is that Λ is a 2-dimensional order so questions about ﬁnite representation type and
AR-quivers can now be answered easily with our results on log terminal orders. In particular, we see this
is one of the many instances where it is more natural to consider the noncommutative setting. Considering
matrix factorisations really takes us out of the commutative setting into the noncommutative setting of
orders. Similar constructions are used in [BFI17].

Note that specifying a noncommutative curve by giving the terminal order B and deﬁning equation f is
tantamount to giving the ramiﬁcation data of the auxiliary order Λ. Hence relating Artin’s classiﬁcation to
Reiten-Van den Bergh’s classiﬁcation is key to determining AR-quivers of noncommutative plane curves.
Notation: We let µm = µm(k) be the group of mth roots of unity in k. We will let ζm denote a choice of
generator of µm. If we need also introduce ζmn we will assume that it has been compatibly chosen, namely,
mn = ζm. For example, if k = C, we may as well let ζm = e2πi/m. Since in any particular question,
so that ζn
we will only ever deal with a ﬁnite number of roots of unity, this will not be a problem.

2. Background

The ﬁrst half of this paper is a continuation of the study of 2-dimensional complete local orders of
ﬁnite representation type studied, amongst others, by Artin [Art86], Reiten-Van den Bergh [RVdB89],
[LBVdBVO88], [DR94], and, more recently, in joint work with Hacking in [CHI09]. This section serves to
remind the reader of the most relevant material from these papers and place the results of this paper in
context. The reader can consult the ﬁrst four sections of [CHI09] for further details.

2.1. McKay quivers. Recall that given any group G and ﬁnite dimensional representation V , we can form
its McKay quiver McK(G, V ) whose vertices are the irreducible isomorphism classes of G-modules and the
number of arrows from a representation λ to λ′ is given by the multiplicity of λ′ in λ

To cater for orders with non-trivial Brauer class, we will need a mild generalisation of this concept. We
ﬁrst need to recall some basic results about k∗-universal central extensions as introduced by Schur, details
11E]. Consider the ﬁnite abelian cohomology group H 2(G, k∗) and its
of which can be found in [CR90,
dual H 2(G, k∗)∨. Let the top row, in the following morphism of central extensions, be a k∗-universal central
extension.

k∗ induces the central extension
Given any η
of G by k∗ in the bottom row and universality means that all such central extensions arise this way. The
group EG is a Schur cover of G. Note that the map η factors through its image µe < k∗, so
G is also induced
by a central extension of G by µe. In other words, η

H 2(G, k∗) is induced by an element of H 2(G, µe).

∈
We look now at the McKay quiver of (EG, V ). Since H 2(G, k∗)∨ is central in EG, it acts via a character
H 2(G, k∗) on any irreducible EG-module λ. We deﬁne the McKay quiver of (G, η) to be the full
G, V ) consisting of these vertices. These vertices of course can be identiﬁed
G-modules where k∗ acts by scalar multiplication. We will

Furthermore, if V is a faithful representation, then the McKη(G, V ) are connected components.

Proof. First, note that the McKη(G, V ) are disjoint for if λ is a vertex in McKη(G, V ), then H 2(G, k∗)∨
acts on λ
V via η too. It thus suﬃces to show that McKη(G, V ) is connected under the assumption that
V is faithful. To this end, let λ, λ′ be representations in McKη(G). We need to show that there exists a
non-negative integer i such that

Let R be more generally, a complete local Cohen-Macaulay commutative ring and Λ be an R-algebra
which is ﬁnitely generated as an R-module and has centre R. We say that a ﬁnitely generated Λ-module M
is maximal Cohen-Macaulay if it is maximal Cohen-Macaulay as an R-module, that is depthRM = dim R.
We say that Λ has ﬁnite representation type if (up to isomorphism) the number of indecomposable maximal
Cohen-Macaulay modules is ﬁnite.

e

We will initially be interested in the case where R is a 2-dimensional (commutative) complete local normal
domain R with ﬁeld of fractions K. In this case, the maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules are precisely the
reﬂexive modules. Recall that an R-order is an R-algebra A such that i) A is a ﬁnitely generated torsion-free
R-module and ii) K
⊗R A is a central simple algebra. We say A is normal if it is reﬂexive as an R-module
and further, satisﬁes the following analogue of Serre’s regularity in codimension one condition.

(i) For any height one prime P ⊳ R, the localisation AP is hereditary and,
(ii) the Jacobson radical radAP is a principal left and right ideal.

Dropping condition ii) above leads to the notion of tame orders as studied by Reiten-Van den Bergh
[RVdB89]. The crossed product orders above provide the most important example of normal orders for
this paper. The reason is the following result. Auslander-Reiten (AR) quivers are deﬁned in Chapter 5
of [Yos90] or [RVdB89].

Theorem 2.3. [RVdB89, Theorem 5.6] Every tame order A of ﬁnite representation type is reﬂexive Morita
equivalent to a crossed product algebra of the form kJx, yK
∗η G some pair (G, η) as above. In particular, A
∗η G have the same AR-quivers.
and kJx, yK
Recall that given a representation ρ : G

G is
equivalent to the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on the stack [Spec kJx, yK/G]. Conversely, by [AV02,
Lemma 2.2.3], any smooth complete local Deligne-Mumford stack of dimension two has this form. By
complete local, we mean here that the coarse moduli scheme is the spectrum of a complete local ring. Now
Maschke’s theorem tells us that kJx, yK
G has global dimension two. Hence from Lemma 2.2, we know that
it is a product of tame orders of ﬁnite representation type. The theory of smooth Deligne-Mumford stacks
is thus intimately related to the theory of tame orders of ﬁnite representation type.

2.3. Ramiﬁcation Data. The background for this material can be read in [Cha11, CI05, GI16]. The theory
of ramiﬁcation for orders is most naturally presented in the context of normal orders. Let A be a normal
R-order. The ramiﬁcation or discriminant locus of A is the codimension one locus of the closed subset
D
Spec R where A is not Azumaya. Given any ramiﬁcation curve C, that is, irreducible component of D
say corresponding to the prime P ⊳ R, we can deﬁne the ramiﬁcation index of A at C to be

⊂

eC := dimR/P Z(AP /rad AP ).

LOW DIMENSIONAL ORDERS OF FINITE REPRESENTATION TYPE

−→

The ramiﬁcation indices of A = kJx, yK
∗η G are the same as that of the morphism of commutative schemes
Spec kJx, yKG, and these in turn are the orders of the inertia groups of G acting on
Spec kJx, yK
Spec kJx, yK. Indeed, from the theory of orders, we know that eC is the integer such that (rad AP )eC = P AP
where P ⊳kJx, yKG is the prime corresponding to C. Let Q⊳kJx, yKP be semiprime such that Qe = P kJx, yKP .
Now kJx, yKP /Q

∗η G is a separable algebra so rad AP = QAP and we conclude e = eC as desired.

Ramiﬁcation data give a natural way of associating a log surface to a normal order A. We deﬁne the

boundary divisor

∆A =

XC

1
(cid:18)

−

eC (cid:19)

C

and deﬁne Log(A) := (Spec Z(A), ∆A) to be the log surface associated to A. Note that Log(A) only depends
on the reﬂexive Morita equivalence class of A. This is because ramiﬁcation data is determined by codimension
one data, and reﬂexive Morita equivalence corresponds to a Morita equivalence on the punctured spectrum
of R.

In [CI05], we introduced a version of Mori’s minimal model program for orders on surfaces. We will
not reproduce the deﬁnition of discrepancy for orders (see [CI05, Deﬁnition 3.13]) from which follow the
deﬁnitions of terminal, canonical and log terminal orders. It suﬃces for now to note the following result.

Theorem 2.4. [CI05, Proposition 3.15] [CHI09, Theorem 5.4] The following are equivalent conditions on a
normal order A.

(i) A has ﬁnite representation type.
(ii) A is log terminal.
(iii) (Spec Z(A), ∆A) is a log terminal log surface.

In light of the above result, it is natural to ask the following question.

Question 2.5. Let R be a complete local k-algebra of dimension two and let ∆ be a divisor on Spec R with
1. If we suppose that (Spec R, ∆) is log
standard coeﬃcients, i.e. of the form (1
k[[x, y]]G and ∆ is the

3. The classification of subgroups of GL2

In this section, we recall Coxeter’s description of ﬁnite subgroups of GL2 as well as Shephard-Todd’s
descriptions of ﬁnite groups generated by pseudo-reﬂections. We start with the former and consider G < GL2.
Scalar multiplication of matrices induces a double cover of groups π : k∗
GL2 so it suﬃces to
1(G). Now the ﬁnite subgroups of k∗ are all of the form µm for some
classify the double covers

H 2(G, k∗) and the corresponding central extensions. Our criterion for “nice”, is one which removes as much
case-by-case analysis as possible, and facilitates the computation of the McKay quiver (see Section 5). One
natural approach is to use the fact that G ﬁts in an exact sequence of the form

where G is a cyclic group of order say n and H has simpler group cohomology than G. Then one can appeal
to the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence

To make this work, we have to properly understand this sequence and especially, the diﬀerentials d2, d3. We
devote this section towards this goal. Note ﬁrst that the spectral sequence gives an exact sequence

where H 1(G, H ∨)d2=0 denotes ker(d2 : H 1(G, H ∨)
H 3(G, H 0(H, k∗)) and similarly for the second last

term. From Section 3, we may choose H to be a subgroup of SL2 so H 2(H, k∗) = 0 and a natural question
is how to write the central extension of G given a 1-cocycle representing an element of H 1(G, H ∨)d2=0.

McKay quivers of small subgroups of GL2 were computed in [AR86, Section 2].

In this section, we
reformulate their setup and pave the way for computing McKay quivers of general pairs (G, η) in the next
section. The relevance of McKay quivers for us is the following result, which is well known when η is trivial.

1 acts trivially and the other ones the odd vertices. Then ∆H is bipartite with

It was shown in [RVdB89] that AR-quivers of log terminal orders can be described as quotients of Z ∆
∆H rather than Z ∆.
It is best to describe these automorphisms in terms of Z
by an automorphism.
×
They can be gotten by the product of an automorphism of Z with an automorphism of ∆H . The only
automorphisms of the quiver Z come from addition by n
Z which we will denote by [+n]. There are two
natural ways to obtain automorphisms of ∆H . Given a one dimensional representation χ of H, tensoring
by χ permutes the irreducible representations and so induces an automorphism of ∆H . We will call such
an automorphism of ∆H the character automorphism associated to χ, or sometimes somewhat ambiguously,
associated to ker χ. Another automorphism comes from considering a ﬁnite subgroup of G < GL2 which
contains H as a normal subgroup. For any g
G, the outer automorphism of H deﬁned by conjugation by
g induces an automorphism of ∆H . If g generates the group G/H then we will say this automorphism is an
outer automorphism associated to G. When G/H is order two, then this is uniquely determined so we may
speak of the outer automorphism associated to G. It is a good exercise in group theory to show that these
character and outer automorphisms generate all automorphisms of the quiver ∆H .

The following is a uniform statement of [AR86, Proposition 7], giving the McKay quiver of a group. We
include their proof as it will be referred to later. Below as usual, we use Coxeter’s notation for subgroups
of GL2 as recalled in Section 3.

to isomorphism, only one choice for these relations.
In type A, the relation is either uniquely
determined, or depends on a parameter ζ which is a root of unity in k. It would be an interesting
exercise to determine ζ as a function of the (G, η) in this case.

7. Log terminal kJu, vK-orders

In this section, we classify log terminal orders with smooth centre via ramiﬁcation data. We do this
directly by computing discrepancies as opposed to appealing to Shephard-Todd’s classiﬁcation of ﬁnite
groups generated by pseudo-reﬂections. We then elucidate the correspondence between ﬁnite subgroups of
GL2 and the possible ramiﬁcation data of log terminal orders.

We work more generally with a log surface (Spec kJu, vK, ∆) where ∆ has standard coeﬃcients in the sense
1/ei for some positive integer ei which we call the

We will usually write the ramiﬁcation indices e1, e2, . . . , em with multiplicity equal to the multiplicity of the

We say that positive integers a, b, c form a Platonic triple if 1/a + 1/b + 1/c > 1 so this holds in particular,
in the degenerate case where one of the integers is 1.

Below we use the basic theory and deﬁntions of the minimal model program as found in [KM98].

In

particular, klt stands for Kawamata log terminal as deﬁned in [KM98, Defn. 2.34].

case iv), C′ is the union of two possibly tangential curves, whilst in in case v), it is a cusp. We construct a

In this section, we determine the ramiﬁcation of the log terminal order kJx, yK

∗η G and hence match up
our classiﬁcation of pairs (G, η) with Artin’s classiﬁcation of ramiﬁcation data. We begin by determining
an eﬃcient way of computing the subgroup of G = (ab, a; G1, G2) generated by pseudo-reﬂections. Let

DANIEL CHAN AND COLIN INGALLS

The reﬂection subgroups of abelian subgroups were already noted in Section 3.
Remark: In Artin’s classiﬁcation of ramiﬁcation data of maximal orders of ﬁnite representation type,
he lists the possible centres in the form kJs, tKG0 by listing the groups G0. Also, rather than describing the
ramiﬁcation loci and indices on kJs, tKG0, he describes their pullback to kJs, tK. Our results allow us also to
describe the ramiﬁcation data of kJx, yK
∗η G in this format. Indeed, the group G0 is just the quotient group
G/RG whilst the pullback of the ramiﬁcation data to kJs, tKG0 is the ramiﬁcation associated to RG listed
in Section 7. Note that since Artin assumes his orders are maximal, there are fewer possibilities than what
we ﬁnd. For example, his group G0 is always cyclic, whereas we have seen that this may not be the case
when G = Bm
n .

9. Kn¨orrer’s method

In this section, we review Kn¨orrer’s reformulation [Kn¨o87] of Eisenbud’s theory of matrix factorisations
in our noncommutative setting. It allows us to relate the question of ﬁnite representation type of noncom-
mutative plane curves to a similar question about 2-dimensional orders.

Let R be a complete local commutative Cohen-Macaulay ring and Λ be an R-algebra which is ﬁnitely
generated as an R-module and has centre R. We let MCM Λ denote the category of maximal Cohen-
Macaulay Λ-modules. We will say that Λ is a regular R-algebra if furthermore, R is regular local, Λ is free
as an R-module and gl.dim Λ = dim R. We have the following version of the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula
from [IW14, Lemma 2.16].

Proposition 9.1. Let Λ be a regular R-algebra. Then for any ﬁnitely generated Λ-module M we have

thus form the skew group ring Λ := B[√f ]
Λ which we note is an
idempotent. Now B[√f ]
ε) is a Cohen-Macaulay Λ-module so we may also consider the quotient
Λ(1
category MCM Λ = (MCM Λ)/
. We will denote homomorphism and endomorphism groups in this
i
category with Hom, End respectively. The theory of matrix factorisations `a la Eisenbud [Eis80, Chapter 6]
and Kn¨orrer’s method [Kn¨o87, Proposition 2.1] carry over to our setting painlessly. We will use the following
re-interpretation, which is also used in [BFI17].

Lemma 9.3. Let B be a normal, regular R-order. If A := B/(f ) has ﬁnite representation type, then A has
no non-zero nilpotent ideals. In particular, the subscheme Cf : f = 0
Spec R deﬁnes a reduced subscheme
of Spec R which does not contain any components of the ramiﬁcation locus of B.

⊂

Proof. Suppose A has ﬁnite representation type. Then Auslander’s Theorem [Aus86, Section 1, Theorem,
p. 9] ensures that A is an isolated singularity, that is, for each height one prime P ⊳ R/(f ), the localisation
AP is regular and thus semisimple. If A had a non-zero nilpotent ideal, then the same would be true of
some AP , a contradiction. We may thus assume that f = 0 deﬁnes reduced subscheme of Spec R. Let Q ⊳ R
be a prime over which B ramiﬁes say with ramiﬁcation index e. From ramiﬁcation theory, we know that
rad BQ is nilpotent modulo Q. It follows that Q does not divide f .(cid:3)
(rad BQ)e = QBQ so the ideal I = B

In the light of the previous lemma, it makes sense to consider

Hypothesis 9.4. Let B be a normal, regular kJu, vK-order. Suppose further Cf : f = 0
Spec kJu, vK
deﬁnes a reduced curve and that it does not contain any of the ramiﬁcation curves of the R-order B. This
ensures in particular that Λ := B[√f ]

The regular orders B of interest for us in this paper, are the terminal orders introduced in [CI05]. As
mentioned in Section 2, these are deﬁned via a version of discrepancy for orders. In the complete local case,
these terminal orders have been classiﬁed as follows. Let ζ be a primitive e-th root of unity and kζ Jx, yK be
ζxy). It has centre kJu, vK where u = xe, v = ye. For any positive

Theorem 9.5. Let B be a full matrix algebra over Be,ne.

(i) B is a terminal kJu, vK-order and, in particular, regular.

indices are e, ne.

Note that when e = 1 and n > 1 the orders Be,ne are ramiﬁed over a single line. We also recall that
surfaces have terminal singularities if and only if they are smooth [KM98, Thm. 4.5(1)]. We further note
that having terminal ramiﬁcation data implies that a reﬂexive order has global dimension two and is a
full matrix algebra over Be,ne [CI05, Thm. 2.12]. For these reasons, we interpret terminal kJu, vK-order
as noncommutative analogues of complete local smooth surfaces Spec kJu, vK. This motivates the following
deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 9.6. A noncommutative plane curve is an algebra of the form B/(f ) where B is a terminal
kJu, vK-order and f

Our discussion leads to the following

Then A has ﬁnite representation type if and only if (Spec kJu, vK, ∆) is a log terminal surface as classiﬁed

10. Noncommutative plane curves

In [GK85], Greuel-Kn¨orrer showed that the plane curves of ﬁnite representation type (in the complete local
case) are precisely the simple singularities. All complete local commutative orders of ﬁnite representation
type are classiﬁed in [Jac67, DR67], and these are known to lie between the simple plane curve singularities
and their integral closures. In this section, we wish to extend this result by ﬁrst classifying noncommutative
plane curves of ﬁnite representation type. We continue by computing their AR-quivers as subquivers of
corresponding log terminal orders.

We note that local orders over commutative complete discrete valuation rings of ﬁnite representation type
are classiﬁed in [HN97] building on work of [DK73]. The Auslander-Reiten quivers of Gorenstein orders of
ﬁnite representation type are classiﬁed in [Wie87], which has been improved in [Luo15]. There are also
interesting classiﬁcations of B¨ackstr¨om orders of ﬁnite representation type and their quivers in [RR79], and
tiled orders due to Zavadskii-Kirchenko [ZK77], and summarized in [Sim92, Ch.13.2,Thm.13.9]. We do not
address how our classiﬁcation interacts with the classiﬁcations cited above. It would be interesting to study
this.

We continue the notation from the previous section. Let B be a terminal R-order where R = kJu, vK.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that B = Be,ne since we are only interested in facts up to Morita

To answer this question, we need to use the theory of Artin covers as introduced in [Art86]. We refer the
reader unfamiliar with this concept, to the exposition given in [CHI09, Section 3]. Suﬃce for now to note
that given an order Λ with R = Z(Λ) and ramiﬁed Galois cover S/R whose ramiﬁcation indices ri divide
the corresponding ramiﬁcation indices ei of Λ, there is a naturally associated S-order Γ, called the Artin
cover such that the following hold:

(i) There is an extension of the G action from S to Γ such that ΓG = Λ.
(ii) The ramiﬁcation indices of Γ are ei/ri. In particular, Γ is Azumaya in codimension one if all the

ri = ei.

The case where B is ramiﬁed on L : v = 0 only and Cf is a smooth curve intersecting L with multiplicity
two was shown to be ﬁnite representation type in [CC15]. Indeed, in that case, the indecomposable Cohen-
Macaulay modules were explicitly computed without use of the McKay quiver.

We present some of the McKay graphs of ﬁnite subgroups of GL2.
