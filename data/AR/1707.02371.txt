ABSTRACT

Here, we developed a complex network of solar active regions (ARs) to study various local and global

properties of the network. The values of the Hurst exponent (0.8 − 0.9) were evaluated by both the

detrended ﬂuctuation analysis and the rescaled range analysis applied on the time series of the AR

numbers. The ﬁndings suggest that ARs can be considered as a system of self-organized criticality.

We constructed a growing network based on locations, occurrence times, and the lifetimes of 4,227

ARs recorded from 1 January 1999 to 14 April 2017. The behaviour of the clustering coeﬃcient shows

that the ARs network is not a random network. The logarithmic behaviour of the length scale has

the characteristics of a so-called “small-world network”. It is found that the probability distribution

of the node degrees for undirected networks follows the power-law with exponents of about 3.7 to 4.2.

This indicates the scale-free nature of the ARs network. The scale-free and small-world properties

of the ARs network conﬁrm that the system of ARs forms a system of self-organized criticality. Our

results show that the occurrence probability of ﬂares (classiﬁed by GOES class C > 5, M, and X

ﬂares) in the position of the ARs network hubs take values greater than that obtained for other

1. INTRODUCTION

Solar active regions (ARs) are the origin of various energetic phenomena. It is believed that solar

ﬂares and coronal mass ejections are direct results of the changes in the topology and structure of

the ARs’ magnetic ﬁeld (Priest & Forbes 2002; Aschwanden 2005). Because of the important role of

ARs in solar activity, numerous attempts have been made to study the statistical properties of ARs

(K¨unzel 1959; Howard 1989, 2000; Sammis et al. 2000; Leka & Barnes 2003; Georgoulis & Rust 2007;

Schrijver 2007; Falconer et al. 2008; Mason & Hoeksema 2010; Falconer et al. 2011; Georgoulis et al.

2012; Abramenko 2015; Arish et al. 2016; Barnes et al. 2016; Raboonik et al. 2017). Zhang et al.

(2010) studied both the statistical (e.g. the frequency distribution of size and magnetic ﬂux) and

physical properties of 1,730 ARs detected from 1996 to 2008. The information (occurrence times

and locations on solar disk) about ARs and sunspots are recorded by the Royal Observatory of

Belgium (ROB), the Solar Inﬂuences Data Analysis Center (SIDC), and the National Oceanic and

Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In the NOAA catalog, each AR has a unique identiﬁcation

number. There is important evidence to suggest that systems of solar events such as ﬂares, bright

points, and so on are in a self-organized criticality (SOC) (Zhang et al. 2001; Alipour & Safari 2015;

Aschwanden et al. 2016). Aschwanden (2013) provided an extended review on SOC in solar physics

and astrophysics. de Arcangelis et al. (2006) studied the universality properties of both solar ﬂares

and earthquakes. They showed that both phenomena follow the same law for the size distribution and

inter-occurrence times. Also, they interpreted the temporal power-law dependency of the afterﬂare

sequence as the Omori law for earthquakes.

The complex network is an approach to study eﬀectively large complex systems (e.g. earthquakes,

bulk electrical power systems, computers, the brain, and social systems). This approach explains

signiﬁcant characteristics of complex systems using network representations that have their roots

in mathematical studies and are known as the graph theory.

In most studies, a network or its

equivalent graph is considered as a collection of some nodes together with edges while modeling

a network (Newman 2003; Humphries & Gurney 2008; Rubinov & Sporns 2010; Lotﬁ & Darooneh

2012, 2013; Rezaei et al. 2017). Probability theory is a useful tool for interpreting the details of

4

Daei, Safari, and Dadashi

the complexity of the networks. The scale-free and small-world networks are the two main complex

networks that have been widely used to study large complex systems (e.g. Watts & Strogatz 1998;

Amaral et al. 2000; Barab´asi & Bonabeau 2003; Kim & Wilhelm 2008; Buldyrev et al. 2010). Small-

world networks are basically intersections of the random and regular networks.

In these kinds of

networks, the length scale behaviour is the same as in the random networks, but with a high average in

the clustering coeﬃcient (Watts & Strogatz 1998). The quantitative measurement of the small-world

property can be computed by diﬀerent methods–all comparing the network’s parameters with the

parameters of an equivalent random or regular network (Humphries & Gurney 2008; Telesford et al.

2011). Humphries & Gurney (2008) presented a measure for the small-world property of a network by

comparing both its length scale and clustering coeﬃcient with an equivalent random network. This

factor is employed in many articles, especially in the ﬁeld of neuroscience (Bullmore & Sporns 2009).

However, Telesford et al. (2011) explained that the Humphries method cannot correctly recognize

the small-world networks. They introduced a new factor, using the length scale of a random network

and the clustering coeﬃcient of a regular network to evaluate the small-world property of a network.

In this paper, we construct a network for the ARs using their locations, occurrence times, and

lifetimes. We compute the length scale, clustering coeﬃcient, and degree distribution of nodes for

the network. We describe important properties of the ARs network in the category of scale-free and

small-world networks.

The details are discussed as follows: Section 2 introduces the data set. In Section 3, the application

of both detrended ﬂuctuation and rescaled range (R/S) analysis on the time series of ARs is explained.

Sections 4 and 5 describe the construction of ARs networks and their properties. Sections 6 and 7

present the results and conclusions, respectively.

2. DATA PROCESSING

The solar monitor (www.solarmonitor.org) records the solar data observed by several solar space

observatories and missions (e.g. GOES, GONG, ACE, STEREO, SDO, etc.).

SolarMonitor.org provides daily tables for ARs that occur on the main-side of the sun. The daily

tables include the unique identiﬁcation NOAA numbers, sunspot areas, Hale and McIntosh classi-

ARs Complex Network

5

ﬁcations, produced ﬂares, and the number of spots (Gallagher et al. 2002). The AR positions are

tabulated daily in both the heliographic (in latitude and longitude) and heliocentric (in arcsec) coor-

dinates. The needed information of 4,227 ARs during 1 January 1999 to 14 April 2017 for building

the ARs network are the NOAA numbers, rotated positions, occurrence times, and lifetimes. By

tracking the NOAA numbers in daily tables, the lifetimes and positions of the ARs are extracted.

The appendix of this paper contains a table that includes the NOAA numbers, dates, and positions in

the heliographic coordinates (longitudes and latitudes) for 4,227 ARs. Using the diﬀ rot code in the

SunPy software (SunPy Community et al. 2015), the locations of the ARs are rotated with respect

to the ﬁrst occurrence time of the reference AR (NOAA 8419). For more simplicity, we used the

location of the ARs at their ﬁrst occurrence time during their lifetimes (on the main-side). In Figure

1, the rotated positions at the ﬁrst occurrence time of 4,227 ARs in the front and far hemispheres

are presented. The rotated positions of ARs (longitudes (ϕ) and latitudes (θ)) are restricted to the

range of 0◦ − 360◦ and 0◦ − 180◦, respectively.

Using the GOES ﬂare catalog ( ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/space-weather/solar-data/solar-features/solar-flares/x-rays/goes/xrs/),

we identify ARs including energetic ﬂares (C>5, M, and X class) during 1 January 1999 to 14 April

2017.

3. HURST EXPONENT

The Hurst exponent is a key parameter to measure the auto correlation (self-dependency) of the

time series. Both the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) (Mandelbrot 1975; Peng et al. 1994;

Weron 2002; Alipour & Safari 2015) and R/S analysis (Buldyrev et al. 1995; Weron 2011) are useful

tools to study the self-aﬃnity (temporal dependency) in the time series of ARs (Figure 2). In order to

compute the Hurst exponent, the time series of ARs x(t) with length T is divided into adjacent sub-

time series of length P while T=mP. Each sub-time series is labeled by xj

i (ti) (i = 1, ..., P, j = 1, ..., m).

For each sub-time series, the rescaled range (R/S) is computed by

(R/S)j =

The Hurst exponent (H) can be obtained by a linear ﬁt (in a log-log scale) for F(P) versus P.

DFA and R/S analyses are used to extract the value of the Hurst exponent (H) to investigate

the behaviour of the time series.

In the analysis of time series based on the value of the Hurst

exponent (H), if 0 < H < 0.5 and 0.5 < H < 1, we can say the time series has long temporal

negative and positive correlations, respectively. If H equals to 0.5, the time series is uncorrelated

(white noise) (Buldyrev et al. 1995). By applying the DFA and R/S on the time series of ARs, the

values of the Hurst exponent are obtained as 0.8 and 0.94, respectively. These values show that the

time series of ARs has a long temporal dependency and suggest that the system of ARs is one of

SOC (Carreras et al. 2001; Dobson et al. 2007; Alipour & Safari 2015). SOC is an important way to

describe the complex nature of a high degree of freedom and non-linearity in many physical and astro-

physical phenomena (e.g. Bak et al. 1987; Tang & Bak 1988; Wang & Dai 2013; Aschwanden et al.

2016)

In the remainder of this paper, we study the behaviour of the SOC of the ARs system in the

framework of the complex network.

4. ACTIVE REGIONS NETWORK

The information of 4,227 recorded ARs is used to construct a complex network concerning the

following steps:

– The solar spherical surface is divided into N ×N cells with equal areas considering the spherical

coordinates (θ, ϕ) as Aı, = 4π

N 2 R2

⊙ , ı,  = 1..N, where the parameter R⊙ is the solar radius.

, ϕ1 = 0,
cos(θ+1) = cos(θ) − 1
N

, θ1 = 0.

(3)

– The ARs are assigned to cells according to their locations at their ﬁrst occurrence times rotated

with respect to the ﬁrst occurrence time of the reference AR (NOAA 8419) (Figure 1). To avoid

more complexity in our analysis, the variations on the latitudes and longitudes of ARs during

their lifetimes are ignored. Cells with no ARs are removed from our network analysis. However,

the remaining ones are used as the nodes of the network, indicated by nℓ (ℓ = 1..L).

– An edge connects the node ni to nj if an AR appears at node (cell) nj during the lifetime of

another AR at node ni. A loop (connecting node ni to itself) is formed when an AR appears

during the lifetime of another one within the same cell. In Figure 3, a small part of the ARs

network with six nodes, 15 edges, and four loops is shown. This graph presents a sample of our

network, which contains the information of 33 ARs. The AR NOAA 10081 is formed during

the lifetime of AR NOAA 10063; therefore, in our network, the node number 680 is connected

to the node that is labeled by 557. Also, the AR NOAA 9805 appeared in the lifetime of AR

NOAA 9794 at the same node (681); so, a loop is created.

– We organize a directed and weighted network as an L × L adjacency matrix (A′). In order

to analyze the properties of the ARs network, A′ is converted to a symmetric matrix with all

diagonal elements equal to zero, which is representative of the undirected, unweighted, and

self-loop-free graph.

5. NETWORK PARAMETERS

A graph that consists of nodes and edges is a mathematical representation of a network. In general,

a graph can be categorized into a directed or an undirected and a weighted or an unweighted graph

depending on its edges. A directed network or its equivalent graph is deﬁned by a set of nodes

including directed connections (edges). A graph with bi-directional edges is called an undirected

8

Daei, Safari, and Dadashi

graph. A graph with diﬀerent real numbers assigned to its edges is named a weighted network. The

unweighted ones are those for which all the weights are set to be equal to one or the edges have no

number assigned to them. In the complex network approach, using the adjacency matrix made for

a graph, the topological properties in both the local and global scales were studied (Steen 2010). In

the present section, we brieﬂy review some network parameters.

In order to characterize a graph, one can use an adjacency matrix (A′), including information

about edges and nodes. The adjacency matrix is an L × L matrix in which the element a′

i,j is the
number of edges (i.e. weight of edge) connecting node ni to node nj. In this way, the sum of ith

row elements represents the outbound edges from the node ni (outbound degree) and the sum of

the ith column elements represents the number of inbound edges to the node (inbound degree). The

diagonal elements represent self-loop(s) of nodes (i.e. a node connecting to itself by an edge). For

a simple undirected and unweighted graph, the adjacency matrix is a symmetric matrix with all

elements equal to zero or one. Undirected and unweighted adjacency matrices are used to determine

the characteristics of the ARs network, including the average of local clustering coeﬃcients, mean of

shortest path length, diameter, and the nodes’ degree of probability distribution function.

To convert the network to an unweighted, undirected, and loop-free network, the diagonal elements

of the adjacency matrix are set to zero and every non-zero element is replaced by one. Then, the

new adjacency matrix (A) is symmetrized.

The local clustering coeﬃcients (cı) and clustering coeﬃcient (C) are computed using the adjacency

matrix A:

ci =

C =

P
1
L

j,ℓ6=i ai,jaj,ℓaℓ,i

ci,

i=1

(5)

where ki and L are the number of edges connected to the ith node and the total number of nodes,

respectively.

The average of the shortest path between all pairs of nodes is another interesting parameter of the

network, expressed as:

ls =

Xi,j=1,i6=j
where di,j is the shortest path length between i and j nodes.

L(L − 1)

L

di,j,

(6)

The parameter di,j is computed using Floyd–Warshall algorithm (Floyd 1962), which is an eﬃcient

method to ﬁnd the length of the shortest path between all nodes in a graph. The largest value of

the shortest paths is called the diameter of a graph. Another interesting property of a network is

the probability distribution function (PDF) of the nodes’ degree, which determines the probability

of ﬁnding a node with a certain degree.

In this study, we refer to some properties of such well-known networks as regular, random, small-

world, and scale-free networks.

In regular graphs with all nodes having the same degree, typically the clustering coeﬃcient and

shortest path length possess large values. A network is called random if all pairs of nodes are

connected with the same probability (Erdos & R´enyi 1960). A random graph, in comparison with a

regular one, has smaller values for both the clustering coeﬃcient and the shortest path length. For

a random network, the average values of the shortest path length (lsrand) and clustering coeﬃcient

(Crand) can be obtained by the following equations:

ln(Lrand) − γ
ln < k >

lsrand =
Crand ≃ Erand

,

L2

rand

+

,

(7)

(8)

where Erand, Lrand, < k >, and γ = 0.5772 are the number of nodes, number of edges, average degree of

nodes, and Euler constant, respectively (Fronczak et al. 2004). One can build a random graph using

a model proposed by Erdos & R´enyi (1960). The intersection of the random and regular graphs is

called a small-world graph (Watts & Strogatz 1998). A small-world graph has a small average shortest

path. However, the clustering coeﬃcient takes the larger value. We can ﬁnd enough examples of such

graphs in nature–for instance, in the brainstem reticular network (Humphries et al. 2005), human

10

Daei, Safari, and Dadashi

protein network (Stelzl et al. 2005), and power grid network (Mei et al. 2011). Bullmore & Sporns

(2009) reviewed the small-world networks in neurosciences. In some small-world networks (e.g. the

brainstem reticular network), the PDF of the nodes’ degree (P(k)) follows a power-law, P (k) ∝ k−γ.

This kind of network is representative of scale-free events.

6. RESULTS

In order to construct a complex network for the solar ARs, the locations and dates of the ﬁrst

occurrence times, and the lifetimes of 4,227 ARs were used (Section 4). The nodes of network was

created by dividing the solar surface into equal area cells. The adjacency matrix was prepared for

both the directed and undirected ARs networks. The weighted adjacency matrix was determined

using directed connections (edges) between the pair of ARs. Loops, the connections between two

successive ARs occurring at the same cell (node), were considered as the diagonal elements of the

adjacency matrix (a′

i,i). The empty cells of the directed and weighted adjacency matrix were removed

from our network analysis. The eﬀect of the network size (the number of nodes, L) on the shortest

path length, clustering coeﬃcient, and probability distribution of the nodes’ degree are studied. An

equivalent random network was constructed corresponding to the ARs network with the same size

and edges.

The clustering coeﬃcients of the ARs networks and their equivalent random networks (with the

same number of nodes and edges) are shown in Figure 4. The size of the networks varies from 54

to 2,693 (nodes). The clustering coeﬃcient for the ARs and random networks are computed by Eqs.

(4) and (7), respectively. It is found that the clustering coeﬃcient of the ARs network is noticeably

greater than the equivalent random network by about a factor of two or more.

In Figure 5, the length scale of the ARs network versus the size (logarithm) of the network is

plotted. For small size of the ARs networks (L < 500) most of the nodes are connected together and

the networks tend to the complete graphs. For the networks with size 500-2,700 a linear ﬁtting was

applied and the slope of the ﬁt was obtained (ls = 0.79 log10 L). According to the small values of

the length scale and its logarithmic dependency on the size, we conclude that the ARs network is

classiﬁed as a small-world network.

Figure 6 presents the PDF of the nodes’ degree for the undirected networks with the size varying

from 1,687 to 2,693. The lower ends of the degree distributions (k < ktrunc) suﬀer from some

truncation eﬀects due to incomplete detection of small ARs and far-side ARs, therefore should not

be considered in the power-law ﬁtting. The truncated power-law (p(k) ∼ k−γ) ﬁtting was carried out

on the probability distribution of the nodes’ degree (Aschwanden 2015). The values of the power-

law exponent range from 3.7 to 4.2. The power-law nature of the PDF indicates that a few nodes

have high connectivity values. In the context of the complex network, nodes with a large number of

connections are named hubs of the network (Albert & Barab´asi 2002). One may ask: What is the

criterion for selecting a node as a hub? In a network, nodes with degrees higher than a threshold

are considered as hubs. The threshold is deﬁned as the maximum degree of nodes in the equivalent

random network.

We found that for the ARs network with 1,986 nodes, there are 53 hubs with degrees larger than

80. On increasing the network size to 2,693 nodes, 78 hubs with connections larger than 61 are

found. In Figure 7, the relation between the average number of large energetic ﬂares (C> 5, M, and

X classes) appearing at the position of the ARs network nodes is presented. The average number

of ﬂares increases with an increase in the degree of the nodes. The average number of large ﬂares

appearing at the position of the ARs network hubs is larger than the other nodes by at least a factor

of two. In Figure 8, the dependency of the averaged local clustering coeﬃcient ( ¯C) for the nodes with

the same degree is presented.The threshold power-law( ¯C ∼ (k + kth)−γ) is ﬁtted to the average local

clustering coeﬃcient in which kth is the threshold value. Aschwanden (2015) modeled the threshold

power-law for size distributions of some natural phenomena (e.g., solar and stellar ﬂares, etc.). They

show that in most size distributions of detected data, the threshold power-laws are signiﬁcantly well

ﬁtted. We found that by increasing the size of the network, the power-law exponent of the average

clustering coeﬃcient slightly exceeds the value one.

7. CONCLUSION

Typically, 220 ARs can be observed on the solar disk each year. Within some of the ARs, large-scale

magnetic phenomena such as ﬂares and coronal mass ejections are stochastically emerged. The exact

12

Daei, Safari, and Dadashi

physical mechanism underlying these phenomena remains unknown. The results of applying both

the detrended ﬂuctuation and R/S analysis with the Hurst exponent (0.8 − 0.9) suggest that the

ARs system is categorized into SOC, which motivated us to conﬁrm such a characteristic by using

the complex network approach. In the present work, we designed the ARs network based on their

locations at the ﬁrst occurrence times and lifetimes. In our complex network, all ARs that occurred

in the lifetime of a speciﬁc AR are linked with each other. The unweighted adjacency matrix was

used to calculate the length scale and clustering coeﬃcient of the network. The degree of nodes was

computed for both the directed and undirected ARs networks. The main results of this study are

organized as follows:

– A comparison between both the values and behaviour of the clustering coeﬃcient of the ARs

network and the equivalent random network (with the same number of edges and nodes) indi-

cates that the ARs network is not a random network.

– The small values of the length scale and its logarithmic behaviour (ls = 0.74 log10 L) related

to the network size demonstrate that the ARs network is a small-world network. The obtained

results for the large values of the clustering coeﬃcient conﬁrm that the ARs network can be

classiﬁed in a category of the small-world network.

– The truncated power-law distribution was ﬁtted to the PDF of the nodes’ degree. The power-

law nature of the nodes’ degree demonstrates the scale-free feature of the ARs network. Recent

observations have shown that some of the ARs produce energetic phenomena (e.g. ﬂares, CMEs,

etc) and some others do not. Such characteristics of the ARs network are representative of the

prescription of the heterogeneous networks (e.g. Abe & Suzuki 2009).

– We observed an increase in ﬂare occurrence in each cell corresponding to the hubs. In other

words, the nodes with higher degrees in the ARs network have a higher likelihood to trigger

ﬂares (Figure 7). This behaviour of the ARs network raises an important question about the

prediction capability of ﬂares based on the ARs network. More statistical studies are required

to examine the ﬂare prediction with the ARs’ complex network.

ARs Complex Network

13

In the present study, we used the ARs information appearing on the main-side of the solar surface. By

employing the tracking algorithms on the reconstructed helioseismic maps (Lindsey & Braun 2000;

Hernndez et al. 2013), the returning far-side ARs can be identiﬁed. By increasing the lifetimes of

some ARs from two weeks to one month or more, the number of connections (edges and loops) for

some nodes of the ARs network may be increased. Additionally, some of the nodes may be empty

and, therefore, will be removed from the analysis. Expectedly, by decreasing the number of nodes

in the presence of the ARs with the large lifetimes, the diameter and the mean path length of the

network may also decrease while the clustering coeﬃcient may increase. More quantitative studies

are required to address the eﬀects of the far-side ARs information on the properties of the network.

In the next step, we attempt to include more characteristics of ARs (e.g. magnetic class, Hall

class, McIntosh class, sunspots) and study the eﬀects of changing solar latitudinal and longitudinal

displacements of the ARs during their lifetimes in order to investigate the prediction capability for

energetic solar events.

Figure 3. A small part of the ARs network comprising six nodes is represented. Each arrow represents
the edge between the two nodes. For example, the AR (NOAA 10081) emerges in node n680 during the
lifetime of AR (NOAA 10063) presented in node n557, so that a directed edge is drawn from n557 to n680.

Each self-loop shows the occurrence of two coinciding ARs in the same node. For example, the AR (NOAA

10205) appearing at the same node of AR (NOAA 10221) formed the self-loop.
