ABSTRACT
A central drop of ICM Fe abundance has been observed in several cool-core clusters. It has
been proposed that this abundance drop may be due, at least partially, to the depletion of Fe
into dust grains in the central, high-density regions. According to this scenario, noble gas
elements such as Ar and Ne are not expected to be depleted into dust, and therefore should
not show any drop, but follow the general increase of metal abundance toward the center. In
this work, we test this scenario by measuring with Chandra data the radial proﬁles of Ar and
Ne in a sample of 12 groups and clusters where a central drop in Fe abundance has been
detected. We conﬁrm the presence of the Fe drop in 10 out of 12 clusters at more than 2σ
c.l., and 4 Ar drops with similar signiﬁcance. We also ﬁnd 4 Ne drops, with the caveat that
Ne abundance measurement from CCD spectra suﬀers from systematics not completely under
control. Our results are consistent with an abundance drop common to the three elements.
When comparing the proﬁles, we ﬁnd that, on average, the abundance proﬁles of Ar and Ne
are signiﬁcantly higher than Fe and steeper toward the center, while they all gradually become
consistent with solar composition at r ≥ 0.05r500. We also check that Si and S proﬁles are
mostly consistent with Fe. This result conﬁrms a scenario in which some fraction of Fe is
depleted into dust grains in the inner regions, although the global central abundance drop is
mostly due to mechanical processes, like the displacement of metal-rich ICM from the very
center to larger radii by AGN-driven feedback. Finally, we report the detection of an Fe drop
in the cluster MACSJ1423.8+2404 at z = 0.543, showing that this feature appears early on in
cool-core clusters.

INTRODUCTION

X-ray observations of galaxy groups and clusters have shown that
the intracluster medium (ICM) in the core can be so dense that
the central cooling time is signiﬁcantly shorter than the cluster
lifetime, particularly in the innermost few tens of kpc, as measured
in high resolution Chandra data (see Cavagnolo et al. 2009). If
the cooling proceeded isobarically, the ICM would be doomed to
cool rapidly, forming a cooling ﬂow with a mass deposition rate
(cid:219)M that can reach 100 − 1000M(cid:12) yr−1, as directly derived from the
total X-ray luminosity of the core region (see Fabian 1994). Among
the unavoidable consequences, one would expect a large amount
of cold gas falling onto the central galaxy (called the brightest
cluster galaxy, from now on BCG) and a star formation rate (SFR)

comparable to the predicted (cid:219)M. However, the observed SFRs in
BCGs are observed to be modest, of the order of few M(cid:12) yr−1
(except few relevant cases), consistent with being entirely fueled by
the stellar mass loss from the BCG itself (Voit & Donahue 2011). In
addition, the amount of cold gas has been known since long time to
be much lower than that expected from the high cooling-ﬂow rates,
thanks to the measurements of CO emission from molecular gas and
other observables (see McNamara & O’Connell 1989; Edge 2001).
The ﬁnal blow to the isobaric cooling-ﬂow paradigm was provided
to the observations with the Reﬂection Grating Spectrometer (RGS)
onboard XMM-Newton, whose high resolution spectra of cluster
cores showed the absence of the metal emission lines associated
to gas cooler than ∼ 1/3 of the virial temperature (Peterson et al.
2001; Peterson & Fabian 2006). This ﬁnding, in turn, implies that
the bulk of the gas in the core must be prevented from cooling by
some heating mechanisms, leaving only a minority of the ICM, if
any, available for complete cooling. Eventually, the cooling-ﬂow

model has been superseded by the cool-core picture (Molendi &
Pizzolato 2001).

Many candidates have been proposed as contributors of the
heating process. Among them: cosmic rays (Böhringer & Morﬁll
1988), star formation and supernovae (Domainko et al. 2004; Li
& Bryan 2012), dissipation of gas turbulence induced either by
buoyancy of bubbles inﬂated by the central active galactic nucleus
(AGN) or by minor and major mergers (see McNamara & Nulsen
2007; Fabian 2012; Kravtsov et al. 2005; Heinz et al. 2006; Gaspari
et al. 2013), or a combination of mixing and heating associated
to vortices formed during the inﬂation of the bubbles (Hillel &
Soker 2016). The large amount of mechanical energy stored in the
bubbles carved in the ICM by radio jets makes AGN feedback
the strongest candidate as the main heating source. Thanks to the
unprecedented angular resolution of Chandra, the detailed X-ray
image of the Perseus cluster presented for the ﬁrst time a clear view
of the complex structures arising in the ICM due to AGN feedback,
such as cavities and ripples (Fabian et al. 2003, 2006). Recently, the
observations of the Perseus cluster with Hitomi provided a unique
measurement of the ICM dynamics associated to the feedback pro-
cess (Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2016). This increasing amount
of evidence clearly shows that the dynamics and thermodynamics
of the ICM are strongly aﬀected by AGN feedback, although the
discussion on the heating process is still open, and we are far from
having a coherent picture of the cycle of baryons in cool cores.

An unambiguous signature of these processes is left in the
metal abundance distribution and its evolution, a topic which rapidly
gained attention from the scientiﬁc community since the beginning
of the era of Chandra and XMM-Newton. Evidence of chemo-
dynamical impact of AGN feedback are now directly observed in
the X-ray data (Simionescu et al. 2009; Kirkpatrick et al. 2009;
O’Sullivan et al. 2011; Lovisari & Reiprich 2019), and, at the same
time, supported by continuously improving hydrodynamical simu-
lations (Roediger et al. 2007; Sijacki et al. 2007; Churazov et al.
2013). A striking example is provided by the observed enhancement
of metals around the bubbles (Kirkpatrick et al. 2011), strongly sug-
gesting that the inﬂation of the cavities uplifts the highly enriched
ICM bringing it at larger radii. Further insights came from detailed
studies of the metallicity peaks commonly observed at the center of
cool-core clusters at moderate and high redshift (De Grandi et al.
2004; McDonald et al. 2018). In particular, the measurement of the
broadening of the distribution of metals across cosmic epochs in
cool-core clusters provides further support to the nuclear activity as
the main contributor of metal mixing in the ICM (De Grandi et al.
2014). Recently, in Liu et al. (2018) we showed that the width of
the iron (Fe) peak increases by a factor of ∼3 from redshift z ∼ 1 to
z ∼ 0.05.

In this paper we focus on an apparently minor property of
the metal distribution in the ICM, which, instead, may provide a
relevant missing link between the hot and cold phases of the baryons
cycling in and around the BCGs. It consists in a small-scale (of the
order of 10 kpc) decrement at the center of the abundance peak
in cool cores, a feature that we call central abundance drop, and
that has long been known thanks to Chandra and XMM-Newton
studies of single, low-redshift clusters (Sanders & Fabian 2002;
Johnstone et al. 2002; Sanders & Fabian 2007; Million et al. 2010;
Panagoulia et al. 2013) and conﬁrmed recently by more extensive
studies (Panagoulia et al. 2015; Mernier et al. 2017). This feature is
better observed exploiting the high spatial resolution of the Chandra
satellite in cool-core clusters, but has also been conﬁrmed with
XMM-Newton in low redshift clusters (Mernier et al. 2017). In
addition, the abundance drop has been observed both in Fe, which

is the most prominent line-emitting element in X-ray spectra, and
in other elements like sulphur (S) and silicon (Si) (Mernier et al.
2017; Panagoulia et al. 2015). The Fe abundance drop has been
observed usually in association with cavities, and therefore it may
be ascribed to the local eﬀects of AGN feedback, eﬀectively pushing
the highly-enriched gas from the innermost regions toward larger
radii (Simionescu et al. 2009; Kirkpatrick et al. 2011). As a result,
the measured abundance will decrease somehow at small radii and
correspondingly increase at larger radii, at the point of inverting
locally the abundance gradient on a spatial scale corresponding to
the eﬃciency of the uplifting of the metal-enriched gas, and creating
the abundance drop. Clearly, the uplifting of the innermost, mostly
enriched gas implies a similar decrease for all the elements, also if
the mechanism is not due to the inﬂation of bubbles from the ICM,
but to other mechanical processes like core sloshing (Ghizzardi et al.
2014).

Other possible interpretations have been proposed, like con-
tamination from a central X-ray emitting AGN in the ICM spectrum,
or an underestimate of the helium content at small radii as a result
of mass sedimentation (Ettori & Fabian 2006; Mernier et al. 2017).
However, the former interpretation cannot explain abundance drops
which are observed far from the AGN position, nor the second inter-
pretation can justify why many cool-core clusters do not exhibit cen-
tral abundance drop. Another possible eﬀect is the non-negligible
optical depth of some resonance line, that may result, in principle,
in a decrease of the global ion abundance measured assuming an
optically-thin medium in the densest ICM regions. Resonance scat-
tering has been now measured for the Helium-like iron emission line
by Hitomi (Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2018), however, it appears
to be relevant only in the analysis of high-resolution spectra, while
it has a limited impact on the global metallicity measured from
CCD spectra and it is not eﬀective in removing the central dip (see
Sanders & Fabian 2006; Gendron-Marsolais et al. 2017). See, how-
ever Simionescu et al. (2019) for a more comprehensive discussion
on the comparison of high-resolution spectra with those obtained
from CCD data on the measurement of the abundance pattern in the
ICM.

Finally, a relevant physical mechanism that may play a role
here, is the depletion of Fe and several other metals (including Si
and S) into dust grains present in the diﬀuse gas close to the BCG.
This is supported by the detection of cold dust ﬁlaments in optical
and infrared in clusters with central abundance drop (Panagoulia
et al. 2013, 2015). Depletion of Fe and other reactive metals is ex-
pected if the enriched gas from star formation and stellar mass-loss
in the BCG remains cool and distinct from the hot surrounding
ICM, due to the higher ambient pressure (Voit & Donahue 2011).
Being trapped into dust ﬁlaments, a signiﬁcant part of Fe is released
into the ICM on a longer time scale and displaced with respect to
non-reactive elements, namely when the dust-rich gas is uplifted by
nuclear activity into lower-density and hotter regions (see discus-
sion in Panagoulia et al. 2013). This dust-depletion mechanism can
be tested by comparing the radial abundance proﬁles of Fe to that
of noble gas elements that are not expected to be embedded into
dust grains. The two noble elements that are potentially detectable
in high S/N spectra of clusters are neon (Ne) and argon (Ar). While
the former is hard to measure because blended with the dominant
emission from the Fe L-shell complex in CCD spectra, the latter
can be ﬁrmly detected thanks to the Ar XVII and Ar XVIII emis-
sion lines which appear isolated in the range 3.0–3.3 keV for low-z
clusters. Therefore, in this paper we aim at exploiting the angular
resolution of Chandra data to measure the spatially-resolved abun-
dance proﬁles of Ar, and possibly of Ne, in a sample of groups and

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (2018)

clusters in which a central Fe abundance drop has been previously
detected, and compare them to the proﬁles of Fe and other elements.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe
the sample of clusters and groups with previous detection of central
abundance drops, the data we use in this work, and our analysis
strategy. In Section 3, we present the measured radial abundance
proﬁles of Fe, Ar, Ne, Si and S, and show how our results can be
used to constrain the dust grain scenario. In Section 4, we discuss
the reliability of our spectral analysis strategy. Our conclusions
are summarized in Section 5. Throughout this paper, we adopt the
seven-year WMAP cosmology with ΩΛ = 0.73, Ωm = 0.27, and
H0 = 70.4 km s−1 Mpc−1 (Komatsu et al. 2011). Quoted error bars
correspond to a 1 σ conﬁdence level, unless noted otherwise.

2 CLUSTER SAMPLE, DATA REDUCTION AND

ANALYSIS

2.1 Selection of the sample

Our main scientiﬁc goal is to ﬁnd a signature of dust depletion
in the ICM of galaxy groups and clusters, in terms of a selective
decrement in the abundance of Fe, Si and S with respect to noble
elements in the central regions. Dust depletion into dust grains is
expected to be eﬃcient in high density environments, where some
of the enriched gas, particularly that associated to the stellar mass-
loss, remains cool and distinct from the hot ICM due to the high
pressure. Therefore, to constrain the impact of dust depletion on the
Fe distribution, we select a sample of cool-core clusters with a ﬁrm
detection of a central Fe drop. Due to the high angular resolution
needed for this study, we also require the use of Chandra data.

So far, the largest systematic investigation of abundance drop
across the Chandra archive is provided by the work of Panagou-
lia et al. (2015), where eight groups and clusters are reported to
have central abundance drop with high statistical signiﬁcance (NGC
4696/Centaurus, NGC 5846, 2A0335+096, NGC 4636 Abell 1991,
Abell 262, NGC 5813, NGC 5044). Detection of Fe drop in sin-
gle objects are reported for Abell 2199 (Johnstone et al. 2002),
Ophiuchus (Million et al. 2010), NGG 4696/Centaurus (Sanders &
Fabian 2002; Panagoulia et al. 2013), and Perseus (Sanders & Fabian
2007). In addition, 14 objects have been shown to have a decrease
of the Fe abundance in their core on the basis of XMM-Newton
data in Mernier et al. (2017). All of them have been observed also
by Chandra, and six were already included among the clusters with
signiﬁcant drop in Panagoulia et al. (2015). Among the remaining
eight, one is the Perseus clusters, while the remaining seven are
M49, M86, Abell 189 (NGC 533), Fornax, HCG62, NGC4325 and
Abell 3581, with the last three also included in Panagoulia et al.
(2015) among those with low-signiﬁcance Fe drop.

To draw a ﬁnal list of targets relevant for our study, we combine
all these sources and perform a preliminary test on the detectability
of the Ar line complex, by ﬁtting the spectrum of each cluster in the
innermost 20 kpc, then setting the Ar abundance ZAr to zero and
checking whether the ∆Cstat ≥ 2.7. With this criterion, we select
all the 8 clusters with high-signiﬁcance drop in Panagoulia et al.
(2015), plus Abell 2199, Ophiuchus, and Abell 3581. We exclude the
Perseus cluster (Sanders & Fabian 2007) since the exceptional data
quality for this cluster (1.4 Ms total exposure with Chandra) allows
one to attempt such an investigation in single 2D regions, rather
than an azimuthally-averaged proﬁle. For this reason we decided to
postpone the analysis of Perseus to another paper with a dedicated
2D, spatially-resolved spectral analysis.

Therefore, we identify 11 groups and clusters viable for our
study. Since all these well-documented cases are found at low red-
shift (z < 0.1), we also include, for the sake of discussion, a high-
redshift cluster where we serendipitously detected for the ﬁrst time
a shallow central drop (Liu et al. 2018, MACSJ1423.8+2404 at
z = 0.543). The list of the 12 clusters and groups discussed in this
work is shown in Table 1, where we also report the X-ray data,
redshift, total exposure time and r500 as measured in the literature.
Clearly, we made best use of the Chandra archive, and include all the
available observations for each cluster. However, we exclude a few
obsid when they have diﬀerent data acquisition mode or period, and,
at the same time, provide a minor contribution to the total exposure
time. Therefore, we discard Obsid 788 for NGC5846, Obsid 1650
for A3581, Obsid 1657 for MACSJ1423, and Obsid 504, 505, 4190
and 4191 for Centaurus. We remind that we are not interested in a
complete sample of clusters and groups with a central abundance
drop, but we just require a reliable sample to investigate whether
we can identify the signature of dust depletion with our analysis
strategy. Essentially, our sample is mostly based on the results of
Panagoulia et al. (2015) and Mernier et al. (2017) for the Fe proﬁle,
with the inclusion of a few other well studied cases.

2.2 Data reduction

Data reduction is performed with CIAO 4.10, adopting the latest
release of the Chandra Calibration Database at the time of writ-
ing (CALDB 4.7.8). Unresolved sources within the ICM, typically
due to AGN not associated to the cluster, are identiﬁed with wavde-
tect, checked visually and eventually removed. In particular, we
pay attention to possible nuclear emission from the BCG, that may
aﬀect the spectrum of the innermost bin. Nuclear emission from the
BCG is found in about 20% of all the clusters, and preferentially
in cool cores, despite the AGN luminosity is typically low, of the
order of 1043 erg s−1 (see Yang et al. 2018). Thanks to the angular
resolution of Chandra, this consists in removing a circle of ∼ 1.2
arcsec at the center of the innermost bin.

The spectra are extracted in circular concentric rings, centered
at the peak of X-ray emission in 0.5–7 keV band image, smoothed
with a Gaussian function with full width at half-maximum ∼ 1.5
arcsec after removing unresolved sources. The annuli are chosen
adaptively on the image to ensure a roughly equal number of net
counts, and in any case larger than 2000 in the 0.5–7 keV band, in
each annulus. For clusters with multiple observations, we extract the
spectrum and compute the response matrix ﬁle (RMF) and ancillary
response ﬁle (ARF) for each observation separately. Background
spectra are extracted from regions far from the ICM emission in
each Obsid. When the ICM emission ﬁlls the entire CCD, we use the
background generated from the ‘blank sky’ ﬁles with the blanksky
script. This choice may not be accurate in the outermost regions
beyond 0.1r500 which, however, are not relevant in this work. In the
core regions we discuss here, the accuracy of few percent provided
by the ‘blank sky’ background spectra is not aﬀecting our results.

2.3 Spectral analysis strategy

The spectral ﬁts are performed with Xspec 12.10.1 (Arnaud
1996) using C-statistics (Cash 1979). All the abundance values
in this paper are relative to the solar values of Asplund et al. (2009).
We note that these photospheric results are signiﬁcantly smaller, for
the most abundant elements like C, N, O, Ne and Fe, than those rec-
ommended in the widely used compilations of Anders & Grevesse

(1989) and Grevesse & Sauval (1998). In particular, the Fe abun-
dance in solar units turns out to be larger by a factor ∼ 1.6. Galactic
absorption is described by the model tbabs (Wilms et al. 2000),
where the best-choice for the value of Galactic HI column density
is initially set to the value corresponding to the cluster position in
the HI survey of Kalberla et al. (2005). However, we notice in sev-
eral cases that a diﬀerent value of N HGal is needed to obtain an
acceptable ﬁt, therefore we leave the N HGal parameter free to vary
(see the Discussion section for further details). For clusters with
multiple observations, the spectra corresponding to the same ring
are ﬁtted with linked parameters.

Particular care must be taken in modeling the thermal structure
of the ICM, since we necessarily have more than one temperature
component in each spectrum. This may be simply due to projection
eﬀects of background and foreground ICM belonging to outer shells
in presence of strong temperature and abundance gradients across
the line of sight, particularly in the innermost regions. We also know
that the complex ICM structure in strong cool-cores with cavities can
create strong departure from spherical symmetry. This complexity is
clearly emerging thanks to the high signal spectra in our sample, and,
therefore, it is not possible to assume a dominant single-temperature
component in each bin, particularly because this choice may bias
the metallicity low, as noticed in several studies (Buote 2000; Buote
et al. 2003; Gastaldello et al. 2010). Therefore, in this work we adopt
the simplest approach which provides statistically acceptable ﬁts,
which consists in using two temperatures in each spectrum. Previous
works investigating the abundance drop in cool core clusters already
showed that a two-temperature model is relatively unaﬀected by
projection eﬀects and return reliable values of metal abundance
(Panagoulia et al. 2013). We also verify a posteriori the goodness
of the ﬁt to make sure that our strategy provides an acceptable
modelization of the observed spectrum. Finally, we assume that
the abundance of each element we consider is the same in both
temperature components, a choice that is necessary to obtain robust
results and will be further detailed in the Discussion section.

The emission lines of Ar and Ne have very diﬀerent diagnos-
tics. The signal from Ar is contributed by the Kα lines of Ar XVII
and Ar XVIII (He-like and H-like Ar) which appear clearly above
the continuum in the energy range ∼3.0–3.3 keV, far from other
emission lines. In this case, the capability of detecting Ar depends
merely on the strength of the signal, on the Ar abundance itself, and
on the ICM temperature, so that the associated error is essentially

dominated by Poisson noise. The diagnostics for Ne is completely
diﬀerent, since the Kα lines from Ne X and Ne IX are blended
with the overwhelming Fe XXII–XIX line complex (plus the less
prominent O VII and O VIII line complex) at ∼ 1 keV, and cannot
be resolved into single lines at the spectral resolution of ACIS-I
or ACIS-S. Clearly, the value and the associated error of the Ne
abundance is dramatically dependent on the capability of properly
modeling the complex line blend around 1 keV, which may well
not reproduced with only two temperatures. For this reason the Ne
proﬁle has been measured only in a few cases so far (see de Plaa
et al. 2004). Despite that, we present and discuss our measurements
of Ne abundance obtained with the two-temperature assumption,
with the caveat that the associated errors is a lower limit to the real
uncertainty.

According to this scheme, we measure the abundance of met-
als by ﬁtting the projected spectrum in each annulus with a double
vapec thermal plasma emission model (Smith et al. 2001) with
AtomDB version 3.0.9, leaving free the two temperatures and the
corresponding emission measure (normalization), the Galactic ab-
sorption N HGal, and the abundances of Fe, Ar, Ne, S, Si, O, Mg,
and Ca which are assumed to be the same in the two temperature
components. All the other abundance values are linked to Fe. The
abundance of Helium is always ﬁxed to solar value.

Finally, in this work we focus on the projected quantities, with
no attempt to deproject the abundance proﬁles we obtain, similarly
to the approach of Mernier et al. (2017). Deprojection procedures,
which are commonly adopted in the literature mostly to obtain
3D temperature proﬁles and measure hydrostatic masses (see, e.g.,
Churazov et al. 2003; Russell et al. 2008) are known to have little
eﬀects on the abundance proﬁles (see also Rasmussen & Ponman
2007). In addition, the complexity of the thermal structure in cool
cores, particularly with evident cavities, would result in an incorrect
result if deprojected under the assumption of spherical symmetry,
as noticed by Panagoulia et al. (2015).

3 RADIAL ABUNDANCE PROFILES

In this work we are mostly interested in the comparison of the Fe
proﬁles to those of Ar and, with the mentioned caveats, Ne. We also
discuss S and Si that are expected to be also depleted similarly to
Fe, while we are not able to obtain an accurate characterization of

the proﬁles of O, Ca and Mg, which, therefore, are not included in
this investigation.

The azimuthally-averaged, projected abundance proﬁles of
ZFe, ZAr and ZNe for the 12 clusters in our sample are shown in
Figure 1, while the proﬁles of Si and S are shown in Figure 2. From
a visual inspection, we see that we are able to conﬁrm a statistically
signiﬁcant Fe drop in most of the clusters, and to identify drop in
the Ar abundance in some of them. We also notice that the shape of
the Ne proﬁles often appears to be consistent or at least comparable
with that of Fe and Ar, suggesting that Ne proﬁles are plausible, and
that, despite our measured Ne proﬁle may be aﬀected by unknown
statistical uncertainties, we deﬁnitely have a statistically-signiﬁcant
global detection of Ne across the sample in the core region.

Since the Fe proﬁles of these clusters have been already pub-
lished, despite with diﬀerent analysis techniques and, in some cases,
diﬀerent data sets, we carefully check for diﬀerences between our
results and the literature. If we compare our projected proﬁles with
the deprojected Fe proﬁles in Panagoulia et al. (2015), we ﬁnd a
good agreement, except in a few remarkable cases. In NGC5813
we ﬁnd a clear smooth drop in the innermost 5 kpc, opposed to
the sharp drop within 5 kpc in Panagoulia et al. (2015). We also
ﬁnd a smoother and more pronounced iron drop in A3581, which is
considered only a possible drop in Panagoulia et al. (2015), despite
their large error bars create no tension with our proﬁle. While these
diﬀerences may be due to the deprojection procedure, the results for
2A0335 are dramatically discrepant. In this cluster we ﬁnd an iron
peak opposed to the well deﬁned iron drop shown in Panagoulia
et al. (2015). We actually ﬁnd that switching from 1T apec model
to our reference 2T apec model is critical to ﬁnd the peak. We also
ﬁnd a strong dependence of the temperature proﬁle on the N HGal
value, which we measure to be 3.1 × 1021 cm−2 as in Pinto et al.
(2015), as opposed to lower value used for this clusters in Panagou-
lia et al. (2015). The value of N HGal is found to strongly aﬀect
the Fe abundance particularly for a 2T apec model. Our result is in
agreement with Werner et al. (2006). However, the peculiar nature
of the core of 2A0335, characterized by bright blobs and a com-
plex metallicity map in the 2D analysis (see Sanders et al. 2009)
suggests that assuming azymuthally average value for the ICM may
provide contradictory results depending on details of the analysis,
including the choice of the center (we assumed the BCG position in
this case). We conclude that 2A0335 should not be included among
the list of clusters showing a central Fe drop. We also ﬁnd consis-
tency with Lakhchaura et al. (2018) for the Fe and Ar proﬁles of

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (2018)

the Centaurus cluster, despite the diﬀerent choice of the size of the
radial bins hampers a detailed comparison. We also ﬁnd that our
projected Fe proﬁle of the Ophiuchus cluster and the deprojected
one in Million et al. (2010) are compatible. Despite the diﬀerent
angular resolution makes it very diﬃcult the comparison of Chan-
dra and XMM-Newton proﬁles in the innermost regions, we ﬁnd
a broad consistency with the Fe proﬁles of NGC4636, NGC5044,
NGC5813 measured with XMM-Newton in Mernier et al. (2017),
while we notice some diﬀerences in the cases of A3581, NGC5846
and Perseus. Signiﬁcant diﬀerence, instead, are found for A262 and
A1991, which were, in fact, not classiﬁed as Fe-drop by Mernier
et al. (2017). Overall, we ﬁnd that the Fe proﬁles obtained with our
approach are broadly consistent with literature, while signiﬁcant
diﬀerences occur in particular cases with extremely complex core
structure, or in data with lower angular resolution.

We note, however, that the precise identiﬁcation of the central
drop is not straightforward and may be rather uncertain if based
on, e.g., the distance between the highest and the lowest values in
each proﬁle, since it would be sensitive to the width of the annuli,
and blurred by the statistical noise. Therefore, to better quantify
the abundance drops in a uniform way, we ﬁt each proﬁle with an
empirical function with ﬁve free parameters, able to reproduce a
smooth, non-monotonic proﬁle:

Z(r) = A ·

where the parameters B and D are the spatial scales corresponding
to the drop in the inner few tens of kpc, and the outer proﬁle,
respectively, while the parameter C corresponds to the minimum
value in the center. This functional shape is a simpliﬁed version
of the proﬁle used to described the temperature in Vikhlinin et al.
(2006), and it is overdetermined given our data quality. However, this
function can reasonably reproduce the behaviour of all the diﬀerent
proﬁles. We stress that the parameters in the function have no direct
physical meanings, but allow us to obtain a ﬁt to all the proﬁles
and the associated uncertainty as a function of the physical radius.
The ﬁt of the proﬁle and the uncertainty on ∆Z are obtained with a
Monte Carlo approach. Eventually, we visually inspect the proﬁles
to search for any poor ﬁtting and check the χ2 values, ﬁnding that in
all the cases we obtain acceptable ﬁts. We remark that in the ﬁts we
allowed the minimum abundance values in each bin to be negative,
an aspect that hardly aﬀect single-cluster proﬁles (only a few points
in Ophiuchus and A2199 turn out to be negative) but is relevant

of the other sources. Formally, we also ﬁnd a central drop in Ne
abundance in 4 clusters (NGC5846, NGC5813, A3581, and A1991)
at more than 2σ. We notice that, given the larger uncertainties
in the proﬁles of Ar and Ne, our results are consistent with an
abundance drop common to the three elements, which suggests
a mechanical process removing the highly enriched ICM from the
innermost region as an explanation for the observed proﬁles. We also
remark that the detection of abundance drop in MACSJ1423.8+2404
at z = 0.543 implies that this feature is also present in high redshift
clusters, and that the mechanism generating it has already taken
place at a look-back time of ∼6 Gyr.

We can push further our analysis by stacking the abundance
proﬁles of each element after rescaling the radius of each cluster
by r500. We divide the [0–0.15] r500 interval into 6 bins choosing
the width in order to have a comparable number of data points
in each bin. The values of r500 are taken from the compilation
of clusters presented in Pinto et al. (2015) and Liu et al. (2018).
We then average all the data points in each bin weighted by the
inverse squared errors and by the overlap of the geometric area of
each physical annulus with the ﬁnal bin, following the method of
Leccardi & Molendi (2008). In addition, we also allow the free
abundance parameters to be negative for the stacking, since this is
the only way to properly deal with noise. As discussed in Leccardi
& Molendi (2008), forcing the abundance to be always positive may
result in a positive statistical bias when averaging out the proﬁles.
In the investigation of the stacked proﬁles we consider also S and
Si, whose single-cluster proﬁles are shown in Figure 2.

The stacked abundance proﬁles of Fe, Ar, Ne, Si, and S are
shown in the top panel of Figure 3. We ﬁnd that in the central
regions, the average abundances of Ar and Ne in our sample are
signiﬁcantly higher than that of Fe, while they tend to be consistent
in the outermost bin, corresponding to [0.05–0.15] r500. On the
other hand, the proﬁles of Si and S are consistent with Fe within
1σ, despite they tend to show a slight increase. However, the most
interesting and convincing feature is the much larger gradient of
the Ar and Ne proﬁles with respect to Fe, Si and S, which are all
elements that may be depleted into cold dust grains. It is useful
to remind that at larger radii, Ar abundance has been shown to be
comparable or lower with respect to Fe (see Mernier et al. 2017).
The same behaviour can be seen in the absolute diﬀerence of the
abundance of diﬀerent elements as a function of radius, which is
shown in the lower panel of Figure 3. We ﬁnd that the diﬀerence
ZAr − ZFe decreases systematically with radius, while ZSi − ZFe
and ZS − ZFe show a much milder decrease with radius. We cannot
draw any conclusion on the quantity ZNe − ZFe given the large
uncertainties, not to mention the unknown systematics. Finally, we
veriﬁed a-posteriori that the stacked proﬁles are not dominated by
the Centaurus cluster, despite it has by far the highest quality spectra.
The stacked proﬁles obtained after excluding the Centaurus cluster
have only negligible diﬀerences with respect to the results shown in
Figure 3.

In Table 2 we also list the distance of the abundance peak of
each element from the peak in the X-ray surface brightness, and,
in the last column, the displacement of the BCG from the X-ray
peak. We unambiguously identify the BCG of all the clusters but
MACSJ1423.8+2404. The coordinates of the BCG come from the
2MASS catalog or NED/SIMBAD. The position of the abundance
peak is measured from the best-ﬁt of the abundance proﬁle of the
corresponding element. For most of the clusters, we ﬁnd that DBCG
is much smaller than the distance from the abundance peak to the
cluster center, implying that the BCG is inside the ‘hole’ carved
into the abundance distribution. There is only one exception: the

particularly in the stacking procedure, that may be slightly biased
high if all the values are forced to be positive.

From the the best-ﬁt analytic function, we can directly quantify
the central abundance drop as ∆Z = Zpeak − Zin, where Zin is the
ﬁtted abundance at the radius of the innermost bin, and Zpeak is
the maximum value of the ﬁtted abundance. The uncertainty on
∆Z is obtained by assuming the 1σ uncertainties of Zpeak and Zin
and summing them in quadrature. A central drop is identiﬁed only
when ∆Z has a signiﬁcance level higher than 2σ. The measured
values of ∆Z are shown for Fe, Ar and Ne in the second, third and
fourth column, respectively, of Table 2. Our results conﬁrm that all
the clusters in our sample exhibit a central Fe abundance drop at
more than 2σ c.l., except for A2199 and 2A0335. However, we ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant Ar drop in only 4 sources (NGC5813, Centaurus, A2199,
and A1991) at more than 2σ, despite we have hints of a drop in most

Ophiuchus cluster, with DBCG=2.25 kpc, and DFe=3.5 ± 1.1 kpc.
This is consistent with the clear signatures of an ongoing merger
found by Million et al. (2010). For this cluster, we recompute the
abundance proﬁles after setting the center on the position of the
BCG, and we obtain a consistent result. In Figure 4 we show the
relation between DFe, DAr, DNe and DBCG. We ﬁnd no statistically
signiﬁcant trend among the BCG displacement and the position of
the peak of the abundance proﬁles. Therefore, we conclude that
there is no association between the displacement of the abundance
peak (as a proxy for the size of the abundance drop region) and the
oﬀset of the BCG with respect to the X-ray centroid in our sample.
To summarize, we ﬁnd 4 clusters with a drop in the Ar abun-
dance proﬁle at more than 2σ c.l., compared to 10 clusters with an
Fe drop at the same signiﬁcance level. This indication of a diﬀerent
spatial distribution among this two elements is further strengthened
by our analysis of the stacked proﬁles, where the normalization and
the slope of the Ar proﬁle are clearly diﬀerent from that of Fe, im-
plying a larger Ar abundance in the core regions at radii ≤ 0.05 r500.
Possibly, the same trend is present in the Ne proﬁle. At the same
time, we ﬁnd overall consistency between the proﬁle of Fe, Si, and
S, apart from a modest enhancement, conﬁrming a signiﬁcant dif-
ference in the spatial distribution of elements that may be depleted
into dust grains, and of noble elements. Therefore, despite our anal-
ysis conﬁrms that the abundance drop is a characteristic shared by
all the elements, suggesting that the uplifting of high metallicity gas
driven by bubbles is an eﬀective process, we also found a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between Ne and Ar and the other elements. This result
implies that the depletion of Fe into dust grains during the baryon
cycle in cool-core groups and clusters is also an eﬀective process in
shaping the abundance proﬁles. Since here we focus on projected
values, further assumptions and a detailed modelization are both
needed before quantifying the eﬀects of dust depletion in terms of
Fe mass-loss, a task which goes beyond the scope of this paper.

4 DISCUSSION: ROBUSTNESS OF THE SPECTRAL

ANALYSIS

In this section we discuss some aspects of our spectral analysis
which may potentially introduce ﬁtting bias. The ﬁrst aspect is the
choice of leaving the Galactic absorption parameter N HGal free to
vary in each bin. It is a common choice in X-ray spectral ﬁtting to
freeze N HGalto the value of Kalberla et al. (2005). However, given
the high signal of our spectra, and the complex thermal structure
in each bin, a ﬂuctuation in N HGal (which, we remind, is obtained
from an HI map smoothed on a scale of ∼ 1 deg) may bias one
or both the temperature components of our model. To investigate
the robustness of our strategy, we compare the best-ﬁt values of
N HGal, averaged across the annuli in each cluster, with the value
from Kalberla et al. (2005). As shown in Figure 5, the values are
often consistent within 1σ, but a slight positive bias is observed
with the best ﬁt values being on average ∼ 20% higher. We repeated
our ﬁt forcing N HGal to be equal to the HI value, and found that
our results do not change qualitatively, except in the remarkable
case of 2A0335, as discussed in Section 3. However, in many cases
the quality of the ﬁt is signiﬁcantly worse, and this is reﬂected
in a systematic underestimation of the statistical error bars on the
abundance values. The results presented in this work therefore are
conservatively based on the ﬁts obtained with free N HGal.

A more fundamental and critical aspect of our analysis is the
model of thermal structure of the ICM, which we approximate with
two temperature components. We explore the eﬀects of assuming
a more complex underlying temperature structure, despite it can-
not be constrained eﬃciently with CCD data. To do that, we repeat
our ﬁt with a cevmkl model, which is used to model the emission
from a multi-temperature plasma. Emission measures from diﬀer-
ent temperature components follow a power-law in temperature,
while the abundance ratios are deﬁned in the usual way and are
shared by all the temperature components. While we ﬁx the min-
imum temperature to a reference value of 0.5 keV, the maximum
temperature is set to a value somewhat larger than the largest tem-

perature we found in our reference analysis, and leave the slope of
the emission measure-temperature relation free to vary. In this way
we can explore the eﬀects of having a continuous distribution of
temperatures with respect to assuming only two values. We ﬁnd
that our results do not change signiﬁcantly, as shown in Figure 6,
where we plot the Fe, Ar, Ne, Si and S proﬁles obtained in the two
modelizations (2T vapec compared to cevmkl) for Centaurus and
Abell 1991, which represent the highest and lowest quality spectra
in our sample. Not unexpectedly, the Ne proﬁle is the only one that
is noticeably aﬀected, conﬁrming our caveats that our results for Ne
strongly depend on the modelization of the ∼ 1 keV line emission
blend, and therefore are particularly sensitive to the thermal model
we assume. Since we have no reasons to prefer a cevmkl rather than
a double vapec model, we decide to keep Ne proﬁles according to
our reference analysis, conﬁrming the warning on unknown sys-
tematic uncertainties in addition to the statistical errors. Finally, we
warn that diﬀerences between the results from vapec and cevmkl
may also be due to diﬀerent modelization of the Fe-L line complex
built-in the two models. In particular, our reference model vapec
is continuously updated, while cevmkl and mekal are no longer
updated since several years. Some diﬀerences in the model may
show up despite the low resolution of CCD spectra, but are typi-
cally smaller than the typical statistical uncertainties we have in our
data. A systematic comparison of the diﬀerent atomic models goes
beyond the goals of this paper. 1

Another source of potential systematics in our approach can
be due to the use of a single abundance value common to the two
temperature components. In general, the two temperatures should
be considered a proxy for the real temperature structure of the ICM
along the line of sight. This, in turn, can be due to the projection
of ICM at diﬀerent temperature, or to the presence of diﬀerent

phases at the same radius, or both. In any case, the abundance
values associated to diﬀerent temperature components may well
be diﬀerent, and there are no compelling reasons to force them to
be equal. This is expected on the basis of the much scattered but
clear correlation between metallicity and temperature in the core
of clusters, or between metallicity and entropy (see Liu et al. 2018,
for a recent measurement of the abundance-entropy correlation in a
sample of Chandra clusters). However, because of the modest CCD
spectral resolution, if we relax the hypothesis of a single abundance
value dominating the emission in each ring, the degeneracy between
the temperature and abundance would be so large to hamper the
measurement of abundance radial proﬁles other then Fe. The next
major step forward to take in this direction will be oﬀered by X-ray
bolometers, which will allow one to resolve single lines across the
soft X-ray spectrum and provide a mean to associate an abundance
value to each temperature component, enabling at the same time
a much more structured thermal modelization. Admittedly, in this
work we are compelled to assume a single abundance value for all
the temperature components in each annulus, but we are aware that
this assumption may be tested at least in the only available data
obtained with an X-ray bolometer thanks to the Hitomi mission
(Hitomi Collaboration et al. 2016). Therefore, we postpone this test
to a more detailed work on the Perseus cluster.

Finally, it has been found that eﬀective area calibrations
are diﬀerent among major, currently-available X-ray CCDs (see
Simionescu et al. 2019), and this eﬀect can bias the measurement
of metal abundance, particularly when the ﬁt is driven by energy
range far from that where the relevant lines are. In other words, the
level of continuum can be poorly ﬁtted, and this can severely aﬀect
the equivalent width of faint lines. For example, we notice that in
a few cases (Centaurus, A262 and Ophiuchus) the maximum mea-
sured value of the Ar abundance is remarkably higher than 2 Z (cid:12). To
investigate whether these high values were actually spurious, ﬁrst
we perform a visual check, ﬁnding that the continuum level appears
to be properly ﬁtted in our spectra. A few relevant examples are

and 6 with ZAr = 1.82 ± 0.21, 2.51 ± 0.20 and 2.67 ± 0.20, respec-
tively), A262 (bin 1, 2, and 3 with ZAr = 2.04 ± 0.93, 2.59 ± 1.12
and 3.01 ± 1.09, respectively), and Ophiuchus (bin 1, 2, and 7 with
ZAr = 2.63 ± 1.42, 3.39 ± 1.47 and 2.38 ± 1.39, respectively). We
recall that the best-ﬁt models, shown as solid lines, are obtained
separately ﬁtting the spectra from single Obsid, and not the stacked
spectrum. In all the cases the uncertainties in the continuum ap-
pear to be well within the statistical uncertainties, despite for the
Ophiuchus cluster the spectrum is very noisy and the uncertainty
on Ar abundance may be larger than the estimated error bars. We
veriﬁed that our results do not change after removing the proﬁle
of the Ophiuchus cluster from the stacked abundance proﬁles. We
conclude that the unexpectedly high values of Ar abundance found
in some bins are properly characterized and have well-measured
uncertainties, except one case that may be aﬀected by systematics,
but is not relevant to our main conclusions.

To better test the robustness of our results with respect to cali-
bration uncertainties, we adopt the strategy followed in Lakhchaura
et al. (2018), where the abundances are remeasured in the 2.9–3.5
keV narrow band by leaving the normalization free, and the temper-
ature, Galactic absorption frozen to the best-ﬁt values of the broad

band ﬁt. In particular, we show in Figure 8 the Ar abundance pro-
ﬁles in Centaurus and A262 computed in the narrow band and broad
band ﬁts. Although some diﬀerence is present, the signiﬁcance of
the drop in the Ar abundance is not aﬀected. Therefore, we conﬁrm
that our results are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by clear uncertainties
in the broad-band Chandra calibration.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work we analyze the abundance proﬁles in clusters where a
central drop in the Fe abundance has been reported in the literature.
Our aim is to test the origin of this feature, which may be associated
to a mechanical process, like the uplifting of highly-enriched ICM
in the center by AGN feedback, or to Fe depletion into dust grains,
or to both processes. We exploit the exquisite angular resolution of
Chandra to measure the abundance in the innermost regions of a
sample of 12 cool-core clusters, thanks to the spectral resolution
of the ACIS detectors. In particular, we compute the abundance
proﬁle of Ar and, within the limits of our assumptions, Ne, that
cannot be incorporated into dust, and therefore should not exhibit
a central abundance drop if due to dust depletion, when compared

can be observed in the abundance proﬁles of nearby, bright groups
and clusters as a diﬀerence between the abundance proﬁles of noble
gas like Ar and Ne and that of dust-depletable elements like Fe, Si
and S. While some additional work can be done in this ﬁeld on the
basis of CCD data from the Chandra and XMM-Newton archives, a
major improvement will be enabled only by the use of future X-ray
bolometers. The capability of measuring with high accuracy the
amount of Fe lost from the ICM because of dust depletion will be
an important information to constrain the cycle of baryons in the
center of cool-core clusters and the interplay of the ICM with the
insterstellar medium of the BCG.

to the abundance proﬁles of other elements like Fe, Si or S. Our
conclusions are summarized as follows.

• We conﬁrm the detection of the Fe drop in 10 out of 12 clusters
at a signiﬁcance level larger than 2σ, in broad agreement with the
literature.

• We are able to compute Ar abundance proﬁles out to ∼ 0.15r500
after assuming a two-temperature structure for the ICM. We also
present the proﬁles of Ne, which, however, are likely aﬀected by
systematics due to partial modeling of the line emission blend in-
cluding Ne lines. We are, however, able to show that our abundance
proﬁles for all the other metals (Fe, Ar, Si and S) are not signiﬁ-
cantly aﬀected by our speciﬁc choice for the thermal modelization
of the ICM.

• We ﬁnd central abundance drops of Ar in 4 clusters at a con-
ﬁdence level of more than 2σ, and, formally, 4 clusters with abun-
dance drops of Ne. Si and S abundance proﬁles are found to be
broadly consistent with Fe. Overall, our results are consistent with
all the metals showing a central drop in abundance, therefore sug-
gesting that a mechanical process directly removing the highly en-
riched ICM from the center, as the observed uplift of dense ICM
driven by cavities carved by the central AGN, should be the main
origin of the central abundance drops.

• We further extend our results by stacking the proﬁles in six
bins in the range [0–0.15]r500, ﬁnding that Ar (and possibly Ne)
has signiﬁcantly larger abundance in the center with respect to Fe,
Si and S, and that its proﬁle shows a much steeper gradient. This
result, in turn, suggests that the dust grain scenario is indeed taking
place in the center of these clusters, and has a signiﬁcant eﬀect in
producing the Fe drop, which sums up to the mechanical removal
of the most enriched gas. We successfully test the robustness of our
conclusions with respect to the thermal modelization of the ICM,
the spectral analysis strategy and possible calibration uncertainties.
• We conﬁrm the detection of central Fe abundance drop in the
galaxy cluster MACSJ1423.8+2404 at redshift 0.543, indicating that
this feature is not conﬁned to low redshift clusters, but has occurred
in this cool-core cluster at least ∼ 6 Gyr ago.

To summarize, we conclude that the signature of dust depletion
